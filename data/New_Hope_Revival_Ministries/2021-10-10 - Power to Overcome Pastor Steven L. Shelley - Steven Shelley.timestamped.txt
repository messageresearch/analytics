[54:05] what a what a great
[54:07] blessing the lord is faithful
[54:15] before our pastor comes today i would
[54:17] just
[54:18] like to take a moment to say a word or
[54:20] two
[54:22] through the years being a pastor's son
[54:25] i have
[54:26] seen a lot of stuff
[54:28] and when we moved to virginia the word
[54:31] appreciate was shortened
[54:33] to appreciate
[54:37] and when people would come up and shake
[54:39] your hand they would not say god bless
[54:42] you
[54:43] or i love you they would say appreciate
[54:46] you
[54:48] this became a phrase that i did not like
[54:53] because it seemed to be just a
[54:57] a greeting of sorts that
[54:59] was
[55:00] kind of um generic
[55:03] didn't really like it
[55:05] and so through the years
[55:08] we remember matthew mueller and him
[55:10] telling a story about something and
[55:13] using that same phrase appreciate you
[55:16] and i just don't really care for it
[55:18] but today is pastor appreciation sunday
[55:22] and i would like to say
[55:24] i love you and i appreciate you
[55:27] so much

[56:25] the word and allowing the holy spirit to
[56:28] lead him to more and more truth
[56:30] and i appreciate
[56:32] the truth
[56:34] that we are privileged to hear in this
[56:37] place
[56:38] the truth that
[56:40] sets us free that makes us free if we'll
[56:44] allow it to
[56:46] it will make us free if we'll allow the
[56:49] truth to do that in our lives
[56:51] i am thankful for the stand that brother
[56:53] shelley has made through the years
[56:56] that he has uh held on to this truth
[56:59] that we love so dearly and i'm grateful
[57:02] today to be able to call him pastor god

[1:06:50] these remind me of those days
[1:06:53] today is a very very very very very very
[1:06:57] special day
[1:06:58] because one of the seniors
[1:07:01] in our church the most senior member of
[1:07:05] our church
[1:07:06] for a long long long time she has been
[1:07:09] with us
[1:07:10] she came here
[1:07:12] her husband sent her with the girls
[1:07:15] many years ago and
[1:07:17] she never left and she has been a
[1:07:20] faithful faithful
[1:07:22] blessing in our lives
[1:07:25] and sometime when we're not pushed for
[1:07:27] time i will tell you some of you don't
[1:07:30] know i realize there's a generation of
[1:07:32] you that don't even know
[1:07:33] the sacrifice that she made for me she
[1:07:36] called me pastor son
[1:07:38] and she made a sacrifice for me many
[1:07:41] many many times
[1:07:43] to keep me on the road when i was young
[1:07:45] enough to travel all the time
[1:07:47] and strong enough to do that
[1:07:50] and they would literally i'll just tell
[1:07:52] this part they would literally load the
[1:07:55] it's against the law now i guess but
[1:07:57] they would
[1:07:58] should i tell that
[1:08:00] they would load a recliner
[1:08:02] bin in the back of the van
[1:08:04] and come and take me somewhere to preach
[1:08:07] and
[1:08:08] i i would get through preaching and get
[1:08:10] in that recliner and sleep on the way
[1:08:11] home so i could preach here the next day
[1:08:14] and she would sometimes meet me atlanta
[1:08:17] airport
[1:08:18] take my suitcases from me check me in i
[1:08:21] would check in a hotel for the night
[1:08:23] she because i'd fly out early the next
[1:08:25] morning her and the girls would come
[1:08:27] home
[1:08:28] this is before i was married
[1:08:30] and they would wash my clothes
[1:08:34] re-iron them re-fold them re-pack them
[1:08:36] and before i was able to
[1:08:38] get to the airport the next morning hand
[1:08:40] deliver them to me
[1:08:42] now that's how much they loved me and
[1:08:44] that's how much they loved me
[1:08:46] and they played a very important role in
[1:08:48] part of the ministry
[1:08:50] and today sister isabel weems is 85
[1:08:53] years old and looking really blessed
[1:08:56] would you all wish her a happy birthday

[1:12:54] that in me
[1:12:56] you might have
[1:12:58] peace
[1:13:00] shalom
[1:13:01] now that's not
[1:13:03] the greek word that's the hebrew word
[1:13:06] but this is the kind of full piece
[1:13:10] complete
[1:13:11] peace
[1:13:12] that is described by the hebrew word
[1:13:15] shalom
[1:13:17] these things i have spoken unto you that
[1:13:19] in me you might have peace
[1:13:22] in the world you shall have tribulation
[1:13:26] i think that sounds prophetic it sounds
[1:13:28] like a declaration or a
[1:13:30] prophetic word in the world you shall
[1:13:34] have tribulation
[1:13:36] but be of good cheer
[1:13:39] i
[1:13:40] have overcome
[1:13:41] the world
[1:13:43] this is red letter
[1:13:45] this is jesus talking
[1:13:47] he said i have overcome the world i'm
[1:13:50] not promising you that you won't have
[1:13:52] trouble
[1:13:53] but i'm telling you that i have overcome
[1:13:55] it all on your behalf
[1:13:58] and you can take your rest in me
[1:14:01] i'm going to release peace to you
[1:14:04] now i want you to know this morning
[1:14:05] there is a peace that passes all
[1:14:08] understanding and endures forever
[1:14:11] and that peace is a gift from god
[1:14:14] it's not the absence of trouble it's a
[1:14:17] gift of god
[1:14:18] it's tangible his peace is alive
[1:14:22] and it comes with his life
[1:14:25] the amplified version says about this
[1:14:28] last phrase
[1:14:30] it says i have deprived it
[1:14:33] king james says i have overcome
[1:14:36] the world
[1:14:37] the amplified says if you drop all the
[1:14:40] way down to the brackets at the bottom
[1:14:42] it says i have deprived it of power
[1:14:46] to harm you
[1:14:47] [Music]
[1:14:48] and have conquered it
[1:14:51] for
[1:14:53] you
[1:14:54] let's read that phrase again i have
[1:14:56] deprived it of power to harm you
[1:15:01] and have conquered it
[1:15:03] for you
[1:15:04] this is what jesus has done on our
[1:15:07] behalf if you believe that same man
[1:15:10] bow your head with me just a moment
[1:15:12] father
[1:15:13] i thank you for the holy reverence
[1:15:16] that's in this house right now
[1:15:19] i sense somehow in my heart that you are
[1:15:22] here today to speak to somebody
[1:15:25] and because i'm one of those who often
[1:15:27] needs to hear from you
[1:15:29] it delights me and it blesses me to know
[1:15:33] that you've come by this way with your
[1:15:35] presence
[1:15:36] because you have recognized a need
[1:15:40] the same as we read in the gospels he
[1:15:43] must needs go through samaria
[1:15:46] you sensed a need and you changed your
[1:15:50] program
[1:15:52] to fit and minister to that need i sense
[1:15:55] today lord that you have come by here
[1:15:58] because somebody has a need that needs
[1:16:01] to be ministered to
[1:16:04] i'm just a vessel all we have is the
[1:16:06] gifts that you've placed in our lives
[1:16:09] and the strength that we get
[1:16:12] as we press into you but you're the one
[1:16:15] who has the answer to every question
[1:16:18] you're the one who has the supply where
[1:16:21] there is a shortage
[1:16:23] you are the one that can deliver us from
[1:16:26] every power of the wicked one
[1:16:29] your name is to be exalted and your word
[1:16:33] is to be exalted even above your name
[1:16:36] and so lord i ask today that you will
[1:16:38] come for a few moments and anoint our
[1:16:41] ears
[1:16:42] to hear your word we're not looking for
[1:16:45] something new that we've never heard
[1:16:46] before we're looking for something that
[1:16:48] will speak directly to where we are
[1:16:51] and so we ask that you would come today
[1:16:54] we ask that your word and your presence
[1:16:57] would drive every demonic power out of
[1:17:00] this room in the name of the lord jesus
[1:17:02] christ
[1:17:04] i pray o god that you'll bring
[1:17:05] conviction to every heart that would sit
[1:17:08] down on your word
[1:17:10] for any reason
[1:17:12] even because of their own burdens and
[1:17:14] struggles because lord it's when we're
[1:17:18] in that place that we need your word
[1:17:20] more than we need it when things are
[1:17:22] going good it seems so come today and
[1:17:25] help us we pray it's in the mighty name
[1:17:28] of our messiah yeshua in the name of the
[1:17:31] lord jesus christ we pray and the saints
[1:17:33] said amen
[1:17:35] you may be seated this morning anointed
[1:17:37] to overcome anything
[1:17:40] this has been our theme for a few
[1:17:41] services now
[1:17:43] it started on the wednesday night of
[1:17:45] camp meeting and we've carried it over
[1:17:47] and i i think this is the fourth time
[1:17:50] that we're bringing the same subject
[1:17:52] and i had every intention this morning
[1:17:54] of moving on to something else
[1:17:56] i want to go back and finish up the
[1:17:58] seven offices of the holy spirit and
[1:18:00] there's some other things that are in my
[1:18:02] heart that i want us to talk about
[1:18:04] and we want to concentrate uh some on
[1:18:08] the end times the times that we're
[1:18:10] living in
[1:18:11] but i sense the spirit of god taking me
[1:18:14] back to this
[1:18:15] for somebody you see we never know who's
[1:18:18] going to be here
[1:18:19] we never know who's going to come by the
[1:18:21] stream i meant to mention
[1:18:23] a moment ago but didn't take the time to
[1:18:25] do that but we're receiving greetings
[1:18:27] now from all over the world god bless
[1:18:30] every one of you
[1:18:32] we're so thankful to have you joined
[1:18:34] with us and many are expressing their
[1:18:37] desire and wishes that they could be
[1:18:39] with us in person and when that is not
[1:18:41] possible we're glad for this technology
[1:18:44] we have no way of knowing who's going to
[1:18:46] fall on this stream
[1:18:48] we don't know who will see it in the
[1:18:50] archive
[1:18:51] i don't know how many maybe someone
[1:18:53] could get me a number i don't i think
[1:18:55] it's
[1:18:56] i don't know how many have downloaded
[1:18:58] the app but
[1:18:59] every day now people are downloading the
[1:19:01] app it's going all over the world
[1:19:04] every day people are connecting
[1:19:06] themselves to the different streams
[1:19:08] so that they can be notified when it's
[1:19:10] time
[1:19:11] asking about uh joining newsletters and
[1:19:14] so forth there seems to be a hunger
[1:19:17] that's being stirred
[1:19:19] and i sense that whether it's in this
[1:19:21] room or whether somebody will come by
[1:19:23] this
[1:19:24] at a later time i'm sensing that god
[1:19:27] wants to say to somebody today you can't
[1:19:30] do it by yourself
[1:19:32] but i've already done it on your behalf
[1:19:35] it's already a finished work
[1:19:37] i have overcome the world
[1:19:40] that world in the greek is cosmos and it
[1:19:44] means the order of existence
[1:19:47] it means everything that god has placed
[1:19:50] in his divine order in the earth so it
[1:19:53] means everything it means the world and
[1:19:56] it encompasses everything in the world
[1:19:59] all the people in the world all of the
[1:20:01] systems in the world the religious
[1:20:03] systems of the world it encompasses all
[1:20:06] of that when jesus said i have overcome
[1:20:08] the world he means just that there's
[1:20:11] nothing that i haven't already dealt
[1:20:13] with
[1:20:14] there's nothing that i haven't already
[1:20:16] risen to the top and overcome and i
[1:20:18] didn't do it because i had a need of it
[1:20:21] in myself but i did it because i knew
[1:20:23] there would be a people that would need
[1:20:26] that strength
[1:20:27] they would need that overcoming
[1:20:29] anointing they would need that power to
[1:20:32] overcome people are being overwhelmed
[1:20:35] all around us
[1:20:37] and fear you think that by now fear
[1:20:40] would be would be sort of diminishing
[1:20:43] but i want you to know what i have
[1:20:45] experienced when i'm in the public is
[1:20:47] that fear seems to be rising instead of
[1:20:50] diminishing
[1:20:52] and uh the tactics that the enemy uses
[1:20:55] to arrest people in fear they get
[1:20:58] slimier and slimier as the days go by
[1:21:02] the pressure that's being put on people
[1:21:04] and the guilt that's being put on people
[1:21:07] who have a backbone and who desire to
[1:21:10] swim against the current it's becoming
[1:21:12] evil isn't it and yet in the midst of
[1:21:15] all of that there is a pandemic that's
[1:21:19] greater than any kind of virus there's a
[1:21:22] pandemic of sin there's a pandemic of
[1:21:25] unrighteousness there's a pandemic of
[1:21:28] those who have forgotten god we live in
[1:21:30] a nation that's forgotten her roots
[1:21:33] she's forgotten where she come from we
[1:21:35] live in families that have backslid away
[1:21:38] from things that they have known to be
[1:21:40] right and the slippery slope is getting
[1:21:43] seemingly more slippery as the days go
[1:21:46] by it would be easy to question some of
[1:21:49] the things that we have held on through
[1:21:51] the years except that there's a holy
[1:21:53] ghost on the inside of the believer that
[1:21:56] says don't you turn loose of it now
[1:21:58] you've never needed the truth like you
[1:22:00] need it now you've never needed the
[1:22:02] power of god like you need it now so
[1:22:05] whatever you do don't turn loose of him
[1:22:08] because he's the only way out of here
[1:22:10] he's the only way through here he's the
[1:22:12] only way we can make it if you believe
[1:22:14] that same man so jesus is saying i have
[1:22:17] deprived this world of all of its power
[1:22:21] to harm you and i have conquered it for
[1:22:26] you on your behalf so you don't have to
[1:22:29] have a fear as a holy ghost believer you
[1:22:32] don't have to have a fear of the world
[1:22:34] being able to overcome you you've just
[1:22:36] got to stay in christ
[1:22:38] you've got to keep creating an
[1:22:40] atmosphere of worship and his presence
[1:22:43] comes in to that kind of an atmosphere
[1:22:46] we just keep cultivating that and
[1:22:48] feeding that and making him our priority
[1:22:52] and then he releases to us the anointing
[1:22:54] that we need to overcome anything
[1:22:58] and everything
[1:23:01] i recently encountered a woman whose
[1:23:03] arms and legs were scarred
[1:23:08] i don't mean
[1:23:09] just a few little
[1:23:11] scars i mean
[1:23:14] layer upon layer upon layer of scars
[1:23:18] on her forearms and her ankles because
[1:23:21] she spent most of her life harming
[1:23:23] herself
[1:23:26] she had gotten so addicted
[1:23:29] to not only the the thrill the the
[1:23:32] release
[1:23:34] of brain chemicals that happen
[1:23:37] when they're driven by that kind of a
[1:23:40] spirit
[1:23:41] and it becomes a
[1:23:43] something that you can get addicted to
[1:23:45] like a thrill seeker
[1:23:47] are you in me
[1:23:48] and they get addicted to the feeling
[1:23:50] that the brain
[1:23:51] uh releases when it releases those
[1:23:54] uh endorphins and chemicals and so forth
[1:23:58] she not only became addicted to that
[1:24:00] kind of a rush to that kind of a feeling
[1:24:03] but she began to be addicted to pain
[1:24:07] and so she didn't just do it for the
[1:24:09] superficial
[1:24:11] blooding i i know it's bleeding
[1:24:14] she didn't just do it for the
[1:24:15] superficial of of seeing the blood and
[1:24:18] getting some kind of thrill but she
[1:24:20] began to be addicted to the pain
[1:24:22] and one day the thought came to her i
[1:24:25] wonder what would happen if i could see
[1:24:26] the bone
[1:24:29] and so she began to continue to cut and
[1:24:33] to dig into her flesh until she could
[1:24:36] see the bone
[1:24:39] now you can imagine that her life is a
[1:24:41] miracle
[1:24:42] the very fact that she's still alive is
[1:24:44] a miracle because many many many times
[1:24:47] she learned
[1:24:48] to to nurse herself so that she didn't
[1:24:51] have to go to the doctor so that she
[1:24:53] didn't have to to be treated in a
[1:24:56] medical condition and when she was asked
[1:24:59] about
[1:25:00] this kind of a of a problem she tried to
[1:25:03] hide it the best way she could she wore
[1:25:06] a long sleeve she wore uh trousers she
[1:25:10] she did everything she could to hide it
[1:25:12] she didn't even want her children to
[1:25:14] really know that they'd been such a big
[1:25:16] part of her life but there was there
[1:25:18] came a time that she couldn't hide her
[1:25:20] secret anymore because she had a small
[1:25:23] child that she walked in on and found
[1:25:26] him doing the very same thing that she
[1:25:28] had done she had never showed him she
[1:25:31] had it had never been talked about in
[1:25:33] the family but the same spirit that had
[1:25:36] nearly destroyed that woman's life was
[1:25:38] now after the next generation are you
[1:25:41] hearing me
[1:25:42] and you say well
[1:25:44] are you trying to say that jesus has
[1:25:46] overcome that he has
[1:25:49] he has
[1:25:51] he has overcome everything and anything
[1:25:53] that this world can offer there's not an
[1:25:56] addiction that he didn't win the victory
[1:25:58] for already
[1:25:59] come on now
[1:26:01] that doesn't just mean substance it can
[1:26:03] mean sexuality it can be all kinds of
[1:26:06] things
[1:26:07] people can even get addicted to putting
[1:26:09] holes in their body
[1:26:11] it's the same kind of spirit
[1:26:15] don't get quiet on me now
[1:26:17] it's the same kind of spirit it's a
[1:26:20] symbol of slavery to a system that wants
[1:26:23] to destroy lives but i want to tell you
[1:26:25] something greater is he that's in this
[1:26:28] little bride greater is he that's in the
[1:26:30] life of the believer than he that is out
[1:26:32] there in the world and if the enemy is
[1:26:34] trying to take you under or take you
[1:26:36] down with anything i said with anything
[1:26:40] i'm here to tell you today that when
[1:26:42] jesus overcame death hell in the grave
[1:26:45] he overcame it for you when he paid the
[1:26:48] price for deliverance he paid it for you
[1:26:51] and all you have to do is enter into
[1:26:53] fellowship with him
[1:26:55] he has overcome
[1:26:57] i'm telling you there's no chance this
[1:26:58] is going to get a little sticky for for
[1:27:00] those who are still a part of church
[1:27:02] entity you may get a little stuck here i
[1:27:05] hope not but i want you to know there's
[1:27:07] absolutely no chance of me being
[1:27:09] overcome by the enemy
[1:27:13] somebody said you ought not to boast you
[1:27:15] want not to brag you are not listen
[1:27:17] folks here's what it is i learned a long
[1:27:20] time ago i can't do this anyway
[1:27:24] so if you talk about failure i've done
[1:27:26] it i'm a failure
[1:27:27] if you talk about giving up i've done it
[1:27:30] [Music]
[1:27:31] you talk about letting people down i've
[1:27:33] done it
[1:27:34] you talk about not being there when they
[1:27:36] i've done all of that and guess what i'm
[1:27:38] still standing
[1:27:40] and it's not because i've done anything
[1:27:42] it's not because i'm good at all it's
[1:27:45] only because i'm trusting in the
[1:27:47] finished work of the lord jesus christ
[1:27:50] it's only because he paid a prize on my
[1:27:53] behalf
[1:27:54] the prophet of god told us in this
[1:27:56] generation he said and that bride she
[1:27:58] cannot fall
[1:28:01] he said that doesn't mean that she won't
[1:28:03] backslide
[1:28:04] now you know the church out there
[1:28:06] teaches that if you're backslid you're
[1:28:08] lost
[1:28:09] but that's not what the gospel teaches
[1:28:11] the bible teaches that fellowship is
[1:28:13] broken
[1:28:14] but relationship never changes
[1:28:17] if you were a son of god if you are a
[1:28:19] son of god you always were a son of god
[1:28:23] and that's not calvinism that's god's
[1:28:25] election by foreknowledge he knew you
[1:28:29] before the foundation of the world he
[1:28:31] knew your choice
[1:28:33] and by that choice he gave you a prefix
[1:28:35] destiny you may fail
[1:28:38] you may be a failure for a season
[1:28:41] you may slide back you may pick up no
[1:28:44] harm sins you may pick up harmful things
[1:28:49] you may have relapses
[1:28:53] what else do they call it
[1:28:55] relapses and
[1:28:57] fell off the wagons and
[1:29:00] you may experience all kinds of
[1:29:02] hardships and trials but i want you to
[1:29:05] know the power of god that saved you in
[1:29:07] the beginning
[1:29:08] the power of god that rescued you before
[1:29:11] the worlds were framed is ever more
[1:29:13] alive it hasn't changed and he still has
[1:29:16] power to untangle the messes that we
[1:29:19] make
[1:29:20] and we have a tendency to make some
[1:29:22] pretty big messes sometimes are you with
[1:29:24] me
[1:29:25] all right i appreciate that be of good
[1:29:27] cheer i've overcome the world now i
[1:29:30] think it's important as i mentioned in
[1:29:32] my in my friday text
[1:29:34] i think it's important to mention that
[1:29:36] when jesus made this profession and he
[1:29:39] said i have overcome the world he had
[1:29:41] not yet been tempted
[1:29:43] he had not yet come to his place of of
[1:29:46] death he had not been
[1:29:48] beaten with a whip he had not been
[1:29:50] crucified he had not died on the cross
[1:29:53] he had not resurrected from the dead he
[1:29:56] had not ascended into heaven
[1:29:58] none of these things had happened in
[1:30:00] reality they had only happened in the
[1:30:02] mind of god
[1:30:04] jesus was about to face the darkest
[1:30:06] hours of his life
[1:30:09] he was about to look like a failure
[1:30:14] those who already mocked him those who
[1:30:16] already despised him they were about to
[1:30:18] have their fun with him
[1:30:20] and they were about to tell see there is
[1:30:24] he was once a leader he once drew the
[1:30:26] masses and now look at him he's just a
[1:30:29] tangled mess of sinew and blood
[1:30:32] he's been reduced from a king to worse
[1:30:35] than a piece of meat laying there in the
[1:30:37] street it looked to all of those who
[1:30:40] were looking on like he had failed but i
[1:30:42] want you to know he could not fail
[1:30:45] because before he ever went to calvary
[1:30:47] he'd already won the victory for you and
[1:30:51] i there was a lamb that was slain before
[1:30:56] the worlds were ever framed
[1:30:59] there was a lamb already bleeding
[1:31:02] before jesus was ever born in a manger
[1:31:05] there was already a lamb bleeding
[1:31:08] before he ever hung suspended between
[1:31:10] earth and glory the lamb was already
[1:31:13] bleeding brother the lamb was already
[1:31:15] bleeding and he was bleeding for you and
[1:31:18] me he was bleeding for those that he
[1:31:20] would call to salvation if you're saved
[1:31:23] today it's because you were called to it
[1:31:29] you're one in a million
[1:31:31] you may be a solitaire in your family
[1:31:34] you may be the only one in your house
[1:31:36] serving the lord
[1:31:38] you may have faced that at one time or
[1:31:40] another now it may not be so but you may
[1:31:43] have faced that at one time or another
[1:31:45] seem like everybody around you running
[1:31:47] in the other direction and you're
[1:31:49] running to christ
[1:31:50] seemed like everybody else was wanting
[1:31:52] to get high and do this and do that and
[1:31:54] do the other and you decided i want out
[1:31:56] of this
[1:31:57] i got to find a way out i can't get out
[1:31:59] by myself i got to find a way out and
[1:32:02] there you came to the lord and he saved
[1:32:04] you and delivered you and forgave you
[1:32:06] and set you free while everybody around
[1:32:08] you just kept going on the way they've
[1:32:10] been going
[1:32:13] the testimonies in this small crowd this
[1:32:15] morning would would marvel
[1:32:18] the minds of those who do not yet
[1:32:19] understand the power of the new birth
[1:32:22] [Music]
[1:32:24] you see i don't know at all i don't even
[1:32:26] like to know it all
[1:32:27] i'm a pretty nosy person but i don't
[1:32:30] need to know it all
[1:32:31] right i know enough about testimonies in
[1:32:34] this room to know that many of you were
[1:32:37] running with everything you had in the
[1:32:38] wrong direction and god arrested your
[1:32:41] path
[1:32:42] hallelujah
[1:32:44] i know there are people in this church
[1:32:46] who sow their bodies for sin
[1:32:49] i know there are people in this church
[1:32:51] who were addicted to drugs
[1:32:54] and addicted to alcohol
[1:32:57] i know people in this church that lived
[1:32:59] unnatural lives
[1:33:01] [Music]
[1:33:03] running as far as they could away from
[1:33:05] god and one day god was looking for them
[1:33:07] [Music]
[1:33:10] and he just started putting a hook out
[1:33:12] there and reeling you in
[1:33:14] somebody said i resent that you
[1:33:16] shouldn't resent that you should be
[1:33:19] thankful that you lost control you
[1:33:21] should be thankful that you surrendered
[1:33:23] your life to him and he brought you thus
[1:33:25] far and i'm telling you right now if he
[1:33:28] has kept you this far he'll be with you
[1:33:32] all the way to the end
[1:33:35] is faithful and he is true
[1:33:38] what do i have to do you have to keep
[1:33:40] saying yes
[1:33:42] not lip service
[1:33:45] but with obedience
[1:33:47] by laying down your life
[1:33:49] and obeying god's word
[1:33:52] if you're not baptized in the name of
[1:33:53] the lord jesus christ you don't have all
[1:33:56] you need
[1:33:56] [Music]
[1:33:58] hello
[1:34:00] that don't embarrass you does it
[1:34:01] am i embarrassing somebody by saying the
[1:34:04] truth
[1:34:05] if you're not baptized in the name of
[1:34:06] the lord jesus christ you don't have all
[1:34:08] the faith you need
[1:34:10] you haven't completed the steps of the
[1:34:12] new birth you need to follow him into
[1:34:14] the water take on his precious name if
[1:34:18] for no other reason to stand against a
[1:34:20] false religious system out there that
[1:34:22] encourages you to take on titles
[1:34:24] when the bible never said you're saved
[1:34:26] by titles he said there is a name that
[1:34:29] has been given
[1:34:31] whereby men may be saved
[1:34:33] not in titles
[1:34:35] but in a name and if you have not been
[1:34:36] sanctified by the washing of the water
[1:34:39] of the word if you've not found the
[1:34:41] strength to separate yourself from the
[1:34:44] pools of this world from the fads and
[1:34:46] the fashions of this world then you
[1:34:49] don't have all the faith you need you
[1:34:51] have not completed the steps of the new
[1:34:52] birth but he wants to wash you in his
[1:34:55] word he wants to anoint your yes
[1:34:59] anybody with me
[1:35:01] he wants to pour his anointing on your
[1:35:03] yes
[1:35:04] so that when the enemy tries to talk you
[1:35:06] out of it you just keep coming back and
[1:35:08] say no price is too big
[1:35:15] some little lady might come by and
[1:35:18] she might say you mean to tell me i
[1:35:21] i can't wear slacks
[1:35:25] you mean to tell me that i have to dress
[1:35:28] different and be different and and look
[1:35:31] different
[1:35:32] and sometimes
[1:35:34] we have a tendency to kind of sugarcoat
[1:35:36] and
[1:35:37] and say well you know the lord will take
[1:35:39] care of that he will
[1:35:41] he will it's not our place to try to
[1:35:43] clean the fish
[1:35:45] it's our place to catch the fish
[1:35:48] the word of god knows how to deal with
[1:35:50] people about their lives
[1:35:52] the greatest messages on holiness and
[1:35:54] separation are not the ones preached in
[1:35:56] the pulpit they're the ones preached in
[1:35:59] the pew the one preached at walmart the
[1:36:02] one preached at kroger
[1:36:05] when you walk in there like a little
[1:36:06] fish with a backbone sister swimming
[1:36:09] against the tide of humanity and saying
[1:36:12] i want to be modest unto the lord
[1:36:17] if i'm a married woman i'm reserving my
[1:36:19] body for my husband and i'm not going to
[1:36:21] hang it like a piece of meat on a hook
[1:36:24] and show it to the whole world anybody
[1:36:26] helping me
[1:36:28] the world is insane
[1:36:30] the world around us is being plunged
[1:36:33] into insanity and in the midst of this
[1:36:35] insanity as a backslid church system out
[1:36:38] there that can only promise you a
[1:36:40] doughnut and a cup of coffee but they're
[1:36:42] not offering much in the way of
[1:36:44] deliverance
[1:36:46] and they're not offering much in the way
[1:36:48] of truth
[1:36:49] you shall know the
[1:36:50] truth and the truth shall make you free
[1:36:54] it will set you free you will be
[1:36:55] recreated in truth that's a powerful
[1:36:58] transformation it's a powerful
[1:37:01] metamorphosis
[1:37:02] if you'd help me we might get somewhere
[1:37:06] that's just 101 isn't it this is
[1:37:08] christianity 101. but i feel the holy
[1:37:10] spirit reaching for something
[1:37:12] i feel him reaching for something
[1:37:15] if you don't know you don't know if
[1:37:16] you've never heard you've never heard
[1:37:19] there's a truth out there that it seemed
[1:37:21] to me like there's a truth that that
[1:37:23] needs to be lived
[1:37:25] and it needs to be proclaimed and it
[1:37:27] needs to be demonstrated without
[1:37:29] condemnation
[1:37:31] to punish someone because they sin
[1:37:35] i'm going to miss i'm going to mistreat
[1:37:37] somebody because they sin and they don't
[1:37:40] really know what they're doing or
[1:37:42] understand the consequences of what
[1:37:44] they're doing i'm going to leave that to
[1:37:45] god
[1:37:46] i'm going to let god i'm going to reach
[1:37:49] i'm going to believe
[1:37:53] i've been reaching
[1:37:56] i've been reaching for some
[1:37:58] i'm reaching for somebody this afternoon
[1:38:01] i'm reaching
[1:38:03] because i believe that there is hope
[1:38:06] for help i believe there is power for
[1:38:10] deliverance
[1:38:11] i believe that there is strength to get
[1:38:13] out of the mess and the muck and the
[1:38:16] mire and the cesspool that we're walking
[1:38:18] through in this life and be filled with
[1:38:21] the power of god filled with the holy
[1:38:23] ghost and fire
[1:38:25] so i say to anyone who has this problem
[1:38:27] with with having to give up some things
[1:38:29] or live a little different than the rest
[1:38:31] of the world i say to you
[1:38:33] that if you understood the value
[1:38:38] of eternal life
[1:38:40] if you understood the value of eternal
[1:38:44] life
[1:38:45] what a gift it is
[1:38:47] one you could never deserve
[1:38:50] one that i could never earn
[1:38:52] and yet he went all the way
[1:38:54] anybody helping me
[1:38:57] it's not a little louder
[1:38:58] you don't have to a man just not a
[1:39:00] little louder
[1:39:01] if you can't nod then wiggle your toe a
[1:39:04] little bit
[1:39:05] just pull with me just a second
[1:39:07] because i want you to know that too many
[1:39:10] people don't understand the value of a
[1:39:12] soul
[1:39:13] [Applause]
[1:39:14] what would you give in exchange for a
[1:39:16] soul you know 10 million worlds my
[1:39:19] little
[1:39:20] well she wasn't little but i loved her
[1:39:22] my granny
[1:39:24] she wasn't little i didn't call her
[1:39:26] little granny i called her big mama that
[1:39:28] was her name to me my aunt and my uncle
[1:39:31] they hated it they said i can't believe
[1:39:32] you call my mother big mama
[1:39:35] and i said well my papa's the one who
[1:39:37] give her that name
[1:39:39] and and so i can i'm having a hard time
[1:39:41] breaking it
[1:39:43] there was nothing little about her but
[1:39:44] she had a lot of power she had a lot of
[1:39:46] faith she had a lot of holy ghost
[1:39:49] and uh she used to say
[1:39:51] if 10 million worlds
[1:39:54] were laid at your feet
[1:39:56] 10
[1:39:57] million worlds
[1:40:00] and the value of 10 million worlds were
[1:40:04] laid at your feet it could never buy
[1:40:05] your soul
[1:40:11] your life
[1:40:14] so valuable in god's economy
[1:40:18] i i
[1:40:20] social media is so full today of people
[1:40:22] leaving here
[1:40:24] people passing
[1:40:26] it's not all coveted
[1:40:28] a lot of it is
[1:40:30] fear is taking people out
[1:40:33] come on now
[1:40:35] fear is taking people out
[1:40:37] but i see how families are being
[1:40:39] devastated there's a family there in in
[1:40:42] tennessee that lost a grandmother
[1:40:45] with the complications of a stroke and
[1:40:48] then a daughter this week also within a
[1:40:50] few hours of one another passed away
[1:40:52] with covid
[1:40:53] and it seems like every day you look
[1:40:56] here's another person
[1:40:57] and sometimes people post they say so
[1:41:00] and so lost their battle with cancer i
[1:41:02] tell you that one really gets me
[1:41:05] it's it's it's not believer's language
[1:41:10] you know folks that's not believers
[1:41:12] language
[1:41:13] oh brother so and so lost his battle to
[1:41:15] cancer you know what i've been doing
[1:41:18] i've been commenting on there and i
[1:41:19] don't say anything else except we're
[1:41:21] praying for you he won
[1:41:25] he won
[1:41:26] he didn't lose he won
[1:41:29] because if you believe what we believe
[1:41:31] in what brother greeley said today
[1:41:32] there's not a cancer in the world
[1:41:34] there's not a heart attack in the world
[1:41:36] there's not a demon power in the world
[1:41:39] that can take you out of here until god
[1:41:41] releases you to go
[1:41:45] you want to take care of yourself you
[1:41:46] want to preserve yourself you want to do
[1:41:49] healthy things to help yourself
[1:41:51] because you don't want to be in a
[1:41:53] condition that you can't enjoy the
[1:41:55] quality of life but i want you to know
[1:41:57] your days were written in a book the
[1:41:59] bible said before you were ever born all
[1:42:02] of your days were already recorded in an
[1:42:05] eternal book and one of these days
[1:42:10] we lost a pastor in arkansas in the
[1:42:13] message this week to cancer i mean to
[1:42:15] covet
[1:42:16] that was what's put on his
[1:42:19] death certificate covet
[1:42:21] but i know and you know that it was time
[1:42:26] somebody said brother i wasn't ready to
[1:42:28] give him up and the church wasn't ready
[1:42:30] when were we ever ready
[1:42:32] when do we ever get ready to turn loose
[1:42:34] of something that we love but i will
[1:42:36] tell you one more time this morning i
[1:42:39] refuse to serve a god whose enemy that
[1:42:42] he created is more powerful than he is
[1:42:49] that's the theology of the church
[1:42:54] well the devil took him out
[1:42:56] i ought to have some help
[1:42:59] i'm going to hurry
[1:43:00] somebody ought to help me
[1:43:02] oh the devil took him out oh she lost
[1:43:04] her battle to breast cancer oh he lost
[1:43:06] his battle this he lost his battle oh my
[1:43:08] my my he won
[1:43:10] was he born again was his soul redeemed
[1:43:13] by the blood of the lamb hey he
[1:43:16] graduated out of this pest house and
[1:43:19] stepped into eternity and you and i are
[1:43:22] going to make that crossing one of these
[1:43:24] days and we better know that we know
[1:43:26] that we know that every sin is under the
[1:43:28] blood that we are not trusting in our
[1:43:31] works of holiness or righteousness but
[1:43:34] we are trusting in the blood of the lamb
[1:43:37] that has made full atonement
[1:43:40] hallelujah
[1:43:42] hallelujah
[1:43:43] be of good cheer i have overcome the
[1:43:45] world i have deprived it of power to
[1:43:47] harm you and have conquered it for you
[1:43:50] somebody say amen
[1:43:52] now jesus in matthew chapter four if
[1:43:54] you'll go with me there a moment i need
[1:43:56] to i need to close i guess already
[1:44:00] matthew chapter four
[1:44:02] these little visitors are saying yes yes
[1:44:04] please
[1:44:06] cara was that you
[1:44:08] uh lena was that you i'm just kidding
[1:44:11] i know i've been in services like that
[1:44:13] where i was ready i was tired you know
[1:44:15] or i was ready to go and the and the
[1:44:17] people were saying no preach on
[1:44:22] you may not be in that channel
[1:44:25] but if you get in that channel
[1:44:28] if you never find that place
[1:44:30] and get in that channel
[1:44:32] it'll never seem like eternity to you
[1:44:34] again
[1:44:36] it'll seem like the very food that you
[1:44:38] that you need to sustain you and
[1:44:39] strengthen you on the way wanting
[1:44:41] matthew chapter 4 verse 8
[1:44:44] again the devil taketh them up into an
[1:44:46] exceeding high mountain and showeth him
[1:44:49] all the kingdoms of the world and the
[1:44:51] glory of them my there must have been a
[1:44:53] lot of value in those kingdoms
[1:44:55] there must have been a lot of glory in
[1:44:57] those in those kingdoms in verse 9 and
[1:45:00] saith unto him all these things you know
[1:45:02] this is a paradox
[1:45:06] this is satan a squatter
[1:45:09] he has no rights
[1:45:12] only thing he has is what was given to
[1:45:13] him
[1:45:16] brother branham tells us that the only
[1:45:18] power the enemy has against you is what
[1:45:20] you give him
[1:45:24] you know that i tell you that ought to
[1:45:26] open somebody's eyes
[1:45:28] but instead the religious mind says oh i
[1:45:30] don't think it could be that way it is
[1:45:32] that way
[1:45:33] his power is broken
[1:45:36] somebody said when you look around in
[1:45:37] the world it sure don't look like that
[1:45:38] that's because people are giving him the
[1:45:40] power
[1:45:41] he's just a squatter he's here on
[1:45:43] squatter's rights
[1:45:44] this earth doesn't belong to him he's
[1:45:46] temporarily been given authority as a
[1:45:48] prince of the power of the air he rules
[1:45:50] in the second heaven
[1:45:52] the only time he can work in this in
[1:45:54] this dimension is when we give him
[1:45:56] permission when we open a door when we
[1:45:59] allow him to
[1:46:02] and he doesn't have to fight fight his
[1:46:03] way in because we're all the time just
[1:46:05] yielding something to it you know it's
[1:46:07] the truth
[1:46:08] you're shielding to him but i find this
[1:46:10] to be such a paradox here is a squatter
[1:46:12] he don't have anything he doesn't own
[1:46:14] the kingdoms of this world
[1:46:16] he don't own the beauty of this world he
[1:46:19] doesn't own the value that's represented
[1:46:21] in these kingdoms here or the glory
[1:46:23] that's represented in them and yet he's
[1:46:24] got jesus god in the flesh
[1:46:29] fasting out there in the wilderness and
[1:46:30] here comes the enemy
[1:46:32] and he is offering him what already
[1:46:34] belongs to him
[1:46:36] who do you think has the bible said the
[1:46:39] earth is the lord's and the fullness
[1:46:42] thereof
[1:46:43] at any time jesus could have taken his
[1:46:46] authority over all the kingdoms and the
[1:46:49] glory of the whole earth
[1:46:51] but he just allowed the enemy that old
[1:46:52] squatter to offer him what already
[1:46:54] belonged to him if thou wilt fall that
[1:46:57] uh oh
[1:46:58] this ain't never going to happen
[1:47:00] if thou will fall down and worship me
[1:47:04] verse 10 then saith jesus unto him get
[1:47:06] thee hints
[1:47:07] satan
[1:47:08] for it is written thou shalt worship the
[1:47:12] lord thy god
[1:47:14] and him only
[1:47:16] shalt thou serve
[1:47:18] this is only one of the of the series of
[1:47:20] temptations
[1:47:22] that jesus went through the bible said
[1:47:24] in all men are tempted as we are yet
[1:47:27] without sin
[1:47:28] then what was the purpose of all that
[1:47:30] temptation
[1:47:35] i was the purpose
[1:47:38] you were the purpose
[1:47:40] we had to have a high priest
[1:47:42] that could be touched with the feeling
[1:47:44] of our infirmities
[1:47:46] we had to have a high priest who
[1:47:48] understood what it was like to live in a
[1:47:50] body of flesh though we were god in
[1:47:53] spirit he was flesh
[1:47:55] and he felt the pools of a fleshly soul
[1:47:59] the bible tells us so
[1:48:01] i want to i want to share a few
[1:48:03] quotations with you from the message of
[1:48:05] the hour in a message called and thy
[1:48:07] seed shall possess the gate of his enemy
[1:48:11] for those of you who don't know i'm
[1:48:13] quoting now from a man sent from god his
[1:48:18] name was brother william branham he was
[1:48:20] a prophet sent to
[1:48:22] the earth
[1:48:23] and we believe in prophets
[1:48:26] we believe in fivefold prophets
[1:48:28] and we believe that they're human
[1:48:31] and uh brother branham was a man and he
[1:48:34] he said i make mistakes and but he was a
[1:48:36] vessel that god used
[1:48:39] and i don't worship brother branham
[1:48:41] but i sure do appreciate the ministry
[1:48:44] i can tell you that when i found the
[1:48:46] ministry in the 80s i was walking in a
[1:48:49] whole lot more confusion than i knew
[1:48:52] i thought i'd just about come to know it
[1:48:54] all
[1:48:55] in fact i was in so much confusion that
[1:48:57] i didn't even know what the godhead
[1:48:58] looked like
[1:49:01] i didn't even have the right baptism
[1:49:04] come on
[1:49:05] but god used this man so i just wanted
[1:49:08] to because there may be some of you that
[1:49:09] don't know why in the world they're
[1:49:10] quoting for that man if you go to the
[1:49:12] lutheran church you might hear something
[1:49:14] from luther if you go the baptist church
[1:49:16] if they're conservative baptists they
[1:49:18] might quote from rice or or some of
[1:49:20] their great uh
[1:49:22] you know generals or or whatever you go
[1:49:24] to the wesleyan or methodist church you
[1:49:26] may hear something great from charles
[1:49:28] wesley or or john wesley
[1:49:30] and so don't be put off by this in fact
[1:49:33] uh
[1:49:34] you you you might be able to relate to
[1:49:37] it because
[1:49:38] he only had a small education
[1:49:42] he didn't he didn't know much about what
[1:49:44] devil double negatives were or having
[1:49:47] the right sense the right uh the the
[1:49:49] right uh uh predicate that goes with the
[1:49:52] right subject that and putting the where
[1:49:54] the adverb goes and
[1:49:56] uh you can tell i don't know too much
[1:49:58] about either ah
[1:49:59] i'm trying to try and i wanted to sound
[1:50:01] i wanted to sound like i knew what i was
[1:50:02] talking about i need sister joy i i
[1:50:04] could listen i could get my text out
[1:50:07] because she just sent me one recently i
[1:50:09] hope she don't mind uh she just sent me
[1:50:12] one recently and and i'll read one thing
[1:50:14] she said how about that yes we'd love to
[1:50:17] i'm not looking at her to see if she
[1:50:18] allows me to or not
[1:50:20] uh
[1:50:22] let me go back let me go back real quick
[1:50:23] real quick real quick real quick
[1:50:25] hallelujah i might not can find it
[1:50:29] oh i better don't read some of these
[1:50:33] i'm
[1:50:36] kidding you she didn't get nervous why
[1:50:39] did you
[1:50:41] i can't even find it i had sent her a
[1:50:43] quote
[1:50:45] hallelujah
[1:50:49] you know what it might not all be on
[1:50:50] here though
[1:50:51] yeah no mate is hallelujah praise the
[1:50:54] lord
[1:50:55] can't find it
[1:50:56] can you remember what you said about it
[1:50:58] was a quo it was this quote it was the
[1:51:00] quote the quote that i sent out friday
[1:51:02] and you said about how brother branham
[1:51:04] said
[1:51:05] he had it right
[1:51:06] in in the in the tents he over
[1:51:12] instead of
[1:51:14] oh yeah he said it was he
[1:51:17] and most of us would say it was him
[1:51:21] and when we read it it was he it sounds
[1:51:23] wrong
[1:51:25] but sister joyce was saying uh being the
[1:51:28] the grammar police that she is
[1:51:30] she was saying that was the right way to
[1:51:32] say it
[1:51:33] which just tickled me real good i know
[1:51:35] that's not a very manly word but it
[1:51:38] tickled me real good
[1:51:39] because i thought even in that little
[1:51:41] education that he had he was more
[1:51:43] correct in his english than i am mine
[1:51:47] people make fun of his grammar and mine
[1:51:49] is actually worse than his so you're
[1:51:51] probably making fun of me too
[1:51:53] so enough said and thy seed shall
[1:51:55] possess the gate of his enemy paragraph
[1:51:57] 77 jesus
[1:51:59] as soon as he received the fullness of
[1:52:02] the spirit on the river
[1:52:04] when john baptized him
[1:52:06] immediately the devil took him into the
[1:52:09] wilderness to go through a time of
[1:52:12] temptation
[1:52:14] but when he took the word of god and
[1:52:17] overcome the devil it is written it is
[1:52:21] written he came back out then ready for
[1:52:26] his ministry
[1:52:28] he was driven by the power of god in and
[1:52:31] out of the wilderness
[1:52:34] now let me share you with you the next
[1:52:36] one it's in a message show us the father
[1:52:39] and it suffices i like this one you you
[1:52:42] know this one i've shared it with you
[1:52:44] before jesus had all the fine qualities
[1:52:48] of god in him
[1:52:51] we could say all the attributes
[1:52:53] do you believe it he said he had powers
[1:52:56] upon powers but when he met satan
[1:53:01] he never used his
[1:53:04] power
[1:53:07] he gave an example for the weakest of
[1:53:10] christians
[1:53:12] have you ever felt powerless against the
[1:53:14] enemy
[1:53:16] jesus was showing you there is a way out
[1:53:20] of your situation even when you feel
[1:53:22] powerless
[1:53:24] even when you feel weak and without
[1:53:27] strength there is a way out of your
[1:53:30] problem out of your situation and that
[1:53:32] is by the word of god
[1:53:34] he said he gave an example for the
[1:53:36] weakest of christians when he met satan
[1:53:38] he said it is
[1:53:40] written
[1:53:42] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:53:45] every word that proceeds out of the
[1:53:47] mouth of god though listen
[1:53:52] i know in this church of super
[1:53:54] christians
[1:53:56] there are no weak ones here
[1:54:00] but i'm going to say this so that if you
[1:54:02] ever get weak or feel weak you'll know
[1:54:05] that even my god
[1:54:07] whoa
[1:54:12] lord i don't want to get beside myself
[1:54:16] hallelujah
[1:54:17] the weakest christian can take that
[1:54:21] stand
[1:54:24] hold it
[1:54:25] sure god's in his word
[1:54:30] when you are powerless the word is
[1:54:34] powerful
[1:54:35] when you are weak the word is strong
[1:54:39] he said god always uses his word to
[1:54:43] defeat his enemy
[1:54:45] you and i must defeat our enemy the same
[1:54:48] way jesus defeated his enemy
[1:54:52] by the word
[1:54:53] you can't use what you don't know
[1:54:55] you can't use what you don't have
[1:54:58] you've got to get it in you
[1:55:01] you've got to get the word of god in you
[1:55:04] remember we've said since i was a child
[1:55:07] it's not how much of the word of god you
[1:55:09] go through
[1:55:11] it's how much of god's word goes through
[1:55:13] you
[1:55:15] it's what you receive and allow the holy
[1:55:18] spirit to anoint
[1:55:20] and then you use and utilize
[1:55:24] and take up the power and take up the
[1:55:26] authority take up the strength
[1:55:29] that's provided for us by the word
[1:55:32] the weakest christian can take that
[1:55:34] stand hold it sure god's in his word
[1:55:36] every time when he would meet the enemy
[1:55:39] he said it is written
[1:55:41] i want to hear you say it is written
[1:55:46] what if i don't have the power to serve
[1:55:48] the lord
[1:55:49] it is written
[1:55:54] what if my pain increases it
[1:55:57] is
[1:55:58] written
[1:56:00] what if the enemy tells me to harm
[1:56:02] myself it
[1:56:04] is
[1:56:05] written
[1:56:08] when you mention something as fatal
[1:56:11] and final as suicide
[1:56:15] people will marvel sometime
[1:56:20] they'll say oh my
[1:56:22] there's so many
[1:56:24] who take their lives
[1:56:27] i don't know what the statistics are but
[1:56:29] i have to give you the other side of the
[1:56:31] coin
[1:56:34] there are so many more
[1:56:37] that win the victory
[1:56:41] against that enemy
[1:56:44] that wants to take them out
[1:56:46] there are people sitting in this room
[1:56:48] right now that had to overcome that
[1:56:50] enemy years ago or they wouldn't be
[1:56:53] alive today to shout the praises of god
[1:56:58] so if they get a little loud or they
[1:56:59] wave their flag at you or they are they
[1:57:02] worship in a way that you don't worship
[1:57:04] just hold your peace
[1:57:05] and remember that you don't know like
[1:57:08] they know
[1:57:09] you don't know like they know
[1:57:12] what the lord has done for them
[1:57:16] you may not know the depth of their
[1:57:18] testimony
[1:57:20] but there are people in this room that
[1:57:22] took up the pistol
[1:57:26] there are people in this room that took
[1:57:28] up the bottle of pills
[1:57:30] because they wanted to end it all
[1:57:33] and you don't hear the glorious reports
[1:57:36] of what the power of god can do in a
[1:57:38] situation like that
[1:57:41] this prophet that i mentioned just a few
[1:57:43] moments ago god gave him a ministry and
[1:57:47] the enemy tried to take that ministry
[1:57:49] out
[1:57:50] because when he refused to obey the lord
[1:57:54] and go to the pentecostals
[1:57:56] because he was a baptist
[1:57:58] and his mother-in-law was a baptist and
[1:58:01] his mother-in-law didn't want her
[1:58:03] son-in-law dragging her daughter down
[1:58:06] there with those trash holy rollers
[1:58:12] you see i remember when the assemblies
[1:58:13] of god churches weren't big cathedrals
[1:58:15] on the hill
[1:58:17] i remember when the pentecostal churches
[1:58:19] were on the wrong side of the tracks and
[1:58:20] i'm not that old
[1:58:22] but i remember when they were on the
[1:58:24] wrong side of the track and when when
[1:58:26] you said pentecostal they looked down on
[1:58:28] you
[1:58:31] and this mother-in-law mrs brumback she
[1:58:33] didn't want her daughter to be drugged
[1:58:34] down into that pentecost so he just put
[1:58:37] off the invitations and didn't go
[1:58:39] and god had a way of getting his
[1:58:41] attention
[1:58:42] and god loves you just like he loved
[1:58:44] brother branham and he has a way of
[1:58:46] getting your attention
[1:58:47] and talking to somebody he has a way of
[1:58:49] getting your attention
[1:58:51] and he brought a flood to that whole
[1:58:53] ohio valley region
[1:58:55] the ohio river flooded its banks
[1:58:58] and i want you to know it took out many
[1:59:01] many many lives
[1:59:03] not just drowning but tuberculosis
[1:59:06] was running rampant at that time and
[1:59:09] that cold damp environment of the
[1:59:12] flooded whole area of jeffersonville in
[1:59:15] louisville kentucky all that area
[1:59:17] underwater that cold damp environment
[1:59:20] just fed that lung condition
[1:59:23] and brother branham lost his wife sister
[1:59:26] hope
[1:59:27] and lost his precious little baby girl
[1:59:31] sharon rose
[1:59:34] and it was more than he could take
[1:59:37] when he realized that it was his own
[1:59:40] disobedience
[1:59:43] that caused god's voice to be that loud
[1:59:45] in his life
[1:59:47] somebody in here saying right now i
[1:59:49] don't believe god would do something
[1:59:51] like that then you don't know the god of
[1:59:52] the bible
[1:59:53] i don't know what god you know but you
[1:59:55] don't know the god of the bible the god
[1:59:57] of the bible was jealous for the destiny
[1:59:59] of william branham
[2:00:02] the god of the bible is jealous for your
[2:00:04] destiny
[2:00:05] the god of the bible wants you to step
[2:00:08] into what god has called you for
[2:00:10] and he'll find you
[2:00:12] it's called sovereignty
[2:00:14] if you want to boil down the message
[2:00:16] that i believe here we go uh god is
[2:00:19] sovereign you are not
[2:00:25] god is sovereign i am not
[2:00:28] somebody said then we don't have any why
[2:00:30] would we even try because the greatest
[2:00:33] joy in all the world
[2:00:36] is to come into fellowship and
[2:00:37] cooperation with god's plan
[2:00:40] for your life
[2:00:43] you don't have to be casting out devils
[2:00:45] and raising the dead but when you know
[2:00:47] that you have surrendered your will to
[2:00:49] his will
[2:00:51] it's joy unspeakable and full of glory
[2:00:55] there's no greater feeling in all the
[2:00:57] world than to know when you lay your
[2:00:59] head on the pillow at night if something
[2:01:02] should happen to me and i don't wake up
[2:01:04] in the morning and they find me here i
[2:01:06] they would be no need for them to worry
[2:01:08] because i have no worry whatsoever i
[2:01:12] know exactly where i'm going
[2:01:15] you can't have that confidence if you
[2:01:17] still think you earn your salvation
[2:01:23] you can't have that kind of confidence
[2:01:25] because you'll never know that you're
[2:01:26] earning it enough you'll never know that
[2:01:28] you're paying a great enough price but
[2:01:30] when you come to the revelation that
[2:01:32] you're not earning anything you're
[2:01:34] coming into fellowship and cooperation
[2:01:36] with what jesus has done on your behalf
[2:01:39] and he gives you peace i give you peace
[2:01:41] in the world you're going to get
[2:01:43] tribulation he said but i give you peace
[2:01:46] because i have overcome the world
[2:01:52] every time when he would meet the enemy
[2:01:54] he said it is written i believe he had
[2:01:56] power to do it
[2:01:57] but he met satan on the same grounds
[2:02:01] with the same word
[2:02:03] that you can meet him with everyone
[2:02:06] it is written
[2:02:08] so you can't face the enemy in your
[2:02:10] power
[2:02:11] you may have a little you may not
[2:02:14] but you can meet the enemy any time
[2:02:17] every time
[2:02:18] all the time
[2:02:20] on the same grounds that jesus met the
[2:02:22] enemy on
[2:02:23] the word in you
[2:02:24] it is written
[2:02:26] is anybody here
[2:02:28] good i'll take a few more minutes then
[2:02:30] beginning to think you left
[2:02:32] in a message called how can i overcome
[2:02:36] paragraph 68
[2:02:39] he said no matter how good how bad
[2:02:44] whatever you're in the kingdom by by
[2:02:47] holy ghost baptism see
[2:02:49] that's the only way you overcome
[2:02:53] it's all that is under the shed blood is
[2:02:56] overcomers
[2:02:58] how many of you are under the shed blood
[2:02:59] of jesus christ put your hand up if you
[2:03:02] are
[2:03:03] i didn't mean to yell
[2:03:05] i yell all the time but i didn't mean to
[2:03:06] yell at you
[2:03:08] i just wanted you to be sure you know
[2:03:10] what you're talking about
[2:03:12] if you're under the shed blood then
[2:03:14] you're overcomers
[2:03:17] because you cannot overcome
[2:03:20] yourself
[2:03:21] it's he
[2:03:22] that overcome for you here's the here's
[2:03:25] the grammatically correct quote
[2:03:29] it's he
[2:03:30] that overcome
[2:03:32] for you
[2:03:35] and what is that next little phrase
[2:03:36] there it didn't say you're testing
[2:03:40] it didn't say you're stressing
[2:03:43] didn't say you're striving
[2:03:46] what did it say
[2:03:47] [Music]
[2:03:51] ma i don't have to preach
[2:03:53] just let the quotes preach
[2:03:57] if that doesn't preach to you i'm
[2:03:59] worried about you
[2:04:02] you're not overcoming by your power
[2:04:04] you're overcoming the same way he
[2:04:06] overcome by the word
[2:04:08] because you're underneath the shed blood
[2:04:11] so it's he that overcome for you
[2:04:14] you're resting
[2:04:17] this don't feel like rest
[2:04:21] feels like a battle all the time
[2:04:25] you know why because the prophet told us
[2:04:27] the greatest battle ever fought would be
[2:04:29] on the battlefield of the mind
[2:04:32] if you overcome the pressure of your
[2:04:35] mind you'll overcome every obstacle in
[2:04:37] your life if you'll bring every thought
[2:04:40] into subjection to the word of god if
[2:04:42] you'll wrestle every one of those
[2:04:44] exalted thoughts down pull them down
[2:04:47] punch them beneath the truth of god's
[2:04:50] word you'll overcome every time
[2:04:53] you'll overcome every time
[2:04:54] you'll overcome every time
[2:04:57] hallelujah
[2:05:00] how can i overcome same message
[2:05:01] paragraph 72 go hear the message
[2:05:04] go hear the message it's a wonderful
[2:05:06] wonderful sermon how can anything preach
[2:05:09] in 1963 be any good for today just go
[2:05:12] here for yourself
[2:05:14] go here for yourself because it's more
[2:05:15] it's more relevant to this generation
[2:05:17] than the one it was delivered to you see
[2:05:20] i don't believe this message because
[2:05:21] there were miracles
[2:05:23] many people were convinced that there
[2:05:25] was a truth here because they saw the
[2:05:26] miracles in the gifts that that's not
[2:05:28] why we're following it now that's not
[2:05:30] why we're resting in this truth now
[2:05:32] we're resting in it because it sits
[2:05:34] right on top of god's word
[2:05:36] in that same message he said the thing
[2:05:38] you have to overcome
[2:05:42] [Music]
[2:05:46] is yourself
[2:05:50] you're the worst enemy you got
[2:05:52] you're the biggest critic you got
[2:05:58] your shame
[2:06:00] your embarrassment your condemnation
[2:06:03] your guilt your fear
[2:06:06] you've got to overcome you
[2:06:09] the enemy will convince you that
[2:06:11] everybody else is condemning you when
[2:06:13] you're the only one that's got your
[2:06:14] trigger turned toward you you got the
[2:06:17] barrel turned on you everybody else is
[2:06:19] letting god have his way in your life
[2:06:21] but the enemy sometimes we have to do
[2:06:22] that sometimes we just have to take our
[2:06:24] hands off and say oh god
[2:06:26] you take care of my brother you take
[2:06:28] care of my sister you know how to help
[2:06:30] him get beyond this
[2:06:33] but the enemy if he can keep you to
[2:06:35] where you'll keep the barrel turned on
[2:06:36] yourself
[2:06:38] he can rest
[2:06:40] the enemy can rest
[2:06:42] he doesn't have to labor as long as
[2:06:43] we're laboring for him
[2:06:45] the thing you have to overcome is
[2:06:46] yourself your idea your thing
[2:06:50] and surrender yourself to him he
[2:06:52] overcome for you
[2:06:54] say that with me he overcome for you he
[2:06:56] knows the way
[2:06:58] i wonder i don't want to miss that last
[2:07:00] phrase
[2:07:01] he knows the way
[2:07:04] he knows the way
[2:07:08] can you trust a god that doesn't always
[2:07:11] give you the way
[2:07:13] can you trust a god that doesn't always
[2:07:15] hand you the map
[2:07:17] and tell you what the next five years
[2:07:19] are going to look like
[2:07:22] can you trust a god who doesn't always
[2:07:24] give you the answer when you want it
[2:07:29] if you can't you're gonna be in trouble
[2:07:34] you've got to be willing to go and he
[2:07:36] says go even if you don't know the way
[2:07:40] you'll say well now that doesn't make
[2:07:41] any sense how can i go if i don't know
[2:07:43] the way i'll tell you how
[2:07:45] you just put one step spiritually in
[2:07:48] front of the other
[2:07:49] and you let god reveal and unfold his
[2:07:52] plan to you one step at a time our
[2:07:56] intellectual mind doesn't like it like
[2:07:59] that
[2:08:00] our intellectual mind likes for god to
[2:08:03] say now step one
[2:08:07] although none of us are disorganized
[2:08:15] some of you are putting salt in the
[2:08:16] cookies and and and and
[2:08:19] sugar on the fried chicken
[2:08:23] you got things you your your kitchen
[2:08:26] your your cupboards looks like a tornado
[2:08:30] you can't find what you have
[2:08:33] our problem is not necessarily
[2:08:35] organization is we don't have enough
[2:08:36] room and you have to dig to the back of
[2:08:39] the pantry to find a can of something
[2:08:40] you need it almost gets easier just to
[2:08:42] buy another can
[2:08:46] don't act like we're so all so organized
[2:08:49] that we've got it all planned out you
[2:08:51] know most of us when we have a vacation
[2:08:53] i know there are some who who uh there
[2:08:56] are some charities in the world
[2:09:00] there are some sally dukes in the world
[2:09:03] who plan out every step what they're
[2:09:04] going to do next and what they're going
[2:09:06] to see and pre-arrange and pre-book and
[2:09:08] pre-pay
[2:09:11] and then they head off on vacation
[2:09:14] and i think that'd be wonderful but if
[2:09:15] that was the only vacation you got to
[2:09:17] take
[2:09:18] that would not be the most relaxing one
[2:09:21] if you had all of it planned before you
[2:09:24] got there what about a down day and i
[2:09:26] think they they're good to schedule a
[2:09:28] downtime or a down day you you how do
[2:09:30] you know how do you know
[2:09:34] how you're going to feel
[2:09:36] on the middle day of your vacation how
[2:09:38] do you know
[2:09:42] that you're going to want to go
[2:09:43] parasailing
[2:09:47] i know right now i'm not going to want
[2:09:48] to go parasailing
[2:09:52] you we lack things planned out ahead of
[2:09:55] time but we don't always succeed
[2:09:58] and we treat our own life that way
[2:10:00] sometimes we want god to just unfold the
[2:10:03] scroll
[2:10:05] just unroll the scroll and you're gonna
[2:10:08] on such and such a day october of you're
[2:10:10] gonna hit this spot and you're gonna
[2:10:12] step into that and this is going to come
[2:10:14] and everything and we love that but i
[2:10:17] want you to know it doesn't take any
[2:10:18] kind of faith
[2:10:19] [Music]
[2:10:20] if the script is already in your hand
[2:10:24] oh it doesn't take any faith to live for
[2:10:26] jesus but i want you to know we trust
[2:10:29] him even though we don't know five
[2:10:32] minutes into the future
[2:10:37] unless god would anoint our eyes and let
[2:10:39] us see in the spirit we don't know what
[2:10:41] we'll be doing five minutes from now
[2:10:44] but god looks he sees eternity there's
[2:10:46] nothing about you that he doesn't know
[2:10:49] some of you said i wished i knew who i
[2:10:50] was going to marry god knows
[2:10:56] you wait and get married for the right
[2:10:58] reason you'll get the right mate
[2:11:05] better get off of that one
[2:11:08] it's the truth though
[2:11:09] and i owe that i owe that to my children
[2:11:12] to teach that i owe that to your
[2:11:14] children to preach that from this pulpit
[2:11:17] if you get anxious you will miss the
[2:11:19] mind of god
[2:11:23] you know even christian young people are
[2:11:24] too superficial sometimes
[2:11:26] they're looking for the shape of the
[2:11:28] nose
[2:11:30] when they need to be looking for the
[2:11:31] character
[2:11:34] because you can you can love a man with
[2:11:36] a big nose
[2:11:39] some of you men better be glad
[2:11:43] you can love somebody with big ears
[2:11:48] but you don't want to be cornered in the
[2:11:49] house with a brawling woman
[2:11:54] or a dominating man
[2:11:58] there's a way to lead a family
[2:12:00] but it's not by stepping all over them
[2:12:04] it's by being an example let me tell you
[2:12:06] something you don't want to get in that
[2:12:08] kind of a mess
[2:12:10] i don't know how many i've talked to
[2:12:12] through the years and i asked them have
[2:12:14] you asked this have you asked that have
[2:12:16] you asked this have you ever thought to
[2:12:18] ask them that and they look like
[2:12:20] i didn't know i was supposed to didn't
[2:12:22] know i was allowed to
[2:12:31] if you're getting ready to say i do
[2:12:34] you better be willing and ready and in
[2:12:36] the right environment with the right
[2:12:38] with the right care a right supervision
[2:12:41] you better be willing to ask anything
[2:12:43] and everything that comes to your mind
[2:12:46] and if somebody's not willing to give
[2:12:48] you the right answer you better be
[2:12:49] careful
[2:12:50] because the enemy has a trap
[2:12:54] the enemy has a trap
[2:12:56] if you're just willing to wait on god
[2:12:59] and trust him
[2:13:01] he'll bring the right one your way
[2:13:05] listen if if a young girl has to paint
[2:13:07] her face or she has to uh tighten up her
[2:13:10] skirt or she has to do something like
[2:13:12] that to catch some young man's eye
[2:13:16] he's no prize
[2:13:19] he may be a punk but he's not a prize
[2:13:24] if he can't love you for who you are
[2:13:27] then he doesn't love you i'll tell you
[2:13:30] what's wrong i'll tell you what's wrong
[2:13:32] with this age i'll tell you what's wrong
[2:13:34] pornography
[2:13:37] has destroyed a generation
[2:13:42] pornography you say i'm not i'm not
[2:13:44] believing you're going to yes i am
[2:13:49] i'm going to say something plain so you
[2:13:51] better put your seat belt on
[2:13:53] some of you are saying oh we got
[2:13:54] visitors here yes i know that we always
[2:13:56] will
[2:13:59] but the truth is the truth
[2:14:02] you feed your life on that filth
[2:14:07] you let that rule you it will rule you
[2:14:09] it will dominate your life
[2:14:12] you will tell yourself a thousand times
[2:14:15] i'm not gonna go there again and you
[2:14:17] will every time
[2:14:20] because if you conceal and hide your sin
[2:14:24] it will continue to have power over you
[2:14:29] the only way to get deliverance is to
[2:14:31] find accountability
[2:14:33] and to find it quick
[2:14:35] there's a generation of people out there
[2:14:38] a generation of young men and young
[2:14:40] women who have given themselves to the
[2:14:42] filth of this world through pornography
[2:14:45] and then they get married and they can't
[2:14:47] be satisfied
[2:14:55] because everyday life is not a
[2:14:57] performance
[2:15:00] anybody with me
[2:15:03] everyday life is not costumes and
[2:15:05] paraphernalia
[2:15:07] come on now
[2:15:10] what we need to see is giving god every
[2:15:14] part of who we are
[2:15:17] and allowing him to use his word to
[2:15:20] cleanse to deliver to uproot to put the
[2:15:25] ax to the root of the tree until
[2:15:28] everything that's in us that is not of
[2:15:30] him is dealt with
[2:15:33] so that we can get out from under the
[2:15:35] guilt
[2:15:38] and we cannot be afraid to testify
[2:15:41] people are afraid to testify what god
[2:15:43] has done because they're afraid he'll
[2:15:45] take it back
[2:15:48] he's not going to take it back
[2:15:50] you may surrender it but he's not going
[2:15:52] to take it back
[2:15:55] if god gives you relief you ought to
[2:15:57] praise him
[2:15:59] if god gives you a momentary moment of
[2:16:02] of getting help and feeling better in
[2:16:04] your body you ought to give him prayer
[2:16:06] well i'm scared to say anything cause it
[2:16:08] may come back let me tell you something
[2:16:10] this isn't witchcraft
[2:16:14] this is war
[2:16:16] i got to get back to the my little
[2:16:18] little little christianette message here
[2:16:20] you know
[2:16:23] how can i overcome same message
[2:16:25] paragraph 103 and we're nearly done
[2:16:28] it's 112 for any clockwatchers that are
[2:16:31] embarrassed to look
[2:16:34] jesus told us how to do it
[2:16:37] 103 is the paragraph how can i overcome
[2:16:40] jesus told us how to do it he overcome
[2:16:44] means
[2:16:45] overcome means
[2:16:48] to stand the test
[2:16:53] how many of you believe you can face the
[2:16:55] test
[2:16:56] and stand the test
[2:16:58] once you understand who jesus is in you
[2:17:01] he said that's right like all the old
[2:17:02] saints did like jesus did amidst all of
[2:17:05] his enemies he stood the test everything
[2:17:08] he was tested against he stood it in the
[2:17:10] very face of sickness and him being
[2:17:12] messiah he healed them
[2:17:15] in the face of death he brought it back
[2:17:18] to life in the face of calvary his own
[2:17:20] death he defeated it by surrendering
[2:17:23] himself
[2:17:24] he defeated death by surrendering
[2:17:26] himself to death
[2:17:29] because as he surrendered to death he
[2:17:31] made way
[2:17:32] for resurrection
[2:17:34] he said why by the word said you destroy
[2:17:37] this temple and i'll raise it up in
[2:17:38] three days the word said so
[2:17:42] come on see
[2:17:45] and in the presence of death he defeated
[2:17:47] it he overcame death overcome death in
[2:17:49] the presence of hell he defeated hell
[2:17:51] and overcome hell yes in the presence of
[2:17:53] the grave he overcome the grave why all
[2:17:57] by the word and humility
[2:18:01] and this humility
[2:18:03] is what tells you i can't do this
[2:18:07] in my own power
[2:18:09] in my own strength by my own wit by my
[2:18:12] own good looks by my own smarts
[2:18:17] i am nothing without him
[2:18:20] the only way i can overcome is to let
[2:18:22] him overcome in me he said oh my there's
[2:18:24] the real man there's the one to make
[2:18:26] your example see he defeated everything
[2:18:29] overcome it
[2:18:31] are you with me
[2:18:32] good i've got another one i want to
[2:18:33] share paragraph 104
[2:18:36] or you're just reading to us now yes
[2:18:41] look
[2:18:42] temptation was for him
[2:18:45] you know that the bible said he was
[2:18:47] tempted
[2:18:49] i want you to hear me if you hadn't
[2:18:50] heard me yet
[2:18:51] he was tempted at all points like we are
[2:18:53] yet without sin
[2:18:55] he was tempted by drinking oh
[2:18:58] i love this quote
[2:19:03] it rattles the religious cage
[2:19:12] because we gloss over what the book says
[2:19:15] the bible said he was in every manner
[2:19:17] tempted as we are every manner
[2:19:20] all manner
[2:19:22] you know what i believe that means every
[2:19:23] and all
[2:19:25] i believe it means all i believe it
[2:19:26] means in any way that you and i can be
[2:19:28] tempted he was also tempted
[2:19:31] that's how he became the propitiation
[2:19:34] for our sins
[2:19:36] i love this
[2:19:39] because if you use the example i used a
[2:19:41] moment ago if anybody is tempted to cut
[2:19:44] themselves or harm themselves
[2:19:49] he was
[2:19:54] remember
[2:19:58] tempted to drink
[2:20:00] all
[2:20:04] you see the temptation is not the sin
[2:20:08] it's yielding
[2:20:10] it's not overcoming
[2:20:12] that's unbelief
[2:20:14] when you get delivered from a
[2:20:15] pentecostal mindset that tells you
[2:20:17] everything is sin
[2:20:19] [Music]
[2:20:20] and you come to understand that the only
[2:20:22] sin is unbelief
[2:20:24] and everything else we do we do as
[2:20:26] attributes of unbelief
[2:20:28] so if we could get the unbelief taken
[2:20:29] care of we could have deliverance over
[2:20:31] the drinking we could have deliverance
[2:20:33] over the caring what we could have
[2:20:34] delivered if we get the unbelief if we
[2:20:35] get the unbelief problem if we get the
[2:20:37] faith problem settled
[2:20:40] there's power to overcome by the word of
[2:20:42] god if we can get the unbelief problem
[2:20:44] set up i believe i believe i believe i
[2:20:48] believe you just tell it i believe
[2:20:52] i believe the way it's made i believe
[2:20:54] the way of escape is made
[2:20:57] he was tempted by drinking oh
[2:21:00] now i know why you got quiet
[2:21:03] you were reading ahead
[2:21:06] you don't want your jesus
[2:21:10] you don't want to think about your jesus
[2:21:14] as as being tempted by a lustful thought
[2:21:20] but he was
[2:21:23] that makes me want to run around this
[2:21:25] room and hoop and holler and jump and
[2:21:27] scream at the top of my lungs let's see
[2:21:29] how that would how the visitors would
[2:21:30] feel then
[2:21:33] whoa
[2:21:36] it makes me want to shout
[2:21:39] because it means that there's nothing
[2:21:42] that the enemy can use against me that
[2:21:46] jesus hasn't already won the victory for
[2:21:51] me
[2:21:58] granny do it granny knew it
[2:22:02] she'd say you can't keep the bird from
[2:22:04] flying over your head
[2:22:07] but you can keep him from building a
[2:22:08] nest in your hair
[2:22:10] [Applause]
[2:22:12] the thought can run right by you
[2:22:16] and you just wave at it
[2:22:18] and keep sending it on its way
[2:22:21] but if you click
[2:22:24] [Music]
[2:22:26] if you entertain it
[2:22:29] if you fellowship it at all
[2:22:33] why listen i've been told by people that
[2:22:35] when they get in that place that
[2:22:37] thoughts start coming in their mind
[2:22:39] against the church
[2:22:42] and they start yeah and they start these
[2:22:44] thoughts start running through and said
[2:22:46] well you know you're not the only one
[2:22:48] there's a bunch of hypocrites over there
[2:22:49] at the church anyhow
[2:22:54] and then they start blaming different
[2:22:56] ones
[2:22:57] this one won't speak to me and that one
[2:22:59] won't speak to me this won't do this and
[2:23:01] that one won't do that and
[2:23:03] i'm the target of everything and
[2:23:05] that's how people do
[2:23:08] that's not what you ought to be thinking
[2:23:09] when you're under the gun
[2:23:12] how wrong everybody around you is
[2:23:14] when you fall under the gun you better
[2:23:16] be thinking about how good jesus is
[2:23:19] and you better be thinking about i'm not
[2:23:21] going to let no hypocrite get between me
[2:23:22] and god
[2:23:24] i'm not going to let no preacher get
[2:23:25] between me and god i'm not going to let
[2:23:27] nobody that won't talk to me get between
[2:23:29] me and god
[2:23:31] i'm going to serve god anyway
[2:23:33] i'm going to get help now i'm going to
[2:23:36] wave goodbye at these thoughts i'm not
[2:23:37] going to give them a lodging place in my
[2:23:39] heart i'm not going to let the bird
[2:23:41] build a nest in my hair i'm going to
[2:23:43] send it on i'm going to answer it with
[2:23:45] it is written it is written it is
[2:23:47] written it is written i'm not a low down
[2:23:50] good-for-nothing sinner because a
[2:23:52] thought came to my mind jesus was
[2:23:54] tempted in all manner jesus was tempted
[2:23:57] in all manner jesus was tempted by
[2:23:59] drinking jesus was tempted by women
[2:24:02] whoo
[2:24:03] my my my my mom
[2:24:06] i just don't know why we have to read
[2:24:07] these quotes because i could never
[2:24:09] remember
[2:24:11] all of these things
[2:24:13] in churches that would be too proud to
[2:24:15] read them
[2:24:16] the preachers won't preach it anyway
[2:24:19] i grew up i was in the church
[2:24:22] six and seven times a week and i never
[2:24:24] heard anybody preach ever preach i heard
[2:24:27] holiness preached
[2:24:29] i preached it sinned heard it preached i
[2:24:31] heard them preach it was sin to drink
[2:24:33] coca-cola i heard them preach it with
[2:24:35] sin to drink coffee i heard them preach
[2:24:37] it with sin for a woman to wear a hat i
[2:24:40] heard them preach it was on and on and
[2:24:42] on and on and on and on they went but
[2:24:44] nobody ever preached to me when i was
[2:24:47] growing up that jesus was tempted in all
[2:24:49] manner as we are
[2:24:52] and yet he overcame
[2:24:54] if somebody could have just told me that
[2:24:57] i would have realized i'm not alone in
[2:24:59] this war
[2:25:01] my lord was tempted
[2:25:04] my lord was tempted and he overcame
[2:25:09] the musicians are coming
[2:25:19] he was a man
[2:25:22] and yet you couldn't put a mark on him
[2:25:27] you understand that don't you
[2:25:29] does anybody understand that
[2:25:31] he was not guilty of sin
[2:25:33] he didn't yield to the temptation he
[2:25:35] didn't entertain the temptation he sent
[2:25:37] it on its way
[2:25:39] but he had to go through that
[2:25:41] he had to experience that
[2:25:44] so that you and i could have confidence
[2:25:46] in his ability
[2:25:48] to help us get through the same and more
[2:25:51] he said overcome means to recognize the
[2:25:54] devil in every one of his tricks
[2:25:59] he said a lot of people say there's no
[2:26:00] devil it's just a thought don't you
[2:26:02] believe that there's a real devil he's
[2:26:04] just as real as you are or anybody a
[2:26:06] real devil and you must recognize him
[2:26:08] real and you must know he's the devil
[2:26:11] then the same time that you recognize
[2:26:13] him and know that he's the devil and
[2:26:15] he's against you
[2:26:18] then to overcome
[2:26:20] you must recognize
[2:26:23] that the god in you
[2:26:27] have you invited him in i'm closing
[2:26:31] have you invited him in
[2:26:34] how do i know he's living in me have you
[2:26:36] invited him in
[2:26:42] have you asked him
[2:26:43] to forgive you of unbelief
[2:26:47] have you asked him to forgive you for
[2:26:49] wrestling with him for control of your
[2:26:52] life
[2:26:54] he wants to hold the reins
[2:26:58] not because he wants to run you in the
[2:27:00] ground but because he wants to give you
[2:27:02] power to overcome in life
[2:27:05] but the struggle of power and the
[2:27:07] struggle of who's in charge will
[2:27:10] sometimes cause you to leave god out of
[2:27:12] the equation but i implore you
[2:27:15] invite jesus into your life not some
[2:27:17] just some little concept
[2:27:20] of naming the name of christ
[2:27:24] but a real born-again experience
[2:27:28] let him wash you in his blood
[2:27:32] let him cleanse you by his word let him
[2:27:35] fill you with the life of god by the
[2:27:38] baptism of the holy ghost
[2:27:41] then to overcome you must recognize that
[2:27:44] the god in you
[2:27:45] is greater and mightier than he is
[2:27:51] that the one that's in you has already
[2:27:55] overcome
[2:27:57] hymn
[2:27:59] praise his name
[2:28:01] let's finish this one
[2:28:03] and by his grace
[2:28:09] the old timers the old-timers used to
[2:28:12] tell us things like you very careful you
[2:28:14] ever be careful what you say
[2:28:17] you better be careful what you say let
[2:28:18] him that think they stand take heed less
[2:28:20] default yes i know the word i know it
[2:28:22] says that
[2:28:24] that's pride
[2:28:27] that's taking an arrogancy
[2:28:29] and thinking that you can defeat it on
[2:28:31] your own power that's what's wrong
[2:28:35] they'd say you better be careful how you
[2:28:36] say things like that you'll make the
[2:28:38] devil mad
[2:28:41] let me tell you something if you've
[2:28:42] never made him mad
[2:28:45] you need to wake up and take that saddle
[2:28:47] off your back
[2:28:51] cause he's he's riding you you ain't
[2:28:54] nothing but a horse in his in his corral
[2:28:57] he will ride you as long and as hard as
[2:29:00] he possibly can and for as long as he
[2:29:02] possibly can until you realize i don't
[2:29:04] have to be road
[2:29:06] i don't have to have him on my back all
[2:29:08] the time driving me to this and driving
[2:29:11] me to that and pushing me to this and
[2:29:13] pushing me to that by the grace of jesus
[2:29:15] christ you are more
[2:29:21] are you still here
[2:29:23] more than a match
[2:29:28] i heard it preach brother man when i was
[2:29:29] a boy you're no match for the devil
[2:29:34] you better be careful you're no match
[2:29:35] for the devil
[2:29:36] that's because the church has the
[2:29:38] concept like i said a moment ago that
[2:29:40] god made the enemy more strong
[2:29:47] than he
[2:29:48] you do know that he made that devil
[2:29:50] you do know that he made that devil
[2:29:52] don't you
[2:29:53] yes he did
[2:29:57] somebody said well he didn't he didn't
[2:29:59] make him to be evil he didn't make him
[2:30:01] to be wicked then where do you think it
[2:30:02] came from
[2:30:05] the prophet of god was very careful to
[2:30:07] tell us that satan is not a creator
[2:30:10] he does not have power to create he only
[2:30:13] has power to twist and pervert that
[2:30:15] which is already created
[2:30:17] [Music]
[2:30:19] so where does the bible tell us that
[2:30:21] evil comes from where does the bible
[2:30:22] tell us darkness comes from
[2:30:25] the bible said god created it
[2:30:28] for his
[2:30:30] purpose and somebody said well what in
[2:30:33] the world is that his purpose was to be
[2:30:35] a redeemer
[2:30:37] but he couldn't redeem that which was
[2:30:39] not lost
[2:30:42] this is a mastermind
[2:30:44] this is a god who is omnipotent and
[2:30:46] omniscient and omnipresent this is a god
[2:30:48] who knew from the beginning all the
[2:30:50] trials of our lives and he made a way of
[2:30:53] escape he made a salvation so secure and
[2:30:56] so real that we can enter into that and
[2:30:59] we can take it and let it be the theme
[2:31:01] of our life
[2:31:03] yeah you must recognize that god in you
[2:31:05] is greater than he is and that the one
[2:31:06] that's in you has already overcome him
[2:31:09] and by his grace you're more than a
[2:31:10] match for him amen there's real
[2:31:12] overcoming when you recognize
[2:31:16] he said you look back this is the last
[2:31:18] one
[2:31:20] for this morning i didn't get to job
[2:31:23] you look back and say i'm doing this and
[2:31:25] i'm doing that
[2:31:27] then you're defeated but there's no
[2:31:28] condemnation to them which are in christ
[2:31:30] jesus
[2:31:31] that walk not after the flesh but after
[2:31:33] the spirit then you realize that you've
[2:31:36] overcome
[2:31:37] and you know that he's a devil and you
[2:31:39] can't say i got a sickness i don't
[2:31:41] believe in the sickness oh yes it is a
[2:31:42] sickness you've got cancer you don't
[2:31:44] believe it's a cancer it is a cancer it
[2:31:45] is a cancer but remember
[2:31:53] you see brother branham
[2:31:55] he wasn't name it and claim it and blab
[2:31:57] it and grab it
[2:32:00] he had a lot of correction for the
[2:32:02] charismatics and they couldn't handle it
[2:32:08] because remember the whole faith
[2:32:09] movement a lot of it was telling us you
[2:32:11] know you can't say this you can't say
[2:32:13] that you can't so so people get confused
[2:32:18] and when they died with the disease the
[2:32:20] rest of the church would say they lost
[2:32:21] the faith
[2:32:24] i've been around a long time
[2:32:25] i've been in church all my life
[2:32:28] i heard it
[2:32:30] they ward and ward and ward for healing
[2:32:33] and ward for healing and fought for
[2:32:35] healing and then when the saint of god
[2:32:36] would go they'd say well they must have
[2:32:38] lost the faith i told them then and i
[2:32:40] tell you now we're not snake handlers
[2:32:43] [Music]
[2:32:44] that's what they used to say about the
[2:32:45] snake handlers
[2:32:47] they'd handle them successfully until
[2:32:48] one day they got bit and died and they'd
[2:32:50] say they lost the faith
[2:32:52] brother branham was not about you being
[2:32:54] in denial
[2:32:57] he wasn't about you
[2:32:59] not not saying what it is what it has
[2:33:02] been so afraid now i try to be
[2:33:04] careful i try not to name mine
[2:33:08] because of what it does to me
[2:33:10] every cell in your body responds to the
[2:33:14] vibration and the frequency of your
[2:33:17] voice
[2:33:18] [Applause]
[2:33:20] amen
[2:33:21] so i want to be careful what i speak
[2:33:23] over the cells of my body
[2:33:27] but if you get in a tongue tied moment
[2:33:29] and you were to say it's cancer
[2:33:33] nobody's going to come back to me and
[2:33:35] tell me later if the lord takes you home
[2:33:37] that that's why because you said it the
[2:33:39] wrong way you lost the faith you didn't
[2:33:42] you you somehow didn't claim it just
[2:33:44] right remember what the prophet taught
[2:33:45] us
[2:33:46] when he was talking to sister statscliff
[2:33:50] she said the baby died brother branham
[2:33:53] and if i would have had more faith
[2:33:56] my baby wouldn't have died
[2:33:59] brother random said oh sister sats cliff
[2:34:01] that's not the case
[2:34:03] god saw your faith
[2:34:06] it was because of your faith that he was
[2:34:08] allowed he felt like he could then work
[2:34:11] according to his will and his plan
[2:34:13] because he knew that you would not curse
[2:34:16] him
[2:34:18] he knew that you had faith and you were
[2:34:21] not going to turn loose to that faith
[2:34:23] even in the moment of your great sorrow
[2:34:25] and in your sorrow he was working
[2:34:27] something out on your behalf
[2:34:31] somebody said i don't believe that i do
[2:34:33] and i believe it enough for both of us
[2:34:38] we're not fishing in here
[2:34:41] my granddaddy used to tell me you're not
[2:34:42] catching any fish
[2:34:44] not very often because i always caught
[2:34:46] more than he did
[2:34:48] he see he would see to that
[2:34:50] but he would say this to me he said
[2:34:52] you're not you must not be holding your
[2:34:54] mouth right
[2:34:56] and when i was real little
[2:34:58] i start
[2:35:04] and my big mom and say ralph
[2:35:07] quit saying that to that baby
[2:35:10] you quit telling him that honey you
[2:35:13] don't have to twist your mouth up like
[2:35:14] that you just have to be patient
[2:35:18] and there i was sitting trying to get my
[2:35:20] lip just right
[2:35:21] i kept looking at him
[2:35:24] to see how he was holding his
[2:35:28] this is how we are sometimes as
[2:35:29] christians we think i gotta hold my
[2:35:31] mouth just right or i'll miss my miracle
[2:35:34] [Music]
[2:35:37] let me tell you something that's not a
[2:35:39] sovereign god
[2:35:42] you're going to call it what it is
[2:35:44] sometime
[2:35:45] sometime you're going to call it what it
[2:35:47] is sometime even though you try not to
[2:35:49] you're going to name it
[2:35:55] i gotta go gotta go we gotta go
[2:35:57] my my my
[2:35:59] let me finish this though
[2:36:01] he said i uh you i got a sickness and i
[2:36:03] i don't believe it's a sickness and oh
[2:36:05] yes it's a sickness you got a cancer you
[2:36:07] don't believe it's a cancer it is a
[2:36:08] cancer it is a cancer but remember
[2:36:10] greater is he that is in you than he
[2:36:14] that is in the world why don't you tell
[2:36:17] the devil today i don't care what you
[2:36:18] call it
[2:36:19] i don't care what his name is greater is
[2:36:22] he that is in me that he that's in that
[2:36:25] demon
[2:36:28] hallelujah
[2:36:30] he said you must you must realize that
[2:36:32] the holy spirit that's in you has
[2:36:34] already overcome this thing
[2:36:36] be it cancer be it migraine headaches be
[2:36:39] a depression whatever it is
[2:36:44] you must realize that the holy spirit
[2:36:46] that's in you has already overcome this
[2:36:47] thing and he's in you and you can
[2:36:49] overcome

[2:36:58] way the scripture's written

[2:46:06] relationships and things but
[2:46:08] i know how to show them the way to get
[2:46:10] to calvary and get the lord's help and
[2:46:13] i'm not saying they're not his i believe
[2:46:15] they're certainly god's children but i
[2:46:18] want us to pray over them because no
[2:46:20] matter how far they go
[2:46:22] how far they roam this family will
[2:46:24] always be a part of this group this
[2:46:26] church we love them very very much

[2:46:31] five years and i first time i've seen
[2:46:33] her in five years
[2:46:34] i hope it won't be five more years but i
[2:46:36] was wrestling up there i was wrestling
[2:46:38] up there
[2:46:39] and the thought kept coming well what
[2:46:41] what if it's a long time what it what if
[2:46:43] it didn't turn out and it's a long time
[2:46:45] before i see them again i don't want to
[2:46:47] miss my chance
[2:46:48] so that's why we're here reach your
[2:46:50] faith toward them right now lord i lay
[2:46:53] my hands on this young man and this
[2:46:54] young lady
[2:46:56] because we love her
[2:46:59] we're going to love him it's not hard
[2:47:03] it's just the way it works in the
[2:47:04] kingdom and in the family of god
[2:47:07] when you care for somebody you just take
[2:47:09] who they care for into your life
[2:47:12] and we're taking him into our life lord
[2:47:15] whether we have opportunity to see him
[2:47:17] again or not i don't know these things
[2:47:18] are in your hands
[2:47:20] but i'm asking you lord to make yourself
[2:47:23] real to them oh god
[2:47:27] i'm asking you to reveal your love to
[2:47:29] them lord in a way they've never known
[2:47:31] it before
[2:47:33] i'm asking you to watch over their lives
[2:47:38] oh god there's not a one of us in this
[2:47:40] room that hasn't made mistakes before
[2:47:42] you
[2:47:44] made poor decisions use poor judgment
[2:47:47] and you never quit loving us
[2:47:50] you drew us in with arms of compassion
[2:47:53] that we could not understand and you
[2:47:55] showed us a mercy
[2:47:58] that was so amazing that to this day
[2:48:01] words fail us
[2:48:03] when we try to describe what grace has
[2:48:06] accomplished in each of our lives
[2:48:09] so today lord as a family
[2:48:12] we just lay hands on them and we join
[2:48:14] our faith with them and we pray that
[2:48:17] your perfect plan and your perfect will
[2:48:20] will be done in their life for your
[2:48:23] glory
[2:48:25] we will never accept that the enemy
[2:48:28] could just drive them any way he would
