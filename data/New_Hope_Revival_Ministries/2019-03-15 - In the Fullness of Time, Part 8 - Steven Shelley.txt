feel someone who's pulling who's interested in hearing what the Lord is you to share so I'm believing that we will conclude our series today with episode 8 in the fullness of time we have been studying it now week after week we've covered a lot of scriptures and we've covered a lot of ground but our foundational scripture for the entire series is found in Galatians chapter 4 verses 1 through 7 and I'm not going to break tradition I'm gonna read it again now I say that the air as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the Father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because ye are sons God hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ I tell you that is a power-packed seven verses of scripture and we've covered them even the last time we were together we broke them down a little bit more using the original language of Greek when we were together the last time we emphasized three main points and that was that God was waiting for a particular time when the scene was set and everything was just right so that he could step into this world through a the Word of God made flesh we talked about how that there had never been a time since the beginning since the garden that the world was more prepared more ready to receive the Lord Jesus Christ than in the hour that he was born it was in that moment that time had come to its fullness we talked about that vessel remember that was being filled up all through the years as a new prophet would come on the scene with the word of the Lord as God would would move among his people in various ways and there would be various responses it seems that most of the Old Testament was God wooing and calling his people back to be faithful to the Covenant that he had made with them there's one thing we know about God and that is he is always faithful to his end of the Covenant but he continues to have to draw us and woe us and call us back into covenant with him until we understand what a privilege what a blessing it is to be included in God's covenant with mankind then we desire to walk humbly to walk in repentance and to walk in obedience before him so those three main areas that we can say that the world was prepared in number one the world was ready for him physically we covered that with the road system with the shipping routes everything in place so that when the gospel came it could then get out number two the world was ready for him religiously paganism idolatry was on every hand and religion the true faith that God had given to the Hebrew people even it had in greatly polluted the the character of the priesthood had been compromised and the various sects of Judaism like like the Pharisees and the Sadducees and a few others were all moving into their little interpretations which in most cases left the people either hopeless or bowed down by the weight of legalism and so I tell you the world needed a savior in that hour and then the other way that we can say that the world was totally ready for the coming of the son our Messiah our Savior was it was ready prophetically and that's kind of how we ended our time together last week we were talking about God's choice for a place for this precious gift to be born in that little humble town of Bethlehem as prophesied by the prophet Micah in chapter 5 verse 2 we talked about the announcement how it was made not not to world leaders to the movers and shakers of that time but rather to the most humble of all those Shepherds that were tending the flock out in the field and it was to them that God announced this great deliverer this great gift and and why did God choose this humble place and these humble people well I believe one of the reasons is he knew they would get the word out and the scripture tells us we read it when we were together last Luke chapter 2 verses 8 through 20 it talks about just that they went everywhere sharing the good news that the angel of the Lord and the heavenly host had delivered to them the savior has come oh my what a joyous event that was we are so grateful to be able to and this whole plan of both condescension God coming down to live humbling himself to live among man and also the Incarnation which is the the Word of God being transformed into a body of flesh a man who would experience the same emotions and the same feelings that you and I other men and other women would also experience we know because of God's plan he chose it this way he could have come in any form he could have had a plan of salvation that looked very differently than the one that we now know to be the way but he chose this way and every detail of it he chose for a reason for a particular purpose and to speak a particular message I love that about our God he is meticulous in detail he never misses anything he cannot lie he does not contradict himself and prophetically he prepares the hearts of men and women long before he does something among them and we can say that our hearts are being prepared have been prepared to prophetically of what we will see in fact what we are seeing unfolding in both the world at large and also in the body of Christ so we are not just ignorant people bumping around in the darkness trying to figure out what's going on but the very hour that we're living in has been foretold it has been prophesied the good the bad and the ugly and so we don't have to be afraid we don't have to be fearful this is one of the messages that Jesus delivered the most in his earthly recorded ministry don't fear don't be afraid be not afraid it is high and I believe he did that because he knew that that one of our most common reactions as humans is to be fearful the Bible tells us that perfect love his perfect love casteth out fear fear brings torment but peace is brought to our lives with a relationship with Jesus Christ and his peace and his love banishes fear I thought we would read John 1 again hopefully I can do it in such a way that I won't have to repeat so much of the commentary but I think it's such beautiful words too to begin to sum up what we've been studying in John 1 verse 1 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word and and the Word was God the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shyness in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world he was in the world this is our Savior he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him and this remains true today as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name hallelujah which were born verse 13 not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God that's God's sons they're not born by the will of the flesh or by the will of man but by the will of God and verse 14 really pulls together the first couple of verses of John one and the word was made flesh we already know that the word was from the beginning that the Word was with God that the Word was God and now we know that the Word was made flesh that is the Incarnation and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth what a beautiful demonstration of the word the word has now taken on a fleshly body verse 15 John bare witness of him and cried saying this was he of whom I spake he that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was before me and of his fullness have all we received and grace for grace for the law was given by Moses but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ what wonderful words 17 verses of beautiful truth that have direct Packt on my life on your life as a real believer in Jesus Christ what grace and what a gift he is to us here is a couple of other portions of Scripture that I think are so important in in grasping and also in rejoicing in the beauty of the Incarnation Philippians chapter 2 verse 7 and 8 but made himself this is our Messiah but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross he humbled himself as God who had become man as God who had been made flesh it was necessary even though this was the greatest condescension what an act of humility that God the creator of all things would come down and live as a man but now that he has chosen to live to be manifested as a man in a body of flesh his lesson continues he has to continue to learn the path of humility he has to Humble himself so that he can become obedient unto death even to the death of the Cross for us that we could be saved remember in Gethsemane this place of the press the Olive Press when our Lord was being pressed because there was a spirit life in him that had to be made available to you and I and in that suffering moment he prayed that prayer if at all possible this is more another demonstration of him having to continuously humble himself and bring his body into subjection obedient unto death that's what we see if it all possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not my will but your will be done you know friend if our Lord Jesus Christ had to pray such a prayer if he had to continue to learn obedience by suffering in life how much more must you and I also learned to bring ourselves into that place of humility before God that we would seek his will even above our own will above our own way I want to share another portion of Scripture with you in fact I'm gonna load you down with Bible verses today and as we mentioned last week I hope you'll do your homework I hope you'll look them up in your own Bible and ask the Lord to make them even more real to you and your private devotion Ephesians chapter 1 verses 3 through 12 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love this is only possible because of the grace of God in our lives verse 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children what we've been speaking about by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved we have been made accepted because of the blood that covers our lives not because we always get it right we we strive remember we talked about the bow and the arrow and and we make every effort to strike the target in the bull's eye but sometimes we miss the center and our arrow veers a little to the right or the left but we must always try to get it right but in those times that we don't get it right we can't throw up our hands and quit and say what's the use we must remember that it is not by our always getting it right that we're saved it is by His grace it is by his death the provision of his blood that we're saved not of our good works lest we would have reason to boast in the flesh but because it is the gift of God and he has made us accepted he has made us acceptable in the beloved verse 7 in whom we have redemption remember we talked about what this redemption is to bring us all the way back when we get off and most of us did in our lives we came into this world very innocent but it didn't take long for us to learn a crooked path did it but it's His grace to redeem us through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace I'm so glad that His grace never runs out I'm so glad his love never gives up on me verse 8 wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will I believe that's part of this study I believe that's part of the reason why you have have tuned in to this program it's because God wants to make known to you personally as an individual the mystery of his concerning your life what all this is about it's not about building bigger churches although we need nice facilities to gather all the people in to worship God but it's not about building little kingdoms down here on the earth and and seeing how good we can be and and and you know dying and having a lot of nice things said about us at the end of our life it's about so much more than that it's about his good pleasure toward us his will for our lives being fulfilled by our humbling by humbling ourselves by bringing ourselves into that place of submission it is an act of the will and I tell you you know I made that decision to follow the Lord a long time ago prior to 1975 and yet I still have to bring my will I think I mentioned that recently I I still have to bring my will down I have to grab a hold up and say wait a minute I know what I want I know what I think ought to be done but something tells me God has another plan so I had better submit my will to his will because if I have God's will I will have the very best for my life it will turn out for me to be the very best I know that I've learned that by experience verse 9 having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times the very thing we've been studying he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on the earth even in him you and I are a part of that great big gathering together of all things into Christ that is a portion of what's being accomplished in our lives in this hour we're being gathered together in Christ in spirit to be one with Christ in spirit to be one with one another in spirit because we are one with him this was the prayer of our Lord that that you and I might experience a oneness in the same manner that he has experienced and demonstrated oneness with the Father oh praise God for that verse 11 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance I love that you know III III don't know so much about inheritance here in this world I I didn't have any rich uncles and I received an inheritance from my grandmother when she passed away and and pretty much saddled that's it that'll be it but I have an inheritance it doesn't take long to go through the natural inheritance does it there's always something you want to buy but we have an inheritance hallelujah that it's not temporal it's it's not cash to spend at the mall it's so much more than that it's eternal life but it's even more than that it's victory it's victory that we can tap into in our everyday life in whom also we have obtained an inheritance how being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will he does he does he's working all things out according to the counsel of his own will verse 12 that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ that we should be to the praise we become praise to his glory praise is not just what we do praises who we become because if our life is ever-increasingly submitted to him then he receives reward he receives reward he receives glory by our life because our life then becomes a reflection of his grace and his love when those beautiful people so many years ago some of them from the UK others from Saxony in different places in Europe made up their mind in a place called herrnhut under the leadership of Count Zinzendorf we're going to go to the Isles we're going to sell ourselves into slavery we're going to work in the sugar cane fields of the tropics of the Caribbean and we're going to be witness and salvation we're going to be light to many of those slaves some of which who had been taken from Africa some of them sold into slavery in the Caribbean and some swam ashore after shipwreck and then became slaves here were white faced men who sold themselves into indentured servitude slavery so that they might work in the same fields as many of those others slaves who had been stolen from their land from their home because they wanted them to know that even though you're living in in bondage in the natural you don't have to be slaves in the spirit you can be free on the inside no matter what's going on in your life on the outside and when they were questioned why would you do such a thing leave everything behind some of them had had and some of them even had wealth why would you sell that why would you give that all away and sell yourself into slavery to be a light to men that you don't even know their reply so famously recorded was that the Lamb may receive the reward of his suffering you and I become as the scripture said that we should be to the praise of his glory that the Lamb may receive the reward for his suffering I want you to know there is no way to describe the the amount the degree of pain and agony and suffering that our Lord went through willingly willingly for you and I as part of the great plan of redemption yes we talked about his flesh his body rejected the idea he struggled in that realm but he said nevertheless not my will but your will be done what a price paid for me what a gift given to both myself and to you and to so many others and the least that I can do is live a life that will somehow somehow glorify God and bring praise to his name to say to the world it's worth it to serve the Living God I want you to know friend it is worth it all Christians real Christians real believers have problems yes we do but we're not alone we have someone going with us walking with us talking with us you can pour out your heart to him right there in your flat where you're living right now you can just pour your heart out to him and he here's somebody said well I don't feel any different this is not always about feelings it's always about faith sometimes thank God we can feel the witness the Bible said we will know we're saved by the coming alive by the quickening in our spirit or of our spirit but we don't always have the feeling the sensation is not always there but faith becomes an anchor to the soul and remember at the end of the day no if we chose we would always choose the easy life we would choose for everything to be to be beautiful to be good to feel good to look good this is what we would choose for ourselves but at the end of the day we want to live a life that the lamb may receive the reward of his suffering that we can point the way for others that they can find the same inheritance that's coming to you and I God has a plan that's what we've been what we've been talking about week after week now God has a plan he hasn't abandoned his plan there is no plan B this is the plan for the salvation of those who can recognize the call of God in their life I want to make a list with you I want you to adjust these verses down if you possibly can because I'm not going to read the verse I'm just going to give you the address and and maybe they'll be able to share it with you there if not then hopefully we could get it on YouTube for you to read here are some beautiful points that have been laid up for us that we can see again the great work again it could have come anyway he could have chosen an easy way to bring you and I in to reconciliation and into fellowship with him but he didn't you the easy way he chose a hard way a painful way a difficult way but he chose that because he wanted to give us a full picture if it would have been easy then the then the price you know wouldn't have been so great and that that would have really indicated that we have such little value but God loved you so much and he considered you such a treasure he considered you so valuable that he chose a plan to redeem you that would be the cost list of all acquisitions what a costly way he chose listen to this list he descended he came down that we might ascend John 6:38 John 14:3 he became poor so that we might become rich second Corinthians 8 verse 9 James chapter 2 verse 5 he was born into the world that we might be born again of the Spirit john 1:14 john 3 verse 2 and verse 7 he became a servant he was a son but he became a servant so that we might become sons Philippians chapter 2 verse 7 Galatians you should know this chapter 4 verses 6 & 7 he left his home he came here with no home that we might have an eternal home remember when Jesus said the son of man half no place to lay his head Matthew chapter 8 verse 20 and John chapter 14 verse 2 he was hungry so that we might be fed he became the Living bread that we can feed on and yet the God of all eternity became a man and experienced all of the emotion all of the temptation and all of the feelings of a man he even became hungry so that he might become our food and that we might be fed Matthew chapter 4 verse 2 and John chapter 6 verse 50 in his death he became thirsty that that we might become satisfied by drinking the living water that flows forth from the Lord remember in his death he was thirsty they didn't give him water they gave him bitter gall they gave him vinegar for his thirst no mercy and yet he said to the woman at the well if you drink this water John for you're going to be thirsty again but I have water for you to drink and if you drink that water you will never ever be thirsty again read John 19 verse 26 he was stripped naked so that he might become for us our clothing our clothes of righteousness we can be clothed because he was made naked Matthew chapter 27 verse 28 Galatians chapter 3 verse 27 he was forsaken that we might not ever have to be forsaken thank God Matthew 27 verse 26 and Matthew 28 verse 20 everything about his life everything about his death everything about his resurrection speaks it preaches to us it speaks to us of what he has made available for us the gift of his life he was sad he was broken that we might become glad that we might have a gladness that's more it's not just based on circumstance it's based on the real joy of the Lord I say a 53 verse 3 and Philippians chapter 4 verse 4 he was bound so that you and I who are bound might be set free Matthew chapter 27 and verse 2 John chapter 8 verses 32 through 36 he was made sin made sin the Scriptures clear that we might be made righteousness he who knew no sin he who was guilty of no sin yet he was made sin so that you and I who are barely capable of any righteousness in our own at all in fact the scripture said all of our righteousness is just like filthy rags but he became sin was made sin so that you and I might be made righteous made acceptable 2nd Corinthians chapter 5 and verse 21 he died ultimately that we might live and never have to die I know there's a physical death to this body but to the believer we're just changing clothes we're just stepping out of one realm into another realm I do not believe the grave is the end John chapter 5 verses 24 and 25 and then the last one in this list he came down we talked about the fact that he descended that we might have sinned but he came down that we might be caught up there is a revelation of truth that says he is coming again and we're going to be caught up to meet him in the air and I believe that with all my heart 1st Thessalonians chapter 4 verses 16 and 17 what to understand these verses of Scripture to understand the totality of what our Lord Jesus Yeshua our Messiah has accomplished on our behalf we have to go back some time to the Old Testament we have to look at the sacrificial system that the offering system and what was required to to temporarily cover sin hide sin and Jesus came for a much higher purpose didn't he he didn't just cover our sin but he remitted it he so ultimately has reconciled us to God that in the heart of God in the mind of God there is no record there is no memory of our sin so I enjoyed the book of Hebrews I have to be honest I loved the book of Hebrews because it so beautifully takes the requirements of the older covenant and shows us how Yeshua Jesus Christ came to fulfill every detail every detail of that law so that you and I born under that law could be redeemed and ultimately reconciled to God so I love these verses and in closing out this series I'm going to share these with you again as well Hebrews chapter 9 verse 11 and 12 this but Christ that word Christ the Anointed One the creoles The Anointed One of God became an High Priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once just think about it I got putting a finger there just think about it the priest daily offering blood offerings in the tabernacle and later in the temple every day covering different aspects of man's transgression now we know it was once a year on the day of atonement that the high priest would go in into the Holy of Holies and sprinkle blood but every day they were offering those offerings those blood offerings in the outer Court of the tabernacle to make a covering for man's sin and they did it continuously but by his own blood Hebrews 9:12 he entered into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us how many times he only had to do at one time his blood was sufficient it did what all the blood of all of those other animals offered unto God could not do his precious blood it satisfied and finished this great work and I love the way that the Apostle shares that with us having obtained eternal redemption for us all and then I like Hebrews 9 23 through 26 every bit of this at the right time in the right manner everything set up time had come to its fullness for God demonstrate this kind of love and this gif to Planet Earth and here we are two thousand years later very much made partakers we are very blessed to be partakers of this same gift even now it was therefore necessary 9:23 of Hebrews it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these remember when the Mishkan in the wilderness when the Tabernacle in the wilderness was being made Moses was caught up by God by the spirit into heaven and he was shown the pattern of things before the very throne he came back to the earth after having had this experience and he wanted under the instruction of God to build a replica in the earth and that's what we have in the order of the tabernacle a replica of the throne room of God but the real altar and the real Ark and the real sea of glass etc holy Laver is the one in heaven what we had on the earth was it was simple form wasn't it but it is a type it is a it is a symbol of what it is what really is before the throne and so what was happening on the earth the priests were were operating in this form of worship and giving and offering and and the table of showbread and cleansing in the Laver and lighting of the holy menorah and all of these things but really it was just pointing to the real sacrifice that would one day take place in the heavenlies and let me read on effect let me repeat verse 23 it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these hallelujah praise God altar in the tabernacle the altar in the temple it received a lot of blood the blood of goats and calves and and and bullocks and doves but the real altar received only one blood hallelujah Precious Blood the blood of redemption the blood of Jesus Christ our Savior verse 24 for Christ it's not entered into the holy places made with hands on the earth which are the figures of the true those things that are in heaven but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us Oh hallelujah that's where the real price was paid he laid his own blood on the altar his blood on the real Holy of Holies which is the throne of God this is why you and I are saved everything else that was taking place in the tabernacle and in the temple it was only sufficient for that moment but what he has done for us remember it has purchased eternal redemption for all mankind verse 24 again for Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us I want you to say for me he has appeared for me hallelujah and thank God he didn't appear empty-handed he appeared with the blood of redemption nor yet that he should offer himself often as the high priest enter it entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others oh no verse 26 for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself this sinn issue if you can believe if you can believe the sin problem is solved the sin issue has been dealt with once and for all by the blood of the spotless Lamb of God and all we have to do is be willing to repent of our unbelief to accept that sacrifice on our behalf and serve God what does it mean brother Shelly to serve God it means to give him control it means to obey his word as we can see it and know it by the spirit it means to choose the right thing to choose love it's not always easy to choose love but it's our responsibility to choose love and to find out what God wants from our lives so that every day we're living alive as we mentioned so that the lamb may receive the reward for his suffering and Ephesians 4:10 he that descended is the same that also ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things fulfill means to fill up to its completeness and what the blood of all of these other animals could not do thanks be to God the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ took care of it let me share one more verse and that is Colossians chapter 2 verse 14 and 15 blotting out the handwriting of Ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to the cross every accusation against my soul every accusation against my life has been nailed to the cross and when Jesus was dying the lie against me died the accusation against me died it doesn't even matter that I was guilty I was guilty it wasn't just a made-up accusation it was the truth I was guilty of sin the scripture says shapen and born in iniquity formed that way came into this world speaking lies and as soon as I was old enough I would make choices that would bring me into further unbelief and into further sin but every bit of that was nailed to the cross when my Lord was nailed to the cross having been made sin woe for you and I that every bit of my debt was nailed there as well and he paid the price verse 15 and having spoiled principalities and powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it it's really a celebration but he also mocked them it's the same demonstration as as Elijah when when the the showdown on Mount on Mount Carmel was taking place and and they the followers of Al they jumped around and screamed and hollered and cut themselves and did all kinds of things to get their false gods there they're non-existent God to move on their behalf and Elijah walked up and mocked him a little bit he said where is your God is he on vacation he must be asleep this scripture says that when our Lord died on the cross he did exactly that he was mocking the principalities he was showing them hey what you have desired to do today is defeated you have desired to take all men to hell you've desired you're a thief and a murderer the thief cometh not more but for to steal and to kill and to destroy but by the death of Jesus Christ on that cross when he offered himself up he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it hallelujah what you meant you meant to destroy all of mankind today that is canceled today away has been made hallelujah I feel good I'm excited to be a part of this great program this great plan so this series the fullness of the time means that we can now live in the full inheritance of God's spiritual blessings in our life if we are willing to surrender everything we have everything we are to his Sovereign Grace I'm telling you this couldn't have happened any other way than the way it has happened God made the plan God paid the price on our behalf and what we want to do is worship Him I want to bow down and worship Him not just with my body but with my whole life I want to give him everything I pray for you right now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that this beautiful plan of redemption that came in the fullness of the time I pray that it will be made such a living reality to you that from this day forward you will choose to live a lay down life for the one who laid down his life on your behalf I pray for healing in your body because that is the promise of the word he was wounded for our transgression and bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes we are healed I ask you Lord to let that healing manifest in in bodies right now let there be testimonies come from this simple moment of prayer and faith we ask o God for greater understanding and revelation of your word in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray a and any man I hope you've enjoyed this series I have certainly enjoyed teaching you and bringing it
