[0:00] hello I'm pastor Stephen Shelley of New
[0:02] Hope revival ministries in Smith Station
[0:05] Alabama I want to share with you today
[0:08] some of the things that the Lord has
[0:10] been dealing with me about in my own
[0:12] personal walk with him I want to start
[0:15] off by reading a portion of Scripture
[0:18] found in the Book of Psalms in fact it's
[0:21] Psalm 149 beginning in verse 1 praise ye
[0:28] the Lord sing unto the Lord a new song
[0:32] and his praise in the congregation of
[0:36] saints let Israel rejoice in him that
[0:41] made him let the children of Zion be
[0:44] joyful in their king let them praise His
[0:48] name in the dance
[0:52] let them sing praises unto him with the
[0:55] timbrel and harp for the Lord taketh
[0:59] pleasure in his people he will beautify
[1:04] the meek with salvation let the Saints
[1:08] be joyful in glory
[1:11] let them sing aloud upon their beds and
[1:15] I want you to pay close attention to
[1:18] verse 6 let the high praises of God be
[1:23] in their mouth and a two-edged sword in
[1:30] their hand let the high praises of God
[1:35] be in their mouths and a two-edged sword
[1:41] in their hand you know I recently spoke
[1:45] to you about giving thanks about
[1:48] Thanksgiving because we here in the
[1:51] States were celebrating a time with our
[1:54] family set aside to give thanks to God
[1:57] but you know the Bible tells us that we
[2:01] should constantly and continually be
[2:05] giving God praise Psalm 34 verse 1 said
[2:09] I will bless the Lord
[2:12] at all times his praise shall
[2:17] continually be in my mouth and you know
[2:22] I understand that we have jobs to do and
[2:25] lives to live and duties and
[2:28] responsibilities I understand that we
[2:31] might not always be able to lift our
[2:35] hands and go about speaking praises to
[2:38] God but I believe that there is an
[2:41] attitude that we can set in our heart
[2:44] one of gratitude one of praise you know
[2:49] when I read this portion of scripture in
[2:52] Psalm 149 I'm not really getting that
[2:56] this is only an inner response to the
[3:02] goodness of God but I'm getting the idea
[3:05] that the psalmist believed that his God
[3:10] was so good and so faithful and so
[3:14] powerful that he deserved a high praise
[3:18] a special praise one that is set apart
[3:23] one that is full and complete and
[3:28] sincere I grew up in the Pentecostal
[3:32] church and well some of the Saints would
[3:36] have little sayings that they would say
[3:39] over and over again and they have stuck
[3:41] with me through my life I would
[3:45] sometimes maybe be working with some of
[3:48] the brothers maybe we would be having a
[3:50] work day at the church and something
[3:53] would go wrong and somebody would say ho
[3:56] praise the Lord
[3:58] anyhow I understood that that was a man
[4:03] who wanted to say in the good times and
[4:06] in the bad times when things are going
[4:08] good praise him and when things are
[4:10] going bad praise him I understand that
[4:13] but the psalmist here is not speaking
[4:16] about that kind of praise he's talking
[4:20] about a particular praise let the high
[4:25] praises of God be in their mouth I
[4:29] looked at that word in the Hebrew and
[4:32] it's a feminine word a feminine noun
[4:34] it's used to indicate praise throughout
[4:38] the Old Testament it's used in the sense
[4:42] of lifting up raising up or rising up
[4:48] one word that we could use that would be
[4:51] very similar to this word is exaltation
[4:54] and then I woke up a Sunday morning the
[4:59] two ago and it was in my mind to try to
[5:04] figure out higher praise Lord how could
[5:09] I give you a higher praise than what
[5:13] I've been offering you I just went over
[5:15] to the computer and I looked up synonyms
[5:20] for the word higher and it gave me some
[5:25] help in definition first and then in
[5:28] synonyms in definition it said advanced
[5:33] higher praise advanced in complexity or
[5:40] elaboration I think that we could use
[5:44] that word in fact it was suggested that
[5:47] sometimes you might hear the word used
[5:49] like higher education or higher
[5:53] mathematics and what that means is not
[5:56] base level but advanced studies if the
[6:02] psalmist said that we as believers
[6:04] should go about with the high praise or
[6:08] the higher praises of God in our mouths
[6:12] he means not just an ordinary praise the
[6:16] Lord thank you Jesus Oh hallelujah I
[6:21] think he means we ought to get involved
[6:24] in our praise the Bible talks about in
[6:28] the Book of Psalms those nine different
[6:32] forms of Davidic praise where the
[6:35] posture of the body is used we
[6:38] the hands are used for clapping or for
[6:41] lifting up or for playing instruments
[6:44] the postures of the body would be laying
[6:47] prostrate before the Lord or kneeling
[6:50] before him and in some Psalms it talks
[6:54] about standing in the congregation of
[6:56] the saints and then there were those
[6:59] three vocal expressions of Davidic
[7:02] praise where we would sing to the Lord
[7:05] and where we would shout to the Lord and
[7:09] where we would speak of the goodness of
[7:11] the Lord
[7:12] these are the biblical expressions of
[7:16] praise I know that sometimes people say
[7:20] well I wasn't made up to to be
[7:22] demonstrative or to be excitable well I
[7:27] want you to know if you should take a
[7:29] good look at the goodness of God in your
[7:32] life you would have a hard time just
[7:36] settling for praise the Lord I think you
[7:41] would want to lift up his name with
[7:44] everything that's within you and what I
[7:46] found out is when things are tough when
[7:50] things are less than lovely that's the
[7:53] best time to lift up a high praise
[7:56] anyway back to the word higher those
[8:00] synonyms that I found were tall acute
[8:05] even thrill or piercing lofty grand high
[8:11] flown like a flag that's been raised all
[8:14] the way up to the top of the flagpole
[8:17] not down here at the bottom of the
[8:21] flagpole or half mass they call it but a
[8:24] high praise one that just lifts the Lord
[8:27] way up in exaltation in rising up and in
[8:34] praising him elevated raised heightened
[8:38] high priced expensive dear costly strong
[8:43] fierce and then we know that in the
[8:48] natural that word high or higher
[8:51] is sometimes used for those who are
[8:53] inebriated or tipsy are loaded or
[8:56] drunken well I want you to know that
[8:59] there are examples in the Bible where
[9:01] men and women fell under the inspiration
[9:04] of the Holy Spirit and they began to
[9:07] dance before the Lord in what those
[9:10] looking on would have described they
[9:13] were in a drunken state I know that
[9:17] sometimes that really flies against our
[9:20] dignity but I want to be like the
[9:23] psalmist David he was not a perfect man
[9:27] nor am i but he was a man after God's
[9:30] own heart I want to be that kind of man
[9:34] and I'm sure that many of you have that
[9:37] same desire we're going to make mistakes
[9:40] we're going to fail along the way but
[9:43] God is good he is good in all things at
[9:49] all times I'm finding out that if we
[9:52] gripe and complain we are outside of the
[9:57] will of God I know that your desire like
[10:01] mine is to be in God's will not standing
[10:06] on the outskirts of his will looking
[10:09] into what could be but right straight in
[10:13] the middle of his perfect will for our
[10:17] life and if we are in that perfect will
[10:21] there is no room for griping and
[10:23] groaning and complaining and if this is
[10:27] our habit I think it speaks to us that
[10:31] we are not finding that place with him
[10:36] where we can live the blessed life the
[10:39] favored life I tell you it doesn't mean
[10:42] that pains won't come sickness will come
[10:46] and heartaches will come but I want you
[10:48] to know the biblical precedent the
[10:51] example that has been set for us in
[10:54] God's Word is that our response should
[10:59] be praise
[11:01] again not ordinary praise but high
[11:06] praise and in this verse of scripture I
[11:11] feel inspiration I feel that the
[11:15] psalmist is saying that high praise that
[11:19] elevated praise becomes warfare it
[11:23] becomes strategy for battle just like
[11:27] having that two-edged sword and I want
[11:31] you to know that is the Word of God and
[11:34] if you are armed with the Word of God
[11:37] then you are a powerful believer if you
[11:43] understand that word by Holy Spirit
[11:46] revelation and if you are staying in
[11:49] that word and have planted your life
[11:53] firmly on the uncompromised Word of God
[11:57] not a watered-down modern version but a
[12:02] pure word like the Holy Spirit just
[12:07] takes that scripture and makes it alive
[12:10] to you I always say that when we receive
[12:14] a revelation like that that truth
[12:17] becomes a part of who we are and we
[12:20] become a part of that truth I was
[12:24] recently reading about a woman who led a
[12:27] prayer meeting and I didn't know if I
[12:29] was going to share it today or not it
[12:32] was in California and it was a women's
[12:37] prayer meeting many years ago her name
[12:40] was Francis Metcalf and something that
[12:44] she said has really stuck with me she
[12:48] said that the Word of God was just
[12:51] speaking to her in such a profound way
[12:53] about prays and finally she felt like
[12:58] the Lord said to her I want you to
[13:01] become praise personified I don't know
[13:07] if that means anything to you or not but
[13:10] that really gets ahold of me
[13:14] become an embodiment of praise now that
[13:17] is one way that we can praise the Lord
[13:21] continually because our life becomes a
[13:25] praise it means that we are making
[13:27] choices that honor God and honor God's
[13:31] Word and that even our obedience becomes
[13:36] praised to him wouldn't you like for
[13:40] your very life to be a praise unto the
[13:45] Lord so that when you are say involved
[13:49] in other activities not Church related
[13:53] not particularly spiritual but yet your
[13:57] life has been transformed by the Word of
[13:59] God and so your language is different
[14:03] your response and reaction to the things
[14:06] that happen to you
[14:08] are different and the world watches and
[14:11] they see and they know there's something
[14:14] different in your life perhaps they even
[14:18] ask you how is it that you can be so
[14:22] calm in the midst of such chaos I have
[14:26] to confess to you I've not always
[14:29] handled chaos that well sometimes we get
[14:35] in a tither when things start falling
[14:38] apart all at one time or we have a time
[14:41] deadline but I want to work on that in
[14:45] my life I want to know and trust because
[14:49] that's what this lifestyle of praise
[14:52] really is it is a life of trust it's
[14:57] saying to God no matter what happens to
[14:59] me I know it's going to be alright
[15:01] because you are sovereign God and you
[15:05] love me I want you to know child of God
[15:09] he loves you and he desires your praise
[15:14] in fact the scripture said he inhabits
[15:17] he lives in the praises of his people I
[15:23] truly believe that there is power
[15:27] when we enter into a place of higher
[15:30] praise maybe you get in this in the
[15:34] atmosphere of your church service you
[15:37] begin to worship the Lord you begin to
[15:40] move a little bit beyond your comfort
[15:42] zone you give God a little more respect
[15:47] and honor and praise than you normally
[15:50] do I believe
[15:52] if you're willing to make even that
[15:54] sacrifice of praise there's power the
[15:58] power of God comes in when the children
[16:03] of God enter into praise sincere praise
[16:08] it draws the anointing it draws the
[16:12] presence of God into the room now I
[16:14] mentioned in your in the sanctuary of
[16:18] your church but it doesn't have to be
[16:21] there but I'm not going to praise God
[16:23] like a wild man in my home and then go
[16:27] to church and act like a little church
[16:28] mouse now I want to have an an even
[16:32] lifestyle of praise now I tell you
[16:35] sometimes I get pretty rowdy in my home
[16:37] even in my office just over and over
[16:41] again when you when you just take a
[16:44] moment to meditate and reflect on what
[16:47] could have been but God had it not been
[16:51] for God and how he moved in a particular
[16:54] situation you could be facing something
[16:57] so different than what you're facing
[16:58] right now and your heart just swells up
[17:01] with Thanksgiving and you've got to let
[17:04] it out
[17:04] and somehow oh maybe I'm just an
[17:08] emotional sort of person but somehow
[17:10] just a little quiet hallelujah it
[17:15] doesn't seem to be enough the psalmist
[17:18] seems to be indicating that if we go
[17:22] forth with the high praises of God in
[17:24] our mouth and a two-edged sword in our
[17:28] hand we will be a people with the
[17:31] victory I want you to know God wants you
[17:35] and I to have the victory he is
[17:39] Victor and he wants you and I to
[17:42] fellowship with him in that victory he
[17:47] wants us to be overcomers not just
[17:50] survivors not just those who barely get
[17:54] through life I don't know what your
[17:57] circumstances are but I'm not talking
[18:00] about a praise I'm not talking about a
[18:03] Thanksgiving that's based on your
[18:05] circumstances
[18:06] remember when we were together before we
[18:10] talked about Habakkuk and the praise
[18:14] that he was offering to the Lord and he
[18:16] said even though the vines are bare and
[18:19] the trees are not bringing forth and the
[18:21] fields are barren yet I will praise the
[18:26] Lord I've got a feeling that his praise
[18:30] was not an everyday ordinary praise I
[18:33] have a feeling it was a high praise that
[18:37] kind of praise pushes back the enemy it
[18:41] pushes back the darkness when Pentecost
[18:46] when that movement of the Spirit of God
[18:50] was breaking out in America the west
[18:53] coast of the United States in Los
[18:58] Angeles California
[18:59] there was an utterance of the spirit
[19:03] that went forth in some of those
[19:07] services and a lot of it was recorded by
[19:11] different individuals and it is reported
[19:14] that in one of those glory meetings a
[19:17] word came forth and said praising the
[19:22] Lord puts the devil to flight it appears
[19:27] that the Spirit of God wanted to make it
[19:31] real to those new believers they were
[19:35] new spirit filled believers they were
[19:39] experiencing God in a way they had never
[19:42] experienced him before and the Spirit of
[19:45] God evidently wanted to instruct them
[19:49] is part of your spiritual arsenal it's
[19:54] one of the weapons in your armory it
[19:57] puts the devil to flight I'm convinced
[20:01] that Satan doesn't know what to do with
[20:03] us when our response is high praise
[20:08] especially when tragedy grief loss the
[20:13] death of a loved one
[20:15] some turn of events in family
[20:19] relationships that could easily throw us
[20:23] into despair or at the least depression
[20:27] and yet we choose like Paul and Silas to
[20:31] come in the midnight hour and offer God
[20:35] a high praise not some moan full praise
[20:43] nobody knows the troubles I've seen but
[20:48] one that says I will praise the Lord
[20:51] at all times I believe praise is a
[20:55] language of victory in Exodus chapter 15
[21:01] we read about God's victory by bringing
[21:06] the children of Israel through the Red
[21:10] Sea the Jewish people will sometimes say
[21:14] that it was the greatest demonstration
[21:16] of the supernatural power of God and we
[21:21] would say in the Old Testament he really
[21:26] saved his people that day and the Bible
[21:30] tells us that Moses led a song in verse
[21:35] 1 it says then sang Moses and the
[21:38] children of Israel this song under the
[21:40] Lord and that's X Exodus 15 in 1 I will
[21:45] sing unto the Lord for he hath triumphed
[21:48] gloriously the horse and his rider happy
[21:51] thrown into the sea the Lord is my
[21:55] strength and song and he has become my
[21:58] salvation he is my god and
[22:02] listen and I will prepare him and
[22:05] habitation my father's God and I will
[22:11] exalt him the Lord is a man of war the
[22:15] Lord is his name and it goes on and it's
[22:19] beautiful in verse 11 it says who is
[22:22] like unto thee O Lord among the gods who
[22:27] is like the glorious in holiness fearful
[22:31] in praises doing wonders thou stretches
[22:35] out by right hand the earth swallowed
[22:38] them thou in thy mercy has led forth the
[22:42] people which thou hast redeemed thou has
[22:45] guided them in thy strength unto thy
[22:48] holy habitation I like that phrase
[22:51] fearful in praises there is an awe there
[22:57] is a reverential fear that we can
[23:01] sometimes feel experienced when we look
[23:05] at the might and the power and even the
[23:09] mercy of our God our Father God and it
[23:15] it strikes a chord in us in fact
[23:19] sometimes it makes us say how could a
[23:22] God like that care about just one little
[23:26] individual like me I tell you he does
[23:29] and it's an awesome reality when that
[23:33] becomes real in your spirit man he's
[23:36] fearful and praises in fact what we
[23:39] praise him for sometimes and glorify God
[23:44] he and it actually becomes the terror of
[23:47] our enemies
[23:48] it was a serious event that took place
[23:52] that day God was giving the children of
[23:56] Israel passage toward the promised land
[23:59] and their response was songs of victory
[24:05] we sing an old hymn sometime all victory
[24:09] in Jesus my Savior
[24:12] forever and I want you to know that God
[24:15] wants to give you his victory if there's
[24:20] any part of your life that you have not
[24:23] surrendered to him fully completely
[24:27] there's no better time than the present
[24:30] to say Lord I surrender all Here I am
[24:35] take my life and if you can use me and I
[24:40] guarantee you he can no matter how
[24:43] broken you are if you can use me Lord
[24:46] then I would certainly want that that
[24:50] would be my desire let's be the
[24:54] victorious people of God in our praise
[24:58] let's use our praise to push back the
[25:02] darkness to create in us a new hope to
[25:09] restore some some real hope that the
[25:14] enemy has tried to steal from us what I
[25:16] find out is when you are weighted down
[25:20] by Hope deferred promises that you're
[25:23] weary and tired of waiting on your best
[25:28] response is to give God praise to let
[25:33] him know ok I'm not so happy about the
[25:37] timing but Lord I accept that as part of
[25:41] your plan for me because you are leading
[25:46] me into a response of praise when we
[25:51] praise the Lord in this manner it sends
[25:54] a message out there it sends a message
[25:57] to our Creator that we are grateful and
[25:59] thankful for his wonderful work in our
[26:02] life but it also sends a message to the
[26:05] enemy you know I'm convinced that that
[26:08] that Satan believed that he was going to
[26:12] take job off of the path of
[26:14] righteousness and that job would indeed
[26:17] curse God and die as his wife suggested
[26:21] in her pain
[26:23] but I want you to know there was no way
[26:28] in the world that a loving God would
[26:30] have allowed that kind of tragedy upon
[26:34] job had he not already known what job's
[26:38] response was going to be and though he
[26:43] had some low moments his testimony was
[26:47] oh how I would like to have a pen of
[26:52] iron that I could write these words I
[26:56] know that my Redeemer liveth hallelujah
[27:01] and this is our response in the good
[27:05] time and in the bad time I know that my
[27:09] redeemer lives and I know that he has a
[27:12] plan for my life I hope that you are
[27:16] encouraged in this moment I hope
[27:19] something has been said that will lift
[27:21] you and I hope that you will take this
[27:25] as your new strategy and if you have
[27:29] used this strategy of high praise before
[27:32] but have perhaps grown a little cold in
[27:35] it I pray that you will be renewed and
[27:40] as you are reminded today I pray that
[27:45] you will offer God a praise higher than
[27:51] what you've been offering him taller
[27:54] raise the flag all the way up to the top
[27:58] and give God a high praise today Lord
[28:02] bless you thank you for being with us
[28:05] bye-bye
[28:13] you
