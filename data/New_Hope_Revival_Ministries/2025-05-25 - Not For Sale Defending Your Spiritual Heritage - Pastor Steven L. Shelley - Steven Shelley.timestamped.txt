[34:55] kind of grief. It comes in waves. We
[34:58] don't understand it. Things affect us
[35:00] that have never affected us before when
[35:02] we're grieving. So, please remember that
[35:05] family and others who are still grieving
[35:08] their loss. Uh the Lord sees those needs
[35:11] and there are some traveling. Um Luke
[35:15] and Luke Yovich and his family left
[35:17] yesterday going to Mississippi for a
[35:19] family gathering today and they'll be
[35:22] coming back. I don't I didn't hear if
[35:23] they were this afternoon. That's a long
[35:26] way. Uh pray that God will be with them.
[35:29] Uh I know that brother R.J. and his
[35:32] family are going to Kansas this week and
[35:34] will be there for an extended period of
[35:36] time. We want to pray the Lord's safety
[35:39] over them and his protection along the
[35:42] way and uh traveling is is uh hard
[35:45] enough but to have small children, God
[35:48] is good to them and I know that he will
[35:50] be and I think sister Laurel and are
[35:53] traveling. Is it this week? They're
[35:56] traveling on Wednesday as well. Pray for
[35:58] them that God will be with them. Sister
[36:00] Trish mentioned to me yesterday that
[36:03] she's still struggling in her breathing.
[36:05] I know the Lord can move that. Yes. I
[36:08] prayed last night specifically because
[36:10] it hung in my mind that God would move
[36:12] that for her. Yes. Um I'm like other a
[36:16] few others here. Breathing is such an
[36:18] important part of life and and breathing
[36:22] the the ability not to you know the
[36:24] feeling of not breathing well that
[36:26] really gets me. So that stayed in my
[36:29] mind and I prayed, let's ask the Lord to
[36:32] just move that to bring perfect healing.
[36:34] Amen. And Jessica still, she's, of
[36:38] course, she needs our prayers like
[36:40] everyone else who is navigating a loss.
[36:43] Amen. Even Sister Cindy still, she has
[36:46] things that uh come up in her life that
[36:49] I know I know every day she misses
[36:52] Anthony. Pray that God will just give
[36:54] them the strength to press on. I'm glad
[36:57] we're about to see them all. Amen. Amen.
[37:01] This may not seem like a prayer song to
[37:03] you, but it's truth. Sing it with
[37:07] me. The name of the Lord
[37:12] is a strong
[37:16] tower. Righteous run
[37:19] into it and they are
[37:23] safe. The name of the Lord
[37:27] is a strong
[37:31] tower. Righteous run
[37:34] into it and they are
[37:40] saved. Blessed be the name of the
[37:44] Lord. Blessed be the name of the
[37:48] Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord
[37:52] most high.

[39:02] Lord. Blessed be the name of the
[39:06] Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[39:16] Yes, Lord.
[39:18] [Music]
[39:21] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. We come
[39:23] before you
[39:25] to bless you,
[39:28] King of the universe.
[39:34] Lord, may we have a
[39:37] fresh revelation
[39:40] of who you are.
[39:43] You're the God Almighty. Amen. You are
[39:46] that king. That king with all power and
[39:51] with all authority. That's right.
[39:55] Healing flows from your throne.
[40:00] Glory. Glory.
[40:03] Everything we need comes from you. We
[40:07] were created for you. That's right. And
[40:10] you gave us a heart and everything that
[40:14] heart needs comes only from you. That's
[40:18] right. And so right now, right now, oh
[40:22] God. Yes, sir. We look to you. Yes, sir.
[40:25] We look to you for the strength that we
[40:28] need to overcome. That's the truth.
[40:31] That's the for leadership of our lives,
[40:35] for every decision that we need to make
[40:38] because we know if it comes from you, it
[40:41] is right and it is perfect. That's
[40:44] right. Amen.
[40:47] Thank you, Jesus. Lord, if we could just
[40:50] see you right now, how you truly are,
[40:54] your character, your nature, your
[40:56] ability, our doubt would crumble and our
[41:00] faith would rise up
[41:03] to only look to you. So, we just speak
[41:06] to the rock. Let healing flow right now
[41:11] in the authority of Yeshua,
[41:15] the one who is risen from the dead. Yes.
[41:22] Yes. Lord, I'm asking right now, would
[41:25] you just stir up our innermost being?
[41:28] Lord, you promise there would come
[41:30] strength from our inner man. Oh, yeah.
[41:33] It's you, oh Father, in us, giving us
[41:36] the
[41:37] strength, giving us the comfort. Those
[41:40] that are grieving right now, you are the
[41:44] true comforter. It only comes from you.
[41:47] And what is amazing, Lord. Our hope is
[41:50] not for this moment only. It's for
[41:54] eternity.
[41:55] You're making something for eternity.
[41:59] You're making sons and daughters.
[42:00] They're going to m be mature. They're
[42:02] going to rule and reign. Amen. Of
[42:05] course, the life is hard. You promised
[42:08] it. You said so. But because of you, we
[42:12] have the strength to mature,
[42:15] to overcome,
[42:16] and the perfect plan is going to unfold.
[42:21] You're putting everything in place in
[42:24] the world.
[42:26] It's all coming together. Your word is
[42:29] coming together
[42:31] and your bride is going to step into
[42:34] place
[42:35] in union with you. Yes. And so we just
[42:39] ask that the perfect plan for every one
[42:41] of us would unfold and you would give us
[42:44] the grace to follow you because you said
[42:47] the spirit the sons of God are led by
[42:50] the spirit of God. Amen. May we just may
[42:53] we grasp that. Lord help us oh
[42:57] God. Lord to surrender everything to
[43:00] you. Oh ree to surrender everything to
[43:05] you Lord. We give you our hearts again.
[43:09] You gave it to us, but we're giving it

[43:15] our lives in the name of Yeshua.
[43:19] Amen. Amen.
[43:22] Praise the Lord.
[43:27] Hallelujah.
[43:32] Blessed be the name of the
[43:36] Lord. Blessed be the name of the
[43:40] Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord

[43:57] Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord
[44:02] most high.
[44:04] [Music]
[44:11] Hallelujah.
[44:17] Hallelujah. Oh, praise the Lord. Amen.
[44:21] You may have your seats today. Yes, sir.
[44:25] We are blessed to be in the house of the
[44:28] Lord gathered together. Caleb, it's nice
[44:31] to see you today. The Lord bless you.
[44:33] Pray that the Lord will help you here
[44:38] today. Sister Dorothy, it's nice to see
[44:41] you again today. The Lord bless you.
[44:47] Jessica and Brandy Michelle, it's always
[44:50] nice to see you, too. God bless you
[44:54] both. Sister Melinda Syler, it's nice to
[44:57] see you today holding the grandbaby.
[45:01] It's nice to have you here today. The
[45:02] Lord bless you. We're just glad to be
[45:05] gathered together in the house of the
[45:07] Lord. I am so thankful that he told us
[45:11] in the New Testament that out of men's
[45:13] bellies should flow rivers of living
[45:16] water. You know, he started out in the
[45:19] book of Genesis talking about a river
[45:21] that came out of Eden into the garden to
[45:24] water it and he hasn't left us without
[45:27] water since.
[45:29] He is the living water. Amen.
[45:34] The children of Israel had gotten to a
[45:36] place where that they had forsaken the
[45:38] Lord.
[45:40] And they chose other ways to get their
[45:42] water.
[45:45] They hewed them out sistns broken that
[45:49] couldn't hold water.
[45:52] But he said that he was a living water.
[45:55] And I'm thankful that he's still giving
[45:58] us that living water today and he's
[46:02] breaking down his word. I
[46:06] thought time and again and mentioned it
[46:09] to a few people when I moved
[46:13] here going toward 30 years
[46:16] ago. How is this possible? Next year
[46:19] will be 30 years.
[46:23] There was a booklet that was being
[46:25] distributed, write the
[46:27] vision. And that comes from the book of
[46:32] Habach. And to write the
[46:35] vision was of course about a vision of a
[46:39] bride coming to her maturity.
[46:43] And we've had our ideas. We've had our
[46:46] thoughts what all of it
[46:48] meant. But it's become so real over the
[46:52] last couple of weeks as we've been
[46:54] hearing the word of the Lord that the
[46:58] vision of a bride who is whole spirit,
[47:04] soul, and
[47:06] body. God is laying it out on the table.
[47:11] It is a written vision that is being put
[47:14] before us and it is being made so
[47:18] plain. The the truths of the word of God
[47:22] being made so plain to us, preached to
[47:26] us in such a way the the the
[47:29] the wording, the phrasiology, all of the
[47:33] words that are being used and broken
[47:36] down and given to us, we should not trip
[47:39] over it. We shouldn't we shouldn't in
[47:41] any way say I can't understand that
[47:44] language. It's being made plain. Very
[47:46] very plain. And why is that? It's
[47:49] because the Lord is wanting us to be
[47:52] whole.
[47:53] Completely whole in our spirit and in
[47:58] our soul, our mind, our will and our
[48:01] emotions and in our physical body. He
[48:04] wants a people who are so reliant on him
[48:08] until that we know that he is the source
[48:12] of all that we are and that we can come
[48:16] to him. Bring our needs, our brokenness,
[48:20] our our broken hearts, our grieving
[48:23] spirits, our bodies that are not uh
[48:26] cooperating right. We can bring it all
[48:29] to him and he is everything. I'm
[48:32] thankful for it. I'm thankful that I can
[48:35] be in a
[48:39] place where truth is told.
[48:45] Truth matters. It does.
[48:48] Again, we're glad that you're here in
[48:50] the house of the Lord. I'm glad to be
[48:52] here in under the under the presence of
[48:55] the canopy of the Lord to know that he's
[48:58] in the house. And uh, Brother Cade, will
[49:01] you get ready to sing? We're going to
[49:03] receive the tithe and offering and let
[49:06] Brother Cade uh, will worship with him
[49:08] as he sings and usher us into the
[49:11] preaching of the word. We just want to
[49:13] be in a right atmosphere for whatever
[49:15] the Lord wants to speak to us today.
[49:18] Getting all the distractions out of our
[49:20] minds, getting all of the disturbances
[49:23] off of our hearts, and just setting them
[49:25] aside. This is God's time. However long
[49:28] he wants to do it, this is his time and
[49:31] we give it to him. Brother Ellias, will
[49:33] you come and help us today? Brother
[49:34] Austin Hodes, will you help our brother
[49:37] and go to the people for the tithe and
[49:39] offering? Give as giving unto the Lord.
[49:41] And let's worship together as we're
[49:43] preparing our hearts for the preaching
[49:45] of the word.
[49:49] We love you,
[49:50] Jesus. We love you, Lamb of God. Thank
[49:53] you, Jesus.
[49:56] Bless your name,
[49:57] [Music]
[50:05] Lord, Lord. I come to you.
[50:11] Let my heart be
[50:14] changed,
[50:17] renewed, flowing from the
[50:21] grace that I
[50:25] found in you.
[50:35] Lord, I've come to
[50:38] know the weaknesses I
[50:43] see in
[50:45] me will be stripped
[50:52] away by the power of your
[51:01] love and
[51:04] Oh be
[51:07] close. Let your love
[51:11] surround
[51:14] me. Oh Jesus
[51:19] pray. Be near.
[51:22] Draw me to your
[51:26] [Music]
[51:29] side. In
[51:33] as I wait, I'll rise up like the
[51:42] eagle. And I will soar with you. Your
[51:47] spirit leads me on by the power of your
[51:52] love.
[51:53] [Laughter]
[51:58] [Music]
[52:00] Lord, unveil these
[52:03] eyes and let me see you
[52:08] face to face the knowledge of your
[52:15] love as you
[52:17] [Music]
[52:19] live in me.
[52:23] [Music]
[52:28] Lord renew my
[52:32] mind as your will
[52:36] unfolds in my
[52:38] life and living every
[52:43] [Music]
[52:45] day by the power of your love.
[52:56] Oh, hold me
[52:59] close and let your love
[53:03] surround
[53:06] me.
[53:08] Oh Jesus,
[53:11] bring me.
[53:15] Draw me to your
[53:22] side. And
[53:25] as I wait, I'll rise up like
[53:31] the
[53:35] eagle. And I will soar with you. Your
[53:39] spirit leads me on by the power of your
[53:49] [Music]
[53:51] love. Lord, I come to you.
[53:57] Let my heart be
[54:00] changed,
[54:03] renewed, and flowing from the
[54:07] grace that I
[54:10] found. Oh, in
[54:15] [Music]
[54:19] you, Lord. I've come to
[54:23] know all the weaknesses I
[54:28] see in
[54:31] me will be stripped
[54:35] away. Oh yes, by the power of your love.
[54:48] Oh, hold me
[54:52] close. Let your love
[54:55] surround
[54:58] me. Oh Jesus,
[55:03] breathe
[55:06] me. Draw me into your Sing it like a
[55:09] prayer with me right now.
[55:12] into your
[55:14] side and
[55:20] I rise like
[55:24] the promise of singing it and I will
[55:30] sing it. Your spirit leads me on by the
[55:35] power of your love. One more time.
[55:39] Enter into that. Let the Lord hold you.
[55:42] Oh, and
[55:44] hold hold me
[55:47] close. Let your love
[55:51] surround me. Let your love surround me.
[55:55] Oh Jesus, free
[56:02] draw me to your side.
[56:10] Oh, and
[56:12] as as I wait, I'll rise like
[56:18] the eagle
[56:21] [Music]
[56:23] and I will sow with you. Your spirit
[56:27] leads me on by the power of your
[56:33] love. Sing the last line. And I will
[56:36] soar with you. And I will soar with you.
[56:40] Your spirit, your spirit leads me
[56:44] on by the power of your love.
[56:53] Well, we thank you,
[56:55] Lord, for love that lifts
[56:59] us. Your love lifts us.
[57:04] Aren't you glad for a love that lives
[57:07] us?
[57:09] I was sinking deep in sin. Far from the
[57:14] peaceful shore, just a little bit, very
[57:19] deeply, staying
[57:21] within, sinking to rise no more.
[57:27] But the master of the sea, he heard my
[57:34] despairing
[57:36] cry, and from the waters lifted me, now
[57:42] safe am I. Oh, it was love lifted
[57:50] me. Oh, his love lifted me. I remember
[57:57] When nothing else could help,
[58:03] love lifted
[58:05] me. It was his love that lifted me. Oh,
[58:13] love lifted me.
[58:17] [Music]
[58:19] Nothing else could help
[58:24] love
[58:27] lifted
[58:28] me. One more
[58:31] verse. All my heart to him I give. Ever
[58:38] to him I'll
[58:41] cling. And in his blessed presence live,
[58:47] ever his
[58:49] praises. Love so mighty. Love so
[58:54] mighty and so true. It
[58:58] merits best
[59:01] songs. Faithful
[59:03] loving service to to
[59:08] him. Let me hear you sing.
[59:12] love lifted me. It was his love that
[59:18] lifted
[59:20] me when nothing else could help. Love,
[59:27] love lifted me. Oh, love lifted
[59:34] me. It was his love that lifted me.
[59:42] [Music]
[59:45] When
[59:48] love
[59:51] lifted
[59:54] me. His love lifted me. Praise the
[1:00:00] Lord. What
[1:00:03] love. What boundless
[1:00:06] love. What perfect love.
[1:00:09] What unconditional love the Lord has
[1:00:13] loved us with. Can you shout amen? It's
[1:00:17] wonderful to be in the presence of the
[1:00:19] Lord. Today it happens to be in church
[1:00:22] where we are enjoying his presence. But
[1:00:25] I appreciate being in the presence of
[1:00:27] the Lord every day of my life. He walks
[1:00:30] with me and he talks with me along the
[1:00:34] way and I'm thankful for it. and he will
[1:00:37] you if you'll make him lord of all. Uh
[1:00:40] the Bible tells us that the very nature
[1:00:43] of the eternal spirit of God, that
[1:00:45] father nature is a jealous God. One who
[1:00:50] says I want to be everything. And you
[1:00:54] know it's hard for human beings. He knew
[1:00:56] it. He made us this way. But it's hard
[1:00:58] for human beings to be that dependent on
[1:01:00] anything or anyone. But I'm glad we have
[1:01:04] somebody. Amen. Huh? We've got somebody.
[1:01:09] Praise the Lord. Aren't you glad you
[1:01:10] found the way? Amen. Amen. Uh let's
[1:01:14] thank God for the for the musicians,
[1:01:16] their
[1:01:17] gifts, and their giving of themselves to
[1:01:22] the work of the Lord. There's a stranger
[1:01:24] on the guitar this morning, and we
[1:01:26] surely appreciated him today. God bless
[1:01:28] you, brother. Glad you're home for the
[1:01:30] weekend. Would you get your Bibles this
[1:01:34] morning and uh turn to the book of First
[1:01:38] Kings, chapter
[1:01:40] 21? We want to say that uh somehow I
[1:01:44] didn't yet have it on my calendar. It
[1:01:45] takes me a year or so to get it that
[1:01:48] Judith's birthday, Judith Ellsworth's
[1:01:51] birthday was yesterday, May the 24th,
[1:01:54] and she is also one year old. We've got
[1:01:58] several of those one-year-olds this year
[1:02:01] because so many of the sisters were
[1:02:03] expecting at the same time. And we're
[1:02:06] excited about it. We're thankful for
[1:02:08] her. She's a cutie and she was making
[1:02:12] Google eyes at me this morning uh while
[1:02:15] she was there with her mother. And uh
[1:02:17] we're thankful for her and I I didn't
[1:02:20] get it on. I'm sorry. Tomorrow is Sharon
[1:02:22] Rose uh Van Hutin in the Netherlands.
[1:02:26] she was with us. It's her birthday
[1:02:29] tomorrow. We send lots of uh happy
[1:02:32] birthdays to her. And uh well, it's a
[1:02:36] beautiful time to be in Holland because
[1:02:38] the the tulips are probably still
[1:02:41] blooming. And if you've ever been there
[1:02:43] during that time, you know that it it
[1:02:45] looks like a postcard. And we send our
[1:02:48] love there. She shares a birthday with
[1:02:50] Jerusalem because tomorrow is Jerusalem
[1:02:53] Day. It's the day that especially when
[1:02:56] in Israel we celebrate the reunification
[1:02:58] of the city of Jerusalem and we're
[1:03:00] thankful for what God has done. And if
[1:03:03] you have ever uh taken a chance to pray
[1:03:05] as the scripture commands, pray for the
[1:03:08] peace of Jerusalem, then now would be a
[1:03:11] great time to do it because she has
[1:03:13] known a lot of troubles, hasn't she?
[1:03:16] Wednesday of this week is Sister
[1:03:18] Rebecca's daughter Mariah's birthday and
[1:03:21] we want to hold her up to the Lord in
[1:03:22] prayer. wish her a very happy birthday
[1:03:25] and pray that God's perfect will be done
[1:03:28] in her precious life. Her life like your
[1:03:31] life is precious to the Lord. Uh Friday
[1:03:34] is Chad's birthday. We got to spend uh
[1:03:38] see him and enjoyed him being around us
[1:03:41] yesterday. We want to continue to pray
[1:03:43] for him that he will go on to put the
[1:03:46] Lord first in his life and be all that
[1:03:49] God created him to be. And uh Friday is
[1:03:52] a good day to harass him in love. So
[1:03:54] take full advantage of that opportunity.
[1:03:57] I would you. And then Saturday, May 31st
[1:04:00] is Aaron's birthday. How old is Aaron
[1:04:02] going to be this time around? 15. Oh my.
[1:04:07] Uh we send our love to him. And they had
[1:04:11] a wonderful hike yesterday. Uh I'm
[1:04:13] assuming by the way a few of them smelt
[1:04:15] when they came into the birthday party
[1:04:17] that they enjoyed their time. And uh I'm
[1:04:21] glad they got to do both. And uh while
[1:04:23] saying that, let me say you made a pap's
[1:04:26] heart real happy yesterday. All your
[1:04:28] love that you showered on uh Elelliana
[1:04:32] and on Benjamin and Jenna. Uh it was
[1:04:34] very special. And uh she was very happy
[1:04:38] long into the night. I don't know how
[1:04:40] she slept. I didn't ask this morning,
[1:04:42] but she was still ready to play about 9
[1:04:44] or 9:30 last night. Still playing. and
[1:04:48] uh thank you for your love for our
[1:04:49] family. We appreciate it very much.
[1:04:51] First Kings chapter 21 beginning uh in
[1:04:56] verse one, I want to read a few verses
[1:04:58] of scripture. And I was going to say,
[1:05:00] Jason, we're always glad you're home.
[1:05:03] You know, we kind of went down the
[1:05:04] middle there. And since that those are
[1:05:06] your sisters, I thought, well, we ought
[1:05:08] to say we're glad you're with us all the
[1:05:10] time. It's a blessing. I appreciate it
[1:05:13] so much. I think of your mom so often. I
[1:05:16] think of things that she said to me and
[1:05:18] prayer requests that she gave me and it
[1:05:21] blesses me. She would be so thrilled
[1:05:23] that three of her I I know Brandy has
[1:05:25] church and goes to church and maybe
[1:05:27] Jessica too, but she would be thrilled.
[1:05:29] This was her church and she would be
[1:05:31] thrilled that three of hers are in
[1:05:33] church this morning and it's not
[1:05:34] Mother's Day. It's not not any they're
[1:05:37] just here in the Lord good. Verse one.
[1:05:41] And it came to pass after these things
[1:05:45] that Neabboth, let me hear you say
[1:05:47] Neabboth. That Neabboth, the Jezraelite,
[1:05:50] had a vineyard which was in
[1:05:53] Jezrael. And you know there's no J in
[1:05:56] the Hebrew language. So it it would be
[1:05:59] more like Yesel. Hard by the place hard
[1:06:03] by the place of Ahab, king of Samaria.
[1:06:08] When I think of that hard by the place,
[1:06:10] I think of subdivision living.
[1:06:14] That's not quite the life for me. I
[1:06:17] would like to be able to uh, you know,
[1:06:20] correct my children without my neighbor
[1:06:23] knowing everything I say. You
[1:06:26] understand? When you can pass sugar out
[1:06:28] the window to the neighbor in the next
[1:06:31] window, that's not my kind of living. So
[1:06:34] when I hear this verse, I I understand
[1:06:36] that Nabboth's vineyard bordered the
[1:06:40] land of Ahab, who was the king. And uh
[1:06:46] he was king of Samaria, indicating what
[1:06:49] part of the divided kingdom that he
[1:06:51] ruled over. But we might as well say
[1:06:54] Israel because he was Israel's king. And
[1:06:57] Ahab spake unto Nabboth, saying, Give me
[1:07:02] thy vineyard, that I may have it for a
[1:07:06] garden of herbs. Isn't that sweet? He
[1:07:08] wanted an herb garden, because it is
[1:07:12] near unto my house. In other words, my
[1:07:15] cooks don't want to have to walk so far
[1:07:18] to get the the uh herbs, and your
[1:07:22] vineyard would make a wonder. will just
[1:07:23] chop down the trees and and plant
[1:07:26] rosemary or something like that. And he
[1:07:29] said, "But I I'll give thee for it a
[1:07:31] better vineyard than it or if it seem
[1:07:36] good to thee, I will give thee the worth
[1:07:39] of it in money." That means I'll buy it
[1:07:44] for a fair value. You understand the
[1:07:47] proposal, don't you? The next verse. And
[1:07:51] Nabboth said to Ahab, "The Lord forbid
[1:07:54] it
[1:07:57] me that I should give the inheritance of
[1:08:02] my
[1:08:03] fathers unto
[1:08:06] thee." The Lord forbid it me.
[1:08:11] There is something from the Lord that
[1:08:14] constrains me from allowing this land to
[1:08:21] leave my family
[1:08:23] line. This is my
[1:08:25] heritage. And I know you're the king,
[1:08:28] but the Lord is forbidding me to turn
[1:08:32] this land over to anyone other than my
[1:08:35] my own family. This is a big bold
[1:08:39] statement to make to the king, to your
[1:08:42] king, to the one who decides whether you
[1:08:45] live or die. Can you follow the story so
[1:08:48] far? Let's get another verse and then
[1:08:50] I'll let you be seated. We'll read the
[1:08:51] rest. And Ahab came into his house
[1:08:56] heavy and
[1:08:58] displeased because of the word which
[1:09:00] Nabboth the Jezraelite had spoken to
[1:09:04] him. May I paraphrase by telling you he
[1:09:06] had pouty lips?
[1:09:09] He came in the house, the king of the
[1:09:12] land, with pouty lips, feeling sorry for
[1:09:17] himself because he didn't have the money
[1:09:20] or no, excuse me, because he wanted to
[1:09:22] buy something and they wouldn't sell it.
[1:09:26] It wouldn't be sold. might be like some
[1:09:29] of us who get our eye on a guitar or on
[1:09:34] uh you know something for the the house,
[1:09:38] maybe a a new couch or something. You
[1:09:41] but you can't get it. You just can't
[1:09:43] quite get it and you feel kind of
[1:09:45] disappointed and pouty. But this was
[1:09:48] multiplied many times over. He knew
[1:09:51] exactly what he was doing. This weak
[1:09:54] man. Weak man. He knew exactly what he
[1:09:58] was doing. He was appealing to the
[1:10:01] strength of his wife.
[1:10:04] Hello.
[1:10:06] Anybody here?
[1:10:08] Watch it. It said which Nabboth, let me
[1:10:12] start again. Ahab came into his house
[1:10:14] heavy and displeased because of the word
[1:10:16] which Nabboth the Jezraelite had spoken
[1:10:19] to him. For he had said, I will not give
[1:10:22] thee the inheritance of my fathers. I
[1:10:25] won't give it to you. I won't trade you
[1:10:27] for it. And I won't even sell it to
[1:10:30] you. It's not for sale. Let me hear
[1:10:34] somebody say, "Not for sale." Not for
[1:10:36] sale. And he laid down upon his bed and
[1:10:38] turned away his face. Oh my
[1:10:42] goodness. And he wouldn't even eat his
[1:10:46] supper. How sad. This is the king and
[1:10:51] he's behaving like a four-year-old.
[1:10:55] Somebody said, "Don't most husbands?"
[1:10:57] I'm not going
[1:10:59] there. Let's pray a moment. Father, in
[1:11:02] the name of Jesus, we thank you for the
[1:11:05] lifegiving power of your word. We thank
[1:11:08] you for every example given to us in
[1:11:11] scripture whereby as we learn in the New
[1:11:14] Testament that all scripture is inspired
[1:11:17] and every bit of it is given to us for
[1:11:20] instruction, for help and even for
[1:11:22] correction. And so we love looking at
[1:11:27] these beautiful stories of the Old
[1:11:29] Testament and we see the truths that are
[1:11:33] woven into these stories that are very
[1:11:37] applicable for the day day and hour in
[1:11:39] which we live for our lives today. Help
[1:11:42] us today to stand. May we have courage.
[1:11:48] May we have strength. May we not be
[1:11:51] powders that do without, but may we be
[1:11:54] those who stand on the promises of the
[1:11:57] word of God, protecting the truth and
[1:12:01] protecting our heritage from those who
[1:12:04] would like to squander it out of our
[1:12:06] hands. And we will give you glory,
[1:12:09] honor, and much praise for it's in the
[1:12:11] name of the Lord Jesus Christ, Yeshua,
[1:12:13] our Messiah, that we pray. And the
[1:12:16] saints said, "Amen." You may be seated.
[1:12:19] But
[1:12:20] Jezebel his wife came to him. That's a
[1:12:24] familiar name.
[1:12:29] Jezebel. You know her, don't you? Yes.
[1:12:33] But Jezebel his wife came to him and
[1:12:36] said unto him, "Why is thy spirit so sad
[1:12:41] that thou eatest no bread?"
[1:12:44] And he said unto her,
[1:12:46] because I would like to do it in a whiny
[1:12:49] voice, but I won't, because I spake unto
[1:12:53] Nabboth the Jezraelite, and said unto
[1:12:55] him, Give me thy vineyard for money, or
[1:12:58] else if it pleas thee, I will give thee
[1:13:00] another vineyard for it. And he
[1:13:03] answered, I will not give thee my
[1:13:09] vineyard. Does anybody like that? I like
[1:13:12] it.
[1:13:14] I am not for sale. My vineyard is not
[1:13:18] for sale. My heritage is not for sale. I
[1:13:23] don't care who you are and how much
[1:13:25] money you have. It's not for sale. I'll
[1:13:29] not give it to you. So don't even ask
[1:13:33] for it again. And Jezebel, you know, she
[1:13:37] said unto him, "Don't you know who you
[1:13:39] are?
[1:13:41] Have you forgotten who you
[1:13:43] are? Don't you know that you govern the
[1:13:47] kingdom of
[1:13:49] Israel? Arise and eat
[1:13:52] bread, have your supper, and let your
[1:13:55] heart be merry because Jezie is going to
[1:14:00] take care of it for you. Are you
[1:14:03] following me?
[1:14:05] This is a name I use very often if I'm
[1:14:08] uh uh operating a
[1:14:10] GPS because I call that female
[1:14:14] voice telling me recalculating
[1:14:17] recalculate. I call her Jezebel by
[1:14:21] name. You just let Jezebel fix this for
[1:14:26] you.
[1:14:27] I want you to see this grown man, king
[1:14:30] of Israel, and his wife is going to take
[1:14:34] care of things for him. I'll you don't
[1:14:37] get your hands dirty because I'll I'll
[1:14:40] dirty my hands because I love you so
[1:14:43] much. You're so amazing. Don't you fall
[1:14:45] for that. She wasn't doing it for Ahab.
[1:14:49] She already had a plan. She was a wicked
[1:14:53] woman from the start.
[1:14:55] She was a Phoenician. And Ahab had no
[1:14:59] business marrying a Phoenician.
[1:15:02] He had no business marrying someone from
[1:15:05] another nation because God had been very
[1:15:09] specific and very calculated in his
[1:15:13] instruction not to take wives of other
[1:15:17] lands of other nations because he knew
[1:15:20] that Israel alone had been given a
[1:15:23] spiritual heritage and only a true
[1:15:26] Israelite would fight hard to keep that
[1:15:29] heritage protected. If you own a
[1:15:32] business, you can't really expect your
[1:15:34] employees to care about it and protect
[1:15:37] it and fight for it the way that you do
[1:15:40] because their interest is a weekly
[1:15:43] paycheck. Your interest is your whole
[1:15:45] future is tied up in it. Your home is
[1:15:48] tied up in it and everything you you
[1:15:51] treasure is tied up in it. And so no one
[1:15:54] is going to care about it like you. And
[1:15:57] and that is the reality here. Uh, it it
[1:16:00] meant something to Ahab. I I'd like to
[1:16:04] plant some herbs, but it didn't mean as
[1:16:06] much to Ahab as it meant to Nabboth
[1:16:10] because Nabboth's father had worked in
[1:16:12] that vineyard and had enjoyed the fruit
[1:16:15] of it. His grandfather, his
[1:16:17] greatgrandfather, his great great great
[1:16:22] greatgrandfather. It goes all the way,
[1:16:24] How do you know that? because it goes
[1:16:26] all the way back to the dividing of the
[1:16:28] land of Canaan. Each portion given to a
[1:16:31] tribe, one of the 12 tribes of Israel.
[1:16:35] And so we know that according to the
[1:16:37] scripture, it couldn't be sold. And so
[1:16:40] we can trace it all the way back to the
[1:16:42] dividing under the leadership of the
[1:16:44] prophet Moses. And his family had been
[1:16:47] on that land for generation after
[1:16:49] generation after generation. So, uh, it
[1:16:52] might have been a prime location for
[1:16:55] King Ahab, but for Nabboth, it
[1:16:59] represented the blood and the sweat and
[1:17:02] the tears and the care of his
[1:17:05] generations before him. He wanted his
[1:17:09] sons and his grandsons and his
[1:17:13] greatgrandsons and his great great great
[1:17:16] great grandsons to eat grapes and drink
[1:17:20] wine from that vineyard. In fact, he
[1:17:24] wanted it to be a perpetual
[1:17:26] uh contract as God had made it that it
[1:17:30] would always pass from generation to
[1:17:33] generation. Uh, so it was more valuable
[1:17:36] to Nabboth than a few herbs to King
[1:17:40] Ahab. You see, what you value, you'll
[1:17:44] give yourself to. What you value, you'll
[1:17:47] fight for.
[1:17:50] What you value, you might even die for.
[1:17:54] What you value, you'll stand up for.
[1:17:56] You'll be bold. You'll be courageous
[1:17:59] for. Anybody listening this morning?
[1:18:02] Uh it's very important that we
[1:18:04] understand what was going on in this
[1:18:07] struggle. Now we're in a series on
[1:18:10] manipulation and the next time that we
[1:18:13] are together pro perhaps Tuesday night
[1:18:15] or next Sunday we'll go into that part
[1:18:17] of the story. That's where I thought we
[1:18:19] would be this morning. How Jezebel began
[1:18:22] to you know uh navigate herself. She she
[1:18:28] began to work her magic.
[1:18:31] You know, I see her. I'm sorry. I I
[1:18:33] guess it sounds as though I have a real
[1:18:35] axe to grind with Jezebel. Well, I do.
[1:18:39] Uh because, you know, if if her death
[1:18:42] would have ended at all, that would have
[1:18:44] been all right. But the reality is what
[1:18:46] she carried is a spirit. We understand
[1:18:50] from the words of Jesus.
[1:18:52] what she carried is a spirit that the
[1:18:54] church and especially the bride church
[1:18:57] is is having to struggle against even in
[1:19:00] this hour. It's a controlling spirit.
[1:19:03] It's a spirit of manipulation and it's a
[1:19:06] genderless spirit. So don't you think
[1:19:08] that only women can operate in a spirit
[1:19:11] of Jezebel because a man can as well. a
[1:19:15] spirit of control and manipulation
[1:19:18] especially when it when it mixes in
[1:19:20] religion and
[1:19:22] spirituality. You can say that it's
[1:19:24] under the opice of that kind of spirit
[1:19:27] that Jezebel was was dealing with and
[1:19:31] operated in. Now let me just read these
[1:19:34] verses although we won't go very far
[1:19:36] into them this morning because the Lord
[1:19:38] is taking us in a slightly different
[1:19:40] direction than planned. But let's get
[1:19:42] the rest of this in. Aren't you the
[1:19:45] king? In verse seven, aren't you the
[1:19:48] one? Don't you have control? Now you
[1:19:52] just take it easy. Verse eight. So she
[1:19:55] she wrote
[1:19:59] letters. She became a forger.
[1:20:03] She wrote letters. She was operating in
[1:20:07] illegitimate authority.
[1:20:10] When you put someone else's name on
[1:20:13] something where you have no investment
[1:20:16] and no authority, no law to back you up,
[1:20:19] but you just write in someone else's
[1:20:22] name and you start conducting business
[1:20:24] on their behalf, it's a felony
[1:20:28] and you can go to prison for it. And uh
[1:20:32] if if he would have given her
[1:20:34] permission, perhaps there wouldn't have
[1:20:36] been a
[1:20:37] problem. We understand how things
[1:20:39] operate because we just had a period of
[1:20:42] time in our
[1:20:44] nation where uh you know perhaps some
[1:20:48] sort of uh computer or something some
[1:20:51] automatic pin of some kind was was
[1:20:54] signing laws and making changes and
[1:20:57] doing all kinds of things that we're now
[1:20:59] finding out that our our president at
[1:21:02] the time really had no knowledge of what
[1:21:06] all was going on in his name. It didn't
[1:21:08] matter because he was sort of living in
[1:21:10] his own little world, you know, as we do
[1:21:12] when we get in that condition.
[1:21:15] And so there were many people, I don't
[1:21:17] know if it'll ever come out, but it
[1:21:19] appears from what I'm hearing in the
[1:21:21] news this week, it appears that many
[1:21:23] people are culpable in this. And many
[1:21:26] people have have conducted business in
[1:21:28] the name of the president and in the
[1:21:30] name of our nation who really in
[1:21:32] themselves had no authority to do such.
[1:21:35] Jezebel tried it. She did it. She said,
[1:21:38] "I'll just write some letters, sign the
[1:21:40] king's name, seal them with his seal and
[1:21:43] send the letters unto the elders and
[1:21:45] unto the nobles that were in his city
[1:21:48] dwelling with Neabboth. I'm going to
[1:21:51] tell him a thing or two and do it in the
[1:21:53] name of the king." And she wrote in the
[1:21:55] letter, "Say, proclaim a fast." Now,
[1:21:58] here is where illegitimate stolen
[1:22:02] political authority becomes
[1:22:05] illegitimate, stolen religious
[1:22:07] authority. Now, for some of you, that
[1:22:10] should sound like Revelation
[1:22:12] 13 because that is what is promised in
[1:22:15] the end time that the political spirit
[1:22:19] of Rome will emerge. It will morph
[1:22:22] itself into the religious authority of
[1:22:25] Rome. And when that papo that that
[1:22:29] political and that papo when those
[1:22:31] things begin to come together natural
[1:22:34] authority and spiritual authority then
[1:22:36] there are two beast on the scene and one
[1:22:40] of those beasts the scripture tells us
[1:22:41] in Revelation 13 is two horned like a
[1:22:45] lamb and we understand because of not
[1:22:49] only brother Brandon but others before
[1:22:51] him who also had the understanding that
[1:22:54] there is another creature that has two
[1:22:57] horns, short horns like a little like a
[1:23:00] lamb and that is a
[1:23:02] buffalo. And so we understand
[1:23:05] prophetically that in Revelation chapter
[1:23:07] 13 we see the United States of America
[1:23:10] in symbol form. So don't ever come under
[1:23:14] that uh dispensational lie that America
[1:23:17] is not represented in the scripture.
[1:23:19] Indeed she is. And that is in Revelation
[1:23:22] chapter 13. And in that chapter again it
[1:23:25] talks about the merging together of of
[1:23:29] political and religion. When you have uh
[1:23:34] policy that is uh empowered by false
[1:23:38] religion. False policy empowered by
[1:23:42] false religion. No wonder it was a beast
[1:23:44] this time rising up out of the land and
[1:23:47] not out of the sea. How many of you
[1:23:49] follow and you're familiar? If you're
[1:23:51] not, go home and read Revelation chapter
[1:23:53] 13. You'll find it very interesting. So
[1:23:56] now she starts using
[1:23:57] religion. And she said fast. I I want to
[1:24:02] call a fast in the land. I not only am
[1:24:06] doing this in the name of my husband.
[1:24:08] I'm going to say we should have the
[1:24:10] nobles and the elders missing meals and
[1:24:14] you know sort of dedicating themselves
[1:24:18] for what the future holds.
[1:24:21] Proclaim a fast and set Nabboth on high.
[1:24:25] Elevate him. This is how the enemy
[1:24:27] works. He raises them
[1:24:31] up so he can cut them down. This is how
[1:24:34] the spirit of Jezebel works. She raises
[1:24:37] up a
[1:24:39] leader so that she can emasculate him.
[1:24:45] So that she can chop him off. It's
[1:24:48] bigger than our little dynamic
[1:24:51] relationships.
[1:24:53] We're talking about a world power.
[1:24:56] We're talking about a woman power
[1:24:59] because that's what is the church is
[1:25:01] represented by a woman. We're talking
[1:25:03] about at the same time that a true
[1:25:06] church begins to move into the fullness
[1:25:08] of who she is, here comes a false church
[1:25:12] rising up and uh I mean totally changing
[1:25:17] the the continuity of
[1:25:20] scripture. I've been studying a little
[1:25:22] bit again on the on the councils of the
[1:25:27] church and the nyine council is not the
[1:25:30] only one. It's ridiculously hard reading
[1:25:35] to try to go through it. And at the end
[1:25:38] of it, you sort of recognize that even
[1:25:40] they didn't understand the the mystery
[1:25:42] of the Holy Trinity.
[1:25:45] They were still trying to figure it all
[1:25:47] out. And sometimes what they said really
[1:25:51] didn't mean that much. It just simply
[1:25:53] meant we don't really know. We're just
[1:25:56] keeping all of our doors open. How many
[1:25:58] of you know that's not revelation?
[1:26:00] You you you can't vote on vote and
[1:26:03] decide what the truth is. The truth is
[1:26:05] not what the majority votes on. The
[1:26:07] truth is what the Holy Ghost says the
[1:26:09] word means. That's where revelation
[1:26:12] comes in. And uh what I did what I did
[1:26:15] learn is something that I should have
[1:26:17] known. I may have known, but I I don't
[1:26:19] think it ever became a reality to me.
[1:26:22] And that is I discovered with a little
[1:26:24] nudging from the Lord that that what we
[1:26:28] use the term person the way we use the
[1:26:32] word person it's not the way the word
[1:26:35] person was used uh in the time of the
[1:26:38] Ning council. It meant something
[1:26:39] entirely different. And so when they
[1:26:42] began to use this language for persons,
[1:26:45] they were not expressing what we now
[1:26:49] understand three persons of the Godhead
[1:26:51] means. They were expressing something in
[1:26:54] the beginning much more similar to how
[1:26:57] you and I would see the Godhead. But the
[1:27:00] reality is when words begin to change
[1:27:03] and the meanings and definitions of
[1:27:05] words begin to change and when the
[1:27:08] church began to see that some were
[1:27:11] straying off into other ideas, they
[1:27:15] began to then also redefine what a
[1:27:19] person was. And we see what's really
[1:27:23] important to know in church history as
[1:27:25] we we see the church becoming more
[1:27:28] dogmatic and more dogmatic and more
[1:27:30] dogmatic to meet the times.
[1:27:34] And the next thing you know, you've got
[1:27:36] a doctrine over here that's nothing like
[1:27:39] scripture. And yet the church keeps
[1:27:41] voting it in. Aren't you glad you're not
[1:27:44] under that spirit? Aren't you glad
[1:27:46] you're not under that system? Aren't you
[1:27:49] glad you know who Jesus is? Aren't you
[1:27:52] glad you have a revelation that Jesus of
[1:27:55] the New Testament is Jehovah of the Old
[1:27:57] Testament? And there are not three
[1:28:00] persons in the Godhead. There is one
[1:28:03] person
[1:28:05] and his name is Jesus Christ. Are you
[1:28:08] denying the Father? Absolutely not. I
[1:28:11] know he's real. Jesus said, "When you've
[1:28:13] seen me, you've seen him." Are you
[1:28:16] denying the Holy Ghost? Oh, never,
[1:28:19] never, never, never. Because I know
[1:28:20] where the Holy Ghost is at any given
[1:28:23] moment of the day or the hour. Where in
[1:28:26] me? He can be in you, too, if he's not.
[1:28:30] So, yes, I believe in him. But I I
[1:28:33] started doing some research into the art
[1:28:35] of the church. You wouldn't be
[1:28:37] interested, but you'll probably see some
[1:28:39] of it anyway. And even the way the
[1:28:42] artists of the Catholic Church began to
[1:28:45] paint the Godhead and how it got more
[1:28:47] extreme and more extreme and more
[1:28:49] extreme. In the beginning when they
[1:28:51] started making illustrations to uh to
[1:28:54] show the Trinity, it was blurred. There
[1:28:58] were three blurred
[1:29:00] faces. And of course, it was the face of
[1:29:03] Jesus that was sort of blurred into
[1:29:05] three different little images. You
[1:29:06] follow? I'll have to show it to you
[1:29:08] sometime. before they got through.
[1:29:11] You've got three separate Jesus's
[1:29:14] sitting on three separate thrones.
[1:29:17] Do you understand how a lie just gets
[1:29:20] bigger and bigger and bigger when you
[1:29:22] put a political and a religious spirit
[1:29:23] behind it? That's right. So, there was
[1:29:26] even a development in the idea of the
[1:29:30] Trinity. And I only mention that because
[1:29:33] it's been in my studies and because I
[1:29:36] see that Jezebel was sort of forerunning
[1:29:39] that idea of putting uh king and church
[1:29:45] together, the authority of the political
[1:29:48] arena and the authority of the religious
[1:29:51] arena. So she is proclaiming a fast and
[1:29:54] she is deciding in Ahab's name that
[1:29:57] Nabboth is to be elevated among the
[1:29:59] people. Are you still following me?
[1:30:02] Good. I'm very glad. Let me read on just
[1:30:04] a few more verses. That was that verse
[1:30:07] nine. And she set two men. And look at
[1:30:11] who she chose. Sons of
[1:30:14] Balile. She chose two men serving the
[1:30:18] devil. She chose them and set them
[1:30:21] before him to bear witness against him,
[1:30:24] saying, "Thou didest blasphe God and the
[1:30:26] king." and then carry him out and stone
[1:30:29] him that he may die. What was Neabboth's
[1:30:34] crime? Not for
[1:30:37] sale. His crime was not squandering his
[1:30:42] heritage.
[1:30:44] His crime was not giving in to the
[1:30:47] trend.
[1:30:50] His crime was deciding to stay with what
[1:30:53] he believed, what his convictions were.
[1:30:56] And you'll find out in a minute.
[1:30:58] According to God's word, he was standing
[1:31:00] on the word. So now she is plotting an
[1:31:04] assassination. Let's read on. I'll I'll
[1:31:07] try to stay on subject. And the men of
[1:31:09] the city of his city, even the elders
[1:31:12] and the nobles who were the inhabitants
[1:31:14] in letters which he had sent unto them.
[1:31:17] Did I skip
[1:31:19] something? They proclaimed a fast and
[1:31:22] set neabboth on high among the people.
[1:31:26] That was verse 12. And there came in two
[1:31:28] men, children of Balile, and sat before
[1:31:30] him. And the men of Balile, witnessed
[1:31:32] against him, even against Nabboth, in
[1:31:35] the presence of the people, saying,
[1:31:37] Nabboth did blasphe God and the king.
[1:31:40] Then they carried him forth out of the
[1:31:43] city. Boy, this escalated in a hurry.
[1:31:47] That's what happens when Jezebel says,
[1:31:49] "Don't you worry about it, honey. I'll
[1:31:52] take care of it. Don't you get yourself
[1:31:54] in a tither. I'll take care of it,
[1:31:58] darling. You just rest and let sweetie
[1:32:02] take care of it. That's what happens. It
[1:32:05] escalated very fast and now they're
[1:32:08] carrying carrying him out and stoning
[1:32:11] him with stones that he died. He's been
[1:32:16] murdered. And his only crime was, "My
[1:32:21] vineyard is not for sale. It belongs to
[1:32:24] me. It belongs to my family. And I'm
[1:32:27] going to live on it and die on it." That
[1:32:30] was his crime. It cost him his life.
[1:32:34] There may come an hour that your faith
[1:32:37] will cost you yours.
[1:32:41] There may come a day that my faith would
[1:32:44] cost me mine. You better know what you
[1:32:47] believe. You better believe what you
[1:32:50] believe. You better be willing to both
[1:32:53] live for what you believe and die for
[1:32:56] what you believe. Come on. Sometimes you
[1:33:00] have to stand up against the system and
[1:33:02] say, "I'm not for sale. I don't care if
[1:33:05] everybody else goes back to the beggarly
[1:33:07] elements of the world. I am not for
[1:33:09] sale. I don't care if holiness is
[1:33:12] outlawed, out outdated, out antiquated,
[1:33:16] laughed at, made fun of, mocked. I don't
[1:33:19] care if I'm called a pilgrim or Amish or
[1:33:21] whatever they say about me. I'm going to
[1:33:23] stay with the word. That may cost you
[1:33:26] your life. You better know. You better
[1:33:29] get everything settled in this hour
[1:33:31] because those powers are joining
[1:33:33] together forming an image.
[1:33:36] They're forming an image under that
[1:33:38] beast false prophet ready to operate on
[1:33:42] the scene to take us another
[1:33:44] installment. Now, we know there's
[1:33:47] something standing between the fullness
[1:33:49] of that and that is there is going to be
[1:33:51] a rapture. Don't ever doubt the fact
[1:33:55] that the scriptures are clear. There is
[1:33:58] a people that are not appointed under
[1:34:00] wrath. The Bible said. So you may have a
[1:34:03] revelation that as I do that I'm one of
[1:34:05] those not appointed unto wrath. So I'm
[1:34:09] not experiencing those last three and a
[1:34:11] half years of tribulation.
[1:34:14] We know that Messiah's ministry was cut
[1:34:17] off in the middle of the week. And we
[1:34:20] know that there is a great tribulation
[1:34:23] period, uh, three and a half years that
[1:34:26] are yet to befall the earth. I think
[1:34:29] most people don't even want to think
[1:34:30] about it, much less hear it in church
[1:34:33] when they come on Sunday. Everything
[1:34:36] can't be feel good.
[1:34:38] I want you to know it wasn't all feel
[1:34:40] good for Nabboth. Before he knew it, he
[1:34:43] was lied on, testified against,
[1:34:46] sentenced
[1:34:48] and pounded to death for nothing
[1:34:53] except not for sale.
[1:34:57] My children may not understand it. My
[1:34:59] neighbor may not understand it for
[1:35:01] crying out loud. My spouse may not
[1:35:03] understand it. But I know what I
[1:35:05] believe.
[1:35:08] I know what the word said. I'm not for
[1:35:10] sale. It It can be the price of
[1:35:13] conviction sometime to stand against the
[1:35:16] tide. You just let them roll by. You
[1:35:19] just let the world push. You let the
[1:35:22] world shove. You let the enemy try to
[1:35:24] talk you out of your conviction. If you
[1:35:26] follow the trends around this message,
[1:35:29] you'll follow them right into compromise
[1:35:32] and sin.
[1:35:34] They're doing today what they preached
[1:35:36] against 30 years ago. We are now
[1:35:40] becoming exactly like the systems that
[1:35:43] we have despised. You don't have to say
[1:35:46] amen. I will. Amen, brother.
[1:35:50] And if you think it's going to get
[1:35:51] better, it'll not get better for the
[1:35:54] majority. It's only get going to get
[1:35:56] better for the Neabboths. Somebody said
[1:35:59] stoning
[1:36:00] him. That was the better the better of
[1:36:03] the two. Yes, it actually was for him.
[1:36:06] It was a shortcut. to the fullness of
[1:36:09] who God had created him to be. You see,
[1:36:11] time was ending for Neabboth. But
[1:36:13] eternity was just unfolding. Are you
[1:36:16] with me? I appreciate it very much. So,
[1:36:20] he
[1:36:21] died. I I mean, this is
[1:36:24] terrible. Then they sent to Jezebel
[1:36:27] saying, "Nabboth is stoned and
[1:36:31] dead. You your your plan worked." And it
[1:36:34] came to pass when Jezebel heard that
[1:36:36] Nabboth was stoned and was dead, that
[1:36:38] Jezebel said to Ahab, "Arise, take
[1:36:40] possession of the vineyard of Nabboth
[1:36:42] the Jezraelite, which he refused to give
[1:36:44] thee for money, for Nabboth is not
[1:36:46] alive, but dead." And it came to pass
[1:36:50] when Ahab heard that Nabboth was dead,
[1:36:52] that Ahab rose up to go down to the
[1:36:54] vineyard of Nabboth the Jezraelite, to
[1:36:57] take possession of it. Bless his little
[1:36:59] heart.
[1:37:00] He got out of bed, ate his cracker and
[1:37:02] and and cookie and drank his uh Kool-Aid
[1:37:06] and decided, I'm going to go look over
[1:37:09] what what is now mine. And how much did
[1:37:12] it cost
[1:37:13] him? Financially nothing.
[1:37:16] Financially nothing. He didn't have to
[1:37:18] trade for it. He didn't have to shell
[1:37:21] out any silver for it. But in reality,
[1:37:23] it cost him everything.
[1:37:26] Because if I would read the next verse,
[1:37:28] I'm not going to. I'll do that Tuesday
[1:37:30] night or Sunday. But if I would read the
[1:37:32] next verse, you know what it says? And
[1:37:33] the word of the Lord came unto Elijah
[1:37:35] the prophet, "Go tell Ahab."
[1:37:38] Not a week went by.
[1:37:41] Not a month went by, but the word of the
[1:37:44] Lord came to the prophet right away. You
[1:37:48] get down and tell that king, "I saw what
[1:37:51] he laid down and let happen. I saw it. I
[1:37:55] saw his yellow belly. I saw his lily
[1:37:58] liver.
[1:38:00] I saw his weak wishbone instead of a
[1:38:04] backbone. And now I'm going to deal with
[1:38:06] it. I'm going to wipe out his the
[1:38:09] future, the the heritage that he wanted
[1:38:12] to pass. I'm going to get it. And when
[1:38:14] I'm done, I'm going after her, too.
[1:38:21] The dogs are going to come and lick the
[1:38:22] blood.
[1:38:24] That's right. And as brother Brandham
[1:38:26] said, she's going to become Mrs. Dog
[1:38:28] meat. That's right. The dogs are going
[1:38:30] to eat the queen.
[1:38:32] Why? Because those that she uh, you
[1:38:35] know, brought mutilation to, I'm not
[1:38:37] going into that. They were the very ones
[1:38:40] that pushed her into her judgment. Throw
[1:38:42] her
[1:38:44] down. I don't want to devalue her life,
[1:38:48] but I want to tell you something. God
[1:38:51] was very disturbed about the compromise
[1:38:55] that had already taken place in the land
[1:38:57] of Israel.
[1:38:59] Now I want us to move on into this. In a
[1:39:02] world where
[1:39:04] compromise is
[1:39:06] normalized and conviction is
[1:39:09] rare. The story of Neabboth stands both
[1:39:13] as a warning and a witness. Are you with
[1:39:17] me? If I felt you, I wouldn't keep
[1:39:19] asking. Come on.
[1:39:21] Ahab wanted a vineyard, but Nabboth
[1:39:24] refused to sell it to him because for
[1:39:26] Nabboth, it was more than a piece of
[1:39:28] dirt. For him, it was a spiritual
[1:39:33] inheritance, not just a piece of
[1:39:35] property. I want us to know who Nabboth
[1:39:38] is. Nabboth was a righteous Jezraelite.
[1:39:41] Look this way. A righteous Jezraelite
[1:39:44] who owned a vineyard right near the
[1:39:46] palace of Ahab. He understood and
[1:39:50] respected the law of Moses regarding
[1:39:53] family inheritance. Can I read that to
[1:39:55] you quickly? It's just two verses.
[1:39:57] Leviticus 25:23. The land shall not be
[1:40:01] sold forever. For the land is mine.
[1:40:07] Who's talking? God's talking. This isn't
[1:40:11] Moses talking. This is God talking.
[1:40:13] Yeah, I'm I'm giving you this land as an
[1:40:16] inheritance. But you need to know that
[1:40:18] at the end of the day, the land is mine
[1:40:20] and you are not to sell it.
[1:40:23] For you are just strangers and sojourers
[1:40:25] with me in this land. It doesn't really
[1:40:28] belong to you. It belongs to me. That's
[1:40:30] pretty big. Nabboth knew that word.
[1:40:32] Nabboth had lived and and eventually
[1:40:35] died for that word. Now, Numbers 36:7 in
[1:40:39] the Amplified says, "So shall no
[1:40:41] inheritance of the Israelites be
[1:40:44] transferred from tribe to tribe. For
[1:40:47] every one of the Israelites shall cling
[1:40:50] to the inheritance of the tribe of his
[1:40:53] fathers." Do you understand that Nabboth
[1:40:56] wasn't just a stubborn man? He was a
[1:40:59] righteous man. He wasn't just a stick in
[1:41:02] the mud. He was a godly man. He was a
[1:41:05] man who feared and honored and respected
[1:41:07] the word of the Lord. Don't you
[1:41:09] appreciate that about Nabboth. He wasn't
[1:41:12] just trying to be ugly. He didn't just
[1:41:14] try to disrespect the king meant a whole
[1:41:17] lot more. He symbolized by his action a
[1:41:20] righteous remnant who refused to sell
[1:41:23] out. Brother, you better be part of that
[1:41:26] remnant as we go through 2025. Not for
[1:41:30] sale. Not for sale. Not for sale. I
[1:41:34] don't care how they paint.
[1:41:38] I don't care how they pri. I don't care
[1:41:41] what the church does. That's between
[1:41:43] them and the Lord, but for me and my
[1:41:45] house.
[1:41:48] Yes, sir. Amen. Not for sale.
[1:41:51] Not for sale. I I I've seen long enough.
[1:41:55] 50 years of
[1:41:57] preaching. I have now seen what little
[1:42:02] compromises can accomplish
[1:42:05] with truth.
[1:42:07] You water it down. You you you dress it
[1:42:10] up. You explain it away until it becomes
[1:42:15] smaller and smaller and smaller. One
[1:42:18] generation barely values a truth and the
[1:42:23] next generation ignores that truth as
[1:42:27] though it never existed and then the
[1:42:29] next generation preaches against
[1:42:34] the first generation who preached that
[1:42:36] it was sin in the first place.
[1:42:40] Anybody with me? Good. Now let's look at
[1:42:44] Ahab quickly. Who's Ahab? King of
[1:42:46] Israel. married to Jezebel, weak
[1:42:49] willed,
[1:42:56] passive,
[1:42:58] spoiled,
[1:43:00] entitled,
[1:43:02] covetous,
[1:43:04] envious, jealous. He desired Nabbos's
[1:43:07] vineyard for a garden of herbs. Bless
[1:43:10] his heart. Just buy him some at the
[1:43:12] grocery store so that he didn't have to
[1:43:14] steal somebody's vineyard. It wasn't a
[1:43:16] garden. It was a vineyard. Trivalizing
[1:43:19] spiritual heritage for carnal comfort.
[1:43:22] That's what Ahab did. What's it matter?
[1:43:24] He knew. Listen, here's the terrible uh
[1:43:27] reality is that Ahab knew the same word.
[1:43:33] He knew the same covenant that Nabboth
[1:43:35] knew. He knew what God had said in
[1:43:38] Leviticus. He knew what God had said in
[1:43:40] Numbers. But all he knew right now was
[1:43:43] he wanted an herb garden. Bless his
[1:43:44] little heart.
[1:43:47] And then meet
[1:43:48] Jezebel. Told you already something
[1:43:51] about her. She was a Phoenician
[1:43:53] princess. She was daughter of King
[1:43:56] Ethel.
[1:43:58] Ethl. Anybody know anything about the
[1:44:01] name Bel? Pagan god.
[1:44:04] High priest of Baal. Her father both
[1:44:08] king and high priest of Baal. A false
[1:44:11] god. Jezebel brings the worship of Bael
[1:44:15] into
[1:44:16] Israel. She was a master manipulator who
[1:44:19] embodies the spirit of control cloaked
[1:44:22] in religious language. She spiritualizes
[1:44:26] her manipulation. Don't you let somebody
[1:44:28] do you that way?
[1:44:30] Don't you let somebody use God's name or
[1:44:33] scripture or a quote
[1:44:37] to manipulate you.
[1:44:40] That's wrong. That's not how we teach.
[1:44:45] That's not how we help. That's not how
[1:44:47] we build up. Amen. Don't Don't use reli
[1:44:51] Don't weaponize religion to settle an
[1:44:54] argument at your house. Hello.
[1:44:58] You know, don't triangulate and pull
[1:45:00] Brother Brandham in on it.
[1:45:04] Let's leave him at peace beyond the
[1:45:05] curtain of time. Don't drag him into the
[1:45:07] living room. Well, you know, Brother
[1:45:09] Brandham said, in fact, that ought not
[1:45:11] to be your first thought anyway.
[1:45:15] Your first thought ought to be, "What
[1:45:17] does the Bible say?" We teach the word
[1:45:19] to our families. We must do that, but we
[1:45:22] don't use it to beat them.
[1:45:26] How many of you believe you can use the
[1:45:27] Bible and destroy somebody? That's not
[1:45:29] what we we cannot afford to operate
[1:45:32] under that spirit.
[1:45:34] The name Jezebel carries profound
[1:45:38] spiritual significance that goes far
[1:45:40] beyond the actual etmology of the word
[1:45:43] in Hebrew. Is Isel
[1:45:47] is likely means where is the
[1:45:52] prince? What a strange meaning for a
[1:45:56] name. Where is the prince? That's a good
[1:45:59] question.
[1:46:02] That's a good question. Maybe you're
[1:46:05] carrying him around in your purse. We
[1:46:07] don't know where the prince is
[1:46:09] either. All we know is he's not doing
[1:46:12] his job. That's the meaning of her name.
[1:46:15] It it also means not
[1:46:18] exalted. Not much interested, isn't it?
[1:46:23] She had no business queen of Israel.
[1:46:27] She had no business queen of the divided
[1:46:30] uh portion of Israel that we know as
[1:46:31] Samaria. She had no business being in
[1:46:34] the palace at
[1:46:35] all. But Ahab made that decision.
[1:46:39] So when we look at the meaning of her
[1:46:41] name, we understand that the biblical
[1:46:42] narrative transforms her name into
[1:46:45] something much more ominous than than
[1:46:47] just where is the
[1:46:49] prince. It actually means something even
[1:46:52] more. The the biblical symbolism of
[1:46:55] Jezebel has become the
[1:46:58] embodiment of a specific demonic
[1:47:00] influence that operates through both
[1:47:03] seduction and manipulation.
[1:47:06] It's this sick twist.
[1:47:11] She appealed to the lustful spirit of
[1:47:15] her husband.
[1:47:17] Come on,
[1:47:19] darling. You need more than a back rub.
[1:47:22] You need that. You need that vineyard.
[1:47:25] You
[1:47:27] understand? The sliminess of combining
[1:47:31] seduction and manipulation is filthy in
[1:47:34] the eyes of God. It should have no part
[1:47:37] in godly relationships. If you
[1:47:40] understand what I'm saying, say amen.
[1:47:42] Amen. So yes, she was the Phoenician
[1:47:44] princess of the and the daughter of
[1:47:46] Ethmael who was the king of Siden and
[1:47:49] who was a high priest to to a false god
[1:47:52] before becoming
[1:47:54] king. Ethel was noted to have been a
[1:47:57] priest of
[1:47:59] Aarte. You remember that? Which was the
[1:48:02] Greek form of the moon goddess Ashtareth
[1:48:06] or Asteroth.
[1:48:08] You know that name very well because it
[1:48:10] is from a start that we get the name
[1:48:13] Easter.
[1:48:15] So these are goddesses of war. They are
[1:48:18] goddesses of seduction and
[1:48:21] sexuality. To read what the people
[1:48:24] believed about these goddesses, it's
[1:48:27] filthy. It's hard to get through it.
[1:48:30] Aarti is what the Phoenicians called
[1:48:32] her.
[1:48:34] uh this this goddess of fertility and
[1:48:38] sexuality and and war. She married King
[1:48:42] Ahab of Israel, bringing with her the
[1:48:44] worship of both Baal and another goddess
[1:48:49] whose name was
[1:48:51] Asher. And Asher is sometimes
[1:48:54] interchanged with with
[1:48:56] Ashtto or Aarte. These are actually not
[1:49:00] the same goddesses, although they are
[1:49:02] represented similarly in both mythology
[1:49:06] and in art, but they are distinct.
[1:49:10] Jezebel's very presence represented the
[1:49:12] infiltration of foreign
[1:49:15] gods into God's covenant nation to be
[1:49:19] honored, exonerated by God's covenant
[1:49:22] people. This is big business here. Oh
[1:49:24] Israel,
[1:49:26] the Lord thy God is one. Have no other
[1:49:29] gods before me, he says. And here Ahab
[1:49:33] in his
[1:49:34] lust has chosen a pagan wife with false
[1:49:38] gods, brought her right into the palace,
[1:49:41] and she's conducting business in the
[1:49:43] name of the kingdom.
[1:49:45] She wasn't content to worship her pagan
[1:49:47] deities privately. She systematically
[1:49:50] worked to eradicate the worship of
[1:49:51] Jehovah from Israel, killing God's
[1:49:54] prophets and establishing hundreds and
[1:49:57] hundreds of false prophets who would
[1:49:59] take their place. In fact, we find that
[1:50:01] in First Kings 18:19. Let's look at it.
[1:50:04] And I'm hurrying. Now therefore send and
[1:50:07] gathered to be all Israel unto Mount
[1:50:09] Carmel, and the prophets of Baal 450.
[1:50:13] and the prophets of the groves 400 which
[1:50:17] eat at Jezebel's table. What
[1:50:20] she's feeding them in the palace.
[1:50:24] These filthy gods who oversee
[1:50:29] orgies in the name of religion. Come on
[1:50:32] now.
[1:50:34] She brings these priests to the palace
[1:50:37] of the king of Israel who is supposed to
[1:50:40] be in covenant with the only true living
[1:50:43] God. She sets them around her table
[1:50:45] mocking the faith of the people and
[1:50:49] feeds them little dainties you know
[1:50:52] these
[1:50:53] bloodthirsty
[1:50:55] pagans
[1:50:57] celebrated in the name of oh let's see
[1:51:01] uh tolerance and
[1:51:04] inclusion
[1:51:07] you see that's part of that Jezebel
[1:51:09] spirit as well you you have no right you
[1:51:12] have no license to be unkind to anyone
[1:51:16] regardless of who they sleep with or how
[1:51:18] they live their life. You cannot be. You
[1:51:22] must show the light. You must love. We
[1:51:24] must love even when it's hard. We must
[1:51:28] do it. But we cannot compromise and
[1:51:31] celebrate what God calls an abomination.
[1:51:35] We can't vote for what God has called an
[1:51:38] abomination
[1:51:40] or we answer for it. Are you with me?
[1:51:43] You see these uh gods, these prophets of
[1:51:46] the groves, 400 of them sitting around
[1:51:49] Jezebel's table right next to 450 of the
[1:51:53] prophets of Baal. This is 850 false
[1:51:55] prophets and priests sitting at the
[1:51:57] king's table eating every day. My
[1:52:01] goodness, how terrible, how horrible
[1:52:04] this is. Well, in King James, it just
[1:52:07] tells us prophets of the groves. But if
[1:52:10] we look at that word groves, it it means
[1:52:13] something uh uh pretty serious. It's
[1:52:15] talking about the poles of Asher.
[1:52:19] Hurrying, the poles of
[1:52:22] Asher. These were sacred trees or sacred
[1:52:26] poles that stood near Canaanite
[1:52:29] religious locations. And most
[1:52:32] significant in demonstrating Israel's
[1:52:34] association with Asher w with were
[1:52:37] sacred trees
[1:52:39] uh there were biblical materials that
[1:52:42] describe Asher or Asherim in plural
[1:52:46] cultish objects that I can't
[1:52:49] mention that are associated with the
[1:52:52] goddess Asher. more than 50 times in the
[1:52:56] Hebrew Bible, we see the word grove or
[1:52:59] tree or something like this. Every time
[1:53:03] associated with pagan worship taking
[1:53:05] place in the forest, in the woods where
[1:53:08] these sacred
[1:53:10] trees were dedicated to the false gods
[1:53:14] and goddesses of fertility and
[1:53:17] sexuality. In some of these places of
[1:53:19] worship, false worship, the branches
[1:53:22] were cut off the trees so that it was
[1:53:24] just a living tree that looked more like
[1:53:26] a pole. And I don't think that most of
[1:53:30] you have to even wonder. Uh uh I I I
[1:53:34] would just say this. I don't like to be
[1:53:35] this um base, but just just for your
[1:53:39] information, this is the this is where
[1:53:42] the the whole idea and the development
[1:53:44] of a strippers pole came from. Yes. You
[1:53:47] understand?
[1:53:49] It's the serpentine snake like spirit
[1:53:54] that would cause a woman to twist her
[1:53:56] body around a pole and dance
[1:53:59] provocatively to a man. These are the
[1:54:01] kinds of things that were going on in
[1:54:03] the land of
[1:54:04] Israel because the king dared marry a
[1:54:08] woman who didn't have the same faith he
[1:54:11] had.
[1:54:12] And if it was just left up to us to
[1:54:14] decide, it'd be one thing. But God had
[1:54:16] already given specific instructions.
[1:54:19] How many of you know leadership is
[1:54:21] called to a higher standard.
[1:54:23] You can't behave like this.
[1:54:26] So these objects
[1:54:28] of you know I've told you the Canaanite
[1:54:32] the Canaanite um people the
[1:54:41] the it's
[1:54:43] terrible. I think I'll just leave it at
[1:54:48] that. Here's what brother Brandham had
[1:54:50] to say about this marriage quickly. Be
[1:54:52] certain of God. 1959, he said in
[1:54:55] paragraph 5, "And then in his wedding,"
[1:54:57] he's talking about the king Ahab.
[1:54:59] Instead of marrying among his own
[1:55:01] people, he went over and married a
[1:55:04] sinner, an idoltor, a worship of idols,
[1:55:09] he married Jezebel. And she was not a
[1:55:12] believer. I'll say she wasn't a believer
[1:55:15] and no believer. Let's hear this for the
[1:55:17] church. Let's hear this church. Let's
[1:55:18] hear this for ourselves. Let's hear this
[1:55:20] for our children. Let's hear this for
[1:55:22] our grandchildren. Let's make sure we
[1:55:24] get this right. There are no exceptions
[1:55:27] to this. It's clear. And no believer
[1:55:30] should ever marry an unbeliever under no
[1:55:33] circumstances should always marry
[1:55:36] believers. Somebody said, "Well, that
[1:55:38] was brother Brandham's opinion." No,
[1:55:41] it's what the word said.
[1:55:44] It's never a good idea. It's never
[1:55:46] permissible in the scripture.
[1:55:51] And if you need me to, I could just, you
[1:55:54] know, eventually call a parade of people
[1:55:55] to come and tell you why. Because
[1:55:58] they've been there, done that.
[1:56:00] Did they get through? Some of them got
[1:56:02] through. Some of them didn't make it
[1:56:03] through. Some of them couldn't hold it
[1:56:04] together.
[1:56:07] It's not a good idea.
[1:56:10] But Ahab had done this evil thing and no
[1:56:13] doubt but what Jezebel was a beautiful
[1:56:15] woman. Here we go. And he had fell for
[1:56:18] what she looked
[1:56:20] like instead of what she was.
[1:56:25] Brother Brandon was being
[1:56:27] polite. This was
[1:56:29] lust. Just base lust.
[1:56:34] It wasn't her
[1:56:35] face that he was so happy
[1:56:39] about. It was her her volume. It was
[1:56:42] her. You know, you
[1:56:45] know, you know how she did. The
[1:56:49] scripture tells us he fell for it. Just
[1:56:52] like Samson, hook, line, and sinker.
[1:56:56] I got to have that. She's mine. I want
[1:57:00] that. I don't care what she believes.
[1:57:03] how many false prophets she brings in my
[1:57:05] house to eat.
[1:57:08] I don't care how many false worship
[1:57:09] services she attends. Just got to have
[1:57:12] her. Got to have her. And she had
[1:57:15] brought verse uh paragraph 8. Uh he
[1:57:18] said, oh, paragraph 7, excuse me. And he
[1:57:21] had fell for what she looked like
[1:57:22] instead of what she was. So that's so
[1:57:24] many people make the same mistake to
[1:57:26] this day. Can you say amen? and she had
[1:57:28] brought idolatry uh in the nation among
[1:57:30] the people and the people the priests
[1:57:32] their ministers had fell victim to this
[1:57:34] great popular demand. Here we go. Here
[1:57:36] we
[1:57:39] go. This
[1:57:41] story of Neabboth's vineyard becomes a
[1:57:44] powerful metaphor for defending
[1:57:46] spiritual heritage because it wasn't
[1:57:49] just a natural vineyard that Nabboth was
[1:57:52] willing to die for. He said, "The Lord
[1:57:54] forbid me." And he was speaking
[1:57:56] scripturally, "Thus sayaeth the word."
[1:57:59] Nabboth understood something profound.
[1:58:02] His vineyard wasn't merely a piece of
[1:58:04] property, but it was a covenant
[1:58:06] inheritance, a tangible link to his
[1:58:10] fathers and to the promises that God had
[1:58:13] made to generations before him. When he
[1:58:16] refused to sell, he was essentially
[1:58:18] saying this belongs just to he he was
[1:58:21] essentially saying this belongs not just
[1:58:24] to me but to those who came before me
[1:58:28] and to those who will come after me. I
[1:58:31] am but a steward.
[1:58:33] You and I are stewards.
[1:58:36] We are guardians of this truth.
[1:58:42] We have to live for it. perhaps die for
[1:58:46] it. It parallels the importance of how
[1:58:50] God placed this burden on the apostle in
[1:58:54] the New Testament in Jude verse three.
[1:58:56] He it says, "Beloved," I'm going to read
[1:58:58] in the amplified to save time. I have
[1:59:00] both, but I'm if I was going to read it
[1:59:02] in in both, it would take a little extra
[1:59:04] time. So, let me just do in the
[1:59:05] amplified. Beloved, my whole concern was
[1:59:08] to write to you in regard to our common
[1:59:11] salvation. But I found it necessary and
[1:59:13] was impelled to write you and urgently
[1:59:16] appeal to and exhort you to contend for
[1:59:19] the faith which was once for all handed
[1:59:22] down to the saints. The faith which is
[1:59:25] that sum of Christian belief which was
[1:59:28] delivered verbally to the holy people of
[1:59:30] God. earnestly contending for the faith
[1:59:33] which was once delivered to the saints.
[1:59:36] This is sort of what Neabboth was
[1:59:39] prefiguring in the Old Testament. Like
[1:59:42] Neabboth's vineyard, our spiritual
[1:59:45] heritage, the doctrines, the practices
[1:59:48] and the truths that are passed down
[1:59:51] through generations isn't
[1:59:54] ours to dispose of at will. You don't
[1:59:58] get to vote it in and vote it out.
[2:00:00] Hello. I don't get to legislate it in
[2:00:03] and legislate it out. That's right. It's
[2:00:06] for the ages. God's word never changes.
[2:00:10] It stands true today. If I build again
[2:00:14] the things that I once tore down, I
[2:00:16] become myself a transgressor.
[2:00:19] The Lord forbid it that I should sell
[2:00:21] this piece of land to you. Nabboth's
[2:00:24] refusal wasn't mere stubbornness. It was
[2:00:26] spiritual stewardship. Yes. your desire
[2:00:30] to stay with the word, your desire to
[2:00:32] stay with the message when the message
[2:00:34] dovetales with the word because you have
[2:00:38] an obligation first to the Bible.
[2:00:45] If you hear brother Brandham uh
[2:00:48] perhaps by by mistake, by by slip of
[2:00:52] tongue, by whatever, if you should hear
[2:00:55] him say the Holy Ghost is the third
[2:00:57] person of the Trinity, you don't have to
[2:00:59] defend
[2:01:02] that. You don't have to call that thus
[2:01:04] sayaith the Lord.
[2:01:06] You don't have to call that inherent
[2:01:09] because that's not what the Bible says.
[2:01:12] You stand on the word and later you'll
[2:01:14] hear him saying it exactly like the word
[2:01:18] says it. And that's what you die for.
[2:01:22] Don't you die for someone's uh slip now
[2:01:25] or their mistake because humans can make
[2:01:28] them. I ought to know. I've made plenty
[2:01:32] of them. This piece of land represented
[2:01:34] a generational blessing, a covenant
[2:01:37] promise, a divine appointment that God
[2:01:39] had made with his people. The Israelites
[2:01:41] had to die. Generations of them had to
[2:01:44] die to get over to inherit that land.
[2:01:47] How dare Nabboth even consider giving up
[2:01:50] quickly,
[2:01:52] surrendering quickly what generations
[2:01:54] before him had died to inherit. It goes
[2:01:58] all the way back to the promise of God
[2:02:00] to Abraham in Elilan Morray at the top
[2:02:03] of northern Israel where God said, "Look
[2:02:05] at look out across there, Abraham. I'm
[2:02:08] giving it to your seed.
[2:02:11] I want you to see this land as far as
[2:02:14] you can see. It's yours.
[2:02:19] And missing from
[2:02:21] that was all it would take to get it.
[2:02:25] God just said, "I'm giving it to you."
[2:02:27] He didn't He didn't tell him in that
[2:02:29] particular moment, "You're going to die
[2:02:31] by the thousands
[2:02:33] to inherit it. You're going to have to
[2:02:35] fight giants to inherit it. You're going
[2:02:37] to have to drive out the inhabitants of
[2:02:39] the land.
[2:02:41] You're going to have to bring judgment
[2:02:43] on some of your own people. To be able
[2:02:45] to inherit that land. So, how dare a
[2:02:47] neb,
[2:02:51] you know, how dare a technical uh social
[2:02:55] media connected generation come around
[2:02:57] now and tell us that what we've stood on
[2:03:00] around this message is outdated and no
[2:03:02] longer relevant. If it's in the word,
[2:03:07] Amen. It's relevant. And when I say the
[2:03:11] word, I know I know that you may not
[2:03:13] understand. Let me be clear. When I'm
[2:03:16] telling you the word, when I say the
[2:03:17] word, when I say if it's in the word, I
[2:03:19] am referring to the scripture.
[2:03:22] That's what I'm talking about. You You
[2:03:24] might ask your
[2:03:26] preachers what they're talking about
[2:03:28] when they say it, but when you hear me
[2:03:30] say it, you'll need to know. I'm talking
[2:03:32] about the Bible, the scripture, what we
[2:03:35] live for, what we die for. It's not that
[2:03:37] I don't value the message of the hour. I
[2:03:39] value it with all my heart. I've lost as
[2:03:42] much as anybody has ever lost to believe
[2:03:44] it. And I'm not ashamed to believe it.
[2:03:46] I'm not ashamed to stand for it. But I
[2:03:49] am embarrassed
[2:03:50] by some of the ways it's being presented
[2:03:53] in this hour. I am embarrassed by it. I
[2:03:56] take it seriously. I weep over it. I
[2:03:59] shut the door of my office and I weep
[2:04:01] over it because I understand that it
[2:04:04] cannot stand alone.
[2:04:06] It has to stand on the absolute
[2:04:08] foundation of the ultimate.
[2:04:11] Brother Brandham said the Holy Bible is
[2:04:13] the absolute. In other places he said
[2:04:15] the Holy Bible, the Bible is the
[2:04:17] ultimate.
[2:04:18] [Applause]
[2:04:20] And we didn't want to be like Bereans.
[2:04:22] People didn't want to be like Bereans.
[2:04:24] They wanted everything handed to them
[2:04:25] and they wanted to be told what to
[2:04:27] believe.
[2:04:30] God wasn't looking for a church like
[2:04:32] that. He wanted a people that would do
[2:04:33] their homework. He wanted a people that
[2:04:36] would make their way through a series of
[2:04:38] sermons and find where it sits square on
[2:04:42] the foundation of the Bible.
[2:04:46] Preach that.
[2:04:49] We don't need three hours on the cloud.
[2:04:52] We need three hours on what Jesus
[2:04:55] desires to do in this hour to set
[2:04:59] captives free to bring people to a total
[2:05:02] deliverance.
[2:05:04] That's what he died for. He didn't die
[2:05:06] to protect a picture. He died to protect
[2:05:10] a truth, a reality, sir, that we're
[2:05:13] saved by grace through the blood of
[2:05:15] Jesus Christ. Oh, can you believe both?
[2:05:20] You absolutely can.
[2:05:22] You absolutely can. But when it comes
[2:05:24] time to place value, you must value the
[2:05:27] ultimate as the ultimate. The absolute
[2:05:30] is the absolute. If something is going
[2:05:32] to be your absolute, it must be perfect.
[2:05:42] Hello. The blood of Nabboth cries out as
[2:05:45] a reminder. Some things are worth
[2:05:46] defending unto death. Anybody agree? I
[2:05:49] want to explain heritage for you for
[2:05:51] just a moment. Heritage is the treasure
[2:05:54] chest of who you
[2:05:56] are. It's the stories, the values, the
[2:05:59] traditions, the wisdom that flow through
[2:06:01] your family like a fine thread
[2:06:04] connecting everything together. That's
[2:06:07] heritage. It's what you got from your
[2:06:09] grandpa and your grandpa's
[2:06:11] grandpa. It's all of it. It's
[2:06:13] grandmother's recipes
[2:06:16] that mama can cook and it smells like
[2:06:19] grandma's house because it's her
[2:06:22] recipe. It's eating someone else's cake
[2:06:25] and saying that's a delicious cake but
[2:06:27] knowing in your mind it'll never touch
[2:06:29] my big
[2:06:31] mama's. It's your
[2:06:34] heritage, your
[2:06:36] traditions. It's songs that were
[2:06:39] sung, sacred songs and silly songs. It's
[2:06:43] all right. It's hard one lessons passed
[2:06:46] down through generations who survived
[2:06:48] what seemed impossible. It's those of
[2:06:50] our in our family who came through the
[2:06:52] Great Depression.
[2:06:54] It's those who have lived through
[2:06:55] inflation. It's those who've lived
[2:06:56] through recession. It's those who didn't
[2:06:59] have a choice. What would be for dinner
[2:07:01] tonight? Steak or chicken? Neither. It
[2:07:04] was going to be beans.
[2:07:09] cornbread when you're lucky. You know,
[2:07:12] folks have died, give their lives, lived
[2:07:15] out their lives without having enough so
[2:07:18] that you and I could come to where we
[2:07:19] are today and be picky and choosy.
[2:07:23] You don't like spaghetti? Tough.
[2:07:26] That's what we have.
[2:07:29] That's what my granddaddy told me. Of
[2:07:31] course, he was a officer in the
[2:07:33] military, but that's what he told me. He
[2:07:36] said, "That's what we're having and
[2:07:37] that's what you're eating." Now, if you
[2:07:40] want to go to the
[2:07:42] hotel, I'm
[2:07:46] five. If you want to go to the hotel,
[2:07:49] you can have what they're having. Maybe
[2:07:51] Waldorf salad. He would
[2:07:54] say,
[2:07:55] Goose. But here, we're having spaghetti.
[2:07:58] You know what I did? I ate spaghetti.
[2:08:02] Did you like it? I did not.
[2:08:06] But I ate it. Even in my time where we
[2:08:10] had plenty more than my parents and
[2:08:12] their parents, even in my time, I
[2:08:15] understood. I had to learn to
[2:08:17] understand. We're where we are today by
[2:08:20] the grace of God. What we have, he give
[2:08:23] us. We have to be thankful for what he
[2:08:25] had. My grandparents lived in an
[2:08:29] apartment my entire life that they
[2:08:32] rented from someone else. and paid
[2:08:35] money. My mother's mom and dad never
[2:08:38] even owned a piece of property for
[2:08:43] themselves. I didn't even know the
[2:08:45] difference as a child. It wasn't until I
[2:08:48] was an adult that I cried for them. They
[2:08:51] didn't care. They made it. But I cried
[2:08:55] when I realized he retired from the army
[2:08:58] as an
[2:08:59] officer. And they didn't even own a
[2:09:02] piece of property to call their own.
[2:09:04] Heritage is big, folks. There's things
[2:09:07] we may not be proud of behind us, but we
[2:09:11] can make a difference for what what is
[2:09:13] ahead of us, but we'll never do it by
[2:09:16] disregarding and not honoring what
[2:09:18] brought us to where we are. Can you say
[2:09:21] amen? My problem when I first began to
[2:09:24] come around the message, my problem was
[2:09:25] the way the way that so many people
[2:09:28] spoke about Pentecost like it was some
[2:09:30] kind of disease.
[2:09:32] And I would get so discouraged hearing
[2:09:34] such horrible things said about
[2:09:36] Pentecost. And then I would listen to
[2:09:38] the tapes and I'd hear Brother Brandham
[2:09:39] say, "I'm a Pentecostal from the top of
[2:09:41] my head to the soles of my feet." Not
[2:09:44] denominational Pentecostal, but a
[2:09:47] Pentecostal by experience.
[2:09:52] It was my heritage. It was where I come
[2:09:54] from. I didn't appreciate people calling
[2:09:56] it slop. Amen. It brought me to where I
[2:10:00] was. When he, the Spirit, has come, he
[2:10:02] will lead you and guide you and direct
[2:10:04] you where? Into all truth. That's right.
[2:10:08] Today, I just wish folks would receive
[2:10:11] the Holy Ghost. I wish they would just
[2:10:14] have an experience of their own. I'm I'm
[2:10:17] I'm hurrying.
[2:10:20] Heritage in a spiritual sense is is a
[2:10:22] sacred thread also that weaves through
[2:10:25] generations.
[2:10:28] It's
[2:10:29] invisible. It's wisdom. Its values, its
[2:10:33] essence, its doctrine, its truth, its
[2:10:36] respect for a prophet. It's
[2:10:38] understanding why we are, who we
[2:10:41] are. It flows from ancestor to
[2:10:45] ancestor. For some of you, you're the
[2:10:48] first in your family line that you know
[2:10:50] of to have a real bornagain experience
[2:10:52] with God. Therefore, you have a greater
[2:10:55] obligation to pass that to your children
[2:10:57] and your grandchildren as do I.
[2:11:02] It's more than tradition then. It's more
[2:11:04] than just a bloodline. It's the lineage
[2:11:06] of spirituality. It's a spiritual DNA.
[2:11:10] It's the unspoken knowing that's passed
[2:11:12] down through stories told by by the by
[2:11:16] the fire light at
[2:11:18] night or around the Thanksgiving table.
[2:11:23] Today these holidays have become so
[2:11:27] carnal, so worldly, so
[2:11:30] commercial. But it used to be another
[2:11:32] opportunity to pass down some
[2:11:35] heritage, some spiritual truth, some
[2:11:39] old-fashioned testimonies about how
[2:11:41] somebody met God.
[2:11:44] It's worth it's worth hearing.
[2:11:47] Somebody said, but they say it over and
[2:11:49] over again. I don't
[2:11:53] care. I said to Benjamin one time, he he
[2:11:57] so
[2:11:59] enjoyed Jenna's grandfather, Brother
[2:12:01] Syler, Elder Brother Syler, giving his
[2:12:04] testimonies about his experiences,
[2:12:06] coming to to know the ministry of
[2:12:08] Brother
[2:12:09] Brandham. And he likes to tell them
[2:12:11] every time he's around. And of course,
[2:12:12] this precious family, they particularly
[2:12:15] have heard them. Wonder how many times
[2:12:18] Jenna's dad's heard them. I hope this is
[2:12:20] all right to say. I'm saying it in a
[2:12:21] very respectful way. No telling how many
[2:12:24] times he's heard them. There's going to
[2:12:27] come a time it didn't may maybe it's not
[2:12:29] here now, but there's going to come a
[2:12:30] time that it's going to be important
[2:12:31] because they're going to have to fill in
[2:12:33] those little details that he might miss
[2:12:34] one day. He might forget to tell one
[2:12:36] part and somebody's about to say, "Go
[2:12:37] ahead, grandpa. Don't forget to tell."
[2:12:41] I I just said to Benjamin in the
[2:12:43] beginning, he caught a little bit.
[2:12:44] Excuse me. He caught a little bit of it
[2:12:46] on video the first Thanksgiving that he
[2:12:48] was there, a part of the family, and
[2:12:50] played it for me. And I said, "Whatever
[2:12:52] you do," he was so proud to hear it. I
[2:12:55] said, "Whatever you do, smile every time
[2:12:57] he tells it.
[2:12:59] Ask a question. Agree. Shake your head.
[2:13:01] Amen. Do something to let him know that
[2:13:04] his testimony is not in vain. That his
[2:13:07] desire to pass his godly heritage down
[2:13:10] to his children is not in vain. It's
[2:13:12] valuable. It's worth dying for.
[2:13:16] It's so precious.
[2:13:19] If your children are going to have to
[2:13:21] guess what you believe, there's
[2:13:23] something wrong with your experience.
[2:13:29] If I die and my children have to figure
[2:13:31] out what I stood for, I didn't stand
[2:13:35] very loud, did I?
[2:13:39] Proverbs 22:28. I've got a little more
[2:13:42] time. I'm taking
[2:13:45] it. Proverbs 22:28, remove
[2:13:49] not the ancient
[2:13:52] landmark which thy fathers have
[2:13:55] set. The complete Jewish Bible says,
[2:13:58] don't move the ancient boundary stone
[2:14:02] set up by your ancestors. Do you
[2:14:05] understand that concept?
[2:14:08] In the earliest times of Israel, the
[2:14:10] property of families was divided and it
[2:14:12] was marked by boundary
[2:14:14] stones. Neighbors agreed in advance
[2:14:17] where the stones would lie. And it was a
[2:14:19] violation of the law, not only the civil
[2:14:22] law, but the moral law,
[2:14:26] God's law. It was a violation of the law
[2:14:29] to move those boundary stones. It be
[2:14:32] like you pulling up a stop that the
[2:14:35] surveyor had driven down on your land
[2:14:37] and saying, "No, that's not where the
[2:14:38] line is. I'm just moving it where I
[2:14:40] think it ought to be." You might get in
[2:14:42] a little bit of trouble doing that.
[2:14:44] Well, you would have gotten a lot of
[2:14:46] trouble in Bible days.
[2:14:48] In the ancient world, in agricultural
[2:14:50] societies, especially like Israel, these
[2:14:53] landmarks, these boundary stones were
[2:14:55] sacred. Did you know they still find
[2:14:56] them in the land of Israel today?
[2:14:59] boundary stones, walls, little short
[2:15:02] walls of stone to go all around the
[2:15:05] borders of the property. When I moved on
[2:15:08] my little piece of land there, just a
[2:15:09] not much more than a lot. When I moved
[2:15:12] there, from one end of that property to
[2:15:14] the next was a little tiny uhh stack of
[2:15:18] stones. And I don't mean in ever so
[2:15:20] often. I mean, the whole border was that
[2:15:23] that old retired man that built that
[2:15:25] place, him and his wife, they laid
[2:15:27] little piles of stones all like they
[2:15:30] were marking a flower bed, but they were
[2:15:32] marking the borders of their
[2:15:34] property. In Bible times, it was even
[2:15:36] more serious to move a landmark. In
[2:15:39] Deuteronomy 19:14, "Thou shalt not
[2:15:41] remove thy neighbors landmark, which
[2:15:43] they of old time have set in thine
[2:15:46] inheritance, which thou shalt inherit in
[2:15:48] the land that the Lord thy God giveth
[2:15:50] thee to possess it. Don't touch it."
[2:15:53] Deuteronomy 27:17,
[2:15:57] "Cursed, cursed be he that removeth his
[2:16:01] neighbor's landmark, and all the people
[2:16:04] shall say,
[2:16:07] cursed." If you look in the context of
[2:16:09] Deuteronomy 27, it's mentioned with a
[2:16:12] whole list of things that a curse will
[2:16:15] fall on you if you participate in. Can I
[2:16:18] give you just an idea? Idolatry is
[2:16:20] mentioned first and then incest and
[2:16:23] bestiality.
[2:16:26] Can you believe that God is equating
[2:16:30] moving a
[2:16:31] boundary that you're not authoriz Oh
[2:16:35] that you're not authorized to move
[2:16:39] you're not the authority to move that to
[2:16:42] change that to adjust that? Can you
[2:16:45] believe that God is equating that in
[2:16:49] scripture
[2:16:52] to Yes, sir.
[2:16:55] people and
[2:16:58] animals, murder, verse
[2:17:02] 24, bribery, verse
[2:17:06] 25. That tells me that these landmarks
[2:17:10] were important. and to move
[2:17:13] them was as detestable to God as if you
[2:17:17] bowed down in verse 15 and worshiped a
[2:17:20] graven or molted im molten image an
[2:17:23] abomination under the Lord the work of
[2:17:24] the hands of the craftsman and putth it
[2:17:26] in a secret place and all the people
[2:17:27] shall answer and say remember this was
[2:17:30] the dividing of the blessing and the
[2:17:31] cursing on the two mountains and they
[2:17:34] were reading off these blessings and
[2:17:36] then they were reading off these curses
[2:17:38] and every time the blessings came they
[2:17:39] answered amen all the people said amen
[2:17:41] Amen. And every time the curses came and
[2:17:43] all the people said, "Amen." God said,
[2:17:44] "I don't want you to touch the borders
[2:17:48] of the land of your
[2:17:50] ancestors, don't move those marks, those
[2:17:54] landmarks." Are you with me? Job 24:2. I
[2:17:58] got to go. Got to close eventually in
[2:18:01] amplified. Some remove the
[2:18:03] landmarks. They violently take away
[2:18:06] flocks and pasture them, appropriating
[2:18:08] land and flocks openly.
[2:18:12] Sheep
[2:18:13] thieves stealing somebody else's
[2:18:15] livestock by moving landmarks, violently
[2:18:18] moving them, snatching them. I don't
[2:18:20] care what you
[2:18:22] say. You have no authority over my
[2:18:25] family. I'll move this landmark when I
[2:18:28] get ready to move this landmark. And I
[2:18:30] double dog dare you to say anything
[2:18:32] about it. You better not preach about
[2:18:35] sin.
[2:18:40] It's where we're headed in this
[2:18:43] world. There's so many
[2:18:51] scriptures. Here's the
[2:18:55] reality. Ancient property thieves rarely
[2:18:59] moved an entire boundary stone in one
[2:19:04] night.
[2:19:11] That was too
[2:19:12] obvious, too
[2:19:15] risky. They seemed
[2:19:19] to
[2:19:20] practice something more subtle than
[2:19:23] that. They would sneak out in the
[2:19:26] darkness of night and move the boundary
[2:19:28] stone an inch or two at a time.
[2:19:37] just an inch or two at a
[2:19:38] time and unnoticed,
[2:19:41] undetected property owner just, you
[2:19:44] know, walking around. He's not paying
[2:19:45] that much
[2:19:47] attention. How many of you know a little
[2:19:49] at a time adds up?
[2:19:52] You follow me?
[2:19:55] No one with any sense would move a
[2:19:57] landmark all at once. Too obvious, too
[2:19:59] suspicious, too risky. Instead, a
[2:20:01] dishonest neighbor might nudge it
[2:20:04] slightly, just a few inches every season
[2:20:07] or just a few inches every night or just
[2:20:09] a few inches every week, just moving it
[2:20:12] a little bit at a time. Over time, the
[2:20:14] encroachment would be barely noticeable.
[2:20:18] But after years, hear me now and hear me
[2:20:21] well. After years of gradual shifting,
[2:20:27] now the property line had moved so
[2:20:33] far that the original border seemed
[2:20:37] unreasonable. It seemed
[2:20:39] outdated. It seemed too extreme. It
[2:20:43] sound like legalism. It felt like just
[2:20:47] religion.
[2:20:51] By the time the rightful owner realized
[2:20:53] what had happened, the new boundaries
[2:20:54] had become accepted and even defended by
[2:20:58] the surrounding
[2:21:00] culture. The devil doesn't begin by
[2:21:02] demanding that the church deny
[2:21:06] holiness, forsake truth, or abandon the
[2:21:09] old paths
[2:21:11] outright. Instead, he whispers, "Are you
[2:21:13] with me?
[2:21:14] Are you hearing me? He whispers. Oh,
[2:21:17] it's just a small
[2:21:20] adjustment. I'm not really one of them
[2:21:24] anyway. I'm just worshiping among
[2:21:28] them. Don't they know that the culture
[2:21:31] has changed
[2:21:32] and that is just too too legal, too
[2:21:36] judgmental?
[2:21:39] Let me tell you something. You should
[2:21:40] never feel judgmental toward anybody
[2:21:43] because you've got an understanding of
[2:21:45] truth.
[2:21:47] You should always pray for those who
[2:21:49] don't know. I have a lot more patience
[2:21:51] for those who don't know than I do for
[2:21:53] those who do know and pretend not to
[2:21:55] know because it's no longer the life
[2:21:57] they want to live. Preach now.
[2:22:00] Yes, sir. They just decided one day I
[2:22:02] ain't that.
[2:22:04] I just ain't that no more. Come on.
[2:22:06] Well, I I can't have the same compassion
[2:22:08] for them as I do for people that don't
[2:22:10] know any better. There's plenty of
[2:22:12] people sitting in church this morning
[2:22:14] that don't know. They don't seem to
[2:22:16] really grasp and understand that God
[2:22:18] cares that a woman look like a woman and
[2:22:21] live like a woman and dress like a woman
[2:22:23] and conduct herself like a woman and
[2:22:26] that a man be a man and live like a man
[2:22:28] and play man's sports
[2:22:33] if he
[2:22:34] plays.
[2:22:36] and goes to the man's locker room.
[2:22:42] I enjoyed hearing some of the message
[2:22:44] debate on the social media about
[2:22:47] beards or how worldly they are.
[2:22:52] Anything can become trendy.
[2:22:55] Because something all of a sudden
[2:22:57] becomes trendy doesn't make it worldly.
[2:23:03] Because the same trend that brought it
[2:23:05] in will take it out.
[2:23:10] [Music]
[2:23:12] Biblically, we do understand, don't we,
[2:23:16] that our Lord
[2:23:18] and his disciples and the prophets
[2:23:21] before him?
[2:23:25] So, so why don't they just throw stones
[2:23:28] at one another? And they do. They go on
[2:23:30] for
[2:23:33] pages. I read it until I want to puke
[2:23:35] and then I go on to something more
[2:23:38] cheery because folks are dying,
[2:23:41] backsliding, going to hell, joining
[2:23:44] other churches,
[2:23:46] leaving the message.
[2:23:50] While we can't decide whether a man
[2:23:52] ought to have a beard or not,
[2:23:55] find something that matters and get on
[2:23:58] it and stick with it and show it to me
[2:24:01] in the word.
[2:24:04] Don't pull some isolated quote from
[2:24:07] somewhere out of nowhere
[2:24:10] and make that scripture. That's right.
[2:24:17] Oh, I I see how the landmark gets moved.
[2:24:21] I hope you do, too. Just a little at a
[2:24:24] time.
[2:24:27] Just a little at a time. I'm old enough
[2:24:29] to have been around the Pentecostal
[2:24:31] world long enough to remember when when
[2:24:33] I was a boy, they preached it. Please
[2:24:35] don't be offended if this is not your
[2:24:36] your uh way. If you're watching this, if
[2:24:39] you're sitting here, don't be offended.
[2:24:40] This is not directed toward you. It's
[2:24:42] it's it's the truth that I stand and and
[2:24:45] live for and am willing to die for. It's
[2:24:47] just the reality of my life. I remember
[2:24:50] when the old preacher said, "The best
[2:24:52] way to please God and keep your keep
[2:24:54] your uh uh keep the scripture of 1
[2:24:56] Corinthians chapter 11, making sure that
[2:24:59] a woman understands her her long hair is
[2:25:01] given her for a covering. It doesn't say
[2:25:03] her hair is given her. Her long hair is
[2:25:05] given her for a covering. And the Bible
[2:25:08] tells us that if she chooses to be
[2:25:09] uncovered, she might as well be shorn.
[2:25:12] shaved
[2:25:14] because in this case, a little bit
[2:25:15] doesn't
[2:25:17] count. It's keeping it
[2:25:19] long or it's shaven in the eyes of God.
[2:25:24] That's exactly what the scripture is
[2:25:25] saying. You're one or the other. You
[2:25:27] either have long hair for a covering or
[2:25:29] you're bald in God's sight. The scriptur
[2:25:31] is pretty clear. But I'm old enough to
[2:25:34] to know and watch and remember when they
[2:25:37] used to preach that. And the old
[2:25:38] preachers used to say, "Now that's what
[2:25:39] the word says.
[2:25:41] And then they would give us their
[2:25:43] thoughts on how to keep
[2:25:44] that. And we never took what they said
[2:25:48] as equal to the
[2:25:49] scripture. But we appreciated what they
[2:25:52] what they brought. And they used to say
[2:25:54] the best way to do that is keep the
[2:25:56] scissors out of it.
[2:26:06] I know you'd rather have a cupcake.
[2:26:11] And we, you know, I don't know what we
[2:26:13] thought, but I guess there were probably
[2:26:14] some people that thought that was
[2:26:15] extreme.
[2:26:18] So, they started
[2:26:19] adjusting. They started changing their
[2:26:21] mind as time went by. And they started
[2:26:24] saying, "Well, I guess, you know, if a
[2:26:26] if a little girl needed some little
[2:26:28] bangs or mama's having a hard time
[2:26:30] putting her hair together, and I'm sure
[2:26:31] it's terrible
[2:26:32] hard. I understand it would
[2:26:36] be. I guess if a mother's struggling
[2:26:39] like that and wanted to give her little
[2:26:40] girl
[2:26:43] bangs, even sister Brandham did
[2:26:46] it for her
[2:26:48] daughters. If I remember what the
[2:26:51] prophet said correctly, he said, "I wish
[2:26:52] you wouldn't do that publicly in front
[2:26:54] of the whole church. I wish you wouldn't
[2:26:57] do that." But you
[2:27:00] did. Just made some made a little
[2:27:02] easier, I guess, on Sunday morning. You
[2:27:03] just put wings or whatever you you know
[2:27:06] that's what they called them, wasn't it?
[2:27:08] Bangs. And then and then they winged
[2:27:11] feathered them. Feathered them back.
[2:27:13] Hey, I'm I'm doing
[2:27:17] this. And then you know the preachers
[2:27:20] would say you asked the preacher out of
[2:27:22] the pool pit. If you were to ask him
[2:27:23] something in the pull pit, he'd have
[2:27:24] told you what the word said. But you got
[2:27:27] him off behind the church somewhere and
[2:27:28] they said to him, "Well, what about dead
[2:27:30] ends?
[2:27:35] and he'd say, "Well, I I guess, you
[2:27:37] know, uh I guess it probably wouldn't
[2:27:39] matter, you know, it probably be
[2:27:42] healthier. You know, probably help your
[2:27:44] hair grow in or something. I don't know.
[2:27:45] I don't know much about those things.
[2:27:46] I'm not talking about Brother. I'm
[2:27:47] talking about our
[2:27:49] pastors in in my childhood. Don't don't
[2:27:53] misunderstand." And they say, "Yeah, I
[2:27:55] guess it'd be all right if you just take
[2:27:56] it off." Well, well, how much? Well,
[2:27:58] well, well, how how how how long are the
[2:28:01] ends? How long are they how long are
[2:28:03] they frizzled and frazzled and and
[2:28:05] whatever you call it? Well, uh, since
[2:28:08] it's been so long, mine are about that
[2:28:10] long. Oh, you'd say, "Oo, that's a lot.
[2:28:13] That's long. That's a lot." You know
[2:28:15] what? And the women would walk away.
[2:28:17] They wouldn't know what he was saying.
[2:28:19] They They wouldn't know what to
[2:28:20] do because he was so vague. It would
[2:28:24] have been better if he would have
[2:28:25] preached it like his daddy did. Keep the
[2:28:28] scissors out. Then you don't have to
[2:28:29] worry about how long is long.
[2:28:32] I was called as an 18-year-old boy
[2:28:35] before the council of the Assemblies of
[2:28:37] God in Phoenix City, Alabama at First
[2:28:39] Assembly of God by by I almost called
[2:28:41] his name. That's not important. By the
[2:28:43] by the superintendent. He and he looked
[2:28:45] me across the table because I was
[2:28:47] pastoring at 18 was 17. I was pastoring
[2:28:49] at 17 one of their churches over here on
[2:28:51] 12th Street and 12th Court. And he asked
[2:28:53] me, he said, "Well, how long is long?
[2:28:56] How short is
[2:28:59] short? You know what I said? I said it
[2:29:02] long is as long as your mama's hair was
[2:29:05] the day we buried her out there on the
[2:29:07] hill.
[2:29:09] That's how long long is. That's how long
[2:29:11] long
[2:29:12] is. You see, the generation before him
[2:29:16] died in their faith.
[2:29:19] The next generation wanted to pressure
[2:29:21] the young preachers to make sure that we
[2:29:23] didn't preach it like their daddies did.
[2:29:27] I was in denomination. I was in
[2:29:28] denomination. You understand how it
[2:29:30] works. And so, uh, well, a half an inch.
[2:29:33] And then you you follow Jacksonites
[2:29:35] around this message, you know, because
[2:29:37] brother Jackson had this idea. If you
[2:29:39] cut it an inch at a time, it doesn't
[2:29:41] matter.
[2:29:42] Somebody needed to teach him some
[2:29:44] things. Somebody needed to explain to
[2:29:47] him that an inch upon an inch upon an
[2:29:50] inch upon an
[2:29:51] inch. See that you move not the ancient
[2:29:54] landmarks. I wish somebody would help me
[2:29:56] preach today. See that you don't move
[2:29:59] those ancient landmarks. It doesn't
[2:30:01] matter whether you move them by six feet
[2:30:03] at a time or an inch at a time. Moving
[2:30:06] them an inch at a time is going to make
[2:30:08] a difference. If it doesn't make a
[2:30:10] difference in this generation, it'll
[2:30:12] make a difference in the next.
[2:30:16] It's just
[2:30:18] simple. It will make a difference.
[2:30:23] And if you don't believe it has, you
[2:30:25] just go down here to a scene.
[2:30:28] When Jason Crab is back, well, you're
[2:30:31] just throwing at other church. You know,
[2:30:32] I'm just calling it exactly like it is.
[2:30:34] You go down there and you look around
[2:30:36] cuz Sister Drake is dead.
[2:30:39] We buried her a few years ago. She was
[2:30:41] the last one in a church of
[2:30:44] 350 who had long hair. She remembered
[2:30:47] what was preached to her. She remembered
[2:30:49] what the word said. She remembered that
[2:30:51] she wasn't even to approach God with her
[2:30:53] head uncovered according to the New
[2:30:55] Testament. 1 Corinthians chapter 11 is
[2:30:57] not in the old covenant of the law.
[2:31:01] She remembered it and they laughed at
[2:31:03] her. Some of them, some of them made fun
[2:31:04] of her. Some of them said, "Why in the
[2:31:06] world you
[2:31:10] Few months ago, my dear friend, Sister
[2:31:14] Bale, Assembly of God pastor, who
[2:31:16] pastored many, many churches. I
[2:31:18] understand what the scripture teaches
[2:31:19] about women
[2:31:21] pastors. And I agree 100% with what the
[2:31:24] Bible said. She was a dear woman. She
[2:31:27] was doing God a service without it being
[2:31:28] his will. And she's in God's hands.
[2:31:32] But I asked her one time because she
[2:31:33] remained in the Assemblies of God for
[2:31:35] many years. She did eventually move out,
[2:31:37] but for many years she did. She and my
[2:31:40] granny both, so to speak, until my
[2:31:42] granny heard the message, which was the
[2:31:44] last few months of her life. And we went
[2:31:46] to those council meetings. I would go
[2:31:48] with them, the big big uh state meetings
[2:31:50] and big it even went San San Antonio,
[2:31:53] Texas to the national meeting and they'd
[2:31:56] be the only ones in the
[2:31:58] room. If Sister Mayo, as long as Sister
[2:32:00] Mayo lived, she would be the
[2:32:03] third. Their church betrayed
[2:32:08] them. You can say amen or me. Their
[2:32:11] church betrayed them. They preached it
[2:32:13] to them like there was no way out. And
[2:32:16] then they decided somewhere along the
[2:32:18] way it's no longer Bible. But problem is
[2:32:21] it's Bible. It's there. It's staring us
[2:32:23] in the face. If I was up here just
[2:32:24] preaching church tradition, you don't
[2:32:26] even have to listen. But I'm giving you
[2:32:29] chapter and verse. And I watched it. I
[2:32:32] watched it. I watched it. I watched it
[2:32:34] at my wife's funeral. Let me let me
[2:32:35] really make some folks mad watching
[2:32:37] this. I watched it at my wife's funeral
[2:32:40] when all those old sisters that grew up
[2:32:42] in the church where they were told in
[2:32:44] the message in the message. That's
[2:32:46] right. An inch at a time. I saw those
[2:32:49] precious dear old sisters, most of them
[2:32:50] dead now, who came to pay respects to my
[2:32:54] wife's mother who heard the message in
[2:32:56] that movement but moved on quickly back
[2:32:58] to the
[2:33:00] word. And I saw them little women with
[2:33:03] their hair like up like this, all
[2:33:06] blue. Blue. Cuz that's what happens when
[2:33:09] your hair's supposed to be
[2:33:11] gray. And you decide you're going to put
[2:33:14] some kind of tint to it. White. When
[2:33:16] it's supposed to be white, they put this
[2:33:18] kind of tint. So, every one of them look
[2:33:20] like little blue-haired ladies. That's
[2:33:22] all how I know how to say. They all look
[2:33:24] like little blue-haired ladies across
[2:33:26] there. Not one of them had hair that
[2:33:27] barely touched their shoulders. And it
[2:33:29] blows my mind that they believed the
[2:33:31] same message and based it on the same
[2:33:33] word that I based it on. You see, I
[2:33:36] could have stood up that day. I didn't,
[2:33:37] but I could have stood up that day and
[2:33:39] said, "An inch at a time, moving those
[2:33:42] old landmarks,
[2:33:45] an inch at a time, may not seem like a
[2:33:49] lot at the moment,
[2:33:57] but it doesn't take long.
[2:34:03] It just simply doesn't take
[2:34:05] long. Here's what a prophet said, not
[2:34:08] concerning
[2:34:11] hair. In Alabama, he said it his only
[2:34:13] time. His only time in Alabama, a
[2:34:16] meeting that my grandmother was
[2:34:21] in. Verse paragraph 51, he said, "They
[2:34:24] they they forgot all about it. They had
[2:34:27] forgot his holiness. They had forgot his
[2:34:28] law. The women were living like the rest
[2:34:30] of the women. He's talking about the
[2:34:31] Israel's Israelites. God's church and
[2:34:34] his people has always been a separated
[2:34:36] people, a calledout people, a peculiar
[2:34:38] people, a holy nation, a royal
[2:34:39] priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices
[2:34:42] to God, the fruits of their lips, giving
[2:34:44] praise to his name. God called his
[2:34:46] church and separated it from the world
[2:34:48] for that very purpose. And he gave it a
[2:34:50] law. And he it must be holy. He said, "I
[2:34:54] am holy. You must be holy. and without
[2:35:00] holiness no man shall see the Lord. If a
[2:35:03] woman is supposed to have long hair, the
[2:35:05] same chapter a few verses before and
[2:35:07] after will explain to you that a man is
[2:35:09] not to have amen long
[2:35:15] hair. Paul was pretty specific in that
[2:35:18] explanation because he simply said, "You
[2:35:20] ought to know better from nature."
[2:35:24] Nature itself teaches you that it's a
[2:35:26] shame. I'm just reading, just quoting.
[2:35:30] It's a shame for a man to have long
[2:35:32] hair. So, don't leave here and say,
[2:35:34] "Well, you really got the women, but you
[2:35:35] didn't say anything about the men." You
[2:35:37] men know better, too. Yes, sir. You know
[2:35:41] better. It's not uh what Brother
[2:35:43] Brandham said. It's not what Brother
[2:35:44] Shelley said. It's what the Bible said.
[2:35:46] That's right. A man if he if he has long
[2:35:49] hair and he prays like that, the Bible
[2:35:51] said he's praying with his head covered
[2:35:53] and that is
[2:35:57] forbidden.
[2:35:58] Yikes. See your
[2:36:03] barber. You you you've got to be fair.
[2:36:06] You're preaching the word,
[2:36:08] you know. Jonathan has nothing to worry
[2:36:10] about.
[2:36:13] Ben has nothing to worry about.
[2:36:15] I'm just telling you what the scripture
[2:36:17] is saying. Somebody said, "I'm not ready
[2:36:18] for all this," folks. You know, it don't
[2:36:21] it don't work that way. Somebody said,
[2:36:23] "That's why I don't want nothing to do
[2:36:24] with church." I don't it doesn't matter
[2:36:26] to me whether you want to do anything
[2:36:27] with church or not. I'm not talking
[2:36:29] about church annity. I'm talking about
[2:36:31] do you want to serve the God of the
[2:36:33] Bible? If you want to serve the God of
[2:36:35] the Bible, you got to go the Bible way.
[2:36:37] You got to stand on the word like
[2:36:39] Neabboth did. You got to say, "Devil,
[2:36:41] you're not getting my vineyard. I don't
[2:36:42] care who you are, how much money you
[2:36:44] have.
[2:36:47] That's right.
[2:36:49] It goes on in verse uh excuse me,
[2:36:52] paragraph 75, and I'm musicians are
[2:36:54] easing this way. He said, you know, the
[2:36:56] old saying, fools will walk with hop
[2:36:59] nailed shoes where angels fear to trot.
[2:37:02] He said, that's what this spiritual
[2:37:04] amnesia does.
[2:37:11] It makes people get to a spot till where
[2:37:13] they have no feeling on the inside of
[2:37:15] them. They don't want nothing
[2:37:17] spiritual. They've become so numb.
[2:37:20] They've become so defensive of their
[2:37:23] life that they feel
[2:37:28] nothing. It's not out in the world where
[2:37:30] people get spiritual amnesia. It's
[2:37:33] sitting on the pews of the church.
[2:37:35] I have no stones to throw, but I I
[2:37:37] wouldn't mind to say this morning to
[2:37:39] this precious group of people that I
[2:37:40] love with all my
[2:37:43] heart. There may be those sitting among
[2:37:45] us today,
[2:37:47] us with spiritual
[2:37:49] amnesia, forgetting, forgetting. It's
[2:37:53] easy to
[2:37:54] forget. You pull away, you
[2:37:57] forget. I don't want you to become
[2:38:00] Facebook warriors. I want you to be
[2:38:02] warriors on your job. I want you to be
[2:38:04] warriors in life. I want you to show
[2:38:06] your neighbors what it means to live a
[2:38:08] Christian life. I don't want you to
[2:38:09] please don't go condemning anybody.
[2:38:11] Don't get on social media and and and
[2:38:14] preach things that people have no grid.
[2:38:16] They they have no grid. You're talking
[2:38:19] to people about
[2:38:27] they they can't they it's not that
[2:38:29] you're you want to compromise it, but is
[2:38:31] that really the most important
[2:38:35] thing? I I I I've got a friend there in
[2:38:38] Canada who who is a preacher. He post
[2:38:40] and and he most every post is a woman
[2:38:43] that doesn't listen to her husband is
[2:38:45] out of order. Yeah.
[2:38:48] We
[2:38:50] know. We know that. We've heard it
[2:38:53] preached. The Bible said so. We believe
[2:38:56] it. Why don't you ever post about a
[2:39:00] husband that is so spiritually
[2:39:03] wishy-washy
[2:39:05] that his wife doesn't know what to do?
[2:39:10] He beats her with a quote
[2:39:12] instead of leading her with a life.
[2:39:15] Furthermore, why don't you post about
[2:39:18] what it means to be born again,
[2:39:23] sanctified, filled with the Holy Ghost.
[2:39:27] You want to air these things in front of
[2:39:29] people who have no grid to even accept
[2:39:33] it. My Lord, give them Jesus. Speak
[2:39:37] Jesus over them. Speak Jesus to them.
[2:39:40] Testify of what he's done in your life.
[2:39:43] Praise God. Don't you let the devil beat
[2:39:46] you up because you're not what you want
[2:39:48] to be or you're not what you ought to
[2:39:50] be. You give God praise every breath you
[2:39:53] have for the the fact that you're not
[2:39:56] what you used to be.
[2:39:59] The blood the blood has done something
[2:40:02] in your life. We're
[2:40:06] closing. We really are.
[2:40:12] Paragraph
[2:40:15] 78. You must be identified somewhere.
[2:40:18] You must show your life shows tonight
[2:40:20] where you are
[2:40:23] identified. Oh, I love I I love the
[2:40:27] mysteries.
[2:40:28] I I love the seals.
[2:40:36] I love looking at all the things that
[2:40:38] are spoken about the thunders about the
[2:40:42] trumpets to the
[2:40:44] Jews. I love these
[2:40:48] things and I believe there's a time to
[2:40:51] not only study them, there's a time to
[2:40:53] preach
[2:40:57] them. Brother Bannam didn't tell us the
[2:40:59] greatest battle ever fought is going to
[2:41:01] be a battle over doctrine.
[2:41:04] He said, "The greatest battle ever
[2:41:05] fought is going to be a battle of the
[2:41:07] mind. Satan trying to disqualify you."
[2:41:11] Folks, don't worry. Don't fret if you
[2:41:13] don't understand the fullness of the
[2:41:14] seventh seal. I hope you won't be
[2:41:16] offended when I tell you neither did
[2:41:18] Brother
[2:41:19] Brandham. How could you make such a
[2:41:21] statement? I'm just quoting
[2:41:23] him. It went by me in an unknown tongue.
[2:41:27] I could not make it out. Is that a
[2:41:30] shame? No. It's transparency.
[2:41:33] So don't you fret over something that
[2:41:35] that that may or may not be the most
[2:41:37] important thing for this moment in your
[2:41:39] life. But if you're moving the landmark,
[2:41:43] if your children don't know what you
[2:41:44] believe this this week,
[2:41:48] because what you wouldn't let them do a
[2:41:50] week ago, you let them do now. That's
[2:41:53] what you need to be concerned about. Cuz
[2:41:55] one of these days, your hands are going
[2:41:57] to fold across your chest and the
[2:41:59] undertaker is going to close your
[2:42:01] eyelids and you're not going to have
[2:42:03] another opportunity to live a life
[2:42:05] before your family. This is your chance.
[2:42:08] Don't do it with judgment. Don't do it
[2:42:10] with condemnation. Don't do it with
[2:42:12] religion. Do it with love and do it with
[2:42:15] consistency. And don't touch the
[2:42:18] landmark
[2:42:22] that is not based on a conviction. It's
[2:42:25] based on the word. Yes, sir. If it's my
[2:42:28] conviction, you may get by without it.
[2:42:30] But if it's based on the word, you'll
[2:42:32] have to live the same life. I'll have to
[2:42:35] live the same life. It's not me
[2:42:37] preaching to you. It's me preaching to
[2:42:39] us.
[2:42:43] You're not Listen, I'm got to finish
[2:42:44] this quote. My my my somewhere you must
[2:42:47] show your life shows tonight where you
[2:42:49] are identified. You are identified
[2:42:50] either in Christ or out of Christ.
[2:42:54] What if we told you that? What if you
[2:42:55] What if that become a reality to you?
[2:42:57] You're either in him or you're out of
[2:42:59] him.
[2:43:01] What would you do? Well, if you
[2:43:03] recognize you were in him, you'd throw
[2:43:06] up your hands and heart and worship him.
[2:43:08] You'd live for him with everything you
[2:43:11] got. If you recognize you were out from
[2:43:14] him, you'd run to him.
[2:43:17] That's right. With everything that was
[2:43:19] within you, wouldn't you? He said, 'You
[2:43:23] identified either in Christ or out of
[2:43:25] Christ. You're not halfway. There's no
[2:43:27] such thing as a drunk sober man. You
[2:43:28] ever met a drunk sober
[2:43:30] man? You ever met a sober drunk
[2:43:33] man? Not at the same
[2:43:36] time. You've never met a man in Christ
[2:43:38] and out of Christ at the same time. He
[2:43:41] said you're a saint or a sinner, one or
[2:43:42] the other. Your spiritual attitude
[2:43:44] toward God's word identifies you exactly
[2:43:47] where you're standing. Right. If you're
[2:43:51] mad enough at me to spit a ten penny
[2:43:53] nail right at my
[2:43:57] forehead, you're probably not operating
[2:44:00] in the right spirit this
[2:44:03] morning. Your attitude toward what God's
[2:44:05] word says identifies exactly where
[2:44:08] you're standing. I pray it's just
[2:44:12] amnesia because many people
[2:44:15] recover from amnesia.
[2:44:18] Let the swelling of your brain go down.
[2:44:20] Let the inflammation go down. And you
[2:44:21] may come back to your senses and you may
[2:44:23] stand on the word like you never have
[2:44:25] before. That's right. The best advice I
[2:44:27] can give you as far as holiness goes is
[2:44:29] tend to your own house. Live it at home.
[2:44:31] Live it in front of your families and
[2:44:32] don't worry about nobody else's.
[2:44:35] It's not up to you whether they make it
[2:44:37] or not. It's up to God. Live clean. Live
[2:44:40] holy. Live according to the word. You're
[2:44:41] a saint or sinner, one or the other.
[2:44:43] Your spiritual attitude toward God's
[2:44:45] word identifies you exactly where you're
[2:44:47] standing. And if you were to go home and
[2:44:48] read the rest of that or hear the rest
[2:44:50] of that sermon, I encourage you to do
[2:44:51] so. Spiritual amnesia, in a few
[2:44:54] paragraphs, you'll come to my favorite,
[2:44:56] one of my favorite portions of preaching
[2:44:59] that Brother Brandham did in his entire
[2:45:01] ministry where he preaches on uh
[2:45:05] identification and where he talks about
[2:45:08] being a an American. I was there when
[2:45:11] they rang the Liberty bell or I was
[2:45:13] there when they I love that because he
[2:45:15] wasn't there in the
[2:45:17] natural. You weren't naturally in Christ
[2:45:21] at the crucifixion. You were there
[2:45:24] spiritually. You were identified with
[2:45:26] him in his suffering. You were
[2:45:27] identified with him in his death. You
[2:45:29] were identified with him in his
[2:45:30] resurrection. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:45:33] Hallelujah. And it means something.
[2:45:37] You You got any idea what this is about?
[2:45:41] Did you wonder? Be honest. Did any of
[2:45:43] you wonder at the beginning when
[2:45:44] Jonathan starts getting up and didn't I
[2:45:47] do
[2:45:49] good not watching
[2:45:52] him? We called him in, shut the door and
[2:45:54] said, "Don't look at anybody. Don't make
[2:45:56] eye contact with me. Don't make eye
[2:45:58] contact with anybody in the house. Just
[2:46:00] every little while get up and move it.
[2:46:02] Just a little at a while. A little at a
[2:46:03] time. Just a few inches at a time. Now,
[2:46:06] whether you realize it or not, here's
[2:46:07] the message. That that old that's an old
[2:46:11] antique hat rack of mine with an old
[2:46:14] jacket and an old Stson
[2:46:16] hat. And it represented today a landmark
[2:46:21] of
[2:46:22] heritage. And all through this two-hour
[2:46:25] sermon, he just got up and moved it a
[2:46:27] little bit at a time. Little bit time,
[2:46:28] little bit time. And and it walked from
[2:46:30] one end from one side all the way to the
[2:46:33] other side. If that was a landmark,
[2:46:37] Jonathan just
[2:46:38] stole quite a piece of real estate here.
[2:46:43] You could plant Brother Truman and
[2:46:45] Sister Martha, they could plant a mean
[2:46:48] pee patch between this wall and that
[2:46:51] wall. Come on. You woke up one morning
[2:46:54] and saw that your neighbor had moved the
[2:46:56] stab that far. I think you'd notice. But
[2:46:59] I don't know at what point along the way
[2:47:02] you would have recognized what was going
[2:47:04] on.
[2:47:06] And that's where the amnesia comes in.
[2:47:08] May we be shook by the Holy Spirit of
[2:47:12] God to understand that it is not big
[2:47:17] changes.
[2:47:19] Sometimes it's just a little subtle
[2:47:21] subtle. I could give you I could give
[2:47:23] you examples. It would be a lot closer
[2:47:24] to home. But I've chosen to try not to
[2:47:27] do that today.
[2:47:30] But I'll tell you what one thing Billy
[2:47:32] Graham
[2:47:34] said as you're
[2:47:38] standing. I know you're tired. I know
[2:47:41] that you are beyond your ability to
[2:47:44] comprehend because
[2:47:46] your bottom is worn
[2:47:48] out. You've been sitting that long.
[2:47:52] Billy Graham once said, "We now laugh at
[2:47:54] things that used to embarrass us 30
[2:47:57] years ago.
[2:48:04] It's a joke now. It didn't used to be a
[2:48:07] joke.
[2:48:10] It used to matter.
[2:48:12] I recently heard a podcast of some uh
[2:48:15] modern preachers, young men, nice, clean
[2:48:19] young
[2:48:25] men, very
[2:48:27] smart, very
[2:48:29] talented, very
[2:48:34] gifted. They were doing so well and then
[2:48:38] they started mocking the old church.
[2:48:44] And they
[2:48:46] said, you know, there used to be a
[2:48:49] problem with mixed bathing and that the
[2:48:52] church was so ignorant, you know, they
[2:48:54] they called it
[2:48:55] bathing. Well, isn't that what they call
[2:48:58] it now? Bathing
[2:49:01] suits. But they just made such
[2:49:05] fun. You know, the old church had so
[2:49:07] much about that that should be
[2:49:10] families or should be separated.
[2:49:12] And they just thought that was the
[2:49:14] funniest thing, the craziest thing
[2:49:16] they'd have ever
[2:49:17] heard. But the reality is those things
[2:49:20] were in place and preached for reasons.
[2:49:26] Not
[2:49:27] because necessarily adultery is going to
[2:49:30] take
[2:49:31] place, but because when those things get
[2:49:34] blended and we become more and more
[2:49:36] comfortable and the boundary gets moved
[2:49:39] an inch at a
[2:49:40] time, where will it end up?
[2:49:43] Those same churches today that preach
[2:49:46] those truths from scripture. Even
[2:49:48] modesty is a scriptural, it's a
[2:49:51] scriptural truth.
[2:49:54] Separation of the gender is a scriptural
[2:49:57] truth. Those churches today that used to
[2:50:00] preach that, now they come in, preachers
[2:50:02] and all with car, their cargo shorts on
[2:50:05] and their ball
[2:50:07] caps. Can you imagine their ball caps
[2:50:11] right into the service and they can't
[2:50:13] understand why the church cared about
[2:50:15] anything so
[2:50:17] silly? It just
[2:50:19] proves an inch at a time
[2:50:24] May God give us strength today to
[2:50:26] stand. Don't you love him? Is he worth
[2:50:30] everything? Worth giving everything? Is
[2:50:32] he worth selling out? He is. He is. I
[2:50:36] have a feeling that if we don't stand,
[2:50:38] manipulation is waiting in the wings to
[2:50:42] twist us right out of what God's given
[2:50:44] us. If you realize that you've made some
[2:50:47] subtle shifts and changes in your
[2:50:49] boundaries, may God give you courage and
[2:50:51] strength to put them where they belong
[2:50:53] as quickly as you possibly can and take
[2:50:55] time to explain them to your poor,
[2:50:57] confused
[2:51:01] children. For you to go home and be
[2:51:03] religious, extreme, and crazy, that
[2:51:05] wouldn't serve the point of this sermon.
[2:51:07] But to go home and use some wisdom,
[2:51:10] you're a teacher.
[2:51:13] You're teaching. You're teaching. You're
[2:51:14] teaching. You're teaching by word and by
[2:51:17] example. It's not too late. Aren't you
[2:51:20] glad? Aren't you glad? How many of you
[2:51:22] appreciate grace?
[2:51:25] Hallelujah. Well, if I don't believe
[2:51:27] that, I'll just go to another church. Go
[2:51:29] ahead.
[2:51:31] Go ahead. I pray the truth will chase
[2:51:32] you. I I pray the reality of God's word
[2:51:35] will never let you go.
[2:51:39] He knows how to find us.
[2:51:41] If you were born for this truth.
[2:51:46] Oh, Benjamin, can you come and worship
[2:51:48] in this in this this tight atmosphere
[2:51:51] I've created here? I don't even have a
[2:51:54] song to sing to help you get started. If
[2:51:57] you love him, let's come and worship him
[2:51:58] quickly. I realize it's 10 to two. It
[2:52:02] usually is before I'm done.
[2:52:06] You are not a God
[2:52:10] created by human hands. And you are not
[2:52:15] a God
[2:52:17] depending on any mortal
[2:52:21] man. You are not a God in need
[2:52:26] of anything we can give. and by your
[2:52:31] plan. That's just the way it is.
[2:52:36] [Music]
[2:52:39] And you are not a God
[2:52:43] created by human hands. And you are not
[2:52:48] a God
[2:52:51] dependent on any mortal man.
[2:52:55] You are not a God in need
[2:52:59] of anything we can give. And by your
[2:53:04] plans, that's just the way it
[2:53:09] is. You are God
[2:53:12] alone from before time
[2:53:16] began. Oh, you were on your
[2:53:20] throne and you are God alone.
[2:53:24] [Music]
[2:53:25] And right
[2:53:27] now in the good times and
[2:53:31] bad. You are on your
[2:53:35] throne. And you are God
[2:53:38] alone. And you are God
[2:53:42] alone from before time
[2:53:46] began. Oh, you were on your
[2:53:50] throne and you are God alone.
[2:53:55] And right now in the good times and bad.
[2:54:01] Oh, you are on your
[2:54:04] throne. And you are God
[2:54:11] alone. And you're the only God whose
[2:54:16] power none can contend.
[2:54:19] And you're the only God whose name and
[2:54:24] praise will never end. You're the only
[2:54:28] God who's
[2:54:30] worthy of everything we can give. You
[2:54:35] are God and that's just the way it
[2:54:40] is. You are God
[2:54:43] alone from before time began.
[2:54:48] Oh, you were on your
[2:54:51] throne and you are God
[2:54:55] alone. And right now, oh, in the good
[2:55:00] times and bad. Oh, you are on your
[2:55:05] throne and you are God alone.
[2:55:13] And you're the only God whose
[2:55:16] power none can
[2:55:19] contend. And you're the only God whose
[2:55:22] name and praise will never end. You're
[2:55:28] the only God who's
[2:55:31] worthy of everything we can give. You
[2:55:35] are God and that's just the way it is.
[2:55:41] You are God
[2:55:43] alone from before time
[2:55:47] began. Oh, you were on your
[2:55:51] throne. And you are God
[2:55:55] alone. And right now, oh, in the good
[2:56:00] times and bad, oh, you are on your
[2:56:05] throne. Yes, you are God
[2:56:09] alone. Cuz you're
[2:56:14] unchangeable and
[2:56:17] unshakeable. You're
[2:56:20] unstoppable. Oh, that's who you
[2:56:24] are. Oh, you're
[2:56:27] unchangeable and you're
[2:56:31] unshakeable and you're unstopp. Oh my
[2:56:35] god, that's who you are.
[2:56:39] Oh, you're
[2:56:42] unchangeable and
[2:56:45] unshakeable. You're
[2:56:49] unstoppable. That's who you
[2:56:52] are. Cuz you are God
[2:56:55] alone from before time
[2:56:59] began. Oh, you are on your
[2:57:03] throne. And you are God alone.
[2:57:08] And right now in the good times and
[2:57:14] bad you are on your
[2:57:18] throne. You are God
[2:57:21] alone and you are God
[2:57:25] alone from before time began.
[2:57:30] You are on your
[2:57:32] throne and you are God
[2:57:36] alone. And right now in the good times
[2:57:42] in
[2:57:43] bad you are on your
[2:57:47] throne and you are God alone.
[2:57:55] My
[2:57:57] Jesus, my
[2:58:00] savior. Lord, there is none like
[2:58:06] you. And all of my
[2:58:09] days, Lord, I want to praise the wonders
[2:58:16] of your
[2:58:17] [Laughter]
[2:58:19] mighty love.
[2:58:23] [Music]
[2:58:25] You're my
[2:58:28] comfort and my
[2:58:30] shelter, a tower of
[2:58:34] reuge and strength.
[2:58:37] Oh, let every
[2:58:40] breath let all that I am, let it never
[2:58:46] cease to
[2:58:49] worship
[2:58:51] you.
[2:58:53] Oh sh to the Lord all the earth. Let us
[2:59:00] sing of power and majesty.
[2:59:05] Praise to the King. Oh, mountains bow
[2:59:10] down and the seas will
[2:59:14] roar at the
[2:59:17] sound of your
[2:59:22] name. I sing for joy at the work of your
[2:59:28] hands. Lord, forever I'll love you.
[2:59:34] Forever I'll stand. Oh, nothing compares
[2:59:40] to the promise I have in
[2:59:46] you. Sing, shout to the Lord.
[2:59:51] Oh, shout to the Lord, all the earth.
[2:59:57] Let us sing. We sing power and
[3:00:02] majesty praise to the king. Oh,
[3:00:07] mountains bow down and the seas they
[3:00:12] roar. It's at the
[3:00:15] sound of your
[3:00:21] name. I sing for joy at the work of your
[3:00:27] hands. Lord, forever I'll love you.
[3:00:33] Forever I'll
[3:00:35] stand. Nothing compares to the promise I
[3:00:41] have.
[3:00:43] Oh, nothing compares to the proise I
[3:00:49] have. Nothing nothing you compares to
[3:00:54] the proise I have.
[3:00:58] in
[3:01:01] Lord, we pray right now in the name of
[3:01:04] Jesus that you will come and strengthen
[3:01:07] your bride that you will show her again
[3:01:11] your great love and your great power to
[3:01:14] strengthen to give courage to give
[3:01:17] boldness. Father, I pray that there will
[3:01:21] be a holy conviction that will rise
[3:01:24] within your people in this hour and that
[3:01:27] we will somehow by grace find our way
[3:01:31] back to the old landmarks. May we never
[3:01:34] be guilty of trying to change your word.
[3:01:37] If a landmark is based on your word,
[3:01:41] Lord, may we let it stand as is without
[3:01:45] feeling a need to adjust it for the
[3:01:48] generations. Lord, as fathers, would you
[3:01:50] help us as family members? Will you help
[3:01:54] us as church members? Will you help us
[3:01:58] to be strengthened, Lord, and to raise
[3:02:00] up the banner? Father, I thank you for
[3:02:03] grace. I thank you for amazing grace.
[3:02:08] And I know there are other pressing
[3:02:10] issues in the hearts and lives of your
[3:02:13] people today. Some need healing. You're
[3:02:15] the healer. I agree with them. I use my
[3:02:18] faith right now to be joined with theirs
[3:02:22] that you will touch them in this moment.
[3:02:24] I feel an urgency to pray for
[3:02:27] backsliders. Lord, you know where they
[3:02:30] are. You know that predestination and
[3:02:33] election leaves little room for being a
[3:02:36] backslider. It means sometime that we
[3:02:39] get off the course. But you know how
[3:02:43] like no other to pull us back into the
[3:02:46] middle of the road, back to the path
[3:02:48] that you would have for our feet. Would
[3:02:51] you agree with me right now? For even
[3:02:53] those you love that have stepped away,
[3:02:56] Lord, you know how to draw them. Draw
[3:03:00] them with your love. Draw them with your
[3:03:04] compassion. Lord, let us be salty so
[3:03:08] that they would again become
[3:03:12] thirsty. Lord, for other burdens, for
[3:03:16] anxieties, for
[3:03:18] depressions, for harassments of the
[3:03:20] enemy, for the lies that he breathes on
[3:03:24] all of us. May we find courage. May we
[3:03:27] find strength today to beat him back
[3:03:30] with the word. There's nothing that
[3:03:32] defeats the enemy like the using the
[3:03:35] word of God with a life behind it. As
[3:03:39] old brother Barker wrote the song, it's
[3:03:42] the life behind the name that makes the
[3:03:45] demons tremble. May we have the life
[3:03:49] behind the name when we speak of you,
[3:03:52] Lord. May there be a life behind it. If
[3:03:56] there be one person who doesn't
[3:03:58] understand these things and it's been
[3:04:00] presented so boldly today, would you
[3:04:03] would you open their eyes? Would you
[3:04:06] give them grace to choose you and your
[3:04:08] word above all other things? For every
[3:04:11] unspoken need that's represented around
[3:04:14] this altar today, we ask that you would
[3:04:16] move, that you would heal, that you
[3:04:19] would restore, and that you would
[3:04:21] refresh the weary bodies of those who
[3:04:23] work so hard. and we will give you the
[3:04:25] praise and the honor and the glory
[3:04:28] that's due your name in the precious
[3:04:31] name above every name, the name of the
[3:04:33] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. The saint said,
[3:04:37] "Amen." Would you just turn to someone
[3:04:39] near you just a moment quickly and just
[3:04:41] say, "God bless
[3:04:43] you." God bless you.
[3:04:48] prophet told us that's one of the most
[3:04:50] powerful things that we could say to
[3:04:52] someone. And just slip back to your seat
[3:04:54] because we have one more little thing
[3:04:56] that we want to do today before we go. I
[3:04:59] know it's late.
[3:05:11] [Music]
[3:05:13] We're not over yet, darling, but thank
[3:05:15] you so much for coming to love on me. I
[3:05:18] needed
[3:05:19] it. Just slip back to your seat and hold
[3:05:22] your peace just a minute, please. Yes.
[3:05:25] Go ahead. Now,
[3:05:27] look for me.
[3:05:50] Well, be seated just a moment. I know
[3:05:52] you're
[3:05:55] ready. Guess what?
[3:05:58] Uh we have a little baby that's getting
[3:06:01] bigger every
[3:06:03] day that we're going to get to dedicate
[3:06:05] to the Lord real quick today. And uh
[3:06:08] it's an honor. It's it's not a dread or
[3:06:11] a drudge or oh I or don't want to have
[3:06:13] to stay. You did when it was
[3:06:17] yours when it was your grandbaby or
[3:06:20] whatever. You'd have stayed all day if
[3:06:21] the preacher would have took that long.
[3:06:24] Amen. And so we want to uh have uh R.J.
[3:06:28] and and Miss Emily to come. As far as I
[3:06:32] know, she was the first baby that was
[3:06:34] born in this church as as we went
[3:06:37] through the shift of uh uh of coming
[3:06:40] out, bringing the little group out of
[3:06:42] denomination and uh into the truth of
[3:06:44] the hour. Uh and her parents married and
[3:06:48] and Emily was the the fruit of their
[3:06:51] love. And from the day she came till
[3:06:54] now, uh, I've looked at at had her a
[3:06:57] little special and I've called her Miss
[3:06:59] Emily, but she's my sister in the Lord,
[3:07:02] too. It's MS or M I SS, you know, and
[3:07:05] now she's now she's married. And look at
[3:07:08] these three beautiful, amazing children
[3:07:10] that God has given them. Aren't they
[3:07:13] blessed? Aren't we blessed because
[3:07:16] they're blessed? And uh, of course, uh,
[3:07:19] bring me a microphone, would you?
[3:07:21] because R.J. will be the one to dedicate
[3:07:23] his son to the Lord. But I get the
[3:07:26] blessing of praying over him. Why don't
[3:07:28] we have the family, any of the family
[3:07:30] that wants to come and stand with him,
[3:07:32] you all come center and then let them
[3:07:34] get around you. And uh we're just so
[3:07:38] blessed to have this opportunity to do
[3:07:40] it and we're thankful for the presence
[3:07:43] of the Lord. I'm going to miss you all.
[3:07:46] Uh not just in church, but I'm going to
[3:07:49] miss you all in the yard.
[3:07:52] When God gave us this
[3:07:54] land, it was my dream that families
[3:07:58] would live close and that children would
[3:08:02] play. It wasn't my dream that they would
[3:08:05] leave their toys everywhere.
[3:08:08] I almost uh I almost uh flattened a
[3:08:11] scooter on Monday morning coming to
[3:08:14] work. They they were doing a little
[3:08:16] better. Joshua give them some pretty
[3:08:19] strict instruction to try to bring them
[3:08:20] and park them on the side of the
[3:08:22] building. It makes makes mowing
[3:08:24] difficult and makes well for me it made
[3:08:27] parking
[3:08:28] difficult. That wasn't in my dream. But
[3:08:30] my dream was to have a place also where
[3:08:33] the children could play and run and and
[3:08:35] and and make
[3:08:37] noise. And uh I I'm going to miss I'm
[3:08:41] going to miss hearing them sometime
[3:08:42] outside my window. I'm going to miss
[3:08:44] them for a little while. Um but I am so
[3:08:48] thankful that we have God's given us
[3:08:51] that kind of a place where the kids can
[3:08:53] have fun. And uh I better I better just
[3:08:56] keep my comments shorter and uh so that
[3:09:00] we don't get too fussy. My goodness,
[3:09:03] you're not a newborn
[3:09:06] anymore. Just a minute. Just a minute.
[3:09:09] Let me just pray. Oh, what if I stand
[3:09:12] close to him? Can I just stand close?
[3:09:14] Oh, I don't want
[3:09:19] [Music]
[3:09:22] to. We'll we'll get right
[3:09:28] here. He's He's a little upset with me,
[3:09:30] ain't
[3:09:32] he? Would you reach your hand this way
[3:09:34] and let me pray a blessing over Baniah
[3:09:38] Arrow was singinger and then his dad
[3:09:40] will dedicate him to the Lord. Father, I
[3:09:43] thank you for this precious little boy
[3:09:46] that you have given to this family and
[3:09:48] to this church family. I thank you for
[3:09:52] the special look that he
[3:09:55] has. I thank you, Lord, for the special
[3:09:59] feeling that we get when we're in his
[3:10:03] presence. It means to me that you've
[3:10:05] called him. It means to me that your
[3:10:08] purposes are upon him. And Lord, I just
[3:10:11] ask that you will protect him and keep
[3:10:14] him both physically and
[3:10:17] spiritually. I pray Lord that the angels
[3:10:20] will just ever as your promise says that
[3:10:24] your angels will just encompass camp
[3:10:26] round about him and keep him physically
[3:10:30] safe. Lord, I pray that they will also
[3:10:33] war against any enemy that would come to
[3:10:37] spiritually touch him in any way. Lord,
[3:10:40] guard and protect that which you have
[3:10:43] placed in him for the glory of God.
[3:10:46] Anoint his mom, his dad, his brother,
[3:10:49] and his sister, and the rest of this
[3:10:52] family. May they be anointed, oh God, to
[3:10:56] guide him, to love him and care for him,
[3:11:00] to bring out of him that which is most
[3:11:04] important and most valuable. I pray, oh
[3:11:07] God, that this little family will
[3:11:09] continue to bring glory to your name in
[3:11:13] everything that you would have for them
[3:11:15] and everything that you have called them
[3:11:17] to do. We pray that it will accelerate
[3:11:20] that it will be
[3:11:21] magnified. We break any work of the
[3:11:25] enemy against them in any way,
[3:11:27] specifically any witchcraft that would
[3:11:30] rise against them. We take authority
[3:11:32] over it in the name of Jesus Christ and
[3:11:36] we call it down.
[3:11:38] Glory be to God. May this little boy
[3:11:41] have the courage of his name's sake in
[3:11:44] the Bible. May he be the one that does
[3:11:47] what others cannot do, not born to do.
[3:11:52] And we'll give you glory and honor and
[3:11:54] praise for it's in the name of Jesus
[3:11:56] Christ we pray. Amen.
[3:12:00] Amen. Let's agree with brother R.J's
[3:12:06] prayer. Father, thank

[3:12:33] faithfulness and your blessing. Yes,

[3:12:39] prophetically. Amen. because he

[3:12:48] earth. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

[3:12:53] life of David and Solomon. He certainly
[3:12:56] was in that transition of power. And
[3:12:58] we're entering into a new day in you.
[3:13:01] And I pray, oh God, for the Banayas to
[3:13:04] come forth. Hallelujah, Lord.
