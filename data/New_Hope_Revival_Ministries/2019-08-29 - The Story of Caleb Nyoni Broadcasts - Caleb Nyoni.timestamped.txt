[0:02] [Music]
[0:09] will you live the Jesus life the
[0:12] Ascended life the supernatural life from
[0:15] the realm of the Spirit
[0:20] [Music]
[0:24] but I've got good news for you and that
[0:27] is God by nature is a redeemer
[0:30] [Music]
[0:36] is surrendering our mind to the word
[0:39] that's what makes the big difference
[0:41] that's the great mystery right twiced in
[0:43] you the hope award
[0:59] praise the Lord
[1:01] this is Pastor Steven Shelley from the
[1:04] new hope revival ministries in Smith
[1:06] Station Alabama I have good news for you
[1:10] today
[1:11] Jesus is alive and well I want you to
[1:16] know that he loves you and he desires to
[1:19] help you in your time of need
[1:21] in fact he paid a price the ultimate
[1:24] price the supreme price for your life
[1:28] and that was with his own blood and I
[1:31] believe today that the blood of Jesus
[1:33] Christ
[1:34] still avails there's still life in that
[1:38] blood if you will repent of your sins
[1:42] and invite him into your heart he will
[1:45] come in with his life and not only live
[1:48] in you but he will live through you we
[1:53] are coming to you again today in
[1:55] partnership with the gospel channel and
[1:58] I know that many of you are blessed by
[2:01] the good Holy Ghost programming that is
[2:04] available to you here on the gospel
[2:07] channel and we just consider it a
[2:11] privilege to be partners with them in
[2:13] helping with the end time harvest we
[2:17] want to remind you that this is a
[2:19] program where we invite you to call in
[2:23] or write in with your prayer requests
[2:26] because we believe not only in the power
[2:29] and blessing of prayer but we believe in
[2:32] the power of God to meet your need I
[2:35] believe that the Lord Jesus is still a
[2:38] healer and he is still a deliverer he is
[2:41] still a savior and I have in front of me
[2:44] a whole stack of your needs your prayer
[2:49] requests and we're hearing from new
[2:52] friends that we haven't heard from
[2:54] before and we are taking these prayer
[2:58] requests before the Lord he tells us
[3:02] that we should come to him that we
[3:05] should cast all of our
[3:07] on him because he cares for us I know
[3:12] sometimes when you're in the heat of the
[3:14] battle it's hard to feel cared about or
[3:18] loved but I want you to know that your
[3:21] heavenly Father does care and he does
[3:24] love you he's asking only one thing of
[3:27] you today and that is that you would
[3:30] surrender your will that you would allow
[3:32] him to come in and wash you with his
[3:36] blood and redeem you and live in you and
[3:41] through you as we said a moment ago
[3:43] total surrender it's it's it's sounds
[3:47] very easy but in practicality it may be
[3:50] a little harder than it sounds because
[3:52] there's always the will of the flesh
[3:55] there's always that Adamic nature that
[3:58] wants to pull us away from surrender to
[4:02] the Word of God and so we we fight a
[4:04] battle just like the Apostle Paul of old
[4:07] we're fighting a battle but guess what
[4:09] we win through Jesus Christ let me share
[4:13] this verse of scripture with you and
[4:15] then I want to introduce you to my very
[4:18] special guest today who is all the way
[4:22] from well born in Zimbabwe but now
[4:26] living in Zambia in on the continent of
[4:29] Africa a full-time evangelist and my
[4:34] what a blessing he has been to our local
[4:36] church body over the past few days and
[4:39] I'll introduce him to you in a moment
[4:42] but this was the verse of scripture that
[4:44] I woke up with this morning and I'm
[4:46] going to read it from the amplified
[4:48] version of the Bible and I say a chapter
[4:52] 54 and verse 17 but no weapon that is
[4:59] formed against you shall prosper
[5:03] now this is a promise to the children of
[5:06] the Lord and you are his child if you
[5:10] have repented of your sins
[5:13] and believed him for the salvation of
[5:16] your soul that makes you one of God's
[5:18] children and if you will walk in
[5:21] covenant with him obeying his word
[5:24] striving to the best of your strength to
[5:28] live the life that he is calling you to
[5:31] now that's not trusting in your
[5:33] righteousness we're trusting in his
[5:35] righteousness but if you can say that
[5:38] this is my life this is what I'm trying
[5:42] to do to the best of my ability through
[5:44] faith then this is yours
[5:46] so you take it with you now but no
[5:49] weapon that is formed against you shall
[5:51] prosper and every tongue that shall rise
[5:54] against you in judgment you shall show
[5:58] to be in the wrong the peace
[6:01] righteousness security triumph over
[6:05] opposition is the heritage of the
[6:08] servants of the Lord that's what we are
[6:11] we're servants of the Lord those in whom
[6:16] the ideal listen to this those in whom
[6:20] the ideal servant of the Lord is
[6:23] reproduced now I love the way this
[6:27] classic amplified version of the Bible
[6:29] brings that out because Jesus is the
[6:31] ideal servant and his life is being
[6:35] reproduced in us this is the
[6:38] righteousness or the vindication which
[6:41] they obtain from me this is that which I
[6:47] impart to them as their justification
[6:52] says the Lord I love the way that reads
[6:57] God is imparting to us justification
[7:03] through salvation and redemption it is a
[7:07] gift to us if we can only believe I'm
[7:11] anxious to hear what the Lord will say
[7:14] to all of us today through our precious
[7:17] brother Caleb Nene all the way from Zam
[7:22] via Africa god bless you brother welcome
[7:25] to our program today
[7:27] thank you very much pasta Shelly good to
[7:29] meet you
[7:30] god bless you so much we are so blessed
[7:33] in the last few days with your not only
[7:36] your preaching your preaching has been a
[7:38] real blessing but I've enjoyed getting
[7:40] to know you and having a little more
[7:42] fellowship with you we well we've been
[7:46] social media friends for a long time but
[7:49] we only met just a few months back in in
[7:54] Easter time in Ghana West Africa where
[7:57] we were preaching and I felt honored
[7:59] that you would take a little time out of
[8:02] your schedule to come and be in our
[8:04] meetings that's very true
[8:06] you know you're younger than I am yeah
[8:09] and I'd like for you to tell the people
[8:11] your age and I would also like for you
[8:14] to just begin to share how you came to
[8:18] the Lord I know you were raised in a
[8:20] Christian home but that doesn't
[8:21] automatically make us Christians does it
[8:24] we have to make our own decisions and I
[8:28] especially love your testimony of how
[8:31] you really had no thoughts of being a
[8:35] preacher right but God had a better
[8:37] thought about you than you had about
[8:39] yourself that's so what you just shared
[8:41] with the people a little bit about you
[8:44] and and your call thank you so much
[8:46] viewers like he said I'm brother Caleb
[8:50] noe from born in Zimbabwe but currently
[8:55] residing in Zambia which is the next
[8:57] country I came to the Lord I'm 27 years
[9:00] old and I came to the Lord in 2013 but I
[9:07] was born and bred in in the message but
[9:11] being born in the message does not make
[9:13] you a believer I have to have a personal
[9:16] encounter with God amen I'm born from a
[9:19] pastoral family and I also felt there is
[9:23] something that I needed more than just
[9:25] become than just being a pastor son
[9:28] right so I came into the Lord
[9:31] and I never wanted to preach because I
[9:34] could see what my father would go
[9:36] through so preaching was never my thing
[9:38] I vowed to God that if I want to serve
[9:42] God let me just do music and I can
[9:44] praise him through music praise and
[9:46] worship but that was not God's plan
[9:48] right God wanted me to Minister the
[9:51] gospel and that's why I'm here
[9:54] absolutely right so in 2013 I had
[9:58] gathered some musicians from different
[10:00] churches they started seeing my
[10:03] leadership qualities when I was too
[10:05] young and I gathered them together we
[10:07] have music days like weekends on
[10:10] Saturday I'll pay for the studio and out
[10:13] gather the youth they would sing so
[10:14] travel sometimes to churches different
[10:17] churches trying to bring unity because
[10:19] we believe that where there is unity
[10:21] God commands a blessing so I remember we
[10:27] used to go for conventions or weddings
[10:30] they would hire us sometimes to do it
[10:32] for free and just to bring you need to
[10:34] among the young people I remember I was
[10:36] driving on the 31st of December 2014
[10:39] traveling to do one of our music it was
[10:43] an overnight service so I remember that
[10:48] day I was driving to a place called bin
[10:50] Dora and I was cruising because I was
[10:53] late and the choir members have already
[10:56] already arrived and I'm supposed to be
[10:58] there so I was under pressure so I was
[11:01] moving at a 160 km/h and it was raining
[11:05] and the road was too sloppy
[11:07] Omar and I approached a certain cave and
[11:11] the certain colleges cross the white
[11:13] line and then I panicked and then the
[11:16] cars veered off the road and I hit the
[11:18] bridge and I of attended three times why
[11:21] but the second time I was thrown out by
[11:23] the window and I landed in the bridge on
[11:26] the rock but I was wearing a suit so the
[11:29] water would come inside of me and I
[11:32] remember it was a terrible thing also
[11:34] hatred I went flat I went unconscious
[11:38] right there and they I don't even
[11:39] remember what happened I only remembered
[11:42] that the car just over tend and then I
[11:44] lost control
[11:45] I lost my mind and I went unconscious so
[11:49] they took my body they put it on the
[11:52] side of the road so that's the time when
[11:55] what's up was introduced it's quite
[11:57] common in Africa but I remember people
[12:01] were taking pictures on their phones
[12:02] instead of taking me to the hospital
[12:05] they were taking pictures with their
[12:07] phones and sending on whatsapp I said in
[12:10] drunken man just came and said wow like
[12:12] this this guy why can't you take him to
[12:14] the hospital and these ladies and these
[12:17] people who had just arrived they said
[12:19] he's already dead there's no need for us
[12:22] to rush my and my other brother who was
[12:25] in the car he was in shock he was just
[12:27] crying crying that I'm dead and he's
[12:30] confused it's in shock
[12:31] so this drunkard was driving a truck he
[12:34] just took me put me in the truck and
[12:36] then straight away we went to the
[12:38] hospital a private hospital called
[12:40] Shashi private hospital in Ventura it's
[12:43] about ten kilometers away from the city
[12:46] so we went there and I remember they put
[12:50] me on a stretcher my bones were broken
[12:52] so the first thing they wanted to make
[12:54] sure was to check if I'm if I'm well I
[12:58] remember I had a cell phone in my pocket
[12:59] and I had a small phone in the big phone
[13:02] but the big phone we lost it so I had a
[13:04] small phone we call it got you know you
[13:07] know you know you know a country it got
[13:09] forward those small small phones so they
[13:12] tried to call my dad he was the last
[13:15] person I dialed
[13:16] so normally my dad before he preaches
[13:19] normally switches off his phone that day
[13:21] he forgot to put it on flight mode Wow
[13:23] and he was about to go and preach mmm he
[13:26] found a phone call coming and his life
[13:28] was calling me this time that was around
[13:29] 7 or 8 p.m.
[13:31] normally in our country when we have
[13:34] 31 December we do in a crossover service
[13:36] right so he was about to go and preach
[13:40] so he receives a call and these people
[13:43] are saying this is we are calling from
[13:45] the hospital we have your son he has
[13:47] been involved in a horrific accident
[13:49] mine and my father has to say how is the
[13:52] situation and they didn't want to
[13:56] disappoint him you know how they talk
[13:57] they're so sweet he's not so bad he's
[14:00] not good it's not bad so my dad just
[14:03] said okay is he talking and then they
[14:06] said we can't say that now my dad says
[14:08] okay remember I'm still unconscious I'm
[14:10] on the stretcher they asked and said
[14:13] okay just put the phone on his right ear
[14:15] I don't need to pray for him he was in a
[14:18] place which is about 140 something miles
[14:21] away Wow and he prayed for me on the
[14:23] phone and I came back to life Wow Wow I
[14:28] started hearing noise around you know I
[14:30] was standards like what am i I was
[14:33] thinking of dreaming and I wake up I ask
[14:35] where am I and I'm on the stretcher
[14:37] so they wanted to do some x-ray to check
[14:40] if I have maybe broken bones or black
[14:44] clothes or inside bleeding so they took
[14:48] me into a special world and then they
[14:51] started checking on me but they realised
[14:53] that the legs were already broken it was
[14:55] really bad
[14:56] and after that what happened was I slept
[15:01] they injected me some injections so that
[15:03] my body could cool down and some people
[15:06] were ahead about the accident they also
[15:07] had to come and see me and some people
[15:10] were also praying that I I could recover
[15:12] so well but I remember to cut the long
[15:16] story short I remember I slept after
[15:19] midnight
[15:20] and then after sleeping it's like I was
[15:22] more like in a dream more like a vision
[15:25] and I was I really truly saw my body
[15:27] lying on on the on the world on the
[15:29] stretcher on the bed and I literally saw
[15:32] my body and my spirit I felt lifted up
[15:35] and I studied feeling like I'm in the
[15:37] clouds and I'm feeling like I'm dreaming
[15:40] then these things are happening
[15:42] literally and then I heard a voice and I
[15:46] was thinking of going up or coming down
[15:48] so what I simply did because that time
[15:52] was already staying alone and I was
[15:53] thinking to say if I die like this what
[15:56] about my mother because I promised my
[15:58] mom to say I'll see you next year
[16:00] meaning tomorrow I was like a job right
[16:02] so I was like I'll buy you some
[16:04] chocolates because I love her so much
[16:06] and she was also think - waiting to see
[16:10] me after a long time because that
[16:12] December we had a busy program so I
[16:16] started thinking if I go without saying
[16:18] goodbye how is she gonna take it so I
[16:22] had a voice which says okay if you go
[16:25] back on earth go and win souls for
[16:28] Christ go and break the good news and
[16:31] win souls for Christ remember I never
[16:34] wanted to preach right I just wanted to
[16:36] be a musician but I'm being told to go
[16:39] and minister so within a split of a
[16:42] second I came back into this body and I
[16:44] felt so heavy and I scream and literally
[16:48] I was sweating that time and then the
[16:50] neces came running oh and they are
[16:52] wondering what's happening with this
[16:53] brother and then I said I want to rush
[16:56] to the restroom because I really need to
[16:59] release myself right now so they told me
[17:02] that okay we're gonna push in a
[17:04] stretcher and we're gonna ask the male
[17:07] nurses to help you I said I want to walk
[17:10] I want to walk right now they said no
[17:12] you can walk you walk tomorrow trying to
[17:13] comfort me right they knew I can't walk
[17:15] because these bones are broken
[17:17] Wow with that power after that
[17:18] experience I just came out of the bed
[17:21] and literally walked but it was slow but
[17:24] I worked and went to the bathroom
[17:26] they were shocked they said what I hid
[17:29] them so me myself I did they never told
[17:32] me your legs are broken and but I
[17:33] couldn't feel my legs before so I went
[17:37] to the restroom then I came little by
[17:39] little I came I walked and then I came
[17:40] back so I had these nurses they came to
[17:44] me and asked me who are you
[17:45] mmm what is happening to you so they had
[17:47] to sit me diet to explain the experience
[17:50] that I
[17:50] then they said this court that yourself
[17:52] is too much we watched it they showed me
[17:55] the the x-ray papers I remember giving a
[17:58] testimony in a mount in my country
[18:00] different churches sharing those x-ray
[18:02] papers and showing how my bones were
[18:05] broken but from that experience it was
[18:08] just a paradox something incredible but
[18:12] yet it's true so the bones in your legs
[18:14] were just mended back together they were
[18:16] mended back together supernatural
[18:18] supernatural so I came back in this body
[18:21] and then I started feeling okay I was
[18:24] supposed to stay in the hospital for two
[18:25] months while they are monitoring me but
[18:28] because of the supernatural in the next
[18:30] morning the first of January I left the
[18:33] hospital Wow overnight overnight and
[18:36] remember I couldn't walk though I had a
[18:39] swollen head but I recovered within a
[18:42] few days my birthday's on the 7th of
[18:44] January
[18:44] remember this is 1 January so I thought
[18:47] I was not gonna celebrate that birthday
[18:49] but I celebrated that birthday I
[18:51] remember wearing a gray suit yeah and
[18:55] people came and I was laughing with them
[18:57] and I told myself that I'll never drive
[18:59] again now that you know after an
[19:01] accident normally people say I'll never
[19:03] drive again but on the third or fourth
[19:05] day I was already driving so that was a
[19:07] supernatural miracle so since then I I
[19:11] was in Zimbabwe then I had to be
[19:13] transferred back to Zambia I went to
[19:15] Zambia and now I want to explain a bit
[19:18] about how I started preaching please now
[19:21] this is the most interesting part now I
[19:25] went to Zambia I reached in Lusaka and I
[19:28] met one of the brothers called pastor
[19:32] piri and he told me that I know your dad
[19:35] is a pastor and could you preach for us
[19:38] I never had preached before and I'm
[19:43] thinking okay what am I going to speak
[19:44] about so he said it was on a Friday he
[19:47] said tomorrow make sure we have home
[19:50] cells and you should come prepared at
[19:53] 2:00 p.m. we gather as families and
[19:56] you're gonna preach for us now basically
[19:59] messages of faith they are very
[20:01] very easy to preach on so I remember I
[20:03] preached about faith and I went there I
[20:06] was so nervous I had so much stage
[20:08] fright and I was so scared to stand
[20:10] before people and I preached and people
[20:14] were literally blessed course they were
[20:16] and after getting blessed what happened
[20:18] was the pasta was so much taged he says
[20:21] you're taking tomorrow service so from
[20:24] home cell into the pulpit on a Sunday
[20:28] morning and I went there and I preached
[20:32] I remember I preached a message called
[20:34] redeeming the time because the days are
[20:36] evil I increase that message it was a
[20:38] blessing altogether and the pastor said
[20:41] you know what we need to promote this
[20:42] gift he called one of the friends in
[20:45] Chama and he connected me to that pasta
[20:48] that pastor asked me to come the next
[20:49] weekend I went on a Friday they received
[20:52] me so well I reached there and it was
[20:55] tremendous after that we had an altar
[20:58] call weird we were to pray for the
[20:59] people so I met a certain businessman
[21:03] and God gave me a revelation to talk to
[21:05] that man and I spoke to him and I told
[21:08] him things that I met him for the first
[21:10] time and he was literally shocked
[21:12] because even if I was being if someone
[21:15] had told me there was some serious is
[21:18] sensitive information that even no one
[21:20] would know and God gave him a revelation
[21:22] I spoke to him and he was literally
[21:24] touched he had a university he needed
[21:27] the license for him to start operating
[21:30] on the University and he was struggling
[21:34] for almost two years the government was
[21:35] not issuing them the license so I also
[21:39] told him that you've been praying for
[21:40] something but from today I'm praying
[21:43] that God will change your situation yes
[21:46] and he believed it and after believing
[21:49] it he went back myself I just went back
[21:52] to the pastors who are supposed to
[21:54] travel back to the capital city then
[21:56] they asked me to extend probably a day
[21:58] or two so I can minister also on Tuesday
[22:00] so on Monday this is Sunday on Monday
[22:04] the government guys
[22:06] higher education of Zambia they code
[22:08] this brother they said we've been quiet
[22:12] but we have thought of you know coming
[22:15] and doing some inspection on your
[22:17] University just make sure we're sending
[22:19] our guys during the week make sure the
[22:22] windows are there the water is running
[22:24] and the toilets are functioning we and
[22:26] the way you obtained you have painted
[22:28] all the buildings we are coming and to
[22:30] inspect Wow the next day he gets this go

[22:35] Nick literally called me he said where
[22:38] are you I said I'm still in coma he's
[22:39] like okay I'm sending my driver to come
[22:42] and pick you send me your passport he
[22:44] needed my my debt of bet and the full
[22:47] names he got me a ticket to fly to
[22:49] Lusaka he said now you're staying with
[22:51] me so we went to Lucifer he asked me how
[22:54] much do you get I told him where I was
[22:56] working he said okay I'm gonna pay you
[22:58] double but we're gonna start staying
[22:59] together well I'll give you a company
[23:01] car I'll give you everything but you'll
[23:03] be staying at my house I can't leave
[23:05] this kind of grace Oh so from the we got
[23:09] a lot of testimonies to share but I'm
[23:11] just sharing this one because it has
[23:13] really contributed to where I am today
[23:16] so I met his wife and the children there
[23:20] in the capital city they're so wonderful
[23:22] family and that was now in 2015 now 2015
[23:28] was going on and on and we were doing so
[23:31] well with this brother and then he saw
[23:34] me as his son because he's got two sons
[23:37] but he saw me as probably his firstborn
[23:40] and he would treat me so well and but
[23:43] the only challenge was now he made me a
[23:45] manager I was now so busy doing a couple
[23:47] of things and I couldn't find time to
[23:50] have church men to go to church I
[23:53] couldn't find time to go and preach a
[23:54] game but I was getting a lot of money so
[23:57] it was not my bed and to remember to say
[24:00] I was supposed to I was told to go and
[24:04] preach right I'm making money but so now
[24:06] yeah to win souls but now I don't have
[24:08] time then I talked to him can I please
[24:10] weekend's go out you'd say yes
[24:13] but of course the the kind of work we
[24:16] were doing construction plus University
[24:17] I was managing kept me so busy that
[24:19] sometimes you travel 900 miles away from
[24:22] the capital city you go very far near
[24:25] the border you're working you're there
[24:27] for two weeks and I'm thinking I'm
[24:30] supposed to win souls I'm getting money
[24:31] but not I'm not attending church I'm not
[24:34] going to church I'm not preaching so I
[24:36] kept on asking him then I asked him so I
[24:40] decided to go this other weekend to try
[24:44] another rural area and I went to the
[24:46] second guy they told me no they are very
[24:48] very good people can just put people
[24:50] together so he put people together and
[24:53] we went he was translating to from
[24:55] English to the local language but some
[24:57] people they don't understand English
[24:58] they're old people so I'm taking too
[25:01] much no you're fine all right so we
[25:04] reached there I preached and after that
[25:06] we had deliverance and people demons
[25:09] would manifest we cast out people as
[25:11] sick when delivered I remember there was
[25:12] an old woman I once posted it on
[25:14] Facebook she was she had rheumatism she
[25:16] couldn't stand for she couldn't walk on
[25:19] her own for almost five years
[25:21] we went there there was deliverance
[25:23] treated up and that was a miracle in
[25:25] that area so we said we're gonna plant a
[25:28] church here and this brothers would be
[25:31] coming since they they really know these
[25:33] people next weekend we try to go to
[25:35] another village but still my boss would
[25:37] say no we need you this weekend so what
[25:39] I simply did we'll post him on Facebook
[25:41] and one of the sisters from Uganda I'd
[25:44] never met her she just sent me a message
[25:47] and say who we attached by the
[25:49] testimonies much she had a business
[25:51] proposal but at the same time she wanted
[25:53] me also to come to their church in
[25:55] Uganda in Kampala so what I simply did
[25:58] accepted to go then I asked my boss my
[26:00] boss said no what you gonna do gonna get
[26:03] you a ticket then I'm gonna preach but
[26:05] what he did because he didn't want me to
[26:06] go he was so scared so he studied like
[26:09] he was no longer paying me because he
[26:13] was scared that if I pay this brother he
[26:15] might not come back so he must not go
[26:18] there so what I simply did he kept on
[26:20] promising he was a sweet talker
[26:22] no you're gonna add no don't why are we
[26:24] gonna do it you're gonna do it
[26:25] you see just a matter of time so two
[26:27] months passed and I'm thinking we age I
[26:30] gotta go that side and he's no longer
[26:33] paying me so what I simply did I just
[26:35] taught this sister know I'm coming but
[26:36] there are some few commitments that I
[26:38] have this is the suspected that probably
[26:40] maybe he doesn't have the ticket so she
[26:43] asked me can I get you a ticket I said
[26:45] yeah sure if you can so she asked for my
[26:48] details I sent her she got me a ticket I
[26:50] told my boss I'm going he's like no no I
[26:53] said I'm going but I'm coming back I
[26:56] went to Uganda the first week was
[26:59] phenomenal testimonies we do some
[27:02] meetings I pre remember preaching Monday
[27:04] Wednesday friday-sunday tremendous
[27:07] people who had spiritual husbands in
[27:09] Africa we have a lot of those kind of
[27:11] things spiritual husbands we have people
[27:15] who some of the issues I can't discuss
[27:18] but they are quite sensitive people were
[27:20] delivered and the pastor was so touched
[27:22] he said I want this gifting to go to
[27:24] South Africa I have friends there but
[27:27] you're gonna get you a ticket to go to
[27:29] South Africa so I called my boss I'm not
[27:31] coming back now like please please I
[27:34] can't even increase the salary I said
[27:36] now I have to do my father's business my
[27:39] I flew to South Africa and tremendous
[27:42] things happened and start getting
[27:44] connections here and there people
[27:45] started calling each other and we had
[27:47] this have we had about this young man
[27:49] have we had how God has been doing
[27:51] tremendous stuff and that's how it
[27:53] started so I never went back then now
[27:56] we're in 2016 and I remember in 2016 God
[28:00] also started doing some tremendous
[28:02] blessings towards the end 2017 2018 2019
[28:08] and God has been so faithful and I'm
[28:12] telling you the truth I've never
[28:14] suffered or never been never a beggar
[28:17] the Bible says I've never seen the
[28:19] righteous forsaken no begging for bread
[28:21] and land to suffer so God has been so
[28:24] good and we've been doing a lot of
[28:27] missionary work going out planting
[28:29] churches I work with a lot of Ministers
[28:32] you
[28:33] in Zambia and of course around the world
[28:35] just to make sure we win souls because
[28:38] we were waiting for that one one person
[28:39] remains to enter so basically since then
[28:43] and that's how we've been traveling and
[28:46] also I had about pastor Steve good
[28:49] testimonies tremendous testimonies and I
[28:52] wanted to meet him so I remember I think
[28:54] I traveled to India if I'm not mistaken
[28:56] and they told me he was in Kenya and I
[29:00] missed to go there
[29:01] so when Pastor they told me that you'll
[29:05] be coming for the convention and for the
[29:07] dedication in our during Easter
[29:10] convention this year I said God I really
[29:12] want to meet this man of God
[29:14] I just felt I'd never talked to him I'd
[29:17] never inboxed him on Facebook but I just
[29:19] prayed and when we went to Kenya my
[29:21] spirit just to Ghana
[29:23] I just loved him and his two sons we had
[29:26] a good time he was ministering so well
[29:29] and many many I remember there was a
[29:33] meeting when I was not feeling too well
[29:34] and pastor Sheila was preaching and he
[29:37] says our God can even heal you right now
[29:39] and there was a sweet spirit and
[29:41] immediately I was healed I've never
[29:43] shared with his gun I was going to do
[29:46] that so I just loved the man and up
[29:49] until when God opened doors for me to
[29:51] come to the United States I elected him
[29:54] on what's up and then he told me that
[29:56] you be very glad to receive me very very
[29:59] happy it was very good news for us amen
[30:02] and we're very glad to be a part of your
[30:04] first trip to the United States
[30:07] I'm really really humbled I pray it
[30:09] won't be the last
[30:10] Amen you know there was something in her
[30:12] testimony this time that stood out to me
[30:14] right and it reminded me of the prophet
[30:16] of the Old Testament right who was
[30:19] getting his refreshment from the broom
[30:22] right and he got quite comfortable there
[30:24] right and all of a sudden the brook ran
[30:27] dry rags because God wanted to move him
[30:30] to the next place that's true it's time
[30:32] for you to move on that's true and it
[30:34] sounded to me like the Lord
[30:35] using this employer of yours the Lord
[30:38] was kind of cutting off the string for a
[30:40] little bit soon as you would go back to
[30:43] what he had called you to do that's
[30:45] the time of your accident that's very
[30:47] very it's so important for those who are
[30:49] watching the program - yes
[30:51] to be obedient - to surrender to the
[30:54] call of God that's very true
[30:56] because it can be devastating to us if
[30:59] we if we keep fighting God's perfect
[31:01] will
[31:02] that's very true I'm glad that you have
[31:04] surrendered and now you're in the
[31:06] full-time ministry yes sir and so that
[31:09] is a different life it's a life by faith
[31:11] that's minutes you're living by faith
[31:13] and I appreciate the Lord for doing that
[31:17] and why don't you just take a verse of
[31:19] scripture you know we still have some
[31:21] time and why don't you just take a verse
[31:23] of scripture or something that's on your
[31:25] heart and just share it with those folks
[31:27] out there who are anxious to hear what
[31:30] the Lord would have to say to them today
[31:32] okay I'm going to share from Festus and
[31:39] Aliens five verse 17 the Bible says pray
[31:46] without ceasing
[31:48] so whatever situation that you have the
[31:51] scripture is telling us pray without
[31:54] ceasing right do not doubt the power of
[31:57] prayer amen when you pray God will
[31:59] change your situation yes the Bible says
[32:02] in 1st 2nd Corinthians 10 verse 4 for
[32:04] the weapons of our warfare are not
[32:07] carnal but mighty through God to the
[32:10] pulling down of strongholds some 60 1
[32:14] verse 2 the Bible says from the end of
[32:17] the eighth I will cry unto thee when my
[32:19] heart is overwhelmed lead me to that
[32:21] rock that is higher than I that's a
[32:24] beautiful one that's a very beautiful
[32:26] one and that rock is Jesus Christ the
[32:31] proverbs 18:10 the name of the Lord is a
[32:33] strong tower the righteous run it into
[32:37] it and is a safe we are safe in God's
[32:40] hand no matter what's personal matter
[32:42] what's pursuing us can I read more yes
[32:45] please play okay all right Jeremiah 1
[32:48] verse 5 before I formed thee in the
[32:51] belly I knew thee and before thou camest
[32:54] forth out of the womb I sanctified thee
[32:56] and I ordained you so God knew us before
[32:59] we came I believe that and that's why we
[33:02] are here today and some 3 verse 3 but
[33:06] thou art all Lord at my shoe for my
[33:10] glory and the lifter of my head man I'll
[33:14] just read maybe two more to just
[33:16] encourage maybe one or two viewers right
[33:19] Philippians 4 verse 6 be careful for
[33:22] nothing but in everything by prayer and
[33:25] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[33:28] requests be made unto God prayer
[33:31] supplication and thanks thank you
[33:34] everything and let your requests be made
[33:37] known known unto God is that because he
[33:40] doesn't know what we need he knows
[33:42] everything he already know already knows
[33:44] everything why does he ask us to make it
[33:47] known why does he ask us to tell him
[33:49] about our need he wanted to be specific
[33:52] you want you to spirit it yes yeah so we
[33:56] are more than conquerors in all things
[33:58] the Bible it tells us that be strong and
[34:02] courageous yes you never leave you nor
[34:05] forsake you amen one of my favorite
[34:09] Isaiah 49 verse 15 it says can a mother
[34:12] forsake a suckling child no I will not
[34:15] forsake you that's what God is telling
[34:19] us today amen that he knows our needs he
[34:22] knows what we want and you never forsake
[34:25] us and be strong and be courageous just
[34:29] pray and God will change your situation
[34:32] absolutely absolutely
[34:33] what if somebody is watching today and
[34:35] maybe they've been raised around the
[34:38] church and they know a lot about
[34:40] Christianity maybe they've been
[34:41] disappointed in churches and and people
[34:44] you know sometimes folks come up with
[34:47] this excuse I've seen hypocrites and so
[34:49] forth so maybe there are people watching
[34:51] who who have never really invited the
[34:55] Lord they've never really surrendered to
[34:56] the Lord to even be a Christian they
[34:58] know so much but they they've
[35:01] experienced so little what would you say
[35:03] to someone who has not yet taken an
[35:06] opportunity to really
[35:07] invite the Lord into their life I want
[35:10] to say be strong encourages our God can
[35:14] do everything I can do all things
[35:17] through Christ who strengthens me him
[35:19] and myself I am a testimony and I've
[35:21] seen God working in my life in the
[35:24] ministry and in many people's lives
[35:26] don't be discouraged I know there are
[35:28] people who might have been discouraged
[35:30] I've tried this I've gotten there I've
[35:32] tried this but nothing is working in my
[35:33] life there is another chance here this
[35:36] morning what do never leave us nor
[35:38] forsake us try him and your life will
[35:41] never be the same
[35:42] that's why he's encouraging us say pray
[35:45] without ceasing Amen we can eat a lot we
[35:49] can run a lot but you can never pray
[35:52] enough that's true that's true
[35:54] that's absolutely the truth yes and and
[35:56] what about healing what do you what do
[35:58] you think about divine healing I mean in
[36:01] your ministry you've seen people healed
[36:03] yes what if someone's watching the
[36:05] program today and they've been really
[36:07] suffering with something for a long long
[36:09] time they prayed and prayed and and
[36:11] still there seems to be no answer what
[36:13] would you say to encourage that person
[36:15] you've already said be strong and
[36:18] courageous and don't quit praying and
[36:21] this is very good advice but what would
[36:24] you say to someone who says I really
[36:26] need a miracle if you need a miracle the
[36:30] Bible says faith is the substance of
[36:32] things hoped for right
[36:34] the evidence of things not seen now you
[36:38] can see the symptom symptoms every day
[36:40] exactly and you say I keep on getting
[36:44] this headache I keep on having this but
[36:47] just believe mint just say I am healed
[36:50] by His stripes I am healed one time
[36:52] there was a woman who had a goiter here
[36:54] and she kept on believing that I'm
[36:57] already healed I'm already healed and
[36:59] one time she was spreading her bed and
[37:01] she touched here
[37:03] she found the goiter had disappeared or
[37:05] a scar so never lose faith
[37:07] don't focus on these symptoms just
[37:10] believe that my healings day
[37:13] last thing there's a guy called John
[37:15] Ryan John Ryan was a blind man and he
[37:17] kept on saying I can see I can see I can
[37:20] see one time I was sitting in the barber
[37:22] shop and people were just saying this
[37:24] brother is crazy and they cut it they
[37:28] were trying to cut his hair
[37:29] guess what he his eyes just opened and
[37:32] he started running even the barber had
[37:34] to follow him you know with that big and
[37:37] so just keep confessing that touching
[37:40] that diabetes it's finished that
[37:41] depression was no longer my curse amen
[37:44] because our God that we serve his extra
[37:46] fat that God he can raise an 18-inch
[37:48] hammer to strike a B which is about to
[37:50] strike you Wow I think that's exactly
[37:54] right so your advice to us is when we
[37:58] have prayed and believed in our heart
[38:00] yes
[38:01] trusted in God's ability and power to
[38:03] heal us yes then we should begin to
[38:06] confess yes I am healed
[38:08] instead of Lord please heal me lord
[38:10] please heal me I am you know once we've
[38:12] asked right do you think it's important
[38:15] then that we just start giving praise to
[38:17] God for healing Lord I thank you for
[38:19] healing me that's it that's it because
[38:22] the moment you praise God in advance for
[38:25] what he's done I need to see a miracle
[38:28] in your life I like it prays in advance
[38:29] yes praise Him in advance God's worthy
[38:32] God's worthy and God has already done it
[38:34] amen that's why he says by His stripes
[38:36] we were huge finished not we are huge we
[38:40] were healed right by his stripes amen so
[38:44] it's past tense right so it's already
[38:46] done just believe keep on confessing and
[38:49] declaring that I'm healed and focus on
[38:53] something else and you really give a
[38:54] testimony you see a miracle in your life
[38:56] absolutely I believe that right we're
[38:59] getting a lot of people from across
[39:02] Europe who are watching the program
[39:03] watching the gospel Channel yes and many
[39:06] are noticing some oppression in their
[39:09] life some are even in these requests
[39:13] here some are saying that they can feel
[39:16] some battles and warfare going on
[39:20] you know sometimes we Christians can
[39:23] sort of present the Christian life as
[39:25] though everything is rosy yeah and it's
[39:28] not always that way there is a battle
[39:30] alright why is that is that because
[39:32] there's an enemy out there I guess who
[39:34] doesn't want us to surrender our life to
[39:36] the Lord so he he wants us to is that
[39:39] does that make any sense he started just
[39:42] gonna lay down and play dead while we
[39:44] take God at His Word so what would you
[39:47] say to someone who feels like that there
[39:50] is a real spiritual warfare going on in
[39:53] their life maybe the demonic is
[39:55] manifesting and some people feel like
[39:57] they're under maybe generational spirits
[40:01] and and and I hesitate to use the word
[40:04] curses but but we know it can be true
[40:07] that the enemy can move from generation
[40:09] to generation until someone says enough
[40:12] is enough what would you say to someone
[40:14] who feels like they're really fighting
[40:17] against another power darkness okay
[40:22] that's a very good one and the Bible
[40:25] says the enemy cometh to steal cue and
[40:27] destroy that's right but I come that you
[40:29] might have life long life abundance more
[40:32] abundantly and the Bible also says us to
[40:34] resist the devil and you flee arrested
[40:37] flee yes now the first verse that as I
[40:40] spoke about the enemy coming to steal
[40:44] your joy cue and destroy it was God he
[40:48] says I come that you might have life in
[40:50] abundance more right now
[40:52] what the devil tactics is to make you
[40:54] feel like you're to show you symptoms
[40:57] the devil wants you to to lack faith but
[41:01] just keep on believing that a modern
[41:04] Conqueror amen and once you believe that
[41:08] your life will never be the same again
[41:10] now there are cases where we have
[41:13] generational curses where you can trace
[41:15] probably let's talk of sugar diabetes
[41:17] you can find a generational maybe from
[41:20] your grand grand dad to your grand to
[41:23] your father and then it's a family chain
[41:25] it's a family pattern I remember one of
[41:28] the times I was preaching a message code
[41:29] refused to be a victim of circumstance
[41:32] sometimes you have to refuse to be a
[41:34] victim of what follows your family
[41:35] example to follow you oh yes you must
[41:37] refuse like in my family I have on the
[41:39] cousin sites they are drunkards and they
[41:42] take drugs but myself I refuse to be a
[41:45] victim of circumstance excellent I said
[41:47] myself I am a master of every
[41:49] circumstance because if you know who you
[41:51] are you don't live under privilege come
[41:53] on now
[41:54] that's right so I just want to encourage
[41:56] someone that be in generational cases be
[41:59] it any situation that's too difficult
[42:01] drug addicts whatever the case might be
[42:04] I'm telling you the moment you just
[42:07] refuse to be a victim of those things
[42:09] and resist the devil you flee away from
[42:12] you the more the more thinking because
[42:14] as a man thinketh in his heart so easy
[42:16] so the more we think to say no things
[42:19] are so difficult this is what happens in
[42:21] my family these spirits they choose
[42:23] themselves and jump and say you have
[42:25] accepted that is so true yeah the Bible
[42:28] says you're snared by the words of our
[42:30] mouth
[42:31] exactly so sometimes we we have more
[42:34] faith expect that we're going to yea
[42:36] have the same problems that are our
[42:39] fathers had we have more faith in that
[42:41] than we do in God's power to break that
[42:43] to break the cycle right I like the way
[42:46] you explain you use your pattern yes and
[42:49] sometimes that's what's the enemy he's
[42:51] just looking to take advantage of the
[42:52] next year that's very true that's very
[42:55] but we can say no more it's not yes here
[42:58] right here underneath the blood of Jesus
[43:01] yes even if those who are watching live
[43:03] you can get healed right now yes if you
[43:05] only believe absolutely yea let me take
[43:07] just a minute to share a few of these
[43:09] prayer requests because we're going to
[43:12] go off the air today by having you to
[43:15] pray not only for these needs but the
[43:17] needs of every person who is watching
[43:19] this program this weekend if it airs
[43:22] again the same God that can move for you
[43:25] today can move for you in the rerun of
[43:28] this program because he is ever more
[43:31] power
[43:32] and evermore the same does this is a
[43:34] caller who has reached out from the
[43:37] program she didn't leave her name but
[43:40] she gave her phone number she watches
[43:43] the program she is very encouraged by
[43:46] some of the faith messages here and she
[43:49] was recently at the doctor and received
[43:51] a diagnosis that she is not happy about
[43:54] in this note she doesn't mention the
[43:57] diagnosis which i think is very good she
[44:00] just said a recent diagnosis that I'm
[44:02] not happy with and I'm asking for
[44:04] faithful people to pray with me that I
[44:07] can be delivered so I like that she
[44:10] didn't put emphasis on what the disease
[44:12] was or the infirmity was and she just
[44:14] said I need people praying with me
[44:16] that's right Lillian has called from the
[44:19] United Kingdom and she has a
[44:21] granddaughter that at the end of the
[44:24] last school year was really being
[44:26] bullied and mistreated by classmates and
[44:28] the summer was okay but now that it's
[44:31] time to go back to school she's going
[44:34] through some anxiety and she she doesn't
[44:38] want to have to deal with those bullies
[44:39] that's a big problem in the world today
[44:41] right it certainly is and also we should
[44:44] remember that many of our young people
[44:47] are going back to a new school year and
[44:50] they need to be remembered some have
[44:52] testimonies that Jesus is Lord of their
[44:55] life and the enemy is certainly not
[44:57] going to be happy with that
[44:58] and I believe that God can use students
[45:03] with a light the light of Jesus to shine
[45:06] in in their classmates life and they can
[45:09] lead them I know when I was in school I
[45:11] was leading people to the Lord all the
[45:12] time I even led my teacher to the Lord I
[45:16] let my principle to the Lord and because
[45:19] we have something that everybody needs
[45:21] right it doesn't matter rich or poor or
[45:23] young or old they need Jesus don't say
[45:26] here is someone who has called hazel has
[45:29] called in and she's really under some
[45:33] pressure taking care of a husband who is
[45:36] not well and she needs to be remembered
[45:39] to the Lord and the enemies you know
[45:41] pressing her and lying to her
[45:43] and I want God to do something for hazel
[45:46] today Rosa Dean is calling because she's
[45:49] on some medication that has some
[45:52] terrible side effects and she needs some
[45:54] strength and from the Lord you know
[45:56] she's got some problems including weight
[45:58] gain and and it worries her and I know
[46:02] people will have a problem like that and
[46:05] sometimes the devil will say well that's
[46:06] your fault and you can't pray about that
[46:09] but right I believe God is concerned
[46:11] about everything that concerns us that's
[46:14] true and she just needs strength and I
[46:17] believe God can give her that and
[46:19] Rosabelle these two ladies here are
[46:21] their faithful callers because they
[46:23] believe in the power of God her son is
[46:26] not well he's still having some problems
[46:29] in his eye it looks like these two have
[46:32] been targeted it seems like picked out
[46:35] to be picked on and I'd like for the
[46:37] Lord to give them some freedom and
[46:39] Richard is called in from the northern
[46:41] part of the northeastern part of the
[46:44] United Kingdom and his mom has passed
[46:47] away many years ago he was kind of
[46:51] transferred into that area
[46:53] and there's some depression and some
[46:55] panic attacks he mentions a sister who
[46:58] is fighting with her health a brother a
[47:00] blood brother who's fighting with his
[47:02] health and he's called in all the way
[47:05] from that part of the UK and Irene from
[47:09] Scotland
[47:10] praise the Lord here is someone calling
[47:13] us from Scotland who's fighting an
[47:15] attack it sounds demonic and you know
[47:19] sometimes people are in churches that
[47:21] don't understand that's true they don't
[47:23] understand so they look at people like
[47:26] they're just crazy but I want you to
[47:28] know the kingdom of light is the most
[47:31] powerful Kingdom that's but there is a
[47:33] kingdom of darkness that's true and the
[47:36] enemy can do a lot of things to to
[47:38] attack people because here is someone
[47:40] who has a torn meniscus in their knee
[47:42] that can be very painful and they're not
[47:46] able to get around so there's a lot of
[47:47] sadness and depression that's coming and
[47:51] they just go on and on God sees every
[47:55] one of these here is someone by the name
[47:58] of Creed II who has a son and a daughter
[48:00] away from God a 28 year old and a 22
[48:04] year old okay you can understand that
[48:06] because you're in-between those ages
[48:08] there right and they're in bad
[48:10] relationship this particular woman has
[48:14] been estranged from her family and she
[48:17] would like to see so she's repented and
[48:20] she's tried to make that okay but she'd
[48:23] really like for the Lord to give her
[48:24] some grace in that area Celia is asking
[48:27] for prayer for her self and her young
[48:30] sons she's a single mother in the United
[48:34] Kingdom raising those children
[48:36] I was raised by single parent my parents
[48:40] were divorced brother Caleb when I was
[48:42] five years old and my mother raised me
[48:44] alone and it wasn't easy so my heart
[48:47] goes out to Celia I believe the Lord's
[48:50] heart goes out to her amen and here's
[48:53] one more this is an arene II who is
[48:56] calling from London and God has moved
[49:00] for her before she knows in the power of
[49:03] God she believes in it and she knows
[49:06] what the power of prayer can accomplish
[49:08] and she's reaching out and it goes on
[49:11] look here
[49:12] some of them are turned in different
[49:14] directions because I spread them out
[49:17] before the Lord when I pray God sees it
[49:20] these aren't these are lives these
[49:23] aren't names on a paper right these
[49:25] needs are legitimate and God sees these
[49:29] needs that's what blesses me he cares
[49:32] about them that's very I'm a pastor of a
[49:35] little congregation here in Alabama and
[49:38] I'm concerned about my sheep but the
[49:41] Lord has given us a bigger outreach
[49:44] right and he has opened these doors for
[49:47] us so these are I feel like these are
[49:50] some of my sheep too
[49:52] and I want God to move for them that's
[49:54] would you just speak some more just a
[49:56] little more faith and then lead us in
[50:00] prayer we've got about nine minutes left
[50:03] just speak a little more faith over
[50:05] these since I've told you some of these
[50:07] needs and then lead us in prayer thank
[50:11] you so much we've had the prayer
[50:13] requests I know there's some requests
[50:15] that are not returned right but God
[50:19] knows what's in your heart this is
[50:21] common to me all that I have in Laden
[50:23] and I'll give you rest
[50:25] so God wants us to have rest and that
[50:28] rests is the Holy Spirit you want us to
[50:31] set to sit God does not want to see his
[50:35] children sick no God does not want his
[50:38] children crying depressed the devil
[50:41] jumping up and down in their lives
[50:44] no God wants to see his children happy
[50:46] amen and like I always say that once we
[50:50] why we are still here on earth we are
[50:52] not going to heaven by running away from
[50:54] depression from sickness heaven is not a
[50:57] refugee camp for cowards it's a less the
[50:59] oven for egos ylist we are here on earth
[51:02] we must overcome we must cause dust to
[51:05] the face of the devil before we go to
[51:07] heaven a man and all this sickness all
[51:10] these infirmities our God is the healer
[51:13] he is the greatest doctor ever that I've
[51:15] ever met it's true his name is dr. Jesus
[51:18] a man never lost a case right he died
[51:21] for us on Calvary and all by His stripes

[51:28] so I just want to encourage you who are
[51:30] watching that all this request there are
[51:33] some who have probably not be able to
[51:35] send some requests

[56:33] in his heart if you'd like to send in
[56:37] your requests or your testimony of what
[56:40] the Lord has done for you today the
[56:42] numbers are there the email is there and
[56:45] you can feel free to contact us we keep
[56:49] these requests we don't destroy them we
[56:51] keep them because we want a point of
[56:53] contact it's not necessary but but it's
[56:56] so helpful to me to have something to
[57:00] lay my hands on and and believe
[57:02] sometimes I beat on them lord I thank
[57:04] you that the work is done and it is done
[57:07] today when you're praying pray for the
[57:10] gospel channel that God will continue to
[57:13] bless our brother Eric Erickson and
[57:16] expand his ministry and most of the time
[57:20] there are needs because television
[57:23] especially by satellite across the world
[57:27] is very very expensive and maybe you
[57:32] know there's not a lot of flashy
[57:33] techniques to raise funds and to get
[57:36] people to partner so I want you to help
[57:39] us pray that God will sustain the
[57:42] ministry of our brother and the staff
[57:45] and just continue to send it out into
[57:49] the airwaves because there are still
[57:51] lives that need to be touched with the
[57:54] gospel
[57:55] if you feel impressed today to partner
[57:58] with this network you know how to reach
[58:01] out to them and they would be happy to
[58:03] hear from you
[58:04] we're just partners in the work of the
[58:07] King one of these days brother Caleb
[58:09] it's gonna be over and God's gonna take
[58:12] his little bride out of this world
[58:14] but until then you said we've got to
[58:16] kick up some dust in the rebel space yes
[58:19] sir I like that I like that disturb the
[58:23] devil yes yes the devil always
[58:25] disturbing us that's right thank you for
