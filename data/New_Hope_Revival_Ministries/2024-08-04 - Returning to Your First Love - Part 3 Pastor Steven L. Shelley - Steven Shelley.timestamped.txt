[1:09:58] anything to give you but we're in touch
[1:10:00] with the one who does I can hear you
[1:10:04] we're in touch with the one who does
[1:10:07] could we just give honor to the word of
[1:10:09] God as we read it this evening and we
[1:10:14] are here to hear the word of the lord we
[1:10:18] don't need just a sermon or uh just a
[1:10:22] message we we need to hear hear from the
[1:10:26] Lord we need a word from the Lord and so
[1:10:30] I'm going back tonight to where we were
[1:10:33] last Sunday and Tuesday night and do my
[1:10:36] best not to spend too much time on
[1:10:39] review because I want us to go somewhere
[1:10:42] else in just a bit but let's refresh our
[1:10:45] memories the Lord is talking to us as a
[1:10:49] church and as a people as end time
[1:10:53] Believers as sons and daughters of God
[1:10:56] that we should make sure that we are
[1:10:59] returning in this hour to our first
[1:11:02] love and if we are getting adjusted to
[1:11:05] the world then no wonder our love for
[1:11:08] him is waxing cold in Matthew chap
[1:11:13] 24:
[1:11:14] 10-2 the Lord Jesus is talking to us and
[1:11:18] he said and then shall many be offended
[1:11:23] and shall betray one one another and
[1:11:26] shall hate one another is there any
[1:11:30] dispute that this describes quite well
[1:11:33] the hour that we're living in right now
[1:11:37] has it also been true of other ages yes
[1:11:41] I'm sure it has but never any more true
[1:11:45] than it is in the hour that we live in
[1:11:48] right now everybody is wearing their
[1:11:51] feelings on their
[1:11:52] sleeve everybody is getting a offended
[1:11:55] and betraying one another and even
[1:11:58] hatred is at an alltime high in our
[1:12:02] nation so many words are spoken to
[1:12:05] divide us and to break us apart instead
[1:12:09] of pulling us together as a nation verse
[1:12:12] 11 and many false prophets shall rise
[1:12:16] and shall deceive deceive many and verse
[1:12:21] 12 and because iniquity shall abound
[1:12:25] down the love of many shall wax cold so
[1:12:31] many shall be deceived and many shall
[1:12:34] find that their love has become Frozen
[1:12:38] love in Revelation Chapter 2 and verse
[1:12:42] four Jesus has just spent the four first
[1:12:46] four verses of chapter 2 um commending
[1:12:51] the first three verses commending the
[1:12:54] Church of Ephesus how they despise evil
[1:12:58] and love truth and have labored and not
[1:13:03] fainted in the work of the Lord but in
[1:13:06] verse four he said nevertheless I have
[1:13:09] somewhat against thee because thou
[1:13:15] Hast left thy first love the Amplified
[1:13:21] version says but I have this one charged
[1:13:25] to make against you that you have left
[1:13:30] abandoned the love that you had at first
[1:13:34] you have deserted me your first love how
[1:13:41] many of you find that to be quite
[1:13:43] serious in 2 Corinthians 2:11 I know
[1:13:47] you're standing it says lest Satan
[1:13:51] should get
[1:13:53] an at Advantage let me hear you say
[1:13:57] advantage of us for we
[1:14:02] are
[1:14:03] not ignorant of his
[1:14:07] devices we could almost be called
[1:14:12] experts because we have been dealing
[1:14:15] with the devil and his devices all of
[1:14:18] our Christian Life we've learned a thing
[1:14:21] or two how many of you have been around
[1:14:22] the mountain a time or two and you know
[1:14:25] how slimy he is you recognize how slick
[1:14:29] he is but thanks be to God for the word
[1:14:32] that gives us an advantage over him for
[1:14:35] we are not ignorant of the way he works
[1:14:39] and then tonight our text will be found
[1:14:42] in
[1:14:43] Exodus
[1:14:45] 34:
[1:14:47] 5-7 and the Lord
[1:14:50] descended in the cloud and stood with
[1:14:54] him him there and
[1:14:57] proclaimed the name of the Lord now
[1:15:01] don't be confused there's just one Lord
[1:15:04] here but he has a name and who better to
[1:15:08] reveal his name than himself so let's
[1:15:12] see if we've got this right so far the
[1:15:14] Lord himself descended on Mount sini and
[1:15:19] he stood in the cloud with the prophet
[1:15:23] there and proclaimed out loud he
[1:15:27] enunciated out loud the sacred name of
[1:15:32] the Lord think of it it's a name
[1:15:36] believed by the Jewish people to be so
[1:15:39] holy and so sacred that it is to them an
[1:15:43] unpronouncable name it is a name with
[1:15:47] with four
[1:15:49] letters and no consonants to tie no
[1:15:52] vowels to tie the cons
[1:15:55] together and so it would read if we were
[1:16:00] to read it we would read the names of
[1:16:03] the letters yod he VAV he and it is
[1:16:08] referred to as the
[1:16:10] tetron and uh we sometimes say Yahweh
[1:16:15] the English Bible says Jehovah but there
[1:16:19] is no J in the Hebrew language so we
[1:16:23] know that this is a transliteration
[1:16:25] ation doesn't matter to us tonight we
[1:16:28] will know if we need to know we can know
[1:16:32] he'll let us know is that right so this
[1:16:35] is uh they have chosen to use the word
[1:16:39] Lord which is often pronounced adoni but
[1:16:43] this is not the Hebrew word adoni every
[1:16:46] time you see the word Lord appear in
[1:16:50] these verses it is the yod V the sacred
[1:16:54] name of the Lord so he descended in a
[1:16:57] cloud he stood with his Prophet there
[1:17:00] and he pronounced he announced or
[1:17:04] proclaimed the name of God that's a
[1:17:09] powerful
[1:17:10] visitation and the Lord then passed by
[1:17:13] him or before him and proclaimed the
[1:17:18] Lord the Lord God merciful and gracious
[1:17:25] longsuffering and abundant in goodness
[1:17:29] and truth would you mind to let us
[1:17:33] repeat tonight uh in English what was
[1:17:37] spoken that day in the mountain would
[1:17:39] you read it with me would you Proclaim
[1:17:42] it with me would you send some demons on
[1:17:44] the Run by declaring the sacredness of
[1:17:48] God the Lord the Lord God merciful and
[1:17:54] gracious
[1:17:55] longsuffering and abundant in goodness
[1:17:59] and Truth can we do it again the Lord
[1:18:03] the Lord God merciful and gracious
[1:18:08] longsuffering and abundant in goodness
[1:18:12] and Truth can you say amen amen now in
[1:18:16] verse seven before we're seated he said
[1:18:19] keeping Mercy for thousands amen
[1:18:26] notice he didn't say in this visitation
[1:18:31] an innumerable number an uncountable
[1:18:36] number he reduced it and he said Mercy
[1:18:41] for thousands
[1:18:44] forgiving
[1:18:46] iniquity and
[1:18:49] transgression and sin let's do that
[1:18:52] again forgiving iniquity and
[1:18:56] transgression and sin and that will by
[1:18:59] no means clear the
[1:19:03] guilty that's the kind of God he is he's
[1:19:07] quick to
[1:19:08] forgive but he does not forget
[1:19:12] unrighteousness amen visiting the
[1:19:15] iniquity of the
[1:19:18] fathers upon the
[1:19:21] children and upon the children children
[1:19:24] children's children unto the third and
[1:19:29] to the fourth generation think of it son
[1:19:34] grandson great grandson great great
[1:19:40] grandson iniquity can travel three to
[1:19:44] four generations in a family until it
[1:19:48] stopped that's the word I'm not making
[1:19:51] that up this iniquity can run from
[1:19:56] fathers to children children to
[1:19:59] grandchildren grandchildren to great
[1:20:01] grandchildren great grandchildren to
[1:20:04] great great grandchildren until somebody
[1:20:07] says the blood of Jesus Christ cancels
[1:20:13] this
[1:20:14] iniquity we repent of this iniquity and
[1:20:18] we send it back to where it has come
[1:20:20] from we put our hands on our children
[1:20:23] our grandchildren great grandchildren
[1:20:26] and we say you Spirit of addiction you
[1:20:29] cannot have my
[1:20:32] children because the blood of Jesus has
[1:20:36] redeemed my family
[1:20:38] [Applause]
[1:20:40] lying it's Authority that is found in
[1:20:43] him may God help us tonight father we
[1:20:46] are humbled by your presence we were
[1:20:49] climbing tonight in Realms of spirit
[1:20:53] when we were singing these wonderful
[1:20:56] songs of praise and worship the the
[1:21:00] particles of the air were charged with
[1:21:03] the glory presence of God we know that
[1:21:08] not because we had a feeling we know it
[1:21:11] by Revelation that when We Gather in
[1:21:14] your name your glory presence is with us
[1:21:18] it's the promise of your word we expect
[1:21:23] that every time we come there won't be a
[1:21:26] regular service but there will be an
[1:21:30] outstanding and
[1:21:32] extraordinary above and beyond blessing
[1:21:36] for each who comes with faith to believe
[1:21:40] that you are the same yesterday today
[1:21:44] and forever we've come tonight not to
[1:21:47] hear from a man we have come to hear
[1:21:50] from you we have prepared our hearts we
[1:21:54] have climed climb the Holy Hill of God
[1:21:56] with praise and worship while we were
[1:21:59] climbing we have asked that our hands be
[1:22:03] cleansed and our heart be made new we
[1:22:07] stand in your presence now with Clean
[1:22:10] Hands and with a pure heart and we are
[1:22:13] ready to hear the word of the Lord may
[1:22:17] it come in whatever delivery you would
[1:22:20] choose and may we have ears and hearts
[1:22:23] to receive it strengthen the voice and
[1:22:26] we will give you praise and honor and
[1:22:29] glory for it's in the name that is above
[1:22:32] every name the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:22:35] Christ Yeshua the Messiah that we pray
[1:22:40] and the Saints said amen you may be
[1:22:43] seated may God grant you Grace to to
[1:22:47] give your undivided attention tonight I
[1:22:51] I'm going to bring an important subject
[1:22:54] I yes every subject from this word is an
[1:22:57] important subject but tonight there's
[1:23:00] something in this that couldn't be uh
[1:23:04] preserved it couldn't be held for
[1:23:06] another time the urgency of the Lord
[1:23:10] said tonight tonight is the night you
[1:23:13] you've got to get this spoken tonight
[1:23:16] and so I don't want to be early I don't
[1:23:19] want to be ahead of God I don't want to
[1:23:21] be late dragging behind him how many of
[1:23:25] you want to walk in step with the
[1:23:27] revealed word of the hour we want to
[1:23:30] stay right up in the seasons of the Lord
[1:23:34] some people don't understand the es and
[1:23:38] flows of the spirit there are times that
[1:23:41] the spirit draws back and there are
[1:23:44] times that the spirit of God flows over
[1:23:47] us as we were singing tonight didn't you
[1:23:50] like that song aren't you glad you're
[1:23:52] not called to be a grave t tender I'm
[1:23:55] glad I'm not called to dig somebody
[1:23:57] else's grave my great-grandfather was a
[1:24:01] real Grave Digger and he did it with a
[1:24:04] shovel and not with a back hole I'm glad
[1:24:07] that God didn't call me to dig Graves he
[1:24:10] didn't call me to tend the
[1:24:12] graveyards I'm glad that he called me to
[1:24:14] carry the voice of Resurrection he
[1:24:17] called you to carry the voice of the
[1:24:20] Resurrection we're here to call the dead
[1:24:22] to life we're here to call Bone back to
[1:24:26] his bone God can take that bleached
[1:24:29] valley of dry bones and raise up a
[1:24:33] mighty and exceeding Army of sons of God
[1:24:38] in this hour and we're part of the
[1:24:41] number we're part of that number I'm
[1:24:46] sure of it I don't need you to confirm
[1:24:49] it because I'm sure of
[1:24:53] it we're not
[1:24:55] novices we didn't get our faith on the
[1:24:58] internet come
[1:24:59] on we didn't run everything through
[1:25:02] Google come on because I want you to
[1:25:05] know that Spirit can really get you
[1:25:09] twisted anybody with me why you can find
[1:25:13] every flavor every
[1:25:16] version and if you're a person that
[1:25:18] believes everything you read if you
[1:25:20] don't have the Holy Ghost and you
[1:25:23] believe everything you read the enemy
[1:25:26] will be able to talk you out of your
[1:25:28] faith but I want you to know he better
[1:25:30] try a new trick for some of us tonight
[1:25:33] because we have no intention of giving
[1:25:36] up or giving in this is the winning hour
[1:25:40] this is the late hour but it's a winning
[1:25:42] hour sister uh was singing the song the
[1:25:46] lord gave her uh this is my time I can
[1:25:50] say Amen this is bride time this isn't
[1:25:53] time to go back to the systems of the
[1:25:55] church this isn't the time to bow to the
[1:25:58] denominational spirits of the Antichrist
[1:26:01] this is a the hour and the time to stand
[1:26:04] on the word and here's where we won't be
[1:26:07] able to fudge anymore you won't be able
[1:26:10] to grab a hold of the coattail of
[1:26:12] somebody else's Revelation and stand
[1:26:15] against the Ws of the devil you'll have
[1:26:17] to be alone with God until he opens up
[1:26:20] the heaven and releases Revelation to
[1:26:23] your life
[1:26:25] and then when you hear Revelation from
[1:26:27] the spirit based on the absolute word of
[1:26:32] God that Revelation becomes a part of
[1:26:35] your
[1:26:37] DNA it's a rewriting that takes place in
[1:26:41] the very DNA and RNA of your
[1:26:45] body and the devil can talk you out of
[1:26:48] church rules the devil can talk you out
[1:26:50] of having picking someone else's
[1:26:53] conviction but he'll never talk you out
[1:26:56] of what the Holy Ghost has revealed to
[1:26:58] you by the word because it has become a
[1:27:02] part of you you have become a part of it
[1:27:06] every cell in my body responds to thus
[1:27:10] sayith the Lord I was built that way you
[1:27:13] were built that way we respond to the
[1:27:16] word of the Lord when it comes not only
[1:27:19] on a faith
[1:27:21] level but on a cellular level the cells
[1:27:25] in my body
[1:27:27] move when I speak when you speak the
[1:27:31] word of the Lord over your own life they
[1:27:34] respond science has proven that they
[1:27:37] hear come on somebody said how do cells
[1:27:41] hear and how do they have memory if they
[1:27:44] don't have ears and they don't have a
[1:27:46] brain I want you to know God made them
[1:27:48] in unbelievable unfathomable ways did
[1:27:53] you know it's possible to have for
[1:27:55] instance breast cancer in other parts of
[1:27:59] your body unrelated to the reproductive
[1:28:01] system or or or to the to the woman's
[1:28:04] system you can find cells of breast
[1:28:08] cancer or cells of lung cancer or cells
[1:28:12] of other kinds of cancer it they can be
[1:28:15] found in other organs of the body and
[1:28:18] for years science couldn't understand
[1:28:21] how those cells traveled
[1:28:24] but they began to understand what the
[1:28:26] Bible said we are fearfully and
[1:28:30] wondrously
[1:28:32] crafted Hallelujah not just by a Divine
[1:28:35] intelligence but by the one true Living
[1:28:40] God and he made our body to be able to
[1:28:44] face and deal with the things that's
[1:28:47] happening to it on the level of trauma
[1:28:50] and so other parts of your body start
[1:28:52] trying to fight
[1:28:54] come on we are
[1:28:57] blessed we have an army that lives
[1:29:00] within us to help fight off what the
[1:29:03] enemy wants to throw on our lives
[1:29:06] there's so much that we could say here
[1:29:08] but I I can't uh I I can't use that
[1:29:11] tonight I have to move on in Exodus 34
[1:29:16] that we just read vers 5 through 7 we
[1:29:19] hear of this visitation that Moses had
[1:29:23] of the of the almighty God the creator
[1:29:28] of Heaven and Earth he came down in a
[1:29:32] cloud he stood with his prophet and he
[1:29:36] declared his own name over Moses I want
[1:29:41] you to know the prophet of God was
[1:29:44] changed in that
[1:29:47] moment there was a there was a
[1:29:50] transformation that took place in Moses
[1:29:53] because now the unknown God the
[1:29:56] invisible God The God Who has no name
[1:30:01] and no form and no
[1:30:04] image now has come down and revealed
[1:30:08] himself to Moses and and I want you to
[1:30:11] know his Spirit responded and his soul
[1:30:15] mind will and emotions responded to this
[1:30:20] Mighty coming down of God and the power
[1:30:24] of that name that was spoken over Moses
[1:30:28] it shifted him in a spiritual manner but
[1:30:32] it also shifted him in a physical manner
[1:30:36] the cells of his body we now know by
[1:30:40] science they adjusted to this new
[1:30:44] reality he's no longer an invisible God
[1:30:47] my Creator is a God who can come down if
[1:30:50] I need him to come down and he can Reve
[1:30:54] his name if I need to know his name and
[1:30:57] that makes me think that he must know my
[1:31:00] name because he found me here on this
[1:31:03] Mountaintop do you understand that this
[1:31:06] yod V is is the Revelation that God
[1:31:12] longs to have real Fellowship he longs
[1:31:17] to have real
[1:31:19] relationship with
[1:31:22] Mankind in Hebrew
[1:31:24] when the when the word Elohim appears we
[1:31:28] know Elohim as the Creator we know him
[1:31:32] as the one who dwelt alone with his
[1:31:36] thoughts we know him as the beginning
[1:31:40] and the originator of everything that we
[1:31:43] know and so when when the Jews used the
[1:31:46] Hebrew to refer to the god of the
[1:31:49] universe or to the god of creation they
[1:31:52] would almost all always write the name
[1:31:56] Elohim because that is how they relate
[1:31:59] to God as Creator and as the originator
[1:32:04] of Heaven and Earth but but they believe
[1:32:06] and I do as well that when God came down
[1:32:10] to Moses and declared his personal name
[1:32:15] over Moses that Moses received a
[1:32:19] revelation in that very moment that God
[1:32:23] is not just the Creator A Million Miles
[1:32:26] Away somewhere in the far expanses of
[1:32:30] the universe but that same God not a
[1:32:33] different God not a different God the
[1:32:36] same God who revealed himself as Creator
[1:32:40] to Moses so that he could write the
[1:32:43] first five books of the Bible through a
[1:32:45] scribe that same God now came down to
[1:32:49] his prophet and revealed himself as a
[1:32:52] God who l longs to have fellowship with
[1:32:56] his
[1:32:57] creation I want you to know that's the
[1:32:59] kind of God you serve I want you to know
[1:33:02] that Christianity
[1:33:04] light out there liit te Christianity
[1:33:08] light it will never be able to convince
[1:33:11] the masses that God is looking for a
[1:33:14] personal and individual relationship
[1:33:17] with them it is only when God becomes
[1:33:20] personal to you it is only when the Holy
[1:33:23] Spirit comes over your life and God
[1:33:26] makes himself known to you and makes
[1:33:29] himself real to you that you recognize
[1:33:33] in that moment he doesn't want me just
[1:33:35] to crawl around and serve him he longs
[1:33:39] to have
[1:33:42] Fellowship
[1:33:44] relationship with me are you with me
[1:33:47] this evening you serve a God who longs
[1:33:51] to spend time
[1:33:54] with
[1:33:55] you not just corporately in a setting
[1:33:59] like this but also
[1:34:02] individually he wants to come he wants
[1:34:05] to come to you in the yard he wants to
[1:34:08] come to you in the house he wants to
[1:34:10] come to you in the vehicle he wants to
[1:34:13] come to you in the church yard not just
[1:34:16] in the church house he wants to be real
[1:34:19] in your life he doesn't want you moving
[1:34:22] on a hopo come on he wants you moving on
[1:34:26] a
[1:34:27] noo your knowledge must not remain in
[1:34:31] the realm of head on it's got to
[1:34:35] drop it's got to come from your
[1:34:38] head to your heart as long as your faith
[1:34:42] remains here as long as your truth
[1:34:46] remains here it's just information right
[1:34:49] good information but once it drops the
[1:34:53] only thing that can make it drop is
[1:34:55] Anointed faith faith can grab that word
[1:34:58] from your knower come on from your
[1:35:01] thinker and pull it right down into the
[1:35:03] deeper recesses of who you really are
[1:35:06] Soul and Spirit and once that word is
[1:35:10] quickened to you in Soul and Spirit in
[1:35:14] the Inner Man you receive like
[1:35:17] Moses a
[1:35:20] transformation from relating to God as
[1:35:24] only a master and we his slaves you
[1:35:28] begin to relate to him as one who has
[1:35:32] invited you to cooperate with his
[1:35:35] eternal
[1:35:36] plan he didn't just create you to serve
[1:35:39] him and when we think of serving the
[1:35:42] lord we often think of subservient and
[1:35:45] less than and not nearly enough and we
[1:35:49] have to uh hope and and work to get
[1:35:52] somewhere else God God doesn't want to
[1:35:54] reveal himself to you like that he wants
[1:35:58] you to know that he could have chosen to
[1:36:00] call anybody that has ever lived on the
[1:36:03] face of the Earth he could have chosen
[1:36:06] them all if he would have desired
[1:36:09] to he could have left you out of your
[1:36:12] family when he was choosing but he cared
[1:36:15] about you before you were ever born he
[1:36:17] knew your name before your mother and
[1:36:20] father ever had manifestation on the
[1:36:22] earth he already knew your
[1:36:25] name he already knew where you would be
[1:36:29] just like he knew where Moses was going
[1:36:30] to be he didn't come down looking for
[1:36:33] him he came down to meet him when you
[1:36:36] receive the revelation of the Quicken
[1:36:39] word for the hour you receive the
[1:36:41] beginning of a
[1:36:43] Transfiguration the beginning of a
[1:36:45] transformation on the inside that works
[1:36:48] its way through to the
[1:36:52] outside amen
[1:36:54] it's a
[1:36:55] process the word that comes to you is
[1:36:58] enough but it's a
[1:37:02] process it's not seeing how many times
[1:37:05] you can go to church it's seeing how
[1:37:08] many times you can have an
[1:37:13] encounter well my faith is not just
[1:37:15] based on experiences mine isn't either
[1:37:18] mine is actually based on the inherency
[1:37:21] of the
[1:37:22] word and when I read the word I read
[1:37:25] that God wants to meet
[1:37:28] man he not only wants to pull you to
[1:37:31] where he is he longs to come down and
[1:37:35] walk where you
[1:37:36] are and he no longer desires to be IM
[1:37:41] Emmanuel a a god with us but his
[1:37:45] ultimate desire from the beginning not
[1:37:48] an afterthought from the beginning his
[1:37:52] ultimate desire was to come down and
[1:37:54] live in you to walk in you you ought to
[1:37:59] be careful what you say you ought to be
[1:38:01] careful what you think you ought to be
[1:38:03] careful where you go because you're
[1:38:05] dragging
[1:38:07] Elohim
[1:38:10] y not only the God and creator of the
[1:38:12] Heaven and Earth but The God Who longs
[1:38:14] to have intimate fellowship with you
[1:38:16] you're dragging him to those places
[1:38:18] you're submitting him to those thoughts
[1:38:21] you're exposing him to those words words
[1:38:24] and to those behaviors and to those
[1:38:26] actions somebody said are you trying to
[1:38:28] strike fear in their heart no Godly
[1:38:30] conviction and
[1:38:33] reverence there is an absence of the
[1:38:35] fear of the Lord in this hour stay with
[1:38:37] me somebody if only a few of you will
[1:38:40] we'll be all right there is an absence
[1:38:43] of holy fear and holy reverence in this
[1:38:46] hour in fact the the most of the fear of
[1:38:50] the Lord that we encounter is an UNG
[1:38:53] Godly and unhealthy fear of the Lord
[1:38:56] It's one that that walks around cowering
[1:38:58] afraid that a that a god of Heaven
[1:39:01] wearing a white wig is going to crack
[1:39:03] you on the head with his big old
[1:39:05] sledgehammer and watch your head Dash
[1:39:08] into a thousand pieces and your
[1:39:10] intelligence spill out like little seeds
[1:39:12] on the ground that's not the right fear
[1:39:15] of the Lord the reverential fear of the
[1:39:18] Lord is what we need to see in our lives
[1:39:21] and what we need to carry in the body of
[1:39:23] Christ a reverential fear which is an
[1:39:26] awe it's an awe it's a wonder that this
[1:39:31] great
[1:39:33] God hallu this great God would long to
[1:39:38] come and
[1:39:40] live in
[1:39:42] me if that doesn't make you want to live
[1:39:45] right and walk right and dress right and
[1:39:47] talk right and spit white I don't know
[1:39:51] what would
[1:39:53] if knowing that God longs to come and
[1:39:56] join himself you you see it's not just
[1:39:59] that he needed another house to live in
[1:40:03] he didn't just want to come and make a
[1:40:04] Tabernacle in you he wanted to come a oh
[1:40:09] should we say should we
[1:40:12] say he wanted to come and join
[1:40:18] himself now I felt you then thank you
[1:40:21] join himself with you you talk about a
[1:40:26] Transfiguration you talk about a real
[1:40:29] transformation when God himself comes
[1:40:33] and he not only just dwells in you but
[1:40:35] he starts calling you to Oneness with
[1:40:39] him it's more than a
[1:40:42] comingling it's a
[1:40:44] transformation you see we were told and
[1:40:46] I happen to believe it that in the last
[1:40:49] day that Jesus was our example he was
[1:40:53] the the word made flesh he was the
[1:40:55] beginning of the father's
[1:40:59] creation before the father before the
[1:41:02] eternal spirit of God created anything
[1:41:06] he created a
[1:41:08] son do you understand that Jesus is the
[1:41:12] beginning of the father's creation
[1:41:15] that's powerful it's wonderful to know
[1:41:18] but when Jesus became the manifested Son
[1:41:21] of God in the earth he was as John tells
[1:41:24] us in the beginning was the
[1:41:28] word and he didn't just say the word
[1:41:30] went out from
[1:41:32] God he said and the Word was was God and
[1:41:38] the word became
[1:41:41] flesh somebody said did you look that up
[1:41:44] do you know what that flesh means did
[1:41:46] did you did you study to see what that
[1:41:49] flesh means guess what it means flesh
[1:41:54] flesh oh I know I know we don't have
[1:41:57] women preachers in this day but but I
[1:41:58] grew up under one and when she would get
[1:42:01] to something like this my old granny
[1:42:03] would say I want you to reach over and
[1:42:05] pinch
[1:42:07] yourself can can I ask you to do what
[1:42:09] big mama would ask you to do if she were
[1:42:11] here tonight reach over and just don't
[1:42:13] hurt yourself come on don't be silly
[1:42:16] just reach over and pinch yourself flesh
[1:42:20] somebody say flesh did you feel it flesh
[1:42:24] the word of God
[1:42:27] became flesh and dwelt Among Us come on
[1:42:33] revealing to us the
[1:42:36] glory of the
[1:42:39] father and we were told that in the last
[1:42:42] days it was the father's plan and I
[1:42:44] believe it lines up with the book that
[1:42:47] the word should become what
[1:42:54] flesh again now when we look at that we
[1:42:57] could say uh that the word wants to be
[1:43:00] fleshed out in us it's okay to say it
[1:43:05] that way as long as you pinch yourself
[1:43:07] and understand that flesh means flesh it
[1:43:12] means flesh and Bone it's not some code
[1:43:15] word for something that is only
[1:43:17] spiritual it's something so powerful
[1:43:23] that we will only be able to experience
[1:43:27] it for a short amount of
[1:43:32] time because even with Glory
[1:43:35] transformation this body and its systems
[1:43:38] were not created to contain for any
[1:43:42] period of time especially eternity the
[1:43:45] fullness of the glory of God brother
[1:43:49] sister we can only take a little of it
[1:43:51] now when that Pres presence comes I
[1:43:53] wished you were here with me when his
[1:43:56] presence comes and sometimes we don't
[1:43:59] know what to do with ourselves right and
[1:44:03] they mock us because we can hardly
[1:44:05] behave
[1:44:06] ourselves and brother brandom tells us
[1:44:08] we should be careful about those things
[1:44:10] we shouldn't get out of so out of
[1:44:13] ourselves that we don't even really know
[1:44:15] what's going on you know we we we should
[1:44:18] a as much as possible we should find
[1:44:21] some some form decency and order we we
[1:44:25] we we shouldn't just perhaps swing from
[1:44:27] the light fixtures more than once or
[1:44:32] twice we wouldn't want anybody just to
[1:44:35] make a pig of
[1:44:37] themselves there there has to be some
[1:44:39] some sort of of order among us but how
[1:44:45] in the world a a man can take a hold of
[1:44:49] a
[1:44:51] power that created Ed the
[1:44:55] universe and flung The Stars out into
[1:44:59] space a God who spat and the oceans
[1:45:04] appeared and he created the mountains by
[1:45:07] putting his hand on the fresh clay of
[1:45:10] the earth that big God that powerful
[1:45:14] expansive uncontainable God wants to
[1:45:18] touch your
[1:45:20] life and then you are Ed by Church anity
[1:45:24] to stand as though you you didn't even
[1:45:27] know you had come into the presence of
[1:45:29] almighty God you you you're to stand
[1:45:31] there like an
[1:45:34] Episcopalian there are too many
[1:45:36] episcopalians gathering around the
[1:45:38] message of the hour we need more
[1:45:42] Pentecostals not by denominational
[1:45:45] system but by
[1:45:48] experience we need some more screaming
[1:45:51] crying shouting nodding acts 238
[1:45:56] babies and they won't stay babies in the
[1:46:00] presence of this mature word this mature
[1:46:03] word will cause them to grow
[1:46:05] up into the
[1:46:07] stature of the perfect man that perfect
[1:46:11] man was not William brandham that
[1:46:13] perfect man was Lord Jesus Christ we're
[1:46:16] growing up into the stature of the Lord
[1:46:19] Jesus Christ so we don't remain babies
[1:46:22] we don't tble forever we we don't lose
[1:46:25] control forever but we never want to
[1:46:28] lose our experience with God we don't
[1:46:31] ever want to quench the Holy Ghost
[1:46:34] because the Bible tells us that sinning
[1:46:36] against the Holy Ghost is blasphemy and
[1:46:38] so we want to be careful not only not to
[1:46:41] blaspheme but we don't want to quench
[1:46:43] him we don't want to cut him off because
[1:46:46] he not only wants to occupy your
[1:46:49] space he wants to become one Oneness
[1:46:53] come on it's Oneness it's a spiritual
[1:46:57] transformation and when he has become
[1:46:59] one in you with you with your inner
[1:47:02] being with your redeemable part it
[1:47:06] cannot help but execute a
[1:47:08] change even in your physical body and
[1:47:12] the word of God to become flesh again in
[1:47:14] the lives of Believers for all my lie I
[1:47:18] believe it I believe it with all my
[1:47:20] faith I don't care what they say I don't
[1:47:22] care what critics say what Skeptics say
[1:47:25] God will never force you to be a part of
[1:47:27] this great move of the spirit but if you
[1:47:30] so desire that kind of place with
[1:47:34] him you've just got to change some of
[1:47:36] the places you're
[1:47:39] walking you can't Wade through the Slime
[1:47:42] and the swamp of this life and expect to
[1:47:46] be transformed into Oneness with Christ
[1:47:49] you're going to have to find the secret
[1:47:51] chamber you're going to have to find the
[1:47:54] Hoopa you're going to have to find the
[1:47:56] bridal chamber you're going to have to
[1:47:58] find the little room inside the tent the
[1:48:00] tent in the tent on you're going to have
[1:48:03] to find that little chamber where you go
[1:48:06] in one way and you come out M Jesus
[1:48:10] Christ and you operate in the authority
[1:48:13] of that name and that name is so
[1:48:15] powerful that it transformed
[1:48:18] Moses
[1:48:20] Hallelujah and he's one of the only
[1:48:22] prophet in the Bible mentioned as being
[1:48:24] like unto
[1:48:25] Christ Moses was a perfect type of the
[1:48:30] Christ to come now how could he be that
[1:48:34] he could only be that because of what he
[1:48:36] received in the revelation of the name
[1:48:39] and the presence of almighty God he said
[1:48:42] I want to be to you the yod V I want to
[1:48:46] be to you the
[1:48:48] Yahweh The God Who desires
[1:48:53] Union and Oneness and
[1:48:56] fellowship is anybody with me now one of
[1:48:59] the reasons why we linger in getting to
[1:49:03] that place is because we have focused on
[1:49:07] only one dimension of
[1:49:10] sin and I want to take just a few
[1:49:13] moments tonight to to point out to you
[1:49:16] that
[1:49:17] biblically
[1:49:19] scripturally sin is not just onefold
[1:49:24] it has more than onefold may I say that
[1:49:28] as the prophet taught us sin is
[1:49:32] unbelief and unbelief is the foundation
[1:49:35] and the root of all dimensions of sin
[1:49:41] all of the attributes of sin can be
[1:49:45] found in the foundation of unbelief
[1:49:49] unbelief is the
[1:49:51] root so you know in in Holiness where I
[1:49:54] came from uh everything was sin and they
[1:49:58] would tell you that's sin that's sin and
[1:50:01] they couldn't agree on on on on what was
[1:50:04] sin but they had some things they were
[1:50:07] pretty sure pretty sure that Coca-Cola
[1:50:09] was sin but they weren't too sure about
[1:50:12] chocolate
[1:50:15] cake and they were pretty sure that that
[1:50:19] uh some were pretty sure that cocacola
[1:50:22] was sin but you could have a Double
[1:50:25] Cola and then the clear soda came and
[1:50:28] they said well surely it it's all right
[1:50:31] and you as you've heard me say you you
[1:50:34] had to wear and I don't mean a head
[1:50:35] covering I mean a hat like a big one
[1:50:38] like a like a you know a big hat you you
[1:50:41] some places you had to wear a sisters
[1:50:43] had to wear a a big hat on their head
[1:50:46] and that got a little out of
[1:50:49] hand because then they needed feathers
[1:50:52] for them
[1:50:55] and so they just couldn't stay with a
[1:50:57] simple little headcut they had to get
[1:50:58] bigger and better you know and
[1:51:02] wider
[1:51:03] and it got out of hand because they're
[1:51:06] all trying to find out just how far we
[1:51:08] can go and be all
[1:51:11] right and then they came around and said
[1:51:13] well long is long if if you cut it off
[1:51:16] and it's still long it's long and they
[1:51:19] they begin to say all kinds of things
[1:51:22] and uh they said well we shouldn't cut
[1:51:24] our hair but if we if we fry it
[1:51:30] off if we burn it off with
[1:51:36] chemical then that ought to be all
[1:51:39] right and they didn't understand that
[1:51:42] none of these things in them themselves
[1:51:46] right we're
[1:51:49] sin the problem was unbelief
[1:51:53] the problem was submitting to the
[1:51:56] authority of the
[1:51:59] word it the problem was a a a problem
[1:52:03] with
[1:52:06] authority and so they would see just how
[1:52:09] close to the world they could get and
[1:52:10] still maintain the title of a Christian
[1:52:14] if that is your philosophy and approach
[1:52:16] you'll never know this
[1:52:18] [Music]
[1:52:20] Oneness the Oneness that I'm talking
[1:52:22] about about is going to hurt
[1:52:25] you it's going to cost you
[1:52:28] [Music]
[1:52:29] something it's going to cost you some
[1:52:32] there you're going to feel at times like
[1:52:33] you're cutting off your own
[1:52:37] arm you you you you'll nearly have a
[1:52:41] funeral for things that you turn loose
[1:52:45] of things that have once meant so much
[1:52:49] to you are you still here yes
[1:52:53] you'll grieve
[1:52:55] them you'll miss them but you'll
[1:52:59] understand that there is nothing amen
[1:53:03] that is worth knowing that you are
[1:53:06] coming into a relationship of Union and
[1:53:10] Oneness with the Lamb of
[1:53:13] God I want to walk with the lamb are you
[1:53:15] with me I want to talk with the lamb I
[1:53:19] want to stroll with the lamb as we have
[1:53:22] sung in years past I want to move in
[1:53:26] synchronization with with the
[1:53:29] lamb that's the Oneness that is promised
[1:53:32] to us and and it takes a calling out and
[1:53:35] a scouring
[1:53:37] message to bring us into that new level
[1:53:40] of
[1:53:41] dedication I heard that Prophet say we
[1:53:44] have gone as far with God as we're ever
[1:53:47] going to go until we're willing to pay a
[1:53:50] greater price and so while some of you
[1:53:53] sit and negotiate with these
[1:54:00] things Amen
[1:54:02] brother while some of you call all of
[1:54:05] your emotions together and have a little
[1:54:07] conference with
[1:54:08] yourself and you decide whether or not
[1:54:11] it's too valuable to to turn loose of or
[1:54:14] or or too valuable you better hold on to
[1:54:16] it while you're doing all of that the
[1:54:18] word of the hour the word of God the
[1:54:21] maturing truth of God just keeps
[1:54:23] marching
[1:54:26] on and it's not going to slow down for
[1:54:28] you to make up your mind you'll have to
[1:54:31] run and catch up with
[1:54:34] him so this is what Grieves me the most
[1:54:37] it's when I see people wasting not their
[1:54:41] time your time is nothing wasting
[1:54:45] his you're wasting his because he moves
[1:54:49] from eternity excuse me into time
[1:54:53] to help
[1:54:54] us and we need his
[1:54:57] help he has no desire to to only uh move
[1:55:02] in time he desires to bring eternity
[1:55:06] into your
[1:55:08] heart you were created for Eternal
[1:55:12] things you were created of Eternity from
[1:55:15] eternity you understand that don't you
[1:55:18] and you are placed and really strapped
[1:55:21] you're strapped by time we're imprisoned
[1:55:25] by time but one of these
[1:55:28] days one of these days so while you're
[1:55:32] negotiating about how short is short and
[1:55:35] how long is long and whether or not
[1:55:37] there were this many that fell off or
[1:55:40] didn't fall off and and while you're
[1:55:42] negotiating about whether or not uh uh
[1:55:45] you you can wear a little of makeup or
[1:55:47] not not not too much or while you're
[1:55:50] negotiating and playing around
[1:55:54] the mature word of God's not stopping
[1:55:56] for
[1:55:57] you it's going to keep right on marching
[1:56:01] on it can't wait for you to get
[1:56:03] emotionally excited again that word
[1:56:07] can't be
[1:56:09] still it just keeps marching on and this
[1:56:12] is where so many in the brandom movement
[1:56:15] have made terrible terrible
[1:56:17] choices because they have chosen to
[1:56:20] build their Tabernacles
[1:56:23] and
[1:56:27] stay so many of them have lged another
[1:56:31] night or two in the plains of the
[1:56:34] Wilderness when the word of the Lord
[1:56:36] came and said get out of her come on and
[1:56:39] come into
[1:56:40] me get into me get out of
[1:56:43] Babylon get out of Babylon get out of
[1:56:47] confusion and come to me not just come
[1:56:51] to me yeah come into
[1:56:56] me you were chosen in
[1:56:59] him you were in him when you were chosen
[1:57:03] and you're going to be in him when
[1:57:05] you're
[1:57:07] finished that's right yeah yes sir amen
[1:57:11] so we are only dealing with a little
[1:57:14] part of sin which is unbelief that's the
[1:57:16] foundation of all sin all of these other
[1:57:19] things are attributes of sin but the
[1:57:21] Bible is pretty clear here I don't have
[1:57:24] time to go through all the verses let's
[1:57:25] see it's 7:55 I don't have time to go
[1:57:28] through all the verses but you'd be
[1:57:30] surprised at how many times in English
[1:57:33] in the Old Testament sin iniquity and
[1:57:36] transgression shows up in the same
[1:57:39] verse all of it falling under the
[1:57:42] blanket of sin all of the root of it is
[1:57:45] unbelief please understand I'm not
[1:57:49] disputing what we've heard sin is
[1:57:51] unbelief belie it's an unbelief problem
[1:57:55] that leads to
[1:57:57] sin but but sin in
[1:58:00] itself
[1:58:02] lays spiritually on the
[1:58:06] surface and if we had time we'd go to
[1:58:08] Isaiah 55 we would talk about uh the
[1:58:12] wounding the stripes is that 54 or
[1:58:15] 55 uh the wounding and the stripes and
[1:58:18] the transgression bruised for our
[1:58:21] iniquities and the chat but we we don't
[1:58:23] have that time now but we will go back
[1:58:25] and and perhaps hit that another time I
[1:58:28] want to show you as quickly as I'm
[1:58:31] capable of doing that when we look at
[1:58:34] many of these scriptures we find that
[1:58:36] there are three distinct Hebrew words
[1:58:40] that are used here for sin translated in
[1:58:43] English as Sin iniquity and
[1:58:46] transgression or sin transgression and
[1:58:49] iniquity and when we look at them
[1:58:51] carefully in the original language we
[1:58:53] come to find out that they actually seem
[1:58:57] to represent increasing
[1:59:00] levels of falling
[1:59:02] short of the glory of God you see Romans
[1:59:07] 3:23 indict us all for all have
[1:59:13] sinned all have been victim to
[1:59:17] unbelief for all have sinned and come
[1:59:21] short
[1:59:23] of the glory of God do you understand
[1:59:26] that in Leviticus oh stay with me please
[1:59:32] Leviticus
[1:59:35] 16:21 this is the scripture about aaz
[1:59:41] the
[1:59:42] scapegoat and Aaron the high priest
[1:59:46] shall lay both his hands upon the head
[1:59:50] of the live goat and confess over him
[1:59:55] all the
[1:59:57] iniquities
[1:59:59] of children the children of Israel and
[2:00:03] all
[2:00:04] their transgressions in all their sin
[2:00:09] sin is the is the unbelief it's the root
[2:00:13] of it all and upon that or
[2:00:16] transgressions and
[2:00:18] iniquities all three phases of
[2:00:22] unrighteousness were to be
[2:00:24] pronounced and symbolically placed on
[2:00:28] the head of the goat and the Goat the
[2:00:31] scapegoat was to be sent Away by the
[2:00:35] hand of a fit man Into the Wilderness
[2:00:38] are you familiar with how that took
[2:00:40] place nearing the day of atonement we
[2:00:43] understand the fall feast and how these
[2:00:45] things seem to come together now if you
[2:00:49] will put up for me if you happen to to
[2:00:52] put the other Leviticus
[2:00:54] 16:21 that I gave you that has the it
[2:00:58] has the Hebrew numbers uh put in I don't
[2:01:01] know if you all uh if I made it I didn't
[2:01:04] didn't make a note of anything but did
[2:01:05] you happen to put that one in so that
[2:01:08] the people could see I gave that to you
[2:01:10] because I just wanted the people to see
[2:01:13] the Hebrew number plugged in to show you
[2:01:17] that each of those words sin iniquity
[2:01:20] and transgression has its own Hebrew
[2:01:23] word with its own Hebrew number and if
[2:01:26] you didn't do that that's perfectly fine
[2:01:28] for instance in iniquities is Hebrew
[2:01:33] 5771 uh and then all their trans not yet
[2:01:38] all their
[2:01:39] transgressions was Hebrew
[2:01:44] 6588 even all their sins is Hebrew
[2:01:50] 2403 do does anybody
[2:01:52] understand those numbers they are
[2:01:54] numbers of Hebrew words and Greek words
[2:01:58] they appear that way in Strong's
[2:02:01] Concordance his numbering system is one
[2:02:03] of the ones that's used throughout most
[2:02:06] of the Bible resources when you get into
[2:02:09] a little bit higher level of study you
[2:02:11] may find the numbers vary just a little
[2:02:14] bit if you're using uh thank you so much
[2:02:17] if you're using a different form of a
[2:02:19] Hebrew lexicon or a Greek Lexicon of
[2:02:23] course it doesn't show the contrast uh
[2:02:26] that it does in my notes because we only
[2:02:28] have really one color to deal with here
[2:02:31] but notice that each one of these words
[2:02:35] iniquity sin and transgression all has
[2:02:39] its own Hebrew
[2:02:42] word therefore its own Hebrew number now
[2:02:46] words in Hebrew can be similar they can
[2:02:49] be cousins
[2:02:52] and one they can be brothers and sisters
[2:02:55] one can be the root of another but each
[2:02:59] time a slightly different word slightly
[2:03:03] different pronunciation and a different
[2:03:06] number is a signed so that you will know
[2:03:10] that this is a different degree of the
[2:03:14] root so the root word is here and there
[2:03:18] may be many other words that are laid on
[2:03:21] on top of that root to indicate degrees
[2:03:25] for instance the word
[2:03:28] hatred when English says God hates you
[2:03:33] want to look and see how that hatred
[2:03:36] appears in the original language because
[2:03:39] it could possibly be uh hatred can
[2:03:44] possibly be in its root form
[2:03:48] dislike wouldn't that make people happy
[2:03:51] if sin was just something he
[2:03:54] disliked but when you start looking a
[2:03:56] little deeper there you'll find out that
[2:03:59] there are degrees of God's hatred and
[2:04:04] disgust in fact the Bible says there are
[2:04:07] certain things that are an
[2:04:11] Abomination you know that word
[2:04:13] Abomination yes it means abor yes a BH R
[2:04:18] abhor it's the strongest degree of
[2:04:23] hate God may say I hate such and such
[2:04:27] and such but if he says I abhor it or it
[2:04:32] is an Abomination to me you must know
[2:04:36] that it is the strongest
[2:04:38] degree of hatred that God has in his in
[2:04:42] in in his
[2:04:43] ability he doesn't just dislike
[2:04:46] it now when the Bible tells
[2:04:49] us that it is an abomination
[2:04:52] for a woman to wear that which
[2:04:55] pertaineth to a man or a man to put on a
[2:04:58] woman's garment or vice versa the word
[2:05:02] that is used there is
[2:05:05] abomination strongest degree of
[2:05:09] hatred God
[2:05:13] abhor he hates it in
[2:05:17] context the word that is used there is
[2:05:20] likely referring to a soldier's
[2:05:28] uniform so the church at large they say
[2:05:33] this couldn't have any meaning
[2:05:35] today because women are not trying to
[2:05:40] wear Soldiers uniform well they
[2:05:46] are they are doing it sir but remember
[2:05:51] remember this isn't just something God
[2:05:54] said I don't care
[2:05:56] for it's something that God said I abore
[2:05:59] it's an
[2:06:00] Abomination to me I hate it to the to
[2:06:02] the to the strongest degree are there
[2:06:05] any Holiness people here
[2:06:07] tonight to the strongest degree I hate
[2:06:10] it so we've got to discover if that has
[2:06:12] any application for us today amen you
[2:06:16] see there are certain things that that
[2:06:18] we can't really find how we would apply
[2:06:21] them to our life today because there's
[2:06:23] no Temple standing you and I have become
[2:06:26] the temple amen of the most high God and
[2:06:30] so there are certain laws and
[2:06:32] Commandments that apply to Temple
[2:06:35] Ministry and to the offering and
[2:06:37] sacrificial system that we wouldn't
[2:06:39] really know how to apply to our everyday
[2:06:42] life and that's why modern Judaism has
[2:06:46] built these fences we we learn around
[2:06:49] the Commandments with some
[2:06:51] interpretation to try to tell us what it
[2:06:54] could possibly mean so that we don't
[2:06:57] ever cross up those Commandments are you
[2:07:01] following me and you know this because
[2:07:03] the the Bible says that you should not
[2:07:06] see a kid in its mother's milk you
[2:07:11] shouldn't boil a calf in its mother's
[2:07:15] milk what does it mean it means exactly
[2:07:17] what it says and any of you Farmers or
[2:07:21] any of you that have cared for Animals
[2:07:24] surely you understand that there must be
[2:07:28] some sense of morality come on even
[2:07:32] though an animal has no soul there must
[2:07:35] be some sense of care and concern and
[2:07:40] even morality that we would show toward
[2:07:45] even an animal created to serve us
[2:07:49] [Music]
[2:07:51] and it just doesn't seem uh to to be
[2:07:55] right here is a is a mother cow giving
[2:08:00] you
[2:08:01] milk and has just given birth to a
[2:08:04] little calf and you take that calf and
[2:08:07] you go out and kill it because you want
[2:08:09] to eat
[2:08:11] ve and you decide I'm going to use the
[2:08:16] mother's
[2:08:18] milk as an ingredient
[2:08:21] to
[2:08:23] prepare the veil the baby cap it just
[2:08:29] doesn't
[2:08:30] seem
[2:08:35] right it's like serving Fried Chicken to
[2:08:39] a
[2:08:42] chicken it just doesn't seem right and
[2:08:46] the laws some of the laws were set in
[2:08:49] place to teach us us that there should
[2:08:52] be a measure of Morality In all of God's
[2:08:56] kingdom and all of his
[2:08:59] creation but the Jews because they
[2:09:01] didn't quite get exactly what this
[2:09:03] commandment was about today not being
[2:09:06] very many farmers among them so they
[2:09:08] start making these fences and they say
[2:09:11] that it is a a a a transgression of a
[2:09:15] commandment to eat meat and dairy
[2:09:19] together the mother representing the
[2:09:22] meat and the kid representing uh I mean
[2:09:25] the the baby the ve representing the
[2:09:27] meat and the mother's milk representing
[2:09:29] the dairy now for me that's a stretch
[2:09:34] right but their
[2:09:36] desire was to make sure that you don't
[2:09:40] transgress what you don't completely
[2:09:42] understand so there are many different
[2:09:44] levels of Commandments and some people
[2:09:47] say I thought we were under grace and so
[2:09:49] none of the Commandments of apply but
[2:09:52] may I just say this God may have changed
[2:09:56] the
[2:09:58] dispensation from a dispensation of the
[2:10:01] deadness of the law to the living
[2:10:04] reality of Grace yes sir that doesn't
[2:10:08] necessarily mean that God has now
[2:10:11] decided that what I once
[2:10:14] [Music]
[2:10:16] hated I will now
[2:10:19] tolerate so there are certain certain
[2:10:21] things that are an Abomination to the
[2:10:23] Lord a proud look yes
[2:10:27] sir a lying
[2:10:29] tongue one who SWS Discord among the
[2:10:33] Brethren and when a woman wears that
[2:10:36] which pertaineth to a man not the same
[2:10:37] verse not the same chapter not the same
[2:10:40] book but the same
[2:10:43] word this it's an
[2:10:45] Abomination God said I hate that he
[2:10:49] wanted to make sure that that we
[2:10:52] understand the difference in the
[2:10:57] genders not binary like they say today
[2:11:01] are my pronouns are them and there I
[2:11:03] want you to know that I cannot help but
[2:11:05] cackle laugh out loud right when someone
[2:11:09] says my pronouns are them and their yeah
[2:11:14] and you want to say where are the rest
[2:11:16] of y'all
[2:11:21] plural pronouns for a singular
[2:11:24] individual now you
[2:11:26] know that God saw that as that Spirit
[2:11:31] would begin to
[2:11:36] mature that it would not just be slacks
[2:11:39] and a
[2:11:40] skirt but it would be so wicked and so
[2:11:45] awful and evil that they would wear uh
[2:11:49] the wrong underclothes
[2:11:54] and not on the
[2:11:56] inside but even on the
[2:12:00] outside they would go to town women go
[2:12:03] to town in boxer
[2:12:07] shorts men's
[2:12:10] underwear that's not made to be M's
[2:12:14] quiet it's not made to be on the outside
[2:12:17] you're supposed to cover that stuff
[2:12:19] up and we're not living in the in in in
[2:12:23] the clabo
[2:12:25] days roll them up roll them up girlies
[2:12:28] we're not living in that hour we've got
[2:12:30] to maintain a sense of modesty and we
[2:12:34] must be a shining example to a world
[2:12:36] around us that if God hated for a woman
[2:12:40] to put on a Man's
[2:12:42] armor as a soldier in the Army he said I
[2:12:46] hate that that's the word that used
[2:12:48] right that seems to be the context of of
[2:12:51] that scripture then there's something
[2:12:53] deeper at stake here it's not just a
[2:12:56] woman pretending to be a soldier that he
[2:12:58] has a problem with it's the blending of
[2:13:01] the
[2:13:04] genders like Grace Jones and some of
[2:13:08] those who came on the scene many years
[2:13:10] ago who couldn't know they didn't seem
[2:13:13] to know which they were and now we're
[2:13:16] living in an hour that what has been uh
[2:13:18] uh you know relegated to the closet
[2:13:22] and to private is now
[2:13:26] paraded on the streets of this nation on
[2:13:30] and the church says we've got to be
[2:13:32] tolerant and
[2:13:34] inclusive well then we've got to figure
[2:13:37] out quickly how to hate the sin and
[2:13:40] Reach In Love For The
[2:13:43] Sinner on because we must not compromise
[2:13:47] with a spirit that confuses the genders
[2:13:53] and it must go all the way through the
[2:13:54] scripture because here we come to the
[2:13:56] New Testament and God said I suffer not
[2:13:59] a woman to
[2:14:00] teach nor to usurp authority over a man
[2:14:04] just a further
[2:14:06] installment of the
[2:14:12] distinction oh somebody said you don't
[2:14:14] think a woman can preach like a man oh
[2:14:16] my goodness you've never heard me say
[2:14:19] that
[2:14:21] I think some of the greatest preaching
[2:14:23] that I've ever heard in my
[2:14:25] life women did
[2:14:28] it but that doesn't mean that they
[2:14:30] should have or that they were supposed
[2:14:36] to oh wow I know you're holier than I am
[2:14:41] and you would never be able to say that
[2:14:43] you receive something under a woman's
[2:14:45] Ministry but remember this little
[2:14:47] message that the prophet came to us with
[2:14:49] uh doing God the
[2:14:52] service without being in the center of
[2:14:54] his
[2:14:55] will and uh so just because they do it
[2:15:01] well and with greater compassion and
[2:15:05] determination and a lot quicker they say
[2:15:08] yes a lot
[2:15:11] quicker than old stubborn men folks
[2:15:15] doesn't mean they should do it because
[2:15:17] from the Old Testament Torah all the way
[2:15:22] through the Book of Revelation there are
[2:15:24] principles that we must see maintain and
[2:15:27] one of them is that genders should be
[2:15:31] kept separate their hair should be
[2:15:34] maintained
[2:15:35] differently their clothing should be
[2:15:38] different and of course somebody would
[2:15:41] come along and say I don't get my
[2:15:43] britches in the men's department and I
[2:15:45] don't I don't do this and that and the
[2:15:47] other I'm not interested in where you
[2:15:48] buy them I'm interested in what they
[2:15:50] pertain Ain to that's what the verse
[2:15:53] says what they pertain to and so we got
[2:15:57] to watch some of this
[2:16:00] stuff because there's a perversion that
[2:16:03] works its way into this
[2:16:06] hour and it if you think the church will
[2:16:09] not be touched Church won't be touched
[2:16:11] by that kind of oh yes it will yes it
[2:16:14] will now let's get back to the subject
[2:16:16] at hand please for forgive me for taking
[2:16:19] extra time but please don't forgive me
[2:16:21] for what I just said because I'm making
[2:16:23] no apology for it none whatsoever you
[2:16:27] you understand none no apology at all
[2:16:30] now let's look at the word sin quickly
[2:16:33] oh my oh
[2:16:36] my Hebrew 2403 sin an offense as in a
[2:16:42] single event sin is anything that comes
[2:16:47] short of the glory of God
[2:16:51] anytime unbelief takes a hold and leads
[2:16:55] out of your life it causes you to come
[2:16:59] short of the glory of God it could fall
[2:17:02] under Hebrew
[2:17:04] 2403 translated into English simply sin
[2:17:09] we don't want any part of sin we want
[2:17:12] the sin problem solved we want the
[2:17:15] unbelief out of our life so that we can
[2:17:18] move forward can you say Amen
[2:17:21] now in Hebrew the meaning of sin is this
[2:17:25] slipping away from where you should
[2:17:31] be you see there's a path to walk in and
[2:17:35] when you when your feet start slipping
[2:17:38] around and you start stepping off the
[2:17:41] The
[2:17:42] Path sometimes it's just a steady
[2:17:44] yourself but you're getting off the
[2:17:47] track the Hebrew understanding of sin is
[2:17:50] it's just
[2:17:51] that just slipping from the road from
[2:17:56] the path do you follow me it can also
[2:18:00] mean airing From the Path on which God's
[2:18:05] put
[2:18:06] you if God has put you on a path and you
[2:18:09] start wandering off of that path you see
[2:18:12] it may not be a Commandment that you
[2:18:14] step away from it may be a
[2:18:18] calling you you may be a Jonah
[2:18:22] trying to run from your
[2:18:24] call you might be a man or woman running
[2:18:27] from the presence of the Lord and that
[2:18:30] in itself qualifies under the Hebrew
[2:18:34] understanding of
[2:18:36] sin to run in the opposite direction I
[2:18:40] know you're sleepy and you're hungry and
[2:18:42] give me some more time would
[2:18:45] you I I I I just just stepping away from
[2:18:50] God's divine call on your life can be
[2:18:52] considered under the Hebrew
[2:18:54] understanding sin and what is the
[2:18:57] foundation of sin unbelief so unbelief
[2:19:00] would cause you to step out how do you
[2:19:04] know so much about stepping out of God's
[2:19:06] I've done
[2:19:07] it and I'm not boasting about it I've
[2:19:10] done it I've stepped out of my calling
[2:19:14] and when you do that you can get in big
[2:19:17] trouble with God because it's the same
[2:19:19] thing as slipping away away from a
[2:19:21] commandment according to the Hebrew
[2:19:23] understanding in the Bible this Old
[2:19:25] Testament was written in the Hebrew
[2:19:26] language number three you are not
[2:19:29] achieving a standard that God has set
[2:19:31] for your life that that's considered in
[2:19:34] the Hebrew concept of the word s sin
[2:19:37] it's sin when you are not raising your
[2:19:40] life up to the standard that God has
[2:19:43] called you to that's right which is a
[2:19:46] spirit of Excellence I want you to know
[2:19:48] that God didn't call you to be a
[2:19:50] mediocre Christian no a lukewarm
[2:19:53] believer a Pew
[2:19:56] [Music]
[2:19:59] warer he called you to operate like
[2:20:02] Daniel with an excellent spirit amen and
[2:20:07] when you're not moving in that Spirit of
[2:20:09] Excellence you're not achieving the
[2:20:11] standard that God has set for you
[2:20:13] according to the Hebrew Bible you're
[2:20:16] you're sinning you're under the curse of
[2:20:19] sin right because sin is unbelief and
[2:20:22] what makes us do something like that is
[2:20:24] it's it's unbelief it also means missing
[2:20:28] the Mark or the path any voluntary
[2:20:33] transgression of the Divine Law or
[2:20:36] violation of a Divine command the
[2:20:39] biblical concept of sin consists not
[2:20:43] only of
[2:20:45] actions but also of neglect
[2:20:53] of
[2:20:54] known
[2:20:57] Duty when a father refuses to be a
[2:21:00] father when a mother refuses to be a
[2:21:03] mother right when a husband refuses to
[2:21:06] be a husband or a wife refuses to be a
[2:21:11] wife when a preacher refuses to
[2:21:14] preach and a singer refuses to sing
[2:21:17] right and a musician sits on their gift
[2:21:21] amen when an amener takes a vacation
[2:21:24] from from supporting and backing the
[2:21:26] word of
[2:21:28] God anytime we we step
[2:21:32] away there are sins of commission and
[2:21:36] sins of omission and in Hebrew this
[2:21:39] concept is very clear you are not only
[2:21:42] guilty of unbelief when you do something
[2:21:45] contrary to the law you are guilty of
[2:21:48] unbelief when you fail to do something
[2:21:50] something that God is asking you to do
[2:21:53] and you know what folks the the most
[2:21:55] that God is asking of you is to give him
[2:21:57] your
[2:22:05] life are you listening yes sir so
[2:22:09] neglect of known duty all evil thoughts
[2:22:12] purposes words and desires whatever is
[2:22:16] contrary to God's commands or laws this
[2:22:20] Falls under the Hebrew understanding of
[2:22:23] the word and concept of just sin s i n
[2:22:28] the biblical concept okay now therefore
[2:22:31] we can say that brother brandham his
[2:22:34] Revelation that sin is unbelief is an
[2:22:37] accurate summary of all that sin can be
[2:22:42] including its origins in the hearts of
[2:22:45] men and women so it all starts with
[2:22:48] unbelief are you there yes
[2:22:51] the Greek meaning of sin is a missing of
[2:22:55] the mark very similar very similar when
[2:22:58] you read the word sin I think you have
[2:23:00] that when you read the word sin in the
[2:23:03] New Testament it means something very
[2:23:05] similar to the word sin in the Old
[2:23:08] Testament in the New Testament it means
[2:23:10] a missing of the mark number one number
[2:23:13] two it means an act and I might not have
[2:23:16] given it to you so don't worry an act of
[2:23:19] disobedience to the Divine Lord to the
[2:23:22] to the Divine Creator you might find it
[2:23:26] interesting that the English word for
[2:23:28] sin we've talked about the Hebrew word
[2:23:30] and the Greek now we talk about the
[2:23:32] English word for a moment the English
[2:23:34] word of sin comes from
[2:23:37] [Music]
[2:23:38] archery in
[2:23:40] archery the Archer
[2:23:43] aims at the
[2:23:45] Target he draws back the string of the
[2:23:49] bow placing the arrow in position he
[2:23:53] aims at the center of the target the
[2:23:58] bullseye that's what he wants to hit
[2:24:02] sometimes he knows that his bow has to
[2:24:04] be
[2:24:06] adjusted and he hadn't had a chance to
[2:24:08] have it completely sighted so he has to
[2:24:11] adjust just a little because he learns
[2:24:15] the way that his Arrow
[2:24:19] Falls it's pretty important this stuff
[2:24:22] so he draws back and in just the right
[2:24:25] time he releases the string sending the
[2:24:29] arrow to its
[2:24:31] Target in the early days of organized
[2:24:34] archery the person who was the official
[2:24:38] over the competition when he saw that an
[2:24:42] arrow had missed the bullseye he yelled
[2:24:46] sin
[2:24:51] because the concept in English of sin is
[2:24:55] aiming at a
[2:24:57] Target but missing the
[2:25:01] bullseye what is our answer our answer
[2:25:04] Lord is for all have come short of the
[2:25:07] glory of God we've all at times in our
[2:25:11] life aimed and missed the Mark here is
[2:25:15] the key we don't quit
[2:25:18] trying we don't quit crying out to God
[2:25:22] we don't quit
[2:25:24] practicing we keep working until we get
[2:25:27] it right we keep strengthening ourselves
[2:25:31] in the presence of the
[2:25:34] Lord saturating ourselves with his glory
[2:25:38] and his anointing until we become
[2:25:40] strengthened in the Inner Man so that we
[2:25:43] know exactly how to hit the target
[2:25:50] that's right every time are you still
[2:25:53] with me oh a few more
[2:25:57] minutes then we look at the word transg
[2:25:59] transgression really quickly it's a
[2:26:01] Greek
[2:26:02] word it's it's uh it it's a primitive
[2:26:07] root it's also uh it's also translated
[2:26:10] from a Hebrew
[2:26:11] word it it
[2:26:14] means to stride it it comes from a root
[2:26:17] word see here you can see an example
[2:26:20] that
[2:26:21] 6586 comes from the root of
[2:26:26] 6585 is that right to stride from to
[2:26:31] walk away from
[2:26:34] willfully now the concept of sin in both
[2:26:39] Old and New Testament is something on
[2:26:42] the
[2:26:43] surface so we repent and it's wiped off
[2:26:48] the blood of the blood of the Lamb
[2:26:51] him that's why you still find scriptures
[2:26:54] referring to the covering of the blood
[2:26:57] the blood covers the blood covers aren't
[2:26:59] you glad because it's talking about this
[2:27:03] surface
[2:27:04] unbelief you put the blood on that and
[2:27:07] you wipe it clean and it is as though
[2:27:09] it's never been there again before and
[2:27:11] and it come and you do it again you miss
[2:27:13] the Mark again and you repent and it's
[2:27:16] it's covered it's wiped off it's surface
[2:27:20] but when we start looking at
[2:27:23] transgression it goes a little deeper
[2:27:25] than the than the skin it goes deep it
[2:27:28] begins to to affect us from the inside
[2:27:31] out because it's a willful
[2:27:37] decision you didn't plot in sin come on
[2:27:42] you start plotting and planning under
[2:27:47] transgression you may have missed the
[2:27:51] mark
[2:27:53] unwillfully in
[2:27:56] sin by the time you come to the
[2:27:59] transgression which is the deeper level
[2:28:02] of
[2:28:03] unbelief you're hardly even
[2:28:06] trying to hit the target you just walks
[2:28:10] over there like a a a a
[2:28:13] fool with hob nailed
[2:28:16] shoes and you just grab up the bow
[2:28:20] and you don't care whether you hit the
[2:28:22] target or not you're not interested in
[2:28:26] in in the end of the
[2:28:28] game You've Got Your Eye Off the
[2:28:31] prize and all you want to do is get your
[2:28:34] turn over with you understand the
[2:28:36] difference and so you just halfheartedly
[2:28:42] oh I've got to go to
[2:28:46] church on we're going to hear the same
[2:28:49] off
[2:28:50] bang
[2:28:52] hello I I I he he he called brother
[2:28:56] brandom's name 23 times and Jesus's name
[2:28:59] 10
[2:29:02] times you you you're caught
[2:29:06] up in things that don't really
[2:29:09] matter in the in the full concept of
[2:29:12] where we are in this late
[2:29:14] hour so you're barely even trying to hit
[2:29:17] the target you're just agitated and
[2:29:20] aggravated with yourself and with
[2:29:22] everybody around you you see your
[2:29:25] unbelief is no more surface it's no more
[2:29:27] just unbelief on the skin it's now
[2:29:30] gotten deeper into your inner being and
[2:29:34] you just quite frankly don't care
[2:29:38] anybody with me I'm going to step out of
[2:29:41] the pull pit to say this because it's a
[2:29:42] little a little
[2:29:45] slangy the world says things like this
[2:29:47] you just don't give a hoot I I know
[2:29:50] that's don't don't say that don't repeat
[2:29:52] that children don't say
[2:29:55] that but you just don't really care who
[2:30:00] thinks
[2:30:03] what what does it really matter you you
[2:30:06] even get under something where sometimes
[2:30:08] somebody will speak to you and you won't
[2:30:10] even speak
[2:30:11] back you're just so full of your
[2:30:17] unbelief you're not even pretending
[2:30:19] anymore you understand saying it gets
[2:30:21] deeper and it takes a deeper Deliverance
[2:30:24] I want you to know that every time
[2:30:26] unbelief is driven deeper into the inner
[2:30:28] part of who you are your deliverance is
[2:30:31] more difficult and your freedom is
[2:30:34] harder to
[2:30:36] achieve and sometimes the process gets
[2:30:39] longer because you are
[2:30:42] rewiring your
[2:30:44] brain you are rewiring your belief
[2:30:48] system right
[2:30:50] wow the things you used to worry and and
[2:30:55] fret and you were concerned about
[2:30:57] getting them right now you just don't
[2:31:00] care the unbelief has gone deeper into
[2:31:04] who you are and and so it's going to be
[2:31:06] a little bit more of a process to get
[2:31:09] you out and you don't mind people
[2:31:11] knowing I don't
[2:31:15] care you come to church and you you lay
[2:31:18] on the pew
[2:31:20] yeah or you lay over on your spouse
[2:31:23] there's a time to be
[2:31:25] cozy and this is not the house for
[2:31:28] coziness this is not your bedroom this
[2:31:32] is not your wreck
[2:31:34] Hall this is God's house where we come
[2:31:37] to be
[2:31:38] instructed we come to learn and we come
[2:31:40] to experience the almighty God I'm not
[2:31:45] angry I'm just laying it out very
[2:31:46] plainly so you won't have to leave with
[2:31:48] so many questions
[2:31:50] that transgression gets deep in there
[2:31:52] look look it says it says to stride away
[2:31:55] from walk away from willfully to break
[2:31:59] away from just
[2:32:02] Authority not just Authority just
[2:32:05] authority to trespass to apostasis to
[2:32:10] quarrel
[2:32:12] yeah by the time your spirit becomes
[2:32:17] quarrelsome your soul has already
[2:32:19] started
[2:32:20] winning mind will and emotion here we go
[2:32:24] unbelief has already started taking a
[2:32:26] hold and your decisions are no longer
[2:32:28] based on righteousness and Faith they
[2:32:31] now begin to be based on
[2:32:35] emotion and demonic
[2:32:37] influence anybody with
[2:32:40] me to to apostasy to quarrel you've got
[2:32:44] an argumentative
[2:32:46] spirit because unbelief has taken a hold
[2:32:49] there are people who are going to argue
[2:32:51] my granny used to say my mama used to
[2:32:53] say they would argue with a sign
[2:32:58] board they just live and breathe to be
[2:33:04] contrary just a moment I'm not getting
[2:33:06] enough help from you Amen brother that's
[2:33:10] nothing but the truth they live and
[2:33:14] breathe to be
[2:33:16] argumentative and it's a it's a fruit
[2:33:19] it's a fruit that your unbelief has
[2:33:21] moved from the surface level of sin down
[2:33:24] into that dimension of
[2:33:27] transgression and that's not something
[2:33:29] you'll W up here to the altar sachche up
[2:33:32] here to The Altar and and and and knock
[2:33:36] off you'll have to lay that out before
[2:33:39] the Lord you won't get in a good service
[2:33:42] and get just free from that you'll have
[2:33:44] to get up under this thing and start
[2:33:46] calling out to the Lord I want you to go
[2:33:48] down Beyond The Sur surf of of unbelief
[2:33:51] I want you to start digging around in
[2:33:53] here where transgression has started
[2:33:55] trying to take a
[2:33:57] [Music]
[2:33:58] hold transgression oh oh excuse me
[2:34:01] apostasis quarrel offend Rebel
[2:34:05] Revolt you're after the shock Factor you
[2:34:08] want to shock Somebody by your new
[2:34:11] decisions and new ideas
[2:34:14] transgression is a willful act of
[2:34:19] disobedience
[2:34:21] it's not just I happen to be in the
[2:34:24] wrong place at the wrong time and I did
[2:34:26] the wrong thing no no no no
[2:34:29] transgression is a willful act of
[2:34:31] Disobedience it's a transgress look at
[2:34:33] this it's a transgression done it's an
[2:34:35] act of sin it's an act of unbelief
[2:34:41] specifically to put your finger in God's
[2:34:45] nose and say I know
[2:34:47] better but I choose to do what I want to
[2:34:53] do somebody said that sounds like a
[2:34:55] teenager it does doesn't it and where
[2:34:58] did they learn that behavior come
[2:35:02] on brother because I get that sometime
[2:35:05] from
[2:35:06] [Music]
[2:35:07] parents I know what the word said I know
[2:35:09] what the message
[2:35:14] said come on and then we look at the
[2:35:17] word iniquity
[2:35:20] it's a it's the Hebrew word a
[2:35:23] Awan it means
[2:35:25] perverseness to bend are you still
[2:35:28] listening bless your heart you're
[2:35:31] faithful I hope that's some mighty good
[2:35:33] soup and sandwiches you you ladies have
[2:35:35] prepared for these people they're going
[2:35:36] to be
[2:35:38] famished it means to bend to twist to
[2:35:44] distort bowed down Twisted to be bent
[2:35:50] or crooked yeah to be rung out of
[2:35:55] course it's a masculine noun remember in
[2:35:58] Hebrew nouns are are masculine and
[2:36:02] feminine and they are spelled
[2:36:04] differently pronounced differently in
[2:36:06] fact they're entirely different
[2:36:08] words in Hebrew a table can be male or
[2:36:13] female in the language of Hebrew and so
[2:36:17] it's a masculine noun means meaning
[2:36:19] iniquity evil guilt and
[2:36:22] Punishment
[2:36:26] Injustice we go
[2:36:28] on
[2:36:30] Injustice
[2:36:32] unrighteousness it's a
[2:36:35] deviation from rectitude listen morally
[2:36:39] and and what is rectitude it's morally
[2:36:42] correct thinking or behavior when we
[2:36:45] start deviating from morally correct
[2:36:50] thinking or behavior we're no longer
[2:36:52] under the influence of unbelief sin on
[2:36:55] the surface level we're no longer under
[2:36:59] unbelief on the level of it being a
[2:37:02] transgression just a willful decision
[2:37:05] but when we start moving into that depth
[2:37:08] that unbelief takes such a hold of us
[2:37:11] that it becomes an iniquity that's when
[2:37:14] we start affecting generations to come
[2:37:20] you see your surface unbelief
[2:37:23] is the effect that it will have on
[2:37:27] someone else is minimal you know why
[2:37:29] because everyone is dealing with the
[2:37:31] same kind of
[2:37:33] struggle when you start choosing to
[2:37:36] yield and make decisions based on
[2:37:38] unbelief you start having influence over
[2:37:40] people when that thing moves into the
[2:37:43] level of an iniquity which is a
[2:37:45] generational sin you start affecting
[2:37:48] your physical form form your DNA starts
[2:37:52] responding to your
[2:37:54] iniquity I can show you that at some
[2:37:57] point and and and it
[2:38:01] passes through your DNA and
[2:38:05] RNA to your
[2:38:07] children and your grandchildren and your
[2:38:10] great-grandchildren we've Al often
[2:38:13] wondered Through The Years how that a
[2:38:15] man who struggles with alcohol will
[2:38:18] often see the next generation struggling
[2:38:20] struggling with alcohol and the Next
[2:38:22] Generation struggling with alcohol and
[2:38:25] in times past in years of not
[2:38:27] understanding we said well it was just
[2:38:29] coming under the influence we now know
[2:38:31] scientifically that that's not exactly
[2:38:34] the case that there is such a perversion
[2:38:37] that takes place that it affects our DNA
[2:38:41] and our
[2:38:43] RNA the chains of our DNA are affected
[2:38:47] in fact scientifically they they do
[2:38:50] exactly what the scripture says they
[2:38:53] twist they
[2:38:56] Bend they
[2:38:58] transform and instead of you passing
[2:39:01] down your original chain of DNA and RNA
[2:39:07] you're now passing down something a a
[2:39:11] chain uh of cells that has been affected
[2:39:15] come on and so your children come along
[2:39:19] and they have a a a
[2:39:23] predisposition an unusual
[2:39:27] makeup to fall into the same kind of
[2:39:32] rebellion that you fell
[2:39:35] into and I'm going to tell you something
[2:39:38] you're you're responsible you and I are
[2:39:42] responsible for what we are passing
[2:39:46] genetically to our children
[2:39:49] of a spiritual
[2:39:52] origin and there's only one thing that
[2:39:54] can cancel and correct that and thank
[2:39:57] you thank you Lord thank you Lord that
[2:40:00] you didn't leave us victims of our own
[2:40:02] stupidity and evil hearts and and our
[2:40:05] lives of wasted year oh thank you Lord
[2:40:09] that you made a
[2:40:11] way to heal and repair
[2:40:15] us and those that we have already
[2:40:18] affected
[2:40:20] by deep-seated and rooted
[2:40:23] iniquity Mo it's it's a deviation from
[2:40:26] rectitude which is morally cor correct
[2:40:28] thinking or behavior also want of
[2:40:30] rectitude in principle wickedness or any
[2:40:33] Act of
[2:40:34] Injustice this is one of the four main
[2:40:37] words indicating sin in the Old
[2:40:40] Testament the word that is used for
[2:40:42] iniquity it indicates a particularly
[2:40:44] evil sin since it is strong it strongly
[2:40:48] conveys the idea of twisting or
[2:40:52] perverting something
[2:40:56] deliberately the noun also carries the
[2:40:59] idea of guilt from conscience
[2:41:02] wrongdoing the perversion as he put up
[2:41:05] there just a moment ago the perversion
[2:41:07] can literally change the DNA RNA
[2:41:10] structure of the cells in our flesh body
[2:41:13] and greatly shift our mental beliefs or
[2:41:16] attitudes resulting in genetic Chang
[2:41:19] that are passed on from
[2:41:23] generation to
[2:41:25] generation you see if we struggle with
[2:41:29] our
[2:41:30] faith and in our mind we are looking for
[2:41:33] ways out come on and shortcuts
[2:41:39] around but for the sake of our our
[2:41:43] children we never speak them out loud
[2:41:47] unfortunately
[2:41:49] we affect them
[2:41:55] anyway so even though we don't express
[2:41:58] it in front of them we have already
[2:42:01] marked
[2:42:02] them and we have a
[2:42:05] responsibility to break that thing and
[2:42:08] did you know you can do it can I do it
[2:42:10] for myself absolutely by his blood by
[2:42:13] his word by his grace can I do it for my
[2:42:16] children
[2:42:17] absolutely and must do it because the
[2:42:21] buck stops here the responsibility
[2:42:24] starts here it's right here it stops
[2:42:27] here it starts here it's my
[2:42:29] responsibility because I'm the one that
[2:42:32] has caught this Revelation that I must
[2:42:35] become one with the
[2:42:38] word so anything that hinders me from
[2:42:41] becoming one with the word I've got to
[2:42:42] deal with that not only for myself I've
[2:42:46] got to set the record straight for my
[2:42:48] children
[2:42:51] and here's why it's so hard for
[2:42:52] sometimes for parents to do that because
[2:42:54] it's going to require you to sit them
[2:42:56] down and say I was
[2:43:01] wrong and we think that our children
[2:43:03] will forsake us if we admit to them that
[2:43:06] we were wrong let me tell you something
[2:43:08] they're more likely to appreciate your
[2:43:12] desire to take
[2:43:16] responsibility than to push it off on
[2:43:18] the church or to to blame your neighbor
[2:43:19] down the road come on are you following
[2:43:26] me these changes are passed from
[2:43:28] generation to generation oh my oh my
[2:43:31] it's
[2:43:33] late I I have time tomorrow I don't have
[2:43:36] to do it all this is the way things like
[2:43:39] high blood pressure alcoholism sexual
[2:43:43] perversions jealousy anger fear various
[2:43:47] other addictions and Tendencies toward
[2:43:50] the perverse are passed down from
[2:43:54] generation to
[2:43:59] generation because someone dealt with
[2:44:01] the surface
[2:44:03] unbelief and they may have taken the
[2:44:05] time to dig a little deeper into the
[2:44:07] into the willful act of a
[2:44:11] transgression but they let that Spirit
[2:44:13] of
[2:44:14] iniquity it's it's a mystery it's a
[2:44:17] mystery it's now time to understand the
[2:44:19] mystery of iniquity and to send it an
[2:44:22] answer it's an antichrist Spirit that's
[2:44:26] that's not only out to twist twist the
[2:44:28] truth it's out to twist
[2:44:31] us and it has to be dealt with and let
[2:44:33] me tell you something there's another
[2:44:35] mystery that can fix the mystery of
[2:44:38] iniquity amen it's the mystery of his
[2:44:41] righteousness oh yes that I can put
[2:44:45] on his righteousness
[2:44:49] I could never be righteous enough I
[2:44:51] could never be holy enough in my
[2:44:54] condition my Fallen state but he has
[2:44:56] given me a
[2:44:58] robe if I'm willing to repent if I'm
[2:45:02] willing to take the
[2:45:04] word over my
[2:45:06] feelings if I'm willing to live a
[2:45:08] separated life from the spirit of leod
[2:45:12] deia if I'm willing to apply myself to
[2:45:16] truth and become one with him he gives
[2:45:19] me his robe of righteousness and he not
[2:45:21] only gives to me and for me he gives it
[2:45:25] for me to pass down as a generational
[2:45:28] blessing to my children and to my
[2:45:31] grandchildren and to my
[2:45:32] great-grandchildren and it matters yes
[2:45:34] it matters what you believe it matters
[2:45:36] what you stand for it will affect the
[2:45:38] Next Generation it will affect the Next
[2:45:41] Generation it will affect the Next
[2:45:44] Generation because these things run in
[2:45:47] the DNA and RNA at at least four
[2:45:51] generations so your children your
[2:45:53] grandchildren your great-grandchildren
[2:45:55] your great great grandchildren
[2:45:58] racism greed and
[2:46:01] idolatry can also run as a spirit of
[2:46:06] iniquity in Family
[2:46:09] Lines this is not for you to leave here
[2:46:11] tonight blaming anyone for your
[2:46:14] condition no you've got a responsibility
[2:46:17] because the remedy is in your hands
[2:46:19] you know what the blood can do you know
[2:46:21] what the word can do you know what the
[2:46:23] name of Jesus can do but see this is the
[2:46:27] problem with our love in Matthew 24:12
[2:46:30] musicians are
[2:46:32] coming this is the problem with our love
[2:46:35] and because not because sin not because
[2:46:39] transgressions are everywhere willful
[2:46:41] sin but because
[2:46:44] iniquity
[2:46:46] generational deep seated
[2:46:49] unbelief with all of its attributes yes
[2:46:53] sir is present in our nation Even in our
[2:46:59] churches even in some of our families
[2:47:01] that are represented here tonight and
[2:47:03] because not because sin abounds not
[2:47:06] because transgressions abound stay with
[2:47:08] me but because iniquity abounds it has
[2:47:12] frozen our love for Christ I have
[2:47:16] somewhat ought against you Ephesian
[2:47:17] Church age now
[2:47:19] again it baffles my mind that's the
[2:47:21] first church age if the first church age
[2:47:23] struggled with cold love don't you think
[2:47:25] the last Church age is going to struggle
[2:47:28] with cold love and every age in between
[2:47:32] if one generation away from the Earthly
[2:47:34] Ministry of Jesus Christ suffered with
[2:47:36] their love turning into an ice cube
[2:47:39] don't you think we'll also have to deal
[2:47:41] because iniquity is abounding even more
[2:47:43] in our day than it did in the first
[2:47:46] church age under the messenger Paul are
[2:47:48] you still here
[2:47:50] and so this is part of the reason why
[2:47:52] we're leaving our first love is because
[2:47:55] we are not dealing with iniquity in our
[2:48:01] lives we're petting
[2:48:05] it and that word iniquity there in Greek
[2:48:08] is
[2:48:10] anomia and it means the state or
[2:48:13] condition of being disposed inclined to
[2:48:17] what is Lawless law lessness having a
[2:48:20] tendency or
[2:48:21] predisposition toward a particular
[2:48:26] Behavior or
[2:48:29] sin we hide our sin from our wives we
[2:48:36] hide our iniquity from our
[2:48:41] families and they hide it from us our
[2:48:46] children hide it from their parents come
[2:48:48] on
[2:48:51] a pornography addiction that is not
[2:48:53] dealt with in your
[2:48:57] life you don't ever have to share it
[2:48:59] with your children you don't ever have
[2:49:01] to tell them how to access it you don't
[2:49:03] ever how to teach them you don't have to
[2:49:05] teach them how to find it you don't ever
[2:49:07] have to tell them that you've looked at
[2:49:09] it or participated in it but if you
[2:49:12] didn't deal with it before you brought
[2:49:14] children into the
[2:49:17] Earth according ording to this
[2:49:19] scriptural concept and I believe
[2:49:21] it you have already affected
[2:49:26] them because you wouldn't deal with it
[2:49:28] when you had an opportunity to deal with
[2:49:30] uh alter call after alter call and
[2:49:33] opportunity after opportunity but you
[2:49:35] let shame keep you from dealing with
[2:49:38] well nobody knows it's a victimless sin
[2:49:41] it's only me that it
[2:49:44] affects and our children are in their
[2:49:47] bedrooms dealing with the same kind of
[2:49:52] spirit no wonder we don't love one
[2:49:54] another no wonder we don't love Jesus
[2:49:56] like we should because we come to church
[2:49:58] so wrapped up in
[2:50:01] guilt
[2:50:04] am right we're so guilty when we come
[2:50:07] you're not coming here to experience
[2:50:09] your guiltiness you're coming here to
[2:50:11] experience your
[2:50:13] forgiveness but we haven't dealt with
[2:50:15] this thing so not only our love toward
[2:50:18] one another's
[2:50:21] affected our love toward him is
[2:50:29] affected there's some other definitions
[2:50:31] of iniquity here we might be able to
[2:50:33] look at them at another
[2:50:36] time but David found the
[2:50:40] remedy in Psalm 51:10
[2:50:43] create in
[2:50:46] me oh God my my DNA my RNA the cells of
[2:50:50] my body have been affected by
[2:50:52] generational
[2:50:54] iniquity religious Spirits from my
[2:50:57] forefathers denominational Spirits from
[2:51:00] my
[2:51:01] forefathers or or whatever it
[2:51:03] is has affected me my my
[2:51:07] heart has been
[2:51:09] tainted and my spirit has been greatly
[2:51:14] affected and so I come to you David I
[2:51:18] come to you
[2:51:19] you my iniquity caused me to steal what
[2:51:24] wasn't
[2:51:25] mine my iniquity that hadn't been dealt
[2:51:28] with caused me to lust after something
[2:51:31] that wasn't mine and steal something
[2:51:33] that wasn't mine and kill somebody that
[2:51:36] was not mine to kill to cover up the
[2:51:39] fact that I had stolen something that
[2:51:41] wasn't mine because I lusted for
[2:51:44] something that wasn't mine you
[2:51:47] understand so he didn't come to the Lord
[2:51:50] and just say Lord I need a free pass I'm
[2:51:52] the
[2:51:52] king and I can't afford for anybody to
[2:51:55] know how rotten I've been are you
[2:51:56] listening
[2:51:59] yes he said create in
[2:52:02] me can I paraphrase this for you this
[2:52:06] isn't just scrub my heart this is more
[2:52:09] on the level of a heart
[2:52:12] transplant can you take my Twisted
[2:52:16] heart can you take my heart that is has
[2:52:18] become darkened and deformed because I
[2:52:21] have dealt with my Surface sin I have
[2:52:24] dealt with my willful transgression sin
[2:52:26] but I have allowed iniquity to pass from
[2:52:30] Generations before me upon me without
[2:52:32] dealing with it and now I have swn it
[2:52:35] into the Next Generation and already
[2:52:37] perhaps the Next Generation so Lord I
[2:52:40] don't just need you to scrub my heart
[2:52:42] for it to be dirty all over again I need
[2:52:44] a new
[2:52:46] heart and I don't need you to lift my
[2:52:50] spirit but I need a totally
[2:52:54] right
[2:52:56] upright Spirit placed in
[2:53:02] me the prophet tells
[2:53:05] us that not only are there generational
[2:53:09] sins that pass like this iniquities into
[2:53:12] families that have to be dealt with
[2:53:14] spiritually he tells us that there are
[2:53:17] also generational blessings and
[2:53:20] gifts so once we deal with the ugly we
[2:53:24] can start calling
[2:53:26] forth the
[2:53:28] blessings do you understand and let me
[2:53:31] share this in
[2:53:36] closing in the message God commissioning
[2:53:38] Moses Jonesboro
[2:53:40] Arkansas brother brandham said I heard a
[2:53:42] fellow say the other day that sickness
[2:53:45] the Lord did sickness put sickness on
[2:53:47] you that might that might be so if
[2:53:50] you're
[2:53:51] sinning You' done something wrong make
[2:53:53] it right with God that's right that's
[2:53:55] true but sickness is of the devil so
[2:53:58] just remember folks sickness is not of
[2:54:00] God sickness is of the devil if God
[2:54:03] allows it to come it's still not of God
[2:54:07] it's of the devil and sickness is an
[2:54:11] attribute of
[2:54:13] unbelief now what we find in looking at
[2:54:16] these words is this it's more or less an
[2:54:19] attribute of iniquity and not just
[2:54:21] surface sin and not the occasional
[2:54:24] willful sin but it's more likely the
[2:54:27] result of that deep seated iniquity that
[2:54:30] runs in the family that we haven't
[2:54:32] completely dealt with it's but he says
[2:54:36] listen because of sin we had sickness
[2:54:38] not because maybe you sinned but it's
[2:54:40] something to come down through the
[2:54:44] generations he visited even to the
[2:54:51] but but I don't mind you saying
[2:54:55] but but the blood of Jesus
[2:55:00] Christ taken away
[2:55:03] sin and it taken
[2:55:06] away somebody said isn't that the wrong
[2:55:08] case for that word taken no it's
[2:55:13] done it it's finished so you hear this
[2:55:16] hillbilly English and you'll know it's
[2:55:18] already
[2:55:21] took he said if you David's are ready to
[2:55:24] claim your place yes sir and he said you
[2:55:28] mean to tell me that you'll let that
[2:55:30] Philistine stand out there and defy the
[2:55:32] armies of the Living God see he starts
[2:55:35] dealing with the lack of Courage and the
[2:55:38] lack of faith that has probably fallen
[2:55:41] on us because we didn't deal with the
[2:55:44] iniquity
[2:55:48] can I give you one
[2:55:53] more just the very next one uh uh hear
[2:55:56] you him and we and we're
[2:55:58] done I I'm sorry I am I really am
[2:56:04] sorry he said and now if you're dealing
[2:56:07] with
[2:56:08] sin now maybe you never sined but there
[2:56:11] might be a sin that your father did your
[2:56:13] grandfather did he said he'd visit the
[2:56:17] iniquity of the parent
[2:56:19] upon the third and fourth
[2:56:22] generation and each generation gets
[2:56:26] weaker and wiser as the Bible said but
[2:56:31] it's all started from sin before sin
[2:56:34] came into the world there was no
[2:56:35] sickness in the world and sickness came
[2:56:37] through the fall and the fall was sin
[2:56:39] and the
[2:56:40] sin is unbelief he that believeth not is
[2:56:44] condemned already before you even get
[2:56:46] started you're condemned you're born in
[2:56:48] sin shaped in
[2:56:53] iniquity
[2:56:55] molded and you're already molded by
[2:56:59] iniquity come to the
[2:57:03] world speaking lies you don't want to
[2:57:06] say it out loud but it's a truth isn't
[2:57:07] it we know that about that old nature no
[2:57:11] matter how much you was dedicated on the
[2:57:13] altar how many times you were sprinkled
[2:57:15] baptized poured whatever it is you're
[2:57:17] still a sinner that's all until you
[2:57:20] repent and God recognizes and seals that
[2:57:23] promise with the
[2:57:26] Holy how important is the holy spirit it
[2:57:30] finishes the new birth we've got to have
[2:57:33] it we've got to have him we've got to
[2:57:34] have the Holy Ghost we've got to have
[2:57:36] him in our life we can't hope we do or
[2:57:38] think we do we've got to have the Holy
[2:57:40] Ghost we've got to have our own
[2:57:42] encounter with God we've got to meet the
[2:57:44] pillar of fire for ourselves we've got
[2:57:46] to be filled with the Holy Ghost and
[2:57:49] Fire Mama's experience is not enough
[2:57:52] Daddy's experience is not
[2:57:55] enough we've got to have it he said
[2:57:58] that's right then you're born again then
[2:58:00] you're son and daughter of God it's a
[2:58:02] regeneration a new creation then your
[2:58:05] attributes your thoughts are not like
[2:58:07] they were your life is not like it was
[2:58:09] you become a complete surrendered vessel
[2:58:12] to God and he speaks and uses you and
[2:58:14] you're not your own no more
[2:58:18] right but you're bought with a
[2:58:21] price that's the price of the Precious
[2:58:24] Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ think of
[2:58:28] it let's stand let's
[2:58:31] stretch I I I I I intended to do
[2:58:37] better it's a big
[2:58:41] subject you must not leave here heavy
[2:58:45] you must not leave here under uh uh some
[2:58:49] sort of guilt or condemnation you must
[2:58:54] understand that if we can deal with that
[2:58:57] iniquity our love can be
[2:59:02] unfrozen we can burn with love for Jesus
[2:59:06] Christ like we did when we first gave
[2:59:09] him our heart and we can burn with love
[2:59:13] for one another preferring one another
[2:59:17] fighting in the Spirit of prayer for one
[2:59:20] another praying that each and every one
[2:59:23] of us can overcome not Desiring that any
[2:59:27] should get what they deserve but
[2:59:29] believing that every one of us will come
[2:59:33] to the full maturity of this word this
[2:59:36] is our heart's desire this is what we
[2:59:38] believe so Lord we raise our hands to
[2:59:41] you as Benjamin prepares to come and
[2:59:43] lead us in a moment of worship we lift
[2:59:46] our hands to you and we thank thank you
[2:59:48] from the start we thank you for the
[2:59:50] blood of the Lamb we thank you that it
[2:59:52] was not the blood of a Jew or a gentile
[2:59:55] it was not the blood of a man or a woman
[2:59:58] it was not a human blood that has
[3:00:00] redeemed us but it was God's own blood
[3:00:03] blood specifically created for the power
[3:00:07] of redemption to buy us back to bring us
[3:00:10] back to your original thoughts about us
[3:00:13] if we in any way have been slacked in
[3:00:16] dealing with sin transgression or or
[3:00:19] iniquity we come before you believing
[3:00:22] that your blood is
[3:00:25] sufficient we repent right now for
[3:00:28] allowing our own guilt and our own Pride
[3:00:34] to keep us from laying these things on
[3:00:36] the altar we repent that it has affected
[3:00:40] our children and our grandchildren we re
[3:00:43] we repent that we haven't taken the
[3:00:46] bloody way for them but tonight as we
[3:00:49] grow in our understanding of why our
[3:00:52] love gets cold it doesn't seem like this
[3:00:55] would be an hour that the bride's love
[3:00:58] would be affected but that iniquity that
[3:01:01] Lies Beneath the surface that must be
[3:01:04] dealt with By The Sword of the word of
[3:01:08] God not covered by the blood but dug up
[3:01:12] by the blood it is not a covering that
[3:01:16] we seek but a mission that so
[3:01:20] removes this iniquity from our lives
[3:01:24] that our physical body is remade and
[3:01:28] reshaped what was once shaped by
[3:01:32] iniquity oh Jesus may we now be shaped
[3:01:38] and molded by your
[3:01:41] righteousness instead of passing down a
[3:01:46] predisposition for addiction and lust to
[3:01:49] our children Lord may we now begin to
[3:01:53] pass on to our children and Grand
[3:01:55] children a hunger and a desire for your
[3:02:01] righteousness may we be so burn burning
[3:02:06] with
[3:02:08] love
[3:02:09] consumed by your
[3:02:12] love until all of the chaff is destroyed
[3:02:16] in the fury of the flame
[3:02:18] and only your
[3:02:20] life Rises Up From the
[3:02:23] Ashes and brings us into transformation
[3:02:26] and
[3:02:27] Transfiguration from a body of Fallen
[3:02:30] humanity and flesh to to a new
[3:02:33] existence your word promised that we are
[3:02:35] New Creations we're not of the old old
[3:02:39] things have passed away behold all
[3:02:41] things have become new oh God if there
[3:02:45] are those among us today who still
[3:02:47] dabble in in these things we throw no
[3:02:49] Stones we have no reason to condemn
[3:02:53] anyone for we have all struggled in one
[3:02:56] way or another but we pray tonight that
[3:02:59] they will rise like the prodigal from
[3:03:01] the pig pin we pray tonight that they
[3:03:04] will shake themselves and realize that
[3:03:06] the spirit of the Lord has withdrawn
[3:03:08] from their lives that they will
[3:03:10] recognize that the anointing is no
[3:03:12] longer present and all they have to do
[3:03:15] is come running back to Papa's house
[3:03:19] house pray
[3:03:21] Saints don't just listen to my prayer
[3:03:24] pray with me would
[3:03:26] you may they came come running back to
[3:03:30] Papa's
[3:03:37] arms carrying a load on their
[3:03:41] back that they can slip off their
[3:03:46] shoulder on to The
[3:03:49] Altar and you will bear
[3:03:54] it I cry out Lord for my
[3:03:58] children for my
[3:04:03] grandchildren if you T and even if I go
[3:04:06] by the way of the Grave if you T my
[3:04:09] great
[3:04:15] grandchildren may I find grave
[3:04:18] to deal with every
[3:04:22] demon every warping
[3:04:26] Spirit may I find no consolation in
[3:04:29] blaming my
[3:04:32] parents may I have no desire to shift
[3:04:35] the blame off on a generation past may I
[3:04:38] own
[3:04:39] it if I nursed it if I held on to it if
[3:04:42] I kept it Lord it was
[3:04:46] me and I repent before you this
[3:04:49] evening and I'm asking you to send the
[3:04:52] sword of your word to the root of
[3:04:54] anything in
[3:04:56] me that that closes you out of any
[3:04:59] portion of my
[3:05:01] life if there's anything in me that is
[3:05:03] not of you Lord I want it ripped
[3:05:06] out and I bring it to you
[3:05:13] tonight we don't want to just see the
[3:05:15] surface sin scrub
[3:05:18] off or the transgression that lays
[3:05:21] beneath the surface finished so that we
[3:05:24] no longer choose to willfully
[3:05:26] sin but we want anything that has formed
[3:05:29] us and shaped
[3:05:32] us any iniquity that
[3:05:35] has affected

[3:37:04] moment I'm here for
[3:37:07] Logistics and I may be somewhat of a
[3:37:10] dictator doing
[3:37:11] it but we have a lot of mud down down at
[3:37:15] the fellowship hall so there is going to
[3:37:19] be very limited Vehicles going down
[3:37:22] there
[3:37:23] tonight Joshua Yantis has the golf cart
[3:37:27] if you want to ride down on the golf
[3:37:29] cart he's available to take you down on
[3:37:31] the golf cart I have asked brother Hawke
[3:37:35] because his van is lower to the ground
[3:37:38] any of you seniors that want to ride the
[3:37:40] van down to the bottom brother Hawke
[3:37:43] will help to get you down there in the
[3:37:45] van
[3:37:45] it's easier to get in and out of other
[3:37:48] than that we need to keep the traffic to
[3:37:51] the bottom there's not room but to park
[3:37:53] about six cars down there so I've asked
[3:37:56] Ben Ellsworth to direct traffic and so
[3:38:00] we're going to take as few cars down
[3:38:02] tonight because again there is a lot of
[3:38:05] mud it rained last night and we don't
[3:38:07] want anybody stuck we don't want you
[3:38:10] walking in the mud tracking it in the
[3:38:12] building and we don't want you to track
[3:38:14] it back up on to the asphalt so if you
[3:38:17] will either walk down or ride the golf
[3:38:21] cart or ride in brother Hawk's van of
[3:38:24] course brother shelle have already asked
[3:38:25] Benjamin to take you down in your own
[3:38:27] vehicle right park right there in front
[3:38:29] of the vehicle or in front of the
[3:38:31] Tabernacle but we want to keep the the
[3:38:33] vehicles to a minimum tonight please
[3:38:36] make sure if they need assistance
[3:38:38] getting that they do don't don't oh yeah
[3:38:39] yeah make sure that yeah don't strug
[3:38:42] remember it won't always be this way we

[3:38:47] get you down there so you don't have to
[3:38:49] walk you you can wait your turn all
[3:38:53] right
[3:38:55] so what's
[3:38:58] that yes the The Far Side is the side
[3:39:02] that you need to walk down so everybody
[3:39:05] be real mindful of those that are
[3:39:07] walking there are lights on the front of
[3:39:09] the building now so hopefully it will
[3:39:12] illuminate plenty till that everybody

[3:39:19] going to be cold when you first walk
