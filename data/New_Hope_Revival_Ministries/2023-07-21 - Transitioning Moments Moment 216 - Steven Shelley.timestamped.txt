[0:06] because there's one thing you need to
[0:08] know if there's anything that you need
[0:10] to know and you don't know you will know
[0:13] because you're his
[0:15] if there's anything that has to be made
[0:17] real to you and it hasn't been made real
[0:19] to you yet hold on because if you're
[0:23] part of that elected bride there'll be
[0:25] no Rapture without you
[0:28] [Applause]
[0:31] because you become one with that word
[0:34] and the same holy ghost that helps you
[0:36] helps your neighbor there will help you
[0:38] if you keep your eyes on the Sun
[0:40] remember we preached last Sunday don't
[0:42] look at the church don't look at any
[0:43] church don't look at other message
[0:45] churches don't look at your church
[0:49] because there's flesh in all of them
[0:54] there's mistakes in all of them yes
[1:01] you get your eyes on people
[1:05] you won't feel you won't see that
[1:07] manifestation of the truth in you but
[1:09] you get your eyes on the son
[1:11] no matter what the storm is doing you
[1:13] hear the song doesn't matter what the
[1:15] storm is doing around you you get your
[1:17] eyes on Jesus
[1:18] get your eyes on Jesus someone said I
[1:21] can't figure all this out I don't know
[1:22] how to put all these things you're
[1:23] talking about terms that I don't know
[1:25] anything about well just stick around
[1:27] don't be scared off
[1:30] pick around because we have a
[1:32] determination to keep our eyes on Jesus
[1:34] and if we do he'll lead us all the way
[1:39] you see there's got to be a people who
[1:41] recognize when the pillar of fire moves
[1:46] that they don't just keep driving their
[1:49] state down
[1:50] but they keep following that Pillar of
[1:53] Fire
[1:54] because he'll not lead you off the word
[1:57] he leads you always back to the word
[2:00] we've got to have the Holy Ghost we've
[2:03] got to have the Holy Ghost I didn't say
[2:06] we've got to speak in tongues I said
[2:07] we've got to have the Holy Ghost
[2:11] because he changes everything
[2:14] amen he tuned you up so that you can
[2:17] hear the voice of God and keep moving
[2:19] forward there is a crescendo that is
[2:22] taking place there is a consummation
[2:24] that is taking place and everything is
[2:27] gathering together in one moment we
[2:29] could even say that we're in a place
[2:31] like that as the little bride of Jesus
[2:33] Christ right now we're living in a world
[2:36] that's about to implode
[2:39] so the bride is at a very pivotal and
[2:42] important position in this hour
[2:45] and we're going to have to be very
[2:47] careful how we walk out the Future Days
[2:49] of our life we're going to understand
[2:51] that what we have gotten by with in the
[2:54] past we may not get by with in this hour
[2:57] a compromise that we have picked up
[2:59] along the way that God has allowed us
[3:01] just to go on we may not be able to
[3:04] compromise the same way in this hour
[3:07] we may have to come back to what the
[3:09] prophet said he said you have gone as
[3:12] far with God as you're ever going to go
[3:14] until you're willing to pay a greater
[3:16] price and we might have to say Lord I
[3:19] want every bit of compromise out of my
[3:21] life
[3:23] I want everything out of my life that
[3:25] that is hindering me from the fullness
[3:28] of what your promise is to my life
[3:30] I think we may be in one of those
[3:33] transitioning moments
