TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] you [Music] you [Music] hello I'm Pastor Steven Shelly and you're watching the Eagles cry I want to welcome you to the program today we are in the middle of a series where we are studying the scriptures and looking at them together the scriptures concerning spiritual adoption and we sometimes refer to it as the process of spiritual adoption maybe you're more familiar with the pronunciation of the word process but we're looking at the fact that there is a beginning point and there is a growth a process whereby we come into a deeper place of maturity in the Lord Jesus Christ we see that in the life of the Lord Jesus Yeshua the Messiah and we're going to look at that today on the last program we were reading all of the Gospel accounts concerning the baptism and on the Mount of Transfiguration so we'll do a recap in just a moment and then we'll continue the teaching I hope you're not boring with the subject because this is one of the most important subjects that I believe God is speaking to his people about in this hour and there is something about it that stirs me so much I get so excited when I talk about this process of spiritual adoption and coming into that place of maturity in Jesus Christ we're tired of being children we're tired of being tossed to and fro with every wind that blows by we want to be mature and we want to be people that are not driven by our emotions but people who are anchored in the Word of God and we meet the resistance of the enemy not emotionally but we meet the resistance of the enemy a standing firm on the revelation that he has given us from his word so that's what this study is about I want to thank you for those of you who have emailed us or sent even a letter or a phone call to let us know that the Eagles cry is a blessing to you it's a wonderful blessing when we hear from you it thrills us in fact and still to this day I go home and tell my children that we have heard from India from Pakistan from united arab emirates and all over Europe and Scandinavia and the UK and and the list goes on and on and it's just such a privilege to be able to come to you and that's why I appreciate so much the sacrifice that's being made on on the Christian networks that bring you the Eagles cry so when you pray pray for them that God will bless them and use them and increase them as they continue to labor tirelessly to get the gospel around the world I want us to look right into the scriptures today and continue our study okay when we were together last time we read from Matthew Mark and Luke that would be Matthew chapter three mark chapter one and Luke chapter three concerning the baptism of the Lord Jesus now I don't want to take your time to to go back and read all of the verses but I want to recap by saying that in Matthew when the Lord is being brought up out of the water the Spirit of God descended like a dove and a voice spoken said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased in mark he records that the voice said thou art my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased slightly different wording but certainly the same message and then in Luke it is recorded thou art my beloved Son in thee I am well pleased so the addition of one word v I think it's clear for us to understand that there is a tremendous continuity and harmony between all three of the Gospel writers concerning the voice and what the voice said I believe that perhaps a more accurate translation of these words would be thou art my beloved son or you are my beloved Son in whom I am pleased to dwell you do understand that it was the eternal spirit of the father that was embodied incarnate in the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah so what was this announcement about it seeing that it was an announcement of relationship where the Spirit of God the Eternal Spirit of the father was testifying to those that day on the banks of the Jordan River this is my son this is the promised messiah and i am pleased to dwell in him later we find Jesus saying in the Gospels that when you've seen me you've seen the father we also hear him saying that he can do nothing unless it is revealed to him by his father so we know that there was an almost almost incomprehensible unity it's very difficult it's only by the revelation of the Holy Spirit that we can understand the the unique the unique characteristics of Yeshua the Messiah he was both God and man the eternal spirit of the father lived inside of him and yet he had a fleshly body that got hungry that got tired that got upset and angry in fact the scripture said he was in all manner tempted as we are that that's that brings hope to me to know and yet the scripture says without sin jesus said I have overcome the world he said little children I write unto you that you should overcome the world and he said you can because I have that's even more hope so we have a tremendous amount of hope in the Lord Jesus Christ in that he was able to please the father though he was living in a fleshly body now in Matthew Mark and Luke we have the account of what happened on the Mount of Transfiguration we mentioned the last time we were together that that historically some believe that it happened on Mount Tabor and some believe that it happened on Mount her moan I'm not one hundred percent clear but I believe that because mount hormone is in the general area of Caesarea Philippi and that is where Yeshua was with his disciples just prior to what happened on the Mount of Transfiguration that it's more likely that this high mountain was in fact mount her moon there are other other reasons why one would come to that conclusion as well that perhaps we can talk about at another time some indication of that could perhaps be in studying the events that took place in Genesis chapter 6 but we'll have to save that of course for another study in Matthew chapter 17 now I'm not going to read the whole account again we did that but we read that there was a bright cloud that overshadowed them remember Moses and Elijah appeared with the Lord Jesus Yeshua talking to him and he had taken with him his inner circle of trusted friends the disciples a Peter James and John and so the cloud came and overshadowed them and there was a voice that spoke out of the cloud much like happened in the Jordan River during the time of the baptism and this time Matthew said the voice said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased almost identical but with the addition of three words hear ye him it appears that the announcement was taken to a deeper level mark said this is my beloved son hear him and that was mark chapter 9 and in Luke chapter 9 we have the voice saying from the cloud this is my beloved son hear him it appears that the father was announcing to Peter James and John that it was now time that that our Lord Jesus had come to the fullness of hizmet dirty and that he would now be launched with a very important message that would transform lives somebody said wait a minute that sounds quite strange that Jesus had a process of adoption to go through but remember the scriptures that we've looked at more than once here on the Eagles cry in Hebrews chapter 5 verses 8 through 10 I particularly love these verses though he were a son now for me that is not debatable that is a fact Jesus Christ Yeshua HaMashiach was the son of the Living God for me that's a revelation though he were a son yet learned he obedience now perhaps you think well because he was the son of God he had need to learn nothing but that is not in fact what the scripture teaches yet learned he obedience how how did he learn total obedience and surrender to the will of his father the scripture said by the things which he suffered his suffering caused him to be able to come to that place of total surrender and oneness and submission and obedience to his Heavenly Father I believe as I have indicated on this program before that God is about to bring forth a company of believers who will operate in the same kind of oneness that Jesus had with the father that you and I will come to a place of spiritual maturity that we will operate and demonstrate our oneness Union and relationship with God when that comes to its fullness or into its a stage of maturity the world is going to see a demonstration of the power of God that is unprecedented in human history because it's not going to be one Jesus it's not going to be a handful of a posse it's not going to be a couple three four thousand people as it was in the early church or a few tokens here and there as it was in the great healing revival of the 50s and 60s but a whole company of believers that are individually yet simultaneously being prepared and equipped all over the world right now and how is that happening I mean how do people know that they're being prepared and equipped for this place of sonship they know it because the deep of God in their spirit is calling out to the deep I remember a story one time that we were told about a child I've mentioned it here on the program before but it seems to fit where we're speaking about right now there was a child many years ago who began to demonstrate unusual behavior by eating the erasers off of the pencils in school and then they found the same child literally eating the pedals the rubber petals of the bicycle and they took the child to the doctor because they thought this is the most unusual behavior we've ever seen something must be terribly wrong and they take the child to the physician and the physician examines the child and does tests and finds out that the only thing wrong with this child is that the child has a deficiency of of something like sulfur and without any knowledge without anyone telling the child that there is sulfur in rubber something caused the child may be putting a pencil in his mouth one day and you know just chewing on it or sucking on it like children have a tendency to do somehow the sulfur that was in the rubber of that eraser met a need in that child's body that kept that child going back time and time again to chew the erasers off and to eat the pedals off of the bicycle when I hear that stole it's it's like there was a deep need a deficiency something lacking in that child's body in the systems of that child's body that they weren't getting the child wasn't getting the need met by the food that he was eating or his regular vitamins or whatever the child might have been taking the only thing that satisfied the need he found it almost accidentally but quite profoundly in the eraser or the rubber pedal on a bicycle I believe that right now all over the world there is a deep need that is gnawing and pulling in the spirit man of those that God is choosing to be overcomers in the last day what we call a part of the Bride of Christ and there's a yearning and a burning and a longing for more of God and you perhaps don't even know why do I feel this way am i weird am i strange do I need the doctor is there something wrong with me because you've just got this longing and burning and I believe what it is it's the deep of God that's calling out it's a deep within you a deep desire a deep need calling out and and the deep is calling to the deep and if the deep is calling to the deep there must be somewhere something that will respond that will satisfy that need now a lot of times people are looking for things of this world and alternative religions and and and so forth to fulfill that need but that will never satisfy the true longing of the sons of God for union with God it is something that's happening and I traveled all over the world I've been in over 60 nations and everywhere I've been I meet people that have this unexplainable almost longing and desire for more of God Church is good being together with God's people is good reading good books about what God has done is good but none of that satisfies enough so you keep coming back to God and coming back to God and coming back to God and I believe there's an important lesson that we're learning in this hour so I just encourage you to search the Scriptures diligently to confirm that these things be so to pray and pour out your heart before the Lord confess your need to God and know that he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins to meet us at the point of our need there's nothing that you have need of in God that that he doesn't have in his bountiful resource supply if you'll just trust him and apply the word of God to your life you know it's the enemy's job to try to disconnect you from the Word of God to disqualify you to cause you to feel like well that's good for for goody-goodies but i'm not a goody-goody now that's good for this group of people or for those who were raised in the church sometimes people say churches all right for women and children you know you'll sometimes hear macho men say churches all right for old ladies and children well I want to tell you something it's not just old ladies and children that need a Savior every person under the sound of my voice needs a savior you need the Lord and many of you have found him but you have also found yourself walking in a place of lethargy a place of you know spiritual laziness and God wants to stir that up and that's part of the reason why we're bringing the kind of teachings that we bring on the Eagles cry it just it's just sort of the vein or the flow that God has called us to it's sort of the mandate that we have and we're just putting nuggets we're just trying to put little deposits of something before you that perhaps will stir something up it will touch that part of your destiny and will cause you to to maybe give God a little more attention and spend a little more time just being quiet before the Lord and as I've taught you many times on this program the the number one way to approach God I think and you know you might theological II disagree but I think even more than prayer I think praise and worship is one of the greatest avenues that we have as believers to touch the heart of God when we just start loving on the Lord Lord I love you I thank you for what you've done in my life and I thank you for who you are I have friends that spend an enormous amount of time reading the Psalms to God reading them out loud as a form of worship and praise developing a biblical praise and worship vocabulary that touches the heart of God and it and it makes a connection it deepens and strengthens the spiritual connection that we have with the Lord and causes us to to grow to grow in grace to grow in truth to grow in supernatural knowledge and wisdom and the things that have been promised to us as part of our relationship with the Lord so though he were a son yet learn to obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey Him called of God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek now quickly let's look at the word sons because we get this as many times in the scripture sons and there are actually three different Greek words that can be translated as sons or children in the Bible and what I have found by looking at those three words is that they reveal a pattern of sort of like three stages or three steps toward maturity in the life of a believer and that sort of typed out in the natural development of a child of a person of a human being now we look at the three words and the first word is technion and it means infancy so sometimes you're reading and it will say sons or children and that Greek word there will be technion and it means infancy it means just born newborn or in toddler stage we might would refer to it in the United States technion te kan io n and then the second word is technol without the AI te KN 0 N and that generally refers to a stage of development in the human life that we would call puberty or adolescence this is in the beginning of the teenage years those years that are extremely difficult in in reality in in real life there are many physical changes and hormonal changes and emotional changes that kick in and start taking place in in a child when they reach that age of puberty or adolescents or in Greek technol but now that word technol is often translated sons and so you need to kind of be able to look at it and see if the scripture says sons is it talking about infant is it talking about puberty or adolescents or is it talking about the third word that is often used for children or sons from the Greek and it's Hugh's H you I OS and it means maturity now we talked about that already when we were looking at our very first program together we looked at that word Hughes and thesis and when you put those words together you get the definition is placing of a mature son and that word is translated from the Greek into as adoption and it's made up of hue switches maturity and thesis which is the placing or the positioning of a mature son so we've got infancy and that's the the Gaga googoo cooing stage of life the scooting stage the crawling around stage and then you've got the that the Technion the the technol the puberty the adolescence the teenage years and then you've got the heels which is the mature the adult and now you know I have to be honest and say you can be an adult in years and not an adult in maturity you can be a teenager in years and be quite mature for your age and in the natural we're talking about and I think it's also this way in the spiritual now these three words reveal to us three stages in normal life development but we're going to put them into the realm of the Spirit and we're going to look at Jesus Yeshua the Messiah he was a covenant man he was a man of the Covenant he was of course the Son of God the Eternal Spirit of the Father incarnate he condescended he came down walked among men and he became he became what we are so that we can become what he is by faith that's the greatest love story that I know of I don't know of a greater love story than that the sacrifice that Jesus made laid aside his splendor and came as a baby and lived and suffered and died and rose again shed his blood paid the price so that I might come to that place of relationship that he had with the father so that he could say when you've seen me you've seen the father I and my father are one he said you and I / will not enjoy that relationship in exactly the same manner as the Lord Jesus who was deity in flesh but we will in a very specific and special way chosen by God we will enjoy that union and that special place and and just how big it is and to what degree it is is somewhat debatable I think it would be a shock to you if you would do the study yourself I think you would find out and you know people sometimes have a problem when you talk about deity and because they don't fully understand what it means to have the Spirit of God living inside of them now I'm a man and I sin and I make mistakes and I have to come to God on a daily basis I'm honest I come to God on a daily basis and although I may not be actively engaged in in committing rebellious acts of sin or or you know what we would think of as wickedness or ungodliness but I constantly have to come to god about my thoughts I have to come to god about feeling critical or are judgmental and so daily we come and we lay our need before the Lord and we tell him and he works on that and he he brings situations into our life to sort of tunis up and to tweak us as a word that we use that that helps us to come into his image ultimately so that we can be active participators in the harvest there's a harvest coming and we are called of God to actively participate with heaven in that final harvest of souls where did my time go I'll never know but we need to praise before we go off the air father I thank you for this day and I thank you for your word it is light it is life it is strength and it brings joy to the inner man it heals our spirit and lord I ask that you would would stir up the hunger that there would be a deep calling in every person who's watching this program right now and that you owe faithful God would respond to that deep calling by releasing the deep truths and mysteries of your kingdom to those who seek for them in the wonderful name of Jesus Yeshua the Messiah we pray amen any man thank you for watching the Eagles cry tune in again next week bye bye for now [Music] you [Music] you [Music]
