Description:
We are not ignorant of our enemy’s devices. Why? Because we know his patterns, we can see where he’s been and we have to stop him at the pass so we don’t fall into unbelief. We must keep watch over our own lives because anything that we carry that hinders us from being all that God has called us to be is a lie and can only be met with the fire, life and truth of the Holy Ghost.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
if we are without knowledge and understanding of the enemy's devices he will take the advantage of us the only thing the enemy can do or use against you is to find something that will strike your mind if you know it's him if you know it's the devil and you know that's the venue that he uses to attack you in this hour and you know that thought it's nothing in the world but a missile from Satan's attempt to dissuade you and you know that if you know it if you're aware of it in that moment and you don't immediately do something to stop him at the pass it's not just carelessness it's not just being too busy with life stresses its unbelief are you trying to make us feel bad this morning for every time that Satan has got an advantage over us not at all no one could feel any worse than I do for all the times that he has taken advantage of me while I stood back and knew what to do but failed to do it so we share in the misery this morning but here's what we have to say about everything that troubles us that was then that was then this is now we got to be Watchmen this morning we've got to watch in every area of our lives and we've got to be ahead one step ahead and the only way you could be one step ahead of the enemy is watch where he's been remember what he has said know his patterns I tell you you've got the advantage over your enemy when you know his pattern so in other words we not only have to recognize what the enemy is doing and the lie that he's trying to tell we have to examine our hearts this morning and find the stronghold because it's those strongholds that have not yet been cut down to to the root and the root dug out we've got to dig every bit of that foundation up so that when the enemy launches that arrow against us the next time there's nothing there for him to build on there's nothing in us that is attracted to any part of Satan's lie and because we are not ignorant of his devices anything anything any personality traits anything you carry that hinders you from being all that God has called you to be is a lie and it is not of God and it is not who you really are so don't you use some of these things and say well God made me that way that's a lie and it's so much lie that you cannot engage that lie any longer because when the Holy Ghost comes in to live you now have fire and life and truth living inside of you that can transform recreate you back to the image of everything that God intended to do for you and through you in the beginning and he's waiting on somebody to be an instrument to be a gate to be a door so that he can step through he lives right here he just steps right through you into the earth he did it through a POW he did it through a Peter neither of which were flawless [Music]
