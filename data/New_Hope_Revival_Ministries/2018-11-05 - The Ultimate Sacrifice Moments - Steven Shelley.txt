TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and here's the bigger question can you identify your life your circumstances your sin your condition where you are now can you look to that cross and identify that Jesus Christ has made the ultimate sacrifice for your sins and if you are willing to confess your sin if you're willing to repent of your sin then you have every right to the redemptive work that he accomplished on your behalf on that cross his sacrifice is yours his offering is yours the price he paid is your price and by that and because of that we can have eternal life I realize there are people who go years in church who attend church for years and they never come to that place where they can fully identify that the work that was accomplished on that cross was for me if I would have been the only one he would have done that just for me
