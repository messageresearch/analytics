TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit [Music] but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer [Music] is surrendering our mind to the word that's what makes the big difference that's the great mystery right twiced in you the hope award [Music] hello I'm pastor Stephen Shelley and I want to welcome you to the broadcast today we're coming together in partnership with our ministry new hope revival ministries and the gospel channel we are just tremendously blessed to have another opportunity to come and share the good news and the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ before we get into the program today our format is going to be a little bit different because I once again have the privilege of introducing to you a great friend of our ministry someone that many of you are going to recognize and that is evangelist Gerald Hicks he shared a couple months back now his testimony and we had tremendous response people reaching out for prayer and people saying what a blessing his testimony was what an encouragement it was to them and in just a few minutes we're going to turn him loose and let him share whatever the Lord has placed on his heart for you and I today he ministered in our church last night and my what a powerful time we had and I wished I could have just hooked up the television camera and sent it live across Europe last night I know that you would have been tremendously blessed but before we get into that part of the program today I want to say to each one of you who have sent in your prayer request this folder is just full of your needs and also your testimonies many of you have taken the time to call the prayer line or to send an email to say that you have been strengthened that you've been encouraged that you've been blessed by the programs here others have shared urgent prayer requests and thanks be to God we now have added a few testimonies to this stack of those that God has moved already on your behalf he is a faithful God and no matter what the enemy would tell you he still answers prayer he is the same yesterday and today and forever and so I want to encourage you to send your prayer requests to us by email or you can call the prayer line just remember that there's a time difference between Alabama and most of where you are and so you may not get a live person but if you leave your prayer requests it'll be typed up just like these in the folder your needs your name if you leave your name it's there and what you're calling about what your prayer need is and we carry these to the Lord we hold them up before the Lord in every service when I go home they usually go home with me and when I have private time of prayer I take these needs sometimes I open up a stack wherever I turn to and just begin to read that need before the Lord why because we know what happens when we pray in faith we've seen what the Lord can do and we know that prayer is a gift it's a gift that God has given us to be able to lay our needs open before him the book of Matthew talks about a time when Jesus was coming along the way near Jericho and two blind men were there crying out to him the other Gospels mentioned only one man and they mentioned him by name Bartimaeus but in the book of Matthew it says there were two and their cries stop the master there their cries o son of David have mercy on us and it caught the Lord's attention in such a way that he stopped now we know it was very obvious what their need was they were blind even their clothes identified their handicap but Jesus in spite of it being very obvious he asked them what would you have me to do for you and it wasn't that G needed to know what their need was but he wanted them to articulate it he wanted to make sure they knew what they needed and sometimes I have found it to be very very powerful to be very specific when we pray now I don't just say Lord move when I'm really getting down to business I present the need thoroughly before the Lord you know I'm never disappointed even when the answer to my prayer is not exactly as I prayed it I trust the sovereignty of God and I can't ever remember a time and all these years of serving the Lord I can't ever remember a time that I felt like God did not answer my prayer many times it was exactly what I prayed it happened exactly the way that I asked it to be there were some times that I heard an answer and guess what the answer was no that's not what you need but I'll give you something better and he always asked and then there were other times that I thought I knew what the best solution would be so I humbly presented it to the Lord and he moved just not in the way that I expected him to but the answer was precious anyway and it taught me the faithfulness and sovereignty of God so I want to encourage you to pray I want to encourage you to let us join our faith together with your faith let's touch the Lord together and let's see what God can do so you feel free to send in your prayer requests also we've had many people who have mentioned the series that we've been doing schemes and devices and if you have missed one of those episodes we had a few people say I missed a couple of episodes and I feel like I need to go back and get the back material before I move on to the next you can do that on YouTube just do a search for New Hope revival ministries on YouTube you'll find our channel there every episode of the schemes and devices series will be there available Brother Hicks when he was with us the last time his testimony it's right there on YouTube and after today if you didn't hear the testimony you're going to want to go back I guarantee you're gonna want to go back and listen to the other program where he shared his life and how God just beautifully sovereignly lovingly orchestrated his life and has given him the powerful ministry that he has today you can find all of that on youtube under new hope revival ministries and there's a little subscribe button up at the top if you click on that you'll be notified from YouTube when we add new content I think that's a wonderful thing and it doesn't get on my nerves I subscribe to quite a few channels and I enjoy knowing when there's something new to see let me tell you something I believe that feeding on the word of God is the best pastime you can have it's not only entertaining because it thrills the inner man but it gives us the nutrition and the nourishment that we need to continue to grow in Christ there's so much garbage out there there's so much filth out there so much negative out there when I can get a hold of something that is life-giving something from the truth of God's Word it sustains me and strengthens me and I know that many of you feel the same way so at this time I want to just say again brother Hicks god bless you thank you for being with us today you know you were here quite early in in this setting when we were really just sort of getting started again in this little studio that the Lord has given us and your testimony not only touched me when you gave it in our church but it touched a lot of people out there and I hope you don't mind me saying this but I feel like that there were people who said in fact they wrote and said if God can use that little man if God can can do that in his life and orchestrate those circumstances it looked bad it looked bleak and it looked dark but God turned your life around to use for his glory and people wrote and said I know God can do something for me so your testimony on this program gave hope to a lot of people and I want to thank you for that well I certainly want to give God all of the praise the glory and the honor for that and I was thinking just a moment ago how that when we look in the Old Testament the book of kings and the life of the prophet Elijah we find out that uh he discovered a lady who was in a very dark hour of her life and she had lost her husband all she had left in the world that was dear to her or her two sons her husband died suddenly and in doing so he left behind a great debt with no provision to take care of that debt and this lady was was at her wits end her back was against the wall she had been pushed into a corner she just did not feel like there was any possible way out and eventually the day arrived when the creditor knocked on the door and gave her the information that she had dreaded to hear yes that she only had a certain amount of days to come up with a very large sum of money to take care of the debt and if she was not able to do so he was going to take the only thing she had left her two sons and was going to make slaves out of them no doubt when she closed the door behind her it must have been a very very dark hour for her and no doubt she was sinking in despair as many are today in our world there are so many many people who feel like they are literally sinking in a sea of despair they just do not really feel like they're ever gonna be able to pull themselves out of the hole they're in they wonder if they'll ever be able to see the light of day again and no doubt her son's tried to comfort her they tried to remain strong and confident they tried to assure her that somehow everything is going to be alright and in spite of wanting to believe everything they said she still struggled with the fact that how could things ever be all right as dark as it is right now but the day finally arrived when she realized that I have an answer an answer I don't know why I haven't thought of before now and she shared it with her sons she said I'm going to the Prophet I'm going to the man of God if anybody has an answer if anybody can help the Prophet the man of God will be able to help and so she quickly made her way to the man of God and no doubt she must have rehearsed in her mind over and over time and again exactly what she was going to say to the man of God and when she arrived she began to share her story and upon hearing the woman's story the man of God looked at this lady and asked her to very important questions number one what shall I do for thee and number two what do you have in your house these were not the questions she expected to hear fact is she really did not even know how to respond but when she was finally able to respond she simply told the man of God I don't have anything in my house it except a pot of oil I'm the man of God looked at this woman who thought she was in the darkest hour of her life and said go and borrow the vessels abroad of all thy neighbors even empty vessels borrowed not a few he said when you come in shut the door upon you and upon your sons and begin to pour out she left the man of God a little bewildered no doubt his response was not at all what she expected it was not at all what she anticipated because she probably thought in her mind once I share my story with the man of God he's probably gonna pull out some money and give it to me from the church Treasury and say pay your debt and live happily ever after or perhaps the man of God is going to get me an audience with the king and when the King hears my pitiful plight he's gonna order that my debt be forgiven me however that's not at all what happened the man of God said go and borrow the vessels abroad of all thy neighbors that's not what she wanted to hear that's not what she expected sometimes what we hear from God sometimes what we hear from the Word of God is not always what we expect it's not always what we want but in the end it's always what we need and when she when she reached her house her boys were anxious they wanted to know what the outcome of the visit had been and they were so surprised when she shared the story no doubt they must have shook their heads in disbelief they must have said one to another there has to be a better way there has to be something that's more certain that's more sure than this but with a deadline staring them in the face with all of their options exhausted with all of their avenues travelled down they finally decided at the last moment that they would just see if what the man of God said would work and so they got the old wagon out of the barn started down the road and before very long the talk of the entire neighborhood was what in the world of is the widows to Boaz going to do with all of these vessels that they have borrowed when they could not borrow another vessel they unloaded them and can you imagine what it must have been like they were standing in a room surrounded with empty vessels and they were looking at their mother holding a very small vessel of oil in her hand when she finally said bring me a vessel and they brought that vessel and she began to pour out and before long it was full and she set it aside and she asked for another vessel before long it was full and she set that one aside that owned and owned and all until finally she looks at her sons and says bring me another vessel and her boys are standing there with their eyes wide and their mouth gaped open saying there's not a vessel more there's not a vessel more what a beautiful thing that she watched as God miraculously filled up every single empty vessel raised with that valuable oil man she went back to the man of God she was so excited to tell him what had happened and the man of God didn't even get excited he knew exactly what was going to happen and he gave her the command go sell the oil pay their debt and live thou and thy children of the rest of imagine that God not only was concerned about taking care of her present debt but he also wanted to provide her with future provision for her family and the beautiful moral of the story is simply this that when we trust God he can take our nothing come on he can touch it in just the right way and he can make something out of it but not only can God take nothing touch it in just the right way and make something out of it God can also find a nobody somebody whose life is broken somebody's whose life is in shambles of somebody their life is is torn apart by hurt and despair and despondency and he can touch them in just the right way thank you I'll make somebody out of them and we see that God is doing that today he's doing that today in many many places where people finally decide that I'm gonna give God an opportunity I saw a young man the other day I could see the brokenness that was in his heart I could see the brokenness that was in his life and I looked at that young man and I said you know you've tried all of the rest of now what you really need to do is try the best and that's really what I would like to say to somebody today I would like to say that you have tried the rest and you've been hurt and you've been let down and you're still broken and you're still in a world that's filled with despair and despondency but now try the best of try Jesus he'll never let you down he'll never fail you amen Absalom and brother that is so encouraging and he just took what she had which wasn't much right but all what a difference it made when Jesus got involved or when the Prophet got involved in that story share something else just whatever is on your heart that's your camera yes sir and there's no need for me to interrupt you know it's it's amazing today that God has a very very special way at taking nothing touching it in just the right way and making something out of it I think perhaps one of my favorite stories in all of the entire Bible especially the Old Testament must be the account of Elijah the Prophet you know in a time of drought in a time when others were searching desperately for something to eat they were searching desperately for provision physically the Lord had spoke to this prophet and said go into the wilderness go into the desert that was a barren place that was a forsaken place that was a forgotten place don't you know there are many many people today who feel like that unfortunate circumstances of unfortunate events in their life have forced them into a barren place active force them into a wilderness force them into a desert place and no doubt when he arrived in that wilderness of he must have wondered that where is my provision going to come from where am I gonna find food where am I gonna find water and little did he know that God had already divinely commissioned a raven of all birds a raven to bring him bread and flesh in the morning to eat bread and flesh in the evening to dorita he was able to drink water out of the brook and as long as God wanted him to stay there the Ravens brought him bread and flesh and he drank water out of the brook and when it was time for him to leave that wilderness when his time of being alone his time of being in solitude was over God had divinely commissioned that now not a raven but a widow of all people who was going to be able to divinely take care of him but little did the know that when she decided to take care of the Prophet that God was going to open a door for provision in her life God said leave the wilderness go to the gate of the city when you arrive at the gate of the city he told the prophet Elijah you'll find a woman there she'll be gathering sticks and that woman will be able to sustain thee that woman's going to have the provision to take care of you when he lied to made his way to the gate of the city he had no idea that that woman was coming in the opposite direction at the same time she would be there gathering sticks if she had no idea that she was going to encounter a prophet a man of God that would ultimately change the entire course of her future when she arrived at the city gate begun to gather her sticks the prophet of God came walking up without really even exchanging pleasantries he just simply asked the woman would you fetch me a vessel of water that I might drink out of the kindness of her heart she turned to get the man of God the Prophet some water to drink he said excuse me while you're at it would you bring me a little cake of bread that I might eat also now I can just see this woman in my mind's eye as she spins around on her he olap she must have put her hand on her hip and said wait a minute a vessel of water to drink is one thing but a cake of bread to eat is entirely another you must understand that all I have left in all of the world is just a handful of meal in a barrel and a little all in a cruise of however the man of God said go do as thou has said but bake me a little cake first bring it to me that I might eat and so I can see this woman as she turns and as she starts to walk away she must have been thinking about that boy who was laying at home on his stomach must have been growling she had already resigned herself to the fact that she and her son were going to eat their very last meal and die she had already resigned herself to the fact that without a miracle without something miraculous taking place she was going to eat her very last meal she had no idea that she was going to encounter a prophet she had no idea that she was going to hear a word from the Lord that if she chose to implement if she chose to believe if she chose to put it into action in her life it was gonna turn her world upside down and so as she's walking away she must have started thinking one more cake of bread is not gonna make me any better or any worse if God don't step on the same yeah one more cake of bread is not gonna make me any better or any worse if God doesn't somehow stretch out his hand and go to work in my life and so it is that she went in she poured the meal out of the barrel she poured the oil out of the cruse if she made the tiny cake of bread she got the vessel of water she took it to the man of God she gave it to him he blessed it he ate it and then he told her now go and make for you and for your son and live now the writers of antiquity tell us that the drought lasted about a hundred more days and for the space of a hundred days or as long as the drought lasted it made no difference how many times day or night that woman went to the meal barrel the Bible said the meal wasted not no matter how many times she poured out of the cruse of oil the Bible said the cruse of oil that did not fail imagine while others were dying of starvation while others were searching frantically in every place they could think of for a morsel of food to eat no matter how many times they or night this woman decided to go to the meal barrel or the cruse of oil the Bible said the meal wasted not and the cruse of oil did not fail because she decided to believe the word of the Lord I can promise you today yes that the word of the Lord is true I can promise you today that the word of the Lord is trusted a man you can trust the Word of God today fact is he even invites us in other places to prove him yes hallelujah the fact is if he encourages us to put him to the test because he literally wants to roll up his sleeves and he wants to go to work in our life one writer said it like this God will work but who will let him I want to challenge somebody today no matter where you are in life no matter how you feel no matter what you're going through no matter what your face and give God an opportunity to go to work in your life yes you might say you don't know what the doctor has said you haven't seen the x-ray you don't feel the pain you don't understand the hurt but I can promise you today that God is a mighty God he is a magnificent wonderful God who wants to go to work in your life he wants to heal if you're sick he wants to deliver if you're bound he wants to set free if you're held captive he wants to make well today if you have wrestled with physical pain in your life he just simply wants you to give him the opportunity to work in your life see God wants to take your nothing whatever that might be yes and he wants to touch it and make something out of it man perhaps today you feel like a nobody maybe your dreams are broken maybe your heart is broken maybe your home is broken maybe your relationship is broken but today God is a specialist is taking broken things and putting them back together and what I have discovered in my own life is that when God puts the broken back together it's often much more value than it was before it was ever broke amen brother yes praise God and so I want to challenge somebody today I want to encourage somebody today to just simply allow God to take whatever they have touch it in just the right way and make something out of it and you know it's just been on my heart now for days I don't know exactly why but I just have been thinking over and over and over again about those 10 lepers who came to Jesus and Jesus willingly cleanse them of their leprosy and we know how dreaded leprosy is we know that leprosy ostracized and separated and isolated individuals we know that according to the Old Testament and the New Testament that if someone had leprosy they had to live without the campus they had to be separated from their companions they had to be separated from their children they had to be separated from the people that they loved and they cared about and we know that leprosy was so horrible that it literally would eat away the very appendages of the human body it would eat away the ears on the side of your head it would eat away the nose on the front of your face it would eat your fingers off of your hand your toes off of your feet it was a very very dreaded thing and here art in leprous men who come to the Lord Jesus and they cry out to Jesus for him to cleanse them of their leprosy and the Lord Jesus has mercy upon them and he cleanses them divinely of their leprosy and he gives them a command to go and to show themselves to the priests so that the priest can publicly pronounce that they are cleansed when the priests made the public Proclamation that they were cleansed that simply meant they were no longer contagious praise God that they could be invited back into the camp they could be invited back into the home they could be invited back into the city a man and so they were anxious to go to the priest and ma how they must have felt when the priest pronounced over them you now cleansed you are now clean these ten lepers were excited they were anxious to get back to their families to get back to their children to get back to their homes to get back to the people they loved the most and as they started that direction something happened in the life of one of those men something took place of this in the life of one of those men as he started toward his house he stopped somewhere in the middle of his journey and he said I cannot take another step forward toward the people I love until I turn around and give the Lord thanks did you know there's somebody today yep who needs to stop what they're doing they need to stop where they are in the middle of everything that's going on around them they just simply need to give the Lord Jesus Christ something yes sir hallelujah the Bible did not say give thanks for all things sometimes we interpret that passage to say that and you know what we scratch our head and we wonder how can I thank God for heart trouble mm-hmm how can I thank God for cancer how can I thank God for arthritis how can I thank God for a companion that is not in the church how can I thank God for a wayward child who's not concerned about their eternal destination that passage does not tell us no to thank God for those things that passage simply tells us in everything give thanks that's in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you I may not be able to thank God for cancer right in the middle of it I can give y'all may not be able to thank God for bankruptcy but in the middle of it I can give God thank you there's something about looking beyond the hurt and the pain and the loss of and just simply deciding to give God thanks so let's mote will miraculously bring heaven down to where you are but not only will it bring heaven down to where you are it will lift you up yes to where he is hallelujah and so it is that that Lipper turned and started back to Jesus and when he reached the place where the Lord Jesus was at the Lord Jesus wanted to know what have you come back for and that leper said the priest has pronounced cleansing and I cannot go anywhere else until I say thank you Jesus was astounded imagine how he must have felt as he's looking at this leper who could have been now with his family embracing the ones that he loved and cared about so much yes but instead of going to them he turns to the Lord Jesus Christ and says I want to give you thank you the Lord said were there not ten cleansed this leper shook his head yes there were ten cleansed jesus asked the question where are the nine where are the nine why is it that you are the only one who decided to come back and give things understand that this leper had no ulterior motive he did not have anything else in mind he would have been perfectly satisfied had the Lord Jesus not said anything else and he turned and walked away but when he decided to give the Lord some things yes the Lord Jesus said because you have decided to come back and give thanks now go on your way and be thou made whole hallelujah I believe that we are entering a season where God wants to take the broken and make them whole when they decide to give him thanks I believe that God wants to reach down and he wants to touch the heard SS and make them whole when they decide to simply give the Lord things somebody said what does that really mean there were nine lepers although they were clean clean and being clean is wonderful it made no difference where they went in life they still carried in their bodies the science core of their leprosy while they still carried in their physical body the scar is resting of their leprosy by my mom but here is one leper it made no difference where he went in life no bomb I ever knew that he had encountered leprosy at school why because not only it was he cleanse but because he decided to give the Lord Jesus some thanks the Lord Jesus went one step beyond cleansing and made him whole hallelujah I believe there's some people today that need more than just a cleansing we do what they need is to be made whole yes hallelujah I believe there are some people today that need more than just their sin to be forgiven right but what they truly need yes they need their sin to be remitted yes they need their sin to be removed from them them all they need their sin to be cast as far from this earth as the East is from the West never to be remembered against them anymore hallelu hallelu when our sin is remitted when our sin is removed we're like that leper who turned and gave the Lord thanks and he makes us Oh hallelujah I don't just want to be cleansed I don't just want to be clean but I want to be whole I want to be complete I want to be restored no doubt there are some things that we need to be restored some me joy restored some need hope restored some need health restored some need of their minds of to be restored they've been so clouded and so confused by the things around them oftentimes they don't know where they're at and what they're doing and where they're gonna go next even if they're gonna be able to to survive another day but oh there's a great guy today Jesus who is alive and he's on his throne yes and he's just as mighty he's just as able he's just as capable today as he's always been and the wonderful thing is that God's not only capable but the God that we serve today is willing to touch those that will reach out to him he's willing to touch those that will call upon him God will not turn away the one that calls on him God will not turn his face from the man of woman the boy or the girl whoever they are wherever they are no matter what they're going through no matter what they have or do not have God will never turn his face from the individual who decides to cry out and call upon him and I just believe today that there's some people that have been stricken by sin that have been starved by sin the same way this individual was scarred by leprosy amen and it's the blood of Jesus that cleanses us today from all of our sin a man but thank God not only does he want to cleanse us but if we'll just be willing to give him some thanks he'll go one step beyond cleansing and he'll make us whole that simply means that old things pass away and behold everything will become new just a few days ago I was talking with someone and after preaching and I having a beautiful service a young man walked up to me and he put his arms around me embraced me and he said brother Hicks he said I am convinced the way you preach today and the things that you said and the way that God used you you must have a wonderful set of parents that must have raised you in a wonderful home you must have had a wonderful pastor and you must have grown up in a wonderful church and you must be third or fourth generation in the church and I looked at that young man and I said I wish that were the case however it's not I said you have no idea the road that I walked down you have no idea that I was one of those that came from far that's right I came from far I had to travel a long and it was a winding road it was a dusty road it was a road that was filled with twists and turns and crooks and bends it was a road that was full of obstacles and pitfalls and potholes all along the way but you know what God brought me down that road because of he wanted to bring me to him hallelujah and I am so thankful today that regardless of how broken your life might be God knows how to take the broken pieces and put them back to guess again God knows how to take that that's been scarred and marred by sin and he knows how to touch it in just the right way fact is where I come from we like to say that God is the one who can take a black heart he can wash it in red blood and he can make it white as snow and I'm so thankful today for my brother Hicks I'm focusing in my mind on the word wholeness I don't know if I've ever heard it brought out the way you brought it out with the ten lepers and what a blessing that is I'm thinking of we have a promise of wholeness of being made whole body soul and spirit and and I'd like for you to just speak a word about what what God can do for those who need to be restored not not just like the lepers with their external physical scars what was left over from the leprosy but but the inside you know I'm thinking about that portion of your testimony and I think you told us about anger I think that you were you had dealt with a lot of things growing up initially and and just speak to someone who's watching this program who doesn't maybe need wholeness in the body but they recognize that there's a big hole in the inside there they're carrying scars maybe they've already come to the Lord but they haven't got wholeness they haven't haven't found that key speak to that would you yes absolutely the fact is today that many many of us we can smile and we look so well we look so healthy and so hold on the outside however many many today are broken yes and they are hurting and they are needy deep deep down on the inside their emotional hurt and their spiritual yes and their mental hurt is such that often people wonder if they can ever ever overcome these things and I like to to kind of tell people that sometimes what we need to do to become whole again is that we need to just pick up what we have left we we just need to pick up what's left we don't need to focus on what we no longer have sometimes that's where we find ourself and sometimes we trap ourselves so good in that position where all we want to do is focus on what we no longer have and if we do that we find ourselves with our head hung down right we find ourselves having a pity party like sorry for ourselves right and when we have a pity party and we feel sorry for ourselves we just sink further and further and further into the darkness and the despair that already surrounds us so true however if we could just somehow forget about what we no longer have forget about what we no longer can put our hands on and just simply pick up what we have left remember he told the disciples after he had miraculously multiplied a little boys lunch that was only five loaves and two small fish it's always amazed me that the Bible said two small fish right and so it is that it's apparent that it only seemed like enough for just a handful maybe three or four at the most to eat and to be filled on however that little boy was willing to give what he had toward and today for us to be healed and to be whole on the inside we have to become willing to give God whatever we have laid yes sir amen the little boy was willingness to give God what he had left he understood it might not be very much right it may only be able at this moment to feed just a handful however I'm willing to give you what I have and that's really what God wants today yes I believe that I believe that that inner healing begins when we simply decide to give God what we have lau that's very hard to give him what's left is short give him what's left of our mind give him what's left of our life whatever it might be no matter how broken it might be to us no matter how broken it might appear to someone right so what we simply need to do is just pick up the broken pieces pick up what we have left and we just need to willingly place it tenderly in the hands of God yes because he is able today to take what we have left and make something miraculous when they started to pick up the King James said gather up the fragments that remain when they started to gather they started to pick up what was left they were amazed because when they were finished they picked up twelve baskets full yes of fragments over above and beyond that what had been eaten after five thousand million plus women and children had eaten all that they could hold praise God and so it is that when we pick up what's left whatever it might be and we just simply give it to God we just simply place it in his hand yes he has a divine way oh yes taking what's left and making something of the powder time I see God can take your mess yeah and he can touch it in a miraculous way here this you can make something magnificent out of a today God wants to take what we might consider a mess and he wants to touch it and turn it into a masterpiece yes please God that's really what he wants to do in your life that's what he wants to do in my life that's what he wants to do in the life of every person who is willing to just simply allow him if we'll just pick up what we have left whatever it is some of us have broken dreams some of us have broken aspirations some of us have broken desires some of us feel today that we're never going to arrive at the place that we longed to be at but you know what God is simply saying today don't isolate ourselves you know in despair and despondency don't hang our heads in pity looking at what we no longer have concentrating on could have been or what might have been or what should have been but all today what we need to do is just pick up what yes and we need to walk into the presence of God and we just need to lay it down at the feet of Jesus oh my imagine what he could do today if we would just fall down at his feet imagine what he could do today if we were just laying what we have left at his yes sir and just simply allow him to Jesus I know exactly what he would do today he would do
