divine order for them as they're making this decision to move this way we want to ask the Lord's blessing upon them all right let's some are traveling out of town there are many needs that are Among Us of all sorts and varieties and I'm glad that my Lord Jesus knows every one of them and he knows how to take care of them let's go to prayer father we just come before you today with Thanksgiving in

things that you may be glorified a amen amen can you give the Lord a shout of Praise today Hallelujah you may have your seats today we're so glad to see you in the house of the Lord with us on this Sunday morning that many are calling Easter Sunday I don't celebrate Easter I celebrate the resurrection and I don't just do it one day a year I celebrated Resurrection in my life and I'm grateful for it every single day because if he had not come up out of the Grave I would be lost in my sins and trespasses I would be wandering around like a lot of this world not knowing what uh what to do or how to go and and what their life is going to end up but when I look around at all of the world's seen and I see darkness and Blackness I then look up and I thank God for the light that he has shed across my pathway that I can know that he is alive and well and he's leading this little bride straight into Victory Hallelujah before we receive the offering today it was a request of brother Daniel Miller that I let the church know that is with joyous heart that they're announcing that their son-in-law Austin with their daughter sister Anna Christine and the granddaughter Gwendolyn they have made the decision to make New Hope their home church and they'll be traveling to Alabama this week they are asking for our prayers as they get all the house listings and all the necessary things done there where they're at and then making their way this way God is helping them and giving them Grace and help along the way testimonies day by day of the grace of God and so we want to remember them this week as they're making their way they're planning to be here in the service next weekend by the grace of God and then they got all the settling in in Alabama so we want to ask the Lord just to help them with every facet of that the Lord is doing great things and I want to be right in the middle of it agreeing with the mind of God agreeing with what the Lord has to say about me about you about this church about the move of God I want to be in agreement with him moment to moment to moment sure we have battles sure we have things that come our way to try to make us doubt but oh God he he is he's my Lord is the one who is helping us to put our doubts under our feet and to rise up in faith to know he that has begun this work in me I've come too far to look back now come too far to look at all of those things that are behind me and get all tripped up in them I want to put my eyes on the prize he is my prize he is my prize brother Donovan Lewis it sure is good to see you today the Lord

like it will never ever [Music] let's give the Lord a hand clap of Praise come on let's do it any good [Applause] he's wonderful he's wonderful and worthy to be praised you may be seated excuse me did you hear my computer brother Greeley was still singing on the computer there's a few a few seconds to lay the Lord is here Josh I want to tell you you did a marvelous exceptional anointed job thank you so much [Applause] we want to tell David how much we appreciate him jumping in on the base and I thought you did really good God bless you for that I know that that's not his comfort zone but he was willing this morning and God honored that and used it and I appreciate it very very much the Lord is good to us isn't he I'm sorry that I'm holding you up here just a minute but uh I I didn't take time I I guess the service came to me a little sooner than I was expecting somehow I don't know why it's about the right time and I wasn't quite ready I had a lot of things on my mind um I don't like to do such a thing as this and and disturb people I know some of you have small children and you can't really make a move but I'm wondering if we could have anybody to come anybody would come and just sit up close here is there anybody that would be willing to move up a little bit from the back and and just kind of fill in that little spot there this one time thank you all so much for doing that um I don't know why it's important but I just had the thought there either the second Pew or or whatever you want to do you can move I think maybe maybe Ashley and David were there I don't know but just whatever thank you all so much and we appreciate that um you know if I were you I would want to find this close of a place as I could if I didn't have small children to take care of it's always good the closer you get to the fire the warmer you can get right and um thank you so much for doing that without disturbance I really do appreciate it let me get this out of the way because I have an unusual uh message prepared uh charity uh this morning I print my notes I only have 20 pages of notes for today so we're doing good on time that usually takes about eight hours I can usually draw a series out of 20 Pages for three weeks um but charity was putting all of the quotes in and I needed them all in sometime I don't need them all in but I needed them all in because I was so unsettled about which part of my sermon to preach first aren't you glad that you don't have that problem I don't have some of your problems on the job I I I've still not 100 settled I I've really got three I told charity two she said brother Shelley with all these quotes she said I better go home and change the timing on my oven for lunch and uh but I really got three separate and yet connected messages on my heart this morning and I don't know which one to start with I wished I had a mind that was a little more analytical although I find that that can be in hindrance to the supernatural but I wished I had a little bit more of an analytical mind if I did I could lay this out and I could say now this is the foundation and if I say that first then I could come in here and build on that and it'd get a little higher and then I could bring this but I don't have that kind of a mind and so I just have to do the best I can let me get out of the way uh get this out of the way and say that we have a few birthdays I want to mention this week and one is on Tuesday uh April the 19th sister Gabriella a long time friend of of my wife and I and sister Alfreda and this whole church she has a birthday on Tuesday she's not only a long time friend but a long time streamer and although we don't call her name out that often she's there and she's a part of what God has been doing here for such a long time and I remember uh her excitement I do I remember her excitement nearly 25 years ago when the message got to her that I was going to be married and she made her way all the way from Germany to be here for our wedding and I remember that and I I love that family on the 21st which is Thursday of this week Luke Jernigan has a birthday is that right where is Luke is that right you're going to be what 21 on the 21st 17 on the 21st so God bless you I guess that's about four more years before we have to stop calling you lookie right and start calling you by a little bit more of an adult name and on Thursday of this week also is Nathan and shoshana's wedding anniversary how many is this four years happy anniversary to them both God bless you [Applause] we've had plenty of singing and um you know we didn't make any arrangements for an Easter egg hunt or anything like that this morning but I liked it that brother Greely mentioned that so many uh religious people uh go to church one day a year this is their day I pray that God will show up manifest himself and call every one of them to real salvation I know the Lord is certainly able to do that we're not Easter people here we believe in the resurrection but the resurrection is not a party it's not even a day it's a person Jesus said I am the resurrection and the life and I think what the world has called Easter is really a pagan uh doing really has very little to do with Christ it existed I think about all the precious sincere Christians who got up this morning all facing the Rising Sun just like the pagans did for thousands of years not even realizing that by the time the sun got up Jesus had already been out of the Grave for hours the scripture said so already been out of the Grave for hours and so you might as well just sleep in and come at the regular time and enjoy the goodness of the lord we used to do that and God met us because we were sincere and we didn't know exactly what we were doing but we don't show any no criticism or condemnation just don't expect us to have a big pageant here or something like that I don't think we sung one although I woke up this morning in the shower singing up from the grave Hill Rose we're the mighty Triumph or his foe foam in the dark domain and he lives forever with his Saints to Reign here arose here goes Hallelujah Christ arose you can't help but think about it but when we wake up in the morning we can sing the same song [Music] for so many years so many lamps were offered up and all the blood that was spilled could never feel that bitter cut up till one spotless lamb in the form of man gave his life on Calvary his was the only blood that could ever set men free [Music] for his blood was not just blood of another spotless lamb his blood was Precious Blood for it washed the sins man and his blood my body and it sets my spirit free I'm so glad this Precious Blood Still flows from Calvary [Music] no other blood could heal my broken body and no other blood could save my sin since its Souls no other blood could conquer death and win my story no other blood but the blood that Jesus sheds for me singing me with you for his blood was not just blood of another spot please [Music] block was Precious Blood for it washed the sins of man and his blood here my body oh sets my spirit free [Applause] I'm so glad this precious blood still flows from Cowboys sing this part no other blood could heal my broken body had no other blood could save my sin sick Souls no other blood can't conquer death and win my victory there's no other blood but the blood Jesus shared for me [Music] his blood was not just blood of another spot his blood was precious blood for it washed the sins of man and his blood heals my body oh and it sets my spirit free I'm so glad this Precious Blood Still blows from Calvary and there is power power Wonder working Power in the Blood there is power power Wonder working power in the Precious Blood of the Lamb again there is power power Wonder working power and the blood of the Lamb there is power power life will I know it was the blood I know it was the blood I know it was the blood for me one day when I was lost he died upon the cross I know it was the blood for me well I know it was the blood I know it was the blood I know it was the blood for me one day when I was lost he died upon the cross I know it was the blood for me and there is power power Wonder work in Power in the Blood of the Lamb there is power power Wonder working power in the Precious Blood of the land [Music] sorry let's thank God for these musicians they cover up for me so good when I jump in on a song that I don't have the right key for they're just precious I appreciate that God bless every one of you who are here this morning streaming this service returning to the Song of Solomon chapter 2 beginning in verse 10. second Solomon excuse me second Solomon Song of Solomon Chapter 2. verse 10 God bless every one of you who are streaming this service this morning may the Lord meet you with his presence I pray something will be said that will help you bless you strengthen you along the way let me know when you're there my beloved spoke and said unto me rise up my love my fair one and come away next verse for law the winter is past the rain is over and gone you must understand that this was written in another land not ours in the land of the Bible winner is the rain in Alabama spring is the rain so when you read that the rain is over and gone you're reading about how it is in the land of the Bible and I want you to know this is the most exciting time uh botanically to be in Israel because there are more wildflowers in Israel than perhaps any nation in the world and they they take good care of them and protect them and the winner is by the time summer is over those those hills and mountains are so dry and so Barren and so bare that they look like desert but by the time the winter rains have come and the wind and the weather begins to warm up those mountains Break Forth with the most beautiful green and with the most beautiful puppies and so many wildflowers and even while it is yet cold the almonds begin to bloom their beautiful buds and announce to the whole land that winter is past the rain is over and gone the flowers appear on the Earth the time of the singing of birds is come and the voice of the turtle that's not the reptile that's the turtle dove and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land let me read those verses quickly again before you're seated my beloved spake and said unto me rise up my love my fair one and come away for law the winner is past the rain is over and gone the flowers appear on the earth the time Hallelujah the time of the singing of birds is come and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land father we want to thank you that you are God alive you are God's Supreme you are God right on time this morning I feel you now gathering around us by the presence of the Holy Spirit and I need you Lord you've laid some things on my heart to share and uh I need help with it it's one of those things where I really need your help and I thank you that you're coming even now to prepare our hearts for a prophetic word that comes from you today and we receive it Lord and we ask that you give your servant Grace to deliver it we just take authority over anything that would hinder the word and we ask God that you would uh open up our hearts and pour in the faith that we would just reach right up and be able to take you at your word and be helped be strengthened be encouraged be blessed and we'll give you the honor and the glory for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and the saint said you may be seated I have not always been able to speak to you as I want to speak to you this morning there came a time when there was such skepticism it gets on us we went through a 10-year period of fellowship and association with a broader part of the church at Large we hosted conferences here and were blessed very blessed we understand that it was for a season and it served a purpose and there are many people watching this service and even a few here this morning because of that season of ministry that the lord gave us and we thank God for it I I really thank God for it he told us that we would give and we would receive and we have done that that was the graciousness and the mercy of Our Lord but we are on a fast track and the fast track has a lead car and the lead car has r o j c on it I don't know if anybody remembers that I can almost guarantee very few of you do by the look on your face but it was a dream that the lord gave me a clear dream and it was during that time and if we he told me in that dream that if I was going to be on the fast track I would have to follow the car that said r-o-j-c [Music] I said well Lord what is r-o-j-c he said revelation of Jesus Christ that's what you got to follow and so I'm here this morning doing my best to follow that without a revelation of Jesus Christ we're just another church are you with me I want to give you a series of prophetic events I don't want to say before I preach I'm preaching now but before I really take a text if I would choose something out of the verses that I just read I would say winner is past and spring is appearing the birds are beginning to sing in the voice of the turtle dove is being heard again in our land I don't know if there are any C.S Lewis fans here or not but I have enjoyed the writings of C.S Lewis and I have recognized the prophetic nature of some of those writings and I have lived in the prophetic nature of some of those writings and I had three nights of Dreams this week that I won't go into the dreams this morning but Monday Tuesday and Wednesday night of this week I dreamed all three nights that we were in Narnia that make-believe land of C.S Lewis and what a battle we were involved in and there were all the creatures that you might imagine if any of you ever saw the adaptation the movies that were made uh I think by Disney of The Lion and the Witch and the Wardrobe and and uh The Voyage of the Dawn Treader and what was what was the last the next one or the the third of the three Prince Caspian um you will know this unusual these unusual creatures minotaurs and and other uh mythological type beasts well I have seen those in in dreams and experiences before I ever knew anything about the writings of C.S Lewis in the Holiness Church that I grew up in we were not encouraged to pursue such literature so I was a grown man nearly well age-wise I was for sure before I ever read them for myself now I'm not putting them on some high spiritual level I'm just saying by my own experiences I would say that C.S Lewis had more than just a overactive imagination I would say that he understood some things that a lot of people may or may not understand I want to give you a call and I believe charity has it that has meant something to me through the years from C.S Lewis and I'll tell you why in just a little bit wrong will be right when Aslan comes in sight if you are watching this and you're not familiar with Aslan he was the Magnificent lion that C.S Lewis wrote about and the lion was crucified murdered and rose again which certainly lets us know that he was written to be a type of a savior the Lord Jesus Christ so when I read about Aslan some of you are looking at me funny when I read about Aslan when I saw the films that were made I had no problem seeing him as the lion of the tribe of Judah the root and The Offspring of David this means a lot to me I'll share it with you again wrong will be right when Aslan comes in sight at the sound of his Roar Sorrows will be no more when he Bears his teeth winter meets its death and when he shakes his Mane we shall have spring again powerful anybody think that's powerful literature it's not only powerful but it's prophetic and it reminds me of the Song of Solomon winner is past the rain is gone and now the flowers appear in the earth and the sound of the birds singing and the turtle's voice is heard again in the land in order to explain to you just a little bit in the monitor in order to be able to explain to you what I mean I have to read from my dreams is that all right and then I will read from the writings of sister Isabel Weems but first from my own post on Facebook this was dated September the 8th 2010. 11 years ago soon nearly 11 years ago is that right soon 12. that's what it meant I dreamed I was in a land like Narnia last night a battle was brewing and Saints were weary and many had been taken captive by a spirit that had turned them into blocks of ice similar to the scene portrayed in the movie Miracles were beginning to happen Among Us and we were feeling waves of excitement from the distance whoo I lost my breath from a distance we heard a lion's roar and we began to shout as lands on the move Aslan is on the move shouts of Victory were heard in our camp and later I was just giving highlights for Facebook later he released his breath on us and we in turn were breathing over those who were frozen and Resurrection Life was being released anybody with me in the end it was about sitting still on the grass and hearing truths from aslan's mouth that would transfigure us and eventually translate us into a new kingdom so I ended the post by saying don't be weary Saints Aslan the lion of the tribe of Judah is on the move I want to say to you today don't be weary Saints the lion of the tribe of Judah is on the move if anybody believes that I want you to say Amen amen that's right we ought to give God praise now we had prayer directives weekly for many years and sister Carmen her family put them together and Jonathan Hollis helped and elfrida help sister Alfreda helped and others and when they were no longer in our ministry sister Weems she took on this huge job it's a huge job to put these together and I use them in my research oftentimes and I not only have them and use them but I use sister Nancy's because she wrote also a newsletter from Jerusalem that was filled with nuggets from our services here from sermon in fact the prayer directives and the Jerusalem updates uh contain some dreams and visions that are never mentioned anywhere else they're not even in our database so we are still trying to get some of those out so that they can be in the database I see I'm boring some of you this is not for you then so I'll just say sleep on this morning this is only for those who have a heart to hear I'm not trying to be ugly I'm trying to be as honest and sincere as I possibly know how there should be no reason why that we wouldn't have Liberty this morning to share these things it's a part of who we are it's a part of our spiritual DNA it's what sets us apart from all the other churches around our area here I'm just being honest I'm just being honest it's that little Edge that we want to give God praise for so that was September the 8th of 2010 that I shared it it happened the night before and in the prayer directives sister Weems took from that post and from my telling I guess it would have been sister Weems in 2010 from my telling of it in a service when I got home I was at the beach when this happened when I got home and told it this is what she wrote in the prayer directive in the prayer directives there is Warfare going on in the realm of the spirit for our future and our destiny a recent dream in Technicolor colorful dream that brother Shelley had showed a place similar to the scenes in the movies about Narnia he dreamed that a spirit had been loosed against the bride of Christ and was taking the Saints captive they were not bound with chains but they had been frozen he saw people he knew that he didn't expect to be in that condition and then he noticed that the Saints who were not frozen were dragging around so weary and tired that they were at the point of giving up there was a Warfare going on for our future and our destiny and then from the distance he heard the Roar of a lion so strong it made his ribs vibrate and the ground around him shook the prophets have spoken that God is releasing the courage and Valor of a lion to us in this hour when the lion began to Roar the people began to shout Aslan is on the move encouragement Came Upon every weary Soldier and people realize that we have not been forgotten and shouts of Victory begin to go up he said that Aslan breathed on us with this warm breath that had the most overpowering smell of roses brother Shelley then remembered our Frozen comrades and he went to breathe on them they thought out as resurrection power was released and would finish the sentence they were speaking when they had become Frozen they had received a resurrection life that transforms and transfigures us into the image of the Lord Aslan told our pastor that he would answer his question it was a question he had brought to the Lord before he went to sleep that night he went on to tell us that we climbed up to a high place and Aslan began to talk we sat in the grass and listened to the truths that were coming out of his mouth truths that would transform us and translate us into a new kingdom Miracles broke out which encouraged us to demonstrate the power of God everyone was feeling waves of excitement brother Shelley knew that the most desirable place for us to be in this hour was to be in grass with Aslan he encouraged Us by saying don't be weary because Aslan is on the move he is demonstrating his power the new model hear this the new model of ministry that is coming is the demonstration of the spoken word that was the answer to the question everything else is getting us there it's so important in this hour to come into agreement with God's word in everything I'm still reading from the prayer directives and then the next section the racetrack dream in another dream the next night he saw that we were going to a racetrack race and as we were going up the hill putting on our helmets an official looking man said not this time the pastor spoke up what do you mean that's our racetrack the man looked at him with a compassion and said you can't race on that track because the Lord wants you on the fast track when they arrived at the fast track he saw cars lined up but he didn't recognize his car so the man pointed to it and on the side of the race car it said r o j c the man was saying that on the fast track the car would have to be now in dream life cars represent Ministries transportation in a dream usually represents a Ministry or a demonstration of ministry the man was saying that on the fast track the car would have to be the revelation of Jesus Christ and in parentheses she put brother Branham preached the revelation of Jesus Christ series but we can also say now that the entire message that the Lord has given to us in our day that whole message is the revealing of the Lord Jesus Christ he no longer hides behind the lattice he no longer hides in the shadows but he is now unveiled apocalypses he has now unveiled himself and revealed himself to his people sister Weems went on to write the two dreams are connected because Aslan who represents Christ was telling truths to transform us and translate us into a new kingdom in order for the bride to come into her promised Revival we'll have to have a true revelation of end time events God is not going to lead his bride blindly we won't move into the bride's Revival that spoken word Revival until enough people get a revelation of what it's really about God is going to give us a clear understanding of how things are going to be because he wants his people to know what will transpire the new model of ministry is the spoken word everything else is getting us there can anybody say Amen now that prayer directive was from September the 11th of 2010 and on May the 12th 2011 I posted that a quote that we just read you of C.S Lewis three nights Monday night Tuesday night Wednesday night of this week I dream battle scenes from uh narnia-like land I saw there were times that the army of light was winning I mean they were taking ground and pushing the enemy back and then there were times that the that the Army of Darkness would come and start encroaching and taking bits and uh pieces of land that had been occupied by God's people and little by little it was happening so subtly so uh in such small increments I hope you'll bear with me that we didn't realize how much ground had been lost because this enemy was just taking little pieces and little pieces and little pieces and little piece this is how the enemy does the Bible are you with me the Bible said the little foxes what do they do they small the vine it's not the big old wolves that come marching in breathing hot air it's those little things that the enemy uses to take our ground and to encroach Upon Our Authority and our power and we're really backing up and we don't even realize that we're backing up giving ground that doesn't belong to the enemy it's the bride's inheritance I want to say to you today that the power and the authority to use the spoken word is the inheritance of the Bride of Jesus Christ and we're going to move in that before we get out of here are you with me so that was Monday Tuesday and Wednesday night dreaming dreaming all night waking up tired because we fought all night there are a lot of little things I could share but it doesn't matter because in the last dream I saw an ultimate victory and it was because of this other dream that came into play it I was reminded when I woke up it was the fact that Aslan was on the move again and he had on purpose held his peace while winter was doing its thing but in the spring when winter was over those long dark winners that President Biden spoke about during the pandemic those long dark deadly mournful sad winners we're coming to an end and spring was springing up and birds were singing again on Thursday of this week after dreaming that we went to Montgomery for some wedding business and on the way home brother Daniel Miller sent a text and he said brother Shelley will there be any way that you could in the next couple of days go and look at a house for us and see if it's something that we we should rent and I said sure in fact we're leaving Montgomery now and we can go by and look at this house was easy to find very close to Tiger Town and in the meantime I said well we can look in the windows and see the neighborhood and things like that did you want us to try to make an appointment to go inside and he said well yes he said in fact I'm trying to set that up right now I was going to have the agent there and offer you an opportunity to go in and look and maybe even give us a virtual tour I said sure I can do that now I had a hard time knowing how to run the phone I'm going to go ahead and tell you before my kids tell you my boys they kept saying no Daddy no Daddy no that ain't the right daddy that ain't the right way you got to do you got to do it this way I couldn't get it to turn around right and and then I realized I'm just doing like this it was some Tour all right the little fellow was was Korean and he didn't want to touch us he was afraid he would give him virus and it was just an unusual kind of thing all together just an unusual kind of thing but a kind of a nice house a very nice neighborhood and very convenient only about 23 minutes from here and um we were waiting on the agent to get there and so I went for a walk my boys were grumbling because it was taking too long and we've been waiting longer than we should have and I thought I don't have to sit here and listen to this bellyaching it's a beautiful spring day I'll just go walk up and down the road here so I walked up the road and walked back down the road and I didn't hear a bird anywhere but this the Sun was shining and it was just a beautiful day it was there was a nice breeze and all of a sudden I either brother Daniel I think brother Daniel called me and he didn't want me to have to wait too long and all of a sudden I'm standing out in the middle of the road and he calls and there is a bird several Birds that come out of nowhere I hadn't seen a bird they come out of nowhere and they come like torpedoes not Birds they come flying toward me so fast that I had to move to keep from being hit and they landed on a limb of a tree right near where I was standing and you have never heard such singing they weren't angry they just sang a concert and I thought I I'm not going to mention that I'm not going to mention what just happened but this is a little unusual to get bombarded by by birds three or four Birds almost knocked me over trying to get away from them and now they're sitting just a few feet away on a limb and they're all looking at me like they have been sent here to give me a concert and they were so loud that I think I better move away because I can hardly concentrate and brother brother Daniel said oh I can hear the birds singing and I laughed I said I guess you can I didn't even tell him what had just happened as I started walking back to the vehicle the scripture came to me just out of the blue it seemed winter is past the rains are gone the flowers appear in the land and the time of the singing of the birds is come I said Lord thank you thank you for that little confirmation for me that you are really doing something and I want to be a part of it I don't want to miss it I want to see Frozen Saints unthawed I want to see the living breath of the Lion of the tribe of Judah deliver and liberate and set God's people free so I said Lord I'm taking this as a sign from you now I hesitate to say these things and one of the reasons why I do is because it has been said that these things that we mention like this are sensationalism so I have been really reluctant for a long time to really share what it means for me to live for him daily but I want you to know it's a daily Adventure when you serve the Lord he don't go away till you come back to church on Sunday he's with you every day and if you have ears to hear and ask to see you'll see him you'll hear him you'll recognize that he is with you so that was Thursday so Monday Tuesday Wednesday dream Narnia battles was reminded of this experience the breath breathing on the Frozen Saints they were halfway into a into a statement when the when the freeze came and as soon as the breath was blown on them they very quickly defrosted and thought out and they finished the sentence that lets me know that the enemy came in in such an unexpected way so suddenly so to speak that people were paralyzed and frozen out missing what what life is really supposed to be about if you know anything about the lion and the witch in The Wardrobe in the story you you come into a winter wonderland it looks like but it's really a land that has been in a winner for years because of power uh in the in yes in the book in the story a witch a power has taken over this land and has plunged it into an eternal winter time but oh what a difference can be made when God begins to move again and Aslan begins to move again the story was he'd gone away for a long time and now he had come back to deal with winter I'm so thankful for the whole analogy and and the whole the whole paradigm that God really began to talk to me about over 12 years ago so Friday morning I woke up are you still here Friday morning I woke up April 15th I was supposed to have lunch with someone here in the church but I realized that I was not quite ready to file my extension it was April 15th tomorrow is the deadline the 18th this year but I needed to make sure that I got that done it was kind of Weighing on me heavy and in order to do that I was going to have to give them some money and I didn't want to give them any money when I looked down and see how much I've already given them but my wife's income is 10.99 and so we have to pay taxes on that every year uh so we went from refunds to paying taxes because there's nothing taken out on that and it can really be a chunk and even though her income from the oils is way way down from what it was it's still a chunk of taxes and she saves it in her in in her money and but I just hate giving it to him [Music] I just don't think they deserve it so I put it off and put it off and put it all and finally give it to him at the last minute you can't even really file an extension properly without paying them what you owe them you can set up some arrangements but some people think if you file an extension that means you can wait to pay your taxes but that's not what it means at all it means you go ahead and pay what you think you owe and if it comes out that you don't you're going to pay penalty and interest already on top of that so I rushed over here my wife had put the money in my account and I rest over here and and what's going to get that done and I knew I wouldn't make my lunch appointment and I knew I had to take Benjamin to the airport in Columbus to fly out to Dallas for the weekend and so I had all these things in my mind and I'm driving along on my way to the office and the spirit of the Lord says what day is it I said oh it's Friday I I know that because I just put out my text so it's Friday [Music] and the Lord said to my heart to my spirit you know if you hear him that way if he talks to you in an internal voice sometime you know what it's like it can come like a very very strong thought but you realize I'm not thinking like this I wouldn't think to ask myself such a question like this so This thought comes and said well what what month is it and I said well it's April I said it's April it's Friday in April and then I I said out loud it's getting close to my birthday and I'm going to be 54. ain't that grand that's what I said and the Lord said what's the date and I said I I uh it's in the teens I glanced over at my phone and saw that it was April the 15th so I said it's tax day and I'm on my way you know to pay my taxes on April the 15th and the spirit of the Lord said what else I said I don't know I don't know you said what did you dream for three nights I said well I had Narnia dreams we were in battles and Aslan came and saved us encouraged us and I'm talking out loud if you ever see me going down the road I'm either talking on the phone or talking out loud to myself we don't think I'm crazy just yet I said yes I had a Monday night Tuesday night Wednesday night I had those dreams and then yesterday I I had a bird bomb and the birds were singing and the spirit of the Lord reminded me that winter is past and spring is springing and the birds are singing and all of a sudden the spirit of the Lord said don't you remember that it was on April the 15th that Chuck Pierce gave you and your wife the prophecy no I didn't remember I didn't I came over to the church and I did a search and I found the file three times we have combined and deleted thousands of files but there were still three files of this experience and every one of them was dated 315. and I said I don't know how that's possible because I felt like the Lord was saying it was 4 15. today so I had to do some research and the date had been put in wrong and I was able to go back thank God for good notes I was able to go back and find that I was not in Maryland in March of that year I was there in April and after I found that I went on Facebook memories how many of you ever used that and I had taken a picture of Chuck just as he walked over to us to give us this Prophecy 4 15 2011. so I want to share it with you that are awake is that all right it was in Frederick Maryland at Cornerstone Fellowship where Paul and Cheryl black who have been here uh to visit a pastor he said and this conference was called forging your future from The Unseen Realm it's one of the most powerful conferences that we did in Maryland and Chuck was speaking that morning and he walked over to Stacy and I and he had not yet been here he was scheduled to come to us that year and remember there was that whole thing about the GPS do any of you remember they almost didn't find the church and he started in to tell us we ought to get that fixed and then caught itself and told me later there's a reason for all things just leave it like that he felt like it was even at that time connected to what he had given us 415 2011. 2011 was one of the busiest years of my life I was traveling everywhere preaching I was also in Israel during that time there were a lot of things going on in 2011. this is the transcript of that of that word he said what I see with you two is you have a great church history and a great church setting and because of that God's going to take that place and make it a church in a different dimension does that sound too Sensational for you you know I never thought about the supernatural being sensational it's just Supernatural but it is Sensational when God does what he says but that's not the criticism and because of that God's going to take that place and make it a church in a different dimension we'll walk in all of a sudden they're going to say I'm not sure where I'm at you can laugh many people have already said this some people said I thought I had stumbled into the Mayflower because you people dress like pilgrims he said when people walk in all of a sudden they're going to say I'm not sure where I'm at and listen at this next statement it's going to be like walking into Narnia now I tell you he had no way of knowing that in 2010 I had had all those experiences with Narnia he had no way of knowing that we had never spoken about it and you know he said oh are you reading that book he said I just saw it by the spirit the Lord just said she spoke out Stacy spoke out and said I'm reading that book now this is not in the prophecy but but I also have here where I told the prophecy I won't bother you with that lose you but I will tell you this I did not want her to bring that book you anybody remember that the mcwhators had given us me I think a birthday card with a gift card from Barnes and Noble and I didn't even go in Barnes and Noble anymore because you can just order books and get them and I didn't I didn't go in there but we went in I didn't need anything and we found a big old paperback copy about that big of the collection of C.S Lewis's works and my wife said I'd like to get that so that's what we spent the gift card on but it was huge and when we started to go out the door that morning she said I'm going to go get my book I said that old thing I said isn't that a little big for the airplane she said no I want to read it and I'll have more time to read it while I'm gone so she had even read it that morning while I Was preparing for the service later that day she had already been reading in that book that morning so Chuck didn't know that he said I just saw it by the spirit the Lord just said she said she is reading that book she spoke it out and he repeated it he said it's going to be like walking into Narnia and they're going to say wait a minute I was just out the door here and I've walked in here and I thought I was just coming to church because church history is important and good churches are important and listen to what Chuck said he said and that's who they are that's not Who We Are Chuck was speaking about them himself his movement the people that follow him and and uh he said that's who they are that's not Who We Are you see in that movement they always emphasize Kingdom and so in order to do that they minimalize I've been in the meetings they minimalize the idea of church they do because their focus is Kingdom but now listen to this he said that's who they are that's not who we are and in the midst of it you know it's early it's just 12 50. and in the midst of it the people are going to walk in and say I'm in a different world Lord I'm in a different place here and the Lord says you are going to create a model that causes people to understand Kingdom from church as powerful because this is not what they were teaching he said that's a little hard to do because Church you build it for one season he said that's what the Bible talks about you build Church you unlock the kingdom he looked right at us and he said so that means your church that you have built will become an unlocking place Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah can't you clap better than that let it be so Lord let it be so Lord that's what I wanted to be you see that in itself directly relates to a prophetic experience where we saw the nations of the world locked the saints of God in Africa locked in cages walking around in bird cages their feet hanging out they could move around but they couldn't get rid of these cages and the keys were held in a display case in the vestibule of a message Church and God by his grace gave authority to bust out the keys so that the Saints could be burst out of their cages so for someone to come years later and say this is to be an unlocking place it's exactly confirmation for what we have believed for anybody with us he said now what I'm trying to do I put Pro put vocabulary to where we're at right now I've never prophesied this to anybody he said and so if you're reading Narnia now listen to this he said so if you're reading Narnia you're supposed to find out listen I I just said that didn't I you're supposed to find out what you're going to look like in days ahead so if you're reading Narnia you're supposed to find out what you're going to look like in days ahead and the wars that will be going on in there in the book and in days ahead in a church that's supposed to reveal Kingdom and be established as an unlocking place where people will come in and say I was just going into church and now I find myself in another world anybody with me well are you really preaching the word are you just preaching about our church I'm doing all of that because somebody needs to we need to be reminded that we have a commission [Music] [Applause] and a role to fill that's bigger than Lee County Alabama are you with me now listen you're supposed to find out what you're going to look like in days ahead and the wars that will be going on in there and listen and when you get to the last battle which happens to be one of the last books in the series it is the last book and when you get to the last battle which battle last one is he talking about a book he is it is when you read the last battle when you get to the last battle of the book but he's not just talking about the book this is symbolism you should know this by now he's talking about the last battle does anybody remember what the last battle was the Branham not only said it's the greatest battle ever fought he said it's a last battle the bride will ever have to fight the Battlefield of the Mind anybody getting it now he said when you come when you get to the last battle you're going to understand when you get to the last battle you're going to understand this is who we were meant to be this is are you listening this is who we were meant to be this is who we were meant to be he said all right now that's the word for you now because we're in the spirit up here the spirit of God is up here thank you all for creating an environment for the spirit of God to be here so because of what God was saying and doing it even shifted the environment of where we were in Frederick Maryland and God did some mighty beautiful things in that series of meetings I I would like if I if I had the time I don't but if I had the time I would read some from the transcript of telling that experience here because I realize that there are people here who have never heard that let me just ask you if you've never heard it in that much detail you're part of this church and you've never heard any of that in that much detail just hold up your hand and let me see your hand for just a minute so that's quite a few people don't you think these people have a right to know what God has said now I want to read something before we move on and I'll hurry I am hurrying this is me in hurry mode I God led me some years back to the writings of Wade Taylor and I never got to meet Wade in person before he passed away but I spoke with him several times on the phone and he reached out to me in email because he had been given a message that I had preached in Frederick Maryland by the way concerning the intimacy of the Bride and what we spoke about a few weeks ago just a little piece of that the the the tokens the proof the tokens of virginity the proof that the bride and the bridegroom have come together he heard that tape and he said I want to reach out to you and let you know the impact that that has had on me he was an author some of you know that he wrote a series of books all really powerful books this one is called The Secret of the stairs has anybody read it I've read it all the way through a few of you have read it the thing that I like about brother Wade Taylor's writings is it's filled with the scripture it's not just out on a limb somewhere it's so scriptural and he even had a devotional that's really really nice you might want to read that sometime look at that sometime but I want to read you two paragraphs from from the secret of the stairs he said the bride has made a major breakthrough the winter is past and the flowers are beginning to appear he goes on to Define what a spiritual winner is he said a spiritual winner is a time in which the Lord is seemingly absent let me ask you a question has anybody ever had a spiritual winner let me see your hand a time where it felt like the Lord was absent now how many of you know better than that Lo I'll be with you what always even when I don't see him he's working even when I don't feel him he's working even when I don't hear him he's working he's always working he's always moving in the lives of Believers but every one of us have had a spiritual winter in our life where it appeared that the Lord was absent that he hath would that he had withdrawn himself listen to this because I interrupted the quote he said a spiritual winner is the is a time in which the Lord is seemingly absent and we feel little are no quickening presence let's look at that a moment it's a time in our life when it feels like that the Lord is absent and we feel little or no quickening presence I like the fact that he didn't say no he said a little or no because I like to say as the old song wrote The Flame has flickered but it's never gone out I'd like to say that in my life there's never been a time that I knew that the Lord that I that I thought or felt like the Lord had left me for good but there have been many times I felt like he'd gone on a vacation and had left me to try to try to figure things out on my own and don't you look at me critically because you know exactly what that feels like and then 1997 when I went through the darkest trial of my life both both of physically and mentally and emotionally spiritually it even in that moment when I felt like there was really no a presence or no quickening power in my life I would sit on the porch and rock in a rocking chair feeling totally alone and singing or humming the song feeling nothing until I would think of the words of this song and begin to rock and sing some through the water some through the flood some through the fire but all through the blood God leads us your children along and I would feel that flame flicker I'd feel it I'd feel life again and as soon as I would get out from under that I would be by myself again it seemingly felt like so I like the way that Wade wrote it in that moment when it's seemingly that it feels like the Lord is absent and we feel little or no quickening presence he goes on to say the primary purpose of a winter season is to cause us to seek something further ah rather than remaining content with our past spiritual accomplishments can I read it again the primary purpose of a winter season is to cause us to seek something further rather than remaining content with our past spiritual accomplishments during this time of winter we may not be aware that the Lord is patiently waiting without but actively looking Within does that speak to anybody's heart are you reminded of a Time thought that he had left you but he's really just standing around you without but he is actively looking Within to see where there may be room that he might expand himself in US in our lives this winter I'm through with the quote this winner represents the time of spiritual barrenness that the bride experienced while content with the blessings and satisfaction she had received by knowing about the bridegroom apart from having a personal relationship with him you can recognize that your bride and he's bridegroom but that does not give you the relationship between a bride and a bridegroom to develop a relationship with him as your bridegroom King you have to actively participate in the process of the spirit what the holy spirit is trying to do in our life is to bring us into an active engaged relationship with the bridegroom King and winter is not a defeated time winter is a time of preparation you've got to have in Bible environment you've got to have winter because you got to have the rain let me tell you something I've been in Israel in the winter and I've been in Israel when the first rain came sister Alfreda was with me one time and Kathy from California was with us one time in in Israel when a first winter rain came and it the ground is so dry from the summer that the first rain never soaks it rushes like a sheet of water it never penetrates the ground you can Google videos of whaties that that Rush where the winter rain and every year washes out highways and usually cars and sometimes people because they're driving around down by the Dead Sea and the rain falls on the Judean Hills and it literally goes off the mountain in sheets of water down into the wadis and it builds a tidal wave you can see it of water there will not be a trickle of water coming through that Wadi not a trickle until that tidal wave of water that's come from the Judean Hills makes its way down toward the lowland of the Dead Sea it's Gathering all the time and getting lower and lower and lower and people be driving they don't hear it they don't even realize it's coming until it comes and it washes out asphalt and Highway and cars and people if they're in the way and empties itself into the Dead Sea that's how the spring rains come and it has to rain and rain and rain and I can hear Cynthia Clawson singing the song it won't rain always the sun will shine again things will change whatever you're walking through now it didn't come to stay yeah anybody with me it came to pass but you got to get through it you can't bypass kindergarten you can't bypass Junior High you've got to go every step lined upon line and precept upon precept it takes the rain it takes the winter season the almond tree is the first to bloom but it's the absolute last to produce fruit blooms first but makes its fruit later than any of the other trees in the land of Israel and yet when you're there for any period of time and and the first almonds Bloom it becomes news front page Jerusalem Post I'm I'm being serious the almond trees are blooming people Rejoice they go out to eat they make a party and they celebrate because they know that winter has come to an end and the rains are beginning to dry up and and and fruit is about to appear again olives are coming pomegranates are coming and figs are coming and dates are coming and it's time because they're still a people who eat from the land and who live very much off the land and especially the Citrus that that never grew in Israel until Israel was re-established as a nation and now it's one of the largest Citrus producing nations in anywhere across the world per capita of people which is prophecy being fulfilled and in order for that to happen that way there had to be every season it takes every season of life and every season of weather to get us to where we can have more than a head knowledge I'm bribed he's bridegroom we've got to have more than a head knowledge we've got to have a heart knowledge we've got to have a heart revelation there is a fast car on The Fast Track and it's a revelation of Jesus Christ come on now so if you're looking for an ordinary Church you better keep looking because we have not been called of God to be just another church on a list of churches but we've been called to be a forerunning people we're not out there by ourselves we're following the right track we're following the fast car we're on Pace and we recognize that it's the revelation of Jesus Christ that's changing us from glory to glory from Faith to Faith and the winner represents a time of barrenness and aloneness but it's also a time of rain we've got to have daytime and we have to have night time there's a time for it to be dark outside there's a time for it to be bright and to be light now in all of that in the time I have left in laying all of that out for you and I'm worn out already I want to pick up on one word and in order to do that I have to read the sentence again Wade Taylor said a spiritual winter is a Time in which the Lord is seemingly absent and we feel little or no quickening presence I want to look at that word quickening in Greek it means to make alive it's a spark of life it's it's an exciting exhilarating Witness of spirit that God is God and no matter how dark the winner has been are you with me no matter how dark the winter has been God's got something new something good something fresh in a new season did you know that the new birth itself is a quickening experience how many of you have had a new birth let me see your hand I've had a new birth the new birth is not just a birth it is a quickening it is an auction of spirit that causes us to pass from death into life that's right brother I want you to look at Ephesians 2 1. and be Amplified and I want you to read this out loud with me when we get it I want you to read it out loud with me are you ready and you he made alive when you were dead slain by your trespasses and sins and you he made alive you you can't even be born again without a quickening in your spirit how we want that quickening how we need that quickening and you've got to understand it's not a Feeling it's not the product of an emotion it's a work of the spirit when the spirit finds US dead in our trespasses and sins and he shocks us he quickens us it's like paddles on the chest do you know what I mean your your heart is out of rhythm you're going your heart is trying to stop or it has stopped and they say clear and everybody takes their hands off you doctors and nurses take their hands off of you and they put those paddles on your chest and electricity electric waves run through those wires and out those paddles and it's so potent that it lifts the body right up off the bed it's a shock it is hopes of reconnecting the electrical circuits of the body to cause the heart to beat again we must have the quickening power amen we've got to have it to be transformed from death our trespasses our sins and made new by the Resurrection Life of Jesus Christ so the new birth is not just a birth it is a quickening as we pass from Death unto life now folks I want you to come with me now I want you to listen to me I want you to stop making your notes and I want you to use your faith I want you to use your gift and I want you to pull like you know how to do for just a few moments because God wants to do something for us before we leave here today and if we're not careful we'll get we'll miss it we'll miss it we'll get caught up in detail and we'll miss what the Lord wants to do so I want you to stay with me as much as you possibly can right now I want you to reduce the moving around and I want you to put as much focus on the remainder of this service as you possibly can because I want the Lord to hook you and I up I want more than just a light quickening if winter is over then I want more of a quickening in my life than I have had in a long long time and I want that for you and God is building some things he's building some things this even the worship this morning Josh moving out of his comfort zone and David playing out of his comfort zone and everybody pulling there was just a moment there when we weren't working so hard to stay in Rhythm and beat and we just forget about all the the technical parts of what we're doing and you just let out a praise it just kind of um and I'm just smiling boy if you saw me you go back and look see if you see me on there I was just smiling I was just grinning like a mule eating Briars because you all were doing that nobody nobody prompting you nobody pushing you you are just doing that because you were under the inspiration of the atmosphere you may not know it but it's in a moment like that that he's turning up the jewels he's increasing that quickening life that he wants to use to transform us First John 3 14 in the Amplified says we know that we have passed over out of death into Life by the fact that we love the brethren our fellow Christians he who does not love abides remains is held and kept continually in spiritual death it's not what we say it's how often we're willing to go to war on somebody's behalf that's real love when you're willing to fight for their freedom when you're willing to fight for their survival when you're willing to fight to see them move ahead in the things of God brother that is love you know prayer is not a cop-out when somebody says I'll pray for you and they actually do that it's the most valuable thing that anybody could ever do for our life is to pray for us there's power in that there's quickening life in that who does not love abides remains is held and kept continually in spiritual death I want you to look at Romans 6 for just a moment I'm just going to give you scriptures here for for a few few minutes Romans 6 verse 3 through 5. are you ignorant of the fact that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized read it you were baptized into his death we were buried therefore with him by the baptism into death so that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glorious power quickening power of the father so we too might what is habitually to form a habit to form a habit so we too might form a habit to live and behave in what you can't do that in a spiritual winter but when winter comes to an end and God is calling you to a spring then what has only been a minor quickening in your spirit can now become so much more because spring is the message of Resurrection when you see the the the the flowers and the and the perennials that are dead that the winners kill them the cold has killed them the season has killed them and there's nothing left but a little pile of leaves there that have have just Fallen dead by the winter and all of a sudden you go out through the yard and you see those little shoots you take a hosta because they're so impressive and when they come they come you go out one day and it's about like that you go out the next day it's like that when they decide to burst forth they don't do it delicately they do it magnificently because spring is a message to all of us that there will be a winner and there will be death season and there will be dry season and there will be cold seasons in our life but spring is a testimony that Resurrection is coming and that new life is going to be on display this is why God's given us the seasons the way that he has in Romans 6 he goes on to say the next verse verse 5 for if we have become one with him by sharing a death like his we shall also be one with him in sharing his Resurrection by a new life lived for God he's talking about quickening life quickening life okay next is that it for if we have become one with him by sharing a debt is that verse 5. oh that is the last one thank you so much now second Corinthians 5 17 let's go there just a minute therefore if any person this is Amplified again if any person is engrafted in Christ the Messiah he is a new creation a new creature all together the old previous moral spiritual condition has passed away behold the flesh the fresh the fresh and new has come what is he talking about he's talking about quickening life quickening power that jolts Us From A Long Winter into the New Hope of a springtime thanks be to God now let's go to First Corinthians 15 for just a moment verse 45 through 47. and so it is written the first man Adam was made a living soul tell me how that happened God made him first Out of the Dust of the ground and he lay there a dead shell of a being and then God himself came with his own ruach his own ruach his breath and he breathed breath into the nostrils of man and that dead shell of a being with the addition of the Breath of God Adam became a living soul mind will and emotions a few seconds before just a shell no thinking ability he couldn't get up and walk he had no life he was made only in the image of God formed of the Dust of the Earth but it took the breath so that's the quickening the quickening that we need is the Breath of God to be breathed in us again what is it that caused the frozen ones to fall out to begin to stretch themselves into what God was calling them to what was it it was the breath it was the quickening life how did man receive it by the breath but look at this he said so it is written the first man Adam was made a living Soul the last Adam was made a oddly enough that word in the in the Greek is a word the the the the uh what do you call it the root of that word is is Zoe Z I started to say Zed and I'm not Canadian z-o-o it's like Zoo the last Adam was made a quickening Spirit the first Adam was made a living soul the second Adam the last Adam was made of what a quickening spirit now here's the explanation how be it that was not first which is spiritual what God did for Adam was Supernatural but it was a natural process God breeds Supernatural breath into him to give him his natural ability to feel to think to show emotion it didn't do anything for his spirit it made him a soul that was life but it was natural he said how be it that was not first which is spiritual but that was just natural and afterward that which is spiritual now look at verse 47 the first man is what of the earth Adam the word Adam the name Adam is Adam in Hebrew and it means Earth of the Earth from the Earth Adam from the earth the first man is of the earth Adam earthy the second man is the Lord From Heaven oh so you're not just a human being living on a planet to fulfill an Earthly purpose there is a part of you that is eternal that is the Breath of God in you has made you a quickening spirit our Lord became a quickening spirit so that what was inside of him could be inside of us isn't that what Pentecost was about isn't that what Resurrection was about there have been no Resurrection there would have been no Pentecost had there not been quickening life and quickening power to raise up the dead body of the last Adam then there would have been no ability for the spirit that was in him to now live on you it was the life in the blood and the life of that blood that fell on the believer and that's what's happened to us so we have an Earthly part we have a soul that is alive with a mind and with a will and with an emotion but who we really are is a spirit that has been made alive because he has breathed his own Resurrection spirit his own quickening power has been breathed into us now wouldn't the enemy like to keep you locked in a winner Eternal winter I don't even know how many winners I don't know how long Narnia had been frozen over how many a hundred year a hundred Winters wouldn't the enemy just like to lock you in a season of a hundred Winters but all it takes is for the lion to move is this too much is it too wild is it too Sensational is it too mystical for you to get this morning oh I hope not now if I if I had strength and you had time I'd just go into another section of this I'll try to do it Tuesday night but let me just give you this little little part here you see Adam held something in his hand in original creation he held the title deed for full Redemption For All Mankind he held it in his hand it was a sealed book to Adam but there's a people that have not just been made a living soul they've also been made a quickening spirit like their lord and the same quickening power that makes a bride a quickening spirit the same power the same Resurrection Life that causes the bride to move by a quickening spirit has come to unseal the book to get it back where it belongs to reveal the Mysteries thereof so that you and I can understand the full Plan of Redemption it's a mystery the church will never understand I'm just being honest it wasn't for the church alone she may get bits and pieces of it but it was for a bride it was for a people that the bridegroom longed to have relationship with is anybody with me I understand that some of you have been listening again and going through some of the transvisions I commend you for doing that because that's just as much a part of your DNA as anything that's been spoken here today if God gave us those Visions as a body he did it because he wants us to walk in the power let me tell you something you're not going through anything right now that a visitation from The Headstone I can't change you just drop him in the river you just set the quickening life of that headstone dropped where you're near where you're standing and it'll bring Revival to your life so that you line up with the word so that he come and cap so that he comes and caps you into the fullness of the stature of the perfect man which is the Lord Jesus Christ now you see Adam had the title deed but he listened to his wife here it gets quiet he listened to his woman and she listened to the serpent and God had to rescue that book he had to take it away from Adam you know that's one of the if you ever dig and I I did and I'd love to preach that right now but I don't have the strength to do it now and you don't have the time to sit and listen to it right now but you ever go through those sections those quotes and dig into that a little bit it's the saddest thing it's so sad to think about Adam made in the image and the likeness of God he was an amateur God little G walking around in the earth he had power to move mountains to move trees to name animals he had Supernatural power in fact he was he had Dominion authority over the whole earth and he held it under his arm the title deed if the enemy would have showed up in the garden in any other form and tried to talk Adam out of that book he would have never been successful because Adam although he didn't understand what he had he was holding the authority which is the title deed for Redemption for the whole earth which is not just Souls on the earth it's actually for the Earth itself I want you to know the dirt beneath your feet has fallen and God has already made a plan to redeem even the dirt that you're walking on this Plan of Redemption is bigger than just the life of man it's everything that Satan has perverted and contaminated and polluted with his lie every bit of it restored back my my my my God's good to us but Adam forfeited that and you tell me can someone tell me what happened to the book then recently I heard someone preaching in the message who said Satan got the book you I tell you what if he got it we're lost I don't know where anybody got an idea like that they didn't get it from the message if Satan would have got a hold of that book he would have absolutely perverted every purpose that God had within that book no where did the book go anybody remember it went back to the hands of the original owner it went right back into God's hands where it belonged and God knew all along what Adam was going to do and he knew he'd get the book back and he knew he would watch over that book until he began to reveal it to Daniel then he places that seal book in the arms of John and John gets to stand back and watch the lamb who was really the lion who was really the lamp who was really the lion wasn't he oh a voice said gotta go let me give you one quotation Sixth Seal this one it's 137. watch this carefully he said compare scriptures of this great event that we will see that this great secret or mystery that was under the Sixth Seal of the book of redemption now remember these are hidden mysteries and the sixth excuse me and the six seals all together is one great big book now we know it wasn't a book codex wasn't invented it was a scroll and brother Branham said just six Scrolls rolled together interesting language here I have hundreds brother Greeley saw some of it one time I have hundreds of quotations about the six seals and the Seven Seals that I study at least once a week I read through them because there is so much that we have never been able to get a hold of and really fully grasp but this is in the middle of the seals this is the Sixth Seal he's been teaching us on the seals he's been revealing it under the inspiration of the Angel of the Lord that would come and stand in his den room every day and teach him but he was to come and bring to the people and this is on the Sixth Seal and he's still saying and the six seals all together one great big book just six Scrolls rolled together and it unwinds the whole book of redemption that's how the whole earth was redeemed listen at the next paragraph that's the reason John wept because if no one could get that book all creation everything was gone he would just simply turn back to atoms and molecules and so forth and Cosmic light and not even be creation person nothing else cause Adam lost the rights of that book he forfeited it when he listened to his wife and she listened to Satan's reasonings instead of the word of God see it was forfeited did you know s battle Italy's Eve's battle do you know where the greatest battle ever fought started it started in her it started in her mind same battle Chuck said when you get to the last battle interesting when you get to the last spell you'll see how it's supposed to look in here so interesting to me it's fascinating to me now I gotta move in fact I need to close now you know why it was 20 Pages it's three three sermons let me just just pull up one verse here first Corinthians 15 22. for as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive Adam lost it Christ redeemed it do you see even that how many of you can see even that you have understanding of that what Redemption is for you you don't know what a blessing that is you don't know what a blessing that is churches are filled with with uh people today and Easter lilies on the altar in the Methodist Church they dye their eggs red so at least the children can see the blood of Jesus you know they've all got their traditions brother Branham talks about them putting their Easter lilies he says that's the spirit of Cain that's a pretty serious thing to say they bring their Easter lilies and they decorate the altar he said God doesn't want Easter lilies on the altar he wants you on the altar why don't you get that decoration off and put yourself up there that's what he's looking for so the churches are filled today and they go out I don't know what they'll do in the in the weather but they'll go out and they'll hide Easter eggs and the little children we'll go and pick up their Easter eggs and last night they they woke up mamas and daddies hid their baskets in their homes with all the little goodies in it and the kids woke up this morning and the children are told a lie that the Easter Bunny has hopped by in the night this is does this honestly think about what it sounds like when I was in Iceland and I read the stories of their uh uh uh I can't think of what it's called right now but uh the stories that they make up about about their Origins and their traditions and whatever you call it they've got the most hideous thing uh on Christmas they don't have a Santa Claus they've got a witch and the witch has children and they're the most hideous looking little imps you've ever seen in your life and the children put their put their shoes out and the witch comes by and puts gifts in their shoes and the little children how many of you think that just sounds uh outlandish let me see your hand doesn't that just sound just the weirdest thing you've ever heard in your life little children and they they make they make books and pictures and they show the witch looking in at the little children to see hideous looking creature looking in at the little children my goodness the little kids are afraid to go out they put the shoes out and lock the door they go to bed and hope they don't wake up in the night with a witch standing over their bed you know craziness well does that sound more Outland then a bunny hopping by one who lays eggs somebody don't know very much about how bunnies are born they don't hatch out of eggs so the whole world today and guess what they eat you know what they eat ham one day out of the year they make their ham dinner you ought to look at that that is as Pagan As It Gets they're they're taking they're taking revenge on the boar that killed was it nimrod it was one of the one of the figures in the story tamus killed by a wild boar that's right and so they everybody started eating traditionally ham to take revenge on the boar and that's so normal and you and I gathered here talking about Adam losing the title deed of redemption and God restoring that back into the hands of a bride who will minister in authority and Power in the last days to know that instead of thinking I have to eat ham today or instead of teaching my children or grandchildren that the bunny dropped off some presents for them in the night I have the grace of being able to pass down to my children that we have been restored all the way back to God's original thoughts about his people brother we don't know how blessed we really are we take this for granted can anybody just say Amen we take this for granted I'm closing musicians are coming what a hodgepodge I want to read just one because I I can't help but think about Resurrection can help but think about him First Corinthians 15 17 says if Christ be not raised your faith is vain ye are yet in your sins did you know that the apostles said that the death in itself was not enough to reveal to you who you are you had to have more than a revelation of the death you also had to have an impartation of his resurrection live or you can't understand the new birth because the death is not what gives you quickening power it's the resurrection it's the resurrection how do we know that because the Bible tells us the scripture tells us in Romans chapter 8 verse 11 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you you've got quickening power you've got quickening life in here isn't that wonderful to know to give you this last it's in the message I'm sorry for jumping around that's not the name of the message but I'm sorry for jumping around it's in the message and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies Long Beach California let's read this then when he died down at the cross hell taken his precious soul the Bible said his soul descended into hell that's exactly right hell captured his soul and took him down there how many of you think that probably wasn't a real good move because while he was down there he did business Hallelujah [Music] the prophet said but brother on that third day he possessed the gates of death hell and Grave and Rose up the third day and look at the next phrase and overcome it all what he took sickness the grave and everything I believe he jerked the gate Plumb off the hinges of them and took them Out rose on how scripture said he ascended on high and did what he gave gifts unto men that's the Ascension gifts the gifts that could only come down if he went up and what were those gifts that could only come down if he went up not tongues interpretation tongues prophecy Ascension gifts Apostle Prophet Pastor teacher and evangelist got to have them he said I believe he jerked the gate Plumb off the hinges of them and took them out rose on high ascended on high and tonight you are more Hallelujah you are more than conquerors his seed shall possess the gates of the enemy yes sir he possessed

race from the dead possessed the gate go back to this quote from C.S Lewis wrong will be right when Ashland comes in sight at the sound of his Roar Sorrows will be no more when he Bears his teeth somebody get me the quote somebody look up on your phone and get me the quote about about Lucy when that when I want to read this about the lion about him being oh my anybody know what I'm talking
