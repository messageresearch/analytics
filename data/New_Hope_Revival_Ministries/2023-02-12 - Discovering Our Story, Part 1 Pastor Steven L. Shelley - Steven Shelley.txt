this service we remember your needs today believe in the Lord to minister to you we want to remember Sister Alfreda she's going to be leaving us for an extended period of time this week when I ask the Lord to give her safe travels I know the Shelley family is leaving us for some time away and we want to ask the Lord to let that be a a fruitful time a renewing time a healing time for them would you remember my wife too and and Olivia both they're sick and both of them treated being treated for something in the lungs uh bacterial something in the lungs we want the Lord to heal them and gingers

this life make any sense is you and I was just thinking Lord as we were worshiping about Resurrection live when we truly understand laying down our own life so you can come and Resurrect The True Life it's only in that place where we will find life is by laying down our own soul life times it just takes a lot to get to this place but I ask you for Grace where we can surrender and you can come and live within us your life your purpose Lord I pray for sister Stacy sister Olivia Ginger anyone the Lord that is fighting something in their bodies we speak to that sickness in the name of the Lord Jesus and we command it to go and we'd ask in the name of Jesus for Speed and recovery and Restoration in the body and those that are traveling we just ask for mercy and Grace let your perfect plan unfold maybe something accomplished in the spirit as people are leaving you have an appointment with some and I just ask that your perfect plan would unfold Lord I'm believing that for the supernatural there's something crying out for more for more for more for more of you adventures in God Sons of sons of God accomplishing the perfect will of the father and you're accompanying them with signs and wonders but the the biggest miracle miracle of all we're gonna love like you we're gonna love each other we're going to love one another that is the most Supernatural thing I can think

you can be seated you've been standing a long time you can be seated you know I I'm not going to apologize for taking so much time to sing about the blood I don't know where you'd be I don't know where I would be without the blood of Jesus but something tells me I wouldn't be here I don't know where I'd be I might be in hell I don't know where I'd be now if I had not found the blood the blood found me and I'm so thankful for the very life that is in the blood we're saved by grace not of Works lest any man should boast you can't dress right enough you can't even live right enough the best day you've had the best day you've ever lived the closest Day you've ever lived of the Lord wouldn't be enough it's only because of his grace it's only because of the life that's in his blood and it's only because he opened our eyes he anointed our eyes with I Salve or we would be just as lost as the rest of the Jay birds around us just lost not knowing where they're going you'd be right among them I'd be right among them if it had not been for the Lord if he hadn't found us the way he did I'm so thankful to know that every one of my days are written in his book I'm so glad to know that Satan can't kill me I can't leave this earth until the Lord calls me and when he calls me I'm out of here and if I don't have time to say goodbye don't worry I'll see you on the other side I feel the same toward you we don't ever know when we've hugged our one another's neck for the last time I don't want to get morbid I just want to be honest we don't ever know when we say goodbye I'll see you later see you after a while crocodile or whatever you say we don't ever know whether it be on this side or the other side but if you'll do like brother Greeley said this morning and you'll live with no dead cats on the line let me tell you something my grandmother always gave this testimony when my aunt was just a little bitty girl not even a teenager and she fell dead at her feet with the rheumatic fever her heart stopped that's one of the things that rheumatic fever did it would stop the heart and she fell dead at my grandmother's feet my grandmother said I started to think of things I ought to I might ought to pray about but but she said honestly I had I had prayed I had cleared it all up with the Lord and so she said all I knew to say was I'll go where you want me to go I'll do what you want me to do I'll say what you want me to say I'll be what you want me to be if you won't take my baby girl and God gave her back to my grandmother I said granny was there not anything you needed to make right she said if there was it didn't come to my mind she said because I didn't wait till I got in trouble to pray about it so let us give you that advice again don't wait until it's too late or until you need to call on him for Mercy or help Josiah could have left here he certainly could have he had an accident this week and he he's let you know that already and the and we've prayed for him and he's doing good looking pretty good and uh that could have easily been another way sure could have wouldn't that have been a sad day for us today if he would have left us but you know the Lord had a different plan and even the enemy couldn't take him until God got ready to call him so you know we've got Blessed assurance Blessed Assurance this morning once you dedicate your life to the Lord he'll take care of the rest of it if you'll just say yes sir I know there's a lot of preaching out there about the devil killing people and and the government killing people in the hospital killing people and I hear people say all kinds of things well all you have to do is know you're born again of the spirit filled with the Holy Ghost Sanctified holy and holy Sanctified baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there's no other baptism baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then it doesn't matter what comes your way God will let you be the only Survivor on the Jet Plane if he's not through with you [Music] you'll be the only one to get a mock out of there amen I don't know if you're convinced or not but I'm living my life this way I'm convinced I want to just say to you today we're very happy to have you here and that is the best looking back row over there on that side that's the best looking back row I've ever seen in my life to see that beautiful family sitting there [Applause] you all look amazing to me today and I'm not one that just flatters but you do you're just a field an empty Pew that needed to be filled with you today thank you all for being here

on I Didn't Know I Was prophesying how many years 24 wow 24 years I was there [Applause] God is good thank you musicians thank you everyone for helping us let's thank God for the gifts in their life now we've got to turn to the word let's stand I appreciate you honoring God's word we're going to read the word and then let you sit down again and uh we know that God is going to do great things for you over the course of the next few weeks we know that God is going to mightily use brother Greeley to minister to you over the next two Sundays we know that God's going to speak and we know that you're going to be blessed and helped and when I join you again on the first two weekends of March I know that would be uh I believe March the 5th and the 12th I know that you're going to be stronger with more Victory with more joy stronger in the word than you are this morning I completely impeccably 100 percent without reservation endorse and Trust brother Greeley's Ministry and you are going to be blessed we have years of track record together someone said if you all ever disagreed we have but when you are brothers you disagree in the backyard and you come to the front yard and embrace one another and God has helped us to do that all through the years he is that kind of a man you're sitting in a building response so he is responsible for helping it be here God used him to put this together we are blessed and have been blessed for many years I read this week that a sabbatical a true sabbatical can last anywhere from three months to a year and so I am just feeling very good about my few weeks away I don't think I quite need it but you never know what might happen but my I'm just kidding oh I'm just kidding Psalms 139 let's go there together also let me mention that we will have a fellowship weekend here Saturday night April the 1st at six o'clock Sunday morning April the 2nd at 11 o'clock that will be our next Fellowship weekend and hopefully the weather will be nice and we can have at least under the small tents or whatever we can get arranged maybe we can have a picnic together that Sunday some of our out of town streamers perhaps can come and be with us again and let's see what the Lord will do amen we've still got some time to be together between now and then Psalm 139 verse 16 thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them how precious also are thy thoughts unto me o God How great is the sum of them if I should count them think about this if I should count them they are more in number than the sand what is he talking about the Lord's thoughts toward us if I should count them they are more in number than the sand when I awake I am still with thee now while you're standing let me read 16 through 18 in the complete Jewish Bible translated by Dr David Stern your eyes could see me as an embryo but in your book all my days were already written my days had been shaped before any of them existed God how I prize your thoughts how many of them there are if I count them there are more than grains of sand if I finish the count I am still with you does that bring encouragement to anybody's heart like it does mine he is constantly thinking about his children his people his sons let's bow our heads for just a moment father we thank you today for this Gathering Together your wonderful presence that has been in our midst we thank you for every song of worship for every praise for every demonstration of the moving of your spirit I want to thank you again in the presence of this people for letting us be gathered together not only in spirit but in spirit and in truth there could be no monetary value affixed to the great privilege you have given us to meet together not only in spirit but in truth Lord truth is not a Doctrine it's not a sermon it's not even a message but truth is a person you are the truth Jesus you are the way you are the life and so I thank you today that you are letting us Gather in spirit and in truth and now as we approach your word Open the Eyes of our understanding anoint them with I salve that we might see the purity of the truth of your word transform us from our Vain and vile image into your own image so that your own life and Light May shine out of us in the darkest hour the world is seemingly ever known come to us today Lord and help us in our time in your word and we will give you praise and honor and glory for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and the Saints said you may be seated I want to spend our time together in the word today looking at the subject discovering our story if I would give it a subtitle I would call it discovering our destiny but when we talk about history we sometimes say history is his story his story when we look at God's word when we perceive where God has been what God has done when we Mark the anniversaries in our life of times that we have met with God we discover where his story and our story intertwined aren't you glad aren't you glad that your life and his life are connected at various points along the way and even when we don't perceive that we are indeed connected with him when we surrender Our Lives to him we quit living our life stay with me we quit living our life and we start living his life the apostles said the life that I now live is not my own I'm living the Christ life I'm living the exchanged life I've laid my life down as brother Hawk prayed today I've laid my life down and I've picked up another life Another Life Source if you will I have surrendered my will and I have taken up the cause of his will if you're living after your own will you haven't reached the end of the Hard Knocks if you're living after your own desire and not inquiring of the Lord concerning his desire for your life your troubles aren't nearly over in fact I submit to you that they may be complicated as you go along it's only when you allow the Lord's life to to be the reason for your living you can't live for your wife you can't live for your husband you can't live for your children you can't live for your job you can't live for your hobby for your home for a newer automobile you can only you can't live to make another dollar the only reason why a true Son of God can live is to please the Lord and in doing so He blesses us with healing for our body with strength for the journey with favor and blessing as sister Flo testified when she was singing and when we refuse to accept the Lord's will and we continue to struggle for our own way we're going to find our life harder than it really has to be I'm going to ask you this morning in all honesty is there someone here that would say I know I've made my way hard by fighting for my own will anybody I'm not looking too much but I think most of us could say yeah there are times that I made a harder path for myself because I was so hard-headed just a minute come on preacher talk to us I was so hard-handed so stubborn willed so set in my mind set in my ways that I could not accept anything but how I wanted to see it done or how I wanted to see it happen you know sometimes it's because we get tired of waiting on the Lord he doesn't move as fast as we want him to move sometime but it's like we talked about last Sunday he may not come when you want him but he's right on time he never misses an appointment with his children he never never leaves us too long to feel like we're alone if you call on Jesus sister Megan was singing This Morning When I Call On Jesus doesn't matter how dark it is how Bleak it is how hopeless it is how ugly it is When I Call On Jesus hope returns When I Call On Jesus strength comes back to my life When I Call On Jesus I feel more resilience more determination encouraged to stand the word encourage means to have our courage renewed how many of you have ever felt the Lord renew your courage he just comes to us he strengthens us by his presence he doesn't even have to talk to us to strengthen us Lord just let me get where you are just let me come into the atmosphere of your glory like we've been in this morning you ready to help me preach get in that Glory presence and see what God will do he'll change a heart he'll change your mind he'll change a stubborn will my old great aunt used to sing a song about God changing my stubborn will you opened up my eyes change my stubborn will then it said I I can't be still oh here's how it went it said I can't be still my heart would chill since I have found the Blessed Lord and he changed my stubborn will how many of you have ever had a change of your stubborn will in in a book s of Destiny I believe it is I have a quotation here that I would like to read to you because I find it to be beautiful you said many biblical Scholars have difficulty with this but I believe in Eve is precisely what it says I kind of like theologians that will leave the Bible at the Bible don't you he said our God is Sovereign and infinite he is not bound by the limitations of time he can foresee every thought every decision and every action that shall ever be made I want to read it again have fought he knows what you're thinking and he knows what you're going to think that's a big God you talk about a mind reader that's a big God one that not only knows what I thought or what I'm thinking now but he knows the next thought that I'm I'm about to have he knows what I'm going to be thinking when I get up in the morning he knows who knows one to be thinking I go to bed tomorrow night he has the ability to foresee to know and to discern all of my thoughts from that Eternal posture he is able to record in the journals of Heaven all the days of our individual lives and he can and has done this before we were ever formed in our mother's womb I want to know who believes that I mean I want to know who believes that in here this morning and you chose what what shirt to put on you did it by a thought and you sisters chose what dress to put on or what shirt blouse to put on what shoes to go with your outfit you did it by a thought if that's true and if the Lord knows every thought and before new and pre-new every thought it means that he recorded your outfit wow Lord have mercy this could be revolutionary for some of you sisters now my wife I'm going to talk about her today because I'm fixing a carrier off and wine and diner for it not real wine you know that I'm gonna give her a grape soda or something and take her off for a little holiday here well deserved holiday so I'm gonna have to preach about her just a little bit so if you feel it getting tight in here you'll know what it's all about when I leave on Sunday morning my wife has owned an outfit a lot of the time not today honey not today well there's a new day of dawning she said not today when I leave my wife's already got her outfit on it's very rare for me to see her at church in the same outfit when I go home on Sunday I know she's the only one in here honey you don't have to worry I can preach the sister beverages I understand sister Beth said I sure can too when I come home on Sunday afternoon sometime there is a pile on her side of the bed I don't even ask on occasion I'll go through the house and I'll say honey you had a hard time with your outfit today didn't you she said I sure did but I'll pick up every one of them and I'll hang every one of them back up so I don't ask anymore if if we could just discover that God already knows what the last one is going to be if we had some way of tapping into that thought and just starting out with what the Lord wants in everything I'm not trying to be silly I'm trying to use that as an example how how much more stress-free could our life be if we recognize that God has a plan and a thought about everything that pertains to you he already knows what you're going to decide for dinner let me read it because some of you are looking at me a little bit odd let me read it in the complete Jewish Bible again your eyes could see me as an embryo unformed substance King James says but in your book of days [Music] well don't I have a choice did God not give me a choice he gave you lots of choices he just knows what your choice is going to be because he's a god of foreknowledge he already knows what you're going to choose and he's already written it down you're here today because before the foundation of the world the lord saw that it's someplace in your life you were going to choose to serve him he not only knew where you were going to choose he knew where you were going to end up how many of you have attended regularly more than five churches in your Christian journey I haven't but I know many have you have Faithfully attended more than five churches for periods of time along the way let me see your hand that's that's quite a few of us I can't say that about myself but I know that's many of your story did you know God knew every one of them he knew that in every place you were going to be a sign you were going to pick up some truth help me now you were going to pick up some things that were going to strengthen you and help you and bless you and teach you but he also knew just like you when you let me ask you this when you when you have you ever been in a church and once you got there you just knew in your nowhere this is it let me see your hand all right now many of you say you know that let me ask you this did any of you ever find out later that it wasn't the case let me see your hand I thought I had found my one and only last Church on the Earth but I realize that's not the case let me see Anne come on I need some audience participation this morning well how come you felt like that was the last one because at the time it was meeting all of your needs and you couldn't ever see a transition that would cause you to be uprooted from where you had found such broad places to live in but God already knew then that wasn't your last place he knows that some of you today may not have found your last place I don't know that but he knows that and every one of those places he had somebody there at the right time to give you something you needed to help you get on the way and my advice to you is don't bash where you come from thank God for where you come from you wouldn't be wouldn't be had you not been through some stuff amen but praise God that you don't have to be in that anymore Lord thank you that the pillar of fire keeps moving along Lord thank you that Holy Ghost leadership doesn't die he continues to lead us he continues to draw us to closer places in him because he knows every one of our days oh my God he knows all of our children before they're born come on he knows the ones that we will not be able to nourish till their till the end of their life we know in our minds that it is never right it never feels right for a mother or a dad to have to bury a child and yet there are people in this room who have had to bury children along the way I'm sure there have been times that they have asked themselves the question why why am I still here why am I 80 something years old still on the planet and and my daughter for instance sister flow my daughter taken at such a young age we may have these questions but let me tell you something one day one day you're going to know every reason why I doubt you'll ever have to ask him I know there's beautiful songs written about talking it over with him and asking him the reasons and he'll tell us the why but I doubt you'll ever have to ask him I have a feeling that when we get to Eternity with him we'll know even as we are known every secret every mystery every question everything that we desire to understand on Earth but just couldn't somehow get our minds around it I have to have this Faith to believe that we will know and it'll give us so much confidence and so much peace throughout all eternity oh isn't that a wonderful thing it's a wonderful thing to know that God's got it all under control do you ever find a job and you thought it'd be your last job you'd never be looking for another job next thing you know your job hunting God saw that transition he saw that change do you ever have a relationship with somebody a boyfriend girlfriend I hate to say husband or wife but it's true for some of us and you thought this is it this will last forever and things didn't turn out you see God's not just writing his will down he's writing everything he knows about us understand he's writing everything he knows it's foreknowledge it's not forced service we understand without spending much time in it today that God has a perfect will and he has a permissive will it's outlined for us both in the Bible and in the message we also know there's a book of life where every deed of every man who ever lived on the planet has at least at one time been recorded and then there is a Lamb's Book of Life brother Branham talks about a transfer taking place from one book to another but when we search the scripture we understand that every name that was ever going to be written in that Lamb's Book of Life was recorded there before the foundation of the world these are they whose names were found written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world we understand from the scripture and the message that once your name is in the Lamb's Book of Life it can never be blotted out the only book that your name can come out of is The Book of Life and if your name comes out of the Book of Life the Bible tells us it is as though you never existed on the earth and it is indeed a great punishment for those who reject and refuse the salvation and the grace that the Lord has offered to them in this life it's a sad thing to think about you don't have any time to focus on fulfilling somebody else's dreams somebody said my mama always dreamed to do such and such and such and she's not here anymore and I'm going to pick up her dreams and I'm gonna go fulfill her dream I wouldn't get on that road if I were you that's not a gerbil will I would find myself on if I were you you 've done and doing what he has we don't have time to pick up somebody else's dream or burden or Vision or thought we better just pick up and find out what the Lord has already written about us in his book of our days every one of them my days have been shaped before any of them existed God how I prize your thoughts how many of them there are if I count them there are more than grains of sand if I finish the count I am still with you I want you to know we think about God's promise to Abraham I'm going to make your seed as numerous as the Sands of the seashore we think that is a number that could not hardly be calculated how many sands how many grains of sand are on the seashores of the world it seems to me like a a number that cannot be calculated and yet God says through the psalmist here it confirms it by the spirit that his thoughts toward you are as numerous as the Sands of the sea tens of thousands of millions of billions of trillions of thoughts he's had about you how could it be how could it be that in your short years here on life that God could have thought billions of thoughts about you that's how much he loves you somebody said I don't believe that then you're rejecting what the word said all my days all my all your thoughts toward me they're innumerable they if I should get to the ends of the grains of sand I should never still finish all the things that you have thought about me that you have known about me you knew every decision before I ever made it you knew the consequences of every decision you knew the years that I would sometimes waste spinning my wheels because I had made a bad choice and I had sought to do my own will and not your will I want you to know today every bit of that can be redeemed I want to say that very carefully again again you are not just a church member out there somewhere you are a part of the elected predestinated seed of Jesus Christ and because of that nothing about you nothing concerning you is unredeemable he can redeem every thought that he ever had toward you no matter what a mess I made no matter what a mess you made no matter how we really really really got off course he can redeem every year I need help he can redeem every month he can redeem every hour you see every child of God has a book written about him or her God saw us in our fleshly form in the earth before we ever existed he saw our days he saw it all including our choices and decisions he knew then about our abilities our strengths he knew our gifts even then before the foundation of the world he knew that some would be able to sing and it would be somewhat melodious and others would sing barely carrying a tune in a bucket he already knew that he knew that some would set out to learn the guitar and three weeks later would give up and never learn to play but he knew there would be some that would love it with a passion and they wouldn't only learn to play it they would learn to teach others to play it and they would not only do it with skill they would do it with anointing he knew that 90 of the population would say at one point or another I would like to play the piano anybody in this room ever said I'd like to play the piano or the keyboard hold your hand up it's 90 percent of the world's population by the way even people that have never seen a piano except on the video have said I'd like to play that but how many of you know the proof is in the pursuit do you really want to play it if you really wanted to play it you'd stick it out you'd take a lesson or two did you know God knew that everybody who said I want to learn to play the piano wouldn't learn but he knew there would be some that would learn he knew there are some that would be gifted in it he knew there would be some you had to beg them put Dynamite under them to get him up to play the piano he knew there would be others so confident in what God had given them that you'd never have to beg them to play that even in the times that they didn't feel good or feel like it they would still give that gift back to God because it was what they were created to do and they would teach other people to do it he would know that tens of thousands of millions of people would desire to preach and some of them wouldn't make it past the first 45 days he knew that there would be others who would receive a call even at an early age in their life or a late age as a second call a second vocation and that they would be faithful to that call to the last day that they would live on the earth he knew that he knew that some would get married and nine months later would have a baby without any problem he knew there would be others that would wait a year two years three years four years five years six years seven years eight years nine years ten years trying to have a baby like brother and sister West 10 years of waiting hoping believing to have a baby God knew that he knew that Stacy and I would marry and nine months later we would have a baby but he knew that brother and sister Wes 10 years into their marriage would still finally finally at 10 years be expecting a baby there was a journey there was something set in there there was a servant of God who had to have a part of their story God's got some characters in your story that you've not yet met he's got some you've dodged in Walmart but you're going to meet him again because they're part of your story some are strange you run the other way God's going to run them your way before it's over you're gonna have to be the one that God uses to speak into their life let me tell you something you can run from a lot of things but you're not going to run from God's thoughts toward you he's got them wrote down he'll bring you back around brother and sister Wes wanted to have a baby her daddy was a pastor his dad was a preacher they were ministers they were in the Assemblies of God they loved the Lord with all their heart they recognized in the 1950s that God had sent a prophet who was operating in a wonderful anointing with a very high call from the Lord and was having healing meetings that were unprecedented in many many ways they would go to some of those meetings brother Benny West's dad would befriend this man through his dad excuse me Benny West would get to know brother Branham through his dad knowing brother Branham they would share meals together they would drive from from Huntsville or from the northern part of Alabama all the way to Jeffersonville Indiana a weekend after weekend after weekend to hear the word to see the Miracles to be a part of what God was doing in those days before there were highways before there were interstates they had a desire a drawing a knowing and because of that a relationship developed and brother Benny West's daddy said to brother Branham my my son and his wife would like to have a child if you just pray for them if you get a chance maybe you just pray for them they're in the meetings in North Carolina going somewhere between I can't remember what the first meetings were but three Pines was one of the places that they were going it's in those North Carolina Spindale maybe it's one of those uh North Carolina meetings that he did back to back they're getting in they're getting out of the motel room checking out one morning and uh at the same time that brother Brandon is checking out he walks over to the car where they're about to get in the car and he says to them so I understand that you all would like to have children yes sir we would like to have children he says to brother Betty West slide over and brother Branham sits behind the driver's seat of their own automobile brother West is in the middle he has had him to slide over sister West is is on the other side they're sitting there brother Brandon begins to talk to them about how wonderful it is to desire children and how when you have children you ought to raise them in church you ought to get them in Sunday school you ought to teach them the things of the Lord and they readily agree both of them being raised in Christian homes sister West being the daughter of a pastor they had no problem with those beautiful words of encouragement that brother Branham was giving to them he begins to to go off a little bit in Vision it seems and he touched the windshield wiper and he says what is this brother Branham brother West begins to explain to brother Branham it's the windshield wiper brother banham looks at him and he says you know why I'm doing that don't you and brother West shakes his head we all know now that brother West didn't really have a clue until later and always kidded him about it I say you can't lie to a prophet he knew when he asked you you didn't have a clue what he was doing but he also knew that one day you'd figure it out because when I got the story many years later brother I said I know now that he was going into vision and he would do things like that he told us to break the vision so that it didn't take a toll on his body because he was going to the next meeting so brother random again he he looks at them and maybe says some little prayer doesn't make any prophecy or prediction except for this when you have children remember raise them in church and get them in Sunday school and that's just about the end of it by the way I said I can't remember a prayer maybe there's a little prayer I can't remember what he said don't remember the amen not sure what happened after that but he remembered when brother Branham got out of the vehicle they remembered that brother Branham said when you have children God saw that from the beginning ten years into their marriage and this encounter that they had with the prophet of God God saw all of that before the foundation of the world and whatever was preventing them from having a child it was lifted but it couldn't be lifted until that experienced that that was a play that was what what the prophet called The Junction in time I know this is too much for some I'm not preaching to you I'm preaching to the others this was a junction in time the because God and our lives have come together at Junctions and all we can say is blessed be the name of the Lord some of those Junctions were painful some of them were Grievous some of them drove us almost insane but every one of them were necessary because before the foundation of the world God had thoughts toward us he knew what we were going to think he knew what we were going to say he knew what we were going to do and the outcome had been written every one of our days written written written written written written there's two fellas in the church this morning one of them came to me last Sunday afternoon I was it must have been six o'clock I was still in church clothes I had not even got to go home yet to change clothes I'm at the back of my vehicle and one of the Two Fellas walks up to me right out there and says so and so and I have been smoking brisket isn't that terrible isn't that awful who would do that to their pastor no pipes involved no joints involved just smoke and Heavenly brisket so I said I'm so Disturbed I can't hear the rest of what you've got to say but somehow I broke myself out of my nervous condition and found out that they wanted to prepare a meal for us and we got to go and have that meal and I want you to know it was not to heaven not to heaven I thought about it every single day since then I thought about those few little strips of brisket that was left there laying in the bowl and one of the brothers said went on brother Shelley you know if you wanted to take that you could take it dum dum dum me I said no brother it's expensive brisk is expensive I know you all paid a lot for that and you all would probably enjoy that and eat that I've seen it laying in the bowl everything I've eaten since then I thought sure would be good with a slab of that brisket I am so far out with what I believe that I believe that every part of that was for a reason not just to fill my belly with good brisket I believe there was a reason we were gathered together the way we were and everybody in the room that was supposed to be in the room was in the room and I believe that even in our fellowship together we were accomplishing something I can't say for sure what it was but I love the feeling of going to bed at night and knowing that I have been today where God wanted me to be I want you and I to have a desire like never before to be in the will of God to know the will of God for our lives to discover not what he will permit us to do but what he would prefer for us to do I believe the Lord saw me as a little boy living near near Brunswick Georgia Saint Simon's Island I believe God saw the misery in my life as I went to bed every night and heard my mother beat nearly to a pope I believe God saw my heart's desire as I stood at the window on Sunday morning and saw the little children getting on the Assembly of God's Church bus to go to Sunday school and I beg my mother and my stepfather to let me go to church with all the other children but my my stepfather had been raised in a Pentecostal foster home and had been terribly physically abused there he didn't want anything to do with Pentecost he said maybe if I found a Baptist Church he would let me go but he didn't want me to go to a Pentecostal church I stood Sunday after Sunday with tears running down my face begging the Lord to make a way that I could go to church and worship him whenever I wanted to go now let me tell you something what did that do for you I make sure that I'm in church you look back over the years of my life and I want to be where God's people are gathered together in his name I want to be there when the doors are open if I possibly can that's where I want to be because there was a time I didn't have a choice but as soon as I got my choice I wanted I don't want to be a once a month Christian I don't want to be a once every six month Christian I want to be where God would have me to be every day of my life and I'm encouraging you today I'm encouraging you to have the same desire now I know only the Lord can put that in us only the Lord can pour oil on that in our lives but I beg you in the name of the Lord do not settle for what he will permit discover what he prefers you have to work a job that's junk job until you can get to the place where God puts you in the job that he has for you you do that but don't you give up on what God has if God's put it in your heart to build a business don't you give up on that because it gets difficult don't you give up on that because it looks hard you keep holding on you provide for your family with whatever honest work you can get but don't you give up because the desire for it may be it may be an unsanctified part of Who You Are could be it could be an unsanctified part of who you are that wants to make money doing nothing hello could be could be or it might be a god-breathed desire that he is anybody with me seems a little scattered but I'm doing what I can that's all I can do is what I can it seems to me like somehow it could possibly be that the Lord has breathed that desire in you so do you want to spend all the days of your life working for someone else if God has breathed in you the inspiration and the desire to do something where you have your own hours if you're looking let me just tell you this though just out of common sense if you're looking to build a business so you can work two days a week you better keep the job you got in fact you better Moonlight at the donut shop because that's not how you build a business let me tell you something there's years of hard work sometime that go in and lean times and pray in times there are times that put you on your knees and that's all right too because God knows what it takes to get us in desperation before him but don't you let somebody discourage you when you know that you've picked up on an inspiration from the Lord and if you've waited two years or three years for the youngins or four years for the youngin or five years for don't you dare accept anything less than what God knew about you he even knew our weaknesses you're still here these thoughts were then recorded in the Heavenly record I want to read it again he saw it all including our choices decisions he knew our abilities strengths gifts and even our weaknesses these thoughts were then recorded in the Heavenly record the destiny and Kingdom Purpose for each of Our Lives was written long before we were ever born not just the number of them but he saw the activities in them and he saw what we would accomplish in our lives our individual book is a written record of all which God planned for us and the kingdom impact that he has destined for each of Our Lives there's a battle going on and the battle is to get whatever is in the book about your life to manifest here on the Earth want to say it again there's a battle going on and that battle is to get everything written of you in God's book to come to pass at your destiny that's his plan that's his will and we're battling to get that to come to pass here on the earth and let me tell you something the way we battle for our destiny is not with guns the way we battle for our destiny is with tears it's with prayer it's with fasting it's with seeking the Lord that is how we find and discover God's will for our life it's by going to him by sitting in his presence by basking in his love that's how we discover what God has for us in the message Dr Moses would you show us that paragraph 34 of the message Dr Moses he said in the mind of God Christ was already crucified before Christ was born before the second temple period Christ was already crucified in the mind of God if you believe that's amen for he was the lamb slain from the foundation of the world he said back in Eden watch this Christ in God's thoughts which became his word had not yet materialized I want to make sure you catch that it means that Christ was crucified before he ever materialized he wasn't even born and yet in the mind of his father in the mind of gods he was already what crucified Christ in God's thoughts which became his word had not yet materialized but he knew what it was for he had promised it and he let the children of Israel listen and he let the children of Israel draw interest thank you who's ever heard of this kind of economics this is not the economics of the First National Bank this is the economics of the kingdom of God the children of Israel were already drawing benefits from a crucifixion that had not even taken place from a savior who had not yet been born but had already died in the mind of God how is that possible because that's who he is that's how big your God is you don't think he can help you with your problem you don't think he can help you with your broken toe you don't think he can help you with your migraine you don't think he can see you through your cold or your cough you don't think God can get you through that but yet he can let the children of Israel become beneficiaries and withdraw from a deposit that had not yet even been made they were blessed because of a future installment of God's grace toward mankind they got healing under a lesser Covenant that was promised to those of a greater Covenant they kept they looked upon a brass Serpent and they received the Divine Healing of the cross that had not yet even taken place there had not yet even been a cross you know what that says to me it says God's had it under control since the beginning of time he's never lost a case now here's something we have to remember even Jesus had a destiny that was already chosen for him by his father it was recorded before he came into the Earth to fulfill the plan if you believe that same man look at Hebrews chapter 10. verse 5 through 9. you're still here wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offering thou what is not but a body hast thou prepared me and burn offerings and sacrifices for sin has had no pleasure then said I lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will oh God this comes from Messianic Prophecy of the older Covenant here's the Apostle Paul pulling from that older Covenant and helping the Hebrew Believers to understand that even our Lord Jesus Christ 100 God 100 man was still on the earth and every day of his life here on the earth he was living out the volume of the book that had been written about him that's powerful it speaks of the sovereignty of God it speaks of the obedience to the commission and it speaks to every battle that our Lord went through the Bible said though he were a son yet learned he obedience what by the things he suffered and though he was tempted in all like manner as we are what did the Bible say about his overcoming power yet without sin so even our Lord was restrained to a life and a Ministry that had already been written in a book about him to do thy will o God above when he said sacrifice and offering and burn offerings and offering for sin thou what is not neither has pleasure therein which are offered by the law then said he law I come to do thy will o God he taketh away the first that he may establish the second this is a surrender because Jesus was a hundred percent man he had a will how do we know that Gethsemane not my will nevertheless if at all possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless what did he say not my will so just because you have a book written about your life doesn't mean you don't have a will and it doesn't mean that there will not be times many times that your will and his will will be in conflict and it is in that moment that we must learn to quickly throw ourselves on the mercy of The Rock [Music] because whosoever falleth upon the rock shall be what broken but whosoever the rock shall fall upon shall be crushed to powder so it's better for you to say oh god I've been striving for my will throw yourself on the rock my will but your will be done you know a lot of people choose their will because their will seems easier it seems more convenient it seems like there's less sacrifice but I want you to know if you've ever made a sacrifice to do the will of God you'll get it back time and time and time again if you ever heard a call of God that said get you out from among your father's Kindred and I will take you to a place or to a land of which you've never known if you've ever had that kind of call and you packed up your stuff and you hit the road to do what God told you to do you'll never suffer because of that he'll give it back to you press down shaken together and running over you'll never lose family and not gain another family God always will if we're willing a Baptist man who prophesied over brother Branham because thou Hast chosen the harder way a huge portion of Heaven Waits you how many of you believe that wasn't just for a prophet how many of you believe that's for any servant of the Lord if you'll choose the harder way which sometimes is his perfect plan for your life sometimes that's a harder way it's not always such but sometimes it's a harder way somebody's struggling today to do God's perfect will but you won't have to struggle if you'll just throw yourself on the Rock break me break my will break my will if that's what it takes Here I Am Lord asking you to help my will but if my will needs more than help if my will needs to be broken I throw myself on the rock break me where I need to be broken because it'd be far better for me to be broken by casting myself on the Rock than to have the rock to fall on me and crush me to a pile of powder there is a consequence for continuing to choose our own will and our own way when there's a book that's already been written is anybody hearing what the Lord's trying to say to us today I hope you are there was a book in heaven that chronicled what Kingdom Purpose Jesus would fulfill in the earth and he was marching out step by step minute by minute moment by moment Choice by choice he was stepping out that plan that the father had for him in the message Divine love let's take a look at it in the time we have last Sunday with you here I believe I preached on the assurance the power that God had promised and ordained you and called you before the foundation of the world and put your name in his book I'd like for somebody to read me that next line you didn't choose your mama you didn't choose your daddy you didn't choose your race every bit of these things were chosen on our behalf we didn't have anything to do with it God did it he said isn't that wonderful I think it is the Lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and why it never happened till 4 000 years later the realization and the reality of what God had on his mind before the foundation of the world took 4 000 years to be a reality on the Earth but here's the key to remember God was letting his people withdraw from the bank that had never received the deposit for four thousand years they were eating of the goodness of God that were only attainable under the full Redemption and the full Redemption had not yet been given so God is a good god I want to say one more time and I hope you never misunderstand me when I say he fixed it I hope you always understand what I mean everything that God requires of us he provides for us so that we can't lose you cannot fail he said his bride cannot fail he said why because he's always there if you'll call on him when I Call On Jesus it never happened till 4 000 years later but God when he spoke it um he had to do it because he has to keep his word and the same time remember all those times God never changes his mind about his word because he can't he's Bound by his own word and the same time that the lamb was wrote down you were wrote with him and the same time the lamb and the same time that the lamb was wrote down you or wrote with him when it made it to the book that the lamb is going to come four thousand years after the creation the lamb is going to come and he's going to die on a cross crucified at the hands of his own men his own people with the help of a Roman occupier when all of this was recorded in that book the prophet tells us here you were wrote with him this is a confirmation that the bride was with him even in him in the beginning and the Bible tells us in the New Testament nothing can separate you from that place that's his love nothing can separate us from the love of God if you believe that say Amen you were wrote with him our names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life not the night we come to Christ remember the old hymn there's a new name written down in glory the scripture doesn't say that the scripture says before the foundation of the world the Bible said so so that's the assurance Blessed assurance [Music] Jesus Is Mine oh what up for Taste Of Glory divine fine air of salvation purchase of God born of his Spirit washed in his blood oh this is my story this is my song praising my sins savior all the day long this is my story [Music] this is my song praising my saved savior all the day long perfect submission perfect Delight visions of Russia numbers on my side Angels descending [Music] bring from above Echoes of murder Mercy Whispers of Love sing it with us this is my story Glory this is my song praising my sins say all the day long this is my story this is my song praising My Savior all the day long let's sound so good let's do another verse perfect submission [Music] all is at rest I in my savior I'm happy and blessed wait watching and [Music] waiting looking think about it filled with his lost now you sing it out this is my story this is my song praising my say your of the day long this is my story this is my song praising my saved your all the day long be seated just a moment Jesus came with a passion and with a commitment to complete what had been written in the books of Heaven about him the ministry of the Lamb was pre-planned in the mind of God and recorded ahead of time in the book of redemption prophetically do you believe that in the message influence brother Branham said now if you want your example to lay aside your pattern to see what the scripture goes together with just lay Jesus over here and go to watching him and placed it in the Bible you got the whole thing come out right because it's the of Jesus Christ the New Testament and Old both all speak of Jesus see Jesus Christ the son of God because he is the this book of redemption you understand Jesus is the book he is the book he is the book of redemption he was the word and he is the word and that's bound to be him you see so this is the whole book of redemption which is Jesus Christ fitly put together by God let me give you the visual he was the word and he is the word and that's bound to be him you see so this is the whole book of redemption which is Jesus Christ fitly put together by God with the promises of redemption and healing and everything for the human being see everything we have need of is there he said do you get that now and I want you to read the next sentence for me would you thank you Jesus Christ this book is Jesus Christ Old Testament and New he's in every offering he's in every sacrifice he's in all the temple order in the Tabernacle order he's in the worship of the old and in the new every every piece of furniture points to Jesus in the Tabernacle every every curtain points to Jesus every brass knob points to Jesus the Candlestick the shoe bread the labor everything points to Jesus the book is Jesus Christ put together by God see and he come as a human being and redeemed us and every promise is in him and for you for he is what he's the Redeemer just a little more in closing I want you to read John 1 14 in the Amplified and the word Christ and the word Christ became flesh human incarnate and tabernacled I love this fixed his tent of Flesh and lived a while for you he tabernacled he fixed this tent of Flesh lived a while Among Us and we actually saw his glory his honor his majesty such Glory as an only begotten son receives from his father full of grace favor loving kindness and Truth his physical birth allowed what was written in the book of Heaven to be manifested about him in the flesh God's word became fleshed out and Jesus lived every day to do his father's will John 5 19 and 20 then answered Jesus and said unto them verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise for the Father loveth the Son and showeth him all things about excuse me and showeth him all things that himself doeth and he will show him Greater Works than these that you may Marvel see Jesus was just being led by vision of his father and where did the vision come from it come out of the book there's a bride in the Earth the Sperma of God the seed of God is that correct and do you know what her commission is to live every day out of the vision of the book now that means that somebody's going to have to quit wrestling with God foreign it means someone is going to have to be sitting stop setting an enmity against God and say God I'm I'm ready for you to live my life I'm ready for you to come and direct my path I'm trying to tired of trying to figure it out by myself I need your help John 5 30 same chapter verse 30 he said I can of mine own self do nothing as I as I hear I judge and my judgment is just because I seek not my own will but the will of the father which hath sent me in the little film the 20th century prophet brother Branham says this but here I'll quote his words he said verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he sees the father do this doeth the son likewise then according to his own words his ministry was based upon Visions from his father he saw it in the spirit and he did it I don't think anybody in this room believes that Jesus healed every sick person I think we've all read the Gospels I think we've read that the Bible said if everything that he did everything he said if it were recorded in a book that the worlds that's why I don't get bent out of shape like some religious folks do if you see something portrayed in a film or something like that that's a little more or a little different or or a connection May somebody really raked me over the colds this week because they said there's nowhere in the Bible that Peter's wife had a miscarriage I said my dear religious brother that's how I dress the answer my dear religious brother there's nothing in the word that says that Peter's wife didn't have a miscarriage God bless you brother Shelley he wanted 10 pages out of me but I didn't have 10 pages to give him if everything that went that went on in the three and a half years of our Lord's Earthly Ministry if everything that happened to him and everything that happened around him was written in the book The Worlds wouldn't contain the book here's what I say somebody had a miscarriage somebody had a broken heart somebody was going through something whether it was Peter's wife or not and Jesus could only minister to her according to a vision from his father sometimes a modern Church says I I just can't hardly stand it when I pass somebody in a wheelchair I just can't hardly stand it such and such and such of course of course in our heart we want to see everybody healed perhaps Jesus would have loved to have seen everybody heal but everything he did in his Earthly Ministry was given to him as vision from the father he couldn't do one thing more than what the father commissioned him to do or one thing less and there is a little bride on the earth that's bound to the same Ministry it's only what the Lord reveals to us to do for instance the Lord dealt with me pretty seriously about not taking on the social justice Gospel of the modern Church he warned me specifically about the doctrine of the seven mountains and he warned me specifically about the social justice Gospel of the church there are plenty of churches and plenty of Ministries who can Herald the message of social justice but you and I are called only to do not to feed the whole world not to heal the whole world not to minister to the whole world but to minister to the ones that God sends us to to meet the needs of those that God sends us to now that may sound limiting but it's actually bigger than our imagination because we haven't even began to discover what God has for us in the great last great last Quick short demonstration of his authority in the bride brother Branham said she's going to have that bride thus saith the Lord or she's going to what she's going to keep still she's not just going to go running through them all trying to do something to every person that she sees this is not going to go over so well with some streamers of the spirit nothing wrong with that in fact the Bible said as many as are led by the spirit they are they are the sons of God then according to his own words his ministry was based upon Visions from his father so then Jesus spent the next 30 plus years of his life fulfilling what had meant 30 plus what had been written in his book that real Ministry of Jesus didn't begin until his baptism I know the a lot of times the movies have him healing children in the playpens where he lay or making the little clay pigeon come to life like the Jesus movie that went all around the world but we have no reason to believe in the Bible that he had any out of the ordinary experiences other than what's mentioned in the scripture and that was the wisdom that God had already placed in him baffled the teachers of the law the Bible records his first miracle as as being at the marriage of Cana where he spoke and created wine from water saving the best for last I believe that's prophetic of the day we're living in Saving The Best For Last anybody with me and we don't have any reason to believe his Earthly Ministry started until he stood in the in the Jordan River and his cousins proclaimed Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin to the world and a voice spoke out of the heavenlies and said this is my beloved Son the best translation of that verse is this this is my beloved Son in whom I am pleased to dwell it pleases me to dwell in him and that was it from that moment on Jesus goes performs his first miracle ministers three and a half years on the Earth just before he finishes the last phase of ministry he's on top of Mount Hermon with his inner circle he is transfigured before them that word tells us that his skin glistened like gold that to look at him would have been looking at a golden man of light because even the pores of his physical body were transfigured into Divine Light I'm telling you that's powerful you just let a little bit of that light shine in the Dark World it'll go a long way don't need it all just a little of that to shine and make a difference we sometimes hear the the apostles rebuke even brother Branham corrects them a little bit there and says isn't that just like the denominational-minded people everybody wanting to build a church but it takes somebody like me Born To Be A worshiper to read that and see the other side no no dispute I believe exactly what brother random said there were those who had that mentality let's build a church let's make a denomination let's let's divide the body but as a worshiper as someone who is not born to be the messenger of the seven Angel but born rather to be a worshiper when I read that I I relate to the part that says we don't ever want to leave this place let's build us a place so we don't ever have to leave this presence let us stay right but here where the glory is don't want to go nowhere else but how many of you know that's not practical either the musicians are coming that's not practical either because there's a world that's got to see the light then there was a voice that spoke Out of Heaven that day and it said this is my beloved Son and those next three words are some of the most significant words ever spoken of the father over his son and what do those words say hear ye him this was his full adoption started at the Jordan River it ended at the Mount of transfiguration Mount Hermon I mentioned to you Tuesday night her soul goal that at the bottom of Mount Hermon is is Banya caesarea Philippi where all of those false gods are being worshiped even Caesar had a temple there in Pan the flute playing dancing goat is worshiped there and several others and Jesus is walking along there with his disciples and in the midst of all that Pagan worship he says who do you Fellers think I am they say well you're the Messiah some say you're Elias some say you're Elias some say you're John the Baptist or one of the prophets they believed in reincarnation or something there didn't they some kind of Resurrection something secret Resurrection while they would have made good message Believers there's some some of them that believe in secret resurrections don't they intent Ministries and return Ministries and all kinds of things like that ouch some say thou art Elias or John the Baptist or one of the prophets he said who do you say that I the son of man I am and Peter Peter laughs he ain't very tall but he's got arms Peter why why why why why not why not why not go through loss the Catholic Church tells us he was never married can anybody in this room tell me why any man in his rightful mind would choose to have a mother-in-law and not be married and I had a wonderful one my wife gave me a whole lot sweeter Kinder mother-in-law than I gave her my mother-in-law didn't make my way hard she believed in my Ministry she Faithfully supported our life together but why would any the Bible says that his mother-in-law was sick with a fever and yet the Catholic Church says he was never married why because they want to stuff him into being a pope no such thing Jesus said Thou Art Peter cephas blessed art thou Simon barjona son of Jonas for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee why because Peter said yeah some say you're John some say your lies yeah some say that Peter who do you say I the son of man am Thou Art the Messiah Thou Art the mashiach Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God Jesus turns around right the whole time they're going in and out with their sacrifices to dance and goat gods and all kinds of pagan religions there come on right there with their Valentine's candy and their Christmas trees and all their all these message churches with their Valentine's Banquets and sweetheart Banquets this weekend I don't have time for that Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God you don't understand folks unless you understand the mentality of the Jews in the second temple period nobody believed that that the Messiah would be the son of God the Jewish people did not believe in the second temple period that when Messiah came he would be the Son of God they believed he would be a god-gifted military man they believed that he would come and physically deliver them from the occupation of the Romans and they believed that he would be a righteous man in all of his ways but they did not teach no no synagogue was teaching no Jewish scholar was teaching that there would be a messiah who would be God man but little Peter you remember him you're not taking my Lord anywhere pulled his sword out and chopped the ears servant's ears if you and I would have been there we'd have been saying go Peter go peace looks over Peter this isn't the way it's done and like he has done for me a thousand times and for you a thousand times he just Stoops over and fixes Peter's mess Lord I want to thank you for every time you've put the ear back on I want to thank you for every time you fix my messes Lord when I did the dumbest things and you came in and fixed my mess Jesus just reached over and put the servant's ear back on slapped it right back on his head this is not the way it's done aren't you glad he's always there to cover for us Peter that that that Reed blown in the Wind they talk about Peter and they say oh he was the Rock of Gibraltar where he didn't start out the Rock of Gibraltar he started out like a little rolling piece of gravel pea gravel that word Petros that word that's there means a small Stone thou art a small Stone Peter you're a rolling piece of gravel but when I get through with you the whole church is going to hang on the truth that God just revealed to you in my presence Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus said blessed art thou Simon barjona for flesh and blood and church Seminary has not revealed it unto you but my Father which is in heaven Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock not Petros not Peter this rock is not referring to the PO the little Rolling Stone this rock is is referring to the Revelation that Jesus Christ is the son of the Living God Upon This Rock I will build my church and the gates of hell it didn't say they wouldn't come against wouldn't March against wouldn't try to put it out it said and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it how many of you want to praise the Lord for what he's done Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah what a blessed people we are to know that if we can just keep surrendering to the book we are indeed a people of the book and it is our calling to keep surrendering to the book that the Lord has written about our lives You Don't Have To Fear death itself in fact you don't have to fear disease you don't have to fear the problems that the enemy sends to take you out because the grace of God is sufficient in all cases and one of these days when it's time for you to leave you're leaving you could leave in the finest hospital with the best doctor taking the best medicine but one day when the Lord calls us home we're leaving here hallelujah I'm not looking for the first boat load out but I don't want to be here one day longer than he wants me here I want to be here as long as it takes to fulfill everything my father has written about me one of the reasons why I need this time away it's because I want to have an opportunity without without pressure to reevaluate and I want to make sure that I discover I don't have to have the next five years outlined for me but I need to know that the next few months I can discover what God's perfect plan is for my life and Ministry I cannot afford to miss one page of my destiny book you my friend cannot afford to spend another night doing your own will your own way well this makes me feel good I don't care whether it makes you feel good or not if it's not God's perfect will for your life who do you love the most do you love yourself more or do you love his will more well I tell you what his bride loves him more the enemy will kind of delude you and confuse you and make you not know the difference between the two you can break out of that today and commit your life to him and say Lord I don't want to live another day not another day until I know I don't have to know don't be greedy you don't have to know the next chapter you don't have to get out and start telling God God I want you to show me the next five years of my life why all you need to know is what God would have you to do today when you get up tomorrow you need to know what God would have you do tomorrow and I'm going to tell you something I'm closing I know I've taken time you you will you will not have to hear me now for a couple of weeks I told these fellas over in this direction over here the brisket Kings I told them the other night when I was sitting there with with Josh and charity and I said sometimes I look at my hand and I say where did my hand go I know you're quiet I'm glad that you're also Young that it ain't struck you yet but all of a sudden one day I looked at my hand and I said where did that hand come from that's not the hand I used to have it didn't used to look like that anybody caught me yet it don't look like it used to look s like the skin is a little thinner and I can see the pores and why do hands have to wrinkle what's that is that supposed to is that there to teach me humility and it's life it's 54 years of change sister Flo's pointing at her cheeks you

aging I just looked down one day and it had and I don't want to miss that time in between so I've been spending some time already Lord I don't want to waste a minute of my life I want to be doing what you would have me to do with who you would have me to do it I don't have time to hang out with somebody bad for me I need to be hanging out with somebody that I can help or might be helping me some along the way come on I don't have time to be stuck in a in a place where I don't want to be in a position that I don't want to be in but I realize at least for me I I'm I'm approaching those years where where you should be reflective and I don't want there to be one sentence in my book unfulfilled because I chose my own way instead of his way I don't want to get to heaven and find one thing that was mine that I didn't utilize here on the Earth and I encourage you whether you're 55 like I'm soon to be or whether you're 15.

come into alignment and it looks convenient and it seems right but we want to know Lord that everything we do now is according to your great big divine plan and I know that when we think this we're thinking about preachers we're thinking about ministers but Lord you want us as a people as a body as sons of God to think about our own lives in this manner mothers fathers sisters brothers young
