TRANSCRIPT
========================================
this is a woman who has a destiny that's bigger than her profession bigger than her behavior and that's what Solomon asked God to let him see we read where God appears to King Solomon in a dream and in this dream God speaks directly to King Solomon and says to him whatever you ask of me I'm going to give it to you how many of you know that's a good dream God was in it God showed up God did the talking and God performed what he said and I would like to read for you the prayer that Solomon prayed in response to God visiting him in a dream he said give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people that I may discern between good and bad for who is able to judge this thy so great of people Solomon is asking Lord give me a hearing heart a hearing mind that I might be able to make a judgment a discernment about that which is good and that word Toth is a word that is sometimes translated to me fully functional Lord give me a heart to discern between that which is fully functional and and bad tove is good raaah is bad rah it's not necessarily evil the sometimes it can be used with an evil intent but it also can be translated not bringing forth full potential so God give me a hearing mind Solomon's pray that I might be able to discern between that which is functioning fully as the Creator designed it to function he didn't want to just be able to have to say good evil he said I want to be able to cut the line right down between the most productive and and and the saddest seed it's not producing even a third of the potential all right now Solomon is asking the Lord I want to be able to see and discern and hear the difference between a seed that's bringing forth fullness and one that is not and guess what happens God answers his prayer he not only grants him that ability he does it quickly he's being tested now on his prayer and guess who is next in line for their appointment in the presence of the king two prostitutes not one righteous woman and one filthy woman - filthy women [Music] evil it's evil but I want you to know Solomon didn't pray Lord let me see the good from the evil he said let me see the good from the bad let me see the toll from the raw so here come two prostitutes both of them participating in evil things but Solomon had an answer to his prayer now the Jewish sages believe that he knew immediately who the mother was but he knew it was very important for those witnessing this moment to see who the mother was but because of the wisdom and because of the hearing heart to discern the difference between fully functional and not he said bring me a sword that was really all he had to say he said bring me a sword and we're going to divide the baby and the real mother steps forward and she does not say notice this she does not say I'm the real mother give the baby to me you know why that would have been wrong not evil bad I wasn't gonna produce anything see just a moment ago she'd been selling herself or giving herself away she wasn't thinking about the welfare of that baby when she was choosing her profession and her lifestyle this is not a noble woman but this is a woman who has a destiny that's bigger than her discipline this is a woman who has a destiny that's bigger than her profession bigger than her behavior and that's what Solomon asked God to let him see
