[1:06:46] such talented and anointed musicians and
[1:06:49] leaders
[1:06:50] to lead us in worship
[1:06:52] we're glad that you're in the house of
[1:06:54] the Lord today to our home folk and to
[1:06:56] our visitors we welcome you in the name
[1:06:59] of the Lord
[1:07:00] and we
[1:07:02] bring you greetings from our pastor and
[1:07:04] from his family
[1:07:05] on a a little holiday a sabbatical
[1:07:09] we just are grateful that the Lord is
[1:07:11] strengthening them and helping them we
[1:07:14] miss them very much but we're glad that
[1:07:17] they could have this time away and we
[1:07:19] are pressing in to keep the home fires
[1:07:23] burning to continue to press into this
[1:07:27] Supernatural year that the Lord has
[1:07:29] given to us he is Supernatural God and
[1:07:33] we are grateful that he is doing
[1:07:34] Supernatural things we don't always
[1:07:37] recognize it but he is he's doing things
[1:07:41] that are above and beyond the natural
[1:07:43] realm and we are so very thankful for
[1:07:46] that to all of you that are watching
[1:07:48] this service by way of live stream we
[1:07:51] notice Norway and Trinidad and the UK
[1:07:54] and all over the United States we
[1:07:57] welcome you to this service and trust
[1:08:00] that the Lord will bless you in whatever
[1:08:03] way that you need his Blessing
[1:08:06] you know I'm I'm beginning to realize
[1:08:08] that the biggest blessing that some
[1:08:10] people could get from the Lord is a
[1:08:12] spanking
[1:08:16] to get them back in line
[1:08:19] not because I want them hurt but because
[1:08:21] they need to get back in line and and
[1:08:24] and it may not feel like a blessing at
[1:08:26] the time but really if they get back in
[1:08:29] alignment with God and they look back on
[1:08:31] it they realize that that spanking was a
[1:08:34] blessing
[1:08:35] so I say may God bless you in whatever
[1:08:38] way you need to be blessed
[1:08:42] if it's a good blessing if it's a
[1:08:44] spanking blessing he knows how to do it
[1:08:47] and I don't have to tell him how don't
[1:08:49] have to tell him what I can just say God
[1:08:52] you bless the people the way they need
[1:08:54] to be blessed
[1:08:56] as we sit under the hearing of the word
[1:08:58] he can bless us and move us shift us
[1:09:01] help us to get in alignment I'd like to
[1:09:04] go back to Malachi chapter 3 where we
[1:09:07] were last Sunday
[1:09:09] we were blessed to have brother Shelley
[1:09:11] here on Tuesday night uh not real nice
[1:09:15] circumstances but God knows what he's
[1:09:18] doing and we're continuing to pray for
[1:09:21] the Shelley family that God will grant
[1:09:23] them strength and comfort at the loss of
[1:09:26] more Shelley and we continue to press on
[1:09:30] believing that we will have a glad
[1:09:33] reunion day
[1:09:34] amen and originally it was announced
[1:09:38] that brother Shelley would be preaching
[1:09:39] today but he was here on Tuesday night
[1:09:42] and I just really want the Lord to do
[1:09:46] everything for him that the Lord wants
[1:09:48] to do and I want to stand at my post of
[1:09:51] Duty with gladness to speak to you and
[1:09:55] give you the word of the Lord so last
[1:09:57] Sunday we were in Malachi chapter 3 and
[1:10:00] we got through the first five verses of
[1:10:03] the chapter and uh so let us just pick
[1:10:07] up in verse 6.
[1:10:09] Malachi 3 and we'll start in verse six
[1:10:13] for I am the Lord I change not
[1:10:16] therefore you sons of Jacob are not
[1:10:19] consumed
[1:10:21] from the days of your fathers you're
[1:10:24] gone away from mine ordinances and have
[1:10:26] not kept them return unto me and I will
[1:10:30] return unto you saith the Lord of hosts
[1:10:33] but you have said wherein shall we
[1:10:36] return
[1:10:37] will a man rob God yet you have robbed
[1:10:41] me
[1:10:41] but you say wherein have we robbed thee
[1:10:45] in tithe and offerings
[1:10:47] you're cursed with a curse for you have
[1:10:50] robbed me even this whole nation
[1:10:54] bring ye all the tithes into the
[1:10:56] storehouse that there may be meat in my
[1:10:58] house and prove me now here with saith
[1:11:01] the Lord of hosts if I will not open to
[1:11:03] you the windows of heaven and pour you
[1:11:05] out a blessing that there shall not be
[1:11:09] room enough to receive it
[1:11:12] and I will rebuke the Devourer for your
[1:11:16] sakes and he shall not destroy the
[1:11:18] fruits of your ground neither shall your
[1:11:20] Vine cast her fruit before the time in
[1:11:23] the field saith the Lord of hosts
[1:11:25] and All Nations shall call you blessed
[1:11:28] for you shall be a delightsome land
[1:11:31] saith the Lord of hosts
[1:11:33] your words have been Stout against me
[1:11:36] saith the Lord yet you say what have we
[1:11:39] spoken so much against thee
[1:11:42] you have said it is vain to serve God
[1:11:45] and what profit is it that we have kept
[1:11:48] his ordinance and that we have walked
[1:11:50] mournfully before the Lord of hosts
[1:11:52] and now we call the proud happy yea they
[1:11:55] that work wickedness are set up yea they
[1:11:59] that tempt God or even delivered
[1:12:02] and they that feared the Lord spake
[1:12:04] often one to another and the Lord
[1:12:07] hearkened and heard it and a book of
[1:12:09] remembrance was written before him for
[1:12:12] them that feared the Lord and that
[1:12:15] thought upon his name let's get the last
[1:12:18] two verses in and they shall be mine
[1:12:19] saith the Lord of hosts in that day when
[1:12:23] I shall make up my jewels
[1:12:25] and I will spare them as a man spareth
[1:12:28] his own son that serveth him then shall
[1:12:31] you return and discern between the
[1:12:34] righteous and the wicked between him
[1:12:36] that serveth God and him that serveth
[1:12:39] him not
[1:12:40] may the Lord add a blessing to the
[1:12:42] reading of his word and you can have
[1:12:44] your seats today
[1:13:02] last week we
[1:13:04] were looking at this same chapter and
[1:13:08] taking it verse by verse
[1:13:11] this is a
[1:13:14] what we called an ongoing prophecy a
[1:13:18] prophecy that continues to be updated
[1:13:21] uh it has had a prophetic value it has
[1:13:25] had a prophetic significance in years
[1:13:28] past it is currently being uh carried
[1:13:33] out we are seeing things in this chapter
[1:13:36] that are currently coming to pass
[1:13:39] they're currently unfolding before us
[1:13:41] and then we know that is if if as time
[1:13:45] tarries should that be God's plan that
[1:13:47] we're going to see this happen happen
[1:13:49] over again it's just the way God works
[1:13:53] when he uh he gave us scripture for that
[1:13:57] purpose
[1:13:58] scripture doesn't come to us to go away
[1:14:02] he takes a passage of scripture and
[1:14:06] allows us to get new understanding new
[1:14:10] meaning new benefit as the years go by
[1:14:14] something can be in a place where that
[1:14:17] we don't Focus too much on it and then
[1:14:20] all of the sudden God highlights it and
[1:14:22] he brings it back to our remembrance and
[1:14:25] he uses the word to speak to us all over
[1:14:28] again in an updated manner God lifts
[1:14:33] himself out of the pages of history for
[1:14:36] us to benefit from and we can be
[1:14:40] benefited by the word of God if we allow
[1:14:43] him to be a present tense God rather
[1:14:46] than an I was God
[1:14:49] he is I am
[1:14:52] not I was
[1:14:54] or even I will be although we know he
[1:14:57] will be and we know he was but he is
[1:14:59] currently present tense I am carrying
[1:15:03] out his word to us so that we can better
[1:15:06] align ourselves with him with his word
[1:15:09] and he's talking to us if we'll listen
[1:15:13] and so uh one of the things that we like
[1:15:17] carried on last week was the refiners
[1:15:19] fire and the uh Fuller soap the refiners
[1:15:24] fire being a very hot fire that would
[1:15:27] melt metal down uh not a pleasant
[1:15:31] thought to be someone who is in The
[1:15:34] Melting Pot
[1:15:35] in the fire to where that we're being
[1:15:38] melted down but God does this so that we
[1:15:42] will allow all of the dross all of the
[1:15:45] impurities to rise to the top
[1:15:47] so that he can skim them off and as we
[1:15:51] have already said there are there are
[1:15:54] times that God allows these processes to
[1:15:57] repeat because when this happens he
[1:16:00] gives us the opportunity to repent for
[1:16:03] the sin that we can see
[1:16:07] I can't see all of them
[1:16:10] but I repent for the sin the unbelief
[1:16:13] that I see at this current moment
[1:16:16] and then we go on a little way and God
[1:16:19] allows us to some of those things that
[1:16:21] uh maybe we we were hurt and and it
[1:16:25] caused us to to have anxiety to think
[1:16:28] about these things that we'd hurt God
[1:16:30] With God lets us go on a little while
[1:16:32] and then we have to go in the Melting
[1:16:33] Pot again and and he he lets that dross
[1:16:36] come to the top again and we have to
[1:16:38] repent for the sin that we see and he
[1:16:41] repeats this process over and over again
[1:16:43] and then the Fuller soap that whitening
[1:16:47] soap of the Fuller we told you that the
[1:16:50] Fuller was one who beat and pounded and
[1:16:53] stomped
[1:16:54] to get the clothes clean and he used a
[1:16:57] special soap the whitening soap and
[1:16:59] that's what the blood of Jesus does for
[1:17:02] us and we a lot of times feel like we're
[1:17:05] being pounded we feel like we're being
[1:17:06] stomped on we feel like that we're
[1:17:09] getting a real beating but all of this
[1:17:11] is for the purposes of God to unfold in
[1:17:15] our life
[1:17:16] it doesn't feel good no chastening feels
[1:17:20] good at the moment
[1:17:22] but we know that it is working a
[1:17:24] beautiful art piece of God
[1:17:28] every piece of art that goes into the
[1:17:31] Hall of Fame first has to go through the
[1:17:34] Hall of critics
[1:17:35] [Music]
[1:17:36] every believer that's going to ever make
[1:17:39] it in a Rapture is going to have to go
[1:17:42] through the refiners fire and the Fuller
[1:17:44] soap and the beating and the pounding
[1:17:46] and the chastening it's just part of
[1:17:49] this walk with the Lord
[1:17:52] we can either become bitter
[1:17:55] angry
[1:17:56] Disturbed
[1:17:58] run away
[1:18:00] or we can come up close to the Lord and
[1:18:04] let him apply the sav of his Sweet Holy
[1:18:09] Spirit to us and let all of those things
[1:18:12] that we have felt like that we have been
[1:18:14] so hurt by he can rub save in them and
[1:18:18] we can allow that chastening of the Lord
[1:18:21] to bring us right in line with him
[1:18:25] so then we tell we we concluded last
[1:18:29] Sunday service with uh verse 5 after we
[1:18:33] talked about the peace of God settling
[1:18:36] down over us and and letting him bring
[1:18:38] our praise back and we talked about
[1:18:40] these seven things in verse 5 that he
[1:18:43] was going to be a swift witness against
[1:18:45] so we pick up today in verse 6.
[1:18:49] for I am the Lord I change not
[1:18:52] therefore you sons of Jacob are not
[1:18:56] consumed
[1:18:58] if God
[1:18:59] consumed everybody
[1:19:01] that
[1:19:03] ever trespassed him
[1:19:12] there'd be a whole bunch of grease on
[1:19:14] the pavement
[1:19:17] and anybody who was left would slip and
[1:19:19] fall on our Grease
[1:19:23] but he is the Lord and
[1:19:25] it is not
[1:19:29] sure from Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 8
[1:19:32] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:19:35] and today and forever
[1:19:38] he does not change
[1:19:41] when Abraham was walking with the Lord
[1:19:45] and God called him out of his uh his
[1:19:49] land of nativity where he grew up and he
[1:19:53] there were Idols all around him his name
[1:19:55] was Abram and God called Abram out and
[1:19:58] he said come out from the land of your
[1:20:01] fathers and walk with me and I will take
[1:20:04] you into a land that is Flowing with
[1:20:07] milk and honey a land that you don't
[1:20:09] know anything about I'm going to give it
[1:20:12] to you if you're willing to come with me
[1:20:16] and I'm gonna give you seed and uh the
[1:20:19] this your seed are going to be like the
[1:20:21] stars in the sky going to be like the
[1:20:24] sand of the seashore
[1:20:26] and God gives him all of this word
[1:20:32] just like he's given you this
[1:20:36] God gave Abraham all of this word and
[1:20:40] told him right now you are childless
[1:20:43] right now you're Barren right now you
[1:20:46] are in the midst of idolaters but you
[1:20:49] come out from among them and you walk
[1:20:52] with me and let me show you what I can
[1:20:55] do on your behalf I'm going to give you
[1:20:57] a son
[1:20:59] and so Abraham walks with him
[1:21:03] and the Bible in the New Testament says
[1:21:06] that Abraham staggered not at the
[1:21:08] promise of God through unbelief but was
[1:21:12] strong in faith
[1:21:19] this gives me hope
[1:21:23] gives me a glorious hope because
[1:21:26] God gave us a back story about Abraham
[1:21:33] and my natural eyes see that Abraham
[1:21:37] staggered some
[1:21:39] my natural eyes see that Abraham made
[1:21:42] mistakes my natural eyes see and read
[1:21:47] that Abraham lied
[1:21:49] to rulers to Kings somebody that could
[1:21:53] have took his head off
[1:21:55] but because that the promise of God was
[1:21:58] upon Abraham's life
[1:22:02] his life could not be taken before its
[1:22:06] time
[1:22:07] because there was a promise that had to
[1:22:10] be fulfilled in Abraham's life and even
[1:22:14] though my natural mind my reading and
[1:22:17] and comprehension of the back story it
[1:22:21] looks like that Abraham made all kinds
[1:22:24] of mistakes it looks like that he did
[1:22:26] not trust the promise of God it looks
[1:22:29] like he went astray it looks like that
[1:22:31] he lied and he told all kinds of stories
[1:22:34] about Sarah being his sister and this
[1:22:36] kind of thing to to cause people to be
[1:22:39] deceived or to be led astray yet God
[1:22:43] comes over in the New Testament
[1:22:46] and says Abraham staggered not at the
[1:22:50] promise of God
[1:22:52] through unbelief
[1:23:01] you have this same finished story
[1:23:06] I have this same finished story
[1:23:11] because as was preached here by our
[1:23:13] pastor on Tuesday night by a prefix
[1:23:16] Destiny by God's foreknowledge
[1:23:21] he Those whom he foreknew he could
[1:23:25] predestinate or give a prefix Destiny he
[1:23:29] already knew by his foreknowledge he
[1:23:32] knew your choice he knew the choices
[1:23:35] that you would make the good ones
[1:23:38] and the dumbleness
[1:23:43] the lovely ones and the ugly ones he
[1:23:46] knew all of those decisions but he knew
[1:23:50] that the ultimate decision that you
[1:23:52] would make would be to follow him
[1:23:55] and because of that ultimate decision of
[1:23:58] you saying yes Lord he could give you a
[1:24:01] prefix destiny
[1:24:03] and he could line out a path for you
[1:24:08] that would intertwine with all of these
[1:24:10] people sitting here
[1:24:14] and he could at the end of your story
[1:24:19] say
[1:24:20] as he did Abraham
[1:24:23] he staggered not
[1:24:25] at the promise
[1:24:28] do I fail
[1:24:30] yes
[1:24:32] do you fail yes
[1:24:35] do you make mistakes yes
[1:24:38] but the key is you keep coming back as
[1:24:41] Abraham did to El Shaddai
[1:24:44] you keep coming back to that one that
[1:24:47] can pour pour strength into you and
[1:24:50] cause you now God understood all of
[1:24:53] these things about
[1:24:56] Abraham Abram and then Abraham and when
[1:25:00] Abraham after his name had been changed
[1:25:04] he had this promised son Isaac
[1:25:08] and God told Abraham take him up to
[1:25:11] Mount Moriah and there offer him
[1:25:16] so Abraham
[1:25:18] obedient
[1:25:20] has already settled the issue before he
[1:25:22] ever climbs the mountain
[1:25:25] and
[1:25:26] lays him upon the
[1:25:29] altar
[1:25:33] and he lifts the knife
[1:25:37] take his life to take Isaac's life
[1:25:43] and the angel of the Lord stopped his
[1:25:45] hand
[1:25:47] and we pick up in Genesis chapter 22
[1:25:50] verse 15.
[1:25:52] the angel of the Lord called unto
[1:25:54] Abraham Out of Heaven the second time
[1:25:57] and he said by myself have I sworn saith
[1:26:01] the Lord be before because thou has done
[1:26:05] this thing and has not withheld thy son
[1:26:08] thine only son that in blessing I Will
[1:26:12] Bless thee and in multiplying I will
[1:26:15] multiply thy seed as the stars of the
[1:26:18] Heaven and the sand which is upon the
[1:26:21] seashore and thy seed shall possess the
[1:26:27] Gate of his enemy
[1:26:30] and in thy seed Christ shall all of the
[1:26:35] nations of the earth be blessed because
[1:26:38] thou Hast obeyed my voice now because of
[1:26:43] the because of The Obedience of Abraham
[1:26:49] This Promise came to him
[1:26:52] though he faltered along the way
[1:26:56] according to natural looking at things
[1:26:59] yet God saw the end of his story
[1:27:04] that he would in the end settle the
[1:27:07] whole matter and he would be willing to
[1:27:10] offer Isaac his son
[1:27:12] and God knew that there was something in
[1:27:16] Abraham already moving that Abraham was
[1:27:20] going to be at the end Abraham was going
[1:27:23] to be completely obedient
[1:27:26] forget all of the rest of the stuff all
[1:27:29] of the rest of the stuff
[1:27:32] in the end Abraham was going to be
[1:27:34] obedient
[1:27:35] God knew it
[1:27:37] and therefore God could give him a
[1:27:39] prefix Destiny and he could come and he
[1:27:41] could bless Abraham in such a way and he
[1:27:45] said by myself I have sworn there was no
[1:27:48] one Higher
[1:27:50] Hebrews chapter 6 verse 13 says for when
[1:27:53] God made a promise to Abraham
[1:27:56] because he could swear by no greater he
[1:28:00] swear by himself
[1:28:04] saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee
[1:28:08] and multiplying I will multiply thee and
[1:28:13] so after he had patiently endured he
[1:28:18] obtained the promise
[1:28:21] for men verily swear by the greater and
[1:28:25] an oath for Comfort May for confirmation
[1:28:28] is to them an end of all strife
[1:28:33] wherein God willing more abundantly to
[1:28:37] show unto The Heirs of promise
[1:28:40] the immutability of his counsel now you
[1:28:44] can take the opportunity to put yourself
[1:28:46] right in that verse
[1:28:48] because we are Heirs of the promise
[1:28:54] God willing more abundantly to show unto
[1:28:58] The Heirs of Promise the immutability of
[1:29:01] his counsel
[1:29:02] confirmed it by an oath
[1:29:06] that by two immutable things in which it
[1:29:11] was impossible for God to lie
[1:29:14] we might have a strong consolation who
[1:29:17] have fled for Refuge to lay hold upon
[1:29:21] the Hope set before us
[1:29:23] which hope we have as an anchor of the
[1:29:26] Soul both sure and steadfast and which
[1:29:30] entereth into that within the Veil
[1:29:34] wither the Forerunner is for us entered
[1:29:39] even Jesus made an high priest Forever
[1:29:43] After the order of Melchizedek
[1:29:47] now God made a promise to Abraham
[1:29:52] and he is the god who does not change
[1:29:57] and by two immutable things
[1:30:01] his promise
[1:30:03] and his oath
[1:30:06] his word and his Oath by two immutable
[1:30:09] things
[1:30:10] he has given
[1:30:12] this promise to Abraham but he also
[1:30:16] makes this
[1:30:18] promise transferable to those who are in
[1:30:22] Christ
[1:30:24] and so he has given us
[1:30:27] his word
[1:30:30] his promise
[1:30:34] now we happen to be in the same position
[1:30:37] as Abraham
[1:30:39] we are human beings
[1:30:43] and there are things that we have been
[1:30:47] told we have been prophesied to we have
[1:30:50] seen in the word and again there are
[1:30:53] these ongoing prophecies prophecies that
[1:30:56] we're looking to unfold before us and we
[1:30:59] get impatient with God
[1:31:03] but yet
[1:31:05] God doesn't change
[1:31:08] he is still God
[1:31:10] he gave his promise
[1:31:13] and because he could swear by no greater
[1:31:17] he swear by himself he gave us an oath
[1:31:22] of promise
[1:31:24] that he was going to perform his word
[1:31:28] now Abraham never saw the Fulfillment
[1:31:32] the complete fulfillment of what he was
[1:31:35] really looking for
[1:31:38] Abraham was in the older Covenant he
[1:31:41] obeyed god with everything that he was
[1:31:44] supposed to obey God with he finally had
[1:31:48] that promised son Isaac through Sarah
[1:31:51] not the Bond woman Hagar with Ishmael
[1:31:55] the wild seed no he had the son of
[1:32:00] promise but the son of Promise was
[1:32:03] really Christ Jesus the Lord
[1:32:06] and Abraham saw Isaac
[1:32:11] but he didn't really see
[1:32:14] the Fulfillment of the promise seed
[1:32:17] Christ
[1:32:20] he was already passed from the Earth
[1:32:24] God in all of his infinite wisdom let
[1:32:29] years Roll by let years Roll by let
[1:32:31] years Roll by until that the appointed
[1:32:36] time for Christ to come into the Earth
[1:32:39] Yeshua Jesus to come into the Earth God
[1:32:43] condescended into flesh human flesh
[1:32:47] walk the face of the Earth
[1:32:50] he had to come in the form of a man he
[1:32:54] came in a human body and he walked as we
[1:32:58] have been hearing 100 percent God 100
[1:33:01] percent man walking on the face of the
[1:33:04] Earth and then he walked up to that
[1:33:08] final place on his Earthly Journey
[1:33:11] Calvary
[1:33:14] because
[1:33:15] for us
[1:33:17] Abraham never got to see it
[1:33:21] he didn't even have the blessing of
[1:33:23] looking back in history to see that God
[1:33:27] came down in human flesh and walked on
[1:33:29] Earth and gave himself a ransom
[1:33:33] but we as uh Believers in 2023 we have
[1:33:38] the blessing to know that God has given
[1:33:42] a promise and he kept that promise and
[1:33:45] he came down to earth and he gave his
[1:33:47] life for a ransom he just didn't swear
[1:33:50] something out of his mouth
[1:33:53] but he delivered by giving his very life
[1:33:58] on Calvary
[1:34:02] he made a promise to you made a promise
[1:34:05] to Abraham
[1:34:06] when he made this promise
[1:34:10] he delivered on it by coming in human
[1:34:13] flesh
[1:34:15] but he gave away for a Believer so that
[1:34:19] this could remain God that does not
[1:34:22] change
[1:34:24] he made a way for believers
[1:34:28] to get back to him
[1:34:32] he told us in Romans chapter 10 but what
[1:34:36] saith it the word is neither even in thy
[1:34:39] mouth and in thy heart that is the word
[1:34:42] of faith which we preach that if Thou
[1:34:46] shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord
[1:34:49] Jesus and Shall Believe in thine heart
[1:34:52] that God hath raised him from the dead
[1:34:55] Thou shalt be saved
[1:34:58] this is God's promise to you
[1:35:02] for salvation
[1:35:06] and he didn't just give you
[1:35:09] a written promise
[1:35:12] and hope for the best
[1:35:15] but he swear by himself
[1:35:20] he did not send someone else to the
[1:35:23] cross
[1:35:27] hoping for the best
[1:35:32] in the beginning was the word
[1:35:35] and the word
[1:35:37] was with God the Word was God
[1:35:42] and the word became flesh
[1:35:44] and dwelled Among Us
[1:35:47] the word became flesh
[1:35:51] it was no longer just the low gosp but
[1:35:54] now it's a human form it is God In the
[1:35:58] Flesh dwelling Among Us coming down into
[1:36:01] this level so that he could demonstrate
[1:36:04] to us there was nobody greater than
[1:36:08] myself to swear by so I came myself
[1:36:12] and then he gave his life so that we
[1:36:14] could have salvation and not only
[1:36:16] salvation but that we could have
[1:36:18] sanctification first John 1 7-9 but if
[1:36:22] we walk in the light as he is in the
[1:36:25] light we have Fellowship one with
[1:36:28] another
[1:36:29] and the blood of Jesus Christ his son
[1:36:33] cleanses us from all sin
[1:36:36] if we say that we have no sin we deceive
[1:36:38] ourselves then the truth is not in US
[1:36:41] if we confess our sins
[1:36:46] he is faithful
[1:36:49] and just to forgive us our sins and to
[1:36:55] cleanse us from all unrighteousness
[1:37:01] anything in me in you that is not right
[1:37:07] unright not right
[1:37:10] all of it
[1:37:12] he is willing to cleanse us from it
[1:37:16] but if we have a part in this equation
[1:37:21] if we confess our sins
[1:37:25] he is faithful to forgive us our sins
[1:37:32] once again
[1:37:34] smoking is not a sin
[1:37:37] drinking not a sin doing drugs not a sin
[1:37:39] running with women not a sin these are
[1:37:42] all attributes of unbelief
[1:37:45] unbelief because we don't really believe
[1:37:48] the word of God
[1:37:50] that our Temple our body is the Temple
[1:37:53] of the Holy Ghost and we want to protect
[1:37:55] it at all costs and so we want to stay
[1:37:58] within the confines of the word of God
[1:38:00] so that we know that he's going to let
[1:38:02] his Blessing rest upon us according to
[1:38:05] his good pleasure
[1:38:07] so if we confess our sins he is faithful
[1:38:13] he is faithful
[1:38:15] he is faithful he is the same yesterday
[1:38:18] and today and forever
[1:38:22] all of those that are in the past the
[1:38:24] sins of the past what I see today
[1:38:28] what I may encounter tomorrow all of my
[1:38:31] unbelief
[1:38:32] let's just make sure we keep that word
[1:38:34] in there unbelief because we find
[1:38:37] ourselves
[1:38:40] where our mind likes to trick us that we
[1:38:43] are doing everything right
[1:38:48] we're doing everything right
[1:38:51] but yet we're disbelieving some promise
[1:38:54] that God has given to us
[1:38:59] and when we find ourselves in a place of
[1:39:01] unbelief
[1:39:03] we will generally
[1:39:05] find ourselves going down a wrong path
[1:39:10] it's just like a leadership uh
[1:39:15] an exit ramp to uh
[1:39:18] to a wrong path
[1:39:22] but if we confess our sins
[1:39:25] he is faithful and just to forgive us
[1:39:27] our sins
[1:39:29] and to cleanse us from all
[1:39:31] unrighteousness
[1:39:32] he gives us further instruction if you
[1:39:35] repent
[1:39:36] you're baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:39:39] Christ for the remission of your sins
[1:39:41] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:39:44] Ghost Acts 2 38. how
[1:39:47] we know that Matthew 28 19 says be
[1:39:52] baptized in the name
[1:39:56] Acts 2 reveals the name
[1:40:00] that at the name of Jesus
[1:40:04] every knee should bow every tongue
[1:40:07] should confess
[1:40:13] in the name
[1:40:15] repent and be baptized in the name
[1:40:19] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:40:22] he revealed his name it no longer has to
[1:40:25] be titles he revealed his name and when
[1:40:28] he gave his name he gave his name so
[1:40:31] powerfully that at that name
[1:40:34] every knee has to bow
[1:40:37] every tongue has to comp confess that he
[1:40:40] is Lord
[1:40:43] that name there's no name higher than
[1:40:45] that name
[1:40:50] all the family in heaven
[1:40:53] an earth
[1:40:55] named
[1:40:56] after that name
[1:40:58] now he also gave us
[1:41:01] in that in his promise to us
[1:41:05] in his oath to us
[1:41:08] part of that
[1:41:11] um
[1:41:13] the give a gift that he gave when he
[1:41:16] went to the Cross was
[1:41:18] salvation sanctification the baptism of
[1:41:21] the Holy Ghost but he also gave the
[1:41:23] healing of our bodies
[1:41:25] yes
[1:41:28] it was part of the atonement
[1:41:31] when he gave himself at Calvary part of
[1:41:35] that atonement was for the healing of
[1:41:37] our bodies for even here unto were ye
[1:41:40] called because Christ also suffered for
[1:41:43] us this is First Peter chapter 2 verse
[1:41:45] 21. he suffered for us leaving us an
[1:41:48] example that we should follow his steps
[1:41:52] who did no sin neither was guile found
[1:41:56] in his mouth
[1:41:57] who when he was reviled he reviled not
[1:42:00] again when he suffered he threatened not
[1:42:04] but he committed himself to him that
[1:42:06] judges righteously who his own self bear
[1:42:12] our sins in his own body on the tree
[1:42:15] that we being dead to sins should live
[1:42:19] unto righteousness
[1:42:21] by whose stripes
[1:42:24] you were healed
[1:42:30] healing
[1:42:32] was not just yesterday
[1:42:34] healing is today healing is tomorrow it
[1:42:37] is part of the atonement that was given
[1:42:39] to us
[1:42:40] he also told us in John 14 let not your
[1:42:44] heart believe it be troubled you believe
[1:42:46] in God believes also in me in my
[1:42:49] father's house are many mansions if it
[1:42:52] were not so I would have told you
[1:42:55] I go to prepare a place for you
[1:42:58] and if I go and prepare a place for you
[1:43:01] I will come again and receive you unto
[1:43:04] myself
[1:43:05] that where I am you may be also
[1:43:11] we have
[1:43:14] for many years had this
[1:43:17] Earthly concept of a mansion
[1:43:24] streets of gold these Mansions we're
[1:43:28] going to have all of these rooms and we
[1:43:30] talk about this mansion that we can
[1:43:32] conjure up in our mind with an Earthly
[1:43:35] mentality
[1:43:38] and
[1:43:40] every one of us talk about this mansion
[1:43:43] that we're going to go live in
[1:43:45] with all these rooms and all these gold
[1:43:47] fixtures and uh
[1:43:49] you're going to live there by yourself
[1:43:55] you got all these rooms
[1:43:58] what are you gonna do with them
[1:44:01] but I've got a mansion that's waiting
[1:44:03] for me
[1:44:06] this Shack that I live in
[1:44:09] I'm Gonna Leave it behind
[1:44:11] and I've Got a Mansion one that's beyond
[1:44:14] all of my imagination
[1:44:18] that is waiting for me when I step into
[1:44:21] that new body
[1:44:23] I'm not going to care about what I can
[1:44:26] think about down here
[1:44:28] what people call mansion that they're
[1:44:31] trying to sell and they can't get their
[1:44:32] value out of
[1:44:34] because it's got too many rooms for two
[1:44:37] people
[1:44:39] they want rid of it because it's too
[1:44:42] much too much upkeep
[1:44:45] but I've got a new body waiting for me
[1:44:48] over there and I'm not going to care
[1:44:49] about all of the mansions that are down
[1:44:52] here the the the idea of the Mansion
[1:44:55] down here with all of its upkeep I'm
[1:44:57] going to have a new body I'm going to
[1:44:59] have a mansion that's not going to need
[1:45:02] upkeep like these Mansions down here
[1:45:05] not going to have a body that has a
[1:45:08] bunch of upkeep like a half right here
[1:45:10] I'm gonna have a new body
[1:45:13] all of these promises were given to us
[1:45:16] through the gift of the word of God and
[1:45:18] He swore it by himself he went to
[1:45:21] Calvary himself he didn't send somebody
[1:45:24] else he did it himself
[1:45:27] because he wanted to make sure the
[1:45:29] promise was delivered
[1:45:33] don't ever
[1:45:35] let yourself have the mindset of the
[1:45:39] world
[1:45:42] God doesn't keep his promises 20 years
[1:45:45] have gone by
[1:45:46] and he didn't accomplish what he said he
[1:45:49] was going to accomplish
[1:45:56] I often wonder about the people through
[1:45:59] the scripture because
[1:46:01] the the Bible teaches us
[1:46:03] that if a prophet prophesies and it
[1:46:07] doesn't come to pass
[1:46:09] he should be stoned
[1:46:12] but I have often wondered
[1:46:15] how many people wanted to Stone Isaiah
[1:46:23] because Isaiah was dead and gone off the
[1:46:26] scene
[1:46:27] many many years before his prophecy was
[1:46:31] fulfilled
[1:46:34] some of these other prophecies that we
[1:46:36] see in the scripture
[1:46:38] and their ongoing prophecy there they
[1:46:41] they were fulfilled once upon a time but
[1:46:43] there's there's a repeat of them but
[1:46:45] wonder what people thought with some of
[1:46:48] these men
[1:46:50] and wonder if they really wanted to
[1:46:53] Stone I wonder if some of them didn't go
[1:46:56] to the high priest and say this man
[1:46:57] prophesied and it ain't come to pass
[1:46:59] it's been 10 years and it hasn't come to
[1:47:01] pass I think we ought to take him out
[1:47:03] and stone him
[1:47:08] we also have to remember that a prophet
[1:47:12] is a human being
[1:47:14] and that he is prophesying with what he
[1:47:18] has knowledge of at the moment
[1:47:26] perhaps Jeremiah did not see modern day
[1:47:30] automobiles in his vision
[1:47:32] they talked about carriages jostling in
[1:47:35] the streets
[1:47:40] do you think he saw a 2023 Mercedes-Benz
[1:47:43] going down the road
[1:47:45] and crashing into a
[1:47:49] 2009 Ford Escape
[1:47:53] probably not because he was prophesying
[1:47:56] with what he knew
[1:48:01] and as things change over the years
[1:48:06] then we start saying oh that was false
[1:48:08] prophecy no it was prophesying according
[1:48:11] to what he knew at the time
[1:48:13] with the with the I I mean a man has got
[1:48:17] a got a
[1:48:18] he only has a limited understanding and
[1:48:22] he's trying to reach in from one realm
[1:48:25] and bring it into the Earthly realm and
[1:48:27] speak it
[1:48:31] I'm not trying to I'm not trying to
[1:48:36] say that there aren't false prophets I
[1:48:39] think there's a whole lot of people that
[1:48:40] prophesy that prophesy out of their soul
[1:48:46] I think there are a lot of people who
[1:48:48] watch too much television
[1:48:52] spend too many hours watching news
[1:48:54] cycles and then prophesy out of what you
[1:48:57] know it's there's a mixture
[1:49:00] and so then that mixture gets into the
[1:49:03] church system and people are you know
[1:49:06] and it's constant it's constant
[1:49:09] off of that and on to other things
[1:49:12] the promise of the word of God has been
[1:49:15] given to us
[1:49:16] God came down himself
[1:49:18] and he
[1:49:20] took on him the form of sinful flesh
[1:49:23] died at Calvary and delivered it to us
[1:49:26] and it is an ongoing prophecy to us that
[1:49:29] we can have salvation we can have the
[1:49:32] promise of the Holy Ghost in our lives
[1:49:34] today it wasn't just for those in the
[1:49:37] old in in on the day of Pentecost it was
[1:49:41] for us today it belongs to us because we
[1:49:44] are Heirs of the promise
[1:49:46] God saw by that prefix destiny that we
[1:49:50] would desire this promise and that we
[1:49:53] would fight for it as Abraham did and so
[1:49:56] he could give us the the the gift of
[1:50:00] that promise and know that he had sealed
[1:50:03] it with his own blood at Calvary that he
[1:50:06] delivered it to us and that it was good
[1:50:08] enough to last all of these years up to
[1:50:11] current Day Jesus Christ himself being
[1:50:14] the same yesterday and today and forever
[1:50:19] well we've due out a whole long time on
[1:50:21] one verse
[1:50:24] even from the days of your fathers
[1:50:27] you're gone away from mine ordinances
[1:50:30] and have not kept them we're in verse 7
[1:50:32] now of Malachi chapter 3.
[1:50:35] return unto me and I will return unto
[1:50:38] you saith the Lord of hosts
[1:50:40] but you have said
[1:50:42] wherein shall re we return
[1:50:46] now when we read verse 7
[1:50:50] he is speaking to a generation but he is
[1:50:54] saying even from the days of your
[1:50:56] fathers
[1:50:58] you are gone away from mine ordinances
[1:51:01] now this appears to be a
[1:51:03] multi-generational falling away or a
[1:51:06] multi-generational disregard for the
[1:51:09] word of God
[1:51:13] and
[1:51:15] somewhere
[1:51:17] there was a first generation
[1:51:20] [Music]
[1:51:21] who said I don't have to do this
[1:51:30] and so most probably
[1:51:33] that first generation who said all those
[1:51:38] rules and regulation that Moses gave to
[1:51:41] us it's a bunch of nonsense I'm going to
[1:51:42] live my life the way I want to and so
[1:51:45] out of a out of a heart of rebellion
[1:51:47] that first generation decided that they
[1:51:50] were going to wander away
[1:51:54] that may not have been their thought
[1:51:56] process I'm just going to step away from
[1:51:59] all of this teaching
[1:52:01] there was a mind process
[1:52:04] that calls them to say
[1:52:07] all of that stringent process that Moses
[1:52:12] told us we had to be a part of
[1:52:14] I just don't see that it's necessary
[1:52:17] anymore we live in a modern age why do
[1:52:21] we have to do it
[1:52:23] and so that
[1:52:26] generation
[1:52:28] out of rebellion walked away from the
[1:52:32] Covenant of the Lord
[1:52:35] then
[1:52:36] there as the Next Generation came their
[1:52:40] children then they decided
[1:52:43] either not to tell their children about
[1:52:46] all of this nonsense that Moses made us
[1:52:49] do
[1:52:52] or else they
[1:52:55] said
[1:52:57] you know
[1:52:59] we were once a part of that church over
[1:53:02] there
[1:53:03] and that church over there
[1:53:05] they had such strict rules
[1:53:08] they had so many things that we just
[1:53:12] couldn't keep up with all them the
[1:53:14] priests were all the time down our
[1:53:16] throat because we weren't doing this
[1:53:17] right and we weren't doing that right
[1:53:19] and we just got tired of the priest
[1:53:21] being down our neck all the time telling
[1:53:23] us how wrong we were in the way we were
[1:53:24] doing them and we just got tired of
[1:53:26] hearing it so we just decided we weren't
[1:53:28] going to do it no more
[1:53:31] generational
[1:53:36] we as parents can either teach our
[1:53:39] children the truths of the word of God
[1:53:41] and stand by them
[1:53:45] or by our words and actions
[1:53:48] we can take them down a wrong path
[1:53:54] Deuteronomy chapter 6 verse 6 through
[1:53:58] 15.
[1:54:00] and these words which I command thee
[1:54:03] this day shall be in thine heart
[1:54:06] and thou shalt teach them diligently
[1:54:10] to thy children
[1:54:12] and shall talk of them when thou sittest
[1:54:15] in thine house
[1:54:18] and when thou walkest by the way
[1:54:21] and when you lie down
[1:54:24] and when you rise up
[1:54:28] and you shall bind them for a sign upon
[1:54:31] thine hand and they shall be as
[1:54:32] frontlets between thine eyes and thou
[1:54:35] shall write them upon the posts of thine
[1:54:37] house
[1:54:38] on thy Gates
[1:54:41] and it shall be when the Lord thy God
[1:54:43] shall have brought thee into the land
[1:54:45] which he swear to the fathers to Abraham
[1:54:47] to Isaac and to Jacob to give the great
[1:54:50] and goodly cities which thou build us
[1:54:52] not and houses full of all good things
[1:54:55] which thou fillest not and Wells digged
[1:54:58] which you didn't dig Vineyards and olive
[1:55:01] trees which you didn't plant when you
[1:55:03] shall have eaten and be full
[1:55:06] then beware
[1:55:09] lest I'll forget the Lord which brought
[1:55:12] thee forth out of the land of Egypt from
[1:55:13] the house of bondage
[1:55:16] Thou shalt fear the lord thy God and
[1:55:18] serve him and shall swear by his name
[1:55:19] you shall not go after other gods of the
[1:55:22] Gods of the people which are around
[1:55:24] about you for the Lord
[1:55:26] thy God is a jealous God among you
[1:55:29] lest the anger of the Lord thy God be
[1:55:32] kindled against thee and Destroy thee
[1:55:35] from off of the face of the Earth
[1:55:38] let's bring this up to Modern to today
[1:55:43] the Lord our God is a jealous God
[1:55:46] he won't share his glory with another
[1:55:51] and he is jealous over you
[1:55:55] he is jealous over you
[1:55:58] and there have been times in our lives
[1:56:02] where we
[1:56:05] we have allowed the circumstances of
[1:56:09] life
[1:56:10] to draw us away from the Commandments of
[1:56:14] the Lord
[1:56:16] but because he is jealous over you I'm
[1:56:19] bringing it back to this prefix Destiny
[1:56:22] because he is jealous over you the way
[1:56:25] he was jealous over Abraham even though
[1:56:28] Abraham it looks like made mistakes even
[1:56:31] though it looks like you make mistakes
[1:56:33] God is jealous over his promise
[1:56:36] you are the promise
[1:56:39] and God is jealous over his promise
[1:56:42] you are a word sent from God and you
[1:56:45] will not return unto him void
[1:56:48] and so he's jealous over the promise and
[1:56:51] so he's continually yes there are times
[1:56:55] maybe that it seems like he's got angry
[1:56:57] but it's only because he's jealous over
[1:57:00] the promise and he's trying to get you
[1:57:02] back in the right path
[1:57:10] so he tells us his parents to teach our
[1:57:14] children
[1:57:15] teach them
[1:57:16] when you're in the house teach them when
[1:57:19] you're walking down the sidewalk teach
[1:57:21] them
[1:57:22] when you're when you're lying down to go
[1:57:25] to sleep teach them when you rise up
[1:57:27] teach them
[1:57:30] it's the responsibility of a parent to
[1:57:33] teach their children about the good
[1:57:35] things of the Lord about the the uh all
[1:57:38] of the promises all of the things in the
[1:57:41] word of God it's the the part of the
[1:57:44] parent to teach the children
[1:57:47] there is no way that two Services a week
[1:57:51] is all the training that your children
[1:57:54] need
[1:57:56] two Services a week is not all the
[1:57:58] training I need
[1:58:01] I need to be in training in
[1:58:06] forward momentum when I'm in the house
[1:58:09] when I'm going down the sidewalk
[1:58:10] meditating on the things of God let them
[1:58:14] be as frontlets between your eyes let
[1:58:17] the word hide the word in your heart
[1:58:19] that you may not sin against the Lord
[1:58:22] God now you may not be able to memorize
[1:58:24] the whole Bible but you can take a
[1:58:27] phrase of a promise and you can meditate
[1:58:30] on it going down the road you can take
[1:58:32] one scripture and you can meditate on it
[1:58:35] if you can't remember any Scripture you
[1:58:37] can go down the road just thanking the
[1:58:40] Lord because that he has brought you out
[1:58:42] of Darkness right into the light of the
[1:58:45] goodness and gospel of the goodness of
[1:58:47] the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:58:51] and as parents
[1:58:54] we teach it to our children
[1:58:56] as Grandparents we continue to teach it
[1:59:00] to our children
[1:59:03] we want to be Godly Parents we want to
[1:59:07] be Godly grandparents we want to be
[1:59:10] Godly great grandparents because we want
[1:59:13] this to be a multi-generational blessing
[1:59:16] that follows us through the course of
[1:59:19] history we want this to go on and on and
[1:59:23] on that our children and our children's
[1:59:25] children and their children continue to
[1:59:29] hold to the promise even though even
[1:59:31] though it seems like 600 years ago that
[1:59:34] Isaiah prophesied it I won my children
[1:59:37] and their children and their children to
[1:59:40] say the promises of God are still yes
[1:59:43] and there's still a man
[1:59:48] do not want my children and my
[1:59:50] grandchildren my great-grandchildren
[1:59:51] should I be on this Earth long enough
[1:59:53] for that I don't want them to ever say
[1:59:57] grandpa I don't know why you're waiting
[1:59:59] around for
[2:00:01] that promise that one's long gone
[2:00:05] no
[2:00:06] I want there to be a generational faith
[2:00:11] a generational Faith a faith that was
[2:00:15] passed from my father to me from me to
[2:00:18] my children and now my children to their
[2:00:21] children this is a faith that is being
[2:00:23] passed on generation to generation but
[2:00:26] in this instance God comes to these
[2:00:29] people and he said from the days of your
[2:00:32] fathers You're Gone Gone Away from mine
[2:00:34] ordinances and not kept them and then he
[2:00:37] offers them something returned to me
[2:00:40] return unto me and I will return unto
[2:00:43] you saith the Lord of hosts
[2:00:51] their answer
[2:00:54] was a question
[2:00:57] in what way shall we return
[2:01:04] in what way shall we return
[2:01:08] God gives them an answer to their
[2:01:11] question
[2:01:12] with a question
[2:01:14] will a man rob God
[2:01:18] yet you have robbed me
[2:01:23] sorry this is just part of the chapter
[2:01:28] in what way shall we return
[2:01:31] where have we gone off the track
[2:01:35] what is it going to take to get us back
[2:01:38] in line with the promises that have been
[2:01:43] made to us God says to them
[2:01:47] return to me
[2:01:50] and the people responded
[2:01:52] what do we got to do to return
[2:01:56] and God says you've robbed me
[2:01:59] and they said how have we robbed you and
[2:02:02] God's answer was in tithe tithes and
[2:02:07] offerings
[2:02:09] Now by robbing God of tithe and
[2:02:13] offerings
[2:02:16] they and we
[2:02:19] disrupt God's order
[2:02:26] if you ever look at your tithe or your
[2:02:30] offering as giving money to a church
[2:02:33] you are going to end up in a place
[2:02:37] at some point in your life where you're
[2:02:40] aggravated
[2:02:42] with the church or with the leadership
[2:02:46] and you're going to be angry some way
[2:02:49] and you're gonna say I'm going to
[2:02:50] withhold my tithe
[2:02:52] and withhold my offering don't like the
[2:02:54] way they're doing that I'm not giving
[2:02:56] anything but you are disrupting God's
[2:02:59] order
[2:03:00] what do I mean with that in the Old
[2:03:03] Testament
[2:03:10] s that were in uh they were to keep
[2:03:14] order in the Tabernacle
[2:03:16] we remember we go back to the time of
[2:03:18] Moses and Moses comes down off of the
[2:03:20] mountain and there's a bunch of Chaos in
[2:03:23] the camp because Moses had been gone a
[2:03:25] long time and and then he says who Moses
[2:03:28] comes into the camp and there's the
[2:03:30] golden calf he says who is on the Lord's
[2:03:32] Side
[2:03:33] there was this group of men that come to
[2:03:35] him they were the Levites then because
[2:03:38] originally it was supposed to be the
[2:03:41] firstborn that were to be uh keepers of
[2:03:45] the Tabernacle but because of what
[2:03:48] happened in the camp under the
[2:03:50] leadership of Aaron God changed it and
[2:03:53] he said the Levites were to have the
[2:03:55] oversight of the Tabernacle and then God
[2:03:59] said they're not to work
[2:04:03] they are to be keepers of the Tabernacle
[2:04:06] they're going to watch over all of the
[2:04:09] aspects of the Tabernacle and they do
[2:04:11] not get any inheritance their
[2:04:13] inheritance is in the things of God
[2:04:18] then God tells the people bring your
[2:04:21] tithe
[2:04:23] and your tithe is what is going to
[2:04:25] support the Levites
[2:04:29] then you bring your offerings in all of
[2:04:31] these offerings that you bring the
[2:04:34] Levites are hands on with them
[2:04:39] imagine all the blood
[2:04:43] all of the animals
[2:04:45] all of the Skins all of the bones
[2:04:49] all of the meat
[2:04:51] all of the stink
[2:04:53] all of the Flies buzzing around because
[2:04:56] there's so much blood
[2:05:01] I want you to get a picture of what the
[2:05:04] priest dealt with
[2:05:10] they weren't lazy
[2:05:13] they had a hard hard work
[2:05:16] that they were to do
[2:05:19] now just suppose
[2:05:23] there was about
[2:05:25] three quarters
[2:05:28] I'm making it a big number because I
[2:05:30] want you to really get a picture here
[2:05:32] about three quarters of the nation of
[2:05:34] Israel said
[2:05:37] I don't really like the priests I don't
[2:05:38] like the way they're doing things
[2:05:41] don't like Moses don't like Aaron
[2:05:44] don't like the way that
[2:05:47] I I really don't want to go to the
[2:05:49] Tabernacle area because it's smelly it's
[2:05:52] bloody
[2:05:54] there's too much noise
[2:05:57] all of these things are going on and the
[2:05:59] people decide that they're not going to
[2:06:01] bring their offerings
[2:06:04] and they're not going to bring their
[2:06:05] tithe
[2:06:09] what was the purpose of the Levites
[2:06:16] their purpose was to offer
[2:06:19] the offerings to the Lord
[2:06:27] a man as an individual
[2:06:29] was not authorized to do it himself
[2:06:34] and so the priest
[2:06:36] was that
[2:06:39] the priest's plural in the Tabernacle
[2:06:43] Arena they were the ones that were
[2:06:46] constantly checking to see if the
[2:06:48] sacrifice was clean if it was good and
[2:06:51] bring it in and Slaughter it and and
[2:06:54] take care of it and offer it to the Lord
[2:06:57] that was their job
[2:07:00] so I want you to see these priests as
[2:07:03] intercessors
[2:07:07] they were intercessors
[2:07:09] on behalf of the people
[2:07:12] so if the people decided I don't want to
[2:07:14] take my offering I'm not going to give
[2:07:16] my tithe to support the Levites I really
[2:07:19] don't want I don't like the way they
[2:07:21] handle things and so I'm going to
[2:07:23] withhold my time and if enough of them
[2:07:24] did then what happens
[2:07:27] the priests are starving
[2:07:30] and the priests are not doing the work
[2:07:32] of the intercessor
[2:07:36] you're disrupting the plan of God
[2:07:45] now if
[2:07:47] we as Believers in 2023
[2:07:52] withhold our tithe and our offering
[2:07:55] because we're mad at the preacher we
[2:07:57] don't like the way things are done we
[2:07:59] don't like how money is handled we don't
[2:08:01] like any of that stuff if we get our
[2:08:03] mind on money
[2:08:07] rather than this is an offering to the
[2:08:10] Lord
[2:08:11] I am keeping Covenant with the Lord than
[2:08:15] you or I am disrupting the plan of God
[2:08:19] by withholding our tithes by withholding
[2:08:21] our offering we're disrupting the plan
[2:08:23] of God and we're actually removing the
[2:08:27] intercession
[2:08:29] out of our lives
[2:08:32] God gave the fivefold ministry for the
[2:08:35] perfecting of the Saints
[2:08:37] and the fivefold ministry was given so
[2:08:40] that there could be a form of
[2:08:42] intercession I know that there are
[2:08:44] intercessors as as far as lay members
[2:08:46] but God has a divine order he chose the
[2:08:49] foolishness of preaching he chose the
[2:08:51] five-fold ministry that was his choosing
[2:08:54] and he chose for them to be supported in
[2:08:57] the same way by tithe and by offering
[2:09:00] and if we should get it in our mind that
[2:09:03] this is just money or we don't like the
[2:09:06] way that this is done or that's done and
[2:09:08] we withhold it we're removing the
[2:09:10] intercession uh for our own lives
[2:09:14] and we don't want to be found doing that
[2:09:19] we've been taught in this day that
[2:09:21] tithing
[2:09:23] should be
[2:09:25] given where that we get our food
[2:09:29] and when God begins to pour out his
[2:09:33] Blessing God is telling these people you
[2:09:36] have robbed me
[2:09:38] and because that you have withheld your
[2:09:42] tithe and you're offering that you are
[2:09:45] robbing him
[2:09:48] he gave them the answer in the way that
[2:09:51] they were robbing him
[2:09:53] it was a big deal to God
[2:09:58] he wanted the Levites to be taken care
[2:10:02] of
[2:10:03] he wanted them to be in their positions
[2:10:07] every one of us need to be in our
[2:10:09] position in Christ
[2:10:12] if we're not called to preach the gospel
[2:10:16] we can pray we can sing we can help to
[2:10:19] bring atmosphere we all have a part to
[2:10:22] play
[2:10:22] and the tithe was never ours to start
[2:10:25] with it was his
[2:10:29] that's why he said you're robbing me
[2:10:33] but he didn't just leave it at tithe he
[2:10:35] said in offerings too
[2:10:39] we don't always understand
[2:10:42] uh all of these things yet God has an
[2:10:45] order that he has put the church in in
[2:10:48] the in the end time to be able to follow
[2:10:50] these things because he really wants to
[2:10:53] pour you out a blessing that you cannot
[2:10:56] receive
[2:10:57] one that you don't have the capacity to
[2:11:00] contain
[2:11:04] and so
[2:11:05] when you rob God
[2:11:08] you're cutting off your own blessing
[2:11:11] and who wants to cut off their own
[2:11:13] blessing nobody wants to cut off their
[2:11:15] own blessing but when they get in a in a
[2:11:18] state where that they are
[2:11:21] muddled-minded
[2:11:24] and they
[2:11:27] get this idea in their head
[2:11:31] that
[2:11:33] I don't like that I don't like that why
[2:11:37] do we have to do it this way
[2:11:42] this is the way that the enemy uses
[2:11:46] he uses it
[2:11:49] then people say I can't afford to pay
[2:11:51] tithe
[2:11:57] brings me back to the story of my own
[2:11:59] father
[2:12:01] and somebody
[2:12:02] asked him how he could afford to pay
[2:12:05] tithe and he says I can't afford not to
[2:12:08] there was something in him that he had a
[2:12:10] revelation that the blessings of God
[2:12:13] would be cut off if he chose
[2:12:16] to keep God's part for himself to pay a
[2:12:20] bill
[2:12:21] then a few weeks ago we talked about the
[2:12:24] devil's tithe
[2:12:30] football tickets baseball tickets
[2:12:34] eyeliner lipstick
[2:12:36] fake fingernails
[2:12:39] hair stylings tattoos jewelry
[2:12:44] cigarettes alcohol gambling
[2:12:59] robbery
[2:13:02] goes down the path
[2:13:05] you rob God
[2:13:08] and God pulls the blessing off of you
[2:13:13] the devil's gonna rob you
[2:13:19] because he's a thief
[2:13:23] he comes to steal to kill and to destroy
[2:13:33] and so if you don't pay your tithe if
[2:13:36] you don't give your tithe I I I don't
[2:13:38] like that phraseology
[2:13:41] because I'm not paying my tithes
[2:13:45] I'm giving God what belongs to him
[2:13:49] not really paying anything
[2:13:54] I'm giving to him what belongs to him
[2:13:56] and then I'm bringing an offering extra
[2:13:59] on top of that because that is how the
[2:14:02] blessing of God comes in our life and if
[2:14:05] we try to Rob him as they did and God
[2:14:08] beckoned them back
[2:14:11] and he told them you're cursed with a
[2:14:13] curse for you've robbed me even this
[2:14:16] whole nation has robbed me
[2:14:19] he told him to bring the tithe into the
[2:14:21] storehouse so that there would be meat
[2:14:24] in my house and then he gives an offer
[2:14:27] to them
[2:14:29] prove me
[2:14:32] prove me now herewith saith the Lord
[2:14:36] prove me examine
[2:14:40] try
[2:14:41] to prove
[2:14:44] prove me
[2:14:46] if I will not open you the windows of
[2:14:50] heaven and pour out a blessing and there
[2:14:52] not be enough room
[2:14:54] to receive it
[2:14:58] prove me
[2:15:00] examine me
[2:15:02] see if
[2:15:03] when you keep your part of what I've
[2:15:07] requested see if I will not pour you out
[2:15:10] a blessing and there not be room enough
[2:15:13] to receive it
[2:15:19] we get these over analytical Minds
[2:15:26] that say
[2:15:30] I've been able to receive everything
[2:15:32] I've ever gotten
[2:15:39] he has gone so far above and beyond for
[2:15:44] us
[2:15:46] when we should have been dead
[2:15:49] he kept us
[2:15:52] when we were rebellious
[2:15:55] he could have
[2:15:57] done so much
[2:16:00] to cause us inflicted pain it would have
[2:16:03] been well within his rights to do it
[2:16:05] because we were rebellious
[2:16:07] but yet he brings us back into line he
[2:16:11] brings us back into line and he allows
[2:16:14] the blessings of God to come down over
[2:16:16] us and there have been seasons of our
[2:16:20] time where that we have received
[2:16:22] blessing from him that we didn't know
[2:16:25] what to do with
[2:16:30] we just didn't know
[2:16:33] how to respond to the blessing that we
[2:16:35] were getting
[2:16:37] we always think Financial
[2:16:40] and that's not the only way that
[2:16:42] blessing comes to us
[2:16:45] he comes with blessing to us even the
[2:16:48] blessing of him letting us see unbelief
[2:16:52] in our life to get it out
[2:16:57] now why is this this is because there's
[2:17:00] a divine order
[2:17:02] and there is intercession that is going
[2:17:05] on
[2:17:06] on our behalf at all times there's
[2:17:09] intercession going on till that God is
[2:17:12] allowing things to happen in our lives
[2:17:15] to bring the correction in our lives
[2:17:17] that we need and though it may not feel
[2:17:20] good at the moment this is a blessing
[2:17:22] that we really need in our lives because
[2:17:25] when we really examine our hearts our
[2:17:29] desire is that we are so right before
[2:17:31] the Lord
[2:17:33] perfect in his sight
[2:17:37] perfect and steadfast and not wavering
[2:17:40] from any of his promises that's what we
[2:17:42] really want
[2:17:45] what are you going to do with a thousand
[2:17:47] mules
[2:17:49] thousand camels
[2:17:50] what are you going to do with a fleet of
[2:17:52] Cadillacs
[2:17:54] or Mercedes or BMWs or whatever it is
[2:17:57] you want
[2:17:58] what are you going to do with a 10 room
[2:18:01] mansion in 14 bathrooms in a pool house
[2:18:03] in a guest house what are you going to
[2:18:05] do with it
[2:18:08] when you leave here you can't take it
[2:18:11] with you
[2:18:14] there is only one thing that you get to
[2:18:16] take when you leave here
[2:18:23] that is your redeemed
[2:18:26] spirit
[2:18:31] it's all you're taking with you
[2:18:36] you have a new body prepared
[2:18:40] you sure don't want to take this one
[2:18:42] with you
[2:18:47] what good is a piece of gold from planet
[2:18:49] Earth going to do you
[2:18:51] in a new Heaven and a new Earth
[2:18:58] what good is a
[2:19:01] automobile gonna do you
[2:19:04] if you could take it with you
[2:19:10] it'd be worthless in Heaven's frequency
[2:19:16] he's poured out a blessing on us
[2:19:19] and continues to pour out the blessing
[2:19:21] on us that we don't have room enough to
[2:19:23] receive it
[2:19:25] then he goes on in verse 11 I'm going to
[2:19:27] wind down here
[2:19:28] I will rebuke the Devourer for your
[2:19:31] sakes
[2:19:35] the Devourer
[2:19:37] eats
[2:19:39] devours
[2:19:41] consumes and wastes
[2:19:45] I will rebuke the Devourer for your
[2:19:48] sakes and he shall not destroy the
[2:19:51] fruits of your ground
[2:19:53] neither shall your Vine cast her fruit
[2:19:56] before the time in the field
[2:19:59] saith the Lord of hosts
[2:20:08] All Nations shall call you blessed for
[2:20:11] you shall be a delightsome land saith
[2:20:13] the Lord of hosts
[2:20:14] now the Devourer is constantly out to
[2:20:17] destroy
[2:20:19] always
[2:20:23] as a roaring lion
[2:20:25] he comes to Devour the enemy
[2:20:31] there is this promise that we have in
[2:20:34] the word that if we will do our part in
[2:20:38] giving of our tithe and offering if we
[2:20:40] uh do our part in responding to him till
[2:20:45] that we're not robbing him he said that
[2:20:48] he was going to rebuke the Devourer for
[2:20:51] your sakes and he shall just he shall
[2:20:54] not destroy the fruits of your grounds
[2:20:57] now in Exodus chapter 23 verses 23
[2:21:02] through 30.
[2:21:04] for mine angel
[2:21:07] shall go before thee this is the
[2:21:09] children of Israel a promise from the
[2:21:11] Lord for the children of Israel
[2:21:13] he said for mine Angel shall go before
[2:21:15] thee and bring thee in unto the amorites
[2:21:17] and the Hittites
[2:21:19] and the parasites the Canaanites the
[2:21:23] hivites and the jebusites and I will cut
[2:21:25] them off thou shall not bow down to
[2:21:28] their gods nor serve them nor do after
[2:21:31] their works but thou shall utterly
[2:21:33] overthrow them and quite break down
[2:21:36] their images
[2:21:37] and you shall serve the Lord your God
[2:21:40] and he shall bless your bread
[2:21:43] and your water
[2:21:45] and I will take sickness away from the
[2:21:49] midst of Thee
[2:21:50] now this is part of the newer Covenant
[2:21:53] this part of the atonement
[2:21:55] taking sickness away by whose stripes we
[2:22:00] were healed
[2:22:04] then he says in verse 26 there shall
[2:22:06] nothing cast their young
[2:22:11] no sheep
[2:22:13] no cow
[2:22:15] no Ox no goat no human
[2:22:20] there shall nothing cast their young nor
[2:22:23] be barren
[2:22:25] in thy land the number of thy days I
[2:22:29] will fulfill I will send my fear before
[2:22:32] thee and will destroy all of the people
[2:22:34] to whom thou shall come and I will make
[2:22:36] thine enemies turn their backs unto thee
[2:22:39] and I'll send Hornets before thee which
[2:22:42] shall drive out the Highlight the
[2:22:45] Canaanite the hittite from before thee
[2:22:47] and he goes on to say I'm not going to
[2:22:49] drive him out in a year lest you can't
[2:22:51] occupy the land but little by little but
[2:22:54] this is a promise not only for the corn
[2:22:58] and the beans and the the vine the the
[2:23:01] fruit on the vine or the fruit trees but
[2:23:05] this is a promise that God made that
[2:23:08] there should be none that would cast
[2:23:10] their young
[2:23:12] now for a lady a miscarriage is a
[2:23:16] horrible horrible thing
[2:23:19] and I don't want to get on a sensitive
[2:23:21] subject here
[2:23:24] miscarriage is horrible
[2:23:29] yet I believe that there is a promise in
[2:23:33] the word of God that we can lay hold to
[2:23:38] I believe this is a promise for the
[2:23:40] elect lady
[2:23:43] that there doesn't have to be
[2:23:44] miscarriage
[2:23:46] I don't understand all of the ways of
[2:23:48] God
[2:23:49] don't understand why he chooses to do
[2:23:52] that sometimes
[2:23:53] but I'm seeing a promise in the word of
[2:23:56] God that he said he was going to rebuke
[2:23:59] the Devourer for our sake
[2:24:03] and he told that to them after he's
[2:24:06] rebuking them because they have robbed
[2:24:09] him but if they were willing to restore
[2:24:12] to him what belonged to him and get all
[2:24:15] of the intercession back in its rightful
[2:24:18] place all of the divine order back in
[2:24:20] its place he's saying that you just
[2:24:23] watch and see if I won't pour you out of
[2:24:26] blessing that you will not have room
[2:24:29] enough to receive and I will destroy the
[2:24:33] deviled rebuke the devour for your sake
[2:24:36] and he shall not destroy the fruit of
[2:24:39] your ground neither shall your Vine cast
[2:24:42] our fruit before the time
[2:24:45] I believe this is a promise that we
[2:24:47] should be able to hold on to
[2:24:49] because if if we're in Covenant with God
[2:24:53] the way that we're supposed to be
[2:24:57] and if I am reading this if I'm
[2:24:59] comprehending this scripture
[2:25:02] right here
[2:25:04] that he was telling them they were
[2:25:07] robbing him
[2:25:09] and in essence they were robbing their
[2:25:11] own blessing
[2:25:13] by withholding their tithe and their
[2:25:15] offering but if they were willing to
[2:25:18] restore to God what belonged to him
[2:25:21] see this is not just about money people
[2:25:28] this is about offering our whole self to
[2:25:31] the Lord
[2:25:34] our tithe and our offering and not just
[2:25:38] money
[2:25:40] but our entire self to the Lord Jesus
[2:25:43] Christ
[2:25:46] when it looks like
[2:25:48] that there's chaos and loss
[2:25:53] as it was with Abraham
[2:25:56] as it has been in your life
[2:25:59] when it looks like the Devourer has come
[2:26:02] in
[2:26:03] and he has
[2:26:05] gotten the upper hand in your life
[2:26:09] what did Abraham do
[2:26:11] did he run away from God
[2:26:14] Abraham always came back to God
[2:26:18] and at the appointed time when Abraham
[2:26:21] came back to God
[2:26:23] El Shaddai showed up
[2:26:31] the breasted God
[2:26:33] and how many times did we hear Brother
[2:26:35] Branham say we just need to lay our head
[2:26:37] on his bosom and nurse strength from El
[2:26:40] Shaddai
[2:26:42] and when we feel that fear feeling of
[2:26:46] failure
[2:26:47] when we know that we've gone astray
[2:26:52] when we know that we have uh exhibited
[2:26:57] attributes of unbelief
[2:27:00] and God comes to us and he says to us
[2:27:04] come back near to me
[2:27:07] you're robbing me
[2:27:11] what do you mean Lord I'm robbing you I
[2:27:13] pay my tithe
[2:27:17] but you're robbing me
[2:27:20] you're robbing me of your time you're
[2:27:23] robbing me of my praise you're robbing
[2:27:25] me
[2:27:26] you come in the house of the Lord and
[2:27:28] you don't open your mouth you don't lift
[2:27:30] your hands you don't exhibit you don't
[2:27:32] put forth any effort to help to draw the
[2:27:35] presence of the Lord and you're robbing
[2:27:38] me and in essence you're robbing
[2:27:40] yourself
[2:27:42] and when God reveals that to you we do
[2:27:46] not have to sit around for 10 years and
[2:27:49] feel guilt and condemnation we have the
[2:27:52] blessing of saying Lord I recognize it
[2:27:55] thank you for showing it to me I Repent
[2:27:57] I come back to you and now I just need
[2:28:00] to draw up real close to you and nurse
[2:28:02] strength from you I know it's the only
[2:28:04] way that I can get back to where I need
[2:28:07] to be
[2:28:08] El Shaddai
[2:28:11] musicians coming please
[2:28:16] verse 7 was an invitation that God gave
[2:28:19] to the people
[2:28:21] return unto me
[2:28:25] they gave back the words in what way
[2:28:29] have we
[2:28:31] robbed you or how rather rather how it
[2:28:35] shall we return to you God says return
[2:28:37] their response was how
[2:28:40] should we return to you
[2:28:44] and he said you've been a thief
[2:28:50] and now in verse 13 He says your words
[2:28:53] have been Stout against me
[2:28:56] Stout
[2:28:58] in this context is the same Hebrew word
[2:29:02] that is used when it says that Pharaoh
[2:29:05] hardened his heart against the Lord
[2:29:12] so the people give the response what if
[2:29:14] we spoken so much against you
[2:29:20] and God's response to them was
[2:29:24] you've said it's vain to serve the Lord
[2:29:27] you said what prophet is it that we've
[2:29:30] kept your ordinances
[2:29:32] and why have we walked mournfully before
[2:29:35] the Lord of hosts
[2:29:42] the words that they used
[2:29:45] against God God said
[2:29:49] it's just like Pharaoh hardening his
[2:29:51] heart
[2:29:53] you have said what prophet
[2:29:55] is it
[2:29:58] we give you modern day terms
[2:30:01] what's the use
[2:30:10] we would never admit that we said it to
[2:30:12] God
[2:30:15] but those words have come out of our
[2:30:17] mouth
[2:30:18] why should I even try
[2:30:21] what's the use
[2:30:23] I can't get it right
[2:30:29] and these kinds of words are stout
[2:30:33] against the Lord
[2:30:36] God recognizes that it's a hardening of
[2:30:40] our heart toward him
[2:30:42] and he wants to deal with it
[2:30:45] what prophet is it that we have kept
[2:30:48] your ordinances
[2:30:54] what has it profited us
[2:30:58] to live differently from all the rest of
[2:31:00] the church world
[2:31:08] what prophet is it that we've kept these
[2:31:10] ordinances
[2:31:13] these are words that have come out of
[2:31:15] our mouths
[2:31:19] and God in that time said
[2:31:24] this was
[2:31:25] because of hard-heartedness
[2:31:28] Stout
[2:31:30] words against him
[2:31:34] and the third thing was what profit is
[2:31:37] it that we have walked mournfully before
[2:31:38] the Lord of hosts now this word mournfly
[2:31:42] has an indication of what we might would
[2:31:45] call the black sheep of the family
[2:31:54] what profit is it that we are so
[2:31:56] different from everybody else
[2:31:58] none of the rest of the family likes us
[2:32:01] we dress differently we act differently
[2:32:03] we do things differently at church and
[2:32:05] who they they do they think it's all a
[2:32:08] bunch of nonsense that we run and shout
[2:32:10] and speak in tongues and
[2:32:13] lift our voices and live
[2:32:15] differently and we don't put on a little
[2:32:18] makeup here and
[2:32:21] act like Justin Bieber over there and
[2:32:26] on and on and on and on it goes
[2:32:32] and I just
[2:32:34] would encourage you to not let your
[2:32:36] words
[2:32:37] bestowed against the Lord
[2:32:41] the things that you say
[2:32:44] and remember when uh
[2:32:47] toward the start we talked about how
[2:32:50] that it was necessary to keep the
[2:32:52] Commandments of God before our eyes
[2:32:55] before our children to teach him to our
[2:32:58] children this was going to be
[2:33:00] multi-generational blessing that God
[2:33:02] wanted to pour out and it was necessary
[2:33:04] for the parents and the grandparents to
[2:33:07] keep this uh these Commandments before
[2:33:09] the children at all times keep them
[2:33:12] before our own eyes all the time the
[2:33:15] enemy wants us to deviate our eyesight
[2:33:17] in our minds he wants to deviate them to
[2:33:20] go a different direction while the Lord
[2:33:23] is wanting us to stay right on the
[2:33:24] straight path because he has a he has a
[2:33:28] plan for us he has a prefix Destiny for
[2:33:32] us he has a promise that he wants to
[2:33:35] pour out on your head and so he wants
[2:33:38] your cooperation in this in this whole
[2:33:41] thing he wants your cooperation and so
[2:33:44] he needs you to keep the command ever
[2:33:48] before you so that you don't start out
[2:33:51] offering him Stout words when you see
[2:33:54] other people that look like they live a
[2:33:56] whole lot looser than you do and it
[2:33:59] looks like that they have all kinds of a
[2:34:02] fancy how do you Do's in their life and
[2:34:04] it looks like that even though they
[2:34:06] don't pay tithe they have all kinds of
[2:34:09] blessing don't let your words become
[2:34:12] Stout against the Lord you remember that
[2:34:15] they have no intercession on their
[2:34:16] behalf
[2:34:21] all the good that it looks like that
[2:34:23] they have right now is one day going to
[2:34:25] come to a screeching halt
[2:34:28] but when you're walking under the
[2:34:29] blessing in the intercession of the Holy
[2:34:31] Spirit when you have everything in
[2:34:33] divine order and you're walking under
[2:34:35] the blessing of God because you're
[2:34:37] keeping Covenant with him and everybody
[2:34:39] is in their rightful place then the
[2:34:41] blessings can come into your life and it
[2:34:44] may not look like the blessing or the
[2:34:46] the the shiny stuff that all of the
[2:34:48] world has
[2:34:51] yet you can know that you're walking
[2:34:54] all of this may fade away
[2:34:57] whether you're rich or poor it's all
[2:34:59] going to fade away and one day you're
[2:35:01] going to step out of this body
[2:35:03] his body is going to drop
[2:35:06] and you are going to pick up a new one
[2:35:12] or else
[2:35:15] the rest of the Dead live not for a
[2:35:17] thousand years
[2:35:19] but then they come up before a judgment
[2:35:21] seat
[2:35:23] and I do not want to be found there I
[2:35:26] don't believe that is where I'll be
[2:35:27] found I believe that my judgment is
[2:35:29] happening right now on this Earth let's
[2:35:33] Stand Together
[2:35:40] there's more to cover here
[2:35:43] we'll see how that goes
[2:35:49] perhaps we'll finish it
[2:35:52] or perhaps it'll be like some of brother
[2:35:53] Shelley's sermons
[2:35:55] never got finished
[2:35:59] but I can't keep you here all day father
[2:36:02] how we thank you for your word
[2:36:06] we thank you Lord that you are working
[2:36:09] in us both to Will and to do of your
[2:36:11] good pleasure
[2:36:13] God I thank you that you have called us
[2:36:16] and you have placed your seal upon us
[2:36:19] you have placed your hand of protection
[2:36:21] upon us and God you have given us uh uh
[2:36:25] uh a place where that we are safe
[2:36:29] sheltered in the hand of God and it's
[2:36:31] because that you have allowed us to see
[2:36:34] the necessity for the proper
[2:36:36] intercession for everything to be in its
[2:36:39] divine order and we're thankful Lord for
[2:36:42] that order I thank you that we don't
[2:36:44] have to live our lives in chaos we don't
[2:36:47] have to live our lives in disorder we
[2:36:51] can live our lives under the blessing of
[2:36:54] the almighty God and know that you are
[2:36:56] pouring out blessings that this body
[2:37:00] this body cannot contain them
[2:37:04] Lord there's some of them no doubt that
[2:37:06] you withhold because we would explode
[2:37:09] because this physical body could not
[2:37:12] contain it
[2:37:14] yet you have prepared us a glorious body
[2:37:18] one to contain deity one to contain so
[2:37:24] much more than what we have right now
[2:37:27] and Lord we are looking forward to that
[2:37:29] but until that day we will rejoice with
[2:37:34] pleasure knowing that you have called us
[2:37:38] with a high and a holy calling you have
[2:37:42] invited us
