Description:
There is a crescendo that is taking place.
There is a consummation that is taking place.
And everything is gathering together in one moment.
We could even say that we're in a place like that as the little bride of Jesus Christ right now.
We're living in a world that's about to implode.
So the bride is at a very pivotal and important position in this hour.
And we're going to have to be very careful how we walk out the future days of our life.

because there's one thing you need to know if there's anything that you need to know and you don't know you will know because you're his if there's anything that has to be made real to you and it hasn't been made real to you yet hold on because if you're part of that elected bride there'll be no Rapture without you [Applause] because you become one with that word and the same holy ghost that helps you helps your neighbor there will help you if you keep your eyes on the Sun remember we preached last Sunday don't look at the church don't look at any church don't look at other message churches don't look at your church because there's flesh in all of them there's mistakes in all of them yes you get your eyes on people you won't feel you won't see that manifestation of the truth in you but you get your eyes on the son no matter what the storm is doing you hear the song doesn't matter what the storm is doing around you you get your eyes on Jesus get your eyes on Jesus someone said I can't figure all this out I don't know how to put all these things you're talking about terms that I don't know anything about well just stick around don't be scared off pick around because we have a determination to keep our eyes on Jesus and if we do he'll lead us all the way you see there's got to be a people who recognize when the pillar of fire moves that they don't just keep driving their state down but they keep following that Pillar of Fire because he'll not lead you off the word he leads you always back to the word we've got to have the Holy Ghost we've got to have the Holy Ghost I didn't say we've got to speak in tongues I said we've got to have the Holy Ghost because he changes everything amen he tuned you up so that you can hear the voice of God and keep moving forward there is a crescendo that is taking place there is a consummation that is taking place and everything is gathering together in one moment we could even say that we're in a place like that as the little bride of Jesus Christ right now we're living in a world that's about to implode so the bride is at a very pivotal and important position in this hour and we're going to have to be very careful how we walk out the Future Days of our life we're going to understand that what we have gotten by with in the past we may not get by with in this hour a compromise that we have picked up along the way that God has allowed us just to go on we may not be able to compromise the same way in this hour we may have to come back to what the prophet said he said you have gone as far with God as you're ever going to go until you're willing to pay a greater price and we might have to say Lord I want every bit of compromise out of my life I want everything out of my life that that is hindering me from the fullness of what your promise is to my life I think we may be in one of those transitioning moments
