[31:34] that i've never been forsaken
[31:37] and i've never had to stand one
[31:41] test alone
[31:43] that's when i look at all the victories
[31:47] and the spirit arises up in me
[31:51] and it's the rule of the fire my
[31:53] weakness is
[31:57] [Music]
[32:02] and he never promised that the cross
[32:06] would not get heavy
[32:08] and the hill would not be hard to
[32:14] [Music]
[32:16] and he never offered
[32:18] one victory without fighting but he said
[32:22] help would always come in time
[32:28] oh just remember when you're standing
[32:32] in that valley of decision
[32:35] and the
[32:36] adversary says given

[32:48] and he will take you through the fire
[32:52] again

[33:00] surely perish oh but if i trust the
[33:04] mighty hand of god he'll shield those
[33:07] flames again
[33:17] [Music]
[33:23] be hard to
[33:25] glide

[33:53] just hold on
[33:57] cause my god he'll show up
[34:00] and he will take you through the fire
[34:04] again
[34:09] cause he never promised that the cross
[34:12] would not get heavy
[34:15] for that hill would not be hard to
[34:22] and he never offered even one victory
[34:26] without fighting but he said help would
[34:30] always come in time

[34:51] just my lord he'll show up
[34:54] and he will take you through the fire

[35:06] would not get heavy
[35:09] and the who would not be hard to
[35:13] climb
[35:16] he never promised
[35:20] victory without fighting he said help
[35:23] will always come
[35:26] in time
[35:30] when you're standing
[35:33] in the body of decision
[35:36] and the
[35:37] adversary says giving

[46:24] [Music]
[46:34] is
[46:36] [Music]
[46:51] [Music]
[47:04] so
[47:05] [Music]
[47:11] there has never been a people
[47:13] in the history of the world
[47:16] more prepared to fight this great fight
[47:19] against darkness than the little bride
[47:22] of jesus christ and the same god who
[47:25] offered the scroll to john has offered
[47:29] you and i the scroll and if we'll take
[47:32] it and eat it by faith it will transform
[47:36] us from the inside out if you believe
[47:39] that same man
[47:40] let's give god praise tonight
[47:43] oh
[47:44] hallelujah
[47:46] [Music]
[47:49] hallelujah
[47:57] you may be seated tonight no apologies
[48:02] i just can't bring myself to apologize
[48:05] for that kind of carrying on
[48:08] we are equipped
[48:10] i'm so thankful tonight can you imagine
[48:12] living
[48:13] in this evil age
[48:16] with no equipment
[48:18] can you imagine facing it totally alone
[48:21] but because god has offered you the open
[48:25] book
[48:26] because god has offered us the open
[48:29] scroll
[48:30] brother branham said that john is a type
[48:33] of the bride
[48:34] so what you see god saying to john he's
[48:37] saying to us
[48:39] he said you take that scroll and you eat
[48:42] it and it'll be bitter
[48:45] sweet in your mouth
[48:47] and what in your belly
[48:49] bitter in your belly
[48:51] why wouldn't it be sweet in your mouth
[48:52] and sweet in your belly if it was sweet
[48:54] in your belly you might just keep eating
[48:57] it and eating it and never doing
[48:59] anything with it
[49:00] but it gets sour once it hits the body
[49:03] once it gets down in there and starts
[49:05] going against your denominational
[49:07] mindset
[49:10] once it starts talking about granny's
[49:12] religion and telling you granny didn't
[49:14] have the godhead right
[49:17] and uncle uncle george wasn't baptized
[49:19] in the name of jesus
[49:21] and you got to get that and you say well
[49:23] it was good enough for them it's good
[49:25] enough for me gets a little bitter down
[49:27] there but i want you to know god is
[49:29] transforming his people from the inside
[49:31] out
[49:32] and it starts working its way somebody
[49:34] said that's so gross they say that's so
[49:37] gross to talk about i didn't write the
[49:38] book
[49:40] all i know is what jesus said jesus said
[49:42] i would that thou art hot or cold the
[49:45] lukewarm i will vomit
[49:47] the word spit is vomit out of my mouth
[49:51] and so that same principle
[49:54] uh is is applied in this moment when
[49:57] that when that word gets down there and
[50:00] starts stirring and a little sour in the
[50:01] belly it starts making its way back up
[50:04] and he said what did he say prophesy
[50:07] again
[50:08] you must release that word god didn't
[50:12] give you this feast to keep it to
[50:14] yourself
[50:16] he gave it to us to release to somebody
[50:19] else
[50:20] i'm not even looking at your faces i'm
[50:22] trying to kind of just
[50:23] glance around
[50:25] because i've been i really don't have to
[50:27] have a lot of acknowledgement tonight
[50:29] when i know i'm telling you the truth
[50:32] and i'm not going to preach
[50:34] brother brooks is going to preach but
[50:36] that kind of song will make you want to
[50:37] preach
[50:39] oh you're one of those that doesn't
[50:41] fight like somebody's shadowboxing
[50:43] you're not just beating the air when the
[50:46] bride of jesus christ starts taking her
[50:48] authority and she starts speaking that
[50:51] word it hits the mark every time
[50:54] there's no principality there's no power
[50:57] there's no spiritual wickedness in high
[50:59] places that can stand before the
[51:02] authority of jesus christ in his elected
[51:05] lady in this hour if you believe that
[51:08] i'll give you a chance to say amen
[51:10] [Music]
[51:11] you are so welcome here tonight i guess
[51:13] i should look at you now we are so glad
[51:16] that you are here tonight and you all
[51:18] didn't know i had so much family in
[51:20] indiana did you i have so many cousins

[51:25] i mean in indiana even though i'm way
[51:27] down here in alabama and i don't want to
[51:30] embarrass them brother greeley has
[51:31] already made mention of them but i won't
[51:33] ever want him to stand because one big
[51:35] van load come in today and i haven't had
[51:38] a chance to greet them so all my alabama
[51:40] i mean my indiana cousins stand up would
[51:43] you right now
[51:45] isn't this wonderful
[51:47] thank you all so much thank you so much
[51:50] for coming
[51:52] i appreciate it god bless you all
[51:55] god bless you we are so thankful we've
[51:58] enjoyed the fellowship that the lord has
[52:01] given us and i said to him last night
[52:03] you don't ever know where these folk are
[52:05] going to pop up because i saw them way
[52:08] out in in arizona the first time and
[52:10] then i've seen them in ohio and now some
[52:13] of them have been this way about three
[52:15] times to alabama and we're so glad to
[52:17] have you all here
[52:19] brother uh brooks brother wilson
[52:22] hembree's son is back there you won't
[52:24] miss him
[52:26] he's a big boy
[52:28] and uh i remember coming to brother
[52:30] hembridge church one time
[52:32] to hear you preach
[52:34] and i'm telling you
[52:36] do you remember brian do you remember
[52:37] you remember what meeting we had
[52:40] i believe we can have a meeting tonight
[52:42] like that
[52:43] praise god brother curry again your
[52:46] people wonderful thank you all for being
[52:48] here we want to receive an offering
[52:51] tonight
[52:52] we want to make sure that there are no
[52:53] expenses left unmet for the for the camp
[52:57] and when as brother greeley said last
[52:59] night when brother uh
[53:01] brooks leaves here we want him to leave
[53:04] very very very blessed we want him to
[53:08] know that we believe
[53:10] in alabama that a laborer is worthy of
[53:13] his hire
[53:15] and when we give to the work of god and
[53:17] the servant of god we're giving for the
[53:19] kingdom of god and i have known brother
[53:22] and sister brooks for a long long time
[53:24] since their children were little
[53:26] and i have known the life that they have
[53:28] lived and the character that they have
[53:30] lived life with you know that really
[53:32] means something
[53:34] those scandals
[53:35] have brought them down because they've
[53:37] lived as close to jesus as they possibly
[53:40] could how many of you appreciate
[53:41] somebody with a testimony like that
[53:44] i don't have to coerce you i don't have
[53:46] to beg you or plead with you because
[53:48] most of us in this room and i i'm sure
[53:51] so most of the visitors too
[53:53] have learned through the years that you
[53:55] just don't out give god
[53:57] and you give some time until you think
[53:59] there's nothing left to give and what
[54:02] does he do but he opens up a blessing
[54:04] and it comes and we have people around
[54:06] here that when god does that for them
[54:09] they don't just say well i gave and god
[54:12] gave that to me
[54:14] they say i gave and god gave that to me
[54:16] now let me take part of this and give
[54:18] back to him well what does that do but
[54:20] create a beautiful cycle of sowing and
[54:23] reaping am i offending you by talking to
[54:26] something that's mentioned a lot in the
[54:28] scripture i don't think so
[54:30] you know people don't realize sometime
[54:32] until you start marking them down or
[54:34] listing them but you start
[54:37] looking at all those scriptures where
[54:39] god talks about of course it's a giving
[54:40] of ourselves our talents our gifts and
[54:44] you start seeing that god has fixed that
[54:46] law and it always works it if you sow a
[54:49] good seed you're always going to reap a
[54:51] good harvest well anyway that's just the
[54:53] promise of the lord father we thank you
[54:56] tonight for your servant that you have
[54:58] sent our way
[55:00] we have already been blessed last night
[55:02] by the word and he was apologizing for
[55:05] taking so much time but lord it was like
[55:08] a full meal to us and we were clinging
[55:13] on every word and i pray tonight that
[55:16] you will anoint him and use him to
[55:19] minister now lord we bring our offering
[55:22] to you tonight we lay it at your feet
[55:24] would you use it and multiply it and
[55:27] lord would you bless the ministry of
[55:30] brother brooks and his precious wife the
[55:32] churches that he sees after and those
[55:34] saints that you have placed in his care
[55:37] and lord we pray for his children and
[55:41] spouses and the entire brooks family
[55:45] lord that they can experience a a
[55:48] renewing and a refreshing and a reviving
[55:51] oh god and protect them and keep them in
[55:54] this evil hour
[55:56] we ask you to bless the giver
[55:58] and let it be poured out as you have
[56:00] promised press down shaken together and
[56:04] running over and we will give you the
[56:06] glory and the honor and the praise for
[56:08] it's in the lovely name of the lord

[1:03:36] was all said and done hundreds of people
[1:03:39] have viewed the service last night and
[1:03:41] already sending notes to say was so

[1:04:27] a story he might tell or we might
[1:04:29] reminisce
[1:04:31] it means something to me in the natural
[1:04:33] but it's that gift that you've given him
[1:04:36] to get out of the way
[1:04:38] and let you speak through him

[1:24:22] and the devil don't want us to know that
[1:24:25] you know we we've got it in our heads

[1:24:30] amen because that's where the joy bells
[1:24:32] rings
[1:24:34] amen the ninth verse
[1:24:36] it says who have saved us
[1:24:40] and called us
[1:24:42] with the holy calling
[1:24:44] not according to our works
[1:24:47] but according to his own purpose
[1:24:50] and grace and i just love the way he
[1:24:52] makes his grace in there with that
[1:24:54] purpose
[1:24:55] amen
[1:24:57] which was given
[1:24:59] us in christ jesus
[1:25:02] before
[1:25:03] the world
[1:25:04] began
[1:25:06] now how are you going to lose
[1:25:09] when it was given to you before you got
[1:25:12] here
[1:25:16] hallelujah
[1:25:17] and one thing i love about god
[1:25:20] he will never take it back
[1:25:22] he cannot take it back
[1:25:25] let us pray
[1:25:26] heavenly father we come before you
[1:25:29] and we thank you for your amazing grace
[1:25:32] we thank you for being so good to us

[1:25:40] and lord jesus we thank you tonight
[1:25:43] because we come to hear from you lord
[1:25:45] thou god we're just a vessel or just a
[1:25:48] piece of clay lord i pray that there be
[1:25:50] nothing in me oh god that would hinder
[1:25:52] your utterance in the end of your move
[1:25:54] lord let your holy spirit speak through
[1:25:57] us lord and speak to your people lord

[1:26:02] time where we should be revived
[1:26:05] hallelujah on fire for you lord and so
[1:26:08] we're calling upon your name because we
[1:26:10] know who you're the only one that can
[1:26:13] set our souls of fire hallelujah and
[1:26:16] we'll cry out tonight oh lord wants more
[1:26:20] do it again once more and father we give
[1:26:25] you the praise glory and honor
[1:26:28] in your lovely name jesus christ we pray
[1:26:30] amen
[1:26:32] you may be seated before i get into my
[1:26:34] message i just want to thank god
[1:26:38] for the many things that
[1:26:40] you know he's shown us
[1:26:42] and uh
[1:26:43] the thing that i love about god and the
[1:26:45] word that's open uh you know it's
[1:26:48] remember i ministered a little bit on
[1:26:50] last night i let the mind of god be in
[1:26:52] you it's so important that you and i
[1:26:55] make connection
[1:26:57] hallelujah because
[1:26:58] you can't be led by the spirit without
[1:27:01] being connected
[1:27:03] you understand me god will tell you
[1:27:05] things amen that's not written
[1:27:09] once you are connected it's in the book
[1:27:13] but it's unwritten word
[1:27:15] for an example
[1:27:17] when that woman with the issue of blood
[1:27:20] she needed help from god
[1:27:23] right
[1:27:23] and there was nothing
[1:27:26] in the scrolls
[1:27:27] that said to her if you touch his
[1:27:30] garment
[1:27:31] you'll be made whole
[1:27:33] but her mind connected with god's mind
[1:27:37] right you understand what i'm saying it
[1:27:39] bypass jesus
[1:27:43] is that right the man jesus
[1:27:45] it went straight to the throne of god
[1:27:48] it touched him
[1:27:51] and then because she touched him
[1:27:54] amen the word of god came down
[1:27:58] and she went in that inspiration
[1:28:01] and she touched him of his comet and
[1:28:04] then jesus said who touched me
[1:28:08] y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:28:10] you must understand that this is the age
[1:28:12] of the mind hallelujah this is the age
[1:28:16] where intellect is flourishing in the
[1:28:19] world
[1:28:20] [Music]
[1:28:21] even to a point they think they're
[1:28:23] smarter than god but what it is is that
[1:28:26] they're they're trying to figure things
[1:28:28] out by way of science
[1:28:31] hallelujah but we are understanding by
[1:28:34] way of revelation
[1:28:36] somebody help me here
[1:28:38] because i want you to understand that
[1:28:40] when you come to a place when you
[1:28:42] connect with god you'll never have to
[1:28:45] worry about whether god can hear you or
[1:28:47] not
[1:28:49] hallelujah science will fail you
[1:28:54] and we're living in a time where science
[1:28:56] is rapid
[1:28:58] uh some of the thoughts that i wanted to
[1:29:00] say last night
[1:29:02] i'm not sure if i said them but it was
[1:29:04] like in a time even when science was in
[1:29:07] the days of noah that god had to build
[1:29:10] an ark
[1:29:11] and that ark was to save noah from the
[1:29:14] men of science
[1:29:17] hallelujah
[1:29:19] and even in this last day because of the
[1:29:22] science we're living in the same kind of
[1:29:25] condition no one lived in but on a
[1:29:29] higher scale
[1:29:31] y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:29:33] and god has already declared that he has
[1:29:36] never left himself without a witness
[1:29:39] there's somebody who knows the lord
[1:29:42] there's somebody here tonight that's not
[1:29:45] ashamed of the lord there's somebody who
[1:29:49] is a witness for the lord hallelujah no
[1:29:53] matter what the world is saying about us
[1:29:56] hallelujah and so what i'm trying to say
[1:29:59] is we may look crazy
[1:30:01] we look like oddballs
[1:30:05] hallelujah it's only because we are
[1:30:07] connected
[1:30:10] and and what the devil is afraid of
[1:30:13] is for you to understand
[1:30:15] that you've never truly been
[1:30:16] disconnected
[1:30:19] the blood of jesus christ
[1:30:22] shared at calvary
[1:30:24] was shared to show you and to give you
[1:30:26] revelation
[1:30:28] that you who were sons and daughters
[1:30:31] have always been sons and daughters
[1:30:34] hallelujah without that blood being shed
[1:30:38] we were lost in darkness
[1:30:41] but because of the blood of jesus christ
[1:30:43] we are now coming to know who we really
[1:30:46] are
[1:30:48] hallelujah
[1:30:50] now i'm looking for a revival
[1:30:54] and i'm not talking about just dancing
[1:30:57] and shouting i'm talking about really
[1:30:59] getting the trash out of my life
[1:31:01] hallelujah amen you say well what do you
[1:31:04] mean i love all of that you all know
[1:31:06] that y'all know me i tell people don't
[1:31:08] don't don't invite me if you don't want
[1:31:09] me to dance hallelujah because i can't
[1:31:12] guarantee you nothing
[1:31:14] hallelujah so when it comes to this uh
[1:31:17] revival we're talking about uh y'all
[1:31:20] know the story there was a little story
[1:31:22] there in the bible
[1:31:23] and it was during the time of solomon
[1:31:25] and and these two women were basically
[1:31:28] ill
[1:31:29] famed women and and they both had babies
[1:31:33] around the same time it was a time like
[1:31:36] this
[1:31:37] time was getting hard amen the stock
[1:31:39] market had crashed
[1:31:42] and there was no food available
[1:31:44] so what israel began to do was that they
[1:31:47] began to eat their children and
[1:31:50] hello
[1:31:52] don't you understand what i'm saying
[1:31:54] you better know that you're living in
[1:31:56] america
[1:31:58] and the people here have no morals
[1:32:00] they have no standards
[1:32:02] hallelujah and when the stock market
[1:32:05] crash and when all of these things
[1:32:07] happen and there is no food
[1:32:10] hallelujah you better watch out for
[1:32:13] yourself
[1:32:15] now some of y'all looking at me like i'm
[1:32:17] crazy
[1:32:18] but cannibalism amen has not just
[1:32:20] started
[1:32:21] it's always existed
[1:32:24] even in the time when when when when uh
[1:32:26] uh uh 70 a.d amen when
[1:32:30] when the when god had already told amen
[1:32:33] his uh people to flee the city
[1:32:36] right
[1:32:37] and we find out and i can't think of his
[1:32:39] name the devil took me
[1:32:41] but anyway he marched on israel
[1:32:44] and he literally shut them in within the
[1:32:47] walls
[1:32:48] and they began to eat the bark off the
[1:32:51] trees
[1:32:52] they began to eat their children
[1:32:56] hallelujah
[1:32:58] and god had already talked to them and
[1:33:01] prophesied when you see the armies
[1:33:04] encamped about jerusalem
[1:33:07] you need to flee
[1:33:09] leave all of your stuff
[1:33:12] hallelujah and every believer that heard
[1:33:16] that sermon
[1:33:18] escaped
[1:33:20] y'all hear what i'm saying that's why
[1:33:22] it's so important to come to church
[1:33:26] every day the church door is open
[1:33:30] because the bible said when you see that
[1:33:33] day approaching
[1:33:35] come together the lord
[1:33:37] hallelujah you'll never know what god is
[1:33:40] going to say over this pulpit on the
[1:33:42] inspiration that will keep you
[1:33:46] hallelujah you say brother brooks god
[1:33:48] don't do that anymore yes he does
[1:33:51] when we first came out of the system in
[1:33:53] colombia we had almost every gift there
[1:33:56] was
[1:33:57] prophecy we had uh discernment we had it
[1:34:00] all
[1:34:01] and every time the police was going to
[1:34:04] uh attack the area that we're getting we
[1:34:07] were going to worship in we had a
[1:34:08] prophecy
[1:34:10] don't show up there
[1:34:12] go over here
[1:34:14] hallelujah
[1:34:15] and it never never did fail
[1:34:19] the police would come to the house that
[1:34:21] we previously would worship again and
[1:34:23] would find nobody
[1:34:25] hallelujah why because god
[1:34:28] always was a step head ahead of the
[1:34:31] policeman
[1:34:33] he's the same god today
[1:34:36] hallelujah
[1:34:38] but what happened
[1:34:40] we find out that one of these women
[1:34:42] baby they died during the night
[1:34:46] hallelujah
[1:34:47] and both of them came before
[1:34:49] and she stole the other lady's baby
[1:34:52] hallelujah and she came before
[1:34:55] solomon
[1:34:57] they both did
[1:34:59] and they both were claiming amen to to
[1:35:02] to to to to to say that they were the
[1:35:04] mothers
[1:35:06] hallelujah is that right but solomon
[1:35:09] having the wisdom
[1:35:11] he told his servant go get me the sword
[1:35:16] y'all understand me
[1:35:18] go get my sword what sword was it it was
[1:35:20] the king's sword
[1:35:23] hallelujah and that king's sword was
[1:35:26] able to divide
[1:35:28] it was able to to sort out who was the
[1:35:31] real mother
[1:35:32] [Music]
[1:35:33] hallelujah
[1:35:35] and understand those those babies was
[1:35:37] like a type of revival
[1:35:40] and we find out that the woman who says
[1:35:42] hey man whatever you want to do cut him
[1:35:44] in half you could give her pardon and
[1:35:47] you can give me part but you see the
[1:35:49] bride is not like that
[1:35:51] she don't want a halfway revival
[1:35:55] hallelujah
[1:35:56] and what did that other woman says no
[1:35:59] whatever you do
[1:36:01] i've got to have a whole revival
[1:36:04] hallelujah give the baby to her
[1:36:08] and solomon said no
[1:36:10] this woman
[1:36:12] she's the real mother
[1:36:15] y'all hear what i'm saying so we're not
[1:36:17] here in this age for a halfway revival
[1:36:22] oh glory to god we're here to have a
[1:36:25] full revival so much so that we'll bring
[1:36:29] him out of heaven
[1:36:32] hallelujah
[1:36:34] that's all right
[1:36:36] you say well brother brooks
[1:36:38] i want to tell you something
[1:36:40] you and i must understand that god
[1:36:42] speaks
[1:36:43] and then a lot of times people he'll
[1:36:45] tell you something
[1:36:47] and he won't tell others
[1:36:50] and you think well you know i'm going to
[1:36:52] tell them share with them what god has
[1:36:54] shared with me
[1:36:55] and you say well look what god did for
[1:36:57] me and they said oh okay okay
[1:37:02] they don't get it
[1:37:04] it wasn't for them
[1:37:07] hallelujah and what we need to do we
[1:37:10] need to learn and then how okay somebody
[1:37:14] says well let me tell you something
[1:37:16] brother adam said it like this he said
[1:37:18] when those seven seals opened he said
[1:37:21] all those shadows and types
[1:37:23] were symbolic
[1:37:24] of christ
[1:37:26] it literally gave us a story that we
[1:37:29] didn't understand
[1:37:30] and if we take those those those those
[1:37:33] those
[1:37:34] what we call stories
[1:37:36] and let the holy spirit minister to us
[1:37:39] we'll begin to see what that was all
[1:37:41] about because it was literally speaking
[1:37:44] in code for you
[1:37:47] hallelujah god telling you a story that
[1:37:50] the devil has read all of these years
[1:37:53] and never did understand it
[1:37:56] but by revelation
[1:37:58] he's giving to you what you need to
[1:38:00] understand about your path
[1:38:04] hallelujah and your purpose
[1:38:07] hallelujah is that right oh you say well
[1:38:09] what about bastard let me just go there
[1:38:12] because we remember
[1:38:14] vasta how many y'all remember
[1:38:16] some people call it vasti
[1:38:18] but vasti was uh first the queen's wife
[1:38:22] key's wife right
[1:38:23] and she represented the pentecostal
[1:38:25] church
[1:38:26] she was rich and increased with goods
[1:38:29] hallelujah
[1:38:31] and she right now she didn't want the
[1:38:33] king anymore
[1:38:34] why because her churches got so big
[1:38:37] she was the favorite of the king y'all
[1:38:40] know that's the truth
[1:38:41] because the prophet god even told us
[1:38:43] that the pentecostal church outgrew the
[1:38:46] catholic church
[1:38:48] hallelujah so she was the favorite
[1:38:51] but when the king called
[1:38:53] hallelujah when god sent a voice
[1:38:56] she didn't want to hear the voice
[1:38:58] she wouldn't come to the voice she
[1:39:01] literally put the voice out
[1:39:04] hallelujah you hear what i'm saying
[1:39:06] thank god for vastly thank god for what
[1:39:10] she did
[1:39:11] because of because of what she did it
[1:39:14] made room for us
[1:39:16] somebody help me here
[1:39:18] you see i want you to understand you're
[1:39:20] in the word
[1:39:22] and these shadows and types are telling
[1:39:24] you exactly what god is going to do for
[1:39:26] you
[1:39:28] hallelujah and here was a no-name church
[1:39:32] not a big famous one
[1:39:33] odessa
[1:39:35] hallelujah
[1:39:36] and mordecai gave her a new name
[1:39:39] y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:39:40] hallelujah i call you no longer church
[1:39:42] but bride
[1:39:43] you hear what i'm saying
[1:39:45] and so what happened she stayed
[1:39:48] in that place
[1:39:50] where she was hardly ever recognized
[1:39:53] though she was queen
[1:39:55] you hear what i'm saying
[1:39:57] and that's the way the bride is
[1:39:59] but you wait
[1:40:01] it's coming
[1:40:02] the pressure is building
[1:40:05] things are changing
[1:40:06] hallelujah and those of you who are
[1:40:09] ashamed you won't make it but for those
[1:40:12] who know
[1:40:13] where to go
[1:40:15] hallelujah you know that god loves you
[1:40:18] you know that you have been pan-picked
[1:40:21] by god you know that you have come in a
[1:40:24] time such as this hallelujah you see
[1:40:28] your purpose and your purpose amen is to
[1:40:31] turn the hands of time
[1:40:34] and you say what do you mean where the
[1:40:36] alpha becomes the omega
[1:40:39] hallelujah it'll be the bride amen total
[1:40:43] bride amen in the form of jesus christ
[1:40:50] god
[1:40:51] what happens
[1:40:54] you heard us i'm not going to go all the
[1:40:55] way with that
[1:40:56] but nevertheless
[1:40:58] when it came to esther
[1:41:00] she knew where to go
[1:41:02] and this is where our attitude and this
[1:41:04] must be your attitude if i perish
[1:41:07] let me perish
[1:41:09] i'm going to see the king
[1:41:11] got to see him brother
[1:41:13] if i perish
[1:41:14] let me perish if my mother don't go if
[1:41:18] my father don't go if my sister don't go
[1:41:21] if my brother don't go if my deacon a
[1:41:24] preacher don't go i'm going
[1:41:28] hallelujah if it's going to cause my
[1:41:31] death i'm going
[1:41:33] hallelujah you hear what i'm saying
[1:41:35] and by that attitude with that attitude
[1:41:38] she became victorious
[1:41:41] hallelujah god didn't build a bride to
[1:41:44] be a coward
[1:41:45] i'ma say that again
[1:41:47] and we've got no reason for cowing down
[1:41:50] to the devil's wine
[1:41:52] hallelujah god has made us omnipotent
[1:41:57] is that right all powerful
[1:42:00] and and we know amen how the man of god
[1:42:03] says when two omnipotents come together
[1:42:05] when they meet something's got to happen
[1:42:10] now you know what that means we're
[1:42:12] talking about holy ghost field people
[1:42:14] we're not just talking about sanctified
[1:42:16] we're talking about two holy ghosts feel
[1:42:18] people when they get together and they
[1:42:21] connect and agree
[1:42:22] something has to happen
[1:42:25] hallelujah
[1:42:26] you hear what i'm saying
[1:42:28] by god's grace let me give you one more
[1:42:30] example remember eliza because i want
[1:42:33] you to understand that we're now in
[1:42:36] with the headship we're we're connecting
[1:42:38] with the head the virtues of christ is
[1:42:40] moving up within us and so therefore
[1:42:42] before we make a rapture jesus christ
[1:42:45] must be the complete headship of the
[1:42:46] bride of jesus christ i'm not talking by
[1:42:49] word i'm talking about by manifestation
[1:42:54] hallelujah you understand me
[1:42:57] so what happens
[1:42:58] eliza says lord
[1:43:00] when i go see rebecca when i go when i
[1:43:02] go get this woman amen for isaac
[1:43:05] says lord let it be i'll put a decree
[1:43:07] before you
[1:43:08] let it be
[1:43:10] that when i go to this place and this
[1:43:13] woman comes out lord may she give my men
[1:43:16] water to drink
[1:43:18] and my camels
[1:43:20] is that right and the prophet god said
[1:43:23] god the angel of the lord went to
[1:43:27] uh rebecca he said about a half hour
[1:43:31] before
[1:43:32] eliezer got there because god works on
[1:43:35] both ends
[1:43:37] y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:43:39] god works on both ears and that's what
[1:43:41] we must understand you are never alone
[1:43:45] amen so he works on both ends
[1:43:48] hallelujah
[1:43:49] and
[1:43:50] god rebecca sees eliza
[1:43:54] and she comes out
[1:43:56] and all eliza's asked for
[1:43:59] he said give me a drink
[1:44:02] that's all he asked for
[1:44:04] he never said the other part
[1:44:08] he never but he said it to to abraham
[1:44:11] this is what i want her to do water the
[1:44:12] camels too
[1:44:14] see but somehow through that connection
[1:44:17] with god
[1:44:18] she knew the unspoken word
[1:44:21] was given to her by the angel
[1:44:26] oh lord help us jesus so you say what do
[1:44:29] you mean this is why this is a time of
[1:44:31] consecration
[1:44:33] this is a time of dedication
[1:44:35] this is a time when your eyes must be
[1:44:37] focused on jesus
[1:44:39] y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:44:41] it must be that way in order for you to
[1:44:44] catch him
[1:44:46] what do you mean we're working with
[1:44:49] dimensions
[1:44:50] hallelujah
[1:44:52] there's a radio in here that can pick up
[1:44:54] waves that you and i can't do
[1:44:56] but it's built to pick up waves
[1:44:58] hallelujah and the bride is built to
[1:45:01] pick up waves
[1:45:03] she's built to pick up the word or the
[1:45:05] mind of god is that right that's why the
[1:45:08] bible said let this mind be in you
[1:45:11] you've got to surrender to it you must
[1:45:14] let it be in you
[1:45:16] because when you surrender to it you
[1:45:18] will catch his thought you'll know
[1:45:20] exactly what he wants you to do
[1:45:23] sometimes he tries to connect with us
[1:45:26] even when we sleep he said get up and
[1:45:28] pray
[1:45:30] and you say lord give me 10 more minutes
[1:45:34] you just missed your connection
[1:45:37] y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:45:39] you're saying why don't you go over to
[1:45:41] susie's house and i hope nobody's named
[1:45:43] susie but go over to susie house and and
[1:45:46] visit her and encourage her
[1:45:50] y'all don't hear him talk like that
[1:45:52] oh i do
[1:45:53] he'll say call up a brother he needs
[1:45:56] encouragement
[1:45:58] y'all hear what i'm saying it's when
[1:46:00] you're connected
[1:46:03] and i hate to meet god miss god's
[1:46:05] connection
[1:46:06] i hate it
[1:46:08] because he'll tell you to do something
[1:46:10] and then the devil put a distraction in
[1:46:12] your way and
[1:46:14] and you'll follow that distraction and
[1:46:16] instead of what god just told you to do
[1:46:20] oh i hate that but nevertheless we do
[1:46:23] because he's teaching us we're learning
[1:46:26] amen to hear his thoughts
[1:46:29] oh come on somebody that's what rebecca
[1:46:32] did she heard his thoughts
[1:46:35] and because she heard his thoughts amen
[1:46:38] she not only gave ellie either water but
[1:46:41] she watered the camels too
[1:46:43] and ellie isn't this you're the one
[1:46:47] you're the one
[1:46:48] you are the one
[1:46:50] he didn't look for nobody else
[1:46:52] he started pulling out the gifts man
[1:46:57] you hear what i'm saying
[1:46:58] and people say we don't need no gifts we
[1:47:00] need everything
[1:47:03] hallelujah so when he comes he'll know
[1:47:06] that his gifts that were given to us
[1:47:08] were precious in our sight
[1:47:12] oh god help us jesus
[1:47:15] we are so far off and i tell people i
[1:47:17] said you know what i get so tired of
[1:47:19] systematic worship
[1:47:21] hallelujah you go to church you know
[1:47:23] what they're going to sing you know what
[1:47:25] the preacher going to preach you know
[1:47:27] how long he's going to preach you're
[1:47:29] going to go you're going to sing a
[1:47:30] little bit more and that's it
[1:47:33] that's too systematic
[1:47:35] there was a time when those old saints
[1:47:37] of god didn't know what time they were
[1:47:39] going to get out
[1:47:40] hallelujah the power of god faith i tell
[1:47:43] you what i believe that's the perfect
[1:47:45] will anyway
[1:47:48] because one of these old days we're
[1:47:49] going to reminisce and we're going to
[1:47:51] wish we had
[1:47:53] hallelujah just like some of us when the
[1:47:55] holy spirit hit us and and you'll hear
[1:47:57] something say raise your hand and you'll
[1:47:59] look around god you just grieved him
[1:48:02] you just grieved him
[1:48:04] how many times amen you sat in your seat
[1:48:07] and the holy ghost is moving people and
[1:48:09] all of a sudden you see an image looking
[1:48:11] just like yourself running down the
[1:48:13] aisle
[1:48:14] you know what you're supposed to do
[1:48:16] catch up with him
[1:48:21] you get a vision of your theophany and
[1:48:23] you won't even move
[1:48:25] what is it you have come into that
[1:48:27] channel you come into that dimension
[1:48:29] where your spiritual man can see the
[1:48:30] things that's happening in the spiritual
[1:48:32] world and you sat right there
[1:48:35] you'll never get victory like that
[1:48:38] hallelujah god always asked y'all
[1:48:41] uh uh the things uh for you and i to do
[1:48:44] that makes no sense
[1:48:46] if you think that he's going to ask you
[1:48:48] something that's going to make sense
[1:48:49] that's not god
[1:48:53] he never does
[1:48:55] is that right he totally lies at this
[1:48:57] throw that piece of wood in the water
[1:49:00] and the axe head is going to float
[1:49:04] huh what science book he was reading
[1:49:09] dang come on somebody that's not even
[1:49:12] that's that makes no sense in physics
[1:49:15] y'all hear what i'm saying but he did he
[1:49:18] he wasn't about he it had no science
[1:49:20] book he heard that he heard the voice of
[1:49:22] the god who was who made the science
[1:49:28] hallelujah
[1:49:29] it doesn't make sense
[1:49:31] touching the hem of his garment
[1:49:33] it doesn't make sense
[1:49:35] dipping seven times in the water
[1:49:38] to cleanse leopard set
[1:49:40] they don't even have a cure for leprosy
[1:49:42] today
[1:49:43] we got the cure
[1:49:46] hallelujah because jesus christ is the
[1:49:48] same yesterday today and forever he's a
[1:49:52] god that changes not
[1:49:56] right hallelujah
[1:49:58] and when it comes see i'm trying to tell
[1:49:59] you a lot of times we want to we it's
[1:50:02] good to read this we supposed to read

[1:51:00] now i said all of those things to get to
[1:51:02] my lesson
[1:51:04] because i want you to understand that
[1:51:06] when the book when god began to open
[1:51:08] this message and open this book up to us
[1:51:10] it became a new book
[1:51:12] it became more than just a a book of
[1:51:15] history
[1:51:16] it became a book of life
[1:51:19] hallelujah and understand this by the
[1:51:21] grace of god your predestination as as a
[1:51:25] lot of people don't understand is is
[1:51:27] according to your choice
[1:51:29] hello
[1:51:31] he predestinated you because you chose

[1:56:55] with this is that when you crave sin
[1:56:58] you better understand the craving is
[1:57:01] going to be better than the reality and
[1:57:04] he's not going to tell you
[1:57:06] what you in for until you've done
[1:57:09] something you shouldn't be doing.
[1:57:16] he's a deceiver
[1:57:18] he did it to eve didn't he
[1:57:21] he did not tell eve what was coming her
[1:57:23] way

[1:57:31] that she could no longer fix
[1:57:35] oh come on somebody you and i right now
[1:57:38] have we we're redeemed but we've got
[1:57:41] scars in our lives because of things we

[1:57:49] and we had no idea
[1:57:53] we had no idea
[1:57:55] the affliction
[1:57:57] that was going to be on our flesh
[1:57:59] as well as our spirit
[1:58:01] oh don't even talk about the mind
[1:58:04] because even though you're saved that
[1:58:06] devil will still bring back those
[1:58:09] wicked things that you once did
[1:58:12] hallelujah and you got to shut him down
[1:58:16] and let him know this mind belongs to
[1:58:19] god
[1:58:20] hallelujah
[1:58:22] that's the way i used to be and when he
[1:58:24] comes to me i said oh devil i got you
[1:58:26] those are not my thoughts that's yours
[1:58:29] you're not gonna give me that i don't
[1:58:31] want it those are your thoughts and not
[1:58:34] mine
[1:58:34] and when you talk to him like that he's
[1:58:36] got to go
[1:58:40] hallelujah
[1:58:41] yes lord called us
[1:58:44] uh you know i think about it i says lord
[1:58:46] i don't know how many people are going
[1:58:47] to make us rapture
[1:58:49] but i'm one of them
[1:58:53] amen
[1:58:54] since i enjoyed that song i'm going to
[1:58:56] call her sister breakthrough
[1:59:00] but you know i want you to understand by
[1:59:01] god's grace
[1:59:04] breakthroughs are wonderful
[1:59:06] when you overcome something
[1:59:09] it's wonderful
[1:59:11] hallelujah
[1:59:12] because i used to drink
[1:59:14] and when god gave me grace to overcome
[1:59:17] it
[1:59:18] it doesn't bother me anymore
[1:59:21] i'm not tempted
[1:59:23] i can literally drink
[1:59:25] a communion wine
[1:59:27] without wanting to get some bottle or
[1:59:29] something
[1:59:31] y'all understand what i'm saying
[1:59:33] when you overcome something that means
[1:59:35] god takes the very desire out of your
[1:59:38] life
[1:59:40] hallelujah and don't tell me he's not
[1:59:43] able he's more than able
[1:59:45] hallelujah is that right
[1:59:48] yes because he called he listened he
[1:59:50] took a woman a woman who had seven mary
[1:59:54] magdalene has seven spirits
[1:59:58] hallelujah is that right
[2:00:01] seven demons
[2:00:03] and each one of those demons represented
[2:00:05] the church age
[2:00:06] [Applause]
[2:00:08] is the truth
[2:00:09] every church age had to overcome a
[2:00:11] certain devil
[2:00:13] hallelujah and understanding this age
[2:00:16] you have to overcome seven of them
[2:00:20] oh god help us jesus but when you
[2:00:23] overcome it you are free
[2:00:28] hallelujah no man will ever be able to
[2:00:31] put you into bondage again because you
[2:00:34] are free
[2:00:35] and you understand your freedom
[2:00:40] hallelujah
[2:00:41] hallelujah
[2:00:43] hallelujah
[2:00:45] yeah
[2:00:46] everywhere i go
[2:00:48] you know people want to
[2:00:50] really shut you down
[2:00:52] but uh you know what i'm sorry
[2:00:54] god done gay first of all god gave me a
[2:00:56] godly mother
[2:00:58] who showed me that jesus christ was real
[2:01:01] hallelujah she showed me he was alive
[2:01:04] and i went to all of these churches and
[2:01:06] i saw all the hypocrisy and i says oh
[2:01:08] god whatever you do don't make me a
[2:01:09] hypocrite if you're going to save me
[2:01:12] save me to the uttermost
[2:01:15] hallel y'all hear what i'm saying
[2:01:18] you know so i i i know what god can do
[2:01:21] let me move on by god's grace see but
[2:01:24] you see
[2:01:25] she was the one that made me know that
[2:01:27] christianity was real
[2:01:30] my daddy was a muslim
[2:01:33] i could have gone that way
[2:01:35] but i saw christ in my mom
[2:01:38] i saw miracles in my mom
[2:01:40] i saw my mom listen
[2:01:43] don't tell me she could not even read or
[2:01:45] write
[2:01:47] but she knew how to call on jesus
[2:01:51] yes
[2:01:52] and what i'm trying to say is that's why
[2:01:55] i learned this message is not
[2:01:57] intellectual
[2:01:59] hallelujah they make it intellectual but
[2:02:02] that's not it
[2:02:04] hallelujah have you received the holy
[2:02:07] ghost since you believe
[2:02:10] hallelujah
[2:02:12] hallelujah yeah you can't get rid of the
[2:02:14] holy ghost you get rid of the holy ghost
[2:02:16] you get rid of everything hallelujah you
[2:02:18] love the lord
[2:02:19] let me i'm trying to go on because i
[2:02:21] want you to understand by god's grace
[2:02:24] amen that it's impossible
[2:02:27] it's impossible
[2:02:29] for the very elect to be deceived
[2:02:33] and i'ma explain that that's not because
[2:02:34] of your intellect
[2:02:37] that's because god sent a message
[2:02:39] he sent a message that opened our
[2:02:41] understanding to who the devil is and
[2:02:43] what he was made out of and therefore we
[2:02:46] could see and then the systems that
[2:02:48] surrounds us and we don't have to worry
[2:02:51] about the mark of the beast because we
[2:02:53] know we're not a part of it
[2:02:56] and there's something that grounds us so
[2:02:58] much so that we know that we'll never
[2:03:01] submit to it
[2:03:03] oh
[2:03:05] so y'all better understand
[2:03:07] because you don't call yourself a
[2:03:09] denomination doesn't mean that you're
[2:03:11] not a system
[2:03:15] hallelujah
[2:03:16] cain was a systematic worshiper
[2:03:20] you hear what i'm saying
[2:03:21] he did it just like he thought he should
[2:03:24] do it amen and he did a good job at it
[2:03:27] but he did not have the revelation
[2:03:30] and i'm going to something and secondly
[2:03:32] he did not have the bloodline
[2:03:35] you better hear what i'm saying because
[2:03:38] really that was the thing that made him
[2:03:40] do what he did he did not have the right
[2:03:44] bloodline
[2:03:45] whoa
[2:03:47] adam no doubt was a sheep
[2:03:50] and when he produced amen abel he was a
[2:03:53] sheep he was a lamb now i'm talking
[2:03:56] about nature now hallelujah because
[2:03:58] listen before adam fell
[2:04:01] he had the mind of god
[2:04:04] he knew what what god wanted to name
[2:04:06] those animals
[2:04:07] hallelujah because if you search the
[2:04:09] scriptures god had already named them
[2:04:11] but adam caught the thought
[2:04:13] holly oh come on somebody you may have
[2:04:16] heard this before but i'm trying to
[2:04:18] bring this to you
[2:04:20] you must come into that place where you
[2:04:22] can hear the mind of god
[2:04:27] and you'll know exactly what he wants to
[2:04:30] do
[2:04:30] is that right that's what he said he
[2:04:33] said the bride of jesus christ she has
[2:04:35] thus said the lord she knows what to do
[2:04:38] with the word hallelujah not because of
[2:04:40] her intellect and because how she
[2:04:42] figures it out
[2:04:44] but because she's connected
[2:04:48] she's connected he said this day will
[2:04:50] not take you as a thief
[2:04:53] hallelujah you'll know
[2:04:55] it's not going to take you as a thief
[2:05:00] and one of the things that people don't
[2:05:01] understand is that
[2:05:02] god wants to live in you
[2:05:06] but sometimes we think god want to work
[2:05:08] work a a plan of uh
[2:05:11] where he could have a duplex god ain't
[2:05:14] no duplex
[2:05:16] it ain't god and you
[2:05:18] you've got to die and rot
[2:05:22] to yourself
[2:05:23] hallelujah you've got to die and rot
[2:05:28] to yourself in order for god to live
[2:05:32] god ain't no no body system
[2:05:35] [Music]
[2:05:38] y'all hear what i'm saying
[2:05:40] i want you to understand so you and i
[2:05:42] must understand there's work to do
[2:05:45] you say oh brother don't don't don't
[2:05:47] don't don't die down on me
[2:05:49] my point is i'm trying to bring us to a
[2:05:50] place
[2:05:52] you need to know amen you know how let
[2:05:54] me say it like this if you talk to a
[2:05:56] woman or a boy girl whoever they mean
[2:05:58] and you say you're so stupid
[2:06:00] you just stupid
[2:06:02] and you keep saying it to that child
[2:06:05] they're going to believe they're stupid
[2:06:07] they're going to start acting like
[2:06:09] they're stupid
[2:06:11] hallelujah you understand me oh you you
[2:06:14] know you you you tell a boy you're just
[2:06:16] too sissified you're just sissified
[2:06:20] eventually he's gonna start acting like
[2:06:21] a little
[2:06:23] why you're cursing him
[2:06:27] hallelujah god is not giving out curses
[2:06:30] to his bride he's giving out blessings
[2:06:33] hallelujah see that's what when we was
[2:06:36] in the denomination in the organization
[2:06:38] they gave us a mixed tree they gave us
[2:06:40] evil and good is that right but jesus
[2:06:44] came along and he said make the tree
[2:06:45] either good or evil
[2:06:47] hallelujah but you see they say oh you
[2:06:50] got to do this if you want to get to
[2:06:51] heaven you got to do this if you want to
[2:06:53] get to heaven you got to do this and
[2:06:54] they made us work
[2:06:58] hallelujah is that the truth
[2:07:01] oh it's the truth every wednesday we had
[2:07:03] a fast day
[2:07:05] i didn't feel like fasting on wednesdays
[2:07:10] but i would do it because it was the law
[2:07:14] one day i was in i was going to the
[2:07:16] university of south carolina at the time
[2:07:18] i was walking down the street to the bus
[2:07:20] stop and i saw this old faithful sister
[2:07:23] coming out the ice cream parlor
[2:07:27] on a wednesday
[2:07:30] she didn't drop dead
[2:07:33] and i feel if i got me a cone i wouldn't
[2:07:35] either
[2:07:40] hello
[2:07:42] yes sir
[2:07:44] it was a law that was unnecessary
[2:07:48] we're led by the spirit
[2:07:51] [Music]
[2:07:52] glory to god and i'm gonna tell you
[2:07:54] something those kind of laws when you're
[2:07:56] not you're not led by the spirit to do
[2:07:57] it it's a hard day

[2:08:21] that's not unto the lord you're supposed
[2:08:23] to be in a place of meditation
[2:08:26] consecration
[2:08:27] hallelujah not waiting till the six
[2:08:29] o'clock bell ring and then you go in
[2:08:31] there and you eat to your heart
[2:08:34] [Music]

[2:08:44] oh my god have mercy on me
[2:08:47] oh i can remember the time brother i
[2:08:49] listen and i don't know how it was done
[2:08:51] i fasted about 15 16 days i lost track
[2:08:55] you know in the pentecost today
[2:08:57] apostolic whatever you call it
[2:08:59] you didn't drink water
[2:09:02] and don't ask me how i did it
[2:09:05] i did a lot of showering so i figured
[2:09:06] maybe the water went through the skin
[2:09:10] [Laughter]
[2:09:12] kept my teeth brushed so i could you
[2:09:13] know amen that's what i think that's
[2:09:16] what happened god preserved me in my
[2:09:18] ignorance
[2:09:22] i want to get close to god that ain't it
[2:09:26] when you get close to god you believe
[2:09:28] his word
[2:09:29] take god it is what that's how you get
[2:09:32] closer to him

[2:09:36] you
[2:09:37] hallelujah y'all got me preaching all
[2:09:38] off my nose
[2:09:41] hallelujah but let me say it like this
[2:09:44] one thing about the bride of jesus
[2:09:45] christ
[2:09:47] you are a special class of people
[2:09:50] you are a different species
[2:09:56] oh somebody should have shouted
[2:09:59] you are different you are god-kind
[2:10:04] you're baptized when god gives you the
[2:10:06] holy ghost he changes your dna

[2:10:14] i must have it well you're gonna have it
[2:10:17] and you're gonna keep it
[2:10:19] because you're not denying it
[2:10:24] god will work on you through the word
[2:10:27] now i'm not talking about moving in god
[2:10:30] presumptuously i'm saying it comes by
[2:10:33] faith and revelation and when you
[2:10:35] connect with god and god tells you you
[2:10:38] healed
[2:10:39] anybody know what i'm talking about when
[2:10:42] god says you heal not the preacher not
[2:10:44] the deacon but you hear it from inside
[2:10:47] and when god said you healed that's all
[2:10:50] you need
[2:10:51] [Applause]
[2:10:52] people say are you crazy no i'm not
[2:10:55] if he's healed me i don't care what it
[2:10:57] looks like i'm healed
[2:11:02] oh help me jesus you know what i'm
[2:11:04] saying
[2:11:05] connecting with god
[2:11:08] hallelujah we was on the radio the phone
[2:11:10] today and we went into an area i
[2:11:12] couldn't even hear the brother that was
[2:11:14] you know talking long distance well
[2:11:15] that's not light with god
[2:11:18] because first of all god don't speak
[2:11:20] long distance
[2:11:22] [Music]
[2:11:24] hello
[2:11:26] god is in you
[2:11:28] hey man he said don't say i'm up into
[2:11:30] heaven and don't say i'm going to fire
[2:11:31] off he said i'm naughty
[2:11:33] even in you
[2:11:35] i'm in you
[2:11:39] hallelujah i think a lot of times people
[2:11:41] think like i said this is where we
[2:11:43] thought and you know it's the truth oh
[2:11:44] that nobody could outshout me
[2:11:47] no nobody could out dance me
[2:11:50] no no no no no
[2:11:55] it's the truth i don't think there was a
[2:11:57] song that they played or sang i went up
[2:12:01] you know and the thing about it is they
[2:12:03] got mad at me because they said you were
[2:12:04] shouting i was shouting too much
[2:12:06] but you don't know where he brought me
[2:12:08] from
[2:12:12] you see you you don't know my story
[2:12:15] you know what i mean that's what people
[2:12:17] don't understand they judge you and say
[2:12:18] well that ain't necessary maybe it may
[2:12:20] not be necessary for you maybe it's not
[2:12:23] but i'm enjoying it
[2:12:24] [Music]
[2:12:26] right absolutely absolutely you know
[2:12:29] it's like like this and one of the
[2:12:31] things you know people do and i'm going
[2:12:32] on with the word now but let me use this
[2:12:34] one more illustration you know it's like
[2:12:36] when you a baby is eating a piece of
[2:12:38] candy
[2:12:41] and and you know that baby know it's
[2:12:43] good
[2:12:48] when you see him with that candy you
[2:12:49] might as well let him eat it
[2:12:52] you know what you know what we think
[2:12:54] well he that whole piece of candy he's
[2:12:56] going to be running here and there he's
[2:12:58] going to be bouncing off the wall
[2:13:01] but that's one of his pleasures
[2:13:05] he can't he can't enjoy steaks
[2:13:08] you know he can't enjoy a lot of other
[2:13:10] things but when it comes to that little
[2:13:11] lollipop or whatever oh my goodness and
[2:13:13] listen what happens when you try to take
[2:13:15] it from him
[2:13:17] he becomes a holy roller
[2:13:21] [Laughter]
[2:13:23] right he's going to fall he's going to
[2:13:26] scream he's going to roll you're going
[2:13:28] to know even though he can't tell you
[2:13:30] one word
[2:13:33] he's crying his body language is going
[2:13:35] to tell you he did not appreciate that
[2:13:39] and you know that i know that those
[2:13:42] babies would say to themselves in their
[2:13:44] mind ye i can't hardly wait till i get
[2:13:46] bigger
[2:13:50] yeah because they knew if they had what
[2:13:52] they feel inside they would you know me
[2:13:57] you see what i'm saying and that's how
[2:13:59] it is about the joy of the lord don't
[2:14:01] come taking my joy
[2:14:03] if i want to dance let me dance if i
[2:14:06] want to shout let me shout if i want to
[2:14:08] run let me run if whatever i want to do
[2:14:12] in the name of the lord jesus christ let
[2:14:14] me do it
[2:14:16] don't bother me
[2:14:18] hallelujah i don't care if the whole
[2:14:20] church is stiff and starchy let me do it
[2:14:27] you know what i'm saying the reason why
[2:14:29] i'm saying this because you go to most
[2:14:30] message churches now they don't even
[2:14:32] dance no more
[2:14:33] what kind of stuff is that
[2:14:36] what kind of stuff
[2:14:38] evidently the book ain't open to them
[2:14:41] because when john saw the book open the
[2:14:43] bible said amen john
[2:14:45] shouted
[2:14:47] he leaped
[2:14:48] the whole heaven heard him i don't know
[2:14:50] how it happened but every dimension of
[2:14:53] heaven
[2:14:54] every dimension god had created heard
[2:14:57] john saying
[2:14:59] hey
[2:15:00] where are they
[2:15:04] you hear what i'm saying
[2:15:05] and then we come up in here with this
[2:15:07] mighty message of god and you can see
[2:15:09] god changing you
[2:15:11] how many of y'all know that i can see
[2:15:12] him changing me
[2:15:14] things that i couldn't overcome and
[2:15:16] things that i had in my life he's
[2:15:17] constantly moving out of my way
[2:15:20] hallelujah you hear what i'm saying it's
[2:15:22] not me it's christ in me the hope of
[2:15:25] glory it's not you it's christ in you
[2:15:30] some of y'all amen still trying to
[2:15:32] figure out whether you got the holy
[2:15:33] ghost what brought you here
[2:15:37] hallelujah y'all understand me
[2:15:39] what brought you here
[2:15:41] something brought you here
[2:15:42] maybe it's not the matured but you got
[2:15:45] something
[2:15:46] somewhere beginning has started
[2:15:49] hallelujah and the problem is we don't
[2:15:51] know how to feed it
[2:15:53] hallelujah
[2:15:54] you know how you feed it
[2:15:56] you worship the word
[2:16:00] hallelujah
[2:16:01] oh come on somebody you put a little
[2:16:03] spoon full of good stuff oh most baby
[2:16:06] loves applesauce or peaches
[2:16:10] some of y'all don't remember do ya
[2:16:13] but in my day we didn't have it coming
[2:16:15] in a
[2:16:16] jar we were the food processors
[2:16:22] y'all don't remember that
[2:16:24] i had to do it
[2:16:30] [Music]
[2:16:32] oh those kids would get mad if they knew
[2:16:35] we did them that way
[2:16:36] hallelujah but that was the way baby
[2:16:40] food didn't come in a job when i was
[2:16:42] little
[2:16:43] you had to process it at home then they
[2:16:46] got those little machine they start
[2:16:48] mashing it up but before they had those
[2:16:50] little machines you mash it up with your
[2:16:51] mouth
[2:16:52] [Music]
[2:16:55] oh it's nothing but the truth they came
[2:16:58] out healthier
[2:17:01] oh glory to god let me move on by god's
[2:17:03] grace so you real i'm trying to build
[2:17:05] something here
[2:17:07] because i'm just so tired of the people
[2:17:09] of god being defeated
[2:17:12] you gotta you gotta start holding on to
[2:17:14] this word with dear life
[2:17:16] you know all of these little things that
[2:17:18] we've allowed satan to dupe us in in
[2:17:20] years you gotta stop that's that's
[2:17:23] nonsense
[2:17:24] you know and you know how we say when
[2:17:26] when one of our teenagers started acting
[2:17:28] like the child boy grow up
[2:17:33] you don't have to act like that
[2:17:35] grow up
[2:17:36] and this is what god is telling us grow
[2:17:38] up
[2:17:41] paul said when i was a child i spake
[2:17:43] like a child i understood like a child
[2:17:46] hallelujah but when that which is
[2:17:49] purpose is come right you begin to think
[2:17:52] like a grown-up
[2:17:54] hallelujah i've grown up take charges
[2:17:59] oh yeah
[2:18:01] when something go wrong they see to it
[2:18:05] right that's why the kids run to their
[2:18:06] mama mama daddy daddy look look look and
[2:18:09] then you take charge
[2:18:10] well now god is saying you take charge
[2:18:15] that's not the will of god yes it is
[2:18:18] when jesus taught those disciples amen
[2:18:21] for years and when the storm came
[2:18:24] here he was laying in the boat
[2:18:27] and they were still acting like children
[2:18:31] master wake up like we do him sometime
[2:18:34] carrieth thou not that we perish you
[2:18:38] don't understand he might have been
[2:18:40] sleeping in the flesh but god never
[2:18:42] sleeps nor does he slumber in the spirit
[2:18:45] [Applause]
[2:18:48] hallelujah
[2:18:49] we've got such a oh word i let's like i
[2:18:52] told you the other night i said you know
[2:18:54] when i was saying lord let that will be
[2:18:56] done in earth and i'm doing this again
[2:18:58] so maybe he'll do it again
[2:19:00] honestly just for a moment time i
[2:19:02] thought i was raptured
[2:19:04] literally everything a power surge to me
[2:19:07] i was in a light that was just wonderful
[2:19:09] and it
[2:19:10] nobody saw it but me
[2:19:12] i don't even know how to explain it
[2:19:13] because it happened so quickly
[2:19:15] but i know it happened
[2:19:17] hallelujah i'll never be the same again
[2:19:21] i saw a holiness i can't even comprehend
[2:19:24] with my mind but i know that's where i'm
[2:19:26] going
[2:19:28] that's where he's taking me to
[2:19:31] that's where he's taking us to is that
[2:19:33] right
[2:19:35] hallelujah even the holy ghost that
[2:19:37] we've got is not like what we're going
[2:19:40] to experience in heaven
[2:19:42] hallelujah as it descends it comes
[2:19:44] through all kinds of perversion amen but
[2:19:47] when he gets to us it's just a small
[2:19:48] little
[2:19:49] part of him
[2:19:51] oh
[2:19:52] my
[2:19:54] but that small part now
[2:19:56] he's taking over
[2:19:58] he's a tree growing
[2:20:00] the tree of life growing in me
[2:20:03] growing in you hallelujah is that right
[2:20:07] you can you are a species that cannot
[2:20:10] die
[2:20:16] i you know when i get to heaven you know
[2:20:17] who i want to talk to enoch
[2:20:20] i want to talk to enoch and says
[2:20:22] what was it see because one thing for
[2:20:24] sure enoch didn't have a book
[2:20:27] he didn't have a scroll
[2:20:29] hallelujah but the bible said he walked
[2:20:31] with god
[2:20:32] what happened in his spirit he was
[2:20:34] connected
[2:20:36] with god he didn't let the world events
[2:20:40] and all of the things that going on in
[2:20:42] the world he never let that bother him
[2:20:44] he kept his mind on god and whatever god
[2:20:48] told him to do he did it
[2:20:50] so let me tell you this stuff that's
[2:20:52] going on in the world it's there to
[2:20:54] distract you
[2:20:59] it ain't our stuff
[2:21:01] oh come on it's not our stuff
[2:21:05] do you think noah was on the ark worried
[2:21:08] about the politics and the things that
[2:21:10] were going on once he was in the ark
[2:21:16] oh some of y'all i know y'all don't like
[2:21:18] what i'm saying but it's distracting you
[2:21:20] because i'm gonna tell you something if
[2:21:22] you watch that stuff evil spirits gonna
[2:21:24] jump on you and you who have never been
[2:21:27] racist you're going to become racist
[2:21:33] it's the truth you start hating people
[2:21:35] you don't even know
[2:21:41] people i'm telling you you got to stop
[2:21:42] that stuff that devil is trying to
[2:21:44] destroy your character keep your eyes
[2:21:47] focused on jesus
[2:21:50] because listen there ain't a thing you
[2:21:52] can do this is all purpose by god
[2:21:56] hallelujah for who you to get you
[2:21:59] prepared for a rapture
[2:22:01] hallelujah one morning god woke me up
[2:22:04] and told me to turn to genesis 6 he said
[2:22:07] we are now here in genesis 6 and when he
[2:22:10] did that the violence broke out in
[2:22:12] america
[2:22:14] like it's never been before
[2:22:16] and let me tell you something it's not
[2:22:18] all over
[2:22:22] this is just the beginning
[2:22:24] and you and i have no idea where it's
[2:22:26] going but i'm gonna tell you something
[2:22:28] you better be in christ
[2:22:30] hallelujah you better know god because
[2:22:33] if you don't know god you'll miss this
[2:22:35] rapture
[2:22:38] hallelujah
[2:22:40] is that the truth it's the truth i'm
[2:22:42] trying to tell listen god speaks to me
[2:22:45] and i'm telling you what he told me
[2:22:47] you got to keep and i do look at stuff
[2:22:49] but you know what when i see that thing
[2:22:51] in such a way i back off of it
[2:22:55] i back up off it because it's just it's
[2:22:57] just yeah confusion and everybody lying
[2:23:01] you say how you know it because my
[2:23:02] prophet said they're both rotten to the
[2:23:04] core
[2:23:08] [Music]
[2:23:12] and to be honest with you you can't be
[2:23:13] righteous and holy without the holy
[2:23:14] ghost
[2:23:16] let me go on by god's grace you know you
[2:23:19] love the lord
[2:23:20] listen he said god by his death and this
[2:23:23] is why i except see people we fail to
[2:23:26] see amen how we got here
[2:23:29] you know you couldn't get here without
[2:23:31] calvary
[2:23:33] you don't even hear calvary talked about
[2:23:35] much
[2:23:36] the blood of jesus christ and his dying
[2:23:38] and suffering
[2:23:40] well how people gonna get to the holy
[2:23:41] ghost or how they're gonna even be saved
[2:23:43] if they don't know what it took to bring
[2:23:46] their salvation
[2:23:49] people don't talk about the blood that
[2:23:51] was shared
[2:23:52] you hardly even hear the songs about it
[2:23:54] anymore
[2:23:56] [Music]
[2:23:58] hallelujah but you better understand
[2:24:00] that's where your salvation is because
[2:24:02] the bible said without the shedding of
[2:24:04] blood there is no remission of sin
[2:24:08] hallelujah how are you gonna get rid of
[2:24:10] and get away from the blood when the
[2:24:12] book was opened the lamb came and what
[2:24:14] it when when john looked to see
[2:24:17] the voice of a lion he looked and he saw
[2:24:19] a lamb bloodied
[2:24:21] bloody lamb
[2:24:23] hallelujah as it had been slain from the
[2:24:26] foundation of the world
[2:24:28] hallelujah it's still the blood
[2:24:31] you can say it any kind of way you want
[2:24:32] to well it's the life of the blood yes
[2:24:35] it's always been the life of the blood
[2:24:39] none of us have had any kind of vows or
[2:24:41] anything with the blood of jesus it's
[2:24:43] always been the life
[2:24:47] hallelujah
[2:24:48] oh god help us here let me read this
[2:24:50] here quickly just to slow down a little
[2:24:52] bit i i'm really excited because i want
[2:24:55] you to understand who you are
[2:24:58] you're not a pushover
[2:25:00] you are a christian
[2:25:02] forget about what you used to be
[2:25:04] god has transformed you
[2:25:07] don't let the devil take your mind back
[2:25:10] to where you used to be because that's
[2:25:12] not you and if you got the holy ghost
[2:25:15] the bible said you are a new creature a
[2:25:18] new creation all things are passed away
[2:25:21] and behold all things have become new i
[2:25:24] believe that
[2:25:26] i don't care how to never come with me
[2:25:28] and try to bring me take me down memory
[2:25:30] lane you know what i'm saying he'll do
[2:25:32] it
[2:25:33] but listen i put a stop to him
[2:25:36] sometimes he'll catch you off guard
[2:25:39] and then you have to somebody said what
[2:25:41] do you do i said you shake your head
[2:25:43] because that's where he's at he's on top
[2:25:45] of your head
[2:25:47] shake him off
[2:25:49] confuse him a little bit
[2:25:50] and then when you shake your head you
[2:25:52] get focused
[2:25:53] anybody know what i'm talking about
[2:25:56] yes
[2:25:57] thoughts come in and you feel something
[2:25:59] and all of a sudden a vision break he
[2:26:00] gives you something i don't know what
[2:26:02] that is he gives you but you begin to
[2:26:03] see things you got to shake your head
[2:26:06] and say devil that's you that ain't me
[2:26:09] you know how i know it's me when it's
[2:26:11] coming from my heart
[2:26:13] you understand me
[2:26:15] when evil comes from your heart it's you
[2:26:19] when it's coming from your head that's
[2:26:21] just a battle
[2:26:23] between good and evil
[2:26:27] hallelujah the bible didn't say as a man
[2:26:29] thinketh in his head he says has a man
[2:26:31] thinketh in his heart
[2:26:34] anyway let me
[2:26:36] anyway let me let me stop before
[2:26:38] you got to understand amen that here is
[2:26:40] his death he shares his blood what he
[2:26:43] bought back his own
[2:26:45] now how many of you believe you his own
[2:26:50] i'm gonna ask that a question again
[2:26:52] because i didn't see enough hands
[2:26:55] how many people believe that you are the
[2:26:57] you are his own
[2:26:59] oh all right all right cause the devil
[2:27:00] needs to see those hands
[2:27:02] he needs to see that you know that you
[2:27:04] who you are you know
[2:27:06] so anyway you look and he said he
[2:27:08] brought back listen the spoken word seed
[2:27:11] and this is where i'm going
[2:27:13] because i want you to understand when
[2:27:14] the prophet of god was here he was an
[2:27:16] example of where god was taking us
[2:27:19] hallelujah and some of the phenomenal
[2:27:22] things that god did through him i still
[2:27:24] stand in awe
[2:27:26] but one of the things was when god
[2:27:29] told him to speak squirrels into
[2:27:31] existence
[2:27:32] now see what we must understand that the
[2:27:35] bride
[2:27:36] amen when she becomes god our god part
[2:27:39] of god however you want to say it i want
[2:27:40] to i want to say it in a way that people
[2:27:42] don't think i'm blaspheming but if a
[2:27:44] horse have a horse he's a horse
[2:27:46] the car have a car as a cow and if god
[2:27:49] have a son he's a god
[2:27:51] you understand me he's offspring he's
[2:27:53] what you are is who you are now you got
[2:27:55] to believe that
[2:27:57] you've got to believe that not with your
[2:28:01] head with your heart
[2:28:03] you see so anyway when god comes along
[2:28:05] and he takes a kentuckian like he did
[2:28:08] and began to work things within him amen
[2:28:11] and and make him something that he
[2:28:12] didn't even know he was
[2:28:15] until down the road
[2:28:17] you understand me
[2:28:18] and he
[2:28:19] god
[2:28:20] you know
[2:28:21] now that's when it gets good
[2:28:24] when god finds favor with you
[2:28:27] he didn't ask for the squirrels
[2:28:29] god came and brought the conversation up
[2:28:34] you know what i'm saying i can see how
[2:28:36] you know enoch pleased him so much and
[2:28:38] you know he's walking alone whether
[2:28:40] occasionally being god walking with
[2:28:41] enoch and then god brings up the rapture
[2:28:45] you know however it was i don't know but
[2:28:47] one thing for certain see when you walk
[2:28:49] right with god god start talking to you
[2:28:52] he fellowship because this the whole
[2:28:54] means for the blood to restore
[2:28:57] fellowship
[2:28:59] you see and so when he's fellowshipping
[2:29:01] with you he'll begin to talk with you
[2:29:03] he'll begin to say things to you nobody
[2:29:05] else can hear
[2:29:08] hallelujah
[2:29:10] and then brother said he wanted so many
[2:29:12] squirrels
[2:29:14] but the beautiful thing about it
[2:29:16] he didn't have nothing
[2:29:18] to work with
[2:29:20] greater
[2:29:22] things will you do
[2:29:26] and what happened he you know jesus had
[2:29:28] water to work with to turn to wine
[2:29:30] he had bread to multiply
[2:29:33] hallelujah
[2:29:34] you know what i'm saying he did a he did
[2:29:36] some things now i mean he he created
[2:29:39] fish
[2:29:41] right because peter said hey we've been
[2:29:43] here all night ain't no fish out there
[2:29:46] you say go back
[2:29:48] cast your net and somehow fish came
[2:29:52] where do you think they came from
[2:29:54] that same god that produced that ram in
[2:29:57] the bush over there with abraham is the
[2:30:00] same god that lives in us
[2:30:04] hallelujah i'm loving it
[2:30:10] and so you and i must understand this is
[2:30:13] the kind of a people he's looking for
[2:30:15] this is what the message came for for a
[2:30:17] people that can believe that these
[2:30:20] things are for you
[2:30:25] let this mind be in you that was also in
[2:30:27] christ jesus who thought it not robbery
[2:30:28] to be equal with god
[2:30:30] hallelujah you didn't do it he's doing
[2:30:33] it in you
[2:30:35] christ jesus the hope of glory

[2:30:41] i am in the father the father's in me
[2:30:43] and i am in you
[2:30:45] it's not you that do the work it's
[2:30:47] christ in you doing the work it wasn't
[2:30:50] william branham it was god in him doing
[2:30:52] the work
[2:30:56] but that's the kind of people he's
[2:30:57] looking for
[2:31:01] i was thinking about my sister and she
[2:31:03] was telling me and i'm gonna let you go
[2:31:05] in just a minute
[2:31:07] but you know

[2:31:21] gate opened up for him and
[2:31:23] stuff like that and

[2:31:29] and you know how many times you've lost
[2:31:31] keys or something and i said lord you
[2:31:33] know where they are

[2:33:30] the devil knows it
[2:33:34] he knew jesus was supernatural
[2:33:37] he did say hey if you be the christ turn
[2:33:40] the stone into bread

[2:33:45] because of the god that was in him and
[2:33:48] god knows the devil know when you get
[2:33:50] god in you you're capable of doing

[2:34:23] that it's all natural
[2:34:25] no no we're supernatural now
[2:34:28] we're supernatural we believe the
[2:34:30] impossible

[2:34:38] not a pig
[2:34:40] neither will you be a dog turned into a
[2:34:42] sheep he said that is impossible for ev
[2:34:45] every kind of life produces the same
[2:34:47] kind and there is no change in species
[2:34:52] so you got to understand if you are of
[2:34:55] god kind he can't make you less
[2:34:59] you can't be hybrid
[2:35:02] y'all understand me ain't nothing mixing
[2:35:04] the word cannot be broken
[2:35:07] is that why is that right the bible said
[2:35:09] who the word came to he said he called
[2:35:12] them gods and the word cannot be broken
[2:35:16] hallelujah and the word has come to you
[2:35:21] oh what i'm trying to say is that you
[2:35:24] once you realize what god has made you
[2:35:27] you become invincible
[2:35:30] you say well what do you mean brother
[2:35:31] brooks you don't even need a tambourine
[2:35:34] to get you all worked up
[2:35:35] what you need is faith to speak the word
[2:35:40] hallelujah you don't have to feel a
[2:35:42] whirlwind you don't even have to feel
[2:35:44] amen goosebump going up and down your
[2:35:47] spine
[2:35:48] you speak the word
[2:35:55] and is
[2:35:57] is that all right
[2:35:59] remember the problem of god there was a
[2:36:00] little babe mexican baby down there
[2:36:02] swollen with the cancer all over it and
[2:36:05] everything else and and and and you know
[2:36:07] he was just waiting on god waiting
[2:36:10] and the little fellow to suffer
[2:36:12] suffering suffering and and all of a
[2:36:14] sudden you know
[2:36:15] he basically said something god can't
[2:36:17] remember exactly what he said and god
[2:36:18] says no but i'm waiting on you
[2:36:23] i'm waiting on you
[2:36:24] what about the opossums she'd been there
[2:36:26] all day waiting on you to pray for
[2:36:29] i'm waiting on you
[2:36:33] if he wasn't he wouldn't rebuke those
[2:36:34] disciples
[2:36:36] he said oh gee of little faith
[2:36:38] where did you doubt
[2:36:40] laying there waiting on them
[2:36:43] [Music]
[2:36:44] when he had already given them the
[2:36:46] commission to do it
[2:36:49] he's given you the commission to do it
[2:36:53] y'all heard what i said last night and
[2:36:55] i'm going to close in just a little bit
[2:36:56] and then we must understand at the end
[2:36:59] of the day when people see you they must
[2:37:01] see jesus
[2:37:06] they were first called christians at
[2:37:08] antioch not because of the clothes they
[2:37:10] wear it was because of their behavior
[2:37:12] they act like god they talk like god
[2:37:15] they raise dead they heal the sick amend
[2:37:18] eyes of the blind was opened all of
[2:37:20] those things were given to the early
[2:37:22] christian and if we come from the same
[2:37:24] branch and if we are the same branch we
[2:37:26] must produce the same thing
[2:37:30] how are we going to do it
[2:37:33] lord how are we going to do it it seems
[2:37:34] like it's impossible no
[2:37:36] you lay
[2:37:38] in the presence of the sun
[2:37:42] these come by these things don't come by
[2:37:44] you know you just going doing whatever
[2:37:46] you want to do this come from prayers
[2:37:48] and you're laying before the presence of
[2:37:50] the lord
[2:37:51] and god coming in and anointing you
[2:37:54] hallelujah how many times you've said
[2:37:57] just not even thinking about a little
[2:37:59] simple prayer for somebody and they heal
[2:38:01] just like that
[2:38:03] right
[2:38:05] it happens why because you never thought
[2:38:06] about it it's like tying your shoes you
[2:38:08] just tie your shoe
[2:38:09] right sometimes we got to feel like oh
[2:38:11] faith got to come in such a way that i
[2:38:13] got to see this big cloud no
[2:38:15] it's in you
[2:38:17] who is faith
[2:38:19] who is faith
[2:38:21] jesus
[2:38:22] by faith the world was created
[2:38:26] faith is not just a thing it's a person
[2:38:30] [Music]
[2:38:34] and what we need to do is tap into it
[2:38:37] we're still looking all up in heaven
[2:38:40] he you know he's still there you know
[2:38:42] what i'm trying to say you can't just
[2:38:43] put him in a box but if you don't
[2:38:44] recognize him in you
[2:38:46] he said at that day
[2:38:48] you'll know that i'm in the father of
[2:38:50] the fathers in me and i am in you
[2:38:52] now if you can just chew on this like i
[2:38:54] said last night like a cow chewing his
[2:38:56] car you're going to get somewhere
[2:38:59] huh
[2:39:00] and what i'm saying is i know and i'm i
[2:39:02] hope i'm not sounding like i'm fussing
[2:39:03] because i'm not trying to fuss i'm
[2:39:05] screaming i'm yelling because i want to
[2:39:07] get penetrate something in penetrating
[2:39:09] that so you can see to the soul that god
[2:39:12] did not just make us sinners to send us
[2:39:14] to hell
[2:39:15] and god don't send nobody to hell
[2:39:18] we fight our way by way of our own
[2:39:20] choices
[2:39:24] god is real
[2:39:25] and nobody in hell will blame be able to
[2:39:27] blame god because god has it all on on
[2:39:30] film
[2:39:30] he has it all just like hollywood got
[2:39:33] you out there
[2:39:35] god got it all on film
[2:39:37] everything is captured from your very
[2:39:39] thoughts every action you made
[2:39:41] i told my daddy i said daddy i said you
[2:39:44] do not want to go before god like a
[2:39:46] sinner
[2:39:47] well i knew some of the things that my
[2:39:48] daddy had done and they were wicked
[2:39:50] things and i don't know about all the
[2:39:52] things he had done but i knew
[2:39:54] if i was him i would not want to go
[2:39:56] before god
[2:39:57] like that
[2:39:59] and one thing for certain you and i you
[2:40:01] know how we lied to our mom and our dad
[2:40:02] at times said oh no mom i didn't do it
[2:40:05] no no you can't even say that before god
[2:40:08] because not only will you see it but
[2:40:10] everybody else that's looking going to
[2:40:11] see it
[2:40:14] so you don't want that my point is you
[2:40:16] want god to wash away your sins
[2:40:19] you want all those things that you've
[2:40:22] done and you've thought that were wicked
[2:40:24] and evil you want god to clean you from
[2:40:26] all of that
[2:40:28] and on top of that you want god to fill
[2:40:30] you with the holy ghost
[2:40:33] i don't know listen
[2:40:35] i i i
[2:40:36] i tell people i've told god i said god
[2:40:40] you know what
[2:40:42] if i can't go to heaven holy i don't
[2:40:45] want to go
[2:40:47] if i go any kind of way i'm going to
[2:40:48] mess up heaven
[2:40:53] you understand me
[2:40:54] i got to be holy
[2:40:56] i got to be righteous i got to be just
[2:40:58] like because heaven won't be heaven to
[2:40:59] me without it
[2:41:02] you know what if you're a true sinner
[2:41:04] and you go to heaven you won't like it
[2:41:07] ain't nothing there for you to like
[2:41:11] hallelujah
[2:41:13] that's why we can't go to hell
[2:41:15] ain't nothing down there we like
[2:41:20] and you and i must understand we are a
[2:41:22] different breed we are but different
[2:41:24] people we are one blood by christ jesus
[2:41:30] hallelujah i don't know how he does it
[2:41:33] but i know one thing for certain amen

[2:41:38] and i'm taking it brother get you know
[2:41:41] every piece of that bread every piece of
[2:41:42] that word it has he reveals it and gives
[2:41:45] it to me i'm going to eat it i'm going
[2:41:47] to digest it and i am willing to
[2:41:49] to become it
[2:41:51] i want to become what he wants me to
[2:41:54] become
[2:41:55] hallelujah
[2:41:57] you ought to get tired of going to
[2:41:58] burger king and mcdonald's
[2:42:00] that's all this world have to offer eat
[2:42:03] drink and be married
[2:42:05] that's nothing compared to what god has
[2:42:08] for you
[2:42:09] hallelujah we will spend eternity
[2:42:13] enjoying what he's got for us
[2:42:16] there will never be a boring moment
[2:42:19] there there will never be a sad note
[2:42:22] played there is no blues sung in heaven
[2:42:28] hallelujah
[2:42:30] oh my god

[2:43:32] god knew you was going to be here
[2:43:35] this day
[2:43:36] god knew you were going to be here and
[2:43:38] he designed a message just for you

[2:45:47] that's the part i like
[2:45:50] he can't take it back
[2:45:52] once i had my children my wife and i we
[2:45:54] have eight we've got about 17 grand
[2:45:58] but let me say it like this once we had
[2:46:00] our children
[2:46:01] we couldn't take them we couldn't send
[2:46:02] them back
[2:46:08] yeah when they get teens you wish you
[2:46:10] could
[2:46:15] but they're yours
[2:46:18] and you know we always say where did
[2:46:19] they get that from your truth come on
[2:46:21] now come on come on
[2:46:24] i see my children i see me
[2:46:27] i see my sisters i see my brothers
[2:46:30] it's a family affair
[2:46:33] and you wonder how come they act like
[2:46:34] that i got one daughter she looks so
[2:46:37] much like my my younger sister she
[2:46:38] passed away but she looked so much the
[2:46:40] only is the difference is she's got a
[2:46:43] different complexion my my my younger
[2:46:45] sister was really a light yellow like
[2:46:47] skin and this one is i call it chocolate
[2:46:49] you
[2:46:50] know and she looked so much like me when
[2:46:53] she was born it scared me i'm like this
[2:46:55] is a girl
[2:46:59] but that's the way dna works you know
[2:47:02] it comes out that way and i think she
[2:47:04] look more like a mom now but you know
[2:47:06] she came out with that little afro
[2:47:07] [Laughter]

[2:47:14] once the connection has been made
[2:47:19] and that child is conceived
[2:47:22] there's no turning back
[2:47:24] that's how it is with god
[2:47:26] once he's impregnated you

[3:20:36] this

[3:20:41] more than eight hours of sleep in a big
[3:20:43] comfy bed
[3:20:45] there's nothing like that rest and peace
[3:20:48] that comes with his presence
[3:20:51] we ask that the lord would go with you
[3:20:53] everyone right now father
[3:20:55] we thank you for what you're doing we're
[3:20:58] not going to say for what you've done

[3:21:02] you're doing
[3:21:04] and lord we are asking that you would
[3:21:07] meet with us
[3:21:09] even through the night
[3:21:11] that you would speak to hearts and lives
[3:21:15] bring us to that greater
[3:21:17] level of surrender that the prophet
[3:21:19] talked about
[3:21:21] you've gone as far with god as you're
[3:21:23] ever going to go
[3:21:25] until you come to that place
[3:21:28] may it be lord that we step into a
[3:21:31] greater
[3:21:32] level a greater dimension
[3:21:35] of
[3:21:36] surrender so that you can take all of us
[3:21:40] and use us for your glory
[3:21:43] rest bodies
[3:21:45] i pray that the holy ghost will rise up
[3:21:47] in these precious believers
[3:21:50] to silence the voice of the accuser to
[3:21:53] shut down the attack and the assignment
[3:21:56] of the enemy
[3:21:57] and give peace where trouble and turmoil
[3:22:00] and torment has been let peace come
[3:22:04] and take that place fill that void
