[0:51] hello i'm pastor steven shelley and i
[0:54] want to welcome you to this edition of
[0:56] the eagles cry
[0:58] we're just delighted to be able to come
[1:00] to you today wherever you are around the
[1:03] world
[1:04] from our little sanctuary in smith
[1:08] station alabama usa
[1:11] i'm the pastor of the new hope revival
[1:13] ministries and the host of the eagles
[1:15] cry and we're just thankful to god for
[1:18] giving us the opportunity to
[1:20] be able to share with you some of the
[1:22] things that the holy spirit is laid on
[1:24] our heart things that i believe i hope
[1:28] and trust will be an encouragement to
[1:30] you
[1:31] perhaps the lord will use this program
[1:34] to cause you to dig a little deeper into
[1:37] the storehouse of god's
[1:40] word
[1:42] the treasures that have been hidden in
[1:44] darkness
[1:45] god wants us to be able to find those
[1:47] treasures in this hour and to prepare
[1:50] ourselves to move forward
[1:52] into the final chapters
[1:55] of god's plan for planet earth as we
[1:58] know it yes i believe that we are
[2:01] nearing the coming of the lord the
[2:03] consummation of the ages the end of all
[2:06] things
[2:07] i truly believe that we are plunging
[2:10] toward
[2:11] the millennial reign of the lord jesus
[2:14] christ and before that happens the earth
[2:16] is yet to do some more reeling and
[2:19] rocking
[2:20] there are many birth pains that are
[2:23] mentioned in matthew chapter 24 and luke
[2:26] chapter 21 where our lord jesus speaks
[2:30] about the kinds of events that will be
[2:33] taking place on the earth just prior to
[2:36] his coming and to the end of the age
[2:39] many of these things started being
[2:42] fulfilled after immediately after he
[2:45] spoke them
[2:46] and yet many of these things still have
[2:50] a legitimate application and fulfillment
[2:53] in the hour that we're living in
[2:55] and because our lord jesus chose the
[2:57] analogy of a woman giving birth
[3:01] we know that he was telling us
[3:04] in matthew 24 verse 8 when he said all
[3:07] of these things are the beginning of
[3:09] sorrows we know that he was letting us
[3:12] know that there would be a great
[3:14] increase
[3:15] in both frequency and intensity in all
[3:20] of the events that he mentioned
[3:22] preparing us for the end time we will
[3:24] see them increase
[3:27] and we're seeing that and it helps us to
[3:29] know
[3:30] that it's time for the bride of christ
[3:32] to lift up our heads
[3:34] for our redemption draweth nigh
[3:38] and we want to continue our study today
[3:40] we're making our way through a
[3:43] top 10 countdown of biblical events
[3:47] birth pains of the messiah we started at
[3:50] 10 and were counting backward number 10
[3:52] was signs in the sun and the moon and
[3:55] the stars we've covered that already in
[3:58] prior broadcast and then we move on
[4:01] number nine was violence upon the whole
[4:05] earth
[4:06] and we also have covered number nine
[4:08] number eight famines pestilences and
[4:12] earthquakes then number seven nations in
[4:15] distress with perplexity
[4:19] number six false prophets and false
[4:22] teachers if you're hearing the broadcast
[4:25] for the first time today and you'd like
[4:27] to go back and hear the other broadcasts
[4:30] see the other programs in this series
[4:32] check our website at revival.org
[4:36] perhaps there will be some ordering
[4:37] information there and we also have for a
[4:40] small monthly subscription fee
[4:43] a vod system video on demand where you
[4:47] would be able to log in and see all of
[4:50] the episodes in this series on the birth
[4:53] pangs of the messiah and you would also
[4:56] be able to see some other conference
[4:58] sessions where we have spoken around the
[5:00] world and an archive of our local
[5:03] services here at new hope revival
[5:05] ministries so that you could catch up on
[5:07] this series if today is your first time
[5:10] tuning in number five was an increase in
[5:14] technology in the end time according to
[5:17] the prophecy of the prophet daniel
[5:20] today we want to begin to talk about
[5:22] number four in the countdown and that's
[5:25] nations aligning for prophetic
[5:28] fulfillment
[5:30] i want to read psalm 2
[5:32] verses 1 through 3.
[5:35] why do the heathen rage the psalmist
[5:38] said and the people imagine a vain thing
[5:43] the kings of the earth set themselves
[5:46] and the rulers take counsel together
[5:49] against the lord and against his
[5:52] anointed saying let us break their bands
[5:56] asunder and cast away their cords from
[6:00] us
[6:01] these are prophetic words that describe
[6:06] very accurately what's happening in the
[6:09] nations of the world as we speak
[6:12] there is a
[6:14] realignment that is taking place nations
[6:17] are
[6:18] shifting governments are changing
[6:21] regimes are crumbling new regimes are
[6:25] raising up to take their place
[6:28] it appears that
[6:30] one dictator falls and another dictator
[6:33] rises
[6:34] nations are joining together in leagues
[6:38] uh forming different
[6:40] federations and organizations
[6:44] i'm sure that they're doing it in their
[6:46] own consciousness in their own mind
[6:49] they're doing it to better themselves to
[6:51] better their people and so forth but i
[6:53] want you to know that really it is
[6:56] prophesied that these things would
[6:58] happen in unprecedented ways near the
[7:01] coming of the lord nations would shake
[7:04] we experienced some time back the arab
[7:07] spring and uh that this is the the
[7:10] analytical term that the media has used
[7:13] to examine the shiftings that took place
[7:16] in egypt and many other nations of the
[7:19] world
[7:20] these kinds of shiftings are going on
[7:23] still right at this moment some of them
[7:26] we're more aware of than others
[7:30] but we need to pray as i have shared
[7:33] with you here on the broadcast before we
[7:35] the people of god those who are born
[7:37] again of the spirit of truth
[7:40] we have an obligation and a
[7:42] responsibility to pray for the
[7:44] deliverance and the salvation of the
[7:46] nations of the world i believe god has
[7:49] people in every nation who
[7:52] uh
[7:53] really need
[7:54] to be prayed for need strength because
[7:57] they're kind of holding space
[7:59] in nations many of which are under
[8:02] persecution because they
[8:04] fail to follow the national
[8:08] mandated faith or the national mandated
[8:11] religion
[8:12] christians are being persecuted in many
[8:15] nations of the world right now and we
[8:17] need to pray for their safety we need to
[8:20] pray that god will use them to reach the
[8:22] last seed of god
[8:24] before the end time comes we need to
[8:27] also pray that uh at times i believe
[8:30] prayer can hold back a change of
[8:33] leadership that would clamp down on uh
[8:37] even what little bit of access the
[8:39] gospel has to certain regions and areas
[8:42] of different nations
[8:44] i really believe prayer is the key in
[8:46] this hour and we have not only the
[8:49] responsibility to do it we have the
[8:50] authority to to discover supernaturally
[8:55] the mind of god and pray that
[8:57] we do that prophetically we do that by
[9:00] waiting on the lord by listening for his
[9:03] voice and then praying decreeing
[9:06] declaring prophesying
[9:08] all the things that that we feel the
[9:11] spirit of god saying in this hour so
[9:13] nations are shaking and as the old hymn
[9:17] said nations are shaking israel is
[9:20] awakening one of the alignments that we
[9:23] see going on in the world right now are
[9:25] the nations are joining together in
[9:28] their
[9:29] outcry in their persecution and in their
[9:32] threatenings against israel this was
[9:35] prophesied in the scripture that all
[9:38] nations would would rise against israel
[9:41] that they would encompass
[9:43] that tiny little dot on the map and that
[9:46] they would do everything they could to
[9:48] annihilate well there's one thing we
[9:51] know
[9:52] for sure and that is god has a covenant
[9:55] with the jewish people and with the
[9:57] nation of israel you don't have to like
[9:59] it you don't you don't have to jump on
[10:02] the bandwagon but i'm telling you you
[10:04] won't be able to change it because god
[10:07] has determined to keep his word that's
[10:09] the kind of god we serve i believe god
[10:12] loves people of all ethnicities i
[10:15] believe he wants to bring salvation to
[10:17] the gentile nations i believe that with
[10:19] all my heart but i do believe that god
[10:22] has a special covenant not only with the
[10:24] people of israel the jewish people
[10:28] no matter where they're scattered around
[10:29] the world but i believe god made a
[10:31] covenant with the dirt i believe god
[10:33] made a covenant with the land of israel
[10:36] and he has given that to the jewish
[10:38] people and much to the dismay and the
[10:42] anger of of so many nations who who
[10:46] sometimes enemies you know of each other
[10:49] and yet they come together in their
[10:51] hatred they join together at least for
[10:54] their hatred of the nation of israel and
[10:57] we we see such
[10:59] foolish things going on in the united
[11:01] nations uh against israel and and uh so
[11:05] many uh talk the talk
[11:08] including my nation you know we're going
[11:10] to stand with israel we're going to
[11:12] support israel and and so forth but i'm
[11:15] telling you i don't have a lot of
[11:17] confidence in politics
[11:19] because i see that they can say one
[11:22] thing in fact uh talking out of both
[11:24] sides of their mouth so i pray for
[11:27] israel
[11:28] and that's one of the birth pangs of the
[11:30] messiah that we'll talk about before we
[11:32] close this series so i don't want to
[11:35] spend too much time talking about israel
[11:37] today except to say
[11:39] that this this realigning that's taking
[11:42] place you know some are even prophesying
[11:45] the uh
[11:47] the the resurrection i guess you could
[11:49] say of the holy roman empire or at least
[11:53] a revised version of the roman empire
[11:56] and they do it because of some
[12:00] scriptures in the bible that seem to
[12:02] indicate that rome will play a part in
[12:04] the end time i think to believe that
[12:07] rome
[12:08] that the roman empire will be completely
[12:11] revived politically and have a major
[12:14] role uh politically in the world in the
[12:17] end time i think that's probably
[12:20] an error but i do believe that that uh
[12:24] rome will play a part in that system but
[12:27] it's more of a religious system than it
[12:30] is a political system by the time that
[12:32] the religious system and the political
[12:35] system will join together it's going to
[12:37] be
[12:38] uh well it's like we use the expression
[12:41] in the states sometime then it's kind of
[12:42] katy bar the door
[12:44] uh by the time those two systems come
[12:47] together as prophesied in the book of
[12:48] revelation the antichrist is going to be
[12:52] that false messiah is going to be in
[12:55] full swing and the mark of the beast
[12:57] that we read about in the book of
[12:58] revelation is going to be taking hold
[13:01] then
[13:02] and so there is uh there is definitely
[13:06] going to be some some shiftings that
[13:08] will accelerate in the nation's
[13:11] alignments and realignments
[13:14] getting us ready for a time that uh that
[13:17] the antichrist will rule from the city
[13:19] that sets on seven hills according to
[13:22] the scripture i'll leave you to do your
[13:24] research to find out what that's all
[13:26] about we'll talk about it in a later
[13:28] broadcast for sure nations aligning for
[13:32] prophetic fulfillment is number four in
[13:35] our list of the birth pains of messiah
[13:40] some of this
[13:41] we can find in in so many places
[13:44] throughout the older testament and the
[13:46] new testament as well
[13:49] where it talks about the kings of the
[13:51] east which generally refer to china
[13:55] in ezekiel 38 and 39 we hear about the
[13:58] armies of gog and magog
[14:01] and we we we just there's just a lot
[14:04] that's going to happen
[14:05] uh with the nations of the world
[14:09] as we draw near to the coming of the
[14:11] lord so we watch we watch the news we
[14:14] read the newspaper and we see these
[14:16] things unfolding it's hard to know
[14:19] everything that's going to happen uh but
[14:21] the one thing we need to know is god is
[14:24] watching all of this he is you know
[14:27] nothing is going to happen in the world
[14:29] that's going to catch god by surprise he
[14:32] never has that aha moment i i didn't see
[14:35] that one coming that never happens to
[14:38] god he is omniscient he has all
[14:41] knowledge and he knows the end from the
[14:44] beginning and everything in between so
[14:47] if you have committed your life to him
[14:50] if you are anchored in the rock of ages
[14:53] then no matter what happens around you
[14:56] the nation shaking the heathen raging um
[14:59] the threats of of nuclear warfare
[15:02] whatever it might be there is a place of
[15:05] safety in our relationship with the lord
[15:08] jesus christ and i believe that i'm
[15:11] preaching that because i believe it
[15:13] there's no better place no safer place
[15:16] to be than in the messiah and we come
[15:19] into the messiah when we acknowledge our
[15:22] sin and our
[15:24] unrighteousness and we repent and we
[15:27] claim lay our claim to god's
[15:29] righteousness when we hold on to him and
[15:32] say i'm filthy i'm unworthy i'm undone
[15:35] without you but with you i am complete
[15:39] and truly we are complete with the lord
[15:41] jesus christ number three
[15:44] what the third
[15:46] uh
[15:47] birth pain of the messiah that's
[15:49] mentioned in scripture
[15:50] uh or at least the third category is
[15:53] apostasy and this apostasy will
[15:57] eventually
[15:59] swing into a one world church system
[16:04] forming
[16:05] uh it it has its
[16:08] roots today in in an ecumenical push
[16:12] to blur the lines between different
[16:15] faiths
[16:17] um
[16:19] merging them together for the sake of
[16:22] tolerance at least that's what they say
[16:25] but really there's an agenda that is a
[16:28] whole lot deeper than what we we're
[16:30] hearing about it's not just for the sake
[16:34] of unity and peace it's actually for the
[16:37] sake of introducing the world to the
[16:40] antichrist system that's what we see
[16:42] happening right now
[16:44] there is such compromise in the church
[16:47] world today
[16:48] we uh are
[16:50] in general
[16:52] sin is no longer preached against i i
[16:55] mean let's just be honest
[16:57] because if we preach against sin we're
[16:59] called intolerant and hate hate mongers
[17:04] if we preach against sin because people
[17:06] have a difficulty differentiating
[17:08] between sin and the sinner we need to do
[17:11] that it's the body of christ we love the
[17:14] sinner but we've got to hate the sin if
[17:17] god hates it we have to hate it and for
[17:20] the sake of crowds and for the sake of
[17:22] finances the church at large has
[17:25] compromised on the preaching of the
[17:27] gospel which has caused us to be in the
[17:30] condition we're in right now which are
[17:32] which i would call the advanced stages
[17:35] of an apostasy that started many many
[17:38] years ago
[17:39] thank god the word has been restored to
[17:42] the bride of christ everything that was
[17:45] lost in the dark ages
[17:47] there has been a progression of
[17:49] revelation starting at martin luther
[17:52] with uh with the message of
[17:54] justification
[17:55] moving into uh the leadership of john
[17:59] wesley with the message of
[18:00] sanctification
[18:02] developing further into the pentecostal
[18:06] time period the pentecostal age where
[18:09] the gifts of the spirit were restored
[18:11] the baptism of the holy ghost and even
[18:13] glossolalia
[18:15] the the the manifestation of speaking in
[18:18] another tongue
[18:19] god has restored his word for the bride
[18:23] from the dark ages
[18:25] and so the bride is hearing the word and
[18:28] is growing in the in the revelation of
[18:30] jesus christ all over the world that
[18:33] deep calling to the deep that we often
[18:36] mention on this broadcast but the church
[18:39] world the denominational world the
[18:41] religious world in so many cases seems
[18:44] to continue to to uh
[18:47] slip down that slope
[18:49] uh into apostasy
[18:52] uh
[18:53] we've compromised with sin the old
[18:54] old-timers in the old pentecostal church
[18:57] used to say we've compromised with sin
[19:00] we've let down the bars we've
[19:02] compromised with sin the
[19:05] sheep got out and the goats got in
[19:07] and really that's where we are the world
[19:10] is getting churchy and the church has
[19:12] gotten worldly there's been a whole
[19:14] reversal of roles
[19:16] and uh so
[19:18] it's very very sad it's it's a sad
[19:21] condition but it was a necessary
[19:24] condition in some regard because it will
[19:26] take that uh that uh preaching of
[19:29] tolerance that ecumenical mindset
[19:32] it will take that kind of an ideology to
[19:35] plunge the world into a one world
[19:38] religion
[19:39] which again will be headquartered in the
[19:43] city that sits on seven hills according
[19:46] to the scripture and i don't believe
[19:48] it's referring to denver colorado by the
[19:50] way
[19:51] i believe the scripture's clear when it
[19:53] talks about this system this is not
[19:56] people but it's the system the system
[19:59] that is drunk
[20:00] this whoreish system mentioned in the
[20:03] book of revelation that's drunk on the
[20:06] blood of the martyrs
[20:07] 68 plus million people killed by the
[20:11] church system that church system
[20:14] continues to develop
[20:16] a mystery babylon continues to march on
[20:19] until the world is swung into a
[20:21] one-world religion and the antichrist
[20:25] that
[20:26] that charismatic
[20:28] you know perhaps good-looking guy will
[20:30] step on the scene
[20:32] to lead the world into peace quote
[20:35] unquote but uh the bride will never be
[20:38] deceived by that kind of stuff our eyes
[20:41] are on jesus we're not looking for
[20:43] another messiah we're not looking for
[20:45] another savior we are only looking for
[20:48] the return of the one who saved us in
[20:51] the beginning the one true and only
[20:53] messiah the lord jesus christ so no
[20:56] matter what the church does no matter
[20:59] how she compromises no matter how
[21:01] eventually a one world religion is
[21:03] formed god's going to have what he has
[21:06] always had in every age a true
[21:10] remnant a bride that will stay true to
[21:13] the word even if it costs her her life
[21:17] and that's how serious this thing is
[21:19] going to eventually get in the time of
[21:21] the great wrath
[21:23] there's a lot of studying that we can do
[21:26] in revelation chapter 13
[21:29] verse 17 in revelation chapter 17
[21:33] it talks about a lot of this antichrist
[21:36] one world religion mystery babylon
[21:40] uh stuff that we can talk about at in
[21:43] another broadcast but i wanted to
[21:45] mention that as the third category of
[21:49] the birth pains of messiah we see this
[21:51] advancing along in the name of unity in
[21:54] the name of tolerance but it's really a
[21:56] plot of the enemy
[21:58] uh again that god is fully aware of to
[22:01] take the world into a one church system
[22:05] number two uh goes hand in hand with
[22:09] number three number two is the formation
[22:12] of a one world government and a one
[22:15] world economy
[22:17] uh we're counting backwards because
[22:19] we're building up in intensity
[22:21] and and i think this number two
[22:24] uh
[22:25] for the birth pains of the messiah we're
[22:28] going to see some
[22:30] uh
[22:31] tremendous things
[22:33] i say tremendous not because they're
[22:35] going to be wonderful but they're going
[22:37] to be hard to believe
[22:39] we're going to see some hard to believe
[22:41] things
[22:42] unfold in the next few months and and
[22:45] few short years
[22:47] that will
[22:49] tremendous strides will be made will be
[22:52] accomplished in taking the world into a
[22:56] one world government eventually that one
[22:59] world church union and that one world
[23:02] government union will join they will
[23:04] come together
[23:06] uh for that for that real impact of the
[23:09] antichrist on the earth
[23:12] this is a very serious thing to look at
[23:15] we have organizations in place
[23:17] federations of nations in place right
[23:20] now that are preparing the way
[23:23] um i don't say that they're the the
[23:25] final chapter but
[23:27] or or the final version of what will be
[23:31] but they're preparing the way
[23:33] for a time that nations will come
[23:35] together
[23:36] uh one one government will rule the
[23:38] world and one economy one economic
[23:42] system one monetary system uh to control
[23:45] the world somebody says this just sounds
[23:48] outlandish well if you look back over
[23:50] the past 10 years things have happened
[23:52] in our world that we never dreamed could
[23:54] happen unless we were looking at the
[23:57] scripture
[23:58] and today we're looking at the
[24:00] scriptures and we see
[24:02] that that it is possible it is happening
[24:05] and we can expect again
[24:08] the growth of
[24:11] frequency
[24:12] and
[24:13] intensity in the strides that are going
[24:16] to be made to bring the world into a one
[24:19] world society or as some have called it
[24:22] a new world order
[24:26] some of the things they hope to
[24:27] accomplish sound amazing sound wonderful
[24:31] but i'm telling you it's just another
[24:34] step in in in selling out to the
[24:36] antichrist
[24:38] so we want to remain true to the word of
[24:40] god we want to
[24:42] see our relationship with the messiah
[24:45] grow deeper in in intensity we want to
[24:49] just give more of ourselves to him and
[24:51] be more yielded so that we can be used
[24:54] in the end time uh i do not believe that
[24:57] the that the bride of jesus christ which
[24:59] is made up of both jew and gentile being
[25:02] prepared in this hour i do not believe
[25:05] that that we will see the great wrath
[25:08] but i believe we will see tribulation in
[25:10] fact many are seeing tribulation right
[25:12] now so to say that we're going to be
[25:15] caught out of fear before any hardship
[25:17] falls on the earth well we're too late
[25:19] for that already uh because there's a
[25:21] lot of hardship the united states of
[25:24] america is not immune to the things that
[25:27] are going to be transpiring on the
[25:29] planet so there's not going to be a
[25:31] geographical safety zone but there is
[25:34] going to be a spiritual safety zone and
[25:36] again that's in a loving relationship
[25:39] with the lord jesus christ we've got the
[25:41] eu we've got the u.n we've got many many
[25:45] many other units coming together
[25:48] and they seem to be doing such an
[25:50] amazing job
[25:53] some seem to think so anyway some
[25:56] evaluate it to be such an amazing job
[25:59] but again really it is
[26:02] nothing but prophecy coming to pass to
[26:05] let us know that we are nearing the
[26:08] coming of the lord perhaps you need the
[26:11] lord to encourage you in this hour so
[26:13] that you are not
[26:15] paralyzed by fear i want to pray today
[26:18] the bible said that perfect love casteth
[26:20] out fear god does not want you paralyzed
[26:24] by fear he wants you trusting in his
[26:27] word the same scriptures
[26:29] the same scripture that tells us about
[26:32] the things
[26:33] tragic events that are going to befall
[26:36] the earth the same scripture tells us
[26:39] that there is a safety place in trusting
[26:42] the king of kings and the lord of lords
[26:44] i want to pray that god will help you in
[26:46] this hour to trust him more father thank
[26:49] you for this opportunity to speak a few
[26:52] words of truth
[26:53] to drop out some nuggets hopefully that
[26:56] will cause folk to dig a little deeper
[26:58] in the word and i'm asking right now
[27:01] that you will speak to people's lives
[27:04] draw them into a closer relationship
[27:06] with you we we can't just make up our
[27:08] mind to draw close to you it has to be
[27:11] that you're drawing us
[27:13] and then we respond to that draw so lord
[27:16] i'm asking you to draw your people those
[27:20] who who i have an opportunity to
[27:22] minister to and and those who this
