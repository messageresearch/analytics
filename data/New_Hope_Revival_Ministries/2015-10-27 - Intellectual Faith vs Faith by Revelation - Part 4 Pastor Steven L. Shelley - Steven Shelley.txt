TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] oh well praise the Lord you're watching the Eagles cry and I'm Pastor step Shelly I want to welcome you to the broadcast today we are studying the difference between intellectual faith and Faith by Revelation I want you to understand in this study that we are not against an intellectual or a mental concept of Faith because that's where it starts all of our faith starts with something we read something we hear and we just say I believe that we attach ourselves to that I believe that and I that is where we began many of you began that way in your journey because some of you were brought up in homes that were not Christian homes homes where other gods were worshiped and exonerated and yet somehow you read the gospel someone handed you a pamphlet or a track a book you saw Christian television like this great Network that you're watching right now somebody told you witnessed to you about the truth of the Lord Jesus Christ and you said H that's right I believe that and that is the beginning of our faith so don't you think that I am saying that that mental concept of faith is is bad or wrong what I'm saying is it's not enough it's a good place to start I believe but let me tell you something when when your think so becomes a no so that can only happen by the power of the Holy Spirit the last time we were together we were reading about Peter I mean actually the last couple of times we were together we've been talking about Peter and we were reading the last time we were together in Acts chapter 2 even after Peter denied his relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ went out and wept bitterly he never denied who Jesus was only who he was to him or who he was to the Lord Jesus that relationship between the two he denied that but he was there at shavo o in Acts chapter 2 on the day of Pentecost and in verse four was filled with the Holy Ghost and then we started reading the verses where he stood up and I want you to know there was no Denial in him there was no shame in him that day he wasn't weeping bitterly with shame or denying that he knew the Lord on that day he was declaring with boldness this is Jesus this is the one that the scriptures have promised and Believe on him and you shall be saved repent acts 238 and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost what gave Peter this transition this boldness this courage from being a denier to a testifier to a bold deliverer of the truth well it was the Holy Ghost that's what made the difference and that's what we need in our life we start with intellectual Faith but we need the spirit of God to Quicken it to make that belief Al alive to make it alive in us burning with with fire with passion when truth sets on fire you know it changes things it really does Jeremiah had this experience it's like fire shut up in my bones and in the old days uh of of the Pentecostal church I grew up in the old-timers would stand up and say I know that I know that I know that I know what did they mean they meant this is not just a casual belief system for me I am all in I know this is the truth and I'm willing to live by it and if necessary I'm willing to die by it now that can only come by Revelation not just the mental concept we also talked about the scripture in the Book of James chap 2: 19 that even the Devils even demons believe and tremble they know there's one God but that's just an intellectual kind of belief it's not enough that causes them to go on and do what acts 16331 said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved in thy house so they they believe but not with the kind of faith is going to be necessary to stand the test of time quickly today I want to take you through a little study in the Book of John and show you how many people believed on the Lord Jesus Christ during his Earthly Ministry sometimes the church has slightly twisted the circumstances and made us believe that most Jewish people and the religious people of that day rejected the Lord now it's true that their eyes were veiled were blinded that they couldn't see the fullness that many would not see the fullness of who he was because God had a perfect plan he was to be crucified for the Salvation of not just the Jewish people but also of the Gentile Nations and in order to do so there had to be a partial blinding of their eyes but many were not blinded in the sense that the scripture said they believed and let's look at that quickly to kind of help give us a further understanding of what it means to believe uh and believe because there must be a little difference in there one must be intellectual believing and one must be Faith by Revelation look at John 223 now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover in the feast day many believed in his name when they saw the Miracles which he did they saw the Miracles and they did what they believed that was John 2 John 7331 then they sought to take him but no man laid hands on him because this hour his hour was not yet come and many of the people believed on him and said when Christ cometh will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done many believed so we've got many believed and then now many many believed John 8331 and he spake these words many believed on him then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed now the scripture said many of the Jews who heard Jesus speaking in John 8 believed on him but the key Jesus told them right here you need more than just to believe you've got to continue in my word you've got to have a deeper understanding of my word and that only comes by the Holy Spirit but now we've already got three verses in the Book of John many believed many many believed many many many believed John 10:41 and many resorted unto him and said John did no Miracle but all things that John spake of this man were true and many believed on him there look at how many minis we have and John 11 another one for verse 45 then many of the Jews which came to Mary and had seen the things which Jesus did believed on him so here's another many another multitude of people John 12 the next chapter and this talks about Lazarus much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there and they came not for jesus' sake only but that they might see Lazarus also whom he had raised from the dead there's nothing like a living witness but the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death here's some priests that wanted to kill Lazarus because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away and believed on Jesus many of them left and believed on Jesus on the next day much people that were come to the feast when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem took branches of palm trees and went forth to meet him and cried hosana blessed is the king of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord multitudes many people John 12: 42 further down nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him lest they should be put out of the synagogue for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God see they had a belief system but it was not as strong as their desire to protect their own reputation now it was one believe right after another many believe many many believe many many it goes on and on and on so I don't want you to have this concept that only a handful of people believed many many believed that Jesus was the Messiah the problem is only as a mental concept it was not a revelation to them it had not been made real to them by the Holy Spirit and when these many people when these multi mudes of people saw him dying on the cross the most shameful and cursed death of all the very Foundation of their mental Faith was shaken and for most it totally eroded away when they saw his swollen lips and head blood either dried and crusted on his body and from a few places still oozing he's hanging there naked stripped of his garments when all of these things were going on on in Jerusalem the denial the Betrayal Faith being shaken questions being formed and uncertainty everywhere all of this going on but remember his resurrection was just a few days away things were about to change he was about to make himself a living reality and so when you look at Luke let's do that really quick I didn't know that I was going to go there but let's go really quick to Luke I want us to look at chapter 23 that's one of the gospels of course we were just reading in John let's go to the book before that and let's see what was happening now at the end of his life all the way through that's chapter 23 beginning in verse 18 now this is the same many many many the same multitude of of people the same crowd that believed and now we have come down to the end and pilate has called together the chief priests and the rulers of the people and said to them you brought this man to me as one that perverteth the people and behold I having examined him before you verse 14 have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him no nor yet Herod for I sent you to him and lo nothing worthy of death is done unto him I will therefore chastise him and release him for of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast and they cried out all the once saying away with this man and release unto us barabus where were the many many many many where was the multitude where were all of those people who believed D and now they answered away with this man verse 19 who for a certain sedition made in the city and for murderer was cast into prison this is talking about barabus Pilate therefore willing to release Jesus spake again to them but they cried saying crucify him crucify him and he even said unto them the third time why what evil hath he done I have found no cause for death in him I will therefore chastise him and let him go and they were instant with loud voices requiring that he might be crucified and the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed and pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required and he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison whom they had desired but he delivered Jesus to their will to be crucified see how fickle the crowds can be all a minute ago all through the book of John many believed many believe many believe many believe but when it came down to this very important test they responded crucify him because they weren't willing to pay the price of being identified with him in the end they didn't have a holy ghost revelation of who Jesus is was how important he was how he came to be a savior to be a deliverer and that's because many had moved around the crowd that day influencing people to choose barabus to as a substitute as another savior give us barabus we want him and many are making for themselves another Jesus choosing another route one who is more pleasing to the masses one who is not involved in their everyday life one who does not care how one lives their life how one behaves how one dresses in public some call this other Christ a more simpler Jesus they are reshaping and remolding him into a mental concept of what they desire him to be please don't change who Jesus is to suit your compromised life please don't change what the scripture teaches about unbelief and sin so that it fits more appropriately the life that you have chosen to live let God's word stand alone he is not changing himself to fit us we have to make changes in our life so that we can be joined to him in real intimate relationship and many of these things we learn in maturity as we press in as we make mistakes as we fail along the way and we pick ourselves up or he comes by the Holy Spirit and picks us up and we learn and we say I don't want to do that listen this salvation is not is it doesn't come to us in some automatic manner it was paid for with a precious precious Price look at Ephesians 2:8 with me for a moment for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of ourselves it is the gift of God do you know even the faith that we use to truly believe in him to the place of Salvation is a gift he gave us the ability to believe many believe multitudes believe but not all the way to Salvation it is a gift of God it is by Grace it is through the holy spirit that you can really believe you know some people want to hold on to the option that Jesus may be real while praying to their other gods while following in their old traditions of of pagan and false religion but they're keeping the possibility that Jesus May really be a savior I want you to know that's only mental concept you have if you feel that way you're going to hold on in case there's something to this that's not going to be enough if persecution should ever come your way if you're ever on trial for your faith if you're ever in a place where you would have to deny you'll never have the strength to stand for Jesus unless you've received a revelation of who he really is that comes by the Holy Spirit and I I just encourage you you know to to call out to God for that it's very very important that we just ask the Lord to take our mental Faith what we what we think what we believe and take that to another level drive it down you know a friend of ours talks about when when truth moves from your head to your heart and then it doesn't stop there it goes out into our hands and feet what does that mean it means that when truth starts off as a thought in your mind then the Holy Spirit drives it down into your inner being into your spirit it becomes a revelation and what becomes a revelation becomes a lifestyle it becomes a part of your demonstration of faith and you you're not just telling people I believe you're showing people that you believe because the truth has or a truth has become to you the truth and you're you are uh walking in a revelation by the spirit of God it's it's you know I I often quote the scripture if that same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwell in you it shall also Quicken your mortal body and that's where we are we're in that place where we've got to have that quickening I I want to share with you a few a few things that have really blessed me down through the years I I mean I have really been blessed to understand uh what faith is and I'm going to be quoting from one of the great Giants of the faith and I I've mentioned uh William brandham Brother Branham I've mentioned him on this broadcast before a great man of God one who was used as a prophet of God uh one generation ago and I find so much strength and inspiration in his words even today and he's preaching about faith and he said what is faith faith is something that's revealed to you but it it is not yet but you believe it will be faith is a revel ation of the will of God that's the kind of Faith we're we're we're after the the scriptural Faith the the scriptural definition of faith in Hebrews is that faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of Things Not Seen and that's what brother Brandon was telling the people there in this message he said it is a revelation of things that are not yet but you believe them anyway and then another thing uh from Brother brandom that's been a real blessing to me uh if any of you have heard his life story or read his life story you'll know that in his early days he lost his his first wife to death and his beautiful baby girl Sharon Rose there was a terrible flood in the Ohio river in the city where brother brandham lived near Jeffersonville Indiana and the flood did so much damage and uh lost lot of people died in the flood and lots of people died after the flood by the disease and uh pneumonia and so many other things that happened because of the living conditions that the people were left with in the flood and brother brandom tells this he's very transparent in one of his sermons and he talks about a day that he was standing by the grave of his wife and little Sharon Rose who was buried there with her mother and he's brokenhearted and he he's thinking about the years that he has given to God and the work that he's done for God and yet here lay his wife and beautiful uh baby girl and he's left with a a little baby boy to take care of on his own he's just heartbroken and he's standing there in silence and a man uh stops his car he sees brother brandom standing out in the cemetery and he stops his car and he pulls over and he comes there to where brother brandom is standing and he said Billy I sure feel sorry for you you've been through so much and brother brandom responds well that's all right uh uh you know I appreciate you saying so and he saw that I was weeping and he said I want to ask you something and of course he said go ahead and ask me he said I've seen you stand there in that pool pit giving out working so hard I thought you'd die I've seen you fast and you'd be so pey uh weak I would feel sorry for you in and out day and night constantly serving and now your wife and baby taken from you there what does Christ mean to you now you know that's a awful hard question to ask somebody in that moment what does Christ mean to you now and brother brandom answered thou the stream of all my comfort more than life to me whom have I on Earth beside thee are whom in heaven but thee he quoted the words to that great hymn he said I found the absolute that's something that held me when the storm was on and here's what I wanted to get to I like this very much this man said to him Billy did you keep your religion during that time of trouble you know people ask you sometime when they know you're going through something uh did you hold on to your religion and you know what he said he said no I didn't it kept me I didn't keep my religion My Religion kept me I think we could replace that word religion there because some people have put such a negative uh uh meaning to it by faith no I didn't just keep my faith but my faith kept me I want to ask you what kind of faith is that is that the belief like the Devils believed in tremble is that the belief like the multitudes many believe many believe many believe or is this Faith something stronger something a little deeper something a little more absolute than that I believe it is I believe the faith that brother Brandon was demonstrating in this place where he could stand by that grave losing the most precious thing to him in all the Earth and yet say you're you're the stream of all my comfort more than life to me who do I have on Earth I tell you what a great testimony and to be able to say that in a time like that when you're going through the darkest trial of your life I'm going to hold on to God and he's going to hold on to me it takes more than that mental uh concept of Faith doesn't it it takes Holy Spirit inspired revealed Faith because there are times in our life and here's what I wanted to get to before I leave you today there are times in our life when we are facing those dark dark storms and it seems that God is silent maybe you've never encountered that but I have you know God has spoken to me the Holy Spirit has dealt with me all my life since I was just a small child I had a my first spiritual encounter with the Lord when I was only 18 months old one year and a half and he met me in such a wonderful and profound way and then when I was three years old the Lord came to me in a visitation and called me and told me what my life would be and how I would serve him and of course uh uh then I've served him all my life when I was seven years old he baptized me with the Holy Ghost now I've had some hard times in life my parents divorced when I was 5 years old my mother remarried and the man that she remarried beat her time and time and time again I grew up uh in the middle of the night to the sounds of my mother's screams where she was being beating beaten I feared for her life I did what only a little boy could do to try to stop it and these are things that I saw day after day after day so my life wasn't always easy I've not suffered like many of you folk have suffered but I had some difficult times and the Lord kept me in every one of those times but there have been moments in my my life when I needed God to speak to me and he was silent I couldn't hear from God I'd pray till I run out of words have you ever been there run out of words I didn't know anything else to say and I would listen to hear God's voice to feel him I would open up my Bible and expect him to show me something in his word and it looked like dead words on a dead page nothing I could feel no connection if you've ever been there you know like I do when God seems to be silent the devil has plenty to say Oh my he will lie he will accuse he will tell you there's no reason to hold on and that just really almost finishes you up and you have to reach way down inside of you to find some Revelation something that God has made real to you and you pull that up and that's what you use to start swinging at the enemy and so you keep holding on until you can hear God's voice again if you're going through a time like that the devil's talking all the time and God doesn't seem to be speaking reach down and find something in you that God has made real to you hold on to the Rock of Ages hold on to the lifeline let your anchor grip the solid rock don't you dare be moved in this hour I pray right now in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ that your faith will be anointed that the holy spirit will pour down on your mental concept of belief and change it into a revelation that will stand the storms of life I pray your anchor will hit the solid rock and that you will rise up with courage and strength to believe God and to tell others that Jesus is your lord your master your savior father heal the sick according to the promise of your word in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen I feel a good presence of God thank you for watching the Eagles cry tune in again next time bye-bye for [Music] [Applause] [Music] now [Music]
