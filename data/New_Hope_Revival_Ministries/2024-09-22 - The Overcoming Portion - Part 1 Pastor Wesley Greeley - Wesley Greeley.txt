thanking the lord for his visitation to us today we're happy to have you in the house of the Lord to all of the Home Folks to all of the visitors we're just so thankful that you could be here with us today to all of you that are watching this service over the stream may the Lord bless you and give you all the desires of your heart I would like to read from the scripture today in Revelation chap 1 starting in verse 10 Revelation 1 verse 10 I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou seest write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia unto Ephesus unto Smyrna unto pergamus unto thyra unto Sardis and unto Philadelphia and unto leoda and I turned to see the voice that spoke with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and GT about the pths with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like undefined brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more amen and have the keys of hell and of death write the things which thou thou Hast seen and the things which are and the things which shall be Hereafter The Mystery of the Seven Stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the golden candlesticks the Seven Stars are the Angels of the seven churches and the Seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches let us pray before we are seated today our father we are certainly grateful M uh merciful god we are grateful that you allow us to come together with fellow Believers into the presence of the Lord in this Sanctuary Lord this building that you gave to us we're thankful Lord that we could be gathered here in the presence of the Lord we thank you that you are working both to will and do of your good pleasure as we approach your word today I pray that you would hide the vessel and that you will speak Lord as I open my mouth I ask you to fill it and let it be filled with Words of Life hope exhortation strength God I am asking that you will just speak your word as you see fit to us today you see the needs of your people that are here those out across the stream those that might watch an archive of a service you know the need Lord and you know best how to meet the need we ask you to do that we ask you that you will minister to our pastor while he is away on holiday that you will will restore strength Lord the purposes that you have uh foreordained in his life may they come very very clear once again that he would know his next step I pray that you will just lighten his load and give him the grace that he needs in this hour now we ask you once again that you'll settle down over us as a cloak let let that anointing settle down over us now we ask this in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ for his glory amen may the Lord bless you as you're seated today as we pray and Ponder what we should present to the body we want to be in the season of the Lord every time we want to know that we're in his season we're in his plan in the purpose for today not yesterday and not tomorrow we want to be in his plan and purpose for today we want to walk hand in hand with him to know that we're carrying out his plan for our lives and that we're not getting under somebody else's burden to carry their burden and not carry our own that the Lord has placed upon us obviously we want to help to carry one another's burdens that's not what I'm saying but we don't want to carry someone else's burden illegally we don't want to carry their burden for longer than we ought to be helping them to carry it we need to be focused on what the Lord is saying today and so as I pondered what should be for today I begin to think about the what we as a body have heard time and time again concerning uh the the church ages and we have heard it said over and over and over again that in the last age that there would be a culmination of all of the spirits of evil that had been in all of the other Church ages there would be a culmination of the evil and that we as as people in the end time we would have to face those things uh and and they there are many and we know that the lid of hell has been ripped off and the spirits of Darkness that have been down Through the Ages they're just looking for something or someone uh specifically they're looking for someone to inhabit they the the spirits do not like to be disembodied they are looking for a body body to dwell in we can go to the scripture and see that when those Spirits were CA cast out of the demoniac uh who was in the graveyard they wanted somewhere to go and when Jesus cast them out they asked if they could go into the swine we know that they were granted permission and they went into the swine and immediately the swine jumped off the cliff and they all drowned so where did the spirit go after that they were still looking for a body to dwell in they were still looking for someone to inhabit they wanted somewhere to go and so we know that with all of these Spirits floating around those things that we cannot see but yet they try to infiltrate our mind and and on a daily basis thoughts split across our mind that they're not ours yet if we're in a vulnerable place we may entertain [Applause] them we may momentarily give them a place to Lodge and and they talk to us for a little while and we talk back to them and and then in some instances we find ourselves immediately saying that's not mine get out of here there are other times it may last for some minutes and there are other times where we entertain it for days weeks months and perhaps even years but a child of God has got to recognize that there are some things that fly through our mind but they're not ours and we immediately need to take control of them and say not today sainton it's not mine I don't I'm not going to have this and we you know we could keep the victory a whole lot better if we learn to talk back to the [Applause] devil we have been told in the scripture over and over and over again fear not but I think we're intimidated or afraid sometimes to talk back to the devil when he tries to come with a thought or an idea or something of that dark world to put in our mind and cause us to entertain it and to live it out but that's not the call of a holy ghost child of God our call is to get rid of everything that is unlike Jesus Christ and we can't just say Lord take this out of me and remain as an empty vessel we must be filled and refilled and refilled with the holy ghost power over and over again because we don't want any voids in our life because the devil is as a as a roaring lion he is looking for someone to inhabit he's looking for someone to take control of and all he needs is one little door to get into and we need to close off all of those doors and continually as Believers saying Lord refill me refill me any place in me when when we repent and we ask the Lord to move something out of us we immediately want to ask the Lord Fill Me Lord with your holy spirit let your life come in and inhabit that spot in me because I don't want any place in there where the enemy can have free reign in my life but as I am thinking about the these these Church ages and all of the all of the spirits the dark Spirits the evil of every age culminating into this age I begin to ask myself what am I needing to combat all of these things there we know because most of us have studied these things out we've studied the church ages we've gone through them in this church uh several times over the years and we've referred to them over the years concerning the Overcomers and and the over there are Overcomers of every age every age had Overcomers they came over they were able to scale the mountain all of you know it it kind of reminds me of of of uh this mountain of garbage over here on 158 and 183 Waste Management it it's uh people's garbage that has become a mountain it's become very large and that's what all of the evil spirits all of this all all of the things that you and I combat they're like a mountain of garbage that we've got to over go over and we're we're we don't want any of the smell we don't want any of that stuff on us we God has sent an a an anointing in the end time that we could have a flying eagle anointing that we could fly above all of it that you know we we've got all these analogies concerning climbing the mountain and we're actually climbing Mount Zion not a mountain of garbage all right we're climbing Mount Zion and God is giving us the grace to climb Mount Zion but there is a pile of garbage in this world that we have to overcome and we want the Flying Eagle anointing to get over it and so you start pondering Lord how am I going to overcome and so I started breaking down each of these Church ages and I I broke them down into categories and today I want to just I think probably time only for one of these categories and that is the most important part of every one of these categories and that is the one who is going to live in us to give us the power to overcome so when you look at chapter two of of the book of the Revelation and it starts starts out with the Ephesian Church age or the Church of Ephesus uh every age starts out with these things saith he so we're going to talk for some time today about him and we're going to look at each age because each age had their own thing to overcome we know that all of the demonic spirits have age have culminated now into this one and so if every one of the evil spirits have come into this age that because they're just multiplying they're multiplying as the ages go by they're multiplying yet we have been given the power in the end time to overcome we're not going to be be left helpless as humans we feel helpless sometimes we feel like you describe your feeling may be different than my feeling yet God has given us the ability to overcome in the end time and the only way that we're going to do it is because that he is living in us and we want to see all the representations of of of him of what he is giving us in the end time to combat all of these Spirits so when we look at Ephesus we are seeing that these things saith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in his right hand and walks in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks so he's holding these Messengers and there's some things that I'm not going to be able to fully talk about today but the Seven Stars as we read in the previous chapter the Seven Stars are the Angels or The Messengers of the seven churches that were in Asia Minor now remember the mouthpiece may be gone but the angel is still here so he that has the Seven Stars in his right hand and he walks in the midst of the seven gold golden candlesticks which again the previous chapter tells us that the seven golden candlesticks are the seven churches and so we have we have an understanding that God is still he's holding all of these Messengers in his hand he's allowing their message to get out to us the message that they had their message is still getting out to us and we the church he the living God is still walking among us we are not left helpless he is still walking Among Us he's still walking among those seven golden candlesticks he didn't quit at six he continued to walk on the seventh one now might I add that there is a church within a church we are blessed to know that there is a church within a church and that to clarify that we have been C we're in the middle of leoda we see it all around us we see the spirit of the age it's all around us yet there is a part of an overcoming portion that has been given to us so that we can step out of the influence of the church age into a bridal par Paradigm now if that's the case in the seventh Church age it was also the case in every Church age because there is a bridal company from every Church age who I mean the scripture tells us that there were Overcomers to him that overcomes so there was a a there was a church within a church there were Overcomers there were those that just kind of floated along they were just kind of part of society they acted and looked just like the rest of the church world but there was a group that said I cannot be partakers of what my church age is doing I have to step into a higher calling so he's not only holding the messenger of each age he is also Holding On To You John chapter 10 veres 27-30 my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my uh my Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of the father's my father's hand I and my father are one you can't be plucked out of his hand you ever had anybody to snatch something out of your hand know if my mind immediately goes to some kind of ball playing football or basketball or something of that nature somebody tries to grab it out of your hand knock it out of your hand but you can't be knocked out of Papa's hand there is such a strong grip on you that you cannot be plucked out of his hand if you belong to him you cannot be plucked out of his hand that's just who he is that's our Focus today be we're we're looking at who he is to help us in this overcoming process and we're trying to see all uh in the this church age analogies we're trying to look at who he is on our behalf and how we can enter into what he has done on our behalf what he is doing we want to take part in that all right so then we look at the second age and that is Mna and the scripture says that he is the first and the last he which was dead and is alive all right so the first and the last he is the one who was before any of us he started it he's the same one that's going to finish it right he that has begun the good work in you is able to complete it bring it all the way to its finish he's able to do that for you there are times when we fall down and his grace reaches down to us and picks us back up his grace picks us back up because he started it and he's going to finish it the the scripture said he was the one that was dead and is now alive in these scriptures we're trying to get an idea a picture of the one who is giving us the strength to not just make it we're not going to barely make it we are overcome comers right we are thrivers we will overcome in the end time we're going to overcome the spirit of this age and every other age that is culminated in this one we're going to overcome and the way that we're going to overcome is because the first and the last lives in US amen the one who died and gave his life that we could have life the one who shed his blood as brother Hawke preached here on Tuesday night the the the the beauty of what was done at Calvary and he didn't just stay in a tomb that's what the scripture is trying to tell us he did not just die and that was the end of it but he died and is alive it doesn't even say and was alive because Lazarus died and was alive but he died again but this one that we serve he was dead and he is alive he's alive today and he dwells inside of us Isaiah 41:4 who hath wrought and done it calling the generations from the beginning I the Lord the First with the last I am he Isaiah 44:6 thus saith the Lord the king of Israel and his Redeemer the Lord of host I am the first and I am the last and besides me there is no God the one in the beginning the creator of Heaven and Earth the creator of sun moon and stars the creator of all the seeds the creator of all the beasts that one he was the first and he is also the last Isaiah 48:12 hearken unto me oh Jacob and Israel my called I am he I am the first and also am the last now here's where it goes from God above us to now go God With Us 1 Corinthians 15:45 and so it is written the first man Adam was made a living Soul the last Adam was made a quickening spirit the first and the last the first God Almighty don't let's not get confused but I wanted to draw attention here to the last Adam was made a quickening spirit it is the same Spirit if this spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dead dwell in you it will also Quicken your mortal bodies it's definitely going to Quick our new Quicken our new body but it says it's going to Quicken our mortal body the one we're living in right now The Same Spirit if the same spirit that dwelt in Jesus dwells in you if will also Quicken your mortal body it will do something inside of you it will do something outside of you it will do something all over you and when you get under that quickening Spirit you know we're we're recognizing that we've talked some about what the feelings have to do with it and we're not basing our walk with the Lord on how we feel right this second or what it feels like on Monday morning but we do know that there is a feeling that comes with that quickening power there is something I mean he did not give us that scripture if the spirit that dwells in you uh if the same spirit that raised him from the dead dwells in you it'll Quicken your mortal bodies he must have known that there were some Mondays that we needed a quickening there were some Sundays that we needed a quickening there were some Fridays that we needed a quickening there was some times that we needed uh a feeling there were some times that we needed a Feeling you husbands ever tell your wives I just need a hug you wives tell your husbands I just need a hug your children come to you I just need a hug now imagine imagine what it would be like if whoever said I need a hug couldn't feel it when he comes with his presence my Mor mortal body responds to it when he comes with his hug my mortal body responds to it there is a feeling to it he is the first and the last he is the one who was dead and is now alive and because that he was dead and is now alive he wants that same spirit that raised him up from the dead he wants it to dwell inside of you to raise up and Quicken your mortal body not just after you're dead and you need to be raised up out of the ground no he wants it to be why you're in this Mortal body you're living in this realm and his presence comes to you he wants you to recognize that he is alive and that he wants to dwell in you and he wants you to feel it do I live my life on feelings if I did I'd have quit already if you did you'd have quit already so we keep coming back to the well we keep coming back to his presence he is alive uh Revelation chap 1 ver 17 to 19 we already read when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand on me and said fear not I am the first and the last I am he that live liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more amen and have the keys of hell and of death so we have the first and the last we have the one who holds the seven uh angels in his hand and walks among the seven churches we have the one who was dead and is alive he is he is who we are looking at today he is the one who is abiding in us to give us the grace and the courage and the strength to be able to go through this world where that we're dealing with all of this evil then in pergamus it it gives his desri description as he which hath the sharp sword with two edges he hath the sharp sword with two edges now I chose to read from Hebrews 4:12 which we have heard many times from this pulpit in the Amplified version for the word that God speaks is alive and full of power making it active operative energizing and effective active operative energizing and effective it is sharper than any two-edged sword penetrating to the dividing line of the Breath of Life the soul and the immortal spirit and of the joints and Marrow of the deepest parts of our nature exposing and sifting and analyzing and judging the very thoughts and purposes of the heart now let's just stop and think about this sword we know that the word of God is referred to as the sword we know that it is alive and it is full of power but it's not just a written book because for some this is just words on a page and most of us that are sitting here today have had at least one period in our life where it was just words on a page it was not a alive and full of power it was not active it was not operative it was not energizing and it was not effective we were existing but because the god of Grace who loves us and knows us and will not leave us in that shape he comes along as the god with the sharp two-edged sword in his mouth and if we were in that kind of a shape and we belong to him there is somewhere some way somehow whether it be across a pull pit whether it be a song whether it be uh listening to the radio hearing a preacher or a recorded sermon or something that would all of the sudden that that sharp two-edged sword would penetrate to the dividing line of the soul and the spirit to where that our emotions or emotionless could be cut out of the way and that sword could go all the way into our spirit man and the word of God could get to the seed that has been there all along and it begins to become again active and operative and energizing and effective it's no longer dead but the sword the sword of the word that proceeds from his mouth when it speaks it is alive and full of power you may say Okay preacher I have set in a church and I heard the word and it did nothing for me could probably all say that at you know a spot in our life we're not talking necessarily about today a spot in our life where that right beside of us somebody was getting so happy they couldn't keep in their seat and we're sitting there thinking what was so good about that it almost seems Blasphemous to even say it but we're Humanity we realize that these things have happened in our life and by the grace of God that's not where we are today because somehow there was a spoken word at a due season that came to us and it energized us right up out of our seat out of our place of of of of just being crabby and grouchy and not being able to be kind to anyone and it pulled us up and out of that place where we are because it was the right word in the due season and it's that sharp two-edged sword that comes out of his mouth that is why you can't discount The Vessel if if you see my Humanity while the preaching of the word is going on I'm sorry I don't want you to I don't want you to see my Humanity all through the week but it comes out yes it does yet when a preacher gets under the anointing of the Holy Spirit you better retune your frequency because you're no longer listen to humanity you're listening to the sharp two-edged sword of the Lord that is being spoken and it is a word that you need to hear it is a word that can set you free it is a word that can help you to combat the evil that you are facing that's why we come to the house of the Lord to hear the word of the Lord because the sharp two-edged sword of the word Finds Its Mark the word will not return void word god but it will accomplish where to it is sent I will not return void but his word that is preached will not return void it will find its mark and it will strengthen and energize and become active in somebody's life because that's what the sharp two-edged sword does it is active and operative and energizing and effective sir effective it is effective in our lives when we have the right mental attitude toward the word of God is is it is effective in our life if we do not have the right mental attitude toward the word of God it will not be effective in a if we're just like ham he said it would work but I don't know if it's going to or not it he said that this is what would help me but I don't know I you know I've got so many things on my head right now I don't know if the word of God is effective but it takes our cooperation in agreeing with his word it takes our cooperation in knowing that the word of God is for us it is for our benefit it is to help us to overcome in the end time it is for us to be able to overcome the spirit of Darkness that surrounds us Psalm 149 veres 1-9 praise ye the Lord I got the wrong one Psalm 149 praise ye the Lord sing unto the Lord a new song and his praise in the congregation of Saints let Israel rejoice in him that made him let the children of Zion be joyful in their King let them praise His name in The Dance Let Them sing praises unto him with the timberl and harp for the lord taketh pleasure in his people he will beautify the meek with salvation let the Saints be joyful in glory let them sing aloud upon their beds let the high praises of God be in their mouth and a two-edged sword in their hand I thought it was supposed to be in our mouth well let me just maybe rephrase this a little bit this is a two-edged sword very obviously it's in my hand I just like to ask you something what good is this going to do me when I'm fighting a spiritual battle this natural sword in my hand I could hurt somebody with it might even hurt myself because I'm not an experienced sword wielder it's pretty heavy as a matter of fact and you know I could do physical damage but in a spiritual battle this natural weapon is not going to do me any good so let's look at this again let the high praises of God be in your mouth the high praises of God coming out of your mouth becomes the two-edged sword in your hand the Praises that come out of your mouth to the one who can do something about it becomes the two-edged sword because it becomes a word in your mouth that remember we've just read in in the Amplified Hebrews 4:12 that the word is active it's energizing it's effective it's working and we are participating with that word and giving praise to the one who gave us the word who is able to do something about it I can't do nothing with this to overcome the demons in my life it would be nice sometimes to be able to just hack somebody's head off you know I'm talking spirits because we don't fight flesh and blood in this spiritual warfare sometimes we think it would be easier if they would get right in front of us these spirits of darkness and we could take a physical sword and cut their head off we think it would be nice just to be ended with that one but that's not how spiritual warfare is done spiritual warfare is done by praising the one who gives us the grace to overcome these things and our praise out of our mouth becomes a sharp two-edged sword and it it the two-edged sword the high praises of God that is what executes judgment upon the Heathen and punishments upon the people in the older Covenant God gave commandment time and again to go eliminate a whole group of people I don't like what they're doing I don't like the way they act I don't like the idols they worship I want you to go and I want you to cut off the whole race we now live under a different Covenant we are under the Covenant of the Lord Jesus Christ and he is the one he he is the one who says vengeance is mine sayith the Lord I will repay and so if if he has given himself as the sharp twoed sword that is active and operative and energizing and effective then we want to be able to give him praise and and Lord Praises on him and thank him for all of his mighty acts and all of his mighty works because he is the one who has already defeated all of these things on our behalf and so we're coming into agreement with him by giving him the praise and the honor that he deserves so that he in turn takes care of these spirits we all wish that we knew better how to do spiritual warfare we wish that we knew sometimes what exactly we were fighting against that we could name it by name and tell it to go back where it came from and many times the Lord does not allow that for us so the best thing that we can do is we let the Saints be joyful in glory and let them sing aloud upon their beds because you know these demon Spirits like Darkness that's you know when you're laying in your bed and you wake up in the middle of the night and and all of a sudden this sense of fear comes over you and and for no apparent re reason a spirit of fear comes over you and you feel constricted and and that's what he's saying sing aloud let him sing aloud upon their beds let the high praises of God be in their mouth and a two-edged sword in their hand the high praises of God becomes The two-edged Sword and the demons have to scatter the fear has to leave because it is no longer the a fear that is in your mind but it is given praise to the one who the two-edged who is is the two-edged sword his M out of his mouth is the two-edged sword and our mouth is becoming his mouth and letting the Praises come out giving to him the glory that is due to his name it's going to execute judgment upon the Heathen it's going to bring punishments upon the people it's going to bind Kings with chains yes sir and their nobles with FEDS of iron to execute upon them the Judgment written this honor have all his Saints praise ye the Lord now if we as a people or as individuals could see the hierarchy of the spiritual Kingdom and they're not all underlings there are levels of the hierarchy in the Demonic Kingdom that they they they VI for attention they fight for position you may ask me how do you know that the first thing that I would tell you is that their father ended up kicked out of of Heaven for that very reason because he wasn't satisfied with his position and so he made a determination in his heart that he was going to get a bigger and a better and a more prominent position because he wanted to be the head honcho and so all of his underlings The Same Spirit abides on them and that's what they want to do and so when you find yourself trying to kick somebody else out of the way so that you can climb higher you need to question yourself have I let that kind of a spirit get on me right God forbid we don't want that but the reason I brought that up is because these last three verses uh to execute judgment on the Heathen punishments upon the people bind their kings with chains and their nobles with feathers of iron to execute upon them the Judgment written this honor have all his Saints now this was written in the time of David when they were really taking out physical people killing them we are in a spiritual battle where that again we can't take and hack their heads off with a sword that's how you end up in jail how you end up in prison that's not what we've been called to we've been called to a higher calling than that and by the sharp two-edged sword that comes out of our mouth by speaking the word in due season by praising him and giving him honor and glory for all of his wondrous works that he has done already and all of the ones that he will do and is doing it becomes the word out of our mouth that is active and energizing and effective it's the word that's going to do something and it's going to do something in that dark kingdom to bring down all those things that are against us that are trying to take us out well we're not moving very fast thyra the Son of God who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass the Son of God the one who condescended became flesh and the scripture tells us that his eyes now again I want us to remember why we're even looking at this study it's because he is the one who is giving us the strength he is the one who abides in us to be able to fight and combat all of this evil that we're fighting and each age had if you look at what I am giving to you from chapter 2 you can put it right back into chapter one right but each age what John saw in totality each age got in a measure so his eyes like a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass Daniel 106 puts it this way his body also was like the burl and his face as the appearance of lightning and his eyes as lamps of fire and his arms and his feet like in color to Polished brass and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude so I want you to take notice here that in Daniel 10 that it says eyes as lamps and both of those are plural plural words eyes and lamps but in Revelation 1114 and in Revelation 2:18 it gives eyes plural and a flame singular and that makes me think of Luke 11:34 the light of the body is the eye therefore when thine eye is single the whole body also is full of light but when thy eye is evil thy body also is full of darkness and so let's let's just f focus in here on this uh the eyes as a flame of fire now we have sung a song about that fire in his eyes is his love for his bride all right now he is looking at us brother Shelly has been talking to us over the last several weeks about the difference between envy and jealousy now our God is a jealous God and the reason that he is jealous is because we belong to him and because that I belong to him his eyes are singly on me they are they're not here flitting here and there and everywhere they're singly on me because he is jealous over me he is jealous over my destiny he is jealous that I make it all the way to the end he is jealous that I make it and overcome because I am his and he's not going to share me I'm his I belong to him and he's jealous for me because I'm his exclusively his we get sidetracked the enemy we give him room we get sidetracked and we allow the enemy you know we have these little trist with the devil but God is jealous because I'm his and this fire that is in his eyes is going to obliterate the enemy because I'm his and he's not going to share me with another I'm his you get it you're his and he's jealous for you and his eyes are like flames of fire and the body says that his his feet are like fine brass I just like to read a quotation to you to help you to better understand the brass the feet of brass look this is from a message the patmas vision from 1960 look at what this was here standing there brass what does brass speak of brass speaks of judgment Divine judgment it shows that his full purpose is coming here on Earth as God to be made flesh and he died for us and took the judgments of God we're not standing around like this waiting for the next shoe to fall because of his feet of brass maybe at first look that that's what you think of when he has feet of brass that he's going to crunch you under his feet oh no this right here is is is a beautiful thing to to hear when you feel that way to be made flesh he died for us and took the judgments of God the Divine judgment and has received a kingdom that's brass and solid and it cannot be moved nothing harder than brass and never nothing would yet uh nothing found yet that would temperate judgment brass speaks of divine judgment P look at the brass serpent in the wilderness what did that brass serpent represent the serpent represented sin but being brass judgment already passed on sin this feet of brass is representation that the Judgment has already been put against my sin he has a fire in his in his eyes that is a love a jealousy for me for my destiny for your destiny it's a love and because that he has a jealousy over you and he has his eyes on you they are fixed on you it is not because he wants to obliterate you and it is not because he wants to put his brass feet on your neck and squash you no he's letting us know that his eyes are jealous over you and over your destiny and because he was so jealous for your destiny the feet of brass that representation that he put his foot on the head of sin and he overcame it he put it under his feet when he died at Calvary and went to the lower parts of the earth and led captivity captive judgment was passed on sin unbelief it was passed on that what I would do what I might be doing right now and what I I've already done it's God taking care of all of it the Judgment was already passed does that make me want to go out and play in sin a while longer oh no that makes me want to say oh Lord thank you for for your cleansing blood thank you for the price that you paid at Calvary thank you that you already did for me what I could not do for myself then we come to the Sardis age and when he spoke to that age the description he gave to them was he that hath the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars now remember we saw in chapter one again that the Seven Stars were the seven Messengers and then we see the seven spirits of God and we go to Isaiah 11: 1 and 2 there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse and a branch shall grow out of his roots and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understand understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and of the fear the reverential awe of the Lord so now instead of just looking at a phrase we can see that there are aspects that have been given to us for overcoming in the end time the spirit of the Lord is not only resting upon him but the spirit of the Lord is resting upon us the spirit of wisdom anybody need wisdom anybody need understanding how about counsel I tell you there are sometimes we just need the counsel of the Lord and sometimes it comes through a human vessel and we have the we have the uh ability to either accept or reject the counsel and if we choose to accept it and something goes wrong we want to take Vengeance on somebody but if someone gives us counsel and we choose not to do it and we end up in trouble we still want to blame somebody this is human nature but it's not God nature it's human nature but it's not God nature and we want to get rid of as much of the human nature the adamic nature as possible because that is not going to give us what we need to overcome in the end time all right so the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and the reverential a or the fear of the Lord these are all things that were are needed that we when when he gave us himself when he gave us his Spirit he poured out his spirit so that all of these things would abide in US us it's not just so far out there friends it's not out of our reach sometimes we do feel like he's playing hideand-seek with us yet all of the things that we're talking about today he's offering them to us you know what he wants out of Us come a little closer just come a little closer you're way too far out there I've got him right here come a little closer and sometimes we're so far out that he has to come a little closer to us so that we can even see him and then we think he's playing hideand-seek because he backs off because he wants us to follow him and we don't want to follow him and he backs off and it feels like a game of hideand-seek seat Lord you told me to follow you and now I can't even find you what are you looking at what are you looking at is your eye single like his eye is single or or are you focused on Sunday but not Monday Tuesday but not Wednesday and so it feels like a game of hide and seek but he's really biding you to come closer come closer Come Away With Me My Love My Fair one all right Philadelphia then we have he that is Holy he that is true he that hath the Key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth now there are a lot of things that we could there are several here and we we're going to have to move fairly quickly 1 Peter 1: 15- 17 but as he which hath called you is Holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation we could talk quite a while about that one our conversation those things that are spoken in secret things that we really don't want anybody else to hear that are not holy they're not Sanctified they're not set apart they're self-serving and that's not what a believer is to be self-serving we are to be selfless so be ye holy in all manner of conversation because it is written be ye holy for I am Holy all right then we have he is true he that is true and we know the scripture I don't have it written down here where he said I am the way and the truth and the life that's who he is there's no falsehood in him none I as a human being may have the ability to lead you astray it's not my desire but I have the ability there whereas him he is truth everything about him is true that's who he is and it also says that he has the Key of David he opens and no man shuts shuts no man open let me just tell you he has all the keys I know he gave Peter the Keys of the Kingdom he passed the keys along to us the Keys of the Kingdom we have the keys but the reason that we have the keys is because he had the keys right and the reason that we have the keys of death Hell In The Grave is because he has the keys he passed them on to us that we don't have to be worried about what is beyond the grave we don't have to be worried that we're not going to make it we don't have to be worried am I saved or am I lost he gave us the key and when he opens the door no man can shut it and when he shuts a door no man can open it and far be it from you or me to uh take a crowbar and try to open it what usually ends up happening is shipwreck train wreck something bad that happens when we try to open a door that he has shut we need to leave it shut we need to let the vines grow up over it we need to let it be behind us and we need to walk through the door that he has opened for us to walk through and quit worrying about what has passed because what is is PED is PED forgetting those things which are behind us if the door has closed let it stay closed if there's a door that's opened he is the one who has the keys and he opened the door in front of you and he gives us the grace to walk through it and we want to see he he gave he's he has the Key of David and David was a praiser David had a voice that he lifted up unto the Lord and sang Pray when David was in a place where that he felt helpless and hopeless he found that praise brought him up out of his place that he was in we already read in Revelation chapter 1 verse 18 where he said I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I'm alive forever more amen and have the keys of hell and of death and we read in John chap 10 Again verses 7-10 then said Jesus unto them again verily verily I say unto you I am the door of the sheep all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the Sheep did not hear them I am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture the thief cometh not but for to kill and to destroy to steal to kill and to destroy I am come that they might have life and that they might might have it more abundantly now if he's the door and he has the keys to be able to shut and to open we as a people need to look at the characteristics of what kind of doors that the the enemy offers because we've been given right here the the uh ingredients of what the thief is trying to do he's trying to steal he's trying to kill he's trying to destroy that's what he does when he opens the door for you that's what inevitably happens he steals he kills and he destroys and that goes across so many spectrums when you use those three words steal kill and destroy it goes across so many spectrums of what the enemy tries to do in our lives but our Lord is the door he has the keys of the door and when we allow him to open and shut doors and lead us into places when he shuts one and leads us into another we're we're allowing this um we're allowing this Pathway to be created for us that is going to help us to overcome in the end time time to overcome the spirit of the age we don't have time to go through all of these Spirits right now but uh maybe eventually we will so let's get Leo deia he says uh he's the amen he's the faithful and true witness he's the beginning of the creation of God he's the amen now I I I found found it very interesting as I just quickly looked at the word amen in the Greek Lexicon and many times in the scripture especially in the gospels where you hear Jesus saying verily or verily verily it's the same Greek word as amen so at the beginning of a discourse of course it means surely truly and of a truth and at the end of a discourse it is so it is so be it and may it be fulfilled now our Lord Yeshua he is the amen he is at the beginning of a discourse he is surely he is truly and he is of a truth he's never going to lead you wrong at the be remember he's the first and the last so at the first he is presenting himself as truth right he's not going to lie to you he's not going to tell you an untruth he's going to give you the truth because he is the truth and so at the beginning of the discourse at the beginning of our Journey we can really say amen and when we get to the end of it we can also say Amen because he is the one that is giving the truth and we are agreeing with that truth and when we say Amen we are putting our pronouncement of so be it let it be so you give a truth let it be so let's just take quickly leod deia what is the prominent Spirit of leoda from the scripture The prominent Spirit of leoda is lukewarm and he said because you are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I'll spew you out of my mouth he is the amen he started it he's going to finish it what is the rest of this he's the faithful and true witness he's the beginning of the creation of God now what has been given this part of him that has been given for the leod deia age which The prominent spirit is lukewarmness he is the amen so that means when he speaks and gives a word it's truth and it is truth that is going to help you to overcome your lukewarmness and when a truth is given and you pronounce with him an amen over it he is the amen he is the Sobe it he is the one that's going to carry it out in your life he's the one who's going to give you the Courage the grace the understanding to be able to overcome lukewarmness in this age because it's going to press in in every way and when you can agree with truth the scripture says Thy word is truth when you agree with the word not why my word not another man's word but the word the Living God when you agree with him when you agree with the amen and you pronounce your amen with his amen you are going to see that lukewarmness leaving your life you're going to see that lukewarmness going by the wayside the problem is because that lukewarmness is pressing in on us in every way shall I give you an updated term for lukewarmness woke woke let everybody be what they want to be and then companies adopt policies to be able to make welcome the woke society and you see the condition that they're in and they have to start reversing it because they're finding out that lukewarmness ain't helping their company that's no more than lukewarmness is going to help you to overcome and combat the spirit of the age he said I would that you would be hot or cold and when I hear him say that when I hear the amen say that I agree agree with the amen I agree with the sobeit I agree with the truth of the age because the truth is what makes us free you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free musicians I invite you today the word word amen is a most remarkable word it was transliterated directly from the Hebrew into the Greek of the New Testament then into Latin and into English and many other languages so that it is practically a universal word this was part of the commentary of the Lexicon it has been called the best known word in human speech the word is directly related in fact almost identical to the Hebrew word for believe amen or faithful thus it came to mean sure or truly an expression of absolute trust and confidence trust and confidence again verse 17 and 18 of the first chapter when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth was dead and behold I am alive forever more amen and have the keys of hell and death I just want to point out one more thing in these two verses all that we have discussed in this sermon three times in these two verses are the phrase I am I am the the first and the last not was I am currently I am he that liveth and was dead he was dead but he is currently living and then he says I am alive forever more that's who he is he is alive for all forever more and he is giving us he has given us it is current it is active energizing alive he has given to us all of his all of his being that we read in chapter one that transfers to chapter 2 a bit for each Church age but if all of the evil culminates in this age the overcoming power culminates Ates in this age and the only way friends that we'll ever overcome all of the spirits of all of the other age is for us to have all of his nature and character and all that he is and was and is ever going to be he he is current he is alive he is active and he's working in me and I I need every bit of who he is every bit there's not one thing that I can leave apart I've got to have him more than ever before I've got to have him stand with me today I've got to have him not a dead letter not another sermon although a sermon can be a part of that living active word I need him come Holy Spirit Come Holy Spirit Come Holy Spirit if your feeler has become ineffective if your feeler has become inactive why don't you
