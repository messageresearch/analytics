[0:00] hello there I'm pastor Shelly from the
[0:03] New Hope revival ministries in Smith
[0:06] Station Alabama and I'm excited to be
[0:09] able to speak to you today on the gospel
[0:11] channel the Lord has established a great
[0:14] friendship and a wonderful partnership
[0:16] with the gospel Channel and we've had
[0:19] great fellowship with those brothers and
[0:22] the precious staff there for a number of
[0:24] years now and now that God has blessed
[0:27] us with a studio of our own in Alabama
[0:31] United States of America we're able to
[0:34] come to you a little more often in this
[0:37] format and I hope that you are tuning in
[0:40] to our program the Eagles cry I believe
[0:44] that the Lord has used it to encourage
[0:46] many of you out there and I also believe
[0:49] that he's going to use it in more
[0:50] profound ways in days to come and I'm
[0:53] excited about that
[0:55] I remember the first time I went to
[0:57] Iceland and met those brothers and saw
[1:00] what they were doing in the vision that
[1:02] they had this tiny little island less
[1:06] than 350,000 people and at that time
[1:10] there were 300,000 tourists that would
[1:12] come every year now I think they're
[1:14] probably even more tourists than ever
[1:17] and that excites me and I I met these
[1:20] people who had a desire to take the
[1:22] gospel not just to Iceland but all
[1:25] across the world and God opened the
[1:28] doors and they've been available to you
[1:31] across the United Kingdom now for for
[1:34] multiple years and expanding all the
[1:38] time by the grace of God we're just so
[1:40] thankful for what he's doing we'd like
[1:43] for you to partner with them in prayer
[1:45] and with your finances if the Lord lays
[1:48] on your heart to sow into the gospel
[1:51] channel then that also makes it
[1:53] available for us to be able to come to
[1:56] you from Alabama on a regular basis
[1:58] these folks are just dedicated to
[2:01] getting the gospel to you to encourage
[2:04] you you know we understand that there
[2:06] are people who will be surfing channels
[2:09] and they will see this and maybe it will
[2:12] catch their eye maybe not
[2:13] but we also believe that by the Spirit
[2:16] of the Lord we can pray a prayer in and
[2:18] you can be arrested to hear what you
[2:21] need to hear
[2:22] I've had many testimonies through the
[2:24] years of people saying I was just
[2:26] flipping the channels and something drew
[2:28] me and so we have a great opportunity if
[2:31] you're a believer you're Christian
[2:33] watching this program we need to partner
[2:35] together in faith and we need to believe
[2:38] that God will use this ministry this
[2:41] television outreach to speak to whoever
[2:44] it is that the Lord has on his heart
[2:46] whoever it is that he wants to be spoken
[2:49] to for such a time as this because we
[2:52] recognize that the Lord deals with this
[2:54] people in cycles and seasons you know
[2:58] what I found is that God will speak to
[3:00] us he will make certain truths certain
[3:03] portions of Scripture come alive at
[3:05] certain seasons of our life and had we
[3:09] come across that truth that revelation
[3:11] months before years before it might have
[3:15] just gone right over our head but years
[3:17] later it comes around it's exactly what
[3:20] we need at the time and it lays upon a
[3:23] foundation line upon line precept upon
[3:26] precept so I'm just excited for an
[3:29] opportunity to to come to greet you to
[3:32] share what's on our heart and to come
[3:35] without pressure you know I have no
[3:37] reputation that I'm trying to maintain I
[3:40] just want to be a servant of Jesus
[3:42] Christ in the end time and I had no
[3:45] ambition I can assure you I had no
[3:48] ambition for television it was not
[3:50] something that was really on my grid
[3:53] that first time that the Lord gave a
[3:56] prophecy and said I'm going to put you
[3:58] there we come from a conservative
[4:01] community of faith and and most people
[4:05] that we're in fellowship with don't even
[4:08] have television in their homes and
[4:10] haven't had them for many years raising
[4:12] their children and yet we realize that
[4:15] with all the evil and with all the junk
[4:18] that can be made available by television
[4:21] it's also a glorious tool to speak to
[4:24] you
[4:25] reach you and to reach literally
[4:29] millions of people like you I remember
[4:32] one time some years ago we were on the
[4:34] gospel channel doing some programming
[4:36] and it may have been our own program the
[4:39] Eagles cry I was actually in Israel at
[4:43] the time that these programs were airing
[4:45] the apartment that we maintained in
[4:48] Jerusalem in the neighborhood of French
[4:51] Hill and an email came in and the email
[4:54] was from the Palestinian territory it
[4:57] was from Ramallah and the truth is
[5:01] Ramallah is only a few miles from the
[5:04] neighborhood where our apartment is but
[5:06] because of the conflict and because of
[5:09] everything that was going on at that
[5:10] time
[5:11] it would have been very difficult for me
[5:13] to have gone into Ramallah
[5:15] knocking on door to door witnessing for
[5:18] Jesus Christ it would have almost been
[5:20] impossible at that particular moment and
[5:23] yet this email comes in from Ramallah
[5:27] telling us what life and what hope was
[5:32] offered by the television program that
[5:34] they saw I'm telling you it excited me
[5:37] then and it excites me to mention it
[5:40] again now because that's the gift that
[5:43] God has given us with television and so
[5:47] we just we just believe that you've got
[5:50] loved ones that you'd like to see saved
[5:52] that you'd like to say born again and
[5:55] they may not ever watch Christian
[5:57] television but while you're praying for
[5:59] them to be saved also pray for somebody
[6:02] else's loved one who might come across
[6:05] the gospel channel or other channels out
[6:08] there where they may hear the gospel
[6:10] especially in an uncompromised manner
[6:13] for the hour that we're living in the
[6:15] bold truth of God's Word is important
[6:19] and it's what people need I find that
[6:21] people are not looking for pretense
[6:23] they're certainly not looking for
[6:25] hypocrisy they're looking for sincere
[6:28] faith and the real character of Jesus
[6:31] Christ to be on display that's our
[6:34] desire and I believe it's the desire of
[6:36] many people who are doing this for a
[6:38] Astri so by you praying for your loved
[6:41] ones we're partnering with you asking
[6:43] God to bring your loved ones in you can
[6:46] also pray for other people's loved ones
[6:48] that might come across this program or
[6:51] other programs on the gospel channel so
[6:54] that way we form a network in prayer and
[6:56] in faith standing together if you have
[6:59] particular prayer needs that you'd like
[7:02] for us to pray about we invite you to
[7:04] call the number on your screen or send
[7:07] an email the one thing I will commit to
[7:09] you is that we will pray individually
[7:13] over your prayer requests I believe that
[7:17] if you send a need and you care enough
[7:20] and you have enough confidence in us to
[7:23] send it this way it's the least that we
[7:25] can do to join together with you in
[7:28] faith and I'm gonna do more than that
[7:30] I'm gonna tell you I expect the
[7:32] testimony I expect a report whenever you
[7:35] get a chance to say God's moving maybe
[7:38] the whole victory is not here yet keep
[7:41] praying and that's exactly what we'll do
[7:43] you see we're in this thing together
[7:44] we're living in the end time and things
[7:47] are very serious out there and if
[7:50] there's ever been a time that we need to
[7:52] draw together exercising our faith and
[7:56] coming together in fellowship with truth
[7:59] this is the hour and so again I just
[8:02] greet you and I'm telling you I'm
[8:05] extremely blessed and excited to be
[8:08] coming to you again today one of the
[8:11] times we were together recently it was a
[8:14] transparent time for me I began to talk
[8:17] about something that was going on in our
[8:18] own faith community where God was
[8:20] speaking to us about how that through
[8:23] the years of waiting on the promises of
[8:26] God to come to pass that it's easy for
[8:29] your hope to become deferred for it to
[8:31] be seized upon by the enemy who wants to
[8:34] discourage us and what happens is in
[8:37] that moment the level of our unbelief
[8:39] starts creeping up a little higher and a
[8:43] little higher until actually there's
[8:45] more unbelief than there is faith now I
[8:48] want you to know that it doesn't take a
[8:50] lot of faith it
[8:52] takes faith to every man is given the
[8:55] measure of faith then faith is certainly
[8:58] like a muscle the more you exercise it
[9:00] the stronger it gets but I don't ever
[9:03] want you to look at faith like I don't
[9:06] have enough I need to get more if I
[9:09] would have had more faith my loved one
[9:11] would have been healed or particular
[9:13] tragedy would have been adverted
[9:16] wouldn't have happened I don't think
[9:18] that's the way God wants us looking at
[9:20] faith I think that there are different
[9:23] levels of faith and even different kinds
[9:25] of faith I think there are different
[9:28] administration's of faith and I just
[9:31] want to talk about that with you a
[9:32] little bit today we did a series I think
[9:35] one time on the Eagles cry about the
[9:37] difference between intellectual faith
[9:39] and faith by revelation I just want to
[9:42] share a little bit of that with the
[9:45] audience today because I truly believe
[9:47] that once faith moves from the realm of
[9:52] just an intellectual concept into that
[9:56] realm or into that dimension of revealed
[10:00] faith by the Spirit of God I believe it
[10:04] changes things in fact as I was thinking
[10:08] about this program today and I was
[10:10] thinking about faith by revelation I was
[10:12] looking at my own life at my times of
[10:16] discouragement where my faith was at
[10:18] that particular moment and I'm persuaded
[10:21] that I wouldn't probably even be here I
[10:24] probably wouldn't be alive to be
[10:27] speaking to you today had it not been
[10:29] for that dimension of faith that's more
[10:34] than just saying I believe but revealed
[10:37] faith faith that comes by the
[10:39] inspiration of the Spirit of God it
[10:42] drops down another notch when I think
[10:46] about the revivalist of the past many
[10:49] great men and women of God used in the
[10:53] great healing revival I think
[10:55] particularly now of of those who had
[10:58] what was called Bulldog faith men like
[11:02] Jack :
[11:03] even before him you
[11:05] precious folk in the United Kingdom
[11:08] would be more familiar with with a Smith
[11:10] Wigglesworth these were men who had
[11:13] faith they didn't just have intellectual
[11:16] faith I believe that's where all faith
[11:19] starts is in the realm of the intellect
[11:22] in the realm of the mind you hear the
[11:25] truth you hear the gospel of Jesus
[11:28] Christ you hear that he has power to
[11:31] save to heal and to deliver and
[11:33] something inside of you says this makes
[11:36] sense you read it in the Bible and
[11:39] something says this is true you don't
[11:43] have the evidence to prove that it's
[11:45] true necessary necessarily it's like the
[11:50] wind we can't see the wind when it's
[11:53] blowing but we know it's blowing by the
[11:55] results so when we look at the results
[11:59] that we have won in our own lives
[12:01] victories that we have won results that
[12:04] we have seen in our own lives it helps
[12:07] us to believe more but in that moment
[12:09] when there's no reason to hope when
[12:12] there's no evidence that would make you
[12:15] believe everything says this is not
[12:19] going to happen and all of a sudden in a
[12:22] moment of Prayer the Spirit of God is
[12:25] quickened on the inside of the inside of
[12:27] who you are and faith drops down kind of
[12:31] like that bulldog faith we're talking
[12:33] about it goes down into another gear
[12:36] like a truck trying to pull itself up
[12:38] the side of a hill on a slippery day on
[12:41] a wintry day and the gear has to shift
[12:44] down into a lower gear to pull a little
[12:48] bit harder that's the kind of faith I'm
[12:50] talking about the Jack Coe kind of faith
[12:53] where at times under the inspiration of
[12:56] the Holy Spirit someone would come with
[12:58] a swelled belly a cancerous tumor
[13:01] growing in their abdomen and by the
[13:03] inspiration of God I'm telling you I
[13:05] don't believe that he punched everybody
[13:07] in the stomach that had an infirmity in
[13:10] the stomach in fact we know that in his
[13:12] ministry he would go service after
[13:15] service without any you know
[13:17] what seems to be almost violent faith a
[13:21] physical demonstration of faith but I
[13:24] believe he was waiting for something and
[13:26] when that moment would come and he knew
[13:29] that he knew that he knew that he knew
[13:30] that God was standing behind him see
[13:33] that was faith by revelation that if I
[13:36] do a certain thing the results are going
[13:39] to be there I don't think that's where
[13:41] we need to start by punching our loved
[13:44] ones in the belly I want you to know
[13:45] that's not in any way what I'm
[13:47] suggesting but what we do need to do is
[13:51] to believe God that our faith will not
[13:54] just be pen and paper faith or I read it
[13:57] on a on a page faith even if the pages
[14:00] in the Bible but the kind of faith that
[14:03] you could say I know that I know that I
[14:07] know that I know it's not I feel it's
[14:10] not I think it's not even I believe it's
[14:13] I know in order to introduce you to
[14:18] faith by revelation my mind immediately
[14:21] goes to a couple of places in scripture
[14:23] and one of those places is Hebrews
[14:26] chapter 11 which is often called the
[14:29] Hall of faith instead of the Hall of
[14:31] Fame because many of God's men are
[14:35] mentioned here and some women who had
[14:38] faith against all odds when all
[14:42] circumstances were against them for
[14:45] instance like Abraham who hoped against
[14:48] hope and Abel and Enoch and Noah and it
[14:52] goes on even Sarah
[14:54] it speaks of of her conception it talks
[14:57] about Isaac and Jacob and Joseph a Moses
[15:01] again is mentioned and Rahab the harlot
[15:04] anyway it's an amazing chapter to read
[15:07] but verse 1 of Hebrews 11 says now faith
[15:11] is the substance of things hoped for the
[15:16] evidence of things not seen if you can
[15:20] see it it doesn't take faith to access
[15:23] it you can just reach out and grab it
[15:26] but if it can't be seen and yet
[15:30] there is a burning hope a burning desire
[15:34] a burning belief that it can be that
[15:38] what hasn't manifested yet can be
[15:43] manifested that what we haven't seen
[15:45] with our eyes yet we can believe until
[15:49] we do see it with our eyes this is how
[15:52] faith operates it doesn't operate by
[15:55] what has already been it operates from
[15:58] that realm of the unseen it is the
[16:01] substance of things hoped for you see
[16:04] there are times in our life when our
[16:06] faith reached out to grab a hold of
[16:08] something and nothing came so what do
[16:11] you do do you you pull your hand in and
[16:13] say just as I thought nothing happened
[16:15] or do you keep your hand out believing
[16:18] until what you believed for is placed in
[16:21] your hand to me that's bulldog faith one
[16:24] of the great generals of God said that
[16:27] the prayer of faith is like a hand that
[16:30] reaches into the heavens and refuses to
[16:33] come back empty-handed
[16:34] I believe when there's no seemingly no
[16:38] reason to keep believing but I'm going
[16:42] to believe anyway and then those there's
[16:44] another verse here that that comes to my
[16:47] mind just a few places down that I I
[16:51] think I would like to look at it's verse
[16:53] 6 actually and it says but without faith
[16:56] it is impossible to please him so faith
[17:01] is not optional because we have to
[17:04] believe first in him and so faith is
[17:08] necessary one of the scriptures that
[17:10] speaks in the Gospels concerning the
[17:13] condition of men's hearts at the time of
[17:16] the end
[17:16] it says nevertheless when Jesus comes
[17:19] when he comes will he find faith in the
[17:22] earth and I'm telling you the answer to
[17:24] that is yes because there's always been
[17:28] a people of faith before Jesus was ever
[17:32] born of a Virgin Mary in Bethlehem there
[17:36] were people of faith the Bible is filled
[17:39] with with the Hebrew people those who
[17:42] believed God by
[17:44] covenant who trusted God who walked with
[17:48] God even when it was very very difficult
[17:50] to do so to the extent that in order to
[17:54] occupy the promise of God the promise
[17:56] that had been made to them they had to
[17:58] physically go in and make it happen so
[18:01] I'm telling you this book this precious
[18:04] Word of God at least the written record
[18:07] of God's Word is a book of faith I think
[18:10] you will find faith from Genesis all the
[18:13] way through to the book of Revelation
[18:15] but without faith it is impossible to
[18:19] please him for he that cometh to God
[18:21] must believe that he is if you're going
[18:27] to come to God and approach him there
[18:30] has to be a belief even an intellectual
[18:33] faith even something that that you've
[18:36] reasoned in your mind there has to be a
[18:40] divine creator maybe you've looked
[18:42] around and you've seen the world and
[18:44] you've you've you've marveled at the
[18:47] miracle of the human body I've often
[18:50] wondered how anyone could study the
[18:53] miracle of the human body and believe
[18:56] that once upon a time a couple of cells
[19:00] in a mud puddle somewhere divided
[19:03] themselves and out walked a man I could
[19:06] never believe something like that but
[19:09] when I read God's record when I read how
[19:13] faithful God has been through history
[19:17] according to the record that is written
[19:20] in his word it's very easy for me to
[19:23] believe that there is a divine creator
[19:26] that there is a loving God who spoke
[19:30] someone said Oh preacher Shelley don't
[19:33] you believe in the Big Bang Theory
[19:35] of course I said I believe in the Big
[19:38] Bang Theory it's real simple God spoke
[19:41] it and there was a bang and the world
[19:44] the earth appeared by the power of the
[19:49] spoken word the world that we know today
[19:52] was created by that which flowed for
[19:57] from God I tell you that's a powerful
[20:01] truth to begin to get a hold of without
[20:04] faith it's impossible to please him for
[20:06] he that cometh to God must believe that
[20:09] he is and I like this next part and that
[20:12] he is a rewarder of them that diligently
[20:16] seek Him I want to tell you something
[20:19] I believe that God is and I believe that
[20:24] he is a rewarder of those who diligently
[20:27] seek Him
[20:29] why because I read it in the Bible yes
[20:32] that was the beginning of my faith I
[20:35] read it something in me said this is the
[20:39] truth there was a witness in my inner
[20:41] spirit this is the truth but that's not
[20:44] why I believe it today
[20:46] I believe it today because the existence
[20:49] of God has been proven to me in my life
[20:54] the way that he has watched after me and
[20:58] cared for me the way that he has
[21:00] strengthened me and led me to navigate
[21:03] difficult circumstances in my life
[21:07] circumstances where the victory that
[21:10] followed could have never been
[21:13] attributed to the work of a man or to
[21:16] the work of a multitude of men so
[21:20] supernatural that only a supernatural
[21:24] God one who is above all who knows all
[21:28] who loved me only a god like that could
[21:32] have orchestrated the circumstances of
[21:35] my life so I now believe that God is not
[21:39] just because I read it in the word but
[21:41] because it has been proven to me by the
[21:44] Spirit by the reality of my own life and
[21:48] I believe that he is a rewarder of them
[21:51] that diligently seek Him no longer just
[21:54] because I read it in the Bible but
[21:57] because God has proven it to me in my
[21:59] own life God is faithful and he rewards
[22:05] faithfulness I often say it like this
[22:09] everything that happened
[22:11] to me it's not good and I can't say that
[22:14] it's good but I can say what the Bible
[22:17] says it is for my good someone said well
[22:22] if God allowed such a terrible thing to
[22:25] transpire in your life that God must be
[22:29] very very cruel and you know I would
[22:31] almost agree with you if God saw in one
[22:37] dimension like you and I see but because
[22:40] our Creator sees in all dimensions I
[22:44] have to believe that it's not cruelty at
[22:47] all it's God knowing me and seeing my
[22:51] beginning and my end he sees the journey
[22:55] from my beginning to my end and he knows
[22:59] exactly what it will take to bring me
[23:03] into the image that he has called his
[23:05] sons to be in here at the end time and
[23:09] he also knows the outcome when I'm in
[23:13] the middle of a dark trial and it looks
[23:15] hopeless and it looks like I might
[23:17] surely be destroyed God isn't wringing
[23:21] his hands and eternity saying oh I
[23:24] wished I knew how this was going to turn
[23:26] out
[23:27] absolutely not before the trial ever
[23:30] begins before the circumstance ever
[23:33] begins in my life God has already seen
[23:37] the end and he knows he has a mission he
[23:41] has all knowledge and he can see exactly
[23:44] where I will be when it's all over how
[23:48] could a loving God asked Abraham to take
[23:51] his only son Isaac up to Mount Moriah
[23:54] and offer him to God how could God make
[23:59] such a requirement of Abraham well the
[24:03] big question for me is how could Abraham
[24:06] do such a thing how could he be willing
[24:08] to do such a thing I'll tell you why
[24:11] because Abraham had a faith that was not
[24:14] just an intellectual concept I think
[24:17] there's a possibility that there's a God
[24:19] out there he had a relationship with God
[24:22] he could hear
[24:24] the voice of God speaking in his inner
[24:27] being way before he even knew a name for
[24:31] the voice that was speaking to him he
[24:35] had learned to trust that voice and to
[24:38] trust that God is working all things for
[24:42] his good he also had a lot of hope by
[24:46] revelation and he knew that even if
[24:49] indeed he got up on top of that mountain
[24:53] took a dagger a knife and took the life
[24:57] of his son Isaac the New Testament tells
[25:01] us that he believed that that his God
[25:05] had power to raise the dead and so it
[25:10] was easier
[25:11] I didn't say easy I said it was easier
[25:14] for Abraham to hear the voice of God in
[25:17] this manner because he trusted the heart
[25:20] of God for him instead of being angry or
[25:26] bitter or hurt instead of saying what
[25:30] kind of God are you that you had asked
[25:33] for my son you gave him to me he was a
[25:35] promise look what I've been through to
[25:37] get him and now you're gonna take him
[25:40] when God said to Isaac going up that
[25:43] mountain that day God will provide
[25:45] himself a sacrifice that wasn't just
[25:49] religious jargon for Abraham no sir that
[25:54] was real faith faith that started in the
[25:59] intellect it started by hearing an inner
[26:02] voice and he had to make a decision do I
[26:05] believe the voice when God said Abram
[26:08] I'm gonna call you out from your people
[26:10] and send you to a land that you don't
[26:12] know anything about and you know Jewish
[26:15] tradition is that that Abraham's father
[26:18] was an idol maker and so Abram grew up
[26:21] with many false gods in his life who
[26:24] never spoke to him who never performed
[26:27] any miracles for him and yet it was the
[26:30] only faith the only religion the only
[26:33] only culture that he knew anything about
[26:35] and then he hears this
[26:37] voice I'm gonna separate you from your
[26:39] people and send you to a land you're
[26:41] gonna go looking for a city that I am
[26:44] building and he had to make a decision
[26:46] in his intellect in his own mind he had
[26:50] to use his own intelligence to make a
[26:52] conscious choice do I believe this voice
[26:56] am I losing my mind or is this a real
[26:59] God speaking to me I believe it was by
[27:03] revelation it was by the plan of god
[27:05] that abraham believed and recognized it
[27:08] started in the realm of intellectual
[27:10] faith but as he watched God unfolding
[27:14] himself revealing himself along the
[27:17] journey it was no longer just an act of
[27:20] obedience based on a thought or on
[27:23] intellectual faith it became faith by
[27:26] revelation and that's why Abraham was
[27:29] able to do not just taking Isaac but but
[27:33] all of those separations we have
[27:35] ministered in the past on the 7
[27:37] separations of Abraham it started out by
[27:41] being separated from his family and even
[27:44] his family that went with him is nephew
[27:46] lot he even eventually had to separate
[27:49] from him because of the arguments and
[27:52] disagreements among the herdsmen and so
[27:55] it seems that Abram and later Abraham
[27:57] knew only separations and sacrifice for
[28:02] so long for a big portion of his life's
[28:05] journey then how did he keep doing it
[28:08] again and again and over and over again
[28:10] I don't think it was just because I
[28:13] heard a voice and I believed it was true
[28:15] I think it was much more than that I
[28:17] think God took that intellectual concept
[28:21] of faith and saw the obedience in in
[28:24] Abraham's heart in Abraham's heart and
[28:27] because of that because of that
[28:30] obedience God said I'm gonna I'm gonna
[28:33] begin to reveal by my spirit what faith
[28:36] can really accomplish and so it's a
[28:38] marvelous journey this journey of faith
[28:42] when we were talking to you recently we
[28:45] spoke about the man who brought his his
[28:48] son to Jesus
[28:50] who was very vexed of the enemy in fact
[28:54] the demon spirit that was binding this
[28:56] lad would throw him into the water and
[28:59] throw him into the fire and try to
[29:01] destroy him ofttimes the Bible said and
[29:05] this father in desperation brought his
[29:07] son to the disciples of our Lord and
[29:09] asked them to cast this spirit off of
[29:13] their of his son and they were not able
[29:16] to do anything about it and so he came
[29:19] to Jesus and Jesus said to him if you
[29:23] believe if you can only believe all
[29:26] things are possible the response that
[29:30] Jesus gave was because of the way the
[29:33] father approached him saying I brought
[29:35] my son to your disciples they couldn't
[29:38] do anything about it is there something
[29:40] you can do it was not really the boldest
[29:43] act of faith and yet there was some
[29:46] faith present if for no other reason
[29:49] because of the desperation that was in
[29:52] that man's heart and so jesus said all
[29:54] things are possible only believe to him
[29:57] that believeth all things are possible
[29:59] and I love what the man said he said
[30:02] lord I believe help thou my unbelief we
[30:06] were talking about our in every one of
[30:08] our lives we have experienced that
[30:11] moment that season of unbelief and if
[30:16] it's not dealt with now it doesn't just
[30:20] go away those nagging doubts and that
[30:23] element of unbelief it expands and it
[30:27] grows it actually affects us in the same
[30:30] way that worry and fear would affect us
[30:33] it's like acid in our in our inner being
[30:36] and so it has to be dealt with it has to
[30:39] be confronted and we we don't come in
[30:42] shame and and it is it is perhaps
[30:45] embarrassing maybe you do feel some
[30:48] shame because your faith has wavered and
[30:50] you have struggled with unbelief but I'm
[30:53] encouraging you not to stand before the
[30:55] Lord today covered in shame for that
[30:59] inner struggle that takes place what I'm
[31:02] asking you to do is
[31:04] before your loving father and ask him to
[31:06] take your faith to another level to
[31:10] reveal to you by the spirit from his
[31:14] word and even from your own life how
[31:18] good he is and how it is his desire to
[31:22] bring you closer to him and how that
[31:26] he's going to guide you and protect you
[31:28] and keep you through all the
[31:29] circumstances of your life and
[31:31] everything that happens in your life
[31:33] it's not going to be good and I'm not
[31:36] going to tell you that it is but
[31:39] remember again it's for your good God is
[31:43] working something in your life he is
[31:46] working something in my life that's
[31:48] going to show forth a greater glory a
[31:52] greater reflection of who he is if you
[31:57] think things are troubled now in the
[31:58] earth I'm telling you this is the
[32:01] beginning things are going to wax worse
[32:04] and worse the closer we get to the
[32:07] coming of the Lord we're going to see
[32:09] the world front getting darker and
[32:12] darker we're going to see hatred getting
[32:15] stronger and stronger the Bible tells us
[32:18] that men's hearts will fail people will
[32:21] have heart failure and heart attacks for
[32:25] fear why are you telling us this I
[32:28] thought you were trying to encourage us
[32:29] I am if you and I allow the Spirit of
[32:33] God to reveal faith to us to bring us to
[32:38] another dimension and another level of
[32:40] our faith then when those things begin
[32:43] to happen in the earth around us people
[32:45] who don't have the Lord people who don't
[32:48] have that faith they're gonna need
[32:50] something they're going to need somebody
[32:53] and I'm not sure that you and I would be
[32:56] prepared to help them with just our
[32:58] intellectual faith the kind that begins
[33:01] in Sunday school when we hear that Jesus
[33:03] died on the cross for us and it's easy
[33:07] for us to accept that as little children
[33:09] and so faith begins in that realm in the
[33:13] realm of our mind in the realm of our
[33:15] intellect but something tell
[33:17] me that it's going to take a much deeper
[33:20] faith a much stronger faith in that to
[33:23] be able to provide what's going to be
[33:26] desperately needed perhaps you know some
[33:29] of the things that are going on in our
[33:30] own country tragic shootings and loss of
[33:35] life and there are people who need
[33:38] ministry now it hasn't just affected one
[33:42] little town or one Church or one one
[33:44] congregation or or one family but this
[33:48] is the kind of thing that has ripple
[33:49] effect and it touches a nation and I
[33:52] wouldn't I wouldn't be afraid to say
[33:54] that this tragedy has affected people
[33:57] around the world I want you to know that
[34:00] in that moment there are people right
[34:03] now who need ministry who need love and
[34:06] who need prayers we can't all fly to the
[34:09] place where tragedy takes place but we
[34:12] can go down on our knees and we can pray
[34:15] and we can believe that God will send
[34:18] those who are available and you know it
[34:21] might be you it might be he might send
[34:24] us he might tell us to go out of our
[34:27] comfort zone to minister in that moment
[34:30] we're going to have to go with something
[34:32] more than just a bible school story
[34:34] we're gonna have to go with something
[34:37] that is so supernatural so spirit
[34:39] revealed so powerful that no matter what
[34:42] the enemy says to us or what he does to
[34:45] us on the rest of our journey that we
[34:47] have the grace to bring our unbelief to
[34:50] God lord I believe help thou my unbelief
[34:53] and now I'm gonna keep pressing on in
[34:56] faith and I believe that there are those
[34:59] of us right now who are being positioned
[35:01] to operate in that kind of faith by
[35:04] revelation I was thinking about my
[35:06] friend Peter I say that because I kind
[35:11] of like this character this man called
[35:15] Peter in the Bible I know he had a
[35:18] temper short fuse at times I know he was
[35:21] uneducated I know he was a fisherman but
[35:24] I'm telling you something he opened up
[35:26] his heart for revelation what he lacked
[35:30] in in
[35:31] training you know the kind of knowledge
[35:33] that you learn through school or through
[35:36] education what he lacked in that area
[35:38] I'm telling you he made up for it in
[35:41] that realm of believing he didn't pass
[35:44] every test with flying colors but in the
[35:47] end he came through because he had more
[35:50] than just the intellectual faith he had
[35:53] faith that had come to him by revelation
[35:55] in Matthew chapter 26 verses 30 through
[35:59] 35 it talks to us about Peters betrayal
[36:04] he actually betrayed the Lord he
[36:07] actually said I don't know what you're
[36:10] talking about
[36:12] i-i-i-i I would never I would never deny
[36:17] you know that's what he had told the
[36:19] Lord earlier I will never deny and now
[36:22] it's just a little maid who says you're
[36:24] one of them your speech betrays you and
[36:27] he says I have no idea what you are
[36:30] talking about in Matthew 26 30 through
[36:33] 35 it's it's actually Peter telling the
[36:37] Lord these things I will never do this I
[36:39] will never he said in verse 33 Peter
[36:42] answered and said unto Him though all
[36:44] men shall be offended because of thee
[36:47] yet will I never be offended and that's
[36:49] when Jesus said to him verily I say unto
[36:52] you this night before the crow thou
[36:54] shalt deny me three times and Peter said
[36:57] unto him though I should die with thee
[37:00] yet will I not deny thee likewise also
[37:02] said all of the disciples Peter wasn't
[37:06] lying Peter had just never been faced
[37:09] with that moment that kind of difficulty
[37:12] had never been a part of who Peter was
[37:14] it had not been a circumstance that he
[37:17] had ever had to deal with before he
[37:20] wasn't lying to the master he believed
[37:22] he believed that the intellectual
[37:25] concept of faith that he had thus far
[37:28] was going to be enough to get him
[37:31] through any tests that came along and he
[37:34] would pass it all with flying colors in
[37:38] Luke chapter 22 verse 31 through 34
[37:43] this is when Jesus had said to Peter
[37:45] Simon Simon behold Satan hath desired to
[37:48] have you that he may sift you as wheat
[37:50] but I have prayed for you that thy faith
[37:53] fail not and when thou art converted
[37:55] strengthen thy brethren we believe in
[37:58] the chronology of the scripture that
[38:00] that that this event of course took
[38:03] place before the denial Jesus is saying
[38:06] you're going to be sifted you're going
[38:09] to be tempted but I'm going to pray for
[38:11] you that your faith fail not well when
[38:14] when the rubber got down to the road we
[38:17] say sometimes and when the temptation
[38:20] was actually there it seems that Peter
[38:23] yielded and that he failed the test
[38:26] and yet Jesus prayed that your faith
[38:28] fell not so what are you gonna do with
[38:30] that preacher man I'm gonna tell you the
[38:32] truth Jesus prayed that Peters faith
[38:35] would not fail and it did not the faith
[38:39] that Peter had was not enough to pass
[38:43] this test with flying colors and he
[38:46] denied and he ran away in shame but that
[38:49] same Peter that very same Peter who
[38:54] failed the Lord whose faith was not
[38:57] strong enough in that moment but it
[39:00] wasn't destroyed he didn't allow his
[39:04] mistake his failure to destroy his faith
[39:08] in the Lord Jesus Christ it definitely
[39:12] affected how he felt about himself but
[39:15] it did not affect how he looked at the
[39:18] Lord I think that's very very powerful
[39:21] because in our lives we will fail and it
[39:25] will look like our faith was not enough
[39:27] to sustain us do we fall into bitterness
[39:30] do we give up like so many people do I'm
[39:34] gonna quit the church I'm gonna quit God
[39:36] what's God ever done for me whoa what
[39:39] about all those other times what about
[39:42] his track record in your life we can't
[39:45] forget that can we if we fail today let
[39:49] it be because we miss stepped but don't
[39:53] put that on God don't hang that on him
[39:57] and don't allow the enemy to use your
[39:59] failure to cast doubt on who God is if
[40:03] you will allow the Lord he'll pour some
[40:06] oil on your faith he'll give you deeper
[40:10] revelation and your faith will go to
[40:13] another level and nothing that the enemy
[40:16] would bring into your path would cause
[40:19] you to completely to totally lose faith
[40:22] and give up in Matthew chapter 16 I love
[40:28] this so very much this is when Jesus
[40:30] came to to Caesarea Philippi and his
[40:34] disciples were around him and and I like
[40:38] to visit this place when I'm in Israel
[40:40] it's it's in modern times called Baniyas
[40:43] and you can still see the the remainders
[40:47] the the archaeological discoveries
[40:52] through the years of the ruins of some
[40:56] of these temples because Caesarea
[40:59] Philippi was known to be a place where
[41:01] there were many pagan temples temples
[41:04] dedicated from from anything they were
[41:07] worshipping anything from the Caesar to
[41:10] pan to the goat God a God who was was
[41:14] personified or who was displayed as
[41:18] dancing goats so these were some pretty
[41:21] confused people worshiping in these
[41:23] temples in Caesarea Philippi and Jesus's
[41:26] passing through this area with his
[41:30] disciples and he asked them in the
[41:32] hustle and bustle of all of this
[41:34] idolatry whom do men say that I the Son
[41:37] of Man am and that's in verse 13 and
[41:40] they said some say you're John the
[41:42] Baptist and some say Elias others
[41:45] Jeremiah or one of the prophets and he
[41:47] says to them who do you say that I am
[41:51] and I don't know how long there was a
[41:54] gap you know the scripture doesn't tell
[41:56] us if there was a five-minute pause and
[41:58] no one said anything but the way this is
[42:02] worded it makes me believe that Peter
[42:04] did not hesitate he said thou art
[42:09] listen bleh he said thou art the Christ
[42:12] the Son of the Living God in Jesus
[42:18] Yeshua answered and said unto Him
[42:20] blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh
[42:23] and blood hath not revealed it unto thee
[42:25] but my father which is in heaven and I
[42:28] say also under thee thou art Peter and
[42:30] upon this rock I will build my church
[42:33] and the gates of Hell shall not prevail
[42:37] against it
[42:39] how could Peter make such a statement
[42:42] thou art the Messiah thou art the Christ
[42:44] the Son of the Living God I'm telling
[42:48] you I believe that it was by revelation
[42:51] that Peter was able to identify once and
[42:54] for all
[42:54] who Jesus who Yeshua actually was we
[42:59] find out later that when we're looking
[43:02] at at Peter's life here was the time he
[43:05] denied that he was even identified with
[43:08] the Lord but remember he didn't deny the
[43:11] Lord he was denying his relationship
[43:14] with the Lord I want you to pay some
[43:17] very close attention and put some
[43:20] thought power into this statement he
[43:24] denied I don't know him I'm not one of
[43:28] them I'm not one of his followers these
[43:33] are the kinds of things that these
[43:35] verses translate as but he didn't say to
[43:38] that little woman he's not the Messiah
[43:41] he's not the Son of the Living God he
[43:45] just denied having relationship with him
[43:48] he denied being identified with him he
[43:52] could never deny who he was because it
[43:57] had been revealed to him by the Spirit
[44:00] of the Lord I think it's very
[44:03] interesting because that wasn't all of
[44:06] Peter struggles we read of some other
[44:08] struggles we read of a time when the
[44:10] Lord said get behind me Satan when he
[44:14] was dealing with the spirit that was
[44:16] operating in Peters life he said in
[44:19] Matthew 16 21 through 23
[44:22] in verse 23 get thee behind me Satan
[44:25] thou art an offence unto me for thou
[44:28] savourest not the things that be of God
[44:30] but those that be of men so in that
[44:33] moment Peter was not thinking savoring
[44:37] adoring the things of God he was hung up
[44:41] on the common thoughts of men on the
[44:45] world around him on what was going on
[44:47] circumstances of his own life of his own
[44:50] identity and so the Lord rebuked him he
[44:54] didn't destroy him he didn't cast him
[44:57] out of the fold in the same manner that
[45:00] Peter didn't deny who the Lord was he
[45:03] just denied that he had relationship
[45:05] with him it was by revelation that he
[45:09] knew Jesus you are the Messiah the Son
[45:14] of the Living God what I'm trying to say
[45:17] is that each time the Spirit of God
[45:19] reveals truth to us each time that we
[45:23] see it in our own personal life and we
[45:26] know that the Spirit of God is
[45:28] quickening something to us and we know
[45:31] that it was God who did it our faith is
[45:33] strengthened unbelief may still creep up
[45:38] we may still fail we may even deny our
[45:42] relationship with him but once who Jesus
[45:46] is has been revealed to you I don't
[45:49] believe you will ever deny who he is in
[45:53] fact I believe that even if you walk
[45:56] away if you choose not to be in
[45:58] relationship with him I think you may
[46:01] say some things that you regret later
[46:03] but I think there's always something in
[46:05] your heart pulling you back because of
[46:09] the revelation that you received I'm
[46:11] counting on that because I believe there
[46:14] are those who are what we call
[46:15] backslidden those who have fallen away
[46:18] from the Lord those who have let their
[46:20] unbelief get so big in their life until
[46:24] they just gave up on trying to keep a
[46:28] relationship they gave up on that
[46:31] day-to-day walk with Jesus Christ
[46:35] in fact some
[46:36] people have never even been taught or
[46:40] have never even understood that a
[46:42] day-to-day relationship with God is
[46:45] possible and that it wasn't just for
[46:48] Abraham or Noah our Peter it's also
[46:52] available for you in order to have faith
[46:57] we have to believe that God is and we
[46:59] have to believe that he is a rewarder of
[47:02] those who diligently seek Him
[47:04] so let's seek him don't don't remain in
[47:09] your failures don't let your past keep
[47:13] you from moving forward I don't care
[47:16] what you've done it doesn't matter to me
[47:19] what you've done my faith my confidence
[47:23] is in his ability to forgive to deliver
[47:28] and to set free if you once knew the
[47:31] Lord and you've walked away from him now
[47:33] for many many years and you say I've
[47:35] wasted my life well it's true you've
[47:39] wasted time that you could have been
[47:41] using for the glory of God but I've got
[47:45] good news for you and that is God by
[47:47] nature is a redeemer in fact everything
[47:51] that's going on in your life right now
[47:53] is about Redemption He desires to bring
[47:57] every one of us back to the original
[47:59] thoughts that he had about us before the
[48:02] foundation of the world and so if you've
[48:05] wasted time God knows that he knows what
[48:08] you could have been doing and what you
[48:09] should have been doing but he also knows
[48:12] and knew before you knew exactly what
[48:16] you were going to be doing and he has
[48:19] this amazing ability to redeem time he
[48:23] can take those years that are wasted if
[48:25] you're willing to surrender to him if
[48:28] you're willing to confess your unbelief
[48:30] if you're willing to pray ask the Lord
[48:33] to open up a relationship that you've
[48:36] never known with him before take time to
[48:39] read God's Word and take time to let the
[48:42] Spirit of the Lord quicken it and make
[48:44] it alive to you it's one of the reasons
[48:47] why we need preaching God can reveal
[48:50] self to us when we read the word on our
[48:52] own individually that's absolutely the
[48:55] truth but the Bible says that he has
[48:57] chosen the foolishness of preaching and
[48:59] that faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[49:01] by the word and how can we hear the word
[49:04] unless it's preached to us unless it's
[49:07] delivered to us you need fellowship with
[49:10] God's people you need individual time
[49:13] private time with him in reading his
[49:17] word and in worshiping him and praising
[49:20] him for the things that you have watched
[49:22] him do in your life and if you're
[49:25] willing to recommit to him and let him
[49:29] reveal and unfold to you a greater
[49:32] relationship if you're willing to have a
[49:35] greater dependency on him you can't do
[49:39] it by yourself listen I cannot do it by
[49:43] myself that's been proven to me time and
[49:46] time again I know it's true and that's
[49:49] why I can so boldly say you can't do it
[49:52] by yourself
[49:52] but again the good news is you don't
[49:55] have to because the Lord is willing and
[49:58] he's ready and he's reaching out for you
[50:01] perhaps even right now he can take all
[50:05] that wasted time all those moments of of
[50:09] loss what looks like days you could
[50:12] never get back and he can so fill you
[50:14] with a burning passion for his kingdom
[50:17] he can draw you forward in such an
[50:20] accelerated manner that you'd be able to
[50:22] accomplish more in the time that you
[50:25] have left on the planet than you might
[50:27] would have ever been able to do in those
[50:29] years and furthermore were they really
[50:32] wasted years I don't know if all was
[50:35] lost because what I find out about my
[50:38] life is even in those moments when I was
[50:41] really spinning my wheels when I wasn't
[50:44] going anywhere when I wasn't really
[50:46] taking any new territory in there in the
[50:49] realm of the Spirit or growing in the
[50:51] Lord it was still part of the journey it
[50:53] was still part of preparation and if I'm
[50:56] willing to go back and revisit some of
[50:58] those darker moments in my life
[51:00] sometimes there are lessons that I can
[51:03] see
[51:04] now that I couldn't even see then so
[51:07] that's another way that God can redeem
[51:08] the time that you were not serving him
[51:11] with all that you had to offer he just
[51:15] wants your heart it's not your hands
[51:17] it's not your work it's not your labor
[51:20] first and foremost he wants your heart
[51:23] he wants you to surrender everything
[51:26] that you have to him and let him draw
[51:29] from you everything that he's given you
[51:33] already in giftings and in callings I
[51:36] believe that every person listening to
[51:39] me now created of our Father I
[51:42] understand that you were born of a union
[51:45] between your mother and father but I
[51:46] also understand that it was God who
[51:48] placed that spirit who you are you
[51:52] became a living soul because of that
[51:54] spirit that was placed in that little
[51:56] embryo that little baby that was forming
[51:59] in your mother's belly the circumstances
[52:01] of your conception may not have been
[52:04] beautiful and the circumstances of your
[52:06] birth may not have been beautiful and
[52:08] the circumstances of your early life may
[52:11] not have been beautiful but I'm telling
[52:13] you if you'll let Jesus come in and rule
[52:16] and reign in your heart your life can be
[52:19] beautiful now because the beauty of life
[52:21] is not about its circumstances it's
[52:24] about the measure of peace that you can
[52:26] find Jesus Yeshua is SAR Shalom he is
[52:31] the Prince of Peace I'd like to share
[52:33] this with you before we pray there was a
[52:37] great man of God who ministered over a
[52:40] period of time from the late 40s all the
[52:43] way to the middle 60s
[52:45] his name was William Branham and I know
[52:48] that many of you are familiar with this
[52:50] great miracle ministry and although
[52:52] there have been all kinds of things
[52:55] confusing thoughts and criticisms that
[52:59] have surrounded his ministry I've
[53:01] studied his teaching I've studied his
[53:04] life now for for many years over 25
[53:08] years and in that period of time I've
[53:11] come to learn some really precious
[53:14] things about who Jesus is
[53:17] when when brother branham was in his
[53:21] early days of life he had married he had
[53:26] a son and a baby girl and if you know
[53:31] anything about his life story you'll
[53:32] know that he felt the call he had a
[53:36] commission even from the time he was a
[53:38] child the Lord told him that he was
[53:40] going to to use him and that he should
[53:42] keep himself pure and clean in life etc
[53:46] and he had this experience where he he
[53:49] met these Pentecostal people he had the
[53:52] only only maybe Church upbringing he had
[53:58] no Christian upbringing and the only
[54:00] church that he had been around up until
[54:03] that point was was the denominational
[54:05] Church one that perhaps wasn't teaching
[54:08] the full gospel the power of the baptism
[54:11] of the Holy Ghost and and those things
[54:14] that are related to the Holy Spirit he
[54:16] meets these people coming back from a
[54:19] trip who are you know he saw things he
[54:22] had never seen before and he experienced
[54:25] things that he had never experienced
[54:26] before he had an opportunity to share
[54:28] and the next thing you know they wanted
[54:30] him to come preach all over the country
[54:33] and he went home to tell his wife and
[54:35] what God was doing and his mother-in-law
[54:38] was very very disappointed because she
[54:42] felt like that Pentecostal people were
[54:44] those folks from the wrong side of the
[54:46] tracks and you're not gonna drag my
[54:48] daughter among those people in fact she
[54:50] just called them trash and I don't know
[54:52] if you know anything about the origins
[54:54] of the Pentecostal movement in America
[54:56] but that's how it was looked at so
[54:58] brother Branham made a terrible decision
[54:59] in his life to listen to his wife to his
[55:03] mother-in-law to not go to stay where he
[55:06] was and I'm sure that he could have had
[55:09] a measure of success in that but God was
[55:11] calling him to something higher it was
[55:15] under tragic circumstances that there
[55:17] was a flood in his hometown and
[55:20] tuberculosis was rampant and pneumonia
[55:23] was rampant and he ended up losing his
[55:25] his precious little baby girl Sharon
[55:28] rose and he lost his wife
[55:31] hope and it was devastating to him he
[55:36] tells a story that he was one day
[55:39] standing out by the grave he had a
[55:42] little boy still who needed his mother
[55:46] his wife was gone his little baby girl
[55:49] was gone and he was standing there and
[55:50] and quite a reputable man from the
[55:53] community stopped and saw him standing
[55:55] by the grave and walked over to him and
[55:57] he said called him by his first name he
[55:59] said bill how did you do it how are you
[56:02] making it how are you how are you
[56:04] getting by how did you keep your
[56:07] religion with all that tragedy that
[56:11] you've been through and that's kind of
[56:13] an expression that's used here in the
[56:15] south your religion although it's got to
[56:18] be much more than religion it's got to
[56:19] be a relationship and brother Bentham
[56:21] proved that he had more than religion he
[56:24] had a relationship but he said to this
[56:26] man he said all I I didn't I didn't I
[56:31] didn't keep my religion it kept me what
[56:36] he was talking about was more than what
[56:38] we understand his religion he was
[56:40] talking about faith my faith kept me I
[56:44] couldn't have kept my faith but my faith
[56:47] refused to let go of me
[56:50] this is the kind of faith I'm going to
[56:52] believe God to make real in your life
[56:55] that kind of faith that's revealed by
[56:58] the spirit not based on circumstances no
[57:01] matter what you're going through if you
[57:04] will let God reveal that measure of
[57:06] faith to you you can hold on no matter
[57:08] what's going on Father in the name of
[57:10] Jesus Christ we pray right now for every
[57:13] need I'm asking you Lord to reveal that
[57:16] kind of faith by the Holy Spirit to
[57:18] every needy person watching this program
[57:21] right now I'm going to believe Lord that
[57:24] their faith if they're willing to open
[57:26] up their lives that by the spirit their
[57:29] faith will go to another level and that
[57:31] their faith will hold them no matter
[57:34] what they're facing in life we ask this
[57:36] in the precious name of the lord jesus
[57:38] christ and for his glory well I have to
[57:41] stop I'm not finished but I have to stop
[57:44] I'd like to pray for you if anything
[57:47] that was spoken today ministered to you
[57:50] if you could relate to it I'd be so
[57:53] delighted if you'd phone the ministry if
[57:55] you send an email we would be glad to
[57:58] pray for you we'd be glad to send these
[58:01] scriptures to you if you didn't get to
[58:02] mark them down and you'd like to have
[58:04] them anything that we could do in that
[58:06] way to encourage you that's what we
[58:08] would very much like to do let your
[58:11] intellectual faith move to a higher
[58:13] level by the Spirit of God deal with
[58:17] your unbelief and let your faith hold
[58:19] you anchor you no matter what you're
[58:22] facing it's a real pleasure to be able
[58:25] to speak to you today until we meet
[58:27] again god bless you bye bye for now
[58:32] [Music]
[58:38] you
[58:44] you
