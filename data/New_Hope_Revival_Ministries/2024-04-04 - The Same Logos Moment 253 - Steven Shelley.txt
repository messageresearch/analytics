Description:
Nothing can hold back the Bride of Christ in these last days. She's emerging from oppression, depression, and bondage, empowered by the same spirit that fell on Pentecost.

No habit, vice, lust, or devil can enslave her. It's a time of spiritual abundance, but it's up to us to embrace it fully. Let's not just feast on the Word but also on His glorious presence.
