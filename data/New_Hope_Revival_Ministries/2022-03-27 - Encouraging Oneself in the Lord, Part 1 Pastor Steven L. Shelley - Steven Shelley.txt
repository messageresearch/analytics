hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah is it good today hallelujah lord we are so thankful to be gathered together this morning lord hallelujah hallelujah do you have a need by the uplifting of your hand today yeah i know there are many in the house many on the stream someone has turned in a prayer request for a 14 year old young man who tried to take his life he's still alive but barely and we want to cover that whole family and that situation to the lord in prayer that god would undertake there will be a number of people traveling this week to get here for friday saturday and sunday and we're only going by those who have committed to come but we're looking for i don't know somewhere between 35 to 50 visitors from out of state and we're asking the lord to watch over them every step of the way and i also want to request prayer for a need let me let me pull it up so i can get it just right but i've had two of our former amish brethren to contact me this week and they're asking us to pray for a little baby that'll be about 10 days old today born to amos and his wife amos miller and his wife ari i believe is how you say it she's the baby is a little girl nine days old very weak not able to take in any nourishment they really need a miracle this is sister elizabeth's oldest daughter's baby that we're praying for so this is an emergency need that god would move and undertake for them pray for the meetings that god will do all that he purposes to do and that i will not be in his way or any of us that we won't get in his way that we'll just let him do whatever it is that he purposes to do we know that god has an appointment with us i know it amen to the lord in the time of their loss particularly sister anita that god will rescue her and bring her through with great grace i know that there's not been anything said publicly that i know of about the funeral i've been checking the obituary at the funeral home and it has not been updated but the last contact i had with sister with the crystalline and also stephanie is have there been any changes crystalline so the funeral will be on saturday april 9th that's not the saturday of the meetings sister anita wanted to make sure that it was not during the meeting i appreciate that so much what love she has for us to do that so the funeral will be at the pentecostal church in lagrange where brother steve has pastored it will be on saturday april the 9th i think at 2 o'clock 2 o'clock and we're expecting that the lord will minister to every grieving heart but we're also expecting there to be the presence of the lord to move as our brother would have desired that to be the case so um you know it's awful to say but i look forward to what god will do and we had i had a phone call on friday from the sheriff sister flo's friend the sheriff over in troop county is that right he's about the nicest fellow you could ever want to talk to on the phone he said preacher i'm coming to the revival and i'm

[Applause] you may be seated we're so thankful for you being in the house of the lord with us this morning there are those who are missing today but we are so thankful that you have come brother hawk and his family brother r.j and his family are still out of town and we'll be traveling so we ask god to give them mercy and traveling grace as they go as they come there they've already gone now now they're coming home uh brother and sister greeley are out of town this weekend as you all heard tuesday night preaching for highlands bible tabernacle where brother lindsay mcgrady is the pastor and these are very old friends of ours and they are experiencing a few days of rest and recuperation in hawaii yep we're in salem this morning but that's all right we're in god's presence we got one little picture posted that's all but i'm hoping they'll show us something else pretty about hawaii it belongs to us you know so we ought to have to get over there at least one time to claim our inheritance right but i told brother greeley what an honor it is that a pastor who's going to be away from his congregation would call you and ask you to come and fill in for him on thursday night and again on sunday evening and stay in their home while they're away i think you know that's real trust and hospitality and uh appreciated that so much that's the kind of people they are that's the kind of people the greeleys are but we miss them we uh i would like to apologize because sometimes i have it all written down to call out the birthdays and i just get sidetracked and go to preaching and and forget about it and i hope you'll know that it's not because it's you it's not because i want to miss your birthday but or your anniversary but uh it's because sometimes it's just a lot to remember when you get up here but let's continue to remember sister audrey as she is with her mother sister chambers in jamaica that god will be with them also we want to pray for sister tebow all the time that god will continue to strengthen her she was able to go to the wedding last weekend which was a real blessing and i had a beautiful picture brother billy sent me a beautiful picture of her and i know that she's in pain and i know that she's going through a lot of things under the chemo but she certainly looked beautiful and radiant in that picture and that made me very happy and we're looking forward to the day that all of that is behind her and she's worshiping with us again and we haven't forgotten her so i was supposed to mention last sunday that it was uh rebecca botchway who is one of our streamers sister botsway who's been here her daughter's birthday last sunday and i didn't mention it and uh a little estee esther had her birthday on monday of last week and brother miller brother truman miller will be here for the meetings from missouri isn't that wonderful we're looking forward to them being here it was brother truman's birthday on tuesday and he doesn't care whether you mention it or not but since he don't care i want to be sure to do it sister phoebe's birthday was on thursday and we love sister phoebe and we wish that she could be here from pennsylvania for these meetings and it was also sister flo's anniversary and her husband has been gone long long time but uh it was still a very special day in her life there's no doubt about that god knows what he's doing tomorrow is brother and sister greeley's anniversary they could be in another service somewhere or they may be streaming this meeting today and if they happen to stream or watch in the archive we want to wish them a very happy anniversary and say that we love you both let's just thank god for brother and sister greeley [Applause] some of the newer ones that are coming i don't have your birthday so if you'll text it to me we'll get it added to the calendar so we can embarrass you like we embarrass everybody else we don't want you to be left out of the fun next saturday you know it's it's just kind of unfortunate that it was right in the middle of our meetings and we don't get to do much of a celebration for her except to shake her hand and say happy birthday because it is monumental sister elfrida has a birthday next saturday that to me is i don't even believe it i don't believe it if i didn't have it on paper i would not believe it i saw her up here worshiping the lord today her skin her face was radiant and she does not look her coming age can we tell or can we she's a little bit uh blushing but she said 80 sure can you all imagine that sister alfreda is going to be 80 years old next saturday it's just it's just unbelievable how did these years go by so quickly to have the health that she has and the strength of mind that she has and the desire to get up here and worship god in these services i don't even think we have to mention it anymore because it's just a number but we want to say happy birthday to you early we'll do it again on your birthday but god bless you eight zero in her family that's relatively young right because you have quite a few siblings that are older than you are the oldest is 90 and the youngest is 76 77 and at least at least two or three of those siblings are streaming this service this morning so we just say isn't god good isn't he good to sister wagner and sister lydia and sister adina god has been so good to them and we're so thankful for the goodness of the lord now uh we need some help on friday morning or whenever you all can decide that it can be done but we need some help getting the little tents up we're gonna put them right out here and hope it doesn't rain and get windy but we need some covering and protection because we've had another little chili snap you know just about the time you take things out and put them outside and get then the chill comes back i'm thankful and if you're if you're one of them complaining about it do not come to me in july and tell me anything about how hot it is you just enjoy the cool while you can but we're going to be feeding everyone you're going to be feeding everyone because it was within a few hours that most of you had responded quickly to say what you would bring and what you would do and you know i'm i know i'm an emotional person but i teared it it brought tears to my eyes because i said you just asked the people to help and they just help there's no begging necessary they just do it and they're bold about it and they help us so that we don't have to be concerned about it and i want to thank every one of you we're going to be feeding everyone friday night saturday at lunchtime for those who come to spend some time of fellowship on the campground saturday night after the service and then sunday morning or sunday afternoon after the service we're going to have a a great time together everyone bringing something and we need to make sure that we bring enough because we don't really know who all is coming we're expecting at least one fifteen passenger van from our uh brothers and sisters former amish brothers and sisters and uh we are looking for for that many and more from other places and it's going to be a wonderful time i wouldn't miss it i'll tell you that right now i believe that it's a moad i do it's not one of those feasts of the lord mentioned in the bible but i tell you i believe it's a divine appointment with us friday night seven o'clock saturday night six o'clock sunday morning 11 o'clock and uh we're not going to have any time to rush out we're going to let the lord have his way we're going to worship him and see what god will do we're needy we have needs here but every person who's coming is needy they're coming because they have needs and because they're i was thinking this morning as i was getting ready just the rumor that god was going to do something it's what stirred these people's hearts to come and you know that's the way it's going to be even greater measure in the end time just the rumor that god may show up and do something outstanding will bring people here and other places where god is meeting with his people i want to say welcome to brother peter and sister sarah this morning i want to say a bigger welcome to peter josiah jr he has a head full of hair i've been seeing pictures of him there's nothing like meeting someone in person if you saw me go out there and worship that's what i was doing because i don't know how busy it will be after the service so i wanted a face-to-face glimpse because i was beginning to think he was going to walk in to his first service here to visit us but i'm so thankful two months he's right right at about two months or ten weeks and we are so thankful to have them here this morning especially junior praise god brother nathan and sister shoshanna are streaming the service this morning and god is strengthening them and helping them and and uh nathan's getting a little more sleep i don't know about sister shoshanna but nathan really needed it too he was looking a little peaked there but he's getting it and he's been taking nice walks uh with with little sister edith and i know they stopped to see sister weems the other day and she's already been to visit me in my office so i feel really really special and i'm so thankful that god has brought them through and we're looking forward to god strengthening them to be back in service with us we know that the lord is able brother greeley wanted me to mention i'm going to preach in a minute uh for longer than a minute but in a minute um brother greeley wanted me to mention that he felt like it was a good idea you can certainly continue to keep doing what you've been doing for the principal offering but he said he felt like it would be a good idea for april if we would funnel any extra funds that came in to the expense of the meetings and not take a specific principle offering this was something that he had in his mind i had not yet thought of that but i have to tell you i was very relieved when he sent the text because we have taken on quite a bit of responsibility and there are some that we're helping out with their hotel rooms because we don't have we don't have enough room in our homes for them i look forward to a day that god brings his total word to pass and we have accommodations right here on the campground i feel it i haven't given up i still feel it sometimes i close my eyes and see them i was talking to my wife about them the other day i believe god's going to give us that i just don't like giving marriott that much money because they are hilton hilton i mean you know hampton or hilton i mean what is the express holiday inn express i don't like giving them that much money i know that god can help us one of these days but until we do that we want to make sure that the needs are met we're able to help these people that will come when the former amish people come we always provide their room because we want to be hospitable to them and i would just only briefly mention that they have been very generous to us toward our principal payment and we thank god for that they are giving people and loving people but it's just in my heart to make that available to them and they always try to be careful how many they bring and i said one van is that all you can get together you know bring two or three you just bring them all of you come that would be wonderful and uh we want to take care of brother miller and his family and uh we're just believing that every need is going to be met austin if you would come back i i hate to take the time to do this but i think it would be a real good idea because the expenses are starting this week if we would ask you to sow into these meetings i think it is actually a spiritual also because we plant a seed and we expect a harvest is that right i'm not going to preach on giving i don't have to because you people are faithful but please please know that brother greeley has asked that we not to receive a special offering next sunday for the principal for the month of april but that we funnel any extra funds that way we try to provide food we try to put hospitality baskets in the rooms we try to go beyond above and beyond to let people know we appreciate them coming to be with us i've been out there on the road and i know what it means to feel welcome and to be made to feel like you're important and they're glad that you're there and that's how we want to make people feel and we we may not be the best at it but i think we do very well in letting people know that we appreciate them here so this would be for any extra expenses that would arise including accommodations and and food and i know you're doing a lot of the cooking but we always have to go and get this or get that or do the other so lord we thank you that you are you know this is just a divine setup lord we've watched it come together it just it's really been unplanned it's been a bit unexpected we were just so blessed when our brother was here that we said hey we want you to come back and and we know if we don't get it on the books it may never happen so we want you to come and we want you to come for saturday and sunday and then brother greeley said why not friday night too and so everything just started coming together and as the rumor got out people begin to say we're coming so lord we just have to believe that you're setting this up you're doing it and we want to honor you for that because we want to live lives that are led by the spirit and we're not worried or fretting over any expense we're just asking you to make a way to provide so that we can be as kind to your people as you would desire for us to be and so we ask that you would bless this back to the believer pressed down shaken together and running over in the wonderful name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen and amen we'll probably do the same next sunday and you can if you're not prepared to help us today you can then would you bring your offering now if you want to send it with one of the children you can do that but i like it when you bring when you come forward we'll just sing another little chorus and let the musicians go down and we'll get to the word thank you lord for your blessings on me there's a roof up above me i have a good place to sleep there's food on my table and shoes on my feet well you gave me your love lord and a fine family i just thank you lord for your blessings on me can i invite you to stand and let's sing that and we'll go to the word there's a roof up above me i have a good place to sleep there's food on my table and shoes on my feet oh you gave me your love lord and a fine family [Music] i just thank you lord for your blessings on me sing one more time there's a roof up above me lord i'm thankful i have a good place to sleep oh there's food on my table and i've got shoes on my feet well you gave me your love lord and a fine family so i just thank you lord for your blessings on me thank you to the musicians and all of you who worked so hard for us god bless you turn in your bibles to jeremiah chapter 31 down just a tad in the monitor for the

god bless you out in god bless you in tucson brother and sister hall and so many others i'm not able to get to all the comments but we thank you for being a part of our service remotely and we pray that god will bless you there i wish i don't know why i can't i don't know why it won't let me get to all of those comments because i don't want to leave anybody out but anyway listening in the uk god bless you sister elitist cousin sharon is watching we appreciate that and so many others god bless you jeremiah 31 3 the lord hath appeared of old unto me saying yea i have loved thee with an everlasting love therefore with loving kindness have i drawn thee any good isn't he good to draw us like that again i will build thee and thou shalt be built o virgin of israel thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets and shall go forth in the dances of them that make mary i want you to put a finger there just a moment and listen to me this is a prophecy concerning a final restoration there are many people who say that the order of worship changed if you'll just look this way a moment they say that the order of worship changed from the old testament to the new and they say that that's why we don't read any instruments in the new testament and we don't read of dancing and some of the expressions of davidic praise in the new testament they say that's because the order of worship changed between the old testament and the new testament and i totally reject that i do not believe that that's god's plan at all what i understand is that there were there was very little need for reinforcing and rehashing you might say the way that people worshipped in the new testament because it was established already the jewish people had an established expression of worship and the gentiles just jumped right in with them and worshipped god the way they worshiped god then there are though you don't have to say man it's truth anyway uh god dealt with the sin problem he didn't deal with the worship problem because worship wasn't a problem amen now the the institutionalized church has decided what worship should look like in 2022 but i just reject that because you can't tell me how to worship my god that's between he and i and the only pattern we have is the bible amen now before i read on i want to say one more thing i know you're standing i can make sure you're listening that way there are those in the message of the hour who acknowledge brother branham as a prophet sent to prepare a bride for jesus christ i acknowledge that i believe that is the truth i believe he had a message thus saith the lord i believe that and i thank god for that but many say then that there has been another change and not only did worship change between old testament and new testament they say that now that the word has come worship is changed again and now we have another form of worship which seems to me to be very dry very dusty sometimes not even heard of just singing there's more to worship than singing so i just want to say to you today you're free to have your own thought you're grown you can think as you like to think but if you're looking to the word of god as an example for worship then you're doing the right thing and to assume that because you don't read something in the new testament that god's done with it is a very dangerous assumption very dangerous assumption it doesn't even work with the laws of theology when we look at god's word doesn't even fit with the continuity of scripture and to assume that because the word has now taken preeminence we should worship less is a dangerous assumption you know if this word has been restored then who is this among us this is the living word and if the living word is in this house we ought to give him all the praise and the glory and the honor that he's worthy of we only have these bodies to do it with so i want you to know that this is a prophecy concerning a time that god is going to restore to the house of israel all that she has lost in the years of her grieving and pain now god's already given her a homeland can the saints say amen and there are those who worship in the homeland but there's going to be a time when the nation will worship god in the way that she has worshiped god in the beginning and that is to be adorned with thy tabrets and shall go forth in the dance in the dances of them that make merry thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of samaria the planters shall plant and shall eat them as common things i have stood in samaria and helped to tend the grapes nathan spent a significant amount of time in the in the uh orchards the uh vineyards of samaria tending the grapevines proving that god is restoring israel one layer at a time i've danced in the vineyards of samaria hallelujah and worship the god who has made these things possible for there shall be a day that the watchman upon the mount ephraim shall cry arise ye and let us go up to zion unto the lord our god for thus saith the lord sing with gladness for jacob and shout among the chief of the nations publishy praise ye and say oh lord save thy people the remnant of israel hallelujah behold i will bring them from the north country he's still doing that today thank you mr putin you're a tyrant but you are fulfilling the word of the lord because the oh because the exiles are still coming home this week a holocaust survivor from ukraine is wheeled off the airplane unable to get down on the ground and kiss the dirt so she asked one of the little boys or girls that was near her sweetheart would you schleck excuse me would you get down and kiss the ground and help me give thanks to god for bringing me out of exile into the land of promise oh yes you're living in that day where god is still gathering together i will bring them from the north country and gather them from the coast of the earth and with them the blind and the lame the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together a great company shall return thither there are many prophecy teachers who believe that the biggest portion of the jews have come home i don't believe that i believe that there are many new generations of jewish people that have had no connection to the homeland that will be coming home in the next months and years and it'll have to be a quick work and only god knows what it will take to drive them there but they must come home the prophet said a jew is not a jew unless he's in the homeland which means he has no right to his ancestral promises until he goes home to claim them you've got to be in the right position to claim the right promise they shall come with weeping and with supplications will i lead them i will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way wherein they shall not stumble for i am a father to israel and ephraim is my first born now we're being told here that when they come they'll come weeping they'll come burdened down with the weight of being driven out of their homes and leaving everything behind but once they get there oh i will build thee verse 4 and thou shalt be built o virgin of israel thou shall again be adorned with thy tabrets and shall go forth in the dances of them that make mary lord we thank you right now that your word is yet being fulfilled it is a continuation even in our day that started when israel was was re-established as a state as a nation for the jewish people in exile we thank you for this why does it matter to the gentiles because it's a vital integral part of what you have purpose to do in the end time both jew and gentile coming together as a new man to claim the full covenant and inheritance of the god of israel how we thank you for that how we thank you for restoring dancing to the heavy feet of the jewish people and lord jesus i want to thank you today for restoring dancing to the heavy feet of your little bride i pray that she will break out of every tradition and custom that has bound her to the place that she cannot worship you with the freedom that david worshipped you with i thank you for establishing holy spirit order instead of man's order we give you glory and honor and praise for it's in the name above every name the name of the lord jesus christ we pray and the saints said amen you may be seated psalms 30. i need your help today psalm 30 11 and 12 thou hast turned for me my morning into dancing thou hast put off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness how many of you are dressed with gladness today you can be you must be you got to be [Music] the hour has come that we have to throw off those heavy bands and those mournful garments and come in to the fullness of the presence of the lord because there's coming an hour when you're token is going to be tested anybody with me i don't hear you your token is going to be tested and you're going to have to prove that you have been with the bridegroom my my my my let me have a little water here i don't have there it is i didn't bring it let me have a little water cause i see that i'm gonna have to dig some ditches [Music] the reason why praise and worship is so important in this late hour in the end time is it ushers us in to that secret place where brother branham said the veil falls behind us you see there was an hour dispensationally that the veil was in front of us and it prevented us from entering in to the full second glory of god we're no longer living in an hour where the veil is locking us out we're living in the hour of the of the rind veil the rended veil the broken veil from top to bottom god was opening up a way for you to come in to the holy of holies and experience a real intimacy and relationship with our messiah bridegroom come on and it is not an option it's not for just the weak minded or the emotional as you like to call us it's for every son [Music] you must come in and become one with messiah we know that this is not a sexual union but god chose the the relationship between a husband and a wife to symbolize the unity the union and the oneness the communion of the bridegroom and the bride did he not it's a bridal paradigm isn't it and so marriage and the intimacy that goes with marriage is used in a very significant and profound way to express his desire the bridegroom's desire to have intimate fellowship with us i preached many years ago because there were those who believed that they would go into that place with brother branham and with brother branham they would meet the lord i'm not talking about in that great day when the bride of every age is gathered with the messenger of that age and we stand in the presence of the lord that day will surely come but many were preaching all kinds of things and they still do today and they were saying that we have no right on our own to come in to that personal intimate private place with the bridegroom unless we're escorted there let me tell you something in the customs of the far east there was a friend of the bridegroom who worked and labored to get everything the bridegroom needed everything the bride needed he acted as a go-between stay with me a moment tending to things that the bride might need and to the bridegroom and he led them together into that tent of intimacy where this vow and relationship would be consummated but i want you to know his work was done i preached this message around the world two's company three's a crowd you're welcome in my living room when you let me know you're coming you're welcome in my kitchen in my dining room but there just ain't nothing for you in my bedroom i'm gonna have to be really sick to even let you in there to pray for me [Music] that is not a family room although there are those times when the family's young and the children are little that mom and daddy's bed becomes the gathering joint but there's a time for the wee ones to go out you can help me you can really help me we're adults we're big folks around here there's a time for the little ones to go out it's time for them to go to bed there is a fellowship and the communion and an intimacy that takes place that the children are not invited to because two's accompany three's a crown now i have been responsible for introducing a few couples and watching god take their relationship to an awesome place in many times i have been a witness to the vows that they make to one another and that gives them a special place in my heart and i i hope and trust that i have a special place in their heart for the little bit of role i played in making sure they met one another to see what god was going to do i'm not much of a matchmaker but in in on occasion i i have done that i have been invited to the wedding why why why come on folks you know where we're going so why don't you come with me they've invited me to the wedding they've invited me to the reception but to this day i've only been invited to one honeymoon other than my own in my whole life and that was a man who was a widower and he was marrying again bob jones and he was nearly 80 years old and he invited us to come along and have fellowship together around the word on his honeymoon there'd be plenty of time for us to fellowship around the word that's the only other time i've ever been invited on anybody else's honeymoon i told jenna i'm coming she said come on i said yeah i think we should we'll be on the other side of the pool just kidding on the other side of the resort and you'll be on that side and we only have we can wave at each other across the water she said well come on you know why she can so readily invite me because she knows i'm not coming there's a time for brotherhood and there's a time to be alone and i want you to know something there is a transition that revelation talks about from bride to wife and the bride doesn't become a wife at a big reception she doesn't become a wife at the wedding supper she becomes a wife in the nuptial chamber where the marriage is consummated i want you to know that it was required in bible times i've laid this out and you know what i'm talking about it was required in bible times and i know it's a little sticky and plain but but this is the way we work we don't have children's church so i'll be careful how i say things but in case a man should grow tired of his wife and decide i'm going to put her away and take another say for instance use the only biblical excuse of saying she was not a virgin when i married her and now i want to take up my legal right give her a bill of divorcement and take on another wife this could happen randomly in the in the house of israel and so a law was established not by moses a law was established by god the token of her purity the token of her virginity king james calls it the bed sheet of her intimacy listen was preserved and in fact it was tradition that it would be handed off to the father of the bride he would take this sheet read it if i hadn't already laid it out for you multiple times through the years with scripture i wouldn't i wouldn't condense it this morning but it's there you can get it she would hand that off it is said in tradition that the father would come and that this this token of her purity would be handed out and folded up and preserved and this happened for generations generations in fact i stood as i've told you before in the museum in in uh jerusalem the israeli museum and i visited some of the judaica of old from the different nations of of the disbursing of the jews and i've seen their different traditions in in yemen and iran and iraq and other places where the jews were scattered and in in yemen the jews would make a very elaborate tapestry bag very heavily embroidered and decorated and a beautiful piece of judaica and in that bag would be the proof that this girl was a virgin when she knew her husband for the first time the father of the bride would tuck that away so that if there ever came a time anybody listening if there ever came a time that this young man should just bring any random accusation against this wife and say of her she was not pure she lied to me she deceived me and so i'm going to exercise my legal right under the law of moses to put her away and marry another whoo not so says the father of the bride he would go dig in the trunk he would find the bag that contained the scripture says the tolkiens of her virginity this was proof that she was with her bridegroom as a virgin this was proof oh i'm preaching anyhow i wish somebody would listen this was proof that they didn't hold hands all night i'm gonna have to do some biology teaching here i see they didn't just sit and stare at each other all night rub each other's hand come on we're grown we're big and let me tell you something if you've got a problem with what i'm saying and you your children down in front of the idiot box where you have no control over what they see don't you come and say i was too x-rated in a message like this you've got to be kidding me [Music] i'm being very careful i'm being careful because i want you to know that all the hooping and the hollering and the jumping and the dancing is for a reason it brings us into a atmosphere that leads to worship these things are praise and we praise until the presence of the lord is ushered in then we begin to worship him in spirit and in truth and it is a more intimate and closer communion where sometimes in worship you don't even move you don't raise your voice you might you don't have that right if you didn't praise your way in because the bible tells us how we go in we go in praising him we enter into his courts with praise and thanksgiving that's how you get in if you try to get in any other way you're illegal you've got to go in with praise but when the shekinah or the kavod the heavy glory of the lord begins to fall as he desires to fall among us then i tell you it just soothes everything in most cases i've seen some boisterous worship i have i have but in most cases it just brings everything down to another level the kind of worship i'm talking about is rarely takes place on a sunday morning or a tuesday night the kind of worship i'm talking about is your worship your daily encounter with jesus christ i'm talking about a day-to-day relationship with him i'm not just talking about doing it because everybody else is doing it i'm talking about getting up on a monday and worse praising him somebody said i go to go to work praise him all the way. come on i gotta comb my hair praise him while you're combing your hair when you get home in the evening instead of sitting down in front of youtube catching up with your latest episode of your favorite sitcom i know you wouldn't do it on tv but you know i'm talking about hulu and peacock and i'm trying to think uh netflix and you can pick and choose but instead of doing that as a habit and always sitting around it to eat your meals make up your mind i'm going to spend just one hour because if you can't last an hour god understands you but you can practice your way that's right it's a discipline it's an exercise prayer the same way you get down to pray you think while you're walking around you think you've got so many needs you'll never get them all prayed out you get down to pray and you run out in ten minutes so what do you do you make you a list you find ways to discipline your life so that you spend more time excuse me so that you spend more time in prayer i believe praise and worship is the same way i don't believe that most intimacy with christ takes place in the church house i believe that most real relationship with him that that happens on the other side of the veil is in your private life and i encourage every one of you to get rid of things that you need to get rid of to make more time or discipline yourself if that's how you need to do it so that you can make more time i'm telling you it'll make all the difference in the world it's in that realm of intimacy that revelation begins to flow your identity begins to change and you begin to realize you're not just engaged to the bridegroom but he has claimed you as his own and he desires to know you as no one has ever known you because your heart responds by desiring to know him in a way that you've never known him is anybody all right you see there's coming an hour that we're not going to be able to fake it till we make it there's going to be an hour that we have to go all the way in hallelujah help me my reinforcements are here [Applause] praise god [Applause] i thought you was coming tomorrow hallelujah now watch you get excited i hope you will there's coming an hour that will not be able to fake it till we make it we will have to come out of that secret place with proof with evidence that we have been with the lord you can't lie there with him and come out the same old same old same old same old you can't lay there with him and come out holding on to the things that weary you and worry you outside that bridal chamber you've got to be willing to lay all of that aside and sometimes we can't do it by ourself there's nothing like the ecstasy of knowing that you belong fully to him now i don't know i think i've got a little courage now to be a little more plain so i'll go ahead and finish this inside that place there's no hiding you know uh td jakes years ago wrote a book when i had a little bookstore naked and not ashamed i that's hung in my mind i know it sounds kind of plain but it's hung in my mind because you may not believe this or not but i remember i remember 25 years ago when there was no hiding from my wife she was going to know everything there was to know about me she was going to see me as i really am and i was going to see is that too much i wish somebody would shake your head at me like i've gotten vulgar here i was going to know every freckle i was going to know every birthmark on my wife and she was going to know the same of me come on and there comes a moment in that innocency where all that's raging through your head you've gone through the courtship period you've tried to be careful about how you would brush each other or touch each other or move around each other you've tried to wear your best and do your best and be on your best behavior you've tried not to burp you've tried not to chew your food too loudly but the time of pretense and and all that whatever it is it comes to an end it is the same with god you've never been in his real presence until you've gone in and you didn't care that he sees everything there is about you nothing is hidden from his eyes oh but josh here's the good part son he doesn't run us out because he sees a birthmark he doesn't run us out because he sees we're carrying something a little bit heavy struggling with a certain issue he longs to have fellowship communion and intimacy with you the transition between bride to wife doesn't take place in public it takes place in a private chamber brother peter we used to sing this song i don't know if you've ever heard it or not but it actually came to us years ago through circles of people that you're familiar with and i don't know if you ever heard it or not but it said into thy chamber be free holy spirit speak to me gently as i close the door heavenly lover let thy presence cover she kind of unending is all i long for they used to sing that around some of the meetings of of freeman hobart freeman many years ago while on this pathway the wine press grows heavy but it's bringing forth only the best of the wine so i press toward the mark for the prize of high calling to be a part of this beautiful lady the bride into thy chamber be free holy spirit speak to me gently as i close the door heavenly lover let thy presence cover shekinah unending is all i long for it's in that place that all the praise is worth it it's in that place that all of ishmael's mocking becomes worth it when you know listen church when you know that you are fully known and yet fully loved every hitch every limp every hiccup and yet he loves you and longs to have fellowship with you now does the latest movie sound more appealing than that is there anything this world could give us that could cause us to feel in that moment so loved so beloved so valued [Music] so accepted oh jesus nothing brother the joy of that little baby the joy of this little one we held last sunday oh there's nothing like it the sound of those little shoes coming down that hall when ezekiel comes followed by his sister and cousins oh what a joy when i'm holding little ezekiel and he and i'm tired my sciatica i feel some and i i go to hand him off and he doesn't want to go i've literally gone home and taken another advil just to be able to hold him a little while longer there's nothing like that you that have grandchildren of your own i remember all four of our children when they were born the look they depend on you for everything and you love that you do till they get old enough to talk then you'd lock the vigor away brother man to put them back where they come from but it's part of the process oh the look i remember it well 25 years ago this november when i looked down the long aisle of that church in columbus and i saw my beautiful bride in that beautiful wedding gown that i had seen in a vision the very same gown that god had showed me in the spirit and i saw her standing there not even a hundred pounds beauty that had nothing to do with her beauty she needed to eat i took care of that in a hurry we had onion rings on our honeymoon and i said you're gonna have to meet up a little i'm going to get some more meat on your bones we're going to look like the odd couple forever if we don't and it took my breath i wish that i could have frozen that moment in time i can watch it on the video and feel a little of it but nothing can can really bring that back as powerful as it was in that moment every feeling every feeling cutting the cord for my boys standing over them on the eighth day and seeing them circumcised these were moments in our life benjamin was the firstborn and we redeemed him with silver coins we did it just like it was done in the bible as the firstborn these moments of our lives that we we treasure but there is nothing no feeling no emotion no memory nothing can compare with the ecstasy of the moment in knowing that he knows every rotten thing about me and yet he desires to take me as his bride and transition me from bride to wife it's more than an engagement it's more than an espousal there was an exception to the tokens of virginity in the bible if a husband knew by confession as long as he was not a priest who ministered before the lord if that woman should come to him and confess to him her condition in a moment of passion i gave away what is yours i gave away my purity i gave away my virginity and i am unclean and you have every right to seek another i have to tell you now and i want to tell you something i pray nobody is faced with a decision like this but i'm telling you right now as god's children as true believers of this message you young ladies must must be honest you must be honest to that young man you young men must be honest you're not sitting in a in a mankind woman can't church this morning so you need to know the whole plan you need to also be honest you need to let her know if she loves you less she didn't love you if you love her less you didn't love her you better lay out your life you better know your call you better know what you're what you're here for but if that young man should say darling with all i'm sorry you're not a darling darling with all my heart it breaks my heart to know it doesn't make me feel good to know that someone else has had their way with you that's too plain i'm sorry but i love you like adam loved ever you know you get real i know i'm not screaming i hope you hear me you look real careful the hebrew language and you will wonder if it really means what it says because it teaches us in hebrew while adam stood by and the hebrew is so powerful it looks like he saw the whole thing fear i don't know what kept him from chopping that beast head off i don't know but if you look at the original language in fact certain sects of judaism believe original sin the way you and i believe and they will tell you that from the hebrew it appears that adam hid his face in blush but he was well aware of what was taking place and yet he loved her oh yeah but you say he tried to throw her under the bus you would have too in the presence of that almighty god you'd have heard his voice and you to blame the woman too don't get mad at him because the bible said he made a choice we understand through the new testament that adam was not deceived but eve was the one deceived therefore the guilt of that transgression hung on her and instead of adam driving her away and doing like message folks today i'll find me another one when amen too loud they may hear you your mind i accept my responsibility in all of this and you are mine and i love you and i want you to be mine and the bible said adam knew his wife eve he didn't reject her his dirty trash he took her in as husband and oh there came another adam one day is anybody here there came another adam one day that knew everything there was to know about you knew everything there was to know about me and yet he said i want you your mind my grace my blood my love is sufficient so you can't tell me that intimacy is not a biblical paradigm for a relationship he could have chosen all kinds of paradigms but he chose the bridal paradigm and he chose to parallel it with the sonship adoption paradigm so that we could all get the whole picture here and what i i this none of this is in my notes i had no idea of going toward the tokens of virginity this morning but i will tell you this we can only fake it so long we're coming to such a critical hour that we will have to be able to display the token it has to be so that when the death angel passes by he knows those just give you what the scripture said you see the bible talks about the marking angels of the last days who come and mark those who are sighing and crying for the abomination that takes place in the land and they're sighing and crying for the coming of messiah for the coming of sweet deliverance and they are marked to be protected by god in perilous times you hear brother branham saying this is not a picnic this is not a playground this is a battlefield and we've got to stand up quit ye like men and fight this good fight [Applause] i just wanted to give you this not knowing i was going to because i don't want you to think that i am so uh elementary that i think everything is about praise or everything is about noise or everything is about manifestation in fact i think all things are about balance i think the hardest thing that any man ever did was keep his head above the fanaticism that surrounds his message the middle of the road is the most lonely place to walk brother branham said to my friend brother perry greene whatever you do brother perry keep your balance he didn't say in the quotes he said keep your balance in the scriptures what did brother branham tell us you take everything don't just take my word for it did he really say those words he absolutely did don't just take my word for it you take it right back to the word well everybody says it fits how do you know if you don't ever crack the black back book how do you know if it lines up or not a friend of mine lost his old aged dad 87 years old this week and he said the greatest legacy that my father left me was the fact that he has documentation from his own family and friends that he read the bible 67 times all the way through you don't think that means something it means something we've got a modern church that don't want to read the bible the only scriptures they get is twice or three times a week when they come to church or a verse or two on an app somewhere but they don't pour themselves into that word knowing it's the only thing that can transform us and here's an old man that doesn't even know the power of pentecost like you and i but dedicated his life as a young man to read the bible through and did it 67 out of his 87 years 67 times out of his 87 years what a legacy to leave your children because that was always coming out of him his son said every time he opened his mouth it was coming out of him he possibly of course he couldn't remember at all but things would come and situations would come and he'd say i was reading that here let me show you here let me take you back to what the word said how many of you know we're going to have to have some of that in this hour so please understand i believe in praise i believe in lifting your voice i believe in running the aisle i believe in dancing i believe in shouting i believe in rejoicing i do not believe the order has changed for biblical worship [Applause] i don't i don't i believe if david said shout unto the lord i ought to be shouting unto the lord it's god's sacred word i believe that the bible said praise the lord in the dance i ought to get off of my pride if a fat man can dance you skinny men ought to be able to somebody said well i'm just not made to be like that well i want you to know something brother branham didn't think he was either i read you two quotes didn't i i got one more for you to go back to dancing for just a moment we're gonna close but we're gonna be all around the world before we get there it's 111. i only have three more hours so i got to hurry here right hallelujah let me see where i want to go give me a moment pardon 1963. 10 28 tucson paragraph 68. i like this kind of singing when i was back there praying for some of the people a few moments ago that had been brought in and this not being a prayer service just to speak i was in there and i could hear the songs this was october october remember i'm standing there put your finger there remember i'm standing there in louisville kentucky and brother michael who is the organ player at brother yancey's church at the time he's passed away now or the piano player at brother yancey's church he would sneak over to see us on occasion and he was a radio dj we're in louisville kentucky and we don't know uh too many there but i knew some of the old singers so much that some of the message people there would follow me around because they would want to be there when i got spoken to and i remember one time standing there and two wee little hands come up to try to cover my eyes and it didn't work too good and i turned around and it was dotty rambo and all those people that knew who dottie rambo was who'd waited on an opportunity to shake her hand they said oh brother shelley why didn't you tell us you knew dotty rambo seemed like it wasn't too long after that that i saw brother michael down on the floor and he said oh brother shelly are you having a good time i said yes it's not my first time i used to go to the quartet convention in nashville but this is my first time in louisville he said i have i have something to tell you i said what's that he said brother billy paul is up there in the about in the in one of the upper levels and he said he has asked me to see if i could find you he wants to meet you and he wants to thank you for the cassettes that you sent as gifts remember the ones i told you about last sunday the holy ghost was set your feet and anson i had just bought an old album i know you've heard it hear it again just bought an old album from the happy goodman family down on the floor and it was in a clear bag and i grabbed my mother and i said let's go with this is our chance to meet brother billy paul he's here and he wants to say hi and so we went up and we waited out in the wing and brother michael went up through the through the tunnel there and went up and here come brother billy paul and sister lois branham my first time meeting them and he came down and we greeted one another and hugged one another and we started talking about the old singing he looked down in my clear bag and he said oh the happy goodman family and and i just handed it to him i said brother billy paul would you like to have this album he said i wouldn't have any way of playing it but he said i remember that he said they were my daddy's favorite singers i thought about all the message people that used to mock them and say oh there's such showman they put on such a show you see how you can get critical when you don't know what you think you know and then he told me something that blew me away he said in fact two different times they sung for daddy at the branham tabernacle i said they did he said yeah he said i can't remember what tape but he said that that's what he said god forgive me i hope i'm not disrespecting him he looked right at me and he said but that brother shelley has long time been cut off the tape and he winked at me three times but he said if you if you find it he said maybe i could tell you sometimes what table was but he said daddy comes to the you're the pulpit and he said you would think that he was bragging on morris youngren or or or someone else some of the other singers that he loved to hear so well because he comes and he says now that is my kind of gospel singing what we've just heard he said that wasn't brother ungren singing down from his glory that was howard and vestal goodman singing i wouldn't take nothing for my journey now [Music] why are you mentioning that because i know churches it wouldn't even let nobody sing that song in their church today way too peppy way too many words way too much tempo but he liked that [Music] why are you saying that because i think you need to know that because of what i'm fixing to say he said this not being a prayer service just to speak i was in there i could hear the song the clapping of their hands and we wonder and some of them even i seen them run up and down the floor what they call dancing in the spirit oh my we'd better not let the deacons and trustees see that at first time i was a critic of that when i seen the pentecostal people dancing in the spirit and i thought what is this it must be a bunch of nonsense look what the solution was he's not indicating that there's any change of worship from old testament to new testament he's not indicating that there's any change of worship from new testament to the restored word he said what is this it must be a bunch of nonsense then i got to doing what [Music] he didn't wait on a preacher to vindicate it he said i got to read in the bible whoa and i found out are you still here and i found out that when dancing in the spirit the devil copied it counterfeit not a creator he's only a perverter he said the devil copied it and put them out here with rock and roll and stuff but the real genuine dance [Applause] [Music] [Applause] come from god now brother shelly the bible didn't say that miriam felt the spirit he just said she picked up the tambourine and began to dance that's what it said and the spirit fell on her in the spirit of prophecy fellow moses and he began to sing prophetic music over the house of israel didn't he oh hallelujah and miriam led the sisters with the tambourine and brother bannon said back and forth and up and down they went glorifying god and praising god didn't he didn't he say it he said now that's exactly and always a dance was read it victory when david slew goliath and this little ruddy looking boy came dragging the head of this giant into the city the people met him dancing you'd have been gagging you'd have been turning your head a glory but david comes dragging that big old giant's hair head by the locks of his hair his brother branham dramatizing this i like it here he come dragging the head of this giant into the city the people met him dancing why why [Applause] they had the victory glory be to god anybody here when moses crossed the red sea by the power of god took the children of israel on the other side miriam picked up a tambourine all the daughters of israel up and down the bank they went beating the tambourine and that's what he called it if that isn't an old-fashioned pentecostal meaning i never seen one in my life now just just tell me what part of that sounds like to you that brother branham was against a real expression of a genuine experience did i miss something in the reading i'm doing this not only for you but others who might come across this and i realize it becomes fodder for those who want to only mock but i think the truth has to get out i think people need to know that it's all right for people to have victory and if there's ever been an hour where we ought to have some victory it's the hour that we're living in today it must not be for show it's not a boogie woogie competition it's not for you to expose your knees it's to glorify god and demonstrate that somebody still has the victory glory glory i'm hurrying that isn't an old-fashioned pentecostal media i've never seen one in my life the trouble was with me ah i just love it when preachers are transparent and when you've got a word prophet here bringing a restored message a ministry prophesied in scripture and he comes here and is transparent before us i just love this he is confessing to us his own weakness and here is what he said the trouble was with me i didn't have enough victory but when you finally get that victory i'm not going to read it i read it last week but he said when i realized what was going on i found myself right up on the floor dancing with that little girl [Music] [Applause] i don't believe it was a dosey doe no lord i'd love to seen it a baptist prophet god taken him out of his own element a woman preacher leading the tambourine beating he said and there's brother branham right up in the middle of him clapping his hands and dancing i loved have been in that service where he got so lost in the spirit of his message that he climbed up on the pulpit i know people that saw it that were in the media well you believe that if you want to i choose to believe it he got so lost he said when i come to myself i was rolling up my britch's legs it was getting so deep in there climbed up on the pulpit sits down on the pulpit you remember what he said about the pulpit it's the most sacred place in the earth he said if i were you i would sit as close to that pulpit as i possibly could because that's a place that god comes down and meets with man isn't that what he said exactly what he said and the last time i talked to you about seven hours away girls don't y'all be embarrassed you all have known him longer than i have you just gotta love him you know what and this is a brother that's been believing this message a long long time but it reminds me of some of you and i in the olden days when we first heard brother branham say something we'd never heard it before and all of a sudden we heard him say it and that's exactly what we wanted to do because he was a prophet and because we knew that if we would honor what he said we would get the blessing so be careful nothing wrong with that he said i the trouble was with me i didn't have enough victory but when you finally get the victory [Music] and the token of the blood not the chemistry not the chemistry of the the life it's the spirit life it's the zoy life that was in the blood that provides the token for you and i today we can't go back and touch the chemistry of that blood but we carry we're carriers we're carriers of the life that is in that blood he said when you finally get the victory that victory and the token of the blood of jesus christ comes upon you he said i remember david the great psalmist of the bible when he had done something that this great thing he was given saul's daughter and she was kind of a self-starched self-styled so-called that's the king's daughter you're talking about she was message royalty the last service i was in with brother joseph's daughter if you want to talk about message royalty that would be a family that we look up to and respect the last time i was in a service with that granddaughter brother branham we were sitting down in macon georgia listening to a tape and the holy ghost you can believe it or not but the holy ghost was running through that room no no live preacher just listening to a tape but the holy ghost was running through that room and all of a sudden i heard a scream like i hadn't heard since i was a boy in pentecost i'm not going to say what they used to say it sounded like because it might be a bit disrespectful and i wouldn't mean it to be that way but it pierced every cell in my body and brother bobby looked down the road he said that's brother joseph's daughter there getting under the inspiration of the word screaming like i'd never heard or had been many many years since i'd heard anybody respond that way i got confidence in that see it's not just you that can move with the music hallelujah it's got to be more than that you've also got to be movable by the word i know there has to be orders so that everybody can hear but you've got to be able to be moved by the inspiration of the word why because if it's in genuine delivery if it's a god-given gift it comes under the same inspiration by which god spoke it in the beginning and you're sure going to want to respond to that aren't you there's only one true inspiration of the word she was kind of a self-start self-styled so-called believer and the ark had been away from god for a long time the visible presence of god the pillar of fire hanging over this ark the philistines had come in and took it out under saul's reign and one day when david seen the ark coming back to the house of god oh when i was a boy sister sandy in the in the old-fashioned assemblies of god that was before you all knew anything about the assembly of god the old-fashioned way way back and i mean that not just in years i mean in style they used to come in our church to dance they would leave their big starchy churches on on on i won't call the names of the streets they'd leave their big starchy churches to come out to granny's church made out of a hockey talk so they had freedom to do what like they wanted to do and there was one sister that would come with her husband every year from canada to get under the inspiration of those old-fashioned services and she would her husband play the guitar and she'd jump up and she would begin to sing and it's coming hallelujah the ark is coming up the road it's coming hallelujah the ark is coming up the road i do believe without a doubt the ark is coming up the road god's people have a right to shout the ark is coming up the road it's coming hallelujah the ark is coming up the road it's coming hallelujah the ark is coming up the road david danced before the lord he danced with all his might his wife despised him in her heart but the ark is coming up the road back to the quote and the ark had been gone for a long time the philistines had come in and took it out under saul's reign and one day when david seen the ark coming back to the house of god david run out before the ark and he danced before the lord singing the praises of god and i told you last week or so he stripped off all the royal regal heavy robes of of his position he danced before the lord with his inner tunic on leave your clothes on folks he danced before the lord with his inner tunic on what you and i would classify and even in that day it would have been looked at a little bit disrespectful and almost like underwear but he couldn't let those old heavy ecclesiastical robes get weighed him down when he could see that god's word wasn't even about spirit it was about word what was in that ark the tablets the word huh when he saw that the blessing and favor of god was returning to israel and writing in that heart he jumped out in front of it and he began to dance before the lord singing the praises of god and saul's daughter seemed to be very much embarrassed at that man's action her husband her young handsome husband had cut up oh david go david and misbehave himself in her presence um the king's daughter she was more concerned about her reputation than he is and david said so much if you don't like that [Laughter] if you think that was wild i told somebody like brother daniel recently on the phone could have been him i'm going to be very careful what i say i said you remind me of what my granny used to call a stall-fed calf nothing wrong with that when granny talked about it she was bragging when you get under that inspiration and you feel kind of blocked up sometime we do it to ourselves we're not blaming anybody we do it to ourselves we get blocked up and locked up we do it to ourselves how do we get there we do it to ourselves we don't want to be the loudest or something like that we do it to ourselves but granny used to say you go over there and unlock the gate you let that calf get out of that cave you've never seen such kicking up your heels in all your life she said i've seen them leave the ground she said i've seen them jump like beer kicking their front hooves in their back hooves together way up in the air like a dance so bad now if you get the whole paradigm of the whole whole uh analogy of the story they were being done a great favor because they didn't have to go out and look for their food their food was being brought to him every day in the stall of course you know why don't you here's where the other side of the story comes in feeding them getting them ready for that reading her husband her young handsome husband if you don't like that watch this a little while oh my lord i would be so bold god make me so bold you think that was wild you just wait till i get really free and around and around and around the ark he went again you wonder what the prophet thought about it he didn't call it showing off making a scene he said dancing in the spirit and she was embarrassed and god cursed that woman with a curse be careful how you despise somebody else's worship i've said this i always say the banner because it's the one thing i've heard a few people complain about through the years if waving a banner is not your thing find you a thing come on find you one find you something we've done it all we've put the perish all up which symbolizes the bridal chamber we've danced under it in here hadn't we four men holding it up there we've danced around this church we've carried the scroll which represents the whole word although written there are only the first five books of moses and we've danced around with that scroll giving honor to the word maybe that'll be your thing i got a feeling some people don't want a thing very sad everybody don't dance the same everybody don't worship just to like praise just alike i get all of that but here's something brother branham told us don't you sit back there in the seat of the scornful judge somebody else's ring brother branham actually said gone you've blasphemed now that's pretty serious business you leave somebody else's praise to that person thank you brother peter i heard you praise god see i can hear you better in person than on the stream i'm glad you're whoa oh the victory through the blood of jesus christ the token of the resurrection of christ his life lives within his church there is no other way of fellowship under but under that blood our denominations will separate us and one say that's nonsense and one say this that or the other won't they pentecost was wait a minute i got to get close to see the year 10 28 63 that's a long way from march of 63. seals are preached word is open bible has become a new book and here is the prophet still telling us several months later pentecost was our pattern all gathered one mind one accord he said no one will have to say but what or can say but what the church was inaugurated on the day of pentecost which is the commemoration of shavuot the giving of the torah the giving of the law in the wilderness 50 days after the feast of first fruits what a wonderful blessing it is to know he said and the same spirit that came upon them on that day every time without fail in the bible i know you don't know why we're so excited but we don't i can't help it i'm just reliving i told you weeks ago i've been reliving some stuff i've just been reliving some things i've i've been feeling my wheaties and i remembered being a young preacher in the 90s out on the road and meeting opposition at every turn every turn we can't do that we can't do this we can't do the other we can't i came one time one night to a little church packed full of people sitting in there on the outside to raise the windows for the people to hear the preaching and i preached that night right out of the message they are and i said if you people don't quit tinkering around with this message taking it right out of the bible and trying to hang it by itself you're going to have cows eating out of the tops of the trees just like brother branham talked about you're going to get the thing out of order how many of you know when you're putting the puzzle together you got to read watch the picture on the box that's the pattern that's the pattern if you try to put the puzzle together and get one piece out of place you'll have cows eating tree grass out of the tops of trees instead of underneath the trees what is the pattern the bible what is the pattern for worship brother branham said it right here pentecost is our pattern he said every time without fail in the bible when the holy ghost came upon the people you read it you read it how staggering around like drunk men speaking in other tongues aren't you afraid it's going to get wild oh lord we're so far from wild i don't know if i'll live long enough to get us to wild really you mean you think a little bit of loud praise is wild you know what we've done we've left people that come out of baptist and methodist and nothing's we've let them come into this truth and influence the way we worship god [Applause] because many of them never had a pentecostal experience we've put ours under the pew [Music] it sure does show they acted the same way last paragraph let me say this that in the heathen lands where i've had the place the privilege of traveling and seeing blanket natives on the islands and in the hottentots and see them stand there where you have to speak through an interpreter never heard the name of jesus christ in their life but tell them the story and ask them to raise up their hands and receive god they do the same thing you do right here when you receive the holy ghost they've never seen anybody act like pentecostals right but when they get under that hunger and that desperation they hear the preacher say they raise up their hands i've seen them run out of the meeting to get clothes on more clothes i saw more naked women in tanzania than any any country that i've ever been in they were everywhere on the street bare bear up from their waist up just doing their business just conducting their business and we were having meetings and they would come in and they would wrap them up and i never saw one leave i never saw you couldn't try this in america hardly but i never saw one leave or get mad they just said to the to them they'd say friend you are so welcome here can we just wrap this around you because this is a holy place this is a sacred place and and we don't want no distractions here can we and i've never never knew of a fuss i watched some of it going on right and go sit down and then the spirit of god would come and we'd say do you want us to receive christ do you want to come to the full baptism of the holy ghost and i'd see them women raising up their hands holding onto their blanket i've seen god fill them with the holy ghost with nobody to show them how to demonstrate or how to act never been in a pentecostal church and the spirit of god would fall on them and they would dance all over that place worshiping god praising the lord and holding on to that blanket because they understood from that moment on it was a sacred meeting it was a sacrifice don't you forget when you come in here this is a sanctified and anointed place come on now don't you forget it they're watching us they're watching us someone said to me recently in a very loving way do you think we need to put a little curtain up here behind the instruments i know because sometimes it you might be able to see it no that's not the solution the solution is for everybody up here to make sure they've got on a skirt long enough i don't want some drapery up there like like we're some kind of nuts i want you to put a little more material make sure you when you're up here on this platform you are displaying honor and respect for the sacred things of god so that when you dance you are let me tell you something the holy ghost is a gentleman and he's not going to undress you and he's not going to expose you so you make sure well i don't think there's going to be any chance of me getting that excited i would to god just in case get you a little extra you don't ever know you get right under the inspiration and you might get free you might leave here and say i know now what was wrong with me i didn't have enough victory i just didn't have enough victory [Music] tell them the story musicians are coming you know what i was going to preach on something totally different i was going to preach on first samuel 30. come tuesday night maybe i'll get to it i was going to preach on david encouraged himself if anybody had a reason to cry david did brethren he not only lost one wife he'd lost two both wives were ravished and taken captive all of his soldiers 400 went with him i think wasn't in 200 stayed behind so we must have had about 600 at the time i might be wrong on my numbers but remember they came back and everything was burning not a woman in sight not a child in sight everybody gone david's heart was heavy within himself the bible said the people wept until they had no more strength to weep and they folks did like they always do they blame it on the leaders they wanted to stone david it was his fault that the women had been taken captive and david's heart was broken he felt as forsaken and low as he'd ever felt in his life not one friend to encourage him or hold his hand not one friend and it says but david encouraged himself in the lord you have no excuse very few of us have been through what david went through you may think you're david but very few of us have been through what david went through you got your wife don't you you got your children don't you you got a bed to lay in don't you he had it all taken and not only he but everybody he loved and depended on taken everything they had taken but brother skip when there was nobody to encourage david what'd he do how do you think he did it he didn't have a tape to listen to how do you think he got encouraged sister ben he just started remembering all the other times i'm not gonna preach that that was supposed to be my thought for the message but tell them the story and ask them to raise up their hands and receive god they do the same universal thing it's the power of almighty god the display of his token upon his children whether they're black excuse me whether they're red black white or whatever they might be it's the only place that fellowship is given underneath the token it's the only place listen carefully it's the only place that fellowship is given it's underneath the token now we know by the message that both the blood and the spirit represents the token because the spirit was in the blood you've got to have the token on display amen you see we're coming down to the end and you may find out if you all just play a little something soft you may find out as you go along in this last hour when everything's going to be against you i wish talk was here can any of you get this picture up can i email it here here uh charity you just take my phone and and email it to him or [Music] drop box it or i send it what do you call that other thing airdrop or text it brother wilson henry is streaming the service maybe i shouldn't have called his name but he for so long has been identified with those who have had a real experience with god and he may be the first one i ever saw around this message beating a tambourine i think he probably was he was a tambourine beater and uh i love him and marlene love me and he sent me this picture you can't hardly tell but i forgot about this picture i have it somewhere but this is the picture of brother branham sitting on top of the pulpit he hasn't swung his legs over the front yet i don't think but he's climbed up on top of the pulpit you think a man was under inspiration got out of himself you think a man you think a preacher forgot all the advice from dr roy davis when he got up on the pulpit and got so caught oh god i would i would lord that you would so fill your man's servants all over this world i would to god that you would fill me with so much of your holy ghost power that i would forget about all the other things and be able to worship you that way lost oh see he wasn't just one that ran around trees in the wilderness when nobody was there to see he also knew what it meant to get under inspiration in the house anything we can do to blow it up or anything i don't think so but do you see he's climbed up on top his hand is resting on the top of the pulpit with one hand in the air and he has climbed up on top of the pulpit see his leg see his leg over here on this side [Music] why are you showing that because we're always having to take this from so many different angles because so many different kinds of people watch in and we want to minister to all of them and we want them to understand that we're not trying to make this profit anything that it was not but we refuse to accept the fact that he did not believe like we're told oftentimes in getting under the spirit except when he was preaching he believed in worship you answer any of my texts for me while you have it it's 259 here if you want to deal with them and answer them thank you brother hembree how many of you appreciate seeing that i do thank you lord let's stand are you ready to stand god's going to meet us he's going to meet us we're looking forward to this coming weekend we'll be here tuesday night at seven o'clock sister sally duke will be here singing for us and i don't care if she sings the whole service and we just bring a short little word doesn't matter to me we only get to see her here every few years she's just looking for fellowship and we feel mighty blessed that she would have a little fellowship her and brother bobby with us they're wonderful people and she's an anointed singer one time at harmony there was a big discussion going on and i guess there was enough people in that room that i'm not really divulging anything because i'm sure it's been told and it's interesting to hear the different ways that people look at gatherings and some were looking at it like a concert and some are looking at it like a church service and some just use it as an opportunity to get to sing because they don't get to sing in their churches sometime and sister sally it was an open floor discussion i didn't talk about her because she's not here it was an open floor discussion and she stood up and kind of trembling and she said i get to sing all the time she said i get constant invitations to sing for this meeting and that meeting not not just church she's very very active in her community and she sings for community events and nursing homes and she said i sing all the time i get to do concerts all the time she said but i i just couldn't fly all the way out to tucson to just do another concert she said the reason why i come is because i love to worship him and for me it's not a concert at all it's a worship service and as long as that one that's what it's going to be i want to be right in the middle of it how many of you appreciate that she's not just a great singer but she's a worship worship she has a worshiper's heart and she was singing those anointed songs on the on the cassette and the tape and the cd later when our children were born and the midwives would get under that inspiration we'd ended up we ended up giving a music from sister sally and they'd say i wished i could play that in every birth i do because that brings a little methodist girl she said that brings the presence of the lord and when benjamin came into this world he came in and i was speaking in tongues and the little midwife and the nurse said i don't know what you're doing but whatever you're doing you keep doing that because it's working sometimes people don't know what it is but they can see what's happening and they honor and respect it are you going to lead us in some worship here why don't we worship the lord today we're thankful for the word we're thankful for the atmosphere we're thankful for the reinforcements coming in to help us and we just want to give god praise because he's worthy hallelujah praise the lord come on benjamin let's sing to god's glory and worship him everybody that will cast my mind [Music] where jesus bled and died for me i see his wounds [Music] oh [Music] that sounds so good of the lord our god o praise his name forever [Music] we will sing your praise o lord o lord our god oh praise [Music] i will sing your praise o lord o lord [Music] the son of him the angels are is [Music] [Music] [Music] oh praise our name [Music] we will sing your

many of you are glad you can say today not because of you but because of him it is well with my soul it's like we talked about this week it's it it it's it's not the worshiper it's the sacrifice the worshiper is a fallen man broken twisted by the facts of life the the situations and circumstances of life but when i come before him he's interested in my offering my sacrifice and my sacrifice is the spotless lamb of calvary and that's why he receives my praise he receives it because of the offering the offering is holy and pure and perfect come over here let's sing this old hymn see what god wants to do before we go [Music] i love there's one verse in here that i can hardly stay in my skin my sin don't don't get to it first not in part but the whole nailed nailed nail nail my my when

exposed i ask that the spirit of god and his virtue would go to the root of every condition and bring healing and restoration we speak to every twisted and rebellious cell in the name of jesus christ we command you to come back into the perfection that you were created to express we speak to every system of everybody right now and we call you back into alignment in the name of jesus to function as you were created to function for the health and the benefit of the body of christ we thank you lord for what you've done today we thank you for making it a glorious reality that every one of our sins was nailed to the cross we bear them no more we look forward to all that you have for us in the mighty name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen if you've got a little more time brother daniel has something that he wants to share with us this morning and i think that if someone comes and feels that they have something to say i've got time for them to say it if you do if you're in agreement with giving him this opportunity would you just let me know by saying amen all right you want them to go back to their seat or you just position us whatever's comfortable just whatever's comfortable i think i'll see it how many of you know what this is it's a sword some some states it's a sword yeah how many of you know what this is when you walk out that door here in a few minutes you're going to see a 26-foot u-haul with a three-bedroom house stuffed inside of it and a trailer ain't that right baby well she's too busy her and sister stacy are having a moment y'all y'all get comfortable i'm not gonna take but a minute of your time hi brother greeley when you watch this i honor you today man with courage and faithfulness to stand by a man like brother shelly and i apologize that you don't get to witness this in person but i honor you in case you haven't heard we have a testimony my babysitter when i was growing up one of my babysitters i had a lot of them but one of them's coming to the meeting this week and her mama said under brother greeley's daddy and it's special we had can we had connections we didn't even know we had but i'm going to ask you again how many of you know what this is how many of you know what this means i'm laying this sword at this man's feet to do with as he sees fit my sword this is my sword and this right here is my church that's right here's my pastor for those that would ask for those that want to know if i'm subject to anything subject first to god subject to his word and subject to an elder so i lay my sword brother shelly at your feet brother shelley didn't know what god was doing when i come up to him i didn't know what god was doing a few months ago in tucson and i told him i said my brother shelley how the spirit of the lord hangs on you and god gave us a word and there were other things god was dealing with my wife and i want to be careful not to embarrass her today god gave i've been married longer brother stephen has i'm his mentor when it comes to marriage i got i got four grandbabies already but there's a lot that he can mentor me in and that's why i come but this week i don't preach to you as an outsider this week as the meeting start and we got service tuesday night whatever god wants i'm here for church my family bethany would you stand up sweetheart you didn't you come this is my 21 year old daughter bethany hope [Applause] and she is uh she she i asked her a few weeks ago you want to go on the road with mom and dad she she said i don't know and i said you want to go with me to alabama she said yes i said well i'm not [Applause] i'm not coming back so i just want you to know we serve with you this week this is not me doing something and we'll we'll put our tithes in the basket and we'll put our offering to the expense of the meetings this week and i know there's been plans made in things but just the holy spirit yesterday i almost missed it and then i did miss the timing so i'm not going to throw my wife under the bus like adam did his i'm not going to do that i'm going to take responsibility for what i did wrong there and getting late to church and then if i was out of order which i wasn't but if i was it was so good and refreshing and just the right timing i i heard every word this morning so we honor you brother greeley i want you to know how important it is to me that you know how much we love and appreciate you and your service to this body and we come to work with however god sees fit and i told brother shelly if that means sitting on that back row i don't know that the sisters really want me screaming in their ears because i like to amen so if i need to be up here close to the front whatever's comfortable for everybody we'll find a spot for me i think i've even got my own pew in the in the truck don't don't i baby i i mean i'm dead serious i got my own pew we can just we'll get it out this week if anybody's not busy tomorrow until i find a house we're just going to stuff all our stuff in storage and until god shows us the what when where and how so that's what i got i was going to share some more stuff but i think we got meetings coming up and we better save a little bit for that so i love y'all [Music] [Applause] praise god praise the lord you know uh well there's not any dull moments with brother daniel miller's around i'll tell you that right now we were we were expecting them and then we weren't expecting them and then we were and then we weren't so we didn't know for sure if they would be here or not but i thought that he was mighty silent this morning no text no check-ins and i usually get at least one text of service that says i see you i didn't get a text that said i see you so i figured in my mind that he must be somewhere on the way but i want to say that we welcome you in the name of the lord jesus christ and your precious family we need you we need them you know i was talking to someone recently and we've kept this very very because we just didn't know how things were coming and uh it was in my mind to perhaps just wait until i thought we would give him one weekend as a guest as an evangelist and and i thought maybe we would mention this after the meetings but i am totally open i told him on the phone last night he's going to have liberty to minister next weekend in whatever way he sees fit they sing he preaches there's giftings in his life we're not going to put any boundaries or restrictions on him we're just going to come and feast amen and so i i feel like he knew that he had that liberty he asked when he come up here this is he said i feel like this is a time to announce it and so we are delighted and i will as as soon as we can we'll give you bits and pieces of what god is really doing and how it's unfolding but it's god i was telling someone on the phone uh that uh talking to them a little bit about this and uh i said i don't have a fancy theological term to describe what i have felt the lord doing there's only one word it's just crazy you know like jehovah sneaky we got all the biblical terms for him but there's one that's not covered and that's when he sneaks in and does what he's going to do and when i say crazy i'm not talking about god being out of his mind i'm talking about god pulling things together in such a way that only he can receive glory and doing it in such a profound way in a special way in a glorious way and so we have so much to be thankful for and god has spoken many times through the years i'm sending reinforcements i'm sending reinforcements i'm sending reinforcements so we receive them as an answer to the word of the lord and we are looking forward to all that god has not only this weekend but in the coming days ahead god's doing something already it's going to get gooder from here we know that the lord has great things anybody want to say amen let's stand together wow wow wow wow i have through the years had evangelists that come in buses and travel trailers to live in and would use them while they were here and then go but i think this is about the first time i've ever invited somebody to come to preach and they bring everything they own with them when they come now talk about taking somebody at their word and when they get invited i'd say he took me at my word didn't he and uh we just know that god it's god it's god it's just god there's so many things that we don't know how it will all run together but it's going to run together for the glory of god he's moving pieces he's moving pieces on the chessboard he's moving pieces he's moving pieces he's doing something he's taking victory for his name hallelujah he's fulfilling his word you want to praise him another minute holy god holy god holy god holy god holy god how we love you how we love you how we love you how we love you how we love you jesus yes we love you so much lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah lord go with us today and keep us in the center of your
