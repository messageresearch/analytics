[0:00] the whole book is God's written record
[0:04] of his word the word is not a book the
[0:08] word is a person remember John 1 in the
[0:12] beginning was the word the word was with
[0:14] God the Word was God and the word became
[0:18] flesh so the word the Loos is not a book
[0:23] but it's a
[0:24] man it can't even in this hour be a
[0:28] woman because we are are to be the word
[0:31] demonstrated
[0:32] today not in the exact same way that our
[0:36] Lord was he was absolutely transformed
[0:40] into a body that was uh prepared to to
[0:45] be the word to carry the word as both
[0:49] God and Son of God only
[0:52] one two offices that we're mentioning
[0:55] here but we know there was three it was
[0:58] not Papa father who overshadowed Mary
[1:02] the scripture is clear it was the Holy
[1:05] Ghost not a person in himself but a
[1:08] demonstration of the same God here oh
[1:10] Israel the Lord thy God is is one always
[1:13] has been always will be and that Spirit
[1:18] became flesh and that flesh was Jesus
[1:21] Christ powerful and the blood that he
[1:24] shed was not Mary's blood wasn't
[1:26] Joseph's blood it was God's blood
[1:30] blood that God had prepared specifically
[1:33] for the purpose of redemption you see
[1:36] the purpose of that blood was to get
[1:39] God's Life Zoey life on us and not only
[1:43] on us but in US animal life wouldn't do
[1:48] it see the scripture said the life is in
[1:50] the blood so every lamb that died every
[1:53] Ram that died every turtle dove that
[1:55] died released life it released life but
[1:58] it was animal life life and therefore it
[2:01] only had the ability to cover man's
[2:03] transgression but there came a blood
[2:06] don't ever forget the power don't ever
[2:08] forget the authority don't ever forget
[2:11] what the blood has done is doing and
[2:13] will
[2:14] do should it be our emphasis the life
[2:17] that's in that blood should be our
[2:19] emphasis because God creator was looking
[2:22] for a way to get that life on you and
[2:27] ultimately in you so that life came and
[2:30] dwelt among us we beheld his glory that
[2:35] was God being son among us
[2:40] Emmanuel God With Us so the life was
[2:44] once with us but Jesus is leaving and he
[2:47] says something so powerfully important
[2:50] I'm leaving you I'm out of here but
[2:52] there's a part of me that's going to
[2:54] come back that life was over you in the
[2:58] Old Testament with you in the
[3:01] gospels but in the Epistles and the rest
[3:03] of the New Testament it's revealed that
[3:05] that life is now going to be in You by
[3:08] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire
[3:11] it's so much more than an experience
[3:14] it's a transformation it's a translation
[3:17] it's taking the life of God and putting
[3:19] it inside of mortal men and women
[3:24] everything that happened up to that
[3:25] point is a type and Shadow we're no
[3:28] longer living in types and Shadow
[3:29] Shadows we're now living in the reality
[3:32] of every type and in the reality of
[3:35] every shadow because God's own life has
[3:38] come and I pray that as we get the rest
[3:41] of the mud and Gunk and junk dug out of
[3:44] our Lives I pray that it sets us in such
[3:47] an order that we can live as we were
[3:51] created to live dual dimensionally we
[3:54] were created to live as citizens of Two
[3:58] Worlds and Eternal one and one that's
[4:01] locked in
[4:04] time we were created to be able to walk
[4:08] through the natural existence of our
[4:10] life while
[4:12] engaging that other
[4:15] realm so there is a greater portion for
[4:18] the bride of Christ in the last days
[4:21] it's when your name on the check is the
[4:23] same as his name on the check the
[4:26] reality is we don't want our name we're
[4:28] just going to sign it misses Jesus
[4:31] Christ because we're tired of our old
[4:33] identity our new identity is a part of
[4:37] him Hallelujah and and we say Amen we
[4:41] say Amen when the preacher says that but
[4:44] we forget it when the fever comes we
[4:47] forget it when the finances get tight we
[4:49] forget it when our families are shaking
[4:52] with some confusion or chaos but I want
[4:54] you to know something that's when you
[4:56] need to remember who who
[5:00] you
[5:01] are and if I were you and I didn't feel
[5:04] and experience and engage with the
[5:07] presence of the Lord every day of your
[5:09] life I would find out immediately
[5:15] why I wouldn't wait till
[5:17] tomorrow I'd find out today why I can go
[5:20] two or three days without engaging in
[5:23] experiencing the presence of the Lord if
[5:26] that is your life you are living below
[5:28] your privileges as a Son of God in the
[5:31] last Church age
