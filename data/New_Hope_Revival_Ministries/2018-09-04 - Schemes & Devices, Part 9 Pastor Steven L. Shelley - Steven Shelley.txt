========================================
[Music] will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer [Music] is surrendering our mind to the word that's what makes the big difference that's the great mystery right Christ in you the hope a lord I greet you today in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Savior and our Messiah I'm Pastor Steven Shelley of New Hope revival ministries and we're coming to you again today on behalf of the gospel Channel and we're just thrilled for the opportunity that the Lord has given us again today to teach from His Holy Word his word is life to us it is a living entity in our lives and we can have a fresh Living encounter with God's Word on a daily basis we must remember that when we approach the Word of God we approach it in the spirit we approach it prayerfully we we approach it with the desire and the hunger to understand because I believe that the answer to every question in life can be found in the Living Word of God and I don't know about you but I appreciate the opportunity that we have through Christian television to learn more about the things of God and to be equipped to fight the good fight of faith here in what I believe is the end time I want to thank you for your prayer request for having confidence in us and sharing your needs with us and we invite you to continue to contact the ministry and we will spread your petition before the Lord and I believe that God is moving I'm excited about testimonies that have come in that God is answering prayer and you know when you when you get a testimony when you see that God is hearing and moving by a spirit well it encourages you to pray with greater fervency and it anoints your faith faith is like a muscle the more we exercise our faith the stronger it gets and so continue to share with us your requests and we we'll continue to help you carry them to the throne of God and really prayer is a privilege it's a real blessing to be able to cast all of our cares on the Lord knowing that he cares for us well today we're going to teach again in our series on schemes and devices and if you have missed any of our programs in this series we want to invite you to visit the new hope revival ministries page on YouTube we have a channel and you can go there to YouTube and watch any of the episodes on the series schemes and devices as well as other programs that we have produced for the gospel channel there are some clips from our church home some singing and I know you'll be blessed and if you'd like to be notified when we add something to our youtube channel then if you'll just go to the top of that page and and click the subscribe button we're not going to solicit anything from you what that does is it puts you in YouTube's system to be notified when we add any kind of content to that channel and we've actually had some people who have contacted us and said what a blessing to be able to go back because we realize an hour is a long time and you may have responsibilities the phone may ring or the roasts may need to be checked on in the oven and you may miss some of the teaching and so we're just thankful that we have a way to share it with you at any time and and I don't know about you but I have a YouTube app on my phone and there are times when when I want to keep up with what's going on in ministries or I like music I like good gospel music and so I subscribe to several channels myself and when I get an update if I have a moment some time I go right to the YouTube app and I enjoy that and I enjoy sharing it with my family so we invite you to do that also visit our website at revival dot o-r-g I tell you there are a lot of things on the website that would be a blessing to you and materials that you can order that I know would enhance your spiritual journey and we're always working to expand we have some interesting projects that we're working on right now and I'm getting pretty excited to have the opportunity to share them with you in the near future when we ended our last time together in schemes and devices we were speaking a little bit about the helmet of salvation and so I want to take you if you if you'll allow me to do Ephesians chapter 6 again and I'd like to read verses 10 through 18 and I was going to read it in the King James Version but I I think that you're very familiar with the way it reads the words and the way it sounds in the King James so let me read it again if you will in the in the amplified version of the Bible I believe that it will enhance our study today Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10 in conclusion be strong in the Lord be empowered through your union with him draw your strength from him the strength or that strength which his boundless might provides verse 11 put on God's whole armor the armor of a heavy armed soldier which God supplies that's an important key when understanding the armor of the Lord it is weaponry that God provides for us what we have to do is actively utilize what God provides that you may be able Cecily to stand up against all the strategies and the deceits of the devil isn't that what we've been studying for weeks now strategies devices deceits of the devil he's busy our enemy is busy but I want you to know he is limited in his ability to dissuade you to distract you to pull you off your course if we make up our minds to give him less attention to listen less to the lies that he is always whispering to us in the realm of our mind and come continuously continually into agreement with God's Word tell you the enemy becomes more and more limited in his ability to attack you at any place in your life we're putting on that whole armor of God that we may be able successfully to stand up against all the strategies and the deceits of the devil for we are not wrestling with flesh and blood contending only with physical opponents but against the despotisms against the powers against the master spirits who are the world rulers of this present darkness against the spirit forces of wickedness in the heavenly supernatural sphere therefore put on God's complete armor that you may be able to resist and stand your ground on the evil day of danger and having done all the crisis demands to stand firmly in your place and that's why it's important for us to know where we're standing we want to know that when the enemy comes to us he will find nothing in us that agrees with him and then he has no room to work in our lives stand there for hold your ground when you know you're standing on the Rock of Ages when you're standing on the truth of God's Word you know that your position is in Christ it releases to you an authority that is bigger than either one of us can even begin to comprehend I am persuaded that after all these years of studying God's Word I entered into the ministry as a young boy in 1975 I've been following the Lord a long time and yet I realize more and more each day that I am living way below my means as a blood-bought sanctified by the washing of the water of the word and filled with the Holy Ghost believer we have everything we need to stop the enemy in his tracks you know it seems like sometimes when the enemy attacks we scramble and we talk about it more than we do something about it I'm under such heavy oppression I'm under such great attack we are indeed we are but I believe that we have been given power over all the powers of the enemy but again we better know where we're standing if there is any unconfessed sin in your life you may absolutely be weakening your ability to use the weapons that God has provided against your enemy you don't want there to be anything between you and the Lord when you're putting on his armor the armor that he has provided we use this expression sometime it's an old expression from the south from the southern part of the United States you don't want there to be any dead cats on the line you don't want there to be anything between you and the one you're calling on when you call on the name of the Lord you want to know that you have repented of all of your sin you have dealt with all measures of unbelief and you are taking him at his word I have full confidence that God wants to give us the victory because he is indeed the victory he is the victory stam therefore verse 14 hold your ground having tightened the belt of truth around your loins and having put on the breastplate of integrity and of moral rectitude and right standing with God we taught about that the last time we were together and having shod your feet in preparation to face the enemy with the firm footed stability the promptness and the readiness produced by the good news of the gospel of peace lift up over all the covering shield of saving faith upon which you can quench all the flaming missiles of the wicked one I tell you I like the way that is worded and take the helmet of salvation and the sword the spirit wheels which is the Word of God pray at all times on every occasion in every season in the spirit with all manner of Prayer and entreaty to the end keep alert and watch with strong purpose and perseverance interceding in behalf of all the saints God's consecrated people I tell you if that doesn't encourage you I don't know what will he is covering every part of our physical body which we know that on the inside of this physical body is the real man it's the real woman it's the Spirit being that God has created us to be in the beginning but the enemy in order to be able to get to your spirit he wants to attack the body or he wants to attack us in the realm of the soul the mind the will and the emotions that's why it's so important that of course we want to use the shield of faith quenching the fiery darts of the enemy we want to use the sword which is the word of God and we want to pick it up by the Spirit of God to defeat to cut down all of the of the arrows of the attacks of the enemy but it's also very important that we protect the vulnerable part the the control tower of the physical body which is the brain the mind is a part of the soulish realm and so we often because our brain has the capacity to think we often place the mind in conjunction with the brain and so when we put on the helmet of salvation we are protecting something very very important we are protecting the area of thought the area of our mind we as Christian believers have exchanged our minds for the mind of Christ we are putting on the mind of Christ we are taking authority over every stronghold and we are pulling down every imagination every thought that exalts itself against relationship with Jesus Christ and in order to continue in this process we've got to make sure that we have some protection for our thought life and that's where the helmet of salvation comes in it comes in handy we could say it protects the head it protects the mind the thoughts notice Paul says take it take it put it on he doesn't say it comes to us automatically when we wake up every morning that helmet of salvation is automatically placed on our heads he said take it put it on which means you and I have something to do we have to remain vigilant and watchful and on guard with our thought life we have to make sure that we are protecting all of our thoughts with the hope of salvation now I want you to hear that because the Bible tells us in first Thessalonians chapter 5 and verse 8 but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love for an helmet the hope of salvation and so we have in one passage of Scripture put on the helmet of salvation in first Thessalonians we hear the Apostle saying our helmet is the hope of salvation the hope of deliverance now here's something interesting to notice faith brings protection to the heart faith brings protection to the heart how do we know that because Romans 10:10 says for with the heart man believeth you see our faith is in the dimension of believing we are believing it's faith in action when we believe for with the heart man believeth so he's exercising faith from the heart unto righteousness he is believing unto righteousness and then with the mouth confession is made unto salvation in other words what we confess as salvation must originate in the realm of the heart and in the realm of the heart or we could say the mind because biblically the heart is the seat of all emotions and the mind in the realm of the mind is where all of our emotions begin to spring forth from so this scripture says for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation I want you to know your confession it's just as important as what you say you believe if there's any kind of crossing up of what we say with what we believe if we believe one thing and speak another it causes a disconnection and so the only way for our confession to accomplish what the Word of God says it will is to make sure there's nothing crossing up the connection between our heart and what comes out of our mouth it's very interesting to note that faith is a very important part of protecting the heart protecting the emotions protecting the realm of the mind but hope if if viii is what protects the heart hope is what brings protection to the mind and this means we can protect ourselves with hope and not just hope of of a sunny day tomorrow but hope of salvation the hope of salvation you see there's a there's a difference between faith and hope faith operates from the realm of the heart faith protects the heart but Hope brings protection to the mind against certain attacks of the enemy for instance discouragement and depression in Romans chapter 8 verse 28 it says and we know that all things this is a very important verse of scripture because I'm telling you the enemy really likes to discourage us and to depress us with adverse circumstances but if we can reach for this verse of scripture every time with the hope of salvation knowing that God's Word cannot lie we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose now notice Paul doesn't say all things that happen to believers are good because there are some bad things that happened to good people but we know that all things work together for the good that means God is watching out for you and I and we need to remember that all the time by putting on the helmet of salvation in hope we are cultivating a positive attitude we are working toward keeping a positive attitude and you say well now where is that what is how is that connected to the spiritual well I want you to know it's very connected because you're added to it affects the realm of the soul and the realm of the soul can easily affect the realm of the spirit now what we want to do is build ourselves up from the spirit man so that the spirit of truth that lives in our spirit can influence our mind our will and our emotions but if we're not building up the spirit man the soul will then take precedence over the spirit in other words we will live our lives led by the mind by the will by the emotions now emotions are very important part of who we are but we don't want to live emotionally we want to live spiritually we don't want to make decisions based on emotion we want to make decisions based on the spirit of truth that lives in our spirit by the beautiful work of redemption transformation conversion it's true that if we keep putting on the helmet of salvation in hope if we keep putting that on if we keep actively taking the helmet of salvation in hope it protects us from from our mind going to those places of discouragement and depression it also helps to cultivate a positive attitude in our life as we said a moment ago and it is a proven fact that when you think differently you live differently this is a proven fact the Bible even tells us as a man thinketh in his heart so he is and so God has a remedy you know he not only has a remedy for you and I to be able to fight the enemy when he attacks but he also has some solutions in the Word of God to cut the enemy off at the pass and that's what I'd like to see the overcoming believers began to do in this hour is instead of always you know fighting the enemy after his big against us I think we need to begin to recognize who we are through Jesus Christ and stop him before he's even able to put his hand on our body before he's even able to touch our family all wait a minute preacher you know that back that's that's a little little stretching you know you're stretching it a little bit not according to God's Word change begins in the realm of the thought it begins in the realm of the mind how important it is to keep coming back to the helmet of salvation in hope knowing that the Lord Jesus Yeshua which means salvation by the way that he is going to see us through the scripture tells us that the unrenewed mind the mind of carnality is the enemy of God remember the scripture says for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life well another way of saying that is that the carnal or the unrenewed mind is actually the enemy of God it is at enmity with God it's crossed up with God so it's very important when we're fighting the enemy when we're exposing his schemes and devices in our life that we keep putting on the helmet of salvation in hope that we keep coming back to the truth of God's Word shutting down every lie of the enemy you see walking in the hope of salvation is conditional as long as we choose to face life circumstances putting on the helmet of the hope of salvation we can remain strong no matter what our circumstances are but as soon as we allow our thought life to follow our circumstances instead of calling in authority our circumstances to follow our thought which is supposed to be the mind of Christ the Word of God so it works either way you're either going to be led by circumstances and emotions or you're going to be able to manipulate your circumstances by having the right thought process and I'm telling you the right thought process is not found in the New Age it's not found in some kind of yoga or Eastern mysticism the the right thought process is found in taking on the mind of Christ how would he think of this situation what would he have me to do and how do we discover the mind of God the Word of God in its printed form when when we read it in the spirit God is able to use this word to reveal to us what the mind of God is concerning any circumstance of our life any situation that we're faced with there's an answer I believe for of that situation a strategy for that circumstance that can be revealed to us by the Word of God I'm so thankful I am so thankful that we have the Word of God Romans chapter 14 and verse eight says for whether we live we live unto the Lord and whether we die we die unto the Lord whether we live therefore or die we are the Lord's this is a promise that we have if we know that we are the Lord's we're his in death and we're his in life and I happen to believe that it would be the delight of the enemy to cut your life short but I also believe that the will of God for your life is stronger than the ability of the enemy to try to cut your life I believe that when we walk in Union and agreement with God's destiny purposes for our life the enemy can distract us but he cannot destroy us he can get our minds off of the goal with distraction he can dissuade us he can even bring us to a place where we yield a little and stumble but he cannot destroy what God has deposited in us his spirit life and that spirit life will lead us back to the word and remind us that we have in fact authority over every work of the enemy you put on the helmet which is the hope of salvation every time you act upon the knowledge that God is orchestrating events in your life when you are able even in the darkest moment of of a situation when you are able to say wait a minute God hasn't left me I feel like I'm in a prison I feel like that I am in a pit I feel like there is no way out for me but I know that I know that I know that I know that God has not forsaken me when you say that when you believe that and you say that confess that you are absolutely putting on your putting on the helmet of salvation in hope you're not living in denial you're not living in denial that you've got problems that that things going on around you aren't pretty and they're not pleasant but what you're doing is choosing rather to glorify God even in your adverse circumstances Paul and Silas beaten nearly to death in the Roman Jail if anybody had a reason to complain and throw up their hands and give up Paul and Silas but rather they chose at the midnight hour to grab the helmet of salvation in hope and put it down tighten it down on their mind and on their thoughts and the Bible said that at the midnight hour they sang praises to God they glorified the god of salvation and what did he do he set them free he made a way where there was no way blessed be his holy name so it's important to keep confessing and to keep believing that God is in control even when it looks like no one is in control even when it looks like the enemy is in control God is in control it's hard to be negative it's hard to be down in the money Grubbs in the throes of despair when you're reminding yourself God is in control God has never lost a battle he's a god of the battle he has never lost one battle he sits on top of the flood he sits above it all high and lifted up when you keep reminding yourself that God has never been caught off guard he has never been taken by surprise he sees all he knows all and he is in charge and control of our lives if we yield ourselves to him that he can work in us and for us and through us for our good even in bad circumstances good can come out of them when God is sitting in charge when he is on the throne when we instead of taking control of our lives back from God we want to keep surrendering our life to Him sometimes when when the when it looks like the train is gonna wreck we want to take the wheels don't you dare don't you dare take control take charge of your life when things are looking bleak or gloom that is the moment to take your hands off of the wheel yes and let God Drive let him listen it's too late in the hour to be the co-pilot we've got to let God be the pilot and why don't you just throw your leg over and get in the backseat and leave the driving to him and keep confessing with your mouth lord I know that you're going to see me through I can't even figure out how this could ever be good I can't even imagine how this thing could turn around but I know who you are and I know the power that you have and I'm putting on the helmet of salvation in hope I am raising up the shield of faith to quench the fiery darts of the enemy I am preparing my feet with the peace of the gospel of Jesus Christ I'm raising the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God and I'm gonna stand when I get dressed up in this whole armor of God I'm just going to stand in Genesis chapter 50 we read that in the presence of his brothers the same brothers who sold him into slavery Joseph looked them in the eye and said you intended to harm me you meant this for evil for my destruction but God intended it for my good and that's in verse 20 of Genesis 50 you you meant to destroy me you sold me into slavery after having already desert did me in a pit to die you were out to destroy me but God allowed those circumstances because he was going to promote me why don't you serve notice on the enemy today what you have meant devil to take me out God is going to turn it around for my good and instead of being taken out I'm going to be taken over I'm going to overcome these circumstances by keeping my hope my faith my trust anchored in the Lord Jesus Christ you might say preacher you almost sound like you believe what you're saying I believe it with every fiber of my being every cell of who I am says that God is more than able well brother Shelly are you always that positive no sometimes just like you I get distracted by the howling of the enemy by the closing in of the circumstances but I'll tell you what I'm learning as I'm at or in the Lord is that that amount of time that that time of being in the mope that time of being in the you know the valley of discouragement is getting shorter and shorter and shorter in my life I want to give God praise for that it's him and usually it comes as a nudge from him have you ever had the Lord nudge you you ever had the Spirit of the Lord just kind of poke you in the spirit man and you recognized wait a minute I've been sitting here allowing my thoughts to go down the bunny trail of defeat and I don't have to do that because my hope is not in my circumstances my hope is in the Rock of Ages my hope is in the Lord God who is above all the other gods that have been worshipped that have been praised did me see the children of Israel through and you know there were times that they were fighting against him it appeared instead of fighting for them but he led them right through the wilderness anyway providing for their need and gave them the inheritance that he had promised here is Joseph looking at it with the right attitude he's putting on the helmet of salvation and hope and saying wait a minute I can now look back and see that what you meant why should I hold this against you see why should I die a bitter death blaming you for what really became a part of God's promotion for me it didn't feel good at the moment it wasn't good it wasn't good at the moment it was not good to be left to die in a pit it was not good to be drugged up by a rope and sold to a caravan as a slave it wasn't good to end up in Potiphar's prison forgotten either but it was good when God allowed Joseph to be remembered to be brought up out of that prison and once again promoted to the second in control in charge in authority under Pharaoh himself this was the grace of God and remember this had God not positioned Joseph down in Egypt then what in the world would have happened to the children of his father and what would have happened to the nation of Israel because famine was going to strike the land and God was positioning Joseph to a place where he could feed the very ones who would inherit the promised God was taking care of Joseph's family through Joseph and through getting him down into Egypt although the circumstances of him getting there they were Pleasant it wasn't a vacation it wasn't that he stumbled down into Egypt you know enjoying every step of the way no he went there as a slave but praise be to God he left there as the king he left there with authority and he was able to preserve the promise of God given to Abraham Joseph refused to allow bitterness and depression to take root in his life because he knew that if he did he would miss out on God's highest destiny for him maybe you're satisfied to settle for for a second best destiny I'll just live in the permissive will of God but I want you to know I've learned enough about the Lord and about his word and what he can do to promote someone I don't want to live a half a day in anything less than his highest destiny purpose in my life now let me speak to you just a moment on a personal level I'm 50 years old and I realized that if Jesus Terri's the biggest portion of what I can do for him in the natural it seems if you think in the natural is behind me instead of in front of me there are times that the enemy uses that mortality I'm not afraid of death I'm not afraid to lay down and go home to be with the Lord that's not it at all if I had a fear if I had a concern it is I want to make sure that I do everything that God has birthed me brought me to this planet to do for his kingdom sake I've wasted time even in my life of ministry I've spun my wheels I've lived in the permissive will of God do you know what keeps me from falling into a deep place of depression and and realizing that if I'm gonna do anything I better do it now and you know how you can get I'm not the only person there are some people probably watching me today that that you're you're beyond 50 and you're thinking how will I ever have anything to do yet for God and how will I ever be able to accomplish it well I'll tell you what pulls me up out of that place when I feel the enemy trying to take me to a dark place in my thoughts it's knowing what God can do if you understand God's ability to accelerate and multiply if you understand God's ability to get things done in short order I'm telling you which God begins to pour acceleration into a specific purpose that he has in your life he can move you so quickly from one place to the next and he can accomplish all much more than your heart has ever imagined or dreamed that's the God we serve in a short amount of time he can take you from the pit to the prison to the palace in a short amount of time he can take you from the Roman jail and launch you out into a ministry like the Apostle Paul he whipped from from being the greatest enemy of the people of God the church the church love the baby church he was the greatest enemy she had and all of a sudden he began became the biggest proponent he became the biggest ambassador and God took him from a life of of really resentment and hatred because he was really dealing with some some religious stuff and launched him into a ministry and even even the Ministry of Jesus think about how it was so short from the time that he really stepped into the maturity of his office until his death three and a half years what a short amount of time and never before has the world ever been shaken like it was shaken by that span that short span of time somebody said yes but that was Jesus well I don't know if you realize it or not but he's living in me he wants to accomplish much in my life and through my life and the same to you if he can do all that he did in that short period of time he can pour the oil of acceleration over you right now and launch you so quickly into another level or another dimension of his destiny purpose for your life so don't get in those Molly grubs and stay there it's likely that you're gonna face those moments of discouragement it's likely that you're gonna have those feelings from time to time it's gonna look a little hopeless to you that's when you need to pull out the helmet of salvation and hope and pull it right down over your ears if you have to refuse to be defeated by an enemy refuse to listen to his lie and know that even if there's a lot of wasted time in your life that God knows how to do great and mighty things in your future if you just yield yourself to him Joseph was making a decision in Genesis 50 I'm gonna stop looking at things from my perspective and I'm gonna start looking at things from God's perspective all what a shift my what a change that can produce when we make up our mind to start looking at things as God looks at things it's as though Joseph was seeing his life through the hope of salvation he must have put the helmet on now in the New Testament there is I I think it's it's a great tragedy it's always really sort of hurt my feelings there was young man a gifted young man a man whose God's hand were certainly on and he really had some troubles his name was Dimas and the Apostle speaks about him in 2nd Timothy chapter 4 verse 10 and when I was preaching youth meetings for so many years around the world I have preached hundreds of sermons on this verse for demas hath forsaken me having loved this present world I don't know about you but that gets me that really touches me right down here you know I would I would say gut but I don't want to offend anybody way down in here it touches me deeply when I look at that word world present world it's the world that is in Greek a on it it's not it's not talking about the the actual earth it's talking rather about age a present age so the scripture could actually read for DeMuth demas hath forsaken me having loved this present age he fell in love with the spirit of his age o my children of God we can afford to fall in love with the spirit of this evil age that we're living in right now it doesn't say that Dimas got drunk it doesn't say that he stole money it doesn't say that he had an immoral affair it simply says he left this Destiny's purpose to follow the spirit of his present age he immersed himself in the spirit of his age he could no longer walk with Paul because Paul was now walking in the highest order of his destiny purpose in this spirit the Apostle Paul was walking according to God's will for his life here's a young man who was being mentored by the greatest missionary in the history of the church Dimas right alongside of Paul saw a great harvest of souls he must have seen many healings deliverances lives transformed but Dimas was so enamored so captured with the spirit of his age the age that he was living in that he could not go forward he was paralyzed to move forward he couldn't go forward he couldn't push himself further into what God had for his life and so the truth is Dimas sacrificed his fullest destiny purpose to embrace the spirit of his present age I see many in the church embracing the spirit of this age more than reaching forward to embrace Jesus Christ the church wants to be relevant I want you to know there's nothing more relevant than the truth the truth is what makes us relevant it's not our method it's not by compromising with the spirit of the age that we become relevant it's not by borrowing the things of the world that we become relevant I want you to know it's a thin line I believe the Apostle said I became all things to all men that I might win them I believe it's a thin line that the church must walk in this hour I believe that there is certainly room update many of our methods I believe that but we can never compromise our truth by adopting methods that are of the spirit of this present age it's not another rock concert that's going to deliver this generation it's it's an atmosphere that cannot be created by agreeing with the spirit of this present age this atmosphere for transformation can only be created when we stand on the truth of God's Word we gird ourselves with the armor that God has provided for us and we allow his love to love through us without compromise the church has accepted tolerance as her method and she calls it love I want you to know there's a difference between what we tolerate and what we love we must be careful to love the person to love the sinner while standing firmly against the sin it is the spirit of Laodicea that last church age that we read about in the book of the revelation that lukewarm Church that church that was rich increased with Goods and had need of nothing she thought we've got it all where we're drawing the crowd everything looks good but I want you to know the Church of Laodicea had no idea just how blind how miserable how wretched how naked she really was she needed to be clothed with Christ she needed to be dressed in his righteousness she needed to bring her out of the spirit the control of this present age and fall in love with eternity I want you to know as children of God rather than loving the age we live in we need to love the Eternity we need to love the one who is eternal and we need to allow him to mold us and shape us in this hour I want to encourage you today put on the helmet of salvation get yourself some protection for your thought life put on the helmet of salvation in hope remind yourself of Joseph's situation and the choices that he made to believe that God is bigger than the past he's bigger than the circumstances that got me here I'm not going to be bitter I'm going to let the Spirit of the Lord make me better I'm not going to blame everyone around me for the time that I've wasted or the things that I've squandered but I'm gonna put my hope in him and I'm going to believe that he is able to redeem everything that is lost father I thank you today that you are indeed a redeemer hallelujah you are more than able to redeem and to take back what we have squandered and what we might have wasted along the way the years that we might have spent not fully connected to you or the destiny purposes that you had for our life we repent today Lord I repent before you with sincerity of heart for any days that I have wasted along my journey not pushing for the very best that you had for me but accepting what the enemy was trying to do to take me under and I ask you to forgive me Lord for every bit of that and to raise me up with acceleration let my hope be anointed today Lord this is the prayer I not only pray for myself but I pray for every person watching this program today who will put their faith in here with me Lord would you use us for your glory would you lay your hand on us Lord right where you are just put your hand up toward him would you use us today Lord would you see our surrender would you move in our lives Oh God would you speak clearly to us what you would have us to do and then give us the grace to say yes not only with our mouths but lord may we find grace to say yes with our lives and with our obedience we pray right now that every attack of the enemy would be exposed and forted against the children of the Living God I pray for a hunger to be stirred in hearts and lives right now for the word of God I pray for grace to approach your word in spirit and not only in letter I pray Lord for men and women of God for churches for ministries that are reaching out to the lost that they will not compromise the word for numbers but I pray that they will take you at your word that if we stand on the faith of the Apostles and we do it like it was done in the book of Acts that you will add to the church you will add to the ministry daily such as should be saved Lord then the responsibility is on you to draw them we'll tell them the good news we'll live the life in front of them but it's up to you Lord to change them for your glory we ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen our time is gone for today but I hope you'll tune in again next time god bless you we love you bye bye for now [Music] [Applause] you
