========================================

Description:
The Scripture, “Take My yoke upon you” takes on a totally different meaning when we realize that Jesus would never give us that invitation contrary to His Word.  It is imperative that He must first deposit Himself within us, so we can qualify to be equally yoked to Him to stand by His side.
