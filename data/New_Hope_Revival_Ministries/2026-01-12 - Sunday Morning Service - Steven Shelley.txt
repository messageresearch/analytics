But he humbled himself, bowed himself down, came into the earth, and surrendered himself to the cross even to death. But oh, he rose again. The Father hath highly exalted him, and given him a name, that at the name Jesus, every knee should bow and every tongue should confess that he is Lord of all. You are our Lord. We bless you. We bless you. We bless you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Do you have a need today by the lifting of the hand? We will take them to our Lord Jesus. The highly exalted one who paid the price at Calvary. He saw the hand and he sees the need. We received a request for Olivia Ellsworth. She is not well today at home. Let's ask the Lord to give her complete healing in her body. Remember all of the requests that have been put on the app this week. God sees every one of those needs. Particularly, let's remember Michael and Crystalin and their family to the Lord. They sure have been, like a few of the other families, in a real battle for health. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But I I know he's able. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sister Sharon and and her mom both need our prayers this morning. We know that God is more than able. Remember brother Gabriel Toari, Sister Elizabeth Murphy to the Lord that God will intervene concerning her pain. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Paul Drown uh is uh believing God for great manifestation of his miraculous healing power. I'm believing with him with everything that I possibly can. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Sister Audrey, uh, sometimes I fail to mention, I think I probably should mention her every service. She needs healing and and strength in her body and we love her and we miss her and we want to see her her well. &gt;&gt; Uh, remember Josiah to the Lord in prayer today. Remember the lighthouse for Jesus. God knows the need and he knows how to move. uh as only he can. We have fellowship weekend coming up. Let's ask the Lord to move among us in a profound way. I am waiting on uh a piece of information. I hope everybody will hear this. I'm waiting for a piece of information from Jerusalem. It could come any day. And based on that information, it will determine whether I have to leave immediately or not to go. So, there's a possibility that I wouldn't even be here for the fellowship weekend. God sees the situation. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; And he knows how to move. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm ready for the Lord to settle it. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Elelliana Jane came home feeling okay and then within a day was really, really sick. She has been very sick the last few days. Today was doing a little better. Let's ask the Lord to give her a complete healing. I'm glad to have her home sick or well, but it's very hard to see her sick. &gt;&gt; Yes, of course. &gt;&gt; She needs the Lord's help. And remember Jenna, who's I'm sure like all mama's tired, not getting good sleep, but God is able to restore. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; I think it's all of them that I had wrote down. out across the stream. The Lord sees the needs that you have &gt;&gt; and he is well able to meet every one of those needs according to his riches in glory. &gt;&gt; Would you sing this little course with us as we're getting ready to pray today? &gt;&gt; Sweep over my soul. Sweep over my soul. Oh, sweet spirit, sweep over my soul. My rest is complete. While I sit at your feet, sweep over my soul. Brother Daniel, will you come and pray today? Sing again. Sweep over my soul. Sweep over, sweet, &gt;&gt; sweet spirit. Sweep over. I thank you, Lord, for the rest that you give. My rest is complete while I sit. You said all of the struggle, Lord, when we sit at your feet, sweep over my soul. &gt;&gt; Can we pray together this morning? Oh lamb of God, what a privilege it is to return to your feet today. To be able to cast all of our burdens before you, &gt;&gt; knowing, Lord, that there's nothing too difficult for you. &gt;&gt; There's nothing too hard. &gt;&gt; There's no price too great, Lord. There's nothing you can't do. So, we rest in that today. We rest that every struggle, Lord, is complete in you. and that that your purpose will be fulfilled. We're asking for everything that was spoken before you this morning, Lord, and for every unspoken prayer request. May we have the confidence that was written to the the Philippian people, Lord, that you who began a good work will be faithful to complete it. And whatever the outcome, Lord, that we see in this life, all things are working for our good. And you're not going to stop short. You're not going to do something incomplete. You can't do anything halfway. You can't fail today. &gt;&gt; And we rest in you. And we thank you for that sweet spirit. We thank you, Lord, that your word never changes. We thank you that you're transforming us. We thank you, Lord, that the hair is beginning to grow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're in expectation, Lord, of you moving in a mighty way in our lives as we continue to surrender our will, our will, our thoughts, Lord. Anything unlike you, we want it washed away. We want it cleaned away, Lord. We want the groves of our mind to be pure, Lord. We want no dendrite of unholiness. We want no paganism, Lord. We want nothing that would displease you or would cause you to veer away or look at us, Lord, through stern eyes. But we just want your peace and your love. For we know you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. And that your purpose will be fulfilled. So we look to you for these things as we pray in the name of above all names our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We give you praise Lord. You may have your seats today. It is certainly good to see you in the house of the Lord. the Lord healing and strengthening and blessing and bringing the saints back. We are still missing some, but we're glad that the Lord has helped and and given strength to those that have been out. We're very happy to welcome home Brother Eddie and Sister Janet Miller. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Glad that Brother Daniel and Sister Anna are back safely with them. got them moved in. I suspect that all the boxes aren't quite unpacked yet, but uh we're we're glad that they're here and just asking the Lord to strengthen them and help them. We're glad that Benjamin and Jenna and Elelliana are back, although we're missing Jenna and Elelliana today. God is good and faithful in every way. And we're blessed to know that he's looking out after us. He's taking care of us. He is everything that we have need of. And we're blessed to be sitting in the house of the Lord today where we're privileged to hear the fresh word of the Lord. What he has on his mind at this moment. We are here to hear that and let it change us. We don't want it just to go in our ear and become intellectual knowledge. We want it to go into our spirit ears and become a part of who we are that we can become more like him every day. We're going to invite brother Cade to the piano and and uh help us to continue to worship as we're getting ready for the preaching of the word today. I'm going to call on uh brother IAS and brother Aaron Graves. We'll let these brothers come to you today and uh give uh the offering. Uh, can I ask a favor of you as our brothers come to you that you help to pay attention as the bag is passed to you that the that the offering bag can be passed from one end to the other so that the offering is completed and taken and those that want to give can give. Because we're not just giving to give away our money. We're giving to be pleasing to the Lord and to keep covenant with him and to see that the purposes of God are are carried on in the earth in the end time. And when we give our finances to him, we're blessed to know that he is doing his work and that we are a part of that. We're an integral part of what he is doing in the end time. Brother Cade, God bless you as you help us to worship. Lord, we are the ones called by your name. We humble ourselves now as we pray. renouncing every sin in wicked way. We lift our voice, seek your face and say, "Lord, send the rain. Pour out your spirit. Let the fire fall. Healers want it and all fall fresh on me. Lord, send the rain. Pour out your spirit.

Isn't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Somebody tell me, is he wonderful? &gt;&gt; Give Give him another hand clap of praise. I don't know why I don't. He's wonderful. You may be seated this morning. It's a grand privilege to be in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; To have our health, &gt;&gt; to have our strength, &gt;&gt; and and have a desire. &gt;&gt; Uh so many people are lacking in the in the area of desire, &gt;&gt; so I feel blessed this morning that I have a desire to serve the Lord. With everything that I have, I want to serve him. And the longer I serve him, the sweeter he grows. Is that just a song or is there some truth to that? &gt;&gt; There is some truth to that. If you believe that, say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh, I think that will do for the music. I I have enjoyed it and I I think that'll do. Let's give them a great thank you. Luke Yovich, I wonder if I could have you to open those two doors there uh that are closed and prop them open so that I can see right out through there. And I would appreciate that so very much. Uh it is wonderful to know who we are and whose we are. &gt;&gt; Uh it is good to see more of the folks making it back. Sister Megan has had quite a time. She's still partially deaf in one ear, right, right ear, but we know that the Lord can open that up. &gt;&gt; He's more than able. &gt;&gt; Anybody believe he's more than able? &gt;&gt; He is more than able. Uh I'm not going to ask you to stand because it's not my text, but I want to read you uh from the psalm for just a moment. We um for for several years now we have looked at uh the prophetic significance of a psalm for the year. And uh I go all the way back here to about 20 uh let me see 20 16 2010 2009 2008. So we go all the way back to 2008. And in 2008 the psalm was 108. And so the spirit of the Lord quickened that. He made that real. Was spoken by someone who I believe is extremely prophetic. And I said, "Well, Lord, I'm going to I agree with that. There's something in my spirit." Um Luke, we can find there's I'm sorry to just talk out in church like this, but there's one in the back. Take one out of my door or whatever. You all just borrow one. They disappear. Uh, if you ever just happen to look up and see one of those doors stops that belongs to us at your house, would you bring it back? Um, I can only imagine how they leave, but they do. Uh, we've had about six to disappear and I just buy more. But, but you know that uh there's there's a better solution for that. Uh, out of my pocket, I bought a set of silverware for the back. Not not silverware. What do you call it now? Flate wear. Well, it's not flat, but uh I don't like plastic. Um I know that it's the best we can do. Uh hard enough to get things cleaned up after a meal. And and I know that's the best we can do for the sometime for the fellowship, Paul. But I don't like plastic forks and spoons. I don't believe it's God. I don't like paper plates. I use them when I have to, but I don't like paper plates. Um, there are just certain things that don't work well. But I found out if you put a my wife, well, she just got on to me because I would get a real plate and put it under my paper plate. She said, "I was still going to have to wash it." Well, I don't know what to say, honey, but some things you just can't eat good on a paper plate. So, I bought flatwear for the back and people will come in on Tuesday night. These wonderful musicians and I don't want to reflect on them in any negative way, but they uh bring their lunch sometime or the quick supper uh in a little container and they use a flatear and well, didn't take long and I had one fork and one spoon. So, I bought another set and I've already saw that I'm missing a fork and a spoon. And I'm going to just start doing like Bobby Connor and calling it back in the spirit. Bring me my fork. Please, Lord, bring it back. Anyway, you you'd just be surprised the perils of a pastor. The things we go through. You think I just sit around and and do nothing, but I I I I I try to figure these mysteries out sometime. But anyway, moving along. You're you're doing you're you're a little looser than you were. Uh let's go to Psalm 126 because that's where we are. And I think you're going to like it. I like it. &gt;&gt; I like it. Now, I'm I'm going to read real quick here. uh 20:25 uh Psalm 125. Just real quick, it's just five verses. I want you to understand that we're we're not uh changing our method here. We're we're just going in secession. If the Lord said this is the psalm for this year, we didn't go and try to find one we like better for the next year. We just went in in order. But I have watched God 2020. You ought to go back and read that one. I have watched the Lord use various aspects of the Psalm of the year in our life, in our families, in our church. And I just want you to be aware of it because we don't always usually we read it at least once, but we don't always. I I want to read 125 just to show you that again that was that was for the last season. They that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Zion. This is 125. This was 2025. Shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed but abideth forever. How many of you know that you've been taught well that Zion is not just a place, &gt;&gt; it's a people. As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people from henceforth even forever. &gt;&gt; And if you've ever been to Jerusalem and stood with me on the hos prominade looking over the old city, you can you're standing on a on a mountain range, a small mountain range, and you can look all around the the city. the particularly the old city but also the new city would be on your left. Old city would be on your right and a little bit in front of you from the hos prominade or prominade whichever you prefer. That's just a few blocks away from the uh the place where I knelt down several times on an empty city block and prayed in the spirit and called for the embassy of the United States to be moved to that block and it sits there today. &gt;&gt; Thanks be to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And regardless of what you think of our president uh present administration, he is the only one &gt;&gt; uh if he's never remembered for anything else, may he be remembered as being the only one &gt;&gt; who followed through. It wasn't even his promise. &gt;&gt; The promise started many generations, many administrations before his. But he said, "I will renew the promise and I will get it done." And it's done. When you're standing a few blocks from the embassy on the hos prominade, looking out over the city, you can tell that the whole city of Jerusalem is compassed about by mountain ranges. It reminds me of the view of Tucson because Tucson is also surrounded by mountains and sits down in the valley. And so this is a powerful image in my mind as the mountains are round about Jerusalem. So the Lord, I want you to just see him surrounding his people. &gt;&gt; So the Lord is round about his people. &gt;&gt; What a defense we have. &gt;&gt; No wonder the Psalmist said, "I will lift mine eyes unto the hills from whence my help comes." It comes from the Lord. And where is he when he makes such a statement? He's in the holy city looking up around the mountains that surround Jerusalem. So you are surrounded by the one who has strength and power to protect you. And every other mountain may crumble. Every other mountain may fall. Earthquake may finish them all. But but the Lord is saying to us, they that trust in the Lord shall be like Mount Zion, which cannot be removed, can be shaken, but can't be removed. Verse three, for the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous, lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity. So we should not find ourselves lusting after or desiring the lifestyle of the rich and famous &gt;&gt; or the wicked. &gt;&gt; Sometimes that's synonymous. Do good, O Lord, unto those that be good. Isn't that a little odd thing? Because we say the Lord is good to everybody and loves everybody the same. Even though the scripture doesn't teach that, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It's not what the Bible says, but it sounds nice when you're trying to sell uh sell Christianity, but it isn't what the Bible said. Lest the righteous, okay, he said, "Do good, O Lord, unto those that be good." Not do good. Be good. And to them that are upright, finish in their hearts. As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the Lord shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity. Watch this. Look carefully. As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways. Now, this word crooked simply means not straight. Yes, &gt;&gt; this is not uh uh reflecting on uh someone's crooked scheming uh sly character. &gt;&gt; That's not what is being described here. It isn't. It isn't. It simply means as for such as turn aside unto their nonstraight ways. There's a straight way &gt;&gt; and and and it goes straight into eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. uh narrow it is and straight. But then there's another way and it has all kinds of turns and so forth. It is not a straight way. It is a wide way. It is an appealing way. And some will leave the path there on. And it just simply says turn aside unto. &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean that for prolonged periods of time they will walk in that way, but something has caused them to turn to that way. And unto means to be joined to for at least a season. They are joined to a way that is not straight. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Uh listen now. And he said, "As for them, the Lord shall lead them forth, the backslider, the distracted. He shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity. But peace shall be upon Israel." It doesn't just mean natural. We've yet to see that. But spiritual. I don't believe in replacement theology, but I do believe that we've been joined into a covenant. That's what Romans tells us. So, we have been joined unto Israel. And uh so God is saying to us uh prophetically through the year that if we are one who is turned aside unto a way that is not the straight way, temporarily distracted and walk upon it even a short distance, &gt;&gt; we're going to be brought forth with the workers of iniquity. So the Lord is saying to us to walk in a backsliden condition is not good. &gt;&gt; Amen. And remember that's not about what you do. That's about the condition of your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You heard the greatest message on on powerful grace. You see, there is an answer to greasy grace. &gt;&gt; Powerful grace. &gt;&gt; Uh how many of you were here Tuesday night? &gt;&gt; How many of you were not here Tuesday night? Let me see your hand. Almost as many. And how many of you have be honest now I I because there's no no uh you know there's no sack of coal for you if you if you haven't yet. I just want to make a point. Uh how many of you maybe were not here but you streamed the the whole sermon? The whole sermon all of it from start to finish Tuesday night. Well, that's a whole lot less of you. A and and is there anybody in here who went back since Tuesday night to see it in the archive? That's that's a better number. Let me encourage you uh from the bottom of my heart. You don't have to eat the kind of pickles I eat. You don't have to like the kind of cake I like. Uh you don't have to like my tie. There are just things I don't care about. But there are things I care about. And I am strongly urging you even if you heard it, even if you were here to go back and hear it again because it is perfect balance. &gt;&gt; It is not telling anybody you can continue in sin &gt;&gt; and be under grace. That is not what he's preaching. He couldn't preach that from the word. But he's preaching to us the difference between cheap grace &gt;&gt; and costly grace, &gt;&gt; passive grace and active grace, powerful grace. And uh if you want to know where that theme kind of comes from, it comes from the the Bible. Number one. Number two, it comes from the message of the hour. Brother Bam said, "Have you ever met her? &gt;&gt; Do you know her?" &gt;&gt; Her name is Grace. Have you ever met her? He like the writers of old personified the the mystery of grace. He placed it with a person and with a personality because he wanted us to know that she should mean something to us. &gt;&gt; And and you know he he stressed to us that our salvation could come in no other way than through the grace. That's the powerful grace. Hear it. Hear it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hear it, read it, go back to it, beat the devil with it. &gt;&gt; This poor uh brother has been, it's been told on him all over this nation that they don't follow the message and all kinds of lies, just lies. And uh I spoke with him for hours while he was here, multiplied hours. And there was never any suggestion, indication, hint, suspicion. I had none of that that he had left the message. In fact, I think he probably has a better embrace and handle on the message than most people I know. because it's not what they made it. So, you know, boo devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lying on people. At the end of the day, what does it matter if he's going in the way of the other churches or not? That has nothing to do with truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I want you to know that you should go back and hear that. And I want you to know that I found him to be an outstanding man of highest character. I delivered to him a very serious and painful word from the Lord. And I want you to know he took it like a soldier. And may God give him strength. And I I I he's made it home. They had a wonderful stop at the at the ark encounter. Is that what you call it? And then uh I he sent a picture of them pulling in there. Boy, it's a long trip. pulling in their uh garage garage uh for the weekend. Now, let's look at 126. I haven't started preaching yet. When the Lord turned again, this is 2026. Hallelujah. When the Lord turned again, the captivity of Zion, Zion is a people, remember here it says it. And Zion has been in captivity. She's not going to fall. She's a mountain. She's not coming down. She may shake, but the Lord is going to surround her. She cannot be removed, but she can be taken captive. &gt;&gt; When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that &gt;&gt; dream. This is almost like the dispensationalists who are always looking for another dispensation. You can only have so many. All right. Then was our mouth filled with laughter and our tongue &gt;&gt; not with gossip. &gt;&gt; Come on, &gt;&gt; with singing. Then said they among the heathen, the Lord hath done &gt;&gt; great things for them. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The Lord hath done great things for &gt;&gt; us. &gt;&gt; Is that about as personal as it can get? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; I love it. Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the south, where &gt;&gt; they that sow in tears, &gt;&gt; shall reap what? &gt;&gt; Enjoy. &gt;&gt; How? Enjoy. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing. &gt;&gt; Bringing harvest, &gt;&gt; bringing his sheav &gt;&gt; with him. &gt;&gt; He goes forth weeping over the seeds that he bears. Do you understand that's not a seed that you buy at the store and throw out of a basket? That's one that comes out of your innermost being. You're bearing a seed. You're not sewing or scattering one. It's one that is being born from the inside. He that goeth forth and weepeth bearing precious seed also re referencing tears shall doubtless come again. Come back. Return from exile. &gt;&gt; Return from bondage. How? &gt;&gt; With &gt;&gt; rejoiceing. &gt;&gt; That's not a moment of denominational praise. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It's more than that. bringing sheav, bringing harvest, bringing lives changed with us, with them. That's the goodness of the Lord to us, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Let's stand together. I'll hurry the best I know how. Turn again to the book of Judges. Chapter 16. I'm going to glance here because I want to decide where to start. Uh, someone help uh her find a seat. Judges chapter 16 and let us start at 21. It's not my text, but let's just start at verse 21. But the Philistines took him and put out his eyes. I I read this week that it was a violent act of the Philistines. It was something that they did over and over again to prisoners that they took and that it was not a surgical procedure but a violent and painful act. Sometimes leaving the person brain damaged or dead because they're going in with something. Not just fingers, but going in with something. This is terrible. If the enemy is able to to take the the view, the vision, the sight, the foresight, the spiritual sight of the church. She has no idea where she should be, &gt;&gt; what her position should be, where she is, who she's with. She becomes extremely vulnerable to every attack of the enemy. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Put put out gouged out his eyes and brought him down to Gaza and bound him with feathers of no more ropes of flax. No more ribbon rope. This was with feathers of brass. And he did grind in the prison house. And I won't even tell you the implication of what the Philistines would do to their prisoners that had nothing to do with wheat or corn or grain. This was part of the humiliation, but it was much more than this. And he did grind in the prison house. How be it, this is our hope, this is our joy, this is our potential. How be it, the hair of his head began to &gt;&gt; grow again after he was &gt;&gt; shaven. He didn't go from bald to head to seven locks overnight, but it began. Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Deeon their god and to rejoice for they said our god little geon hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand. They're having a praise service &gt;&gt; to a false god. &gt;&gt; Sickening. And when the people saw him, they praised their God, for they said, "Our God hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us." You're right. He did, and he hasn't finished. And he was believed to be the destroyer of the Philistine people. They knew if we don't destroy him, he will surely destroy us. And it came to pass when their hearts were merry that they said, "Call for Samson." The party started before Samson was ever brought out. Call for Samson that he may make us sport. in in uh a better translation it would be that he might perform for us. Now, what kind of performing is Samson able to do? To he, I'll tell you, to stumble, to drop his head, to shuffle, to blindly grope. And the people cheered. He wasn't deaf. He could hear their mocking and their cheers. Uh they were laughing at him like he was a comedian and all he was doing was just trying to get in place. This was the entertainment as he performed for them and the performance was just you know coming as called and they called vers Samson out of the prison house and he made them sport entertainment and they set him between the pillars. Now, we know from archaeology that the temples of Deeon and other gods that the Philistines worshiped were designed such that there were always two main pillars that hold up the entirety of the roof. There are much weaker cross structures to try to hold everything in place. But the entirety of the weight of the roof, which was usually a half roof, was determined. It was strengthened only by two huge pillars with stone bases and normally cedar plank for the post. He is standing between the two pillars whereupon he said unto the lad. Verse what verse is that? 26. And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, suffer me that I may fill the pillars whereupon the house standeth. And listen at this not to alert. Samson knew. The little boy knew that the whole building was held up by those two pillars. Not to alert them. He wants to lean on them. He wants to rest on them. I'm just going to take some load off. I'm going to rest a little by leaning on these pillars. But there was a whole lot more to the story than that. &gt;&gt; Amen. And let's go on one more verse. Now the house was full of men and women, and all the lords of the Philistines were there. And there were upon the roof about 3,000 men and women that beheld while Samson made sport. So, this was a temple that now included a um observation deck, we would call it, to be able to look over. The temple itself would have never held 3,000 men and women, but God knew exactly how to line this up. Yes, he did. And they beheld while Samson made sport. Let's get one more verse. You you you you may be seated. Go ahead. I want you to rest. Forgive me. And Samson called unto the Lord and said, "Oh Lord God, remember me." Didn't we touch that about Thanksgiving time? We did, but we're not done with it. That's why we're back here today. Oh Lord God, remember me. I pray thee. And strengthen me, I pray thee. Only this once, oh God. Brother Brandham always said, "Just once more, Lord, &gt;&gt; that I may be at once, at one time avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes." Should I read on? Yes. &gt;&gt; And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand and of the other with his left hand which was about six feet apart. So he had he had quite a wingspan here to be able to wrap around the pillars. I'm just going to believe what it said. How about you? &gt;&gt; And Samson said, "Let me die with the Philistines." And he bowed himself with all his might. It didn't matter whether he used all of his might or not. He could have not done it. It could not have been accomplished by the strength of any average man, &gt;&gt; but with all of his might. And the house fell upon the lords and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life. Now don't say suicide because that is not what Samson did. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham is clear other times in the message that there is a sacrifice. This these there are many. This was a sacrifice for the cause. &gt;&gt; It was not a premeditated I'm going to take my life and see what happens. The Bible talks about uh thou shalt not kill. That word in Hebrew is not the word for kill. It's the word for murder. &gt;&gt; The scripture looks at suicide like murder. This is not what Samson did. Do you understand that? &gt;&gt; He did kill and in turn himself. He also was killed. But to murder means without a cause. And if there ever was a cause, a man was born for a purpose to begin to deliver the children of Israel out of the hands of the Philistines. We're not living in the Old Testament. We're living in the New Testament. But there's so much we can learn from the Old Testament. So this is not suicide. I don't care how many leading ministers, Baptist ministers, denominational ministers will write long treatises about Samson committing suicide. This was not considered suicide because it was not considered murder. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But he killed. Yes. with the same with the same inspiration that others in the Old Testament killed under the instruction of the Lord. Kill them all. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "How could a loving, gracious, merciful God instruct someone to kill?" Because in in the mind of God, killing and murder is something entirely different. You won't know that unless you look at the &gt;&gt; original language. &gt;&gt; So someone said, "How could we celebrate Samson?" Well, he's very celebrated in Israel and other countries. By the way, one of the biggest statues of Samson is in Krakow, Poland. So he is celebrated in many nations of the world. not as someone who ended his life in defeat, but rather someone who got off course, got off track, and in the very end finished his commission &gt;&gt; to begin the deliverance of the children of Israel. We can understand that in in the in the thought process of grace. We're New Testament thinkers now and we're thinking of a covenant that this would just not be the way things are done. But we have to place ourselves and remember we are just a a small few years away from the dynasty of David when Samson dies. It's only a few small years. In fact, Samson was a contemporary of uh of both uh Eli and Samuel the prophet. So, uh, being Samuel being the prophet who anointed David, Saul first, then David. So, do you see how close their lives were together? And oh my, a dynasty is about to unfold that will become an eternal kingdom. &gt;&gt; For there will be a king who sits upon the throne of David for all eternity. So, we're in a very pivotal time in Bible history when when the Philistines have been given 40 years over the children of Israel. And then God said, "I'm getting ready. I'm getting ready to raise up one who will begin the deliverance." So, this is a a very important period of time. I want you to look with me this morning back to the rejected king for just a moment and then we will move on. Oh yes. Paragraph 82. They wanted this king. And when they got the king, then the enemy began to put the eyes of the people out and they couldn't see where they were going. You understand who the king is, don't you? He's talking about Saul. All right. &gt;&gt; You know this whole sermon is about a rejected king. Who is the rejected king in the sermon? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Almighty God. &gt;&gt; You know his his heart is broken because he is his leadership, his authority as king over this nation that he has brought so far and been so gracious to. Now, they said, "We, you know, it's been nice knowing you, king, but we'd like to have a king, one just like all the other nations." &gt;&gt; And they got it &gt;&gt; just as crooked. &gt;&gt; He ended up being just as crooked, &gt;&gt; just as uh vulnerable to pride, &gt;&gt; just as human and flesh as any other king. &gt;&gt; He said, "Yes, they wanted a king." And when they got the king, then the enemy began to put the eyes of the people out. And then they couldn't see where they were going. That's the first thing the devil does. When he can get a servant of God, he blinds him. He blinds him to the fact that he's lost. He's lost his way. He's got off the north star. &gt;&gt; He's no longer on the absolute &gt;&gt; and he can't see it because he's lost. His eyes are put out. That's right. &gt;&gt; Serious business. &gt;&gt; He couldn't see. That's the first thing the enemy done when they got Samson, another judge. Remember, he judged Israel for 20 years. In fact, he is considered by most Bible scholars the last judge of Israel. He's definitely the last judge in the book of Judges. But there are some scholars who place both uh Eli and Samuel as a judge because of their spiritual authority. But I think we're safe to say that the judges were finished with Samson who judged Israel for 20 years. He didn't judge like the other judges. &gt;&gt; Right? If you if you go back through those 14 men, you'll find they all had a different way, a different call, if you will, of judging Israel. Some were very actively involved in solving disputes. Some were very actively involved in helping to divide the spoil. And yet there was one who came at the end who was very much involved in helping destroy the enemies of Israel. &gt;&gt; Still a judge. Bible said so. 20 years. Come on. &gt;&gt; Never sat on a judge's seat. &gt;&gt; But he was an executor of God's judgment. &gt;&gt; No doubt about it. Are you with me? Yes. &gt;&gt; He goes on, "As soon as the enemy of the Philistines came in upon Israel, let's not forget God did that. &gt;&gt; They put their right eye out so they couldn't see good where they were going." When the enemy comes into a church, &gt;&gt; when the enemy comes into a church, what does he do? He puts their eyes out to the real facts that the Holy Spirit is the one who rules &gt;&gt; and governs the church. &gt;&gt; Oh, discipline is brought by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I wish I could say the words that would make it go home to the right place. See that? It never would leave. Clench it. Clinch in there. God gave the Holy Spirit to rule and govern the church. Hallelujah. He certainly did. The Holy Spirit, God deals with an individual, not with groups. We heard in the third Exodus. I want us to go on for just a moment. Uh I think we did. Faith cometh by hearing. So, let's go to paragraph 49 of Oh Lord, just once more. It must have been a lovely afternoon. Something like we're enjoying today here on the campground. Maybe we maybe we read this one. I don't remember exactly everyone we read because sometimes I I I think, well, that's redundant. I'll grab another one. And so, I didn't go back and mark them all. And I don't even care that I didn't because &gt;&gt; it won't hurt us. Why do you have to read? Because I want you to know what I believe. &gt;&gt; Want to make sure you understand. &gt;&gt; Want to make sure all the faithful folk understand. I want to make sure all the critics understand. I want to make sure that everybody understands. We believe God sent an inspired message to us. And we use that to line up with the word. And when it lines up with the word, we're going to stand on it until we transfer &gt;&gt; from this kingdom to the next. still be standing on truth way over there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Enjoying the day here on this campground here in Hot Springs, Arkansas. Hope that doesn't make anybody sad. And there was a great celebration going on, but very much contrary than what the celebration is today. There was about 3,000 Philistines looking down from the galleries to a strange pair that entered the great arena and highly honored warlords and their fancy jeweled deck ladies was all sitting in position. Almost sounds like a fall meeting or something. And as it was then there was oh something like a mushroom there. the buildings setting upon pillars that went out. Something like maybe a modernistic type of architecture and all these Philistines gathered up there and had placed themselves up for this great event. Brother Brandham tells us, we can't verify it through history, but he tells us there was even sacrifices going on. This is very, very pagan carrying on &gt;&gt; filth. Sexuality and filth was part of the celebration. And they were in that great celebration and all eyes were centered to this middle of the arena. There must have stood up to get a better They must have stood up to get a better look at the event was just about to take place. Sounds like some kind of event, doesn't it? Go to 58. Humiliated he was. Let me double check. Yes, same sermon. Humiliated he was in the midst of the time that he lived. And I see Samson standing there, a symbol of a fallen, morally corrupted nation and a morally fallen corrupted church cuz he both symbolized listen Israel as a nation and the power of God which belongs &gt;&gt; in church &gt;&gt; in the church. &gt;&gt; That's right. So he represents a fallen nation and a fallen church. Sad, isn't it? It was certainly a pathetic sight as we see him stand there after all his bringing out there and this lad leading him. No eyes. If the enemy can only blind your eyes from the real thing of God, you'll walk right over the top of it &gt;&gt; and not know it. &gt;&gt; You hear him? No matter what God does and vindicates it by his scripture and proves it by his power, if your eyes are not open, oh, why can't they hear it? Why can't they believe it? Why can't they see it? Because if your eyes are not open to the things of God, you'll walk right over it as blind as you can be. Can anybody say amen? because you've seen that in your own story, how people just walk right over something that's made so clear and so plain to you. And there he stands. So it must have been a breathtaking time as these drunken soldiers and women with their cocktail glasses in their hands. I I I can hear it echo across the halls. So this is Samson, the mighty man of God, the mighty man of valor, the great warrior, standing in that condition. I'd imagine through those warriors as they stood with their arms around their modern Hollywood sweethearts, their fine tinsel jewelry dingling the members of this great church of Deon. I imagine some of them could remember by the name of Samson. His very name shook them. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; His very name brought fear upon them. For he was anointed of God. And many of them remembered it. Many of them soldiers standing there could remember seeing him standing with a jawbone of a mule in his hand. A thousand dead Philistines laying there. How could it happen when the jawbone of a mule hit one of those helmets practically an inch and a half thick of solid brass while you strike that helmet with the jawbone of a mule? That mule's jaw would fly to thousands of pieces. We read that paragraph when we were uh looking at those verses. Verse uh let's go on then to paragraph 62. They remembered seeing the jawbone in his hand and saying, "Who else wants some of this? Woo! I like it. &gt;&gt; Who else wants some of this? &gt;&gt; He He's He's uh He's stirred, isn't he? He was a man who could speak. He was a man who was anointed of God. God promised to bless him. He was in the strength of Jehovah. &gt;&gt; Oh, no doubt. There's many here can remember back listen when the church stood in that kind of strength but now all broke up all kinds of denominations one fighting the other one the old &gt;&gt; go back please the old all night prayer meetings is not heard of &gt;&gt; no more you don't remember it most of you but when they put the tent up or when they put the brush arbor up they didn't ask what kind of group is this what kind of church is this they just passed down those old country roads and when they saw meetings going on, they wanted to stop and hear what was being said. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But it was shortly thereafter that they began to put, you know, official signs on everything, labels on everything, names on everything. What ended up being, it was a simple way of identifying one group of worshippers from another, but it ended up being blasphemous names. Yes. &gt;&gt; Names that would boast of knowing a God that they didn't know. &gt;&gt; Knowing a power that they had never experienced before. And God was not pleased with it. Anybody here? &gt;&gt; All kinds of denominations. One fighting. The other one, the old allight prayer meetings is not heard of no more. Let's go on. Street meetings absolutely gone. Obsolete. We We've got our structure. We've got the framework. But where is the God of miracles? Frankly, many deny it. Even denying divine healing, many. He said, "Right here in this state, I had a church man with a great church said, "I wanted to get some seats to put here in hot springs at the armory when I was here, me and brother Moore." And a Pentecostal man said, "I wouldn't even let he wouldn't let me have the seats." didn't even want to loan him the chairs. He said, "I wouldn't let anybody sit on my seats that believed in divine healing. &gt;&gt; What kind of not on a log is this?" &gt;&gt; Really, I I'm not even going to loan my seats to someone. &gt;&gt; I understand if you're talking about something, you know, Antichrist doctrine or something. He just believed in divine healing and the man was stingy over his seats. It's I don't know how many 10,000 times worse than that today. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Anybody with me? No doubt about it. &gt;&gt; He said that that's not only here, it's everywhere. What's the matter? Prejudice because of sponsorships and other organizations forgetting that we are God's people by birth, not by what we join. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Give you the right hand of fellowship. What a joke. &gt;&gt; Amen. Samson had forgot that also. I'd remember he said I guess while he was standing there there was some of them remember that night at Gaza how that man could pick up the gates of Gaza lay them up on his shoulders when they tried to fence him in. Woo. You can't f listen. &gt;&gt; You can't fence the anointing of God in. &gt;&gt; No organization can hold it. God saves those who he has. &gt;&gt; Oh, the father. &gt;&gt; Well, they've got to hear the name Brandom. No such thing. They've got to hear the name Jesus. &gt;&gt; Whosoever calleth upon the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Come on. It's what the scripture says. &gt;&gt; Anybody here? &gt;&gt; Paragraph 157. Still in hot springs. Notice as he stood there thinking the warlord's half drunk standing there. I remember that great person. I remember when he I encourage you to hear the whole sermon. &gt;&gt; He's tearing hot springs up. He said, "I remember when he stood with a jawbone of a mule in his hand. I remember when he folded up the gates of God and walked to the top of the hill. I remember all these things. What that lion roared after him, that little bitty fellow, and the spirit come upon him and he just tore the line in two with his hand and there he stands bound by a little kid leading him around." &gt;&gt; Listen, this was not just any ordinary kid. This was a servant boy. Do you know how these servant boys were treated in civilized cultures? Do you know how then they must have been treated in uncivilized cultures? He had no doubt never mind. He was a servant. He didn't even have his own freedom. Think about it. I'll read on in a minute. And our God, that fish god Deegon has won the victory over him. Could you show us that? Did you do you have the does anybody see anything in that that make you want to leave the god you know? They started making his head to look like Zeus because they wanted him to be the supreme of the gods. You know how God handled him. When they took him there before the ark of the covenant, don't you? &gt;&gt; Chopped him in half, threw him on the ground, he had to bow, took his hands off. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God was going to show him who the real God was. Let's go on. And our God, the fish god Deegon has won the victory over him. Paragraph 158. There you are. The world has creeped into the church. Has won the victory. It's undressed our women. It's undressed our women. It's put a desire in the people's heart to stay home &gt;&gt; and watch television &gt;&gt; instead of going to the church &gt;&gt; and the love of the world has creeped in and took our Pentecostal church for a hellbound ride. Oh dear God have mercy. If you can read that and not cringe a little, I don't know what's wrong with you. I cringe because I know the glory and the power of the true genuine Pentecostal move of God. I know what God was accomplishing through a genuine outpouring of his spirit. And to think that just a short time, not even 50 years later, they had already laid their head into Delila's lap, sold out the power, undressed the women. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on, give them a Kennedy haircut &gt;&gt; and moved on. It's &gt;&gt; very, very serious business we're dealing with today. Now, I'm going to another one here once more. Chicago, 1963. There must have been about 3,000 Philistines looking down from the top of the gallery of this great arena when the people entered the arena that afternoon. I want you to make sure you try to get a picture of this because the temple is at one end where a stage it would be like a stage of an amphitheater and then on the other side would be this gallery and above seating. So it was like a amphitheater that was you know kind of placed here at this temple and I could tell you why but it would make you vomit. what they were watching, the filth that they would come to see. No wonder God said, "I'm going to let them handle my people for 40 years, and then I'm going to deal with them like they've never been dealt with. I'm going to put a stop to some of this." There must have been about 3,000 looking down from the top of the gallery, this great arena, when the couple entered the arena that afternoon. Must have been a hot day. All day long, they had been out there. And in that great and this great company on top of this great arena that was built something on the order of an upside down mushroom and the center post in the middle that went out something this way and held the two post holding all the spectators around. Highly polished warlords and every time he says it and they're fine jeweled women. The scripture in the New Testament is clear that a woman should not adorn herself with silver, with gold, &gt;&gt; pearls. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Costly array. &gt;&gt; Amen. Script. &gt;&gt; It's not Old Testament. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; It's New Testament church teaching &gt;&gt; that the church at large has rejected. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. center post, two post holding, highly polished warlords and their finejeweled women all leaned forward at this certain event for they wanted to get a good look at what was taking place. Listen, in almost all likelihood, just let me leave this with you. I don't want to elaborate, but let me leave it. I hope I've somehow painted at least the understanding that this was a place of filth. And uh when they got through with that day, it would have been a filthy thing, ungodly sexual thing. Samson would have been horribly treated, grossly defiled. It would have been more than I would want anyone to even imagine. It was of high necessity that this thing come to an end before before the sun went down. They had preliminaries, all the entertainment. Probably had little monkeys that played little tricks, had different things that they entertained themselves with, you know, probably hot dogs and peanuts and Coca-Cas and whatever else. I was just taking a little liberty, brother. I thought I would. And they had different things that they entertained themselves with, fighting, wrestling, and and maybe dueling to death. I'm glad he didn't read a lot of the commentaries. I'm glad he just left it and many other things that they had been entertained with all day for it was a great day. But now the main event come stay with me. You know how we all wait patiently while the preliminaries are going on and they wait for the main event and that's when everybody sets up and takes notice. Sometimes sometimes so we watch it in our religious services or when we have our singing and our testimonies testimonials and the preaching and so forth. But the main event is see what the Lord is going to do. See what he has gathered us together for. We're all under anticipation to see just what the end is going to be. The main event. It's the It's that way in anything. We always watch for what? &gt;&gt; The main event. And they all raised up to look forward to see what was taking place because the main event &gt;&gt; was being brought to them. &gt;&gt; And what did they see? But a blind man being led by a little boy. Not just any blind man. a champion, their enemy. The halls had echoed all afternoon with drunken revalry. How they passed the whiskey and their high drinks and fine painted up jeweled women and great dignified warlords and all. It was a great celebration. They were celebrating the victory. Oh, how I hate to say this. The victory that the fish god Deeon had got &gt;&gt; over the servant of God. It just goes plumb down to the bottom of me &gt;&gt; to have to say that. But it's truth. Celebrating such a way as a victory over Jehovah's servant. They do it today. &gt;&gt; They celebrate the fall of God's men now &gt;&gt; just like they did in this pagan culture. &gt;&gt; Amen. And if they're not falling, they're lying about them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So nobody seems to know who to have any confidence in. &gt;&gt; Celebrating such a way as this victory over Jehovah servant. What a shameful thing. Drinking, revalry, painted women. If you want to see where brother Random puts his makeupwearing, jeweled church world, he puts him right in there with drinking and partying and carousing. same spirit and the great dignitaries of fires was burning under the fish god and what a celebration it must have been. But the heartbreaking part as thousands of years later we have to think back of such an event as that when the great God of heaven who had purposed in his heart to destroy that nation because they were heathen &gt;&gt; and had sent a man to do the job and here the fish god idol was celebrating a victory over Jehovah's servant. Jehovah what? &gt;&gt; Never lost the servant that he sent to do it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Lost the victory. &gt;&gt; He didn't lose his call, his position, his place, his destiny. He He He lost something though, and it was important. He lost the victory. What a sight. What a shameful thing it was. The lad, the lad led the stumbling blind man across the hall to these big centerpost where on all the upside down where all the great upside down mushroom or umbrella-like set where the people looked down like this from the great palisters palasters run up and held the thing in order laid by stone that could not be reproduced again today. He's giving us quite an understanding of what this looked like. No one could build it like that. But what a great thing it was. Thousands of the celebrity priests who had served an idol with their chest all swelled out and all their ceremonies and rituals over the idol. They had conquered Jehovah. What a great day it was. Drinking, revalry, and carrying on. Did he keep saying it over and over again? Yes. Not only in this sermon, every time he mentions Samson, which I'm beginning to think he may have mentioned him more than any other Bible character as much as most any other Bible character, paragraph after paragraph after paragraph, telling the story. And if you just do a search for Samson, you won't find that. But if you go to the context of the quote, you'll find that he just kept on. It was it was meaningful to him because he felt like he was reliving it. He was seeing it again just 50 years after Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Here comes Jehovah's servant, blind, stumbling, led by a little boy out of this great post to make sport. The main event of entertainment was to make sport out of Jehovah's ordained purpose to destroy the nation. See, you're not just mocking Samson now. &gt;&gt; You're mocking God. &gt;&gt; No wonder Samson was allowed to do what he did. Right. &gt;&gt; And yet the nation had taken the thing that God had placed in to destroy them. And now they had conquered him and was making sport out of him. Their main event at their celebration. Brother Bam said, "Doesn't that just kill you nearly to have to look at that? to think what could. This story never really should had to be told, but it was probably told for our admonition. &gt;&gt; Wrote that way. Humiliated, broken, standing, now defeated, right between the two post that held the building. What a symbol that is of the church of this day. What a symbol it is of a fallen race of people that is sold out into the world. And the very thing they were here, the very thing that we're here. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I better do it again. I apologize for the stumbling. What a symbol that is of the church of this day. What a symbol it is of a fallen race of people that is sold out into the world. And the very thing that we're here to, oh God, &gt;&gt; have mercy. &gt;&gt; We must. &gt;&gt; We must. &gt;&gt; The bride of every age was commissioned to rise above and overcome the spirit of their age. My goodness. How can they say, how can they place us way off in a millennium somewhere? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When the spirit of the age of Leodysia is stronger in this hour than it has ever been in history. &gt;&gt; And it has not only affected the backslid denominational church, it has affected the message churches. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The not heads. Amen. It's &gt;&gt; very sad. &gt;&gt; I can say it and I will say it. And like I said to brother Greley in the office just before coming out, it doesn't make me feel good to say it. &gt;&gt; But the reality is this. The the the movement today doesn't hardly resemble &gt;&gt; the movement I come among Amen. We've got to have this because the Pentecostal church down the road has this. We got to have this banquet. We got to have this festival. We got to have this. We got to do this. We got to do the other cuz we understand that they're all doing it. What is the difference? They ought to hear rejected king again. What is the difference? What do you think the king is doing when he stands out over there and hears them preach more brother Brandon than than him? doing anything. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, &gt;&gt; just looking for more ways that they can Oh, dear God, help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can't change them, but we can change ourselves. &gt;&gt; We can hear the cry. We can get in step. &gt;&gt; We can come back to the word. &gt;&gt; We can come back to living like we say we believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a symbol. What a symbol. Fallen race of people sold out of the world. And the very thing that we're here to to conquer the church sold his morals. So the Bible sold his strength. So s Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even in these ranks. &gt;&gt; Sold our Bible. &gt;&gt; I've got clips. I can show you. I can show you when they say this was the absolute. I've seen it &gt;&gt; until God sent this. I &gt;&gt; If you believe that, I don't even know why you bothered to be here today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz we've never stood for because he didn't preach that. &gt;&gt; That's not what he taught us. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine someone saying we we now have a higher absolute? Well, that goes right against the whole premise of the message absolute. That's right. &gt;&gt; He kept saying things like, "You can only have one." &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, they say, "Yeah, that's right. That's why we know what it is." Well, I can show you so many times. Wouldn't take long or at least 300 times I have documented. I can show you at least that many times where it hasn't risen above the absolute. &gt;&gt; It's a serious thing to make statements like that. Because we're all human. We're all flesh. We can all make mistakes. Sometimes I misspeak and I uh uh I don't see it until I'm home. Well, don't what what good does it do me know when I'm home? Well, you could come the next time and and say you you you know put the wrong name in the story or something. I I could if I remembered, right? &gt;&gt; But I can't always even remember to go back and do that. So, we we give lots of grace. I hope you do &gt;&gt; because there are so many distractions &gt;&gt; that so I I I think about brother Brandham, brother Green telling me that brother Brandham really had this burning on his heart, this message rapture and all the distractions. And finally, Brother Green just started waving money around. He said, "If you'll just leave us alone and just go out and give us a few more minutes." He said, "There's more $100 bills where those come from. We have got to hear what what he has on his heart to say to us." And and we're sorry that we didn't realize we we didn't realize that we were going against the policy and we had to let people come and start clearing the plates and cleaning up while the preacher is still preaching. We we didn't understand. And and so you can hear him stumble because he was a human. &gt;&gt; That's why we have one north star. &gt;&gt; That's why we have one absolute so that we can always come back as our tiepost &gt;&gt; to that. &gt;&gt; You'll never be disappointed. &gt;&gt; You'll never be disappointed. You may find that it could have been translated, you know, to a little more modern English. Yes. And sometimes when they do that, they water down the meaning. Now, &gt;&gt; so you you you got to decide, do you want easier flow or do you want to try to hold to the meaning, the best meaning of something? So, but it's our absolute. &gt;&gt; It's a written record of a living word. We better hold on to it. All right, enough of that. Enough of that. The church sold his moral, sold the Bible, sold his strength, so surrendered its sword. And standing humiliated in the hour when the approaching signs of the coming of Jesus Christ is at hand, when she ought to be washed, not a spot or a wrinkle, standing, oh Jesus, standing to receive her bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Isn't that what it's all about? Yes. What a picture we see here. You're a symbol of moral decay that rest upon the nation. This nation, I'm not going to try to stay with my scriptures too long so I can get through quick. But I could symbolize that with the church, with the nation, with politics, with everything you can put your hands on today. Besides God's Bible, besides God's Bible, morally decayed, human race itself, terrible condition, and they're under the atheist and unbelievers that can point their finger into the face of the church who should have the message for today and asking them, "What does all this mean?" And they listen, the church. And they don't have the answer. They don't have the answer. Why? They did like Samson did. They still hoop. They still holler. But they did like Samson. They've surrendered because if they let the Holy Ghost manifest himself in the gifts of the spirit in a pure way. I don't mean exhortation. There is no in the nine gifts of the spirit. There is not a gift of exhortation. That doesn't mean that you can't be gifted for exhortation. You certainly can, but it's not one of the nine gifts of the spirit and shouldn't be treated as though it was one of the nine gifts of the spirit. They're listed there. Their function is listed there. And if brother Brandham said anything about the gifts of the spirit beyond what Paul said, you would have to go back to what Paul said. He said so. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; He said, "If I preach anything other than what the first church age messenger preached, it's a cursed." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. &gt;&gt; So, you can keep your little quotes. I know. I get them. They've surrendered. Paragraph 51 of Oh Lord, just once more. How much time do I have? I have a little more time. Good. I'm going to use it to read. Well, I didn't come here for reading. Well, if you heard it yourself, &gt;&gt; I'm going to be real clear with you this morning. There are many of us who don't we have we have seven days out of the week and there are many of us who claim that this is what we believe and we don't even hear his voice in the course of of a week. Well, didn't you just say it's Jesus? Sure. Sure it is. It's Jesus for the world. No doubt about it. He came to seek and to save that which was lost. But I'm putting on a I'm trying to put on the overcomer's garment. &gt;&gt; And and the only way to overcome is to know what you've got to overcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and this message, boy, gives me such an outline of what I got to get up above. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 51. Oh Lord, just once more back to hot springs. And now as we sit here this afternoon, let's see if we can with imaginary mind place oursel in that position to look at this scene coming moving out of the center of the arena. Come a little boy holding the hand of a blind man stumbling, staggering along. They had monkey shows, little tricks and so forth. But now has arrived the time for the main event, the thing they'd waited for on so long. The main event of the day, preliminaries were over. halls that echoed all afternoon with drunken rey for they were celebrating the victory. Is it Did we just read those? &gt;&gt; Yeah, we did skip some there, didn't we? Yes. Good. Here's the fill in. We We skipped down to 58. Now we're filling in. Coming uh for I'll get it. For they were celebrating the victory of Deegon, their fish god over the ark and the promise of Jehovah. The reverse. What a disgraceful sight it is. As we can imagine such a thing taking place. The fish god of a heathen nation celebrating the victory over the servants of Jehovah. All because of the failure of the man. Oh dear Lord. &gt;&gt; All because of the failure of the man to carry out the things that he had been ordained to do. And here was a heathen drunken brawling out jeweled women painted faces modern Hollywood celebration bringing the servant of the Lord God bound in shackles for the main event of the afternoon. The lad must have drugg along there stumbling this great mass of human flesh. Both eyes out hair hanging down his back tied and bound to make entertainment for a drunken brawling bunch of unbelievers. He must have stumbled to the post where they were going to make the fun start from. When I think of that, I think about a church that was ordained of God to do something for God and it suffered the enemy to blind its eyes from the word of the living God. I want to read this for those of you who seem to hate the Old Testament and the commandments &gt;&gt; of God and to the task that it was ordained of God to do only to be sport in a hiding place for drunken Here we go again. Painted face, jeweled deck, shortwearing, bobbed hair. Women and men. Oh my. Not just the women's sorryiness. &gt;&gt; Men too. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Showing your ugly knobby knees to the world around you. &gt;&gt; A church that ought to be shining in the power and the strength of the Lord. What a disgrace. How humiliating it must have been for Samson with all of his framework made up that was more than able and it proved God had his strength through his framework and every muscle that he ever had still was in his body. Oh my, everything is in place. The top five are booked for the fall meeting. The menu is determined. Every framework is in place. I scratched his back in the spring. He'll come and scratch mine in the fall. &gt;&gt; An old good old buddy system &gt;&gt; has invaded the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no doubt about it. &gt;&gt; I I don't want to be so critical this morning. I'll be glad to be off of this. But but but here's the reality. Because I listen, you don't have to guess what they're going to preach. &gt;&gt; It's going to be a variation of the same 10 sermons. Year after year after year, you're going to hear the same out of tune singers sing the same songs that do not sometimes even line up with the word. Everything in place. Framework all there. Sunrise service all planned. Every detail, the framework, the muscle still there. But the blessings of the Lord, he was still like Saul, the anointed, the chosen, but the blessings of the Lord had left him. This is serious. We may have all of our framework. We may have our denominational rituals. I just named some of them. We may have our names in the papers and on the ledgers, but I wonder today if the Pentecostal church isn't standing about the same place, its eyes poked out from the word of God. And for the purpose that Jesus died, that we together could fellowship around the word and &gt;&gt; the things of God. Are you still here? &gt;&gt; Good. I'm getting a lot of notes out of the way. Couldn't you just condense them? I tried. 1963, same sermon, same theme once more. New York, New York. I'm telling you, from Hot Springs, Arkansas to Chicago, Illinois to New York, New York. They had no excuse. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was indicting the outcome of Pentecost. Paragraph 59, New York. What a sad sight. Must have been a hot afternoon. Sunshining, great celebration. 3,000 felistings looked down the galleries of the stadium as the pair entered. High honored warlords, finejeweled ladies lean forward to get a good look. And the boy and the boy led this blind man. The halls had echoed all afternoon with drunken revalry, celebrating, here's what hurts me, celebrating the victory of their fish, God day over Jehovah's servant. What a disgrace. What a thing had happened. The man had failed. Not God had not failed. &gt;&gt; And what Jehovah must have been thinking as he looked down and see all this going on. Drunken conglomeration of women half stripped &gt;&gt; and what? &gt;&gt; Finejweled. You know, I should have at least one big diamond. Fine jeweled and decorated and fixed up. their drunken husbands drinking, celebrating to a god, a fish god, an idol that had took the victory over Jehovah's sermon. That's pretty sad. Still in New York 101. But now he stands hopeless. All stripped of power. It's the same thing now. The church stands the same way where once the church used to cast out devils. The church used to raise up the dead. The church used to do the things that Jesus did. Sin. Oh God, help us. &gt;&gt; Somebody say us. &gt;&gt; Help us. Be careful. Sin could not dwell among them. The Holy Spirit came in and condemned it. If a man done something secretly and belonged to this Christian group, as soon as he come in, the Holy Spirit revealed his sin. and he either repented or perished. But you see, we don't have it no more. &gt;&gt; Help us. &gt;&gt; And they won't receive it no more. And when it does come, they try to call it an evil spirit that they might receive that much more condemnation. Something has to condemn them. Notice strip of power. What must have went through the man's mind? Once that kind of a warrior and now a little boy has to lead him around. Why? He's blind. He can't see. He has nothing to see with. The reality is if Samson would have lived another 20 years, he would have still had to depend on somebody. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To lead him around. God have mercy upon us. The church is so denominated and so far away till the devil is poked out the eyesight, the spiritual side. They don't even understand. sitting right here this morning, sitting right in this church, they don't even understand the hour that we're living in. &gt;&gt; They don't understand the vicious cycle that they have refused to break out of. &gt;&gt; That's right. If it's a cycle, it means they're doing the same thing. Still slided. still sly. This is the word of God, not a creed. It's the word and God is duty bound to produce air. Lie. They still lie. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Stop lying. &gt;&gt; Yes. If you find that you are in a cycle of lying and you don't even know why when it's over, you need more than a New Year's resolution. &gt;&gt; You need a mighty deliverance. And the mighty deliverer is available to you if you will call on him. Not a creed. It's the word. And God is duty bound to produce everything that he promised in this Bible. Way we believe. You haven't got no belief coming. If it's contrary to this, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; the mind of Christ in you. You believe the things that Christ wrote because this is Christ the word. But look at the condition. Look at the parallel. When we see that it would be wrong of me to stand here uh 73, 83, 93, 2003, 2013, 2023, 63 years later. And not mentioned that even a remnant who came out because of these messages of truth, many of them have found themselves back in the condition that they were in in the beginning and have never acknowledged it. &gt;&gt; They took the gifts off the floor. They stuffed them in a back room and now they've put them entirely out of the church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I don't mean gifts that just come to say an encouraging word. That's the kind we flock to hear. &gt;&gt; I mean the kind that come and say, "I'm about to send the waters of separation through this house." And you think now you know on which side someone will stand, but you may be surprised. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about that kind of a gift. One that says, "Go ahead. Brace yourself. Prepare yourself because some real times are coming. Ananas, you you'll figure it out. You'll figure it out before it's over. Uh why somebody is stirred up about it. Why somebody's disturbed about it? &gt;&gt; Because we don't want anybody to pack you out of here. &gt;&gt; Is that too rough to say? &gt;&gt; No, sir. Well, it ain't nearly as rough as I said it in the 90s. The mind of Christ and you you got to believe the things Christ wrote cuz but look the parallel. We must have went through his we must have went through his mind. Let's see what went through his mind. We see what went through the Lord's warlord's mind of the fear that they once had of his name. They were scared to do anything. They just mentioned Samson. Everybody was gone because there he was saying, "You want some of this?" But now standing a victim under Deegon, the fish god. Oh, they must have had a big time. A Jew that despised idols was standing a victim under one because he had failed. God Samson standing there. No doubt. Let's search his mind for about three or four minutes. Let's do it. &gt;&gt; You willing? &gt;&gt; Yes, ma'am. He must have thought of all the victories he had. There he stands, what he had done, how the Lord had blessed him. How that he once was a great man as long as he was in the kingdom of God, keeping the promise of God, how he was one of the right-hand men, &gt;&gt; how everything revolved around him. Now notice, he had thought of all his victories and then there must have went through his mind how he had failed God's people. It ought to be a shame to a minister that will sit and read this Bible, then walk out before his people. The world is full of lots. &gt;&gt; The Bible said that the sins of Sodom vexed his righteous soul. &gt;&gt; But he didn't have the courage to stand up and rebuke that sin. And there is many men today in my my absolute favorite punctuation dot dot dot and I say this with reverence only with with love but just to say truth we may never meet again. There's many man that reads this same Bible that we read sits in his office preparing his message and run upon these truths of God and have to bypass them. He would be afraid to preach against the women cutting their hair. His organization would turn him out. That's why the Jacksonites came along with you can cut it as long as you cut it an inch at a time. And now if you take a big look around, there is no hair. I see them. They're dying in New Brunswick like flies because the old-timers are getting older. they're passing away. And they took that doctrine of Raymond Jackson and uh inched it at a time until there was none. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; It started to turn white and they didn't want it to look yellow. So they started blue blue tinting it. So we lived for 15 years with blue-haired women in the message. And now all of a sudden, suddenly after 40 years, it's black again, brown again. It's the oddest looking thing. It's going to be quiet, &gt;&gt; but it's the oddest looking thing to me. all these wrinkles like the like the like the tributaries of the Grand Canyon and and black jet bottled hairdo. You see what happens? I wish wherever whoever has him would send him back and let him tell him, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Leave it be. It's your glory on the top of your head. It's a sign of your submission to your husband. It's a sign of his authority over you and God's authority over the both of you. Leave it alone. &gt;&gt; A message so strong that even the Baptist preached it &gt;&gt; for several hundred years. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Until they couldn't anymore. So, it wasn't that God was not giving it to them. If he ever gave them the sermon in the first place, he must have still been giving it to them, but they couldn't preach it &gt;&gt; because the people wanted to do it. Their wives, somebody go get the delivery. Not you. Not you. There's people in the back. Thank you for being willing. It's a sad thing. They couldn't preach it because their wives wanted to do it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And these silly questions and answers. God, you know, sent a messenger to turn hearts and on and on and on, a message of restoration. And they start asking these silly questions. What about fingernails? Well, I guess if you don't have some, you could put some on. &gt;&gt; Really? Have you ever seen anybody that didn't have any? Not not not average. Not average. I could tell you the funny stories about toenails. But I won't cuz they'll sure rip them off if you keep having trouble. And you you look you look like a funny thing. been. So, I've never seen anybody didn't have any fingernails. I mean, some people bite them down to the quick. So, do you really think the Holy Ghost is leading somebody to go put on plastic ones? I don't think so either. And then, well, what about you know, woman pay? Well, I guess if she didn't have any color. Listen, that's what CM Ward, &gt;&gt; that was the radio preacher of the Assembly of God. That's what he said 50 years ago. I guess if an old barn didn't have paint, you could go put another paint. Now, to think that we have almost the same kind of quote in the message, just a little cleaner. And now look at them. They look dusty. Is that really so wrong? I I have a feeling that the reason why it is is because it is a reflection of a bigger problem, a heart problem, &gt;&gt; a heart issue. Now, I don't mean a woman, she has a little pimple or something and but you've got to be so careful because you know here's one, there's one, there's one, there's one, there's one. That's what they used to call holiness &gt;&gt; preaching. The critics called it closline preaching. &gt;&gt; The believers called it holiness preaching, separation preaching. You just got to be so careful. You mean even now in 2026? So careful &gt;&gt; because the enemy will fool you. &gt;&gt; Well, I guess if she didn't have any eyebrows, I mean, I guess she could. And so now they go from brows to lashes and they buy them and they look like spiders. And it's not just the African-American people. It's a it's the white man and and every man and They all have to look you I I've been at red lights and look over and have to I say a normal woman to be slapping her face because it looks like tarantulas or sleeping on her eyelashes on her eyelids. It it it doesn't stop. It just go go go. Dresses get tighter. Slits get higher. I'm going to tell you how I preached it for many, many years. Your uh uh skirt and your dress length ends at the top of your slit. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Not at the bottom of it. At the top of it. So, if you shoot it all the way up your thigh, you you are wearing a miniskirt to me. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I don't care if it touches the ankles. If it's got a split that goes all the way up when you walk, it shows the very thing that the Bible says that a man shouldn't show it while he's doing the service of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if a man shouldn't show his legs on the approach to the altar, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Are these salvation issues? I'm not in any way trying to make them that, but they are reflective of the heart. Woo! They're shouting, "Run in the aisles." The same God who says that a woman should have long hair as her covering says, "Even nature itself teaches you that it is a shame for a man to have long hair." &gt;&gt; I dare somebody to ask me how long it is. You know, you know, brothers, you know, I have sons that know. I have church people that know. You know, I hear uh preachers preach against it when it's turned up on their collar. And I'm thinking, well, what's wrong then? Ponytail. You got to have a ponytail. No. If you're going to preach it, you you must be an example of it. whether you look good or not. &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to keep mine as short as I can because I want to be able to say exactly what the word says. Nature tells us nature. You don't even need the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just the very nature of men and women. Something on the inside will teach you. I'm not against a woman who feels that she needs to wear a head covering. I It does not offend me. It has never offended me. But if she chops it off so that she can cover it up with a rag, I am 100% against that. &gt;&gt; And that's what messed up. That's what messed up what we had in this area because you keep putting something on top putting a prayer uh cover veil or whatever you might call it because they get they get so now till it's just a band. I saw it. You saw it just a band of something. You see all the hair except just a band of something. Is does that qualify? The Bible said a woman's long hair is given her for a covering, but I don't mind, but you better stay with it. It's not that that testifies of the authority and power that's on your head. It's it's it's how long it's what's tucked under it. They tried to get that going through here one time. Do you remember I've pulled one in some years ago to my office and I said, "You better get a hold of that daughter of yours. She had better not look at my son one more time because I've got a feeling this is not going to stand. You can't cut it off and cover it with a cloth and think you're under submission to anything except man's some kind of man idea. Anybody still here? &gt;&gt; So, leave it alone. Cover it if you will. If you don't, don't. But keep it long. And And I don't have any If you think that I do, I don't I don't mind a bit. It's up to however that family feels and that person feels, I wouldn't care. It wouldn't hurt my feelings. It wouldn't upset me. It wouldn't bother me. I don't care how plain somebody wants to dress. I don't care how modest somebody wants to dress. I have said that before. Make sure. Let me say that again. If if anybody in this church puts pressure on anybody else to wear the style they wear or or the pattern they wear or the way they think they ought to wear it, you let me know because that's none of their business to do that. I don't care. Brother Green had anything from leather skirt. I saw it in the 90s to a to Sister Miles and Sandre with denim to the ground and rolled up sleeves. And he said, "I'm not going and you better not say nothing to them either. Let everybody have their standard. Just don't let yours be lower than what's preached from this desk &gt;&gt; because you have an obligation then." &gt;&gt; You don't go to Sam's and do it your way or Walmart or anywhere else. &gt;&gt; You want to be a part of something, you have a obligation. Anybody with me? &gt;&gt; My I'm getting hungry now. &gt;&gt; I've worked. I'm I'm not I'm not either. Just kidding. I'm I'm almost done. 1:30. Let's have church tonight and I'll preach another two or three hours. All right, I'm coming back to this. Woo. Where are we? Hallelujah. A Jew that despised idols. Uh he had failed. Got rid of the promise. There he stands. Where was I? Anybody remember? Oh, there we go. There's many men that reads the same Bibles we read in his office, preparing his message, run upon these truths of God, have to bypass them. He would be afraid to preach against the women cutting their hair. His organization would turn him out about them wearing immoral clothes and committed spiritual adultery. Spiritual adultery. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and about the man that takes a sociable drink on Christmas and gets out and has a little clean America fun, tells dirty jokes, still maintains the office as deacon. &gt;&gt; They know those things are wrong. &gt;&gt; You don't need a Bible or a preacher in 2026 to tell you they're wrong. &gt;&gt; But they're as it was in the days of Lot. We are back to that sinful place again. See, &gt;&gt; you say, "What are you preaching that in here for?" Because it goes beyond here. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you and I need to hear it, too. &gt;&gt; Oh, how Samson must have reminded by must have been reminded by the Holy Spirit that how he had failed God's people and failed God himself. Now he's a prisoner. Oh, dear Lord. Now he is a prisoner of the very thing that God Oh, dear Lord. Are you dramatic? I am I feel very dramatic now. He's a prisoner of the very thing that God raised him up &gt;&gt; and gave him power &gt;&gt; now. He's enslaved. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; No wonder Brother Brandham tells us, "You better destroy that thing before it destroys you." &gt;&gt; Oh, how Samson must have been reminded by the Holy Spirit how he failed God's people and had failed God himself. And now he's a prisoner of the very thing that God raised him up and give him power to destroy. A and I'm a member. I'm in this with you. Not a member of an organization. God forbid. But I'm a member by grace in the body of Christ. I'm your brother. I have no selfish motive motives. My motive to achieve anything personally. I'm only zealous for the Lord God. And I say this with all my heart. The very thing that you were called out of, you've gone back into it again. And as the Bible said, a s goes to her wallow, a dog returns to his vomit. And if the vomit made the dog sick in the first place, won't it make him and watch what he says? It's a greater sin. Somebody said, "I don't find that in the Bible." Oh, yes you do. If I build again the things that I once tore down, I make myself a transgressor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, that's according to the scripture. &gt;&gt; That's not things that you said on one of your whims or one of your religious fits. That's what you said that was according to the scripture because I've had the fits just like you've had the fits. And you God is not going to hold you responsible to a fit. Thank you, Lord. But he will hold you responsible to his word. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, they had him doing tricks to entertain them, and that's just about the way he's got way. It's got instead of a Holy Spirit. When someone raises up and gets arrogant, the Holy Spirit is obligated to God to shut that thing up. I've seen them pack them from the meeting, paralyzed, blinded, dumb, even die in the meeting. Right in the meeting, drop dead while they're trying to rebuke it. God in heaven knows that's right. Many of you here have been in other meetings and witnessed the same thing. Brother Weey dropped dead in the meeting at Brandom Tabernacle because Brother Brandham had called him out about something and it had made him mad. He said it. &gt;&gt; That's right. He said, brother, brother brother Bam said about brother Edway that he had a complex and he's sitting there thinking, "Ah, he ought not to have said that. They're going to think this, that, the other." And he died and had to be raised from the dead. And thank God he was. Were you there? No. But I know some that were. And I have power. I mean, I have confidence in the power they carried. And they'd never give me a reason not to believe that what they were saying was the truth. But I will tell you this. I I can confirm that he died. But I can confirm that he lived beyond that. You know why? Because I'm sitting in a basement in Jerusalem. No, I think we were probably still in the chapel on Nashibi Street in Jerusalem. And they bring in an older woman one day and they introduce me to her and they tell me her name is Sister Emmy. And I come to like her very much. I come to find that she is an outstanding little sister from uh Denmark or Sweden or or or or somewhere European and uh began to talk to her a little bit and I began to find out that she may be the only one in Jerusalem listening to brother Brandham's tapes for years. And I said, 'Well, how in the world would you have ever heard the name Brother Brandham if you've lived in Jerusalem all these years and kind of isolated and sort of living a life very similar to that of an Orthodox Jew? Who would you have been around that Oh, she said there was a brother and sister who came here from Jeffersonville many years ago, brother and sister Wade, and he baptized me in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and I got to be her pastor until she died. Now, you think about that a minute. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That he didn't leave here with some little funny feeling he got during the service. &gt;&gt; I'm glad. I'm so glad I I went and prayed for her in the hospital on Purum. You've heard the story. I won't repeat it, but I went to pray for her in the hospital and I'm standing over a room thinking this may be the last time. Maybe maybe is she the one we prayed for a purum? I can't remember for sure 100%. But anyway, I was at the hospital more than once. But I'm praying for her and and all of a sudden I just get filled with this feeling of walking in something that you that you like a like a vision that you didn't have, like a dream you didn't have, like perhaps you've stepped into somebody else's dream or stepped into somebody else's vision. And all I could do was just stand there thanking God that somebody came a generation before I was able to go. Somebody came and told her the truth and she was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. It's powerful. Last paragraph here. There ought to be a holy power surrounding and in the church that will make demons flee &gt;&gt; instead of it. It's become a laughingtock. The mechanics. The mechanics instead of the dynamics. I believe he said we needed both &gt;&gt; and now he's doing tricks. Oh, Lord have mercy. Now he's doing tricks. Musicians are coming. I don't want to leave you hopeless. It's about to get good. Can Can you show them the picture? I I don't know how to use AI very well for pictures or anything really, but I made one. uh he's sitting in the prison at a table because I found out that the image that brother Brandham had and the image that I always had in my mind of Samson couldn't have happened the way my mind saw it happening because the the rotary grinder kern had not been invented in the time of Samson. They were still using the handdrawn one. You see that one? Can you go back and look in the folder? No. Yes. Well, that's not Samson by any means. Uh, that is an Egyptian woman. Uh, will you go back and look in the original place and see if you happen to see that one there? Now, I'd like for the people to see that as we as we close. I added it later. Maybe I added it later and you took them from there or something along those lines. I was I thought it was kind of good. I thought I did pretty good. Oh yes. Oh yes. Ain't that good? I told I told that thing I said, "No, he's got too many muscles." And he I kept No, he's still got too many muscles. I reduced him down and then I said, "You put all his hair back on." No, he was shaven when he went in there. Don't give him a full head of hair. Give him the kind that you just rub and like. All these years in my mind, and brother Brandham also mentions this thing, all these years in my mind, I think about this rotary kind. But but it wasn't even invented for many many years after that. Kind of makes it sad when you think about it. So here he is in a prison house doing women's work. This is humiliating work. Only women did this kind of work and the prisoners. And he is literally on a stone grinding by hand every kernel by pushing that thing and applying pressure back and forth and back and forth and back and forth. It's hard work, laborous hate just uh they're mocking. It was humiliating. He can't see. Somebody had to keep coming in and helping him at it. Bible scholars say perhaps the lad. Perhaps he was a servant at the prison and he had to come in and help Samson to even know how to get more grain. Of course, you see it sitting close there like that. But they said there's a possibility that he had to be helped. That's the bad news. It was rough. It was tough. The champion now humiliated. Oh, that's bad, sad news. But the good news &gt;&gt; is on his head &gt;&gt; because it's growing back &gt;&gt; and shortly he's going to the show led by the little lad. &gt;&gt; Woo! And God's going to restore the mission. &gt;&gt; I want you to stand with me and I want to say again, it's bad out there, we've got to make sure that we are standing on the word &gt;&gt; in here &gt;&gt; because we're also to benefit when the hair grows back &gt;&gt; and the prayer is screamed just once more. Amen, &gt;&gt; Lord. And he sends that final wave. I said to brother Gley, then they were all looking for more. Now they have to make excuses &gt;&gt; for why it didn't happen that way. And instead of just saying God has a timing and we're still waiting on the fullness like the church has always had to say, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; For hundreds of years &gt;&gt; waiting on God to perform his word. But when he does, he does. &gt;&gt; How does he do it? Gradually, gradually, gradually, gradually, gradually, suddenly, &gt;&gt; and that's why the Bible said, "He that endeth to the end, that's &gt;&gt; the same shall be saved." Amen. &gt;&gt; In those days, the ministers would tell us, "We don't understand it all. We don't see it all yet. It's laid out here. The framework is here. We're waiting to understand something else in those thunders. We're waiting to understand something else in that seventh seal. And then according to the third seal message, the bride's revival will break out." Well, it hasn't happened like that. And so they have to come now and say it's all one big revival. Woohoo. Then why are the people going back? &gt;&gt; Why would we go back to Egypt &gt;&gt; if we're in the middle of the last final great move of God? What would be attractive to us about going back to denominational systems? I don't understand that. And I don't know if you do, but I don't understand that at all. And so I cry out, Lord, more understanding, more revelation. &gt;&gt; We just keep walking in what you have showed us to walk in and wait. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But I don't want to wait in backsliding condition. Do you? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; I want to wait full of the fire of God. &gt;&gt; I was telling brother Gley about a service in Arizona, northern Arizona. When the Lord spoke to my heart, Brother Green had got up after the preaching and he had said, "This I believe with all my heart, this is just a beginning of what God promised us or this last move." And he began to say some positive things like that. It made one of the old-timers from the gang pretty upset. and he was talking loud while brother Green was giving this little report on what he thought about the meeting we had just had was pretty powerful meeting and that brother was sitting back there alongside of brother Patterson and they were just oh they were just having the biggest time criticizing what had just been said neither one of them thought very much of brother Green and they certainly didn't think very much of me I was to them that little lad that got in the way not the one that didn't help. And so that uh one of the gangs said, "I'd like to test I'd like to testify. Can I testify, Brother Perry?" And sure, you've been talking loud anyway. And he just said, "I just want y'all to know it's just been one great big ball of revival, Holy Ghost fire revival since the prophet was here. I don't even know what these folks are talking about waiting on anything. It's all here. And uh Brother Green leaned over. He said, "He's deceived." Just like that. He's deceived. This was the first person I'd ever heard say anything like that. We're in a great midst of a great revival and have been since the 60s because the churches were dusty dry and they were crying out for something. The people wanted something &gt;&gt; and uh they were beginning to get a little drink of water and and here somebody wants to remind us of what it was. And the spirit of the Lord just uh revealed uh I don't know how God can reveal anything. Uh only way I know of about God revealing the past is if it is not under the blood. And God just began to describe this gentleman to me. and he worked pretty hard there for a few few years to hinder, but he had a change of heart. Anything is possible. And when I got through preaching Brother Green's funeral, he was standing in the aisle and he when I saw him, they told us, "We have to rush out. You've got to go out and be out of here before anybody else so that we can get to the cemetery first. I I grab my wife and we start up the aisle and he steps out in the aisle, a big old man. He steps out in the aisle and his arms are like this and I'm thinking, "Oh Lord, I remember you. I don't have time for this. You're just probably just as mad as you were 30 years ago." But he wasn't. He threw his arms around me and began to cry. He said, 'Oh, brother Shel, to think we have gone on now and you've gone on and done your thing. I've gone on and done mine and here we stand and God has given me the opportunity to look you in the eye and say, "I am so sorry. We so desperately needed what God was doing in those meetings." And there was just one thing that stood in the way and that was our pride. Will you forgive me? That that wasn't even a necessary question. But here's the point. We need then to go back and tell the people that we've coached out of the move of God. &gt;&gt; We need to go back and say, "Be hungry for the for the for the dynamic &gt;&gt; that comes on the mechanic. Yes. &gt;&gt; You You've got the framework. Now you need the fire. &gt;&gt; You've got the framework. Now you need the rain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got the framework. Now you need a fresh wind to blow. &gt;&gt; It's not not at all out of order to ask God to come again and perform his word in us. That's right. &gt;&gt; And for us, &gt;&gt; I believe it's going to take that for those who are hung out there in in sin, in bitterness, in a backsliden condition, failed by the church, but not failed by God. Oh, it don't look good. It don't look good. But &gt;&gt; the same he is yesterday and today and forever. &gt;&gt; Lord, if you ever did it once, &gt;&gt; you have the power. &gt;&gt; Just like Rachel asked, sing the song, Brother Shelly, he'll do it again. It wasn't just her cry. It ought to be every one of our cries. Do it again. Show yourself again. &gt;&gt; We're going to serve you right on regardless. But oh God, move in this house &gt;&gt; again without the weirdness, without the strangeness, &gt;&gt; but just the sincerity of heart. May we get under the pillar of fire and not run on until we're changed and cleansed. May we drink from the water. May we get our priorities straight while the hair is growing. May we uh find ourselves again thrilled with what you're doing. Oh God, we don't want to treat you like a performer saying we piped unto you and you didn't dance. We want it to be your way, &gt;&gt; your will in your timing, but we cry out again, Lord, once more. Let our hearts be turned back now to our fathers. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To those who paved the way for us. May we grab the faith that they showed us, modeled for us. &gt;&gt; Yes. May we live it out to the best of our ability. &gt;&gt; In the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. &gt;&gt; And the saint said, "What?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Would you pray for our dear friend, brother Bill, who will turn 82 tomorrow, not in good shape, the first year without his wife. Would you bless brother and sister Miller younger younger brother Daniel and sister Anna for their 31st anniversary and Sister Anna Christine has a a beautiful birthday one with a zero on the end on Friday. Let's bless her. Let's pray over her. I know this isn't uh for everyone, but I noticed that on this coming Saturday 17th, our dear precious Ma went home to be with the Lord in 2001. Who would have ever thought we would have been here 25 years later. I thought when she left here, I was going right behind her. But I couldn't give up. &gt;&gt; And we couldn't quit, could we? We just had to keep pressing through &gt;&gt; and we'll do it again for the next few years if that's what God will have. But we're going to cry out. We're going to reposition ourselves. Lord, send the Holy Spirit like the little lad to get us at the right position. Oh, don't get distracted now. &gt;&gt; Keep your eyes on the prize. Pray for this younger generation. &gt;&gt; Pray for them. Pray for the young married couples. Pray for them. They've got to grab it and they've got to model it for their children. &gt;&gt; Pray for them. Hold them up. Criticize less and pray more. &gt;&gt; Don't you believe that'll help us all? Lost are saved and find their way at the sound of your great name and all condemned. I feel no shame at the sound of your great name. And every fear, it has no place at the sound of your great name. the enemy. He has to leave at the sound of your great name. Jesus, worthy is the lamb that was slain for us.

Free us all, Lord. &gt;&gt; Free us right now. Let us break free. Let us come loose. Let us come out from under the influence of any lie that the enemy has spoken over us. May we come out from under it. May we break free. May we resist its hold on us. And may we now pick up the promises of God that have been forfeited along the way, dropped along the way by generations before us &gt;&gt; who wanted to be accepted more than they wanted to be anointed. So Lord, we ask right now that you let us identify what is laying around us. And may we not step over it anymore. May we not walk on anymore. May we recognize what has been dropped. What did our fathers drop? What did our grandfathers drop? May we pick it up, Lord, and claim it as our own. May we take a hold of every promise. May we take a hold of every promise. &gt;&gt; May we take a hold of it now in the name of Jesus &gt;&gt; and own it. May we not make excuses &gt;&gt; any longer but grab a hold. We do so much talking when we're not in here. We do so much talking. We we barely have time in a busy week to let the impact of your word fall on us. Some of us make such a pitiful effort to show up physically and spiritually and it sets such a low standard in this house. Father, may there be enough of us. Pick up, Jacob. I believe the Lord is calling to you. Don't lay let anything lay at your feet. May God help you identify anything that's been dropped. that you might claim it, that you might pick it up. My dad stood in a man-made lake in Foresight, Georgia at a youth camp as a teenager, convicted, promising God. so lost in the inspiration of the Holy Spirit that he staggered out into the water alone and promised God, I'll preach your word. I'll carry your gospel. I'll do whatever it is that you've called me to do. I believe he meant it at the moment like hundreds of others I know. But he got back to high school and my mother was pretty and she was a Baptist girl. And he dropped his co his calling, his commission, not because she forced him to, but because it was quite convenient to do it. And he lived a miserable life because of it. And look what God did for me. He's given me 50 plus years because somehow I don't understand how all these things work but somehow I not only carry my calling but I picked up his and I'm carrying it forward and I hope to give it to this generation. It doesn't make anybody a bad man. Doesn't make him a bad man or anybody else that drop. May God just show us, I mean individually and corporately. May God just show us anything that he wanted to do and the commission got dropped or the burden for it got dropped or or or the zeal for it got dropped and may we just sisters too. &gt;&gt; Sisters too because their mothers had no doubt desires and burdens. We're not talking about preaching but we're talking about evangelizing. We're talking about sharing the word with with your life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; If you've let that slip. If you've let your testimony slip, pick it up. &gt;&gt; If you've got under the influence of somebody's negative talk, cut that off today and call them out. Call them out. Hush your mouth. I don't want to hear no more of your defeated talk. I don't want to hear no more of your destructive talk. Just make sure you're not guilty of the same and pick up what the Lord would let you find and run with it. It's time to run with it. It doesn't just rest on two shoulders. It rests on all of our shoulders. &gt;&gt; I don't even feel a rebuke. I feel an invitation. &gt;&gt; I feel like the Lord's just inviting us. &gt;&gt; Do you want it? Do you want what you what's yours? And do you want what's been left? I do. I do. I do. I want it. I want the fullness of it &gt;&gt; without the weirdness. I want it. I want the pure, pure, unadulterated &gt;&gt; right out of the mouth of God. That's what I want. &gt;&gt; May we keep positioning ourselves by the spirit. I don't know why, but I just felt strongly like uh part of that was for Jacob and for for his generation and others like him. Why don't some of you brothers just lay hands on him? His dad had so much calling and so much potential and he kept putting it off and putting it off and putting it off until there was no more time left to put it off. I'm not trying to be critical. I'll answer for that. I'm not afraid to answer for that. It's a truth. &gt;&gt; It's a truth. &gt;&gt; And maybe that's why he came to me so strong there, Jacob, is is because he of what he represents. Uh would you want to if you leave it behind, would you want somebody not to touch it? No. You want somebody to get it and run on with it. Father, as he is uh lay as we lay hands on him and as these brothers pray over him right now, I pray, oh God, that he will represent a generation who will pick up things that have been forfeited, dropped, and left behind. He's in a precarious position. But oh God, he represents not only himself, but he represents a generation of others. Father, may we be mindful to pray for him and for those around him to pick up what has been dropped along the way and run, run with deliverance, run with freedom in the name of Jesus. May we make you a place, Lord. May we clear room in us for you to come and occupy the throne of our inner man, Jesus. Brother Gley, I know you're sick in the Lord. I don't want to disturb you, but would you lay hands on Jacob? I I just keep feeling to say it again. He He represent. It's not just his life, but it's it's who he represents &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus. Jason, do you do you and do you and Jacob get along? All right, come around. Would &gt;&gt; would you just represent the generation before him? Would you just symbolize that generation before him right now and just join your faith together with his in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Now Lord, we've got one representing a generation before. &gt;&gt; Jesus May both of these generations jump in. &gt;&gt; May they jump in. May they quit playing around on the shore. &gt;&gt; May they quit putting their toes in. And may they jump in. &gt;&gt; These two men represent two generations, Lord, that we cry out for right now. &gt;&gt; Two groups of people. God, you said through your prophet, you don't have any grandchildren. &gt;&gt; Here are representatives of two generations that must have their own experience with you. Howus say &gt;&gt; come Come on, reach your hand this way and pray a prayer of faith. Let's don't despise small things. Let's get on this for just another minute. Some of you is trying to figure out how that's possible that they represent two generations because of their family connection because technically they're they're of the same gener. But I'm talking about Jason has grown children, grown men with children of their own. So I'm placing him in this &gt;&gt; in the same generation, &gt;&gt; even though it's not quite there &gt;&gt; with Jacob's dad. And I believe it's the Lord. And I believe there's some redemption that I want to claim right now in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sister Flo, you come and put the third one. Put the third generation there. &gt;&gt; We're just we're just pretending that Jason is is a son, but he has been. &gt;&gt; Now, three-fold cord is not easily broken. And we're not just praying over a natural family. We're praying over something spiritual now &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; It matters. &gt;&gt; It matters. &gt;&gt; Jesus. together. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes.
