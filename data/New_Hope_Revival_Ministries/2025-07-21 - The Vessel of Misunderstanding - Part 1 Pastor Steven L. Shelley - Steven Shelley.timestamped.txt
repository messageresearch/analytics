[1:59] [Music]
[2:31] [Music]
[2:45] I'm going home with Jesus in the
[2:48] twinkling of tonight. And I made my
[2:51] reservation for a mansion in the sky. I
[2:54] may not know the moment and I may not
[2:57] know the day, but I know that I'll be
[3:00] leaving when he calls his church away.
[3:03] I'm going home to Jesus in the twinkling
[3:06] of an eye. And I made my reservation for
[3:10] a mansion in the sky. I may not know the
[3:14] moment. And I may not know the day, but
[3:17] I know that I'll be leaving when he
[3:19] calls his church away. The captain of
[3:22] the vessel. He's called and get on
[3:25] board. The destination's heaven. Safe on
[3:28] that crystal shore. We'll meet our
[3:31] splended savior and love you before.
[3:34] We'll live through all eternity. Thank
[3:37] God I'm going home. I'm going home to
[3:40] Jesus in the twinkling of an eye. When I
[3:44] made my reservation or a mansion in the
[3:47] sky, I may not know the moment and I may
[3:51] not know the day, but I know that I'll
[3:54] be leaving, but he calls his church
[3:56] away. I'm listening for the trumpet to
[3:59] sound any time. The crown of life that's
[4:03] awaiting. Thank God it'll soon be mine.
[4:06] I've got my invitation at a place called
[4:09] Calvary. And by the precious blood of
[4:12] Jesus, that deck's been paid for me. I'm
[4:15] going home with Jesus in the twinkling
[4:18] of an eye. And I made my reservation or
[4:22] a mansion in the sky. I may not know the
[4:25] moment. And I may not know the day, but
[4:28] I know that I'll be leaving when he
[4:31] calls his church away. Well, I'm going
[4:34] home with Jesus in the twinkling of an
[4:37] eye. And I made my reservation for a
[4:40] mansion in the sky. I may not know the
[4:43] moment and I may not know the day, but I
[4:47] know that I'll be leaving when he calls
[4:49] his church away. I'm a listener
[4:53] to sound any time. Look around waiting.
[4:58] Thank God he will soon be mine. And I've
[5:00] got my invitation at a place called
[5:03] Calvary. Oh, by the precious blood of
[5:06] Jesus. That debt's been paid for me. I'm
[5:10] going home with Jesus. And the children
[5:12] of the night, and I made my resurre,
[5:17] [Music]
[5:20] and I may not know the day, but I know
[5:23] that I'll be leaving when he calls his
[5:26] church away. Well, I'm going home with
[5:29] Jesus in the twin of an eye. And I made
[5:33] my reservation for a mansion in the sky.
[5:36] I may not know the moment and I may not
[5:40] know the day, but I know that I'll be
[5:43] leaving when he calls his church away. I
[5:46] heard an old
[5:48] story.
[5:50] How a savior came from glory.
[5:54] how he gave his life on Calvary
[5:59] to save a rich like me.
[6:04] I heard about his groaning
[6:08] of his precious blood
[6:11] atoning.
[6:12] Oh, then I repented of my sin and won
[6:18] the victory.
[6:20] [Music]
[6:22] Victory
[6:24] in Jesus
[6:26] my savior
[6:28] forever.
[6:30] Well, he sought me and he bought me with
[6:36] his redeeming blood.
[6:40] He loved me and I knew him and all my
[6:45] love is to him. He clungs me to victory
[6:54] beneath the cleansing blood.
[6:58] I heard about his healing
[7:02] of his cleansing power revealing
[7:06] how he made the way to walk again. And
[7:11] he caused the light to see.
[7:16] Oh, and then I cry, "Dear Jesus,
[7:20] come and heal my broken
[7:23] spirit."
[7:25] And somehow Jesus came and brought to me
[7:30] the victory.
[7:33] Well, victory
[7:36] in Jesus
[7:38] my savior
[7:40] forever.
[7:42] till he saw me
[7:45] and he bought me with his redeeming

[8:05] beneath the kings.
[8:09] I heard about that mansion that he has
[8:15] built for me in glory.
[8:18] And I heard about
[8:21] those streets of gold just beyond the
[8:25] crystal sea. Oh, and about the angels
[8:30] singing
[8:32] in that open
[8:35] story
[8:37] and some sweet I'll sing up there that
[8:42] song of victory.
[8:45] Well, victory
[8:48] in Jesus

[8:52] forever.
[8:54] Well, he saw me, you know, he bought me
[8:59] with his redeeing blood. Well, he loved

[9:24] in Jesus. You're my savior
[9:28] forever.

[9:45] love it is to him. Keep rising
[9:50] to victory
[9:53] beneath the dead.
[9:56] [Music]
[10:00] Oh, hallelujah.
[10:04] Hallelujah.
[10:08] I searched the world,
[10:13] but it couldn't fill me.
[10:18] and a man's empty place and treasures of
[10:22] faith are never enough.
[10:28] But then you came along
[10:33] and you put me back together

[34:48] king.
[34:51] As we have been hearing over these past
[34:54] weeks
[34:56] about being poured out from vessel to
[34:58] vessel,
[35:00] that all of the dregs, all of the leaves
[35:03] are gone
[35:04] &gt;&gt; as we're poured from vessel to vessel
[35:07] &gt;&gt; so that we can be a drink for the king.
[35:13] Oh Lord,
[35:16] &gt;&gt; we pour our love out on you,
[35:19] &gt;&gt; King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; To you today,
[35:29] we lift up our soul,
[35:32] our mind, our will, and our emotions.
[35:36] [Music]
[35:38] That that tries to get the best of us so
[35:42] that we are not poured out. That that
[35:45] tries to get the best of us so that you
[35:47] do not get the praise that you deserve.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; Lord, we lift it up to you.
[35:54] We yield it to you, Lord.
[35:57] We bring our praise to you,
[36:00] pouring out our praise,
[36:03] our love, our adoration to the King of
[36:06] Kings.
[36:09] For you deserve
[36:12] only the highest praise.
[36:17] We worship you, Lord.
[36:21] We worship you, Lord.
[36:24] Would you just lift your hands into his
[36:26] presence just a moment
[36:28] &gt;&gt; as we just take a moment to love on him?
[36:33] &gt;&gt; Worthy is the lamb.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You are worthy, King of
[36:38] Kings.
[36:40] You are worthy, Lord of Lords.
[36:45] High above it all,
[36:48] &gt;&gt; the price that you paid at Calvary
[36:53] &gt;&gt; with the very blood of God poured out,
[36:57] the price of redemption
[37:00] to draw me back to you.
[37:03] &gt;&gt; You are worthy, Lord.

[1:01:21] seated just a moment. If you are
[1:01:25] streaming the service this morning, we
[1:01:28] would so very much like I I think I'll
[1:01:31] ask just a few a few weeks maybe now in
[1:01:34] a row. We would so very much like to
[1:01:38] know uh where you're from and where
[1:01:42] you're streaming from. We have so many
[1:01:44] people who would rather remain anonymous
[1:01:48] and we understand that. Thank you. Is
[1:01:50] that did that do it? We understand that.
[1:01:54] But if you are uh in a position where
[1:01:57] you can uh let us know, well, we would
[1:02:00] just very much like to know where you
[1:02:02] are. And uh we're getting such great
[1:02:07] great reports from so many places. if
[1:02:11] you are if you're doing it on the app or
[1:02:14] if you greet us on the app, as soon as
[1:02:16] the service is over, that's gone and we
[1:02:19] can't see it. And I'm I don't generally
[1:02:22] look at it too often during the service.
[1:02:25] But uh I just wanted to let you know
[1:02:27] that. But everyone who is streaming now,
[1:02:31] we just greet you in the name of the
[1:02:32] Lord Jesus Christ. We want to go to the
[1:02:35] Lord in prayer for just a moment. Uh,
[1:02:38] how many of you have an unspoken need in
[1:02:40] the house? God sees your need. Would you
[1:02:44] continue to remember Sister Evelyn Fox
[1:02:46] to the Lord? Would you remember Jessica
[1:02:49] to the Lord this morning? She is not
[1:02:51] feeling well at all. Quite sick, they
[1:02:54] say. Uh, Brother David man is
[1:02:57] recovering. And, uh, I wasn't expecting
[1:03:00] to see him this morning, but I'm really
[1:03:02] glad to see him. Let's believe that the
[1:03:04] Lord will accelerate his healing. Amen.
[1:03:08] And uh brother Jerry was not able. He
[1:03:10] wanted to be here today, but he posted
[1:03:13] in the app that he wasn't able to be
[1:03:15] here physically. And we understand that,
[1:03:17] but we're asking the Lord to be with
[1:03:19] him. Would you remember brother Liam? Uh
[1:03:22] he is uh home in New Mexico and uh of
[1:03:26] course desires our prayers for final and
[1:03:30] great further I should say further
[1:03:31] leadership in his life. The Lord knows
[1:03:34] he has everything in his great big
[1:03:36] capable hands and Jason is traveling uh
[1:03:40] this weekend and so we want to lift him
[1:03:42] up to the Lord in prayer. Sister Kathy
[1:03:45] has experienced a great loss to her and
[1:03:49] to her son Elmer and uh a companion. I
[1:03:53] was reading early this morning where
[1:03:55] brother Brandham was talking about uh
[1:03:57] Prince his horse and he was talking
[1:04:00] about Fritz his dog and how that uh in
[1:04:04] that experience with the Lord he saw he
[1:04:07] said I knew I would see Prince
[1:04:10] uh and he saw him and he saw his dog his
[1:04:13] hunting dog uh Fritz and as the vision
[1:04:18] was coming to an end and the Lord just
[1:04:21] spoke out and and hold him. Everything
[1:04:24] you've ever loved will be there.
[1:04:29] I don't know how God pulls that off. I
[1:04:32] don't know how he does it. I don't know
[1:04:34] how that is even possible, but I'm going
[1:04:37] to I'm going to count on it.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; I'm going to count on it. So, would you
[1:04:41] pray for Sister Kathy and Bo and her son
[1:04:43] Elmer and uh that the Lord would just
[1:04:46] continue to to strengthen them and
[1:04:48] comfort them. She has lost a significant
[1:04:51] part of her life. And and what makes it
[1:04:53] so special is uh you know the these
[1:04:57] animals that we get in our life, they
[1:04:59] love us in our good times and our bad
[1:05:02] times. If we're ill and we raise our
[1:05:04] voice, they just forgive us. All it
[1:05:06] takes is a another bowl of food or
[1:05:08] treat. They just forgive us so quickly.
[1:05:11] They don't hold grudges. And we can tell
[1:05:13] them our secrets.
[1:05:16] They don't ever tell anybody.
[1:05:19] We can tell them how rough it is and
[1:05:22] sometimes they become uh like family to
[1:05:25] us. So, she didn't ask me to mention it
[1:05:27] and may may have wished that I didn't,
[1:05:29] but I thought it was uh enough. I I uh I
[1:05:34] had a couple times of meeting this
[1:05:36] special u member of her family so to
[1:05:40] speak and uh I know that uh he was
[1:05:43] indeed special to her and he was indeed
[1:05:45] special. So ask the Lord to bring
[1:05:48] comfort and and help them to move
[1:05:50] forward. Um
[1:05:52] loss is loss.
[1:05:55] It's just kind of hard to push through
[1:05:56] sometime. This Thursday is Sister
[1:05:59] Judith's birthday and she is not with
[1:06:02] us. She is in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada,
[1:06:05] taking care of her precious parents,
[1:06:07] Brother and Sister Wgner. And we want to
[1:06:10] send love to her. Um I'm hoping to
[1:06:13] remember on Thursday again, but uh I
[1:06:16] have it wrote down today, so I know I
[1:06:18] know if I read it, I'll remember. And we
[1:06:20] want to say to her how much we
[1:06:22] appreciate her prayers. There's one
[1:06:25] thing I know that no matter where she is
[1:06:27] in the world, she's praying for my
[1:06:28] family.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; That means a awful lot. How many of you
[1:06:32] know that?
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; To know there's someone always lifting
[1:06:36] up you and your family to the Lord, it
[1:06:38] means a lot. It means a lot. This week
[1:06:41] Joshua had a a run in with a with a
[1:06:44] grinder, and it could have been much
[1:06:47] more severe than it was. It was the dull
[1:06:50] blade. Thank the Lord. And not the new
[1:06:53] sharp one that was going on it. And
[1:06:55] we're very, very thankful for that. But
[1:06:57] it's still a call you don't really want
[1:06:58] to get. But God has been good. He got
[1:07:01] stitches. He continued to work. And uh
[1:07:04] it's healing quite well. And there's
[1:07:06] just a little bit of, you know, how it
[1:07:08] is. It takes a while for things to go
[1:07:10] back together and feel good again. But
[1:07:12] it's in moments like that that you can
[1:07:14] really appreciate the prayers you get
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; and the faithful prayers. Amen. Thursday
[1:07:19] is also brother Greg and and sister
[1:07:22] Samantha's anniversary and we s
[1:07:24] certainly have missed them. I we haven't
[1:07:26] seen them now in quite a while but we
[1:07:28] send our love to them the same and we uh
[1:07:31] wish them a very happy wedding
[1:07:33] anniversary on Thursday. Fellowship
[1:07:36] meetings are coming up soon. Saturday,
[1:07:39] August the 2nd and third. Let's see what
[1:07:42] the Lord will do.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many of you know he's more
[1:07:46] than able
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; to supply every one of our needs?
[1:07:51] David, is is that too personal?
[1:07:55] Would you share it?
[1:07:57] Uh there is like a real hollow sound in
[1:08:00] my in my monitor. It sounds like I'm
[1:08:03] almost dropped in. I don't know if it
[1:08:04] sounds that way out there, but it's not
[1:08:06] it doesn't sound nice up here.
[1:08:10] I I know you're you weren't prepared.
[1:08:12] What? come and get this mic here.
[1:08:16] And if it's too personal, just leave out
[1:08:18] the dirty details, but but share your
[1:08:22] testimony, would you?
[1:08:24] You can stand. I'll move and you can
[1:08:26] stand over here if you want to. Um
[1:08:30] I uh
[1:08:33] Brother Shelley preached I think two
[1:08:34] Sundays ago about tithing and
[1:08:38] I realized I was doing it wrong. not for
[1:08:41] any personal reasons, just didn't know
[1:08:44] better. And
[1:08:46] so Ashley and I were both convicted
[1:08:49] separately. And when we got home, she
[1:08:51] said, "Did you hear that?" I said,
[1:08:52] "Yes." So she said, "We need to make it
[1:08:54] right what we can." And so immediately
[1:08:57] we paid it the right way that day. And
[1:09:00] then the next day I get home, she said,
[1:09:03] "I have something to show you." And
[1:09:05] there was a check in the mail for $500.
[1:09:08] It was 468 I believe that we were not
[1:09:11] expecting just from the department of
[1:09:13] Georgia the revenue and we were like wow
[1:09:16] that is God and it was in the mail
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; because we were on vacation it already
[1:09:23] came in the mail it was sitting in the
[1:09:24] mailbox and so then we're like wow that
[1:09:27] is God and I had told some of the
[1:09:30] brothers I wanted to share it on Tuesday
[1:09:32] but um I it just it just I just didn't
[1:09:37] and and I shared them with him in the
[1:09:38] back. And then uh on Friday, I was like,
[1:09:42] you know, I haven't paid tithe on my
[1:09:45] garden. I wanted to pay tithe on my
[1:09:47] garden. And so I did that. And then I
[1:09:51] believe it was maybe Monday or Tuesday
[1:09:52] the next week, we get a letter in the
[1:09:55] mail saying that Ashley had a check that
[1:09:58] she hadn't cashed from 2024,
[1:10:03] March of 2024.
[1:10:05] and like you just fill this out, send it
[1:10:07] in, and we'll send you the money. And I
[1:10:12] just want to thank God for that, I
[1:10:13] believe immediately. And that check that
[1:10:17] that mail was sent
[1:10:20] July 3rd before we even made a change.
[1:10:25] And I believe my garden is doing better.
[1:10:27] We've been getting like bowls and bowls
[1:10:29] of tomatoes every day. And so I just
[1:10:33] want to thank the Lord for providing and
[1:10:34] being faithful.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That's good.
[1:10:38] [Applause]
[1:10:41] That's good.
[1:10:45] God is faithful. You know, sometimes we
[1:10:48] never get to hear uh when someone takes
[1:10:51] something serious on their heart and
[1:10:53] begins to do it. I know there are
[1:10:55] critics. I know there are people who'd
[1:10:56] say, "Well, you know, you really can't
[1:10:58] give God glory." Well, yeah, I would
[1:11:00] give him glory. Anytime a check arrives
[1:11:02] at my house or my or the church here,
[1:11:05] I'm giving him glory.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God sees you. You We've got to
[1:11:09] remember he saw ahead.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; And uh I wonder what is heading your
[1:11:14] way. What's coming your way? Well,
[1:11:16] praise the Lord for it now.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord for it in advance.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; And let's see what he'll do. Would you
[1:11:23] give thanks to God for these musicians?
[1:11:26] [Applause]
[1:11:33] Let's stand. And I would just tell you,
[1:11:36] I'm not 100% this morning. Much better.
[1:11:39] I'm not 100% this morning, but he is
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; more than enough.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; More than enough. And it never crossed
[1:11:48] my mind not to be standing here. Never
[1:11:52] crossed my mind. I knew I had to be
[1:11:54] here. Whether I was propped up or
[1:11:56] sitting or standing or or or or running
[1:11:59] out for a minute and coming back, I I
[1:12:02] knew that this is where I'm supposed to
[1:12:03] be. And uh he gives us strength, doesn't
[1:12:06] he?
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; All the way. Uh would you turn in your
[1:12:10] Bible this morning to Jeremiah? I guess
[1:12:14] you knew that, didn't you? Chapter 48
[1:12:18] and verse 11.
[1:12:20] because there are so many people that
[1:12:23] are joining us
[1:12:25] about a third of the way into this
[1:12:28] series. So, I want to make sure that we
[1:12:31] catch them up at least with our original
[1:12:35] text. This is the prophet Jeremiah
[1:12:38] and he is prophesying
[1:12:41] concerning the really the rebellion of
[1:12:45] Moab and what is to come. He is
[1:12:50] reminding them that just because you
[1:12:52] haven't had some difficult time doesn't
[1:12:54] mean there it's not on the way. It's on
[1:12:58] the way. He said and it's going to be
[1:13:00] for your own good. Now all things that
[1:13:04] happen to us are not good but all things
[1:13:07] that happen to us happen
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; for our good. Do you really believe that
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Moab hath been at ease from his youth?
[1:13:20] And he hath settled on his leaves,
[1:13:26] and hath not been emptied from vessel to
[1:13:29] vessel, neither hath he gone into
[1:13:32] captivity. Therefore, his taste remained
[1:13:37] in him and his scent is not changed.
[1:13:43] This scripture is telling us that the
[1:13:46] dregs, the leaves of the wine has
[1:13:50] remained in the wine and it has greatly
[1:13:54] affected the flavor and the fragrance of
[1:13:58] the wine. I want you to turn to Psalm
[1:14:02] 66.
[1:14:03] for today's text
[1:14:06] verses 10- 12. We are getting ready to
[1:14:12] introduce the nitty-gritty of the vessel
[1:14:16] of misunderstanding.
[1:14:19] The psalmist said in verse 10, "For
[1:14:22] thou, oh God, hast proved us.
[1:14:27] Thou hast
[1:14:29] tried us
[1:14:31] as
[1:14:33] say it. Silver is tried. You've proved
[1:14:37] us. Let's go back. You proved us. You've
[1:14:42] tried us even as silver is tried. How
[1:14:46] many of you know how silver is tried?
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; With extreme heat.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Not in comfort, but in discomfort. Thou
[1:14:58] broughtest us into the net. Thou ladest
[1:15:02] affliction upon our loins.
[1:15:06] Thou hast caused men to ride over our
[1:15:09] heads.
[1:15:11] We went through fire
[1:15:14] and water.
[1:15:16] We went through fire and through water,
[1:15:20] but thou brought us,
[1:15:24] thou broughtest us out
[1:15:27] into a
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; wealthy place.
[1:15:33] Let's look at it in the amplified. For
[1:15:35] you, oh God, have proved us.
[1:15:39] You have tried us as silver is tried,
[1:15:43] refined
[1:15:45] and purified. You brought us into the
[1:15:49] net, the prison, the fortress, the
[1:15:53] dungeon. It could have been any of those
[1:15:56] places in your life. You laid a heavy
[1:15:59] burden upon our loins. You caused men to
[1:16:04] ride over our heads while we were
[1:16:07] prostrate. We went through fire and
[1:16:11] through water, but you brought us out
[1:16:14] into a broad
[1:16:17] and that word broad is the is the best
[1:16:20] translation of that Hebrew word. You
[1:16:23] have brought us into a broad moist
[1:16:28] place.
[1:16:30] I know some people don't like the word
[1:16:33] but it requires moisture
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; for the germination of life.
[1:16:38] So the psalmist is saying, Lord, because
[1:16:41] of you, you've brought us into a wide,
[1:16:45] broad,
[1:16:47] productive place
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; to abundance and refreshment and
[1:16:54] open air, wealthy places,
[1:16:58] valuable places, places of abundance.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; But not until
[1:17:04] we were tried like silver in the fire.
[1:17:07] Father, thank you that you are a good
[1:17:10] good papa to us.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; You know what we need when we need it.
[1:17:16] You rescue us from the pit.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Your hand reaches farther down than we
[1:17:21] can reach up.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; You are both savior, healer, deliverer,
[1:17:26] sanctifier, holy ghost baptizer,
[1:17:30] and so much more to us. But Lord, you
[1:17:35] you know how to work in us to purify and
[1:17:40] refine us.
[1:17:42] Sometimes it takes fire. Sometimes it
[1:17:45] takes misunderstanding.
[1:17:47] Whatever it takes, Lord, we trust you.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; We trust you. The Lord gives. The Lord
[1:17:53] takes away. The Lord provides.
[1:17:57] The Lord withholds.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; It's just him. But Lord, we thank you
[1:18:02] that you are faithful in all of your
[1:18:04] ways. And we remember that the righteous
[1:18:07] are never forsaken.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; We always have you and we have your
[1:18:12] provision. Help us in this service
[1:18:15] today. Strengthen each person who
[1:18:17] struggles in their body for the glory of
[1:18:20] God. In the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:18:22] Christ, Yeshua, our Messiah, we pray.
[1:18:25] And the saints said,
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Be seated. Do your work. do your
[1:18:30] part. Would you do that?
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Uh, we know that in ancient times,
[1:18:35] vessels for fermentation
[1:18:38] were normally made out of earthn vessels
[1:18:41] or what we might call clay vessels. I
[1:18:45] showed you the pictures of the amphora,
[1:18:48] the the the particularly shaped earthn
[1:18:52] jars that wine was most often kept in. I
[1:18:56] also showed you, thank you. There's a
[1:18:58] great reminder and you can go into caves
[1:19:02] right now in Israel,
[1:19:05] uh, solid rock caves and find ledges
[1:19:11] that have been carved out of the side of
[1:19:14] the cave with with holes,
[1:19:18] oh, about that deep. Perfectly round
[1:19:21] holes about that deep. Put those
[1:19:24] pictures back up if you will. Did you
[1:19:27] notice how they're shaped on the bottom?
[1:19:30] The the uh angular
[1:19:33] uh I don't cone shape I guess you would
[1:19:36] say uh at the bottom of those vessels so
[1:19:40] that they can sit right down in those
[1:19:42] holes because wine was often left to
[1:19:47] ferment in a in a dark and cool
[1:19:50] environment. How many of you can
[1:19:52] understand that? And uh as the second
[1:19:55] picture that Charity was showing there
[1:19:57] again is there is a wine press inside
[1:20:00] the cave. And I'm sure that if we were
[1:20:03] able to see the entire uh surrounding
[1:20:06] that we would probably see those same
[1:20:09] impressions or uh round dugout places
[1:20:13] where those vessels would sit. We also
[1:20:16] showed you the the wine skins made from
[1:20:19] the skin of a goat or sometimes a sheep.
[1:20:23] And we talked about how they have to to
[1:20:26] be uh stretchable. They have to have an
[1:20:29] elasticity so that as the wine begins to
[1:20:32] ferment and expand, the skin goes with
[1:20:35] it. If it's too old, if it's gotten too
[1:20:39] dry and it looks like that,
[1:20:43] then it will burst.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; It can't hold the pressure. How many of
[1:20:48] you can say today, I can hold the
[1:20:49] pressure?
[1:20:51] Oh, I didn't get a lot of votes for
[1:20:52] that. It's a good thing we're not
[1:20:55] electing a president here.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Uh, I didn't get a lot of votes for
[1:20:58] that. You can. Let me tell you
[1:21:00] something. God promised in his word that
[1:21:03] he would not put more on us,
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; than we could possibly bear. I believe
[1:21:09] that.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; And so, I can handle it.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; I want to say today, with the help and
[1:21:15] the and the grace of the Lord Jesus
[1:21:18] Christ, I can handle it. I've got to be
[1:21:21] wine in his cup.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; I've got to bring refreshment and honor
[1:21:25] to him.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; He's worthy of it all.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; But I want to tell you that the vessel
[1:21:30] of misunderstanding is neither an earthn
[1:21:33] vessel nor a vessel made of skin, but
[1:21:37] it's actually a vessel made of glass.
[1:21:40] There are those who would think, well, I
[1:21:42] can't imagine that in Bible times, and
[1:21:45] this was particularly in New Testament
[1:21:48] times, it was because of the spreading
[1:21:51] influence of the Romans, that Roman
[1:21:55] world was expanding daily, both in
[1:21:58] knowledge and in territory. And the
[1:22:01] Romans brought this amazing, beautiful
[1:22:04] colored glass to Israel. And it is found
[1:22:08] today in almost every archaeological dig
[1:22:11] in the nation. And because it has been
[1:22:14] underneath the pressure of the earth all
[1:22:18] these years and layers of dirt and the
[1:22:20] pressure and the weight has sort of
[1:22:23] taken that broken glass and created
[1:22:27] something entirely different. I don't
[1:22:29] have any in my office or I would have
[1:22:32] brought it out and showed you. But uh
[1:22:35] someone gave me a beautiful set of of
[1:22:38] cufflinks that have as the stone uh what
[1:22:43] we call Roman glass, but it's it's you
[1:22:46] wouldn't know it was glass because it is
[1:22:49] multicolored. It almost looks like a a
[1:22:52] more vibrant version of the mother of
[1:22:55] pearl. You know what that looks like
[1:22:56] with the little rainbow colors in it.
[1:22:59] And this glass was being used in Israel
[1:23:03] in the time of the New Testament. In
[1:23:06] fact, about a hundred years before New
[1:23:10] Testament times. Uh this was not clear
[1:23:13] glass. This was tinted glass or colored
[1:23:18] glass. And this glass vessel was
[1:23:24] particularly used when wine was being
[1:23:27] made in smaller batches for families of
[1:23:31] great importance and great wealth. This
[1:23:35] was especially true in royal families.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; So I want you to know that you are
[1:23:41] special wine. Amen.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; You are from a very
[1:23:48] uh wealthy
[1:23:50] well-known royal family.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; How many of you believe that?
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; You see, my my father, my creator I is
[1:24:00] uh over it all.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; And and the and the Messiah called me
[1:24:04] his elder brother. I mean his brother.
[1:24:07] He is our elder brother.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; And so we're thankful to be part of that
[1:24:11] family. It's the royal seed of Abraham.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; I have royal blood running through my
[1:24:18] veins.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; So, I'm not just anybody's uh box wine.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. I'm being prepared for a
[1:24:26] family uh that is of great importance.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. The family of God. I'm part of
[1:24:32] that family of God. So, uh you wouldn't
[1:24:35] find glass fermenting uh vessels in in
[1:24:40] most common homes, but you would uh find
[1:24:43] it in New Testament times in homes where
[1:24:47] there is prestige. While the Romans may
[1:24:51] have used clear glass for serving wine,
[1:24:54] pouring wine out, the glass that was
[1:24:57] used for fermentation would have been
[1:24:59] tinted glass and different tints and
[1:25:03] colors were added to the glass to aid in
[1:25:07] continuing the fermentation process.
[1:25:10] Roman glass makers were skilled in
[1:25:13] creating a range of vibrant colors by
[1:25:16] adding metal oxides to the to the sand
[1:25:20] crystals as the glass was being heated.
[1:25:24] For example, iron being added to the
[1:25:28] glass
[1:25:29] would make it green in color. And if you
[1:25:33] added manganesees, you would get purple
[1:25:36] hues out of the glass. Other common
[1:25:39] colors would have been blue, brown,
[1:25:42] yellow, and even something that is
[1:25:44] referred to as dicroic glass, which
[1:25:48] appears to change color depending on how
[1:25:50] the light hits it. It It's almost
[1:25:53] crystalallike in nature. As the wine is
[1:25:57] emptied into this tinted glass vessel,
[1:26:01] its deep dark red color would then
[1:26:05] assume the hue that is created by that
[1:26:09] particular shade and color of the glass
[1:26:12] when viewed through the vessel. If
[1:26:14] you're looking through tinted glass,
[1:26:16] they they talk about there's an
[1:26:18] expression that says he sees the world
[1:26:21] through rose tinted glasses.
[1:26:24] Everything looks rosy to him whether
[1:26:27] it's rosy or not. You ever known anybody
[1:26:29] like that? Well, I haven't known near
[1:26:31] enough people like that.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; I'd like to know some more people like
[1:26:35] that. I I have spent most of my sojourn
[1:26:39] with those who see the glass half empty.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you like to live with somebody,
[1:26:46] worship with somebody who could see it
[1:26:48] always
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; full? half full on its way to being
[1:26:53] full.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; So the tenting of the glass would change
[1:26:58] the outward observation of the wine that
[1:27:01] was inside. So you'd never be able to
[1:27:04] know when the wine was perfectly ready
[1:27:08] by looking through the tinted color
[1:27:10] glass. In fact, we found out that as the
[1:27:15] as the wine would take on the hue of the
[1:27:19] particular color of the glass when
[1:27:21] viewed through the vessel, for instance,
[1:27:24] here's an example. If you pour that deep
[1:27:27] red wine into a green vessel, green
[1:27:31] glass vessel, it would cause the wine to
[1:27:35] lose its vibrant deep red color and it
[1:27:39] would turn it darker, muddier
[1:27:42] redish, reddish with hints of brown. It
[1:27:46] would more or less look muddy. You
[1:27:49] wouldn't want to uh to you know choose
[1:27:53] wine by that kind of an image that you
[1:27:56] were getting from the outside. That's
[1:27:58] why we call it the vessel of
[1:27:59] misunderstanding. You can't look from
[1:28:02] the outside.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; You see you see Jesse
[1:28:08] you you you see Jesse
[1:28:11] man
[1:28:12] looks on the outward appearance.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; But God sees the heart.
[1:28:19] You brought your champion sons down here
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; a
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; and they all look indeed uh well enough,
[1:28:27] strong enough, smart enough, courageous
[1:28:30] enough to fill the responsibility of the
[1:28:33] king.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; But I'm not finding what is necessary in
[1:28:37] any of these sons.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Don't you have another son somewhere?
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; There's got to be another. Well,
[1:28:48] yes. I I I've got that I've got that
[1:28:52] boy, that youngest boy of mine. He's
[1:28:56] down there taking care of the sheep.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; And maybe one of the other brothers
[1:29:00] spoke up and said, "Yeah, we're on the
[1:29:03] battlefield. We're fighting for the
[1:29:05] defense of the nation, and all he's
[1:29:08] doing is is down there handling the
[1:29:10] sheep, and he's not always doing such a
[1:29:13] good job at that." Samuel the prophet
[1:29:16] just said, "Bring him to me."
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Bring him here. I want to look at him.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Because man looks on the outward shell.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Man looks at the tinted glass. Man looks
[1:29:28] on the layer, the surface of what can be
[1:29:31] seen or perceived. But God sees beyond
[1:29:34] the badger skin, brother. God sees
[1:29:37] what's on the inside. And it is by that
[1:29:40] that he chooses us. It's by that that he
[1:29:43] anoints us. It's what he knows about our
[1:29:46] heart.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; You may seem to be the most religious of
[1:29:50] them all
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; and the most spiritual of them all on
[1:29:55] the surface, but God's not looking at
[1:29:57] your performance only. He's looking at
[1:30:00] your heart. He alone has the right to
[1:30:04] judge our motives.
[1:30:06] One of the things the Lord dealt with me
[1:30:08] about a couple of weeks ago in prayer,
[1:30:10] he said, "I'm going to deal with
[1:30:12] hypocrisy in my church first.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; I'm going to deal with that first and
[1:30:18] foremost."
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; I'm going to seek out those who pretend
[1:30:23] to be one thing and live an entirely
[1:30:26] different thing. That's what I'm going
[1:30:28] to deal with first.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm depending on him.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. If there's any hypocrisy in my
[1:30:35] life, I want it dug out with a grubbing
[1:30:38] hole.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; I want it revealed to me so that I can
[1:30:42] do something about it.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; I'm not particularly excited about it
[1:30:46] being revealed to you, but I'm very
[1:30:48] excited about it being revealed to me
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; because I'm the only one who can take it
[1:30:55] up with the creator.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; I'm the only one that can make up my
[1:30:59] mind. I cannot stress to you today the
[1:31:02] importance enough of having a determined
[1:31:06] mind,
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; having a madeup mind to hold out, to
[1:31:10] hold on, to go all the way.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; And to be what you say you are.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the life of Jesus Christ that
[1:31:21] we claim.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; We claim to be the very reflection of
[1:31:26] his light in the earth. May our lives
[1:31:29] begin to line up.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; You see, he sees those things you you
[1:31:36] try on in the dressing room.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; And he sees those things you hide in the
[1:31:42] back of the closet.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; And he sees those things you pull out on
[1:31:46] occasion to just make sure it still fits
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; when you don't even need it.
[1:31:54] [Music]
[1:31:56] He even sees the dime bag.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; He sees the edibles.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; He knows exactly what's going on in our
[1:32:08] lives.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; And he's calling us to a place of
[1:32:11] integrity.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; I've spoken to my own children recently.
[1:32:16] I've spoken to my own family and I've
[1:32:18] spoken to anyone else that I had an
[1:32:20] opportunity to speak to. Integrity is
[1:32:23] everything.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; It's everything. It's so much a part of
[1:32:28] our character in Jesus Christ.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; That means we've got to say what we mean
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; and mean what we say. It means we can't
[1:32:40] expect somebody to read between the
[1:32:42] lines and figure it out on their own and
[1:32:45] come away with the right conclusion.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; If there's something we need to tell
[1:32:49] them, we ought to tell them.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; If there's something they don't need to
[1:32:53] know,
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; this is not a time for triangulation.
[1:33:03] No,
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; this is not a time for drawing other
[1:33:06] people in
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; to our our beef, to our disagreement
[1:33:10] with someone,
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; to our opinion with someone.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; This is a in fact, this is the hour that
[1:33:17] we should I as brothers and sisters
[1:33:20] desire to to somehow cover. I don't mean
[1:33:25] cover sin, but I mean to to sort of act
[1:33:29] as a protection
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; so that everybody doesn't have to know.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Come on, sir.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; What if a hand would appear uh this
[1:33:40] morning and write on the wall over there
[1:33:42] between those windows? What if the hand
[1:33:45] of God were to write there today? Your
[1:33:48] soul is being weighed in the balance
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; and found wanting.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; It's not enough. It's not measuring up.
[1:33:59] Would you want God then to continue to
[1:34:01] write your sin on the wall there for
[1:34:03] everyone to read?
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Or would you rather take that as a
[1:34:07] warning from the Lord and go clean up
[1:34:09] your life?
[1:34:11] Come on.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; It won't do any good to tell one
[1:34:15] another. It'll only do good when we tell
[1:34:18] Listen, you know that little aunt that I
[1:34:21] tell you about, my little preacher aunt,
[1:34:23] gr sweet sister Isa May, I always say
[1:34:28] I'll show you a picture of her and I
[1:34:30] never do, but her hair was as she was
[1:34:32] kind of short and her hair was as tall
[1:34:34] as she was, as sweet as she could be.
[1:34:38] She got the Holy Ghost in a corn crib.
[1:34:42] God really filled her. Of course, we
[1:34:45] know she was doing God a service without
[1:34:48] being in his perfect will. But she
[1:34:50] Listen, that was an hour where when God
[1:34:52] did something for you, you wanted to do
[1:34:54] everything you possibly could for him.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; And sometimes people got out of their
[1:34:59] calling because of a desire to do
[1:35:01] something for the Lord. I'm going to let
[1:35:03] him sort that out. I tell you what I
[1:35:05] don't believe. I don't believe these
[1:35:07] message Pharisees,
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; who believe that God has no patience or
[1:35:14] no understanding for people who are
[1:35:16] doing God a service without his will. We
[1:35:18] all know that couldn't possibly be the
[1:35:20] truth. When brother Brandham looks at
[1:35:22] the woman in the prayer line and says,
[1:35:23] "I see you are a teacher of scripture.
[1:35:26] Go do what's in your heart." And some
[1:35:28] people say, "Well, that was a
[1:35:29] condemnation because he didn't tell her
[1:35:31] to obey the word. He told her to go do
[1:35:33] what was in her heart because he knew
[1:35:34] she was going to anyways.
[1:35:40] Not because she wanted to rebel, because
[1:35:43] that was what was in her heart to do to
[1:35:44] please the Lord. Be careful.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; I don't believe I don't believe I'm not
[1:35:48] looking for that in my life in this
[1:35:50] hour. But oh, I remember her and I
[1:35:54] remember how she sang those songs. I've
[1:35:57] told you before so many times and now
[1:36:00] I've done forgot it wasn't the song I
[1:36:02] usually mention and now I done forgot
[1:36:03] the song that I was going to Oh, you got
[1:36:05] to live your religion
[1:36:08] every
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; day.
[1:36:11] Every day. Every day. Every day.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; If I falter while I'm trying, don't be
[1:36:19] angry. Let me stay. Lord, I'd be willing
[1:36:22] to run.
[1:36:26] If God should point out to you your
[1:36:28] slapness,
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; you wouldn't want somebody else to go
[1:36:32] spread it all around the house.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; And I know now what I was going to say.
[1:36:39] There was a portion in one of those two
[1:36:41] songs that said, "If you see me fail," I
[1:36:46] don't remember if the word was fail or
[1:36:48] falter or fall or whatever, but it was
[1:36:50] along that line. She said, "If if if my
[1:36:53] brother and sister you be,
[1:36:57] go and don't tell another,
[1:37:00] tell Jesus
[1:37:03] on me." Wouldn't
[1:37:05] you like to think that somebody would go
[1:37:07] and tell the Lord
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; instead of telling somebody else
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; that's powerless to help,
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; powerless to change the situation?
[1:37:19] I'm preaching.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; It's too true. And so I've said to my
[1:37:25] own children, uh, don't don't overtell
[1:37:29] it.
[1:37:30] Don't exaggerate it.
[1:37:34] If you're going to say something, say
[1:37:36] the truth,
[1:37:38] the whole truth.
[1:37:41] Nothing but the truth.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Am I going to have to start swearing in
[1:37:46] my family?
[1:37:48] Is somebody going to have to start
[1:37:50] swearing you in because we can't trust
[1:37:52] you to have the integrity not to tell it
[1:37:57] just like it is? Come on.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Maybe find a way of slanting it a little
[1:38:02] bit so that you look better in the
[1:38:04] situation.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus have mercy, folks. The problem
[1:38:10] with that kind of busy bodiness is it
[1:38:12] keeps us out of the altar. It keeps us
[1:38:15] It busies our minds so that we can't see
[1:38:18] our need.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you that devil will try to
[1:38:24] turn families on one another.
[1:38:26] It'll try to destroy relationships
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; while somebody uh viciously tries to
[1:38:33] paint themselves the hero.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; You just let God I'll tell you uh maybe
[1:38:40] you need to go back to the vessel of
[1:38:42] misunderstanding.
[1:38:44] Maybe you need and I need to get a good
[1:38:46] dose of what it's like to be doing what
[1:38:48] we know to do and having it all to be
[1:38:51] misread.
[1:38:56] You can tell me. You can let me know
[1:38:57] when I'm out of the word here.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Misjudged
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; because somebody sees us through the
[1:39:03] tent of the glass
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; instead of for who? Aren't you glad
[1:39:08] you've got a papa who sees you for who
[1:39:11] you really are?
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Hey, he knows you're imperfect.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; He knows I fall short. He loves me
[1:39:17] anyway. He pours me from one vessel to
[1:39:20] the next to get a little more of junk
[1:39:22] and gunk and leaves and out of me
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; because one day he wants to put me in
[1:39:27] the crystal shalice.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Show everybody my color.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Show everybody how I taste. Show
[1:39:34] everybody how I smell. That's where
[1:39:36] we're headed.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Anybody here?
[1:39:39] the green tint of the glass would filter
[1:39:42] out some of the red light, causing the
[1:39:45] wine to look less vibrant and more
[1:39:47] subdued.
[1:39:49] So, the wine itself was not clearly
[1:39:52] visible while in this vessel of
[1:39:54] misunderstanding.
[1:39:55] The tinted glass distorted the actual
[1:39:58] color and the brightness and the true
[1:40:00] value of the wine that was being
[1:40:03] perfected. So this vessel of
[1:40:05] misunderstanding gives an offolor
[1:40:08] impression
[1:40:10] to observers.
[1:40:13] The intentional use of this darkly
[1:40:15] colored glass was to limit the
[1:40:17] penetration of light into the wine
[1:40:20] because wine will more perfectly ferment
[1:40:25] in the darkness,
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; in the aloneeness.
[1:40:32] in the darkness
[1:40:35] of the vessel of misunderstanding.
[1:40:37] If it were clear glass, the light would
[1:40:40] penetrate the glass and it would slow
[1:40:42] down and and perhaps stop
[1:40:46] the fermentation process. If the yeast
[1:40:48] dies, then the fermentation process is
[1:40:52] over. Anybody following me?
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; So, let's talk about the season of the
[1:40:57] vessel of misunderstanding.
[1:41:00] Uh, it's a season where God allows you
[1:41:02] to be misread.
[1:41:06] It's a season where God allows you to be
[1:41:08] misrepresented.
[1:41:10] It's a season where he doesn't always
[1:41:12] jump to your defense.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; How many of you know he can defend us
[1:41:17] whenever he's ready to?
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Whenever God wants to defend you, he can
[1:41:21] move heaven and earth to say, "Wait a
[1:41:23] minute. Get your mouth off of that one.
[1:41:24] That one's mine."
[1:41:26] But he doesn't always move that quickly
[1:41:28] when we're in the vessel of
[1:41:29] misunderstanding
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; because he wants us to hang in the hall
[1:41:33] of critics
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; so that one day we can hang in the hall
[1:41:38] of fame.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Anybody with me?
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Vanam said every masterpiece
[1:41:42] must hang first in the hall of critics.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; I was preaching one time in Beckley,
[1:41:48] West Virginia.
[1:41:51] I recently showed Benjamin the
[1:41:54] advertisement for that meeting. I found
[1:41:56] it when going through memorabilia for my
[1:41:59] museum.
[1:42:02] I'm kidding. But I do want to show you
[1:42:05] some of it on my 50th anniversary,
[1:42:09] but I found it. I don't know how I made
[1:42:12] it. Benjamin said, "Wow, Dad, you were
[1:42:15] in the top five then, not the top 10.
[1:42:20] I don't know how I made it to this great
[1:42:23] list of esteemed ministers here. I was a
[1:42:27] newbie, only been around the message for
[1:42:30] a few years and and yet was invited to
[1:42:34] speak this very special meeting and it
[1:42:35] was a it it was uh I was there two
[1:42:39] times, Easter meetings and also the
[1:42:42] annual camp meeting. And so the people
[1:42:46] had already experienced
[1:42:48] uh my style in the Easter meeting and
[1:42:53] and the pastor had invited me to come
[1:42:55] back.
[1:42:56] But on the on the night before he had
[1:43:02] royalty in the message to give his
[1:43:05] testimony of being with brother
[1:43:07] Brandham. And I'll just mention that it
[1:43:09] was a hunting uh a hunting story.
[1:43:15] And as he was sharing that testimony, he
[1:43:17] he stopped there toward the end and he
[1:43:19] began to to speak about all the newbies
[1:43:22] and the flashy Pentecostal anointed
[1:43:25] young men
[1:43:28] and how they would sit at the piano and
[1:43:30] grin and use their pinky to play and on
[1:43:36] and on and on. And he said, "Bring them
[1:43:38] all to the altar and make them feel
[1:43:40] good." and he said, "I've never heard of
[1:43:43] anybody
[1:43:44] uh being changed or or helped because
[1:43:47] they felt good."
[1:43:50] Well, the reality is is I'd rather feel
[1:43:52] good than feel bad.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; I don't know how deep the change is
[1:43:56] always, but it's good to feel the
[1:43:58] presence of the Lord. I wouldn't want to
[1:44:00] be where I couldn't
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; wouldn't want to be where I couldn't
[1:44:03] feel his presence. Anyway, everybody in
[1:44:05] the room knew
[1:44:09] who he was talking about. I was on the
[1:44:11] second row. Everybody was punching me.
[1:44:15] Everybody was turning around and leaning
[1:44:18] up and petting me on the shoulder.
[1:44:21] It was very obvious.
[1:44:24] Oh,
[1:44:26] you know, did it bother me? Well, it was
[1:44:28] a little hard to endure, but I just kept
[1:44:31] remembering
[1:44:33] Tonight
[1:44:36] is his night.
[1:44:40] Tomorrow night is my night.
[1:44:43] It should have been a different order.
[1:44:46] No, I didn't use the pull pit to fight
[1:44:48] back. I didn't have to because there was
[1:44:51] a Well, I had a deacon with me
[1:44:55] and we all know that uh upon his own
[1:44:57] confession, he didn't have enough of the
[1:44:59] Holy Ghost at that time. I'm not talking
[1:45:02] about Brother West, by the way.
[1:45:06] And he, as I got my stuff and came out,
[1:45:08] everybody came to me, rushing to me.
[1:45:11] Brother Shelley, I wouldn't have sat
[1:45:12] through that. Brother Shelley, I can't
[1:45:14] believe you had to endure that. Brother
[1:45:15] Shelley, that was so unfair, brother. On
[1:45:17] and on and on and on. And I said very,
[1:45:19] very little. I I almost made it to the
[1:45:22] car and and the deacon who was with me,
[1:45:24] his wife, he stepped out and he said, "I
[1:45:26] just tell you right now, I'll knock him
[1:45:28] out.
[1:45:32] He said, "I've already told him I don't
[1:45:34] have enough of the Holy Ghost." And he
[1:45:36] was right. And he said, "I believe the
[1:45:38] Lord to forgive me if I just knock this
[1:45:40] block off right now." I said, "Brother,
[1:45:43] that wouldn't be good." He said, "Many
[1:45:45] your elder and you you might really hurt
[1:45:47] him. And let's just leave this to the
[1:45:49] Lord."
[1:45:53] And so God gave me a message. And I
[1:45:55] preached I mean, he gave me the message
[1:45:57] before I got there. And I preached on
[1:45:59] David
[1:46:01] and how that uh he wanted he had this
[1:46:04] desire to go out and fight the giant and
[1:46:06] how brother Brandham said, you know, he
[1:46:08] he had never proven and tried the the
[1:46:12] ecclesiastical vest
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; of Saul's armor.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; All he knew is that God had been with
[1:46:20] him when he killed the bear. And God had
[1:46:24] been with him when he killed the lion.
[1:46:26] and God had been with him and and that
[1:46:29] was all he knew. He didn't know how to
[1:46:31] be uh elite. He didn't know how to be uh
[1:46:35] you know formal. He didn't know how to
[1:46:37] be ecclesiastical.
[1:46:40] All he knew is he had proven and tried
[1:46:42] that a rock in a sling was enough to
[1:46:46] bring the enemy down.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; And oh did God move.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; He moved. He moved in that service. The
[1:46:57] people began to scream out as God began
[1:47:00] to move over that service. It was a
[1:47:01] powerful meeting. And the next night,
[1:47:05] uh, another precious brother, uh, elite
[1:47:09] elite brother got up and it was his
[1:47:12] night and and I didn't know him all that
[1:47:14] well. And he said, "I want to start off
[1:47:15] by saying, I was here last night,
[1:47:18] greatly blessed." He give a little word
[1:47:20] about that. And I was here the night
[1:47:22] before.
[1:47:29] Everybody's holding their breath. And he
[1:47:31] said, "I would just like to say one
[1:47:33] thing." He said, "You can always tell."
[1:47:35] Brother Brandham said, "You can always
[1:47:37] tell which apple tree gives the best
[1:47:40] apples."
[1:47:42] Because he said, "All you have to do is
[1:47:44] look for all the chunks that have been
[1:47:45] thrown at that tree. They'll all be
[1:47:47] laying around the bottom." Well, I I was
[1:47:50] not a person who understood what chunks
[1:47:52] were, and I hadn't been around the
[1:47:54] message long enough to even know what
[1:47:56] Brother Ram was talking about, nor what
[1:47:58] this brother was talking about. And
[1:47:59] somebody saw the puzzled look on my
[1:48:01] face, and they leaned over and they
[1:48:02] said, "You know that you chuck a stick
[1:48:05] or a rock or you chuck a limb up in the
[1:48:07] top of that tree to knock down the the
[1:48:10] ripest, best looking apple at the top."
[1:48:13] Well, you you pick up the apple, but you
[1:48:15] leave the chunk
[1:48:17] that you've chucked up there or chuck.
[1:48:20] You you leave that around the bottom.
[1:48:22] So, if you see a bunch of look like
[1:48:24] misplaced rocks and limbs around a tree,
[1:48:27] you'll know that's some of the best
[1:48:28] apples in the orchard. And everybody's
[1:48:30] been throwing things at it
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; to knock down the apples.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; You You've got to learn. You got to
[1:48:41] learn that being misunderstood is part
[1:48:44] of life. It's not just part of preachers
[1:48:46] life.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; It's part of a Christian life.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; But let me listen very carefully what
[1:48:52] I'm going to say now. But here's what
[1:48:54] you don't want to do. And I'm not I'm
[1:48:56] not trying to be like Elvis Presley, but
[1:48:59] here's what you don't want to do. You
[1:49:01] don't want to get all shook up.
[1:49:04] Amen.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; Because if you get all shook up because
[1:49:09] somebody's misunderstood you, if you get
[1:49:12] all shook up because someone has
[1:49:14] misrepresented you to someone else,
[1:49:16] guess what happens? All that sediment.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; There it is.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; All those leaves, all those drags that
[1:49:23] have settled down to the bottom of that
[1:49:25] wine that will be left behind when the
[1:49:27] king pours it into another vessel. If
[1:49:30] you get all shook up
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; because somebody looked at me wrong and
[1:49:36] somebody had something to say about me
[1:49:38] and I can't even defend myself and I
[1:49:41] don't know what I'm going to do.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; You get all shook up. You're just going
[1:49:47] to stir the drags up. You're just going
[1:49:49] to stir the rotten stuff up again.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; Be still, my brother.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Be still, my sister. Yes.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Hang quietly in the hall of critics
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; because one day I believe it. I
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; I felt my tongue get thick when I said
[1:50:11] it because I believe one day the master
[1:50:14] will come for you.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; A
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; and when he knows that all of that other
[1:50:19] stuff,
[1:50:21] God allowed you to hang there. He
[1:50:24] allowed you to get the chunks thrown at
[1:50:26] you.
[1:50:27] He allowed you to be misunderstood. Not
[1:50:29] so you would come up with some kind of
[1:50:31] pseudo martyr complex
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; and you'd sing everybody hates me and
[1:50:37] nobody loves me and I'll just sit around
[1:50:39] and eat some worms.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; he didn't let you hang in the hall of
[1:50:46] critics so you could feel sorry for
[1:50:48] yourself.
[1:50:49] He let us hang in the hall of critics so
[1:50:52] that we could depend on him
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; and realize there's nothing good.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Help me preach.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; There's nothing good in me.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; There's nothing good in you.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; If I highly esteem you, it's because
[1:51:08] Christ is living in you. It's him that I
[1:51:12] esteem. It's your yieldedness to him
[1:51:15] that I celebrate. But it is not your
[1:51:18] talent. It is not your gift. It is not
[1:51:21] your stellar personality that attracts
[1:51:24] us.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; It's only the life of Christ.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; If there's anything good to say about
[1:51:33] you, it is he surrendered.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; She gave up.
[1:51:39] She quit stirring up the leaves and the
[1:51:42] drags. She let it all sh
[1:51:47] She let it all settle to the bottom so
[1:51:50] that when she was poured that final
[1:51:53] time,
[1:51:54] everything unlike him was left behind.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; This is a season where God allows.
[1:52:09] Somebody say allows.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; Allows.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; Could he stop them?
[1:52:14] Oh yes. Has he ever? He has.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; But that's only when he says enough is
[1:52:23] enough.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; We don't ever know when that day is
[1:52:26] coming. It's coming. In every situation
[1:52:29] that you're troubled over right now,
[1:52:31] that day is coming. Enough is enough.
[1:52:33] And God said, "No more.
[1:52:36] You'll deal with that devil no more.
[1:52:38] You'll deal with that thorn no more.
[1:52:40] You'll deal with that thing no more.
[1:52:42] It'll never harass you or torment you
[1:52:44] again. But until God says enough is
[1:52:47] enough,
[1:52:49] you'll be misunderstood,
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; both directions.
[1:52:58] Somebody will celebrate you when they
[1:53:00] ought to be calling you out,
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; and somebody will be calling you out
[1:53:06] when they ought to be celebrating you.
[1:53:08] It'll happen both ways. It's
[1:53:09] misunderstanding that works both ways.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; And I can just go ahead and tell you
[1:53:14] right now that if you think you're
[1:53:16] somebody,
[1:53:18] you've misunderstood your own self.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; If I think I'm somebody special, I've
[1:53:24] already misunderstood myself. It's only
[1:53:26] him.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; It's only his life. Somebody said, "You
[1:53:30] know, that just sounds nice, but do you
[1:53:31] really mean it? With everything that is
[1:53:34] within me, I mean it.
[1:53:38] I I'm tired of fluff.
[1:53:41] I'm tired of self-promotion.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of folks thinking they've got
[1:53:47] to have a title to serve the Lord
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; or to work in ministry for him.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Random said, "If you love me,
[1:53:59] just call me brother.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; I don't need anything beyond that.
[1:54:06] I don't have to be referred to uh uh
[1:54:09] every time you call my name by title.
[1:54:11] Just call me brother, he said. And he
[1:54:14] said one of the finest things that you
[1:54:17] could ever say to one another, just God
[1:54:18] bless you
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; and mean it from the from the bottom of
[1:54:22] who you are, I I would whether you
[1:54:25] deserve it or not, whether I deserve it
[1:54:28] or not, I would rather see God bless you
[1:54:30] than not bless you. Because sometimes
[1:54:33] he'll bless you right out of your in
[1:54:35] your uh uh independence. He'll bless you
[1:54:38] right out of your independence and right
[1:54:40] into a new fresh dependence on him. I've
[1:54:43] seen him do it that way, too.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. He'll allow you to be misread.
[1:54:49] He'll allow you to be misrepresent
[1:54:52] misrepresented. He'll allow you to be
[1:54:54] misunderstood. He'll allow you to be
[1:54:56] misjudged
[1:54:58] as long as you're hanging in the vessel
[1:55:00] of misunderstanding. But don't you
[1:55:02] forget it folks. This is a sacred
[1:55:03] season.
[1:55:05] This vessel of misunderstanding is a
[1:55:07] sacred season. You are being sifted not
[1:55:12] to be destroyed,
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; but to be promoted.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; And if that is the case, you're going to
[1:55:21] need both praise and correction.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; You're going to need to be celebrated.
[1:55:28] And you're going to need for somebody to
[1:55:31] be able to look you in the eye
[1:55:35] and tell you that is not the way it is.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; You are just wrong.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; That is not the way it is.
[1:55:49] But most of the time because we wear
[1:55:52] this uh you know this great uh uh trophy
[1:55:57] we we love to think of ourselves as
[1:55:59] non-confrontational.
[1:56:04] What I find is a lot of people who
[1:56:06] celebrate
[1:56:08] their their strength of of being
[1:56:11] non-confrontational
[1:56:13] are just really compromisers.
[1:56:17] They don't speak up for truth. You can
[1:56:21] speak up for truth without being
[1:56:22] religious.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; You can speak up for truth with
[1:56:27] sincerity of heart
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; and don't tell anybody to do anything
[1:56:31] that you aren't doing yourself
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; when it comes to the things of the
[1:56:35] kingdom of God.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Yeah, well, I know how to
[1:56:39] do it wrong. So, I've got lots of lots
[1:56:41] of advice to give to people." No, no,
[1:56:44] no, no, no.
[1:56:46] You've got to have relationship with
[1:56:48] somebody.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; My goodness.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; This is a sacred season where God is
[1:56:59] using this understanding to break and
[1:57:02] then crucify.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; If you think the breaking is all, if you
[1:57:07] think the crushing is all, hang on
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; because it's a crucifixion.
[1:57:14] The apostle said, "I die
[1:57:17] daily." He's referring to a total
[1:57:20] crucifixion, a total annihilation of his
[1:57:23] own will,
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; deeply surrendered.
[1:57:28] But you can't do that. I can't do that
[1:57:30] until I get out of my soul life. And
[1:57:32] yes, that's what I meant to say. Soul
[1:57:35] life,
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; mind, will, and emotion. You were a
[1:57:41] spirit uh before you were a body. Before
[1:57:44] you had a body to live in, you were a
[1:57:47] spirit first. And the breath of almighty
[1:57:51] God made you a living soul.
[1:57:54] And that soul is where the mind and the
[1:57:58] will and the emotions of a man resides.
[1:58:02] And it is in the mind and the will and
[1:58:04] the emotions of a man or a woman where
[1:58:07] we find our biggest hang-ups.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; It's stinking thinking.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; It's a lack of want to.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; You got to have the want to. You got to
[1:58:21] have the go through.
[1:58:24] You've got to keep the faith with
[1:58:27] everything that's in you.
[1:58:30] You can't just turn around because you
[1:58:34] get to feeling down.
[1:58:36] If you're going to make it through, then
[1:58:39] you got to have the want to. Sing again.
[1:58:43] You've got to have the want to.
[1:58:46] You've got to have the go through.
[1:58:49] You've got to keep the faith with
[1:58:52] everything that's in you.
[1:58:55] You can't just turn around because you
[1:58:59] get to feeling down.
[1:59:02] If you want to make it through,
[1:59:05] then you got to have the
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; want to.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; How important is the want to?
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; It's part of the thinking. And as a man
[1:59:15] thinkketh in his heart,
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; so he is.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; I'm determined to be faithful. I'm
[1:59:22] determined to hold out to the end.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; I'm determined for Jesus to be my
[1:59:27] priority.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; He has to be.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; It has to be. Everything else that we
[1:59:32] love and cherish could be gone tomorrow.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; Ask Job.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; God forbid. But we could wake up in the
[1:59:42] morning to the news
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; that there's nothing left but us and
[1:59:47] him.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; So quickly
[1:59:54] like a vapor. Don't you think that this
[1:59:57] daddy doesn't think about that when
[1:59:59] Joshua's driving so many miles back and
[2:00:02] forth to work? Don't you know that I
[2:00:06] think about the possibility of a call
[2:00:10] that would come shattering our life?
[2:00:15] Everything we cherish, everything we
[2:00:17] hold dear could be gone from us in a
[2:00:21] moment of time because life is just as a
[2:00:24] vapor appear on the glass and is quickly
[2:00:27] quickly it vanishes away. But holding on
[2:00:30] to Jesus is the best thing that anybody
[2:00:33] could ever do. And you don't know
[2:00:35] sometime you don't even realize sometime
[2:00:38] that he's all you need
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; until he's all you have.
[2:00:44] Weather these storms,
[2:00:47] these little storms.
[2:00:52] Weather them like a soldier of the most
[2:00:56] high God. Stay with me.
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; We're everyone battle scarred.
[2:01:05] We've everyone been through something.
[2:01:09] We've got to keep our eyes open so that
[2:01:12] we can see him.
[2:01:14] We continue to fill our lives with the
[2:01:17] things that add to our intellect
[2:01:21] perhaps but don't add to the spiritual
[2:01:23] part of who we are.
[2:01:27] Some of us are YouTube dummies.
[2:01:32] YouTube dummies.
[2:01:34] There are people so spiritually ignorant
[2:01:36] around this stuff
[2:01:39] that they'll they'll send you a a
[2:01:41] YouTube video that they hadn't even
[2:01:44] checked out real good for themselves.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; You better know what you pedal sir.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; You better know what you pass on.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Preach to us, brother.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; This season is a sacred season. It is
[2:02:00] not meant to punish you. It is meant to
[2:02:02] purify you.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's to break and crucify our ego.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "I didn't say eagle."
[2:02:14] I'm finding out that eagles have egos.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; Everybody does. Everybody has an ego.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; So, if you're using the word ego as
[2:02:24] though only some people have it, you're
[2:02:26] using the word and its meaning
[2:02:28] incorrectly.
[2:02:30] Everyone has an opinion of themselves,
[2:02:33] good, bad, or ugly. So, everybody in the
[2:02:35] room has an ego. It's not having an ego
[2:02:38] that's the problem. It's having an
[2:02:39] overinflated ego. It's having an ego
[2:02:42] that has been blown up with a bunch of
[2:02:44] hot air.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; A man who's not happy unless his wife is
[2:02:51] uh, you know, shuffling around behind
[2:02:52] him all the time telling him how
[2:02:54] wonderful he is. That's right.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; No wonder we're becoming like bags of
[2:03:02] hot air with no real virtue or value.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; Because we're finding people. We're
[2:03:08] drawing in. We're looking for people who
[2:03:11] will feed.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; Just a minute. Amen.
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; You ought to have stomach pain more
[2:03:20] often because you can just I don't I
[2:03:22] don't have time to play this morning. I
[2:03:24] don't have time to fluff this morning. I
[2:03:26] didn't come here today because I felt
[2:03:28] like it. I came here today because I had
[2:03:30] a responsibility and an assignment. I
[2:03:33] cannot expect God to continue to be
[2:03:35] faithful to me if I can't be faithful to
[2:03:37] him. It's a covenant that we're in. My
[2:03:40] my part of the covenant is just as
[2:03:42] important as his part of the covenant.
[2:03:44] It's an agreement. If one of us breaks
[2:03:47] the covenant, the covenant is broken
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; and has to be reinstituted
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; by repentance.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; And repentance is not a a New Year's
[2:03:58] resolution or turning over a new leaf.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; Repentance is doing it about faith.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; It's a complete 180.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; Too many people have made it a complete
[2:04:11] 360.
[2:04:13] And when they're through repenting,
[2:04:15] they're moving in the same direction
[2:04:17] they were before they repented.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; It's only half a rotation, folks.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; It's an about face.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; Just turn right around and say, "By the
[2:04:26] help and the grace of God, I'm walking
[2:04:29] the other way."
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; Those egos, uh, ego can be defined as a
[2:04:36] person's sense of self-importance.
[2:04:40] Everybody's got some some score
[2:04:44] of how important we think we are to
[2:04:47] God's economy.
[2:04:49] You'd be so surprised. You'd be so
[2:04:51] surprised. I have been surprised at how
[2:04:54] quickly God can take one down and put
[2:04:56] another up.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; And the world not not even miss a beat.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; My old granny used to say, "If if you
[2:05:05] die today, I got news for you. The sun
[2:05:08] will set tonight like it always has. And
[2:05:11] it'll come up in the morning like it
[2:05:13] always has. And there'll only be your
[2:05:15] yours. It'll only be yours. It'll only
[2:05:17] be those who you've had influence over
[2:05:19] their life that'll really even know
[2:05:21] you're gone. But the economy of God will
[2:05:23] just keep rocking on and he'll find
[2:05:26] somebody if anything was left undone. He
[2:05:28] knew that before he took you. And he
[2:05:30] will raise somebody up to finish the
[2:05:33] commission.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:36] I feel sorry for people who who who are
[2:05:40] always looking for somebody else to be
[2:05:42] their Joshua.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; This crazy Facebook is full of it.
[2:05:51] Every every foreign brother in the world
[2:05:55] has got them a Facebook pull pit
[2:06:01] and they can say the craziest most
[2:06:03] outlandish antirist
[2:06:06] things that any you'd be surprised at
[2:06:09] how ignorant spiritually enlightened
[2:06:12] people can be.
[2:06:14] I found most of the time I just let it
[2:06:17] roll by.
[2:06:19] Most of the time I just let it roll
[2:06:23] right by. Don't you think that's the
[2:06:25] best idea?
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; I I I want you to nod your little head
[2:06:30] in agreement.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; Don't you think that's usually the best
[2:06:33] idea?
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; Just let it roll right by you like you
[2:06:37] didn't even know it was there. But on
[2:06:40] occasion,
[2:06:42] there will be something said that I
[2:06:48] just can't
[2:06:51] not.
[2:06:59] Yesterday was that day.
[2:07:05] I was I was sitting on the steps of the
[2:07:08] pool
[2:07:10] trying to relax and pray.
[2:07:14] I I mistakenly grabbed my phone to make
[2:07:17] sure that I wasn't being summoned.
[2:07:21] And uh boy, it was downhill from there.
[2:07:27] So, I found this. I'm going to read it
[2:07:29] to you. You don't you won't know who
[2:07:30] said it.
[2:07:33] I'll find it. I'm looking for the right
[2:07:35] once I find the Oh, there it is.
[2:07:42] It's a picture of Brother Joseph and a
[2:07:46] picture of Brother Brandham with a
[2:07:48] pillar of fire over his head and brother
[2:07:51] Joseph's pointing his finger and this
[2:07:53] brother has said, "Pastor, put Brother
[2:07:56] Brandham back in the pull pit. This day
[2:07:59] this scripture is fulfilled in your
[2:08:02] ears." Well, that I've heard them say
[2:08:04] that so many times until it doesn't even
[2:08:08] register with me as being it doesn't
[2:08:10] even make sense.
[2:08:15] I believe in the tapes.
[2:08:18] I believe in the tape. I believe in
[2:08:20] hearing the message. I read it. I hear
[2:08:23] it. I study it. I take it back like a
[2:08:27] Berean to the scripture,
[2:08:30] searching the scripture to make sure
[2:08:32] these things are so because brother
[2:08:35] Brandham commended the Bereans.
[2:08:38] And then you've got something like this.
[2:08:40] He who has seen the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:08:43] has seen God Almighty. He who has seen
[2:08:47] Prophet William Mary and Brandom has
[2:08:49] seen the Lord Jesus Christ. He who has
[2:08:51] seen prophet William Marryiam Brham has
[2:08:54] seen prophet Joseph Marian Brham.
[2:08:57] Hebrews 13:8.
[2:09:00] And it goes on, they go on to tell us
[2:09:02] how that uh although they have preached
[2:09:06] for years, there's no eighth messenger.
[2:09:09] And now they've made one.
[2:09:12] Now it's his son.
[2:09:14] This is my response. I'd like to get it
[2:09:16] on record for you. I'm so sorry for you
[2:09:20] dear precious and sincere brothers out
[2:09:22] among the nations of the world.
[2:09:24] Unfortunately, you have no idea of the
[2:09:26] sin and corruption happening in this
[2:09:29] press play and obey movement here in the
[2:09:32] United States. Folks, that was gracious.
[2:09:35] I could have spoke about all of the
[2:09:37] illegitimate babies being born in the
[2:09:39] Brandom family while they keep stressing
[2:09:42] press play. Come on. If brother Brandham
[2:09:45] could see the worldliness and compromise
[2:09:47] in so many in this headquarters sect, he
[2:09:51] would weep. If he could see how far so
[2:09:54] many have fallen away from the holiness
[2:09:56] and truth of the message he brought and
[2:09:58] have returned to paganism and idolatry,
[2:10:00] he would raise his voice against it.
[2:10:03] There is no biblical mandate or
[2:10:05] precedent for this. Brother Joseph is
[2:10:08] equal to or the successor of brother
[2:10:10] Brandham doctrine. It is anti-word
[2:10:13] as is brother Brandham as brother and as
[2:10:16] brother Brandham described this man
[2:10:18] worship in his time. You are now making
[2:10:21] them both Antichrist.
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; We just had to make every sigh. Listen
[2:10:26] carefully. We just had to make every
[2:10:28] sigh, every partial sentence and every
[2:10:32] proud dad comment. Thus sayaith the
[2:10:34] Lord. In our enthusiasm, we just had to
[2:10:38] make everything he said equal to and on
[2:10:41] the same level with the Bible. Now many
[2:10:44] call it all the word, even his
[2:10:46] greetings, his opinions, and every
[2:10:49] personal comment. God help us all. We
[2:10:53] should have listened to him. We should
[2:10:54] have let him be a man. We should have
[2:10:57] diligently taken everything back to the
[2:10:59] word. We should have kept his absolute
[2:11:01] as our absolute. Now there's more
[2:11:04] confusion and even more ammunition for
[2:11:07] the critics. Our Joshua, this is why I
[2:11:10] read the whole thing in the first place.
[2:11:12] It's it it uh the the comment came out
[2:11:15] of my mind always looking for Joshua.
[2:11:17] Our Joshua is the Holy Ghost.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; He's leading us back to the Bible
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; which we can now understand because God
[2:11:25] cared enough to send a messenger. I pray
[2:11:28] that somehow it is not too late for many
[2:11:30] to correct their past. I know you will
[2:11:32] now likely attack me, but I'm so used to
[2:11:34] it by now. I usually write and then
[2:11:37] delete and never post because it pains
[2:11:39] me to even say such things.
[2:11:43] It's the least of what they what they
[2:11:45] everyone looking for a chief apostle
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; or an eighth messenger.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; And the reality is if you've received
[2:11:54] the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; he said our Holy Ghost is the Joshua.
[2:12:00] Our Joshua is the Holy Ghost. God
[2:12:03] restored the truth of his word and now
[2:12:06] the Holy Ghost leads us back to the
[2:12:08] absolute.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; It's the pattern of the scripture.
[2:12:13] That's right.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; Not a one-man resurrection tent meeting
[2:12:16] and an airplane ride across the country,
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; but a many membered body
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; who will stand with their messenger and
[2:12:25] become the final voice of God to the
[2:12:29] age.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; Not prophet Jr.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; But the final voice of God today.
[2:12:40] Somebody said, "We don't even know what
[2:12:41] you're talking about." I realize some of
[2:12:43] you don't, but you can't always live in
[2:12:45] a bubble. And if you don't hear this
[2:12:48] from time to time, you will not fully
[2:12:51] appreciate what God has done for us.
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; If you don't have a clue of what I'm
[2:12:58] talking about, you can say, "Thank you,
[2:13:00] Lord, for putting me in a bubble.
[2:13:06] Thank God for putting me in a refuge
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; where I don't have to deal with all of
[2:13:11] that.
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; Spits and sputters and it all inspired.
[2:13:16] And folks, I'm telling you something. I
[2:13:19] don't have time for that very often. I'm
[2:13:22] too busy trying to get my own life in
[2:13:27] order with the one who called me
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; so that I can be faithful to do what he
[2:13:32] told me I would do. Amen.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; To help get this bride ready to be out
[2:13:36] of here.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; Everything we need. The word is
[2:13:40] restored. The wedding garment is is
[2:13:42] prepared. We've just got to change
[2:13:45] clothes.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; But you can't put on the word.
[2:13:51] Listen,
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; if you've got all this other stuff going
[2:13:55] on,
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; if you are sitting here this morning and
[2:13:58] you think this is just another church
[2:14:00] like one down the road or across the
[2:14:02] hill there, you have absolutely missed
[2:14:04] the revelation.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; I don't even know. I I'm thankful you're
[2:14:09] here, but I don't even know why you are
[2:14:11] here.
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't know. I wouldn't be able to
[2:14:16] understand.
[2:14:17] I assume you're here because you've
[2:14:19] recognized that there's a commission and
[2:14:21] a mandate. It doesn't make us
[2:14:24] more special than anybody else.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; But every called person has a special
[2:14:32] unique
[2:14:34] commission.
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; You do. I do. That's why we say special.
[2:14:40] Not because you're more special than
[2:14:42] someone else, but simply because you
[2:14:44] weren't called to just go with the flow.
[2:14:47] I'm going to tell you something. My
[2:14:48] toenail, no part of who I am is
[2:14:52] satisfied with going with the flow.
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; I just can't do it. I've tried to do it.
[2:14:58] I can't do it. That ecclesiastical vest
[2:15:01] will not fit me. I cannot wear it. I
[2:15:05] want to get out of here.
[2:15:08] and I want you to get out of here.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; So, everybody has a sense of
[2:15:14] self-importance which often leads to an
[2:15:17] inflated view of one's own abilities and
[2:15:19] a tendency to be self-centered
[2:15:24] or arrogant.
[2:15:26] Ego is often associated with negative
[2:15:28] traits like arrogance, narcissism, and a
[2:15:32] need to feel superior.
[2:15:35] my revel. I understand more than you
[2:15:38] understand. So you listen to me. No, you
[2:15:40] take it back to the word for yourself.
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; This is not this is not one of those
[2:15:50] needs to feel superior. Don't you let
[2:15:52] that get in you. You don't have to be
[2:15:54] super dad. Just be a godly dad.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; You don't have to be a super mom.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; Just be a godly mom.
[2:16:05] You don't have to always get it right.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; Just understand it's not your rightness,
[2:16:10] it's his uprightness.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; But we have to have a madeup mind.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; And we can't drop our babies.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; We cannot drop our babies.
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; We cannot feel good about ourselves if
[2:16:28] we are crippling the next generation.
[2:16:33] If we're teaching them, it doesn't
[2:16:34] matter
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; whether or not you come to church.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; If we're teaching them, it doesn't
[2:16:40] matter whether you're on time.
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; If we're teaching them, it doesn't
[2:16:44] matter how much attention you pay to the
[2:16:46] pastor.
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; If we're teaching them your physical
[2:16:51] posture in church, doesn't matter.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; If we're teaching them this is a place
[2:16:57] to trim your fingernails,
[2:16:59] [Music]
[2:17:02] We are crippling the next generation
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; and what we barely celebrate they will
[2:17:08] absolutely ignore.
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; Ego is often associated with these
[2:17:16] negative I won't read it again. I don't
[2:17:18] think I can.
[2:17:20] For example, a person with a big ego
[2:17:23] might constantly boast about their
[2:17:26] superior knowledge or their grasp of a
[2:17:30] particular subject or their personal
[2:17:33] achievements.
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; This is usually accomplished by
[2:17:37] belittling.
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; That means to make somebody else feel
[2:17:42] little. badgering,
[2:17:45] which is almost like just constantly
[2:17:48] punching somebody. Just
[2:17:51] just thinking that your brother or
[2:17:54] sister is the is the is the devil that
[2:17:56] you're booing and just constantly
[2:18:03] nagging.
[2:18:06] Just so you'll know, a nagging is not a
[2:18:09] gender specific
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; behavior. Amen.
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; All of us are capable of nagging.
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; Although the Bible does speak of a
[2:18:21] brawling woman and it doesn't speak
[2:18:22] perhaps of a brawling man,
[2:18:29] but that don't mean a man can't brawl.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; You just get a couple beers in here.
[2:18:33] You'll see how you can brawl.
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; You get them higher than a kite and see
[2:18:39] how you brawl.
[2:18:41] Hello.
[2:18:44] This is usually accomplished by
[2:18:45] beliting, belittling, badgering, or
[2:18:48] bullying. Let me tell you something. The
[2:18:50] church is full of bullies.
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; The church is full of bullies.
[2:18:58] &gt;&gt; Don't you just want to say to every one
[2:18:59] of them, "You've met your match."
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what you wanted to do in
[2:19:04] school? How many of you longed for the
[2:19:06] courage to just look at him and say, "I
[2:19:08] ain't going anywhere.
[2:19:11] You knock me down, I'll get up.
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; You're not going to force me in or force
[2:19:19] me out.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; I have just as much right to be here as
[2:19:23] you do.
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; There's only one way to deal with a
[2:19:27] bully, and that's stand your ground.
[2:19:31] &gt;&gt; Quit being a wishy-washy.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; My family's harassing me and giving me a
[2:19:37] hard time about what I believe. Stand
[2:19:40] your ground.
[2:19:43] Yes, sir.
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; Tell them, "I can't expect you to
[2:19:46] understand it. It has not been revealed
[2:19:48] to you.
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; But neither can I apologize for the fact
[2:19:52] that God has made it a reality to me."
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; So, let us fellowship. Let us have our
[2:20:00] enjoyment around things that we can
[2:20:02] agree on. and and don't make my religion
[2:20:06] always the subject of the dinner table
[2:20:09] conversation
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; because you won't talk me out of it.
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; Nobody talk me into it and nobody will
[2:20:18] talk me out of it. Hallelujah.
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; My eyes are open because of his eyes.
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; And I'm not budging.
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; Don't you do like they do because you're
[2:20:29] with them. Don't you judge and condemn
[2:20:33] what they do because you're with them.
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; Just be salty and full of light
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; and show them that you are not a
[2:20:41] religious fanatic.
[2:20:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. Glory
[2:20:45] to God.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; Well, uh, Uncle Uncle Lamar,
[2:20:55] notice I didn't use my first name.
[2:20:58] Uncle Lamar,
[2:21:02] would you like rice or potatoes?
[2:21:06] Well, praise God. Glory to God.
[2:21:08] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Woo. I'll
[2:21:11] take rice.
[2:21:14] &gt;&gt; Now, that might be slightly exaggerated,
[2:21:18] but I've been around folks like that.
[2:21:22] You You can't be a light when you look
[2:21:25] like you need
[2:21:27] a straight jacket.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; You got to use some good sense in this.
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you that,
[2:21:43] you know, I I believe as much as anybody
[2:21:45] believes, but that turns me off.
[2:21:51] I find most of the time you don't even
[2:21:53] have to speak to the waitress about your
[2:21:56] faith or or
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; because she'll become it won't take her
[2:22:01] too long. She'll begin to realize you're
[2:22:04] not the average table
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; just because you were kind,
[2:22:11] &gt;&gt; just because you showed patience,
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; just because you exercised this sense of
[2:22:18] understanding what it's like to be under
[2:22:21] pressure.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; Don't stiffer of a tip.
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:30] after you've told her who your pastor
[2:22:32] is.
[2:22:35] &gt;&gt; Especially then,
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; do like do like we have done. Make them
[2:22:42] fight for for who section you sit in.
[2:22:47] Make them follow you out to the car
[2:22:49] telling you you must have made a
[2:22:51] mistake.
[2:22:52] Not only has that happened to me several
[2:22:54] times, but I actually had a waitress
[2:22:56] follow me out to the to the vegetable
[2:22:59] and she said, "This is so embarrassing.
[2:23:02] I cannot believe that I'm going to do
[2:23:04] this." She said, "But I know you very
[2:23:06] well and I know that you usually leave a
[2:23:09] tip." And she said, "There was a glitch
[2:23:11] in this iPad."
[2:23:14] And she said, "It is not because I want
[2:23:16] to chase you for a tip. It is simply
[2:23:19] because I know that you intended to
[2:23:22] leave a tip and did not. Was I offended?
[2:23:25] Absolutely not. I said, "Well, I sure
[2:23:28] put the same tip that I always put on
[2:23:31] here." She said, "I I thought you
[2:23:32] probably did, but she said it somehow
[2:23:35] glitched out. Maybe I didn't hit the
[2:23:37] okay after I'd signed my name and put
[2:23:39] put in the amount. I don't know." That
[2:23:41] didn't offend me. it it because I know
[2:23:44] her and because I know things about her
[2:23:46] life because we've talked to one
[2:23:48] another. We have a little bit of a
[2:23:49] relationship. It actually made me feel
[2:23:51] good
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; that she knew that it is my intention to
[2:23:55] make her life $15 easier,
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; not $15 harder.
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; You do that, brother sister. Brother
[2:24:05] Brandham taught us to do that.
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Well, I couldn't afford
[2:24:09] that. Eat it home then."
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:15] Add a little water to the soup and keep
[2:24:16] going.
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; We've all been there.
[2:24:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, I'm on a roll, brother. You
[2:24:24] should have probably just stepped in and
[2:24:25] preached this morning. You knew I had a
[2:24:27] belly ache.
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; Here's how to get rid of that ego thing.
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; This quote was from last Sunday, and I
[2:24:38] didn't read it, so I will today. And I'm
[2:24:39] hurrying along now. It's 123. I want to
[2:24:42] want I want there to be somebody here
[2:24:44] Tuesday night, so I better stop. Uh,
[2:24:47] paragraph 38, greater than Solomon is
[2:24:49] here, Tucson, the church needs tonight,
[2:24:54] not a soft hybrid something.
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; I prayed to the Lord this morning. I
[2:25:00] didn't know he was going to answer this
[2:25:01] quick, but I prayed to the Lord this
[2:25:03] morning and I said, Lord, I don't want
[2:25:05] to become that that I can't remember the
[2:25:08] exact words. Brother Daniel will
[2:25:10] remember the exact words of the quote,
[2:25:11] but that kind old priest. What was the
[2:25:14] doi?
[2:25:16] I said, "Oh Lord,
[2:25:20] I don't want to become that old Dodie
[2:25:23] priest
[2:25:26] who turns his head
[2:25:29] while his sons are committing adultery
[2:25:31] down there in the I'm not referring
[2:25:33] directly to my children because
[2:25:37] I hope they want to live. I hope they
[2:25:39] like breath and life
[2:25:43] more than this.
[2:25:46] But but I don't want to be the dirty old
[2:25:48] priest who says, "Y'all ought to do
[2:25:50] different. I wish y'all would do
[2:25:51] different. I think you really ought to
[2:25:52] do different." And turns his head while
[2:25:55] they continue to lay down and commit
[2:25:57] fornication in the doorway of the temple
[2:25:59] where doorway of the tabernacle where
[2:26:01] they come to bring their offerings
[2:26:03] before the Lord and prostituting the the
[2:26:06] women out. And and uh he just he he just
[2:26:09] was old and fat. I've got that part down
[2:26:11] pat.
[2:26:14] But he became sodi that and and it's
[2:26:16] happened through the script. Lord, I
[2:26:17] said to God this morning in in the
[2:26:20] shower. I don't guess you need to know
[2:26:21] that. But I said, "Oh Lord, please don't
[2:26:24] let me become that. Give me wisdom. Give
[2:26:28] me grace. Give me a kind heart. Let me
[2:26:30] show people how much I love them. And
[2:26:32] when they need to be corrected, give me
[2:26:35] courage." Amen.
[2:26:38] &gt;&gt; The church needs tonight not a soft
[2:26:41] hybrid, something soft and flabby like
[2:26:43] the church is. Just make a confession,
[2:26:45] be baptized, you're a Christian. He said
[2:26:48] this, this is some of the most important
[2:26:50] things.
[2:26:51] &gt;&gt; To be a Christian
[2:26:54] is self-denial.
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you something. For
[2:26:58] some of us, the only way we'll learn
[2:27:00] self-denial is to hang out a little
[2:27:02] while longer in the vessel of
[2:27:04] misunderstanding where people can't see
[2:27:07] what's really going on on the inside of
[2:27:09] us. All they can see is their
[2:27:12] perception.
[2:27:17] &gt;&gt; He said, "To be a Christian is
[2:27:19] self-denial.
[2:27:21] Deny yourself. Take up your cross.
[2:27:24] Follow me daily." Today it's so soft and
[2:27:28] people call themselves Christians when
[2:27:30] it used to mean death to confess Christ
[2:27:34] and you had to depend on him daily for
[2:27:37] everything you had need of.
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; This season, this sacred season not only
[2:27:45] comes to break and crucify our ego, but
[2:27:49] it comes to purify and refine our
[2:27:53] motives.
[2:27:55] Purify is a broader term encompassing
[2:27:58] the removal of impurities to make
[2:28:01] something cleaner, more wholesome or
[2:28:04] morally acceptable. God said, "I'm going
[2:28:06] to use the misunderstandings
[2:28:10] to purify,
[2:28:13] to make you cleaner, to make you more
[2:28:16] wholesome,
[2:28:17] &gt;&gt; to make you morally acceptable. Not just
[2:28:20] in the eyes of people but in the eyes of
[2:28:23] the one who matters. He said to purify
[2:28:25] and refine. Refine typically refers to
[2:28:29] the removal of impurities also but from
[2:28:32] a substance to improve its quality and
[2:28:36] usability.
[2:28:38] Usability.
[2:28:40] Quality and usability. Somebody say with
[2:28:44] messability.
[2:28:47] The first things to go perhaps are the
[2:28:50] things that make us uh immoral, the
[2:28:52] things the choices that are bad, that
[2:28:54] are not righteous. Uh we are being
[2:28:56] purified. But when God starts refining
[2:28:59] what's left,
[2:29:01] he gets down into that uh uh uh uh
[2:29:04] separating us from the things that
[2:29:07] hinder our usability.
[2:29:11] And and I want to just talk to you from
[2:29:12] a from a from a pap's heart.
[2:29:18] Your usability is as valuable
[2:29:22] as anything there is about you.
[2:29:25] &gt;&gt; If God needs something done and he can't
[2:29:28] trust you to do it, you're not very
[2:29:32] usable.
[2:29:33] If God needs something said and he can't
[2:29:36] depend on me to hear it and say it, then
[2:29:40] I am greatly affecting my usability.
[2:29:43] &gt;&gt; I want to be purified from anything that
[2:29:47] would keep me from being the first that
[2:29:51] he would call on.
[2:29:57] &gt;&gt; Maybe not for the world, but for you
[2:30:00] people.
[2:30:01] I I would desire to be the first one
[2:30:04] that God would send to you.
[2:30:08] &gt;&gt; I don't want anything to hinder my
[2:30:09] usability. And and here's the pat part.
[2:30:13] One of the things that I have observed
[2:30:16] through the years that can affect your
[2:30:19] usability in a particular situation more
[2:30:21] than anything else is if you already
[2:30:23] have an opinion.
[2:30:27] And who doesn't have 11 dozens of those
[2:30:30] laying around at all times?
[2:30:36] Now, the Bob Jones that I knew was not a
[2:30:39] perfect man.
[2:30:42] In fact, I've not known very many
[2:30:44] perfect men, especially the ones that
[2:30:46] God's used in my life.
[2:30:49] I used to think that Brother Brandon was
[2:30:51] a perfect man, and I learned that he was
[2:30:52] not.
[2:30:54] He was a man mightily, greatly used of
[2:30:58] God, but flawed
[2:31:00] like every other vessel that God has
[2:31:02] ever used in the book. And if we would
[2:31:05] have been reading the book along with
[2:31:09] the books,
[2:31:11] we would have understood
[2:31:13] that if Moses was human,
[2:31:17] perhaps
[2:31:19] if Paul was perhaps,
[2:31:22] but we somehow missed that. But when God
[2:31:24] teaches you that, it actually becomes
[2:31:26] one of the greatest freedoms. I'm
[2:31:28] telling you, it's such a freedom when
[2:31:30] you know that your flaw, your human
[2:31:33] weakness, your your tendency to see
[2:31:35] things uh a little different than others
[2:31:38] because of your circumstances. When you
[2:31:40] find out that these things are not going
[2:31:43] to disqualify you, he may have to
[2:31:45] sharpen them, he may have to hone them,
[2:31:47] he may have to pull some of them out by
[2:31:49] the root, but they're not going to
[2:31:50] hinder you from being usable. I'm
[2:31:52] telling you, it it'll really set you
[2:31:55] free.
[2:31:56] &gt;&gt; And Bob used to tell this story that he
[2:31:59] had this invitation to to to a to speak
[2:32:02] at a particular large conference where
[2:32:04] he felt like he could actually be a
[2:32:06] blessing and he felt like that he might
[2:32:08] actually be able to to say something
[2:32:10] that others wouldn't say,
[2:32:14] but he had to tell them no.
[2:32:21] I read it where it had been written the
[2:32:23] first time, but I had an opportunity to
[2:32:25] sit with him. I had many opportunities
[2:32:27] to sit with him. And in one of those
[2:32:29] particular times, I asked him
[2:32:33] what was the real route. He said, "Well,
[2:32:35] the real root was as I as you read, I
[2:32:38] already had an opinion about that place.
[2:32:41] I already had an opinion about the
[2:32:43] pastor and about the congregation and
[2:32:46] what the direction they were going in.
[2:32:48] And I desperately wanted to release a
[2:32:50] word that would help them correct
[2:32:54] their direction. But the opinion, I
[2:32:56] found that the opinion that I had was so
[2:32:59] strong that as I begin to think of of
[2:33:02] preparing what I would say if I were
[2:33:04] there, I couldn't get that opinion
[2:33:07] separated
[2:33:09] from how I would present.
[2:33:12] So I didn't go. And I said, well, how is
[2:33:15] it that you came? This was party. I
[2:33:17] didn't read. I said, "How was it that
[2:33:19] you came to have such a strong opinion
[2:33:21] about them?" He said, "I listened to
[2:33:24] another person."
[2:33:27] I had never been there and at that time
[2:33:29] I had never invited had never been
[2:33:31] invited to be there. I had no thought of
[2:33:34] ever being invited to go there. So I sat
[2:33:38] and listened to another person slime
[2:33:41] that ministry and that preacher and tell
[2:33:44] all the dirt and bring up all the
[2:33:46] skeletons and say all the things that he
[2:33:48] possibly could. I should have stopped
[2:33:50] him. I could have stopped him.
[2:33:54] But I thought, well, I'll never be
[2:33:55] invited there. I'll never have an
[2:33:57] opportunity to go there. So there's no
[2:33:58] need for me to worry about, you know,
[2:34:00] here. It's not going to affect me. But
[2:34:02] he said, 'I found uh years later when
[2:34:05] the invitation came, it did affect me.
[2:34:07] So I'm telling you, not only as your
[2:34:09] pastor, but as a pap, you will greatly
[2:34:13] affect your usability in a situation
[2:34:18] if you already have an opinion
[2:34:20] &gt;&gt; about that person.
[2:34:26] &gt;&gt; And if an opinion is widespread,
[2:34:29] who's going to help them?
[2:34:35] Who's going to help him?
[2:34:38] &gt;&gt; I'm going to say that again. Who's going
[2:34:41] to help him?
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; If we all have such a strong opinion,
[2:34:47] who could God use?
[2:34:49] &gt;&gt; Only a person who is able to climb up
[2:34:51] above their opinion.
[2:34:54] Because if you're if the situation is
[2:34:56] dire, if the situation is serious, you
[2:34:59] can't afford to go in his name
[2:35:04] &gt;&gt; with a word of wisdom
[2:35:08] mixed with your opinion.
[2:35:12] &gt;&gt; Because you'll do more damage than good.
[2:35:14] &gt;&gt; I've tell you folks, if there's one
[2:35:17] thing I've learned over the last some
[2:35:19] years about the prophetic is this. It's
[2:35:22] got to be pure. Amen.
[2:35:24] &gt;&gt; It's got to be without opinion.
[2:35:27] &gt;&gt; It's got to not even one part of it can
[2:35:30] be based on what you know or what you've
[2:35:34] heard or what you think
[2:35:37] &gt;&gt; or you will destroy someone. And not
[2:35:41] only will you destroy someone, you will
[2:35:43] destroy your usability
[2:35:46] &gt;&gt; to ever be able to help them again.
[2:35:53] Lord, purify us and then refine us
[2:35:57] &gt;&gt; and then refine us again.
[2:36:00] &gt;&gt; Aba also uses this season of
[2:36:02] misunderstanding
[2:36:05] to anchor you in God's approval
[2:36:09] rather than in the approval
[2:36:12] of men.
[2:36:14] If you're depending on someone else's
[2:36:16] attab boy,
[2:36:22] it's better to just remain being
[2:36:25] misunderstood
[2:36:27] than to depend on someone else's
[2:36:29] approval, adab boy, vindication.
[2:36:36] Well, I feel good because of my name was
[2:36:38] called in the service, you know.
[2:36:42] &gt;&gt; Don't
[2:36:48] I've been to services not too far from
[2:36:50] here
[2:36:52] where my name was called in the service
[2:36:54] as though I was sort of being lifted up
[2:36:56] or honored in some way.
[2:36:59] Maybe it meant something to someone who
[2:37:01] was with me. Maybe my church people were
[2:37:03] blessed because I was
[2:37:06] called out.
[2:37:09] But it didn't do a thing for me. Do you
[2:37:12] know why? because I knew not only was my
[2:37:15] name being called in the service, my
[2:37:18] name would be called after the service.
[2:37:22] And what was being said in the service
[2:37:25] wouldn't match what was being said after
[2:37:27] the service. So wouldn't you just rather
[2:37:30] be a fly on the wall
[2:37:32] &gt;&gt; instead of somebody recognized by name?
[2:37:36] Can Come on, folks.
[2:37:39] They will
[2:37:41] embrace you to your face,
[2:37:46] eat you alive
[2:37:49] when you're gone.
[2:37:52] And I'm dumb enough, thank God,
[2:37:56] to actually hide people often like that.
[2:38:03] That means you don't post a picture with
[2:38:05] them. You don't call their name in
[2:38:07] conversation.
[2:38:08] You don't mention their name in your
[2:38:10] pull pit because to do so would be to
[2:38:13] out the fact
[2:38:16] that they're two-faced
[2:38:18] and can't be trusted.
[2:38:24] Brother, I could be an expert
[2:38:28] on the vessel of misunderstanding
[2:38:31] and yet I would rather God send me back
[2:38:33] there again and again and again
[2:38:37] than to let something hinder me in the
[2:38:40] end of my life
[2:38:42] &gt;&gt; that would unravel and undo any good
[2:38:44] that I might have accomplished with his
[2:38:46] help in the earlier part of my life. I
[2:38:48] hope you can hear my heart.
[2:38:50] It can best be described as a season of
[2:38:53] distorted perception.
[2:38:56] We're not looking for man's approval.
[2:38:58] We're looking for God's approval.
[2:39:01] &gt;&gt; Remember, God spoke to my heart very
[2:39:03] directly, very plainly, and he and he
[2:39:05] said, "The only way I I mean, maybe I've
[2:39:07] never told this whole part, but I will
[2:39:09] now that I've opened it up. I always
[2:39:12] tell the end part, but I don't usually
[2:39:14] tell the beginning part." But I was
[2:39:16] praying about a particular thing that
[2:39:17] God would use me in a particular way.
[2:39:19] And the Lord answered by saying, "The
[2:39:21] only way that I can answer that prayer
[2:39:25] is to make you a gazing stock." And then
[2:39:28] before I had a chance to say yes, he
[2:39:31] said, "And I'm going to make you
[2:39:34] a gazing stop."
[2:39:37] Now, who in the world would want to be a
[2:39:39] gazing stop? I don't think that means
[2:39:42] look to you to follow your example.
[2:39:45] I think it means look to you and
[2:39:47] carefully scrutinize you and everything
[2:39:49] you do and everything you wear and
[2:39:51] everything you say and they'll
[2:39:53] misunderstand your your thoughts about
[2:39:55] the gifts and they'll not not too many
[2:39:58] years ago I preached here at camp
[2:39:59] meeting a service about the secret power
[2:40:02] of the bride and I spoke about the power
[2:40:04] of praying in tongues.
[2:40:07] Someone sitting in that service went
[2:40:08] home and told their whole church and
[2:40:10] family that I I was preaching if you
[2:40:13] didn't speak in tongues, you didn't have
[2:40:15] the Holy Ghost.
[2:40:18] I didn't know that night I was in the
[2:40:20] vessel of misunderstanding. I never said
[2:40:22] that because I never believe that.
[2:40:26] &gt;&gt; But what I do believe is that that if
[2:40:28] you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:40:30] sometime or another, he said
[2:40:33] &gt;&gt; you will.
[2:40:35] So if you haven't, you might ought to
[2:40:38] consider the fact that it's available to
[2:40:40] you.
[2:40:44] &gt;&gt; Because if it's a weapon
[2:40:46] &gt;&gt; and you're not using it in the battle,
[2:40:49] &gt;&gt; come on.
[2:40:53] &gt;&gt; It's every it's almost every service
[2:40:56] that someone, you know, so quickly can
[2:41:01] take one thing.
[2:41:02] &gt;&gt; That's right. But you've got to be
[2:41:04] willing to and and you two in the pew,
[2:41:07] you've got to be willing to withstand
[2:41:09] that
[2:41:11] &gt;&gt; or you're not usable.
[2:41:13] Who who would who would sign up? If God
[2:41:16] said tonight, the only way I can answer
[2:41:18] your prayer is to make you a gazing
[2:41:21] stock. Who would sign up?
[2:41:25] A few.
[2:41:29] A few.
[2:41:32] God bless you because you're needed.
[2:41:37] You're not being seen accurately. Your
[2:41:39] words, your motives or callings are
[2:41:41] viewed with suspicion because some
[2:41:43] people have the gift of suspicion
[2:41:44] instead of the gift of discernment.
[2:41:48] And don't you don't you uh
[2:41:49] misunderstand. There are people that I
[2:41:51] don't trust.
[2:41:54] And there are people in this room that I
[2:41:57] don't trust, but I love them.
[2:42:01] I love them. And I know the same God who
[2:42:04] made you or me or anybody else
[2:42:06] trustworthy.
[2:42:10] Don't you want to be in relation with
[2:42:12] somebody that you can believe what comes
[2:42:14] out of their mouth?
[2:42:16] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be a wonderful thing,
[2:42:17] Sister Flo, to be able to have
[2:42:18] fellowship with people who you could
[2:42:20] believe what they say?
[2:42:24] &gt;&gt; I would love that.
[2:42:26] But the reality is you're not always in
[2:42:28] a position to do that. But don't give up
[2:42:30] on people.
[2:42:31] &gt;&gt; Love them anyway. Pray for them anyway.
[2:42:33] Ask God to help them anyway.
[2:42:36] &gt;&gt; Don't treat them differently because you
[2:42:38] can't trust them.
[2:42:40] &gt;&gt; Treat them the best way you can. Don't
[2:42:41] go into business with them.
[2:42:46] &gt;&gt; Don't take everything they say as the
[2:42:48] gospel record.
[2:42:52] &gt;&gt; But don't stop loving them. Lord have
[2:42:55] mercy.
[2:42:57] That's the only thing that's going to
[2:43:00] keep some people holding on by a thread
[2:43:03] is for you to show them a little bit of
[2:43:05] love.
[2:43:05] &gt;&gt; You do that. We must. Might not be as
[2:43:09] much as they want or need, but I want to
[2:43:12] tell you something. If you can love your
[2:43:14] enemy,
[2:43:16] &gt;&gt; you can love a fallen brother
[2:43:20] &gt;&gt; or a fallen sister. Woo.
[2:43:24] the criticisms or stories sometime that
[2:43:26] are told on you when you're hanging in
[2:43:28] that vessel of misunderstanding.
[2:43:30] Sometimes they're inaccurate, sometimes
[2:43:32] they're false, but you have to go
[2:43:34] through it because of the pressure that
[2:43:36] it builds up in your life.
[2:43:38] &gt;&gt; You suffer for lies
[2:43:40] or worse for truths that people don't
[2:43:43] want to acknowledge.
[2:43:50] Likewise, in this season, people may may
[2:43:53] tend to see you through the tented lens
[2:43:56] of bias,
[2:43:58] rumor, or misunderstanding. Bias, how
[2:44:01] many of you really know what a bias is?
[2:44:03] Let me help you. Bias is defined as a
[2:44:06] prejudice.
[2:44:09] And there are usually two kinds of
[2:44:11] biases that are mentioned in in our
[2:44:14] society. One is an explicit or a
[2:44:17] conscious bias and one is an implicit or
[2:44:20] an unconscious bias because most of the
[2:44:23] time when someone jumps up and says I
[2:44:25] have no bias,
[2:44:28] they're biased,
[2:44:31] they're prejudiced. The first person to
[2:44:34] say, I I'm not racial prejudice is
[2:44:37] racial prejudice because if you weren't,
[2:44:40] you wouldn't have to say it because your
[2:44:41] life would have already proven it.
[2:44:46] So be quiet.
[2:44:49] You're spilling your secret.
[2:44:52] &gt;&gt; But it is possible to to have a
[2:44:54] conscious bias, a prejudice
[2:44:59] that you're conscious of. Perhaps it's
[2:45:01] also possible to have one that you're
[2:45:03] unconscious of and implicit, but it's a
[2:45:06] prejudice in favor or against one thing,
[2:45:10] a person, a group, a race compared with
[2:45:15] another, usually in a way considered to
[2:45:17] be unfair. There is an awful bias around
[2:45:20] this message toward people who are still
[2:45:24] in denominational systems.
[2:45:28] It's a bias.
[2:45:31] I saw it unraveling this week again.
[2:45:33] Another another thread.
[2:45:37] Facebook prophets.
[2:45:41] Someone said
[2:45:43] what what the scripture said, what
[2:45:44] brother Brandham said about not being
[2:45:47] unequally yolked together with
[2:45:48] unbelievers. and someone ask a fair
[2:45:51] question.
[2:45:53] Not argue and not trying to argue with
[2:45:55] the scripture or the quote, but ask a
[2:45:57] fair question. Well, what is a what is a
[2:45:59] an unbeliever?
[2:46:02] Are we talking about those who believe
[2:46:03] the message? Because I've noticed that
[2:46:06] over the past 15 years, that's the bias.
[2:46:10] You're not even called a believer. In
[2:46:12] fact, they've now used the word believer
[2:46:15] for those who attend a message church.
[2:46:18] Well, I want you to know that's not what
[2:46:20] Jesus had in mind.
[2:46:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:24] &gt;&gt; When he said, "Whosoever believeth."
[2:46:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:32] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[2:46:34] no. That's not what he said. But that's
[2:46:37] how it's come to be interpreted. And so,
[2:46:39] someone just ask a simple question. Are
[2:46:41] we talking about a believer because he
[2:46:43] believes the message of the hour and
[2:46:45] recognizes Brother Brham as a prophet?
[2:46:47] Are we talking about a believer because
[2:46:48] he sees his need for salvation? He
[2:46:51] believes. He accepts the gift. He
[2:46:54] believes that Jesus is the way out and
[2:46:56] he confesses with his mouth because
[2:46:58] remember brother Brandham says it's the
[2:47:00] ABCs. Accept, believe, confess.
[2:47:04] &gt;&gt; And that makes you a what?
[2:47:06] &gt;&gt; A believer. All right.
[2:47:08] &gt;&gt; Now, does that mean that I think that
[2:47:11] that one who believes this message
[2:47:13] should take a companion from the Baptist
[2:47:16] church or the Methodist church? No, I
[2:47:18] don't think that's a good idea.
[2:47:21] But that wasn't the question.
[2:47:23] &gt;&gt; This brother said, "Would you help
[2:47:25] define what a believer is?"
[2:47:29] &gt;&gt; You see, you don't have to understand
[2:47:31] everything there is to know about the
[2:47:32] seven seals to be a believer.
[2:47:36] Amen.
[2:47:37] &gt;&gt; But if you are a believer, you ought to
[2:47:39] want to know more.
[2:47:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:43] &gt;&gt; I've had people argue with me that there
[2:47:45] will won't be anybody in heaven that
[2:47:47] doesn't know the ministry and recognize
[2:47:49] the ministry in the name of William
[2:47:51] Brandham. And I said, "Well, I tell you
[2:47:52] what, that's a heaven I'm not really
[2:47:54] interested in. I've actually lived in
[2:47:56] that one already.
[2:48:00] The one I'm interested in is with a God
[2:48:02] who has a way of escape, a way of
[2:48:04] salvation. They may have come through a
[2:48:07] lot of stuff. Many will give their
[2:48:09] lives.
[2:48:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Not because they're
[2:48:13] unbelievers, but because they're
[2:48:16] believers. But in God's predestinated
[2:48:18] plan, there are uh there are those who
[2:48:21] are uh you know in the church
[2:48:24] &gt;&gt; universal. And there are those who are
[2:48:27] uh called to overcome.
[2:48:30] &gt;&gt; And that's why John the Revel to the
[2:48:32] church, right? To the to the overcomer,
[2:48:35] right?
[2:48:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right.
[2:48:38] &gt;&gt; Nathan stood in the back hall there one
[2:48:40] day and and gave us this uh you know
[2:48:44] helped us to understand that that all
[2:48:47] all uh message uh people those who
[2:48:49] accept the the the message of the hour
[2:48:52] they're they're all believers. But it's
[2:48:54] a difference between believer and bride.
[2:48:57] &gt;&gt; All bride has to be a believer.
[2:49:02] &gt;&gt; But all and all bride started as a
[2:49:04] believer.
[2:49:06] But that doesn't make
[2:49:09] and you do the church, the bride, the
[2:49:11] believer, the overcomer. You do it the
[2:49:13] same way.
[2:49:14] &gt;&gt; Come on. Let's not be so so ridiculous
[2:49:17] here. Whosoever calleth upon the name of
[2:49:19] the Lord. If you believe in your heart
[2:49:21] and confess with your mouth and then you
[2:49:24] go on to obey and live the closest life
[2:49:26] you can live, here's what the prophet
[2:49:28] told you. He said, "According to the
[2:49:31] light
[2:49:33] &gt;&gt; that God has shined in your life, what
[2:49:36] God has let you see?"
[2:49:40] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you see?
[2:49:42] &gt;&gt; I am.
[2:49:42] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you're an eagle
[2:49:44] &gt;&gt; and not an eagle maniac?
[2:49:47] &gt;&gt; How many of you'd rather be an eagle
[2:49:49] than an eagle maniac?
[2:49:50] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[2:49:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, that got more quiet than anything
[2:49:55] I've said.
[2:49:59] God hides you in that shadow, in that
[2:50:01] dark place when you're in the vessel of
[2:50:03] misunderstanding, not to forget you,
[2:50:06] but he wants to finish fermenting you
[2:50:10] for future usefulness.
[2:50:12] In that place, your words are twisted,
[2:50:15] your motives are questioned, your
[2:50:17] identity is dismissed.
[2:50:20] Obedience to God leads to suspicion from
[2:50:23] men. Many times you suffer for false
[2:50:27] stories or truths that others reject.
[2:50:30] Like David before Goliath or Paul on
[2:50:33] trial, your calling, your faith is
[2:50:36] questioned but not recognized.
[2:50:40] You are seen through the opinions and
[2:50:42] biases of others. Instead, the wine is
[2:50:44] judged by the perception of the filter,
[2:50:48] through the colored glass.
[2:50:50] And and no one went through this
[2:50:52] anymore. And I'm closing. Musicians are
[2:50:54] coming. No one went through this anymore
[2:50:56] than David.
[2:51:04] Melik Davidid, King David.
[2:51:09] Bless his heart.
[2:51:13] You dare want to throw up every time his
[2:51:18] name is mentioned,
[2:51:20] all you want to mention is Bath Sheba.
[2:51:23] Are you kidding me?
[2:51:27] &gt;&gt; Mention his prayer of repentance and
[2:51:30] confession.
[2:51:32] &gt;&gt; Mention the fact that
[2:51:36] he had to be anointed three different
[2:51:38] times
[2:51:40] &gt;&gt; before he got to be who God called him
[2:51:41] to be.
[2:51:44] &gt;&gt; First by Samuel, then by Judah, then by
[2:51:46] all of Israel. And I may have the two in
[2:51:48] the middle out of order.
[2:51:51] Before he could be the king over the
[2:51:52] United Kingdom of Israel, he was
[2:51:54] anointed three times. And look what he
[2:51:57] went through. The bear didn't get him.
[2:51:58] The lion didn't get him. Goliath didn't
[2:52:00] get him. Saul didn't get him.
[2:52:03] &gt;&gt; He survived all the beasts.
[2:52:06] &gt;&gt; You will too.
[2:52:08] &gt;&gt; You will too. I will too.
[2:52:11] &gt;&gt; Four-legged and two-legged. We will. We
[2:52:13] will. We will. Because greater is he
[2:52:15] that is in us.
[2:52:17] &gt;&gt; Don't you get you a little martyed?
[2:52:19] Don't you get your little martyr complex
[2:52:20] and go out here today, nobody
[2:52:22] understands you.
[2:52:24] &gt;&gt; Nobody understands me. Because the
[2:52:26] reality is some of you would be much
[2:52:28] easier understood if you would try to
[2:52:30] be.
[2:52:34] &gt;&gt; You don't even try to be understood. You
[2:52:36] try to be as odd as as you could
[2:52:38] possibly be. You you you find your
[2:52:41] identity. Whoa. Amen.
[2:52:43] &gt;&gt; In your oddness.
[2:52:50] So don't you go out here and know about
[2:52:53] me.
[2:52:57] Have you ever thought about maybe just
[2:52:59] settling into the family and not always
[2:53:03] having to be the center of attention?
[2:53:08] Have you ever just thought about being a
[2:53:10] part of the family? Uh, God bless you.
[2:53:16] Shaking hands, normal, hugging, normal,
[2:53:18] treating people normal, just be a part
[2:53:21] of the family instead of it always
[2:53:23] having to be about you're different.
[2:53:25] You're different. You're different. So
[2:53:26] different. Oh, it's going to be quiet. I
[2:53:28] don't care. I don't care. I paid a price
[2:53:30] to get here today. I don't care. I'm
[2:53:32] going to obey. I'm going to say
[2:53:33] everything. I don't want to feed I want
[2:53:35] to make sure before I close that I don't
[2:53:37] feed that kind of spirit on somebody to
[2:53:40] where they think that that I'm just so
[2:53:42] misunderstood. I'm so perfect but
[2:53:44] everybody misunderstands me. No, don't
[2:53:45] you get that on you.
[2:53:47] &gt;&gt; If you're there, you've got two reasons
[2:53:49] for being there or two two excuses we
[2:53:52] could say for being there. It could be
[2:53:53] that God has put you there. It could be
[2:53:56] that you refuse to leave
[2:53:58] [Music]
[2:54:00] &gt;&gt; when he got ready to pour you out.
[2:54:04] You found your value
[2:54:07] in swimming the other way.
[2:54:12] &gt;&gt; You were reading one day,
[2:54:15] I will have a peculiar people. And you
[2:54:19] said, I must be that one.
[2:54:25] I must make sure that everybody knows
[2:54:28] that the standard doesn't apply to me.
[2:54:35] I'm my own person. I want everybody to
[2:54:38] know.
[2:54:46] I want everybody to know. I I want
[2:54:48] everybody to know. There are people who
[2:54:49] just want everybody to know. I can't I
[2:54:52] can't eat nuts. Don't eat them.
[2:54:55] You know, there's just people that just
[2:54:57] it's the first thing you learn about
[2:54:58] people is all of this uh
[2:55:03] they they they stay too long in the
[2:55:05] vessel of misunderstanding. You shook
[2:55:08] yourself up. You got so shook up.
[2:55:14] We do this when we're immature.
[2:55:18] When I first had a son, I got jealous.
[2:55:26] after the first week because everybody
[2:55:29] else wanted to hold him.
[2:55:33] That's how immature I was.
[2:55:36] I just loved him so much. I didn't mind
[2:55:38] his mama holding him. She desperately
[2:55:40] needed to hold him at times.
[2:55:44] But I I got a little jealous. I was
[2:55:46] immature. And I'm willing to have you
[2:55:48] look at me like I'm weird because I know
[2:55:51] I'm not the only one that's ever
[2:55:53] experienced that feeling.
[2:55:56] And then you start maturing a little bit
[2:55:57] and you think, "Oh, Lord, would somebody
[2:55:59] please take him?"
[2:56:01] Oh, I don't think I can take no more.
[2:56:03] Please.
[2:56:06] You walk the floor and walk the floor
[2:56:08] and walk the floor. Is that right, mama?
[2:56:10] And he poops and screams and poops and
[2:56:12] screams and poops and screams.
[2:56:15] Oh, God help us. I wish somebody would
[2:56:19] come and hold him.
[2:56:22] One night, my wife was ex totally
[2:56:25] exhausted. We weren't like some of you
[2:56:27] who have, you know, just readily
[2:56:29] available people who will lay down their
[2:56:31] life and help you raise your children.
[2:56:38] We didn't have that. My mother was
[2:56:40] working.
[2:56:42] My father didn't know me.
[2:56:44] My wife's parents lived in a foreign
[2:56:46] country
[2:56:49] and there were many many times we we had
[2:56:52] nobody. Guess what you do when you have
[2:56:54] nobody? You do it.
[2:56:58] &gt;&gt; You pull up your bootstraps and you look
[2:57:00] each other in the eye and you say, "We
[2:57:02] can do this."
[2:57:04] &gt;&gt; And you do it. If you don't have to, God
[2:57:07] bless you. I'm glad you don't. But I
[2:57:09] remember looking at my wife one night
[2:57:11] and she was absolutely exhausted and so
[2:57:13] was I. And even though my mother had to
[2:57:16] work the next morning, I said, "I'm
[2:57:17] going to call them all." And and
[2:57:19] normally she would have said, "No, no,
[2:57:20] no, no, don't do that. We can get
[2:57:22] through the night. We can do it. We can
[2:57:24] get through the night." But this night,
[2:57:25] she said through the tears.
[2:57:32] And then I And then I'm sitting there
[2:57:34] thinking, I was jealous because I didn't
[2:57:36] get to hold him. And now I just want
[2:57:39] somebody
[2:57:41] any stranger in in the pl you know come
[2:57:43] hold my baby because you see how you get
[2:57:46] some of us have not matured.
[2:57:50] &gt;&gt; Some of us have not let the experiences
[2:57:52] of life grow us up.
[2:57:55] &gt;&gt; And this is part of the sacred season
[2:57:57] that we're in right now. May God give us
[2:58:00] strength to bite the bullet in this
[2:58:03] uncomfortable time of being
[2:58:05] misunderstood. And may we not spend one
[2:58:08] extra night in the vessel of
[2:58:10] misunderstanding because we have found
[2:58:12] our identity or our comfort in being
[2:58:16] misunderstandable.
[2:58:18] &gt;&gt; But may we be ready to be poured out
[2:58:21] into something else because it may be
[2:58:23] worse. The next vessel might be harder.
[2:58:28] &gt;&gt; So we want to have all the strength we
[2:58:30] can muster. But at the end of this, I
[2:58:32] can do it because greater.
[2:58:35] &gt;&gt; I can make it. I'm an overcomer.
[2:58:37] Hallelujah. I'm not just a believer. I'm
[2:58:40] a believer.
[2:58:42] &gt;&gt; I don't just have faith. I have access
[2:58:44] to super faith.
[2:58:48] &gt;&gt; I don't just I didn't just meet Jesus. I
[2:58:51] have a revelation of who Jesus is.
[2:58:55] &gt;&gt; And he's on board. I don't have to go to
[2:58:58] the to the confession booth to find him
[2:59:01] &gt;&gt; or count the beads to get forgiveness
[2:59:04] &gt;&gt; or say the Apostles Creed or Hail Mary.
[2:59:07] He lives in me
[2:59:10] &gt;&gt; and he's as close as the mention of his
[2:59:12] name.
[2:59:14] &gt;&gt; He's great and greatly to be praised.
[2:59:16] He's worthy. If you're leaving here
[2:59:18] thinking that I don't love you, think
[2:59:20] again.
[2:59:23] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you the truth because I do.
[2:59:29] You'll be more you'll be more uh likely
[2:59:32] to build relationships
[2:59:35] if you can learn how to walk into a
[2:59:36] room.
[2:59:42] You will
[2:59:45] because of some of our stuff.
[2:59:50] It it goes with us. we carry it
[2:59:53] and it it frightens people. It puts
[2:59:57] people at odds.
[3:00:01] They don't know how to embrace you
[3:00:05] because
[3:00:06] you you're bigger than life.
[3:00:11] You don't know how to just be our
[3:00:14] cousin,
[3:00:16] our family member, our brother, our
[3:00:18] sister. Don't let the enemy tell you
[3:00:21] that people are rejecting you and you
[3:00:24] have nothing to do with it because
[3:00:27] sometimes we do.
[3:00:30] &gt;&gt; Being a nervous person, I know that I
[3:00:33] project that
[3:00:35] and it makes other people nervous
[3:00:39] and you don't want to be that. You You
[3:00:41] want to try.
[3:00:43] Anybody following me?
[3:00:48] You don't have to always be grouchy.
[3:00:55] Love somebody.
[3:00:58] Don't just pick out weaker ones to be
[3:01:01] your support system.
[3:01:04] &gt;&gt; Build a relationship with a with a
[3:01:06] prayer warrior.
[3:01:08] &gt;&gt; Build your relationship with somebody
[3:01:10] that's as on fire for God Monday at noon
[3:01:13] &gt;&gt; as they are Sunday at noon.
[3:01:16] Don't find all of your validation out
[3:01:18] there in the world among sinners either.
[3:01:21] &gt;&gt; Find somebody in the household of faith
[3:01:23] and crucify and deny all of yourself
[3:01:29] until you can begin to build a
[3:01:31] relationship with somebody that knows
[3:01:32] you. See, the family knows you and they
[3:01:36] love you anyway.
[3:01:40] Let me see if that's that was I think
[3:01:41] maybe that's all.
[3:01:49] Do I need to call you up?
[3:02:01] [Music]
[3:02:03] rather have Jesus
[3:02:07] &gt;&gt; than silver
[3:02:10] or gold.
[3:02:13] I'd rather
[3:02:15] be his
[3:02:18] than have riches
[3:02:22] untold.
[3:02:24] I'd rather
[3:02:27] have Jesus
[3:02:30] &gt;&gt; than houses
[3:02:34] or
[3:02:36] &gt;&gt; I'd rather
[3:02:39] be led

[3:07:26] his presence

[3:07:31] [Music]
[3:07:33] Oh, I

[3:07:47] all.
[3:07:50] Oh,

[3:07:57] Savior.
[3:07:59] I
[3:08:01] surrender
[3:08:04] all
[3:08:07] and all
[3:08:09] to Jesus.
[3:08:12] I
[3:08:14] surrender
[3:08:16] humbly
[3:08:18] at his feet. My thou
[3:08:24] worldly
[3:08:26] pleasures
[3:08:28] all
[3:08:30] forsake and take
[3:08:33] me Jesus
[3:08:36] take me now.
[3:08:39] Oh I
[3:08:41] surrender
[3:08:44] all.
[3:08:46] Oh, I
[3:08:49] surrender
[3:08:51] all.
[3:08:54] Oh,
[3:08:56] to thee my blessed
[3:09:01] savior.
[3:09:03] I
[3:09:04] surrender
[3:09:06] all.
[3:09:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, I
[3:09:12] surrender
[3:09:14] all.
[3:09:18] I
[3:09:19] surrender
[3:09:21] all
[3:09:24] to Jesus
[3:09:26] to thee my bless.
[3:09:38] You know, there's a saying in in the
[3:09:42] world,
[3:09:44] be the change that you're looking for.
[3:09:49] Or maybe it didn't come from Proverbs,
[3:09:53] but the concept did.
[3:09:55] &gt;&gt; The scripture concept is if you are
[3:09:59] desperate for there to be a change,
[3:10:01] become the change. God called you and I
[3:10:05] to be agents and ambassadors of change.
[3:10:11] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't want you to misunderstand
[3:10:13] yourself. I would want you to know
[3:10:16] that God made you
[3:10:19] unique in every way.
[3:10:22] But that doesn't mean he wants to leave
[3:10:24] us with everything we came here with.
[3:10:27] &gt;&gt; There are times that he wants us to
[3:10:30] become agents of change.
[3:10:33] And I think I know the reason why. And I
[3:10:35] hate to hang it on you here at the end,
[3:10:38] but I think that we're really going to
[3:10:41] need each other in those last few days.
[3:10:47] I think we're really going to need each
[3:10:50] other. And some people are focused on
[3:10:53] making sure that there will be canned
[3:10:56] food to eat and grain stored up. And
[3:10:59] they're looking at it in a very
[3:11:01] practical way. God bless them. That's
[3:11:04] what they're called to do perhaps.
[3:11:07] But I don't think it's going to matter
[3:11:08] so much.
[3:11:10] What I believe is that we're going to
[3:11:13] need each other in every way
[3:11:16] &gt;&gt; to stand. I don't think it's going to be
[3:11:18] a long period of time. I think it's
[3:11:21] going to be just the last last little
[3:11:24] season before we go out of here. We're
[3:11:27] going to need each other. We're going to
[3:11:28] need to be able to trust each other.
[3:11:31] We're going to need to be able to get
[3:11:32] along with each other because in that
[3:11:35] quick short work, we're going to be
[3:11:38] spent for the gospel, for the kingdom
[3:11:41] message. Everything we carry is going to
[3:11:44] be poured out. And I don't know how. I
[3:11:48] don't know where. I don't know exactly
[3:11:49] what it will look like. But if we raise
[3:11:52] up to do what he said we would, that
[3:11:56] last climax of God's authority operating
[3:12:00] in sons,
[3:12:02] I think we're going to have to get
[3:12:03] ready. I think we're going to have to
[3:12:05] make preparation for those days. If you
[3:12:09] can't stand to be in the room with me
[3:12:11] now,
[3:12:13] &gt;&gt; see, we're going to have to get over
[3:12:15] some of our biases.
[3:12:18] &gt;&gt; We're going to have to learn to be to
[3:12:20] depend on one another. The one thing you
[3:12:22] don't want to is to be in the foxhole
[3:12:24] &gt;&gt; with somebody that has ambition
[3:12:27] &gt;&gt; or who loves their life more than yours.
[3:12:30] &gt;&gt; You actually want to try to be in there
[3:12:32] with somebody who is willing to risk
[3:12:35] their life for you, knowing that you're
[3:12:37] willing to risk your life for them. And
[3:12:40] that makes a safer foxhole.
[3:12:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:12:43] &gt;&gt; Because no matter who the target is,
[3:12:45] somebody's there to help cover and
[3:12:47] protect. Whether you realize it or not,
[3:12:50] I believe that's the hovering work of
[3:12:52] the Holy Spirit this morning. I believe
[3:12:54] he wants to protect us. I believe he
[3:12:56] wants to preserve us.
[3:12:59] &gt;&gt; And change is something you can chase
[3:13:04] or you can make up your mind to be the
[3:13:06] change.
[3:13:07] &gt;&gt; And the other thing the Lord spoke to me
[3:13:09] while we were singing is he reminded me
[3:13:11] the importance of harmony.
[3:13:15] Did you know there are people who can't
[3:13:17] sing the melody?
[3:13:19] They can't hear the melody.
[3:13:21] We have several in here who can't sing
[3:13:24] the melody because they don't they can't
[3:13:26] hear it. And they're almost always
[3:13:29] singing harmony
[3:13:31] and not always in the right key.
[3:13:35] But sometimes if you were just a little
[3:13:39] softer,
[3:13:43] your harmony,
[3:13:45] your voice would complement
[3:13:48] the one next to you and there would be
[3:13:51] that's what harmony is. It's layering
[3:13:54] pitches.
[3:13:57] Everyone doesn't sing tenor. Aren't you
[3:14:00] glad?
[3:14:02] Because sometimes I would go back and
[3:14:05] and hear where I sung a high tenor lead
[3:14:08] and it and it it I think how did people
[3:14:10] stand it? It feels like uh fingernails
[3:14:13] on the on the blackboard. What if we all
[3:14:16] were singing like that? What if we all
[3:14:18] to what if we could just uh use the the
[3:14:22] voice that God has given us and be
[3:14:25] mindful of making it blend
[3:14:28] &gt;&gt; with the person next to us. our tone,
[3:14:32] their tone, our voice, their voice. You
[3:14:34] layer those voices together and the
[3:14:36] sound gets so full. Now, I heard a
[3:14:38] little clip of a of a practice of the of
[3:14:42] the younger people here this week and uh
[3:14:45] I saw the video and it was before the
[3:14:48] the girls decided to sing.
[3:14:51] All they were doing was just moving
[3:14:53] their tiny little mouth
[3:14:56] and they reminded me of the little
[3:14:57] hamster that comes to get the little
[3:14:59] water bottle.
[3:15:03] But I was told that after that it got
[3:15:05] amazing
[3:15:08] because you you you your sound your
[3:15:11] sound is necessary.
[3:15:15] &gt;&gt; You you got to let it out.
[3:15:18] &gt;&gt; If you're doing it for the King of
[3:15:20] Kings, you you want to be heard,
[3:15:23] but you don't want to be the star.
[3:15:27] &gt;&gt; You wanna you want to make the star. You
[3:15:29] want to make the body the star
[3:15:32] &gt;&gt; and so you adjust your volume or your
[3:15:35] sound to try to complement the one next
[3:15:38] to you and that's harmony. And there's
[3:15:40] nothing more beautiful than when a
[3:15:42] family sings together and one's pitch is
[3:15:44] a little higher than the other and
[3:15:45] they're sliding around perhaps to find
[3:15:48] their place. But when they find it, it's
[3:15:51] music to the ear. It's music to the
[3:15:53] heart. It's music to the soul. And in
[3:15:56] this body, we have so many gifts and so
[3:15:58] much talent that that's not just music.
[3:16:02] But we've got to learn to figure out how
[3:16:04] to make our tone blend in harmony with
[3:16:08] someone else.
[3:16:10] Oh, that's flat. Can you say amen?
[3:16:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:16:15] &gt;&gt; Maybe I should just call names and tell
[3:16:17] tell you some of you need to tune your
[3:16:19] tone.
[3:16:22] It's
[3:16:22] &gt;&gt; not the volume you need to worry about.
[3:16:24] It's the tone so that it and that
[3:16:27] carries over. It's not just music. It
[3:16:30] carries over into everything.
[3:16:34] &gt;&gt; You know, if if you if you're putting a
[3:16:36] meal together and two women argue over
[3:16:39] who makes the entree
[3:16:43] and you only need one
[3:16:46] and you ask for chicken and they want to
[3:16:48] bring steak,
[3:16:50] just blend.
[3:16:53] Don't make everything so complicated in
[3:16:57] life. Give up
[3:16:59] &gt;&gt; and make up your mind. I want to I want
[3:17:01] to blend with someone. I don't want to
[3:17:04] be that somebody.
[3:17:07] &gt;&gt; I want to blend. I want to make a
[3:17:09] family. I want to make God a a a
[3:17:14] living organism in this house.
[3:17:17] &gt;&gt; I want to give it to him. I want to be
[3:17:20] used for his glory. How many of you want
[3:17:22] to be usable?
[3:17:24] &gt;&gt; Then be blendable.
[3:17:27] &gt;&gt; Be the change that you desire to see.
[3:17:29] Father, here we are.
[3:17:32] This room is full of sincere hearts
[3:17:38] &gt;&gt; and potential overcomers.
[3:17:42] And we need each other in this thing.
[3:17:45] We we we we may not see it yet, but we
[3:17:48] will.
[3:17:50] And today we ask that you would anoint
[3:17:52] our eyes to see how we can be a an
[3:17:56] organism living, moving, breathing in
[3:18:00] the life of Jesus Christ. And in order
[3:18:03] to get there, we we have to be uh
[3:18:06] misunderstood,
[3:18:09] kind of gazed on at times as we learn
[3:18:12] our way and as we allow
[3:18:15] the least to settle in the wine.
[3:18:18] And every time we get all shook up, we
[3:18:21] cloudy the work that you're trying to
[3:18:24] accomplish in us. May we remain rock
[3:18:29] solid and ever steady in the service of
[3:18:32] the Lord. May we be dependable in every
[3:18:35] way. May we offer you everything
[3:18:39] that you would have us to leave behind.
[3:18:42] May we give it to you right now. And may
[3:18:44] we find grace to surrender. We ask for
[3:18:47] your help. It's the only help that's
[3:18:49] going to help is your help. We ask in
[3:18:52] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[3:18:55] for his glory. Would you raise both
[3:18:57] hands if you're able and sing one more
[3:18:59] time? I surrender. I
[3:19:03] &gt;&gt; surrender
[3:19:05] all.
[3:19:07] [Music]
[3:19:09] &gt;&gt; I
[3:19:10] surrender
[3:19:13] all.
[3:19:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:19:17] All to thee, my blessed
[3:19:22] Savior,
[3:19:24] I
[3:19:26] surrender.
[3:19:28] &gt;&gt; You're not surrendering for anybody but
[3:19:30] yourself. Oh,
[3:19:32] &gt;&gt; I
[3:19:33] surrender
[3:19:35] all.
[3:19:36] &gt;&gt; I surrender all.
[3:19:39] I
[3:19:41] surrender.
[3:19:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, that sounds good.
[3:19:44] Surrender all
[3:19:48] to thee my blessed
[3:19:54] I
[3:19:56] &gt;&gt; one more time tell him I surrender all
[3:19:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus I will
[3:20:03] surrender
[3:20:05] all
[3:20:06] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[3:20:08] oh I
[3:20:10] surrender
[3:20:14] Glory be to God.
[3:20:18] To thee my blessed
[3:20:22] savior.
[3:20:26] [Music]
[3:20:28] &gt;&gt; As these young people continued to sing
[3:20:31] together, they begin to sound.
[3:20:36] I I I don't want to say it wrong. You
[3:20:40] would have thought there was 50 or more
[3:20:43] of them. The fullness that was beginning
[3:20:46] to come out of their mouths as they sung
[3:20:49] for the glory of God.
[3:20:52] And they entered in to what they were
[3:20:54] singing. And the way they were putting
[3:20:56] it out there, if you hadn't have known
[3:20:58] how many there would have been, you'd
[3:20:59] have thought it was a a full house
[3:21:01] choir. That's what happens when
[3:21:04] everybody has the same mind.
[3:21:07] May we find that as our example.
[3:21:10] May May we hear the same out of our
[3:21:12] little children's choir. May we hear the
[3:21:15] same when we are worshiping in here. Not
[3:21:18] just that the music is it, but in
[3:21:20] everything we do. May we find our place
[3:21:23] to support one another in this thing.
[3:21:26] Lay your hand on the one next to you
[3:21:27] now. Father, strength to my brother,
[3:21:31] strength to my sister. It won't be easy
[3:21:33] getting them all the way through
[3:21:35] any of the vessels, but they're coming
[3:21:37] through. They're coming through. They're
[3:21:40] not going to face it alone. They're
[3:21:42] coming through. They're going to find
[3:21:44] their place in the chalice of the king.
[3:21:48] They're going to find their place as
[3:21:50] wine in your cup. We're going to find
[3:21:54] our place in the kingdom of our God.
[3:21:58] Bless the Lord. Bless the Lord.
[3:22:02] Bless the Lord. Bless his name. Father,
[3:22:07] for every person who uh struggles in
[3:22:10] this hour, may you surround them with
[3:22:13] your wonderful love. May you remind them
[3:22:18] you are not in this alone.
[3:22:21] &gt;&gt; Father, whether we feel you, whether we
[3:22:23] see you, whether we know what you're
[3:22:25] doing or not, we trust the promise of
[3:22:28] your word. You are working a work of
[3:22:30] glory in the deepest part of who we are.
[3:22:34] Go
[3:22:35] be free, Holy Spirit.
[3:22:38] Do what needs to be done in us.
[3:22:42] Build us together, stronger for your
[3:22:46] kingdom. And may our love for one
[3:22:48] another be more than just a greeting.
[3:22:51] May it be deep.
[3:22:53] May it be love that covers.
[3:22:56] May it be love that empowers.
[3:22:59] May it be love that prepares us for
[3:23:02] rapture.
[3:23:03] &gt;&gt; This is what we desire
[3:23:05] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. You're dismissed to go.
