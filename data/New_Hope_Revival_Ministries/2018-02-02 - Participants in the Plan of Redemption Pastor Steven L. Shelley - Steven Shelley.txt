TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you know there are times that it can be incredibly difficult to get our mind around the magnitude of God's love the father's love for us the scriptures are clear for instance first John chapter 3 verse 1 in the amplified version says see what an incredible quality of love the father has given shown bestowed on us that we should be permitted to be named and called and counted the children of God and so we are the reason that the world does not know recognize and acknowledge us is that it does not know recognize or acknowledge him in verse 2 it says beloved we are even here and now God's children sons of God it is not yet disclosed or made clear what we shall be Hereafter but we know that when he comes and is manifested we shall as God's children resemble and be like him for we shall see him just as he really is you know the Bible talks about sonship it's a very important part of what God is doing in his Bridal body in this hour there's a spirit of adoption that's working in the sons of God to bring us to a place of maturity that we can truly participate with Christ in his plan of redemption for planet Earth the bride is moving into a place where she knows the Father's heart she knows the will of God and she moves in divine synchronization with his plan with his will I remember as a boy agonizing for days weeks sometimes months to try to discover God's will in a particular situation I believe that's what we must do until there's something else to do but I truly believe that we're coming into an hour where as we continue to bring our thoughts under subjection to the Word of God that we will begin to know and to discern the will of our Heavenly Father I'm not saying that there won't be a need for prayer and intercession there absolutely will always be a need for prayer for intercession or fasting setting ourselves apart to know God but I truly believe there's a union and a oneness that's coming and not just for a spiritually elite pastor prophet leader teacher but for you as an individual the Bible says but as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God all sons do not come to maturity at the same time at the same point you see the body of Christ is a many membered body it's a living moving breathing organism and I am a part of that body and I trust that you now know by the revelation of the spirit that you also are a part of that body the Bible tells us here in 1st Corinthians chapter 12 12 for even as the body is one and yet has many members and all the members of the body though they are many are one body so also is Christ there's a union that takes place as we receive deeper realms of Revelation from the Word of God it's not by our experience alone that we grow it's by revelation from the Word of God I believe that most of us have heard enough preaching to move us way beyond the levels of perfection and into the stature of a perfect man but that word of God that's been planted in us it has to be quickened and made alive by a spirit of understanding by spirit of Revelation and I believe the bride is calling out for that in this hour don't you dare disqualify yourself because I believe that it that calling and wooing and drawing that you experienced in the in the womb of your spirit we say on the inside of the inside that deep calling to the deep sometimes we even refer to it as a divine dissatisfaction or a divine frustration it's not with the Lord that we become frustrated it's with ourselves it's with our ability to yield but I want you to know this is this is a victory that's one minute by minute it's not a victory perhaps one once and for all but it's daily finding a place in him daily allowing his word to be formed the very nature and life of Jesus Christ to be formed on the inside of who we are the Bible tells us in Hebrews chapter 2 and verse 10 for it was an act worthy of God and fitting to the divine nature that he for whose sake and by whom all things have their existence in bringing many sons into glory should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect should bring to maturity the human experience necessary to be perfected equipped for his office as high priest through suffering there's a lot of words in those two verses of Scripture but the truth that we need to pull from that is Jesus was the firstfruits of many sons of many brethren there's a move of the Spirit of God going on in this hour to bring us into that place you see it's vitally important in this hour that we begin to see ourselves as participants in what the Lord is about to do on planet Earth Hebrews 3:14 says for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast in the Lord the amplified says for we have become fellows with Christ that word is sometimes translated companions participants or partners can you imagine that you have been chosen to be a partner a participant with Christ in his plan of redemption in the end time that's where we are right now we have become fellows with Christ the Messiah and share in all he has for us if only we hold our first newborn confidence and original assured expectation in virtue of which we are believers firm and unshaken to the end that's the key we cannot be easily shaken by the circumstances of our life it's possible that many of us are not really seeing our individual part in what God desires to do in this hour perhaps we sit in a service and we hear the word of God we recognize that it is rich and that it is timely and maybe we look around the congregation and we see all of those that we feel like it applies to these are the ones that God is bringing to maturity while I just sit here on the Pew but I want you to know that that is most likely not the case at all it's very very important for you to understand that you cannot always recognize the inner working of God in your life until it begins to manifest one of the ways that I notice when God is working on my life or when the word is working in my life is when I noticed that my reactions begin to change same circumstances familiar situations but on the inside of me there is a different reaction perhaps my words are different my emotions are different in fact I began to to move as the word says that a believer that a son of God should move and when I see that even in the smallest thing I celebrate it I may do it alone I may do it in the privacy of my own office but I just say Lord I want to thank you that you are giving me victory the circumstances of our lives there lessons learned every Hill every tunnel every Valley all of it a part of God positioning us for this hour so that we can be totally dependent on him the more dependent we become on the Lord the more of his life is manifested through us the more of his character the more of his attributes I also remember the scripture says don't despise the day of small beginnings are of small things it's amazing to me at times how God is working mighty works in us and through us and we fail to recognize it because the enemy is lying because of his accusations I just encourage you right now as you continue to fully surrender your life to the Father's will for you as you begin to pray for that union with him to manifest that you become one with him when he moves your moving when he speaks your speaking when when he ministers your ministering as that begins to form in the bridal body in this hour causing us to be able to overcome by the anointing there is an overcomers anointing that's moving on the body of Christ in this hour if we can only recognize it an anointing that brings us over all of our circumstances all of those familiar places that the enemy has trapped us in for so long I want you to know that God is doing great and mighty things in the lives of his people in 2018 and I'm expecting that what God is doing on the inside of his people is soon going to manifest in our fellowships in our assemblies in our prayer groups in ways that we have been praying for and expecting for a long time don't you be discouraged with the circumstances that are surrounding you right now put your hope your trust your confidence in the Lord Jesus Christ and he will surely see you through let's allow him to live his life through us day by day minute by minute for the glory of God god bless you on your journey [Music] you [Music]
