[Laughter] [Music] we can't make any apologies we have no apologies to make what they call heresy is the way that i worship my god i just can't help it i was just sensing in the spirit and i know that some of you have been in a battle this week i know that your emotions have been raw and i know that you've been hurting and some grieving and some feeling the loss i know that some have been caught up in a swirl that can really have an effect on you when you come to the house of the lord and i've been watching god minister to different ones and i'm so thrilled and i'd like for us to sing that again and i'm going to pray before we do and i'm going to ask the lord to separate every one of us from all unbelief just to come right in and cut us off from all unbelief let it fall off of us you know that's what the enemy likes to do he likes to to fill us with unbelief to attack us with unbelief to wrap up our minds with unbelief when we come into the presence of the lord then the enemy likes to disqualify us and tell us well you've thought that and you've had this going on and you've been critical and he doesn't want you to get to the presence of god and i believe that we can speak with authority today and cut off all unbelief we're calling for the waters of separation to come this morning and cut us off from all unbelief from all evil we're asking that the waters of separation would come and separate us from all witchcraft break off every curse that's been spoken against your life or against this house or against this ministry because it's the ministry of jesus christ so we're going to believe right now that he will meet you where you are that he will touch you father we thank you for your grace we thank you that the blood paid the price but had it not been for grace the blood couldn't have got to my house it was your grace that was the transportation it was your grace that was the delivery system to deliver the blood of the lamb to my door to my house to my family i want to thank you for the blood but i want to thank you for the grace of god we are not saved by works lest any man should boast we recognize that it is the gift of god so now in the authority of jesus christ we declare right now that we shall be separated from all unbelief that the waters of purity and separation will come and flow over our lives right now wash away the residue of the last battle wash away the residue of the last season and send us forth into a new hour into a new season into a new place in christ we take new ground in the name of the lord jesus christ footsteps means possession we take new inheritance right now we lay claim on old promises and we ask that the spirit of god would quicken them and make them new in our hearts today be free of unbelief be free of condemnation be free of all critical spirits that have worked against you this week and realize that the blood has come the blood has come to set us free the blood can wash away my sin nothing by the blood nothing by the blood and what can make [Music] you know i can [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] peace [Music] [Music] oh there is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] peace [Music] [Music] is [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] healing [Music] oh [Music] [Music] there is nothing foreign [Music] [Music] away nothing but the blood nothing but the blood the one can make [Music] [Music] nothing but the blood holy worship lord we worship you have your way lord have your way [Music] this song came to my heart this morning i just wanted to sing it in the things

let's thank the lord for these musicians [Music] [Applause] yes he's good thank you all so much god bless you we're just so grateful for what the lord is doing here today i realize that it's 12 30 and uh god is here he has been here he's not getting ready to leave you'll be seated just a moment because i feel for you i know you've been standing for so long you musicians again god bless you thank you for what you have done you've made this a very special day by giving to the lord and let's thank god again for their life and for their obedience to him well our hearts are full because his presence is here and we know that uh some of our friends are already getting out of church because we see them connecting here on the stream we're just getting started this morning but uh we we feel humble that god would visit us the way this way and let us let us open our hearts up to experience he's always here but it's like benjamin said it's our choice whether we come into his presence and experience him or not we have to make that that decision god has been good to us are you rested enough to stand for the reading of the word i want to add my comments to brother greeley he has already welcomed every visitor and he has said how wonderful it is to have the millers and the hodges here for their first sunday service as landed immigrants because they have at least a house and a beautiful place there in opalaka near the tiger town and um they have moved in i don't think they're all unpacked just yet i can't imagine that they would be scoring who you talked to brother daniel was giving me a report this morning he said as long as you don't talk to the girls so he had one one version and and he thought for sure they'd have another but god has been good to those of you brothers who helped them friday evening and those of you who went saturday also to help them i know they have thanked you already but we thank you as a church body it was a busy time because the yantas family had a big get-together yesterday graves family we should say and for granny graves who turned 80 some weeks ago and i heard that they had a wonderful time i wish we could have been there but it just wasn't possible right then but god just made a way when i realized it was the same day as moving day i was a bit concerned but god really moved and levi and luke and the shelley boys yesterday and then austin and stephen the night before and uh they were able to get some heavy stuff put in and god is just good he is good and millie who is here a school friend of anna christine's uh she'll always now be special to us because of our little amelia who is called millie and uh her name just slipped my mind this morning and i said i don't remember her name and they said millie and i thought how can i forget that we're very happy now how many of you like a friend like that take time off dry help you drive all the way down and then buy their ticket to fly home after they've helped you move in i mean you know that that is that's a real friend will you be my friend too i sure hope you will god bless you turn to genesis chapter one let's go back to the book of beginnings let's see where it all started and i'll try my best to uh to preach a couple of hours you thought i was going to say try my best to be brief but uh they tell me that they're celebrating my birthday today it's not yet although some people have apologized for being late we usually have the picnic the sunday after but uh we had we thought the gree leaves are going to be away next sunday it turns out they're not and we wanted to have it when they could be here as well so it's a little early but uh they you know i i we always have these wonderful fellowships like we had last sunday lots of wonderful food and the weather's a lot prettier today than it was last sunday but the fellowship was good i think i left here after nine o'clock last sunday night still fellowshipping wonderful the young people got to singing in the portico and they got to having jericho marches after they'd played their volleyball until they could hardly stand up and then they were still jericho marching and singing and i i am wore out when somebody says at the end of the night what about singing father abraham i mean come on who in their right mind wants to sing that song anyway that's older than three but we all did you know sometimes it's all right to be a little silly especially if you're doing it with god's people and uh we have our serious moments too we're entering into one right now genesis chapter 1 verse 26 and 27 um i'm gonna i'm going to do some more on quickening power from last sunday and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth and so god created man in his own image i want you to say own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them [Music] now in genesis 2 19 if you'll go there before you before we have a word of prayer and you take your seat and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the field every fowl of the air and brought them unto adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever adam called every living creature that was the name thereof you see adam was already demonstrating the authority and the dominion that god had given him in the earth the very name adam means red earth he's from the red dirt and yet his body fashioned in the image and in the likeness of god god himself breathed breath his breath ruach hakodesh the breath of god was breathed into adam and he became a living soul he was connected now to his atmosphere around him by the soul the soul connected spirit and flesh together and the senses of the soul gave adam the ability to be in contact with the environment around him now god was a good god to make adam have the ability through the spirit to be connected to him and through the soul to be connected to the environment and the atmosphere around him god's just a good god isn't he let's bow our heads father we thank you today that you are god's sovereign you are god's supreme last sunday it was raining on the outside this sunday it's been raining on the inside how we want to thank you for that holy reign we're just not ashamed of your presence or how we respond we just do the best we can and what might have been observed today across the internet it was really us trying to behave ourselves if we should ever really turn loose then even the molecules of our body would be changed and we would be raptured out of here in a glorious translation power we look forward to that day where every molecule of this body will speed up and we will be changed from all that is of the earth to all that is of the heavenly oh god help us today as we study your word the people have experienced you but in that experience our bodies get tired and we may already be a little weary in mind but we need to feast on the living word of god today because a feeling like we had in worship will come and it will fade but when we come under the inspiration of revelation the stimulation that it provides is not momentarily and it never expires but it builds us into a higher and higher resurrection life we ask for your help today in the name that is above every name the name of our messiah the lord jesus christ and the church said you may be seated this morning to all of our wonderful friends around the world we bless you today for streaming this service and we have folks from ghana and indiana and washington and kentucky we see more from indiana we see some rather local we we see some i don't know i just can't remember to be honest with you where some of these precious folks are from tucson is represented more than once belgium is represented brazil is represented trinidad is represented in netherlands south africa if you're watching on facebook or on youtube why don't you just put in your country i know i shouldn't remember it but i don't i see that a sister has identified herself let me see if i can as part of an end time message congregation in israel god bless you you're particularly dear to our heart we appreciate you being here with us through the stream now we just read the scripture how that god created adam in his own image and in his likeness he fashioned him from the earth but he lay there just a shell of a man he wasn't able to do what god did he just lay there in the image of god but god wasn't finished with creation he came himself he bowed low he breathed his own breath into the nostrils of adam and adam became a living soul this i said just a moment ago connected to the father by his spirit connected to the world around him and to his own flesh through the five senses of his soul if you're listening today and you need to to exchange those you can do that because i know that people have different ideas i just choose to call it like the scripture said body soul spirit we're just using the order that's in the scripture but you can if you need to flip those words for your understanding you can certainly do that but i'm so glad that god gave us spiritual senses to be connected to him in spirit because there's a fellowship that doesn't come flesh to spirit it must be spirit to spirit you don't understand that until you've experienced it like benjamin was testifying a minute ago until you felt that until you have experienced that it may look like the craziest thing that you've ever seen but once you have tasted it one time for yourself you'll never be satisfied with dry dusty religion you'll never be satisfied with form or fashion you'll never be satisfied with man's religion again once you taste the real and i want you to know he's very much real he is very much alive when god created adam in the earth he gave him dominion over all the things that were on the earth by the power of the spoken word adam exercise that dominion in whatever way was necessary perhaps eve you know how a wife can be eve was probably sitting out on the patio one one day and uh taking a little little breather maybe you know just enjoying the beauty of what god had made there was there was work in the garden but not labor there's a difference if you enjoy what you're doing there's no toil involved and so there was no toil involved in everything that adam and eve did the bible said that adam was placed there to tin the garden so he was doing something he wasn't just watching at all he was doing something but there was such fulfillment in doing what god had created him to do and in exercising order and dominion over creation he was so joyful to be able to do that there was no sweat there was no toil there was no real hard effort involved one day eve is sitting on the back patio perhaps and and she's thinking in her mind you know like a woman does in the living room i don't know if it's like this at your house but i can go to work and come home and we've remodeled couch is moved chairs moved just when you get used to it brother steve just like you want it i need a little table there for my water bottle i need certain things and then you come home and i guess i shouldn't complain because i don't come home and meet a honey-do list where she said can you move that there can you move that there can you do that she just gets in and makes sure it's done she just does it herself i'm kind of thinking that eve liked to rearrange things and i'm thinking that maybe eve was sitting on the back patio uh one evening and she thought my if i only had an orange tree closer to the patio so that i don't have to go out so far it's about 50 yards out through there to pick an orange how i would love to relax here on the chase lounge and just be able to reach up from my chair and pick me a fresh orange and just peel it and enjoy it and she said adam can you put me an orange tree right there butt it up right against the patio oh of course dear i can how many of you know adam didn't need a shovel he didn't need to go down to the to the nursery to buy an orange tree he didn't have to buy fertilizer he didn't have to get out the garden cart he didn't have to put on the gloves he didn't have to do all that he just said sure dear where did you say you would like it and because he was given dominion he just spoke the word i don't know where that orange tree came from it might have been out in the woods somewhere out in the but i want you to know it plucked itself somebody said i can't accept that don't matter whether you accept it or not it's the order of god's creation it just pulled up his roots somebody said no wonder you're talking about narnia where the trees move oh i feel good anyway that tree just poked up picked up its roots just scooted right over there and adam said there and that tree just shot its roots down into that dirt smile the big old smile because he knew that the one who had been given dominion over him had had utilized that authority and dominion and placed him now where a son of god wanted him to be anybody with me you mean you really believe such a thing as that with all my heart i in fact i just read to you in 219 but out of the very ground god took the ground from the ground and he began to create every beast every elephant every tiger every lion satan is not a creator god was creating he was using adam who was an amateur god made in the image and the likeness of god filled with the very zoe life of god speaking the mind of god isn't that powerful that's what it was and so he just god began to create these animals and they're just roaming around and and adam and eve are just sitting on the patio watching a big old elephant walk by swinging in his trunk i wonder what that eve said adam wonder what that is i don't know i don't know the kind of time came and they looked out and there was a line of animals they were lined up as far as the eye could see it was like a prayer line in a brother ran a meeting just as far as the eye could see they were lined up to pass by the son of god to find out what their name was is that not right because god brought those beasts of the field to adam and god didn't say adam look at what he said he brought them unto adam to see what he would call them god didn't whisper adam call it a tiger god just let adam do some uh exercising some dominion here and god adam said i'm gonna call that a tiger and god said that is exactly what i was going to call it adam said i think i'll call that thing there an elephant and god said that is exactly what i was going to call it and you say how in the world is that possible because adam was created in the image and likeness of god filled with the very zoy life the very ruach breath of god he had the mind of god he had the voice to speak for god he was filled with the power of the spoken word you do understand that if there hadn't been an orange tree available he could have made one because the creator was in his mouth you remember what brother branham said about the power of the spoken word and how that little bride would have that authority in the last days how she would depend on thus saith the lord and without the saith the lord she would keep still but when thus saith the lord would drop down on her she would be able to speak the mind of god the creative spoken word of god and everything would have to obey that somebody said i just can't quite get my brain around that well you might ought to because it's part of your inheritance and i'm happen to believe not only when we live in millennium and not only when we leave this world in rapture but i happen to believe that there will be a fully mature bride of sons there'll be a fully mature body of sons on the earth in the last days that's genderless that's not male or female if if men can be the bride then sisters can be part of sons it's two sides of the same paradigm and that full authority that comes to us through the completed adoption will be exercised out of our mouth and when this little bride goes forth in the power of the spoken word listen i'm not one of those who says one of these days when it comes or or what they used to like to say when it's restored i want you to know i'm not waiting for it i'm waiting for permission i don't want to venture without authority i want to know when the season is when the hour is you won't have to go looking for it or sit around waiting on it because the word has restored it in our day anybody with me the spoken word has been restored in our day brother branham saw it in his own ministry at least five separate designated times and then every one of those times god gave him authority over certain facets of creation one of those was healing before the doctor's hand ever touches your body that tumor is going to disappear how many of you think that could come in handy he spoke the word and god did exactly what he spoke old sister had he write hattie mosher she had two sons as you well know that were rebellious boys just in the beginning of teens and they were already rebelling and they weren't as interested in what she was interested in brother branham is sitting around the table there and he is giving the story of how god had come down there in the hollow in kentucky and created squirrel in such a way brother branham was giving god a hard time at it you know he didn't make it easy [Music] he chose to put a squirrel in a place where a squirrel wouldn't normally run and and god did it just like he put the ram in the thicket for abraham god did it that day somebody said you don't really believe that do you with all my heart yes i believe two different times he exercised that creation ability to speak a squirrel into existence and it appeared can anybody think of a time that that might be coming in handy in the latter days these last days that we live here on the earth it might be a very important thing to know that god can do through you i hope i'm not saying too much for you and he's sitting around that little table and they're sharing these testimonies and sister weems and sister royale hold up your hand sisters because there's some that may not know exactly who you are but these sisters knew sister hattie wright very well and sister royale spent the night at sister hattie's house and so you know we can get up and tell testimonies of which we have no connection to but doesn't it make it even more special when someone you know knew the sister and knew what god did i'm assuming you met the sons i'm assuming you met those boys as well sister hattie is listening carefully while while trying to to serve the table and she is hearing carefully what brother branham is describing about this creation and she said just a very ignorant woman just a very a country woman they didn't even raise their children with indoor plumbing they didn't have any indoor plumbing until the deacons at the branham tabernacle got together and put them some plumbing in their home they were still using an outhouse i got to tell the story she you know used uh newspapers for her tablecloths and she had layers of newspaper on the table and would just when one got soiled she'd just rip it off and and there would be another well sister royale was just a young girl about how old would she have been just a teenager and she spent the night there with sister hattie and they they had served squash pie i think it was and sister royale wasn't real fond of squash pie i think i might would have liked it i might have had a little trouble with the possum or something but i i think i could have eaten the squash pie sister royale took a little piece of that and she and she tucked it under the new some of the layers of the newspaper and i think it came out and she felt bad about doing it and sister had he said oh honey she said i don't care about the squash pie i just hate it messed up my my newspapers that's just how simple she was but she heard that i don't know whether she fully understood it or not but she heard it and something in her inner being lived with joy because that day in her kitchen jesus christ had updated himself and the god of the bible had become a living reality and she said my if god is doing that for abraham and now he's doing it in our day and the next thing you know she screamed out brother branham that ain't nothing but the truth that was her amen she could not theologically dissect the hermeneutics or homiletics of that happening she didn't know how to to break it down and chain the scriptures together and present it but all she knew was something something on the inside of her said that ain't nothing but the truth that anointing of god fell down on brother branham as he's telling about one of the experiences of the spoken word there was the storm that was calmed later there was a little fish that was given his life back resurrection power lays in the spoken word authority over the elements lays in the spoken word creation power lays in the spoken word you with me and then all of a sudden that anointing falls on brother branham just like it did out there on the lake when he stood up and looked at that little sunfish and said i give you your life little fishy i give you your life somebody said that's about the silliest little story i've ever heard you know what it may be to you but it says to me that the very power of the resurrection will abide in the little bride of jesus christ in the last days and death will not be able to stand before her you see i'm one of those that believe the devil can't take me before my time i happen to believe in the sovereignty of god and i'm hoping and believing that if i should leave here by some by some chance before my time has come i'm hoping and praying that you will raise up i'll try to do the same for you if we sense it's not your time yet i pray somebody will raise up and say i give you your life in the name of jesus christ somebody said you wouldn't expect anything to happen would you i would i would jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever can anybody say anything amen and so that anointing fell on brother branham and he stood up and he said god is going to give you the desire of your heart i'm paraphrasing this she didn't even know what to ask in one of the tellings she said brother branham i don't even know what to ask for brother branham said she could have asked for 10 million dollars and it would have fell out of the ceiling and into her lap just telling you what he said she was a poor woman she could have used some of that money edith anne her sister was a crippled she had a lot of things wrong with her and her mom and dad were still alive at that time and they were invalid almost and and so all these different things were going on in her mind and and she's having this little conversation with brother adam and standing in the doorway hear this if you've got some lost loved ones hear this if you've got some backsliders in your family hear this and standing in the door of that old country home where were her two sons and they were laughing and they were making fun charity you might put their you might be able to find their picture there and put it up we've done it in the past you might be able to put the picture of the boys up maybe there's there's a picture of him standing side by side and there's also one a picture of one of them getting baptized they're standing there in the door and they're snickering brother branham called him a name what did he snicker fritz how in the world do you remember that you remember me reading that in africa he said there were just two little snicker fritts i'm not sure what the glossary term on that is or you but i kind of get it two little snicker fritz voice standing there making fun of this religious talk and sister hattie looks over and sees him carrying on that way and she said oh brother branham i want the salvation of my two boys oh there they are that's sister hattie in the middle and her two sons standing beside her at the old tabernacle i want the salvation of my two boys and brother branham under the inspiration of that anointing said i give them to you in the name of the lord jesus christ somebody said ha-ha-ha-ha-ha somebody said how is that possible did brother branham save him no he called them to salvation and the spirit of conviction fell in that room on those boys and they weren't praying they were laughing they were making fun and all of a sudden they come under that conviction power and they're standing three minutes ago in the doorway laughing and making fun and now they are both laying over their mother's lap weeping and repenting and asking jesus to come into their life is anybody with me [Applause] you see i believe that there are those out there held in unbelief for this season [Applause] we've prayed for them and we've prayed for them and we've prayed for them but they're being held and i know i even know the reason why some of them have been held because you and i have been on such a long journey here through church you see we had to get through church before we could know who we are in the kingdom we've been making our way through the church ages god's been calling us from one baptism to another baptism to another baptism and we've been walking in our spiritual journey through the church ages getting closer and closer to the restoration of all things the first time i heard about jesus was from a baptist grandmother but my baptist grandmother didn't take me all the way she could only bring me so far they took me to sunday school at the baptist church and her sister was my sunday school teacher and it was there that i sung for the first time my prayer come into my heart come into my heart lord jesus but i couldn't stay in that little first grade kindergarten sunday school class the rest of my life god had to lead me he led me a little higher and he baptized me with the holy ghost when i was seven years old filled me with his glory and called me to preach and sent me to do a work for him that was getting me closer i don't want to give my testimony this morning but he took me closer and closer and closer we're making our way through the church ages we're coming from baptism to baptism we're moving from one glory to another glory one faith to another faith one strength to another strength then we heard the message when i heard this message of truth it changed my life forevermore it cost me more friends than i even knew i had didn't even know i had that many friends till i lost them it cost me it cost me it'll cost you too it'll cost you if you believe the bible if you believe that a second book of acts is being written in this hour like i do it'll cost you it'll cost you something you may not be called a snicker fritz but you'll be called a holy roller just recently i heard about a sister who uh someone said about her they said well i they heard that she'd been drinking from the well down here and somebody said about her i don't know as conservative if she is i don't know how in the world she could you know get involved in all of that noise all that carrying on or whatever the expression was a church like that or whatever it was if that's the worst thing that's ever said about that little lady she'll be all right but i tell you it won't be they'll say that about you they'll say more about you you'll have to sing the little song i've been singing all my life folks may false accuse me and scandalize my name but i'm going on with jesus you see we're just making a journey we're following the pillar of fire anybody with me getting closer all the time and i thought i had found it all when i found the message of the hour and then i and then i bumped into the people people just ruin everything yes we do we can just ruin anything you know people can ruin a good party they can ruin a good chocolate cake don't tell me your health tips while i'm eating chocolate cake wait till i'm done have you no shame i don't drink diet drinks again now anymore i hadn't drank them in years but i used to drink diet drinks i knew they weren't good for me i knew the leaded version wasn't good for me either but i you go off of cokes if you drink a lot of cokes i did then i don't now i did then and you go off of cokes and going to diet cost a little just a little while i lost 10 pounds doing nothing but going off of cokes i knew it wasn't the best i knew i'd read all the articles but i was over in israel i don't remember who was with me i was over in israel and we were witnessing to some croatian brothers and we had baptized them in the bathtub in the name of the lord jesus christ and they're sitting around talking about how bad that diet coke was i wanted to pour it right on his head wait till i'm not thirsty to tell me folks if you if people are involved in something they can just ruin it and so i went through a period of time where i was dissuaded a little bit discouraged because i couldn't see the message producing as much as i thought it should be producing and then i realized i was in the same boat i was still hung somewhere back in pentecost just trying to make my way to a deeper truth come on now we're all on a journey and so you have to get your eyes off of people let me give you three steps to overcoming number one get your eyes off of people keep your eyes on jesus number two get your eyes off people keep your eyes on jesus number three get your eyes on people keep your eyes on jesus that's three steps to overcoming in this last hour it'll work every time get your eyes off of people and get your eyes on jesus because he never fails he never fails well i want you to know there came a time that adam's authority and dominion over that garden you know how sweet it was i'm not here to talk about that you know how wonderful that fellowship was god himself came down in the cool of every evening and had this glorious fellowship with adam and eve oh my can you imagine walking with him in the stillness of the garden oh having such sweet fellowship we know how sweet it is when we get in his presence around here but all to think about him coming and lingering i i often think about what it would have been like for adam and eve when when when papa said i'm going now oh don't go away papa sit with us a little while longer come on now sit with us a little while longer just give us 10 more minutes you don't really have to go the whole universe is running while you're sitting here fellowshipping oh please don't go but the bible said he didn't and he did it for a reason it every reason he had an appointment he kept disappointment i can see adam and eve running out naked as they came into the earth running out to meet papa when he would come they're waiting on him they're ready to see him oh papa it's so good you're here we're so glad you're here we're looking forward to this evening of fellowship come on neither one of them even realized that they were naked because they were covered with god's great cosmic light the light was just emanating they only had knowledge of good they only knew the good they only knew the god they had not yet tasted of that tree that gave them the ability to see that there's something else it was all they knew they were naked and not ashamed anybody with me and then all of a sudden you know what happened satan entered in to that creature that beast of the of the garden of eden who walked upright like a man looked like a man had reasoning ability it seems but he had no soul satan was not going to be able to inject himself into mankind and so he had to find a way and he found a willing vessel may i remind you one that was created for that purpose may i help you to understand that god created the beast that would we would understand to be the serpent and he created him knowing exactly that he would volunteer and make himself available the same god created judas knowing that judas was going to betray the lord come on now the same god that created evil in the first place according to the prophet of the old testament and he did that to drive us closer to his bosom not to pull us further away anybody's still here this morning and so you know what happened there was an act that took place in the garden you can you can you know you can figure that out on your own or we'll talk to you about it i'm not ashamed to preach about it i just don't want to throw people this morning because that's not where we're going but i'll tell you what it boiled down to it boiled down to believe ah eve believing a lie she couldn't understand why god would lie to them it opened the door and she began to listen to reasoning and reasoning will take you further and further away from the presence of god every time somebody say every time you've got to get human reasoning shut down and you've got to approach god with faith you can never approach god with human reasoning you'll never get anywhere but if you'll rep if you will approach him with faith you'll be able to understand as he reveals himself to you is that right and so you know the reasoning was there and she began to to believe and he began to introduce to her a way for a higher life you you you just listen to me and i'll take you to a higher place when i'm done you'll be just like god she didn't realize that she had come forth from the one that was made in the image and in the likeness of god she didn't understand that she was hidden in the original creation she just didn't have it all figured out she was a byproduct of the man you know that every time a copy is made it gets further away from the original identity and she was created and left with a vulnerability so that she could believe this lie she gave herself to the lie she received a seed that was not adam's twins were born to her one of a righteous seed one of another seed the new testament talks about cain who was of that evil one we know how it happened from that moment on they were both forced to deal with the knowledge that for everything good there is a counterfeited evil and they started mankind not only themselves but they started mankind on a journey that you and i are still walking on today forced to choose every day of our lives as anybody here even the righteous redeemed of the lord we are forced every day of our life to make the decision to follow the god and the knowledge of good or to follow the knowledge of evil no one's looking i could just cheat no one would really know i could just lie and no one would ever figure it out i could just do such and such and such and mankind is still on that journey you know that wasn't the saddest part really of all that happened that day there was something more more more sad than that and that is the fact that that adam held in the beginning the title deed of heaven and earth and in that title deed of heaven and earth the plan of redemption was written think about it and adam held it in his own arms and when this took place the bible tells us that adam was not deceived new testament eve was deceived but adam knew exactly what he was doing she gave to him and he did it also why because he was fulfilling a prophetic story that you and i would one day become a part of he took his wife's sin he placed himself in that sin he was marred and changed by her unbelief forever his destiny would be adjusted from what he had expected but he did it to cover her he did it so that she could find a place again hiding in him she came from adam and now by this glorious redemptive act she could hide in adam again god was going to take care of both of them isn't that the goodness of god and so they go on you know you know i didn't even mean this morning when i was looking i didn't mean to go into this there's there's much more to go into but i guess we maybe needed to for some reason and they get down and all of a sudden it's looking about time in the garden for for papa to come the light's gone now that covered them both they've seen things about each other that they didn't realize that they didn't know about before and the first thing they do when they find out and you listen carefully the first thing they do when they find out it's about time for papa to come again they see their own nakedness they're now very much aware of their own freckles they know everything about their bodies and for some reason because of what took place the world will tell you they ate an apple if that were the truth and why didn't they put on masks like you and i did for two years and walk around when papa came down they didn't cover their mouths they covered their sexual organs with little aprons made from fig leaves that's what the bible tells us because this was where the shame came amen this is how the seed entered and this is how the shame came so they made it can you imagine trying to hide from papa with little fig aprons wrapped around their bodies like bikinis any good virtuous woman knows better than to expose her nakedness like that i don't want to see your knees i sure don't want to see the rest of you anybody with me i don't want to see the back of your leg i want you to pin up your split or sew it up i want you to remember who you are when we go out here in this world we've got to remember who we are we're reflecting the light it's not our light jesus is the light he lives in me and so they started trying to hide they're hiding over there in the bushes can you imagine hiding in the bushes with the little little fig aprons on when when when when yesterday about the same time they ran out into the clearing oh papa we're so glad you've come and now they're over there hiding in the bushes with little little fig leaf aprons on and god comes calling out to adam adam where are you you've never missed an appointment before you've never missed our fellowship hour before where are you you think god didn't know where he was you think god didn't know what happened you know adam was hiding over there in the bush because he thought that god had come to kill him people are afraid because they feel like that god is out to kill them he's out to destroy them well the truth is both god and the devil want to kill you now won't that be a theological masterpiece just for different reasons god wants to kill your old man so the new man can live and satan wants to kill you because he wants to take you clean out of god's economy so either way you're a dead man you might as well just surrender and let god kill the very nature of the flesh the very nature of the serpents the very nature of the beast so that the nature of christ can live and rule and reign in you oh my god we're almost out of genesis 3. we haven't got the revelation yet where david was reading to us you just can't whisper those words david those words when i hear somebody read that like david did that last time i tell you it reverberates in all of who i am i'm here today i'm here today let me tell you something brother i'm here today because the lion prevailed i'm here today because the lion of the tribe of judah prevailed [Applause] you know what god did he wasn't there to kill him he was there to cover them he was there to put clothes on them give me the verse brother give me the verse somebody find me the verse i wasn't even going to read this give me the verse where he comes to clothe them and let me read it some people looked at me like they didn't remember give me 321 pretty please it's just 119. we're good unto adam also and to his wife you know why i like to read this because there are people who study the bible their whole life and have never caught this verse i've had people tell me you i never i never knew that was in the bible i remember standing in my bookstore when i owned a little bookstore before i was married i remember standing there one day and talking to these baptist people about the fact that the scripture said adam was not deceived he was well aware of the transgression he knew exactly what was happened happening but but that evil deceived and they said well that must be in the old testament i said well i know it's right here in the new testament let me show you this woman said i've been an adult sunday school teacher for 40 years and i never even knew that verse was in the bible so maybe there'd be somebody watching this didn't know this verse is in the bible unto adam also and to his wife eve did the lord god make what coats of skins and clothed them you're still with me i don't know what it looked like brother i don't know exactly how it looked like i don't know if he pulled i pulled a sword machine out of his cloak all i know is he said he made them coats of skins but i know this if i know anything about skinning something it's going to be a bloody mess and it's going to cost something it's life can you imagine god eternal picking up some little woolly sheep and taking them in his own hands slaying them and ripping the skin off of their body blood everywhere and making adam and eve coats to cover their nakedness and they're just melting adam and eve are melting in the presence of papa once they realized that he didn't come to kill them he came to cover them they're just melting in it they can't hardly believe that he's not there to kill them but instead he's there to cover them that's the god i serve go tell the world that the god we serve wants to cover you [Applause] but he cannot do it without the shedding of blood blood has to be shed little animals had to give their lives i tell you i want to talk in tongues but i'm preaching in english i love to hear brother branham tell it he tells us so much better than i after this great family time has come to an end and papa says you have to leave you know you have to leave now right you can't live here anymore let me remind you what the scripture tells us the scripture tells us that that eden was not just a garden eden was a land eden was a region that god had created and we know we know we don't know the exact dimensions but we know a little bit about it because of the rivers that the bible tells us run through the land of eden and in the land of eden was a garden and adam and eve were living in the garden of eden they weren't banished from the land they were banished from the garden and the reason why there were if there were two trees in the garden of great spiritual significance one was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil one was the tree of life the tree of life was placed in the garden to represent jesus christ in a pre-adamic existence and adam and eve would have been able to make their way at any time to that tree of life and also eat of its fruit had they not been banished from the garden do you know if they would have done that our redemption would have been at stake they would have had eternal life you and you and i would have had no hope so god just scoots someone out i can't imagine what that would be like to feel the warm embrace and love of abba and then all of a sudden be told but you know you can't live at home don't you you've got to go live somewhere else brother branham tells it much better than i could he said i can see them there making their way out of the garden with bloody skins slapping the back of their legs as they go covering them but mankind would never be the same again adam would have never died eve would have lived forever but now death had been entered death had been brought into the equation all a part of god's economy but i can't help but think about what would have been what could have been the worst part of it all was adam who held dominion and authority over the earth including possession of the title deed he lost that in the fall and it went back into the hands of the original owner the original creator god is anybody with me sixth seal for me just a moment and i'm gonna i i'm gonna i'm gonna be done it too if you need to go out to the washroom you can do that quickly and come back with us this is my birthday sunday i would rather preach than have a present there's nothing i'd rather do on if i could have a day if a day was dedicated to me and they said do what you enjoy the most the best birthdays i've ever had in my life are the ones i spent preaching the gospel and there's been a bunch of them there have been 40 48 i might not have preached on the day but on the weekend of or close to that there have been there have been about 48 of those and i'm looking forward to more until he comes 126 compare scriptures of this great event that we will see that this great secret or mystery that was under the sixth seal of the book of redemption now remember these are hidden mysteries stay with me and the sixth seal all together in one is one great big book just six scrolls rolled together this was the book that that david was talking about in the scripture this morning and the girls were singing about it's not a book it's not a codex but it's scrolls that were rolled together sealed with seven seals brother branham said just six scrolls rolled together and it unwinds the whole book of redemption that's how the all earth the whole earth was redeemed let me tell you this plan of redemption was not just for the lost soul of man it was for every part of god's creation including the earth that we walk on you don't have to worry your pretty head about global warming it's not your your suv that's causing any problem it's what sin is doing to the environment and right around the corner he's going to renovate it all anyway he'll redeem every bit of the earth as we know it have you ever thought about what it'll be like in that hour when the lion lays down next to the lamb and your little child plays on the hole of a poisonous snake and nobody grabs his hand the wolf is gentle nothing to be afraid of the whole earth and all creation is redeemed i'm glad i know i'm a part of that he goes on uh six scrolls roll together it unwinds the whole book of redemption that's how the whole earth was redeemed that's the reason john wept you heard it this morning because if no one could get that book all creation everything was gone she would just simply turn back to atoms and molecules and so forth and cosmic light and not even be creation per person nothing else nothing not a person left nothing else because adam lost the rights of that book he forfeited when he listened to his wife and she listened to satan's reasonings instead of the word of god see it was forfeited brother sister always pays to listen to the word of god if you believe that same man now let's go to the breach between the seals and the church ages paragraph 99 i'm hurrying but i want to read this now when adam sinned by heeding his wife's reasoning instead of holding listen we're not here to blame eve i i don't have any animosity to towards she did exactly what she was created to do she had to do such a thing as that just like judas had to do what judas did what would have happened if the lord hadn't been betrayed would happen if eve hadn't listened to the enemy like she did oh eve he i mean adam he was tempted to throw her completely under the bus wasn't he first thing he started stammering when god started asking questions it's that woman you give me oh husbands let me see if i can find me some oh husbands don't you do that don't you do that don't you throw that woman under the bus don't you blame her for your problem amen someone recently said they were afraid of me because i was angry i was i don't get that way often but i was angry but there was no need to be afraid of me i've never caused anybody physical harm that i know of except except benjamin joshua leaving mariah they weren't crippled they weren't they weren't really bruised the worst thing i ever did was by mistake i i took joshua one time he was so aggravating i know you find that hard to believe ha ha and and i don't know i was we were out and somewhere and i just i just grabbed a little bit of hair like that and i just pulled that's all i it really wasn't even violent i didn't i just did that just for him to have a little feeling which for me it kind of feels good he jerked i tried to figure out how to put it back i sure was embarrassed at what i had done it was not not in vicious man i'm not a violent person like that but there are certain things that can push you i i want you to be very careful how you blame that woman you gave me someone recently said to me through email i'm struggling with pornography that doesn't shock me it doesn't it doesn't upset me it doesn't make me angry i understand that it's a struggle of this age i feel sorry for people who are so naive to think that only men are caught up in that but maybe mostly men but it's not all men the reason for that is because uh that is how a man is stimulated is through his eyes and the enemy sure does take advantage of that so i just got ready in my mind to start ministering what i would minister to someone so i'm already ready to type to minister to this brother to see if i could help him to come out from under condemnation and get help because the lord is there to set him free from that it's an addiction and it will destroy your life and all of a sudden i read the last line and i wanted to slug him that's why i said i'm not normally a violent person i wanted to slug him he was doing so well he was confessing his wrong and explaining how the enemy had had brought such a bondage and such an addiction and then the last line he blamed his wife brother i'm done i'm done at that point i didn't give him the standard answers and lead him down the road i generally lead people down that way the first thing i said to him was you can't even be delivered until you realize that no one is responsible for your sin but you you've got to own that now i know what brother branham said he said a woman ought to cover up she should a man ought to be wear big enough genes too we ought to be modest in the way that we present ourselves i know that brother branham said and the scripture teaches that modesty is right and that a woman shouldn't show her underneath garment shouldn't be out there for a man to imagine and so forth and etc i don't believe that's right brother branham said when you dress like that you potentially have already committed a sex act so i believe we ought to be careful about that but i'm not going to sit around and let anybody male or female blame somebody else for their sin i said brother nobody's making you go back nobody's causing you to look for that no one is doing that except you're yielding to the lie well this was about a month ago and for three weeks i didn't hear a thing back from that brother not one word and i said i don't care if i don't ever hear from him again if i can't tell him the truth this past monday i opened up my email he sent me an email and he said i've been so mad at you for three weeks i've almost cussed that's mad he said and then all of a sudden i was listening to a sermon and in that sermon i realized that what you were telling me was right and i'm ready to repent and i'm ready to own my sin so that jesus can set me free and you know what i believe god has done that i believe god's done that for that brother so so adam he started trying to it's that woman you give me you know she's a problem but i don't hold that against adam either because when it came time to do the right thing he had done the right thing so out of the garden they go no longer holding in their hand this great title deed of redemption for the earth let's read the next did we finish the quote we were on now when adam sinned by heeding his wife's reasoning instead of holding god's word that's what made adam sin his wife reasoned with satan and then produced the product to adam and adam turn loose the word and sold out that's an important thing right there and that's what i said to that brother i said you could not embrace that sin unless you first turned loose of god's word you got a rock anybody listening to me you got a rock folks you can't operate in unbelief unless you first turn loose to the word if you take your hands off of god's word then you are a prey you're free pray to the enemy and he'll take full advantage of you you hold on to the rock his wife reasoned with satan and then produced the product to adam and adam turn loose the word and sold out that's never a good thing to do he lost also his inheritance when he lost his fellowship and right to life i want you to understand this too his fellowship was was broken but his relationship was unchanged you better hear me he was still a son he was still a son now if you're a son you'll never thrive without that fellowship you asked tiffany i saw her hand up in the air you asked her she was always one of gods but when you lose that place of fellowship with him you feel as far away from god as anybody possibly could and far away from his people but god just proves to us if you're willing to do the right thing then all you have to do is come back to him and say god i really messed up don't forget to tell him i may really mess up again but i'm throwing myself on your mercy and papa says i've missed our times together i feel led to tell this and i'm going to close i might read it give me just a minute is this the only church you've ever been to where the preacher just leaves it comes back i'm not going to the washroom i might not order going back there because somebody's got a crock-pot in the musician's room and i smelt lunch if i'd have gone back there about 30 minutes ago we might be done by now i'm not i've not lived long enough but it's my birthday week i've not lived long enough to be quoted so i have to quote myself david was talking to me one night this week and he said have you heard your sermon such and such i said no david i haven't i know i should but i haven't it's good somebody's listening i'm going to read this to you it's an experience that i had with the lord it was visionary in incense that i was wide awake it's called fellowship with me i remember a time in when i was serving as pastor to a church in south carolina i was 19 years old at the time living alone in a small rented brick house so i'm 54 this this week i was living alone in a small rented brick house i had made a commitment to meet the lord bright and early every morning beside the sofa in my small living room it was there that i learned the joy of daily communion with him i would use this time to pray and pour out my heart to the lord and then i would worship and wait it was during the waiting that he would speak to me isn't it always that way sometimes with encouragement and sometimes instruction let me just put a put my finger there just a moment and tell you that the the celebration that we had this morning and that we often have when we're here it it'll never take the place it will never take the place of being alone with him it is not a substitute it's another part of being with him oh how his presence come this morning i knew he was here but i didn't know i i wasn't i wasn't feeling you know it's not about a feeling but you you do you do feel you do experience i wasn't experiencing that presence to that degree until i stepped here where benjamin had been singing and then all of a sudden i've but there's nothing to take the place of those times when it's just you and papa you just worship you just tell him how wonderful he is i know you men that won't ever brag on your wives i know you must have a hard time bragging on him but i say the awful things that that some people say they could never say somebody said they could never say it but i often tell him oh jesus you are so beautiful everything about you is beautiful to me sister joyce just quoted you are all together lovely there are no eyes like your eyes there's no face like his face when we stand in the presence of the lord and we get in that moment it may not be that we see a physical image standing before us but his presence becomes so real we can see him we can see him i'm asked all the time do you have you ever seen the lord i've seen the lord yes i'm not ashamed to tell you i've seen the lord in worship i've seen him in prayer time and i saw him when he came to visit me at the age of three years old yes i've seen the lord but those moments when i may not be able to say i physically see him but his presence is so real that i can see and perceive that it's those are the most precious times don't you think that you're going to be able to survive only on what you experience here corporately are you listening you're going to have to have that time with your head and if you're like i said if you're a man that's got an identity crisis you're going to have a hard time with this place of intimacy because you're going to have to find your yourself spiritually with your head on his chest because you're part of a bride and a bride must hear the heartbeat of god we don't just hear what comes out of his mouth we want to know what makes his heart beat and in order to do that we have to pull up as close to him as we possibly can and when i say that my heart yearns because i know there are millions of people out there that if they could only know if they could only know that such an experience was possible it would change so many things about their life even christians if they could only understand that he longs to have fellowship with you are you still with me and then i would worship and wait it was during the waiting that he would speak to me sometimes with encouragement and sometimes instruction during this time in my life i often felt alone it was my first time living away from family and i was pioneering a church in a very difficult city i needed those times of soaking and holy downloads it became the most important part of my day one morning i was rushing out the door i had a daily radio broadcast from a local studio normally there was plenty of time to spend with the lord before i had to be at the station but this morning was different i had to leave early to prepare for an interview that i was going to give on the same station later that day the owner of the station had heard me share a vision on my daily program and had asked me to come and do an interview about it and just for you that know the visions that was the that was the uh bridal army in fatigues and the owner of that station was so fascinated by that he was not a believer but he was so fascinated in that he said i want you to come and let the dj interview you for a couple hours and i want you to tell about that again he said that was if you all will remember correctly that was also part of the same vision where where i saw the preacher in the great uh in the great stadium that had been turned into a church and he was preaching a uh a different jesus it was years later before i saw that man face to face on a television screen and realized that i had seen him in a vision many many many years before he had stepped into that role but anyway so i had to leave early to prepare for an interview later that day the owner of the station had heard i was excited about this two hour long opportunity to share spiritual things and because of this commitment i skipped my regular devotion time beside the sofa i remember being in the shower that morning and saying lord i'll meet you when i come home today i i won't let this day go by i'll meet you when i come home today now i had to leave early i start listen excuse me uh i'd skip my regular devotion time beside the sofa let me just tell you 11 points print used to be good enough now i need 13. though this has to be reprinted i started toward the door when suddenly my briefcase opened spilling all of its contents onto the floor in exasperation i stooped down collecting all my papers and putting them safely back inside i remember thinking how odd that seemed i knew the case was latched and it had never popped open like that before i continued my quest to get out the door when the whole scene repeated i even heard the latch on the briefcase pop open as everything came pouring out after once again shoving all my things into the case i closed the latch and scrambled the digits of the combination lock i still felt like something was amiss but could not discern what it was i walked back through the house checking to make sure everything was in order stove was turned off no faucet was running et cetera grabbing my case for the third time i closed the door behind me taking time to lock the deadbolt of the house i felt sense of accomplishment that i'd finally made it to the front porch i started down the steps and it happened again first the sound of the latch popping open and then every single sheet of paper every pen all the content scattered onto the steps of my little porch i cried out in total frustration and for the third third time crammed everything back into the case it finally dawned on me i'm a slow learner sometime it finally dawned on me that the lord must be trying to speak to me i walked back up the steps and over to the door unlocking it and slowly stepping back inside my little living room there he was waiting for me i saw him a heavenly being of exquisite brightness only the shape of his body was visible as he knelt there in my spot i had sensed his presence many times kneeling there beside me but i had never seen him before i wept throwing my case onto the chair i collapsed beside him i wanted to express my shame but words would not come i wanted to plead my case and tell him how sorry i was for neglecting my special time with him but i was so grieved all i could do was sob speechless he shifted closer to me and i was overshadowed by tender compassionate peace than he spoke you thought this time was only for you but it was also for me i have enjoyed my time of fellowship with you each and every morning i was undone changed forever he wanted to have fellowship with me the one who knew me best yet loved me most with all my weaknesses he desired my fellowship i was overwhelmed the lover of our souls longs to have quiet intimate fellowship with us we must not disappoint him can you say amen let's stand and let the musicians come oh to realize he didn't come to destroy them he come to make clothes for them he came to cover their shame in their nakedness it was expedient that they leave the garden he made sure that they didn't sneak back he placed cherubim angels with flaming swords of fire that turned in every direction like the wheel within the wheel to guard the way they weren't keeping them out of the garden they were keeping them away from the tree of life powerful isn't it and now we're living in this hour and god has once again sent a flaming sword the flaming sword that once was there to keep us away from the tree of life it's now pointed in our direction to invite us back to show us the way to the way think of it and now instead of a thought keep out keep out keep out there's a call that says come up higher revelation 4 1 come up higher i want to show you something that old veil that once was there to keep man out it was so strong and so powerful that they say woven so intricately that they say if you could have if you should have hooked up a yoke of oxen in one direction and in another that that those yoke of oxen would not have been able to pull that veil apart and yet the bible says there he lay on that cross hanging on that cross dying brother branham said the priest could look out the window of the temple and see him there hanging the sacrifice for all mankind and there they were busy about their religiousness doing what they'd always done not even recognizing that hanging out there on the other side of that glass was the very son of god becoming a living sacrifice for all mankind but you see listen they had a different reason for making sure that veil stood in its place because they knew something that the rest of the people didn't know the ark was gone the ark was no longer there and they're the only ones the priesthood had passed it down a couple generations there they're the only ones who knew there was no no no ark there it had been hidden away you remember it had been captured some believed it was taken to ethiopia some believed it was taken to other places and some believe that to this day it's hidden underneath the temple mount i've met with men who believed great archaeologists and scientists who believe both have believed both theories what many people don't realize is that the sages tell us that a duplicate was made and the ark of the covenant that was stolen away was most likely the decoy and that the reality is that piece of furniture probably still exists and is hidden beneath somewhere beneath the temple mount if that were true that would explain some of the contention of what goes on over on that little piece of property even this week it explains the fact that men lost their lives when the temple tunnels were opened up again and brother greeley and several of us i know others here have been with me and we've walked through those temple tunnels we've gone as close to the place where the ark of the covenant sat in solomon's temple as possible but those precious people of second temple period they had no idea that the ark of the covenant was no longer there and if they allowed if they allowed people to see behind that veil then worshipers would have been discouraged and dissuaded and so they kept that veil in place and they kept it a secret from mankind and when jesus came to die he came to open up the way so that all mankind could come behind the veil and he also ripped that veil from top to bottom to expose the hypocrisy of religion to expose their lives and to say it's not about a box anymore it's about the one hanging out there without the camp suffering and giving his life and brother branham told us that after that veil was rent and twain from top to bottom that they took needle and thread sewed it back up to protect their lives and to keep mankind out but there's a bride hallelujah she'll not be kept out by man-made dogmas creeds or traditions she's heard the call of revelation 4-1 come up higher i want to show you some things and she's heard the invitation that says let us therefore come [Music] to the throne of grace to find help in the time of need one more little quotation that i love and i quote it so much while they're getting ready to give us a worship number i love this one so much brother branham says we need to come in to that place to the holiest of holies and we need to stay there until the veil falls behind us does that sound like a flaming sword trying to keep you out no it doesn't sound like that at all to me it sounds like an invitation that says i want you i want to have fellowship with you i want you to come in behind the veil and get to know who i really am that's what it sounds like to me brother adam said you need to stay there till that veil falls behind you shutting you in to the glories of god and shutting out this whole world all that it offers us come on i want to worship him before we have lunch i want to worship him if i can't be preaching i'd like to be worshiping i live for those moments my he's here today he's here he's here [Music] into your embrace draw me my beloved let me look into your face my beloved [Music] [Music] yes let's sing that draw me my beloved into your embrace draw me my beloved [Music] are you

don't know what your identity is i don't know if you'd say i'm an alabamian i'm a i'm an american i come from a middle class family i come from a poor family i come from a rich family i i don't know what your identity would be some people find their identity in their education and some find it in their social status and some find it in their church membership some actually find their identity in satan's lies [Music] and in all of his accusations when he says you're a loser you'll never amount to anything you'll never live a victorious life you'll always be stumbling around in confusion and some people own that and i hear people willingly calling themselves i'm a broken man i'm a broken person listen we've all been broken and we'll be broken again but make sure you don't find your identity in your brokenness make sure that you find your identity in being the loved the loved of the father you are the beloved of the heavenly father he loves you if you want to know who he is he's a good papa he's a good father he's just he's righteous he's holy he's compassionate and if you want to know who you are you are greatly loved you are greatly loved you're greatly loved i want god to make that a reality to you today i want that to become a reality in your life i know if i were to ask how many have needs that many many hands would go up if you want to just slip up your hand i have a need god sees that need there are those who need jobs there are those who are going to yet need housing some others who are looking for a place that will need a place and you you've got some sickness going on and different things happening in your family but i want you to know god's got every bit of it he knows how to move in such a way that no man can hinder his moving and he knows how to baffle our imagination even and do exceedingly abundantly above that which we could even ask or think if you believe that say amen i want us to pray together for each other i want us to pray for every need represented in this house and to all of the streamers who are watching this service right now god sees your need he knows right where you are and he knows how to move for you there's hardly

you are the deliverer and i lift up every need represented in this house right now i lift up every need in the streaming congregation i pray god that to the sick you will manifest yourself as a healer to the confused i pray that you will manifest yourself as the truth to those who are in oppression to those who are living in bondage or addiction i pray that you will manifest yourself even now as the great deliverer the great emancipator the one who comes to set free i pray lord for each person who has a desire right now to be drawn closer to you that they will yield themselves to your pool that they will have grace to yield themselves to the drawing of the lord may they find a relationship with you like they've never known before i pray right now for any person who has who can hear this prayer who feels like their fellowship with god has for some reason been broken or stuffed up i pray right now that a desire for fellowship will overwhelm that individual right now and that a desire will break forth in them like never before to draw up close to you lord i know this i know you reach further down than we can reach up i know that you run faster toward us than we can run toward you
