TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Jesus received a change of clothes just like the priest just like Adam and Eve just like the children of Israel Jesus had a change of clothes he laid aside his royal robe of deity he laid aside his kingly robe he laid aside the glory here's what is very important to remember he laid aside the glory that he had shared with the father from before the beginning of the world the Bible tells us he laid all of that aside and he took on another set of clothes he stepped in to a set of clothes that was of this world come on he conducted himself no longer as the king of all kings but now he moved as a servant I believe that it was not just the glory that he emptied as he moved in his earthly ministry but I believe at the cross he gave up much of the rights much of the authority that he had had as the Word made flesh and I believe that he died as a man I believe that it was absolutely necessary I believe that him that that father that eternal spirit of the Father that was with him was with him all the way Crouse even though we had already laid aside much of the glory that he had had with the father in the beginning but still the deity was there the very eternal spirit of the father was in him and there on the cross god can't die he couldn't die as a god how many of you understand that he could only die as someone who can die a man can die but God can't die and so the spirit of the Father I believe it was as though I almost ripped from him and he felt it and it was it was necessary but he take off the old road and put on another one to be able to pay the price for you and I so it is not it is not unfair for him to ask you and I also to take off some old stuff so that we can be filled with some new stuff so that we can be clothed with a new reality it's not a Baptist sunday-school story it's what makes you a new creature it's what gives you a new identity it's what gives us hope that this life is not the end and so if the word of the Lord should come to us sanctify yourselves wash your clothes change your garment it's he's not asking us the Spirit of God he's not bidding us to do anything better Jesus was not required to do
