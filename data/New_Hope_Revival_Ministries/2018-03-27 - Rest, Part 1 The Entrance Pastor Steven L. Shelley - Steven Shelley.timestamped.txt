[0:12] Ascended life the supernatural life from
[0:15] the realm of the Spirit
[0:20] [Music]
[0:24] but I've got good news for you and that
[0:27] is God by nature is a redeemer
[0:30] [Music]
[0:36] is surrendering our mind to the word
[0:39] that's what makes the big difference
[0:41] that's the great mystery right I Christ
[0:43] in you the hope a lord
[0:45] [Music]
[1:00] hello I greet you in the name of the
[1:02] Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah
[1:05] it's just a wonderful privilege to be
[1:08] able to come to you again at this time
[1:10] I'm Pastor Steven Shelley of New Hope
[1:13] revival ministries in Smith Station
[1:16] Alabama and I'm also representing today
[1:18] brother Eric Erickson and the staff of
[1:21] the gospel channel we're just thankful
[1:23] for the partnership that God has given
[1:25] us with them anything that we can do to
[1:29] be a blessing to them we want to and
[1:32] anything that we can do to be a blessing
[1:34] to you and that excites us very much
[1:37] we're thankful for all the feedback that
[1:39] you've been giving us and can I just
[1:42] invite you to keep it up and maybe even
[1:45] increase it because it's such an
[1:47] encouragement to us to hear from you we
[1:51] sit here in front of this camera
[1:53] believing in faith that someone is on
[1:56] the other end and when we hear from a
[1:59] warm body it's exciting it lets us know
[2:02] that the message is getting out and that
[2:05] what we do is not in vain and we just
[2:08] greet you all we are thankful to hear
[2:10] from you we're praying over your prayer
[2:13] requests we take that serious I feel
[2:16] like it's a privilege that the Lord
[2:18] would give us this opportunity to pray
[2:20] for you on the other side of the pond
[2:23] and around the world we had a prayer
[2:25] request come in this week from Rome
[2:27] Italy so we're thankful that the gospel
[2:30] channel is reaching even into Italy so
[2:34] let us know where you're watching and if
[2:37] the program is a blessing to you let us
[2:40] know and either way we'd be more than
[2:43] happy to pray for your prayer requests
[2:45] and we invite you as believers to help
[2:48] us pray for the gospel channel that God
[2:51] will continue to meet their needs
[2:53] financially and spiritually so that they
[2:56] can continue to be there for you when
[3:00] you need them and we want to be there
[3:02] for you as well I know that you can
[3:05] imagine the terrible expense large
[3:10] Vence of bringing the gospel channel to
[3:14] you whether it's directly by satellite
[3:17] or through your cable provider or the
[3:20] the Sky box or however it is that you're
[3:23] watching the program it is expensive and
[3:25] we want you to continue to pray and give
[3:29] and partner with the gospel channel and
[3:32] I have a desire a prayer request that
[3:35] I'm laying before the Lord I want to see
[3:38] the doors open for the gospel channel to
[3:41] even expand their outreach and there are
[3:45] a couple of other satellites I'm asking
[3:47] the Lord for a couple of the regions of
[3:49] the world that I would like to know that
[3:51] we're having an impact and so join us in
[3:54] that if you will I want to share a
[3:57] portion of Scripture with you today and
[3:59] we've been focusing on for some time now
[4:03] the Word of God it's so precious I'm so
[4:07] thankful I'm thankful to the men that
[4:09] God used down through the ages the Holy
[4:13] Spirit moved upon them they spoke and
[4:17] wrote under the inspiration of the Holy
[4:20] Spirit and in many cases there were
[4:23] faithful scribes you know armor bearers
[4:27] we call them sometime who traveled with
[4:30] the Apostles even the prophets of the
[4:32] Old Testament and in many cases they
[4:36] acted ascribes the man of God would be
[4:39] moved upon by the Holy Spirit and he
[4:42] would actually speak dictate for
[4:45] instance in the case of the Apostle Paul
[4:47] letters would be dictated and even many
[4:51] many theologians and those who study the
[4:54] scriptures believe that Moses also would
[4:57] have used to scribe and he would speak
[5:00] under the inspiration of the Lord and a
[5:02] faithful servant would write it down and
[5:05] record it I'm thankful I have to be
[5:08] honest with you I'm thankful for every
[5:11] person that was used throughout history
[5:13] to help preserve for us the written
[5:16] record of God's Word and then we think
[5:19] about those who sacrifice their lives
[5:21] their families live
[5:24] to translate the scriptures to bring
[5:27] them from the original languages and
[5:30] even out of the Greek so that we could
[5:33] read them in a language that we could
[5:35] understand how many of you are thankful
[5:37] that we have the Word of God in our
[5:40] native tongues I know many of you
[5:44] watching this program English is your
[5:46] native language but for some of you
[5:48] English is not your first language
[5:51] second language may be or it's your
[5:53] third language but but even in other
[5:57] languages throughout Africa and India
[6:00] and parts of Asia where there are not
[6:03] only numerous languages but dialects
[6:06] aren't we grateful that God has allowed
[6:09] his word to be translated in those
[6:11] languages some of the translations are
[6:14] not perfect but the Word of God that
[6:17] they're touching is perfect and we have
[6:20] it you know there was a time that we had
[6:24] all of these and I still have mine you
[6:27] know the the the printed record the
[6:30] study Bibles of all the different
[6:32] languages and the different study
[6:34] methods and well I would almost be
[6:37] ashamed to tell you how many copies of
[6:38] the Bible itself I have and now we're
[6:42] living in such an hour that we can have
[6:44] it on our computer we can even have it
[6:46] in the palm of our hand not one
[6:48] translation but hundreds of translations
[6:51] available god is good this is a good
[6:54] time to focus our lives and build our
[6:58] lives around the Word of God because
[7:00] it's so readily available and let me
[7:03] remind you that the letter itself the
[7:07] written record of God's Word if it's
[7:10] read and we we seek to understand it
[7:13] only from a natural perspective without
[7:16] allowing the Holy Spirit to make it a
[7:19] revelation to us it can get kind of dry
[7:23] and dusty there are many more pieces of
[7:27] literature articles to read maybe you're
[7:31] interested in science maybe you're
[7:33] interested in the latest gossip of the
[7:36] royal family
[7:37] there's so many things that can catch
[7:39] our attention and we can get wrapped up
[7:42] in them and and if the Bible has only
[7:45] been sort of a book to us it may not
[7:49] take a high priority on our list it may
[7:52] be in fact one of the last things we get
[7:55] around to so I encourage you again and
[7:58] I'll probably encourage you the next
[8:01] time we're together to allow the Holy
[8:04] Spirit approach God in prayer and allow
[8:07] the Holy Spirit to take this written
[8:10] record of God's Word and make it more
[8:12] than just another book on your shelf or
[8:15] on your coffee table in your lounge area
[8:17] let God make it a living reality we have
[8:23] this written record of God's Word so
[8:25] that we can know that it is possible for
[8:29] you and I to have a personal intimate
[8:34] close relationship with Jesus Christ
[8:38] there there doesn't have to be a
[8:41] middleman in our relationship with him I
[8:44] don't know about you but I'm thankful
[8:47] for leaders I'm thankful for pastors in
[8:50] fact I believe in the fivefold ministry
[8:54] that we read about in the book of
[8:56] Ephesians I believe that there must be
[9:00] even today men of God who function in
[9:04] the office of apostle prophet pastor
[9:07] teacher and evangelist and how blessed
[9:10] we are to sit under these anointed
[9:13] ministries functioning in their
[9:16] individual God assigned offices and
[9:20] blessing us in different levels and
[9:23] different dimensions for instance those
[9:26] who have the gift of teaching I need to
[9:29] be taught those who have the calling or
[9:33] office of a pastor to to bring the Sheep
[9:36] into Shepherd and disciple them we need
[9:39] pastors we need those fiery evangelists
[9:43] who can travel the the hills and dales
[9:47] the highways and byways
[9:50] presenting the good news of the gospel
[9:52] of Jesus Christ I've been following the
[9:55] Lord most of my life and yet I still
[9:58] enjoyed the ministry of an evangelist
[10:02] sometimes I hear a word of the Lord
[10:04] presented in an in a in an evangelistic
[10:07] style I want to be born again all over
[10:10] again I want to accept the Lord into my
[10:13] life all over again so we need that and
[10:15] we need the prophetic element we need
[10:18] the the prophetic office of the fivefold
[10:21] ministry to take the Word of God and
[10:23] help us to discern the present times and
[10:28] seasons of the Lord did you know that
[10:32] that there are herbs and flows there are
[10:37] times and seasons in the things of God
[10:41] there are certain seasons and moments in
[10:45] fact I'm thinking now of the two Greek
[10:48] words that are used in the New Testament
[10:50] for time one is Chronos time and that is
[10:55] kept by the calendar by the watch it's
[10:59] the natural sense of time and then
[11:02] Kairos time that is it's different than
[11:07] natural time you can't tell Kai hero's
[11:11] time on the calendar not even the Hebrew
[11:15] calendar maybe that's a closer way of
[11:18] beginning to discern those things but
[11:20] but it's spiritual times and seasons in
[11:25] other words there are different moments
[11:28] in our life where there are heightened
[11:31] seasons of spiritual activity where God
[11:35] desires to focus on a particular truth
[11:40] every thing recorded in God's Word is
[11:44] true it is yay and a man heaven and
[11:48] earth will pass away but not one shot
[11:51] not one tittle not one vowel mark of the
[11:55] scripture will ever pass away until all
[11:59] things are fulfilled this is the
[12:02] confidence we can have
[12:03] in God's Word but there are those
[12:06] moments when God emphasizes certain
[12:10] truths for certain periods of time or
[12:14] seasons in your life those of you who
[12:18] have been part of a local congregation
[12:19] or church there are themes and you can
[12:23] pick them up in the spirit I don't just
[12:26] mean the pastor preaching on a series
[12:28] but if he's spirit led that's exactly
[12:32] many times how God introduces us to
[12:35] those Kairos moments with him is by an
[12:39] emphasis in the preaching of our leaders
[12:43] of our pastor what is God saying the day
[12:47] what is he focusing on right now what
[12:50] would be of the most benefit in my life
[12:53] and the life of my family these are
[12:56] things that we sometimes have to be
[12:58] sensitive to so that we can discover
[13:00] God's heart for us as his children right
[13:05] now and then we need the Apostolic we
[13:09] need the administrative gift of being
[13:12] able to put things in order because this
[13:15] is a chaotic world and even the business
[13:19] of the kingdom of God and don't be
[13:21] offended when I say business I'm not
[13:23] talking about in in in a sense of
[13:25] monetary business I'm talking about the
[13:29] work of the kingdom what must we do that
[13:32] we might work the works of God today how
[13:37] God desires for us to do the work of the
[13:39] kingdom in 2018 it's going to be
[13:43] different than it was in the time of the
[13:46] earthly ministry of our Lord in Galilee
[13:49] the approach is going to be different
[13:51] and the tools that we have to use are
[13:54] going to be different but of course the
[13:56] truth of the kingdom is ageless it's
[14:00] exactly the same truth today the kingdom
[14:03] of God is within the hearts of men so we
[14:07] need the fivefold ministry we definitely
[14:10] do but I want you to remember that God
[14:13] wants to meet with you
[14:15] he wants to reveal himself his love for
[14:21] you to you as an individual and I'm
[14:25] telling you when you begin to realize
[14:27] that there is a living God on the other
[14:30] end of your prayer it makes a huge
[14:34] difference in how you feel and how you
[14:37] walk before him we're not just praying
[14:41] to a God who has no ability to hear an
[14:44] answer or a God who cannot speak we're
[14:48] praying to a living God who hears who
[14:52] cares and who understands no matter what
[14:55] you're going through right now watching
[14:58] this broke program I want you to know
[15:01] that there is a God
[15:04] who knows exactly how you feel you may
[15:08] feel extremely alone you may feel like
[15:12] there's no one on this planet that you
[15:14] can really pour your heart out to and
[15:17] tell how you feel well I have good news
[15:20] for you the Lord Jesus Christ stands as
[15:23] as intercessor as high priest he desires
[15:28] for us to unburden ourselves on him
[15:32] where did you get such an idea like that
[15:35] brother Shelly from God's Word
[15:38] he said casting all of your cares on me
[15:43] for I care for you I don't know about
[15:46] you but that gives me a tremendous sense
[15:49] of peace today to know that the Lord
[15:52] Jesus Christ Yeshua my Messiah cares
[15:56] about me and he knows he already knows
[16:00] when I'm having a bad Monday or a
[16:03] difficult Wednesday he knows all about
[16:06] it
[16:07] but he desires that I would come to him
[16:10] and share it's the kind of relationship
[16:13] that is so powerful when a husband and a
[16:18] wife can come together in that kind of
[16:20] relationship it's how God intended it to
[16:23] be that we could tell our companion our
[16:26] spouse exactly how we feel
[16:28] with
[16:29] fear of being condemned judged or
[16:31] misunderstood let me tell you that there
[16:35] are many marriages on the planet that
[16:37] have not yet even after many years
[16:39] developed that kind of openness and
[16:42] that's a shame because I believe that
[16:45] the Lord Jesus Christ desires to bring
[16:48] healing and strength into marriages so
[16:52] that you can experience that safety
[16:55] there there's no feeling like the safety
[16:58] of a real God ordained relationship
[17:04] especially when it's in the confines of
[17:06] marriage he wants us to look to him in a
[17:11] very similar manner the Bible tells us
[17:14] he is not only our Savior our Lord our
[17:18] elder brother are soon coming King but
[17:23] to a remnant of people that God is
[17:25] calling to the deeper truths of his word
[17:29] he has also revealed himself as our
[17:33] bridegroom if Jesus Yeshua is our
[17:38] bridegroom then what does that make us
[17:41] it makes us a part of his bride we can
[17:47] gain so much strength and so much truth
[17:51] by taking the time to lean on our
[17:55] beloved we do that by learning of him
[18:00] and we learn of him through his word let
[18:05] me invite you to the scripture today
[18:07] hebrews chapter 4 verse 11 and 12 well
[18:12] I've already read verse 12 probably more
[18:15] than once in these broadcasts that we've
[18:19] been doing in partnership with the
[18:21] gospel channel but I like it so much I
[18:24] think I'm going to read it again but to
[18:27] mix it up a little bit we'll start in
[18:29] verse 11 it says let us labor therefore
[18:34] to enter into
[18:37] at rest lest any man fall after the same
[18:42] example of unbelief for the Word of God
[18:47] is quick and powerful and sharper than
[18:53] any two-edged sword piercing even to the
[18:58] dividing asunder of soul and spirit and
[19:03] of the joints and marrow and is a
[19:07] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[19:11] the heart the Word of God again this is
[19:18] the written record of his word but when
[19:20] we approach it in the spirit it becomes
[19:24] the revelation of his Living Word and so
[19:28] the Living Word of God as introduced by
[19:31] the written word of God is quite a
[19:34] powerful tool you might even say a
[19:37] weapon in fact it can get into the
[19:41] inside of the inside of the inside of
[19:44] what makes us tick of who we really are
[19:47] in fact I know of nothing else that can
[19:51] get into that fine line of the inner man
[19:55] between the soul and the spirit that's a
[19:59] very important place for the Word of God
[20:02] to be effective because we want to know
[20:05] what is this leadership I'm making
[20:08] decisions but am I making decisions from
[20:12] his Spirit that now reigns in and over
[20:18] my human spirit or am i doing this with
[20:22] another dimension of Who I am my soul
[20:24] our soul is made up of our mind our
[20:29] capacity to think our intellect our will
[20:32] which God has given to us as a gift and
[20:35] our emotions and remember emotions are
[20:40] not our enemy we just have to be able to
[20:42] control our thoughts and our emotion and
[20:46] to bring them into subjection
[20:50] to the truth of God's Word about our
[20:53] lives as individuals so this word of God
[20:57] it's a powerful force when it is alive
[21:02] to us and in us then it can even become
[21:07] alive through us and that's where
[21:10] ministry comes in particularly the
[21:13] ministry of reconciliation the Apostle
[21:18] says here that the Word of God has two
[21:21] edges it's sharp on both edges of the
[21:25] blade
[21:26] I remember the old-timers and the
[21:29] Pentecostal church that I grew up in
[21:31] they would say about the Word of God
[21:33] it's two-edged they would say it cuts
[21:36] going in and it cuts coming out I want
[21:40] you to know that's not a bad thing it
[21:43] kind of sounds a little scary
[21:45] this word of God cutting on the way in
[21:48] and cutting on the way out but friend if
[21:51] you're where I am in my life then I know
[21:54] your desire is the same as mine and that
[21:57] is I desire that God showed me by his
[22:02] word the very thing in my life that is
[22:05] not like him so that it can be extracted
[22:09] the Word of God is sharper than a
[22:12] surgeon's scalpel he has the ability by
[22:16] the Holy Spirit to come right into the
[22:19] inside as we said a moment ago of the
[22:22] insight helping us to determine is this
[22:25] the Holy Spirit leading me am i making
[22:28] decisions by the spirit or am i making
[22:32] decisions by my soul by my own opinion
[22:36] by my own mind my own self-will and my
[22:40] own unrestrained emotions sometimes we
[22:44] can look to counselors to give us the
[22:47] answer we can seek the advice of friends
[22:50] but they can only do so much they can
[22:54] only give us their opinion perhaps it's
[22:57] an educated opinion but it's still just
[22:59] an opinion but there
[23:02] is something that can give us more than
[23:06] an opinion someone said well isn't God's
[23:09] Word God's opinion well yes I guess we
[23:12] could say on a base level that the
[23:15] opinion of God is revealed in his word
[23:17] but listen this is more than the opinion
[23:21] of God this is God on a written page how
[23:26] do we know that because the Bible tells
[23:28] us so this is the Avenue it is the
[23:34] vehicle that leads us to that
[23:37] relationship that we were talking about
[23:39] a moment ago with the Living Word
[23:42] let me read verse 11 to you again in the
[23:45] amplified version of the Bible it says
[23:48] let us therefore be zealous I want you
[23:52] to know zealous is to have zeal to have
[23:56] passion it's not to be passive our
[24:01] relationship with both the written
[24:03] record of God's Word and most
[24:06] importantly the Living Word the life of
[24:09] Jesus Christ inside of us it cannot be a
[24:12] passive relationship it has to be an
[24:16] active passionate life relationship it
[24:22] has to be something that we actively
[24:24] pursue and according to the Apostles
[24:28] speaking to the Hebrew believers we've
[24:31] got to be zealous let us therefore be
[24:34] zealous and exert ourselves now that
[24:39] speaks about some physical determination
[24:43] it speaks about as King James translates
[24:47] it work labor and strive diligently to
[24:53] enter that rest the rest of God to know
[24:59] and experience it for ourselves this is
[25:05] so precious to me that my god your God
[25:10] desires to invite you
[25:14] to enter into a place of rest a place
[25:19] where we have full dependence on him and
[25:23] full confidence that whatever we commit
[25:27] into his hands he's not going to fumble
[25:30] and he's not going to lose he's going to
[25:33] hold on to it and he's going to work in
[25:37] it always for our good what God is doing
[25:43] in our in our life what you sense God
[25:46] doing in your life right now it may not
[25:48] always feel good especially the things
[25:52] that sometimes God allows and in
[25:57] themselves those things may not be good
[25:59] but the scripture promises they are
[26:03] given or allowed for our good there is a
[26:08] work going on in the bride of Jesus
[26:11] Christ the sons of God around the world
[26:15] right now that is unprecedented because
[26:18] of its of its scope its vast I believe
[26:25] God is making up his remnant bride in in
[26:28] all the nations of the earth and though
[26:31] we are not connected together by some
[26:34] denominational hierarchy or some great
[26:38] organization maybe even we're not
[26:40] connected by some amazing app we are
[26:45] connected by the same Holy Spirit and
[26:48] what I so love about my journeys around
[26:52] the world in over 65 countries I love
[26:57] the fact that what I have often found
[26:59] when I travel is the same truths that
[27:02] God is emphasizing in one place he's
[27:05] often emphasizing them in another place
[27:08] maybe not always in the mainstream
[27:10] church but somewhere in that place we
[27:14] find a group of people that God has been
[27:17] dealing with in a very similar way
[27:19] bless the Lord that's the work of God
[27:23] that's the work of the king
[27:25] of God and he is doing it sovereignly by
[27:30] his spirit in multiple places at one
[27:34] time only God could pull that off
[27:37] without some sort of structure to pull
[27:41] us all together to make sure we all
[27:43] believe the same thing I want you to
[27:46] know man has tried to organize God man
[27:50] has tried to organize the church we've
[27:54] gone way beyond the simple structure
[27:57] that's outlined in the scripture for the
[28:00] function of the church the Bible gives
[28:04] us some beautiful examples I spoke about
[28:07] one a moment ago the fivefold ministry
[28:09] that's a part of God's order for his New
[28:13] Testament church we read about deacons
[28:16] bishops leaders we read about church
[28:20] order and sometimes even a little bit of
[28:23] discipline if there's a member of the
[28:26] church community that is openly in sin
[28:29] and leading others astray
[28:31] there are simple guidelines in the New
[28:34] Testament for how the true Church of
[28:36] Jesus Christ should operate but have you
[28:38] ever considered how far man has gone way
[28:44] beyond the boundaries and perimeters of
[28:47] Scripture to try to improve I guess in
[28:51] some ways the church is like any other
[28:54] company it seems that they're always
[28:57] trying to come out with a new and
[28:59] improved version you know what I believe
[29:03] I believe that if we as the Church of
[29:05] Jesus Christ could just get back to the
[29:08] simplicity of the scripture and to the
[29:11] simple structure of the book of Acts
[29:15] oftentimes we have Matthew Mark Luke
[29:18] John the four Gospels followed by the
[29:21] book of Acts and oftentimes they call
[29:25] that book the Acts of the Apostles well
[29:28] I want you to know that the Apostles
[29:30] were great men of God but they would
[29:33] have been
[29:34] empty men they would have been helpless
[29:37] men without the power of the life of
[29:42] Jesus Christ that was now living inside
[29:45] of them because of what happened on the
[29:48] day of Pentecost and so therefore we
[29:51] could say that the book of Acts that
[29:55] follows the four Gospels is not indeed
[29:58] the Acts of the Apostles but rather the
[30:01] acts of the Holy Spirit through the
[30:03] Apostles and I believe if we could just
[30:07] bring the church back to how things were
[30:09] done then I mean not III want you to
[30:13] understand that I don't mean that we
[30:15] should ignore the tools that we have
[30:17] today or that we should ignore the fact
[30:20] that we're living 2,000 years after many
[30:23] things have been wonderfully updated for
[30:27] us we have streaming of our services or
[30:31] so that we can reach more than our local
[30:34] congregation we have YouTube by the way
[30:39] you can find new hope revival ministries
[30:42] on YouTube and you can go back and watch
[30:45] any of these programs that you've missed
[30:47] and a lot of other videos of songs and
[30:53] teaching and interviews and things that
[30:55] I know would be a blessing to you so
[30:57] look for us on youtube and also
[31:00] subscribe and know that wasn't a
[31:03] commercial because I'm not selling
[31:05] anything but I just felt comfortable to
[31:07] mention it to you thank God we have all
[31:10] these tools I've even seen God work
[31:13] through something as silly as social
[31:17] media Facebook Instagram Twitter God can
[31:22] use these things so I'm not saying that
[31:25] we should go back and and and forget all
[31:28] those modern things that it can be a
[31:30] blessing to the kingdom of God and just
[31:32] live exactly like it was in the book of
[31:34] Acts that's not what I mean but what I
[31:36] mean is we should uncomplicated
[31:40] really we should we get in fact I I was
[31:44] telling our congregation last night that
[31:47] I'm
[31:47] being bombarded with all of these emails
[31:51] because I'm on a an email list of
[31:54] pastors and so you know for for 1499
[31:58] there they want to sell me the most
[32:01] wonderful sermon outlines for Easter
[32:04] that I've ever read before so that we
[32:07] can have the best Easter Sunday service
[32:09] at our church than we've ever had and it
[32:11] goes on and on and on one one email
[32:13] wanted to send a subscription wanted me
[32:16] to subscribe to learning how to get
[32:19] people to give their biggest offering on
[32:21] Easter Sunday and I want you to know
[32:24] that's way out of my league I'm so not
[32:29] interested in any of that furthermore
[32:34] Jesus is not about Easter Sunday the
[32:38] resurrection is not a day the
[32:41] resurrection is a person we should shift
[32:45] our focus from some of these things that
[32:47] are what I call trappings of
[32:49] Christianity they have nothing to do
[32:52] with the simplicity of God's Word we
[32:54] ought to go back to the simplicity of
[32:56] the scripture and the church structure
[32:59] is outlined in the Bible and my I
[33:01] believe we could see some things take
[33:03] place if instead of making more programs
[33:06] we actually uncomplicated things a bit
[33:10] and just prayed sought the face of God
[33:14] with fasting and sincerity and waited on
[33:17] the wind of God to blow through our
[33:20] little church community I tell you that
[33:22] would transform us in a whole maybe
[33:26] faster if not faster than I guarantee
[33:30] you in a more biblical way than some of
[33:33] the approaches of the church today I
[33:35] didn't mean to get off on that
[33:37] in fact sometimes we call those bunny
[33:39] trails but it is the truth we want to
[33:42] see God do in our lives what he was
[33:45] doing through the apostles and we ought
[33:48] to consider some of the truths outlined
[33:51] in the scripture that get overlooked for
[33:55] instance maybe we should go to acts 2:38
[33:57] and find out the Apostolic for
[34:01] for baptism and if God honored it in
[34:05] acts 2:38 and honored it in that in the
[34:09] whole entirety of the book the book of
[34:12] Acts the acts of the Holy Spirit we saw
[34:15] God adding to the church daily we saw
[34:17] God filling people with the Holy Ghost
[34:19] not by the dozens by the thousands so
[34:23] maybe if we examined our foundation a
[34:25] little bit in the way we're doing things
[34:27] today uncomplicated distressed some
[34:30] things maybe we could see the power of
[34:33] God operating among us as we have read
[34:36] about in God's Word okay enough of that
[34:40] we'll move on what I wanted to share
[34:43] about this
[34:44] Hebrews 411 is this is this sense of
[34:48] being zealous exerting ourselves
[34:52] striving diligently to enter that place
[34:55] of rest he said here the rest of God to
[35:00] know and experience it for ourselves
[35:01] that no man may fall or perish by the
[35:06] same kind of unbelief and disobedience
[35:09] into which those in the wilderness fell
[35:13] and he goes on for the word of god
[35:17] speaks is alive for the word that god
[35:21] speaks is alive and full of power making
[35:24] it active operative energizing and
[35:27] effective this is the verse i bread to
[35:30] you several times it is sharper than any
[35:34] two-edged sword penetrating to the
[35:37] dividing line of the breath of life soul
[35:40] and the immortal spirit and of joints
[35:43] and marrow of the deepest parts of our
[35:46] nature exposing and sifting and
[35:50] analyzing and judging the very thoughts
[35:53] and purposes of the heart again the
[35:55] amplified bible tremendously amplifies
[35:59] makes very clear the the power of god's
[36:04] word but that verse 11 is what i want to
[36:08] talk about it presents to us a paradox
[36:14] because most of us know that rest in its
[36:18] general definition is to do nothing I
[36:20] mean that's what we think of when we
[36:23] think of rest and yet the Bible says
[36:27] again it's a paradox we should therefore
[36:30] labor work exert ourselves be zealous to
[36:37] enter into that rest again what a
[36:42] paradox let's work to rest if you want
[36:46] to get into rest you've got to work I
[36:48] know and you do too that if there's such
[36:51] a paradox presented for us in God's
[36:54] words there's a reason for it there's a
[36:58] truth that we need to grab ahold of
[37:02] really it is connected to what I was
[37:04] sharing a moment ago about simplifying
[37:07] the way we do things because the
[37:10] striving the labor the effort the
[37:14] exertion that the Apostle is talking
[37:17] about here is not just doing works for
[37:21] the sake of doing works it's not just
[37:25] being busy about the kingdom of God so
[37:27] that we can look busy or be busy wear
[37:30] ourselves out or as the expression goes
[37:33] burn our candle on both ends I want you
[37:37] to know their ministers pastors church
[37:40] workers across the world that are in
[37:42] exhaustion many are past what we have
[37:46] come to call the burnout in fact the
[37:51] suicide statistics for pastors is huge
[37:56] all across the world because the stress
[38:00] and the complication of getting it all
[38:03] done is wearing people out I believe
[38:08] there's a truth here for not only
[38:09] leaders I believe there's a truth here
[38:12] for every seeker of God for every person
[38:17] watching this program who desires to be
[38:20] in that place of close and intimate
[38:22] fellowship with Jesus Christ I believe
[38:25] there's a secret for us here
[38:27] this statement in Hebrews 4:11 it sounds
[38:33] contradictory at the very least it's a
[38:37] paradox and we can also see from this
[38:41] verse that whatever this labor is that
[38:43] we have to do it's spoken about here the
[38:48] rider is associating this labor with
[38:52] unbelief I don't know how you feel about
[38:55] unbelief but I believe that by
[38:58] definition unbelief is sin and all of
[39:03] the other things that we often
[39:05] categorize as sin are really the
[39:09] attributes of unbelief if we truly
[39:13] believed that God is a rewarder of those
[39:16] who diligently seek Him then wouldn't we
[39:19] seek his face and so if we're not
[39:23] seeking after God and please understand
[39:25] we can only seek him when he is drawing
[39:28] us the scripture is clear but if we know
[39:32] that that's what we're supposed to do
[39:34] and we say we believe God's Word and
[39:36] we're not doing it isn't there a measure
[39:38] of unbelief it's the same way when we
[39:41] hear the church saying Jesus is coming
[39:43] soon Jesus is coming soon
[39:46] but I wonder how many people really
[39:48] believe we're living in the days of the
[39:51] coming of the Lord for if we truly
[39:53] believe that we're living in the days of
[39:56] the coming of the Lord wouldn't we also
[39:58] live a life that testified of our faith
[40:04] I think we would do things differently
[40:07] if we believe that the coming of the
[40:09] Lord was imminent so what keeps us from
[40:12] doing it it's that element of unbelief
[40:14] so I believe that the Apostle here is
[40:18] connecting the labor that we must do to
[40:21] enter interest with that huge element of
[40:26] unbelief and when we continue to read a
[40:30] lot of this begins to sort of unfold for
[40:33] us I believe the Apostle is saying we
[40:37] must labor so that we do not experience
[40:41] this unbelief we must labor so that we
[40:45] do not fall into unbelief as our fathers
[40:50] did and the fathers that are being
[40:51] spoken about here were the children of
[40:54] Israel in the wilderness there's a
[40:58] interesting version of the Bible the
[41:00] complete Jewish Bible by dr. David Stern
[41:03] and I like to look at it I like to read
[41:07] it I like to use it in study and he
[41:10] translates a portion of verse 11 this
[41:12] way so that no one will fall short
[41:17] because of the same kind of disobedience
[41:22] God is inspiring the Apostle to write
[41:27] this letter to the Hebrew believers
[41:31] reminding them of their forefathers in
[41:34] the wilderness who were not able to
[41:37] enter into the rest now in their
[41:41] father's case the rest was the promised
[41:44] land
[41:45] it was Canaan and the problem with
[41:49] Canaan was there were inhabitants in the
[41:52] land and there was going to be a whole
[41:56] process involved in displacing the
[42:00] inhabitants of the land so that indeed
[42:03] the children of Israel could take full
[42:05] possession of what God was giving to
[42:09] them now remember there was no stealing
[42:11] going on here they were given that land
[42:15] by Almighty God the Creator but the
[42:19] thing is he didn't just hand it over to
[42:21] them in a basket and say here it is it's
[42:24] easy it's yours in fact there was labor
[42:29] involved and the Bible is telling us
[42:33] here in Hebrews and we'll read it in
[42:36] just a moment that many of our fathers
[42:40] were not able to enter into the Promised
[42:44] Land the place of rest and it all boiled
[42:48] down to one thing unbelief so Paul is
[42:54] right
[42:54] if indeed Paul is the author of this
[42:57] book and I believe he is then he is
[42:59] writing to the Hebrew believers we must
[43:02] not make the same mistake as dr. David
[43:06] Stern says in the complete Jewish Bible
[43:08] here so that no one will fall short
[43:11] because of the same kind of disobedience
[43:15] did you know that unbelief is
[43:19] disobedience when we fail to take God at
[43:23] His Word we're walking in unbelief and
[43:27] therefore this unbelief manifests itself
[43:31] in our lives as disobedience
[43:35] we cannot obey a word that we do not
[43:39] fully believe it's nearly impossible and
[43:43] then I also want you to notice as we
[43:46] study this that entrance is emphasized
[43:51] in this verse of scripture the way we
[43:54] get in the entrance to a home is usually
[43:59] by the door if you lock yourself out
[44:02] sometimes it's by the window but there
[44:06] are ways to get in and hopefully there
[44:10] are ways to get out especially in in an
[44:15] emergency situation and you know that in
[44:18] a commercial building or public building
[44:21] we have to make sure that the entrances
[44:23] are never blocked that there is an easy
[44:27] way to come in and an even easier way to
[44:30] get out in case of an emergency in fact
[44:34] in our church here in Alabama we have
[44:36] one door that is just not my favorite
[44:39] door I don't like the way it has to
[44:42] swing but the fire marshal has
[44:45] determined that it has to swing a
[44:48] certain way because it is adjacent to an
[44:53] to a door that leads outside of the
[44:56] building it's so close this door out of
[45:00] the sanctuary into the back hall is so
[45:03] close to an exit that it has to swing
[45:07] away from
[45:08] the exit door so that people can can
[45:11] easily get right out through the door
[45:14] that goes outside and when I'm trying to
[45:18] go back down the hall that door swings
[45:20] the wrong way and literally you have to
[45:23] step out of the way of the door to be
[45:25] able to go down the hall but I
[45:27] understand the principle and the
[45:30] importance of being able to get out so
[45:32] here in verse eleven we not only hear
[45:36] unbelief emphasized as being one of the
[45:39] reasons why they couldn't go in but we
[45:42] hear the entrance the way to get in
[45:47] being emphasized and the Apostle is
[45:50] clear he says the way to get in is to
[45:53] labor now I'm going to have to study to
[45:58] figure out what this labor is about what
[46:02] kind of work is involved that will get
[46:05] me over there to rest because I'm tired
[46:08] we might say I'm looking for the
[46:11] promised land and in this situation
[46:14] we're not talking about heaven the end
[46:17] of our life or thank God we have a
[46:19] promised land thank God we have a Canaan
[46:22] land promised thank God we have an
[46:25] eternity and an eternal home that is
[46:28] prepared for us by our Father who loves
[46:31] us so much but I believe that the
[46:34] Scriptures also talking about a place of
[46:37] trust a place of dependency a place of
[46:41] spiritual rest I don't know about you
[46:44] but I need that I need that greater
[46:48] place of dependency on him it's easy
[46:51] sometime to develop a little confidence
[46:55] in your ability to get it done and you
[46:57] know the Lord will test us in that
[47:00] sometime he'll allow us to walk through
[47:03] some situations where we begin to doubt
[47:06] greatly our ability to get it done and
[47:11] that's not because God wants to strip us
[47:13] down it's because he wants to bring us
[47:17] into a closer relationship
[47:21] and a greater dependency on him he must
[47:25] be our source his life is my source for
[47:32] living I'm not just existing by the
[47:36] natural breath that comes in and out of
[47:39] my lungs but as a believer filled with
[47:44] the Holy Ghost his life becomes my
[47:48] source for living and so the Apostle is
[47:53] trying to instruct us by using the past
[47:57] as an example and using something that
[48:00] we're all familiar with labor work to
[48:04] find a place of entrance into a
[48:09] spiritual rest now one day that
[48:12] spiritual rest will take us to a place
[48:16] of eternal rest I certainly believe that
[48:18] with all my heart in the time that we
[48:22] have left today I want us to just
[48:25] quickly look at what I believe is a
[48:28] further explanation and understanding of
[48:31] the verses that we just read in Hebrews
[48:33] 4 and in order to do that we'll go back
[48:36] a chapter let's look at Hebrews chapter
[48:38] 3 and the next time we're together we'll
[48:42] go a little bit further into this study
[48:44] but in Hebrews chapter 3 verses 8
[48:48] through 14 and I encourage you to read
[48:51] in your own time all of Hebrews chapter
[48:54] 3 and all of Hebrews chapter 4 because a
[48:58] parallel is being drawn between the
[49:03] journeying of the children of Israel
[49:06] into the Promised Land through the
[49:09] wilderness and also to the life of a
[49:13] spirit-filled New Testament believer a
[49:16] parallel is being drawn in the entirety
[49:19] of those two chapters verse 8 harden not
[49:23] your heart your hearts as in the
[49:28] provocation in the day of temptation in
[49:32] the wilderness again the Apostle
[49:35] King us back to our fathers journeying
[49:38] in the wilderness verse nine when your
[49:41] father's tempted to me proved me and saw
[49:45] my works 40 years let's not forget that
[49:49] the children of Israel were
[49:51] supernaturally fed and supernaturally
[49:54] led for 40 long years and yet they
[49:59] tempted God in the wilderness with their
[50:04] unbelief in fact the complete Jewish
[50:07] Bible that we mentioned a moment ago
[50:09] instead of using the word in the day of
[50:12] provocation it talks about the bitter
[50:15] quarrel it says that your father's
[50:20] tempted me in the bitter quarrel verse
[50:24] 10 wherefore I was grieved with that
[50:28] generation this is not something we want
[50:30] to hear that God would be grieved with
[50:34] us we want to bring him joy we want to
[50:37] bless him bless his name
[50:39] bless his kingdom with our with our
[50:42] lives by serving him and loving him
[50:44] worshiping him we don't want to be
[50:47] guilty of grieving the Lord but that
[50:50] generation they grieved the Lord and
[50:54] they where for I was grieved with that
[50:57] generation and said they do always err
[51:00] in their heart and have not known my
[51:04] ways you see the Apostle is speaking in
[51:08] the way that God was speaking to the
[51:11] children of Israel he saw beyond their
[51:15] behavior he saw beyond their actions God
[51:20] was seeing their heart that's another
[51:23] thing that the Word of God has power and
[51:25] anointing to do is to discern the intent
[51:29] the motive of what we call our heart not
[51:33] the blood pump but that internal part of
[51:36] who we are and God was looking at their
[51:40] heart and he said they have not known my
[51:43] ways even though the instruction the
[51:47] Torah the law of God
[51:48] was given to them God said they didn't
[51:50] know my ways they may have been able to
[51:53] recite some of my laws they may have
[51:57] even been able to obey some of my loss
[52:00] but they have not known my ways verse 11
[52:03] so I swear in my wrath they shall not
[52:06] enter into my rest I'm telling you this
[52:09] is serious business God just said
[52:12] because you didn't know my ways I'm not
[52:16] going to allow you to enter into this
[52:19] rest your mind you're my children
[52:22] you're my chosen I have fed you I have
[52:25] led you
[52:26] I provided manna when you needed bread I
[52:29] provided quail when you needed me I
[52:32] opened up the way through the Red Sea
[52:34] I turned the bitter water sweet
[52:38] I sent the pillar of fire to lead you
[52:41] and to also keep you warm in the night
[52:44] and I sent the pillar of cloud to lead
[52:46] you and to keep you in shade in the
[52:50] daytime protecting you from the desert
[52:53] heat but I'm not gonna let you enter
[52:55] into my rest even though you're mine
[52:58] even though I've done all those things
[53:00] for you I'm not going to let you enter
[53:03] into my rest verse 12 take heed brethren
[53:06] lest there be in any of you an evil
[53:10] heart of unbelief in departing from the
[53:13] Living God so here Paul is saying we've
[53:15] got to look at the example of our
[53:17] forefathers and whatever we do children
[53:20] we must not follow their example in this
[53:23] manner verse 13 he said but exhort one
[53:27] another daily while it is called today
[53:30] lest any of you be hardened through the
[53:34] deceitfulness of sin for we are made
[53:37] here's the verse I've used with you
[53:38] before for we are made partakers of
[53:42] Christ if we hold the beginning of our
[53:47] confidence steadfast unto the end
[53:51] so we're blessed of God to have this
[53:55] example of how you can be the chosen of
[53:59] God and God working for you
[54:02] providing for you leading you and yet he
[54:06] said to our fathers in the wilderness
[54:08] but you can't go into the promised land
[54:10] what happened they had to die in the
[54:13] wilderness and another generation arose
[54:16] after them that were willing and able to
[54:21] take God at His Word
[54:23] they found the key they found that place
[54:27] that was necessary for entrance into the
[54:32] rest that had been promised to them and
[54:36] this is what we're going to look at when
[54:39] we're together again we're going to look
[54:41] at what can we do as individuals to find
[54:46] entrance to labor to go in to that
[54:51] promised place of rest I can't tell you
[54:55] enough how much I appreciate your
[54:56] attention today and that you would take
[54:59] your time to study God's Word with me I
[55:02] love this word and I believe the more we
[55:05] love the word the more we will love the
[55:07] Living Word Jesus Christ and the more we
[55:10] will experience his love through his
[55:12] word if you've ever doubted God's love
[55:15] for you dig a little deeper in the
[55:18] storehouse of God's Word and you will
[55:21] discover the great love wherewith our
[55:25] Father has loved us lord I ask you right
[55:30] now in the precious name of the Lord
[55:34] Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah that you
