Description:
It is most important that we guard our thoughts, watch our words, and watch what we come in agreement with. We must ask the Holy Spirit to so reshape our vocabulary, that we come into complete alignment with God’s Word.  God doesn’t call our negative expressions ‘disappointment’ or ‘backslidings.’  He calls it “Evil”.  He wants to give us complete deliverance.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
it's not only possible that God is going to give us total Deliverance it is upon us it's the hour to claim it [Music] when when we are not in agreement with what God has promised and when we speak something from our being that is not in agreement with what God's word has said God doesn't say that's being negative oh that's what we say to one another don't be so negative but that's not what God calls it at all he calls it evil did you know the Book of Genesis helps us to understand when we are not bringing forth what we have been called to bring forth all that a disappointment when we are not manifesting what God has called us to manifest the Hebrew language calls it evil and when God said you can overcome all things and we start making excuses for why people have not yet overcome When God says I want to give you total deliverance and we start explaining why you may not have total Deliverance God doesn't call that being negative foreign yeah I want to tell it today because that being evil so it's possible that even churches are giving evil reports not not just negative reports but evil reports when we are calling the shot only by what we can see with the natural eye in spite of what God has already said he wanted to do God doesn't call that negative [Music] he calls it evil so I want you and I to watch our words to watch our thoughts and we need to watch our words and we need to watch what we come into agreement with we need to ask the Holy Spirit to reform and reshape our vocabulary so that when we open our mouth we are speaking the things that come into alignment with what God has said it's not only possible it's imminent it's not only possible that God is going to give us total Deliverance it is upon us and this is the hour to claim it the Holy Ghost baptism is real the genuine New Birth is real the supernatural God is real I encourage you not to worry about what others would say but go after it with everything you've got Party by speaking tongue Soviet what if I mess up my hair so then what if I slobber and snot so be it what if I lose my place in the church so be it what if my own family won't talk to me so damn there comes a time when we must make the decision to take God at his word and refuse to live in the Borderland go after it with everything you've got [Music]
