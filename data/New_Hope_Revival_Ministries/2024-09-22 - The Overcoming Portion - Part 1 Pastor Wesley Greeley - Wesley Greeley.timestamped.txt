[1:08:04] today in Revelation chap 1 starting in
[1:08:08] verse
[1:08:12] 10 Revelation
[1:08:14] 1 verse
[1:08:18] 10 I was in the spirit on the Lord's day
[1:08:23] and heard behind me a great voice as of
[1:08:26] a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega
[1:08:32] the first and the last and what thou
[1:08:36] seest write in a book and send it unto
[1:08:39] the seven churches which are in Asia
[1:08:42] unto Ephesus unto Smyrna unto pergamus
[1:08:45] unto thyra unto Sardis and unto
[1:08:48] Philadelphia and unto
[1:08:51] leoda and I turned to see the voice that
[1:08:55] spoke with me and being turned I saw
[1:08:59] seven golden
[1:09:01] candlesticks and in the midst of the
[1:09:03] seven candlesticks one like unto the son
[1:09:06] of man clothed with a garment down to
[1:09:10] the foot and GT about the pths with a
[1:09:13] golden
[1:09:14] girdle his head and his hairs were white
[1:09:18] like wool as white as snow and his eyes
[1:09:21] were as a flame of fire and his feet
[1:09:24] like undefined brass as if they burned
[1:09:27] in a furnace and his voice as the sound
[1:09:30] of many Waters and he had in his right
[1:09:33] hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth
[1:09:36] went a sharp two-edged sword and his
[1:09:39] countenance was as the sun shineth in
[1:09:43] his
[1:09:44] strength and when I saw him I fell at
[1:09:47] his feet as dead and he laid his right
[1:09:50] hand upon me saying unto me fear not I
[1:09:54] am the first and the last I am he that
[1:09:58] liveth and was dead and behold I am
[1:10:00] alive forever more amen and have the
[1:10:04] keys of hell and of death write the
[1:10:08] things which thou thou Hast seen and the
[1:10:11] things which are and the things which
[1:10:13] shall be
[1:10:14] Hereafter The Mystery of the Seven Stars
[1:10:17] which thou sawest in my right hand and
[1:10:19] the golden
[1:10:20] candlesticks the Seven Stars are the

[1:12:53] body we
[1:12:55] want to be in the season of the Lord
[1:12:58] every time we want to know that we're in
[1:13:01] his season we're in his plan in the
[1:13:04] purpose for
[1:13:06] today not yesterday and not tomorrow we
[1:13:09] want to be in his plan and purpose for
[1:13:12] today we want to walk hand in hand with
[1:13:15] him to know that we're carrying out his
[1:13:18] plan for our lives and that we're not
[1:13:21] getting under somebody else's burden to
[1:13:23] carry their burden and not carry our own
[1:13:26] that the Lord has placed upon us
[1:13:27] obviously we want to help to carry one
[1:13:30] another's burdens that's not what I'm
[1:13:32] saying but we don't want to carry
[1:13:34] someone else's burden illegally we don't
[1:13:37] want to carry their burden for longer
[1:13:39] than we ought to be helping them to
[1:13:41] carry it we need to be focused on what
[1:13:45] the Lord is saying today and so as I
[1:13:48] pondered what should be for today I
[1:13:53] begin to think about the what we as a
[1:13:57] body have heard time and time again
[1:14:00] concerning uh the the church
[1:14:03] ages and we have heard it said over and
[1:14:07] over and over again that in the last age
[1:14:11] that there would be a culmination of all
[1:14:15] of the spirits of evil that had been in
[1:14:18] all of the other Church ages there would
[1:14:21] be a culmination of the evil and that we
[1:14:24] as as people in the end time we would
[1:14:27] have to face those
[1:14:29] things uh and and they there are many
[1:14:32] and we know that the lid of hell has
[1:14:35] been ripped off and the spirits of
[1:14:38] Darkness that have been down Through the
[1:14:40] Ages they're just looking for something
[1:14:43] or someone uh specifically they're
[1:14:46] looking for someone to inhabit they the
[1:14:49] the spirits do not like to be
[1:14:52] disembodied they are looking for a body
[1:14:55] body to dwell in we can go to the
[1:14:57] scripture and see that when those
[1:15:00] Spirits were CA cast out of the demoniac
[1:15:04] uh who was in the graveyard they wanted
[1:15:07] somewhere to go and when Jesus cast them
[1:15:10] out they asked if they could go into the
[1:15:13] swine we know that they were granted
[1:15:16] permission and they went into the swine
[1:15:18] and immediately the swine jumped off the
[1:15:20] cliff and they all
[1:15:22] drowned so where did the spirit go after
[1:15:27] that they were still looking for a body
[1:15:29] to dwell in they were still looking for
[1:15:32] someone to inhabit they wanted somewhere
[1:15:36] to go and so we know that with all of
[1:15:41] these Spirits floating around those
[1:15:43] things that we cannot see but yet they
[1:15:47] try to infiltrate our mind and and on a
[1:15:50] daily basis thoughts split across our
[1:15:54] mind that they're not
[1:15:58] ours yet if we're in a vulnerable place
[1:16:02] we may entertain
[1:16:04] [Applause]
[1:16:07] them we may momentarily give them a
[1:16:11] place to Lodge and and they talk to us
[1:16:16] for a little while and we talk back to
[1:16:19] them and and then in some instances we
[1:16:23] find ourselves immediately saying that's
[1:16:26] not mine get out of here there are other
[1:16:30] times it may last for some minutes and
[1:16:33] there are other times where we entertain
[1:16:36] it for days weeks months and perhaps
[1:16:39] even years but a child of God has got to
[1:16:42] recognize that there are some things
[1:16:45] that fly through our mind but they're
[1:16:47] not ours and we immediately need to take
[1:16:50] control of them and say not today
[1:16:53] sainton it's not mine I don't I'm not
[1:16:56] going to have this and we you know we
[1:16:58] could keep the victory a whole lot
[1:17:00] better if we learn to talk back to the
[1:17:03] [Applause]
[1:17:05] devil we have been told in the scripture
[1:17:08] over and over and over again fear not
[1:17:12] but I think we're intimidated or afraid
[1:17:14] sometimes to talk back to the devil when
[1:17:16] he tries to come with a thought or an
[1:17:19] idea or something of that dark world to
[1:17:22] put in our mind and cause us to
[1:17:25] entertain it and to live it out but
[1:17:27] that's not the call of a holy ghost
[1:17:30] child of God our call is to get rid of
[1:17:33] everything that is unlike Jesus Christ
[1:17:37] and we can't just say Lord take this out
[1:17:39] of me and remain as an empty
[1:17:43] vessel we must be filled and refilled
[1:17:47] and refilled with the holy ghost power
[1:17:51] over and over again because we don't
[1:17:53] want any voids in our life because the
[1:17:57] devil is as a as a roaring lion he is
[1:18:02] looking for someone to inhabit he's
[1:18:04] looking for someone to take control of
[1:18:07] and all he needs is one little door to
[1:18:10] get into and we need to close off all of
[1:18:14] those doors and continually as Believers
[1:18:17] saying Lord refill me refill me any
[1:18:21] place in me when when we repent and we
[1:18:24] ask the Lord to move something out of us
[1:18:26] we immediately want to ask the Lord Fill
[1:18:29] Me Lord with your holy spirit let your
[1:18:32] life come in and inhabit that spot in me
[1:18:35] because I don't want any place in there
[1:18:38] where the enemy can have free reign in
[1:18:41] my
[1:18:42] life but as I am thinking about the
[1:18:45] these these Church ages and all of the
[1:18:48] all of the spirits the dark Spirits the
[1:18:51] evil of every age culminating
[1:18:54] into this age I begin to ask myself what
[1:19:02] am I needing to
[1:19:04] combat all of these
[1:19:07] things there we know because most of us
[1:19:11] have studied these things out we've
[1:19:13] studied the church ages we've gone
[1:19:15] through them in this church uh several
[1:19:18] times over the years and we've referred
[1:19:21] to them over the years concerning the
[1:19:23] Overcomers and and the over there are
[1:19:27] Overcomers of every age every age had
[1:19:30] Overcomers they came
[1:19:32] over they were able to scale the
[1:19:35] mountain all of you know it it kind of
[1:19:38] reminds me of of of uh this mountain of
[1:19:42] garbage over here on 158 and 183 Waste
[1:19:46] Management it it's uh people's garbage
[1:19:49] that has become a
[1:19:52] mountain it's become very large and
[1:19:55] that's what all of the evil spirits all
[1:19:57] of this all all of the things that you
[1:19:59] and I combat they're like a mountain of
[1:20:02] garbage that we've got to over go over
[1:20:05] and we're we're we don't want any of the
[1:20:08] smell we don't want any of that stuff on
[1:20:10] us we God has sent an a an anointing in
[1:20:14] the end time that we could have a flying
[1:20:18] eagle anointing that we could fly above
[1:20:21] all of it that you know we we've got all
[1:20:24] these analogies concerning climbing the
[1:20:26] mountain and we're actually climbing
[1:20:28] Mount Zion not a mountain of garbage all
[1:20:31] right we're climbing Mount Zion and God
[1:20:34] is giving us the grace to climb Mount
[1:20:36] Zion but there is a pile of garbage in
[1:20:39] this world that we have to overcome and
[1:20:41] we want the Flying Eagle anointing to
[1:20:44] get over it and so you start pondering
[1:20:47] Lord how am I going to overcome and so I
[1:20:50] started breaking down each of these
[1:20:53] Church ages and I I broke them down into
[1:20:57] categories and today I want to just I
[1:21:02] think probably time only for one of
[1:21:04] these categories and that is the most
[1:21:08] important part of every one of these
[1:21:11] categories and that is the one who is
[1:21:14] going to live in us to give us the power
[1:21:17] to
[1:21:18] overcome so when you look at chapter two
[1:21:22] of of the book of the Revelation and it
[1:21:24] starts starts out with the Ephesian
[1:21:27] Church age or the Church of Ephesus uh
[1:21:30] every age starts out with these things
[1:21:34] saith
[1:21:37] he so we're going to talk for some time
[1:21:40] today about
[1:21:42] him and we're going to look at each age
[1:21:45] because each age had their own thing to
[1:21:50] overcome we know that all of the demonic
[1:21:53] spirits have age have culminated now
[1:21:56] into this one and so if every one of the
[1:21:59] evil spirits have come into this age
[1:22:02] that because they're just
[1:22:04] multiplying they're multiplying as the
[1:22:07] ages go by they're multiplying yet we
[1:22:11] have been given the power in the end
[1:22:13] time to overcome we're not going to be
[1:22:16] be left
[1:22:18] helpless as humans we feel helpless
[1:22:22] sometimes we feel like
[1:22:26] you
[1:22:28] describe your feeling may be different
[1:22:31] than my
[1:22:33] feeling yet God has given us the ability
[1:22:37] to overcome in the end time and the only
[1:22:41] way that we're going to do it is because
[1:22:45] that he is living in
[1:22:48] us and we want to see all the
[1:22:51] representations of of of him of what he
[1:22:54] is giving us in the end time to combat
[1:22:57] all of these Spirits so when we look at
[1:23:01] Ephesus we are seeing that these things
[1:23:05] saith he that holdeth the Seven Stars in
[1:23:09] his right hand and walks in the midst of
[1:23:13] the seven golden
[1:23:15] candlesticks so he's holding these
[1:23:19] Messengers and there's some things that
[1:23:21] I'm not going to be able to fully talk
[1:23:23] about today but the Seven Stars as we
[1:23:26] read in the previous chapter the Seven
[1:23:29] Stars are the Angels or The Messengers
[1:23:32] of the seven churches that were in Asia
[1:23:36] Minor now remember the mouthpiece may be
[1:23:39] gone but the angel is still
[1:23:47] here so he that has the Seven Stars in
[1:23:51] his right hand and he walks in the midst
[1:23:53] of the seven gold golden candlesticks
[1:23:55] which again the previous chapter tells
[1:23:58] us that the seven golden candlesticks
[1:24:00] are the seven churches and so we have we
[1:24:04] have an understanding that God is still
[1:24:08] he's holding all of these Messengers in
[1:24:12] his hand he's allowing their message to
[1:24:15] get out to us the message that they had
[1:24:18] their message is still getting out to us
[1:24:21] and we the church he the living God is
[1:24:25] still walking among
[1:24:27] us we are not left
[1:24:29] helpless he is still walking Among Us
[1:24:33] he's still walking among those seven
[1:24:36] golden candlesticks he didn't quit at
[1:24:38] six he continued to walk on the seventh
[1:24:42] one now might I add that there is a
[1:24:45] church within a
[1:24:48] church we are blessed to know that there
[1:24:51] is a church within a church and that to
[1:24:55] clarify that we have been C we're in the
[1:25:00] middle of
[1:25:02] leoda we see it all around us we see the
[1:25:05] spirit of the age it's all around us yet
[1:25:09] there is a part of an overcoming portion
[1:25:12] that has been given to us so that we can
[1:25:16] step out of the influence of the church
[1:25:21] age into a bridal par
[1:25:27] Paradigm now if that's the case in the
[1:25:30] seventh Church
[1:25:31] age it was also the case in every Church
[1:25:35] age because there is a bridal company
[1:25:38] from every Church
[1:25:40] age
[1:25:43] who I mean the scripture tells us that
[1:25:45] there were Overcomers to him that
[1:25:47] overcomes so there was a a there was a
[1:25:49] church within a church there were
[1:25:50] Overcomers there were those that just
[1:25:53] kind of floated along
[1:25:56] they were just kind of part of
[1:25:58] society they acted and looked just like
[1:26:02] the rest of the church world but there
[1:26:04] was a group that
[1:26:07] said I cannot be partakers of what my
[1:26:12] church age is doing I have to step into
[1:26:15] a higher calling so he's not only
[1:26:19] holding the messenger of each age he is
[1:26:22] also Holding On To You John chapter 10
[1:26:25] veres
[1:26:27] 27-30 my sheep hear my voice and I know
[1:26:31] them and they follow me and I give unto
[1:26:35] them eternal life and they shall never
[1:26:38] perish neither shall any man pluck them
[1:26:41] out of my hand my uh my Father which
[1:26:45] gave them me is greater than all and no
[1:26:49] man is able to pluck them out of the
[1:26:52] father's my father's hand
[1:26:55] I and my father are
[1:27:00] one you can't be plucked out of his
[1:27:11] hand you ever had anybody to snatch
[1:27:14] something out of your
[1:27:18] hand know
[1:27:21] if my mind immediately goes to some kind
[1:27:24] of ball
[1:27:25] playing football or basketball or
[1:27:29] something of that nature somebody tries
[1:27:30] to grab it out of your hand knock it out
[1:27:33] of your
[1:27:35] hand
[1:27:37] but you can't be knocked out of Papa's
[1:27:40] hand there is such a strong grip on you
[1:27:44] that you cannot be plucked out of his
[1:27:47] hand if you belong to him you cannot be
[1:27:50] plucked out of his hand that's just who
[1:27:53] he is that's our Focus today be we're
[1:27:56] we're looking at who he is to help us in
[1:28:00] this overcoming process and we're trying
[1:28:03] to see all uh in the this church age
[1:28:07] analogies we're trying to look at who he
[1:28:10] is on our behalf and how we can enter
[1:28:13] into what he has done on our behalf what
[1:28:17] he is doing we want to take part in that
[1:28:19] all right so then we look at the second
[1:28:22] age and that is Mna and the scripture
[1:28:27] says that he is the first and the
[1:28:31] last he which was dead and is alive all
[1:28:35] right so the first and the
[1:28:41] last he is the one who was before any of
[1:28:47] us he started
[1:28:49] it he's the same one that's going to
[1:28:52] finish it right he that has begun the
[1:28:55] good work in you is able to complete it
[1:29:00] bring it all the way to its finish he's
[1:29:02] able to do that for
[1:29:05] you there are times when we fall
[1:29:12] down and his grace reaches down to us
[1:29:16] and picks us back
[1:29:18] up his grace picks us back up because he
[1:29:23] started it and he's going to finish it
[1:29:27] the the scripture said he was the one
[1:29:28] that was dead and is now
[1:29:31] alive in these scriptures we're trying
[1:29:34] to get an idea a picture of the one who
[1:29:40] is giving us the strength to not just
[1:29:45] make
[1:29:48] it we're not going to barely make
[1:29:52] it we are overcome comers right we are
[1:29:56] thrivers we will overcome in the end
[1:30:00] time we're going to overcome the spirit
[1:30:03] of this age and every other age that is
[1:30:06] culminated in this one we're going to
[1:30:08] overcome and the way that we're going to
[1:30:10] overcome is because the first and the
[1:30:13] last lives in US amen the one who died
[1:30:16] and gave his life that we could have
[1:30:18] life the one who shed his blood as
[1:30:21] brother Hawke preached here on Tuesday
[1:30:22] night the the the the beauty of what was
[1:30:26] done at
[1:30:27] Calvary and he didn't just stay in a
[1:30:31] tomb that's what the scripture is trying
[1:30:34] to tell us he did not just
[1:30:38] die and that was the end of it but he
[1:30:42] died and is
[1:30:46] alive it doesn't even say and was
[1:30:49] alive because Lazarus
[1:30:52] died and was
[1:30:55] alive but he died
[1:30:57] again but this one that we serve he was
[1:31:02] dead and he is
[1:31:05] alive he's alive today and he dwells
[1:31:09] inside of us Isaiah 41:4 who hath
[1:31:13] wrought and done it calling the
[1:31:15] generations from the beginning I the
[1:31:19] Lord the First with the last I am he
[1:31:25] Isaiah 44:6 thus saith the Lord the king
[1:31:28] of Israel and his Redeemer the Lord of
[1:31:31] host I am the first and I am the last
[1:31:35] and besides me there is no
[1:31:40] God the one in the
[1:31:42] beginning the creator of Heaven and
[1:31:45] Earth the creator of sun moon and stars
[1:31:48] the creator of all the seeds the creator
[1:31:52] of all the beasts that one he was the
[1:31:55] first and he is also the last Isaiah
[1:31:58] 48:12 hearken unto me oh Jacob and
[1:32:01] Israel my called I am he I am the first
[1:32:05] and also am the
[1:32:11] last
[1:32:13] now here's where it goes
[1:32:18] from God above
[1:32:22] us to now go God With Us 1 Corinthians
[1:32:27] 15:45 and so it is written the first man
[1:32:30] Adam was made a living Soul the last
[1:32:34] Adam was made a quickening spirit the
[1:32:38] first and the last the first God
[1:32:40] Almighty don't let's not get confused
[1:32:43] but I wanted to draw attention here to
[1:32:45] the last Adam was made a quickening
[1:32:48] spirit it is the same Spirit if this
[1:32:51] spirit that raised up Jesus from the
[1:32:53] dead dead dwell in you it will also
[1:32:57] Quicken your mortal
[1:33:05] bodies it's definitely going to Quick
[1:33:08] our new Quicken our new
[1:33:10] body but it says it's going to Quicken
[1:33:13] our mortal body the one we're living in
[1:33:16] right now The Same Spirit if the same
[1:33:20] spirit that dwelt in Jesus dwells in you
[1:33:23] if will also Quicken your mortal
[1:33:27] body it will do something inside of you
[1:33:32] it will do something outside of you it
[1:33:35] will do something all over you and when
[1:33:39] you get under that quickening Spirit you
[1:33:42] know we're we're recognizing that we've
[1:33:47] talked some about what the feelings have
[1:33:50] to do with
[1:33:51] it and we're not basing our walk with
[1:33:55] the Lord on how we feel right this
[1:33:57] second or what it feels like on Monday
[1:34:01] morning but we do know that there is a
[1:34:04] feeling that comes with that quickening
[1:34:07] power there is something I mean he did
[1:34:10] not give us that scripture if the spirit
[1:34:13] that dwells in you uh if the same spirit
[1:34:17] that raised him from the dead dwells in
[1:34:19] you it'll Quicken your mortal bodies he
[1:34:21] must have known that there were some
[1:34:23] Mondays
[1:34:24] that we needed a
[1:34:26] quickening there were some Sundays that
[1:34:29] we needed a quickening there were some
[1:34:31] Fridays that we needed a quickening
[1:34:33] there was some times that we needed uh a
[1:34:40] feeling there were some times that we
[1:34:43] needed a Feeling
[1:35:06] you husbands ever tell your wives I just
[1:35:09] need a
[1:35:13] hug you wives tell your husbands I just
[1:35:16] need a hug your children come to you I
[1:35:19] just need a
[1:35:21] hug now imagine
[1:35:27] imagine what it would be
[1:35:30] like if
[1:35:32] whoever said I need a hug couldn't feel
[1:35:48] it when he comes with his
[1:35:52] presence my Mor mortal body responds to
[1:35:56] it when he comes with his
[1:36:00] hug my mortal body responds to it there
[1:36:04] is a feeling to
[1:36:06] it he is the first and the last he is
[1:36:11] the one who was dead and is now alive
[1:36:14] and because that he was dead and is now
[1:36:17] alive he wants that same spirit that
[1:36:20] raised him up from the dead he wants it
[1:36:23] to dwell inside of you to raise up and
[1:36:26] Quicken your mortal body not just after
[1:36:29] you're dead and you need to be raised up
[1:36:31] out of the ground no he wants it to be
[1:36:34] why you're in this Mortal body you're
[1:36:36] living in this realm and his presence
[1:36:39] comes to you he wants you to recognize
[1:36:42] that he is alive and that he wants to
[1:36:45] dwell in you and he wants you to feel
[1:36:49] it do I live my life on
[1:36:52] feelings if I did I'd have quit
[1:36:55] already if you did you'd have quit
[1:36:59] already so we keep coming back to the
[1:37:02] well we keep coming back to his
[1:37:06] presence he is alive uh Revelation chap
[1:37:10] 1 ver 17 to 19 we already read when I
[1:37:14] saw him I fell at his feet as dead and
[1:37:16] he laid his right hand on me and said
[1:37:19] fear not I am the first and the last I
[1:37:22] am he that live liveth and was dead and
[1:37:25] behold I am alive forever more amen and
[1:37:30] have the keys of hell and of death so we
[1:37:34] have the first and the last we have the
[1:37:38] one who holds the seven uh angels in his
[1:37:42] hand and walks among the seven churches
[1:37:44] we have the one who was dead and is
[1:37:47] alive he is he is who we are looking at
[1:37:50] today he is the one who is abiding in us
[1:37:54] to give us the grace and the courage and
[1:37:56] the strength to be able to go through
[1:37:59] this world where that we're dealing with
[1:38:01] all of this
[1:38:02] evil then in pergamus it it gives his
[1:38:06] desri description as he which hath the
[1:38:10] sharp sword with two
[1:38:15] edges he hath the sharp sword with two
[1:38:21] edges now I chose to read from Hebrews
[1:38:25] 4:12 which we have heard many times from
[1:38:28] this pulpit in the Amplified version for
[1:38:31] the word that God speaks is alive and
[1:38:36] full of
[1:38:37] power making it
[1:38:40] active
[1:38:42] operative
[1:38:44] energizing and
[1:38:49] effective
[1:38:51] active operative
[1:38:54] energizing and
[1:38:58] effective it is sharper than any
[1:39:00] two-edged
[1:39:02] sword penetrating to the dividing line
[1:39:05] of the Breath of Life the soul and the
[1:39:09] immortal spirit and of the joints and
[1:39:12] Marrow of the deepest parts of our
[1:39:15] nature
[1:39:17] exposing and
[1:39:19] sifting and
[1:39:21] analyzing and judging the very
[1:39:26] thoughts
[1:39:28] and
[1:39:30] purposes of the
[1:39:34] heart now let's just stop and think
[1:39:36] about this
[1:39:38] sword we know that the word of God is
[1:39:42] referred to as the
[1:39:44] sword we know that it is alive and it is
[1:39:48] full of
[1:39:49] power but it's not just a written
[1:39:56] book because for
[1:39:59] some this is just words on a
[1:40:06] page and most of us that are sitting
[1:40:09] here
[1:40:10] today have had at least one period in
[1:40:13] our life where it was just words on a
[1:40:20] page it was not a alive and full of
[1:40:25] power it was not active it was not
[1:40:30] operative it was not
[1:40:32] energizing and it was not
[1:40:35] effective we were
[1:40:42] existing but because the god of
[1:40:45] Grace who loves us and knows us and will
[1:40:50] not leave us in that shape he comes
[1:40:53] along as the god with the sharp
[1:40:58] two-edged sword in his
[1:41:01] mouth and if we were in that kind of a
[1:41:04] shape and we belong to him there is
[1:41:07] somewhere some way somehow whether it be
[1:41:11] across a pull pit whether it be a song
[1:41:15] whether it be uh listening to the radio
[1:41:18] hearing a preacher or a recorded sermon
[1:41:20] or something that would all of the
[1:41:23] sudden that that sharp two-edged sword
[1:41:27] would penetrate to the dividing line of
[1:41:31] the soul and the spirit to where that
[1:41:34] our emotions or emotionless could be cut
[1:41:38] out of the way and that sword could go
[1:41:40] all the way into our spirit man and the
[1:41:44] word of God could get to the seed that
[1:41:47] has been there all along and it begins
[1:41:50] to become again active and operative and
[1:41:54] energizing and
[1:41:57] effective it's no longer
[1:42:00] dead but the
[1:42:04] sword the sword of the word that
[1:42:07] proceeds from his mouth when it speaks
[1:42:10] it is alive and full of power you may
[1:42:13] say Okay preacher I have set in a church
[1:42:16] and I heard the word and it did nothing
[1:42:20] for
[1:42:22] me could probably all say
[1:42:25] that at you know a spot in our
[1:42:30] life we're not talking necessarily about
[1:42:33] today a spot in our life where that
[1:42:37] right beside of us somebody was getting
[1:42:40] so happy they couldn't keep in their
[1:42:42] seat and we're sitting there
[1:42:45] thinking what was so good about
[1:42:52] that it almost seems Blasphemous to even
[1:42:55] say
[1:42:56] it but we're Humanity we realize that
[1:42:59] these things have happened in our life
[1:43:02] and by the grace of God that's not where
[1:43:04] we are
[1:43:05] today because
[1:43:09] somehow there was a spoken word at a due
[1:43:13] season that came to us and it energized
[1:43:17] us right up out of our seat out of our
[1:43:20] place of of of of just being crabby and
[1:43:24] grouchy and not being able to be kind to
[1:43:27] anyone and it pulled us up and out of
[1:43:30] that place where we are because it was
[1:43:32] the right word in the due season and
[1:43:34] it's that sharp two-edged sword that
[1:43:37] comes out of his
[1:43:38] mouth that is why you can't discount The
[1:43:47] Vessel if if you see my Humanity
[1:43:54] while the preaching of the word is going
[1:43:57] on I'm sorry I don't want you
[1:44:01] to I don't want you to see my Humanity
[1:44:04] all through the
[1:44:06] week but it comes out yes it
[1:44:09] does yet when a preacher gets under the
[1:44:12] anointing of the Holy Spirit you better
[1:44:15] retune your frequency because you're no
[1:44:17] longer listen to humanity you're
[1:44:20] listening to the sharp two-edged sword
[1:44:23] of the Lord that is being spoken and it
[1:44:25] is a word that you need to hear it is a
[1:44:28] word that can set you free it is a word
[1:44:31] that can help you to combat the evil
[1:44:34] that you are
[1:44:39] facing that's why we come to the house
[1:44:41] of the Lord to hear the word of the Lord
[1:44:44] because the sharp two-edged sword of the
[1:44:46] word Finds Its Mark the word will not
[1:44:50] return
[1:44:51] void word god but it will
[1:44:55] accomplish where to it is
[1:44:59] sent I will not return
[1:45:02] void but his word that is preached will
[1:45:05] not return void it will find its
[1:45:09] mark and it will strengthen and
[1:45:13] energize and become active in somebody's
[1:45:16] life because that's what the sharp
[1:45:19] two-edged sword does it is active and
[1:45:22] operative and energizing and
[1:45:25] effective
[1:45:29] sir
[1:45:31] effective it is effective in our
[1:45:36] lives when we have the right mental
[1:45:39] attitude toward the word of God is is it
[1:45:42] is effective in our life if we do not
[1:45:46] have the right mental attitude toward
[1:45:48] the word of God it will not be effective
[1:45:51] in a if we're just like ham he said it
[1:45:54] would work but I don't know if it's
[1:45:56] going to or not it he said that this is
[1:45:58] what would help me but I don't know I
[1:46:00] you know I've got so many things on my
[1:46:02] head right now I don't know
[1:46:04] if the word of God is
[1:46:08] effective but it takes our cooperation
[1:46:12] in agreeing with his word it takes our
[1:46:15] cooperation in knowing that the word of
[1:46:18] God is for us it is for our benefit it
[1:46:21] is to help us to overcome in the end
[1:46:24] time it is for us to be able to overcome
[1:46:30] the spirit of Darkness that surrounds us
[1:46:33] Psalm 149 veres
[1:46:35] 1-9 praise ye the
[1:46:41] Lord I got the wrong one Psalm
[1:46:44] 149 praise ye the Lord sing unto the
[1:46:48] Lord a new song and his praise in the
[1:46:51] congregation of Saints let Israel
[1:46:55] rejoice in him that made him let the
[1:46:58] children of Zion be joyful in their King
[1:47:02] let them praise His name in The Dance
[1:47:05] Let Them sing praises unto him with the
[1:47:08] timberl and
[1:47:11] harp for the lord taketh pleasure in his
[1:47:14] people he will beautify the meek with
[1:47:18] salvation let the Saints be joyful in
[1:47:22] glory
[1:47:23] let them sing aloud upon their
[1:47:26] beds let the high praises of God be in
[1:47:30] their mouth and a two-edged sword in
[1:47:33] their hand I thought it was supposed to
[1:47:36] be in our
[1:47:38] mouth well let me
[1:47:41] just maybe rephrase this a little bit
[1:47:58] this is a two-edged
[1:48:02] sword very obviously it's in my
[1:48:07] hand I just like to ask you
[1:48:11] something what good is this going to do
[1:48:14] me when I'm fighting a spiritual
[1:48:20] battle this natural sword in my
[1:48:24] hand I could hurt somebody with it might
[1:48:27] even hurt
[1:48:30] myself because I'm not an experienced
[1:48:32] sword
[1:48:33] wielder it's pretty heavy as a matter of
[1:48:37] fact and you know I could do physical
[1:48:41] damage but in a spiritual battle this
[1:48:45] natural weapon is not going to do me any
[1:48:51] good so
[1:48:54] let's look at this
[1:48:57] again let the high praises of God be in
[1:49:02] your
[1:49:05] mouth the high praises of God coming out
[1:49:08] of your mouth becomes the two-edged
[1:49:10] sword in your
[1:49:13] hand the Praises that come out of your
[1:49:16] mouth to the one who can do something
[1:49:18] about it becomes the two-edged sword
[1:49:23] because it becomes a word in your
[1:49:26] mouth that remember we've just read in
[1:49:30] in the Amplified Hebrews 4:12 that the
[1:49:32] word is active it's
[1:49:37] energizing it's
[1:49:39] effective it's
[1:49:42] working and we are participating with
[1:49:45] that word and giving praise to the one
[1:49:49] who gave us the word who is able to do
[1:49:52] something about it I can't do nothing
[1:49:55] with this to overcome the demons in my
[1:50:01] life it would be nice
[1:50:04] sometimes to be able to just hack
[1:50:07] somebody's head off you know I'm talking
[1:50:11] spirits because we don't fight flesh and
[1:50:14] blood in this spiritual
[1:50:17] warfare sometimes we think it would be
[1:50:19] easier if they would get right in front
[1:50:21] of us these spirits of darkness and we
[1:50:23] could take a physical sword and cut
[1:50:25] their head
[1:50:26] off we think it would be nice just to be
[1:50:29] ended with that one but that's not how
[1:50:32] spiritual warfare is done spiritual
[1:50:34] warfare is done by praising the one who
[1:50:38] gives us the grace to overcome these
[1:50:41] things and our praise out of our mouth
[1:50:43] becomes a sharp two-edged
[1:50:46] sword and it it the two-edged sword the
[1:50:50] high praises of God that is what
[1:50:52] executes judgment upon the Heathen and
[1:50:56] punishments upon the
[1:51:00] people in the older
[1:51:03] Covenant God gave commandment time and
[1:51:08] again to go eliminate a whole group of
[1:51:14] people I don't like what they're doing I
[1:51:17] don't like the way they act I don't like
[1:51:19] the idols they worship I want you to go
[1:51:21] and I want you to cut off the whole
[1:51:25] race we now live under a different
[1:51:28] Covenant we are under the Covenant of
[1:51:31] the Lord Jesus Christ and he is the one
[1:51:35] he he is the one who says vengeance is
[1:51:37] mine sayith the Lord I will repay and so
[1:51:41] if if he has given himself as the sharp
[1:51:46] twoed sword that is active and operative
[1:51:48] and energizing and effective then we
[1:51:51] want to be able to give him praise and
[1:51:54] and Lord Praises on him and thank him
[1:51:57] for all of his mighty acts and all of
[1:51:59] his mighty works because he is the one
[1:52:02] who has already defeated all of these
[1:52:04] things on our behalf and so we're coming
[1:52:07] into agreement with him by giving him
[1:52:09] the praise and the honor that he
[1:52:11] deserves so that he in turn takes care
[1:52:14] of these spirits
[1:52:25] we all wish that we knew better how
[1:52:30] to do spiritual
[1:52:35] warfare we wish that we
[1:52:38] knew sometimes what exactly we were
[1:52:42] fighting
[1:52:44] against that we could name it by name
[1:52:48] and tell it to go back where it came
[1:52:49] from
[1:52:53] and many times the Lord does not allow
[1:52:55] that for
[1:52:57] us
[1:52:59] so the best thing that we can do is
[1:53:03] we let the Saints be joyful in glory and
[1:53:08] let them sing aloud upon their beds
[1:53:10] because you know these demon Spirits
[1:53:11] like Darkness that's you know when
[1:53:13] you're laying in your bed and you wake
[1:53:15] up in the middle of the night and and
[1:53:17] all of a sudden this sense of fear comes
[1:53:19] over you and and for no apparent re
[1:53:22] reason a spirit of fear comes over you
[1:53:24] and you feel constricted and and that's
[1:53:28] what he's saying sing aloud let him sing
[1:53:30] aloud upon their beds let the high
[1:53:32] praises of God be in their mouth and a
[1:53:34] two-edged sword in their hand the high
[1:53:37] praises of God becomes The two-edged
[1:53:39] Sword and the demons have to scatter the
[1:53:42] fear has to leave because it is no
[1:53:45] longer the a fear that is in your mind
[1:53:48] but it is given praise to the one who
[1:53:51] the two-edged who is is the two-edged
[1:53:53] sword his M out of his mouth is the
[1:53:55] two-edged sword and our mouth is
[1:53:58] becoming his mouth and letting the
[1:54:00] Praises come out giving to him the glory
[1:54:03] that is due to his name it's going to
[1:54:05] execute judgment upon the Heathen it's
[1:54:08] going to bring punishments upon the
[1:54:09] people it's going to bind Kings with
[1:54:12] chains yes sir and their nobles with
[1:54:16] FEDS of iron to execute upon them the
[1:54:19] Judgment written this honor have all his
[1:54:25] Saints praise ye the Lord
[1:54:31] now if we as a people or as individuals
[1:54:37] could see the
[1:54:40] hierarchy of the spiritual
[1:54:46] Kingdom
[1:54:48] and they're not all underlings
[1:54:53] there are levels
[1:54:56] of the hierarchy in the Demonic Kingdom
[1:55:01] that they they they VI for attention
[1:55:04] they fight for
[1:55:08] position you may ask me how do you know
[1:55:14] that the first thing that I would tell
[1:55:17] you is that their
[1:55:20] father ended up kicked out of of Heaven
[1:55:23] for that very
[1:55:25] reason because he wasn't satisfied with
[1:55:28] his position and so he made a
[1:55:30] determination in his heart that he was
[1:55:33] going to get a bigger and a better and a
[1:55:36] more prominent position because he
[1:55:38] wanted to be the head honcho and so all
[1:55:42] of his underlings The Same Spirit abides
[1:55:45] on them and that's what they want to do
[1:55:48] and so when you find yourself
[1:55:53] trying to kick somebody else out of the
[1:55:56] way so that you can climb
[1:56:02] higher you need to question
[1:56:05] yourself have I let that kind of a
[1:56:08] spirit get on me right God forbid we
[1:56:12] don't want that but the reason I brought
[1:56:14] that up is because these last three
[1:56:17] verses uh to execute judgment on the
[1:56:20] Heathen punishments upon the people bind
[1:56:23] their kings with chains and their nobles
[1:56:26] with feathers of iron to execute upon
[1:56:28] them the Judgment written this honor
[1:56:31] have all his Saints now this was written
[1:56:33] in the time of David when they were
[1:56:35] really taking out physical people
[1:56:38] killing
[1:56:40] them we are in a spiritual
[1:56:44] battle where that again we can't take
[1:56:47] and hack their heads off with a
[1:56:50] sword that's how you end up in jail
[1:56:53] how you end up in
[1:56:54] prison that's not what we've been called
[1:56:57] to we've been called to a higher calling
[1:57:00] than that and by the sharp two-edged
[1:57:02] sword that comes out of our mouth by
[1:57:05] speaking the word in due season by
[1:57:08] praising him and giving him honor and
[1:57:11] glory for all of his wondrous works that
[1:57:14] he has done already and all of the ones
[1:57:16] that he will do and is doing it becomes
[1:57:20] the word out of our mouth that is active
[1:57:23] and energizing and effective it's the
[1:57:25] word that's going to do something and
[1:57:28] it's going to do something in that dark
[1:57:30] kingdom to bring down all those things
[1:57:33] that are against us that are trying to
[1:57:35] take us
[1:57:38] out well we're not moving very
[1:57:41] fast
[1:57:43] thyra the Son of God who hath his eyes
[1:57:46] like unto a flame of fire and his feet
[1:57:50] are like fine brass
[1:57:55] the Son of God the one who condescended
[1:57:59] became
[1:58:00] flesh and the scripture tells us that
[1:58:03] his eyes now again I want us to remember
[1:58:06] why we're even looking at this study
[1:58:07] it's because he is the one who is giving
[1:58:11] us the strength he is the one who abides
[1:58:14] in us to be able to fight and combat all
[1:58:16] of this evil that we're fighting and
[1:58:18] each age had if you look at what I am
[1:58:22] giving to you from chapter 2 you can put
[1:58:26] it right back into chapter one right but
[1:58:29] each age what John saw in
[1:58:34] totality each age got in a
[1:58:38] measure so his eyes like a flame of fire
[1:58:42] and his feet are like fine brass Daniel
[1:58:46] 106 puts it this way his body also was
[1:58:50] like the burl and his face as the
[1:58:53] appearance of lightning and his eyes as
[1:58:56] lamps of fire and his arms and his feet
[1:58:59] like in color to Polished brass and the
[1:59:02] voice of his words like the voice of a
[1:59:05] multitude so I want you to take notice
[1:59:08] here that in Daniel 10 that it says eyes
[1:59:12] as lamps and both of those are plural
[1:59:16] plural words eyes and
[1:59:18] lamps but in Revelation 1114 and in
[1:59:22] Revelation 2:18 it gives eyes
[1:59:26] plural and a flame
[1:59:31] singular and that makes me think of Luke
[1:59:34] 11:34 the light of the body is the eye
[1:59:37] therefore when thine eye is single the
[1:59:40] whole body also is full of light but
[1:59:43] when thy eye is evil thy body also is
[1:59:48] full of darkness and so let's let's just
[1:59:51] f focus in here on this uh the eyes as a
[1:59:55] flame of fire now we have sung a song
[1:59:58] about that fire in his eyes is his love
[2:00:03] for his bride all right now he is
[2:00:08] looking at us brother Shelly has been
[2:00:10] talking to us over the last several
[2:00:12] weeks about the difference between envy
[2:00:15] and
[2:00:17] jealousy now our God is a jealous God
[2:00:22] and the reason that he is jealous is
[2:00:25] because we belong to him and because
[2:00:29] that I belong to him his eyes are singly
[2:00:34] on
[2:00:35] me they are they're not here flitting
[2:00:38] here and there and everywhere they're
[2:00:40] singly on me because he is jealous over
[2:00:44] me he is jealous over my destiny he is
[2:00:49] jealous that I make it all the way to
[2:00:52] the end he is jealous that I make it and
[2:00:55] overcome because I am
[2:01:00] his and he's not going to share
[2:01:03] me I'm
[2:01:06] his I belong to him and he's jealous for
[2:01:12] me because I'm
[2:01:15] his
[2:01:17] exclusively
[2:01:19] his we get sidetracked
[2:01:23] the
[2:01:24] enemy we give him
[2:01:27] room we get sidetracked and we allow the
[2:01:31] enemy you know we have these little
[2:01:35] trist with the
[2:01:40] devil but God is
[2:01:44] jealous because I'm
[2:01:48] his and this fire that is in his eyes
[2:01:54] is going to
[2:01:56] obliterate the
[2:01:58] enemy because I'm his and he's not going
[2:02:02] to share me with another I'm
[2:02:07] his you get it you're his and he's
[2:02:11] jealous for you and his eyes are like
[2:02:14] flames of fire and the body says that
[2:02:17] his his feet are like fine brass
[2:02:21] I just like to read a quotation to you
[2:02:24] to help you to better understand the
[2:02:27] brass the feet of
[2:02:30] brass look this is from a message the
[2:02:34] patmas
[2:02:36] vision from 1960 look at what this was
[2:02:40] here standing there brass what does
[2:02:44] brass speak
[2:02:46] of brass speaks of judgment Divine
[2:02:50] judgment
[2:02:52] it shows that his full purpose is coming
[2:02:56] here on Earth as God to be made flesh
[2:03:00] and he died for us and took the
[2:03:03] judgments of
[2:03:08] God we're not standing around like this
[2:03:12] waiting for the next shoe to
[2:03:14] fall because of his feet of
[2:03:19] brass maybe at first look that that's
[2:03:21] what you think of when he has feet of
[2:03:25] brass that he's going to crunch you
[2:03:28] under his feet oh no this right here is
[2:03:31] is is a beautiful thing to to hear when
[2:03:35] you feel that way to be made flesh he
[2:03:38] died for us and took the judgments of
[2:03:40] God the Divine judgment and has received
[2:03:42] a kingdom that's brass and solid and it
[2:03:45] cannot be moved nothing harder than
[2:03:47] brass and never nothing would yet uh
[2:03:50] nothing found yet that would temperate
[2:03:52] judgment brass speaks of divine
[2:03:56] judgment
[2:03:58] P look at the brass serpent in the
[2:04:01] wilderness what did that brass serpent
[2:04:03] represent the serpent represented sin
[2:04:06] but being brass judgment already passed
[2:04:11] on
[2:04:12] sin this feet of brass is
[2:04:16] representation that the Judgment has
[2:04:19] already been put against my
[2:04:23] sin he has a fire in his in his eyes
[2:04:27] that is a love a jealousy for me for my
[2:04:31] destiny for your destiny it's a love and
[2:04:34] because that he has a jealousy over you
[2:04:38] and he has his eyes on you they are
[2:04:40] fixed on you it is not because he wants
[2:04:43] to obliterate
[2:04:45] you and it is not because he wants to
[2:04:48] put his brass feet on your neck and
[2:04:51] squash you no he's letting us know that
[2:04:55] his eyes are jealous over you and over
[2:04:58] your destiny and because he was so
[2:05:01] jealous for your destiny the feet of
[2:05:03] brass that representation that he put
[2:05:06] his foot on the head of sin and he
[2:05:10] overcame it he put it under his feet
[2:05:13] when he died at Calvary and went to the
[2:05:15] lower parts of the earth and led
[2:05:18] captivity captive
[2:05:22] judgment was passed on
[2:05:26] sin unbelief it was passed on that what
[2:05:30] I would do what I might be doing right
[2:05:33] now and what I I've already done it's
[2:05:36] God taking care of all of it the
[2:05:38] Judgment was already passed does that
[2:05:41] make me want to go out and play in sin a
[2:05:44] while longer oh no that makes me want to
[2:05:48] say oh Lord thank you for for your
[2:05:51] cleansing blood thank you for the price
[2:05:54] that you paid at Calvary thank you that
[2:05:57] you already did for me what I could not
[2:06:00] do for
[2:06:06] myself then we come to the Sardis
[2:06:10] age and when he spoke to that age the
[2:06:14] description he gave to them was he that
[2:06:17] hath the seven spirits of God and the
[2:06:20] Seven Stars now remember we saw in
[2:06:22] chapter one again that the Seven Stars
[2:06:25] were the seven Messengers and then we
[2:06:27] see the seven spirits of God and we go
[2:06:30] to Isaiah 11: 1 and 2 there shall come
[2:06:35] forth a rod out of the stem of
[2:06:39] Jesse and a branch shall grow out of his
[2:06:42] roots and the spirit of the Lord shall
[2:06:45] rest upon
[2:06:47] him the spirit of wisdom and understand
[2:06:52] understanding the spirit of counsel and
[2:06:55] might the spirit of knowledge and of the
[2:06:59] fear the reverential awe of the
[2:07:02] Lord so
[2:07:05] now instead of just looking at a
[2:07:08] phrase we can see that there are aspects
[2:07:13] that have been given to us for
[2:07:15] overcoming in the end time the spirit of
[2:07:18] the Lord is not only resting upon him
[2:07:21] but the spirit of the Lord is resting
[2:07:23] upon
[2:07:25] us the spirit of wisdom anybody need
[2:07:29] wisdom anybody need
[2:07:32] understanding how about
[2:07:36] counsel I tell you there are sometimes
[2:07:40] we just need the counsel of the Lord and
[2:07:44] sometimes it comes through a human
[2:07:46] vessel and we have the we have the uh
[2:07:51] ability
[2:07:52] to either accept or reject the
[2:08:00] counsel and if
[2:08:04] we choose to accept
[2:08:08] it and something goes
[2:08:12] wrong we want to take Vengeance on
[2:08:18] somebody but if someone gives us counsel
[2:08:22] and we choose not to do
[2:08:24] it and we end up in trouble we still
[2:08:28] want to blame
[2:08:30] somebody this is human
[2:08:34] nature but it's not God
[2:08:38] nature it's human nature but it's not
[2:08:41] God nature and we want to get rid of as
[2:08:44] much of the human nature the adamic
[2:08:47] nature as possible because that is not
[2:08:52] going to give us what we need to
[2:08:54] overcome in the end time all right so
[2:08:57] the spirit of wisdom and understanding
[2:09:00] the spirit of counsel and might the
[2:09:02] spirit of
[2:09:04] knowledge and the reverential a or the
[2:09:07] fear of the Lord these are all things
[2:09:10] that were are needed that we when when
[2:09:13] he gave us himself when he gave us his
[2:09:16] Spirit he poured out his spirit so that
[2:09:19] all of these things would abide in US us
[2:09:22] it's not just so far out there
[2:09:25] friends it's not out of our
[2:09:32] reach sometimes we do feel like he's
[2:09:34] playing hideand-seek with
[2:09:37] us yet all of the things that we're
[2:09:40] talking about today he's offering them
[2:09:43] to
[2:09:44] us you know what he wants out of
[2:09:47] Us come a little closer
[2:09:51] just come a little
[2:09:53] closer you're way too far out there I've
[2:09:56] got him right here come a little
[2:09:59] closer and sometimes we're so far
[2:10:02] out that he has to come a little closer
[2:10:05] to us so that we can even see
[2:10:08] him and then we think he's playing
[2:10:10] hideand-seek because he backs off
[2:10:13] because he wants us to follow him and we
[2:10:15] don't want to follow him and he backs
[2:10:18] off and it feels like a game of
[2:10:20] hideand-seek seat Lord you told me to
[2:10:22] follow you and now I can't even find
[2:10:25] you what are you looking
[2:10:28] at what are you looking
[2:10:34] at is your eye single like his eye is
[2:10:39] single or or are you focused on Sunday
[2:10:44] but not
[2:10:46] Monday Tuesday but not
[2:10:49] Wednesday and so it feels like a game of
[2:10:52] hide and seek but he's really biding you
[2:10:55] to come closer come closer Come Away
[2:10:58] With Me My Love My Fair one all right
[2:11:03] Philadelphia then we have he that is
[2:11:06] Holy he that is true he that hath the
[2:11:10] Key of
[2:11:11] David he that openeth and no man
[2:11:14] shutteth and shutteth and no man
[2:11:19] openeth now there are a lot of things
[2:11:21] that we could there are several here and
[2:11:24] we we're going to have to move fairly
[2:11:26] quickly 1 Peter 1: 15- 17 but as he
[2:11:32] which hath called you is
[2:11:34] Holy so be ye holy in all manner
[2:11:39] of
[2:11:44] conversation we could talk quite a while
[2:11:48] about that one our conversation
[2:11:56] those things that are spoken in
[2:12:02] secret things that we really don't want
[2:12:05] anybody else to
[2:12:08] hear that are not
[2:12:10] holy they're not Sanctified they're not
[2:12:13] set apart they're
[2:12:18] self-serving and that's not what a
[2:12:20] believer is to
[2:12:22] be
[2:12:26] self-serving we are to be
[2:12:29] selfless so be ye holy in all manner of
[2:12:34] conversation because it is written be ye
[2:12:39] holy for I am
[2:12:42] Holy all right then we have he is true
[2:12:46] he that is true and we know the
[2:12:48] scripture I don't have it written down
[2:12:50] here where he said I am the way and the
[2:12:54] truth and the
[2:12:57] life that's who he is there's no
[2:13:01] falsehood in
[2:13:03] him
[2:13:06] none I as a human being may have the
[2:13:09] ability to lead you astray it's not my
[2:13:11] desire but I have the ability there
[2:13:14] whereas him he is truth everything about
[2:13:17] him is true that's who he is
[2:13:23] and it also says that he has the Key of
[2:13:26] David he opens and no man shuts shuts no
[2:13:29] man open let me just tell you he has all
[2:13:32] the
[2:13:37] keys I know he gave Peter the Keys of
[2:13:40] the Kingdom he passed the keys along to
[2:13:43] us the Keys of the Kingdom we have the
[2:13:45] keys but the reason that we have the
[2:13:46] keys is because he had the keys right
[2:13:50] and the reason that we have the keys of
[2:13:52] death Hell In The Grave is because he
[2:13:54] has the keys he passed them on to us
[2:13:58] that we don't have to be worried about
[2:14:00] what is beyond the grave we don't have
[2:14:02] to be worried that we're not going to
[2:14:04] make it we don't have to be worried am I
[2:14:06] saved or am I lost he gave us the
[2:14:09] key and when he opens the
[2:14:12] door no man can shut it and when he
[2:14:16] shuts a door no man can open it and far
[2:14:19] be it from you or me to uh take a
[2:14:22] crowbar and try to open it what usually
[2:14:26] ends up happening is shipwreck train
[2:14:28] wreck something bad that happens when we
[2:14:31] try to open a door that he has shut we
[2:14:34] need to leave it shut we need to let the
[2:14:37] vines grow up over it we need to let it
[2:14:40] be behind us and we need to walk through
[2:14:43] the door that he has opened for us to
[2:14:45] walk through and quit worrying about
[2:14:47] what has
[2:14:49] passed because what is is
[2:14:52] PED is
[2:14:54] PED forgetting those things which are
[2:14:58] behind us if the door has closed let it
[2:15:01] stay closed if there's a door that's
[2:15:04] opened he is the one who has the keys
[2:15:07] and he opened the door in front of you
[2:15:10] and he gives us the grace to walk
[2:15:12] through it and we want to see he he gave
[2:15:15] he's he has the Key of David and David
[2:15:19] was a praiser
[2:15:21] David had a voice that he lifted up unto
[2:15:25] the Lord and sang Pray when David was in
[2:15:28] a place where that he felt helpless and
[2:15:33] hopeless he found that praise brought
[2:15:36] him up out of his place that he was
[2:15:41] in we already read in Revelation chapter
[2:15:44] 1 verse 18 where he said I am he that
[2:15:47] liveth and was dead and behold I'm alive
[2:15:49] forever more amen and have the keys of
[2:15:52] hell and of
[2:15:54] death
[2:15:56] and we read in John chap 10 Again verses
[2:16:00] 7-10 then said Jesus unto them again
[2:16:03] verily verily I say unto you I am the
[2:16:08] door of the
[2:16:11] sheep all that ever came before me are
[2:16:14] thieves and robbers but the Sheep did
[2:16:18] not hear
[2:16:19] them I am the
[2:16:21] door by me if any man enter in he shall
[2:16:26] be saved and shall go in and out and
[2:16:29] find
[2:16:31] pasture the thief cometh
[2:16:35] not but for to
[2:16:39] kill and to destroy to steal to kill and
[2:16:45] to
[2:16:46] destroy I am come that they might have
[2:16:49] life and that they might might have it
[2:16:52] more
[2:16:54] abundantly now if he's the door and he
[2:16:56] has the keys to be able to shut and to
[2:16:59] open we as a people need to look at the
[2:17:02] characteristics of what kind of doors
[2:17:05] that the the enemy
[2:17:09] offers because we've been given right
[2:17:11] here the the uh ingredients of what the
[2:17:16] thief is trying to do he's trying to
[2:17:19] steal
[2:17:21] he's trying to
[2:17:23] kill he's trying to
[2:17:27] destroy that's what he does when he
[2:17:29] opens the door for you that's what
[2:17:32] inevitably
[2:17:33] happens he steals he kills and he
[2:17:39] destroys and that goes across so many
[2:17:44] spectrums when you use those three words
[2:17:47] steal kill and destroy it goes across so
[2:17:51] many spectrums of what the enemy tries
[2:17:53] to do in our lives but our Lord is the
[2:17:56] door he has the keys of the door and
[2:18:00] when we allow him to open and shut doors
[2:18:03] and lead us into places when he shuts
[2:18:06] one and leads us into another we're
[2:18:08] we're allowing this um we're allowing
[2:18:12] this Pathway to be created for us that
[2:18:16] is going to help us to overcome in the
[2:18:20] end time
[2:18:21] time to overcome the spirit of the age
[2:18:24] we don't have time to go through all of
[2:18:26] these Spirits right now but uh maybe
[2:18:28] eventually we will so let's get Leo deia
[2:18:31] he says uh he's the
[2:18:36] amen he's the faithful and true
[2:18:39] witness he's the beginning of the
[2:18:41] creation of
[2:18:46] God he's the
[2:18:48] amen now I I I found found it very
[2:18:51] interesting as I just quickly looked at
[2:18:54] the word amen in the Greek
[2:18:58] Lexicon
[2:19:00] and many times in the scripture
[2:19:03] especially in the gospels where you hear
[2:19:06] Jesus saying
[2:19:08] verily or verily
[2:19:11] verily it's the same Greek word as
[2:19:17] amen so at the beginning of a discourse
[2:19:20] of course it means
[2:19:23] surely
[2:19:24] truly and of a
[2:19:27] truth and at the end of a discourse it
[2:19:30] is so it is so be it and may it be
[2:19:36] fulfilled now our Lord Yeshua he is the
[2:19:45] amen he is at the beginning of a
[2:19:49] discourse he is surely he is truly and
[2:19:53] he is of a truth he's never going to
[2:19:56] lead you
[2:19:57] wrong at the be remember he's the first
[2:20:00] and the last so at the
[2:20:02] first he is presenting himself as truth
[2:20:06] right he's not going to lie to you he's
[2:20:10] not going to tell you an untruth he's
[2:20:12] going to give you the truth because he
[2:20:15] is the
[2:20:16] truth and so at the beginning of the
[2:20:19] discourse at the beginning of our
[2:20:20] Journey we can really say
[2:20:25] amen and when we get to the end of it we
[2:20:28] can also say Amen because he is the one
[2:20:32] that is giving the truth and we are
[2:20:35] agreeing with that truth and when we say
[2:20:37] Amen we are putting our pronouncement of
[2:20:41] so be
[2:20:42] it let it be
[2:20:45] so you give a truth let it be so
[2:20:55] let's just
[2:20:57] take
[2:21:00] quickly leod
[2:21:02] deia what is the prominent Spirit of
[2:21:07] leoda from the
[2:21:10] scripture The prominent Spirit of leoda
[2:21:14] is
[2:21:18] lukewarm and he said because you are
[2:21:21] lukewarm and neither cold nor
[2:21:25] hot I'll spew you out of my
[2:21:31] mouth he is the amen he started it he's
[2:21:36] going to finish it what is the rest of
[2:21:38] this he's the faithful and true witness
[2:21:39] he's the beginning of the creation of
[2:21:41] God now what has been given this part of
[2:21:45] him that has been given for the leod
[2:21:47] deia age which The prominent spirit is
[2:21:50] lukewarmness he is the amen so that
[2:21:53] means when he speaks and gives a word
[2:21:58] it's
[2:21:58] truth and it is truth that is going to
[2:22:01] help you to overcome your
[2:22:03] lukewarmness and when a truth is given
[2:22:07] and you pronounce with him an amen over
[2:22:10] it he is the amen he is the Sobe it he
[2:22:14] is the one that's going to carry it out
[2:22:15] in your life he's the one who's going to
[2:22:18] give you the Courage the grace the
[2:22:20] understanding to be able to overcome
[2:22:22] lukewarmness in this age because it's
[2:22:25] going to press in in every way and when
[2:22:27] you can agree with
[2:22:33] truth the scripture says Thy word is
[2:22:37] truth when you agree with the
[2:22:42] word not why my word not another man's
[2:22:45] word but the word the Living God when
[2:22:48] you agree with him when you agree with
[2:22:50] the amen and you pronounce your amen
[2:22:53] with his amen you are going to see that
[2:22:56] lukewarmness leaving your life you're
[2:22:59] going to see that lukewarmness going by
[2:23:01] the wayside the problem is because that
[2:23:04] lukewarmness is pressing in on us in
[2:23:06] every
[2:23:16] way shall I give you an updated term for
[2:23:19] lukewarmness
[2:23:27] woke
[2:23:33] woke let everybody be what they want to
[2:23:41] be and then companies adopt policies to
[2:23:46] be able
[2:23:48] to make welcome the woke
[2:23:53] society and you see the condition that
[2:23:55] they're in and they have to start
[2:23:56] reversing
[2:23:58] it because they're finding out that
[2:24:01] lukewarmness ain't helping their company
[2:24:05] that's no more than lukewarmness is
[2:24:07] going to help you to overcome and combat
[2:24:09] the spirit of the age he said I would
[2:24:12] that you would be hot or cold and when I
[2:24:15] hear him say that when I hear the amen
[2:24:19] say that I agree agree with the amen I
[2:24:22] agree with the sobeit I agree with the
[2:24:25] truth of the age because the truth is
[2:24:29] what makes us free you shall know the
[2:24:32] truth and the truth shall make you
[2:24:37] free musicians I invite you
[2:24:40] today the word word amen is a most
[2:24:42] remarkable
[2:24:44] word it was transliterated directly from
[2:24:47] the Hebrew into the Greek of the New
[2:24:49] Testament
[2:24:50] then into Latin and into English and
[2:24:53] many other languages so that it is
[2:24:56] practically a universal word this was
[2:24:59] part of the commentary of the Lexicon it
[2:25:02] has been called the best known word in
[2:25:05] human speech the word is directly
[2:25:08] related in fact almost identical to the
[2:25:12] Hebrew word for
[2:25:15] believe
[2:25:17] amen or faithful thus it came to mean
[2:25:22] sure or truly an expression of absolute
[2:25:26] trust and
[2:25:28] confidence trust and
[2:25:32] confidence again verse 17 and 18 of the
[2:25:35] first chapter when I saw him I fell at
[2:25:37] his feet as dead and he laid his right
[2:25:41] hand upon me saying unto me fear
[2:25:44] not I am the first and the
[2:25:47] last I am he that liveth was dead and
[2:25:51] behold I am alive forever more amen and
[2:25:55] have the keys of hell and death I just
[2:26:00] want to point out one more thing in
[2:26:02] these two verses all that we have
[2:26:07] discussed in this
[2:26:10] sermon three times in these two verses
[2:26:13] are the phrase I
[2:26:17] am I am the the first and the

[2:26:31] liveth and was
[2:26:34] dead he was dead but he is currently
[2:26:39] living and then he says I am alive
[2:26:44] forever more that's who he is he is
[2:26:48] alive for all forever more and he is
[2:26:52] giving us he has given us it is current
[2:26:57] it is active energizing alive he has
[2:27:01] given to us all of his all of his being
[2:27:07] that we read in chapter one that
[2:27:10] transfers to chapter 2 a bit for each
[2:27:13] Church age but if all of the evil
[2:27:15] culminates in this age the overcoming
[2:27:19] power culminates Ates in this age and
[2:27:21] the only way friends that we'll ever
[2:27:24] overcome all of the spirits of all of
[2:27:27] the other age is for us to have all of

[2:27:37] is current he is alive he is active and
