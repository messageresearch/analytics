TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] Wow. [Music] Praise the Lord. I'm Pastor Stephen Shelley and you're watching The Eagles Cry. I am so happy to have you tuned in this week to this program. And I pray that something will be said that will be a blessing to you on your spiritual journey as you pursue a deep relationship with the living God. Yes, it's possible. It's not only possible, it's probable. In fact, it's positive. If you will pursue him, if you'll reach out for him, if you'll draw near to him, he will draw near to you. In fact, you could not even draw near to God or have the desire to draw near to him unless he releases that to you. Now, that's heavy, isn't it? But that's what the scripture teaches. When we have a hunger for God, it's because he's released to us the grace to have hunger for him. The deep calleth to the deep. There is something in the depth of your spirit, man, that longs to be restored to the fellowship that Adam had in the Garden of Eden. I hear a lot of people say we're going back to the book of Acts. And we are. We're going back to where there's going to be a body of believers in the earth who operate in the fullness of the spirit like the the apostles did like we read about in the book of the acts of the apostles is often called. But we believe it's really the acts of the holy spirit in and through the apostles. And the reason why we specify that is because we believe that God wants to do the same thing in our day. I believe there is a move of God that's breaking forth in the earth right now. We used to say it's coming. It's coming. It's coming. It's up the road one of these days, some golden day break. But I have good news for you. I believe that God is breaking through. I believe that God is rending the heavens. I believe that he's coming down with power, with authority, with healing in his hands. I believe that we are about to see a real transition in the body of Christ. Now, I don't know what's going to go on in the church because many of our churches are going to uh probably continue to pursue dead, lifeless religion. But there's a body of people that are planted in churches all over the world. And if their church is not going to pursue God, they're going to pursue him anyway because they're being called. They're being wooed. They're being drawn by the spirit of God. I am excited today. I'm excited about our study and we're going to get right into that in just a moment. But I want to invite you to visit our ministry website on the worldwide web at revival.org. All of our contact information is given to you on the screen. I'm trying not to spend as much of our 30 minutes inviting you to contact us, but I really want you to. I just don't want to spend so much time asking you. I want to spend as much time in the word as we possibly can. But for more information about our ministry, the best place to get it is on our ministry website. We want to go right into the word of God. And as we do, let me remind you, if you have any prayer requests that you'd like for us to join our faith with your faith and believe God for your miracle, this is a day of miracles. We're seeing miracles take place around the world. The dead are being raised. The lame are walking. The blind are seeing. The deaf are hearing. And I believe that we are well within our rights to say that Bible days are here again. Right now, the present situation is there are pockets of outpouring. There are tokens of places where renewal is taking place, leaning toward a move of God or what we would call a revival. And God's lighting fires. He's just lighting Holy Ghost bonfires. one here, one there, one over yonder. And the great thing about it is they're going to begin to spread. And when they do, they're going to touch each other. And when those fires that God has lit here, there, and somewhere else, when they begin to touch each other, there's going to be a blanket. There's going to be a blanket of fire. And we're going to see transition take place in neighborhoods and communities, in cities and regions, and states, and in nations. In nations. and are all going to be a part of it. No. I'm telling you right now, every man, woman, boy, or girl will not reach out and embrace it. But there are people who were absolutely, the scripture tells us, predestinated, chosen in Christ, who are going to begin to feel that overwhelming hunger for God. I mean, there are people right now who are uh sitting on a bar stool. There are people who are strung out on drugs, who are as far away from God seemingly as anybody could be. But in a moment, in a in a suddenly what we call a suddenly in a in a very instantaneous release of grace, people are going to come to themselves like the prodigal in the pig pin and they're going to they're going to think all of a sudden they're going to have a reality all of a sudden, what am I doing here? I need to be hungry. I need to be moving toward the kingdom of God. You really believe that? I do. I do. I believe people are going to wake up in the gutter and realize all of a sudden that the thing that they have fought against and run from is their destiny. And when they do, they're going to come looking for somebody who has life, who has power, who has authority in the spirit. They're not going to find that in dead, dry, cold, formal religion, but they're going to find it in a company of people that are being empowered by the Holy Spirit in these last days. a company of overcomers. Those who will not be overcome by evil, but those who will overcome evil with good, with the goodness of the living God. I'm excited. I am excited. Let's look to the scripture today. All right. We've been studying how, well, I should say, I was going to say we've been studying how to exercise our spiritual senses, but we're really laying a foundation to get to that message. We're coming to it. We're just laying a biblical foundation, doing some teaching. We've talked about how that which is born of the flesh is flesh. That which is born of the spirit is spirit. We've looked at some scriptures uh about Adam in the garden. We'll look at that again real quickly. Just kind of refresh your memory in Genesis chapter 1 and verse 27. So God created man in his own image. In the image of God created he him. male and female created he them. And then in Genesis 2:7, and the Lord God formed man out of the dust of the ground. And that dust we talked about last time we were together. The dust particles speaks of dependency. That man would forever be dependent upon his creator. and breathed, listen, he formed man out of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul. Actually, he not only became a living soul but through this breath, the very spirit of God, part of the triune of God, triune nature of God, father, son, holy spirit, his very spirit, his very life was moved. It was breathed. It was transferred into Adam and he became alive. Otherwise, he would have been just a a clump of dust that had been put together. And we talked about that. We talked about this is how Adam was made. You and I were uh in he was in the image of God. We are in the image of Adam. We have been formed. He was our father, so to speak, in the things of of this at least in this earthly realm. Now, Adam had a very supernatural ability to communicate with God. how spirit to spirit he lost that ability through the fall through the sin of the garden of Eden. He lost that ability when Jesus Christ came. Yeshua the Messiah our the second Adam the apostle calls him in the New Testament. He potentially released that regeneration. He he released regeneration for the spirit of man. So when we become born again, our spirit man becomes renewed or regenerated or made alive, quickened, transformed. But the problem is we spend more time exercising the flesh and and the realm of the soul. And the realm of the soul, how how our flesh has communication with the earth is through our five senses. And again, there's a few more than five, but we usually hear more commonly seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and through touch or through feeling. This is how the body, our flesh, communicates with our earthly surroundings. Then the soul of man and some of that information that is gathered by these senses of our flesh filters into the soul. And and it's very easy to remember uh the doorways into the soul of man. If you use this little thing that a dear brother, a dear friend of mine, he said you you spell out my car. my car. But instead of spelling it my y, you spell it m i. My car. C A R. And you'll get them. The M is for memories. One of the ways that the enemy uses to access the soul of man is through memories. We have good memories, thank God, but we also have bad memories. And if the enemy can stir up those bad memories, it affects our soul. And what affects our soul goes both ways. What do you mean by that? What what is going on in our soul affects our body and what's going on in our soul affects our spirit. So, we've got to be careful. We've got to get some regeneration going on in our memories. We've got to ask God to cut us off from some memories that the enemy would try to use. I for the my is imagination. We all have imagination. We don't want to curse imagination. It's a gift of God. We don't want to kill it. It's God's gift. We want to sanctify it. We want to sanctify our memories. Set them apart. Good memories. We want to sanctify our imagination. We do that through prayer, through soaking in the presence of God, through studying God's word. And then conscience. Uh our conscience is a God-given gift. It's a doorway into our soul. But our conscience needs to be sanctified because the Bible says you can do something and do something against God, sin against God, fail God over and over again until your conscience becomes seared like a hot iron so that it no longer functions in the way that God intended for it to function. A lot of people say, "Well, I live by my conscience." You better live by the pricking of the Holy Spirit, by the conviction of the Holy Spirit. Because if you're not positive that your conscience is completely renewed and and regenerated by the spirit of God, uh then it could be seared. It could be that you have sinned against God and sinned against God or failed numerous times in an area until your conscience has caused your soul to become numb. And so you continue to do it and no longer feel guilty. I'll give you a good example. People are all all the time watching Hollywood movies. And uh I think you should be careful with that. I do. I'm not against movies. I'm not against uh uh family entertainment. I'm not against that at all. But I'll tell you what happens when you start watching a lot of movies. The first time you hear a curse word, a swear word, you flinch. if that's not a part of who you are and I want you to know that's not a part of who I am. I don't use that kind of language. And I don't like to hear that kind of language. And but sometimes if you've really got something interesting you want to see, you you really believe there's a storyline and they've thrown that stuff in because that's the way Hollywood does. You press through and every time you hear an ugly word, oh, it gets you. You feel it. It affects you. But if you keep doing it, if you if you don't filter that out, and there are tools and ways of filtering that out, or if you don't become more selective in what you watch and what you feed your soul on, then I guarantee you there will come a time that you will hear those words and feel nothing. You will feel nothing. And not only will you not feel uh some conviction or some uh you know tensing up when you hear language uh even using God's name in vain that disturbs you now. But if you continue to feed on that kind of language uh watch those movies where God's name is profained over and over again. There will come a time I want to say again I guarantee you there will come a time that you will hear that and not be convicted not feel anything at all. In fact, you will justify it. You'll come to a place where you say, "Well, that's not how I talk and it's a very good movie and so forth." So, I'm telling you, our conscience needs to be sanctified. It needs to be touched by the spirit of God and it can't be totally trusted because it can be seared with a hot iron. So, you've got memories, you've got imagination, you've got conscience. That's for the C. A is affections. The Bible tells us where we need to set our affection. We need to set our affection on things above. I do not believe that that uh our uh well, you know, I don't know how to say this so that it comes across in in the right balance. Sometimes people say, well, he or she is so heavenly minded, they're no earthly good. Well, I believe that's exactly where we're going in the spirit realm. I believe God wants us to become very, very heavenly minded. I believe God wants us to walk in the spirit, live in the spirit and function in the spirit. But until we sanctify ourselves even in the realm of the flesh and in the realm of the soul, we are not coming yet to that place where we can truly live out of the spirit. So what people usually mean by that is someone has become so religious. That's usually you call it heavenly-minded, but what it often means is someone has become quite religious and they're not they're not functioning the way they should. Uh people set their affection on all kinds of things. Like I said a moment ago, entertainment uh love story books or magazines or whatever. And I believe that that moderation is necessary in all things. Uh I definitely believe in modesty. I definitely believe in moderation. I I believe that there are there should be uh a limit to how much time we spend in our life with entertainment. I believe we should try to limit put some kind of restriction because otherwise we're going to build up the flesh. We're going to exercise the flesh. We're going to exercise the soul and our spirit is going to shrink away to nearly nothing. We feed the flesh. We feed the soul. We need to start being concerned about nourishing the spirit man. And that's part of what this study is about. So be careful what you set your affections on because what you set your affections on feeds the soul. So, we've got want to get it again. We've got memory, we've got imagination, we've got conscience, we've got affections, and then we've got reasonings. These are the doorways into the soul of man. Reasonings. And part of that is the emotion also and the will uh going into the soul. But reasonings and and a lot of our reasonings come from emotion. And we start trying to reason things out in our mind. Well, such and such, but if I did so and so, and that couldn't really be sin, and well, uh, that's just what somebody said, and everybody else is doing it. And we just start reasoning things out. And that's okay if you're reasoning out your own, uh, salvation. The Bible does say we should work out our own salvation with fear and trembling, not with human reasoning. With fear and trembling. We want to work out our salvation by by using the absolute pattern for life, the word of God. I hope I haven't lost you. I hope you're still with me in this teaching. We've been given a road map. We've been given a pattern of how we should live our lives. And so again, I'm going to say these again. I I want you to get them. I want you to try to understand them. uh the enemy uh is out there and he wants to penetrate not just your flesh but also your soul. So let's just review a moment. How does our body contact or have communication with its earthly environment? Through the senses primarily five seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and feeling. How does the soul communicate? The soul is kind of an interesting thing because the soul can communicate with both the earthly realm and have communication also with the heavenly realm. The soul is in the middle and it has communication with both realms. How does this happen? How what are the doorways? We could say what are the gateways into our soul? Well, we know emotion and will is a very important part of that. We hear that in teaching all the time. But I I really believe there is a truth here to this uh my car memories, imagination, conscience, affection and reasonings. These are the ways, the doorways, the entrances into the soul of man. What comes into the soul affects the spirit. It affects the spirit. So, what we've got is we've got this big old fat soul that's been fed and overstimulated by the surroundings of this life. And we've got this tiny little spirit man. I had a dream one time about a stick figure and a sumo wrestler. And I could not understand what the dream meant. And one day I heard some very good teaching on on the spirit of man, nourishing the spirit of man. And guess what? The example the teacher used was the sumo wrestler and a tiny little stick man. And the sumo wrestler represents a soul because it gets fed. It gets stimulated. We've got imagination, memories, affections, reasonings, all this stuff coming in all the time. It gets big, big, big. Uh what we uh receive through the five senses into our flesh that also feeds the soul. So you've got all this seeing and hearing and and the bad reports and seeing things we shouldn't see perhaps and all this. So the soul's just getting fat fat fat and the spirit is this little stick man. We want to reverse the order. We want to exercise the senses of our spirit man so that the spirit man becomes like the big sumo wrestler and our soul is not listen you don't want to kill your soul. I hear people talking about I I've got to crucify my soul. I've got a That's your flesh. You're trying to The Bible talks about daily crucifying the flesh. Your soul is not your enemy. In fact, your flesh is not your enemy. The The devil is your enemy. He's the one that wants to penetrate your life through your flesh and through the realm of your soul. You don't want to kill your soul. Your soul is not your enemy. You want it to be sanctified. You want it to be set apart. How does that happen? Well, by reading God's word, by understanding the truth of God's word, by worshiping in the realm of the spirit, by soaking in the presence of God, by filling your soul with the good things of the Lord, by keeping good company, by keeping good company, by reordering your affections. What are you setting your affections on? By sanctifying your imagination. all of these things, you'll bring your soul into its proper place. You're not to live your Christian life ruled by your soul. If you do that, your imagination will rule you. Your conscience will rule you. Your affections, your reasonings will rule your life. You're you are to live your life your spirit man, Jesus Christ, the the the spirit of God is to sit on the throne of your spirit and rule out from the inside of the inside out. The spirit is to have uh some dominion, some leadership over the soul and over the flesh. Now, I've just said a mouthful. I hope that you can think about it. Uh I hope you can digest it. Perhaps you would even want to uh order this series. We're not here trying to sell you something, but you might want to order this series. You might want to go back and see it again. We perhaps can make it available in audio as well. You might want to go back and follow this thing through because I really believe that there are some keys in this uh body, soul, spirit teaching, how to exercise the senses of the spirit. I believe there's some keys in this that God wants to use to unlock some realms of the spirit so that you and I will begin to live like he wants us to live. Not just back to the book of Acts, as we started to say a moment ago. God wants us to go all the way back to the Garden of Eden. Hallelujah. He wants us to have that place of communion and fellowship with God that Adam had in the cool of the day. Again, a pop quiz here. How did Adam communicate with his creator? How? through his flesh, through his only his soul. No, spirit to spirit, deep to deep, spirit to spirit. This is how the communication was. Are Christians communicating with God spirit to spirit today? Yes, he's opening up that realm. He's opening up that realm. There's good teaching. There's anointed impartation that's taking place. And God is opening up that realm. But we're not there yet where we want to be. We're not into that place of full oneness and intimacy a and uh relationship. We're we're going there. We're headed there. We're moving in the right direction. The door is open and it is going on, but not to the degree that I believe God wants it to uh to be, but we're headed in that direction. So you can start praying in your own life that God will help you to live your life not governed by your flesh, not even governed by your soul, but governed by your spirit and not your human spirit, but your human spirit that has been regenerated and surrendered to the Lord Jesus Christ and he's sitting on the throne and he's ruling. I tell you that is good. It's good and it works and I want it. I don't want just a piece of it. I want the fullness of it. And so where are we? There's a lot here. We're growing now uh by the born again experience. Our human spirit that was lost because of the fall in the Garden of Eden. It has been regenerated and renewed. It has been restored. But it must be developed. Our human spirit must be developed. It must be exercised. It must be the sumo wrestler and the soul must shrink into its proper place. Now this happens again. I think I've said already how it happens. How do we get in proper alignment? How do we come into divine alignment? We do that by feeding on God's word. By worshiping him in spirit and in truth. You don't have to be in church to worship. Worship is a lifestyle. Worship is a lifestyle we could live. We must live a life of worship. That which brings glory and honor to God. Soaking in his presence, filling our lives with good sound Bible teaching with revelation. Not just knowledge, with revelation. Get under a teacher. Get into a ministry. Get some resources of men and women that have been with God. been with God, been in in the presence of the Lord, uh called into the throne room, have had heavenly experiences that are biblically sound. Now, just remember that any uh heavenly experience, vision, dream, gift with say for instance, tongues, message of tongues, prophecy, interpretation. I believe that all of those things must be grounded in God's word. grounded in God's word. And I believe we can do that if it's truly from God. I believe we can ground the experience in the word. So our spirit, let's go back. Our spirit has been renewed. It has been restored. It has been regenerated because of the price that Jesus paid on Calvary. So we're part of the way back already. When we become born again, we're part of the way back to the relationship that Adam had with his creator in the beginning. We're part of the way back. Potentially, we're there. But there is some development that must take place. There is something that must be developed, exercised, strengthened. We've got to get used to. Listen, we've lived our lives in the realm of the flesh and in the realm of the soul for so long that we don't know how to live with our spirit at the steering wheel. Again, not our just our human spirit, but the Holy Spirit that has taken over leadership of our spirit. We've surrendered. We've become one with him. That's what we're after. We don't even know how really to live that kind of a life, but we're going to be taught and it's going to be supernatural. And that's beginning right now. We're growing in spiritual maturity. Now, the next time we meet together, I'm going to give you scriptures because there's there is undoubtedly going to be somebody who says, "Well, I don't I don't believe you have to grow into that. I don't believe you're developed in that. When you get saved, you get it all. Well, that would be good. That would be wonderful. You're right, though. The price that Christ paid, the price that Jesus paid at Calvary has potentially made everything we need available to us. Absolutely, you are right. But we don't get it all, so to speak, just because we we uh repeat the sinner's prayer and join the church and and start our Christian journey. This is a journey of development. Revelation is progressive. We grow in grace. We grow in truth. We grow in strength. We grow in glory. That's why the Bible said from glory to glory. Another place from strength to strength. Another place from faith to faith. We're growing. We're developing. And I'm going to give you some scriptures the next time we meet together about this progress. How we progress. How we develop. how we move to that place where we are in oneness with the Lord, divine alignment. His spirit has uh taken uh complete charge of our lives and we just live out from the realm of the spirit. Oh, I'm looking forward to that. I'm after that. I'm chasing that. Let's pray right now. Father, I thank you for every listener, for every viewer. I pray right now that you will let revelation knowledge flow. That you will speak to hearts and lives. That you will let these truths drop from our head to our heart. That you will let us walk them out. Father, I pray for the sick right now in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Yeshua, I release healing to whatever the sickness, whatever the infirmity is. Yes, Lord. I believe you are still a healer today. And I ask you to manifest your healing touch. I feel that. I feel that right now that you're getting a hold of this. You're going to let your faith reach out and touch the Lord. Somebody is receiving some healing into their body. Even perhaps a miracle. If you need a miracle, he is a miracle worker. Father, I just thank you for doing that right now. In the wonderful name of Yeshua, the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Well, I'm talking fast. 90 miles a minute. So that lets you know I'm feeling the anointing of the Lord. I'm excited about what God's saying to us. I'm excited about you and your desire to understand to unlock these scriptural and spiritual truths. And I bless you on your journey. I bless your spirit and I pray that it will come to the place of development and fullness and completeness in the Lord Jesus Christ. God richly bless you. Thank you for watching The Eagles Cry and please tune in again next time. Bye-bye for now. [Music] [Music]
