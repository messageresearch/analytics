========================================

Description:
We don’t grow in Christ when we blame someone else for our situation, if we are continue to nurse  bitterness, unforgiveness or woundedness.  A loving God wants to give us victory over every stressful situation in life, if we can come to a place of worship as David did, when we constantly express the overwhelming goodness of God.  “Lord, You are so faithful, You are so good to me…”

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the Bible talks about a a situation where our private words could be shouted from the Housetop there's no hiding place so it behooves us as Believers to continually examine our thoughts and our words but understand that he knows and he understands he's not standing with a sledgehammer waiting to crush your skull when you think something you shouldn't think or say something you shouldn't say he didn't come to the Garden of Eden to destroy Adam and Eve he came to cover their nakedness and their nakedness was a result of their rebellious sin is that right it was reasoning that caused the problem in the first place and remember what that reasoning was about it was to place a seed of discrepancy and doubt in Eve's mind that God is ultimately good want you to understand tonight is a part of the bride of Christ that God father your papa your ABBA is ultimately good and he is out to help you to bless you to strengthen you to prosper you we only get in trouble when we walk against his will when we live against his word but the Blessed Place The Sweet Spot in life is walking in obedience to his word and taking advantage of the grace that he gives us to sanctify our thoughts and to arrest and control the words that come out of our mouth I don't believe that words just spill out of their own accord or out of our imagination I believe what the scripture said you can say I didn't mean it you can say I don't mean it but the Bible tells us that what's in the heart is bound to come out out of the abundance of the heart if the heart is filled with hate or bitterness or anger or hurt or woundedness then what what fills our heart is going to spill out of our mouth and we can't exactly say that we don't mean it if we've been nursing that bitterness if we've been nurturing that unforgiveness if we've been petting the wound instead of allowing the Holy Spirit to scrape the scab and pour in the healing bomb and the Salve you're not growing in Christ if you're blaming somebody else you're not growing in Christ if you're blaming somebody else for your situation we are not a bunch of Puppets life is not snatching us around or controlling us there's a loving God who wants to give us victory over every stressful situation in our life and if we can learn the place of worship that David did by by constantly expressing the overwhelming goodness of God you're so good God you are so good you're so good to me you are so faithful to me foreign
