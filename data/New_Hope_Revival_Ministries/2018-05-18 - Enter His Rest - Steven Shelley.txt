TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you can't just have faith that the promises of God are yes a man for someone else if you do then unbelief will keep you from entering into the fullness of what Christ has made available for you and I in this hour to be partakers of him means that we receive the benefit of being a part of him of being connected to him participating with him in the plan of redemption and the enemy doesn't want that he doesn't want that he wants you and I wavering in unbelief the the enemy is actually less challenged by your faith for someone else he is more challenged by what faith you have for your own life to believe that these promises of God are for you I'm going to mix join my faith with God's Word and I'm going to hold on it kills unbelief your faith attached to God's Word kills unbelief it drives it right out of your life and why is getting rid of unbelief so important because unbelief can keep you out of rest when I'm talking about spiritual rest I mean confidence and trust that I'm covered by the blood he loves me he has chosen me he wants to be a part of my life in fact he wants to be my life he wants to be the center of my life and why wouldn't I want him to be because the more I allow him to be lord over my life I'm telling you the grater against the greater the relationship grows if you and I are willing to put our faith into action joining it with the Word of God then the full effectiveness of the word becomes our inheritance everything God promised to do he will do for us the Lord is inviting us to have something more than just Christianity light he wants us to understand what it means to be filled with the very life of God and to enter into that place of rest where the works the good works that we do we do them out of love we do them because we want to serve him not because we want to earn his favor [Music]
