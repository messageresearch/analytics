TRANSCRIPT
========================================
i was standing on a mountain looking toward the sky and i saw a storm approaching and i feared that i would die i saw god's creatures run and see a better place to hide heard the thunder [Music] now the clouds were moving faster lightning flashing bright clouds so dark they hit the sun and it seemed that it was night when all at once there was a feeling like i never had before above the storm you should have heard me say god has given me [Music] so spread your wings [Music] you weren't born for the valley you [Music] with [Music] all at once the spear it lifted me high above it all [Music] and i never even had to move my wings the holy spirit had control i was soaring high above my circumstances my confusion and all my pain though i've spent many years in the old barnyard i was always an eagle by his name so [Music] you weren't born to live in the valley you were born to live in the sky don't let your trials ever get you down or drive your spirit to the ground [Music] spread your wings little [Music] now don't you ever let your child get you down or drive your spirit low to the ground up [Music] [Applause] [Music] little [Music] grace you
