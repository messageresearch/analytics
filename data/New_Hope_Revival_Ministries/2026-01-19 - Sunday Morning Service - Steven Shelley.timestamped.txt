[4:00] Heat.
[4:15] Heat.
[4:22] Heat. Heat.
[4:59] I heard an old old story.
[5:04] How a savior came from glory.
[5:08] how he gave his life on Calvary
[5:13] to save a wretch like me.
[5:17] I heard about his groaning
[5:21] of his precious blood atoning.
[5:26] Then I repented of my sins and won the
[5:32] victory.
[5:35] Victory
[5:37] in Jesus, my savior
[5:42] forever.
[5:44] Well, he sought me and he bought me with
[5:49] his redeeming blood.
[5:52] He loved me.
[5:55] I knew him and all my love is to him. He
[6:02] punched me to victory
[6:06] beneath the cleansing.
[6:10] I heard about his healing of his
[6:15] cleansing power, revealing
[6:19] how he made the lame to walk again. And
[6:24] he caused the blind to see.
[6:28] And then I cried, "Dear Jesus, come and
[6:33] heal my broken
[6:35] spirit."
[6:37] And somehow Jesus came and brought to me
[6:42] the victory.
[6:45] Well, victory
[6:48] in Jesus
[6:50] my savior
[6:52] forever.
[6:54] Well, he sought me and he bought me with
[6:59] his redeeing blood. Oh, he loved me. I
[7:06] knew him and all my love. It is through
[7:11] him. He punched me to victory
[7:17] beneath the cleansing blood.
[7:21] I heard about that mansion he has built
[7:26] for me in glory.
[7:29] And I heard about the streets of gold
[7:34] just beyond the crystal sea.
[7:38] And about the angels
[7:41] singing and that old redemption
[7:45] story. You know, in some sweet day I'll
[7:49] sing up there that song of victory.
[7:55] Well, victory
[7:58] in Jesus, my savior
[8:02] forever.
[8:04] He sought me and he bought me with his
[8:10] redeeing blood. Oh, he loved me and I
[8:16] knew him. And all my love is through
[8:20] him. He punched me to victory
[8:26] beneath the cleansing flood.

[8:35] built for me in glory.
[8:39] And I heard about those streets of gold
[8:43] just beyond the crystal sea
[8:47] and about the angels
[8:50] singing and that old redemption
[8:55] story. You know in some sweet day I'll

[36:02] &gt;&gt; on clouds like stallions he'll descend.
[36:09] The trumpet starts to blaze and the
[36:12] saints erupt in praise. The king is
[36:17] coming back again.
[36:21] Yeah. And our king is coming back again.
[36:27] Oh hallelu.

[38:18] because you are worthy.
[38:21] You are worthy of praise and adoration
[38:25] and we give it to you today, Lord.
[38:30] Wonderful King of glory,
[38:33] blessed redeemer,
[38:35] the one who picked us up out of where we
[38:38] were and you set us above it.
[38:44] I thank you, Lord. I thank you, Lord.
[38:51] We give you our heart.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; Everything that we are, Lord,
[38:57] &gt;&gt; any of those places that we have not
[39:00] allowed you into,
[39:05] we give it to you today,
[39:09] Lord. We open up everything that we are
[39:11] to you. We don't want to hold back one
[39:15] little thing.
[39:17] Not one thing, Lord.
[39:21] We belong to you in totality.
[39:25] Great is your goodness and faithfulness
[39:27] to us.
[39:30] Hallelujah.
[39:32] Hallelujah.
[39:34] Thank you, Lord.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[39:42] As we're getting ready to pray today,
[39:44] would you have a need by the lifting of
[39:46] the hand? You just want to lift it to
[39:47] the Lord. Say, "I have a need." Out
[39:51] across the stream,
[39:53] the Lord sees your need. Though we may
[39:56] not be able to see your hand, our Lord
[39:59] sees it. He sees your need and he knows
[40:02] how to answer that need. Let's continue
[40:04] to remember brother Paul Drowned to the
[40:07] Lord that God will give him a healing
[40:09] miracle. Sister Audrey Lewis that the
[40:12] Lord will continue his work and heal her
[40:15] body. Brother Man's uncle is very low.
[40:19] He'd like to be remembered to the Lord
[40:22] in prayer. And Sister Man's dad is in
[40:24] the hospital and he also needs a mighty
[40:26] touch.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; Jacob reached out because he's on shift
[40:30] today and Hope was unsure about the road
[40:34] up that way and we want to lift them up
[40:36] to the Lord. Stephen and Lydia have
[40:39] traveled home to Indiana. So, we want to
[40:42] hold on to them. And I know many of you
[40:44] were blessed Tuesday night like I was.
[40:47] And we want to pray for our brother Josh
[40:51] and and Kayla and those beautiful
[40:53] children that they have that everywhere
[40:56] they go between now and the end of
[40:57] February that God will anoint the
[41:00] givers.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah. and that every need that they have
[41:02] for their next uh run on the field would
[41:06] be supplied and that God would give them
[41:08] souls.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; I I believe the Lord would honor and
[41:13] bless us if we would remember to hold
[41:15] them up to him in prayer and uh I should
[41:18] have some good news from Jerusalem in
[41:21] the next few days it looks like. So
[41:23] let's please keep praying for that.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[41:28] Let's take these needs to the Lord
[41:30] today. Hey, will you sing this little
[41:32] song as we're preparing?
[41:35] It is so sweet
[41:38] to trust in Jesus.
[41:43] just to take
[41:47] him at his word.
[41:51] Just to rest
[41:54] upon his promise,
[41:59] just to know
[42:02] the saith the Lord
[42:06] Jesus.
[42:08] Jesus.
[42:10] How I trust him. How I've proved him
[42:17] more and more.
[42:21] Jesus.
[42:23] Jesus.
[42:25] Precious
[42:27] Jesus.
[42:28] Oh, for grace.
[42:32] Sing of course again. Nathan, will you
[42:34] come and pray, please? Jesus.
[42:37] Jesus.
[42:39] How I trust him. How I prove him more
[42:48] and more.
[42:50] Jesus.
[42:52] Jesus.
[42:54] Precious
[42:56] Jesus.
[42:58] Oh
[43:01] to trust him more.
[43:05] Let's pray. Yes.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Father in heaven, we love you.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; We thank you, Lord, that you have given
[43:10] us another opportunity to come together
[43:13] with these saints of like precious
[43:14] faith, this family of God, to gather in
[43:18] your name, oh God, to be in your
[43:21] presence as a family.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; Lord, we thank you that you've come in
[43:25] this house, oh Lord. Thank you, Lord,
[43:27] that you are answering needs as the
[43:30] service goes on. That you're answering
[43:32] questions that are before you, oh Lord.
[43:35] that you're touching sick bodies, oh
[43:37] God. Lifting up those who are down.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; We thank you for it, Lord. For each need
[43:43] that was called aloud and for each need
[43:46] that's represented here that's held in
[43:48] our heart. There are so many, Lord.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; We have so much on our heart and in our
[43:53] mind because the days are growing short.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; But Lord, I believe that you are the
[44:00] answer. Lord, every sick body, every
[44:03] sick mind,
[44:05] &gt;&gt; every financial need,
[44:10] &gt;&gt; every need of the heart, oh God,
[44:13] &gt;&gt; for everyone who came in here today with
[44:15] a need before you, with a question that
[44:18] they want answered,
[44:22] &gt;&gt; those that are hungry for you,
[44:24] &gt;&gt; I ask, oh Lord, that you would move in
[44:26] each case.
[44:29] Oh God, you said, "Blessed be the
[44:31] hungry, for they shall be filled."
[44:35] And Lord, I'm seeking for an answer from
[44:37] you.
[44:40] I ask Lord for the hails as they travel
[44:44] that you would be with them, oh Lord,
[44:46] and that you would give them safety on
[44:48] the roadways. And Lord, that you would
[44:50] continue to speak to them and draw them.
[44:52] Oh God,
[44:54] &gt;&gt; that what they do would be
[44:59] eternal. Oh God,
[45:01] &gt;&gt; what you're doing in them is eternal.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Lord, as we sit under the word today,
[45:06] speak to our hearts. Be with our pastor
[45:08] as he speaks, oh God.
[45:11] Anoint his lips, oh God, that he would
[45:13] speak directly to each one of us. said,
[45:15] "May our ears be attentive to hear what
[45:18] you would have to say today. Oh God, we
[45:20] thank you for all these things in the
[45:22] name of Jesus Christ." Amen.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:30] We give you praise, Lord.
[45:33] We give you praise for you're worthy.
[45:38] Hallelujah.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. You may have your seats
[45:43] today.
[45:46] What a blessing it is to be gathered in
[45:48] the house of the Lord together with you.
[45:50] All of you out across the stream. We're
[45:52] glad that you have joined us in this
[45:55] service by way of the stream. It's a
[45:58] whole lot better inside here all
[46:00] gathered together, but sometimes it
[46:02] doesn't work out that you can be here. I
[46:04] pray the presence of the Lord will go
[46:06] over that camera and minister to you the
[46:08] way that he does to us here. Sister
[46:10] Naomi, it's sure glad to see you here.
[46:13] We're glad to see you here in the house
[46:14] of the Lord today. God bless you,
[46:19] Sister Sarah Robson. It's good to have
[46:21] you and the children. Johnny, we're glad
[46:23] that you're here today.
[46:29] Joshua has a co-orker with him there.
[46:31] Jordan, we're glad that you're here with
[46:33] us today. The Lord bless you.
[46:39] So thankful for the presence of the Lord
[46:41] in the house. thankful that he is here
[46:44] working among us and doing in us what we
[46:48] can't do for ourselves.
[46:50] If we can get ourselves in a place where
[46:53] that we surrender as he is uh coming
[46:58] among us while we're worshiping him, he
[47:01] can do more
[47:02] &gt;&gt; in a split second
[47:09] &gt;&gt; than all of our years of striving. So
[47:12] true.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; I'm glad for the presence of the Lord.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Kate is going to get ready to
[47:20] sing as we're worshiping together,
[47:24] getting ready for the preaching of the
[47:25] word. Joyce and I would like to thank
[47:28] you for welcoming her niece and family,
[47:32] Josh and Kayla Hail, and how generous
[47:35] that you were to them. The Lord bless
[47:37] you and thank you so much for welcoming
[47:40] them and being generous to them to the
[47:42] work of the Lord that they're doing. Um
[47:46] Josh told me that there were some that
[47:48] wanted some of those little cards that
[47:50] you would remember to pray for them. I
[47:52] laid them on that little sideboard table
[47:54] out there as you're going out the door.
[47:56] If you would like to have one, there are
[47:58] more of them back there. Uh we're going
[48:01] to receive the tithe and offering giving
[48:03] to the work of the Lord. giving to what
[48:06] the Lord has called us to to see the
[48:08] purposes of God fulfilled
[48:11] uh in in this house and on this ground.
[48:14] What he has called us to in the end
[48:16] time. We give of our tithe and offering
[48:19] gladly to him and we're thankful that he
[48:22] has blessed us to be able to give. He is
[48:26] the one who supplies everything that we
[48:28] have. It is because of him that we live
[48:31] and move and even have breath in our
[48:34] body. And he gives us the strength to
[48:37] labor with our hands. He gives us the
[48:39] strength to carry on from day to day. If
[48:42] you're retired, he gave you the strength
[48:44] in time past. And he continues to look
[48:47] after you. You know, I don't think there
[48:49] are any of us here today that are
[48:51] starving. I don't think there are any of
[48:53] us here that are destitute. God supplies
[48:56] all of our need. And I am thankful for
[48:59] that. Brother Elas, will you and uh
[49:01] Brother Austin Yantis go to the people
[49:03] today as we're worshiping together in
[49:06] our giving and we lift our voices to
[49:09] worship with brother Cade as we're
[49:10] getting ready for the preaching of the
[49:12] word.
[49:36] Somebody here
[49:39] needs an answer
[49:44] to the questions, the fears and the
[49:48] wise.
[49:50] Somebody here
[49:53] is desperate for freedom
[49:58] from the past and the chains and the
[50:02] lies.
[50:06] Feels like you wasted so much time.
[50:13] Want to move ahead, but you're still
[50:16] last in line. Feels
[50:20] like you're running will never end. And
[50:27] you will never win.
[50:34] Oh, but I don't know who told you you
[50:39] would not make it. And I don't know who
[50:43] told you you could not take it.
[50:48] And I don't know who told you it's time
[50:52] that you quit. Oh, but my God says wait,
[50:57] cuz it ain't over yet.
[51:05] Somebody here
[51:09] needs an answer
[51:13] to the questions and the fears and the
[51:17] wise.
[51:19] Somebody here
[51:22] is desperate for freedom
[51:26] from the past and the chains and the
[51:30] lies.
[51:34] Feels like you wasted so much time.
[51:41] Want to move ahead, but you're still
[51:44] lasting line.
[51:48] Feels like you're running will never
[51:52] end. And
[51:55] you will never win.
[52:02] But I don't know who told you you would
[52:06] not make it. And I don't know who told
[52:11] you you could not take it. And I don't
[52:16] know who told you it's time that you
[52:20] quit.
[52:22] But my God says wait cuz it ain't over
[52:26] yet.
[52:28] Oh,
[52:32] it ain't over till I say it's over. And
[52:38] I say that this thing.
[52:42] No, it ain't over yet.
[52:45] It ain't over till I say it's over. And
[52:51] I say that missing.
[52:56] It ain't over yet. Oh, hold on
[53:02] a little longer. Oh, cuz this thing
[53:08] know it ain't over yet. I don't know who
[53:12] told you you would not make it. And I
[53:18] don't know who told you you could not
[53:22] take it. And I don't know who told you
[53:27] it's time that you quit, but my God says
[53:32] wait, cuz it ain't over yet.
[53:38] Oh,
[53:40] and I don't know who told you you would
[53:44] not make it. And I don't know who told
[53:49] you you would not take it. And I don't
[53:54] know who told you it's time that you
[53:58] quit. But I've got a God that says,
[54:01] "Wait, it ain't over yet."
[54:07] Oh,
[54:09] it ain't over till I say it's over. And
[54:15] I say that this ain't
[54:19] it ain't over yet.
[54:22] It ain't over till I say it's over and I
[54:28] say that this
[54:32] it ain't over yet. Hold on
[54:38] a little longer.
[54:41] Cause this thing
[54:44] it ain't over yet. I don't know who told
[54:49] you you would not make it. And I don't
[54:54] know who told you you could not take it.
[55:00] And I don't know who told you it's time
[55:04] that you quit.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; You better stop this.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; God says, "Wait."
[55:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; It ain't over yet.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[55:17] My God says, "Wait, wait. It ain't over
[55:21] yet."
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Well, hallelujah.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad the devil doesn't get
[55:42] the last word?
[55:44] God gets the last word.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; Let's give God some praise. Come on.
[55:49] Wonderful Lord.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Wonderful Jesus.
[55:59] Good job.
[56:00] Hallelujah.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Isn't he good?
[56:05] &gt;&gt; You may be seated for just a moment. The
[56:07] victory is ours. It's already been won
[56:11] &gt;&gt; on our behalf. The lamb has won the
[56:14] victory. Praise God. We are here to
[56:17] appropriate the victory that the lamb
[56:19] has won on our behalf. And that is not a
[56:22] passive thing. That's an active thing.
[56:25] In fact, it's a daily thing. We have to
[56:28] put the blood of Jesus and the authority
[56:30] of the word into every situation that we
[56:34] face.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; If we miss one, we'll sink
[56:38] &gt;&gt; and we'll have to call out to him. Uh,
[56:41] and I'm thankful that if we do, he'll be
[56:43] there.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; But why would you want to maintain when
[56:46] you can you can grow and you can move
[56:48] higher in him?
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Well, we were blessed here Tuesday
[56:52] night. And uh we realized that our
[56:56] brother took a a bit of a a risk because
[57:00] he is not a part of uh the movement that
[57:04] we are in. If there if we are in a
[57:07] movement, I'm not sure. But uh anyway,
[57:10] we don't normally fellowship with the
[57:12] same folks, but uh he sort of represents
[57:16] our history, my history, and most
[57:19] specifically Sister Joyce's history. And
[57:22] it's did us pretty good. It did us quite
[57:25] well until we could get all the truth.
[57:28] But I wouldn't want to do anything that
[57:30] would uh I'm not going to be calling his
[57:32] name a lot over the pullpit. And uh I
[57:36] don't want to do anything that would
[57:37] jeopardize his ability to reach the
[57:40] community that God has sent him to.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; But we will continue to support him in
[57:44] prayer and in finances. If you so desire
[57:47] to do that, we will absolutely continue
[57:50] to do that because we believe that when
[57:52] the spirit of truth comes,
[57:55] &gt;&gt; he knows how to lead. He was telling me
[57:57] about a little girl in the community
[58:00] there that maybe she doesn't always
[58:02] dress like they would prefer for her to
[58:04] dress, but she's a poor girl and she
[58:06] hasn't had any kind of training except
[58:09] the example that they've been setting
[58:11] for her. and they found a little dress
[58:13] that they was a little longer than what
[58:15] she has has had and and uh they bought
[58:18] it for her at a at a thrift store,
[58:21] secondhand store
[58:23] so that she could wear it on Easter
[58:24] Sunday. And she was so proud of that
[58:28] dress. Nobody said, "Hey, here's a more
[58:30] appropriate dress." They just said,
[58:32] "Here's a dress for you to wear." And
[58:34] she was so proud of that dress and so
[58:37] thankful for it that when they got ready
[58:38] to leave, she she came up to him and she
[58:41] said, "Hey, where did you say you all
[58:43] got that dress?" She said, "I'm saving
[58:45] to get me some more." She said, "I like
[58:47] I like those I like those dresses. I
[58:50] like longer dresses." And he said, "I
[58:52] tell you what, you don't have to worry
[58:54] about nothing. When I come back, when we
[58:56] get back from the States, I guarantee
[58:59] you we'll have an armful of dresses for
[59:03] you." And he said, "We just let the Lord
[59:05] deal with her heart." And he was
[59:07] preparing her and we just did what he
[59:09] said and give her that little dress. And
[59:11] she immediately began to feel like that
[59:14] was more appropriate in life. You know,
[59:16] that's how the spirit of God works.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; A and after all, that's not the that's
[59:22] not the major point. That's not the main
[59:24] thing.
[59:26] Even brother Brandham rebukes us for
[59:28] majoring on minors.
[59:31] And uh modesty is essential when you
[59:34] have the truth. Uh you'll never find
[59:37] compromise uh with me on that. I believe
[59:40] in holiness and I believe in separation.
[59:43] But I believe that these things have to
[59:45] be the overflow of a changed heart.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; And that little girl's having her heart
[59:51] changed by love. Not by quotes.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; By love.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; And I I'm behind that 100%. Some of you
[1:00:00] have asked about our brother who's doing
[1:00:01] a work for the Lord in Israel. We also
[1:00:05] do not call his name uh because we want
[1:00:07] to protect his identity as much as we
[1:00:10] possibly can. He's sometimes in a
[1:00:12] dangerous place, in a dangerous
[1:00:13] position, but we pray that the Lord will
[1:00:16] continue to bless him. And there there
[1:00:18] have been through the years a few people
[1:00:20] who have paid their tithe on PayPal. And
[1:00:24] I don't encourage you to do that because
[1:00:25] the fees are a little bit higher than
[1:00:27] what we have through our online giving.
[1:00:30] But it has been convenient for a few
[1:00:32] people out of the country. And because
[1:00:35] of that, even though it's tithe, I've
[1:00:38] been not taking my portion of that. And
[1:00:40] uh when we could, we've been sending uh
[1:00:43] some uh usually $1,000 at a time to our
[1:00:48] brother in Israel for the work that he's
[1:00:50] doing. And the last time it was around
[1:00:52] Hanukkah time and he sent a note to say,
[1:00:56] "You will never know. You will never
[1:00:58] know how uh needed and appreciated it
[1:01:01] was. It came at a very very perfect
[1:01:03] time. Food in Israel is expensive and
[1:01:06] and uh utilities and things are
[1:01:09] expensive. So there are always those two
[1:01:12] opportunities before you if you want to
[1:01:14] sew into them. If you want to specify
[1:01:16] them uh in mission, you can just do
[1:01:18] that. just write missions and then if
[1:01:20] you want to specify it uh to uh to the
[1:01:24] name that was called in the prayer uh
[1:01:26] then we will do that or you could just
[1:01:28] say brother Josh and uh we'll know that
[1:01:31] it's not our brother Josh because he
[1:01:33] hadn't hit the mission field yet
[1:01:37] and it's not my Josh because he hasn't
[1:01:40] hit the mission field yet except for
[1:01:42] trips with dad but uh if they ever
[1:01:46] decide to go and spend their life that
[1:01:48] way we'll do our best to support them at
[1:01:50] that time. In the meantime, we'll
[1:01:52] support those who are there. Brother
[1:01:54] Brandham talks about uh if if you if you
[1:01:57] can go, it's a high calling to go. And
[1:02:00] if you can't go, you can send someone.
[1:02:04] And so, you got together. The first
[1:02:06] offering that we took here Tuesday night
[1:02:07] was only $500. And then someone had
[1:02:10] written a personal check directly to
[1:02:12] them for $500. I didn't know about the
[1:02:16] personal one at the time, but when they
[1:02:17] sent me the total, I said, "There's no
[1:02:20] way in the world." And it wasn't a real
[1:02:22] good time for us to just pull from
[1:02:25] somewhere else cuz I had been doing that
[1:02:27] all week long, pulling from somewhere
[1:02:29] else. And so, I just had that uncction.
[1:02:33] I hope you didn't feel pressured. Uh,
[1:02:36] but it worked if you did
[1:02:39] because I just felt an uncction to ask
[1:02:41] again. Would you, you've heard it now.
[1:02:43] you've heard the you've heard what
[1:02:45] they're doing. And you know, before they
[1:02:47] left here that night, uh there I think
[1:02:49] there was another $500 check perhaps
[1:02:52] that was given that was made directly to
[1:02:53] them. And the check was a the church was
[1:02:56] able to write them a check for $3,000.
[1:02:59] And I tell you, that's that's that makes
[1:03:02] me so happy and so proud of you.
[1:03:07] It wasn't in the budget,
[1:03:09] but you met the need for the evening,
[1:03:12] and I really appreciate you doing that.
[1:03:14] And I know that God will bless you. I
[1:03:17] know he will. Uh, let's stand. I When
[1:03:21] Cade sings like that, you know how I
[1:03:23] struggle because it makes me want to
[1:03:25] sing. But I'm going to pass it up this
[1:03:27] time. Let's thank God for these
[1:03:29] musicians.
[1:03:31] All they give, all they do.
[1:03:35] A few days ago, we weren't sure if if
[1:03:38] Benjamin was going to be able to be here
[1:03:40] today, and he's missed some from being
[1:03:42] in on the West Coast and and he he had a
[1:03:46] little sickness to hit him, but God
[1:03:48] really touched him. I'm so thankful for
[1:03:50] that. And it seems that most everybody
[1:03:52] is getting rid of their stuff and and uh
[1:03:55] let's be real careful. Now is the now is
[1:03:57] the is the important time.
[1:04:00] Now is the be careful time that you that
[1:04:03] you don't
[1:04:05] get it again or get somebody else's. So,
[1:04:08] uh maybe people get tired of hearing
[1:04:10] practical advice, but it's a good idea
[1:04:13] to keep your hands clean.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; And I know your mama told you, but you
[1:04:17] ignored her, so maybe you'll believe me.
[1:04:21] Uh you'd be surprised the difference
[1:04:23] that it will make. And even a nasal
[1:04:25] rinse or something like that will help
[1:04:27] you. And you might might laugh, but I
[1:04:30] Stacy makes me this little sav of of of
[1:04:33] uh of something and I just put it in the
[1:04:36] edges of my nose and I don't look pretty
[1:04:39] when I'm applying it, you know, but but
[1:04:41] uh you'd be surprised. It helps to form
[1:04:44] a barrier. And uh so we're we're serving
[1:04:47] a healer,
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; but he has given us well he's given some
[1:04:52] of us
[1:04:54] common sense. How many of you are
[1:04:56] thankful for common sense?
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; And the rest of you may have to buy
[1:05:00] yours, but uh God can grow it. I believe
[1:05:04] it. Let's turn in our Bible to uh
[1:05:07] Hebrews chapter 11 again.
[1:05:11] Guess what I'm going to preach on today?
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Samson.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Uh that's all I know these days, but
[1:05:19] we're almost done, but not quite. I
[1:05:22] heard several comments this week. Some
[1:05:24] people said, "I'm I'm ready. I'm about
[1:05:27] ready to be through with Samson."
[1:05:31] I said, "You are?" And they said, "Yes.
[1:05:33] It's way too close to home." Well, then
[1:05:36] then we then we need to keep Samson
[1:05:38] around for another month or so
[1:05:41] if he's helping us. Uh somebody else
[1:05:43] said, "You know, well, actually several
[1:05:46] people mentioned this week, you sure
[1:05:48] read a lot of quotes uh last Sunday."
[1:05:50] And uh when I hear that, I it just makes
[1:05:52] me know I ought to read some more.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Uh if it's good and it's the truth,
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; we ought to hear it.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; And I think some people think they know
[1:06:04] what he preached,
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; but they don't really know what he
[1:06:07] preached.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; And and so uh they ought to have to
[1:06:10] maybe hear it from all different angles.
[1:06:12] And that's what we try to do. But I'll
[1:06:14] try to be mindful of that in the future.
[1:06:16] Hebrews, uh 11:32.
[1:06:19] And what shall I more say? For the time
[1:06:23] would fail
[1:06:25] me to tell of Gideon, and of Barack, and
[1:06:28] of Samson, and of Jeepa, of David also,
[1:06:31] and Samuel, and of the prophets, who
[1:06:35] through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought
[1:06:40] righteousness, obtained promises,
[1:06:43] stopped the mouths of lions, quenched
[1:06:48] the violence of fire, escaped the edge
[1:06:51] of the sword. Out of weakness were
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; made strong, waxed valiant in fight,
[1:06:59] turned to flight. The armies of the
[1:07:03] aliens. Women received their dead raised
[1:07:07] to life again. And others were tortured,
[1:07:10] not accepting deliverance, that they
[1:07:13] might obtain a higher or better
[1:07:16] resurrection. and others had trial of
[1:07:19] cruel mockings and scourgings, yay,
[1:07:22] moreover, of bonds and imprisonment.
[1:07:24] They were stoned, they were saw a
[1:07:27] sunder, they were tempted, were slain
[1:07:29] with a sword. They wandered about in
[1:07:32] sheep skins and goat scans, being
[1:07:34] destitute, afflicted, tormented.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; I want to pause again and ask you, does
[1:07:41] anybody want to tell us how rough your
[1:07:43] week was?
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; I don't think so.
[1:07:48] I don't think that most of us have been
[1:07:51] dealing with this kind of trouble.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; They they they they were stoned,
[1:07:59] destitute. And look at verse 38. Of whom
[1:08:02] the world was not worthy.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; They wandered in deserts and in
[1:08:09] mountains and in dens and caves of the
[1:08:11] earth. AND THESE ALL ALL OF them a and
[1:08:16] the entire chapter before we started
[1:08:19] reading in verse 32 we call it the hall
[1:08:22] of faith because it lists all so many
[1:08:26] champions of God who by faith through
[1:08:30] faith accomplish so many powerful
[1:08:32] things. And yet the scripture ends, the
[1:08:34] chapter ends by saying, "And these all
[1:08:37] having obtained a good report through
[1:08:39] faith,
[1:08:42] received not
[1:08:45] the promise."
[1:08:48] My goodness,
[1:08:50] have you ever let the impact of that
[1:08:52] strike you? They paid the price,
[1:08:56] the ultimate price,
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; and yet they didn't receive the promise.
[1:09:00] And you're the reason. And I'm the
[1:09:03] reason
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; because it says God having provided
[1:09:08] something, some better thing for us
[1:09:14] that they
[1:09:16] without us should not be made perfect.
[1:09:24] Without our testimony of overcoming
[1:09:26] power, they will never be perfected. But
[1:09:30] if you and I will press this thing and
[1:09:33] overcome the spirit of Leodysia, if we
[1:09:36] will overcome the spirit of the age, not
[1:09:39] only will we receive THE PROMISE, BUT
[1:09:42] ALL these listed in Hebrews 11 and the
[1:09:45] saints and BRIDE OF EVERY OTHER AGE will
[1:09:48] also come to their perfection.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Why is that? Because God has laid it
[1:09:52] out. He's laid it out so beautifully for
[1:09:55] us in the older covenant and in the
[1:09:57] newer covenant. And he laid it out for
[1:10:00] us through history and seven church ages
[1:10:03] of history. Amen.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; And we know that we are at the climax,
[1:10:06] at the culmination, at the consummation
[1:10:09] of the ages. We've got to make it.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Somebody has TO SAY, "WE'VE GOT TO MAKE
[1:10:15] IT." And how are you going to make it?
[1:10:17] The same way the rest of them made it
[1:10:19] that far. By faith. Through faith. IN
[1:10:22] FAITH, WITH FAITH.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; AND WITHOUT FAITH, it is
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; impossible. impossible to please God.
[1:10:30] Father, thank you so much for every
[1:10:32] visitor who is gathered here today. It
[1:10:35] warms our hearts. Thank you for letting
[1:10:39] us wake up with that beautiful white
[1:10:41] snow. We love to see it come and we
[1:10:45] rejoice to see it go. But it reminds us,
[1:10:49] oh God, of of what it looks like when
[1:10:52] our scarlet red dark sins, dark sins,
[1:10:57] black sins were washed with your scarlet
[1:11:00] blood and made us, as scripture says,
[1:11:04] white as snow.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Lord, thank you for the cleansing power
[1:11:09] of grace and the blood. Meet us now at
[1:11:13] your word and we will give you praise
[1:11:16] and honor and glory. Bishma adonai
[1:11:19] Yeshua Hamashiach. In the name of the
[1:11:22] Lord Jesus Christ we pray. And the saint
[1:11:25] said,
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Judges chapter 16 is
[1:11:29] where we will go now. Also by now very
[1:11:32] familiar verses of scripture. We'll
[1:11:34] start in verse 23 and we will read all
[1:11:39] the way to verse 27. And then the lords
[1:11:42] of the Philistines gathered them
[1:11:44] together for to offer a great sacrifice
[1:11:48] unto Deeon their god. Remember Deeon,
[1:11:53] the god of the Philistines, part fish,
[1:11:55] part man. And uh there there's a
[1:11:58] beautiful rendition rendering of him.
[1:12:01] Can you imagine anything anybody
[1:12:03] worshiping that?
[1:12:06] It looks like a cartoon.
[1:12:09] has no power, no authority. It it is
[1:12:12] symbolized in idols. And when the ark of
[1:12:15] the covenant was placed in scripture in
[1:12:18] the in the place of worship where
[1:12:20] Deegon's major statue was kept, then he
[1:12:23] just broke off at the torso and bowed
[1:12:26] fell right over bowing to the God who
[1:12:29] was represented in that ark. So God
[1:12:32] already has power to defeat any other
[1:12:34] god with a little G, doesn't he?
[1:12:37] Remember it was it was in our scripture
[1:12:39] that it says uh that there is no god
[1:12:42] like unto thee among the gods.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean there are other gods.
[1:12:47] It means there are other gods that are
[1:12:48] worshiped.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Whatever an object of worship you have
[1:12:52] that can be your god.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; And I'm thankful that there's a one true
[1:12:57] living God. And we sung about him. I
[1:12:59] mean you sung about him this morning in
[1:13:01] worship. You really sung about him and
[1:13:04] you did it in spirit and in truth and
[1:13:07] you changed the atmosphere. I wouldn't I
[1:13:10] wouldn't be afraid to say you not only
[1:13:12] changed the atmosphere in this place,
[1:13:14] but I would say you shifted the
[1:13:16] atmosphere over the county because when
[1:13:19] we lift him up, when the praises of God
[1:13:22] go up, I know the authority of God, the
[1:13:25] government of God, and the blessings of
[1:13:27] God come down.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's worth any effort that you put
[1:13:32] forth to worship him.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; All the time. Not just in church, but
[1:13:38] all the time. For they said, "OUR GOD
[1:13:41] HATH DELIVERED SAMSON, our enemy, into
[1:13:44] our hand." And when THE PEOPLE SAW HIM,
[1:13:47] THEY PRAISED their God. For they said,
[1:13:50] "Our God hath delivered into our hands
[1:13:53] our enemy and the destroyer of our
[1:13:56] country." They were squatters then.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; And squatters now.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; It never was according to scripture
[1:14:06] their country. They just took it.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; And this enemy, this Samson slew many of
[1:14:13] us. And it came to pass when their
[1:14:15] hearts were merry that they call, THEY
[1:14:18] SAID, "CALL for Samson that he might
[1:14:22] make us sport." They wanted him to be
[1:14:25] entertainment for them. And they called
[1:14:28] for Samson out of the prison house and
[1:14:32] he made them sport and they set him
[1:14:36] between the pillars. Samson was blinded
[1:14:41] and now he is pushing and pulling the
[1:14:45] grinder to grind the grain which was
[1:14:49] considered a woman's work and they built
[1:14:52] prison houses. In fact, archaeology has
[1:14:55] discovered ruins of prison houses that
[1:14:59] were built specifically for that
[1:15:02] purpose. That the prisoners would be
[1:15:05] forced to grind the grain. Hundreds of
[1:15:09] them at a time, grinding the grain back
[1:15:12] and forth, pushing and pulling. And it
[1:15:16] must have been a humiliating task for
[1:15:18] someone who had been a judge in Israel
[1:15:20] for 20 years. Here he is doing woman's
[1:15:24] work in shackles behind bars held as a
[1:15:29] prisoner and blind. His eyesight, his
[1:15:33] vision was taken from him. And now
[1:15:37] they're pulling him into one of their
[1:15:38] festivals.
[1:15:40] 3,000 strong. They're gathered to make
[1:15:44] sport, to have entertainment, and to
[1:15:48] enjoy seeing a champion of Israel
[1:15:52] humbled, brought low. But I want to tell
[1:15:55] you again, like brother Cade was
[1:15:57] singing, uh, I DON'T KNOW WHO TOLD you
[1:15:59] that,
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; I don't know who told you that that uh,
[1:16:03] God is defeated. AND I DON'T KNOW WHO
[1:16:05] TOLD YOU THAT YOU CAN'T MAKE it through.
[1:16:07] AND I DON'T KNOW WHO TOLD THE
[1:16:08] PHILISTINES THAT they had won.
[1:16:11] But I know it wasn't over yet for you
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; and it wasn't over YET FOR SAMSON.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; GOD WASN'T FINISHED WITH him yet.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; And so look at verse 26. And Samson said
[1:16:23] unto the lad that held him by the hand,
[1:16:27] this little guide, this little servant
[1:16:30] boy that had been serving him, perhaps
[1:16:33] even in the prison, appointed to Samson
[1:16:36] to get him back and forth because he
[1:16:39] wasn't able to see and to guide himself.
[1:16:42] He said to this little lad, held him by
[1:16:45] the hand and and he said, "Suffer me
[1:16:48] THAT I MAY FEEL THE pillars whereupon
[1:16:52] the house standeth, that I may rest,
[1:16:56] that I may lean upon them." Now the
[1:17:00] house was full of men and women, and all
[1:17:02] the lords of the Philistines were there.
[1:17:05] And there were upon the roof about 3,000
[1:17:08] men and women that beheld while Samson
[1:17:12] made sport, while he entertained the
[1:17:16] crowd. We don't know what that looked
[1:17:18] like. Maybe it WAS JUST THE SIGHT of him
[1:17:21] that brought great celebration.
[1:17:24] Brother Vanom sort of uh dramatizes it.
[1:17:28] And I read lots of that to you last
[1:17:31] Sunday. And I don't want to I don't want
[1:17:32] to take as much time doing that today.
[1:17:34] But if you will allow me, I want to to
[1:17:37] uh revisit a couple places as we move
[1:17:41] forward in this today in the message in
[1:17:44] Hot Springs. Uh I I went back this week
[1:17:47] and and went through the entire sermon.
[1:17:50] Oh Lord, just once more, 1963, paragraph
[1:17:55] 51. He said, "And now as we sit here
[1:17:59] this afternoon, let's see if we can with
[1:18:02] imaginary mind place ourselves in that
[1:18:05] position to look at this scene." What do
[1:18:09] we see coming, moving out of the center
[1:18:13] of the arena? Come a little boy holding
[1:18:16] the hand of a blind man, stumbling,
[1:18:20] staggering along. They had many monkey
[1:18:23] shows and little tricks and so forth.
[1:18:25] But now has arrived the time for the
[1:18:28] main event. The thing that they had
[1:18:30] waited on so long, the main event of the
[1:18:34] day. The preliminaries over the halls
[1:18:38] ECHOED ALL AFTERNOON WITH DRUNKEN
[1:18:40] REVALRY. For they were celebrating
[1:18:42] victory over Deon, their fish god. And
[1:18:45] over the ark, now you're getting a
[1:18:49] little personal. the ark of the
[1:18:51] testimony because that was the
[1:18:53] representation of the promise of
[1:18:56] Jehovah. Look at there. He does have a
[1:18:58] name.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Now in paragraph 54, THE LAD MUST HAVE
[1:19:04] DRUGG along the there stumbling
[1:19:09] this great mass of human flesh. both
[1:19:12] eyes out, hair hanging down his back,
[1:19:15] tithed and bound to make entertainment
[1:19:17] for a drunken, BRAWLING BUNCH OF
[1:19:19] UNBELIEVERS. HE MUST HAVE STUMBLED TO
[1:19:21] THE POST TO WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO
[1:19:23] make fun start from. When I think of
[1:19:27] that, I THINK ABOUT A CHURCH, LISTEN,
[1:19:30] THAT WAS ORDAINED OF GOD TO DO SOMETHING
[1:19:33] FOR GOD AND IT SUFFERED THE ENEMY TO
[1:19:37] BLIND his eyes from the word. Listen.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; From the word
[1:19:45] you you SEE IN INSTEAD OF THE word we
[1:19:48] get a church creed.
[1:19:50] Instead of the word, we get an apostles
[1:19:53] creed or a nasine creed or we get a Hail
[1:19:57] Mary
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; or EVEN AS THE CATHOLICS CALL IT AN OUR
[1:20:02] FATHER.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; We we get some SUBSTITUTION
[1:20:07] BECAUSE OUR EYES ARE BLINDED TO THE
[1:20:09] reality of the word. And here is the
[1:20:14] comparison being drawn for us. Uh in in
[1:20:18] paragraph 55, I was going to start with
[1:20:21] A CHURCH THAT OUGHT TO BE shining in the
[1:20:24] power and the strength of the Lord. What
[1:20:28] a disgrace. Yeah.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; 56. How humiliating it must have been
[1:20:34] for Samson
[1:20:36] with all of his framework made up that
[1:20:40] was more than able and had proved God
[1:20:42] had his strength through his framework
[1:20:44] and every muscle that HE EVER HAD STILL
[1:20:46] WAS IN HIS BODY. But
[1:20:49] but butlessings
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; but the blessings of the Lord had left
[1:20:56] him. Your muscle won't do you any good.
[1:20:59] Your brain won't do you any good. YOUR
[1:21:01] JOB WON'T DO YOU. YOUR POSITION WON'T DO
[1:21:03] YOU. Your relationships won't do you any
[1:21:05] good IF THE BLESSINGS OF THE LORD are no
[1:21:08] longer upon your life.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Without God's favor, we always fail.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Without his blessing, we never prosper.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; In in 57 it says, "We may have all we
[1:21:19] may have all of our framework. We may
[1:21:21] have our denominational rituals. We may
[1:21:23] have our kids this and our youth that
[1:21:26] and our CAS and our missionets and our
[1:21:28] rangers and our come on right.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; We've got everything in place. We look
[1:21:32] like we've got it all together. We may
[1:21:34] have our names in the papers and on the
[1:21:37] ledgers,
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; but I wonder today if the Pentecostal
[1:21:42] church, now remember, we're not
[1:21:44] preaching on the Baptist
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; or the Methodist.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SPIRITFILLED PEOPLE.
[1:21:51] WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO HAVE
[1:21:52] KNOWN THE power of the Holy Ghost,
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; WHO'VE STAGGERED LIKE DRUNK MEN IN THE
[1:21:58] UPPER ROOM, WHO'VE PROPHESIED IN THE
[1:22:00] NAME OF THE LORD, WHO SPOKE IN TONGUES
[1:22:03] AND INTERPRETED TONGUES.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY GOING FORTH AND THE
[1:22:08] NINE GIFTS OF THE SPIRIT IN OPERATION
[1:22:10] among them. That's who we're talking to.
[1:22:13] We're talking to us.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. WITH HIS EYES POKED OUT from the
[1:22:19] word of God and for the PURPOSE THAT
[1:22:21] JESUS DIED THAT WE TOGETHER COULD
[1:22:24] FELLOWSHIP AROUND THE WORD and the
[1:22:26] things of God. What a precious privilege
[1:22:29] it is. And now we're going to paragraph
[1:22:31] 101 for just a moment in New York, NEW
[1:22:34] YORK 63. BUT NOW HE STANDS HOPELESS,
[1:22:39] STRIPPED OF POWER. IT'S THE SAME THING
[1:22:41] NOW. THE CHURCH STANDS THE SAME WAY
[1:22:43] WHERE ONCE THE CHURCH USED to
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; cast out devils.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Make sure you're with me.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Cast out devils.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Now we entertain them.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Now we don't want to stir them up.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Now we want to keep everybody calm. Now
[1:23:02] we're afraid of rubbing the devil the
[1:23:05] wrong way because we know he'll raise up
[1:23:07] his ugly head. Look, folk, he's going to
[1:23:09] do that anyway.
[1:23:11] You're not going to come to church in
[1:23:12] peace.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; He's going to do everything he can to
[1:23:15] harass you all the way here
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; AND HALFWAY THROUGH THE SERVICE IF you
[1:23:19] let him.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; But I want you to know, you don't have
[1:23:22] to call on the preacher to get rid of
[1:23:24] him.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; You can if you want to. BUT HE SAID HE'S
[1:23:27] GIVEN YOU AS A BELIEVER
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; all power,
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; ALL AUTHORITY over the devil.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; You can tell him to go. You can tell him
[1:23:39] to be gone from your life. You can cast
[1:23:41] him out of your own mind.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Anybody with me?
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; They used to raise the dead. They used
[1:23:48] TO DO THINGS THAT JESUS DID. Sin could
[1:23:50] not dwell among them.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE THE HOLY GHOST WAS SO real
[1:23:55] in the house.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit came in and condemned
[1:23:59] it. And if a man done something secretly
[1:24:02] and belonged to this Christian group, AS
[1:24:04] SOON AS HE COME IN, the Holy Spirit
[1:24:07] revealed his sin and he either did what?
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; He either repented or perished. But you
[1:24:14] see, we don't have it no more.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Does that offend you?
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Well, I hope you'll pay attention to it
[1:24:20] anyway. 102. And they won't receive it
[1:24:23] no more. And when it DOES COME, THEY TRY
[1:24:26] TO CALL IT AN EVIL SPIRIT.
[1:24:31] WHAT?
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE HOLY GHOST SHOWS UP,
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD WOULD DESIRE
[1:24:36] TO MOVE AMONG THEM, WHEN SOME OLD GRANNY
[1:24:39] WOULD START GIVING AN UTTERANCE in
[1:24:41] tongue
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; and some preacher, some deacon,
[1:24:47] SOME TRUSTEE, SOME ELDER, some something
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. WOULD RAISE UP AND CONDEMN IT
[1:24:53] AND CALL IT AN EVIL SPIRIT THAT THEY
[1:24:56] MIGHT RECEIVE that much more.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Did you hear what he's saying? They're
[1:25:01] doing exactly what they are supposed to
[1:25:04] do. They're bringing more condemnation
[1:25:07] on themselves and those who follow them
[1:25:10] into the ditch. Does that sound too ugly
[1:25:12] for some? Oh, no. Not for me. I want it
[1:25:15] gunar straight.
[1:25:20] Something has to condemn them. Something
[1:25:24] has to condemn that kind of behavior. HE
[1:25:26] SAID, "NO, STRIP OF POWER." WHAT MUST
[1:25:28] HAVE WENT THROUGH THE MAN'S MIND? ONCE
[1:25:31] THAT KIND OF A WARRIOR AND NOW A LITTLE
[1:25:33] BOY, a novice,
[1:25:37] a newcomer has to lead HIM AROUND. WHY?
[1:25:40] HE'S BLIND. He can't see. He has nothing
[1:25:44] to see with. And here's what a prophet
[1:25:46] said. God have mercy upon us. The church
[1:25:51] is so denominated
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; AND SO FAR AWAY TILL THE DEVIL HAS POKED
[1:25:56] OUT THE EYESIGHT, THE SPIRITUAL SIGHT
[1:25:59] THAT THIS IS THE word of God, not a
[1:26:03] creed. IT'S THE WORD AND GOD IS DUTY
[1:26:07] BOUND TO PRODUCE EVERYTHING THAT HE
[1:26:09] PROMISED in the Bible.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; WHEN FOR BIBLE DAYS ONLY?
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; NO.
[1:26:17] HE IS THE SAME yesterday
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; and today and forever. Amen.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; They they say, "BUT ISN'T THAT WHICH IS
[1:26:27] PERFECT? HASN'T THAT ALREADY COME?" YOU
[1:26:30] TELL me if there's perfect love ruling
[1:26:32] in the bride.
[1:26:37] YOU TELL ME IF YOU CAN FIND A GROUP OF
[1:26:39] PEOPLE THAT ARE operating in perfect
[1:26:41] love because that's the context of that
[1:26:44] verse of scripture. To call it anything
[1:26:47] else,
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; look out, brother Shelly, believe a
[1:26:51] will.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; To call it anything out is to take it
[1:26:54] out of context.
[1:26:56] Great.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; You know, UH, THE APOSTLE DIDN'T MAKE A
[1:26:59] MISTAKE WHEN HE'S WHEN HE'S, UH, WRITING
[1:27:01] THIS LETTER AND HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE
[1:27:03] GIFTS
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; AND ALL OF A SUDDEN HE STARTS TALKING
[1:27:06] ABOUT LOVE.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; And then in a LITTLE WHILE, HE STARTS
[1:27:12] TALKING ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
[1:27:14] SPIRIT AGAIN. WHY WOULD HE put love in
[1:27:17] the middle of it? BECAUSE THAT'S THE
[1:27:19] ONLY WAY THE TRUE GIFTS OF GOD can
[1:27:20] operate.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; They're not to operate in anything but
[1:27:24] love. They're not for private
[1:27:26] interpretation. We're not to use the
[1:27:28] nine gifts of the spirit as weapons
[1:27:30] against one another.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; We're supposed to let God come and have
[1:27:35] his wonderful way. And when perfect love
[1:27:38] is come, and we can say without a doubt
[1:27:41] that the headstone has been, not
[1:27:43] potentially so, NOT PROPHESIED SO, NOT
[1:27:46] PREACHED ABOUT SO, BUT WHEN WE SEE THAT
[1:27:49] IT HAS COME, that's
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:27:52] And you know, we even know how it's
[1:27:54] GOING TO COME. AND ZACHCHARIAH THE
[1:27:56] PROPHET TELLS US HOW IT'S GOING TO COME.
[1:27:58] THAT CAPPING IS COMING WITH SHOUTS of
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; grace. Grace.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Sister Pam's not here this morning, but
[1:28:09] she had a birthday this week. And first,
[1:28:13] very gingerly, I sent her a little happy
[1:28:15] birthday text. And then I thought, "Oh,
[1:28:18] she's picked on me.
[1:28:20] I think I'll pick on her. And I said,
[1:28:23] I'm talking about Pam Tibo. And I said,
[1:28:26] "Grace, Grace."
[1:28:29] And I think uh maybe maybe I don't know
[1:28:31] if Luke or Megan was around because she
[1:28:33] sent me a question mark. And then all of
[1:28:35] a sudden, either they told her or it hit
[1:28:38] her. She said, "Oh."
[1:28:41] I said, "You know, you get it, don't
[1:28:43] you? Five is the number of grace. Grace.
[1:28:45] Grace is five and a five. Uhhuh. It'll
[1:28:49] happen to the rest of you too before
[1:28:50] it's over, right? It will happen. BUT
[1:28:53] THAT'S HOW THE CAPSTONE COMES. It comes
[1:28:56] in such an hour that that an average or
[1:29:00] normal portion of grace WILL NOT SEEM
[1:29:02] ENOUGH TO GET US THROUGH THE PRESS. AND
[1:29:06] SO IT HAS TO COME IN AN ATMOSPHERE in an
[1:29:10] hour where grace GRACE IS BEING SHOUTED,
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; NOT ONLY PROCLAIMED, BUT PRAYED. GRACE.
[1:29:19] GRACE. We need it.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; WE DIDN'T JUST NEED IT TONIGHT. WE GOT
[1:29:25] SAVED. I NEEDED GRACE YESTERDAY AND THE
[1:29:28] DAY BEFORE AND I NEED IT TODAY. HELP ME.
[1:29:31] AND I'M GOING TO NEED IT TOMORROW AND
[1:29:34] THE NEXT DAY. AND GUESS WHAT? IT'S
[1:29:36] THERE.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; It's available. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:29:41] Look at Zechariah's prophecy and you'll
[1:29:43] see what the condition will be like. not
[1:29:46] only spiritually but physically and
[1:29:48] naturally. You'll see the hour uh spoken
[1:29:51] about when that final capping is going
[1:29:54] to come. We know what it is. We heard
[1:29:58] the prophet of the Old Testament. We've
[1:30:00] had a message to restore and a message
[1:30:03] to prepare the bride of Christ. So, we
[1:30:06] know exactly what it looks like. We know
[1:30:07] how it will operate. We've seen the
[1:30:10] ministry of Jesus updated again.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; So, we know exactly how sons of God WILL
[1:30:18] BE, HOW THEY WILL MANIFEST, WHAT KIND OF
[1:30:22] MIRACLES AND SIGNS WILL FOLLOW THEM.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; I don't preach this kind of stuff all
[1:30:26] the time.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to major on a sign and a
[1:30:30] wonder and a miracle, but I want you to
[1:30:32] know I believe in them,
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; and I believe you're going to need them
[1:30:36] until you're operating in perfect love.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "What about the right
[1:30:40] interpretation of the word?" Isn't that
[1:30:42] often how that verse was uh uh
[1:30:46] interpreted? And didn't even brother
[1:30:47] Brandon say some things like that? He
[1:30:49] may have, but today as a Berean,
[1:30:53] I'm going to put that quotation back in
[1:30:56] the word.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Is that okay?
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; And if I TAKE THAT QUOTATION AND PUT IT
[1:31:01] BACK IN the word, I've got to PUT IT IN
[1:31:03] THE CONTEXT OF the word.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; And it's talking about divine love.
[1:31:08] when that divine love Oh my
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; sir,
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; when there's a people who've got above
[1:31:13] their uh their uh complexes,
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; that's right,
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; their tendencies,
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; their predispositions,
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; and they're operating in that divine
[1:31:26] love.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Well, then in that hour, we won't need
[1:31:29] tongues and interpretation
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; cuz love will win it all.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Love will conquer it all. Love will
[1:31:37] deliver us from all. Somebody said,
[1:31:39] "That's kind of strange." I'm just
[1:31:40] telling you what Paul said. Is that
[1:31:41] okay?
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; And if that last church age of
[1:31:44] messenger, if he had a message that was
[1:31:46] anything different than the first church
[1:31:47] age messenger, he told us, "Well, you
[1:31:50] better you better stay with the word."
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what we will do. JUST A
[1:31:55] MINUTE. AMEN, PASTOR.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you for telling it just like it
[1:31:59] is. Oh, you're welcome, folks. See how
[1:32:02] that goes? That's how that happens. All
[1:32:04] right, let's go on.
[1:32:06] UH THEY SAY WELL WE BELIEVE YOU HAVEN'T
[1:32:09] GOT NO BELIEF COMING IF IT'S CONTRARY TO
[1:32:12] THIS THE MIND of Christ in you
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; YOU BELIEVE THE THINGS THAT CHRIST WROTE
[1:32:18] CUZ THIS IS CHRIST THE WORD but look at
[1:32:22] the condition look at the parallel when
[1:32:24] we see that what must have went through
[1:32:28] his mind Samson let's see what went
[1:32:32] through his mind we see that went
[1:32:36] through the warlord's mind of the fear.
[1:32:39] Just a moment. I I uh I wanted to finish
[1:32:44] out with 104 and 109. That's that's why
[1:32:47] I reposted those put them in the new
[1:32:49] notes. So, I'm skipping to 109. I'll try
[1:32:51] to catch myself. I took them out so that
[1:32:54] I wouldn't be tempted to reread them uh
[1:32:57] to you again. It ought to be a shame.
[1:33:00] Hold on now. It gets a little tough here
[1:33:01] for just a minute. It'll be quick.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; It'll be quick.
[1:33:05] Go ahead and spray some numbing on it
[1:33:08] now because here it comes. It ought to
[1:33:10] be a shame to a minister that will SIT
[1:33:12] AND READ THE BIBLE then walk out before
[1:33:15] the people. The world is full of lots.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Lot turned back, didn't he?
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Lot chose the world instead of the
[1:33:22] truth. Yeah.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; He said the Bible said that the sins of
[1:33:25] Sodom
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; vexed his righteous soul, but he didn't
[1:33:31] have the courage
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; to stand up
[1:33:36] and rebuke that sin.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; And and you know, besides that,
[1:33:43] grandma's buried in the backyard.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; So, we could never change churches.
[1:33:48] Right.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; But we're going to have to have a
[1:33:50] determination in the last of the last
[1:33:52] days
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; to stand on the word.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; I mean stand on it with everything that
[1:33:57] we have.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; It has it can't just be a part of why we
[1:34:01] live. It needs to be the reason why we
[1:34:03] live.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; And there is many men today. He says,
[1:34:07] and I say this with reverence only with
[1:34:10] love, but just to say truth, we may
[1:34:12] never meet again. He said, "Let me get
[1:34:15] it out here. I may never have this
[1:34:16] chance again. There's many a man that
[1:34:19] reads this same Bible that we read, sits
[1:34:21] in his office preparing his message and
[1:34:24] run upon these truths of God because
[1:34:26] they're right in the Bible.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; And have to bypass them.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Hello. He'd be afraid to preach against
[1:34:33] women cutting their hair. HIS
[1:34:34] ORGANIZATION WOULD TURN HIM OUT,
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; even though they all used to have that
[1:34:39] as a doctrine.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; His organization would turn him out. I
[1:34:43] told you you needed some numbing.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; And about wearing immoral clothes and
[1:34:48] committing spiritual adultery. They all
[1:34:50] used to preach against it. And about men
[1:34:53] that WOULD TAKE THEIR SOCIABLE DRINK ON
[1:34:55] CHRISTMAS AND gets out and has a little
[1:34:57] clean American fun telling dirty jokes.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Still maintaining HIS OFFICE AS A
[1:35:03] DEACON.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; It's worse than that. They stand out the
[1:35:08] front door and smoke their cigarette
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; AND COME INSIDE AND DO THE DEACONING.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; You have my permission not to listen to
[1:35:17] a deacon that would do such a thing as
[1:35:19] that.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; He's got to be an example.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; They know them THINGS ARE WRONG, BUT
[1:35:24] THEY'RE AS IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF LOT.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; We're back to that sinful place again.
[1:35:30] SEE? OH, HOW SAMSON MUST HAVE BEEN
[1:35:32] REMINDED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT HOW HE HAD
[1:35:34] FAILED GOD'S PEOPLE and failed God
[1:35:37] himself. Now he's a prisoner. Now he is
[1:35:39] a prisoner. Now he is a prisoner of the
[1:35:43] very thing that God raised him up and
[1:35:45] gave him power.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; To destroy.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Now he's a slave to it.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; You had an opportunity to kill it. You
[1:35:58] had an opportunity to dig it out by the
[1:36:00] root. You had an opportunity to walk in
[1:36:03] deliverance from it, but you wouldn't
[1:36:05] deal with it and you wouldn't do
[1:36:06] anything about it. And now, brother
[1:36:08] Random said, "It has taken you captive."
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; Samson wasting his time.
[1:36:16] Uh this uh
[1:36:19] well, I don't know what to say.
[1:36:22] You know, when when passion and
[1:36:26] sexuality is more important than the vow
[1:36:29] you make to God,
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; It's going to put your head in the wrong
[1:36:33] person's lap.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; You're going to lose your power. All
[1:36:36] right.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; You're also going to create a soul tie.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; That's going to harass you the rest of
[1:36:42] your life if you don't get deliverance
[1:36:43] from it.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Better listen.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; It'll bind you. When you give yourself
[1:36:49] away to someone you're not married to,
[1:36:51] you're binding yourself.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; You knew when you laid down with her,
[1:36:56] you wasn't going to have her tomorrow.
[1:36:57] You knew you wasn't going to live with
[1:36:59] her. You knew you weren't even going to
[1:37:00] build a relationship with her.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; She was a cheap thrill.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; But what you didn't understand was you
[1:37:08] created a connection
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; because that intimacy is reserved. Is
[1:37:12] that too rough for 2026?
[1:37:15] Because that intimacy is reserved
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; for the confines and boundaries of
[1:37:20] marriage.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; And when PEOPLE STEP BEYOND THAT,
[1:37:24] they're creating soul ties
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; that that a marriage won't break.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; You've got to have some authority.
[1:37:31] You've got to find a place of authority
[1:37:33] to begin to deal with that kind of thing
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; or that name will come up or that
[1:37:38] picture will come up or that memory will
[1:37:40] come up and harass you
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; the rest of your life. and we have
[1:37:44] nobody to blame but ourselves. We should
[1:37:47] do what we know to do.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; There's strength for us.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; And and let me also say there's
[1:37:53] forgiveness for us
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; if we don't.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; I don't want anyone to leave here
[1:37:58] condemned. But I want you to know it's
[1:38:00] not as innocent as the world would have
[1:38:01] you to think.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Nobody else but no. Somebody Somebody
[1:38:06] say only Only the two of us know. You're
[1:38:08] so wrong.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; You're so wrong. The one who sees all
[1:38:11] and knows all.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. He knows.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; It's a hindrance. I tell you, in the
[1:38:16] church today, it's a big old hindrance.
[1:38:18] JUST READ THE NEWS. OH, HE MUST HAVE
[1:38:20] BEEN REMINDED. NOW HE'S A PRISONER OF
[1:38:22] THE VERY THING THAT GOD RAISED HIM UP
[1:38:24] and gave him power to destroy. I want to
[1:38:27] say another thing. You stray from your
[1:38:29] marriage vow. You're walking on very
[1:38:31] dangerous ground.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; You may think you're getting by,
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; but God's liable to send a bird to tell
[1:38:38] on you.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Listen. Amen.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; You've got children to think about.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; You've got a lovely wife to think about.
[1:38:48] If she's no longer lovely, it's what
[1:38:49] you've done to her.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; Living with you and ugly anybody.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; I'm just telling it like it is.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Let's go on.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; I'm a member. I'm in THIS WITH YOU. NOT
[1:39:01] A MEMBER OF AN ORGANIZATION. GOD FORBID.
[1:39:03] HE SAID, "BUT I'M A MEMBER BY GRACE IN
[1:39:05] THE BODY OF CHRIST. I'M YOUR BROTHER. I
[1:39:07] HAVE NO SELFISH MOTIVE. MY MOTIVE TO
[1:39:09] ACHIEVE ANYTHING PERSONALLY. I AM ONLY
[1:39:11] ZEALOUS
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; ZEALOUS
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; for the Lord God.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; And I say this with all my heart. I'll
[1:39:16] tell you, I appreciate somebody who
[1:39:18] would say it then and I appreciate
[1:39:21] somebody who would say it now.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; The very thing that you were called out
[1:39:24] of, you're gone back into it again.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's rough talk.
[1:39:32] And as the Bible said, as the S goes to
[1:39:34] her wallow and a dog returns to its
[1:39:36] vomit, and listen, he said, IF THE VOMIT
[1:39:38] MADE THE DOG sick in the first place,
[1:39:40] won't it make him even sicker the second
[1:39:42] time?
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; You tell me.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Help us.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; And if some of you are secondg guessing
[1:39:48] the weekend you came, huh? Maybe
[1:39:51] maybe some of you thought the weather
[1:39:53] was going to hold you up and now you're
[1:39:55] wishing it had of. If if organization
[1:39:58] and create that little bit of snow
[1:40:00] laying at the end of your driveway could
[1:40:01] have easily kept some of you from
[1:40:03] church, but I'm glad that you didn't let
[1:40:05] it
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; because you needed to be here. God had
[1:40:08] an appointment with you here.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; He We're not through yet.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; He said, or if organization and creeds
[1:40:14] that had GOT THE PEOPLE SO BOUND UP AND
[1:40:16] GOD CALLED YOU OUT TO BE A FREE PEOPLE
[1:40:18] AND YOU TURNED RIGHT BACK AROUND and
[1:40:19] done the same THING AGAIN, HE SAID IT'S
[1:40:21] A GREATER SIN.
[1:40:24] Now they had him doing tricks.
[1:40:28] THE CHAMPION OF THE LORD
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; SLAYED A THOUSAND MEN WITH A JAWBONE OF
[1:40:33] A DONKEY.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; YOU know I didn't want to say donkey,
[1:40:36] don't you?
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; But I did for you.
[1:40:40] SLAY A THOUSAND MEN WITH A jawbone of a
[1:40:48] donkey.
[1:40:51] TOOK THE GATES OF GAZA,
[1:40:54] COME WALKING DOWN THE HILL WITH HIM.
[1:40:59] He knew the power, the supernatural
[1:41:02] POWER OF GOD. AND NOW HE'S BLINDED AND
[1:41:05] TIED UP LIKE A PRISONER, LOCKED IN A
[1:41:08] PRISON DOING WOMEN'S WORK, slave work,
[1:41:12] REALLY. AND THEN NOW HE'S PARADED AROUND
[1:41:16] LIKE SOME KIND OF exhibit
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; in a circus.
[1:41:21] Oh, he must HAVE THOUGHT. HE MUST HAVE
[1:41:24] THOUGHT ABOUT IT WHEN HE WAS STANDING
[1:41:26] THERE WHAT IT FELT LIKE. REMEMBER IN
[1:41:29] THAT FINAL MOMENT THAT HE TOLD THE
[1:41:31] SECRET AND DELILAH had his hair SHAVED
[1:41:34] OFF AND HE HE SHE SCREAMED. SOMEBODY
[1:41:37] SCREAM, "THE PHILISTINES ARE UPON THEE
[1:41:39] AGAIN." And he raises up. He thought,
[1:41:41] "It'll be just like the next time. The
[1:41:43] last time. I mean, it'll be just like
[1:41:44] the last time." and he shook himself and
[1:41:48] he waited on the on that mighty raw
[1:41:51] power of God to seize him like it had
[1:41:52] all those other times. And this time
[1:41:55] there was nothing. Not a whistle, not a
[1:41:58] whisper, not a goosebump,
[1:42:02] not one single hair on his body stood
[1:42:05] up.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; And all he could all the scripture can
[1:42:10] tell us about his moment was he wished
[1:42:13] not. He wished not that the spirit of
[1:42:16] the Lord had departed from him. You
[1:42:18] know, I want to give Samson some credit
[1:42:20] today.
[1:42:21] The Bible did. I just read about him in
[1:42:24] the in the in the hall of faith
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; in the hall of faithfilled champions.
[1:42:30] His name is there.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; Have you failed God? Don't worry. He can
[1:42:35] redeem his purpose in you.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; He can transfer you out of the gutter of
[1:42:40] your own self-will and place you in the
[1:42:42] hall of faith. If you'll recognize, I
[1:42:45] WANT TO GIVE SAMSON CREDIT RIGHT NOW FOR
[1:42:47] EVEN RECOGNIZING THAT THE SPIRIT OF GOD
[1:42:51] HAD LEFT THE BUILDING
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE COUNTLESS PEOPLE MEET WEEK AFTER
[1:42:57] WEEK AFTER WEEK AFTER WEEK DOING THE
[1:42:59] SAME TRICKS,
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; GOING THROUGH THE SAME MOTIONS,
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; NOT DISCERNING
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; THAT THE SPIRIT OF GOD HAS LEFT THE
[1:43:09] BUILDING,
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; THAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN OVER THE JUST
[1:43:13] QUOTING the word
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; and they don't even know the difference
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; because they can still get excited with
[1:43:18] the song and lovely singing and all the
[1:43:20] good things they enjoy so much. I I want
[1:43:22] to give Sam Samson some credit. He
[1:43:25] realized when he shook himself, whoa,
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; that don't feel like it did the last
[1:43:30] time. And the last time and the last
[1:43:32] time,
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Samson, you you've got a price to pay.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; You gave your secret away. Amen.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; And the enemy has taken advantage.
[1:43:40] Sometimes we ought to shut up. Really?
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; WE DO SO MUCH COMPLAINING UNTIL THE
[1:43:46] devil knows what bothers us the most.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Cuz we talk it, talk it, talk it, talk
[1:43:50] it, talk.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Just a minute. I'm baptizing
[1:43:54] myself.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; Evidently, I can't talk and drink at the
[1:43:59] same time.
[1:44:05] Now, let me bathe. Clean up. Now, use a
[1:44:07] towel.
[1:44:10] Now this mighty champion is doing tricks
[1:44:14] to entertain them. And that's just about
[1:44:17] listen. He said that's just about the
[1:44:18] way it's got. Oh my.
[1:44:22] Instead I can't hardly read it without
[1:44:24] feeling it. Instead
[1:44:28] of the Holy Spirit of a Holy Spirit.
[1:44:36] Give me just one minute. I I don't want
[1:44:38] to Yes.
[1:44:40] THAT WHEN SOMEONE RAISES up and gets
[1:44:43] arrogant,
[1:44:46] we have it sometime.
[1:44:48] THE HOLY SPIRIT IS OBLIGATED TO GOD TO
[1:44:52] SHUT that thing up.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "I've seen them pack them from
[1:44:56] the meeting." This is I didn't say this.
[1:44:59] I'm just reading, but I believe it.
[1:45:02] Paralyzed, blinded, dumb, and even die
[1:45:04] at the meeting, drop dead while they're
[1:45:06] TRYING TO REBUKE IT. GOD IN HEAVEN knows
[1:45:09] that's right. Many of you here have been
[1:45:10] in other meetings and witnessed the same
[1:45:13] thing. We read it in the book of Acts.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Ananas and Safh judged by lying to the
[1:45:21] Holy Ghost.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; HE SAID THERE OUGHT TO BE A HOLY POWER
[1:45:24] SURROUNDING AND IN the church
[1:45:27] SURROUNDING THE CHURCH AND IN THE CHURCH
[1:45:30] THAT'LL MAKE DEMONS FLEE.
[1:45:32] Instead of that, it's become a
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; it's become a place of entertainment.
[1:45:39] You see, I'm old enough to remember when
[1:45:41] the glory cloud when when the divine
[1:45:44] midst of the presence of the shakana,
[1:45:48] the shikina glory would come into those
[1:45:51] meetings.
[1:45:52] I've sat on the front bench like these
[1:45:54] ladies sitting here this morning and
[1:45:57] I've seen it become very very cloudy
[1:46:00] with my own eyes. I don't know which eye
[1:46:03] I was looking with. Uh I know I wiped my
[1:46:06] own eye and it didn't clear it up. So
[1:46:08] maybe it was a spiritual eye, but I've
[1:46:10] seen that glory cloud come in blue like
[1:46:14] grayish smoke come in and just hang
[1:46:17] between where I was sitting and the pull
[1:46:18] pit. And I knew that I was in the
[1:46:21] presence of God.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; I knew that the Lord was in the
[1:46:24] building. And I knew that anything I had
[1:46:26] need of, all I had to do was ask.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not the only Pentecostal. Who's
[1:46:32] ever seen anything like that?
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; I grew up in an atmosphere where demons
[1:46:36] were cast out, where alcoholics were set
[1:46:39] free.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Anybody with me?
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I grew up in a church out
[1:46:44] there on highway on the highway between
[1:46:47] uh here and and Callaway.
[1:46:50] And I
[1:46:52] remember the days when we would hear
[1:46:55] them 18-wheelers lock up their brakes
[1:46:59] as they flew down that highway.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; Because they had slammed them on because
[1:47:05] they had seen something COMING OUT OF
[1:47:07] THE TOP OF THE church house.
[1:47:10] Many many times they would Are you
[1:47:13] saying many times? Yes, I'm saying many
[1:47:15] times. Multiple times it happened as a
[1:47:18] child. THEY SLAMMED ON BRAKES AND THEY
[1:47:20] COME BANKING IN THE BACK PARKING lot of
[1:47:23] that of that old honky tonk that had
[1:47:25] been made into a church. And we could
[1:47:28] hear the gravel
[1:47:30] as they come in and we could hear the
[1:47:32] scrub as they locked down. And that old
[1:47:36] back door would open up and a a big old
[1:47:39] I don't know why they were all big, but
[1:47:40] they were all big.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Some big old truck driver would come
[1:47:44] staggering up the side aisle,
[1:47:48] make his way all the way to the altar.
[1:47:50] Didn't matter if they were singing,
[1:47:51] didn't matter they were preaching,
[1:47:53] DIDN'T MATTER WHAT THEY WERE DOING. MAKE
[1:47:54] HIS WAY DOWN. And that altar bench that
[1:47:57] was sitting here during the anniversary,
[1:48:00] I'VE SEEN THEM FALL AT THAT SAME ALTAR
[1:48:02] bench and give THEIR HEARTS TO GOD. AND
[1:48:05] WHEN THEY GOT UP, THEY'D SAY, "WELL,
[1:48:07] WHAT MADE YOU STOP?" WELL, IT WAS THAT
[1:48:10] FIREBALL HANGING over the church. OR
[1:48:12] THEY'D SAY, "IT WAS A FIREBALL hanging
[1:48:15] in the middle of the road." And we knew
[1:48:17] that it HAD TO BE AN INVITATION. It had
[1:48:20] to BE SOME SIGN OF GOD'S presence
[1:48:23] calling us back to him. Amen.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Now, we're living in an hour where THE
[1:48:28] CHURCH HAS HAD TO TRY TO FIGURE A WAY TO
[1:48:31] TO SORT OF IMITATE,
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; RIGHT,
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; and counterfeit those things.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; You go into an average charismatic
[1:48:38] church ON A SUNDAY MORNING, SUNDAY
[1:48:40] NIGHT, THEY TURN OFF ALL THE LIGHTS.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; I was called to preach in a church in
[1:48:49] Ohio. My wife went with me some years
[1:48:51] back, little country church, and turned
[1:48:53] off all the lights. said, "We're going
[1:48:54] to see just how like the worldly
[1:48:56] churches they could be." They turned off
[1:48:58] all the lights. I got up, went to the
[1:49:00] pastor and said, "If you don't turn the
[1:49:01] lights back on, I'm leaving."
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "You haven't even preached
[1:49:06] yet." And I said, "I won't be preaching.
[1:49:07] I didn't come to sit here in a
[1:49:09] nightclub. I came here TO GIVE THE WORD
[1:49:12] OF THE LORD, AND IF YOU'RE NOT
[1:49:15] INTERESTED in it, it won't be any hard
[1:49:16] feelings."
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; But I'm not going to sit here like that.
[1:49:20] It's an atmosphere of entertainment. We
[1:49:22] didn't come to be entertained. Amen.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; We didn't come to watch a smoke machine
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; counterfeit what I saw genuine.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; DID YOU NOT UNDERSTAND WHERE THEY GOT
[1:49:33] THE IDEA?
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; It either COME FROM THE ROCK CONCERT
[1:49:38] or it CAME FROM AN IMITATION OR
[1:49:40] COUNTERFEIT of what the old-timers USED
[1:49:43] TO TALK ABOUT.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; WE DIDN'T NEED strobe lights. No,
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; NO, SIR.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE SAW MANY TIMES THAT AMBER
[1:49:51] LIGHT
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; moving around the building. THERE ARE
[1:49:55] PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM TODAY THAT HAVE SEEN
[1:49:58] IT.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; There were teenagers in THE CHURCH HOUSE
[1:50:02] IN COLUMBUS. THERE WERE TEENAGERS
[1:50:04] BAPTIZED WITH THE HOLY GHOST AS THEY
[1:50:07] STOOD UNDER A PILLAR OF FIRE THAT HUNG
[1:50:10] VISIBLY IN THE CHURCH.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; PREACH.
[1:50:14] SO, IT HASN'T BEEN MANY GENERATIONS AGO.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; HE'S STILL GONE. SOMEBODY SAID, "DO WE
[1:50:21] NEED TO SEE SMOKE?" NO.
[1:50:24] Do we HAVE TO SEE FLASHING LIGHTS? NO.
[1:50:28] IS ALL THAT NECESSARY? NO.
[1:50:31] But it would be all right
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; if the atmosphere was right
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT WAS IN THAT ATMOSPHERE THAT
[1:50:40] WE SAW DEMONS cast out and cancerous
[1:50:43] TUMORS FALL OUT AND BLINDED EYES OPEN
[1:50:46] AND BROKEN BACKS HEALED.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE IF THERE'S A LIGHT OR A
[1:50:52] MIST OR A SMELL OR ANY OF THAT. BUT I DO
[1:50:55] CARE IF JESUS IS NOT SHOWING UP.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; AND PROVING HIMSELF.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; That responsibility doesn't all fall on
[1:51:05] the pulpit.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; It does not.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; It falls on a body.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; To create an atma. And we we've done it
[1:51:11] many times. Nobody around here needs to
[1:51:14] be taught how.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; We know how to do it. Come on.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; We've just got to make sure that we
[1:51:20] hunger, we thirst, we cry out for it
[1:51:24] because we've got to have him. We've got
[1:51:26] to have him. Let's go back to where we
[1:51:28] were.
[1:51:30] There ought to BE A HOLY POWER
[1:51:33] surrounding in the church that will MAKE
[1:51:35] DEMONS FLEE. INSTEAD OF THAT, IT'S
[1:51:37] BECOMING A LAUGHING STOCK. WHAT IS IT?
[1:51:38] THE mechanics
[1:51:41] instead of
[1:51:46] and he says that a little differently.
[1:51:49] He usually explains the mechanics and
[1:51:51] explains the dynamics and he says to us
[1:51:54] the mechanics do don't do much good
[1:51:57] without the dynamic. You can have a
[1:52:00] brand new shiny motor, brand new
[1:52:03] transmission, plenty of brand new spark
[1:52:05] plugs and ignition AND FULL OF GAS and
[1:52:11] but YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE SOMETHING ELSE
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; TO MAKE THAT THING GO. YOU'VE GOT TO
[1:52:17] HAVE NOT JUST MECHANICS IN PLACE. YOU'VE
[1:52:20] GOT TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT'LL carry that
[1:52:21] spark
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; TO THE FUEL.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE ALSO GOT TO HAVE THE DYNAMICS.
[1:52:28] AND HERE HE SAID THE MECHANICS SETTLING
[1:52:31] FOR THE MECHANICS
[1:52:33] instead of
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; I'm my
[1:52:40] are you here?
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm so glad you are.
[1:52:44] I'd rather you be here than anywhere
[1:52:46] else. Thank you for being here. Somebody
[1:52:49] said, "WHERE DO YOU GET THAT FROM?" MARK
[1:52:50] 16:es 15-18. And he said unto them, "Go
[1:52:54] ye into all THE WORLD AND PREACH THE
[1:52:56] GOSPEL to every creature." Now, if you
[1:52:58] read the footnotes in a Scoffield Bible
[1:53:01] that he wrote after he got out of
[1:53:03] prison,
[1:53:08] you might find that little place where
[1:53:09] he says
[1:53:12] CI Scofield where he says, you know,
[1:53:15] this this may not be inspired.
[1:53:19] Well, that's because he was a
[1:53:20] sensationist. He wanted to
[1:53:24] prepare a way
[1:53:27] to teach that miracles were passed and
[1:53:31] the healing, divine healing, even all
[1:53:34] those signs and wonders THAT WE READ
[1:53:36] ABOUT IN THE BIBLE. He wanted to prepare
[1:53:38] the people to believe that they had
[1:53:40] finished. Sounds like some modern
[1:53:42] message people I know today.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Maybe they've been reading the footnotes
[1:53:46] in the Scoffield Bible more than they've
[1:53:48] been hearing what the prophet said.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; You think it's Are we just being real
[1:53:52] today?
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; I came here to be real. Amen.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; This is Brother Brent's birthday today.
[1:53:58] And he didn't come here for for a
[1:54:00] flowery birthday message full of
[1:54:02] compromise. How do you know? Cuz I know
[1:54:04] him. He wanted the truth, the whole
[1:54:06] truth, and nothing but the truth. SO IF
[1:54:09] YOU DON'T LIKE IT, IT'S HIS birthday
[1:54:10] present anyhow.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; THERE HE IS. HALLELUJAH. GO INTO ALL THE
[1:54:18] WORLD, PREACH THE GOSPEL TO EVERY
[1:54:20] CREATURE. HE THAT BELIEVETH IS BAPTIZED
[1:54:22] SHALL BE SAVED. BUT HE THAT BELIEVETH
[1:54:24] NOT,
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; OH, not a God of love and mercy, not a
[1:54:28] God who cares, not a Surely, surely,
[1:54:31] surely, in an AGE WHERE ULTIMATE
[1:54:33] RECONCILIATION IS PREACHED IN MANY
[1:54:35] PLACES, THAT EVERYBODY'S going to be
[1:54:38] saved in the end, that hell is going to
[1:54:40] empty itself out, and those who have
[1:54:42] spent some time in hell are coming out
[1:54:43] of hell to receive salvation and have
[1:54:45] eternal life. No, sir.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; No, sir. That's not the truth. That's
[1:54:50] not the Bible. As a tree falls,
[1:54:53] it lies there just like that. You don't
[1:54:56] have an opportunity after death.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; You've got an opportunity now to be born
[1:55:00] again of the spirit of God.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; And these signs,
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; shall follow them
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; that believe. Well, they're not
[1:55:12] following me. Then believe in my name.
[1:55:15] Shall they
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; cast out devils.
[1:55:19] But now when the when the last message
[1:55:21] comes, they won't have any more tongues
[1:55:24] among them. THAT'S NOT WHAT IT SAYS
[1:55:25] HERE.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; IT SAYS THEY SHALL SPEAK
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; WITH NEW TONGUES. THEY SHALL TAKE UP
[1:55:32] SERPENTS.
[1:55:33] I don't think that means we go gather
[1:55:35] them up.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; If you go gather them with your hand,
[1:55:41] then we'll see what we might do with
[1:55:42] them, you know. But I don't think
[1:55:44] anybody wants to do such a thing as
[1:55:45] that. That would be tempting the Lord.
[1:55:48] But if you, like the apostle,
[1:55:51] should gather firewood and a viper latch
[1:55:54] on to you, I have to believe. I can't
[1:55:57] help myself.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; I have to believe that if God did it for
[1:56:01] the apostle,
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; I have to believe he's able to do it for
[1:56:04] me.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; And they just shook it off. Now there
[1:56:08] was a purpose in that
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; because among those people on that
[1:56:12] island, they believed that there would
[1:56:15] come mighty men who would have power
[1:56:19] that would would be higher and it would
[1:56:21] supersede the power of the of any demon
[1:56:25] of any enemy to harm them. And
[1:56:28] specifically they had this idea that
[1:56:30] that vipers po because there were many
[1:56:33] on the island and they were taking many
[1:56:35] people out. But they believed in their
[1:56:38] tradition that there would be men who
[1:56:40] would come who would have power who
[1:56:41] would exercise power over those
[1:56:44] serpents. And God knew exactly what he
[1:56:46] was doing. He sent the right man
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; at the right time
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; and instead of panicking
[1:56:53] it just shook it off in the fire. If you
[1:56:56] ever find yourself in that kind of a
[1:56:58] position, you may absolutely see the
[1:57:00] same result. But I don't think you ought
[1:57:02] to be tempting the Lord.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; I know some of the mountain people have
[1:57:06] have took up the serpent and it's a very
[1:57:08] fascinating thing from a distance.
[1:57:15] Kind of like Wendy Bagwell. You remember
[1:57:17] Wendy? How many of you remember Wendy?
[1:57:19] They got it got to a church like that
[1:57:21] and they were singing and and said they
[1:57:24] got to shouting and he said there they
[1:57:26] come out with them rattlesnakes and he
[1:57:29] looked at Geraldine and said she was
[1:57:32] pale as a ghost and was backing up
[1:57:34] against the wall and he said there was a
[1:57:37] woman took it up and and then threw it
[1:57:39] down on the ground put her barefoot on
[1:57:41] top of that thing's head and said that
[1:57:44] was about more than they could take and
[1:57:46] said one of them said she look around.
[1:57:49] LOOK AROUND here and see IF YOU CAN FIND
[1:57:52] THE BACK DOOR. WE CAN GO OUT.
[1:57:55] Why are you looking at me like I ought
[1:57:56] not to be telling jokes? That was on the
[1:57:58] Christian radio station. How many of you
[1:57:59] heard it? Couldn't be wrong to tell
[1:58:01] that.
[1:58:03] And so said, uh, is there a back door?
[1:58:06] AND AND SAID WENDY, NO. SAID, I'VE DONE
[1:58:09] LOOKED AND there ain't none. There ain't
[1:58:11] no back door. Said reckon where do they
[1:58:13] want one?
[1:58:16] SO I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT KIND.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about when YOU ARE IN A
[1:58:22] SITUATION WHERE YOU NEED THE Lord's
[1:58:25] intervention.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; He's able.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; THEY SHALL LAY HANDS ON THE SICK.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; I'm reading scripture now.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; And they shall recover.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; And then in Mark 16:19 and 20. So then
[1:58:39] after the Lord HAD SPOKEN UNTO THEM, he
[1:58:42] was received up into THE HEAVEN AND SAT
[1:58:44] ON THE RIGHT HAND OF POWER and
[1:58:46] authority, and they went forth and
[1:58:48] preached everywhere. The Lord,
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; working with them, AND DOING WHAT?
[1:58:56] CONFIRMING THE WORD.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; PHOENIX, ARIZONA, same message. I'm
[1:59:06] moving on.
[1:59:09] Paragraph 24. I can just hear all the
[1:59:11] warriors around. All the ladies are
[1:59:12] beads and bracelets and fine jewels and
[1:59:16] so forth. I I left that one in there
[1:59:19] because he gets specific and so forth
[1:59:22] and SAID, "SO THIS IS SAMSON.
[1:59:24] THIS IS THE MIGHTY ONE THAT YOU'VE
[1:59:28] TALKED ABOUT. THIS IS THE MAN THAT YOU
[1:59:30] SAID THE SPIRIT OF THE GREAT GODS LIVED
[1:59:32] IN. THIS IS THE MAN THAT COULD TAKE OVER
[1:59:35] OUR NATION THAT you talked about." But
[1:59:37] look at him now.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; I got a feeling the devils mock the
[1:59:42] church the same way.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; What an example. What a lesson it ought
[1:59:46] to BE TO US. WHAT A SOLEMN THING IT
[1:59:48] OUGHT TO BE. WE SHOULD NOT JUST APPROACH
[1:59:49] THIS AS JUST COME TOGETHER to have a
[1:59:51] good time in a celebration. WE'VE COME
[1:59:54] TOGETHER TO SEE WHERE WE ARE STANDING
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING TO US. AMEN.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; And I could hear Samson no doubt could
[2:00:02] hear from one side and the other one of
[2:00:03] people who'd heard about him, well this
[2:00:05] is so this is Samson. I wonder today if
[2:00:08] the enemy can also at this time say
[2:00:11] about the thing about our Pentecostal
[2:00:12] move, the same thing
[2:00:15] just to SPEAK THE NAME SAMSON. THEY'D
[2:00:17] ALL GET NERVOUS because he was anointed
[2:00:19] servant of God born with a Nazerite vow.
[2:00:21] And they knowed that there was nothing
[2:00:23] could stop that Nazerite gift as long as
[2:00:26] he held it. He was God's chosen man of
[2:00:29] the day. God's chosen messenger of the
[2:00:32] day. Many of them thought what this must
[2:00:34] be. Many of them remembered him. Many
[2:00:36] remembered as they looked at this
[2:00:38] helpless CREATURE STANDING THERE WITH
[2:00:39] HIS ARMS WRAPPED AROUND THE POST, BLIND,
[2:00:44] making fun of him, hitting him WITH
[2:00:46] WHIPS, SAYING, "COME ON OUT, SAMSON. YOU
[2:00:49] GREAT STRONG MAN. DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
[2:00:51] YOU'RE SO STRONG. WHERE IS YOUR GOD?"
[2:00:54] I'M TELLING YOU, they were really
[2:00:55] mocking. Yes, sir. And then he said, "If
[2:00:57] that JUST ISN'T ABOUT THE SAME WAY THE
[2:00:58] ENEMY LIKES TO DO WHAT HE CAN GET YOU
[2:01:00] DOWN."
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; BUT HE DARES TO TRY THAT AS LONG AS THE
[2:01:05] POWER of God is operating through the
[2:01:07] church. Listen, HE HE WOULD BE AFRAID TO
[2:01:10] DO THAT WHEN THE NAZERITE blessings are
[2:01:13] upon you. But he can see you whipped.
[2:01:16] That's when he makes fun of you. The
[2:01:17] devil. Oh yes. That's when he can say
[2:01:20] there's no difference between them and
[2:01:21] us. They're just same man like we are.
[2:01:25] But when there's something different,
[2:01:26] SOMETHING OUTSTANDING WITH JEHOVAH'S
[2:01:28] blessing on it,
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; then they're scared to say anything.
[2:01:33] Long as they can see that POWER OF GOD
[2:01:35] WORKING, THE DEVIL'S GOT SENSE ENOUGH TO
[2:01:36] KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT. BUT WHEN HE KNOWS
[2:01:38] YOU'RE DEFEATED,
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; BOY, that's good. He turns every devil
[2:01:44] he can
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; loose on you. So here the champion
[2:01:49] stands. He can't even find the pillars
[2:01:52] to lean on. And here comes this little
[2:01:55] boy.
[2:01:57] This is just a small detail, but God
[2:02:00] burned this in my heart many years ago
[2:02:03] about 1991 or '92. He dropped an
[2:02:06] inspiration in my heart concerning this
[2:02:10] little boy. It's just a small detail
[2:02:13] just mentioned so briefly here. We don't
[2:02:15] even know his name. We don't even know
[2:02:18] Samson's mother's name either, by the
[2:02:20] way.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; But we know what an important role she
[2:02:22] played. This little boy, stay stay here
[2:02:25] just a moment. This little boy certainly
[2:02:28] played a small detail but with a great
[2:02:30] prophetic weight in this story.
[2:02:32] Scripture gives only one verse to the
[2:02:34] lad. But one verse, one verse
[2:02:38] changed the outcome.
[2:02:40] One verse made a difference
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; in the future of an entire nation.
[2:02:45] There's no name, no title, no lineage,
[2:02:49] no record of his anointing, his calling,
[2:02:53] his God, his faith, his religion. NOBODY
[2:02:56] KNOWS. Yet without him, Samson never
[2:02:59] reaches the pillars. Without him, the
[2:03:01] Philistine system never collapses.
[2:03:04] Without him, the story ends in
[2:03:06] humiliation instead of deliverance.
[2:03:09] Without who? The lad.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "The lad."
[2:03:13] God often hides his greatest end time
[2:03:16] instruments
[2:03:18] prophetically in small verses.
[2:03:22] Now I want to talk about for a moment
[2:03:24] who the lad is and who he's not. What
[2:03:26] the lad is not. He is not strong. He is
[2:03:30] not famous. He is not a judge. He is not
[2:03:33] anointed like Samson. He is not the
[2:03:36] chosen deliverer to begin the
[2:03:38] deliverance of Israel from the hands of
[2:03:40] the Philistines. But let me tell you
[2:03:42] what he is. He is available.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; He is obedient.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; He is aligned.
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; He's strategically placed. And he
[2:03:53] recognized something
[2:03:56] ABOUT SAMSON.
[2:03:58] BUT
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; HE KNEW SOMEHOW THAT WHATEVER HAD
[2:04:02] HAPPENED TO COST HIM HIS POWER.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; THERE HAD BEEN A MEASURABLE CHANGE IN
[2:04:09] HIS DEMEANOR THESE LAST FEW WEEKS.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; AND THAT LITTLE BOY DIDN'T WANT TO MISS
[2:04:14] IT.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; I'm taking a little license.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; Forgive me. We all do.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T WANT TO MISS IT. SO HE WENT
[2:04:23] WITH HIM FROM THE PRISON HOUSE TO THE TO
[2:04:26] THE PLACE OF CELEBRATION
[2:04:29] AND HE WAS JUST WAITING on on an
[2:04:31] instruction
[2:04:33] placed right beside him. GOD DOES NOT
[2:04:37] REQUIRE PROMINENCE
[2:04:40] TO POSITION SOMEONE PROPHETICALLY.
[2:04:44] ALL THAT IS NECESSARY TO BE POSITIONED
[2:04:47] PROPHETICALLY is obedience.
[2:04:50] This is a holy picture.
[2:04:52] of a remnant bride church in the last
[2:04:56] days.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; A remnant church is overlooked. It's
[2:05:01] underestimated.
[2:05:02] IT'S UNSELEELEBRATED.
[2:05:04] BUT IT'S divinely positioned.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; You see, the first thing they WANT TO
[2:05:08] KNOW, WHAT denomination are you?
[2:05:14] When we tell them we ain't got none,
[2:05:19] it gives away our hick our hickeyified
[2:05:22] selves, right?
[2:05:24] We don't have any. Not because we
[2:05:26] couldn't,
[2:05:29] BUT BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN THERE
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; and done that.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; All we got was a t-shirt.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; We didn't get any closer to God.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. man's rules, man's restrictions,
[2:05:44] man's uh political moves and maneuvers
[2:05:47] and didn't do anything for us.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; And so we CAME TO A PLACE WHERE WE WOULD
[2:05:52] RATHER STAND ALONE ON THE word
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; than in the crowd.
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; Sanctioned by the mother church.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; But there was a generational partnership
[2:06:03] that was forming that's very very
[2:06:05] important prophetically for the season
[2:06:07] that we're about to enter into. So hear
[2:06:10] this. I've been holding it for this
[2:06:11] moment.
[2:06:14] THERE'S A GENERATIONAL partnership that
[2:06:17] God is setting up right here in this
[2:06:20] hour with a generation
[2:06:24] that has seemingly passed their prime.
[2:06:30] And a generation that is not yet stepped
[2:06:33] into the fullness of their why, the
[2:06:37] reason why they were born. And yet both
[2:06:40] generations
[2:06:42] represent something that we can't move
[2:06:45] forward without.
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; We're stuck in history.
[2:06:51] We're doomed to repeat THE MISTAKES OF
[2:06:55] THE GENERATIONS BEFORE US. IF WE MISS
[2:06:58] this opportunity TO WATCH GOD FUSE
[2:07:03] TOGETHER THE WISDOM
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; OF A GENERATION THAT CAME OUT UNDER
[2:07:09] MOSES
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; AND A GENERATION THAT WILL GO IN. MY
[2:07:14] GOD, I felt that. Woo.
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; It's not about feeling, but I'm glad I
[2:07:20] still got my feeler.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; Some people may have lost theirs.
[2:07:25] IS A GENERATION THAT HAS BEEN THERE AND
[2:07:27] DONE THAT. A GENERATION WHO HAD WISDOM,
[2:07:29] a generation who has experience,
[2:07:35] a Moses generation
[2:07:38] AND A JOSHUA GENERATION THAT'S JUST
[2:07:41] EMERGING.
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; Some of US FEEL AS THOUGH WE'RE KIND OF
[2:07:47] CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE BETWEEN A MOSES
[2:07:49] GENERATION AND A JOSHUA GENERATION. I
[2:07:52] WANT DON'T WANT YOU TO SPEND one moment,
[2:07:55] forgive me for this lozenge.
[2:08:00] I DON'T WANT YOU TO SPEND ONE MOMENT
[2:08:01] WORRIED about
[2:08:03] am I of the older gen AM I OF THE MOSES
[2:08:06] GENERATION OR AM I OF the Joshua
[2:08:09] generation? BECAUSE REMEMBER JOSHUA
[2:08:12] HIMSELF
[2:08:14] was part of the Moses generation.
[2:08:17] Amen.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; Joshua and Caleb,
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; 12 went in.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; 12 came out. THAT'S
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; 10 CAME out with gripes.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; Two came out with grapes.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; God said, "I'M GOING TO USE those men."
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO USE A JOSHUA. I'M GOING TO
[2:08:37] USE EVEN A CALEB.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; THEY were of A DIFFERENT SPIRIT.
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE OF AN OLDER GENERATION, BUT
[2:08:43] THEY WERE OF A DIFFERENT SPIRIT. IF GOD
[2:08:46] SAID I'M GOING TO HAVE A MOUNTAIN, CALEB
[2:08:48] SAID I'M GOING TO HAVE A MOUNTAIN.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE IF I'M 80. I DON'T CARE IF
[2:08:53] I'M 90. I DON'T CARE IF I'M 100. IF GOD
[2:08:57] SAID HE'S GOING TO GIVE ME A MOUNTAIN,
[2:08:59] I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE UNTIL I GET MY
[2:09:01] MOUNTAIN.
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; So don't YOU WORRY
[2:09:06] ABOUT WHICH generation you're in.
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; SERVE GOD. DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO HELP
[2:09:12] THE synergy
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; that is forming BETWEEN A MOSES, A
[2:09:17] PEOPLE WHO CAME OUT UNDER A MOSES
[2:09:18] ministry
[2:09:20] and a people who will go in
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; under a Joshua ministry.
[2:09:28] Now, Brother Brandham tells us in his
[2:09:30] own commission, I don't fully understand
[2:09:34] everything about it.
[2:09:37] I understand by my own experience with
[2:09:41] this ministry,
[2:09:43] BY WHAT I SAW, BY WHAT I've heard, by
[2:09:46] where I've been, by who I've met, by the
[2:09:49] testimonies that I have been privileged
[2:09:52] to hear from eyewitnesses of what God
[2:09:55] did a generation ago. I believe with all
[2:09:58] my heart that a message came like a
[2:10:00] Moses message to deliver a people out
[2:10:03] from under the influence of of Egypt and
[2:10:06] to get them out there. And I believe
[2:10:09] that there was a time that the model had
[2:10:12] to shift.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; It had to shift. And so God allowed
[2:10:18] Listen, do you believe, let me ask you
[2:10:21] first before I go into this and close
[2:10:22] after a while. Do you believe that God
[2:10:25] is able to keep his man from falling? I
[2:10:28] just want to ask you, if God's put his
[2:10:30] hand on a man or a woman,
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; do you believe God's able to keep them
[2:10:34] from falling?
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; So do I. Then why did Moses fall?
[2:10:40] Why did Moses fail?
[2:10:43] Why, when God told him to speak to the
[2:10:46] rock,
[2:10:48] did he go back
[2:10:51] to the old model? Amen.
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; I hope you can hear this.
[2:10:57] It's not that GOD DIDN'T DO IT in the
[2:11:00] OLD MODEL. HE DID. HE TOLD HIM ONE TIME,
[2:11:02] "TAKE THAT STICK AND STRIKE THAT ROCK
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; AND OUT OF THAT ROCK LIVING water is
[2:11:08] going to flow and feed the and and give
[2:11:10] give water to the people." 1 Corinthians
[2:11:12] 10 tells us they all ate THE SAME
[2:11:15] SPIRITUAL MEAT and all drank from THE
[2:11:17] SAME SPIRITUAL ROCK. DRINK. THEY DRANK
[2:11:19] THE SPIRITUAL WATER THAT FLOWED FROM A
[2:11:22] SPIRITUAL ROCK
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; THAT FOLLOWED THEM. A ROCK. A ROCK THAT
[2:11:28] FOLLOWED THEM.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; You ever had a rock follow you? The
[2:11:32] children of Israel did.
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; And that rock, Paul didn't mention the
[2:11:37] words. HE SAID, "AND THAT ROCK THAT
[2:11:39] FOLLOWED THEM
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; WAS CHRIST."
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; What that looked like, I DON'T KNOW. BUT
[2:11:44] I JUST AM I'M a literalist when it comes
[2:11:47] to scripture. AND IF THE BIBLE SAID A
[2:11:49] ROCK FOLLOWED THEM,
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; IF THE BIBLE SAID THAT GOD REPRESENTED
[2:11:53] CHRIST IN A ROCK THAT FOLLOWED THEM,
[2:11:56] THEN I believe God REPRESENTED HIMSELF
[2:11:58] IN A ROCK, CALLED IT CHRIST, AND IT
[2:12:00] FOLLOWED THEM.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; I JUST believe that what it looked like,
[2:12:03] I don't know. But what I DO KNOW IS WHEN
[2:12:05] HE STRUCK THAT ROCK, WATER CAME UP.
[2:12:11] Did you know there are archaeologists,
[2:12:13] some doubt it, but there are
[2:12:15] archaeologists, real archaeologists, not
[2:12:17] not phony baloney,
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; Indiana Jones kind, but real kind, who
[2:12:24] believe that that rock has been found.
[2:12:27] I have pictures of it split right down
[2:12:30] the middle and they believe that that is
[2:12:33] the rock. I don't know. They believe God
[2:12:35] left that image there to I don't know. I
[2:12:38] wasn't there. But I know that when he
[2:12:40] struck the rock, guess what God told him
[2:12:43] to do? He did it. And God honored that.
[2:12:46] And I know that there should have been
[2:12:47] no water in that rock, but God placed it
[2:12:49] there. And it come down rushing down off
[2:12:51] that mountain and gave the people what
[2:12:53] they needed.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; There came another time that they needed
[2:12:56] water, and God told Moses to do what?
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; Speak to the rock. But what did Mo are
[2:13:02] you still with me? Yes, sir.
[2:13:06] Is your uh Pop-Tart run out on you?
[2:13:13] Well, then you ought to have had
[2:13:13] something more than a Pop-Tart.
[2:13:20] You better hear this.
[2:13:23] We're just now getting to something.
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; It's powerful for me.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; I'll just keep it to myself. That's
[2:13:30] okay.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; It blessed me enough
[2:13:34] So what did he do? He he he was
[2:13:37] frustrated.
[2:13:40] He'd had enough.
[2:13:43] God had given them everything they
[2:13:44] needed. He had followed those precious
[2:13:46] children provided. Did you know for 40
[2:13:50] years they didn't need to go to Walmart
[2:13:52] and buy a new a new pair of pants?
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; The Bible said for 40 years their
[2:14:00] clothes grew. I wish mom would have
[2:14:01] grudged with me all these years. I could
[2:14:04] have a big closet
[2:14:07] empty
[2:14:09] instead of 15 different sizes. My
[2:14:11] clothes didn't grow with me. They didn't
[2:14:13] shrink with me. If I ever shrunk a time
[2:14:15] or two, I did.
[2:14:17] But theirs grew with them. Their shoes
[2:14:19] never wore out.
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; They didn't have Allen Edmonds in.
[2:14:25] And they they served them well because
[2:14:28] God was getting them from one point to
[2:14:29] the next. And yet they belly achd and
[2:14:32] they complained and they murmured
[2:14:34] against Moses. Come on.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; Mocked his choice of a wife. And on and
[2:14:40] on and on and on and on it went. AND GOD
[2:14:43] KEPT MEETING THEM. And God kept honoring
[2:14:45] them. AND ONE DAY GOD SAID, "MOSES,
[2:14:47] SPEAK TO THE ROCK.
[2:14:50] GOD WAS GETTING READY TO INTRODUCE
[2:14:53] A DIFFERENT MODEL.
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; SAME GOD, SAME POWER, SAME RESULTS."
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; WATER from a rock.
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. WATER FROM A ROCK. SAME
[2:15:01] RESULTS. Water from a rock,
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; but a new model
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; for how to get that water out of the
[2:15:07] rock.
[2:15:08] &gt;&gt; Why cry?
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "WHY CRY? SPEAK TO THAT ROCK."
[2:15:16] And Moses had had all he could take. And
[2:15:18] all he could see
[2:15:20] was what looked like two-headed people
[2:15:22] to him.
[2:15:24] He looked out across that congregation
[2:15:27] and he had become so disappointed and so
[2:15:31] frustrated and so uh carnal. I'm not
[2:15:35] defending him. Although as a pastor,
[2:15:40] I want to
[2:15:42] I feel a little bit sorry for him.
[2:15:46] I pray I hadn't got that far.
[2:15:50] But instead, God said, "SPEAK TO THE
[2:15:52] ROCK." And it wasn't that Moses didn't
[2:15:55] believe God would do it, but he was
[2:15:58] stuck
[2:16:00] as as ordained to be stuck in the old
[2:16:04] model.
[2:16:06] And so he I know I he said, "I DON'T
[2:16:08] KNOW ABOUT THIS VEGAN, BUT I KNOW ABOUT
[2:16:10] THE STRIKING."
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; SO HE STRUCK THE ROCK AND guess what
[2:16:14] happened? If I'd have wrote the book,
[2:16:16] I'd have said no water came.
[2:16:20] If it WOULD HAVE BEEN ME THAT DAY, I
[2:16:22] WOULD HAVE SAID, "NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
[2:16:24] NO, MOSES. I DON'T CARE HOW UPSET YOU
[2:16:26] ARE. I TOLD YOU TO SPEAK.
[2:16:31] NOW, you don't have to HAVE NO WATER,
[2:16:33] BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE THIRSTY. NOW YOU DO
[2:16:35] WHAT I TELL YOU TO DO, AND you speak to
[2:16:37] that, and I'll feed all of you, and if
[2:16:39] there's any left, you can have a sip."
[2:16:41] That's how I'd have DONE IT. BUT GOD
[2:16:43] SAID, "NO, I'M NOT GOING TO EMBARRASS MY
[2:16:46] servant
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; in front of those PEOPLE BECAUSE HE HAS
[2:16:50] PROVEN FAITHFUL AND HE HAS DONE WHAT
[2:16:52] I'VE CALLED HIM TO DO THESE many years.
[2:16:54] I'M GOING TO HONOR HIM BY LETTING WATER
[2:16:57] COME OUT OF THAT ROCK. BUT I'M GOING TO
[2:16:59] DEAL WITH him
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; at another time."
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; Did he?
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; He took Moses up on the mountain,
[2:17:07] Nebo, wasn't it?
[2:17:10] And he said, 'I want you to look out
[2:17:12] over that land. That's the promised
[2:17:14] land. 40 long years you've wandered in
[2:17:17] the wilderness to get these people from
[2:17:19] here to there. Look how close it really
[2:17:21] was.
[2:17:23] You couldn't tell from down there in the
[2:17:24] valley how close you were. YOU WERE
[2:17:26] ALMOST THERE. BUT YOU DIDN'T OBEY ME,
[2:17:29] MOSES. AND BECAUSE OF THAT, I'M GOING TO
[2:17:31] LET YOU SEE IT.
[2:17:37] But you're not ever going to be able to
[2:17:38] walk in it.
[2:17:43] In fact, we don't know that he ever
[2:17:46] there there's great dispute
[2:17:49] over what even happened to his body.
[2:17:52] It's almost as though the Lord just
[2:17:54] somehow
[2:17:56] at some point just took him.
[2:18:00] Did was he lost? Never. Is he in
[2:18:04] eternity? Absolutely. Are you going to
[2:18:06] see Moses? Yes. And don't call him Santa
[2:18:08] Claus.
[2:18:11] Cuz he's not. Did he make it all the
[2:18:14] way? 100%.
[2:18:17] How did he do it? Because he was waiting
[2:18:19] in in paradise.
[2:18:24] The Bible talks about it. Do I need to
[2:18:26] repreach that? No.
[2:18:28] The Bible tells us.
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; He goes down, his body laying in the
[2:18:33] grave. His spirit man goes down into the
[2:18:35] heart of the earth
[2:18:38] into that place that we understand to be
[2:18:42] called paradise where there's a gulix
[2:18:44] between it and Gehenna
[2:18:49] or hell
[2:18:51] and the righteous dead were in that
[2:18:54] place until Christ descended into the
[2:18:57] heart of the earth at his crucifixion.
[2:18:59] And as he made his appearance, they
[2:19:02] began to recognize
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM SAID, "HE LOOKS A WHOLE LOT LIKE
[2:19:09] THE ONE I'VE PAID TITHES TO."
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; SHEDRACH, MACH, AND ABEDNEGO SAID, "LOOK
[2:19:15] THERE. HE LOOKS LIKE THE FOURTH MAN IN
[2:19:19] THE FIRE."
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; DANIEL SAID, "OH MY, HE'S THE ONE THAT
[2:19:24] WALKED ALL AROUND THE LION'S DEN."
[2:19:26] ABRAHAM
[2:19:28] AND SARAH SAID, "WE KNOW HIM. HE VISITED
[2:19:32] US IN OUR TENT."
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; AND DAVID SAID, "I SAW HIM IN THE
[2:19:38] MOUNTAINS OF JUDEA.
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; I HEARD HIM TALK TO ME IN THE BABBLING
[2:19:44] BROOK.
[2:19:46] I FELT HIS EMBRACE WHEN I LAY IN THE
[2:19:49] GRASS
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; OF PSALM 23." And on and on and on and
[2:19:53] on and on and on. And Moses said, "There
[2:19:56] he is the rock."
[2:19:59] THERE HE IS. THE ROCK THAT FOLLOWED US.
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE OF THAT, they accepted him
[2:20:08] to be what he said he was, Messiah,
[2:20:11] King, and Lord.
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; And the Bible said that he led
[2:20:18] captivity
[2:20:19] captive.
[2:20:21] He took those who could not inherit an
[2:20:26] eternal kingdom beyond because they did
[2:20:28] not have the blood of Jesus applied to
[2:20:31] their life.
[2:20:33] And uh in spite of what you read,
[2:20:36] there is no one in that dimension with
[2:20:41] eternal life except those who have been
[2:20:45] redeemed
[2:20:46] by the blood of the lamb, by the grace
[2:20:48] of God and by the blood of the lamb. You
[2:20:51] won't meet one person there who is there
[2:20:54] with eternal life because they brought
[2:20:57] you uh something good. They were good to
[2:20:59] the bride. That's what they like to say.
[2:21:01] And they use this verse where Jesus
[2:21:04] said, "That that you've done under the
[2:21:05] least of my little ones, that you've
[2:21:07] done also to me." He said that and he
[2:21:10] meant it.
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; And when you're good to somebody, WHEN
[2:21:13] YOU TREAT PEOPLE RIGHT, IT IS AS THOUGH
[2:21:15] YOU'RE treating God's people, YOU TREAT
[2:21:18] GOD'S PEOPLE RIGHT, IT IS AS THOUGH
[2:21:19] YOU'RE TREATING GOD RIGHT. NO PROBLEM.
[2:21:21] BUT THERE IS NO WAY THAT YOU CAN THEN BE
[2:21:24] GIVEN AS A REWARD ETERNAL LIFE
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU'VE been good to a member of
[2:21:28] the bride. THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO MAKE
[2:21:30] IT. MOSES FOUND OUT. ABRAHAM FOUND OUT.
[2:21:33] DANIEL FOUND OUT. ADAM AND EVE FOUND
[2:21:36] OUT.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; AND there's going to be a whole lot of
[2:21:39] message folk find out.
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; And they had to come that same way you
[2:21:44] came.
[2:21:45] &gt;&gt; And boy, when they realized who he was,
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; WOO. HAVE MERCY ON US.
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; THOU SON OF DAVID,
[2:21:54] can you imagine David
[2:21:58] CRYING OUT, "HAVE MERCY ON US. THOU SON
[2:22:00] OF DAVID. OH, JUST THINK ABOUT IT,
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; MY GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT HAVE MERCY.
[2:22:07] And he did. And he led them out of
[2:22:09] paradise. He emptied paradise. I'm still
[2:22:12] preaching.
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; He emptied out paradise. And the Bible
[2:22:15] said he took them all the way out from
[2:22:16] the heart of the earth. And the and the
[2:22:18] Bible tells us in the New Testament that
[2:22:20] when that veil was rent and twained, the
[2:22:23] earth shook. And it said, "And many of
[2:22:24] the saints which slept arose and walked
[2:22:26] again the streets of Jerusalem." Amen.
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; Wasn't just a resurrection of one man.
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; It actually called a a a generational uh
[2:22:34] resurrection. Hallelujah.
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; And when he ascended, they could go with
[2:22:39] him.
[2:22:40] &gt;&gt; SO EVEN MOSES HAD TO COME BY THE BLOOD.
[2:22:43] &gt;&gt; AND ABRAHAM had to come by the blood.
[2:22:45] How could you possibly think that you
[2:22:47] could sneak in the back door?
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Without the blood. uh they had to
[2:22:53] come up with such an idea because uh
[2:22:55] they wanted to narrow the whole
[2:22:57] salvation thing down and say the only
[2:22:59] way you can have eternal life is to
[2:23:01] believe a prophet or to name him a name
[2:23:03] or to understand a messenger to an age
[2:23:05] and that is contrary to the word. The
[2:23:07] Bible said uh whosoever whosoever
[2:23:10] calleth upon the name of the Lord
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; shall be saved.
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; You mean you can go to heaven without
[2:23:19] knowing who my pastor is? Yes. You mean
[2:23:22] you mean you can go to heaven without
[2:23:23] knowing who the last prophet and his
[2:23:25] name? Absolutely. It's saved. Call on
[2:23:27] the name of the Lord.
[2:23:32] &gt;&gt; Well, let God sort out whose bride and
[2:23:34] who's overcomer and who's not. But but
[2:23:36] I'll tell you, eternal life is eternal
[2:23:38] life.
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; Anybody with me? Yes, sir.
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; So, here was Moses representing an old
[2:23:43] order. And here was a Joshua. But Joshua
[2:23:45] was a part of the same generation.
[2:23:48] And yet the ministry model of Moses WAS
[2:23:51] COMING TO AN END AND A NEW MINISTRY
[2:23:53] model was being introduced and THAT
[2:23:54] WOULD BE UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF JOSHUA.
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; And I want you to look real quick WHAT
[2:23:59] GOD SAID BECAUSE THIS is a
[2:24:01] representation of the shift
[2:24:04] THAT RAISED A LITTLE lad
[2:24:07] to put Samson back in his position for
[2:24:11] one last great move of God.
[2:24:17] It's the bride's revival. Joshua 1:1.
[2:24:20] Now after the death of Moses, and I'll
[2:24:22] I'll just have to stop in a minute. Now
[2:24:25] after the death of Moses, a servant of
[2:24:27] the Lord, it came to pass that the Lord
[2:24:29] spake unto Joshua the son of Non. Moses
[2:24:32] minister, saying, Moses, my servant is
[2:24:35] dead. Now therefore arise and go over
[2:24:37] this Jordan thou and all this people
[2:24:40] unto the land which I do give to them
[2:24:43] even to the children of Israel. Every
[2:24:45] place that the soul of your foot shall
[2:24:46] tread upon I have given unto you as I
[2:24:50] said.
[2:24:52] MOSES DIDN'T DO IT.
[2:24:54] BUT AS I SAID to Moses, for the wild
[2:24:58] from the wilderness and the Lebanon,
[2:25:00] even under the great river, the river
[2:25:01] Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites,
[2:25:03] and under the great sea, toward the
[2:25:05] going down of the sun, all the way west
[2:25:07] shall be your coast. There shall not any
[2:25:09] man be able to stand before thee all the
[2:25:10] days OF THY LIFE. AS I WAS with Moses,
[2:25:15] so I will be with thee. I will not fail
[2:25:18] thee, nor forsake thee. Now, don't you
[2:25:20] go out of here thinking I'm preaching
[2:25:21] that there will be a one-man Joshua
[2:25:23] ministry. Absolutely not. That would be
[2:25:26] a repeat of the old model.
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; The new model will not be a repeat OF
[2:25:30] THE OLD MODEL. THE NEW MODEL WILL BE A
[2:25:32] GENERATIONAL PEOPLE.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:25:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:25:37] &gt;&gt; A JOSHUA GENERATION.
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; WHO WILL WALK SOFTLY BEFORE THE LORD.
[2:25:47] AND IF HE SAID SPEAK TO THE ROCK,
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; GUESS WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO?
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SPEAK TO THE
[2:25:53] ROCK.
[2:25:57] &gt;&gt; And they're going to get in a lot of
[2:25:58] trouble
[2:26:01] if all they do is go back through and
[2:26:03] try to figure out. Now, let's see how
[2:26:04] Moses did this. Let me let me see.
[2:26:08] Now, Moses said any gift ought to
[2:26:10] operate in a in a back room. and and
[2:26:13] Moses said that Moses said three three
[2:26:16] hymns and turn off the lights and and
[2:26:18] Moses said it.
[2:26:21] &gt;&gt; Some of you don't know where I am, but
[2:26:23] some of you do.
[2:26:27] &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean that we ignore the
[2:26:29] word that was delivered to us by Moses
[2:26:32] generation and Moses ministry.
[2:26:33] Absolutely not. Because he said you I'm
[2:26:36] going to be faithful to you, but you've
[2:26:37] got to stay faithful to what I said to
[2:26:39] Moses.
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; Come on now. He said, "Thou shalt there
[2:26:43] shall not any man be able to stand
[2:26:44] before thee all the days of thy life. As
[2:26:46] I was with Moses, so I will be with
[2:26:48] thee. I will not fail thee, NOR FORSAKE
[2:26:50] THEE. BE STRONG
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; AND OF A GOOD COURAGE."
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; YES.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; Can I have 10 more? THANK YOU.
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; GOOD COURAGE FOR UNTO THIS PEOPLE SHALT
[2:26:59] THOU DIVIDE FOR AN INHERITANCE the land
[2:27:01] which I swear unto their fathers to give
[2:27:03] them. Only be thou strong. You know
[2:27:05] what? God knew. God knew. God knew. God
[2:27:09] knew that it was going to be A BURDEN
[2:27:11] FOR JOSHUA to live
[2:27:14] under the reputation,
[2:27:18] &gt;&gt; under the expectation
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; of a Moses ministry.
[2:27:23] &gt;&gt; And so he kept telling him, "I'll be
[2:27:24] with you. I'll never leave you. Be
[2:27:26] strong and be very courageous. Be
[2:27:28] strong. Be very courageous. Be strong.
[2:27:34] Cuz there's going to be some old-timers
[2:27:35] out there that'll try to crucify you
[2:27:38] &gt;&gt; or taking us anywhere,
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; They'd rather stay right here on this
[2:27:42] side of the Jordan,
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; Clinging to an old model,
[2:27:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:27:49] &gt;&gt; When God said, "Your inheritance is not
[2:27:50] on this side.
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; Your inheritance is on that side." And
[2:27:54] you're going to have to have some power
[2:27:56] with God because when you get over
[2:27:57] there, you're going to meet the enemy,
[2:27:59] and you're going to have to dispossess
[2:28:00] him to inherit your promise. I DIDN'T
[2:28:02] CLEAR IT OUT for you.
[2:28:04] &gt;&gt; In order to get it and keep it and have
[2:28:06] it as your own, you're going to HAVE TO
[2:28:07] GET RID OF THE SQUATTERS.
[2:28:11] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:28:13] Be thou strong and very courageous that
[2:28:15] thou mayest observe to do according to
[2:28:16] all the law which Moses my servant
[2:28:18] commanded thee. Turn not from it
[2:28:21] to the right hand or to the left that
[2:28:23] thou mayest prosper whethersoever thou
[2:28:25] goest. See, some things are thus sayeth
[2:28:27] the Lord, and some things are the word
[2:28:29] of the Lord, and other things represent
[2:28:32] a ministry model.
[2:28:35] &gt;&gt; To think that everybody has to have an
[2:28:37] eagle belt buckle
[2:28:39] would be following a ministry model.
[2:28:44] &gt;&gt; To think that everybody has to like
[2:28:46] eagles
[2:28:47] would be following a ministry model.
[2:28:50] to think everybody has to live in Tucson
[2:28:53] or Jeffersonville
[2:28:55] &gt;&gt; would be following a ministry model
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; that you don't have to keep that you
[2:29:00] don't have to follow but that word
[2:29:04] &gt;&gt; that word that you take back and lay in
[2:29:06] the absolute
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; you're not worried about what Moses did
[2:29:14] or what his children did or what his
[2:29:17] wife did
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; Africa
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; or what he wore in Africa, right?
[2:29:25] &gt;&gt; Or whether he could count birds or not.
[2:29:29] That don't matter.
[2:29:33] You're not following that ministry
[2:29:35] model, but you're following that
[2:29:36] dovetail of the word.
[2:29:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:38] &gt;&gt; He said that uh you say with that may
[2:29:40] observe to do according to all the law
[2:29:42] which Moses my servant commanded thee.
[2:29:43] turn not from it to the right hand or to
[2:29:45] the left, that thou mayest prosper
[2:29:47] whethersoever thou goest. Listen, this
[2:29:50] book of the law shall not depart out of
[2:29:52] thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate
[2:29:53] therein day and night, that thou mayest
[2:29:55] observe to do according to all that is
[2:29:56] written therein. For then thou shalt
[2:29:58] make thy way. Thou shalt MAKE THY WAY.
[2:30:01] THOU THOU SHALL MAKE THY WAY.
[2:30:05] HE DIDN'T SAY, I'M GOING TO MAKE IT
[2:30:07] PROSPEROUS. HE SAID, "YOU OBEY THE WORD
[2:30:09] AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE MAKING your way
[2:30:11] prosperous because you'll have the
[2:30:13] blessing and the favor of the LORD AND
[2:30:15] THEN THOU SHALT HAVE.
[2:30:18] Have not I commanded thee? Be strong."
[2:30:19] Here we go again. It wasn't that Joshua
[2:30:22] was a wimp.
[2:30:25] It was that God knew the challenge
[2:30:28] that lay ahead.
[2:30:30] And Joshua had been a follower and now
[2:30:34] he was going to have to be a leader. And
[2:30:36] it was going to cost him something
[2:30:38] because he was going to have to look as
[2:30:41] though he was fighting
[2:30:44] an old order
[2:30:47] to be able to shift the mindset
[2:30:51] for a new model.
[2:30:53] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I don't even know what
[2:30:54] you're It's a third pull model.
[2:31:00] &gt;&gt; It's a It's an entirely It's a third
[2:31:02] pull model. It comes by the authority of
[2:31:04] the spoken word. Yes.
[2:31:06] &gt;&gt; You see, I happen to believe that before
[2:31:08] we get out of here, there will be there
[2:31:10] will be a quick short period of time
[2:31:11] where we don't have to anoint with oil
[2:31:13] and lay hands on the sick and shake the
[2:31:16] heavens to believe. I have to believe
[2:31:18] that if this follows the pattern that
[2:31:19] the scripture has laid out for us that
[2:31:22] there will be an hour of authority just
[2:31:24] before the rapture of the bride and she
[2:31:26] will SPEAK
[2:31:28] &gt;&gt; AND IT WON'T JUST BE HER. IT'LL BE HER
[2:31:31] PAPA BACKING UP
[2:31:34] &gt;&gt; THE BRIDEGROOM,
[2:31:36] &gt;&gt; SPEAKING HIS VOICE THROUGH THE BRIDE,
[2:31:40] &gt;&gt; and not even cancer would be able to
[2:31:42] stand in the way of that voice. Have not
[2:31:44] I commanded thee? Be strong and of good
[2:31:45] courage. Be not afraid, neither be thou
[2:31:47] dismayed, for the Lord thy God is with
[2:31:49] thee, whethersoever thou. Now, musicians
[2:31:53] are coming.
[2:31:56] I I didn't finish with a little lad, but
[2:31:59] I will.
[2:32:01] I I think I've I think I can squeeze out
[2:32:03] a few more on Samson. I THOUGHT YOU'D
[2:32:06] LEFT TO GO TO MOSES AND JOSHUA. OH, NO.
[2:32:09] I'm coming back.
[2:32:11] God talked to Moses. Let me give you
[2:32:14] these few paragraphs and be done.
[2:32:19] I didn't read as much as I did last
[2:32:22] Sunday, so don't murmur.
[2:32:25] Paragraph 23.
[2:32:28] Moses was a type of the church. Look,
[2:32:30] like I've said before, if I thought we
[2:32:32] were all hearing it like we needed to
[2:32:34] hear it or or reading it like we need to
[2:32:38] read it, well then I could just find
[2:32:40] something else to say. Moses was a type
[2:32:43] of the church. Listen carefully to this.
[2:32:45] Moses was a type of the church,
[2:32:49] a type of the organization,
[2:32:52] the law.
[2:32:54] But Moses glorified himself
[2:33:01] and instead of glorifying God as a
[2:33:04] perfect type.
[2:33:09] Now, somebody said, "I got a little
[2:33:10] problem with that." You can't. You can
[2:33:12] have a problem with that because that's
[2:33:14] exactly what happened.
[2:33:19] There was no sin involved in this. The
[2:33:23] glory just shifted.
[2:33:28] And God is jealous.
[2:33:31] Somebody said, "I can't believe you just
[2:33:32] said that." Oh, the Bible did. He's a
[2:33:35] jealous God.
[2:33:37] &gt;&gt; He wants our love and our obedience, and
[2:33:39] he wants our praise, and he he doesn't
[2:33:41] want us giving uh all of our praise and
[2:33:44] attention and confidence to men.
[2:33:47] He wants us to understand that men are
[2:33:50] part of that resurrection gift. Uh it
[2:33:53] said he he led captivity captive and did
[2:33:55] what? Gave gifts unto men. And those are
[2:33:58] the ascension gifts. And there are five
[2:34:00] of them. Apostles, prophets, pastors,
[2:34:02] teachers, and evangelists. And there are
[2:34:04] nine gifts of the spirit in the book of
[2:34:06] first Corinthians. Nine gifts of the
[2:34:08] spirit and five ascension gifts.
[2:34:12] Apostle, pastor,
[2:34:14] you heard it. You know it.
[2:34:18] We can't forget it. So when Moses
[2:34:23] struck that rock, when God said speak to
[2:34:25] that rock,
[2:34:28] he wasn't setting the example that was
[2:34:31] going to be necessary
[2:34:33] to take those people all the way.
[2:34:38] And so this is what he tells us.
[2:34:41] There could have been a perfect type if
[2:34:44] he would have spoke to the rock. There
[2:34:47] could have been a perfect type. In other
[2:34:48] places, he tells us that by doing so, by
[2:34:51] doing what he did, by striking the rock
[2:34:53] the second time, he took the whole
[2:34:54] pattern of God out of Kater.
[2:34:58] &gt;&gt; You you educated folk understand what
[2:35:00] that means. It takes them out of cater.
[2:35:03] He said there was no need for Christ to
[2:35:07] be struck the second time. He died once
[2:35:11] &gt;&gt; for all.
[2:35:14] &gt;&gt; And by striking that rock the second
[2:35:16] time, it wasn't just Moses frustrated.
[2:35:18] But by doing that, he he broke the
[2:35:21] continuity
[2:35:24] of the program and pattern of God. God
[2:35:26] honored it. God gave the people water.
[2:35:29] Moses wasn't able to inherit the
[2:35:31] promised land. But don't you think for
[2:35:33] one minute that he lost his eternal
[2:35:35] purpose with God?
[2:35:37] But God is a jealous God. Just make sure
[2:35:39] I get all this out so that you don't
[2:35:41] misunderstand what I'm saying before
[2:35:43] they crossed over. Let me read it from
[2:35:46] the beginning since I botched it with
[2:35:48] all my commentary. Moses was a type of
[2:35:50] the church, a type of the organization,
[2:35:52] the law. But Moses glorified himself
[2:35:54] instead of glorifying God as a perfect
[2:35:56] type. He didn't mean to do that. THAT
[2:35:58] WASN'T WHY HE DID IT. HE WASN'T TRYING
[2:36:00] TO GET THE GLORY.
[2:36:02] BUT BY STRIKING THE ROCK WHEN THE PEOPLE
[2:36:04] UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE SOMETHING IS
[2:36:06] SHIFTING HERE THEY DIDN'T understand
[2:36:08] what it WAS ALL ABOUT BUT THEY MUST HAVE
[2:36:09] KNOWN SOMETHING WAS GOING SOMETHING FELT
[2:36:12] different this time and here he went
[2:36:14] right back and did it the same way and
[2:36:16] therefore he got the attention of the
[2:36:18] people and this was supposed to go only
[2:36:20] to God because it was going to be God's
[2:36:22] authority in the mouth of the prophet
[2:36:24] which would represent God's authority in
[2:36:26] the mouth of the bride
[2:36:28] &gt;&gt; that's part of mine and your pattern
[2:36:30] &gt;&gt; hello
[2:36:33] as a perfect type. I just did it again.
[2:36:37] Lord, please help me not to have
[2:36:38] commentary.
[2:36:40] Moses was a type of the church, a type
[2:36:42] of the organization, the law. But Moses
[2:36:43] glorified himself and instead of
[2:36:45] glorifying God as a perfect type before
[2:36:47] they crossed over into the promised
[2:36:49] land. And that's just exactly what
[2:36:51] Methodists, Baptist, Presbyterian,
[2:36:53] Pentecostals,
[2:36:55] Lutheran,
[2:36:56] and all all of us, all of us had done
[2:36:59] the same thing.
[2:37:01] They are seeing who can have the biggest
[2:37:03] crowd or the best dress or the biggest
[2:37:05] church or the finest pews. They're
[2:37:07] trying to glorify their organization
[2:37:09] until God moved out.
[2:37:14] &gt;&gt; And today, the very signs and wonders
[2:37:15] and phenomenals that's been in the
[2:37:17] church every time they had a revival
[2:37:19] through any age, these signs has broke
[2:37:21] out in the church. Hallelujah. So, Dr.
[2:37:24] Scoffield, you can take your commentary
[2:37:26] wherever you want to take it. But it
[2:37:28] must have been inspired because God's
[2:37:30] done it in every generation. He sent
[2:37:32] signs and wonders to follow the people
[2:37:33] of God. So it must have been inspired
[2:37:35] after all, sir.
[2:37:41] And they've been all down through all
[2:37:42] these church ages just like Joshua come
[2:37:44] with Moses all the way through.
[2:37:47] He wasn't he wasn't somebody that just
[2:37:49] stepped on the scene. He came all the
[2:37:51] way through under the ministry model of
[2:37:53] Moses. BUT THE CHURCH AIN'T CEASED with
[2:37:56] Moses.
[2:38:02] And Joshua took the children of God into
[2:38:05] the promised land,
[2:38:09] which tells me that the ministry model
[2:38:11] had to shift
[2:38:14] for the Israelites, for the bride, we're
[2:38:16] saying, to inherit the promise. So God
[2:38:20] didn't make a mistake and no drunk
[2:38:21] driver took Moses. No drunk driver took
[2:38:23] the prophet. and and and Moses you
[2:38:26] didn't die lost in the wilderness and
[2:38:29] it was all part of the plan and I
[2:38:32] believe that that age has come now the
[2:38:33] miraculous the phenomenal the baptism of
[2:38:35] the spirit and power and signs and
[2:38:37] wonders this great pouring out of God's
[2:38:38] spirit in the last days and that's a
[2:38:40] thing that'll bring faith into the
[2:38:41] people that'll take a rapturing faith
[2:38:44] that'll take the church into GLORY I
[2:38:45] BELIEVE IT HERE I BELIEVE IT TOO BUT
[2:38:47] THAT WAS 60 YEARS AGO AMEN.
[2:38:55] &gt;&gt; 60 years ago.
[2:39:00] &gt;&gt; I'M TALKING ABOUT HIS MINISTRY. I WAS
[2:39:02] LOOKING AT THE DATE OF THIS SERMON.
[2:39:04] That would be many more.
[2:39:08] If 65 WAS THE END OF HIS MINISTRY,
[2:39:12] THEN WE LOOK BACK AT THAT AND WE SAY,
[2:39:14] "WHERE IS THE RAPTURING?" OH, WE'VE GOT
[2:39:17] IT. WE'VE GOT IT. YOU SAY, "WE'VE GOT
[2:39:19] THE RAPTURING FAITH." OH, WE HAVE THE
[2:39:21] RAPTURING FAITH. THEN WHAT ARE WE STILL
[2:39:24] DOING HERE LIVING IN SATAN'S EDEN?
[2:39:27] &gt;&gt; IF WE HAVE THE FAITH TO MAKE A RAPTURE,
[2:39:29] WHY HADN'T SOMEBODY MADE ONE ALREADY?
[2:39:31] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:39:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:35] &gt;&gt; Because there's a pattern and a program
[2:39:37] that's that's in this book, and we're
[2:39:39] not going to bend it. Moses couldn't
[2:39:41] bend it.
[2:39:42] &gt;&gt; THE PENTECOSTALS COULDN'T BEND IT.
[2:39:44] &gt;&gt; THE CATHOLICS COULDN'T BEND IT. AND
[2:39:47] WE'LL not be able to bend it either.
[2:39:48] We're going to have to follow the
[2:39:49] program all the way through. How can the
[2:39:52] church be raptured when we haven't even
[2:39:54] got FAITH FOR HEALING? THERE WAS FAITH
[2:39:56] FOR HEALING IN THE 50S AND 60S.
[2:39:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:40:00] &gt;&gt; THE RESTORATION MESSAGE CAME, RESTORED
[2:40:03] FAITH FOR HEALING, AND WHERE IS IT now
[2:40:05] 60 years later? Oh, they've got one
[2:40:07] little favorite quote.
[2:40:10] And the bride is just laying ripening
[2:40:14] in the presence of the sun.
[2:40:22] Nobody's buying it.
[2:40:24] There's got to be more. God has to
[2:40:27] finish his plan.
[2:40:29] There's no order in this word that says
[2:40:32] there's going to be a crippled, broken
[2:40:34] down, defeated, powerless, blind,
[2:40:38] &gt;&gt; baldheaded
[2:40:40] &gt;&gt; church like Samson.
[2:40:43] &gt;&gt; Forgive me, folks. Forgive me. Forgive
[2:40:44] me, BROTHERS.
[2:40:46] &gt;&gt; IN THE LAST DAYS,
[2:40:48] &gt;&gt; THERE'S AN order here.
[2:40:51] &gt;&gt; There's got to be then. THEN WHAT DO WE
[2:40:53] HAVE TO HAVE? WE HAVE TO HAVE A BREATH.
[2:40:56] WE HAVE TO HAVE A BREATH OF GOD'S WIND.
[2:40:59] AND THERE'S A FEW OTHER THINGS THAT
[2:41:00] WE'VE GOT TO GRAB A HOLD OF AND
[2:41:02] UNDERSTAND BY REVELATION BECAUSE THE
[2:41:05] JOSHUA MINISTRY CANNOT OPERATE UNDER THE
[2:41:07] ORDER OF A THIRD PULL WHEN WE DON'T EVEN
[2:41:10] UNDERSTAND ALL THAT WAS REPRESENTED IN
[2:41:12] THAT THIRD POOL.
[2:41:14] &gt;&gt; AND WE CAN'T HAVE WHAT WAS RELEASED IN
[2:41:16] THOSE SEALS UNTIL WE HAVE UNDERSTANDING.
[2:41:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:41:21] AND DON'T TELL ME IT WAS JUST VIRTUES
[2:41:23] BECAUSE IF THE THUNDERS WERE ONLY ABOUT
[2:41:25] THE VIRTUES, WE GOT THEM IN THE CHURCH
[2:41:28] AGES. THE RAPTURE COULD HAVE HAPPENED IN
[2:41:31] THE 50S.
[2:41:33] &gt;&gt; But here we are.
[2:41:35] &gt;&gt; 2026.
[2:41:37] I know some of you are lost. I don't
[2:41:38] like to do that when there may be a
[2:41:40] visitor that doesn't know all that we're
[2:41:42] referring to. That's why I'm done. But I
[2:41:45] just need to tell those of you who do
[2:41:47] know and who have been following this
[2:41:49] plan of thought for so many years now,
[2:41:52] something
[2:41:54] third seal message. He said, "The bride
[2:41:56] has never had a revival yet.
[2:41:58] &gt;&gt; It's going to take something to wake her
[2:42:00] up. It's going to take the revelation of
[2:42:01] those seven unknown thunders." All
[2:42:02] right, brother Jackson says that's seven
[2:42:04] men. Where are they? Let's get them
[2:42:06] here. All the seven men he picked in the
[2:42:07] 50s are dead.
[2:42:10] 60S DEAD. 70S ARE DEAD.
[2:42:14] SO, WE CAN'T WAIT ON THEM ANYMORE. And
[2:42:17] if IT WAS JUST THE VIRTUES, AS BROTHER
[2:42:18] COLEMAN PREACHED ALL OVER THE WORLD,
[2:42:20] HE'S GONE NOW. AND WHY DID GOD HAVE TO
[2:42:22] DO THE THUNDER? RELEASE THE THE THE THE
[2:42:26] UH VIRTUES
[2:42:27] IN THE THUNDERS when they had already
[2:42:30] been brought forth.
[2:42:36] We've got to make a little sense here.
[2:42:38] Let's go on. How can the church be
[2:42:41] raptured? We haven't got faith for
[2:42:42] healing. We've got to have rapturing
[2:42:43] faith first. How the how that God moves
[2:42:46] by his spirit, signs and wonders.
[2:42:50] &gt;&gt; He's talking about rapturing faith and
[2:42:52] signs and wonders. Isn't that crazy?
[2:42:55] Because they're putting signs and
[2:42:57] wonders so far back that they're ought
[2:42:58] to be over by now and rapturing faith
[2:43:00] out here. But he puts them right there
[2:43:02] together. How that God moves by his
[2:43:03] spirit. Signs and wonders begin to
[2:43:04] follow. Everywhere God begins to move,
[2:43:06] signs and wonders does what?
[2:43:08] &gt;&gt; Follow.
[2:43:09] &gt;&gt; Follows God. So if God's moving, there's
[2:43:12] going to be something to vindicate it.
[2:43:15] &gt;&gt; The world has always stood off
[2:43:19] and criticized it. Who is that little
[2:43:21] boy? Can you imagine that day? WHO IS
[2:43:25] THAT KID? HE'S GOING TO GET HURT DOWN
[2:43:27] THERE. WHAT IS HE DOING LEADING THAT
[2:43:29] THAT ENEMY AROUND?
[2:43:33] I DON'T CARE IF HE DOES STUMBLE AND
[2:43:35] FALL. THEY MIGHT HAVE SAID IT. I DON'T
[2:43:37] CARE IF HE DOES CRACK HIS HEAD OPEN ON
[2:43:40] THE ROCK THAT OLD SAMSON. WE USED TO
[2:43:42] TREMBLE WHEN WE HEARD HIS NAME, BUT LOOK
[2:43:44] AT HIM NOW AND AND GET THAT LITTLE BOY
[2:43:47] OUT OF THE WAY. He don't know nothing.
[2:43:49] They certainly wouldn't have understood
[2:43:51] what you and I are to understand. And
[2:43:53] that is he was playing a pivotal role.
[2:43:56] It was representing the generational
[2:43:59] shift between a Moses ministry model and
[2:44:01] a Joshua ministry model. They didn't
[2:44:03] have any idea that day that there was
[2:44:06] something being played out for them. And
[2:44:09] they didn't understand. And the remnant
[2:44:11] has never been understood. They weren't
[2:44:12] understood in any of the church ages or
[2:44:14] any of the gaps between the church ages.
[2:44:17] And there's going to be a remnant in
[2:44:18] this hour that will not be understood
[2:44:22] &gt;&gt; by her own.
[2:44:26] &gt;&gt; But she's going to hear what what the
[2:44:27] commission was and stay with the word.
[2:44:31] &gt;&gt; You're still here?
[2:44:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:44:33] The world stood off and criticized it
[2:44:35] from Adam down. They've done it every
[2:44:36] time. It's nothing new today that you
[2:44:38] should be criticized for the accepting
[2:44:40] Christ. Be ready now. Uh Benjamin and
[2:44:42] musicians. I know I threaten all the
[2:44:45] time and you think I'm I'm threatening
[2:44:47] again, but I'm I'm closing up here. I'm
[2:44:50] packing up.
[2:44:52] I'm walking to my seat.
[2:44:59] Now if you accept it in some fanaticism
[2:45:06] or persecuted for the wrong thing, you
[2:45:08] deserve it.
[2:45:10] But now look, if you have really God
[2:45:14] working with you, proving himself by
[2:45:19] Bible evidence of signs and wonders.
[2:45:22] Then you rejoice and be exceedingly glad
[2:45:27] for great is your reward in heaven.
[2:45:30] Moses, last paragraph, Moses in his
[2:45:34] journey bringing the children of Israel,
[2:45:37] God gave him a promise. Now, as God led
[2:45:41] that in the natural, so is he leading
[2:45:43] the church today in the spiritual. Now,
[2:45:47] they were going to a promised land out
[2:45:49] of a chaos.
[2:45:55] into a promised land.
[2:45:58] You just look around you
[2:46:00] from the ridiculous
[2:46:04] to the sublime. Thank you, Jesus. From
[2:46:09] chaos to clarity,
[2:46:11] from Babel's confusion to the peace.
[2:46:16] Oh, of the promise. This Joshua
[2:46:19] generation will be a humble remnant. She
[2:46:21] will not walk in bride pride, but will
[2:46:24] be dressed in the righteous garments of
[2:46:28] humility.
[2:46:30] She won't spend her time tooting her
[2:46:32] horn,
[2:46:34] making herself seem elite because there
[2:46:38] is a piece of this remnant in every
[2:46:40] nation of the world. No doubt in
[2:46:43] churches across America, there is a
[2:46:46] remnant, a remnant, a remnant who will
[2:46:49] recognize the ministry model shifting.
[2:46:52] And they will have the desire for that
[2:46:55] mo ministry model that shifts the
[2:46:58] striving effort of the stick
[2:47:01] through the peaceful authority
[2:47:04] of just speaking that word. Jesus said
[2:47:07] it.
[2:47:11] Jesus understood it. He was that
[2:47:13] creative spoken word. All he had to do,
[2:47:16] peace be still. We wave our hands. We
[2:47:20] karate chop. We intercessors do some of
[2:47:23] the craziest movements. We look like
[2:47:25] we're orchestrating some kind of
[2:47:27] invisible war sometime. But Jesus just
[2:47:30] held up his hand and said, "Peace be
[2:47:31] still." When it came time to cast the
[2:47:33] devils out many times, he he might not
[2:47:35] have even lifted his hand. He just said
[2:47:37] one word, "Go.
[2:47:41] Modern Charismatics Deliverance
[2:47:43] Ministries interview people for three
[2:47:45] hours. Fill out 300 questionnaires. 300
[2:47:48] questions on a questionnaire. Ask them
[2:47:50] things like, "Did you ever play with a
[2:47:51] Ouija board? Did you ever step on a
[2:47:53] crack and think you broke your mother's
[2:47:55] back?" And all kinds of other silly
[2:47:56] things. And Jesus just took the most
[2:47:59] possessed
[2:48:02] and said, "Go."
[2:48:04] And guess what?
[2:48:06] They had to
[2:48:21] &gt;&gt; worthy of every song we could ever sing.
[2:48:29] Worthy of all the praise we could ever
[2:48:33] bring.
[2:48:37] Worthy of every breath we could ever

[2:48:46] Oh, we live for you.
[2:48:53] Jesus, the name above every other name.
[2:49:00] Jesus, the only one who could ever save.

[2:56:46] cuz you worthy of it all.
[2:56:54] You are worthy of it all.
[2:57:02] For from you are all things
[2:57:06] and to you are all things.
[2:57:10] You deserve the glory.
[2:57:17] You are worthy of it all.
[2:57:25] Lord, you are worthy of it all.
[2:57:33] For from you are all things
[2:57:37] and to you are all things.
[2:57:41] Oh, you deserve the glory.
[2:57:51] And all the saints and angels
[2:57:58] they bow before
[2:58:02] your throne.
[2:58:07] And all the elders
[2:58:11] cast their crowns before the lamb
[2:58:16] of God
[2:58:18] and sing that you are worthy of it all.
[2:58:27] My God, you are worthy of it all.
[2:58:34] Oh, for from you are all things
[2:58:39] and to are all things.
[2:58:43] Oh, you deserve the glory.
[2:58:48] &gt;&gt; Let's tell him. Oh,
[2:58:50] &gt;&gt; he deserves
[2:58:53] it all.
[2:58:54] &gt;&gt; You brought us this far.
[2:58:56] &gt;&gt; You brought us this far.
[2:58:58] &gt;&gt; You are worthy of it all.
[2:59:01] &gt;&gt; You'll take your bride the rest of the
[2:59:03] way.
[2:59:04] It's your worthiness for from you are
[2:59:08] all things. Jesus, you are all you
[2:59:13] deserve the glory.
[2:59:14] &gt;&gt; You deserve.
[2:59:16] &gt;&gt; Sing it again.
[2:59:16] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:59:17] &gt;&gt; I want to make sure you're telling him,
[2:59:20] Lord, you're worthy. You're worthy.
[2:59:22] &gt;&gt; You are worthy of it all.
[2:59:26] &gt;&gt; You've brought us a mighty long way.
[2:59:28] You've been good.
[2:59:29] &gt;&gt; My God, you are worthy. You've been good
[2:59:31] every step of the way through the
[2:59:33] wilderness.
[2:59:36] &gt;&gt; You've proven yourself.
[2:59:38] &gt;&gt; For from you are all
[2:59:40] &gt;&gt; and we know you'll be there to take us
[2:59:42] all the way.
[2:59:42] &gt;&gt; You are all things.
[2:59:46] You deserve the glory.
[2:59:49] &gt;&gt; Now Lord, we pray right now for courage
[2:59:54] and boldness with wisdom
[2:59:57] that comes from you.
[3:00:00] It's who you are
[3:00:02] &gt;&gt; to be upon your people.
[3:00:05] We ask, THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, IF WE LACK
[3:00:09] WISDOM, WE SHOULD ASK for it. So, SO
[3:00:12] LORD, WE ASK right now for the wisdom of
[3:00:15] the of the King of Kings to be upon us.
[3:00:20] &gt;&gt; May we move in wisdom that is beyond our
[3:00:24] years of experience and beyond our
[3:00:27] learning.
[3:00:29] Lord, may we move in a wisdom that is of
[3:00:32] another world. We're often faced with
[3:00:36] circumstances and situations that we
[3:00:39] don't know how to maneuver. But if we
[3:00:41] could be if we could operate in your
[3:00:43] wisdom, Lord,
[3:00:48] &gt;&gt; you said to to Joshua
[3:00:50] through your word,
[3:00:53] be strong
[3:00:56] and of good courage.
[3:00:59] May Lord may we know your strength.
[3:01:04] The one THING WE CAN REJOICE IN IS
[3:01:07] UNDERSTANDING from scripture that your
[3:01:10] strength is made perfect.
[3:01:13] In our weakness
[3:01:16] now Lord, we've got the weakness and
[3:01:19] you've got the strength.
[3:01:21] We're yielding ourselves. Do it with me.
[3:01:23] We're yielding ourselves. Lord,
[3:01:26] &gt;&gt; we're yielding ourselves
[3:01:28] &gt;&gt; that your strength would be upon us.
[3:01:32] &gt;&gt; We want to move with strength.
[3:01:36] &gt;&gt; We want to have that overcoming
[3:01:38] anointing that moves in the strength of
[3:01:40] the Lord. And you said joy. The
[3:01:43] scripture tells us joy. The joy of the
[3:01:46] Lord is our strength. May we have joy.
[3:01:50] May we not be discouraged
[3:01:53] in times of
[3:01:56] slow movement
[3:01:58] and little progress.
[3:02:01] May we hold on to your hand and
[3:02:03] understand that the time seasons of the
[3:02:06] Lord change quickly
[3:02:09] and we can be walking in one one moment
[3:02:12] of time and see the gradually become the
[3:02:16] suddenly.
[3:02:19] We just have that strong strong
[3:02:22] inspiration
[3:02:24] that a shift is upon us again. And Lord,
[3:02:27] we want to navigate it with the wisdom
[3:02:29] of the Lord and the strength that is not
[3:02:31] ours, it's yours. Come and do that for
[3:02:34] us. Would you, Lord? May we be freshly
[3:02:37] dedicated and consecrated to the
[3:02:39] obedience of your word. May we not be so
[3:02:42] rigid and so formal and so hard, so
[3:02:45] stiff that we cling
[3:02:48] to anything that that you desire to
[3:02:52] break forth with something new. You see,
[3:02:56] we recognize that your ministry model
[3:03:01] was to move under the inspiration of the
[3:03:03] spirit of the Lord and bring freedom to
[3:03:06] the oppressed and healing to the sick
[3:03:09] and deliverance to the captives. And
[3:03:12] Lord, it's not that any of us would want
[3:03:14] to build a reputation in ministry. It
[3:03:17] It's your name that we want to glorify.
[3:03:21] We want to see this little bride come
[3:03:23] into the fullness of her inheritance.
[3:03:26] You said it was ours.
[3:03:29] &gt;&gt; Most of us would quickly disqualify
[3:03:32] ourselves. And you are ever standing
[3:03:34] with your word and spirit to re-qualify
[3:03:37] us
[3:03:39] &gt;&gt; to tell us you called us
[3:03:41] &gt;&gt; and all we have to do is yield. May
[3:03:44] there be a new sense of yielding.
[3:03:48] As brother Gley prayed today, if there's
[3:03:50] any part of who we are that we have
[3:03:52] reserved or held back from you, may we
[3:03:55] may we open the door now and allow you
[3:03:58] to move in every part.
[3:04:01] May you be able to fully occupy your
[3:04:04] little bride for the days of visitation
[3:04:07] are over
[3:04:09] and these are the days of occupation.
[3:04:13] And I heard you say this morning at my
[3:04:15] dining room table as I was studying that
[3:04:18] that that little lad was insignificant
[3:04:20] in his day. But even as you have spoken
[3:04:24] to us before, I will bring you from
[3:04:27] obscurity
[3:04:29] to visibility,
[3:04:31] from visitation to habitation. And we've
[3:04:35] been holding on to those words. And I
[3:04:37] believe Lord that now is the time to
[3:04:39] grab a hold of that with the deepest
[3:04:41] faith that we have.
[3:04:44] We are no longer satisfied with just a
[3:04:46] feeling or a momentary visitation. Lord,
[3:04:50] come and occupy your people. We know
[3:04:53] that's your desire because you said it.
[3:04:56] You wanted to build a house. You wanted
[3:04:58] to build a home in us. Why don't you
[3:05:00] just tell him before we leave, Lord,
[3:05:02] come and build your home.
[3:05:04] Let me be your dwelling place.
[3:05:08] &gt;&gt; This is not a one-man thing. It's a it's
[3:05:10] a generational call,
[3:05:14] &gt;&gt; Lord. May I be one of those,
[3:05:16] &gt;&gt; fully occupied harbori.
[3:05:20] May I be fully occupied
[3:05:23] by the heavy presence of God that brings
[3:05:27] with it all his wisdom and all of his
[3:05:30] strength and all of his courage and and
[3:05:33] his mind.
[3:05:36] That we would no longer keep reverting
[3:05:38] back to our own thoughts and opinions,
[3:05:41] but that we would begin with
[3:05:43] supernatural strength to know your
[3:05:46] thoughts and to know your heart. May we
[3:05:48] may we find the value
[3:05:51] in laying our head on your chest
[3:05:55] &gt;&gt; in relationship in closeness in intimacy
[3:05:59] &gt;&gt; that we might know the very heartbeat
[3:06:04] that we might move and be regulated
[3:06:09] by your heartbeat.
[3:06:12] We don't want to be doing something that
[3:06:14] you've moved on from.
[3:06:17] There's a time and a season for all
[3:06:19] administrations. The scripture says
[3:06:23] there was a time that you use printed
[3:06:25] tracks.
[3:06:28] If you're still using them today, I want
[3:06:30] to have them. I want to be giving them
[3:06:31] out.
[3:06:33] But it seems to me that under this age,
[3:06:35] you said that we are living epistles,
[3:06:38] living letters
[3:06:40] &gt;&gt; read by all men. It seems to ME THAT IT
[3:06:42] WAS your desire in this last day to live
[3:06:45] in A BRIDE, TO OCCUPY A BRIDE UNTIL WE
[3:06:47] BECAME the track, until we become the
[3:06:50] demonstration
[3:06:52] of what a laid down, surrendered life
[3:06:54] looks like.
[3:06:57] Will you surrender your will today
[3:06:59] before you go? Will you surrender your
[3:07:01] will? Would you just say, "Lord, come
[3:07:03] and have your complete way in me.
[3:07:08] If you want to rebuild me and shift me
[3:07:09] and change me, I I I'm willing. I I've
[3:07:13] worked on changing myself and I don't
[3:07:15] get so far. But Lord, I I open up my
[3:07:18] life.
[3:07:20] Come in,
[3:07:22] execute change.
[3:07:27] Reveal to me a pattern that you would
[3:07:29] have me walk out.
[3:07:33] Lord, haven't many of us proven
[3:07:36] that if you'll make it clear, we'll walk
[3:07:38] it.
[3:07:41] We don't have to see the next 10 years.
[3:07:44] If you'll just show us the next step, by
[3:07:47] your grace, we'll take it.
[3:07:52] And every time we take the next ordered
[3:07:54] step of the Lord,
[3:07:56] we loose the favor and blessing
[3:08:00] to finish the call.
[3:08:03] If you've called us,
[3:08:06] you have to equip us.
[3:08:11] We surrender.
[3:08:16] For from you are all things
[3:08:20] and to you are all things.
[3:08:25] You deserve the glory.
[3:08:28] Somebody lift your heart and hands and
[3:08:30] tell him again, "Oh, you are worthy of
[3:08:34] it all.
[3:08:39] You are worthy. You're worthy of it all.
[3:08:43] &gt;&gt; I've seen what you can do.
[3:08:46] I've seen what you can do. For from you
[3:08:50] are all things
[3:08:52] and to you are all things."
[3:08:55] &gt;&gt; Lord, help us to build an atmosphere.
[3:08:57] You deserve it.
[3:08:58] &gt;&gt; Where the supernatural can demonstrate
[3:09:01] &gt;&gt; in our everyday life, not just when we
[3:09:03] get together.
[3:09:04] &gt;&gt; Worthy of it all.
[3:09:08] &gt;&gt; The lamb is worthy.
[3:09:11] You are worthy of it all.
[3:09:19] For from you are all things.
[3:09:21] &gt;&gt; From you are all things. and to
[3:09:24] &gt;&gt; and unto you are all things
[3:09:27] &gt;&gt; you deserve.
[3:09:27] &gt;&gt; You deserve
[3:09:30] &gt;&gt; Come and sing it again.
[3:09:32] &gt;&gt; Let's get lost in it for just a moment.
[3:09:37] &gt;&gt; Day and night, night and day, night and
[3:09:39] day, let in.
[3:09:43] Lord, let us be on our watch. Day and
[3:09:45] night, night and day, let in. May we not
[3:09:49] come down.
[3:09:52] Day and night, night and day, let in.
[3:09:56] &gt;&gt; A sword in one hand
[3:09:59] and a tool in the other. Night and day
[3:10:03] in.
[3:10:04] &gt;&gt; May we not let the detractors cause us
[3:10:06] to come down from
[3:10:09] night and day in.
[3:10:12] &gt;&gt; Let the watchman rise in this hour. Day
[3:10:15] and night. Night and day.
[3:10:18] &gt;&gt; What of the night? Oh,
[3:10:21] God of the night.
[3:10:22] &gt;&gt; Day and night, night and day, let in.
[3:10:28] Yes. Yes. Day and night, night and day,
[3:10:34] you are worthy of it all.
[3:10:39] Let your bride take her place.
[3:10:42] You are worthy of it all in the
[3:10:45] dimension of intercession.
[3:10:50] For from you that only flows out of
[3:10:53] truth and spirit
[3:10:55] are all things.
[3:10:56] &gt;&gt; You deserve the glory.
[3:10:58] &gt;&gt; You deserve the glory.
[3:11:00] &gt;&gt; Again,
[3:11:02] &gt;&gt; I know it's late.
[3:11:05] &gt;&gt; You're worthy. You're worthy of it all.
[3:11:09] &gt;&gt; How many of you have seen what he can do
[3:11:11] AND YOU JUST WANT TO SAY, "Just once
[3:11:13] more, Lord.
[3:11:14] &gt;&gt; Of it all.
[3:11:15] &gt;&gt; Just once more, Lord.
[3:11:18] Show yourself mighty overcome. You are
[3:11:22] all
[3:11:22] &gt;&gt; Let us see the miraculous.
[3:11:25] &gt;&gt; Let us see the supernatural again.
[3:11:27] &gt;&gt; My God, you deserve the glory.
[3:11:30] &gt;&gt; Use us to bring in a final harvest.
[3:11:33] &gt;&gt; You deserve the glory.
[3:11:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, you are.
[3:11:36] &gt;&gt; May the lamb receive the reward.
[3:11:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, you are, Lord. You are worthy. May
[3:11:44] we dress ourselves
[3:11:46] in the cloak of humility.
[3:11:49] May we hold to the lamb's head all
[3:11:52] things
[3:11:54] to
[3:11:56] &gt;&gt; in honor and hope and holiness
[3:11:59] &gt;&gt; and in humility glory.
[3:12:05] You worthy of it all.
[3:12:11] Oh,
[3:12:11] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you feel that that he's
[3:12:13] here.
[3:12:15] &gt;&gt; All
[3:12:20] for you are all.
[3:12:23] &gt;&gt; Let it flow out of him.
[3:12:25] &gt;&gt; And let it flow out of you,
[3:12:27] &gt;&gt; unto him.
[3:12:29] &gt;&gt; You deserve the glory.
[3:12:34] When I was sitting there this morning
[3:12:36] preparing my my last thoughts that I
[3:12:39] didn't get to,
[3:12:41] I was reminded of a of a visionary
[3:12:43] experience that I had in 2010.
[3:12:49] And I saw in a distance four angelic
[3:12:53] beings coming my way. I'm not
[3:12:54] embarrassed to tell you
[3:12:57] it wasn't a dream. It was a visionary
[3:12:59] type thing. And
[3:13:02] I was curious as to what they've come
[3:13:03] for.
[3:13:06] And I asked, "Why are you here?" Their
[3:13:08] answer was, "We've come to help you hold
[3:13:11] to his head."
[3:13:15] It's in Colossians.
[3:13:18] It's vitally important.
[3:13:21] I'll minister it Tuesday night, Lord
[3:13:22] willing.
[3:13:24] It's vitally important that we hold to
[3:13:26] his head.
[3:13:29] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Well, how will I do that?"
[3:13:31] And one by one, they answered one word.
[3:13:36] One said, "In hope."
[3:13:43] One said in honor.
[3:13:47] The next one said in holiness.
[3:13:52] And the fourth one said in humility.
[3:13:56] And then one by one they began to talk
[3:13:58] to me just a little bit just just a
[3:14:01] little bit about what those words mean.
[3:14:05] And it's in the scripture.
[3:14:08] We can't lose hope.
[3:14:11] I know that the value of faith perhaps
[3:14:14] is higher than hope.
[3:14:16] But hope is believing with great
[3:14:20] anticipation and expectation
[3:14:24] and and and waiting on the promises can
[3:14:27] certainly cause you to have this this
[3:14:30] hope deferred
[3:14:32] can can bring the Bible said it can
[3:14:34] bring sickness to your bones.
[3:14:39] And so we can't let our hope become
[3:14:41] deferred in such a way that we say we're
[3:14:43] tired of waiting. We're tired of
[3:14:44] waiting, Lord. We're tired of waiting.
[3:14:46] We have to keep holding his head and
[3:14:47] hope. It's coming. My faith answers the
[3:14:51] challenge. It's coming. God's got
[3:14:53] something for us greater than what we've
[3:14:55] experienced.
[3:14:58] And then in honor, we've got to learn to
[3:14:59] honor the lamb above all. And we're
[3:15:02] going to have to learn to honor one
[3:15:03] another. And that's going to be part of
[3:15:05] that fusion I was trying to talk about,
[3:15:07] I will later, of the generations coming
[3:15:10] together. We've got to honor the
[3:15:11] generation before us.
[3:15:14] We can fe we can see their mistakes. We
[3:15:16] can feel and and recognize where they
[3:15:19] may have missed. But we cannot let that
[3:15:23] cause us to bring dishonor
[3:15:27] because but by the grace of God, we'll
[3:15:30] fall in the same holes. Amen.
[3:15:33] &gt;&gt; And we've got to learn not only to honor
[3:15:35] the generation before us, we've going to
[3:15:36] have to learn to honor one another in a
[3:15:39] way that's a lot different than what we
[3:15:40] see happening in this hour.
[3:15:43] And we're going to have to walk in
[3:15:44] holiness,
[3:15:46] which is not the way you dress and the
[3:15:48] way you do your hair. We like to
[3:15:49] sometimes refer to holiness as that. But
[3:15:52] it it means the choice of the Lord.
[3:15:53] You're the choice of the Lord. He's
[3:15:55] chose you for this hour.
[3:15:57] &gt;&gt; And if he places his holiness on you,
[3:16:01] if he places it on me, I'm holy.
[3:16:04] &gt;&gt; I've just got to make sure to walk under
[3:16:05] that, not walk out from under it.
[3:16:07] &gt;&gt; And then humility
[3:16:09] without him. Let's Let's be real.
[3:16:12] hillbilly. Without him, we ain't
[3:16:14] nothing.
[3:16:15] &gt;&gt; We ain't nothing. Never will be without
[3:16:17] him. But with him, we can be all that he
[3:16:20] says we are. So, would you ask the Lord
[3:16:22] this week as you go? Would you ask the
[3:16:24] Lord to help you re be reminded and
[3:16:28] remember and and and never forget to
[3:16:31] keep holding on to him. Hold the head of
[3:16:33] the lamb.
[3:16:38] That's what abiding in the vine is all
[3:16:40] about.
[3:16:42] You're drawing strength from him. How
[3:16:44] many of you found that he's the greatest
[3:16:46] source of strength.
[3:16:51] &gt;&gt; I know you got to go, but there's
[3:16:53] something here.
[3:16:57] Lord, as we leave,
[3:17:03] we don't want to leave you here.
[3:17:06] We want to take everything that you are,
[3:17:09] everything that you've ministered to us
[3:17:11] by your presence today. We want to take
[3:17:13] it with us,
[3:17:15] Lord. May we not let anything disturb
[3:17:17] this peace.
[3:17:20] Oh, the enemy will bring something up
[3:17:22] before the day is over to have us back
[3:17:24] on the bandwagon of chaos and criticism.
[3:17:29] But Lord, I ask right now that we would
[3:17:31] be so mindful and so discerning that we
[3:17:35] would keep choosing peace.
[3:17:39] Oh my.
[3:17:45] Go with us Lord Jesus today.
[3:17:48] Thank you for these beautiful, wonderful
[3:17:50] visitors.
[3:17:53] May they take something with them also
[3:17:56] tangible.
[3:18:02] Lord, may we all make a choice today
[3:18:03] whether or not we're willing
[3:18:06] to be identified with the rejected
[3:18:08] remnant, misunderstood
[3:18:11] remnant,
[3:18:13] to keep moving with the lamb.
[3:18:20] When you go, we want to go. When you
[3:18:21] stop, we want to stop.
[3:18:24] When you change direction, we want to
[3:18:26] change direction with you. We're
[3:18:28] following the pillar of fire, not the
[3:18:30] picture.
[3:18:32] We're following the pillar of fire. Go
[3:18:34] with us today. Lord, continue to perfect
[3:18:37] your healing in every every person's
[3:18:39] body represented here and on the stream.
[3:18:42] We're tired of this sickness among us.
[3:18:46] We want to walk in health.
[3:19:00] Day and night, night and day, let
[3:19:04] incense arise.
[3:19:08] Day and night, night and day, let
[3:19:12] incense arise.
[3:19:16] Day and night, night and day, let in
[3:19:20] arise.
[3:19:23] Day and night, night and day, let in
[3:19:28] arise.
[3:19:31] Day and night, night and day. Let us be
[3:19:35] like,
[3:19:38] we soak up your presence. Night and day,
[3:19:42] let in arise.
[3:19:46] Day and night. Night and day. Let in
[3:19:50] sins arise.
[3:19:54] Yes. Day and night. Night and day. Let
[3:19:58] in sins arise.
[3:20:01] Day and night. Night and day. Let in
[3:20:06] sins arise.
[3:20:09] Day and night. Night and day.
[3:20:14] You are worthy of it all.
[3:20:18] &gt;&gt; Sing it through one time, then you're
[3:20:20] dismissed to go in the name of the Lord.
[3:20:23] &gt;&gt; Worthy of it.
[3:20:24] &gt;&gt; You don't have to wait until we're
[3:20:25] through singing. Thank you for being
[3:20:28] here. God bless you.
[3:20:29] &gt;&gt; For from you are all things.
[3:20:32] &gt;&gt; Greet brother Trent Brent on his
[3:20:35] birthday.
[3:20:38] &gt;&gt; You deserve the glory.
[3:20:40] &gt;&gt; Sister West has a birthday this week.
[3:20:43] Pray for her tomorrow in Landon May next
[3:20:46] Saturday. Pray for these that aren't
[3:20:48] able to be here today. May God just
[3:20:51] bless you as you go. You are worthy of
[3:20:54] it all.
[3:21:00] For from you are all things
[3:21:04] and to are all things.
[3:21:07] &gt;&gt; You deserve the glory.
[3:21:08] &gt;&gt; You deserve the glory. Can you make sure
[3:21:12] that Can you make sure that we have a
[3:21:14] correct email address for you because
[3:21:18] the contribution statements will go out
[3:21:21] this week by email. We'll have the
[3:21:24] children's printed so they can receive
[3:21:26] them in a service because they enjoy
[3:21:28] that. And if you request for them to be
[3:21:32] uh printed, we can do that. We just
[3:21:34] don't have a lot of extra time, but we
[3:21:37] will email them. Uh, so make sure if
[3:21:38] you've changed your email, you probably
[3:21:40] don't want it bouncing around out there,
[3:21:43] maybe going to the wrong person. So if
[3:21:44] you've given to the church this year,
[3:21:46] make sure if it's changed, you turn in a
[3:21:49] new one. Amen. Go. Go now. God bless you
[3:21:52] as you leave. You're worthy of it all.
[3:22:00] For from you are all things
[3:22:05] and to are all things.

[3:22:22] you, sweetheart.
[3:22:23] &gt;&gt; You worthy of it all.
