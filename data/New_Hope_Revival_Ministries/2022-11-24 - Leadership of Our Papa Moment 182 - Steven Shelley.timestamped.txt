[0:13] Jesus said I can do nothing
[0:18] God in flesh
[0:20] the word in a body
[0:23] said I can do nothing except it be
[0:26] revealed of me of my father Jesus said I
[0:30] can't do anything unless my father does
[0:33] it
[0:35] you know how powerful that is
[0:37] do you know how many messes are made
[0:40] because people go
[0:43] When papa didn't say go
[0:47] do you know how many messes are made
[0:49] when people say yes
[0:51] and papa didn't say yes
[0:53] when people take jobs that God didn't
[0:56] originate for them
[0:58] when men take companions
[1:02] that were not birthed in the heart of
[1:04] God for them do you know what a mess I
[1:07] can make
[1:08] you cannot sustain In the Flesh what was
[1:12] born in the spirit the only way to
[1:15] sustain what's born in the spirit is to
[1:18] do it by the spirit and by the
[1:21] leadership of our Papa
[1:23] and everything we do must be because
[1:26] we're LED
[1:27] by the spirit of God to do it
[1:30] it's the only way for us to be
[1:32] successful in this hour is to wait on
[1:34] Papa to do it as he says in the way he
[1:38] says do it in Papa's timing

[1:46] price in my life I have paid a price for
[1:48] doing it my way it's supposed to come
[1:50] out from him meaning according to his
[1:52] perfect will and it's to be accomplished
[1:55] through him meaning by spirit Power by
[1:57] the power of the Holy Spirit and I want
[1:59] you to know when we are moving in the
[2:01] Holy Spirit power in holy ghost power
[2:03] and we're moving in the authority of the
[2:06] bridegroom
[2:07] in the timing of the Lord by the perfect
[2:11] will of God there's not a devil in hell
[2:15] that can stop you from doing what God
[2:18] has ordained you to do have you ever
[2:21] asked yourself why am I doing what I'm
[2:23] doing am I doing it for his name to be
[2:26] glorified am I doing it so somebody will
[2:28] thank me if you're doing it unto the
[2:32] Lord you're doing it because you love
[2:34] him it's Ministry it's ministering unto
[2:38] the Lord and it's the reason why we were
[2:41] born and God will bless you there is a
[2:45] record count
[2:47] for every sincere Hallelujah for every
[2:51] passionate amen there is a record count
