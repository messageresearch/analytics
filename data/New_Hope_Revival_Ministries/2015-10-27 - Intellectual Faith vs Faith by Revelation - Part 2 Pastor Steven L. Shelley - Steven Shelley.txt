TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] this is the day that the Lord has made let us rejoice and be glad in it hello I'm Pastor Steven Shelly and you're watching the Eagles cry and I want to welcome you to the program today we've been having a wonderful time as we have studied God's word these past few weeks and months and I'm just so thankful for the privilege that God has given me to be able to come to you wherever you are in the world well I'm in little tiny Smith Station Alabama USA perhaps that's a long way from where you are right now and so that's why I count it such a privilege that the Lord has given us to be able to bring these programs of study of teaching and sometimes a little preaching too to be a blessing to you to Str strengthen you in your faith I know that things are looking dark out there but in inside of the children of God is a glorious light the light of the Lord Jesus Christ he said I am the light of the world and you and I are here in this Earth for such a time as this that we might be able to reflect that great light that lives within us you know we study the Old Testament scriptures and we find a God who was above us who lived above the people people in a cloud in a pillar of fire that's how he manifested himself and then we look to the newer Covenant we start reading the gospels and we see a God who was with us Emmanuel in the Lord Jesus Christ walking and talking teaching Healing The Sick raising the dead and then on the day of Pentecost in Acts chapter 2 we see another great installment another great demonstration of God in the earth and that was through the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire it was prophesied by John the Baptist he will come and baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire and we read that it happened in Acts chapter 2 that great day when Peter stood up and preached that amazing sermon uh this is not what you think it is these are not drunk as you suppose but this is that which was prophesied by the prophet Joel that in the last days I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and you know that's exactly what happened that day it was the beginning of the New Testament Holy Ghost filled Church body of the Lord Jesus Christ and so what was that was that just a another uh part of God another person of the godhead what was that that was none other than The Same Spirit that lived inside of our Lord Jesus Christ in fact the Bible tells us if that same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead if it also dwell in you it shall also Quicken your mortal body and Jesus told his disciples I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you and that's exactly what he did it's also The Same Spirit that overshadowed his Earthly mother Mary so that she conceived this little baby Our Savior he's not a baby anymore he's not in the manger anymore in fact he's not on the cross anymore his Spirit lives inside of us and he is ever at the father's right hand even right now at the Throne of God making intercession for you and I I'm so thankful today folks that we have a high priest who can be touched with the feelings of our infirmities he knows what you're going through he feels your pain even in that moment when you feel weak and you feel tempted to uh to give up you feel tempted to follow uh sin you know follow the lust uh follow the desire that gets stirred up in you for the things of this world and even in those moments our Lord understands that moment of weakness he understands the pull against your flesh the Bible said he was in all manner tempted as we are yet without sin don't ever forget that Jesus said because I have overcome you shall also overcome so the same spirit of God that was in our Lord Jesus Christ that caused him to be able to overcome not only the world the elements the spirit of the age but also death and hell and the grave that same Spirit lives inside of us to give us the grace to overcome whatever is thrown our way so I want you to know that we once saw a God above us and then the perhaps one of the greatest demonstrations was God With Us in the body of the Lord Jesus Christ but I tell you what Thrills me Beyond expression is that he is now God in us you get a good revelation of that and you'll kick the devil out when he comes to try to discourage you you'll just raise up now I don't mean it'll always be the first thought that comes to your mind no you've got to pull it you've got to dig down inside of you and find that truth and pull it up and then rebuke the devil the Bible said that if we submit ourselves unto God and then resist the devil he has no choice he has to flee from us uh I like reading about our Lord in the wilderness fasting and praying and here Satan shows up to tempt him the Bible actually tells us he was moved by the spirit driven by the spirit Into the Wilderness because this was a test that he had to face and I want you to know that when the enemy came one way and then changed his mask and came another way changed his mask and came another way the answer was always the same it is written and Jesus began to quote the word of God and I want you to know that we have the word of God it is ours it has been given to us it is a part of the love gifts that Messiah has given given to his Earthly bride in this hour is the word of God and that word is quick and it is sharp and it is powerful and it has the ability unlike any other force in the universe to discern between Soul and Spirit and so if you're wondering what realm you're operating in am I operating in the flesh am I operating in the soul am I operating in the spirit the answer is found in the revelation of the word of God now the the Bible that we have is the written record of God's word but I want you to know that when the Holy Spirit comes and anoints that word when when the pages of this book become alive before your eyes and I trust and pray that you've had that experience where you're just reading along and it it it feels like you're reading a maybe a Dusty story I'll just be honest something that was written so many hundreds and thousands of years ago that you can hardly relate to it and then all of a sudden the anointing of the holy spirit that anointing that breaks and destroys every yoke of bondage that anointing falls on you and the word the printed page word of God becomes the Living Word of God and it becomes a revelation in your life and then you have the ability once God reveals something to you once the word is Quicken to you and becomes alive in you it becomes a part of who you are that Revelation becomes a part of your spiritual DNA and you have every right to use that Revelation as a powerful weapon against your enemy it is absolutely yours given to you by the Holy Spirit through Revelation and that's what we started studying when we were together the last time we're talking about faith I want you to know the Bible defines faith for us in the book of Hebrews faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of Things Not Seen if you can already see it it's not faith it doesn't require Faith to access what you can already see but when you are able to hope against hope when you are able to believe God in spite of the unbelievable circumstances in spite of the hopelessness of the situation but there's something on the inside of you that grabs a hold of the promise of God and you say I will not let my promise go you know that's what we really need we need more of the of the written word to become a Living Word in us a personal Revelation now a foundation for a personal revelation can be laid by good teaching and preaching pure uh not doctrinated not adulterated mixed up compromised Twisted to say something but the pure word of God given to us by Revelation made personal that's what Revelation does it makes the promise it makes the word of God become personal and it gives us the authority to use that promise absolutely against the enemy and so you know uh remember in the Bible that that some of the followers of Jesus were going to cast out demons from from the man and uh especially the sons of ska they were going to cast out the demons out of this man and they began to adure him in the name of Paul you know in the name of and and the demons cried out and they said Jesus I know and Paul I know but who are you what Authority do you have this is what they were saying where is your Authority where is the life behind the name here you're using these names but you have no personal connection to the name of Jesus you have no personal connection to the name of Paul or Peter or any of the other apostles how do you think you can use it like a magic remedy like some uh Magic expression some word magical words the demons knew better than that didn't they they came out they came out because they wanted to come out but the Bible tells us they they stripped the clothes off of these men and these preacher boys went running through the streets without their clothes on and that's exactly what will happen to you if you try to take the word of God and use it without a connection to it without a revelation of it without a relationship with it uh it's not a magical formula it has to become a part of who you are and we as children of God elected by God before the foundation of the world we come here with a representation of God in us and yet we need God to come and fill up that place um it's like a seed and that seed has to be watered it has to be uh in the presence of the sun this time the s o n instead of the Su n and it has to be fertilized by faith and we have to hear a word that awakens us it's like uh Sleeping Beauty awakened by a kiss in the kids's fairy tale you need the kiss of the Holy Spirit to awaken you out of your deathly sleep so that you can embrace the word of God and all that it represents and brother sister when you begin to receive Revelation on the word of God you become a viable threat to the enemy I'm telling you if you'll just you know believe what the preacher oh yes that's good amen preacher I like what you said that was very good and then go out and forget all about it you're no threat to the enemy he's going to walk all over you but if you begin to ask ask that the Holy Ghost the holy spirit of God when you're sitting in the service or you're listening to to this fine Christian television network and you're hearing the word of God go forth begin to ask that the holy spirit of God would give you Revelation you know someone said is that okay for me to ask is it all right for me to isn't that presumptuous for me to ask that God make his word real to me oh no friend that's exactly what God wants to do he wants to take this written word and transform it into a Living Word in you most of the time the first God that people meet is the written record of God and yet and that's good because that helps to uh certainly correct some of the error of our tradition and our false Faith false religions so thank God for the written word the absolute record of God's word but I want you to know Satan can still come and and and and confuse you and move you off of what you hear but once that becomes a revelation of faith I mean it gets way down on the inside of the inside now you know when we first come to the Lord we believe what we're taught people teach us they they show it to us seems like in the scripture and we say well that's what it says that must be what it means and we we go along with that then the enemy comes and we start trying to use those principles that we've learned we find out they're not working like they're supposed to work because we have believed a misunderstanding a misrepresentation of God's word that's why we need Holy Spirit Revelation that's why we need God to anoint our eyes with Isa because when we get the true understanding of God's word the full beautiful complete revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ when that becomes a part of who we are it changes everything now does that mean we no longer have problems well I wish I could tell you that and be honest but that's not the case in fact you may see an increase of trouble well thanks for telling me now I know I don't want any part of that well if it's for you if this Revelation is for you if God is unveiling himself to you you can't run from it you absolutely can't he's going to find you he's going to seek you out he's going to begin to orchestrate situations in your life where you keep coming in contact with a revelation that God wants you to learn about to to submit to to understand and so okay yes maybe sometime when we start moving up in Revelation toward the the Perfection uh the stature of the perfect man the Lord Jesus Christ sure the the enemy rages sure the devil gets upset and he Huffs and he Puffs and he tries to blow our house down but he can't because our house is no longer built on the traditions of men it's no longer built on the dogmas and Creeds of false and Harlot religion it is now built on the Rock the solid rock not just on Peter Petro that little Stone uh many people are looking to Peter as the first pope and as the F uh as the true foundation of the church well I want you to know that the church is not built on any one man it is built on the revelation of Yeshua the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ whose Foundation is the prophets and the apostles that's what the scripture tells us it's not built on Peter or or Phillip or Thomas or any of the other great men great evangelists great Apostles of the scripture only on the Lord Jesus Christ now when God begins to make that word real to you again it becomes a part of who you are it gives you the equipment the unction that you need to stand against the enemy so when Faith becomes anointed faith is just a part of the written word there's other things that we need to understand we need to understand love we need to understand hope we need to understand courage and and uh patience we need to understand longsuffering and meekness and joy and peace and so forth but faith is such an important concept to get ah hold of Faith becomes nearly tangible when it is Anointed when it comes from a revelation it changes everything um you know you can have intellectual faith and that is okay it actually is okay because it's a starting point but it's not enough to slay the Giants it's not enough to cast out demons it's not enough to defeat the enemy in your life you're going to have to have the Holy Spirit to breathe on your faith to Quicken it to make it alive to get it out of grave clothes you know uh Jesus said concerning Lazarus who he had just just raised from the dead loose him and let him go and you know that's my prayer for you that God would loose your faith that he would pour anointing on that faith and Revelation on that Faith so that you would start to believe When Faith becomes a revelation we haven't even looked at our scriptures or our notes today but I feel pretty good anyway when Faith becomes a revelation when it really becomes uh a part of you it changes your vocabulary that's where I need help sometime because what I know and what I say don't always line up and yet the scripture said out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh and so we have to ask that God brings such revelation of faith in us that even our thought processes because before something can come out of our mouth a word can come out of our mouth it starts in a thought process so I've been asking the spirit of God to to cover my thought processes so that when I start thinking about a situation and and expressing it whatever that situation is when it becomes expression through words I want my vocabulary to Ring to to uh uh be like the the tolling of a bell I want it to sound out like a trumpet my faith I want my faith to be demonst strated by my vocabulary and by the way I live my life and one of the ways that you can see when faith is not a pure Revelation in someone's life is fear is present I want you to know fear is the enemy your enemy wants you to fear to fear man to fear cancer to fear death to fear change uh uh to fear sickness it goes on and on and on and on fear calam ity uh fear death and and if he can uh anoint Us in fear if the enemy can sow and spread fear in our lives it paralyzes our faith when faith is only a mental concept but when Faith becomes more than intellectual Faith or mental concept faith when it becomes Faith by Revelation it cannot it will not it refuses to be paralyzed by fear in fact faith will rise up and and and oh I almost said something kind of strange I I won't say that because perhaps you'd misunderstand my the expression in the South you know we have all these strange Expressions so I won't say that I'll just say that Faith Rises up to to look fear in the eye and say get out of here you are not a part of this Blood Bought Holy Ghost filled Spirit washed child of God and so that's one of the reasons why it's so important and we started looking last time at the life of Peter and we watched his faith be transformed from only intellectual Faith to Faith by Revelation he got a true Revelation that that Jesus was the Messiah the Messiah the Son of the Living God and that re ation never wavered it never wavered now there were some things about Peter's Faith That Shook and that was his relationship with him remember we talked about last week that he denied his relationship uh they said to him you know you're one of them and he said oh no no that was in Luke chapter 22 oh no uh I don't know what you're talking about you know uh uh Thou Art also of them and Peter said man I'm not and he denied but notice he didn't deny who Jesus was no sir because that had become a very clear Revelation to him in Matthew chapter 16 and so he didn't deny who Jesus was he only denied that he had a relationship with him and that is tragic because that's what the enemy would like to do to you squeeze you into a place of denial where you would deny perhaps you would never deny that Jesus is the savior the son of the Living God but if he can get you to deny that you have a personal relationship with him not because you joined the church not because you shook a preacher's hand or your name was inscribed on the RO book of the church but because you're born again of the spirit of God it's not about joining a church shaking a hand filling out a card going through a process that's not enough that's only intellectual ual connection but Revelation connection what connects Us by the spirit to the body of the Lord Jesus Christ is a born again experience being saved by the by grace through the blood being Sanctified by the washing of the water of the word and being filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire these are the stages that bring us into the new birth into the true Born Again experience and when that becomes real to you it's hard for someone to talk you out of it if you just go because a lot of folks are going to church you go with them okay I believe what they're saying is true okay that's good but it's just the beginning you've got to have that transformation of Mind Faith intellectual Faith mental Faith to a true Spirit anointed breathed on faith so don't let the enemy come and try to make you deny your relationship with him he loves you you know even if you're not walking in the way that you should walk even if you're not fully doing what you know to do the Bible does say to him that knows to do good and does it not to him it is sin there's no doubt about it and so I'm not trying to cover up your sin or compromise with you in the area of sin but what I am telling you is your sin does not change his love for you and it doesn't change his purposes for you he still wants to bring you to that intimate walk to that true relationship with him but what happens so many times is people get discouraged by their own failure and they give up listen to me if you could save yourself if you could fix all that's wrong in your life by yourself why would Jesus have had to come why would he why would he have had to suffer and die and raise again the whole process would have been uh repetitious unnecessary it it would have been absolutely there would been no need for that but because we cannot do it ourselves because we needed a great high priest because we needed a token who would give us both grace and mercy he came thanks be to God he came and so don't be discouraged by your failure get up and keep pressing toward the lord Jesus Christ you'll get it you'll get this thing he'll strengthen you and underg guard you and help you father I ask you for that right now in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ those who are struggling in their faith those who have failed and the enemy is using that failure to sabotage their faith I rebuke that Devourer I rebuke the enemy and resist him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I tell that enemy take your hands off the children of the most high God and Lord bring breathe strength and life into them now I pray in the mighty name of Yeshua our Messiah the Lord Jesus Christ thank you so much for watching the Eagles cry today tune in again next time I have plenty more to share bye-bye for now [Music] h [Music]
