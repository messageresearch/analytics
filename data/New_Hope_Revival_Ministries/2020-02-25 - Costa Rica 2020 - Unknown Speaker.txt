Description:
Brother Greeley was given a prophetic word 20 years ago that he would have a special anointing for the people of Central & South America. 
1996 was the first time Brother & Sister Greeley made a trip to Costa Rica with Believer’s Youth Camp International. Although he has been to Central & South America a few times before, he never felt like it was “the time.”
Coming home with many testimonies, an invitation to return to Costa Rica in the spring, & an open door to Honduras, they feel as though this is the time they will really begin walking in that promised anointing.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] we've got to help to pray these young people through to the Holy Ghost and that is really the the whole attitude of these youth camps is for young people to get an experience with the Lord that they'll never forget and that will keep them wolf from wandering away from from the Lord from the church but that will keep them strong through the years so the first time we went to Costa Rica was in 1996 with brother Mike Siebert he is the one that invited us to go on our very first missionary journey right and so that was the first time we were ever out of the country I had been to Canada before but never to leave the North American continent well he invited us to go along with brother Lindsey McGrady and his wife sister Sharon and several others and so when I found out that brother Lindsey McGrady was going again this year and I had not been for 24 years I thought this would be opportune time and this came about after the pastor we met him in the youth camp in Indiana this year this past year 2019 and he invited us to come and so we prayed about it and it felt like that it was the right time for us to go and then Joyce said that she wanted to go and it's a beautiful country why not and so I began to talk to brother Lindsey and I said his sister Sharon going with you this time and he said well she wants to and so the Lord worked it out that our wives could go with us and of course a minister is better when he has his wife with him and so it was a great honor to take my wife with me and go back to Costa Rica after 24 years I think for a minister in many ways his wife is home and after he goes and he pours himself out preaching and you know afterwards the enemy is always going to attack with questions and with doubts and and you know did you do your best or did you save this that you shouldn't have said whatever but having somebody that you're so confident in their loving and somebody that's very familiar to you with you is a very big help and I believe that if there had been no other reason for me and sister Sharon to go that that would have been sufficient but I believe that the Lord used us in so much more than that believers youth camp which stemmed from the believers youth camp here in the States brother Mike Siebert is the one who was instrumental in starting believers youth camp in 1982 I believe he and brother John la Fontaine started the first youth camp in West Milton Ohio and now all these years later that campground we could no longer use it so it got moved to Indiana and then the leadership was turned to brother Mike's son Douglas but somewhere in the course of those years brother Mike felt the burden to go to foreign countries and start a youth camp in other countries and I think that the one in Costa Rica in 1996 was the first one and out of it was born believers youth camp International brother mike has gone to many of the Central and South American countries to hold these youth camps and what he tries to do is go and establish with a local pastor in one of these countries and he helps to support it he desires for the kids to be hungry enough for the Lord that they want to be able to pay a fee to help to pay for the camp or a local church to be desirous enough for their young people to be filled with the Holy Ghost to have a move of God that they'll pitch in and help with the youth camp and so I've been with brother Mike in Costa Rica I've been with him in Nicaragua he sent us as a family to Honduras in 2007 I went to Venezuela with him in 2009 and I have been with him in India five times for these youth camps and so he has poured his life into taking the the desire for young people to have their own experience with the Lord where that they're not relying on their parents experience or their pastors experience but that there would be a genuine move of God where that these young people would really seek for the baptism of the Holy Ghost for themselves I can remember when we went to Costa Rica in 1996 it was a foreign thought to them to go and kneel around the altar and it was the same way in India it took several years for them to have this concept that I can go and I can pray until that I know that I know that I have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the other issue that we have dealt with in these foreign countries is to try to get those that already have the Holy Ghost to come and to pray with these young people they feel like that that's the preachers job well in some of these countries we can't even get the preachers to help us to come and pray whoever did the preaching can do the praying too but as the years have progressed and we go year after year after year now we can get the preachers that are in the building to help us to pray those that already have the Holy Ghost even the the mothers and grandmothers we're seeing more and more that they really have have noticed in in the world the falling away and so it's like it provokes them we've got to help to pray these young people through to the Holy Ghost and that is really the the whole attitude of these youth camps is for young people to get an experience with the Lord that they'll never forget and that will keep them wolf from wandering away from from the Lord from the church but that will keep them strong through the years and I don't think that you can measure the fruit of the youth camp while you're there no Wes gave his heart to the Lord in a youth camp in 1988 the pastor to the church that invited us said that he received the Holy Ghost at the at one of the previous youth camps in Costa Rica and if you had every testimony of everything like that and like one of the young men that it kind of touched me he had only been to the service of the church that that youth camp twice hit someone had recently invited him he had come twice and then they'd invited him to come to the youth camp and when he arrived he was not dressed in appropriate attire and they told him I said that you know you're gonna have to wear pants and and he said well I only have one pair but okay and so he wore his one pair but every night at the altar well I think we said actually in every service at the altar last morning and evening morning and evening that there was a puddle of tears around him you know someone who was totally unchurched who didn't really know the Lord at all and so desperately hungry to connect with the Lord how do you measure that fruit and then a young lady from a home that was split up and and if she lived with her mother or there was always tension because her mother was angry her dad was angry that she's staying with her mother if she stayed with her dad her mom was always angry she and it was always such turmoil in our life and she had sent the pastor a note and said I'm just not coming back to church but she came on to the youth camp and and then she's been in the services since then and seems to be she got now can't think of a word in English for it but you know if I guess of a revival within her to give her the encouragement to press on and to push on in and to make it how do you measure how do you measure that that fruit because I've watched it over and over again how that one wrong decision couldn't take you out of the path and keep you out of the path for years and years and so what if she had stuck with that decision she made on December the 31st and just hadn't ever but now you know that course has been corrected and I know she'll have the opportunity to make that choice again because we continue to come to cross word roads but to give somebody a lift and encouragement to press into the correct path you can't measure that kind of fruit we flew into San Jose currently it's supposed to be summer it's nearer to the equator than we are obviously and it was it was just under 70 degrees Fahrenheit when we got there down in the little town we stayed Grecia and then when we went up on the mountain it had started raining and when it started raining and we got way up on the mountain the wind was also blowing and it felt like winter it was very cold the the camp was a total of six meetings three morning three evening started on Wednesday night ended on Saturday morning I did all of the evening meetings and brother Lindsay did all of the morning meetings and generally the the evening meetings are kind of evangelistic services and the morning meetings are more kind of teaching services this time it was kind of switched around where it seemed like that the morning meetings were evangelistic and the evening meetings were more teaching after you do a bunch of these meetings and you kind of get a feel for the people that are in them and you find out that they're facing the same battles that everybody is facing and you not only want to help them and encourage them to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost but you want to give them some practical teaching that will help them day to day because so many people when they encounter a battle or they trip and fall over something then immediately the the enemy wants to say you don't have the Holy Ghost which I don't think is at all true you you just learned that these kids really just need some basic rubber meets the road kind of teaching to help them in the daily overcoming even for people that have the Holy Ghost you everybody has mine battles everybody is going to encounter something that they trip over and and rather than staying down and and and having everybody kick you as they go by it just find a place to ask the Lord to forgive you and get back up and go again although this was a very small youth camp what did they say 50 campers actually probably four it was very small but there was representation from Costa Rica Nicaragua Honduras Panama and all of these people traveled in to be able to come to this camp the Panamanian people got stuck at the border of Panama and Costa Rica there was one of the girls that didn't have her proper paperwork and they sat at the border for ten hours waiting for that child's parents to bring the necessary paperwork so that she could get across the border to be a part of that youth camp and so before the youth camp forever started there was fighting in the spirit realm to be able to get these children to the youth camp something that impressed the the people in Costa Rica very much was the fact that our lives would pray with the ladies around the altar they had never seen that before or it was something that was that was very uncommon for them to see and it was a great blessing to for them to see our wives praying with people around the altar and not just the preachers the first that was was preaching and we stood up at the end I was next to sister Sharon and I noticed this young lady that was in front of me to my right just sobbing and that's kind of nudge Sharon she kind of glanced at me like what are you doing in this reverent moment nudging me and then I just kind of nudged toward you know pointed toward the girl that was crying and so then when he actually made the altar call Sharon stepped up with her and begin to pray with her and then I went on up to the altar to pray and the girl later poured out her heart to Sharon and she had been away from the Lord not coming to church hurt and like all hurt she had a lot of good reasons to be hurt but you know every time we hurt we have a choice of a response we don't have to run anywhere but to the Lord but so often we want to run away from what we perceive to be the source of the pain and so she had completely gone out she was doing her party thing and even the the weekend before she was at a party she was telling Sharon about it and she said to a young man at the party I've been invited to this Christian camp next week and he said why don't you go she said he looked at her and he said you don't belong here I mean how shocking for that and so then she went through this series of well okay maybe I can got off from work yes you can get off from work and then they come back and say no you can't we've got too much and we depend on you too much and you can't and then she was like okay you know because she didn't have her heart committed to coming at all and she never in her mind she never saw herself coming back to church and serving the Lord again although her mother had been persistently praying for her and telling her that she was then they said well you if you work an extra hour every day so-and-so has agreed to take your place for the for the rest of the time so that opened up the door for her to come and she said well I don't have a way that's you know a good good ways out of San Jose and I don't have a car to drive and then another friend said oh well I have to go right by there I'll just take and drop you off as I Drive and when she got out of the car her other friends said to her you're never gonna be the same after this and she she told Sharon and that she said I don't ever cry and she said in here I've sobbed through the entire sermon and then she told me later she said I kept expecting him to call me by name she said it was so real and so individual for me I thought he was going to speak my name from the pulpit that shows that the Lord is just using us as a vessel it's not of us there's nothing that we're doing and I think to me that's probably the most special thing about it all the ability to get ourselves out of the way and let the Lord do the work through us that is beyond amazing to me so every every service really built one on another talking to the kids about getting things out of their life really talking about the soul realm and of course receiving the Holy Ghost and then maintaining what you've got and and allowing the Holy Spirit to build on that and and not letting it deplete out of your life and every service there were kids in the altar you didn't have to beg them to come to the altar and pray they well even in their seat they they would stand and weep in the presence of the Lord at the end of the service but as as they were finishing praying there came a sound of victory at the end and they didn't want to leave they did young people didn't want well the older people didn't either and that that's they stayed in there and you know some of the ones who start drifting out but a huge group of them just kept singing and and worshiping and praising and it was it was absolutely beautiful and you know what you could feel the love and the unity we did all sorts of neat little children's product projects and you'll find a little video of a girl with beautiful hair out to here but she's telling the story of the five loaves and two fish in Spanish and she does it just she does a beautiful job but they they did a little crafts that matched with the stories that they were studying with and then I had the two to five year olds that I was working with and that was just pure entertainment we had morning service we had evening service and in the afternoon they had activities which I love they had the first day brother layman who would work kind of like a youth pastor and and he did what he called icebreaker activities he was so good with them every single person was involved he divided them into four teams course guys hunt teams girls on teams which it's kind of not the fairest thing in the world when you're playing relay races but anyway the girls held their own on them but he stopped he started out with him in a circle and and they he I don't know what he was saying I was up on the hill I wasn't close enough to try to figure out you know get the serious voice and they were all standing up and they were role in their hands and they were bending down the role in their hands you know what he said that was just a loosening up exercise and then then he had all the girls to put their arms around each other and all the guys and then I don't know what he was saying to get them to do this but it's great you sit on the video he had them humping in a circle this way and then hopping in the circle that way but you know how difficult it is when you're different heights and different and you've got your arms on somebody else in your half and it was great I mean they were all just busting their guts laughing and and then a real life where the guys on one team the girls on one team and they had a balloon and they had to the person in the back passed it all the way up to the person in the front hand over hand and the first in the front come running around and you know like that will you know balloons are not very steady things and the balloon would go flying off and they'd have to get chasing after it and Stefan just laughter and laughter and laughter and now you're there with people you don't know because they're from another country they don't go to your church and you're pulling with them because you're trying you're trying to make your unit your unit your team win and so I think although that was not necessarily spiritual it was spiritual you know any time that we're doing something that's pulling us together in a unity that honors the Lord I think that it that it's a wonderful thing and then but in a second they broke into small groups in which they actually just had discussions a the leader and their small group would bring up something and then you don't want you get one topic going and just having group discussions amongst young people about things that were troubling them or causing them to struggle or that they had questions or they didn't understand and so I found that was beautiful there was an older brother not ancient there was an older brother and you see here my color yeah he was in the meeting 24 years ago a very talented singer very and I have a memory of him singing to God be the glory and it just amazing he sings it in Spanish of course but in the building the church building it reverberated off of the walls it was I just have this memory of it when we saw him he helped to get us to the camp it was very quiet very reserved almost like he was depressed and it took several meetings I think it was Friday before that he even would acknowledge that he would sing but he started singing on Friday night and one of the when I when I took Spanish when she was teaching it one of the things that she insisted was that I learned some songs and so I learned Amazing Grace and okay How Great Thou art in Spanish and when I was in Venezuela in 2009 God used it in a supernatural way but I sang just the course before I preached on Friday night well after the service on Friday night they started singing it again and this brother got up there with the microphone and he started singing and singing and singing it was just like the well came uncapped and and and his depression lifted and Saturday again he sang some more and and when that when the service ended on Saturday morning he sang for another hour after the service ended just the people singing and rejoicing and dancing and happy and joyful because that the Lord had been so good and showed up and moved in and so it wasn't just for the youth and then Sunday morning he sang a special in their church but the pastor said that that Friday night was the first time that he had sung in public since he'd come back to the Lord [Music] and so I really believe the Lord made a breakthrough for him then he invited all of us up to his beautiful house upon a different mountain and and at the end of the evening they sang you know Sharon Sharon played the piano and sister Andrea the pastor's daughter daughter played the piano both of them probably sang for two hours at night oh heavens no I think we sang for four [Laughter] [Music] I felt the supernatural nasaw this trip in every way to start with I've had a prophetic word from the Lord for many years well 20 years that the Lord gave me an anointing for the people of Central and South America and though I have been a couple of times and to Central and South America I never really felt like that that was the time and I feel like that this is the time you know where that there's already an open invitation back with with a tentative time and a tentative reason for coming back because this brother has a desire to not just build his church bigger but for there to be six to ten churches in Costa Rica because right now he said he only knows three or four there's five five messages and what he wants to those five are not all in fellowship he wants to met he doesn't want to build a large Church he would rather have several smaller churches and then them come together for fellowship meetings but he wants to start this outreach to start presenting the gospel to them but I feel like that this time was significant because of reconnection and the real one-on-one fellowship with the pastor and see in his heart his desire to out to reach out to other people outside of the four walls of his church and to to have us to come back and and not only that what I see in this pastor is a heart too Norrish or groom other ministers you know and this is not gonna sound like an applause but really if you think about it does you know when charity would look at her daddy says I'm what husband that's just like daddy and I said charity you cannot this is a few years ago obviously I said you can't expect a 19 year old boy to act like a 40 year old man I said daddy didn't act like daddy does now 20 years ago and the same thing is I think sometimes it can be easy for a pastor as he begins to step into his own maturity to look up at the up-and-coming ones and think well he doesn't have that the maturity to lead but I see him taking those that don't have his maturity but putting them in positions of responsibility and respect which i think is so essential if a man doesn't feel respected he doesn't act respected or respectable you know to a certain extent and I see him putting these people that are still growing of course they're still growing you don't get 20 year-olds really that have the maturity because life teaches you that that somebody that's 40 or 50 has and I really appreciate that I see that yeah he doesn't want to wait til that they're full-grown before what's in both the music ministry and into the teaching ministry I would say I really respect that about him then the brother from Honduras who came to help with the interpreting he interpreted on Friday night for us brother Paco he is from Honduras he is the one who has been going to the jungles of Honduras and Nicaragua and preaching to these people the importance of salvation through Jesus Christ their their Catholic people steeped in the Catholic Church any any that they have is of the Catholic nature and they like there are poor people if they get any help it comes through the Catholic Church so if they leave the Catholic Church it's a hot cost to them and so if they plant their grain and they have a bad year and they don't have anybody then the Catholic Church gives seed to although the Catholics but you can't have any because you're not a part of our church so it's a high cost it's the people leave the Catholic Church he is going to these people and presenting the gospel as well as the message to them to try to get as many of them to understand and be born again by the Spirit of the Lord and so he is going into the jungle of Honduras as well as across the river in Nicaragua and these are extremely poor people and they there is a pastor in in a little village who helps him and he also does some of the travelling but it is it is very remote very difficult they don't even have outhouses they this this brother our interpreter he went to one little place and he asked the lady where's the toilet and her answer was sold so the whole essence of this trip was not just about the youth that was just the avenue to get us there but I believe that it was a much broader spectrum of reconnecting with this pastor with the outreach that he wants to do and then our interpreter and the outreach that he is doing the mission work that he's doing and reconnecting with him because I have not seen him since I was in Nicaragua in 2009 and so it was great to reconnect with him and to such an feel his heart you know the heartbeat of what what he is after because although he is a preacher and has a local pastor his heart is for these people in the jungle of Honduras and Nicaragua you when you talk to him you can just tell this is he would rather be there then to even have been with us where that he had a nice bed and plenty of food he there were there something that was drawing him back to the to the mission work but you could tell he has no personal ambition and and you you watch a man like that and I'm telling you it's like that's the man in heaven that's gonna be exalted it's just you know hit the humility that he carries [Music] please or something but if you can gold you can help send somebody else to see Thanks what you do to send somebody else [Music] ah spits Holy Ghost hardly Bible that what happened no stop it who's going out into the jungle gun it and do something for God instead of building five churches about our chai the neighbors
