[1:04:18] this week uh here on Earth we remember
[1:04:22] the birthday of our sister Roy H I don't
[1:04:25] believe that I know I know that a lot of
[1:04:27] people think their birthdays in heaven
[1:04:29] and so forth but I I don't particularly
[1:04:32] believe that we celebrate birthdays in
[1:04:34] eternity since there's no time but we
[1:04:38] can continue to celebrate their life and
[1:04:40] their memory and what they mean to us
[1:04:43] and uh we certainly miss our sister and
[1:04:46] then on Friday of this week
[1:04:49] Josiah um has a birthday let's see how
[1:04:52] old are you going to be
[1:04:54] 28 that's still pretty young I have
[1:04:57] socks that are 28 years old so that's
[1:05:00] young and they're still good I still
[1:05:02] wear them so that's good uh I don't know
[1:05:07] that she's probably in her own shirts
[1:05:09] this morning but uh if if uh Hannah
[1:05:12] kinzer would happen to see this during
[1:05:14] the week we wish her a very happy
[1:05:16] birthday on Friday and we love her and
[1:05:19] her family very much we're glad to be in
[1:05:21] the presence of the Lord we want to go
[1:05:24] to the Lord in prayer again before we
[1:05:26] approach the word we are deeply
[1:05:29] concerned about the nation of Israel
[1:05:32] today and uh feeling a little emotional
[1:05:36] uh so many of our friends who live in
[1:05:38] the land are are making their way out of
[1:05:41] the land and uh I'm asking the Lord to
[1:05:44] make a way for me to get to the land and
[1:05:47] they're asking God to make a way for
[1:05:48] them to get out of the land we were
[1:05:50] scheduled to leave on the 30th of this
[1:05:52] month to spend a couple couple of weeks
[1:05:55] there things have surely shifted and uh
[1:05:59] I I guess you heard the news in the
[1:06:01] night that Israel uh did a couple of
[1:06:04] strikes on the uh airports in uh in uh
[1:06:09] Syria one being Damascus did you know
[1:06:12] there's one verse of scripture in the
[1:06:14] Old Testament that we know for sure has
[1:06:16] never come to pass there's several that
[1:06:19] we feel like may not have had their
[1:06:21] actual fulfillment yet but one is the
[1:06:24] scripture uh prophesies the total
[1:06:28] annihilation of the city of Damascus and
[1:06:31] in the history of Damascus there's never
[1:06:33] been a time that the whole city fell we
[1:06:36] may be living in those days we may be
[1:06:40] quickly approaching the hour that God
[1:06:43] ultimately deals with those who have
[1:06:45] oppressed his will for so long we stand
[1:06:49] with the nation of Israel she is not
[1:06:52] perfect we know that the Jew Jewish
[1:06:54] people are not perfect people we know
[1:06:56] that the government of Israel has made
[1:06:58] many mistakes do you know why because
[1:07:00] men are in the leadership and where we
[1:07:03] get involved we can make mistakes but we
[1:07:06] know that God has called the New
[1:07:08] Testament Church to stand with the
[1:07:11] restored Jewish state of Israel it's our
[1:07:14] It's Our obligation it's our
[1:07:17] responsibility it's our privilege to do
[1:07:19] so because the Bible says that if we
[1:07:22] stand with her and bless her we shall
[1:07:25] also be partakers of her blessing so we
[1:07:28] get the benefit it's very
[1:07:31] unpopular uh anti-Semitism has risen
[1:07:34] since the War uh some some are
[1:07:36] predicting
[1:07:38] 2100% in the world
[1:07:41] 2100% uh you heard about the uh the the
[1:07:45] lady who played a very important role in
[1:07:48] in her synagogue who was stabbed to
[1:07:50] death in our
[1:07:52] country in our country yesterday because
[1:07:55] she's Jewish and uh the pro
[1:07:58] Palestinian uh celebrations and what do
[1:08:02] they call them demonstrations are
[1:08:04] increasing Even in our nation and uh we
[1:08:07] should pray for the safety of the Jewish
[1:08:10] people we should pray that God hides
[1:08:13] them I I watched an interview yesterday
[1:08:16] of a holocaust Survivor who was 9 years
[1:08:19] old at Crystal KN the night that uh that
[1:08:23] changed the history of the world it it
[1:08:26] became illegal to be a Jew in one night
[1:08:30] and uh over 100 Jewish men were murdered
[1:08:34] that first day businesses were
[1:08:36] destroyed it seems that we are
[1:08:39] approaching another another time and we
[1:08:42] need to be prayed up and we need to know
[1:08:45] the heart and the mind of the Lord for
[1:08:47] Israel and we need to be bold in our
[1:08:51] stand if you have a voice use it you're
[1:08:55] standing for God's word when you stand
[1:08:57] for the nation of Israel use your voice
[1:09:01] if you've got social media use it for
[1:09:03] something more important than just
[1:09:05] showing a picture of your supper you
[1:09:08] know people don't really care what you
[1:09:09] ate last night but we care if you'll
[1:09:12] take a stand for God's word I care about
[1:09:15] that and so we're just going to believe
[1:09:18] that uh that God will protect his people
[1:09:20] as he promised and I believe that Israel
[1:09:23] is going in for a for a a ground assault
[1:09:27] I believe it's the only way that she can
[1:09:29] bring an end to part of these problems
[1:09:31] we had the opportunity to do so in
[1:09:35] 2006 when they when they kidnapped one
[1:09:38] person one young Soldier and now we're
[1:09:41] dealing with over 200 who are being held
[1:09:44] captive if if you have been watching the
[1:09:47] the real news in the last few days um
[1:09:51] you will have read that that there are
[1:09:54] more and more reports coming out about
[1:09:57] the mutilation of the bodies that were
[1:10:03] found it's very difficult to hear it's
[1:10:07] very difficult to
[1:10:09] read and uh I know that so many voices
[1:10:13] out there say that it's not true but all
[1:10:16] you have to do is listen to The Men Who
[1:10:19] found the
[1:10:20] bodies and I don't know if you know this
[1:10:22] or not but a message believer
[1:10:24] is one of the soldiers in the Israeli
[1:10:26] Army who found some of the mutilated
[1:10:28] bodies a believer of this truth is one
[1:10:31] of the soldiers in the IDF in fact his
[1:10:34] picture was on the front page of what
[1:10:36] was the the New York Post and the shock
[1:10:40] on his face and the tears in his eyes
[1:10:43] it's it's
[1:10:47] animalistic I I know it's quiet in here
[1:10:50] but it's
[1:10:51] animalistic you know rape is just un
[1:10:54] there there's just no Toleration for it
[1:10:56] but but the thought of of taking
[1:10:58] advantage of a
[1:11:00] corpse is just more than I can stand and
[1:11:03] the thought of gouging someone's eyes
[1:11:06] out just to prove that you have them in
[1:11:09] a vulnerable place and this is just the
[1:11:12] beginning of the torture that many of
[1:11:14] those people have experienced and then
[1:11:16] there are those who don't believe it's
[1:11:18] demonic it's absolutely a demonic Force
[1:11:22] Hamas is controlled by a demonic Force
[1:11:25] the same anointing that fell on
[1:11:28] Hitler and we must pray that God look
[1:11:32] these are my
[1:11:34] people they're your
[1:11:36] people and uh I personally feel
[1:11:40] connected my great-grandparents were
[1:11:42] Jews from Lithuania they came to this
[1:11:45] nation hoping for a better life and hid
[1:11:48] their religion they hid their faith so
[1:11:51] that they could survive and they ended
[1:11:53] up owning a newspaper in in Raleigh
[1:11:56] North Carolina and being being quite
[1:11:58] successful at it but longing for home
[1:12:01] and longing for Faith and longing to be
[1:12:05] able to tell your neighbors who you are
[1:12:07] but so
[1:12:08] traumatized by what they had been
[1:12:10] through so um you know just be careful
[1:12:14] in in these uncertain times where you
[1:12:17] stand um because we believe that nations
[1:12:21] are are not judged
[1:12:24] by how many Christians they have but the
[1:12:27] Bible tells us that nations are going to
[1:12:29] be judged by how they stand with Israel
[1:12:33] the difference between a sheep nation
[1:12:35] and a goat nation is not how many
[1:12:37] Christians live there but the difference
[1:12:40] between a sheep nation and a goat Nation
[1:12:42] are those who stand for Israel are
[1:12:44] called Sheep Nations and those who
[1:12:47] reject her purpose or called goat
[1:12:49] Nations and the Judgment of the Lord is
[1:12:51] not just for tribulation period it's
[1:12:54] beyond Millennium and Eternity we want
[1:12:57] to we want to land on the right side of
[1:12:59] this anybody with me all right let's
[1:13:03] stand again we're going to go to the
[1:13:05] Lord we're going to pray our hearts get
[1:13:08] heavy I wake up in the night calling out
[1:13:11] for God's grace and his
[1:13:14] protection we have so many loved ones
[1:13:17] and so many friends that are there and
[1:13:21] uh I can't imagine this week our uh
[1:13:25] those the the young family that's living
[1:13:27] in our apartment this week they're going
[1:13:29] to try to leave the country on Tuesday
[1:13:32] would you pray that if it's God's will
[1:13:34] he'll make a way for them to get out and
[1:13:37] the main reason is because their little
[1:13:40] children are being so traumatized by
[1:13:43] having to constantly take them in and
[1:13:45] out of the bomb shelter and it's just
[1:13:48] hard to explain to little bitty children
[1:13:50] why you have to go spend hours in a
[1:13:52] little confined space and they're
[1:13:55] becoming quite agitated and so uh
[1:13:58] they're hoping to be able to get out for
[1:14:00] a little bit of a break and and we don't
[1:14:03] condemn them for that uh judge them no
[1:14:05] sir they need to do what is what is good
[1:14:08] for their family but we remember those
[1:14:10] who won't have that privilege who
[1:14:12] wouldn't be able to leave I doubt I can
[1:14:15] sing it but uh do you remember the
[1:14:18] Little Chorus we used to sing oh Lord

[1:14:22] Israel

[1:18:14] people we pray for Israeli
[1:18:17] Arabs who live as citizens of the
[1:18:21] land who are fearful for their future
[1:18:25] Lord Lord we are not about death and it
[1:18:29] breaks our heart to hear of the
[1:18:32] suffering on either side of the conflict
[1:18:36] but scripture demands that we take a
[1:18:40] stand with your word all we know is that
[1:18:43] you're a God that keeps Covenant you are
[1:18:47] not a God that you should lie you're not
[1:18:50] a man that you should lie neither the
[1:18:52] son of man that that you would have need
[1:18:53] to repent and your word has made an
[1:18:57] unconditional Everlasting Covenant with
[1:19:00] your people you told us in your word
[1:19:03] that you're not only married to the
[1:19:05] people but you are married to the land
[1:19:08] AR it's Israel you're married to the
[1:19:11] dirt and you made a promise with your
[1:19:14] people and Lord we know that the day is
[1:19:18] coming that the blindness of Israel will
[1:19:21] be removed and they will see the scars
[1:19:24] in your hand and the Bible says all
[1:19:27] Israel shall be saved we stand on the
[1:19:31] promise of Romans chap 11 and we pray oh
[1:19:35] God that your hand will catch the
[1:19:38] missiles that the Iron Dome misses we
[1:19:42] pray that you will show yourself again
[1:19:45] the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and
[1:19:49] that you will wrap your loving arms
[1:19:51] around the the precious Jewish people
[1:19:54] wherever they are in this trying hour
[1:19:58] God we pray for the
[1:20:00] hostages Lord we ask that you will make
[1:20:03] a way where there is no way that you
[1:20:08] will give direction and intelligence and
[1:20:11] wisdom and
[1:20:13] Leadership and that there will be many
[1:20:16] survivors Who come out from among those
[1:20:19] hostages to testify that you are a God
[1:20:23] who watches over Israel and you neither
[1:20:25] slumber nor sleep we pray for the
[1:20:28] protection of the Jewish people in the
[1:20:31] nations of the diaspora in every
[1:20:34] scattered nation of the world we ask
[1:20:36] that you would cover them Lord and that
[1:20:39] you would stir in them in this hour a
[1:20:43] desire to go
[1:20:45] home they have become very comfortable
[1:20:48] in Europe and very comfortable in the
[1:20:51] United States and yet your word says
[1:20:55] that in order to have a part of the
[1:20:56] covenantal promise they must occupy the
[1:21:00] land so may The Same Spirit that Drew
[1:21:04] them there so many years ago on the
[1:21:08] wings of eagles the rabbis noted we pray
[1:21:12] that you will draw them home for such a
[1:21:15] time as
[1:21:19] this Lord I espcially pray for my dear
[1:21:24] friend Dove who has both a son and a
[1:21:27] daughter who are serving on the front
[1:21:30] lines in the South I ask you to watch
[1:21:35] over them and keep
[1:21:37] them he has sold out his comfortable
[1:21:40] life in this nation to stand
[1:21:43] unconditionally with your people he is
[1:21:46] truly a lion in Judah would you bless
[1:21:49] the work of his hands and protect his
[1:21:52] precious children to the glory of
[1:21:56] God lord you told us that there was a
[1:21:59] bride hidden behind the veil of Islam
[1:22:03] Lord my heart goes out to those who
[1:22:06] don't know
[1:22:08] you when we remember Hamas we remember
[1:22:12] that the Palestinian people chose them
[1:22:16] in an election in 2006 to represent them
[1:22:21] and therefore or there are very few
[1:22:24] innocent
[1:22:26] Palestinians they like Israel chose the
[1:22:29] wrong
[1:22:30] leadership and have paid an ultimate
[1:22:33] price but Lord if there's
[1:22:37] one if there's one that you had on your
[1:22:40] mind before the foundation of the world
[1:22:44] if there's one that you shed your blood
[1:22:46] for I pray that you will reach that one
[1:22:51] and any that are connected Lord to that
[1:22:53] one that they might find you in their
[1:22:57] fear that they might find you in their
[1:23:00] time of Calamity may they know that
[1:23:03] Allah is a farce he is not the god of
[1:23:06] the Bible he is not the god of Abraham
[1:23:09] Isaac and Jacob he represents a false
[1:23:12] god May their eyes be opened and may
[1:23:15] they see that you are the
[1:23:18] deliverer that you are the one that
[1:23:21] extends your hand of mercy upon whom you
[1:23:25] will we ask this in the most lovely name
[1:23:29] of our Messiah bashem Adonai Yeshua

[1:26:01] the wrong church this morning no doubt
[1:26:02] about it Revelation 5:1 and I saw in the
[1:26:07] right hand of him that sat on the throne
[1:26:11] a book written within and on the
[1:26:17] backside
[1:26:18] sealed with Seven Seals now most
[1:26:23] translations of this verse are true to
[1:26:27] the King James in indicating that the
[1:26:31] scroll was written on inside and
[1:26:36] backside and sealed with Seven Seals and
[1:26:40] I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a
[1:26:44] loud voice who is worthy to open the
[1:26:48] book and to loose the seal thereof and
[1:26:53] no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither
[1:26:58] under the Earth was able to open the
[1:27:01] book neither to look thereon let me
[1:27:04] pause just a moment and say not your

[1:27:15] brandham no man that's no man was
[1:27:20] worthy we love Servants of God we love
[1:27:24] the Ministers of Christ but when it came
[1:27:27] to opening up this book no man alive or
[1:27:32] dead was worthy to open the book neither
[1:27:36] to even look at the book John said in
[1:27:40] verse four and I wept
[1:27:44] much because no man was found worthy to
[1:27:48] open and to read the book neither to
[1:27:51] look
[1:27:52] thereon and one of the elders remember
[1:27:55] there are 24 Elders here one of the
[1:27:58] elders said unto me weep
[1:28:00] not Behold The Lion of the tribe of
[1:28:06] Judah the root of David hath prevailed
[1:28:11] to open the book and not only to open
[1:28:14] the book but to loose the Seven Seals
[1:28:18] thereof verse 11 and I beheld and I
[1:28:23] heard the voice of many angels round
[1:28:26] about the throne and the Beast remember
[1:28:29] the four living creatures were there and
[1:28:32] the elders and the number of them was
[1:28:36] 10,000 times
[1:28:39] 10,000 plus thousands of
[1:28:43] thousands we have no way of knowing what
[1:28:46] this number really was but let us
[1:28:49] suffice to say it was a huge crowd and
[1:28:53] they were crying with a loud voice
[1:28:56] worthy worthy they weren't Whispering
[1:28:59] their praise help me you know they they
[1:29:02] weren't Whispering their praise they
[1:29:04] were crying with a loud voice
[1:29:07] worthy let me hear somebody say
[1:29:10] Worthy is the Lamb that was slain he is
[1:29:15] worthy to receive power and riches and
[1:29:18] wisdom and strength and honor and Glory
[1:29:22] and blessing all of this praise and
[1:29:25] every creature which is in heaven and on
[1:29:28] the earth and under the Earth and such
[1:29:32] as are in the sea and all that are in
[1:29:35] them heard I saying blessing and honor
[1:29:40] and Glory you know we should just say
[1:29:42] this together while we're reading let's
[1:29:44] read it together blessing and honor and
[1:29:48] glory and power be unto him that sth
[1:29:52] upon the throne and unto the lamb

[1:30:14] agreement with the heavenly host and
[1:30:17] give the lamb the praise that deser that
[1:30:19] he deserves you may be seated may God
[1:30:22] add his Blessing to the reading of his
[1:30:24] word I I want to I want to preach this
[1:30:27] morning in the time that I have W with
[1:30:31] this title buying property in a war
[1:30:36] zone buying property in a war zone I'm
[1:30:41] going to Jeremiah chapter 32 now I've
[1:30:45] been preaching 48 years that's my entire
[1:30:49] life nearly and I have never preached a
[1:30:53] message specifically in Jeremiah chap 32
[1:30:58] but I want to use Jeremiah chapter 32 as
[1:31:02] the foundation for the subject buying
[1:31:06] property in a war zone it doesn't make a
[1:31:09] lot of sense would you agree to buy
[1:31:12] property in a war
[1:31:14] zone if you know that there is an
[1:31:16] occupying Army on the horizon why would
[1:31:20] you waste your money in an hour like
[1:31:23] that but God has a purpose God has a
[1:31:27] reason in Jeremiah 32 verses 1-5 it's on
[1:31:32] the board the word that came to Jeremiah
[1:31:36] from the Lord in the 10th year of
[1:31:40] zedekiah king of Judah which was the
[1:31:44] 18th year of Nebuchadnezzar who is the
[1:31:49] king of of Babylon for then the king of
[1:31:53] babylon's army besieged Jerusalem and
[1:31:57] Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the
[1:32:01] court of the prison which was in the
[1:32:03] king of judah's house so make sure you
[1:32:07] get the foundation of this of this
[1:32:09] chapter Jeremiah the prophet is in
[1:32:13] prison yes he's not in prison because
[1:32:16] he's stolen money he's not in prison
[1:32:19] because he has abused somebody with his
[1:32:23] with his action but he's in prison
[1:32:26] because he prophesied an unpopular word
[1:32:29] from the Lord a and even the king who
[1:32:32] who wasn't so opposed to Jeremiah said I
[1:32:36] I think for your own protection we
[1:32:38] better lock you up now we go on to find
[1:32:42] what this prophecy was was about for
[1:32:45] zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up
[1:32:48] saying wherefore Dost thou Pro prophesy
[1:32:52] and say thus saith the Lord behold I
[1:32:58] will give this city into the hand of the
[1:33:01] king of Babylon and he shall take it so
[1:33:07] Jeremiah must have seemed like a
[1:33:10] traitor God was speaking some
[1:33:13] unfavorable things to
[1:33:15] Israel specifically to the people of
[1:33:19] Judah we know that the kingdom was
[1:33:22] divided and zedekiah king of Judah shall
[1:33:26] not Escape out of the hand of the calans
[1:33:30] now you see why he was upset because
[1:33:33] Jeremiah has not only prophesied that
[1:33:36] you're going to lose Jerusalem but he
[1:33:39] has now prophesied that the king of
[1:33:42] Judah is is going to be taken by the
[1:33:47] calans but shall surely be delivered
[1:33:50] into the hand of the king of Babylon his
[1:33:53] trouble was just beginning are you
[1:33:56] following me but he said and shall speak
[1:33:59] with him mouth to mouth and his eyes
[1:34:03] Shall Behold his eyes basically the word
[1:34:06] to the King was this I'm going to give
[1:34:09] you an audience with the king of Babylon
[1:34:12] that's not necessarily a bad thing but
[1:34:15] zedekiah wasn't very happy about it do
[1:34:17] you follow me stay with me now and he
[1:34:21] shall lead zedekiah to Babylon and there
[1:34:25] shall he be until I visit him sayth the
[1:34:29] Lord though ye fight with the calans ye
[1:34:34] shall not
[1:34:36] Prosper now zedekiah must have
[1:34:40] wondered whose side is Jeremiah on who
[1:34:45] are you for you're supposed to be an
[1:34:48] Israelite you're supposed to be for
[1:34:51] Judah you're supposed to stand with the
[1:34:54] Hebrew people but now you have brought a
[1:34:57] word from the Lord that says that the
[1:35:01] king I'm going to be taken captive by
[1:35:04] the calans delivered into the hand of
[1:35:07] the king of Babylon and I'm going to be
[1:35:10] carried away as a hostage to the city of
[1:35:14] Babylon and we'll remain there until the
[1:35:16] Lord visits Israel again I'm not real
[1:35:19] happy with that kind of a word Jeremiah
[1:35:22] so if you don't mind step into my
[1:35:25] prison stay with me step into my prison
[1:35:29] I'm going to lock you up because you
[1:35:31] can't be trusted but who in this house
[1:35:34] knows that you can't lock up the word of
[1:35:36] the
[1:35:37] Lord you you can turn the lock and throw
[1:35:40] away the key but you can't keep the KN
[1:35:42] word of the Lord from coming forth from
[1:35:45] the mouth of the Prophet the word of God
[1:35:48] bubbles in him the scripture says it
[1:35:51] bubbles in him until it finds a way to
[1:35:54] get out and it doesn't have to be spoken
[1:35:57] to the multitudes to come to pass it can
[1:36:00] be spoken alone in a prison house but as
[1:36:04] soon as the word of the Lord is released
[1:36:07] into the atmosphere the heavenly host
[1:36:11] the angels of the glor of the Lord
[1:36:14] rush they rush to assist the word you
[1:36:19] see the Heavenly Host they serve the
[1:36:21] word yes somebody said I thought they
[1:36:24] sered the Lord isn't that who the Lord
[1:36:26] is John 1:1 in the beginning was the
[1:36:29] word and the Word was with
[1:36:33] God and the Word was
[1:36:35] God down further and the word 14 or
[1:36:38] whatever the verse is and the word
[1:36:40] became flesh so Jesus was the son of God
[1:36:44] but he was the Living Word and so the
[1:36:48] angels of the Lord are assigned to to
[1:36:51] serve the word so it doesn't matter if
[1:36:55] they're announced in the Public Square
[1:36:57] or Fox News or in the newspaper or in
[1:37:01] the church house or in a closet
[1:37:04] somewhere with the door locked and all
[1:37:06] the windows shut when God
[1:37:09] speaks we're not cessationist here I
[1:37:12] want you to know we don't believe that
[1:37:14] God lost his
[1:37:15] tongue no we believe he still speaks the
[1:37:20] Bible said his as many as are led by the
[1:37:22] spirit they are the sons of God and if
[1:37:26] he leads you he ought to be able to talk
[1:37:28] to you and you ought to be able to know
[1:37:30] his voice Jesus said I'm the Good
[1:37:32] Shepherd and the Sheep know my voice so
[1:37:35] I don't support churches who believe
[1:37:37] that healing is for only for the
[1:37:40] apostles and I don't support groups who
[1:37:42] believe that the gifts of the Spirit are
[1:37:44] all finished because something more
[1:37:47] perfect has come I'm not supporting that
[1:37:51] he's still a walking talking God he's
[1:37:54] still able to speak a word let me tell
[1:37:56] you something a prayer that's prayed in
[1:37:59] this house in faith can shift the
[1:38:02] Nations that's what the scripture tells
[1:38:05] us somebody said well I don't believe
[1:38:06] that then why do you
[1:38:08] pray if you don't believe that prayer
[1:38:10] can shift
[1:38:12] things why do you pray so we do believe
[1:38:15] that when the word of the Lord comes out
[1:38:18] when it gets out into the atmosphere
[1:38:21] spere doesn't matter who hears it that's
[1:38:24] right doesn't matter who amens it the
[1:38:27] Angels attach themselves the Heavenly
[1:38:31] Host attach themselves they watch over
[1:38:35] the word the Bible tells us to see that
[1:38:37] it is brought to pass and may I tell you
[1:38:40] that no devil in
[1:38:43] hell not a Putin in the
[1:38:48] Kremlin as we learned some years ago not
[1:38:51] the Arafat in
[1:38:54] rala as we have learned many times
[1:38:57] through the years not a Hitler not a
[1:39:00] Stalin not a
[1:39:03] melini can stand against the word of the
[1:39:06] Lord When God says
[1:39:11] it you see now I'm not one of th those
[1:39:14] who has to add something to that I
[1:39:18] understand that uh some of the message
[1:39:20] believer
[1:39:21] you know they'll say God said it brother
[1:39:23] brandom spoke it I believe it I don't
[1:39:26] have to have that if God said
[1:39:33] it if God said it that settles
[1:39:36] it you see God can
[1:39:39] talk and I'm thankful for prophets I'm
[1:39:43] thankful for a five-fold Ministry I'm
[1:39:46] thankful for faithful believers who will
[1:39:49] parot the word of the Lord who will
[1:39:51] serve like microphones and declare and
[1:39:54] release the word of the Lord but I want
[1:39:56] you to know whether you believe it or
[1:40:00] not if God says
[1:40:04] it somebody told me this week I don't
[1:40:07] believe Israel will ever occupy all the
[1:40:10] land that God said they would oh yes
[1:40:14] they
[1:40:15] will you may be rotten right you may be
[1:40:19] a pile of dust but the day will come and
[1:40:22] you will know it that every piece of
[1:40:25] dirt that God promised to the
[1:40:27] descendants of Abraham will belong to
[1:40:30] them and so much more because God is not
[1:40:34] a man that he should lie neither the son
[1:40:36] of man that he would have need to
[1:40:38] repent you see the problem and I'm going
[1:40:40] to get off the the political part of
[1:40:42] this issue because I want to talk to you
[1:40:44] about something spiritual but I I I
[1:40:47] thought my is amazing how this kind of
[1:40:49] flows with the with the situation ation
[1:40:51] that we're facing right now the
[1:40:52] Jordanian people do not want the
[1:40:55] Palestinian people because they know
[1:40:58] that they're Wild by
[1:41:01] Nature they're both Arab and both
[1:41:06] Islamic both Muslim countries are are
[1:41:09] Muslim people believe in Allah and serve
[1:41:12] the same kind of Faith but they have
[1:41:16] learned that this is a PE well the Bible
[1:41:19] if you could just read the Bible the
[1:41:21] Bible would tell you that Ishmael the
[1:41:24] son of Hagar the the the prophecy that
[1:41:28] God released over his seed I'm not going
[1:41:31] to kill
[1:41:32] you you see the little baby could have
[1:41:34] died in the wilderness but God sent an
[1:41:37] angel to Hagar and protected her and
[1:41:41] protected
[1:41:43] Ishmael because remember what brother
[1:41:45] random told us he said Satan is just a
[1:41:49] tool in the hand of God to perfect the
[1:41:52] Saints and so God knows how to use the
[1:41:56] ishmaelites to get Israel where they
[1:41:58] need to
[1:41:59] be so that he can bring his promised
[1:42:02] word to pass if you're with me say Amen
[1:42:05] so God made sure not only did Abraham
[1:42:07] pack a little Supply to keep Ishmael
[1:42:10] alive but God made sure he sent an angel
[1:42:13] of the Lord to to watch over Hagar to
[1:42:16] watch over Ishmael he said no Abraham
[1:42:19] I'm not going to let him be the promised
[1:42:21] son I've already got a promised son but
[1:42:25] what I will do is I'll let him survive I
[1:42:27] will let him multiply but I need to tell
[1:42:30] you something about him he's going to
[1:42:32] represent a wild man he's going to be
[1:42:35] like a a wild ass that cannot be
[1:42:41] tamed what other kind of nature pokes
[1:42:44] people's eyes out and rapes the
[1:42:47] dead but the nature of a wild ass does
[1:42:50] that bother you for me to cuss I'm just
[1:42:53] King James today is that all right if
[1:42:55] you want to say a wild donkey but
[1:42:57] somehow it just does something to me to
[1:42:59] be able to say wild ass so pray for me
[1:43:02] that I can get more Sanctified there's
[1:43:05] something wrong with the people who
[1:43:08] thrive in such confusion as they and so
[1:43:13] Jordan says we don't want them and Egypt
[1:43:16] is is wild I want you to know as a
[1:43:18] nation politically I I was in Egypt just
[1:43:22] a few years ago for the third time and I
[1:43:24] wanted out I wanted out about 10 minutes
[1:43:27] after I got there Chad was with me and
[1:43:30] he can tell you that is not a place that
[1:43:33] you want to be in this hour there's an
[1:43:35] atmosphere there that is that is so
[1:43:38] volatile that it feels like any minute
[1:43:41] the whole thing could explode like a
[1:43:43] powder keg I wanted out I didn't even
[1:43:47] care if I saw the pyramids again just
[1:43:50] let me get out you can feel it in the
[1:43:53] atmosphere but Egypt has said we don't
[1:43:56] want
[1:43:56] them in fact all of the neighboring
[1:44:00] nations of Arab League have all said we
[1:44:04] don't want them so you're going to be
[1:44:06] forced to put up with their
[1:44:11] terrorism you know God doesn't look at
[1:44:13] it the same as man does God said any
[1:44:17] minute when all the details lined up
[1:44:21] according to my great provision I'm
[1:44:23] going to do exactly what I told Abraham
[1:44:26] I was going to do I'm going to give him
[1:44:28] the land and if there are savable seed I
[1:44:32] know this is too much for some folks
[1:44:34] here but if there are savable seed among
[1:44:37] the Palestinians they will have the same
[1:44:40] opportunity for salvation that you
[1:44:43] have and only God can look and know that
[1:44:47] you see I'm one of those who believes
[1:44:49] that every soul that was ever going to
[1:44:51] be saved was in the mind of God before
[1:44:54] the foundation of the world and he
[1:44:57] already knew how many Jews were going to
[1:44:59] find their way out of the
[1:45:01] blindness until the day that National
[1:45:04] blindness is removed and only God knows
[1:45:07] how many Arab people how many
[1:45:09] Palestinian how many people of the
[1:45:11] Nations will will make their way in but
[1:45:13] he knows and you can trust him so
[1:45:17] Jeremiah is in prison for prophesying an
[1:45:20] unpopular prophecy now keep in mind that
[1:45:24] God's Talk is sometimes crazy
[1:45:27] talk I know that sounds disrespectful to
[1:45:30] some but God's talk can be crazy
[1:45:34] talk I I don't think you're agreeing
[1:45:36] with me so God must have never picked
[1:45:39] you up in the middle of the night a away
[1:45:41] and caused you to leave everything you
[1:45:43] knew and were familiar with to follow
[1:45:45] his voice he he must have never reached
[1:45:48] it because if he's done that if God
[1:45:50] relocated you by the spirit on if God
[1:45:54] told you to leave everything behind
[1:45:55] that's unfamiliar and follow his voice
[1:45:57] you ought to know that God's Talk is
[1:46:00] sometimes crazy talk it doesn't make
[1:46:03] sense to the human reasoning and that's
[1:46:06] why you and I have to shut down sometime
[1:46:08] our human reasoning and we have to say
[1:46:11] Amen so be
[1:46:15] it so be it in Earth even as it is in
[1:46:19] heaven because you see he can not only
[1:46:21] be Jehovah Gyra and Jehovah Rafa come on
[1:46:25] and Jehovah
[1:46:29] ni he can also be sometimes Jehovah
[1:46:34] sneaky he knows more than you and I know
[1:46:38] he sees more than you and I see and he
[1:46:41] can build and build and build to
[1:46:43] something until it just begins to Spring
[1:46:46] forth and come to pass so I want you to
[1:46:49] understand where we are this was the
[1:46:51] 11th year of King zedekiah excuse me
[1:46:55] this was uh we are in the 11th year of
[1:46:59] King Hezekiah zedekiah when Jerusalem
[1:47:02] fell so we are almost at the point where
[1:47:05] the city of Jerusalem fell to the calans
[1:47:08] and the Babylonians and they were
[1:47:10] carried away captive for 70 years so
[1:47:14] when Jeremiah is getting this unpopular
[1:47:17] prophecy the city is about to be
[1:47:19] forfeited into the hands of
[1:47:21] Nebuchadnezzar the king of the city of
[1:47:24] Babylon he was a caldan by nationality
[1:47:27] and so we understand that Babylonians
[1:47:30] are a subset of calans they are almost
[1:47:34] the same because because all Babylonians
[1:47:38] are caldan but all caldan were not
[1:47:41] Babylonians do you understand Cala is an
[1:47:45] area to the South and to the east of the
[1:47:48] city of Babylon at times the entire
[1:47:52] Babylonian Empire was referred to as
[1:47:57] Cala now I want you to look at Jeremiah
[1:47:59] 32 and I've got to move Jeremiah
[1:48:03] 32: 6-1 15 this would be a good place
[1:48:07] for me to save my
[1:48:11] voice and let's see if elas has learned
[1:48:14] his
[1:48:17] lesson did you hear them they're they're
[1:48:19] in intersection for you they said Lord
[1:48:22] help elas
[1:48:24] please so Pastor doesn't humiliate him
[1:48:27] further now I want you to read this like
[1:48:29] a preacher are you ready go and Jeremiah
[1:48:35] said the word of the Lord came unto me
[1:48:37] saying that's good behold hanil hanil
[1:48:42] the son of Shalom thine Uncle shall come
[1:48:45] unto thee saying buy thee my field that
[1:48:49] is in and Nao for the right of the
[1:48:52] Redemption is thine to buy it now hold
[1:48:54] on just a minute I want you to
[1:48:56] understand what happens God spoke to the
[1:48:59] prophet and he said to Jeremiah and he
[1:49:03] said your cousin is going to come the
[1:49:06] son of your uncle he's going to come and
[1:49:08] he's going to ask you to buy a field
[1:49:12] that is an
[1:49:14] anoth a a and you have the right of
[1:49:18] redemption to buy it how many of you
[1:49:20] understand the right of redemption read
[1:49:22] the book of Ruth and you'll understand
[1:49:24] something about that Kinsman redeemers
[1:49:26] ship read
[1:49:29] on so hanil so hanil mine uncle's son
[1:49:34] came to me in the court of the prison he
[1:49:36] had to come to the
[1:49:38] prison to even see him to make this
[1:49:41] proposition read on according to the
[1:49:44] word of the Lord and said unto me by my
[1:49:48] field I pray thee that that in aninth
[1:49:51] which is in the country of Benjamin for
[1:49:53] the right of inheritance is thine and
[1:49:56] the Redemption is thine B it for thyself
[1:49:59] then I knew that this was the word of
[1:50:01] the Lord how did he know it was the word
[1:50:03] of the Lord because exactly what the
[1:50:05] Lord told him came to pass the Lord said
[1:50:08] your cousin's going to come he's going
[1:50:09] to offer you a piece of land I want you
[1:50:12] to buy the land so here he came here
[1:50:16] came Han's cousin and he said I want you
[1:50:18] to buy this piece of land notice it is
[1:50:21] in anoth which is in the country of
[1:50:24] Benjamin now you know that the land is
[1:50:27] divided can you show us that that map
[1:50:29] and let's look at that real
[1:50:33] quick this this I this is actually not
[1:50:36] the map thank you so much I I didn't
[1:50:37] send you the right map if you uh look in
[1:50:41] your Bibles perhaps you may have a map
[1:50:44] uh if not you can certainly look it up
[1:50:47] but it will show you the land that was
[1:50:50] was a lotted to the different tribes how
[1:50:52] many of you know that so the the entire
[1:50:55] uh area of Jerusalem and Hebron all the
[1:51:00] way down toward the neev which is the
[1:51:03] desert in Israel down toward where the
[1:51:05] remone crater is and just to the east is
[1:51:11] that it yes great great now you can look
[1:51:15] the 12 tribes of Israel you see the
[1:51:19] different place places that are allotted
[1:51:21] to the different tribes look at that
[1:51:24] area there of of B Judah is a big piece
[1:51:28] of land it goes all the way down but the
[1:51:31] land of Benjamin see where it is it's
[1:51:33] right near Jerusalem and we know from
[1:51:37] history that the entire land of Benjamin
[1:51:41] had already been lost to the
[1:51:43] Babylonians so the cousin was offering
[1:51:47] to sell a piece of land that was already
[1:51:51] under the control and authority of the
[1:51:54] enemy who in the world would buy a piece
[1:51:57] of property in a war
[1:52:00] zone all of us yes sir if God told us to
[1:52:05] you better you better be one of those
[1:52:07] that understands that God may ask you to
[1:52:09] do some silly
[1:52:13] things you may pass panhandlers every
[1:52:16] day of the week and then one day you
[1:52:18] come up to the intersection and the says
[1:52:20] give that man
[1:52:22] something and you know it's him and you
[1:52:24] don't hesitate you didn't do it the day
[1:52:27] before and you may not do it tomorrow
[1:52:29] but today you're going to do it because
[1:52:32] the spirit of the Lord LED you to do it
[1:52:36] you don't have to know the reasons why
[1:52:38] and all that'll be accomplished by it if
[1:52:40] God said it yes sir you need to be
[1:52:43] obedient to that voice okay let's go
[1:52:45] back to the word and have uh Elias to
[1:52:48] continue to read
[1:52:50] and I bought the field oh look I bought
[1:52:54] it I I didn't consult anybody
[1:52:57] else I didn't ask my
[1:53:00] [Music]
[1:53:02] pastor I I I didn't go find me another
[1:53:05] Prophet somewhere who could help me I
[1:53:07] just did exactly what God Said to do he
[1:53:10] said he's going to come and offer you a
[1:53:12] piece of land I want you to buy it and
[1:53:14] so guess what I bought it go ahead and I
[1:53:18] bought the field of Hanam my uncle's son
[1:53:21] that was in anathoth and weighed him the
[1:53:24] money even 17 shekels of silver being
[1:53:27] very careful not to cheat him go ahead
[1:53:30] and I subscribed the evidence I
[1:53:32] subscribed the evidence I wrote out the
[1:53:36] transfer of deed wow want you to
[1:53:40] understand what's being said here I
[1:53:42] wrote out the transfer of deed and what
[1:53:46] else does he say he did Ellas and sealed
[1:53:48] it and sealed heed it what else and took
[1:53:53] Witnesses took Witnesses and weighed him
[1:53:57] the money in the balances so I have paid
[1:54:00] him his allotted price I have written
[1:54:03] out the transfer of deed and I have
[1:54:07] sealed it with a wax seal and a thread
[1:54:11] all right let's go on so I took the
[1:54:14] evidence of the purchase the evidence of
[1:54:16] the purchase is
[1:54:18] what the deed the transfer of deed and
[1:54:22] remember what he did he wrote it out and
[1:54:25] he sealed it with a wax seal and with a
[1:54:28] string that goes all the way around it
[1:54:30] so that if that string is broke even if
[1:54:34] the wax seal was in place if the string
[1:54:37] was broke then that title deed is no
[1:54:41] longer authentic it is no longer
[1:54:44] transferable it is no longer
[1:54:47] recognized okay now go so I took the
[1:54:50] evidence of the purchase both that which
[1:54:52] was sealed according to the law custom
[1:54:55] and that which was open so there is
[1:54:57] actually two copies one is sealed so
[1:55:01] that it cannot be open and another copy
[1:55:04] is available so that you can look over
[1:55:07] that and read I had some property
[1:55:09] transferred to me some time ago by by
[1:55:12] citizens of Germany and when they
[1:55:15] transferred the property to me it looked
[1:55:17] like something out of medieval times
[1:55:20] it was it was a scroll written uh rolled
[1:55:24] up and a wax seal and a band that went
[1:55:27] all the way around it and then a copy so
[1:55:30] that I could read what was contained I
[1:55:32] was told don't break that
[1:55:34] seal so Jeremiah is following the custom
[1:55:39] of his day he has evidence of the
[1:55:42] purchase that has been sealed he has
[1:55:45] evidence of the purchase that is
[1:55:47] unsealed he has followed the law and the
[1:55:50] custom read
[1:55:52] on and I gave the evidence of the
[1:55:55] purchase unto baruk the son of narah the
[1:55:59] son of Mah Mah in the sight of Hanam my
[1:56:03] uncle's son and in the presence of the
[1:56:05] witnesses and subscribed the book of the
[1:56:08] purchase before all the Jews that sat in
[1:56:11] the court of the prison this is a legal
[1:56:13] transaction with all kinds of witnesses
[1:56:15] do you get that read
[1:56:17] on and I charge baruk before them
[1:56:21] saying thus saith the Lord of hosts the
[1:56:24] god of Israel take these evidences take
[1:56:27] these
[1:56:28] evidences take this title deed the one
[1:56:32] that is sealed and the one that is
[1:56:35] opened go ahead this evidence of the
[1:56:38] purchase both which is sealed and this
[1:56:40] evidence which is open and put them in a
[1:56:42] earn vessel put them in a clay pot yes

[1:56:50] the clay vessels that the that the
[1:56:52] fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls were
[1:56:55] found in I've not only seen pictures but
[1:56:57] I've seen some of the very pots with my
[1:57:00] own eyes in the in the in the museum
[1:57:03] there in Israel uh where the remnants of
[1:57:08] the Dead Sea Scrolls are kept and
[1:57:11] they're still finding ancient Documents
[1:57:14] To This Day sealed
[1:57:17] readable after all of these years
[1:57:20] because they were
[1:57:22] deposited in clay
[1:57:26] vessels I'm just saying that slow just
[1:57:29] wondering if you'll get it where I'm
[1:57:32] going the
[1:57:34] evidences were to be placed in clay

[2:00:20] story are you with me all right let let
[2:00:23] me let me just show you this see if we
[2:00:25] can get it a little closer to you I'm
[2:00:27] trying to preserve my voice but in the
[2:00:30] message Revelation 5 number one
[2:00:33] 1961 if you can read it like I would
[2:00:36] read it
[2:00:40] Go Adam in the beginning was given by
[2:00:43] power no no was given power was given
[2:00:46] Power by God to have jurisdiction over
[2:00:49] all the earth now let that sink in just
[2:00:51] a moment you all know that don't you
[2:00:53] Adam was he he was he wasn't just a
[2:00:57] gardener he had Dominion
[2:01:00] did he spoke and the birds had to fly he
[2:01:04] called in the animals had to come right
[2:01:06] did you know Adam was given the nature
[2:01:09] of the animal and supernaturally the
[2:01:11] name was revealed he named the
[2:01:13] animals all he had to do was call them
[2:01:15] come on and they just lined up and Adam
[2:01:19] the Bible said and Adam gave them their
[2:01:21] name right powerful he had
[2:01:23] Dominion let me tell you what we've been
[2:01:26] taught in our day that when he needed to
[2:01:28] move a tree he didn't have to get a
[2:01:31] shovel the whole earth and everything in
[2:01:33] it was placed there by the spoken word
[2:01:35] and so Adam was given dominion over the
[2:01:38] garden and he was to rule it by what the
[2:01:42] spoken word so his nagging wife came
[2:01:45] along and she said
[2:01:47] Adam that tree is blocking my
[2:01:51] patio come
[2:01:55] on and you know what he didn't say well
[2:01:57] honey I'll I'll get to it I'll get to it
[2:02:01] I'll get around to it any of you ladies
[2:02:03] ever heard that Jenna you ever heard
[2:02:06] that when I get a chance I'll get it
[2:02:09] done don't worry just be patient no Adam
[2:02:12] didn't do that he didn't have to he had
[2:02:14] dominion over all
[2:02:16] creation he just spoke the word yeah yes
[2:02:20] somebody said how do you get such an
[2:02:21] idea like that what do you think Jesus
[2:02:23] was talking about prophetically in the
[2:02:25] New Testament when he said if you've got
[2:02:29] faith as a grain of mustard seed you
[2:02:32] will say to the sycamine tree be thou
[2:02:34] removed and cast into the sea and he
[2:02:37] said it will obey you that's right he
[2:02:39] was reflecting back to the Dominion that
[2:02:41] he had given Adam in the beginning and
[2:02:43] so when Adam needed to move a tree that
[2:02:45] was casting shade on the patio and his
[2:02:48] wife wouldn't leave him all he had to do
[2:02:49] was say be thou removed and it was gone
[2:02:51] if he spoke and the Animals came come on
[2:02:55] now so Adam in the beginning was given
[2:02:58] Power by God to have jurisdiction over
[2:03:01] all the Earth read on when God put Adam
[2:03:04] on Earth he gave him the jurisdiction
[2:03:06] over all nature all animals all life
[2:03:09] everywhere Adam was an amateur God don't
[2:03:12] let that throw you for a loop the Old
[2:03:16] Testament tells us the very same thing
[2:03:19] yes Jesus repeats it in the New
[2:03:22] Testament don't you all he F speaking to
[2:03:25] the Jews don't you like the scripture
[2:03:27] that that says we are we are all gods g
[2:03:29] o d small G it means a it means a a a
[2:03:34] administrator it means an administrator
[2:03:37] of deity serving under the headship of a
[2:03:41] higher deity that's what he's saying oh
[2:03:44] and you know that's what you are you may
[2:03:47] not be functioning in the full of it I
[2:03:49] may not be functioning in the fullness
[2:03:51] of it in this hour but it's the
[2:03:53] potential that we carry read
[2:03:57] on but Adam Our Father forfeited it to
[2:04:01] Satan now what did he forfeit to Satan
[2:04:03] the right to have dominion over the
[2:04:06] Earth read on Adam lost the rights of
[2:04:09] that book he lost the rights of that
[2:04:13] title
[2:04:17] deed he Lo lost the rights of the book
[2:04:20] of
[2:04:22] ownership the book that says Adam you
[2:04:25] have dominion over the Earth Adam lost
[2:04:28] the rights to that book you got to have
[2:04:31] the
[2:04:32] proof you can't just say I own it all I
[2:04:34] have authority over it all you got to be
[2:04:36] willing to show you got to have the
[2:04:38] proof you've got to have the evidence
[2:04:41] and Adam lost the right to the book in
[2:04:45] the Garden of Eden do you understand
[2:04:47] when he listened to his wife read on he
[2:04:50] forfeited it when he listened to his
[2:04:52] wife and she listened to Satan's reading
[2:04:55] reason reasoning in the said of the word
[2:04:58] of God all right read one more from the
[2:05:00] breach paragraph
[2:05:02] 103 and we're going to move on Adam lost
[2:05:05] his inheritance the earth now it passed
[2:05:09] from his hands to the one he sold out to
[2:05:12] Satan read that again Adam lost his
[2:05:16] inheritance the earth now it passed from
[2:05:19] his hand to the one he sold out to
[2:05:23] Satan read on he sold his faith in God
[2:05:28] to Satan's reasonings therefore his
[2:05:30] eternal life his rights to the Tree of
[2:05:33] Life listen his rights to the Earth
[2:05:36] belong to him and he forfeited every bit
[2:05:39] to the hands of Satan read on he passed
[2:05:42] it from his hand to Satan therefore now
[2:05:45] it has been it returned and has been
[2:05:48] polluted and the seed of Adam has
[2:05:50] destroyed the inheritance that Adam
[2:05:52] should have had that's the Earth that's
[2:05:55] right see the seed of Adam look at the
[2:05:58] earth look at the wildness of the earth
[2:06:01] we live in right now look at the
[2:06:03] insanity of people around us look at the
[2:06:06] pollution of this earth look what sin
[2:06:09] has done this was a promised event we
[2:06:12] knew that it would end up this way but
[2:06:14] let's just be rejoicing that this is not
[2:06:17] the end of the story
[2:06:20] so let's catch up God told Jeremiah to
[2:06:23] obey a very strange command he told him
[2:06:25] to buy a piece of land from his cousin
[2:06:28] while the Babylonians were marching into
[2:06:30] Israel taking Conquering the nation
[2:06:33] enslaving the people why buy land just
[2:06:38] before an enemy takes it over and cares
[2:06:40] less about who owned it or who recently
[2:06:43] sold it or purchased it what value would
[2:06:46] it be to buy land that was soon going to
[2:06:49] be owned On Demand by the enemy what
[2:06:54] kind of a cousin would seek to sell you
[2:06:57] such a piece of land isn't that a good
[2:07:00] question Spurgeon said about this
[2:07:02] reference he said now this was a strange
[2:07:05] purchase for a rational man to make
[2:07:08] Prudence could not justify it it was
[2:07:12] purchasing an estate which was utterly
[2:07:16] valueless while the en he marched toward
[2:07:19] the city Jeremiah legally purchased the
[2:07:24] parcel of land he signed a deed for the
[2:07:27] property sealing one and leaving One
[2:07:31] open available to be read and he hands
[2:07:35] it over to Barack which means Blessing
[2:07:38] by the way Benjamin Land was already
[2:07:42] under Babylonian control at the time so
[2:07:45] this parcel was already under the
[2:07:47] illegal jurisdiction of the
[2:07:50] Babylonians he sealed a copy of the deed
[2:07:54] handed it to baroo and told him keep it
[2:07:58] in a safe place since it would be a very
[2:08:01] long time before it would be retrieved
[2:08:04] again but it would be retrieved are you
[2:08:10] still with me Jeremiah 32
[2:08:13] 2425 read it for us Elias behold the
[2:08:17] mount behold
[2:08:19] the
[2:08:20] mounts these mounts are engines of
[2:08:25] shot they are something like a
[2:08:28] catapult that was used in the time of
[2:08:31] the
[2:08:32] calans the mounts had already been
[2:08:36] pulled in to the edges of this parcel of
[2:08:39] land when Jeremiah was told to buy it
[2:08:43] now read on and know what we're talking
[2:08:45] about behold the mounts behold the
[2:08:47] mounts they are come unto the city to
[2:08:50] take it and the city is given into the
[2:08:52] hand of the calans that fight against it
[2:08:55] because of the sword and of the famine
[2:08:58] and of the pestilence and what thou Hast
[2:09:00] spoken is come to pass and behold thou
[2:09:03] seest it read on and thou Hast said unto
[2:09:07] me oh Lord God buy Thee the field for
[2:09:10] money and take Witnesses for the city is
[2:09:13] given into the hands of the calans This
[2:09:16] is Jeremiah the prophet checking with
[2:09:20] God Lord are you
[2:09:23] sure the more I look at this The
[2:09:27] Stranger it
[2:09:28] looks is there any possibility I
[2:09:31] misunderstood your instruction he's
[2:09:34] having this conversation with god he
[2:09:36] said look God the engines of shot are
[2:09:38] already in place the enemy is right here
[2:09:42] so close I can smell his breath I can
[2:09:45] see them and their weapons marching up
[2:09:47] the hill with my naked eye and yet you
[2:09:50] told me to buy this piece of land the
[2:09:53] enemy is upon us and will certainly
[2:09:55] occupy this very parcel of ground now I
[2:09:58] want you to listen at what God said it's
[2:10:01] about to get really good here in just a
[2:10:03] minute Jeremiah 3226 through 31 read it
[2:10:07] Elias then came the word of the Lord
[2:10:09] unto Jeremiah I just told you what
[2:10:11] Jeremiah says to the Lord now the Lord
[2:10:14] is talking back to Jeremiah go ahead
[2:10:17] saying behold I am the Lord behold
[2:10:21] that's you got to read this is God
[2:10:22] talking behold behold I I am the Lord
[2:10:27] the God of All Flesh now wait a minute
[2:10:31] you know who's talking right now here's
[2:10:34] what he said he asked a question can you
[2:10:36] read that
[2:10:37] question is there anything too hard for
[2:10:40] me no no no not for me is there anything
[2:10:44] too hard for
[2:10:47] me is is there
[2:10:49] anything too hard for me no God says
[2:10:55] Jeremiah Don't You Know Who I Am don't
[2:10:59] you know I keep my word why are you
[2:11:02] questioning me so I told you to do it
[2:11:05] and you did it and now it's done why do
[2:11:07] you want to talk about it now don't you
[2:11:11] understand that I am the Lord the God of
[2:11:14] All Flesh is there anything Hallelujah
[2:11:19] hallelujah hallelujah is there anything
[2:11:23] too hard for
[2:11:27] me what's the
[2:11:29] answer
[2:11:31] no read
[2:11:33] on therefore thus sayith the Lord behold
[2:11:38] I will give this city unto the hand of
[2:11:40] the calans I'm going to give this city
[2:11:43] into the hand of the
[2:11:45] calans and into the hand of neb
[2:11:48] Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon and he
[2:11:50] shall take it read
[2:11:53] on and the calans that fight against the
[2:11:56] city shall come and set fire on this
[2:11:59] city oh now they're going to burn it
[2:12:02] down and burn it with the houses upon
[2:12:05] whose roof they have offered incense
[2:12:08] unto ball and poured out drink offerings
[2:12:12] unto other gods to provoke me to anger
[2:12:15] so first they're going to go up on the
[2:12:17] roofs
[2:12:19] and they're going to offer strange
[2:12:20] offerings to false gods they're going to
[2:12:23] defile every house of the
[2:12:28] Israelites can you
[2:12:30] imagine murdering a
[2:12:33] family tying them
[2:12:37] together on their knees in a living room
[2:12:41] poking one of the children's eyes out
[2:12:44] while they sit down at a table and eat
[2:12:47] the Shabbat meal
[2:12:48] right that the woman has just
[2:12:54] prepared what kind of an animal can do
[2:12:57] something like this it's not so very
[2:12:59] different than what was going on in
[2:13:01] Bible times we're just not used to the
[2:13:04] shock of such
[2:13:06] Madness they walked into a home and
[2:13:09] found a whole family bound
[2:13:13] murdered within 3 feet of the table
[2:13:17] where the terrorist then sat down and
[2:13:19] helped themselves to the meal that the
[2:13:22] mother had just finished preparing for
[2:13:25] Shabbat God said the calans are coming
[2:13:28] they're going to fight against this city
[2:13:30] they're going to go up on the roofs and
[2:13:32] burn incenses to their false gods
[2:13:35] they're going to pour out their drink
[2:13:36] offerings to other gods and then they're
[2:13:38] going to set the houses on fire and
[2:13:41] they're going to set the cities on fire
[2:13:44] and they're doing all of that to provoke
[2:13:46] me
[2:13:48] to anger is anybody reading that now
[2:13:51] read
[2:13:52] on for the children of Israel and the
[2:13:55] children of Judah have only done evil
[2:13:58] before me from their youth now God said
[2:14:00] this is why I'm going to allow
[2:14:04] it I gave them opportunity to possess
[2:14:08] the land of the heathens while not
[2:14:10] participating in their Pagan
[2:14:13] practices but what did my people do this
[2:14:16] is what the word of the Lord is saying
[2:14:17] what did my people do they started
[2:14:19] worshiping false
[2:14:21] gods they started trying to worship me
[2:14:24] in the way they had observe the others
[2:14:27] worshiping their false gods they learned
[2:14:30] the way of the
[2:14:34] heathens remember that's Jeremiah 10
[2:14:36] we're in Jeremiah 32 see they learned
[2:14:40] the way of the heathens they started
[2:14:42] trying to worship Jehovah in the way
[2:14:45] that bael was being worshiped and other
[2:14:47] gods and God said I'm not going to allow
[2:14:49] that to happen what I'm going to do is
[2:14:51] I'm going to provoke the
[2:14:54] calans I am sending my people into a
[2:14:58] 70-year Exile in Babylon because they
[2:15:01] wouldn't obey my
[2:15:03] voice I told them not to send their
[2:15:06] daughters down come on to lay with
[2:15:10] strange
[2:15:12] men I told them they had to monitor
[2:15:16] their their relationships
[2:15:18] with other nations because I had chosen
[2:15:21] them to be my own come on I told them I
[2:15:25] told them to be careful that they
[2:15:27] maintain the farming practices that God
[2:15:30] had instructed them to maintain and that
[2:15:32] they continue to dress in the manner
[2:15:35] that I had called my people to
[2:15:38] dress remember in that day it was you
[2:15:41] you don't mix
[2:15:43] wool and flax and other other threads
[2:15:47] together today the requirement is a
[2:15:49] little bit different but God still means
[2:15:51] what he says and says what he means I'm
[2:15:54] not trying to be offensive I'm trying to
[2:15:56] tell you if God says I want my people to
[2:15:59] be separate amen and I want everybody to
[2:16:02] be able to look at them from afar and
[2:16:04] know their
[2:16:05] mind I want them to be able to pass
[2:16:08] their
[2:16:09] farms and notice that their crops are
[2:16:12] not fashioned like the crops of other
[2:16:14] nations for I have told my people don't
[2:16:17] you put two seed in the same row that's
[2:16:20] all the other nations will plant corn
[2:16:23] and beans and tomatoes together but God
[2:16:25] said I want my people on to plant their
[2:16:29] crops one seed to a
[2:16:32] row
[2:16:34] why is there any real value to that the
[2:16:37] only value that we know of is God wanted
[2:16:41] the Heathen to pass by the Farms of the
[2:16:44] Israelites and
[2:16:46] no come on here's a farm it belongs to
[2:16:50] the ones who serve the unknown God yeah
[2:16:52] the god of Abraham the god of Isaac the
[2:16:56] god of no name is what they called him
[2:16:58] at times the god of I am he wanted
[2:17:01] everybody to know I've got a people and
[2:17:04] they're not living like the rest they're
[2:17:06] not behaving like the rest they're not
[2:17:08] conducting business like the rest when
[2:17:10] they give you their word on on you can
[2:17:14] take it to the bank come on they don't
[2:17:16] cheat they don't don't
[2:17:18] lie they don't twist the
[2:17:22] truth they don't steal from God they
[2:17:26] don't steal from one another this is
[2:17:28] what God Said but my people wouldn't
[2:17:30] listen and they started doing all the
[2:17:33] things they saw other people doing they
[2:17:35] watched it on the television until it
[2:17:37] became a part of their own culture hello
[2:17:41] they started fooling around and wasting
[2:17:43] their time with
[2:17:45] silliness instead of focusing the their
[2:17:47] lives on me and so I have
[2:17:52] allowed we're not living in the Old
[2:17:54] Testament anymore God said I have a new
[2:17:56] covenant with my people so don't you say
[2:17:59] for one minute what the church world
[2:18:02] says that this is happened to Israel
[2:18:04] because they rejected Christ I want you
[2:18:07] to know this that has happened to the
[2:18:09] Jewish people has not befallen them
[2:18:12] because they rejected Christ they
[2:18:14] rejected Christ according to the New
[2:18:16] Testament it's my fault that's right so
[2:18:19] I should have been the one to pay
[2:18:21] because the New Testament says Their
[2:18:23] Eyes Were blinded so that the Gentiles
[2:18:26] could see the light come on now somebody
[2:18:29] said well don't you remember they
[2:18:31] screamed out let his blood be upon us
[2:18:34] and so they had to pay the price they
[2:18:36] did they paid the price they finished
[2:18:39] their price and now they're under a New
[2:18:42] Covenant God said A Renewed Covenant
[2:18:45] amen so we're talking about old Old
[2:18:47] Testament behaving now and God said they
[2:18:50] they brought this on themselves for the
[2:18:53] children of Israel and the children of
[2:18:54] Judah have only done evil before me from
[2:18:56] their youth for the children of Israel
[2:18:58] have only provoked me to anger with the
[2:19:00] work of their hands sayeth the Lord and
[2:19:02] that is verse uh 30 one more verse for
[2:19:06] this city hath been to me as a
[2:19:08] provocation of mine anger and of my Fury
[2:19:12] from the day that they built it even
[2:19:14] unto this day that I should remove it
[2:19:16] from before my face you don't need to
[2:19:18] lose sight of what God Said to Jeremiah
[2:19:21] by The
[2:19:22] Land by the land I don't care what it
[2:19:25] looks like by the land I don't care what
[2:19:27] your family says about you by the land
[2:19:30] because I am still in control now go to
[2:19:34] verse 36- 40 start reading it would you
[2:19:38] and now therefore thus sayith the Lord
[2:19:40] the god of Israel concerning the city
[2:19:42] whereof ye say it shall be delivered
[2:19:45] into the hand of the king of Babylon By
[2:19:47] The Sword and by the famine and by the
[2:19:50] pestilence now you're fixing to get real

[2:20:10] you worry I'm going to bring them home

[2:20:15] stop me that's what God's telling us
[2:20:18] behold I will gather them out of all

[2:22:14] enemies of the children of Israel will

[2:22:20] mind God said I am going to so
[2:22:22] ultimately destroy their enemies that no

[2:23:28] drove you this land will always be your
[2:23:31] inheritance and not just this parcel
[2:23:33] that you hold the deed to Jeremiah but
[2:23:35] all the land that I have promised to
[2:23:38] your father Abraham are you with me the
[2:23:41] enemy's got to be dealt with first the
[2:23:43] land may not be worth much when the
[2:23:45] enemy gets a hold of it and who knows
[2:23:47] what they will do on that land and to
[2:23:50] that
[2:23:51] land I'm just comparing this I'm not
[2:23:54] saying I'm just comparing this to a
[2:23:56] modern situation did you know in
[2:23:59] 2006 when Israel withdrew from the Gaza
[2:24:03] I was in
[2:24:04] Israel and I saw what was happening in
[2:24:08] the
[2:24:09] land they they marched out
[2:24:13] of Immaculate Beautiful s homes fully
[2:24:19] furnished many of them didn't even take
[2:24:21] their bed frames with them when they
[2:24:23] left the government had promised them
[2:24:26] something unfortunately it wasn't
[2:24:29] exactly what they had been promised but
[2:24:32] they
[2:24:33] moved Israeli police Israeli soldiers
[2:24:38] had to drag some of their own people out
[2:24:41] of
[2:24:43] Gaza why because somebody read the book
[2:24:48] right they call them radicals and
[2:24:50] zealots and
[2:24:52] settlers they look down on them but
[2:24:54] somebody read the book somebody said how
[2:24:57] can our government Force us to leave the
[2:25:00] land that God has given us by an
[2:25:02] Everlasting
[2:25:05] Covenant I saw the interview of both
[2:25:07] soldiers and policemen who said it was
[2:25:11] the hardest thing we have ever done in
[2:25:13] our lives some walked off the job after
[2:25:16] 25 years of experience forfeiting their
[2:25:19] retirement there were Christian
[2:25:21] organizations in this nation that helped
[2:25:24] fund policemen who lost their
[2:25:27] pensions because they refused to drag
[2:25:30] Jewish settlers out of the
[2:25:32] Gaza in 2006 as this withdrawal was
[2:25:36] taking place there were unbelievable
[2:25:39] farms in
[2:25:41] Gaza under the occupation and I don't
[2:25:44] believe Israel was occupying the land
[2:25:45] that God gave them but under what is
[2:25:48] called the occupation Israel had turned
[2:25:51] that desert Wasteland of the Gaza into
[2:25:53] an oasis comparable to the Jordan Valley
[2:25:57] saw it with my own eyes I know what I'm
[2:25:59] talking about the
[2:26:03] carrots the carrots that they grew in
[2:26:06] Gaza I
[2:26:08] ate they were known all over the world
[2:26:12] to be the sweetest
[2:26:15] carrots scientist botanists were amazed
[2:26:18] how can sweet carrots come out of
[2:26:23] sand no
[2:26:26] nutrients how do you know
[2:26:28] how because the word of the Lord was I
[2:26:31] will cause this desert to Blossom like a
[2:26:34] rose Israel is one of the number one
[2:26:38] exporters of flowers and fruit in the
[2:26:41] entire world it is the number one
[2:26:43] exporter in the Middle East flowers
[2:26:47] roses did you know that in one year
[2:26:49] alone Israel exported more tulips than
[2:26:53] the nation of Holland in three
[2:26:57] years how is that possible because God
[2:27:00] blessed those
[2:27:02] settlers they built beautiful
[2:27:05] homes air conditioned some of them homes
[2:27:08] which is unheard of in that part of the
[2:27:10] world these green houses stretched as
[2:27:15] far as the eye could see where these
[2:27:17] unbelievable carrots were being grown
[2:27:22] synagogues as beautiful as what was
[2:27:25] being built in
[2:27:27] Jerusalem were built in the Gaza
[2:27:30] apartment
[2:27:31] complexes modern
[2:27:33] conveniences and the government of
[2:27:35] Israel decides that they have to
[2:27:37] withdraw because of the pressure of our
[2:27:40] nation and other nations of the world
[2:27:42] the only way to say to the world we want
[2:27:44] peace is to move out and leave
[2:27:46] everything behind can you imagine
[2:27:48] leaving the home that you had built with
[2:27:50] your own hands and money and not sure if
[2:27:52] you were even going to be paid for it
[2:27:54] but you had no choice but to leave and
[2:27:57] to leave quickly the withdrawal took
[2:28:00] place over a period of about three days
[2:28:03] tens of thousands of Jewish people left
[2:28:05] their homes properties synagogues
[2:28:08] [Music]
[2:28:10] malls there was malls in the northern
[2:28:12] part of GSA City this side of GSA City
[2:28:15] toward the toward the Jewish town of
[2:28:18] zot was a shopping
[2:28:21] ball that looked like something out
[2:28:24] of
[2:28:28] Dubai and in less than three
[2:28:32] weeks they had demolished the
[2:28:35] homes they had destroyed the fields they
[2:28:38] poisoned the
[2:28:42] crops I'm not just talking off the top
[2:28:44] of my head we have the proof the
[2:28:47] evidence is here they poisoned the
[2:28:50] fields and the carrots shriveled up in
[2:28:52] the fields under the effect of poison
[2:28:55] because they decided we would rather
[2:28:58] starve than to eat a Jewish carrot who's
[2:29:01] ever heard of a Jewish
[2:29:07] carrot is your carrot a Caucasian carrot
[2:29:10] because you grew it is yours an
[2:29:12] African-American carrot sister because
[2:29:14] you grew
[2:29:15] it merits don't know religion or
[2:29:18] ethnicity come on they feed hungry
[2:29:20] children anybody with me yes sir they
[2:29:23] feed hungry children they desecrated
[2:29:26] Jewish
[2:29:28] Graves they destroyed their synagogues
[2:29:31] they were told by their own imans why
[2:29:33] don't we turn these in we've been doing
[2:29:35] it for hundreds of years we've been
[2:29:38] turning Jewish places of worship into
[2:29:41] Islamic shrines for years we did it on
[2:29:44] the Temple Mount why don't we do it here
[2:29:46] in the Gaza but the people were so wild
[2:29:50] they refused to remodel the synagogues
[2:29:52] and they burned them and they destroyed
[2:29:54] them and in just a few weeks time what
[2:29:57] had been settlements and neighborhoods
[2:30:00] and Villages for people to live in Free
[2:30:03] Housing eat free food they didn't labor
[2:30:06] for and they destroyed every bit of it
[2:30:09] because of
[2:30:11] hatred and anger and
[2:30:14] wildness so please excuse me if I'm a
[2:30:18] little callous to the
[2:30:23] fact that trucks went in this week with
[2:30:26] no
[2:30:29] inspection the first round of trucks
[2:30:32] that took Aid into the GSA strip went in
[2:30:35] with no no no inspection because no one
[2:30:37] could decide on the Egyptian side who
[2:30:39] was qualified to inspect it doesn't take
[2:30:42] a genius to look for Rockets among the
[2:30:45] potatoes
[2:30:48] something seriously wrong I'm bringing
[2:30:51] this to your attention again because I
[2:30:53] want you to know that the war that's
[2:30:55] going on now is is so much more than
[2:30:58] what it appears to be with the natural
[2:31:01] eye this is a spiritual conflict that's
[2:31:03] been going on for years and the only
[2:31:05] solution is not war I'm not anyway
[2:31:08] saying that war is the solution God is
[2:31:11] the solution and the best thing that
[2:31:13] Israel could do would be just to return
[2:31:16] to the God of their Bible
[2:31:18] yes somebody said I want them all to
[2:31:20] know Jesus I just want them to know
[2:31:22] Jehovah for now I just want them to
[2:31:25] serve the god of the Bible with
[2:31:27] everything that is within them because
[2:31:29] they've got a
[2:31:31] promise they've got a promise they're
[2:31:34] going to get the land back are you with
[2:31:37] me I've not changed my mind the enemy
[2:31:39] will be dead with I saw the enemy coming
[2:31:42] and I already had a plan Jeremiah I
[2:31:45] always have a plan be prepared to hurry
[2:31:47] up and wait but I've got a plan lasted
[2:31:50] 70 years and when we read now here's
[2:31:53] what we're going to move into the last
[2:31:55] part of this for the for today when we
[2:31:58] read in Revelation 5 verse
[2:32:02] one and I saw in the right hand of him
[2:32:05] that sat on the throne a book written
[2:32:07] within and on the backside seal with
[2:32:09] Seven Seals let me read that for you in
[2:32:11] the complete Jewish Bible next next I
[2:32:14] saw in the right hand of the woman
[2:32:16] sitting on the throne a scroll with
[2:32:18] writing on both sides and sealed with
[2:32:22] Seven Seals that's what we're going to
[2:32:23] talk about next
[2:32:24] week when we read those verses we wonder
[2:32:29] if God was not using the symbolism of
[2:32:34] Jeremiah to bring something very
[2:32:37] precious into the newer
[2:32:39] Testament you see Revelation is a book
[2:32:42] of symbols do you do you believe that we
[2:32:44] can look elsewhere in the word word to
[2:32:46] get an idea of what the symbols
[2:32:48] represent but the truth is we
[2:32:51] Gentiles who always need
[2:32:54] signs who quite easily look over the
[2:32:59] voice we needed a
[2:33:02] prophet I don't want to offend
[2:33:05] anybody but we needed a prophet to help
[2:33:08] us discern the symbols of the Book of
[2:33:11] Revelation if you believe that say amen
[2:33:13] and God did not leave us without a
[2:33:15] witness
[2:33:16] he sent a word a sure word to help us
[2:33:20] understand the symbols of the book of
[2:33:22] the Revelation and when those seals were
[2:33:25] opened we didn't have to guess about
[2:33:27] what what each symbol represented we
[2:33:29] didn't have to guess what the White
[2:33:31] Horse was we didn't have to guess what
[2:33:33] the scale in his hand we didn't have to
[2:33:35] guess about the red because God gave a
[2:33:38] great biblical
[2:33:41] interpretation of what every one of
[2:33:43] those symbols represented if you believe
[2:33:45] that say Amen amen before the enemy
[2:33:47] Satan ever came in and tempted Eve the
[2:33:50] garden God knew exactly what would
[2:33:52] happen there do you believe it stay with
[2:33:55] me he looked across time in a manner
[2:33:57] that only he has the ability to do and
[2:33:59] he saw Eve being seduced and Adam taking
[2:34:02] on this Disobedience look at this verse
[2:34:05] in
[2:34:06] Timothy read it for me Elias 1 Timothy
[2:34:09] 21:14 brother and Adam was not deceived
[2:34:12] but the woman being deceived was in the
[2:34:15] transgression dude to this Disobedience
[2:34:17] God would cast Mankind from the garden
[2:34:20] just as he drove Israel out of the land
[2:34:24] into all nations I want you to compare
[2:34:27] two verses of scripture for just a
[2:34:28] moment Genesis 3:24 read that for me so
[2:34:32] he drove out the man and I know you're
[2:34:34] tired let me just say I know you're
[2:34:35] tired I just need to come to a close
[2:34:37] here in a moment thank you go ahead so
[2:34:40] he drove out the man and he placed at
[2:34:43] the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims
[2:34:45] and a flaming sword which turned every
[2:34:47] way to keep the way of the Tree of Life
[2:34:50] does anybody remember anything about
[2:34:52] those Cherry beams does anybody remember
[2:34:55] that the Bible said they had eyes within
[2:34:58] and
[2:34:59] without interesting isn't it we'll talk
[2:35:02] about that next
[2:35:04] week that word drove out of the garden
[2:35:06] it literally is the word for
[2:35:08] divorce God divorced them and drove them
[2:35:13] out of the
[2:35:14] garden compare that to Jeremiah 32:27
[2:35:18] read it for
[2:35:20] me behold I will gather them out of all
[2:35:23] countries whether I have driven them in
[2:35:25] mine anger and in my Fury and in my
[2:35:28] great wrath I will bring them again unto
[2:35:31] this place and I will cause them to
[2:35:33] dwell safely you see here God's driving
[2:35:35] them out and here God's driving them in
[2:35:39] remember what we said about the sword
[2:35:41] the same sword that that guarded the way
[2:35:43] to keep them out is now driving them
[2:35:45] back in in you see the connection does
[2:35:47] anybody see the connection is that a
[2:35:49] stretch or can you see it he drove man
[2:35:51] out of the garden just as he drove
[2:35:53] Israel out of the land but after Israel
[2:35:55] was driven out in the into the hands of
[2:35:57] the enemy God promised to gather them
[2:35:59] from where he drove them where back to
[2:36:03] the land again back to the Garden again
[2:36:05] back to himself again and he said they
[2:36:08] will dwell safely in the land ultimately
[2:36:12] for that to be accomplished the enemy of
[2:36:14] their souls would have to be dealt with
[2:36:16] with do you believe that John 12:31 I
[2:36:19] need some
[2:36:21] help John 12 31:32 read it now now is
[2:36:26] the Judgment of this world now shall the
[2:36:29] prince of this world be cast
[2:36:32] out and I if I be lifted up if I be
[2:36:35] lifted up from the earth will draw all
[2:36:39] men unto
[2:36:41] me this he
[2:36:44] said
[2:36:46] uh
[2:36:49] 33 is it not there this he said
[2:36:52] signifying what death he should die
[2:36:56] Jesus was not referring to our need to
[2:36:58] worship him when he said he must be
[2:37:00] lifted up he referred to what manner of
[2:37:02] death he would have by being lifted up
[2:37:04] on the cross do you follow that this is
[2:37:06] a beautiful parallel with Jeremiah 32
[2:37:09] before the enemy got a hold in your life
[2:37:12] listen God wrote a title deed
[2:37:18] Hallelujah he already had a plan for
[2:37:21] Redemption before the foundation of the
[2:37:23] world the lamb was slain to take away
[2:37:25] the sins of those who would possess the
[2:37:27] Earth ignoring God's plan for our lives
[2:37:30] we followed our own plan and we lived
[2:37:33] how we wanted to live but it never shook
[2:37:37] God God wasn't shaken when Israel
[2:37:40] rejected him and God wasn't shaken when
[2:37:43] you and I chose our own way he always
[2:37:46] had a plan it never shook him from his
[2:37:49] original intentions concerning us and
[2:37:52] even though we went about cursing and
[2:37:54] blaspheming full of unbelief and reving
[2:37:57] in the attributes of sin God was neither
[2:37:59] rushed nor discouraged he had an
[2:38:02] appointed time Galatians 4 veres 3-5
[2:38:07] read them quickly we got to go even so
[2:38:11] we when we were children were in bondage
[2:38:13] under the elements of the world but when
[2:38:17] but when the fullness of the time was
[2:38:19] come God sent forth his son made of a
[2:38:22] woman made under the law to redeem them
[2:38:27] that were under the law that we that we
[2:38:30] might receive the adoption of sons when
[2:38:33] is Israel going to have full possession
[2:38:34] of the land in another fullness of times
[2:38:37] juncture when the times fill up again
[2:38:40] yeah when Messiah comes again when
[2:38:43] everything is in place again and that's
[2:38:46] what we're beginning to see now is an
[2:38:48] unbelievable realignment taking place in
[2:38:51] the nations of the world to fill up the
[2:38:54] days of the Gentiles so that the mercies
[2:38:56] of God can return to the Jews if you
[2:38:59] understand what I'm saying say amen God
[2:39:01] already had a plan he already had a
[2:39:03] purpose he already had a promise look at
[2:39:06] Titus 1:2 in the
[2:39:08] Amplified resting in the Hope read it
[2:39:12] resting in the hope of eternal life life
[2:39:15] which the ever truthful God who cannot
[2:39:18] deceive promised before the world or the
[2:39:21] ages of time began he
[2:39:24] chose
[2:39:27] first he chose
[2:39:31] first we were able to choose him because
[2:39:34] in eternity passed he had chosen us as a
[2:39:39] part of his inheritance somebody said
[2:39:41] that smacks of Calvinism let's see if it
[2:39:43] smacks of scripture read Ephesians 1 3-6
[2:39:47] do it quickly the pressure is on you
[2:39:49] brother blessed be the God and father of
[2:39:51] our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us
[2:39:54] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[2:39:56] places in Christ he's called us to the
[2:39:59] land according as he hath chosen Us in
[2:40:02] him
[2:40:03] whoa according as he hath chosen chosen
[2:40:09] Us in
[2:40:14] him the night we got saved the night you
[2:40:18] you accepted the pastor's invitation the
[2:40:21] night you came down and shook the
[2:40:22] preacher's hand is that what the word
[2:40:24] says somebody tell me what the Bible
[2:40:28] said before the
[2:40:32] foundation of the world that we should
[2:40:36] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[2:40:38] before him in love having having
[2:40:41] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[2:40:44] the children by Jesus Christ Christ to
[2:40:46] himself according to the good pleasures
[2:40:48] of his will to the praise to the praise
[2:40:52] of the glory of his grace wherein he
[2:40:55] hath made us he hath made
[2:41:00] us what's the rest accepted in the
[2:41:03] Beloved
[2:41:05] accepted in the Beloved it's not God
[2:41:09] who's trying to make you feel like
[2:41:11] you're not being accepted by Christ
[2:41:13] that's the work of the enemy
[2:41:16] he made you accepted his blood on your
[2:41:19] life cries out you are accepted in him
[2:41:22] one more 1 Peter 1
[2:41:26] 18-22 for as much as you know that ye
[2:41:29] were not redeemed with corruptible
[2:41:31] things as silver and gold from your vain
[2:41:34] conversations received by Traditions
[2:41:36] from your
[2:41:37] fathers but with the precious blood of
[2:41:39] Christ has of a lamb without blemish oh
[2:41:42] my the precious blood of
[2:41:44] Christ
[2:41:46] as of a lamb without blemish and without
[2:41:49] spot who verily was for ordained before
[2:41:52] the foundation of the world but was
[2:41:55] manifest in these last times for you
[2:41:59] before the foundation of the world God
[2:42:01] already had a plan the sun was already
[2:42:05] on his
[2:42:08] mind he was not an eternal son there's
[2:42:11] no such thing as Eternal sunship God
[2:42:14] Alone is Eternal but the word became
[2:42:17] flesh in the body of the son
[2:42:21] manifested manifested in these last
[2:42:24] times for you read on who by him do
[2:42:28] believe in God that raised him up from
[2:42:31] the dead and gave him glory that your
[2:42:34] Faith and Hope might be in God seeing ye
[2:42:38] have purified your souls and obeying the
[2:42:41] truth through the spirits unto unfeigned
[2:42:44] love of the Brethren see that ye love
[2:42:47] one another with a pure heart fervently
[2:42:50] this scripture tells us why and how
[2:42:54] important it is to love one another
[2:42:57] without
[2:42:58] prejudice because it is a reflection of
[2:43:00] the love that he loved us with one more
[2:43:03] verse and I'm just stopping with no
[2:43:05] punchline can't make it today Revelation
[2:43:10] 138 and all that dwell upon the Earth
[2:43:13] shall worship Him whose names are not
[2:43:15] written in the Book of Life of the lamb
[2:43:17] slain from the foundation of the world
[2:43:20] that worship is not the lamb put that
[2:43:22] back please that worship is the
[2:43:25] Antichrist if you look at Revelation 13
[2:43:27] you put it in the right context and he
[2:43:30] said and all that dwell upon the Earth
[2:43:32] shall do what they shall worship him but
[2:43:35] there is a group that will never worship
[2:43:36] that Antichrist system somebody said
[2:43:39] well how do we know who who are they
[2:43:41] those whose names are not written in the
[2:43:44] book of the life of the the lamb slain
[2:43:46] from the foundation of the world I just
[2:43:48] missed that let's go back and catch the
[2:43:50] context I missed that I caught it
[2:43:53] so yes I caught it and I'm trying to
[2:43:56] correct it uh open Revelation 13 for me
[2:43:59] somebody I'm so sorry I picked the wrong
[2:44:02] the wrong
[2:44:04] place Revelation 137 let's go back one
[2:44:10] more let's go back let's get it right
[2:44:13] and there was given unto him mouth
[2:44:16] speaking great things and blasphemies
[2:44:19] and power was given unto him to continue
[2:44:22] 40 and two months and he opened his
[2:44:25] mouth in blasphemy against God to
[2:44:27] blaspheme his name and his Tabernacle
[2:44:30] and them that dwell in in heaven and it
[2:44:33] was given unto him to make war with the
[2:44:36] Saints and to overcome them and power
[2:44:39] was given him over all kindreds and
[2:44:41] tongues and Nations and all that dwell
[2:44:44] upon on the Earth shall worship Him
[2:44:47] whose names are not written in the Book
[2:44:51] of Life of the lamb slain from the
[2:44:54] foundation of the world if your name is
[2:44:57] on that book you will never worship that
[2:45:03] beast that's the context if your name is
[2:45:07] in that book from the foundation of the
[2:45:10] world not from the night you joined the
[2:45:14] church
[2:45:15] you chose him because he had chosen you
[2:45:18] isn't that what the word tells us and so
[2:45:21] your name wasn't written down we've sung
[2:45:23] all our life a new name written down in
[2:45:25] glory about the night we got saved but
[2:45:28] the reality of the word says that he
[2:45:30] knew from before the foundation of the
[2:45:33] world those who would choose him and
[2:45:35] those who would not choose him and those
[2:45:38] whose name is written in the book of the
[2:45:40] life of the lamb slain from the
[2:45:43] foundation of the world will never B bow
[2:45:45] to the Antichrist system and they will
[2:45:47] never yield to his
[2:45:49] influence I don't know if you're aware
[2:45:51] of that Antichrist Spirit but the New
[2:45:53] Testament tells us it's already in the
[2:45:55] earth and it's already trying to
[2:45:57] influence us
[2:45:59] politically spiritually in the natural
[2:46:02] let the musicians come and it's up to
[2:46:05] you and I to make sure that we recognize
[2:46:08] anything that twist the truth of God's
[2:46:11] word to pull us back to the traditions
[2:46:14] of man amen it doesn't seem like a very
[2:46:18] good
[2:46:19] decision to buy land in a war
[2:46:25] zone Jeremiah questioned his own
[2:46:28] obedience but he didn't
[2:46:31] anyway because God said one of these
[2:46:34] days when they bring them home when I
[2:46:37] bring them home I want you to be able to
[2:46:40] hold up that title deed or someone in
[2:46:42] your place will hold hold up that title
[2:46:46] deed and say this was the doings of An
[2:46:49] Almighty God who has settled his people
[2:46:52] back into the land of promise we too
[2:46:56] have a land of promise as a bride of
[2:46:59] Jesus Christ these great Treasures of
[2:47:01] heavenly things have been invested and
[2:47:04] stored in Earth and vessels our bodies
[2:47:07] if the same spirit that raised Jesus
[2:47:09] from the dead quickens your mortal body
[2:47:12] you'll also live in Resurrection Life do
[2:47:15] you believe that let's stand forgive me
[2:47:18] for not being able to bring this home I
[2:47:20] will on Tuesday night I thought I had
[2:47:23] enough time to get it in and I didn't
[2:47:26] but may God help us to be ever
[2:47:30] sensitive to the reality of the hour
[2:47:32] that we live in it's not just over a
[2:47:35] piece of real estate that the war is
[2:47:37] Raging it's over the spiritual Promises
[2:47:39] of God promises to the Gentiles Promises
[2:47:43] to the Jews and you and I have to be
[2:47:46] those who recognize God when he speaks
[2:47:49] and we have to be ready to move I want
[2:47:52] to love what he
[2:47:54] loves I want to hate what he hates does
[2:47:57] that sound radical for 2023 I think it
[2:48:00] does a bit I I think the church world
[2:48:03] looks at that as a very radical
[2:48:05] statement to make but it's really what
[2:48:07] what lovers of the Christ will do I want
[2:48:10] to love what Christ loves I want to be
[2:48:13] for what he is for
[2:48:15] and I want my life to stand against what
[2:48:17] he is against may God help us all father
[2:48:20] we we come to you today I I stand here
[2:48:24] pretty frail in my in my emotion because
[2:48:27] I I I sort of failed to bring this to
[2:48:30] the place where I desired to bring it I
[2:48:33] know you'll grant us another opportunity
[2:48:36] to do that I I pray Lord that those who
[2:48:39] are here will will yet somehow still be
[2:48:43] challenged to know that sometimes your
[2:48:46] your
[2:48:47] leadings your instructions may may feel
[2:48:53] foolish we may not in the moment be able
[2:48:55] to look and see the full
[2:48:58] value of what we're told to
[2:49:01] do we may be misunderstood by family
[2:49:05] members we may be misunderstood by by
[2:49:09] church folks just softly
[2:49:12] something we we may be misunder stood by
[2:49:15] by members of our own
[2:49:18] household by those we work
[2:49:21] with by those we fellowship
[2:49:24] with but your little bride is going to
[2:49:28] hear and
[2:49:30] discern and obey your voice in this
[2:49:33] hour because we like the
[2:49:36] Jews we now hold a title deed yes it is
[2:49:41] no longer in the hands of
[2:49:43] Satan Revelation 5 tells us that there
[2:49:47] was a
[2:49:49] lamb who was found
[2:49:52] worthy to open up the title deed of
[2:49:56] Heaven and
[2:49:57] Earth and when John looked in and saw
[2:49:59] his
[2:50:00] name he could not
[2:50:03] contain his
[2:50:06] Joy two translations of that verse tell
[2:50:09] us that that all creation heard I
[2:50:13] John
[2:50:15] emphasis being he shouted with such a
[2:50:18] shout cried with such a
[2:50:20] cry that even those things within the
[2:50:23] surface of the Earth heard his
[2:50:27] voice as he exalted the
[2:50:30] lamb there are many of us in this house
[2:50:32] today who have had the same
[2:50:36] privilege to look into that
[2:50:39] book now opened and in the hands of the
[2:50:43] Lamb find our
[2:50:46] name know that it was written there
[2:50:49] before the foundation of the world and
[2:50:52] sometimes father we just cannot contain
[2:50:55] our
[2:50:57] joy you knew me before by my mother had
[2:51:01] any thought of
[2:51:04] me and you loved me when I was yet
[2:51:11] unformed and you made a plan
[2:51:15] to show yourself to me and in
[2:51:19] me as your word
[2:51:22] declares and I am forever
[2:51:25] grateful my soul wants to sing my spirit
[2:51:29] wants to sing my body wants to sing your
[2:51:34] praise churchianity is not enough for
[2:51:38] your
[2:51:38] bride freedom is what we
[2:51:41] desire Liberty is What We crave
[2:51:45] for where the spirit of the Lord
[2:51:48] is there is
[2:51:50] Liberty there is
[2:51:52] freedom your word says we are remade and
[2:51:57] reshaped Hallelujah he whom the sun sets
[2:52:01] free has been
[2:52:04] reformed no longer a
[2:52:07] slave no longer a
[2:52:10] hostage no longer in
[2:52:13] Exile you you stepped away from your own
[2:52:16] people blinding their
[2:52:18] eyes that you might take from among the
[2:52:22] Gentiles a people for your name's sake
[2:52:26] and I'm one of those if you witness that
[2:52:29] you're one of those why don't you thank
[2:52:31] him right now Lord I Thank you that I'm
[2:52:33] one of the I'm one of those a stranger
[2:52:36] an alien from the common wealth of
[2:52:39] Israel standing outside your Everlasting
[2:52:43] Covenant and yet you blinded the eyes of
[2:52:46] your
[2:52:47] chosen that you might take from among
[2:52:50] the nations of people who would glorify
[2:52:53] you who would recognize their name in
[2:52:57] the title
[2:53:00] deed restoring to us what Adam
[2:53:06] lost dominion over our own
[2:53:11] emotions dominion over our own thoughts
[2:53:15] dominion over our own
[2:53:18] bodies and even sometimes we have to
[2:53:21] stand and take authority for our
[2:53:24] families because Satan is ever nipping
[2:53:27] at the heels of those we love but today
[2:53:30] we thank you we thank you for the plan
[2:53:34] we thank you for the reading of the
[2:53:37] will we thank you for opening up the
[2:53:41] book we thank you that it's no longer
[2:53:43] seal
[2:53:46] but it's an open
[2:53:49] book written within and
[2:53:53] without the Cherry beams were chosen to
[2:53:56] guard it for ever so
[2:53:59] long and they had the the
[2:54:03] ability to look upon it in such an
[2:54:06] unusual
[2:54:08] way until the hour that you would let
[2:54:10] your bride
[2:54:11] see oh Lord I'm so thankful
[2:54:17] you let the world say that we follow a
[2:54:19] man but Lord we're following your
[2:54:23] word we let men make
[2:54:27] mistakes we let prophets be
[2:54:30] human but we are following your
[2:54:33] word strengthen
[2:54:37] us encourage us Jesus Infuse us with
[2:54:42] your life yes
[2:54:47] Deliver Us from the memory of our
[2:54:50] past when Satan chains us with
[2:54:54] condemnation may we may we press out of
[2:54:58] it and
[2:55:01] realize that we had a piece of the
[2:55:05] land before we could ever occupy
[2:55:09] it we were already in your
[2:55:12] will we were already end the title
