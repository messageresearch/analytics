Description:
Pastor Steven L. Shelley delivers a thought-provoking message about finding the authentic Jesus beyond religious traditions and Christmas celebrations. This message challenges common perceptions about Jesus, emphasizing the importance of His death, burial, and resurrection over His birth. Pastor Shelley discusses why focusing solely on baby Jesus or Christmas traditions misses the true significance of Christ, and explains how faith in Jesus's shed blood - not religious practices or traditions - is what truly matters. An eye-opening perspective on why the world needs more than just a 'Christmas spirit' or religious customs to find the real Jesus.
