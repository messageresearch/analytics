most is the little fellow when he was being when we were welcoming he was beaming he was beaming from ear to ear and we are so thankful to have them I've known that family a very long time and I was I I wasn't able to be at the office a couple days this week because of my ankle and I I was re organizing pictures and I kept coming across pictures of Andrew and uh the time that he met uh there in in Saskatoon when you when you met the famous violinist Maurice scar he just called me recently and I haven't had a chance to get back to him but uh anyway we're glad so glad sister Dorothy it's so good

evangelism is we just have babies they've all got to get here all those seed all those predestinated seed have got to get here before you get out of here that's right and so God's bringing them and it seems like they're coming pretty quick these days and I got to meet Isaiah River and he is a doll and he the first picture I saw I thought he looked exactly like Anna Christine and his big sister Gwyn and I still think after seeing him in person yesterday he does however I did get five or six pictures this morning from Brother Austin Hodges who were sent to him from his mother and I had to humbly confess that I could see a tad a bit every dad wants to be there and it'll come it will come it doesn't matter the first few hours or days they change so fast and uh so I want to I want to well this was oldfashioned Sunday we just didn't tell you to wear your bonnets but I guess you heard in the singing that Benjamin has been to a Gaither concert this week and so we were walking down memory lane for all of those of you who that's not your cup of tea well we'll try to give you another flavor when you're here the next time but it it's it's mine I have to be honest uh uh that I wouldn't take nothing for a journey now some of you aren't old enough to have had a journey but you'll get one and when you do you'll be able to look back and say through the through the trials through the through the those moments of hopelessness when you felt like you you were just didn't want to live and he stepped in and brought you a little closer to him we have so much to be thankful for and I appreciate my kids uh taking me I wasn't physically able to go but I went anyway and I made up my mind I wasn't going to be discouraged about it I wasn't going to say oh I wish wished I could get around better I just went was still on the knee scooter I've I'm on Just DE cane and I can walk without it today but I wanted to protect the tendon as much as possible but I went and we were the youngest people there that's always a good feeling 2,000 people and most all of them in their 70s and uh but you know for a Methodist Church hosting this big group that come in from everywhere it was kind of a lively crowd and if you if you've never been to one it sure was sweet to see those senior citizens trying to figure out how to turn their their flashlights on and when the when the when this real song with a real special meaning would come on they would take their their cameras out and their phones out and they would wave it back and forth and it it was real pretty you turn around and and it looks real good and you see you see you know stumbling around and and one man in front of me said I can't get mine on can you get mine on I want to wave mine his wife said yes honey I'll do that but to see Bill Gaither 88 years old still traveling and still talking to people and come he come down off the off the stage at the end and he just talked about what it feels like to be nearer there to be closer Home than you've ever been before and to and and really to have no regrets to know you've given your life you've wasted yourself for him and not for the world you've given everything that you have for the kingdom and it it was a it was a real inspiration and I'm thankful that to Benjamin and Jenna uh made it possible for us to go it was real sweet of them uh today is Luke Jernigan's birthday birthday

like that and the enemy say but you know what it didn't steal my joy oh no I'm going to praise him and I want you to do the same no matter what's going on in your life you give him praise he brings us through is that right are you ready to help me Abigail has already sent a message thank you for your birthday greetings and you are most welcome I hope to see you all again one day Romans chapter 8 we also have greetings coming in from many places around the world of great group of Believers in Kenya are joining us now and uh Philippines and I don't know where all it's hard to tell sometime unless they unless they write it in someone from Massachusetts a pillar of fire Tabernacle somewhere in looks like South America also Norway uh Indiana South Africa there many places thank you thank you for for being with us Romans chapter 8 and verse 11 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken make alive that's the word in Greek make alive resurrect your mortal Body by his spirit that dwelleth in you amen that's Resurrection life and that is anastasis life and that anastasis life is not just resurrecting from the from the actual dead being in a grave of physical natural grave and getting up but it is a continual this is what I love it is a continual quickening it is a continual unction it's a continual Resurrection and when they were trying to take it from the Greek and express it in English it was said that it is a reproducible a duplicatable resurrection aren't you glad that his resurrection is a duplicatable resurrection it is a reproducible resurrection and it's in us I I noticed when brother Cade was singing that he said I'm the New Testament church now you've been listening to the message because many times a prophet would tell us make that personal I'm a New Testament Church rising up because the church is not the four walls the church is you you're the house that the Lord is dwelling in would would you would you remain standing for just one more verse if you're able and that is Isaiah 60 we were on this Tuesday night and uh let let me hit this again and this this is from the Amplified and here it says arise from the depression and prostration you know what that means depression is to be pressed down and prostration is to be flat knocked down flat rise from being knocked down and flat in which circumstances have have kept you it it's it's normal that hardship may cause us to waver a bit it may anoint our doubt and we may have to bring that under control but it is not normal for a Spirit-filled believer to want to stay there if you find yourself pressed down and you want to stay there you need more of that reproducible Resurrection come on you need more of that quickening life and and let me tell you something brother sister there's more of it for us now I know some are offended I know you're standing uh but I know some are offended when you hear like a song this morning uh there's a new and a fresh anointing because they've got this idea there's nothing new nothing new nothing new nothing new what you don't understand is the same anointing it's not a brand new anointing it's moving in you in a fresh way amen and and you know it will it'll it'll do that sometimes it makes us creative that anointing makes us creative it causes us to to be artistic or or to be better organized and we've been anointed for that and then other times it it might anoint us to to to write uh words from the Lord from his heart on paper and and go back and read them and be blessed by them later it might cause a songwriter to write a song it might cause someone to come to church with an extra uh extra Hallelujah in his step it's all the same logos it's all the same Christ but he can he can engage with you and you can engage with him in a in a fresh way and it feels brand new oh hallelujah how many of you need a brand new touch oh I hear ly wolf when I say that Lord you know I need a brand new touch my strength from yesterday is gone and if you Lord will give me another touch I will find strength to carry on we need it yes we need it so arise from the depression and prostration in which circumstances have kept you rise to a hello New Life shine look at somebody shine tell them shine be radiant with the glory of the Lord you know sometimes you see Holiness people out and they look so mean they got the bun but they but they're mean looking mean looking God's people should be the smiling happiest people on the face of the Earth not because they don't have any problem but because they got somebody carrying them shine be radiant with the glory of the Lord and you can just imagine how they look at me with whiskers as the apostolic church has rejected the new Old Testament order of those kinds of things you know and so they really look at you like who are you you're just a bum but you know it doesn't matter does it we're going to shine anyway be radiant with the glory of the Lord for your light him he has come and the glory of the Lord anybody glad for it father we thank you today for your precious word it's life to us not just once a week not just twice a week but every time we engage your word every time we hear the prophet's tape every time we read it for ourself every time we hear an anointed man of God speaking it forth in unction we are lifted up your word is more than bread to us it's also meat to us and when we when we when we needed milk it has been milk to us us and we want to thank you for that it's a healing bomb it it's oil on a dry parched heart your word is everything that we need and you are the manifestation of that word and you are calling us to be the present uh manifestation of your word and it seems like a bigger job than we are capable of doing but you have promised it and you are the one who is bringing it to pass and we want to thank you for helping us today as we look to your word in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the Saints said amen you may be seated but stay with me if you can and help us to get through this numbers if you'll go there honey chapter 19 beginning in verse one and let's catch four verses there and the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying this is the ordinance uh did I lose my place this is the ordinance of the law which the Lord hath commanded saying Speak unto the children children of Israel that they bring thee a red heer without spot where in is no blemish and upon which never came a yoke I I want to emphasize that phrase and upon which never came a yoke we have for the past three services we have talked about that yoke Isaiah tells us that because of the anointing the yoke is say it out destroyed not broken because broken you know you can fix anything with crazy glue and Gorilla Glue and and if if one touch of that anointing just breaks that yoke I tell you the devil's already on the way to the church house to try to glue it back together and put it on your shoulder he wants to be your Taskmaster he can't change your Eternal destination but Satan wants you to do his bidding he can't change your your relationship with God he can hinder your fellowship but he can't change your relationship but what he'd like to do is take a Believer and yoke them up with all kinds of different uh uh you know things weights hindrances and in doing so they become a a spreader of negativity instead of spreader of Faith come on they're children of God they've had a born again experience but they've gotten cold in their experience and and Jesus said well I would that you were either hot or cold but the lukewarm spew out of my mouth so you don't want to be in that lukewarm place you don't want to be in a cold place you want to stay as fiery hot for the king as you possibly can amen and when we get lukewarm or cold and we get in the negative Zone and faith is not our vocabulary anymore we're still children of God we're just going through something and it becomes a yoke on our shoulder and we need that anointing I'm going to preach to you with me we need that manifested presence of the Lord amen the word alone can't get it all done oh that's what the Bible said don't get that look on your face you know this Bible even a message book can become a dead letter if you adopt it as a Creed it it's it's it's the anointing it's the Living Word that delivers and sets free and that Bible and this message that we have we're so thankful and grateful for it but it is to us a a a written record or now A Spoken record of God's word I'm not going to debate with you this morning about whether it is equal to or not but I will tell you it's a dangerous thing to get get your eyes off Jesus if you do that God will let you see the humanity of a man and it will cause you to spin so my best advice to you has always been keep your eyes on Jesus and off of other people he'll never fail you people will always they will they will they don't mean to they won't intend to but but in relationships we will fail one another but he will never fail us and let me say my absolute is that word of God when I hear something under the inspiration I have to take that and find it I've got to find a place to lock that into the Bible and then it all becomes the absolute it's all the absolute then when it locks into that word dob Tales he said like going to the Chinese laundry it all fits in then the whole thing all of that becomes the absolute nothing can stand alone apart from the word of God no Pastor no Prophet no book no tape no recording come on not even our heroes nothing can stand alone it must stand uh firm on that word of God and he is the one who taught me that really it's the truth he is so this is under the law and it is the offering of the red heer now you know there's been a lot about that lately a lot about that uh they have built a practice altar that's all it was I know that you've read all kinds of different things but it was a practice Altar and I've already been sent from Israel three videos of of of a crowd watching the the the priesthood practicing learn learning how to to go up and down the ramp and how to conduct themselves now there was a lot of talk that there would be a a a red heer offering tomorrow evening as Passover begins in Israel it is possible but highly unlikely and there are reasons for that there is no Temple and there is this thought that the the new ashes of the red heer would have to be mixed with some of the ashes of the last red heer and so that leaves a big gap and not sure how that will be handled and no one among those learned men is ready as far as we know to publicly declare how that will be handled in the absence of having they they believe believe that there that these ashes have perhaps been preserved and that they are probably hidden away some people have uh uh felt like even archaeologists have felt like that it was would be in the area of Jeremiah's cave and uh that they would find the ashes there in an earn vessel there are all kinds of things and you and I as New Testament Believers we can't get so caught up in that that it becomes a conspiracy theory we have Christ oh we have the one who came to fulfill it all let me tell you the red heer his name is Lord Jesus Christ and he's bore it all but it's interesting to us as Believers because the prophet tells us that the temple will be rebuilt he tells us that it's right in the message of the hour and we don't know if it is a third Temple that he seems to be referring to or if in fact it's the millennial Temple that he's referring to but we do believe I believe that it certainly will take place it is exciting though that they have as I showed you pictures quite a while ago uh of some real specimens and I'm pleased to report that they have remained pure this is the most unique thing it's not the first time that they have found uh a pure red heers a family of pure red heers we're not going to stay there long so don't worry but normally after a period of time uh it's like the first gray hair on a man's beard I don't advise you to pull it out but I advise you to get ready because it's just the first fruits of what is to come I see sisters sometime got a hold of one and they're put don't you know they multiply you earn them you ought to be thankful for them don't turn them all kinds of colors let it let it be a testimony that God has kept you he's kept you and he's going to keep us all the way these red heers this family it did in fact come from the United States and they have been in Israel now for some time and so far not one white hair has has grown into place so they are still available if needed the temple Institute remember brother bisc had the temple Institute in and you all became familiar through videos and streaming some years ago uh about what was going on in the temple Institute the rabbi came to to the church at brother biscos and gave a testimony of what they were doing and recreating all of the different implements and so forth so what has been in the media is a practice altar it's exciting to us because it tells us that what we're feeling this this this strange I hear sister green you know I'm sorry but I hear things in songs and I hear sister green singing her song uh and there's a strange excitement in the air Hallelujah and we feel it as Believers that we are we're on the precipice of of something we we've got the message and it's life to us but it's me it's really getting manifesting time and we're going to be tested on that and we're going to have to come forth with the proof that we have been with Jesus stay with me and so I think it's exciting that even the Jews are sensing an excitement in the middle of war in the middle of of rockets coming for the first time in history directly from Iran and yet there is an excitement that they are closer to the coming of the Messiah than they have ever been before that excites me in 1979 when I was in Israel for the first time there were little Chambers I noticed the last time I was there they're they're kind of sealed now because there was an earthquake that took place one one time my mother and I landed in Israel for a trip at and a snowstorm uh followed an earthquake an earthquake came and a snowstorm freak snowstorm came that afternoon or the next day the earthquake caused some of that original ramp that leads up to the Temple Mount to to crumble down and because of that they sealed remember it exposed an ancient gate it exposed the ancient mcrai gate and what was interesting to us is we were getting ready for camp meeting or maybe just had had camp meeting and the theme was was uh going in I don't remember the right wording anybody going into new doors through through ancient Gates through ancient Gates into new doors kind of was along the line of the song We were singing today and so in 79 when I was there there were Chambers on the women's side and and uh Stone windows with with just a little protection bar to keep birds from going in and there were women there who were dressed in sackcloth and who were wailing back and forth and you you had to be in just the right place on the menide to see it but it was quite a sight these women on their their heads covered and they're bowing down and they're rocking back and forth and they're wailing a a moan for sorrowful sound and I remember this 11-year-old boy saying to the guide are they grieving the loss of a loved one and he smiled and he said oh no they are mourning and weeping and wailing and calling for their Messiah to come now if in 1979 there were already people who were wailing and mourning and begging and seriously among the Jewish people people Desiring that the Messiah would come there must be even more desperation coming now so this is an exciting time because that last Gentile is about to come in we know that and then the mercies of God returns to his Covenant with Israel now that's why we care that's why we even mention any of it that's why we even talk about Passover or any other of God's holy Feast we do it because it points us to the Fulfillment of all of those things his name is the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah we need to know what we stand on we need to know what the foundation is for what we believe are you with me so they're looking under the direction of the Lord to to find a red heer that is without spot without a white hair wherein there is no blemish and and this is a kicker and upon which never came yoke so this has got to be a young enough uh red heer that it has never been in servitude it has never been directed by man we might say virgin we might say pure we might say unadulterated one that has never been under the control of a master never had that that heavy burden laid on his shoulder and told which direction to go and so when the sacrifice was to be made it had to be made with a specimen that had never had a yoke upon its shoulder and ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest that he may bring her forth without the camp now where does Hebrews tell us that Jesus suffered and died without the camp there is the reason why he couldn't die in the city he had to die on the outside of the city and many people believe that it was on in fact the Mount of Olives and a ramp and they have found the remnants of that ramp was built from the Temple Mount all the way across the valley uh to the to the top of the Mount of Olives they believe that is where the the burnt uh offering of the red heer took place and that it was directly parallel with the holy of holies now why is the holy of holies significant because that's where the blood was applied and uh how often how often one time a year by the high priest who could go in behind the veil only the high priest but on this day it's very like ly here Jesus is dying parallel to the holy of holies and when brother brandom is preaching this he said why they could look out the window anybody remember him saying it they could look out the window and see him hanging there on the cross and yet refused his sacrifice are you with me and he said they got out what needle and thread and what did they start to do to sew up the veil to mend the veil now that gets me a little hot around the collar you see I had to loosen my tie when you think about religious men here God makes a way he opens up the door and preachers sea pardon me religious men get in the way the prophet of the Old Testament predicted he prophesied there'll come a day they won't go in and they won't let others go in they'll stand in the way there's a motivation in some places for keeping people away from the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost there is is a a a a an intention and an ambition sometime that lies behind uh someone trying to keep somebody from experiencing the reality of a personal baptism of the Holy Ghost because when they have that new birth it opens their eyes to a lot of things and the spirit begins to move and Mama's in the prayer closet and Daddy's in the on the porch in prayer and people begin to move and get excited and God begins to talk and he begins to reveal and sometimes he even exposes sin so we must not stand in the way and we must not adopt Creeds and dogmas in our day that will legislate uh men and women from having a real Liberty and freedom to yield to what was promised to us in in the Bible right they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover they shall speak with new tongues as the spirit gives utterance we know that's how it comes that and if they if they drink any deadly thing any deadly poison it won't harm them that sounds like a New Testament Church before the Holy Ghost was poured out God was already building in embryonics the church that he was going to inaugurate on the day of Pentecost aren't you glad he's got it all figured out ahead of time and so we're thankful we don't ever want to be a people that discourage somebody from encountering Jesus for themselves you must be born again you've got to have that Holy Ghost experience give it her unto Eleazar the priest that he may bring her forth without the camp and one shall slay her before his face and Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger and sprinkle of of her blood directly before the Tabernacle of the congregation there's the seven again all through the book completion God's Divine Perfection through the book over and over again it's Jesus to us it's Jesus who stood in the midst of the seven golden lampstands it was Jesus who is the Lamb that had seven eyes it was Jesus come on it's there it's speaking to us even in the Book of Numbers now Brother brandham Talks to us I hope you won't mind me taking a few minutes here Brother brandom Talks to us about yolks that the enemy likes to put on our neck and and and in the in in the in the infamous Church age book uh brother brandham or someone said the Yoke of hierarchy he likes to put that yoke of hierarchy on people now if you don't know what that means it's the same thing as a nician spirit it's causing everybody to to find someone else to look up to and and this is the only one my pastor is the only one that can get in touch with God I hope that's not correct I I hope there are many pastors and many men of God and this this priesthood of the Roman system has somehow filtered its way down even into protestantism and there is such a hierarchy of things and they call it putting things in order but sometimes it's been L more like murder we don't want to murder we want to let the Holy Ghost have his way we want some order but we don't want anybody looking to men we get help from Men of God we get leader ship for men of God but there's a time that you need more than a text or a phone call with your preacher you've got to be able to get a hold of God for yourself so this denominational church say they they Bishops they you know General prors they're overseers they like to put committees in place uh uh they like to have all this so everybody knows their place and everybody's connected you know that can really be a yoke of hierarchy on on the little the bride of Christ we don't want that we don't want to carry that we want to break free of that in 1957 brother brandham is preaching on on the book of Corinthians and he says we don't want that yoke of pharaoh to be on our neck no yolks I want somebody to declare with me no yolks no y I'm not wearing the devil's Yol I'm not wearing Pharaoh's Yol I'm not wearing yolks of hierarchy or yolks of depression or yolks of jealousy or yolks of anything else that would hinder or prostrate me in such a way that I can't arise and shine but what do we do with a scripture like this in types and symbols when in order for a sacrifice to be made a specimen had to be found in which a yoke had never been laid on his should her shoulder excuse me if I say his a heer is most definitely a him I mean a her oh I don't know if that was just age or or prazone I'm not sure which it was but anyway I've got it right now her on her how do you do that in in a in a in a type when you start looking at us who have this promise that the Yoke will be destroyed because of the anointing how do we apply that when we look at other prophecies in Isaiah that we've been reading about the captive Daughter of Zion and we're told that the the prophet of the Lord says to her get up arise shake off the dust loose thyself not an evangelist loose thyself if we Are Spiritual Israel and here we've been studying in Isaiah that a little bride was all down broken blooded laying in her in her shame refusing to change her her circumstances are setting the Yoke that was around her shoulder was not even locked the answer had already come to set her free but she's still wallowing there in in her in her hurt and her her pain of what she's been through and the prophet comes along under the word of the Lord he said get up from there Rise Up Shake thyself shake off the dust loose the bands and so if we look at that and we look at who we are as spiritual Israel is there anyone in this room who can say with with with total honesty that you have never been under the influence or control of something in your life never been moved by jealousy never been been been controlled by religion never been manipulated by Family never had a habit that was hindering you more than it was helping you I don't think there's anybody I I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost at 7 years old I've given him my whole life but I can assure you that any chance any opportunity that Satan has had to to come in and and oh so uh slithery seductive and slimy and he he has taken full advantage to slip a yoke on my shoulder many many many times so what hope do I have for the anointing to sent me free and what hope do I have to really be identified with Christ if I have already yielded myself to the influence of of a spirit or to another man how can I ever be purified how can I ever be changed by the anointing how many of you know there's an answer let me ask you this question how many of you have gone through several versions of church to get to where you are today various names over the door yeah names of blasphemy usually because to declare to the community that God lives here and then bring people into a dead religion is a lie come on so don't call it Tabernacle of Jesus Christ if Jesus hadn't been there in 40 years Church of God is there has he been there lately is he showing up Assembly of God uh whatever name you put on it let let it be a true reflection of what's going on on the inside it really should be otherwise it becomes names of blasphemy how many of you how many of you been in one other church let me ask you this question especially to you locals how many of you this is only church you've been a part of let me see your hand that would have to be some of you few of you only church you've ever really been a part of God bless you how many of you came from from another one other version of church let me see your hand and how many of you came by uh maybe through two two versions three versions four versions five versions six versions a dozen versions oh what a journey you my friend have worn many yolks on your shoulder how can you ever ever be completely free how could you ever be a a a Living Sacrifice to the Lord having been through so many uh touched by man do you understand right no longer virgin no longer pure because in in each version we go through man leaves his impression on us come on and and we keep journeying on and this isn't against preachers or churches or denominate we're not we're not singling anybody out but we've all been touched come on how many of you were ever baptized in titles wow how many of you were sprinkled somebody said sprinkled I get stirred that stirs me up uh but you know like coming from the Amish they're poured some of that those are poured they're not sprinkled they get water poured on them that didn't were you baptized sister Martha was it poured on your head well I've been told that's better than sprinkling it's another step on the journey Hallelujah but you're not dead till you've been buried I immersion is biblical baptism and and you don't baptize babies anybody ought to know better than to than to do something like that we we're but we were in that and that's what we and people get so excited and they buy Christening gowns and and I don't know if you've seen any of those reals or not but boy some of those uh uh Russian Orthodox and some of those groups they get violent in their in their sprinklings they just sometimes take some of them actually will kind of immerse them in a little font kind of Di them down in a font you seen any of that and there and once is not enough so they dunk them several times all of it man's interpretations I once preached in a church where people were told you have to go down under the water three times one for the father one for the son one for the Holy Ghost and so what did Sincere people do they stood in line to be baptized three times in the name of titles ignoring acts 238 Church can mess with you honey but you were God's even in that he already oh he already had you in his mind he was already drawing you to him some of us came straight some of us came straight from Pentecost to the message some had to go through all kinds of different ways to get to where they are today but you bless God in all of it don't let bitterness ever grip your heart for your journey you were there because you had to be there you had to be there many people I know could have never come right out of sin into into the full truth they had to be sprinkled a little here and sprinkled a little there and sprinkle so how is it that any of us can be really pure virgins because he's coming back just like Moses gave the instruction this red heer has to be without blemish and never wearing a Yol the Bible said he's coming back for a church without spot without wrinkle without blemish a pure Church a virgin Church an unadulterated Church how could any of us qualify some of you didn't even think to get your name off the book oh my is there any hope for you you you you brother I tell you if God would have called me out I'd have said strike my name come on get my name off the book I don't want to be recorded I don't want to be read thank you for blessing me and helping me thank you for everything you've did now take my name off the book give me my letter what is that anyway a letter it's a yoke of hierarchy you can't join the Church of Jesus Christ I don't care how many letters you carry I don't care how many times you've got the right hand of Fellowship let me tell you they don't only have a right hand of Fellowship they've got a right boot of Fellowship some of you have got them both they welcomed you in and they kicked you out don't worry but how are we ever going to stand before him pure unadulterated virgin which means untouched never knowing the a man never knowing how are we ever going to get there don't you worry don't you worry even those of you who if you were to go over there to some church your name is you know name 1,9 on a roll a roster and that's why in churches like that they'll say the membership is 5,000 there's 5,000 on the roll and you look at the board or the bulletin or whatever on a Wednesday night and there's 50 because some of these people hadn't been to church your name is being counted some of you that didn't get it off in churches that you haven't been in in 20 and 30 years there's not even enough to have a Sunday night service a Wednesday night service but you're on the roll over there and they're still bragging about a thousand people or more come on that's the way the church packing pews and it has become a circus folks and you know it come on how are we ever going to be that bride that he's looking for I want you to know he's handled it he's handled it let me share with you a quotation from from God's provided approach to Divine Fellowship what a title are you still with me I know I'm a little slower sitting we want to think now on the 19th Chapter of of numbers God this is paragraph 13 God told Moses and Aaron go take a red heer now the symbol of red many times is a bad color or danger but red can also mean atonement you believe that go get a red heer all red not a spot on her she represent ented this is Brother brandham preaching she represented of course Christ just look in another document honey and see if you can find it and this heer must never have a yoke upon its neck if it was ever yolked it's condemned it must not be yolked up with the world has anybody ever been yolked up with the world here he said that's the way the church is today Christ when he came he never yolked himself with the world he stayed with God and he was not yolked up with the world the church that worships God today it's not yolked by the world it's yolked with Christ read those three words after look what the blood does look what the blood does he said then we find that this heer had to be killed in the evening time in the presence of all of the church Eleazar was to catch her blood upon his fingers and walk toward the doors of the Tabernacle and sprinkle the blood seven times or otherwise put seven Stripes over the door of the congregation then the heer was to be burnt hoofs horns hide flesh and all and in this burning of the hepher it was to then be mixed with hup he said I I believe the better word for it pronounced this way hup scarlet and Cedar Wood there was a process a there was Waters of separation and there was a process that was necessary but but once that that blood once that red heer had spilled that red blood it made atonement under that law it made atonement for The Sinner and for the worshipper do you follow that in a message God's provided way to provoke uh to uh fellowship and it's uh it's in another another city he said bring me a red heer upon which was never a Yol not yolked up with anything else bring her and let her be brought before Eleazar the high priest in the congregation and let them kill her and let Eleazar take the blood upon the fingers and sprinkle Stripes over the door of the congregation seven times then said let them burn her body with her hoofs and her horns and all that she is and then take scarlet and hisop and Cedarwood and throw it into the sacrifice and burn this together my what a recipe and then they was to mix it with water and put it in a clean place and it was to be Waters of Separation to sep separate The Sinner the Christian from her sins his sins to bring him into oh hallelujah how many of you are glad for the Waters of Separation it is separated you from your sin it has divorced you from your past it has healed you and restored you so that you stand before him pure today even though you wore a Yol on your shoulder even though you bent low beneath the burden of man's religion somewhere along the way even though sin was weighing you down and addiction was weighing you down thanks be to God Amen The Living Sacrifice the Lamb of God came to fulfill everything necessary to separate you from your past you are not that old man you used to be we know this we know this but sometimes we have to be reminded don't we now what happened if a Sojourner or a stranger of either a children of Israel had sinned and done wrong they came to the outer courts first and I want you to notice the mixing of the sacrifice beautifully now the first there was put in Cedar that's Cedar Wood scarlet and isip those three elements they're used in the Bible many times to speak uh it speaks of a covenant now you you take a three cornered piece of glass and shine it to a light a sun it'll produce seven different colors a rainbow color a prism right if you put the three uh and against the sun it'll reflect the rainbow and a rainbow stands for a covenant so he's typing every little piece of this out now I studied this sometime ago on what does scarlet mean in the bible Scarlet was Ram's wool that had been dyed in blood knowing that something died to color the animal anim a different color something had to die to change the color of the Beast how many of you know something had to die to cover Adam and Eve in the garden something had to die to cover you and I he said the ram was a gray color Grizzle which is a hypocrite color it's neither black or white oh my the Modern Trend of painting everything gray and here brother random says it's a a hypocrite color but once died in the red anybody here knows anything about science knows that you can take anything red and look at it through red and it looks white therefore when your sins be as red as Crimson they're black first then you pour that red blood on them and God looks at them through the blood of his son you become WI never a yoke never a yoke never a yoke has been on your shoulder Untouched by men come on that's what the blood can do that's what justification does that's what full Redemption does red through red looks white red looking at Red turns white God looking at the sinner that's confessed he is a sinner and has accepted God's provided way of approach God sees him why a snow a heer where there's never been a Yol a lamb where there's never been a blemish come on look at all the typology we go all the way through the scripture God sees him white as snow there you're looking red through red he can't look through a Creed you may be in good standing with your church but how is your relationship with him on he cannot look through a denomination he cannot look through something else it must be the blood and what else blood alone and the blood alone he said oh how I remember the old Salvation Army song oh precious is that flow say it with me that makes me white as snow no other f i know nothing but the blood of Jesus you who were sexually impure BC before Christ when you receive a virgin word when you receive the unadulterated pure blood of Jesus Christ he sets you free from that Mark against your life now I just looked it up uh to see and the question was asked on a science Forum why do we see a white object when we're looking at a red object through red glass and here's the answer it might mean something to some of you nerds he said now let's say your red filter is perfect it only allows red light and blocks everything else so anything that's actually red will send light to your eyes and anything that isn't actually red won't so red will appear white and everything else will look black I don't know that that means any more to me than than it did before I read it but now you've got a scientific explanation for what brother brandham knew him a long long time ago he'd already come across the information and he said if you're looking at a red item through a red piece of glass it's not going to look red it's a little fascinating isn't it it's going to look white so we are being justified and we are being restored and we are being made virgin it's too quiet did did you know the blood can do that did you know the blood can do that Birmingham let me give them Birmingham scriptural signs we're moving but remember the bride will be called out separated and different filled Holy Ghost born washed in the blood she'll abstain from everything that's filthy around her husband she is a chased virgin pure how by the word even you were sprinkled even you that wore titles even you that were immoral hello even you that had more lovers than you can count that precious word that precious blood has not only covered your sin but it has atoned and it has Justified and it has redeemed us back to the original thoughts that God had about us in the beginning Hallelujah so even though there have been many times in our life that a yoke was laid on our shoulder and we were temporarily driven many of us had a pig pin experience he found us in the pig pin like you found the prodigal there he came to himself how many of you are glad for the day that you came to yourself yeah preacher I remember but I've been way back again since then I I've gone back into all kinds of things since then I want you to know this the same blood the same blood that took your yolk off the first time right the same blood cries out on your behalf right so don't trouble me after the service by telling me you don't know what I've done I don't need to know sometimes I don't even want to know the one who knows the most about you loves you the most and all he said is claim my blood make my word make up your mind to arise out of the depression and the prostration that your circumstances have kept you in arise and shine for the glory of the Lord has risen upon thee God still has an appointment in your life he doesn't see it no he doesn't see it he chooses to see you through the blood does he know it sure he knows but it's not what he's looking at you know we're not completely free from something until we can look at the offender and not feel the offense I want to tell you something I'm not quite there in some few few few few circumstances I have forgiven and I have moved on but I can't tell you that sometimes when I see someone that I don't remember I have to make and you do too in that situation we have to make a conscious decision the blood the blood the blood the blood the blood the blood the blood the blood the blood when he looks when we look we see from memory as well as the moment but when he looks she is a chased virgin pure by the word it's just 1:00 folks the word in her the word in her the word in her the blood in her oh yes are the same as a man and his wife become one in Union so does the real genuine Church of God God when he becomes in Christ the Bible is punctuated with an amen every promise don't make any difference what the denomination says the soul that's in The Believer punctuates it because it is the word in him what about those who were molested both naturally and spiritually what about those who carry the scars of of religious molestation of church abuse what about those touched by men's ideas leading them away from the word and sometimes doing it sincerely because they couldn't see in that point in their life the fullness of the truth so why hold it against them why not just let it go even those who have dealt with that kind of violation because one of the things that happens to you when you come out of mess is you feel so violated why didn't you tell me that God is one why were you trying to give me more than one person when the Bible tells us he's one three offices three demonstrations and more but one God why did you tell why didn't you tell me that that clean living matters and why didn't you tell and you go through all of that you got to let that go you've got to let that go let me tell you something once you put the Yoke of his love his blood his word once you wear that let me tell you what Jesus said in Matthew 11:28-30 come unto me I've had so many people through the years say I feel like a fool for all the stuff I swallowed I feel like a fool for every lie that I believed in church or or a young woman I believed every lie that boy was telling me I believed he loved me come on I really believed I was going to be the one but he took me and he used me and he left me I believe what he had to say and many times people get that they carry that and it it becomes a burden to them I want you to know Jesus takes care of that he said come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest brother that's more than eight hours of sleep it's a peace it it's a bubble of peace that passes all understanding and and you say oh my by the grace of God he brought me through all that today I'm a new creature today I'm I'm not wearing the Yoke of hierarch today I'm not wearing Pharaoh's y Yol today I'm not wearing the Yol of denominationalism today I'm not wearing the Yoke of addiction and if you are he's offering you his and his yoke not only replaces the old yoke but the old yoke is destroyed because of the anointing because of the impact of the logos because of what the pillar of fire accomplishes in the life of the believer the old yoke is destroyed and you are made pure by his yoke his yoke takes away the stain of the molestation the stain of being joined to something other than Christ thinking that you're doing God a service this yoke take my yoke take my yoke upon you this is the one who fulfilled the sacrifice of the red heer this is one who came brother brandham says and I don't know if we we'll get to it but he says he had to come by a virgin birth because he was a building a virgin church he was building a virgin bride he couldn't come by a sex act he said Jesus couldn't have come by a SE sex sex act it had to be divine because he was building a Divine people he was calling out a Divine seed a holy people an undefiled people and yet we all know as we admitted a few moments ago we all know we've been defiled we all know we've been touched we all know we've been B burdened down and we have gone through I don't want to sound uh disrespectful but through hell and high water come on you you can handle a little of that can't you cuz that's where you've been and if I turned you loose you might say where worse than that so let me help you but thanks be to God you come through I come through I came through I came through I came through I came through I overcame now tomorrow night when the sun is going down it begins on the on our calendar the the Feast of of of unleavened bread and tomorrow night specifically is the night of the Passover so tomorrow all day is called a Passover and the Seder would traditionally be had tomorrow night the first night of of the week of UNL bread it doesn't matter when you do it matters that you take this opportunity to remember that the death angel once came very close to your house anybody listening to me I know I'm long- winded I've been told by by by all my life I've been told that so I I'm not offended when you say it unless Zach makes a joke or something it might hurt my feelings a little little sensitive sometimes most of the time I can handle it and always tell him I got lots to say come on you don't have to say am man you didn't have to like what I say but you could have said amen you have lost to say I don't always like it but you got lost to say he told me when he called me you open your mouth mouth I'll feel it I haven't ever closed my mouth he hasn't ever stopped feeling it I hope he uses me more I hope I can be used more for the kingdom I I realize uh you know even when you feel sorry for yourself if you let God talk to you you realize I got more to give I got something else to do for the king Hallelujah so I need not wallow around in the in the of of of my failure or my mistake or my slackness or what I didn't do people say I've just I've just wasted so much time don't you know who you serve you serve a redeemer of time oh my God all your wasted time he can redeem that when you take his yoke on you he actually takes you back to a place untouched pure undefiled when the hardest things for my mother to understand when she came to the Lord was how it could really be so how could a God who remembers everything who knows everything omniscient all knowledge How could a god like that forget my sin because he chooses to see you through the filter of the blood that he created to redeem you oh he knew you before you were born he knew you before you were even in your mother's womb he knew you and he knew then that you'd have some many steps along the way come on many uprisings and some down fallings come on I don't think anybody truly appreciates where they are in Christ unless they've had a few slack places along the way I'm not encouraging you to backslide but I think sometime when you reach for him and realize you've let him go right you wish not that the spirit of the Lord had departed I think that is the moment that you cry out to him in desperation and most of the time what do you find he keeps he comes rushing now don't you don't you disregard that wooing of the holy spirit because every time you reject him every time you turn him down every time you pass up his offer to pull you back into his side it gets harder and harder and harder and harder to find your way come on because you look at Christ like some of you have looked at your church history and let me tell you something he's none of that he's not a father like your father you may have had the most outstanding father but none like him you might not have had much of a father in your life but it's so common for people to look at God as they look at their Earthly father you've got to be free from that or you'll never you'll never understand that that he's your ABA that he's your Papa he is not out to get you he is out to get you he's not out to push you away he's out to draw you in he wants you to wear a yoke just not the Yoke of the world the Yoke of sin the Yoke of pharaoh the Yoke of hierarchy the Yoke of depression or addiction he wants you to wear his put that back up honey take my yoke upon you my yoke is a teaching yoke my yoke reveals something to you learn of me when you were hooked up to religion you were learning of religion when you were hooked up to some system you were learning the the edicts of the system but when you get hooked up to Christ when you wear his Yol he reveals to you brother not just on Sunday oh if you're one of them I don't know how you ever ever survive what's coming you can't feed on Sunday and no more you can't feed on Tuesday night and no more you've got to have an IV you've got to have an infusion you've got to be plugged into Christ you've got to draw him into your home every day with worship you got to have him riding in the automobile with you singing his Praises some of you need the cross on your rearview mirror because you take the Second Glance the enemy will appetize and sensationalize tantalize come on the BAM said I like to hang that there because when I come across some of that other stuff then I turn my head if a prophet had to do such a thing do you think you're so holy that you don't have to turn your eyes away from a half-dressed woman or and you don't you don't have to go to I mean maybe 25 years ago you had to go to a strip joint I guess to see something like that now just Walmart or church I don't like waterburger but I found myself in water Burger there was a young girl who came in and it broke my heart late it was after the concert because of the time difference I guess it wasn't quite as late for them as it was for us and she came in and her little outfit was underwear for people to wear the bed and here she comes walking through there just a young girl for 14 15 years old old biker group sitting over there at tables and your and and your heart there's no condemnation I don't want to condemn her I want to cover her up I'd like to give her my Overcoat I'd like to tell her that she's more valuable than a piece of meat I'd like to tell her if you could see how much Jesus loves you you wouldn't need the Google of some Old redneck hoodlum glaring at you like a hungry dog in a back of a pen somewhere you wouldn't need that for your affirmation you wouldn't need that for your approval And yet when we walk in somewhere we draw more attention more people turn their head to see us then they do that unless it's a man Googling at a woman like that breaks my heart because it's an advertisement no wonder there's a armed guard standing at the front of Waterberg in Montgomery I said to her do you have to be here all night she said no sir not all night just a 230 then the shift changes Whoever thought in a in in in a in your mind so many years ago you'd need a guard standing at the door of a burger place but that's the the the insanity of the world why would you choose to be a part of that when you can have everything you need sufficiently supplied for you in Christ he will give you your value once you take his yoke on you start learning who he is and who you are because you're in him and it satisfies the need for validation if you're not finding validation in Christ you need more of him that's right and that's not a condemnation that's an invitation come get more of him come get more of him so that he's what you love who you love above all else there's nothing no thing no one that means as much to you as your daily communion and your daily relationship with Jesus Christ we've got to get that way anybody helping me where am I at finishing that for I am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest unto your souls now that soul is your mind anybody ever need rest in your mind your will your will have you ever needed your will to behave silly boy we've all been there that will that that that that human will says it's so it's so much us it's so much of what we deal with that old will gets in there a Dollar 50 Cent $10 whatever standing in your way of doing what God wants you to do learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest for your mind your will and oh my there's another part of the Soul your emotions anybody ever have emotional issues don't worry we're not going to get the straight jacket out I'm very careful I I used to think that mental disease es or was a for you know just a certain group of people I have come to find out we can all have a little disease in our in our mental emotions come on we can get sidetracked in a hurry have you ever gone from zero to 50 everything feeling pretty good pretty calm and all of a sudden your heart racing your mouth dry your seconds that's a power of what an emotion can do and yet we we pray for you but we can't cast out your emotions because we can't cast out your soul it's a part of your tripartate man and remember if you follow follow this outline like I do in the scripture he gives us the order then you understand that your spirit is trying to feed it's trying to feed on Christ it's trying to feed on the world and your mind and your will and your emotion is trying to get between you and that word so that you can't feed who you really are and that's when you get the analogy of the stickman and the sumo wrestler because whatever part of your tripartate man you feed the most is going to be the biggest and that's why some of us are like a little toothpick in our spiritual man because the soul gets so caught up in its will and it's and its mind and and its emotions and we get so washed away in that and we become yolked by Temper fly off the handle I'm still preaching there's a half a dozen or more listening it's because we need rest we need rest and if you think I'm talking about a vacation I'm not because a vacation serves other purposes you don't usually get sleep on one though do you you run ragged you got to see it all and do it all and take it all in and you got to eat everywhere oh I got how got to stay another night cuz I got to eat there we get that way that's how we are and come home sometime exhausted Ben you're tired this morning keep waking him up there Kendra no I'm kidding it's not a vacation it's not a change of scenery people tell me through the years I need a little break from church no you don't need a break from church you need a break from you and you can't get out of you the only place that you can learn how is to get in his presence so that you can have some rest I mean rest I mean rest you see Sabbath is a whole lot more than 24 hours on a clock somewhere it's so much more it always was it was always pointing to someone yes sir not to something Jesus didn't think it was wrong to pluck kernels and feed his disciples on the Sabbath he didn't think it was wrong to pull the ox out of the ditch it's more than a day it's it's a place of living and when you are yolked into Christ you can find Sabbath more than Friday night to Saturday nighto if that's the only time we had peace in our life and rest in our life we'd be in trouble wouldn't we how many of you are glad you know the master of Sab you know him he is our peace he is our rest ye shall find rest for your souls Jesus said for my yoke next verse for my yoke is easy I guarantee you churchianity yoke isn't easy I guarantee you addiction yoke is not easy I guarantee you the yolks that we've wore through our life of pharaoh and all this stuff all all this stuff is heavy but Jesus said you take my Yol and you start learning of me I start revealing myself through you to you in you you take my yoke it's easy it's not a heavy burden it's not weighted down that's why God's people don't have to come to church like they're miserable that's why they don't have to drag in and sling their diaper bag on the seat comes sit down because life is hard and you ought have thought about how hard children can be when you started having them it's going to complicate everything I'm going to tell you right now everything in your life is going to be Complicated by children but they're worth the effort they're worth the effort it's a Ministry a Godly mother is a Ministry not only to her children but to her church and to her community she's doing the world around her a favor by pouring into her children it's a privilege and I know how hard it is sometime to get all the noses wiped and to get everything in place before you get to the house of God but you still don't have to come in and throw your diaper bag down and want everybody to know you're you're here I've arrive oh I lock because his yoke is easy and you see it as another opportunity to be in his presence we got to have his presence with us more than when we get here but you know what I mean coming together under a corporate anointing is so valuable and so precious well I don't get to hear what the preacher says you don't understand there are times you need to and there are time it's recorded for you and you can hear it again but there are times you just need to be here in his presence in the house angels are here the word is here the anointing is here you find rest some of you find spiritual rest and a nap you'll get a lot of rest paragraph 82 of the message Shalom and I'm going to close shortly yeah yeah you say that well I better not look here I'm getting more amens here than I am there than I am here he said that's the reason Jesus is coming for a chased virgin pure filled with the Holy Ghost and not of the world but of the power of God the paragraph before this I don't have it for you but he's talking about why Jesus had to come by a virgin he said that's the reason Jesus is coming and and look at that old church world out there trying now to say that it didn't mean vir meant just a young Maiden look at those Bible translations some of them nearly inspired some of them not inspired at all making you think that it was just a young average girl there who who was had has nothing to do with her Purity oh yes it did that's the reason Jesus is coming for a chased virgin pure filled with the Holy Ghost and there are times there are many times that we don't feel like any of that we feel used abused beat up knocked around nobody appreciates us on our job nobody appreciates us at home life is tough how are we ever going to be this we already are this this is who we are this is our true identity we have changed yolks the old yoke is destroyed the old man is gone he said that's the reason Jesus is coming for a Chase virgin pure filled with the Holy Ghost and not of the world but of the power of God how wonderful to know that there is a possibility to get into this group how do you do it you'll never do it by joining in two organization let's read on oh that's all of that one is no a little more you will do it when you are baptized by the Holy Spirit into the mystical body of Jesus Christ raised with him in Resurrection free from death and sin and then he said so it's not confessing to the preacher or the priest it's not lighting the candle it's not saying the Hail Mary it's not just by paying of your tithe not just by Church attendance it's not just by Modest dressing and living there's only one way that's the bloody way that's the bloody way in the revelation of Jesus Christ he simply said that's like the Virgin the word virgin means pure holy unadulterated Sanctified let me tell you something the M up people that some of us have been in our life we could never be any of this outside the blood oh my the blood should never be common to us when we sing a song about the blood that we've sung for 40 years it ought to mean as much to us today as it did the first time we ever sung it because it is our Redemption plan now I'm often reminded brother random said we're not saved by the blood we're saved by grace but it's very very important to see how that fits in the scripture and how that fits in the scripture is the Bible said you're saved not of Works you're saved by grace salvation is of Grace it's the grace of God that brought the blood to your house the blood is the token price of your Redemption you could not have been redeemed without the blood to say you could be saved without the blood is wrong because there had to be a token price but the grace the grace that he was preaching about was the transportation that brought the blood to you my God thank you by Grace I'm saved the grace brought me to the blood the grace brought the blood to me that's the Virgin the word means pure holy unadulterated Sanctified one more and we're closed things that are to be 62 but the other one is called my father's house I'll go and prepare a place for you take you out of this pest house and deliver you into my father's house house amen there you are take you out of this old Earthly pest house how many of you are looking for that change one day it kind of It kind of struck me good the old songs we were singing this morning I knew some of you thought what in the world everyone's old everyone's old I remember how happy I was when I heard that rising up song being sung in youth camps and youth meetings around the message thrill me has a little life to it might not have been written in the 50s but it has a little life in it we need that sometime All Good gospel songs don't have to be written a generation ago there's people in this bride that have inspiration to write beautiful music and there are other people out there in systems because you start examining the religious background of some of the old great hymns and you will quickly come to the understanding that most of them were trinitarians most of them baptized in titles and yet they found inspiration to write the songs that we sing and praise God about today so the holy spirit will lead you to what's for you and what's not for you but I resent people having an attitude that it has to be in the only beli book before we can use it in church that's a Creed it's a Creed hello it's a dogma and I'm not going to carry that Creed or that Dogma but it sure felt good today and I'll tell you why it reminded me of my childhood not because of the words of the song only but because of the look of the people when I was a boy in the Pentecostal church it was tough the people that went to to to my granny's church the church I grew up in were poor people there was not a new car in the parking lot there wasn't a 2-year-old car in the parking lot unless my granny had it and and that wasn't because of the church that was because of her income tax income she was a preparer for income tax people worked in the cotton meals and the hosery meals and the denim meals of Columbus Mogi County and they work split shift work sometimes second sometimes third sometimes first and second they were wore out most everybody in the church I grew up in had bags under their eyes very few suits among them mostly freshly pressed denim jeans cuffed by the way was country people they' moved to the city to find a better life and had raised their children to find a better life and they maybe a little better than the farm but it wasn't too Swift there was one nephew of my grandmother who who was in the church and he had a little bit of money he made $10 an hour and that was big money in the in the 70s but he had a lot of children when those people would come to church and and the singing would start they would they would look so tired when they come in especially on a Tuesday night you'd think we will we we w't hard to get through this service they'll be asleep before the first hym weary looking but I want you to know when they started singing those songs here's what it helped them do they got their eyes off of their circumstances and they got their eyes on the promise oh my did they come alive did they come alive the music they could pump out of that accordion talk about heavy-handed piano players they didn't think if you if you didn't pound the piano they didn't think you was a piano player there was no no playing no no caressing the keys the the harder they bang the more anointed they felt I don't care how tired and how weary they were when they got in that atmosphere of singing them old songs I wouldn't take nothing for my journey now got my hand on the gospel plow and I'm Holding On Heaven's Jubilee every song pointing either to the blood or to Eternity and if you get your eyes on the blood or you get your eyes on eternity I tell you you can you can make your way through the stuff a perfect place he's gone to prepare a place where no evil exists no sickness exists no old age exist no death exist it's a perfect place calling you to that Perfection and then there's this phrase here don't let it upset you and you have to be perfect to get there well how many of you feel disqualified all of us should in the natural if we're thinking carnal thoughts I know some perfect messes but I don't know any perfect people in the natural and yet he said you you got to be perfect to get there the Bible said so and it does Jesus said be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect there has to be a way for us there has to be a way for us let's go on it's a perfect Kingdom so it must be a perfect people come because you have to stand and be married to a perfect Son of God here it is some were married to churches and some were married in sin and some were married to this and some were married to that and some married to drugs you've got to be married to a perfect son the perfect Son of God and you must be a perfect bride so how can you do it through anything else but the perfect word of God every provision we need to be everything he's called us to be is supplied for us by fellowshipping that word because that word is not here it's here which is the Waters of Separation back to the red he that washes us from our sins it separates us your sin on one side you're on the other side you once wore a yoke of those sin now you're wearing the Yoke of the Lord amen that's right the blood of Jesus Christ think of it dripping bloody word the word the blood the word of God bleeding blood to wash the bre died in amen yes sir she stands perfect and she hasn't been she stands virgin and she hasn't been she stands unadulterated and she hasn't been why because of the blood and then look at that next phrase she never sinned in the first place is that all you got let's have some come on you say something that profound and you're afraid to say come on because you're afraid I will I'm done this is done this is me nearly done musicians are coming she never sinned in the first place Hallelujah you see all that took place place in the realm of time and she's Eternal what's living inside of you is not of time this life of Jesus Christ is in you always has been always will be it is eternal so your body is existing in the realm of time but who you really are is drawing from the Eternal if you believe that say Amen so no matter what it was whether it was yesterday or 45 years ago what whatever it was if you have come under that blood if you have let the anointing presence of God destroy that old yoke and you are now wearing the Yoke of the Lord the Yoke of the word the Yoke of the blood he looks at you and this is the testimony this is what is announced over your life you never sinned in the first place Hallelujah is that too big to believe and and listen at this strategy she was trapped into it Satan laid a trap for you because you came here with a Target you know that Old Devil he learns by OB observation you might learn something if you'll be quiet and watch he learns by observation and he started watching people's life down Through the Ages and he must have discovered a pattern that follows the chosen of the Lord and once he discovered that he took full advantage of that and therefore by the time you came along all these Generations later he identified you way back as being one of his God's the father's not not his and by that he did everything he could to lay trap after trap after trap for you in your life because he never wanted you to get to the Yoke of the Lord he didn't mind you wearing the Yoke of of whatever else I don't even really like to keep naming it over and over again lust or whatever it is he he he was happy if he could put that on your shoulder but the minute you came under the influence of that blood and you started fellowshipping with the pure word the Virgin word the unadulterated word and that anointing came to destroy the Yoke in your life and to set you free and you said hey here's a Yol I don't mind wearing this is easy this one talks to me about who he is brother there's so much Revelation if you'll put the Yoke of the Lord on if if you'll turn the idiot box off and let the Holy Ghost talk to you from the book she never sinned in the first place she was trapped into it see there's the father's house that he has gone to prepare is that all of that one how many of you have got

you can't quite get out from under it well I just want to say one more time he's got it he has a yoke to replace all yolks his is not a heaviness on your shoulder or in your heart his is freedom and lightness and wholeness maybe it doesn't come instantaneously it's a journey toward him there's no doubt about it we're being restored back to his side but oh I'm telling you something the journey is a whole lot sweeter when you recognize the one that's walking with you and I just wonder right now if you are if you're here a saint of God a child of God or one who has known the Lord or maybe one who's just not fellowshipping with him at all but but you know that there's some there there's some control issues there's some stuff going on that's trying to dictate some stuff to you control some things in your mind and you'd like to have some help from the Lord today would you just slip up your hand just wherever you are many that's that's us it's us why don't we pray together why don't we get a hold of God together if there are any of the rest of you that would want to join us you're so welcome to do that it's not necessary but you're certainly welcome to come this way we're just going to pray together we're just going to pray a corporate prayer now if you're standing by someone and you happen to notice that they raise their hand put your hand on a shoulder just reach over and touch him on the arm brother to brother sister to sister uh whatever is appropriate and let's ask the Lord to help him get out from under that thing and to to wear a new Yol oh one that's not burdensome and one that's easy one that it's refreshing the one that keeps us going it's the Yoke of the word it's the truth of God that's come to set us free let's pray right now father in the name of Jesus when I look out across this house I see the cream of the crop I see the best of the best I see those that you have saved and redeemed and rescued out of the pit it is not surprising to me that the enemy would like to put a yoke a burden some heavy yoke on their shoulder join them to something other than Christ but today by the life of that blood we move against that now and we decree and declare in the name of Jesus that this is a war that Satan has already lost you may have trapped us into some things but those things are not our identity we have chosen a new Yol one of Purity one of wholeness one that is based on the unadulterated word of God and because of that word we're freed we're freed our minds are freed we can have control over our emotions we recognize that Satan has tried to kill us but God's Grace has saved us again and again and again and so with every breath we want to give you praise Lord with every moment we want to we want to give you glory and we want to give you honor and we want to say it's because of you we're not where we are today because of our own strength or power we're where we are today because of your Mighty blood because of the quickening life the quickening power of the Holy Ghost [Music] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah brother gy would you do me a favor would you go back there and stand next to Josh a minute I don't want to embarrass him he doesn't know me and I don't want to embarrass him but I I would just like for you if he didn't mind for you to just touch him on shoulder and let me pray I'm doing this because I am convinced I don't know a lot of the details of uh his life I just know a a mom and a dad that asked prayer for him a lot but I know he could have he could have been killed just recently and I know that it wasn't chance or look that has preserved his life I know enough about how this thing works to know he was kept and preserved yes to serve the Lord and I don't want to embarrass him in any way and and Stephen Beth you can tell him just how I am I'm just pling vanilla but I had to do that so the rest of us are just staying where we are but this prayer is for our young brother we're thanking God for his life being preserved he's had a hard road but God has preserved him and kept him for a purpose so we are agreeing in prayer right now now Lord I don't know the destiny that you have for this young man but you do and that's why you have protected him and that's why you have held on to him when he couldn't hold on to you and I didn't want to miss this opportunity to celebrate in his presence the goodness of God that I recognize in his life so today we give you thanks God we thank you that you have saved his life physically naturally we thank you for what you have done in his inner man we ask oh God that you will continue to work him in this journey that the very life of Jesus Christ will penetrate every part of who he is let every fiber of his being be filled with the life of Jesus Christ we speak to Darkness and we command you to go you are a trespasser he is a son of light we command you to go in the authority of Jesus Christ give him a praise give him a song give him a purpose give him a reason for holding on oh God your beautiful Grace your beautiful Grace is what has kept him we are depending on you to keep him the rest of this journey may he find total freedom may he find everything that he needs in Christ and may he always know from this day forward that there's a group of people out here on the county road that's praying for him to overcome to succeed to be all that a Son of God should be Lord thank you thank you we give you praise and honor and Glory it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that we believe for him and with him and the
