TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Somebody said, "Wouldn't it be wonderful to live like that with the absence of fear?" I am here to tell you today that that is the inheritance of the bride. If you could recognize, if I could recognize who I am, there would be the absence of fear. We would recognize that he's on board. Doesn't matter whether he's sleeping or whether he's awake. He's on board. He's on board. He's in the midst of the storm. He's in the midst of the anxiety, the trouble. He's in the midst of the crisis. He's in the midst of the chaos. And I believe there's a people being prepared and positioned in this hour to live in the absence of fear, to live in the absence of anxiety, to live with the authority of the bridegroom. I believe it. this reality of sitting together with him in heavenly places. Oh, brother, sister, above it all. Above it all in heavenly places and and not even having to come down to go to work because it's a spiritual position with a cancer diagnosis. You don't have to come down to go and do your job. You don't have to come down because it's a spiritual positioning. It's a placement of the whale sons, the mature sons of God. Those who used to suck the bottle, but they no longer have to suck the bottle because they have cut their teeth on the meat of the revelation of who Jesus Christ is. Not a historical figure but the living word. Not only among us [Music] but in us. That's our reality. I know we get disturbed daily. And you know why that happens? Because we allow it. We make excuses to live below our means. What about somebody deciding, I'm not going to make excuses for my lack of faith anymore. I'm going to find what it is that needs to be awakened in me. I'm going to find the missing piece that needs to come to life in me so that I can begin to use the authority that's mine. It's bridal inheritance. It's the inheritance of the wife, the voice of the bridegroom in the bride. Whose voice is going to talk through the trouble? The bridegroom's voice. That's his authority. That's what it's talking about. I want to see some miracles. I want to see some miracles in this house. I want to see some chronic conditions go. I want to see some people that have suffered for years wait it out and move in this place of authority and come back. I I have I've lived under the burden of this infirmity my whole life, but I'm made whole. I am 100% made whole. Well, what did what happened? What? I guess brother so and so prayed for you. I guess this one prayed for you and saw a vision and everything turned out all right. No, I just made up my mind that I had authority in his name by his blood with his word. I had authority to make my storm We don't understand the authority that has been given to us. Somebody said, "Well, I've tried it and it didn't work before." Line up your life. Let your life line up. Make a little effort. Make sure there's no dead cats on the line. Make sure there's no unrepented sin in your life. Make sure you've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Make sure you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost. The one who walks and talks. The one who's ever more alive. The one that causes you to have strength to live above sin. The one that deals with temptation in your life. That Holy Ghost. That one. That one. That one that'll take you out of yourself and plunge you in the realm of spirit. The one that can rescue you from your own flesh and put you in a dimension of supernatural existence. Come on. That one that we need him. We need the Holy Ghost. Not a feeling, not an emotion, not a thrill. We need the person, the reality of Jesus Christ. Amen. You're living in an hour greater greater than the generations before you. You're living in an hour where God said, "I'm going to manifest sons on the earth." Amen. I was the seed that went in the ground. Our Lord said, "You're the harvest." You'll never get that by visiting him casually from time to time. You'll only find that place when you hang with him. When you choose him over and over and over and over and over and over in
