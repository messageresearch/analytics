TRANSCRIPT
========================================
praise is a powerful weapon if you always want to win in your life you have to cultivate an attitude of gratitude if you always want to win in every battle of your life you have to cultivate an attitude of praise and of worship True Praise releases power and true power inspires more sincere praise do you understand yes sir if you want Power with God we need Authority it's ours but if you want to see Power on display praise him not just with your song with your life not with just with your mouth with your life you can't change the fact that he's sitting on the throne Eternal you can't change the fact that he's still king of kings and Lord of Lords but when you're not giving him a place to sit when you're not building him a house to live in when you're not making him a habitation to dwell in you're taking him off his throne in your life your attitude while you wait on God your attitude while you wait on God to bring his word to pass is vitally important for the measure of your promise for the measure of your Harvest that's right brother if you wait and Grumble if you wait and murmur if you wait and make excuses for your life one day I'm going to serve him with everything I've got you don't get to choose that now is the time now is the acceptable hour to have a relationship with him I'm in a personal relationship with him where your desire is to overcome and make it and your desire for those around you is that they also overcome and make it I know what my praise has cost me hello I don't know what yours has cost you but I know the price of mine and it's valuable to me because the battle was hard come on the suffering was hard the trial was hard so the praise ought to match the intensity of the fire hallelujah hallelujah my praise ought to match the intensity of my trial you don't really believe that everybody ought to praise the Lord like that do you I didn't write this book let the high let the high praises of God be in their mouth and a two-edged sword in their hand remember we're not preaching on worship I'm preaching on praise and I don't care what the charismatics say until they learn the beauty of Praise they may call it worship all day long but that don't make it worship you've got to learn you've got to learn the tool you've got to learn the tool of Praise you've got to learn the effectiveness of High Praise it's got to become a revelation to you and you've got to get in that place so that the glory comes that's what breaks open the atmosphere but you don't want to live there you want to come on in praise breaks open the heaven worship lets the heaven come down it works together
