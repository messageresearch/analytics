[0:00] time is running
[0:02] out the sand is almost out of The
[0:07] Hourglass it really is we are just a few
[0:12] seconds until midnight and time will be
[0:16] no more eternity will break upon us and
[0:20] there's only one thing that's going to
[0:22] matter as that eternity breaks upon us
[0:26] and that is did you have
[0:28] Christ how much of him did you allow to
[0:31] be formed in
[0:34] you that's going to determine the
[0:39] [Music]
[0:41] bride because here we hope and we feel
[0:46] and we some of us have Revelation that
[0:49] we're a part of that number but for many
[0:53] there's that nagging doubt in the back
[0:56] of their mind am I really one of those
[0:58] well let me tell you something the more
[1:00] of Christ you allow to be formed in you
[1:03] you are
[1:04] demonstrating What gene you are of what
[1:08] DNA you carry and there are some folks
[1:11] here this morning they may not be the
[1:14] loudest they may not be the most popular
[1:17] but there are some folks here in this
[1:19] house today who I know beyond the shadow
[1:22] of a doubt carry the gene seed of
[1:25] God it's going to
[1:27] matter it's going to matter because
[1:29] because their spiritual DNA is going to
[1:32] kick in and give them strength to stand
[1:36] against the last raging storm of
[1:42] leoda leoda is not finished shaking its
[1:47] tail there's a little more to get over
[1:50] but I'm going over I'm going over by the
[1:54] help and grace of God you look at the
[1:56] law as a mirror you see how short you
[1:59] are you you see your pimple you see your
[2:02] crooked nose you see then Grace comes
[2:06] and Grace changes the mirror because
[2:09] you're no longer seeing how ugly you are
[2:11] when you look in the mirror in fact if
[2:13] you're looking like the Apostle Paul
[2:15] said you're not seeing yourself at all
[2:17] you're seeing the Lord Jesus there and
[2:20] you know the Bible says we are
[2:23] changed this is powerful scripture we're
[2:27] Changed by looking upon him
[2:30] the more you look at him
[2:33] haa the more we look at Jesus in his
[2:36] word the more we see his Perfection the
[2:39] more like him we
[2:41] become my goodness so if you if you're
[2:44] one of those who continues to want to
[2:46] see your crooked nose and your you know
[2:49] and your droopy eye and your Crow feet
[2:54] if you keep seeing that you how in the
[2:57] world will you ever have any passion or
[2:59] motivation to be more like him you think
[3:02] he's forsaken me I'm looking uglier by
[3:06] the minute this is not working when I
[3:10] look all I see is my is my bad thoughts
[3:13] and all I see is my shortcomings and all
[3:17] I see is my failures and and how I don't
[3:20] measure up but you catch a revelation of
[3:23] him and let him be your vision come on
[3:26] somebody and the Bible said we're
[3:28] changed from glory to Glory we're
[3:30] transfigured is the right we're
[3:32] transfigured by seeing him look Upon
[3:35] Jesus and live brother Venom preached
[3:38] look
[3:40] away that means you may not see him if
[3:43] all you're doing is looking at your
[3:45] present circumstances and Surround Look
[3:47] Away to him
