2700 Plus and we Joyce and I visited a little church on Wednesday after we left you Tuesday night we drove up into Ohio and visited a church we had never been to and we had plans for Thursday and instead my wife spent most of the day in the bed at the hotel but the Lord came through and touched her and we rearranged our journey or God rearranged our journey we just were following what he was leading and and by the grace of God we were able to go on and do what we were called to do last Sunday I thank you for praying for us we had two good Services we we dealt with a couple of sacred cows last Sunday night but uh we were still invited back for next year so apparently we're we're all right and I'm thankful for that and then God gave us the grace to travel on down to First into Missouri we were supposed to see brother Truman and sister Martha but there was some sickness in their household and we already had enough of that so we didn't want any more of it so we diverted and stopped to see my aunt and uncle who have made a move from Dallas Texas to Springfield Missouri Assembly of God Minister my uncle is and uh they're in the process today as his last service he was an interim pastor in Dallas Texas but now they're making the move back to Springfield Missouri after he retired from the Dallas Teen Challenge and then we want to welcome sister Terry Lawler and her mother sister Gert Hammond their first service here as residents of Alabama we're grateful to the Lord that they're here we left Springfield Missouri and drove down into Mountain Home and uh sister Rebecca had already been there and the truck was loaded by a group of men the day before and so we got here late on Friday night sister Terry has been a part of our congregation sister Gert they've been a part of our congregation by way of live stream but now they don't have to live stream they're live with us praise the Lord [Applause] the Lord is so faithful and he is he is moving and I know that a couple more of the girls are there wanting to be here bad we want to pray them all the way through asking the Lord to make that way to our visitors we welcome you today didn't get a chance to greet you but we welcome you in the name of the Lord and ask the Lord to bless you while you're here we're so happy that we could all be gathered together and those that couldn't be here maybe they're on the other end of this stream we have come to give God the praise and the glory that is due his name in the good times and in the bad times he is worthy of our praise and we want to give him the worthy praise that he deserves and we have come to hear the word and we are thankful that God has let us have eyes to see and ears to hear that we can keep marching forward toward the end of time and see the manifestation of the sons of God that we can be a part of his glorious outpouring in this end time we're thankful for that uh Jaya they tell me that you have a song we're going to invite you to come and minister to us in song We'll worship with you we want to receive the tithe and the offering today but I would like to give you a new loan balance of 26 521.12 oh praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord Hallelujah Glory behind us is 441 468.57 cents and we give God the praise because he let us get that behind us hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the Lord so we want to receive the tithe and the offering today we want you to give as giving unto the Lord we're running a bit short on the insurance and so if you have some extra that you would let the Lord speak to you and you'd sow into the kingdom of God for the insurance on this property you see every building that we have has to be insured and and besides insurance we now have to have a coverage with the Lee County Fire Department they want to know every square foot that we have that needs to be protected by the fire department and so there is a price to pay for that it's just recently till the uh it's just come to us that we've got to pay this fee to the uh to the fire department to for for com because it's commercial and so we had to go measure every structure to make sure that we were being fair with them and so all of it and so uh these are expenses but God gave it to us and we have been called here to work together and so we want together to see this all taken care of the insurance very expensive and as you know with your own homeowners insurance because the price of materials has gone up the price of insurances have gone up all of these things contribute but I'm so thankful that my papa my papa knows how to provide and if we commit ourselves to him he'll take good care of us he won't leave us destitute he won't leave us hungry he won't leave us out in the cold he'll take care of us if we'll commit our ways to the Lord he will take good care of us so brother Elias and brother Austin Yantis will you two brothers go to the people today for the tithe and the offering we bless you

you may be seated today it's wonderful to be in the house of the Lord and we have quite a few missing this morning and sometimes as I said to the folks in the back as we're praying for the service we have to work a little harder to make up for those who are unable to be here but thank you so much for being faithful today and thank you for taking praise and worship serious it is very very very very very serious and thank you for taking it as such uh we have had a a busy week and a trying week but God is faithful this morning he never leaves us he never forsakes us uh he is yes and amen and I I I maybe I repeat it too often in my prayers I if there's one thing I don't like I I maybe I'll just Express one of my pet peeves when people pray and I hear them pray publicly if they're leading us in prayer it really disturbs me when I hear people say lord lord lord lord lord lord Our Father father father father I don't ever want to be guilty of a vain repetition when we use the name of the Lord we're supposed to attach Faith to it every time so so if we get shocked and we say Lord you better be sure that you're putting Faith with that Lord you're calling on him to help you otherwise you're using his name in vain I don't want to do that I maybe I have another vain repetition because I often say God you are sovereign and you are God's Supreme I don't mean that to be a repetition but I find myself saying it more and more I have to be reminded that he is Sovereign he didn't he doesn't owe me any explanation I know inquiring minds want to know but he doesn't owe me any explanation he is Sovereign in all of his ways he is God's Supreme there are there are there are there's no other God among the gods the Bible says among all the gods that people worship there's only one true Living God and uh he never makes a mistake and we come to realize that in the difficult times as well as in the beautiful and amazing times let me get this out of the way uh because we want to move on to something else before we approach the word uh tomorrow uh well let me first say today is Sister Rona Ryder's birthday and they are streaming the service from Cape Town South Africa and we want to wish our sister Rona a happy happy birthday and I haven't had any other uh news or confirmation except that you all were hoping to be here and I hope I'm going to see you in a few weeks I hope we get to give you a a handshake a hug for happy birthday but if not then know that we're thinking about you in Cape Town today and appreciate your love for us and for this ministry tomorrow is Cynthia Symphony Symphony she has a new name Cindy and Anthony's wedding anniversary I I realize that it's been many years since they have been able to be in service with us but they are a faithful part of this church I hear from Sister Cindy every week I know that they're there they support this church and we love them very very much both of them and we want to wish them a very happy wedding anniversary on Monday and just thank the Lord for that uh Tuesday I have written down April oh I was about to really get confused April I was wondering why I wrote down the month instead of a name oh my I was fixing to check myself because I put Tuesday April and then a year which I'm not going to name the year but I had written that down in my notes I better pay attention to what I'm doing had my Tuesday is April's birthday she happens to share her name with the month uh would you all wish her a happy birthday today Wednesday is Sister Cheryl Hawk's birthday and although they have a church they are very very faithful streamers in Tucson and we love them very much and I happen to see her so I will uh wish her a happy birthday as well and then Friday night is uh is heir of Sukkot and so that is the evening that begins uh Sukkot or Tabernacles time and I think most of you know that this evening as the sun goes down uh Yom Kippur or the day of atonement begins and we'll Minister a little bit about that in just a few minutes for those of you who who are not here Tuesday night uh and especially after the service we shared a few things with you uh concerning sister Royale and uh her health has not been good for some time now but she received a diagnosis this week that none of us really expected and uh that was that she has cancer in the bone and it has spread quite rapidly and uh to to many places in her body and that was only on the first part of the week Monday is when we went there with the family to share with them the news and then on Friday uh she really had a rough day a horrible day and it was very very hard to be with her and to see her in that condition and so nauseated from the pain medication uh and you know to see her vomiting and and and just struggling really struggling and and yet in in pain uh even with the with the medication so the family reached out to see what they might be able to do because uh without a without a further diagnosis to know where the cancer might have started um it's a little bit hard to know what they're dealing with and uh she's certainly not able to go through anything like that any further testing so on Friday she was transferred Friday evening to the hospice house in Columbus and it has been a wonderful blessing uh because they are able to control as much as possible the symptoms of the vomiting the nausea and control the pain and so she's resting she rested uh pretty good last night every couple hours she would stir for just a little bit and uh there will be confusion that goes along with the medication and she really needs our prayers I plan to to go there this afternoon late and and see her we asked Mary Beth today because she and Annabelle are are doing a a wonderful job in helping take care of sister Royale and sister Weems was there all day yesterday yesterday and we asked Mary Beth what would be the best way to approach visitors and at this time they're not going to receive visitors at the hospice other than the immediate family and that is simply because she needs as much rest as she possibly can she's not recognizing everything that's going on or everyone that is coming in and there are other ways that we can express our love for sister Weems we have to make sure that she's eating like a queen because she needs her strength and so anything that we can do for her for Hawk and meribeth as well who we're loaning loaning Hawk an extra vehicle of ours today my wife's vehicle because it's been hard going and dropping off and and coming back and forth in the morning and in the evening and in the night and uh they are having to scrape around to try to feed themselves while while also being there as much as possible I know I'm stammering around forgive me I I'm just laying it out the best I can if you want to do something for them uh it would be amazing they might need a babysitter sometime they might need uh might be nice to have a gift card to grab a meal or put something in the refrigerator for them to have later all we know is that God is sovereign and God is supreme many years ago you know that there was a vision of the platform down here under the Tabernacle and I saw Royale walking unhindered without any any limitations to her body and uh she claimed that and has claimed that her entire life here as a promise from the Lord that she would get her healing and I'm here to tell you she will she will she will either the angel of the Lord will either go by and visit her at the hospice house and bring her out and I know what your carnal mind is telling you but it lies it lies I I will tell you this I would not be completely shocked if the phone call came and said come get her you know he is so able he's so able I I uh hesitate to even share those I have those thoughts but I hesitate to share them because some people see things like that as giving people a false hope or something you know they say say it like that if you've got hope in the doctors it's false because they'll surely failure they're just humans and remember they're practicing medicine they're wonderful to have around when you need them but they're practicing but if you have hope in the Lord you're never disappointed you're never disappointed because she's either going to receive her complete and total healing unhindered and unable to walk to I mean completely able to walk around without pain you know she had the replacement and then she had had the stroke and she's not going in the right direction for for that to take place but God knows how to come even in the Midnight Hour she's either going to get a whole body here or a whole body there and as recently as Monday night when we were sharing with her the news can you imagine seeing your whole family come in and your pastor and his wife come in all at one time it it couldn't be real good but she had the sweetest spirit and she said I'm not worried and I'm not scared that was the first words that come out of her mouth now that's pretty impressive you've just told someone that the that there's cancer in the chest bone in the thoracic and the lumbar spine that means the upper spine and the and the bottom of the spine and in the skull and they say I'm not worried and I'm not scared only faith in a genuine God could say something like that and uh later she said I was just thinking today I have a promise and I'm holding on to that promise if it doesn't turn out the way that we want it we in in reflecting and seeing that in my mind her walking across that platform my logical uh interpretation and thought would be well in order for that to come to pass she has to physically walk across that platform but my spiritual mind and my faith tells me that that God knew when he gave that exactly how it would be and she will either do it in a restored physical body or she'll do it in a glorified theophany body but she will receive her healing I am convinced of that 100 percent but you need to know that her condition is grave and that it has happened so quickly the very fact that doctors had no idea what was going on uh until until really a diagnosis only came Monday lets me know that God God knew this he had this in his mind there's a reason why uh it didn't come earlier that would have perhaps been a uh a desire for us for her to fight that and that would have been all kinds of of radiation and all kinds of chemotherapy and all kinds of things that uh if if it could have been caught early enough that would have even further deteriorated the quality of her life God wouldn't have wanted that for her when she was presented with the option of seeing the specialist and seeing what kind of treatment would be available she immediately knew that that was not what she wanted to do and she was of sound mind at that time and able to make that decision decision so I want us to pray with everything that we have that God's perfect will is done that there is no shaking in our faith that we will trust the Lord we will continue to believe in the Supernatural and uh I haven't changed my mind I know that she's got a new body one that will I just wish there was time I I shared reminders with my family her story the bits and pieces I shared with you Tuesday night she has been a walking miracle walking Miracle uh thought to be dead 40 something years ago at the scene of a horrendous accident that separated part of her brain tissue from her skull never expected to communicate or walk again and God gave her some beautiful years she saw her family flourishing around her she has uh Joseph and Rebecca and and Esther who have loved on her and have brought so many smiles to her face and her mother has been with her from the beginning of her life can you imagine only a very short time have they had to live apart sister Weems moved into the hospital and rearranged her life so many times even after Royale was married and we want to pray for special strength today for sister Weems and for the whole family uh as they came to get her on Friday afternoon uh you know you always stand back and let them do their thing and uh I just had a desire to get closer to her and have been had been with her for several hours but she was resting a good portion of that time thank God because when she wasn't resting she was very sick I stepped out on the porch in my sock feet when they when they uh had carried her out and then and then put her on the stretcher on the porch and the uh attendant said how about you sir would you come here and help me I I thought that was very strange all I did was Hold On To The Strokes to the to the stretcher so that it didn't roll away when they put her on it but I was so thankful I just wanted to be as close to her at that moment as I possibly could and we cried out to her you know as she was going we love you and we're praying for you uh I have a beautiful memory that I'm not going to let anything take from me I wrote it down so that if I live long enough to need to read it I will uh if it should Escape my mind and that is as they as they got her out there to put her in the ambulance and they had to clear the door so they had to swing swing around and Justice they were swinging the door she threw up her hand and waved at me and I appreciated that so much uh so thankful for her life and we'll be thrilled if Tuesday night uh she walks in here well and whole uh you know I I'm not prepared I don't think physically prepared for that kind of Revival yet can you imagine what that would do uh it would certainly draw some attention to the king that would be our desire but if God has another thought I promise you I woke up this morning my song this morning when I woke up was uh if I survey all the good things that come to me from above should I count all the blessings from his Storehouse of Love I'd simply ask for one favor of him Beyond mortal men I'm sure he would Grant it again and again the chorus I want to stroll over heaven with you some sweet day when all of our troubles and sorrows heartaches are vanished away then we'll enjoy the beauty where all things are new I want to stroll over heaven with you and that is not

wasn't able to make a a an evening to do that I'm going to go over to hospice this afternoon after lunch early evening the Lord willing and I will be back here to the campground at some point so some of you younger ones that were on the list if you're here uh then I will I would be able to see you then I can't make any commitments unless it's an emergency for any night this coming week I don't know what the week holds just like your week I don't want to schedule something and not be able to uh to to take care of it and I want to tell you that other than the duties that I will have to uh perform I'm going to rest as much as I possibly can physically this week because next week well there's no rest then amen so if if you have an emergency we will make it happen uh again I will be back here sometime late this afternoon so there's a couple of you that are younger and you would might would be here and if you're not you might want to plan to be and we could take care of it if you're still interested then the rest of you if it's not emergency we'll get to it we certainly will uh and know that I'm praying there's power in prayer oh God answers prayer doesn't he all right Hebrews chapter 9 I had so much fun Tuesday night with you all and and doing a little bit of expository preaching I don't get to do that too often anymore just going through uh verse by verse it's my favorite way to preach but it's just not really what a pastor does most of the time I like taking it verse by verse the problem with that is you get so many trails going at one time you never do get back to all of them but let's go there this morning for just a moment Hebrews chapter 9 I'm going to read a few verses and then I'll let you have your seat then verily the first Covenant had also ordinances of divine service and a worldly Sanctuary which means of the Earth for there was a tabernacle made for those of you who enjoy knowing the Hebrew word for things the the Tabernacle is the Hamish Khan mishkan in Hebrew is Tabernacle ha when you put the word letters H A in front of it it means thee so if you say Hamish Khan you mean the Tabernacle uh when that Tabernacle was made the first wherein was the Candlestick and the table and the shoe bread which is presence bread which is called the sanctuary and after the second Veil The Tabernacle which is called the holiest of all we sometimes refer to it as the holy of holies which have the golden sensor and the Ark of the Covenant overlaid roundabout with gold wherein was the golden pot that had Manna Aaron's Rod that flooded and the tables of the Covenant you remember that's the stone tablets that the Commandments were written on and over it it the cherubims of Glory shadowing The Mercy Seat now remember these cherubims are Heavenly Creatures we refer to them sometimes as Angels they were created as Guardians of the glory oh my can you imagine that responsibility to be Guardians of the glory you and I are very similar to the cherubims in our broad Ministry did you understand that because we are also Guardians of the glory to call the precious things of God precious the holy things holy and those things which are profane we have to call them profane if we're going to guard the glory we have to say what God says we have to love what he loves and we have to hate what he hates that's not always easy but it's a responsibility of those who are called to guard the glory the heaviness of his presence all right uh shadowing The Mercy Seat remember they sat on top of The Mercy Seat their wings touching and the promise of the Lord was I will meet you there between the wings of the cherubims of which we cannot now speak particularly now when these things were thus ordained the priests went also into the first Tabernacle accomplishing the service of God that is the daily order of of the work and Ministry of the sanctuary but into the second the holy of holies went the high priest alone once every year so this evening at sundown we commemorate as do Jews around the world we commemorate that one day of the year that the high priest was allowed to come in behind the veil into the holy of holies he could not come without blood he had to come in with blood which he offered for himself and for the errors of the people all right let's go on just a moment the Holy Ghost this signifying that the way somebody say the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while as the first Tabernacle was yet standing that is important to note as long as the Tabernacle was standing as long as the Earthly Temple was standing the Holy Ghost is teaching us that a way had not yet been made so that all men we should say all priests because how many of you know your ministry is one of Priestly order amen and not all priests could go in behind that Veil until the first Tabernacle was done away with and the Earthly Temple was done away with you become the Temple of the most high God that is not to say that the Jews will not do everything within their power to rebuild a third physical Temple we don't know how successful they will be but we know that according to the Book of Ezekiel there will be a restored temple in the new Earth we know that and the the not only do we know that but we know the dimensions of the millennial Temple and when we translate those Dimensions into Earthly measurements we find out that the present Temple Mount would not hold the temple that Ezekiel measured it would cover the entire city Old City and New City of Jerusalem can you imagine what a glorious place of worship is going to be built for us in the Millennium huge so much bigger than any Temple and that will only always remain a shadow it was always God's intention to dwell in men he wanted to live in men he wanted the Tabernacle in men are you still with me let's do just a few more verses and then you can sit down which was a figure a type a symbol for the time then present in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience which stood only in Meats and drinks and diverse Washings and carnal ordinances imposed on them until read that for me how many of you are glad for reformation two more verses and you can have your seat but Christ but Christ no matter what has been said but Christ no matter what has been done but mashiach the anointed one the Christ being come and high priest of good things to come even his coming was a prophecy that better things would follow by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle mishkan not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his what on blood he entered in once into the holy place if as this day goes by you think at all about it being Yom Kippur this evening the day of atonement if at any time tomorrow it crosses your mind that Jews around the world are fasting for 25 or 26 hours they are fasting hoping that their works all right we'll inscribe their name one more year in The Book of Life if you think of that you better remember that once and for all Christ with blood entered in behind the veil not with blood of goats and calves but with his own blood he entered in once into the holy Place having obtained you read the rest eternal not temporal Eternal Redemption for us brother Greeley would you pray yes yes Hallelujah [Music] and the saint said you may be seated please keep your attention on the word now in in verse 10 if you will go back there it's talking about the ordinance of the law which stood only in meats and drinks and divers Washings and carnal ordinances imposed on them until the time of reformation that word Reformation in the Greek is diathosis and the word diarthosis means rectification it means something being totally set right or rectified it is a process leading to a new order I want somebody to say a new order to be realized when the scripture scriptures offerings and ordinances of Tabernacle worship and Temple worship were imposed on the believer until the time of reformation it could read just as easily until the time of the New Order I want you to remember that there is a new order in place it would not matter if the Jews were to be able to rebuild the Third Temple I personally believe they will it's my my thoughts that they will build something uh that can be used as a place of worship and there are those ministers who say if they do God would never allow them to offer animals again I can't say that I don't know what God will allow if his word doesn't tell us then we don't know there are indications that they might but I can tell you this it doesn't matter how many bulls they should offer or how many lambs they would offer the blood of the Bulls and the goats and the Lambs would never be able to do for anybody Jew or Gentile what the blood of Yeshua the crucified Lamb of God has accomplished it would just be a continuous over and over of the off offerings offered over and over sacrifices offered and ordinances kept but you and I who are a part of the one new man we recognize that God himself has established a Reformation a new order of worship it has been rectified that word rectified means to set right to correct to make it as right as possible and that is certainly what the blood has done it has not covered our sin because then if we get out from under the covering we're lost it has totally rectified our error it has set us free from our debt if you believe that you can say Amen all right now verse 11 but Christ being come and high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made this is such a blessing not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his on blood he entered in to the holy Place having obtained once having obtained Eternal Redemption for us for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctify sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh look at verse 14. how much more how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit father Abba Papa offered himself without spot without blemish without a dark hair no disqualifying feature whatsoever fulfilling every requirement offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God now when we when we get in our mind that we do works we we go through uh disciplines or we carry out certain behaviors so that we can please God when we get caught up in that mindset it can it can make us feel okay it can make us feel temporarily Justified but at the end our conscience is there to get us and we can come under that that Holy strain of have I asked for forgiveness for everything is there something I missed is there some restitution that I failed to make when I came to the Lord that I need to get rid of and so God because he designed worship this way he designed the ordinances of the Tabernacle and the temple this way he wanted to offer something that would not only give you a temporary fulfillment or a temporary peace that made you feel like I am accepted but God wanted to give us something that would would cleanse and Purge our conscience that would cause us to never have to live in guilt or in condemnation again all we had to do was repent and we repent and we repent when we come to know that we have failed the Lord we repent when we come to know that we have failed the Lord we repent and we don't have to deal with the dirty conscience we don't have to deal with the condemning conscience we just keep pressing toward what God has called us to I'm calling your attention this way and uh he goes on here for just a moment how much more let's get it again how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God verse 15 and for this cause he Christ is the mediator of the New Testament praise God the newer Covenant that by means of death for the Redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called Hallelujah are you the cult have you been called to serve the Lord that's one of the most valuable things that could happen to anybody they which are called might receive the promise of Eternal inheritance not just the promise but the Fulfillment of the promise that we might live with him in peace throughout all eternity verse 16 for where a testament is that's a covenant a contract there must also of necessity be the death of the testator you look at it like an Earthly will when someone leaves a will it's not really called just a will it's called the last Testament it's the will and the last Testament of someone and that Testament it may promise the world but you don't get the world until the testator dies how many of you are thankful that everything that he put in the will everything he wrote in the last Testament is ours Hallelujah and he got it for us he not only promised it to us but he got it for us because he went all the way to Calvary he paid the price with his own blood for a testament is a force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth let's let brother Branham say it let's look at the message the future home paragraph 145 wait on me cheaters here you know you become a new person say new person why because the high priest went in behind the veil he fulfilled the day of atonement requirement he fulfilled the requirement of Yom Kippur you become a new person amen not just an old one patched up are you here by joining church or trying to turn a new page but you are a you read it that's what Christ has done that's what Christ has done for us now so don't come around here trying to sing I'm a sinner saved by grace no no you're not that man anymore you're not the sinner you're the one who has been saved by grace you're not a patched up representation of who you were you're a completely brand new unit why the blood the blood the blood the blood the blood Hallelujah not the blood of the bull not the blood of the Lamb not the blood of the turtle dove but the blood of Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah not just a patched up one God takes the old man and burns him completely out with the Holy Ghost and Fire did you know the Holy Ghost is part of the Salvation plan you've got to have the spirit of God in you burning out the old burning out the dross and preparing the the Tabernacle preparing the temple preparing the body so that God himself comes to live inside of the believer so let's read it in context God takes the old man and burns him completely out with the Holy Ghost and Fire and comes himself sins down your representation that is the seed of God coming to life in the heart of the believer let's go on no man can come to me except my father has drawn him now I don't know about you but I've known people who put off coming to the Lord what kind of a business is that I've heard people say things like when I'm old and I can't enjoy sinning then I'm going to come to the Lord in my old age and I'm going to serve him and be a Christian then when I'm when I'm nearing the river you know craziness crazy talk that comes as a product of a church entity that has taught people you just come whenever you're ready whenever you're ready you can come and the Lord will be standing there without stressed arms you know that's not even what the Bible teaches us it's not even scriptural to believe that you get to choose the time of your new birth all right what makes us think that we can choose the day and hour of our new birth it's not our place it's his place so when he draws you you better come to him when God starts dealing with you about your Reckless life you better come to him now you know I know people that they want to come closer to the Lord when things are going bad in their life and then they're going with him a while until things straighten out in their life then they turn loose of the Lord and they go back into their way of living that they had before that's not a born-again experience you just got a little bit of religion on you you didn't have a new creature a new creation a new creature experience the Holy Ghost in fire didn't come and cleanse you so you turn around and go back to the weekend beggarly elements of addiction in this old life if you have been born again there is no going back we don't even fully believe in the concept of backsliding because we believe you may break your fellowship but your relationship Remains the Same you may have to work on fellowshipping with him again and communing with him again but because you you fall away or because you make some bad choices we don't believe that you're divorced because of that we don't believe that God loses you because of that we believe that he has paid the price once and for all he never has to die for us again come on this isn't joining the church this isn't joining some denomination or putting your name on a book or getting a letter transferred this is a spiritual experience where the old man dies at a representation of God replaces that old man are you following me no man can come to me except my father drawed him so my point is you here this morning and you streaming the service if if the Lord is dealing with you about your life come to him don't put it off come while you can he is not obligated to draw you again he will sometimes he has sometimes is there anybody here glad of that but he is not obligated to you better come when he draws you all the father hath given me will come to me you see it same plan same way paragraph 146 Satan will be taken from the earth just exactly like Satan was taken from you Satan cannot bother or he can tempt but he cannot get a born-again Christian praise God he tempts anybody testify he tempts but he cannot get a born-again again Christian for God from the foundation of the world foresaw him and sent Jesus to redeem him and I love this next sentence I'm going to let you read it and the that's what we sang here Tuesday night let the blood of Calvary speak for me let it write me down is righteous where no righteousness has been let the blood do the talking on my behalf because the blood is a perfect and complete restitution for sin hallelujah how can he sin when it can't be seen even by God he don't even the only thing he hears is your voice he sees your representation amen that is true see what is brother random telling us he's telling us God sees your lamb he sees your blood offering and it was not one you concocted on your own it's one that God transacted on your behalf he became the transaction in the first seal paragraph 80. every Born Again believer True Believer is perfectly absolutely sinless before God he is not trusting his works in the blood of Jesus that his confession has dropped into see you're not pleading your case based on your your week of uh uh of you know interactions you you may have made some bad messes this week I could ask for hands you you may have failed the Lord in some big ways this week you may have found yourself on a on a rabbit trail of thoughts that were leading you away from faith and if any of that is is right if I'm describing your weak you just repent you just come to the Lord and say Lord have mercy on me help me I Repent of of my shortcoming my failure and my unbelief that blood of Jesus has come and our confession has dropped out of our works and it has dropped into the blood that speaks on our behalf brother Branham goes on to say the Bible says so see he that is born of God does not commit sin for he cannot sin that's the scripture this is not some strange doctrine of William random this is what the scripture said how can you make a man a sinner when the bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ is between him and God now if you see any of this as a license to sin you have no revelation of the truth I don't even know what to say about you you don't understand what we're talking about there is no license to sin no true child of God says before they commit an attribute of sin no true child of God says well I know the blood will be speaking for me anyway so I'll go and do what I want to do and then no real child of God has that kind of a conversation in their head I'm being honest with you if you do something is missing something is missing but what we find out is if we realize that we have yielded our heart if we have yielded our thoughts if we have yielded our members to sin we recognize our condition we repent we call on the name of the Lord he covers us hallelujah once and for all he said can you make a uh how can you make a man a sinner when the bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ is between him and God he said that would scatter sin Till There be nothing left of it see how can that pure blood of Christ ever let a sin pass there what do you say he cannot one more paragraph 81 Jesus said be you therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect and how could we even start the thought of being perfect we couldn't no surely you don't think your first thought about yourself is not that I'm perfect it'd be like the song you know I I uh I'll think of in a minute it's hard to be humble the old country song it's hard to be humble when you're perfect in every way can't wait to look in the mirror cause I get better looking each day to know me is to love me I must be a of a man it's hard to be humble when you're doing the best but I'm doing the best that I can now you know that's an old song that better not be your mantra for life I know some of you I can just hear you sing unto yourself in the mirror oh lord it's hard to be humble but no real child of God says I'm just perfect in every way I'm just so perfect my my if everybody could be like me you you should have heard the conversation in my office this morning about two pap paps you if you if you when was it was it one last Sunday was it last Sunday Sunday was a few weeks ago I had just been with with Zeke uh Ezekiel talking to him he'd been around me and in the process of of me getting my things I got my things I came out I got in the vehicle and I stopped my vehicle out on the volleyball court as Ezekiel is walking across there he now saw me where he left he now sees me where I am now and he didn't see me get there he said what two paps he's been recently asking his parents to see two pep peps again [Music] so we had quite a discussion in the in the office and I could get a whole lot done if there were two paps think about it one go one way and one go the other but David that only David so preciously graciously unnecessarily pointed out but he said I bet you'd have a hard time getting along with him [Music] that's his one joke wonder he's a real comedian now ain't it the truth we want everybody to be just like us this is kind of how we feel we're not saying it but it's kind of how we feel sometimes I want you to process life like I do and then if that were to happen we wouldn't be able to get along with that that one would we we're different we're fearfully wonderfully made nobody walks around thinking I'm perfect but the reality is we are made perfect not by our works not by a woman's long hair not by a man uh addressing a certain way or doing a certain thing or refraining from a certain thing it's by the blood of Jesus Christ we live the life we live not to buy our Salvation we live the life we live to testify of our Salvation amen sisters choose to dress different walk different live different not because they believe that that's what saves them they do that to testify to the world I'm different I've come through the blood of Jesus Christ it's it's what causes people to come and say where do you go to church do you ever think when you're out in the public you see a woman in a pair of short shorts a bleached out hair and a clown makeup on because that's what they do anymore it's it's it's if there ever was a time it was tasteful it's not tasteful now it's the most exaggerated thing a woman is not satisfied with her own eyelashes so she buys spiders to put on there you can spot it across the store see her desire is not to look natural if her desire was to look natural natural she might do something to try to thicken her own but because she'd rather look like some kind of freak of nature she goes out and gets something so that everyone who sees her can know she's glued them on nobody looks at her and think oh my does she ever have thick eyelashes they don't even think that they think wonder how much she paid for them they know they're not her so the world has gone so far insane if you were to see I'm not trying to be ugly I couldn't really get to the nitty-gritty now if I need to but if you saw a woman like that she's sucking on her last draw of a cigarette getting ready to put it out on the ground which is just sickening to me and uh I got tennis shoes sometime that they've got big cleats on them and they'll pick up one of them old things in a parking lot and walk around and it just makes me want to I tell you what it makes me want to do it makes me want to force somebody to eat them things that's what I'd like to do sometime that you throw them down for somebody else to step on now if you saw a woman like that who in this room would think to go over to her and say I really am looking for a church where do you go to church nobody's ever asked that woman where she has gone to church so that they could join her church even the old crazy world we live in if that woman as they are they look for somebody who looks like they're different than the rest it's not just in the clothes it's also in the countenance but I've never seen a woman like that with the Holy countenance so you're not going to be drawn to some somebody dressing like that or carrying on like that some man in a in a wife beater shirt on you know they call them you're going to go over and ask him his old hairy armpits uh hanging out of his tank top and old beer belly hanging over his short britches belly button shining out flip-flops on hello are you gonna go over there and ask that man where he goes to church so you can try out his church I know where his church is it's the first church of the living room sits in front of the idiot box day and night come on I don't want what he has I I want to find somebody that has gotten a hold of something that is not a keeping of a rule or a regulation but they have decided I mean they have decided I Surrender oh I don't have to be like the other fish I don't have to live like the other fish I choose to go the other way the way that says back to Calvary the way that says I am not my own I've been bought with a prize be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect and how could we even start the thought of being perfect but Jesus required it I've told you so many times before that everything he requires he provides what a God won't you serve him what a God he's not asking you to do something more than than what you're able to do everything he requires he provides everything he asked of us he gives us Grace to be able to pay it back give it back brother Bantam said and if Jesus required it he has got to make a way for it and he has and he has his own blood if you believe that same man let's read on just a little bit Hebrews 9 18 now whereupon neither the first testament we're talking about the older Covenant we're talking about the law was dedicated without blood for when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats with water and Scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book the record of the law and all the people this is describing the the uh red heifer the offering that was given uh I saw a great picture I wished I would have brought it uh a great picture of of the bridge that once connected the Mount of Olives with the Temple mount uh I wonder if I could just take just a moment we're just kind of a in in teaching mood oh my can I just share this with you Mary Beth just wrote and said I wanted to tell you that I had open wazee's iPad to put on worship music on Friday and she was writing a message on messenger and it said I want to praise the Lord that all is well she didn't get it posted but that was the confession that she was going to make on that service and in the midst of all she was going through on Friday she asked her family she said did you get to tell I think she asked Sister Williams did you get to tell brother Shelley how much I enjoyed that message did you get to tell him so that is so precious I'm glad I opened that up uh give me just a minute and let me send this that's not it thank you for helping me charity where do I send this to Hulk where do I send this to say who are we close enough yep there you are oh sorry that goes into text can somebody help me do that you got it can you but how are you going to get it up there come on praise God now that is a great picture it was there I've seen some of the ruins you see the temple over there at the end of the bridge see the fire coming up there out the this is an altar that was built on the Mount of Olives we're we're right about close to where the seven arches Hotel would be in modern day or maybe somewhere right about the uh Dominus flevitt or the Church of the Ascension and they built a bridge all the way across so that the red heifer could be see he's got the the hyssop in his hand the priest there on top of the altar do you see that and the and the Scarlet threads there hanging down from his hand and he's going to offer that and then the ashes will be walked across the bridge of that Valley there uh there's two valleys one is the valley of hinom and and the other one is what say it Kidron Valley yes this would be Kidron across that Valley there he walks in with the ashes of that red heifer so anyone who ever wondered exactly what that would look like now the bridge is gone the altar is gone and the temple is gone but once upon a time look I wonder how many years and how much effort it took that Valley is very very deep some of you have uh Hawken Chad and others have stood with me up on the Promenade looking down over on the old city you know how deep that thing is Sultan's pool down there on the other side and the uh tomb of Absalom down in the bottom of that Valley there and the Jewish Graves have been there for so many years the Tombstones are sliding off the mountain down into the valley I don't know how long it would have taken him to build such a bridge as that but I'm telling you it would have I don't know the dimensions but it would have been a real feat why would they go to such a trouble because it was the only way they knew to cry out to God for their life they were working their way to righteousness and God designed it that way but you know the next day some of these that worshiped today sang the Psalms sang praises to God watched with such holy reverence as the priest was walking those ashes of the red heifer back over to the temple to offer them there unto the Lord the next day their conscious was smiting them again once that day of atonement Yom Kippur was finished it would only be a matter of time that something would happen in somebody's life and their conscience would be smiting them again and they would be worrying again and they would be down buying a dove to take to the priest for a daily trespass offering we've got to make sure we keep God to peace you see some of the early Jews had this concept of God because of all the pagan gods that he was a bloodthirsty God and the only way to appease him was to keep offering him more blood and more blood and more blood and just like their Fanatics today there were always fanatics and these Fanatics would would try to do whatever some even stealing and cheating to get the money to buy a sacrifice so they could every day offer something and Jesus said this will never get people to God Jesus said this will never finish what we have started but he had a plan in his mind way before the first was established but the first was taken away to make room for the New Order the Tabernacle had to be brought down the temple had to be brought down so that a new order could be could be offered so in verse 19 it describes these different uh elements that were used verse 20 saying this is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you moreover he sprinkled with blood both the Tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry now in verse 22 and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood it's no remission it was therefore necessary that the pattern of things in the heavens should be purified with these but the Heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these he's talking to us about the very idea for the Tabernacle was a vision of how things are in the heavenlies and it was by instruction that Moses and the Craftsmen that were chosen to help Moses they were able to duplicate the Heavenly Sanctuary on the earth to build things as much as they possibly could to look like what it was in heaven what a task and in doing so that which was placed on the earth it had to be perched and Sanctified with blood it was not holy in itself the things in heaven were holy of themselves the things that were duplicated in the earth were were not holy within themselves they had to be purified Sanctified set apart by the sprinkling of blood this is what Paul is telling us even the holy Ark even the holy Furniture had to be Sanctified and set apart by Blood God knew exactly what he was doing it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these but the Heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these for Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself Paul wants you to know that Jesus didn't come and physically go through the temple and put his blood there he didn't have to do that that was just the Earthly Shadow he went into the heavenlies how many of you know he went into the head don't touch me I've not yet ascended to my father he had to go into the heavenlies and he offered his blood on the altars of Heaven he offered his blood in the Holy Sanctuary which was the Heavenly reality of what the Earth was only a type and a shadow and a model so I want you to know what a beautiful thing can you imagine how Heaven must have stood in awe as Messiah steps back in where was his Earthly body his Earthly body was laying in a grave he has now blessed be the name of the Lord he has not entered in with his Earthly body he's entered in with another kind of body altogether and these are the figures of the truth but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God don't miss those last two words for us look at thou knowest all things and we don't have to be here so late but I want to get a little more of this in now we know drinking and carrying on his sin do you know that do you understand that this kind of behavior is is wrong he said but the whole thing is because of unbelief it's not because of the drinking it's because of the unbelief you you need to understand that if you really believe that God had made a way for you to have a better life you'd step away from those things that give you a rotten life and you'd come to him to try to find the better life that's promised by the blood for we know drinking and carrying on his sin but the whole thing is because of unbelief because if you believe God in Jesus Christ to be a son you are absolutely not going to do those things so the fact that we continue to do those things testifies that we don't really believe in Jesus we don't really believe that his blood is enough to redeem us it's it's pretty serious transaction here you're absolutely not going to do those things you believe that he that's born of God does not commit sin see all right You Must Believe the whole thing Lays Jesus said he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has shall not come into condemnation but already passed from death into life you believe that too he said you believe that's the truth there it lays there isn't any there there isn't nothing else that you can do only believe and if you believe then them little immoral things will just drop off like that if they linger the problem is is the belief it's the faith it's putting the faith in and how often do we have to put our faith in the word all the time somebody say every day all the time every time the devil talks and he talks pretty often doesn't he and you believe you become love as you believe you become love and love is God and you begin to wind yourself into Christ and these other things you you don't have to we're going on you don't have to quit doing them they just quit themselves brother random says they drop off and I truly believe that I do know that there are people who deal with lingering issues and need further Deliverance but I believe what the word said all things pass away he said there's just no desire to do it that's why the old-timers who really believed in a full Deliverance at Salvation that's why the old-timers would testify I drink all the alcohol I want to drink but when I got saved I didn't want to anymore the desire was gone I don't want that anymore I don't desire that anymore he said there's just no desire to do it the worshiper having purged has no more conscience of sin our desire of sin and he refers us back to Hebrews 9 right where we're reading see the worshiper wants purged now that actual phrase appears in Hebrews 10 the first three verses he said see what I mean when the worshiper is purged it's when he is born again when his old nature dies and a new nature sets in then he becomes a part of God a Son of God brother Vanna means in actuation in reality in that moment in reality he's now part of God you also know that you came here with the representation of God as a seed he said he gets a new life and the Greek word there is Zoe which means what's it mean and you become an offspring wow I am a child of God I am an offspring of God okay now I don't know if you can do it together but see if you can read the rest of that and God can't see what I mean God can't hurt you without hurting himself the church has caused us to believe that God is just waiting on you to make a mistake so he can smack you over the head that's not the god of the Bible he would go to any length he would go to any measure he would do anything in his power and he's all-powerful to keep you from going back into those things he would rather preserve you he would rather sanctify you and set you apart can't just hurt you beat you judge you smite you in order to do that he would be smiting himself it takes a revelation to be able to see something like this can we read a couple more verses 25 through 27. nor yet that he should offer him himself often as the high priest enter at the end of the Holy place every year with blood of others for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the and as it is appointed unto men wants to die but after this the Judgment so Christ once offered to Bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation so Christ was once offered to Bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation and that completes the the ninth chapter of the book of Hebrews now maybe Tuesday night the Lord willing we can do something with Hebrews chapter 10. uh I want to move into something else before we close I want to remind you of a few things concerning this day of atonement uh someone come and get a microphone uh Elias come and get that microphone right there if you will dear brother and and turn it on if you don't have and and I'm going to get you to read some verses for me there's a lot of reading here and I'm going to save myself uh in Luke in in Leviticus chapter 16. we still have a little time here it's 1 14 for every clock watcher I'm going to have Elias to read a few of these verses because if any of you are interested in the day of atonement [Music] beginning at sundown this evening I want you to understand a little bit here and I may stop you but I want you to understand a little bit of what the priest had to go through in making preparation for for this uh I mean once a year and they believe that the congregational sins the sins of the congregation as a whole were forgiven for one one year because of what the priest did on the day of atonement however because they still had a sin conscience because they still had this guilty conscience then they would still continue to offer all these other offerings going way overboard spending way too much money just to try to make their own selves feel good about their life Jesus had to come and he had to stop this cycle can you imagine he had to do it as horrible as the destruction of the temple is God himself stood back and allowed man to destroy the temple because they could not embrace the New Order he had to show them that I had to take away the old so that you would begin to even try to see the new isn't that just like us hello that's why we couldn't just come to this message and sit in our denominational Church God had to take us out of the old or we'd never be able to embrace the fullness of the new you'd get a mixed meal every time you come together you you don't want a mixed meal you want to know what you're eating don't you watch what you eat all right Elias beginning in verse 1 of Leviticus 16. and the Lord spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron when they offered before the Lord and died remember that is those who offered Strange Fire on the altar of the Lord read on and the Lord said unto Moses speak unto Aaron thy brother that he come not at all times into the holy place within the veil before the mercy seat which is upon the ark that he died not for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seats all right remember Aaron as the first high priest read on thus shall Aaron come into the holy place with a young Bullock for a sin offering and a RAM for a burnt all right this is for getting ready for Yom Kippur for the day of atonement so Aaron is not to come in and out as the high priest at his will he can only come into the holy Place once a year and he comes in with the offering uh of a young Bullock and a ram a RAM for a burnt offering and a young bull a calf for a sin offering all right read on he shall he shall put on the holy linen coat and he shall have the linen breaches upon his flesh and shall be girded with a linen girdle and with the linen miter shell he be attired These Are Holy garments therefore shall he wash his flesh and water and so put them on all right and he shall and he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering and one RAM for a burnt offering now here is a continuation now after he has changed his clothes he has now put on the holy ifod the underneath it's the working garment it's not the Royal garment with the breastplate he's taken that off he now puts on the working garment and uh I I might just say here that uh uh he was given the requirement of wearing these linen breeches and they were to be underneath his robe because the the the the working Garment of the ephod did not come all the way down and the Bible said that he was to be careful when he went up on the altar that he did not expose the nakedness of his thigh now he was in a holy Place wasn't he so he had to be careful how he went in all right go on and Aaron shall offer his Bullock of the sin offering which is for himself and make an atonement for himself and for his house so this particular part of the offering the Bullock for the sin offering was to cover himself and his house okay go ahead and he shall take the two goats and present them before the Lord at the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation here are the two goats and Aaron shall cast lots upon the Two Goats one lot for the Lord and the other lots for the scapegoat and Aaron shall bring the goats upon which the Lord's lot fell and offer him for a sin offering now there was a golden vessel in this golden vessel were two lots two little tokens on one token it said for Adonai for the Lord on the other token it said and that was for the scapegoat one is for the Lord one is the scapegoat all right go ahead and read but the goats on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat shall be presented alive before the Lord he would take those lots one for the Lord one for the scapegoat shake them in the vessel reach in blindly and lay those tokens on the head of these two goats and in that moment the Lord was choosing not the high priest the Lord was directing the Lots this is what they believed I do too that the Lord was directing the lot and one of the Lots is held on one head one is held on the other one becomes the sacrifice and one becomes the scapegoat that is released into the Wilderness read on the make an atonements with him to let him go for a scapegoat Into the Wilderness so one dice of the people of the freedom of the people read on and Aaron shall bring the Bullock of the sin offering which is for himself and shall make an atonement for himself and for his house and shall kill the Bullock of the sin offering which is for himself read on and he shall take a sensor full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the Lord so now he takes the sensor with a vessel that is shaped in such a way that it can hold hot coals and incense drop down on those hot coals with holes in this uh vessel so that the smoke and the fragrance could be released remember the high priest even though he had blood he could not go into the holy of holies unless he first filled that area with this fragrance of the Holy incense remember that Holy incense is representative of the prayers and the worship of the Saints so prayer had to proceed and worship had to precede the blood interesting isn't it that's why prayer and worship precedes the delivery of the word it creates when you say when you hear us say we're creating an atmosphere we're filling up the spiritual atmosphere with prayer and worship just like the holy incense and the and the smoke of the Holy incense before he would go in read on I know there's a lot of reading but I like it in his hands full of sweet incest beaten small and bring it within the veil alright go ahead and he shall put the incense upon the fire before the Lord that the cloud of the incense May cover the mercy seats that is upon the testimony that he died listen at what the penalty is if he doesn't create the right atmosphere before offering the blood he dies so I don't I don't think I I don't quite understand how we could come to a day in the message of the hour where we would minimalize the importance of praise and worship in preparing the atmosphere for the word to come forth it can't even be born in your heart in the wrong atmosphere did you know you hear the word it'll fall right off of you in the wrong atmosphere it only attaches itself in the right atmosphere and this is all shown to us in the example here of of the day of atonement read on uh Elias you're doing a great job and he shall take of the blood of the Bullock and sprinkle it with his finger upon The Mercy Seat Eastward and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his fingers seven times he dips his finger into the blood he stands before the mercy seat which is the Ark of the Covenant the lid of the Ark of the Covenant and he sprinkles the blood with his fingers like strowing the blood with his finger seven times all of this the day of atonement go ahead then shall he kill the goats of the sin offering that is for the people and bring his blood within the veil he's moving in and out and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the Bullock and sprinkle it upon the mercy seats and before the mercy all right go ahead and he shall make an atonement that's the holy place that word atonement is Kapoor it is it means uh the atoning sacrifice and that's where we get the the name Yom Kippur or the day of atonement it's the same word for the holy Place read on because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel and because of their transgressions in all their sin and so shall he do for the Tabernacle of the congregation that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness let's go come on and there shall be no man in the Tabernacle of the congregation when he goes into make an atonement in the Holy place until he come out and have made an atonement for himself and for his household and for all the congregation of Israel so even in the Holy place which is outside the most holy that outer Court are always sacrifices and offerings being offered the priests remember the the the uh altar that was in the temple was so large that men climbed up on it we just mentioned that there were ramps that led up onto the altar we're talking about a huge thing we're talking about something uh like a half of this this Sanctuary being the altar we're not talking about little altars like in the Tabernacle and so it's very interesting that that whole area where there's constant busyness remember there's a fire on the corner of that altar that God himself lit and it was up to the priest to make sure that it never went out all these other implements the labor and all the different things for washing there's always somebody moving in and out but not on the day of atonement the whole Outer court is cleared no one is there until Aaron goes in as the high priest and carries out the various ordinances offerings and sacrifices that are being mentioned here read on and there shall be no and he shall he didn't finish this but let him finish this one and there shall be no man in the Tabernacle of the congregation when he goes in to make an atonement in the Holy place until he come out and have made an atonement for himself and for his household and the congregation right Israel go ahead and he shall go out unto the altar that is before the Lord and make an atonement for it for it shall take of the blood of the Bullock and of the blood of the goats and put it upon the horns of the altar roundabout now he's already gone into the holy of holies he's already sprinkled the blood twice he's now coming out and look what he's doing he's sanctifying the altar he's taking the blood of the Bullock and the blood of the goat and putting it on the four horns the four corners of the offering excuse me of the altar round about all of this the day of atonement read on and he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his fingers seven times and cleanse it and hallowed before the uncleanness of the church and hallowed from the uncleanness of the children of Israel they're constantly coming in and out offering these offerings for sin and trespass and now on this day not only is the blood placed on the Ark of the Covenant but even the altar is re-sanctified and re-cleansed in the presence of God read on and when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place and the Tabernacle of the congregation and the altar he shall bring the live goat the scapegoat the live goat and Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel and all their transgressions and all their sins putting them upon the head of the goats and shall send him away by The Land by the hand Into the Wilderness now this was like a ceremony taking place the priest crosses his hands lays them on the head of the scapegoat he begins to confess the sins of Israel in a corporate manner you don't think he stood there for days do you calling out every sin of every person he does it in a corporate Manner and this was a symbol of the transference of sin onto the offering the New Testament tells us that this is what happened to Christ he who knew no sin was made sin he became sin on our behalf all of the sins of the world were transferred unto Christ though he knew no sin and when he died on the cross he died there for the sins of the whole world yet he knew no sin of his own this is the it's the type this is the type of that this is where the whole concept comes from the sins are being transferred spiritually onto the head of the scapegoat and he shall be sent Away by the hand of a fit man Into the Wilderness all right read on and the Goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited and he shall let go the goats in the wilderness and Aaron shall come into the Tabernacle of the congregation and shall put off the linen garments which he put on when he went into the holy place and shall leave them there he's changing clothes again all on the day of atonement the working robe of the priest the ifod of the priests for working is now taken off and he's about to change garments all over again read on and he shall wash his flesh with water in the Holy place and put on his garments and come forth and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offerings of the people and make an atonement for himself and for the people and the fat and the fats of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar and he that Let Go the goats for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes and bathe his flesh and water and afterward come into the camp redone and the Bullock for the sin offering and the goats for the sin offering whose blood was brought in make atonements in the Holy Place shall one carry forth without the camp and they shall burn in the fire of their skins and their flesh and their dung okay do you remember that bridge the picture of the bridge now on the day of atonement the priest comes back across that bridge to to put these things out they cannot remain in the camp remember what Hebrews tells us that Jesus suffered where without the camp this is the type of bat they had to take all that out and put it on the other side can you can you go back and let me see that uh I needed the verse I'm sorry but but but you see the bridge uh there it is shall one carry forth and the bullet for the sin offering the goal for the sin offering whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the Holy Place shall one carry forth without the camp and they shall burn in the fire their skins their flesh and their dung now the priest goes back across that bridge steps down off of that Altar and that is where these things were were placed and he it could not remain in in that Sanctified area and this is so beautiful because it talks about Christ who suffered without the camp now I might tell you that there are many archaeologists quite a few who believe that there is a great possibility that instead of the Golgotha that we know today where what we know is Gordon's Calvary today there are many who study many archaeologists who believe that in order for the death of Christ to fulfill all of these things that the cross actually had to appear on the Mount of Olives he had to suffer without the camp and that would have required him to be outside the walls of the old city and we know that there was a time that calvary or Golgotha today was actually inside the walls of the old city and so there are many people who believe that the cross itself was erected in the very area where the red heifer ashes were placed and the offering of the red heifer took place every year I don't know what to say about that except that God is a meticulous God nothing surprises me when it fulfilled every little detail coming together and fulfilling so that all can be taken away and the new to come forth read on just a few more minutes it's 1 30. and he that burneth them shall wash his clothes and bathe his flesh and water and afterward he shall come into the camp and this shall be a statute forever unto you that in the seventh month on the tenth day of the month you shall afflict your souls and do no work at all whether it be one of your own country or a stranger that sojourneth among you all right for on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you to cleanse you that you meet that ye may be clean from all your sins before the Lord read on it shall be a Sabbath of rest unto you and ye shall afflict your souls by a statute forever and the priest whom he shall anoint and whom he shall consecrates to minister in the priest's office in his father's stead this is the replacing of the high priest shall make the atonements and shall put on the linen clothes even the holy garments and he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary and he shall make an atonement for the Tabernacle of the congregation and for the altar he shall make an atonement for the priests and for all the people of the congregation amen read on and this shall be an everlasting statute unto you to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year and he did as the Lord commanded Moses now when you when you read this and you hear it talking about an Everlasting Covenant and a statue that is Everlasting does that say to you that it should never be mentioned in the new in the New Order or the New Covenant or does it say to you that even though we know there has been a fulfillment of these things because we have an Everlasting Covenant we should remember these things we should rehearse these things we should understand these things so I want you to know that's why we're talking about that's why we mark it on the calendar we're doing it because God made it an Everlasting Covenant and we believe according to to the prophet Ezekiel and to others Zechariah we believe that some form of these elements will be celebrated in the millennium something will take place to commemorate in fact there's indication that the Nations will will come up to Jerusalem to bring their offerings unto the to the Lord who sits in the Holy Temple remember and we don't know exactly what this will look like but if the church totally ignores the type and the shadow how can they fully understand the reality and the Fulfillment and how can we be faithful to the word if we don't even mention those things no wonder brother banham tells us that we watch Israel and we watch Jerusalem and we understand that they are God's timepiece it helps us to remember where we are now just a few more minutes I want to read you something that that is just pretty incredible are you listening inherits Temple early at dawn the priest escorted the hot the priests escorted the high priest to the bath house where he washed his hands and feet ten times dressed in his golden robe of Exodus 28 that is the the Royal robe of the priest it has it has the ephod it has the shoulder pieces it has the breastplate I mean it is a it is a uh I wonder if you could find some some example that you could just show us to remind us I might can send you one it would take me a minute to do so we're not going to ask you to to fast for 25 hours but what we are going to ask you to do is be patient this morning while we remember these things let me see I've got several here I'm going to send this one to you charity the same way because my airdrop didn't seem to be picking up from there this may not be the best one but it's one you can look at Hallelujah did it come through okay that's all I know you're working on it that's fine just want to make sure you got it from me this gives you a little bit of an idea this shows the turban and the crown the Onyx stones that are on the shoulder pieces the the linen tunic underneath all right there we go I want you to look at this fellow you see the the shoulder see the chains that come down from the black onyx on his shoulder pads uh pieces it comes down there there's a blue robe that goes over the top of the linen tunic then then connected to the shoulder pieces are the uh is the breastplate where the where the urum and the thamim are the urim and thumim are two meme and the 12 Stones are on the outside behind that little behind that little pocket is where the urim and the thumim went behind those stones there's a little pocket coming down there that you could see that was inside then the 12 Stones are there the blue robe showing us down on the bottoms of the blue robe there golden bells and pomegranates underneath he has linen pants so that he is covered all the way down and this is just a close-up of the crown that goes on top of the and what did it say on the crown remember holy unto the Lord so this gives you a little bit of an idea what he looked like just leave that up if you want to and let me finish reading he's washed his hands and feet ten times dressed in his golden robes he offered the morning sacrifice with his miter which is the is the tune the top of the the white part that you see behind the crown with this miter and Golden Crown and on his head that was inscribed Holiness under the Lord stones on his breast and golden Bells hanging from the rich purple robe back to the bath house he goes where he washed and dressed in spotless white linen he then approached the young bull placed his hands on its head and said I beseech the Lord I have sinned I and my household have transgressed against thee then he moves to the Two Goats which were Tethered on the east side of the altar he reached into the urn and shuffled the two golden tablets to be drawn as lots to determine which goat was to be the sacrifice and which was to be the scapegoat sorry about that give me just a moment the people believed that it was a good sign if the tablet marked for the Lord was drawn out by the priest's right hand but from 80 30 till the destruction of the temple in ad70 and for those 40 years only this is recorded in the mishnah and in talmud for 40 years only the high priest when he reached in with his right hand instead of pulling out for the Lord which was to be a good sign he pulled out for Azazel the scapegoat the priest would fall on their faces and pray for their Temple and their people they knew that it was an omen what what the what we would call an omen you say well I don't believe in that well they knew that God deals by signs and wonders and for 40 years it was not for the Lord in the right hand it was for the scapegoat the tablets were then placed on the heads of the goats sealing their Fates the Hebrew word for scapegoat is Azazel as a sale was seen as a type of Satan the sins of the people and thus the punishment of the people were laid upon Azazel the scapegoat he would bear the sins of the people and the punishment of the people would be upon him as Azale being sent in the wilderness is understood to be a picture of a final judgment and the Enemy being Cast Away forever as the sacrificial goat was led away the high priest would tie this is important to hear as the sacrificial goat was led away the high priest would tie a red sash on the horns of the scapegoat he could not be driven away until after the blood was shed the priests then returned to the bull prayed over him again killed the animal the blood was caught in a basin by another priest while the high priest poured hands of incense into a gold in a golden ladle with the ladle in one hand he picked up the golden fire pan with hot coals and entered into the holy of holies he then placed the coals on the foundation stone and poured the incense over them the foundation stone was that that the Ark of the Covenant sat on as the holy of holies filled with smoke he stepped out prayed again and took the Basin of blood from the priest that had been stirring it the entire time why to keep it from coagulation and again he entered into the holy of holies this time to sprinkle the blood on the altar how many times seven times he then stepped out again killed the sacrificial goat collected the blood entered into the holy of holies for a third and final time now if the mishna is right there were many years that this was done in the temple supernaturally there was no witness and there remember there was someone who had been standing there stirring that blood there was no witness that ever saw them going under the veil for many years it was believed that God somehow supernaturally took the high priest behind the veil and brought him out to continue on his work do you struggle to believe something like that I don't not in the least afterward a special handle took the Crimson sash from the scapegoat's horns excuse me a special Handler took the Crimson sash from the scapegoats horns tore it into and tied half of it back on the horns of the scapegoat does anybody remember where the other part went as the people chanted hurry up and go hurry up and go hurry up and go the condemned animal was led through a gate of the Temple and escorted with his Handler by different individuals in a relay do you understand a Handler would send the gold escorting the next person who would take it and escort him to the next Handler when they reached the appointed place which was a cliff about 10 miles outside the city the goat Handler would drive the goat off the cliff and into the Ravine below the runners would then run back quickly to the temple to bring the news later the bodies of the gold and the bull are burned and we talked about that the priests would have to go back over a cross now here is something interesting recorded in the mishnah according to the mission of the other portion of the sash was attached to the door of the temple so the red sash torn into it had previously been tied to the goat's horns torn into half of that sash now tied back on the goat's horns half of it tied to the doorway of the Temple had to happen before the goat was driven into the Wilderness the sash is noted to have eventually turned from red to White signalized signaling that the goat driven into the Wilderness had met its end and that God had accepted the sin offering of the people and their sins were therefore forgiven that'd be a pretty powerful sign to watch the the red sash to turn white again the mishnah says that for 40 years before the destruction of the Temple the sash stopped turning white can you imagine the grief that the Jewish people experienced when they realized that the goat had not died and had not been accepted as a perfect offering for the people 40 years before the destruction of the Temple when you start looking at that you would understand that's exactly the time that Jesus had died on Calvary it the minute that his blood was accepted of the father God said I'm going to show you I'm no longer accepting the blood of a scapegoat in that kind of interesting to note now I want to give you one last thing in closing I still uh we have the time we're making the time we're taking the time I want to show you something that brother Branham said can you find the quote there I think it was probably the only I've got my pages here so mixed up now it was toward the end of my notes yes now remember I told you that the Jewish people believe that the goat that was the scapegoat is also a type of of Satan the enemy because he was put into a place of of death or punishment this is something brother Branham says interesting about Christ and I love this because a spiritual eye can see Christ everywhere in the Bible this is what I found he was both I know you have that Brethren here believes that the devil was the scapegoat but no no no no no no what do you think he meant no Christ was he saw Christ in the one that gave his life and his blood was shed as an atonement for the people and brother Branham saw Christ in the one that was driven into the Wilderness he said both death and Resurrection you see he bore our sins away and then comes forth in the resurrection and so it was Christ being represented for the church musicians are coming took the church's place of sin and was cast into outer darkness in Hell remember he went down into the heart of the earth he went into hell and took the keys of death hell and the grave brother Branham sees that as he is going through hell to take those keys he sees that as a type of judgment on the body he said he took the church's place of sin cast into outer Darkness into hell and rose again the third day God raised him up what for our justification so here brother Branham was looking at the goat and the scapegoat it was of interest to him all of these things took place on the day of atonement now that was a busy busy few hours of time wasn't it I want you to play something Softly and I'm going to read one more thing to you Tuesday night will be too late it's already passed I want to read you an experience that the lord gave me in 2007. I've had several experiences with the Lord on the day of atonement I always take a few moments to see if he wants to meet with me on the day of atonement just prior to the day of atonement 2007. I think it was it was the evening that we we were going down to the beach for the day of atonement because Bob Jones had invited us to come and be with him on the day of atonement and Paul Keith Davis was hosting this Gathering where we spent the day of atonement in prayer all day long together I had gotten there that evening and gone out on the balcony when I had this experience so it was either the day before the day of atonement or two days before I saw myself as a high priest and never seen anything like this quite before I I was there but I was watching it I was being helped by other priests I experienced each detailed step as outlined in Leviticus 16. I washed in the labor I put on special garments the linen coat breeches Etc I Heard a Voice saying we must make preparation for coming into the holy I completely understood stand that Jesus Paid the price with his own blood and opened up the way for us to enter into the holy of holies however there is a Here and Now application and appropriation of what he did we must prepare I want you to hear this we must prepare for the greater glory I'm going to read it again I want your help we must prepare for the greater glory if Jesus has washed and Sanctified and set us apart where what is our responsibility there was grave danger in not making proper preparation before entering into the holy into the presence of the Shekinah Glory the penalty was death in this experience I clearly heard brother branham's voice loudly declaring what I had heard him say many times before fools will walk with hob-nailed boots Where Angels Fear to trod sometimes I feel concerned with the abundance of prophetic happenings being shared today in many circles the reason is the growing Trend to make what is Holy seem more common this has evolved from our desire to make the Supernatural and prophetic realm more accessible however in our impatience we have failed to discern between an experience initiated by the Lord in our spirit and one initiated by our imagination in the realm of our soul I don't think we realize just how dangerous our imagination can be throughout scripture the imagination is often referred to as something evil in man's heart it is also defined as a Graven image which is an idol in our desire to have Supernatural experiences are we choosing to circumvent God and what he has for us by creating things through vain imaginings and I go on I'm not going to read all of
