Description:
At the table of grace, the bride of every age will gather — not because of who we are, but because of what He’s done.
Every story different, yet the testimony the same: we made it by grace, through the blood of Jesus Christ.
Being born once gives us life on earth, but being born again opens the door to eternity.
Water, blood, and Spirit — the full work of the new birth.
It’s not just a filling; it’s an overflow of His life within us.
That’s what it means to be born from above.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
sitting at my dining room table again. Those tears of joy, sir, &gt;&gt; I couldn't stop them from rolling down my cheeks. And my sanctified imagination carried me to a place not so very far away where there will be a table where there is a table &gt;&gt; spread for a million miles long. This is symbolically it meaning that the bride of every age will sit down at that table and we'll be able to look at across at one another testifying to one another how we made it over. &gt;&gt; And you know our circumstances may be different but the way we made it over is all the same. We'll all say by grace. &gt;&gt; By grace through the blood of Jesus Christ. Church, if anybody in this house makes it all the way, you'll make it by grace. You'll make it by the blood. You won't make it because you know who brother Brandham is. You'll only make it if you know Jesus in an intimate and personal way. You must have your own experience with God. He has no grandchildren. &gt;&gt; You've got to know him in the power of his resurrection. You've got to exchange your earth birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your earth birth for a new birth. &gt;&gt; That word born again means born from above. &gt;&gt; You have had an earth birth. You have been birthed here in this realm. But I want you to know that doesn't qualify you for an eternal place around the table. &gt;&gt; But there is a birth. &gt;&gt; There is a birth that qualifies you for a perpetual place in that table uh uh in the marriage supper of the lamb. Not just for a thousand years of millennial reign, but forever a in an eternity that will never end. That's the birth from above. &gt;&gt; So Lord, may we all know today before we leave this place that we have not only had an earth, &gt;&gt; but that we have had a birth from above, &gt;&gt; totally born again. That means saved by grace through the blood. It means sanctified by applying the washing of the water of the word. And it means baptized, filled to overflowing. Come on. &gt;&gt; The difference between filled and baptized &gt;&gt; is you can fill up a cup &gt;&gt; and stop at the rim &gt;&gt; and you can say, "I fill the cup." That's the earnest. &gt;&gt; But there's something more. &gt;&gt; There there's that portion that that is added that causes the cup to overflow. This is a baptism &gt;&gt; and it's part of the new birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said salvation and the Holy Ghost baptism is not the same thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he said it requires the Holy Ghost baptism to complete &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The new birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. He goes on to say, "The Holy Ghost baptism and the new birth are not the same. &gt;&gt; But it requires a Holy Ghost baptism in order to complete the new birth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Water, blood, &gt;&gt; and then life. &gt;&gt; Spirit life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Completes the new birth.
