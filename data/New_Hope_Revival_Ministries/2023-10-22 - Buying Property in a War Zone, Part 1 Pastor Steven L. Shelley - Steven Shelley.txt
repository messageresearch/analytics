Sanctified by the washing of the water of the word filled with the walking talking holy ghost walking in the light of this day why we're blessed so yeah we get a little excited sometime rare occasion at least twice a week we get a little excited you know if every Church were just alike then the one Church would be full and all the other churches would be empty I I'm so glad that we can learn to be who we want to be who God created us to be and uh you can worship however you choose to worship as long as you know who you're worshiping what a relationship with him means so we're blessed today brother George Van Hutton we wish you a happy birthday streaming this service today from the Netherlands our our precious friend of over 30 years Sister Evelyn fox has a birthday today so we are sending her our love on Wednesday of this week uh here on Earth we remember the birthday of our sister Roy H I don't believe that I know I know that a lot of people think their birthdays in heaven and so forth but I I don't particularly believe that we celebrate birthdays in eternity since there's no time but we can continue to celebrate their life and their memory and what they mean to us and uh we certainly miss our sister and then on Friday of this week Josiah um has a birthday let's see how old are you going to be 28 that's still pretty young I have socks that are 28 years old so that's young and they're still good I still wear them so that's good uh I don't know that she's probably in her own shirts this morning but uh if if uh Hannah kinzer would happen to see this during the week we wish her a very happy birthday on Friday and we love her and her family very much we're glad to be in the presence of the Lord we want to go to the Lord in prayer again before we approach the word we are deeply concerned about the nation of Israel today and uh feeling a little emotional uh so many of our friends who live in the land are are making their way out of the land and uh I'm asking the Lord to make a way for me to get to the land and they're asking God to make a way for them to get out of the land we were scheduled to leave on the 30th of this month to spend a couple couple of weeks there things have surely shifted and uh I I guess you heard the news in the night that Israel uh did a couple of strikes on the uh airports in uh in uh Syria one being Damascus did you know there's one verse of scripture in the Old Testament that we know for sure has never come to pass there's several that we feel like may not have had their actual fulfillment yet but one is the scripture uh prophesies the total annihilation of the city of Damascus and in the history of Damascus there's never been a time that the whole city fell we may be living in those days we may be quickly approaching the hour that God ultimately deals with those who have oppressed his will for so long we stand with the nation of Israel she is not perfect we know that the Jew Jewish people are not perfect people we know that the government of Israel has made many mistakes do you know why because men are in the leadership and where we get involved we can make mistakes but we know that God has called the New Testament Church to stand with the restored Jewish state of Israel it's our It's Our obligation it's our responsibility it's our privilege to do so because the Bible says that if we stand with her and bless her we shall also be partakers of her blessing so we get the benefit it's very unpopular uh anti-Semitism has risen since the War uh some some are predicting 2100% in the world 2100% uh you heard about the uh the the lady who played a very important role in in her synagogue who was stabbed to death in our country in our country yesterday because she's Jewish and uh the pro Palestinian uh celebrations and what do they call them demonstrations are increasing Even in our nation and uh we should pray for the safety of the Jewish people we should pray that God hides them I I watched an interview yesterday of a holocaust Survivor who was 9 years old at Crystal KN the night that uh that changed the history of the world it it became illegal to be a Jew in one night and uh over 100 Jewish men were murdered that first day businesses were destroyed it seems that we are approaching another another time and we need to be prayed up and we need to know the heart and the mind of the Lord for Israel and we need to be bold in our stand if you have a voice use it you're standing for God's word when you stand for the nation of Israel use your voice if you've got social media use it for something more important than just showing a picture of your supper you know people don't really care what you ate last night but we care if you'll take a stand for God's word I care about that and so we're just going to believe that uh that God will protect his people as he promised and I believe that Israel is going in for a for a a ground assault I believe it's the only way that she can bring an end to part of these problems we had the opportunity to do so in 2006 when they when they kidnapped one person one young Soldier and now we're dealing with over 200 who are being held captive if if you have been watching the the real news in the last few days um you will have read that that there are more and more reports coming out about the mutilation of the bodies that were found it's very difficult to hear it's very difficult to read and uh I know that so many voices out there say that it's not true but all you have to do is listen to The Men Who found the bodies and I don't know if you know this or not but a message believer is one of the soldiers in the Israeli Army who found some of the mutilated bodies a believer of this truth is one of the soldiers in the IDF in fact his picture was on the front page of what was the the New York Post and the shock on his face and the tears in his eyes it's it's animalistic I I know it's quiet in here but it's animalistic you know rape is just un there there's just no Toleration for it but but the thought of of taking advantage of a corpse is just more than I can stand and the thought of gouging someone's eyes out just to prove that you have them in a vulnerable place and this is just the beginning of the torture that many of those people have experienced and then there are those who don't believe it's demonic it's absolutely a demonic Force Hamas is controlled by a demonic Force the same anointing that fell on Hitler and we must pray that God look these are my people they're your people and uh I personally feel connected my great-grandparents were Jews from Lithuania they came to this nation hoping for a better life and hid their religion they hid their faith so that they could survive and they ended up owning a newspaper in in Raleigh North Carolina and being being quite successful at it but longing for home and longing for Faith and longing to be able to tell your neighbors who you are but so traumatized by what they had been through so um you know just be careful in in these uncertain times where you stand um because we believe that nations are are not judged by how many Christians they have but the Bible tells us that nations are going to be judged by how they stand with Israel the difference between a sheep nation and a goat nation is not how many Christians live there but the difference between a sheep nation and a goat Nation are those who stand for Israel are called Sheep Nations and those who reject her purpose or called goat Nations and the Judgment of the Lord is not just for tribulation period it's beyond Millennium and Eternity we want to we want to land on the right side of this anybody with me all right let's stand again we're going to go to the Lord we're going to pray our hearts get heavy I wake up in the night calling out for God's grace and his protection we have so many loved ones and so many friends that are there and uh I can't imagine this week our uh those the the young family that's living in our apartment this week they're going to try to leave the country on Tuesday would you pray that if it's God's will he'll make a way for them to get out and the main reason is because their little children are being so traumatized by having to constantly take them in and out of the bomb shelter and it's just hard to explain to little bitty children why you have to go spend hours in a little confined space and they're becoming quite agitated and so uh they're hoping to be able to get out for a little bit of a break and and we don't condemn them for that uh judge them no sir they need to do what is what is good for their family but we remember those who won't have that privilege who wouldn't be able to leave I doubt I can sing it but uh do you remember the Little Chorus we used to sing oh Lord God of Israel I have no [Music] clue do you do you remember enough of the words to put it up Israel God like thee in the Heaven There is no God like thee in the Earth oh Lord God of [Music] Isel that keepe Covenant and show with Mercy un to thy servants who walk before thee with all of their heart let's change the key let's take it up just a oh Lord God of Israel let's sing it till we get it there is no God like thee in the Heaven There is no God like thee in the Earth oh Lord God of is that keepeth Covenant and show it Mercy yes you do Lord

trust you we trust you oh Lord God I want you to sing that part again oh Lord God of Israel oh Lord God of is Israel there is no God God like thee there is no God like thee in the Earth oh Lord God of his Now sing this part that keepeth Covenant that keepe Covenant and show it Mercy that's who you are Lord that's who you are to thy servants who who walk before thee with all of their heart now pray with me Father we cry out to you on behalf of the nation of Israel and the Jewish people we pray for Israeli Arabs who live as citizens of the land who are fearful for their future Lord Lord we are not about death and it breaks our heart to hear of the suffering on either side of the conflict but scripture demands that we take a stand with your word all we know is that you're a God that keeps Covenant you are not a God that you should lie you're not a man that you should lie neither the son of man that that you would have need to repent and your word has made an unconditional Everlasting Covenant with your people you told us in your word that you're not only married to the people but you are married to the land AR it's Israel you're married to the dirt and you made a promise with your people and Lord we know that the day is coming that the blindness of Israel will be removed and they will see the scars in your hand and the Bible says all Israel shall be saved we stand on the promise of Romans chap 11 and we pray oh God that your hand will catch the missiles that the Iron Dome misses we pray that you will show yourself again the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and that you will wrap your loving arms around the the precious Jewish people wherever they are in this trying hour God we pray for the hostages Lord we ask that you will make a way where there is no way that you will give direction and intelligence and wisdom and Leadership and that there will be many survivors Who come out from among those hostages to testify that you are a God who watches over Israel and you neither slumber nor sleep we pray for the protection of the Jewish people in the nations of the diaspora in every scattered nation of the world we ask that you would cover them Lord and that you would stir in them in this hour a desire to go home they have become very comfortable in Europe and very comfortable in the United States and yet your word says that in order to have a part of the covenantal promise they must occupy the land so may The Same Spirit that Drew them there so many years ago on the wings of eagles the rabbis noted we pray that you will draw them home for such a time as this Lord I espcially pray for my dear friend Dove who has both a son and a daughter who are serving on the front lines in the South I ask you to watch over them and keep them he has sold out his comfortable life in this nation to stand unconditionally with your people he is truly a lion in Judah would you bless the work of his hands and protect his precious children to the glory of God lord you told us that there was a bride hidden behind the veil of Islam Lord my heart goes out to those who don't know you when we remember Hamas we remember that the Palestinian people chose them in an election in 2006 to represent them and therefore or there are very few innocent Palestinians they like Israel chose the wrong leadership and have paid an ultimate price but Lord if there's one if there's one that you had on your mind before the foundation of the world if there's one that you shed your blood for I pray that you will reach that one and any that are connected Lord to that one that they might find you in their fear that they might find you in their time of Calamity may they know that Allah is a farce he is not the god of the Bible he is not the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob he represents a false god May their eyes be opened and may they see that you are the deliverer that you are the one that extends your hand of mercy upon whom you will we ask this in the most lovely name of our Messiah bashem Adonai Yeshua hamashiach in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the Saints said let's give God praise for hearing [Applause] [Music] prayer what a good God we serve are you blessed by these musicians and the worship leaders let's thank God for them [Applause] today I hope you all will get around back around the in the sanctuary as soon as you can I need your support and your help this morning thank you for remaining standing for just a moment we're going to the word of God welcome to all of you who are streaming this Service uh all of you wonderful people greeting us even our pastor Ryan Jasper God bless you sir we are so thankful for the time that we had with uh with Pastor Ryan and with brother Jim H I spent 12 hours with them on th on Wednesday of this week and and and all of it was a blessing to us and uh we appreciate the little church there in in uh near uh Northern Illinois the little near the little town of Polo Illinois and uh we are looking forward to times of Fellowship together with them it's always wonderful when you find Kindred Spirits in the word there are few and far between in this hour and we appreciate that and I see so many here greetings us greeting all of us from the different parts of the world from Norway and and all across Africa God bless every one of you who are watching today uh let us turn in our Bibles to Revelation chap 5 I know that time is getting away from us and I have a a message that I feel like the Lord would have me to bring today I I want to call the I tell you I'm going to take my tie off again is that okay there's nothing more awful than than uh someone sending me a clip of the service and my tie is catty wonked over here like that that that looks so unprofessional so maybe it'll look a little less uh unprofessional not to have one on at all at least it won't be catty woned and I'll be able to breathe is that okay if you're formal you you you stumbled into the wrong church this morning no doubt about it Revelation 5:1 and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals now most translations of this verse are true to the King James in indicating that the scroll was written on inside and backside and sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seal thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon let me pause just a moment and say not your pastor not your favorite television preacher not even brother William brandham no man that's no man was worthy we love Servants of God we love the Ministers of Christ but when it came to opening up this book no man alive or dead was worthy to open the book neither to even look at the book John said in verse four and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders remember there are 24 Elders here one of the elders said unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and not only to open the book but to loose the Seven Seals thereof verse 11 and I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the Beast remember the four living creatures were there and the elders and the number of them was 10,000 times 10,000 plus thousands of thousands we have no way of knowing what this number really was but let us suffice to say it was a huge crowd and they were crying with a loud voice worthy worthy they weren't Whispering their praise help me you know they they weren't Whispering their praise they were crying with a loud voice worthy let me hear somebody say Worthy is the Lamb that was slain he is worthy to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and Glory and blessing all of this praise and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the Earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard I saying blessing and honor and Glory you know we should just say this together while we're reading let's read it together blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever let's let's do it again blessing and honor glory and power be unto him that sth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever doesn't it feel good to come into agreement with the heavenly host and give the lamb the praise that deser that he deserves you may be seated may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word I I want to I want to preach this morning in the time that I have W with this title buying property in a war zone buying property in a war zone I'm going to Jeremiah chapter 32 now I've been preaching 48 years that's my entire life nearly and I have never preached a message specifically in Jeremiah chap 32 but I want to use Jeremiah chapter 32 as the foundation for the subject buying property in a war zone it doesn't make a lot of sense would you agree to buy property in a war zone if you know that there is an occupying Army on the horizon why would you waste your money in an hour like that but God has a purpose God has a reason in Jeremiah 32 verses 1-5 it's on the board the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the 10th year of zedekiah king of Judah which was the 18th year of Nebuchadnezzar who is the king of of Babylon for then the king of babylon's army besieged Jerusalem and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison which was in the king of judah's house so make sure you get the foundation of this of this chapter Jeremiah the prophet is in prison yes he's not in prison because he's stolen money he's not in prison because he has abused somebody with his with his action but he's in prison because he prophesied an unpopular word from the Lord a and even the king who who wasn't so opposed to Jeremiah said I I think for your own protection we better lock you up now we go on to find what this prophecy was was about for zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up saying wherefore Dost thou Pro prophesy and say thus saith the Lord behold I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon and he shall take it so Jeremiah must have seemed like a traitor God was speaking some unfavorable things to Israel specifically to the people of Judah we know that the kingdom was divided and zedekiah king of Judah shall not Escape out of the hand of the calans now you see why he was upset because Jeremiah has not only prophesied that you're going to lose Jerusalem but he has now prophesied that the king of Judah is is going to be taken by the calans but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon his trouble was just beginning are you following me but he said and shall speak with him mouth to mouth and his eyes Shall Behold his eyes basically the word to the King was this I'm going to give you an audience with the king of Babylon that's not necessarily a bad thing but zedekiah wasn't very happy about it do you follow me stay with me now and he shall lead zedekiah to Babylon and there shall he be until I visit him sayth the Lord though ye fight with the calans ye shall not Prosper now zedekiah must have wondered whose side is Jeremiah on who are you for you're supposed to be an Israelite you're supposed to be for Judah you're supposed to stand with the Hebrew people but now you have brought a word from the Lord that says that the king I'm going to be taken captive by the calans delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon and I'm going to be carried away as a hostage to the city of Babylon and we'll remain there until the Lord visits Israel again I'm not real happy with that kind of a word Jeremiah so if you don't mind step into my prison stay with me step into my prison I'm going to lock you up because you can't be trusted but who in this house knows that you can't lock up the word of the Lord you you can turn the lock and throw away the key but you can't keep the KN word of the Lord from coming forth from the mouth of the Prophet the word of God bubbles in him the scripture says it bubbles in him until it finds a way to get out and it doesn't have to be spoken to the multitudes to come to pass it can be spoken alone in a prison house but as soon as the word of the Lord is released into the atmosphere the heavenly host the angels of the glor of the Lord rush they rush to assist the word you see the Heavenly Host they serve the word yes somebody said I thought they sered the Lord isn't that who the Lord is John 1:1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God down further and the word 14 or whatever the verse is and the word became flesh so Jesus was the son of God but he was the Living Word and so the angels of the Lord are assigned to to serve the word so it doesn't matter if they're announced in the Public Square or Fox News or in the newspaper or in the church house or in a closet somewhere with the door locked and all the windows shut when God speaks we're not cessationist here I want you to know we don't believe that God lost his tongue no we believe he still speaks the Bible said his as many as are led by the spirit they are the sons of God and if he leads you he ought to be able to talk to you and you ought to be able to know his voice Jesus said I'm the Good Shepherd and the Sheep know my voice so I don't support churches who believe that healing is for only for the apostles and I don't support groups who believe that the gifts of the Spirit are all finished because something more perfect has come I'm not supporting that he's still a walking talking God he's still able to speak a word let me tell you something a prayer that's prayed in this house in faith can shift the Nations that's what the scripture tells us somebody said well I don't believe that then why do you pray if you don't believe that prayer can shift things why do you pray so we do believe that when the word of the Lord comes out when it gets out into the atmosphere spere doesn't matter who hears it that's right doesn't matter who amens it the Angels attach themselves the Heavenly Host attach themselves they watch over the word the Bible tells us to see that it is brought to pass and may I tell you that no devil in hell not a Putin in the Kremlin as we learned some years ago not the Arafat in rala as we have learned many times through the years not a Hitler not a Stalin not a melini can stand against the word of the Lord When God says it you see now I'm not one of th those who has to add something to that I understand that uh some of the message believer you know they'll say God said it brother brandom spoke it I believe it I don't have to have that if God said it if God said it that settles it you see God can talk and I'm thankful for prophets I'm thankful for a five-fold Ministry I'm thankful for faithful believers who will parot the word of the Lord who will serve like microphones and declare and release the word of the Lord but I want you to know whether you believe it or not if God says it somebody told me this week I don't believe Israel will ever occupy all the land that God said they would oh yes they will you may be rotten right you may be a pile of dust but the day will come and you will know it that every piece of dirt that God promised to the descendants of Abraham will belong to them and so much more because God is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he would have need to repent you see the problem and I'm going to get off the the political part of this issue because I want to talk to you about something spiritual but I I I thought my is amazing how this kind of flows with the with the situation ation that we're facing right now the Jordanian people do not want the Palestinian people because they know that they're Wild by Nature they're both Arab and both Islamic both Muslim countries are are Muslim people believe in Allah and serve the same kind of Faith but they have learned that this is a PE well the Bible if you could just read the Bible the Bible would tell you that Ishmael the son of Hagar the the the prophecy that God released over his seed I'm not going to kill you you see the little baby could have died in the wilderness but God sent an angel to Hagar and protected her and protected Ishmael because remember what brother random told us he said Satan is just a tool in the hand of God to perfect the Saints and so God knows how to use the ishmaelites to get Israel where they need to be so that he can bring his promised word to pass if you're with me say Amen so God made sure not only did Abraham pack a little Supply to keep Ishmael alive but God made sure he sent an angel of the Lord to to watch over Hagar to watch over Ishmael he said no Abraham I'm not going to let him be the promised son I've already got a promised son but what I will do is I'll let him survive I will let him multiply but I need to tell you something about him he's going to represent a wild man he's going to be like a a wild ass that cannot be tamed what other kind of nature pokes people's eyes out and rapes the dead but the nature of a wild ass does that bother you for me to cuss I'm just King James today is that all right if you want to say a wild donkey but somehow it just does something to me to be able to say wild ass so pray for me that I can get more Sanctified there's something wrong with the people who thrive in such confusion as they and so Jordan says we don't want them and Egypt is is wild I want you to know as a nation politically I I was in Egypt just a few years ago for the third time and I wanted out I wanted out about 10 minutes after I got there Chad was with me and he can tell you that is not a place that you want to be in this hour there's an atmosphere there that is that is so volatile that it feels like any minute the whole thing could explode like a powder keg I wanted out I didn't even care if I saw the pyramids again just let me get out you can feel it in the atmosphere but Egypt has said we don't want them in fact all of the neighboring nations of Arab League have all said we don't want them so you're going to be forced to put up with their terrorism you know God doesn't look at it the same as man does God said any minute when all the details lined up according to my great provision I'm going to do exactly what I told Abraham I was going to do I'm going to give him the land and if there are savable seed I know this is too much for some folks here but if there are savable seed among the Palestinians they will have the same opportunity for salvation that you have and only God can look and know that you see I'm one of those who believes that every soul that was ever going to be saved was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and he already knew how many Jews were going to find their way out of the blindness until the day that National blindness is removed and only God knows how many Arab people how many Palestinian how many people of the Nations will will make their way in but he knows and you can trust him so Jeremiah is in prison for prophesying an unpopular prophecy now keep in mind that God's Talk is sometimes crazy talk I know that sounds disrespectful to some but God's talk can be crazy talk I I don't think you're agreeing with me so God must have never picked you up in the middle of the night a away and caused you to leave everything you knew and were familiar with to follow his voice he he must have never reached it because if he's done that if God relocated you by the spirit on if God told you to leave everything behind that's unfamiliar and follow his voice you ought to know that God's Talk is sometimes crazy talk it doesn't make sense to the human reasoning and that's why you and I have to shut down sometime our human reasoning and we have to say Amen so be it so be it in Earth even as it is in heaven because you see he can not only be Jehovah Gyra and Jehovah Rafa come on and Jehovah ni he can also be sometimes Jehovah sneaky he knows more than you and I know he sees more than you and I see and he can build and build and build to something until it just begins to Spring forth and come to pass so I want you to understand where we are this was the 11th year of King zedekiah excuse me this was uh we are in the 11th year of King Hezekiah zedekiah when Jerusalem fell so we are almost at the point where the city of Jerusalem fell to the calans and the Babylonians and they were carried away captive for 70 years so when Jeremiah is getting this unpopular prophecy the city is about to be forfeited into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar the king of the city of Babylon he was a caldan by nationality and so we understand that Babylonians are a subset of calans they are almost the same because because all Babylonians are caldan but all caldan were not Babylonians do you understand Cala is an area to the South and to the east of the city of Babylon at times the entire Babylonian Empire was referred to as Cala now I want you to look at Jeremiah 32 and I've got to move Jeremiah 32: 6-1 15 this would be a good place for me to save my voice and let's see if elas has learned his lesson did you hear them they're they're in intersection for you they said Lord help elas please so Pastor doesn't humiliate him further now I want you to read this like a preacher are you ready go and Jeremiah said the word of the Lord came unto me saying that's good behold hanil hanil the son of Shalom thine Uncle shall come unto thee saying buy thee my field that is in and Nao for the right of the Redemption is thine to buy it now hold on just a minute I want you to understand what happens God spoke to the prophet and he said to Jeremiah and he said your cousin is going to come the son of your uncle he's going to come and he's going to ask you to buy a field that is an anoth a a and you have the right of redemption to buy it how many of you understand the right of redemption read the book of Ruth and you'll understand something about that Kinsman redeemers ship read on so hanil so hanil mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison he had to come to the prison to even see him to make this proposition read on according to the word of the Lord and said unto me by my field I pray thee that that in aninth which is in the country of Benjamin for the right of inheritance is thine and the Redemption is thine B it for thyself then I knew that this was the word of the Lord how did he know it was the word of the Lord because exactly what the Lord told him came to pass the Lord said your cousin's going to come he's going to offer you a piece of land I want you to buy the land so here he came here came Han's cousin and he said I want you to buy this piece of land notice it is in anoth which is in the country of Benjamin now you know that the land is divided can you show us that that map and let's look at that real quick this this I this is actually not the map thank you so much I I didn't send you the right map if you uh look in your Bibles perhaps you may have a map uh if not you can certainly look it up but it will show you the land that was was a lotted to the different tribes how many of you know that so the the entire uh area of Jerusalem and Hebron all the way down toward the neev which is the desert in Israel down toward where the remone crater is and just to the east is that it yes great great now you can look the 12 tribes of Israel you see the different place places that are allotted to the different tribes look at that area there of of B Judah is a big piece of land it goes all the way down but the land of Benjamin see where it is it's right near Jerusalem and we know from history that the entire land of Benjamin had already been lost to the Babylonians so the cousin was offering to sell a piece of land that was already under the control and authority of the enemy who in the world would buy a piece of property in a war zone all of us yes sir if God told us to you better you better be one of those that understands that God may ask you to do some silly things you may pass panhandlers every day of the week and then one day you come up to the intersection and the says give that man something and you know it's him and you don't hesitate you didn't do it the day before and you may not do it tomorrow but today you're going to do it because the spirit of the Lord LED you to do it you don't have to know the reasons why and all that'll be accomplished by it if God said it yes sir you need to be obedient to that voice okay let's go back to the word and have uh Elias to continue to read and I bought the field oh look I bought it I I didn't consult anybody else I didn't ask my [Music] pastor I I I didn't go find me another Prophet somewhere who could help me I just did exactly what God Said to do he said he's going to come and offer you a piece of land I want you to buy it and so guess what I bought it go ahead and I bought the field of Hanam my uncle's son that was in anathoth and weighed him the money even 17 shekels of silver being very careful not to cheat him go ahead and I subscribed the evidence I subscribed the evidence I wrote out the transfer of deed wow want you to understand what's being said here I wrote out the transfer of deed and what else does he say he did Ellas and sealed it and sealed heed it what else and took Witnesses took Witnesses and weighed him the money in the balances so I have paid him his allotted price I have written out the transfer of deed and I have sealed it with a wax seal and a thread all right let's go on so I took the evidence of the purchase the evidence of the purchase is what the deed the transfer of deed and remember what he did he wrote it out and he sealed it with a wax seal and with a string that goes all the way around it so that if that string is broke even if the wax seal was in place if the string was broke then that title deed is no longer authentic it is no longer transferable it is no longer recognized okay now go so I took the evidence of the purchase both that which was sealed according to the law custom and that which was open so there is actually two copies one is sealed so that it cannot be open and another copy is available so that you can look over that and read I had some property transferred to me some time ago by by citizens of Germany and when they transferred the property to me it looked like something out of medieval times it was it was a scroll written uh rolled up and a wax seal and a band that went all the way around it and then a copy so that I could read what was contained I was told don't break that seal so Jeremiah is following the custom of his day he has evidence of the purchase that has been sealed he has evidence of the purchase that is unsealed he has followed the law and the custom read on and I gave the evidence of the purchase unto baruk the son of narah the son of Mah Mah in the sight of Hanam my uncle's son and in the presence of the witnesses and subscribed the book of the purchase before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison this is a legal transaction with all kinds of witnesses do you get that read on and I charge baruk before them saying thus saith the Lord of hosts the god of Israel take these evidences take these evidences take this title deed the one that is sealed and the one that is opened go ahead this evidence of the purchase both which is sealed and this evidence which is open and put them in a earn vessel put them in a clay pot yes now how many of you have ever seen the the clay vessels that the that the fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls were found in I've not only seen pictures but I've seen some of the very pots with my own eyes in the in the in the museum there in Israel uh where the remnants of the Dead Sea Scrolls are kept and they're still finding ancient Documents To This Day sealed readable after all of these years because they were deposited in clay vessels I'm just saying that slow just wondering if you'll get it where I'm going the evidences were to be placed in clay vessels earn vessels does anybody hear a New Testament scripture in your heart and we have this treasure hello hello we're going there read on that they may that they may continue many days right for thus saith the Lord of hosts the god of Israel houses and Fields and Vineyards shall be possessed again in this land I don't care what it looks like I want you to buy a piece of land that you'll never be able to enjoy come on I know that the enemy has encroached on the territory of Benjamin I know that you will never be able not not in anytime soon to plant a Vineyard or or or to plant a crop or to build a house but I want you to go and buy a piece of land anyway I want you to seal up the evidences of the transfer of the title in an earn vessel because I want to tell you something put that verse back up if you will the last part of that verse I want to prophesy something to you Jeremiah yeah houses read it houses and Fields houses and Fields and Vineyards and Vineyards shall be possessed again in this land what are you doing Jeremiah I'm obeying the word of the Lord I am carrying out a prophetic act to seal for time and posterity that God has not forsaken Israel he has not forsaken the Hebrew people you may go also into a Strange Land and become hostages to Babylon but one of these days hello you bought you really ought to stay with me come on one of these say one of see I know the punchline yeah one of these days I'm going to restore and you're going to be so glad that you own a piece of property what is useful less today valueless today will one day be a valuable piece of property buy it when it ain't worth anything you follow me buy it when it's been encroached upon buy it when there's an occupying Army on it because one day you're going to have the title deed and you're going to be able to disp dispossess the enemy and build Vineyards and houses and Fields again in this land do you see the prophetic nature of this story are you with me all right let let me let me just show you this see if we can get it a little closer to you I'm trying to preserve my voice but in the message Revelation 5 number one 1961 if you can read it like I would read it Go Adam in the beginning was given by power no no was given power was given Power by God to have jurisdiction over all the earth now let that sink in just a moment you all know that don't you Adam was he he was he wasn't just a gardener he had Dominion did he spoke and the birds had to fly he called in the animals had to come right did you know Adam was given the nature of the animal and supernaturally the name was revealed he named the animals all he had to do was call them come on and they just lined up and Adam the Bible said and Adam gave them their name right powerful he had Dominion let me tell you what we've been taught in our day that when he needed to move a tree he didn't have to get a shovel the whole earth and everything in it was placed there by the spoken word and so Adam was given dominion over the garden and he was to rule it by what the spoken word so his nagging wife came along and she said Adam that tree is blocking my patio come on and you know what he didn't say well honey I'll I'll get to it I'll get to it I'll get around to it any of you ladies ever heard that Jenna you ever heard that when I get a chance I'll get it done don't worry just be patient no Adam didn't do that he didn't have to he had dominion over all creation he just spoke the word yeah yes somebody said how do you get such an idea like that what do you think Jesus was talking about prophetically in the New Testament when he said if you've got faith as a grain of mustard seed you will say to the sycamine tree be thou removed and cast into the sea and he said it will obey you that's right he was reflecting back to the Dominion that he had given Adam in the beginning and so when Adam needed to move a tree that was casting shade on the patio and his wife wouldn't leave him all he had to do was say be thou removed and it was gone if he spoke and the Animals came come on now so Adam in the beginning was given Power by God to have jurisdiction over all the Earth read on when God put Adam on Earth he gave him the jurisdiction over all nature all animals all life everywhere Adam was an amateur God don't let that throw you for a loop the Old Testament tells us the very same thing yes Jesus repeats it in the New Testament don't you all he F speaking to the Jews don't you like the scripture that that says we are we are all gods g o d small G it means a it means a a a administrator it means an administrator of deity serving under the headship of a higher deity that's what he's saying oh and you know that's what you are you may not be functioning in the full of it I may not be functioning in the fullness of it in this hour but it's the potential that we carry read on but Adam Our Father forfeited it to Satan now what did he forfeit to Satan the right to have dominion over the Earth read on Adam lost the rights of that book he lost the rights of that title deed he Lo lost the rights of the book of ownership the book that says Adam you have dominion over the Earth Adam lost the rights to that book you got to have the proof you can't just say I own it all I have authority over it all you got to be willing to show you got to have the proof you've got to have the evidence and Adam lost the right to the book in the Garden of Eden do you understand when he listened to his wife read on he forfeited it when he listened to his wife and she listened to Satan's reading reason reasoning in the said of the word of God all right read one more from the breach paragraph 103 and we're going to move on Adam lost his inheritance the earth now it passed from his hands to the one he sold out to Satan read that again Adam lost his inheritance the earth now it passed from his hand to the one he sold out to Satan read on he sold his faith in God to Satan's reasonings therefore his eternal life his rights to the Tree of Life listen his rights to the Earth belong to him and he forfeited every bit to the hands of Satan read on he passed it from his hand to Satan therefore now it has been it returned and has been polluted and the seed of Adam has destroyed the inheritance that Adam should have had that's the Earth that's right see the seed of Adam look at the earth look at the wildness of the earth we live in right now look at the insanity of people around us look at the pollution of this earth look what sin has done this was a promised event we knew that it would end up this way but let's just be rejoicing that this is not the end of the story so let's catch up God told Jeremiah to obey a very strange command he told him to buy a piece of land from his cousin while the Babylonians were marching into Israel taking Conquering the nation enslaving the people why buy land just before an enemy takes it over and cares less about who owned it or who recently sold it or purchased it what value would it be to buy land that was soon going to be owned On Demand by the enemy what kind of a cousin would seek to sell you such a piece of land isn't that a good question Spurgeon said about this reference he said now this was a strange purchase for a rational man to make Prudence could not justify it it was purchasing an estate which was utterly valueless while the en he marched toward the city Jeremiah legally purchased the parcel of land he signed a deed for the property sealing one and leaving One open available to be read and he hands it over to Barack which means Blessing by the way Benjamin Land was already under Babylonian control at the time so this parcel was already under the illegal jurisdiction of the Babylonians he sealed a copy of the deed handed it to baroo and told him keep it in a safe place since it would be a very long time before it would be retrieved again but it would be retrieved are you still with me Jeremiah 32 2425 read it for us Elias behold the mount behold the mounts these mounts are engines of shot they are something like a catapult that was used in the time of the calans the mounts had already been pulled in to the edges of this parcel of land when Jeremiah was told to buy it now read on and know what we're talking about behold the mounts behold the mounts they are come unto the city to take it and the city is given into the hand of the calans that fight against it because of the sword and of the famine and of the pestilence and what thou Hast spoken is come to pass and behold thou seest it read on and thou Hast said unto me oh Lord God buy Thee the field for money and take Witnesses for the city is given into the hands of the calans This is Jeremiah the prophet checking with God Lord are you sure the more I look at this The Stranger it looks is there any possibility I misunderstood your instruction he's having this conversation with god he said look God the engines of shot are already in place the enemy is right here so close I can smell his breath I can see them and their weapons marching up the hill with my naked eye and yet you told me to buy this piece of land the enemy is upon us and will certainly occupy this very parcel of ground now I want you to listen at what God said it's about to get really good here in just a minute Jeremiah 3226 through 31 read it Elias then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah I just told you what Jeremiah says to the Lord now the Lord is talking back to Jeremiah go ahead saying behold I am the Lord behold that's you got to read this is God talking behold behold I I am the Lord the God of All Flesh now wait a minute you know who's talking right now here's what he said he asked a question can you read that question is there anything too hard for me no no no not for me is there anything too hard for me is is there anything too hard for me no God says Jeremiah Don't You Know Who I Am don't you know I keep my word why are you questioning me so I told you to do it and you did it and now it's done why do you want to talk about it now don't you understand that I am the Lord the God of All Flesh is there anything Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah is there anything too hard for me what's the answer no read on therefore thus sayith the Lord behold I will give this city unto the hand of the calans I'm going to give this city into the hand of the calans and into the hand of neb Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon and he shall take it read on and the calans that fight against the city shall come and set fire on this city oh now they're going to burn it down and burn it with the houses upon whose roof they have offered incense unto ball and poured out drink offerings unto other gods to provoke me to anger so first they're going to go up on the roofs and they're going to offer strange offerings to false gods they're going to defile every house of the Israelites can you imagine murdering a family tying them together on their knees in a living room poking one of the children's eyes out while they sit down at a table and eat the Shabbat meal right that the woman has just prepared what kind of an animal can do something like this it's not so very different than what was going on in Bible times we're just not used to the shock of such Madness they walked into a home and found a whole family bound murdered within 3 feet of the table where the terrorist then sat down and helped themselves to the meal that the mother had just finished preparing for Shabbat God said the calans are coming they're going to fight against this city they're going to go up on the roofs and burn incenses to their false gods they're going to pour out their drink offerings to other gods and then they're going to set the houses on fire and they're going to set the cities on fire and they're doing all of that to provoke me to anger is anybody reading that now read on for the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth now God said this is why I'm going to allow it I gave them opportunity to possess the land of the heathens while not participating in their Pagan practices but what did my people do this is what the word of the Lord is saying what did my people do they started worshiping false gods they started trying to worship me in the way they had observe the others worshiping their false gods they learned the way of the heathens remember that's Jeremiah 10 we're in Jeremiah 32 see they learned the way of the heathens they started trying to worship Jehovah in the way that bael was being worshiped and other gods and God said I'm not going to allow that to happen what I'm going to do is I'm going to provoke the calans I am sending my people into a 70-year Exile in Babylon because they wouldn't obey my voice I told them not to send their daughters down come on to lay with strange men I told them they had to monitor their their relationships with other nations because I had chosen them to be my own come on I told them I told them to be careful that they maintain the farming practices that God had instructed them to maintain and that they continue to dress in the manner that I had called my people to dress remember in that day it was you you don't mix wool and flax and other other threads together today the requirement is a little bit different but God still means what he says and says what he means I'm not trying to be offensive I'm trying to tell you if God says I want my people to be separate amen and I want everybody to be able to look at them from afar and know their mind I want them to be able to pass their farms and notice that their crops are not fashioned like the crops of other nations for I have told my people don't you put two seed in the same row that's all the other nations will plant corn and beans and tomatoes together but God said I want my people on to plant their crops one seed to a row why is there any real value to that the only value that we know of is God wanted the Heathen to pass by the Farms of the Israelites and no come on here's a farm it belongs to the ones who serve the unknown God yeah the god of Abraham the god of Isaac the god of no name is what they called him at times the god of I am he wanted everybody to know I've got a people and they're not living like the rest they're not behaving like the rest they're not conducting business like the rest when they give you their word on on you can take it to the bank come on they don't cheat they don't don't lie they don't twist the truth they don't steal from God they don't steal from one another this is what God Said but my people wouldn't listen and they started doing all the things they saw other people doing they watched it on the television until it became a part of their own culture hello they started fooling around and wasting their time with silliness instead of focusing the their lives on me and so I have allowed we're not living in the Old Testament anymore God said I have a new covenant with my people so don't you say for one minute what the church world says that this is happened to Israel because they rejected Christ I want you to know this that has happened to the Jewish people has not befallen them because they rejected Christ they rejected Christ according to the New Testament it's my fault that's right so I should have been the one to pay because the New Testament says Their Eyes Were blinded so that the Gentiles could see the light come on now somebody said well don't you remember they screamed out let his blood be upon us and so they had to pay the price they did they paid the price they finished their price and now they're under a New Covenant God said A Renewed Covenant amen so we're talking about old Old Testament behaving now and God said they they brought this on themselves for the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands sayeth the Lord and that is verse uh 30 one more verse for this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my Fury from the day that they built it even unto this day that I should remove it from before my face you don't need to lose sight of what God Said to Jeremiah by The Land by the land I don't care what it looks like by the land I don't care what your family says about you by the land because I am still in control now go to verse 36- 40 start reading it would you and now therefore thus sayith the Lord the god of Israel concerning the city whereof ye say it shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon By The Sword and by the famine and by the pestilence now you're fixing to get real good so read it like it's swelling behold behold I will gather them un I'll gather them out of all countries whether I have driven them in mine angry I did it God said I did it I drove them out of their land but don't you worry I'm going to bring them home and the devil is not going to be able to stop me that's what God's telling us behold I will gather them out of all countries whe I have driven them in my anger in my Fury and in my great wrath read on and I will and I will bring them again unto this place unto this place Jeremiah you see that piece of land out there that you just bought and sealed the deed my people are coming home one day and they're going to live right there on that piece of land I have had you to buy that as a prophetic act then I'm going to March you into captivity but the day will come that I'll bring my people back out of Babylon the same road they March down to to to Babylon as hostages and slaves will be the same road they March down Freer than air and read on it what he said and I will cause them to dwell safely I will bring them again unto to this place and I will cause them to dwell safely read on and they shall be my people and I will be their God you you know how it works yeah you know how it works you can say whatever you want to about your family but nobody else better criticize your family come on this is what God saying he saying they're mine and I'll deal with them the way they need to be dealt with you keep your dirty mouth on off of them because I'm going to bring them home and they're going to be my people read and I will be their God go on and I will give them one heart and one way that they may fear me forever look what Israel has to look forward to there's coming yet a day there's coming yet an hour the Bible said there will come a day that the that the names of the enemies of the children of Israel will know no longer be recalled in anyone's mind God said I am going to so ultimately destroy their enemies that no one is going to even remember their name that's pretty powerful promise isn't it read on I'll give them one heart one way that they may fear me forever read on for the good of them and of their children after them after them come on and I will make an Everlasting Covenant what kind of Covenant everl [Music] Democrats can't change it Republicans can't change it Independence can't change it come on Obama couldn't change it hello God said I'm going to make a covenant with my people that's Everlasting and and read on that I will not turn away from them to do them good but I will put my fear in their heart that they shall not depart from me amen God said I've not changed my mind about the land stay with me I'm closing after a while you will return I will gather you from All Nations where I drove you this land will always be your inheritance and not just this parcel that you hold the deed to Jeremiah but all the land that I have promised to your father Abraham are you with me the enemy's got to be dealt with first the land may not be worth much when the enemy gets a hold of it and who knows what they will do on that land and to that land I'm just comparing this I'm not saying I'm just comparing this to a modern situation did you know in 2006 when Israel withdrew from the Gaza I was in Israel and I saw what was happening in the land they they marched out of Immaculate Beautiful s homes fully furnished many of them didn't even take their bed frames with them when they left the government had promised them something unfortunately it wasn't exactly what they had been promised but they moved Israeli police Israeli soldiers had to drag some of their own people out of Gaza why because somebody read the book right they call them radicals and zealots and settlers they look down on them but somebody read the book somebody said how can our government Force us to leave the land that God has given us by an Everlasting Covenant I saw the interview of both soldiers and policemen who said it was the hardest thing we have ever done in our lives some walked off the job after 25 years of experience forfeiting their retirement there were Christian organizations in this nation that helped fund policemen who lost their pensions because they refused to drag Jewish settlers out of the Gaza in 2006 as this withdrawal was taking place there were unbelievable farms in Gaza under the occupation and I don't believe Israel was occupying the land that God gave them but under what is called the occupation Israel had turned that desert Wasteland of the Gaza into an oasis comparable to the Jordan Valley saw it with my own eyes I know what I'm talking about the carrots the carrots that they grew in Gaza I ate they were known all over the world to be the sweetest carrots scientist botanists were amazed how can sweet carrots come out of sand no nutrients how do you know how because the word of the Lord was I will cause this desert to Blossom like a rose Israel is one of the number one exporters of flowers and fruit in the entire world it is the number one exporter in the Middle East flowers roses did you know that in one year alone Israel exported more tulips than the nation of Holland in three years how is that possible because God blessed those settlers they built beautiful homes air conditioned some of them homes which is unheard of in that part of the world these green houses stretched as far as the eye could see where these unbelievable carrots were being grown synagogues as beautiful as what was being built in Jerusalem were built in the Gaza apartment complexes modern conveniences and the government of Israel decides that they have to withdraw because of the pressure of our nation and other nations of the world the only way to say to the world we want peace is to move out and leave everything behind can you imagine leaving the home that you had built with your own hands and money and not sure if you were even going to be paid for it but you had no choice but to leave and to leave quickly the withdrawal took place over a period of about three days tens of thousands of Jewish people left their homes properties synagogues [Music] malls there was malls in the northern part of GSA City this side of GSA City toward the toward the Jewish town of zot was a shopping ball that looked like something out of Dubai and in less than three weeks they had demolished the homes they had destroyed the fields they poisoned the crops I'm not just talking off the top of my head we have the proof the evidence is here they poisoned the fields and the carrots shriveled up in the fields under the effect of poison because they decided we would rather starve than to eat a Jewish carrot who's ever heard of a Jewish carrot is your carrot a Caucasian carrot because you grew it is yours an African-American carrot sister because you grew it merits don't know religion or ethnicity come on they feed hungry children anybody with me yes sir they feed hungry children they desecrated Jewish Graves they destroyed their synagogues they were told by their own imans why don't we turn these in we've been doing it for hundreds of years we've been turning Jewish places of worship into Islamic shrines for years we did it on the Temple Mount why don't we do it here in the Gaza but the people were so wild they refused to remodel the synagogues and they burned them and they destroyed them and in just a few weeks time what had been settlements and neighborhoods and Villages for people to live in Free Housing eat free food they didn't labor for and they destroyed every bit of it because of hatred and anger and wildness so please excuse me if I'm a little callous to the fact that trucks went in this week with no inspection the first round of trucks that took Aid into the GSA strip went in with no no no inspection because no one could decide on the Egyptian side who was qualified to inspect it doesn't take a genius to look for Rockets among the potatoes something seriously wrong I'm bringing this to your attention again because I want you to know that the war that's going on now is is so much more than what it appears to be with the natural eye this is a spiritual conflict that's been going on for years and the only solution is not war I'm not anyway saying that war is the solution God is the solution and the best thing that Israel could do would be just to return to the God of their Bible yes somebody said I want them all to know Jesus I just want them to know Jehovah for now I just want them to serve the god of the Bible with everything that is within them because they've got a promise they've got a promise they're going to get the land back are you with me I've not changed my mind the enemy will be dead with I saw the enemy coming and I already had a plan Jeremiah I always have a plan be prepared to hurry up and wait but I've got a plan lasted 70 years and when we read now here's what we're going to move into the last part of this for the for today when we read in Revelation 5 verse one and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside seal with Seven Seals let me read that for you in the complete Jewish Bible next next I saw in the right hand of the woman sitting on the throne a scroll with writing on both sides and sealed with Seven Seals that's what we're going to talk about next week when we read those verses we wonder if God was not using the symbolism of Jeremiah to bring something very precious into the newer Testament you see Revelation is a book of symbols do you do you believe that we can look elsewhere in the word word to get an idea of what the symbols represent but the truth is we Gentiles who always need signs who quite easily look over the voice we needed a prophet I don't want to offend anybody but we needed a prophet to help us discern the symbols of the Book of Revelation if you believe that say amen and God did not leave us without a witness he sent a word a sure word to help us understand the symbols of the book of the Revelation and when those seals were opened we didn't have to guess about what what each symbol represented we didn't have to guess what the White Horse was we didn't have to guess what the scale in his hand we didn't have to guess about the red because God gave a great biblical interpretation of what every one of those symbols represented if you believe that say Amen amen before the enemy Satan ever came in and tempted Eve the garden God knew exactly what would happen there do you believe it stay with me he looked across time in a manner that only he has the ability to do and he saw Eve being seduced and Adam taking on this Disobedience look at this verse in Timothy read it for me Elias 1 Timothy 21:14 brother and Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression dude to this Disobedience God would cast Mankind from the garden just as he drove Israel out of the land into all nations I want you to compare two verses of scripture for just a moment Genesis 3:24 read that for me so he drove out the man and I know you're tired let me just say I know you're tired I just need to come to a close here in a moment thank you go ahead so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the Tree of Life does anybody remember anything about those Cherry beams does anybody remember that the Bible said they had eyes within and without interesting isn't it we'll talk about that next week that word drove out of the garden it literally is the word for divorce God divorced them and drove them out of the garden compare that to Jeremiah 32:27 read it for me behold I will gather them out of all countries whether I have driven them in mine anger and in my Fury and in my great wrath I will bring them again unto this place and I will cause them to dwell safely you see here God's driving them out and here God's driving them in remember what we said about the sword the same sword that that guarded the way to keep them out is now driving them back in in you see the connection does anybody see the connection is that a stretch or can you see it he drove man out of the garden just as he drove Israel out of the land but after Israel was driven out in the into the hands of the enemy God promised to gather them from where he drove them where back to the land again back to the Garden again back to himself again and he said they will dwell safely in the land ultimately for that to be accomplished the enemy of their souls would have to be dealt with with do you believe that John 12:31 I need some help John 12 31:32 read it now now is the Judgment of this world now shall the prince of this world be cast out and I if I be lifted up if I be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me this he said uh 33 is it not there this he said signifying what death he should die Jesus was not referring to our need to worship him when he said he must be lifted up he referred to what manner of death he would have by being lifted up on the cross do you follow that this is a beautiful parallel with Jeremiah 32 before the enemy got a hold in your life listen God wrote a title deed Hallelujah he already had a plan for Redemption before the foundation of the world the lamb was slain to take away the sins of those who would possess the Earth ignoring God's plan for our lives we followed our own plan and we lived how we wanted to live but it never shook God God wasn't shaken when Israel rejected him and God wasn't shaken when you and I chose our own way he always had a plan it never shook him from his original intentions concerning us and even though we went about cursing and blaspheming full of unbelief and reving in the attributes of sin God was neither rushed nor discouraged he had an appointed time Galatians 4 veres 3-5 read them quickly we got to go even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we that we might receive the adoption of sons when is Israel going to have full possession of the land in another fullness of times juncture when the times fill up again yeah when Messiah comes again when everything is in place again and that's what we're beginning to see now is an unbelievable realignment taking place in the nations of the world to fill up the days of the Gentiles so that the mercies of God can return to the Jews if you understand what I'm saying say amen God already had a plan he already had a purpose he already had a promise look at Titus 1:2 in the Amplified resting in the Hope read it resting in the hope of eternal life life which the ever truthful God who cannot deceive promised before the world or the ages of time began he chose first he chose first we were able to choose him because in eternity passed he had chosen us as a part of his inheritance somebody said that smacks of Calvinism let's see if it smacks of scripture read Ephesians 1 3-6 do it quickly the pressure is on you brother blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ he's called us to the land according as he hath chosen Us in him whoa according as he hath chosen chosen Us in him the night we got saved the night you you accepted the pastor's invitation the night you came down and shook the preacher's hand is that what the word says somebody tell me what the Bible said before the foundation of the world that we should that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having having predestinated us unto the adoption of the children by Jesus Christ Christ to himself according to the good pleasures of his will to the praise to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us he hath made us what's the rest accepted in the Beloved accepted in the Beloved it's not God who's trying to make you feel like you're not being accepted by Christ that's the work of the enemy he made you accepted his blood on your life cries out you are accepted in him one more 1 Peter 1 18-22 for as much as you know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversations received by Traditions from your fathers but with the precious blood of Christ has of a lamb without blemish oh my the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot who verily was for ordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you before the foundation of the world God already had a plan the sun was already on his mind he was not an eternal son there's no such thing as Eternal sunship God Alone is Eternal but the word became flesh in the body of the son manifested manifested in these last times for you read on who by him do believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your Faith and Hope might be in God seeing ye have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirits unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently this scripture tells us why and how important it is to love one another without prejudice because it is a reflection of the love that he loved us with one more verse and I'm just stopping with no punchline can't make it today Revelation 138 and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world that worship is not the lamb put that back please that worship is the Antichrist if you look at Revelation 13 you put it in the right context and he said and all that dwell upon the Earth shall do what they shall worship him but there is a group that will never worship that Antichrist system somebody said well how do we know who who are they those whose names are not written in the book of the life of the the lamb slain from the foundation of the world I just missed that let's go back and catch the context I missed that I caught it so yes I caught it and I'm trying to correct it uh open Revelation 13 for me somebody I'm so sorry I picked the wrong the wrong place Revelation 137 let's go back one more let's go back let's get it right and there was given unto him mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue 40 and two months and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God to blaspheme his name and his Tabernacle and them that dwell in in heaven and it was given unto him to make war with the Saints and to overcome them and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and Nations and all that dwell upon on the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world if your name is on that book you will never worship that beast that's the context if your name is in that book from the foundation of the world not from the night you joined the church you chose him because he had chosen you isn't that what the word tells us and so your name wasn't written down we've sung all our life a new name written down in glory about the night we got saved but the reality of the word says that he knew from before the foundation of the world those who would choose him and those who would not choose him and those whose name is written in the book of the life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world will never B bow to the Antichrist system and they will never yield to his influence I don't know if you're aware of that Antichrist Spirit but the New Testament tells us it's already in the earth and it's already trying to influence us politically spiritually in the natural let the musicians come and it's up to you and I to make sure that we recognize anything that twist the truth of God's word to pull us back to the traditions of man amen it doesn't seem like a very good decision to buy land in a war zone Jeremiah questioned his own obedience but he didn't anyway because God said one of these days when they bring them home when I bring them home I want you to be able to hold up that title deed or someone in your place will hold hold up that title deed and say this was the doings of An Almighty God who has settled his people back into the land of promise we too have a land of promise as a bride of Jesus Christ these great Treasures of heavenly things have been invested and stored in Earth and vessels our bodies if the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead quickens your mortal body you'll also live in Resurrection Life do you believe that let's stand forgive me for not being able to bring this home I will on Tuesday night I thought I had enough time to get it in and I didn't but may God help us to be ever sensitive to the reality of the hour that we live in it's not just over a piece of real estate that the war is Raging it's over the spiritual Promises of God promises to the Gentiles Promises to the Jews and you and I have to be those who recognize God when he speaks and we have to be ready to move I want to love what he loves I want to hate what he hates does that sound radical for 2023 I think it does a bit I I think the church world looks at that as a very radical statement to make but it's really what what lovers of the Christ will do I want to love what Christ loves I want to be for what he is for and I want my life to stand against what he is against may God help us all father we we come to you today I I stand here pretty frail in my in my emotion because I I I sort of failed to bring this to the place where I desired to bring it I know you'll grant us another opportunity to do that I I pray Lord that those who are here will will yet somehow still be challenged to know that sometimes your your leadings your instructions may may feel foolish we may not in the moment be able to look and see the full value of what we're told to do we may be misunderstood by family members we may be misunderstood by by church folks just softly something we we may be misunder stood by by members of our own household by those we work with by those we fellowship with but your little bride is going to hear and discern and obey your voice in this hour because we like the Jews we now hold a title deed yes it is no longer in the hands of Satan Revelation 5 tells us that there was a lamb who was found worthy to open up the title deed of Heaven and Earth and when John looked in and saw his name he could not contain his Joy two translations of that verse tell us that that all creation heard I John emphasis being he shouted with such a shout cried with such a cry that even those things within the surface of the Earth heard his voice as he exalted the lamb there are many of us in this house today who have had the same privilege to look into that book now opened and in the hands of the Lamb find our name know that it was written there before the foundation of the world and sometimes father we just cannot contain our joy you knew me before by my mother had any thought of me and you loved me when I was yet unformed and you made a plan to show yourself to me and in me as your word declares and I am forever grateful my soul wants to sing my spirit wants to sing my body wants to sing your praise churchianity is not enough for your bride freedom is what we desire Liberty is What We crave for where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty there is freedom your word says we are remade and reshaped Hallelujah he whom the sun sets free has been reformed no longer a slave no longer a hostage no longer in Exile you you stepped away from your own people blinding their eyes that you might take from among the Gentiles a people for your name's sake and I'm one of those if you witness that you're one of those why don't you thank him right now Lord I Thank you that I'm one of the I'm one of those a stranger an alien from the common wealth of Israel standing outside your Everlasting Covenant and yet you blinded the eyes of your chosen that you might take from among the nations of people who would glorify you who would recognize their name in the title deed restoring to us what Adam lost dominion over our own emotions dominion over our own thoughts dominion over our own bodies and even sometimes we have to stand and take authority for our families because Satan is ever nipping at the heels of those we love but today we thank you we
