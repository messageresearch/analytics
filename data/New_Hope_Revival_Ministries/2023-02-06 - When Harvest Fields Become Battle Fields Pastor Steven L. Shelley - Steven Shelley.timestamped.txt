[1:00:24] but I Want To Praise Him
[1:00:26] in the good times and in the bad times
[1:00:30] when I see that someone is cancer-free
[1:00:32] and when I see that he chooses to take
[1:00:35] them by the way of the Grave God is good
[1:00:38] all of the time
[1:00:40] and all of the time God is good he knows
[1:00:43] what's best for me

[1:30:55] let's have a little testimony from our
[1:30:57] brother from Ohio
[1:30:58] [Music]
[1:31:01] [Applause]
[1:31:05] somebody wonders last night the Lord
[1:31:07] spoke to brother Shelley uh through
[1:31:11] brother Shelley to my wife and
[1:31:13] prophesied on some things that she
[1:31:15] needed to let go of and every last word
[1:31:18] of what he said was true
[1:31:19] [Music]
[1:31:24] foreign
[1:31:26] we knew all those things but we did not
[1:31:30] know that it was those things that was
[1:31:32] keeping her bound
[1:31:35] so after and and due to her due to her
[1:31:38] uh her handicap that Satan has Bound for
[1:31:42] all these years she was not even able to
[1:31:44] understand what brother Shelley was
[1:31:46] saying at the time but I understood so
[1:31:47] when I explained it to her it all made
[1:31:50] perfect sense praise the Lord so we just
[1:31:52] continue in the Lord amen
[1:31:55] hey man
[1:31:57] well we give the glory to Jesus
[1:32:01] we give the glory to Jesus
[1:32:04] we give the glory to you Lord you
[1:32:07] wonderful and worthy what you started
[1:32:10] you're more than able to finish
[1:32:14] [Music]
[1:32:17] what you started Lord
[1:32:20] you are more than able to finish
[1:32:22] [Applause]
[1:32:24] Lord Jesus
[1:32:26] not for our feelings
[1:32:29] God for our glory Lord any of ours but
[1:32:32] For Your Glory
[1:32:33] we're asking you to finish what you have
[1:32:36] started
[1:32:37] [Music]
[1:32:38] oh
[1:32:40] praise be
[1:32:42] to God
[1:32:45] praise be to God
[1:32:47] [Music]
[1:32:50] the Lord showed me
[1:32:52] one of the greatest revivals that was to
[1:32:55] come was to the plain people
[1:32:59] showed it to me years ago
[1:33:02] when I had only met
[1:33:04] strangers who were Amish
[1:33:07] but I began to hear about a prayer
[1:33:09] meeting that was taking place a secret
[1:33:12] prayer meeting that was taking place in
[1:33:15] Lancaster County and I began to pray for
[1:33:18] the plain people
[1:33:20] for the anabaptist people and God began
[1:33:23] to show me a Revival coming to those
[1:33:25] people and I believe it is yet to come
[1:33:28] and I believe this these that have come
[1:33:30] and joined fellowship with us through
[1:33:32] these last couple of years I believe
[1:33:34] they're part part of what God's going to
[1:33:37] do
[1:33:38] the first time brother elim told me
[1:33:40] about these Saints in Ohio my heart went
[1:33:43] out to them brother Elam you know it did
[1:33:45] I'm not just making that up
[1:33:47] my heart went out to them
[1:33:49] and and there we prayed that God would
[1:33:53] continue to reveal himself
[1:33:55] to them and I prayed then selfishly Lord
[1:33:59] bring some of them to us
[1:34:01] and let us meet them and last night that
[1:34:04] prayer was fulfilled and I hope we get
[1:34:06] to meet the rest of you all and I hope
[1:34:09] that what the Lord does there my my
[1:34:11] Holmes County is that is that where it
[1:34:13] is
[1:34:14] say it tell it brother
[1:34:24] praise God praise God
[1:34:29] right
[1:34:35] praise God
[1:34:36] praise God praise God
[1:34:42] Hallelujah we believe it
[1:34:45] praise the Lord
[1:34:50] Hallelujah
[1:34:52] I saw myself in a vision riding in the
[1:34:55] back of an Amish open Boogie where the
[1:34:58] Bible and brother Brandon's spoken word
[1:34:59] book in my hand and I knew that it
[1:35:02] wasn't just a Revival of the spirit and
[1:35:04] receiving the baptism of Holy Ghost but
[1:35:06] I knew it would be a Revival of
[1:35:07] receiving the message of the owl
[1:35:10] and it may be hard work and it may be
[1:35:12] slow work but we know that God is able
[1:35:15] to accelerate that work
[1:35:18] Hallelujah and bless bless there there
[1:35:21] are brothers and sisters
[1:35:23] listen there's been no one like the
[1:35:25] anabaptist people who have paid a price
[1:35:27] for what truth had been revealed to them
[1:35:30] when they when they realized by the word
[1:35:33] of the Lord that they were not to
[1:35:35] baptize babies with sprinkling and they
[1:35:37] begin to stand against the Church of the
[1:35:40] day they were persecuted and murdered
[1:35:43] they were assassinated for their stand
[1:35:45] of the truth and they they stood for
[1:35:48] baptism upon accountability upon knowing
[1:35:51] what you were doing and understanding
[1:35:53] what you were doing and then there was
[1:35:56] groups through the years that saw that
[1:35:58] it should not be entitled that it should
[1:36:00] be in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:36:02] again persecuted so we believe that
[1:36:06] about the time that Revival hits Asia as
[1:36:10] was prophesied by our Prophet that
[1:36:13] before that Revival could come back to
[1:36:15] Jerusalem it had to pass through the
[1:36:18] Asian countries on its way back and
[1:36:21] about the time we see and other places
[1:36:24] waking up to the message of the hour the
[1:36:28] restoration of apostolic faith then we
[1:36:31] know that whatever God's going to do he
[1:36:33] has to do it quickly
[1:36:36] because we still believe that there's a
[1:36:38] Rapture Resurrection for the bride of
[1:36:40] Christ
[1:36:47] Blossom Blossom
[1:36:52] I know you've been standing alive
[1:36:54] but would you slip back to your seats
[1:36:57] and remain standing for just a moment
[1:37:00] because when we read the word if you're
[1:37:02] able we like for you to stand because if
[1:37:06] there was anything
[1:37:07] anyone who should be honored
[1:37:10] and respected it's the word of God
[1:37:14] brother Branham told us that we honor
[1:37:17] the office of a man
[1:37:19] even if we can't honor the man
[1:37:23] and and I did not respect
[1:37:26] President Obama
[1:37:28] for many of the decisions that he made
[1:37:31] when he was in office but when I had the
[1:37:33] opportunity to be in the room with
[1:37:35] President Obama I stood for him and
[1:37:38] clapped for him as heartily as anyone in
[1:37:40] the room because I honored the office
[1:37:43] that he held
[1:37:45] brother Ram said if the Queen of England
[1:37:47] walked in the room you wouldn't you're
[1:37:49] not even British but just out of honor
[1:37:52] and respect for the office that she
[1:37:53] holds you would stand it would be it
[1:37:55] would be your duty and if all of these
[1:37:58] offices and positions are worthy now I
[1:38:02] did I did uh I did celebrate a little
[1:38:05] bit louder when prime minister Benjamin
[1:38:08] Netanyahu walked in the room
[1:38:10] I was a little louder
[1:38:13] and there may be a video
[1:38:15] somewhere on YouTube of me trying to get
[1:38:19] to a woman and pull her down off the
[1:38:21] table who was protesting president
[1:38:23] Netanyahu prime minister Netanyahu there
[1:38:26] may or may not be some physical evidence
[1:38:28] out there uh of me trying to get to her
[1:38:31] but before I could there was a young
[1:38:33] Jewish soldier that took her right off
[1:38:34] the table and pulled her down you can
[1:38:36] have all the opinions you want to have
[1:38:38] but in that moment you want to honor the
[1:38:41] office that somebody holds
[1:38:43] what should be honored more than the
[1:38:45] word of God
[1:38:47] chapter 10
[1:38:49] for the sake of time I may add another
[1:38:53] nail in my coffin by doing this but to
[1:38:58] save time I'm going to read it only in
[1:39:01] the Amplified because you've been
[1:39:03] sitting sitting and standing so much and
[1:39:07] I want you to have a moment now in in
[1:39:10] just a second to relax so I'll just read
[1:39:12] this quickly and bring you what the Lord
[1:39:15] has for us this morning and I I will be
[1:39:18] mindful of the hour the best I can and
[1:39:21] try to remember that some of you will be

[1:40:10] to what God will do what he did last
[1:40:13] night what he's already done this
[1:40:14] morning makes me look forward
[1:40:17] to what he will do
[1:40:19] and and whether you realize it or not
[1:40:21] he's he's really really good to us most
[1:40:24] all the time
[1:40:25] we have some amazing Services here
[1:40:28] I'm thankful it's him we don't know how
[1:40:31] to do it
[1:40:32] it's him
[1:40:34] Hebrews 10 35 and 36 do not therefore
[1:40:37] fling away

[1:41:43] waiting on some promises
[1:41:45] from the Lord may God add his Blessing
[1:41:47] to the reading of his word you may be
[1:41:49] seated just give me just a hair in the
[1:41:51] monitor please
[1:41:54] when I began to pray about this weekend
[1:41:58] I
[1:42:00] was looking for something a little more
[1:42:03] needy
[1:42:06] and there are some things that I have
[1:42:08] wanted to preach about now for for
[1:42:10] several years
[1:42:12] and when I sought the Lord he began to
[1:42:15] speak to my heart as he does that still
[1:42:19] small voice of leadership how many of
[1:42:21] you are thankful for it
[1:42:23] and he began to lead me and
[1:42:25] my my plan is to obey him
[1:42:30] no matter who could understand it and
[1:42:33] when I chose to go back to something
[1:42:35] that I had ministered in 2018 last night
[1:42:38] 2019 Maybe
[1:42:40] I thought you know reruns
[1:42:44] something has to really be good for me
[1:42:47] to want to hear it or see it twice
[1:42:51] I'm not a real I'm not a real leftover
[1:42:54] fan
[1:42:55] I eat leftovers
[1:42:57] but I like it when it's piping hot
[1:43:01] and fresh not microwaved why are you so
[1:43:06] quiet
[1:43:08] I know there are people who just rather
[1:43:10] have leftovers I'm not one of them but I
[1:43:12] eat them
[1:43:13] and I don't complain every time
[1:43:18] and somebody will say well would you
[1:43:20] like to see such and such of him I said
[1:43:22] no I've already seen that they said what
[1:43:24] do you want to see it again I can't
[1:43:25] understand why you wouldn't see it again
[1:43:27] I said no once was enough
[1:43:29] there are certain things I might watch
[1:43:31] like the Ten Commandments I've watched
[1:43:33] that many many times through the years
[1:43:36] and there are certain things that are
[1:43:37] worthy so I always feel for the people
[1:43:40] that might have to hear it again
[1:43:42] and then I knew what the Lord was saying
[1:43:45] and he directed me that we would spend
[1:43:47] the spring the rest of the winter the
[1:43:50] spring and the summer just as often as
[1:43:53] possible rehearsing
[1:43:55] and reviewing the things that God has
[1:43:57] spoken to us over the past few years and
[1:44:00] I'm asking the Lord that come around the
[1:44:03] fall time just about a month before camp
[1:44:06] meeting I'm asking the Lord for special
[1:44:08] Grace for us to be able to speak about
[1:44:11] some of the things that we've been
[1:44:12] preparing to say for many years
[1:44:15] but it's all in the Lord's timing and
[1:44:18] it's in his leadership
[1:44:19] there are some things that we want to
[1:44:21] know we want to know that are going to
[1:44:24] befall of the earth and the bride and
[1:44:27] there are some things about the great
[1:44:28] Revelations that the Lord has given to
[1:44:31] his servant that we want to understand
[1:44:33] as a body of Believers we want to make
[1:44:36] it very personal
[1:44:37] so I I struggle with the with the
[1:44:40] concept of reruns although I've done
[1:44:42] some since we have added some new folks
[1:44:45] to the body
[1:44:47] but last night before I went to bed a
[1:44:49] sister who was in the service sent me a
[1:44:51] text and she said
[1:44:53] even today I was pondering the story of
[1:44:57] the Gentile woman
[1:44:59] and God used the service tonight to
[1:45:02] speak to that to speak directly to what
[1:45:05] was in my mind and in my heart and I
[1:45:07] said okay Lord if only one person
[1:45:10] received what was needed in that service
[1:45:13] then it's worth it all
[1:45:15] yesterday when I sought the Lord he took
[1:45:18] me to these notes and if you would like
[1:45:20] to have a title I am going to speak for
[1:45:23] a little while on when Harvest feels
[1:45:27] become battlefields
[1:45:30] and if I would give it a subtitle I
[1:45:34] would call it guarding your Harvest
[1:45:38] and if I would give it a second subtitle
[1:45:41] I would call it fight or flight
[1:45:46] you see you're gonna do something
[1:45:49] in the hour that we're living in right
[1:45:51] now you're gonna do something you're
[1:45:53] either Gonna Fly or die
[1:45:57] you're either going to fight or flee
[1:46:02] amen
[1:46:04] when I woke up this morning the first
[1:46:07] thing
[1:46:08] that the Lord spoke to my heart
[1:46:11] was concerning an experience that I had
[1:46:14] many years ago
[1:46:17] and I couldn't find the original
[1:46:19] experience neither sister Alfreda nor I
[1:46:23] could find the original experience we
[1:46:25] have it I just couldn't put my hands on
[1:46:28] it
[1:46:29] but I found a place where I shared it in
[1:46:33] 2004 after returning from Israel and I
[1:46:37] want to share it with you before I get
[1:46:40] into the message is that all right
[1:46:43] we were visiting a place
[1:46:46] if I remember right Carrie Payne was
[1:46:49] with me and
[1:46:50] Steve Valenti was with me and
[1:46:53] does anybody else remember who was with
[1:46:55] me on that trip
[1:46:57] Eric Norman but wasn't there another
[1:46:59] person from here
[1:47:01] was that all it was
[1:47:03] anybody remember
[1:47:09] say that again
[1:47:13] okay all right all right so Eric Norman
[1:47:16] from Norway who is with the Lord
[1:47:19] and the brother uh Stephen Valenti who
[1:47:22] is Kendra's dad who is living in
[1:47:25] California now and Carrie Payne who
[1:47:28] moved off the campground today
[1:47:32] this is what came to my mind so strong
[1:47:36] we had a wonderful visit to Israel
[1:47:40] and I love to be there and I love to be
[1:47:44] there with people who are not
[1:47:47] familiar or who have never been before
[1:47:51] because I like details
[1:47:54] and when we're out like that most of the
[1:47:57] time the people will just let me run on
[1:47:59] and on and on and on and on and on and
[1:48:01] on never stop me they just let me talk
[1:48:03] about what I'm seeing
[1:48:05] and this particular day we had
[1:48:09] settled in a park
[1:48:13] a national park in Israel
[1:48:16] we were at the foot of the gilboa
[1:48:21] mountains
[1:48:22] mount gilboa
[1:48:25] from where we were at a spring
[1:48:30] einharod
[1:48:31] I could look across the valley and up
[1:48:35] the way and see Mount Tabor
[1:48:38] we were not too far from
[1:48:41] Armageddon megiddo where the battle of
[1:48:44] Armageddon will take place
[1:48:47] we were very close to the ruins of the
[1:48:51] city of batshion some of you have been
[1:48:54] there before
[1:48:55] one of the richest most beautiful places
[1:49:00] in Israel
[1:49:01] uh
[1:49:03] 30 minutes from the Galilee
[1:49:07] just a beautiful Valley
[1:49:10] and we were visiting the spring of
[1:49:14] Gideon
[1:49:16] it is an amazing thing to know that I
[1:49:19] have put my feet
[1:49:21] in a spring that Gideon
[1:49:25] drank out of
[1:49:27] to think that that spring is still there
[1:49:32] and I sat down on the edge of the pool
[1:49:36] there and some of you been with me there
[1:49:39] I sat down on the edge of a little pool
[1:49:41] that's been built around the spring my
[1:49:43] children when they were little ran up
[1:49:45] and down those those those little creeks
[1:49:48] those little little tributaries coming
[1:49:50] out of that of that to Spring I've sat
[1:49:53] there with brother and sister West and
[1:49:55] with April and and ginger and and so
[1:49:58] many others what a brother Greely and
[1:50:01] Jonathan and perhaps and so many others
[1:50:04] and as I sat down there the spirit of
[1:50:07] the Lord began to move on me
[1:50:10] and he reminded me of an experience that
[1:50:13] I had had
[1:50:15] where the angel of the Lord
[1:50:18] was showing a paper
[1:50:20] and on that paper I let me just read
[1:50:23] what I what I shared
[1:50:30] as I was sitting there and had my feet
[1:50:32] in the water
[1:50:34] the Sun was shining it was one of the
[1:50:36] most beautiful places I'd ever I'd ever
[1:50:39] sat
[1:50:41] the Bougainvillea was filled had filled
[1:50:44] the whole side of the mountain
[1:50:48] I don't know if you know what that is or
[1:50:49] not but that's that beautiful Crimson
[1:50:51] colored tropical Bush that had filled
[1:50:56] the whole top of the of the mountain and
[1:50:58] I could look around and see the
[1:50:59] yacaranda trees
[1:51:01] those beautiful purple blooming trees
[1:51:03] all around us
[1:51:05] it was such a beautiful spot and the
[1:51:07] water felt so nice
[1:51:10] was just kind of running through the
[1:51:12] story in my mind of Gideon and how his
[1:51:16] men were whittled down
[1:51:19] from the thousands
[1:51:22] to the 300.
[1:51:25] there was a test given
[1:51:28] to see who was serious about the Battle
[1:51:33] it's all right to be thirsty
[1:51:35] but you got to know how to drink your
[1:51:37] water
[1:51:38] and keep your weapon in your hands
[1:51:42] you got to guard your Harvest I want you
[1:51:44] to help me now you've got to guard your
[1:51:46] Harvest
[1:51:47] you can't lay down your weapons while
[1:51:49] you nourish yourself
[1:51:51] you got to have your weapon in one hand
[1:51:53] and you've got to learn to lap the water
[1:51:57] you reach right down like a dog if you
[1:51:59] have to
[1:52:00] but it's a lot wiser to have one hand on
[1:52:03] the weapon in one hand with your with
[1:52:05] your shoulder turned so that you can see
[1:52:07] what the enemy is doing
[1:52:10] and so as I was sitting there the Lord
[1:52:12] took me back
[1:52:13] to a very significant thing that had
[1:52:16] happened in the spirit
[1:52:17] concerning this story and when I told
[1:52:20] this I asked you does anybody remember I
[1:52:22] was standing where a list of names were
[1:52:24] being read
[1:52:26] and beside every name an answer was
[1:52:29] given to the side of the name and it
[1:52:32] either said Stephen Shelley
[1:52:35] fearful
[1:52:37] are faithful
[1:52:40] then the next name would have been
[1:52:42] called Austin Yantis
[1:52:44] and behind his name would have been
[1:52:47] fearful or faithful
[1:52:50] someone else's name was called and
[1:52:52] behind that name I heard either the word
[1:52:56] fearful
[1:52:58] are faithful
[1:53:00] and as I was sitting there I began to
[1:53:02] weep
[1:53:03] everything in my body began to tremble
[1:53:06] as I was sitting there with those
[1:53:07] brothers and I began to weep and I felt
[1:53:10] so solemn and so serious we've been
[1:53:13] having such a Carefree morning
[1:53:16] such a wonderful time taking in the land
[1:53:20] and all of a sudden it turned so serious
[1:53:23] as I began to weep I mean I began to
[1:53:26] weep and I thought about all the trials
[1:53:28] of life that we had come through all the
[1:53:31] battles of Church Life
[1:53:33] that we had been through I began to
[1:53:35] think about all the gains and all the
[1:53:37] losses
[1:53:38] those that God had added and those that
[1:53:41] God had taken away I thought about the
[1:53:43] victories
[1:53:44] and I thought about times that it even
[1:53:46] looked like we had been defeated
[1:53:48] times that it looked like we had
[1:53:50] succeeded and times that it looked like
[1:53:53] we had failed all of this was rushing
[1:53:55] over me that day
[1:53:57] all the comings and the goings of the
[1:54:00] ministry
[1:54:01] and I knew in the spirit that we were
[1:54:03] coming to the Final Chapter
[1:54:06] and we were hearing a call
[1:54:10] we were
[1:54:12] facing a test
[1:54:15] and as I told it that morning I said
[1:54:17] we're being shocked we're being
[1:54:20] surprised that's the way God does his
[1:54:22] business he's sometimes an unpredictable
[1:54:24] God
[1:54:26] the only thing we have to predict God by
[1:54:28] is his word if he's already spoken it we
[1:54:31] know how it's going to be it'll be just
[1:54:33] like he said it was
[1:54:35] but perhaps some that we thought would
[1:54:38] be faithful
[1:54:40] I'm reading
[1:54:42] have proven to have been fearful
[1:54:46] and some who we thought would be fearful
[1:54:52] are proving to be faithful
[1:54:54] it's not my judgment
[1:54:56] it's not your judgment come on now it's
[1:55:00] not our opinion
[1:55:01] we don't get to choose who flies and who
[1:55:04] dies
[1:55:05] we don't choose who who has the fight
[1:55:08] and who has the flight
[1:55:10] we don't choose who is faithful to guard
[1:55:14] the Harvest and who is so willing
[1:55:17] to leave the field that they have
[1:55:20] planted and sowed in behind
[1:55:23] to follow something else
[1:55:26] we don't get to know that ahead of time
[1:55:27] sometime
[1:55:29] in fact we're surprised the prophet has
[1:55:31] even let us know we're going to be
[1:55:32] surprised when we get to Eternity
[1:55:35] when God dealt with brother Randleman
[1:55:37] experiences he saw people in those
[1:55:39] experiences sometimes that he didn't in
[1:55:42] his mind he didn't think they would have
[1:55:43] made it all the way
[1:55:45] but he saw listen you and I don't know
[1:55:48] all there is to know
[1:55:49] we don't understand somebody else's
[1:55:51] Journey like they do
[1:55:53] are you with me
[1:55:55] so we have to put these things in God's
[1:55:59] hands
[1:56:00] I knew there was still time for a change
[1:56:03] I knew that some who were behaving
[1:56:05] fearfully
[1:56:07] would eventually become faithful
[1:56:10] and those who were behaving faithful now
[1:56:12] would eventually become fearful but that
[1:56:15] day
[1:56:17] weeping like a baby
[1:56:19] sitting on the side of that spring I
[1:56:22] looked at those brothers and I said men
[1:56:25] what will it be
[1:56:30] will you be faithful
[1:56:34] or In the Heat of the battle
[1:56:36] will you be fearful
[1:56:39] I want you to know that
[1:56:41] fear is rooted in Pride
[1:56:45] [Music]
[1:56:48] you may not understand that concept but
[1:56:51] fear is rooted in Pride it's that
[1:56:55] self-preservation that we have I I can't
[1:56:59] afford to trust
[1:57:02] because if I trust it means I have to
[1:57:06] surrender control
[1:57:08] so many of us struggle with fear because
[1:57:11] we struggle with being able to turn
[1:57:14] loose and Let Jesus be in control
[1:57:19] you can't drive as I said here Tuesday
[1:57:23] night I think it was there used to be a
[1:57:25] bumper sticker when I was a boy that
[1:57:27] said God is my co-pilot
[1:57:31] I knew even then that was kind of an
[1:57:33] ignorant thing to say
[1:57:35] you don't need a co-pilot through life
[1:57:38] you need a pilot
[1:57:40] you need somebody to Pilot your ship
[1:57:43] you'll need somebody who will help you
[1:57:45] get through the winds and the waves
[1:57:47] you'll need somebody that'll reach
[1:57:49] beneath the surface of the water and
[1:57:51] pull you out
[1:57:54] when in a moment's time you become
[1:57:57] fearful of what you had already
[1:57:59] conquered
[1:58:00] Peter had already defeated the winds and
[1:58:03] the Waves by keeping his eyes on Jesus
[1:58:06] but when he put his eyes on
[1:58:08] circumstances he began to sink
[1:58:13] this was there
[1:58:14] and as I mentioned last night the only
[1:58:16] way to get delivered from our fear is to
[1:58:19] grab a hold of him like Peter did when
[1:58:22] he pulled him into the boat
[1:58:24] and say don't let me go don't let me go
[1:58:27] don't let me go don't let me go
[1:58:29] you understand what that took
[1:58:33] I mentioned last night his arms in the
[1:58:35] film
[1:58:37] he's a little short fella he has what I
[1:58:39] call short people syndrome
[1:58:44] always making up for his height you know
[1:58:48] he was written come on
[1:58:51] don't get mad at me I'm not looking at
[1:58:53] any particular people
[1:58:56] I don't know how many people last night
[1:58:58] sent me pictures of their dogs
[1:59:07] the dogs were well represented last
[1:59:10] night on my phone
[1:59:12] I meant you and your dogs no harm
[1:59:17] I mean you I challenge people today I
[1:59:20] mean you no harm
[1:59:22] but Peter was always acting in the film
[1:59:25] and I believe in real life
[1:59:27] he was always acting like he had
[1:59:28] something to make up for
[1:59:30] he's in control
[1:59:32] he didn't ever want to be out of control
[1:59:35] when he finds out in the film this is
[1:59:37] not in the Bible but when he finds out
[1:59:38] in the film
[1:59:40] that his wife has miscarried he's out of
[1:59:43] control
[1:59:45] he just deals with a situation that he
[1:59:47] had no control over and it turns him
[1:59:50] into a tailspin
[1:59:51] and he struts around showing everybody
[1:59:54] who he is and and letting everybody know
[1:59:57] like some of you here today letting
[1:59:59] everybody know he's got a chip on his
[2:00:01] shoulder
[2:00:02] [Music]
[2:00:03] you know some of us just swallow it
[2:00:06] some of us learn just took our stuff in
[2:00:11] and others want to wear it on their
[2:00:13] shoulder so everybody can see how how
[2:00:16] worn out they are
[2:00:17] and Peter didn't care in the film who
[2:00:21] saw his problem but I want you to know
[2:00:23] he was a weepy little baby
[2:00:26] when God got through dealing with him
[2:00:29] and if you've got any sense at all
[2:00:31] church folks and I know you do you will
[2:00:33] ask the Lord whatever it takes
[2:00:36] whatever it takes to make me like a
[2:00:38] weepy little baby with my arms wrapped
[2:00:41] around Jesus saying all with everything
[2:00:44] don't let me go don't let me go don't
[2:00:46] let me go don't let me go don't let me
[2:00:48] go
[2:00:49] because no matter what happens
[2:00:52] we cannot afford to graduate with a mark
[2:00:57] of fearful
[2:00:59] when this thing is over we've got to
[2:01:02] have been faithful to the call
[2:01:06] if you believe that same man
[2:01:09] now when I brought this message I didn't
[2:01:12] read any of that I didn't talk about any
[2:01:14] of that but when I brought this message
[2:01:16] some years ago I started off with a
[2:01:18] statement and I want to use it again
[2:01:20] this morning if you don't mind if you
[2:01:23] don't fight for your beings
[2:01:25] come on
[2:01:27] the devil will take your taco
[2:01:32] your burrito
[2:01:35] and the whole enchilada
[2:01:42] yeah that's it
[2:01:44] somebody said that that's not a very
[2:01:46] spiritual statement oh but it is
[2:01:49] you see it's not just the beans he's
[2:01:50] after
[2:01:52] he doesn't just want to take a little
[2:01:53] something from you he don't want to just
[2:01:56] take your pocket change
[2:01:58] he's out to destroy your life
[2:02:01] anybody with me he's not just interested
[2:02:04] in your change first
[2:02:06] you have
[2:02:08] he wants to leave you busted and broken
[2:02:11] and bruised
[2:02:13] with no help with no hope with no way
[2:02:17] out
[2:02:19] he wants to destroy your self-esteem
[2:02:22] he wants to cover you in shame he wants
[2:02:26] to sore arrest you that you feel that
[2:02:29] sister hope was talking about today I'm
[2:02:31] too dirty
[2:02:34] I want to tell you today you are not too
[2:02:38] dirty for the Lord
[2:02:41] you've not done too much are gone too
[2:02:46] far today that his hand won't reach
[2:02:48] beneath the wave
[2:02:53] you don't know like I know
[2:02:55] what he's done for me
[2:02:57] I want somebody to say that with
[2:02:59] conviction you don't know what I know
[2:03:02] some of you visitors
[2:03:04] some of you newcomers you don't know who
[2:03:06] you worship with
[2:03:09] you don't know what some of us were
[2:03:13] when when the Lord found us
[2:03:16] somebody said I found the Lord I didn't
[2:03:18] know he was lost
[2:03:20] you didn't find the Lord the Lord found
[2:03:22] you

[2:03:47] place too dark

[2:03:57] to get to where you are

[2:04:44] that have served jail time and prison
[2:04:46] time

[2:04:53] liars and robbers
[2:04:55] that God has gloriously saved and
[2:04:59] delivered

[2:05:08] highest Hallelujah

[2:06:17] [Applause]
[2:06:21] you don't know like I know
[2:06:24] [Applause]
[2:06:27] there are those in this room who have
[2:06:29] lived in abusive situations
[2:06:33] when I was a child I lived in an abusive
[2:06:36] situation where my mother was physically
[2:06:39] beat
[2:06:41] multiple times sent to the hospital
[2:06:44] wore stitches to her bank job
[2:06:49] you couldn't afford to miss much work
[2:06:52] so she had to just cake on more makeup
[2:06:56] to cover the bruises
[2:06:58] and to try to disguise the stitches
[2:07:01] because somebody who was supposed to
[2:07:03] love her
[2:07:04] broker
[2:07:06] bitter
[2:07:08] wanted to kill her
[2:07:10] let me tell you something life has not
[2:07:12] been glamorous for most of us
[2:07:15] and we are not here to buy
[2:07:19] we are not here today to lick our wounds
[2:07:21] or to get you to feel sorry for us
[2:07:25] [Music]
[2:07:27] there's men in this room who never knew
[2:07:29] the love of a father
[2:07:31] they're good with sisters in this room
[2:07:33] that never knew it that he's loved there
[2:07:36] are people here today that never knew a
[2:07:37] mother's love
[2:07:40] there are people here who grew up in an
[2:07:42] atmosphere screaming and hollering and
[2:07:44] Dish throwing and door slamming and
[2:07:47] holes punched through the walls
[2:07:52] we're not here
[2:07:54] to rehearse
[2:07:57] we didn't all grow up in a spiritual
[2:07:58] Utopia
[2:08:00] we didn't all go to perfect little
[2:08:01] churches where everybody loved each
[2:08:03] other
[2:08:05] some of the deepest hurts I've ever
[2:08:07] known in my life have been in church
[2:08:08] where preachers run away with piano
[2:08:11] players and oh yeah
[2:08:14] deacons ran away with this and this and
[2:08:17] that and the other and and men that you
[2:08:19] trust to carry the word you find out
[2:08:22] they're alcoholics
[2:08:24] and drug addicts
[2:08:28] when you begin to find yourself having
[2:08:30] to cover
[2:08:33] or your preacher friends
[2:08:35] because they're high
[2:08:37] when they go to the pulpit
[2:08:40] something's wrong
[2:08:42] and I lived that way nearly 10 years of
[2:08:44] my life
[2:08:45] I know exactly what it feels like to
[2:08:48] have to cover for people who have never
[2:08:50] found their real Deliverance
[2:08:53] and yet the gift that is in their life
[2:08:55] is without repentance and God continues
[2:08:59] to use them even though they are really
[2:09:02] twisted messes on the inside
[2:09:05] and what would keep a man like that from
[2:09:07] getting his help there's no other word
[2:09:10] for it except Pride
[2:09:14] we love our reputation and we love the
[2:09:17] way people look at us and the way we
[2:09:19] love the way that people honor us but I
[2:09:21] want you to know something we're coming
[2:09:22] to an hour right now where you're not
[2:09:25] going to be able to fake it until you
[2:09:27] make it
[2:09:29] and that is
[2:09:31] there are people out there that have got
[2:09:33] to have God and they've got to have him
[2:09:34] now they don't want your hypocrisy
[2:09:38] they don't want your religion
[2:09:42] they want realness
[2:09:44] they want reality they want a god with
[2:09:47] skin on him
[2:09:49] guess what I've got good news that's
[2:09:52] exactly what God is raising up in this
[2:09:54] hour a little bride
[2:09:56] [Applause]
[2:09:58] a little charge he laughed around the
[2:10:00] world
[2:10:01] that could be god with skin on him
[2:10:06] the little child was terrified of the
[2:10:09] storm
[2:10:10] didn't matter how much Mama talked or
[2:10:13] daddy talked
[2:10:14] that Thunder would come that lightning
[2:10:17] would flash in and the little child
[2:10:19] would go tearing down the hall screaming
[2:10:21] I'm scared of the storm I'm scared of
[2:10:24] the storm and mother would go in time
[2:10:27] and time again Daddy go in
[2:10:29] finally one day Mama's sitting on the
[2:10:31] bed trying to comfort the little girl
[2:10:34] because she's so afraid
[2:10:37] sweetheart you know that God Is Watching
[2:10:41] Over You
[2:10:42] darling you know that everything is
[2:10:45] going to be all right you don't have to
[2:10:47] be afraid and little girl looks up and
[2:10:50] said yes ma'am yes Mommy I know that God
[2:10:54] Is Watching Over Us but sometimes I just
[2:10:58] need a god with skin on him
[2:11:01] [Applause]
[2:11:04] so mama let me hold you a little tighter
[2:11:08] brother that's not bless for me
[2:11:11] that's human need
[2:11:13] God very much are you here
[2:11:17] God very much
[2:11:19] understands our human needs for a god
[2:11:24] with skin on him
[2:11:26] if you believe that's amen
[2:11:28] sometimes people get so spiritual and so
[2:11:31] revelated we'll use it as a word so full
[2:11:34] of Revelation and so full of church talk
[2:11:39] and seal talk and thunder talk and
[2:11:42] manifestation talk and adoption talk and
[2:11:46] sons of God talk and all that they
[2:11:48] forget
[2:11:49] that there are people out there who just
[2:11:52] need to know
[2:11:54] that your life was bad
[2:11:57] and Jesus found you he wasn't lost you
[2:12:01] didn't find him he came seeking and to
[2:12:04] save that which was lost for they that
[2:12:07] are whole need not a physician it's
[2:12:09] those who are broken and needy
[2:12:13] and I don't want to get off this I need
[2:12:15] to but I'm going to get over just quite
[2:12:16] yet
[2:12:18] there are people in this room that could
[2:12:20] show you the track marks the scars
[2:12:26] people in this room that learn how to
[2:12:29] abuse the system
[2:12:31] and go from Doctor to doctor to doctor
[2:12:34] to get the pills they needed
[2:12:37] to feel good enough to get through
[2:12:39] another day of life
[2:12:43] and Jesus found them
[2:12:47] so I'm not here selling anything
[2:12:50] I don't have anything to sell
[2:12:52] I'm not here trying to talk anybody into
[2:12:55] serving God
[2:12:56] because if I talk you into it you won't
[2:12:59] last
[2:13:00] a half a day
[2:13:02] but if you make up your mind that you're
[2:13:05] not going to get away from him and you
[2:13:07] better know
[2:13:08] I better go ahead and tell you you can't
[2:13:11] run fast enough far enough Furious
[2:13:14] enough to get away from him if he's
[2:13:17] chasing for you
[2:13:20] you're going to come you're going to
[2:13:21] come to Christ
[2:13:23] if he's coming after you you're going to
[2:13:25] come to cry you're either going to come
[2:13:27] weeping and rejoicing are you going to
[2:13:31] come kicking and screaming
[2:13:34] but he will find you and claim you as
[2:13:39] his own
[2:13:41] why would he do that because of his love
[2:13:45] because of his love
[2:13:48] because of his grace
[2:13:51] because of his Mercy
[2:13:54] he didn't die to make you a church
[2:13:56] member
[2:13:57] he died to make you a child of God
[2:14:01] so if you don't fight for your beings
[2:14:04] the devil won't just take your beans
[2:14:07] he'll take your taco your burrito and
[2:14:10] your whole enchilada and he'll leave you
[2:14:13] holding a tortilla
[2:14:16] awesome I said I love tortillas I could
[2:14:19] live on tortillas
[2:14:23] you could unless you saw me eating my
[2:14:25] burrito
[2:14:28] then you'd want something else
[2:14:31] let me tell you something there's a few
[2:14:33] things I want you to remember about
[2:14:34] Harvest did we have those
[2:14:38] the quality
[2:14:40] and quantity of your Harvest
[2:14:45] is directly proportional
[2:14:48] to how you sow
[2:14:56] you're gonna reap
[2:14:58] what you sow
[2:15:00] some of us have suffered because we
[2:15:03] sowed seeds
[2:15:05] that bring harvests
[2:15:07] of suffering
[2:15:09] that God brought us through
[2:15:11] some of us couldn't pay our light bill
[2:15:13] because we wouldn't give God what
[2:15:16] belonged to him
[2:15:19] and he said I'm going to show you if you
[2:15:21] won't give me my part somebody said I
[2:15:22] couldn't serve a god like that that's
[2:15:24] your choice remember I'm not here to I'm
[2:15:26] not here to build a church I'm not here
[2:15:28] to sell you a religion I'm here to tell
[2:15:30] you the way it is
[2:15:32] if you can't God give God that tiny
[2:15:34] little portion of what he's asked us to
[2:15:36] give him if you can't sow that into his
[2:15:38] work and into his kingdom
[2:15:41] you'll stand in an empty Harvest field
[2:15:45] it's not just money we're talking about
[2:15:47] either we're talking about sowing all
[2:15:50] kinds of seeds
[2:15:52] if if you could only understand today
[2:15:55] the quality and quantity of your Harvest
[2:15:58] is directly proportional to how you sow
[2:16:00] the Bible said every seed brought forth
[2:16:03] of his own kind
[2:16:05] not plant turnips and expect to reap
[2:16:10] corn
[2:16:12] you can't plant tears and Seed of sorrow
[2:16:17] and expect to reap Joy
[2:16:21] so the quality and quantity of your
[2:16:24] Harvest is directly proportional to how
[2:16:27] you sow your seed
[2:16:31] determines
[2:16:33] your Harvest
[2:16:35] how many of you believe there's
[2:16:36] something to that
[2:16:39] so do you really want to be stingy with
[2:16:41] God
[2:16:43] you can't read reap what you don't sow
[2:16:46] in Luke chapter 6 verse 38 the Bible
[2:16:49] said Jesus said red letter give
[2:16:53] I'm not taking an offering we already
[2:16:55] did that
[2:16:56] give and it shall be given unto you good
[2:16:59] measure
[2:17:00] press down
[2:17:02] shake them together running over shall
[2:17:05] men give unto your bosom for with the
[2:17:08] same measure that you meet with all it
[2:17:10] shall be measured to you again that's
[2:17:12] what I just said
[2:17:16] I paraphrase that in my initial
[2:17:18] statement that they put up there the
[2:17:20] quality and quantity of your Harvest is
[2:17:22] directly proportional to how you sow
[2:17:24] your seed determines your Harvest that's
[2:17:27] exactly what Jesus is saying here for
[2:17:29] the same measure that you meet
[2:17:32] it shall be measured to you again now
[2:17:35] remember how God looks at that it's not
[2:17:37] it's not the monetary value of what you
[2:17:39] give
[2:17:40] it's according to your need
[2:17:43] I don't know this little brother from
[2:17:44] Indiana sitting back there with the
[2:17:46] glasses and I don't want the cameras
[2:17:47] there's no camera to go on even
[2:17:49] embarrass him in any way
[2:17:51] but he touched me today I don't know him
[2:17:53] I don't know his financial situation he
[2:17:56] might be a multi-millionaire if you are
[2:17:58] brother give some more
[2:18:01] [Music]
[2:18:04] but there was something brother Chris
[2:18:06] there was something about him walking
[2:18:08] down here early
[2:18:13] there was something about him walking
[2:18:15] down here early to put that out even
[2:18:17] when brother Greeley was still praying
[2:18:18] he walked down here to put his offering
[2:18:21] in and my first thought was I hope he
[2:18:23] doesn't feel embarrassed because he came
[2:18:25] early and came by himself and about that
[2:18:27] time here come brother up here and he
[2:18:29] didn't have to come by himself but there
[2:18:31] was something about that that caught my
[2:18:33] attention I have no idea what he put in
[2:18:36] that he may have put in a fake coin
[2:18:39] foreign
[2:18:41] I have no way of knowing what he put in
[2:18:44] but there was something about him
[2:18:46] walking up that aisle as a visitor early
[2:18:50] that grabbed the heart of God
[2:18:52] and it grabbed my heart
[2:18:58] that's what I want to say to you
[2:19:01] it's not whether you give a nickel
[2:19:04] or a hundred dollar bill
[2:19:07] we give according to what we have
[2:19:11] and God doesn't pay favors to those who
[2:19:15] give more
[2:19:17] he pays favors and blessings to those
[2:19:21] who give it for the right reason
[2:19:27] now wait till I tell you the church has
[2:19:29] got it all wrong
[2:19:32] because the church will tell you that
[2:19:34] you've never given anything until you
[2:19:37] give not expecting anything back
[2:19:40] I don't believe that lie in fact I think
[2:19:43] it's one of the dumbest things the
[2:19:44] church has ever said
[2:19:46] you would be a stupid farmer
[2:19:51] don't get mad at me I didn't say you
[2:19:53] were
[2:19:54] but you'd be a dumb farmer
[2:19:57] to to spend all day putting seed down
[2:20:01] not expecting to get something back
[2:20:05] you don't give to get
[2:20:08] but when you give you ought to give in
[2:20:11] faith
[2:20:15] you ought to give knowing that God is
[2:20:18] asking us to be faithful in our giving
[2:20:20] and you ought to give knowing that if
[2:20:23] you give one seed you don't receive one
[2:20:26] seed back
[2:20:29] please let me say again it's not about
[2:20:32] the offering plate I'm using that
[2:20:33] because that's what captured my heart
[2:20:35] more importantly captured the heart of
[2:20:37] God
[2:20:38] but it's giving of yourself
[2:20:40] it's working all day on Tuesday and
[2:20:44] coming to church anyway with a headache
[2:20:47] and playing the guitar
[2:20:51] it's working all day till seven o'clock
[2:20:53] on the computer at home
[2:20:56] and so easy it would be
[2:20:59] to miss a Tuesday night
[2:21:02] but to make up your mind I may not get
[2:21:04] there till eight o'clock
[2:21:08] and I'm going
[2:21:10] don't you know God that's a seed
[2:21:12] that's a seed
[2:21:14] that's a seed I'm only calling out of
[2:21:17] you it's also to the person that walks
[2:21:19] over a piece of trash and sees it laying
[2:21:21] in a church in the church floor and
[2:21:24] instead of saying I'm going to wait on
[2:21:25] scissors Jennifer to get that
[2:21:27] they reach over and put it in their
[2:21:29] pocket until they find a time to throw
[2:21:31] it away brother that's also sowing seed
[2:21:32] for the kingdom because whatever you do
[2:21:35] for God and for the least
[2:21:38] of his little ones
[2:21:42] that you have done unto me
[2:21:45] I've watched the blessings of God
[2:21:48] I've enjoyed trying to out give God
[2:21:51] I love watching what happens when you go
[2:21:54] above and beyond when you let the Holy
[2:21:57] Ghost speak to your heart and you pray a
[2:21:59] little more than you normally would or
[2:22:01] drive a little farther to help somebody
[2:22:03] than you normally would you see your
[2:22:05] brother and sister in the need and you
[2:22:07] don't close your bowels of compassion
[2:22:10] you got to be careful
[2:22:14] you've got to be real careful
[2:22:16] because brother random said there's one
[2:22:18] thing you don't want to be guilty of and
[2:22:20] that's praying off of somebody
[2:22:23] what God has put on them
[2:22:27] they want you to know there are things
[2:22:28] that God puts on his people sometime oh
[2:22:30] yes I know that I know that ain't gonna
[2:22:32] fill up the church
[2:22:34] but we might as well tell the whole
[2:22:35] truth
[2:22:36] there are some things that we go through
[2:22:38] because God wants to help us
[2:22:43] he wants to get to our heart issues
[2:22:46] so sometimes he has to offend our minds
[2:22:49] so that he can expose what's in our
[2:22:51] heart
[2:22:52] and you think you know what's in your
[2:22:54] heart you think you know what's in your
[2:22:55] heart you think you know what's in your
[2:22:57] heart until life takes a turn
[2:22:59] and then you start finding things in
[2:23:01] your heart you didn't even know was
[2:23:02] there oh God help me Lord Jesus forgive
[2:23:05] me oh God I didn't know that was there
[2:23:06] oh Lord I thought I had settled that
[2:23:08] years ago anybody with me I gotta hurry
[2:23:13] we're still doing okay for Tom you look
[2:23:16] a little tired but I understand
[2:23:19] second Corinthians 9 6 but I say this
[2:23:22] he which soweth sparingly
[2:23:25] she shall reap also sparingly
[2:23:29] and he which soweth bountifully shall
[2:23:32] reap also bountifully
[2:23:35] remember that Bountiful seed is based on
[2:23:39] how many seeds you have to sow
[2:23:43] and so that day when Jesus was standing
[2:23:46] near the temple coffer
[2:23:48] and the publicans and the and and the
[2:23:51] wealthy
[2:23:52] and the religious were walking in
[2:23:54] dropping all this money into the
[2:23:56] offering and and and walking away I
[2:23:59] thank my god I've been able to really
[2:24:01] give a big offering today and Jesus was
[2:24:04] it not at all impressed
[2:24:09] but here come a little woman with two
[2:24:11] little mites
[2:24:13] you want to see one that big glass
[2:24:15] cabinet out there before you leave you
[2:24:18] go over to that big glass cabinet and
[2:24:20] you will see there a real widow's might
[2:24:23] from the time of Jesus found in an
[2:24:26] archaeological dig in Israel tiny little
[2:24:28] coin just about like that just a tiny
[2:24:31] little piece of metal coin they called
[2:24:33] it a Widow's mind it's less than a penny
[2:24:37] and she had a couple of those and she
[2:24:39] dropped them in and it caught
[2:24:43] the heart of God
[2:24:45] it caused Jesus to be moved with
[2:24:48] compassion for her and he used her
[2:24:50] faithfulness to sow
[2:24:52] as an example to teach others how
[2:24:56] important it is to be faithful with what
[2:24:59] God gives you
[2:25:01] now there's not a person in this room
[2:25:03] that wouldn't wouldn't appreciate being
[2:25:05] wealthy oh please
[2:25:09] this is not a time to pretend to be
[2:25:11] religious
[2:25:14] nobody in here is going to turn down the
[2:25:16] big fat juicy check from the government
[2:25:20] or from your employer and you who don't
[2:25:24] even celebrate Christmas you've never
[2:25:25] turned down a Christmas bonus I'll tell
[2:25:27] you that right now
[2:25:31] preach mother
[2:25:34] because we appreciate having pocket
[2:25:36] change and we appreciate having money to
[2:25:40] pay our bills isn't that right
[2:25:43] but I want you to know sometimes if God
[2:25:46] were to give you what you've asked for
[2:25:48] what you thought you'd like to have and
[2:25:50] if he were to fill up your bank account
[2:25:52] overnight or he might let one of your
[2:25:54] get rich quick schemes become successful
[2:25:57] and you should find yourself with more
[2:25:59] money than you know what to do with
[2:26:01] don't you know God sees your heart
[2:26:04] he knows already you don't know what you
[2:26:06] do with it you think you do but you may
[2:26:08] not but God knows exactly what you would
[2:26:10] do
[2:26:12] you know one time I was asking the Lord
[2:26:14] for some money
[2:26:15] and I said Lord I really need some I'd
[2:26:18] like to have some money I need some
[2:26:19] money there's some things I'd like to do
[2:26:21] I want some money
[2:26:23] and the Lord spoke to my heart he said
[2:26:24] I'll give you what I can trust you with
[2:26:29] so many many are are like me
[2:26:33] you you can know that you have what you
[2:26:35] can be trusted with and God's been good
[2:26:38] to me I don't want to complain
[2:26:40] God has been good to me
[2:26:42] he's helped me in many many ways to
[2:26:45] clear up dead in my life for my family
[2:26:47] he's been very very good to me
[2:26:50] but I want you to know that I truly
[2:26:52] believe the more he can trust us with
[2:26:55] the more he will release into our hands
[2:26:57] and he knows exactly what we'll do with
[2:26:59] what comes our way
[2:27:01] you see there's a little widow woman
[2:27:03] here in this church who has a grandson
[2:27:06] that sometimes gives her a little extra
[2:27:08] spending money
[2:27:10] and she always gets excited about that
[2:27:12] little extra spending money and I don't
[2:27:14] blame her do you
[2:27:17] but after my sermon last night she's
[2:27:20] just as excited
[2:27:23] to thrust into my hand the tithe
[2:27:26] of that little check that little bit of
[2:27:28] money that her grandson gave because she
[2:27:30] knows the way to continue to have favor
[2:27:33] with God is to give keep Covenant with
[2:27:35] God is to give God what belongs to him
[2:27:39] and just about every time that little
[2:27:42] widow woman will say to me whoa hope
[2:27:45] he'd give me some more
[2:27:47] so I can give it to the Lord I can give
[2:27:50] the Lord his part
[2:27:53] come on now
[2:27:55] so wait reap
[2:28:00] you've sown prayed waited
[2:28:04] nothing comes
[2:28:06] in fact for some of you it seems like a
[2:28:09] harvest is long overdue
[2:28:12] sometimes we get tired of waiting but I
[2:28:15] am here to tell you today whatever you
[2:28:18] do do not abandon your seed
[2:28:24] do not abandon your seed
[2:28:27] my mind goes back to 20 how old are you
[2:28:29] Benjamin
[2:28:32] you're not 25.
[2:28:35] I should have asked somebody that would
[2:28:36] know
[2:28:40] my oldest son doesn't know how old he is
[2:28:42] let's try this again how old are you
[2:28:44] Benjamin 24 my mind goes back to about
[2:28:47] 23 years ago or no really 24 years ago
[2:28:52] to a time that we are standing on the
[2:28:54] border of the United States in Canada
[2:28:56] and Benjamin and it's in his mother's
[2:28:59] arms and we have stopped at the Border
[2:29:01] in Maine
[2:29:03] to come across from where we were
[2:29:05] visiting her parents in Canada and we
[2:29:08] have filed all of our paperwork
[2:29:10] for my wife her petition is processing
[2:29:14] to become a citizen based on her
[2:29:17] marriage to me and we have filed all the
[2:29:22] paperwork that we have been told to file
[2:29:25] and we've paid all the fees that we were
[2:29:28] told to to pay but nobody told us
[2:29:33] that we couldn't go and visit her
[2:29:35] parents
[2:29:36] in Canada while that paperwork was
[2:29:39] processing
[2:29:41] so we go across the border nobody says
[2:29:44] anything America don't say anything
[2:29:45] Canada don't say anything we go have a
[2:29:46] wonderful time with their parents and
[2:29:48] we're driving the rental car back across
[2:29:50] the border or I know I think our parents
[2:29:52] were with us mom and dad
[2:29:55] and we get there and they tell us to
[2:29:57] come in
[2:29:58] and that man looks at me and he says sir
[2:30:01] I don't have any problem with you coming
[2:30:03] in because you're an American citizen
[2:30:05] but he said I am going to have to send
[2:30:08] your wife and little baby back to Canada
[2:30:13] I want you all to know
[2:30:18] the heat was on
[2:30:22] I wanted to come across the counter
[2:30:26] and give him a good old God bless you
[2:30:30] smack dab on the nose
[2:30:34] and I said sir you can't do that to me
[2:30:38] you you can't do that to me we were
[2:30:41] there you all led us across you can't do
[2:30:44] that to me he said I have no choice it's
[2:30:46] the law you have abandoned your petition
[2:30:51] you file paperwork and before it was
[2:30:54] processed you left he said you've got to
[2:30:57] start the whole process over again and
[2:31:00] now she is going to have to spend all
[2:31:02] that time in Canada the the land of her
[2:31:05] birth
[2:31:08] but but sir we didn't know we we really
[2:31:11] truly we're not trying to break the law
[2:31:13] you have abandoned
[2:31:17] it if he said it once he said it a dozen
[2:31:20] times you have abandoned your petition
[2:31:24] you file the paperwork and before it was
[2:31:27] processed you took it upon yourself to
[2:31:30] come to Canada and now she will have to
[2:31:33] stay in Canada with the newborn and you
[2:31:35] will have to go home and she will not be
[2:31:37] allowed to cross the border until both
[2:31:39] countries have cleared the paperwork
[2:31:42] how long could that take well because
[2:31:44] you'll have to refile
[2:31:47] the process starts all over again
[2:31:49] because you abandoned your petition
[2:31:54] he said it could be three months it
[2:31:56] could be six months it could be
[2:32:00] I said sir is there anything you can do
[2:32:04] I'm a pastor
[2:32:05] I'm not a drug Runner
[2:32:10] I didn't set out to break the law you
[2:32:13] abandoned your potential I said yes so
[2:32:15] you said
[2:32:19] yeah yeah yeah you've called that to my
[2:32:20] attention I was ever done
[2:32:22] my wife is standing beside me she's
[2:32:27] Pat me on my hand
[2:32:30] stay on your side of the counter
[2:32:33] I'm ready I'm ready
[2:32:35] he was arrogant
[2:32:39] I said you're
[2:32:43] you're I'm an American
[2:32:45] why would you treat me this way
[2:32:50] I'm not a Canadian trying to come into
[2:32:52] the country illegally and neither is she
[2:32:55] we file the proper paper yes sir but she
[2:33:00] abandoned her petition
[2:33:05] we must have stood there talking about
[2:33:07] the same thing 11 dozen different ways
[2:33:10] for 30 minutes
[2:33:12] and finally he said wait just a minute
[2:33:16] he said I I don't know what to do
[2:33:19] he said I have the law to uphold
[2:33:23] he goes into the back room and leaves
[2:33:25] the door
[2:33:26] a jar about that far
[2:33:29] I said pray well honey we got to pray
[2:33:32] we begin to plead the blood of Jesus oh
[2:33:35] God if you've ever helped us help us now
[2:33:37] please help us Lord give us favor we
[2:33:40] don't deserve it but Lord we need it we
[2:33:42] did not know we did not understand we
[2:33:45] need you to move for us and I watched
[2:33:47] that man through the crack of that door
[2:33:49] doing this talking to himself
[2:33:56] he'd walk a little much
[2:34:00] I said we're in trouble
[2:34:05] not only did we get an arrogant one we
[2:34:08] got one that's got big mental problems
[2:34:16] he just goes back and forth and back and
[2:34:18] forth and back and forth and back and
[2:34:21] forth and finally he says
[2:34:26] and he comes out
[2:34:28] he walks over to me and he said you
[2:34:31] abandoned your petition
[2:34:38] get all of this paperwork he just starts
[2:34:41] doing like this
[2:34:43] stuffing it back in the envelope or the
[2:34:45] folder and he thrusted across the desk
[2:34:49] at me and he says get out
[2:35:01] now I'm going to pretend
[2:35:05] that I never saw you
[2:35:07] and I said thank you sir I'm going to
[2:35:09] pretend the same
[2:35:12] [Applause]
[2:35:18] can't file a petition
[2:35:21] and then on your own accord
[2:35:24] walk away from what you filed
[2:35:28] because you're tired of waiting
[2:35:30] you can't plant a seed and because it
[2:35:34] hasn't come up when you think it ought
[2:35:37] to come up you can't just abandon your
[2:35:40] seed I need somebody to help me
[2:35:43] somebody's got to have faith
[2:35:45] [Applause]
[2:35:47] you hear me sister Lily somebody has to
[2:35:50] guard that seed
[2:35:52] somebody has to say I planted it in
[2:35:55] faith and I'm gonna guard it in faith
[2:36:01] and one day I'm gonna repent
[2:36:05] [Music]
[2:36:06] [Applause]
[2:36:08] not in my timing
[2:36:10] [Music]
[2:36:12] but in the Lord's time
[2:36:16] Galatians 6 9 and let us not be weary in
[2:36:20] well-doing for in due season we shall
[2:36:23] reap
[2:36:24] read it I need help
[2:36:28] if we faint not
[2:36:31] another version of Galatians 6 9.
[2:36:35] said
[2:36:36] so let's not get tired of doing what is
[2:36:39] good
[2:36:39] at just the right time
[2:36:45] oh
[2:36:46] I can see your sister Crawford
[2:36:53] he kind of walked like this
[2:36:56] she's with Jesus now
[2:36:58] a van happens to be watching this you
[2:37:01] know I loved your mother
[2:37:08] her shoes sometimes got a little high
[2:37:11] for my liking
[2:37:14] I don't believe in high-heeled shoes
[2:37:16] on a woman twisting her
[2:37:19] her hips let's say
[2:37:22] she didn't twist
[2:37:24] she kind of stretch it
[2:37:32] I'd say come on says she always wore
[2:37:34] hats not always but some she would wear
[2:37:37] a beautiful hats come on sister Crawford
[2:37:39] and sing for us
[2:37:44] she'd make her way up there and she'd
[2:37:46] say you
[2:37:55] Can't Hurry God you just gotta wait
[2:38:02] yeah you gotta trust him and believe
[2:38:10] because he may not come when you want
[2:38:14] him but he's right on time
[2:38:22] no no he may not come when you want him
[2:38:29] but he is right on time
[2:38:32] let me tell you something
[2:38:35] I didn't start serving the lord
[2:38:37] yesterday
[2:38:38] he filled me with the Holy Ghost when I
[2:38:40] was seven years old called me to the
[2:38:43] ministry I started preaching at seven I
[2:38:46] turned 55 this year serving God is all
[2:38:50] I've ever known and if I haven't learned
[2:38:53] a lot of things there's one thing I have
[2:38:55] learned You Can't Hurry God
[2:39:01] but once you plant a seed I don't mean
[2:39:03] the point
[2:39:04] but once you plant a seed you can't run
[2:39:07] off and leave it because you're tired of
[2:39:09] waiting for it either
[2:39:10] because the thief the thief will come
[2:39:14] he'll dig up your seed he will steal
[2:39:17] your Harvest
[2:39:20] you know this dog came to me last night
[2:39:22] in the service when I looked around and
[2:39:23] some were missing
[2:39:25] and I knew they should be here
[2:39:27] this is where they belong to be
[2:39:30] the thought came to my mind oh God
[2:39:34] don't look at this
[2:39:36] like someone has abandoned their seed
[2:39:41] let it be God
[2:39:43] that you understand the reasons why
[2:39:47] people make the decisions they make
[2:39:49] but we should be very very careful
[2:39:54] about planting a seed and leaving it in
[2:39:56] the ground to go do our will
[2:39:58] we ought to be very careful with
[2:40:00] unsanctified Mercy
[2:40:03] God will tell you what to do if you'll
[2:40:05] listen to him but if you listen to your
[2:40:07] emotions they will not often lead you to
[2:40:09] obedience but you listen to the word of
[2:40:12] the Lord and the spirit of God in you he
[2:40:14] will lead you to obedience don't plant a
[2:40:16] seed and then walk off and leave it you
[2:40:18] stay anybody with me
[2:40:20] now we're never out of here till two
[2:40:22] o'clock do you need to stand up and do
[2:40:24] jumping jacks
[2:40:26] can you stay awake a little longer
[2:40:28] can I preach just a little while longer
[2:40:31] another ver another version said so
[2:40:33] let's not get tired of doing
[2:40:35] what is good at just the right time we
[2:40:38] will reap a harvest of blessing
[2:40:42] if we don't give up
[2:40:45] don't give in
[2:40:46] don't give up
[2:40:49] the timing of your Harvest is often
[2:40:52] determined
[2:40:54] by what you do
[2:40:56] while you're waiting for it
[2:41:03] you can speed up a harvest
[2:41:06] it depends on what you do while you're
[2:41:08] waiting on your Harvest if you're
[2:41:10] bellyaching
[2:41:12] if you're grumbling and complaining if
[2:41:15] you're reciting all the things you don't
[2:41:17] understand forgetting all the things you
[2:41:19] do understand am I with me everybody has
[2:41:21] doubt
[2:41:22] everybody has to deal with that from
[2:41:24] time to time but don't you get caught up
[2:41:26] in that vicious cycle whatever you do be
[2:41:29] careful about your thoughts watch the
[2:41:31] words that come out of your mouth you've
[2:41:34] got a lot at stake you've planted many
[2:41:36] fields with seed you have prayed and
[2:41:39] planted seed for your family
[2:41:42] you prayed and planted seed for your
[2:41:44] co-workers you've prayed and planted
[2:41:47] seed for your children
[2:41:49] don't leave the field now
[2:41:52] I I don't even mean a geographical
[2:41:54] location
[2:41:55] I'm in a state of faith
[2:41:58] a field where you have put something in
[2:42:01] the ground believing that God is going
[2:42:03] to give you the abundance of what you're
[2:42:05] planning the multiplication of the seed
[2:42:07] anybody still here
[2:42:09] let me tell you the Bible tells us whoo
[2:42:13] I need a rest
[2:42:20] just a minute I'll be right back with
[2:42:22] you
[2:42:23] do jumping jacks if you need to get your
[2:42:25] blood flowing we don't care
[2:42:36] we'll be right here
[2:42:39] Psalm 67
[2:42:41] verse five and six wait a minute go back
[2:42:43] I'm sorry I know Austin you want me to
[2:42:45] use that other verse and I have it here
[2:42:47] but I wasn't going to take the time but
[2:42:48] go back I have to
[2:42:50] Galatians 6 9 in the Amplified
[2:42:53] and let us not lose heart and grow weary
[2:42:55] and faint in acting nobly and doing
[2:42:58] right for in due time
[2:43:01] somebody look at your neighbor and say
[2:43:04] it's just about due time
[2:43:06] thank you son
[2:43:07] it's just about due time
[2:43:12] my Harvest is just about due
[2:43:16] my Harvest is just about due
[2:43:19] and at the appointed season
[2:43:21] my opponent season's coming
[2:43:24] You Can't Hurry God
[2:43:28] but it's coming
[2:43:30] at the appointed season we shall reap if
[2:43:34] we do not loosen and relax our courage
[2:43:39] and faint
[2:43:40] let us not go weary and well doing for
[2:43:42] you shall reap in due season if you
[2:43:45] faint not
[2:43:47] what you do while you're waiting on your
[2:43:49] Harvest is very important and if you
[2:43:51] look at Psalm 67 verse 5 and 6 and I'm
[2:43:54] going to hurry from here on out I got to
[2:43:57] because we don't have another service
[2:43:59] together we'll be back Tuesday night but
[2:44:00] many of you will be back in your homes

[2:44:12] you or you won't really greedy to you
[2:44:14] want to read it out loud
[2:44:18] let

[2:44:31] then
[2:44:39] it's a good thing you wasn't born to a
[2:44:41] black preacher
[2:44:46] cause you'd have failed
[2:44:50] you'd not make a very good black
[2:44:52] Preacher's Son
[2:44:54] you're supposed to read that like you
[2:44:56] mean then shall the Earth
[2:45:01] if you praise the Lord while you're
[2:45:05] waiting on your Harvest
[2:45:07] [Applause]
[2:45:08] [Music]
[2:45:10] he said let the people praise thee oh
[2:45:15] God
[2:45:16] let all let all the people praise thee
[2:45:21] Now read it
[2:45:26] man
[2:45:30] then
[2:45:33] shall the Earth
[2:45:37] yield

[2:46:16] greens are going to come up
[2:46:20] I've been waiting I've been waiting I've
[2:46:22] been waiting

[2:47:06] gel

[2:47:10] smoked turkey necks
[2:47:12] and that's what you season your greens
[2:47:14] with and if you Yankees don't quit
[2:47:17] turning up your nose
[2:47:20] over our greens
[2:47:24] I planted you
[2:47:25] [Music]
[2:47:26] the seed packet said it only takes so
[2:47:30] long
[2:47:32] I planted you yesterday
[2:47:36] and I don't have any greens to eat yet
[2:47:40] how many of you know do everything there
[2:47:42] is a season
[2:47:46] you can't rush the seasons
[2:47:48] you've got to accept the seasons if you
[2:47:51] want the favor of the Lord to fall on
[2:47:53] you in your waiting season you spend
[2:47:55] that time let the people praise thee Oh
[2:47:57] God let all the people praise thee then
[2:48:00] shall the Earth yield her increase and
[2:48:04] God even our own God shall bless us
[2:48:08] so I want to say again don't you judge
[2:48:10] nobody's praise in here
[2:48:15] somebody's too loud you just
[2:48:22] you don't need to tell them
[2:48:25] I know you mean well but you don't need
[2:48:27] to tell them
[2:48:30] you let the spirit of God teach him
[2:48:33] you was wild one time too
[2:48:36] spirit of God had to teach you a thing
[2:48:38] or two
[2:48:39] he had to help us we learned what order
[2:48:43] is and what acceptability is and what
[2:48:45] the right way of doing it is you just
[2:48:47] let people praise God someone said I
[2:48:49] don't like it when they wave them Flags
[2:48:51] tough
[2:48:53] nobody asked you about the flag
[2:48:57] well I don't like it when they leap
[2:48:59] across it nobody cares what you like
[2:49:03] we didn't hand you a menu when you come
[2:49:05] in here and tell you to order what you
[2:49:07] like
[2:49:09] you shouldn't judge somebody else's
[2:49:11] praise I don't judge you because you sit
[2:49:14] there like a six foot icicle
[2:49:16] [Applause]
[2:49:18] I don't judge you because you look like
[2:49:21] you've been sucking on a persimmon
[2:49:22] sometime when the word goes forward I
[2:49:25] don't judge you
[2:49:27] because you can't even wiggle your
[2:49:28] finger when the spirit's moving I'm not
[2:49:31] judging you
[2:49:34] so don't you judge somebody else because
[2:49:38] you don't know what they've been through
[2:49:41] they're watering the seed that they
[2:49:44] planted in the ground
[2:49:48] hey that's good
[2:49:51] that's good we gotta go home and I
[2:49:52] hadn't even preach my sermon yet
[2:49:58] I'm going to have to read it because I'm
[2:50:00] losing my voice
[2:50:02] I'm going to tell you something if I get
[2:50:04] excited and spit this lozenge out of my
[2:50:08] mind
[2:50:09] I am not responsible for who it hits
[2:50:13] so I suggest you on the front rows be
[2:50:16] very alert
[2:50:19] in case it flies out because it could do
[2:50:21] it and it would be Benjamin's fault
[2:50:29] but it sure does soothe my raw throat
[2:50:33] we all know that King David was a great
[2:50:35] leader of men
[2:50:37] he combined in himself the qualities of
[2:50:39] bravery and compassion and integrity
[2:50:42] that other that caused other men to
[2:50:45] Rally toward him and to his cause the
[2:50:48] Bible tells us that within his army of
[2:50:50] soldiers there were 30 plus Warriors who
[2:50:54] who in might in today's terms they might
[2:50:58] be called the Special Forces
[2:51:01] the Bible calls them Mighty Men
[2:51:05] a small militia of extraordinary skilled
[2:51:10] Warriors I'm blessed
[2:51:13] I have some mighty men fighting in this
[2:51:16] battle with me
[2:51:18] these men were the best of the best the
[2:51:20] strongest of the strong the bravest of
[2:51:22] the Brave
[2:51:24] they were the ones who would not flinch
[2:51:26] Under Fire the men on whom you could
[2:51:29] depend
[2:51:30] if you were surrounded by the enemy
[2:51:34] I may or may not know any of these
[2:51:37] people
[2:51:39] but I made this effort to connect
[2:51:42] with pop culture
[2:51:46] hmm
[2:51:48] to put it in another context
[2:51:51] these 30 men combined the strengths of
[2:51:56] Rambo
[2:51:59] Bruce Lee
[2:52:01] Chuck Norris
[2:52:03] and The Terminator
[2:52:06] uh
[2:52:14] I may not even know who some of these
[2:52:16] folks are
[2:52:18] but I may
[2:52:22] I think I gave myself away by choosing
[2:52:26] such old Heroes
[2:52:32] these were David's go-to guys
[2:52:35] when things got tough
[2:52:38] and in second Samuel 23 their names are
[2:52:42] listed
[2:52:44] but above the 30 plus
[2:52:47] there were three men three soldiers
[2:52:50] who were leaders of the 30. you don't
[2:52:52] have to show it
[2:52:54] in all Israel you couldn't find better
[2:52:56] soldiers than the three men listed here
[2:53:00] one man was named your ship
[2:53:03] bashabath
[2:53:05] another was named eliezar
[2:53:08] and the third man that was named
[2:53:11] Shama
[2:53:14] each man had risen to Fame by virtue of
[2:53:17] a great Victory one against overwhelming
[2:53:20] odds
[2:53:22] in second Samuel chapter 23 verse 11 12
[2:53:25] do I have a few more minutes
[2:53:28] after him was shama the son of a g the
[2:53:31] herit
[2:53:32] and the Philistines were gathered
[2:53:34] together into a troop there was a piece
[2:53:36] of ground full of lentils and the people
[2:53:38] fled from the Philistines
[2:53:41] but he stood
[2:53:44] [Music]
[2:53:45] but he stood
[2:53:48] but he stood
[2:53:50] in the midst of the ground
[2:53:53] defended it
[2:53:55] and slew the Philistines
[2:54:02] one man and God can Triumph for a
[2:54:06] thousand
[2:54:08] [Music]
[2:54:10] one man
[2:54:13] determined
[2:54:14] to guard his seed
[2:54:19] stood in the midst of the ground
[2:54:21] defended it slew the Philistines but he
[2:54:24] and it says and the Lord
[2:54:29] it only takes one faithful man guarding
[2:54:32] a field
[2:54:34] and the Lord will honor his faith his
[2:54:39] courage his obedience
[2:54:42] but if you can get two or three to come
[2:54:44] together
[2:54:46] they're strength in numbers
[2:54:49] when sisters join with sisters in prayer
[2:54:53] for lost loved ones
[2:54:55] when Brothers come together in prayer
[2:54:58] for a need among themselves
[2:55:01] it is the Lord it is not the men it is
[2:55:04] not Shama
[2:55:07] it's not a shamgar
[2:55:10] it's the Lord
[2:55:12] who wins a victory
[2:55:16] The New American Standard Bible says
[2:55:18] about Shema Sharma
[2:55:22] shama is really closer to the Hebrew
[2:55:26] pronunciation it says but he took his
[2:55:29] stand
[2:55:31] I'm wondering today before we go we
[2:55:33] gotta go
[2:55:35] I'm wondering who's going to take their
[2:55:37] stand
[2:55:37] [Music]
[2:55:40] aren't you tired of wading through the
[2:55:42] land of wishy-washy
[2:55:45] aren't you tired of wading through the
[2:55:47] through the land of in and out and up
[2:55:49] and down and on the top and underneath
[2:55:51] and
[2:55:52] on fire for God one minute and deader
[2:55:54] than the door now the next minute
[2:55:56] how many of you are ready to plant your
[2:55:58] seed and guard them
[2:56:00] water them with praise
[2:56:03] stay on top of the thing until the
[2:56:05] Harvest comes I cannot tell you the
[2:56:07] fields that we have abandoned through
[2:56:09] the years
[2:56:10] I cannot tell you the harvests that we
[2:56:13] have lost in our lives because we got
[2:56:15] tired of defending the field
[2:56:19] but there is really we're coming down to
[2:56:21] an hour punch your neighbor don't let
[2:56:23] him sleep
[2:56:27] we're coming down to an hour now where
[2:56:30] we can't afford to lose another field of
[2:56:33] harvest
[2:56:37] the Bible said the Philistines gathered
[2:56:39] together at Lehigh
[2:56:43] but he took his stand
[2:56:46] in the midst of the plot
[2:56:48] and defended it and struck down the
[2:56:51] Philistines and the Lord worked a great
[2:56:53] Victory we don't know how big the field
[2:56:55] was but we know it was literally loaded
[2:56:57] with lentils lencos were legumes small
[2:57:00] Bean like balls growing in a pod usually
[2:57:03] a reddish brown color they were an
[2:57:05] important basic Staple in the middle and
[2:57:06] near East and they are still today these
[2:57:09] lintels were needed to provide food for
[2:57:11] the local now I know people in here that
[2:57:12] like lentils I like lentils I'll eat
[2:57:15] lentil soup when someone serves me
[2:57:16] lentil soup but I want you to know I
[2:57:19] like something a little more substantial
[2:57:20] than a lentil
[2:57:24] you can hardly chew a lentil
[2:57:27] it's just so little
[2:57:29] give me a bowl of pinto beans
[2:57:34] you eat the lentils give me some pinto
[2:57:37] beans
[2:57:38] you eat the lentils give me some lima
[2:57:40] beans
[2:57:41] give me some green butter beans
[2:57:44] and then my favorite of all of them is
[2:57:46] speckled butter beans
[2:57:48] you have the lentils will you
[2:57:51] you enjoy them I'll eat them
[2:57:54] I eat them at Passover time with some of
[2:57:56] you different ones but I I'm not a
[2:57:58] literal fan
[2:58:00] but lentils were a staple food
[2:58:04] they could be eaten fresh I can't
[2:58:06] imagine that to be very exciting
[2:58:08] they could have been eaten fresh or also
[2:58:10] dried in the Sun for later use most of
[2:58:13] the lentils that we have are dried and
[2:58:15] ready to be to be to be hydrated in a
[2:58:17] soup or something like that
[2:58:19] I want you to know the enemy is
[2:58:21] strategic
[2:58:22] he knows exactly when to strike because
[2:58:25] the Bible tells us that year after year
[2:58:27] Harvest after harvest
[2:58:30] the Israelites would plow the field
[2:58:32] plant the seed cultivate the growth
[2:58:35] hold the weeds water the plants
[2:58:38] fertilize with fish heads and whatever
[2:58:41] else they did in that time so just about
[2:58:44] the time
[2:58:46] the bushes are big
[2:58:48] the blooms have passed
[2:58:51] the shells are hanging the legume
[2:58:53] shelter hanging on and it's just about
[2:58:55] time for Harvest
[2:58:59] why why don't they come when the ground
[2:59:01] needs to be tended
[2:59:03] because the enemy is lazy
[2:59:08] his children want something for free
[2:59:11] they don't know what good sweat can
[2:59:13] accomplish
[2:59:15] the enemy will come in and try to steal
[2:59:17] your Harvest without putting any effort
[2:59:19] into what's going on he'll wait until
[2:59:22] it's just about ready to verse forth and
[2:59:24] the Bible tells us that year after year
[2:59:25] when the lentils were ready
[2:59:28] the Philistines would come up over the
[2:59:30] hill screaming like a bunch of wild
[2:59:31] Indians
[2:59:34] scare the Israelites
[2:59:37] and they'd run off in the bushes and
[2:59:39] rocks and hide and the Philistines would
[2:59:42] come in with their baskets and and pick
[2:59:44] the lentils I tell you that makes me mad
[2:59:48] I don't mind to give the Philly I love
[2:59:49] everybody you can have a basket of
[2:59:51] lentils if you pick them you lazy bum
[3:00:00] shouldn't you put a little effort into
[3:00:01] this
[3:00:02] I shouldn't say that
[3:00:05] foreign
[3:00:06] I don't know how many times sister West
[3:00:08] cultivates the ground plants the seed
[3:00:11] pulls the beans
[3:00:14] snaps them
[3:00:16] washes them puts them in a bag and
[3:00:18] brings them to us
[3:00:20] I don't know how many times she's
[3:00:22] planted the corn and shut the corn and
[3:00:24] cut the corn off the cob
[3:00:27] silk the corn cut the corn off the cob
[3:00:29] and put it in Basket in bags for us to
[3:00:32] go right in the freezer that's how good
[3:00:34] she's been to us and others of you have
[3:00:36] been that good to us through the years
[3:00:38] we have truly
[3:00:40] reaped where we did not sow and not give
[3:00:43] God thanks for that
[3:00:45] but there was no reason for these
[3:00:46] Philistines to come and steal the whole
[3:00:48] Harvest they didn't even leave a a
[3:00:50] handful on purpose for the for the
[3:00:53] Israelites they came in and stole the
[3:00:55] entire Harvest while the Israelites the
[3:00:58] mighty soldiers of the armies of the
[3:01:00] Lord were standing over there with their
[3:01:03] knees knocking together
[3:01:07] afraid of the enemy's intimidation
[3:01:09] tactics and shama watch this
[3:01:13] he why he heard this
[3:01:15] he might have even witnessed this a time
[3:01:17] or two
[3:01:18] we don't know he might have run too
[3:01:21] but all we know is this one particular
[3:01:23] year he had made up his mind
[3:01:27] you've stolen my Peas the last time
[3:01:32] when you come this year you're going to
[3:01:34] find me with my sword
[3:01:38] and I'm gonna chop off a head or an arm
[3:01:41] or anything else that I because I am not
[3:01:44] going to let the enemy come in here at
[3:01:46] the last minute and steal my Harvest
[3:01:49] anybody with me
[3:01:52] the Bible tells us that the Philistines
[3:01:55] banded together into a troop
[3:01:59] they mustered for battle
[3:02:02] they assembled their armies they
[3:02:04] prepared they checked their soldiers
[3:02:06] they inventory their equipment they
[3:02:09] assess their readiness
[3:02:11] for the upcoming fight in other words
[3:02:13] they came in attack mode they were well
[3:02:16] prepared the noun Philistines means
[3:02:18] immigrants
[3:02:20] those who wander in and out of a country
[3:02:25] this is the this is the the
[3:02:28] this is where the Palestinians
[3:02:32] have descended from
[3:02:34] it had long been the custom of the
[3:02:36] Philistines to Rob Israel of their
[3:02:38] Harvest
[3:02:39] in various ways
[3:02:42] I want you to know I've got a scripture
[3:02:44] I don't have time to read in first
[3:02:45] Samuel 23 where they would wait until
[3:02:47] the grain was being thrashed in the
[3:02:49] floor and they would attack the
[3:02:51] threshing floor and steal the Harvest
[3:02:53] they waited till the hard work and even
[3:02:55] the Harvest had been done
[3:02:58] we're facing the same kind of enemy
[3:03:00] church are you with me I'm hurrying I'm
[3:03:01] hurrying
[3:03:02] he's strategic he's well prepared he
[3:03:06] wants your Harvest he wants the fruit of
[3:03:08] your labor he watched you prepare the
[3:03:11] field he watched you sow the seed he
[3:03:13] watched you hoe and pull the weeds he
[3:03:16] watched your Kinder plants beginning to
[3:03:18] grow and he carefully timed his attack
[3:03:22] when some of your efforts were beginning
[3:03:24] to mature
[3:03:29] John 10 10 the thief come at not
[3:03:33] but to steal
[3:03:36] and kill
[3:03:38] and destroy
[3:03:41] Jesus said I am come that they might
[3:03:44] have life
[3:03:45] and that they might have it more
[3:03:46] abundantly
[3:03:48] verse 11 says the people fled from the
[3:03:50] Philistines
[3:03:51] his allies left him there as the
[3:03:54] Philistine Army came in the Israeli Army
[3:03:57] ran out
[3:03:59] Sharma finds himself
[3:04:02] standing in the midst of the lintel
[3:04:04] field
[3:04:06] absolutely alone
[3:04:09] his buddies favored a strategic
[3:04:11] withdrawal
[3:04:13] that means they ran
[3:04:19] I want you to think about the bean feel
[3:04:20] for a moment a large flat field with no
[3:04:22] cover no place to hide
[3:04:24] with Bean Vines almost knee-deep
[3:04:26] your feet get tangled every time you
[3:04:28] move Wherever You Stand The Enemy sees
[3:04:30] you you're an instant Target
[3:04:33] the enemy can attack from all sides at
[3:04:35] once in whatever numbers he can muster
[3:04:37] so it's easy to find yourself surrounded
[3:04:39] on all four sides by people who would
[3:04:41] rather kill you than say hello
[3:04:46] even some Christians may suggest that
[3:04:48] the bean patch isn't worth fighting for
[3:04:50] they're bigger Hills to die on but shama
[3:04:52] was tired of watching his part of the
[3:04:55] Harvest stolen away because it could
[3:04:57] bless and sustain his family
[3:05:00] okay devil when you start putting your
[3:05:04] finger on my family
[3:05:08] you need to tell him that about your
[3:05:09] lost loved ones
[3:05:11] when you see the enemy touching your
[3:05:12] Center family
[3:05:13] you ought to fight for them just like
[3:05:15] you'd fight for your safe children
[3:05:19] you've got a right to do it
[3:05:22] defending the mean patch may have seemed
[3:05:24] rather insignificant to onlookers or to
[3:05:26] others who didn't value the field
[3:05:29] but the Bible said he stood his ground
[3:05:31] he stood in the midst of the field he
[3:05:33] stood in the midst of the plot but from
[3:05:35] the middle of the field shama had a
[3:05:36] different Bean patch perspective
[3:05:39] I love the Sharma it wasn't just a fight
[3:05:42] in the P patch it was a fight over the P
[3:05:45] patch
[3:05:46] if you're a Believer you don't need to
[3:05:48] understand excuse me if you're a
[3:05:49] Believer you need to understand there's
[3:05:51] a turf war going on
[3:05:53] Satan wants to steal the bride's
[3:05:56] territory her jurisdiction and Dominion
[3:06:00] he wants to your serve her Authority
[3:06:03] to Sidetrack the bride from her destiny
[3:06:07] Satan wants to cut the bride off from
[3:06:09] her source of nourishment he wants you
[3:06:11] to spiritually Wither in the field
[3:06:13] that's why he's after the pastors
[3:06:17] he desires to weaken you so that he can
[3:06:19] simply walk off with your inheritance
[3:06:22] with your Harvest
[3:06:23] shama it was personal something had to
[3:06:26] be done he had a cause although he did
[3:06:29] not exactly have everything going for
[3:06:31] him he was not necessarily a likely
[3:06:33] candidate for this battle alone
[3:06:36] if you look a little bit in his family
[3:06:37] history you'll find out he was the son
[3:06:40] of a g
[3:06:41] and and a G's name means fugitive one
[3:06:45] who flees
[3:06:48] his daddy was a Fleer
[3:06:51] his daddy was a runner
[3:06:55] so standing firm wasn't necessarily in
[3:06:58] shama's natural DNA
[3:07:02] you add that to the meaning of his own
[3:07:04] name
[3:07:06] some of you ought to be ashamed for the
[3:07:08] names you hang on your children
[3:07:14] people naming their children after
[3:07:16] fairies and mermaids and
[3:07:19] superheroes
[3:07:31] fireflies
[3:07:33] you're going to name your child Firefly
[3:07:35] you're going to stick that on your child
[3:07:37] someone recently told me I'm going to
[3:07:39] name my daughter Firefly
[3:07:45] are you crazy
[3:07:48] can't you find something that has some
[3:07:50] meaning to it
[3:07:51] spiritual
[3:07:53] holy word based meaning
[3:07:58] you want to name them after demons
[3:08:04] furthermore shama's name wasn't very
[3:08:06] powerful either it means waste
[3:08:09] desolation
[3:08:11] astonishment horror
[3:08:14] so his father was a runner
[3:08:18] and he was one who knows desolation and
[3:08:21] horror
[3:08:23] furthermore
[3:08:25] shama and his family
[3:08:28] were harareites
[3:08:30] the Hebrew word for heal is horror
[3:08:34] the plurality of the noun means Mountain
[3:08:37] dwellers
[3:08:39] these were considered the country
[3:08:41] bumpkins
[3:08:44] of the Old Testament
[3:08:46] them heal people them people that live
[3:08:48] in the Hills so shama had several
[3:08:51] strikes against his personal confidence
[3:08:53] my daddy's a runner I'm one who knows
[3:08:56] desolation I'm considered a country
[3:08:58] bumpkin because we come from the
[3:08:59] mountains and when uh when the battle is
[3:09:01] Raging I am the only one left to fight
[3:09:04] aren't you glad he didn't believe all
[3:09:06] the things that had been spoken over him
[3:09:09] help me we gotta go help me
[3:09:13] aren't you glad there's somebody in this
[3:09:15] house that doesn't believe every word
[3:09:17] that's been smoking over their life
[3:09:19] every time they were called stupid
[3:09:23] no good good for nothing never
[3:09:25] accomplish anything aren't you glad that
[3:09:28] Jesus rewrites our DNA
[3:09:31] aren't you glad he changes our name
[3:09:36] aren't you glad he gives us a blood
[3:09:39] transfusion
[3:09:40] [Applause]
[3:09:45] you see Church
[3:09:47] sometimes you choose your battles
[3:09:54] musicians come slowly
[3:10:07] you have to put your shoes on
[3:10:09] that's too fast slow down
[3:10:16] that's good Josh sure now show them now
[3:10:19] show them how it's done
[3:10:23] David you're always walking slow
[3:10:29] love David
[3:10:31] somebody give him a name they didn't
[3:10:33] give him a name that means
[3:10:35] wasteful desolation
[3:10:39] somebody hung the name of God's beloved
[3:10:42] on him somebody hung the name of a
[3:10:44] worshiper on him come on
[3:10:47] somebody cared about what he would end
[3:10:49] up being not just what he was in the
[3:10:50] Cradle
[3:10:53] you see folks sometimes we choose our
[3:10:55] battles
[3:10:57] sometimes our battles choose us
[3:11:00] shamba didn't particularly choose this
[3:11:02] battle
[3:11:03] but this battle chose Shama
[3:11:06] he didn't have all everything going for
[3:11:08] him that some of the others who had
[3:11:10] beautiful holy
[3:11:12] wonderful names and wonderful lineages
[3:11:15] but he had something going for him
[3:11:17] he was tired of the devil's best
[3:11:20] he was tired of being robbed from him
[3:11:22] and stolen from and taken advantage of
[3:11:25] anybody here like that
[3:11:27] anybody had your belly full of the devil
[3:11:31] ruining what God has started in your
[3:11:33] life
[3:11:37] here's the key about shama he was
[3:11:39] willing to plant his feet and grasp his
[3:11:42] weapon and let the Lord do the rest
[3:11:44] God's looking for somebody that'll hold
[3:11:46] the weapon
[3:11:48] let me tell you something you just don't
[3:11:50] know what can happen when you're willing
[3:11:51] to hold the weapon because once God
[3:11:53] crawls in that weapon it don't matter
[3:11:55] whether it's a sharpened sword or the
[3:11:58] Jawbone of an ass God knows how to use
[3:12:01] the weapon that's in your hand
[3:12:04] if you just show up and be faithful
[3:12:08] [Applause]
[3:12:11] the Bible said he defended it that word
[3:12:13] defend means to save the rescue or to
[3:12:15] deliver
[3:12:19] shama boldly removed this field from the
[3:12:21] grasp of the Philistines and he struck
[3:12:24] them down
[3:12:25] one
[3:12:26] by one
[3:12:28] I won
[3:12:35] I don't guess we'll get to any of that
[3:12:36] will we
[3:12:38] let me let me tell you something folks
[3:12:41] it's time
[3:12:44] it's past time
[3:12:47] for us to make up our minds
[3:12:49] that when the enemy comes to huff and
[3:12:51] puff and blow our house down we're going
[3:12:53] to be faithful to God
[3:12:55] we're going to be faithful to his word
[3:12:56] we're going to be faithful to his house
[3:12:58] we're going to be faithful to his
[3:13:00] servants
[3:13:03] um
[3:13:04] we're gonna be ready to fight no matter
[3:13:06] what comes our way
[3:13:08] the weapons that we fight are not
[3:13:09] against one another we do not fight
[3:13:11] Flesh and Blood we fight principalities
[3:13:14] and spiritual Powers wickedness
[3:13:15] spiritual powers in high places we're
[3:13:18] fighting a spiritual battle a
[3:13:20] supernatural battle but how many of you
[3:13:22] know God's given us everything we need
[3:13:25] to defeat the enemy and the prophet told
[3:13:27] us that everything we need to make the
[3:13:29] Rapture is in us right now
[3:13:32] we have nothing to be afraid of the only
[3:13:34] thing we fear the only thing to be
[3:13:37] feared is fear itself
[3:13:38] and all that means is if you yield to
[3:13:40] fear fear will paralyze you but if you
[3:13:43] make up your mind that I'm going to be
[3:13:44] faithful when the Lord calls my name I'm
[3:13:47] going to be found faithful
[3:13:49] what does it mean to be faithful it
[3:13:51] means to be doing what you have
[3:13:52] committed to do
[3:13:54] you show up
[3:13:57] you show up when things are hard you
[3:13:59] show up when things are good
[3:14:03] you show up to praise whether you feel
[3:14:05] like praising or not you show up to pray
[3:14:09] whether you feel like praying or not
[3:14:12] you show up to give whether you feel
[3:14:14] like you can or not
[3:14:17] because it's not the amount
[3:14:21] and somebody says to me I don't have
[3:14:22] anything to give you know what I've told
[3:14:24] them privately if you truly don't have a
[3:14:28] nickel to put in the offering plate pick
[3:14:29] you up a rock on the way in here
[3:14:35] you go get you a pebble
[3:14:38] and you say Lord
[3:14:40] I don't have anything of any monetary
[3:14:43] value
[3:14:44] but I'm bringing this to you because
[3:14:48] I've already seen what you can do with
[3:14:50] The Rock
[3:14:55] God can use a rock he took a giant down
[3:14:58] with a rock
[3:15:00] don't you let the devil talk you out
[3:15:02] don't you let the devil cause you to
[3:15:04] fear or intimidate you because you don't
[3:15:06] have what somebody else has
[3:15:09] but I can't sing like him sing anyway
[3:15:14] well I don't have any rhythm to clap my
[3:15:16] hands clap a little softer
[3:15:21] ah you thought I was going to tell you
[3:15:23] to clap loud anyway I ain't
[3:15:25] because some people are a musician's
[3:15:27] worst nightmare
[3:15:30] but you clap
[3:15:32] I don't care whether I got rhythm or not
