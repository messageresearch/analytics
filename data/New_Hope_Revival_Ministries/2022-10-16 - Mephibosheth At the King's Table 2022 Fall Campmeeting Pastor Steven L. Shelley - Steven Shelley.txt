"And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame.

[Applause] [Music] isn't the Lord Wonderful Tonight I said isn't he wonderful he's wonderful and worthy to be praised you know I I appreciate and understand that our music and our style of worship is a little different than some people are used to and that's okay we we don't mind if you don't mind we're probably not going to change for you and you might not change for us and uh but we just get along pretty good around here don't we we've just had a wonderful meeting but I want you to know I think these are some of the best musicians in the body of Christ I want us to thank them for giving they've just really given and given and given and given [Applause] [Music] praise the Lord thank you you all can go down Mary Beth she played last night we're going into the word so if you can can remain standing do if not we understand but Mary Beth was really fighting sickness and she's been very sick today and she was sick when she came last night but she tested for all the different things and no flu no strep no covet no anything but a cold but she felt so bad but you know what she gave I I sent her husband a text and I said she's a dragon slayer you know to be able to put everything you have into it when you're uh feeling as bad as some folks are feeling well it just it just really is precious and the work these musicians have worked jobs come in no supper just grab a little snack or something in the back and and come out here and and work hard for us and in the sound booth and with the audio video we're just blessed we're just blessed we're just so blessed I want you to pray with me for just a moment before we go into the word and uh there's much to pray about but I have some friends that are walking through a very tight and difficult time right now we have been praying at home and uh the greeleys have been praying and maybe some of the rest of you have seen on social media and maybe you've been praying but it happens to be a family that I have known for many many years and I not only know the parents of this little baby that needs to be healed but I know both sets of grandparents and I know one set of the great grandparents and we have been friends for over 30 years and I want you to lift up the little McGrady baby to the Lord they they knew that there were some problems already and the little baby has been born and they have been able to stabilize her but but she it's a boy excuse me it's a boy isn't it it's a boy the reason I said a girl is because the other the this young man's brother's little girl has been struggling in the hospital also a little baby girl but uh this is the daughter of Ben and Megan McGrady and that is brother Lindsay McGrady's son and his wife and brother Avery and Sister Janet Rourke and then on the other side of the family are the our Bros that we have all known for so many years and this little child needs a miracle to survive they've already been able to stabilize the little fellow and we're just asking the Lord wouldn't it be amazing there are so many people now that know of the condition of that little boy that if God would just come in and and he needs a creative Miracle you know he doesn't just need a touch he's got to have a creative Miracle but I know a God that's creative oh yes we preached last night about God creating frogs if God can create frogs he can create organs again and he can cause little club feet the little child has club feet I want you to know that's nothing hey that's absolutely nothing for the god that we serve and to the last to the last while of brother Perry Green's life he told the testimony over and over and over again you may be seated a moment he told it over and over again we helped to host him in Mobile Alabama some years ago at a large Gathering of Pentecostals and charismatics and he was invited there to give testimony of the ministry of brother William Branham and I wrote in the in the elevator with him and I was with him many times in many places and every time he saw a little child seemed like especially if the little fellow didn't have on a shoe or sock brother green was of another generation and he didn't realize that everybody don't want their baby touched you know there are people that don't want their baby touched you almost better keep them away from us then because we like to touch them brother green he would just reach out I was riding an elevator with him he'd just reach out and take a hold of a stranger's Little Foot strange little babies and just start rubbing his foot and boy that at one time it embarrassed me just a little bit and I thought I hope he's going to tell him why he's rubbing that little baby's foot and about that time he reared back in that big old voice and he said you probably wonder why I'm rubbing your little baby's foot he said every time I see a little naked foot it reminds me of the time that right before my eyes I saw a little club feet that were all malformed and and twisted and brother Branham prayed for this little child I saw it with my own eyes I watched those little feet begin to unfold like a rose petal like a rosebud and little toes begin to form where there had been nothing there little bones begin to come in and I heard the noise I want you to know he had the full attention of this couple that were strangers to him if God did it then don't you know that God is able to do it now you know some of you are looking at me really funny but I want you to know that I believe that in the last move of God for the bride you see there have been revivals everywhere brother Branham said here and there denominational this and and and Full Gospel business means that but he said the bride has never had a Revival yet and he began to speak to us about a quick short work a time that the manifested sons of God quick short not a long period of time but just a short period of time right at the end where God meant aren't we supposed to be praying whoa where God manifests himself in such a profound way by the power of the creative spoken word and the sons of God begin to manifest and they speak with authority and they they change the weather pattern and they raised the Dead and they caused blind eyes to be opened and deaf ears to be unstuck your faith may not be for that but mine is I want you to know I don't serve a God who Fizzles out in the end if that's your theology we don't share an opinion on theology because I don't believe it's in the nature of God to start outstanding and powerful and Brilliant and glorious and then shriek himself so that there's barely anybody with any Victory when the Rapture comes I believe there's there is a company of sons of God in the bride of Christ that are being prepared all over the world in such an hour as this you may not see them you may not know where to find them but I'm telling you for they exist yeah we have allowed our doubt to choke our faith and we need to come to a place I don't know that what God is going to do but I know what he's able to do okay oh King we just got to tell you we're not sure exactly how God's gonna do this we just know we can we just know he's able and one way or another he's going to save and deliver so don't you worry about it it'll be all right now how many of you believe God can touch that child already has already has already has God can touch that little baby boy what is the name my King Josiah Matthew God's able to touch that little boy and give that family a miracle and I want us to pray and I love all the children here and uh they they say I have a favorite and I I'm not going to admit to that publicly in front of everybody because I love them all but there's a little special boy one of these days I'll tell you why I'm not trying to make it spiritual it is spiritual one of these days I'll tell you why I have that kind of a connection with him something the Lord told me when he was being born and and he is dear to me and he was running just a few moments ago a temperature of 105. and they're they're working to get him some help and I want the Lord to touch little Ezekiel tonight I know that God is able so let's go ahead and stand let's take both needs to the Lord let's let our faith turn loose right now and while we're praying we'll pray that the word will come forth tonight and accomplish all that it is sent forth to do that your tiredness will leave you and that you will be just renewed in the spirit so that you can have whatever it is that you've come needing from the Lord tonight let's pray together father we are so thankful for the for the release that comes when we are able to roll our heavy burdens over onto you there is a precious little mama and daddy and grandparents and great-grandparents and Believers all over this nation and perhaps the world that are lifting up little baby Josiah and Lord we stand in agreement with them tonight knowing that there is nothing too hard for you to do I would like to confuse the doctors I'd like to baffle the demons I I would really like to see confusion come to Satan's Camp I would like for you to come into that hospital room Lord and perform a miracle as only you can swear calling on you to release the power of the creative spoken word over that precious little baby oh God do what they say is impossible we lift him up to you right now in the name of Jesus we ask you to touch Ezekiel Joseph right now in the name of the Lord It's not the temperature but it's what causes the temperature that needs to be dealt with Lord Jesus go to the root of that right now and deliver his body many others who are not here tonight because they're fighting various symptoms and various things you're the Healer you're the Healer and you're more than able to heal now I ask you to protect us who are gathered in this house tonight some are fearful because of things they have been through I'm asking you to protect each one we've all come through many cold Seasons together and flu Seasons together and you are more than able to stop these things Hallelujah that they would not go through this body or through those visiting this body we claim our healing come on we claim our healing in the name of Jesus from the top of our head to the souls of our feet many right here need a healing in their body and we look to you Jesus now would you come and help us in your word tonight it would be futile for me to ask you to anoint it it is the anointing your word is anointing it is Anointed but I ask you to anoint our ears to hear and I ask you to anoint your servant to deliver what you have placed in my heart and I will give you glory every one of us will rejoice in you for your God Alone In The Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the church said Psalm 73 if you have your Bible you can look there with me for just a moment and I need your prayers tonight because I want to do exactly what the Lord would have me to do and I want to say exactly what he would have me to say and I've been with him today and I appreciate his presence you're never alone when you have the Lord if you'll just call on him my granny taught me many years ago my precious precious granny taught me many years ago if you ever feel alone if you'll just start saying out loud I love you Jesus I love you Jesus I love you Jesus and mean it from your heart and say it till you do mean it she said I promise you you'll either hear him say or you'll feel him come and give you a witness that he loves you as well and I want you to know in my darkest and most lonely hours when I was watching my mother being beat as a child and when it looked like that she would be killed and there would be nothing that I would be strong enough to do it was in those moments that I would raise my hands in my bedroom and put my hands on the door of the rest of the house and I would pray I love you Jesus I love you Jesus will you help us will you spare my mother's life will you let your presence come into this home will you stop those demon spirits and you know what God spared her again and again and again I want you to know if you'll just tell him I love you I love you Lord I want to give you my heart I want to give you all that I am he'll let you know that he's real do you know he's real Psalm 73 and 1 truly God is good to Israel even to suchest are of a clean heart but as for me this is asaph we give David credit for all the Psalms but this is one of asaph Psalms he said but as for me my feet were almost gone my steps had well not slipped he goes to tell us why for I was envious at the foolish and when I saw the prosperity of the wicked and if we were to read on in in that chapter we would hear him just pouring out his heart I saw the those who committed evil prospering I saw those who had no regard for God and it looked like their life was a bed of ease I'm paraphrasing and mine was struggling and I began to see all of that and the next thing I know my feet were beginning to slip does anybody understand that it'll happen every time when you get your eyes off Jesus if you get your eyes on people you'll always find some slipperiness in your feet but I want you to know in verse 16 he said when I thought to know this it was too painful for me when he began to discover that God had a purpose for his suffering and there was a reason why that it seemed that the wicked were prospering he said when I fought to know this it was too painful for me until I went into the sanctuary of God then understood I their end when I got in the presence of God I began to understand there's a reason for everything this room could not contain the wounds and the pain and the hurt and the losses if we all begin to speak out our life story in here at the same time because we have known some hardship how many of you say I've known some troubles I've known some heartache some of you carrying some of that in here tonight but you are not alone you are not suffering alone everyone around you is care is King as well because we are being beautified glorified Sanctified by what's happening in our lives and one of these days we're going to come forth with that Authority that we were just talking about and I want you to know it's nearer than what you could even imagine and I wouldn't even be surprised if somebody were to raise up in here tonight falling under that full authority of the spoken word we're that close to it amen one of these days we're going to be gathered don't you talk about the restoration of the spoken word god did that a generation ago his word has already been restored he's just waiting on a people that can carry it without prejudice amen he's looking for a people that can carry it without prejudice so that we use it only for the purposes of God and not to build our own kingdom anybody understand we're almost done here he said until I went into the sanctuary of God then I understood therein surely thou did it set them in Slippery places thou casteth them down into destruction My Feet May slip around a little bit on planet Earth but asaph said the slipping I do does not even begin to compare with the slipping that the wicked are going to do in the end because they're going to slip right off into destruction and God who is God who is God who is God is able to establish my feet he's able to strengthen me in the way if you believe that same man you may be seated I feel you now please stay with me I'm not like some I'm begging you I'm I'm not embarrassed I beg you to stay with me please stay with me it's the only way I'll be able to deliver this in in a timely manner and some of you don't have hope for that but have some hope have some hope please have some hope second Samuel chapter 9 verses 3 and 4. I want you to go with me there for just a moment and the King said and the King said is there not yet any of the House of Saul that I may show the kindness of God unto him and Zeba said unto the king Jonathan how many of you remember Jonathan how many of you remember that beautiful brotherly bond between David and Jonathan ah I've heard I've heard the perverted uh people trying to say there was something uh something you know inappropriate how how horrible to say such a thing as that it's to say that that God couldn't give brotherly fraternal affection to one another let me tell you something everybody needs a brother like that everybody needs somebody to go into the trench with you and stand with you in the Foxhole come on that's got your back David and Jonathan had this amazing friendship with one another and uh now Saul is gone and a new king is in place the king that Saul was so jealous of until it almost consumed his very physical form and now he he said I I made a covenant to Jonathan and I made a covenant to Saul do you remember that he covenanted with both of them that he would show kindness to the household of Saul and so he said I I would like to know if there is any yet of the House of Saul that I might show some kindness unto them and Zeba said unto the king Jonathan hath yet a son which is lame on his feet and uh you know uh David well that really pleased him because he really loved Jonathan and he said what a wonderful way for me to keep my Covenant with Jonathan and with Saul I didn't even realize that Jonathan had a son alive why because he had been banished down to lodibar and if you don't know it lodibar was not a desirable place it wasn't like Naples Florida it wasn't like the French Riviera lodibar was a dried up desert Wilderness place and you were if you lived there it was because you were an Untouchable it's because you were not very desirable in society but let me tell you something you because you've spent some time in lodibar doesn't mean you have to be there forever you with me the king said where is he and Zeba said unto the king behold he is in the house of my car the son of Amiel in lodibar now here was a man whose name is not even mentioned here when ziba the servant began to talk to King David he didn't even mention his name he just said he's Jonathan's son and he was known only by his handicap I want you to hear me he was known only by what was wrong with him you ever treated anybody like that we all have somewhere along the way didn't even get a mention of name and and where is this that this was someone from the Royal House of King Saul someone who who should have had some privilege extended to him along the way but but instead because he was crippled in his feet he was banished and he was nearly forgotten how many of you understand his situation are you still with me are you going to keep asking us that I am and don't tell me no stories if you're not just say I wasn't but I'm coming back to you right now he was living in Exile from the King he was filled with rejection and shame and he was living so far below the lifestyle that he deserved he was remembered only because of a covenant that David made with Jonathan and with Saul if you want to mark it down in first Samuel 20 verse 14 and 15 you can read about the Covenant that that David made with Jonathan and if you want to read about the Covenant he made with Saul you can do that in first Samuel chapter 24 verses 20 and 22 and if we had time we would read it but we don't have time for that and I want you to know that David he he decided at some point when the kingdom settled a little bit there had been a whole lot going on in Israel you want to list real quick the nation had split as brother Greeley told us the other night when Saul died David was ruling the southern portion of Israel and Ishmael sheth was reigning in the northern portion and if you'll remember Abner Saul's greatest General would be murdered by joab who was David's greatest General in the gates of Hebron and at some point Ishmael chefs own men murdered him cut off his head and sent it to King David I'm telling you this is a movie in the making this is a bloody mess that is going on and people are vying for power a whole lot is going on and finally after all of this Warfare and bloodshed and fighting for a position David finally came into the United Kingdom 20 years he finally began to rule over both houses 20 years after he had been anointed by the prophet Samuel are you here 20 years so 20 years of waiting is nothing and 30 years of waiting is nothing because if God said it it settles it I said if God said it it settles it you know we say them so often if God said it I believe it it settles it that's right that's how it works in your life you've got to believe it to activate it in your life amen but the truth is even bigger than that if God said it that settles it his word is forever settled in heaven how about squeezing out an amen you you may need one in a minute so squeeze one out as you can so 20 years later David is now in the throne and he must have started relaxing a little bit no one was sending him heads anymore his General wasn't killing somebody else's General and somebody's General wasn't killing his General and my he's just going to relax just a little bit and all of a sudden he's sitting there on the throne one day and he said oh I had a promise I made a vow I made a covenant and I need to start thinking about how I can keep my word I'm just thankful that he remembered his word it's a valuable thing when you say something to do what you say and mean what you say that's integrity whether no one's watching or not God's watching we need to do what we say and so all of a sudden this came to David's heart and he started getting the servants around and I've already read that portion of it to you and you begin to understand in in second Samuel 4 4 let's go there just a moment just getting this part out of the way and Jonathan Saul's son had a son that was lame of his feet he was five years old this is where we're going to begin to learn about the Sun he was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel this is the death of Saul and Jonathan in Jezreel and his nurse who the nurse of the little five-year-old boy the nurse took him up and fled why would she do such a thing as that because she knew that the ones that had killed Saul and Jonathan would now be coming for their entire family and she had the best intention in her heart and that was to protect this little boy so she grabbed up this little five-year-old toddler and she began to make haste and she got in such a hurry that he fell you with me he fell right out of her arms and it was such a severe fall that he became lame and it's here that we learn that his name was mephibosheth say that with me mephibosheth we didn't know his name when we were reading a moment ago but now we know his name and we know how he was lame how he became lame in his feet and we're going to boil this down for you now and we're going to say he's lame because somebody dropped him I want you to say that I really do I want you to just humor me he's lame because somebody dropped him that's the only reason why the only reason why it's crippled is because somebody dropped him in this particular case she didn't mean to drop him she didn't mean to cause him any harm it was an accident but how many of you know that didn't heal his feet the accident didn't change his condition because it happened accidentally didn't make it any easier for him and he spent the rest of his life over there hiding in a place of banishment and in a place of a very simple condition without good food to eat and without proper hygiene he was no more than if he were a leper on the side of the road somewhere forgotten and forsaken why not because he was mentally ill Stay With Me not because he had a brain injury simply because his feet didn't work and why did his feet stop working because somebody dropped him and why did a royal son of a king grandson of a king find himself in this pitiful condition because somebody dropped him right didn't mean to but somebody dropped him now you look at that word lame in the Bible and it's a pretty serious word I don't have time to go to Leviticus 21 but you mark it down Leviticus 21 16-23 will tell you let me just get to one verse here that if you're if you're broken-footed or broken-handed or you have a crooked back or you're a dwarf or you have Stones broken or you have some blemish you cannot be a priest of the most high God neither can you enter in to the most holy place no I didn't don't be mad at me I didn't make that law God did and he did it for a reason so no illegitimate child was allowed in the priesthood nobody who had had some emasculating problem uh an accident or something and lost his ability to procreate he could not even someone who were crippled in their feet perhaps because I have Gaudi arthritis that might be something or I had it let me get that out I had it used to have it long time ago don't even usually call the name but I did for for for effect maybe even I would be because I limp sometime now I limp when I'm tired you see me limping around here in pain or not in pain I just limp it may sometimes be a habit some people say are you hurting and I'll say no am I limping so even that right there could possibly have disqualified me though I was born in a Royal Priestly family that was enough perhaps to keep me from serving in the holiest place pretty sad isn't it I didn't do anything to cause that mephibosheth didn't do anything to cause his feet to be it's a pretty serious thing but remember God has a reason for everything now now mephibosheth's name you might want to mark this down it means contending with shame who named him mephiboshea I'd like to just remind you be careful what kind of name you hang on your children please please please please don't name them after some old rock star please don't name them Elvis please don't name them after some old movie star some old hag out there in the world anybody with me don't name them some demonic name some name of a devil or name of a demon you really want are you are you listening you're the one to hang that Destiny on your children you mean to tell me brother Shelley you really believe that yes and because all through the Bible the spirit would reveal a name and a mom and a daddy would name a child and it would Mark the destiny of that child I know some of you didn't know that when you named your children and so what you need to do is Lay Your Hands on their head and redeem them by the authority of Jesus Christ and if that doesn't work change their name and do it right do it legal so that they didn't have to embarrass them anybody with me now he's named mephibosheth which means contending with shame it also means scattering of Shame so everywhere he went which wasn't many places because he couldn't walk he was carried everywhere he went and this proposed a big problem because he had trust issues punch your neighbor and say you can get a nap tonight don't so sleep now come on I'm gonna wake you up tonight I want you to hear this I really do I want you to hear this he had trust issues wouldn't you have had trust issues the only person you trusted besides your mother was your nurse and your own maid your own nurse the one who was charged to care for you is the one who dropped you she is the one that caused you to be lame she is what the one who caused you to be disqualified from a normal life she's the one that caused you to end up in load a bar with cornbread and a little bit of water or whatever is his meal was and now in order to go somewhere to pay a tax or to do whatever he had to do he had to be carried they didn't have wheelchairs they'd have motor scooters that means every time he had to allow someone to scoop him up like a sack of potatoes and carry him wherever he went and the only reason why it had to be that way is because somebody that he trusted dropped him it's really really sad it's really sad and now his life is filled with shame the one that had been entrusted with his care the one who had probably grown to love him as though he were her own son not on purpose not with malicious intent nevertheless she dropped him now here's the reality Church most of us are you ready for me to name the frogs the verse have been dropped [Music] somebody dropped me oh my this is going to be an encouraging message well we got to get through the reality of why we're limping I want to be able to help you identify your limp so you can get healed tonight I want you to leave here dancing I want you to leave here with victory tonight I want you to know you're not the only one that somebody failed I've been failed I know what it means to be failed I know what it means to be dropped I know what it means to be betrayed but I'm not going to live my life and load a bar I know who I am I know who I am I'm a son of the most high God and I can't live beneath what I know he has given to us can't do it anymore I simply can't do it anymore so we've been failed yes every one of us dropped along the way by someone we trusted someone who was supposed to have our best interest in mind it's going to get a little tough okay now listen it is not my desire to stir your hurts come on I need prayer it is not my desire to stir your hurts or scrape your scars that's not my desire but I find out that sometime if they don't get scraped a little bit and we don't get reminded of them a little bit they identify who we are and you are not to be known by your scars that's not what's going to identify you in this bride's Revival in this move of God you're not going to be known by who dropped you and how you ended up you're not going to be remember where you come from or who you used to answer to you're going to be known as the son of the most high God because before this thing is over you're going to put your feet under the king's table you with me we've been failed by others as many of us have numerous times along the way for some it was not intentional for some it was not on purpose for some it was just like mephibosheth this wasn't a woman who hated him this was a woman who loved him this this was someone who nurtured him but she was she was not capable of protecting him in the moment in that emotional fearful moment that he needed to be protected the most should I ask again are you with me we've been failed by others we need to understand that folks cannot always be what we need them to be or what we want them to be it's not fair but it's life you better quit dwelling in the realm of it's not fair and start understanding Redemption once you get a revelation of redemption and and God's justice and his equity you don't worry about what's fair or not because this is not a promise I'm gonna I'm Gonna Save you and then everything that happens to you is going to be fair but who's to say we base it on our own opinion and our own thoughts anyway don't we we need to understand that folks can't always be what we want them to be or what we need them to be and you've been dropped it might have been apparent it might have been a mother it might have been a father who did not fully provide for all the needs that you would have in life Stay With Me they may have simply not been emotionally capable to meet all of your needs they might not have been they may have come from a similar dysfunction hurt people hurt people broken people break people [Music] dysfunctional people usually help create dysfunction now are you going to spend your life blaming someone who was dysfunctional who was raised in an environment of dysfunction and passed it on are you really going to spend your life hating somebody because you were dropped or are you going to realize that everybody has been dropped in some way or another and we're not comparing my life to your life and your life to my life we're looking to find the Life of Christ now years have passed from your childhood and you are still somehow crippled some of us by the negligence of our parents it might have been more than negligence it could have been physical abuse the ones that should have protected you from violence and harm may have been the very ones that inflicted it on you yes you were dropped you were failed and I'm sincere when I say to you I'm sorry I'm really sorry that should not have happened to you appropriate behavior it could have been that you were scarred from from exposure to sexuality way before you were old enough to even understand what was going on and it might have been apparent I don't have words I don't have words I don't understand it I can't explain it I can only tell you I'm so sorry I can only tell you but I'm I'm getting ahead of myself to do it but I got to now for a moment I can only tell you he Bears all of our burdens he heals all of our wounds he carries on he he has bomb I'm telling you I don't have anything for sale tonight I'm not trying to sell you anything I'm telling you what I believe with all my heart he has a bombshell he has a healing bomb like no other that he can rub on your wound why hadn't he already done it have you let him have you been vulnerable in his presence have you really or or have you done what most of us do pushed it down pushed it down and pushed it down because you didn't want to face the the pain and The Agony and the fear that comes you've just pushed it down have you really ever laid it out before him and set my feet are lame because somebody dropped me and I don't want to live I've got to have help maybe someone exposed you maybe someone touched you maybe a parent maybe there were other forms of abuse I'm so sorry that was more than enough to cause you to be a little crippled to cause you to be a little lame I'm so sorry might have been an ex-husband ex-wife who hurt you to the Core with their infidelity that sick anguishing feeling that still runs deep in your soul the bitter sting of betrayal hurt worse than if you would would have had to endure a physical blow it could be that you have never bounced back from all the lies it could be that you have never really learned to trust anybody because of being dropped maybe it was verbal abuse maybe you were called stupid maybe you were called a failure maybe you were told by your own parents you'd never amount to anything you know even Christian parents can be abusive you don't have to strike your child in Anger to be abusive and just let me be sure to say here that I believe in corporal punishment and my children were all disciplined that way but not in anger it was used to train because we have a responsibility to train our children not beat them into compliance may I also say that God In His Infinite Wisdom gave a child some extra padding in the most appropriate place where they sit and even some people have misused the force and applied it in a way that was far too severe for the crime and maybe you were even in a situation where you took it for other siblings because there was no fairness in your home maybe your parents didn't understand that that your your gluteus maximus your hind end is where that kind of punishment not your arm not your hand not your face not your shoulder not your back not your leg maybe they didn't know that a slap provokes anger and Brokenness and it does absolutely nothing to train a child to do right it only causes them to fear the parent and you're never ever going to be able to make any inroads with a child that fears you to that extent you may have been the victim it's quiet you may have been the victim of that and I'm sorry my mother whipped me excessively because she was a broken and angry person problem is I needed it probably from time to time but there's something about that SWAT that stirs up all that emotion in a broken person and they're not able to gauge sometime or measure how much is enough how much how much pressure is enough and how much is abusive so I know what it means for the blood to run and I know what it means to carry marks and bruises and I'm not angry with my mother I realize that she was disciplining the best that she could but in so many ways my mama Who Loved Me dropped me my dad rejected me early he dropped me but I'm no longer angry I understand I want you to understand the bitter sting of betrayal and infidelity and marriage hurt worse than it would have if you would have had to endure a physical blow maybe it was a verbal abuse that reshaped and redefine who you really were they're women sitting in this room who don't even know who they are because they have become questions so reshaped and reformed by the hate-filled words that have been spoken over them by someone who professed to love them somebody got dropped you've been left a little handicapped and unable to fully function like others around you it may have been a pastor it might have been a preacher who wounded you so deeply that you've never fully recovered from the blow maybe he betrayed your confidence or God forbid maybe he made advances toward you or someone else in the church there are kids in this room who have been are adults in this room who are abused by men of God maybe it was another kind of church hurt that dropped you along the way a bitter split or a debilitating Financial betrayal maybe too many times you found yourself the subject of vicious gossip and innuendos in a church if so there's no wonder why you struggle to trust anyone you were dropped perhaps it was another kind of situation in life a setback in a business a loss of a career a troubling health problem a partner who went back on his word maybe it was the loss of someone dear in a time when you felt like you needed them the most some of you lost your parents and your grandparents at such an early and vulnerable age that it has affected your life I could not possibly take the time or have the mind to be able to think of all the scenarios that are represented in this room and by those streaming this service but I stand confidently to say you were dropped and the one thing I do know is that it was not your fault that you were dropped nonetheless it has affected you and some of us are still paying the price today for those who failed us some want nothing to do with church because of church hurts some want nothing to do with family because a family hurts come on some want nothing to do with marriage because of marriage hurts you may be the smartest of us all no it doesn't have to be that way it just simply doesn't have to be that way so whatever whoever whichever it's very likely that everyone in this room at some time or another was dropped and it has affected your walk it has affected your life I'm not going to ask you to raise your hand but I'm going to I'm going to ask you to nod your head or say Amen or or do something if you can acknowledge tonight that in some way you were failed you're not casting Stones you're not you're not throwing off on someone else you're just being honest and you're just saying I was dropped I've been failed I've been hurt I've been wounded I've been affected by it I think it's good to own it I think it's good to admit it I think it's good to confess it I think it's good to deal with it I think it's good to let God come and do something for us before we go home tonight come on now so finally one day the king he said is there anybody that I can show kindness to because of this Covenant that I made and the answer came from Zeba the servant he said oh yes he said there's a son who is lame it's a difficult thing with most people look at how Zeba answered back he's got a son he's crippled no mention of his name no mention of his potential value no mention of any hope no mention of any strengths he may have been a genius a prodigy but nothing of that was mentioned only a son who is lame simply just a man with a terrible problem and you have felt that way before in your life probably I'm just a man with a problem I'm just a woman with a problem I'm just a person with scars but I want to tell you something tonight that where Zeba saw a problem David noted a person where Zeba found the deficiency David saw Grace where Zeba so red flags and raised them high David saw green lights this is my opportunity where Zeba shows a handicap David said there ought to be some healing available and that's the way so is where the enemy sees you and defines you by your scars God sees beyond he sees you as you really are some of you have been dropped because of of addiction somebody showed you how to shoot it up how to snort it how to get it I've been in Revival meetings where junkies and suppliers got saved if a junkie is going to get delivered is a good idea for his supplier to get delivered [Applause] you've been dropped I know of situations just like that and they hurt no matter how crippled you may be I'm here tonight to tell you in the minutes I have left there's a king who's looking for you I want you to know that there's a king who's looking for you and he will not just see your broken feet you're more than a handicap to him you're more than a scar to him you're more than a broken one to him you're more than an Untouchable to him the king is seeking you out he'll scour the ends of the Earth there's no wall that he won't knock down there's no mountain he won't Climb come on there's no distance that he will not run coming after you [Applause] he's after you he wants you he knows more about you than anybody could possibly know and he still is after you he knows your warts he knows your pimples he knows your crooked nose he sees your varicose veins [Applause] he sees your bat wings your muffin top he sees it all and instead of Loving You Less he's chasing you more with a greater passion because he wants to change some things he wants to show you there's a place to put your feet help me help me no matter how crippled you may be no matter how handicapped you may be no matter how affected you may be by the pain in the abuse of your life you cannot forget tonight that there's a king and I want you to show him second Samuel 9 7. oh hallelujah oh it's just 8 15 but we're not we started out early whoa and David said unto him fear not for I will surely show thee kindness somebody had to tote him all the way from lodibar to the Palace somebody had to knock on the door he huddles in the corner and say today your number has been called today mephibosheth you've won the lottery of lotteries today mephibosheth your destiny is going to change forever because the king is calling the king the king the king is calling me do you think he was anxious to go no no because it was the custom in the exchanging of a kingdom that one king and his court would often seek out the descendants of a prior King and Kill Them All so here is mephiboshea shaking in his socks the king is calling me I thought I had ran far enough and he had long enough that I had been forgotten I thought that maybe he would show me mercy because of my handicap and would let me live out the rest of my years in this little hole in the wall but all you're here to tell me the king is calling for me yes yes the king is calling for you so when he starts getting the message he gets brought I will certainly have to skip quite a bit but this is what David says to him fear not for I will surely show thee kindness are you with me for Jonathan thy father's sake listen to this and we'll restore the all the land of Saul thy father that's a big Kingdom but you know what I think is more precious than land because if you've got crippled feet you're not doing a whole lot of walking not sure what a lot of value land course we know that land was valuable and there was money and and so forth we get all that but here's what I like you shall eat bread at my table continually now the king often had banquets but that's not what he was inviting him to he was inviting him to The Family Table he was inviting him for breakfast and for lunch and for dinner and for midnight snacks we don't have a delivery service down in lodibar so I'm gonna have to bring you up here and put you right in the palace you understand that a man who was hopeless and a man who was broken and a man who thought he would spend the rest of his life rejected and dejected and broken and shamed and made fun of it even his name meant shame has now been carried on the back of somebody all the way to the Palace and David has now said you you that hole in the wall down there that somebody let you live in I'm giving you the land that belonged to Saul your father and you will eat bread at my table continually it was a long way from load a bar lodibar means desolation dryness poverty and bitterness be careful the spirit that's over where you live come on be careful as much as possible be careful because the only thing the lame man got down in lodibar was stale bread from yesterday and he was forced to drink the tepid water from a muddy cistern but now he's going to be drinking from an overflowing well in the king's Palace lodavar was a place where you feed on crumbs anger crumbs and bitterness crumbs and jealousy crumbs and Malice crumbs and negative Faith crumbs and feel sorry for myself crumbs that I'm just a martyr and everybody hates me and nobody loves me and I'm gonna just eat worms but you don't have to eat those crumbs because the king is calling you out of lodibar you don't have to be identified by your abuse or associated with your abuser he's giving you an address change Hallelujah you felt like a dead dog and now you can feel like a son of the king he had to listen he had to deal with the fear of meeting the king he had to deal with all the trust issues because folks you can only use those excuses and that's what I'm going to call them because that's what I believe they become they're not excuses in the beginning they're they're the wise they're the wise but once you get an invitation to the King's house and his table if you choose to remain in lodibar then you're making excuses because God is offering you something far better than a life of addiction because many people are trying to drown their scars in alcohol or with a pill or with a or with pot or whatever else they use these days and the truth is there's something to offer you that's far better than any of those things it's a life of freedom in Jesus Christ oh hallelujah what a different atmosphere what a different atmosphere than the king in second Samuel 9 9 the king called the Zeb us all servant I want the musicians to come the king called the Zeb us all servant and said unto him I've given unto thy Master son all that pertained to Saul and his house let me ask you a question is anybody lame in this place tonight has anybody been dropped I said I wasn't going to ask you to raise your hand then I didn't I am now has anybody have been dropped in this place put your hand up if you will or you failed somewhere along the way do you feel like you you feel like the scars are you can't hide them the truth is some scars can be hidden and some are just so obvious that they can't be hidden but I want you to know there's a place there's a place where all scars can be hidden and the pain of our past can be forgotten because despite our lameness we're invited to the king's table because of a covenant that's higher that's more powerful that is eternal it's greater than the Covenant that David made with Jonathan and it's greater than the Covenant that David made with Saul it's the Covenant that Jesus made as our savior and our Messiah and he signed and sealed it with his own blood and delivered it to us in his resurrection and he not only said I want to live with you he went so far as to say I want to live in you I want to go where you go sit where you sit and walk where you walk I want a place who I am in you I want to fill you with my spirit so that you are never alone you see once mephibosheth stuck his feet under the king's table he looked like everybody else only when he got out from under the king's table that anybody knew he had a handicap so you know what my advice to you is keep your feet under his table [Applause] don't let the charms and the allures of this old world cause you to forsake Christ out there you'll be identified by where you come from and what your name is but under the king's table when you place your feet there your royalty the ground is level I wish I had some help the ground is level at the foot of the cross the rich and the poor stand side by side but broken in the hole stand side by side be educated and the uneducated stand side by side those who came from pristine lives and pristine backgrounds they stand right beside some of us in this place tonight who had parents to drop us and spouses to drop us and preachers to drop us and churches to fail us yes yet when we put our feet under the master's table there's no room to talk about where we've been or what has happened to us we're all so overwhelmed with the joy to be sitting at his table feasting continually on the bread that he provides am I making any sense at all tonight you're given an inheritance that you didn't deserve and that you didn't earn and that you could have never been worthy of but he made me Worthy and now by his grace his Mercy has made me his own you said I grew up in religion I'm not ashamed of where I come from I am who I am today because of where I walked but I grew up in religion and I grew up in quite a bit of legalism and it wasn't because we were encouraged to dress a certain way or do a certain thing I actually believe in standards and I believe if you don't have a standard and you look exactly like the rest of the world and live exactly like the rest of the world then you're not really being any kind of light at all so I believe in holiness I believe in modesty I believe in distinction between the genders you may be confused but God's not confused he knew what Plumbing to give you when he when he allowed you to be born he's not confused but I grew up in an environment where we never could quite feel Worthy and it seems like everything was designed to keep us in this state I don't think it was I think it was more ignorance than anything and lack of Revelation but it was almost like everything was designed to keep us feeling beat down and unworthy so that we would love Jesus folks that's the wrong kind of theology I've never grown in him because I realized I was unworthy what makes me grow is when I realized that he found me in my unworthiness and nothing that I could do would make me Worthy can I just get real personal you know a woman could have hair that touches the ground and she could she could have the uniform and do all the things exactly like like she should do and never even be born again because godliness doesn't start on the outside it starts on the inside [Applause] you ought to clap for that it's truth you're not coming for me it's true it's it's like I've told you and I'll I'll close here in a minute but it's like I've told you before well five minutes before the fire of God fell on the bush it was an ordinary bush Mr Bush what kind of bush a bush must have been a beautiful book it was a bush Guster bush I I I mean I it might have been an ugly bush might have been no berries no blooms hardly any leaves I just kind of think it was probably the most ordinary looking Bush on the mountain nobody would have cut it down and well you know what people do you know what heathens do nobody would have decked it out and nobody would have dug and put in a pot and made it a a house plant isn't that what they call them now house plants another trend there have been people loving plants forever and now now now they're house plants people get all excited about them I don't think this was a special bush it was a very ordinary bush but all of a sudden oh I felt that all of a sudden God God came down in the pillar of fire he had before God came down in that Pillar of Fire and you know what he did he crawled up in that bush and in in five seconds the most ordinary ugly unworthy Bush on the mountain now became a holy bush a bush that was holier than all the other bushes on that mountain why because God called in chat wow let me tell you what makes you holy it's not our actors and don'ts and we have them and we always will but it's not our do's and don'ts that make us holy it is not what we wear or we don't wear that makes us holy the thing that causes you to be holy is that God himself has chosen to live inside of you he placed more than the pillar of fire on you he rescind to what he was and he placed that he plunged that very essence into Who You Are he made you holy he made you worthy that's what the blood does that's what the life of Jesus Christ does if you believe that clap for Jesus [Applause] Hallelujah [Applause] so I want to say to you in closing we have this treasure in Earthen vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us if he would have given us all pristine lives mamas who always did it right daddies who always did it right husbands that always nurtured us riding wives that always treated us right and pastors who always did the right thing and churches who were perfect if God would have given us all of those things we would have not appreciated fully what Mercy means what Grace means what a privilege it is did you know the Bible said you have not chosen me but I have chosen you saith the Lord he saw your scars he saw your crippled feet he saw all the things that you went through and those who carried you well and those who dropped you you are a combination a conglomeration of those who loved you well and those who loved you poorly that's who you are tonight your boasting cannot be in a beautiful life that knows no pain or no sorrow or no heartache or no betrayal your boasting cannot be anything of you of your doing of your families doing of your church is doing if you have anything to boast of tonight it must be in the one who loved you who gave everything for you and who is calling you tonight rise house the king is inviting you to place your feet under his tables you say brother you're giving altar call for Sinners not exactly I'm giving an altar call for everybody in the room whether you walk up this way or whether you don't walk up this way I want you to know it's not only those without a savior that need to realize but there are many many children of God who attend every service who pay their tithes who have never been able to reconcile the scars the betrayals the drops the years that preachers stood between you in truth across this world the pulpit is full of men who know better it'll get real quiet now but they have chosen to conceal the truth there are very few people that believe God's three people they can't read the Bible I read and think such a thing very few people believe that they know better than that they're always looking back to niacia we're not to be looking back to Nico or be we're supposed to be looking unto Jesus there was a truth of God established in the word before there was a nicean council before there was Apostles Creed there was a gospel message that delivers and sets free many churches know that the right baptism is not in the name of titles many churches know that because they're Scholars and they've studied the word but they can't afford to tell you the truth because the denomination will kick them out of the movement and they'll take their license and they won't have a Pulpit and nobody will have come there are people that are that are around this message that know the gifts are not finished they know that this message came to restore all that Pentecost was and carry us into another place in the depths of the word but it was not to take away the fire it was not to take away the spirit it was not to steal the supernatural away from us and many know it and yet they stand in the way keeping their p and I want to tell you something and I don't mean to boast but they won't preach a message like this because they wouldn't know what to deal with the mess it creates I know tonight it's going to sound boastful forgive me I know what to do I know what to do I got to put your hand in his hand that's all I got to do I can't fix you I can't heal you I can't save you I can barely help you folks but if I can put your hand in his hand I'm telling you there's a man there's a man in here there's a man in the air [Applause] who can turn on the lights and he's calling you he's calling you before Michelle to put your feet under his table whoa his table covers all the hurts all the abuse the first thing I want you to do when you get there and you settle down a little bit like David settled down and he remembered his promise I want to tell you her True Deliverance comes from those who hurt you the most when you get to the place or you can pray for them uh I don't mean them prayers you got women way too quick I want to make sure you understand that I'm not talking about them blessing bless them Lord I hope they fall off the porch and break their neck bless them Lord I know what church witchcraft is I've been around some of that Unholy intercession I don't want none of that I'll never be satisfied until they pay for what they've done thank you Jesus folks you may not be where you can relax yet you may only see your feet and how broken they are and no matter how hard you try to forget the person that dropped you they may be all you see sometime and you may not be ready to pray for them but I want to encourage you that as soon as you get to that place forgive why because he forgave us he forgave us well yeah but I didn't do anything to him you didn't you put him there I put him there don't tell me we didn't do anything to him we put him there it was not his sin he died for whoa that ought to make you shout why that ought to make a Baptist Shout that ought to make anybody Shout he went there to pay for my sin I sinned that put him there and yet he forgave me Father forgive them if he could forgive those that drove the nails in his hands and feet and thrust the crown of orange on his head somebody said oh but that's Jesus that's why you've got to understand who he is [Music] he could have called Ten Thousand Angels with one word he could have not only destroyed his enemies he could have destroyed the whole world hanging there suspended between Earth and Glory before he experienced kenosis when the spirit eternal spirit of the father left him there to die alone as the scripture tells us before that happened he could have destroyed the whole world but the prophet of the Old Testament tells us why he didn't because he saw his seed scripture says he saw his seed you know when I look across this room find something I don't know who's leading who's who's getting ready just tell me who's leading Chad who someone when I look across this room tonight I see a seed to me you're not defined by what you've been through because frankly I don't even know what all you've been through and those I do to me you're none of those things you didn't deserve them they shouldn't have happened but the only way that it could be him and not some goodness on our part we had to wait our way through some stuff we had to experience some Darkness we had to carry a little bit of pain none of it compares to his suffering on our behalf and he's calling for you tonight whether you consider yourself in Christ are not yet in Christ he's calling to you refuse to be defined by the drop stick your feet under the master's table it's bread drink his water and see what love can accomplish many of us need Deliverance because we have become the manifestation of our pain and we're living the reality of what we've been through instead of living a life of Victory and freedom and deliverance but he has power to deliver us tonight you don't need to fall on the ground you don't have to have somebody lay hands on your head all you have to do is believe that he's able to do what I've preached he could do tonight all it takes to have that kind of help and that kind of touch is to reach out to him let's stand he was there that's way too low for me [Music] the time he was there oh the time let's come and worship him if you if you feel like you're a mephibosheth if you feel like you need some deliverance and some help bring your lane seed up here bring your handicap up here call on the Lord don't let anything keep you from responding to him he was there [Music] coming closer would you say that if we don't make room then there's some that are so far away preacher I was dropped [Music] I got some scars [Music] but I want to give them to Jesus tonight he was there all the time he was there sing it out all the time he did not leave you [Music] completing me he was waiting patiently for you to hear his invitation [Music] saw you down in ludibar he sent somebody to bring you to the Palace he wants to give you an inheritance that was not yours [Music] David didn't have to give anything that belonged to Saul to mephibosheth the inheritance was not his chose to give him an inheritance that he didn't deserve the king is choosing the night to give you an eye an inheritance and we didn't deserve and all he's asking is under my table let me cover your scars let me give you what I have to offer sing it again he was there oh [Music] are there others who want to come and get some help oh [Music] in life he was there I want you to sing it again I want you to remember he was there he was there he was

tell him what you want him to do you say Lord I'm here to put my feet under your table come on I can't do this for you I've done my part tonight the best I could it's going to be up to you to give it to him but I'm going to stand here and agree with you right now that you'll have all the faith you need to cast it on him Jesus he was there [Music] oh he was there all the time I didn't call you up

said I'll feed you continually I'll provide your breakfast your lunch and your dinner I believe that's what he wants to do for you right now I saw you responding to the spirit and that's what drew me to you so go ahead and let him do it let him cover the scars on your feet let him give you Grace to turn it loose you know those who dropped you you know what you've gone through you know what your

God we didn't come that far enough to get a little touch from the Lord we've made a big sacrifice to be here oh sorry brother my understanding is that you were uh at uh what you call your grandmother a house what do you call her what do you call Sister Nana if you were there with your family and you saw a stream you saw part of a stream of our service do you remember that and did you I think they told me you wanted to know why you'd never visited this church or why you never knew about this church and you wanted to come and the enemy tried to talk you out of it and you kind of lost the desire to be here but somehow you made it and I knew the first time I looked at you that you were supposed to be here for a reason for a reason purpose and you did too so let's just ask the Lord to reveal that purpose in your life Hallelujah father in the name of Jesus Lord you see this precious young man far too precious for the filthy world around him far too valuable for the filthy world around him I pray o God that right now you will come to take and claim what is yours saw him before the foundation of the world before he was formed in his mother's womb he was yours you had a purpose for his life and you brought him this place not by accident but to show him who you are I pray tonight that every wound every scar those moments of rejection those moments of feeling failed and let down those moments of feeling not as important as someone or something else those times of even being brushed aside I pray tonight they land under your table because that is not who he is in the name of Jesus let your blood redeem this life and use him for the kingdom of God consume him with a desire for the things of God may his life never be the same again Jesus come in come in right now Lord ask him little brother just say Jesus come in come into my life fill me with who you are you've come this far you might as well go the rest of the way fill me with who you are may she never be the same May the things of this world lose their value may they they dim in his vision may he have a desire for the things of God may he be used for his own family I know that's a heavy weight to lay on you but I
