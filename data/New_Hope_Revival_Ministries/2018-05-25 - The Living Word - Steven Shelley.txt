TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Jesus wants to live in you manifesting the same works the same power the same Authority the same spirit it's going to require that same spirit fill to overflowing with the same spirit that lived in that body of our precious Lord that broken beaten bloody body of our Lord and this is the gift of God this is the continuation of the journey the Lord as we know him the word is spirit form he came in a body but now he lives inside of us in a spirit form and so how do we know more of him how do we fellowship him how do we build relationship with him we can't see him he's inside of us by the Holy Spirit how do we build a relationship we do it in the spirit because if we have the right spirit and the right attitude concerning the Word of God whether it's what we read or what's delivered to us by teaching or preaching our prophetic utterance if we have the right attitude and spirit toward that word then we open up and we receive it with faith and when we open up to God's Word and we receive truth by faith we study we pray we we connect verse to verse then that revelation expands on the inside of us as we agree with God's Word as we join our faith with God's Word in fact the Scriptures indicate that the more time we spend thinking about the word abiding in that word adding our faith to it then the more revelation we will receive from that word you can't hear a sermon on Sunday and and never reconsider it and expect that that word you heard is going to make a difference in your life I do believe that there's power in hearing the Word of God but I don't think that's just letting it register in the ear I think that hearing is letting it register in the heart [Music]
