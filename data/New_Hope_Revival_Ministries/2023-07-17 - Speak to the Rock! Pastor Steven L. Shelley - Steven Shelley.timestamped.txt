[53:54] makes the demons tremble it's the life
[53:59] behind the name that makes the proud art
[54:05] humble it was God who defies
[54:10] that in all things as a man
[54:16] so he could give to us the life behind
[54:20] the name oh it's the life behind the
[54:25] name that makes the demons tremble in a
[54:32] life behind behind the name
[54:35] that makes the proud part humble it was
[54:40] God who devised the plan that in all

[54:52] life behind

[55:34] name of Jesus Christ
[55:36] Hallelujah
[55:39] oh yes
[55:44] it's the life you may be seated just a
[55:47] moment we're so happy to see you in the
[55:49] house of the Lord and his presence is
[55:52] here
[55:53] and uh you know I I just was looking
[55:57] around the room this morning and of
[55:59] course there's some missing and God sent
[56:01] some extra visitors in here to make up
[56:04] for that and we appreciate that so much
[56:07] but I was just thankful I just felt some
[56:10] overwhelming thankfulness
[56:13] to be able to Pastor a group of people
[56:16] I've been streaming some other services
[56:18] lately
[56:19] is trying to take the temperature
[56:22] of what's happening in other places
[56:24] because God's moving everywhere
[56:26] everywhere his bride is gathered
[56:28] together he's moving
[56:30] but it makes me very very thankful for
[56:33] you
[56:37] I want you to know that I'm very very
[56:39] thankful for you
[56:41] I'm thankful because I see so many
[56:43] worship services around the the world
[56:46] where where the song leader does all the
[56:48] singing
[56:49] doesn't that make it a concert
[56:52] I'm so thankful to have a group of
[56:54] people who sing
[56:56] you know you're building an atmosphere
[56:58] for the Lord to come in and help you
[57:02] you're you're you're doing it to glorify
[57:04] him but but there's a little element of
[57:07] that that's just slightly self-serving
[57:09] because when we build an atmosphere of
[57:12] Faith around our lives he'll come and
[57:14] speak to our needs
[57:16] is that right so I know we have various
[57:20] uh forms genres of music We Sing old
[57:23] hymns we sing newer pray I'm not one of
[57:26] those who believes that if a song was
[57:28] written uh in the past 30 years that
[57:31] it's not good
[57:34] I happen to believe that the same
[57:36] anointing that was anointing songwriters
[57:38] in the 50s
[57:40] is still anointing songwriters today
[57:43] and just because it doesn't appear in
[57:46] the only believe book doesn't mean you
[57:49] know there's nothing there's no church
[57:51] order on that particularly
[57:53] and I like the fact that I I look around
[57:56] and I see the seniors and they're
[57:58] singing with the same enthusiasm a newer
[58:02] song
[58:03] with the same worship
[58:06] making out the words when we can get
[58:09] them up fast enough
[58:10] and not not judging the song or you know
[58:15] just entering in and and I want to thank
[58:18] you that the worship leader here doesn't
[58:20] have to constantly Tell You Raise Your
[58:22] Hands Say Amen praise the Lord you've
[58:27] come for that
[58:29] that is why we've come we've come to
[58:31] hear the word but we have come to
[58:34] worship the King of Kings and the Lord
[58:37] of lords that's why we were here I don't
[58:40] want to say this for the visitors we we
[58:42] should keep this quiet but this is why
[58:45] we were here four and a half hours last
[58:47] Sunday
[58:49] don't panic
[58:51] we got it out
[58:54] we got it out we may not have to be here

[1:08:16] was
[1:08:18] night
[1:08:20] open all at once there was a Feeling

[1:13:33] I want to go to Exodus chapter 16 and we
[1:13:37] want to thank God for the musicians and
[1:13:39] the backup singers and the cameraman and
[1:13:43] the sound men and the projector lady and
[1:13:49] everything that you're doing God bless
[1:13:52] all of you God bless you Brother Juan
[1:13:54] from from Cape Town thank you God bless
[1:13:58] you all from Ghana
[1:14:00] and and across this nation from Iceland
[1:14:04] and we're going to be praying for
[1:14:06] brother Hawk and Sister Mary Beth at the
[1:14:08] end of the service and their children as
[1:14:10] they'll be leaving tomorrow for a month
[1:14:12] in Iceland to be used of the Lord in
[1:14:16] whatever way he would desire to use them
[1:14:18] and then God willing if everything comes
[1:14:21] together for us we will be leaving in a
[1:14:24] couple weeks to join them and my wife
[1:14:27] and I will spend a couple weeks there
[1:14:29] doing some Ministry work and enjoying
[1:14:32] the beauty of Iceland I don't know it's
[1:14:35] about my ninth trip or something like
[1:14:37] that I'm not sure exactly how many but
[1:14:41] it's a wonderful place where there's a
[1:14:43] small group of Believers that love the
[1:14:44] Lord and love the word it's the
[1:14:47] strangest thing in all the world here's
[1:14:49] the people that don't generally have
[1:14:51] televisions in their home and and the
[1:14:54] only Christian Network in Iceland is
[1:14:56] owned by a message believer
[1:14:59] and God's using that he's using that
[1:15:01] he's used it many times through the
[1:15:03] years and this truth has been presented
[1:15:07] through the years and we don't know what
[1:15:10] all God's going to do but he's going to
[1:15:11] do some amazing things yet in the
[1:15:14] ministry in Iceland do you believe that
[1:15:16] I believe that with all my heart you all
[1:15:19] have met brother Erickson most of you
[1:15:21] have and and you know that he's a man of
[1:15:25] integrity in a man that loves the word
[1:15:27] and God's using him
[1:15:29] and so let's be sure to remember to pray
[1:15:31] for them and I I won't take time to to
[1:15:35] mention the rest of the streamers but
[1:15:37] they're all over the world thank you so
[1:15:39] much for being with us
[1:15:40] Exodus chapter 16.
[1:15:43] beginning in verse 2.
[1:15:48] are you ready for the word
[1:15:51] and the whole Congregation of the
[1:15:54] children of Israel murmured against
[1:15:57] Moses and Aaron in the wilderness
[1:16:01] and the children of Israel said unto
[1:16:04] them what did God we had died by the
[1:16:08] hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt
[1:16:11] when we sat by the flesh pots and when
[1:16:15] we did eat bread to the full for ye have
[1:16:19] brought us forth into this Wilderness to
[1:16:23] kill this whole assembly with hunger
[1:16:27] then said the Lord unto Moses behold I
[1:16:31] will reign bread from heaven for you and
[1:16:35] the people shall go out and gather a
[1:16:37] certain rate every day that I may prove
[1:16:40] them whether they will walk in my law or
[1:16:45] no
[1:16:46] now would you go to Exodus chapter 17
[1:16:49] let me read one more place and then you
[1:16:53] can have your seat
[1:16:55] eight verses and all the congregation of
[1:16:58] the children of Israel journeyed from
[1:17:01] the Wilderness of sin after their
[1:17:04] Journeys according to the Commandment of
[1:17:06] the Lord and pitched in rephedim and
[1:17:10] there was no water for the people to
[1:17:13] drink so they hungered for bread and God
[1:17:15] provided bread didn't he do it and now
[1:17:18] they're thirsty they need something to
[1:17:21] wash the bread down with it seems and so
[1:17:24] they are they're again in need wherefore
[1:17:27] the people did chide with Moses and said
[1:17:31] give us water that we may drink and
[1:17:35] Moses said unto them why chide ye with
[1:17:38] me they weren't just requesting moisture
[1:17:41] they were mockingly
[1:17:43] pressing him and agitating him
[1:17:47] are you going to help me
[1:17:49] they they were you know on his on his
[1:17:52] hand like we were speaking of Tuesday
[1:17:54] night just coming back and back give us
[1:17:57] water that we may drink and Moses said
[1:18:00] unto them why child ye with me wherefore
[1:18:02] do ye tempt the Lord
[1:18:05] and the people thirsted there for water
[1:18:08] and the people murmured against Moses
[1:18:11] and said wherefore is this that thou
[1:18:15] Hast brought us up out of Egypt to kill
[1:18:18] us and our children and our cattle with
[1:18:22] Earth weren't they just asking to die
[1:18:26] now they're upset because they're
[1:18:28] thirsty and Moses Cried unto the Lord
[1:18:31] saying what shall I do unto this people
[1:18:34] they'd be almost ready to Stone me and
[1:18:39] the Lord said unto Moses go on before
[1:18:42] the people and take with thee of the
[1:18:44] Elders of Israel and thy rod wherewith
[1:18:48] thou smodus the river take in thine hand
[1:18:52] and go
[1:18:53] behold I will stand before thee there
[1:18:57] upon the rock in Horeb and thou shall
[1:19:01] Smite The Rock and there shall come
[1:19:04] water out of it that the people may
[1:19:09] drink and Moses did so in the sight of
[1:19:13] the Elders of Israel
[1:19:16] Smite The Rock and what happened the
[1:19:20] water began to flow out of the rock he
[1:19:23] called the name of the place Masa and
[1:19:25] maribba because of the chiding of the
[1:19:29] children of Israel and because they
[1:19:32] tempted the Lord saying is the Lord
[1:19:35] among us or not then came amalek and
[1:19:40] fought with Israel in referedim now Lord
[1:19:44] we thank you for your word today you
[1:19:48] have told us in the newer Covenant in
[1:19:51] the New Testament that everything that
[1:19:54] happened to Israel happened as in
[1:19:57] samples to us there is much that we who
[1:20:02] are the partakers of Grace can
[1:20:05] understand by looking at those who were
[1:20:09] under the law so Lord we asked today
[1:20:12] that you anoint our ears to hear your
[1:20:15] word and that you anoint your servant to
[1:20:18] give forth your word as for your word it
[1:20:21] is Anointed it is life it is truth it is
[1:20:25] God it is the written record of who you
[1:20:28] are and so now Lord we ask that any
[1:20:31] hindrance would be put down among us
[1:20:33] even now and that there would be Liberty
[1:20:36] to deliver what you have placed on my
[1:20:39] heart and I will thank you and this
[1:20:41] people will praise you for your special
[1:20:44] Grace To Us in the name of the Lord
[1:20:47] Jesus Christ we pray and the church said
[1:20:51] amen you may be seated
[1:20:53] we were speaking recently about
[1:20:58] transitioning from one phase to another
[1:21:03] phase I don't know if you remember it's
[1:21:05] been a few weeks ago now we we talked
[1:21:08] about this John excuse me Revelation
[1:21:12] chapter 10 where John is told to eat the
[1:21:18] book now if anybody needs to understand
[1:21:21] the metaphor it means he was told to
[1:21:24] take that scroll and to eat it and and
[1:21:28] he did and uh I don't want to say if it
[1:21:32] was physical or spiritual but what I do
[1:21:34] know is that exactly what the Lord spoke
[1:21:37] to him would happen the angel said is
[1:21:40] exactly what happened it was sweet in
[1:21:43] his mouth like honeycomb and then it
[1:21:47] moved down into his belly and it gave
[1:21:49] him bitter belly syndrome do you
[1:21:51] understand what I'm saying his stomach
[1:21:54] began to boil just as soon as that word
[1:21:57] began to go down that scroll began to go
[1:22:00] down and he began to digest what was in
[1:22:03] that open book that open scroll and so
[1:22:06] we understand that when things begin to
[1:22:09] move around in the stomach something is
[1:22:12] going to happen and the next verse says
[1:22:15] to John and you must do what
[1:22:19] prophesy again for what you have taken
[1:22:23] into your spirit man your your spiritual
[1:22:26] womb it's now stirring in you there's
[1:22:30] some bitterness involved it's going to
[1:22:32] cost you something to eat the revealed
[1:22:34] word let me just say it's going to cost
[1:22:37] you something to eat this scroll the
[1:22:40] revelation of Jesus Christ is a costly
[1:22:43] meal amen the church doesn't want much
[1:22:45] to do with it because it's not
[1:22:47] necessarily politically correct and it's
[1:22:51] not necessarily Granny's Doctrine
[1:22:54] because even our precious grannies could
[1:22:56] have had it wrong but we don't have to
[1:22:58] have it wrong in our day because God
[1:23:01] sent a word he sent a message amen and
[1:23:05] we're not looking today to the
[1:23:07] forerunning prophet we're looking today
[1:23:09] to the forerunning message
[1:23:11] come on because it's a now I know that
[1:23:13] there is an element of Truth when people
[1:23:16] say you can't separate the messenger
[1:23:18] from the message I understand the
[1:23:21] element of what they're saying
[1:23:23] but I also know that a messenger is a
[1:23:26] sinner saved by grace
[1:23:28] it wasn't a Heavenly angel that we're
[1:23:30] hearing from although it sort of really
[1:23:32] was but he had an Earthly mouthpiece
[1:23:36] amen and I heard somebody explain it so
[1:23:40] beautifully yesterday when he was
[1:23:42] talking about having a perfect balance I
[1:23:46] was listening at this little brother
[1:23:47] preach and he was talking about having a
[1:23:50] perfect balance and he said in order to
[1:23:52] have a perfect balance in in the word
[1:23:55] you'd have to be perfected
[1:23:57] and he said so not just the inner part
[1:24:00] of who you are but even there would have
[1:24:02] to be some perfection in your flesh so
[1:24:05] we can say that the only one I'm just
[1:24:07] quoting another little preacher now he
[1:24:10] said we could say that the only perfect
[1:24:13] balance in the word was what was
[1:24:15] represented by the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:24:18] because any time a man a sinner saved by
[1:24:22] grace begins to to speak then there's
[1:24:25] that element of opinion that can
[1:24:27] sometimes come in now thank God we're
[1:24:30] not counting on opinion now we have the
[1:24:32] saith the Lord do you believe that so we
[1:24:36] don't have to wonder about how to get
[1:24:38] out of here the way has been made very
[1:24:41] clear the Lord Jesus Christ has been
[1:24:43] unveiled before us in the word and we
[1:24:46] are thankful for the messenger and we
[1:24:49] are thankful for the message our focus
[1:24:52] in this hour is not to be the messenger
[1:24:55] our focus in this hour is to be the
[1:24:58] message because it was the message that
[1:25:01] was to forerun the the second coming of
[1:25:04] the Lord Jesus Christ there can't be a
[1:25:07] message without a messenger I don't know
[1:25:09] if you remember this or not but the
[1:25:11] spirit of the Lord spoke to us some
[1:25:13] years ago and I recently heard sister
[1:25:15] elfrida mention and he took us in a
[1:25:19] series of dates and he took us to
[1:25:22] December the 24th
[1:25:24] 1965. and I said in this experience I
[1:25:27] know exactly what that is that is the
[1:25:30] day of brother branham's death and I was
[1:25:33] corrected in that experience and I was
[1:25:36] told that it was indeed the end of one
[1:25:39] man Ministry
[1:25:42] you see there'll never be another one
[1:25:44] man come on the scene to have the
[1:25:46] ministry of Jesus Christ in the earth
[1:25:48] that was the end of a real era talk
[1:25:51] about a a real uh cycle it came to an
[1:25:55] end then the prophet tells us over and
[1:25:59] over again that all throughout history
[1:26:01] God uses one man in a generation
[1:26:05] I believe because of the word of the
[1:26:07] Lord that that ended in the in December
[1:26:10] of 1965 when the last one-man Ministry
[1:26:14] was removed from the earth and so now we
[1:26:17] have Ministry but it's not from one man
[1:26:20] it's a many membered body it's a bride
[1:26:23] Ministry is anybody following what I'm
[1:26:26] saying it's a corporate body coming
[1:26:29] together underneath that word and like
[1:26:33] John who was a type of the Bride in
[1:26:35] Revelation chapter 10 we will also be
[1:26:38] required to eat the book
[1:26:40] so keep eating this message I know there
[1:26:43] are many things out there to capture our
[1:26:45] attention but don't you neglect to hear
[1:26:48] the word of the hour don't neglect to
[1:26:51] hear the message of the hour it's life
[1:26:54] to us I'm waiting on you to help me now
[1:26:57] and building a foundation for something
[1:26:59] but I'm not going too far if you won't
[1:27:02] get with me now
[1:27:04] now we've got to have that there's
[1:27:06] transforming power as we sit under that
[1:27:09] message it changes our life it reorders
[1:27:13] our steps it is a guide to us thankfully
[1:27:17] we have the Holy Ghost as our God but
[1:27:20] that word also serves us as a God to
[1:27:24] keep us out of the ditches because it's
[1:27:27] a middle of the road that this bride is
[1:27:29] walking amen not extreme to the right
[1:27:32] not extreme to the left we're seeking
[1:27:34] the middle of the road which is taking
[1:27:37] the message of the hour right back to
[1:27:39] the Bible
[1:27:42] right back to the word
[1:27:44] if you hear something that doesn't go
[1:27:47] right back to the word don't be critical
[1:27:49] leave it
[1:27:51] God will help us to understand it later
[1:27:54] but when you can take this message and
[1:27:58] lay it right within the pages of God's
[1:28:01] word you have all the ammunition you
[1:28:03] need to defeat the enemy in this day
[1:28:05] hello
[1:28:07] you see that's why God sent it to us to
[1:28:09] open our eyes that we might really have
[1:28:12] relationship with Jesus Christ this
[1:28:15] message didn't come to give us a head
[1:28:17] knowledge of Jesus
[1:28:18] no siree this message came to so unveil
[1:28:21] him and make him so real before us that
[1:28:25] we can become one with him
[1:28:29] if you think I'm just talking off my hat
[1:28:32] I'll come back in a moment with a quote
[1:28:36] then those of you who haven't amen yet
[1:28:39] you can amen
[1:28:40] we won't leave here till we get
[1:28:42] everybody involved all right now I want
[1:28:45] to go to another reading it's a little
[1:28:46] bit of a long reading you'll have to
[1:28:48] forgive me for that it's Numbers Chapter
[1:28:51] 20.
[1:28:53] and it begins in verse two I want to
[1:28:56] make sure we get a lot of this we're we
[1:28:59] have as I started to say
[1:29:02] uh we were talking about the transition
[1:29:05] between the bitter belly syndrome of
[1:29:09] eating this word and it getting in there
[1:29:11] it's costing us something some of the
[1:29:14] family don't want to talk to us anymore
[1:29:16] some people call us a cult it gets a
[1:29:19] little bitter down in there it's painful
[1:29:21] sometimes
[1:29:22] folks on our job look at us funny and
[1:29:26] some people say you follow a dead man
[1:29:28] and they've got all kinds of things and
[1:29:30] it gets a little bitter sometime you
[1:29:32] have to stand against the uh maybe the
[1:29:35] trinitarian thing or the or the or the
[1:29:38] title baptism thing and it gets a little
[1:29:40] difficult sometimes but you just let it
[1:29:43] digest you you don't get don't you dare
[1:29:46] turn away from it you just let it
[1:29:48] you that's the work of the holy spirit
[1:29:50] it's going to be sometimes sweet in your
[1:29:54] mouth that's when you hear it
[1:29:57] that's when you first start eating it
[1:29:59] when it starts changing the way you have
[1:30:01] to live your life it gets bitter in the
[1:30:03] belly but that's only two phases there's
[1:30:06] another phase and that third phase is
[1:30:09] prophesy again
[1:30:11] and I believe as brother Branham told us
[1:30:13] that's not just John that's being called
[1:30:15] on to release that word it's a broad
[1:30:18] Ministry to release that word we're not
[1:30:21] all preachers but we're all called to
[1:30:23] live by this book and our lives preach
[1:30:28] Our Lives testify of the truth that
[1:30:31] we've been changed by if you believe
[1:30:33] that same man all right verse verse 2
[1:30:36] and there was no water for the
[1:30:38] congregation and they gathered
[1:30:40] themselves together against Moses and
[1:30:42] against Aaron and the people chode with
[1:30:45] Moses and and spake saying what God that
[1:30:49] he would have died when I that we had
[1:30:52] died when our Brethren died before the
[1:30:54] Lord
[1:30:55] and why have you bro haven't we heard
[1:30:58] this already this seems to be the same
[1:31:00] old song the children of Israel were
[1:31:03] quite fond of this song weren't they
[1:31:04] they're just singing it over and over
[1:31:06] again and why have you brought us up the
[1:31:09] congregation of the Lord into this
[1:31:12] Wilderness that we and our cattle should
[1:31:14] die there and wherefore have ye made us
[1:31:17] to come out of Egypt to bring us in unto
[1:31:20] this evil place it is no place of seed
[1:31:24] or a figs or a vines or of pomegranates
[1:31:27] neither is there any water to drink or
[1:31:30] they're building their case and Moses
[1:31:32] and Aaron went from the presence of the
[1:31:35] assembly under the door of the
[1:31:37] Tabernacle of the congregation that's
[1:31:39] good advice for any minister
[1:31:42] when you can't please the people just go
[1:31:45] into the presence of the Lord and let
[1:31:47] him help you amen so they went into the
[1:31:50] door of the Tabernacle of the
[1:31:52] congregation and they fell upon their
[1:31:55] faces and guess what the glory the kavod
[1:31:58] the heavy presence of God his glory
[1:32:02] appeared unto them and the Lord spake
[1:32:06] unto Moses saying take the rod and
[1:32:10] gather thou the assembly together thou
[1:32:13] and Aaron thy brother and speak ye unto
[1:32:17] the rock before their eyes and it shall
[1:32:21] give forth his water and thou shalt
[1:32:25] bring forth to them water out of the
[1:32:28] rock now you know he's already done this
[1:32:32] he's already brought water from the rock
[1:32:34] but the last time Moses was told to take
[1:32:37] that rod and strike The Rock and God
[1:32:41] allowed water to come have you ever seen
[1:32:43] water coming out of a solid rock this is
[1:32:45] miraculous this is Supernatural this is
[1:32:48] God typing what was going to come at
[1:32:50] Calvary this is pointing to Something
[1:32:53] Beautiful in the future when Redemption
[1:32:56] is paid for
[1:32:57] and so this is not something new God has
[1:33:01] already before allowed water to come out
[1:33:04] of the rock but but this time Moses is
[1:33:07] told you take that rod and gather the
[1:33:10] people together but when it comes time
[1:33:12] to to get water you're not going to
[1:33:15] strike The Rock
[1:33:17] you're going to transition
[1:33:24] we hear about the Branham telling us so
[1:33:26] often if God has is ever going to do
[1:33:29] something he said you look back and see
[1:33:31] how God has done it in the past
[1:33:34] because how God has done it in the past
[1:33:36] he will always do it that way I fully
[1:33:40] understand what he's teaching don't you
[1:33:42] but I also understand that there are
[1:33:45] times of transition
[1:33:47] when God is building up to something
[1:33:49] else there is a crescendo that is taking
[1:33:52] place there is a consummation that is
[1:33:55] taking place and everything is gathering
[1:33:58] together in one moment we could even say
[1:34:00] that we're in a place like that as the
[1:34:02] little bride of Jesus Christ right now
[1:34:04] we're living in a world that's about to
[1:34:07] implode
[1:34:10] it's hard to get people to amen when
[1:34:12] you're talking about destruction but
[1:34:14] we're living in a world that's about to
[1:34:16] implode so the bride is at a very
[1:34:19] pivotal and important position in this
[1:34:22] hour
[1:34:23] and we're going to have to be very
[1:34:25] careful how we walk out the Future Days
[1:34:27] of our life
[1:34:28] we're going to understand that what we
[1:34:30] have gotten by with in the past we may
[1:34:33] not get by with in this hour
[1:34:35] the compromise that we have picked up
[1:34:37] along the way that God has allowed us
[1:34:39] just to go on we may not be able to
[1:34:42] compromise the same way in this hour
[1:34:45] we may have to come back to what the
[1:34:47] prophet said he said you've gone as far
[1:34:50] with God as you're ever going to go
[1:34:52] until you're willing to pay a greater
[1:34:54] price when we see so many Among Us
[1:34:57] picking up the world and seemingly
[1:35:00] sliding back into worldly things we
[1:35:03] can't look at them because we're not
[1:35:06] called to look at the church we're
[1:35:08] called to look at the Christ
[1:35:11] we can't look at them but what we can do
[1:35:14] is learn from their mistake we're not
[1:35:16] here to criticize them but we're here to
[1:35:19] learn and we might have to say Lord I
[1:35:22] want every bit of compromise out of my
[1:35:24] life
[1:35:25] I want everything out of my life that
[1:35:28] that is hindering me from the fullness
[1:35:30] of what your promise is to my life
[1:35:33] I think we may be in one of those
[1:35:35] transitioning moments do you follow me I
[1:35:38] think we may be in one of those from
[1:35:40] bitter belly to prophesy again
[1:35:43] we may be in another transition we may
[1:35:47] be coming out of of striking the Rock
[1:35:50] and we may be coming up to to an hour
[1:35:53] where we're called to speak to the rock
[1:35:55] you see the rock never has to be smitten
[1:35:58] again
[1:35:59] once was enough help me preach once was
[1:36:03] enough
[1:36:03] it never has to be smitten or stricken
[1:36:07] again it's already happened but there's
[1:36:10] something that follows that and that's
[1:36:12] what that's what God is revealing to
[1:36:14] Moses right here he said uh speak unto
[1:36:17] the rock before their eyes and it shall
[1:36:21] give forth his water
[1:36:25] and thou shalt bring forth to them
[1:36:28] water out of the rock is that what it
[1:36:31] said so Thou shalt give the congregation
[1:36:34] and their beasts drink
[1:36:38] and Moses took the rod from before the
[1:36:42] Lord as he commanded him and Moses and
[1:36:47] Aaron gathered the congregation together
[1:36:49] before the Rock and this is the rocket
[1:36:53] Horeb and he said unto them here now ye
[1:36:58] Rebels
[1:37:04] wow
[1:37:06] that's a little rough
[1:37:13] I've never been tempted
[1:37:18] too many times
[1:37:23] don't you have a heart for pastors
[1:37:26] [Music]
[1:37:28] that was so sad
[1:37:30] yeah Lord help them bless him Jesus
[1:37:34] folks this is a serious thing now
[1:37:38] we don't just need to pray for our own
[1:37:40] and you definitely need to pray for your
[1:37:42] own you need to pray for your pastor you
[1:37:44] need to pray for your associate pastor
[1:37:46] but we need to pray for pastors around
[1:37:47] this truth all over the world
[1:37:50] because they're in the middle of a bunch
[1:37:52] of stuff there's a lot going on and
[1:37:55] we're going to try not to come to the
[1:37:57] pulpit and say here now ye Rebels
[1:38:01] we're going to try to say brothers and
[1:38:03] sisters but Moses said here now ye
[1:38:06] Rebels must we fetch you water out of
[1:38:10] this rock
[1:38:12] and Moses lifted up his hand and with
[1:38:16] his Rod he not only smote The Rock once
[1:38:22] but he smote The Rock twice
[1:38:26] the prophet tells us that he threw the
[1:38:29] whole story of redemption out of cater
[1:38:33] it was a dangerous thing that Moses did
[1:38:36] he was gambling with his own eternity
[1:38:41] did you know it was that serious now God
[1:38:44] had mercy on him
[1:38:45] but he was gambling with his own
[1:38:48] position when he took this into his own
[1:38:51] hand and not only did he not speak to
[1:38:54] the Rock but he smoked the rock two
[1:38:56] times and guess what God did he honored
[1:39:00] his word
[1:39:01] he honored his prophet
[1:39:04] [Music]
[1:39:05] he honored the faith of the people even
[1:39:08] though they were being a bit rebellious
[1:39:10] and water began to come out abundantly
[1:39:13] and the congregation drank and the
[1:39:16] camels and the cattle and everything all
[1:39:18] the beasts were able to find water and
[1:39:22] the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron
[1:39:24] because ye believed me not
[1:39:28] this is serious words to sanctify me in
[1:39:33] the eyes of the children of Israel
[1:39:36] therefore ye shall not bring this
[1:39:40] congregation into the land which I have
[1:39:43] given them this was sad news
[1:39:47] here two lives dedicated to bringing the
[1:39:51] children of God into the land of promise
[1:39:55] but because the instructions of the Lord
[1:39:58] were not followed
[1:40:04] to the letter
[1:40:06] when God is speaking here he's not
[1:40:09] speaking in general terms he's speaking
[1:40:11] meticulously he's speaking specifically
[1:40:14] how I want it done now I'm going to send
[1:40:18] the water
[1:40:19] but I want you this time to speak to the
[1:40:22] Rock
[1:40:23] and Moses is standing there thinking
[1:40:26] about had all I can take
[1:40:28] and he raises up that Rod he's supposed
[1:40:31] to have the rod God told him to use the
[1:40:34] rod but not to strike to speak this time
[1:40:38] and he dared not only strike but he
[1:40:41] struck two different times two separate
[1:40:44] individual times and it got him in some
[1:40:47] pretty big trouble
[1:40:49] he said you didn't sanctify me in the
[1:40:52] eyes of the children of Israel therefore
[1:40:53] ye shall not bring this congregation
[1:40:55] into the land which I have given them
[1:40:58] and this is the water of meribah because
[1:41:01] the children of Israel strove with the
[1:41:05] Lord
[1:41:06] and he was Sanctified in them
[1:41:12] I want you to go to experiences
[1:41:15] this is about as far back as you can go
[1:41:17] 1947.
[1:41:20] brother Branham said the church has
[1:41:23] failed I wonder what he would say about
[1:41:25] the church at large today
[1:41:28] 2023 2023 in 1947 he's saying the church
[1:41:34] has failed see instead of bringing the
[1:41:37] people together as one body it separated
[1:41:41] them out
[1:41:43] you see God wasn't pleased with this
[1:41:46] denominational idea
[1:41:48] God was looking to have one body not a
[1:41:51] divided body his body is not divided
[1:41:55] God is one amen
[1:41:57] he can't be chopped into pieces and God
[1:42:00] was looking for a people that couldn't
[1:42:03] be chuffed into pieces
[1:42:05] he said look how he Compares it here
[1:42:08] he's talking about if you go back he's
[1:42:10] talking about the different churches the
[1:42:13] different denominations the different
[1:42:14] ideas and and look what he Compares it
[1:42:17] to he said just like Moses
[1:42:19] instead of speaking to the Rock he smote
[1:42:23] The Rock and it failed
[1:42:27] now we know water came
[1:42:31] so it wasn't the method that failed
[1:42:34] because the Bible tells us that water
[1:42:36] came but there was a problem and the
[1:42:39] problem fell on Moses
[1:42:41] he said so the church will never take
[1:42:45] the people over Jordan
[1:42:50] and may I add neither did Moses
[1:42:55] all right
[1:42:56] this was the price that Moses had to pay
[1:43:00] so brother Branham says the church will
[1:43:02] never take the people over that's right
[1:43:05] but now God has changed his order
[1:43:14] that's kind of important to note
[1:43:17] and he's sending back you who mark my
[1:43:21] word there's Great Men on the road to
[1:43:24] this world
[1:43:26] that's right there's great powers on the
[1:43:29] road to this world he's talking about
[1:43:32] they're coming up now
[1:43:34] there's great powers on the road to this
[1:43:36] world and I want you all to read the
[1:43:39] next sentence
[1:43:40] I want you to work a little bit read the
[1:43:42] next sentence in yellow and and
[1:43:51] because it's speaking about an hour
[1:43:53] where the one-man Ministry has ended
[1:43:57] and it's it's not
[1:43:59] many people gathering around one man
[1:44:02] anymore
[1:44:03] do you understand
[1:44:05] it's now about a bride of sons
[1:44:09] it's about a company of Overcomers it's
[1:44:13] it's about a people that have been tried
[1:44:15] and tested but have come forth like gold
[1:44:18] in the last hour and it'll be a people
[1:44:20] that'll call out a people not just a
[1:44:23] prophet calling out a people but a
[1:44:25] people that'll call out a people and he
[1:44:28] said Remember come out of her my people
[1:44:31] this is this is something we're very
[1:44:33] familiar with come out of her my people
[1:44:37] he said is that right Babylon confusion
[1:44:42] and not the people now not out of your
[1:44:45] churches
[1:44:46] but come out of that confusion among you
[1:44:50] you see
[1:44:52] now listen to what he said he said come
[1:44:54] out let's serve God this would be good
[1:44:57] for us this was 1947 but it'd still be
[1:44:59] all right for today I believe it would
[1:45:01] be seems to be a word based uh statement
[1:45:04] here he said come out let's serve god
[1:45:07] with one heart
[1:45:10] no division among us we're serving God
[1:45:13] with one heart with one mind and one
[1:45:17] Accord he said is that right and then
[1:45:20] look what God will do God
[1:45:25] God will take this his church God will
[1:45:31] take his church over Jordan
[1:45:33] [Music]
[1:45:34] you see Moses didn't get to do it
[1:45:37] my I'm not getting the help I need this
[1:45:39] morning I'm sorry I don't want to sound
[1:45:41] like a pouty preacher especially when
[1:45:43] I'm preaching on this
[1:45:46] but I I'm feeling like I'm feeling a
[1:45:49] little something stirring and I need a
[1:45:51] little extra help and I'm asking for it
[1:45:54] oh you Silent Ones
[1:45:57] come out let's serve god with one heart
[1:46:00] one mind and one Accord is that right he
[1:46:03] said and then God God God
[1:46:07] you can't look to Moses to do it now
[1:46:09] because Moses wasn't allowed to go in
[1:46:13] he said God don't worry God will take
[1:46:16] his church over Jordan
[1:46:20] we hear so many people talking about the
[1:46:24] news
[1:46:25] in 1965 I've just sat on the podcast
[1:46:29] where sister Alfreda was giving her
[1:46:32] testimony
[1:46:33] and and so it's kind of still stirring
[1:46:36] in my in my mind
[1:46:39] and and here she was relatively new
[1:46:43] to the message at that time the time
[1:46:46] that brother Branham was about to leave
[1:46:48] the scene she's just heard one one
[1:46:50] series of meetings and then she begins
[1:46:53] to to hear tapes and she knows that once
[1:46:56] she has been to Phoenix and has heard
[1:46:58] brother Branham in that series of
[1:47:00] meetings she'll no longer be able to go
[1:47:02] back to the little to the little rescue
[1:47:04] mission where she had been attending
[1:47:06] church she'd come out of the German
[1:47:08] Baptist Church and into the Pentecostal
[1:47:11] church but the little Pentecostal Church
[1:47:13] happened to have a woman pastor
[1:47:15] so now she's gone down she's heard this
[1:47:18] uh uh prophet and she's seen these
[1:47:21] things you'll hear it in the podcast she
[1:47:23] was there when Bishop Stanley helped
[1:47:26] brother Branham because brother Branham
[1:47:28] had just been given a new Bible
[1:47:30] and the pages of his Bible were sticking
[1:47:33] together
[1:47:35] and he got in a little bit of a panic
[1:47:38] anybody would he's standing in front of
[1:47:40] all those people the the International
[1:47:42] Convention the Full Gospel businessman's
[1:47:44] Fellowship
[1:47:46] and he got a little nervous and and
[1:47:48] Bishop Stanley dressed like a priest
[1:47:51] he comes uh forward and and touches
[1:47:55] brother branham's arm and speaks to him
[1:47:56] step Be steady
[1:47:59] and I'm paraphrasing now God's doing
[1:48:02] something
[1:48:04] you you're nervous and and but God is
[1:48:07] doing something something is happening
[1:48:10] in this moment
[1:48:11] and she saw that she was in that service
[1:48:14] is that right she was in that service
[1:48:18] and then they left the next morning or
[1:48:21] some sometime quite right after that and
[1:48:24] she was not in the service
[1:48:27] where brother Branham was given about a
[1:48:29] half an hour it wasn't his speaking he
[1:48:31] wasn't to speak in that service he was
[1:48:34] supposed to have even moved on
[1:48:36] but he stayed and they gave him about 30
[1:48:39] minutes to speak a little bit about what
[1:48:41] had transpired and it looked like God
[1:48:43] and then we have the sermon that he
[1:48:45] preached some months later where he
[1:48:47] called it this day
[1:48:51] this scripture is fulfilled in your ears
[1:48:54] okay what month was the what month was
[1:48:57] the meetings there that you attended
[1:49:00] in January of 65.
[1:49:03] and so in December of the same Year
[1:49:06] brother Branham is gone
[1:49:08] so here she is just feasting on the
[1:49:11] tapes because now they're passing the
[1:49:13] tapes around Edmonton
[1:49:16] and they're they're hearing them and and
[1:49:18] the people are realizing we can't go
[1:49:20] back
[1:49:22] to our Pentecostal mission
[1:49:24] and we can't go back to just a German
[1:49:27] Baptist we've got to go on with the word
[1:49:30] don't you appreciate somebody
[1:49:33] don't you appreciate somebody who hears
[1:49:35] the eagle cry
[1:49:37] and says I can't go back to where I was
[1:49:40] because there's more for me
[1:49:43] the call of the spirit that says there's
[1:49:46] something more for us and it's not
[1:49:48] convenient
[1:49:50] it's not like it is today
[1:49:53] that that all I have to do is go here
[1:49:55] and I hear any message I want to hear
[1:49:57] right here
[1:50:00] we're talking about a day of the reel to
[1:50:02] real
[1:50:04] I'm assuming yes
[1:50:07] reel to real well first of all the
[1:50:09] players this big
[1:50:12] you don't put a reel-to-reel recorder in
[1:50:14] your pocket
[1:50:16] you put in the trunk of your car
[1:50:18] so that's got to be hauled and and and
[1:50:21] brother random was no short preacher you
[1:50:23] know he was long-winded like like others
[1:50:25] I know and he had a lot more to say I
[1:50:28] get it and so one real wouldn't do it
[1:50:32] so you're talking about sometimes for
[1:50:34] reals
[1:50:37] of a Sunday service
[1:50:39] and they had to to find whose house
[1:50:42] we're going to meet at
[1:50:44] and they had to drag that old tape
[1:50:46] player
[1:50:48] and drag those tapes around and they
[1:50:50] were hard to get
[1:50:52] it wasn't like you can just go on the
[1:50:55] internet and pull them down
[1:50:57] you had one copy and they passed that
[1:51:00] copy and now one year has transpired in
[1:51:04] her testimony and he's gone
[1:51:08] now to some of you who don't understand
[1:51:10] the ministry that means nothing to you
[1:51:13] but you who understand the ministry that
[1:51:15] he had you understand how heartbreaking
[1:51:17] that would be because he was speaking
[1:51:19] about things that were to come
[1:51:22] don't tell me he wasn't
[1:51:26] he was speaking about things that were
[1:51:28] to come and now he's gone
[1:51:31] and the people couldn't figure out how
[1:51:33] do how do we it must have been like the
[1:51:35] disciples and I hope I don't offend you
[1:51:37] with my analogy here but it must have
[1:51:39] been like the disciples here's a messiah
[1:51:41] whose teaching and preaching about the
[1:51:44] kingdom coming
[1:51:45] and then they see him crucified
[1:51:49] and laid in a tomb and their hearts are
[1:51:52] broken here's a prophet messenger who
[1:51:55] comes to tie together the Loose Ends of
[1:51:57] all the other messages
[1:51:59] and now he's gone and before he leaves
[1:52:03] he prophesies
[1:52:05] and he teaches and he preaches of things
[1:52:08] to come and he tells it as though he's
[1:52:11] going to physically participate in these
[1:52:13] things to come
[1:52:15] and so the people are trying to figure
[1:52:17] out and and those of you who've been
[1:52:19] around this long enough you know all the
[1:52:21] crazy uh crazy ideas that came out of
[1:52:23] this
[1:52:24] you know
[1:52:26] and the airplane that's rusted just a a
[1:52:28] pile of rusted bolts out there in in the
[1:52:32] in the wilderness waiting on waiting on
[1:52:34] the day that it needs to be restored to
[1:52:36] carry brother Branham from place to
[1:52:37] place and the money for the tent and
[1:52:39] these are not just pieces of Gossip
[1:52:41] these are things that through the years
[1:52:43] we've come to know not come to speculate
[1:52:46] but come to know
[1:52:47] amen I was even invited I didn't have a
[1:52:50] time to make the to make the trip but I
[1:52:52] was even invited don't you want to come
[1:52:54] and see the airplane because there's no
[1:52:57] way in the world that these things are
[1:52:59] going to be able to come to pass in the
[1:53:00] absence of the Prophet the disciples
[1:53:02] must have felt the same way there's no
[1:53:05] way that God's going to be able to birth
[1:53:06] a church
[1:53:07] [Music]
[1:53:09] that establishes a kingdom with the
[1:53:11] Messiah not on the scene but I want to
[1:53:14] tell you God had a plan
[1:53:18] he was about to transfer that anointing
[1:53:21] from one man to 120.
[1:53:26] and 120 to 3 000 not the call of the
[1:53:30] Prophet not the office of the Prophet
[1:53:32] not the minute we're not talking about
[1:53:34] the ministry we're talking about the
[1:53:36] fruit of the ministry we're talking
[1:53:37] about Holy Ghost
[1:53:39] [Applause]
[1:53:41] so so it went from one Jesus
[1:53:44] you see you've got to know what the Holy
[1:53:46] Ghost baptism is it's not a piece of him
[1:53:50] it's him
[1:53:52] it's him it's deity
[1:53:54] when you receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:53:57] Ghost the very life of God is walking
[1:54:00] around in your shoe leather
[1:54:03] isn't that right and so it went from one
[1:54:06] Jesus
[1:54:07] to a multiplication
[1:54:10] just like we were taught one seed goes
[1:54:13] into the ground
[1:54:14] and a harvest comes up am I out of the
[1:54:16] word here am I telling you the truth one
[1:54:18] seed goes in didn't the bible say that
[1:54:21] Jesus was the firstborn
[1:54:23] among many brethren if that's the case
[1:54:26] then we could come to the hour we live
[1:54:28] again and we could say that the way God
[1:54:30] used brother Branham
[1:54:31] was one man to the age but the truth
[1:54:35] that he brought
[1:54:38] the way he introduced the people to
[1:54:40] Jesus Christ we can say that was like
[1:54:42] one seed
[1:54:44] and many sons to follow
[1:54:47] but it was hard to see that it was hard
[1:54:49] for sister Alfred it was hard for
[1:54:50] brothers it was hard for so many people
[1:54:52] how can these things come to pass in the
[1:54:54] physical absence of the Prophet but
[1:54:57] didn't God do it that way before
[1:55:00] so really we shouldn't maybe they
[1:55:02] shouldn't have been sold but that's what
[1:55:04] happens sometime when everything hangs
[1:55:06] on one man
[1:55:08] this is not criticism
[1:55:10] we're talking about a Ministry that had
[1:55:12] not been seen in the earth since the
[1:55:14] days of John the Baptist in the Lord
[1:55:15] Jesus Christ
[1:55:17] we're not talking about just a little
[1:55:19] Pentecostal story we're talking about
[1:55:21] opening up of the seals
[1:55:23] we're talking about the mysteries of God
[1:55:25] coming to a finish hello that's just the
[1:55:28] book I'm just talking from the book
[1:55:31] and now the the messenger's gone so
[1:55:33] who's going to explain the rest you know
[1:55:34] it didn't really need further
[1:55:36] explanation it really just needed
[1:55:38] demonstration
[1:55:40] it really just needed manifestation
[1:55:42] didn't it it just really needed to come
[1:55:44] to pass because there's one thing you
[1:55:47] need to know if there's anything that
[1:55:49] you need to know and you don't know you
[1:55:51] will know
[1:55:52] because you're his
[1:55:54] if there's anything that has to be made
[1:55:57] real to you and it hasn't been made real
[1:55:58] to you yet hold on
[1:56:01] because if you're part of that elected
[1:56:03] bride there'll be no Rapture without you
[1:56:06] [Applause]
[1:56:10] because you become one with that word
[1:56:12] and the same holy ghost that helps you
[1:56:15] helps your neighbor there will help you
[1:56:17] if you keep your eyes on the Sun
[1:56:19] remember we preached last Sunday don't
[1:56:21] look at the church don't look at any
[1:56:22] church
[1:56:23] don't look at other message searches
[1:56:25] don't look at your church
[1:56:28] because there's flesh in all of them
[1:56:33] there's mistakes in all of them
[1:56:36] yes
[1:56:40] you get your eyes on people
[1:56:44] you won't feel you won't see that
[1:56:46] manifestation of the truth in you but
[1:56:48] you get your eyes on the son
[1:56:50] don't matter what the storm is doing do
[1:56:52] you hear the song doesn't matter what
[1:56:54] the storm is doing around you you get
[1:56:55] your eyes on Jesus just get your eyes on
[1:56:58] Jesus someone said I can't figure all
[1:57:00] this out I don't know how to put all
[1:57:02] these things you're talking about terms
[1:57:03] that I don't know anything about well
[1:57:05] just stick around don't be scared off
[1:57:08] stick around because we have a
[1:57:11] determination to keep our eyes on Jesus
[1:57:13] and if we do he'll lead us all the way
[1:57:18] you see there's got to be a people who
[1:57:20] recognize when the pillar of fire moves
[1:57:25] that they don't just keep driving their
[1:57:28] steak down
[1:57:29] but they keep following that Pillar of
[1:57:32] Fire
[1:57:33] because he'll not lead you off the word
[1:57:36] he leads you always back to the word
[1:57:39] some of you people need an app
[1:57:43] some of you are getting one now
[1:57:49] where did I stop
[1:57:51] where am I
[1:57:52] did we finish that uh did we finish that
[1:57:56] not quite
[1:57:59] come out let's serve god with one heart
[1:58:01] one mind one Accord is that right
[1:58:03] and then and then God
[1:58:08] even in the absence of the prophet
[1:58:11] even in the physical absence of Moses
[1:58:15] God will take his church over Jordan
[1:58:18] although we know that there was a
[1:58:20] portion of brother branham's Ministry
[1:58:22] that was also under a Joshua commission
[1:58:24] he said so
[1:58:26] he identified for us who the real Joshua
[1:58:28] is
[1:58:32] it's the Holy Ghost
[1:58:34] we've got to have the Holy Ghost we've
[1:58:37] got to have the Holy Ghost I didn't say
[1:58:39] we've got to speak in tongues I said
[1:58:41] we've got to have the Holy Ghost
[1:58:45] because he changes everything
[1:58:48] amen he tuned you up so that you can
[1:58:51] hear the voice of God and keep moving
[1:58:53] forward he said God will take his church
[1:58:56] over Jordan that's over death now you
[1:58:58] believe that with all your heart and and
[1:59:00] that that's a that's something that we
[1:59:02] have to settle within ourselves whether
[1:59:05] we can believe that
[1:59:07] with all of our heart
[1:59:09] is at the end of that one charity
[1:59:12] all right now let's go on Israel in the
[1:59:15] church
[1:59:20] paragraph 56 on up they come
[1:59:24] into the smitten Rock
[1:59:27] notice when they come to the Rock they
[1:59:30] had need
[1:59:31] now Moses smote the rock with the rod
[1:59:36] he said that's where we left last night
[1:59:38] smote the rock with the rod and the rod
[1:59:43] was God's judgment Rod it represented
[1:59:46] the judgments of God and he smote The
[1:59:49] Rock and guess what happened there was a
[1:59:53] cleft there was a breach there was a
[1:59:57] break in the left side of the Rock
[2:00:01] he said when the children of Israel got
[2:00:04] hungry
[2:00:05] this is interesting
[2:00:07] they went there
[2:00:12] a beehive got in there
[2:00:15] made a hive and they got honey
[2:00:19] out of the Rock
[2:00:23] right where The Rock was smitten
[2:00:26] everything they had need of
[2:00:30] read it
[2:00:31] I love to hear you was in The Rock
[2:00:34] The Rock followed the church
[2:00:39] and The Rock was
[2:00:42] when they were thirsty
[2:00:46] when they were hungry
[2:00:49] wherever they went the rock followed
[2:00:53] them who's ever heard of such a thing as
[2:00:56] that
[2:01:02] but I believe it
[2:01:05] Gene Edwards did an amazing job some of
[2:01:08] you have read the Divine Romance
[2:01:10] by Gene Edwards Gene Edwards did an
[2:01:12] amazing job in the Escape
[2:01:14] in the in the series of books that he
[2:01:16] wrote where he dramatized different
[2:01:19] Bible events one was the creation one
[2:01:21] was the Escape out of Egypt and one was
[2:01:23] the birth of Jesus I think and if you
[2:01:26] ever have a chance to get to to read any
[2:01:29] of that from I think it was called The
[2:01:31] Escape he made that so real until it it
[2:01:34] it it it it shook me I mean it really
[2:01:36] really shook me because he believed from
[2:01:39] from his uh understanding and here
[2:01:41] evidently brother Madam is telling us
[2:01:43] pretty much the same thing and the word
[2:01:45] said so in First Corinthians chapter 10
[2:01:47] but he made it seem real he said here
[2:01:49] they they went on and they got thirsty
[2:01:52] again and somebody said what are we
[2:01:54] going to do this is Gene Edwards now
[2:01:56] somebody said what are they going to do
[2:01:57] and he turned around and guess what
[2:02:01] the rock of Horeb was there
[2:02:04] oh somebody said I can't believe
[2:02:06] anything like that you can't
[2:02:09] you can't believe that God is a
[2:02:11] supernatural God and he knows how to
[2:02:14] pick up a rock
[2:02:16] this wasn't an ordinary rock it was a
[2:02:18] rock that represented something
[2:02:21] when they were thirsty they drank from
[2:02:23] The Rock when they were hungry they ate
[2:02:25] from The Rock wherever they went the
[2:02:27] rock followed them and guess what and
[2:02:29] The Rock still following the church oh
[2:02:34] Hallelujah
[2:02:36] Christ is the rock that was in the
[2:02:39] wilderness notice now then
[2:02:41] what'd he say
[2:02:43] that same Rock
[2:02:45] in the same message paragraph 173 stay
[2:02:48] with me if you can but when he glorified
[2:02:51] himself down there instead of God
[2:02:58] his brother branham's interpretation of
[2:03:00] of how Moses behaved
[2:03:05] he drew the attention to himself
[2:03:09] he he lifted himself up in the sight of
[2:03:14] the people instead of glorifying God
[2:03:17] when he glorified himself down there
[2:03:20] instead of God before that rock when God
[2:03:22] told him said go speak to the Rock don't
[2:03:25] Smite it
[2:03:28] speak to it The Rock was only smitten
[2:03:32] it was only to be smitten one time
[2:03:36] and Moses got his temper all up and ran
[2:03:40] down run down there and smote The Rock
[2:03:43] it didn't bring water he said so he
[2:03:45] smote it again it brought water said you
[2:03:50] rebels
[2:03:51] must we fetch you water out of this rock
[2:03:57] he said like that and brought forth the
[2:03:59] waters because God had to listen to that
[2:04:02] Prophet because he had endowed him with
[2:04:06] that power
[2:04:09] isn't that something
[2:04:13] maybe it would have been tempting to
[2:04:15] make an example out of Moses
[2:04:18] but he had already put the power in
[2:04:21] Moses
[2:04:22] he had already given Moses the voice of
[2:04:25] authority and he was not going to
[2:04:27] humiliate him in front of the people
[2:04:29] even though Moses was glorifying himself
[2:04:32] and not the God who sent him
[2:04:35] and and then he goes on to say and that
[2:04:37] broke the whole program
[2:04:42] because how many times was Christ to be
[2:04:44] smitten once
[2:04:47] when he finished that that that death
[2:04:51] and and took his blood and placed it on
[2:04:54] The Mercy Seat he was never to have to
[2:04:58] die again he was never to be crucified
[2:05:01] again he was never to have to bleed
[2:05:04] again
[2:05:07] he'd already done that
[2:05:10] Christ was submitting once
[2:05:12] we speak we speak we speak to the Rock
[2:05:17] now we speak to the right now
[2:05:20] remember last Sunday it was ask and you
[2:05:23] shall receive seek and you shall find
[2:05:26] knock and it shall be opened unto you
[2:05:28] remember last Sunday it was it was ask
[2:05:32] abundantly
[2:05:37] seek passionately
[2:05:42] and be annoying
[2:05:45] with your knock that's what he said
[2:05:48] be an annoyance
[2:05:50] with your knock
[2:05:52] it's about
[2:05:54] verbalizing vocalizing your need
[2:05:58] and and it almost sounds like that it's
[2:06:02] a petition it's it's a I don't want to
[2:06:04] say a beg because this little bride
[2:06:07] doesn't have to beg but she's laying it
[2:06:09] out very over and over again she's
[2:06:12] laying out her need like the little
[2:06:13] woman knocking again telling it again
[2:06:15] telling it again telling it again there
[2:06:17] comes a time when God said you've cried
[2:06:19] enough
[2:06:21] you've begged enough
[2:06:23] you've whined enough
[2:06:25] you've asked enough
[2:06:27] and now it's time to do something else
[2:06:31] just speak to it
[2:06:33] just speak to it it's already been
[2:06:35] smitten just speak to it and look what
[2:06:37] it does read the rest
[2:06:39] and it what
[2:06:43] in the message the angel and his
[2:06:45] Commission
[2:06:47] the Angel and the commission
[2:06:51] he said now let's just get right down to
[2:06:53] our hearts now
[2:06:55] and I want to tell you something
[2:06:58] and we want to talk just for a few
[2:07:00] minutes
[2:07:01] just Heart to Heart
[2:07:04] he said now notice excuse me sorry but
[2:07:08] now I realize and you realize too and
[2:07:12] ministers
[2:07:14] that a man can take a Divine I don't
[2:07:17] want you to miss this church
[2:07:19] a man can take a Divine gift
[2:07:27] and send his soul to hell
[2:07:31] with it
[2:07:34] he said you know that it's a question a
[2:07:36] gift from God
[2:07:37] now I don't mean just something that you
[2:07:40] imagine
[2:07:41] he said I mean if God has really given
[2:07:44] something and give it to your charge
[2:07:48] you've got I hope you're hearing me
[2:07:51] you've got to use that with the wisdom
[2:07:57] of God
[2:07:59] because you might have a Divine gift
[2:08:02] but if you operate that gift
[2:08:05] separated from the wisdom of God
[2:08:09] you can jeopardize your own eternity did
[2:08:14] I say that right
[2:08:16] now this is a message that we need to
[2:08:18] focus because sometimes we we preach
[2:08:22] about gifts
[2:08:24] we believe in gifts
[2:08:27] we see where we feel like brother random
[2:08:29] said and we feel the same I can see
[2:08:31] where they were placed in the church
[2:08:34] I'm still looking for worthy where they
[2:08:37] come out
[2:08:39] I know we have Brethren around this
[2:08:42] message who believes that that which is
[2:08:44] perfect has come
[2:08:46] and so we don't need these little pieces
[2:08:49] of gifts any longer I don't believe that
[2:08:52] because in one place brother Branham
[2:08:54] calls that which is perfect he calls it
[2:08:56] the perfect interpretation or the
[2:08:58] fullness of the word and several times
[2:09:00] he said that's perfect love
[2:09:05] and although we may have the perfect
[2:09:07] interpretation of the word we're we're
[2:09:10] still pushing toward
[2:09:13] believing for
[2:09:17] we know we've been loved with perfect
[2:09:19] love
[2:09:20] and now we're trying to learn to love
[2:09:22] one another
[2:09:29] I was in a meeting one time when they
[2:09:31] were they were preaching this and and uh
[2:09:34] and they and they brought in this
[2:09:36] perfect love thing and that it was part
[2:09:38] of that which is perfect and if it
[2:09:40] wasn't here
[2:09:42] but they preached it as though they had
[2:09:43] received this perfect love and that it
[2:09:45] was just you know emanating and flowing
[2:09:47] out of their life
[2:09:48] and I went to them after the meeting and
[2:09:51] and appreciated so many wonderful things
[2:09:53] that I heard but then I asked I'm just
[2:09:55] wondering how is your perfect love how
[2:09:57] are are you in that place can you
[2:10:00] testify to me that that perfect love is
[2:10:02] present in your life and and it's just
[2:10:04] demonstrating itself and flowing out of
[2:10:07] you and I didn't mean to be
[2:10:09] confrontational I didn't mean to be
[2:10:11] controversial but what I got next was a
[2:10:14] tongue lashing like I'd never had
[2:10:18] and when I got through I wanted to be
[2:10:20] humble I wanted to be sweet and I wanted
[2:10:23] to take my weapon with kindness but and
[2:10:26] then I did
[2:10:28] but when I walked away
[2:10:31] I thought if that's perfect love
[2:10:37] you just castigated you you you you you
[2:10:40] you you totally
[2:10:42] if I was just following because of a
[2:10:45] popularity or something I would have I'd
[2:10:48] have run run the other direction but
[2:10:50] it's just like it's just like brother
[2:10:52] Wallace used to sing you didn't put me
[2:10:54] in
[2:10:56] and you can't put me out I'm gonna tell
[2:10:59] you that this bride is going to have to
[2:11:01] operate in perfect love we're going to
[2:11:04] have to have it and a good way to have
[2:11:07] it is to start practicing loving one
[2:11:09] another
[2:11:11] in spite of our flaws
[2:11:14] amen
[2:11:16] you ask the Lord sometime Lord let me
[2:11:19] love people like you love them
[2:11:22] let me not focus on their failure let me
[2:11:24] focus on their faith let me believe that
[2:11:27] you're not finished with them yet
[2:11:32] so I believe in gifts and sometimes
[2:11:34] we're preaching to try to uh get people
[2:11:37] and encourage people to to yield
[2:11:40] themselves
[2:11:42] to the gift that God has placed in their
[2:11:44] life we're just bringing a balance here
[2:11:47] by saying that any Divine gift
[2:11:51] when it's not used with wisdom
[2:11:58] Moses had a Divine gift but he wasn't
[2:12:01] operating that day with the wisdom
[2:12:04] and it changed his destiny
[2:12:09] he was a chosen man to take the children
[2:12:11] of Israel over but instead he found
[2:12:14] himself up on the top of Mount Nebo and
[2:12:18] he was told I'm going to show you
[2:12:21] you're gonna see it with your eyes but
[2:12:24] you're not going to be able to taste
[2:12:26] thereof because you used what I gave you
[2:12:30] and you glorified yourself
[2:12:32] in the opportunity that you had to
[2:12:35] glorify me
[2:12:36] so I'd say if we're going to use the
[2:12:39] gifts of God that have been placed in
[2:12:41] our lives we should only use them for
[2:12:44] the benefit of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[2:12:47] that they should operate in wisdom and
[2:12:49] they should never be used to beat people
[2:12:50] or to expose people
[2:12:54] to embarrass people I didn't mean to
[2:12:57] make you nervous
[2:13:02] now he goes on
[2:13:07] make this Valley full of ditches I want
[2:13:09] to go there if you let me no no excuse
[2:13:11] me the works that I do bear that that I
[2:13:13] do bear witness of me and just a couple
[2:13:16] more and we'll move on
[2:13:18] he said now notice
[2:13:21] now Moses smote the rock the second time
[2:13:25] representing that Christ should come to
[2:13:28] the Earth and die again
[2:13:30] now he had power to bring forth the
[2:13:32] water out of the rock whether it was
[2:13:35] it's awesome
[2:13:39] now this helps us to see the power and
[2:13:41] authority that was placed in Moses as
[2:13:43] God's prophet
[2:13:46] he had the authority to cause that water
[2:13:48] to flow whether it was God's perfect
[2:13:50] will or not
[2:13:52] he said did you know that he said
[2:13:54] everybody will admit that it wasn't
[2:13:55] God's will but Moses done it anyhow he
[2:13:59] had power
[2:14:01] God entrusted him to be a prophet and he
[2:14:05] gave him those powers to do that and he
[2:14:07] found out that his servant failed him
[2:14:10] and he glorified himself in the stead of
[2:14:13] God and then what happened God
[2:14:17] hello God dealt with Moses then didn't
[2:14:20] he he said not with the children those
[2:14:24] chiding children those bellyaching
[2:14:26] children those murmuring grumbling
[2:14:28] children he didn't deal with them who
[2:14:31] did he deal with
[2:14:32] he dealt with Moses
[2:14:35] the holy spirit is given to a man and
[2:14:39] gifts are given to a man
[2:14:43] how about you all read that for me
[2:14:47] [Music]
[2:14:49] but you have to watch
[2:14:53] what you're doing
[2:14:55] with those divine
[2:14:57] gifts
[2:15:03] the next one I'm almost done with these
[2:15:06] he said look you're here
[2:15:09] this is making the valley full of
[2:15:10] ditches the organized church was Moses
[2:15:13] the lawgiver and the law Giver Moses
[2:15:15] glorified himself
[2:15:18] in the stead of God and look what the
[2:15:21] penalty was wasn't permitted to take the
[2:15:24] children over Jordan
[2:15:26] now listen and how he types that for the
[2:15:28] day he said and the church today is
[2:15:31] doing what
[2:15:32] glorifying themselves I belong to the
[2:15:36] assemblies I belong to the Church of God
[2:15:38] I belong to this or that we could say I
[2:15:40] Belong To The Message Church
[2:15:42] don't let me offend you by telling the
[2:15:44] truth
[2:15:46] if you think that is is your your you
[2:15:49] know your trophy
[2:15:53] there's no trophy
[2:15:56] I belong to this or that or the other
[2:15:59] what are you anyhow that's right it's
[2:16:01] the truth now there's good men and every
[2:16:04] one of them we're Brethren break down
[2:16:06] that thing he's talking about the walls
[2:16:09] of division but he said look a man that
[2:16:13] had been with them all along Joshua a
[2:16:16] type of the signs and wonders he was the
[2:16:19] one who was permitted not the church
[2:16:21] group not the organization but Joshua
[2:16:25] was pulled out and took the children of
[2:16:27] Israel across Jordan that's right
[2:16:30] remember he tells us that our Joshua is
[2:16:33] the Holy Ghost
[2:16:40] now I want to move to speak to the Rock
[2:16:42] paragraph 41.
[2:16:45] if you'll just perk up just long enough
[2:16:46] to hear this
[2:16:49] he said let's look at some people that
[2:16:51] spoke to the Rock
[2:16:53] you see we're transitioning
[2:16:56] from bitter belly syndrome
[2:16:58] to speaking
[2:17:00] to prophesying again
[2:17:03] we're transitioning from striking The
[2:17:06] Rock
[2:17:07] to speaking to the Rock
[2:17:09] and so he comes and takes the sermon
[2:17:11] speak to the Rock and it shall
[2:17:15] give forth
[2:17:17] his water
[2:17:20] he said let's look at some people that
[2:17:21] spoke to the Rock let's find out what
[2:17:23] taken place the first man ever spoke to
[2:17:26] a rock was a man that got tied up in
[2:17:28] some theology
[2:17:30] he made himself a set of fig leaves Adam
[2:17:34] he thought that'll do just as good as
[2:17:36] anything but when it come face to face
[2:17:38] with God he found out he was naked what
[2:17:42] did he do
[2:17:45] he spoke to the Rock
[2:17:47] and the rock made away Hallelujah
[2:17:50] you don't hear Brother random talking so
[2:17:52] many times about Adam like this
[2:17:54] this is a powerful position a powerful
[2:17:57] powerful place here he said what did he
[2:17:59] do he spoke to the Rock and the rock
[2:18:01] made a way of Escape for him the rock
[2:18:04] that was in Eden
[2:18:09] he said there was Noah another man who
[2:18:12] had preached and the people ignored and
[2:18:13] laughed at him one day he spoke to the
[2:18:15] Rock
[2:18:16] and The Rock took him in the ark and
[2:18:19] tucked him away in his arms and rode him
[2:18:22] above the storm and drowned the
[2:18:24] persecuting world yes sir Noah
[2:18:27] there was a man named Daniel once who
[2:18:29] was in the Lion's Den he went out into
[2:18:31] Babylon he said in himself that he was
[2:18:34] not going to defile himself with the
[2:18:36] king's me he wasn't going to have
[2:18:37] anything to do with the world though he
[2:18:39] had to live among them people
[2:18:41] but he wasn't going to defile himself he
[2:18:44] purposed in his heart he wasn't and one
[2:18:46] day the king throwed him into the lion's
[2:18:48] pit because he was walking in the line
[2:18:50] of duty but what did he do
[2:18:53] he spoke to the Rock and that Pillar of
[2:18:56] Fire came down and kept the Lions off of
[2:18:58] him all night long
[2:19:00] see it's not just a children's story
[2:19:04] it worked for Noah
[2:19:06] it worked for Daniel
[2:19:09] if you make the transition it'll work
[2:19:11] for you
[2:19:13] if you'll let your faith go from Moses
[2:19:16] to The Rock
[2:19:20] if you'll let your faith go from the
[2:19:22] from from William Branham the prophet to
[2:19:24] the god of William Branham
[2:19:26] [Applause]
[2:19:29] that's not critical
[2:19:32] I'm not being critical
[2:19:35] I'm telling you it's a necessary
[2:19:37] transition
[2:19:39] and if the bride can't make that
[2:19:41] transition she'll stay in this old
[2:19:43] Satan's Eden until she gets the
[2:19:45] authority to make the transition
[2:19:48] if we can't let him decrease
[2:19:51] so that Christ the word in us can
[2:19:53] increase we will miss it this is not to
[2:19:56] correct him this is not to to take away
[2:19:59] one minute from the office
[2:20:02] no sir
[2:20:10] they were someone was talking to me
[2:20:12] about
[2:20:13] some of the different things that
[2:20:14] they've got for people to see in
[2:20:16] Jeffersonville
[2:20:17] some of the artifacts and and you know
[2:20:20] I'm just built differently than some
[2:20:22] people are I enjoy
[2:20:25] I enjoy that I'm a little bit of a
[2:20:27] history buff
[2:20:30] when I saw the cup that brother Branham
[2:20:32] served communion out of it blessed me I
[2:20:35] didn't bow down I didn't kiss it through
[2:20:37] the glass
[2:20:40] but I thought to myself just like I did
[2:20:42] in in Williamsburg Virginia just like I
[2:20:45] do in Washington DC just like I've done
[2:20:47] in many places around the world or if
[2:20:49] that cup could talk
[2:20:55] I'm not offended I'm not I'm not
[2:20:57] offended I I I'm not offended I have
[2:20:59] some things in my office uh that belong
[2:21:02] to brother random I'm not offended
[2:21:05] I I appreciate them I'm just that kind
[2:21:08] of a person I'm just sentimental enough
[2:21:11] that I love those saying I'm so blessed
[2:21:14] when I get to be in a place where
[2:21:16] brother Brandon preached and the sick
[2:21:18] were healed and Devils were cast out I
[2:21:20] love being in a place like that it
[2:21:22] blesses me so I'm not in any way trying
[2:21:25] to take away from the man or the
[2:21:27] ministry I'm just telling you it's a
[2:21:29] necessary transition that the bride is
[2:21:31] going to have to make
[2:21:34] that our focus goes back to the Rock
[2:21:38] and I tell you he told us where to put
[2:21:41] our Focus
[2:21:42] and we better listen to what he had to
[2:21:44] say
[2:21:45] don't they always like to tell me say
[2:21:48] what he said
[2:21:49] I found out if you sometimes say what he
[2:21:52] said they don't like that either cause
[2:21:53] you said it
[2:21:59] just recently I heard some new
[2:22:01] criticisms
[2:22:03] most of the time we try not to even lose
[2:22:05] a Beat
[2:22:06] you just keep marching because they will
[2:22:09] come but recently I heard they were
[2:22:12] telling in Canada of all places the
[2:22:15] place where the Lord sent me to find a
[2:22:17] wife
[2:22:19] that's a holy place
[2:22:22] they were telling you know down at
[2:22:24] Shelley's Church
[2:22:30] you don't ever hear him saying Reagan's
[2:22:32] Church
[2:22:34] or Pruitt's Church
[2:22:38] I have found a special category
[2:22:42] down at Shelley's church he said they
[2:22:45] teach people
[2:22:47] it told us at the Youth Camp last week
[2:22:49] or so
[2:22:50] they teach people to dance in the spirit
[2:22:55] I wish I was a better teacher
[2:22:59] I wished I could I I wish that I could
[2:23:02] teach you the importance
[2:23:04] of worshiping the Lord
[2:23:07] in spirit and in truth but I wouldn't
[2:23:10] ever want to try to teach anybody and I
[2:23:13] wouldn't permit anybody else around here
[2:23:15] to teach somebody how to dance in the
[2:23:18] spirit but I'm not ashamed I want you to
[2:23:20] know I'm not ashamed to dance before the
[2:23:23] Lord
[2:23:24] the psalmist set up Praise Him in the
[2:23:27] dance praise him on the loud sounding
[2:23:30] symbols let everything that had breath
[2:23:34] praise the Lord
[2:23:35] [Music]
[2:23:35] [Applause]
[2:23:38] if I'm guilty of teaching anything about
[2:23:40] worship I'm guilty of this I have set an
[2:23:43] example before this body
[2:23:45] that even preachers
[2:23:47] even pastors
[2:23:50] should Worship the Lord
[2:23:52] I'm not going to ask you to worship him
[2:23:54] if I don't come out here and worship him
[2:23:57] if I can't raise my hands I'm not going
[2:24:00] to ask you to raise your hands we need
[2:24:02] it I'm telling you we need we need to
[2:24:06] get in that presence
[2:24:08] we need to make this transition
[2:24:12] we can preach all day on the Rock being
[2:24:14] smitten and there's no greater message
[2:24:16] to preach that Christ was smitten for us
[2:24:19] but then the question falls on us what
[2:24:22] are we going to do about it
[2:24:25] let's make it personal let's speak to
[2:24:28] the Rock
[2:24:29] the pillar of fire came down and kept
[2:24:31] the Lions off of him all night long
[2:24:33] because he spoke because he spoke to the
[2:24:36] Rock before he went to the pit I think
[2:24:38] oh
[2:24:40] go back that was too good got to read it
[2:24:43] again
[2:24:46] some of you songwriters ought to ought
[2:24:47] to write a song
[2:24:49] and put that in it as a line it's good
[2:24:52] because he spoke to the Rock before he
[2:24:54] went into the pit
[2:24:58] we better speak to the Rock
[2:25:00] because we don't know yet what we're
[2:25:02] going to face in this world just yet are
[2:25:04] you still here
[2:25:06] it's 1 20. why are you acting like it's
[2:25:08] 4 20.
[2:25:11] it's just 120.
[2:25:13] and just remember you won't have to be
[2:25:15] back tonight this is it
[2:25:19] in fact I think about now we're moving
[2:25:21] into Sunday night
[2:25:23] so can I start over
[2:25:26] now you can go on charity
[2:25:29] there was the Hebrew children who
[2:25:32] wouldn't bow down to the images of King
[2:25:34] Nebuchadnezzar
[2:25:37] brother random didn't always say
[2:25:41] that it was Nebuchadnezzar
[2:25:46] that's not always what he said
[2:25:50] when he's talking about yeah he said
[2:25:53] down to the images there but many places
[2:25:55] where he's talking about this image that
[2:25:58] the children of Israel were commanded to
[2:26:00] kneel down and bow he said it was in
[2:26:02] fact of Daniel the Prophet
[2:26:05] am I right
[2:26:08] and so if you didn't bow down to the
[2:26:11] prophet
[2:26:12] if you didn't make him your object of
[2:26:15] worship
[2:26:17] and you spend the night in the
[2:26:22] in the furnace
[2:26:24] but like some of the Bride have learned
[2:26:27] it's
[2:26:28] two as a company
[2:26:31] three is a crowd
[2:26:33] there is a place you have to find in
[2:26:35] Christ where it's not you and your
[2:26:37] pastor and Jesus
[2:26:40] it's not you and the prophet's Ministry
[2:26:42] and Jesus it's you and Jesus now I'll be
[2:26:45] honest with you for me without that
[2:26:47] prophet's message I don't believe I
[2:26:48] could have even found my place in the
[2:26:50] tent with him
[2:26:51] but because he revealed him to me
[2:26:54] you see the god of my childhood the
[2:26:56] Jesus I'm going to be very transparent
[2:26:58] here the Jesus of my childhood was an
[2:27:01] Untouchable Jesus
[2:27:06] I love the Lord with all I had to love
[2:27:09] him with but the but the God that was
[2:27:11] presented to me was one who was just as
[2:27:14] ready to squish me
[2:27:16] as he wants to help me
[2:27:19] everything we lived in great fear
[2:27:21] because everything was sin
[2:27:24] how how desperately we needed a
[2:27:26] messenger to come and tell us that
[2:27:28] there's only one sin after all that's
[2:27:29] unbelief
[2:27:31] so it wasn't in Our Sleeve after all it
[2:27:33] wasn't in our caffeine intake after all
[2:27:35] it wasn't whether or not a woman had a
[2:27:37] hat on or not after all
[2:27:39] it was really more than that so the god
[2:27:41] of my childhood the Jesus of my
[2:27:43] childhood was sort of an Untouchable
[2:27:45] Jesus I I I had a lot of fear that
[2:27:48] wasn't reverential fear It Was Fear of
[2:27:50] what might happen when I called granny
[2:27:53] and she didn't answer the phone I just
[2:27:54] knew the Rapture had taken place and I
[2:27:56] had missed the whole thing but once the
[2:27:58] messenger once that message came and
[2:28:01] introduced me to who Jesus really is
[2:28:04] The God Who had been Untouchable became
[2:28:07] more than just my God
[2:28:09] I realized as we sung this morning he
[2:28:12] calls me
[2:28:17] he not only cost me son or servant
[2:28:21] but like Abraham and David of all he
[2:28:23] calls me friend and he longs to have
[2:28:26] fellowship with me
[2:28:28] so I may not have even known that I was
[2:28:30] to go into that tent with Jesus alone
[2:28:34] had it not been for the message
[2:28:36] but the reality is I can't take my
[2:28:39] pastor in there I can't take my prophet
[2:28:41] in there you can't even take your wife
[2:28:43] or your husband in there
[2:28:45] when you enter into that place of
[2:28:47] relationship with him of an intimate and
[2:28:50] and personal nature it's you and Jesus
[2:28:54] [Music]
[2:28:58] and I was reading yesterday where
[2:29:00] brother Reno said in that Veil you get
[2:29:03] in there that Veil falls behind you and
[2:29:06] you're not thinking about the world
[2:29:08] anymore you're thinking about what
[2:29:10] you've just stepped into hallelujah
[2:29:12] hallelujah
[2:29:13] throw them into the fiery furnace and
[2:29:15] they what did they do
[2:29:17] they spoke to the Rock and the fourth
[2:29:20] man was standing in the fiery furnace
[2:29:21] there you wonder who the rocket the Rock
[2:29:24] of Ages
[2:29:25] Hallelujah
[2:29:27] David said
[2:29:34] little more this is a long one he said
[2:29:36] notice Hagar she's been put out of her
[2:29:39] home she had a little nursing boy
[2:29:40] Ishmael she went out into the desert no
[2:29:43] place to go the water run out what could
[2:29:45] she do she'd been raised in a home that
[2:29:47] was acquainted with The Rock
[2:29:49] and what did she do she didn't want to
[2:29:52] see the baby die so she took the little
[2:29:54] fellow laid him under a tree went off a
[2:29:56] bow shot and fell down on her knees and
[2:29:58] spoke to the Rock
[2:30:00] you think if God heard if God heard
[2:30:02] Hagar
[2:30:05] don't you think God will hear his broad
[2:30:07] Sarah
[2:30:07] [Applause]
[2:30:11] and The Rock poured forth his Waters and
[2:30:14] that baby was saved
[2:30:16] and to this day Bathsheba still stands
[2:30:18] out of the fountain God who has seen me
[2:30:21] she spoke to the rock for her dying baby
[2:30:23] can you speak to the Rock tonight and
[2:30:26] listen to this are you on speaking terms
[2:30:29] with him
[2:30:30] [Music]
[2:30:31] do you know anything about him
[2:30:35] Joshua he just won't come over Jordan
[2:30:37] and made that great decision he still
[2:30:39] the people said we're able to take it
[2:30:41] God said Joshua you're the one who knows
[2:30:43] all about it I'll just let you leave the
[2:30:45] children from now on
[2:30:47] he got over to his first campaign he got
[2:30:49] up against Jericho wall he walked around
[2:30:52] it and said now how am I going to get
[2:30:54] over it how am I going to send them
[2:30:55] walls
[2:30:56] they got all those rocks and things
[2:30:58] laying up there they're bows and things
[2:30:59] ready to shoot and here we are out here
[2:31:02] mostly unarmed just what we picked up
[2:31:04] from the spoil across our journey and
[2:31:06] there we are how am I going to do it
[2:31:09] after a while he saw a man standing with
[2:31:12] his sword drawn or you uh who are you
[2:31:14] are you with our enemy well he's perhaps
[2:31:16] running a story or two together here he
[2:31:19] said now I am the captain of the host of
[2:31:21] the Lord Joshua did what
[2:31:24] spoke to the rock and a shout went out
[2:31:29] and the walls fell down because he spoke
[2:31:31] to the Rock hello
[2:31:34] is there more
[2:31:38] several hundred years later from then
[2:31:39] there was an old blind beggar sitting on
[2:31:41] some old stones that had fell from that
[2:31:43] wall oh my the speaking of the rock had
[2:31:46] done been explained out of the church
[2:31:47] there was no such a thing but he was
[2:31:50] sitting there blind thinking about it on
[2:31:52] the road when he knowed that Elisha and
[2:31:54] Elijah come down that same road arm and
[2:31:56] arm going to the Jordan just before
[2:31:58] there Joshua had spoke to this Great
[2:32:00] Captain and the host of the Lord he said
[2:32:01] oh if I would have lived in that day I
[2:32:04] would have spoke to him too
[2:32:06] and about that time of noise began to
[2:32:08] come you know usually where God's at oh
[2:32:20] I just love it
[2:32:22] I love it when they tell me Jesus didn't
[2:32:24] preach loud
[2:32:28] Jesus didn't jump and shouting and and
[2:32:31] holler and and and and pray wave his
[2:32:34] arms and I said oh no no no he didn't
[2:32:36] have to but everybody he touched it
[2:32:42] I don't know why it is
[2:32:45] but there's a lot of noise wherever God
[2:32:47] come
[2:32:48] here come that same captain of the host
[2:32:50] of the Lord just a few more minutes
[2:32:51] people tried to get him to shut up but
[2:32:54] he spoke to the Rock and guess what the
[2:32:57] Rock gave him his sight
[2:32:59] they tried to make him shut up they
[2:33:02] tried to hold his peace setting their
[2:33:04] shiver and his little bare legs laying
[2:33:05] there in the sun this little withered
[2:33:07] arms and the old ragged coat but he'd
[2:33:09] throw that coat one side to the other
[2:33:10] and took off
[2:33:13] but why
[2:33:14] he was ready
[2:33:17] to speak to the Rock
[2:33:19] and The Rock gave him back his side
[2:33:21] Hallelujah he said that's a warning to
[2:33:23] every blind man entered tonight whether
[2:33:25] you're spiritually blind or physical
[2:33:26] blind speak to the Rock
[2:33:31] he's a sight giving Rock
[2:33:33] speak to the Rock
[2:33:40] there was a woman one time went out of
[2:33:41] the well to get some water she was in
[2:33:43] bad shape I know I'm reading fast
[2:33:45] she didn't follow this you can find it
[2:33:47] she was a prostitute she'd seen a man
[2:33:49] sitting over there against the wall she
[2:33:51] didn't know who he was after a while he
[2:33:52] said woman give me a drink he went to
[2:33:55] talking to her until he found out what
[2:33:57] her trouble was he said go get your
[2:33:58] husband she said I have none why said
[2:34:01] that's true you've had five in the one
[2:34:02] you're living with now is not your
[2:34:03] husband
[2:34:04] he went to talking excuse me she said
[2:34:07] sir I perceive that thou art a prophet
[2:34:09] we know that there's a rock coming
[2:34:11] someday call the Messiah and he will do
[2:34:13] this
[2:34:14] he said I'm he
[2:34:18] I'm he that speaks to you I can see her
[2:34:20] drop that water Potter big pretty eyes
[2:34:22] shine into the city she went knowing
[2:34:24] that she had spoke to the rock
[2:34:26] hallelujah and she'd found water that
[2:34:28] didn't come out of that well to draw oh
[2:34:32] Hallelujah
[2:34:33] she'd spoke to the Rock
[2:34:36] that little Martha the Little Martha
[2:34:39] um
[2:34:40] this is the last paragraph of that one
[2:34:43] time her brother was dead and was buried
[2:34:44] four days out in the grave rotten
[2:34:46] already skin worms eating in his body
[2:34:48] and she heard there was something in
[2:34:49] that City that Jesus had come
[2:34:52] she went out there where he was at and
[2:34:54] she fell down before me she said Lord if
[2:34:56] you would have been here my brother
[2:34:57] would have not died but even now Lord
[2:35:00] whatever you ask God God will give it to
[2:35:02] you he said thy brother shall rise again
[2:35:04] why she spoke
[2:35:08] hello Church
[2:35:10] she spoke to the Rock Amen and it
[2:35:14] brought forth death out of corruption
[2:35:15] and rebuked death and brought life where
[2:35:17] a man had been dead four days stood on
[2:35:19] his feet and lived again because what
[2:35:25] the disciples one night out on the sea
[2:35:27] all hopes were gone and what happened
[2:35:28] they they seen something look like a
[2:35:30] spirit coming to them they found out it
[2:35:32] was The Rock
[2:35:33] and they spoke to the Rock
[2:35:36] new hopes come in
[2:35:43] I'm waiting on you to catch it
[2:35:47] and the way they went
[2:35:49] and the whole thing was spared
[2:35:52] why
[2:35:56] because they spoke to the Musicians are
[2:36:00] coming
[2:36:02] musicians
[2:36:05] Hallelujah
[2:36:07] [Music]
[2:36:09] you got it did you get it
[2:36:11] thank you Jesus
[2:36:20] I've done a lot of reading I know
[2:36:24] oh is it really all right good I'm going
[2:36:27] to finish with it one more
[2:36:33] I want you to make a Daniel spoke
[2:36:36] Adam spoke
[2:36:39] Martha spoke
[2:36:45] Bond Bartimaeus smoke
[2:36:53] yes the disciples spoke
[2:36:56] on the boat
[2:37:00] Hagar spoke to the Rock
[2:37:04] you think it was just for them
[2:37:07] no
[2:37:09] there is a transitioning
[2:37:13] from understanding that The Rock had to
[2:37:15] be smitten on our behalf and because it
[2:37:18] has been
[2:37:19] we're given Authority
[2:37:22] to come back and get the honey out of
[2:37:24] the out of the cleft of the rock Rock of
[2:37:27] Ages cleft for me let me hide myself in
[2:37:29] thee
[2:37:32] when Moses saw the Lord and the glory of
[2:37:34] the Lord he stood in that Cliff Place
[2:37:38] and he not only saw the Lord but he said
[2:37:40] he he saw as the Lord passed by he saw
[2:37:44] his hinder parts
[2:37:47] isn't that what he said
[2:37:48] you and I think of the physical anatomy
[2:37:51] and no doubt there was something there
[2:37:52] he saw some Shadow some image that
[2:37:55] caused him to say such a thing as that
[2:37:57] but we understand that Moses was the one
[2:38:00] who wrote the first five books of the
[2:38:02] Bible
[2:38:03] he wrote them with the Scribe the first
[2:38:06] five books of the Bible how in the world
[2:38:09] could Moses have wrote about the
[2:38:11] creation
[2:38:14] if he had not been there
[2:38:17] how could he have wrote about the Book
[2:38:19] of Genesis had he not been there but you
[2:38:22] see that day on that mountain standing
[2:38:24] there in the cleft of that rock God
[2:38:26] passed by you saw not only where God was
[2:38:28] in that moment but he saw where God had
[2:38:30] been
[2:38:32] and it was because of that inspiration
[2:38:34] that he was able to write in the
[2:38:36] beginning God created the Heaven and the
[2:38:38] Earth
[2:38:39] because he saw where God had been let me
[2:38:41] tell you something
[2:38:43] you love that about Moses I love that
[2:38:45] about Moses but let me tell you
[2:38:47] something about that every person in
[2:38:50] this building if you choose to you can
[2:38:52] see where God has been
[2:38:55] you can see where God is today and what
[2:38:57] he's doing today and you can see where
[2:38:59] God's going and all you have to do is
[2:39:01] look to the message of the hour that God
[2:39:03] has given us in this day
[2:39:06] it's there
[2:39:08] you get this little attitude maybe some
[2:39:10] that aren't familiar with these things
[2:39:12] maybe you pass through you get some
[2:39:14] latitude I don't know why they're
[2:39:15] putting so much emphasis on on that
[2:39:17] because
[2:39:19] that Bible became a living book
[2:39:22] when God began to open up those
[2:39:24] Mysteries
[2:39:31] you know just like somebody else out
[2:39:32] there might have a favorite preacher
[2:39:34] because that preacher taught them more
[2:39:36] than other people had taught them that's
[2:39:38] lovely
[2:39:40] I love that I'm not against that
[2:39:42] everybody can have somebody that they
[2:39:44] can can relate to but this is bigger
[2:39:46] than that
[2:39:47] this was God uncovering those Mysteries
[2:39:50] that have been hidden every time every
[2:39:52] time a writer would try to write and the
[2:39:54] voice would say seal it up
[2:39:57] Daniel tried to write it seal it up
[2:40:00] it's not time yet
[2:40:02] John tried to write it don't write it
[2:40:04] seal it up
[2:40:08] don't tell it
[2:40:09] it's not time yet
[2:40:11] how many of you can be thankful I am so
[2:40:14] thankful to God I live in an hour
[2:40:16] where it's no longer sealed up
[2:40:20] Now give me spoken word is Original Seed
[2:40:25] this is the first message I ever heard
[2:40:30] about 1988.
[2:40:34] changed my life
[2:40:36] and it still changing my life
[2:40:39] paragraph 358
[2:40:41] notice don't read ahead of me this time
[2:40:43] stay with me
[2:40:45] you cheaters
[2:40:47] notice what Harmony
[2:40:54] now this this is one of those quotes
[2:40:57] that's used in the church age book
[2:41:00] it's it's actually one you can find
[2:41:04] you can't find them all they're not all
[2:41:06] there
[2:41:07] but here's one you can find
[2:41:10] he said notice what Harmony
[2:41:12] Jesus never did anything until he's seen
[2:41:15] of the father or the father showed him
[2:41:18] first
[2:41:19] Harmony
[2:41:21] between God and Christ
[2:41:24] see John 5 19.
[2:41:27] so will
[2:41:30] hello
[2:41:34] so will abroad
[2:41:38] what a Harmony between Father and Son
[2:41:43] so
[2:41:44] will the bride
[2:41:46] and he shows her his
[2:41:50] Word of Life
[2:41:52] he shows her and she receives it
[2:41:58] she never
[2:42:01] doubts it
[2:42:03] listen how powerful
[2:42:05] to believe it
[2:42:07] to receive it without doubt look at how
[2:42:10] powerful nothing can harm her
[2:42:15] not even death
[2:42:18] death can't touch you
[2:42:22] somebody said well we we have loved ones
[2:42:25] who die they can't leave one half a
[2:42:28] second
[2:42:29] before they're called
[2:42:31] it's not the power of death that takes
[2:42:33] them from us
[2:42:35] [Music]
[2:42:36] that was dealt with it calvary
[2:42:39] it's God you know the scripture we've
[2:42:41] talked about so many times precious in
[2:42:44] the sight of the Lord isn't going home
[2:42:45] of the Saints
[2:42:47] weighty that word precious there is
[2:42:49] weighty
[2:42:51] it's a well-contemplated moment
[2:42:54] when God takes a saint out of here and
[2:42:56] it's not the power of death taking them
[2:42:58] out it's God calling them in that moment
[2:43:01] so it's not a car accident
[2:43:04] it's not coveted it's not the wrong
[2:43:06] doctor
[2:43:08] how many times do we hear people say if
[2:43:10] they could have only got to the right
[2:43:11] hospital if they could have only got the
[2:43:13] right medicine if they could have only
[2:43:14] afforded the right treatment hello is
[2:43:17] that what you believe
[2:43:18] or if you come to believe in the
[2:43:20] sovereignty of God let me tell you
[2:43:23] something God can get to you what you
[2:43:25] need to keep you here if his will is for
[2:43:27] you to stay here
[2:43:28] if I were you I wouldn't plan on leaving
[2:43:30] a half a day early
[2:43:33] I just say Lord let me be here till the
[2:43:35] very last moment and when you open up
[2:43:38] that door just let me pass right on
[2:43:40] through to Eternity
[2:43:43] he shows her and she receives it and she
[2:43:45] never doubts it nothing can harm her not
[2:43:48] even death
[2:43:49] for if the seed be planted
[2:43:52] the water will rise it up again amen he
[2:43:56] said then I got a great big Hallelujah
[2:43:59] he said here is the secret
[2:44:04] brother Greeley what's the next phrase
[2:44:09] the word
[2:44:11] is in
[2:44:13] the bride
[2:44:16] and
[2:44:21] and
[2:44:23] the mind of Christ to know
[2:44:35] you ought to write that down go back
[2:44:41] you're worse than I am about telling a
[2:44:43] joke
[2:44:44] I always get the punch line wrong
[2:44:47] and you're giving my punch like she's
[2:44:49] going
[2:44:50] you're giving my punch line away before
[2:44:52] I get there
[2:44:54] they all laughed at me all week long
[2:44:56] because of the way I had these brothers
[2:44:58] to read they they said you shouldn't
[2:44:59] have none of them to read you
[2:45:00] interrupted them all the way through
[2:45:05] I said I can do that
[2:45:09] here is the secret
[2:45:11] I want you to take this home
[2:45:14] here is the secret
[2:45:17] the word is in the bride
[2:45:20] and the mind of Christ to know what he
[2:45:24] wants done with the word
[2:45:27] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:45:30] hallelujah okay charity
[2:45:35] punchline
[2:45:37] and she does it
[2:45:40] she the bride
[2:45:43] and she does it in his name
[2:45:48] she's not crying about it anymore
[2:45:51] wallowing around and wrestling about it
[2:45:54] anymore no no no no she's not begging
[2:45:59] she realizes I I'm not an orphan anymore
[2:46:03] I've been adopted
[2:46:06] [Music]
[2:46:08] she does it in his name this is so
[2:46:13] powerful
[2:46:15] I know I was a little critical a minute
[2:46:16] ago so let me let me be a little
[2:46:18] critical again
[2:46:20] if this were only in the church age book
[2:46:22] I'll be honest with you if it were only
[2:46:24] in the church age book I wouldn't
[2:46:25] believe it
[2:46:29] this is a this
[2:46:31] is a quote that is in the church age
[2:46:34] book that we can go right back
[2:46:37] and point you to the fact that Lee Vale
[2:46:39] isn't saying anything extra here
[2:46:44] in fact you'll find that brother Brandon
[2:46:46] was very eloquent here he didn't need a
[2:46:48] lot of help on this one at all did he
[2:46:50] I'm not taking away I'm being honest
[2:46:54] and she does it in his name
[2:46:58] this is the kicker
[2:47:00] this is the kicker this this got me
[2:47:03] thrown out of Sacramento California
[2:47:10] almost 30 years ago
[2:47:13] because I was preaching then that that
[2:47:15] the voice of the Resurrection would be
[2:47:18] in the bride
[2:47:19] just like he said it
[2:47:24] if the voice of the Resurrection is in
[2:47:26] the bride then the bride calls for the
[2:47:28] resurrection it's not her voice
[2:47:33] it's the bridegroom's voice
[2:47:36] because she's one with him and she's the
[2:47:38] word
[2:47:40] and they they oh they all the way to the
[2:47:44] airport they got me told
[2:47:50] abroad I said I didn't do it he did
[2:47:55] I didn't make it up let me show you
[2:47:57] where he said it
[2:48:02] she has
[2:48:06] go back charity
[2:48:10] here is the secret
[2:48:13] got a song Ready
[2:48:14] you sure
[2:48:17] here is the secret
[2:48:19] the word is in the bride and the mind of
[2:48:22] Christ to know how to handle to know
[2:48:25] what he wants done with the word
[2:48:28] go on
[2:48:35] and she does it
[2:48:39] in his name
[2:48:41] this isn't building her own little
[2:48:43] kingdom or making some little Ministry
[2:48:44] for herself she don't have time to worry
[2:48:47] about that oh no
[2:48:49] she's worried and concerned about the
[2:48:51] kingdom of God she's become one with it
[2:48:54] with the Lord one with Jesus one with
[2:48:56] his word like he was one with the father
[2:48:58] she does it in his name she has she has
[2:49:02] she has
[2:49:11] I don't mean to be critical
[2:49:14] but I was in a meeting big meeting one
[2:49:16] time when this quote was being read
[2:49:19] and they did this kind of thing here
[2:49:25] he took the books spoken word book and
[2:49:27] tucked in an arm and they said now this
[2:49:29] is how this is how she has the saith the
[2:49:32] Lord because she's heard the thus saith
[2:49:34] the Lord message so when he says she has
[2:49:37] thus saith the Lord what he means is she
[2:49:39] has the message
[2:49:41] that's true she has the message
[2:49:44] but that's not what he's teaching
[2:49:46] all you have to do is go back and read
[2:49:48] the paragraph before it
[2:49:49] we don't have the saith the Lord because
[2:49:51] we got the book where it does save the
[2:49:53] Lord or we hear the tape where thus say
[2:49:55] the Lord's mentioned no no God's giving
[2:49:56] that thus saith the Lord Authority it's
[2:49:59] part of the restoration of the spoken
[2:50:01] word
[2:50:03] you see if you think it's how
[2:50:07] if you think it's just about a little
[2:50:08] fish
[2:50:10] [Music]
[2:50:11] if you think it's just about a little
[2:50:13] old elderly sister and two backslid
[2:50:15] teenage
[2:50:18] what do they call what do you call them
[2:50:21] Nick or friends
[2:50:24] if you think it's about 2
[2:50:29] 2 somewhere or or just a uh before the
[2:50:32] hand touch it doctor's hand oh these are
[2:50:35] the examples that God gave the prophet
[2:50:38] and he brought them to us
[2:50:42] as examples
[2:50:44] but that same spoken word Authority is
[2:50:47] in this little bride
[2:50:50] we're being tested and tried and judged
[2:50:53] now until our character can be his until
[2:50:57] his attributes can shine in our life and
[2:51:01] then he loses her
[2:51:04] with thus saith the Lord
[2:51:07] and we're going to need it
[2:51:09] by the time we get out of here we're
[2:51:11] going to need help
[2:51:13] we're going to need help standing
[2:51:15] against our own government we're going
[2:51:16] to need help standing against our own
[2:51:18] come on
[2:51:20] then it is germanized so the Holy Spirit
[2:51:23] Waters it
[2:51:25] until it is grown
[2:51:28] and serves its purpose
[2:51:34] they do only his isn't that your cry
[2:51:39] this has not been my week
[2:51:42] I I can't say that I know for sure as
[2:51:46] I'm standing here today that this week
[2:51:47] I've only done his will
[2:51:52] I pray I am
[2:51:54] but when I come to that hour
[2:51:58] that I know
[2:52:00] when you come to that place where you're
[2:52:02] not just letting Lord let me do your
[2:52:05] will but you know that's all you can do
[2:52:08] because you have so surrendered
[2:52:13] you've so let him knock the rough edges
[2:52:15] out of your life you're so surrendered
[2:52:17] that you've become one with that word
[2:52:20] and so so to to think of something on
[2:52:23] your own it's just beyond you
[2:52:25] to do something in his name on your own
[2:52:28] is beyond you you would only do what he
[2:52:31] would have you to do that's how that's
[2:52:33] that is a quick short work that is
[2:52:36] a glorious few days however long
[2:52:40] of a real manifested sons of God on the
[2:52:43] Earth
[2:52:44] now you can put everything in the past
[2:52:45] if you want to
[2:52:48] but I don't know how I I hear
[2:52:50] how creative they get in trying to
[2:52:53] explain that all this has happened
[2:52:55] and the bride's Revival is all going
[2:52:57] either past or going on Among Us Now
[2:52:59] potentially I I can say Amen
[2:53:02] but what I'm looking for is a body of
[2:53:04] Believers around this world who can only
[2:53:07] do his will
[2:53:08] God help me no one can persuade them
[2:53:12] different
[2:53:14] they have thus saith the Lord
[2:53:20] don't you long for the perfect will of
[2:53:22] God in everything you do
[2:53:24] somebody said I don't think God cares
[2:53:26] where we go on vacation I disagree I
[2:53:29] disagree
[2:53:30] I think the Lord plants us somewhere
[2:53:32] sometimes
[2:53:35] I think he puts us in the right place at
[2:53:37] the right time and I think that's why
[2:53:39] people come up to us and while we
[2:53:40] minister to people wherever we are I
[2:53:42] think that's why walking off the beach
[2:53:44] in February of last year or the first
[2:53:46] part of March of last year I walked off
[2:53:48] the beach there uh uh and a elderly
[2:53:51] couple sitting there on the on the sand
[2:53:53] in a little lawn chairs reading a Bible
[2:53:56] study
[2:53:59] and and I'm down there to get away from
[2:54:01] people
[2:54:02] not to talk to people but they look so
[2:54:05] pleasant that I greeted them and they
[2:54:07] greeted me and 30 minutes later I'm
[2:54:09] still standing there talking to them
[2:54:13] she's talking to me about the end time
[2:54:15] instead of they're doing a Bible study
[2:54:17] that they've printed off the internet
[2:54:18] together and I ask them how are you
[2:54:20] baptized and they said in the name of
[2:54:22] the father and of the son and of the
[2:54:24] Holy Ghost I said would you consider
[2:54:26] another way
[2:54:28] she said well we thought we did it the
[2:54:30] way Jesus said I said no doubt you would
[2:54:32] that's the understanding that you have
[2:54:34] but what if I show you that that verse
[2:54:36] says in the name of
[2:54:39] what if I could show you what the name
[2:54:42] is and she said well I sure would love
[2:54:44] to see that
[2:54:45] and then I said to them where are you
[2:54:47] all from oh we live in Jeffersonville
[2:54:49] Indiana
[2:54:52] I said oh you live in Jeffersonville
[2:54:54] Indiana my mama do you know the Miracles
[2:54:56] that took place in your city
[2:55:01] I gave them the address and I said have
[2:55:03] you ever gone by that little brick
[2:55:04] Tabernacle sitting there yes yes we've
[2:55:07] seen that and yes we've heard of yes
[2:55:09] we've heard the name Branham but we hear
[2:55:13] some strange things I said oh yes and if
[2:55:15] you go to Google when you get back to
[2:55:17] your hotel you'll find even stranger
[2:55:19] things but let me tell you something I
[2:55:21] am personally acquainted I have
[2:55:23] personally met in my lifetime several
[2:55:25] hundred people that were in the meetings
[2:55:27] that saw these miracles for themselves
[2:55:30] and heard things they'd never heard
[2:55:32] before and she said mom writing all this
[2:55:34] down
[2:55:36] you see I had to be there at that right
[2:55:39] time I'm not trying to make everything
[2:55:41] spiritual but isn't it
[2:55:44] when it touches the bride we gotta go
[2:55:48] yes I think God cares I think we want to
[2:55:51] be in his perfect will not his
[2:55:53] permissive will I want to be in the
[2:55:55] mountains when I'm supposed to be there
[2:55:56] I want to be in Iceland when I'm
[2:55:58] supposed to be and I said let's stay in
[2:56:00] she will only do his will
[2:56:05] and persuade them different they have
[2:56:14] there's going to be a lot of keeping
[2:56:15] still
[2:56:18] because if we don't know what he would
[2:56:20] have us to do
[2:56:22] right now we just do nothing
[2:56:25] we just hold

[3:24:09] give him the grace to just open up his
[3:24:11] heart
[3:24:12] in such a way that you could capture his
[3:24:15] affection
[3:24:17] Lord Jesus capture his passion
[3:24:20] and capture his affection
[3:24:23] may this old world and all that it has
[3:24:26] to offer not have an attraction in his
[3:24:29] heart
[3:24:30] May every hook that Satan has placed in
[3:24:33] his inner being
[3:24:35] may it be removed
[3:24:38] as graciously as possible
[3:24:42] may he surrender every bit of it to the
[3:24:45] Lord today
[3:24:46] and walk out of here ladder
[3:24:49] walk out of her lighter with the
[3:24:52] heaviness off of him
[3:24:54] so that he can just fully surrender to
[3:24:56] you I want you to begin to tell the Lord
[3:24:58] you love him
[3:25:00] that's it that's right that's what we
[3:25:03] must do

[3:25:07] to serve you I don't just want your
[3:25:09] blessing I don't want I just don't want

[3:25:15] I want to be all that you have created
[3:25:18] me to be all that you have called me to
[3:25:20] be Lord may he surrender to you today in
[3:25:24] every part of his life as you reach for
[3:25:26] him
[3:25:27] Lord the prophet told us we couldn't see
[3:25:29] God not at any time unless God was
[3:25:32] seeking us now Lord you have confirmed
[3:25:35] today that you are seeking Levi that
[3:25:38] you're seeking him and that you want his
[3:25:40] heart and that you want to be his
[3:25:43] passion and so Lord it ought to just be

[3:25:56] spirit of the Lord this won't to claim

[3:26:20] to do it on his own he wants to find
[3:26:22] your will for his life

[3:30:02] we're going to pray over the hawkson
[3:30:04] family let's go ahead and have them come
[3:30:07] and and get in position
[3:30:12] but let's love one another just a minute
[3:30:18] heart's always hunger for
[3:30:23] oh our hearts always hunger
[3:30:28] you are the one
[3:30:31] [Music]
[3:30:38] we adore
[3:30:44] [Music]

[3:31:06] [Music]
[3:31:23] always want
[3:31:25] [Music]
[3:31:26] one now we want to just pray over the
[3:31:28] hawkson family
[3:31:30] uh
[3:31:32] he told you when he spoke the last time
[3:31:35] the miracle that God had performed
[3:31:38] both last year and this year
[3:31:41] and and I don't think it's necessary to
[3:31:43] say but the finances that God has
[3:31:46] provided they didn't come from this
[3:31:48] church body
[3:31:49] to me that makes it even more
[3:31:51] Supernatural
[3:31:52] because if if you all got behind the
[3:31:55] mission and gave that's wonderful but if
[3:31:58] someone else would feel it in their
[3:32:00] heart someone not a part of this body
[3:32:02] would feel it in their heart to sponsor
[3:32:04] them home
[3:32:06] back to Hawk's home
[3:32:08] and this was something God dealt with
[3:32:10] him about years ago
[3:32:12] that they would make these trips in the
[3:32:14] summer and the bank account said it's
[3:32:17] not possible but just at the right time
[3:32:20] the Lord said it was possible so they
[3:32:23] have family to minister to and he does
[3:32:27] he does work at the television network
[3:32:29] most of you know that's where Hulk came
[3:32:31] from he was saved among those Brethren
[3:32:35] there heard the message of Truth there
[3:32:38] and God so graciously gave him to us and
[3:32:42] to Maribeth and these three beautiful
[3:32:45] children
[3:32:47] and I just want the Lord to use him in
[3:32:49] whatever way he has friends all over the
[3:32:51] island what's the population now
[3:32:54] it used to be years ago 300 000 but it's
[3:32:57] more than that now huh
[3:32:59] 360
[3:33:00] 000 in the whole island nation
[3:33:03] and they have over 400 000 tourists
[3:33:07] every year
[3:33:08] can you imagine having more tourists
[3:33:10] than you have citizens but Hawk knows
[3:33:13] people all over that Island
[3:33:16] you heard his testimony on the podcast
[3:33:19] he's got a he's got drug buddy tattoo
[3:33:22] buddies running up the road Buddies
[3:33:25] and you know you'd be surprised how many
[3:33:27] of them have come to the Lord some of
[3:33:29] them have come to the Lord through the
[3:33:30] years
[3:33:31] and uh most of you know some of the
[3:33:34] brothers there you've met him you've met
[3:33:36] brother Ziggy and you've met brother
[3:33:38] Magnuson and and you met brother uh
[3:33:41] Erickson and Sister Christine and you
[3:33:43] know you know that this is a worthy
[3:33:45] field
[3:33:46] and they get to enjoy the beauty also
[3:33:49] but there's Ministry in this so I want
[3:33:52] us to pray over them today and send them
[3:33:54] in the name of the Lord to enjoy
[3:33:58] themselves yes but to be a light and to
[3:34:02] be salt and to share this truth wherever
[3:34:05] they go would you just join with me
[3:34:07] right now let's ask the Lord

[3:35:20] carries I know the gift of music that
[3:35:23] she carries I don't know everything

[3:35:29] bit of it be just as free-flowing as
[3:35:31] that rock was
