[0:00] and he came looking for you because in
[0:02] his foreknowledge he saw
[0:04] that you were going to choose him
[0:13] no matter how good we try to be we fall
[0:15] short
[0:16] of the glory of god we can never get it
[0:18] all right by ourselves
[0:20] so we recognize we just keep falling
[0:22] short and falling short
[0:24] even like the generation that noah
[0:25] preached to nothing good among us
[0:29] evil everywhere it's darkness trying to
[0:33] swallow us up
[0:34] and we find out that there's a god above
[0:37] who loves us who created us
[0:39] who placed us here who did not make a
[0:41] mistake
[0:42] who allowed us to be born in the hour
[0:45] that he wanted us to be born
[0:47] we are not here by mistake we are not
[0:49] here by happenstance
[0:51] we are not here by chance we are here at
[0:54] this time
[0:56] because it was ordained of god for us to
[0:58] be born at this time
[0:59] we must recognize that a way has been
[1:02] made for us to come out of darkness
[1:04] into his marvelous light we must
[1:06] recognize that a way has been made
[1:08] for us to trade our unrighteousness for
[1:11] his
[1:13] hallelujah our unrighteousness
[1:17] for his righteousness
[1:20] what a trait can anybody give god thanks
[1:25] why the train i give god my trying
[1:30] i give god my striving i give god my
[1:33] failing and he gives me his uprightness
[1:38] he said it's a free gift everything that
[1:39] god has required of us
[1:41] he has provided for us if we can accept
[1:44] it as our own
[1:45] so you've got to see yourself not as
[1:48] just a part of a fallen society
[1:50] but you've got to see your own self
[1:52] fallen
[1:53] lost without light without god
[1:56] then you discover by the preaching of
[1:59] the word
[2:00] by a testimony some even by a track
[2:03] that was handed to them or dropped on
[2:05] the ground somewhere
[2:06] they discovered that a way has been made
[2:10] to satisfy the longing that you didn't
[2:13] understand in your heart
[2:14] for a better life for a better way isn't
[2:17] that good news
[2:18] no under the gospel it's called good
[2:20] news this is the good news the best
[2:23] news that there's ever been shared and
[2:26] that is a way has been made
[2:28] and that was not just a blanket cast
[2:30] that was god looking for you
[2:32] he didn't just throw out a net and that
[2:34] was thrown but he didn't just throw out
[2:36] a net
[2:37] he targeted your life he targeted your
[2:41] life
[2:42] he knew you before the foundation of the
[2:44] world help me somebody
[2:46] help me somebody he knew you before the
[2:49] foundation
[2:50] of the world and he came looking for you
[2:52] because in his foreknowledge he saw
[2:54] that you were going to choose him and he
[2:57] knew the only way to make that reality
[2:59] was he had to present himself to you
[3:02] he had to show up in your i want to say
[3:05] awful life
[3:06] god can turn a miserable life an awful
[3:08] life a dark life into a glorious life
[3:10] he can if he's made to to welcome if
[3:13] he's made welcome if you just open up
[3:14] your heart
[3:15] you recognize your need you accept that
[3:18] he is the waymaker
[3:20] that he is the way out he steps into the
[3:23] darkness
[3:24] he steps into the heartache he steps
[3:27] into the problem
[3:28] and he says i want to make a way for you
[3:30] oh you didn't even know he was seeking
[3:32] for you
[3:34] there he was on the bar stool next to
[3:36] you
[3:37] wooing you barry showed up at a drug
[3:40] house for some of you
[3:42] wooing you come on there you were ready
[3:46] to take your life
[3:47] and jesus showed up you may not have
[3:50] seen him but he was there
[3:51] watching over your foolishness oh if god
[3:54] be
[3:55] for us who can be against us
[3:59] if god is working for you
[4:02] there is nothing that can come against
[4:08] you
