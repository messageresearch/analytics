today we're going to the word in just a moment but before we do we have a few announcements that we are going to make and uh today is a very special day it is the birthday of brother chad jernigan would you tell him happy birthday today [Music] and he's happy because he's not 50 yet amen tomorrow is memorial day where we will remember we should we really really should because many have given everything many have given lots and some have given all for you and i to have the freedom that we have today and i think that most of our families have been touched we all have veterans in our families but i think if we go back far enough look look at our heritage a little bit we would find out that most of us have family members that even died in warfare and that is what memorial day is to remember those who gave everything for our freedom it's very hard to watch it being taken from us little by little by little by little when we know that the blood of the veterans the blood of those soldiers is crying out that we could remain free and we have the freedom to express ourselves our opinion what we think we have a situation where there were many who died so that we could have freedom they died under a flag and they gave freedom to those who want to burn that flag it's a very strange situation but it's where we are it's how it's our nation it's our country we don't go along with such as that but we know that those men gave their lives for freedom and sometimes we can't always pick and choose when we're in the hands of men's government i'm so glad that there's a bright church in the earth that are living under a different authority sure we show respect we must we must show respect to those who are over us in our government we pray for them to the best of our ability we want to help them out but we understand that we have a higher authority to answer to and that's god's living word we want to obey that word with everything that's within us so no matter how you choose to celebrate your day tomorrow whether it's a barbecue or whether it's some time near the swimming pool or maybe you're going to a family reunion regardless of what it is take some time to discuss among yourselves how wonderful it is that we have the freedoms that we have in our nation and uh tomorrow is aaron graves birthday on memorial day so we say happy birthday to aaron on thursday of this week is brother anthony chadwick's birthday and they are faithful streamers so we want to say happy birthday to you brother anthony that is also the anniversary of brother peyton skipworth who is with

divorce that split that marriage or sister flo's marriage or any of the other widows that was that was the lord calling and they stood those years ago before an altar and said till death do us part

little bit more about that on tuesday night and there could be quite a number of them we don't know for sure exactly how many but we'll mention it to you and then we're going to have a picnic after the service uh to celebrate my wife's birthday we realize that some of you might already have plans and uh we've had this a couple of weeks and should have already announced that we would do it but we're doing it to have fellowship with you give you a chance to to say happy birthday to our first lady and also because there are some visitors coming in that we would like to not only give food and with feed because they're traveling from so far but we would also like to have fellowship with them they were with us some of them were with us at camp meeting that might give you a hint and those of us who had the opportunity to fellowship with these precious believers we had a wonderful wonderful wonderful time and our fellowship was wonderful and then brother and sister greeley had fellowship with them on sunday and they were supposed to leave but the fellowship was so good and the talk was so good you know when you get to talking about the lord and the sweetness of his presence comes you don't want to say goodbye and so they had wonderful fellowship with them too and we'll again we'll tell you a little bit more about that on tuesday night so if you can bring a picnic lunch and celebrate with us here on the grounds we would love that very much and if you do participate bring a little extra so that our visitors would not feel uh like you know in any way but that there's plenty plenty plenty and uh we wouldn't want them to have to worry about preparing anything when we have such wonderful cooks around here can you say amen all right would you stand again as we get ready to go to the word i want to mention to you that this is the last sunday of the month and that means that next sunday we will receive our offering toward the principle of our property and that's the church building and everything that sits on it that belongs to us there are some mobile homes that do not belong to us they belong to the individuals who are living in them or or renting them but everything that belongs to us is is under the umbrella of that loan and it's been a heavy burden on our hearts for a long time and brother greeley received something from the lord that we should get on that and i'll tell you we did but most of all he did and in three months time i want you to know the total that's been raised for the principle of this property is one hundred thousand five hundred and forty dollars and every bit of that is in the hands of the bank they've got it and we wanna give god praise for that it's a miracle a miracle of miracles thank you lord [Applause] we want to welcome every one of you who are here this morning we want to welcome our regular streamers we are streaming through our regular login system and we can see there that we have believers in the united states canada netherlands japan germany norway great britain ghana uh iceland and we have one that says great britain one that says united kingdom i believe they're almost one in the same and so we want to greet every one of them and we also want to greet those of you who are streaming this morning live on facebook and youtube it's been a long time coming uh i have been the holdout in doing that because you know we realize that what we do here perhaps will not be what everybody's looking for but the truth is there's somebody out there somewhere that's looking for something like what we have every church is sovereign every church has its own way of doing things and uh we have a headquarters but it's not in missouri not in cleveland tennessee not in jeffersonville indiana but our headquarters is above it's a kingdom from above and we want to we want to be faithful to the king he ought to have the say so in his kingdom can you say amen so we welcome every one of you maybe you're watching this live there are many comments that have come in from around the world already god bless you and we also know that some of you will see this in a replay later and whether you're watching it live or in a replay we feel honored that you're taking your time to be with us today would you give god thanks for the musicians for the worship leading for all the songs that have been sung for those who are serving us as they serve the lord [Music] amen turn to john chapter 3 again if you would we're going to the word we want to give the word preeminence we want to speak what the lord is laid on our hearts for those of you that are here today and those of you who are connecting with us in other places we are going to hit a few points that we have covered in the last few services as we move forward we want to do that for the streamers before we read the scripture this morning sister annie is that you god bless you let's welcome sister annie to be here live and in person this morning a few minutes ago i saw joshua coming down out of the sound booth hugging somebody and i'm looking back there to say who is joshua hugging i couldn't see from here because brother steve polk is a little bit taller and but i leaned over a little bit and i saw that it was brother donovan lewis god bless you it's good to see you this morning and your family praise the lord every now and again i hear from brother donovan he wants us to know i hadn't forgot you and we hadn't forgot him either we're praying for him but but he sure helps us to see him in person this morning and all the rest of you who are here john chapter 3 yes we've read this but we're going to read it again it's still in red a lot of it it's still the words of our lord amen there was a man of the pharisees verse one named nicodemus a ruler of the jews the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him verse 3 jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god nicodemus said unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god that which is born of the flesh is what it's flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit there's a part of you this morning that was born of flesh that's your flesh but there is a part of you if you're born again if you're born from heaven if you're born from above there's a part of you that is spirit because it was born of the spirit that which is born of the flesh is flesh that which is born of the spirit is spirit hallelujah marvel not that i said unto thee you must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but can't not tell whence it cometh and whether it goeth so is everyone that is born of the spirit jesus is preparing nicodemus for the fact you may not see this birth you may not see it like you would see a natural birth but you'll see the results you'll know that it's real because it will produce something in your life do you believe that jesus answered and said unto him art thou a master of israel and no it's not these things verily verily i say unto thee we speak that we do know and testify that we have seen and you receive not our witness if i've told you earthly things and you believe not how shall you believe if i tell you of heavenly things he goes on and no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that come down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up and indeed he was that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him listen now might not perish but have everlasting life for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him read that for me might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god and this is the condemnation that light has come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil i want to read that last verse again and i want you to know it's the temperature of planet earth in 2021 it's not only the temperature of planet earth in the time of our lord in his life in the second temple period but it is the temperature of planet earth right now and this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and men love darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil pray with me would you father we bow our hearts before you today and we thank you that you are with us you are with us we brought you with us when we came this morning we thank you oh god for that presence it's life to us it's healing and wholeness to us we felt you as we worshiped you and lifted up your name and sung of your grace and your blood in our life we felt you as we lifted our petitions before you and our brother led us in prayer we feel you as the word is read it's not a dead letter to us it's not just words on a page to us but it has become living bread it has become living meat it has become living drink in the life of every believer we don't take it for granted lord in fact we thank you with all that we have for letting us be gathered under this word today we bind the hand of the enemy we know how desperately he opposes the preaching of the reveal word and we thank you that angels of the most high god have taken their positions in this room and we pray that as this word goes forth today it will not only bring help and hope and strength to those gathered here but that it will also reach to the uttermost part of the earth and we will give you glory and honor and praise for it's in the lovely name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen and amen you may be seated so right now they're telling me that they're on facebook there are already believers gathering with us from india canada uganda trinidad and tobago and uh also out on the west coast of this country god bless every one of you who are there we just greet you in a message called the end time evangelism 1962 i want to start with this brother branham talk to us in those that were gathered there and to us as we have come to listen to these sermons through the years about the born-again experience and i want to share even though with most of you gathered here i've shared a few of those portions of scripture before we get into preaching today i want to re-share some of them as they fit with what we're going to say as we're gathered here today paragraph 57 jesus said you must be born again we just heard him say that in order to be born again it's letting yourself go and die sounds so easy doesn't it but how many of you know death is hard death is smelly there's a lot of things associated with death that are not pleasant and we're being told that in order to receive a higher birth than the one we received in the flesh we had that birth we were there but we don't likely remember it if you're blessed to have your mother alive she can fill you in on the details how many of you have ever had your mother say oh you were so heavy to carry and you my back hurt so bad while i was carrying you and and i had so much heartburn and you were born with a head full of hair and they fill in the details well you and i were there born in the flesh that day for instance we could say chad how many years ago today is that because okay here we are preaching about being born again and chad is telling us at least 25 years ago 25 plus he was there that day but he doesn't likely remember the events perhaps his mother karen has filled him in as we were speaking of just a moment ago but you and i have all shared that birth but there's another birth it's a higher birth we've said so many times from this pulpit that born again sister nancy used to laugh at us she's going to be with the lord but she worked for the lord in jerusalem for many years and she used to laugh at me because she said you always say born again borned again and i said well that's the past of born again borned again it means i at one time was so if you catch me saying borned again in fact i even sung the song borned again there's really been a change in me if you hear me saying that you'll know i know better but i just don't choose better it means to be born from above it means that there is a part of me that has experienced a birth that is not of the flesh that is not of the earth it's of a higher order i love the way that sounds you have had a birth of a higher order hallelujah you have had a birth of a higher order and in that birth of a higher order you also receive some things and we sometimes have to stir up our memories to remember how that felt we knew that we carried a burden and a guilt and a condemnation for our sin it weighed us down some of us carried it for years others of us were just made aware of it and then all of a sudden we we had a way provided a way was explained and we accepted that way and we got out from under that burden but how many of you know the born-again experience is more than just relieving you from the burden of sin it's more than just removing the guilt it's about standing you up right in a position where you can please god and there are steps in that born-again process it's not all just the night you repented of your sin there is a process involved there is a life if you will that is being revealed and for some that may come in rapid fire succession but for others it may be more of a journey and more of a process i dare say church today that every one of us are still in the at least in the closing moments of that process because we are still being sanctified and set straight by the word of god it still corrects us it still guides us it still gives us leadership and we give thanks to god for that we really do he said but in order to be born again is letting yourself go and die and the spirit of christ now notice this isn't the spirit of the third person of a trinity god this is the very same spirit that was in our lord jesus christ he said so we've read those scriptures so many times together it and the spirit of christ come into you then you're no more yours does that offend you when you find out that part of the born-again experience is losing control of your own life you know there's times we resent that there are times on the journey that we may have resented the chastening of the lord we may have resented a door that he opened that we didn't want open and just nudged us into that door we may resent it that he closed the door that we really wanted to walk through but i want you to know it's something to know that the spirit of christ has come inside of you and he's living inside of you and that your control over your own life has been surrendered to the one that sees eternity past he sees the present he sees eternity future all at the same time and he's working all things for our good bless his holy name if you believe that same man so don't resent the fact that you're not your own anymore that you belong to him you are his secular you are his precious treasure he values you above all things on planet earth there's a lot of beauty on the earth there is there's a lot of valuable things on the earth but when god looks at you he sees you as one of the most valuable things there's only one thing more valuable than you are that's me you can say the same thing to me oh brother shelley you're highly valued to the lord only thing more valued than you it's me this is how he feels about his own my we ought to praise him my we have something to thank god for today hallelujah then you're no more yours it's christ in you see the holy spirit paul said i die daily yet i live i die daily yet i live not i but christ liveth in me see christ he said he told us that nicodemus was a good man a church member a religious leader of his day he told us he was about 80 years old a priest his whole life a master in israel but what he was missing was a real god he needed someone or something to keep pointing him nudging him pulling him in the right direction he needed to become aware of a deep calling that was way down in the life of nicodemus that said i gotta have more i'm not satisfied with temple service i'm not satisfied with temple worship i've got to have more and we know that if there is a desire in your heart for more it's the deeb of god calling out for the deep of god and it proves to us that there's more when i know that i desire more it's evidence to me that there is more to be had so don't you get satisfied down here just keep reaching for more of what god has to offer can you say amen he just couldn't understand it he tried to take a spiritual truth and understand it with a natural understanding now we know that natural types the the spiritual but we also know that the spiritual cannot be understood by the natural the natural types the spiritual but the spiritual cannot be understood with a natural understanding so in order for the natural to show you the way in order for you to look at the natural and see the way that christ would have you to go it takes something supernatural help me now something supernatural dropping down so that truth and observation what you see what you hear what you think what you feel like you know it all gets stored up here in the intellect it's by the holy spirit of god that that information is dropped down from our head our intellect our mind into the innermost being i read this week where brother branham said that that beautiful holy of holies that ark of the covenant that sat in the in the tabernacle there that beautiful representation of the throne of god it was a representation in the earth of the throne of god in the heavenlies it was an image a replica and he said on the day of pentecost that ark of the covenant that had once been a box hidden behind curtains and tents he said that that great ark of the covenant was moved from the natural to the spiritual and he said now the ark of the covenant the ark of the testimony is laying deep down in the heart of the believer and as god was once sitting on the throne somewhere else he now desires by the holy ghost to sit on the throne room of your life to guide you help me now to guide you to lead you along to inspire you to reach for more to be all that god has called you to be no one is encouraging you to be your better self when we look at ourselves we don't see much to be better about what we're encouraging people to be is all that jesus christ paid for if you'll just reach to be all that god desires you to be you'll be a better version oh my of what you've ever seen in the mirror you'll be a better version of what you are when you finish a good book or when you listen to a good webinar or when you study self-help and uh making yourself better i believe all of those things have their place but i want you to know you'll never be the best that you can be until you surrender to the god help me now you've got to let the god come and sit on the throne of your heart you've got to let the god come and lead you and direct you so once nicodemus stood in the presence of the god once he stood in the presence of the one who was ordained the same spirit of the father was now in the lord jesus christ nicodemus was looking at a body of flesh but in that body of flesh was the eternal spirit of god he was in the presence of almighty god when he stood in the presence of the body of the lord jesus christ now the god was on the scene the spirit of the lord was there to lead and what happened was a supernatural thing you see nicodemus responded first in the natural i don't know how i i i don't get that how could i go back i'm a big man i'm an old man how could i go back be inside my mother's womb and be born again he was looking at it in a wrong way jesus said i he must have thought and i'm going to make this real plain because he went in and he began to explain it all again and i want you to know there must have been a revelation there must have been something supernatural taking place because i know the church for years has condemned nicodemus i mentioned this a couple weeks ago they've condemned him because he came by night they've said oh he was embarrassed he was ashamed he didn't want nobody to see him brother branham said oh that might have been the case but he said he was a busy man he was a busy man and a leader in israel it could be that the only time that he had to come was by night doesn't really matter today folk why he came at night what matter is that he came what mattered is that he came it doesn't matter whether you come young or middle-aged or old what matters is that you come that you come to him before it's too late that you surrender the ark of the covenant of your life and let him come and sit on the throne and be your god be your help be your stay he wants to be the foundation of your life you cannot understand the natural until the spirit of god quickens it then you look in and you can see so many beautiful types of the natural of the spirit we should say that are that are outlined for us in the natural i love that now jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever let's hit that for just a moment paragraph five and we're going to move on i got to hurry because i want to get to something in a moment so therefore no man could save another here's what i want you to know if you don't already know it i believe if you're sitting in this room today you probably know this but you may be watching this somewhere else and you may not be completely sure how salvation comes to man today i want you to know it doesn't come by a earthly relationship god has no grandchildren it doesn't matter how much mama loved him doesn't matter how much daddy loved him doesn't matter how much your children love him what matters is do you love him have you met him do you know him salvation doesn't come in any other form by any other means by any other person other than the lord jesus christ your kindness will not save you by the blood he said only by the blood you see your kindness can give you can give you favor in life you're good to people you're good especially to the bride you can certainly have favor in life god will bless you for blessing others he will bless you for blessing others you may buy coffee for someone behind you in the line who's not even of god will bless you for that because you've done something as unto him he said that that you've done to the least of my little ones that you have done also to me but the only way to have eternal life is through repentance through the blood of jesus christ and through a born-again experience you can't be sanctified by being kind to somebody you don't receive the baptism of the holy ghost by joining the church it's only by personal experience with jesus christ that our birth is now from above he said so no man could save another if it would have been so jesus would have not had to die but when jesus died at calvary i love this he settled the sin question for as long as you're doing good for as long as you're looking good for as long as you're smelling good no no no no he settled the sin question help me now forever the price was paid not partially but completely it was so met that god identified that it was true now the only thing we have to do is receive this it's to accept this it's to believe it and accept it but no matter how much that he died for salvation we must ourselves accept it look here as our own personal experience i'm speaking to all kinds of people from all kinds of church backgrounds from all kinds of backgrounds i may be preaching to the church and the unchurched but i want to say to those who worship around the message the great truth that god gave to brother branham and that we've received by his grace i want to say to you you must like every other citizen like every other creature you must have a personal experience with jesus christ for yourself it's not enough to say i'm identified with that church i'm identified with that prophet i'm identified with that pastor i'm identified with that truth you must be identified with the lord jesus christ he is the giver of salvation he is yeshua he is yeshua he is the lord jesus christ his name means save us save us and he has how many of you are glad he has we must accept it as our own personal experience our own desire oh yes mama can't desire it for you and get it to you you have to come to a place where you desire it of yourself but i'll tell you what mama can do she can pray like a mighty woman of god i'll tell you what daddy can do he can turn his face to the wall and cry out for you so that you will one day realize that there's a gift waiting for you got your name on it waiting on you hallelujah but you've got to come and receive it for yourself we must water be saved and believe that upon the basis of his shed blood that we are saved after we have met the requirements of the bible he said i believe in the bible being the full revelation oh so much could be said he said i believe in the bible being the full revelation of jesus christ he said now i do believe that god can do things that's not written in the bible because he's god but as long as we can find it in the bible as a promise then we know it's true because the word is true always and so we believe him to keep his promise how many of you believe he keeps his promise i want to say this again and then i'm moving on i want to say that it's the abc's it's a simple to come to christ is as simple as abc you must accept that there has been a way made for your salvation in order to do that you've got to see that the world that that society that men and women fall short of the glory of god no matter how good we try to be we fall short of the glory of god we can never get it all right by ourselves so we recognize we just keep falling short and falling short even like the generation that noah preached to nothing good among us evil everywhere it's darkness trying to swallow us up and we find out that there's a god above who loves us who created us who placed us here who did not make a mistake who allowed us to be born in the hour that he wanted us to be born we are not here by mistake we are not here by happenstance we are not here by chance we are here at this time because it was ordained of god for us to be born at this time we must recognize that a way has been made for us to come out of darkness into his marvelous light we must recognize that a way has been made for us to trade our unrighteousness for his hallelujah our unrighteousness for his righteousness what a trade can anybody give god thanks why the trade i give god my trying i give god my striving i give god my failing and he gives me his uprightness he said it's a free gift everything that god has required of us he has provided for us if we can accept it as our own so you've got to see yourself not as just a part of a fallen society but you've got to see your own self fallen lost without light without god then you discover by the preaching of the word by a testimony some even by a track that was handed to them or dropped on the ground somewhere they discovered that a way has been made to satisfy the longing that you didn't understand in your heart for a better life for a better way in that good news no under the gospel it's called good news it's the vast news you'll never get any news like this on fox news or newsmax or cbn or cbs or any of the other abbreviations you'll never get this kind of news this is the good news the best news that there's ever been shared and that is a way has been made and that was not just a blanket cast that was god looking for you he didn't just throw out a net and that was thrown but he didn't just throw out a net he targeted your life he targeted your life he knew you before the foundation of the world help me somebody help me somebody he knew you before the foundation of the world and he came looking for you because in his foreknowledge he saw that you were going to choose him and he knew the only way to make that reality was he had to present himself to you he had to show up in your i want to say awful life because if we're living one without him it's awful it's miserable if i could just have a new car if i could just get me a bigger house if i just had a better job we feel this way sometime in fact there's some men that say if i could just give me a different wife there ain't no woman good enough for you but the one he gave you there's no man good enough for you but the one god gave you you better teach your children the importance of making the right choice and sticking with that choice it's not always easy i tell you god can turn a miserable life an awful life a dark life into a glorious life he can if he's made to to welcome if he's made welcome if you just open up your heart you recognize your need you accept that he is the waymaker that he is the way out he steps into the darkness he steps into the heartache he steps into the problem and he says i want to make a way for you oh you didn't even know he was seeking for you there he was on the bar stool next to you wooing you barry showed up at a drug house for some of you wooing you come on there you were ready to take your life and jesus showed up you may not have seen him but he was there watching over your foolishness guarding you from making a decision that you would regret in everlasting punishment come on now he showed up when you weren't seeking him i often talk about the testimony of my great-grandmother she she said i wasn't even praying i wasn't even looking for him and he reached down and saved me how is that possible because he knew that she would choose him before she ever knew there was a choice to be made [Applause] hallelujah before you ever knew you had a choice to make he knew what your choice would be and he came looking for you looking for you looking for you he saw you in those dark places he saw you even in those moments when you thought nobody could see you nobody knew what you were doing jesus was looking for you sister jeffrey sings a song sometime he was seeking for me for me because we understand that no man has sought god at any time of his own will if you've ever sought god it was because god was looking somewhere for you and you met in the middle because you had a desire stirred up in your life i got to hurry i've got to move on i want to move hallelujah you got to accept you've got to believe that it's going to make a difference by your faith somebody said i got to believe it's going to make a difference you do because you are not justified by what you say you are not justified by what you do your works don't justify you your words don't justify you it's your faith it's your faith that justifies you i'm a little ahead of myself here romans 10 9 that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shall believe in thy heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved there it is except a believe be confess see the abcs of salvation now i need to read this one that i've already shared and i'm moving along the seat is not heir with the shook i know i'm right where god would have me to be and i'm going to obey him right now paragraph 48 now we understand also that god is perfected in threes do you remember this we just shared it god is perfected in three pastor you must not have any extra oh yes yes i've got plenty of notes i've prepared plenty for this morning we haven't got there yet but i realized that we had expanded the audience this morning and in order to expand the audience i wanted those who are listening those who might happen by this i wanted them to know that a way has been made i wanted them to know that we're not saved by association we're saved by a personal relationship with jesus christ come on we're not saved by following some steps making some promises vowing some vows we're only saved by a personal relationship with jesus christ he said now we understand also that god is perfected in threes now god is perfected in three grace is five seven is completion like the world god is perfected in father son and holy ghost that's the perfection of the godhead or one god in three manifestations or three attributes of one office or three offices in the one god head that's it that settles it no three people no three persons one god one spirit manifested in three offices or in three attributes or in three manifestations but not three persons this is by one spirit the spirit that was in the eternal father he is a spirit the spirit that was in our lord jesus christ same spirit the spirit that fell on the day of pentecost same spirit but in another manifestation it had to be so it had to be so why because god wasn't satisfied to dwell above us he wasn't satisfied to just walk with us near us in the body of the lord he wanted to come and live inside of the believer and that is secured by the new birth by the new birth not part of the new birth not part of the new birth you're still here not part of the new birth all of it all of it now there's also three in perfection in steps of grace to the church justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost i want to i wanted to say that this morning again because i want you to understand that the new birth is not complete without all three manifestations of grace in the life of the believer justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost same god same grace secures it but perfected in three separate works of god's great grace in our lives he didn't just love us enough to justify us he loved us enough to clean us to sanctify us to purify us to purge us he loved us enough to fill us with himself and put us in action he said that consists of the new birth i'm not going to read it all just this part just like a natural birth is typed by it there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and what else that was the son and the holy ghost these three are one there are three that bear witness in the earth the water the blood the spirit water blood and spirit these three agree in one i said i wasn't going to read it all but i i changed my mind now the father son and holy ghost are one you can't have you can't have the father without having the son you can't have the son without having the holy ghost but you can be justified without being sanctified you can be sanctified without being filled with the holy ghost we've proved that in the order of nature it takes all three works of grace not to be justified justification is one of the three it takes all three demonstrations or manifestations of god's great grace in our life to give us a born-again experience so if you're hearing me today here in this room or beyond and you have only been justified thank god that you have accepted the lord called on his name and allowed his blood to justify you but don't you dare stay there allow him to wash you i i gotta hurry i got to hurry let me see where i can go here romans chapter 8 beginning in verse 28 are you still with me do i have a few more minutes i hope i do or i hadn't gotten anywhere yet i don't know exactly how long we've been going romans 8 28 and we know that all things somebody say with me all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified i love this next verse it seems to be the punctuation it seems to be the exclamation on what paul has just talked about these demonstrations of god's work in your life for knowledge predestination the call being justified later being glorified here is the exclamation point on that verse moreover i mean excuse me what shall we then say to these things you win me what shall we then say about these things being called being justified being glorified being having god being in god's foreknowledge if god be for us somebody ought to shout have god before us who what what circumstance what demon of darkness what fallen angel what awful circumstance what famine what bill collector oh if god be for us who can be against us if god is working for you there is nothing that can come against you somebody said wait a minute i get things come against me all the time yeah you do but they don't overcome you they don't overtake you they don't stop you on the way because greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world because i have somebody not only with me as we sung the old hymn but i have somebody in me whoa hallelujah hallelujah i won't take the time to go through some of these things but i'll tell you we were told by the servant of the lord that if you don't have this born-again experience you cannot properly discern the kingdom of god you can't properly discern the things of god you can't properly understand the purposes of god the ways of god the plans of god in your life with just a piece of the birth with just a phase of the birth with just a two-thirds manifestation of the birth you've got to come all the way through justification sanctification and the glorious baptism of the holy ghost i want you to understand in romans chapter five look there with me just a moment hallelujah i know you're tired i might be if i thought about it a minute but i'm not going to think about it verse 1 romans 5 therefore being justified by oh hallelujah you don't get this in the natural therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ how are we justified you know how this became a revelation the church went from the day of pentecost it went up up it multiplied by the power of god multitudes came to faith we read in the acts of the holy spirit through the apostles that god did a glorious thing and added to the church daily such as should be saved miracles signs wonders as the truth of god's love spread beyond the region out over the over the seas carried by boats and ships carried by angelic messengers it began to reach through those church ages it was going up but i want you to know that there was a time that we understand the dark ages where truth was almost lost the persecution of the religious the religious did the persecuting it wasn't the persecution of the religious it was the persecution of the righteous by the religious it caused the dark ages it drove the church in back into the caves it drove the church back into the canyons into the hills into the secret places almost to be wiped out but god would never allow himself to be left on planet earth without a witness of who he is and so even through the dark ages there was a bride you read over there in the book of acts it talks about i greet you you from you you from the church in babylon i said oh if there was a bible believing church in babylon there ought to be one in your city yeah because babylon was nothing but confusion still is today but god allowed there to be a pocket i might preach he allowed there to be a pocket of believers who would not bend who would not bow who would not give in they held on to their faith in jesus christ you know the story during the anointing of the ox age you know how so many of them went to the to the coliseum to the persecution they went as food for lions fed to the sharks they were crucified upside down skinned alive oh we could go on and read of those who were persecuted during those dark days and yet we don't read of a fearful people no siree we read of a people who were so persuaded let me how persuaded are you how persuaded are you of your personal experience with jesus christ these men and women were fully persuaded they went all the way to the stake they went all the way to the fire they went all the way to their death singing nudging one another let me go next we're fearful of a little bit of persecution we're fearful of what might happen if we break an order or if we do something that we're not asked that we're being asked not to do by someone above us in authority we're fearful of what we might pay what price we might pay we're fearful that there might be locks on the door we're fearful of what might actually happen but i want you to know these men and women of god were fully persuaded there was no fear in them that didn't mean they didn't have fear in their life it means they learned how to deal with the fear when it would try to rise up they learned how to reach in you don't do that with a halfway persuasion you only do that with a full persuasion and they said let me go next no no no no let me go next no no no no let me go next we have the testimonies of how they cried out in the flames giving praise to god singing the high praises of the lord somebody in church doesn't speak to us and we pout six months yet there's some of you sitting here this morning you never make an effort to speak to me unless i come to you but i'm still right here this morning to do my duty to do what god has called me to do don't you let anything or anybody keep you out of your place you come to god fully persuaded of everything that he is don't you let anybody darken what you know to be the truth you hold on to that with everything you have because you may need it more in the future then you need it now but then there came a message the church was ruling and reigning that roman catholic system was abounding and i'll tell you it was cheating people cheating them offering them a false gospel hello telling them if you'll drop a few pennies in the coffer you'll spring your loved ones their soul will fly from purgatory to heaven that wasn't some little you know little off doctrine somewhere it was what the majority of people believed to call themselves christian or followers of christ they all were a part of that system in that they accept those believers that were hiding over there for their lives because the church was trying to kill them you know that to be the truth can you say amen you know that to be the truth and so it was only by the grace of god that they were able to survive because there were those who began to say wait a minute this couldn't be right first of all there's no purgatory in the bible second of all didn't the blood of jesus pay the pride what am i having to do and and and didn't the bible tell us as the tree falls it lies what would make me think that there's another place for my loved one to hang out until somebody pays the preacher [Music] then they go flying off somewhere in heaven this was the acceptable doctrine of the day but there was a beer drinking lutheran priest no he was a catholic priest he was a german he had no understanding of god's love for the jews he believed that the church had fully replaced israel and that all the jews would forever be damned because they crucified our lord and yet god was reaching for a man like martin luther i don't know why god uses the man he does i don't know why god doesn't uh you know perfect the man and then use him [Music] except for the fact that imperfect people could never relate to him if there was a perfect prophet as a not as a servant of god but as a man who could relate to him if there was any men on the earth or ever worked in ministry on the earth that were perfect in all other ways never made a mistake never fail never let somebody down never fail to be what someone wanted or needed them to be there would be nobody who could relate to a perfect that's all i know so we found a martin luther i tell you martin luther struggled if you've ever read the writings the musings of martin luther in the agony of his little what you could call a cell in the agony of his little hut little place where he where he lived as a priest he would cry out believing that he was forsaken believing there was no salvation believing there was no hope for him he was a tormented man but god chose a man like that to use him to take a church age that was so dark a truth so nearly lost that it had to be restored are you with me and he found a hard-headed little monk like martin luther and he began to deal with him martin luther spent time in the confessional like everybody else he spent time climbing the steps of the of the chapel on his bloody knees begging for repentance begging for mercy paying a price for his own sins like everybody else did in that day he perhaps said the hail mary's and did all the other things that that his fellow priests would require of him so that he could feel good about himself and one day in his tormented condition he's trying to pay the price for some more of his mess perhaps climbing the steps at the very moment some say trying to pay the price so god would accept him and he's reading his bible as he goes and all of a sudden hear me well the holy spirit of god so loved the world so loved martin luther so loved those people bound by that religious system that was taking them to hell i need a little help god so loved the earth but he said i can't let it go into total darkness it's time to start building back the light well i'm glad i'm so glad and all of a sudden martin luther's going along romans 5 1 therefore being justified by faith reading these scriptures about being justified not by paying penance but by faith in the work of the cross through the lord jesus christ whoa he said what am i doing here paying for my own sin what a foolish man i am to think that i could take away my own sin guiltiness by jumping through the hoops like a little trained puppy dog who am i to think that i could touch a savior by trying to do things on my own when i am now justified by faith i wish somebody would help me justified by faith just if i'd never sinned whoa it means to make or render right or just to hold as guiltless to accept and pronounce as righteous it means to be held acquitted to be cleared of all charges to stand approved and to stand accepted hallelujah you're not working to be accepted you're accepting god's gift in faith to be accepted there are no accusations that can stick against you if there's anything in your life that needs to be made right stay before the lord let him give you another demonstration of grace let god sanctify you let him clean up your life let him fill you with the holy ghost and fire don't ever stop moving toward him oh hallelujah hallelujah give me the invisible union of the bride pretty please paragraph 2 23. i want to share this one god put it in the sea of his oh somebody read that i said somebody read that for me forgetfulness you stand can you read that you stand perfectly before god not on my best day am i perfect not on my best day somebody said the only time i'm perfect is when i stay in the bed no no no a lazy man man that won't work it's not worth his bread so you're not being perfectly in there well i meant when i'm asleep no you won't even be perfect while you're asleep because your dreams will go here and they'll go there and your mind will go there somebody said don't matter yes it matters you can ask the precious holy spirit to come and sanctify your dream life if he tries to bring you back under a spirit that you've come out from under because of things you've watched because of things you've seen in the past that you have already repented of if the enemy tries to bring that to your memory by troubling you in the night by pulling that out of the recesses of your brain and putting you in the middle of that again you have help you have hope you have deliverance if you'll just call on the name of the lord if you've repented of your sin he has put that in the sea of forgetfulness you stand perfectly before god if you believe that same man some here this morning must not believe it but i believe it he said now your name is now in the new book i wish people could see this i wish people would quit talking about there only being one book i wish you could see this your name is now in the new book not the book of life but the lamb's book of life what the lamb redeemed how many of you believe you're in that book if you believe you're in that book put your hand up let's make this an interactive class well i believe it now your name is not it's now in the new book not the book of life but the lamb's book of life what the lamb redeemed not the old book of your natural union but your new bride hallelujah your new life is in the lamb's book of life your marriage certificate hallelujah where your true eternal germ from the beginning takes hold now you're not only forgiven but you're what justified glory justified romans 5 1 therefore being justified by faith he said look up the word it doesn't mean forgiven you need to know that when you look up the word justified in the greek lexicon you will not find the word forgiveness you will not find the word forgiven it's not there it means something else he said the word means justified it don't mean you're forgiven for instance and here's a very carnal example but i love it he said for instance you heard i got drunk and done some evil things and everything and then you come around and say to me you found out i i didn't do them and then you come around and say brother branham i forgive you forgive me i didn't do it at the first place see how would you like somebody forgiving you for something you never did that was a lie brother bannon said they just accused me of that that wasn't true i knew i didn't do it in the first place and here you come in so sweet you get it don't you that's why we needed somebody to break it down for us you come around so sweet oh brother brother shelley i forgive you for what well i know i know in a weak moment it sounds like that you went out and got drunk i'd be lying if i told you the thought never crossed my mind but i must tell you the truth i didn't do it so i don't need you to forgive me for getting drunk and doing a bunch of ugly stuff cause i wasn't drunk i didn't do a bunch of ugly stuff while i was drunk so your forgiveness is sweet of you but i don't need it let me be forgiven for something i've done cut me loose for something i did do not hold it on don't forgive me for something i didn't do he said well forgive me i didn't do it in the first place now if i did do it i'm guilty but you could forgive me and i wouldn't be guilty but yet i'm not justified because i actually done it he said if i did it then i gotta you can forgive me and that's nice i'll be forgiven of you for you from you but i still have to be justified for that but the word justified is though you've never done it the word justified is though you've never done it i tell you i don't think this is a museum for saints i think there's somebody in this room that ought to be mighty mighty thankful for this truth even though we may have it down already it's a good reminder you've never done it he said amen it's not even regarded at all how it's done if god's in god's book of the sea of forgiveness your old book in marriage is divorced and dead it's not even in the memories of god what sin are you talking about he said amen you're justified therefore being justified it was accused you was accused you never done it in the first place the old union is in the sea of god's forgiveness you wasn't married to it to begin with the bridegroom bore your shame himself for you in your place he took your place for you were predestinated for him to be in his bride before the foundation of the world the bible said so you are the predestinated seed i'm going to praise god for you hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah i did have to ask i did have to accept i did have to believe i did have to confess but when i did he justified me galatians 2 16 and 17 no one but a man it's not justified by the works of the law i recently got a email from someone who's a part of the hebrew roots movement who identifies in the messianic faith i like that i don't have no problem i love so many things because it's our foundation the bible the old testament that's our foundation now when you go trying to live by a law like that and and and forfeit what grace is doing i'd say that man and woman is a foolish person how could you forfeit what god has done to think you can go back like martin luther and pay your own way by how you keep a day or how you keep a feast don't you let that get ahold of you i remember saying one time to some who who visited through here uh for many many many years some who even came to tell us that the apostle paul was a false had was a false teacher and we shouldn't believe what he said we should go back to the torah only and all the different things that we have heard through the years well someone that i hadn't heard from in quite a while reached out to me recently and said that they had now received the revelation that we should not only keep the feast and not only keep the shabbat and not only use only hebrew names when we refer to god and jesus and so forth but in all actuality polygamy is part of the old covenant and he was also interested in perhaps taking on another couple of wives [Music] i wrote him back and i said while you're at it you better get two or three more jobs because if you're going to have two or three more wives you're going to need two three more jobs what god allowed in another covenant in another period is not necessarily what you need to be reaching for in this hour especially a man who can't disciple the one wife that he has if you can't raise the children you have you don't need any more if you can't minister to the family that god has given you it doesn't need to keep growing no extra charge for that it's just the truth i said brother why in the world would you they well because it's going to be that way in eternity and so i'm going to practice for eternity and i told him that he needed to settle in salt lake because he wasn't just leading back to the roots of the bible he was leading right off of what god has provided for us in this hour it's a dangerous journey a man like that it's about to embark on come on now and this is how we are sometime we really are this way sometime thinking that we can be justified by the works of the law thinking that we can do what the priest said and feel better about ourselves at the end of the day but here the scripture said clearly knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith the faith of jesus christ even we have believed in jesus christ that we might be justified by the faith of christ and not by the works of the law for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified galatians 3 24 the next chapter he said wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto christ that we might be justified by faith by faith by faith by faith let me give you just a little more in close first thessalonians chapter five are you are you able to sit for just a little while longer just a little while longer first thessalonians 5 23 and the very god of peace sanctify you sbm holy not just h-o-l-y w-h-o-l-l-y holy the very god of peace sanctify you holy and i pray god your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our lord jesus christ now when brother random was talking about justification he said it took a messenger like luther and in the message the countdown how many of you remember the message the countdown he takes these three restored truths justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost and he types them to transportation anybody remember he said justification was luther's message and that was the horse and buggy day but he said along came a man by the name of john wesley and john wesley received a message that was not to cancel justification which was luther's message it didn't cancel it it didn't acknowledge it it didn't cause it to expire but wesley's revelation of sanctification laid on top of the foundation of luther's revelation of justification justification by faith sanctification by the blood and by the washing of the water of the word he said so wesley's age was like the automobile was a little more advanced than the horse and buggy whoo it might have had to been crunk i know it amazes me how we will still say to this day i've got to go crank the car i've never cranked a car in my life i think i did one time in a museum it didn't work it was just for to show people what it was like i never had a car that i had to crank and yet we still say i've got to go out and crank my car but i want you to know when an automobile came along a horseless carriage i'm telling you that was a far advance from the horse and the buggy whoo don't you know people were glad now they might not have been glad when only the elite and the aristocrats could drive them but why when they begin to be available when used cars come out that's what made them available to everybody else when people discarded them for something new then more people got to be apart and they got to enjoy them more right brother random talking about the three manifestations of grace justification under luther sanctification under wesley then he said the baptism of the holy ghost now let me let me remind you who studied this message let me remind you that he said in the restoration of the gifts there is no messenger needed interesting he said in the restoration of the gifts there is no messenger needed you see we have a messenger to laodicea but the restoration of the gifts is what gave birth to laodicea it was in the beginning of laodicea and laodicea the last church agent needed a messenger but there was no need of a messenger for the restoration of the gifts does anybody remember why he said there was no need for one he said because the holy ghost came himself if luther is the messenger of justification and wrestling is the messenger of sanctification who then is the messenger of the restoration of the games he said the holy ghost himself our joshua now yes there was a messenger needed to finish laodicea one who would come to tie together the loose sins of all the other ages i'm not saying anything to take away from that i'm just telling you you don't need a representative when the holy ghost comes himself and the prophet of god tells us that azusa street the holy ghost came himself he just stepped right into the people hallelujah whoa glory be to god aren't you thankful for the holy ghost now we won't get to that today but i thought i'd want to throw that in we'll get to that next sunday but let me get this to you here the very god of peace sanctify you holy and i pray god your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of the lord jesus christ that word holy there is completely a complete salvation one that cleanses the spirit the soul and the body of man the body the soul and the spirit of man john 17 17 is the key it's red letters in a red letter bible because it's the words of our lord jesus christ it is his prayer on our behalf to the father he prays sanctify them i'm going to wait for us to see that because it's such a a precious short little verse john 17 17 sanctify them through thy truth thy word it's truth how are we sanctified by the word by the truth what does the word sanctify mean it means to set aside something to separate something from its environment it means to consecrate it means to cleanse it means to purify it means to dedicate something and here's what i want you to hear it means to regard and to reverence something as holy when the word of truth sanctifies you it sets you apart from your environment it makes you a core chosen clean sanctified consecrated dedicated vessel you have to cultivate that you have to pursue it you have to run after it but you don't do the sanctifying you say well i quit wearing this i quit doing that i quit doing this i quit doing the other oh yeah praise god you did you should have if you did it because the holy spirit was speaking conviction to your life you should have some of you need some of that some of you here today need some of that some of you watching this need some of that you need to yield to the sanctifying work of the word of god by the holy spirit in our life we need to separate ourselves not only from evil but from the very appearance of evil because you've got a testimony at stake it's all you have i wish you'd help me i know it's late i know i'm wearing you out let's take a little nap if you need to i'm giving you permission you can go home watch the rest of this this afternoon we need the work of the holy spirit to sanctify us we need him to help us to continue to walk in integrity and in modesty in a world of excess the world is engorging itself swelling its own self up in its own pride in its own accomplishments and what can be worked by the flesh and the church of jesus christ could easily fall victim to such a kind of spirit as that jesus wants to be your priority he wants to be the one you love the most the one you seek to please the most can anybody say amen let me give you just a few verses here to write down so that you can look at this later but i i will read them quickly first corinthians 6 11. and such were some of you you read it you read chapter six you'll hear what he's talking about but in verse 11 he says and such were some of you but ye are washed but ye are sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god how many of you think that sounds good ephesians 5 25 through 27 husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word ephesians 5 26 that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish how many of you have ever spent time ironing something that is made of a material easy to wrinkle for instance linen you almost ought to give up there's only so much you can do in linen looks nice when it's ironed it looks crisp ten minutes later collars limp unless you starch it and you start leaning and let me show you what you get you'll get a shiny mess you sit down you get up if you've got on a dress the whole cedar dress and all the way down if you've got on the shirt the the tail of your shirt if it's a like these guy barrow or these shirts they wear out made of fine material like that you put it on and 10 minutes later it's already wrinkled that's how you and i would be without his help we would iron it up and wad it up iron it up wrinkle it up it's the nature of the material but i want you to know it's not up to us it's not up to us to get wrinkle-free it's not up to us to get blemish-free it's up to us to accept the work that has been done on our behalf the precious blood of jesus cleanses us from all sin let me show it to you hebrews 13 12 wherefore jesus also that he might sanctify the people what with his own blood wherefore jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate so we are sanctified by the word by the washing of the water of the word by the precious blood of jesus christ which is the word i want to read just a couple of portions of messaging clothes we won't get to the holy ghost but we'll finish this paragraph 109 questions and answers stay with me you said now watch i'm gonna take this little bottle it's laying out here in the chicken yard we talked about this tuesday night and it's full of filth i pick it up that's justification it's just laying out there in the ark got all kind of gunk on it you forgot it you left it laying out there now gunk is in it and on it you pick it up it's just a messy old bottle when you pick that up that's like god's picking you up out of the mire of sin help me finding you over there in the pig pen somewhere picking you up out of that and saying i'm going to use the sinner he said i'm going to use this sinner and the next thing i do if i'm going to use it he said i'll have to cleanse it and then if i cleanse it what do i do to it sanctify it he said the word sanctify made means clean same thing as holy holy is the hebrew word sanctifies the greek word the word sanctify means clean and set aside for service but then this will be next week but then blessed are they that hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled then they're put in service that's the baptism of the holy ghost picked up out of the mire justified scoured out by the water of the word that's sanctified filled up a vessel to drink out of a vessel of service a vessel to be used you've got to have something to give that old bottle can't serve you empty it's got to be filled with something what have we been filled with the precious power of the holy ghost the very life of jesus christ in questions and answers on the holy ghost paragraph 42 my dear methodist brother see the method is under wesley big on the message of sanctification once upon a time now they laid their died easter eggs on the altar at easter but once upon a time once upon a time they were about sanctification are you with me he said pilgrim wholeness and nazarene the baptism of the holy ghost is different from sanctification he said sanctification is the cleansing which is preparation of life but when the holy ghost comes it is life preparation is cleaning the vessel the holy ghost is filling the vessel sanctification means clean and set aside for service the holy spirit is what put it in service you are a vessel that god has cleaned up how many of you are thankful for the sanctifying work so that we can then be filled one last straight as the gate and how he could take that same blood from the body he gave as a sacrifice and sanctify a people that himself might live in i'm gonna read it again you're rushing me how he could take that same blood from the body that he gave as a sacrifice and sanctify a people that himself might live in brother steve that's right continue his work to the end of the consummation how could we possibly continue the work until the consummation unless we're cleansed unless we're filled with the life of jesus christ he said oh god wake up people wake people up to see that grant it save everyone that raised their hand cleanse their hearts lord my hands are up cleanse me oh lord he said this is a house of correction how many of you recognize that's part of the work of the holy spirit to make the church of the living god a house of correction it doesn't always feel good it doesn't always make you happy but oh how wonderful it is to know that the holy ghost is among us this morning doing his work he said this is a place where we should be washed let the holy spirit wash us this morning and cleanse us from the corruption lord this is our prayer let the musicians make their way to the platform and help us if you will this is our prayer this is our heart's desire if you're still streaming the service thank you for sticking with us if you're streaming on facebook or perhaps youtube or something just put in a comment of where you're from we want to know where you're watching some have done it already we want to know where you're watching we want to somehow be a blessing to you we want to know just how far this little extra effort this morning has reached i want you to know this morning you may say well brother shelly i was justified 40 years ago and then sanctified i remember the night that god dealt with me about my life and he began to help me to set things in order and then he filled me with the holy ghost and fire and i've been okay i've been all right ever since i don't doubt that because the word of god is right and it's true and i believe that god has done that in your life even as he did it in my life he filled me with the baptism of the holy ghost in 1975 i got the real one i got the right one because i received him as as he is in my faith as a little child he filled me with his spirit but he continues to refill me he continues to scour me out i still need to be reminded of the demonstration of god's grace in my life through justification i still need to be reminded of the demonstration of god's grace in my life through sanctification i still need to be reminded of god's demonstration his manifestation of grace in my life through the baptism of the holy ghost it's because of that that my eyes have been anointed with i salve that i could see the living word of god for my day for my hour for my generation it's his grace that called us out of of both bondage and slavery to sin and then bondage and slavery to religion and brought us to the truth of god's word but we need the continual cleansing help me now we need a continual refilling and how do we get it we get it by fellowshipping his word we get it by coming into his presence not just in the house of god but even in our home we come into his presence when we think on him when we begin to worship him we were working in the yard yesterday and uh i have a little speaker that i just got that i can put my phone inside of it and and to keep it from getting so hot in the sun because a lot of times if i'm playing music and i leave it laying out there it gets so hot it it'll shut off and have to take it in the house and cool it down but this little this little speaker is a box you open it up you put it in and somehow it helps keep it cool too it didn't overheat all day and it was surely in the sun and i began to listen to some old gospel songs and i just got happy my wife was busy doing what she was doing mariah was busy doing what they were doing and i just got up and danced i just got up and danced it's my yard and the neighbors have seen a lot i didn't gonna scare them i've got a sabbath-keeping neighbor on one side of me and she don't like a whole lot of activity on saturday but i couldn't help it it just got good and i couldn't help it and i didn't care i didn't even bother me that nobody knew what i was doing that was a long time before anybody ever saw me i was they were occupied finally mariah looked over at me and she said i know what she was saying oh dad but i cannot help it i can't be still sometimes i can't i don't know how you do it i don't know how i do not know how some of you sit on your hands when you start thinking about what he has done for our lives i don't mean to break any kind of order but i tell you i can't help but just shout it out praise god for the grace that has justified us sanctified us filled us with the baptism of the holy ghost completing the new birth so that we can go on personal experience with god listen your birth is not my birth you had your own natural birth i had my own natural birth your spiritual birth is yours mine is mine i had my own experience with god you had your own experience with god and if you're listening to me today and you haven't you need to find a place you need to turn your face toward the king of kings and call on him and stay there until you know that he has heard your prayer and that he has heard your cry and received your faith and poured out a demonstration of his grace in your life to justify you to set you free to sanctify you to fill you with the baptism of the holy ghost will you stand with me right now and we're going to worship the lord before we pray before we leave today we're going to worship the lord thank you so much for helping me this morning born again there's really been

a personal sanctuary around you and letting god meet with you he can heal your body in that sanctuary he can loose you from what's been holding you back he can fill you with the holy ghost in that little sanctuary that you build wherever you are when you come together to praise him we want to pray a corporate prayer over those of you that are gathered here this morning those of you who are
