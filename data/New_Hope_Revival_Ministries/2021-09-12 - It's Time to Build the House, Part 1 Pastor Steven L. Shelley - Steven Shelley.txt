and say i have a need we want to remember your needs here today all of you that are watching this service on the stream you uh we want to remember the needs that you have and ask the lord to minister to every one of those needs you continue to remember the family of rabbi friedman he was laid to rest this week and the family is hurting like all families are when they lose someone they love would you please pray that god will be gracious to them and really he was for benny's twin brother and his wife and children to get into the country on such a short notice it was really miraculous and they were able to get there in time for the memorial service pass all of their testing and everything they needed to to get there so we thank god for that continue to remember pam hendrix who is gaining strength we're so thankful that the lord is helping her brother shaw wanted us to know that he has finally tested negative and he is gaining strength i think he's not 100 but he is much much better than he was and he's so happy that he can at least have a moment with his mother and brother uh which he's not been able to do continue to remember the shepherd family their sickness there would you continue to remember this young girl bethany dalton who had this accident up with the kinsers and she went off a cliff on a four-wheeler 20-foot cliff it landed on top of her it broke her back in three places broke several ribs punctured her lung damaged her spleen and liver and uh it was touch and go but she is she cert looks to be gaining strength and healing and it's of course they're telling them it's going to be quite a recovery but we know that the lord is able her dad was finally able to get there yesterday from hawaii where they're living now and will be able to be with her for a few days and then swap out with her mom so let's pray for the whole family you know it reminds us that life is so precious i saw something that hannah had posted that she there she was holding her friend and lifeless it looked like she was gone and and what an impact that has on you to let you realize just like that and so pray for that family pray for brother steve curry i believe he's still in the hospital this week has been there for several days this week needs to be remembered to the lord needs great strength perfect healing wisdom to do all that god is still using them to do we believe that the lord is still moving on their behalf yes amen that's what i have all right we want to take these needs to the lord today reach out and touch the lord as he passes by thank you lord reach out and touch the lord as he passes by you'll find he's not too busy to hear your hearts cry he is passing by this moment all your needs to supply reach out and touch the lord as he goes by just reach out and touch the lord as he passes by you'll find is not too busy to hear your hearts cry he's passing by this moment all of your needs to supply reach out and touch the lord as he goes by our father as we come to you again today [Music] what a blessing that we have that you are in our lives through the baptism of the holy ghost lord when we think about this little course and we think back in the time of scripture when jesus was on earth and he was walking and somebody would reach out and touch him oh they had to wait till he went by them to touch them but you lord have been so gracious to us in this end time to give us of your holy spirit on the inside and at any time we can raise up in faith and know that you dwell in us and you are here to move on our behalf we just want to praise you for that lord thank you that you are here today we brought you with us and we thank you that corporate worship can magnify and increase the glory of the lord around us and we thank you for that lord now god as we bring you these needs they are many they are heavy god we think about those that have lost loved ones and we're asking god today that you would give comfort and minister to their grieving hearts as only you can lord i thank you that we do not have to grieve as others but you gave us a hope and a promise that we will be reunited and we give you praise for that now lord there are those who are in pain today we remember bethany dalton to you lord and ask that you would give supernatural recovery into her body touch her life lord like she has never experienced you before we pray this in the name of jesus christ the hands that were raised across this building lord those that were raised on the stream god i am lifting every one of them up to you believing that you are ministering to every need god you see every little detail today how that it is affecting hearts and minds and and even atmospheres of homes god i pray that you will just step right into the midst of these situations and you will bring relief you will bring strength you will bring the remedy that is needed that you will bring salvation lord as you have already purchased through the blood of jesus christ i pray god that you will set homes in order in the name of the lord jesus christ we bless you and we give you praise lord because you do not change you remain the same and we're gathered here today because we want to hear what you would say unto the body today and i'm asking god that you would help every one of us to have our hearts and our ears tuned to the spirit of the lord as our brother would step behind this desk to deliver the word of the lord i pray that there be heavy anointing upon him that he would be able to deliver without any uh any fear any uh hardship lord he'd be able to deliver with ease the word of the lord we receive whatever you have for us today may we be strengthened in the goodness of the lord we give you praise and honor and glory for it's in the name of the lord jesus christ that we pray amen and amen hallelujah praise the lord you may have your seat today we're glad to be gathered together you know so often after a song we clap our hands and while we're singing we clap our hands scripture says clap your hands shout unto god with the voice of triumph just a few days ago i just happened to see a little uh writing of some sort don't even remember where i saw it but it talked about when you clap there's a vibration that goes in your hands and i got to thinking you know i didn't search it out but i got to thinking about how that the hand and the feet they they there's there's uh points on your hand that correspond with all parts of your body and as you clap and you that put that vibration there there's somehow that i think that it it it goes through our physical body and and somehow it amplifies even our voice or our praise unto the lord and and there's a whole lot more to it but i just believe that clapping our hands unto the lord is is good practice and when we're singing a song [Applause] hallelujah glory glory glory glory blessed be the name of the lord [Music] [Applause] we have heard preaching about sound and we've heard talk about how perhaps that's how that the stones in enoch's pyramid were put there nothing may be strong enough to lift it into position i don't know but you have also heard around here that sometimes we'll change the key to the song to get maybe to what the spirit's trying to get us to and so maybe when we're clapping and singing our the vibration of the clapping can raise that song to another level and move demon spirits out of the way so don't ever miss an opportunity to give god glory with your voice and to give him glory with the clapping of your hands or the lifting of your hands it's just demonstration yes lord i'm coming into agreement with what i'm singing about or what i'm preaching about i'm coming into agreement [Applause] [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah bless the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah lord i give you glory hallelujah these things are not as repetitive and mundane as sometimes our minds want us to think they are they're not god gave us these ways to praise him and he knew every little detail of what he said that it was not just a word on a page just to get people to move god has a plan and he has a way that he can get things done even when we don't know what is happening hallelujah praise the lord glory glory glory thank you jesus well we're glad to be gathered we come together maybe when we're in our secret closet we're praying and seeing things move but when we come together with god's people and we can get a hold of what god is doing we can move things together amen and that is exactly what is happening with this loan on this property you have been so faithful to give this talk all right so 5100 was given this month so far toward the principal loan that would make it 132 762 approximately that was has been given toward this loan on this property and we give god praise for that hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah praise the lord now you get in the mundane of paying the payment every month it's got to be done it's part of it when you borrow money it has to be paid back and i don't say these numbers very often because it causes us to lose steam it causes us maybe to lose heart but we started out at four hundred and eighty thousand dollars the current balance on the loan is three hundred and fifty four thousand one hundred and twenty eight dollars now when you do the math it looks to me like what you have given on the principle is the only thing that has taken the loan down because if i do the math right i mean with the interest that is compounded every month it doesn't look like the payment has done anything you're right and so i just am grateful that the lord is doing this it is him and i bless his name for it he is good now we've got camp meeting coming in in about uh two weeks no week and a half camp meeting will be starting there's some cleaning that needs to be done around here and some yard work that that needs to be done and i am counting on you i'm not going to appoint anybody but i won't be here so somebody's got to take initiative to help to get the building cleaned ready for camp meeting and any yard work that's done somebody's going to have to take the initiative i know that the grass has been cut in some of the bushes and we you know that's got to be brought up to date and i'm sure that it will be but we want to make the grounds look as good as possible and so i'm counting on you and asking that you would be willing to help us to get to the building and the grounds to look as good as possible for camp meeting we are looking for the lord to do something marvelous among us but i'm not waiting till then for the lord to do something marvelous among us i'm here today believing that the lord is going to do something marvelous for me something that will build my faith that will strengthen me that will give me vision for tomorrow and through the week he'll just help me to understand what he wants me to do the the sons of god are led by the spirit of god and not always is it him just whispering the next move but he gave his word to help to direct us and i'm here today to hear the word of the lord before we hear the word of the lord we want to receive the tithe and the offering stephen will you come today austin will you come we'll let these brothers come to you to receive the tithe and offering we want to give as giving unto the lord and let us sing when the redeemed are gathering in washed like snow and free from all sin praise you lord i am thinking of the rapture in our blessed home on eyes when the redeemed are gathering in i will raise that heavenly anthem in that city in the sky with [Music] from all sides [Music] there will be a great procession over on the streets of gold when the redeemed are gathering in oh what music or what's singing or that city will [Music] [Applause] like snow and free from all sins how we will shout and how we will see [Applause] father i want to thank you for faithful givers in the kingdom of god i bless them and ask god that they would see the the the bounty the fruit of their labor the fruit of their sowing and i pray god that they'll see great blessings come back into their lives in every way i pray now god that you'll take what has been given that you would multiply it as you have done many times in the past and i ask you lord to meet every need for this ministry lord i while i'm asking and seeking and knocking lord i just want to say thank you for providing for every need for the camp meeting thank you for providing lord for the mortgage on this property thank you for abundance that you have promised we just give you praise and honor for it's in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen saints will sing redemption story with their voices clear and strong when the redeemed [Music] would you stand with us oh when the redeemed are gathering in we're washed like snow and free from all sin oh how it will shine and how we will sing when the redeemed then the savior will give orders [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] like [Applause] [Music] aren't you glad for the blessed hope praise god you may be seated i'm reminded of the old hymn what a gathering of the faithful that will be and there is going to be a gathering just over the sun just over the hill god has something wonderful prepared for those who trust him do you believe that amen god bless you today what a wonderful blessing to be in the house of the lord we thank you for all of your prayers for those who have needed prayers this week and we're just delighted that god is moving he's moving and he's ministering to those needs we want to thank him for it and uh while brother greeley was talking about the offering there there are some of you who are particularly interested in what happens with the payment for jerusalem and we want you to know that we were able to make i think the last two quarters able to make it without asking for any extra help the lord has done that you've designated your money so that's being taken care of i want to thank the lord for that this week paid this week everything you give toward the principle goes toward the principle you have do not have to worry about that it is taken care of we did tell you that this last month we did not make an extra payment which we had been trying to do that was one of the things brother greeley asked us to do and we've been trying to do that but we weren't able to do it this past month but that's okay it's going to be all right because jerusalem is met and the other needs are being met we just praise god for what he's doing and the past is behind us and the future is ahead of us amen but i want you to know we take it very serious and what you give goes to where it's supposed to go to and if you have any questions you can come to us you certainly can you have every right to do that and we'll make sure that you see look and we might not show you what other people give uh we can show you totals we might not let you look at somebody else's records but you can see yours and you can see what goes in and comes out and sometimes i think it overwhelms people when they think about what it costs power bills and insurance and all the different things that we have to take care of but you know god is so good and he is good through you and we thank you so much for everything you do amen there's a few birthdays this week and uh one is a brother who has never been here with us in church but we've been blessed to meet him several times through the years brother billy paul branham has a birthday tomorrow brother branham's oldest son he's getting on up there he will be turning 86 tomorrow you know that's getting on up there to have lived the life what a life brother billy paul has lived 86 years to have seen what he has seen and to go the miles that he has gone he is very blessed and the world is very blessed to have him reach his 86th birthday i think that's just worth mentioning and the and the only other birthday that i have here from the calendar but if you need to call out one please do is charity has a birthday coming up and even charity has birthdays is it friday all right let's wish charity a happy birthday this morning god bless you [Applause] [Music] we have a host of people streaming this morning we want to welcome every one of you you are a blessing to us i think there is an old friend i think that's who this is who is streaming from poland if it is brother we greet you in the name of the lord it is so wonderful to see your name here god bless you and uh south africa uh the netherlands uh it just goes on and on god sees every one of these we appreciate having you and uh brother peter and his wife sister sarah who've been with us the last three uh two sundays i guess it is are streaming today and so this is their first time streaming we welcome them to stream with us today let's stand let's go to the word of god let me mention to you while you're standing that the quote that we gave you from brother branham tuesday night that i feel like is so good because it's a summary of the end time events and that we made copies i made copies this morning and put them on the back table i even put it in large print for me i mean for you and uh if there's not enough there there's i think 25 but if that's not enough and you'd like to put it in your bible and use it as a reference if you get a little confused on the order sometimes you've got a lot of things going on here and you can get a little bit of confusion i can and uh sometimes i've had to go back and check this one so we wanted you to have that and we can put that on the on the on it probably will be on the app it is it's probably already on the app is it brother it is so uh you can go there and print it you can go to the app you can find the quotes from the services and you can print them from your phone if you have your uh printer connected to do that i have mine that way and it's a wonderful thing to be able to press a button on your phone and it go to your wireless printer and have it in your hand the lord is good to us with technology isn't he amen i'm glad to be here this morning i am i'm glad that the lord came he has been here brother greeley i tell you that was about to lift me off the platform what he was reminding us of sharing with us about the clapping of the hands i was so blessed we're going to wait and see at the end of this service what time to announce the baptism but it'll either be 5 or 5 30. all are welcome to come to our backyard and uh we're going to be baptizing brother steve polk today we're going to be baptizing uh jesse washington who one time told me he didn't see what was all that important about baptism or something along those lines we didn't harass him didn't didn't bother him one bit we just waited and the lord touched him up in lagrange i mean the lord touched him in lagrange and they had to hold him up because the spirit of the lord was all over him after that he said i'd like to be baptized see that was the lord doing the work he touched his heart and i think that's the right way and then ariel we might as well go ahead and start with her now so that when it comes she won't be embarrassed but she has reached that age where she wants to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and that's the baby of the family unless there's another one comes along then then that's their last one to see baptized in his name boy that went over well what a joy to baptize her i had a dream last night and in this dream ginger was talking to olivia and i'm just going to be totally transparent i thought to myself and this is no criticism of you ginger i promise i want you to know the whole dream not not the whole dream but more of it than than the part i mentioned i thought in my dream i thought what is ginger talking to olivia about she's talking to her like she's a little baby her voice was like you would talk to ezekiel or one of these little ones and i couldn't hear what she was saying and i got close enough to hear what she was doing with a lot of patients but i thought doesn't she see how big how big olivia is and how olivia's growing up why is she talking to her like a little baby so i walked over there close and olivia said i want to be baptized that was in the dream and i think a few more things were said and and jennifer said well we'll see we'll see about that we'll see about that and that was the end of it and i thought i'm not going to say anything i'm just going to wait till we get over there today and see what happens and i had a thought in my mind that when we say anybody else that maybe she would turn to ginger and maybe ginger would say well you may not be ready yet and i might see it and i might be able to say hey there's my dream let's let's bring her on in you're not hurt with me are you ginger no please don't be and and on the way to church this morning i got a text and she said i'm not sure i'm not sure if she's but she said olivia's asking to be baptized i said let's do it i dreamed last night that she asked about it let's do it praise god praise the lord i like that for me and i hope for ginger that'll be confirmation she's ready to be baptized that's what brother branham told us if they're old enough to ask then they're old enough to be so i'm i'm really thankful so it'll either be at 5 or 5 30. we'll just see what the service and at the end we'll announce it and we'll go from there but we're looking forward to baptizing that i get everybody i think that was everybody that's asked but if you're here and you need to need a baptism the real baptism the right baptism we'll be glad to help you out i want to sing the one

appreciate your help today god bless you everyone genesis chapter 1 beginning in verse 11 those of you who have a heart to do so would you pull with me this morning hello i'm waiting for a response that was a question uh would you pull with me because i want to get something out and i want you to receive something from it and uh i believe it would be a wonderful thing for you to participate and i think that if you'll do that you'll get a whole lot more out of me and i believe you'll get a whole lot more out of this uh subject this morning it's a little a little difficult to navigate because uh well you'll see in just a moment let's just get into it it's the word of god and it and you'll see that it's a truth no doubt but i want you to make it personal if possible and i see here a brother joining us from romania god bless you i believe that's a brother god bless you in romania genesis 1 verse 11 and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so so just notice that if you'll just go right back just notice that he spoke and the fruit tree yielding its fruit after his kind notice this phrase brother branham enjoyed this whose seed is in itself so these trees that were created there in the garden they had in them the seed of other generations right in fact he said every apple tree that was ever going to be in the earth was represented in those original apple trees that's powerful to me it helps me understand the cycle of life he said whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and god saw that it was good and the evening and the morning were the third day and god said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs let's say that out signs and for seasons and for days and years so he placed these lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and to provide for us signs seasons days and years how many of you can see that clearly in your bible now go to ecclesiastes chapter 3 and verse 1. these are verses that you're more than familiar with but i wanted to lay them again as a foundation for where we're going to go in the word i'm just going to read verse 1. although i like the first eight verses a whole lot we might come back to them but verse 1 says to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven just for anyone who might not be familiar just give us one more verse just to show you how it went back and forth a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted would you permit us to go on just another minute a time to kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to i could hear my wifey amen in my mind a time to keep and a time to get rid of a time to rend and a time to sow remember he said to us a time to re-end and a time demand a time to keep silence and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of peace to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven let's pray together lord jesus we thank you this morning for what we've already experienced in you i i could feel that i i don't hardly know how to describe it brother greeley was talking about vibration i i could feel something like that reverberating in my inner being as he talked about it oh and i'm just thinking about if if there's truth to that and i know there is because i've studied it out myself that every time we praise the lord that way we're bringing healing to our own body and i like many of your saints today could use a healing touch and so lord it made me want to participate in every part of praise and also receive the benefit that comes i love sowing to the heavens knowing that when we do your blessing your provision your healing rains down upon us we are a grateful people today not nearly as grateful as we ought to be but we're trying to be more mindful of every gift every provision every blessing lord today i need you to help me get through this i need you lord to help me deliver and i need you to prepare a people to hear i'm depending on you lord with everything that i know too i'm leaning on you to help us in the wonderful name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen and the saint said you may be seated we are closing out 20 21. we have some time left but when we see that hebrew calendar change every year we know that the year is nearly done even on our gregorian calendar when we reach the feast of trumpets every year and we think about the fact that yom kippur is just right around the corner the day of atonement and the reason why it matters is because it reminds us of a god who is faithful to his word he kept every one of the spring feasts and fulfilled them with his life he kept every one of the fall feasts and he is fulfilling them with his life he laid a foundation in type and shadow and then he came and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us so the shadow first the type first then the reality we are no longer living in the shadow we're no longer living in the type we're now seeing god's reality and his fulfillment we don't have everything that we're believing for but we press on and when we feel discouraged we pull ourselves up by the bootstraps and do it by the power of the holy ghost so even that we don't do by ourself we encourage ourselves by the grace that god has given us praying in the spirit i i know that's not what you want to hear this morning but i'm telling you that there is not nearly enough said or perhaps even known about the benefit of praying in the holy ghost and those of you who are so very careful that you wouldn't dare want to uh use any tongues in a public service we just honor you for that we find that all right you you just do it just like like you should but oh i pray that you won't quench the flow uh so that when you really need to get ahold of god and your mind won't catch up with your heart there's just times that the need is so big you don't even know how to begin sometimes uh i begin an urgent prayer like that like this oh god you know oh god you know i don't know but oh god you know and what a peace what a peace start settling down knowing that you may not know it all sometimes it's hard to get all the information you know here was a girl who had this accident and they wouldn't allow anyone in with her even the friends that were with her her parents are in hawaii and they wouldn't let anyone in the room and they wouldn't give any information to those that were there and even when the family called and said please please let let this girl go in and be with our daughter so that she's not alone and doesn't feel like she's alone and they said that would be against all hospital policies and we can't do that and so you're getting you know bits and pieces and you're trying to be faithful to pray and you just don't know all the details you don't know if you're praying for somebody who's drawing their last breath or if they're stable i finally said let's just ask if she's critical or stable but here is the peace that we have god knows he knows so what if i pray it the wrong way so what if my words come out and i i'm praying like it's critical and she's stable who cares god knows and if i say it wrong he's still on the case but we have a desire to know and when we know not how to pray as we should i'm so thankful that we have an advocate we have someone who will pray through us pray through us in the holy ghost and i need it i need it i need it i have to have that it's a great release for me and my granny taught me so many years ago she said don't ever let the day be over without you have prayed in tongues that day and i said well granny you can't just do it whenever you get ready to she said well i'll tell you how to fix that you just pray in english until you can't pray in english anymore you just pray for everything you know and once you've used all the words you can get i guarantee you if you'll let him the holy ghost will come and pray through you anybody want to say thank god for that there's no intercession like holy ghost intercession now i'm going to say a few things that i shared with you a couple years back uh just a little several thoughts here before we move into what what i want to speak on today the reason why times and seasons and signs and days and years are so important is because god established them he went to such a great depth of of effort to put these light these great lights in the heavens in the firmament to divide the night from the day because this is how he was going to measure out the signs and the seasons and the days and the years we hear so much through the course of a year uh in social media and even in regular media about the different kinds of moons you know the harvest moon the wolf moon the blue moon the i don't know cow moon i don't know what kind of moon they're always talking about it and i don't have time maybe you do i doubt it but i don't have time to research every moon i i couldn't trace all that down sometimes i hear people post and say this is the only time this will happen in the next uh 400 years it'll never be just and i i can't always track that down but when i read it or when i hear about it i always say lord you're probably saying something don't let me miss it i realize my answer is not to be found in the newspaper and my answer is not to be found by google i know that if i should set my heart toward the lord and ask him oh god give me an ear to hear don't let me miss your voice i know that he's faithful that way if you believe that say amen so understanding it all is not always important but being ready to hear remember he said take heed how you hear he said in time what you hear and how you hear we need these seasons if we don't know where we are we'll never be able to determine where we're going seasons let us know when to do what and what to do when without seasons we become frustrated because we do things at the wrong time doing things at the right time is crucial if you believe that say man just in the natural doing things in the right season is very crucial therefore seasons are important now god could have caused the sun to shine all the time 24 hours of the day and he could have so designed that there be no changing of the seasons not in the natural and not in the spiritual but if he did that we would never know many things including when to go to sleep have you ever tried to sleep when it's bright daylight outside i've been to iceland as some of you have and i want you to know it's a very difficult time to try to go to bed at night when it's brightest day and if you're staying in a place that doesn't have blackout curtains you you might feel even energized i've laid down there at night when it was still bright day i've also been there when at 11 o'clock in the morning it was still dark now that's hard to get up and face a world like that but at least it does eventually come the sun does eventually go up and it does eventually go down if we didn't know when night was drawing near we wouldn't know when to rest if we didn't have seasons we wouldn't know when to plant we wouldn't know when to harvest what we have planted so god created seasons are you with me and so we we must cry out as christians i do and i hope you do as often as it would come to your mind and it's my responsibility to bring it to your mind from time to time we must cry out like the children of issachar that god would give us grace to be able to understand the season that we're in right now because you may not realize how swiftly one can come in and go out and another one come right in and you say hey what season am i standing in and we're talking about spiritually because we know that the natural is always typing the spiritual in first chronicles chapter 12 and verse 32 it says and of the children of issachar which were men that had understanding of the times lord i just want to ask you right now that you would allow your little bride in this place to be men and women who have discernment and understanding of the times we want to know what we ought to do we want to know what we ought to do he goes on to say they had understanding of the times to know what israel ought to do the heads of them were 200 and all their brethren were at their commandment i want you to know there were only 200 captains that's not a huge tribe that's not a huge leadership for a huge tribe but god had placed in them the ability to understand spiritually the times and he gave them voices so that they might speak to those in leadership so that israel might be moving when they need to move and camping when they needed to camp don't lose me so that they might be raising up when they needed to raise up when they might need to lay low then they would be directed to layla it was the responsibility of a portion of a tribe not all 12 tribes a portion of a tribe and this wasn't really a tribe it was a family in a tribe and they were chosen and gifted and graced with the ability to understand the times so everybody in a community may not understand the times but god let there be those among your bride sin since we're just a remnant of the bride anyway lord i wish we could all i wish we could all understand the times and what you would have us to do as brother greeley preached to us last week the royal seed of abraham are you still here so you know if you don't know when to do what and you don't understand the day you're living in you might be trying to get a suntan in the winter you might be trying to shovel snow in the summertime that would be in the wrong season well it's according to where you're living right you've been working too hard at something that wasn't in god's timing maybe you're doing the right labor maybe you're doing all the right things but doing them in the wrong season perhaps you've been planning a summer vegetable garden when it's too late in the season to do that it's time to reap a summer harvest so you can put winter vegetables in because you can't plant winter vegetables in the heat of the summer they'll die before they ever bring fruit if you're busy digging in the dirt when it's time to be picking fruit and plucking what you've planted you'll never get your harvest gathered how many of you can understand it that way you're going to miss out on a tremendous blessing in your life if you're doing the right thing in the wrong season or the wrong thing in the right season and so it's important that we ask the lord what is my season what is this season look like for me now we understand that we have to capture this as individuals as individual believers in the body of christ we need to be able to discern where we are for ourselves and for our families then we have to discover how that interacts how that compounds with other people's seasons who are also in the body who are also a part of the family amen because you may be going through a season of grief and you may be highly offended at the one next to you who's going through a season of rejoicing there's a lot of people that get offended if you're not grieving when they're grieving or if you're not dancing when they're dancing but we have to understand too everything there's a season there's a time to grieve there's a time to rejoice that doesn't mean that uh we will always be at the same season at the same time but we discover first let me restate it we discover first where am i in what god wants to do right now where am i what does god want to do in me to get me ready for what he wants to do in us hello it's a very very i'm going to get through this i am i'm determined i want you to hear it and what you do with it is on you brother sister but it's on me to get it to you and i'm going to do it by his grace i want you to hear it and hear it well it's every man's responsibility every woman's responsibility to hear from god for your life what is your season right now are you to be planting or should you already be reaping now we understand that there are so many things like this that can kind of lap over and we understand that there are times that god lets us come into fellowship with others in the body who are going through the same kind of season amen and we also understand that sometimes we get stuck in seasons and we take that as our identity and we own our sickness and it becomes who we are now i want you to know it didn't come to stay it didn't come to stay it came to pass so you've got to know when to turn loose of it so that you can step into your healing right the difficulty whatever it is that you're going through that's crippled you and handicapped you it's for a season it didn't come to stay it came to pass you've got to discern when it's time to step out of that i've had people ask me how long should a widow mourn well as long as she needs to but she must not let that become her identity she's not born to be a mourner she's born to be a lover she's born to love she's created to reflect his love but there's a season to mourn and sometimes you you might get out of it quicker i've had people ask me things like you know in the old days women would wear black and that was all they'd wear for weeks and months after their companion died and they would feel awful when they started wearing a color again you understand i've had people ask me questions like when is it all right for someone who's lost their companion to death to start thinking about it there is no answer for that how many of you know we don't have any rules for that when god should open your heart he will open your heart if god has that for you he has that for you but don't ever think that you should always be in the same season in your life because spiritually they change all the time and we have to be able to keep up with what god is doing sometimes it gives us almost uh whiplash because we come so quickly out of another season and one that is moved very quickly and then all of a sudden we're like a turtle trying to pace our way through the next one we have to just walk in his peace we have to let his joy be a part of our life we have to reach down and get it we have to try to remember that we're not the only ones who have gone through very very dark and difficult things in their life how did they get through it well i don't know how they all got through it but i know how some got through it they got through it because of him they got through it because of jesus and if you and i get through this we're going to get through it because of jesus are you here stay right with me if you if you can so no wonder we get so discouraged no wonder we get so disheartened because we're working so hard sometime and we're seeing such little results and that is because we forget that there are times of heavy intense labor sometimes they go on years go on and years go on and years go on and then all of a sudden you step into a time of reaping what you have sown and boy you want to stay there forever don't you and sometimes that's a lot shorter than the than the planting season to get you there you're just about getting used to reaping whoa you're just about enjoying you know i got a raise i got this i got that you get real happy about that and real comfortable with that and then you go into another season where it's hard labor keep pressing keep digging keep planting keep moving it's not over till it's over how many of you believe that so don't measure your seasons by the results you feel right now because all of that can change and it can change so quickly and for some i've seen that happen second corinthians chapter 6 and verse 2 for he saith i have heard thee in a time accepted and in the day of salvation have i suchered thee behold now is the accepted time behold now is the day of salvation i hold on to that i know the lord is our deliverer i know the lord is our salvation let's look at that in the amplified for he says in the time of favor of an assured welcome i have listened to and heeded your call i have helped you on the day of deliverance the time of the day of salvation behold now is truly the time for a gracious welcome and acceptance of you from god behold now is the day of salvation he was always the savior he was always the savior but there was an appointed day for him to come to the rescue of his people there was a duration in the battle and then he came you got to fight your way until the day of victory and i feel like i'm i feel almost embarrassed to say that to you people because you have fought but i have to remind you you can't stop now you got to keep on pressing in because there's a promise to be found in him so we can say because the word says i can say because the word says now is the day of salvation now is the accepted time now will the lord deliver us don't miss your time there's a very specific word from god for specific people at specific times don't ever forget that's the message you believe don't ever forget that the message you believe was a specific message to be given to a specific people in a specific hour if you don't have anything else to be thankful for you can be thankful for that millions and billions of people living in the same hour that you're living in and god has allowed you to hear a specific message in a specific time and as brother greeley encouraged us we need to hear that ministry we need to hear what god has saved for us and stored for us in this hour we need to hear that we need to get it in our spirit we must be intentional here's what we're missing we must be intentional in our efforts to discern what god is saying in this season we shut him down we didn't like what he said the last time or we didn't see enough fruit from what we heard the last time come on hello if i can get through this part i'll make it you know god's been good to us through the years to help us focus a little bit but it don't work if you don't work it it won't work for you if you don't work it it'll work for everybody around you but it won't work for you if you don't work it how do you work it you put your faith there you step out of your grumbling and you step into a faith-filled attitude come on one that's grateful for what god did it grieves me when i realize there's people here that don't feel blessed it grieves me what do you mean you don't feel blessed without his favor without his without his without him we can't draw another breath oh my i know things don't always turn out the way that we want them to turn out but god is good and not only is he good his goodness is chasing chasing after us you understand it all i do not i do not understand why we lost a rabbi i don't know why we lost a friend this week 62 years old or something like that young 68 sorry 68 years old young smart spiritual a natural seed of king david truly truly a family that can trace their heritage back to king david their their royalty their royalty and he had good days and bad days he had a lot going on and there was a lot of prayer that went up for him and nobody i don't know anybody of all of his friends and loved ones i don't know and you even you people who loved him and who knew him and who he ministered to us here on at least two occasions nobody was ready for him to go but god was god was i refuse you do whatever you have to do to make yourself feel better but i refused to get in that game if he'd better had a better hospital if he'd had a better doctor if he had a better medicine if he'd had another come on folks this is a slippery slope that will move your life out of faith and into fear oh no god knew exactly where he would be he could have been in arizona he had just been in arizona but god knew exactly where he would be and god knew the doctor i think about when joshua when his tooth and all went through his cheek there and he went through so much in israel and we check in first hospital wouldn't see us they just turned us away and sent us out to the very hospital where the rabbi passed away and we go walking in there the blood's still running down his chin we're going to have to have a plastic surgeon we're going to have to have this we're going to have to have that we're feeling fearful as parents all these kind of thing we get in there they start questioning us take us ahead of all those people in the waiting room and finally a doctor comes in and says i don't believe this but the leading pediatric plastic surgeon in the nation was in the parking garage on his way home he's not even normally at this hospital and we have called him and he's coming up to take a look has god done things like that in your life now tell me god didn't know what he was doing tell me that accident took god by surprise no no no he had the right one at the right time at the right place to give us what we needed don't you allow your life your mind your thoughts to go down that slope i truly believe that the hospitals are a very dangerous place to be right now but i want you to know that if god is with you it doesn't matter whether you're in the lion's den or whether you're in the icu there's not one thing the enemy is going to be able to do to you until god says so there's a time to be born and there's a time to die somebody said am i supposed to feel good about that it's the only way for you to have peace for your own future it's the only way to have peace for your own future is to put your faith and your trust and your hope in him and i'm telling you this is an hour to put your faith where your mouth has been what you've said we're now being tested on what we have said and god's giving us an opportunity to prove yes i'll trust him though he slay me though he slay me yet i will trust him oh what other choice do i have what other choice do you have we have none can somebody say we have none this this was all sort of stirring in my spirit thank you for your prayers i've been teaching a class on wednesdays on zoom i was so nervous about zoom i'd never i know i'm the only person in the whole world that didn't know how to do zoom because that's been the way but i didn't know how and it made me nervous thank god for hulk thank god for those who can help you get through it but i've been teaching my class on wednesdays and that this is some of what has been stirring in my heart and uh i shared with him in the first class about the vision of those climbing mount zion and swallowing the fire this week when we came on they told me there's a lady here who had painted a picture prior to the class of the mountain and fire coming out of the mountain as a confirmation boy that'll stir you that'll stir you to know that god was laying a foundation and that caused her to want to hear and that caused others to want to hear that's how god works so i've been kind of stirred in some of those things that i was sharing and i read to them just like i read to you recently luke chapter 4 and this great especially verse 19 but it's just too good not to read 18 and 19 he is receiving the scroll of isaiah he has opened it up and the place has been found where he should read and he reads the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised and then verse 19 to pray why don't we read it together it's short to preach the acceptable year of the lord now everybody in this room has not been called to preach with words or to preach behind a desk but every person in this room has been called to preach with your life we are and we do sometimes it's pretty rotten sermons but we're preaching you know we're preaching to those we work with we're preaching to those that we are in fellowship with those that we meet along the way we're preaching at those who cut us off folks i i don't think that i'm wrong in this but i've never seen i've never seen anything quite like what i've been seeing in this la with people driving you be careful please please please please be careful my grandfather told my mother when she was learning to drive it's not just watching for yourself it's watching for everybody else i tell you it seems more true now i've watched people's driving get worse through the years but i've never seen anything quite like this i meet people every day that's not an exaggeration every day on my side of the road especially out through here especially 379 and 250. of all the places i go those are two of the worst places that i drive where people are literally over and you pass them of course i don't want to mention those people that will stop right in the middle of the road when you don't have time to put on brakes because of turtles crossing the road i don't have nothing against turtles do you but i like people i think a people's life is a lot more important than that little turtle's life if you can pull over in safety and help that little turtle i believe god will bless you for doing that but if you're gonna put somebody else in harm's way to save that turtle just swerve a little bit and keep right on going let's see brother skip was telling us about an experience he had and i had one on the way home last night very similar to yours where we almost did the very almost the same thing happened to you happen to us you're just you just have to watch you just have to be alert because it's so dangerous and people's minds are so distracted and and they're pull out they'll see you coming and pull out in front of you and how you sail by them preaches how you look at them when they go by when you go by them it preaches every one of us is preaching with our words with our lives with our attitudes with our actions our families are watching us our neighbors are watching us we have no excuse but to reflect the goodness of god and what he has done in our life i'm so thankful to be able to recognize that there are certain seasons to preach certain things there are certain seasons to receive certain truths if we could ever get a body a group of people at the same place ready to hear the same thing at the same time we would have no troubles just think about it but it's nearly impossible and god knows that he knew that when he chose the foolishness of preaching don't sleep yet wake your neighbor not quite yet i want you to hold on a little while longer god knew that when he chose the foolishness of preaching if we could get everybody ready to hear the same thing at the same time maybe we could really go someplace but that's not the way it's been designed it's designed that we are in different seasons and cycles of our life and some of us don't even know what season we're in or what cycle we're in we don't even know how to define it therefore we have no idea how to work with anybody else to cooperate with anybody else we don't know how to be a part of community i'm going to preach a little bit here we don't know how to be a part of a bigger family we don't know how to think about others and how what we do really matters you know you ever notice sometimes like newlyweds or something like that as soon as they get married and their little lives begin to grow and blossom and bud they forget about how quickly they forget about those others behind them that ain't married yet have you ever noticed anything like that don't get quiet michael hear me you all made me be obvious i wasn't even trying to be obvious david hear me i'm just talking about something i've noticed in in life and you move up into a new class you're in the married class now well let me remind you married people everybody around you is not married so you ought to be careful about how you preach because those some of those other single people there that hadn't quite made it to your place they struggle with the same thoughts and desires that you struggled with so we don't see you rubbing on each other there's a time and a season for that there's a place for that don't forget where you came from don't forget who helped you get to where you are don't forget your old crew bring them with you the best you can pray for them and help them along the way come on now but your life is preaching your intimacy is private it's not public it's not for church it's not for where church people are gathered i don't mean a peck on the cheek i don't mean a gentle touch i don't mean that i think you know what i mean we're not all in the same season some people are struggling they're not married and they're struggling just like you are struggling i could go on i could go through so many examples i don't mean to pick on the widows this morning but it's another example when a woman loses her husband her seasons change and many times they have been close to other married couples and now all of a sudden i'm not a couple anymore do you understand seasons change so it behooves us as a family of god to be sensitive to that kind of a thing and say hey now how many of you know nobody likes to be a loose wheel extra wheel spare tire i'll get it out in a minute nobody likes to be that but sometimes we have to do a little pulling to pull people back because listen your season right now is not your full identity what you're going through right now is not all you are and it doesn't define your future you are going through and walking through this season in cycle because god wants to talk to you he wants to work in your life he wants to move on your behalf he wants to help you what you may feel like is the most difficult season of your life may only be the preamble for even a darker one and a more difficult one so you want to get all you can out of where you are and you want to look forward with hope you want to believe that god has something and that you're preaching counts and that your life counts even if it's not in the pulpit and you want to show people that jesus is always the answer he's the answer in 2021 he's the answer in 2022. he's the answer in 5781 he's the answer in 5782 and the truth is the truth whether you can amend it or not the truth is the truth whether you can put your little amen in it or not it's going to stand when the world is on fire no doubt about it look at hebrews 1 1 god who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets in the amplified it says well i got to hurry in the amplified it says and many separate revelations each of which set forth a portion of the truth and in different ways god spoke of old to our forefathers in and by the prophets separate revelations and each of those separate revelations only bringing forth a portion of the truth and then truth has to lay on truth has to lay on truth has to lay on truth line upon line and precept upon precept do you understand that and i want to want to call your attention to the word in the king james divers diverse manners god doesn't just speak in one way i want you to hear it god speaks in many many many ways he would love to speak to you from behind this desk that's how god would love to speak to you time and time and time again because there are seasons in your life when you can't hear him for yourself i've been there you're preaching down to me no not at all i'm telling you i've been there so i know what it feels like and he would like to be able to talk but sometimes we're not in a season to be able to hear from this desk so he has to use other things he's got so many voices we don't know how to list them all he has so many diverse ways of speaking to us even prophetically he speaks to us prophetically in nature sometimes doesn't he he does lots of things lots of things isaiah 28 i want to read these scriptures i wish that you would write them down because we won't have time to talk about them each but i i wish you'd mark them down and look at them later isaiah 28 9-10 whom shall he teach knowledge and whom shall he make to understand doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast are you one of those are you one of those has been weaned from the from the milk and drawn from the breast for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept lying upon line lying upon line here a little and there a little it's not god giving all to one it's god giving pieces to each one who has a heart to hear remember first we discover where we are in our season what's my season what am i walking through right now how is god talking to me how does he desire to talk to me what is he trying to accomplish in my life right now then we have to consider how does that work how do i place that with the body you may be going through the long dark night of the soul no one else in the building may be going through the long dark night of the soul come on it's hard it's hard to be the only one it's hard to be the only one you've got to figure out how how do i not pull completely away from the rest of the body and then we as a body we have to be able to discern what's my season and how do i how do i walk it out and how do i relate to somebody who's in the long dark night of the soul come on what is what is my ministry what is my responsibility in an hour like that now i understand that people many people are not open to really any kind of ministry except a pat on the back and for someone to tell them how good they're doing but we have to be willing sometime to receive whatever the lord is giving us because it's the only way we can grow in him i think god knows that don't you he said in isaiah 28 9. uh we read that did we do it in uh amplified for it is his prophets repeating over and over precept upon precept you said people get tired of clapping their hands they're tired of raising their hand tired of two songs in an offering tired of i want you to know this is just the way things come i get tired of hearing if we're preaching a long series on the mind i'm tired of hearing i'm tired of hearing on the thoughts now i've had enough of that ready to go on something every time i come that's what he's preaching on but this is somehow oftentimes the way god chooses to build things in us because he's working on a building he's working on a building he's working on a building because you can't work on one if he's not unless the lord built a house those who labor labor in vain is that right psalm 75 and 2 in the amplified when the proper time has come for executing my judgments i will judge uprightly says the lord you don't have to worry about his ability to give both justice and judgment he will do both in his time do you believe that go to luke 13 with me quickly verse 34. it's uh not quite one but very close i'm gonna need another one of these please pretty please oh jerusalem jerusalem which killeth the prophets and stone is them that are sent unto thee how often would i have gathered thy children together as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings and ye would not can i read it again oh jerusalem jerusalem which killeth the prophets and stone is them that are sent unto thee how often would i have gathered thy children together as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings thank you and ye would not this is jesus is savior this is messiah this is creator sitting on a hill are you with me looking over the city that he loves so much he's weeping over her he goes on to say behold your house is left unto you desolate and verily i say unto you you shall not see me until the time come when you shall say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord and do you know what he did he left the city that he loved so much to seek a people to find the people who were prepared to hear the message that he had to deliver that breaks my heart i know there was no place on the earth that he loved anymore that he loved the city of jerusalem how do you know that because papa in him did the eternal spirit of the father that was in our lord jesus christ he loved the city of jerusalem but there was such a a a complacency and even a religious indignation that so uh resisted the messages of truth that god would send to that people as as a community as a city he would send his word again and again and again and jesus said i just wanted to gather you under my wings i just wanted to tuck you under my breast my chest and hold you up close and tell you you are mine but you would not you wouldn't let me draw you you refused my invitation you chose rather to live in an unsafe environment when you could have come and tabernacled right here under my arms under my loving care and i say to you jerusalem you'll not see me again until you hear those word behold he comes we know exactly he's talking about his triumphant entry where did he go he went out into the villages and into the highways and the highways into the galil and he began to preach to those prepared to hear his message but it broke his heart to be rejected by the people by the place by the city that he loved so much what was the problem what was the problem luke 19 44. here's the problem this is the problem and shall lay these even with the ground and thy children within thee and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation i want you just to meditate on that a minute you that are with me just meditate on that just a moment you're gonna lose the holiest thing that you have clung to all of these years you're going to lose your temple you're going to lose your church listen how many of you at least in the media you have walked through congress with uh congregations around especially through the south that lose their church in a fire or lose their church in a tornado and you see those posts and people say and pray for our church and pray for us and and i've even seen clips of services where the pastor stands out in the parking lot on the sunday after and he says we're more than a building it'll touch your heart it'll make you want to send something on a on a gofund or whatever you find it'll make you want to help them not too long ago a united pentecostal church down around mississippi just burned to the ground and beautiful facility lost and those people just standing in the parking lot huddled together weeping that touches my heart we know that the church is not a building but we also know we appreciate the comfortable place that god gives us to worship and they're not grieving and will not always grieve like that they won't always be in that place of loss because god will make a way they'll build it again they'll build it better they'll correct the problems with the old but in that moment oh any of you ever lost your home to fire sister theresa horrible awful your your memories you wonder you know your records your your part of papers your picture albums the things that make up who you are all gone in some cases lives lost and you're having to start over and jesus is standing in the midst of his own people and he's saying to them you you see this temple look around at all this everything you see now it won't always look like this there will be a time when one stone will not even be laying on top of another stone i'm telling you that's a lot of destruction and here's why it has to happen it has to happen because you trusted a building you trusted the norm you trusted status quo you trusted the way you had always done it and when your answer came and walked among you you didn't see him you missed the day of thy visitation this is why jesus was weeping over jerusalem in luke chapter 13 because he knew the time would come that the temple would be gone that everything the people loved would be taken from them and in the moment listen prior to that is when he wanted to draw them prior to that is when he wanted to draw them up and they wouldn't go i don't know if you all know the name r.c wetzel or not but he pastored riverview assembly of god church for so many years he was the pastor responsible for helping pastor kilpatrick who was down at the brownsville church in pensacola florida he was his mentor he was somewhat of a mentor of mine when i was a boy he had survived polio he had been through a lot and there was a great fire that destroyed his his family's home and and the barn and it so affected him as a grown man it still affected him those childhood memories i remember hearing him limp to the pulpit uh still crippled from polio he would limp to the pulpit he would preach and teach and tell us some wonderful things that god had done in his life and i love to hear him talk about that that fire i liked one part of it so so good he said the house gone the barn gone just smoldering embers left and uh he said we went out and the livestock gone the pet's gone the quilt's gone everything gone and he said sitting right in the door of a barn of the barn was a mother hen charred to death her feathers melted on her little frame but still in place he said i didn't mean any harm but i could not imagine what made that little mother stop at the door of that barn she was three inches from life three inches from safety what in the world made her stop right in the doorway of the barn and he said i didn't mean no harm but i just took the edge of my boot and i kicked her over just tapped her over and out from under her run a whole brood of little chickens he said i never had to question again i knew immediately why that mother could have made it to safety but she wasn't sure that her children couldn't make it to safety and then i would hear brother wetzel say oh jerusalem jerusalem and my mind would go back to jesus jerusalem jerusalem how often i would have gathered you as a hen with her own and you would not and because of that not one stone is going to stand on top of another stone when we're through because this city is going to shake like it has never shook before why why boiling it down to this jerusalem missed the day of her visitation how is it possible i don't know i don't know but jesus said she missed the day of her visitation and she paid the price for it would you agree in a message jehovah jireh i'm not done yet if you need to go i understand paragraph 70 but before a just god can pour out his judgment upon a people he has to make a way of escape for everyone who desires to receive it america america how often god would have desired to draw you under his wings come on now and shelter you and you would not you celebrate the wrong things you grieve over the wrong things you've certainly lost your way just like jerusalem of old i don't know if you saw any of the coverage uh of the 20th anniversary of 9 11 but i watched those 21 minutes and for 20 years i had not watched the entirety of those 21 minutes intentionally i left the room on more than one occasion when those 21 minutes of coverage were being played because i could not handle watching it's it's the most shattering 21 minutes of footage you'll ever watch in your life perhaps but i made up my mind on the 20th anniversary i was going to watch all 21 minutes and i made sure i was in the right place when at the right time when the plane would strike the first tower and nobody has a problem remembering where you were and what you were doing and how it affected you and how the churches were full week after week after week after week churches had record attendance after that and we said we'll never forget we'll never forget we'll never forget but i want you to know we forgot and to prove that we forgot we look what we look what happened in november we don't say anything else america has forgot how do you think those soldiers feel yesterday i saw some of them interviewed how do you think some of those soldiers fell who risked their lives to put an end to that kind of violence to make sure that it never happened in america again and then to hear the very people that they were sent to protect others from called reasonable and business-like and and cordial what a mockery see it proves what a sad condition our nation is in you don't have to say amen you're too late you're your opinion's too late to matter now because the evidence is in the verdict is here it's very very sad where we stand in this nation but i want you to know god can never pour his judgment upon a people he has to make a way of escape for everyone who desires to receive it that means there has to come a message there has to come a warning because judgment cannot fall without a warning and he has sent that one generation ago this nation was indicted for the second crucifixion of jesus christ the word and she has received wave after wave after wave of hardship ever since you can say amen or o me and i can tell you that the worst is yet to come you'd better be one of those if he should come and say get under my wings come on now get under my wings you better run with everything you have somebody ought to say man you better run with everything you have to get under those wings he said this is your day of visitation you might not want to believe it because an uneducated minister said it but don't pay no attention to the messenger pay attention to the message you're hearing now let us pray what a way to end in the sermon and then one more in in the message elisha the prophet paragraph 61 he's praying and he said our heavenly father that's the desire of every heart tonight here oh look at them lord maybe 15 25 people raise their hand they want to receive you just now oh great spirit that started out back in the early age lived in the men who lived in the hearts of your prophets and down through the age you come and vindicated yourself how we can see david climbing that mountain looking back over jerusalem rejected by his own and he wept as he went up the mount and just a few hundred years after that we see the son of david david rejected first the first rejected then here we go we see the son of david rejected sitting on that same mountain saying jerusalem jerusalem how oft would i have hovered you as a henwood or chick but you would not if you'd have only knowed the day of your visitation dear father tonight in my heart i feel the holy spirit crying out oh america america how oft would the holy spirit have given you a real outpouring of a revival how he would have gathered you and held you in safety this is 1956 this is the closing hour of the greatest revival that america has ever known [Music] and here he prays oh how often would the holy spirit give you a real outpouring of revival how he would have gathered you and held you in safety but i believe you didn't understand the day of your visitation you scorned the prophets you've called them fanatics you've put them in jail you all have off would he have took you and tonight lord to the individual that thou seldom deals with the nation but you do with individuals and tonight hands has went up and wants to embrace you lord i pray that the holy spirit will show these people that you love them embrace them into your bosom just now and when this service is over father i pray they'll go out of here the happiest people that there is in chicago granite father that's what happens when you get under his wings right in the midst of adversity right in the midst of the fire right in the midst of your hurt right in the midst of your pain when you get under his wings you can be the happiest person in lee county alabama because you know that you know that you know that you know that he's holding you is anybody here anybody here now i want a few more moments i don't know that i could ever get back here so i'm going to do this just stay with me a moment now here here's something very important the antichrist spirit is alive and well it's been in the earth since the time of our lord it's working overtime it's trying to deceive a nation even right now there's so many things going on it seems that we're hardly even allowed to speak about it even some of you resist but i want you to know something it's unfolding before your eyes whether you can see it or not there's no doubt in my mind the boycott that brother branham talked about is upon us we're in the beginnings of those seasons that he talked about where the boycott would fall and listen if a church doesn't line up you heard the same message i've heard if a church doesn't line up with what the government says then he said they'll turn that place into a warehouse don't you lay out don't you lay out a house of god don't you sit on your place of ease and miss your opportunity to be gathered together with the saints because there's coming a day i hope i'm i hope i'm out of here but there's coming a day when the boycott falls you you do know what he said don't you he talked about that mark while everybody's worried about a tattoo while everybody's worried about getting a number on their forehead their hearts have already received the mark of the beast their intellect has already been shifted by the spirit of the antichrist so that they believe everything they're told except the truth that's what the antichrist spirit does if you don't believe that it was so powerful in the garden that it caused eve to believe something that she was told over and above what god had already told her that spirit is so cunning that trail of the serpent is so cunning and it twists like leviathan and it's working overtime across our nation and across our world and there are people who who say well i don't know what day that'll be that one of these days there they'll come and put a number on us and a tattoo on us and so forth etc how many of you know the prophet of god taught us something a whole lot different than just getting some number or some mark on your hand he said why it's the forehead he said well that's the intellect and that means that whatever that spirit tells you people believe it and they line up look and they listen folks they didn't like it when isaiah said it they didn't like it when ezekiel said it they didn't like it when jeremiah said it they didn't like it when jesus said it they're not going to like it when you say it and they don't like it when i say it either but they're going to line up like dummies like people who have no ability to speak or to think or reason for themselves and they're going to follow blindly whatever they're told not because they have a tattoo but because they've already received a false system which is more religious than political but in the end they come so close together you can hardly tell them apart you see while even around the message there are so many who are just sure that kamala harris is a woman in purple i'm still tending to believe just like he said it could be the catholic church more than just a vice president more than just a wicked woman but a system that's so slick and so sly that the people just line up that's mainstream why that's mainstream christianity that's orthodox christianity i'm telling you you know and did you hear what the pope said no i didn't hear and i'm not really interested in what he had to say and i don't know if this is the one or the next one's the one or the next one's one i don't know when he's coming but he's coming and one day one's coming out of america and when it does you better know that you know you're nearly gone because those things are unfolding before us and then you can't somehow invest your faith when a sermon comes that says you better know your season and people will sit back sometime and look like i don't know i just don't even know what he's talking about when in reality you really do you really do because you've heard it already if you've heard the message you really do we're coming into that very very serious hour very very serious hour daniel 7 25 i got to hurry daniel 7 25 if you need to slip out we understand and he shall speak great words against the most high and shall wear out the saints of the most high and think to change times and laws and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time this is the spirit of the antichrist and what does he want to do he wants to change times and laws he wants to get things all confused in the people's minds why because he's the great counterfeit and what is he the counterfeit to daniel 2 20 look at it daniel answered and said blessed be the name of god forever and ever for wisdom and might are his and he changeth the times and he changeth the times and the seasons he removeth kings and setteth up kings oh my you reckon it's true he giveth wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to them that no understanding he revealeth the deep and secret things he knoweth what is in the darkness and the light dwelleth with him so no wonder the antichrist you're still able to listen so no wonder the antichrist comes along and says i'll just mess with times and say i'll just take i'll just take some authority over that and get things all twisted up the enemy doesn't want you to know where we are in god's timeline the enemy doesn't want you to know where we are in god's economy but you can know do you have the holy ghost do you have the holy ghost if you have the holy ghost you can know where you are now i want to take 10 minutes and i'll do the rest of this on tuesday night i i guess maybe it's a more of a tuesday night message anyway but i was just building to get to something one of the ways that god can speak to us prophetically is by the calendar how do i know that because the bible said that he sets those lights there in the heavens to determine times and years so god can use the calendar he can use the hebrew calendar even though it's been greatly adjusted through the years he can use the gregorian calendar even though it's also been adjusted some through the years because it's more than a number to god he can speak in so many different ways but again one of the ways that he speaks is numbers have you ever had god speak to you in numbers let me see your hand if you've ever heard god's voice in a number i have and i like it i'm just not real good at it i have a tendency to miss it and somebody has to come back and point it out to me so pray for me i'd like to be a lot more sensitive and and catch that but we entered in when we left the 5760s on the hebrew calendar and we came into the to the 56 70s excuse me 57 80s when we left the 57 70s and came into the 57 80s in 2020 we came into 5780 we are now in 5782 we changed not only a year but we actually changed decades and you know this there was a little bit mentioned we didn't talk a lot about it because it just seems like we have so many people that aren't really interested in this and that's okay it's all right but just remember that you may not be but somebody else may you know it may mean something it does in fact mean something to some people and so we left the decade of the i in a y i n which was the decade of the i and it was about seeing and isn't it interesting that when we came out of the decade of the eye we entered into the decade of the pay which is the mouth and it isn't an interesting that the year on the gregorian calendar that changed it all was 2020 and the first thing you think about when you think about 2020 is not the mouth you think about the eye and you think about 20 20 vision i didn't take a lot of time but i was in the hospital with my mom every day when she had had that last stroke and i spent some time studying while she was sleeping and i came and just brought a little bit i didn't bring a whole lot but i just brought a little bit as much as most of you could stand just a little bit about it and i won't have time to go back through or try to lay it all out but remember that we were seeing in fact we even had a brother that was standing here who prophesied to us during that time that 2020 would be a year of perfect vision well the problem is 2020 doesn't even mean perfect vision do you remember us talking about that that doesn't mean perfect vision that is the measurement of the clarity and uh being able to to make out with clarity what you see from a distance of 20 feet so one of the 20s in 2020 is 20 feet that's not perfect vision it means something a little different than that it actually means the clarity or sharpness of vision measured at a distance of 20 feet it's actually visual acuity which is literally the sharpness of your vision so the whole theme prophetically for for a lot of folks around who hear things and pick up things in the spirit was about seeing but we were leaving the decade of seeing and we were about to enter a very interesting decade we were going to enter the decade of the mouth isn't that interesting would you just show the pay again just the i'm not sure if that's i think it's probably uh picture one i've only got four pictures i think it may be picture one and just get the letter there just to see the hebrew number i think most of you know that in hebrew every letter has a number and they don't write numerals like we do they write from their alphabet and each of the letters in the hebrew alphabet uh have a numeric value and this has been followed for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years it's very very interesting throughout the old testament you can see a lot of interesting things and maybe we'll look at them another time but i would like to at least show you what the pay looks like it looks like a face uh and there's a great reason for that because in hebrew your face represents you i'm gonna just wait a moment and take a sip of water and and see if we can get that one up hawkish working at it too that was more like a guzzle wasn't it do we at least see them are they there okay i want you to see it while i say it say it again soy why did you drain the battery of that mouse i thought these things only happened to me when i'm oh praise the lord you want to stand up and do jumping jacks yeah you sure can i'm nearly done but i'm not counting this on my 10 minutes the battery's not my fault not their fault either pay you see how it's shaped it's shaped like a face you see that it has a mouth of course there's a whole lot we can say about that image right there but we'll just leave it like that you remember because we showed you the i.e and for 10 years for a decade because of the 80 57 80 57 81 57 82 and it goes on that means the whole decade is a decade where the letter for the decade is a pay which is the number 80 in value last year it was the pay and the olive which is the is the father it's the beginning it's the first of the letters and there's a whole lot that we can say about that but we won't take the time right now to do it that's good now i can see that that looks really good but i wanted you to get the image of a face and a mouth and i wanted you to know that this was changing uh in 5780 as we were ending 2019 coming into 2020 and does anybody know what all was going on in the earth did you know that there's a research project going on right now to investigate a case of covid in alabama in december of 2019. there's a whole group of scientists that are studying and they know that there was at least one case in alabama in december of 2019 and it was diagnosed as an unknown virus but now they're taking their their they have the ability to take the makeup of that virus and compare it and they're believing that it was here in a general form in december of 2019 we we move into 2020 as we start approaching then uh several months into 5780 and it's supposed to be about the mouth it's supposed to be about decreeing it's supposed to be about your words it's supposed to be about your face because in hebrew your face is your identity and if you cover up your face you lose who you are interesting interesting you lose your face your face is covered you lose who you are big mistakes can be made when somebody covers their face would you say it's so you can get the wrong woman you can wake up with the wrong wife with a covered face a lot of things can happen and so i find it very interesting that the pay is a picture of the face in hebrew your face represents you it represents your identity it's the picture of a mouth it means word speech expression and vocalization it reminds us that your words matter which when we brought this in 2020 that's exactly what we said i in the decade of the eye gives insight but it's the pay the mouth that gives expression to insight so we not only have to see clearly we have to believe god to give us the grace to speak clearly the enemy doesn't want you to see what season you're in and he doesn't want you to be able to say anything about it right so he wants to blind you and he also wants to make you dumb no doubt about it there's no doubt in my mind that it's very prophetic that almost the entire population of the world has spent these last two years with their faces including their mouths covered by a mask wouldn't have meant the same in the decade of the eye we didn't cover our eyes it means something a little bit different when you're entering into a season where the emphasis is the mouth and now the mouth is covered and a people lose their identity they do they do they do i'm not criticizing a mass you should wear a mask when you feel like you need to i'm not in any way saying if you use the mask you're wrong what i'm saying is it symbolizes something prophetically the enemy is after your voice he doesn't want you speaking do you know why because he knows that within you is the power to speak your own deliverance because the holy ghost is there you might be waiting on someone else to deliver you you might be waiting on a preacher to pray for you but the truth is you have the power of the holy ghost within you and your deliverance is in your own mouth so wear a mask in public if that's what you feel like you should do but spiritually rip it off spiritually serve notice on the enemy i will not be silent i will speak the truth and i will speak my way out my the prophet taught us about the power and the significance of the spoken word we're nearly done but i'm getting it out there i'm going to be obedient i'm getting it out there what you do is up to you this represents our identity being concealed and our speech being muffled words are very powerful they affect both the hearer and the speaker did you know you were affected by the words you speak your whole body responds to the sound of your voice so the cancer doesn't belong to you the migraines don't belong to you the allergies are not yours come on this pain in my back is not mine it's trespassing it doesn't belong there so it's not my back pain it's not my cancer come on it's not my allergies it's not my sore toe it doesn't belong to me i am whole how are you whole because the word of god says i am whole with his stripes he healed me he sent his word and did what he healed me everything else is a lying vanity somebody said you're saying it's not real i think my pain oh no i believe it's real but it shouldn't be there and you have the about the power and the ability by faith to speak to that look folk you can't slip from the simple gospel of believing that you're made whole by the blood of the lamb you you cannot allow the enemy to talk you in to to everything and and own it as though you you've got to be broken down to because you're old well that means that i've got socks that are built better than i am because that means i've got pieces of furniture and things that man made that have lasted longer and held up longer and better than i have and i've got the best creator in all of eternity oh he made me so well i'm fearfully and wonderfully made by a loving god and i don't have to accept i do not have to accept it i see that some people won't accept it go ahead go ahead yours you can own it if you like but you've got a choice will you believe the word whose report will you believe so don't let the devil silence you let's look for we're we're not episcopalian we're not silent prayers we don't have to pray like some you know dead dry form of religion afraid that if we speak up in prayer you know we're going to be fanatic you you ought to pray if you have to the top of your lungs you ought to go through your home with your hands in the air like i have to do some time confessing with everything that you've got lord i take you at your word hallelujah like i said a moment ago i don't know but god you know no i'm not going to be quiet no i'm not going to be quiet you can't even hear uh when they take your order you have to listen so carefully in the natural to hear what they're saying i'm embarrassed because they see my gray beard and i know they think it's because i have a great beard that i can't hear but it's not it's because i can't hear through that nothing wrong with that if that's what i'm telling you i'm not against that in the natural but i'm against it in the spiritual somebody said they won't let me say anything in church you don't have to talk here to be able to talk but we've been offering every tuesday night testify to us of the goodness of god tell us what the lord has done come on and one by one we've gone through now all those that are going to probably and we're starting back on those that already have that's okay because some are determined ain't no rock gonna cry out in my place and some are determined where i am right now is not where i've always been and i may feel like i can't get a prayer above the ceiling now but there was a time that i prayed and it shook the heavens and god heard me and if i have to go all the way back to that like brother greeley has mentioned what the prophet said you can't say anything else you can tell them how your candle got lit if god hasn't done anything else for you since he saved you go all the way back and remember how he found you where you were and showed you grace and mercy and love and goodness and salvation and compassion anybody with me hallelujah your words are very powerful they're very powerful i'm going to skip that now there's so many interesting things that we can talk about maybe tuesday night but i have found that god can speak to us and as i said a moment ago the hebrew calendar he can speak to us in the gregorian calendar in 2008 bob jones said to me personally i'd heard him say to others or mention it before in speaking but he said to me personally in 2008 he mentioned that he believed that there was a psalm that spoke prophetically for every year and i would just like to present that psalm to you that's not what i wanted to bring but i don't have time to talk about where we are in the 5782 but i will because two letters are coming together an 80 a pay and a bet and it forms a very interesting message because the bet is the house and the pay is the mouth and as soon as i read it as soon as i read that the pay was the mouth and the bait was the house i heard this phrase what house will you build me it's a time and a season where god wants to talk to us he doesn't want to be muffled he doesn't want us to hear in a muffled manner he wants to be able to speak to us clearly and he wants to speak to us in the house because he's looking for a house he's looking for a place to dwell in and how many of you know that's not a building with four walls because that same word bet can also be used for tent or tabernacle or temporary dwelling place doesn't have to be a house so it's you it's you you're the tabernacle you're where he wants to reside and something beautiful many beautiful things start coming out because when you look at the letter pay there's a hidden bet there already if you'll just put that pay up again let's show them that you see where the where it's white in the center that is actually the letter bet it's there it's hidden in the pay it's the only year in the decade of 10 years that the actual number of the year is reflected in the letter itself the pay both both attributes both meanings are expressed by looking at just one of the letters they both show up and there's a lot of interesting things that we can talk about and will i shared some of them with the class on wednesday but i want to just leave you with this because our time is done i want to leave you with the psalm for the year in 2020 the hebrew year 5780 the psalm was 120 read it read psalm 120 and see if that doesn't sound a little bit like your 2020. it's very very very i wanted to say uncanny but it's very very prophetic in 2021 hebrew year 57 81 the psalm was 121. and now as we have entered into 5782 leaving 2021 going into 2022 the psalm is psalm 122 and we're going to read it in closing would you stand musicians are coming we're going to read nine verses if you take the time to go back and look at psalm 120 if you take the time to go back it look at psalm 121 you're going to see things in those psalms that remind you of the year you had now i can go all the way back to 2008 because the day that bob jones mentioned that to me i opened up my bible and i wrote down over that psalm i wrote the year 2008 and i can go all the way back to 2008 and read those psalms and i can find amazing messages or symbols in those psalms that spoke to me about the year that i was going to have and i can not only do it as an individual i can do it as a church body i can see things that happen to us and with us and in us that correlate with that psalm and i can also see it as a nation i can see that some of the verses in that psalm reflect what was going on in the nation at that time now they say hindsight is is 20 20. so looking back it's easier to see what was being spoken of than it is when we're looking forward but right now we're going to look forward and i want us to read it together and you should have it there psalm 122 all nine verses i was glad i was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the lord this is not a year to forsake the assembling of yourselves together as the manner of some is this is the year to get together with god's people i was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the lord our feet shall stand within thy gates jerusalem i'm going to jerusalem this year claiming it somebody said i just don't think you can do your life you do yourself what do you want to jerusalem is build it as a city that is compact together whether the tribes go up the tribes of the lord under the testimony of israel to give thanks unto the name of the lord for there are set thrones of judgment you better hear this the thrones of the house of david what is the hebrew letter for 5782 the pay and the bet and that is the house it represents the house the thrones of the house of david i read verse six and it tells me i need to be faithful in my prayers for jerusalem and for israel this year i need to be more faithful than i've ever been because something is on the horizon are you saying all that because of a yes that's how the scripture is supposed to work in our lives so yes for me i'm making a dedication i've already done it this week i'm making a dedication pray for the peace of jerusalem they shall prosper that love thee peace be within thy walls and prosperity within my palaces and i might also mention that the last message that the rabbi brought to us in this church was from that verse for my brethren and companion's sake i will now say peace be within thee lord we prophesy peace to the city of jerusalem to the nation of israel because of the house there it is again because of the house of the lord our god i will seek thy good now i believe that there are messages for us in the scripture and i believe after following these psalms i've at least usually read them to you in the year after following them since 2008 i believe i can say that god has used the psalm of the year to speak to my life personally i've seen him address things in our church and i've seen him address things in our nation so i just encourage you if you have nothing else to go to war with in prayer you take psalm 122 with you and you say lord speak to me speak to me from this psalm show me direct my thoughts direct my prayers direct my footsteps because there's certainly something that you're wanting to say to me and i want to leave you with this verse psalm 66 verse 1 in the amplified thus saith jehovah the heavens are my throne and the earth is my footstool what is the house that ye will build unto me and what is the place of my rest so lord right now we ask that you will cause us to be a people that you can come to that you can take up your temple ian our body is the temple of the holy ghost everything we read in the scripture is about you desiring a bride just play something softly you desiring a bride that you can live in a people that you can tabernacle in take up your remodein and lord i'm struck by this phrase that you might take your rest in us now you you can't find rest where there's turmoil you can't find rest where there's anxiety and fear so i'm asking you lord for the new hope revival ministries as a watchman i'm asking you that that you help us as we change seasons with you to become a people so prepared by the holy spirit that you can find your rest in us let peace be upon each life there's so much anger so much turmoil so much anxiety even in church folks today aggression pent-up emotion no wonder you can't fully rest in us but lord we recognize our condition today and we say help us help us help us lord to build a house and a place for you to come and dwell and take your rest and take your rightful position in us and speak to us is anybody with me in this prayer speak to us and through us we commit i wonder if there's any of you that would want to just come and stand here or perhaps kneel but you just want to come and stand for just a moment and say lord i want to build you that house this year i want to build you this that kind of a house that you can come and take your rest in i i know we've certainly had a struggle this morning but i feel something moving in my inner man is something waking up and i appreciate you feeling like you could come and join me in a prayer right now you pray you pray i'll continue to pray but i want you to pray lord help me help me to build a house help me to provide an environment that you can come in and take up your rest speak to us and through us oh god every demon power of hell that wants to shut the bride up every demon power of hell that wants to steal our voice and clip our tongue every demon power of hell that wants to intimidate your bride in this hour from being the prophetic people that she has been called to be we resist that with all the faith that you have given us we resist that in the name of the lord jesus christ we resist that and we say there's a people here there's a people among us it's certainly not all of us but there's a people among us who desire with everything they have to be led this year to be led by a gentle voice to be led by a nudge to be led by whipping if that's what it takes so that we can obey you in all things oh if you could just rest in us if we could just deal with the anxiety if we could just deal with the fear if we could just deal with the anger if we could deal with the resentment if we could deal with a jealousy oh god if we could deal with all those things that
