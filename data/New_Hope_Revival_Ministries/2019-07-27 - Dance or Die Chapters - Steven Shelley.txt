TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] in the early 1990s I was invited to preach at a youth convocation in Metro Manila in the Philippines thousands of young people Pentecostal young people had come together for a very special time of seeking the Lord and I was there to minister in several churches throughout the islands but as a part of the itinerary I was invited to go and even though I'm a non-denominational preacher I was invited by this Pentecostal group to come and my what a wonderful time we had it was in that service that I heard a song for the first time that I've enjoyed singing many many times since then as those young people lifted their hands and tilted their heads back and entered into the presence of the Lord they began to sing a little chorus and the words are like this when the Spirit of the Lord falls upon my heart I will dance like David danced and danced we did in the presence of the Lord and I also remember when that service was over the floor was slanted toward the stage and I watched as those precious young people wept to their way to a closer walk with God and I saw the tears as they come flowing down that floor mingling together and by the time they got to the bottom of the stage they had formed what looked like a stream of Tears it moved me and I've never forgotten it inspired me in a tremendous way I want to share with you the verses of Scripture where that phrase is taken from when David truly danced before the Lord in 2nd Samuel chapter 6 verses 13 through 16 it says and it was so that when they that bear the Ark of the Lord had gone six phases he sacrificed oxen and fat and David danced before the Lord with all his might and David was girded with a linen ephod so David and all the house of Israel brought up the Ark of the Lord with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet and as the Ark of the Lord came into the City of David Michael or Mahale Saul's daughter looked through a window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the Lord and she despised him in her heart I think most of you are familiar with the story and you know of the fatal decision that David had made earlier to bring the Ark of the Covenant the Ark of the Lord into the City of David the city of Jerusalem and he thought well we ought to give it a more up-to-date mode of transportation than men being carried as it has been carried all of these years but David was forgetting that God had a provided order and he had a provided protocol and so they built a new cart and as they were bringing the ark forward on that new cart pulled by oxen it began to shake and there was a man by the name of OSA who stretched forth his hand to steady the ark and was slain in the presence of God David felt very responsible for what had taken place and the Ark of the Lord eventually made it to the house of obed-edom and I believe that David according to this verses of Scripture that in this chapter and one other place I believe that David was waiting it out he wanted to make sure that the the anger of the Lord was no longer kindled against him and that everything was in order to move forward he began to hear that the blessings of God were falling on the house of obed-edom because of the presence of the Lord that was with the Ark and he said I think now is the right time and so he arranged a great procession to bring the Ark of the Lord the house of obed-edom in a city Kiryat i-i'm just outside the city of jerusalem about a 14 15 mile journey david went all the way over there and he said we're going to stop every six phases and sacrifice both oxen and fat legs to the Lord I think this was over and above what was necessary but David was doing it because he wanted to get it right this time he learned from his mistake the Bible said that as they began to move forward that David went before the ark dancing with all of his might that word dancing that used here is from the Hebrew and it it's a particular word that means to spin around around and around like the turning of of a mill wheel the wheel of a mill and so it wasn't just a little kicking up of the of the feet it was a glorious dance it was an amazing dance around and around and around the Ark of the Covenant he went the Bible tells us here how David was dressed I think there's a real reason for that it tells us that he was dressed in a linen ephod that was the simple work garment of the priest those who were servants of Jehovah ministering before the Lord in the tabernacle and eventually in the temple it was alright for David to wear that ephod but it was most unusual for him to wear it in a public procession and in order to be seen in his linen ephod he would have had to remove his regal and festal robes those beautiful garments that differentiated and set him apart as the king of Israel it also means that he would have had to remove his heavy crown and so he didn't look like the king of Israel that day as he danced before the Lord he looked like a common servant or a common priest he was so moved and so inspired that the blessing of the Lord would now be upon the City of David the City of Jerusalem he was so delighted because this Ark of the Covenant represented the word of the Lord it was the earthly representation of the throne of God and David was so moved so excited that it was coming back to Jerusalem and that meant the blessing and the presence of God was coming back to Jerusalem that he just got beside himself he forgot about royal protocol he forgot about any pride that he might have previously had or ego and he laid all of that other stuff down and he worshiped the Lord in in a grand fashion I love that it's inspiring to me because when we come into the house of the Lord every week we also are weighted down with our troubles and our worries and our cares and if perchance we have dealt with all of that before we come sometimes we still have our pride we have our ego we have our reputation to maintain and so we want to make sure that we don't get too excited in the house of the Lord but I want you to know that if there's ever been a time to come into God's presence and worship Him with all of our might with all of our strength with all of our heart this is the hour to do that it creates an atmosphere for the Word of God to come with both power and demonstration the Bible tells us that hell the daughter of Saul had been given to David as a wife in fact taken from another man and given to David as a wife I don't think she was very happy to be where she was but the Bible said she was looking out the window and she saw David dancing most violently before the Lord and she despised him in her heart and accused him later of dancing before the women uncovering himself before the women she didn't think that this kind of display of emotion was fitting for someone of such stature and such importance but I want you to know David did not want to be viewed that day as the king of Israel he wanted to be seen as a servant of the Lord and he wanted all the focus all the adoration to go to the King of Kings and the Lord of lords when we get in a tough spot we need to praise the Lord there's only two times to praise him when we feel like it and when we don't feel like it if we will press in with a sacrifice of praise if we will lay aside all the other stuff that weighs on our mind that keeps us from enjoying the Liberty that we can have in the presence of the Lord if we'll put all that down and begin to give God everything we have clapping our hands raising our hands lifting our voices shouting before the Lord and yes even dancing the psalm tells us dance before the lord I know there's a proper time there's a proper place there's a proper order but I also know this Satan would like to steal your praise he will send somebody to criticize you he did David but David had an answer for her he certainly did in 2nd Samuel 6 21 and 22 he said I wasn't dancing before you and in one of the other translations of those verses it said I'm gonna become even more undignified than this I'll be humiliated in my own eyes but the slave girls that you spoke of I will be held in honor and that's exactly what what what would have happened David said I'm just gonna be vile or the next time I'm not going to let criticism stop me somebody is going to despise your praise somebody's going to misunderstand your dance somebody is gonna look at you like you're way too loud and you need to hold hold back you need to watch yourself a little bit but I want you to know there's a time to be quiet to be reserved to honor and cherish the sacred moment but there is also a time that we need to turn loose of some things lay aside some things and maybe your dance will not be a physical dance but maybe it will just be a determination that says I'm going to praise the Lord because he is worthy no matter what I'm going through dancing will cost you praise will cost you as I said it will be misunderstood I want to read a quick quote in closing it comes from the daughter of Billy Graham her name is Anne Graham Lotz many of you are familiar with her and you know that she is in a battle with cancer here is something she said a Christian will dance or Die you have no other choice dance before the king of kings or sit on the pew and be critical and die you can't even watch others dance and get by you've got to do it or die I believe those are appropriate words I believe sometime the only way out is to praise your way out and I want to encourage you you don't have to wait till you get to church maybe you're in a environment a church environment that doesn't allow much demonstration of praise get in your living room get out in the barn get out behind the house go out in the woods go wherever you can go and sing your praise dance before the Lord with all of your strength and with all of your mind because he alone is worthy and tell the enemy you'll not steal my praise you'll not quench my dance I'm going to make sure that the glory and the honor belongs to the Lord and that he receives it no matter what I'm going through god bless you it's dance or die
