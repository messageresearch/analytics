[3:11] blessing because it's a blessing to me
[3:14] to be able to speak to you week to week
[3:17] about the good news and the gospel and
[3:20] the end time message of the lord jesus
[3:22] christ we're studying the birth pains
[3:25] we're talking about jesus's discourse
[3:28] the discourse that our messiah gave on
[3:31] the mount of olives in matthew chapter
[3:33] 24. it's also found the same sermon with
[3:37] a slight variation is also found in the
[3:39] book of luke and there are some other
[3:41] places where
[3:43] particular parts of this sermon are
[3:46] given in the gospels
[3:48] we were speaking last week particularly
[3:51] about matthew chapter 24 and verse 8
[3:55] where it says all these are the
[3:58] beginning of sorrows it begins to talk
[4:00] about wars and rumors of wars
[4:04] uh see that you be not troubled for for
[4:06] the end is not yet and then it says in
[4:09] verse seven nation shall rise against
[4:12] nation kingdom against kingdom and there
[4:14] shall be famines and pestilences and
[4:17] earthquakes in diverse places but verse
[4:21] 8 then follows by saying all these are
[4:24] the beginning of sorrows that's king
[4:26] james
[4:28] i read last week from some of the other
[4:31] translations like the new american
[4:33] standard that says but all these things
[4:36] are merely the beginning of the birth
[4:38] pains i think it's clear that we are now
[4:42] transitioning out of the beginning of
[4:44] sorrows the beginning of birth pains and
[4:47] we are seeing uh the the birthing
[4:51] process the labor process the
[4:53] contractions we can see them
[4:55] intensifying this is an analogy that's
[4:58] used in this verse of scripture
[5:00] comparing the unfolding events of the
[5:03] end time
[5:04] just prior to the second coming of the
[5:06] lord jesus christ
[5:08] with a woman who is in travail and in
[5:11] labor
[5:12] and we know
[5:14] that when labor begins it begins small
[5:18] the pains are are
[5:21] bearable and there is quite a gap in
[5:25] between those pains the body is
[5:27] beginning to transition into the labor
[5:31] process and the body is beginning to
[5:33] squeeze so that that little baby can be
[5:36] delivered from the inside of his mommy's
[5:40] warm uh belly to this big old world
[5:43] that's anxiously awaiting his or her
[5:46] arrival
[5:47] and as labor continues to transition and
[5:51] progress in fact i believe that's one of
[5:53] the terms in labor that's used medically
[5:56] is transition labor it's just moving
[6:00] into that place where the contractions
[6:02] are getting more serious not yet a time
[6:05] for the mommy to start helping push this
[6:08] little baby into into um
[6:12] out into this big world
[6:14] but but things are beginning to
[6:16] intensify i believe we can see intensity
[6:18] i believe the labor pains are going to
[6:20] continue to get more serious we're going
[6:23] to see the earthquakes growing in
[6:26] intensity and in frequency we're going
[6:29] to see the storms even the super storms
[6:32] that have been prophesied and talked
[6:34] about and even predicted scientifically
[6:37] we're going to see more signs in the
[6:40] heavens as the scripture talks about
[6:42] we're going to see those signs becoming
[6:44] more frequent and more intense what you
[6:46] can basically do is take all of the
[6:49] signs that are mentioned in the
[6:51] scripture as being a part of the
[6:52] beginning of the labor pains and you can
[6:55] you can
[6:57] know for sure that all of those things
[6:59] will continue to happen right up until
[7:01] the time of the second coming all the
[7:03] way through the period of the rapture
[7:05] resurrection of the bride and right into
[7:07] the last three and a half years of
[7:09] tribulation that we refer to as the
[7:11] great wrath
[7:13] they're going to continue to be more
[7:15] intense and more frequent
[7:17] jesus talks about these things as i
[7:19] mentioned a moment ago in several places
[7:22] one is matthew 24 one is luke chapter
[7:25] 21. you can look at that and even mark
[7:28] talks about some of the very same things
[7:31] in mark chapter 13 and verse 37 our lord
[7:35] said what i say to one i say to all
[7:39] watch
[7:40] and i think that's good advice we need
[7:42] to watch and pray we need to be a people
[7:45] who are able to discern the signs of the
[7:48] end time and we need to kind of be able
[7:50] to to prophetically gauge where we are
[7:53] in this process um
[7:55] i think we're approaching the end of the
[7:57] end of all things i really believe that
[8:00] we're going to see uh the earth what
[8:03] what this is about is the earth itself
[8:06] is in labor there's something that is to
[8:09] be born there's something that is to
[8:11] come forth
[8:12] i believe part of that which is to come
[8:15] forth is the adoption of sons the
[8:18] manifestation of the bride of jesus
[8:21] christ
[8:22] and again as we've mentioned in earlier
[8:24] broadcasts this move of the spirit that
[8:27] we have referred to as the bride's
[8:29] revival is going to cause separation
[8:32] because it's going to bring you into a
[8:35] place where you're no longer satisfied
[8:37] with church as usual you're no longer
[8:40] satisfied with a with a warmed over
[8:42] message or with the entertainment that
[8:45] the church seems to be so good at these
[8:47] days your heart is crying for more uh
[8:51] you know that worship i think you're
[8:53] beginning to know as god pulled you the
[8:55] deep calling to the deep that worship is
[8:57] not about entertaining the listeners or
[9:00] the worshipers the so-called worshipers
[9:02] worship is about engaging it's about
[9:05] setting your mind and your focus on the
[9:08] lord jesus christ and just loving him
[9:11] and adoring him it's not about a rock
[9:13] concert it's not about being stimulated
[9:16] musically it's about an atmosphere being
[9:19] created
[9:20] so that we can have communion with him
[9:23] and so that we can begin to prepare our
[9:25] hearts to hear the revelation of his
[9:27] word
[9:28] uh i think that we can look at the birth
[9:31] pains that are mentioned in the
[9:34] scripture and we can sort of classify
[9:36] them into 10 different categories and i
[9:39] want to begin to talk about those 10
[9:41] categories with you today and i want us
[9:44] to
[9:45] to count down i want us to count from
[9:47] the number 10 all the way down to the
[9:50] number one
[9:51] and we're going to be counting in
[9:52] significance relative to current issues
[9:55] and events which means we're going to
[9:57] start with number 10
[10:00] and these are
[10:01] the 10 main categories of the birth
[10:04] pains that are happening in the world
[10:06] today and again that will increase
[10:10] in intensity and the period of time
[10:13] between these birth pains that that's
[10:15] going to get shorter and shorter so the
[10:17] frequency
[10:18] uh is going to change and we're going to
[10:21] start seeing these things happening at
[10:23] such a rapid fire secession one right
[10:26] after another and uh people are going to
[10:29] begin to to realize that the earth is
[10:32] going through a transition a
[10:34] transformation because something is is
[10:36] coming the kingdom of god is coming
[10:39] and the earth is in birth pains the
[10:42] earth is a part of god's creation and
[10:44] the world that we live in right now is
[10:46] going through labor it it really is and
[10:49] that is the explanation for the for the
[10:52] shifting of the plates beneath the
[10:54] earth's surface that is the explanation
[10:57] for super storms and tsunamis and a lot
[11:01] of the things that are happening in the
[11:02] world it's the earth itself going
[11:05] through transition going through labor
[11:08] pains to get ready to to bring forth the
[11:11] kingdom of god of which you and i have
[11:14] been called to be a part of so i'm going
[11:16] to start with number 10 and count down
[11:18] number 10
[11:20] jesus said there will be signs in the
[11:23] sun and the moon and the stars even in
[11:26] the heavens luke chapter 21 and verse 25
[11:30] says just that and this is yeshua the
[11:34] lord jesus speaking and there shall be
[11:36] signs in the sun and in the moon and in
[11:40] the stars and upon the earth distress of
[11:43] nations with perplexity the sea and the
[11:47] waves roaring so not only the earth the
[11:51] earth
[11:52] shaking
[11:53] the heavens also declaring that
[11:56] something is going on signs in the sun
[12:00] and the moon and in the stars and we're
[12:03] having a lot of breakthroughs in science
[12:08] in this hour where we're able to
[12:10] understand some of the things that have
[12:11] happened
[12:12] and the predictions of things that are
[12:15] coming
[12:16] this whole idea
[12:18] or realities not just an idea or a
[12:20] theory it's a reality these solar flares
[12:23] that are going on
[12:25] way above the earth's atmosphere but
[12:28] they have the potential
[12:30] of doing extreme damage on planet earth
[12:34] especially in the area of technology and
[12:37] communications so we not only have uh to
[12:41] to look ahead to things going on in the
[12:43] heavens in the sun and the moon and the
[12:45] stars but we also have to in some way
[12:47] prepare ourselves for the effect that
[12:50] these signs in the heavenlies will have
[12:53] on planet earth and i am i am sorry to
[12:56] admit that we have all become extremely
[13:00] dependent on technology uh cellular
[13:03] technology digital transfer of of
[13:06] information and files and the internet
[13:08] and wi-fi and uh all of the ways you
[13:12] know we we have our phones and our other
[13:15] devices and uh and and i'm i'm honest i
[13:18] depend on a lot of those things
[13:21] and but there may come a time as the
[13:23] heavens begin to show forth these signs
[13:26] and wonders and solar flares and more
[13:29] asteroids and more comets and
[13:32] all of these things that are happening
[13:34] even as we have just had this tragedy uh
[13:36] not too long ago in russia
[13:39] uh where where uh so many people were
[13:42] injured and some even lost their lives
[13:45] and uh uh
[13:47] there is
[13:48] certainly the potential for more
[13:52] of these kinds of things to happen as we
[13:54] approach
[13:56] uh the coming of the lord and we need to
[13:58] be aware of that we need to keep pen and
[14:01] paper around uh we may go back to stamps
[14:04] we may there may be periods of time
[14:06] where we do not have access to uh email
[14:10] and and uh internet and it would it
[14:13] would be devastating for some of us and
[14:16] but
[14:17] you know god is going to get the
[14:19] attention of this world he is going to
[14:21] get our attention
[14:23] he is coming as a thief in the night
[14:25] there's no doubt about that but the
[14:27] scripture tells us that
[14:29] this earth is not going to be able to
[14:32] say we didn't have any warning at all
[14:35] no because any time that the refining
[14:39] fires of the lord
[14:42] the evaluation of the lord comes to the
[14:44] earth where god looks down and begins to
[14:47] evaluate things for the purpose of
[14:49] judgment and justice when he does that
[14:52] he always sends a message of warning and
[14:55] so
[14:56] here is the way it is in this hour it's
[14:58] like two sides of the same coin uh it's
[15:02] like as so many people have said now
[15:04] it's like charles dickens wrote in a
[15:06] tale of two cities it was the best of
[15:08] times it was the worst of times or vice
[15:10] versa that's really where we are
[15:13] we're going to see some awful things
[15:16] happening in the world but on the other
[15:18] hand the bride of christ is going to
[15:21] raise up and function in the power and
[15:23] in the authority of god and as we
[15:26] mentioned last week in the very power of
[15:29] the creative spoken word i believe that
[15:31] there's going to be a quick short move
[15:34] of god
[15:35] that's going to show the glory of god in
[15:38] even unprecedented ways in the end time
[15:41] i don't think it's going to be a long
[15:43] drawn-out process i think it's going to
[15:45] be quick and it's going to be short but
[15:47] i think a part of that is going to be
[15:49] unbelievable amounts of
[15:53] just raw
[15:55] power of god on display
[15:58] i was told years ago prophetically that
[16:01] one of the hallmarks of the great move
[16:03] of god in the bride's revival was going
[16:06] to be the unprecedented numbers of
[16:08] people resurrected from the dead and you
[16:11] say oh you know that that's far out
[16:14] there well it wasn't far out there in
[16:15] the ministry of the lord jesus christ
[16:18] and he said uh
[16:20] when they asked the question you know
[16:22] what what must we do that we might work
[16:25] the works of of our god or of our father
[16:28] we might work the works of god he began
[16:30] to explain to them uh i'm gonna go away
[16:33] but i'm gonna send you something i'm
[16:35] going to send you another comforter and
[16:37] in another place he said i'm going to
[16:38] come to you he came with his spirit and
[16:41] his power so that you and i would be
[16:43] able to to do even more the greater
[16:46] works of god that that that you have
[16:49] seen me do you're going to do even
[16:51] greater than that that was his promise
[16:54] and so i think we're going to see the
[16:56] bride of christ functioning on a level
[16:58] of power and authority that's just going
[17:00] to shock the devil's socks off however
[17:03] he's going to continue
[17:05] to to to do the things that he has power
[17:08] and authority to do and so we need to
[17:10] stay under the blood of jesus there's no
[17:12] doubt about that and we need to be aware
[17:15] that these things are coming and in some
[17:18] way we need to be prepared to to
[17:20] minister to people because uh they're
[17:23] not going to be able to find their help
[17:25] from their own government they're not
[17:26] going to be able to find their help from
[17:28] the traditional church even in many
[17:30] cases they're going to need the bride of
[17:34] christ wherever wherever she is
[17:37] they're going to need us and so we need
[17:39] to start preparing ourselves to be the
[17:41] answer because remember i i made mention
[17:44] of a quote that that brother william
[17:46] branham shared many many years ago he
[17:48] said there's got to be an end time
[17:50] message raise up that will meet the
[17:52] conditions of the end time
[17:55] something that will take us all the way
[17:56] back to the original word something that
[17:59] will prepare us for what's coming on the
[18:01] earth both the bad and the good
[18:05] so jesus is clear number 10 one of the
[18:07] birth pains that will that we will see
[18:10] we are seeing but we will see it
[18:13] increase in frequency
[18:15] and in intensity and that is the signs
[18:18] in the sun and in the moon and the stars
[18:21] and i have all kinds of instances here
[18:23] that i could read to you but i think you
[18:25] know i mean people are even reporting uh
[18:27] the the sighting of unidentified flying
[18:30] objects you know even the intensity of
[18:32] that and i know some of that's hocus
[18:34] pocus i know some of that is is people's
[18:37] imagination but i also know that that
[18:40] some of what people are saying
[18:43] is happening both in the realm of the
[18:45] demonic and in the realm of the angelic
[18:49] and so some of the things that people
[18:51] are seeing in the sky
[18:53] is is a sign
[18:55] of the demonic principalities that are
[18:58] moving
[18:59] throughout the atmosphere of the earth
[19:01] between the earth and the second heaven
[19:04] and people are seeing some of that so
[19:06] some of it is of an evil nature i also
[19:09] believe that there are investigating
[19:11] judgment angels who who are are coming
[19:14] down watching over the earth looking at
[19:18] the circumstances of what's going on on
[19:20] this planet and sometimes they're being
[19:23] seen by the naked eye and of course
[19:26] people describe them as flying saucers
[19:29] and rings of
[19:30] light and so forth but i think a lot of
[19:33] times what people are seeing there's a
[19:34] natural a natural explanation for i also
[19:38] believe that people are seeing both
[19:40] demonic activity and angelic activity
[19:44] which we can expect to see that increase
[19:47] again in frequency and intensity
[19:51] our eyes need not be focused on these
[19:54] things our eyes need to be focused on
[19:56] the lord jesus but you can tell your
[19:58] friends and loved ones that we're going
[20:00] to see
[20:01] more
[20:02] unbelievable signs in the sun and in the
[20:06] moon and in the stars
[20:09] we're moving toward the time of great
[20:11] wrath and as we do we're going to see a
[20:15] lot of things happening number nine
[20:17] we're counting backward remember
[20:20] is violence on the earth this is going
[20:23] to increase
[20:25] in frequency and intensity
[20:28] luke chapter 17 verse 26 says and as it
[20:32] was in the days of noah so shall it be
[20:35] also in the days of the son of man and
[20:38] if you want to know how it was in the
[20:40] days of noah we go to genesis chapter 6
[20:43] verse 11 describes
[20:46] the the
[20:47] atmosphere
[20:49] uh
[20:50] of the earth of the world at the time
[20:53] genesis 6 11 said the earth also was
[20:56] corrupt before god and the earth was
[21:00] filled with violence
[21:03] we have seen unprecedented violence in
[21:05] the last few years
[21:07] um
[21:09] almost you know in well not almost
[21:11] inhumane in i mean non-human violence
[21:15] violence of such a degree of evil
[21:20] where people would be so violent toward
[21:22] one another with no regard
[21:25] for for the life of a woman or for the
[21:27] life of a child or even the light any
[21:29] life any life
[21:32] but it's hard for us to comprehend
[21:35] uh the violence that has gone on around
[21:38] the world not just the school shootings
[21:41] and the movie theater shootings and
[21:44] and and some of that that we've seen the
[21:46] the terrorism also that is so rampant
[21:50] across the world
[21:51] and and uh people not caring about the
[21:54] fact that that their innocent lives
[21:56] we're not just talking about army
[21:58] against army we're talking about
[22:00] innocent people being caught in the
[22:02] crossfire of just sheer violence
[22:06] and it is a fulfillment of the words of
[22:09] the lord jesus in luke 17 26
[22:13] and the description of genesis 6 11 the
[22:16] earth was filled with violence in the
[22:18] time of noah and in genesis verse 6
[22:21] chapter 6 verse 13 and god said to noah
[22:24] the end of all flesh is come before me
[22:26] for the earth is filled with violence
[22:29] through them and behold i will destroy
[22:32] them with the earth
[22:34] so all you've got to do is look at the
[22:35] headlines and know that violence is
[22:38] increasing around the world and it is a
[22:42] uh it is certainly a direct parallel
[22:45] with what was happening in the days of
[22:47] noah you do a little bit bit of research
[22:49] into that you will find out that there
[22:51] was unprecedented evil in uh operating
[22:55] in the time of noah uh there were demon
[22:58] spirits that were that were uh moving
[23:01] and defiling and and fallen angels and
[23:04] there was a whole scenario that we won't
[23:07] get into in this broadcast that was
[23:09] going on in genesis 6 of a of a
[23:12] unprecedented nature of just
[23:15] unparalleled evil uh regardless of how
[23:18] you interpret genesis 6 it is clear to
[23:20] see that satan was involved
[23:24] the enemy was involved and it produced
[23:26] something uh that that the world is
[23:29] still dealing with to this day and now
[23:32] we're seeing the intensity of this kind
[23:34] of evil and this kind of violence and
[23:37] i mentioned terrorism we're talking
[23:39] about not just in the middle east we're
[23:41] talking about all over the world
[23:44] we're talking about people being
[23:46] murdered we're talking about bombs that
[23:49] kill innocent people we're talking about
[23:51] people who feel like they're doing god a
[23:54] service by killing other people and we
[23:57] can expect unfortunately
[24:00] to see
[24:01] that which has been previously known
[24:04] as the beginning of sorrows we're about
[24:07] to see that trans uh
[24:10] grass or transition i guess you'd say
[24:13] into something a whole lot more
[24:16] hard to deal with and so we're going to
[24:18] need the power of god in our lives to be
[24:22] able to stand against some of those
[24:25] things that are happening in the world i
[24:28] want you to know that no matter how how
[24:30] much evil is out there how much violence
[24:33] is out there no matter what kind of
[24:35] signs are going on
[24:37] we as the elect of god the bride of
[24:40] christ will be able to stand faithful
[24:43] and true
[24:44] we need to examine our relationship with
[24:46] the lord in this hour i want to
[24:48] encourage you to do that if you're just
[24:50] a christian in name because you want
[24:52] people to know you're not a heathen or
[24:54] you're or you're not some other religion
[24:57] maybe you say i'm a christian because
[24:59] you want people to know or to
[25:01] distinguish you between a buddhist or a
[25:04] muslim or some other faith and so you
[25:06] just use the term christian
[25:09] as some sort of identification i'm
[25:11] telling you that's not enough
[25:13] we need a personal relationship with the
[25:17] lord jesus christ and it is available
[25:20] and it's easier to have than what you
[25:22] might have imagined you don't have to
[25:24] have all the religious trappings to be
[25:26] able to meet jesus you don't have to be
[25:28] in church to meet him you don't have to
[25:30] hear a preacher preach to meet him you
[25:32] can meet him right where you are right
[25:35] now all over the world whatever you're
[25:38] what wherever you are if you're on your
[25:40] job listening to this if you're in a
[25:42] public place watching this program or in
[25:44] the privacy of your home you can meet
[25:47] the lord jesus christ yeshua our messiah
[25:49] you can meet him right where you are by
[25:52] inviting him to come into your life
[25:54] perhaps you once knew the lord and you
[25:57] have given your life to him but you're
[25:59] in a state of of really sliding back
[26:02] you're in the state of of sort of going
[26:04] in the other direction i i i just
[26:07] implore you i encourage you from the
[26:09] bottom of my heart don't run away from
[26:12] the only thing that can provide safety
[26:15] and security for you in the last days
[26:17] don't run away from the only hope that
[26:19] the world has that is salvation through
[26:23] the blood of the lord jesus christ he is
[26:26] the way jesus said i am the way the
[26:29] truth and the life and you know what i
[26:31] believe him i believe he is the way and
[26:34] the truth and the life don't reject him
[26:37] now
[26:38] if you come from another religion
[26:41] you've been raised in another faith i
[26:43] encourage you to read the word of god uh
[26:47] read the four gospels matthew mark luke
[26:49] and john the first four books of the new
[26:52] testament it it describes the life and
[26:55] ministry of jesus it gives us so many of
[26:58] his sermons and words and see if the
[27:00] holy spirit will come to you and reveal
[27:03] to you that jesus is the messiah he is
[27:06] the way of salvation and he does provide
[27:10] hope for you and i in the end time i
[27:13] want to pray for you right now because i
[27:15] don't want to just
[27:16] teach you some facts i want to lead you
[27:19] to a deeper walk a deeper relationship
