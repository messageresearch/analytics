TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign longer tethered to planet earth with all of its suffering and all of its darkness we have been raised up into heavenly places to sit with christ jesus through his precious revealed word i want to greet all of you in the lovely name of the lord jesus christ my only regret is that we cannot be with you there dancing worshiping the king of kings and the lord of lords i was able to catch just a few seconds of your worship a few moments ago and my heart was longing to be with you and to celebrate the goodness of god but circumstances have separated us at a time like this but i want you to know that the bride of jesus christ is marching on no matter what the enemy throws at us and because of precious brothers in ghana and precious brothers in alabama they have worked together and they have made this possible that i could have excuse me that i could have a small part in your convention and given the honor of speaking tonight getting things going i greet our esteemed pastor tay a true friend to me for so many years now and an apostle of this truth he has certainly pioneered so many wonderful wonderful things for the kingdom of god in the nation of ghana and has blessed the saints around the world as he has traveled even here to alabama he has been a blessing to so many so i say sir i salute you today in the name of the lord and would love to be there with you i greet your beautiful family in the name of the lord jesus christ we greet also the anointed speakers who will be ministering to you from your location in the next couple of days it's a blessing that you have again this time off work and you can gather together i pray sincerely that if jesus tarries he makes a way for me to come and be with you again i love pulling on to the church premises after not being there for some time i enjoy pulling onto those premises those blessed grounds and seeing the great progress that is made every time we come we see the goodness of god manifested with expansion and with his blessing and it just really thrills us we look around and we see so many things changing in the world around us and most of those things have brought a lot of sorrow and a lot of heartache to many families around the world but we want to say as believers that we trust the sovereign hands of god we know that he never fails and he never makes a mistake and so we just say together in all of the transitions that we have gone through in the last couple of years we just say together god is good say that with me god is good he is faithful and above all he is good he never fails well we have had wonderful blessings from the lord here in alabama over the last couple of years he has been faithful he is working and building up his bride we're seeing god's provision and his help for us both spiritually and physically my wife and i had the covet virus and we saw the hand of god move in just an amazing way and with many in our congregation who experienced it god was faithful and he brought them out and they are living testimonies of god's goodness and also his sovereignty we don't always know why things happen the way they do but we know that we are in great big capable hands in the midst of all the negative things that we see and hear in the news i have some good news that i want to share with you today you rejoiced with me there at bible believers fellowship when god gave me a wonderful wife uh it was announced to you and you shouted and praised god with me for his gift and you have done that through many milestones in my life and i think the next one was about nine months later when god gave us our first son benjamin judah who you have met he has been with me along with joshua our next son uh benjamin has played the drums and they're in the sanctuary of bible believers fellowship and if you haven't heard already it's our great joy to share with you the good news that uh over the course of the last few days he has asked the beautiful genocider to be his wife and she has accepted and so now they are engaged to be married sometime next year god willing i wanted to share that news with you because you i'm choking up again because you are a part of my family and you have prayed for me and been such a blessing in my life i want to bless you today i want to share with you some things that god has laid on my heart i want to say to pastor isaac and to the other speakers pastor john and whoever else might have the blessing of ministering to you i'm depending on you brothers to uh really emphasize the theme of this meeting and take it as high as you possibly can i'm here to introduce it a bit and to help break open the door but i'm praying for you men of god that you will be used in outstanding ways over the course of the next couple of days that there will be miracles among you deliverances among you healings and salvations and whatever god has but i also pray that the bride will be strengthened there to rise up in this last day for we need to get above this old stuff that we live in in this old past house of the flesh previously called to all of us satan's eden we're not bound to this earth we're not tethered to the things of this earth we've been called to a higher place and i believe those brothers are going to be mightily used of god i'm going to speak briefly about the theme of the camp and then i want to i want to move into something that i i have to bring to you today because the lord has placed it so heavily on my heart in prayer and i believe it will be a blessing and i believe that it will help you to to get up above because that's what a spiritual astronaut must do he's got to get up above all the other things that the enemy would use to try to keep us tied to this earth and in order to sort of open that up i want to just give you two quotations there are many from the message of the prophet but there are two that i want to use uh as a plow to sort of break open the ground and and show you what god has placed in my heart for you we are overcomers by the blood of the lamb by the word of our testimony and all of hell is marching against this little bride and yet there is victory that is rising up in our hearts because we know that god's word is being fulfilled in this very hour we also know that there are greater glories and greater fulfillments of this word just around the corner and so we must not give up i said we must not give up we must stay the course we must stay with the word of god with the word of the hour we must trust the lord to continue to reveal himself to us through his word and not be discouraged the enemy is using every trick in his bag to discourage us to distract us to cause us to get our eyes off of the word but we are we are spiritual astronauts and we are determined now not to be a part of this world around us the bible tells us even the words of jesus himself love not the world neither the things of the world we are loving the things of the kingdom which is another world and another dimension altogether the only way that we are going to spend eternity together in that kingdom is to let the word of god take us to higher heights let the word of god lift us up under the great inspiration of the holy ghost and strengthen us physically emotionally uh spiritually mentally in every way we are a tripartite man we are a tripartite human being we are spirit soul and body and we need to be ministered to and lifted up in all phases of who we are and there is nothing like the revealed word of the hour to feed all of that to nourish that and to cause us to see things from a different perspective in the message countdown the one that brother branham gave us in jeffersonville which was 62 paragraph 96 and any man that ever lives for god will have to go beyond any five senses i just love that word because we know the enemy will use whatever he can get his hands on even the gifts that god has given us and our five senses are a gift from god they help us to have contact with the world around us and god wants us to be able to see and discern the beauty that he has created and there are things that we need to hear and things that he's given us to taste and to feel so these senses in themselves they're not our enemies but the enemy likes to use them and brother branham said when they begin to lie against the word that's when we have to recognize how the enemy's using them and don't pay any attention to them but but listen rather to the word of god and brother branham is describing here in the countdown that spiritual astronauts must go beyond their five senses so i'm saying to you my brethren no matter what you see or what you hear what you feel what you taste no matter what your five senses might tell you in such an hour as this you are not called to live by that you were born of god predestinated of god to live by the truth of god's word and i've told you many times before we're we're not here on planet earth to be thermostats because excuse me to be a thermometer i knew i would pick the wrong word we are not here to be a thermometer a thermometer is what tells us the atmosphere around us what temperature it is right now and if that's all we do we're no different than anybody else that walks up and down the streets of tema but we're called to be the thermostat and the thermostat is is the device that has the ability to raise up the level or to lower the level of the temperature and that's who you and i are we carry the anointing of god for the end time yes we live below our means we don't always operate in that anointing but we carry i'm telling you in the name of the lord we carry the anointing to overcome in the end time and we carry an anointing to shift the atmosphere around us so may god use you through the last few days of 2021 and the entirety of 2022 if jesus tarries may you and i be used like never before to make an impact on the atmosphere around us there's never been an hour church where the world has been so fearful this this perhaps has struck more fear in people's hearts than the world wars that have previously taken place in the earth this this fear has been so tangible that you can see it and sense it and feel it on people that you may meet along the way so afraid of death so afraid of disease not understanding that above all god is sovereign and in control fear will bring torment you and i who have been called to be those spiritual astronauts we are also called to be that thermostat that we might be able to change that atmosphere of fear around us by speaking faith by living faith by practicing what we preach by really taking god at his word the prophet goes on to say here any man that ever lives for god will have to go above or beyond any five senses he'll have to go on any education any achievement that he's been able to do and believe god you can't lean on your education you can't lean on the trophies of what you have achieved you've got to move on and believe god he said break everything and lay it aside and sweep up into heaven oh he said what astronauts and so forth have been achieving in the natural god's been able to do it by his church by the spiritual the spiritual astronauts that we are called to be he said by a spiritual people who will believe we are a spiritual people you say well that sounds a little braggy well i don't mean for it to but i want to say it again and i want you to say it with me i am a spiritual person we are a spiritual people we're not called to be an earthy people a worldly people but rather a spiritual people a supernatural people who are not marching to the drumbeat of society we are not marching to the rhythm of this world hallelujah but we have another rhythm altogether there is another cadence in the bride of christ hallelujah and we are marching to that drumbeat we are moving to that cycle that god is releasing upon us in this hour the little bride church is is not going under we're going over we're not going lower we're going higher and it's because the word has been sent to do that for us you say brother shelly but we're not even free to worship and together like we did and we have to social distance and we have to wear the mask and we have to do this and we're forced to do that and it seems like things are getting darker they are things are getting darker out there but in here where the body of christ is things are not getting darker oh hallelujah things are getting brighter because it's our day to shine it's our hour to go forward in the wonderful grace of jesus christ brother branham goes on to say by a spiritual people who will believe he said any man or woman who will dare at any time any time to take god at his word is an astronaut so if you and i dare god if we will dare to take god at his word we are those spiritual astronauts that we're celebrating here in this convention we're no longer in the horse and buggy age we're no longer in the automobile age spiritually we're no longer just in the airplane age spiritually but we've been called to move by a force that is higher than than us brother branham says that in one of the countdown messages he said those astronauts they don't move by their own power at their own will he said oh no they're shot out of a tube he said it's it's a power behind them that shoots them out of here and we can say that we can say that we're not moving in the last hours of 2021 by our own strength brother sister if we're gathered together this way in the name of the lord it's by his grace it's by his power it's by his leadership we're we could be uh we could be in in a position much different than the one we're in right now i realize that many of you around uh ghana and around the nations of africa and around the world who will be watching this service today um i realize that your situations and circumstances are different and mine are different than yours but we're all facing some things in a way that we have never faced them before and if we get bogged down with what's going on around us we'll be we won't be astronauts oh no we we will be uh depressed and broken people and we will be a people failing to manifest the purpose for which we have been born and we're not going to do that we're going to get up we're going to rise up by the power of the holy spirit now one more little quotation and i'm moving on it's from the countdown this is the one he gave in shreveport louisiana uh in 62 and thanksgiving time for us here in america in paragraph 76 he said the spiritual astronaut is eagles how many eagles are gathered together today i don't know where you are but god knows where you are how many eagles are out there how many eagles are gathered at bible believers fellowship sanctuary and tema ghana west africa wherever you're watching this i want you to know that god has called us to be those eagles brother branham said that's who the spiritual astronaut is he's an eagle he goes beyond all denominational creeds he goes beyond all denominational barriers all denominational thinkings all their cloudy thoughts do you really want to be involved after all these years with all the cloudy thoughts of denominationalism i tell you absolutely not to leave this pure word of the hour and to go back into that denominational way of thinking i'm telling you it seems to me like the grossest blasphemy that could be imagined it's exactly what the enemy would like to anoint some of us to do he would like to catch us in our weakness he would like to cause us to feel like we don't belong and we don't fit in and we're not a part of what is going on in the bride church and he would cause us to retreat back into something that god has already delivered us from but we say no to the enemy our eyes are not on the church our eyes are not even on our leadership our pastors our eyes are fixed on the lord jesus christ he is the captain of the host he is the chief astronaut he is above us all brother branham tells us that even christ was an astronaut and he rose above and you and i will do the same by his grace he said he goes beyond all their cloudy thoughts he goes above every cloud everything there is to look at he's up around the stars the astronaut and the astronaut believer is also up in the heavenlies he's far beyond these earth bound things that's what i want to say to you today my family i want to say to you that we are delivered from these earthbound things he has come with his word to cut us loose to sever the ties that would bind us to the carnality and the flesh of this earth and to cause us to grow up into the spiritual beings that he has called us to be we have been given power over all the power of the enemy and we must take that power and we must utilize that authority in this hour and we refuse to be defeated take that satan we refuse to be defeated in fact we refuse to be influenced by those earth-bound things around us we are soaring hallelujah higher we're soaring higher above it all by the inspiration of the holy ghost that falls on this word i want you to know sometimes i can be right by myself reading this great message that god's given us or listening to it on my phone and i can be caught up into a place where for a few moments of time i forget about everything around me problems bills that need to be paid pastoring a church of people who have needs and sometimes those needs get heavy all of these things can weigh on you but the word of god can catch you up into a higher place far beyond he said far beyond these earthbound things he's up high he's in outer space i'm quoting again see the earthly man doesn't know very much about outer space but if the astronauts in outer space he's there with it in other words he understands what's going on out there in the far regions of space because he's been caught up to it and when i begin to think about that think about eagles being astronauts we're both we're spiritual eagles who have become spiritual astronauts and i began to see about that that anointing that was to be present on the bride in the last days there were four creatures that stood before the throne of god and we understand that the creature that best represents where we are in the closing hours of the church ages is the flying eagle anointing i look at that like all the other preachers and believers before me and i notice that it doesn't say a a snorting ox it doesn't say a roaring lion or a walking man it just calls them identifies them as what they are but when it gets to the eagle it doesn't just say an eagle it says as a flying eagle there's a reason for that it's an end-time message for you and i that in order to be that astronaut in order to be that overcomer we are not just eagles by spiritual nature but we are eagles who have been called to soar and so we are not ourselves when we when we choose to remain earthbound you know i have been to those zoos brother branham talked about being there with little joseph and seeing that eagle all bound up in that cage and sometimes it's because the eagle has been harmed he has had some kind of an accident sometimes hit by a vehicle or someone is shot at him and he could not be rehabilitated to the point of living in the wild it seems quite unfair doesn't it for the the eagle to be bound like that but in some cases it's the only way he can have any sense of normal life at all but you and i are not that kind of an eagle the kind that has to remain on the earth we've had a wounded wing or two haven't we we've had some shots fired at us haven't we but god by his grace has poured the healing virtue of jesus christ over all of our wounds and he has anointed us that we would renew ourselves he's given us renewal and refreshment he's given us refillings of the holy ghost and so we are wiser eagles than we once were we are refusing to remain in our handicap we are refusing to remain in a state of injury when the lord has healed us and so the overcoming portion for the believer in the last age is the anointing of a flying eagle one that has not remained earthbound but one that has understood his privileges hallelujah he has understood that he was not born to live on the earth just walk around like any other animal or domestic animal you might see out there walk around like a dog or a cat oh no he has the grace and the gifted ability to fly oh to get up above it all and when i thought of that i looked again at some of the statistics that i have preached through the years about the eagle and the first one that caught my mind was that the eagle has the ability to soar at 10 000 feet did you know that most large passenger jets are flying at 30 to 35 000 feet so we're looking at an eagle and if you search it out you'll find no other bird is capable of remaining or most of them getting to that place if they can get there they can't remain but this that eagle has been specially built that he is able to soar to the height of ten thousand feet which is about three kilometers straight up in the air no other bird can do it he was created to do it he was specially built to do it and i want to say to you so were you you are created to get up above the atmosphere around you maybe the family is in a stir a stew a turmoil maybe there's problems with your job with your employment maybe finances have really taken a beating through this kind of pandemic and you're wringing your hands in concern and worry let me tell you my brother my sister you don't have to live in all of that depression you don't have to live in the squeezing of the enemy you've got something that others around you don't have you are not like every other bird you're not like every other man i i started looking at the astronaut school and just spent a little time reading and out of tens of thousands of people who want to be an astronaut it's amazing what a small number actually gets to live their dream well i want you to know you're one of the few hallelujah you're one of the few out of all the other birds who can't get to the 10 000 feet range to get up above the storm to get up above the wind and the rain and the turmoil and the disease and the affliction and the infirmity of earth's atmosphere but you my friend you my brother sister were born for that purpose that you would be able to just stretch your head and set your wings and allow the wind of the holy spirit hallelujah to carry you up up up up up above above above everything else and you're just saying goodbye to all the other birds that would flock around you as the old song we sing the old the other birds would like to flock around and and they call out and they don't understand they don't understand who you are they don't understand why you have been elected they don't understand why you don't have to be tossed around by the storms of this life they they just really don't understand but it's because you were chosen from before the foundation of the world you were built in a certain way just like the eagle was so that you can get under this word and this word will lift you up hallelujah this word will elevate you and raise you into a new dimension into a new place in the spirit will you yield to him and allow him to do that somebody said well you you haven't even taken your text yet that's right but i will before we close i will take my text but i want to finish this that eagle can get up above it all and what i have found out in my years of life is that if you can get up just a little higher than what you're going through and take a good look around just kind of stretch your head above the fence you know and see what's on the other side the enemy raises up fences to keep us from seeing the rest of the story the rest of the story he wants us focused on the bleak on the black on the dark on the negative on the pain on the suffering he wants us to focus on all that is wrong around us but oh my brother sister if you can just get your head up above the fence and look above the boundary and and survey the wondrous ability of god the wondrous power of god to give us the victory when we need it to raise us up with the wind of the spirit so that we can fly above it all i want you to know if you get up in that airplane i've never been in a in a a rocket ship but if you can get up in that airplane what looks so big down here on the earth these big buildings that we have in major cities around the world you can stand on the ground and look up 30 stories 40 stories right straight up in the air you can get in a building so tall that that you can feel it when you get to the top you can feel a slight sway it's built to do that it's built with an understanding that that is actually better than it being completely static completely stationary it needs that little bit of give for the wind and the storm i've been high enough in a building that i could feel that well i want you to know if you're standing out in front of that you can hardly look up and see the top it looks so huge but if you can go up on the top of that building and look down then you look down to those little people standing there looking up at that building and they look like little ants but if you can get in an airplane get way up above 30 000 feet if it's a clear day you can't always see that that if you're that high you can't always see the ground but if it's a clear day you look back down and that little building that looks so big uh when you were standing there looking at it it looks like a tiny little cracker box or something down on the ground and you can't even see the people that were standing there they're so little so perspective changes everything and the enemy knows that the devil knows that so he wants to keep us uh earthbound let's just say it that way he wants to keep us attached to this old earth but you have been given the grace of a flying eagle anointing that will take you so high that when you look at that problem that looks so big so insurmountable so impassable and impossible just a few minutes ago once you get caught up in that anointing as an astronaut you get up above it all and look down your perspective is entirely different so we've got to recognize who we are as the eagles and we've got to recognize who we are as god's end-time spiritual astronauts the eagle has the sharpest vision at a higher height of any other bird did you know that an eagle's vision is four to eight times sharper than the human eye and even though the eagle is small in comparison to a man his eye is almost the identical size as the eye of a man which gives him an incredible ability to see he has this great ability not only to see sharper but he also has the ability to see sharply from a long distance and we are told that an eagle can focus in on a jumping rabbit at 3.2 kilometers which for the rest of us over here is two miles a two mile distance between the eagle and the rabbit and the eagle can see that rabbit or what i have watched the eagle do is fly over a lake and you could be sitting in a boat and you wouldn't be able to see that fish if you were looking straight down into the water you couldn't see it but that eagle a mile up up in the air or more can look down in that water and see that fish if you've never seen it i wish you could he comes flying down out of the sky and goes on sometimes beneath the surface at least partially beneath the surface to catch that fish and you're thinking how in the world did he ever see it from up there he was built for that he was created for that and so it's no coincidence that brother branham called the spiritual astronauts eagles or believers eagles he got it right from the word of god where the believer the prophetic believer is referred to as an eagle and when i get that down in my spirit and i recognize at times that i am moping around in my circumstances just earthbound got more got more on my mind from this old world than i do from who i really am as a believer and when i catch myself doing that i cry out to the lord and what i usually do is instead of praying god help me i usually just raise my hand and start praising him singing some praise to him and you know what he that wind of the holy spirit will catch my wings and he will lift me above all of that circumstance he'll take me to a higher place in him now i have to take my text and i won't get to all of this but but it's out there this is a portion of a message that i brought to the church this past sunday and it's out there it's on the app and it's on youtube and it's on facebook and you can get the rest of it if if you're interested in it and i'm not here to trying to advertise something but i recognize that in the time i have i'll only hit a little of it but the the text that i want to leave you with that was my effort to help set the tone for these spiritual astronauts that are going to be gathering hallelujah for the next few days there in the great bible believers fellowship sanctuary and around the world i wanted to set the tone i got a little carried away though didn't i but the the the text that i have that i've got to give you is isaiah 54 17. it says no weapon say that with me no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall oh i want to stop and say listen at this devil listen at this brother listen to this sister listen at this whoever you are no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the servants of the lord and their righteousness is of me saith the lord i want to read this very quickly in the amplified and i know that some people don't get their mind around that but i want to share it anyway he said but no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against you in judgment you shall show it or you shall show to be in the wrong that means you will reveal that it was not the truth it was a false accusation and you'll be able to do that by the consistency of your life this peace righteousness security triumph over opposition is the heritage of the servants of the lord we are his servants our heritage is to be an overcomer our heritage is to tear down every weapon that the enemy forms against our lives to be able to overcome that is the gift that god has given us in this hour this is the heritage of the servants of the lord those in whom the ideal servant of the lord is reproduced jesus christ is the ultimate servant of god because he said i can't do anything unless my father reveals or shows me what to do so he was the word made flesh totally surrendered to the will of the eternal spirit of the father such oneness such surrender such obedience so we are we are being trained to be the servants of the lord and our example is the greatest servant of the lord of all times and it's the life of christ that's being reproduced in us this is the resurrect excuse me this is the righteousness or the vindication which they obtained from me this is that which i impart to them as their justification says the lord hallelujah that blesses my blesser because i have no very little righteousness of my own to bring i could never stand in the holiness of god with what little bit of righteousness i can produce but i don't stand there in my righteousness hallelujah i stand there in his righteousness i stand there covered by what he has done on my behalf now i want you to know that god has promised you and i victory over all of our enemies he has promised us deliverance from all the weapons that are formed against us in this hour whether it's sickness whether it's the curse of words whether it's difficulty with finance or family troubles or or barrenness whatever the enemy is forming as a weapon against your life the word of god has said it will not prosper now how do i keep it from prospering i come into agreement with god's word i refuse to be shaped by the weapons that the enemy forms against me i refuse to walk in days of dark deep depression when the word of the hour has helped me to identify who i am and i recognize that i am called to sit in high places to sit together with christ in an elevated place far above the darkness of this whole world called to dwell where astronauts are to call to live and soar where eagles fly this is my heritage and what we recognize about these enemies that are used against us and sometimes it's a it's a person it can be a person sometimes it's cancer or a virus some sort of disease that the enemy uses against us as a weapon to destroy us but when we look at what the prophet of god told us the last great battle would be about he told us in the greatest battle ever fought that it would be on the battlefield of the mind it would be the greatest battle that we were ever fighting and it would be on the battlefield of the mind but he also let us know that it's not only the greatest battle ever fought it is the last battle that the bride will ever have to fight when we win the battle in the mind when we are able to shut down the reasonings of the devil when we are able to rise above them with the anointing of the flying eagle and get up to where we can sit with christ in heavenly places and he can reproduce his life he can reproduce his image in us when we come to that the battle is forever over so we are on a journey and we are winning one battle at a time one victory at a time one healing at a time one deliverance at a time but there's coming an hour when we will finish the greatest battle ever fought we will once and for all be the astronaut that we were born to be the eagle that we were born to be there is coming an hour where we will so be done be so finished so done with our own thinking we have really pulled it down cast it down and applied the word of god to it and renewed it by the unction of the holy spirit until we can then say we have the mind of christ and when we are fully functioning in that mind of christ then the greatest battle is the battle that has come to an end hallelujah and i believe that that is my destiny i believe that is your destiny we have won that battle in our heart we have we have potentially received the victory that jesus christ has won on our behalf but we're having to live that thing out every day and what we find out is that sometimes we become the weapon that is formed against us our lives we become the weapon that's formed against our own life how is that possible it's not like we take a gun and shoot ourselves in the foot it's not like we we attack ourselves in some physical way how is it that we become the weapon that is formed against our own life and well-being i can easily show you it is in the mind it is by our own stinking thinking it is because we do too much thinking on our own and not enough of that divine exchange where we exchange our own thoughts and our own way our own will for his thoughts for his ways for his will it becomes such a battle and i asked the lord let me just give you the scripture in psalm 141 and 3 he said set a watch o lord before my mouth and keep the door of my lips i want you to know god wants to cooperate with you he wants to help you win the battle of of words and thoughts the prophet told us that a word is a thought expressed so if your words are rotten it's because your thoughts are rotten and you say i just don't understand why that has much to do with overcoming spiritually and getting up above well i'll tell you why because thoughts matter and what we think affects every part of our life so i ask the lord lord give me a few thoughts give me a few things that i can share that are ways that we sometimes become the weapon formed against our own lives and the first thought that he brought to me by inspiration was by holding on to our own stinking thinking by holding on to our own negative thoughts proverbs 23 and 7 says for as he thinketh in his heart so is he you see we become what we think our thoughts form our lives how is that possible because our thoughts form our decisions our decisions form our actions our behaviors what we do and what we do ultimately determines how we walk out the destiny that god has given us in this hour everything my friend starts with a thought i dare say every person listening to the sound of my voice has a battle from time to time if not all the time in the mind in the thought life and those negative thoughts sometimes referred to as ants because they are automatic negative thoughts that come into the mind because we have wired them into our brain by harboring those thoughts by entertaining those thoughts my old granny used to say and it's an old southern expression brother branham used something similar to it she said you can't keep a bird from flying over your head but you don't have to stand still and let him build a nest in your hair it's the same way a thought can certainly fly by it can certainly come up in your mind but you have to make a decision as an astronaut you have to make a decision as an eagle are you going to let that thought become a weight on your shoulder are you going to let it become a noose around your neck or a gun in your hand are you going to allow that thought to become a weapon that the enemy is forming and helping you inspiring you to form that brings destruction and damage to your own spiritual being we must cast down all imaginations every thought that exalts itself against the knowledge of jesus christ and we're thinking some people upwards of a hundred thousand thoughts a day and some people it's much less twenty thousand thirty thousand thoughts a day come into our mind and everything begins with a thought and thoughts matter and if our mind doesn't change our life won't change if our thoughts don't change then we can't see real change in our life but if we change our mind change our words then we change our words because our thoughts have changed and then we see our life beginning to follow suit watch your thoughts because your thoughts become your actions and eventually become your destiny they become the pattern and the path that you walk out in life thoughts create your moods if you find yourself in a grouchy mood it's because you have allowed thoughts to enter in that have disturbed your sense of peace the sense of well-being that god has given you as a part of his little bride and so you can come into an angry mood a foul mood a depressed mood a sad mood a grumpy mood just by allowing a thought to stay too long and start building some kind of nest in your head in your hair you have the power by the grace of god to overcome that and to cast that down i wish that i had time to to break that down a little more for you but i want you to know that one of the ways that we allow our own selves to become the weapon that's formed against our life is by keep not keeping our thoughts centered on christ not keeping our thoughts centered on the word it's so important to recognize that many many physicians and doctors are telling us today that 75 to 98 of all mental physical emotional and behavioral illnesses are formed from a bad thought life yes your thoughts can even affect your physical body they can affect the organs of your body and if you think this is some kind of new age uh hocus pocus you need to do some more digging around the message of the hour because brother branham in those prayer lines he would minister to people and he would say you're in this fix you're a nervous person you cross your bridges before you come to them and god wants to give you strength to get out of that and when you do your body will be healed and so there is a vindicated prophet helping us to understand that your thoughts have a great impact on your physical well-being and i can tell you for sure your thoughts have a great impact on your spiritual well-being so let's not be the weapon formed against ourselves there's something called a negativity bias and we don't have time to talk about that today but but it's just like a spirit that really kind of forms on us and we just start looking at everything negative it doesn't matter how positive it is it looks negative to us it doesn't matter how wonderful it is what god is doing we think it's the most awful thing that ever happened and it's a it's a bias that we form in our own mind and the enemy oh he just rejoices when when believers become so negative when they become so doubt-filled instead of faith field he just becomes so just really victorious he just dances all around because he realizes he's winning the battle of the mind against you if that's if that's how you're responding in the message testimony of the raising the dead boy in 1953 brother branham said here's an old slogan i want you to remember do right that's your duty to god think right that's your duty to yourself and then you're bound to be right so if you want to be right before god watch your thoughts the second way that the lord brought to me was that we can become the the weapon formed against our own life is by carrying offense we must let it go in the name of jesus we must not carry roots of bitterness against one another and i could expand that if time would let me but search your heart first of all search your mind for negative thoughts and submit them to the word of god second of all search your heart for any root of bitterness or offense that you may be carrying against any brother or any sister and as the prophet told us take that grubbing hole and dig that out of your life and the third thing that god spoke to me about in making this list was that we make a mistake when we remain in unforgiveness we must be a people who forgive it doesn't matter how many times seven times no no seventy times seven and if you are struggling to forgive somebody i want you to take a moment and step back and i want you to think of the things that god has forgiven you of time after time after time after time after time i've called on him for help he has helped me he has forgiven me he has set me free and i want you to know that makes me once i come to that understanding it makes me want to show the same compassion to others that he has shown to be i believe with all my heart i i would just love to take some more uh scriptures here and some more quotes but i i've gotten out an outline and i'm going to leave it with you i would just hope and pray that every one of us would enter into a new year of 2022 with a fresh slate that we would just repent before god of our negative thought life and we would just repent of any grudge that we're holding on to against someone else any root of bitterness that we've allowed the enemy to form in us and that we would search our lives to see if there is someone that we are walking in unforgiveness toward choosing not to forgive instead of choosing to forgive if we will act be actively involved in keeping our own life and vessels sanctified and clean before god not just the way we dress and present ourselves outwardly but most importantly how we are inwardly this is what god seems to be dealing with us about in this hour getting down into the root of the matter and allowing the holy spirit of god to deal with each part of who we are when we do that then we will not resist the anointing we will not resist the move of god's spirit that comes among us to lift us up above all the the mundane ugliness of life heartache and hardship and troubles and problems and depression choose today my brother sister to be the spiritual astronaut that god has called you to be choose today to be the eagle to soar before god with the overcoming flying eagle anointing getting up above all of this other stuff that has been such a weight around our necks i believe that a victorious bride is standing ready in this hour to do the work of god so that we can all catch a rapture i was going to close with a another quotation about the the from the countdown about the rapture but i'm going to leave that for one of these other brothers to minister to you i just believe that you're going to have a rapture time i do i believe you're going to be caught up into glorious places over the course of the next few days my heart is there with you i can't even tell you my eyes just filled with tears and my heart gets all choked up when i think about you and when i think about how so many of you have stood the test of time going forth to declare the goodness of god and his grace to us in this glorious message the revelation of jesus christ i send you my love and i'm going off today praying for you that you will search your hearts and make sure that you are not being a weapon formed against your own success jesus is the same yesterday today and forever father i lift up the saints of god in ghana west africa and all of our brothers and sisters around the world we are yours by the new birth we have surrendered oh god to your election of grace i ask today that you would help us to take the grubbing hoe of your word dig out any root of bitterness oh god discover any place of unforgiveness if we need to go and make it right may we have courage to go and make it right give us grace to identify all these negative thoughts and the imaginations of our mind that can keep us from receiving what you have for us i pray god that deliverance will follow these meetings i pray that shackles will fall off and that bondages will break in the mighty name of jesus and that the saints will go forth rejoicing that we are free by the blood of the lamb and we have been made to recognize who we are in this hour raise us up i pray raise us up in the flying eagle anointing raise us up as those spiritual astronauts you've already made the way to get us above all the other ages now lord help us to be faithful to serve you as you have called us to do release healing in the name of the lord jesus christ over this body i pray amen and amen i i just say one more time to all of you god bless you thank you for letting me be a part of this convention and i will turn this service back over to the leadership there god bless you all happy new year to every one of you bye bye for now you
