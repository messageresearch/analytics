[0:00] but i do not have to surrender
[0:03] the light
[0:12] our refuge is a person
[0:15] in this person there is a place
[0:18] in this place there is a peace
[0:21] there is a rest that comes and from that
[0:25] peace
[0:25] in that peace there is a posture
[0:29] there is a position that we can stand
[0:32] and that is one who looks the enemy
[0:35] eye to eye who can stand toe to
[0:39] toe with the destroyer and say i am
[0:42] not afraid of you my god is a refuge
[0:46] and a very present help in the time of
[0:49] trouble
[0:50] and i will not yield one inch
[0:54] as long as you are light
[0:59] as long as you have his life
[1:03] in him was life and his
[1:06] life whoa what's the light of men
[1:12] and the light shine and the darkness
[1:15] could not put it out
[1:18] so as long as you and i are on planet
[1:21] earth
[1:23] there is a measure of sanity
[1:26] that must remain and there is a light
[1:30] bearing that can never be put out
[1:33] where is the light you
[1:36] and i are bearers
[1:40] we are torch bearers
[1:43] we are carriers of the light
[1:46] and that light is the life
[1:49] of jesus christ and all the gates of
[1:53] hell
[1:54] will march against that light
[1:59] but i don't care how dark it gets out
[2:01] there
[2:02] i can't change that but i do
[2:06] not have to surrender the light
[2:10] his life is the light of men
[2:14] and it's in the bride our refuge is not
[2:17] some mystical misty place out there
[2:22] in the in the eons of of eternity and
[2:25] time
[2:26] our refuge is a person and he
[2:30] lives inside of the believer
[2:33] there's a hiding place right in here
