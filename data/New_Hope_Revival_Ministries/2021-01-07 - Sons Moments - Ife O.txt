TRANSCRIPT
========================================
what god was really after was he was after sons he is going to have sons to fellowship with throughout all eternity god is not setting up a honeymoon only he's setting up a kingdom in a new heaven and a new earth that has no date it has no expiration date upon it it won't be just a thousand years that's the honeymoon that leads to the eternity a thousand years is still measured in time and that's not what we're working toward we're not working toward a millennial honeymoon we're moving toward and launching forth toward an eternity in fellowship with a sovereign god he didn't want to dwell eternally in a tent he wanted to dwell temporarily in a tent he wanted to dwell temporarily in a temple made by the hands of men solomon's temple herod's remodeled temple it goes on but god's ultimate purpose was not to live under badger skins in a dusty old tent in the wilderness somewhere what god was really after was he was after sons hallelujah what about daughters sons that's not leaving out the female that's pulling her all the way in to god's economy when we talk about his bride his bride his sons they're the same body these are different relationships that we have in the natural to help us understand the greatest relationship of them all our spiritual fellowship our spiritual relationship with the sovereign god he wanted to live in sons once made of flesh like we say so often the son of god became a son of man that we the fallen sons of men might become the sons of god
