TRANSCRIPT
========================================
they formed a God that was more like them than the god of the Bible did you know that's the very motive of religion in this hour to recreate a God in the image of man that's not what happened in the beginning in the beginning God made a man in the image of God and a man fell and so God came down and walked as a man that he might restore man back to the place of authority that he was given in the beginning made in the image and the likeness of almighty God a god with a little G the prophet tells us a god with a portion of deity in him a man with a portion of deity in him making him a little G God it's so scriptural that the New Testament tells us that those who receive that trans formation will have the power to forgive sin or to retain sin these are the ambassadors of God in the end time these are the god men of the last age and we can say and women because this is not a genderless message this is the manifestation of the sons of God that the world gets so bent out of shape on because perhaps okay it has been taken out of context and misused but the reality is the same the scripture tells us that all of creation is groaning for the full manifestation of the god men the sons of God to come forth oh they're the children of the Manchild they are The Offspring of the of the original the one who who became the perfect one right he wasn't the perfect one as soon as he condescended into flesh he was then no longer 100% perfect his Spirit was his flesh not that's why the Bible said though he were a son yet he had to learn he learned Perfection by the things he suffered oh what an example folks God loved us so much he loves us so much he loved us so much in the beginning that he he devised a plan that that's the greatest plan it's the best deal I'm telling you if you don't want no part of it you are losing out you are missing out brother this relationship with God to become what he created us to be in the beginning it's a process it's a battle it's not all easy it's full of Hard Knocks and high places and Low Places and Curves in the road and valleys and mountain tops and hills and abs and flow and the river flow all that stuff and yet it's worth it all to be made like him you don't have to pull God down to understand him he came down he condescended so that you could be filled with who he is
