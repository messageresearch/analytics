[40:51] hallelujah
[40:56] hallelujah i was listening this week
[41:00] sometimes you just have to listen to get
[41:02] the context
[41:04] and i was listening this week to a
[41:05] message called the influence of another
[41:09] brother branham was talking about when
[41:12] uzziah
[41:14] had gone where he was not supposed to be
[41:16] into the tabernacle into the temple
[41:19] he got leprosy
[41:21] isaiah
[41:23] he was
[41:24] grieved about this
[41:26] he said i saw the lord
[41:29] high and lifted up
[41:31] [Music]
[41:32] and his train filled the temple
[41:36] he was talking about those seraphim
[41:39] that were crying holy holy holy unto the
[41:42] lord
[41:44] the reason i said sometimes you have to
[41:46] listen because he said
[41:48] though seraphim we're not saying holy
[41:51] holy holy unto the lord
[41:55] they're crying holy
[41:57] holy holy unto the lord
[42:00] who was and is and is to come holy
[42:05] they were lifting their voices to the
[42:07] lord
[42:08] we need to open our mouth and let the
[42:10] praises of our god be heard
[42:13] oh
[42:14] hallelujah
[42:16] praise god
[42:19] i'm glad i served the risen savior
[42:22] he's in the world today
[42:25] the rest of the world may not recognize
[42:27] it
[42:28] oh there's a lot of people that can
[42:30] deliver religious talk
[42:34] people that are heathens
[42:36] say the coming of the lord must be very
[42:38] near
[42:40] because they've heard
[42:42] that there would be signs of the time
[42:45] but you know that doesn't save people
[42:48] it doesn't deliver them
[42:50] oh
[42:51] when we surrender our lives to the lord
[42:53] jesus
[42:55] there's something that takes place
[42:56] there's something that transpires inside
[42:58] of us that causes us to want to press in
[43:02] with everything that we are into the
[43:04] presence of god and see how that he'll
[43:07] change our lives and change our
[43:09] atmosphere why because we have been made
[43:12] atmosphere creators
[43:15] we can create the atmosphere around us
[43:17] and we have been given position in the
[43:20] in the kingdom of god that we can change
[43:23] the atmosphere around us

[56:41] i wanted to mention that on the
[56:45] monday
[56:46] after the wedding
[56:48] jenna's precious
[56:50] grandfather and grandmother brother and
[56:52] sister siler
[56:55] he will be 89 shortly and she just will
[56:59] soon be turning 80
[57:01] and they were
[57:03] uh on their way home to arkansas
[57:06] and they had taken some time driving
[57:08] because of their
[57:10] age and uh you know it's
[57:13] really a congested area there in the
[57:16] metroplex of of dallas fort worth and
[57:19] uh we had lunch with them on sunday
[57:23] after the service
[57:25] and we were
[57:26] blessing one another with safety and
[57:29] he said i know we're gonna make it
[57:32] he said we don't have to be concerned he
[57:34] said i know we're gonna make it brother
[57:36] shelly all the way back to where we come
[57:37] from he said because we're both
[57:39] following that bethlehem star
[57:43] he said that'll lead us all the way to
[57:46] eternity and it'll lead you back to
[57:48] alabama and it'll lead me back to
[57:50] arkansas
[57:52] that really touched me
[57:54] and it went deep in my heart
[57:57] the next morning they got up early to
[57:59] make their way back to arkansas and
[58:01] about 45 minutes away from where they
[58:04] were staying at with jenna's uncle and
[58:06] aunt they were in a major accident
[58:10] that totaled out their car
[58:13] completely totaled their vehicle
[58:16] and there was a dispute about whose
[58:18] fault it was
[58:19] but
[58:20] you know god sees he knows
[58:23] and it's no fun to tangle with an
[58:25] 18-wheeler i'll tell you that right now
[58:27] but you know they were fine
[58:30] sore
[58:31] bruised
[58:33] a little bit of sore neck
[58:35] spun the car spun around several times
[58:39] and yet they were taken to the hospital
[58:41] and checked out and told that they would
[58:43] be fine
[58:44] and they're already working on the
[58:46] vehicle and that was that bethlehem star
[58:50] somebody said well why didn't that keep
[58:52] them from having the accident i don't
[58:54] know
[58:55] i don't know why it didn't these things
[58:57] just happen
[58:59] but i want you to know no one could deny
[59:01] at their age that it was a miracle for
[59:03] them to be in a totaled out vehicle
[59:06] with an 18-wheeler and i think they made
[59:08] contact with the 18-wheeler more than
[59:10] once twice at least and spun them around
[59:14] in the highway
[59:16] and the and he's telling telling jenna's
[59:18] dad uh i'm not even i'm not upset i'm
[59:22] not it's all right
[59:25] that is the faithfulness of god
[59:28] i said that's a big old black eye for
[59:30] the devil
[59:32] he wanted to
[59:33] [Applause]
[59:37] god had been with us in such a precious
[59:40] way
[59:41] throughout the whole week and the enemy
[59:43] would like to have come and what a stain
[59:45] it would have been in our memory
[59:47] had they been broken
[59:49] not even to think about their lives have
[59:52] been taken but even even serious injury
[59:55] would have grieved us for a long long
[59:57] time thinking that
[59:59] they made such a sacrifice to be there
[1:00:02] and then that happened but they are back
[1:00:04] home safe
[1:00:06] in arkansas and uh jen jen
[1:00:09] uh jenna's i'll get it out in a minute
[1:00:11] her mom and dad took them back and
[1:00:12] they're safe back there and i wanted to
[1:00:14] give god glory for that
[1:00:17] we were
[1:00:18] very thankful
[1:00:20] [Applause]
[1:00:24] it was a wonderful privilege to be in
[1:00:26] service at jenna's church
[1:00:28] to see her up on the someone mentioned
[1:00:31] it recently
[1:00:32] upon the platform playing the violin
[1:00:36] and uh brother george smith uh
[1:00:39] was in rare form as he often is
[1:00:43] and he spoke that morning
[1:00:46] and it was wonderful being there with
[1:00:47] all those precious people
[1:00:50] and
[1:00:50] many of them said i hope you'll just go
[1:00:53] back and greet everybody for us and you
[1:00:55] may not know them but they're part of
[1:00:57] the great big family of god
[1:01:00] and we were just blessed i
[1:01:02] i don't often say a blast you know that
[1:01:04] sounds just like the young people in the
[1:01:06] world
[1:01:08] but i had a blast
[1:01:10] i had the most wonderful week of my life
[1:01:13] and that is the truth
[1:01:15] and uh it was just ordered of the lord
[1:01:17] and everything was so smooth and i'm i
[1:01:21] was so tired my wife and i were so tired
[1:01:24] when we got back we felt like great
[1:01:26] grandparents
[1:01:28] we did
[1:01:30] three days and i'm i'm not quite
[1:01:32] recovered yet
[1:01:34] but we hit the ground running we didn't
[1:01:36] even get to check in our
[1:01:38] our uh uh
[1:01:40] estate
[1:01:41] we uh went straight to eat with jenna's
[1:01:44] family when we landed and that is the
[1:01:46] truth we never slowed down uh much the
[1:01:49] whole week but god was good and what a
[1:01:51] joy it was to to go about with you
[1:01:54] precious people there
[1:01:56] and there were so many who said
[1:01:59] you mean there are over 50 of your
[1:02:02] church people that drove or flew to be a
[1:02:05] part of this wedding there were so many
[1:02:07] people just blown away by the fact that
[1:02:09] so many of you came
[1:02:11] and after we got home i was sitting
[1:02:13] there and my mind went back
[1:02:15] to that time when benjamin was born
[1:02:18] and i remembered the same thing being
[1:02:20] said by the nurses that day
[1:02:23] they said we've never seen such a
[1:02:24] support system
[1:02:26] she said there are over 50 people in the
[1:02:28] waiting room right now waiting for the
[1:02:30] news
[1:02:31] that that your son has been born
[1:02:34] you've got the most amazing uh support
[1:02:37] system
[1:02:38] and in those days
[1:02:40] you know you didn't take your baby and
[1:02:42] isolate them like like it seems uh
[1:02:44] people are doing these days
[1:02:46] anybody who stayed
[1:02:49] held benjamin the night he was born
[1:02:52] and those who didn't hold him the day
[1:02:54] was born they came back the next day and
[1:02:56] held him
[1:02:57] and the nurses just stand amazed they
[1:02:59] said we don't know we don't know who
[1:03:01] this baby is but there's a lot of folks
[1:03:04] that love him and love his family
[1:03:07] and so you proved again your love for
[1:03:09] our family and we appreciate that so
[1:03:12] very very much
[1:03:14] and then the thought of having to
[1:03:17] i told you when i was here the last
[1:03:19] service to see ben and kendra drive off
[1:03:22] in that
[1:03:23] sunset and know they were going on their
[1:03:25] honeymoon we wouldn't see them for a
[1:03:26] week and i just burst out in tears
[1:03:29] i didn't have to do that
[1:03:32] because we knew we were going to see
[1:03:34] them the next day
[1:03:35] [Music]
[1:03:36] that was such a blessing we all met at
[1:03:39] an old-fashioned pancake house
[1:03:43] in fort worth
[1:03:44] and somebody said well the food was just
[1:03:46] average i said it was exceptional to me
[1:03:50] because it was like it was like sitting
[1:03:52] in a vintage
[1:03:54] you know how
[1:03:55] how instagram is filled with vintage
[1:03:59] what we call old old garbage you know
[1:04:01] just old trash now it's vintage
[1:04:04] and rusty but it was the old atmosphere
[1:04:07] and uh i think charity called and got
[1:04:10] the room and we had our a room to
[1:04:12] ourselves
[1:04:13] and those people took notice of that
[1:04:16] they kept mentioning it we went up there
[1:04:18] to the someone among us paid the bill
[1:04:21] for everybody to eat breakfast
[1:04:24] what a what a wonderful thing to do for
[1:04:26] us
[1:04:28] and i i wanted a mug so i went up to buy
[1:04:30] my mug and the lady said i've never seen
[1:04:33] people like you
[1:04:34] she said i've never seen people like you
[1:04:37] she said there's just something about
[1:04:38] you she said it was as though when you
[1:04:40] come in the whole room just shifted and
[1:04:43] lit up she said i i just i've never seen
[1:04:46] anything quite like this and big tears
[1:04:49] come up in her eyes and i said it's
[1:04:51] jesus i tell you it's not us
[1:04:55] it's only him he's the only one that can
[1:04:57] make a difference like that
[1:04:59] and then we got to spend the day with
[1:05:01] him and then
[1:05:03] go to church with him on sunday and
[1:05:04] jenna's pastor brother mcgary he
[1:05:07] mentioned the fact he said we don't
[1:05:09] often see the newlyweds the sunday after
[1:05:12] the wedding and he said it was just
[1:05:13] special to us
[1:05:15] to have them here today
[1:05:17] and
[1:05:18] we saw god move we saw god do some
[1:05:21] things and we knew that it was him and
[1:05:23] he deserves the praise
[1:05:26] and we knew there were people back home
[1:05:28] praying for us and thinking about us and
[1:05:31] waiting to see pictures
[1:05:33] and videos and i know there are people
[1:05:36] oh wait you know there are people that
[1:05:37] look for a reason to be critical
[1:05:41] i just don't have time to study those
[1:05:43] people
[1:05:44] you know i don't i don't have time for
[1:05:46] that kind of negative negativity in my
[1:05:48] life
[1:05:49] and the thought come to my mind i know
[1:05:50] there's people ah there's another
[1:05:52] picture
[1:05:54] and i said i don't care
[1:05:57] i don't care don't look at them
[1:06:00] because i've got church people back at
[1:06:02] home that couldn't be here and i want
[1:06:04] them to know what's going on i want them
[1:06:07] to see it
[1:06:08] and we were just blessed
[1:06:11] who would have ever thought that sister
[1:06:13] flo would have flown to texas to be
[1:06:15] there
[1:06:16] she was determined to be there
[1:06:19] god was just good he was just good
[1:06:23] and we're just thankful and so far so
[1:06:25] good
[1:06:26] it's worked out real well i've enjoyed
[1:06:29] being a daddy-in-law now for over a week
[1:06:32] it's lovely it's wonderful i like it
[1:06:35] and i can't wait for what
[1:06:44] god no pressure
[1:06:49] no pressure
[1:06:50] but i'm getting ready
[1:06:53] you might as well get ready if it's an
[1:06:55] hour you're soon in the room might as
[1:06:57] well get ready i've only asked one favor
[1:06:59] and that is that they not wait until i'm
[1:07:02] too old to enjoy them
[1:07:04] which could be soon so hurry
[1:07:11] god is good
[1:07:12] you that are not uh we're not able to be
[1:07:15] here today we do have some traveling
[1:07:17] ian's birthday is this week and april
[1:07:19] and uh
[1:07:20] i'm just so glad to see maul here this i
[1:07:22] thought she was off with them and then i
[1:07:24] looked up and she's in service this
[1:07:26] morning and ginger and olivia are gone
[1:07:29] for a little uh birthday trip
[1:07:32] and um
[1:07:33] those of you i think you heard it
[1:07:35] tuesday night and by the way
[1:07:37] uh the uh listen i didn't get to hear
[1:07:39] tuesday night live but i've heard it
[1:07:41] since then and you did a remarkable job
[1:07:44] on tuesday night how many of you
[1:07:45] appreciated the word
[1:07:48] i really appreciated it
[1:07:51] it's a landmark
[1:07:53] and we don't want to let these things
[1:07:56] slip
[1:07:57] and it it impacted my life i appreciated
[1:07:59] it and i think brother greeley mentioned
[1:08:01] on
[1:08:02] uh tuesday night that god made a way for
[1:08:05] hawk and mary beth
[1:08:06] i mean when i say god made a way he made
[1:08:09] a way
[1:08:10] he made a way
[1:08:12] someone someone underwrote the trip
[1:08:16] and paid the expense for them to be able
[1:08:18] to go to iceland and spend
[1:08:20] a month of time there with his family
[1:08:23] and his parents got to see esther for
[1:08:26] the first time
[1:08:27] and he's going to be involved in
[1:08:29] ministry while he's there so we are
[1:08:31] praying for them that god will use them
[1:08:35] but they stayed with us in texas and it
[1:08:38] was just so wonderful and so warm and my
[1:08:41] my i couldn't uh hold back the tears
[1:08:44] when we i had to say goodbye so i
[1:08:46] stopped in up at their house
[1:08:48] uh after we got back and gave them a
[1:08:50] quick hug and and i couldn't kept help
[1:08:53] the tears again
[1:08:55] because we just appreciate them so much
[1:08:58] and we're really going to miss them for
[1:08:59] this whole month but god will be with us
[1:09:01] and he will be with them
[1:09:03] i'm just i'm just catching up with you i
[1:09:05] know you're
[1:09:06] rushing or you think i should hurry but
[1:09:08] uh i i can't hurry just yet i want to
[1:09:11] get a few things in
[1:09:13] we're looking forward to what god is
[1:09:16] doing
[1:09:17] he's doing some things shifting some
[1:09:20] things
[1:09:22] and
[1:09:23] don't miss tuesday night
[1:09:26] you're going to want to be here tuesday
[1:09:27] night i want to introduce you to a new
[1:09:30] family that god is sending us
[1:09:33] and we know that it's him
[1:09:35] and they're precious and they've made a
[1:09:37] real sacrifice to be here
[1:09:39] and they use the word urgency in their
[1:09:42] testimony you know unspiritual people
[1:09:46] don't understand the spirit's urgency
[1:09:50] but there are people in this house
[1:09:52] that can talk to you about
[1:09:55] urgency
[1:09:56] when the spirit of god says go
[1:10:00] and you don't even have time to plot
[1:10:02] your course
[1:10:04] you just go
[1:10:05] and if there was any dragging involved
[1:10:07] it was the holy spirit dragging
[1:10:10] pushing and prodding and doing whatever
[1:10:12] he has to do to get people where they
[1:10:14] need to be for this end time move of god
[1:10:17] and we were reminiscing about some of
[1:10:20] you that came through the years
[1:10:22] and
[1:10:23] you many of you came under the same
[1:10:26] urgency under the same mandate
[1:10:28] got to get there got to get there in a
[1:10:30] hurry
[1:10:32] and uh our labor and your sacrifices are
[1:10:35] not in vain because we're about to see
[1:10:38] we are seeing
[1:10:39] we are seeing the fulfillment
[1:10:42] and i don't mean to bring this up
[1:10:45] but i can't help it it's in my mind
[1:10:48] when the lord gave us this vision to
[1:10:51] place the studio here
[1:10:54] we knew that our numbers were not
[1:10:57] such that we would need those pews there
[1:11:00] and we felt like that we were coming
[1:11:02] into alignment with a vision
[1:11:05] where god had said we'll i'll give you a
[1:11:07] pulpit to the nations
[1:11:09] but over the course of that there were
[1:11:11] some negative ninnies among us
[1:11:14] there always are
[1:11:17] you got any in your family
[1:11:19] doesn't matter what god is doing
[1:11:21] somebody's going to be negative
[1:11:23] and there was a brother twins that's
[1:11:25] right
[1:11:26] and there was a brother who said i think
[1:11:28] we have all come to accept the fact that
[1:11:32] the church will never be full
[1:11:35] you know i never came to that fact
[1:11:39] because i had a word from the lord
[1:11:43] that he was going to fill this place
[1:11:45] and that he was going to bring people
[1:11:47] from other places to fill this place
[1:11:50] we've just been waiting on it
[1:11:52] and it's been discouraging and and and
[1:11:55] heart-wrenching and uh all that goes
[1:11:58] with it and despondency and up and down
[1:12:01] and you feel positive and then you feel
[1:12:03] low and you don't see how and you start
[1:12:06] trying to figure it out on your own but
[1:12:08] but god is faithful
[1:12:11] and you're about to see it happen
[1:12:13] [Music]
[1:12:15] yes it's happening it's happening
[1:12:17] already
[1:12:23] let's stand and go to the word let's
[1:12:25] thank god for these musicians
[1:12:27] we bless you all we thank you for what
[1:12:30] god is doing
[1:12:31] i'd rather be here right now than
[1:12:34] anywhere in the whole wide world
[1:12:39] i wouldn't want to be pitching my tent
[1:12:41] anywhere but right here
[1:12:44] why because it's where god called me
[1:12:48] and uh
[1:12:49] you know they say well you ought not to
[1:12:50] brag so much i think everybody
[1:12:54] ought to feel that way about where they
[1:12:55] worship
[1:12:57] everybody ought to have that same kind
[1:12:59] of passion
[1:13:00] and believe that this is the place
[1:13:03] hallelujah
[1:13:05] and there's no place i know like this
[1:13:07] place
[1:13:08] so this must be the place
[1:13:12] it's the place for me
[1:13:14] all right praise god is that enough of
[1:13:16] that
[1:13:23] acts
[1:13:25] chapter 16
[1:13:27] i'm going to throw them off in the sound
[1:13:29] booth this was the
[1:13:31] first
[1:13:32] scripture on the new sheet and
[1:13:35] they told me there's something going on
[1:13:37] with that computer up there i never
[1:13:39] heard the explanation quite like they
[1:13:41] gave it but
[1:13:44] it appears that the computer is too
[1:13:46] smart for the software
[1:13:50] so i said well what am i supposed to do
[1:13:52] buy a dumber computer
[1:13:54] or how do i how do we make that work
[1:13:56] better
[1:13:57] so it seems that somehow this software
[1:14:00] is kind of bogging down a little bit and
[1:14:02] charity wanted me to know that ahead of
[1:14:04] time so i wouldn't apply too much extra
[1:14:07] pressure
[1:14:08] for for the scriptures and the quotes so
[1:14:10] they'll be here
[1:14:12] and we'll just have to be patient with
[1:14:13] them today until we can get that taken
[1:14:15] care of these fans are on because
[1:14:18] evidently this air conditioning has gone
[1:14:21] out again while we were away and maybe
[1:14:23] even during the storm
[1:14:25] we don't know what the problem is but
[1:14:27] but we'll get it working when we can and
[1:14:30] so it's a little cooler in the back i
[1:14:32] hope you'll forgive us and bring your
[1:14:35] fox and your mink and whatever you have
[1:14:37] your furs and wrap up and
[1:14:40] faux fur and whatever because we'll run
[1:14:42] it a little cooler to try to make a
[1:14:44] little bit of a difference up here
[1:14:46] acts chapter 16 and verse 14
[1:14:50] and a certain woman
[1:14:53] named
[1:14:54] lydia i like that name
[1:14:57] it's a nice name
[1:14:59] lydia
[1:15:01] a seller of purple
[1:15:07] of the city of thyatira
[1:15:10] which worship god
[1:15:13] she was a god-fearing woman
[1:15:16] heard us
[1:15:18] and we're assuming that
[1:15:21] this is the apostle talking
[1:15:25] she heard us
[1:15:30] whose heart
[1:15:33] the lord
[1:15:34] opened
[1:15:37] i want you to read that phrase with me
[1:15:39] whose heart
[1:15:40] the lord
[1:15:42] opened
[1:15:44] that she attended unto the things
[1:15:48] which were spoken of paul
[1:15:51] i want to read it in the amplified
[1:15:53] version and see if you can can get a
[1:15:55] little something out of it there
[1:15:57] one of those who listened to us
[1:16:00] was a woman named lydia
[1:16:03] from the city of thytira a dealer in
[1:16:06] fabrics died in purple
[1:16:09] she was already a worshiper of god
[1:16:13] and the lord opened
[1:16:16] her heart
[1:16:19] she was already a god-fearer
[1:16:22] she already worshiped god
[1:16:24] she was already a follower of truth
[1:16:28] but the lord came and he opened up
[1:16:31] lydia's heart hallelujah
[1:16:34] and caused her to pay attention
[1:16:37] to what was said by paul
[1:16:40] the first church age
[1:16:43] messenger
[1:16:44] i've been where lydia was
[1:16:47] i've i've worshipped god all my life
[1:16:51] from the time that he visited me at 18
[1:16:54] months old i have feared his name
[1:16:57] and i have worshipped him
[1:16:59] called me at the age of three to preach
[1:17:02] his gospel and filled me with the holy
[1:17:05] ghost at the age of seven and i have
[1:17:08] followed him the best way that i know
[1:17:10] how but one day
[1:17:12] the lord opened up my heart
[1:17:15] so that i would pay attention to the
[1:17:17] last church age messenger
[1:17:20] just like lydia's heart was opened
[1:17:23] that she would pay attention to the
[1:17:26] first church age messenger my heart was
[1:17:29] opened
[1:17:30] that i might be able to pay attention
[1:17:33] to carefully study and carefully hear
[1:17:37] the word that god was delivering to the
[1:17:40] last church age to call a bride out
[1:17:44] when god opens your heart he does it by
[1:17:48] revelation
[1:17:50] hallelujah and if you have ever had a
[1:17:52] revelation from god you got something to
[1:17:55] be thankful for today if he's ever
[1:17:58] revealed himself to you if he's ever
[1:18:00] opened up your heart and anointed your
[1:18:03] eyes with i saved and let you see
[1:18:06] something that you'd never seen before
[1:18:08] you ought to be the one to give him
[1:18:11] praise you ought to be the one to lift
[1:18:13] up your voice clap your hands and say
[1:18:16] lord i want to thank you
[1:18:19] i want to thank you father we thank you
[1:18:22] today
[1:18:23] for revelation
[1:18:25] you have taken your bride from
[1:18:28] intellectual faith to faith by
[1:18:31] revelation
[1:18:33] and what intellectual faith could not
[1:18:35] accomplish in us because it was a mental
[1:18:39] faith it was the origin of our faith
[1:18:42] it's where all faith begins
[1:18:45] all faith begins
[1:18:48] as a concept of the mind
[1:18:50] but when you pour the holy ghost
[1:18:54] on our faith and you reveal it to us
[1:18:58] we are no longer following christ
[1:19:01] because of a mental idea
[1:19:03] we're no longer living this sanctified
[1:19:06] life because of something that we have
[1:19:09] learned intellectually we are now
[1:19:12] following this christ
[1:19:15] we are now reflecting who he is
[1:19:18] because you o god have revealed yourself
[1:19:22] to us
[1:19:23] we may not always live like it we may
[1:19:26] not always worship like it but we want
[1:19:30] to tell you today thank you
[1:19:32] thank you thank you thank you thank you
[1:19:35] thank you thank you lord for revealing
[1:19:39] yourself to us thank you that you're
[1:19:42] you're not finished
[1:19:44] revealing yourself to us but you're
[1:19:47] still unfolding who you are
[1:19:51] before us as you expand our hearts
[1:19:55] oh we thank you now bless our time lord
[1:19:59] jesus together in your word and we will
[1:20:02] give you praise and honor and glory
[1:20:04] for it's in the name of the lord jesus
[1:20:06] christ we pray
[1:20:07] amen and the church said
[1:20:10] amen i'm going to allow you to be seated
[1:20:12] and i'm going to ask for you to stay
[1:20:15] with me as much as you possibly can i
[1:20:18] want you to follow along
[1:20:21] because i believe the lord wants to
[1:20:23] remind us of a few things
[1:20:26] i want our minds to go back a little bit
[1:20:29] as we look at god's word and we remember
[1:20:32] a time
[1:20:33] that when maybe you thought you had it
[1:20:35] all maybe you thought you'd learned it
[1:20:37] all
[1:20:38] we understand that there are believers
[1:20:40] of this message who who feel that way
[1:20:44] they feel like that now that god has
[1:20:47] sent a perfect word they've got it all
[1:20:49] they're just walking in all of it but i
[1:20:52] even read where a minister recently
[1:20:54] posted on social media
[1:20:57] and said i don't understand all these
[1:21:00] people looking for personal revelation
[1:21:03] because god has revealed himself by the
[1:21:05] prophet well i want you to know that
[1:21:08] what god has done and who god has used
[1:21:12] is not good enough for you
[1:21:14] you've got to have
[1:21:16] a a personal unfolding
[1:21:20] a personal unveiling of jesus christ
[1:21:24] there has got to be an apocalypse of
[1:21:26] christ
[1:21:27] in your life
[1:21:29] the veil has to be parted over your life
[1:21:33] and the quickening power has to take
[1:21:36] this word and make it real to you
[1:21:39] because you can't fight the devil with
[1:21:42] william branham's revelation
[1:21:48] you can't beat the devil with shelley's
[1:21:51] revelation
[1:21:54] there's only one revelation you can
[1:21:56] defeat the enemy in your life with and
[1:21:58] that's what god makes real
[1:22:01] to you
[1:22:03] the prophet was so quick to tell us that
[1:22:07] uh any man who stands behind this desk
[1:22:12] should have tasted of the original manna
[1:22:16] for himself
[1:22:19] he said that's why god uh stored it in
[1:22:22] the pot
[1:22:23] in the ark of the covenant and in the in
[1:22:26] the pot of manna that was contained that
[1:22:29] was part of the contents of the ark of
[1:22:31] the covenant along with the table
[1:22:34] tablets tables and with a portion of
[1:22:38] aaron's rod that budded all beautiful
[1:22:42] tokens
[1:22:43] and mementos of god's supernatural power
[1:22:47] supernatural power so the word was
[1:22:50] represented in the ark by the tables of
[1:22:53] stone
[1:22:54] and the supernatural was represented in
[1:22:57] the ark by the pot of manna and by the
[1:22:59] the the rod or the yeah the rod that
[1:23:02] butted in
[1:23:03] almonds i'll get this out
[1:23:08] my tongue is a little twisted but i'll
[1:23:09] get this out
[1:23:11] so both word and spirit
[1:23:15] both truth
[1:23:17] and supernatural vindication was
[1:23:20] represented in the ark of the covenant
[1:23:21] now where's the ark of the covenant now
[1:23:24] i don't mean where is indiana jones
[1:23:27] trying to find the ark of the covenant
[1:23:29] somewhere in the earth i'm talking about
[1:23:32] where is the ark of the covenant it's
[1:23:34] the throne of god and where is the
[1:23:37] throne of god today
[1:23:40] it's in the hearts of men
[1:23:42] this is the throne of god
[1:23:45] this is where god sits
[1:23:47] this is where god dwells he doesn't
[1:23:50] dwell in a building made with hands
[1:23:53] he's not looking for stained glass
[1:23:56] he's not looking for steeples
[1:24:00] because all of those things become a
[1:24:02] part of the babylonian system
[1:24:05] and it's like old grandions
[1:24:08] uh i posted a little song
[1:24:10] on social media yesterday from from my
[1:24:13] friend brother leniel yance who wrote
[1:24:16] this song years ago and
[1:24:18] it was his dream to do a video and he
[1:24:21] even even asked he reached out about
[1:24:24] possibly doing it here in our studio but
[1:24:26] we weren't set up to do anything like
[1:24:28] they were able to do for him in south
[1:24:30] africa and we told him so
[1:24:32] but he traveled to south africa with a
[1:24:35] choir with with the musicians there in
[1:24:38] the church and they made a wonderful
[1:24:40] video as sort of a tribute to his life
[1:24:43] and the songs that he wrote
[1:24:46] and his precious old mother
[1:24:49] who used to play the piano
[1:24:51] and get so happy she would jump up from
[1:24:53] the piano and dance around clapping her
[1:24:56] hands and sit down and just keep right
[1:24:58] on playing she did that many times in
[1:25:01] meetings where i was she wrote that old
[1:25:04] song that i've never forgotten look out
[1:25:07] babylon
[1:25:08] you're getting ready to fall
[1:25:11] look out babylon you're getting your
[1:25:14] last call
[1:25:15] you deceived this nation long enough
[1:25:18] you've built your steeples tall but the
[1:25:21] name of jesus is getting higher
[1:25:26] the name of jesus is getting higher
[1:25:30] and babylon you're getting ready to fall
[1:25:36] hallelujah so he's not dwelling in in
[1:25:39] tabernacles and temples built with the
[1:25:41] hands of men he's building himself he
[1:25:44] has builded himself a home
[1:25:47] in the hearts of men
[1:25:49] and women and he sits here on the ark of
[1:25:52] the covenant and and he represents to us
[1:25:55] both the written truth of god's word and
[1:25:58] the supernatural power that quickens the
[1:26:02] word and makes it alive i don't believe
[1:26:05] you can make the rapture with an
[1:26:08] intellectual concept of the word alone
[1:26:11] i believe you've got to have a
[1:26:13] revelation
[1:26:15] of the word because it's not the written
[1:26:18] word that's going to get us there it's
[1:26:20] the living word
[1:26:22] and the living word is the person of the
[1:26:24] lord jesus christ
[1:26:27] and he hasn't left himself unrepresented
[1:26:30] in the earth
[1:26:31] he's got a bride i wish i had some help
[1:26:34] he's got a bride
[1:26:36] hallelujah
[1:26:37] she is genderless
[1:26:42] she's raceless
[1:26:45] she is a race of her own
[1:26:50] amen doesn't matter if her skin is
[1:26:52] darker or lighter
[1:26:55] there's no race in the bride
[1:26:58] there's no gender in the bride
[1:27:01] now there are offices i have to say this
[1:27:04] for some of my fans
[1:27:09] i say that facetiously
[1:27:11] some of my critics i have to say this
[1:27:13] for them i believe there are certain
[1:27:15] offices in the church for men and men
[1:27:18] only
[1:27:20] but i want you to know in the bride it's
[1:27:22] genderless
[1:27:23] what god wants to do in you
[1:27:25] brothers
[1:27:26] as his bride he wants to do new sisters
[1:27:29] as his bride
[1:27:30] and if if a woman can be a son of god
[1:27:35] then a man can be a part of the bride of
[1:27:37] christ
[1:27:38] it's a paradigm
[1:27:39] [Music]
[1:27:41] and it's not two paradigms
[1:27:44] it's sonship and union
[1:27:48] that's the truth that's going to take us
[1:27:50] out of here
[1:27:51] to be one with christ the living word
[1:27:55] it's not how many quotes you memorize
[1:27:58] it's not how many scripture verses you
[1:28:00] memorize it's not how much of god's
[1:28:02] words you go through
[1:28:04] it's how much of god's word goes through
[1:28:06] you
[1:28:07] because digestive in the spiritual is
[1:28:11] revelation it's god getting down in
[1:28:14] there and making it quicken until listen
[1:28:17] you can preach all day long
[1:28:19] of what god wants to do
[1:28:21] but you let somebody get a revelation he
[1:28:24] wants to do that for me
[1:28:26] it changes the atmosphere
[1:28:31] we can talk all day long about having
[1:28:33] the power of the creative spoken word
[1:28:36] but once you get a revelation
[1:28:41] you see i was told one time in the
[1:28:43] realms of spirit
[1:28:45] that i was born for that purpose
[1:28:48] i was told that the reason of for my
[1:28:51] birth was that i would manifest the
[1:28:54] power of the creative spoken word i'm
[1:28:56] waiting on that
[1:28:58] i know that is my destiny but it is not
[1:29:01] my destiny alone
[1:29:03] it was just the answer to my prayer
[1:29:06] i just prayed god why am i born
[1:29:09] why am i here
[1:29:11] what is the real purpose of my coming
[1:29:14] why what am i supposed to do just preach
[1:29:17] the word
[1:29:18] and he answered me in a very
[1:29:20] supernatural way you were born for the
[1:29:22] purpose of manifesting the creative
[1:29:26] power of the spoken word so i'm looking
[1:29:28] for that
[1:29:29] somebody said how could that come in
[1:29:31] handy well i'll let you figure it out
[1:29:33] all you got to do is look at the five
[1:29:34] examples of the spoken word and the
[1:29:36] ministry of brother branham and you'll
[1:29:38] find out how it could be very handy
[1:29:40] because it gives us authority over the
[1:29:42] elements
[1:29:44] and the power to tell storms to be still
[1:29:48] you just got to make sure that god
[1:29:49] didn't sin the storm that you're trying
[1:29:51] to quiet
[1:29:53] you get among some of the charismatics
[1:29:55] and they get to wanting to stop every
[1:29:56] storm you've got to understand i know
[1:29:59] the master of the wind
[1:30:01] i know nahum said he's the god of the
[1:30:04] whirlwind
[1:30:05] and sometimes we find ourselves trying
[1:30:08] to pray off of somebody brother steve
[1:30:10] what god has placed on them
[1:30:14] and you know that's antichrist
[1:30:18] that's moving in a wrong spirit
[1:30:20] if god is calling someone to repentance
[1:30:22] you don't need to be there trying to
[1:30:24] pray their way easier
[1:30:26] you need to be there praying get them
[1:30:28] lord
[1:30:30] however you need whatever you however
[1:30:32] you plan you would you just be sovereign
[1:30:36] in their life
[1:30:37] i want you to know i don't believe that
[1:30:39] god has to let somebody be in a car
[1:30:41] accident
[1:30:43] or that god has to put somebody in the
[1:30:45] hospital to save them i don't believe
[1:30:46] that i believe god can do that by one
[1:30:50] second one flash
[1:30:52] of his unction can come down and change
[1:30:55] a person's mind and cause them
[1:30:57] immediately to see their need for christ
[1:31:00] they're going along living for the world
[1:31:02] and for themselves don't even know they
[1:31:04] need god don't even know they need a
[1:31:06] savior and all of a sud
[1:31:09] and i've used the example of sister
[1:31:11] hattie wright's children that's exactly
[1:31:13] what happened to them there they are
[1:31:15] mocking the very god that manifested
[1:31:17] himself to bring them to salvation
[1:31:19] they're blocking
[1:31:20] laughing at the silliness of this story
[1:31:23] and all of a sudden god comes down
[1:31:26] the unction of god comes down and the
[1:31:29] word of the lord to the prophet give her
[1:31:31] what she wants
[1:31:35] brother branham said she could have
[1:31:36] asked for a million dollars one time 10
[1:31:38] million dollars and it would have
[1:31:40] dropped out of the ceiling into her lap
[1:31:52] i don't want to be you
[1:31:54] i want to be the person that says sure
[1:31:56] he can
[1:31:57] sure god can
[1:31:59] whatever he wants to do he can do it
[1:32:06] i read yesterday where brother manhattan
[1:32:08] said
[1:32:09] that he could move and it didn't even
[1:32:11] have to be written in the word what he
[1:32:12] could do
[1:32:16] that's powerful isn't it
[1:32:18] he is the word
[1:32:23] he's not going to do anything contrary
[1:32:25] to his word
[1:32:26] but he may do something he's never done
[1:32:28] before
[1:32:29] oh i hear him
[1:32:33] nothing new under the sun i hear him now
[1:32:37] look brother sister this fight is not a
[1:32:39] new fight
[1:32:41] it's an old fight
[1:32:43] because once god opens your heart like
[1:32:46] he did lydia
[1:32:48] you are not satisfied with the peace of
[1:32:51] the word
[1:32:53] you are not satisfied with a dead dry
[1:32:57] discourse of a historical god
[1:33:01] you want to see a god who's just as real
[1:33:05] today
[1:33:06] as he ever was jesus christ the same
[1:33:10] yesterday and today and forever
[1:33:14] right down in the nitty gritties
[1:33:17] are you with me
[1:33:18] i'm okay i didn't fall
[1:33:21] i will survive
[1:33:23] thank you for checking
[1:33:26] the lord opened her heart
[1:33:29] she was already a god fearer
[1:33:31] she already worshiped the god of israel
[1:33:35] and now as she sits under the words of
[1:33:38] the apostle paul
[1:33:40] something begins to burn
[1:33:42] in her
[1:33:43] and she says
[1:33:45] he's not like oral roberts
[1:33:52] he's not like billy graham
[1:33:56] he's not like w.v grant
[1:34:00] he's not like tommy osborne
[1:34:05] he's not like oh ja oil jaggers
[1:34:10] he's not like gordon lindsay
[1:34:13] there's something
[1:34:14] that happens to me when that
[1:34:17] brother paul
[1:34:18] preaches
[1:34:21] my heart expands
[1:34:27] give me the verse about enlargement of
[1:34:28] the heart would you psalm
[1:34:30] in the psalm where god talks about
[1:34:34] the heart being enlarged and i will run
[1:34:36] the way of thy commandments
[1:34:38] can we find that someone can call it out
[1:34:40] if you find it there
[1:34:43] it's in large heart it might not be
[1:34:45] enlarging the king james i can't
[1:34:47] remember but would you find that for me
[1:34:49] or are you in a real hurry good
[1:34:54] i want to take my time
[1:34:57] hallelujah
[1:34:58] psalm 1
[1:35:00] psalm 1 psalm 119 verse 32 can you pull
[1:35:04] that one or is that going to throw you
[1:35:06] off
[1:35:07] 119 32 i will
[1:35:10] run the way of thy commandments
[1:35:14] when thou shalt
[1:35:16] enlarge
[1:35:18] my heart
[1:35:19] that's what happened to lydia her heart
[1:35:21] expanded
[1:35:23] her heart was opened up and she said
[1:35:26] well nobody ever talked about him like
[1:35:28] paul talked about him
[1:35:31] he made christ
[1:35:34] live
[1:35:36] when i heard this prophet
[1:35:38] i said he preaches as though he knew him
[1:35:44] he talks like one who walked with him
[1:35:48] and slept with him and and ministered
[1:35:51] with him it so struck me do you have
[1:35:53] that in another version there
[1:35:58] i
[1:36:00] will not merely walk
[1:36:02] but run the way
[1:36:05] of your commandments
[1:36:07] when you give me a heart
[1:36:10] that is willing
[1:36:12] the heart
[1:36:14] that is expanded is a heart
[1:36:17] that is willing
[1:36:19] no
[1:36:20] price i want you to stay with me now
[1:36:23] no price is too great
[1:36:26] when god opens your heart to the word
[1:36:30] let me say it again
[1:36:32] when god opens your heart to the word no
[1:36:35] price
[1:36:37] no requirement
[1:36:39] no standard
[1:36:41] no sacrifice
[1:36:43] is too much for you to give
[1:36:47] i worry about the vanity of this bride
[1:36:52] anybody with me
[1:36:54] i worry about the vanity of this bride
[1:36:57] i see coming to pass
[1:36:59] the ministry the sermon that i preached
[1:37:02] so many years ago i see it coming to
[1:37:04] pass
[1:37:05] in this hour the holy ghost of god
[1:37:08] was so grieved in in my heart uh
[1:37:12] last night through the night
[1:37:15] i
[1:37:18] i never slept deep
[1:37:22] because every time i started
[1:37:25] feeling a deep sleep i could feel a moan
[1:37:28] and a groan way
[1:37:31] down
[1:37:32] in my
[1:37:34] in my
[1:37:37] neither regions
[1:37:39] the inside of the inside i could hear
[1:37:42] the holy ghost going oh
[1:37:48] oh
[1:37:50] somebody said i i that sounds so crazy
[1:37:53] to me i don't know why it does
[1:37:55] because the bible said when we know not
[1:37:57] how to pray for as we all he the spirit
[1:37:59] will make intercession for us with
[1:38:01] groanings that cannot be uttered
[1:38:05] why is that so strange to you
[1:38:07] and i heard the holy ghost moaning all
[1:38:10] night long and i knew even a portion of
[1:38:13] why he was moaning he was moaning for
[1:38:16] those that have opened their hearts to
[1:38:19] the world
[1:38:24] because this is not an hour for the
[1:38:26] bride to be opening her heart to the
[1:38:29] world
[1:38:30] [Music]
[1:38:31] this is the hour for the bride to be
[1:38:34] opening her heart more and more and more
[1:38:36] and more and more and more
[1:38:38] to the world
[1:38:41] when you see the bride running after
[1:38:44] what the world
[1:38:46] is running after
[1:38:48] you can know that somewhere the holy
[1:38:50] ghost is groaning
[1:38:52] and grieving
[1:38:54] because this holy ghost is
[1:38:56] is desiring to bring us to the full
[1:38:58] manifestation of the stature of christ
[1:39:01] and by opening our heart to the world we
[1:39:05] contaminate the message of truth
[1:39:09] we contaminate the message of the
[1:39:11] revelation of jesus christ
[1:39:14] you remember charities baby doll
[1:39:20] the spirit of god has me to
[1:39:23] revisit that sometime
[1:39:25] three chairs on the platform
[1:39:28] i believe it was paul and brother west
[1:39:30] and the baby doll
[1:39:32] three representing three generations
[1:39:36] you see that what one
[1:39:38] generation devalues
[1:39:42] the next generation
[1:39:44] embraces
[1:39:50] compromise
[1:39:52] starts setting in
[1:39:54] when a value is no longer placed
[1:39:57] on the things that are valuable when you
[1:39:59] see the bride running after the things
[1:40:02] of the world
[1:40:04] wanting to be more elaborate and more
[1:40:06] more sophisticated help me now
[1:40:11] wanting to live above the look the bible
[1:40:13] tells a sister that she is to to desire
[1:40:17] to be shame-faced before god
[1:40:22] right
[1:40:23] and that her adornment is not to be the
[1:40:26] outward adorning
[1:40:27] of the planting of the hair the wearing
[1:40:29] of golden pearls
[1:40:31] and silver
[1:40:33] these things of the world her desire
[1:40:36] is to be toward her bridegroom
[1:40:40] and how she might be able to reflect his
[1:40:43] love and character to a world that's
[1:40:46] dying
[1:40:47] but every time you see a generation
[1:40:49] going farther and farther and farther to
[1:40:52] embrace the things of the world reaching
[1:40:54] for the diamonds
[1:40:57] reaching for the shiny things
[1:41:00] you read it you hear the message
[1:41:02] you know i got a shock
[1:41:05] a couple weeks ago i think it was sunday
[1:41:08] today was two weeks ago
[1:41:10] a friend of mine brother green's
[1:41:12] grandson is a friend of mine
[1:41:15] and he sent me a quote
[1:41:17] because he's digging in these days
[1:41:20] and he sent me a quote
[1:41:22] and i had just read part of it the night
[1:41:24] before
[1:41:25] where brother branham talks about the
[1:41:27] difference between
[1:41:28] shining
[1:41:31] and glowing
[1:41:33] the world is shiny
[1:41:38] the world likes the shiny things
[1:41:41] the character of this world is to like
[1:41:44] the glitz and glamour of this world it's
[1:41:47] all very attractive and we get blinded
[1:41:50] sometime by the by the lights of
[1:41:52] hollywood you don't have to say amen
[1:41:57] you don't change the truth by your
[1:41:59] silence
[1:42:01] it's still the truth
[1:42:03] we we get star gazed
[1:42:06] i've seen it happen to my own children
[1:42:08] where they look at these ball players
[1:42:12] like there's something to look at
[1:42:14] i want you to know very few of them are
[1:42:16] anything to look at
[1:42:20] they're not heroes
[1:42:22] i don't care how many home runs they hit
[1:42:25] and how many bases they steal
[1:42:28] if they don't treat their wives right
[1:42:30] when they get home they're not a hero of
[1:42:32] mine
[1:42:34] i don't care how many maseratis they
[1:42:36] drive if they don't serve jesus christ
[1:42:39] and make him lord of their life and
[1:42:41] honor god's word above their own desire
[1:42:44] i'm not following in that and i'm not
[1:42:46] going to be blinded by their stardom
[1:42:51] i happen to know
[1:42:53] i happen to know that one of the
[1:42:55] all-time
[1:42:56] and i'm not going to call the name some
[1:42:58] of you know the name but i'm not going
[1:43:00] to call the name but a friend of mine
[1:43:03] has been ministering
[1:43:05] to a real
[1:43:06] movie star
[1:43:11] unbelievable opportunity to speak life
[1:43:16] into a real
[1:43:17] movie star one that has won the awards
[1:43:21] and has captured the affections of women
[1:43:25] for years
[1:43:28] still
[1:43:28] today
[1:43:30] women are enamored by him
[1:43:33] and when you boil him down and use all
[1:43:36] of his money is laid on the shelf
[1:43:39] he desires the same thing this is god's
[1:43:42] grace to that man
[1:43:43] he desires the same thing that those
[1:43:46] that the rest of us do and that is to
[1:43:48] have peace
[1:43:52] he had an assembly of god influence in
[1:43:54] his life and he desires to go back to
[1:43:58] that church experience
[1:44:01] whoa that he knew let me tell you
[1:44:03] something his his beauty
[1:44:07] has not satisfied
[1:44:11] his picture on the front of the magazine
[1:44:14] has not satisfied the trophies on his
[1:44:17] shelf have not satisfied the the
[1:44:20] mansions
[1:44:22] that he owns have not satisfied way
[1:44:26] down on the inside of the inside he
[1:44:29] opened up his life and became vulnerable
[1:44:32] to a friend of ours
[1:44:34] and and said and even it was even in an
[1:44:36] interview
[1:44:38] out there in the public
[1:44:40] that he was looking for his roots
[1:44:43] what i'm telling you folks is we often
[1:44:45] get caught up with what the world gets
[1:44:48] caught up with
[1:44:51] and one more generation i heard brother
[1:44:53] greeley say something here and i don't
[1:44:55] know if you amend him or not but i did
[1:44:58] he said i don't think we ought to be
[1:44:59] looking like the upc church and i agree
[1:45:02] 100
[1:45:04] because they some of those folks want to
[1:45:06] make sure they don't show their elbow
[1:45:08] but they walk around on them stilts
[1:45:12] out of balance
[1:45:15] just out of balance
[1:45:17] looking for a way to get along in this
[1:45:20] whole world what you and i better be
[1:45:22] looking for is a way to get in that word
[1:45:25] and let that word remake and reshape us
[1:45:28] into the image of jesus christ we better
[1:45:32] get our eyes off the glitz and the
[1:45:33] glamour and the shiny things
[1:45:39] somebody's going to help me
[1:45:41] i know they are somebody's going to help
[1:45:43] me
[1:45:44] because if we don't your children that
[1:45:47] are unborn
[1:45:48] your children that are unborn they will
[1:45:51] not have the godly influence and example
[1:46:00] you let granddaddy compromise
[1:46:03] and look what daddy ends up doing
[1:46:06] and then the third baby doll we just put
[1:46:08] a baby doll in there
[1:46:10] then it becomes and we can show it right
[1:46:13] in the scripture it went from fearing
[1:46:15] god about everything and walking before
[1:46:17] him in holiness it developed into a
[1:46:20] generation that everything was right
[1:46:21] they did what was right in their own
[1:46:23] eyes i'm telling you church we are
[1:46:25] living in the hour right now where
[1:46:27] everybody's doing what is right in their
[1:46:30] own eyes and very few are considering
[1:46:33] thus saith the lord
[1:46:36] somebody better wake up and that
[1:46:38] somebody's you and i we better wake up
[1:46:42] because what we've got they need
[1:46:45] and it's up to us to hold the line
[1:46:48] [Music]
[1:46:52] it's up to us i remember when god opened
[1:46:55] my heart
[1:46:56] i remember when he made me want to pay
[1:46:59] attention to what the last church age
[1:47:01] messenger was saying
[1:47:03] and it cost me something
[1:47:05] it cost me something i was preaching
[1:47:08] every day of the week on the radio and
[1:47:10] it cost me something i was preaching
[1:47:13] every saturday on the streets of
[1:47:15] anderson south carolina and it cost me
[1:47:17] something when i heard that messenger
[1:47:19] preach
[1:47:21] because i made up my mind i could never
[1:47:23] go back and do it my way
[1:47:25] i could never go back and do it how i
[1:47:28] had done it before i now had to make
[1:47:30] sure that i lined up with the word of
[1:47:33] god i thought i had it all i thought i
[1:47:36] knew it all and then god enlarged my
[1:47:39] heart
[1:47:41] you've heard paul keith when he did his
[1:47:44] series here on secretariat
[1:47:47] and if you come in my office you'll see
[1:47:50] some some plates of secretariat the
[1:47:53] horse
[1:47:54] i'm fascinated by
[1:47:56] i've got a little doll back there
[1:47:58] of secretariat
[1:48:00] that that uh the owner of secretariat
[1:48:03] and the trainer of secretariat signed
[1:48:06] the tag and i i enjoyed some of those
[1:48:10] things in in the day
[1:48:12] and you saw that triple crown winner and
[1:48:14] we don't have time to go through all
[1:48:16] that and when secretariat died you heard
[1:48:19] it told here that they did an autopsy on
[1:48:21] his body because there never had been a
[1:48:24] horse like that horse
[1:48:26] to this day not a horse quite like
[1:48:30] secretariat
[1:48:32] and they wanted to know how
[1:48:34] he was not favored to be what he was
[1:48:38] he was not predicted to be what he was
[1:48:41] but his creator
[1:48:44] had cheated a little bit on him
[1:48:48] his creator had given him an anomaly
[1:48:52] the heart
[1:48:54] larger than any horse heart that had
[1:48:56] ever been examined by man
[1:48:58] lord larger chambers
[1:49:01] pumping more blood
[1:49:04] giving more energy to run
[1:49:06] and stamina to stay the course
[1:49:09] and then you look at that scripture i
[1:49:11] will run the way
[1:49:13] of thy commandments for thou hast
[1:49:16] enlarged
[1:49:18] my heart
[1:49:19] let god enlarge your heart
[1:49:23] toe the line
[1:49:25] hold the landmark don't allow the glitz
[1:49:29] and glitter of this world to distract
[1:49:32] you in this hour is not
[1:49:35] worth it
[1:49:38] you see brother branham told them he
[1:49:39] said now i guess if
[1:49:41] you know your husband or
[1:49:43] your daddy or something give you a
[1:49:45] little
[1:49:46] chain and
[1:49:48] i i
[1:49:50] hear him
[1:49:52] i guess that would be all right to wear
[1:49:54] the problem with such a thing is this
[1:49:57] is the nature of the beast
[1:49:59] [Music]
[1:50:00] it's what i'm preaching
[1:50:02] if you've been amen and don't stop now
[1:50:04] if you've not been amen and you ought to
[1:50:06] start now
[1:50:08] it's just the nature of the beast
[1:50:10] because there's something
[1:50:12] when you go after that you feed
[1:50:13] something
[1:50:15] in your base nature
[1:50:18] you begin to be more concerned about
[1:50:20] your appearance
[1:50:23] you begin to be more concerned about
[1:50:24] drawing attention and attraction and so
[1:50:27] forth and the next thing you know you'll
[1:50:28] look like some of these message people
[1:50:30] today
[1:50:31] they look like clowns
[1:50:35] i'm going to be honest they look like
[1:50:36] clowns they don't no more just a little
[1:50:39] single chain but these big old dime
[1:50:41] store bubbles they wear
[1:50:44] it is the truth brother it institute and
[1:50:47] where did it start a quote
[1:50:51] some of them came out of holiness some
[1:50:53] of them knew better
[1:50:54] than to have those things
[1:50:57] but they picked that up because they had
[1:50:59] a quote for him
[1:51:00] i guess if you didn't have any
[1:51:02] fingernails he said you could put you
[1:51:03] some on
[1:51:04] that's a dangerous thing to say
[1:51:09] because that don't mean you chew them
[1:51:11] off so you can glue them on
[1:51:14] i'm just preaching holiness
[1:51:16] i know some of you probably never heard
[1:51:17] it in your
[1:51:18] life i'm just preaching the way it was
[1:51:21] preached to me
[1:51:22] seems to have worked
[1:51:24] you don't chew them off
[1:51:26] so you can
[1:51:27] glue them on
[1:51:30] look like a witch
[1:51:32] i see it and and and is it in itself sin
[1:51:36] he he said you didn't have any glumon so
[1:51:38] it must not be
[1:51:41] but that's feeding the nature of a beast
[1:51:44] and the next thing you know you got to
[1:51:45] have more you got to do more and you got
[1:51:46] to do this you got to do that and you
[1:51:48] got to pedicure that and manicure this
[1:51:50] poor old brother branham i love to hear
[1:51:52] him talk about how they how they
[1:51:53] manicured their eyes
[1:51:58] that's how much he knew about it he
[1:52:00] thought a manicure was something they
[1:52:01] did to their eye
[1:52:04] you know the bible is specific about
[1:52:06] that stuff
[1:52:07] when it talks about ahab's wife
[1:52:10] i'm not i'm not even gonna call her name
[1:52:15] i'm not even going to celebrate her name
[1:52:17] you know her name
[1:52:18] the bible specifically says she painted
[1:52:20] her eyes
[1:52:21] [Music]
[1:52:23] bible specifically says it
[1:52:26] didn't talk about her rouge
[1:52:28] uh
[1:52:29] foundation
[1:52:30] or all that specifically talks about her
[1:52:32] pain around she did that to be
[1:52:33] attractive
[1:52:34] she did that because she thought she
[1:52:36] would catch the attention of the prophet
[1:52:38] and that he would compromise
[1:52:42] that her beauty would strike him
[1:52:45] and he would compromise and only
[1:52:47] prophesy good things to ahab her husband
[1:52:50] whoa
[1:52:51] she didn't know the prophet that god had
[1:52:53] sent her brother branham said she didn't
[1:52:56] know that elijah was her pastor
[1:53:02] she never attended whoa i'm preaching
[1:53:05] now
[1:53:06] hallelujah
[1:53:11] i'm not on off of page one
[1:53:14] this ain't in my notes
[1:53:15] this is just fun
[1:53:19] we're talking about mrs dogmeat
[1:53:27] the queen of the land became food for
[1:53:30] the dogs
[1:53:32] because she thought her beauty if she
[1:53:34] manicured this and fixed that and and
[1:53:37] sucked that out
[1:53:39] and pumped that up
[1:53:43] she thought if she'd stole her botulism
[1:53:46] from the buzzards
[1:53:48] and inserted that into every crack and
[1:53:50] crevice
[1:53:51] that she would be able to present
[1:53:52] herself in such a way that the prophet
[1:53:55] would be
[1:53:56] enamored and attracted maybe she had no
[1:53:59] hope of sleeping with the prophet but
[1:54:02] she certainly wanted to water down his
[1:54:04] message
[1:54:08] she wanted to devalue the truth that he
[1:54:10] had stood for by the way she twisted
[1:54:12] herself around
[1:54:14] whoa
[1:54:15] but i want you to know
[1:54:17] god has a way it wasn't it
[1:54:19] she didn't just fall on her own out the
[1:54:21] window
[1:54:24] her own servants threw her down
[1:54:26] the eunuchs that had been trained to
[1:54:29] serve her
[1:54:30] perhaps the same ones that helped her
[1:54:32] curl her eyelashes
[1:54:37] we're the ones a prophet said throw her
[1:54:38] down
[1:54:44] you just don't get by god
[1:54:47] she never attended a service
[1:54:50] in elijah's church
[1:54:53] but the prophet said he was her pastor
[1:54:57] and she didn't even know it
[1:54:59] and god was going to hold her
[1:55:01] responsible for every word that he had
[1:55:04] preached down at the church that she had
[1:55:07] never attended
[1:55:09] because when god appoints a voice to a
[1:55:12] place
[1:55:14] that place is responsible to that voice
[1:55:18] that was not just for the bible days
[1:55:20] that is also appropriate and he carries
[1:55:23] it into our modern day and he said the
[1:55:25] same thing about the hour we're living
[1:55:27] in right now
[1:55:30] i saw where brother daniel i believe
[1:55:33] posted a quote about the kind old priest
[1:55:35] that's what they're looking for
[1:55:37] that's what they want for a pastor they
[1:55:38] want a kind of priest who will turn his
[1:55:41] eyes to everything and say nothing about
[1:55:43] anything
[1:55:46] as long as they have watermelon cuttings
[1:55:48] and soup suppers to supplement his
[1:55:50] salary
[1:55:52] they just want a condo priest to kiss
[1:55:54] their babies
[1:55:55] bury their dead and marry their children
[1:55:57] come on now
[1:55:59] they don't want somebody to come back
[1:56:01] and say hey
[1:56:03] get back to the landmark
[1:56:05] don't let these things slide
[1:56:08] [Applause]
[1:56:10] what was that brother greeley said
[1:56:11] tuesday night i'm just priming the pump
[1:56:13] for our pastor
[1:56:18] god
[1:56:20] opening our hearts
[1:56:22] for the word
[1:56:24] what do you think's gonna what do you
[1:56:26] think is gonna perfect this bride what
[1:56:28] do you think is going to move us into
[1:56:29] the last move of god and i want you to
[1:56:31] know i don't care what they say i don't
[1:56:33] care what they preach i want you to know
[1:56:35] there's one more blaze of god's glorious
[1:56:39] power that's going to surge through his
[1:56:41] bride on planet earth
[1:56:44] you've never seen god's glory
[1:56:47] somebody said how could you say that
[1:56:49] i can say it because i understand the
[1:56:52] law of sowing and reaping
[1:56:55] and i understand that one servant had to
[1:56:58] reach maturity and die
[1:57:03] so that 120 could come back on the day
[1:57:05] of pentecost
[1:57:06] i realized that just a generation ago
[1:57:09] one servant
[1:57:11] had to come to maturity and die
[1:57:13] so that a last-day bride could move into
[1:57:16] a quick short
[1:57:18] work
[1:57:21] not a church revival a rock bride's
[1:57:26] revival
[1:57:27] and though they preach sunday after
[1:57:28] sunday after sunday that we know the
[1:57:30] thunders we know the thunders we know
[1:57:32] the thunders i'm here telling you today
[1:57:35] exactly what he said the bride third
[1:57:37] seal bride has never had a revival yet
[1:57:40] it will take the revelation of those
[1:57:42] unknown thunders
[1:57:46] so we're waiting on something
[1:57:49] and we're not going to get it by opening
[1:57:52] up our hearts
[1:57:54] to the world
[1:57:55] [Applause]
[1:57:57] only when we open our heart to the word
[1:58:00] somebody said thank you for your help
[1:58:02] brother austin somebody said uh
[1:58:05] i thought you were on a series god's
[1:58:07] word
[1:58:08] calls for total separation or total
[1:58:11] separation is a prerequisite
[1:58:14] total deliverance
[1:58:15] requires
[1:58:17] total separation i thought you
[1:58:18] understand i am i'm still on the series
[1:58:21] i'm talking now about the difference
[1:58:23] between a mental and intellectual
[1:58:25] concept of faith
[1:58:26] and a revelation
[1:58:28] and once it becomes a revelation to you
[1:58:30] you'll never be talked out of it
[1:58:34] well i'm so glad some of that stuff
[1:58:36] never became a revelation to some of
[1:58:38] y'all
[1:58:40] it just became a learned doctrine
[1:58:42] so that when god comes along with truth
[1:58:44] and begins to open up your heart and let
[1:58:46] you see all you have to do is step out
[1:58:48] of error
[1:58:52] step right into the truth
[1:58:53] indoctrination is a plot of the enemy
[1:58:56] and there's just as much indoctrination
[1:58:58] around this message as there is any
[1:59:00] denominational system out there in the
[1:59:02] world that's how the enemy operates he's
[1:59:05] more concerned about what goes on around
[1:59:06] this message than he is what goes on in
[1:59:08] denominational circles because this
[1:59:11] message is what god sent to produce a
[1:59:12] bride and cause a rapture
[1:59:17] i think if god was going to focus on
[1:59:19] something he's way more concerned with
[1:59:21] what's happening around the little bride
[1:59:22] of christ wherever she is gathered to
[1:59:24] worship this morning around the world
[1:59:26] then she is keeping up with what's going
[1:59:28] on in the trends
[1:59:29] and the barna researcher questionnaires
[1:59:32] they pass out to find out trends and
[1:59:34] things you don't want you don't want to
[1:59:35] read the trends you don't want to read
[1:59:36] what's going on in the church
[1:59:40] you don't want to read those statistics
[1:59:43] less and less people are believing in a
[1:59:45] virgin birth
[1:59:48] a major charismatic leader came out this
[1:59:51] week and said it's no god no longer
[1:59:52] requires someone to pay their tithe
[1:59:56] so social media is blowing up
[1:59:59] i have an answer i wasn't even going to
[2:00:00] mention it because i don't even think
[2:00:01] that what they're doing out there is
[2:00:02] even really worthy of talking about in
[2:00:04] here
[2:00:05] i wasn't going to mention their
[2:00:06] foolishness but i think i will
[2:00:10] because they said well that's under the
[2:00:11] law and we're no longer under the law if
[2:00:12] you're going to have the law you've got
[2:00:14] to have all the law so probably paying
[2:00:15] tithe is under the law and so it's
[2:00:17] really not necessary to pay tithe of
[2:00:18] course we all know in here that paying
[2:00:21] tithe predates the law
[2:00:25] we all know that god required abraham
[2:00:30] to pay ties to melchizedek
[2:00:32] before there ever was a law
[2:00:34] and i got news for you those ties were
[2:00:36] more than ten percent
[2:00:38] because the amount had never been fixed
[2:00:40] and so now they're saying we so the
[2:00:42] church don't have to be worried about
[2:00:43] things like that i want you to know
[2:00:45] something if you don't give god what
[2:00:46] belongs to him you're a thief and a
[2:00:48] robber
[2:00:51] so all your shaking and quaking ain't
[2:00:53] going to get you nowhere
[2:00:55] [Music]
[2:00:57] it's the truth anyhow
[2:00:59] but but let me tell you what the new i
[2:01:00] love preaching this
[2:01:02] all right you don't believe in giving
[2:01:04] god 10 of your little measly 10 of your
[2:01:06] income fine you you say you want to do
[2:01:09] it the new testament way fine
[2:01:14] bring it all
[2:01:19] the book of acts said they sold
[2:01:20] everything they had and came and laid
[2:01:22] the money at the apostles feet
[2:01:23] come on let's do it
[2:01:27] you'll be so glad to go back and pay
[2:01:29] your little 10 percent
[2:01:32] ain't god got a good sense of humor
[2:01:34] and god must have taken it more serious
[2:01:37] than people take it today
[2:01:39] because ananias and sapphira they kept
[2:01:42] that comportion
[2:01:44] of their money
[2:01:49] they kept that comportion of their money
[2:01:53] and ended up giving their life for it
[2:01:55] because they lied to the holy ghost
[2:01:59] don't try to deceive the holy ghost
[2:02:03] i'm gonna close after a while don't lie
[2:02:05] don't think you can get by you may lie
[2:02:08] to the preacher you may lie to your
[2:02:09] parents
[2:02:10] you may lie to your fiance
[2:02:13] you may lie to your neighbor but don't
[2:02:16] you ever think you'll get by lying to
[2:02:18] the holy ghost
[2:02:20] because ananias and sapphire now if you
[2:02:22] take that to the message of the hour
[2:02:24] you'll find out that the prophet talks
[2:02:25] about an hour when that kind of the fear
[2:02:27] of the lord will return to the bride
[2:02:30] and he said and there will be ananias
[2:02:32] and sapphira's laying around and a few
[2:02:34] of them
[2:02:37] that's a quote
[2:02:39] and a few of them
[2:02:40] we're talking about a surge of god's
[2:02:43] holy ghost power where there will still
[2:02:45] be those who try to lie to the holy
[2:02:47] ghost
[2:02:51] and the same ones that carry the husband
[2:02:52] out of care of the wife same ones carry
[2:02:54] the wife will carry the husband out
[2:02:56] we're looking for a return
[2:02:58] of everything the word promised in the
[2:03:01] book of acts and the prophet of god has
[2:03:04] told us that if this vine ever puts
[2:03:07] forth another branch
[2:03:10] it must be exactly like the original
[2:03:14] same signs same wonders same miracles
[2:03:18] same power of god
[2:03:20] and i'm one who believes it will
[2:03:24] it won't be another book of the acts of
[2:03:26] the apostles it'll be another book of
[2:03:28] the acts of the holy ghost
[2:03:30] the holy spirit you're going to see some
[2:03:31] things
[2:03:33] you're going to see some things let me
[2:03:34] let me help you quicken it would you
[2:03:36] like to you know hasten it a little bit
[2:03:38] let me tell you how close your heart
[2:03:41] to the things of this world
[2:03:43] make up your mind if everybody mocks you
[2:03:46] when i received this message i told you
[2:03:48] a few moments ago my friends that would
[2:03:51] support me on the streets crossed over
[2:03:53] to the other side of the street when
[2:03:55] they saw me coming i had preached
[2:03:57] revivals for them they had preached
[2:03:59] revivals for me but when they heard that
[2:04:01] i had accepted this truth i'm walking
[2:04:03] down the down main street of anderson
[2:04:05] south carolina to get to my place to
[2:04:07] preach that saturday meet my guitar
[2:04:09] player down there to preach and on my
[2:04:12] way my very good friend one who had
[2:04:14] really been the best friend i'd had
[2:04:16] while i was in south carolina crossed
[2:04:18] the street and i started to say you're a
[2:04:20] jaywalker
[2:04:24] he didn't even wait till he got to the
[2:04:25] crosswalk he saw me coming and he just
[2:04:27] crossed over to the other side of the
[2:04:29] street he didn't even want to walk on
[2:04:30] the same side of the street with me you
[2:04:32] know what that's a reproach for the word
[2:04:34] i'm willing to bear that again and again
[2:04:36] and again and again and again
[2:04:38] somebody said but i don't understand
[2:04:40] that it is not required
[2:04:43] that you understand
[2:04:46] it is required of this bride that we
[2:04:49] obey the word
[2:04:56] i'm going to stay off of that
[2:05:00] john 15 26 anybody still here
[2:05:03] whoa let's see if i'm getting any amen
[2:05:08] oh yeah i'm getting some help here
[2:05:10] thank god thank god thank god thank god
[2:05:13] thank god
[2:05:15] yes i'm getting some help here too
[2:05:17] praise the lord but when the comforter
[2:05:19] is come
[2:05:21] whom i will send you from the father
[2:05:22] even the spirit of truth
[2:05:26] which proceedeth from the father he
[2:05:28] shall what
[2:05:31] he shall testify of
[2:05:36] me
[2:05:36] the amplified said he will testify
[2:05:38] regarding me
[2:05:41] if the holy ghost shows up
[2:05:43] he's going to brag about jesus
[2:05:48] he's not looking for any glory because
[2:05:51] he understands this holy ghost you know
[2:05:54] we get it all kind of confused sometimes
[2:05:56] we've talked about it here we like to
[2:05:58] say it
[2:06:00] but the holy ghost is not it
[2:06:04] it's he
[2:06:06] the same spirit
[2:06:08] i will pray the father and he will send
[2:06:10] you another comforter i will not leave
[2:06:12] you comfortless i will come to you and
[2:06:15] what is it that the holy ghost comes to
[2:06:17] do to bring the spirit of truth
[2:06:20] to bring revelation
[2:06:22] not just information
[2:06:25] how many of you are hungry
[2:06:27] for
[2:06:28] revelation in your own personal life
[2:06:33] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[2:06:35] hallelujah i want to give you this quote
[2:06:38] from the anointed ones at the end time
[2:06:39] are you ready
[2:06:41] paragraph 53 we read this when we were
[2:06:43] here
[2:06:44] two weeks ago
[2:06:46] what is faith
[2:07:03] hallelujah
[2:07:05] all the way back to the beginning of
[2:07:07] those notes
[2:07:09] what is
[2:07:10] faith
[2:07:12] faith
[2:07:14] is something that's
[2:07:20] revealed to you
[2:07:21] i heard this message preacher saying
[2:07:23] right on social media
[2:07:25] god has revealed everything he's ever
[2:07:27] going to reveal he did it to the prophet
[2:07:28] and those of you who are waiting on
[2:07:30] personal revelation you're wasting your
[2:07:32] time
[2:07:35] i said that's about the saddest thing
[2:07:36] i've ever read
[2:07:38] because you're not going to be you're
[2:07:40] not going to be held accountable for
[2:07:41] what god revealed to brother branham
[2:07:43] you're going to be held accountable for
[2:07:44] what god revealed to you
[2:07:46] and of course i i don't want you to
[2:07:48] misunderstand what i'm saying about this
[2:07:49] message
[2:07:52] it's truth it is our truth
[2:07:55] but the holy ghost has come to make that
[2:07:58] truth alive
[2:08:00] for you
[2:08:01] it's you're not going to get something
[2:08:03] contrary to the message
[2:08:04] you're not going to get some revelation
[2:08:06] contrary to the word
[2:08:08] we have an absolute
[2:08:15] but if faith is something that's
[2:08:16] revealed to you you can't please god
[2:08:19] without faith
[2:08:21] then you can't please god without a
[2:08:22] revelation
[2:08:25] because faith is something that's
[2:08:26] revealed to you that is not yet
[2:08:28] but you believe it will be faith is a
[2:08:31] revelation of the will of god
[2:08:33] so by
[2:08:34] revelation
[2:08:36] he said in the churches today don't even
[2:08:38] believe in spiritual revelation
[2:08:41] i notice that some make an exception
[2:08:44] for their pastor
[2:08:46] they believe in the dogmatic teaching of
[2:08:48] some system
[2:08:50] by revelation abel offered unto god a
[2:08:53] more excellent sacrifice than that of
[2:08:55] cain which god testified he was
[2:08:58] righteous and we covered that
[2:09:00] he said i hope you see that see where
[2:09:03] we're living see they are i was talking
[2:09:05] to a gentleman not long ago a christian
[2:09:07] scholar and gentleman and he said mr
[2:09:09] branham
[2:09:14] we refuse all
[2:09:16] revelations
[2:09:18] i said then you have to refuse jesus
[2:09:20] christ
[2:09:22] for he is the revelation of god
[2:09:24] god revealed in human flesh unless you
[2:09:27] see it unless you see it
[2:09:30] unless you see it
[2:09:32] let me ask you a question does it matter
[2:09:33] if we know who jesus is or not
[2:09:36] it must
[2:09:38] i pray for those who believe he's the
[2:09:40] second person of a trinity
[2:09:42] i pray for them
[2:09:44] because they don't know who he is
[2:09:48] unless you see who he is
[2:09:52] you're lost
[2:09:54] i met people around the pentecostals and
[2:09:56] charismatics who say it doesn't matter
[2:09:58] how you're baptized it does matter
[2:10:00] of course it matters why would the bible
[2:10:02] tell us how to be baptized if it didn't
[2:10:03] matter course it matters
[2:10:06] jesus said except you believe that i am
[2:10:08] he you will die in your sin
[2:10:11] he is the revelation of god the spirit
[2:10:13] of god
[2:10:14] revealed in human form are you still
[2:10:16] with me
[2:10:17] you can't believe that you're lost
[2:10:21] you put him a third person second person
[2:10:23] or any other person besides god you're
[2:10:25] lost
[2:10:27] that's serious business
[2:10:30] except you believe that i am he you will
[2:10:32] die in your sins
[2:10:34] and look at how he how he accentuates
[2:10:36] and punctuates that last a revelation
[2:10:40] a revelation now we talked about how
[2:10:44] that it was a revelation of who god is
[2:10:47] and who god desired to be in brother
[2:10:49] branham's life that got him through the
[2:10:51] difficulty of losing his wife
[2:10:53] and
[2:10:54] daughter and the the congressman asked
[2:10:58] him he said uh bill how did you hold on
[2:11:00] to your religion
[2:11:02] during such a trial as that he said i
[2:11:04] didn't
[2:11:06] it held on to me
[2:11:07] how many of you are glad you've got a
[2:11:09] revelation
[2:11:11] that's holding on to you
[2:11:13] works is faith express paragraph 105.
[2:11:16] let's stay together now
[2:11:18] now faith is a revelation from god now
[2:11:20] faith is a revelation that's what i want
[2:11:23] to say there just a moment it's a
[2:11:24] revelation he has revealed it to you by
[2:11:26] his grace it's nothing you did you
[2:11:29] didn't work yourself up into faith
[2:11:31] aren't you glad to know that you didn't
[2:11:33] work yourself up into faith if you've
[2:11:35] got real faith god gave it to you by
[2:11:37] revelation you didn't have to hold your
[2:11:39] mouth just right
[2:11:43] say so many hail mary's just right
[2:11:48] eat fish on friday
[2:11:53] go to church on ash
[2:11:55] wednesday thank you
[2:11:58] get your dogs blessed on whatever day
[2:12:00] they bless the dogs
[2:12:03] aren't you glad you didn't have to do
[2:12:04] all that god reveals it to you therefore
[2:12:07] therefore
[2:12:09] faith
[2:12:10] is
[2:12:12] a revelation
[2:12:13] and the whole church of god is built
[2:12:16] upon a revelation you see intellectual
[2:12:19] faith can deceive you
[2:12:21] because it's based on facts i want you
[2:12:24] to know there is a faith that is not
[2:12:26] always based on fact
[2:12:30] someone said what in the world does that
[2:12:31] mean i mean factoids
[2:12:35] do you know how the world tries to talk
[2:12:37] to us in factoids
[2:12:42] bullet points some people call them
[2:12:45] did i understand that the canadian
[2:12:47] government is now suggesting that people
[2:12:48] take a booster ever what honey
[2:12:50] every nine months
[2:12:53] factoids
[2:12:57] we have all come to question science in
[2:12:59] this hour brother branham was
[2:13:00] questioning it a generation ago
[2:13:03] we've all come to question science a
[2:13:05] little bit now
[2:13:06] because we realize that science is so
[2:13:08] fickle it really depends on the
[2:13:10] researcher
[2:13:12] i can say whatever i want to if i've got
[2:13:14] the pedigree after my name and it
[2:13:16] automatically can become fact
[2:13:18] that doesn't change the reality
[2:13:20] so sometimes faith is based on more than
[2:13:22] a factoid
[2:13:24] or what the world calls a fact they'll
[2:13:26] say well that's just a fact
[2:13:28] or you'll hear people say that's a fact
[2:13:30] with my hand up
[2:13:32] you don't know whether to go to the bank
[2:13:34] on that or not
[2:13:36] i wonder how they felt just north of the
[2:13:37] border this week when the entire
[2:13:40] electronic system shut down for an
[2:13:42] entire day
[2:13:43] nobody's credit card work nobody's check
[2:13:46] card work nobody's internet worked
[2:13:51] a whole single day
[2:13:53] of having to scramble around and figure
[2:13:55] out what you're going to do it's coming
[2:13:58] [Music]
[2:14:00] it's coming
[2:14:02] the first thing that people began to say
[2:14:04] across the nation was is this a glitch
[2:14:06] or is this an experiment
[2:14:10] coming through what we have been through
[2:14:12] in this hour i would say
[2:14:15] more likely an experiment
[2:14:18] than a glitch
[2:14:20] we have come to live like a cashless
[2:14:22] society every time i go to the bank i
[2:14:24] want to spit
[2:14:26] there is no coin shortage
[2:14:28] there never was a coin shortage it's
[2:14:31] something factoids made up
[2:14:36] the truth is they don't want to fool a
[2:14:37] coin
[2:14:40] do you know they charge this church
[2:14:43] to process our coins
[2:14:50] did you know they charged this church to
[2:14:52] process your cash
[2:14:56] we get a fee every month
[2:14:59] based on how much cash we deposit
[2:15:04] somebody somewhere is moving us
[2:15:09] into an existence that looks a whole lot
[2:15:11] different than the one we're
[2:15:12] experiencing now you better have you
[2:15:14] some cash
[2:15:17] because just after the bride gets out of
[2:15:19] here and there may be experiments before
[2:15:21] she gets out of here your cash is going
[2:15:23] to do you no good
[2:15:25] the bible said that in that great
[2:15:27] tribulation they'll throw their their
[2:15:29] money into the streets silver and gold
[2:15:31] in the tree worth nothing
[2:15:37] it could be devalued tomorrow
[2:15:40] the whole financial system of the world
[2:15:42] is about to shift
[2:15:45] it's already in place
[2:15:47] they're already ready chad was with me
[2:15:49] in in calgary preaching a conference in
[2:15:51] calgary and i had a meeting with a woman
[2:15:53] a chicken farmer
[2:15:57] who asked for a meeting with me who knew
[2:15:59] more about the financial systems of this
[2:16:01] world than anybody i'd ever met
[2:16:05] she began to tell me about top level
[2:16:07] meetings that she had been invited to
[2:16:09] chicken farmer
[2:16:13] because she found out some things and
[2:16:16] they found out that she found out
[2:16:19] and instead of killing her like they
[2:16:21] would have
[2:16:22] they decided to make her a consultant
[2:16:27] chicken farmer
[2:16:30] she learned what was going on in the
[2:16:32] islands of the sea she learned what was
[2:16:34] happening with the devaluing of currency
[2:16:37] i want you to know the spirit
[2:16:40] of the end time we're there
[2:16:42] the systems that will hijack the life as
[2:16:45] we know it it's there
[2:16:48] we're going to have to adjust some of
[2:16:50] our business
[2:16:52] even though we know these things are
[2:16:54] reserved for the exit of the bride if
[2:16:57] they run more experiments
[2:17:03] you see all the hacking
[2:17:07] shut down a banking system with a hack
[2:17:10] what about a power grid
[2:17:14] what would we have done in texas what
[2:17:16] would we do in this
[2:17:17] in this alabama humidity
[2:17:20] if they shut down the peregrine i want
[2:17:22] you to know something during the storm
[2:17:24] the other day the power flickers and
[2:17:26] goes off and i mean i go to tongues
[2:17:31] i did i was right by myself and it went
[2:17:34] off for just a few seconds and i'm in
[2:17:36] the floor oh god in the name of jesus
[2:17:43] i can't take it if the power goes off
[2:17:48] i melt
[2:17:50] don't you act like you don't enjoy it
[2:17:53] now you heard them sister beth they're
[2:17:55] all looking ah spoiled baby breath
[2:17:58] we're all a little bit small
[2:18:00] when it comes to something like that i
[2:18:02] mean i was ready to pray the world into
[2:18:04] salvation i mean i'm i said oh god let
[2:18:07] that tree roll off of the line
[2:18:10] calm the winds
[2:18:14] what would we do with some little wizard
[2:18:18] some of the demon possessed hoodlum
[2:18:22] sits down in a computer and shuts down
[2:18:24] the power grid
[2:18:26] we're living in an hour where the
[2:18:29] wickedness of men's heart is increasing
[2:18:34] and there's going to be a desperation
[2:18:37] strike the earth
[2:18:38] before the rapture
[2:18:41] and i know that because that's going to
[2:18:44] drive the final harvest
[2:18:48] they're going to run to you
[2:18:52] they're going to hope that you have an
[2:18:54] answer
[2:18:57] and you're going to have to have more
[2:18:58] than a quote
[2:18:59] well let me see brother branham said
[2:19:02] you're going to have to have a living
[2:19:04] word in you
[2:19:05] you're going to have to be able to pray
[2:19:07] the power and authority of god down
[2:19:09] you're going to have to be to move some
[2:19:10] things and shift some things
[2:19:12] whoa
[2:19:17] i i want you to know something i
[2:19:19] i saw my wife and i talked about
[2:19:22] we saw the favor of god
[2:19:25] in our in our trip
[2:19:28] unlike maybe ever before you're holding
[2:19:32] your breath you ever get this way you
[2:19:34] hold your breath because you know it's
[2:19:35] got to there's got to be a train wreck
[2:19:37] coming
[2:19:38] because everything's so smooth
[2:19:40] you're passing through immigration
[2:19:43] you're passing on the plane
[2:19:45] and people are actually kind again they
[2:19:48] can get oxygen
[2:19:50] they can breathe
[2:19:52] they're not oxygen deprived so you come
[2:19:54] onto a plane now some of them are a
[2:19:56] little on the unusual side
[2:20:04] i come this close to saying to this
[2:20:06] steward
[2:20:11] i don't really prefer the shade of your
[2:20:13] nail polish
[2:20:17] a deeper blue would have suited your
[2:20:19] outfit a whole lot better than what you
[2:20:21] had on
[2:20:22] but at least
[2:20:24] they were friendly to people
[2:20:27] welcome aboard
[2:20:29] so glad to see
[2:20:31] a few few months ago people shoving one
[2:20:34] another to get their bag in the and and
[2:20:36] i saw people helping one another like it
[2:20:38] used to be helping one another again
[2:20:41] and i'm thinking lord thank you thank
[2:20:43] you thank you for a little bit of relief
[2:20:46] and we just walked in favor and
[2:20:48] everything just fell into place and the
[2:20:50] rental car and everything we did and
[2:20:52] touched was just easy and you're bracing
[2:20:54] yourself
[2:20:57] because you're expecting it to all come
[2:20:59] crumbling down and i caught myself one
[2:21:01] day doing that and i repented before god
[2:21:03] and i said oh god i i should have
[2:21:05] expected this people are praying
[2:21:08] people are believing you to help us on
[2:21:10] this thing and you're helping us and
[2:21:13] we're just waiting on you to stop
[2:21:14] helping us or something
[2:21:16] i believe this little bride can walk
[2:21:18] under that open heaven and i believe she
[2:21:20] can experience the favor of god in
[2:21:23] unprecedented ways while the world
[2:21:26] outside house
[2:21:28] we can still prosper
[2:21:31] you believe that same man
[2:21:35] i want to read this quote here we'll
[2:21:37] we'll be done in a bit i
[2:21:39] i mean i've
[2:21:40] i hadn't preached in
[2:21:42] two weeks so i'm
[2:21:46] i hope you come with a snack
[2:21:50] leading of the spirit
[2:21:52] paragraph 62
[2:21:54] there are so many super let let me read
[2:21:57] this first uh charity i'm sorry let me
[2:21:59] read first timothy 1 4 in the complete
[2:22:02] jewish bible can i do that
[2:22:04] first timothy 1 4 complete jewish bible
[2:22:08] this is a scripture that's a little bit
[2:22:09] baffling there as paul is talking to
[2:22:11] timothy about fables and endless
[2:22:14] genealogies
[2:22:16] and uh that that produce
[2:22:19] unnecessary questions
[2:22:22] and i like the way that the the dr stern
[2:22:26] translates this
[2:22:28] in the complete jewish bible
[2:22:30] he said
[2:22:32] have them stop devoting their attention
[2:22:36] to myths
[2:22:43] can i talk to you a little bit about it
[2:22:46] myths
[2:22:48] legends
[2:22:51] fantasies
[2:22:55] opening your heart
[2:22:57] to the world
[2:22:59] instead of opening your heart
[2:23:01] to the word
[2:23:03] i want you to be careful
[2:23:05] the holy ghost is grieved
[2:23:07] i don't want him grave with me
[2:23:10] i don't want him greed with you
[2:23:12] but as i told you earlier groaning and
[2:23:16] grieving i don't want to say too much
[2:23:18] about it
[2:23:20] i'd rather leave you
[2:23:22] prayerful
[2:23:25] about what kind of a situation would
[2:23:27] cause
[2:23:28] such a disturbance in the spirit world
[2:23:30] but it is when god sees his people
[2:23:33] opening their hearts
[2:23:36] have them stop devoting their attention
[2:23:38] to myths and never ending genealogies
[2:23:42] people get so caught up in this uh uh uh
[2:23:45] hebraic british thing and and uh
[2:23:49] studying about whether the royal family
[2:23:51] or jew or descendants of the jews and
[2:23:53] and what tribe what tribe someone is and
[2:23:56] and and how they scat they get all
[2:23:58] caught up in in in the podcast and in
[2:24:01] the books and in the websites and and
[2:24:04] they get all
[2:24:06] lost like my dear friend uh eric who who
[2:24:09] got so caught up in every conspiracy
[2:24:13] theory
[2:24:16] until you couldn't talk with him about
[2:24:18] logical reasonable things anymore even
[2:24:21] spiritual things there was a season
[2:24:23] where you couldn't even talk to him
[2:24:24] about spiritual things because he was so
[2:24:26] caught up
[2:24:31] these divert people
[2:24:34] this is a tremendous translation
[2:24:37] these divert people to speculating
[2:24:40] instead of doing god's work
[2:24:46] which requires trust
[2:24:48] you may not figure it all out
[2:24:52] you may wonder
[2:24:56] where somebody got his wife
[2:25:00] you may wonder about things
[2:25:03] you might give a reasonable amount of
[2:25:05] thought
[2:25:06] to some of these mysteries that we don't
[2:25:08] completely understand
[2:25:11] oh i
[2:25:12] i had to catch myself because
[2:25:15] my good friend hunter he
[2:25:17] he he he stays on top of a lot of things
[2:25:23] and he wanted to talk about some things
[2:25:25] and i would go so far and then i
[2:25:27] realized i had to pull back because
[2:25:29] uh you can get off you can slip off the
[2:25:32] slope
[2:25:35] when people start talking about
[2:25:37] reptilians and
[2:25:40] flat earths and
[2:25:43] mermaids and
[2:25:47] i've experienced some of these things
[2:25:50] i don't look at them the same way that
[2:25:51] everybody some people look at them
[2:25:54] and so it challenges me
[2:25:57] when i've told you before when i see
[2:25:59] children playing with things that i have
[2:26:02] dealt with in the spirit world
[2:26:06] it it worries me
[2:26:08] it bothers me
[2:26:11] i i understand how how curses
[2:26:16] are pronounced
[2:26:18] and how witchcraft can operate in
[2:26:21] churches
[2:26:27] and it makes you want to be
[2:26:29] a little
[2:26:31] like brother greeley said
[2:26:33] stay a little closer to the mountain
[2:26:35] a little farther away from the edge
[2:26:41] i didn't let my little girls play with
[2:26:42] mermaids
[2:26:44] because of experiences that i had had in
[2:26:47] the spirit
[2:26:50] because i didn't ever want that to
[2:26:52] become such a sweet thing
[2:26:55] when in all of my experiences it was
[2:26:58] demonic
[2:27:03] we don't want to open our hearts to the
[2:27:05] world until we get more used to the
[2:27:07] world
[2:27:08] then we do the word
[2:27:10] so paul is careful here to timothy he
[2:27:13] said have them stop devoting their
[2:27:15] attention to myths and never-ending
[2:27:17] genealogies that divert people to
[2:27:20] speculating instead of doing god's work
[2:27:22] which requires trust some things we may
[2:27:24] not understand but we just trust
[2:27:28] that god is going to help us get through
[2:27:30] them if you believe that same man
[2:27:33] there are so many supernatural elements
[2:27:35] to this message of truth that to be able
[2:27:37] to explain them all seems like an
[2:27:40] impossible task
[2:27:42] but once it is revealed to you
[2:27:47] then you understand what the prophet
[2:27:49] said when he talked about it needing we
[2:27:51] need both the word
[2:27:54] and
[2:27:55] the moving of the spirit
[2:27:57] to quicken and make alive
[2:28:00] that written word he said if you if you
[2:28:02] take away either
[2:28:05] you have to offer the people a
[2:28:08] substitution
[2:28:10] and he said any substitution any form of
[2:28:13] substitution is spells balaamism
[2:28:17] a mixture
[2:28:19] and we don't want a mixture
[2:28:21] so when you hear someone trying to take
[2:28:23] away the supernatural from the word
[2:28:27] it's a very very slick and sly demonic
[2:28:31] uh effort
[2:28:33] to divert our attention
[2:28:35] away from the things that really matter
[2:28:36] the quickening power that makes the word
[2:28:38] alive got to have it both got to have it
[2:28:40] both we've got to have a mo he said we
[2:28:42] must have them both
[2:28:45] and so don't get too caught up over
[2:28:46] there trying to figure out if if if
[2:28:50] you know who who assassinated jfk and
[2:28:58] i mean my goodness there's people who
[2:29:00] believe that george floyd is living on
[2:29:02] an island somewhere
[2:29:06] oh it got real quiet
[2:29:10] maybe some of you folks have been to
[2:29:11] visit him or something you know
[2:29:12] something i don't know
[2:29:14] the man that lay dead up there in the
[2:29:15] street
[2:29:17] murdered killed really by police
[2:29:18] officers i saw it there's no way in the
[2:29:20] world i could deny what i saw with my
[2:29:22] own eyes
[2:29:26] and even the justice system of our
[2:29:27] nation is making sure that that these
[2:29:30] things are not
[2:29:31] a common practice
[2:29:33] but there are people who believe he
[2:29:34] wasn't killed it was all phony and all
[2:29:36] faked and the videos were fake and he's
[2:29:38] living somewhere
[2:29:39] that people gave him money and he's
[2:29:40] living on an island somewhere uh i i if
[2:29:43] i had to bed i'm not a betting man but
[2:29:45] if i had the bed i'd say it's the same
[2:29:46] one elvis lives on
[2:29:50] because he hadn't been seen at the gas
[2:29:52] station lately
[2:30:00] he's probably over there with the loch
[2:30:01] ness monster and bigfoot too but
[2:30:04] be careful what you say
[2:30:08] myths and genealogies and questions that
[2:30:11] we can't all understand now you're
[2:30:13] wondering why i'm saying that here we go
[2:30:16] leading of the spirit of god
[2:30:17] campbellsville kentucky 1955 paragraph
[2:30:20] 62 and i'm gonna hush after that maybe
[2:30:24] oh my oh my
[2:30:27] oh my hallelujah
[2:30:34] he said i am not beside myself no but
[2:30:36] such a feeling to know that now right
[2:30:38] here stands jesus
[2:30:41] the one who raised from the dead the one
[2:30:43] who loves you so much he's speaking for
[2:30:45] me now
[2:30:48] i've been preaching about him he's
[2:30:50] talking now
[2:30:52] that's him
[2:30:56] excuse me lady
[2:30:58] i didn't mean to leave you
[2:31:00] i have to follow the way the spirit
[2:31:03] leads
[2:31:05] now here's a dark streak coming from a
[2:31:07] woman to another one
[2:31:10] what is it it's a devil
[2:31:14] i love this next phrase
[2:31:16] he knows his time has come
[2:31:21] now do i have just a few more minutes
[2:31:23] here
[2:31:24] when the enemy begins to sense that
[2:31:27] something is about to break through at
[2:31:29] nhrm
[2:31:35] he will stir
[2:31:37] somebody
[2:31:38] he will stir
[2:31:40] something
[2:31:41] to distract to divert
[2:31:45] he'll he'll cause some glitter to catch
[2:31:47] your eye
[2:31:52] he'll shoot somebody with poison
[2:31:56] he'll do anything and everything he can
[2:31:58] why because he knows his time has come
[2:32:02] hallelujah
[2:32:04] so what did this bride do we'll hang
[2:32:05] together
[2:32:07] we'll be
[2:32:08] unoffendable only by grace only by grace
[2:32:12] only by grace
[2:32:14] we'll be unoffendable
[2:32:16] and we'll press through this thing like
[2:32:17] bulldozers for the kingdom of god
[2:32:23] what god is going to do in the young
[2:32:25] married couples of this church
[2:32:28] is going to make a tremendous difference
[2:32:31] for the young people who are coming
[2:32:32] behind them
[2:32:35] and god is confirming that word to me by
[2:32:38] sending us more young married couples
[2:32:42] who have a hunger for the word of god
[2:32:46] [Applause]
[2:32:49] some months ago the lord spoke to me and
[2:32:51] he said i want you to make a list of
[2:32:53] kingdom couples
[2:32:57] and so i went through this church and i
[2:32:59] made a list of young married couples and
[2:33:02] the holy ghost called them kingdom
[2:33:04] couples and i've been praying over them
[2:33:07] every day calling their names out before
[2:33:09] the lord i'm just now mentioning it here
[2:33:11] for the first time
[2:33:12] but i've been praying for them and i've
[2:33:14] been asking the lord for confirmation
[2:33:20] and while i was in texas i had
[2:33:22] confirmation i don't think it would be
[2:33:26] necessary to share how it came but it
[2:33:28] came from jenna's dad
[2:33:31] he said something to me
[2:33:33] that confirmed to me something that i'd
[2:33:36] been holding on to
[2:33:37] about kingdom couples
[2:33:40] and then the news comes this week here's
[2:33:42] another couple and they're going to be
[2:33:43] persecuted by those who don't understand
[2:33:48] and they're going to be leave hurt
[2:33:49] feelings behind because families don't
[2:33:52] understand i'm telling you our own blood
[2:33:54] family sometimes doesn't understand that
[2:33:55] when the spirit says get out
[2:34:00] that we have to be have to be obedient
[2:34:03] we must be obedient
[2:34:05] anybody with me anybody with me

[2:36:08] tuesday night full obedience this is 64
[2:36:11] the token
[2:36:13] full obedience to the full word of god
[2:36:16] entitles us to the token
[2:36:20] no other way is there
[2:36:23] that you could ever be entitled to the
[2:36:25] token
[2:36:27] until you fully obey the word that's why
[2:36:30] you must shut your heart
[2:36:32] to the world and open your heart to the
[2:36:35] word
[2:36:37] no other way is there that you could
[2:36:39] ever be entitled to the token until you
[2:36:40] fully obey the word not what somebody
[2:36:42] has put into it
[2:36:44] and added to it
[2:36:46] but what god said about it
[2:36:48] isn't that a good one
[2:36:49] paragraph 118 i couldn't find the one
[2:36:51] that i was looking for but the one i was
[2:36:53] looking for talks about when when you
[2:36:55] hear god speak
[2:36:57] do it
[2:37:01] right then
[2:37:02] go wait obey him
[2:37:05] you know why because if you wait those
[2:37:08] old thoughts will start gnawing gnawing
[2:37:10] nagging
[2:37:13] that demon was calling out for help
[2:37:15] we're back to paragraph 63 i've had too
[2:37:17] much fun
[2:37:19] and i'm all everywhere
[2:37:21] that little lady let's see
[2:37:24] 62 it's a devil he knows his time has
[2:37:26] come
[2:37:28] you're extremely nervous aren't you lady
[2:37:30] just hysterically nervous i see you
[2:37:32] trying to do things that you just can't
[2:37:34] you're just nervous mental nervous
[2:37:37] satan told you that you're going to lose
[2:37:40] your mind if you didn't get over it but
[2:37:42] he lied
[2:37:44] he lied to you
[2:37:47] he lied to you
[2:37:50] that that little lady sitting right
[2:37:52] there second one in the right back there
[2:37:54] she's bothered with nervousness too
[2:37:57] isn't that right lady
[2:37:59] see what i mean
[2:38:00] this demon knows if that woman
[2:38:08] do you hear what he said
[2:38:10] this demon knows if that woman will
[2:38:16] you can do it
[2:38:18] sister you can halfway believe
[2:38:22] you may not feel like you can believe
[2:38:24] believe believe all the way but you can
[2:38:26] have way belief
[2:38:29] and somebody said what in the world does
[2:38:30] that mean it means lord i believe help
[2:38:32] bow my unbelief

[2:39:13] accumulate unbelief
[2:39:17] you know why we've been bound so long
[2:39:20] because that's how things operate in the
[2:39:21] spirit world
[2:39:24] the influence
[2:39:26] of one over another
[2:39:28] spirits calling out to another spirit
[2:39:32] trying to be strengthened trying to hold

[2:40:51] faith
[2:40:55] wait a minute
[2:40:57] prophet said to the devil i challenge
[2:40:59] you
[2:41:00] in a duel of faith how's that possible
[2:41:02] because demons believe in tremble
[2:41:06] here's the problem they don't have a
[2:41:07] revelation of faith
[2:41:08] the only faith a demon has is faith by
[2:41:11] concept by intellect by mental thought
[2:41:14] they haven't had a revelation of faith i
[2:41:17] want you to know that every time a
[2:41:19] revelation of faith comes to a duel
[2:41:23] comes to a war
[2:41:25] with only a mental concept of faith
[2:41:28] faith by revelation will win every time
[2:41:34] that's why we've got to pray and pray
[2:41:36] and pray some more lord quicken your
[2:41:38] word to me until it becomes a revelation
[2:41:40] oh quickening let it become a revelation
[2:41:42] in my inner being hallelujah let me live
[2:41:45] out of revelation instead of out of my
[2:41:47] mental concept let me live out of my
[2:41:49] spirit instead of living out of my mind
[2:41:53] let me get above my mind my will and my
[2:41:55] emotions
[2:41:57] live in the super super race super gift
[2:42:00] of faith super sense of faith
[2:42:02] i lay my hands upon this my sister satan
[2:42:04] you evil selfish ungodly spirit
[2:42:06] musicians are coming
[2:42:09] i challenge you in the name of jesus
[2:42:10] christ in the duel of faith you're
[2:42:13] exposed
[2:42:15] come out of the woman in jesus name go
[2:42:18] in peace my daughter and may god be with
[2:42:20] you
[2:42:21] and bless you
[2:42:24] i wanted you to see this
[2:42:28] because this is a little bit about how
[2:42:31] demons can operate to distract
[2:42:35] to get our minds running down bunny
[2:42:37] trails
[2:42:39] of myths and genealogies and
[2:42:42] thought processes
[2:42:47] the church
[2:42:49] can easily be guilty
[2:42:54] well-meaning people calling this
[2:42:56] vaccination the
[2:42:58] mark of the beast
[2:43:00] and so that goes raging through social
[2:43:02] media
[2:43:04] and there's no truth to that
[2:43:07] wasn't the mark of the beast we've had a
[2:43:09] prophet come and tell us
[2:43:11] how the mark of the beast is going to
[2:43:12] operate
[2:43:14] if you say that it certainly
[2:43:16] opens doors and leads ways yes it shows
[2:43:19] you that all that has to happen is for
[2:43:22] the government to tell people what to do
[2:43:24] and they line up like little bunny
[2:43:25] rabbits
[2:43:29] i may get flagged i may get flagged
[2:43:30] hadn't i
[2:43:36] it shows us that the mark of the beast
[2:43:38] will not be a problem
[2:43:44] because people are just trusting
[2:43:47] we need revelation
[2:43:49] we need revelation i know it's been a
[2:43:51] bit controversial but i don't care
[2:43:55] if we just say what everybody else is
[2:43:57] saying
[2:44:04] i wanted you to see a little bit about
[2:44:06] how those demon spirits operate even in
[2:44:08] a service
[2:44:09] calling out to one another
[2:44:11] brother branham told us the worst kind
[2:44:13] of demon is the religious kind
[2:44:15] that's the kind that goes to church
[2:44:17] every service
[2:44:19] they don't miss a service you can count
[2:44:21] on the religious demons to show up every
[2:44:24] service and if they can't get a ride
[2:44:26] with who they usually hitch with they'll
[2:44:27] find somebody else to hit your ride with
[2:44:29] they'll show up they'll be here you can
[2:44:30] rest assured they will be here
[2:44:36] you want to overcome
[2:44:39] keep your eyes off people
[2:44:43] keep them on jesus
[2:44:45] he'll never fail he'll never let you
[2:44:47] down he'll never disappoint you he'll
[2:44:49] never compromise on what is right
[2:44:51] he is truth
[2:44:53] he doesn't just know truth he is truth
[2:44:56] i don't want any of us to be satisfied
[2:44:58] until we know that we are positioning
[2:45:00] ourselves for a revelation
[2:45:03] for god's word to be quickened and to be
[2:45:06] made alive in our hearts and lives so
[2:45:09] that when the wars come when the battles
[2:45:12] come when the testings come we have
[2:45:14] something to fight with
[2:45:16] you know i've used this example before
[2:45:18] those sons of skiva
[2:45:21] you know they got up there and they've
[2:45:23] seen it done many many times folks get
[2:45:25] like that they think
[2:45:27] it looks easy
[2:45:29] we've seen it done enough we'll jump up
[2:45:31] and just call the devils out too
[2:45:35] and they got up and they didn't even
[2:45:36] know how what to say so in the name of
[2:45:38] the one who paul preaches about
[2:45:41] they're they're just trying to figure a
[2:45:42] way well they come out all right
[2:45:45] they want it out of there
[2:45:47] because they wanted to show the
[2:45:48] preachers how foolish they were
[2:45:51] they come out all right
[2:45:53] they beat them
[2:45:54] sons of skiva up
[2:45:56] stripped them of their clothes and left
[2:45:58] them running through the streets naked
[2:46:00] you better know what you're tangling
[2:46:02] with
[2:46:03] and you better do it with a revelation
[2:46:05] it's not enough to say well i heard
[2:46:07] brother branham do it this way so i'm
[2:46:08] going to try to deal with this devil
[2:46:10] that way you better have a revelation of
[2:46:12] the one who lives inside of you
[2:46:15] before you grab a hold of the devil's
[2:46:17] toe
[2:46:19] once you know what's been revealed to
[2:46:20] you and you know that god's word is true
[2:46:23] and you're not looking at your life
[2:46:25] you're looking at his life yes there is
[2:46:27] no demon power that can stand in your
[2:46:29] way as a part of god's little bride if
[2:46:32] you believe that same man let's stand
[2:46:34] together praise god
[2:46:39] hallelujah
[2:47:01] there's a emergency prayer request here
[2:47:05] to pray i guess this would be the cousin
[2:47:08] of your children brother robert is that

[2:48:22] a mental thought but may we have a faith
[2:48:25] that comes by such a revelation
[2:48:28] that we are not afraid to stand even
[2:48:30] against the wiles of the enemy in this
[2:48:32] hour firm on the word
