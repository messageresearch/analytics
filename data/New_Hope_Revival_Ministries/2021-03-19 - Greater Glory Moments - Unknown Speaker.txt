TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we haven't seen the greater glory the greater glory is ahead [Music] i'm not going gonna let wearing glasses kill me i want my eyes healed oh how i'd like to not ever have to use these glasses anymore but i'm thankful to have them do you understand paul didn't have any glasses he's riding in a in a dungeon he's writing in memory in prison in a hole in the rock in rome he's writing the epistles to the church by a little flicker of light and poor eyesight and yet he said i want to make sure that i don't get puffed up in these revelations but i want to recognize that god has given me a gift a thorn in the flesh wrapped up with a bow you're with me [Music] i'm an angel of satan he's given me to pummel me to buffet me [Music] to hit me in every direction over everything i do and yet i'm going to learn to rejoice i'm going to take pleasure in my infirmities and in my reproaches and in my necessities and in my persecutions if you have convinced yourself that that's only for new testament believers those who live contemporary in the new testament you're wrong i'm telling you if it was available to the first church age bride it's available to the last church age bride and maybe you believe what i believe i believe all the evils of every church age were gathered into the last laodicea and in that same regard i believe that every anointing and every glory and every strength and every power that was given to those believers in all of those church ages has now fallen upon us in this last church age by the grace of the lord here is the first church age messenger telling us that he came to enjoy [Music] he came to enjoy the infirmities can you imagine can you imagine saying here he comes again i run that old boy off and there the devil comes again paul had a revelation he got caught up above what it felt like he got caught up above what it smelled like what it sounded like what it looked like what it felt like he got caught up above that and he knew there was a greater glory coming he knew that this was necessary it was necessary to keep him at the right place to keep his soul in the right place his spirit in the right place his flesh in the right place because of greater glory i tell you church we haven't seen the greater glory the greater glory is ahead and we if we could just catch a glimpse of it hallelujah some people they're in the heat of the battle and they sing songs about heaven and eternity and living with the lord and it causes them to rejoice they can get through oh they can get past how many of you been coming through some things let me see your hand been coming through i'm not through i'm coming through i'm still being squeezed through the pipe but i'm coming out the other side hallelujah with a greater glory and there's a key there's a key there is a key to getting there faster than not and that key is coming to a place where you can say thank you lord [Music]
