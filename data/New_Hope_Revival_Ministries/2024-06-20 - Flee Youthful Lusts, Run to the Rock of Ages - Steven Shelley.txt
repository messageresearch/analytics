TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but how many of you believe it's very possible for a young man to grow up in faith to have a real genuine experience with God to be born again as a child filled with the Holy Ghost and stay in the word now I'm not an example for all things that's what my life was he filled me with the Holy Ghost when I was seven years old I want you to know it made a difference in my life it didn't always make me right it didn't mean always did the right thing but it meant I always knew where to come back to I always knew where to look to and so to me my testimony is not like yours but I'm going to hold it up we needed God when we breathed our first breath but there's no reason for us to think that a young man can't flee youthful lust he can when he's full of the Holy Ghost and he must Paul was sure about it this is still good advice in our generation we live in a sensual idolatrous money-loving lustful Society every device the devil can use he'll do to subvert a soul we have to flee and that doesn't mean crawl away it means run away like you're fleeing a bear like you're fleeing a serpent like you're fleeing a hungry lion run remember we're not just fleeing from something but we're fleeing to something we're running to the Rock of Ages the men in this church and fathers in this church and husbands in this church who are successful in their life they're not just running from the devil they're running to the Rock of Ages they're running to the rock that will never fail them you believe that they're running to the rock that was split on their behalf Rock of Ages cleft for me there are some things we ought to be with to fight for in our generation fight for your own personal identity as a man fight the battle for personal Holiness fight the battle for your family fight through the pain of living in a fallen world fight for some close Godly friends fight to have a strong faith when asking what does a man of God look like perhaps the best way to summarize what a Godly Man looks like according to the Bible is is with these words sacrificial love yes do what you do act like men do what you do with Love by love
