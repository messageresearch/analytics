[0:00] above everything else guard your heart
[0:05] for it is the source of life's
[0:10] consequences now consequences are the
[0:13] circumstances that happen to us because
[0:16] of decisions that we have made that's
[0:19] what a consequence is everything that
[0:21] happens in your life flows out from your
[0:24] heart that's why the scripture says out
[0:27] of the abundance of the heart
[0:31] the mouth speaketh the mouth talks it's
[0:36] everything you begin to attract the very
[0:41] emotion negative emotion that you hold
[0:44] on to so if you haven't dealt with
[0:48] jealousy it just gets bigger and bigger
[0:51] but what will happen is you will take it
[0:53] out on somebody
[0:58] else that has nothing to do with
[1:03] it and when you're called out you'll say
[1:06] well I I'm just going through something
[1:08] let me give you this good piece of help
[1:11] here
[1:12] everybody everybody is going through
[1:16] something tailor
[1:19] made tailor made by a God who knows
[1:23] exactly what it's going to take for you
[1:26] to run the race that you're called to
[1:29] run and get through that Finish
[1:33] Line when I talk to people about
[1:35] overcoming these kinds of things without
[1:38] a doubt just about at least 99% of them
[1:43] mentioned I did it by my confession I
[1:46] did it by speaking God's word over my
[1:49] life and over the situation I did it by
[1:53] a positive biblical affirmation and an
[1:58] affirmation is an amen
[2:01] if I say uh I'm going to make a positive
[2:04] affirmation I am an overcomer I'm saying
[2:08] Amen to every scripture that says I
[2:14] can God knows right now exactly what you
[2:19] would look like smell like live like
[2:22] talk like drive your car like if you
[2:26] were rid of that stuff and I believe if
[2:29] we ask him he would choose that
[2:32] version a a a version of freedom and
[2:35] deliverance a version where you don't
[2:38] take it out on somebody else when they
[2:40] have nothing to do with the offense that
[2:42] you're carrying a version where you're
[2:45] not doing anything thinking anything
[2:47] talking anything that impedes or
[2:51] paralyzes the kingdom but rather your
[2:55] lifestyle is advancing the kingdom
[2:58] directive of the King of Kings and the
[3:01] Lord of lords the last
[3:05] battle it's the battle of the mind it's
[3:07] fought on the Battlefield of the Mind
[3:11] that's
[3:12] good it's not bad it's good because you
[3:17] own the
[3:19] battlefield woo come on you possess it
[3:24] you've got Authority in it your name is
[3:27] on the deed of this we are taking his
[3:31] mind while slowly losing
[3:34] ours the Apostle Paul didn't want it to
[3:36] be that way he wanted us to be able to
[3:39] lose ours and take
[3:42] Christ's but we understand that as the
[3:45] wickedness of every age
[3:48] compounded that we are now in a greater
[3:51] battle than the one the church in
[3:53] Ephesus
[3:56] fought you own this real estate and
[4:00] you're the only one who can choose to
[4:02] say I
[4:04] have a high
[4:07] priest who is touched by every one of my
[4:11] feelings my legitimate
[4:14] ones and my ignorant
[4:17] ones just call yourself out some of them
[4:21] are
[4:22] real and some of
[4:25] them may not
[4:27] be but I have a counselor
[4:30] a high priest A Healer a savior a
[4:37] deliverer I don't have to drive to his
[4:41] office I don't have to book an
[4:44] appointment I don't have to claim my
[4:47] insurance and I don't have to write him
[4:49] a check all I have to do is surrender my
[4:53] will your counsel your high priest your
[4:57] friend
[5:00] he lives on
[5:01] board come on he sits on the throne of
[5:05] your life if you've given him that
[5:08] place he
[5:10] cares he wants us thinking healthy and
[5:13] whole and he doesn't want us
[5:15] overreacting or under
[5:17] reacting he doesn't want us judging one
[5:20] another's
[5:22] motives he wants us to be
[5:24] free how many of you know it's like a
[5:27] burden lifted if if you ever come to a
[5:29] place that you can let anger go over a
[5:32] situation that you've been holding on to
[5:34] it feels like a ton of bricks has been
[5:38] lifted can you imagine the weight of all
[5:42] of my sin your sin the whole world
[5:47] sin pressed upon
[5:51] him as he died on the cross
[5:55] bearing my sin he that knew no sin
[6:00] carried mine and
[6:03] [Music]
[6:04] yours he knows what it means to be
[6:08] heavy he knows what it means to carry
[6:10] something that didn't belong to
[6:13] him he understands he cares
