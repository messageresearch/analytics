[34:38] to help her
[34:40] ginger sent a
[34:42] request this morning for brother simrock
[34:45] in tucson
[34:46] she has a lot of fond memories of him as
[34:49] her teacher in the second through the
[34:50] fourth grade from what i can tell from
[34:53] this text he's at the er he felt this
[34:55] morning his blood pressure and oxygen
[34:58] low and he's dehydrated and he has
[35:00] developed pneumonia so let's remember
[35:02] this brother simrock in tucson let's ask
[35:05] the lord to touch him
[35:07] was on my heart this morning you
[35:09] mentioned that already your dad if
[35:11] you'll give a little report about your
[35:13] dad so that we can pray for him and then
[35:15] all of those traveling this week some by
[35:18] airplanes some by car far as i know i've
[35:21] only heard from a couple of them of
[35:23] course i know everyone who has left for
[35:25] texas so far has arrived safely without
[35:28] any problems
[35:30] yes amen
[35:31] chad will you come and pray over these
[35:33] requests while you're coming i'll just
[35:35] give you a quick report about dad uh
[35:37] daddy is home
[35:39] the uh they were very pleased with what
[35:41] they saw
[35:42] concerning no more bacteria growing and
[35:46] so we're so very thankful for that
[35:48] they took him before he went home the
[35:51] hospital where he's at is two hours away
[35:53] from where they live
[35:54] so they took him to have this infusion
[35:57] this antibiotic confusion
[35:59] so that mom doesn't have to administer
[36:02] through the picc line every day so
[36:04] they're very thankful for that so in 10
[36:06] days he has to go back to kingsport
[36:08] tennessee to have another infusion of
[36:10] this antibiotic treatment but he is home
[36:13] last night was a better night than the
[36:15] night before so we're very grateful for
[36:17] that
[36:18] would you remember him
[36:20] and his church today
[36:22] he's um
[36:24] i know that it bothers him very much to
[36:26] not be able to be a pastor but one of
[36:28] the brothers in his church has passed uh
[36:31] and uh yesterday morning and so that's
[36:34] another weight on him that
[36:37] i know it's weighing heavy because he
[36:39] can't do anything about it
[36:41] he can't minister at the funeral he
[36:42] can't go to the family because dad has
[36:45] been a goer he he goes all the time but
[36:48] he's confined to home so would you
[36:50] remember that church family to the lord
[36:52] sister veronica keith is is the widow
[36:56] um i know she is hurting but at the same
[36:59] time relieved because her husband's been
[37:02] suffering dementia for a couple of years
[37:04] and he had become a little bit violent
[37:07] and it was very difficult for her and
[37:09] her family so would you remember that
[37:11] family this morning i also had an old
[37:13] friend
[37:14] from the valley from the freedonia
[37:16] community holiness church i've known
[37:18] them my whole life
[37:20] and her husband passed away yesterday
[37:22] from a brain tumor he had had some ups
[37:25] and downs along the way they were
[37:27] married to 51 years i think it was and
[37:29] her name is sister angie and uh
[37:33] literally i've known her my whole life
[37:34] i'd like for her to be lifted up to the
[37:36] lord in prayer today
[37:40] let's pray this morning thank you jesus
[37:42] father we love you god and we thank you
[37:44] for the privilege the opportunity to be
[37:47] gathered again in your name we thank you
[37:50] lord for the presence that's in this

[39:46] this morning while they're getting ready
[39:48] nathan would you come and brother austin
[39:51] hodges we're going to let these two

[40:23] lord of how that you pour your blessing

[40:32] name of the lord jesus christ we pray
[40:35] amen the lord bless you as you give to
[40:38] the lord today just want to report
[40:40] 226
[40:42] 583 dollars and four cents as of today
[40:46] given toward the mortgage of this
[40:48] property the principal we're so
[40:51] grateful for that
[40:54] i have been waffling back and forth what
[40:56] to do because the first sunday we're
[40:58] back together after we're all gone we'll
[41:01] be together on that tuesday night july
[41:03] the 5th but when we're back together on
[41:06] uh
[41:09] july the 10th
[41:11] then that would be the first sunday
[41:13] we're back together for the principal
[41:15] and i'm back and forth about what to do
[41:18] so i'll try to keep you updated about
[41:20] that because i know there's a lot of
[41:21] expense in travel and so forth but i
[41:24] also know when you get momentum you
[41:26] don't want to lose it and so
[41:28] uh i i'm leaning more toward whatever
[41:31] you can give we don't want you to go in
[41:33] debt for it we don't want you to have to
[41:36] carry credit card expense or anything
[41:38] like that but perhaps we can still come
[41:42] and give an offering maybe it'd be a
[41:43] little bit smaller maybe a bit a lot
[41:45] bigger
[41:47] god knows how to provide so i'm leaning
[41:50] toward
[41:51] receiving that offering on the 10th
[41:53] you got off okay
[42:01] [Music]
[42:03] where do i go
[42:06] when there's nobody else to turn to and
[42:10] who do i talk to

[1:01:11] moments
[1:01:12] it's wonderful to be in the presence of
[1:01:14] the lord
[1:01:16] we appreciate brother miller helping us
[1:01:18] out in the guitar we appreciate joseph
[1:01:21] helping us on the drums
[1:01:25] we were
[1:01:27] running we thought on a skeleton crew
[1:01:29] but look what happens you just pulled
[1:01:30] together and we had good special singing
[1:01:33] and we had good worship today with ben
[1:01:36] leading us and we're well we've got some
[1:01:39] empty pews but we do on occasion anyway
[1:01:41] so we're doing all right i did a quick
[1:01:43] scan and counted 68 people
[1:01:46] and you know how in your mind you get
[1:01:48] you get to thinking well that one's gone
[1:01:50] and that one's gone and that one's gone
[1:01:51] and you think well there there'll be
[1:01:53] about 20 of us well we did better than
[1:01:55] that didn't we
[1:01:56] amen i'm thankful for you being here and
[1:01:59] the most important thing is jesus is
[1:02:01] here
[1:02:02] well how do you know that because not
[1:02:04] just because i feel him but because i
[1:02:07] brought him with me
[1:02:09] and even if i didn't feel him that
[1:02:10] doesn't mean he wouldn't be here
[1:02:12] it's not by feelings it's by what we
[1:02:14] know about his promise
[1:02:16] it's about his faithfulness to us
[1:02:18] so real quick we'll leave the musicians
[1:02:20] where they are for just a moment in case
[1:02:22] we should need them
[1:02:24] but we will make some quick
[1:02:25] announcements
[1:02:27] and uh we will move forward brother
[1:02:28] greeley has already mentioned to you
[1:02:30] there will be no service here tuesday
[1:02:32] night or next sunday morning and i would
[1:02:34] ask that the brethren would prepare a
[1:02:36] sign for the door
[1:02:38] in case some people don't follow our
[1:02:39] services by social media they would be
[1:02:42] able to come and see and that's nothing
[1:02:44] that we want to do it's nothing that we
[1:02:46] like doing but we're in a circumstance
[1:02:48] this time where we really need to do it
[1:02:51] that way
[1:02:52] uh if you would like a
[1:02:55] suggestion for a message to hear next
[1:02:58] sunday if you're looking for a
[1:02:59] suggestion i would like to give you the
[1:03:01] suggestion of the sermon blasphemous
[1:03:04] names
[1:03:06] and um i can give you the the address of
[1:03:09] that if you want to jot it down you
[1:03:11] don't have to listen to that on sunday
[1:03:13] you can listen to it during the week
[1:03:15] it's
[1:03:16] 1962.
[1:03:17] it is
[1:03:20] november the 4th in the morning of 1962
[1:03:24] blasphemius names and it was preached in
[1:03:26] jeffersonville indiana
[1:03:29] and uh but you i don't know how long the
[1:03:31] tape is i didn't look to see how long it
[1:03:33] was so you might want to hear some of it
[1:03:35] during the week but the reason why i'm
[1:03:38] suggesting it is because
[1:03:40] i found some quotations that i will use
[1:03:43] this morning from that sermon that
[1:03:45] struck me in a way
[1:03:46] uh that they have never struck me before
[1:03:49] and i'm very curious now to go back
[1:03:52] myself and hear the entire message we
[1:03:56] focus on the theme of the message and he
[1:03:58] was
[1:03:59] using the importance of meeting in the
[1:04:02] name of jesus
[1:04:03] and how that churches will name
[1:04:05] themselves after after jesus without
[1:04:09] having any real revelation of who he is
[1:04:11] he said well that's just like
[1:04:13] blasphemous names mentioned in the book
[1:04:15] of the revelation
[1:04:17] but he was also speaking a little bit
[1:04:19] about the stature of the perfect man
[1:04:22] and he was talking about their being we
[1:04:25] know there's more than one kind of faith
[1:04:27] i'm going to preach about that this
[1:04:28] morning but he was talking about all the
[1:04:31] virtues
[1:04:32] and he was mentioning that there are two
[1:04:35] kinds of each of these virtues they can
[1:04:37] be produced in the earth earthy
[1:04:40] and they're all right
[1:04:42] they're virtues they're good things
[1:04:45] it's good to have mental faith
[1:04:47] it's good to have it that's where all
[1:04:49] faith starts but he said when that that
[1:04:51] is above that faith that is above when
[1:04:53] it comes down i'm about to preach now
[1:04:56] he said when that comes down and and
[1:04:58] meets your faith your carnal your let's
[1:05:01] say mental or intellectual faith when it
[1:05:03] comes down and meets that he said then
[1:05:05] you've got the faith that you've got to
[1:05:07] have
[1:05:08] for the sealing of the bride
[1:05:10] and boy that answered something for me i
[1:05:12] know i've heard that but it just it just
[1:05:15] really stuck out and i regretted that i
[1:05:18] didn't have more time yesterday to go
[1:05:20] and get the whole thing i would like to
[1:05:22] listen to all of it so i thought well
[1:05:24] i'll mention you you might go and get
[1:05:26] over just listen to all of it it's good
[1:05:29] but when you get over that part you
[1:05:31] might pay
[1:05:32] special attention because if it spoke
[1:05:34] out to me like that maybe it will do the
[1:05:37] same for you
[1:05:39] so that is this tuesday and the
[1:05:41] following sunday and then as brother
[1:05:43] greeley mentioned we'll be back together
[1:05:45] on the on tuesday evening
[1:05:47] july the 5th
[1:05:49] and uh we have a few
[1:05:50] uh events this week or things to
[1:05:52] remember and one is that kendra and ben
[1:05:56] are having a wedding anniversary on
[1:05:58] monday
[1:06:00] uh how many years is it now
[1:06:02] nine years well in that wonderful
[1:06:06] praise god they made it nine years
[1:06:13] i remember it like it was yesterday
[1:06:16] i i it their their their wedding had a
[1:06:20] profound impact on me
[1:06:22] and i don't know why well i was just
[1:06:24] glad they were married i was tired of
[1:06:25] trying to keep them apart
[1:06:27] and i was just glad they were married
[1:06:29] and they could smooch and do whatever it
[1:06:31] is they needed to do
[1:06:32] but it it got me
[1:06:35] i felt so emotional in all of that i
[1:06:38] don't know why
[1:06:39] it was almost like my own children
[1:06:41] growing up for something to be married
[1:06:42] and
[1:06:43] and
[1:06:44] i
[1:06:45] they were getting ready to go away on
[1:06:46] their honeymoon and i uh slipped a
[1:06:48] little money in his poc and i sobbed
[1:06:52] i stood on the porch as they're driving
[1:06:54] off
[1:06:56] and everybody else including the family
[1:06:58] is so happy
[1:06:59] rejoicing just so glad to have it done
[1:07:02] and i am just sobbing the tears are just
[1:07:05] i said i don't even know what's wrong
[1:07:06] with me
[1:07:08] i don't even know why i'm crying
[1:07:11] but it just had an impact on me and
[1:07:14] maybe the lord was showing us that
[1:07:17] they were going to have beautiful
[1:07:18] children that would be an important part
[1:07:20] of our lives and i don't know what it
[1:07:22] was but i will never forget it so happy
[1:07:25] anniversary and i pray that there's not
[1:07:28] a repeat performance of my emotions this
[1:07:30] week
[1:07:32] i pray that i can keep all of it
[1:07:34] together i don't want to be standing on
[1:07:35] the porch saying i don't know i'm crying
[1:07:40] nothing manly about that right
[1:07:42] but anyway
[1:07:43] uh happy anniversary to them
[1:07:46] and uh on tuesday of this week sister
[1:07:48] elita's daughter angela has a birthday

[1:13:49] and may god just meet needs that are
[1:13:51] represented by those names are you ready
[1:13:53] for the word
[1:13:54] genesis chapter 4
[1:13:58] beginning in verse 1. i need a little
[1:14:00] time
[1:14:01] and i need you to help me pull
[1:14:03] i just believe god will help us a little
[1:14:05] bit today
[1:14:08] you may think when you
[1:14:10] listen to this that we are
[1:14:12] leaving our our theme of deliverance but
[1:14:16] we're not
[1:14:17] we're just taking a little little side
[1:14:20] trip here
[1:14:21] because
[1:14:23] we're learning again that everything
[1:14:25] that god gives us it comes to us by
[1:14:28] revelation
[1:14:30] and even deliverance is a revelation
[1:14:33] not a feeling
[1:14:35] not a feeling
[1:14:36] deliverance is a revelation
[1:14:39] once you get it once you get a
[1:14:40] revelation i've been freed
[1:14:43] then it manifests because your thoughts
[1:14:45] are shifted your behavior shifts your
[1:14:48] worship goes up to another level because
[1:14:50] you got more to praise god for he set
[1:14:53] you free now let me ask you are there
[1:14:55] any people here today that god has i
[1:14:57] don't just mean from the from the
[1:15:00] thought concept of sin but i mean from
[1:15:02] the real attributes of unbelief is there
[1:15:04] anybody here that can say i've been set
[1:15:06] free from some stuff
[1:15:08] god has delivered me from some things in
[1:15:10] my life
[1:15:12] and so these are real living live
[1:15:15] testimonies
[1:15:16] of god's power to deliver
[1:15:18] and it came of course there were
[1:15:20] probably hands laid on some of you and
[1:15:22] prayers made over some of you but all of
[1:15:24] that was just to get you to a place
[1:15:27] where you could open up your heart of
[1:15:28] faith and receive the revelation of what
[1:15:31] christ had already done for you he'd
[1:15:33] already done it
[1:15:35] if you're ever going to be delivered you
[1:15:36] always were
[1:15:38] he already paid the price
[1:15:41] hallelujah
[1:15:42] genesis 4 and adam knew eve his wife
[1:15:46] and she conceived and bear came
[1:15:49] and said i have gotten a man from the
[1:15:53] lord all
[1:15:54] life comes from the lord this is not
[1:15:57] telling us who the father was it's
[1:16:00] telling us where life comes from
[1:16:03] amen
[1:16:05] life comes from the lord from god and so
[1:16:08] the life that was enabled came from god
[1:16:11] the life that was in cain the breath
[1:16:13] that was in cain came from god right we
[1:16:16] read on
[1:16:17] and she again bore his brother abel and
[1:16:21] abel was a keeper of sheep but cain
[1:16:25] was a tiller of the ground
[1:16:29] we're going to read all the way down to
[1:16:30] verse 8. and in process of time it came
[1:16:34] to pass that cain brought of the fruit
[1:16:37] of the ground an offering unto the lord
[1:16:41] and abel he also brought of the
[1:16:44] firstlings of his flock and of the fat
[1:16:47] thereof and the lord had respect unto
[1:16:50] abel and to his offering but unto cain
[1:16:54] and to his offering he had
[1:16:58] not respect now just for future
[1:17:02] reference i want you to think about he
[1:17:04] neither respected the man
[1:17:07] this is unusual language yes
[1:17:10] god neither respected the man
[1:17:13] or the offering that he brought so god's
[1:17:16] problem was not just with the offering
[1:17:19] the problem was also with the man
[1:17:21] he said but unto cain and to his
[1:17:23] offering he had not respect and cain was
[1:17:26] very roth and his countenance fell so he
[1:17:30] got mad and then he got depressed
[1:17:33] you ever had that happen to you
[1:17:35] all right at least you're honest and the
[1:17:37] lord said unto cain why art thou wroth
[1:17:39] what have you got to be mad about
[1:17:42] and why is thy countenance fallen why
[1:17:44] why'd you got your pouty face on
[1:17:48] he said if thou doest well shalt thou
[1:17:50] not be accepted and if thou doest not
[1:17:52] well sin lieth at the door
[1:17:55] and unto thee shall be his desire and
[1:17:58] thou shalt rule over him
[1:18:01] interesting language i wished i had time
[1:18:03] to talk about it and cain talked with
[1:18:05] abel his brother and it came to pass
[1:18:08] when they were in the field that cain
[1:18:10] rose up against abel his brother and
[1:18:13] slew him
[1:18:14] now god did not respect cain
[1:18:17] because he saw something in cain that
[1:18:20] was not of him
[1:18:23] amen
[1:18:24] he recognized
[1:18:26] that there was a seed in him that was
[1:18:28] not a seed of god
[1:18:30] now that's that's an origin that's an
[1:18:32] origin thing that goes all the way back
[1:18:34] to his conception
[1:18:35] and god was was was you know not
[1:18:38] confused about this situation
[1:18:40] he knew very well what was going on and
[1:18:42] he recognized if there was a seed in
[1:18:44] cain that was not of god and that and
[1:18:47] that cain was capable of things that
[1:18:49] only a non-seed
[1:18:53] we're capable of
[1:18:54] this was murder we're talking about
[1:18:56] chapter four
[1:18:58] we're still at the beginning of the book
[1:19:00] all right and so when they were in the
[1:19:02] field cain rose up against abel his
[1:19:04] brother and slew him and that doesn't
[1:19:06] mean it knocked him down it means he
[1:19:08] killed him
[1:19:09] all right and then before you before
[1:19:11] you're seated if you'll go to hebrews
[1:19:14] chapter 11
[1:19:15] and verse 4 i would like to read a
[1:19:17] little bit about abel and cain again
[1:19:19] hebrews 11 4 by faith
[1:19:22] abel
[1:19:23] offered unto god a more
[1:19:26] excellent sacrifice than cain
[1:19:30] more excellent
[1:19:32] higher than the offering that cain
[1:19:35] brought
[1:19:36] cain brought what was from the ground
[1:19:40] he had some attachment
[1:19:43] but it was just
[1:19:44] vegetables
[1:19:47] but abel brought something that he loved
[1:19:50] i i i don't think that that cain had a
[1:19:53] love affair with turnips
[1:19:58] how could you
[1:20:02] in my family we ate the greens and
[1:20:05] throwed most of the turnip away
[1:20:07] we just chopped up a little bit for
[1:20:08] bitter flavor to add to the green the
[1:20:10] rest went out out in the garbage and and
[1:20:12] you yankees that come you know
[1:20:15] you i understand somewhere up through
[1:20:17] there they eat to turn them throw out
[1:20:19] the greens what's wrong with you people
[1:20:22] true story i'm sticking to it and you
[1:20:24] you throw out most of the vi anyway
[1:20:27] amen by faith abel offered unto god a
[1:20:30] more excellent sacrifice and gain by
[1:20:32] which he obtained witness that he was
[1:20:34] righteous he got a testimony of being
[1:20:37] righteous
[1:20:39] because he brought a god-honoring and
[1:20:41] excellent sacrifice
[1:20:43] powerful god testifying of his gifts
[1:20:51] there's a law there and by it
[1:20:54] he being dead
[1:20:58] yet speaketh did you know abel's
[1:21:01] prophesying to us today
[1:21:04] he's talking to us today may god add his
[1:21:06] blessing to the reading of his word you
[1:21:08] may be seated
[1:21:11] now other than the fact that cain
[1:21:14] the new testament tells us cain was of
[1:21:18] that wicked one
[1:21:21] his
[1:21:22] representation was not in the attributes
[1:21:25] of god as brother branham showed it on
[1:21:27] the board dot dot dot dot dot dot dot
[1:21:31] he said now these were the attributes of
[1:21:34] of one
[1:21:35] heavenly attributes
[1:21:37] but the attributes of the other were of
[1:21:40] the earth
[1:21:41] of the base nature of the nature of
[1:21:43] unbelief this was a product of a
[1:21:45] different seed
[1:21:47] now i cannot
[1:21:49] take the time to talk about the
[1:21:51] difference between the seeds today but i
[1:21:53] can tell you that everything we know
[1:21:56] about this story came out of
[1:22:00] the seed
[1:22:01] that they carried
[1:22:03] and from the beginning of time from the
[1:22:06] garden all the way through to this day
[1:22:09] the enemy is always there to mess
[1:22:13] with the seed
[1:22:15] he wants to destroy
[1:22:18] the seed
[1:22:20] and if he cannot the seed of god and if
[1:22:23] he cannot destroy the seed of god he
[1:22:26] wants to mix it
[1:22:28] that great hybrid
[1:22:30] his whole concept hybriding
[1:22:33] his whole concept mixing up the seed
[1:22:37] contaminating the true
[1:22:40] life and character of almighty god
[1:22:43] bringing in that base nature of lost and
[1:22:47] fallen humanity
[1:22:49] a seed now you know i was reading
[1:22:52] recently where the prophet was talking
[1:22:54] about adultery
[1:22:56] and he said you know eve could have
[1:22:59] never
[1:23:00] uh
[1:23:01] she could have never yielded herself i'm
[1:23:04] going to paraphrase just just a bit but
[1:23:07] you'll get it you can find it and i can
[1:23:09] tell you where to read the word for word
[1:23:11] uh eve would have never
[1:23:13] given herself let's say to that to that
[1:23:16] uh adultery had she not made a decision
[1:23:24] the seed of discrepancy tells us some of
[1:23:26] these things
[1:23:27] she made a decision up here and she she
[1:23:30] took another truth
[1:23:33] see the enemy was there to sow a seed
[1:23:36] of discrepancy
[1:23:38] we're talking about a mental thought
[1:23:41] he was there to sow a mental thought a
[1:23:45] seed
[1:23:46] a thought of the mind that was contrary
[1:23:49] to the absolute of god's word in fact i
[1:23:52] think it may be in the message absolute
[1:23:54] that i'm that i'm talking about this
[1:23:55] particular thing and i hope you're
[1:23:57] paying attention i hope you're not uh
[1:23:59] passing notes i hope you're right here
[1:24:01] with me because this is where we have to
[1:24:03] be for this moment this is where we have
[1:24:05] to be right here right here because god
[1:24:08] wants to help us with something
[1:24:10] i know he does i'm sure of that i'm
[1:24:12] convinced of that
[1:24:13] so i want you to to not focus so much on
[1:24:17] the natural part of this as we would the
[1:24:20] spiritual part of this because the
[1:24:22] churches of our world today are also
[1:24:25] committing this same kind of spiritual
[1:24:28] adultery because many of them are
[1:24:30] embracing ideas that do not have their
[1:24:34] foundation in the word of god so they're
[1:24:36] an alternative truth they're an
[1:24:38] alternative seed not of the original not
[1:24:42] of the thoughts of god not of the zoe
[1:24:44] life of god but some kind of imitation
[1:24:47] or a substitute or an imitation and the
[1:24:50] enemy is always there trying to insert
[1:24:54] that into the mind of people and when
[1:24:58] you receive that in order to receive the
[1:25:01] faults the seed of discrepancy you have
[1:25:04] to reject the truth
[1:25:07] that's what makes it adultery
[1:25:10] that's what makes it a form of adultery
[1:25:12] you are rejecting your own husband the
[1:25:14] word
[1:25:14] to believe a lie
[1:25:16] to believe a counter-truth an
[1:25:19] alternative truth and in doing so
[1:25:21] there's only one spirit that can follow
[1:25:23] that kind of behavior it's confusion
[1:25:27] the spirit of this age
[1:25:30] laodicea is about people's rights
[1:25:35] we know that from the scripture
[1:25:37] it's the day the age of people's rights
[1:25:39] and isn't that what everybody is so
[1:25:42] tremendously disturbed about in our
[1:25:44] nation even now i want to say i don't
[1:25:48] care what cost me i want to say thanks
[1:25:50] be to god that a 50 year old wrong has
[1:25:53] been made right in this nation
[1:25:56] yes
[1:25:57] and when we say that we we don't even
[1:26:00] have to say it from a scriptural
[1:26:01] standpoint we can say from a
[1:26:03] constitutional standpoint
[1:26:05] our constitution has once again been
[1:26:06] honored we don't get to just write
[1:26:08] things and make them up as we go along
[1:26:10] we have an obligation to stay with the
[1:26:12] constitution of this nation and i am
[1:26:15] appalled at some of the comments that
[1:26:16] people start making and you know some of
[1:26:18] the little things that capture my
[1:26:20] attention so much over the course of the
[1:26:22] last few days is simply this have you
[1:26:24] ever seen an hour where people were so
[1:26:27] upset about saving innocent lives
[1:26:33] saving innocent life
[1:26:34] have you ever thought you'd be living in
[1:26:36] an hour where people would be more
[1:26:37] concerned about saving a dog
[1:26:43] a pet
[1:26:45] than they are human life
[1:26:47] i tell you that is a real confusion
[1:26:49] isn't it what a spirit of confusion in
[1:26:52] our land today people posting all the
[1:26:54] time all the time don't forget it's hot
[1:26:56] remember your dogs there's nothing wrong
[1:26:57] with that it's right it's right why
[1:26:59] don't you take just a little bit of your
[1:27:00] influence every now and again and say
[1:27:04] as some of you have
[1:27:06] lives are sacred
[1:27:07] let's not forget the unborn
[1:27:10] remember i asked the lord some years ago
[1:27:12] before an election what is on your heart
[1:27:15] what are the things that matter to you
[1:27:17] now now you can say god doesn't care
[1:27:19] anything about politics well i'm just
[1:27:20] telling you what i asked him
[1:27:22] i said lord what is on your heart and he
[1:27:24] gave me the list
[1:27:26] of things that meant the most to him in
[1:27:27] that moment
[1:27:29] one of them was the sanctity of human
[1:27:31] life
[1:27:32] the second one was the sanctity of human
[1:27:34] marriage
[1:27:35] real biblical concept of marriage one
[1:27:38] man one woman for life
[1:27:41] that's the bible concept
[1:27:44] and then carrying
[1:27:47] and supporting and standing by the
[1:27:49] nation of israel
[1:27:51] and you know this nation rises and falls
[1:27:54] on those three things
[1:27:56] again and again and again and again so
[1:27:58] yes we have something to thank god for
[1:28:01] we can say that a bit of the confusion
[1:28:03] has been brushed off and yes people get
[1:28:05] all upset and they're marching and
[1:28:07] they're screaming and they're rioting
[1:28:08] and they're carrying on because they're
[1:28:09] just manifesting the spirit of this age
[1:28:13] which is demanding our rights we want
[1:28:15] our rights we've got to have our right
[1:28:16] let me tell you something what about
[1:28:18] what god wants
[1:28:19] who's interested in discovering what god
[1:28:21] cares about what does he love
[1:28:24] and
[1:28:25] this is vitally important in this hour
[1:28:27] now i want you to know because i'm not
[1:28:30] going to stay on this very long i i have
[1:28:32] to move on for today but i want you to
[1:28:35] understand that caney did a good job
[1:28:38] he he didn't bring the rotten taters
[1:28:42] he brought the best taters that he had
[1:28:45] he he bought the he brought the
[1:28:47] prettiest turnips
[1:28:49] and the best squash
[1:28:51] whatever it was that had come from the
[1:28:53] fruit of his labor in the earth he
[1:28:55] brought the best of that he knew better
[1:28:57] than to bring the crooked carrot
[1:28:59] whoa his carrots were straight as a
[1:29:02] board so he brought the best of what he
[1:29:04] had to offer
[1:29:06] but but there was one thing and again
[1:29:08] we're putting aside the fact that he had
[1:29:11] a different seed right now we're looking
[1:29:13] at his offering
[1:29:15] and what kind of god
[1:29:17] would would just reject and refuse
[1:29:21] somebody bringing the best they had to
[1:29:22] offer i mean it seems a little cruel
[1:29:24] doesn't it seems a little hard to
[1:29:26] understand that god would do such a
[1:29:28] thing as that just remember that god
[1:29:30] disregarded he who he was as a person
[1:29:33] and the offering that he brought so god
[1:29:35] was looking at the seed and he was also
[1:29:38] looking on the fact that cain had no
[1:29:41] no revelation
[1:29:44] he followed the trends
[1:29:48] stay with me
[1:29:50] he followed the trends
[1:29:51] he was religious
[1:29:53] in following the trends
[1:29:56] but he had no
[1:29:57] revelation
[1:29:59] and without a revelation all that he
[1:30:02] could do would be to bring the best that
[1:30:05] he thought
[1:30:07] i i think that god should be very
[1:30:10] happy
[1:30:11] to receive these vegetables
[1:30:14] he reasoned just like his origin
[1:30:18] and and he said i just can't imagine a
[1:30:21] god that wouldn't like these carrots
[1:30:25] these are just the most amazing carrot
[1:30:26] this is the best tournament my my god's
[1:30:28] going to be so happy
[1:30:30] i want you to know he walked to the
[1:30:33] place of building an altar just like
[1:30:35] abel did with confidence
[1:30:38] that god was going to be pleased with
[1:30:40] what he had to offer there's going to be
[1:30:42] a whole lot of people that that wake up
[1:30:44] to a sad reality one day
[1:30:47] that all the years of your religious
[1:30:49] fervor have not given you one second of
[1:30:52] eternal life
[1:30:53] because eternal life doesn't come out of
[1:30:56] religious fervor or out of religious
[1:30:59] loyalty it only comes from being born
[1:31:01] again
[1:31:03] born again of the spirit of christ when
[1:31:07] we look at that in the greek we find it
[1:31:09] to be born again brother donovan what
[1:31:11] does it mean to be born again
[1:31:14] born from above
[1:31:18] isn't that wonderful news
[1:31:21] to know that even though i had a birth
[1:31:25] from below
[1:31:26] born into this earth this fallen society
[1:31:31] my mother my dad came together in
[1:31:34] intimate relationship each providing
[1:31:36] their part of the equation god breathed
[1:31:40] life
[1:31:41] into me
[1:31:44] i'm going to say a very dangerous thing
[1:31:49] even though some
[1:31:51] would have seen me
[1:31:53] as only a ball
[1:31:56] of twitching muscle and
[1:31:58] sinew
[1:32:00] because that's some people's favorite
[1:32:01] quote
[1:32:04] god saw me so much more
[1:32:10] because as the scriptures say he
[1:32:13] saw me before in fact it says he saw my
[1:32:16] unformed substance
[1:32:19] before i had nose
[1:32:22] before i had hands
[1:32:24] before i had legs
[1:32:26] way before i had eyelashes he saw me
[1:32:31] in my unformed substance
[1:32:33] in my mother's womb
[1:32:35] and he gave me a destiny he knew me he
[1:32:39] knew me he knew my name
[1:32:42] and he knew my choice
[1:32:44] and before i was ever born before i ever
[1:32:47] breathed the first breath of life on my
[1:32:50] own god already knew who i was who i was
[1:32:54] going to be
[1:32:55] my failures
[1:32:57] my sin he knew it my strengths my
[1:33:00] accomplishments my trophies he knew it
[1:33:04] and none of that had anything to do
[1:33:06] he was only looking at my choice
[1:33:09] he saw that i would choose him and
[1:33:11] because of that foreknowledge he gave me
[1:33:14] a prefix destiny that all the hordes of
[1:33:17] hell may march against but they cannot
[1:33:20] change who i am they cannot change who
[1:33:23] you are he saw you he knew you he
[1:33:27] brought you to this place in time to
[1:33:31] serve a purpose
[1:33:35] so you've got to lay every quote
[1:33:38] like every scripture
[1:33:40] in balance of the other
[1:33:42] you see my mom provided a part of who i
[1:33:45] am my dad provided a part of who i am
[1:33:48] but it was god who gave me what i really
[1:33:51] am
[1:33:52] it was god who gave me life it was god's
[1:33:55] breath who made me a living soul
[1:33:59] hallelujah
[1:34:00] and so
[1:34:01] don't forget
[1:34:03] that when my heart began to beat
[1:34:06] god already knew who i was
[1:34:11] for a mother to make such a decision
[1:34:14] that that heartbeat doesn't matter is
[1:34:17] against everything i know about the
[1:34:19] nature of god
[1:34:20] so be careful how you pick your little
[1:34:22] quotations and your little things and go
[1:34:25] forward please understand that i
[1:34:27] am
[1:34:29] compassionate and understanding of those
[1:34:32] who are in horrible circumstances of
[1:34:34] life but i am so blessed when i hear a
[1:34:37] testimony of someone who says my mother
[1:34:40] chose
[1:34:42] maybe maybe it's not a mistake that i
[1:34:44] saw bobby connor who's been right here
[1:34:46] who spoke from this place
[1:34:48] maybe it's not a mistake that his
[1:34:49] testimony was making it's it's circular
[1:34:52] again this week on social media because
[1:34:54] he probably shared some of it with us
[1:34:56] here in service if he didn't i've been
[1:34:58] with him many times in many places
[1:35:00] around the world
[1:35:01] i've spoken with bobby in singapore i've
[1:35:03] spoken with bobby and israel i've spoken
[1:35:05] with bobby in in switzerland i've spoken
[1:35:07] with him in california and in many other
[1:35:10] places and he has said to me personally
[1:35:12] that he has a memory
[1:35:15] you say i don't believe that it doesn't
[1:35:16] matter what you believe
[1:35:17] he believes it
[1:35:19] and and if he don't have anybody else to
[1:35:20] believe it i believe it
[1:35:22] he said he remembers
[1:35:24] the the effort let me just try to say it
[1:35:26] clean as possible the effort that his
[1:35:28] mother was making
[1:35:30] to try to take his life he saw the hand
[1:35:32] of god felt and experienced the hand of
[1:35:35] god in his mother's womb push him aside
[1:35:40] and hold him over to the side
[1:35:43] so that the coat hanger couldn't take
[1:35:45] his life
[1:35:47] [Laughter]
[1:35:51] somebody said i can't i can't even
[1:35:52] believe in such and so fantastical as
[1:35:54] that well then you don't know what god's
[1:35:55] purpose was in bobby connor
[1:35:58] but his purpose and his destiny god was
[1:36:00] so jealous over that
[1:36:02] that he said you will not win in taking
[1:36:05] what i have chosen
[1:36:08] and you know god is saying that let me
[1:36:09] tell you something why it's so important
[1:36:11] in this hour it's because the last seed
[1:36:13] of god has not yet been expressed in the
[1:36:15] earth
[1:36:16] you hear me gentiles the last seed of
[1:36:20] god has not yet been expressed in the
[1:36:22] earth
[1:36:23] and i don't know who it's coming through
[1:36:25] i don't know when it's going to come but
[1:36:26] one day the last seed
[1:36:30] that's going to have eternal life is
[1:36:32] going to be born into planet earth and
[1:36:35] when it does that's it
[1:36:36] the mercies of god leaving the gentiles
[1:36:38] and returning quickly to the jews
[1:36:41] because god is not a bueno who breaks
[1:36:43] his covenant with man
[1:36:44] he made a covenant with israel the
[1:36:46] people and israel the dirt
[1:36:49] and he will not break that covenant but
[1:36:52] you and i have been given this glorious
[1:36:54] opportunity as the nations the of
[1:36:57] the world to come to christ and know
[1:36:59] eternal life not as a second thought but
[1:37:01] a part of god's original plan of grace
[1:37:03] for the nations he didn't just love
[1:37:05] israel he loved israel above the other
[1:37:07] nations but he loved the earth
[1:37:09] and he loved the nations of the earth
[1:37:12] and he made a way for even the gentiles
[1:37:13] to come to god
[1:37:15] yes and we helped bring the jews in in
[1:37:17] the last days isn't that a wonderful
[1:37:19] thing god has allowed us to have a part
[1:37:21] in
[1:37:25] yes it is
[1:37:27] so uh where were we whoo
[1:37:29] uh so god did that for bobby he's done
[1:37:33] that for many
[1:37:34] uh who is this amazing blind musician
[1:37:38] i know there are many say it again
[1:37:41] other than stevie wonder i think he's
[1:37:43] marvelous no keep moving
[1:37:49] all these men are wonderful
[1:37:51] andre
[1:37:52] how do you say his last name
[1:37:54] botticelli i think i may be wrong
[1:37:57] botticelli is that right bocelli
[1:37:59] burticelli do you all know who i'm
[1:38:01] talking about
[1:38:04] spaghetti
[1:38:07] that's the only italian i know
[1:38:09] if i'm not mistaken i may be mistaken
[1:38:11] but i think there was a testimony that
[1:38:12] came out about his own life
[1:38:15] that his mother made a decision
[1:38:18] knowing that something was terribly
[1:38:19] wrong with her child she made a decision
[1:38:22] to keep him around and i think there are
[1:38:24] many other testimonies that we have
[1:38:25] heard through the years of great
[1:38:27] performers
[1:38:28] and men and women who have shined who
[1:38:31] whoever really uh seeming excelled in
[1:38:34] life
[1:38:35] who were
[1:38:37] here
[1:38:39] because someone decided
[1:38:42] broken but valuable
[1:38:48] maybe not perfect
[1:38:50] but mine
[1:38:51] and i'm going to choose
[1:38:53] for life
[1:38:55] and look what the world has received
[1:38:56] because of it now back to the garden
[1:38:59] cain is there and he is laying his
[1:39:02] sacrifice out and
[1:39:05] i was in korea preaching in the
[1:39:07] pentecostal churches and i was so amazed
[1:39:10] that at so many of the pagan practices
[1:39:12] that some of them were still carrying
[1:39:13] over into christianity
[1:39:16] and one of those pagan practices was
[1:39:18] they decorated the altar every sunday
[1:39:20] they made made like a diorama on the
[1:39:23] altar and they laid beautiful flowers
[1:39:25] and beautiful fruits and all kinds of
[1:39:27] things on the altar and they were clear
[1:39:29] in telling me that they weren't giving
[1:39:31] them to god they were just beautifying
[1:39:33] the worship atmosphere
[1:39:35] and
[1:39:36] they also rang a bell to bring the holy
[1:39:38] spirit in and they rang a bell to
[1:39:40] dismiss him
[1:39:43] and i just i just enjoyed their
[1:39:45] traditions the best i could because i
[1:39:47] like kimchi
[1:39:49] you'll do a lot of things for kimchi
[1:39:51] but as i began to be more familiar with
[1:39:53] them i
[1:39:55] i realized that i had a little authority
[1:39:57] i had a little voice in their life and
[1:39:59] so i waited to that part of the service
[1:40:01] when they were gonna ring the bell to
[1:40:02] send the holy spirit out and i said stop
[1:40:08] a very orderly service
[1:40:11] and i was the one who screamed this day
[1:40:13] the scripture is fulfilled in your ears
[1:40:15] i said stop
[1:40:17] and and they all look the pastor it's
[1:40:20] name i remember his name today was iwan
[1:40:22] bark he was the leader of the assemblies
[1:40:24] of god
[1:40:26] in korea
[1:40:27] he was dr cho's pastor
[1:40:30] he was the one dr cho answered to
[1:40:33] and he said
[1:40:35] reverend stephen what what in the world
[1:40:36] is wrong
[1:40:37] and i said i just can't stand to see him
[1:40:40] go
[1:40:44] i've enjoyed him being here so much
[1:40:47] until i just can't stand the thought of
[1:40:50] sending him back out into eternity
[1:40:52] somewhere let's stay a while and worship
[1:40:55] god and enjoy the presence of the holy
[1:40:58] spirit
[1:41:00] i have a card in my desk
[1:41:02] where where
[1:41:04] that where pastor ewan bart wrote me
[1:41:06] later and he said i want you to know we
[1:41:08] have now stopped the ringing of the bell
[1:41:11] at the end of the service he said we
[1:41:13] still ring it in to make sure he's
[1:41:15] welcome
[1:41:18] but we don't ring it at the end to send
[1:41:20] him out
[1:41:21] too
[1:41:22] many churches dismiss the holy ghost
[1:41:26] just before he has an opportunity to do
[1:41:30] what he has come to do
[1:41:32] let's not do that
[1:41:35] let's welcome him here
[1:41:39] oh god made this eagle's refuge holy
[1:41:42] this campground
[1:41:44] new hope revival ministries may it
[1:41:47] always be a place where the holy ghost
[1:41:51] is welcome to come
[1:41:54] to stay with us as long as he will to
[1:41:57] move among us
[1:41:59] as he desires
[1:42:01] bless the name of jesus
[1:42:04] so cain is doing it he's decorating he's
[1:42:07] laying the carrots in a row he's making
[1:42:09] it beautiful
[1:42:12] can i have a little water i'm screaming
[1:42:15] i need some support
[1:42:21] and the prophet tells us
[1:42:24] abel
[1:42:25] was a loving shepherd he cared for his
[1:42:28] sheep
[1:42:30] but there was one
[1:42:34] he had a pet lamb
[1:42:37] he had one that he loved above the
[1:42:38] others
[1:42:40] and when it come time to offer an
[1:42:42] offering to god
[1:42:44] he wanted to give god something that
[1:42:47] meant
[1:42:48] something to him
[1:42:50] cain couldn't care less about the
[1:42:52] carrots
[1:42:53] he was proud of him because he'd done a
[1:42:54] good job growing them but oh abel loved
[1:42:57] the slam this was the sweetest lamb the
[1:43:00] most special lamb the most beautiful
[1:43:02] eyes of any lamb
[1:43:04] that abel had ever raised in his flock
[1:43:07] and when it came time to build an altar
[1:43:09] and offer a sacrifice to god he didn't
[1:43:11] want to give god just one of the crowd
[1:43:14] just one of the group he wanted to bring
[1:43:16] to god something that meant so much to
[1:43:19] him
[1:43:21] why would he do
[1:43:22] that why would he do that it's real
[1:43:25] simple
[1:43:27] abel had a revelation
[1:43:29] that one day the blood
[1:43:32] of an innocent lamb was going to cry out
[1:43:35] on behalf of the sins of the entire
[1:43:38] world the bible calls him a prophet
[1:43:43] he was prophetic in the sense that he
[1:43:46] caught a revelation of how my redemption
[1:43:49] was going to come and he was a type
[1:43:54] of what was to come the innocent
[1:43:57] spotless lamb of god behold the lamb of
[1:44:00] god that taketh away the sin of the
[1:44:02] world out from the midst of the of the
[1:44:04] throne came a lamb as it had been slain
[1:44:07] from the very foundation of the world
[1:44:09] and abel caught up
[1:44:13] oh
[1:44:16] abel got
[1:44:21] english is my language of choice
[1:44:25] he got caught up
[1:44:28] in the glory of the revelation
[1:44:31] and he said if my offering is going to
[1:44:34] be a
[1:44:36] a type
[1:44:37] a symbol
[1:44:38] of the offering
[1:44:41] if my little lamb is going to be a
[1:44:44] prophetic representation of the great
[1:44:48] lamb of god
[1:44:50] powerful
[1:44:52] then it must be the finest
[1:44:55] lamb
[1:44:57] the most beautiful thank you son the
[1:45:00] most beautiful lamb and it must be the
[1:45:03] one that means the most to me
[1:45:06] brother branham said he strips down a
[1:45:09] grape vine
[1:45:10] rips it down off the vine and he begins
[1:45:13] to make himself a little rope
[1:45:17] braids him a little rope and he ties
[1:45:19] that rope around the little lamb's neck
[1:45:23] and he begins to lead him over to the
[1:45:25] altar that he has built
[1:45:28] and he sits down around that altar and
[1:45:30] he lays that lamb down and how many of
[1:45:33] you know if a little animal like that
[1:45:35] doesn't want to lay down he's going to
[1:45:36] try it's best to get up again
[1:45:39] and he's just trying his best without
[1:45:41] being cruel you say cruel he's about to
[1:45:43] kill the lamb please understand
[1:45:48] if that lamb could no more redeem and
[1:45:51] cleanse abel
[1:45:54] it's not that animal life
[1:45:57] that was going to bring able to complete
[1:45:59] redemption but this was a shadow of what
[1:46:02] was to come under the law of moses that
[1:46:04] provided a covering for sin
[1:46:07] that would later lead to a total
[1:46:09] remission of sin when the blood of the
[1:46:10] spotless lamb of calvary was shed you
[1:46:13] follow the type right
[1:46:15] he lays sets down and he lays that
[1:46:19] uh
[1:46:19] lamb down on the
[1:46:21] on the ledge or the edge of that altar
[1:46:24] and there is no sharp knife are you with
[1:46:26] me there is no smith there is no sharp
[1:46:29] knife but the branham said he just picks
[1:46:31] up a a jagged rock
[1:46:34] and he says i've got to make this as
[1:46:36] quick
[1:46:37] and as painless as possible somebody
[1:46:39] said when you tell stories like that it
[1:46:41] turned my stomach i hope it turned your
[1:46:43] stomach so many ways
[1:46:49] i i do i hope i hope that you have to
[1:46:52] swallow
[1:46:54] before i'm through telling it
[1:46:56] because i want you to understand the
[1:46:59] magnitude of the revelation that abel
[1:47:02] had received
[1:47:04] and then i want to tell you how do you
[1:47:06] and i think that we can get by in this
[1:47:09] last hour without a revelation how can
[1:47:12] we survive how can we overcome without a
[1:47:16] personal revelation of the lamb of
[1:47:18] calvary and what he has done for us how
[1:47:20] can we live without the power of the
[1:47:22] holy ghost within us how can we keep
[1:47:24] moving on without total deliverance when
[1:47:27] it's promised to us in the same
[1:47:29] sacrifice
[1:47:32] and so as quickly as possible jennifer
[1:47:36] he takes that jagged rock
[1:47:38] he takes one to hand
[1:47:40] and he begins to feel
[1:47:45] with his left hand
[1:47:47] he's feeling the neck of that lamb to
[1:47:49] find the jugular vein
[1:47:51] and with the right hand he raises that
[1:47:53] sharp jagged rock and with just two or
[1:47:56] three strikes
[1:48:02] he rips through the hide
[1:48:06] through the through the
[1:48:07] fire
[1:48:09] the fleece i'll get it right in a minute
[1:48:11] the fleece of the lamb
[1:48:13] he rips through the skin
[1:48:16] of the lamb
[1:48:17] he begins to tear through the muscle
[1:48:19] tissue of the lamb
[1:48:21] and he reaches that jugular vein
[1:48:24] and with one thrash of a jagged rock
[1:48:28] he severs the jugular vein
[1:48:31] all the while
[1:48:33] bathing himself
[1:48:37] don't you see it like a little sprinkle
[1:48:40] the jugular vein doesn't sprinkle blood
[1:48:43] megan has worked as a nurse in the
[1:48:45] surgical unit of a hospital and she can
[1:48:47] tell you what happens
[1:48:49] when you get a major
[1:48:51] like that it just every time that little
[1:48:53] lamb's
[1:48:54] heart would take a beat the blood would
[1:48:57] thrust from that severed jugular vein
[1:49:00] like a fountain
[1:49:02] whoa
[1:49:04] bathing
[1:49:06] the altar
[1:49:08] bathing the ground around the altar
[1:49:12] and more importantly than that bathing
[1:49:15] abel
[1:49:19] in the blood
[1:49:23] [Music]
[1:49:25] bathing able
[1:49:27] in the blood of his own offering
[1:49:29] of his own sacrifice how could god
[1:49:33] have been moved by the blood of a turnip
[1:49:37] come on
[1:49:40] i used to preach under the tents
[1:49:42] you can't get blood out of a turnip
[1:49:46] how could that juice veggie juice
[1:49:49] have moved god
[1:49:51] when he was giving a revelation that it
[1:49:53] had to be blood
[1:49:55] and this blood would only be a covering
[1:49:59] and a type with antitype
[1:50:01] of the reality of the real blood that
[1:50:04] was going how did abel how did abel know
[1:50:06] brother branham said that adam and eve
[1:50:09] they picked their children up
[1:50:12] they put them on their knee they told
[1:50:13] them the stories of god and how he had
[1:50:15] come down in the cool of the day and how
[1:50:17] these things had happened
[1:50:20] cain heard the same stories
[1:50:22] that abel heard
[1:50:25] cain heard the same sermons
[1:50:30] cain attended the same services
[1:50:32] sung the same songs
[1:50:34] went through all the religious program
[1:50:36] that abel went through
[1:50:39] but he did not have a revelation
[1:50:42] of where the blood is
[1:50:44] what the blood does
[1:50:46] he did not have a revelation of what had
[1:50:48] to be shed now listen was it unfair of
[1:50:50] god to expect something
[1:50:52] let me tell you something he had heard
[1:50:54] cain had heard how god himself came down
[1:50:56] in genesis 3
[1:51:00] when adam and eve had sinned discovered
[1:51:02] their nakedness and god came down in the
[1:51:04] cool of the day to visit with them again
[1:51:07] this time instead of adam and eve being
[1:51:08] standing standing there waiting to
[1:51:10] receive their guests they're hiding over
[1:51:12] there in the bushes naked who told you
[1:51:14] you're naked they'd been naked all along
[1:51:17] but now they were no longer covered with
[1:51:19] the glory light
[1:51:21] of god's great creation
[1:51:24] he created them
[1:51:25] with with coverings of light
[1:51:28] how do you know because i've seen them
[1:51:31] that he covered them with with glory and
[1:51:34] light like garments
[1:51:37] so that their nakedness they had no idea
[1:51:40] because through that through that they
[1:51:42] saw one another through the glory
[1:51:44] that covered them it's an amazing thing
[1:51:46] and now that is gone in the in the
[1:51:48] disobedience it's gone
[1:51:51] and they're standing there hiding from
[1:51:52] god because they think the father has
[1:51:54] come down to kill him
[1:51:56] now i want to tell you emphatically that
[1:51:58] papa did not come to kill them he came
[1:52:02] to clothe him
[1:52:05] amen
[1:52:07] he came to cover up their sin
[1:52:10] to cover up their nakedness and the
[1:52:12] bible said that he slayed the lamb he
[1:52:14] slayed the animals
[1:52:16] god himself slew the animals and made
[1:52:20] them coats of skin
[1:52:22] and cain and abel heard the stories
[1:52:24] both of them heard how god himself had
[1:52:27] come and made these clothes of skin for
[1:52:30] adam and eve to wear to cover their
[1:52:32] nakedness but but abel when he heard
[1:52:34] that story something within his inner
[1:52:37] being the seed of god lived within him
[1:52:40] whoa
[1:52:41] abel said hey there's a whole lot more
[1:52:43] to this story
[1:52:45] and cain said you know his mind is
[1:52:47] thinking oh how disgusting can you
[1:52:49] imagine walking around with bloody hides
[1:52:52] bloody skin slapping against your legs
[1:52:54] can you imagine putting on something
[1:52:55] filthy like that and walking around
[1:52:57] calling yourself in the presence of god
[1:52:59] but i'm not able are you awake
[1:53:02] not able
[1:53:03] he said this is the most glorious thing
[1:53:05] i've ever heard in all my life and
[1:53:06] that's why when it came time to praise
[1:53:09] when it came time to worship when it
[1:53:11] came time to give god an offering abel
[1:53:12] knew what to give him
[1:53:18] and cain didn't know what to give him
[1:53:21] there's a lot of cain still trying to
[1:53:22] give god something
[1:53:24] force him to take it force him to accept
[1:53:26] it force him to receive it he didn't
[1:53:28] want anything to do with him
[1:53:30] now i want you to look at hebrews 11 1.
[1:53:32] we've got to hurry it's already 10 to 1.
[1:53:35] and i have to move on i want you to look
[1:53:36] at hebrews 11 1 now faith
[1:53:39] is the substance
[1:53:42] i want you to understand that faith is
[1:53:44] not an emotion
[1:53:47] it's not just a feeling
[1:53:50] it's not something like a cloud or a
[1:53:52] mist or oh no no faith is the substance
[1:53:58] of things hoped for
[1:54:00] and it is the evidence
[1:54:03] of things not seen
[1:54:06] when you know
[1:54:07] that you know that you know that you
[1:54:10] possess the evidence of things that you
[1:54:12] cannot see with your natural eye that's
[1:54:14] faith
[1:54:15] and when you know that you hold the
[1:54:17] substance of things in your spiritual
[1:54:20] hand that you can only hope for in your
[1:54:22] heart
[1:54:25] that's faith
[1:54:27] and when you like a bulldog grab a hold
[1:54:29] of the promise of god
[1:54:31] and even though there is no change in
[1:54:34] the circumstance and there are no
[1:54:36] changes in the situation
[1:54:38] you are holding on to a promise holding
[1:54:41] on to the substance of a promise holding
[1:54:42] on to the evidence of things that you
[1:54:44] can't see but you will not let go you
[1:54:46] have put your teeth down you've let that
[1:54:49] jaw like the bulldog's jaw you let the
[1:54:51] bone slip down in the dip you you've
[1:54:53] locked down in there and you're holding
[1:54:55] on and you're that's faith
[1:54:59] you that say i believe god one day for
[1:55:01] something and the next day you're not
[1:55:03] sure that's not faith
[1:55:06] that's wishy-washy
[1:55:07] that's that's not even as good as the
[1:55:09] faith that we can bring
[1:55:10] you know kind of conjure up in our own
[1:55:12] intellect in our own mind we're talking
[1:55:14] about a faith that says i don't care
[1:55:16] what it looks like i don't care what it
[1:55:17] smells like come on stay away i don't
[1:55:20] care what it sounds like
[1:55:22] god said it i believe it
[1:55:24] it's settled
[1:55:27] whether i believe it or not it's settled
[1:55:29] because god said it i want you to go
[1:55:32] with me to the mount of olives
[1:55:34] i know i don't know why some of you are
[1:55:35] so sleepy this morning we're up too late
[1:55:37] or something i'm not sure
[1:55:40] my i can't sleep i've got a job to do
[1:55:42] so you try to stay awake and help me do
[1:55:44] it
[1:55:45] matthew chapter 26. i got plenty of
[1:55:47] things i could be doing just to be
[1:55:48] honest with you
[1:55:49] i i still got a lot of things that need
[1:55:51] to be done before i leave on an airplane
[1:55:52] tomorrow but i didn't want to be nowhere
[1:55:54] else
[1:55:55] i wanted to be here i want to give god
[1:55:57] thanks for every one of you that are
[1:55:58] here today i want to especially thank
[1:56:01] luke and brother luke and sister megan
[1:56:03] for being here in the service leaving
[1:56:05] after the service driving to texas
[1:56:07] and i appreciate that they would do that
[1:56:09] that way they could have left early when
[1:56:10] the kids were still sleepy but they had
[1:56:12] a desire to come and be a support and
[1:56:15] help this morning i appreciate that very
[1:56:17] very much and all of the rest of you
[1:56:19] that are here that will be leaving later
[1:56:20] in the week i appreciate it so much
[1:56:22] matthew chapter 26
[1:56:24] beginning in verse 30.
[1:56:26] if we get too sleepy then i won't go too
[1:56:28] far into this but i'll try to get a
[1:56:29] little of it out and when they had sung
[1:56:32] of hymn
[1:56:33] they went out into the mount of olives
[1:56:37] and then saith jesus unto them all ye
[1:56:40] shall be offended because of me this
[1:56:42] night
[1:56:43] for it is written
[1:56:45] i will smite the shepherd
[1:56:48] and the sheep of the flock
[1:56:50] shall be scattered abroad
[1:56:53] but after i'm risen again
[1:56:55] i will go before you
[1:56:58] into galilee
[1:57:00] you see they knew
[1:57:04] they knew
[1:57:07] they have no excuse for not knowing
[1:57:10] they knew he said he was going to raise
[1:57:11] again
[1:57:12] they knew he said he was going to meet
[1:57:14] them in the galilee they knew it
[1:57:17] they just let carnality get a hold of
[1:57:18] him when he died when they saw the
[1:57:20] brutality of his death they let they let
[1:57:23] faith slip
[1:57:25] they let carnality rise up in them and
[1:57:27] they said how can it be it's gone
[1:57:28] they'll never be back
[1:57:30] they forgot about his words but after
[1:57:32] i'm risen again i will go before you
[1:57:34] into galilee what a promise
[1:57:37] and peter answereth and saith unto him
[1:57:39] and said unto him though all men i want
[1:57:42] you to listen peters
[1:57:46] i want every one of you peters to listen
[1:57:48] peter answered and said unto him though
[1:57:51] all men
[1:57:52] shall be offended because of thee
[1:57:54] yet will i
[1:57:57] never
[1:57:58] be
[1:57:59] offended
[1:58:03] i don't care what others do i'll never
[1:58:04] leave my church i don't care what others
[1:58:07] do i'll never leave my pastor
[1:58:09] i don't care what other listen folks
[1:58:11] it sounds good and you mean it at the
[1:58:13] moment
[1:58:14] so did peter
[1:58:17] though all men shall be offended because
[1:58:19] of thee yet will i never be
[1:58:23] offended
[1:58:25] you believe peter meant what he said
[1:58:28] i do
[1:58:30] i believe he meant what he's saying
[1:58:34] jesus said unto him verily
[1:58:36] i say unto thee that this night
[1:58:39] before the crow
[1:58:41] thou shalt deny me thrice
[1:58:44] three times
[1:58:46] and peter said unto him though i should
[1:58:48] die
[1:58:49] with thee
[1:58:51] yet will i not
[1:58:53] deny thee
[1:58:55] likewise also
[1:58:57] said you read it for me
[1:59:04] all
[1:59:07] the disciples
[1:59:10] peter led them
[1:59:12] i'll never be offended with you lord
[1:59:15] everything you say i'm i embrace it and
[1:59:18] everywhere you go i'm going with you and
[1:59:21] and all the disciples they thought that
[1:59:23] sounded so good
[1:59:25] that they jumped right in and they said
[1:59:26] yes yes yes
[1:59:28] we feel the same way
[1:59:30] we'll never never never
[1:59:32] be offended with you we will not deny
[1:59:34] you
[1:59:36] jesus goes on to say
[1:59:38] well that's all for now
[1:59:42] peter could not believe
[1:59:45] that he could possibly be the one
[1:59:48] that would deny the lord
[1:59:50] in that moment he could only see his
[1:59:53] strength
[1:59:54] he could only see his resolve
[1:59:56] his own will not to deny
[2:00:00] he did not have the faith necessary to
[2:00:03] live out his confession
[2:00:06] because there's two kinds of faith
[2:00:10] he had faith in his ability to make the
[2:00:12] right choice
[2:00:14] he had faith in his ability to stand
[2:00:17] when things got tough when things got
[2:00:19] rough but he didn't know just how rough
[2:00:21] it was going to be and he didn't know
[2:00:23] the circumstances that were about to
[2:00:24] unfold he did not fully understand what
[2:00:28] was to come
[2:00:29] i want to read luke 22. i've read these
[2:00:32] verses in this context to you before but
[2:00:34] i want you to hear them again
[2:00:36] in luke chapter 22 verse 31-34
[2:00:40] jesus had already thus spoken this to
[2:00:42] peter peter had already heard what i'm
[2:00:45] about to read
[2:00:47] and the lord said simon simon behold
[2:00:50] satan hath desired to have you that he
[2:00:52] may sift you as sweet but i have prayed
[2:00:54] for thee that thy faith fail not and
[2:00:56] when thou art converted
[2:00:59] strengthen thy brethren
[2:01:01] and he said unto him lord i am ready to
[2:01:04] go with thee both into prison and what
[2:01:06] else did he say and to death
[2:01:09] and he said i tell thee peter the
[2:01:11] shall not crow this day before that thou
[2:01:13] shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me
[2:01:17] peter's clear i'll go all the way to the
[2:01:19] death i'll go to prison i'll go all the
[2:01:21] way to the death i'm determined that
[2:01:23] never to betray you never to fail you
[2:01:27] now the reason why peter had never
[2:01:29] failed in this manner before is because
[2:01:31] he had never been faced with that
[2:01:33] situation or with these particular
[2:01:35] circumstances before in his life new
[2:01:38] situations and new circumstances can
[2:01:40] often put us in a vulnerable place
[2:01:44] and in those moments of new
[2:01:46] circumstances and new temptations and
[2:01:49] new testings and new siftings and
[2:01:51] shiftings it's in that moment that we
[2:01:54] must never rely
[2:01:57] on what we think we know
[2:02:00] about who we are
[2:02:04] we must always rely on what we know
[2:02:09] not what we think we know but what we
[2:02:11] know and what we know
[2:02:13] comes by
[2:02:15] by revelation
[2:02:17] doesn't come by instruction
[2:02:20] doesn't come by education
[2:02:22] it doesn't come by more information
[2:02:25] it only comes by revelation i know that
[2:02:29] i know that i know that i know that i
[2:02:31] know that i know
[2:02:33] you know we sometimes say i don't care
[2:02:35] how bad it gets
[2:02:38] i don't care what they do i don't care
[2:02:40] what what happens as they begin to set
[2:02:42] up the mark of the beast just just as
[2:02:44] we're getting ready to leave here i
[2:02:46] don't care how our freedoms are taken
[2:02:48] away i i know what i'll do i know i'll
[2:02:50] stand
[2:02:53] we we all like to think that if you know
[2:02:55] someone soldiers or someone should come
[2:02:57] in today with a loaded weapon and say
[2:02:59] will you deny
[2:03:02] we like to all think that we have right
[2:03:05] now the resolve
[2:03:07] that it takes to stand
[2:03:10] and to say no matter what you can take
[2:03:12] my life
[2:03:13] you can lay my head on the chopping
[2:03:15] block and chop it off you can shoot a
[2:03:17] bullet through my heart but i will never
[2:03:20] deny that jesus is my lord and savior
[2:03:22] every one of us would like to believe
[2:03:25] and we think we know about ourselves
[2:03:29] that we possess
[2:03:30] the strength the courage the fortitude
[2:03:33] the power
[2:03:35] the guts excuse me
[2:03:39] to say no matter what you say no matter
[2:03:40] what you do i will never deny him peter
[2:03:43] was the same
[2:03:45] no matter what happened i'll go to
[2:03:47] prison i'll go all the way i'll never
[2:03:49] leave you i'll never be offended at you
[2:03:51] i'll always stand for you
[2:03:54] peter liked to think that he would be
[2:03:56] always what he should be
[2:03:59] what he was supposed to be you and i
[2:04:01] would like to think the same thing about
[2:04:03] ourselves but there's only one way to
[2:04:05] ever really know isn't there
[2:04:07] and that's to come down to be tested
[2:04:13] somebody said well when is that going to
[2:04:15] happen it's already happening
[2:04:17] you're already standing before the
[2:04:19] judgment seat of christ
[2:04:20] the only judgment seat you'll ever stand
[2:04:22] before is the bride of christ is the one
[2:04:24] you're standing before now you're
[2:04:26] already being sifted and tempted and
[2:04:27] tested
[2:04:29] the word is already trying you in this
[2:04:31] hour
[2:04:32] somebody said well nobody has a bullet
[2:04:33] to my head and asking me to deny no
[2:04:37] but when you check your receipt and find
[2:04:39] out that you haven't paid for all your
[2:04:41] items
[2:04:45] and you don't make the extra effort to
[2:04:47] go back and make it right
[2:04:49] you're failing the test
[2:04:54] when you pick up something that's not
[2:04:55] yours without any regard for who it
[2:04:57] belongs to you
[2:05:00] you're failing the test
[2:05:02] when you cheat
[2:05:04] when you lie when you when you when you
[2:05:07] uh show yourself uh in some false way
[2:05:11] portray yourself in some false way spend
[2:05:14] all your time bragging about how how
[2:05:16] good you are and how wonderful you are
[2:05:17] and knowing all along that you're living
[2:05:20] a secret life
[2:05:23] double life
[2:05:27] you're failing the test
[2:05:30] you say who are you preaching to anyone
[2:05:33] who can relate to the words that's
[2:05:34] coming out of my mouth
[2:05:36] when you happen to be watching something
[2:05:37] and you don't take the time to turn off
[2:05:39] the vulgar to rush through the vulgar or
[2:05:41] to get rid of the vulgar or to shut the
[2:05:43] whole thing off altogether every time
[2:05:45] every time you make the wrong decision
[2:05:48] you're being tested
[2:05:50] you're being tried
[2:05:51] and so when we get to thinking so good
[2:05:53] about ourselves
[2:05:55] come on now
[2:05:57] when we click on the click bait we know
[2:05:59] we're not supposed to click there we
[2:06:00] know exactly the danger we know exactly
[2:06:03] what could possibly happen when we do it
[2:06:04] but we do it anyway
[2:06:07] we're being tested now we're being tried
[2:06:09] now we're being judged now by the word
[2:06:13] the bride doesn't stand before the great
[2:06:14] white throne judgment of the lord jesus
[2:06:16] christ
[2:06:18] we're being judged even now by the
[2:06:20] things that we face in our life
[2:06:22] when somebody cuts us off in traffic
[2:06:30] all the things that happen where our
[2:06:32] morality and our integrity and our
[2:06:35] honesty
[2:06:37] our uprightness is being tested and we
[2:06:40] don't choose to take the high road
[2:06:42] we're failing in those things
[2:06:44] we need not think we possess the courage
[2:06:47] necessary to stand in the hour that the
[2:06:49] gun
[2:06:53] when there's a discussion going on and
[2:06:55] and you're almost a part of the
[2:06:57] discussion and you just let it continue
[2:06:59] on without ever speaking up for the name
[2:07:01] of christ
[2:07:06] somebody damning god's name
[2:07:09] and you don't take the opportunity
[2:07:12] a man
[2:07:13] women you better not
[2:07:15] but a man had the opportunity to become
[2:07:17] say i sure wish you wouldn't say that
[2:07:18] about my lord i've said it hundreds of
[2:07:21] times in my life i sure wished you
[2:07:23] wouldn't talk about my lord that way
[2:07:25] [Music]
[2:07:27] i've embarrassed my own family before
[2:07:29] because sometimes they're big and
[2:07:31] burlier and meaner and look like they
[2:07:33] could
[2:07:34] pinch my head off
[2:07:35] just pluck it off like a worm's head but
[2:07:37] i want you to know there are just times
[2:07:39] that we just cannot be silent
[2:07:42] i've turned around in booths and said
[2:07:44] fellas i wish you all wouldn't talk like
[2:07:46] that in front of my wife my wife is a
[2:07:47] lady i wish you all wouldn't talk that
[2:07:49] way there with their wife sitting right
[2:07:51] beside them
[2:07:54] i don't think that you ought to go
[2:07:56] looking for trouble
[2:07:58] i think you should only speak up when
[2:08:00] you know that it's the right opportunity
[2:08:03] and the right moment to do it it'll be
[2:08:04] an impact
[2:08:05] you see i remember sitting on the beach
[2:08:07] one time with my kids
[2:08:09] we were dressed decent and we had no
[2:08:11] idea that there was going to be a time
[2:08:13] that that there would be a lot of school
[2:08:15] kids there and behind us that big large
[2:08:17] group of college kids were there and
[2:08:20] they were doing things i didn't want my
[2:08:21] children to see and saying things i
[2:08:23] didn't want my children to know anything
[2:08:24] about and we were just about ready to
[2:08:26] pack up and leave and all of a sudden i
[2:08:28] thought wait a minute
[2:08:30] this is my beach
[2:08:32] my god created this he gave this to me
[2:08:35] for beauty
[2:08:38] and i just got up my wife hollering down
[2:08:40] please don't please don't do that please
[2:08:41] don't do that please don't do that the
[2:08:43] children cry don't don't no no daddy
[2:08:45] don't go
[2:08:46] and i said do i do do you think i'm
[2:08:48] gonna look intimidating
[2:08:50] you'll see all those guys they can knock
[2:08:52] me down without any trouble
[2:08:54] and they may
[2:08:56] but i'm going to go down telling them
[2:08:57] that they ought not to talk like that
[2:08:59] and i walked back up and i said excuse
[2:09:01] me folks took me a while to get their
[2:09:02] attention because they're having such a
[2:09:03] good time excuse me all a lot of girls
[2:09:06] on boys
[2:09:07] my family is just right there and we
[2:09:08] were first
[2:09:10] we got there first we're just just right
[2:09:12] ahead of you all
[2:09:13] and and we know this is public and we
[2:09:15] know everybody has a right to hear but
[2:09:17] your language is so offensive my wife
[2:09:19] has never heard language like that my
[2:09:21] children particularly have never heard
[2:09:23] words likes coming out of your mouth i
[2:09:24] would so much appreciate it if you all
[2:09:26] would tone it down have a good time
[2:09:28] enjoy life enjoy yourself
[2:09:30] but could you do it just a little more
[2:09:32] respectful of the others around you we
[2:09:34] don't talk like that and we don't do
[2:09:35] those things
[2:09:36] and you know what one by one of course
[2:09:38] they're stunned first i've told this
[2:09:40] before they're first they're all going
[2:09:45] with everything in them they wanted to
[2:09:47] curse with everything in them they
[2:09:49] wanted to be mad at me and tell me where
[2:09:51] i could go and what i could do
[2:09:53] but they couldn't
[2:09:55] because they were arrested
[2:09:58] and my wife can tell you before the day
[2:10:00] was over here come one of them down he
[2:10:01] said would you all mind just a college
[2:10:03] kid would you all mind if i sat with you
[2:10:05] all for a while i said no go ahead
[2:10:07] there's a chair right there yeah help
[2:10:08] yourself
[2:10:09] he said my daddy's a church of god
[2:10:11] preacher
[2:10:14] he said i know he'd be ashamed of me
[2:10:16] if he knew what i was doing down here
[2:10:18] how i'd been acting he said your words
[2:10:20] cut through me like a knife
[2:10:22] listen
[2:10:23] that was not me just trying to be ugly
[2:10:26] because sometimes you've got this
[2:10:28] feeling that you want to just be
[2:10:29] invisible in a moment like that i've had
[2:10:32] it you don't want to say nothing you
[2:10:33] don't rock the boat you don't want to be
[2:10:35] shot
[2:10:37] but in that moment where you know that
[2:10:39] you've got to speak up for what is right
[2:10:42] i just had to in that moment and so glad
[2:10:45] i did
[2:10:47] because when that young man finally left
[2:10:49] us that evening afternoon he said pray
[2:10:52] for me
[2:10:54] i don't want my daddy to be ashamed of
[2:10:55] me neither do i want to stand before god
[2:10:58] and have him to be ashamed of me one day
[2:11:01] look folk
[2:11:02] we're living in a world where tolerance
[2:11:04] is what's preached but there's just so
[2:11:07] much of that that we can we can live
[2:11:09] with there's just so much of that we can
[2:11:10] take and then there's those moments that
[2:11:13] we have to stand up for what we know is
[2:11:15] right
[2:11:16] peter thought he had what it took
[2:11:18] because he had a mental concept of faith
[2:11:21] he had an intellectual faith in his
[2:11:24] ability to stand but he did not have
[2:11:27] what it takes from on high to come down
[2:11:29] and anoint that faith with the
[2:11:30] revelation
[2:11:32] oh no he didn't
[2:11:33] i said a moment ago let me just read my
[2:11:35] notes the reason why peter never failed
[2:11:37] in this manner before is because he had
[2:11:39] never been faced with this situation or
[2:11:41] these particular circumstances before
[2:11:43] new situations new circumstances can
[2:11:46] often put us in a vulnerable place in
[2:11:48] those moments we must never rely on what
[2:11:50] we think we know we must only rely on
[2:11:52] what we believe our revelation of the
[2:11:55] word by faith
[2:11:58] what do you believe my revelation on the
[2:12:00] word by faith
[2:12:02] what god has revealed to me from his
[2:12:04] word by faith i believe that by faith i
[2:12:07] accept that by faith i receive that
[2:12:11] nobody has to prove it to me
[2:12:13] my faith has chosen
[2:12:15] to embrace that because it came by
[2:12:17] revelation
[2:12:19] peter was leaning on his intellectual
[2:12:21] concept of faith and it failed him and
[2:12:23] it caused him to fall his intellectual
[2:12:26] faith was not enough to hold him but his
[2:12:29] revelation
[2:12:30] but his revelation was enough to pull
[2:12:34] him back to the truth you see he didn't
[2:12:38] have a revelation of faith like he
[2:12:40] needed but he did have a revelation
[2:12:44] matthew chapter 16 go there quickly
[2:12:49] i'm on page 2 of 20. i need to hurry
[2:12:53] when jesus came into the coast of
[2:12:54] caesarea philippi he asked his disciples
[2:12:56] saying whom to me and say that i the son
[2:12:58] of man am and they said some say they
[2:13:00] are john the baptist some elias others
[2:13:02] jeremiah or one of the prophets he saith
[2:13:04] unto them but whom say ye that i am and
[2:13:07] simon peter simon peter simon peter
[2:13:11] said thou art the christ the mashiach
[2:13:13] the anointed one the messiah the son of
[2:13:16] the living god
[2:13:18] he had a revelation
[2:13:20] he didn't have all the revelation he
[2:13:21] needed but he had a revelation
[2:13:25] and it was that revelation that pulled
[2:13:26] him back when he failed
[2:13:29] when he denied the lord i wished i had
[2:13:30] time to read it when he denied the lord
[2:13:32] and the cop the rooster told on him
[2:13:36] you know how we talk about preachers
[2:13:38] loving fried chicken
[2:13:40] because we're always trying to get
[2:13:41] revenge on the chicken for what they did
[2:13:43] tell it on peter
[2:13:46] cock-a-doodle-doo
[2:13:49] that's a sick rooster
[2:13:54] is that a little better
[2:13:56] three times
[2:13:58] as peter denied the lord
[2:14:03] in luke 22
[2:14:06] deny the lord do a little dishwasher
[2:14:09] oh yeah i know who you are your speech
[2:14:10] betrays you i don't even know what
[2:14:12] you're talking about come on
[2:14:14] he failed he lied
[2:14:16] he failed
[2:14:17] he wouldn't have made it but that
[2:14:18] revelation that he did have pulled him
[2:14:20] back until he could get the revelation
[2:14:22] that he needed to stand remember one day
[2:14:24] jesus in matthew 16 can i just give it
[2:14:26] to your notes like that you go read them
[2:14:28] in matthew 16
[2:14:30] 21-23 do you remember jesus turning to
[2:14:32] him one day i'm not going to read it but
[2:14:34] remember he turned to him what get thee
[2:14:35] behind me satan
[2:14:37] looked at peter get thee behind me satan
[2:14:40] for thou savers not the things that be
[2:14:42] of god
[2:14:44] you're not running after god like you
[2:14:46] should you're not running after
[2:14:48] revelation like you should
[2:14:51] you're spending too much time on
[2:14:52] facebook and not enough time with your
[2:14:54] face in his book
[2:14:55] come on
[2:14:57] get thee behind me
[2:14:59] you're going to have to have a little
[2:15:00] something else to be able to stand in
[2:15:02] that hour
[2:15:03] oh peter was still concerned about his
[2:15:05] reputation his standing in the community
[2:15:08] but when the rest when the rooster
[2:15:09] preached the sermon peter knew what he
[2:15:11] had done
[2:15:12] when peter needed what peter needed was
[2:15:14] the upper room he needed to be filled
[2:15:16] with the very life of god he needed
[2:15:18] jesus on the inside he had jesus around
[2:15:20] him see a lot of people had the prophet
[2:15:22] with them in the sleeping bag and in the
[2:15:24] tent and on the trip and all the
[2:15:26] wonderful hunting things all the
[2:15:27] beautiful experiences they had with
[2:15:29] random but what they needed was the god
[2:15:31] of william branham on the inside of them
[2:15:34] they needed to have in them what he had
[2:15:36] in him
[2:15:37] and it's still the same today anybody
[2:15:38] with me
[2:15:40] oh
[2:15:40] he needed power he needed power
[2:15:43] revelation to stay on the journey to
[2:15:45] stay in the word the infilling with the
[2:15:47] life of jesus leads us onward to all
[2:15:50] truth
[2:15:51] now let me let me do this before i make
[2:15:54] a quote here
[2:15:55] i wish i had time
[2:15:57] james 2 19 thou believeth that there is
[2:16:00] one god thou doest well the devils also
[2:16:02] believe in tremble
[2:16:06] did you know the devil has a better
[2:16:07] revelation of who god is than 90 of the
[2:16:10] churches in the world today
[2:16:14] because they're not sure how many gods
[2:16:15] there are
[2:16:20] he said thou believers that there is one
[2:16:22] god thou doest well the devils also
[2:16:24] believe in tremble let me tell you
[2:16:25] something the devil know how many knows
[2:16:27] how many gods there are
[2:16:29] the devil knows that baptism in the name
[2:16:31] of jesus christ is the only baptism for
[2:16:32] scripture
[2:16:35] the devil knows the new birth is not
[2:16:36] complete without the baptism of the holy
[2:16:38] ghost
[2:16:40] the devil knows that god's going to have
[2:16:41] an overcoming bride in the end time with
[2:16:43] the same signs and wonders and miracles
[2:16:45] following her that jesus talks about in
[2:16:47] mark 16.
[2:16:48] the devil knows that the devil knows
[2:16:50] that god sent a prophet a voice
[2:16:53] in the wilderness to prepare bride to
[2:16:55] call us back to the word god the devil
[2:16:56] knows that
[2:17:00] now if demons believe the bible said and
[2:17:03] devils demons believe and tremble now
[2:17:05] what kind of belief do you think devils
[2:17:07] have
[2:17:09] in order to have a belief you've got to
[2:17:10] have faith
[2:17:12] what kind of faith do devils have
[2:17:16] what kind of a belief system does a
[2:17:18] demon have he only has the knowledge
[2:17:21] that was spoken to him he only has the
[2:17:24] information he only has the knowing that
[2:17:28] has been passed to him but i tell you
[2:17:30] there's not a demon that has a
[2:17:32] revelation by the holy ghost of who god
[2:17:34] really is
[2:17:36] so this helps us to see there's a
[2:17:38] different kind of faith the kind of
[2:17:39] believing that a demon does is not the
[2:17:41] kind of believing that the bride of
[2:17:43] christ is going to be required to do in
[2:17:45] the last days anybody following me you
[2:17:47] see our faith is more than intellectual
[2:17:50] faith our faith must be more than a
[2:17:52] mental concept of faith we must have
[2:17:55] faith by revelation which only comes as
[2:17:58] an experience
[2:17:59] revelation is an experience
[2:18:02] don't tell me you don't need an
[2:18:03] experience with god revelation is an
[2:18:05] experience
[2:18:06] revelation is an encounter with god and
[2:18:09] once you receive a revelation it affects
[2:18:11] your dna
[2:18:13] both naturally and spiritually when you
[2:18:15] receive a holy ghost revelation from the
[2:18:17] lord you are never the same
[2:18:20] and so if you can be talked out of that
[2:18:22] you had a feeling but no revelation
[2:18:24] [Applause]
[2:18:25] you don't want to mistake a feeling for
[2:18:28] a revelation when you have received a
[2:18:30] revelation you are willing to reorder
[2:18:33] your whole life
[2:18:35] everything is reordered everything is
[2:18:38] rearranged and adjusted to accommodate
[2:18:41] the truth that god has quickened to your
[2:18:43] heart
[2:18:44] you leave the denominational systems and
[2:18:46] thought patterns and church age
[2:18:48] mentalities and behaviors behind
[2:18:58] it's one of the reasons why some people
[2:19:00] put all their emphasis in the church
[2:19:01] ages
[2:19:04] because that's as far with god as
[2:19:05] they're going to be able to go
[2:19:07] because they're hung up in church age
[2:19:09] mentality and behaviors the bride
[2:19:11] doesn't have a church age mentality the
[2:19:13] bride will have a bride's mentality
[2:19:15] which is the mentality of the bridegroom
[2:19:19] you see we're walking in a simultaneous
[2:19:21] lap over
[2:19:22] because there are many of us who are
[2:19:23] beginning to taste the fruits of another
[2:19:25] age
[2:19:27] isn't that amazing that god would let us
[2:19:30] begin to taste now the promises of a new
[2:19:32] age a new hour
[2:19:37] we could say that there's part of the
[2:19:38] millennium dawning in our hearts even in
[2:19:40] this hour as we were raised up to sit
[2:19:42] together with christ in heavenly places
[2:19:44] i know i'm quit i know i'm moving
[2:19:45] quickly
[2:19:46] and but i want you to know it i wanted
[2:19:49] to get in you this this demon faith this
[2:19:51] demon belief is not enough it's got to
[2:19:53] come by revelation
[2:19:55] in acts 16 30 31 let me just give you
[2:19:58] this although this is so elementary and
[2:19:59] you know it very well acts 16 30 31 i'm
[2:20:02] on page four i'm doing better
[2:20:07] and brought them out
[2:20:09] and said sirs what must i do to be saved
[2:20:15] they said
[2:20:17] and i want you to know they said hasn't
[2:20:19] changed
[2:20:20] this is still the message for salvation
[2:20:23] believe on the lord jesus christ and
[2:20:27] thou shalt be
[2:20:28] saved and
[2:20:31] thy
[2:20:32] house
[2:20:34] believe
[2:20:35] now that's not the demon belief
[2:20:39] that's a mental belief that's just
[2:20:40] mental faith
[2:20:42] believe in tremble
[2:20:43] they're even affected by what they
[2:20:44] believe
[2:20:45] but it's not by revelation that they
[2:20:47] believe it
[2:20:48] they accepted it because it was told
[2:20:50] them don't you accept it because it's
[2:20:52] told to you don't you be satisfied with
[2:20:54] somebody else's uh understanding of what
[2:20:57] salvation is you keep pursuing christ
[2:21:00] until you experience the birth from
[2:21:01] above for yourself
[2:21:04] and you know that you know that you know
[2:21:06] that you have been born from above
[2:21:08] anybody with me
[2:21:10] and let me tell you something there will
[2:21:11] be those who are not a part of the
[2:21:13] elected bride of christ who will be
[2:21:14] saved in the last days as as part of the
[2:21:17] church simply because they believed on
[2:21:19] the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be
[2:21:21] saved let me tell you something however
[2:21:23] there will not be anyone living in
[2:21:26] eternity with eternal life that has not
[2:21:28] believed on the lord jesus christ to be
[2:21:30] saved
[2:21:32] so just because someone has been good to
[2:21:34] you or kind to the bride
[2:21:36] does not give them biblically
[2:21:39] a salvation
[2:21:41] a new birth
[2:21:43] an experience with god it must be those
[2:21:46] who believe on the lord jesus christ
[2:21:49] those are the ones who shall be saved
[2:21:52] and also given a promise for their house
[2:21:55] i claim the promise
[2:21:56] you should claim the promise for your
[2:21:58] family anointed ones at the end time
[2:22:00] paragraph 53 are you with me
[2:22:02] what is faith
[2:22:07] faith is something that's revealed to
[2:22:09] you
[2:22:10] there it is
[2:22:14] this is an intellectual faith or mental
[2:22:15] faith that's something told you and you
[2:22:17] said i believe that
[2:22:21] when you were a little child in sunday
[2:22:22] school the sunday school teacher said
[2:22:24] jesus died on the cross to forgive your
[2:22:25] sins you said hmm
[2:22:27] i believe that
[2:22:29] i trust this woman
[2:22:31] i trust my teacher
[2:22:33] seems to have done her good i believe
[2:22:36] this
[2:22:37] that's not all it takes
[2:22:42] that's just a mental that's just an
[2:22:44] accepting of facts someone tells you
[2:22:45] something you say i i think that's right
[2:22:48] that's not the kind of faith it's going
[2:22:50] to take to overcome in the end time
[2:22:52] you're going to have to have more faith
[2:22:53] than that what what what is above the
[2:22:55] faith from above is going to have to
[2:22:56] come down and meet with your faith your
[2:22:58] mental faith every man is given the
[2:23:00] measure of faith another writer to every
[2:23:01] man is given a measure a measure and b
[2:23:03] measure you've all got a faith given to
[2:23:06] you when you come here
[2:23:07] but that's a that's that develops into a
[2:23:09] mental faith or a
[2:23:11] or an intellectual concept of faith it's
[2:23:13] when the when the revelation of faith
[2:23:16] comes to you that you have something to
[2:23:17] stand
[2:23:18] what is faith faith is something that's
[2:23:20] revealed to you that is not yet
[2:23:23] you haven't seen the evidence you
[2:23:25] haven't held the substance but something
[2:23:27] in you says it's mine
[2:23:29] [Music]
[2:23:30] but you believe it will be are you still
[2:23:32] with me
[2:23:33] faith is what why don't you read then
[2:23:35] i'm tired faith
[2:23:40] that's what faith is it's a revelation
[2:23:41] of the will of god so by revelation
[2:23:45] and the churches today don't even
[2:23:46] believe in spiritual revelation well
[2:23:48] aren't we in trouble then aren't we in
[2:23:50] trouble then how can we overcome
[2:23:52] how can we do the greater works of jesus
[2:23:54] christ how can we be mark 16 in action
[2:23:57] how can we be one with the word how can
[2:24:00] the bride and the bridegroom become one
[2:24:01] in total union
[2:24:04] because all of these things come not by
[2:24:07] more preaching
[2:24:08] amen
[2:24:10] they come by revelation
[2:24:13] so if you don't ever revisit the things
[2:24:15] you hear you may never receive the
[2:24:18] adequate revelation
[2:24:22] they believe in a dogmatic teaching of
[2:24:24] some system by revelation abel offered
[2:24:26] unto god a more excellent sacrifice than
[2:24:28] that of cain which god testified he was
[2:24:31] righteous amen
[2:24:34] oh i like this
[2:24:38] he goes on i hope you see that see where
[2:24:40] we're living see the hour i was talking
[2:24:43] to a gentleman not long ago a christian
[2:24:44] scholar a gentleman he said other places
[2:24:47] brother branham said he was a baptist
[2:24:48] scholar
[2:24:49] he said mr branham
[2:24:51] we refuse all revelations i think that
[2:24:53] there's message people that believe the
[2:24:55] same
[2:24:58] we re we just you know nobody can have a
[2:25:01] dream
[2:25:04] nobody can have a vision
[2:25:06] god don't talk to nobody today
[2:25:09] he only talked to brother branham
[2:25:12] lost his tongue in 65
[2:25:18] no encounter
[2:25:26] then you have to refuse jesus christ
[2:25:29] go back to 54 please
[2:25:32] paragraph 54. he said mr brandon we
[2:25:33] refuse all revelations
[2:25:35] all
[2:25:36] right i said then you have to refuse
[2:25:39] jesus christ
[2:25:41] for he is the revelation of god
[2:25:43] god revealed in human flesh
[2:25:45] so if you're part of a church that says
[2:25:47] that god doesn't reveal himself today
[2:25:49] you have to reject the very fact that
[2:25:50] jesus is who he says he is
[2:25:52] because you have to refuse if you do
[2:25:54] that you refuse jesus christ for he is
[2:25:56] the revelation of god god revealed in
[2:25:58] human flesh unless you see it
[2:26:02] somebody read that for me
[2:26:04] [Music]
[2:26:06] it don't matter if jesus is is one or if
[2:26:08] jesus is the third member of the trinity
[2:26:10] or or if jesus is well that don't matter
[2:26:13] and it doesn't matter who you who you
[2:26:14] think jesus is just call on his name and
[2:26:17] it doesn't really matter if you
[2:26:18] understand that when he said i if you've
[2:26:20] seen me you've seen the father that he
[2:26:21] meant what he said those things aren't
[2:26:23] really important they must be
[2:26:26] because a vindicated prophetic voice
[2:26:28] said unless you see it
[2:26:32] for he is the revelation of god god
[2:26:34] revealed in human flesh who is jesus god
[2:26:37] revealed in human flesh unless you see
[2:26:40] it you're lost well i want to see it
[2:26:42] because i don't know about you but i
[2:26:44] want to be found
[2:26:45] jesus said except you believe that i am
[2:26:47] he you will die in your sin he is the
[2:26:49] revelation of god the spirit of god
[2:26:51] revealed in human form if you believe
[2:26:53] that say amen
[2:26:55] i believe it with everything that's
[2:26:56] within me
[2:26:58] amen he said you can't believe that
[2:27:01] you're lost
[2:27:02] you put him a third person second person
[2:27:04] or any other person besides god you're
[2:27:06] lost
[2:27:07] except you believe that i am he you will
[2:27:09] die in your sins that's jesus he's
[2:27:11] quoting jesus
[2:27:13] a revelation
[2:27:15] it takes a revelation
[2:27:23] revelation can hold you
[2:27:27] when god's not talking
[2:27:31] he talks
[2:27:33] he's a walking talking god
[2:27:35] he talks
[2:27:36] he gives dreams he gives visions
[2:27:40] let me just help you a little bit with
[2:27:41] what joan of arc discovered
[2:27:44] sometimes god's doing a lot of talking
[2:27:47] and sometimes he ain't
[2:27:51] and you've got to live the same
[2:27:52] sustained
[2:27:54] con
[2:27:56] consistent life
[2:27:58] when he's not talking
[2:28:00] that you're living when he is talking
[2:28:03] are you following me
[2:28:04] it's vitally important that we are
[2:28:08] living the same life when he's not
[2:28:10] talking he talks
[2:28:13] but there's times that he's silent
[2:28:15] and when he's silent that's the moment
[2:28:17] that only faith by revelation can hold
[2:28:20] us to him
[2:28:21] i want to tell you a story that i love
[2:28:23] to tell
[2:28:25] i'm going to read you a story that i
[2:28:26] love to read it'll take me just a moment
[2:28:28] to do it and then maybe we will just
[2:28:29] stop
[2:28:30] it's in a message called an absolute
[2:28:32] phoenix arizona paragraph 228.
[2:28:36] he said in the times of my trouble back
[2:28:38] there when i lost my family most of you
[2:28:41] know there may be some listening that do
[2:28:42] not brother branham lost both his wife
[2:28:45] and his little daughter sharon rose
[2:28:48] in the in the uh pneumonia and all the
[2:28:50] disease that followed the great flood
[2:28:53] that caused the ohio river to rise there
[2:28:56] in jeffersonville and and caused the
[2:28:59] loss of so many lives brother branham
[2:29:01] lost the love of his life his wife hope
[2:29:04] and also his little baby girl sharon
[2:29:07] rose he's referring back to that when i
[2:29:09] lost my family and my life almost was
[2:29:12] taken from me
[2:29:13] some of you might remember that after
[2:29:15] that brother branham tried to take his
[2:29:16] own life
[2:29:18] and was unsuccessful in doing so
[2:29:20] my little girl died and me praying for
[2:29:22] her and after i had been on the streets
[2:29:24] day and night preaching and praying
[2:29:27] and trying to do what was right
[2:29:29] you've heard my life story
[2:29:32] many of you read it
[2:29:34] and my had come to a place i see my wife
[2:29:37] die
[2:29:38] and me holding her hand
[2:29:40] my little baby took sick a few hours
[2:29:42] after that and i got down there and
[2:29:44] prayed and uh with all was in me looked
[2:29:48] like a black sheep let down and refuse
[2:29:50] to answer my prayer anybody listening
[2:29:53] and then satan comes to me and said
[2:29:56] this is the point i want to make as i
[2:29:58] prepare to read this
[2:30:00] it seems like in those moments when
[2:30:02] god's not talking guess who he is
[2:30:06] the enemy will always take advantage of
[2:30:09] those moments when you can hear from god
[2:30:13] and he will fill your ears and your mind
[2:30:16] with all of his lies just like he did
[2:30:18] here to brother branham
[2:30:20] he said you see
[2:30:22] you're only about 20 years old
[2:30:24] and hear you
[2:30:26] what all you've done and you've
[2:30:27] neglected yourself and you've done all
[2:30:29] these things you forfeit all your young
[2:30:31] life
[2:30:32] about
[2:30:33] when you should have been out having a
[2:30:35] big time like the rest of the young
[2:30:36] folks
[2:30:38] and here you stood on the street corner
[2:30:40] crying and praying you went all night of
[2:30:42] time in the hospital hour after hour and
[2:30:44] when it come to your own blood and flesh
[2:30:46] he refuses to hear you
[2:30:51] isn't that just like satan
[2:30:54] you prayed and prayed and prayed and god
[2:30:55] heard your prayer neal many but when you
[2:30:57] really needed god
[2:30:59] when you were facing death
[2:31:01] the death of your own family where was
[2:31:03] your god then
[2:31:04] brother brandon said that was one time i
[2:31:06] was tempted
[2:31:08] let's go on
[2:31:10] but i happen to remember back
[2:31:13] i got an absolute
[2:31:17] like job though he slay me
[2:31:20] yet i'll trust him
[2:31:22] i don't care what comes or goes now
[2:31:24] folks when you read a story like this it
[2:31:26] ought to help you not to complain so
[2:31:28] much
[2:31:31] about your little circumstances and
[2:31:32] situations in life this is a big one
[2:31:35] this is a biggie isn't it
[2:31:37] he said i don't care what comes or goes
[2:31:38] let's go on
[2:31:40] the state senator of indiana sam eisler
[2:31:43] he come too he come
[2:31:44] come he's come to the tabernacle he's
[2:31:47] deceased now about two years fine man he
[2:31:50] was coming down the road
[2:31:52] and i was going up to pray up at the
[2:31:54] grave where wife and baby were laying
[2:31:57] it was right after the 37 flood and i
[2:31:59] had on a pair of boots
[2:32:01] and i was walking up the road crying
[2:32:05] little billy my son was just about to
[2:32:07] die too the doctors had done said
[2:32:09] there's not hardly anything more to do
[2:32:10] for him he had some kind of dysentery
[2:32:13] they couldn't stop an infection
[2:32:16] and i was crying praying and i thought
[2:32:18] well i was still holding on to god i was
[2:32:21] going up the road crying
[2:32:22] [Music]
[2:32:23] i thought i'd go up and listen i used to
[2:32:25] sit up there of an evening by the grave
[2:32:28] i'd hear an old dove come down there and
[2:32:31] go to singing i'd hear the pines blow
[2:32:34] and the winds through the through the
[2:32:35] pines rather
[2:32:38] and it sound like they would say
[2:32:44] there's a land
[2:32:47] beyond the river
[2:32:50] they call
[2:32:51] the sweet forever
[2:32:55] and we only reach that shore by faith's
[2:32:58] decree
[2:33:01] one by one we gain the portal
[2:33:05] there to dwell
[2:33:06] with the immortal
[2:33:09] when they ring those golden bells
[2:33:14] for you and me
[2:33:17] do you hear what he was saying
[2:33:19] in my lowest moment when i couldn't hear
[2:33:23] and satan was in my ear talking all the
[2:33:26] time
[2:33:27] and i'm walking down the road crying
[2:33:30] it seemed like i could hear the wind and
[2:33:32] the pines singing
[2:33:35] when they ring those golden bells for
[2:33:37] you and me i've been there
[2:33:40] i've sat in the old rocking chair ready
[2:33:43] to see my life over with even as a young
[2:33:45] man so broken
[2:33:47] and so much in trouble
[2:33:49] and i could hear the rocking chair
[2:33:51] rocking out the words
[2:33:53] some through the water some through the
[2:33:55] flood
[2:33:56] some through the fire but all through
[2:33:58] the blood god leads his dear children
[2:34:00] along god uses music like that sometimes
[2:34:02] to speak to us all right let's read on a
[2:34:05] minute he said i'd stand there cry and
[2:34:08] look up and i'd say to my wife and baby
[2:34:10] i know you're not laying here
[2:34:14] this is just where i planted the remains
[2:34:17] that i held in my arms but somewhere
[2:34:20] beyond the river you're there
[2:34:25] so i was going up to that place one day
[2:34:27] to set up at the grave and had on a pair
[2:34:29] of boots walking along an old car came
[2:34:31] up beside me stopped it was mr isler the
[2:34:34] state centered and he jumped out of the
[2:34:35] car and pulled around and come back put
[2:34:37] his arms around me and said billy
[2:34:40] i sure feel sorry
[2:34:43] i said that's all right brother isler
[2:34:47] and he said i ought to have stopped
[2:34:50] he seen i was weeping and i said that's
[2:34:52] all right mr isa and he said i'm going
[2:34:54] to ask you something son i said all
[2:34:57] right go ahead and ask me
[2:34:59] he said i've seen you stand there in
[2:35:01] that pulpit till i thought you'd die
[2:35:04] said i've seen you fast till you'd be so
[2:35:06] peak and i felt sorry for you and said
[2:35:09] in and out and in and out day and night
[2:35:11] he said and then your wife and baby in
[2:35:14] there see you look at them things
[2:35:17] and he said what does christ mean to you
[2:35:20] now
[2:35:23] and i said thou
[2:35:25] the stream of all my comfort
[2:35:28] more
[2:35:29] than life to me
[2:35:31] whom have i
[2:35:33] on earth beside thee or whom in heaven
[2:35:37] but thee
[2:35:39] i didn't answer
[2:35:41] see i had found that absolute
[2:35:45] you don't find the absolute church
[2:35:47] without revelation
[2:35:50] you don't get it by just getting more
[2:35:52] information
[2:35:54] you don't get it just by hearing another
[2:35:56] sermon
[2:35:58] you only find the absolute when the holy
[2:36:01] ghost reveals to you who he is
[2:36:06] amen see i'd found that absolute that
[2:36:10] something that held me
[2:36:12] when the storm was on
[2:36:16] let's go on
[2:36:18] someone said to me
[2:36:20] billy did you keep your religion
[2:36:23] during the time of your trouble
[2:36:27] you you know i know they probably meant
[2:36:29] well
[2:36:30] it almost sounds mocking doesn't it
[2:36:33] oh billy
[2:36:35] did you keep your religion when you were
[2:36:37] going through all that trouble
[2:36:39] he said no
[2:36:41] [Laughter]
[2:36:44] no
[2:36:45] it kept me
[2:36:48] why because it wasn't just religion
[2:36:52] he didn't have just a mental concept of
[2:36:54] faith or an intellectual concept of
[2:36:57] faith faith had been made live it had
[2:37:00] been made real to him by the power of
[2:37:03] the holy spirit
[2:37:04] god had given him a
[2:37:06] revelation
[2:37:09] of what could hold him in times like
[2:37:10] this he said no
[2:37:12] no no no
[2:37:14] it
[2:37:15] kept
[2:37:16] me
[2:37:19] see that's what i said that's what it
[2:37:21] was
[2:37:22] i was tied to him
[2:37:25] in the hours when my strength was gone
[2:37:28] and there's nothing i could do my anchor
[2:37:31] held
[2:37:33] my god help us
[2:37:36] my anchor held within the veil of his
[2:37:39] word
[2:37:40] see it's a revelation
[2:37:42] see it's a revelation
[2:37:44] god reveals it he makes it really
[2:37:46] quickens it to you my anchor held within
[2:37:48] the veil of the word out yonder where
[2:37:52] sometimes i don't understand it listen
[2:37:55] sometimes i don't understand it
[2:37:58] sometimes i think what makes me do the
[2:38:00] things i do there is something with
[2:38:03] inside me
[2:38:06] listen
[2:38:10] you ever had it
[2:38:11] you ever felt that life of christ you
[2:38:14] mean brother are you yes really yes i'm
[2:38:17] asking you have you ever really felt
[2:38:19] that life of christ on the inside of you
[2:38:23] pulsating inside of you some of you
[2:38:27] buried your loved ones some here buried
[2:38:30] their husbands some buried so many that
[2:38:33] they loved and cared for some faced with
[2:38:35] such awful circumstances of life and in
[2:38:38] that hour how did you get through how
[2:38:40] did you hold on to your religion you
[2:38:42] didn't
[2:38:44] you didn't hold on to nothing
[2:38:47] jesus was holding on to you
[2:38:49] i know you know that
[2:38:52] it was that life brother branham said i
[2:38:53] don't understand why i do the things i
[2:38:55] do
[2:38:56] there's something with inside me
[2:38:58] pulsating me
[2:39:02] it's the life of christ
[2:39:06] moving in us
[2:39:09] quickening us
[2:39:11] he said i can't keep from doing it
[2:39:13] brother
[2:39:15] i have to yield to that life
[2:39:18] that is within me
[2:39:20] is anybody here
[2:39:22] i
[2:39:25] i i oh my
[2:39:27] i'm going to close
[2:39:35] i want to share one other thing
[2:39:38] this is one of my favorite things to
[2:39:40] share
[2:39:44] i brought
[2:39:47] some of this to you in
[2:39:50] 2003 i looked up to see and i brought
[2:39:53] some of this to you in
[2:39:55] 2013.
[2:39:57] either way i think it's long enough we
[2:39:59] could have a little rerun this morning
[2:40:02] pull two thoughts together from from
[2:40:04] some notes but god inspired me i felt
[2:40:07] like he inspired me to do it and i don't
[2:40:08] want to ruin it
[2:40:10] this is what i like to close with but
[2:40:12] i'm going to i'm going to close today
[2:40:14] with it and not not the message i'll
[2:40:16] bring some more of this later
[2:40:18] it's one of my favorite stories to tell
[2:40:20] i'm going to read it because i want to
[2:40:21] get every detail
[2:40:23] and i want you to understand that
[2:40:25] sometimes we look at our faith and
[2:40:27] we look at it and see it entirely
[2:40:28] different than god sees it
[2:40:31] i know that sometimes things happen in
[2:40:33] our life and
[2:40:34] we don't understand them and
[2:40:38] we could say today without trying to
[2:40:40] bring any extra pain but we could say
[2:40:42] sister anita sitting there we don't
[2:40:44] understand
[2:40:46] how
[2:40:47] how
[2:40:48] we hoped and prayed and believed and how
[2:40:50] we wished it could be different
[2:40:53] nothing would make me any happier in
[2:40:55] this world than to have brother steve
[2:40:57] over there helping me preach
[2:40:59] like i've preached today
[2:41:00] him over there on that or i could have
[2:41:02] really preached with him on that organ
[2:41:04] today i could have really preached if
[2:41:06] he'd been
[2:41:07] backing me up on that organ just a young
[2:41:09] man
[2:41:10] right at my age
[2:41:12] believe me
[2:41:13] that's
[2:41:14] young
[2:41:16] already in the presence of the lord
[2:41:19] and the enemy says if you'd have just
[2:41:21] had more faith
[2:41:23] you would just use a little more oil
[2:41:26] you'd just pray a little longer
[2:41:28] if you're just fasted another meal
[2:41:32] that's not how it works
[2:41:35] that's what the enemy uses to beat us up
[2:41:37] and run us crazy
[2:41:39] god has a plan
[2:41:41] you're not going to change god's plan
[2:41:44] you're going to learn to adapt to god's
[2:41:46] plan
[2:41:47] that's what believers do
[2:41:49] i want to read you this little story of
[2:41:51] little deborah
[2:41:52] statscliff
[2:41:55] i just noticed
[2:41:57] sister weems
[2:41:58] not here today but
[2:42:01] sister weems knew
[2:42:03] the statscliff family
[2:42:06] and
[2:42:07] some years after she came here she gave
[2:42:09] me some
[2:42:11] books that belong to brother julius
[2:42:13] statscliff
[2:42:15] i treasure them
[2:42:17] to have something that belonged to him
[2:42:19] man of faith
[2:42:21] and he wrote the book that has gone
[2:42:23] around the world a prophet visit south
[2:42:25] africa
[2:42:26] and this is his story
[2:42:30] the little baby deborah brother branham
[2:42:31] says in paragraph six of the message of
[2:42:33] the messiah
[2:42:35] i just let a little woman coming in from
[2:42:37] germany
[2:42:38] just left a little woman coming in from
[2:42:40] germany
[2:42:42] a few weeks ago she lost a baby
[2:42:46] she was standing near in california once
[2:42:51] when they brought in a little baby had
[2:42:53] been dead died one morning about three
[2:42:55] or four o'clock
[2:42:59] parents had drove all day and it was
[2:43:01] about three or four or five o'clock six
[2:43:03] o'clock in the afternoon
[2:43:05] 12 hours or more had passed
[2:43:08] with a little dead baby in their arms
[2:43:11] let's go back
[2:43:15] the mother sitting in the back of the
[2:43:17] car
[2:43:18] holding this little cold form in her
[2:43:20] arms all right
[2:43:24] and when they come to the place where i
[2:43:25] was at san bernardino
[2:43:28] they took the little baby and brought it
[2:43:29] to where i was standing and i said oh
[2:43:32] how long has the baby been dead she said
[2:43:34] since this morning early
[2:43:36] and i picked up the little cold form it
[2:43:38] was already stiffened
[2:43:40] and these people standing around sister
[2:43:43] statscliff was one of the ones that was
[2:43:45] there in that meeting in san bernardino
[2:43:47] she saw this
[2:43:49] these people standing around i held it
[2:43:51] in my arms and started praying to our
[2:43:54] precious lord
[2:43:56] i felt the baby getting warm think of it
[2:44:00] just kept holding it just a few minutes
[2:44:02] and it started kicking and crying
[2:44:04] and i hand it over to his mother i
[2:44:06] believe it
[2:44:08] you don't have to
[2:44:09] but i believe it enough for both of us
[2:44:12] because i've encountered that god who
[2:44:14] can do us exceedingly and abundantly
[2:44:16] above
[2:44:17] i've encountered the god of the
[2:44:19] impossible he takes the impossible and
[2:44:21] makes it possible i have no no hardship
[2:44:24] no problem whatsoever believing that god
[2:44:26] raised this little babies this little
[2:44:28] dead baby to a life in brother brown's
[2:44:30] arm and i hand it over to his mother so
[2:44:32] then when
[2:44:36] all right go go to paragraph eight
[2:44:39] so then with this little mother standing
[2:44:41] here she
[2:44:42] her baby died over in germany so i want
[2:44:44] you to understand because we did leave
[2:44:46] out a paragraph there
[2:44:49] sister statscliff saw this miracle she
[2:44:51] knew about this miracle so over in
[2:44:53] germany where he was serving in the
[2:44:55] armed forces
[2:45:03] when she heard when she when her little
[2:45:05] baby got sick
[2:45:07] she remembered what she saw
[2:45:10] and she wanted the same miracle
[2:45:13] for her little child
[2:45:15] my mind got distracted because i saw
[2:45:18] i saw the sign just as clear as day i
[2:45:21] don't know why
[2:45:22] i saw it because i've been just outside
[2:45:24] the gate i've seen the sign in the
[2:45:25] natural natural lamb stool
[2:45:29] that's where that's where the plane was
[2:45:31] uh on the runway ready to come and get
[2:45:34] brother branham
[2:45:36] and i don't know why in the world but
[2:45:37] just clears just just before me i saw
[2:45:39] the the sign uh
[2:45:43] welcoming people there to the the great
[2:45:46] uh base it remains today one of our
[2:45:49] places in germany
[2:45:51] if you know anything about
[2:45:53] those injured in in the wars they're
[2:45:56] brought
[2:45:57] many of our service men
[2:45:59] were brought to landstuhl through the
[2:46:00] years to be cared for and nursed back to
[2:46:03] life
[2:46:04] and he was serving as a chaplain over
[2:46:07] this whole area but anyway i i don't
[2:46:09] know why they came her baby died over in
[2:46:11] germany her husband's a chaplain and
[2:46:13] they called up long distance about five
[2:46:15] times through a day and night to ask me
[2:46:18] to come said they know that god would
[2:46:20] raise that little baby up how did she
[2:46:22] know
[2:46:24] because she'd seen god do it
[2:46:27] and it became a revelation to her that
[2:46:30] god is still able the same yesterday and
[2:46:32] today and forever
[2:46:34] you couldn't talk her out of it
[2:46:37] little mother's standing there all right
[2:46:38] let's go on
[2:46:40] i said let me go pray and i went and
[2:46:42] prayed and prayed that afternoon and
[2:46:44] that night
[2:46:45] and i'll show you whether the doctors
[2:46:46] believe or not when she'd already give
[2:46:49] the doctor my book to read
[2:46:52] i believe called prophet visits africa
[2:46:55] it was a prophet visit south africa it
[2:46:58] was the book that her husband had
[2:46:59] already written something like that
[2:47:01] so the doctor the little baby had
[2:47:03] already read this book had already seen
[2:47:05] the miracles that book if you've never
[2:47:07] read it you should i gave every family a
[2:47:09] copy of it uh oh sometime back now and i
[2:47:13] have a few copies i'll be glad to give
[2:47:14] you
[2:47:15] the miracles in that if you've never if
[2:47:17] you don't have one in your home you can
[2:47:19] certainly have one the miracles in that
[2:47:21] book what god did in those meetings in
[2:47:24] south africa oh my
[2:47:27] i
[2:47:29] i have a book in fact i have a book back
[2:47:31] there signed by the mayor of of
[2:47:33] johannesburg who was baptized in the
[2:47:35] name of the lord jesus christ my brother
[2:47:37] sidney jackson
[2:47:38] and brother stan esterhausen am i
[2:47:40] throwing too many names out brother stan
[2:47:43] esterhouse and introduced me to him and
[2:47:45] uh and gay and he sent me this book with
[2:47:48] a picture of himself being baptized in
[2:47:50] the name of the lord jesus christ just a
[2:47:52] secular man but he became so moved by
[2:47:54] what he saw god do in those meetings
[2:47:58] and uh so anyway forgive me he said let
[2:48:00] me go pray i went and prayed
[2:48:03] all right let's go on
[2:48:04] and when she said god will raise the
[2:48:06] baby up the little mother said god will
[2:48:09] raise the baby up and the baby had been
[2:48:11] dead before they knowed it about four or
[2:48:13] five hours and so they got the father
[2:48:15] word down to the base where he was
[2:48:18] and the baby had been dead died in the
[2:48:20] night
[2:48:21] and so the doctor said all right tell
[2:48:23] you what i'll do i'll slip over and turn
[2:48:25] the oxygen back on
[2:48:27] now listen at a doctor like that and he
[2:48:30] let the baby lay there for two days
[2:48:34] with the oxygen turned on waiting
[2:48:38] and i was over here praying they were
[2:48:40] going to fly me across with a jet i
[2:48:43] could leave here with an army jet and be
[2:48:44] back the same day to germany
[2:48:46] now when he tells a lot of the details i
[2:48:48] don't know if it's here for another
[2:48:50] place he said the jet was actually on
[2:48:51] the runway in germany ready to take off
[2:48:54] to come and pick him up it had already
[2:48:56] been commissioned and sent and
[2:48:58] permission had already been granted
[2:49:00] and one morning about daylight i got up
[2:49:02] and the wife went out of the room in
[2:49:04] fact in another place he tells it he
[2:49:06] said she kept knocking on the door bill
[2:49:09] we've got to tell those people something
[2:49:10] we got to tell them something we got to
[2:49:12] tell them something but he didn't have
[2:49:13] anything to tell him he just said you i
[2:49:15] can't tell him i don't have anything to
[2:49:17] tell him he was just putting them off
[2:49:19] because he hadn't heard from the lord
[2:49:21] and one morning about daylight i got up
[2:49:23] and the wife went out of the room
[2:49:25] it just waked up
[2:49:27] i just waked up laying there a little
[2:49:28] bit directly i heard something coming
[2:49:30] into the room and i looked
[2:49:33] there was something moving in the room
[2:49:34] and i jumped up and i said lord what
[2:49:37] would you have your servant know
[2:49:39] and he said
[2:49:41] do not rebuke that
[2:49:44] that's the hand of the lord
[2:49:48] see
[2:49:51] brother branham was looking for an
[2:49:52] answer of whether he should go to
[2:49:55] germany and pray and see that little
[2:49:56] baby raised from the dead he had no
[2:49:58] doubt that god was able to do it he'd
[2:49:59] seen god do it sister stats brother
[2:50:02] julius they had no doubt that god was
[2:50:04] able to raise that baby but hear the
[2:50:05] word of the lord come don't rebuke that
[2:50:08] that's the hand of the lord how could it
[2:50:10] be how could it be the hand of the lord
[2:50:12] for that little baby that high coach god
[2:50:13] has a purpose and a plan that we don't
[2:50:15] always know don't know about
[2:50:17] huh
[2:50:18] he has a purpose he has a plan i can't
[2:50:20] see how that could be look folks
[2:50:22] sometimes it's not for us to see
[2:50:24] it's for us to trust i tell you what god
[2:50:26] will do he'll harness trouble won't he
[2:50:28] he'll put a harness on trials and on
[2:50:30] troubles and tribulations and he'll
[2:50:32] bring us to our knees
[2:50:45] he said do not rebuke that
[2:50:48] that's the hand of the lord see
[2:50:51] so i got her on the phone and i said no
[2:50:53] can you imagine the call
[2:50:59] so i said no god has called your baby
[2:51:07] and so when she come over to see us that
[2:51:10] night the night and and he's talking
[2:51:12] about a period of time has passed
[2:51:15] the stats now come to the states and one
[2:51:18] of the first places they want to go is
[2:51:20] the jeffersonville where brother branham
[2:51:21] is and they have an arrangement made to
[2:51:24] meet him in the in the den
[2:51:27] and she's there waiting for an answer
[2:51:31] her at the house when i left yesterday
[2:51:33] she said what was it brother branham
[2:51:36] my weakness of faith
[2:51:39] see how the enemy had been talking to
[2:51:41] that mama
[2:51:43] if you'd just had more faith
[2:51:46] that baby would oh i tell you i despise
[2:51:50] the lies of that filthy devil
[2:51:55] aren't they already grieving their cells
[2:51:57] into a dither haven't they suffered
[2:52:00] enough loss
[2:52:02] for that dirty lord down souffle to come
[2:52:05] along and say if you'd have just had
[2:52:08] more
[2:52:09] faith
[2:52:10] [Music]
[2:52:12] in that just like the devil
[2:52:15] who could listen to his filthy dirty
[2:52:18] lies
[2:52:19] he only picks on us when we're broken
[2:52:22] when we're weak
[2:52:24] when we can't hardly stand up
[2:52:27] takes advantage of our sorrow and our
[2:52:29] pain
[2:52:31] he said brother random was it my
[2:52:33] weakness of faith
[2:52:35] i said
[2:52:36] you
[2:52:37] have
[2:52:38] great
[2:52:40] faith
[2:52:44] days weeks had gone by in fact a couple
[2:52:46] of months had gone by and every day she
[2:52:48] was tormented by the reality this this
[2:52:51] slow
[2:52:52] sinking feeling if you would have just
[2:52:54] had faith but the man who said you
[2:52:57] prayed for your baby you and your
[2:52:58] husband held on to it god to raise that
[2:53:01] baby and he refused to do it because he
[2:53:06] knows what's best
[2:53:12] how did brother branham know that she
[2:53:14] had great faith
[2:53:16] well he could have discerned it
[2:53:18] he could have seen it in the spirit
[2:53:20] he had that kind of gift operating in
[2:53:22] his life but here was the evidence
[2:53:26] he knows what's best and still you love
[2:53:30] him
[2:53:33] you know how i know anita curry's faith
[2:53:35] is real you know how i know april
[2:53:37] mcfarland's faith is real
[2:53:41] you know how i'm able to look around
[2:53:43] this room and see a room full of people
[2:53:44] that i know their faith is real
[2:53:46] because they have faced those moments
[2:53:51] it's not just death
[2:53:53] it's all kinds of tragedies and all
[2:53:55] kinds of heartaches and all kinds of
[2:53:57] betrayals and all kinds of
[2:53:59] disappointments and all kinds of hope
[2:54:02] deferred
[2:54:05] all kinds of misunderstandings
[2:54:09] that could have caused every one of us
[2:54:11] to throw in the towel throw up our hands
[2:54:13] and say i don't want nothing to do with
[2:54:15] god i don't want nothing to do with
[2:54:16] church i don't want to have nothing to
[2:54:18] do with church people but you're here
[2:54:22] and even without a whole band brother
[2:54:24] shane we were lifted our hands to
[2:54:26] worship god and to give god praise and
[2:54:30] with so many of our people missing we
[2:54:32] weren't
[2:54:34] i kept saying to everybody who said to
[2:54:36] me this is what a pastor has to do to
[2:54:38] keep himself encouraged
[2:54:40] people said well we'll hardly have
[2:54:41] nobody there sunday won't hardly have
[2:54:43] nobody there i'll be there i say it
[2:54:46] we'll be there most of all god will be
[2:54:49] there
[2:54:50] and he's the one that counts i just kept
[2:54:52] saying that over and over again and you
[2:54:54] you surprised me this morning
[2:54:56] so many here
[2:54:59] we're here
[2:55:00] not because we've never had a trial
[2:55:04] i've given you my testimony i've seen my
[2:55:06] mother beaten to the floor
[2:55:09] the blood running down her face
[2:55:11] i saw my own natural dad pick up my
[2:55:14] little
[2:55:15] grandmother in such anger and pick her
[2:55:18] up and throw her down the hall like a
[2:55:19] bowling ball
[2:55:21] and she went flying down the hall could
[2:55:23] have broke a hip could have broke a back
[2:55:25] i saw them walk out and crush the
[2:55:28] windshield with a concrete block just
[2:55:32] rage and so much anger so much hurt and
[2:55:35] so just so much disappointment
[2:55:38] just
[2:55:39] before i was five right at five
[2:55:42] i remember the day my dad left
[2:55:45] i can see it just like
[2:55:47] i closed my eyes i don't even have to
[2:55:49] close my eyes to see it anymore
[2:55:51] i'm holding on to his leg
[2:55:54] i've got both of my arms wrapped around
[2:55:56] his leg and i'm standing on his shoe
[2:55:59] and he's dragging me
[2:56:04] all the way to the car with his suitcase
[2:56:07] to leave our family
[2:56:09] for a woman that he's already chosen
[2:56:13] i can
[2:56:14] it doesn't take much to bring the memory
[2:56:16] up finally he saw that i wasn't going to
[2:56:18] turn loose and i wasn't
[2:56:20] i was not going to turn loose and he
[2:56:21] just did i don't mean i don't mean to
[2:56:23] make you think he ill of him he was he
[2:56:26] was arrested by an enemy he was
[2:56:28] possessed by a devil
[2:56:30] he was doing things out of his own head
[2:56:33] he didn't even know the consequences of
[2:56:35] the sin that he was involved in
[2:56:37] but just
[2:56:38] for my own safety perhaps
[2:56:41] and his own sanity when he when he
[2:56:43] squatted down to start to get in the car
[2:56:45] he took took his hand and with a little
[2:56:48] bit of pressure
[2:56:50] pushed me pulled me off of his leg and
[2:56:52] and
[2:56:53] and push me away
[2:56:55] like you would a dog trying to climb
[2:56:57] your leg
[2:56:58] i know what hurt means
[2:57:01] i know what disappointment is i'm just
[2:57:03] i'm just here so i get to tell mine you
[2:57:06] don't have the opportunity to tell yours
[2:57:08] but we could go around this room and
[2:57:09] this is a room full of hurting people
[2:57:12] this is a room full of people that have
[2:57:13] seen a lot of heartache and a lot of
[2:57:15] disappointment and we made a lot of bad
[2:57:17] decisions and we paid a lot of hard
[2:57:19] prices
[2:57:22] this room is it can easily hold us but
[2:57:26] this room couldn't hold the
[2:57:28] disappointment and the heartache and the
[2:57:30] pain and the sorrow and the loss that
[2:57:33] that could fill up this room just from
[2:57:35] the people in this room not to mention
[2:57:37] those who are streaming this service and
[2:57:38] yet we're here
[2:57:43] and our feelings are not on our sleeves
[2:57:46] and we're not bitter to our god
[2:57:50] we've decided that he's worth serving
[2:57:54] we've decided that he is life
[2:57:58] to us
[2:57:59] that there is no hope and no peace and
[2:58:02] no joy and no reality in anything but
[2:58:05] knowing jesus and serving him with every
[2:58:08] father of our being no church our
[2:58:10] religion didn't hold us
[2:58:14] we didn't keep our religion it was god
[2:58:17] who held on to us
[2:58:19] in those very difficult times
[2:58:22] and it wasn't a lack of sister
[2:58:24] statscliff's faith
[2:58:26] that caused her to lose her little baby
[2:58:28] in fact it was god's trust in her he saw
[2:58:33] he refused to do it because he knew he
[2:58:35] had a better plan
[2:58:37] and he knew that she would still love
[2:58:39] him
[2:58:40] and still serving she may have questions
[2:58:43] she might have to get to america to talk
[2:58:44] to the prophet but she would not waver
[2:58:47] he shall handle boho
[2:58:50] he come to my
[2:58:51] eye
[2:58:52] musicians are coming
[2:58:54] she would not waver
[2:59:08] she would hold on
[2:59:12] let's read it on that's real faith
[2:59:16] he said anybody when mountains are
[2:59:17] moving and things can have faith but let
[2:59:20] it go backwards one time
[2:59:21] and see how it works
[2:59:23] that's when you prove
[2:59:25] whether you've got faith or not
[2:59:27] you let things be tested you let things
[2:59:29] be shifted you let things get out of
[2:59:31] order
[2:59:32] oh you let some disappointments come so
[2:59:34] misunderstand him that's when you'll
[2:59:36] know whether you've got real faith or
[2:59:37] not not just a mental concept
[2:59:42] a revelation of faith anybody with me
[2:59:44] i know you're weary so am i now
[2:59:46] he said every son that cometh to god
[2:59:48] must be chastened and tried of god
[2:59:51] so remember
[2:59:54] our trials work patience
[2:59:57] and patience worse hope
[3:00:00] and so forth
[3:00:02] would you read that for me
[3:00:06] so what do we do
[3:00:07] what do we do
[3:00:09] we just hold on
[3:00:11] to god
[3:00:14] how can we do that
[3:00:16] because he's holding on to us
[3:00:19] whether he blesses us or not
[3:00:23] whether we see the answer to every
[3:00:24] prayer or not
[3:00:27] we are right there to believe him anyhow
[3:00:29] because he's promised it
[3:00:31] and to see how he does
[3:00:33] how many of you trust him
[3:00:36] i trust him would you stand with me
[3:00:40] oh ben let's sing uh
[3:00:42] let's sing what we were singing
[3:00:44] before in the service the old hymn

[3:07:12] i want us to pray right now and i want
[3:07:15] us everyone who
[3:07:16] see the need of having a revelation
[3:07:20] of faith
[3:07:21] you know i believe that it can come in
[3:07:24] layers i do i believe it can come in
[3:07:26] in layers and in levels
[3:07:29] i would like to have a greater
[3:07:31] revelation of faith
[3:07:32] i would like that all that heaven has to
[3:07:35] come down on the faith that i have been
[3:07:37] able to put together
[3:07:39] i would like to be carried into new
[3:07:41] levels and dimensions and depths of
[3:07:43] faith to believe god for the greater
[3:07:46] for the things that look impossible to
[3:07:48] man
[3:07:50] i'd like to see the greater fulfillment
[3:07:52] of mark 16 wouldn't you
[3:07:54] i'd like to see the greater works that
[3:07:56] jesus promised so why don't we pray
[3:07:59] together right now
[3:08:01] individually for ourselves that god
[3:08:04] would come that he would give us
[3:08:07] the revelation that we need to stand in
[3:08:09] this hour that he would pour out the
[3:08:11] holy ghost
[3:08:12] on the truth that goes forth that that
[3:08:15] we dig through that we search through
[3:08:17] that we listen to
[3:08:19] that the holy ghost would come and
[3:08:21] quicken it and make it alive until it
[3:08:23] become a part of who we are a revelation
[3:08:26] that can never pass let's pray together
[3:08:28] right now that god would grant that to
[3:08:30] each of us father
[3:08:32] here we stand today in your presence
[3:08:35] lord
[3:08:36] you've been with us today and you're
[3:08:38] talking to our hearts
[3:08:41] and lord we we need it we recognize that
[3:08:44] there there are there must be greater
[3:08:47] faith there there must be higher
[3:08:49] dimensions and revelations of faith
[3:08:52] that that is available because there's a
[3:08:55] deep crying out
[3:08:57] in us
[3:08:58] to have
[3:08:59] that revelation of faith that refuses to
[3:09:02] move based on circumstances
[3:09:05] lord the supersense of faith
[3:09:08] that the prophet talked about
[3:09:11] lord that's the kind of faith we want to
[3:09:12] operate in in the last days
[3:09:15] and that that servant of the lord he
[3:09:17] made the connection between perfect
[3:09:19] faith and perfect love
[3:09:21] and so lord we're after that
[3:09:23] we desire that with you today so we
[3:09:26] reach up right now every one of us is
[3:09:28] individual believers and we say lord
[3:09:31] would you pour the holy ghost out on the
[3:09:34] faith that we have
[3:09:35] would you anoint it would you give us
[3:09:38] revelation so that it becomes a deeper
[3:09:40] part of who we are
[3:09:42] and lord we not only look to faith today
[3:09:45] but we look to every one of those
[3:09:46] virtues that are promised in the stature
[3:09:49] of maturity and the stature of the
[3:09:51] perfect man we look to every one of
[3:09:53] those virtues today and we pray that
[3:09:55] what heaven has would come and join
[3:09:58] together with what we are able to to
[3:10:01] operate in in this hour and that it
[3:10:03] would become supercharged and that it
[3:10:05] would become a revelation
[3:10:08] and that it would be power and authority
[3:10:10] lord that you promised ye shahayah that
[3:10:13] you promised that this little bride
[3:10:15] would be able to flow through in the
[3:10:16] last days lord we believe in the full
[3:10:19] manifestation of the sons of god we
[3:10:21] believe in the power of the creative
[3:10:23] spoken word we believe it is our
[3:10:26] inheritance we believe lord that it is
[3:10:29] ours for the asking so we stand before
[3:10:32] you right now and say oh may the holy
[3:10:35] ghost take us to deeper depths may the
[3:10:38] holy ghost take us to higher heights
[3:10:41] may the holy ghost grant
[3:10:43] deeper greater
[3:10:45] revelation
[3:10:47] of what you are
[3:10:48] and what you have already provided you
[3:10:51] are the faithful one oh god maybe you
[3:10:54] just lay your hand on someone right next
[3:10:56] to you and you'd pray the same sort of
[3:10:58] prayer over them my brother my friend my
[3:11:01] neighbor
[3:11:02] oh god would you let faith become a
[3:11:04] greater reality
[3:11:06] would you let these virtues become more
[3:11:09] manifold and more manifested
[3:11:12] in each of these lies
[3:11:14] my god would you give each one of these
[3:11:16] saints the strength to resist the lies
[3:11:18] of the devil
[3:11:20] we just rebuke and resist the enemy's
[3:11:22] lies right now in the name of jesus
[3:11:26] every time that enemy would come and say
[3:11:28] if you'd have just had more faith if
[3:11:30] you'd have just been more faithful if
[3:11:32] you'd have just done it this way or that
[3:11:33] way and the enemy tries to discourage
[3:11:36] and break us down i pray lord that you
[3:11:39] will come hallelujah that you will come
[3:11:42] and we will remember your faithfulness
[3:11:44] even through the hardship and even

[3:27:17] let's take him with us
[3:27:19] let's not leave him here let's take him
[3:27:21] with us as we go out i know you're weary
[3:27:24] and body tired you've been here for
[3:27:26] quite a while and you've listened thank
[3:27:28] you for every faith pull thank you for
[3:27:30] every amen
[3:27:31] thank you for every effort
[3:27:34] it's in times like this that we
[3:27:36] we really should reflect
[3:27:39] and think about all that goes in to
[3:27:42] making this possible
[3:27:43] to continue to do what we do for the
[3:27:45] lord
[3:27:46] i thought about the fact that hawk
[3:27:49] came over here last night i normally
[3:27:51] don't have my notes
[3:27:52] finished until sunday morning
[3:27:55] but hawk i knew that charity had offered
[3:27:58] to do them friday well they certainly
[3:27:59] weren't ready friday
[3:28:01] to put in the computer
[3:28:03] and hawk came over here and spent an
[3:28:04] hour and a half last night just putting
[3:28:06] in somewhat i didn't even get to
[3:28:09] but we never know what i'm going to get
[3:28:10] to
[3:28:11] i appreciate that
[3:28:13] appreciate him doing that and and these
[3:28:16] that have filled it on the music i know
[3:28:17] it's not easy because if you're not
[3:28:19] playing a song all the time
[3:28:22] you you know what you're just kind of
[3:28:23] thrown into it
[3:28:25] i just appreciate what every person does
[3:28:29] you that run the equipment and the
[3:28:31] streaming and and everything you do to
[3:28:34] give your prayer you who come early and
[3:28:36] pray and sanctify the atmosphere
[3:28:39] wave your flags and call on god to come
[3:28:41] and help us i appreciate that you that
[3:28:44] given the offering
[3:28:46] and pray for your pastor and pray for
[3:28:48] the work of the lord to continue
[3:28:51] just being here this morning we
[3:28:53] appreciate you so much
[3:28:55] very very much
[3:28:57] now i hate to even mention this but i'd
[3:28:59] like to just
[3:29:00] put this in as just a little bit of a
[3:29:01] reminder because i
[3:29:03] i'm also in charge of all the bills
[3:29:06] because there will not be a service here
[3:29:08] tuesday night and because there will not
[3:29:10] be a service on the first sunday just be
[3:29:12] mindful of that would you
[3:29:14] would you be mindful when you give
[3:29:16] online when you use our app it takes one
[3:29:18] to three weeks
[3:29:19] for us to get that money depending on
[3:29:21] your bank and the agreement that you
[3:29:22] have with our with our processor
[3:29:25] one to three weeks
[3:29:27] and so it could be that the first of the
[3:29:29] month would be a little difficult for us
[3:29:31] because the bills come to whether we're
[3:29:33] here having service or not so whatever
[3:29:35] the lord would put on your heart to put
[3:29:38] a little early or do do whatever
[3:29:40] whatever
[3:29:41] i just had to mention the fact that
[3:29:43] not having two services can make a
[3:29:46] real difference in church income
[3:29:48] you be mindful of that and i know you
[3:29:50] will because you are faithful
[3:29:53] i don't know that we could find more
[3:29:55] faithful people than what is represented
[3:29:57] here
[3:29:58] in this body
[3:30:00] i want to thank you one other little
[3:30:01] thing let me say this and i'll i'll
[3:30:04] remember to do it again when i get home
[3:30:05] but everything you've done for benjamin
[3:30:07] and jenna
[3:30:08] i want to thank you their cupboards are
[3:30:10] just filled
[3:30:12] i want to thank you for that thank you
[3:30:14] for bringing the food for them
[3:30:16] i want to thank you for the shower gifts
[3:30:19] and what the brothers give and
[3:30:21] for for our get-togethers for them
[3:30:26] we try to do the best we can for all of
[3:30:28] these young couples
[3:30:30] but i i really as a pastor and as a dad
[3:30:33] stacy and i we want to thank you for
[3:30:36] what you've it seems that you've gone a
[3:30:38] little beyond
[3:30:39] worked a little harder
[3:30:41] all the labor that's gone into
[3:30:43] transforming maw's
[3:30:46] mobile home that smelled like sam or dog
[3:30:50] into transforming that in into a nice
[3:30:53] place that they can live and
[3:30:55] you volunteered your time and your
[3:30:57] effort
[3:30:58] and sometimes your money
[3:31:00] because sometimes people ran to the
[3:31:02] store and got stuff and wouldn't even
[3:31:03] wouldn't even bring a receipt wouldn't
[3:31:05] wouldn't even be paid god sees every bit
[3:31:07] of that and every prayer you've prayed
[3:31:09] for them and every effort it's terribly
[3:31:12] expensive for those
[3:31:14] to go to texas who who have made that
[3:31:16] decision to help in that way may god
[3:31:18] give it back to you i know that it's a a
[3:31:20] wedding but
[3:31:22] you're giving it is unto the lord
[3:31:24] because you're doing it to honor
[3:31:26] the work of god here
[3:31:28] and i appreciate you doing that very
[3:31:30] much so may god give it back to you
[3:31:32] press down shaken together and running
[3:31:34] over
[3:31:35] you've made a dad's heart very very
[3:31:37] happy and pleased
[3:31:39] let's pray for those who are not able to
[3:31:42] go that they will be covered in peace
[3:31:45] and in the wonderful care of the lord
[3:31:48] and that in just a few
[3:31:50] days we'll be united again
[3:31:52] may we meet together in a higher place
[3:31:55] than what we say goodbye in today amen

[3:32:25] those who are not able to go along
