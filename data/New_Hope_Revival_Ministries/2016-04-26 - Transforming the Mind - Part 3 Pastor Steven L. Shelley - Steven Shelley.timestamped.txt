[0:15] hello I'm Pastor Steven Shelly of New
[0:17] Hope Revival ministries I want to share
[0:19] a couple things with you today about the
[0:22] power of our thoughts and the effect
[0:25] that they have on our entire body not
[0:27] just our spiritual life but also they
[0:30] can have a profound effect on our
[0:32] physical health we're we're working on a
[0:34] theme that the Lord dealt with me about
[0:37] last year and that was to become a
[0:40] better reflection of the message that we
[0:43] carry the revelation of Jesus Christ
[0:46] there's a scripture that is translated
[0:48] in in one translation that we would have
[0:51] soul Harmony that we would be in Harmony
[0:54] in our soul that's our mind our will and
[0:57] emotions did you know that if you keep
[0:59] thinking a a toxic thought a negative
[1:02] thought over and over again it is pushed
[1:05] farther and farther into the deeper
[1:07] recesses of your long-term memory until
[1:09] it actually becomes a part of who you
[1:11] are it becomes a part of your
[1:13] non-conscious brain and it's what you
[1:15] think about yourself even though it is
[1:18] probably if it's negative it's certainly
[1:20] not the truth because you're now a new
[1:22] creature in Jesus Christ and those
[1:24] thoughts can easily become strongholds
[1:27] that have to be brought down in the
[1:29] power and authority of the blood of
[1:31] Jesus Christ there's a scripture in the
[1:34] Bible in 2 Corinthians chapter 10 and
[1:36] verse three that talks about we're
[1:39] Waring we though we walk in the flesh
[1:42] we're not Waring In the Flesh for the
[1:44] weapons of our Warfare are not carnal
[1:46] But Mighty through God to the pulling
[1:48] down of strongholds in the complete
[1:50] Jewish Bible it says this because the
[1:53] weapons we use to wage war are not
[1:56] worldly on the contrary they have God's
[2:00] power for demolishing strongholds we
[2:03] demolish arguments and every arrogance
[2:07] that raises itself up against the
[2:10] knowledge of God that means that with
[2:12] the weapons that we have the word of God
[2:15] the blood of Jesus Christ the precious
[2:18] name of Jesus Yeshua our Messiah what
[2:21] more could we ask for these weapons are
[2:24] powerful enough to demolish strongholds
[2:27] of bad thinking tox
[2:30] accusations that you're wiring into your
[2:33] brain in fact the scripture says that we
[2:35] can demolish arguments because sometimes
[2:38] that's what thoughts are arguments
[2:40] between Satan's accusations our puny
[2:43] defense of ourselves because uh against
[2:46] the enemy on our own we're not a match
[2:48] it's only because of who lives in us
[2:51] that we have authority to demolish his
[2:53] arguments and it says that we should
[2:56] have authority in King James it says
[2:58] casting down every imagination here it
[3:01] says every arrogance that raises itself
[3:04] up against the knowledge of God so I
[3:06] want you to know you have power and
[3:08] authority to demolish arguments
[3:12] strongholds that Satan has been telling
[3:15] you over and over and over again now is
[3:19] the time you have the grace being
[3:22] extended to the body of Christ in this
[3:24] hour to have our minds completely
[3:27] renewed and by the renewing of our minds
[3:30] our brain actually follows our thoughts
[3:33] so if we think better thoughts more
[3:35] Godly thoughts hiding the word of God in
[3:38] our heart our brain will follow in fact
[3:42] the chemicals that are released in our
[3:44] body when we operate under stress can be
[3:47] so detrimental in the long term but the
[3:50] chemicals that that we release in the
[3:52] body our brain releases in the body when
[3:55] we think on God's thoughts God's word
[3:58] when we think on those things the
[4:00] chemicals that are released bring health
[4:02] and healing to our entire body I want to
[4:05] walk in wholeness and in Soul Harmony
[4:09] and I know you do too and it's possible
[4:12] by meditating on the word of God Thy
[4:14] word have I hid in my heart that I might
[4:17] not sin against thee Oh God and when we
[4:20] believe the devil's lies we're sinning
[4:22] against God's word we're arguing with
[4:25] what God has said we are and let me tell
[4:27] you something I was junk but not to God
[4:31] and when he filled me with the Holy
[4:33] Ghost when Jesus came to live in my
[4:35] heart I'm telling you he made me what I
[4:38] am and God doesn't make junk does he and
[4:41] I know it sounds so simple but it's true
[4:43] practice it today practice confessing
[4:47] God's promises over your life and
[4:49] practice pulling down those strongholds
[4:53] and accusations that Satan throws your
[4:55] way God bless you I'll see you again
