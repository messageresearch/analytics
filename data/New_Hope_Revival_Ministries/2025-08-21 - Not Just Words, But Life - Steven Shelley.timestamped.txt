[0:00] So, we've got to learn also how to take
[0:02] this great revelation of the word and
[0:04] not be puffed up with bride pride,
[0:07] &gt;&gt; but begin to bring it down to such a
[0:10] place where we can live it very
[0:11] practically
[0:12] &gt;&gt; in our life with our children, with our
[0:15] grandchildren, with our with our church
[0:17] faith community.
[0:21] Because in an environment like that
[0:23] where we know when someone stumbles, we
[0:26] know and we go to prayer and we don't
[0:28] condemn and we don't judge motives and
[0:30] we don't put them in hell, but we begin
[0:33] to try to rescue them first in prayer
[0:35] &gt;&gt; before you put your mouth on any
[0:37] situation as a believer.
[0:41] &gt;&gt; We go to prayer first
[0:43] &gt;&gt; and we ask God for wisdom.
[0:45] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you, he's got it.
[0:47] &gt;&gt; He is the ancient of days. Amen.
[0:50] &gt;&gt; He has all wisdom in his hands.
[0:53] &gt;&gt; All wisdom. And he knows how to help us.
[0:55] Yeah. I'm telling you, this is the hour.
[0:58] This is actually the most important
[1:00] generation
[1:01] &gt;&gt; perhaps that there that there's ever
[1:03] been. It is more important than the 50s
[1:06] and 60s. And I know that's hard for some
[1:08] folks around the message to say, but it
[1:10] is. It's much more important because the
[1:12] word that God delivered in that
[1:15] generation is more precious and more
[1:17] applicable even to the day and hour
[1:19] we're living in right now than it ever
[1:22] was. And if it's ever going to produce
[1:24] the life of Christ, it has to do it now.
[1:27] If there's ever going to be overcoming
[1:29] Christians, they have to be in this
[1:31] hour. If there's ever going to be fully
[1:32] adopted sons, they've got to step up
[1:35] now. No.
[1:39] [Applause]
[1:42] He didn't come so that all that would
[1:43] come out of our mouth, as brother Bram
[1:45] said, brother Bram said, Brother Bram
[1:46] said,
[1:47] &gt;&gt; he came so that we could get a hold of
[1:49] this word, we could eat it
[1:51] &gt;&gt; and digest it and unpack it until we
[1:56] become it.
[1:58] &gt;&gt; The living word, that's the
[2:00] transformation that has to take place in
[2:02] this hour. Yes.
[2:04] &gt;&gt; And and the only way I know is to spend
[2:06] enough time in that pavilion,
[2:09] &gt;&gt; in that secret place with this with
[2:12] Christ the word.
[2:15] &gt;&gt; If I go in the secret place with Christ
[2:18] the word,
[2:19] &gt;&gt; this must produce a change.
[2:23] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:24] &gt;&gt; And what we really want is for him to
[2:26] whisper in our ear what we need to work
[2:29] on. Wouldn't that be lovely?
[2:34] &gt;&gt; You just come real, real quiet, and tell
[2:37] me what I need to do different, and I'm
[2:39] going to work on it now, Jesus. But
[2:41] that's not the prayer that this psalmist
[2:42] was praying.
[2:45] He was literally, if you look at the
[2:47] original words, he was saying, "Expose
[2:49] me.
[2:51] Rip off the charade,
[2:55] the facade.
[2:59] dig to the deepest part of who I am
[3:03] &gt;&gt; and let me see my own heart and let me
[3:06] see my own emotions
[3:09] and let me see my own response
[3:12] so that I can throw it before you
[3:18] and be new. The Amplified said, "Examine
[3:21] me, oh Lord, and prove me and test my
[3:24] heart and test my mind
[3:27] and see who I am." And that can't always
[3:31] come with a whisper. It sometimes has to
[3:34] come through public gaze.
[3:38] And nobody wants to hear such a thing.
