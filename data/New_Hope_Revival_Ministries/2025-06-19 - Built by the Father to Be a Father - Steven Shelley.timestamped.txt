[0:00] To be the father that you're called to
[0:02] be, you've got to learn to relate first
[0:05] and foremost to your heavenly father.
[0:08] And this is where things break down.
[0:13] In order to be a good father,
[0:16] you've got to know you have one.
[0:19] And you've got to understand that he's
[0:21] not out to destroy you. He's out to
[0:24] build you, to make you somebody, to make
[0:27] you something, to give you strength, to
[0:29] be everything that he has created and
[0:32] called you to be. A man who doesn't have
[0:35] a good relationship with his heavenly
[0:37] father will struggle in everyday
[0:40] fatherhood.
[0:42] The more you fall in love with your
[0:44] heavenly father, the more you learn to
[0:47] relate with your heavenly father and
[0:49] hear the heart of your heavenly father,
[0:52] the better father you'll be to your
[0:54] children. If a man will walk upright
[0:57] before the Lord with discretion in all
[1:00] of his affairs, it's the desire of the
[1:03] Lord to bless that man with favor.
[1:07] When we sense the favor of the Lord
[1:10] withdrawing from our lives, and I have
[1:13] on more than one occasion uh during my
[1:16] life, when we sense his favor
[1:18] withdrawing from us, that's not the time
[1:21] to get bitter. That's not the time to
[1:24] get cold and indifferent. That's the
[1:26] time to go to the altar. In fact, that's
[1:29] the time to be chained to the altar,
[1:32] grabbing a hold of the horns of the
[1:34] altar and saying, "Lord, I won't be
[1:37] moved until you show me what it is in my
[1:40] life that's caused your favor to
[1:42] withdraw." I want you to know the love
[1:44] of the Lord will never leave you. But
[1:47] the favor and the blessing of the Lord
[1:50] will leave you high and dry if you're
[1:53] not walking in his ways and his
[1:55] commandments. If a man's ways please the
[1:59] Lord,
[2:01] he he's not only to bless and provide,
[2:03] able to do that, but he's also able to
[2:05] make his own enemies be at peace with
[2:07] him.
[2:08] That's the goodness of God. I'm thankful
[2:11] for it. Godly fathers in this hour are
[2:15] like lighthouse towers, rooted in the
[2:18] word. They've already weathered their
[2:20] own personal storms. They have found
[2:23] themselves a place of being steadfast,
[2:26] unmovable in their faith. They're not
[2:29] looking for the trends and the newer
[2:31] ways, but their roots go down deeper.
[2:34] The more the winds blow, the more the
[2:36] adversaries come, the deeper their roots
[2:39] go down in their faith. They're not
[2:42] nearly as emotional
[2:45] as they get more mature. Their fears are
[2:49] fewer and farther between. because
[2:52] they're learning to put their whole
[2:54] trust and their whole hope in the Lord.
[2:58] We want to acknowledge this morning
[2:59] every father in this house who prays for
[3:02] his children. And I don't mean a mambby
[3:05] pami lay me down prayer. I mean the kind
[3:08] that rattles the bars of hell and rings
[3:12] the bells of heaven. one that says,
[3:15] "I've got the faith of a bulldog, and
[3:18] I'm going to put my jaw down on the
[3:21] promise of God, and I'm going to believe
[3:24] for my children." How many of you have
[3:27] ever uh had to go before the Lord and
[3:29] say, "Wait a minute. Take your hands off
[3:34] of my family."
[3:36] This is not only a mother's duty, it is
[3:40] primarily the duty of a father.
[3:44] You back up, you foul spirit. I won't
[3:47] have it because somebody else agrees
[3:49] with it. I won't have it because
[3:51] somebody else accepts it. I'm going to
[3:54] stand on the word and believe that God
[3:56] will drive back the forces of hell. The
[3:59] devil better take his hands off of my
[4:01] children, my family, my grandchildren.
[4:05] Come on. I'm telling you, we can do some
[4:07] business in the spirit. Let me tell you
[4:10] something. Dads aren't going to be
[4:11] perfect. I don't know any I don't know
[4:15] any I don't know any perfect children.
[4:17] So that's good.
[4:19] They're not going to be perfect. They're
[4:21] not always going to get it right. But if
[4:23] they are there for you,
[4:26] that's something to celebrate.
[4:29] If they won't compromise with your sin,
[4:33] that's something to celebrate. If
[4:36] they'll tell you the truth instead of
[4:38] what you want to hear, that's something
[4:40] to celebrate.
