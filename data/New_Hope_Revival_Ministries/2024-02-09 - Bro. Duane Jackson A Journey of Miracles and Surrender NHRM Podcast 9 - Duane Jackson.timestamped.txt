[0:42] seen so far and has been a blessing to
[0:44] me and um I I pray that something that
[0:47] could be said today would would be
[0:49] uplifting to somebody else I like I said
[0:52] I appreciate you coming on being willing
[0:53] to do it and even stay in an extra day
[0:55] just to be able to do this with me um
[0:58] but we're just going to jump into it I'd
[0:59] love to hear
[1:00] your
[1:01] testimony you know how where you born
[1:04] raised and and how you came to the
[1:07] lord well
[1:09] um I was I was born into a Christian
[1:13] home um the my parents both were um
[1:18] already Believers uh within the message
[1:20] my mom's uncle was the pastor of the
[1:23] church that they attended brother henard
[1:25] Green in Ruth North Carolina so I I felt
[1:29] for that um in looking back that I was
[1:32] born into a family that already um was a
[1:37] a solid Christian family and Believers
[1:41] of end time message and um it took me a
[1:46] long time in my life uh to to grow to a
[1:49] place that I
[1:50] understood that just because they had an
[1:54] experience and I had witnessed God
[1:57] moving in their life it took me me um
[2:00] took me quite a few years up into my
[2:02] teens to really understand that I had to
[2:06] have that same experience and it it
[2:09] wasn't just good enough uh that my dad
[2:12] sure had great personal experiences and
[2:15] I witnessed things happening in in his
[2:18] life and in my mom's life it it just
[2:20] took me a little bit of time to
[2:22] recognize that um them having the Holy
[2:26] Ghost wasn't the same as me having the
[2:28] everybody's got to have their own
[2:30] experience each one of us have to have
[2:33] our own personal experience and um I I'm
[2:37] I'm thankful that that God revealed that
[2:39] to me um it was sometimes I I feel that
[2:41] it's um even difficult for young people
[2:45] growing up in a uh a Christian home and
[2:48] in a in a um a church group that that
[2:52] follows the teaching of brother brandom
[2:55] to to really realize that just by going
[3:00] to church is not enough um just by
[3:03] following some rules um some boundaries
[3:06] that have been placed before them uh my
[3:09] parents did that for me they they placed
[3:11] boundaries and I I didn't always abide
[3:14] by them and uh they gave me Grace and
[3:18] actually just just recently I was
[3:19] talking with my mom um about a situation
[3:23] and and she's like we knew the things
[3:27] that was going on she said but we prayed
[3:29] for you every single day and we prayed
[3:32] that God would show you that the things
[3:35] that you the places you were going the
[3:37] things you were doing were not of him
[3:41] and and he did he he he revealed that to
[3:44] me um he he he came down in a special
[3:48] way for
[3:49] me in
[3:52] 1988 um I was at a Bible camp that was
[3:55] being put on uh by brother Mike sever um
[3:59] up in
[4:00] um up in Ohio it was Ohio and um I'd
[4:05] went to the camp quite a few times and
[4:09] this particular year that we went the
[4:12] camp had been double
[4:14] booked and so they had two groups of
[4:17] people trying to come in and stay at the
[4:20] campground at the very same week and it
[4:24] was a I I remember the day that we got
[4:26] there and everything was um just a mess
[4:30] and they were trying to figure out what
[4:31] they were going to do so our group ended
[4:35] up having to go to a Boy Scout camp so
[4:37] it took a little bit of time and they
[4:38] got everybody moved over to a Boy Scout
[4:41] camp and they set up a makeshift um uh
[4:46] area to have a pull pit and and uh a
[4:49] stage they actually pulled a um just a
[4:51] flatbed trailer out into a field and set
[4:55] up a tent and set up chairs and that's
[4:59] that's where we had Church set up the
[5:01] the organ and the piano and um they were
[5:05] having to wire in some light bulbs and
[5:08] stuff so we could have some light in
[5:10] there but it was during that
[5:12] meeting that the Lord came down and
[5:15] dealt with me directly and it was all
[5:18] the way to the end of the week um it was
[5:21] a Friday night and that evening the the
[5:26] after the service was
[5:28] over um and the anointing was was moving
[5:31] there was a lot of people that was
[5:32] praying and staying Under the
[5:35] Tent I left at as they said you could be
[5:38] dismissed I left out from the
[5:41] tent and behind the tent up on the hill
[5:45] there was a a basketball court and I'd
[5:48] walked up to the to that area but it was
[5:51] still within ear shock of what was going
[5:53] on at the down at the tent and I was
[5:56] standing around watching the guys play
[5:58] some basketball and I really wasn't into
[6:02] playing basketball but I just wanted to
[6:03] be around them but as I stood there I
[6:06] kept hearing the music being played and
[6:10] I said well I'm just going to go and and
[6:13] walk back down to the tent and just kind
[6:15] of hang around outside the
[6:17] tent so I did that for a little bit I I
[6:21] stood there and just listened to the the
[6:23] music being played and hearing the
[6:24] people praying and then finally I said
[6:28] well I'll just I'll slip inside and just
[6:30] sit on the back seat I tired standing up
[6:33] so I'll just I'll just sit on the back
[6:35] row and and I I love music so I just
[6:39] wanted to listen to the music that's
[6:40] what I thought um so I I go in and and
[6:45] actually think there was some people in
[6:46] the very back so I found a row that
[6:49] there wasn't many people and I slipped
[6:50] in and sat down
[6:52] and don't know how long I was there but
[6:56] I do what I remember is that
[7:00] at some
[7:01] point I found myself kneeling at that
[7:05] chair old metal
[7:07] chair I was kneeling on the grass and
[7:12] praying and I could feel that that God
[7:15] was drawing me and pulling me and I just
[7:19] started praying and I just I was praying
[7:21] I said Lord I don't I don't even know
[7:23] what to say I don't know what I supposed
[7:26] to do I I know that I need you and I
[7:30] don't know who it was to this day I
[7:32] don't know who it was it might have been
[7:35] an angel that that came down and place
[7:37] their hands upon my back but at one
[7:40] point I felt hands wrapped around my
[7:44] shoulders oh and voices praying I never
[7:48] opened my eyes I don't know who it was
[7:52] but they prayed with me for 20 minutes
[7:55] or or or more praying and and their
[7:58] voice and their voice they were praying
[8:00] that I would be filled with the Holy
[8:02] Ghost and it was that Friday night that
[8:06] God came down and placed a portion of
[8:09] himself in my heart and in my life and
[8:12] changed my life I mean completely
[8:14] changed my life um the directions that I
[8:17] had things that I thought that I wanted
[8:19] to do um completely changed and uh I I I
[8:24] knew that I had I had given myself to
[8:28] him and received him into my
[8:31] life and then you know I was still in
[8:34] high school and still involved in in
[8:37] music uh within
[8:39] school
[8:42] and even though I'd had an
[8:46] experience I did not
[8:49] always yield myself fully to that
[8:54] um I allowed myself to um to vary and
[9:00] and stray in in different aspects of my
[9:02] life and and do things and and
[9:06] that uh it's not edifying and and don't
[9:09] like to bring those those things up
[9:11] because I know that God has pulled me
[9:13] from those things and and took me out of
[9:17] that but I went through um finished
[9:20] finished high school in uh
[9:24] 1990 um heavily involved in in the music
[9:28] Within school and then within church and
[9:33] I felt that things was just you know I
[9:35] was doing what I was supposed to do when
[9:36] I was yeah going to church and you know
[9:39] that's I was uh making my mom and dad
[9:42] happy because that's where they wanted
[9:44] to see me in church and but I had never
[9:48] gotten to the place that I really fully
[9:52] surrendered everything over to him um I
[9:56] was still holding things back you know
[9:58] it it took me a while to to realize that
[10:01] I I watched my my friends that were in
[10:05] in my same
[10:07] age um at church getting married and and
[10:11] move on and start having children and it
[10:14] just didn't seem like that was my lot um
[10:18] at the time um and and until quite a few
[10:23] years later before I ended up meeting um
[10:27] Heather um with would become my wife
[10:30] shortly after we met
[10:33] um we actually met due to a
[10:38] um a mutual friend that was getting
[10:42] married
[10:44] um I had a passion for
[10:47] photography um there for for a while and
[10:51] and I had went and purchased different
[10:53] types of equipment and and gotten really
[10:56] involved in in doing photography and and
[10:59] some friends of ours found out and they
[11:02] found out that I had taken uh some
[11:04] wedding pictures for a couple other
[11:06] people and so they they asked would you
[11:09] be willing to come and uh do the the
[11:12] photography for our daughter's wedding
[11:14] and it was going to happen over in
[11:16] Gastonia North
[11:18] Carolina and I said sure be happy
[11:20] to and um so I go to that wedding and
[11:24] that was um June the 8th of 20
[11:30] 3 and on that day I had no clue that
[11:35] that was going to be a day that
[11:37] absolutely changed my life
[11:39] forever because it was a young lady that
[11:43] her family I was mutual friends with the
[11:46] one getting married and so they had come
[11:48] up from Georgia to attend the
[11:52] wedding after the wedding was over um my
[11:57] pastor who was brother Dan daisley um at
[12:00] that
[12:01] time he spoke with brother Daniel G and
[12:05] D who was um Heather's pastor and they
[12:09] were there at the wedding together and
[12:10] he invited him to come to our church and
[12:12] Minister on that that following Sunday
[12:15] so they did they came to church and I
[12:18] happened to be the one that was leading
[12:19] the songs that morning I wish I could
[12:23] remember what songs I sang that day I
[12:26] wish I would have written them down um
[12:29] but during the song
[12:31] service um I was singing a song and I
[12:35] kind of looked up at the
[12:37] congregation and noticed that there was
[12:40] a young lady sitting over on the
[12:41] left-and
[12:43] side that was just absolutely beautiful
[12:47] and completely lost the words to the
[12:51] song that I was
[12:53] singing I just I could not remember
[12:55] where I was at and I was I it took me a
[12:58] few few moments to find where we were
[13:00] with this the songs but I could not keep
[13:03] my mind off of her and um I was trying
[13:06] to pay attention to what I was supposed
[13:08] to be doing the song service but she
[13:11] caught my eye and it was it was I had
[13:14] heard throughout my life that um you
[13:17] would just know you know whenever you
[13:19] meet the right one you would just know I
[13:21] didn't know that it was going to take me
[13:22] 30 years to meet the right one
[13:26] um but whenever I saw her and it was
[13:29] just something something about her her
[13:31] smile just caught my eye and I I could
[13:34] not keep from looking over I would try
[13:36] to try to keep but I couldn't I keep
[13:39] looking over and seeing her there and um
[13:43] so I started asking questions um to
[13:47] those that came with her to find out who
[13:49] she was you know who with her parents
[13:53] and um whether or not cuz at the time
[13:57] she was she was holding a little baby
[13:58] baby um and that had gave me a little
[14:01] pause for concern I was like surely
[14:04] that's not her baby and it wasn't it was
[14:06] a cousin of hers that she was
[14:10] holding so I I contacted um I guess it
[14:14] was about a week and a half after that
[14:17] um I didn't get to speak to her I don't
[14:20] think I shook her hand that day at
[14:22] church I was too nervous um but I did
[14:25] speak to her or I think I spoke to her
[14:27] dad and at that time we were in the
[14:30] process of uh building a new
[14:33] sanctuary and they had recently upgraded
[14:36] some sound equipment in their sanctuary
[14:40] and he told me he said well I was kind
[14:42] of one of the ones that's helping take
[14:44] charge of sound equipment and he said um
[14:47] he said why don't you come down and you
[14:49] can visit our church sometime and you
[14:51] can see the sound equipment so I
[14:54] accepted that invitation quickly and um
[14:58] and went down but in between that time I
[15:00] had called her
[15:02] pastor and inquired about her to find
[15:06] out if she was um you know if she was
[15:09] already talking with someone
[15:11] and if if he if he felt that I was um
[15:15] would be out of line because of uh I
[15:18] didn't I found out that her her age was
[15:21] a little bit younger than me uh about 13
[15:23] years younger than I and uh so I I
[15:27] didn't want it to be
[15:29] super awkward to try to talk with her
[15:31] and then offend someone um so I talked
[15:34] with him and and he said you know I I I
[15:37] think you'd be okay you know you you'd
[15:39] be received if you was to talk with her
[15:42] dad and
[15:44] um so um about 3 weeks after um well
[15:49] that was June the 8th it was um July the
[15:53] 5th um we I went down they were having a
[15:57] a function at their Church and um some
[16:00] activities as such um celebrating the
[16:03] July 4th uh weekend and so I went
[16:07] down and um the women I all went off to
[16:11] for some function they were doing and
[16:13] the the brothers had went up to uh Bass
[16:16] Pro Shop and uh so I took that um chance
[16:20] to go and hang out and be around her dad
[16:23] for a little bit cuz didn't know him he
[16:25] didn't know me and we got back from the
[16:27] bass proo shop and
[16:30] um we um we were sitting out in his um
[16:34] in his
[16:34] driveway and in my in my Jeep and um I
[16:39] spoke to him for about an hour and a
[16:41] half sitting in his
[16:43] driveway um all this time I didn't know
[16:45] that Heather and her mom and her sister
[16:48] were in the house looking out the window
[16:50] and she's like why is he out there
[16:53] talking to Dad for that that long what
[16:55] what is going
[16:57] on but I expressed to her
[17:00] Dan that
[17:03] um that I would like to court his
[17:06] daughter um and not long before that
[17:11] happened I had done a lot of reading um
[17:16] through the different messages of uh
[17:20] concerning dating and courtship and I
[17:25] felt that that was the correct way to
[17:29] approach um even though I had not even
[17:31] spoken to her to ask her if she would
[17:34] was interested in me so you hadn't said
[17:36] anything to her I said nothing I had sh
[17:39] I had shook her hand at one of the
[17:41] services at their church and we had all
[17:44] as a group had went out to eat and she
[17:46] was babysitting that little the little
[17:49] girl again and I think I made a comment
[17:52] of oh I see your babysitting again that
[17:56] was the extent of our conversations that
[17:58] we had had up to this
[18:00] point so I talked with her dad for a
[18:03] long time and I asked him uh I wanted
[18:07] his permission um to court his daughter
[18:11] and he said um he said well AB that the
[18:14] finality of it he says I will talk to
[18:17] her see if she's interested if she would
[18:20] like to be courted by you or not and
[18:22] then I'll let you
[18:23] know and I didn't want to wait too long
[18:27] said I already waited long enough I
[18:29] didn't want to wait too long so he um I
[18:33] stayed in the in the Jeep for a little
[18:36] bit and he went inside and Heather's
[18:40] story to me um is that when he came in
[18:44] they were all you know what is going on
[18:47] and she said that he you know sat down
[18:50] with her um in the living room and he he
[18:53] said I'm just going to tell you how it
[18:55] is he said um he likes you a lot
[18:59] and um he wants to court you and I feel
[19:03] if you say yes that you're that you'll
[19:06] accept his courtship you'll probably end
[19:08] up getting
[19:10] married and she said
[19:13] okay and that was it that was how that
[19:17] was how it was and and from then that
[19:20] evening a group of people was going out
[19:23] to uh Longhorn um Steakhouse and so show
[19:28] up to pick her up well to Rite actually
[19:31] I think I rode with her mom and dad and
[19:33] her and we all rode together to longor
[19:37] and we're sitting at
[19:38] longor and I'm thinking
[19:42] recording and we really don't know each
[19:45] other yet and uh it was a little awkward
[19:48] at at the beginning um but it didn't
[19:51] stay awkward too long um that happened
[19:55] July the 5th of 20
[20:01] three is that right yeah 2003 and
[20:06] then I proposed to her
[20:10] August the
[20:12] 23rd of 2003 wow that was how serious I
[20:17] was that that's how I how how I knew
[20:20] that we were meant for each other and
[20:23] then she was the one that that I had
[20:26] been waiting for and
[20:28] so I proposed August the 23rd and then
[20:32] we got married November 22nd of the same
[20:35] year
[20:37] 2003 and um like most um you know Newly
[20:43] Weds and uh married couples they have a
[20:47] desire to um to have children and we we
[20:52] had that same desire we we both um both
[20:56] wanted to have a family um I I only I
[21:00] had two siblings two sisters um she um
[21:03] she only had one sister um but my dad's
[21:07] family and my mom's family were both
[21:09] large families my dad came out of a
[21:10] family of 12 kids oh wow he was the
[21:13] seventh child out of 12 and my mom came
[21:17] out of a family of seven so I was used
[21:20] to having a lot of cousins and aunts and
[21:22] uncles around um so we we both wanted to
[21:27] have children
[21:28] and um and just
[21:31] expected that it would come easy we we
[21:35] saw so many other other of our friends
[21:37] that would get married and you know
[21:40] within a year or so you know they're
[21:43] already pregnant and having having
[21:45] children come
[21:46] on and
[21:48] um so
[21:51] about 15 months I guess it was
[21:55] into um our marriage age uh she became
[22:00] pregnant I guess about 14 months she
[22:02] became
[22:04] pregnant and um and then about eight I
[22:10] think she was about eight weeks along
[22:12] eight or 10 weeks along and um we
[22:15] experienced a
[22:17] miscarriage um which was very was very
[22:22] difficult um put a a lot of strain um on
[22:26] the on the two of us
[22:28] um emotional spiritual strain sure um
[22:33] didn't understand you know why is it why
[22:35] is it easy for some and and not easy for
[22:38] others and um we really felt that that
[22:42] that was God's plan for us was to to
[22:45] have
[22:46] children and so after the um the time of
[22:50] the miscarriage um we went on for
[22:54] several years just
[22:56] expecting that that um that it would
[22:59] happen and month after month and months
[23:03] turn into years and still not happening
[23:07] and it really um it really put a strain
[23:11] um between the two of us um not so much
[23:16] a rift between the two of us but it was
[23:18] just a a strain a battle um trying to
[23:22] understand why there would be a delay
[23:25] for sure why you know we can't we go to
[23:28] the doctors and speak to the doctors and
[23:30] they're like we don't see any any reason
[23:33] why you shouldn't be able to have
[23:34] children and they would just keep saying
[23:36] it's just unexplained infertility uh
[23:40] would be the term that they would use
[23:43] and that's not always easy to to receive
[23:46] you don't you when you go to the doctor
[23:48] you're you're hoping and expecting that
[23:50] they're going to give you a reason and
[23:52] you're looking for answers and looking
[23:54] for answers and looking
[23:55] for for what can I do to change change
[23:58] it and they never could give us um a
[24:03] reason and they just every time it would
[24:06] be unexplained
[24:08] unexplained and so we we talked um
[24:12] between the two of us and along with uh
[24:15] one of my aunts who had
[24:17] adopted um went through the adoption
[24:20] process because she had been told that
[24:22] she would never be able to have children
[24:25] and so she had become a foster parent
[24:28] and then
[24:30] adopted and then shortly after she
[24:32] adopted about a year later and at that
[24:35] time she was 40 um she became pregnant
[24:38] oh wow on on her own after clinically
[24:42] they said that there was no way well
[24:44] that she could have a child and so she
[24:47] became pregnant and um and carried you
[24:50] know she has now she has a son that she
[24:52] adopted and a daughter U that was
[24:54] natural
[24:56] born so we we talked about the um
[25:01] possibility of becoming foster parents
[25:03] and and looked into
[25:07] adopting and um every time that we would
[25:10] go and contact the local DSS
[25:14] office the the dates that they would
[25:16] have for the classes always fell um at
[25:20] least one of the dates each week fell on
[25:23] our church night for our week night
[25:25] service and I not told Heather I said I
[25:28] just don't feel that that is God's
[25:32] leading for me to Mis Church mhm sure to
[25:36] go to become a foster parent I believe
[25:39] if he if that is his true uh if that's
[25:41] going to be an Avenue that he uses for
[25:43] us I believe he will he will open it up
[25:47] and not cause me to miss church just to
[25:50] try to force and push that because to me
[25:53] I felt like that would be me really
[25:55] trying to make something happen when
[25:57] maybe God was putting his hand on it and
[26:00] saying that's not my direction that I
[26:02] want you to go right
[26:04] now so we had tried um for about a year
[26:08] year and a half or so we would contact
[26:10] them each time the knights was going to
[26:13] be on a uh our church
[26:17] night so um in the year
[26:22] 2008
[26:24] um we had seen a um um a little live
[26:29] play
[26:30] where bunch of the kids and adults and
[26:33] acting out a play um and it was called
[26:35] The Box c car
[26:38] children and in that that
[26:42] play um it was talking about um like
[26:45] your kids without homes and such and we
[26:48] we when we both left from that we both
[26:51] were very emotional um it was supposed
[26:55] to be you know fun and everything I used
[26:57] to listen to the like CDs of it right so
[27:01] when we left we became very emotional
[27:03] and I was like I really want to I really
[27:06] want to have that I want to have I want
[27:09] to help take care of children that for
[27:12] whatever reason they're not able to be
[27:15] with their biological uh parents um for
[27:18] whatever
[27:20] reason and so we talked more about
[27:24] it we were coming into the January of
[27:28] 2009 and I told her I said well why
[27:31] don't you just call one more time and
[27:35] see maybe something you know maybe they
[27:37] have another class that's coming up and
[27:40] maybe we can even then I had gotten to
[27:43] the point that I said it's only going to
[27:46] be maybe a few you know a few church
[27:49] services that we have to miss over the
[27:50] next few months let me we'll think about
[27:54] it I I'd got to that that point
[27:58] so we she
[28:00] contacted um she called the local DSS
[28:03] office and they said well actually in
[28:06] two weeks we have um another class
[28:08] that's getting ready to start and always
[28:12] the next question is going to
[28:13] be or do you have space available and
[28:17] what nights is it and they said well
[28:21] actually this time we've changed our
[28:24] meetings our classes are going to be on
[28:26] a Monday night and a Thursday night
[28:28] well and we're like well that's
[28:31] perfect cuz we at that time our church
[28:34] had Church on Tuesday nights and most
[28:37] other churches in our area had churches
[28:38] on Wednesday nights so they they
[28:40] wouldn't have the classes on Wednesday
[28:42] night because they knew that that would
[28:43] conflict but they would usually have it
[28:45] on Tuesday and Thursday so this time
[28:48] they said we're going to have it on
[28:49] Monday and Thursday and she said well
[28:52] how do you have any spots available they
[28:54] said we have two spots left in the class
[28:57] and and she immediately she said please
[28:59] put our
[29:00] name on
[29:02] that so we started we went for our first
[29:06] they called it map
[29:08] classes um to become certified for
[29:12] become foster
[29:14] parents the starting date for our
[29:17] classes was January the 26th of
[29:20] 2009 we went through the classes during
[29:24] the classes about 6 weeks into it the
[29:27] came to us and had a uh a
[29:30] photograph of a little boy a little
[29:33] little baby boy um that um was born with
[29:38] clef lip and cleft pallet and they said
[29:41] um you know we have this little little
[29:43] boy that um is going to be needing a
[29:46] forever
[29:47] home and would you guys be interested
[29:52] and bringing him into your
[29:54] home knowing that he has this condition
[29:58] and the two hea or not both looked at
[30:00] each other and we're
[30:01] like the condition doesn't matter yeah
[30:05] it doesn't matter that that there may
[30:07] have you know something with cleft
[30:09] pallet all the all that can be that can
[30:11] be fixed and can be worked with and we
[30:14] even both said to each other if we had a
[30:16] child born yeah with that we're not
[30:19] going to cast them aside just because
[30:21] just because they had that so we said
[30:25] yes we would love to have him in our
[30:28] home if it can work out that way so
[30:31] several months went by beyond that I
[30:35] really didn't hear anything from them
[30:37] till after we had completed the classes
[30:40] and um I guess we were maybe about 6
[30:45] months um from the from the date that we
[30:48] had
[30:49] started and then they come to us and
[30:52] they said uh we are going to have to
[30:54] move um Jaden his name was Jaden we have
[30:57] to move Jaden from the home he in and he
[31:00] needs to be placed into a permanent
[31:02] forever home are you guys still
[31:05] available and we said yes so at about
[31:09] seven or eight months um Jaden was
[31:12] brought into our home and and I I loved
[31:16] how you explain what is the name because
[31:17] that was the name that was given to him
[31:19] what do his name is Jaden means Jehovah
[31:22] has heard wow and that was the name that
[31:23] was that was the name that was given to
[31:26] him by his birth par well we didn't we
[31:29] didn't choose it it was already chosen
[31:31] for him and it it was so fitting when we
[31:35] when I heard that his name was Jaden I'm
[31:38] like yes Jehovah has hurt yeah he heard
[31:41] our cry he heard our prayer and answered
[31:44] it because we had such a love and a
[31:46] desire to have children in our home and
[31:51] he other things were delayed in order
[31:54] for him to be placed into our home
[31:58] well as the transfer was taking place
[32:01] they have documents and things that they
[32:03] they bring and they go over things with
[32:05] you things like their birth date and um
[32:09] when they told us his birth date that is
[32:12] he was actually born on January the 26th
[32:16] of 2009 the very day that we began our
[32:21] classes to become foster parents it just
[32:25] it blew me away yeah everything lining
[32:28] up that and that that was not a
[32:29] coincidence yeah for sure for him to
[32:31] have been born the very same day that we
[32:34] started and um it just
[32:37] it it just amazes me how how God works
[32:40] and how he moves and um but we still you
[32:45] know we we still even though we were
[32:46] bring we brought him in to our home he
[32:49] was the
[32:51] third foster
[32:54] child thinking about that but I might
[32:56] should have asked as Heather I believe
[32:58] it's the third foster child uh that was
[33:01] in our home um we ultimately we did
[33:06] foster care for nine oh wow I did not
[33:09] know yeah total of nine children wow and
[33:12] out of the nine children that we did
[33:14] foster care for we adopted two um Jaden
[33:17] be our being our first that we adopted
[33:21] and then uh samanah being our
[33:24] second that we adopted and uh Savannah
[33:28] came to us she was um she was only 4
[33:31] days old um we actually went to the
[33:34] hospital and brought her home from the
[33:37] hospital um 4 days old and uh she had a
[33:41] lot of uh difficulties within her body
[33:45] um due to um things that the the
[33:48] biological mom had had done um while she
[33:52] was pregnant and um so there was some
[33:55] conditions that we had to to work with
[33:58] um but she's you know Savannah now is
[34:00] almost 13 13 years old Jaden just turned
[34:03] 15 years old and we were thinking that
[34:07] um you know God had really blessed us
[34:09] and he did he he blessed us beyond what
[34:13] I could have imagined at that time um by
[34:17] allowing us to have the children in our
[34:21] home but in in our conversations and in
[34:24] our thoughts and in our prayers
[34:27] we Heather and I both felt that there
[34:30] was
[34:31] more that we were had been given
[34:34] promises throughout our our marriage
[34:38] through different ministers at different
[34:40] times and different locations that that
[34:43] God was going to give us a biological
[34:47] child he was going to give us
[34:49] children and
[34:51] um it it became at first it was it was
[34:54] easy to kind of push that aside once you
[34:57] had children in your home that come
[34:59] through the um the Avenue of
[35:02] adoption you kind of maybe didn't dwell
[35:05] on that as much but then different
[35:06] things would would happen and and your
[35:09] mind would go back to that again and
[35:11] you're thinking well why has that not
[35:14] happened yet you you still wanted to
[35:16] know why am I still traveling down a
[35:20] journey of infertility yeah you know
[35:22] when everybody else not everybody but so
[35:25] many around you become so easy to to
[35:29] have a child and why are we struggling
[35:31] with it so
[35:33] much and it wasn't until uh
[35:39] 2019 that we were at a u a church
[35:42] service um our camp meeting our church
[35:45] there in Ruth North Carolina Bible
[35:47] Tabernacle um we we've hosted a
[35:51] missionary camp meeting for many years
[35:53] it's it started the year after I was
[35:56] born so this year will be the 51st wow
[36:00] year that's coming
[36:02] up
[36:03] um
[36:06] during before
[36:08] 2019 there had been many times that
[36:13] different ministers had spoken to me um
[36:18] asking me if I
[36:20] felt that maybe God was calling me to
[36:23] the
[36:24] ministry and each time the they would
[36:27] say that I would give a resounding
[36:31] no and I emphatic tell them no he is not
[36:36] he is he's called me to the music
[36:38] Ministry because music was what I loved
[36:40] and that was what I felt comfortable
[36:43] doing and I Knew by watching the lives
[36:47] of other friends of mine who were
[36:51] ministers I knew that the life of a
[36:54] minister required
[36:57] commitment it required a lot of their
[37:00] time and I was
[37:02] selfish quite honest I was I was selfish
[37:05] with my time and um I was running a
[37:09] business or trying to learn how to run a
[37:12] business um and I just felt like that
[37:16] was not what I wanted to I didn't want
[37:18] to do it um I didn't want
[37:22] to yield over my time um to
[37:28] God and um so that went on multiple
[37:31] times through throughout my life even
[37:34] prior to me um meeting Heather I'd had
[37:38] people ask me that and I had felt
[37:41] inwardly each time that they would that
[37:44] they would ask me that question and I
[37:46] would give that
[37:48] response there I could hear the voice
[37:50] inside of me
[37:51] saying that's wrong you know and I could
[37:55] feel it was it was was like I was I was
[37:57] hurting the spirit within me every time
[38:00] I would say that because it was
[38:03] contradictory to what I knew was correct
[38:05] in me and
[38:08] um so in 2019 at at the missionary camp
[38:13] meeting there was a speaker that that
[38:16] spoke that that
[38:18] night and um after after he spoke he was
[38:22] having he was receiving some Kickback as
[38:25] he was ministering he even mentioned it
[38:27] during the uh the service and he had
[38:30] made a comment that you know if maybe if
[38:32] the Lord can't work out here you know he
[38:35] could work behind the curtain well we
[38:37] were in a um a place called the
[38:40] foundation um and so they have large
[38:44] curtains um off to the sides and after
[38:48] his ministry that
[38:51] evening he had moved off um the
[38:54] platform and
[38:57] different individuals um had come come
[39:00] to him and was um being prayed
[39:04] for and he was ministering to them
[39:07] through prayer and given Direction and
[39:11] given you know some some direct things
[39:14] from the Lord to those couples some were
[39:17] couples and some were individuals that
[39:18] he was speaking
[39:20] with and I was just kind of waiting
[39:23] patiently because it kind of crowded the
[39:25] the exit door I was just tring to hold
[39:28] back I was going to wait till I could
[39:30] get out and go find Heather well I
[39:33] didn't know that she was making her way
[39:36] down a side hallway back to the platform
[39:40] because I'd been back there for a while
[39:42] and and she wanted to to to greet the
[39:44] minister as well and so as he moved out
[39:49] into the hallway and he he saw
[39:54] her his he he saw Heather walking and he
[39:58] said where's your
[39:59] husband well I was behind him he didn't
[40:02] know where that I was back kind of in
[40:04] the shadows area didn't realize I was
[40:06] back there he said where's your husband
[40:09] and I heard him say that and so my
[40:12] immediate assumption was he's going to
[40:15] pray with us as a couple um about our
[40:20] desire to have children um
[40:23] cuz so many people knew yeah you know
[40:26] for years and years and years um have
[40:28] seen um seen us talk about our desire
[40:32] for for children so I I just felt that
[40:35] that's what he was going to do so I got
[40:38] over next to Heather and and he got
[40:41] closer to us and then he called my
[40:44] pastor he looked to to behind him and
[40:46] said you might want to come over here
[40:48] for this I found that a little odd you
[40:51] know I'm like well maybe he just going
[40:53] to bind Faith together and um
[40:57] more people pray and I was that's what I
[41:00] was ready for I was ready to enter in
[41:03] and let them pray that we're going to
[41:05] have children because I've went through
[41:07] that I've heard that prayer so many
[41:09] times throughout the
[41:11] years we didn't look at
[41:14] Heather he looked straight in my eyes
[41:18] and it was as though he's looking
[41:19] straight through me and took his hand
[41:22] and touched my
[41:24] chest and said until you fully surrender
[41:28] to what God has called you to
[41:30] do God cannot fully bless
[41:33] you and it was at that
[41:36] moment that I
[41:39] recognized that it was my
[41:41] fault it was my decisions that I had
[41:46] made that was delaying what God was
[41:49] wanting to
[41:50] do and I realized that I had to yield I
[41:55] had no other
[41:57] way to any other anything else that I
[41:59] could do but fully yield and I I I I I
[42:03] didn't go down to the floor but I was I
[42:06] got so so weak that they caught me and
[42:09] uh because I I recognized immediately I
[42:12] knew what the Lord was telling me and I
[42:15] knew that he was it was coming down to a
[42:19] a decision that I had to either say yes
[42:22] Lord I'm going to yield to what you've
[42:25] called me to do I've been running from
[42:27] it for 17 at that time 17 years I had
[42:31] pushed it aside and I knew that God had
[42:35] called me to the
[42:36] ministry he had showed me so many times
[42:39] that he had but I was resisting it I did
[42:42] not want to yield to it and I I I'm
[42:46] embarrassed to say that you know as as a
[42:49] minister now to sit here and say that
[42:51] that I stood in God's way for so many
[42:55] years he was there the entire time
[42:59] trying his best to pour out his
[43:02] blessings on
[43:03] me and because of my ignorance I'll put
[43:07] it that way um my
[43:11] stubbornness um I would not yield to
[43:16] it and um you know I I I can't go back
[43:20] and change those things I I look at it
[43:24] and and I recognize that that through
[43:27] all of those things God still had an
[43:30] expected end when you look at Jeremiah
[43:33] 29:11 he still had an expected end and
[43:36] he brought me to that expected end even
[43:40] though I moved and and got out of his
[43:43] got got in his way and got out of line
[43:46] of where I really should have been other
[43:49] blessings could have been maybe brought
[43:51] on sooner but then
[43:53] also Jaden and Savannah
[43:57] most likely would have not have been
[43:58] brought into our home or it would would
[44:01] have been done through a different
[44:02] avenue it would not have happened in the
[44:04] the way that it happened if I would have
[44:07] yielded to that 17 years
[44:10] ago um and which would have been even
[44:13] before me meeting Heather um and so in
[44:19] all of that even with with my
[44:21] stubbornness God God looked beyond that
[44:25] and he had a plan that was going to come
[44:28] to fruition and it has and so we you I I
[44:34] I yielded to the to the the call of
[44:36] ministry and um was absolutely scared to
[44:40] death um I had some brothers uh reach
[44:44] out to me um shortly after they heard
[44:48] that I had U that had yielded to the
[44:51] call
[44:53] um when the first one sent sent me a
[44:56] text I was in my truck and got got the
[45:00] text come across my phone asking if I
[45:03] would come and Minister for him and I
[45:05] literally got sick I sat in the truck
[45:09] and and got got sick I felt like my face
[45:12] was just flushed um because
[45:15] it it just it just hit me so hard that
[45:19] it was really really happening and and
[45:22] that you know I had to answer I had to
[45:24] answer that call and and I I could no
[45:27] longer sit on my hands and and refuse to
[45:30] do what God wanted me to do because I
[45:33] knew at that moment if I refuse to do
[45:36] that anymore there's no telling what
[45:39] what suffering that I might have to go
[45:40] through um if I didn't yield especially
[45:44] whenever he came in such a strong way to
[45:46] speak to
[45:47] me so um I I started
[45:52] ministering um late
[45:54] 2019
[45:57] and
[45:58] um Heather and I still you know still
[46:01] going forward then I felt renewed I I my
[46:05] my um I felt renewed with
[46:11] expecting um that we're going to have a
[46:13] child we're going to have a biological
[46:15] child of our
[46:16] own because I I started then I started
[46:19] looking I was like well Lord I'm I'm you
[46:22] know I'm doing what I supposed to do now
[46:24] you can bless me yeah
[46:27] and that's not the way God always works
[46:30] just because you know we can't we can't
[46:32] put him in a box and say okay there's a
[46:35] if I you know I've done this now now
[46:38] you've got to come and and and show me
[46:40] that that you're going to honor it you
[46:42] know we we can't direct him and we can't
[46:45] dictate to him sure what his timing is
[46:48] his promise is still going to be
[46:49] fulfilled but I can't dictate to him
[46:52] when it's going to
[46:54] happen so we uh
[46:57] um we we went on and and looking and
[47:01] anticipating that um any you know any
[47:03] month that we're going to get a a test
[47:06] result it's going to say that that
[47:08] Heather's pregnant and it went on for
[47:11] month after month after month again and
[47:14] you're over over a year again and then
[47:17] that that devil of discouragement starts
[47:20] popping in your head and starts telling
[47:23] you
[47:23] see all that was just you know that was
[47:27] just in your head none of that really
[47:28] mattered and it started trying to play
[47:31] those those things through your mind and
[47:33] you had to push that back every single
[47:36] time and say no that's not correct it's
[47:40] when God when God wants to do it he's
[47:41] going to do it but in my mind in my my
[47:44] natural thinking I'm thinking I'm
[47:46] getting older you know my my wife's
[47:48] getting older and uh I wasn't getting to
[47:51] Abraham's age um but I we we we were we
[47:55] getting uh getting older and
[48:00] um there was a a a thing that started
[48:03] happening
[48:05] um I I started noticing that um I'd lay
[48:09] down at at to to bed in the evening and
[48:13] night after night I would
[48:15] see the number
[48:18] 1111 on my
[48:20] clock it was
[48:22] 1111 it got to the point that I was
[48:25] start taking snapshots of it I'd be
[48:28] sitting at work and happen to look down
[48:31] at my phone and I'd pull my phone out
[48:33] and it'd say 11-11 and I'd screenshot it
[48:37] and I'd send it to Heather I said I
[48:39] don't understand what is going on why
[48:41] why do I keep seeing
[48:44] 1111 all the
[48:46] time and um we went went on and on and
[48:50] it it went on for um a couple of months
[48:55] and she started seeing 11-11 on that it
[48:59] just seemed like different things we
[49:01] were going down the highway um had
[49:03] visited some friends and was coming back
[49:05] and come to an intersection I looked
[49:07] over and there was a sign that said
[49:09] 11-11 um on at the gas station and I
[49:13] don't even know what the sign was about
[49:14] but it had 1111 on it and I kept
[49:18] remarking to her I said there's
[49:20] something I don't I don't know why I
[49:21] keep seeing that but there has to be a
[49:23] reason I keep seeing
[49:24] it
[49:26] and um it was during the time um that uh
[49:30] a lot of covid restrictions was going on
[49:33] that uh we couldn't be in church um
[49:37] having live services so brother Joe um
[49:42] was ministering and we were at home live
[49:45] streaming for some of the
[49:47] services and he
[49:50] started I believe it I think it was one
[49:52] of those services or I might have been
[49:54] in service with him I can't remember
[49:55] remember
[49:57] exactly but he he was ministering and he
[50:00] said let's turn to to uh to Hebrews
[50:05] 111 I remember that Heather wasn't in
[50:07] the in the service that that night for
[50:09] some reason I think she was um visiting
[50:12] her family in Georgia and he said let's
[50:14] turn to Hebrews 11:11 and as soon as he
[50:18] said Hebrews my mind was
[50:21] flooded something's getting ready to be
[50:23] spoken to me yeah because that's all
[50:26] I've seen for the last 2 months is the
[50:28] number 1111 and in Hebrews 11:11 we we
[50:32] see where it says that it was by faith
[50:37] that
[50:38] Sarah received strength to receive
[50:42] seed and because at the end of that
[50:45] scripture it says because she judged him
[50:49] own faithful who promised
[50:52] yeah and it was it was so strong WR that
[50:56] it that it hit me at that moment
[50:58] that we have to judge him faithful we
[51:02] have to accept that he is faithful the
[51:04] one who gives us the promise is faithful
[51:08] to perform the promise and we can't let
[51:11] the things that we see distract us and
[51:14] the things that that that is that we
[51:17] that we see with our own eyes distract
[51:19] us from that but we have to recognize
[51:22] and judge him faithful that's what he
[51:24] that's what Sarah did she justed him
[51:27] faithful she said the one who gave me
[51:28] the promise will keep the promise and we
[51:32] move forward from
[51:35] that and shortly shortly after that
[51:39] received a um uh an individual that came
[51:42] to me and said um have you guys thought
[51:46] about uh trying
[51:48] IVF um again because we had tried IVF uh
[51:53] we had actually done one series of IVF
[51:56] and two series of
[51:59] IUI and all of which were
[52:03] unsuccessful and when the person
[52:05] mentioned that to me I said that's very
[52:08] expensive um it's
[52:11] $20,000 um or better to uh to do an IVF
[52:15] procedure and they said well just know
[52:19] if the two of you chose to um to try
[52:23] that route one more time
[52:25] that the money has been set aside and
[52:28] it's covered
[52:30] 100% And so I was just blown
[52:34] away um I didn't say anything to to
[52:37] Heather about that um I just kept it to
[52:41] myself and um a few days later uh about
[52:46] three or three or four days later um she
[52:49] had gotten a a message from a a friend
[52:53] uh from down in Jamaica
[52:55] sister Francine Reed had sent her a um a
[53:00] message that was about a uh a couple in
[53:05] in Florida who had went through an IVF
[53:10] um procedure and was successful and they
[53:13] had been married for 16 years and there
[53:16] were and it it so matched our situation
[53:20] it got us talking about it and she said
[53:23] look the even the the name name of the
[53:25] hospital that they went to um was the
[53:29] same name of the hospital that we would
[53:31] be going to in our
[53:35] area and
[53:37] um so we after we we talked about it for
[53:40] a few minutes I said well let me share
[53:42] this with you
[53:45] um and I and I went went with went over
[53:48] with her what the person had told me and
[53:51] she just her eyes got big and and U we
[53:54] just said there and and talked about it
[53:56] for a while and um prayed about it and
[53:59] we didn't didn't make a hasty decision
[54:02] but we we decided we would go through
[54:05] that and try that so we we did the um
[54:11] the IVF
[54:13] procedure and um out of don't want to go
[54:17] through all the details details of it
[54:19] because it gets lengthy but um out of it
[54:22] we um we were blessed with uh three
[54:26] healthy
[54:27] embryos um out of the three embryos we
[54:31] were able to use
[54:33] one and um during the uh they call it a
[54:39] Embryo
[54:40] transfer and as it's when they they
[54:43] place the embryo
[54:45] um inside the in inside Heather they
[54:49] they during the procedure the doctor
[54:52] comes in and uh she says says now um
[54:57] you'll know when the
[54:59] implantation uh procedure is
[55:02] complete because you'll see she had a
[55:04] screen up pulled up there for us to
[55:06] watch she said you'll see a burst of
[55:08] light appear on the screen and you'll
[55:11] know that the implantation transfer has
[55:14] been or the transfer of the embryo is
[55:18] complete and when she said you're you're
[55:21] going to see a burst of light show up on
[55:23] that screen I I look at her and I said
[55:26] you do not know what you just said I
[55:29] said because that's exactly what's
[55:31] happening Life Light is being planted
[55:35] and placed and that light is going to
[55:38] grow and that light did grow and that
[55:41] light is Liam and he is he's our
[55:45] firstborn um natural um child biological
[55:52] child and um we were just ecstatic that
[55:57] God had allowed through even through
[56:01] medicine um in medical science to assist
[56:06] and to to something that we had was
[56:09] getting to a place that we really
[56:10] wondered you was it ever going to take
[56:13] place even though we we you want to
[56:15] believe and you you you keep trying to
[56:18] believe with all the faith that you can
[56:20] that that it is going to happen but the
[56:23] longer the delay many times it's it's
[56:26] easy for you to
[56:28] um to start questioning things but we we
[56:32] witnessed it we watched it and and
[56:34] Little Liam was was born and just a
[56:38] bundle of joy and we were so ecstatic
[56:41] and just so thrilled and and you we we
[56:44] have our promise of God that that um is
[56:48] now in in our arms and we can physically
[56:51] hold this
[56:52] miracle and about 9
[56:56] months that after he he was about 9
[56:59] months old and I come home from work one
[57:03] day and um I was outside of the house
[57:07] and it was a Wednesday evening and I was
[57:10] just taking care of a couple things that
[57:11] I needed to do outside before getting
[57:13] ready for
[57:14] church and all of a sudden I hear the
[57:17] door open and Heather
[57:20] screaming coming out of the house and
[57:22] I'm like what has happened well is is
[57:25] Liam okay is you know what's what's
[57:27] happened that's my my first thought is
[57:29] something is wrong and she comes running
[57:31] out of the house and she's carrying a u
[57:34] pregnancy
[57:35] test and she said I'm
[57:39] pregnant and I said say
[57:43] what and and and at first I literally
[57:46] told her I said why I said why are you
[57:49] why are you joking about I said this is
[57:51] not something to joke about I said
[57:52] that's one of the old pregnancy test
[57:54] back whenever you were checking about
[57:57] Liam and she said no I just took this
[58:00] pregnancy test right now and I said
[58:04] seriously and she said yes and uh so
[58:10] we're like didn't know what to think did
[58:13] not know what to think so of course we
[58:16] you know go and go to the doctors and
[58:19] and let them uh do some checks and
[58:22] everything and they're like you most
[58:24] certainly are pregnant and you're going
[58:28] to have we you know later find out we're
[58:30] going to have a little
[58:31] girl and um so now we have we have
[58:36] Mila and um it just it it showed me for
[58:42] for me and this is the way I look at
[58:45] it it it showed
[58:49] me that God not only works through
[58:53] medicine
[58:55] but even when things seem hopeless and
[58:58] you feel like you have you have tried
[59:01] every Avenue that you can
[59:04] do that if we
[59:06] truly trust and we truly believe and
[59:11] truly have faith in what he said that he
[59:15] would do that he will come and perform
[59:18] it um and in a time that we thought
[59:22] there was absolutely medical science
[59:25] had told us there's no way and if you
[59:28] ever since she had we had Leo they said
[59:31] if you ever want to go have another
[59:33] pregnancy you'll have to come back to us
[59:36] and do it this way again and then God
[59:40] stepped him and said you've trusted
[59:43] me you've you've you've yielded you've
[59:47] trusted you've watched what what I've
[59:49] done even through the Avenue of medicine
[59:52] but now let me show you
[59:55] what my fullness is the fullness of his
[59:57] power the true power of God when he can
[1:00:00] come down and take a a wound that was
[1:00:02] unable to to have a child and to Bear a
[1:00:05] child and he says I can make it do that
[1:00:08] I can place seed there and I can let her
[1:00:11] have a child when it's all natural no
[1:00:16] anybody that had any doubts of like Oh
[1:00:18] well man still had to help like God just
[1:00:20] stepped in and said all right let let me
[1:00:22] share you now exactly and we had even
[1:00:25] had um we had had people say that when
[1:00:29] we would we would give testimony about
[1:00:31] Liam and and how he came and and how God
[1:00:34] moved and they said well yeah but you
[1:00:37] still went to the doctors and the
[1:00:38] doctors did this and they did that and
[1:00:40] they did the other and you know so they
[1:00:44] kind of they they kind of wanted to
[1:00:45] lessen the miracle the miracle they is
[1:00:48] still 100% a miracle he is 100% a
[1:00:52] miracle but then God said I just believe
[1:00:55] he he said okay I want to take away any
[1:00:58] doubt yeah I want to take away any
[1:01:01] chance that somebody could take the
[1:01:03] testimony from you and I'm going to give
[1:01:06] you another child and I'm going to give
[1:01:09] you a child in such a way that nobody
[1:01:11] can ever question amen even to the point
[1:01:15] of as she was
[1:01:18] growing they did an ultrasound and told
[1:01:20] us she only has a two vessel umbilical C
[1:01:25] which you're supposed to have a three
[1:01:27] vessel many children are are able to be
[1:01:30] born uh without complication with only a
[1:01:32] two vessel but there are others that if
[1:01:35] they have a two vessel it's indicator
[1:01:37] that um that there may be some other
[1:01:39] things wrong there may be some
[1:01:41] deformities and
[1:01:42] such and so they started telling us that
[1:01:47] which first thing Satan wants to do is
[1:01:49] that yeah yeah I'm I'm going to squelch
[1:01:53] that testimony I'm going to I'm going to
[1:01:55] do something that's damaging to her and
[1:01:59] we we left out of that um appointment
[1:02:02] and went to church I think the either
[1:02:04] that day or the next day went to church
[1:02:07] and presented the need before the the
[1:02:09] congregation and we told them what they
[1:02:11] had told us that she only has two vessel
[1:02:14] cord and it could be an indicator of
[1:02:16] down syndrome or some different
[1:02:18] different
[1:02:20] things and I remember standing there
[1:02:22] before the church and I said I said the
[1:02:24] that I serve that has cre given us this
[1:02:28] creation is able to keep her throughout
[1:02:31] the pregnancy to go to full term even
[1:02:35] with a two vessel cord and she would
[1:02:37] just be she'll be just fine I said but
[1:02:40] he's also able to create another vessel
[1:02:44] in that cord and give her a three vessel
[1:02:47] cord when they say she has a two vessel
[1:02:49] and we have the the prince where they
[1:02:51] did the ultrasound and the prince showed
[1:02:53] two vessel cord so due to her having
[1:02:56] that or they they the two vessel cord
[1:02:59] they said we want you to go to a a
[1:03:01] Target Anatomy scan which was almost two
[1:03:04] weeks later and we want you to go for
[1:03:06] that uh so they can check to see if she
[1:03:09] has indicators for um abnormalities and
[1:03:14] and what they would refer to as
[1:03:17] defects deficiencies and we said well
[1:03:20] we'll we'll go to it and I even I told
[1:03:23] him I said we'll go to it but we're
[1:03:24] going to go to that appointment and
[1:03:26] we're going to let doctors testify
[1:03:29] before we ever got there I said that
[1:03:31] from the from to the church we're going
[1:03:32] to let the doctors testify what God can
[1:03:35] do so we get to the
[1:03:39] appointment and they start doing all of
[1:03:41] the
[1:03:42] scans and I'm listening to the
[1:03:45] sonographer as she's you know checking
[1:03:48] her head checking her hands checking her
[1:03:50] feet check you know all the all the body
[1:03:52] parts she's going through checking
[1:03:53] everything and and and she she said that
[1:03:56] looks good that looks good that looks
[1:03:57] good and then she she's just talking
[1:03:59] along and she says now your chart says
[1:04:01] that the reason why you guys are here
[1:04:04] today is because she has a two vessel
[1:04:07] core and we're said that's that's right
[1:04:10] that's why we had to come she said well
[1:04:13] she doesn't have a two vessel cord she
[1:04:15] has a three vessel cord and she said let
[1:04:18] me show you and she pulled it up on the
[1:04:19] screen and she showed us multiple places
[1:04:21] throughout where she had a three vessel
[1:04:23] cord
[1:04:24] and uh and I saidwell that's that's just
[1:04:26] wonderful I said because that's what we
[1:04:28] said that God was going to be able to do
[1:04:31] and she just kind of looked at us you
[1:04:33] know and then you she didn't really go
[1:04:35] on about it and she said well maybe that
[1:04:37] they maybe they you know they messed up
[1:04:39] I said no they didn't mess up I've got
[1:04:41] pictures where it clearly shows the two
[1:04:44] vessel and now she has a three vessel
[1:04:47] and um so again it was just God's
[1:04:51] confirmation um to us of of his miracul
[1:04:54] power in what he can do when we just
[1:04:58] trust in him um and I know that sounds
[1:05:01] like maybe to something that sounds like
[1:05:02] a a cliche um that all you have to do is
[1:05:06] trust in God well that's literally yeah
[1:05:08] all you have to do for sure is trust in
[1:05:11] him because he he is not going to fail
[1:05:15] his word can never fail absolutely
[1:05:19] Canada that mine can but his can't and
[1:05:23] uh going back just a little bit to when
[1:05:26] uh that brother spoke that over that
[1:05:29] Minister spoke that to you about fully
[1:05:30] surrender and I actually shared with
[1:05:32] this with you at the house before he
[1:05:34] came because I had never gotten a chance
[1:05:36] to but when you first came here and
[1:05:38] shared that and I mean you can ask Dad
[1:05:40] cuz I told him about it when you first
[1:05:42] came here and shared that about you know
[1:05:45] your blessings won't come until you
[1:05:46] fully surrender that's stuck with me I
[1:05:49] mean absolutely insane I I there's
[1:05:53] something that I
[1:05:54] I think of every day of my life now wow
[1:05:57] because it meant so much to me and like
[1:06:00] I told you I may I may not remember
[1:06:02] another word you said that whole weekend
[1:06:03] I'm just being honest sure but that one
[1:06:06] thing I I will live the rest of my life
[1:06:08] and by by that because as soon as I
[1:06:11] heard that it still took me some time to
[1:06:14] fully understand what I needed to do but
[1:06:17] as soon as I started fully surrendering
[1:06:19] and understanding what I needed to do
[1:06:21] and I'm I'm sure I'm not all the way
[1:06:23] there but
[1:06:24] you know I'm getting there but as soon
[1:06:26] as I started doing that everything
[1:06:28] promises started coming back blessings I
[1:06:31] mean this is really one of the reasons
[1:06:33] why this podcast started because the
[1:06:34] Lord laid this in my in my heart the
[1:06:36] Lord for that from heing that and you
[1:06:39] know that is like I said I'm so grateful
[1:06:41] that I was able to hear that and and if
[1:06:44] it if it didn't help anybody else in
[1:06:46] this world it 100% helped me and you
[1:06:48] know I could never be you know more
[1:06:51] grateful for that that's that's that's
[1:06:53] awesome
[1:06:54] um I don't I don't even know what what
[1:06:58] what to say but I I'm I'm I'm thankful
[1:07:01] that um that being me being able to
[1:07:04] share something like that uh from my
[1:07:07] life would be able to um to help
[1:07:10] somebody else yes sir and um and that's
[1:07:13] my whole whole reason for um accepting
[1:07:16] your invitation today is is just to um
[1:07:21] to pray and and hope that um
[1:07:24] something that as said can uh can uplift
[1:07:27] someone else and and and encourage be an
[1:07:30] encouragement to them and um again if
[1:07:33] like if if they don't hear anything else
[1:07:37] that understand that yeah that many
[1:07:40] times we're the ones that's delaying the
[1:07:43] blessings that that God is trying to
[1:07:46] pour out upon us and if we can ever
[1:07:49] truly get to the place that we fully
[1:07:51] yield and fully surrender our Liv life
[1:07:54] to him we would be absolutely amazed for
[1:07:58] sure with the Miracles that God will
[1:08:00] perform and what he wants to do through
[1:08:03] each one of our
[1:08:04] Lives um and quck kind of off to it but
[1:08:09] how did uh I know we talked about this a
[1:08:11] little bit at the house how did you uh
[1:08:13] become acquainted with Dad and the
[1:08:14] ministry here and and stuff like that I
[1:08:17] became acquainted uh with Brother Steve
[1:08:21] um as in my in early ear days as he
[1:08:25] would come through um our church and he
[1:08:27] he ministered for us
[1:08:30] um he I remember him so so much because
[1:08:35] again I love music I love singing and he
[1:08:38] had such a powerful anointing um upon
[1:08:41] his music Ministry when he would come
[1:08:43] through and and sing and our pastor um
[1:08:47] loved to hear him sing and he would have
[1:08:49] him uh he would have him play the piano
[1:08:51] and and sing for us and and um it was
[1:08:55] such a blessing and and that's how I
[1:08:56] became um acquainted with him and knew
[1:09:00] him but we weren't um we weren't like
[1:09:03] buddies or friends per se but I I knew
[1:09:06] of him I knew of his his ministry I can
[1:09:09] um I can even remember one of the uh the
[1:09:12] first messages that I heard him preach
[1:09:16] um and I can't remember how far back
[1:09:17] that is now um that's been a long time
[1:09:19] ago I guess it have been maybe in the
[1:09:21] early 90s or late ' 80s I'm not exactly
[1:09:25] sure but some sometime around there and
[1:09:28] and he he preached a message one more
[1:09:31] night with the frogs and um it was a it
[1:09:34] was a message that stuck with me um but
[1:09:37] I I just I loved his um I loved his the
[1:09:43] spirit that was with him the spirit
[1:09:44] about him and whenever he would
[1:09:47] sing and preach the anointing was there
[1:09:51] and um I I was just I I I loved it I I I
[1:09:56] love I love anointed singing Love
[1:09:58] anointed preaching and uh it really
[1:10:01] blessed my my life and um we really
[1:10:06] became um more of a bond due to a um um
[1:10:14] a vehicle breaking
[1:10:16] down and he C he came to my rescue uh we
[1:10:20] were traveling back from a vacation um
[1:10:24] and was coming through the area and our
[1:10:27] van was having severe
[1:10:31] issues and uh so we ended up having a
[1:10:34] stop in
[1:10:36] opala and they were going to have to
[1:10:38] work on the van we didn't know how long
[1:10:40] it was going to
[1:10:42] take Heather started reaching out trying
[1:10:45] to you know see who was in the area that
[1:10:48] we knew and um she reached out to your
[1:10:51] mom and uh so they said said sure we'll
[1:10:55] we'll come and um you let us know what
[1:10:58] hotel you're at and we'll come pick you
[1:11:00] up they came and picked us up at the
[1:11:02] hotel um took us to get us something to
[1:11:05] to eat and while our van was U being
[1:11:08] worked on for the next day or so um and
[1:11:11] it just really created a created a
[1:11:13] friendship and a bond um what some
[1:11:17] people you know what Satan tries to to
[1:11:19] use sometimes to to bring you down um is
[1:11:23] simp
[1:11:24] uh bringing you to where God wants you
[1:11:26] to be and meet the people that God wants
[1:11:29] you to meet and ever since then uh we
[1:11:32] just had a a a close camaraderie um he I
[1:11:37] expressed to him um that the L that the
[1:11:41] Lord had called me um to the ministry
[1:11:44] and and that I yielded to it and then he
[1:11:47] was so gracious to invite me um several
[1:11:50] times now to come down and and speak and
[1:11:53] be a part um the the meetings that's
[1:11:56] been going on and that we've been able
[1:11:57] to come down a few times uh for other
[1:11:59] meetings that I didn't have to to to
[1:12:02] speak and just it just come and enjoy
[1:12:05] and and participate in the fellowship
[1:12:08] and uh it's been such a joy it just has
[1:12:11] been such a joy amazing happened out
[1:12:12] here it really has oh do you I like to
[1:12:16] ask everybody this and I told you I was
[1:12:19] uh if you could give any advice to the
[1:12:21] young people of this generation
[1:12:23] especially the young people growing up
[1:12:25] in the message of this generation what
[1:12:26] what would it be yield yeah that's
[1:12:29] that's the yeah that's first word that
[1:12:32] comes to my my mind is
[1:12:35] um yield and yield soon um
[1:12:40] surrender to God's calling um as soon as
[1:12:45] as soon as he starts calling don't delay
[1:12:48] yeah um open up to him right then and
[1:12:52] give him everything that you've got and
[1:12:55] you will not regret it that that's the
[1:12:58] best advice that I think I could give is
[1:13:01] is yield and yield quick because it's
[1:13:03] sad especially like nowadays seeing so
[1:13:06] many people you know leaving church and
[1:13:08] stuff like that and I mean it's you know
[1:13:11] before they know it it's going to be too
[1:13:12] late and sure you know that's so sad to
[1:13:14] see and hard to watch hey know as a
[1:13:18] young person you know some of these are
[1:13:19] my friends and it's like and if you just
[1:13:22] only like if you only you could realize
[1:13:24] what's what's about to happen like
[1:13:26] exactly and I don't I don't um I don't
[1:13:30] know where they go to whenever you when
[1:13:33] you when you walk away from God and you
[1:13:36] walk away from truth I don't know where
[1:13:38] they go to but if they could if they
[1:13:40] could ever
[1:13:43] grasp the need for surrendering to him
[1:13:48] um it would change their life yeah
