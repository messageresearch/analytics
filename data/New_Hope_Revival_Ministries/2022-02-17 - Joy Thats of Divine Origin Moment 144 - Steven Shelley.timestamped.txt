[0:00] can't nobody do me like jesus
[0:12] he who
[0:13] has experienced that overwhelming
[0:16] forgiveness of god they love the most
[0:19] they love much
[0:21] nobody has to beg them come on
[0:25] nobody has to beg them
[0:28] to praise the lord there there are there
[0:29] are some of them there some of them are
[0:31] right there there are some of them right
[0:32] there that's not all of them but that's
[0:34] some of them
[0:35] nobody has to beg them
[0:38] because they can say what i was and what
[0:40] i'm not
[0:42] what i am by the grace of god it all had
[0:46] a purpose it all had a season you had to
[0:49] walk through some of that
[0:52] or you'd have been as fickle as a
[0:54] backslider in the in the baptist church
[0:56] you know but they don't even believe in
[0:58] backsliding
[1:00] you you had to have a real
[1:03] real deep place
[1:06] a deep deep pit
[1:08] to reach up out of
[1:10] so you'll never fall in that same kind
[1:12] of pit again
[1:14] the flame may flicker whoa
[1:17] [Music]
[1:18] but it'll never die
[1:20] it'll never go out because something
[1:21] will pull your heart and you'll find
[1:23] your way right back to what you know god
[1:26] has done in your life no church could
[1:28] have done it for you no preacher could
[1:30] have done it for you come on now no
[1:33] denomination could have done it for you
[1:35] this homeland
[1:38] this is the homeland
[1:40] that is what's got you out
[1:43] you may not have even known him but the
[1:45] word was seeking for you the word was
[1:47] searching for you the word was looking
[1:50] for you and he found you yes he did
[1:53] rejoice rejoice somebody
[1:56] [Applause]
[1:58] somebody ought to rejoice
[2:01] [Music]
[2:03] hallelujah
[2:05] hallelujah
[2:08] don't nobody know like i know what he's
[2:11] done for me
[2:13] come on
[2:14] you do it for him
[2:15] [Applause]
[2:17] [Music]
[2:19] [Applause]
[2:20] like they used to see can't nobody do me
[2:23] like jesus
[2:25] [Music]
[2:27] hallelujah
[2:30] [Music]
[2:31] you see people dressed up on a sunday
[2:33] morning
[2:34] that you worship with your whole life
[2:37] and you think it's always been like that
[2:39] with them but i want you to know there
[2:42] are people here this morning that were
[2:44] in the very far throes of sin and jesus
[2:48] not a church
[2:50] jesus found them
[2:54] but the bible didn't say joy is your
[2:56] strength
[2:57] the bible says there's a joy that is of
[2:59] divine origin
[3:02] there's a joy that doesn't come from you
[3:04] it comes from the one who lives
[3:07] within you
[3:09] it's not your emotional
[3:12] you know effort that gives you joy
[3:14] it's surrendering all that is unlike joy
[3:18] it's choosing joy
[3:21] as a strategic position
[3:24] [Music]
[3:26] not basing it on your condition
[3:29] but choosing it
[3:30] as a strategic position
[3:33] joy is not a luxury
[3:36] it's necessary
[3:38] joy of the lord the joy of the lord is a
[3:40] byproduct of obedience
[3:43] you obey and you can have the joy of the
[3:45] lord you obey and you can have the joy
[3:47] of the lord we cannot continue to grieve
[3:50] over the past it is time to continue our
[3:52] journey
[3:54] to do exactly what ezra the priest said
[3:56] go our way
[3:58] and rejoice at the goodness of god
[4:02] [Music]
