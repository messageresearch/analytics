Description:
Above all else, guard your heart, because the consequences of life flow from its depths. Jealousy and anger only grow heavier if left unchecked, and we often end up hurting others who had nothing to do with our pain. Yet Jesus, our High Priest, knows every struggle—both real and imagined—and stands ready to carry it so we can walk in true freedom.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
above everything else guard your heart for it is the source of life's consequences now consequences are the circumstances that happen to us because of decisions that we have made that's what a consequence is everything that happens in your life flows out from your heart that's why the scripture says out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh the mouth talks it's everything you begin to attract the very emotion negative emotion that you hold on to so if you haven't dealt with jealousy it just gets bigger and bigger but what will happen is you will take it out on somebody else that has nothing to do with it and when you're called out you'll say well I I'm just going through something let me give you this good piece of help here everybody everybody is going through something tailor made tailor made by a God who knows exactly what it's going to take for you to run the race that you're called to run and get through that Finish Line when I talk to people about overcoming these kinds of things without a doubt just about at least 99% of them mentioned I did it by my confession I did it by speaking God's word over my life and over the situation I did it by a positive biblical affirmation and an affirmation is an amen if I say uh I'm going to make a positive affirmation I am an overcomer I'm saying Amen to every scripture that says I can God knows right now exactly what you would look like smell like live like talk like drive your car like if you were rid of that stuff and I believe if we ask him he would choose that version a a a version of freedom and deliverance a version where you don't take it out on somebody else when they have nothing to do with the offense that you're carrying a version where you're not doing anything thinking anything talking anything that impedes or paralyzes the kingdom but rather your lifestyle is advancing the kingdom directive of the King of Kings and the Lord of lords the last battle it's the battle of the mind it's fought on the Battlefield of the Mind that's good it's not bad it's good because you own the battlefield woo come on you possess it you've got Authority in it your name is on the deed of this we are taking his mind while slowly losing ours the Apostle Paul didn't want it to be that way he wanted us to be able to lose ours and take Christ's but we understand that as the wickedness of every age compounded that we are now in a greater battle than the one the church in Ephesus fought you own this real estate and you're the only one who can choose to say I have a high priest who is touched by every one of my feelings my legitimate ones and my ignorant ones just call yourself out some of them are real and some of them may not be but I have a counselor a high priest A Healer a savior a deliverer I don't have to drive to his office I don't have to book an appointment I don't have to claim my insurance and I don't have to write him a check all I have to do is surrender my will your counsel your high priest your friend he lives on board come on he sits on the throne of your life if you've given him that place he cares he wants us thinking healthy and whole and he doesn't want us overreacting or under reacting he doesn't want us judging one another's motives he wants us to be free how many of you know it's like a burden lifted if if you ever come to a place that you can let anger go over a situation that you've been holding on to it feels like a ton of bricks has been lifted can you imagine the weight of all of my sin your sin the whole world sin pressed upon him as he died on the cross bearing my sin he that knew no sin carried mine and [Music] yours he knows what it means to be heavy he knows what it means to carry something that didn't belong to him he understands he cares
