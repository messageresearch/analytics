TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I'm just wondering tonight Lord how long it's going to take before my better seat starts producing a better harvest so I'm ready to trust you as a redeemer if you promised in your word that you can redeem time I believe you can also read my sowing and reaping and harvesting cycle and I'm going to ask you Lord to redeem I've got to see some redemption in this because you're a redeemer you're sitting there in such desire to redeem because that's who you are and I have got a truckload of rotten fruit and I can't swallow it all so I'm coming to you as my Saviour and that's my Redeemer Lord helped me to sow better seed help me to examine the seed i daily so but lord will you redeem some of this rotten harvest because I really need to be able to move on for the kingdom of God I really need to be able to see the favor of the Lord in my life I really need to begin to see the favor of the Lord in my relationships I really need to begin to see the favor of the Lord on my job in my community in my church huh I really need to see this thing turned around you
