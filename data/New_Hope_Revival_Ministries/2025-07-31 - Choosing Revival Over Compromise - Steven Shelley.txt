Description:
Our ministry isn't about tearing down; it's about building. Not the kingdoms of men, but the everlasting Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ.

There's a time to dismantle, to clear away what doesn't belong. But right now, we're called to build—building in the Spirit, creating an atmosphere where Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever, can dwell.

Without vision, people cast off restraint, abandoning standards, boundaries, and convictions. True vision aligns us with purpose, integrity, and unity. It's our commission to carry this vision, to build upon a foundation strong enough to endure.

Let us not settle for partial freedom or comfortable bondage, much like the people of Israel during their exile in Babylon, who became accustomed to their limited freedom, settling for less than full liberation. We're not here to live in spiritual confusion or compromise. This is a revival ministry, a house of deliverance, and a center of true freedom. Here, lives are changed, victories are won, and Jesus Christ's Kingdom is built.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
The bride is not about destruction. Our ministry is not about destruction. The bride's ministry is about building. &gt;&gt; We're building something. Not the kingdom of William Brham. &gt;&gt; Not the kingdom of men. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; But the kingdom of our God, &gt;&gt; the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ. There is a time to tear down. There is a time to destroy, but we're not in the destroying time now. We're in the building up hour. &gt;&gt; Sometimes things have to be ripped all the way down to the foundation so that you can check to see that you're building on a foundation that will take you all the way through. &gt;&gt; But our commission is to build. &gt;&gt; We're building in the spirit. We're building an atmosphere where he can come Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. We are called and commissioned to carry a burden and to have a common vision among us. Where there is no vision, singularly vision. Where there is no vision, King James translated the verse to say where there is no vision, the people &gt;&gt; perish. I wished he would have taken a closer look at the word &gt;&gt; because that word doesn't only mean perish. It means before they perish, they cast off restraint. &gt;&gt; No standards, &gt;&gt; no boundaries, &gt;&gt; no convictions. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm going to preach it. &gt;&gt; Just every man does that which is right in his own eyes. &gt;&gt; And every man gets to choose for his own house. And it doesn't matter what they do over at the church. It doesn't matter what they believe at the church. It doesn't matter what they've given their lives to over there. I I get to make the decisions in my home. And so we will live contrary. &gt;&gt; We'll live a different way. &gt;&gt; It sounds to me like a compromise of high level &gt;&gt; because where there is no vision, &gt;&gt; the people perish. and they perish because they've cast off restraint. &gt;&gt; The people of Israel had settled into Persia and they had picked up Babylonian ways. They were comfortable in this land of exile and in this land of confusion because the word Babel means confusion, confusing language, confusing speech. And they had settled in and only little handfuls of people had followed the example of Ezra and had made that journey back. When they were captured out of Jerusalem, there were no airplanes to get them from Jerusalem to Shushan in Persia. They marched in chains, chained one to another, prisoners of exile. They get to uh to Babylon and they are eventually given some freedom, we could say. Uh as long as you serve the kingdom empire, you you won't be exactly slaves. You won't be exactly free. Hear me? You won't be exactly free, but you won't be exactly slaves either. So, you won't just go and come as you will. But a little freedom is better than no freedom. Do you know what that sounds like to me today? The condition of many places. &gt;&gt; May God help it not to be the condition of this place. Amen. &gt;&gt; Got just enough freedom to to make you comfortable &gt;&gt; to cause you to want to stay in confusion, &gt;&gt; but not enough longing. &gt;&gt; Not enough longing in your heart for Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; So, you just live in Persia with your Babylonian ways. Oh, it's nice to hear stories from home. I hear the Jews are there. I hear they hide during the day. I hear they're afraid because they're still occupying forces of of several different dynasties that roam the ruins of Jerusalem. And so the Jews are mostly in and out hiding. But oh, at least at least some of our brothers are in the city and they go on living their life, spending their paycheck, enjoying their freedom, which is really slavery in disguise. &gt;&gt; They've been made twofold children of hell. Just enough freedom to keep them from doing all the things they did in sin, &gt;&gt; but not enough freedom to give them victory over those vices and those uh little pet sins and little foxes and not enough victory to cause them to speak with integrity and truth all the time. &gt;&gt; I wasn't looking for a church. This is to be a place of revival. &gt;&gt; It's to be a revival ministry. It's to be a revival center. It's supposed to be a house of deliverance.
