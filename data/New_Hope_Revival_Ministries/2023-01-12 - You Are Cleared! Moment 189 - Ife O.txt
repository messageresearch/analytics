Description:
When Jesus died, He met all God’s requirements and fulfilled the plan of redemption meticulously.  Every demand of the law was fulfilled, every transaction made legal.  He took every transgression, every sin, every ordinance against us to the cross, and stripped the enemy of all power in our life.  Unless we yield it to him, the enemy of our soul is powerless.  

Jesus took His legal position in the courtroom of God as High Priest and became our Intercessor.  He has called us to be kings and priests unto God.   The duty of priest is to leave behind every inferiority complex and sin, every insecurity and guilt.  

We have received the invitation to come boldly unto the Throne of Grace.  As kings and priests, having left behind our inferiorities and complexes, we have the privilege and responsibility to minister unto the Lord.
