TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and in my mind I am being restored but in God's mind I have been restored because salvation is one thing redemption is another how many of you know that call upon the name of the Lord whosoever calling upon the name of the Lord shall be what saved but there is a work of redemption that is my election it is by God's foreknowledge and it's more than just calling on the name of the Lord being say it's being taken all the way back to God's original perfect thoughts about you boy I can see a lot of imperfection in myself can't you and God choose this when he looks at me he chooses not to see that imperfection he chooses to see what he saw about me in the beginning my that's mercy my that is grace that is boundless love that is love that would tear down every lie and bring down every mountain and shine light in every darkness is that God chooses to look beyond our present condition many times and see us in his perfection because that's what the work of redemption is about to restore us and in my mind I am being restored but in God's mind I have been restored in my mind I'm still fighting the battle in his mind I've won the war [Music]
