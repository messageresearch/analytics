[42:15] [Music]
[42:17] &gt;&gt; You're the one that created
[42:20] &gt;&gt; everything.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; Everything exists for you.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; For your pleasure, for your purpose.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; And we do too. We exist for you.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; And as we ponder how big
[42:39] &gt;&gt; the universe is,
[42:41] &gt;&gt; how big you are,
[42:45] &gt;&gt; but you chose to come into this realm,
[42:48] into this world, because you had a
[42:51] purpose. You had something on your mind.
[42:55] It was people that you forneew,
[42:58] &gt;&gt; that you loved. Amen.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; You came here to redeem those
[43:04] that were a part of you.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; And that you wanted to spend eternity
[43:10] with.
[43:12] I thank you for the price you paid.
[43:17] one love.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; There's nothing more important right now
[43:23] in this life than to love you,
[43:26] &gt;&gt; to honor you, to follow you, to seek
[43:29] you.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; But Father, we were helpless without
[43:34] you.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; And right now, we're helpless without
[43:38] you. But you made a way.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; What an honor, Lord, to carry your life
[43:44] today.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:46] What an honor to be co-airs with Christ.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; You purposed to give us a kingdom.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; And in that kingdom there is unlimited
[43:57] resources. And right now we have healing
[44:01] and wholeness and deliverance. But it's
[44:04] when we focus on you, when we put our
[44:07] all our trust in you and your ability.
[44:10] So right now, every hand and I saw every
[44:13] hand
[44:15] &gt;&gt; raised up
[44:18] &gt;&gt; because we need you.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; We need you. And even before we pray,
[44:24] you know our needs.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Whatever we need the most right now,
[44:28] Father, I ask in the name of the Lord
[44:31] Jesus Christ that would you you would
[44:34] come with your supernatural grace. you
[44:36] would stir our inner man, energize our
[44:39] inner man that we can reach out to faith
[44:42] and for the all the promises that we
[44:45] need right now in our lives. Would you
[44:48] would you heal those that need healing
[44:51] in their physical body?
[44:54] &gt;&gt; It's nothing to you.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; Unlimited power.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; We're singing about resurrection power.
[45:02] Father, let the resurrection life that
[45:05] is in Christ Jesus manifest in these
[45:08] bodies right now in Jesus' name.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; Any mental hurdle, oppression,
[45:16] &gt;&gt; be broken in the authority of Jesus
[45:20] Christ.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; And Father, for this meeting, I just
[45:25] pray you would come among us as we've
[45:28] been praising and pressing through. I
[45:31] can just sense the atmosphere getting
[45:32] better and better and better. Father,
[45:35] let the purposes of God be accomplished
[45:38] in this moment in our life for everyone
[45:42] that made their way right here.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; Would you meet them?
[45:48] Would you speak to them?
[45:50] &gt;&gt; Granted, Lord,
[45:52] &gt;&gt; and we just commit our lives. We commit
[45:55] this heart that you created for you. We
[45:58] commit it to you right now.
[46:00] In Jesus name.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[46:32] among us.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; He'd he'd love us.
[46:38] He loved us when we weren't even
[46:40] lovable.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; And he chose to die for us, give his
[46:45] life for us.
[46:47] Oh, there's a love in my heart. I want
[46:51] to do everything that I can to please
[46:53] him.

[48:05] on both ends of that pew.

[48:10] her a miracle many years ago. And
[48:12] brother Chad gave God gave him a miracle

[48:28] [Applause]

[49:57] Lord. Give with a cheerful heart. And
[50:00] we're just going to worship our way
[50:01] right into the preaching of the word. We
[50:03] believe that God called us here tonight
[50:05] for a reason. He wants to speak
[50:07] something into our lives and we want to
[50:10] be ready to hear what he has to say to
[50:12] us. Let's worship together.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[50:19] [Music]
[50:32] Seasons come and seasons go. But through
[50:37] it all, Lord, still I know you're the
[50:43] Oh, you're the
[50:48] people say what people say. God, I know
[50:53] what's true today. And I know.
[50:58] Oh, and I know
[51:03] I could search the world to see if I
[51:07] could ever find anything to match the
[51:11] love that Jesus has for me.
[51:15] [Music]
[51:18] There's nothing.
[51:21] Oh, there's nothing
[51:25] better than you,

[56:32] Hallelujah.
[56:33] [Music]
[56:36] You know, sometimes we feel like we
[56:38] haven't done a lot of good things in our
[56:42] life. Not nearly enough. But I'll tell
[56:44] you, I did something good one day.
[56:48] I I I did the best thing the day I said
[56:50] yes to him
[56:52] &gt;&gt; when I took off the old robe and put on
[56:55] the new one.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; How many of you know that was the best
[56:57] thing anybody could ever ever ever
[57:01] do?
[57:04] And to keep falling in love with him.
[57:08] It's a it's a it's it's something that
[57:11] continues to happen. It's that there's
[57:13] an ing on the end of it. falling in
[57:16] love. You may be seated tonight. It's
[57:19] wonderful. You look so good. It's so
[57:23] wonderful to see you in the house of the
[57:24] Lord this evening. His presence is here.
[57:28] He has a reason for you being here.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Just like he has a reason for me being
[57:33] here.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; We're not here by happen stance.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; We're here by appointment.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; May God have his wonderful way.
[57:42] One of these sisters from North
[57:43] Carolina, the one with the beautiful
[57:45] gray hair is Sister Penny. And uh her
[57:50] sister-in-law is an old friend of ours
[57:54] here. She has been here many times,
[57:57] Sister Evelyn Fox. And Sister Penny is
[58:00] her sister-in-law. And And is this your
[58:02] first time here, Sister Penny? You were
[58:04] here years ago.
[58:06] Almost a lifetime ago. Long time ago. I
[58:09] was young once.
[58:12] I didn't have gray.
[58:14] We're so happy to have you ladies here
[58:16] that you'd come and make this. Uh there
[58:19] are you both from brother All of you
[58:20] from brother Adams. They're from brother
[58:22] Adam Knight's church. Let's welcome them
[58:25] again.
[58:32] He's here.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Let's see what he'll do for us. Amen.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; God bless you all. I'm just uh under
[58:39] under a little something and it's good.
[58:43] Aren't you glad that he inspires us?
[58:47] &gt;&gt; I loved what brother Gley said about
[58:49] this miracle pew back there. I I it
[58:52] makes me want to tell him to slide over
[58:53] and let me go sit with them. Miracle
[58:56] book ends there on the end. God is so
[58:59] good. Are you going to play You're going
[59:01] to play the piano?
[59:03] I thought you might let somebody else
[59:04] play.
[59:07] Yeah.
[59:11] Go ahead then.
[59:14] No practicing.
[59:18] I've been aware.
[59:19] Let me say this beautiful introduction.
[59:23] Let me say this first and do it again.
[59:25] Just like that.
[59:27] I've been aware. You know, sometimes we
[59:30] we're aware. Sometimes we're not aware.
[59:32] Sometimes we have entertained angels
[59:35] unaware.
[59:37] How many of you feel like in your life
[59:39] there have been times that God sent
[59:40] help? You're not sure if it was human or
[59:42] angel.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; When our boys were in the terrible wreck
[59:47] in the truck and flipped the truck and
[59:49] rolled the truck, there was someone who
[59:51] come and cut the seat belt for one of
[59:53] them to get out. And when they finally
[59:54] got out and we got there pretty quick to
[59:57] thank the person, they were gone. We
[59:59] don't know if they got in the car and
[1:00:00] rode on or if it was otherwise.
[1:00:04] We have sometimes entertained them
[1:00:06] unaware. But isn't it wonderful when we
[1:00:08] get this sense in our heart that they're
[1:00:10] with us?
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Sometimes when brother Brandham was
[1:00:13] praying, he would say, and I've heard
[1:00:15] brother Greley say it too, may the
[1:00:18] angels of the Lord come and take up
[1:00:20] their position around the walls of this
[1:00:23] house tonight. On every pew, position
[1:00:25] themselves here. Uh if our eyes could be
[1:00:29] open this evening, there is another
[1:00:30] realm that's running parallel with the
[1:00:33] one you and I are communicating in right
[1:00:35] now. It's not a million miles away.
[1:00:40] No, no. That dimension is running
[1:00:42] parallel right through this place
[1:00:44] tonight. If our eyes could be opened, if
[1:00:47] our ears could be open to it, we would
[1:00:49] we would see into that realm where there
[1:00:52] is a heavenly host
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; who come to help us, who come to watch
[1:00:57] over us lest we dash our foot against a
[1:01:00] stone.
[1:01:02] The dangerous roads.
[1:01:05] There were a few times on the way to
[1:01:06] church, we left about 10 till 5 and as
[1:01:10] we were getting there at Bleecker, we
[1:01:12] couldn't see. We couldn't see ahead of
[1:01:13] us. The rain was so hard and cars were
[1:01:17] pulled over and the water was wa washing
[1:01:20] so fast across the road. It was washing
[1:01:22] big rocks right out into the road there
[1:01:24] for a little while. And we just began to
[1:01:26] pray. I prayed for all of you that God
[1:01:29] would watch over you and keep you and
[1:01:30] bring you here safely. That you would be
[1:01:32] wise. Lord, I said make them wiser than
[1:01:35] they normally are
[1:01:38] so that they're just not taking any
[1:01:40] risk. Just driving slow even if they're
[1:01:43] late. This was one night you could have
[1:01:45] been late. Nobody would have said a
[1:01:46] word, but he he made a way for you to be
[1:01:49] here. And I've just been in my own
[1:01:51] personal life, I've been aware sometimes
[1:01:54] we see, sometimes we see. But if you
[1:01:58] never were to see an angel, know that
[1:02:02] there we don't worship angels.
[1:02:05] I don't fill my homes with statues and
[1:02:07] paintings of angels like some people do,
[1:02:10] but I like to be aware of the fact that
[1:02:12] we have we have help from another realm,
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; from another dimension.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; And I sensed one even today and I don't
[1:02:21] know why uh he was around, but I'm
[1:02:24] thankful that he was.
[1:02:27] You've got at least one. And some of you
[1:02:31] are so accidentrone and
[1:02:35] uh risktaking
[1:02:37] that you must have a bunch assigned to
[1:02:40] you.
[1:02:42] But isn't he faithful? He knows what we
[1:02:44] need. This is an old song.
[1:02:50] [Music]
[1:02:58] When I'm broken from the battle
[1:03:03] and I've lost a another round,
[1:03:08] Satan whispers to my troubled mind. Why
[1:03:14] don't you lay your armor down?
[1:03:18] Where are those you loved and trusted?
[1:03:24] Look around you. They are gone.
[1:03:29] It would be easy to surrender
[1:03:34] when you're standing all alone. But I
[1:03:39] see a great band of angels camp all
[1:03:45] around me.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, and I see my captain rising up this
[1:03:54] challenge to me.
[1:03:58] Oh, and I know I'm safe from harm when
[1:04:04] I'm touching Jesus.
[1:04:09] Oh, the battle is his, but the victory
[1:04:13] is mine and victory is sweet.
[1:04:17] [Music]
[1:04:20] Then I bow my head in sadness
[1:04:25] while I ponder,
[1:04:28] what will I do?
[1:04:31] I've been in God's army
[1:04:34] for so long. I've tried to be a soldier
[1:04:39] true. That's when I hear a sweet voice
[1:04:44] from heaven saying, "Pilgrim,
[1:04:48] it is I." Lift your head and take you
[1:04:55] courage. Lift your eyes toward the sky
[1:05:00] where I see a great band of angels camp
[1:05:07] all around me.
[1:05:09] Thank God they're here and I see my
[1:05:12] captain rising up
[1:05:16] [Music]
[1:05:18] to me.
[1:05:21] I know I'm safe from harm when I'm
[1:05:27] touching Jesus.
[1:05:31] Oh, the battle is his, but the victory
[1:05:35] is mine and victory is sweet.
[1:05:42] So I bow my head in sadness
[1:05:47] while I ponder
[1:05:50] what to do. Where are my friends gone?
[1:05:53] I've been in God's army
[1:05:56] for so long. I've tried to be a soldier.
[1:06:02] True. That's when I hear a sweet voice
[1:06:07] from heaven saying, "Pilgrim,
[1:06:11] it is I."
[1:06:13] Lift your head and take new courage.
[1:06:18] Lift your eyes toward the sky where I
[1:06:24] see a great band of angels cam all
[1:06:29] around me. You may not see them, but
[1:06:32] they're with you. Oh, I see my
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; captain
[1:06:38] this challenge to me.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; I don't care what the challenge is. I
[1:06:44] know I'm safe from harm when I'm
[1:06:50] touching Jesus.
[1:06:52] [Music]
[1:06:54] Oh, the battle is
[1:06:57] but the victory is mine. Victory is
[1:07:01] sweet. Sing the chorus again. Oh, I see
[1:07:06] a great man of angels kept hold around
[1:07:12] me.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; I see my captain
[1:07:21] challenge to me.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; To me.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; I know I'm safe. from harm when I'm
[1:07:32] touching Jesus.
[1:07:36] Oh, the battle is his, but the victory
[1:07:40] is mine. I know the battle is his, but
[1:07:44] the victory is mine.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; I said the battle is his, but the
[1:07:49] victory is mine. And victory is sweet.
[1:07:59] [Music]
[1:08:03] Hallelujah.
[1:08:06] [Music]
[1:08:07] [Applause]
[1:08:09] Oh,
[1:08:16] thank you.
[1:08:18] Thank you, Captain Jesus.
[1:08:23] Woo!
[1:08:26] Hallelujah.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; He's the Lord of hosts.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; He's the God of angel armies.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; He commands them all.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; You and I, we're not commanding angels.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; We don't have to. Our captain does it on
[1:08:47] our behalf.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; All we have to do is say, "Help, Jesus.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. Lord, we need you.
[1:08:55] I don't even think he has to send out a
[1:08:58] decree to you. Just nods his head and
[1:09:01] there they come.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:04] I'm so thankful tonight we're not in
[1:09:07] this alone.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; He surrounds us.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; He surrounds us.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, God bless you. Are you ready for the
[1:09:17] word tonight? Before we do, would you
[1:09:20] give thanks to God for these amazing
[1:09:22] musicians and their gifts and talents
[1:09:25] are
[1:09:27] huge.
[1:09:30] We're grateful for them.
[1:09:35] They're faithful.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; They come early. They're willing to run
[1:09:41] through something,
[1:09:44] not to perform.
[1:09:46] But if you're going to give the king
[1:09:48] something,
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; you ought to give him the best you can
[1:09:51] come up with.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; I'm a big preacher on praise. I like to
[1:09:58] preach on praise.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; But I'm not so much for that hallelujah
[1:10:04] anyhow praise. The one that says, well,
[1:10:07] you know, praise the Lord anyhow. No,
[1:10:10] no, no. It's exuberant praise. The Bible
[1:10:14] said, "Let the high praises of God be in
[1:10:17] your mouth."
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; A two-edged sword in your hand. How many
[1:10:21] of you know you've got the sword
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; and you've got the word in your mouth
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; and the high praises come out sometime?
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; I like it. I can't sing it or I would,
[1:10:32] but I like that little old chorus. Uh I
[1:10:36] mean, it's it's older than you realize,
[1:10:38] but but it has had a breath of fresh
[1:10:40] air, I guess, the last few years. Uh, I
[1:10:43] got to praise. Got to praise. Got to let
[1:10:45] it out. Got to let it out. I don't know
[1:10:47] how to do it, but have you ever had one
[1:10:50] and you and you were in a place where
[1:10:52] you couldn't let it out?
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; I've had them come on me in a funeral
[1:10:58] before.
[1:11:02] What did you do? I just let it out.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; I knew it wouldn't bother the one we
[1:11:07] were there to honor,
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; right? It bo might have bothered the
[1:11:11] family. But listen, when you've got
[1:11:13] something locked up inside of you, the
[1:11:15] goodness of God
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; that follows you everywhere you go,
[1:11:20] you've got a right to praise him.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; And we who have seen the unveiling of
[1:11:25] Jesus Christ, the apocalypsis, that that
[1:11:28] unveiling of Christ the word. uh when
[1:11:31] you have received anointed Isav to open
[1:11:34] up your eyes and let you see that he's
[1:11:37] not a historical figure. He's a living
[1:11:39] reality moving among us tonight. You
[1:11:43] can't offer God some old dried up
[1:11:46] praise.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; You want to give him everything, don't
[1:11:49] you?
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn in your Bible this evening.
[1:11:52] Uh you don't know how desperately hard I
[1:11:55] tried to convince the Lord
[1:11:58] uh to do something else this evening.
[1:12:03] I I guess I I it's a good thing. I'm
[1:12:06] blessed that I came away without a a
[1:12:08] limp in my hip
[1:12:11] because at times I felt like I was
[1:12:13] wrestling
[1:12:14] because I think it's nice when you
[1:12:17] people come. A lot of you, some of you
[1:12:20] are faithful streamers.
[1:12:23] And when you get to come and be in the
[1:12:24] atmosphere, I I always, it's just nice
[1:12:28] if if I'm speaking to maybe do something
[1:12:31] a little different than what we're
[1:12:32] working on as a congregation at the
[1:12:35] time. But he won again. And I am going
[1:12:38] to take it in a slightly different turn
[1:12:41] this evening, but we're going to start
[1:12:42] at the same place. We are in a series
[1:12:46] that is from Jeremiah 48:1. If you will
[1:12:50] will show that to them. I can't see the
[1:12:53] end of it in sight, but eventually we
[1:12:55] will be done with it. But it has been uh
[1:12:58] it's been something that God has used in
[1:13:00] my life. He first gave me the message
[1:13:03] when I was just a small boy. And I've
[1:13:06] got the scribbled notes on my desk uh to
[1:13:10] prove that he did. But we're taking it a
[1:13:14] little bit further in the last few
[1:13:15] weeks. I want you to look at it with me
[1:13:18] and then we'll give you your seat in
[1:13:20] just a moment. Verse 11 said, "Mo
[1:13:24] hath been at ease from his youth, and he
[1:13:28] hath settled on his leaves, and hath not
[1:13:31] been emptied from vessel to vessel,
[1:13:35] neither hath he gone into captivity.
[1:13:38] Therefore, his taste remained in him and
[1:13:43] his scent, his fragrance
[1:13:47] is not changed.
[1:13:49] Now, if you know anything about Moab,
[1:13:52] the man in the Bible, he was perverse.
[1:13:56] He did terrible things.
[1:13:59] And yet, he was minimally judged.
[1:14:04] his people, his descendants
[1:14:07] lived on the other side of the Jordan
[1:14:09] River where you know the story when
[1:14:12] there was no bread in in Bethlehem,
[1:14:15] Bethlehem, the house of bread, Naomi and
[1:14:20] went across, you remember, and her sons
[1:14:23] and they married Moabitetish women and
[1:14:26] Moab was just sort of off the radar
[1:14:29] and uh they had done some continued to
[1:14:33] do some awful things. They had a
[1:14:35] knowledge to do better. They were
[1:14:37] cousins to the chosen of the Lord.
[1:14:41] And yet, they'd never gone into
[1:14:43] captivity. They'd never really paid for
[1:14:45] their mess. And and therefore, the word
[1:14:48] of the Lord came to Jeremiah the
[1:14:50] prophet, and he began to tell them,
[1:14:52] "You're going to pay. You've got to pay
[1:14:54] for some of this business that you've
[1:14:56] been doing, and now your time is coming.
[1:15:00] And I'm warning you ahead of time. Isn't
[1:15:02] God good to give us warning before
[1:15:04] judgment?
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; He's faithful. I want you to look if you
[1:15:09] will to again to Psalm 66. I'm going to
[1:15:13] read uh three verses there and then just
[1:15:18] a quick word of prayer.
[1:15:21] This is a beautiful
[1:15:24] expression of what God is doing when he
[1:15:27] puts us in tight places.
[1:15:31] For thou, oh God, hast proved us. Have
[1:15:35] you been proven?
[1:15:37] Come on.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Thou hast tried us. Have you been tried?
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; As silver is tried.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Thou broughtest us. I heard that little
[1:15:47] amen from somebody over there. Wasn't
[1:15:49] that good? Praise the Lord for that
[1:15:52] amen.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Thou broughtest us into the net. Thou
[1:15:57] laidest affliction upon our loins. Thou
[1:16:00] hast caused men to ride over our heads.
[1:16:03] We went through fire and water, but thou
[1:16:07] brought us Hallelujah.
[1:16:09] But thou brought us out into a wealthy
[1:16:13] place.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Other translators say, a broad place, a
[1:16:18] place where there's plenty of elbow
[1:16:20] room. Hallelujah. A place where your
[1:16:23] spiritual jurisdiction has been
[1:16:26] expanded. God gives you authority to
[1:16:29] speak into situations that you never had
[1:16:31] any authority in before. Come on.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; And you didn't get that way because you
[1:16:36] were good-looking. You got that way
[1:16:38] because you've been tried like silver is
[1:16:41] tried. Tested like God's children are
[1:16:44] tested.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you're one of his?
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you this evening that
[1:16:50] you are here. Oh, with all these
[1:16:53] beautiful faces here, we are delighted.
[1:16:55] But Lord, if we would come together and
[1:16:57] you wouldn't come with us, what would be
[1:17:00] the use? What would be the reason to
[1:17:02] gather? You're the reason we gather.
[1:17:06] You're the reason why we get up in the
[1:17:08] morning. You're the reason why we
[1:17:12] continue to move and raise our families
[1:17:16] to love you and to serve you. It's all
[1:17:18] about you.
[1:17:20] Sometimes when I am praying and I'm
[1:17:24] saying, "Lord, it's all about you. It's
[1:17:27] all about you." I hear a distant voice
[1:17:30] that echoes back to me from eternity, my
[1:17:34] Lord. And it says, "It's all about my
[1:17:36] bride. It's all about my bride." That's
[1:17:40] what makes this relationship so
[1:17:42] beautiful is we are focused on you and
[1:17:46] you are focused on us and we are coming
[1:17:50] together in a holy union that the world
[1:17:53] will never understand.
[1:17:56] It's only to those who are called for
[1:17:58] only the called see their need for a
[1:18:02] more close relationship with you than
[1:18:06] church annity has to offer. Come today,
[1:18:09] Lord. I want to be poured out of this
[1:18:13] vessel into another vessel, leaving
[1:18:16] behind all of the leaves, all of the
[1:18:18] dregs, all of the reasons why we had to
[1:18:22] go through the things we've been
[1:18:23] through. I surely don't want to carry
[1:18:26] any stubbornness with me, any rebellion
[1:18:29] with me, any bitterness with me, any
[1:18:31] offense with me. So help us tonight.
[1:18:35] Your little bride is turning a corner
[1:18:37] again. And we know that something is
[1:18:41] moving among us for eternal purposes.
[1:18:46] And we have a fear. It's not a fear that
[1:18:49] would uh cause us to hide in a corner.
[1:18:52] It's a reverential fear. We have a
[1:18:55] reverential fear that we would not
[1:18:57] offend you, that we would not get in
[1:19:00] your way, that we would not seek glory
[1:19:03] for ourselves. We say today, may the
[1:19:06] lamb receive the reward for his
[1:19:10] suffering. May the lamb receive the
[1:19:13] reward for his suffering. May the lamb
[1:19:17] receive the reward for his suffering. We
[1:19:21] ask it in the name above every name.
[1:19:23] Bashim Adonai Yeshua Hamashiach. In the
[1:19:27] name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray.
[1:19:29] And the saint said,
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; you may be seated this evening. We are
[1:19:37] often finding ourselves in tight places,
[1:19:43] squeezed places
[1:19:45] because God is doing something,
[1:19:48] expanding something in us, multiplying
[1:19:51] something in us, and we don't want to be
[1:19:54] satisfied with where we are.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:59] Naomi Seigo and her family live just a
[1:20:03] few hours from here in Georgia. And I
[1:20:07] can hear him singing in my mind
[1:20:09] sometime. I want my Lord to be satisfied
[1:20:12] with me.
[1:20:14] How many of you want him to be satisfied
[1:20:16] with every part of your life? What else
[1:20:19] is there to live for?
[1:20:22] If you're living for anything other than
[1:20:24] the kingdom of the Lord to bring honor
[1:20:26] and glory to the lamb that he might
[1:20:29] receive the reward for his suffering,
[1:20:31] then your living is in vain.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; But as the old song said, if I can help
[1:20:36] one somebody,
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; if I can just help one somebody along
[1:20:40] the way, then my living will not be in
[1:20:43] vain.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; How many of you know that's just a
[1:20:45] desire of a Christian?
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; And it's not preaching to them that they
[1:20:50] necessarily need. it's living in front
[1:20:52] of them.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; The the biggest excuse that people give
[1:20:56] for not wanting anything to do with
[1:20:58] church is they say the church is full of
[1:21:00] hypocrites
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; and they're not too far off in a lot of
[1:21:05] cases.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; You can say amen or o me.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; But as I tell them when they tell me
[1:21:10] that, well, the problem is at least the
[1:21:13] hypocrite is in church.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; So that means the hypocrite is closer to
[1:21:18] God than you are. So why don't you at
[1:21:20] least go and see what God will do in
[1:21:23] your life.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Somebody is looking for a sermon lived.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; There's a whole generation out there
[1:21:33] that's looking for a sermon that's
[1:21:35] lived.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; And here we claim to have the highest
[1:21:39] revelation of all the church ages.
[1:21:43] And yet we can't even get along with one
[1:21:46] another.
[1:21:50] Amen. Brother,
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; we we just we're just too carnal, it
[1:21:56] seems.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; I heard a prophet say, "We've gone as
[1:22:00] far with God as we're ever going to go
[1:22:02] until we're willing to pay a greater
[1:22:03] price."
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Everybody says, "Amen." But few people
[1:22:07] get in the line.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; To pay a greater price.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "You mean I've served the
[1:22:13] Lord 40 years and there's more of me he
[1:22:16] wants?" He wants all.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; You've heard about the Native American
[1:22:24] that give his heart to the Lord, haven't
[1:22:25] you? And uh he he he got moved under the
[1:22:30] missionaries preaching and uh he heard
[1:22:33] the missionaries say, "God wants you to
[1:22:34] give everything."
[1:22:36] And and so they they found him one day
[1:22:40] under the brush arbor uh with the around
[1:22:43] the altar. He heard the preacher say,
[1:22:46] "God wants everything." So, he had
[1:22:49] brought his possessions.
[1:22:51] He laid his teepee, his bed roll. He He
[1:22:55] even said, "Lord, I'll go get my horse
[1:22:57] and lead him to the altar if that's what
[1:22:59] you want." And finally, he had no
[1:23:02] satisfaction. He had no peace. And he
[1:23:05] couldn't think of anything else that he
[1:23:07] wanted that he had that he owned that
[1:23:10] God would even want. And in his
[1:23:13] desperation, he crawled up on the altar
[1:23:16] and lay up there on the altar himself.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; And that's when a piece came and a voice
[1:23:22] spoke in his inner being and said, "Now,
[1:23:24] that's what I wanted all the time.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; I didn't need your teepee.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; I didn't need your bed roll. I didn't
[1:23:31] need your pony.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; I was after you.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. The
[1:23:37] bridegroom is after you.
[1:23:42] He has an appointment with you.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Just a minute.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; He has an appointment with us
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; in these last days.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; The way some of them preach, you'd think
[1:23:54] that this little bride is going to
[1:23:56] fizzle out. And then in the night when
[1:23:59] no one's looking, he's going to slip us
[1:24:02] little defeated failures out of here to
[1:24:04] go live in eternity with him.
[1:24:09] He He's embarrassed. They The way they
[1:24:12] preach sometime, I think they they think
[1:24:14] the Lord is embarrassed of us because
[1:24:15] we're not overcoming.
[1:24:18] But that's not the way I see it at all.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; There's going to be a final one final
[1:24:24] shaking, one final quick short
[1:24:28] hallelujah, glory, praise God move.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; And the bride's going out of here. Not
[1:24:35] as a fizzling, defeated,
[1:24:38] pitiful,
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; worthy of sympathy bride,
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; but one who has recognized who he is
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; and who she is because of who he is.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; She's going to stop her gossiping.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; She's going to have to.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; She's going to have to.
[1:24:59] Amen. Amen.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; The old holiness preachers used to say,
[1:25:02] "If you can't get to victory, come up
[1:25:04] here, lay your tongue on the altar."
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; I ain't seen anybody laying their tongue
[1:25:10] on the altar lately. But whatever it
[1:25:12] takes,
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; just lay it right up there and say,
[1:25:16] "God, put a fire on it."
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; I'm talking too much about what I don't
[1:25:22] know anything about.
[1:25:24] Let the fire of God. Isaiah the prophet.
[1:25:27] Uh let the fire of God come and touch my
[1:25:30] lips.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. I had my confidence in Uzziah and
[1:25:36] Uzziah is gone. Now Lord, will you come
[1:25:39] and put an angel with colds of fire? Let
[1:25:42] him touch it to my mouth that I might be
[1:25:45] purified. That I might be sanctified.
[1:25:49] that I might speak life
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; instead of death.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Did you know one word of life into a
[1:25:58] situation where there's only shadows can
[1:26:01] bring such resurrection?
[1:26:03] Such anastasis is the Greek word. When
[1:26:06] we hear the scriptures in the New
[1:26:09] Testament in the epistles about
[1:26:10] resurrection, the word is often there's
[1:26:13] several words for resurrection, but one
[1:26:15] is anastasis. And when you see it, if
[1:26:18] you have a lexicon or you you've got
[1:26:20] some kind of app you click on and it'll
[1:26:22] give you what the root word, if it says
[1:26:24] anything like anastasis, it's talking
[1:26:27] about a resurrection, the resurrection
[1:26:30] life that was in Jesus Christ. And it's
[1:26:33] talking about the reality of that
[1:26:35] resurrection being reproduced
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; in your life.
[1:26:42] Not just when your graveyard dead
[1:26:44] either,
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; but we ought to live. We ought to
[1:26:47] breathe. We ought to move with a
[1:26:49] reproducible resurrection on the inside
[1:26:52] of us.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; There's a revelation that vibrates
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; that has life to it. And it's in the
[1:26:59] bride of Christ in this hour. Oh, the
[1:27:02] denominational systems can hoop and
[1:27:05] holler and carry on. But here's one
[1:27:07] thing they cannot do. They cannot call
[1:27:09] for a rapture.
[1:27:14] It can't call for a rapture.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; But one of these days there's going to
[1:27:18] be a bride who'll move in such you She's
[1:27:21] here.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; She's here. She's just being squeezed.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; She's just She's got some leaves to
[1:27:29] leave behind, some drags that have got
[1:27:31] to be left behind. And we get
[1:27:33] comfortable in our in our wine vessel
[1:27:35] and we don't want to have to go
[1:27:36] somewhere else, be poured into some
[1:27:38] other situation. We always complain when
[1:27:41] it rains it pours. How many of you hear
[1:27:43] that all the time?
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Rains it pours. If it's not one thing,
[1:27:47] it's another. I don't know how I can
[1:27:48] handle anything else. Oh my, I feel so
[1:27:51] for you. You You hear Christian people
[1:27:53] speaking death all the time.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about Norman Vincent
[1:28:01] Peele's form of positive confession. I'm
[1:28:04] talking about the New Testament form of
[1:28:07] positive confession,
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; speaking life into situations that look
[1:28:12] hopeless.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. There is a
[1:28:16] life in you if you're a Holy Ghost fil
[1:28:18] believer.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; There's a life in you that can not only
[1:28:22] raise the physical dead, but it has the
[1:28:24] grace to raise a promise, a dead promise
[1:28:27] in you. something God said to you and
[1:28:30] you've given up on it because it's been
[1:28:32] so long and you're wondering if it's
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; you're wondering if it's ever going to
[1:28:37] come to pass. And God said, "Hold on.
[1:28:41] Don't you dare throw the towel in now.
[1:28:45] Hold on. There's a promise."
[1:28:49] Hallelujah. There's a word of
[1:28:52] deliverance. There's a word of
[1:28:54] resurrection that's heading your way.
[1:28:58] Get it.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Catch it.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; So, he's pouring us from vessel to
[1:29:08] vessel, situation to situation. The
[1:29:12] first vessel, we've covered it well, is
[1:29:14] the vessel of misunderstanding.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; I know you've never been misunderstood.
[1:29:19] But a few of us have lived for at least
[1:29:22] 35, 40 years under the veil of
[1:29:25] misunderstanding.
[1:29:27] Here's what you need to know. It don't
[1:29:29] have to be the truth for somebody to
[1:29:30] tell it about you.
[1:29:36] If you don't act just like everybody
[1:29:37] else, if you don't do church just like
[1:29:40] everybody else does church,
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; sometimes if you sing anything that's
[1:29:47] newer than the 70s,
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; they have something to say about you
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; and you get worked up. I've gotten
[1:29:57] worked up before. We feel the need to
[1:30:00] defend ourselves. And every time we jump
[1:30:03] up to defend ourselves, God says, "Uhuh,
[1:30:05] you're not done yet.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; You haven't been misunderstood enough
[1:30:10] yet."
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; So, some of us have been in this place
[1:30:12] for 35, 40 years. All we've known seems
[1:30:16] like is being misunderstood. Family
[1:30:18] misunderstand you. The job, co-workers
[1:30:21] misunderstand you, boss misunderstand
[1:30:24] you, fa wife, husband, children,
[1:30:27] grandchildren. Come on.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; You're trying to be a sincere Christian.
[1:30:31] They call you a fanatic. They look at
[1:30:33] you like you've lost your mind.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; You're following some dead man or
[1:30:37] something. They've got always something
[1:30:39] to say.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; And it's not easy in the moment. So, we
[1:30:44] rise up to try to defend ourselves. And
[1:30:46] the minute we do, we've just extended
[1:30:49] our our trip around the mountain. We've
[1:30:52] just extended our wilderness of
[1:30:54] misunderstanding
[1:30:55] because we're going to experience that
[1:30:57] kind of of perfection, that kind of
[1:31:01] cleansing, that kind of pressure until
[1:31:05] we come out with a plate. We don't just
[1:31:07] doesn't even matter
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; what people say about us.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; You believe you can fall so in love with
[1:31:15] Jesus
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; that you don't care.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; You don't care what nobody else says.
[1:31:22] You don't care who understands you and
[1:31:24] who doesn't understand you. You just
[1:31:26] know you love him. You got to have him.
[1:31:28] You got to have more of him. You got to
[1:31:31] spend time with him. You got to praise
[1:31:33] him. You got to dance for him. You got
[1:31:36] to shout for him and sing for him and
[1:31:39] live for him. Testify for him
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; because you love him. They'll call you
[1:31:47] religious,
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; fanatic,
[1:31:53] neurotic.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; You're looking like you don't know. Oh,
[1:32:00] yeah. They're saying it about you.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; I'm looking around. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I
[1:32:04] see some here tonight. They're saying it
[1:32:06] about you. You You're neurotic.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; If they don't know where to put you,
[1:32:13] they'll just say you're on the scale.
[1:32:21] They the world misunderstands zeal,
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; passion.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Now, make sure you've got a zeal
[1:32:28] according to knowledge,
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; which is a relational knowledge, not a
[1:32:32] head knowledge.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; You can get a lot of head knowledge and
[1:32:35] be an educated fool.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; And that's not what God's calling us to.
[1:32:40] He's calling us to a kind of knowledge
[1:32:41] that only comes by relationship. It
[1:32:44] comes by experience.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; The Bible talks about Mary, the mother
[1:32:49] of Jesus. And it specifically says in
[1:32:51] the New Testament, she knew
[1:32:54] no man.
[1:32:57] How many of you know that doesn't mean
[1:32:58] that she didn't have any male family
[1:33:00] members.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; It didn't mean that she didn't know any
[1:33:04] men in the community.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; That knowing is a different kind of
[1:33:08] knowing.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; It's not a head knowing.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; It's an intimate knowing.
[1:33:14] It's the kind that only takes place in
[1:33:16] the nuptual chamber.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; It's you. It's you and him.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; And if that if the gender thing gets you
[1:33:24] all messed up, just just don't even
[1:33:26] worry about it. Because if a a man can
[1:33:30] be a part of the bride of Christ, a
[1:33:32] woman can be a son of God.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; Simple.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; In relationship, this isn't about
[1:33:38] gender. In office, in ministry, in
[1:33:41] demonstration, there may be some gender
[1:33:44] things that we should consider, but in
[1:33:46] relationship,
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; there should be no no boundaries
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; for either male or female because
[1:33:54] they're neither in Christ.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; We're souls. We're actually spirits that
[1:34:00] have souls.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; And he loves us
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; and he wants to make something out of
[1:34:05] us.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; So, we got to lose. We got to be
[1:34:07] stripped of our need for applause.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; We've got to let misunderstanding strip
[1:34:13] away our need for applause. Our need for
[1:34:16] approval. Our need for vindication.
[1:34:19] We always are triangulating. Bringing
[1:34:22] somebody else in to agree with us. Isn't
[1:34:24] that right, honey? Isn't that right,
[1:34:26] sweetheart? Isn't that right, son? Isn't
[1:34:28] that right? Calling by name. Needing
[1:34:30] someone to nod their head and say, "Yes,
[1:34:33] that's right."
[1:34:34] How many of you know it's not anybody
[1:34:36] else to vindicate us?
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; What we need is to know we're on the
[1:34:40] word.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; And when we know we're on the word, we
[1:34:44] just stand on the word
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; and let the rest roll by us. You ought
[1:34:49] to amen while you can.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; You don't have to vindicate yourself.
[1:34:54] You don't have to waste God's time
[1:34:56] telling everybody how wonderful you are.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; You don't have to put your five-fold
[1:35:01] ministry title on your card. I'm apostle
[1:35:03] so and so. I'm prophet so and so. I'm
[1:35:06] evangelist so and so. Be a son of God.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Be a Christian.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "What are you?" Well, I'm
[1:35:17] a message believer. But before that, you
[1:35:19] better be a son of God.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; You you you better know who Jesus is.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Because Jesus is the message.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; The message is bigger than tapes and
[1:35:30] books.
[1:35:32] Yes, sir.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; The message is the total entire
[1:35:36] unveiling.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; That's what he said. Cover to cover.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Giver to cover.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; That's what
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; all of it. And he's unveiling himself to
[1:35:48] a sincere people. And it's causing them
[1:35:51] to be misunderstood.
[1:35:54] Social media is causing them to feel
[1:35:57] more sensitive about being
[1:35:58] misunderstood.
[1:36:03] Some of us have such big complexes until
[1:36:06] we read a post on Facebook from somebody
[1:36:08] we hadn't seen in 25 years and we're
[1:36:10] just sure they're posting about us.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; 25 years since they've seen your mug.
[1:36:18] They don't they forgotten you exist.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; It's not likely that they're posting
[1:36:23] about you.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; We're so full of complexes
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; because of social media.
[1:36:30] You don't have to say amen.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; It's scientific fact now. It's brain
[1:36:35] science now.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; We're going to have to come to a place
[1:36:38] where we just stand for Jesus. Let the
[1:36:41] world go by.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; If they love us, praise God. If they
[1:36:45] hate us, praise God.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; This isn't a popularity contest. This is
[1:36:51] a race.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; And it's not starting out in the race
[1:36:55] that's going to give you the prize. It's
[1:36:56] finishing. And this bride must not only
[1:36:59] finish, she must finish well.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; She's got to finish well
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; with the victory because Jesus is the
[1:37:07] victor.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Are you here?
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Good. We're going somewhere, but I don't
[1:37:12] want to go too fast. We're going
[1:37:15] somewhere.
[1:37:17] We don't want to spend all of our time
[1:37:18] defending ourselves.
[1:37:22] We don't want to be disturbed by
[1:37:24] rejection.
[1:37:26] It's going to come.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; Somebody's going to leave you out of
[1:37:29] their party.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Let's see if we can get some help in
[1:37:34] here.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Listen, if they didn't invite you to
[1:37:39] their birthday party, you ought to be
[1:37:41] thankful that you don't have to spend
[1:37:43] 25, 35, $45 on a birthday present.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Go to Longhorn, buy you a steak, tell
[1:37:52] yourself happy birthday.
[1:37:57] When we're young and immature,
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; we think we have to be included in
[1:38:03] everything.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; You're going to get left out.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; And like I said, just spend that money
[1:38:11] down at Longhorn.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Don't you even let it bother you,
[1:38:16] disturb you.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Someone said, "Well, I can't help it. It
[1:38:19] just hurts my feelings a little bit."
[1:38:20] Let me tell you something. There's a
[1:38:22] reason for it. Amen.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; You don't even have to try to figure out
[1:38:26] what it is.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Just say, "Thank God." Keep moving on.
[1:38:30] Keep marching on.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Don't be worried about rejection. If
[1:38:34] you're worried about rejection, you'll
[1:38:36] be like a magnet.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; It'll come flying in your direction.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; You don't need human validation.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; You're not anchored in what people
[1:38:47] think. And so this is a reason why God's
[1:38:50] had us in the vessel of misunderstanding
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; because he wants us to get some of that
[1:38:58] stuff worked out of us
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; in the vessel of misunderstanding. Your
[1:39:02] heart has been misread by somebody.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; But let heaven keep the record.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Let the Holy Ghost keep the record of
[1:39:10] what's going really really happened.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Let obedience be your vindication.
[1:39:15] That's right.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; You don't have to vindicate yourself.
[1:39:18] They may not see your heart, but God
[1:39:20] sees your heart.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; They may forget your faithfulness, but
[1:39:23] God will never forget your faithfulness.
[1:39:26] He will never disregard your obedience
[1:39:28] to him.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; When you get out of this vessel of
[1:39:31] misunderstanding, you'll no longer be
[1:39:33] driven by an overinflated ego, but you
[1:39:37] will recognize that without him, we are
[1:39:40] absolutely
[1:39:41] nothing. Amen.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; Somebody ought to say a bigger amen than
[1:39:45] that.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Circumstances will try to manipulate us
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; into stinking thinking.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Let him pour you.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Let him pour you.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; And when he pours, you leave all that
[1:40:00] old stuff behind.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm left out. I'm I'm left out of
[1:40:04] everything. I'm just left out.
[1:40:08] Now I want to go to Psalm 27 for just a
[1:40:12] moment. Verse 5 and 6. For in the time
[1:40:15] of trouble, he shall hide me.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; This is what you'll have to remember as
[1:40:22] you're leaving misunderstanding behind.
[1:40:24] That in the time of trouble,
[1:40:27] he shall hide me in in his pavilion.
[1:40:30] Listen, Satan wants you to get worked up
[1:40:33] about politics.
[1:40:37] He wants you to ring your hands because
[1:40:39] social security will be no more and
[1:40:42] maybe Medicare will be no more and maybe
[1:40:44] this one thing or that one thing won't
[1:40:46] be no more. Let me tell you something.
[1:40:48] In the time of trouble,
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; he will hide you in his pavilion.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; You can't change what's going on out
[1:40:57] there.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Sure, you can vote your conscience when
[1:41:02] it's time to vote. Absolutely. But if
[1:41:05] you get so worked up in what's happening
[1:41:07] in our nation right now that you're
[1:41:10] afraid that you're going to lose your
[1:41:12] investment, you're going to lose your
[1:41:14] retirement, you're going you're going to
[1:41:15] have to take your retirement like David
[1:41:18] took his retirement. I'm an old man.
[1:41:21] Never seen the righteous forsaken.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Never seen God's seed begging bread. I
[1:41:28] don't know how. I don't know when. But I
[1:41:30] know he will hide me.
[1:41:34] I know I was not appointed under wrath.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; New Testament. I was not appointed under
[1:41:40] wrath. There's going to be a way out of
[1:41:43] here one day.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Not one minute until God's got
[1:41:46] everything out of me that's got to get
[1:41:48] out of me so that I can be what he
[1:41:51] called me to be
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; and go home in a blaze of glory.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; And some of us may not see it. Some of
[1:41:57] us may go by the way of the grave. But
[1:41:59] don't worry, you won't have to lay there
[1:42:00] long.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:02] We're in the last of the last days.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; You can mock it. You can make fun of it.
[1:42:07] People have been doing it since the New
[1:42:09] Testament times.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; The New Testament says they're scoffing
[1:42:12] at the at the at the talk of his coming.
[1:42:15] They're scoffing at it. Scoffers will
[1:42:17] surely come show us the sign of his
[1:42:20] coming. But I want you to know we're
[1:42:21] nearer than we've ever been before.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; The bridegroom is doing something in us.
[1:42:27] He's getting a people ready.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; And he will hide us in the time of
[1:42:31] trouble in his pavilion. Let's say the
[1:42:34] word pavilion.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; In the secret of his, let's say that
[1:42:38] word together, tabernacle.
[1:42:40] He shall hide me. He shall set me up
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; on.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, you you think we can
[1:42:51] claim that promise? Is it in the book?
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Is it in the book? Somebody said,
[1:42:56] "What's the context?" Well, we know the
[1:42:58] context. We can preach the context. We
[1:43:00] can teach the context. But the reality
[1:43:03] is every promise in the book,
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; I have the right to attach my faith to
[1:43:10] it
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; and make it my own.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; So, I'm doing that tonight. In the time
[1:43:15] of trouble, my God shall hide me in his
[1:43:18] pavilion, in the secret of his
[1:43:20] tabernacle. He will hide me. He shall
[1:43:23] set me up.
[1:43:26] upon a rock.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Those who misunderstood,
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; they'll have to look up on the rock to
[1:43:36] see where I am.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; Some of those who have tried so hard to
[1:43:41] dissuade you and discourage you and
[1:43:44] deflate you will have to look up and see
[1:43:46] you on the rock.
[1:43:48] Because when the wind is blowing and
[1:43:51] life is howling and the earth is shaking
[1:43:53] beneath our feet, God's going to have a
[1:43:56] people on the rock,
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; stronger than the rock of Gibralar.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; The rock of ages. Somebody say
[1:44:05] hallelujah.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; And now mine head, listen, it goes on.
[1:44:09] And now mine head be lifted up. And now
[1:44:13] shall mine head be lifted up above mine
[1:44:16] enemies, round about me. Therefore will
[1:44:18] I offer in his
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; tabernacle.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; You ought to help me
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; sacrif
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; when I get in that pavilion. I'm not
[1:44:34] going to fold my hands and sit like a
[1:44:37] little church mouse.
[1:44:40] No, I'm going to praise him with
[1:44:42] sacrifices of joy. I'm going to sing on
[1:44:45] the rock
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; from the rock. I will sing praises unto
[1:44:50] the Lord.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; Now, in a minute, I'm going to have to
[1:44:55] say some things without explaining them.
[1:44:58] It's going to be hard for me to do that.
[1:45:01] It's going to be hard for you for me to
[1:45:04] do that. When I get to that place, I'll
[1:45:07] tell you that I'm there. And I want you
[1:45:08] to listen. And this was the wrestling
[1:45:10] match that I ended up having to have
[1:45:14] because it seemed as though it just
[1:45:17] didn't quite fit where we are in the
[1:45:20] moment in the series. But it was what
[1:45:22] the Lord gave me. And he gave me
[1:45:25] instructions of how to ground it. And I
[1:45:28] can't move from that. even though it may
[1:45:32] just simply be declaring it into the
[1:45:35] atmosphere.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Have you ever learned that lesson?
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; You're always looking for who who's
[1:45:43] going to get this and who's going to
[1:45:45] receive this? Who's going to understand
[1:45:47] that? You know, we're looking in the
[1:45:48] crowd. All of us, even public speakers,
[1:45:50] we're trying to find somebody that seems
[1:45:52] to be relating to what we're saying. But
[1:45:54] the reality is we're not just preaching
[1:45:56] to those in this room. when we're under
[1:45:59] the inspiration. Uh uh all of you who
[1:46:02] find yourself singing under the
[1:46:04] inspiration or preaching under the
[1:46:06] inspiration, this bride has an authority
[1:46:09] that we don't yet understand.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; And the word of God declared into the
[1:46:14] atmosphere of your home
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; and change it in a moment's notice.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; Not only change what's going on in your
[1:46:24] home, it can do some changing in the
[1:46:25] block. That's right.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; The word of God has power and authority.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; If you believe that, say amen.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; So, we have to be faithful in this. Now,
[1:46:36] I know some of you are offended that
[1:46:38] anybody else would dare to translate the
[1:46:40] holy scripture other than King James,
[1:46:43] those that he uh hired to do the job.
[1:46:47] But there are some times that we can
[1:46:50] gain a little deeper understanding by
[1:46:53] looking at the original word itself. And
[1:46:56] you don't have to be a scholar to do
[1:46:58] that anymore
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; because there are tools available for
[1:47:01] you if you love to study the word.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; Paul told Timothy, "Study to show
[1:47:06] thyself approved unto God a workman that
[1:47:08] needeth not to be ashamed, rightly
[1:47:10] dividing the word of truth." The Bible
[1:47:12] speaks about the Bereans, doesn't it?
[1:47:15] those who heard the good promises of God
[1:47:17] under the new covenant, but they
[1:47:19] searched the scriptures constantly to
[1:47:21] see if these things be so.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; They understood that if God's going to
[1:47:25] do something in our day, it has to have
[1:47:27] a foundation.
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; Behind us somewhere.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Because when God says, "I'm going to do
[1:47:35] a new thing," he means scripturally it's
[1:47:38] a new season.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; It doesn't always mean I'm going to do
[1:47:42] something that I've never done before.
[1:47:43] Sometimes it means that
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; it did concerning a virgin
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; who was going to conceive a child. I'm
[1:47:51] going to do something I've never done in
[1:47:52] the earth before. He did.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; But a lot of the times it's just simply
[1:47:57] God announcing that you're going to go
[1:47:59] through a new season in your life where
[1:48:01] you understand things you didn't
[1:48:03] understand before. Where you operate in
[1:48:06] things you never operated in before.
[1:48:08] Where you let God use you in ways you
[1:48:10] didn't let him use you before.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. You understand that?
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Listen, this isn't just for a handful of
[1:48:16] preachers.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; This thing is a body ministry.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; God wants every one of us on duty.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; With more than words,
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; with life. Do you believe that?
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; And now my shall mine head be lifted up
[1:48:31] above mine enemies, round about me.
[1:48:33] Therefore will I offer in his tabernacle
[1:48:36] sacrifices of joy. I will sing. Yay. I
[1:48:39] will sing praises unto the Lord. The
[1:48:42] Amplified says it this way. For in the
[1:48:44] day of trouble, I believe you have it,
[1:48:47] he will hide me in his shelter
[1:48:52] in the secret place of his tent.
[1:49:01] Will he hide me? He will set me high.
[1:49:09] upon a rock. When is God going to do
[1:49:11] this? In the day of trouble.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; You believe we're living in the day of
[1:49:15] trouble.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; You believe God's people are facing
[1:49:18] battles like they've never I'm telling
[1:49:20] you, sickness like I've never seen so
[1:49:22] much sickness in all my life.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; That's what the people of God are
[1:49:25] experiencing in this hour. And somebody
[1:49:28] said, "I don't think it's it's
[1:49:29] abnormal." Yes, I think it's abnormal.
[1:49:32] I think it's multiplied. I think we're
[1:49:35] seeing it in ways we have never seen it
[1:49:37] before.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; We know some people in this room know
[1:49:42] what it is to experience a place in God
[1:49:45] where sickness stays at bay.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; There is a divine health.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; The enemy hates it.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; And we don't walk in it because we don't
[1:49:54] talk it.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; Here it is.
[1:50:02] now. But in the day of trouble, he's got
[1:50:04] a place for me.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; There's some other translations. I'm not
[1:50:09] giving you the names. I'm just reading
[1:50:11] to you the slight variation. Another one
[1:50:15] said, "He hideth me in a secret place of
[1:50:19] his tent."
[1:50:24] The complete Jewish Bible.
[1:50:26] I have a little friendship that goes
[1:50:29] along with that one because I knew Dr.
[1:50:32] David Stern
[1:50:34] and his wife Martha who lived in
[1:50:36] Jerusalem.
[1:50:38] He very carefully very very carefully
[1:50:41] put these things together from the
[1:50:44] original language
[1:50:47] and he said for he will conceal me
[1:50:52] in his shelter on the day of trouble.
[1:50:56] Listen to this phrase. He will hide me
[1:51:00] in the folds
[1:51:03] of his tent.
[1:51:07] He will set me high
[1:51:11] on a rock.
[1:51:14] Another translator said, "He hides me
[1:51:16] away under his roof."
[1:51:20] King James said, "Pavilion
[1:51:23] on the day of evil.
[1:51:26] One translator said, "He will raise me
[1:51:28] beyond reach
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; of distress.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; There is a hiding place.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; It's the rock of ages.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; It's the living word."
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; One translator said, "He sets me high on
[1:51:46] a mountaintop
[1:51:48] so that I can look down and see the
[1:51:50] distress of nations. But I have a song
[1:51:54] to sing because he has made a way for
[1:51:57] me.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; Put up the word pavilion. Will you do
[1:52:00] that just a moment? Uh, some of you are
[1:52:02] going to have to see if you can get this
[1:52:05] reading between the lines just a little
[1:52:07] bit this evening. This is a Hebrew word.
[1:52:10] My mouth is dry because I'm nervous. Uh,
[1:52:14] but I'll just take a little water if you
[1:52:16] don't mind.
[1:52:20] This word that is translated in English
[1:52:22] pavilion is Hebrew 55:20
[1:52:26] and the word is suk. It's a masculine
[1:52:29] noun meaning a cover, a covert, a hiding
[1:52:33] place, a tent, a booth, a hut, a refuge,
[1:52:40] a thicket,
[1:52:42] a leafy canopy,
[1:52:45] an entwined boughs
[1:52:48] of trees.
[1:52:51] Sometimes the poets talk about
[1:52:55] a canopy of leaves
[1:52:59] intertwining boughs of trees that become
[1:53:04] Wesley John Wesley makes a statement
[1:53:07] about the intertwining of the branches
[1:53:09] of the trees creating a sanctuary
[1:53:13] in God's creation for his people.
[1:53:17] not satisfied in the hustle and bustle,
[1:53:21] but finding their peace in in nature, in
[1:53:24] creation,
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; just getting underneath what looks like
[1:53:28] an avenue of trees.
[1:53:30] This is one of the words, one of the
[1:53:34] meanings of the word pavilion. It can be
[1:53:38] used to describe the shelter
[1:53:41] of the large leaves of the fig tree.
[1:53:46] And we were singing about a lion inside
[1:53:48] of our lungs. He has a name.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; He has a name.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; You've got a lion inside of you.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; He has a name.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; He is the lion of the tribe of Yehuda,
[1:54:07] Judah.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; This time I will praise the Lord. If the
[1:54:13] lion of the tribe of Judah, his life is
[1:54:17] in you. You're going to be a praiser.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; You just can't help but worship him.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; So, this is a word pavilion is also at
[1:54:29] its very root. It can mean the
[1:54:31] protection of the den or the lair of the
[1:54:34] lion.
[1:54:36] Oh, hallelujah. Hide me in the in the
[1:54:40] cave of the lion. In the lair of the
[1:54:42] lion, in the den of the lion, let me be
[1:54:45] hidden underneath a canopy of trees. Let
[1:54:48] me find my tabernacle, my my shade.
[1:54:52] Didn't he say that on Zion, he would be
[1:54:55] the pavilion? He would be uh the
[1:54:57] protection from the heat of the sun,
[1:55:00] from the troubles of this life. It's not
[1:55:03] that you and I won't no trouble. It's
[1:55:05] that we will be hidden in that pavilion,
[1:55:07] in that tabernacle, underneath the folds
[1:55:10] of that tent, so that what's happening
[1:55:13] around us will not send us into a panic.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; You won't have to run out of your pills
[1:55:21] when you find a rest.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; It won't matter how the wind blows or
[1:55:26] the devil howls, you'll know I've got a
[1:55:29] hiding place. I've got a resting place.
[1:55:32] It doesn't mean you won't face some
[1:55:34] trials and troubles. You may get sick
[1:55:36] like somebody down the street gets sick,
[1:55:39] but you won't be hopeless
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; because you'll be hidden. I am hidden.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; Somebody ought to just go ahead and
[1:55:46] prophesy it. I am hidden. I am hidden in
[1:55:49] the pavilion of the Lord, in the refuge
[1:55:52] of the Lord, in the tabernacle of the
[1:55:54] Lord, beneath the folds of the tent.
[1:56:01] I'm behind the veil. Read between the
[1:56:04] lines, church. Will you do it?
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; For for he hides me away under his roof.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; He goes on to say, uh, this this uh is a
[1:56:13] place, it describes a place where a
[1:56:16] person can be undetected.
[1:56:18] [Laughter]
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, wouldn't you long to be off the
[1:56:22] devil's radar for just 30 minutes?
[1:56:26] Did you know you're known in two realms,
[1:56:28] two dimensions?
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; Did you know heaven knows you by name?
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; Did you know hell knows you by name?
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; You're known in both worlds.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; You're known in both dimensions. And yet
[1:56:42] the promise of God's word is, I want to
[1:56:44] hide my people in a place where they are
[1:56:48] undetected
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; by the one who has come to destroy.
[1:56:54] Now, what have you got to do to get in
[1:56:55] that place? You've got to go through the
[1:56:57] vessel
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; of misunderstanding.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; You've got to drink the dregs
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; of rejection.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; I can't help it if you sleep.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; I got to preach anyway.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; You're going to go through that place of
[1:57:17] being scrutinized.
[1:57:19] everything you do criticized,
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; misunderstood.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I don't like it." I
[1:57:26] don't know anybody that does like it.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; But if on the other side of that I can
[1:57:30] hide in the folds of his tent, if I can
[1:57:33] find my shelter in his tabernacle.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; If he'll give me a pavilion where I am
[1:57:38] undetected from the enemy.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; I'm just reading the book.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; I'm just reading the book. Describes a
[1:57:46] place where a person can be undetected.
[1:57:48] It refers to the protective shielding,
[1:57:50] the hiding place of God's tent.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; I didn't write this. It' come right out
[1:57:55] of the lexicon. The tabernacle, the
[1:57:58] presence.
[1:58:01] This presence is not a feeling.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; It's talking about a heavy glory.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; It's cavode.
[1:58:11] Cabod.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; It's a heavy glory. It's what the
[1:58:15] old-timers used to call
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; shakina.
[1:58:18] She
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; it's a heavyw weighted glory of God. And
[1:58:24] when that heavy glory comes down, you
[1:58:26] may not be able to scream.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; You may not be able to dance.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; You may just only be able to open your
[1:58:33] mouth and say, "Oh,
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; I stand in awe
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; of the beauty of my God.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; Is he beautiful?"
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; Let me ask you a question. Is Jesus
[1:58:48] beautiful?
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; Is the Messiah beautiful?
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; Is he beautiful to look on now?
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; There was a time he wasn't beautiful to
[1:58:55] look on. No one desired to see him.
[1:58:58] Isaiah prophesied no comeliness was
[1:59:00] found in him. He was misfigured.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; He was misshapen by in by sin, by
[1:59:07] iniquity so that no one desired to look
[1:59:09] on him. And the reality is his little
[1:59:12] bride that's transitioning in this hour
[1:59:14] from bride to wife. All we want to do is
[1:59:17] look at him
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; because to us he's beautiful.
[1:59:21] [Music]
[1:59:23] [Applause]
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; Here is his beauty.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; It's unveiled. It's revealed. He is
[1:59:31] standing now out in front of the
[1:59:33] lattice.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; He's near enough to smell his presence.
[1:59:41] Somebody said, "Well, didn't brother
[1:59:42] Brandham say something about those
[1:59:44] people who are always claiming to
[1:59:45] smell." I'm not talking about that. I'm
[1:59:48] talking about what the Song of Solomon
[1:59:50] says. The Song of Songs.
[1:59:54] Who is this
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; that I see coming up out of the
[2:00:01] wilderness?
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; What's the rest?
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; Leaning. leaning. Come on, lean.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; Leaning on her beloved.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; It goes on to tell us she smells
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; like he smells
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; because she's been leaning on him.
[2:00:27] You lean on him, brother sister. Lean on
[2:00:30] him, brother sister. And you'll come out
[2:00:32] smelling like him.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; You really going to be that quiet?
[2:00:40] You want me to tell you what you smell
[2:00:42] like?
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; You want somebody to tell you what you
[2:00:48] smell like? I'm not talk Listen, folks.
[2:00:51] I'm not talking about Bo.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about smelling like Jesus.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; Because you've been with him
[2:01:01] &gt;&gt; because you know him.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; Because you've been in the tent.
[2:01:11] under the pavilion,
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; under the tabernacle.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, we like to call our churches around
[2:01:18] this movement. We like to call our
[2:01:19] churches the tabernacle of this and the
[2:01:21] tabernacle of that and the tabernacle of
[2:01:24] the other. Let's make sure that that
[2:01:26] doesn't become names of blasphemy
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; like some of the rest of the names that
[2:01:33] people hang on their church door. If
[2:01:36] you're going to advertise that you
[2:01:37] you're a part of the Word of Deliverance
[2:01:39] tabernacle, there ought to be a word of
[2:01:41] deliverance moving somewhere under that
[2:01:44] pavilion.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; We ought to have to bring forth the
[2:01:50] tokens.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; Praise his name. I'm trying to stay
[2:02:02] calm.
[2:02:05] and keep my whistle wet at the same
[2:02:07] time.
[2:02:10] It indicates the place. Let's put that
[2:02:12] back up. It indicates the place
[2:02:17] where God dwells.
[2:02:22] That used to be the Mishan,
[2:02:25] the tabernacle in the wilderness,
[2:02:28] the tabernacle of Moses.
[2:02:32] Then it became the tabernacle of David.
[2:02:38] Between those tabernacles, it became a
[2:02:41] temple.
[2:02:44] Kept getting destroyed.
[2:02:46] God kept sending somebody to raise it up
[2:02:49] again.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; Every bit of it a type. Every bit of it
[2:02:54] a shadow. every bit of it. An arrow
[2:02:57] pointing to another house,
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; to another tabernacle, to another tent,
[2:03:04] to another veil.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; Are you reading between the line?
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; What house will you build me?
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; He's not looking for a a a badger skin
[2:03:17] tent anymore. He's not looking for a
[2:03:20] sanctuary of the cedars of Lebanon
[2:03:23] anymore.
[2:03:25] He's looking for a temple, a tabernacle,
[2:03:28] a shelter of flesh.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; He's looking for a body.
[2:03:33] [Music]
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; Acts, read it.
[2:03:41] Read Stephen's sermon.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; Read what he was preaching before they
[2:03:47] stoned him to death.
[2:03:49] He was telling them God was pleased to
[2:03:51] dwell in this and pleased to dwell in
[2:03:53] that and pleased to dwell in the other.
[2:03:55] And then he came in a body of flesh and
[2:03:59] you crucified him.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; And if he shows up in flesh again,
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; they'll do the same to him
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; to them.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "What do you mean if God
[2:04:17] shows up in flesh again?" Well, that's
[2:04:19] what he was doing on the day of
[2:04:20] Pentecost.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; He was pouring a little of who he was,
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; a little of his deity, a little of his
[2:04:28] authority, a little of his power.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; You shall receive power.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; Not under a false baptism.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; Not under a false baptism of titles.
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "I've given you a title
[2:04:43] where you might come and be saved."
[2:04:46] He said, "I've given you a name
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; that is above every name
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; that at the name of Jesus."
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; It's Acts 2:38, isn't it?
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; Baptize in the name of Jesus Christ for
[2:05:03] the remission of your sins.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; But the church couldn't live with that.
[2:05:12] Too many pagans coming into that Roman
[2:05:14] church and they had to put God in pieces
[2:05:18] and give him titles. I wouldn't put my
[2:05:22] hope in a title.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't put my hope in a president.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't put my hope in a mayor.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; Anybody listening? Get off your phones.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; You didn't come here to be on the phone.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; You came here to hear something from
[2:05:38] God. You got ears to hear. You'll be
[2:05:39] able to do that. Stay off the phone.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; It's making us idiots.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; It's rewiring our brains.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; Just go tell a doctor. He'll give you a
[2:05:54] pill. He'll fix you.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; Anybody that goes in and says, "I don't
[2:06:00] have any attention span." They put a
[2:06:02] slap a diagnosis on them and send them
[2:06:04] out the door.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; It's nothing in the world. But we have
[2:06:08] programmed our brain to scroll.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; If it don't interest me, I'll just keep
[2:06:16] scrolling.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; And some of us come to church, we got
[2:06:19] our thumb, and we're just ready. If that
[2:06:21] don't interest me, I'll just scroll up.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; I'm not mad.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; I'm actually happy. Praise God.
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; I've been in his tabernacle.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; But that's where we are. And that little
[2:06:34] bride's not going to be able to be that
[2:06:35] way and make it all the way through. No,
[2:06:38] it indicates a place where God dwells.
[2:06:40] Put it back one more time. Ancients
[2:06:43] have referred to it as
[2:06:47] King James said pavilion. I'm getting
[2:06:49] all that meaning out of the one word
[2:06:50] that was translated pavilion. The
[2:06:52] ancients have referred to it as the
[2:06:54] tent.
[2:06:59] That is that is uh Melik Haham.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; King of the whole universe.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; It's Melik Hamelik.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; King of the kings.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; Lord of the lords.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; And he's got a place to hide you.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; Is he your hiding place?
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; I want you to look at Psalm 76 for just
[2:07:26] a minute. The reason for the
[2:07:29] misunderstanding, and I'll close in a
[2:07:30] little while, the reason for the
[2:07:33] misunderstanding
[2:07:35] is to get you ready for the tabernacle.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; It's to get you ready for the tent.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; It's to get you ready for the pavilion.
[2:07:47] is to get you ready for the hiding place
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; where he can set you up on a rock and
[2:07:52] let you sing the high songs of Zion
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; no matter what's going on around you.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; Look, I saw a taste of that when I was a
[2:08:00] child.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; I did.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; I saw a people that didn't have the
[2:08:05] whole word, but they had enough of God.
[2:08:10] They worked so hard they worked their
[2:08:12] fingers to the bone in the cotton mills,
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; in the hosery mills, in the denim mills
[2:08:19] of this area. This was a mill not just
[2:08:22] valley, not just Lraange Columbus.
[2:08:27] We had we we were making the denim too
[2:08:30] and and the and the
[2:08:33] sheeting and the bedding and
[2:08:38] long before there were automatic
[2:08:40] automatic computerized looms
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; when they still sent an oldfashioned
[2:08:45] shuttle
[2:08:49] where those shuttles would fly out of
[2:08:51] those looms sometime, knock somebody
[2:08:53] upside the head and have to send them to
[2:08:55] the
[2:08:56] cuz they fell cold on the ground.
[2:08:59] Dangerous work. People would sometimes
[2:09:01] get caught up in those things. Serious
[2:09:04] times, poor times. I went to church with
[2:09:08] people on Tuesday night that came in
[2:09:11] smelling like the cotton meal.
[2:09:15] I went to church with sisters who came
[2:09:17] to church and in their long hair was was
[2:09:20] fuzzies of cotton
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; that had flown through that mill and
[2:09:24] they didn't have time to they could
[2:09:26] either go home and cook for their
[2:09:28] families and come to church or they
[2:09:30] could go home and wash their hair and
[2:09:32] clean and put on clean clothes and be
[2:09:34] ready. They couldn't do both. So they
[2:09:36] had a duty to work all day and then go
[2:09:39] home and and cook a meal and provide for
[2:09:42] their husbands and children and then
[2:09:44] bring the ones that would come with them
[2:09:46] to the house of God. And they would come
[2:09:48] in the door so physically tired that
[2:09:50] they could hardly get out of the car.
[2:09:52] But the presence of God would meet them.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; These people didn't seem to have a care
[2:10:00] in the world. They gathered around the
[2:10:03] old hightop piano and sung the songs of
[2:10:06] Zion until they shouted their eyelasses
[2:10:09] off and their bobby pins off.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; They looked like they were in a trance
[2:10:18] at times. Their eyes would glaze over
[2:10:20] like glass, not because they were in
[2:10:23] some kind of ecstatic existence, but
[2:10:26] because they had got their vision fixed.
[2:10:29] They were looking beyond their life.
[2:10:32] They were looking beyond their
[2:10:33] heartache.
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; They weren't seeing the sorrow.
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; They weren't seeing the cotton meal.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; They were seeing eternity.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, Sister Cotney was one of them.
[2:10:52] Brother Shaw,
[2:10:54] she worked until the day she died.
[2:10:58] never missed a shout, never missed a
[2:11:01] service, never missed an opportunity to
[2:11:03] give. And she didn't have the word we
[2:11:05] have today,
[2:11:07] but what she had, she believed it with
[2:11:08] every fiber of her being. And God
[2:11:10] somehow was giving her a little taste, a
[2:11:13] little glimpse of of the power of an age
[2:11:16] to come. She got under that pavilion and
[2:11:19] no matter what was going on, she could
[2:11:21] have she could have told you a sobb
[2:11:23] story that would have made you cry and
[2:11:25] boohoo and moan and groan, but she chose
[2:11:28] rather to use her testimony to glorify
[2:11:31] the God of heaven that had saved her out
[2:11:33] of sin that had moved her out of the
[2:11:36] dance hall. She'd jump up and say,
[2:11:38] "Praise God, when I got saved, I didn't
[2:11:40] quit dancing. I used to dance in every
[2:11:43] dance hall in Muscogee County. But when
[2:11:46] I got saved, I didn't quit dancing. I
[2:11:49] just changed partners. Hallelujah.
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; She didn't know what algebra was.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; She didn't know what geometry was, but
[2:12:00] she knew what it was to find the bubble,
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; that glory covering.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; She went to work in it.
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; Listen, they had testimonies.
[2:12:14] The power of God would fall sometime o
[2:12:16] on a on a lunch break
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; and people would receive the baptism of
[2:12:21] the Holy Ghost
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; and superintendent would come down out
[2:12:26] of their lofty offices to see what was
[2:12:28] going on and and underlords would say to
[2:12:32] the supervis the big big wigs aren't
[2:12:34] what you going to do about it what you
[2:12:35] going to do about it aren't you going to
[2:12:36] put a stop to that they said to one I
[2:12:39] knew him well they said to one Methodist
[2:12:41] they said aren't you going to put a stop
[2:12:43] to them tongue talkers, them holy
[2:12:45] rollers, having a prayer meeting,
[2:12:46] getting all excited on the lunch break,
[2:12:49] turning this place upside down. You're a
[2:12:51] Methodist. What you going to do about
[2:12:52] it? He said, I'm going to get out of the
[2:12:54] way.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; What you going to do if it goes on
[2:12:59] beyond beyond the lunch break? He said,
[2:13:02] we'll face that when we get to it. But
[2:13:04] he said, here's what I've noticed. When
[2:13:06] they come out of that prayer meeting at
[2:13:08] the end of the aisle there, when they
[2:13:10] come out of that prayer meeting, he said
[2:13:12] they go to work with a new passion, with
[2:13:14] a new enthusiasm.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; They're either humming a humming a hymn
[2:13:18] or singing a song.
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; And we're getting more out of them than
[2:13:23] we are them that's been drunk all night
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; and come in here with a hangover. Come
[2:13:28] on, folks.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; People had it hard, but they found the
[2:13:32] place.
[2:13:36] You've got more than they had.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; You've got more than they had
[2:13:40] economically. We've got more than they
[2:13:42] had spiritually. We've got more than
[2:13:45] they had wordbased.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; More revelation than they had in that
[2:13:49] day.
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:13:54] And somebody will come in here. Well, I
[2:13:56] could praise the Lord if it wasn't for
[2:13:58] him.
[2:13:59] I could praise the Lord if it wasn't for
[2:14:00] her.
[2:14:04] There's a pavilion.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; There's a tabern. I got to hurry.
[2:14:09] There's a tabernacle. Listen to this.
[2:14:11] Psalm 76
[2:14:14] in Salem.
[2:14:18] Hallelujah.
[2:14:19] I have two homes.
[2:14:22] I have a home in Salem, Alabama. Salem,
[2:14:25] just up the hill. And I have a home in
[2:14:28] Jerusalem. an apartment in Jerusalem
[2:14:31] because of you folks.
[2:14:33] And and this word Saleem or Salem here
[2:14:36] is is a word that's used to describe
[2:14:38] Jerusalem in Jerusalem, which for us is
[2:14:41] a spiritual place. It's Zion spiritual,
[2:14:45] not just Zion geographical,
[2:14:48] but it's we're a Zion people. Yes, we
[2:14:51] are.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; You see, overcomers are going to sit
[2:14:55] with him in his throne, even as he has
[2:14:56] sat down with his father in his throne.
[2:14:59] That's the overcomer's throne. And
[2:15:01] that's Zion.
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; And it's not a cube, is it?
[2:15:08] &gt;&gt; 1500 miles. Yes. In every direction,
[2:15:11] including up.
[2:15:14] There's a revelation that goes with
[2:15:15] that. We got to hurry. In Salem also is
[2:15:18] his tabernacle and his dwelling place in
[2:15:20] Zion. There break he the arrows of the
[2:15:23] bow, the shield and the sword and the
[2:15:26] battle. And what's that last word?
[2:15:28] Sila.
[2:15:30] Sellah, it means pause
[2:15:35] and think on these things. Now, when we
[2:15:39] put a ceil
[2:15:42] there at the end, it means there's more
[2:15:43] to this than you get with a casual
[2:15:46] readover.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; The psalmist is saying to us, I'm going
[2:15:50] to build, God is going to build for his
[2:15:53] people a tabernacle.
[2:15:55] It's not a geographical place that
[2:15:58] you've got to get to. It's a spiritual
[2:16:01] position that you arrive in
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; where you understand the authority of a
[2:16:06] Zion company of people, an overcoming
[2:16:09] bride,
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; and you do something about it. You're
[2:16:13] not always responding to what the devil
[2:16:15] does.
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; You're just letting his errors go.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; You're responding to the word.
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:16:28] read between the lines.
[2:16:31] &gt;&gt; I don't say that. That's not my phrase.
[2:16:33] I rarely ever say that. So don't think
[2:16:35] that's something I pull out all the
[2:16:37] time. What I mean is there's something
[2:16:39] here for those who can have the cila
[2:16:43] in Judaism.
[2:16:45] this Psalm 27
[2:16:50] that we read in the beginning. For in
[2:16:53] the time of trouble, he shall hide me in
[2:16:55] his pavilion. In the secret of his
[2:16:56] tabernacle shall he hide me. In Judaism,
[2:16:59] the psalm Psalm 27 is read every day
[2:17:03] for 30 days leading up to the feast of
[2:17:05] trumpets.
[2:17:07] And it is known in Judaism as the
[2:17:09] wedding of the Messiah,
[2:17:12] the tabernacle.
[2:17:15] the tent,
[2:17:18] the pavilion.
[2:17:20] It's known this place of rest for the
[2:17:23] bride,
[2:17:25] a position in the word,
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; a place in Christ, in his side.
[2:17:32] It's known as the wedding of the
[2:17:33] Messiah.
[2:17:35] It's in Christ where the bride becomes
[2:17:37] wife.
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:41] It's in the word
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; where the bride becomes wife.
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; It's one thing to be engaged to Christ.
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; It's another thing to be his wife.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; A lot of church people have flings, one
[2:18:02] night stands with the bridegroom.
[2:18:07] He's not looking for a for just a lover.
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; He's looking for a wife.
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; Anybody here?
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham in the one of the very
[2:18:21] last sermons of his ministry
[2:18:25] in a little town now a little larger now
[2:18:28] than called Yuma, Arizona. Anybody ever
[2:18:32] been there? I've been to Yuma.
[2:18:36] almost on the Mexican border.
[2:18:41] They're having a banquet.
[2:18:45] Brother Brandham is speaking at the
[2:18:47] banquet.
[2:18:49] Brother Perry Green is there
[2:18:52] and many other names that you would
[2:18:55] know.
[2:18:59] There was confusion in the room.
[2:19:03] There was a woman standing in the back
[2:19:05] of the room, propped in the doorway,
[2:19:09] smoking a cigarette.
[2:19:13] She was the director of the kitchen
[2:19:16] staff.
[2:19:19] The waitresses and waiters kept coming
[2:19:21] in to clear the tables
[2:19:25] because Brother Brandon was speaking so
[2:19:27] long.
[2:19:29] They thought that they would cause
[2:19:32] enough disruption that he would just
[2:19:34] stop.
[2:19:36] But somehow he kept preaching.
[2:19:39] The sermon was called the rapture.
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; Anybody familiar with it?
[2:19:45] The sermon was called
[2:19:48] the rapture.
[2:19:52] Brother Brandham mentions the fact that
[2:19:54] he's distracted.
[2:19:57] They're moving around. There's a lot of
[2:19:59] problem, lot lot of rushing. They wanted
[2:20:01] him out. They wanted the people out even
[2:20:04] though it had been well paid for.
[2:20:08] Brother Green told me himself, he said,
[2:20:10] "I went and offered them whatever they
[2:20:12] would ask." He said, "I don't care what
[2:20:14] you ask. I will pay you whatever you ask
[2:20:18] if you will leave him alone.
[2:20:23] We want to hear what he has to say. And
[2:20:26] we I'll give you a check double what
[2:20:29] we've paid to rent this room for the
[2:20:31] evening. If you'll walk away and give us
[2:20:33] more time if you'll just leave us alone.
[2:20:36] I'll make sure. He said, "Here's I've
[2:20:38] got it. I'll write the check. Whatever I
[2:20:40] need to do."
[2:20:42] And finally, he found a little more
[2:20:44] liberty.
[2:20:46] And yet, it's one of the sermons that he
[2:20:48] asked
[2:20:50] not to be released.
[2:20:54] And we have it now. It was released
[2:20:56] right after his death.
[2:21:00] Why are you mentioning that tonight? I'm
[2:21:02] mentioning it because when we speak
[2:21:04] about rapture, we usually quote from
[2:21:07] Thessalonians or Corinthians.
[2:21:10] The dead in Christ shall rise first. We
[2:21:14] which are alive and remain shall be
[2:21:15] caught up to meet the Lord in the air
[2:21:18] with them to meet the Lord in the air.
[2:21:20] Or we read from Corinthians, corruption,
[2:21:23] putting on incorruption, the dead and
[2:21:26] Christ changing, don't we? You you
[2:21:28] you're familiar.
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we might use Revelation 4:1.
[2:21:32] Give me another minute.
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; We've got breakfast for you. Won't cost
[2:21:42] you a penny. It's not even dark outside
[2:21:46] yet.
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; Give me another minute. I don't have the
[2:21:50] money brother Green had evidently. I'd
[2:21:52] just write you a check and tell you how
[2:21:54] much will it cost you to sit there and
[2:21:55] help me a little more a little while
[2:21:56] longer.
[2:21:58] Some of you wouldn't get a penny because
[2:22:00] you haven't helped me at all anyway. But
[2:22:03] some of you have and I appreciate it
[2:22:04] greatly.
[2:22:07] But today I have to pay for an amen. I'm
[2:22:10] I'm just going to retire.
[2:22:15] You would think it would be Corinthians
[2:22:17] or or Thessalonians if a man's going to
[2:22:20] teach on the rapture. Maybe even
[2:22:22] Revelation 4 one where where the voice
[2:22:26] says to John, "Come up here. Come up
[2:22:28] higher." There's things I want to show
[2:22:30] you. There's a door open
[2:22:33] and I want to show you some things.
[2:22:36] Sometimes they use Enoch
[2:22:39] who walked with God and was not because
[2:22:43] God took him.
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; What you need to understand about Enoch
[2:22:47] was he was not before he was not.
[2:22:51] &gt;&gt; Because that phrase was not doesn't just
[2:22:53] mean he left the earth. It also means he
[2:22:56] was emptied of himself.
[2:22:59] &gt;&gt; So Enoch had to empty himself out
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; before he could
[2:23:06] be a was not
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; and leave the earth.
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; He just he just come on. Sometimes we
[2:23:14] might talk about uh Elijah
[2:23:17] who left here in a chariot pulled by
[2:23:20] horses of fire.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; But when brother Brandham was giving his
[2:23:26] text for the rapture message, he didn't
[2:23:29] use Corinthians. He didn't use
[2:23:30] Thessalonians. He didn't use Revelation
[2:23:32] 4. He didn't use Enoch. He didn't use
[2:23:34] Elite. He used Psalm 27.
[2:23:41] For in the time of trouble,
[2:23:44] he shall hide me in his pavilion. In the
[2:23:49] secret of his tabernacle, he shall hide
[2:23:52] me. He shall set me upon a rock. And now
[2:23:55] shall mine head be lifted up above my
[2:23:57] enemies round about me. Therefore will I
[2:23:59] offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of
[2:24:02] joy. I will sing. Yeah, I will sing
[2:24:03] praises unto the Lord. This was the text
[2:24:06] that he felt the inspiration to use for
[2:24:09] a message that he was going to preach
[2:24:11] and teach on rapture.
[2:24:14] So, there's something about this
[2:24:15] pavilion. There's something about this
[2:24:18] tabernacle. There's something about this
[2:24:20] shelter, this covert, this refuge.
[2:24:24] There's something about this rock.
[2:24:27] There's something about this hiding
[2:24:29] place.
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:32] That speaks of of rapture.
[2:24:36] &gt;&gt; It speaks of translation.
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; It speaks of a change.
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; It speaks of a difference that the word
[2:24:46] makes.
[2:24:49] &gt;&gt; It speaks about something that takes
[2:24:51] place in privacy,
[2:24:55] &gt;&gt; not in the public view,
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; not a public show.
[2:25:02] The door is closed.
[2:25:05] &gt;&gt; Enter into thy
[2:25:08] closet.
[2:25:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:25:09] &gt;&gt; Or chamber.
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; Close the door.
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; That's where I'm going to talk to you.
[2:25:16] That's where you're going to find your
[2:25:17] refuge.
[2:25:19] &gt;&gt; That's where the change is going to take
[2:25:21] place.
[2:25:22] &gt;&gt; That's where you'll go in one way and
[2:25:23] come out another. Did you hear that?
[2:25:27] You'll go in one way and come out
[2:25:29] another way.
[2:25:37] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt hide me. Psalm 31:20. Thou
[2:25:40] shalt hide them in the secret of thy
[2:25:42] presence from the pride of man.
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; Thou shalt keep them secretly in a
[2:25:47] pavilion.
[2:25:57] Oh, little bride,
[2:25:59] you're misunderstood now.
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; But God's got a change coming for you.
[2:26:08] &gt;&gt; He's going to hide you from the tongues.
[2:26:11] &gt;&gt; The strife of tongues, the sting of
[2:26:14] rejection, the bitter dregs of offense.
[2:26:23] The word is going to have a body to live
[2:26:26] in again.
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; All that he was, all that Jehovah was,
[2:26:34] all that Yahweh was,
[2:26:37] &gt;&gt; he poured into a body of flesh,
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; a house of flesh, a body thou hast
[2:26:44] prepared me.
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; And Jesus Christ was the fullness
[2:26:54] No, that doesn't make
[2:26:55] &gt;&gt; tuness
[2:26:57] any more than it makes.
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; Because Jesus told them, I'm not sending
[2:27:04] a substitute.
[2:27:06] &gt;&gt; He said, I will come to you.
[2:27:11] &gt;&gt; They may have been looking for him to
[2:27:12] come in in a physical body. He came, but
[2:27:16] he didn't come in the body he had used
[2:27:18] before. He came like pillar like tongues
[2:27:20] of fire. He came like a rushing wind and
[2:27:23] he filled all of them who were sitting
[2:27:25] in that upper chamber.
[2:27:27] &gt;&gt; And the devil is about to have a nervous
[2:27:29] breakdown because he thought my I have
[2:27:31] finally won. I have defeated one Jesus.
[2:27:34] I have put him out of his misery. I've
[2:27:37] hung him there. I've I've laid him there
[2:27:38] in a grave never to be heard from again.
[2:27:41] Then he gets up from the grave. He
[2:27:43] resurrects from the grave and the enemy
[2:27:45] doesn't know what to do about him. Now,
[2:27:47] at the upper room,
[2:27:50] &gt;&gt; there's not just one Jesus coming out
[2:27:52] the door. There's at least 120.
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Is that blasphemy?" Not
[2:28:00] at all. This same spirit that raised
[2:28:04] Jesus from the dead shall dwell in you.
[2:28:11] &gt;&gt; It shall also quicken your mortal body.
[2:28:17] Who is this living inside of you?
[2:28:22] &gt;&gt; I will not leave you comfortless.
[2:28:26] &gt;&gt; I will come to you.
[2:28:37] No wonder they wanted to make him a
[2:28:38] third person
[2:28:42] because they couldn't deal with the
[2:28:44] reality
[2:28:47] that what was in him was now in them.
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; Now he was that word in fullness.
[2:28:58] You are that word in measure. But the
[2:29:01] measure of that word that is in you is
[2:29:03] fullness to you. What do you What do you
[2:29:05] mean by that? I mean he is complete in
[2:29:08] you, but you aren't all of him.
[2:29:12] &gt;&gt; Cuz I've got him, too.
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; Do you understand?
[2:29:16] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:29:17] &gt;&gt; If you go out there and get you a
[2:29:19] spoonful of the ocean, you don't have
[2:29:21] all the ocean,
[2:29:23] &gt;&gt; but you've got everything the ocean has.
[2:29:29] That drop, that spoonful is a
[2:29:31] representation of every mineral. And
[2:29:33] whatever is in that water, that's a
[2:29:35] representation of it. And that's what we
[2:29:38] have. Not just a thimble full. But now
[2:29:41] to listen, when you get saved, the
[2:29:43] spirit of Christ, that Holy Spirit
[2:29:46] certainly comes in and regenerates your
[2:29:48] life. No doubt about it. We're not
[2:29:51] talking about that. We're talking about
[2:29:52] an upper room experience. We're talking
[2:29:55] about a baptism of the Holy Ghost. And
[2:29:57] somebody say fire.
[2:29:59] &gt;&gt; Fire.
[2:30:01] &gt;&gt; Whoa. Who said that? Was that you?
[2:30:04] Mercy. Fire.
[2:30:06] Say it again. Mercy. Fire. Say it. Say
[2:30:10] it again. Fire.
[2:30:13] The Holy Ghost. And
[2:30:16] &gt;&gt; we're closing.
[2:30:21] I'm going to come to this place now. I
[2:30:23] think I've already been there where
[2:30:25] you'll just have to see what you can do
[2:30:26] with this
[2:30:28] in a message questions and answers on
[2:30:30] the seals. I've this whole series I've
[2:30:32] been preaching I've hardly made
[2:30:34] quotations.
[2:30:36] I didn't want to make quotations tonight
[2:30:39] but I don't have a choice. I have to
[2:30:41] make a few quotations because it was
[2:30:43] part of my instructions.
[2:30:45] Can I give you one more verse?
[2:30:48] Song of Songs 14. Draw me
[2:30:52] Draw me,
[2:30:54] we will run after thee. This is the
[2:30:56] bride talking.
[2:30:58] Draw me, we will run after thee. The
[2:31:01] king hath brought me into his chambers.
[2:31:04] There it is. Pavilion, tabernacle,
[2:31:09] &gt;&gt; tent,
[2:31:11] shelter,
[2:31:13] refuge,
[2:31:15] &gt;&gt; hiding place.
[2:31:17] &gt;&gt; We will be glad and rejoice in thee. We
[2:31:19] will remember thy love more than wine.
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; The upright love thee. Any upright in
[2:31:26] this room?
[2:31:27] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him?
[2:31:29] &gt;&gt; That word chambers there is a masculine
[2:31:31] noun referring to a parlor, a room, an
[2:31:34] inner room, a room of lying down, a
[2:31:37] sleeping room, an innermost part to
[2:31:39] close in on every side to surround. The
[2:31:42] word means a compartment or a room
[2:31:47] within a building.
[2:31:49] A room within a room.
[2:31:58] What is the Holy of Holies?
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; A room within a room.
[2:32:06] I will meet you there. What is that? A
[2:32:10] room within a room.
[2:32:13] This is not a chamber just where you
[2:32:16] where you where you built the cow.
[2:32:19] This is a chamber where there is
[2:32:21] relationship
[2:32:28] engaged
[2:32:30] becoming
[2:32:32] wife married
[2:32:36] in the message questions and answers on
[2:32:38] the seals. I'm just going to have to
[2:32:39] just cut it off and finish tomorrow.
[2:32:43] And finally, one day
[2:32:46] he said,
[2:32:48] "John the Baptist."
[2:32:53] All this time,
[2:32:55] John the Baptist.
[2:32:58] I've been with some of you in the cave
[2:33:00] of John the Baptist in Anaram,
[2:33:04] a place that was discovered
[2:33:07] less than 30 years ago.
[2:33:11] A place where it's believed
[2:33:13] John the Baptist met with believers
[2:33:18] when he was being threatened
[2:33:22] before he was arrested and beheaded.
[2:33:28] We have visited many times the village
[2:33:32] of Anaram where the Bible tells us John
[2:33:34] the Baptist was born.
[2:33:37] He was a voice of one crying in the
[2:33:41] wilderness, prepare ye the way of the
[2:33:43] Lord.
[2:33:44] He came a spirit and power of Elijah
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; to introduce planet earth to the first
[2:33:55] coming.
[2:33:56] of Messiah
[2:33:58] the word in flesh. It's powerful
[2:34:01] ministry he had. He wore camel skin
[2:34:07] and he didn't have an apostolic hairo.
[2:34:14] The apostolic uh preach so hard against
[2:34:17] the beards.
[2:34:23] Our movement does too.
[2:34:29] Well, I want you to know that there was
[2:34:31] nothing Greek about John the Baptist
[2:34:36] or the Messiah.
[2:34:39] They were rugged men.
[2:34:43] His hair was in his eyes.
[2:34:47] No, no uh brillow cream to slick it
[2:34:50] back. His
[2:34:53] beard was tangled in his in his uh
[2:34:57] locust wings
[2:35:01] and honey.
[2:35:04] No wonder they thought he was crazy.
[2:35:08] He didn't wear a robe of a of a cleric,
[2:35:10] of a of a sage. He he wore a a a loin
[2:35:15] cloth made out of camel hair.
[2:35:19] He had one message.
[2:35:24] Prepare the way of the Lord. He's
[2:35:25] coming.
[2:35:27] &gt;&gt; Prepare the way of the Lord. He's
[2:35:28] coming. Prepare the way of the Lord.
[2:35:30] He's coming. Prepare the way of the
[2:35:31] Lord. He's coming. And one day, guess
[2:35:33] what? He's standing kneedeep in the
[2:35:35] Jordan River. And his cousin comes
[2:35:38] walking down the trail to the water
[2:35:40] &gt;&gt; and comes waiting out in the water. And
[2:35:42] what does he scream? By revelation. by
[2:35:44] instantaneous
[2:35:46] revelation that drops down in his heart.
[2:35:48] He's always known him as his cousin.
[2:35:50] He's always known him as the son of his
[2:35:53] mother's sister.
[2:35:56] &gt;&gt; He knew him very, very well. But as he
[2:35:59] came down that hill, uh eyes, his eyes
[2:36:02] were open. Isab was applied. They come
[2:36:05] popping open. And he no longer saw his
[2:36:08] cousin, his aunt's son. He now screamed,
[2:36:11] "Behold the lamb of God that taketh away
[2:36:16] the sins of the world." That was enough
[2:36:19] to have him killed on the spot. But he
[2:36:22] couldn't contain himself.
[2:36:26] &gt;&gt; He did what he came to do.
[2:36:29] Come on.
[2:36:30] &gt;&gt; All those years of preparation in the
[2:36:32] wilderness, hiding in the cave, all the
[2:36:34] things he had to go through to just to
[2:36:36] get to that one moment.
[2:36:39] Behold the lamb of God that taketh away
[2:36:41] the sin of the world. How can I baptize
[2:36:44] you? I must needs that you would baptize
[2:36:47] me. Here he comes. Fan is in his hand.
[2:36:51] Come on. You know the story.
[2:36:53] Brother Random says here finally one day
[2:36:56] he said, "Behold, there he is. There is
[2:36:58] a lamb of God. takes away the sin of the
[2:37:00] world. Said, "And my time is up now.
[2:37:06] My time is up now.
[2:37:09] I've introduced you to him."
[2:37:14] Maybe those words aren't recorded in the
[2:37:16] Gospels,
[2:37:19] but we know that it wasn't long after
[2:37:20] that his head was chopped off
[2:37:24] and served on a platter
[2:37:27] because he preached against double
[2:37:29] marriage
[2:37:32] adultery.
[2:37:34] He said, "It is not lawful for thee to
[2:37:36] have thy brother Philip's wife."
[2:37:42] And they looked for an opportunity to
[2:37:44] cut his head off.
[2:37:46] And that he got it, didn't he?
[2:37:49] I've introduced you to him. I've done
[2:37:51] what I've come to do. He'll Watch,
[2:37:54] watch, watch, watch. I must go.
[2:37:58] Read it for me.
[2:38:01] &gt;&gt; I must decrease now. I must go off the
[2:38:04] scene. Here's something powerful.
[2:38:08] He'll take over from here.
[2:38:17] powerful.
[2:38:20] Elijah said, "If you see me leaving,
[2:38:28] you'll get a double portion. Musicians,
[2:38:30] would you please come? If you see me
[2:38:33] when I leave,
[2:38:36] you'll get a double portion." And then
[2:38:38] what does Elijah going to do? He turns
[2:38:40] to Elisha one day and he says, "I'm
[2:38:42] going up here. Stay here."
[2:38:46] &gt;&gt; Isn't that strange?
[2:38:49] He's just told him, "If you see me when
[2:38:51] I leave, you can have a double portion."
[2:38:56] And now he says, "I'm going to go up
[2:38:57] here and do such and such. You stay
[2:38:59] here. I'll be right back." Elisha says,
[2:39:01] "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. My
[2:39:04] mama didn't raise no fool.
[2:39:06] You said if I saw you leave, how do I
[2:39:08] know if you get up there doing such and
[2:39:10] such that you won't leave from there?
[2:39:13] &gt;&gt; Wherever you go, I'm going with you
[2:39:15] because when you leave,
[2:39:20] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to get carried away with
[2:39:21] the sons of the prophets and just act
[2:39:23] like the rest of them. He when when I if
[2:39:26] I get to see I'm going to see you leave
[2:39:29] &gt;&gt; and then I'm going to have that double
[2:39:30] portion.
[2:39:32] &gt;&gt; He followed him around, didn't he? On
[2:39:35] the day that it was time for Elijah to
[2:39:37] decrease,
[2:39:43] his time was up.
[2:39:45] The Lord comes to get him in a chariot
[2:39:47] and horses drawn like fire, horses of
[2:39:50] fire drawing a carriage.
[2:39:53] Elijah just gets in and starts going
[2:39:55] off. Somebody said, "I don't really
[2:39:56] believe that. It's figurative. Don't you
[2:39:57] think?" I don't think it is.
[2:40:01] You don't mean to tell me that in 2025
[2:40:03] you really believe that a chariot from
[2:40:05] God came down with horses of fire and
[2:40:07] picked up the pro. Oh yes,
[2:40:13] &gt;&gt; anybody else's
[2:40:15] &gt;&gt; crazy as I am.
[2:40:17] &gt;&gt; I believe it. I believe it. I believe
[2:40:19] it. I believe it. I tell you what else I
[2:40:20] believe. I don't believe it was a
[2:40:21] vision. I believe it was real because
[2:40:24] his mantle
[2:40:28] &gt;&gt; came floating down from the sky.
[2:40:32] &gt;&gt; Elisha said, "That's it.
[2:40:37] &gt;&gt; That's it."
[2:40:39] &gt;&gt; The scripture said he went over and got
[2:40:42] that mantle. He wrapped it around his
[2:40:44] arm like he'd seen the prophet do. He
[2:40:47] struck the water like he saw that
[2:40:49] prophet do. And guess what? God did the
[2:40:53] same for Elisha
[2:40:55] [Applause]
[2:40:57] &gt;&gt; that he had done for Elijah.
[2:41:00] &gt;&gt; Where is the Lord God of Elijah? Here he
[2:41:04] is.
[2:41:06] &gt;&gt; He's in a bride.
[2:41:08] &gt;&gt; He's in a bride.
[2:41:10] Anybody here?
[2:41:13] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read one more thing.
[2:41:15] I have to
[2:41:20] being led of the Holy Spirit.
[2:41:21] Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[2:41:25] I'm skipping.
[2:41:26] And watch, he's always scriptural.
[2:41:30] He said, ' Don't did Did not our Lord
[2:41:32] say
[2:41:34] when the when thou prayest, be not like
[2:41:36] the hypocrite that that likes to take a
[2:41:39] show, make a show, said, "Enter into the
[2:41:42] secret closet." And when you're done, so
[2:41:45] when you've done to close the door, then
[2:41:49] pray to your father what seeth in
[2:41:51] secret. And
[2:41:53] he that seeth in secret, he's
[2:41:56] paraphrasing,
[2:41:57] &gt;&gt; shall reward thee
[2:42:00] openly, it's Matthew 6 3-6, if you want
[2:42:04] to look at it when you get home,
[2:42:08] and he said, "You remember that name
[2:42:13] that you were hunting, that time that
[2:42:16] you dreamed about?"
[2:42:19] And I said, "Yes."
[2:42:21] He said, "I'll meet you in there.
[2:42:33] that name that you dreamed about
[2:42:38] that that thing that
[2:42:40] you remembered it
[2:42:43] you were you were looking to try to find
[2:42:45] it again after you dreamed
[2:42:49] that word let's say
[2:42:53] I'll meet you in there
[2:42:56] and this time it won't be a public show
[2:43:02] &gt;&gt; it's It's a pavilion.
[2:43:04] It's a tabernacle. It's the folds of a
[2:43:08] tent.
[2:43:09] It's in secret. It's a refuge. It's a
[2:43:13] hiding place.
[2:43:15] It's a holy of holies.
[2:43:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:19] &gt;&gt; It's a room within a room.
[2:43:24] &gt;&gt; I'll meet you in there.
[2:43:26] And this time it won't be a public show.
[2:43:29] Now watch what what his understanding of
[2:43:32] this vision was at the time. He said,
[2:43:34] "Now we got the tent in making.
[2:43:40] We're having a tent made." He said,
[2:43:43] "And then in there I'll be able to carry
[2:43:46] a prayer line right on through." Now you
[2:43:48] remember I speak this before it comes to
[2:43:50] pass. The exceedingly
[2:43:55] abundantly
[2:43:57] is fixing to take place.
[2:44:00] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Sounds like a double
[2:44:02] portion.
[2:44:04] It sounds like if a people can recognize
[2:44:09] when he leaves,
[2:44:12] if they can recognize his decrees,
[2:44:17] so that Jesus
[2:44:20] Hey,
[2:44:22] [Applause]
[2:44:23] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist said, "I must decrease
[2:44:26] &gt;&gt; that he might increase.
[2:44:29] &gt;&gt; I only came to introduce you to him. I
[2:44:32] came to show you who he is." Behold,
[2:44:36] &gt;&gt; the lamb of God. History tells us they
[2:44:39] tried to make a cult
[2:44:41] following John the Baptist
[2:44:48] like some have tried to do in our day
[2:44:50] like some have done in our day
[2:44:53] &gt;&gt; because they couldn't see the decrease.
[2:44:55] You've got to be able to see both.
[2:44:57] You've got to be able to see the
[2:44:58] decrease of the of the messenger and
[2:45:01] you've got to be able to see the
[2:45:03] increase of the message.
[2:45:06] And you can't do that if you hang on a
[2:45:08] quart or two that you pull out of a
[2:45:09] church age book written by Lee Vale.
[2:45:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:15] &gt;&gt; Where we are told that the message and
[2:45:16] the messenger are one.
[2:45:22] But we understand that the message is
[2:45:25] Jesus.
[2:45:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:26] &gt;&gt; And the messenger is the voice of one
[2:45:28] crying in the wilderness. the friend of
[2:45:30] the bridegroom,
[2:45:32] &gt;&gt; the one who introduces us.
[2:45:34] Come on.
[2:45:36] &gt;&gt; So if there is a people who can see the
[2:45:38] messenger decreasing while the while the
[2:45:41] message which is the revelation of Jesus
[2:45:43] Christ, you see that increasing
[2:45:46] &gt;&gt; then to those people they're going to
[2:45:48] find a hiding place in the day of
[2:45:50] trouble, in the time of distress, in the
[2:45:53] hour of peril and and horror and
[2:45:56] heartache. I'm going to hide them
[2:45:58] somewhere. Amen.
[2:46:00] &gt;&gt; Not in a physical geographical location,
[2:46:03] &gt;&gt; in a spiritual position.
[2:46:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:46:08] A song in their mouth. Praise God. No
[2:46:12] matter what's going on around them, the
[2:46:14] change has come.
[2:46:18] &gt;&gt; Like every other change,
[2:46:20] &gt;&gt; the real change is always inside out,
[2:46:25] &gt;&gt; not outside in.
[2:46:27] I'm closing. You've already said that.
[2:46:29] Yeah. The tense in the making and then
[2:46:32] and there I'll be able to carry the the
[2:46:34] exceedingly abundant and these things
[2:46:36] here that you see now
[2:46:38] will be amateur
[2:46:40] to what our Lord is fixing to do.
[2:46:43] &gt;&gt; You just remember with all your heart
[2:46:45] and live for him now and be reverent.
[2:46:49] &gt;&gt; Sounds like good advice,
[2:46:52] &gt;&gt; doesn't it?
[2:46:53] &gt;&gt; Just be yourself. Just be Mrs. Door. for
[2:46:56] Mr. Doe and love the Lord and just move
[2:46:58] on with a true heart before him and love
[2:47:00] him. He will take care of the rest of
[2:47:02] it. 1956. Let's stand.
[2:47:06] And just for those of you who will not
[2:47:08] be here tomorrow,
[2:47:19] 65
[2:47:21] 711.
[2:47:23] But now speaking on what the service is
[2:47:25] and going to Africa and the things that
[2:47:27] we we've tried to arrange for these few
[2:47:30] days here in Indiana
[2:47:32] somehow or another. Lord, it may be you
[2:47:35] are driving us to that tent
[2:47:41] to make that vision fulfilled.
[2:47:48] July the 11th,
[2:47:50] 65.
[2:47:52] It's still Say it again.
[2:47:56] Brother Eddie Miller was 14 years old on
[2:48:00] that day. Interesting.
[2:48:05] 63. It's almost here exceeding
[2:48:07] abundantly. It's 1965,
[2:48:11] July 11. It may be you're driving us to
[2:48:14] that tent to make that vision fulfilled.
[2:48:18] So, thy will be done. We've committed it
[2:48:20] this way the best of our understanding.
[2:48:21] So, we pray Lord, is there anything too
[2:48:23] contrary to your will? You'll if there
[2:48:25] is if there is anything contrary to your
[2:48:28] will, you'll make it known to us that we
[2:48:29] might know to do your perfect will.
[2:48:32] &gt;&gt; Three years later, still waiting,
[2:48:36] still waiting on the fulfillment of a
[2:48:37] vision, of a tent, of a room within a
[2:48:40] room, a prayer line. One go they go in
[2:48:42] one way, one go another. I have dozens
[2:48:45] of places where he said, "Maybe we'll
[2:48:46] try that the next time we're here. Maybe
[2:48:48] maybe we'll put that tent right up here
[2:48:50] in Jeffersonville. Maybe we'll do such
[2:48:52] and such. We've got the tent in the
[2:48:54] making. The money is already in place to
[2:48:56] buy that tent.
[2:49:03] You you break that vision into three
[2:49:04] phases and you understand that if the
[2:49:07] first two phases of that were spiritual
[2:49:10] in nature, they had a spiritual
[2:49:12] understanding, a spiritual
[2:49:13] interpretation.
[2:49:15] Why would we come to think that the last
[2:49:17] part has a natural interpretation? And
[2:49:20] why is it that after all these years
[2:49:22] there would be anybody on the planet
[2:49:25] still looking for a physical tent?
[2:49:28] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:49:32] When we know by the word of God, it's
[2:49:35] more than a physical piece of canvas.
[2:49:39] &gt;&gt; It's a place to hide in Christ.
[2:49:42] &gt;&gt; It's a spiritual position where we get
[2:49:45] up above our problems and our troubles
[2:49:47] and our trials and we see Jesus
[2:49:50] everywhere we look. We see him because
[2:49:53] he's with us. Even in us, his life is
[2:49:58] bringing the change.
[2:50:00] &gt;&gt; And when those around us are in
[2:50:02] desperate
[2:50:04] uh broken horror
[2:50:07] because life is bashing them against the
[2:50:10] rocks.
[2:50:12] This little bride just reaches out to
[2:50:13] kiss the rock
[2:50:16] &gt;&gt; because she has a revelation that he's
[2:50:18] the rock I'm hiding on. He's the rock
[2:50:20] I'm singing on. He's the rock I'm
[2:50:22] sitting on. Let me tell you, no matter
[2:50:24] what comes your way for the rest of your
[2:50:26] duration here on planet Earth, there's a
[2:50:28] hiding place for you, there's a position
[2:50:30] in the word for you. There's a
[2:50:33] manifestation of the life of Christ in
[2:50:35] you if you'll yield yourself to the
[2:50:37] truth. Quit trying to make things appear
[2:50:41] in physical form when God is changing us
[2:50:43] always from the inside out. Change us,
[2:50:46] Lord. Change us tonight. May we be
[2:50:49] changed, Lord. May we catch a glimpse
[2:50:52] that this word is line upon line and
[2:50:56] precept upon precept. Lord Jesus, help
[2:51:00] us to see that you're talking about your
[2:51:03] little bride, your the little bodies,
[2:51:06] that many membered body of Christ. The
[2:51:10] change taking place is a is a a a change
[2:51:14] from head knowledge
[2:51:18] &gt;&gt; to heart knowledge. Yes, Lord.
[2:51:21] &gt;&gt; Where we don't have to think it up, we
[2:51:23] live it out.
[2:51:25] &gt;&gt; Play something. Into thy chamber.
[2:51:30] Into thy chamber. Be free. Holy Spirit,
[2:51:34] speak to me gently as I close the door.
[2:51:38] Heavenly lover,
[2:51:40] let thy presence cover.
[2:51:43] Shikina unending
[2:51:46] is all I long for.
[2:51:49] Let's come and worship the Lord before
[2:51:51] we leave today. Give me the words. Into
[2:51:55] thy chamber
[2:51:58] be free. Holy
[2:52:02] Spirit,
[2:52:04] speak to
[2:52:07] me gently
[2:52:09] as I close
[2:52:12] the door.
[2:52:15] Oh heavenly
[2:52:19] lover,
[2:52:21] let thy presence
[2:52:24] cover
[2:52:27] shakina
[2:52:29] unending
[2:52:32] is all I long for. Give me a verse.
[2:52:38] Father,
[2:52:40] I worship
[2:52:43] you out of my spirit,
[2:52:49] blessing
[2:52:51] and thanking
[2:52:54] you in my
[2:52:57] own way.
[2:53:00] your heart.
[2:53:02] I covet,
[2:53:05] Lord, your will
[2:53:08] and your purpose. He needs you to tell
[2:53:10] him that tonight.
[2:53:15] &gt;&gt; Into submission.
[2:53:18] &gt;&gt; I surrender.
[2:53:20] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:53:22] into
[2:53:24] thy chamber.
[2:53:27] Be free. Tell him
[2:53:31] &gt;&gt; I give you permission
[2:53:34] &gt;&gt; to be free.
[2:53:38] &gt;&gt; No more restriction.
[2:53:41] [Music]
[2:53:43] Heavenly lover.
[2:53:56] [Music]
[2:54:05] &gt;&gt; Listen to this verse. Come my
[2:54:09] beloved
[2:54:12] Be my Lord
[2:54:15] and Master
[2:54:18] as I yield
[2:54:20] myself.
[2:54:23] Unite me
[2:54:26] to thee.
[2:54:27] [Music]
[2:54:29] Let thy holy
[2:54:31] word wrap around me.
[2:54:35] This day I plead
[2:54:39] my defense,
[2:54:42] protection,
[2:54:43] and my covering.
[2:54:46] &gt;&gt; Do you hear the language? Covering me.
[2:54:49] Sorry about that. And
[2:54:54] [Music]
[2:55:01] &gt;&gt; I want to hear you speak to me, Lord.
[2:55:09] Oh, this misunderstanding has got to be
[2:55:11] about something.
[2:55:14] &gt;&gt; There's got to be something on the other
[2:55:16] side of this scrutiny.
[2:55:20] &gt;&gt; Let your word wrap around me.
[2:55:25] &gt;&gt; Unite me to thee.
[2:55:38] Now on my journey,
[2:55:42] the wine press
[2:55:44] falls heavy,
[2:55:47] but it's bringing
[2:55:50] forth only
[2:55:53] the best
[2:55:55] of the while.
[2:55:58] So I pressed toward
[2:56:01] the mark for
[2:56:04] the prize of
[2:56:07] I calling
[2:56:09] to be a part of
[2:56:12] that beautiful
[2:56:16] lady
[2:56:18] the bride. Sing it from your heart into
[2:56:24] [Music]
[2:56:26] &gt;&gt; be free.
[2:56:32] Speak to me gently
[2:56:37] &gt;&gt; and I'll close the door.
[2:56:39] &gt;&gt; I'll shut the world out.
[2:56:41] &gt;&gt; I'll shut the internet out. I'll shut I
[2:56:45] have to out
[2:56:47] &gt;&gt; so that I can be changed.
[2:56:50] &gt;&gt; I can find my hiding place.
[2:57:00] Come and sing that.
[2:57:04] &gt;&gt; Keep worshiping and singing that chorus
[2:57:06] for a moment. Into
[2:57:09] &gt;&gt; thy chamber
[2:57:12] be free. Holy
[2:57:15] Spirit,
[2:57:18] &gt;&gt; speak to
[2:57:20] me gently
[2:57:23] as I close the door.
[2:57:29] Heavenly
[2:57:32] lover
[2:57:34] let thy presence
[2:57:37] cover
[2:57:42] the building
[2:57:45] is all I long for.
[2:57:51] into
[2:57:53] thy chamber.
[2:57:56] Be free. Holy
[2:57:59] Spirit,
[2:58:02] &gt;&gt; speak to me gently
[2:58:07] as I close
[2:58:10] the door.

[2:58:16] love the earth
[2:58:18] let thy presence
[2:58:21] cover
[2:58:25] [Music]
[2:58:27] unending
[2:58:29] is all I
[2:58:35] [Music]
[2:58:38] journey
[2:58:40] &gt;&gt; the wine press.
[2:58:43] falls heavy,
[2:58:45] but it is bringing
[2:58:48] forth the only
[2:58:51] &gt;&gt; the best.
[2:58:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. The best.
[2:58:58] [Music]
[2:59:03] &gt;&gt; Don't slack him now.
[2:59:06] Press press
[2:59:09] of that beautiful
[2:59:14] lady.
[2:59:17] &gt;&gt; One last time into thy chamber.
[2:59:20] &gt;&gt; Into
[2:59:22] thy chamber,
[2:59:24] &gt;&gt; be free.
[2:59:26] Holy
[2:59:28] Spirit,
[2:59:29] &gt;&gt; speak to me gently. Speak to me gently
[2:59:35] &gt;&gt; as I close

[2:59:40] &gt;&gt; Heavenly lover,
[2:59:42] &gt;&gt; heavenly
[2:59:44] lover.
[2:59:47] And thy presence
[2:59:50] covered
[2:59:55] [Music]
[2:59:58] is all I long for.
[3:00:03] You are worthy of it all.
[3:00:07] &gt;&gt; Worship the Lord with him now. Let it
[3:00:09] come from your inner being.
[3:00:11] &gt;&gt; You are worthy of it all. Let the spirit
[3:00:14] of the Lord surround you as you stand
[3:00:17] here tonight.
[3:00:18] &gt;&gt; For from you are all things
[3:00:22] and are all things.
[3:00:26] &gt;&gt; Change us.
[3:00:27] &gt;&gt; You deserve the glory.
[3:00:31] &gt;&gt; Open our eyes to see.
[3:00:33] &gt;&gt; Lord, you are worthy of it all.
[3:00:38] &gt;&gt; May we go in one way and come out
[3:00:40] another. You are worthy of it all.
[3:00:45] &gt;&gt; Maybe he said about us on the other
[3:00:47] side. They're just like him.
[3:00:49] &gt;&gt; For you are all things.
[3:00:52] &gt;&gt; They smell like him. They live like him.
[3:00:54] They move like him.
[3:00:57] &gt;&gt; God, you deserve the glory.
[3:01:00] &gt;&gt; Oh God, it's not about anybody but you,
[3:01:03] Jesus.
[3:01:05] &gt;&gt; Jesus. and all the saints.
[3:01:13] &gt;&gt; Come on, worship him.
[3:01:14] &gt;&gt; Bow
[3:01:16] before your throne.
[3:01:19] &gt;&gt; Love on him before we go.
[3:01:21] &gt;&gt; And all the elders
[3:01:25] cast
[3:01:26] &gt;&gt; cast their crowns
[3:01:27] &gt;&gt; crowns before the lamb
[3:01:30] of God. And master, you're worthy. You
[3:01:34] are worthy of it all.
[3:01:38] &gt;&gt; He's calling you.
[3:01:40] &gt;&gt; He's calling you.
[3:01:42] &gt;&gt; Worthy of it all.
[3:01:44] &gt;&gt; Come and stand under my pavilion.
[3:01:48] &gt;&gt; Come hide in my tabernacle.
[3:01:55] &gt;&gt; May you be found beneath the fountains
[3:01:57] of my tent.
[3:02:00] My God, God on Zion is for you.
[3:02:04] &gt;&gt; You are worthy of it all.
[3:02:06] &gt;&gt; He's calling you into his word,
[3:02:10] &gt;&gt; Lord. You are worthy of it all.
[3:02:15] [Music]
[3:02:18] For from you.
[3:02:20] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid to follow him. into
[3:02:24] all things.
[3:02:25] &gt;&gt; Go in and let the veil fall behind you,
[3:02:28] &gt;&gt; shutting you into the room within the
[3:02:30] room.
[3:02:32] &gt;&gt; The holiest of holies.
[3:02:33] &gt;&gt; You are worthy of it all.
[3:02:37] You are worthy of all.
[3:02:38] &gt;&gt; You'll never teach Pentecostal babies.
[3:02:41] &gt;&gt; You are worthy of it all
[3:02:44] &gt;&gt; how to see in the spirit.
[3:02:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, for you are. Let him grow you up in
[3:02:51] the wine press.
[3:02:54] &gt;&gt; Let him throw you up in the vessel of
[3:02:56] misunderstanding.
[3:02:57] Glory
[3:03:05] &gt;&gt; day and night, night and day.
[3:03:10] &gt;&gt; That's your praise. That's your praise.
[3:03:14] &gt;&gt; That's the essence of what he's doing in
[3:03:16] your life. Let it
[3:03:18] rise and
[3:03:22] night and day. Let it bridal intercise.
[3:03:30] [Music]
[3:03:35] &gt;&gt; Nobody has his heart like this.
[3:03:39] [Music]
[3:03:41] both day and night, night and day. Let
[3:03:45] it srise
[3:03:49] day and night. Night and day
[3:03:53] [Music]
[3:03:56] and night, night and day.
[3:04:01] You are worthy of
[3:04:07] Jesus. Lord, you are worthy of it all.
[3:04:12] &gt;&gt; Don't rush yourself.
[3:04:14] &gt;&gt; Stand in his booth.
[3:04:16] &gt;&gt; Offer up. You are all
[3:04:18] &gt;&gt; cover us, Lord.
[3:04:20] [Music]
[3:04:22] &gt;&gt; Like Ruth,
[3:04:24] &gt;&gt; you deserve. May we find ourselves
[3:04:26] underneath the garment of Boaz, our
[3:04:29] kinsman, redeemer,
[3:04:31] &gt;&gt; worthy of it all.
[3:04:34] [Music]
[3:04:37] Oh Lord, you are worthy of it all.
[3:04:44] Oh, for you are all things
[3:04:49] and you are all things. You deserve God.
[3:04:53] You deserve the glory.
[3:04:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, you're worthy of it,
[3:04:59] &gt;&gt; Lord. You are worthy of it all.
[3:05:03] [Music]
[3:05:04] You are worthy, Lord.
[3:05:07] You are worthy of it all.
[3:05:13] From you for you are all
[3:05:18] to
[3:05:21] &gt;&gt; you deserve the glory.
[3:05:22] &gt;&gt; You deserve the glory.
[3:05:25] &gt;&gt; Anoint our eyes with thyself tonight.
[3:05:29] &gt;&gt; May wish your breath
[3:05:32] in our lungs.
[3:05:35] So we pour out our praise. We pour out
[3:05:40] our praise into your breath. your breath
[3:05:43] in our lives.
[3:05:46] So we pour out our praise to you.
[3:05:52] It's your breath
[3:05:55] in our lives. So we pour out our praise.
[3:06:01] We pour out our praise.
[3:06:05] &gt;&gt; Don't you want to know our voice?
[3:06:09] So we pour out our praise to you.
[3:06:12] &gt;&gt; Don't you want this message that God has
[3:06:15] given us to drop from your head to your
[3:06:17] heart?
[3:06:18] &gt;&gt; Lord, let it become a part of you.
[3:06:24] &gt;&gt; No matter what's happening around me,
[3:06:26] &gt;&gt; bring light to the
[3:06:30] place of rest.
[3:06:35] &gt;&gt; Rest is a revelation. Every heart that
[3:06:39] is broken
[3:06:42] and great
[3:06:44] are great are you Lord.
[3:06:52] It's your breath
[3:06:55] in our lives. So we pour out our praise.
[3:07:00] Lord, we pour out our praises in your
[3:07:05] &gt;&gt; in our lungs. So we pour out our praise
[3:07:11] to you
[3:07:14] [Music]
[3:07:16] in our lives. So we pour out our praise.
[3:07:22] We pour out our praise. It's your breath
[3:07:27] in our lungs. So we pour out our praise
[3:07:32] to you.
[3:07:38] &gt;&gt; The misunderstandings
[3:07:42] can become an identity.
[3:07:47] You can begin to believe the report
[3:07:51] &gt;&gt; that others say about you.
[3:07:54] you can begin to believe the lie.
[3:07:58] The enemy will make sure that you hear
[3:08:00] it often enough
[3:08:02] that you'll begin to feel some
[3:08:04] connection with the false report of who
[3:08:06] you are and you'll lose your identity in
[3:08:10] Christ and you begin to be this messed
[3:08:12] up person. I hear people speaking of
[3:08:14] themselves that way. I'm messed up. I'm
[3:08:16] messed up. Um,
[3:08:21] I want to ask the Lord to give his bride
[3:08:23] in this house tonight. No matter where
[3:08:25] you're from and you're streaming the
[3:08:26] service, I want to ask the Lord to give
[3:08:28] you grace to break off
[3:08:32] every false report that the enemy has
[3:08:34] issued against your life.
[3:08:36] &gt;&gt; And the misunderstanding didn't come to
[3:08:39] make you bitter. It came to make you
[3:08:40] better.
[3:08:42] &gt;&gt; And the offense that came to your life,
[3:08:44] it didn't come to stay. It came to
[3:08:46] transform. It came to bring perfection.
[3:08:49] It came to tune you.
[3:08:52] The loss that you've known, the
[3:08:54] rejection that you've known, it didn't
[3:08:56] come to defeat you. It came to promote
[3:09:00] you.
[3:09:02] And somehow we've gotten caught up in
[3:09:05] the identity of what we have been
[3:09:07] through.
[3:09:09] And it's what we want to tell people
[3:09:11] when we come in contact with them. You
[3:09:13] just don't know what I've been through.
[3:09:16] The Lord wants to break that off of us
[3:09:21] &gt;&gt; so that we can be fully occupied by him.
[3:09:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:09:28] And begin to see ourselves as the word
[3:09:30] has seen us
[3:09:33] &gt;&gt; in his image.
[3:09:36] If you feel like you have agreed,
[3:09:40] you've come into agreement with some of
[3:09:42] the misunderstandings about your life,
[3:09:45] some of the lies, some of the attacks,
[3:09:47] some of the tales,
[3:09:50] if you feel like you've come into some
[3:09:52] agreement with that and you'd like for
[3:09:53] some grace to fall upon you to break
[3:09:56] that off this evening, let me see your
[3:09:58] hand if you understand what I'm saying.
[3:09:59] I'm not trying to talk mysteriously.
[3:10:03] Would you be willing to just put your
[3:10:04] hand over your head like that? I'm not
[3:10:07] trying to be crazy.
[3:10:10] May we just believe God right now to
[3:10:12] break off heavy bands.
[3:10:18] I know more than saw that. I mean, I
[3:10:20] know more than said that, but what I
[3:10:23] could see like iron bands
[3:10:26] &gt;&gt; around our heads
[3:10:29] representing
[3:10:31] the lies that we believed about
[3:10:33] ourselves and the false identities that
[3:10:36] we have taken on because of what we have
[3:10:38] been through. It's affecting us. It's
[3:10:40] impeding our spiritual growth. It's
[3:10:43] keeping us in a perpetual immaturity
[3:10:45] when we desire to grow up in Christ into
[3:10:48] the stature of the perfect man. So I
[3:10:51] pray right now I join my faith with the
[3:10:55] faith of this little people represented
[3:10:57] in this house tonight.
[3:11:00] We are not a product of what we've been
[3:11:02] through.
[3:11:04] &gt;&gt; We are not defined by what we have known
[3:11:07] by the misunderstandings that have
[3:11:09] surrounded our life. That is not who we
[3:11:12] are.
[3:11:14] &gt;&gt; And we ask you to come by the grace of
[3:11:17] God and break off every heavy band.
[3:11:22] &gt;&gt; That has tried to reidentify us as
[3:11:26] victims. When you are our victory,
[3:11:30] &gt;&gt; Jesus is the victor.
[3:11:33] &gt;&gt; You defeated death, hell, and the grave.
[3:11:37] &gt;&gt; You are my victory.
[3:11:39] You are my victory.
[3:11:42] And so we take authority by the word
[3:11:46] over everything the enemy has used to
[3:11:50] keep us in this vessel of
[3:11:52] misunderstanding
[3:11:54] so that we'll never be delivered from
[3:11:57] the things that need to be left behind.
[3:12:00] And we we launch forth into the goodness
[3:12:04] of God. We cast ourselves before the
[3:12:07] goodness of God and we say, "Move us,
[3:12:10] Lord.
[3:12:12] &gt;&gt; Move us into the identity of your word."
[3:12:16] &gt;&gt; May we confess over our lives what your
[3:12:20] word says about us. May we declare and
[3:12:24] decree over our lives what your word has
[3:12:28] said.
[3:12:31] Someone said today, "I'm losing my mind.
[3:12:35] It's a lie from the pit of hell.
[3:12:39] &gt;&gt; I would keep him in perfect peace whose
[3:12:43] mind is stayed on me.
[3:12:49] &gt;&gt; He's a liar and the father of all lies.
[3:12:57] It's not your mind you're losing.
[3:13:01] It's your false security.
[3:13:04] &gt;&gt; It's the things that you've found
[3:13:06] comfortable
[3:13:08] &gt;&gt; that God wants to move you past.
[3:13:14] &gt;&gt; I want to set you on a rock. His word
[3:13:16] said,
[3:13:18] &gt;&gt; I want to put a song in your mouth. Upon
[3:13:21] my rock. I want to give you a hiding
[3:13:24] place in the pavilion, in the
[3:13:25] tabernacle, in the refuge of the Lord.
[3:13:30] I want you to spend some time beneath
[3:13:32] the folds of my tent. That's what his
[3:13:34] word is saying to us.
[3:13:36] And the Lord knows I want it. And if
[3:13:39] you're some kind of strange uh thinker
[3:13:43] and you and you think I I don't I don't
[3:13:46] know how to relate to this kind of
[3:13:48] intimacy. I'm a man. I'm a man's man.
[3:13:51] I'm a masculine man. Let me tell you,
[3:13:54] one minute before his throne,
[3:13:57] one minute in the presence of the
[3:13:59] revealed Christ,
[3:14:02] &gt;&gt; and you'll quickly find the emotional
[3:14:04] side of who you are,
[3:14:06] &gt;&gt; undone before him.
[3:14:08] &gt;&gt; Men like to say things like, "Cry like a
[3:14:11] woman. Cry like a baby." You hear men
[3:14:12] saying that. That's exactly what you'll
[3:14:14] do if you ever get undone in his
[3:14:17] presence. You'll cry like a woman.
[3:14:18] You'll cry like a baby. Hallelujah.
[3:14:22] &gt;&gt; And let it bring a purging.
[3:14:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[3:14:29] &gt;&gt; By the time we reach this age in life,
[3:14:32] we shouldn't still be what we were
[3:14:34] raised to be. We should be more.
[3:14:37] My family, my family, my family, my
[3:14:40] parents, my family, my childhood, my
[3:14:43] upbringing, what I've been through. Oh,
[3:14:45] folks. Come on.
[3:14:47] &gt;&gt; You're a new creature.
[3:14:48] &gt;&gt; Come on. Behold, old things are passed
[3:14:51] away. Behold, all things have become
[3:14:53] new.
[3:14:56] &gt;&gt; You say, "I didn't know the love of an
[3:14:57] earthly father, nor did I. But I have
[3:15:00] known the love
[3:15:02] &gt;&gt; of a creator.
[3:15:04] &gt;&gt; I have known the love of an aba.
[3:15:06] &gt;&gt; I have known the love of a papa."
[3:15:09] &gt;&gt; There's no way in the world that a love
[3:15:11] could be produced on this earth that
[3:15:12] would begin to measure the love that he
[3:15:15] has loved us with.
[3:15:16] &gt;&gt; Find your identity in his love. Lord, I
[3:15:19] rest in the love of my papa. I rest in
[3:15:22] the love of my Abba, my creator, my
[3:15:25] king, my lord.
[3:15:30] &gt;&gt; Move me past my past.
[3:15:32] &gt;&gt; Say it with me. Move me past my past.
[3:15:36] &gt;&gt; Move me past my past.
[3:15:40] May I soar above
[3:15:43] &gt;&gt; what has sought to hold me back.
[3:15:48] Jesus,
[3:15:50] if you feel comfortable, take somebody
[3:15:52] near you if it's appropriate to do so.
[3:15:55] Take somebody near you by the hand.
[3:15:57] We're going to pray one more prayer,
[3:15:58] then worship just a bit and leave.
[3:16:03] We're have a nice meal, nice fellowship
[3:16:06] together.
[3:16:08] Church in the morning 11:00.
[3:16:11] Lord, I stand in agreement. I Here's one
[3:16:14] thing I know. The person next to me has
[3:16:18] been through stuff. Two, heartache two,
[3:16:23] misunderstanding,
[3:16:25] two, troubles, two, loss, rejection,
[3:16:29] pain,
[3:16:31] heartache two. I am not alone in this
[3:16:34] house.
[3:16:37] I'm surrounded by people who have felt
[3:16:40] the sting of life and its circumstances.
[3:16:46] And so, Lord, I'm at home with your
[3:16:48] people.
[3:16:51] Together, we have known what it's like
[3:16:54] to be earthbound
[3:16:56] by our circumstances.
[3:16:58] Tonight, we pray that you will let us
[3:17:00] know what it means to be heaven heaven
[3:17:03] bound,
[3:17:06] to soar above it all.
[3:17:08] You sent the anointing of a flying eagle
[3:17:12] to bring us out of the rest of the of
[3:17:14] the rest of Leodysia.
[3:17:17] May we come up above it in the anointing
[3:17:19] of a flying eagle who says, "I wasn't
[3:17:22] born to peck around in the circumstances
[3:17:25] and the carry on of yesterday." You've
[3:17:28] got fresh meat on the mountain. Just let
[3:17:30] me get back to the rock from where I was
[3:17:31] born. Let me get back to the rock of my
[3:17:34] birth. Let me get back to the high place
[3:17:36] you've called me to. In you. In you. Not
[3:17:39] a high place in pride. A high place in
[3:17:42] you.
[3:17:43] &gt;&gt; Woo.
[3:17:45] &gt;&gt; Where we're free. We stand holding hands
[3:17:48] because it's a point of contact. Let
[3:17:51] faith arise. Let victory arise in the
[3:17:53] heart of these brothers and sisters.
[3:17:55] Thank God for what you've done for us.
[3:17:57] Thank God for where you brought us from.
[3:18:00] Thank God for where you've taken us to.
[3:18:03] Oh hallelujah.
[3:18:06] &gt;&gt; Put a shout in our heart
[3:18:09] &gt;&gt; when we talk. Let us talk of your
[3:18:11] wonderful works. Let us talk of your
[3:18:13] precious revealed word. Let us see it
[3:18:16] like we've never seen it before until we
[3:18:19] demonstrate it in this wicked world
[3:18:20] around us.
[3:18:28] Spirit of God.
[3:18:31] We're not looking for emotion right now.
[3:18:33] We're looking for a shift
[3:18:36] in the deepest part of who we are. Put
[3:18:39] your finger, Lord, on the deepest part
[3:18:43] of who we are. Awaken the seed of
[3:18:45] destiny. Awaken the gene life of God.
[3:18:49] Whoa.
[3:18:52] &gt;&gt; Awaken that which you've planted in us
[3:18:55] &gt;&gt; for eternal purposes. Oh,
[3:18:59] &gt;&gt; we say come alive. Come alive in the
[3:19:03] authority of Jesus Christ. Come alive.
[3:19:06] Resurrection life.
[3:19:09] [Music]
[3:19:10] &gt;&gt; Resurrection life in his bride, in his
[3:19:14] wife. Resurrection
[3:19:17] life.
[3:19:27] I stood before the Lord one time many
[3:19:29] years ago in the spirit.
[3:19:31] &gt;&gt; I saw Mount Zion before me like a huge
[3:19:34] pyramid-shaped mountain. And I saw it in
[3:19:38] convulsions and contractions. And I
[3:19:41] didn't understand it. But the word of
[3:19:43] the Lord came and said, "Zion is having
[3:19:47] birth painans for the sons that are
[3:19:49] going to be born by the word." Born by
[3:19:53] the word. Born by the word. Hallelujah.
[3:19:58] You've known the contractions. You've
[3:20:00] known the squeeze. You've known the
[3:20:02] birth pains. It's time for sons to step
[3:20:06] forth in the authority
[3:20:10] of the king.
[3:20:15] [Music]
[3:20:17] &gt;&gt; How?
[3:20:18] [Music]
[3:20:23] There'll probably be more
[3:20:24] misunderstanding after this service,
[3:20:27] &gt;&gt; so brace yourself.
[3:20:29] &gt;&gt; Whoa.
[3:20:37] &gt;&gt; Let me lose myself and find myself in
[3:20:41] you.
[3:20:44] I'm sick and tired of being sick and
[3:20:46] tired.
[3:20:50] I'm tired of looking in the mirror and
[3:20:52] seeing myself.
[3:20:54] I'm ready to look in the mirror and see
[3:20:56] the man in the mirror.
[3:20:57] &gt;&gt; I'm ready to see the Christ looking back
[3:20:59] at me. That's the promise of the New
[3:21:01] Testament covenant.
[3:21:05] We are to become like what we look upon.
[3:21:08] We look upon your beauty tonight in
[3:21:10] faith. We see you as a beautiful savior.
[3:21:14] We see you as the only hope. We see you
[3:21:16] as the only God, the only true God, the
[3:21:20] only truth, the only absolute is found
[3:21:23] in you, not in sinful flesh. We gaze
[3:21:26] upon you to live. We see your goodness.
[3:21:29] We thank you for mercy who follows us.
[3:21:32] We thank you for goodness following us.
[3:21:35] Hallelujah. And we shake off. I I I hope
[3:21:38] you won't be embarrassed. But I hope
[3:21:40] somebody if you were willing to put your
[3:21:42] bands on your head, surely you'll just
[3:21:44] move your arms like this as an act of
[3:21:47] faith. That's all it is. There's no no
[3:21:49] trick in it. I'm not saying it's some
[3:21:50] magical motion. I'm just telling you
[3:21:52] just shake off.
[3:21:55] &gt;&gt; I just shake off those things by the
[3:21:57] spirit of God that bind me, that
[3:22:00] restrict me. I tell you, uh it's
[3:22:01] embarrassing sometimes.
[3:22:05] Amen.
[3:22:07] &gt;&gt; Just just think about those crazy people
[3:22:09] who scream and shout over the football
[3:22:11] game.
[3:22:13] &gt;&gt; They're not ashamed.
[3:22:15] &gt;&gt; You shouldn't be ashamed either. I I
[3:22:18] refuse that stuff. I just shake it off
[3:22:20] in the name of Jesus Christ. I I'm going
[3:22:23] to come out of this like him, like him,
[3:22:27] like his word.
[3:22:28] &gt;&gt; I don't want the sympathy of man.
[3:22:32] I want the comforter of the Holy Ghost.
[3:22:35] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[3:22:37] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[3:22:39] &gt;&gt; Sing again. It's what? Something that or
[3:22:42] something else.
[3:22:44] Little girl was lying there. The people
[3:22:48] are weeping.
[3:22:50] &gt;&gt; I want you to look at the brothers and
[3:22:51] sisters.
[3:22:54] &gt;&gt; God bless you. When he said she's only
[3:22:57] sleeping,
[3:22:58] &gt;&gt; shake a hand, hug a neck.
[3:23:00] &gt;&gt; As he took her by the hand,
[3:23:03] &gt;&gt; I'm in the
[3:23:04] &gt;&gt; she be to live again.
[3:23:08] Some be to praise the Lord. Some be to
[3:23:13] say
[3:23:15] [Music]
[3:23:18] that he's in the house.
[3:23:21] &gt;&gt; He's been here with us. Death has to
[3:23:24] flee.

[3:24:28] all our sins.
[3:24:31] &gt;&gt; So Jesus touched this heart of mine and
[3:24:35] he gave me life again.
[3:24:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm just a house of clay. But ever
[3:24:43] since that last blessing day, there's a

[3:28:43] Our
[3:28:55] father,
[3:28:58] we are so blessed to be in your
[3:28:59] presence.
[3:29:04] The word that we have heard tonight
[3:29:08] igniting some igniting something in us
[3:29:14] Lord, I worship you,
[3:29:23] [Music]
[3:29:24] Lord, as we fellowship together
[3:29:30] down in the fellowship hall.
[3:29:33] Would you let our fellowship be sweet,
[3:29:37] &gt;&gt; edifying,
[3:29:39] uplifting?
[3:29:42] Thank you for the food that has been
[3:29:44] provided. Would you sanctify it for our
[3:29:46] use?
[3:29:51] &gt;&gt; Lord, I pray for our pastor that you
[3:29:54] will renew him and strengthen him
[3:29:59] as we would rest on the bed tonight.
[3:30:02] God, refresh us that we may come back
[3:30:04] tomorrow
[3:30:06] to press in farther for what you have
[3:30:08] desired to speak to us this weekend.
[3:30:13] We bless you and honor you and give you
[3:30:15] praise
[3:30:17] in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus
[3:30:19] Christ.
[3:30:22] Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[3:30:28] You are invited to have fellowship with
[3:30:31] us down
[3:30:33] in the fellowship hall down under the
[3:30:36] hill.
[3:30:38] We've been very blessed as we came on
[3:30:40] the ground today that there was no red
[3:30:43] mud running across the parking lot.
[3:30:47] &gt;&gt; We'd like to keep it that way.
[3:30:50] So, we're asking that
[3:30:53] if you drive down to the bottom that you
[3:30:55] stay on the gravel.
[3:30:59] That means not even one wheel in the red
[3:31:01] mud because that stuff tracks and we
[3:31:05] don't want to track it and we don't want
[3:31:07] we we we don't want any stuck vehicles.
[3:31:10] So, it may be that some of us will have
[3:31:12] to walk down. So, be mindful of that.
[3:31:15] Please
[3:31:17] allow our seniors to be able to get down
[3:31:20] there.
[3:31:22] Perhaps carpool,
[3:31:25] our visitors, but we just want you to
[3:31:28] come and fellowship with you with us.
[3:31:30] There's plenty of food. The Lord bless
[3:31:33] you. Service in the morning at 11:00.
[3:31:40] So many times I've questioned
[3:31:44] C.
[3:31:45] circumstances
[3:31:48] and things I could not understand.
[3:31:52] [Music]
[3:31:55] &gt;&gt; And many times in trials,
[3:31:59] weakness blurs my vision. That's when my
[3:32:03] frustration gets so out of hand.
[3:32:10] But it's then I am reminded
[3:32:14] I've never been forsaken
[3:32:17] and I've never had to stand one test
[3:32:22] alone.
[3:32:24] That's when I look at all the victories
[3:32:29] and the spirit rises up in me. It's
[3:32:33] through the fire. My weaknesses are made
[3:32:37] strong.
[3:32:41] cuz he never promised that the cross
[3:32:44] would not get heavy and the hill would
[3:32:49] not be hard to
[3:32:52] climb.
[3:32:55] Cuz he never offered our victories
[3:33:00] without fighting. But he said help would
[3:33:03] always come in time.
[3:33:09] Just remember when you're standing in
[3:33:13] the valley of decision
[3:33:16] and the adversary
[3:33:18] says give in. Oh, just hold on
[3:33:26] cuz my Lord will show up. Yes. And he
[3:33:30] will take you through the fire again.
[3:33:39] I know within myself that I would surely
[3:33:43] perish. Oh, but if I trust the mighty
[3:33:47] hand of God, he'll shield the flames
[3:33:51] again.
[3:33:54] Oh,
[3:33:58] cuz he never promised that the cross
[3:34:02] would not get heavy and the hill would
[3:34:06] not be hard to climb. No,
[3:34:12] cuz he never offered our victories
[3:34:17] without fighting. But he said help would
[3:34:20] always come in time.
[3:34:26] Just remember when you're standing in
[3:34:30] your valley of decision and the
[3:34:34] adversaries says just give in. Just hold
[3:34:41] on.
[3:34:43] Cuz my Lord, he'll show up. Yes. And he
[3:34:47] will take you through the fire again.
[3:34:53] No.
[3:34:54] Oh, cuz he never promised that the cross
[3:34:59] would not get heavy and the hill would
[3:35:03] not be hard to climb.
[3:35:08] No.
[3:35:10] And he never offered one victory without
[3:35:15] fighting. But he said help would always
[3:35:18] come in time.
[3:35:23] Just remember when you're standing in
[3:35:27] your valley of decision and the
[3:35:31] adversaries
[3:35:33] says just give in. Just hold on.
[3:35:40] Oh my Lord it'll show up. Yes. said he
[3:35:45] will take you through the fire again.
[3:35:49] Sing it one last time. He never
[3:35:51] promised. No, he never promised. That
[3:35:56] the cross would not get heavy and the
[3:36:00] hill would not be hard to climb.
[3:36:05] No.
[3:36:07] And he never offered our victories
[3:36:11] without fighting. But he said hell would
[3:36:15] always come in time.
[3:36:21] Just remember when you're standing in
[3:36:24] your valley of decision and that old
[3:36:29] adversary says, "Why don't you just give
[3:36:33] in? Just hold on.
[3:36:38] Cuz my Lord will show up." Yes. And he
[3:36:42] will take you through the fire
[3:36:47] again.
[3:36:50] [Music]
[3:36:54] You're dismissed to go tonight.
