[4:08] resource of truth that i know would be a
[4:11] blessing in your life
[4:13] i didn't intend to give that as a
[4:15] commercial but it is a good idea for you
[4:18] to know what's available on our website
[4:21] revival.org we want to be a blessing to
[4:23] you and we realize that 30 minutes a
[4:26] week is not enough to be able to share
[4:29] with you
[4:30] many of the things that the lord has
[4:32] placed in our hearts to share so our
[4:35] website would be a great resource of
[4:38] information for you as well let's look
[4:40] to the word of god today we're studying
[4:43] birth pains we're talking about the end
[4:46] of time
[4:48] as we know it
[4:49] and we are counting down
[4:52] through 10
[4:53] of the major categories of birth pains
[4:58] that are specifically mentioned in the
[5:00] scripture last week we talked about
[5:02] number 10
[5:04] signs in the sun and the moon and the
[5:07] stars luke 21 25 jesus clearly tells us
[5:12] there will be signs in the sun in the
[5:14] moon and in the stars and upon the earth
[5:17] distress of nations with perplexity the
[5:19] sea and the waves roaring so uh we're
[5:22] talking about major weather pattern
[5:26] changes
[5:27] we're talking about uh increased
[5:31] uh
[5:32] signs in the heavens we we've been we've
[5:35] talked about the comets and the
[5:36] asteroids the meteors all of these kinds
[5:39] of things that are happening
[5:42] and some bringing devastation
[5:44] you know in times past it's just been
[5:46] the thought that these things could
[5:48] happen and now they're happening in
[5:50] reality and they're going to continue to
[5:52] happen and increase in frequency and
[5:55] intensity as we approach the coming of
[5:57] the lord we even talked about
[5:59] unidentified flying objects we mentioned
[6:02] at the uh
[6:03] in the broadcast last week that some of
[6:06] what people are saying there there are
[6:08] definitely natural explanations for for
[6:11] what they're seeing or what they're
[6:12] photographing
[6:14] but i also believe that people are
[6:17] observing both demonic activity and
[6:20] angelic activity that takes place
[6:23] between here
[6:24] and the second heaven uh between the
[6:27] earth's atmosphere and the second heaven
[6:31] and so people are seeing it
[6:33] they're they're appearances of some of
[6:35] this activity we really need the help of
[6:37] the holy spirit to be able to discern is
[6:40] this demonic activity i'm viewing or is
[6:42] this angelic activity that i that i have
[6:45] observed and of course some people have
[6:48] no grid for that so they're calling it
[6:50] flying saucers and life on mars and all
[6:53] kinds of other things
[6:55] uh but it's it's sometimes people
[6:58] dismiss it too quickly
[7:00] because there is some legitimacy to it
[7:02] it's part of
[7:04] the prophecy of our lord that there
[7:06] would be signs in the heavens
[7:08] and then
[7:10] we talked about number nine
[7:12] violence upon the whole earth luke 17 26
[7:16] as it was in the days of noah so shall
[7:18] it be in the days of the coming of the
[7:20] son of man and we read genesis 6 11 that
[7:23] describes for us
[7:26] as well as
[7:27] genesis 6 13.
[7:29] but genesis 6 11 said the earth also was
[7:32] corrupt before god and the earth was
[7:34] filled with violence and that's number
[7:36] nine violence escalating to the point
[7:40] that it is covering the whole earth
[7:43] we are seeing violence of such an
[7:47] unprecedented nature
[7:49] uh at least in our lifetime you know
[7:51] we're seeing things that that we never
[7:53] dreamed about we're talking about
[7:55] terrorism on a different level we're
[7:58] talking about uh
[8:00] i mean we're talking about nuclear
[8:02] warfare again
[8:03] we're talking about nations who who have
[8:06] either have the capability or
[8:09] are very close to having the capability
[8:11] to to launch weapons that would take out
[8:15] enormous numbers of people and there's
[8:18] going to be some
[8:20] some violence like that happen on planet
[8:23] earth
[8:24] what we must remember as children of god
[8:27] is that we cannot
[8:29] move and live in fear because the
[8:32] scripture is clear that fear brings
[8:35] torment and we can't live in that kind
[8:37] of fear you know i always remember what
[8:40] david said i'm an old man and i've never
[8:43] seen the righteous forsaken or his seed
[8:47] begging bread i truly believe you know
[8:51] call me naive if that's what you need to
[8:53] do but i truly believe that god is more
[8:58] than able to take care of his seed he is
[9:03] more than able to protect and to and to
[9:06] provide for
[9:08] his bride no matter what's happening in
[9:12] the world you see it's extremely dark
[9:15] out there but it's extremely bright in
[9:19] here because the bride of christ
[9:22] is being positioned and prepared and not
[9:26] only positioned and prepared we're being
[9:29] equipped
[9:30] we are learning by revelation the word
[9:33] of god
[9:34] we're learning how to deal with some of
[9:37] the issues of our heart
[9:39] we're learning how to quiet our souls
[9:42] so that we can
[9:44] live out of
[9:46] the realm of the spirit and our spirit
[9:49] has been regenerated and transformed by
[9:52] the very life of jesus christ so when we
[9:55] live out of our spirit we are living out
[9:58] of the life of jesus christ the organic
[10:03] life there is a there is an organic
[10:07] union that has taken place in our spirit
[10:09] man
[10:10] and that has
[10:12] brought to us the life of jesus christ
[10:16] zoe the eternal life of god and i i just
[10:19] believe if we lean on that and live out
[10:22] of that that we're going to be taken
[10:24] care of
[10:26] i think that we need to be wise i think
[10:28] that we need to consider
[10:30] making practical choices and decisions
[10:33] in our life i don't think that we need
[10:35] to tempt the lord i don't think that we
[10:37] need to be foolish in the way that we
[10:40] handle the end time but i think that we
[10:42] need not live in fear we need to live in
[10:47] confidence not self-confidence but but
[10:51] properly placed confidence what is that
[10:54] that is putting our hope and our trust
[10:58] and our confidence in the one who
[11:00] created us and not only created us but
[11:03] the one who made a way of redemption for
[11:05] us
[11:06] uh our eternal loving heavenly father he
[11:10] loved us so much that he took his spirit
[11:13] and placed it in
[11:15] a body that he created with specific
[11:19] specially designed creative redemptive
[11:22] blood
[11:23] and that blood was shed
[11:26] by our lord jesus christ yeshua the
[11:29] messiah who came to fulfill every jot
[11:33] and tittle of the passover
[11:35] promise
[11:36] he became our passover lamb shed his
[11:39] blood paid the price settled our sin
[11:42] dead
[11:43] we are being sanctified by the washing
[11:46] of the water of the word and we have the
[11:48] promise of being filled with the baptism
[11:52] of the holy ghost and fire somebody say
[11:55] fire we need the fire of god
[11:59] to fill us
[12:01] to consume us so that we can be
[12:04] transformed
[12:06] from this vile image to the very image
[12:09] and likeness of the one who loves us the
[12:11] most the one who created us for this
[12:13] specific purpose
[12:15] to arise and shine in the end time the
[12:18] bride of christ is going to arise and
[12:22] shine
[12:23] the church world the religious world is
[12:26] falling to apostasy but the bride of
[12:29] christ is going to arise
[12:32] and shine she's going to let the light
[12:36] of god
[12:37] emanate from within her
[12:39] she's going to point others to this way
[12:43] of hope this way of salvation
[12:46] so we're going to see
[12:48] violence increasing on the earth
[12:51] terrorism on a level i i shudder to say
[12:55] this on a level that we have not known
[12:59] it in the past and it has definitely
[13:01] increased over the past few years but
[13:04] unfortunately we're going to see it some
[13:06] more a new president a new prime
[13:09] minister a new dictator whatever the
[13:12] case is not going to solve the problems
[13:15] of the world the only hope for planet
[13:18] earth is to bow before her creator
[13:23] we're going to have to acknowledge the
[13:26] god of abraham isaac and jacob we're
[13:29] going to have to repent of our sins and
[13:31] take god's provided way
[13:34] of of salvation and in doing so if we
[13:37] could get enough people to come together
[13:40] and make that declaration we could see
[13:42] some changes but
[13:44] unfortunately there is going to be a
[13:46] harvest of souls but it it's not going
[13:48] to be the whole world every person on
[13:51] the planet turning to the lord like some
[13:54] have tried to make us i'd love that i
[13:56] mean that that works for me
[13:58] the problem is to teach that is giving
[14:01] false hope because the scripture does
[14:04] not tell us that every person in the
[14:06] world is going to be saved we have a
[14:08] choice to make and the truth is god
[14:12] already knows our choice before we ever
[14:14] make it in fact he knew our choice
[14:17] before we were ever born in fact he knew
[14:20] our choice before the foundation of the
[14:22] world
[14:24] we make the choice but god saw that
[14:27] choice in his foreknowledge and
[14:30] according to the foreknowledge that he
[14:32] had concerning us
[14:34] he
[14:35] predestinated us which means he gave us
[14:38] a pre-fixed destiny
[14:42] to those whom god did for no to them
[14:45] also he did predestinate and we have
[14:48] been predestinated to be conformed to
[14:51] his image to be changed from this old
[14:55] corruptable flesh we live in to a new
[14:57] and glorious body that's been created
[15:00] for us but also transformed on the
[15:03] inside our soul being redeemed and our
[15:07] spirit uh redeemed you know john g lake
[15:11] the great man of god
[15:14] uh taught uh this
[15:17] understanding of triune salvation
[15:19] salvation for the body for the soul and
[15:22] the spirit and i believe
[15:24] i mean it's simple the salvation of god
[15:26] is sufficient his grace is sufficient
[15:29] and he not only saves us so that we can
[15:32] you know be nice little church people
[15:34] but he changes us and transforms us so
[15:37] that we can be ambassadors of light so
[15:40] that we can keep covenant with god and
[15:43] so that we can speak deliverance to
[15:44] those around us i know every one of you
[15:47] watching this broadcast today no people
[15:50] not only do you know them some of you
[15:52] have loved ones who are bound by the
[15:55] power of satan and the power of sin and
[15:58] you want to be able to see them come to
[16:02] the knowledge not just the knowledge the
[16:04] saving knowledge
[16:06] and the saving reality of the lord jesus
[16:08] christ and i i join my faith with yours
[16:11] right now i believe we have every right
[16:13] to believe god for the salvation of our
[16:16] loved ones but i'm going to tell you
[16:18] what's going to have the biggest impact
[16:19] on our loved ones and our neighbors and
[16:22] that is when we are delivered you and i
[16:24] are delivered from hypocrisy when we
[16:27] come out of that place of
[16:29] of speaking one thing and living another
[16:32] when we are determined
[16:34] i guess i'm using my hands too much huh
[16:37] but uh so but i guess if i fold them
[16:40] like that maybe i won't use them for a
[16:42] few seconds but i i just get pretty
[16:45] intense when i talk about these kinds of
[16:48] things
[16:49] and
[16:50] i feel like sometime when i'm sitting
[16:52] here that that i'm just having a chat
[16:54] with you and uh i believe that's the
[16:57] anointing of the lord that makes that
[16:58] possible because i don't want to be
[17:00] preaching down at you i want to be
[17:02] encouraging you we want to see our loved
[17:05] ones saved we want to see them delivered
[17:07] we want to see them filled with the
[17:09] walking talking holy ghost
[17:11] and in order to do that i think we're
[17:13] going to have to to bring our lives
[17:17] in in alignment with what we say
[17:20] you know we're good at talking the talk
[17:22] now we need to be good at walking the
[17:24] walk
[17:26] i think that that spirit of hypocrisy
[17:28] and compromise has has certainly kept a
[17:31] lot of precious people away from the
[17:34] saving reality of jesus christ so you
[17:37] and i need to do something about that we
[17:39] need to draw up to the lord as close as
[17:42] we can possibly get we need to be able
[17:44] to lay our head over on his chest and
[17:47] hear his heart beat and know what he
[17:49] cares for what he loves what he's
[17:51] passionate about i want to discover what
[17:54] breaks his heart what disappoints him
[17:58] i want to be able to know him in that
[18:00] intimate way so that i can better live
[18:04] to serve him it's time for the bride of
[18:07] christ to rise up and and serve god not
[18:11] only in word but indeed
[18:14] because
[18:16] these birth pains are going to continue
[18:18] as i've said over and over they're going
[18:20] to increase in intensity and frequency
[18:23] and we're going to have to shine we're
[18:25] going to have to help pick up the pieces
[18:28] of of broken lives and devastated
[18:31] nations and cities that are going to be
[18:34] shaken by the power of god which brings
[18:37] us to number eight on our backward
[18:39] countdown
[18:41] jesus said there's going to be famines
[18:45] pestilences
[18:46] and earthquakes
[18:48] like never before
[18:50] the scripture tells us in in matthew 24
[18:53] and 7 for nations shall rise against
[18:55] nation and kingdom against kingdom and
[18:58] there shall be famines
[19:01] and pestilences and earthquakes in
[19:03] divers places and in luke chapter 21
[19:06] verse 11 he said and great earthquakes
[19:09] shall be in diverse places and famines
[19:12] and pestilences and fearful sights and
[19:15] great signs shall there be from heaven
[19:19] so
[19:20] all of these diff birth pains
[19:23] that have indicated the beginning of
[19:26] sorrows
[19:27] the beginning of travail
[19:29] are now
[19:31] moving faster
[19:33] and increasing
[19:35] and so we have to prepare ourselves i
[19:37] mean earthquakes have been happening
[19:38] forever the earth has been shaking the
[19:41] plates have been shifting
[19:43] but
[19:45] we
[19:45] can see by careful research that there
[19:49] has already been an intensity a change
[19:52] in intensity and frequency
[19:55] um i noticed that that
[19:58] the usgs the united states geological uh
[20:02] society or or whatever
[20:04] they are averaging
[20:07] the earthquakes and and by doing that
[20:10] they averaged the frequency since 1900
[20:13] and by averaging them that way uh from
[20:16] 1900 until 2010
[20:20] it doesn't really show us
[20:23] an accurate
[20:25] concept of the
[20:28] change in frequency and intensity the
[20:30] trend
[20:31] it has to be done in a different way it
[20:34] has to be broken up
[20:36] and an easy way of doing that is
[20:38] breaking it up in decades do you follow
[20:40] what i'm saying if you if you take a
[20:42] hundred years and you average every
[20:44] earthquake that's happened in 100 years
[20:47] it pulls the frequency and intensity
[20:50] down
[20:50] but if you divide the the number of
[20:54] earthquakes
[20:55] in the world into decades and you look
[20:58] at them by average you've got a
[21:00] different picture you're seeing
[21:02] something and i've i've uh i have that
[21:04] research here and i can share that with
[21:06] you we're talking
[21:08] only right now about earthquakes 8.0 and
[21:12] above we're talking about major
[21:14] rumblings okay so from 50 from 1950 to
[21:19] 1959
[21:21] there were only three earthquakes in the
[21:23] world
[21:25] 8.0 or greater from 1960 to 69 only
[21:29] three
[21:30] 8.0 or greater 70 to 79 only three
[21:35] 8.0 or greater 80 to 89 there was a
[21:39] change there were four that year 8.0 or
[21:42] greater 90 to 99 there were six
[21:46] six earthquakes 8.0 or greater and then
[21:50] from 2000 until 2009 there were 13.
[21:55] so we've gone from three a decade now to
[21:58] 13 or more in a single decade that was
[22:01] from 2000 to 2009
[22:04] and now we're in a new decade
[22:07] and we're seeing
[22:09] frequency and intensity increase now
[22:12] look at deaths for instance quickly i'm
[22:15] going to give you the total number of
[22:17] deaths
[22:18] in a decade from earthquakes from 80 to
[22:22] 89 there were 58
[22:24] 880 deaths in that decade
[22:28] in from 90 to 99 it nearly doubled 114
[22:35] 646 from 2000 to
[22:38] 2009 there were 471
[22:43] 000
[22:44] and 12
[22:46] deaths
[22:47] so we're not talk
[22:48] did you see that jump
[22:50] for in the 80s there were 58 000 in the
[22:53] 90s 114 000 and from 2000 to 2009 471
[23:01] 000. look at this in 2010
[23:05] there were 226
[23:09] 729 in one year
[23:13] 226 000. in one year of this decade that
[23:17] we're living in now there have already
[23:19] been 200 and i don't have the
[23:22] information uh for 2011 12 and now we've
[23:26] entered into 2013 but it's certainly not
[23:30] likely that we're going to see less
[23:32] earthquakes of 8.0 and greater and it's
[23:36] certainly not likely that we're going to
[23:38] see less deaths as these earthquakes
[23:41] increase in frequency and intensity the
[23:44] number of casualties is going to
[23:47] increase
[23:48] why because the earth is in birth pains
[23:53] you know people say uh oh it's the
[23:56] judgment of god god is judging the earth
[23:58] listen you can you can look at it any
[24:00] way you want to i mean you can call it
[24:03] judgment if you like but is it really
[24:05] judgment if you warn people ahead of
[24:08] time and tell them this is how it's
[24:10] going to be in the end time you need to
[24:12] consider your ways
[24:14] and then when it begins to happen 2 000
[24:17] years later like jesus prophesied it
[24:20] then we all rise up and say well it's
[24:22] the judgment of god now i'm not going to
[24:24] say that it doesn't pertain to his
[24:26] judgment it's but it's really the
[24:28] purging of the earth it's the purifying
[24:31] of the earth it's the earth in birth
[24:34] pains
[24:35] squeezing something contracting so that
[24:39] something can come forth of greater
[24:41] glory
[24:42] and the greater glory is
[24:45] the kingdom of god
[24:48] this earth as we know it has to give way
[24:52] for the coming kingdom of god and so the
[24:56] signs of the nearness of the coming of
[25:00] the kingdom of god are these birth pains
[25:02] part of which are earthquakes and so
[25:06] we're going to see them they're going to
[25:07] not only shake the places that are
[25:10] familiar in fact i had a word a couple
[25:11] years ago where the lord said i'm going
[25:13] to clearly allow earthquakes to come
[25:17] into the places where people expect them
[25:20] but i'm going to show my power
[25:23] in my strength in places where people
[25:26] have not expected earthquakes to come so
[25:30] it sounds to me like we're going to see
[25:32] a baffling of science that we're going
[25:34] to see a scientific knowledge in theory
[25:38] even tested in the end time the bible
[25:40] said
[25:41] the scripture tells us that god is going
[25:43] to shake everything that can be shaken
[25:47] to determine what is strong enough to
[25:50] remain i tell you the bride of christ is
[25:53] going to withstand the shaking of planet
[25:56] earth we're going to stand we're going
[25:59] to remain and we're going to bring forth
[26:01] the fruits of righteousness
[26:04] i'm not saying that that righteous
[26:06] people won't die in these things that
[26:08] happen in the earth i'm not saying that
[26:09] at all i'm telling you in all likelihood
[26:12] they have and they will but not without
[26:15] warning
[26:16] and remember that precious in the sight
[26:19] of the lord is the is the death of his
[26:21] saints
[26:22] if if we are taken out of here by by
[26:25] some tragedy or some uh some natural
[26:29] calamity or disaster my to be
[26:32] uh to to to be absent from this body is
[26:35] to be present with the lord i'm ready i
[26:38] want to stay ready i want to stay packed
[26:41] up paid up and ready to go
[26:43] and we need to do that we need to be
[26:45] aware of the things that are going on
[26:47] listen i get on the airplane all the
[26:48] time i'm aware of the fact that airplane
[26:50] may not always stay where it's supposed
[26:52] to stay i hope it does i don't believe
[26:55] i'm going to die one second before the
[26:58] lord is through with me and i don't
[26:59] believe you are either
[27:01] but i'd like to stick around as long as
[27:03] i possibly can i just i just love
[27:06] serving the lord i love god's people i
[27:09] love taking the message of truth to the
[27:11] nations of the world by christian
[27:13] television
[27:14] but if if you hear the news one of these
[27:17] days that i'm gone by by natural death a
[27:20] problem in my body or some tragedy
[27:23] you can know because i can know i know
[27:27] that every sin is covered by the blood
[27:29] of jesus i am not a perfect person i
[27:31] make mistakes i fail the lord but i know
[27:34] what to do about it
[27:36] i know how to call on him and he shows
[27:39] and extends his grace and he forgives me
[27:42] and i walk in a in a place of redemption
[27:45] and wholeness and you can too
[27:48] i want to pray for you right now father
[27:51] be with those who are watching this
[27:52] broadcast release your revelation truth
[27:55] into their lives
[27:57] lord let your promises come alive in our
[28:00] hearts in the wonderful name of yeshua
[28:03] our messiah thank you for watching the
[28:05] eagles cry my time is gone but i hope
[28:08] you'll tune in again i have a whole lot
[28:10] more on my heart that i want to share
[28:12] with you bye bye for now
