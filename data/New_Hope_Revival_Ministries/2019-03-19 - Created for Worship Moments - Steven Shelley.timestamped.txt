[0:00] until there was worship he was
[0:02] potentially God with no one to adorn him
[0:05] as God don't misunderstand
[0:23] so you tell me
[0:24] his worship important until there was
[0:29] worship he was potentially God with no
[0:32] one to adore him as God
[0:35] don't misunderstand he was God in all of
[0:38] his goodness all his power all his
[0:40] authority everything that God is he was
[0:43] then but there was no one no thing
[0:46] nothing yet
[0:47] to acknowledge him as God so he was
[0:50] potentially God but by definition not
[0:53] yet God but when he created some things
[0:56] to worship Him he then fulfilled what he
[1:01] was only in the potential now he is
[1:04] totally and completely God and what made
[1:07] the difference in him being potentially
[1:10] God by definition and fully God in
[1:13] reality worship worship made the
[1:18] difference now you tell me how important
[1:21] worship is worship is the difference
[1:25] between God being potentially God with
[1:27] no one to worship Him and someone
[1:32] created for the purpose most of you have
[1:36] no problem believing that angels were
[1:38] created to worship God but you've not
[1:41] yet explored the idea that you were
[1:43] created you you were created you who are
[1:47] identified as a part of the Bride of
[1:50] Christ you are just as much created to
[1:53] worship God as any angel as for living
[1:58] creatures as any of the heavenly hosts
[2:01] in its Sharia beam any a seraphim any of
[2:05] the Archangels all created to worship
[2:07] God but you are part of the original
[2:09] thoughts of God you were also created
[2:12] for that purpose to demonstrate all that
[2:14] is in God you and I have a
[2:17] responsibility to demonstrate all that
[2:21] was in God
[2:22] from the beginning and we can only do
[2:24] that by the true baptism of the Holy
[2:26] Ghost
[2:26] I want you to know we need the Holy
[2:28] Ghost if you believe that do better with
[2:30] your amen
[2:31] we need the Holy Ghost we need to be
[2:34] filled with the Holy Ghost we need to be
[2:37] baptized with the Holy Ghost we need to
[2:40] be submerged in the Holy Ghost one
[2:43] baptism the Prophet said and Minnie
[2:47] somebody say many many refilling
