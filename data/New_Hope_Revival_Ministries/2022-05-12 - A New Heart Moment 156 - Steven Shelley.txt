Description:
Jesus stepped into a body of human flesh to present Himself as the spotless Lamb.  He attained what no human being could attain.  He took away our stony heart and replaced it with a heart of flesh, so His Word could be written within us, never to be taken from us.  That Word inscribed within us is become a very part of our life.  No one can rob us of the Living Word within us.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
now why did he give you a heart of flesh [Music] now when moses came down off of the mountain what did he have he had two stone tablets hard stone tablets that god had written on now we know that when he came down off the mountain and there was a noise of war in the camp and he says what is going on and and and he ended up breaking those stones but on that was the commandments of the lord and god wrote them on that but god knew that man could never keep that commandment of the lord as long as their heart was as hard as the stone tables that the original commandments were written on he knew that when man was hard-hearted that he could never receive the seed word of god so he had to take our heart and make it a heart of flesh something that could be written upon he knew that all of those commandments that he gave to those people he knew that the people could never fully 100 percent obey them he knew it what he gave him because he knew that it was only the shadow of what was to come his purpose his plan was not for people to try within themselves to be good enough to present themselves before a living god because he knew it was impossible because the endemic nature was still in them but he knew that there was coming that uh that perfect one that he was going to step into the body of human flesh and he was going to present himself as the spotless lamb the lamb that was slain from before the foundation of the world and all of those things that could not be kept by the human race all of those things that looked too hard to attain he did he did and because he did i did who do you think you are i'm in him that's all i know to tell you i'm in him he he did it and he beckoned me to come and be a part of that final work of the spirit of god in in the human race and he wanted me to be so much apart till he made a way for me to get to him and he says i'm going to take that stony heart out of your flesh and i'm going to give you a heart of flesh now why did he give you a heart of flesh god wanted it to be so written right down here until that there was no way that we could ever get away from it if if we forgot our bible somewhere or if we were in a position and maybe in a prison somewhere where they wouldn't let a bible come to you the word of god already inscribed on the inside and it doesn't matter whether they take your bible away from you it doesn't matter what they take away from you because god did not give you a stone tablet that you needed to carry everywhere but he gave you a heart of flesh a fleshly table of the heart and he's inscribing his word on that so that it is a very part of your life
