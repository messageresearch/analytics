[1:01:20] so thankful for you praying for us for
[1:01:23] our family God has certainly been with
[1:01:26] us
[1:01:27] through the course of the last three
[1:01:30] weeks when we left you three weeks ago
[1:01:33] we did not know what awaited US
[1:01:37] when you were hearing a sermon here two
[1:01:40] weeks ago about a changing season
[1:01:43] how little did I know
[1:01:45] how much a season was about to change
[1:01:48] but God is perfect in all of his ways
[1:01:53] when I tried to get an airplane ticket
[1:01:54] so that I didn't have to drive all those
[1:01:56] miles
[1:01:58] and found that the rental cars were more
[1:02:00] than I wanted to pay so I drove god is
[1:02:03] perfect in all his ways he knew that
[1:02:06] there was something on the other end
[1:02:08] there that I needed to be there for so I
[1:02:11] drove
[1:02:12] was it easy
[1:02:14] not not really especially coming back
[1:02:16] home when it rained all day long and was
[1:02:19] foggy but God saw us through and he's
[1:02:22] faithful in all of his ways
[1:02:25] and I'm so grateful to be here today and
[1:02:28] report to you we saw God work all the
[1:02:31] way through and the the hours getting
[1:02:34] away from us so I won't take time maybe
[1:02:36] Tuesday night I'll share a little bit
[1:02:37] with you but I just want you to know we
[1:02:40] saw God work all along the way and I'm
[1:02:44] so grateful he is good he is good he is
[1:02:48] good well it was announced that the
[1:02:51] first Sunday receiving the principal
[1:02:53] offering would be moved to this Sunday
[1:02:55] so we're if you brought that with you we
[1:02:58] are going to receive that now as of to
[1:03:01] as of today there has been 250
[1:03:05] 043 dollars
[1:03:08] and 67 cents two five zero zero four
[1:03:12] three and 67 cents has been given toward
[1:03:15] this that means that the balance now
[1:03:18] stands at 219 353 dollars and 39 cents I
[1:03:24] Rejoice over this
[1:03:26] I Rejoice over that
[1:03:29] [Applause]
[1:03:36] and I would like for it to be all gone
[1:03:38] right now today
[1:03:40] but I noticed something this week and I
[1:03:42] realized that God is perfect in all of
[1:03:46] his ways
[1:03:48] you remember when he told the children
[1:03:50] of Israel I'm going to give you the land
[1:03:52] little by little
[1:03:54] because you would not be able to inhabit
[1:03:56] all of it if I gave it to you all at
[1:03:58] once
[1:03:59] and I I saw something this week that God
[1:04:03] gave to us several years ago that's not
[1:04:06] maintained
[1:04:07] and it's very ugly
[1:04:09] I'm not even going to tell you what it
[1:04:10] is it's just something I saw on this
[1:04:13] ground that God gave to us and it was
[1:04:16] beautiful then but we didn't maintain it
[1:04:21] jealous
[1:04:23] and so this is why God has to do things
[1:04:25] this way little by little
[1:04:28] because as he adds to us and we can
[1:04:30] maintain the land that he gives us
[1:04:33] then we will see him do what he said he
[1:04:37] would do he's given us the land and we
[1:04:40] want to maintain it we want to be
[1:04:41] faithful but we get all caught up in our
[1:04:44] own stuff
[1:04:46] I get all caught up in my own stuff I'm
[1:04:48] not I'm not going to put it all on you
[1:04:50] get it all caught up in my own stuff and
[1:04:52] we let God's stuff go
[1:04:54] and so then it becomes ugly but God
[1:04:57] wants us to maintain what he gives us
[1:04:59] first in the spirit
[1:05:02] in the spirit man we've got to maintain
[1:05:05] what he gives us if we don't then the
[1:05:08] devil will come along with his seeds of
[1:05:10] doubt and weeds will grow up and and
[1:05:14] trees will die and stuff doesn't get
[1:05:17] watered you know this kind of stuff but
[1:05:19] God he allows us to go through those
[1:05:22] Seasons but then he comes back along and
[1:05:24] he says I want you to maintain this I
[1:05:27] want you to maintain this that's what I
[1:05:28] see right here little by little the Lord
[1:05:30] is letting us take care of this debt so
[1:05:32] if you brought with you your offering
[1:05:34] today I want to give you opportunity to
[1:05:37] bring it and give to the Lord I'm going
[1:05:39] to ask Ian if he'll come and hold the
[1:05:41] offering bag this morning and that we
[1:05:43] will give unto the Lord what he has
[1:05:47] asked of us the tithe belongs to him
[1:05:50] this is our offering this is above our
[1:05:53] tithe we give with a grateful heart
[1:05:56] because he has blessed us if you brought
[1:05:59] it with you today I want you to hold it
[1:06:01] in your hand I'm going to ask the Lord
[1:06:03] for his Blessing on it and ask the Lord
[1:06:05] to multiply it father you you saw every
[1:06:10] person that brought their tithe and Lord
[1:06:13] I don't want to forget those that give
[1:06:15] online and they give in uh on the app
[1:06:18] and Lord they give and we bless them we
[1:06:22] bless each one that gives of their tithe
[1:06:25] and their offering for the purposes of
[1:06:27] the kingdom and Lord as we have brought
[1:06:30] this offering for the principle of the
[1:06:32] mortgage of this property and Lord I

[1:06:36] airwaves it there will be people who
[1:06:38] will give online so we bless them all
[1:06:41] together right now and ask God that as
[1:06:44] these seeds are planted that there would

[1:06:53] belong to us o God we honor you and give

[1:12:34] she's been through a lot and sister Jaya
[1:12:37] has got a big responsibility on her it's
[1:12:40] a long way to go down and come back and
[1:12:43] go down and we want to pray for her plus
[1:12:45] she has a job
[1:12:47] have you quit your job they're just
[1:12:49] letting you go now for now or how is
[1:12:51] that working
[1:12:54] oh how wonderful in that wonderful her
[1:12:57] job is letting her work virtually let's
[1:12:59] thank God for that
[1:13:01] because she has to have an income
[1:13:06] and we're thankful and then I also had a
[1:13:08] prayer request come in here from our
[1:13:11] friends the Gillards in uh UK and
[1:13:14] brother Stewart is having an operation
[1:13:16] this Friday and we want to believe that
[1:13:19] God will touch him and guide the
[1:13:21] doctor's hands and work miracles on his
[1:13:25] behalf and uh I I think they are up in
[1:13:28] years and they need the help of the lord
[1:13:31] well he's a helper I want to ask you all
[1:13:34] a question I want to give this little
[1:13:36] testimony for the glory of God because
[1:13:38] there's no distance in prayer and when
[1:13:41] everyone is praying we never know whose
[1:13:44] prayer has touched the Lord
[1:13:46] I like that
[1:13:48] I've met people that didn't appreciate
[1:13:50] God's system
[1:13:52] because they didn't get to take credit
[1:13:55] these are not the tent days
[1:13:58] where people lured people into their
[1:14:01] tents by the biggest testimonies that's
[1:14:04] not we're we're not in competition
[1:14:06] anymore because God doesn't send
[1:14:09] miracles to vindicate men
[1:14:11] he didn't mend he didn't vindicate
[1:14:13] brother Branham with miracles
[1:14:17] he Vindicated the word
[1:14:19] that's what he comes to confirm and to
[1:14:22] vindicate and to say Amen to but how
[1:14:25] many of you remember the little sister
[1:14:26] that was here the weekend before we
[1:14:28] celebrated Thanksgiving Sunday this
[1:14:31] couple had come all the way from Oregon
[1:14:33] for our camp meeting and uh before they
[1:14:37] went back from is it Arkansas before
[1:14:40] they went back from Arkansas to Oregon
[1:14:42] uh his mother 90 years old wanted to
[1:14:46] come and she wanted to be in a service
[1:14:48] with us and she was prayed for here she
[1:14:51] worshiped the Lord they had lunch with
[1:14:53] us and God did touch her he absolutely
[1:14:56] did touch her how many of you remember
[1:14:58] the sister I mentioned it to some and
[1:15:00] they didn't remember but you remember
[1:15:02] her well God touched her and pray people
[1:15:06] were praying I want you to know that
[1:15:08] people were praying everywhere for her
[1:15:10] and we give God the praise but she has
[1:15:13] cancer had gone into her bones is what I
[1:15:16] am told and her last six-month scan
[1:15:20] showed it growing
[1:15:22] some and had gone into the neck it was
[1:15:26] already I think in the shoulder and you
[1:15:29] know bone cancer is one of the most
[1:15:31] painful cancers and of course she was
[1:15:34] under doctor's care and they they always
[1:15:37] like to step in and take some kind look
[1:15:40] folk can I just tell you this if doctors
[1:15:43] could heal if doctors could heal cancer
[1:15:47] they could cure it
[1:15:51] do you understand if they could heal it
[1:15:55] they could stop it
[1:15:56] but they can't they can do everything
[1:15:58] that they know to do but only God can
[1:16:01] heal it now if you believe this message
[1:16:03] you believe it's a spirit
[1:16:06] brother random said it was and it has
[1:16:07] life in it well scientists tells us it
[1:16:11] has life in it well I want you to know
[1:16:13] she went back to the doctor this week
[1:16:15] for another scan and there was no trace
[1:16:18] of that cancer whatsoever God be praised
[1:16:23] best Praise Him for her Lord we praise
[1:16:26] you for our little sister on her behalf
[1:16:30] we celebrate your goodness we celebrate
[1:16:34] who you are
[1:16:36] hallelujah
[1:16:39] oh did God be the glory
[1:16:43] to God in the glory to God be the glory
[1:16:47] are Yeshua our Salvation thank you Lord
[1:16:53] thank you Lord for touching her body and
[1:16:56] healing her
[1:16:57] thank you Jesus now that's a good
[1:17:00] testimony
[1:17:02] we haven't heard of even heard hardly of
[1:17:05] testimonies like that in a long time
[1:17:07] bone cancer
[1:17:09] but God is a big God
[1:17:12] and all I know is this her faith
[1:17:16] I don't know what moment it happened but
[1:17:19] her faith made her whole
[1:17:23] her faith made her whole all I know is
[1:17:26] this my testimony to the family was this
[1:17:28] when I stood before her I had not sensed
[1:17:32] such faith in a long time
[1:17:35] I saw her like my little great
[1:17:37] grandmother I don't know why all of a
[1:17:40] sudden it was like she was my little
[1:17:42] great grandmother who wore a little
[1:17:43] bonnet who prayed who God moved for so
[1:17:47] many times and it was just like the Lord
[1:17:50] said you know I felt this I felt this
[1:17:52] her faith I felt her faith
[1:17:56] she asked for everybody's prayers but
[1:18:00] her faith
[1:18:01] many times perhaps Through The Years
[1:18:04] touched the Lord and she had wholeness
[1:18:07] and healing because of him we are
[1:18:10] programmed quite quite wrong in this
[1:18:13] hour and we hear a testimony like that
[1:18:16] we can hardly you did a wonderful job
[1:18:18] rejoicing but most of the time reasoning
[1:18:21] starts kicking in we can hardly rejoice
[1:18:24] somebody says what if it come back what
[1:18:26] if this what is that what what if the
[1:18:27] other what
[1:18:30] my
[1:18:32] my can you imagine
[1:18:34] why they're gonna they're gonna take
[1:18:36] whatever treatment she was getting
[1:18:37] whatever medications she was getting
[1:18:39] they're gonna they're gonna want
[1:18:41] everybody to have it
[1:18:44] and they're gonna find out
[1:18:46] and it's not going to be what they'd
[1:18:48] like for it to be
[1:18:49] it was her faith that touched the Lord
[1:18:51] never seen like Jesus said such great
[1:18:54] faith not in Israel here's a mother of
[1:18:56] Israel and she has touched the Lord and
[1:19:00] the Lord has proven himself again to be
[1:19:03] who he says he is so for me this morning
[1:19:06] I have no doubt of who he is I believe
[1:19:09] in how many of you believe him I believe
[1:19:12] him
[1:19:13] he confirms his word to us again and
[1:19:17] again and again now I have one little
[1:19:20] order of business that we need to take
[1:19:22] care of this morning before we bring the
[1:19:24] word and that is uh I would like to ask
[1:19:29] who is in a position you're not working
[1:19:34] late and you could do this if you can't
[1:19:37] I want to know it because I'm gonna I'm
[1:19:40] gonna let brother Benham said the
[1:19:42] majority the will of the majority is the
[1:19:45] will of God
[1:19:49] that's in church affairs
[1:19:52] we're going to claim it for church
[1:19:53] elections and church Affairs and I'm not
[1:19:56] running any church elections here
[1:19:58] but what I'd like to do is I want to uh
[1:20:02] bring a message to you and uh not this
[1:20:06] morning but I'd like to bring a message
[1:20:08] to you next weekend I can do it one of
[1:20:11] two ways we can have a service on
[1:20:14] Saturday night for those of you who are
[1:20:17] not working late and who could be here
[1:20:19] or those of you who could drag in after
[1:20:22] work and be here or we can do it Sunday
[1:20:24] morning we're going to have a Sunday
[1:20:26] morning service regardless but it might
[1:20:29] be that the subject matter would be such
[1:20:32] that it might serve a better atmosphere
[1:20:35] for for a special meeting for a Saturday
[1:20:37] night and I don't want you to feel great
[1:20:41] pressure from me but I just want to know
[1:20:44] what what you have going on and if it's
[1:20:48] something you can change uh change it if
[1:20:51] it's your job your job is how you pay
[1:20:54] your bills and it's how you pay your
[1:20:57] tithe
[1:20:58] and it's how we keep moving
[1:21:01] and several have asked about tithing if
[1:21:04] you will please put your tithing in an
[1:21:06] envelope and Market tithe because that's
[1:21:09] the only way that it's handled properly
[1:21:11] here is if you put it in an envelope and
[1:21:14] Mark it as tithe you don't even have to
[1:21:16] put your name on it if you don't want
[1:21:18] credit for it it's not your name it's
[1:21:20] not what we need but we need to know
[1:21:22] what it's designated for and someone
[1:21:24] asked me this week I thought I thought
[1:21:27] we had kind of made that but you know
[1:21:29] people forget and sometimes they're not
[1:21:31] here and they don't hear
[1:21:32] but uh I want to ask who would be able
[1:21:36] to join us next Saturday night at about
[1:21:40] six o'clock for an extra service let me
[1:21:42] see your hand
[1:21:44] all right now let me catch the hands of
[1:21:46] those who would not be able to sister
[1:21:49] Anna were you were the first person that
[1:21:51] actually popped in my mind where you'll
[1:21:53] be working she's supposed to be working
[1:21:55] next Saturday night anybody else could
[1:21:58] not be here uh Bethany and and Rachel
[1:22:01] you're working Bethany and and Rachel
[1:22:03] Morgan anybody up here
[1:22:06] because we have to have some all right
[1:22:07] let's let's meet here Saturday night at
[1:22:11] six o'clock
[1:22:12] and of course we will record and we will
[1:22:17] archive and we will let you know Tuesday
[1:22:20] night about streaming but we most likely
[1:22:23] will stream
[1:22:25] we will have uh about 30 minutes of
[1:22:28] worship and get right into it so that we
[1:22:31] can kind of finish that night it would
[1:22:33] be great that we didn't have to carry it
[1:22:35] over to to Sunday morning anybody
[1:22:39] curious
[1:22:43] I'm not a betting man
[1:22:46] but I've got a feeling some of you
[1:22:47] already know
[1:22:50] I'm going to be speaking next Saturday
[1:22:52] night on the subject why my family does
[1:22:55] not celebrate Christmas and I would like
[1:22:58] for you to come and be here there are so
[1:23:00] many questions that people have and this
[1:23:03] would be a great time to answer as many
[1:23:05] of those questions as we possibly can
[1:23:07] and as a church body we have held to
[1:23:11] that because we believe that's what the
[1:23:13] prophet taught
[1:23:14] we're not trying to be different we're
[1:23:17] not trying to steal people's fun we try
[1:23:21] to do other things to celebrate and to
[1:23:25] enjoy one another's company and to have
[1:23:27] fun but we just believe I I just believe
[1:23:31] that if you take everything watch it get
[1:23:33] tight here
[1:23:36] how will we make it till Saturday night
[1:23:40] if we take everything the word said
[1:23:44] and everything history says and
[1:23:47] everything the prophet said all of it
[1:23:51] all of it and we hold it up together we
[1:23:55] believe that I believe with all my heart
[1:23:57] that the evidence it we is is so stacked
[1:24:01] against us having hardly any part of it
[1:24:05] now there are things that we can do
[1:24:07] family is family
[1:24:10] and and there's no harm in loving our
[1:24:13] family and being with our family I can't
[1:24:16] imagine anyone enjoying going off
[1:24:19] somewhere and watching someone celebrate
[1:24:22] Christmas
[1:24:24] I don't understand the thought of that
[1:24:26] but I understand family
[1:24:29] and I understand wanting to be to see
[1:24:31] how quiet it is
[1:24:33] I understand people wanting to be
[1:24:35] together and I of all the things I
[1:24:37] understand I understand food
[1:24:43] I have no prejudice against the turkey
[1:24:46] I like him I only see him about twice a
[1:24:48] year but I have no problem with the
[1:24:50] turkey
[1:24:51] but I what I have a problem with is the
[1:24:55] gray backsliding
[1:24:57] now some people say well my family for
[1:25:00] 50 years has celebrated Christmas all
[1:25:02] right you were if that's the case and
[1:25:04] you've been in this message for 50 years
[1:25:07] someone has and their family has
[1:25:09] celebrated you are the you are a rare
[1:25:11] rare jewelry because when I heard this
[1:25:15] truth I didn't know anyone
[1:25:18] and I knew a lot of people brother
[1:25:20] Greeley did I know a lot of people back
[1:25:22] then I knew a lot of people and I didn't
[1:25:24] know anyone who put up a Christmas tree
[1:25:26] in their home and called themselves a
[1:25:28] believer of this truth I didn't know
[1:25:30] anybody
[1:25:32] and it just got worse and worse and
[1:25:34] worse and worse and worse because nobody
[1:25:35] wanted to talk about it nobody wanted to
[1:25:37] speak about it nobody wanted to preach
[1:25:39] about it now when you start looking in
[1:25:41] Pagan roots
[1:25:42] it opens a lot of doors
[1:25:45] and it shows you how the Christian
[1:25:46] church has moved way off the words in
[1:25:52] the amen's now
[1:25:53] and if you want any homework
[1:25:56] uh go this week and listen to the
[1:25:59] message uh how how did he word it
[1:26:01] Christianity
[1:26:04] a idolatry or is it paganism
[1:26:10] all right so Christianity versus
[1:26:12] idolatry can we get a year on that
[1:26:16] December 17th that's the date what's the
[1:26:19] year
[1:26:21] let's get it let's get it for sure and
[1:26:23] make it easy for people to hear that
[1:26:25] this week
[1:26:28] anybody have a copy of hislops to
[1:26:31] Babylons in your home get that out and
[1:26:34] look at it brother Brandon mentioned
[1:26:35] that didn't he
[1:26:39] 12 17
[1:26:41] 1961 and we will just I'll just show you
[1:26:45] what history says I'll show you what the
[1:26:48] word says I'll show you what the message
[1:26:49] says and then you will know
[1:26:52] again why why we do not celebrate
[1:26:56] Christmas and uh and we don't watch
[1:26:59] others we don't go and watch others
[1:27:00] celebrated either as much as we possibly
[1:27:02] can we are not against Pretty Lights
[1:27:06] you know some people think I must drive
[1:27:08] home and won't even look in a yard
[1:27:10] that's lit you know I'm just such a
[1:27:11] stiff
[1:27:13] I mean I am you know what they call me
[1:27:15] brother David they call me a scrooge
[1:27:18] [Music]
[1:27:20] and they think I'm such a scrooge that I
[1:27:23] don't even enjoy the lot I love Pretty
[1:27:25] Lights
[1:27:26] you know what I I'm so I'm so gaudy at
[1:27:30] times I would just light up the yard and
[1:27:33] leave it lit up all year long I would be
[1:27:35] that lazy neighbor
[1:27:38] I love beautiful lights and I love gifts
[1:27:41] I love to give
[1:27:44] I love to give and I love cranberry
[1:27:47] sauce
[1:27:50] and I love fruitcake
[1:27:54] there's four of us that do
[1:27:56] so I'm not as big of a Scrooge as you
[1:27:59] would think I am
[1:28:00] but I don't believe in the traditions of
[1:28:04] worshiping the sun god
[1:28:07] that I don't do not going to have any
[1:28:09] part of that so Saturday night it didn't
[1:28:12] used I want you to know that once upon a
[1:28:15] time in this church when I said
[1:28:16] something like that the people roared
[1:28:20] they roared but not anymore
[1:28:26] next Saturday night at six o'clock let's
[1:28:29] come together and just hear the facts
[1:28:32] and then when someone comes and tells
[1:28:35] you what we believe you can say no no
[1:28:36] that's not what my pastor believes he's
[1:28:38] he just took a whole session we did one
[1:28:40] one time why my wife and daughters wear
[1:28:43] skirts
[1:28:44] and I didn't try to put that on anybody
[1:28:46] just the word
[1:28:48] just history
[1:28:51] wait till I do one on necklaces and
[1:28:54] jewelry and
[1:28:56] some of those things right from history
[1:29:00] right from the message right from the
[1:29:02] word okay see how tight it gets
[1:29:08] I want the truth the whole truth nothing
[1:29:11] but the truth let's thank God for these
[1:29:15] wonderful wonderful musicians
[1:29:23] is it really
[1:29:27] well we'll just be honoring the prophet
[1:29:30] to the next Saturday night December 17th
[1:29:34] that's the date of the message
[1:29:36] Christianity versus idolatry December
[1:29:38] 17th of what did you say 61.
[1:29:41] and we'll be doing it December 17 2022
[1:29:44] some of the very same truth God is good
[1:29:47] all the time
[1:29:48] and I wished I had a way to see how many
[1:29:50] streamers we lost
[1:29:56] no pouty lips in here
[1:29:59] don't allow them
[1:30:01] let's turn in our Bibles to Deuteronomy
[1:30:05] chapter 30.
[1:30:10] beginning in verse 11.
[1:30:25] another message that's real powerful
[1:30:27] it's not on the Christmas thing but it
[1:30:28] would answer some questions for some of
[1:30:30] you another powerful message that
[1:30:32] brother Brandon brought us is uh why why
[1:30:35] we are not a denomination why am I why
[1:30:38] I'm against organized religion you you
[1:30:41] could you could get your eyes open
[1:30:44] uh and a lot of those things you you
[1:30:46] would be a surprise how many of those
[1:30:49] Pagan Traditions just just rolled right
[1:30:53] over into the Catholic Church
[1:30:55] and how many of those Catholic
[1:30:57] Traditions from the pagans have rolled
[1:31:00] right over into the Pentecostal movement
[1:31:02] right over even into the message of the
[1:31:05] hour did you know I have gone into
[1:31:07] message churches
[1:31:09] to to take communion and then give me a
[1:31:12] little round wafer
[1:31:16] give me a little round wafer that they
[1:31:18] bought at the Bible bookstore and expect
[1:31:20] me to put that round wafer on my tongue
[1:31:22] knowing what brother Branham said about
[1:31:24] that round wafer knowing what history
[1:31:26] said about that round wafer that was a
[1:31:29] god
[1:31:30] that round wafer was a representation of
[1:31:33] the Sun God just like the star on top of
[1:31:35] the tree
[1:31:37] that wasn't new to Christmas
[1:31:39] that came out of the Pagan Worship in
[1:31:41] the Groves right in the Bible
[1:31:45] oh oh
[1:31:47] I couldn't put that round thing on my
[1:31:50] tongue
[1:31:51] somebody said what in the word are you
[1:31:52] going to do you're just going to make a
[1:31:54] big fuss about not taking communion I
[1:31:55] said no I broke it up in little pieces
[1:31:57] still there was nothing round about it I
[1:31:59] rebuked the paganism off of it and I
[1:32:01] said I sanctify this to represent for me
[1:32:03] the body of Jesus Christ and stuck it in
[1:32:05] my mouth
[1:32:07] come on now that ought not to have to
[1:32:09] happen in a church that believes the
[1:32:10] truth
[1:32:12] why why do you think God sent us a a
[1:32:15] message and a messenger
[1:32:18] to help us come together in what the
[1:32:21] word says anybody with me Deuteronomy
[1:32:24] chapter 30 verse 11 don't don't hold
[1:32:28] your amens withhold them please
[1:32:31] for today
[1:32:33] because this is a good word today
[1:32:38] for this commandment which I command
[1:32:40] thee this day it is not hidden from thee
[1:32:44] neither is it far off
[1:32:48] it is not a secret laid up I must be
[1:32:53] reading uh
[1:32:56] if you took it right from what I gave
[1:32:58] you I don't know I must be reading from
[1:33:01] the Amplified could you check that and
[1:33:03] see I'm going to just pause
[1:33:06] because I locked a couple of the phrases
[1:33:08] I can certainly let me uh
[1:33:12] okay there it is I'm so sorry
[1:33:16] and and
[1:33:17] just you all just give me a minute
[1:33:21] amp
[1:33:23] I made a mistake
[1:33:26] for this commandment which I commanded
[1:33:28] you this day is not too difficult for
[1:33:30] you nor is it far off it is not a secret
[1:33:34] laid up in heaven that you should say
[1:33:37] who shall go up for us to heaven and
[1:33:41] bring it to us that we may hear and do
[1:33:45] it
[1:33:46] neither is it beyond the sea that you
[1:33:50] should say who shall go over the sea for
[1:33:53] us and bring it to us that we may hear
[1:33:57] and do it
[1:33:59] but the word
[1:34:03] but the word is where
[1:34:06] it's very near you
[1:34:11] in your mouth
[1:34:14] and in your mind
[1:34:17] and in your heart
[1:34:20] so that you can do it could you give me
[1:34:25] 14 in the King James
[1:34:28] just so it will be more familiar to
[1:34:31] everyone
[1:34:32] but the word is very
[1:34:36] nigh unto thee in thy mouth and in thy
[1:34:40] heart that thou mayest do it
[1:34:45] now let's read Romans 10.
[1:34:49] verse 7 through 11 and I I think that is
[1:34:53] King James it looks like it is
[1:34:56] or who shall be sinned into the deep
[1:35:00] that is to bring up Christ again from
[1:35:04] the dead but what seeth it
[1:35:07] the word is neither here it is again
[1:35:13] even in thy mouth and in thy heart that
[1:35:17] is the word of faith which we preach
[1:35:23] so Moses is giving a word to the
[1:35:27] children of Israel
[1:35:29] the Apostle Paul is giving the same word
[1:35:33] he is quoting from the Torah
[1:35:36] he is quoting from the instruction of
[1:35:39] the law and he is saying to them what
[1:35:42] Moses gave you we are giving you
[1:35:46] the same word
[1:35:49] amen you see there is no real conflict
[1:35:52] in the New Testament and the Old
[1:35:55] Testament
[1:35:57] many of the messianics will would rather
[1:35:59] call it a newer Testament instead of
[1:36:02] making it sound like it is a replacement
[1:36:05] it is not a replacement but it is a
[1:36:08] furtherance of the word
[1:36:11] it's God's word updated
[1:36:15] for a generation
[1:36:17] what do I think the message of the hour
[1:36:19] is I believe in my heart it is God's
[1:36:22] word
[1:36:23] that has been updated for a generation
[1:36:26] are you saying that brother branham's
[1:36:28] sermon is equal to the word the word is
[1:36:31] equal to the word
[1:36:34] so when he's preaching the word it's the
[1:36:37] same word
[1:36:38] amen so I would say the same thing about
[1:36:41] your pastor when he's preaching the word
[1:36:45] it's the same word and where is the word
[1:36:49] it's not in a listening device
[1:36:51] it's not on magnetic tape
[1:36:55] where is the word the word is very near
[1:36:58] you
[1:37:00] it's so close to you that it resides
[1:37:04] in your mouth how did it get in your
[1:37:06] mouth it's in your mind and your heart
[1:37:09] remember that's not the blood pump
[1:37:12] that's the innermost heart
[1:37:16] that is
[1:37:21] that is the womb of the spirit
[1:37:26] the womb of the spirit
[1:37:28] the word is Navy even in thy mouth and
[1:37:32] in thy heart that is the word of faith
[1:37:34] and the Apostle Paul wants everyone to
[1:37:36] know we're preaching that word
[1:37:39] that's very important because in the
[1:37:41] times of the Apostle Paul everyone did
[1:37:44] not have access to the Torah
[1:37:48] there was a copy of it in the synagogue
[1:37:50] but you didn't go to the Torah bookstore
[1:37:54] like you go to the Bible bookstore and
[1:37:56] buy a Bible there was no such thing very
[1:38:00] wealthy people had Scrolls that
[1:38:02] contained a portion of the word
[1:38:05] so only Scholars only students only
[1:38:09] talmudim disciples those who studied the
[1:38:13] truth they had access to the written
[1:38:16] record of God's word thus far
[1:38:19] but the Apostle Paul is saying you don't
[1:38:22] have to feel isolated or cut off from
[1:38:27] the word because even though you may not
[1:38:30] have access always to the written record
[1:38:33] of the word because of the birth the new
[1:38:36] birth
[1:38:37] because Christ has come the word in
[1:38:40] flesh we all have access to the word
[1:38:43] whether in printed form or living form
[1:38:46] and we don't have to go to the synagogue
[1:38:49] to find the word we don't have to go to
[1:38:51] the temple to find the word the word is
[1:38:55] it is even in our mouth it is even in
[1:38:58] our heart that is the word of faith
[1:39:01] which we preach
[1:39:04] that if Thou shalt confess with thy
[1:39:07] mouth the Lord Jesus
[1:39:11] and Shall Believe in thine heart that
[1:39:15] God hath raised him from the dead
[1:39:19] and take the right hand of fellowship at
[1:39:22] the local church
[1:39:26] or be baptized frontward backward once
[1:39:30] twice or Thrice
[1:39:32] it didn't say anything like that
[1:39:34] it didn't say recognize every messenger
[1:39:38] of all the seven Church ages it said if
[1:39:41] Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the
[1:39:44] Lord Jesus and Shall Believe in thine
[1:39:47] heart that God hath raised him from the
[1:39:50] dead thou shall shalt be saved
[1:39:56] brother that's the best news that we
[1:39:59] could possibly hear
[1:40:01] it is our confession it is what we
[1:40:05] accept it is what we believe and it is
[1:40:08] what we confess
[1:40:09] that makes us save
[1:40:11] anybody with me
[1:40:13] for with the heart not the blood pump
[1:40:17] the inner seed of the emotions
[1:40:19] for with the heart man believeth unto
[1:40:22] righteousness
[1:40:23] and with the mouth confession is made
[1:40:27] unto salvation well I can just hear
[1:40:30] brother man I'm preaching the ABCs can't
[1:40:32] you accept believe confess accept
[1:40:36] believe confess except believe confess
[1:40:42] for the scripture saith whosoever
[1:40:45] believeth on him oh man
[1:40:48] shall not be ashamed
[1:40:51] we're not talking about closet believers
[1:40:55] we're not talking about hidden believers
[1:40:57] we're talking about those who are not
[1:40:59] ashamed to accept it to believe it
[1:41:02] and to confess it
[1:41:04] can we say Amen father we ask you today
[1:41:08] to come to us now
[1:41:11] we need you Lord
[1:41:13] we are about to approach the most
[1:41:16] important part of our time together here
[1:41:18] and that is the breaking down of your
[1:41:22] word the declaring of your absolute
[1:41:26] truth so that we might be able to
[1:41:29] receive it with faith
[1:41:32] and watch it produce the results
[1:41:37] it is not a written Testament only but
[1:41:40] it is a living reality
[1:41:44] so we come to you right now asking you
[1:41:47] to help us we are mortal beings
[1:41:49] our minds Wonder
[1:41:52] we are in 2022 and our phones and
[1:41:57] technology
[1:41:59] has wired us
[1:42:02] for ADHD
[1:42:04] we rebuke that spirit
[1:42:07] we take authority over any deficit in
[1:42:12] our attention span and we ask that a
[1:42:16] heart of faith will reach forward and
[1:42:19] embrace this word so that it might be
[1:42:22] able to accomplish something in our
[1:42:23] heart we ask these things in the name of
[1:42:26] our Messiah Yeshua in the name of the
[1:42:28] Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the Saints
[1:42:31] said
[1:42:32] amen you may be seated you again
[1:42:37] you think I could try
[1:42:41] yeah
[1:42:42] turn it down
[1:42:58] some things you should already know
[1:43:04] are you laughing at me
[1:43:08] the truth is everybody here can hear me
[1:43:11] amen
[1:43:13] but maybe not in in uh in the world wide
[1:43:17] web
[1:43:19] I I'm going to tell you some things
[1:43:21] today that you already know
[1:43:24] and and I don't want you to sit back
[1:43:26] like an expert and and you'll say well I
[1:43:28] already know that and and don't chew it
[1:43:30] I want you to chew it anyway
[1:43:33] just because we know something had
[1:43:36] knowledge or even know something by
[1:43:39] heart Revelation doesn't mean we never
[1:43:41] need to revisit that thought to that
[1:43:43] point again I'm a person who believes
[1:43:47] that repetition is a very important part
[1:43:50] of of being able to recall
[1:43:54] repetition helps us to to mix our faith
[1:43:59] with it and accept it so that it brings
[1:44:01] to us
[1:44:04] the rec the results that we are looking
[1:44:06] for
[1:44:07] and that is that it might give us life
[1:44:11] and that it might change us
[1:44:14] and so uh maybe this has not been put
[1:44:19] together in this order for you before
[1:44:21] and uh but I did bring some of these
[1:44:24] particular quotations in the year of
[1:44:27] 2018. how many of you are not here in
[1:44:31] the year 2018. all right and many of you
[1:44:35] streaming well some of you may have been
[1:44:37] going here but may not have been here
[1:44:38] that week
[1:44:39] or the week after or the week after or
[1:44:42] the week after who knows
[1:44:44] and so I don't think this will be a
[1:44:46] problem for you but the Lord took me
[1:44:49] here this week several days he took me
[1:44:52] here and he began to deal with my heart
[1:44:55] about what's coming
[1:44:57] uh to us in the new season
[1:45:00] and we're not a people who necessarily
[1:45:03] believe I'll probably just keep this mic
[1:45:04] I'll I'll probably just keep this one
[1:45:07] we're not a people who necessarily
[1:45:10] believe that everything changes December
[1:45:13] the 31st of any Gregorian year
[1:45:16] we don't even believe that it
[1:45:18] automatically changes because the Hebrew
[1:45:20] year has changed because anyone who
[1:45:23] studies the calendar knows that through
[1:45:25] the years even the Hebrew calendar has
[1:45:29] been a bit corrupted as we know it it's
[1:45:31] a lunar calendar yes but it has been a
[1:45:34] bit corrupted Through The Years they've
[1:45:36] had to add months
[1:45:38] and they have leap what we would call
[1:45:40] like a leap year
[1:45:42] and so we we we don't really know for
[1:45:46] sure that that December 31st is the last
[1:45:49] day of anything
[1:45:51] except we have to start writing a new
[1:45:54] year on our checkbook does anybody need
[1:45:57] me to explain to you what a checkbook is
[1:46:00] and that was my only struggle every year
[1:46:03] was remembering not to write down the
[1:46:06] previous year when I wrote my checks
[1:46:08] well I don't write too many checks I do
[1:46:10] some for the church but I don't write
[1:46:12] too many checks and and that's one thing
[1:46:14] we have to remember but spiritually
[1:46:17] it is not that everything changes a
[1:46:21] season changes for us as the clock
[1:46:25] strikes the Midnight Hour or as the last
[1:46:29] grain of sand Runs Out Of The Hourglass
[1:46:32] but what we do know is because of the
[1:46:36] Ebbs and flows of the spirit
[1:46:40] there are those seasonal shifts and
[1:46:44] changes that we have been talking about
[1:46:47] some have even taken the time and I'm
[1:46:50] not maybe been able to answer all the
[1:46:52] questions I've been getting but some
[1:46:55] have been asking recently what what does
[1:46:58] it look like what are we expecting in
[1:47:01] the new season well we are expecting a
[1:47:05] anointed
[1:47:08] installment
[1:47:10] of God's word
[1:47:12] to our hearts
[1:47:14] that will transform us
[1:47:18] from who we are to who he has created us
[1:47:22] to be
[1:47:24] we are not looking for a new truth
[1:47:28] but we're looking to discover what the
[1:47:31] spirit is underlining
[1:47:35] what the Holy Ghost is highlighting for
[1:47:39] such a time as this
[1:47:41] we're not looking for a new message
[1:47:44] we're not trying to elect a new
[1:47:46] messenger
[1:47:47] but what we do understand in God you
[1:47:50] know I was thinking this morning that
[1:47:53] brother Branham did a wonderful job in
[1:47:57] leaving something for the bride
[1:48:00] he not only stored up truth that
[1:48:04] transforms us
[1:48:06] spiritual food in due season
[1:48:10] but he was not a man who put everything
[1:48:14] on himself and left nothing for anyone
[1:48:18] else
[1:48:19] there are many around this message who
[1:48:23] have placed everything behind them
[1:48:28] they've put everything in the past
[1:48:31] and they have placed everything in who
[1:48:34] brother Branham was
[1:48:36] but I want you to know brother Branham
[1:48:38] didn't do that
[1:48:40] he did not do it as God's mouthpiece he
[1:48:43] didn't do that he in fact kept pointing
[1:48:47] us to Christ
[1:48:49] and he left so much meat on the bones
[1:48:52] for the bride to gnaw off
[1:48:58] you know some people like to call it
[1:49:00] reading between the lines
[1:49:03] I'm a little concerned about that
[1:49:05] approach because this is not open for
[1:49:09] private interpretation
[1:49:11] but what I believe brother Branham did
[1:49:13] was he pointed to a generation after his
[1:49:17] he kept saying when when that in that
[1:49:22] hour at that time
[1:49:25] come on after a while some Glorious Day
[1:49:29] meaning that when he would leave the
[1:49:32] scene God wouldn't stop
[1:49:35] God's economy didn't stop the truth
[1:49:39] didn't stop it just kept marching on and
[1:49:44] on and on he kept pointing us to
[1:49:47] something even greater
[1:49:50] and I don't I don't feel any trepidation
[1:49:53] at all to say that he pointed us to
[1:49:56] something greater
[1:49:57] for what you have seen in one man
[1:50:02] you will then see
[1:50:05] Hallelujah
[1:50:07] in a bridal company
[1:50:08] [Music]
[1:50:10] we're not looking for for a for a
[1:50:12] worldwide Ministry like brother Branham
[1:50:15] had what we're looking for is to is to
[1:50:18] personify that word
[1:50:21] and to manifest that Christ that he
[1:50:24] introduced us to
[1:50:26] that's the Mandate and the commission
[1:50:28] brother Branham didn't give us any
[1:50:30] indication in his Earthly Ministry that
[1:50:33] the adoption of sons had been completed
[1:50:36] nor did he give us any indication that
[1:50:39] The Headstone had already struck the
[1:50:41] pyramid in his Earthly Ministry
[1:50:44] neither did he give us any indication
[1:50:47] that we should know already every
[1:50:50] mystery
[1:50:55] you've got to look at the simple
[1:50:57] punctuation of the scripture
[1:50:59] to be able to understand that there were
[1:51:02] things that went by the prophet
[1:51:07] and there were things that went through
[1:51:09] the prophet
[1:51:11] that he did not bring to the people
[1:51:16] now how in the world can we continue on
[1:51:20] he said that bride is going to have thus
[1:51:25] saith the Lord
[1:51:29] and if she doesn't have the saith the
[1:51:31] Lord she's going to do what
[1:51:34] she's going to keep still
[1:51:37] now there are many who would point us
[1:51:40] backward and say he was referring to his
[1:51:42] own message thus saith the Lord and she
[1:51:46] will have that and she will cling to
[1:51:48] that we must we must cling to that we
[1:51:51] must hold that but I am not one who
[1:51:54] believes that's what he was referring to
[1:51:56] I believe he was referring to a day when
[1:51:59] that headstone comes down totally
[1:52:01] completely to cap this little bride into
[1:52:05] the stature of a perfect man when we
[1:52:09] fully see that Revival that was promised
[1:52:13] to us in the third seal he said it would
[1:52:16] take the revelation of those seven
[1:52:19] unknown Thunders and even though the
[1:52:23] church age book may tell you that that
[1:52:25] was part of brother branham's commission
[1:52:27] and mandate he did not preach that in
[1:52:30] the message
[1:52:32] that is somebody's interpretation of
[1:52:36] what the ministry of brother Branham was
[1:52:39] to come to do and has that ever created
[1:52:43] confusion in this earth
[1:52:46] because there are many camps today and
[1:52:48] this is not of interest to some of you
[1:52:50] but it has to be said
[1:52:52] it has to be said anyway there are many
[1:52:55] camps that have been created around
[1:52:58] different folks's ideas and
[1:53:00] interpretations and Revelations
[1:53:08] remember they took that film to brother
[1:53:11] Brant to brother Greene
[1:53:15] believing that a supernatural sign had
[1:53:19] been manifested on that film that was
[1:53:22] taken of one particular brother
[1:53:25] preaching a particular Revelation or
[1:53:28] understanding of the Thunders
[1:53:30] they took that to brother Greene and
[1:53:34] they hoped that he would see that film
[1:53:37] and he would then say that was God's
[1:53:40] amen
[1:53:41] on that Revelation and that he would
[1:53:44] then carry that to the far reaches of
[1:53:46] the world where he had contacts
[1:53:49] but when he saw it he perceived that it
[1:53:53] was an anomaly
[1:53:55] that it was a flash of light we're not
[1:53:58] talking about anything to do with the
[1:54:00] ministry of brother Branham now we're
[1:54:01] talking about another one of those
[1:54:03] little branches that formed after his
[1:54:07] death where people were trying to hang
[1:54:09] everything in the past not believing
[1:54:13] that there was anything that had not yet
[1:54:16] been written
[1:54:19] watch that
[1:54:21] now brother green said I I would like to
[1:54:23] I'd like to get excited about it
[1:54:27] but he even had it examined
[1:54:30] and there was no doubt that it was a
[1:54:34] reflection of some light on an old uh
[1:54:39] whatever 18 millimeter what eight
[1:54:42] million what do they have 16 millimeter
[1:54:43] film what did they have back then
[1:54:46] it was a a poor quality and It produced
[1:54:50] a light moving around in certain fashion
[1:54:53] that caused a whole movement
[1:54:59] thousands of people embrace it around
[1:55:01] the world
[1:55:03] and they hang it on little simple things
[1:55:07] some of which may not even be signs and
[1:55:10] wonders
[1:55:12] so we must not hang our faith on things
[1:55:15] that we don't fully understand
[1:55:18] but this one thing I know it's not all
[1:55:21] over folks
[1:55:23] if you want to quote me go ahead it's
[1:55:26] not all over folks
[1:55:28] God didn't finish moving with his bride
[1:55:32] her Ministry is not over yet
[1:55:36] it hasn't even fallen into full swing
[1:55:40] but it will
[1:55:42] and it'll fall with such rapid
[1:55:44] succession
[1:55:46] [Music]
[1:55:50] and we will wonder how we ever grew
[1:55:52] weary
[1:55:53] in waiting on it to be
[1:55:56] we will repent before God of Our Hope
[1:55:59] deferred
[1:56:00] and we will move as quickly as the lamb
[1:56:04] moves and as slowly as the lamb moves
[1:56:09] and we'll say what the lamb says and do
[1:56:12] what the lamb does
[1:56:15] and there will be a harvest
[1:56:17] there will be a harvest of souls outside
[1:56:21] the message Circle
[1:56:23] and it will come just like what we read
[1:56:28] whosoever shall confess with thy mouth
[1:56:31] the Lord Jesus and Shall Believe in
[1:56:34] thine heart that God has raised him from
[1:56:36] the dead Thou shalt be saved
[1:56:39] you do not determine your election by
[1:56:42] what you believe
[1:56:44] what you believe is determined by your
[1:56:47] election
[1:56:48] you can't change your Doctrine and
[1:56:51] change your position
[1:56:53] if you should have in your hand anybody
[1:56:55] with me
[1:56:56] if you should have in your hand a a
[1:56:59] handful of coins does anybody know what
[1:57:01] change is
[1:57:03] don't you just love to see these little
[1:57:05] yuppies
[1:57:06] at the at the drive-through
[1:57:09] and they don't know how to make change
[1:57:14] they know how to swipe
[1:57:17] come on
[1:57:18] they don't know how to make change
[1:57:21] they don't hardly know what change is
[1:57:25] brother random talks about change you
[1:57:27] can have a handful you can have a half a
[1:57:29] dollar anybody ever seen a half a dollar
[1:57:35] anybody ever seen a dollar coin
[1:57:38] my my
[1:57:40] we've had silver dollars and we've had
[1:57:43] Susan B Anthony Dollars where are they
[1:57:46] they're hardly even circulating anymore
[1:57:49] and we've had 50 cent pieces half a
[1:57:52] dollars and we had quarters
[1:57:55] and we had dimes and we had nickels and
[1:57:59] we have pennies and we know exactly how
[1:58:01] much each of those are worth
[1:58:03] and I want you to know God has that
[1:58:07] he has some vessels of silver
[1:58:10] and some vessels of gold
[1:58:12] he has perhaps some brass vessels and I
[1:58:16] want you to know the silver vessel can't
[1:58:18] look at the Gold vessel and say oh I
[1:58:20] wish I was gold
[1:58:22] and become gold
[1:58:25] the silver vessel can't say I'll go to
[1:58:27] church where you go to church and see if
[1:58:28] it'll make me gold
[1:58:30] that's not the way it works
[1:58:33] the Apostle said there are some vessels
[1:58:35] unto honor
[1:58:37] and some vessels unto dishonor
[1:58:40] there are some who carry the seed of God
[1:58:43] and there are those who carry other
[1:58:45] seeds
[1:58:49] anybody with me
[1:58:50] I chose all 12 of you
[1:58:54] but one of you is a devil
[1:58:59] but let me tell you what brother random
[1:59:01] said about that devil
[1:59:02] he said he cast out devils
[1:59:04] he healed the sick
[1:59:08] but here's what he couldn't do he
[1:59:10] couldn't tarry and receive the genuine
[1:59:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:59:15] he may have had a feeling he may have
[1:59:18] had a sensation he may have had a
[1:59:19] goosebump he may have had a loud mouth
[1:59:23] he might have had a jump or a jerk or a
[1:59:25] shark
[1:59:27] he might have had a shoe or a hoe or a
[1:59:30] whoa
[1:59:31] but he could not receive the genuine
[1:59:33] baptism of the Holy Ghost because a half
[1:59:35] dollar can't make himself a dollar
[1:59:38] and a dime can't make himself a quarter
[1:59:41] and a nickel can't make himself a dime
[1:59:43] and a penny can't make himself a nickel
[1:59:47] now you know that will really bust some
[1:59:49] some new age philosophy
[1:59:52] because the world today says you can be
[1:59:54] anything you want to be
[1:59:56] wrong
[1:59:58] anybody willing to agree with something
[2:00:00] as rough as old school is that
[2:00:02] wrong
[2:00:04] within your capacity
[2:00:07] within God's program and plan for you
[2:00:10] you can be all that you desire to be
[2:00:13] but everybody's not going to be the
[2:00:15] president
[2:00:16] and why you'd want to be beats me
[2:00:20] everybody's not going to be the CEO of a
[2:00:23] big company somebody said you can if you
[2:00:25] want to be not according to the word
[2:00:28] you have every day of your life recorded
[2:00:31] in the book of God before you're ever
[2:00:33] born the Bible said every one of your
[2:00:35] days are written in his book and if God
[2:00:38] wrote you in as a CEO of a big
[2:00:41] Corporation that's exactly what you can
[2:00:43] be
[2:00:44] if God wrote you in as a senator for the
[2:00:47] state of Alabama that's exactly what you
[2:00:50] can be
[2:00:52] if he wrote you in as a pastor that's
[2:00:55] exactly what you can be an evangelist
[2:00:58] that's exactly what you can be
[2:01:00] with me
[2:01:02] we don't make ourselves anything
[2:01:05] we yield to God now if that if you think
[2:01:09] that means we ought to be lazy
[2:01:11] if you think that means we shouldn't try
[2:01:13] to raise the bar
[2:01:15] no we should also remember that if we
[2:01:18] always do what we've always done we'll
[2:01:20] always be what we've always been
[2:01:22] somebody ought to help me preach
[2:01:25] [Music]
[2:01:27] some of us are living in the environment
[2:01:29] that we created
[2:01:31] and we are reaping seed that we have
[2:01:33] sown and if we don't like the Harvest we
[2:01:36] ought to change our seed
[2:01:39] we should speak a higher speak
[2:01:45] walk a higher walk
[2:01:47] that doesn't mean we shouldn't grow
[2:01:50] it doesn't mean that we shouldn't submit
[2:01:52] to the contractions of Zion and be
[2:01:56] birthed from virtue to Virtue we must
[2:01:59] grow
[2:02:00] we must not sit where we are and say
[2:02:02] this is what God Made Me
[2:02:05] because we don't see the whole book
[2:02:07] we hardly see today's page
[2:02:11] some of you hardly know what you'll be
[2:02:13] doing this afternoon at five o'clock
[2:02:17] some I've talked to are convinced that
[2:02:19] it won't be raining
[2:02:25] have you ever tried to tell volleyball
[2:02:28] addicts
[2:02:30] the weather report
[2:02:33] no sorry it won't be raining that's not
[2:02:36] gonna rain
[2:02:38] come on
[2:02:40] you don't know what God's book says
[2:02:43] I don't even know
[2:02:45] not about five o'clock couldn't tell you
[2:02:48] all I know is what the weatherman said
[2:02:50] we know he don't always tell the truth
[2:02:52] he says that by 4 P.M 90 chance of rain
[2:02:59] in Smith Station Alabama
[2:03:01] and by 5 PM 100 Chance by 6 p.m 100
[2:03:07] Chance by 780 by 860 by 9 45.
[2:03:15] but you don't know I don't know
[2:03:17] how many of you lived in Alabama long
[2:03:19] enough to know we can Reign on one side
[2:03:21] of the road and not rain on your side of
[2:03:23] the road sun shining over there and it
[2:03:25] raining over here come on
[2:03:27] how many of you know there can be as
[2:03:29] much as a 10 degree not five degree a 10
[2:03:32] degree difference between the northern
[2:03:34] part of Auburn and where we live we've
[2:03:36] watched it there could be a 30 degree
[2:03:38] difference between here in Atlanta when
[2:03:40] the weather is really shifting around
[2:03:42] when a cold front's moving down
[2:03:45] you don't know and I don't know all I
[2:03:49] want to know is what God wants to reveal
[2:03:51] to me and all I need to know is where I
[2:03:54] am right now
[2:03:55] I want to say that again
[2:03:58] what I really need to know is what I am
[2:04:00] right now and where I'm walking right
[2:04:03] now and what God would have me to be
[2:04:05] right now some of you hadn't gotten over
[2:04:07] the holiday you need to get over the
[2:04:09] holiday and get back to where we are
[2:04:10] right now
[2:04:16] and next Saturday I'll show you right in
[2:04:18] the message why brother Branham said we
[2:04:20] cling to those things
[2:04:22] he said there's something wrong in her
[2:04:24] heart
[2:04:25] I'm just telling you what he said and if
[2:04:28] I was anywhere else they'd say just say
[2:04:30] what he said
[2:04:32] come on
[2:04:33] so I want you to understand I say this a
[2:04:36] lot but I want to make sure you know
[2:04:38] where this comes from in the message
[2:04:40] which happens to be the first message
[2:04:42] that I ever heard of brother Branham the
[2:04:45] spoken word is the Original Seed March
[2:04:48] the 18th of 1962 paragraph 119 brother
[2:04:53] Branham tells us what his mission is
[2:04:55] what his commission is why he's here
[2:04:59] he said my mission
[2:05:02] that I believe that God has called me
[2:05:04] for
[2:05:05] I have to say some personal things today
[2:05:08] because that's what I told you I do see
[2:05:11] and tell the world
[2:05:14] my mission I believe to the Earth is
[2:05:16] what is to forerun
[2:05:21] the coming word
[2:05:29] he didn't say the word that now is
[2:05:34] or what I preached last night
[2:05:37] he seemed to believe that there was an
[2:05:41] installment of the word that was to come
[2:05:48] and I happen to know there is
[2:05:52] somebody said how could you say such a
[2:05:54] thing as that because I wasn't alive in
[2:05:56] 1962
[2:05:57] [Music]
[2:05:59] and if anything is a part of this word I
[2:06:01] am
[2:06:04] so there was a word that was not yet on
[2:06:07] the scene in 1962.
[2:06:11] and brother Benham said my mission is to
[2:06:13] forerun the coming word see and watch
[2:06:15] what he says the coming word which is
[2:06:20] Christ Christ
[2:06:21] where where
[2:06:24] in the manger
[2:06:28] on the cross as a crucifix
[2:06:31] in a tomb in Jerusalem
[2:06:34] no a Christ now living in his bride body
[2:06:41] [Music]
[2:06:44] the bride coming of Christ
[2:06:47] the denominations will never see the
[2:06:50] broad coming of Christ
[2:06:51] they're not looking for it
[2:06:54] they don't even take time to
[2:06:55] differentiate between the comings
[2:06:58] they read in King James version coming
[2:07:01] and they don't even sometimes stop to
[2:07:03] see which coming he's talking about
[2:07:06] is this the physical Earthly coming or
[2:07:08] is this the coming of the word
[2:07:11] because he talked about a parasia
[2:07:15] they like to call it perusia
[2:07:18] he talked about a parasia coming
[2:07:22] and it was a word coming in spirit form
[2:07:26] why because he would live in another
[2:07:29] body
[2:07:30] not the body of the Lord Jesus not just
[2:07:33] in the body of William Branham
[2:07:35] but in a body of believers
[2:07:38] surrendered
[2:07:40] surrendered
[2:07:42] so what if we have to come in here and
[2:07:43] clear I feel a few people women it
[2:07:45] blesses my blesser
[2:07:47] so what if we have to come in here and
[2:07:49] clear the atmosphere sometime we're not
[2:07:51] like Native Americans and we don't burn
[2:07:53] sage and we don't go through here trying
[2:07:55] to clear the atmosphere with sage
[2:07:58] we don't try to put on the oils and see
[2:08:00] if we can clear the atmosphere with our
[2:08:02] oils I put on a bunch before I come out
[2:08:04] here
[2:08:05] none of them were to clear the
[2:08:07] atmosphere
[2:08:09] someone was to help me
[2:08:12] because I needed some support we don't
[2:08:15] hang crystals in here because we want to
[2:08:17] see if we can change the vibrational
[2:08:19] reading
[2:08:21] or the vibe
[2:08:26] or correct someone's aura
[2:08:30] no that's not how we get rid of Spooks
[2:08:32] and haints
[2:08:34] what we do is we say hey
[2:08:37] somebody brought something in here that
[2:08:40] they should have left at the door
[2:08:42] I don't point my fingers at anybody and
[2:08:44] what I was feeling couldn't have been
[2:08:46] one person only
[2:08:48] what I was feeling had to be several
[2:08:50] people
[2:08:51] there was no arguments in my car coming
[2:08:54] over here today before I left my house
[2:08:56] there weren't any arguments or ill words
[2:08:58] spoken that I know of once I left I
[2:09:01] couldn't tell you what happened
[2:09:02] but when I got up here on this platform
[2:09:04] I could feel the swirl coming
[2:09:08] and I could see that that some were
[2:09:11] already distracted
[2:09:13] and here in body but hadn't showed up
[2:09:15] here in spirit yet I want to tell you
[2:09:18] something we're not denominational
[2:09:20] people we can't sit through a three or
[2:09:23] four hour service in body only and let
[2:09:26] our spirit linger somewhere else
[2:09:29] we've got to pull our spirit into here
[2:09:31] because it's not our fleshly body that
[2:09:33] needs to be fed or stimulated it's the
[2:09:36] inner being
[2:09:37] the word doesn't come to make you feel
[2:09:40] good
[2:09:43] the word comes to transform us
[2:09:46] [Music]
[2:09:47] not from the outside in
[2:09:50] but from the inside out
[2:09:53] how many of you believe the word is
[2:09:54] becoming flesh again in the body of the
[2:09:57] Bride of Jesus Christ somebody said I
[2:09:59] can't say that because I've had a week
[2:10:01] from hell no you didn't you had a week
[2:10:03] out of his book
[2:10:06] free that's
[2:10:08] it you had a week out of his book
[2:10:10] it might not have been pleasant but it
[2:10:13] didn't come to bless you it come to
[2:10:15] prepare you
[2:10:18] because there is a people that are being
[2:10:21] prepared as forerunners for the final
[2:10:26] manifestation of Christ in the Earth
[2:10:31] the bride's Revival is the last
[2:10:36] the last one there will be no other
[2:10:39] after that
[2:10:41] brother Branham said we're yes will the
[2:10:43] bride will have a Ministry she's having
[2:10:45] that now so from from the 60s all the
[2:10:48] way to now there has been measures
[2:10:52] deposits
[2:10:53] places where Revival stirred and the
[2:10:57] Word was Vindicated and God met needs we
[2:11:01] have had many I tell you I I feel like I
[2:11:03] may fly any minute here
[2:11:05] I feel something
[2:11:08] I know it's not my feeling
[2:11:10] it is not by feeling but I feel
[2:11:13] something swirling around me
[2:11:15] I may just fulfill one of those dreams
[2:11:18] anybody dream of just lifting off the
[2:11:20] ground
[2:11:21] I I may just fly around in here after a
[2:11:23] while I feel something stirring around
[2:11:26] me and I don't want to miss it we don't
[2:11:29] use sage and we don't use music and we
[2:11:32] don't use anything else what I mean by
[2:11:33] that is playing some kind of musical
[2:11:36] recording hoping that it will you know
[2:11:38] make the atmosphere better no no no we
[2:11:40] use we use uh the weapon that has been
[2:11:42] given to us we use our praise
[2:11:46] we don't just bask in Praise we wore in
[2:11:49] Praise
[2:11:51] we realize that when we offer God an
[2:11:54] exuberant praise
[2:11:56] let the let the let the high let the
[2:12:00] high praises of God let the high praises
[2:12:04] of God be in their mouth and what
[2:12:07] read the rest
[2:12:09] and a two-edged sword
[2:12:12] in their hands
[2:12:16] your sword is the word the word is part
[2:12:19] of your weapon the name is part of your
[2:12:22] weapon the blood life is part of your
[2:12:25] weapon but praise and worship is also
[2:12:29] part of your weapon so we didn't burn
[2:12:31] sage and we didn't try to uh you know
[2:12:34] rebuke this or that or whatever is uh
[2:12:36] except led by the spirit we didn't have
[2:12:39] some program look it up in some
[2:12:42] encyclopedia how to clear the atmosphere
[2:12:44] we just started doing what we were
[2:12:46] created to do
[2:12:49] took a little reminder
[2:12:51] we just needed a little reminder
[2:12:53] and once we got a reminder we took off
[2:12:56] oh yes the prey shifted the sincerity of
[2:13:00] the heart shifted because as soon as the
[2:13:03] distraction is removed the sincerity of
[2:13:05] the heart always shifts
[2:13:09] as soon as we place our attention back
[2:13:12] on what matters the most and let me say
[2:13:14] this to you that's not building a great
[2:13:16] service
[2:13:17] what matters the most is Jesus be
[2:13:19] glorified Jesus be manifested and Jesus
[2:13:23] come and be Jesus not only to us
[2:13:26] but in US that's why we're here
[2:13:30] and so he goes on
[2:13:33] this bride's Revival let me just let me
[2:13:36] just see close that thought out this
[2:13:37] bride's Revival
[2:13:39] it's not like any other Revival it's
[2:13:41] another denominational Revival it's not
[2:13:43] to produce a few more Church age heroes
[2:13:48] in fact it's to deliver the bride from
[2:13:51] any residue of the church ages
[2:13:57] because we are still wearing some of the
[2:13:59] residue of the church ages and we are
[2:14:03] still wearing some of the residue of our
[2:14:05] denominational background for instance
[2:14:06] you shift a little different in here and
[2:14:08] somebody will say well we never did it
[2:14:10] that way in our church
[2:14:12] [Music]
[2:14:14] folks it happens that way every church
[2:14:17] is Sovereign no church is the same but
[2:14:20] if you're referring to a denominational
[2:14:22] church I want to take a moment say
[2:14:24] thanks be to God
[2:14:26] because he didn't call this to us as a
[2:14:29] church he didn't reveal this to us as a
[2:14:32] church it's more than a church
[2:14:34] foreign
[2:14:35] it's the holy spirit that has kept us
[2:14:37] out of the social justice movement
[2:14:39] [Music]
[2:14:42] that's what kept us out of that we we
[2:14:44] all love the sanctity of life
[2:14:48] but we don't let that be our our driving
[2:14:51] force
[2:14:53] we may do a little something I I give
[2:14:55] money to the Lee County Food Bank on a
[2:14:58] regular basis but I can't feed the whole
[2:15:00] County
[2:15:01] but I can do what I can but I don't make
[2:15:04] that the driving force of this church
[2:15:06] because he didn't say I want a church
[2:15:09] here on these uh Acres of ground to
[2:15:13] function just like every other Church
[2:15:15] except they believe a little different
[2:15:17] he said I'm looking for something
[2:15:19] entirely different and that's what the
[2:15:21] bride church is supposed to be around
[2:15:22] the world and yet we start looking like
[2:15:25] denominational churches more and more
[2:15:27] and more and more as the years go by we
[2:15:29] adopt programs
[2:15:32] the very thing brother Branham preached
[2:15:34] about and yet so many churches around
[2:15:37] this message are guilty of trying to
[2:15:39] draw people in and keep them in
[2:15:43] by keeping their hands busy
[2:15:47] I want you to understand that busy hands
[2:15:50] is not enough if your heart is not
[2:15:53] postured in love for the bridegroom
[2:15:57] staying busy is not enough if you don't
[2:16:00] know him as your lover staying busy is
[2:16:03] not enough if you don't lay your head on
[2:16:05] his chest and hear what causes his heart
[2:16:08] to beat
[2:16:10] is intimacy
[2:16:13] it's time in the tent
[2:16:18] it's time in the tent
[2:16:22] there's no room in the tent
[2:16:25] for the friend of the bridegroom
[2:16:29] there's no room in the tent for the maid
[2:16:31] of honor
[2:16:34] there's no room in the tent for the
[2:16:37] seven Church age Messengers
[2:16:39] there's no room in the tent for your
[2:16:41] pastor
[2:16:42] or your apostle
[2:16:44] or even your prophet
[2:16:46] there's only room in that tent of
[2:16:49] fellowship and intimacy for you and the
[2:16:53] bridegroom
[2:16:55] and if you're not cultivating that turn
[2:16:57] off the television
[2:16:59] if you're not cultivating that turn off
[2:17:02] the computer if you're not cultivating
[2:17:05] that put your phone down
[2:17:09] because there will be no Revival no True
[2:17:12] full force Revival in the bride until we
[2:17:16] love him more than we love ourselves
[2:17:20] until we love the word more than we love
[2:17:24] this world
[2:17:29] but it's coming
[2:17:31] my mission that I believe I'm on page
[2:17:34] one
[2:17:35] my mission that I believe that God has
[2:17:37] called me for I have to say some
[2:17:39] personal things he said
[2:17:41] because that's what I told you I do my
[2:17:42] mission I believe to the Earth is to
[2:17:45] forerun
[2:17:46] the coming word see the coming word
[2:17:50] which is Christ and Christ in him
[2:17:54] has the millennium
[2:17:57] and has everything right there
[2:18:03] because he is the word
[2:18:05] you want to know where the Millennium is
[2:18:09] in Christ
[2:18:13] the anointed one
[2:18:15] that's where the Millennium is it's in
[2:18:16] him you want to know where the Sabbath
[2:18:18] is
[2:18:19] [Music]
[2:18:21] it's in him you want to know where
[2:18:22] Tabernacles are
[2:18:24] in him pass over in him
[2:18:27] come on you and we're worship true
[2:18:29] worship takes place
[2:18:31] in him do you know where the coming of
[2:18:32] the Lord is in him
[2:18:36] what we find out is that we have
[2:18:38] sometimes raised up walls of
[2:18:40] foundational Faith walls of Doctrine
[2:18:43] and we would rather cling to our
[2:18:46] understanding
[2:18:47] rather than see discover find out what
[2:18:52] is the root of it all
[2:18:54] the root of it all is Christ
[2:18:56] if you can't find Christ on every page
[2:18:58] of the written word you haven't known
[2:19:00] him the way you desire and need to know
[2:19:02] him he's there come on if you can't find
[2:19:05] Christ in every chapter of the book
[2:19:07] you're missing something because he's
[2:19:09] there this is the written record
[2:19:11] [Music]
[2:19:13] of a portion of who he is
[2:19:16] I've heard preachers hold up the Bible
[2:19:18] and say this is the fullness of Christ
[2:19:20] it is not
[2:19:22] [Music]
[2:19:26] it's about to get tight in here
[2:19:29] I'm hurrying this is hurry you know me
[2:19:34] it's going to rain tonight anyway
[2:19:38] I've heard people hold up the Bible and
[2:19:41] say this is the totality of Christ it is
[2:19:44] not
[2:19:45] [Music]
[2:19:48] somebody said I'm gonna need a scripture
[2:19:50] glad you ask
[2:19:53] the Apostle said the world
[2:19:56] could not hold the volume
[2:20:01] the world couldn't hold the books if
[2:20:04] everything he did
[2:20:06] was written in the book
[2:20:08] so I'm telling you there's a whole lot
[2:20:10] of what God did even in his Earthly
[2:20:12] Ministry through Jesus our Messiah
[2:20:14] that's not in this word and that is why
[2:20:18] it is not enough for you to memorize if
[2:20:20] we should we must we must hide it in our
[2:20:23] heart that we would not sin against God
[2:20:26] but it is not enough to memorize like I
[2:20:28] said last Sunday it is not how much of
[2:20:30] the word of God you go through it's how
[2:20:33] much of God's word goes through you
[2:20:35] we need a holy digestion to take place
[2:20:38] when we hear this written word and read
[2:20:41] this written word and study this written
[2:20:44] word we need the reality and the Living
[2:20:47] Word to come Among Us
[2:20:51] invite him into your bedroom
[2:20:53] when you sit down to read the written
[2:20:55] word invite the Living Word to come
[2:20:59] John 1 didn't say in the beginning was
[2:21:02] the word and the Word was with God and
[2:21:03] the word became printed form
[2:21:07] he didn't say in the beginning was the
[2:21:10] word and the Word was with God and the
[2:21:11] word became a magnetic tape
[2:21:16] he said in the beginning what's the word
[2:21:18] and the Word was with God and the Word
[2:21:19] was God and the word became flesh
[2:21:22] flesh somebody say flesh what is that
[2:21:26] it's a body
[2:21:28] the word is not looking for a page the
[2:21:30] word is looking for a body
[2:21:33] what house will you build me
[2:21:36] one of the last messages he preached
[2:21:38] what house will you build me
[2:21:40] that's where it is and that's what you
[2:21:43] and I hate
[2:21:44] that's what you and I have been
[2:21:46] hand-picked for
[2:21:49] come on and should some of us go by the
[2:21:52] way of the Grave our children
[2:21:55] have been picked for it and if our
[2:21:57] children should pass our grandchildren
[2:21:59] have been picked for it because we are
[2:22:02] living in the foretold generation
[2:22:05] it doesn't take a real scholar to
[2:22:07] determine that we're living in the end
[2:22:09] of the end
[2:22:11] we're living in the last days
[2:22:13] but everything you see that has yet to
[2:22:15] take place could take place in Rapid
[2:22:17] secession and happen so quickly that you
[2:22:19] wouldn't hardly know what had gone
[2:22:20] around on around you except that you're
[2:22:22] caught up in the middle of it by the
[2:22:24] spirit that's how close we are to the
[2:22:26] coming of the Lord
[2:22:27] and what coming are you talking about
[2:22:29] I'm talking about the bride coming
[2:22:34] he cannot pick up that body until he has
[2:22:37] picked up a body
[2:22:40] come on
[2:22:42] and this is the body not this building
[2:22:45] not this group of people only
[2:22:48] but it's those who are hungry
[2:22:51] I guarantee you they're not arguing over
[2:22:53] clear fingernail polish
[2:22:59] I guarantee you that word bride she's
[2:23:01] not worrying about whether she can wear
[2:23:03] this or wear that or do this or do that
[2:23:05] or not
[2:23:06] that word bride is not worried about the
[2:23:09] a little extra effort it takes to pin up
[2:23:11] those splits
[2:23:14] she's gonna do it
[2:23:18] she's going to take that extra time
[2:23:20] because when she leaves her house to go
[2:23:23] out into the workforce and when she
[2:23:25] leaves her house to go out to church or
[2:23:28] to go out into the world she is reminded
[2:23:30] that she is the Earthly representation
[2:23:34] of Jesus Christ not a pope
[2:23:39] not a pope
[2:23:41] but a people
[2:23:43] a Zion people
[2:23:45] a people who will be the word that was
[2:23:47] to come
[2:23:48] come on
[2:23:50] the coming word which is Christ and
[2:23:51] Christ in him has the Millennium and has
[2:23:54] everything right here because he is the
[2:23:55] word all right there he was now who are
[2:23:58] you you're the word born bride
[2:24:00] you're not born of uh of like he used to
[2:24:03] say Charles and Ella Branham
[2:24:05] you were born of something higher than
[2:24:07] Charles and ellebranum
[2:24:09] you were born of something higher than
[2:24:12] Ralph and Jane Shelley
[2:24:14] you were born higher you just name your
[2:24:17] parents name you were born of something
[2:24:18] higher than that that is how your
[2:24:21] Earthly body was expressed that body is
[2:24:23] not who you are
[2:24:26] who you are didn't come from Mama and
[2:24:29] Daddy it didn't come from pedigrees who
[2:24:31] you are came from God Almighty the
[2:24:34] Creator the one who breathed breath into
[2:24:37] the nostrils of men the one who breathed
[2:24:40] and they received the Holy Ghost
[2:24:43] the one who knew it all before all ever
[2:24:45] began to unfold in the one who created
[2:24:47] everything we know from that which was
[2:24:49] nothing
[2:24:50] he didn't gather some some uh you know
[2:24:53] raw materials together and make the
[2:24:55] Earth he stepped out on nothing and
[2:24:57] spoke and everything that was formed was
[2:24:59] formed how many of you are glad to serve
[2:25:01] a God Like That
[2:25:02] a few more minutes spoken word is the
[2:25:05] Original Seed same message now paragraph
[2:25:07] 148 he begins to tell us who we are all
[2:25:11] of God's Sons must be the same
[2:25:17] can you follow that
[2:25:19] must be the same
[2:25:25] they're not all going to be fat
[2:25:27] they're not all going to be skinny
[2:25:29] they're not all going to be sway back
[2:25:31] they're not all going to have the same
[2:25:33] earlobes
[2:25:35] aren't you glad because some people's
[2:25:37] got ugly earlobes
[2:25:44] they're not all going to have the same
[2:25:49] my poor old mama she prayed so hard that
[2:25:51] I wouldn't have my granddaddy Shelly's
[2:25:53] earlobes
[2:25:55] I didn't get them but I don't know if
[2:25:56] the ones I got was any better
[2:25:59] but they were more like her so she was
[2:26:01] pleased
[2:26:02] it's not about that
[2:26:04] we're not all gonna particularly like
[2:26:06] same thing
[2:26:12] some people like animals more than
[2:26:14] others
[2:26:16] some people like color coordinating more
[2:26:19] than others
[2:26:23] Lord when our children were little we
[2:26:25] just wanted them all to smile
[2:26:27] we didn't have time to worry about
[2:26:29] whether they all matched
[2:26:31] come on
[2:26:33] we just want them to smile just so small
[2:26:36] we're paying money to have your picture
[2:26:39] made just smile
[2:26:43] some people care more about this and
[2:26:45] more about the other
[2:26:48] did you know there are some people who
[2:26:50] don't like grits
[2:26:53] if you can call them people
[2:27:03] and then there are those who ruin them
[2:27:05] with sugar
[2:27:07] just don't eat them
[2:27:09] just eat cream of wheat
[2:27:11] don't ruin our grits would you just
[2:27:13] leave them alone
[2:27:16] of course I learned in Puerto Rico that
[2:27:18] rice with sugar is good I I I'd not been
[2:27:22] I mean I'd had rice pudding but I didn't
[2:27:25] know you could just sprinkle a little
[2:27:26] sugar on on rice and make breakfast but
[2:27:28] boy you can make a pretty good breakfast
[2:27:30] like that we don't all like the same
[2:27:32] thing we don't all look the same way we
[2:27:34] don't all live in the same kind of house
[2:27:35] some people want to open concept
[2:27:39] some people like a little more
[2:27:41] confinement
[2:27:44] some people want to paint all the wood
[2:27:50] if God would have wanted all trees to be
[2:27:52] white he'd have painted them white
[2:27:57] everybody wants a farmhouse these days
[2:28:00] anybody with me
[2:28:01] never worked a day on a farm
[2:28:06] most people that won't farm houses now
[2:28:08] never pick to pee
[2:28:10] never stoop down I'm going to tell you
[2:28:12] something anybody can pick peas you
[2:28:14] barely have to bow
[2:28:16] but if you're a if you're a real farmer
[2:28:18] you've had to pick butter beans
[2:28:20] how many of you know they don't grow off
[2:28:22] the top on Long stalks
[2:28:24] you just about have to get down to where
[2:28:26] they are to get to them that's a real
[2:28:28] farmer but everybody's got what they
[2:28:30] like
[2:28:31] if I ever get a chance to watch a house
[2:28:33] show on uh on an app or something I like
[2:28:37] to watch the ones where they strip all
[2:28:39] the paint off
[2:28:41] take everything back to how it looked in
[2:28:43] the natural
[2:28:44] but if my wife was going to look at one
[2:28:46] which I don't think she gets to very
[2:28:47] often but if she did get to she'd want
[2:28:49] to look at one where you paint all the
[2:28:51] wood
[2:28:52] we don't want nobody to know it's a tree
[2:28:56] but this word said all of God's Sons
[2:28:59] must be the same and I promise you it's
[2:29:02] not all the same personality
[2:29:05] yes sir to be this is what makes us the
[2:29:08] same this is where we've got to find our
[2:29:10] common ground
[2:29:12] oh yes to be born of the word and
[2:29:20] and to be born of the word and
[2:29:23] spirit
[2:29:25] now look at what he said brings us back
[2:29:28] to the spoken word again like in John 3
[2:29:33] see
[2:29:35] to be born of the water and the spirit
[2:29:37] that does what does it do
[2:29:42] then it brings you right back again
[2:29:47] unto the place of where you should have
[2:29:51] been at the beginning
[2:29:55] that's the reason of Christ's death
[2:30:05] it wasn't so that someone could pray the
[2:30:07] sinner's prayer
[2:30:09] the reason Christ died was to bring us
[2:30:12] right back again to where
[2:30:16] read it again
[2:30:18] declare it one time sons of God
[2:30:21] that's that's who we are
[2:30:24] that's who we are that's why we're the
[2:30:25] same
[2:30:26] we will never live peacefully peaceably
[2:30:30] or peacefully with one another as long
[2:30:33] as we try to make everybody the same as
[2:30:36] us
[2:30:46] some people are never going to like
[2:30:47] collards
[2:30:51] some people are never going to get along
[2:30:53] with people
[2:30:55] like other people do
[2:30:58] they're not always going to relate to
[2:31:00] others the same
[2:31:02] the reason why we can't see God moving
[2:31:05] is because we're looking for God to do
[2:31:08] that
[2:31:09] that's not the biggest thing that God's
[2:31:11] got to do in US
[2:31:12] make us get along better with each other
[2:31:15] all those things become the fruit
[2:31:18] of what the word is doing on the inside
[2:31:20] you let the character of Christ be
[2:31:23] formed in you and you will see people
[2:31:32] Benjamin stand up just a minute get your
[2:31:34] phone go to Facebook
[2:31:36] and read
[2:31:39] the quote we were this quote came out of
[2:31:42] a discussion that we were having around
[2:31:43] I start to see around the table but we'd
[2:31:45] already left come here we'd already left
[2:31:47] the table on Friday but the whole family
[2:31:49] was there and we were having a
[2:31:51] discussion about different things
[2:31:52] various things and I read this quote and
[2:31:55] I didn't just read the small portion
[2:31:56] that Benjamin posted I read the whole a
[2:31:59] couple of paragraphs of it it's such a
[2:32:01] powerful thing and then we discuss what
[2:32:04] it means to love somebody
[2:32:07] and then we started talking about what
[2:32:09] that really means you know the Bible
[2:32:10] said Greater Love
[2:32:16] it's not always my responsibility to
[2:32:19] make you feel loved
[2:32:20] [Music]
[2:32:22] it's not always your responsibility to
[2:32:24] make me feel loved but greater love hath
[2:32:28] no man than this
[2:32:32] the real question is not whether you
[2:32:34] like someone
[2:32:35] no it's not you'd like to make it that
[2:32:40] but the real question is whether or not
[2:32:42] you're willing to lay down your life
[2:32:46] for that person
[2:32:49] die in their place
[2:32:53] I mentioned a young lady and her
[2:32:55] boyfriend who who got out they saw
[2:32:57] someone run over on the road and they
[2:33:00] got out to try to keep this person from
[2:33:02] being hit again and and could not get in
[2:33:05] time until someone else hit that person
[2:33:07] I want to tell you something a stranger
[2:33:11] but something in the heart of people
[2:33:14] that says I will risk my life you don't
[2:33:18] even have time to process that
[2:33:21] you because you so you can't produce
[2:33:23] that you can't manufacture that it has
[2:33:25] to be an overflow of who you are so you
[2:33:27] jump out in the middle of traffic
[2:33:32] and you're willing to try to prevent
[2:33:34] somebody else I want to tell you
[2:33:36] something that's love to me
[2:33:38] that's love
[2:33:42] if a man really hates you
[2:33:45] really hate you and he's proved he hates
[2:33:48] you and still in your heart you love him
[2:33:50] you're getting put pretty close to the
[2:33:53] kingdom that's right
[2:33:57] read it again without my Interruption if
[2:33:59] a man really hates you and he's proved
[2:34:02] he hates you and still in your heart you
[2:34:04] love him you're getting pretty close to
[2:34:06] the kingdom that's right
[2:34:12] all we can say is oh me
[2:34:16] we we can't really boldly say Amen even
[2:34:18] though we know it's a truth so we say so
[2:34:19] be it amen it's a truth but we can't all
[2:34:21] say Amen as though we produce that kind
[2:34:23] of character in the Earth
[2:34:26] you know he hates you he's proven that
[2:34:28] he hates you and you can love him anyway
[2:34:30] brother Graham said you're getting
[2:34:31] pretty close to the kingdom you know
[2:34:32] what that means you're getting pretty
[2:34:34] close to transformation
[2:34:36] that means you're getting pretty close
[2:34:37] to the stature of the perfect man who is
[2:34:39] the Lord Jesus Christ I hear people
[2:34:41] preach the message like brother Branham
[2:34:43] was the perfect man the perfect man that
[2:34:45] he was preaching about is the Lord Jesus
[2:34:47] Christ
[2:34:48] he said I am not a perfect man I make
[2:34:51] mistakes don't you take my word for it
[2:34:54] didn't he say it I make thousands of
[2:34:56] mistakes every day which by the way was
[2:34:59] a mistake
[2:35:04] nobody makes thousands of mistakes every
[2:35:06] day
[2:35:07] and certainly not brother Branham but he
[2:35:10] certainly made the point didn't he
[2:35:14] all of God's Sons must be the same to be
[2:35:16] the word word born of the word and
[2:35:18] spirit brings us back to the spoken word
[2:35:20] again I'm watching for the quote like in
[2:35:22] John 3 see to be born of the water and
[2:35:25] the spirit what does it do
[2:35:27] then it brings you right back again into
[2:35:29] the place of where you should have been
[2:35:31] in the beginning
[2:35:32] see that's the reason of Christ's death
[2:35:34] brings us right back again to where sons
[2:35:36] of God say message paragraph 181 give me
[2:35:40] the rest of my time if you will
[2:35:41] Hallelujah can you see the word takes
[2:35:44] flash there it is
[2:35:46] I want you to understand there it is the
[2:35:49] word takes flesh
[2:35:51] the word becomes flesh the word produces
[2:35:54] itself
[2:35:56] in a body of Flesh
[2:35:59] this is not a condescension it was the
[2:36:02] first time
[2:36:03] it was God coming down to be flesh
[2:36:06] this is not a condescension this is an
[2:36:09] Ascension when the word becomes flesh
[2:36:11] this time there will be an ascended
[2:36:13] people on the Earth not a condescended
[2:36:15] people you understand God Almighty had
[2:36:17] to come down to be in a fleshly body
[2:36:19] you've got to come up to be the word
[2:36:21] made flesh
[2:36:23] oh hear it
[2:36:24] [Applause]
[2:36:26] what's going to call you higher
[2:36:32] third seal
[2:36:37] can you see the word takes flesh there
[2:36:39] you are God is going to have a church
[2:36:42] it's going to be born of the word of God
[2:36:45] because it is
[2:36:48] the Living Word of God not the printed
[2:36:51] word
[2:36:53] not the magnetically recorded or
[2:36:55] captured word
[2:36:56] but that church is going to be the
[2:36:59] Living Word of God walking around in a
[2:37:03] body of Flesh
[2:37:03] [Music]
[2:37:07] anybody with me
[2:37:09] same message paragraph 277 we're
[2:37:11] hurrying we'll never finish this message
[2:37:13] I'm on page two
[2:37:16] I thought here I thought I'd come and
[2:37:18] get all 12 Pages done this morning and
[2:37:20] then and I didn't I should have known
[2:37:22] better
[2:37:23] now his body is will you so much time on
[2:37:25] collards oh come on
[2:37:27] sometimes your mind gets so wondered if
[2:37:29] I don't say something like that and
[2:37:31] bring you back
[2:37:35] now his body is to do the same because
[2:37:37] the body is head and body this is
[2:37:40] paragraph 277 spoken word
[2:37:48] now his body is to do the same
[2:37:51] because the body is head and body is
[2:37:55] together
[2:37:57] that right he's asking a question and
[2:38:00] I'd like I want you to see it if we can
[2:38:01] wait just a moment because
[2:38:03] it's one of those uh quotations where
[2:38:06] it's a little you know head and body and
[2:38:08] the same and body and head and and I'd
[2:38:10] like for you to see it I believe it's so
[2:38:12] much more effective so we'll just wait
[2:38:14] just a moment and uh and look at it
[2:38:17] three three paragraphs and I don't want
[2:38:20] you I want you to really see it in in
[2:38:22] print
[2:38:23] now his body is to do the same
[2:38:26] because the body is
[2:38:30] head and body is together that right if
[2:38:34] Christ is the head was the word
[2:38:38] his body has to be the same thing as his
[2:38:43] head was
[2:38:47] you said that right
[2:38:50] my body oh excuse me a church of the
[2:38:53] word
[2:38:54] a church of the word
[2:38:56] born of the word virgin born from the
[2:39:02] word
[2:39:03] that means all the denominational stuff
[2:39:05] even Church age stuff
[2:39:10] because each Church age picked up some
[2:39:12] fanaticism not the message not the
[2:39:16] message to the church age but every
[2:39:18] Church age picked up some fanaticism
[2:39:22] even laodicea even those around the
[2:39:25] message of brother Branham picked up
[2:39:27] some fanaticism
[2:39:30] [Music]
[2:39:32] and that bride who will be the
[2:39:34] manifested word of God she must stand
[2:39:36] wordbride only
[2:39:40] she cannot meet the Mandate of the hour
[2:39:43] with Shelley Doctrine
[2:39:48] it's only by the word
[2:39:51] that she'll be able to be what God has
[2:39:52] called her to be
[2:39:54] not denominational
[2:39:56] a church of the word born of the word
[2:39:59] virgin born from the word not
[2:40:00] denominational now virgin born from the
[2:40:03] word the way the body operates
[2:40:07] is how
[2:40:09] by the head he told us who the head is
[2:40:12] it's the word
[2:40:13] [Music]
[2:40:14] that right
[2:40:16] now he said my body can't move until my
[2:40:18] head tells it to move
[2:40:20] oh my
[2:40:24] oh my
[2:40:29] oh my think about this a little bit
[2:40:33] think about this in the order of the
[2:40:34] home
[2:40:41] think about how much more successful a
[2:40:44] home life can be
[2:40:48] if the recognized head of the home
[2:40:51] is the one who directs the movement
[2:40:56] you don't have to take a deep breath you
[2:40:58] don't have to sigh you don't have to
[2:41:00] panic
[2:41:02] I'm not about to beat the wives down I'm
[2:41:05] not about to beat the women down if
[2:41:07] there's one thing I despise around this
[2:41:11] truth
[2:41:13] is how women have been treated around
[2:41:16] this truth
[2:41:19] they are not senseless
[2:41:21] they are not empty heads
[2:41:26] they're valuable
[2:41:28] if you don't believe that my brother
[2:41:30] then you better ask Moses if his wife
[2:41:33] saved his life or not God's Mighty
[2:41:37] Prophet chosen for his hour Moses
[2:41:41] if it hadn't been for a for a pagan
[2:41:44] woman
[2:41:44] [Music]
[2:41:46] zephara a pagan woman
[2:41:50] said you've been a bloody husband to me
[2:41:52] [Music]
[2:41:55] his life was spared she said didn't you
[2:41:58] tell me there was a covenant
[2:42:01] didn't you tell me the foreskin of the
[2:42:03] male had to be taken off as a sign of a
[2:42:06] covenant with God
[2:42:08] then what are we doing with the
[2:42:09] generation of Hebrews with the with the
[2:42:11] foreskin still on
[2:42:13] that's why they're suffering
[2:42:19] in that moment it was vital for her not
[2:42:23] to be empty-handed
[2:42:25] but to DARE speak up
[2:42:30] you'll never have that problem as long
[2:42:33] as the head of the house
[2:42:35] stays under his head
[2:42:39] but if he gets distracted from following
[2:42:41] his head
[2:42:44] then a sister a wife may have to speak
[2:42:46] up and say hey
[2:42:49] it's also my job
[2:42:52] to protect the children
[2:42:55] and the family and so I'm going to stand
[2:42:57] up here the best way I know how honor
[2:43:00] you the best way I know how but tell you
[2:43:02] that something doesn't feel right about
[2:43:04] where we are right now something is a
[2:43:06] little bit out let's pray together
[2:43:09] and a man who resents it when it's done
[2:43:12] in the right Spirit has got a big
[2:43:14] problem
[2:43:17] yes
[2:43:20] Moses even Moses had to Humble himself
[2:43:24] but a home will flow much more fluid it
[2:43:28] will be a more successful and more
[2:43:31] peaceful
[2:43:32] when a man stays in subjection to his
[2:43:36] head and the wife also is in subjection
[2:43:39] to her head and a family of children
[2:43:42] subjected to their head God has an order
[2:43:47] well what if my head is flesh and my
[2:43:49] body is concrete huh
[2:43:52] can't move
[2:43:54] head can say move move move move move
[2:43:56] move but there's nothing to send a
[2:43:58] message to the body concrete
[2:44:01] is that right and congregation says amen
[2:44:03] he said well if my head is Christ you
[2:44:07] ought to hear this
[2:44:08] and my body is a denomination
[2:44:11] well we didn't do it that way in the
[2:44:13] Assembly of God we didn't do it that way
[2:44:15] in the Church of God we didn't do it
[2:44:17] that way in the Baptist we didn't do it
[2:44:19] that way in the in the manual holiness
[2:44:22] we didn't do it that way in the
[2:44:23] Presbyterian
[2:44:25] you you better get a body change
[2:44:28] because you'll not be able to submit and
[2:44:30] subject yourself to Christ as your head
[2:44:32] if you're going to continue to try to be
[2:44:34] a denominational body
[2:44:39] how is it going to work how can Purity
[2:44:41] oh
[2:44:46] how can Purity and a work together
[2:44:49] brother random tell us how you really
[2:44:50] felt about denominations
[2:44:55] why would he say such a thing because
[2:44:57] the Bible did
[2:44:58] where did they get that the Bible where
[2:45:00] did he get that description the Bible
[2:45:02] what book particularly The Book of
[2:45:04] Revelation
[2:45:06] the Bible calls the Catholic church that
[2:45:10] her daughters are harlots
[2:45:12] her daughters are denominationals
[2:45:15] who have taken upon themselves
[2:45:17] Blasphemous names in other words they
[2:45:20] call themselves The Church of God the
[2:45:22] Assembly of God the Church of Jesus
[2:45:24] Christ the the holy church of so and so
[2:45:28] they've taken on these names but their
[2:45:30] names are blasphemy because they are not
[2:45:32] married to the Head
[2:45:34] somebody said who is uh qualified to say
[2:45:37] such a thing this book
[2:45:39] is a road map
[2:45:43] and there's a whole lot of things going
[2:45:45] on that you can't trace to the word
[2:45:48] then the body has become concrete
[2:45:51] it's become and you can't lead a
[2:45:54] body
[2:45:55] even with a pure head
[2:45:57] there's got to be a transformation we
[2:46:00] are word born body we are word born
[2:46:03] bride anybody here
[2:46:06] he said I love it Brethren I'll tell you
[2:46:09] I like to preach on some of this a while
[2:46:10] the the way the body operates is by the
[2:46:13] head and the head is the word that right
[2:46:16] the head is the word so we are the word
[2:46:20] born body of Jesus Christ so that you
[2:46:23] will think not think so that you will
[2:46:25] not think
[2:46:26] that I am uh you know all against the
[2:46:29] church age book I am not
[2:46:31] I am only concerned about the places
[2:46:34] where there are things found in the
[2:46:37] church age book that cannot be found
[2:46:39] anywhere else in the message
[2:46:41] and my opinion is there were too many
[2:46:43] human hands
[2:46:45] on the book to call it exclusively
[2:46:48] brother branham's that's just my opinion
[2:46:51] he said in the church age book pergamian
[2:46:55] this is an important
[2:46:58] word but I have grounded this already in
[2:47:01] the spoken word is the Original Seed
[2:47:03] that's the reason I read those quotes he
[2:47:05] said but this Prophet will come and as
[2:47:07] the Forerunner to the first coming cried
[2:47:10] Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away
[2:47:12] the sin of the world even so will he no
[2:47:15] doubt cry out Behold the Lamb of God
[2:47:19] coming in glory
[2:47:23] he will do this
[2:47:26] for even as John was the messenger of
[2:47:29] Truth to the elect
[2:47:31] so is now you know that's very
[2:47:34] interesting because John was not one of
[2:47:37] the church age Messengers
[2:47:39] but John had a message that forerun the
[2:47:42] church ages because it foreign the first
[2:47:45] coming of Jesus Christ he preached
[2:47:47] Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away
[2:47:49] the sins of the world if you get a
[2:47:51] chance to see the first two episodes of
[2:47:53] season three of The Chosen you will
[2:47:55] you'll see John the Baptist again
[2:47:58] he's there again he's in prison
[2:48:02] no jealousy
[2:48:04] no resentment of what's going on
[2:48:07] he's thrilled
[2:48:10] he's thrilled
[2:48:11] yes maybe perhaps he believes he's going
[2:48:14] to be sprung
[2:48:17] but the truth is he's willing to fulfill
[2:48:19] his role whatever it is he rejoices to
[2:48:22] hear that the ministry of Jesus is
[2:48:24] successful
[2:48:27] he fulfilled his Commission
[2:48:29] he could not have been cut short from
[2:48:31] the earth had he not finished everything
[2:48:33] that God sent him to do
[2:48:36] remember that
[2:48:37] he did exactly what God sent him to do
[2:48:39] after his wilderness
[2:48:41] education
[2:48:43] he delivered one powerful sermon Behold
[2:48:46] the Lamb of God that taketh away the
[2:48:48] sins of the world brother Bram said even
[2:48:50] that messenger of Truth to the elect
[2:48:52] like John he will come and listen to
[2:48:54] what he said he would say even so will
[2:48:57] he no doubt cry out Behold the Lamb of
[2:48:59] God coming in glory
[2:49:01] Second Coming
[2:49:03] he will do this for even as John was the
[2:49:05] messenger of Truth to the elect so is
[2:49:08] the one so is this one the last
[2:49:10] Messenger to the elect and
[2:49:14] there she is word born bride
[2:49:18] stay with me just a moment
[2:49:20] in the seven Church ages I want to do
[2:49:22] two or three more quotations here in
[2:49:24] close
[2:49:27] we're not nearly where we want to be but
[2:49:29] we're moving in that direction
[2:49:32] in paragraph 211 of the seven Church
[2:49:35] ages
[2:49:36] he said watch it's the church speaking
[2:49:39] to him now
[2:49:41] Waters
[2:49:43] Revelation 17 15 said Waters means
[2:49:46] thickness and multitudes of peoples or
[2:49:50] people
[2:49:51] now his voice or this being that was
[2:49:54] standing there looking like this Christ
[2:49:56] in his church
[2:50:04] you want to read that next phrase
[2:50:06] anybody here
[2:50:08] you want to read that next phrase as
[2:50:10] bride and Christ being one like husband
[2:50:14] and wife is one
[2:50:16] the church and Christ being molded
[2:50:19] together with one person
[2:50:22] the same Holy Spirit
[2:50:26] somebody said why are you telling us
[2:50:28] this because this is who you are
[2:50:31] well I'm so defeated this is who you are
[2:50:34] defeat is not who you are a failure is
[2:50:37] not who you are
[2:50:39] all right Lord of Mercy I like to said
[2:50:42] something I don't think I've ever said
[2:50:43] in the pulpit
[2:50:49] I'm going to get as low as I can to say
[2:50:51] it
[2:50:52] this came to me and I'm going to say it
[2:50:53] a screw-up is not who you are
[2:50:59] the enemy has told somebody that you are
[2:51:02] not that
[2:51:05] and you may realize that today but Don't
[2:51:08] You Dare Forget it tomorrow
[2:51:10] Christ is his church as bride and Christ
[2:51:14] being one like husband and wife is one
[2:51:16] the church in Christ being molded
[2:51:18] together with one person the same Holy
[2:51:20] Spirit let's go on
[2:51:22] and the things that Christ did the
[2:51:25] church does also do you see it
[2:51:33] that beautiful Church there
[2:51:36] in holiness
[2:51:39] folks Holiness is still right
[2:51:43] a differentiation between male and
[2:51:46] female is still right if the Pentecostal
[2:51:49] Church hadn't quit preaching against
[2:51:51] women dressing like men
[2:51:54] if they would have made a greater stand
[2:51:56] for the truth knowing this is their
[2:51:58] truth
[2:52:00] this is their truth
[2:52:03] I was raised Assembly of God
[2:52:06] this was their truth
[2:52:10] my grandmother saved 1950.
[2:52:14] in the Assembly of God
[2:52:16] and they preached the riches off of her
[2:52:22] but the church started adapting
[2:52:27] was that funny
[2:52:29] with the time
[2:52:33] molding itself just like the world they
[2:52:37] said later years later they didn't know
[2:52:38] the word then but years later they said
[2:52:40] we want to be relevant
[2:52:43] no you want to fill up the building
[2:52:47] you want to fill up the offering plate
[2:52:53] why I have in my files I've told you
[2:52:56] this I have in my files uh bylaws that
[2:52:59] came from Headquarters Springfield
[2:53:00] Missouri where mixed bathing was sin
[2:53:06] says right there in the bylaws in the in
[2:53:09] the membership packet
[2:53:14] they also said that you couldn't be a
[2:53:17] mason or in a labor union
[2:53:21] they also said we don't go to movies or
[2:53:24] bowling alleys
[2:53:28] so they had all kinds of standards
[2:53:31] but they just get weaker and weaker I
[2:53:33] want to tell you something Holiness is
[2:53:34] still right
[2:53:36] and if you call what I preach legalism
[2:53:38] you are sadly mistaken and I'll tell you
[2:53:41] why if you don't make a stand somewhere
[2:53:46] [Music]
[2:53:47] now look at gender confusion
[2:53:50] I've told you before we cried out
[2:53:52] against Grace Jones wasn't that her name
[2:53:54] years ago the first black woman who
[2:53:57] dressed like a man who cut her hair like
[2:53:59] a man a pop star of her day
[2:54:02] and she called herself some kind of name
[2:54:04] I don't know what it was but she called
[2:54:07] herself some kind of name presenting
[2:54:09] herself as both male and female way back
[2:54:13] and now look what we've got today
[2:54:18] Kirk Cameron wrote a book about
[2:54:20] overcoming hardship with faith
[2:54:24] they called libraries from Northern
[2:54:27] California all the way across to to uh
[2:54:30] New Hampshire
[2:54:33] and ask would they be willing to host
[2:54:36] him at his expense
[2:54:39] to come into the library and read the
[2:54:41] book to whoever showed up and everyone
[2:54:44] not one
[2:54:46] not one of the libraries would let him
[2:54:49] come at his own expense and read his own
[2:54:52] book which he said is not overtly
[2:54:54] religious
[2:54:56] it only mentions faith
[2:54:58] and Faith helping you get through hard
[2:55:00] times not one of those public libraries
[2:55:03] you say well they've got to stay out of
[2:55:05] that kind of stuff the very same
[2:55:07] libraries
[2:55:08] have either already hosted or were
[2:55:12] scheduled had already scheduled hosting
[2:55:15] drag queens
[2:55:18] men dress like women reading books about
[2:55:22] tolerance and and pronouns gender
[2:55:25] pronoun neutrality
[2:55:28] come on
[2:55:30] the answer that some of the libraries
[2:55:33] wrote back said uh we are a force to to
[2:55:38] be more accepting of all cultures
[2:55:46] except Christian faith
[2:55:49] something's very very very very sadly
[2:55:52] wrong in our nation
[2:55:54] and I don't always blame the church for
[2:55:56] things but I want to tell you something
[2:55:58] the church has had a major part
[2:56:01] and not saying anything about women
[2:56:03] dressing like men and men dressing like
[2:56:05] women come on and now look at the mess
[2:56:08] we've got in Holiness and separation is
[2:56:11] Right modesty is right
[2:56:15] the Holy Ghost is not living in
[2:56:17] vulgarity
[2:56:18] he's living in purity
[2:56:21] come on and there should be no argument
[2:56:23] there should be absolutely no reason to
[2:56:25] even discuss the matter
[2:56:29] nobody should have to come and tell you
[2:56:31] to wear your skirt longer
[2:56:33] then shorter
[2:56:35] nobody should have to come and tell you
[2:56:38] those kinds of things about dropping
[2:56:40] necklines
[2:56:41] but we do have to
[2:56:43] because if we don't the world and the
[2:56:46] Fashion World and Hollywood
[2:56:48] and
[2:56:50] mail order catalog
[2:56:53] and JCPenney
[2:56:55] will teach women how to dress if the
[2:56:58] church doesn't preach if the if the
[2:57:00] messenger doesn't pray if the if the
[2:57:01] pastor doesn't tell it like it is then
[2:57:03] we're going to be following JCPenney
[2:57:05] we're going to be following Ralph Lauren
[2:57:07] we're going to be following Glory of
[2:57:09] Vanderbilt
[2:57:13] we see what she produced
[2:57:18] somebody has to make a stand so that
[2:57:20] beautiful Church there in holiness
[2:57:22] in power
[2:57:24] in Majesty
[2:57:26] with seeing visions
[2:57:33] someone said I would stream but but I
[2:57:35] can't stand it brother shell he's always
[2:57:37] promoting his visions
[2:57:39] folks
[2:57:41] looks
[2:57:44] if I ever stand there and read from the
[2:57:46] vision book
[2:57:48] the visions that I've experienced over
[2:57:50] the last 10 years
[2:57:52] you'll say you'll say he's a man of many
[2:57:54] visions
[2:57:56] but I have kept them and held them many
[2:57:59] of them most of them
[2:58:01] from my own church
[2:58:03] because I don't want to promote anything
[2:58:05] by my vision
[2:58:07] but I can at times not mention
[2:58:12] come on
[2:58:14] I can't mention that in I mean I cannot
[2:58:17] mention
[2:58:18] that in the night last night I was
[2:58:20] walking through 2032.
[2:58:25] I can't not mention that
[2:58:28] I said what year is this on Earth
[2:58:34] I've just come from there
[2:58:37] I I I I shocked myself out of it
[2:58:43] when the answer said it's 20 32.
[2:58:48] now all I can say I won't make any other
[2:58:50] I won't even tell the detail won't tell
[2:58:52] any more all else but I can say that for
[2:58:54] this little church you can you can now
[2:58:56] know that I I've not seen anything
[2:58:59] on Earth's time uh scale past 2032.
[2:59:04] don't you leave here and say some crazy
[2:59:06] thing
[2:59:07] I didn't say the Lord was coming in
[2:59:09] 2032. I didn't say anything like that
[2:59:12] I've seen many things in eternity yet to
[2:59:14] come
[2:59:15] but I know exactly what time it was on
[2:59:18] Earth and Earth was was still clunking
[2:59:21] along
[2:59:27] that beautiful Church there in Holiness
[2:59:29] and Power in Majesty was seeing Vision
[2:59:31] signs and wonders is that the rest of
[2:59:33] that one everything just like he did
[2:59:35] here it is on Earth giving all praise to
[2:59:37] God saying I can do not listen we need
[2:59:39] those things
[2:59:41] we need to serve a God who still talks
[2:59:45] who still shows his children something
[2:59:46] amen
[2:59:48] I I want to say to to so many out there
[2:59:51] why don't you see a vision
[2:59:54] why don't you dream a dream
[2:59:57] the Bible said in the last days all men
[3:00:00] will dream dreams young men will see
[3:00:02] Vision we don't base our faith on a
[3:00:04] dream or a vision
[3:00:06] but if the spirit of God is moving and
[3:00:08] you feel like we've already met the
[3:00:10] climax of the move of God then there
[3:00:12] ought to still be visions and dreams
[3:00:14] among the people
[3:00:15] and if you do if you do have them why
[3:00:17] would you shove them under a bushel
[3:00:21] why wouldn't you speak about them from
[3:00:22] time to time I can do nothing except the
[3:00:25] father shows me
[3:00:26] but he showed me and here it is and we
[3:00:30] come see these things go to taking place
[3:00:34] now Christ molded into one and the voice
[3:00:37] of many Waters
[3:00:39] many people
[3:00:42] I read all that just to get to this
[3:00:44] verse
[3:00:45] we are a word born bride
[3:00:49] and many Waters
[3:00:52] sounding with one United voice
[3:00:57] did you know the prophet said that the
[3:00:59] voice of the Resurrection will be in the
[3:01:01] bride
[3:01:03] which helps us to understand from the
[3:01:04] word that the bride will call
[3:01:07] for the resurrection of the Dead
[3:01:11] how will she do that because she'll have
[3:01:13] thus say the Lord and as you don't have
[3:01:14] the say the Lord she'll keep still
[3:01:17] how will she know when because
[3:01:20] she'll be following the lamb
[3:01:23] now Christ molded into one in the voice
[3:01:25] of many Waters musicians are beginning
[3:01:27] to come many people not just the one it
[3:01:31] was the whole church
[3:01:32] the seven churches molded together
[3:01:35] in one great ransomed body of the Lord
[3:01:41] anybody hear what we're saying this
[3:01:45] morning
[3:01:46] this morning
[3:01:50] and the last one for this morning
[3:01:55] this afternoon but we don't say this
[3:01:58] afternoon this afternoon but we do say
[3:02:00] this morning
[3:02:02] 152 same voice
[3:02:05] I want to remind you of the order of his
[3:02:07] coming
[3:02:09] now it's the first thing is the sounding
[3:02:12] the first thing and and he misspeaks he
[3:02:15] corrects it so I'm going to just skip
[3:02:16] that part he said the first thing a
[3:02:18] shout
[3:02:20] and then a voice
[3:02:22] and then a trumpet
[3:02:25] shout a messenger getting the people
[3:02:28] ready
[3:02:30] the second is a voice of the
[3:02:33] Resurrection
[3:02:37] and what does he say about the voice of
[3:02:39] the Resurrection he says the same voice
[3:02:43] not one not one person
[3:02:46] he said just a moment ago it's many
[3:02:47] Waters
[3:02:49] but the same voice
[3:02:52] one with the bridegroom that's how the
[3:02:54] bride can speak and it be thus saith the
[3:02:57] Lord that's how the bride can move and
[3:02:58] it be thus saith the Lord that's how the
[3:03:00] bride can create
[3:03:03] by the spoken word of her mouth because
[3:03:05] it's not her voice
[3:03:07] it's his voice
[3:03:08] he said this uh shout a messenger
[3:03:10] getting people ready the second is the
[3:03:12] voice of the Resurrection the same voice
[3:03:13] that a loud voice same voice in Saint
[3:03:16] John 11 38-44 that called Lazarus from
[3:03:19] the grave the same voice that called
[3:03:21] Lazarus from the grave that same voice
[3:03:23] one of these days is going to speak out
[3:03:25] of the bride of Christ and the dead in
[3:03:27] Christ are going to rise up
[3:03:30] somebody said I thought that was Gabriel
[3:03:32] blowing his trumpet yeah that's what the
[3:03:34] denominations think
[3:03:35] that didn't want the word said
[3:03:42] getting the bride together what is that
[3:03:44] getting the bride together go with it
[3:03:46] goes it follows right after the same
[3:03:48] voice like calling Lazarus from the
[3:03:50] grave getting the bride together and
[3:03:52] then the resurrection of the Dead see
[3:03:55] to be caught up with it
[3:03:57] now watch the three things takes place
[3:03:59] the next is what was a trumpet a voice
[3:04:02] and then he goes back he's going to get
[3:04:04] it right now a shout
[3:04:06] a voice
[3:04:07] a trumpet
[3:04:12] this would be a perfect opportunity for
[3:04:14] me to tell you that there are times that
[3:04:16] brother Branham is trying to go back and
[3:04:18] pick up where he was
[3:04:20] and this is a perfect example
[3:04:23] of a
[3:04:25] Body Soul spirit
[3:04:28] Body Spirit Soul situation
[3:04:31] now surely you don't think that the
[3:04:34] order is changed from the Bible
[3:04:37] surely you don't think the order has
[3:04:38] changed from the Bible here either a
[3:04:41] shout
[3:04:42] a voice and a trumpet
[3:04:46] if you happen to be listening and he
[3:04:47] says a Trumpeter shout of voice you
[3:04:49] understand he just misspoke he didn't
[3:04:51] change his Doctrine
[3:04:53] and how do we know which is right he
[3:04:55] told us I'll go to the word so if you
[3:04:58] want to know the order of Body Spirit
[3:04:59] and so you go to the word Body Spirit
[3:05:02] soul
[3:05:05] Body Soul
[3:05:07] Spirit see how easy it is to do it
[3:05:10] now watch the three things take place
[3:05:12] the next is what of a shout a voice a
[3:05:15] trumpet
[3:05:17] now the third thing is a trumpet which
[3:05:20] always at the Feast of trumpets is
[3:05:22] calling the people to the feast and that
[3:05:24] will be the bride's supper the Lamb's
[3:05:27] supper with the bride in the sky
[3:05:31] what if I told you according to that
[3:05:33] word
[3:05:38] what if I told you the shout has gone
[3:05:40] out
[3:05:42] if you ever hear somebody say the or
[3:05:44] hear me say the Rapture is in progress
[3:05:46] that's what I mean the shout's already
[3:05:48] gone out we're living in the day now of
[3:05:51] the voice of the archangel
[3:05:53] that's where we are right now
[3:05:55] we're in the days of the same voice
[3:05:58] and one of these days there's going to
[3:06:00] be a final trumpet the last Trump the
[3:06:02] one that causes the bride to leave here
[3:06:05] with the bride that has been resurrected
[3:06:07] from the dead caught up together to meet
[3:06:09] the Lord in the air and we go right up
[3:06:11] to the bride supper
[3:06:12] how many of you are looking for the
[3:06:13] bride supper let's stand together I used
[3:06:16] all my time and and some more
[3:06:21] but I'm doing this to show you
[3:06:25] that brother Branham saw his mission as
[3:06:27] for running the coming word
[3:06:30] and to tell you that you are a part of
[3:06:33] the coming word that brother Branham was
[3:06:37] for running
[3:06:38] you are a part of the coming word you
[3:06:42] are a part of that which he was for
[3:06:45] running
[3:06:46] somebody said well I don't feel like
[3:06:48] that and I don't always manifest that
[3:06:50] and I just always I get it
[3:06:54] we're fighting
[3:06:56] what kind of battle
[3:07:05] if you follow the word order
[3:07:07] you'll know where the battle is it's in
[3:07:09] the soul
[3:07:11] your spirit has been regenerated by the
[3:07:14] spirit of Jesus Christ your spirit is
[3:07:16] secure
[3:07:18] you are Spirit of his spirit
[3:07:21] Same Spirit
[3:07:22] same Holy Spirit
[3:07:24] your old Spirit has been Rewritten
[3:07:27] regenerated and a new spirit now lives
[3:07:29] within you the spirit of Jesus Christ no
[3:07:32] struggle in your spirit
[3:07:34] the struggle is in the personality which
[3:07:36] we sometimes refer to as a spirit and I
[3:07:39] think sometimes people around the
[3:07:40] message make that same mistake they'll
[3:07:42] say my he has an awful Spirit no
[3:07:45] he may very well have the spirit of
[3:07:47] Christ you're calling a spirit a
[3:07:49] personality and your human spirit is not
[3:07:52] your personality
[3:07:53] your personality flows out of your soul
[3:07:56] life not your spirit life
[3:07:59] your soul life is mine will and emotions
[3:08:02] that's where you get the most trouble
[3:08:04] anybody ought to know that it's in the
[3:08:06] mind it's in your will your stubbornness
[3:08:09] my stubbornness
[3:08:11] it's in the emotions
[3:08:14] we spend a lot of our life reacting how
[3:08:17] emotionally not intelligently and not
[3:08:19] spiritually
[3:08:23] if we if we manifest it according to the
[3:08:26] body we'd use our intellect
[3:08:28] if we manifested according to the spirit
[3:08:30] we'd let the Holy Spirit teach us how
[3:08:33] but rather we often respond anybody
[3:08:36] guilty
[3:08:37] we often respond out of our emotions
[3:08:41] which causes us to condemn ourselves
[3:08:45] which causes us to disqualify ourselves
[3:08:48] which causes us to come to church on a
[3:08:50] Sunday morning and bring all our stuff
[3:08:52] with us
[3:08:55] but you just let a little word come a
[3:08:57] little reminder come and watch those
[3:08:59] people
[3:09:02] you're amazing
[3:09:05] your people are amazing
[3:09:08] you don't always respond that quickly
[3:09:11] but this morning you resp this morning
[3:09:14] you responded quickly quickly
[3:09:17] quickly
[3:09:19] and you began to do
[3:09:21] if you did it for your pastor thank you
[3:09:23] so much
[3:09:25] but you won't always do it for me
[3:09:28] regardless of why you started you
[3:09:31] started doing what you were created to
[3:09:33] do
[3:09:35] some pounded a little bit
[3:09:37] they felt a little called out and picked
[3:09:39] on but the truth is I didn't know who
[3:09:40] you were
[3:09:43] sometimes it's better just to leave
[3:09:45] people thinking you know
[3:09:48] even if you don't know
[3:09:50] all I knew was there's no way we could
[3:09:52] go forward in a service with all that
[3:09:54] swirl
[3:09:55] I knew that Benjamin would feel defeated
[3:09:57] and the musicians would feel defeated
[3:09:59] and I'd get up here to preach and go
[3:10:00] home feeling defeated there was enough
[3:10:03] of a swirl around us but look what you
[3:10:05] did
[3:10:07] you got out of your condemnation you
[3:10:10] pulled yourself out of your distraction
[3:10:12] and you began to be that word
[3:10:16] that was spoken that you would be you
[3:10:19] begin to be that you begin to come
[3:10:20] before the Lord worshiping his name
[3:10:24] and who'd have ever thought that an old
[3:10:26] hymn would bring us into the crescendo
[3:10:29] How Great Thou Art
[3:10:32] and here we are feeling like a bunch of
[3:10:34] little peons just tiny tiny little
[3:10:37] specks and all of a sudden we start
[3:10:39] beholding the goodness and greatness of
[3:10:41] our God and he peoples us right up and
[3:10:44] we start seeing ourselves as his whoa
[3:10:46] I'm his
[3:10:48] hey don't mess with me I'll call Papa
[3:10:52] are you careful how you treat me I'll go
[3:10:54] tell Daddy on you
[3:10:56] come on
[3:10:58] and when you do that you start seeing
[3:11:00] that the enemy is not your brother
[3:11:05] the enemy is not your sister
[3:11:09] [Music]
[3:11:11] the enemy is that voice in your head
[3:11:16] because we often become the weapon
[3:11:19] that is formed against ourselves may God
[3:11:23] give us Grace and Deliver Us from that
[3:11:24] it's a very exciting time
[3:11:27] most of the time we can't get up above
[3:11:29] our circumstances to find out just how
[3:11:31] exciting it is but God bless every one
[3:11:35] of you here today who got up above
[3:11:38] who who soared above and I pray that
[3:11:41] you've had a feast because of it and if
[3:11:44] you have it was him
[3:11:46] it was him it's all him it's all him you
[3:11:51] ready
[3:11:52] it's all him
[3:11:57] we need not think I I remember the years
[3:12:04] that I would meet Benjamin
[3:12:07] after a service defeated
[3:12:12] just couldn't get them but the truth is
[3:12:13] it wasn't everybody
[3:12:15] it was the influence of a handful it was
[3:12:18] the influence of a role
[3:12:21] that affected and shifted the identity
[3:12:24] of a whole body of people
[3:12:27] but you take it so personal
[3:12:30] he did just like I do
[3:12:33] you take it so personal
[3:12:35] and then we discovered
[3:12:37] many times we discovered that we
[3:12:39] shouldn't let a minority
[3:12:41] create the atmosphere
[3:12:43] and we press through anyway
[3:12:46] and that's what we have to do even even
[3:12:48] like times like today
[3:12:51] oh is there anything in here to worry
[3:12:53] over
[3:12:54] uh brother Auburn you sisters Theresa
[3:12:55] got anything to worry about
[3:13:01] anybody else got anything to be
[3:13:02] concerned about let me see hand Michael
[3:13:04] oh
[3:13:10] Michael's toting my load and yours too
[3:13:14] but he didn't stop him
[3:13:17] he left a wife at home all woozy koozy
[3:13:21] came on over here and got right up front
[3:13:24] he didn't wait on you
[3:13:27] come right on up front to do what he was
[3:13:29] created to do I'm not trying to pick on
[3:13:31] anybody
[3:13:32] or call anybody out or single anybody
[3:13:34] out I'm just telling you we take a lot
[3:13:36] of this for granted
[3:13:40] you don't get the text you don't get the
[3:13:42] calls you don't have the conversation
[3:13:43] sometimes that I have in a week and so
[3:13:46] you may not really know the load
[3:13:49] that somebody on the other end of your
[3:13:51] Pew is going through
[3:13:56] It Ain't Easy for them either
[3:13:58] but we cannot let that clip our wings
[3:14:05] we were created to soar above it all
[3:14:12] one of the things the spirit of God was
[3:14:14] rebuking this morning in that time was
[3:14:16] fear driving fear out of this place
[3:14:20] there's no room for fear and faith
