[54:24] he doesn't mind me saying that

[54:30] now three and one on the way we are so
[54:34] good so glad it's so good to see you all
[54:37] again God bless
[54:40] [Applause]
[54:45] you um Jeff would it be all right if we
[54:48] let uh sister dla just say something is
[54:51] that okay with you as her as her husband
[54:54] take the mic back there she she's never
[54:57] had an opportunity to give a little
[55:00] portion of her testimony but I heard her
[55:02] give it in another church and I don't
[55:05] want to put her on the spot too much but
[55:08] this is their 10-e anniversary of
[55:10] visiting it's been so long where do you
[55:13] all live
[55:14] now we live in Cambridge Ontario in
[55:17] Canada in Ontario for a while you were
[55:19] traveling around a little bit though
[55:21] weren't you in a bus or something uh yes
[55:23] so when Noah was born a couple of months
[55:26] after after we moved into an RV and we
[55:28] rented our home because our desire was
[55:30] to live out in the country and so we
[55:34] drove our RV to brother Dale loff's Farm
[55:38] he's a pastor and he's also a beef
[55:41] cattle farmer So within about a month of
[55:44] us being there the RV flooded oh and we
[55:47] moved into his office with the newborn
[55:51] so wow um we did try for quite a few
[55:54] years to
[55:57] to find a place to live we tried renting
[56:00] we tried to buy several homes and
[56:02] everything kept falling apart um so we
[56:05] saw that God was closing a lot of doors
[56:08] at that time in that area so anyway it
[56:10] led us back to Hamilton altario which is
[56:14] close to Cambridge um we ended up living
[56:16] with Jeff's parents for a while we ended
[56:18] up renting another home in Hamilton
[56:21] eventually we moved back in to the
[56:23] original home in Cambridge uh just a
[56:26] about 4 months before we had our second
[56:28] son so and what's interesting is what's
[56:32] L us here is that we now have our house
[56:34] up for sale that's in Cambridge so we
[56:37] feel the Lord leading us again uh to
[56:40] move out to the country we found our
[56:41] dream home
[56:42] so because we cleaned the home and
[56:45] staged it we thought it would be best to
[56:48] go somewhere for about a week while they
[56:49] show the house is it can be challenging
[56:52] with little ones to continually uh keep
[56:55] the house for so we Jeff said you know
[56:58] what dma why don't we go to Alabama and
[57:01] I said that would be the most precious
[57:04] gift to me because 10 years ago
[57:06] yesterday I was saved in this church um
[57:10] I grew up in a Muslim home and my entire
[57:12] family is
[57:13] Muslim and 10 years ago God started
[57:18] giving me visions of going to church
[57:21] praise the Lord and around that time um
[57:23] Betty oilon my husband's grandmother was
[57:26] is very ill and he said dla would like
[57:29] us to go to Alabama to for you to meet
[57:32] her before she passes and at the time we
[57:35] had no children and so we did a road
[57:37] trip out here with our German Shepherd
[57:39] and we arrived Saturday evening at the
[57:42] McGregor's house and they said tomorrow
[57:46] we're going to church and you're more
[57:48] than welcome to come however if you'd
[57:51] rather go to the flea market there's a
[57:53] great flea market you can check out too
[57:55] whatever is you know whatever you prefer
[57:57] and so that night I told Jeff I'm like I
[57:59] would love to go to church and he his
[58:02] jaw nearly hit the floor but uh we came
[58:05] here and I think right at the beginning
[58:08] I said you know I knew there was a God
[58:09] but I didn't have a name for him and I
[58:12] said God you know you just you have your
[58:14] way I I felt uncomfortable because I
[58:17] never been in a church and the worship
[58:19] started I didn't know what to do but the
[58:21] third song in was How Great Thou Art and
[58:24] wow when that started playing God just
[58:27] he took a hold of my heart and I said
[58:30] how do I know this song and I just
[58:32] started singing for my soul and I
[58:34] remember that a few weeks ago my
[58:35] friend's grandmother died and they
[58:37] handed out these song books to everybody
[58:39] there and they had us sing How Great
[58:41] Thou Art because she was a Christian and
[58:43] my mom even had the book in her hands
[58:45] and she was sitting right beside me so
[58:48] from that moment God had my heart and
[58:50] wow I knew I was going to be baptized
[58:53] and so I spoke to my parents about it
[58:56] and on October 14th of 2014 was when I
[58:59] was baptized in his name God praise I've
[59:01] never looked back and now I'm blessed
[59:04] with this beautiful family serving him
[59:06] and I'm so happy to be here praise the
[59:08] Lord how wonderful God bless
[59:14] you praise the
[59:16] [Music]
[59:18] Lord what a wonderful surprise we're
[59:21] very glad to have this young brother
[59:23] with us also God bless you you're
[59:25] welcome and I don't know if you could
[59:27] hear Ben it almost sounded like he was
[59:31] mumbling you were you probably it could
[59:35] have been the muffling muffled uh
[59:36] speaker but uh today you know brother
[59:40] Brent and sister Trish have visited us
[59:43] several times but now the real adventure
[59:47] begins they get to experience what some
[59:50] of you experienced when you started this
[59:53] way a long time ago there's just
[59:55] something about Alabama that can be very
[59:57] difficult and uh you have to break
[59:59] through it and you have to uh you need a
[1:00:02] lot of prayer and a lot of lifting up
[1:00:04] and of course we didn't tell them all
[1:00:06] that till they got
[1:00:07] here but we are very happy to have them
[1:00:10] and Joseph here for their first official
[1:00:12] Sunday and they're looking for a
[1:00:14] permanent place to live and sister Trish
[1:00:17] has a job and brother Brent will have
[1:00:19] one eventually but right now he's got a
[1:00:21] job uh taking care of Joseph and going
[1:00:24] back to get their stuff
[1:00:26] and so we want to uh join Ben and and
[1:00:30] making sure that you all know what we're
[1:00:32] announcing they they have officially
[1:00:34] landed and we're very very happy to have
[1:00:36] them this morning very happy very
[1:00:40] [Applause]
[1:00:40] [Music]

[1:07:54] who were here yesterday I tried to get
[1:07:57] around to most of you who didn't know
[1:07:59] brother Anthony to to thank you for
[1:08:02] making the extra effort to come uh their
[1:08:05] their many of their friends there was a

[1:08:14] blessed there was one of the gentlemen
[1:08:16] who said I'm a Nazarene too but you sang
[1:08:19] my favorite song so I felt right at home
[1:08:22] and we just appreciated the presence of
[1:08:24] the Lord that came and I know it was a
[1:08:26] sacrifice for you to come and it's
[1:08:29] awkward and not necessarily knowing
[1:08:31] someone but you really made it a very
[1:08:34] special uh Memorial and it meant a lot
[1:08:37] to Sister Cindy as I said earlier and we
[1:08:39] appreciate you for doing that so much
[1:08:41] and we look forward to being able to see

[1:12:24] following week we Colossians chapter
[1:12:28] 3 beginning in verse 5 through 10
[1:12:34] mortify that means ultimately
[1:12:38] kill Therefore your
[1:12:40] members which are upon the Earth
[1:12:43] fornication
[1:12:45] uncleanness inordinate affection evil
[1:12:48] concupisent and covetousness which is
[1:12:51] idolatry for which thing sake the wrath
[1:12:54] of God cometh on the children of
[1:12:58] disobedience in the which he also walked
[1:13:01] sometime these are from the original
[1:13:03] notes when ye lived in them but now ye
[1:13:08] also put off all these anger anybody get
[1:13:14] angry wrath malice blasphemy filthy
[1:13:19] communication out of your mouth watch
[1:13:22] your mouth lie not one to to another
[1:13:26] that's important tell the truth even if
[1:13:29] it hurts you're God's kids now you've
[1:13:33] got to live like God's children now we
[1:13:35] have to seeing that you put that you
[1:13:38] have put off the old man with his deeds
[1:13:40] and have put on the new man praise God
[1:13:43] which is renewed in knowledge after the
[1:13:46] image of him that created him I want to
[1:13:50] read that in the Amplified and if you'll
[1:13:52] remain standing we'll ask the Lord to
[1:13:54] bless our time in a moment so killed
[1:13:57] deaden deprive of power the evil desire
[1:14:01] lurking in your members that's your base
[1:14:05] nature that's the adamic nature that's
[1:14:07] the sinful nature when brother Brandon
[1:14:10] was preaching on that he drew two hearts
[1:14:12] on the board he said I'm not an artist
[1:14:15] I'll read that to you later he said I'm
[1:14:16] not an artist but he he drew two hearts
[1:14:19] on the board in one he put a little bird
[1:14:21] a little dove in one he put a snake and
[1:14:24] he talked about about that being the
[1:14:26] nature of the inner man and he said if
[1:14:30] that serpent is there hasn't been run
[1:14:33] off then you're going to have all these
[1:14:35] works of the flesh present once you get
[1:14:38] rid of him once you mortify that sinful
[1:14:42] nature there's another nature that comes
[1:14:45] and lives inside of you it's not your
[1:14:47] life anymore you're now bought with a
[1:14:49] price and the life that you now live the
[1:14:52] Apostle said is the life of Jesus Christ
[1:14:55] is that right so killed deaden deprive
[1:14:57] of power the evil desire lurking in your
[1:15:00] members those animal impulses and all
[1:15:03] that is Earthly in you that is employed
[1:15:06] in sin sexual vice impurity sensual
[1:15:10] appetites Unholy desires and all greed
[1:15:13] and
[1:15:14] covetousness for that is idolatry the
[1:15:17] deifying the deifying of self and other
[1:15:22] created things instead of God that's
[1:15:25] what idolatry is did you know it's not
[1:15:27] doesn't have to be your your your
[1:15:29] companion or your automobile or your job
[1:15:32] that you make an idol out of sometimes
[1:15:34] we make ourselves the idol right and we
[1:15:38] take better self better care of
[1:15:40] ourselves than we do the things of God
[1:15:43] and the apostles said this was going on
[1:15:45] in the first church age how much more
[1:15:48] could we expect that it be happening
[1:15:50] around us in the last Church age but how
[1:15:54] many of you know God got a remedy for
[1:15:56] that snake in your heart he's got
[1:15:58] another life all together that he's
[1:16:01] pouring into his sons it is on account
[1:16:04] of these very sins that the holy anger
[1:16:07] of God is ever coming upon the sons of
[1:16:09] Disobedience those who are obstinately
[1:16:12] you know what that word obstinate about
[1:16:14] don't you
[1:16:16] stubbornness obstinately opposed to the
[1:16:19] Divine will you were born with something
[1:16:23] that is obstinately opposed to the
[1:16:26] Divine will of God and you're the only
[1:16:29] person that can kill that thing you're
[1:16:31] the only person that can crucify that
[1:16:33] thing your husband can't do it for you
[1:16:36] your wife can't do it for you your
[1:16:37] preacher can't do it for you a prophet
[1:16:40] can't do it for you you're the one who
[1:16:42] has to put that old man to death amen
[1:16:45] but as soon as you do guess what you've
[1:16:47] got a new man you've got a new life that
[1:16:51] comes rushing in among whom you also
[1:16:54] once walk don't forget those of us who
[1:16:57] have been delivered from the nature of
[1:16:58] sin sometimes we get a little bride
[1:17:01] Pride going on and we need to remember
[1:17:04] that in one moment we could fall beneath
[1:17:07] the load of all that junk it's only by
[1:17:10] the grace of the master that we keep
[1:17:12] walking upright amen it's not our
[1:17:16] goodness so we also were living in and
[1:17:20] addicted to such practices there's just
[1:17:22] no doubt about that and have clothed
[1:17:25] yourselves now praise God but now put
[1:17:28] away and rid yourselves completely of
[1:17:31] all these things anger rage bad feeling
[1:17:34] toward others you've never had that have
[1:17:37] you curses and slander and foulmouthed
[1:17:41] abuse and shameful utterances from your
[1:17:45] lips do not lie to one another for you
[1:17:49] have stripped off the old unregenerate
[1:17:52] self with its evil practic es and have
[1:17:56] clothed yourself come on with the new
[1:18:00] spiritual self the new life which is uh
[1:18:03] ever in the process of being renewed and
[1:18:07] remolded into Fuller and more perfect
[1:18:09] knowledge upon knowledge after the image
[1:18:13] the likeness of him who Hallelujah who
[1:18:17] created it how many of you are glad that
[1:18:20] we are being constantly renewed into a
[1:18:23] new image
[1:18:25] and that is the image of Jesus Christ
[1:18:28] praise God we've put off the old man and
[1:18:32] we've put on the new man and as the old
[1:18:35] song said it's the best thing I've ever
[1:18:37] done is when I put off that old man
[1:18:41] father thank you today for your great
[1:18:44] grace and mercy that is upon us as we
[1:18:48] approach your word today we need your
[1:18:50] strength we need your courage and we

[1:19:05] and underneath your word today we want
[1:19:08] to be moldable and pliable we want you
[1:19:11] to come with your acts and and lay it to
[1:19:15] the root of all bitterness and all
[1:19:18] carnality that would remain in us and we
[1:19:21] want the life of Jesus Christ to spring
[1:19:25] forth and to to produce Bountiful fruit
[1:19:30] abundant fruit in our lives we want to
[1:19:33] be a star as your Prophet said the
[1:19:36] little bride would be we don't want to
[1:19:38] be country music stars or pop stars or
[1:19:42] TV stars but we want to be stars who
[1:19:45] shine with the light of the Glorious
[1:19:49] Gospel of Jesus Christ illuminate us
[1:19:52] with who you are and help us to
[1:19:55] ultimately kill all that is unlike you
[1:20:00] we want to drive the serpent completely
[1:20:04] out of our lives and we want to be
[1:20:06] governed by the Holy Spirit May the dove

[1:20:56] point to be with us today and and we're
[1:20:59] we're very grateful for that we are
[1:21:01] coming to an end soon of a series where
[1:21:05] we were talking about uh this this
[1:21:09] Frozen love because iniquity shall
[1:21:12] abound the Bible said because iniquity
[1:21:15] shall abound the love of many shall wax
[1:21:18] cold it shall become Frozen and you know
[1:21:21] if something had life in it and it's
[1:21:23] frozen uh quite often then it's
[1:21:26] paralyzed it can't it can't move it
[1:21:29] can't produce and we don't want that to
[1:21:32] be the case with our love we want to be
[1:21:35] passionately in love with Jesus Christ
[1:21:39] we don't want a head knowledge come on
[1:21:41] now we want a heart knowledge and it's
[1:21:44] not about religion because religion is
[1:21:49] vile religion is vile religion is stuffy
[1:21:54] but
[1:21:56] relationship is is your destiny if
[1:21:59] you're a part of the bride of Christ
[1:22:00] you're not called to a religious order
[1:22:02] you're called to a close and passionate
[1:22:05] relationship with Jesus Christ amen so
[1:22:09] don't settle for anything else it's not
[1:22:12] about just keeping a set of rules or
[1:22:14] standards it's about falling in love
[1:22:17] with him and when you fall in love with
[1:22:20] him you're going to love other people
[1:22:22] you're particularly going to love those
[1:22:24] who are of the household of faith the
[1:22:26] Bible said but your love is not going to
[1:22:29] be uh uh limited only to people who have
[1:22:33] tasted what you've tasted you're going
[1:22:35] to love a world that's lost and broken
[1:22:39] and dying and going to hell and you're
[1:22:42] going to want to tell them the truth and
[1:22:44] you're going to want to do it in love
[1:22:46] you're not going to want to do it with
[1:22:48] legalism or with religious talk you're
[1:22:50] going to want to do it with your life
[1:22:53] how many of you know your life is your
[1:22:55] biggest
[1:22:56] testimony amen the way you live in front
[1:22:59] of other people and and you better be
[1:23:02] careful because some people know you and
[1:23:04] you don't know
[1:23:07] them we a few weeks ago I I mean you
[1:23:10] know I don't post every problem I have
[1:23:14] uh for prayer because I ask you to pray
[1:23:16] for us I hope you do but we have
[1:23:18] problems too you know we have septic
[1:23:21] tank problems and air conditioning
[1:23:23] problems and uh automobile problems
[1:23:27] sometime few weeks ago went to put
[1:23:30] something in the refrigerator and it had
[1:23:33] died I don't mean it was on the blink I
[1:23:35] mean it was graveyard
[1:23:39] dead and uh you know so we go and uh the
[1:23:43] girl who cuts my hair she said well I go
[1:23:45] to Daniel and I used to go to Daniel
[1:23:47] years ago um but somehow the big box
[1:23:50] stores sometime make it easier and we
[1:23:52] just started popping in there but we
[1:23:54] went to Daniel and walked in the door
[1:23:57] and met met a lady that used to visit
[1:24:00] the church years ago and had a nice
[1:24:02] reunion with her and here come a
[1:24:04] Salesman walking over and and uh we
[1:24:07] don't have a lot of time for small talk
[1:24:09] we tell him we're in a hurry we got the
[1:24:10] whole family we've got the whole family
[1:24:13] with us we we we moved in there like The
[1:24:15] Brady Bunch or something and he looked
[1:24:18] at us kind of funny like do you have to
[1:24:20] have the you know everybody when you're
[1:24:22] refrigerator is an important piece of
[1:24:26] furniture how many of you know that's
[1:24:28] what keeps the grocery School ask
[1:24:31] Brother David his one out just a few
[1:24:33] days ago they know what it's like and so
[1:24:36] we we start negotiating and we we're
[1:24:39] looking at two different models and one
[1:24:41] of them is it's Swanky I mean to tell
[1:24:43] you it'll run it it's almost as though
[1:24:46] it will leave the house and go to the
[1:24:48] grocery store fill itself and come back
[1:24:51] I said I think that's a little more
[1:24:53] refrigerator than we need need but my
[1:24:55] wife you know my wife you know wives she
[1:24:58] said well what's the difference in the
[1:25:00] price oh just $1,000 I said no no no no
[1:25:04] no no no no no how many of you remember
[1:25:07] when refrigerators big ones didn't cost
[1:25:09] that much less be the difference so
[1:25:12] what's the diff no difference what's the
[1:25:14] difference in the motor no difference
[1:25:16] what's the difference in the in in the
[1:25:18] you know the power all all is it going
[1:25:20] to cool the yeah going to cool the same
[1:25:22] these are just bells and whistles and
[1:25:24] the reality is he said to us you're
[1:25:27] going to get 8 to 10 years on it I
[1:25:29] saidou kidding me he said ' no we don't
[1:25:32] promise anybody it doesn't matter how
[1:25:33] much you pay for it if you get 8 to 10
[1:25:36] years out of a refrigerator you're doing
[1:25:41] good you know I I wasn't
[1:25:45] happy I I'm so glad I didn't act ugly
[1:25:48] I'm glad I didn't stop my foot because
[1:25:51] after we've negotiated the price and we
[1:25:53] go in and we sit down to try to uh to uh
[1:25:57] come up with the money you know they do
[1:25:59] want the money and we're in there
[1:26:01] figuring out what card to put it on and
[1:26:04] the man says well I guess I'll tell you
[1:26:06] now I I know you I know you're a pastor
[1:26:09] I know some people in your church and so
[1:26:11] forth you know I was so glad that I was
[1:26:15] nice you don't ever know you want to
[1:26:19] live your life for Christ uh on a Monday
[1:26:23] just like you would any other day of the
[1:26:25] week because people are watching you and
[1:26:29] people know you whether you know them or
[1:26:32] not so we want to shine like the stars
[1:26:35] for Jesus Christ amen we have made our
[1:26:39] way through some of the
[1:26:41] behaviors of familiar spirits that's
[1:26:44] what we've been working on together
[1:26:46] especially those familiar spirits that
[1:26:49] like to operate through through an
[1:26:52] ancestrial line
[1:26:55] uh which the Bible we don't have to go
[1:26:57] back and ground all this we've grounded
[1:26:59] it already in the word these Spirits
[1:27:02] like to hang around families and they
[1:27:05] like to attack
[1:27:07] generations and they like to move from
[1:27:09] one generation to the next with their
[1:27:12] with their ugliness and we just believe
[1:27:14] that according to the word of God we
[1:27:16] don't have to be under that curse
[1:27:18] generation after generation the blood of
[1:27:21] Jesus is sufficient the name of Jes
[1:27:24] Jesus is sufficient the word of God is
[1:27:27] sufficient come on to use against the
[1:27:30] enemy and to break that curse so we have
[1:27:34] made our way down to to uh some of the
[1:27:36] last characteristics and the last time
[1:27:39] we were together you were you were
[1:27:42] blessed to have a guest speaker two
[1:27:45] services in a row so we're coming back
[1:27:48] to this this morning and we made our way
[1:27:50] to selfish ambition I'd like for you to
[1:27:53] put the definition of selfish ambition
[1:27:56] up one more time and let's look at that
[1:27:59] together how many of you are with me
[1:28:00] this morning selfish ambition focusing
[1:28:04] on one's own self personal wants and
[1:28:09] desires while trying to get ahead of
[1:28:13] others sounds like a little
[1:28:16] competition sounds like a little
[1:28:18] emulation going on come on wanting to
[1:28:21] get ahead of the Joneses you know amen
[1:28:25] someone gets a new vehicle I got to get
[1:28:26] a new vehicle whether I can afford it or
[1:28:29] not do you understand that's not the way
[1:28:31] you make purchases folks because you do
[1:28:34] have to pay for them eventually right
[1:28:36] manipulating others while focusing on
[1:28:40] what we can gain and profit stepping on
[1:28:44] others to get ahead you ever known
[1:28:47] anyone like that have you ever been
[1:28:49] anyone like that selfish is not
[1:28:52] selfishness is not just about how we act
[1:28:55] it's actually more than that it can also
[1:28:58] be what we don't do like leaving the
[1:29:03] mess oh I can tell you're ready for me
[1:29:06] to be on
[1:29:08] vacation like leaving the mess for
[1:29:10] someone else to clean
[1:29:14] up I I often say stepping over the piece
[1:29:17] of trash you know the older we get it
[1:29:21] gets a little harder to touch the floor
[1:29:24] so think about us would you you young
[1:29:26] whipper snappers think about us when you
[1:29:28] see something pick it up well I don't
[1:29:31] know what to do with it put it in your
[1:29:34] pocket throw it away later you know
[1:29:37] don't don't be that person that that
[1:29:40] sweeps their side of the porch and
[1:29:41] leaves the other neighbor's side
[1:29:44] unswept or or or cleans the snow off
[1:29:47] thank God we don't have to deal with a
[1:29:48] lot of that but I saw that picture where
[1:29:51] two apartments side by side and one set
[1:29:53] of steps and and and one three foot
[1:29:57] section is clear and the other three
[1:29:58] foot section just three
[1:30:00] feet it's not and and and it you be
[1:30:04] almost just as easy with a little
[1:30:07] sacrifice to do something for someone
[1:30:10] else don't let your love become so
[1:30:14] Frozen that you can't make a little
[1:30:17] sacrifice for somebody else so sometimes
[1:30:21] leaving the mess for someone else to
[1:30:23] clean up it's just an indication that
[1:30:25] something selfish is going on it also
[1:30:28] comes across in our words when we speak
[1:30:31] our
[1:30:32] mind it's that giving a piece of our
[1:30:35] mind
[1:30:36] away I gave him a piece of my mind I
[1:30:39] gave her a piece of my mind that's why
[1:30:41] some of us are running
[1:30:43] short because we've given so much of it
[1:30:46] away without considering the effect our
[1:30:49] words might have on others or could you
[1:30:54] read that for me my eyes are a little
[1:30:56] blurry or when
[1:31:01] we I know you're thinking about me but
[1:31:04] it's actually my job to talk a lot
[1:31:07] today it's the other talk it's that it's
[1:31:11] that running off at the
[1:31:13] mouth sometimes we expose our heart
[1:31:17] because we can't shut
[1:31:19] up oh wait wait just Amen brother
[1:31:25] you know we expose our heart by talking
[1:31:29] too much God help us this is not just
[1:31:32] about me making it all the way to the
[1:31:34] end I don't want to get there and be by
[1:31:37] myself I want us to go together how many
[1:31:41] of you want to journey together with
[1:31:43] God's people you you don't want to get
[1:31:46] ahead and leave others behind come go
[1:31:48] with us let God do a mighty work in your
[1:31:52] life today if there's any selfishness
[1:31:55] operating in you I know I know that he
[1:31:58] knows how if you'll just lay your heart
[1:32:01] on the operating table today he knows
[1:32:04] how to Grub it out he knows how to dig
[1:32:07] it out selfishness is an attitude issue
[1:32:12] for example you may let others have
[1:32:14] their way but inside you become
[1:32:17] resentful and bitter no it doesn't
[1:32:19] matter you go ahead there's only there's
[1:32:22] only one
[1:32:24] order
[1:32:26] left of
[1:32:27] fries and I'm going to let you have that
[1:32:31] order of fries but inside I'm going to
[1:32:35] resent
[1:32:36] it and uh I'm going to think about you
[1:32:39] every time I see you I'm going to think
[1:32:41] about the fact that you took the last
[1:32:43] order even though I offered it to you do
[1:32:46] you know there's a lot of people like
[1:32:47] that they'll say it doesn't matter I'm
[1:32:51] preaching they'll say it doesn't matter
[1:32:54] but it does matter don't lie if it
[1:33:00] matters you know um I have a precious
[1:33:04] daughter-in-law I have two amazing
[1:33:06] daughters and I have a precious
[1:33:09] daughter-in-law and a few weeks ago they
[1:33:11] wanted to have Burgers on Sunday look
[1:33:14] folks I know some of you have grown up
[1:33:16] eating hamburgers on Sunday but that
[1:33:18] doesn't appeal to me a hamburger is
[1:33:21] another day of the week food not a
[1:33:24] Sunday food uh I don't get a lot of
[1:33:27] Sunday food on Sunday anymore but Sunday
[1:33:30] is for fried chicken and uh mashed
[1:33:34] potatoes and and a boatload of
[1:33:37] gravy not
[1:33:39] Burgers somebody said well burgers are
[1:33:41] cheaper well I don't know where you're
[1:33:42] buying
[1:33:43] them but they're not as cheap as they
[1:33:46] once were I'm sorry I know Nathan I know
[1:33:49] some of you grew up on good burgers but
[1:33:51] I I just so I
[1:33:56] went I I went I wasn't happy but I went
[1:34:01] and we went to Five Guys well I'm I'm
[1:34:03] not a five guy fan I'll just be honest
[1:34:06] with you I'm not I've never been
[1:34:08] satisfied with my burger there but but
[1:34:11] that
[1:34:12] Sunday it was
[1:34:15] amazing do you know why I got my
[1:34:18] daughter-in-law's
[1:34:21] burger she knows how to order order
[1:34:25] them I just found out the burgers are
[1:34:28] amazing you just have to know what to
[1:34:30] put on them to make them
[1:34:32] amazing and I took one bite and I said
[1:34:36] uhoh this is not mine I think this is
[1:34:40] Jenna's and Jenna said you go right
[1:34:42] ahead and I I said well let me have at
[1:34:45] least one more
[1:34:48] B she said no no I'm serious you have it
[1:34:52] well I just took a risk that she would
[1:34:54] eventually be
[1:34:56] resentful and I ate it and it was
[1:34:59] amazing and from now on she's going to
[1:35:01] have to order my burger I know that's
[1:35:03] just a silly little
[1:35:06] thing but you'd be surprised in families
[1:35:09] how things like that
[1:35:11] can someone says can I have this last
[1:35:14] piece of chicken and everybody says oh
[1:35:15] yeah go ahead go ahead go ahead and then
[1:35:18] an argument happens
[1:35:20] later way later months later and
[1:35:23] somebody say you always get the best you
[1:35:26] always take the last you took that last
[1:35:29] piece of
[1:35:30] chicken yeah but you said it didn't
[1:35:32] matter how many of you know these things
[1:35:34] can oh I see some folks with me
[1:35:37] now I do I see some folks relating to my
[1:35:42] story it'll build up in you you don't
[1:35:45] want that let me tell you something when
[1:35:48] you learn to give it when you learn to
[1:35:51] let it go when you learn to let somebody
[1:35:54] else have
[1:35:55] it you get free there is a freedom that
[1:36:00] comes from not having to have
[1:36:04] it I had a first cousin who would pour
[1:36:08] us a glass of chocolate
[1:36:10] milk and then stand under the
[1:36:13] light to see which one was the fullest
[1:36:16] not to give it to
[1:36:19] me but to take it for
[1:36:21] himself I just let him have it in a
[1:36:25] childlike way I could have fussed I
[1:36:28] should have fussed but I just let him
[1:36:31] have it and and you know what looking
[1:36:34] back at his life that was probably the
[1:36:37] only pleasure that he
[1:36:39] had was taking the biggest glass of
[1:36:42] chocolate milk because his life has been
[1:36:45] a disaster since he was just a kid I
[1:36:48] learned it doesn't matter two sips less
[1:36:53] I know it's silly talk this morning but
[1:36:56] two sips less isn't going to starve
[1:36:59] you letting somebody else have the last
[1:37:02] piece is not going to starve you if
[1:37:04] you'll just make up your mind you're
[1:37:06] going to do it without bitterness you're
[1:37:08] going to do it without resentment I'm
[1:37:10] just not going to fight over something
[1:37:12] that doesn't matter well you're just
[1:37:14] talking to children aren't you I am
[1:37:16] overgrown
[1:37:19] ones cuz we were all toddlers once and
[1:37:23] some times we hold on to the silliest of
[1:37:25] things and you may think it's all just
[1:37:27] silliness but it can be
[1:37:31] rooted in something that plagued your
[1:37:36] parents and their
[1:37:40] parents and you don't want that
[1:37:43] selfishness is an attitude issue when
[1:37:46] you don't get what we want or when
[1:37:48] others get the credit
[1:37:55] some people get all the thank yous some
[1:37:58] people get all the
[1:38:00] appreciation some people get really
[1:38:03] bragged on while other people don't seem
[1:38:06] to get the kind of attention or the kind
[1:38:08] of recognition that they need and the
[1:38:11] quicker that you're able to let that
[1:38:15] go assuming hoping that it wasn't
[1:38:19] intentional when you start letting your
[1:38:21] mind tell you that it was on purpose
[1:38:24] purpose well I know him and I know her
[1:38:27] and I know how they operate when you
[1:38:29] start letting your mind tell you it was
[1:38:31] on purpose you're the one that's going
[1:38:33] to pay the price we want every bit of
[1:38:36] that root to be dealt with by the power
[1:38:38] of the Holy Spirit I don't want that in
[1:38:40] my life the English language has many
[1:38:44] words for
[1:38:45] selfishness bearing witness to how
[1:38:48] Universal human selfishness is a person
[1:38:51] might be arrogant self-serv serving
[1:38:54] self-absorbed self-centered boastful
[1:38:57] vain bigheaded self-possessed
[1:39:00] self-important self-focused conceited
[1:39:04] hauy proud preoccupied with self an
[1:39:08] egomaniac
[1:39:10] narcissistic
[1:39:12] self-indulgent ostentatious or
[1:39:15] presumptuous each of these words has a
[1:39:17] different Nuance but they all refer to
[1:39:20] someone who is always putting thems
[1:39:23] first and we read Isaiah 14 12-14 and we
[1:39:29] learned that this was something that was
[1:39:31] was formed in the heart of
[1:39:34] Lucifer he was more beautiful than all
[1:39:36] the other created beings he was so
[1:39:39] intricately and beautifully designed
[1:39:42] that the the very shape and form and
[1:39:46] anatomy of his body was created if you
[1:39:49] look at the word in the Hebrew it it's
[1:39:52] it teaches that somehow I don't know how
[1:39:55] this looked I don't know what it looked
[1:39:57] like but but the word tells us that
[1:39:59] somehow he had pipes in his
[1:40:04] body I don't know how that work well you
[1:40:06] got pipes in yours too you've got an
[1:40:10] esophagus you've got arteries and
[1:40:12] capillaries and veins and but evidently
[1:40:16] uh Lucifer this anointed cherub that
[1:40:23] before the throne even his body released
[1:40:27] musical sound that brought glory and
[1:40:31] honor to God and he got to looking at
[1:40:34] his own
[1:40:34] Beauty he saw his reflection in the
[1:40:38] throne and he started telling himself
[1:40:40] how beautiful he
[1:40:42] was how ugly everybody else was and the
[1:40:46] next thing you know he said I'm going to
[1:40:47] put my Throne up there above God's
[1:40:49] Throne come on that selfish ambition
[1:40:53] it's what led him to that great civil
[1:40:55] war that took place in the Realms of the
[1:40:58] spirit where he was able to persuade a
[1:41:00] great portion of the angels to follow
[1:41:03] him instead of the reality of their
[1:41:05] creator he's still doing that today he's
[1:41:08] still filling people with
[1:41:11] conceit he's making egomaniacs out of
[1:41:14] people he's plaguing even the body of
[1:41:17] Christ with narcissistic behavior where
[1:41:20] people think the whole church should
[1:41:22] revolve around them or the whole family
[1:41:25] should revolve around them even the
[1:41:28] whole
[1:41:29] world should revolve around them and all
[1:41:31] of it goes back to Satan's ambition and
[1:41:34] we don't want anything to do with that
[1:41:36] let the Saints say Amen James chapter
[1:41:41] 3 verse 14- 16 in the Amplified said but
[1:41:46] if you have bitter
[1:41:48] jealousy envy and
[1:41:51] contention rival rivalry rivalry let me
[1:41:55] look around and see uh who's
[1:41:58] here I I want to want to notice if there
[1:42:02] are people here who fall victim to
[1:42:08] rivalry always trying to outdo one
[1:42:12] another you know that is a painful path
[1:42:15] to choose it's an expensive path
[1:42:18] too always trying to have the best pair
[1:42:22] of tenis
[1:42:23] ues always trying to be the best better
[1:42:27] than someone else at oh let's just let's
[1:42:31] just pull something out of there
[1:42:34] volleyball disc
[1:42:39] golf always always trying to outdo
[1:42:42] always taking advantage to tell someone
[1:42:45] who's not as
[1:42:47] good how
[1:42:51] worthless how sorry
[1:42:54] what junk they
[1:42:58] are you're
[1:43:01] trash you're you're no
[1:43:03] good no wonder you don't like it you're
[1:43:07] lousy at
[1:43:09] it I I don't
[1:43:12] know but you've got to remember this
[1:43:15] everybody doesn't get that kind of
[1:43:21] humor we we don't all have the the same
[1:43:23] sense of humor I'm going to preach
[1:43:26] today all day in
[1:43:29] fact all
[1:43:31] day I told Olivia this and she said oh
[1:43:34] Dad
[1:43:35] please I said well look honey I'm not
[1:43:38] we're we don't have Sunday night we I'm
[1:43:39] not going to be here Tuesday night not
[1:43:41] going to be here Sunday not going to be
[1:43:42] here next Tuesday so let's see that's
[1:43:43] Tuesday is an hour and next Tuesday is
[1:43:46] an hour and two hours on Sunday that's
[1:43:48] four extra hours I should have tomorrow
[1:43:50] to get my point across she said oh Dad
[1:43:52] please
[1:43:56] love you
[1:43:59] honey I'm not going to do that but I
[1:44:02] want you to hear me
[1:44:04] well somebody said well I do that

[1:44:23] don't care people pick on him he thinks
[1:44:25] it's all funny he loves Trash Talk he
[1:44:27] doesn't care he knows I'm only kidding
[1:44:30] we need to remember that sometimes
[1:44:33] people tell us they don't care and they
[1:44:36] pretend like they don't care but when
[1:44:39] they're
[1:44:42] alone it's like turning on a recording
[1:44:45] they're able to replay the conversation
[1:44:47] and every
[1:44:49] insult hello every insult is replaced
[1:44:53] play in their mind and what they shook
[1:44:55] off and pretended not to let bother them
[1:44:58] earlier they go to bed with
[1:45:01] it they wake up the next morning with it
[1:45:05] and if they're under a particular kind
[1:45:07] of spirit they see it when they look at
[1:45:11] themselves it begins to change their
[1:45:15] confidence and you're just having a good
[1:45:17] time folks I want you to know in the
[1:45:20] family of God In The Fellowship of faith
[1:45:23] we should be careful what we say to one
[1:45:27] another somebody said but you know Fred
[1:45:30] and I have a relationship like that well
[1:45:32] you do until you
[1:45:34] don't it doesn't hurt until it does it
[1:45:38] doesn't matter until it does
[1:45:40] matter come on brother so I just advise
[1:45:45] you to you know clean out your
[1:45:48] mouth as Believers as Brothers and
[1:45:51] Sisters in Christ I I just encourage you
[1:45:54] to say positive things as much as
[1:45:56] possible about one another even if you
[1:45:59] have to be
[1:46:00] creative it's so good to be able to say
[1:46:03] an attaboy to somebody on occasion what
[1:46:08] Improvement what
[1:46:10] Improvement you know you're really
[1:46:12] giving it a good
[1:46:13] shot and uh older siblings teach younger
[1:46:17] siblings to talk like
[1:46:20] that and it looks innocent Until It's
[1:46:23] Not Innocent you do that in front of
[1:46:26] your children your children are going to
[1:46:27] smack talk and trash talk and they're
[1:46:30] going to do it before they're old enough
[1:46:32] and mature enough to handle the
[1:46:36] consequences and they're going to think
[1:46:38] they can talk to me like
[1:46:44] that now it's
[1:46:46] quiet and I'm not going to promise you
[1:46:49] that I'm going to kiss them and tell
[1:46:50] them it don't matter right cuz sometimes
[1:46:54] it
[1:46:54] does they're going to find an older
[1:46:57] person and and and they're not mature
[1:46:59] enough to understand what's
[1:47:01] appropriate and what's not appropriate
[1:47:04] and they're going to make a mess and you
[1:47:06] may never know it but there's a preacher
[1:47:09] somewhere a pastor somewhere who has to
[1:47:12] try to fix things and that's what I'm
[1:47:14] doing this morning in love I'm not
[1:47:17] referring to anyone in particular I'm
[1:47:19] referring to everyone in particular this
[1:47:22] is a part of a selfish ambition that has
[1:47:24] to die it's got to die today we don't
[1:47:27] want it we don't want our children to
[1:47:29] carry it amen but if you have bitter
[1:47:32] jealousy envy and contention rivalry
[1:47:35] selfish ambition in your hearts do not
[1:47:38] Pride yourselves on it and thus be in
[1:47:42] defiance of and false to the truth this
[1:47:46] superficial wisdom is not such as comes
[1:47:49] down from above but it is Earthly it's
[1:47:52] it's
[1:47:53] unspiritual it's Beast
[1:47:56] like it's more animall likee than it is
[1:47:59] Godlike even
[1:48:02] devilish it's like demons it's certainly
[1:48:05] not God demoniacal for wherever there is
[1:48:09] jealousy envy and contention rivalry and
[1:48:11] selfish ambition there will also be
[1:48:15] oh
[1:48:17] confusion confusion on showing
[1:48:21] respects conf confusion in so many ways
[1:48:24] unrest
[1:48:27] disharmony rebellion and all sorts of
[1:48:30] evil and vile practices you see if your
[1:48:33] children particularly hear you trash
[1:48:35] talking somebody then in another
[1:48:37] scenario when that person has to perhaps
[1:48:40] get onto your children in a public
[1:48:43] setting that that's that's on
[1:48:46] you because the lack of respect that the
[1:48:49] child showed to that person could be a
[1:48:52] produ
[1:48:54] of your disrespect to that
[1:48:57] person we want to teach respect and not
[1:49:00] disrespect I know that you really you
[1:49:03] know don't find this to be deep Doctrine
[1:49:05] this morning but I hope it's practical
[1:49:08] enough you can take some of it home with
[1:49:09] you when you leave for wherever there's
[1:49:12] jealousy and envy and contention and
[1:49:14] rival it it goes
[1:49:15] on 1 Corinthians 10:24 let no one then
[1:49:19] seek his own good and advantage Ag and
[1:49:23] profit but rather each one of the other
[1:49:26] let him
[1:49:28] seek the welfare of his neor his
[1:49:34] neighbor this is just how God wants his
[1:49:37] kids
[1:49:39] living are you with me in the message
[1:49:42] the anointed ones at the end time

[1:50:10] about the the possibility the ability to
[1:50:13] love one another even if you bitterly

[1:50:21] supposed to be able to embrace one
[1:50:23] another uh uh you know and and and turn
[1:50:26] and go and and and not compromise our
[1:50:30] faith but not treat someone bitterly
[1:50:33] because they don't agree with us brother

[1:51:30] of fire on their head and and brother
[1:51:34] Derek field said you know we always
[1:51:36] think that's like burning them up
[1:51:39] setting them on fire watching them burn
[1:51:42] but he said the real root of that is to
[1:51:44] is to melt them and and how many of you
[1:51:47] have ever had somebody turn around and
[1:51:49] do something very nice for you speak to
[1:51:51] you very kind when you were arrogant I
[1:51:55] know that in order to shake your head
[1:51:56] you'd have to admit that you were being
[1:51:58] arrogant but sometimes we are and
[1:52:01] controlling and someone turns around and
[1:52:03] they say something so sweet and your
[1:52:05] your face starts heating
[1:52:08] up because you know you didn't deserve
[1:52:11] that I love doing it it's fun it's
[1:52:13] actually very very fun try your best to
[1:52:16] practice it sometime when you've got one
[1:52:18] of those waitresses that woke up on the
[1:52:20] wrong side of the bed
[1:52:24] and she comes over and she what do you
[1:52:27] want engage her in such a a lovely way
[1:52:32] you know oh my this day couldn't get any
[1:52:35] worse for you could it h it's got to get
[1:52:37] better everything's going to be all
[1:52:39] right you must be under tremendous
[1:52:41] amount of pressure and and I'm going to
[1:52:43] give you a good tip I'm going to
[1:52:45] brighten up your
[1:52:46] day is it easy to do that no because we
[1:52:50] want good customer service
[1:52:53] but sometimes people are just in a mess
[1:52:57] and they don't need you to be
[1:53:00] crabby they need us to be kind they need
[1:53:04] us to offer them a a a the the the grace
[1:53:08] to make it a better day somebody said
[1:53:12] how does this apply to church it's it's
[1:53:14] the very nature and character of Jesus
[1:53:17] Christ to want to show love to somebody
[1:53:20] brother B said I don't want that
[1:53:21] arrogant selfish Spirit mixed up with
[1:53:23] mine I want my spirit to be pure and
[1:53:25] clean Brotherly Love
[1:53:29] holy I told you I didn't want lettuce on
[1:53:33] this why don't you just take it
[1:53:37] off so
[1:53:39] easy now if some holy with the Holy
[1:53:42] Spirit now if someone does anything
[1:53:44] wrong to me that's all
[1:53:46] right it's all right and though I might
[1:53:50] have the right to get back at them
[1:53:53] I don't want that in my life you know I
[1:53:56] I don't want to put words in brother
[1:53:58] bram's mouth but I hear him describing
[1:54:00] this as a burden it's a
[1:54:03] burden to need to get back at
[1:54:06] someone it's a burden you and I don't
[1:54:08] need to
[1:54:09] carry we just don't need to be weighted
[1:54:12] down with
[1:54:13] Revenge oh I want to have love he said I
[1:54:17] want to be ready to correct with love
[1:54:20] we're not talking about compr Rising
[1:54:23] truth with love that absolutely answers
[1:54:26] out
[1:54:28] yonder for it do you follow
[1:54:33] that and I have another
[1:54:36] one questions and answers number four a
[1:54:40] person ask a question question 389 when
[1:54:43] a person realizes he has an inferior
[1:54:45] complex or some sort of complex how may
[1:54:49] he overcome this so should he should it
[1:54:54] be if he was the only child caused this
[1:54:58] in his early youth now someone is trying
[1:55:01] to find a
[1:55:03] reason for the person behaving with this
[1:55:06] complex and it can be a lot of things it
[1:55:09] can be middle child syndrome they call
[1:55:12] it but just because you're a middle
[1:55:14] child doesn't mean you have to have a
[1:55:18] chip on your shoulder
[1:55:22] so don't buy into everything you read so
[1:55:26] the question is something happened maybe
[1:55:28] to cause this in his early youth brother
[1:55:31] brandham tells us how to handle it I
[1:55:33] want you to watch this
[1:55:35] take
[1:55:38] exactly the
[1:55:43] opposite we call that moving in the
[1:55:46] opposite
[1:55:50] Spirit if someone treat you
[1:55:54] wrong don't treat them wrong back treat
[1:55:57] them
[1:55:59] right if you find yourself being
[1:56:03] stingy no one wants to hear this there's
[1:56:06] only one way to get rid of
[1:56:09] stinginess you have to give yourself
[1:56:12] out the only way to get out of that mess
[1:56:15] is give yourself out just give till it
[1:56:18] hurts and do it every time you feel
[1:56:21] something
[1:56:24] stingy yes you're moving in the opposite
[1:56:28] Spirit when you feel like you you
[1:56:31] deserve to be angry choose to be at
[1:56:35] rest when you feel like the person who
[1:56:38] mistreats you is
[1:56:40] celebrated and no one
[1:56:43] notices how mistreated you
[1:56:46] are when you feel yourself like that
[1:56:49] find
[1:56:50] somebody on popular or standing in the
[1:56:55] edges of
[1:56:57] life in the back of the crowd and pour
[1:57:00] love on them accept them show them that
[1:57:05] you prefer their company and you want to
[1:57:08] bless them and you want to be a part of
[1:57:10] their lives instead of lamenting over
[1:57:12] the fact that somebody doesn't want you
[1:57:15] in their life if you stay in that place
[1:57:17] it will bitter you it won't better you
[1:57:21] it'll make bitter and you'll run your
[1:57:25] mouth you'll run your
[1:57:28] mouth well they don't treat my kids like
[1:57:30] they treat everybody else's kids then
[1:57:33] you make it a point not to let that
[1:57:36] thing eat at
[1:57:40] you do something nice for somebody
[1:57:43] else's
[1:57:44] [Music]
[1:57:46] children don't let the enemy overwhelm
[1:57:50] you with any bit ESS or resentment not
[1:57:53] in this hour just say Lord I'm giving
[1:57:56] you my
[1:57:57] children I want you to love them and
[1:58:00] deal with them and draw them to you I'm
[1:58:02] tired of blaming other people for the
[1:58:05] children I
[1:58:12] raised oh
[1:58:14] my it's getting tied in here move in the
[1:58:19] opposite Spirit take exactly the
[1:58:21] opposite he said if you're always
[1:58:23] wanting your way and that one little
[1:58:27] brat that wants to always have
[1:58:30] everything your way turn right back
[1:58:32] around and give everything you got the
[1:58:35] other way don't let that thing get a
[1:58:39] hold of you if you're selfish and you
[1:58:41] want to hold everything then start
[1:58:43] giving away what you got now you'll say
[1:58:46] Amen you wouldn't amen me while ago but
[1:58:49] now the prophet said it so you can
[1:58:50] really let out a big old hearty amen you
[1:58:54] give yourself out of that stingy place
[1:58:57] just go the vice versa he says that's
[1:59:00] the way to overcome anything it's an
[1:59:03] antidote when you feel angry choose
[1:59:07] Joy when you when you feel
[1:59:10] jealous choose not to feel
[1:59:13] jealous what's the opposite of jealousy
[1:59:16] wanting everybody to be blessed and
[1:59:18] prosper
[1:59:22] well praise the
[1:59:25] Lord that's the antidote he said you
[1:59:28] know my old southern mother used to say
[1:59:31] hair off the dog back is good for the
[1:59:36] bite I have to confess to you folks I
[1:59:39] have no idea what that
[1:59:42] means but I think it means something
[1:59:44] like moving the opposite
[1:59:48] Spirit maybe it's something like what's
[1:59:51] good for the Goosey is good for the
[1:59:52] gander I don't know really but I love
[1:59:55] the fact that brother brandham thought
[1:59:57] that everyone was going to understand
[1:59:59] that
[2:00:00] expression I don't know for sure that I
[2:00:02] get it but anyway it's the truth I'm
[2:00:04] going to just amen it cuz I got a
[2:00:07] feeling he knew what it meant and it
[2:00:08] went right along with the sermon okay in
[2:00:11] a message called I have heard but now I
[2:00:13] see treport he said it won't work no
[2:00:18] selfish thing will work your motives and
[2:00:21] object Ives has to be exactly perfectly
[2:00:24] right then you have faith to ask if our
[2:00:27] hearts condemn us not then we have
[2:00:31] confidence we've got to have confidence
[2:00:34] I want this to be to the honor and glory
[2:00:38] of God this is like brother brandom's
[2:00:40] expression getting the dead cats off the
[2:00:42] line you don't have to do a bunch of
[2:00:45] repenting when you need to call on the
[2:00:46] Lord you want your heart to be right he
[2:00:49] said then faith has a channel to move
[2:00:51] into if it doesn't then you've got
[2:00:53] mental intellectual faith and not
[2:00:55] genuine Faith from God he said that
[2:00:58] intellectual faith will get you nowhere
[2:01:02] might get you emotional but it won't get
[2:01:04] you the healing that's right how many of
[2:01:07] you are looking for healing from your
[2:01:11] past you're you you don't want to blame
[2:01:13] your childhood you want to be healed
[2:01:16] from it you don't want to be handicapped
[2:01:19] from where you've been you want to be
[2:01:21] heal healed from it so that you can keep
[2:01:24] moving
[2:01:25] forward might get you
[2:01:28] emotional but it won't get you healed
[2:01:32] are you good for a few more minutes good
[2:01:36] that's that's it's
[2:01:39] 1257 um I want you to look at Proverbs
[2:01:42] with me just a
[2:01:43] moment I can't spend a lot of time here
[2:01:47] but I want to spend a few minutes here
[2:01:48] Proverbs 14:30 a sound heart
[2:01:53] heart is the life of the
[2:01:56] flesh but
[2:02:01] Envy the
[2:02:04] rottenness of the
[2:02:06] bones I don't know about you but I don't
[2:02:09] want any rotten in rot in my bones it
[2:02:12] doesn't sound
[2:02:14] Pleasant you don't want anything rotten
[2:02:17] as your core you want something
[2:02:20] beautiful something
[2:02:23] holy I spent a lot of time on this verse
[2:02:27] I told you this last Sunday I think or
[2:02:29] last maybe Sunday was a week ago Tuesday
[2:02:31] night or whenever it was last time I
[2:02:33] ministered I spent eight hours breaking
[2:02:36] down biblically the difference between
[2:02:40] envy and
[2:02:41] jealousy and and I'm not going to go
[2:02:44] very far into the study not now we may
[2:02:47] at another time but I want to hit just a
[2:02:50] few of the highlights
[2:02:52] because we often use those words
[2:02:56] synonymously as though they mean the
[2:02:58] same thing and they're very very similar
[2:03:01] you awake Jesse good they're cousins to
[2:03:05] each other but there is biblically
[2:03:08] enough difference in those words that it
[2:03:11] might help you to understand which one
[2:03:14] is trying to take a hold of
[2:03:16] you if you look at Proverbs 14:30 that
[2:03:20] we just read the word sound there I find
[2:03:23] it to be a King James
[2:03:25] word that may or may not be easily
[2:03:29] understood so let's look at what that
[2:03:32] word means in the Hebrew the word sound
[2:03:35] in the Hebrew comes from from a a word
[2:03:39] that is mar
[2:03:40] marpe which is a healing cure Health but
[2:03:45] it boils down to calmness and
[2:03:48] gentleness how many of you'd like to
[2:03:50] live a calmer life
[2:03:53] anybody would anybody like to be more
[2:03:57] gentle yes I think a lot of us would so
[2:04:01] to have a sound heart is to have a calm
[2:04:06] heart it's to have a gentle heart or A
[2:04:09] Gentle Spirit now biblically most of the
[2:04:13] time when the word in English is heart
[2:04:16] it's not referring to the blood
[2:04:18] pump most of the time in English when it
[2:04:21] says the word heart it's actually
[2:04:23] referring to the
[2:04:25] mind which is the seed of the
[2:04:28] emotions biblically the heart is the
[2:04:31] seat or the seedbed of the emotions but
[2:04:35] that's the mind not the pump the mind so
[2:04:40] to have a calm sound let me say it this
[2:04:43] way to have a sound heart is to have a
[2:04:47] Calm
[2:04:48] Mind wouldn't you like to have such a
[2:04:51] settledness in your mind in your heart
[2:04:56] that you were not easily flustrated
[2:05:00] that's a good word not easily flustrated
[2:05:03] when you come into an environment that
[2:05:06] is
[2:05:07] chaotic wouldn't it be wonderful to have
[2:05:10] so much calmness in your mind so much
[2:05:13] gentleness in your heart that no matter
[2:05:16] what was going on around you you were
[2:05:18] able just to navigate it quietly and
[2:05:22] confidently not losing your peace not
[2:05:25] losing your temper not losing your joy
[2:05:29] not getting red in the
[2:05:31] face not sending your blood pressure
[2:05:34] through the roof but just calmly oh come
[2:05:37] on
[2:05:40] husbands I'm preaching to
[2:05:43] us wives
[2:05:45] too just so calm and gentle in your
[2:05:49] heart one of the ways to make sure that
[2:05:51] your heart is well your mind is well is
[2:05:55] to is to deal with those issues that
[2:05:59] bring us out of peace and into chaos
[2:06:05] and the writer here says
[2:06:09] Envy in in Hebrew it's Cana and it means
[2:06:15] ardor or Zeal or anger rivalry and it
[2:06:21] can mean in some verses of scripture
[2:06:25] jealousy but there is a
[2:06:28] difference if you look at that in the
[2:06:33] Amplified you find a better use of those
[2:06:38] Hebrew words let's glance at it a calm
[2:06:43] and
[2:06:43] undisturbed mind and heart are the life
[2:06:49] and health of the body
[2:06:52] body I mean that's
[2:06:55] spiritual and it's also not somebody
[2:06:58] said what do you mean well science now
[2:07:00] tells us that as our mind
[2:07:05] goes our body
[2:07:07] goes the Bible already tried to tell us
[2:07:10] that out of the abundance of the heart
[2:07:13] the mouth talks and whatever we
[2:07:17] say is what we become that's what the
[2:07:20] Bible tells tells us and and we know
[2:07:23] that's not just spiritually it's also
[2:07:26] physically if our mind is consumed with
[2:07:29] worry and Chaos it affects the systems
[2:07:32] of our
[2:07:33] body our nervous system can cause our
[2:07:37] organs to to
[2:07:40] deteriorate a nervous mind can cause a a
[2:07:44] breakdown in the organs of our
[2:07:47] body and a chaotic mind and a chaotic
[2:07:52] heart can actually destroy brain
[2:07:55] cells and if you're like me you want to
[2:07:57] hold on to everyone you got you don't
[2:08:00] want to lose any and stress and worry
[2:08:04] and anxiety and resentment and rivalry
[2:08:09] and H all of this pressure that we get
[2:08:13] under it causes us to lose what we need
[2:08:18] to have a sound mind
[2:08:22] into our Elder
[2:08:24] years I know that doctors will tell you
[2:08:27] that it's absolutely normal to lose a
[2:08:30] portion of cognitive skill as you age
[2:08:33] and I agree but I also want you to know
[2:08:37] that you don't have to accept that as
[2:08:39] your
[2:08:40] destiny you can believe what Bible what
[2:08:43] the scripture says I will keep him in
[2:08:47] perfect peace whose mind whose heart is
[2:08:54] stayed is fixed on me God said one of
[2:08:59] the benefits of keeping your mind on me
[2:09:02] is I'll help you to have
[2:09:03] calmness I'll help you to have
[2:09:06] wholeness I'll I'll help you to to live
[2:09:09] in a place of of Peace instead of worry
[2:09:15] and
[2:09:16] anxiety folks we need
[2:09:18] that every one of us need that the calm
[2:09:21] and undisturbed mind and heart are the
[2:09:24] life and the health of the body but Envy
[2:09:27] jealousy and wrath are like rottenness
[2:09:31] of the
[2:09:32] bones the reason why the writer chose
[2:09:35] the bones is because the bones are the
[2:09:39] foundation of the whole body and if you
[2:09:42] have something like osteoporosis and
[2:09:44] your bones start being brittle and you
[2:09:47] start losing your bone mass
[2:09:51] then the rest of the body starts sort of
[2:09:54] caving because it's the foundation that
[2:09:57] holds everything together and so the
[2:10:00] writer is saying if you keep your mind
[2:10:03] and your heart calm and undisturbed and
[2:10:06] you don't let envy and jealousy Rule and
[2:10:10] reign in your life your foundation will
[2:10:14] remain strong and rottenness will not
[2:10:17] start working on the root of Who You Are
[2:10:22] does anybody sound think that sounds
[2:10:24] pretty good I don't want any rottenness
[2:10:27] working in me amen although many people
[2:10:31] consider envy and jealousy synonymous
[2:10:34] they actually have distinct meanings and
[2:10:37] I want to show you just a a very brief
[2:10:41] difference in the two words because if
[2:10:44] any of this has room in your life I want
[2:10:47] you to let the Holy Spirit get it out
[2:10:50] today
[2:10:51] not Tuesday not next Sunday I want you
[2:10:55] to let the Holy Spirit I want to let the
[2:10:57] Holy Spirit get this out of me today
[2:11:00] right now I want this thing to come to
[2:11:03] an end amen so let's look at Envy
[2:11:07] first
[2:11:08] Envy is the longing or painful
[2:11:13] feeling to have what someone else
[2:11:18] has whether it be attributes
[2:11:23] or
[2:11:26] possessions now Envy is never a positive
[2:11:31] word jealousy is a word that biblically
[2:11:35] has a redeemable meaning right because
[2:11:38] you can be jealous for the things of God
[2:11:42] passionate because the root word that's
[2:11:45] used to translate uh jealousy is
[2:11:49] actually the word that says
[2:11:52] Zeal so you can be zealous for God
[2:11:56] jealous for the things of God but Envy
[2:12:00] is not a redeemable word So when you say
[2:12:04] I envy her long hair that's not
[2:12:07] redeemable you may not mean any harm by
[2:12:10] it you may be trying to compliment her
[2:12:14] and here's how you do that let me show
[2:12:16] you how you do that you say oh my your
[2:12:18] hair is so beautiful I just wanted to
[2:12:20] tell you your hair is so beautiful you
[2:12:24] don't say I envy your hair because Envy
[2:12:29] is never a word that means something
[2:12:33] positive it's always negative so when
[2:12:36] you say Envy I envy your hair you're
[2:12:40] saying I really wished I had it and you
[2:12:45] don't you
[2:12:47] didn't somebody said well when I say
[2:12:50] that I always say I wouldn't want to
[2:12:52] take yours but I would like to have some
[2:12:55] just like it why don't you just say I
[2:12:59] really like your
[2:13:02] hair your hair is
[2:13:05] beautiful then you keep your heart out
[2:13:08] of it you're guarding your heart by not
[2:13:12] wishing you had it when it belongs to
[2:13:16] someone else is anybody with me Jesse
[2:13:19] are you with me
[2:13:23] he's very alert Steven's helping him
[2:13:26] probably but he's very
[2:13:28] alert
[2:13:30] Envy is the distress or resentment we
[2:13:34] feel when others
[2:13:39] have I'm going to need some
[2:13:42] water what we have
[2:13:48] not I got a hole in my shoe
[2:13:53] and someone else has a new pair every
[2:13:58] week you don't want that in your
[2:14:01] heart so here's what you
[2:14:04] say I really like those
[2:14:07] shoes if you do don't
[2:14:10] lie don't say anything some people will
[2:14:13] never pay compliment to anybody else but
[2:14:17] go home and tell their husband no one
[2:14:19] said a word about my new Drive finally
[2:14:21] get a new dress and nobody says anything
[2:14:23] about it well are you a person who
[2:14:26] compliments other people oh I'm
[2:14:27] preaching
[2:14:29] now are you someone who compliments
[2:14:32] other
[2:14:33] people some people think the only form
[2:14:36] of complimenting is to
[2:14:39] emulate and say they go out and copy
[2:14:41] instead of telling you I love your dress
[2:14:43] they just go buy one like
[2:14:49] it now I want you to know when you're
[2:14:51] modest there's only so many dresses
[2:14:54] available and it's bound to
[2:14:57] happen that someone's going to have the
[2:14:59] same
[2:15:03] outfit but I wouldn't do it on
[2:15:06] purpose if I were you I wouldn't I I
[2:15:09] wouldn't want to especially if I hadn't
[2:15:12] have said to my friend you you look
[2:15:14] beautiful in
[2:15:17] that I've even heard people be so
[2:15:20] complimentary to say you you look
[2:15:22] beautiful in that dress and and and I
[2:15:24] have a wedding in in Ohio and and would
[2:15:27] you mind very much if I bought a dress
[2:15:29] just like that and War to the wedding in
[2:15:30] Ohio and and you're supposed to say why
[2:15:34] that would be wonderful I I I think I
[2:15:37] think that'd be a great
[2:15:39] idea and then when you get in the car
[2:15:41] you're supposed to say that again to
[2:15:43] your family and not something else can
[2:15:46] you believe the nerve of that woman
[2:15:51] oh this is just silly preaching this
[2:15:53] morning
[2:15:56] mm you see the Holy Ghost goes home with
[2:16:01] you he knows how you tell somebody it
[2:16:04] don't matter in five minutes
[2:16:08] later it matters you don't want that in
[2:16:12] your
[2:16:13] heart you you know it wouldn't hurt any
[2:16:15] of us to be more complimentary toward
[2:16:17] one
[2:16:18] another and mean it flatter is
[2:16:22] sin to to say something uh flattering
[2:16:25] about someone uh pay someone a
[2:16:27] compliment that you don't mean that's
[2:16:29] flattery just shut
[2:16:32] up but if you mean it if you can
[2:16:34] sincerely say it it's a blessing to hear
[2:16:38] let me tell you something there there
[2:16:41] there are most people in this room can
[2:16:43] say that there has been a time in your
[2:16:46] life that it really meant something to
[2:16:48] you when someone said
[2:16:52] you've you've you've lost some weight
[2:16:54] you got to be careful with that
[2:16:58] one you got to be very delicate with
[2:17:00] that
[2:17:01] one but but it's just a nice thing
[2:17:05] sometime when you have starved
[2:17:09] yourself and someone says my you've lost
[2:17:11] a little weight haven't
[2:17:15] you instead of instead of across the
[2:17:18] room going
[2:17:26] you know the only people that resent
[2:17:28] when someone else is losing
[2:17:34] weight it's when they're
[2:17:40] not ain't that the
[2:17:42] truth we should compliment one another
[2:17:46] and mean it from our heart it's what
[2:17:49] brothers and sisters Sisters in Christ
[2:17:52] do you you families ought to practice
[2:17:56] it it it's just it's just right it's
[2:18:00] just right and it helps keep Envy out of
[2:18:04] your life when you celebrate other
[2:18:07] people's
[2:18:08] victories it helps keep Envy out of your
[2:18:12] life oh brother would you show me your
[2:18:15] new vehicle I'd like to have a look at
[2:18:17] it I'm so God bless I'm so glad God
[2:18:21] blessed you with that you needed a safe
[2:18:24] vehicle for your
[2:18:27] family that's I'm just helping you learn
[2:18:29] I'm just giving you some crib notes just
[2:18:32] write them down and read them off the
[2:18:33] card when you don't know what to say to
[2:18:35] somebody instead of letting the enemy
[2:18:39] won't he do it you you're looking at me
[2:18:42] like I'm the only sinner in the
[2:18:45] room but we struggle like this sometime
[2:18:49] and and it's not it's not the will of
[2:18:51] God Envy is the distress or resentment
[2:18:54] we feel when others have what we have
[2:18:58] not envy
[2:19:00] is Envy feels like
[2:19:03] oh I want
[2:19:10] that you can have it if you learn to
[2:19:15] celebrate somebody
[2:19:18] else it's a key
[2:19:21] yes
[2:19:22] James tells us we read it earlier but if
[2:19:27] you have bitter envying and strife in
[2:19:29] your hearts Glory not and lie not
[2:19:31] against the truth this wisdom descendeth
[2:19:35] not from above but is Earthly sensual
[2:19:38] devilish for where envy and strife is
[2:19:40] there is confusion in every evil work
[2:19:44] that word that is translated envying
[2:19:46] there is actually the word that's used
[2:19:48] for jealous so in some of the places the
[2:19:51] word is translated
[2:19:54] synonymously but there is a difference
[2:19:56] and here it is
[2:19:58] jealousy if you're jealous if you're
[2:20:01] envious you want what somebody else has
[2:20:04] if you're jealous you feel
[2:20:07] threatened
[2:20:08] protective or fearful of losing one's
[2:20:14] position or
[2:20:16] situation to someone
[2:20:19] else in en is wanting what somebody else
[2:20:23] has jealousy is feeling overly
[2:20:27] protective of what you have because you
[2:20:30] perceive that someone else wants to get
[2:20:34] it do you see how these things can work
[2:20:36] pretty close
[2:20:38] together how many of you see the
[2:20:41] difference I don't want to move forward
[2:20:43] until you can Envy is wanting what
[2:20:46] somebody else has jealousy is when you
[2:20:49] feel threatened
[2:20:52] somebody wants your wife
[2:20:55] brother that'll make anybody jealous
[2:20:59] well not anybody because some people
[2:21:01] might actually be wanting to give their
[2:21:02] wife
[2:21:04] away but that would make most people
[2:21:06] feel quite
[2:21:10] threatened to feel jealous means to feel
[2:21:14] threatened
[2:21:19] insecure or protective of something you
[2:21:22] already
[2:21:26] have especially in a romantic
[2:21:34] sense you you you've got to come to a
[2:21:36] place in in a relationship where you
[2:21:40] understand that as a as a young lady
[2:21:43] that every every young lady out there is
[2:21:45] not your
[2:21:48] competition there's at least one person
[2:21:52] for
[2:21:53] everybody it
[2:21:57] seems and you're going to have to
[2:21:59] understand that people can have
[2:22:02] friends and sometimes they're of the
[2:22:05] same gender and of course there's lots
[2:22:07] of protective measures that have to be
[2:22:10] put in place so that so that there is
[2:22:13] nothing to worry
[2:22:16] about if you're going to have a
[2:22:17] friendship with someone of the opposite
[2:22:20] uh gender you're going to have to be
[2:22:22] very careful especially as a married
[2:22:24] person or as a spoken for person you
[2:22:27] you'll have to put some some boundaries
[2:22:29] in place but it's possible and it's
[2:22:35] doable and if you only want him sometime
[2:22:38] why do you let it bother you that
[2:22:40] somebody else wants
[2:22:46] him am I doing okay
[2:22:51] let's go
[2:22:53] on wouldn't you hate for this to be your
[2:22:55] first Sunday in
[2:22:59] Alabama jealousy feels like back
[2:23:02] off I just wanted you to know what
[2:23:04] jealousy feels like back
[2:23:07] off this one's
[2:23:08] [Music]
[2:23:10] mine that's okay if she
[2:23:13] is that's okay if he is but don't you
[2:23:17] assume anything
[2:23:22] hello jealousy is also very closely tied
[2:23:25] to a feeling here's the root don't throw
[2:23:29] anything at
[2:23:30] me this is the root it's closely tied to
[2:23:33] a feeling of
[2:23:35] being less
[2:23:37] than we don't feel
[2:23:39] threatened if we feel
[2:23:42] confident but when we don't feel
[2:23:44] confident in our relationship or in
[2:23:46] ourself then we feel threatened by who
[2:23:50] whoever
[2:23:51] trolls whoever
[2:23:53] Trends whoever moves around the Bible is
[2:23:57] so clear and I'll show you this sometime
[2:23:59] the Bible is so clear you'd be surprised
[2:24:02] how many times the word jealousy appears
[2:24:04] how many times the word envy appears and
[2:24:06] it almost always appears in the context
[2:24:09] of Christian Life is't that
[2:24:13] crazy the Bible has little to say about
[2:24:16] Sinners being envious
[2:24:20] or or ungodly men being
[2:24:23] jealous the Bible mainly talks about
[2:24:26] Believers Christians spirit filled
[2:24:30] folk dealing with
[2:24:33] Envy I want what you
[2:24:39] got I recently heard a pastor introduce
[2:24:42] an
[2:24:45] evangelist a speaker in his
[2:24:49] church and he did it so
[2:24:53] factiously that I sensed there was
[2:24:55] something deeper going
[2:25:02] on he sings better than I do he preaches
[2:25:06] better than I do come on preach for us
[2:25:11] it was just kind of the
[2:25:13] attitude we've all probably said I've
[2:25:16] said before you know this this brother's
[2:25:19] the whole package he preaches and sings
[2:25:21] Come
[2:25:23] on but to but
[2:25:26] to come
[2:25:28] across
[2:25:30] sarcastic
[2:25:32] factious it's usually because there is
[2:25:35] something
[2:25:36] there why didn't he just say let me
[2:25:39] introduce you to a newer model than
[2:25:44] I because that's really what he's going
[2:25:47] through he thought that it would be a
[2:25:50] appropriate to sort of
[2:25:53] belittle to remind
[2:25:57] everybody how important he
[2:26:00] is you know the one thing I hear about
[2:26:03] brother brandom never having the
[2:26:04] opportunity to meet
[2:26:07] him I remember calling Brother Cleveland
[2:26:10] up on the phone one night late and I
[2:26:12] said Brother Cleveland promise me one
[2:26:15] thing what is that brother Shelly I want
[2:26:17] you to take me
[2:26:20] to a service where brother brandham
[2:26:23] is I don't have to have a
[2:26:26] conversation I just want to be in the
[2:26:28] room with him and I sure would love to
[2:26:31] shake his
[2:26:33] hand and he said brother Shelly I'm so
[2:26:35] sorry to tell you but brother brandham
[2:26:38] died in
[2:26:40] 1965 three years before I was born I had
[2:26:44] no idea I'd never heard the name until I
[2:26:48] heard the
[2:26:49] sermon I I remember that
[2:26:52] feeling I I remember what that felt
[2:26:55] like how disappointed I
[2:26:59] was sometimes people will take a sense
[2:27:02] of of of
[2:27:05] uh being
[2:27:07] funny and they mean something
[2:27:10] more and you sense that they
[2:27:13] do and they're covering up for their own
[2:27:16] hurt or their own
[2:27:18] woundedness and that's a great
[2:27:20] opportunity for you and I to cover that
[2:27:23] situation with a lot of Grace and with a
[2:27:26] lot of
[2:27:28] love are you with me I'm going to back
[2:27:31] off of I was going in a direction I'm
[2:27:33] going to pull back so that we can
[2:27:36] close jealousy is a sense of dread or
[2:27:41] suspicion we feel when what we have what
[2:27:45] we have might be taken
[2:27:47] away there's such a thing as God L
[2:27:50] jealousy but the Bible never speaks of
[2:27:53] Envy in a good
[2:27:57] light if you recognize that someone is
[2:28:00] envious or jealous of you it's not a
[2:28:03] good
[2:28:05] feeling if that feels good to you
[2:28:08] there's probably something else going on
[2:28:09] in your life that needs a
[2:28:14] checkup no one wants to live their life
[2:28:16] tiptoeing around fragile envious
[2:28:21] jealous
[2:28:23] people why don't we teach our children
[2:28:26] that for instance every family just
[2:28:29] doesn't have the same thing in
[2:28:32] life it just doesn't happen that way but
[2:28:35] it's not good to be envious or jealous
[2:28:38] it's good to be thankful to be grateful
[2:28:41] to be blessed by what God has given us
[2:28:44] and I Clos the last message I preached
[2:28:47] with this statement that a lot of people
[2:28:49] have have struggled with but the reality
[2:28:53] is that many times God will give you
[2:28:55] what he
[2:28:57] can trust you with so if we work on our
[2:29:03] character then God can often trust us
[2:29:07] with
[2:29:08] more for instance in the Bible we have
[2:29:15] aen aen must have thought a lot of
[2:29:18] himself
[2:29:21] because he thought the rules didn't
[2:29:24] apply to
[2:29:26] him aen yielded to selfishness and
[2:29:29] concern only for me and
[2:29:35] mine as long as as I get the nice trip
[2:29:39] as long as
[2:29:41] I have the Babylonian wedge of silver in
[2:29:46] my tent for rainy
[2:29:48] days as long as as I get the
[2:29:53] filet it doesn't matter how I get
[2:29:57] it as long as I can keep up
[2:30:03] hirs I want you to know that is a devil
[2:30:08] that has to be dealt
[2:30:10] with achen was concerned about me and
[2:30:13] mine with no concern for others with
[2:30:15] similar needs and opportunities
[2:30:20] didn't think about other
[2:30:22] families I'll take it all when no one's
[2:30:25] looking achen was
[2:30:28] self-promoting and here's the thing
[2:30:30] about someone who promotes themselves
[2:30:33] they never do it by just building up who
[2:30:36] they are the only way they can build up
[2:30:38] who they are is to pull everybody else
[2:30:45] down aen was self-promoting and
[2:30:47] possessive without regard for Direct
[2:30:49] ctions given by the leadership he was a
[2:30:52] loner with little accountability he paid
[2:30:57] dearly for his
[2:31:00] selfishness and here's the key when God
[2:31:03] helps you out of selfishness and he will
[2:31:07] he will he will he can and he will don't
[2:31:11] ever cover it
[2:31:15] up don't ever try to make it less than
[2:31:18] it was
[2:31:20] because in order to do that you'll have
[2:31:21] to
[2:31:22] lie and the truth is supposed to come
[2:31:25] out of our mouths as Believers remember
[2:31:29] sometime when we're bragging about what
[2:31:31] we have had or what we have known
[2:31:35] remember that sometimes it was at other
[2:31:37] people's
[2:31:38] expense and we should be a little
[2:31:41] careful how we build it
[2:31:45] up without telling the whole
[2:31:48] story because somebody knows the whole
[2:31:52] story somebody knows the whole story the
[2:31:56] whole picture don't get under the burden
[2:31:59] of selfish
[2:32:02] ambition let God do the work let him
[2:32:06] exalt let him lift up in the modern
[2:32:09] Church everybody has to have a
[2:32:12] title they put it on their business
[2:32:15] card Apostle so and so Prophet so and so
[2:32:20] uh intercessor so and so you you you
[2:32:24] don't have to have a
[2:32:25] title just yield to
[2:32:28] God let God have his way in your life
[2:32:32] and if you're to be promoted guess
[2:32:35] what he knows how to promote
[2:32:40] us I want to I want to get ready to have
[2:32:43] the musicians to
[2:32:45] come before I do I want to read a a
[2:32:49] couple three four paragraphs from the
[2:32:51] future
[2:32:52] home in paragraph 88 brother bam said
[2:32:56] you can't repent for what Adam
[2:32:59] done you never done it Adam did you just
[2:33:05] get
[2:33:07] forgiveness for what you done you follow
[2:33:11] that may not be perfect English but you
[2:33:13] got it didn't
[2:33:17] you the old nature
[2:33:21] is still
[2:33:22] there when somebody has to constantly
[2:33:25] tell you how much money they
[2:33:29] make the old
[2:33:32] nature must still be
[2:33:37] there it must make them feel
[2:33:41] good to flaunt to
[2:33:44] brag don't let that be who you
[2:33:48] are brother vam said let me take this
[2:33:51] board just a minute and he draws an
[2:33:52] illustration on the Blackboard here is a
[2:33:55] human
[2:33:56] heart he said now I'm a long ways from
[2:33:59] being an artist here's the human heart
[2:34:00] and here's the human heart he puts two
[2:34:02] there now this one over here has a snake
[2:34:04] in it he said that's
[2:34:06] sin here he has his life this one over
[2:34:11] here has a dove in it which is the holy
[2:34:13] spirit here he has a
[2:34:15] life well this one here the one with the
[2:34:18] snake he has malice
[2:34:20] hatred Envy that's what's causing it
[2:34:25] this fellow here what's he talking about
[2:34:28] the snake the old nature the sinful
[2:34:32] nature well this one over here has love
[2:34:34] joy
[2:34:36] longsuffering that's what does it down
[2:34:39] here the dove the presence of the Holy
[2:34:42] Spirit how many of you know we need more
[2:34:45] oh yes oh yes we need more the Holy
[2:34:50] Spirit we need more of the Holy Ghost in
[2:34:53] our life can I hear you say Amen
[2:34:56] Jesse can I hear your amen
[2:34:59] Jesse good had to call him
[2:35:03] twice now when you are asked or you're
[2:35:06] forgiven of your sins you've only done
[2:35:08] this taken that away and he
[2:35:11] erases but the thing that oh excuse me
[2:35:15] he didn't eras yet but the thing that
[2:35:16] made you do it is still there
[2:35:20] let me start over now when you are asked
[2:35:23] or you are forgiven of your sin you've
[2:35:25] only done this taken that away the
[2:35:28] attributes but the thing that made you
[2:35:31] do it is still there that's the old root
[2:35:33] of
[2:35:34] evil it's still there notice then you
[2:35:37] repent and are baptized in the name of
[2:35:40] Jesus Christ that he forgave you of your
[2:35:43] sins notice then secondly
[2:35:46] comes sanctification which sets our mind
[2:35:49] find an order woo for Holiness I like
[2:35:54] the way that's expressed to think
[2:35:57] right I want to think right Lord
[2:36:01] sanctification is a p compound Greek
[2:36:04] word which means cleaned and set aside
[2:36:08] for
[2:36:10] service I like it he said then the next
[2:36:13] comes the baptism of the fire and holy
[2:36:17] ghost that God might dwell dwell in us
[2:36:20] and the fire of God cleanses our hearts
[2:36:23] from
[2:36:25] sin it erases the
[2:36:28] serpent it puts the Holy Ghost Inside
[2:36:32] the gentle Dove then we bring forth the
[2:36:37] same life that this
[2:36:40] did the dove because that's in us how
[2:36:47] many of you understood the simple
[2:36:50] uh way that brother brandom explained
[2:36:52] that in this message you may you may get
[2:36:55] rid of some things but it's the nature
[2:36:57] it's the root of that thing you've got
[2:36:59] to go right down to the root of it and
[2:37:01] you've got to choose to keep moving in
[2:37:04] the opposite spirit I will not be
[2:37:07] envious of what God blesses somebody

[2:38:40] later don't you let somebody said you

[2:39:09] life well is that a is that a new uh is
[2:39:13] that a new um
[2:39:17] iMac I I i' like sure would like to have
[2:39:20] one of those
[2:39:21] myself you know folks sometimes we ought
[2:39:24] to just keep our heart on what God has
[2:39:27] given
[2:39:33] us and be
[2:39:36] blessed root it
[2:39:38] out root it
[2:39:41] out grub it
[2:39:44] out are you still with me
[2:39:49] musicians are
[2:39:53] coming the lamb and the
[2:39:56] dove the person that would impersonate
[2:39:59] something is the most miserable person
[2:40:02] that I know of isn't it much
[2:40:06] better just to be
[2:40:12] yourself then you don't have to lie to
[2:40:15] your
[2:40:18] wife you you don't have to lie to your
[2:40:21] children you don't have to lie on your
[2:40:25] job he said like Congressman Upshaw used
[2:40:28] to say don't try to be nothing that you
[2:40:32] hate he said well that's pretty good
[2:40:35] don't try to be nothing that you are not
[2:40:38] just be yourself and then if you want to
[2:40:40] be a Christian just ask Christ he'll
[2:40:43] take your own nature
[2:40:45] out he'll put a new nature in then you
[2:40:49] don't have to impersonate anything it's
[2:40:51] just your normal life that you're living
[2:40:55] Christianity is not a put on it's an
[2:40:58] overflow of what's happening in the
[2:41:00] inside and as long as you've got malice
[2:41:03] and envy and strife all these things of
[2:41:05] the world then you know Christ isn't
[2:41:07] there there's one thing you and I need
[2:41:09] to remember and that is the Dove and the
[2:41:12] snake never live in the same
[2:41:16] place the snake has to go for the for
[2:41:20] the dove to
[2:41:21] live now the dove will
[2:41:25] light he'll temporarily park in your
[2:41:29] life brother brandom taught us that that
[2:41:32] the Holy Ghost baptism you you can have
[2:41:35] the Holy Ghost on your
[2:41:37] flesh and not on the inside of the
[2:41:41] inside we want him to come from the
[2:41:43] inside of the inside which I preach
[2:41:46] biblically is the spirit many friends
[2:41:49] preach that biblically it's the soul but
[2:41:52] the soul biblically is that part of you
[2:41:55] that stands between flesh and spirit
[2:41:59] that's where the mind and the will and
[2:42:01] the emotions are how many of you know
[2:42:04] you want the Holy Spirit to come and
[2:42:06] regenerate the Fallen nature of your
[2:42:09] inner man and you want him to start
[2:42:11] winging his way outward Holy Ghost Dove
[2:42:16] get in my mind get in my will get in my
[2:42:21] emotions you don't just want him on your
[2:42:24] flesh you want him to come from the
[2:42:26] inside out and so he might light the
[2:42:30] dove May light on you but you don't want
[2:42:32] him just to sit on your shoulder you
[2:42:34] don't want him just to temporarily and
[2:42:37] occasionally affect you emotionally you
[2:42:39] want him to come from the inside of who
[2:42:42] you are the seed of who you are and work
[2:42:45] his way out so that the serpent can no
[2:42:48] longer live in the control tower of your
[2:42:51] life the Bible said if you love the
[2:42:54] world or the things of the world the
[2:42:56] love of God's not even in you see cuz
[2:42:58] the life of God isn't in you the life is
[2:43:01] in there it just produces itself it just
[2:43:04] lives its way out ain't that
[2:43:09] good we need that don't we in closing
[2:43:12] last one I I I give you my word the
[2:43:16] uncertain
[2:43:18] sound one paragraph and yet the man
[2:43:20] somewhere down in him somewhere in him
[2:43:23] if he could only let that as I
[2:43:25] Illustrated like a button remember I
[2:43:27] read this to you a few months back it's
[2:43:30] like a button when a man is saved that
[2:43:33] much of him is God that's the little
[2:43:35] light that comes in to make him quit
[2:43:37] doing what's wrong now if you can take
[2:43:40] all the malice and envy and strife and
[2:43:42] unbelief out that little button like
[2:43:46] just a little portion of the light and
[2:43:48] power of God guess what'll happen it'll
[2:43:50] keep expanding it'll keep growing and
[2:43:53] growing and growing and growing and
[2:43:57] guess what what it does it crowds out
[2:44:00] unbelief it pushes out the
[2:44:03] envy you start finding out that
[2:44:06] somebody's going to get a new house and
[2:44:08] your heart starts leaping and you say
[2:44:10] thank you
[2:44:13] Jesus I assume my brother and sister are
[2:44:16] tithe payers and God's just keeping his
[2:44:20] promise to open the windows of heaven
[2:44:23] and pour them out a
[2:44:26] blessing and when you can get to that
[2:44:28] place that's that little button of Light
[2:44:30] and Power in you beginning to grow and
[2:44:32] push out all the rest of the go and you
[2:44:35] don't do it by by its exhortations of
[2:44:38] bodily
[2:44:39] exercise you do it by a Sanctified
[2:44:42] consecrated life that the holy spirit
[2:44:45] moves through you I caught some of it in
[2:44:48] a place where where not long ago and he
[2:44:50] goes on to talk about some other things
[2:44:53] how many of you believe you've at least
[2:44:54] got a little button of light in you
[2:44:57] you've repented let's stand you've
[2:44:59] repented you've called on the Lord and
[2:45:01] he's brought you somebody said a mighty
[2:45:04] long way how many of you have come a
[2:45:07] mighty long way since you've been
[2:45:09] journeying for Jesus and how did you get
[2:45:13] here folks you got here by the grace of
[2:45:15] God and how are we going to get to the
[2:45:18] rest of it by the grace of God how are
[2:45:21] we going to get to the place where we
[2:45:23] have no Envy in us and no jealousy in
[2:45:26] us one of the ways to overcome jealousy
[2:45:29] is just start thanking God for what's in
[2:45:31] your life Lord thank you for my wife
[2:45:33] Lord thank you for my children Lord
[2:45:36] thank you for so that if someone comes
[2:45:38] nosing around you don't have to be
[2:45:40] afraid they not going
[2:45:42] anywhere and if you've got Envy going on
[2:45:45] and you just start let me tell you just
[2:45:46] start praising him for what he has given
[2:45:49] you that's right go back and remember a
[2:45:53] time when the refrigerator was almost
[2:45:56] empty and now the refrigerator goes out
[2:45:59] brother uh David we have to go run
[2:46:01] around trying to find you had an extra
[2:46:04] one to grab and bring home we we grabbed
[2:46:07] we have a freezer and a refrigerator
[2:46:09] still in the house but they were full so
[2:46:13] we had to start getting ice chest
[2:46:15] together because we had a part of a
[2:46:17] freezer in the fridge to go out and we
[2:46:20] and and I said look at this
[2:46:22] stuff we had five four or five big ice
[2:46:25] chests refrigerator full a freezer full
[2:46:28] and we're panicking because refrigerator
[2:46:29] goes out I remember a time that I could
[2:46:32] open that refrigerator door sometime in
[2:46:35] my
[2:46:37] life and and there was no no real uh
[2:46:42] dilemma over what to cook or what to eat
[2:46:44] or what to fix it was real simple

[2:46:50] the can cuz there wasn't but three it's

[2:47:01] what to do with have to start giving
[2:47:03] food away so that it doesn't
[2:47:06] spoil focus on that focus on how God has
[2:47:11] brought you through focus on the fact
[2:47:14] that if you weren't always able to buy
[2:47:16] something new for your children that
[2:47:18] somebody thought enough of you to pass
[2:47:20] something to you not out of pity but out
