[1:24:19] today as well brother Shelley asked me
[1:24:22] to pass on to you
[1:24:25] things are a bit uncertain
[1:24:28] and so we're given
[1:24:31] right now uh most likely there'll be a
[1:24:35] graveside service on Wednesday or
[1:24:37] Thursday morning for sister Jane Shelley
[1:24:41] if so brother Shelley will be at church
[1:24:43] on Tuesday night

[1:24:48] and brother Shelley will be here next
[1:24:50] Sunday this all depends on the funeral
[1:24:52] home and so perhaps you'll keep those
[1:24:55] tentative plans in your mind we're just
[1:24:58] believing the Lord to work his Divine
[1:25:01] will and purpose concerning that we just
[1:25:04] want to hold his brother Shelley's
[1:25:05] family up to the Lord I'm glad that his

[1:25:20] each other by the hand of the Lord I'm
[1:25:23] glad to see you in the house of the Lord
[1:25:25] and I so appreciate you pressing in and
[1:25:28] we want to look to the word today as as
[1:25:31] anybody since Tuesday night has anybody
[1:25:34] been doing some transplanting
[1:25:38] some tree moving
[1:25:43] I would like to read today from Malachi
[1:25:46] chapter 3.
[1:25:52] starting with verse one please
[1:25:58] behold
[1:26:00] I will send my messenger and he shall
[1:26:03] prepare the way before me
[1:26:06] and the Lord whom you seek shall
[1:26:08] suddenly come to his Temple even the
[1:26:11] messenger of the Covenant whom you
[1:26:14] Delight in
[1:26:15] behold he shall come saith the Lord of
[1:26:19] hosts
[1:26:20] but who may abide the day of his coming
[1:26:24] and who shall stand when he appeareth
[1:26:27] for he is like a Refiner's Fire
[1:26:30] and like a fuller soap
[1:26:33] and he shall sit as a refiner and a
[1:26:36] purifier of silver and he shall purify
[1:26:39] the sons of Levi and purge them as gold
[1:26:43] and silver that they may offer unto the
[1:26:47] Lord and offering in righteousness
[1:26:51] then shall the offering of Judah and
[1:26:53] Jerusalem be pleasing unto the Lord as
[1:26:56] in the days of old and as in former
[1:26:59] years
[1:27:01] and I will come near to you to judgment
[1:27:04] and I will be a swift witness against
[1:27:07] the sorcerers against the adulterers
[1:27:10] against the false swearers against those
[1:27:14] that oppress the hireling in his wages
[1:27:17] the Widow and the fatherless and that
[1:27:20] turn aside the stranger from his right
[1:27:23] and fear not me saith the Lord of hosts
[1:27:27] for I am the Lord I change not therefore
[1:27:31] you sons of Jacob are not consumed I'm
[1:27:35] going to let you have your seats uh
[1:27:38] you've been standing a long time today
[1:27:41] we're going to continue reading in verse
[1:27:44] 7 even from the days of your father's
[1:27:47] you are gone away from mine ordinances
[1:27:50] and have not kept them
[1:27:52] return unto me and I will return unto
[1:27:55] you saith the Lord of hosts but you have
[1:27:58] said wherein shall we return
[1:28:02] will a man rob God
[1:28:04] yet you have robbed me
[1:28:06] but you say wherein if we robbed thee
[1:28:09] answer in tithe and in offerings
[1:28:13] you're cursed with a curse for you have
[1:28:15] robbed me even this whole nation
[1:28:20] bring ye all the tithe into the
[1:28:22] storehouse that there may be meat in
[1:28:23] mine house and prove me now herewith
[1:28:26] saith the Lord of hosts if I will not
[1:28:29] open you the windows of heaven and pour
[1:28:33] you out a blessing that there shall not
[1:28:37] be room enough to receive it
[1:28:40] and I will rebuke the Devourer for your
[1:28:44] sakes
[1:28:45] and he shall not destroy the fruits of
[1:28:48] your ground neither shall your Vine cast
[1:28:51] our fruit before the time of the field
[1:28:53] in the field saith the Lord of hosts and
[1:28:57] All Nations shall call you blessed for
[1:29:00] you shall be a delightsome land saith
[1:29:04] the Lord of hosts
[1:29:06] he continues your words have been Stout
[1:29:09] against me saith the Lord
[1:29:11] yet you say what have we spoken so much
[1:29:15] against thee
[1:29:17] you have said it is vain to serve God
[1:29:20] and what profit is it that we've kept
[1:29:22] his ordinance and we have walked
[1:29:24] mournfully before the Lord of hosts and
[1:29:27] now we call the proud happy yea they
[1:29:29] that work wickedness are set up yea they
[1:29:33] that tempt God or even delivered
[1:29:35] and they that feared the Lord spake
[1:29:37] often spake often one to another and the
[1:29:41] Lord hearkened and heard it in a book of
[1:29:43] remembrance was written before him for
[1:29:46] them that feared the Lord and that
[1:29:48] thought upon his name
[1:29:50] and they shall be mine saith the Lord of
[1:29:53] hosts in that day when I make up my
[1:29:57] jewels and I will spare them as a man's
[1:30:00] Spirit his own son that serveth him
[1:30:03] then shall you return and discern
[1:30:05] between the righteous and the wicked
[1:30:07] between him that serveth God and him
[1:30:11] that serveth him not
[1:30:14] now
[1:30:16] there's a whole lot in this chapter of
[1:30:19] Malachi 3. and I would like to
[1:30:23] do a little bit of dissecting today and
[1:30:26] and talk about a variety of things
[1:30:28] including continuing where we were at on
[1:30:32] Tuesday night because the thought
[1:30:34] processes that we have we can have them
[1:30:38] either Sanctified or non-sanctified
[1:30:41] and
[1:30:42] this Malachi 3 is what we would call an
[1:30:46] ongoing prophecy it was for a day passed
[1:30:50] it's probably for a day future but
[1:30:53] there's so many things in here that it
[1:30:55] is for uh and now today prophetic word
[1:30:58] for us personally and the Lord wants to
[1:31:01] give us of his word day by day he
[1:31:05] doesn't want us to wait until we just
[1:31:07] come into the house of the Lord and hear
[1:31:09] a preacher preaching it he wants us to
[1:31:12] feed on his word every day uh he wants
[1:31:16] us to to read a word and the enemy would
[1:31:18] try to uh somehow Force us into a
[1:31:23] position where we've got to read a whole
[1:31:26] chapter or more every day when if we
[1:31:29] could get a one verse
[1:31:32] just one verse and chew on it all day
[1:31:35] long just let it ruminate let it be in
[1:31:39] our thoughts age all day long because
[1:31:41] the enemy is pressing in on every side
[1:31:46] trying to force his thoughts into our
[1:31:49] mind but the scripture says let this
[1:31:52] mind be in you which was also in Christ
[1:31:56] Jesus and we cannot have the mind of
[1:32:00] Christ all the while feeding on the
[1:32:03] things of this world
[1:32:05] we're not going to get the proper
[1:32:08] nutrients that we need in our mind in
[1:32:12] our thought processes by feeding on the
[1:32:15] things of the world does that mean that
[1:32:17] we never would see a film or something
[1:32:20] like that no it doesn't mean that it
[1:32:23] just means that we have got to keep our
[1:32:26] mind stayed on the Lord
[1:32:30] we've got to
[1:32:32] so
[1:32:33] these the the the thoughts that God
[1:32:37] gives to us
[1:32:39] uh he wants us to have the word
[1:32:43] this word must be the basis for
[1:32:46] everything that we do our memories are
[1:32:50] not our enemy our imagination is not our
[1:32:53] enemy
[1:32:54] our conscience is not our enemy our
[1:32:58] affections and reasoning are not our
[1:33:00] enemy but they have to be Sanctified
[1:33:04] we've got to put the word to them so
[1:33:08] that everything that when when we're
[1:33:10] thinking and allowing these thoughts
[1:33:13] into our head we've got to have some
[1:33:16] there there are as brother Shelley
[1:33:19] taught us some time ago they are there
[1:33:20] are ants automatic negative thoughts
[1:33:24] these ants try to get in our brain and
[1:33:27] we've got to recognize that the thoughts
[1:33:32] that are coming in is this a thought
[1:33:34] that I need to keep or is it one that
[1:33:37] needs to go is this one I need to
[1:33:40] entertain or is it one that needs to go
[1:33:43] and so as we were preaching here on
[1:33:45] Tuesday night about these trees these
[1:33:49] dendrites and how but God has given us
[1:33:51] the authority by the Holy Ghost to be
[1:33:54] able to speak to the sycamine tree to
[1:33:57] speak to the dendrite to speak to that
[1:33:59] thought you have no permission to stay
[1:34:03] here you are not of God you are not
[1:34:06] going to help me in my journey with the
[1:34:08] Lord and so I speak to you you go and
[1:34:12] you go into that sea where that I can't
[1:34:14] see you no more
[1:34:16] that body of water down in the depths I
[1:34:19] don't want to see you anymore and so no
[1:34:22] after preaching to you on Tuesday night
[1:34:24] Wednesday morning I got tested
[1:34:30] and all through the week got tested
[1:34:34] there were things that happened that
[1:34:36] that can strike anger in you that can
[1:34:39] strike frustration in you that can
[1:34:41] strike all kinds of thought processes
[1:34:43] and it is I as a preacher along with you
[1:34:47] perhaps as lay members we must every one
[1:34:50] of us we have to take control of the
[1:34:54] control of the thought processes that go
[1:34:57] through our mind and we've got to say no
[1:35:00] you don't belong here
[1:35:02] I may have had just had something that
[1:35:04] was very frustrating but it is not going
[1:35:07] to be able to purchase any kind of land
[1:35:12] in my mind
[1:35:15] I reject your offer
[1:35:19] I am counter offering with the word of
[1:35:22] God and the word of God stand ashore
[1:35:26] so
[1:35:28] be transplanted
[1:35:30] you go elsewhere you're not welcome here
[1:35:34] so the prophet Malachi here is
[1:35:38] speaking to God's people
[1:35:40] and he said he says the Lord is coming
[1:35:44] and when he shall come who may abide the
[1:35:49] day of his coming now the word abide
[1:35:54] foreign the Hebrew word is cool
[1:36:06] all right so who may seize or contain or
[1:36:11] measure his coming
[1:36:14] when he comes see God is immeasurable he
[1:36:18] is he is not something that can be
[1:36:20] contained in your little box
[1:36:23] he cannot be contained in the little
[1:36:27] square that you try to make for him or
[1:36:30] that I make for him because I am just
[1:36:33] being honest with you I like my comfort
[1:36:35] zone and when my comfort zone is only
[1:36:37] this big I don't like to go outside of
[1:36:40] it too much and so I I have to allow the
[1:36:43] spirit of God to to to lead me and and
[1:36:46] and I tiptoe maybe outside of my comfort
[1:36:49] zone and I say ah yeah
[1:36:52] [Music]
[1:36:55] and many times in my life I've ended
[1:36:57] back up in my comfort zone
[1:37:00] because I don't like the change
[1:37:04] but it's really it's really a strange
[1:37:08] thing about change
[1:37:11] because we really don't like where we
[1:37:13] are either
[1:37:20] we say we don't like change but we don't
[1:37:23] like where we are
[1:37:25] we don't like the current condition of
[1:37:27] our life and we really do want some
[1:37:29] change
[1:37:31] but when we go outside of the box that
[1:37:34] we've created for ourself it causes us
[1:37:37] distress
[1:37:38] and it causes us all kinds of anxieties
[1:37:42] and all of these kinds you understand
[1:37:44] here once
[1:37:47] you ought to stand here once whether it
[1:37:50] be to preach the word or whether it be
[1:37:51] to lead a service or to lead worship or
[1:37:54] just to stand here with a microphone in
[1:37:56] your hand to give a testimony it's it
[1:37:58] it's you want to call talk about
[1:38:00] anxieties
[1:38:03] because when you are here
[1:38:06] as a leader
[1:38:08] you have a choice to make
[1:38:12] am I going to bring a service to a
[1:38:15] screeching halt because I am I am
[1:38:19] uncomfortable that because we've never
[1:38:22] been this way before am I going to bring
[1:38:25] it to a screeching halt or am I going to
[1:38:28] say okay Holy Ghost you do what you want
[1:38:30] to
[1:38:33] it's necessary for me for brother
[1:38:36] Shelley whoever's leading the sorry it's
[1:38:38] necessary for me to discern whether the
[1:38:41] Holy Ghost wants this to go another
[1:38:43] notch
[1:38:45] or if he's saying all right that's
[1:38:49] enough for now
[1:38:51] let's move on to another song move into
[1:38:54] the word we have to discern those things
[1:38:57] but every service
[1:39:01] God really wants us to step outside of
[1:39:04] our box
[1:39:05] because we do not want this place this
[1:39:10] Revival Center we do not want it to
[1:39:13] become church as usual
[1:39:16] we do not want everything to be cut and
[1:39:19] dry at a certain time it cracks me up
[1:39:22] some of these churches that we're
[1:39:25] associated with on their website they
[1:39:27] give a beginning time and an ending time
[1:39:29] of service
[1:39:31] it's very interesting to me how are you
[1:39:34] going to control the Holy Ghost should
[1:39:36] he break out
[1:39:38] we start at 11 o'clock but if the Holy
[1:39:41] Ghost breaks out and he wants to go till
[1:39:43] four o'clock we have no stop time we
[1:39:47] allow him to do what he wants to we
[1:39:49] allow him to come we know that we as an
[1:39:52] individual cannot contain him in his
[1:39:55] completeness in his totality we would
[1:39:58] explode but we allow him to come and
[1:40:02] abide in US
[1:40:04] can't measure it
[1:40:07] can't seize it because he continues to
[1:40:09] unfold himself I can't contain it and so
[1:40:13] sometimes we act a little strange and
[1:40:15] then we we find ourselves doing things
[1:40:18] that we didn't know we were capable of
[1:40:20] doing we we break out in a dance or jump
[1:40:23] or shout or something that we don't
[1:40:25] normally do because he is not going to
[1:40:29] be contained in our box
[1:40:33] he wants to live in us he wants to abide
[1:40:35] in us he wants to guide us day by day
[1:40:37] but he wants us to allow him by his
[1:40:41] coming to fall on us in whatever measure
[1:40:44] that he decides to fall on us
[1:40:47] and
[1:40:48] then the scripture goes on to say who
[1:40:53] shall stand
[1:40:54] when he appears
[1:41:00] now I can take this two different ways
[1:41:02] the word stand is a mod
[1:41:06] which means to stand in support of
[1:41:10] something
[1:41:12] so when he comes will I be found
[1:41:16] standing in support of what he wants to
[1:41:20] do
[1:41:23] now again this this is going to require
[1:41:27] Discerning of spirits this is going to
[1:41:30] require that I allow the spirit of God
[1:41:34] to work in me till that I can discern
[1:41:36] whether this is what he wants to do or
[1:41:40] whether it's not and so I have got to
[1:41:43] allow him to work in me and will he come
[1:41:47] and find me standing in support of
[1:41:50] whatever he wants to do
[1:41:52] [Applause]
[1:41:55] now I can take this another way because
[1:41:58] we have had prophetic word here where
[1:42:01] that God was going to come in such a way
[1:42:04] in such a heavy Glory till that there
[1:42:06] wouldn't be one that would be standing
[1:42:07] we would be all on our faces
[1:42:09] hello so I can take this scripture in
[1:42:13] another way till that who will be able
[1:42:15] to stand when he comes
[1:42:19] now this is where we contrast praise and
[1:42:23] worship
[1:42:25] praise is exuberant praise is the loud
[1:42:29] voice praises the shouting and the
[1:42:32] speaking in tongues and the jumping up
[1:42:34] and down and singing with a loud voice
[1:42:36] but when it transitions into worship
[1:42:42] it comes a little quieter
[1:42:44] our voices may still be raised but
[1:42:46] there's a different there's a there's a
[1:42:48] shift in the atmosphere when we enter
[1:42:51] into worship because the worship can
[1:42:54] lead to the glory of the Lord coming
[1:42:56] down until then none of us would be able
[1:42:58] to stand in his presence
[1:43:00] I want to be found standing on his side
[1:43:03] when the line is drawn in the sand I
[1:43:07] want to be found standing on his side
[1:43:09] but if he should come in all of his
[1:43:11] glory and drop in this place or in my
[1:43:14] living room or wherever I may be I want
[1:43:17] to be willing to fall
[1:43:20] I want to be willing to bury my nose in
[1:43:23] the carpet I want to be willing I don't
[1:43:25] want to be found a grease spot
[1:43:28] at the end of the day should he come and
[1:43:30] I find myself resisting him
[1:43:35] so who can abide and who is going to
[1:43:38] stand
[1:43:39] when he appears
[1:43:41] for he is like a Refiner's Fire and like
[1:43:45] Fuller soap
[1:43:48] refiners fire
[1:43:55] we have been found saying Lord Let the
[1:43:58] Fire Fall
[1:44:00] we want the fire to fall
[1:44:04] refiners fire
[1:44:06] is mighty hot
[1:44:09] what I can understand it's between 1600
[1:44:11] and 1800 degrees Fahrenheit
[1:44:14] kind of warm
[1:44:16] because when a refiner is working with
[1:44:20] metal
[1:44:21] and they're trying to meld it down it
[1:44:24] takes an intense heat in order for them
[1:44:28] to melt the metal down so that as this
[1:44:32] metal is all melted the dross
[1:44:35] the stuff that is not pure metal can
[1:44:38] come to the top and it can be skimmed
[1:44:41] off so when God comes as a Refiner's
[1:44:44] Fire in your life he is coming because
[1:44:47] he wants to be able to melt you down to
[1:44:51] nothing
[1:44:54] till you are total fluid
[1:44:58] till that you are no longer resisting
[1:45:01] but you're just fluid
[1:45:03] [Music]
[1:45:04] and then he can take his holy ghost word
[1:45:08] and he can skim off of the top of you
[1:45:11] all of the dross all of the impurities
[1:45:17] many times we think that we're in a hot
[1:45:19] fire
[1:45:21] and we try to get out of that fire you
[1:45:24] remember when when those uh he three
[1:45:26] Hebrew boys they were uh they were told
[1:45:29] that they had to Bow before the image of
[1:45:32] the prophet
[1:45:34] that's what it was an image to the
[1:45:37] prophet Daniel had gained such notoriety
[1:45:40] in the Kingdom until that he had such
[1:45:44] Prestige and such honor with the King
[1:45:47] that the king decided to make this great
[1:45:49] golden statue of the Prophet Daniel and
[1:45:53] the Prophet Daniel he didn't want it
[1:45:55] he didn't like it
[1:45:59] but now the king is telling everybody
[1:46:02] you've got to Bow before this this image
[1:46:06] you've got to Bow before it and those
[1:46:08] three Hebrew children they had come from
[1:46:11] a culture of believing that there was
[1:46:14] just one that deserved reverence and
[1:46:16] that was God in heaven the creator of
[1:46:19] man
[1:46:20] they came from the same background as
[1:46:22] Daniel came from they were all friends
[1:46:25] they were Brethren they were working
[1:46:26] together and they were in a they were in
[1:46:29] a culture of paganism
[1:46:33] and they were doing their best to stay
[1:46:36] true to God while in the confines of
[1:46:40] this culture of paganism
[1:46:42] so are we
[1:46:47] well we find ourselves being tainted by
[1:46:51] the culture of paganism rather than as
[1:46:54] these boys did to draw back you remember
[1:46:57] when they were taken into this culture
[1:47:00] of paganism that they were offered some
[1:47:03] to eat and something to drink
[1:47:07] and they could have been fearful knowing
[1:47:10] that they could lose their heads at any
[1:47:12] moment because they were not in their
[1:47:14] own country but now they are presenting
[1:47:17] themselves before that the the gentleman
[1:47:20] the the eunuch That Was preparing their
[1:47:23] food and he's telling them this is what
[1:47:26] the king says that you've got to eat
[1:47:30] see there's plenty of people trying to
[1:47:32] tell you that's what you've got to eat
[1:47:35] you've got to eat all this stuff that
[1:47:37] the world is trying to present to you
[1:47:41] but these boys said sir
[1:47:45] we mean no disrespect
[1:47:49] but our God has told us that we are not
[1:47:52] to partake of that stuff and and we're
[1:47:55] requesting that you would just try it
[1:47:58] for a certain number of days and give us
[1:48:01] a different diet and see if if if you at
[1:48:06] the end of that time period if you would
[1:48:09] find that we would still be strong
[1:48:11] enough and our complexion would be good
[1:48:13] and that everything would be all right
[1:48:15] that we would not have to defile
[1:48:17] ourselves with the king's meat
[1:48:20] and then this eunuch this this one that
[1:48:22] was there uh watching over them he
[1:48:25] begins to
[1:48:26] recognize well perhaps I could just give
[1:48:30] them 10 days perhaps I could give them a
[1:48:33] period of time and we'll just see how
[1:48:35] this works out I don't really have to
[1:48:37] tell the king that they've refused his
[1:48:39] dinner uh perhaps we can just try this
[1:48:42] out for a little while and so they try
[1:48:45] this out for a certain period of time
[1:48:46] and at the end of that period of time
[1:48:48] this this the the the keeper of these
[1:48:52] men they wreck it he recognizes that
[1:48:55] they are faring better than those that
[1:48:59] are getting the king's meat
[1:49:04] now whether it was nutrition or whether
[1:49:07] it was because God blessed what they did
[1:49:10] and what they requested and because that
[1:49:12] he honored their willingness in a pagan
[1:49:16] culture to be able to stand against the
[1:49:19] the the the the times to stand against
[1:49:22] what they were being offered to say uh I
[1:49:26] don't really want to partake of that and
[1:49:28] so I am humbly asking that I can have a
[1:49:31] different diet that I can have a
[1:49:33] different uh thing to eat and God
[1:49:36] honored that
[1:49:37] and he let them fare better now because
[1:49:42] of their God blessing them
[1:49:46] and bringing them to a place of
[1:49:48] prominence in the Kingdom
[1:49:50] these weren't just a bunch of nobodies
[1:49:53] that stood out in the middle of this
[1:49:55] group of people that were bowing before
[1:49:57] this image these are men that have been
[1:49:59] looked up to they've got a little bit of
[1:50:01] uh prestige in the Kingdom they've got
[1:50:04] people that look up to them and come to
[1:50:06] them for answers and now they're
[1:50:09] standing there
[1:50:11] probably with their backs turned to this
[1:50:14] image they were refusing once again the
[1:50:17] king's commandment
[1:50:20] and as they refused the king's
[1:50:23] commandment
[1:50:24] they
[1:50:25] are not they they don't have the keeper
[1:50:29] of the men there to be able to say Sir
[1:50:32] um
[1:50:33] this image is uh
[1:50:36] um we don't do that
[1:50:38] and and we really don't want to bow down
[1:50:41] to that image and that's that's our
[1:50:43] that's our brother and we don't want to
[1:50:45] bow down to the image of Daniel and
[1:50:49] we just would rather that you would let
[1:50:52] us go hide in our offices and and not
[1:50:55] make a spectacle of of what we're doing
[1:50:58] and you know there's there's really no
[1:51:00] reason to stir up a lot of trouble uh
[1:51:03] perhaps we could we could come up with
[1:51:05] you know we could come up with a
[1:51:07] alternative we could come up with
[1:51:09] something different here but no
[1:51:12] God was allowing this test
[1:51:16] because these gentlemen had already
[1:51:19] passed some other tests
[1:51:21] they had already gone through some other
[1:51:24] fiery trials in their life and so now
[1:51:27] they were coming up to a real refiners
[1:51:29] fire
[1:51:30] one that was heated seven times hotter
[1:51:33] than it had ever been heated before and
[1:51:35] now they they were even given a second
[1:51:38] chance we're you know when when all of
[1:51:41] this music starts if you're willing to
[1:51:43] bow down to this image we'll let you off
[1:51:46] the hook and and you'll be you you can
[1:51:49] be okay and they said
[1:51:51] you can do what you want to do
[1:51:53] and whether our father delivers us out
[1:51:56] of the heat of this fiery furnace I
[1:51:58] don't know whether he will or whether he
[1:52:00] won't but nevertheless I am not willing
[1:52:03] to bow down as you have requested before
[1:52:06] this image of the Prophet I am one who
[1:52:09] realizes that this is idolatry and I'm
[1:52:12] not going to do it
[1:52:16] now see this makes people mad
[1:52:18] I mean this made the king mad
[1:52:23] this maze the king mad
[1:52:27] because he gave a commandment
[1:52:31] see hierarchies give Commandments and
[1:52:34] they think you need to bow down before
[1:52:36] their their idol worship
[1:52:39] but there is a group of people who have
[1:52:42] stepped outside of their box and said I
[1:52:45] have come this far leaning on the Lord I
[1:52:49] have come this far by Grace I have come
[1:52:52] through this many fiery trials and maybe
[1:52:55] it was not as hot as that furnace is but
[1:52:59] he's brought me through all of the other
[1:53:01] ones
[1:53:02] and he told me
[1:53:04] in the New Testament that these fiery
[1:53:07] trials were for my benefit because he
[1:53:10] was trying me to make me like pure gold
[1:53:16] so
[1:53:19] this fire
[1:53:21] the refiners fire
[1:53:24] Shadrach Meshach Abednego
[1:53:28] they were you know it's it's it's a it's
[1:53:31] as I stand here
[1:53:34] I find it really a shame on my part
[1:53:38] that I remember their Pagan names
[1:53:41] and not their Hebrew names
[1:53:46] Michelle
[1:53:47] that right it's one of them
[1:53:52] but that's their Pagan name Shadrach
[1:53:53] Meshach and Abednego
[1:53:56] but they had Hebrew names
[1:53:59] remember Daniel's name was changed to
[1:54:01] beltasher
[1:54:03] we remember Daniel's name
[1:54:06] but these boys they went into this fiery
[1:54:09] furnace
[1:54:10] and they were they went in Bound the men
[1:54:16] that threw them in the fire was so hot
[1:54:19] that they lost their lives the men that
[1:54:22] were throwing them in lost their lives
[1:54:24] yet these three Hebrew boys they went in
[1:54:27] and all of the fire did was loose their
[1:54:30] bob bob their loose their ropes from off
[1:54:32] of them so that they could walk around
[1:54:34] freely
[1:54:36] but what they found when they got inside
[1:54:38] the fire was uh like the the king says
[1:54:43] like unto the son of God
[1:54:46] there was there was something in that
[1:54:49] fire there was someone in that fire and
[1:54:52] it's the same someone that will help you
[1:54:54] in your fiery furnace
[1:54:57] when you're going through the refiners
[1:54:59] fire
[1:55:01] he will help you to go through it
[1:55:03] Revelation Chapter 3 Verse 18 he says I
[1:55:06] counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in
[1:55:10] the fire that thou mayest be rich and
[1:55:13] white raiment that thou mayest be
[1:55:15] clothed
[1:55:17] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[1:55:19] not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[1:55:21] isaf that thou mayest see
[1:55:25] the other thing that he said that he was
[1:55:27] going to
[1:55:27] offer to us to them and to us that when
[1:55:32] he when he appeared it was going to be
[1:55:34] like a Fuller's Soap
[1:55:38] a fuller
[1:55:40] or a borit
[1:55:43] is one who presses
[1:55:45] or widens cloth
[1:55:48] by pounding it with one's feet
[1:55:51] hands or a club
[1:55:55] to rid it of its impurities
[1:55:59] now this I'm telling you this sounds
[1:56:01] real Pleasant doesn't it
[1:56:04] and a soap or an Alkali From the Ashes
[1:56:09] of a plant
[1:56:10] macabushim
[1:56:12] is used to bleach the cloth
[1:56:16] so we have
[1:56:18] the soap
[1:56:21] which is to bleach
[1:56:23] and I just figure that if you're going
[1:56:27] to get the Fuller soap you're going to
[1:56:29] get the Fuller too
[1:56:31] so you're going to get the whitening but
[1:56:34] you're also going to get the pounding
[1:56:36] and The Stomping
[1:56:40] this sounds like such a delightful
[1:56:41] Journey doesn't it
[1:56:45] don't fear you've been walking through
[1:56:47] it your whole life
[1:56:50] it intensified when you gave your heart
[1:56:52] to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:56:54] and if you haven't given your heart to
[1:56:56] the Lord Jesus Christ it will intensify
[1:56:59] and if you move here it will intensify
[1:57:02] because this is a Revival Center and
[1:57:05] we're pursuing Revival and when you
[1:57:07] pursue Revival and when you pursue the
[1:57:10] purposes of God no matter where you are
[1:57:13] it intensifies
[1:57:15] the fire intensifies and the pounding
[1:57:19] intensifies
[1:57:22] but the whitening also has to intensify
[1:57:27] because there are things inside of me
[1:57:32] as we have said before that I cannot
[1:57:35] currently see
[1:57:38] there are things when I came to the Lord
[1:57:40] Jesus Christ I repented of them he
[1:57:45] allowed me to see them
[1:57:48] and then as I continued my journey there
[1:57:51] were things there that I yet could not
[1:57:53] see that needed to be gotten out of my
[1:57:55] life there were things that needed to be
[1:57:57] purified by the Fuller soap and by the
[1:58:00] refining fire and so the Lord allowed
[1:58:03] this process whereby he brought it to
[1:58:07] the surface as the dross
[1:58:10] and he allows me to see it
[1:58:15] and then I have a choice
[1:58:22] will I bring myself out of the fire
[1:58:26] and let it Harden back together as
[1:58:29] impure metal
[1:58:30] or will I say
[1:58:33] I give it to you Lord
[1:58:38] now
[1:58:41] most of us around here know this is not
[1:58:44] a once and done process
[1:58:49] it is a continual process
[1:58:53] now there are times in our life where we
[1:58:55] feel like that we're in an intense
[1:58:56] furnace and there are other times where
[1:58:58] that it doesn't feel so hot yet we are
[1:59:01] in the we are in the process of the
[1:59:04] spirit of the Lord working with us to be
[1:59:07] able to bring us into his stature Into
[1:59:09] His Image so that he can do fully with
[1:59:12] us what he wants to do
[1:59:15] now we uh I think it was last Sunday we
[1:59:18] talked about how that David was a man
[1:59:21] after God's Own Heart he was one who uh
[1:59:25] allowed the Lord to work in him but
[1:59:28] there came a season of his life whether
[1:59:30] he sent others out to fight the spring
[1:59:32] battles he did not go as he generally
[1:59:35] did and he found himself in an
[1:59:37] adulterous mess
[1:59:41] and he found himself
[1:59:45] he didn't know
[1:59:48] he didn't know
[1:59:51] when
[1:59:52] he went up when he didn't go out to
[1:59:55] fight
[1:59:56] he didn't know he was going to find
[1:59:57] himself on a rooftop
[2:00:00] looking at another man's wife
[2:00:07] when he chose to commit adultery he
[2:00:09] didn't know
[2:00:10] he was going to have an illegitimate
[2:00:12] child
[2:00:15] or that he was going to have to kill a
[2:00:16] man have a man killed to try to hide his
[2:00:19] sin
[2:00:21] or that he was going to have the loss of
[2:00:23] a child
[2:00:25] sin will lead you farther than you want
[2:00:27] to go
[2:00:28] and it'll leave you longer than you want
[2:00:31] to stay and it'll cost you way more than
[2:00:35] you want to pay
[2:00:38] but there was something in David
[2:00:42] when he came back to the Lord
[2:00:45] Psalm 51 have mercy upon me o God
[2:00:50] according to thy loving-kindness
[2:00:53] according under the multitude of thy
[2:00:55] Tender Mercies blot out my
[2:00:57] transgressions
[2:00:59] Wash Me thoroughly from my iniquity and
[2:01:02] cleanse me from my sin
[2:01:05] for I acknowledge my transgressions and
[2:01:08] my sin is ever before me
[2:01:10] against thee and the only have I sinned
[2:01:14] and done this evil in thy sight
[2:01:18] thou mightest be justified when thou
[2:01:20] speakest and be clear when thou judgest
[2:01:24] behold I was shapen in iniquity
[2:01:27] and in sin did my mother conceive me
[2:01:30] behold thou desirest truth in the inward
[2:01:33] parts and in the hidden part Thou shalt
[2:01:36] make me to know wisdom
[2:01:39] Purge me with hyssop and I shall be
[2:01:42] clean
[2:01:43] wash me and I shall be whiter than snow
[2:01:47] now David knew about Fuller soap
[2:01:52] he knew about the cleansing power of the
[2:01:55] law of of the most high God he did not
[2:01:59] yet have the blessing of knowing the the
[2:02:02] the fullness
[2:02:04] the messiah's work in shedding his blood
[2:02:07] for the remission of sin that sin could
[2:02:10] be annihilated but he knew where to go
[2:02:13] he knew where to run to when he was in a
[2:02:16] quandary with his own life and he was a
[2:02:19] miserable failure in all of his dealings
[2:02:24] because he had tried to satisfied
[2:02:29] his own flesh
[2:02:31] now he's
[2:02:34] coming to the Lord after all of the
[2:02:37] misery all of the loss and all of the
[2:02:41] the shame and the guilt of having
[2:02:43] someone killed and the shame of
[2:02:47] adulterous Affair and all of this kind
[2:02:49] of stuff and he brings it before the
[2:02:51] Lord and he says Wash Me
[2:02:54] now I found an interesting
[2:02:57] take on
[2:02:59] um
[2:03:01] Naomi in the Book of Ruth
[2:03:04] and this is taken from an article by
[2:03:06] Heim Ventura
[2:03:09] and he says Naomi in the Book of Ruth
[2:03:11] who wanted to be called Mara
[2:03:14] because she was bitter
[2:03:16] and the Lord
[2:03:18] marar or dealt bitterly with her
[2:03:23] and this writer says he never liked the
[2:03:25] idea of God dealing bitterly with
[2:03:27] someone and so he gives a different
[2:03:28] perspective here he said besides that it
[2:03:31] appears that this godly woman was
[2:03:32] looking for sympathy
[2:03:35] I thought that
[2:03:38] he says but when I studied the word
[2:03:40] marar m-a-r-a-r or bitter
[2:03:44] I found its Semitic origins in the word
[2:03:48] for bile
[2:03:49] that acid taste that comes to your mouth
[2:03:52] when you're spitting up
[2:03:53] yet this also comes from the same root
[2:03:56] as mura
[2:03:58] which is a sweet perfume or essential
[2:04:01] oil used for medicinal purposes
[2:04:05] Mira or Myra
[2:04:08] m-y-r-r-a-h was used to soothe skin
[2:04:12] abrasions
[2:04:14] so when God said that so when Naomi said
[2:04:18] that God was dealing bitterly with her
[2:04:21] she was making a play on words here
[2:04:24] she was asked to be called Mara not
[2:04:27] because she wanted sympathy but that she
[2:04:30] did not want sympathy she was declaring
[2:04:33] that she was being cleansed by borit
[2:04:37] macabsham or Fuller soap
[2:04:40] God was putting her through a cleansing
[2:04:43] process that was not pleasant but don't
[2:04:46] feel sorry for Naomi because this was
[2:04:48] only a process to help to cleanse her
[2:04:51] and make her pure
[2:04:54] those of you that may not be familiar
[2:04:56] with Naomi and the Book of Ruth and how
[2:04:58] that that her husband there was a famine
[2:05:01] in the land and her husband took uh he
[2:05:05] and Naomi and the sons they went to Moab
[2:05:08] and there the boys found wives and in
[2:05:12] the process of time the husband dies and
[2:05:14] then the two boys die and now Naomi is
[2:05:19] left with her two daughters-in-law
[2:05:22] and Naomi comes to a realize I'm in a
[2:05:26] wrong place
[2:05:28] wrong place
[2:05:31] I've got to get back to the house of
[2:05:34] God's bread I've got to get back there
[2:05:37] and so she proceeds to tell her two
[2:05:39] daughters-in-law who have also had loss
[2:05:42] they lost their husbands
[2:05:45] she proceeds to tell them
[2:05:49] Ruth and orpah I'm going back
[2:05:52] to my home where I belong
[2:05:56] this place is not my home I'm going back
[2:05:59] where I belong
[2:06:02] and you girls need to go back to your
[2:06:04] father's houses
[2:06:06] orpa
[2:06:08] chose to go back to her father's house
[2:06:11] but Ruth
[2:06:13] said not so
[2:06:15] where you go I'm going
[2:06:18] I have nothing back at my father's house
[2:06:20] that's pulling me that's tempting me
[2:06:22] nothing back there that I want to go to
[2:06:24] there's something on the inside of me
[2:06:27] I've been listening to your words Naomi
[2:06:29] I know you've had bitterness in your
[2:06:31] life I know you've had lost but I've
[2:06:33] been listening to the gospel message
[2:06:36] that you've been telling me that is why
[2:06:38] friends that we cannot neglect our
[2:06:41] senior uh our seniors Among Us
[2:06:45] you younger women you can learn from
[2:06:48] these Elder women
[2:06:49] they have understanding they have
[2:06:52] knowledge that you can learn from you
[2:06:54] don't need to disregard it you need to
[2:06:57] take it to heart because they as Naomi
[2:06:59] have been through some trials they've
[2:07:02] been through some tough places they've
[2:07:04] been through some real fiery trials and
[2:07:07] they can offer you something that would
[2:07:09] keep you out of going through the same
[2:07:11] pain the same tragedies that they went
[2:07:14] through
[2:07:15] you younger girls
[2:07:18] teenagers growing up to marriageable and
[2:07:21] even you young mothers
[2:07:23] there's something that these senior
[2:07:25] women
[2:07:26] can you can learn from
[2:07:29] and Ruth recognized that Naomi was one
[2:07:33] of those that she could learn from and
[2:07:35] she says I'm not going anywhere where
[2:07:37] but where you go where you go I'm gonna
[2:07:39] go
[2:07:41] your God is going to be my God
[2:07:43] where are you lodged that's where I'm
[2:07:45] gonna Lodge I'm going with you wherever
[2:07:48] you go and so now as God has taken Naomi
[2:07:52] through this this fiery process and
[2:07:55] allowed the Fuller Soul the the the
[2:07:58] bitterness of Life how whichever way you
[2:08:00] wish to look at it now she goes back to
[2:08:03] the land of her origin and we know that
[2:08:06] God has a beautiful plan that he is
[2:08:08] working out
[2:08:10] where that he is now again blending Jew
[2:08:13] and Gentile together
[2:08:16] to give a picture of the one new man
[2:08:22] Ruth a moabitus
[2:08:28] times I laugh Within Myself
[2:08:31] a chuckle to think about
[2:08:35] what it must have been like
[2:08:38] terrifying No Doubt
[2:08:41] when Naomi said to Ruth
[2:08:44] Boaz ain't getting it
[2:08:48] he just really ain't getting it you're
[2:08:50] gonna have to go down to the threshing
[2:08:51] floor
[2:08:52] and this is what you've got to do
[2:08:58] Ruth had confidence in that older woman
[2:09:03] she had confidence in Naomi that Naomi
[2:09:07] wasn't going to steer her wrong
[2:09:09] Naomi was given her advice that in in
[2:09:13] 2023 culture sounds outlandish it sounds
[2:09:17] crazy and maybe it was crazy then I
[2:09:20] don't know it probably was yet naor Ruth
[2:09:24] had a confidence in the in the
[2:09:26] instruction of Naomi that she would say
[2:09:30] okay I will go down and I will do what
[2:09:33] you're saying and no doubt that she's
[2:09:35] going down after dark to the threshing
[2:09:38] floor where all of these men are laying
[2:09:40] around where the where the wheat has
[2:09:42] been threshed out and there's big piles
[2:09:45] no doubt and Ruth
[2:09:48] slips herself under the edge of boys's
[2:09:52] garment
[2:09:55] and in a while Boaz realizes somebody's
[2:09:58] at his feet
[2:10:02] and she probably was terrified all over
[2:10:05] again as she has to reveal herself think
[2:10:08] about the number of terrifying incidents
[2:10:10] that Ruth went the first one was to even
[2:10:13] get the courage to do what Naomi was
[2:10:15] saying the second was to go through the
[2:10:17] dark by herself to get to the threshing
[2:10:19] floor and find the right man
[2:10:22] then to put herself at the feet of a man
[2:10:24] that she barely knew
[2:10:26] and then to reveal herself when Boaz
[2:10:29] woke up
[2:10:30] but when she walked away from that place
[2:10:33] she had a bundle in her hand
[2:10:36] and I think that she probably had a
[2:10:38] little bit more confidence and when she
[2:10:40] walked into the house of that older
[2:10:42] woman Naomi who had been through a grief
[2:10:45] she'd been through tragedy Naomi had
[2:10:47] been through bitterness of her own she
[2:10:49] had been through a Refiner's Fire she
[2:10:51] had been through the part where she felt
[2:10:54] like that she'd been stomped on and
[2:10:56] pushed against and washed with a fuller
[2:10:59] soap one that was bleaching
[2:11:04] and she probably felt at times like her
[2:11:06] bones were bleached out
[2:11:09] but yet when Ruth walked through that
[2:11:12] door
[2:11:13] and she had that bundle on her side
[2:11:16] Naomi knew that God was about to do
[2:11:20] something spectacular she probably
[2:11:22] didn't know the totality of what was
[2:11:25] about to happen but she knew that Boaz
[2:11:27] would not rest until that he took care
[2:11:30] of all of that Redemption all of that
[2:11:32] kinship all of that redeeming hell Naomi
[2:11:36] and her household back to their rightful
[2:11:38] position where the Naomi had all of her
[2:11:41] possessions back in her hands was hers
[2:11:44] Boaz redeemed it
[2:11:47] the Kinsmen Redeemer
[2:11:51] and God is doing the same thing for you
[2:11:54] he's doing the same thing for me as we
[2:11:57] go through these refiners fires as we go
[2:11:59] through this bleaching process being
[2:12:02] stomped on feeling like that nobody
[2:12:05] cares about us going through times when
[2:12:07] we feel like that nobody understands the
[2:12:10] bitterness of life that we've gone
[2:12:12] through yet God is working it to bring
[2:12:15] about a complete Redemption process in
[2:12:19] our lives
[2:12:23] foreign
[2:12:25] 48 verses 9 through 11.
[2:12:29] for my name's sake will I defer my anger
[2:12:32] and for my praise will I refrain for
[2:12:35] thee that I cut thee not off
[2:12:38] behold I have refined thee but not with
[2:12:43] silver
[2:12:44] I have chosen thee in the furnace of
[2:12:47] affliction
[2:12:49] for my own sake even for my own sake
[2:12:53] will I do it for how should my name be
[2:12:57] polluted
[2:12:58] and I will not give my glory to another
[2:13:04] how many times
[2:13:07] have we in our pride and our arrogance
[2:13:10] tried to steal the glory of the Lord
[2:13:15] God's not going to have it
[2:13:17] he's not
[2:13:19] that's why he's taken us through these
[2:13:21] refiners fires
[2:13:22] because he's going to get all of the
[2:13:25] dross all of the uncleanness he's going
[2:13:27] to take it out of us
[2:13:29] now the refining has a very specific
[2:13:32] purpose
[2:13:35] he goes on to say as in the days
[2:13:39] uh of old Judah and Jerusalem will be an
[2:13:44] offering pleasing to the Lord King James
[2:13:46] reads then shall the offering of Judah
[2:13:49] and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord
[2:13:51] as in the days of old and as in former
[2:13:54] years so in days of old or as in days of
[2:13:58] old Judah and Jerusalem will be an
[2:14:02] offering pleasing to the Lord when they
[2:14:05] first got to the land of Israel when
[2:14:07] they were first taken it over they were
[2:14:09] Conquering the land it was theirs and
[2:14:12] they were under the they were under the
[2:14:14] leadership of of of these Kings and then
[2:14:18] David and David was a man after God's
[2:14:21] Own Heart and it was a place that was
[2:14:23] pleasing to the Lord and then as time
[2:14:26] went on they got away from the
[2:14:28] Commandments of the Lord they got away
[2:14:30] from the peace of God they got away from
[2:14:34] the praising of the Lord they got away
[2:14:38] from all of those instructions that they
[2:14:40] had been given in time past
[2:14:43] and so
[2:14:45] God comes along and he says I am going
[2:14:48] to renew I'm going to restore the Judah
[2:14:52] and Jerusalem are going to be as in the
[2:14:54] days of old they're going to be that
[2:14:57] they're they're going to be an offering
[2:14:59] pleasing to the Lord
[2:15:03] now
[2:15:04] Judah meaning praise
[2:15:06] Jerusalem meaning peace
[2:15:16] he will put you
[2:15:18] in perfect peace
[2:15:21] whose mind
[2:15:25] here we're going to go back to these
[2:15:26] trees
[2:15:28] he will keep you in perfect peace whose
[2:15:31] mind is stayed upon him
[2:15:35] we don't stay in perfect peace because
[2:15:38] we don't keep our minds on him
[2:15:41] but he is Desiring to bring us back to
[2:15:45] the place of old where like when we
[2:15:47] first got saved and everything was
[2:15:49] beautiful and everything was pleasant
[2:15:51] and we walked in a in a honeymoon so to
[2:15:54] speak we walked in a place of joy and
[2:15:57] that's where he wants to bring you to
[2:15:59] but it's as the fiery trials have come
[2:16:02] along you've
[2:16:04] picked up some bitterness
[2:16:08] you've picked up some anger
[2:16:10] you've picked up some resentment
[2:16:13] now I'm not putting anything on you
[2:16:15] don't don't take it that way I'm just
[2:16:17] naming off some of the things that we've
[2:16:19] experienced through the years that have
[2:16:22] caused us to be pulled away from our
[2:16:24] peace
[2:16:25] and they've caused us to be pulled away
[2:16:27] from our praise
[2:16:30] but God would like to restore us to that
[2:16:33] that old Jerusalem and Judah he would
[2:16:37] like to bring us to a place once again
[2:16:39] where we have our praise and we have our
[2:16:43] peace and the way that he does that is
[2:16:46] to take us through a Refiner's Fire and
[2:16:49] a fuller soap to wash us white and clean
[2:16:51] and to get all of the dross out of us to
[2:16:54] get all of that stuff out of us
[2:16:57] to where that we are allowing him
[2:17:02] to
[2:17:03] bring us to peace
[2:17:06] with our praise
[2:17:12] every one of us could name something
[2:17:16] probably this week that has pulled us
[2:17:19] out of our peace
[2:17:21] whether it was momentarily
[2:17:24] or whether it was for an extended period
[2:17:26] of time
[2:17:28] and so then we have to take the word
[2:17:33] that we have heard where Jesus said if
[2:17:36] you say
[2:17:37] to this sycamine tree
[2:17:40] if you say
[2:17:43] to this dendrite if you say to that
[2:17:46] prickly thorn bush
[2:17:48] you see Jesus gave another analogy as we
[2:17:52] mentioned on Tuesday night where he came
[2:17:55] along and he said if it's a good tree
[2:17:58] makes the fruit good
[2:18:01] and then in another place he told us
[2:18:03] that there was a necessity for the
[2:18:06] pruner to come along and trim off some
[2:18:09] branches
[2:18:11] that had no life in them
[2:18:13] they were really imposters that were
[2:18:16] trying to produce a fruit that was not
[2:18:19] for the good tree
[2:18:21] but you have been chosen to be a good
[2:18:24] tree to produce good fruit
[2:18:28] to the honor and praise of the Lord
[2:18:30] Jesus Christ
[2:18:32] and so it is of necessity that I a
[2:18:35] Believer go and allow the spirit to trim
[2:18:38] them off to take what I have been given
[2:18:41] see because we we want to sit back
[2:18:44] sometimes or in time past maybe we want
[2:18:48] to sit back and say okay Lord you do it
[2:18:51] but he wants our cooperation
[2:19:05] now this may sound off the wall
[2:19:07] but it's almost like he wants us to
[2:19:09] inflict our own pain
[2:19:15] because we've got to agree with him that
[2:19:18] he will be able to prune us
[2:19:20] [Music]
[2:19:21] we have to agree with him to say tree be
[2:19:24] gone this is not something that I need
[2:19:27] in my life
[2:19:30] it's
[2:19:32] absurd
[2:19:34] that we through the years
[2:19:38] have
[2:19:39] given real estate
[2:19:43] to horrible toxic thoughts
[2:19:50] and we entertain them
[2:19:54] and we petted them and we
[2:19:58] had pity parties for ourselves about
[2:20:01] them
[2:20:02] because we thought that it was our do
[2:20:06] justice
[2:20:08] that we should be allowed to hold on to
[2:20:11] all of these things whether it be on
[2:20:13] forgiveness or bitterness or anger or
[2:20:15] Strife or resentment or a bad childhood
[2:20:18] or whatever it was
[2:20:23] I'm do it
[2:20:30] let me let me Waller one more day
[2:20:35] no we would never use those words
[2:20:40] but that is the thought we give forth
[2:20:44] when we're given the word to speak to
[2:20:47] these trees to put them in this Bottom
[2:20:51] of the Sea because I've been given the
[2:20:53] authority by the word of God to say to
[2:20:55] my sick of mine trees be thou plucked up
[2:20:58] by the root I don't want to cut you at
[2:21:00] the base I want to pluck you out by the
[2:21:03] root I don't want any root of bitterness
[2:21:06] to be stuck in my mind to cause me to go
[2:21:09] back to and then shoot start sprigging
[2:21:12] up out of it
[2:21:13] and I got to deal with it again no we've
[2:21:16] got to say to this sycamine tree you
[2:21:18] root of bitterness you get out of my
[2:21:20] life and then you go into the depths of
[2:21:22] the sea I don't want you anymore
[2:21:25] God gave us these tools to work with
[2:21:30] and the furnace of affliction
[2:21:33] is heard what he's using the Fuller soap
[2:21:37] because he wants to call you back to
[2:21:39] your place of praise and he wants to
[2:21:42] call you back to peace
[2:21:44] then he said he was going to come near
[2:21:48] oh
[2:21:49] then he said he was going to come near
[2:21:52] to you to judgment
[2:21:55] and he gives a list of seven things that
[2:21:57] he's going to be a swift witness against
[2:22:00] number one he's going to be a witness
[2:22:02] against the sorcerers number two against
[2:22:04] the adulterers number three against
[2:22:06] false swears number four against those
[2:22:09] who oppress the wages of the hireling
[2:22:12] number five those who oppress the
[2:22:14] fatherless number six those who turn
[2:22:17] aside from the stranger and number seven
[2:22:19] those who fear me not saith the Lord
[2:22:22] seven things that he was going to say
[2:22:24] that he said he was going to be a swift
[2:22:26] witness against
[2:22:28] now sorcerers
[2:22:34] sorcerers
[2:22:36] we think about
[2:22:38] probably somewhere in this County I'm
[2:22:40] quite sure that there are
[2:22:42] witch covens
[2:22:45] meetings of witches
[2:22:47] and I am sure
[2:22:50] that we are on their radar
[2:22:54] but I do not have to fear
[2:22:56] because the Lord fights for me
[2:22:59] that doesn't mean I'm unaware that
[2:23:01] doesn't mean that I run scared that
[2:23:03] doesn't mean that I rise up and try to
[2:23:06] take uh to try with my ability to pull
[2:23:10] down every stronghold of Witchcraft that
[2:23:12] is in this County it is that I build up
[2:23:15] myself in my Most Holy Faith letting the
[2:23:18] blood of Jesus Christ be a bulwark
[2:23:20] against that now there are times where
[2:23:23] the holy spirit gives an assignment and
[2:23:26] he says you pray against that you you
[2:23:28] put a special bulwark of of the uh or
[2:23:31] safety net however you want to say it
[2:23:33] against that that it can't get to God's
[2:23:36] people
[2:23:38] there are sorcerers
[2:23:41] but there are those
[2:23:44] who
[2:23:46] do not attend
[2:23:48] which coven meetings
[2:23:51] but there are those who try to
[2:23:54] manipulate our service
[2:23:57] with their prayers
[2:24:03] and these are the ones that we
[2:24:06] are going to be a little bit more aware
[2:24:08] of
[2:24:09] that we have to deal with
[2:24:13] they're closer in
[2:24:19] but he said the Lord said I'm going to
[2:24:22] be a swift witness against the sorcerers
[2:24:25] remember Malachi 3 we said is an ongoing
[2:24:28] prophecy
[2:24:30] and we're allowing him to fulfill all of
[2:24:34] it as he will in our time
[2:24:39] so he says I'm going to come near to you
[2:24:41] to judgment and I'm going to be Swift
[2:24:44] with witness against the sorcerers so
[2:24:47] those that try to pray in a certain way
[2:24:50] to manipulate your life or manipulate
[2:24:54] the service here or manipulate the way
[2:24:57] that God would handle a situation
[2:25:00] there's a swift witness of the Holy
[2:25:02] Ghost that's coming right now to deal
[2:25:06] with these situations because there are
[2:25:09] people among us
[2:25:12] that have been given Authority in prayer
[2:25:15] as intercessors to take authority to
[2:25:19] plant a bulwark against these things
[2:25:21] still that they fall null and void
[2:25:24] powerless to the ground
[2:25:27] all right
[2:25:29] so as you pray
[2:25:33] I would advise you if your children are
[2:25:35] away from the Lord
[2:25:36] I would advise you not to pray God do
[2:25:40] what you have to
[2:25:41] you know put them in a car wreck or
[2:25:43] train record no no
[2:25:47] God who is rich in Mercy knows the right
[2:25:50] time the right way to get their
[2:25:54] attention
[2:25:55] perhaps it will be through tragedy that
[2:25:58] he gets their attention I don't know
[2:26:00] but you don't have to put any of that on
[2:26:02] them
[2:26:04] you can pray God your kingdom come and
[2:26:08] your will be done in earth as it is in
[2:26:11] heaven
[2:26:12] now see we can pray your kingdom come
[2:26:15] your will be done as it is in heaven so
[2:26:18] let it be done on the Earth
[2:26:21] but we can also pray let it be done in
[2:26:23] this earth
[2:26:27] man
[2:26:29] because that's what we're desirous of
[2:26:32] is that we are vessels that God can work
[2:26:36] through and this dirt this pile of Ashes
[2:26:40] this that's going back to the ashes
[2:26:44] is being used by God right now that we
[2:26:48] can pull Heaven's plans into the Earth
[2:26:50] I'm not trying to manipulate Heaven's
[2:26:53] plans I'm not trying to alter Heaven's
[2:26:55] plans I'm trying by God's grace to pull
[2:26:58] Heaven's plans into the Earth so that we
[2:27:00] can know what is the mind of God at this
[2:27:03] moment
[2:27:05] what is the mind of God for this season
[2:27:08] of My Life
[2:27:12] so
[2:27:14] we want to allow him to be swift witness
[2:27:17] against sorcerers
[2:27:20] then he said he would be swift witness
[2:27:22] against adulterers
[2:27:30] adultery comes in many forms
[2:27:35] and we know through the Old Testament
[2:27:38] God
[2:27:41] was against adultery
[2:27:45] and then in the New Testament there is a
[2:27:49] clarification between fornication and
[2:27:53] adultery
[2:27:54] fornication is relationship between man
[2:27:59] and a woman that is that they're not
[2:28:00] married
[2:28:01] and
[2:28:03] the Bible tells us that it is the
[2:28:05] necessity of a woman that if she has
[2:28:09] been found this way before being married
[2:28:11] that it is of necessity for her to tell
[2:28:14] her husband uh to be that this all needs
[2:28:18] to be taken care of before marriage
[2:28:20] so that afterward
[2:28:22] if she kept it a secret
[2:28:25] then Jesus said except for the cause of
[2:28:28] fornication
[2:28:31] she could not be put away
[2:28:34] so after the marriage
[2:28:36] if all of this has been laid out a
[2:28:38] fourth time
[2:28:40] the man has no excuse afterwards
[2:28:47] God takes adultery very seriously
[2:28:51] we know that there are a lot of
[2:28:53] scrambled eggs
[2:28:55] you can't unscramble scrambled eggs
[2:28:58] but I give you the words of a Vindicated
[2:29:00] prophet
[2:29:02] stay as you are and God have mercy on
[2:29:06] you if you ever do it again
[2:29:11] I'm right there right there that's what
[2:29:13] he said
[2:29:14] and I received that
[2:29:18] God has called us to a higher level
[2:29:21] so then we also have this aspect of
[2:29:25] adultery when it comes to the word of
[2:29:27] God where men are trying to bring in
[2:29:31] other women
[2:29:36] churches
[2:29:38] religious systems
[2:29:41] refer you back I believe it was last
[2:29:43] Sunday about the the mother of
[2:29:44] harlots the Roman system the mark of the
[2:29:48] beast all of this stuff is part of that
[2:29:51] Beast system and we find gospel
[2:29:54] preachers over the years as time has
[2:29:56] gone by there has been an indentation of
[2:30:00] an adultery in the preaching
[2:30:04] there has been uh where that they have
[2:30:08] been grappling they have been receiving
[2:30:11] the seed of other women they have been
[2:30:14] receiving the thoughts of other women
[2:30:16] they have been laying down with other
[2:30:19] women and they have brought these
[2:30:22] thought processes into the gospel
[2:30:24] preaching
[2:30:26] and it has caused a mixed seed
[2:30:29] a hybrid
[2:30:31] a hybrid
[2:30:34] and a hybrid
[2:30:36] cannot reproduce itself
[2:30:41] it may look
[2:30:42] almost like the Original Seed but a
[2:30:46] hybrid cannot reproduce itself
[2:30:49] now these adulterous Affairs that men
[2:30:52] have had through the years it has caused
[2:30:55] a bunch of scrambled eggs
[2:30:57] I'm talking religious now in the
[2:31:00] religious Realm
[2:31:01] because men have come with their ideas
[2:31:05] do you realize that there are there are
[2:31:09] National secrets
[2:31:11] that are given away
[2:31:15] to prostitutes
[2:31:18] because men
[2:31:21] have these adulterous Affairs and they
[2:31:25] give away these secrets of National
[2:31:28] Security and they don't even realize
[2:31:31] that they're doing it and Men preachers
[2:31:34] have done the same thing in the
[2:31:37] spiritual realm they have given away
[2:31:39] secrets and they have received stuff
[2:31:41] into their own bosom that they've tried
[2:31:44] to feed to the people and it has caused
[2:31:47] churches to become uh
[2:31:51] come on hybrid
[2:31:55] and that is why that we keep coming back
[2:32:00] we cannot we cannot partake of this
[2:32:03] paganism because it's part of the Roman
[2:32:06] system and we don't want anything to
[2:32:09] mess with them if you genuine seed of
[2:32:11] God
[2:32:14] because we want only the pure seed
[2:32:18] the genuine
[2:32:19] and so we can't allow mixture to come in
[2:32:23] Among Us
[2:32:25] all right then we have false swearers
[2:32:30] someone who willfully and knowingly
[2:32:34] makes a false statement
[2:32:37] about a material fact
[2:32:42] friends we live in an hour where
[2:32:43] Integrity matters
[2:32:45] it has always mattered but if that
[2:32:47] Integrity ever mattered to us as the
[2:32:50] Bride of Jesus Christ it matters now
[2:32:52] what we say matters
[2:32:55] what we talk about matters
[2:32:58] what we repeat matters
[2:33:01] what we say over again matters
[2:33:05] what we embellish matters
[2:33:08] we've got to speak truth we've got to be
[2:33:12] men and women of Integrity even to our
[2:33:15] own hurt we cannot be false swearers
[2:33:22] I realize that I'm not going to finish
[2:33:24] this today so the musicians can come
[2:33:26] while I finish these last four
[2:33:29] those who oppress
[2:33:31] the wages of the hireling
[2:33:34] now we don't have to deal too much with
[2:33:36] this
[2:33:38] um
[2:33:39] because we we
[2:33:41] most of us when we go get a job we
[2:33:45] ask what our salary is going to be
[2:33:47] before we ever start you know what's
[2:33:49] what's my hourly rate or what's my
[2:33:50] salary how often am I going to be paid
[2:33:52] but in those days and days of old where
[2:33:55] there was day laborers and they were
[2:33:57] depending on that money to be able to
[2:33:59] eat that evening to be able to go to the
[2:34:01] market that evening it was very
[2:34:04] important for them to keep their word
[2:34:07] about what they said that they would be
[2:34:10] honoring their word about the payment to
[2:34:13] that person that worked for them that
[2:34:16] they would honor that and that they
[2:34:17] would not oppress and at the end of the
[2:34:19] day come and say
[2:34:21] I'm sorry I don't have it
[2:34:25] I'm sorry you weren't worth what you
[2:34:27] what we agreed upon
[2:34:32] now this really again can go to the
[2:34:36] giving of our word
[2:34:38] not just a wage as in dollars and cents
[2:34:41] but the giving of our word honor your
[2:34:44] word
[2:34:46] honor your word if you say you're going
[2:34:49] to do something
[2:34:50] do it
[2:34:53] and if you can't
[2:34:57] say you can't
[2:35:03] as I get older I realize that I can't
[2:35:05] fulfill everything that everybody wants
[2:35:07] out of me
[2:35:09] you can't either
[2:35:10] it's not wrong for us to say no but to
[2:35:14] say we're going to do something for
[2:35:15] somebody and then we don't do it
[2:35:17] we're not keeping our word we say we're
[2:35:20] going to give something to somebody we
[2:35:21] don't do we're not keeping our word it
[2:35:23] is important for us to keep our word
[2:35:28] Swift witness against those who oppress
[2:35:32] the fatherless
[2:35:36] I find through the scripture
[2:35:40] that
[2:35:42] starting in the Old Testament all the
[2:35:44] way to the end of the New Testament God
[2:35:47] cared about these three the fatherless
[2:35:49] the Widow and The Stranger
[2:35:53] he had great care for them
[2:35:56] because he realized that there was no
[2:35:58] one to take care of them
[2:36:01] and he wanted somebody to be mindful
[2:36:05] enough to care for them
[2:36:08] and so he repeated it Time After Time
[2:36:11] After Time
[2:36:13] and if we as individuals are
[2:36:17] hard-hearted
[2:36:18] and we see someone who is fatherless or
[2:36:21] someone who is a widow or someone who is
[2:36:24] a stranger now
[2:36:26] let me just clarify about strangers
[2:36:32] I'm not trying to tell you mothers that
[2:36:34] your children need to speak to every
[2:36:36] stranger
[2:36:37] not no
[2:36:40] some of your children don't need any
[2:36:42] help they talk to everybody
[2:36:46] I think it's precious
[2:36:49] until they start walking off with a
[2:36:51] stranger
[2:36:53] and there are many panhandlers
[2:36:58] on the street corner
[2:37:01] and I don't think that God called me to
[2:37:04] provide for every one of them
[2:37:07] I can't
[2:37:08] it's impossible
[2:37:12] and
[2:37:13] I have been burnt enough times
[2:37:17] until that I struggle with helping any
[2:37:21] of them
[2:37:28] so now
[2:37:30] I have a choice
[2:37:33] will I Harden My Heart against all of
[2:37:36] them
[2:37:37] and Say Never Again
[2:37:40] or will I allow the refiners fire
[2:37:45] will I allow the Fuller soap
[2:37:50] to continue getting things out of me
[2:37:52] till I can have clearer eyes
[2:37:56] clearer vision
[2:38:00] more
[2:38:02] genuine understanding and and uh
[2:38:07] a clearer ear to hear that gentle still
[2:38:12] small voice
[2:38:13] say this one
[2:38:18] this one
[2:38:21] put aside your thinking
[2:38:23] put aside your bias
[2:38:26] put aside anything that would be in your
[2:38:29] mind
[2:38:31] against panhandlers
[2:38:35] this one
[2:38:39] The Importance of Being LED
[2:38:42] by the Holy Ghost
[2:38:45] so that we can help the Widow
[2:38:48] especially those that are of the
[2:38:51] household of faith
[2:38:53] we've got widows here
[2:38:55] that need help
[2:38:58] some of them don't need
[2:38:59] the financial help
[2:39:02] God has provided that but some of them
[2:39:04] in their Elder age have got weak and
[2:39:06] they just need somebody to come and put
[2:39:08] something heavy on a top shelf out of
[2:39:10] the way
[2:39:14] the fatherless
[2:39:17] we have children in this assembly
[2:39:23] that do not have a natural father
[2:39:28] but we men
[2:39:31] can reach to them
[2:39:34] and be kind
[2:39:36] show compassion
[2:39:38] step in where Mama might not be able to
[2:39:40] fulfill give a word of instruction that
[2:39:45] may be coming from a man would be
[2:39:47] different than coming from a mother and
[2:39:49] and at that appropriate time by the
[2:39:51] leadership of the Holy Ghost that word
[2:39:54] of instruction coming out of the mouth
[2:39:56] of a man a word in due season that would
[2:39:58] not only help that child but help that
[2:40:01] mother
[2:40:03] because God is coming with swift
[2:40:05] judgment against those who oppress
[2:40:09] the Widow
[2:40:10] the fatherless the stranger from his
[2:40:14] right
[2:40:15] and then
[2:40:17] those that don't fear the lord
[2:40:22] he desires for us
[2:40:24] to have a reverential awe of him
[2:40:31] I don't have to be afraid of him
[2:40:34] how many times in the New Testament did
[2:40:36] he say fear not
[2:40:37] fear not don't be afraid he doesn't want
[2:40:41] us to be afraid of him but he doesn't
[2:40:42] want us to be haughty
[2:40:44] he doesn't want us when he comes in here
[2:40:47] to try to ourself up against him
[2:40:50] and say no not this time
[2:40:59] to allow the reverential all
[2:41:02] of the spirit of God to come in this
[2:41:04] place
[2:41:06] and to move Among Us in such a way
[2:41:09] now this ongoing prophecy is going to be
[2:41:12] an on ongoing teaching because there's
[2:41:14] no way I can finish today
[2:41:16] so I want you to stand with me and we'll
[2:41:19] take what we have heard thus far and
[2:41:21] we'll let the Holy Spirit just begin to
[2:41:24] work among us to do in US Ben you're
[2:41:27] getting a song we we're just going to
[2:41:29] allow the Holy Spirit to work in us and
[2:41:32] take what we've heard today there's
[2:41:34] plenty to chew on there's plenty for us
[2:41:37] to say Lord
[2:41:39] I know that you have let me be in a heat
[2:41:43] of battle you've put me in a place of
[2:41:46] the Refiner's Fire and it sure doesn't
[2:41:49] feel good
[2:41:51] but I realize as I've said under the
[2:41:54] sound of the word today that it is
[2:41:56] necessary for my growth it is necessary
[2:42:00] for my uh my ongoing instruction in the
[2:42:04] word of God that I get this piece of
[2:42:07] dross out of the way this that is coming
[2:42:10] up in my heart in my mind in my thought
[2:42:12] processes even now it is something that
[2:42:15] I realize that you're dealing with right
[2:42:18] now and you've brought me into this
[2:42:20] fiery place because this is what you
[2:42:22] want to deal with right now because you
[2:42:25] have a desire
[2:42:27] to bring fullness
[2:42:30] completeness wholeness
[2:42:33] into my life
[2:42:35] now Lord as we worship together I ask
[2:42:38] you
[2:42:39] to work among your people to accomplish
[2:42:43] what you desire to today in the name of
[2:42:47] Jesus Christ you seal this word in and
[2:42:50] do Great and Mighty things in our midst

[2:43:38] been forsaken I've never had to stand
[2:43:43] one test alone
[2:43:46] but when I look at all the victories and
[2:43:51] the spirit Rises up in me and it's
[2:43:55] through the fire my weaknesses make
[2:43:59] strong
[2:44:06] and he never promised that the cross
[2:44:10] would not get heavy and the hill would
[2:44:14] not be hard to
[2:44:17] collide
[2:44:19] and he never offered our victories
[2:44:24] without fighting but he said hell would
[2:44:28] always come in time
[2:44:32] and just remember when you're standing
[2:44:36] in the valley of decision and the

[3:05:20] those of you that are still here would
[3:05:21] you just raise your hands this way
[3:05:26] charity and Joshua are going out on
[3:05:28] adventure starting this week
[3:05:31] to own their own business
[3:05:35] and we want to ask the Lord
[3:05:38] it's a promise for the men of this
[3:05:39] church
[3:05:40] we claim that promise
[3:05:43] we speak that promise over their lives
[3:05:47] that they will be blessed going out
[3:05:49] coming in
[3:05:51] and they're sitting down and when
[3:05:53] they're standing up that they will be
[3:05:54] blessed
[3:05:56] that all the anxieties that come with
[3:05:58] starting a business would just roll off
[3:06:00] of them in the name of Jesus Christ Lord
[3:06:03] as we lay our hands upon them Lord
[3:06:07] Joshua is the one that is going to be
[3:06:11] doing the majority of the work but God
[3:06:13] as uh uh being married to a wife Lord
[3:06:18] this is a joint venture and there is
[3:06:22] anxieties with it and so we ask you Lord
[3:06:26] that you would relieve both of them of
[3:06:29] this anxiety God that there would come
[3:06:31] such a wave of assurance from the hand
[3:06:35] of the Living God that they know that
[3:06:37] this is the moment this is the hour this
[3:06:40] is the right time this is the business
[3:06:42] this is what you have ordained for them
[3:06:45] and so God I pray that it says they step
[3:06:49] out on a word from the Lord that was
[3:06:52] given many years ago that it's an
[3:06:54] ongoing prophecy even as we mentioned
[3:06:57] this morning God this ongoing prophecy
[3:07:00] we bring it forward to February of 2023
[3:07:04] for Joshua and charity Yantis to believe
[3:07:08] that this business would Prosper that it
[3:07:11] would be a a business of integrity and
[3:07:15] that God you would let there be such
[3:07:17] favor upon it that people will stand
[3:07:20] back and say wow What the Lord Has Done
[3:07:24] on their behalf
[3:07:26] now God I pray that you will send the
[3:07:29] work according to your will that there
[3:07:32] would not be any Unholy alliances made
[3:07:34] give such Direction by the holy ghost
[3:07:37] that there would be no Unholy Alliance
[3:07:40] that God you would direct Joshua and
[3:07:43] charity in everything that they do every
[3:07:46] Venture that they make Lord decisions
[3:07:49] concerning Finance whatever that would
[3:07:51] be I pray God that you would just work
[3:07:54] upon them and in them and that your
[3:07:57] blessing would rest on them in the name
[3:08:00] of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray this
[3:08:03] amen
[3:08:05] amen
[3:08:07] praise the Lord
[3:08:09] Hallelujah
[3:08:13] now you got me
[3:08:15] praise
