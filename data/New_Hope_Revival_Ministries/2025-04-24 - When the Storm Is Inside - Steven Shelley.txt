TRANSCRIPT
========================================
To be possessed demonically is to be occupied from the inside. But to be oppressed is to be pushed down, squeezed, limited from the outside. This is the the plight of the children of God in the last days. We are pressed in. We are oppressed. There is a heaviness that wants to take over in our life, in our emotions, in our dealings with others. But I want you to know we don't have to accept that we have been called above the spirit of the age. As we said, we've been given the anointing of a flying eagle. Not a molting eagle, not a valley dwelling eagle, but one who has taken his position, his election. He knows who he is. And the fourth living creature is that flying eagle. I I notice that uh when John was describing these four living creatures, he didn't say one was a walking man and one was a bellowing ox or a beast. But when it came to the eagle, he gave some vision, some visual, some action. And he said he's as of a flying eagle, meaning one that is actively soaring above. I am persuaded today more than ever before that God has made a provision. He has made a way to get you and I above above hello above all. Above every hardship, above every hindrance, above every oppression, above every lie, above every infirmity, every symptom, every political pressure, every lifethreatening situation, I'm persuaded God has made a way. Over and over and over and over again, he keeps making a way. He makes the storm a calm. He recreates what is tumultuous, what is raging, what is wild. And just with his touch, with his word, with his intervention, it becomes something entirely different. How can he do that? Because he's the creator. You see, the reality is Jesus doesn't sweat the small stuff. He doesn't get excited over waves when the storm is at its worst. He's as calm as he can be. He was still on board. He's still on the throne. He rebuked the storm, spoke peace to them. The Did you really realize that the storm he was talking to wasn't just the natural expression, it was the storm within them. Master, master, we perish. Don't you care? We thought you loved us. That's the storm that needs to be spoken to today. There's somebody that's going to realize before you go to bed tonight that a storm has risen on your lake [Music] and your master seems to be asleep because he could be doing something about it, but he doesn't seem to be doing something about it. Somebody said, "I was praying. Were you praying or were you begging?" Were you approaching him as an orphan or a son? I hear religious prayers sometime that sound more to me like an orphan desperately looking for a daddy warbucks, a little Annie somewhere that needs a savior, not a bride that has already found what she was looking for. And and the reality is you didn't find him. He found you. You were the one lost and he came looking for you. He found you in your sin. He found you in your bondage. He found you in your addiction. You think he's going to leave you now? You think he's going to forsake you now? Hello. Never. Never. Sometimes we feel trapped on a boat in the middle of a storm tossed sea. The waves of life are knocking us to and fro. You peer into the darkness hoping to see an end of the storm. But all you see is more gray skies and more gray skies and more angry waves. And it seems like every day a new element of chaos is added to the storm. But if you recognize that Jesus is in your boat, the master of the universe is in your vessel. He can be asleep and you are still safe. Yes, sir. That's good. I'm convinced that they could have pulled up a pillow. Yeah. And made it safely to the other side. You mean nobody praying, nobody rebuking, nobody taking author? Absolutely. I believe those disciples could have, but if they had have, you wouldn't have recognized ourselves in the story.
