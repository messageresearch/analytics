[0:00] [Music]
[0:20] you
[0:21] [Music]
[0:37] you
[0:38] [Music]
[0:50] hello I'm Pastor Steven Shelly and
[0:53] you're watching the Eagles cry I want to
[0:56] welcome you to the program today we are
[0:58] in the middle of a series where we are
[1:02] studying the scriptures and looking at
[1:05] them together the scriptures concerning
[1:08] spiritual adoption and we sometimes
[1:11] refer to it as the process of spiritual
[1:15] adoption maybe you're more familiar with
[1:17] the pronunciation of the word process
[1:20] but we're looking at the fact that there
[1:23] is a beginning point and there is a
[1:25] growth a process whereby we come into a
[1:29] deeper place of maturity in the Lord
[1:32] Jesus Christ we see that in the life of
[1:36] the Lord Jesus Yeshua the Messiah and
[1:39] we're going to look at that today on the
[1:42] last program we were reading all of the
[1:45] Gospel accounts concerning the baptism
[1:49] and on the Mount of Transfiguration so
[1:52] we'll do a recap in just a moment and
[1:54] then we'll continue the teaching I hope
[1:56] you're not boring with the subject
[1:58] because this is one of the most
[2:00] important subjects that I believe God is
[2:03] speaking to his people about in this
[2:05] hour and there is something about it
[2:08] that stirs me so much I get so excited
[2:11] when I talk about this process of
[2:14] spiritual adoption and coming into that
[2:17] place of maturity in Jesus Christ we're
[2:21] tired of being children we're tired of
[2:23] being tossed to and fro with every wind
[2:25] that blows by we want to be mature and
[2:28] we want to be people that are not driven
[2:31] by our emotions but people who are
[2:34] anchored in the Word of God and we meet
[2:38] the resistance of the enemy not
[2:40] emotionally but we meet the resistance
[2:43] of the enemy a standing firm on the
[2:46] revelation that he has given us from his
[2:48] word so that's what this study is about
[2:50] I want to thank you for those of you who
[2:54] have emailed us or sent even a letter or
[2:57] a phone call to let us know that the
[3:00] Eagles cry is a blessing
[3:01] to you it's a wonderful blessing when we
[3:05] hear from you it thrills us in fact and
[3:08] still to this day I go home and tell my
[3:11] children that we have heard from India
[3:15] from Pakistan from united arab emirates
[3:19] and all over Europe and Scandinavia and
[3:22] the UK and and the list goes on and on
[3:24] and it's just such a privilege to be
[3:26] able to come to you and that's why I
[3:29] appreciate so much the sacrifice that's
[3:32] being made on on the Christian networks
[3:35] that bring you the Eagles cry so when
[3:37] you pray pray for them that God will
[3:40] bless them and use them and increase
[3:42] them as they continue to labor
[3:45] tirelessly to get the gospel around the
[3:48] world I want us to look right into the
[3:51] scriptures today and continue our study
[3:54] okay when we were together last time we
[3:57] read from Matthew Mark and Luke that
[4:01] would be Matthew chapter three mark
[4:03] chapter one and Luke chapter three
[4:06] concerning the baptism of the Lord Jesus
[4:09] now I don't want to take your time to to
[4:13] go back and read all of the verses but I
[4:15] want to recap by saying that in Matthew
[4:18] when the Lord is being brought up out of
[4:22] the water the Spirit of God descended
[4:24] like a dove and a voice spoken said this
[4:27] is my beloved Son in whom I am well
[4:30] pleased in mark he records that the
[4:34] voice said thou art my beloved Son in
[4:37] whom I am well pleased slightly
[4:39] different wording but certainly the same
[4:42] message and then in Luke it is recorded
[4:44] thou art my beloved Son in thee I am
[4:48] well pleased so the addition of one word
[4:51] v I think it's clear for us to
[4:54] understand that there is a tremendous
[4:56] continuity and harmony between all three
[5:01] of the Gospel writers concerning the
[5:03] voice and what the voice said I believe
[5:06] that perhaps a more accurate translation
[5:09] of these words would be thou art my
[5:13] beloved son or
[5:14] you are my beloved Son in whom I am
[5:17] pleased to dwell you do understand that
[5:21] it was the eternal spirit of the father
[5:23] that was embodied incarnate in the Lord
[5:28] Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah so what
[5:32] was this announcement about it seeing
[5:34] that it was an announcement of
[5:36] relationship where the Spirit of God the
[5:39] Eternal Spirit of the father was
[5:41] testifying to those that day on the
[5:44] banks of the Jordan River this is my son
[5:48] this is the promised messiah and i am
[5:51] pleased to dwell in him later we find
[5:55] Jesus saying in the Gospels that when
[5:58] you've seen me you've seen the father we
[6:00] also hear him saying that he can do
[6:04] nothing unless it is revealed to him by
[6:07] his father so we know that there was an
[6:10] almost almost incomprehensible unity
[6:15] it's very difficult it's only by the
[6:17] revelation of the Holy Spirit that we
[6:19] can understand the the unique the unique
[6:23] characteristics of Yeshua the Messiah he
[6:26] was both God and man the eternal spirit
[6:30] of the father lived inside of him and
[6:32] yet he had a fleshly body that got
[6:36] hungry that got tired that got upset and
[6:39] angry in fact the scripture said he was
[6:42] in all manner tempted as we are that
[6:46] that's that brings hope to me to know
[6:49] and yet the scripture says without sin
[6:54] jesus said I have overcome the world he
[6:56] said little children I write unto you
[6:58] that you should overcome the world and
[7:00] he said you can because I have that's
[7:03] even more hope so we have a tremendous
[7:06] amount of hope in the Lord Jesus Christ
[7:09] in that he was able to please the father
[7:12] though he was living in a fleshly body
[7:14] now in Matthew Mark and Luke we have the
[7:22] account of what happened on the Mount of
[7:26] Transfiguration we mentioned the
[7:28] last time we were together that that
[7:30] historically some believe that it
[7:33] happened on Mount Tabor and some believe
[7:35] that it happened on Mount her moan I'm
[7:38] not one hundred percent clear but I
[7:40] believe that because mount hormone is in
[7:43] the general area of Caesarea Philippi
[7:46] and that is where Yeshua was with his
[7:50] disciples just prior to what happened on
[7:52] the Mount of Transfiguration that it's
[7:54] more likely that this high mountain was
[7:57] in fact mount her moon there are other
[8:00] other reasons why one would come to that
[8:03] conclusion as well that perhaps we can
[8:06] talk about at another time some
[8:09] indication of that could perhaps be in
[8:11] studying the events that took place in
[8:14] Genesis chapter 6 but we'll have to save
[8:17] that of course for another study in
[8:20] Matthew chapter 17 now I'm not going to
[8:23] read the whole account again we did that
[8:25] but we read that there was a bright
[8:27] cloud that overshadowed them remember
[8:30] Moses and Elijah appeared with the Lord
[8:33] Jesus Yeshua talking to him and he had
[8:36] taken with him his inner circle of
[8:39] trusted friends the disciples a Peter
[8:43] James and John and so the cloud came and
[8:46] overshadowed them and there was a voice
[8:49] that spoke out of the cloud much like
[8:52] happened in the Jordan River during the
[8:55] time of the baptism and this time
[8:57] Matthew said the voice said this is my
[9:00] beloved Son in whom I am well pleased
[9:02] almost identical but with the addition
[9:06] of three words hear ye him it appears
[9:10] that the announcement was taken to a
[9:12] deeper level mark said this is my
[9:15] beloved son hear him and that was mark
[9:19] chapter 9 and in Luke chapter 9 we have
[9:22] the voice saying from the cloud this is
[9:25] my beloved son hear him it appears that
[9:29] the father was announcing to Peter James
[9:31] and John that it was now time that that
[9:35] our Lord Jesus had come to the fullness
[9:39] of hizmet
[9:40] dirty and that he would now be launched
[9:44] with a very important message that would
[9:48] transform lives somebody said wait a
[9:51] minute that sounds quite strange that
[9:52] Jesus had a process of adoption to go
[9:56] through but remember the scriptures that
[9:58] we've looked at more than once here on
[10:00] the Eagles cry in Hebrews chapter 5
[10:03] verses 8 through 10 I particularly love
[10:06] these verses though he were a son now
[10:10] for me that is not debatable that is a
[10:13] fact Jesus Christ Yeshua HaMashiach was
[10:17] the son of the Living God for me that's
[10:20] a revelation though he were a son yet
[10:24] learned he obedience now perhaps you
[10:27] think well because he was the son of God
[10:30] he had need to learn nothing but that is
[10:33] not in fact what the scripture teaches
[10:35] yet learned he obedience how how did he
[10:40] learn total obedience and surrender to
[10:44] the will of his father the scripture
[10:45] said by the things which he suffered his
[10:50] suffering caused him to be able to come
[10:54] to that place of total surrender and
[10:58] oneness and submission and obedience to
[11:02] his Heavenly Father I believe as I have
[11:05] indicated on this program before that
[11:07] God is about to bring forth a company of
[11:10] believers who will operate in the same
[11:13] kind of oneness that Jesus had with the
[11:18] father that you and I will come to a
[11:20] place of spiritual maturity that we will
[11:24] operate and demonstrate our oneness
[11:28] Union and relationship with God when
[11:32] that comes to its fullness or into its a
[11:36] stage of maturity the world is going to
[11:40] see a demonstration of the power of God
[11:43] that is unprecedented in human history
[11:46] because it's not going to be one Jesus
[11:49] it's not going to be a handful of a
[11:52] posse
[11:53] it's not going to be a couple three four
[11:56] thousand people as it was in the early
[11:58] church or a few tokens here and there as
[12:01] it was in the great healing revival of
[12:04] the 50s and 60s but a whole company of
[12:08] believers that are individually yet
[12:11] simultaneously being prepared and
[12:14] equipped all over the world right now
[12:17] and how is that happening I mean how do
[12:20] people know that they're being prepared
[12:22] and equipped for this place of sonship
[12:25] they know it because the deep of God in
[12:29] their spirit is calling out to the deep
[12:32] I remember a story one time that we were
[12:36] told about a child I've mentioned it
[12:38] here on the program before but it seems
[12:41] to fit where we're speaking about right
[12:43] now there was a child many years ago who
[12:45] began to demonstrate unusual behavior by
[12:50] eating the erasers off of the pencils in
[12:54] school and then they found the same
[12:57] child literally eating the pedals the
[12:59] rubber petals of the bicycle and they
[13:03] took the child to the doctor because
[13:05] they thought this is the most unusual
[13:07] behavior we've ever seen something must
[13:10] be terribly wrong and they take the
[13:12] child to the physician and the physician
[13:14] examines the child and does tests and
[13:17] finds out that the only thing wrong with
[13:20] this child is that the child has a
[13:23] deficiency of of something like sulfur
[13:28] and without any knowledge without anyone
[13:34] telling the child that there is sulfur
[13:37] in rubber something caused the child may
[13:41] be putting a pencil in his mouth one day
[13:44] and you know just chewing on it or
[13:47] sucking on it like children have a
[13:48] tendency to do somehow the sulfur that
[13:52] was in the rubber of that eraser met a
[13:54] need in that child's body that kept that
[13:58] child going back time and time again to
[14:01] chew the erasers off and to eat the
[14:03] pedals off of the bicycle when I hear
[14:06] that stole
[14:07] it's it's like there was a deep need a
[14:11] deficiency something lacking in that
[14:14] child's body in the systems of that
[14:17] child's body that they weren't getting
[14:20] the child wasn't getting the need met by
[14:23] the food that he was eating or his
[14:26] regular vitamins or whatever the child
[14:28] might have been taking the only thing
[14:30] that satisfied the need he found it
[14:33] almost accidentally but quite profoundly
[14:36] in the eraser or the rubber pedal on a
[14:40] bicycle I believe that right now all
[14:43] over the world there is a deep need that
[14:47] is gnawing and pulling in the spirit man
[14:51] of those that God is choosing to be
[14:55] overcomers in the last day what we call
[14:59] a part of the Bride of Christ and
[15:01] there's a yearning and a burning and a
[15:04] longing for more of God and you perhaps
[15:07] don't even know why do I feel this way
[15:10] am i weird am i strange do I need the
[15:13] doctor is there something wrong with me
[15:15] because you've just got this longing and
[15:17] burning and I believe what it is it's
[15:20] the deep of God that's calling out it's
[15:23] a deep within you a deep desire a deep
[15:25] need calling out and and the deep is
[15:28] calling to the deep and if the deep is
[15:31] calling to the deep there must be
[15:33] somewhere something that will respond
[15:36] that will satisfy that need now a lot of
[15:39] times people are looking for things of
[15:42] this world and alternative religions and
[15:45] and and so forth to fulfill that need
[15:48] but that will never satisfy the true
[15:51] longing of the sons of God for union
[15:55] with God it is something that's
[15:58] happening and I traveled all over the
[16:01] world I've been in over 60 nations and
[16:04] everywhere I've been I meet people that
[16:07] have this unexplainable almost longing
[16:11] and desire for more of God Church is
[16:15] good being together with God's people is
[16:17] good reading good books about what God
[16:20] has done is good but none of that
[16:23] satisfies enough so you keep coming back
[16:26] to God and coming back to God and coming
[16:29] back to God and I believe there's an
[16:30] important lesson that we're learning in
[16:33] this hour so I just encourage you to
[16:36] search the Scriptures diligently to
[16:38] confirm that these things be so to pray
[16:42] and pour out your heart before the Lord
[16:44] confess your need to God and know that
[16:47] he is faithful and just to forgive us of
[16:51] our sins to meet us at the point of our
[16:54] need there's nothing that you have need
[16:57] of in God that that he doesn't have in
[17:01] his bountiful resource supply if you'll
[17:04] just trust him and apply the word of God
[17:08] to your life you know it's the enemy's
[17:10] job to try to disconnect you from the
[17:14] Word of God to disqualify you to cause
[17:18] you to feel like well that's good for
[17:20] for goody-goodies but i'm not a
[17:21] goody-goody now that's good for this
[17:23] group of people or for those who were
[17:26] raised in the church sometimes people
[17:28] say churches all right for women and
[17:30] children you know you'll sometimes hear
[17:32] macho men say churches all right for old
[17:35] ladies and children well I want to tell
[17:37] you something it's not just old ladies
[17:39] and children that need a Savior every
[17:42] person under the sound of my voice needs
[17:45] a savior you need the Lord and many of
[17:49] you have found him but you have also
[17:51] found yourself walking in a place of
[17:54] lethargy a place of you know spiritual
[17:59] laziness and God wants to stir that up
[18:02] and that's part of the reason why we're
[18:04] bringing the kind of teachings that we
[18:07] bring on the Eagles cry it just it's
[18:09] just sort of the vein or the flow that
[18:13] God has called us to it's sort of the
[18:15] mandate that we have and we're just
[18:17] putting nuggets we're just trying to put
[18:19] little deposits of something before you
[18:21] that perhaps will stir something up it
[18:25] will touch that part of your destiny and
[18:27] will cause you to to maybe give God a
[18:31] little more attention
[18:33] and spend a little more time just being
[18:36] quiet before the Lord and as I've taught
[18:38] you many times on this program the the
[18:42] number one way to approach God I think
[18:46] and you know you might theological II
[18:49] disagree but I think even more than
[18:51] prayer I think praise and worship is one
[18:55] of the greatest avenues that we have as
[18:58] believers to touch the heart of God when
[19:00] we just start loving on the Lord Lord I
[19:03] love you I thank you for what you've
[19:06] done in my life and I thank you for who
[19:08] you are I have friends that spend an
[19:12] enormous amount of time reading the
[19:15] Psalms to God reading them out loud as a
[19:18] form of worship and praise developing a
[19:23] biblical praise and worship vocabulary
[19:26] that touches the heart of God and it and
[19:29] it makes a connection it deepens and
[19:32] strengthens the spiritual connection
[19:34] that we have with the Lord and causes us
[19:37] to to grow to grow in grace to grow in
[19:41] truth to grow in supernatural knowledge
[19:44] and wisdom and the things that have been
[19:46] promised to us as part of our
[19:49] relationship with the Lord so though he
[19:52] were a son yet learn to obedience by the
[19:55] things which he suffered and being made
[19:59] perfect he became the author of eternal
[20:02] salvation unto all them that obey Him
[20:05] called of God a high priest after the
[20:08] order of Melchizedek now quickly let's
[20:11] look at the word sons because we get
[20:14] this as many times in the scripture sons
[20:18] and there are actually three different
[20:21] Greek words that can be translated as
[20:26] sons or children in the Bible and what I
[20:30] have found by looking at those three
[20:32] words is that they reveal a pattern of
[20:36] sort of like three stages or three steps
[20:40] toward maturity in the life of a
[20:44] believer and that sort of typed out
[20:46] in the natural development of a child of
[20:50] a person of a human being now we look at
[20:53] the three words and the first word is
[20:56] technion and it means infancy so
[21:00] sometimes you're reading and it will say
[21:02] sons or children and that Greek word
[21:06] there will be technion and it means
[21:09] infancy it means just born newborn or in
[21:15] toddler stage we might would refer to it
[21:19] in the United States technion te kan io
[21:23] n and then the second word is technol
[21:27] without the AI te KN 0 N and that
[21:32] generally refers to a stage of
[21:35] development in the human life that we
[21:37] would call puberty or adolescence this
[21:41] is in the beginning of the teenage years
[21:43] those years that are extremely difficult
[21:46] in in reality in in real life there are
[21:51] many physical changes and hormonal
[21:54] changes and emotional changes that kick
[21:57] in and start taking place in in a child
[22:00] when they reach that age of puberty or
[22:04] adolescents or in Greek technol but now
[22:07] that word technol is often translated
[22:10] sons and so you need to kind of be able
[22:14] to look at it and see if the scripture
[22:17] says sons is it talking about infant is
[22:19] it talking about puberty or adolescents
[22:23] or is it talking about the third word
[22:26] that is often used for children or sons
[22:29] from the Greek and it's Hugh's H you I
[22:33] OS and it means maturity now we talked
[22:38] about that already when we were looking
[22:41] at our very first program together we
[22:44] looked at that word Hughes and thesis
[22:48] and when you put those words together
[22:50] you get the definition is placing of a
[22:54] mature son and that word is translated
[22:57] from the Greek into
[22:59] as adoption and it's made up of hue
[23:04] switches maturity and thesis which is
[23:07] the placing or the positioning of a
[23:09] mature son so we've got infancy and
[23:12] that's the the Gaga googoo cooing stage
[23:16] of life the scooting stage the crawling
[23:19] around stage and then you've got the
[23:22] that the Technion the the technol the
[23:27] puberty the adolescence the teenage
[23:29] years and then you've got the heels
[23:31] which is the mature the adult and now
[23:36] you know I have to be honest and say you
[23:38] can be an adult in years and not an
[23:41] adult in maturity you can be a teenager
[23:44] in years and be quite mature for your
[23:48] age and in the natural we're talking
[23:52] about and I think it's also this way in
[23:54] the spiritual now these three words
[23:58] reveal to us three stages in normal life
[24:03] development but we're going to put them
[24:05] into the realm of the Spirit and we're
[24:08] going to look at Jesus Yeshua the
[24:11] Messiah he was a covenant man he was a
[24:14] man of the Covenant he was of course the
[24:18] Son of God the Eternal Spirit of the
[24:21] Father incarnate he condescended he came
[24:25] down walked among men and he became he
[24:28] became what we are so that we can become
[24:32] what he is by faith that's the greatest
[24:35] love story that I know of I don't know
[24:38] of a greater love story than that the
[24:40] sacrifice that Jesus made laid aside his
[24:43] splendor and came as a baby and lived
[24:47] and suffered and died and rose again
[24:50] shed his blood paid the price so that I
[24:54] might come to that place of relationship
[24:58] that he had with the father so that he
[25:02] could say when you've seen me you've
[25:03] seen the father I and my father are one
[25:08] he said you and I /
[25:11] will not enjoy that relationship in
[25:14] exactly the same manner as the Lord
[25:17] Jesus who was deity in flesh but we will
[25:20] in a very specific and special way
[25:24] chosen by God we will enjoy that union
[25:28] and that special place and and just how
[25:32] big it is and to what degree it is is
[25:35] somewhat debatable I think it would be a
[25:38] shock to you if you would do the study
[25:40] yourself I think you would find out and
[25:42] you know people sometimes have a problem
[25:46] when you talk about deity and because
[25:49] they don't fully understand what it
[25:51] means to have the Spirit of God living
[25:53] inside of them now I'm a man and I sin
[25:56] and I make mistakes and I have to come
[25:59] to God on a daily basis I'm honest I
[26:02] come to God on a daily basis and
[26:04] although I may not be actively engaged
[26:06] in in committing rebellious acts of sin
[26:11] or or you know what we would think of as
[26:15] wickedness or ungodliness but I
[26:17] constantly have to come to god about my
[26:19] thoughts I have to come to god about
[26:21] feeling critical or are judgmental and
[26:25] so daily we come and we lay our need
[26:29] before the Lord and we tell him and he
[26:31] works on that and he he brings
[26:33] situations into our life to sort of
[26:35] tunis up and to tweak us as a word that
[26:38] we use that that helps us to come into
[26:41] his image ultimately so that we can be
[26:46] active participators in the harvest
[26:49] there's a harvest coming and we are
[26:52] called of God to actively participate
[26:55] with heaven in that final harvest of
[26:58] souls where did my time go I'll never
[27:02] know but we need to praise before we go
[27:04] off the air father I thank you for this
[27:07] day and I thank you for your word it is
[27:10] light it is life it is strength and it
[27:14] brings joy to the inner man it heals our
[27:17] spirit and lord I ask that you would
[27:20] would stir up the hunger that there
[27:23] would be a deep calling in
[27:25] every person who's watching this program
[27:27] right now and that you owe faithful God
[27:30] would respond to that deep calling by
[27:33] releasing the deep truths and mysteries
[27:36] of your kingdom to those who seek for
[27:38] them in the wonderful name of Jesus
[27:41] Yeshua the Messiah we pray amen any man
[27:45] thank you for watching the Eagles cry
[27:47] tune in again next week bye bye for now
