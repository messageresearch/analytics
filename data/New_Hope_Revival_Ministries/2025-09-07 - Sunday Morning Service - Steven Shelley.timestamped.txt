[41:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, I give you praise, Lord, for you are
[41:52] a miracle working God.
[41:56] Oh Jesus.
[41:58] [Music]
[42:00] It took a miracle to hang the stars and
[42:03] the moon and the sun out in their orbit.
[42:08] But oh, what a miracle it was. When you
[42:11] picked me up
[42:14] out of the place that I was,
[42:19] you set my feet on a solid foundation.
[42:23] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, I bless you, Lord.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; I bless you, Lord.
[42:33] [Music]
[42:37] You took me out of darkness
[42:41] and you placed me in your marvelous
[42:44] light.
[42:46] [Music]
[42:48] Because of your grace, Lord, you have
[42:50] continued
[42:52] to deliver me out of my darkness.
[42:57] Every dark place,
[42:59] you continue to deliver because that's
[43:02] who you are. You are light and you are
[43:06] life and in you there is no darkness at
[43:10] all.
[43:11] Oh, I thank you Lord for delivering me
[43:15] out of darkness.
[43:19] Hallelujah.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; The light of life
[43:24] does shine through me in me.
[43:29] The very life of Jesus
[43:32] come back on the believer.
[43:35] Thank you Lord.
[43:38] Oh what a marvelous revelation
[43:41] that he has given us in the end time.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:46] to bring us to complete deliverance.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[43:54] Hallelujah.
[43:57] As we go to prayer today, do you have a
[43:59] need just by lifting your hand?
[44:02] I have a need in my heart and I need the
[44:05] Lord to move on my behalf.
[44:08] And he does. He will. Out across the
[44:12] stream, the Lord sees the need that you
[44:14] have.
[44:16] request was put in for Sister Sherry
[44:19] Farmer's brother-in-law, Brother Marty
[44:22] Mccomomas, a pastor of a small church in
[44:25] Arkansas. He's in need of the healing
[44:28] touch of the Lord, a miracle. Let's ask
[44:31] the Lord to do that for him. Brother
[44:33] Farmer is preaching there today. We want
[44:35] to ask the Lord to help him. Sister
[44:37] Kathy is not well today. We want to
[44:40] remember her and ask the Lord to
[44:41] minister to her.
[44:45] strep throat. They wanted to ask us to
[44:49] pray and Samantha asked that we pray
[44:51] that the Lord would make a way that they
[44:53] could could be more often here. We would
[44:57] like to see that for sure.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; Sister Isabelle Williams is at home
[45:01] today and she needs the strength of the
[45:04] Lord
[45:05] &gt;&gt; and she needs God's perfect healing in
[45:07] her body.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. and uh she had a doctor's
[45:11] report this week from the emergency room
[45:13] that uh there was something going on in
[45:16] in uh like a mass or something like
[45:19] that. But uh it could be many things and
[45:24] God knows exactly what it is. And we're
[45:27] believing that she will fight with her
[45:30] faith.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; And that we'll fight with her with our
[45:33] faith and that God will give a miracle.
[45:36] He's a miracle working God. Oh yes.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; I remember my grandmother telling the
[45:41] doctor I was there. She took a few
[45:44] radiation treatments
[45:46] after the surgery that discovered the
[45:49] cancer in her lungs. And I remember the
[45:52] doctor her telling the doctor uh I can't
[45:56] do any more of this because it's burning
[45:58] me up. I feel like I'm burning from the
[46:01] inside out and I can't take any more of
[46:03] these treatments.
[46:05] remember she had gone almost 40 years
[46:08] without an aspirin so any medicine
[46:12] affected her but of course she the
[46:15] radiation was more than she could take
[46:17] and he said well you won't live but a
[46:20] very short time and she said well thank
[46:22] you for your professional opinion I I
[46:26] respected her I wouldn't be here but she
[46:29] said you don't get to tell me when to
[46:31] die
[46:31] &gt;&gt; right
[46:33] &gt;&gt; she said my creator Peter
[46:36] &gt;&gt; will tell me when to die and I won't die
[46:38] until he tells me till he calls me.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; And uh she said I don't mean to be
[46:43] obstinate but she said I don't expect to
[46:46] go anywhere for for some time. And she
[46:49] didn't.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; God gave her a lot of victory and a lot
[46:53] of healing
[46:54] &gt;&gt; until she could kind of finish some
[46:56] things. There were still some people
[46:58] that she needed to talk to about this
[47:00] message
[47:01] &gt;&gt; that had criticized it to her and she
[47:04] was so young just beginning to learn
[47:06] what we would share with her and
[47:08] listening to the tapes herself. She
[47:10] didn't stand up for it like she thought
[47:12] she should have.
[47:14] And so she said, "I'd like to live long
[47:16] enough to stand up
[47:18] &gt;&gt; to defend what I know God has done."
[47:21] &gt;&gt; That really helped me. It really touched
[47:23] my life. Let's believe for brother Bobby
[47:26] words also that God will give it. He is
[47:30] undergoing lots of treatment and it
[47:33] weakens his body but we believe that God
[47:36] is more than able
[47:38] &gt;&gt; uh to do exceedingly and abundantly
[47:41] above
[47:43] and know I know there's unspoken
[47:44] request. I have a little sister on my
[47:48] heart today that God sees her need and
[47:50] I'd like for the Lord to move on her
[47:52] behalf. Yes,
[47:54] &gt;&gt; she's weary in mind and body. But God is
[47:58] more than a healer.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; He's a creator.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; He is a miracle working God.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; My Lord and my God.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; I worship you.
[48:19] You are great and you are the God of
[48:23] miracles.
[48:25] As you did yesterday, you still do today
[48:29] and you will do tomorrow. You are God of
[48:32] miracles
[48:34] and I thank you Lord for every miracle
[48:37] you let my eye behold.
[48:41] I thank you for the miracle of salvation
[48:44] and the miracle of the baptism of the
[48:47] Holy Ghost that you gave to me. Lord, it
[48:51] was not something that man could give to
[48:53] an individual.
[48:55] Man cannot save and man cannot baptize
[48:59] in the Holy Ghost. That is from your
[49:02] hand, Lord. And we thank you for it. We
[49:06] thank you for ears to hear that we've
[49:09] been able to hear a message in the end
[49:12] time. We thank you for a voice that you
[49:15] have placed among us that would deliver
[49:18] this truth without fear or without favor
[49:21] of men. I bless him and thank you that
[49:24] you have placed him among us. Oh Lord,
[49:27] would you strengthen him even as he
[49:30] would step behind this desk today? I
[49:33] pray God that our ears would be tuned to
[49:37] heaven's frequency and that we would not
[49:40] be distracted by earth's frequency. I
[49:43] ask you, oh Lord, that you would come by
[49:46] the power of your resurrection and raise
[49:49] us up into heavenly places in Christ
[49:53] Jesus today. Lord, I thank you that you
[49:57] have already placed angels around this
[50:00] room. You have commissioned them among
[50:03] us today. And because we believe that we
[50:07] are living under an open heaven, we
[50:09] thank you that they are ascending and
[50:12] descending in our midst today, bringing
[50:15] treasures from the treasury room of
[50:18] heaven. I thank you, oh God, that you
[50:22] heard the requests that were made known
[50:25] among us today. many healings that are
[50:28] needed, miracles that are needed. But
[50:31] again, I thank you that you are the God
[50:33] of miracles. And so we just decree the
[50:37] miracle working power of God for brother
[50:41] Marty, for sister Williams, for Sister
[50:43] Kathy, for Jameson, for Sister Williams.
[50:46] Lord, we believe that that's who you
[50:49] are. Oh Lord, I thank you that you're
[50:52] ministering miracle to brother Bobby WZ.
[50:56] Oh God, anyone among us that needs a
[50:59] miracle today,
[51:02] not just in a physical healing, but
[51:04] Lord, there's some struggling in their
[51:07] minds. And I pray God that you would
[51:10] deliver that miracle today. That the
[51:13] darkness that has tried to invade their
[51:16] territory would be put in its place in
[51:20] the name of Jesus Christ.
[51:24] Oh Lord,
[51:26] &gt;&gt; that darkness is invasive.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; But God, you are God of light. It is
[51:32] not. That darkness is not from you. That
[51:35] darkness is from the underworld. And so
[51:38] we take authority in the name of Jesus
[51:40] Christ. And we confess the light, the
[51:43] glorious light of the Lord Jesus Christ
[51:47] to come and minister to these that are
[51:50] struggling.
[51:52] Oh, I thank you, Lord. That's who you
[51:54] are. We give you praise. We give you
[51:57] honor. As this service continues today,
[52:00] Lord, may we all be in our proper
[52:03] positions in the spirit. May we not get
[52:06] out of line, get out of position, but
[52:09] may we stay in our position that you can
[52:12] accomplish the fullest in this house
[52:15] today. out across the stream. You see
[52:18] all of the needs, but God, I pray that
[52:21] they would be in their positions today
[52:23] for the glory of the Lord. We surrender
[52:27] our will fully to you that you can do
[52:30] what you want to do and as long as you
[52:33] want to do it.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; We surrender.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; Once again, I yield my will to you,
[52:43] Lord. have your way
[52:45] &gt;&gt; in the name that is above every name,
[52:49] &gt;&gt; the Lord Jesus Christ.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:54] For you are great.
[52:59] You do miracles
[53:03] so great.
[53:07] There is no one else like you.
[53:13] [Music]
[53:15] There is no
[53:17] one else like you.

[53:33] [Music]
[53:38] like you.
[53:40] [Music]
[53:42] There is no
[53:44] one else like you.
[53:52] Now put your hands together and give him
[53:54] a gl great clap of praise.

[54:55] For you are great.
[55:00] You do miracles.
[55:03] [Music]
[55:08] There is no
[55:11] one else
[55:12] like you.
[55:16] There is no
[55:20] like you.
[55:26] To you Lord be all glory and praise.
[55:31] Glory and praise.
[55:37] 10,000 hallelujah
[55:41] that would bring honor to your name.
[55:45] Hallelujah.
[55:49] Hallelujah.
[55:52] You may have your seats today.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; This life
[56:06] is because of you, Lord.

[57:40] We worship you Lord.
[57:59] Hallelujah.
[58:08] Thank you, Lord.
[58:15] We're so grateful for those messengers
[58:17] from heaven.
[58:24] They're not random.
[58:27] They move in divine order.
[58:36] They don't get the wrong place at the
[58:38] wrong time.
[58:41] Every one of them are at the right place
[58:46] at the right time.
[58:49] And we welcome them.
[58:53] We welcome them.
[58:56] Hallelujah.
[59:04] As we welcome them, we welcome you in
[59:06] the house of the Lord. Today,
[59:11] &gt;&gt; we're here to
[59:13] lift up the name of Jesus,
[59:17] [Music]
[59:20] &gt;&gt; the Lord Jesus Christ,
[59:24] Yeshua, the Messiah.
[59:36] God is a spirit.
[59:42] He couldn't be seen
[59:47] and he knew he couldn't redeem us
[59:52] as a human race fallen.
[59:58] So he created a body and stepped into
[1:00:00] it.
[1:00:03] Came down to redeem.
[1:00:07] Oh, what a plan he has.
[1:00:12] Embrace it, my friend.
[1:00:15] Embrace the plan of God in your life.
[1:00:20] God makes no mistakes.
[1:00:24] He is perfect in all of his ways.
[1:00:29] Oh, what plans he has.
[1:00:32] And that plan that he had was to bring a
[1:00:36] body
[1:00:38] that he would call by his own name
[1:00:42] back to himself.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Perfect, complete.
[1:00:48] Hallelujah.
[1:00:52] We continue to worship today as we give
[1:00:56] of our tithe and offering. Brother Cade
[1:00:58] is going to slip over to the piano and
[1:01:01] we're going to continue to worship with
[1:01:02] him.
[1:01:06] Don't want to dwell on it, but I just
[1:01:07] want you to know that I got confirmation
[1:01:11] earlier today that work will proceed on
[1:01:14] Wednesday. I don't know what time. I
[1:01:17] don't know all the logistics, but I will
[1:01:19] try to give the logistics to you as I
[1:01:22] know them. Just pay attention.
[1:01:26] Austin, will you and Jonathan come and
[1:01:29] receive the tithe and offering as we're
[1:01:31] worshiping? Pay attention to the roads.
[1:01:34] Pay attention to the app. Pay attention
[1:01:36] to text. We'll do what we can for
[1:01:39] especially those of you that live here
[1:01:41] on the ground. Father, I thank you for
[1:01:44] givers. I thank you that they keep
[1:01:45] covenant with you. And as we give our
[1:01:48] tithe and offering today, we continue to
[1:01:51] worship by doing just that, giving of
[1:01:54] our tithe and offering to you. For you
[1:01:56] are good and merciful, and you supply
[1:01:59] every need, both for our families and
[1:02:01] for this ministry, that your work can be
[1:02:04] accomplished in the end time. We give
[1:02:06] you praise in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:02:08] Christ. Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[1:02:16] [Music]
[1:02:29] As I kneel in the darkness
[1:02:33] in the middle of the night,
[1:02:38] I'm praying for assurance.
[1:02:42] Everything's going to be all right.
[1:02:45] And Lord, I see another battle.
[1:02:49] It's down in front of me.
[1:02:53] And I'm afraid I won't be able
[1:02:57] and I'll go down in defeat.
[1:03:02] And he said, "Do you remember
[1:03:07] where I brought you from?
[1:03:11] Just take a look behind you and how far
[1:03:16] you've come.
[1:03:18] Oh, and every time you ask me, did it
[1:03:23] not deliver you?
[1:03:26] So why would you be thinking
[1:03:30] that I wouldn't see you through?
[1:03:35] Didn't I walk on the water
[1:03:40] and I called the raging sea?
[1:03:43] I spoke to the wind
[1:03:47] and it husted and I gave you peace.
[1:03:51] Didn't I run to your rescue? Didn't I
[1:03:55] hear you when you called?
[1:03:59] I walked right beside you just so you
[1:04:04] wouldn't fall.
[1:04:08] Now she's talking to her father
[1:04:12] in a house that was once a home. She
[1:04:16] said, "My bills are coming due, Lord,
[1:04:19] and six days is not that long." She
[1:04:23] hears a voice so soft and low.
[1:04:27] says, "I've moved like that before
[1:04:31] and I'll do this little thing, child,
[1:04:35] and I'll give you so much more."
[1:04:40] Then I walk on the water, and I calm the
[1:04:45] raging sea.
[1:04:48] I spoke to the wind
[1:04:51] and it hushed and I gave you peace. Then
[1:04:55] I run to your rescue. Didn't I hear you
[1:05:00] when you call?
[1:05:03] I walked right beside you just so you
[1:05:08] wouldn't fall. Then I leave all of
[1:05:12] heaven just to die for your sin.
[1:05:18] I searched until I found you. And I do
[1:05:22] it all again.
[1:05:27] As I kneel in the darkness,
[1:05:31] in the middle of the night, I keep
[1:05:35] praying for assurance that everything's
[1:05:39] going to be all right.
[1:05:42] Lord, I see another battle.
[1:05:46] It's down right in front of me.
[1:05:49] And I'm afraid I won't be able.
[1:05:53] and I'll go down in the feed.
[1:05:58] And he says, "Do you remember
[1:06:03] just where I brought you from?
[1:06:07] Take a look behind you and see how far
[1:06:12] you've come.
[1:06:14] Oh, and every time you ask me, did not
[1:06:19] deliver you."
[1:06:21] So why would you be thinking that I
[1:06:25] wouldn't see you through?
[1:06:30] Didn't I walk on the water
[1:06:34] and I calmed the raging sea?
[1:06:38] I spoke to the wind
[1:06:41] and it hushed and I gave you peace.
[1:06:45] Didn't I run to your rescue? Didn't I
[1:06:49] hear you when you call?
[1:06:53] Well, I walked right beside you just so
[1:06:57] you wouldn't fall. Didn't I leave all of
[1:07:02] heaven?
[1:07:04] Just die for your sin.
[1:07:07] Well, I searched right until I found
[1:07:10] you. And I knew it all again.
[1:07:16] And in I walk on the water and I called
[1:07:21] your agency.

[1:07:58] it all again.
[1:08:02] And didn't I walk on the water?
[1:08:06] And I calmed the raging sea.

[1:08:14] and it hushed and I gave you peace.

[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Some of us have tried to live from our
[1:14:42] own substance, from our own life, but
[1:14:46] there is no life for a believer outside
[1:14:50] of the true vine.

[1:15:26] forever in a tent, you would have.
[1:15:31] [Music]
[1:15:33] But you desired a body.
[1:15:37] You desired a company, a people
[1:15:41] totally surrendered
[1:15:44] to the perfect mind of God.
[1:15:47] Totally surrendered.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Oh,

[1:16:47] how you respond.

[1:17:55] You've got to make time. You've got to
[1:17:57] make room
[1:18:00] for me in your life.
[1:18:03] You've crowded me out. You've pushed me
[1:18:06] away.
[1:18:10] You've spoken contrary
[1:18:12] to my word concerning yourself,
[1:18:16] concerning others.
[1:18:19] So I call you into my side.
[1:18:25] Draw strength.
[1:18:28] Draw life.
[1:18:31] Your religious busyiness
[1:18:34] produces no fruit.

[1:18:44] to me.

[1:19:20] Lord, this is our desire
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; to yield to oneness.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Would you please show somebody this
[1:19:30] morning that it is not religion,
[1:19:33] it's relationship.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; You're not looking for performance.
[1:19:40] You're looking for yieldedness that
[1:19:42] comes from nothingness.
[1:19:46] Lord, show some of us today that Enoch
[1:19:49] was not because he was not.
[1:19:54] Show some of us today that he had to
[1:19:56] empty himself of his own will,
[1:20:00] forfeit his own agenda
[1:20:03] so that he could be was not
[1:20:08] translated into another dimension.
[1:20:11] He had to empty himself of his own
[1:20:13] thoughts and opinions and
[1:20:17] inner struggles and and then he just
[1:20:20] went walking with you.
[1:20:22] [Music]
[1:20:24] Lord, you're going to have a people who
[1:20:26] walk with you in the cool of the evening
[1:20:30] and they find the strength from you that
[1:20:32] they need to get through whatever it is
[1:20:34] that life is dishing out.
[1:20:38] Would you just lift your hands to him?
[1:20:41] Just lift your hands to him and just
[1:20:43] love him. I know this is very foreign,
[1:20:45] this kind of atmosphere for some folks,
[1:20:48] but this is this is the atmosphere I
[1:20:51] thrive. This is the atmosphere I was
[1:20:54] created to live in. So, uh, please, I
[1:20:57] don't want to disturb it for another
[1:20:59] moment or two because it's just peace
[1:21:02] and life and strength to me. It's like
[1:21:04] an IV. It's like an umbilical cord
[1:21:09] when the when the when the very mind of
[1:21:11] God is in the building. Thank you,
[1:21:13] Father. Thank you, Father, that you love
[1:21:15] this little group of people here so much
[1:21:17] that you would come to us today.
[1:21:21] And even with all the moving and the
[1:21:23] distraction and all of the emotion that
[1:21:26] goes on to try to get us to this place,
[1:21:29] the enemy will magnify and amplify human
[1:21:33] emotions to keep us from this place. But
[1:21:36] we're here, Lord. We're here because of
[1:21:38] your willingness
[1:21:40] to draw us up.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Come, my beloved,
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; walk with me.
[1:21:52] Walk with me.
[1:21:54] Come my beloved,
[1:21:59] walk
[1:22:00] with me
[1:22:05] [Music]

[1:22:11] through the terror by night.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Walk with me.
[1:22:18] Oh, for you are mine.

[1:23:08] this life. Get up above this life. Get
[1:23:13] up above this life.
[1:23:16] Walk with me through heavenly places.
[1:23:21] Walk with me through realms of life and
[1:23:25] hope and faith and love.
[1:23:31] Get up above
[1:23:35] your own thoughts
[1:23:38] until you find the thoughts of the Lord.
[1:23:43] [Music]
[1:23:45] Come my beloved
[1:23:49] and walk.
[1:23:52] Walk with me.
[1:23:57] [Music]

[1:24:08] you. I'll take you. I'll take you at
[1:24:11] your word. Hallelujah.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; I'll walk with you through heavenly
[1:24:15] places. I'll walk with you through peace
[1:24:18] and through love. Whatever Lord you've
[1:24:20] got, I'll walk with you. Oh, if you'll
[1:24:23] just not leave us alone in this hour,
[1:24:25] we'll walk with you, Jesus. We'll
[1:24:27] surrender. Hallelujah.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Walk with me.
[1:24:43] my beloved.
[1:24:47] Now, we're going to the word, but just
[1:24:49] before we do, sing this back to him.
[1:24:51] I'll walk with you.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; My beloved,
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; I will talk with you.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; My beloved,
[1:25:04] my heart is yours.
[1:25:08] Your love is mine,
[1:25:10] [Music]
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; my beloved.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; You're just responding to his voice by
[1:25:18] saying, "Yes, Lord, I will. I will walk
[1:25:20] with you.
[1:25:22] I will talk with you,
[1:25:26] my beloved.
[1:25:29] [Music]
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Your word will be my banquet.
[1:25:36] shall be my food
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; where my strength comes from.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; I will walk with you. Tell him one more
[1:25:45] time. I will walk with you,
[1:25:50] my beloved.
[1:25:53] I will talk with you,
[1:25:57] my beloved.
[1:25:59] [Music]
[1:26:01] My heart is yours.
[1:26:04] Your love is mine,
[1:26:08] my beloved.
[1:26:13] What a joy to know that I am my beloveds
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; and my beloved is mine.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; How many of you are glad that he is
[1:26:24] yours and you are his
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; and you know it beyond the shadow of any
[1:26:31] doubt?
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Let me see your hand. Do you know it?
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Are you surrendering to that every day
[1:26:38] or just when you come to church or just
[1:26:41] when you feel like it or are you
[1:26:43] surrendering to that call every day of
[1:26:45] your life? You must you will not survive
[1:26:49] this last hour spiritually. You will not
[1:26:52] thrive or survive in this last hour if
[1:26:56] you treat him like a like a one time
[1:27:00] like a one time a week thing. Oh no. It
[1:27:03] takes daily fellowship. It takes day.
[1:27:07] You people that are saying amen. Is that
[1:27:09] because you do it
[1:27:13] or because you know it's true? It's
[1:27:15] true, isn't it?
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; It's true. But we're there there is no
[1:27:19] other hiding place but in him.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; He knows us, doesn't he? I don't want to
[1:27:24] disturb the atmosphere that we're in,
[1:27:26] but I know the Lord's heart is pleased
[1:27:28] with the gifts that he's placed in these
[1:27:31] precious people's lives. So, let's give
[1:27:33] God honor.
[1:27:38] [Music]
[1:27:41] Uh, I need your help at the end of the
[1:27:43] service to make another announcement and
[1:27:46] I could make it now, but I don't want to
[1:27:48] be responsible for shifting this that I
[1:27:51] feel right now. And so I'll I'll if
[1:27:54] you'll remind me, I'll make an
[1:27:56] announcement concerning just just let me
[1:27:58] say this as we're going. We're we're uh
[1:28:01] we're getting toward our capacity
[1:28:05] for the banquet. So you need to be aware
[1:28:08] of that. And at the end of the service,
[1:28:11] uh I'll mention to you what we need you
[1:28:13] to do if you plan to join us or if you
[1:28:15] have someone staying with you and you
[1:28:17] feel like they're going going to want to
[1:28:19] be here and so forth. Sometimes people
[1:28:22] will reach out and we won't even know
[1:28:25] they're coming, but some of you will
[1:28:26] know. And this time it's going to be
[1:28:28] imperative for us to know because we're
[1:28:31] we're getting we're getting up there.
[1:28:33] Praise God. That means we're going to
[1:28:34] have a wonderful group of people for
[1:28:36] camp meeting. Amen.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Isaiah chapter 1
[1:28:41] and we're going to verse 16.
[1:28:45] I realize that we've spent some extra
[1:28:47] time. I tell you right now that won't
[1:28:50] hurt you.
[1:28:51] and it won't hurt me
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; to spend a little extra time in his
[1:28:56] presence.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; And if I were you, if you can get in
[1:28:59] that channel, I wouldn't be moving
[1:29:00] around in that moment. I I I I would
[1:29:04] hold myself
[1:29:06] uh in that kind of an atmosphere. I
[1:29:09] wouldn't want to budge if I didn't have
[1:29:11] to budge. A
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; and I know that people sometimes are not
[1:29:16] sensitive to that because you can see
[1:29:18] the way they just carry on. they just
[1:29:19] continue doing what they're doing. It
[1:29:22] reminds me of the Pentecostals when uh
[1:29:25] messages and tongues and interpretation
[1:29:27] and things would happen uh there toward
[1:29:30] the end. They were so used to it. It was
[1:29:33] so common until people would get up and
[1:29:36] go to the bathroom. It's supposed to be
[1:29:39] I I don't know that it always was, but
[1:29:41] it's supposed to be the voice of God in
[1:29:44] the house.
[1:29:47] I can't imagine, you know, somebody uh
[1:29:50] not honoring and respecting that moment
[1:29:53] if we really believed that God was
[1:29:57] moving. So, um we want to be sensitive
[1:30:00] to the spirit of the Lord. There's a
[1:30:03] time to be funny
[1:30:05] and there's a time to be sober.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And sensitive. Isaiah chapter 1.
[1:30:12] I'm going somewhere today that I don't
[1:30:15] uh delight in going, but I know that I I
[1:30:19] have to and putting it off. It's not
[1:30:21] going to help me and it's not going to
[1:30:23] help you. So, I want to share with you
[1:30:27] uh some some scriptures and some
[1:30:29] thoughts concerning something that
[1:30:33] happened to me. Uh I shared it. It
[1:30:37] happened on Saturday night, August the
[1:30:39] 23rd, but I shared a piece of it with
[1:30:42] you on Sunday morning, August the 24th.
[1:30:46] And I want to share uh some scriptures
[1:30:48] to go along with it because God has been
[1:30:50] so gracious to give me some more
[1:30:52] understanding of what it is that he is
[1:30:55] uh talking to us about in this hour. I
[1:30:58] just want to hear him. You know, there's
[1:31:01] no no shortage of things to preach.
[1:31:05] It's a big book.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; It's full. And the message of the hour
[1:31:11] is full.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Nearly 1,200 sermons we can pull from.
[1:31:16] And I love to do it. But oh my, if we if
[1:31:19] we if we do that and we miss
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; what the Lord would I want to know what
[1:31:25] he would say to me now.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Uh if there were there not there's not a
[1:31:32] prophet messenger. It's finished. There
[1:31:36] won't be an eighth one. But but if if
[1:31:38] there were to be one, I would I would
[1:31:41] want to know what what he had to say. I
[1:31:44] I mean, what I'm saying by that, I hope
[1:31:46] you won't misunderstand. I mean, I would
[1:31:48] want to What would What would Brother
[1:31:50] Brand Let's say it this way. What would
[1:31:52] Brother Brandham talk about if he were
[1:31:53] here today?
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; I want to know. I want to know that
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; he's not. And God didn't make a mistake.
[1:32:02] But I don't want to just be in the
[1:32:04] middle of a series and just hang there
[1:32:06] because there's nowhere else to be.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; I want to be led by the spirit.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; I need your prayers
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; always.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; I I don't have to tell you how to pray.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; I don't even know how. Brother David
[1:32:18] reached out. He said, "Tell me how to
[1:32:20] pray. I I don't know how to tell you to
[1:32:22] pray for my family. Just pray."
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; Let's pray that we can always please
[1:32:27] him. Isaiah 1 verse 16 through 20. wash
[1:32:32] you,
[1:32:33] make you clean. Put away the evil of
[1:32:37] your doings from before mine eyes.
[1:32:41] Cease to do evil.
[1:32:44] Learn to do well. Seek judgment, which
[1:32:49] is justice here. Relieve the oppressed.
[1:32:54] Do you hear it?
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; You don't have to go looking far to find
[1:32:58] oppressed. They may be sitting beside
[1:33:01] you on the pew this morning. Relieve the
[1:33:04] oppressed. Judge the fatherless. Plead
[1:33:08] for the widow. And again, this word
[1:33:10] judgment is a word that means render
[1:33:13] justice to. Come now and let us reason
[1:33:18] together. This is not the human
[1:33:20] reasoning that caused Eve to go astray.
[1:33:23] This is spiritual uh meditation. It's
[1:33:27] spiritual ponderings.
[1:33:29] It means let us see the whole picture.
[1:33:33] Come now and let us reason together,
[1:33:36] sayaeth the Lord. Though your sins be as
[1:33:39] scarlet,
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; they shall be as
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; white as snow. Though they be red like
[1:33:47] crimson, they shall be
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; as
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; white like wool.
[1:33:53] Isn't that wonderful? And here is it's
[1:33:57] the key. It's not just the key to
[1:34:00] Isaiah's prophecy. It's the key to 2025.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; If ye be willing.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; If ye be willing,
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; some are willing
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; as long as it's comfortable,
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; But when you say yes, you're not just
[1:34:23] yesing. comfortable assignment.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; You're yesing the mind of God. Whatever
[1:34:29] he wants to do in you and for you and
[1:34:32] through you. If you be willing
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; and
[1:34:37] [Music]
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; obedient,
[1:34:42] you shall eat
[1:34:47] the good of the land. Amen.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; That not that's not United States of
[1:34:53] America land. That's spiritual promised
[1:34:58] land.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Your spiritual inheritance,
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; you'll eat it.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; If you be
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; willing
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; and obedient. I know we know this, but
[1:35:10] if you be willing
[1:35:13] and obedient,
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; both
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; conjunction and willing and willing and
[1:35:21] obedient, ye shall eat the good of the
[1:35:25] promise.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; The good of the land.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; You will eat it because you have
[1:35:31] occupied it.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; You will occupy your promise. You will
[1:35:35] live in and on your promise. If you be
[1:35:39] willing and obedient.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; If you be willing and obedient, you
[1:35:44] shall eat the benefit of the promise.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; You shall be the beneficiary.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Of the promise.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Woo. Isn't that good news?
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. God add his blessing
[1:36:00] to the reading of his word. The next
[1:36:02] verse. But if somebody say if.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; I know. I know you you you you may be
[1:36:10] too tired for class participation, but I
[1:36:13] need I need class participation. If
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; big word,
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; just two little letters,
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; but it's a huge word. If
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; if if
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; if you refuse,
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; if you be willing and obedient, ye shall
[1:36:41] possess,
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:36:44] Not only will you possess, you will have
[1:36:47] strength, power, and authority to
[1:36:49] dispossess
[1:36:51] what is squatting
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; on your inheritance.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; The devil refuses to budge many times
[1:37:01] until you address him with the authority
[1:37:05] that's given to you as a part. You're a
[1:37:08] part of God. You're a part of the very
[1:37:12] creator, the very one who created him.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; And when you use bridal authority, the
[1:37:20] authority of an adopted son, a fully
[1:37:22] adopted son, a whos, not a tetanon, not
[1:37:26] a toddler.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; But a man,
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; when I became a man, I put away.
[1:37:34] I want to tell you as your pastor this
[1:37:37] morning, it's well past the time.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; For us to put away childish things.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; I know some of you are are are immature
[1:37:50] by nature and you were raised by
[1:37:52] immature people.
[1:37:55] And so there are many ways that we mimic
[1:37:58] and copy the behavior, the decision
[1:38:02] making process of how we were brought
[1:38:05] up, the environment that we brought up
[1:38:07] in. And we saw mama go all to pieces
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; over everything that happened,
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; And we saw daddy go silent.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; He just clammed up like a big old clam.
[1:38:22] He didn't help mama.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Get up, woman.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; We're going to make this together.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Come on now."
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; He clammed up. He went outside.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Left mama in the floor.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Right. Because his heart, his pain, his
[1:38:46] he he was dealing with it his way. you
[1:38:49] you can get by with that in church
[1:38:52] annity,
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; but we're we must be beyond church
[1:38:56] annity.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; We're in adoption.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; And the adopted sons of God are
[1:39:04] manifesting who he is
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; and not the environment that we brought
[1:39:10] were brought up in.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; It's time for us to grow up. Yeah.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Sounds like you're I can't help it.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; I can't help the hat I'm wearing today.
[1:39:21] I didn't choose this hat. I didn't know
[1:39:24] this. I'm just going to be obedient.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; I didn't come to play. I don't think you
[1:39:29] came to play.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; At least you came. Some didn't come at
[1:39:33] all. I'm glad you came. But I'm telling
[1:39:36] you what, the the it's time to put away
[1:39:40] childish things. so many times through
[1:39:43] the 35 years that we have been together
[1:39:48] as a body of believers. 35
[1:39:52] years.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; So many times in 35 years, the spirit of
[1:39:58] God has moved us up into a place
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; where we ought to have been able to
[1:40:05] activate everything that we believe.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:11] We should have been able to understand
[1:40:14] by revelation what we believe
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; you know some people don't even know
[1:40:20] what they believe and around this
[1:40:22] message they make such stupid statements
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; and they say well you don't even have
[1:40:29] you know you don't really have to know
[1:40:30] just just believe you really don't have
[1:40:32] to know what you believe you don't
[1:40:33] really have to know I don't believe that
[1:40:35] God opened up
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; the mysteries of the ages is
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; to leave us more confused than we were
[1:40:43] before we knew there were mysteries.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; I wasn't as confused in Pentecost as
[1:40:49] some people are now
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; in this message.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; That is not what the truth come to do.
[1:40:56] And that is not God's fault and it's not
[1:41:00] brother Brandham's fault.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; The responsibility falls on ourselves.
[1:41:06] You know, somebody will always uh
[1:41:09] inadvertently come along and they want
[1:41:10] to instruct us or school us in the
[1:41:13] message and and that's all right. I've
[1:41:16] got lots to learn, but I'm not going to
[1:41:19] learn it from somebody who just repeats
[1:41:21] what their pastor says.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to learn much from
[1:41:24] somebody who's just a parent.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; I'm going to learn from somebody who's
[1:41:28] had a touch of heaven in their life.
[1:41:31] It's fallen on the word that God has
[1:41:33] given us a generation ago and it has now
[1:41:36] become a personal revelation in their
[1:41:38] life. And they can not only talk about
[1:41:41] it, they can demonstrate it.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; When there has to be the full
[1:41:47] manifestation of such as that if we're
[1:41:49] ever going to take a rapture,
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; I don't know what people are expecting
[1:41:54] the rapture to be, but it's not going to
[1:41:56] be anything until
[1:42:02] When I was a child, I I I acted as a
[1:42:05] child. I spoke as a child. I got my
[1:42:07] feelings hurt all the time.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Just like a little child, you add a new
[1:42:12] baby to the family and sometimes the the
[1:42:15] the present child feels displaced and
[1:42:19] misplaced and put out. And um I told you
[1:42:23] how foolish. I'm not a I'm not a jealous
[1:42:26] person by nature. My wife can tell you
[1:42:28] that I'm not a jealous person by nature,
[1:42:31] but when our first baby come along, I I
[1:42:34] wasn't jealous of my wife's attention
[1:42:36] toward the baby because I knew that he
[1:42:39] needed her,
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; but I just felt bad because everybody
[1:42:44] else was holding the baby and I wasn't
[1:42:46] getting all the turns I wanted.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; That was sweet, but it was childish.
[1:42:55] I didn't do it out of some bad intent,
[1:42:58] but I just thought, well, my goodness,
[1:43:00] everybody comes in, they just grab the
[1:43:02] baby and and and I want to hold him.
[1:43:07] And then about three years into it, I
[1:43:10] was looking for somebody that would hold
[1:43:11] him. You know how that works.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; So, so we grow up
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; and we look at things differently. And
[1:43:20] I've told you before, when the pacifier
[1:43:22] fell, we scalded it.
[1:43:29] When we heard that pregnant women
[1:43:31] shouldn't eat chocolate,
[1:43:33] I hid all the threw I threw some out.
[1:43:37] Little did I know, my wife had a stash.
[1:43:42] No wonder the B no wonder Benjamin
[1:43:44] turned out odd.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; She was sneaking chocolate.
[1:43:50] We wanted to do everything right,
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; but we were a little bit immature. I
[1:43:56] wouldn't say particularly naive, but we
[1:43:58] were certainly immature.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; And you can't do it all right. You you
[1:44:02] everything. By the time we had boiled
[1:44:05] that paci and had to replace it so many
[1:44:08] times cuz we had boiled the rubber
[1:44:09] loose.
[1:44:12] Then we started picking it up, licking
[1:44:14] it off
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; and popping it in his mouth. Before it
[1:44:18] was over, I just picked it up and put in
[1:44:20] his mouth.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; You grow, you realize you can't panic
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; because you're growing up. The spirit of
[1:44:29] the Lord is calling a people in this
[1:44:32] hour to grow up now some
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; instead of thriving on on confusion and
[1:44:39] thriving on on drama.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Some people are miserable unless there's
[1:44:47] a stink that's stirring.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Woo. Let me loosen my tie and let me
[1:44:55] amen the preacher. Amen.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; They have so adapted
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; to this confusing atmosphere
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; that if it's not there,
[1:45:13] they miss it.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; They can't function unless there's some
[1:45:17] kind of stink
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; that's stirring.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; I love peace in my family. I don't know
[1:45:27] why people like
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; chaos,
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Babylon,
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; confusion.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; You're you're tiptoeing around Sally and
[1:45:40] Oh, sorry, Sally.
[1:45:43] tiptoeing around
[1:45:46] Genevieve.
[1:45:52] When my mother was looking for a name,
[1:45:54] she'd say Meratroid.
[1:45:57] I hope that's not ugly.
[1:46:00] You You're tiptoeing around Mergroid.
[1:46:07] Javante
[1:46:11] names you don't know where what planet
[1:46:13] sometime they come from. Some mamas my
[1:46:18] they call it creative.
[1:46:21] I I think it's challenged a little
[1:46:23] myself. But anyway, you you're tiptoeing
[1:46:26] around ant and tiptoeing around. You're
[1:46:29] walking on eggshells. It's all right if
[1:46:32] it's out there. If it's your your
[1:46:34] unsaved, lost, unregenerated
[1:46:38] family and you're trying to be a light
[1:46:40] to them. But believers, believers,
[1:46:45] Holy Ghost fil word believers
[1:46:50] and they thrive. They only come alive
[1:46:53] sometime when there's some kind of
[1:46:56] confusion and if it starts dying down,
[1:46:59] they grab a big old spoon and they stir
[1:47:02] it more and more to keep something going
[1:47:06] all the time. If you be willing and
[1:47:11] obedient,
[1:47:12] you'll eat the good of the land.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; If you grow up,
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; you'll eat the good of the land.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; But if you refuse
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; and rebel me, if I refuse and rebel,
[1:47:33] I will be devoured.
[1:47:38] Yes, sir.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; With a sword.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; For the mouth,
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; huh?
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken
[1:47:48] it. If you be willing,
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; there's too much performance. Yes,
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; I s I see it often here even people
[1:48:01] spending the whole worship hour looking
[1:48:03] around
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; to see what everybody else is doing.
[1:48:08] You're going to miss your chance.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; The only time they put on a little
[1:48:13] worship is when they realize somebody's
[1:48:16] watching them. Sure they are.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; sure, somebody's going to be watching
[1:48:21] you. But I tell you, the kind of praise
[1:48:24] you put on because you think somebody's
[1:48:26] watching you is not the praise that's
[1:48:28] going to pull you up into a higher
[1:48:30] atmosphere to have your needs met and
[1:48:34] and have your faith anchored in the
[1:48:36] word.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; I tell you, there's so much pretense in
[1:48:40] this late hour, 35
[1:48:44] years
[1:48:45] later. There's so much pretense
[1:48:49] still in people's lives. Uh a
[1:48:53] performance mentality
[1:48:55] a and it's got to go. It's got to go.
[1:48:59] It's got to go. It's got to go. It has
[1:49:02] to leave us because it's time to be
[1:49:05] willing and obedient.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Willing and obedient. You're never going
[1:49:10] to like everything that everybody else
[1:49:12] does. Get your eyes on Jesus and be
[1:49:16] willing.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Who you talking to? You.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; If you be willing
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; and obedient,
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; you'll eat the good of the promise.
[1:49:29] Hallelujah.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; You'll be the promise.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; You'll be the manifestation of the
[1:49:35] promise.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; But if you refuse,
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; if you refuse
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; and rebel, Oh,
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; you shall be devoured with the sword,
[1:49:45] for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken
[1:49:48] it.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; I I want to speak to you for a little
[1:49:53] while this morning on destiny forfeited
[1:49:56] or fulfilled.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; And if I had a subtitle, I would call it
[1:50:01] refusing the scroll.
[1:50:04] I've taught many times on on destiny
[1:50:08] purpose and even scrolls of destiny.
[1:50:13] The ministry of Jesus was such that he
[1:50:18] said about his own ministry, I can do
[1:50:21] nothing
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; except it's revealed to me
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; of my father.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; That doesn't make a trinity.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; It puts a body
[1:50:34] on an eternal spirit.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; Now he's got a body.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Not just a theophony, but now he has a
[1:50:42] body. He's not just a rainbow. He's not
[1:50:45] just a pillar of fire.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; He's not just a uh you know what a
[1:50:50] cloud. Thank you.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; He He has a body.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "I can't do anything of
[1:50:56] my own. I must do what I see him, what I
[1:51:00] hear from him, what is revealed to me
[1:51:03] from him. That's what I must do. And uh
[1:51:06] you might understand that because he's
[1:51:08] he's telling us in a in a slight
[1:51:10] paraphrase here. He's telling us it's by
[1:51:13] vision.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; You might not be familiar with that
[1:51:18] pertaining to the ministry of Jesus, but
[1:51:20] every one of you are familiar with that
[1:51:22] concept pertaining to the ministry of
[1:51:24] brother Brandham. He he operated by
[1:51:27] vision.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; And as long as he was willing
[1:51:35] and obedient,
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; the the vision was fulfilled.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; I told you a few weeks ago the brown
[1:51:44] bear was another story.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; He said God was there.
[1:51:50] He was ready to do what he intended to
[1:51:54] do and
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; we get in the way.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; It's unsanctified mercy.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; Mercy is a wonderful thing. Sanctified.
[1:52:06] It's the right thing. It's the right
[1:52:09] thing to do. Show mercy. But I want you
[1:52:11] to know you can show mercy that is not
[1:52:14] godly mercy. right now.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; Just like some people, anybody who asks,
[1:52:21] you say, "Well, isn't that what the
[1:52:22] Bible said?" Listen, we're living in an
[1:52:24] hour right now where you ought to be
[1:52:26] wise about your alms.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; They'll come up to you at the gas
[1:52:31] station. They'll come up to you at the
[1:52:32] grocery store parking lot. You've got to
[1:52:35] be led by the Holy Ghost.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; And if you're of a of this mindset, uh,
[1:52:40] because you take this verse and you say,
[1:52:43] "Well, uh, if they ask, give." And so if
[1:52:45] if that's your motto, do it. But the
[1:52:48] scripture also says we should be careful
[1:52:50] about putting a bottle to our neighbor's
[1:52:52] mouth
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; when they when they ought to be eating a
[1:52:56] cheeseburger by now.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; And so sometimes we're enabling people
[1:53:01] to continue in the bondage
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; to the demon that has them bound.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God would have to tell me,
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; evidently, he told Brother Vanom, he'd
[1:53:12] have to tell me to buy somebody a pack
[1:53:14] of cigarettes,
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; I don't want to buy somebody's speed. I
[1:53:18] don't want to buy somebody uh all of
[1:53:20] these different kinds of drugs. And I
[1:53:23] don't want to do it. But when the spirit
[1:53:24] of the Lord, oh, we've got to be so in
[1:53:27] tune with him.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; I want to help that one. I want to help
[1:53:31] him deep. I want to help them bigmen.
[1:53:34] But I don't want to just be handing it
[1:53:36] out because I think there someone has
[1:53:38] asked and I'm maybe you should say then
[1:53:41] let me take you here and buy you a sack
[1:53:43] of hamburgers. Let me let me take you
[1:53:45] over here and get you a Dr. Pepper. Uh
[1:53:47] that'll help anything that ails you. Or
[1:53:50] you might what whatever it is that you
[1:53:52] but but be wise as serpents and harmless
[1:53:57] as doves because maybe we're not all
[1:54:00] moving by vision. But brother Brandham
[1:54:02] operated. He was operating by that. And
[1:54:04] Jesus, his own ministry was moved by
[1:54:07] what the father showed him, what he saw,
[1:54:09] what he knew the father wanted to be
[1:54:11] done. Well, if we're becoming one with
[1:54:14] him,
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; come on now.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; It may not be a picture that flashes. It
[1:54:19] may just be a knowing that breaks forth
[1:54:22] in your heart
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; and you say, "Yeah, this is the one I
[1:54:26] want to invest in.
[1:54:28] This is the one. But I and I'll buy this
[1:54:30] one food, but I'm not giving the money
[1:54:32] to go and pay the dealer.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; It's not my responsibility to pay the
[1:54:37] drug debt.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; Come on, folks.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; We got to be led in this hour. Lots of
[1:54:43] wisdom,
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; uh, lots of maturity.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; That means some of us are going to have
[1:54:48] to have great change.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; Cuz we get so upset.
[1:54:55] We remember mama in the floor and that's
[1:54:57] where we go.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; Paralyzed
[1:55:01] in the bed
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; because there's problems. They're going
[1:55:05] to if you if you stay in bed every day
[1:55:08] that there's problems.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; You're going to be stinking. You're
[1:55:15] going to be smelling because you're
[1:55:16] going to be in the bed a long time.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; You and I have to come to a place where
[1:55:20] we say, "Lord, this load is so heavy. I
[1:55:23] I could never carry it by myself. Thanks
[1:55:26] be to God. Thanks be to God. I don't
[1:55:29] have to carry it
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; by myself. Greater is he that is in me
[1:55:36] than he
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Have you ever been depressed? I know
[1:55:39] what depression is. I know what clinical
[1:55:43] diagnosed
[1:55:44] depression and anxiety is. and and and
[1:55:48] so many years ago before they gave a
[1:55:51] pill to everybody who complained about
[1:55:53] stress.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; I I dealt with it when it was still a
[1:56:00] big stigma to have anxiety or to have
[1:56:04] panic attacks. I know what it's like to
[1:56:07] be low, to be down in the dumps or or
[1:56:10] the mlly grubs or the blues or whatever
[1:56:14] you want to call it for no reason even.
[1:56:16] right
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; for no reason even
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; life good wife good children good good
[1:56:23] but it just
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; and you can choose to stay under the
[1:56:29] heaviness of that
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; or you can go the Bible route
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; may take you weeks to get there but
[1:56:36] there's a Bible route hallelujah shake
[1:56:41] off
[1:56:43] those heavy bands hands.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; Sing a new song
[1:56:51] unto the Lord.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Go all over your house talking in
[1:56:57] tongues.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; There's nobody there to judge you.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; And when I decide to do that, I don't
[1:57:06] shut the windows. I'm I I'm like Daniel.
[1:57:09] I'm not ashamed
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; of having to push my way in to the
[1:57:14] presence of God. I'll tell you what's
[1:57:16] wrong with people so often in this hour
[1:57:19] is they'll look you in the face and say,
[1:57:21] "I hate it when people pity me."
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; And I want to say to them sometime, "Oh,
[1:57:28] really?
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, really?"
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; Because from where I'm standing, you
[1:57:35] seem to love pity.
[1:57:38] You remind me of the Pharisees that if
[1:57:40] they're going to fast, they are they
[1:57:42] want the whole world to know they're
[1:57:44] fasting.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; If they got a problem, they want the
[1:57:48] whole world to know they're in the
[1:57:50] despairs.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. You'll learn
[1:57:53] eventually, but it better be quick
[1:57:56] because you're being called on to be
[1:57:59] willing
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; and obedient. If if there's any tone, if
[1:58:03] you sense a tone in me this morning that
[1:58:06] would make you think that I am uh not uh
[1:58:09] legitimizing, I am legitimizing all of
[1:58:13] your anxiety and your stress and your
[1:58:16] heartache and your burden and your
[1:58:19] emotion and your depression and your
[1:58:22] heaviness. It's so it's real. It's not a
[1:58:25] fantasy.
[1:58:29] But what I can't do
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; is celebrate it.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; You don't need somebody else to
[1:58:38] celebrate it.
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; You need somebody else to show you how
[1:58:43] to get out of it.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; This is the road map out.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; You'll stay there as long as you're
[1:58:52] trying to figure out how to change
[1:58:54] people around you.
[1:58:56] You'll stay depressed.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; You'll stay in that. But once you make
[1:59:01] up your mind, I don't care. I can't
[1:59:03] help. I can't help that. I can't help
[1:59:05] that. I can't do that. I don't know how
[1:59:08] to fix that. But I've got to get myself
[1:59:10] up out of the valley of despair. I've
[1:59:13] got to pull myself up.
[1:59:17] There's a king in my castle
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; who says it's time to rule and reign
[1:59:26] with authority in your life.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; Woo.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to forfeit anything that
[1:59:36] belongs to me.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; Today
[1:59:44] is the seventh
[1:59:46] of September
[1:59:48] 2025.
[1:59:50] Tomorrow
[1:59:52] will be 35 years ago. My life changed
[1:59:56] forever.
[1:59:59] My precious grandmother,
[2:00:03] who I loved dearly,
[2:00:05] who had been there for me always,
[2:00:10] took her last breath 35 years ago
[2:00:14] tomorrow, and it changed everything.
[2:00:17] There was no big mama
[2:00:24] to pull me up, to pack me out,
[2:00:28] to help me out.
[2:00:32] I've told you enough about her to tell
[2:00:34] you that
[2:00:36] just a year before she passed, m maybe
[2:00:38] not even a year, the motor on the o on
[2:00:42] the vehicle I drove blew up,
[2:00:45] left me stranded on the side of the road
[2:00:47] coming here. There was no money.
[2:00:51] There was no money.
[2:00:54] There was gas money. What good did the
[2:00:57] did a tank of gas do when I had to leave
[2:01:00] it behind me on the side of the road?
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; I didn't know what I would do. I didn't
[2:01:05] know how I'd get back to South Carolina.
[2:01:07] We hadn't uh hadn't closed the church
[2:01:10] there. And uh I didn't know what I would
[2:01:14] do. And a and a dear sister who was
[2:01:16] helping take care of my grandmother, she
[2:01:18] came to me one day. She said, "Steve,"
[2:01:20] and she could do that because we were
[2:01:22] that close. She said, "Steve," she knew
[2:01:25] me all my life. She said, "I want to I
[2:01:28] want to loan you the money."
[2:01:31] She said, "No terms, no interest. I want
[2:01:34] to loan you the money and my husband
[2:01:36] knows a mechanic and we're going to get
[2:01:37] the motor rebuilt or or whatever we have
[2:01:40] to do. It doesn't matter what it cost.
[2:01:43] We're not going to leave you stranded
[2:01:44] here." But she said, "It's just a it's
[2:01:46] just a loan." And I knew I knew I'd been
[2:01:49] in her home.
[2:01:52] I knew that they didn't have new
[2:01:56] furniture.
[2:01:59] They had dirty wood floors. When I say
[2:02:02] that, I mean they weren't refinished.
[2:02:04] They were the original deal.
[2:02:08] They weren't pretty.
[2:02:10] The chair was threadbear and the couch
[2:02:13] had so many quilts thrown over it to
[2:02:17] cover the springs.
[2:02:19] And they were just happy. They they her
[2:02:22] own automobile was 20 years old.
[2:02:27] They hadn't I didn't know how in the
[2:02:28] world they'd come up with that amount of
[2:02:30] money, but she'd give me that money and
[2:02:31] I was able to with her husband's help to
[2:02:34] get the motor taken care of so I could
[2:02:36] get back to South Carolina. And 35 years
[2:02:39] ago tomorrow when my grandmother drew
[2:02:42] her last breath, that little sister was
[2:02:45] there and she walked over to me. She I
[2:02:47] was kneeling down beside my granny and
[2:02:50] she come behind me and grabbed me like
[2:02:53] from behind, wrapped her arms around me
[2:02:55] and whispered in my ear
[2:02:58] and she said, "Honey, you don't owe us
[2:03:01] that money. It wasn't our money.
[2:03:05] We didn't loan you that money."
[2:03:09] I said, "What do you mean?" She said,
[2:03:10] "Your grandmother gave you that money,
[2:03:13] but she didn't want you to know that it
[2:03:15] was from her." Because she wanted you to
[2:03:19] always remember, even when she wasn't
[2:03:22] here,
[2:03:23] that he would be your source.
[2:03:28] In the moment that you start looking to
[2:03:31] people
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; as your source
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; expecting them to always rescue you.
[2:03:41] You have left the privilege
[2:03:45] of having confidence and faith in a
[2:03:50] mighty God
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; who can meet your need if he has to do
[2:03:55] it under a piece of trash on the side of
[2:03:57] the road. The wind blow and expose the
[2:04:02] money laying there
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; that you have need of. She had taught me
[2:04:07] that my life. Don't look to people.
[2:04:11] Don't look to offerings. Don't look to
[2:04:13] churches.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; You look to God.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; He will meet your need.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; He will take care of you.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; How many of you have proven him?
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; And you know,
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; granny used to say, "Pay it'll come."
[2:04:35] It doesn't always come on Friday or the
[2:04:37] third of the month.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; But God's got a payday.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; He's got a record kept.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; Don't look to one another for your needs
[2:04:49] to be met.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; Look to the master.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; He may use. It's our privilege. It's
[2:04:57] part of Isaiah 1. Lord, may we be
[2:05:01] responsible enough
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; to render justice
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; to the widow
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; and to the fatherless
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; to those who have real need.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; May we be sensitive,
[2:05:19] but as people of God, may we not look to
[2:05:21] each other
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; with some sense of expectation. And that
[2:05:25] because I'm telling you, sometimes
[2:05:27] people are slow and they may not get
[2:05:29] what you're trying to do. A and they may
[2:05:32] not meet your need and you may be
[2:05:33] disappointed and you may lose confidence
[2:05:35] in them and you may stumble even in your
[2:05:38] faith toward God. But if you'll go
[2:05:40] straight to the source every time,
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; hello.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; He will take care of us.
[2:05:49] forfeite,
[2:05:51] destiny forfeited or fulfilled. We've
[2:05:55] talked about the books of heaven. The
[2:05:57] Bible's clear. There's not just one
[2:05:59] book. There are multiple books. Uh that
[2:06:03] in fact we understand by following all
[2:06:06] the quotes.
[2:06:08] We've had ministers to come and preach
[2:06:10] here. totally sincere, wonderful,
[2:06:15] precious brothers who would preach to us
[2:06:19] from one set of quotes telling us that
[2:06:22] the book of life and the lamb's book of
[2:06:24] life are the same book.
[2:06:27] It's just all all they read. It's it's
[2:06:30] perhaps what they heard. But you'll
[2:06:33] never I don't care what they say. You'll
[2:06:35] never be able to get the full picture
[2:06:38] by looking at one or two just isolated
[2:06:41] little quotes over here.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; And if you think that 63 rule will will
[2:06:46] be a solve all, it won't.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; Some people say if you really want to
[2:06:52] know what the message is and you look
[2:06:53] after 63. Oh,
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; that won't work every time. That may
[2:06:58] work sometime. That won't work every
[2:07:00] time.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; No. because even between 63 and 65,
[2:07:05] whether it was by a slip of the tongue,
[2:07:07] I don't know. But he reverted a time or
[2:07:09] two back to something that he had said
[2:07:11] previously. Why do you think that is,
[2:07:14] but I I don't know for sure. I'm not I'm
[2:07:16] not uh you know in on all the detail,
[2:07:19] but what I what I think I'll tell you as
[2:07:22] a thought, not a doctrine. I think that
[2:07:25] God allows things sometime to happen so
[2:07:28] that you and I will take what we hear,
[2:07:31] what we what we feed on, what we
[2:07:34] respect, but we will always take it back
[2:07:37] to the word and and see what dove tales
[2:07:41] and we don't have to condemn the rest by
[2:07:44] any means, but we don't build our life
[2:07:46] on something that doesn't line up right
[2:07:49] to the letter of the word. May the
[2:07:52] spirit of Bereans fall upon all of us.
[2:07:56] And may we look at all the things he
[2:07:58] said. If we're studying a subject
[2:08:00] according to the message, may we look at
[2:08:02] all the things he said.
[2:08:06] And
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; and uh so we know there was a there's a
[2:08:09] lamb's book of life. And there's a book
[2:08:11] of life. And in the lamb's book of life,
[2:08:14] your name cannot be erased out of the
[2:08:18] lamb's book of life. He said your name
[2:08:21] was there from before the foundation of
[2:08:23] the world
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; and it cannot be blotted out.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; But there's a book of life
[2:08:31] and there there is the possibility of
[2:08:33] names being blotted out of the book of
[2:08:35] life. Those who ultimately reject God's
[2:08:38] plan for help and hope and salvation.
[2:08:41] And it is as though in the in the
[2:08:43] oracles and records of eternity, it is
[2:08:46] as though that person never existed.
[2:08:49] I don't know if that strikes you heavy
[2:08:51] or not.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; That strikes me pretty heavy. If your
[2:08:55] name is blotted out of the book of life,
[2:08:57] you didn't exist.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; It is as though you never showed up in
[2:09:02] on the planet. And it does happen. The
[2:09:06] scriptures are clear. But there are
[2:09:08] other books the Bible talks about.
[2:09:11] There's a book that is kept it. It
[2:09:14] records
[2:09:16] those who meet together.
[2:09:19] in the name of the Lord.
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; Those who meet often and speak of these
[2:09:24] things, there's a record. There's a book
[2:09:26] kept. Now, since there were no books in
[2:09:29] the times of the Bible, we say scrolls
[2:09:32] because that's how everything was was
[2:09:34] kept. And that's when we when we hear of
[2:09:38] the open book, we're blessed because
[2:09:40] that's what our Bible says. But books
[2:09:43] were not invented when John was on the
[2:09:45] aisle of Patmas.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; Interesting, isn't it? There weren't
[2:09:49] even books.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; It was a scroll and it was sealed with
[2:09:53] seals. And I like the picture of that
[2:09:56] because when God deals with me about
[2:09:58] destinies, he often deals with me and
[2:10:01] that kind of picture scrolls.
[2:10:04] And on August 23rd,
[2:10:08] I had this experience
[2:10:10] and I'm going to read you what I shared
[2:10:14] with you spontaneously that morning if
[2:10:17] you don't mind. Uh I don't mean to quote
[2:10:21] myself as though that was some brother
[2:10:23] Green used to say when they when they
[2:10:26] start quoting you, you've arrived.
[2:10:29] And I said, "What if you quote
[2:10:30] yourself?" He said, "Well, I'm not going
[2:10:32] there." So,
[2:10:34] and then in the next breath he'd say,
[2:10:36] you know, I'm an I'm an icon. He said,
[2:10:39] "They say I'm an icon in the message."
[2:10:43] And he would kind of laugh about it. But
[2:10:44] I could tell that after all he'd been
[2:10:46] through, he was just glad that somebody
[2:10:49] said something nice.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; And when when they say icon in that
[2:10:53] term, they mean a they mean a fixture.
[2:10:56] They mean they mean something that is
[2:10:58] predominant, something that is there or
[2:11:00] there and as much a part of it as
[2:11:02] anything, not some icon to worship.
[2:11:06] But anyway, I'm I'm reading you sang
[2:11:09] about it today. Now on the pathway, the
[2:11:12] wine press falls heavy, but it's
[2:11:15] bringing forth only the best of the
[2:11:17] wine. Would you choose any other way?
[2:11:21] Wouldn't you want to be the best of the
[2:11:24] best? And the only way to do that might
[2:11:28] be I tell you it is through submission.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; Remember the rest of this verse. I
[2:11:36] believe the verse continues with so into
[2:11:38] submission to him.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; I surrender this day. And that's a
[2:11:44] significant thing. It's a big step to
[2:11:46] agree to. There are certain things that
[2:11:49] you agreed to before you arrived here
[2:11:55] and there are some things you'll agree
[2:11:57] to now if you want to move forward in
[2:12:00] him.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; Remember the the the the invitation is
[2:12:06] if
[2:12:07] if you be willing and obedient.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; So there are things that you'll agree to
[2:12:14] now if you want to move forward in him.
[2:12:16] Are you here? Amen.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; And I saw mantels
[2:12:20] because sometimes in in
[2:12:24] dreams or visions or experiences
[2:12:28] you see clothes,
[2:12:31] cloaks,
[2:12:34] uh pieces of material like the girdle
[2:12:39] that is wrapped around as we mentioned
[2:12:42] last week to tuck the ends of the robe
[2:12:45] into for running, girding up your loins.
[2:12:49] Sometimes you'll see things like that in
[2:12:51] dreams or visions and it represents
[2:12:55] callings or anointings. And we know that
[2:12:58] from scripture and I already mentioned
[2:12:59] that because Elisha
[2:13:03] refused to let Elijah get out of his
[2:13:05] sight.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; And when he goes up, the mantle comes
[2:13:08] down. He grabs that mantle and goes out
[2:13:11] over the water, wraps it around his arm,
[2:13:13] does exactly like he saw his master do.
[2:13:15] Are you sure you're here?
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; Well, you just said that. Yeah. Want you
[2:13:19] to hear it again. And he smoked the
[2:13:22] water. Pow.
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; Where is the Lord God
[2:13:28] of?
[2:13:31] Oh, they love that. They love that
[2:13:33] around the message. They love saying
[2:13:35] that. It's all right. Scripture. I like
[2:13:39] it, too.
[2:13:41] But that's not the point for you and I.
[2:13:46] We shouldn't have to be saying, "Where
[2:13:48] is the Lord God of Elijah?
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; Where is the Lord God of William
[2:13:52] Brandom?"
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; We ought to have come to a place of
[2:13:55] maturity and adoption. And if God's
[2:13:57] calling us, we ought to be able to wrap
[2:13:59] that mantel around our arm and call on
[2:14:01] the name of God for ourselves.
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; Where is my God? God, I need you to
[2:14:08] come.
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry if that offends you. That's
[2:14:13] just my thought here. You you don't you
[2:14:15] don't have to always put some something
[2:14:17] to it and attach something extra to it.
[2:14:20] You you you like he said, make sure all
[2:14:22] the dead cats are off the line and you
[2:14:24] can call on Jesus anytime.
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; But but of course this was powerful
[2:14:31] because this was the mantle.
[2:14:34] We're not looking for the mantle
[2:14:36] particularly of brother Brandham because
[2:14:38] he came with a commission that there
[2:14:40] were seven to come and seven hath come
[2:14:42] and and uh now it's a bride time
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; and there's more than seven of us
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; and we ought to be grabbing up whatever
[2:14:51] mantle God sends down whatever anointing
[2:14:54] he wants to put on you.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; Well, how do we know there are even
[2:14:58] different kinds of anointing? The
[2:14:59] prophet told us. He told us, he
[2:15:03] described what the anointing of Elijah
[2:15:05] was like.
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; Well, that wasn't like the anointing of
[2:15:07] every other prophet.
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; They all had different a and and
[2:15:11] servants of the Lord and the apostles
[2:15:13] and the disciples. They they had
[2:15:16] different callings and commissionings.
[2:15:17] They were sent to different kinds of
[2:15:19] people. They ministered in different
[2:15:22] kinds of ways because God isn't stuck in
[2:15:25] a box.
[2:15:27] He's a God of variety.
[2:15:30] &gt;&gt; Isn't he?
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, are you? You are.
[2:15:34] &gt;&gt; And I saw mantels and anointings. I saw
[2:15:37] scrolls
[2:15:39] filled with revelation. And as soon as
[2:15:41] you say that, there's a lot of folks out
[2:15:43] there, oh yeah, that's too charismatic
[2:15:45] for me.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; No, no, it's too biblical.
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; Because what? Instead of doing what he
[2:15:54] told us to do and checking out something
[2:15:56] first by the word, you do the search on
[2:15:59] the message computer system and you want
[2:16:02] to see if brother Brandham said anything
[2:16:03] about it to make sure that it's right.
[2:16:06] What about doing a Bible search?
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; What about an oldfashioned Strongs
[2:16:10] concordance?
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; This isn't reflecting negative on
[2:16:16] brother Brandham in any means at all. It
[2:16:18] just means that that's the this is the
[2:16:20] foundation. go right to the foundation.
[2:16:23] Uh I don't want to call names and get
[2:16:25] other people in trouble, but because
[2:16:27] maybe he has a different thought now
[2:16:29] than he had back then, but in in in in
[2:16:33] over 35 years ago when brother Henry
[2:16:36] Simmons and brother Isaiah Brooks, who
[2:16:39] were ministering in South Carolina,
[2:16:42] Brother Henry is still there. Brother
[2:16:44] Brooks is in Idaho and I just heard from
[2:16:47] him this week and he's inviting us to
[2:16:49] come out and speak for him again, but he
[2:16:52] came and not that I've been before, but
[2:16:55] that he's invited us before and uh would
[2:16:58] love to go very much. They came to where
[2:17:01] I was living in Anderson, South
[2:17:03] Carolina, and they they just can we help
[2:17:05] you? Can we answer questions? Can we
[2:17:08] give you material? We've heard that you
[2:17:10] have uh come across this great message
[2:17:12] and we want to be there and available
[2:17:14] and you know that's just that's just
[2:17:16] right.
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; Seems like anymore if you hear that
[2:17:21] somebody else has come to a higher place
[2:17:23] of truth. Ah let's see if it last.
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; Let's see if they've got enough strength
[2:17:29] to come out of that denomination. But I
[2:17:31] so appreciated the attitude of those two
[2:17:34] brothers. They came. They didn't know
[2:17:35] me. They came. They drove several hours
[2:17:38] to get to me and we spent the day
[2:17:40] together. I loved it. I appreciated it.
[2:17:44] They began to to invite me to preach for
[2:17:46] them there in South Carolina and I did
[2:17:48] for for several years. And then Brother
[2:17:51] Brooks went on to Ohio and I preached
[2:17:54] for him several times there in Ohio
[2:17:58] and appreciate their their life. Brother
[2:18:00] Henry Simmons said to me not too long
[2:18:02] after we met, he said, "Now, if you want
[2:18:05] to keep the anointing that you have on
[2:18:07] your ministry," he said, "Here's the way
[2:18:09] to do it. When God talks to your heart,"
[2:18:12] he said, "you go back to the word.
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; You find it in the book."
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:18:19] He said, 'Now don't you go straight to
[2:18:21] the quotes
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; because if you do, you'll lose the
[2:18:26] anointing that's on your life and you'll
[2:18:29] be an intellectual polyarrot.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; You'll just be repeating it like the
[2:18:34] like the like the disciples there in the
[2:18:36] scripture, you know, uh in the name of
[2:18:39] of the of the one that Paul preached
[2:18:41] about.
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; Come out. And that didn't work too good.
[2:18:47] The demon screamed out, you know, Paul,
[2:18:49] I know Jesus. I Who in the world are
[2:18:51] you?
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; You lose your own call and commission
[2:18:54] sometime if you don't do what you were
[2:18:56] always doing. He said, isn't that what
[2:18:58] you did before? You took you felt
[2:18:59] something, saw something, heard
[2:19:01] something, experienced something. Didn't
[2:19:03] you always go back to the word? Yes,
[2:19:04] sir. Absolutely. 100%. And he said, "If
[2:19:06] I were you, I'd keep doing that
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; and then
[2:19:10] then I would search the message because
[2:19:12] if you found it in there, it's very
[2:19:16] likely
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; now
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; that you'll find it over here."
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; Now, somebody here may resent that kind
[2:19:22] of advice, but it anchored me. I wish
[2:19:25] they were giving that kind of advice
[2:19:27] today
[2:19:28] &gt;&gt; because some people think that they can
[2:19:30] use the quotes just like just like some
[2:19:33] kind of magic potion or something and
[2:19:36] it's going to have the same authority
[2:19:38] and the same power. No, no, no, no. It's
[2:19:40] the life behind the name
[2:19:44] that makes the demons tremble.
[2:19:50] It's the life behind the name that makes
[2:19:54] the proud heart humble.
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; It was God who devised the plan that in
[2:20:02] all things as a man he would live so he
[2:20:07] could give watch. Give us give us
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; give us
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; the life behind the name.
[2:20:18] Yes, sir.
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; Quoting the newspaper doesn't make you a
[2:20:22] journalist.
[2:20:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:26] &gt;&gt; Because you have a car in your garage
[2:20:28] doesn't make you a mechanic.
[2:20:31] &gt;&gt; Because you can find a quote doesn't
[2:20:33] make you called.
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; I loved that advice.
[2:20:40] Where was I?
[2:20:42] I saw uh scrolls filled with
[2:20:45] revelations, interpretations,
[2:20:47] understandings. I saw the callings of
[2:20:49] the Lord last night and a and I saw so
[2:20:52] much more. It was the burdens of the
[2:20:54] Lord. It was the zeal for the house of
[2:20:58] the Lord. I saw prophetic decrees and
[2:21:00] prophetic acts of demonstration
[2:21:04] that pass right by many people. I knew
[2:21:09] saints from New Hope, even family
[2:21:12] members who never even tried to catch or
[2:21:17] embrace
[2:21:19] these oilfilled assignments
[2:21:22] of the Lord.
[2:21:25] I saw some only half-heartedly making
[2:21:27] weak attempts
[2:21:32] to grab
[2:21:34] weak attempts
[2:21:36] to catch
[2:21:38] or embrace
[2:21:43] things of their own choosing.
[2:21:49] I literally saw people
[2:21:53] examining destiny assignments,
[2:21:58] the perfect plans of God,
[2:22:01] things that God has ordained his bride
[2:22:05] to do.
[2:22:07] And I saw people
[2:22:09] burning brain cells
[2:22:12] trying to decide
[2:22:15] if that is something that they would be
[2:22:18] willing
[2:22:19] to take and carry out. If
[2:22:23] you be willing
[2:22:26] &gt;&gt; and obedient,
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; you shall eat the good of the land.
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; I know you're tired.
[2:22:34] I saw some half-hearted attempts. At
[2:22:37] times, it seemed that a a few people
[2:22:39] were only reaching for things that might
[2:22:42] make them more noticed
[2:22:45] or bring more public attention and glory
[2:22:48] for themselves, while deeper, weightier
[2:22:52] assignments would pass by them without
[2:22:55] any effort at all to claim them. What I
[2:22:58] didn't tell you, but it's in my notes.
[2:23:01] What I didn't tell you was I actually
[2:23:03] saw people bargaining
[2:23:06] like a like a like a yard sale.
[2:23:10] Bargaining. Could I trade this in? I saw
[2:23:14] it in the bed in the night.
[2:23:20] I saw a person
[2:23:23] who was holding out
[2:23:26] waiting
[2:23:28] and someone asked him, "What are you
[2:23:31] waiting for?" It was a pullpit ministry
[2:23:34] that he was waiting for.
[2:23:37] And while he was waiting on a pull pit
[2:23:40] ministry
[2:23:42] weighty
[2:23:44] assignments of deliverance and hope and
[2:23:47] help and encouragement,
[2:23:52] who in the world would want to trade a
[2:23:55] fiery revival
[2:23:58] to go down to a black unic
[2:24:06] on the side of a road, foreign country,
[2:24:10] the treasurer of Candace, the Queen of
[2:24:12] Ethiopia.
[2:24:14] Who would want to give up a public
[2:24:16] revival that the that the people were ab
[2:24:19] a blaze and the news was spreading
[2:24:22] across the land in the book of Acts? Who
[2:24:25] would be willing to be caught away from
[2:24:28] a from a pedestal moment, a spotlight
[2:24:31] moment to go down and find one?
[2:24:41] Philip was willing.
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; He had a little help getting there.
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; But he was willing.
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; There are no cessationists in this
[2:24:52] church that I know of. And if they are,
[2:24:54] I wonder how in the world you stumbled
[2:24:56] in here because we don't believe your
[2:24:59] dirty rotten doctrine that God only did
[2:25:02] these supernatural wonders in the times
[2:25:05] of the early church. In fact, we believe
[2:25:08] that everything God did in all the other
[2:25:10] church ages, he still has power and
[2:25:12] authority to do even in our day. Amen.
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; And if someone traveled by means of the
[2:25:19] spirit then
[2:25:20] &gt;&gt; then we still believe that if God were a
[2:25:23] mind to
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; he could catch somebody away today
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; and he has
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; and he will and he can.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; Like the prophet said about angels, we
[2:25:36] just we need people to believe in them.
[2:25:39] Y
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; we know people talk about them and then
[2:25:42] they start coming and we become aware
[2:25:44] that they're there among us.
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; We're not worshiping them th those
[2:25:48] angels or looking to them as our answer.
[2:25:50] But I tell you, I appreciate the fact
[2:25:53] &gt;&gt; that there's more for us
[2:25:56] &gt;&gt; that we can't see
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; than the ones who are against us that we
[2:26:00] do see. Sometime my biggest uh support
[2:26:04] comes from another realm. Aren't you
[2:26:07] glad we've got that with us? Praise God.
[2:26:10] I saw some who let important destiny
[2:26:14] assignments
[2:26:18] trickle
[2:26:22] float like this by them while they were
[2:26:27] examining,
[2:26:29] waiting, and looking for an opportunity
[2:26:32] to have a pullpit call.
[2:26:35] May I just tell you that if that is your
[2:26:38] ambition and it's not God's design for
[2:26:41] your life, you're wasting your time
[2:26:43] holding out for that.
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; You'd be more in the way than you would
[2:26:48] be anything else.
[2:26:53] It always seems to be so desirable to
[2:26:57] those who have never had that burden or
[2:26:59] responsibility. But you give it to them
[2:27:01] a while and maybe they would rather be
[2:27:04] the janitor of the church than then st
[2:27:07] come on now because just remember some
[2:27:10] of the same ones that are shouting on
[2:27:12] Sunday morning, hosana pastor. Praise
[2:27:15] the Lord. Hosanna pastor. Amen. Woo.
[2:27:18] Glory to God. God's man of power is in
[2:27:21] the house.
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; By next weekend, they're crying,
[2:27:26] "Crucify him!"
[2:27:29] &gt;&gt; People are fickle. Don't get your eyes
[2:27:33] on a ministry because it's in the
[2:27:35] spotlight. Right.
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; If you want to have that kind of a
[2:27:39] position, do like Seymour did and hang
[2:27:42] your head in an apple crate,
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; in an orange crate,
[2:27:48] &gt;&gt; and pray quietly on the platform,
[2:27:51] believing that God will have his will
[2:27:53] and way. If he can't trust you with
[2:27:56] little things, how could he trust you
[2:27:58] with big things? I saw people
[2:28:03] reaching to take something that they had
[2:28:05] already accepted
[2:28:07] and wanted to trade it.
[2:28:12] &gt;&gt; It's selfish ambition.
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you something, that one
[2:28:18] little Ethiopian unic who was out there
[2:28:20] in that chariot,
[2:28:22] &gt;&gt; he was responsible for a move of God
[2:28:24] striking a nation. Amen.
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; And it must have been prophetic because
[2:28:29] if you go to Jerusalem today, you'll see
[2:28:32] tens of thousands of Ethiopians
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; who live in Israel by making aliyah by
[2:28:40] the right of return because they are
[2:28:43] part of of they're Jews. They they
[2:28:47] converted.
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:28:49] &gt;&gt; Because of the witness,
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; but they're really believers in Jesus
[2:28:53] Yeshua, the Messiah. and they have to
[2:28:56] live a Jewish life, even a kippa on
[2:28:58] their head because the only way to get
[2:29:00] out of the of the war and poverty years
[2:29:02] ago on uh Ethiopia was to come out on
[2:29:06] planes and and and in order to do that
[2:29:09] and be accepted in Israel, they had to
[2:29:11] claim their Jewishness, which was
[2:29:13] granted to them after many years of
[2:29:15] fighting in the laws and in the courts.
[2:29:17] And once it did, let me tell you, those
[2:29:19] big jumbo jets went in there and brought
[2:29:22] those Ethiopian Jews out, secret
[2:29:25] believers.
[2:29:28] &gt;&gt; God.
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; How do you know? Because when we go to
[2:29:34] the marketplace, when we go in public in
[2:29:37] Jerusalem and in Israel, there'll be,
[2:29:40] you know, many Jewish people will maybe
[2:29:42] nod their head or greet us. Oh no. When
[2:29:46] you come to the Ethiopians, they show
[2:29:48] all of their snow white teeth.
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:29:53] &gt;&gt; They grin. They smile. They
[2:29:58] poke you in the rib.
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. They want you to know I know what
[2:30:03] you are and I am also that
[2:30:08] living here in the land.
[2:30:12] Because the word of the Lord, the spirit
[2:30:16] of God caught a an apostle away, put him
[2:30:19] down there. Understand thou what thou
[2:30:22] readest? He said, I don't have a clue.
[2:30:25] How could I understand except somebody
[2:30:28] teach me? And you know what? I I if it
[2:30:32] was offered perhaps to some of those in
[2:30:34] my experience, maybe they would have
[2:30:36] seen that one little man
[2:30:39] &gt;&gt; and they would have said, "I'd rather
[2:30:40] have a a public place. I'd rather have a
[2:30:43] celebrated ministry than that. And I
[2:30:46] I'll I'll trade you my Ethiopian unic
[2:30:54] for an opportunity to be called a
[2:30:56] preacher again.
[2:31:00] It broke. It broke me.
[2:31:05] Would it be sacrilegious to say it
[2:31:07] gutted me? It felt like a spear.
[2:31:14] Have we not come farther than that in
[2:31:18] this last day army
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; that we would reject an assignment of
[2:31:24] any kind? I don't care what it is. If
[2:31:27] God wants me to have it,
[2:31:31] I started to tell you earlier when my
[2:31:33] grandmother passed away, there were
[2:31:34] things that she wanted each of us to
[2:31:36] have and the family started fighting
[2:31:39] immediately
[2:31:42] and they were baffled because there were
[2:31:45] things that were not assigned to anybody
[2:31:47] and and they didn't understand why I
[2:31:49] wasn't jumping for those.
[2:31:53] And I explained to them, I only want
[2:31:56] what she wanted me to have.
[2:31:59] &gt;&gt; If she didn't want me to particularly
[2:32:02] have it, I don't care who gets it. Get
[2:32:04] it. Take it. Enjoy it. However,
[2:32:09] &gt;&gt; I looked at my uncle and I said,
[2:32:12] "However, if she wrote on that paper
[2:32:14] that she wanted me to have it, get your
[2:32:17] hands off of it." And he laughed because
[2:32:21] he knew I was serious.
[2:32:23] I just felt strongly. All I want is is
[2:32:26] the inheritance that was to be mine. I
[2:32:29] don't want yours.
[2:32:31] &gt;&gt; I I don't want his. I don't want hers.
[2:32:35] But if I know my big mama wanted me to
[2:32:37] have it, I want it. And that's all.
[2:32:39] That's all. That's all there is to it.
[2:32:40] And And so everything went very smooth.
[2:32:43] Very smooth. Mostly smooth. Mostly
[2:32:47] smooth. because someone discovered that
[2:32:49] my Lincoln Town Car was probably more
[2:32:51] valuable than what they got.
[2:32:55] That freezer or that or that uh, you
[2:32:57] know, chest of drawers they were
[2:32:59] fighting for, they they weren't too
[2:33:02] happy when they kept reading.
[2:33:04] Didn't seem as uh beneficial as a paid
[2:33:06] for Lincoln Town Car, did it? But, uh,
[2:33:09] anyway, I didn't need it particularly.
[2:33:11] Well, I kind of did, but I didn't have
[2:33:14] to have a Lincoln. But I wanted it
[2:33:16] because she wanted me to have it.
[2:33:20] &gt;&gt; You ought to be so.
[2:33:22] &gt;&gt; You ought to be so.
[2:33:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:33:24] &gt;&gt; I don't have to do anything that I'm not
[2:33:27] supposed to do. But if I know that Holy
[2:33:29] Ghost, if I know that Jesus wants me to
[2:33:32] do it, I'm not going to stand here and
[2:33:34] bargain and try to trade my destiny
[2:33:37] scroll, my holy assignment in for
[2:33:40] somebody else's
[2:33:42] &gt;&gt; who I want to be like. That's right.
[2:33:45] &gt;&gt; I don't care. You tell them I said so. I
[2:33:47] don't care how many belt buckles they
[2:33:48] wear.
[2:33:49] &gt;&gt; I don't care how many bolo ties they
[2:33:52] wear, how many cowboy hats they wear,
[2:33:54] how many horses they ride.
[2:33:56] &gt;&gt; They'll never be him.
[2:34:01] &gt;&gt; They may imitate the prophet, but
[2:34:03] they'll never be him.
[2:34:05] &gt;&gt; That wasn't their assignment.
[2:34:07] &gt;&gt; Just be your be your assignment. Just be
[2:34:10] what God called you to be and quit
[2:34:12] forfeiting.
[2:34:13] I got to hurry cuz I'm just I'm just I'm
[2:34:16] just off now. I got to come back because
[2:34:18] it's time to go and and and I haven't
[2:34:20] said lot
[2:34:23] &gt;&gt; even after noticing listen they they
[2:34:25] they started reaching for uh glory
[2:34:29] things that seem more glorious while
[2:34:31] deeper weightier assignments would pass
[2:34:33] by them without any effort at all to
[2:34:34] claim them. I saw a few individuals who
[2:34:36] even after noticing their own name
[2:34:40] on the assignment
[2:34:43] on a tag, what looked like a tag, pull
[2:34:45] back almost in disgust.
[2:34:48] You were here when I read when I spoke
[2:34:50] this, weren't you?
[2:34:51] &gt;&gt; At the nature of the mission and all the
[2:34:54] excuses I heard. I could hear individual
[2:34:56] voices of both men and women explaining
[2:34:58] to invisible invisible listeners the
[2:35:01] many reasons why they were would be
[2:35:03] unable to fulfill that specific
[2:35:05] assignment.
[2:35:07] I heard people even going back to their
[2:35:09] childhood back to their generation ago
[2:35:11] and explaining with excuses of why they
[2:35:14] would never be able to do a certain
[2:35:16] thing because you know I was brought up
[2:35:17] a certain way and you know what happened
[2:35:19] and you know how this happened and you
[2:35:20] know how this went. Oh God have mercy.
[2:35:25] You're you're you're living in the past.
[2:35:29] &gt;&gt; Live in the present.
[2:35:31] &gt;&gt; You can do anything God wants you to do.
[2:35:38] &gt;&gt; I I saw I saw uh
[2:35:42] I and excuses and I saw misplaced hunger
[2:35:46] and thirst. There was so much of it. I
[2:35:48] saw many people uninterested,
[2:35:50] distracted, procrastinating with their
[2:35:52] preparations. prayers left unpayed,
[2:35:55] meals unfasted, it was slackness, it was
[2:35:58] slumber, it was unconcerned. And I don't
[2:36:01] know how to say this exactly, but
[2:36:03] according to scripture, we come here
[2:36:04] with a purpose and a predetermined
[2:36:06] destiny. I believe we can fall out of
[2:36:08] God's perfect will. But just to lay a
[2:36:10] foundation here, we can drift into a
[2:36:11] permissive will. And when we come back
[2:36:13] to the perfect will, we pray that God
[2:36:15] will redeem the time and that anything
[2:36:17] we miss while we were cold and different
[2:36:19] and backsliding or whatever you do or
[2:36:22] whatever you want to call it, encumbered
[2:36:24] by snares and troubles of life. We're
[2:36:26] always believing that God will redeem
[2:36:27] that and restore it to us. But I saw
[2:36:29] something in the night and I don't know
[2:36:31] where to place it. I'm not sure exactly
[2:36:33] how to theologically place it because I
[2:36:35] saw that there were things that God
[2:36:37] intended to accomplish, things he
[2:36:39] wanted, things he desired to do through
[2:36:41] our lives, but I saw them filtering down
[2:36:45] like trickling down to other people
[2:36:48] because many have not been willing.
[2:36:52] &gt;&gt; We can't even be faithful to church.
[2:36:57] &gt;&gt; We're going to win nations. We're going
[2:36:59] to have effect. We're going to we're
[2:37:00] going to cast the devils out. We're
[2:37:02] going to heal the sick at Walmart.
[2:37:06] We can't even press through our own
[2:37:08] infirmity.
[2:37:10] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:37:12] ouch.
[2:37:14] &gt;&gt; That went over like a lead balloon,
[2:37:16] didn't it?
[2:37:17] &gt;&gt; But I You just have to You just have to
[2:37:20] experience this. You experience this and
[2:37:23] you'd call it exactly like I'm calling
[2:37:25] it. Right. Right.
[2:37:30] filtering down. I've always sort of in
[2:37:31] my mind, well, then it's just held in
[2:37:33] reserve for us until we get ready to
[2:37:35] come back and obey God and his perfect
[2:37:37] will. But that is not what I saw in the
[2:37:39] night. What I saw was it was nearly it
[2:37:41] was bypassing.
[2:37:43] &gt;&gt; I said, how horrible, how tragic that
[2:37:45] these promises would bypass some, but it
[2:37:48] was trickling down to others. And I saw
[2:37:50] that and I asked, you know, I prayed
[2:37:51] into it. I'm stumbling telling it
[2:37:53] because I want to be careful how I say
[2:37:55] it. But God put a piece in my heart and
[2:37:57] he let me know that there's a remedy for
[2:37:59] that and there's a prevention for that.
[2:38:01] And that is if we all just get willing
[2:38:03] as fast as we can. If ye be willing.
[2:38:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:38:10] &gt;&gt; Ready to submit to him as fast as we can
[2:38:12] because I I I don't I don't mind you
[2:38:14] getting good things from God. I don't
[2:38:15] mind you doing some of the things that
[2:38:17] I'm called to do, but I want mine.
[2:38:20] I'm not jealous over what he's called
[2:38:22] you to do or what he wants you to do.
[2:38:23] But what he wants me to do, I want to do
[2:38:26] it.
[2:38:28] &gt;&gt; And so if I were you this morning, I
[2:38:30] would, this is what I've done. If I were
[2:38:31] you this morning, I'd make it a serious
[2:38:33] concern in my life to say, "Lord, I'm
[2:38:35] stepping up.
[2:38:37] &gt;&gt; I just saw that many are putting things
[2:38:39] off just like you've got all the time in
[2:38:41] the world." None of us do.
[2:38:43] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter how old or how young.
[2:38:44] That's not how God does these things.
[2:38:46] Now, I want to tell you how sharp a and
[2:38:50] how how uh vigilant and diligent Sister
[2:38:54] Williams was when she began to express
[2:38:58] to Olivia
[2:39:00] the things that had been told her.
[2:39:04] She said, "I want to order some more uh
[2:39:07] Gospels of John. I I I I have uh three
[2:39:11] ministries left and that I'm doing, I
[2:39:13] think it was. and and I'm having a
[2:39:16] prayer meeting at night with my sister
[2:39:18] and my nephews and I'm handing out these
[2:39:21] and and what and and something and she
[2:39:23] said, "I I've got to get busy.
[2:39:28] I've got to get it done
[2:39:32] because there's nothing like the reality
[2:39:34] again of of of of seeing a moment
[2:39:38] of your vulnerability."
[2:39:41] And when you see your life like a drop
[2:39:43] of vapor on the glass,
[2:39:46] &gt;&gt; don't let it be too late
[2:39:49] &gt;&gt; for you to grab
[2:39:51] &gt;&gt; your destiny purpose and do something
[2:39:53] about it.
[2:39:56] &gt;&gt; Now, when that enemy moves on her, she
[2:39:58] might she might look at it a different
[2:40:01] way and this is the end. I don't know
[2:40:03] how. But I'm telling you, in in that
[2:40:05] moment, I think it was exactly holy
[2:40:08] clarity that moved over her in a in a
[2:40:11] very bad situation. And and she began to
[2:40:15] plan the future. And this is how we
[2:40:18] should respond.
[2:40:24] &gt;&gt; I saw many were putting things off like
[2:40:27] they had all the time in the world.
[2:40:28] Doesn't matter how old or young. There's
[2:40:30] not that's not how God does. None of us
[2:40:32] have time to get done what we've been
[2:40:35] called to get done. We have to do it
[2:40:37] now. Now is the time. And we are not the
[2:40:41] ones who get to decide the timing. We
[2:40:43] can't say, "Lord, I I'd like to do that
[2:40:45] when I get old. I'd like to do that when
[2:40:47] I get married. I'd like to do that when
[2:40:49] the children are raised."
[2:40:52] &gt;&gt; And I said that morning, and I'm reading
[2:40:54] it, and I'm saying again this morning, I
[2:40:56] need to know you're hearing me. Yes.
[2:40:59] &gt;&gt; For me, this is so critical and so
[2:41:01] serious. I I can't help it. I I hope you
[2:41:04] don't feel that it's just much to do,
[2:41:06] much to do over over something small. I
[2:41:09] think this is the I think this is I I
[2:41:12] really believe our future hangs in this
[2:41:14] kind of understanding.
[2:41:16] &gt;&gt; You you you've got it's now.
[2:41:21] &gt;&gt; Well, I I'm not equipped. I'm not. If
[2:41:24] you're willing and obedient,
[2:41:30] you're either going to forfeit destiny
[2:41:32] purposes
[2:41:34] or you're going to fulfill them.
[2:41:37] &gt;&gt; Romans 11:29, would you put that up
[2:41:39] quickly? It's 137. I want to take 10
[2:41:42] more minutes or so. Forfeite
[2:41:45] is not God changing his mind. Amen.
[2:41:48] &gt;&gt; Romans 11:29, for the gifts and callings
[2:41:50] of God are without repentance. God does
[2:41:55] not revoke his eternal purposes.
[2:41:59] &gt;&gt; If it was his will, it's his will.
[2:42:02] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[2:42:04] &gt;&gt; But forfeite happens because that was
[2:42:06] the word that was given in the
[2:42:08] experience. Forefeature happens when man
[2:42:12] refuses
[2:42:14] when man neglects or disqualifies
[2:42:17] himself from walking in the destiny
[2:42:20] purposes of God.
[2:42:23] &gt;&gt; Let me give you the definition of
[2:42:24] forfeite. Are you are you okay?
[2:42:27] &gt;&gt; Are you sure you're all right?
[2:42:28] forfeite means the loss of a right,
[2:42:32] the loss of a privilege or the loss of
[2:42:35] an inheritance as a consequence of
[2:42:38] neglect, refusal or disqualification.
[2:42:42] It is not stolen by another, but it's
[2:42:46] surrendered by the one to whom it
[2:42:50] belonged.
[2:42:52] &gt;&gt; Let me give you the spiritual
[2:42:53] definition. The definition of spiritual
[2:42:56] forfeite. Spiritual forfeite is the
[2:42:59] surrender of God-given opportunity,
[2:43:02] calling or inheritance through unbelief,
[2:43:06] neglect, fear, disobedience, or
[2:43:09] misplaced desire.
[2:43:11] It is not God's failure to give, but
[2:43:15] it's man's failure to claim.
[2:43:19] Yes.
[2:43:19] &gt;&gt; And once he has claimed the cause of
[2:43:22] God,
[2:43:25] &gt;&gt; he has to steward them
[2:43:28] &gt;&gt; and not squander them,
[2:43:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:43:31] &gt;&gt; And not waste them.
[2:43:34] &gt;&gt; Just let me get out of some of the debt
[2:43:36] I'm under.
[2:43:38] &gt;&gt; It's a reasonable It's a reasonable
[2:43:41] thought. Wouldn't it be great if we
[2:43:45] could be completely as individuals out
[2:43:48] of debt and then say, "Lord,
[2:43:51] &gt;&gt; I'm ready to be."
[2:43:54] &gt;&gt; But how likely is that? And why would
[2:43:57] you hang your destiny scroll
[2:44:01] &gt;&gt; in the balance
[2:44:06] &gt;&gt; when it's your opportunity? Somebody
[2:44:07] say, "I don't even know what I'm
[2:44:09] supposed to do." It's, you know what?
[2:44:11] I'm not only talking about uh you're
[2:44:14] supposed to be a teacher to the in the
[2:44:16] five-fold ministry or you're supposed to
[2:44:18] have a healing. I'm not I'm not only
[2:44:21] talking about that. I'm talking about
[2:44:23] you're to be an overcoming Christian.
[2:44:26] &gt;&gt; You're to be a believer who's in control
[2:44:28] of his emotions.
[2:44:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. and putting away childish things
[2:44:35] &gt;&gt; instead of out in the yard when tragedy
[2:44:37] strikes, when a problem comes up, giving
[2:44:40] the rest of the family silent treatment.
[2:44:42] Your children need your voice.
[2:44:46] &gt;&gt; Amen, sir.
[2:44:48] &gt;&gt; They need your tongue. They need your
[2:44:50] words.
[2:44:52] &gt;&gt; They need to know
[2:44:55] &gt;&gt; that you're there for them.
[2:44:58] But I'm going through. Yes, of course.
[2:45:01] Of course, we all are going through.
[2:45:05] &gt;&gt; But in our moment of going through, we
[2:45:08] cannot forget
[2:45:11] our responsibility.
[2:45:14] That's right.
[2:45:21] &gt;&gt; We can't forget
[2:45:24] that even in our going through, we have
[2:45:28] a responsibility to our wife,
[2:45:31] &gt;&gt; for what she's going through
[2:45:34] &gt;&gt; and our children, our teenagers, our
[2:45:36] adult married children
[2:45:39] &gt;&gt; for what they're going through.
[2:45:41] We don't get to check out as believers
[2:45:44] because life has gotten a little tough.
[2:45:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:53] &gt;&gt; We're needed.
[2:45:55] &gt;&gt; The society at large is a fatherless
[2:45:59] society
[2:46:01] &gt;&gt; and it's producing sissies
[2:46:06] &gt;&gt; because there are no fathers.
[2:46:10] The Bible said there there you know
[2:46:14] we the need the need for spiritual
[2:46:18] fathers.
[2:46:21] You you can't mentor somebody else's
[2:46:23] children when you won't mentor your own.
[2:46:31] &gt;&gt; It's our first assignment.
[2:46:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:46:34] &gt;&gt; I I I wish somebody would remind us when
[2:46:36] we're when we're saying I do
[2:46:40] &gt;&gt; that it's more than the honeymoon.
[2:46:45] &gt;&gt; It's I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do.
[2:46:48] I do. Because it's my it's my privilege
[2:46:51] and it's my responsibility to raise
[2:46:54] emotionally healthy children. No matter
[2:46:57] what I'm dealt with, no matter the fact
[2:46:59] that I didn't have a dad, no matter the
[2:47:01] fact that I didn't know how, no matter
[2:47:03] the fact that you didn't know how, we
[2:47:05] have a responsibility. And what do we do
[2:47:07] when we have something to do and we
[2:47:09] don't know how? Somebody said, "Google."
[2:47:11] No. Go on our knees.
[2:47:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:47:15] &gt;&gt; And we say, "I can't."
[2:47:18] &gt;&gt; But you can. Amen.
[2:47:23] &gt;&gt; We come together on the discipline issue
[2:47:25] because it's necessary and needful.
[2:47:28] &gt;&gt; And we come together and we make
[2:47:30] compromises and we agree the best that
[2:47:32] we can or it will haunt us,
[2:47:37] harass us, and trouble everybody around
[2:47:40] us because we sherked our own duty.
[2:47:44] &gt;&gt; So listen folks, that's part of destiny
[2:47:46] assignment. Again, it's not all a
[2:47:49] pullpit ministry.
[2:47:50] &gt;&gt; You want to be a priest, be the priest
[2:47:52] in your home.
[2:47:54] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:47:55] &gt;&gt; Keep your keep your emotions in check
[2:47:57] and do what God has called you to do.
[2:48:00] You're going to mess up. You're going to
[2:48:01] fail. You're going to Of course.
[2:48:05] &gt;&gt; But don't let your mantle filter down to
[2:48:08] somebody else.
[2:48:10] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:48:11] &gt;&gt; So, so don't get your eyes on grandeur.
[2:48:14] Get your eyes on just knowing. Lord,
[2:48:16] just show me. Let me be a Let me be a
[2:48:19] faithful amener. And may I not just amen
[2:48:22] with my mouth. May I amen with my life.
[2:48:25] Let me I'm not a singer, but let me
[2:48:27] support those who do sing specials.
[2:48:30] &gt;&gt; Let me pull on the gift in their life.
[2:48:32] Let me worship while they sing.
[2:48:35] &gt;&gt; You know, it doesn't have to be
[2:48:38] and the scroll is unrolled and God says,
[2:48:41] "I want you to be
[2:48:46] Find what you can do.
[2:48:49] &gt;&gt; Do what you can do and wait on your
[2:48:52] assignment to become clear. Stop
[2:48:54] bargaining with it.
[2:48:56] &gt;&gt; Quit trying to advance yourself.
[2:48:59] &gt;&gt; Push yourself forward. Live without a
[2:49:02] selfish ambition.
[2:49:05] &gt;&gt; Let God exalt. Let God make a way. Let
[2:49:08] God open the door.
[2:49:10] &gt;&gt; 50 years in a few weeks. September the
[2:49:13] 20th. We're celebrating in October.
[2:49:17] But September the 20th of this year,
[2:49:20] this month,
[2:49:22] 50 years ago, I preached my first
[2:49:23] sermon.
[2:49:26] Boy, no wonder I feel old this morning.
[2:49:29] I am, but I started pretty early. And I
[2:49:33] never made one phone call that I recall.
[2:49:37] And I thought about it pretty hard. I'm
[2:49:39] passing through.
[2:49:46] Boy, there were times, brother Gley, I
[2:49:48] needed an offering.
[2:49:51] I was living by offerings,
[2:49:54] not by tithe
[2:49:56] for some of those years.
[2:49:59] And brother Bill J,
[2:50:02] he's he's on up there. He's been through
[2:50:04] some strokes and but he's we're hoping
[2:50:08] he's he's positive about coming to the
[2:50:11] banquet in the service of the meeting. I
[2:50:13] hope he can.
[2:50:16] He'd come to me sometime in a revival
[2:50:18] away from where he was in Tennessee. I'd
[2:50:21] be up somewhere Virginia, West Virginia,
[2:50:24] South Carolina, North Carolina,
[2:50:26] sometimes somewhere else in Tennessee.
[2:50:28] and he'd come up after the service and
[2:50:31] he said, "I didn't see very much in the
[2:50:34] pan tonight."
[2:50:38] He said, "You think you'll have enough
[2:50:39] gas money to get home or get to the next
[2:50:41] place?" I said, "God always provides."
[2:50:45] He said, "Well, I got a 50 here. Let me
[2:50:47] give you this 50 and that ought to help
[2:50:48] a little bit." And it did then. Boy,
[2:50:52] that was two tanks.
[2:50:55] tank and a half in a little vehicle and
[2:50:59] and and just I know it's a little out of
[2:51:01] the way, but just come by tomorrow
[2:51:04] morning and let Shirley and Mama Faith
[2:51:07] cook you some biscuit and gravy and at
[2:51:09] least you'll have a tank full of gas and
[2:51:11] a big old meal, big old mountain
[2:51:13] breakfast to get you home. Brother,
[2:51:15] sister,
[2:51:19] that means more
[2:51:21] than I can I don't have words. You you
[2:51:23] don't have words looking back. God
[2:51:25] always made a way.
[2:51:27] &gt;&gt; He always made a way.
[2:51:29] Brother Henry Green came
[2:51:32] to the meetings and God would use him.
[2:51:34] He would sometimes stand and prophesy
[2:51:36] over the ministry that God had given me.
[2:51:39] And every other preacher in the room
[2:51:41] except Brother Dan Dasley would look at
[2:51:43] him like he had lost his mind.
[2:51:46] But he believed it. He obeyed what he
[2:51:50] felt. And
[2:51:52] he'd do the same.
[2:51:54] He'd call every Sunday night. How'd it
[2:51:58] go, son?
[2:52:00] How was the meeting? How was the revival
[2:52:02] where you were last week? How did the
[2:52:05] people respond? Do you need anything? I
[2:52:08] know there's just a handful now. Can we
[2:52:10] help you in any way? Folks,
[2:52:14] God will always
[2:52:19] &gt;&gt; never had to say, "I'm passing by. I'm
[2:52:21] coming through. I just want to worship
[2:52:24] with you, but I want you to know I'm
[2:52:25] coming." I never had to say, "I have a
[2:52:27] Friday night open. I have a Sunday open.
[2:52:30] I have a Saturday night open." Because I
[2:52:32] made up my mind when I started. I'll do
[2:52:34] this as long as God opens doors and as
[2:52:38] long as God makes a way and as long as
[2:52:40] God will help me, I'll do it. And he has
[2:52:42] and I have
[2:52:46] &gt;&gt; because if you accept what he's asking
[2:52:48] you to do, he will make a way.
[2:52:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:52:52] &gt;&gt; Every time.
[2:52:54] &gt;&gt; I'm not done yet, but I will be.
[2:52:59] I don't know why I put this up here. I
[2:53:00] wasn't quite through with it.
[2:53:03] Forefeature is not God changing his
[2:53:05] mind.
[2:53:07] It's when people let it slip
[2:53:10] through their fingers because they're
[2:53:13] focus self-centered and focused on their
[2:53:16] own burden, their own need, their own
[2:53:18] struggle, their own battle. And the
[2:53:20] destiny purposes of God are filtering
[2:53:22] out there. Be faithful.
[2:53:25] You don't have to have an invitation to
[2:53:27] pray.
[2:53:29] &gt;&gt; You don't even need a scroll to do that.
[2:53:32] &gt;&gt; Pray. Prepare the atmosphere.
[2:53:35] Get ready for what God's going to do.
[2:53:37] We're open. We're ready to hear
[2:53:39] &gt;&gt; what he has to say.
[2:53:41] &gt;&gt; I'll bring some of this another time.
[2:53:44] There's so much here that he laid on my
[2:53:47] heart. And uh if he did, then he'll give
[2:53:50] me an opportunity to share it with you.
[2:53:54] God's always got a he's always got
[2:53:56] somebody
[2:53:58] who will take the load.
[2:54:01] Closing with this quotation.
[2:54:04] And I haven't laid the foundation for
[2:54:06] it,
[2:54:08] but I want to give you something
[2:54:10] from the messenger. He said, this is uh
[2:54:14] speak to the rock and it shall give
[2:54:15] forth his water. It must have been a hot
[2:54:18] morning.
[2:54:20] Everybody was all confused and
[2:54:22] frustrated because all night long the
[2:54:24] cattle had bowled. You musicians slip
[2:54:27] quietly up here, would you please?
[2:54:30] The children had cried and the people
[2:54:32] had fussed and argued and quarreled and
[2:54:34] poor Moses.
[2:54:37] It was a dreadful time for him. You see,
[2:54:40] he had come down into Egypt and had
[2:54:42] brought the children out according to
[2:54:43] the promise of God and was leading them
[2:54:46] to the promised land, a land flowing
[2:54:48] with milk and honey, with a promise of
[2:54:50] God to protect them and to supply
[2:54:52] everything they had need of until they
[2:54:55] reached this glorious land flowing with
[2:54:58] milk and honey.
[2:55:01] Moses, a God called servant, ordained
[2:55:04] prophet, pillar of fire over him,
[2:55:06] following him, confirming the words that
[2:55:09] he spoke by signs and wonders on his
[2:55:11] road to the promised land with the
[2:55:14] children. A very definite antitype or
[2:55:17] type rather of the journey today.
[2:55:22] We're on our road to the promised land.
[2:55:24] And we're being led by the great Holy
[2:55:26] Spirit as and as they was led in the
[2:55:29] natural. We are led in the spiritual to
[2:55:32] this great promised land that God made
[2:55:34] the promise and gave to us. God had
[2:55:37] promised them to supply all their needs.
[2:55:40] Amen. Yes.
[2:55:41] &gt;&gt; But their carnal mind
[2:55:48] &gt;&gt; but their carnal mind had taken them out
[2:55:53] of the divine will of God
[2:55:58] and had given them
[2:56:02] a desert route.
[2:56:10] You mean that wasn't God's perfect will?
[2:56:12] No.
[2:56:15] It was what he had to do.
[2:56:19] He gave them a desert route. God had
[2:56:21] promised them to supply all their needs.
[2:56:24] But their carnal mind had taken them out
[2:56:27] of the divine will of God and had given
[2:56:30] them.
[2:56:31] Read it again.
[2:56:34] &gt;&gt; That's a whole lot of it today. He says
[2:56:36] that's what's the matter with many of
[2:56:37] our churches. They taken the carnal
[2:56:40] intellectual route and has been cut off
[2:56:45] the supplies of God's blessings of
[2:56:47] healing and power, the baptism of the
[2:56:49] Holy Ghost and have took Oh, God.
[2:56:57] &gt;&gt; They've took the desert out.
[2:57:01] Therefore, we have arguings and fusses
[2:57:03] and stews and complaints and we're
[2:57:07] focused on silly little childish things
[2:57:12] while the while the destiny scrolls and
[2:57:14] purposes of our life are floating by us
[2:57:18] and someone else is reaching out to take
[2:57:20] a hold of what was to be ours. I'll show
[2:57:24] I can show you, brother. I didn't know
[2:57:26] at the time how how many times I could
[2:57:29] show you through the scripture.
[2:57:33] Look at Saul.
[2:57:35] God said, "You're chosen through Samuel
[2:57:37] the prophet. You're chosen to lead this
[2:57:41] people." The same God came back and
[2:57:44] said, "Because of your pride,
[2:57:48] &gt;&gt; I am wrestling this kingdom. I am taking
[2:57:51] this kingdom out of your hand and I'm
[2:57:53] giving it to your neighbor because I
[2:57:55] know what he will do.
[2:57:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:57:58] &gt;&gt; So it scripturally is it possible to
[2:58:00] lose your death? Uhhuh.
[2:58:04] Is it possible to forfeit and lose the
[2:58:07] duration of what God could God have
[2:58:09] continued to use Saul? According to
[2:58:11] scripture, he could have continued to lo
[2:58:13] to use Saul and he did use Saul as long
[2:58:16] as Saul was little.
[2:58:20] Amen.
[2:58:21] &gt;&gt; In his own eyes.
[2:58:25] And if you read that carefully,
[2:58:28] you'll see the agony. If you think that
[2:58:31] Samuel marched in there like a holy holy
[2:58:35] and a prideful prophet and just slapped
[2:58:38] Saul around and said he was so broken.
[2:58:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "I loved Saul. I loved you.
[2:58:52] You do.
[2:58:54] You do. If you if God puts us a king in
[2:58:58] your life, if he puts a leader in your
[2:59:00] life, puts a mentor in your life, a good
[2:59:02] friend, and you love them. Not only
[2:59:04] spirit love, but you love their flesh.
[2:59:09] Brother Green said, "I
[2:59:14] don't know. God judges heart." He said,
[2:59:16] 'Brother Shelley, I didn't just love
[2:59:18] Brother Brandham because he was a
[2:59:19] prophet. I didn't just love him because
[2:59:22] he was a messenger to the church age. He
[2:59:24] said, 'I I learned I just loved I loved
[2:59:27] him. I loved his flesh. I loved the man.
[2:59:31] I loved the man. I just loved the man.
[2:59:35] And I loved the call on his life. Saul
[2:59:38] was loved by Samuel and it broke his
[2:59:42] heart to tell him, "I'm taking God says,
[2:59:46] "I'm taking the kingdom back."
[2:59:49] You're forfeiting it because of your own
[2:59:52] pride, because of your own decisions.
[2:59:56] You've lost the call. So, what will you
[2:59:59] do? Will you do nothing?
[3:00:02] If you're here today and your own messy
[3:00:05] life
[3:00:07] has caused you not to be able to fulfill
[3:00:10] your destiny purposes, what will you do?
[3:00:13] Will you just sit on the pew and coast?
[3:00:21] &gt;&gt; Okay. If if you if you if you've double
[3:00:24] married, if you've done this or that and
[3:00:26] you can't stand up here, is that the end
[3:00:28] of you?
[3:00:32] Can't you repent? Can't you do
[3:00:34] something?
[3:00:36] &gt;&gt; Can't you try to build somebody else up?
[3:00:40] &gt;&gt; Can't you help your brother? Can't you
[3:00:42] help your sister? Can you get out of
[3:00:44] your mentality of a celebrity and
[3:00:46] realize
[3:00:48] &gt;&gt; you can use a rake?
[3:00:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:00:52] &gt;&gt; Can't you do something? Yes,
[3:00:56] &gt;&gt; but Saul was out of his mind because
[3:00:59] when the spirit of the Lord lifted off
[3:01:01] of him,
[3:01:03] he was bonkers.
[3:01:06] Don't don't you don't have to wonder
[3:01:07] anymore. Can you forfeit? Yeah,
[3:01:13] it's a whole lot of it today. He said
[3:01:16] the the intellectual route has been cut
[3:01:18] off, the blessings cut off, the healing
[3:01:20] and power and baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[3:01:22] They've took the desert route.
[3:01:23] Therefore, we've got these arguments and
[3:01:24] fusses and stews and complaints. But
[3:01:26] those who are still remaining in the
[3:01:27] way,
[3:01:28] &gt;&gt; yes,
[3:01:29] &gt;&gt; it's joy unspeakable.
[3:01:35] &gt;&gt; You may do it.
[3:01:40] Can you do it with joy?
[3:01:43] Can you do it unto the Lord?
[3:01:49] I'm not lifting anybody up because I'm
[3:01:51] not going to put anybody down.
[3:01:53] I'm not going to do it. It's not my
[3:01:55] purpose.
[3:01:58] But it's amazing to see somebody
[3:02:02] pushing a lawnmower,
[3:02:04] dragging a hose
[3:02:09] with joy.
[3:02:13] Unbelievable.
[3:02:16] It was a joy to see people Monday
[3:02:20] with joy.
[3:02:23] No paycheck promised,
[3:02:25] just with joy. That's where we find
[3:02:28] that's where we can find
[3:02:31] doesn't mean that's all there ever is.
[3:02:33] But if a man can have more and
[3:02:37] temporarily be at peace
[3:02:41] with where God has placed and what and
[3:02:44] do it with joy
[3:02:47] instead of sitting back in the service
[3:02:54] stubborn really
[3:02:58] wanting somebody to feel sorry for them.
[3:03:00] You're the one you messed up. I didn't
[3:03:02] mess up. You messed up.
[3:03:06] &gt;&gt; Now, can't you do something for the
[3:03:07] Lord? Hasn't he continued to do
[3:03:10] something for you?
[3:03:12] &gt;&gt; Would you just let it keep falling
[3:03:14] around you?
[3:03:16] He said, "No, but
[3:03:19] how how the real born again church is
[3:03:21] moving on to the promised land. We are
[3:03:23] &gt;&gt; the promise of eternal life." Amen. A
[3:03:26] land flowing with eternal life where
[3:03:28] there's no more sickness, death, sorrow
[3:03:30] for nothing to harm. now. But when
[3:03:33] carnal minds
[3:03:36] began to come among them,
[3:03:43] &gt;&gt; listen,
[3:03:45] if you come in here Sunday
[3:03:47] &gt;&gt; and you pass the piano on your way in,
[3:03:51] just come on in anyway and don't even
[3:03:55] worry.
[3:03:56] Don't even wonder why the piano is
[3:03:59] sitting in the vestibule and not on the
[3:04:02] platform. You didn't come to see the
[3:04:04] piano.
[3:04:09] &gt;&gt; You came to worship God.
[3:04:12] &gt;&gt; If it's there, it's because somebody
[3:04:14] felt like that's where it ought to be.
[3:04:19] And a counsel was made. And you know how
[3:04:21] God did counsels, don't you?
[3:04:24] &gt;&gt; Within himself. Yes.
[3:04:27] &gt;&gt; And he felt the uncction of the Lord.
[3:04:29] And all of a sudden, I think that we
[3:04:31] would be better served by uh Sister
[3:04:34] Laurel, who's there here this morning
[3:04:35] today. She's going to play from the
[3:04:37] vestibule.
[3:04:40] That ought not to throw you off.
[3:04:45] &gt;&gt; What? What? David, I I think now from
[3:04:48] now on, you ought to be strumming that
[3:04:50] guitar
[3:04:53] over there.
[3:04:58] And if you're willing, it's because you
[3:05:00] know that it's something you can do for
[3:05:01] the Lord. And if you're willing and you
[3:05:03] accept the destiny scroll of that, it's
[3:05:05] not going to matter to you if you have
[3:05:07] to stand on your head to do it. What if
[3:05:09] I said, "I think we can find a place for
[3:05:11] you under that table to play your guitar
[3:05:12] for Jesus." I'm being
[3:05:15] &gt;&gt; facitious,
[3:05:17] &gt;&gt; but I hope you're hearing the point.
[3:05:21] It's just that
[3:05:23] desperate. It's It's that rubber meet
[3:05:27] moment. It's that It's that real.
[3:05:30] &gt;&gt; You're waiting on an explanation that
[3:05:32] never may come.
[3:05:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:05:34] &gt;&gt; Serve God.
[3:05:36] &gt;&gt; If I would that he tried till I come.
[3:05:40] What is that to you? Jesus said, "Why
[3:05:44] are you worried about John?
[3:05:47] &gt;&gt; What about John, Lord? What about John,
[3:05:50] Lord? What will John do, Lord?
[3:05:54] Woo.
[3:05:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:05:58] &gt;&gt; You ain't got time. I don't have time to
[3:06:02] worry what John will do. Will he fail?
[3:06:05] Will he succeed? Will he
[3:06:10] &gt;&gt; one of these days John might come
[3:06:11] stumbling out of a cave somewhere?
[3:06:17] Because Jesus said, "If I would that he
[3:06:20] tried till I come." What is that to you?
[3:06:23] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you be shocked
[3:06:26] &gt;&gt; if you get raptured with some old man?
[3:06:30] Who are you? I'm John.
[3:06:33] I've been living up here in the woods
[3:06:35] somewhere cuz Jesus said if Oh, don't
[3:06:39] you
[3:06:41] Why don't you make a clip and show that
[3:06:43] one around
[3:06:46] that crazy false doctrine?
[3:06:49] It's none of my business. It's none of
[3:06:51] my business. It's none of my business.
[3:06:54] If God says we we we need to do it,
[3:06:56] let's just do it. Let's just do it.
[3:06:58] Let's not wait on the long explanation.
[3:07:01] Just do what God says. Let's just be
[3:07:03] willing. Oh my goodness,
[3:07:06] Zach.
[3:07:09] I think of you.
[3:07:12] I thought of you the morning that this
[3:07:14] came.
[3:07:16] I thought of others
[3:07:20] with destiny purposes.
[3:07:25] And life is hard and it's busy.
[3:07:31] And nobody tells you because they're all
[3:07:33] afraid to say it like it really is.
[3:07:38] And nobody tells mothers.
[3:07:43] The reality is it gets a to be a lot
[3:07:49] too much at times.
[3:07:52] It consumes
[3:07:55] all that you the strength you have and
[3:07:58] the time and the energy you have. But if
[3:08:02] God blessed you with them,
[3:08:06] he didn't do it so that you could have
[3:08:08] an excuse
[3:08:11] to say, "I can't do what God wanted me
[3:08:14] to do because of all these kids." You
[3:08:17] sure enjoyed getting them here.
[3:08:24] You have to find a way,
[3:08:27] Lord. If I can't do it all now, if I
[3:08:30] can't do all you called me to do because
[3:08:32] I have to spread myself so thin, mama
[3:08:36] Ashley, mama's,
[3:08:40] I have to spread Liz. I have to spread
[3:08:42] myself, Kendra, so thin. And so I can't
[3:08:46] do all
[3:08:48] that I want to do and all that he's
[3:08:50] called me to do. Do something.
[3:08:55] Do something for him. Don't use these
[3:08:58] gifts as excuses. Don't do Don't use
[3:09:01] what God allows as an excuse to let
[3:09:04] somebody else take the load. If it's
[3:09:06] your if your name is on it, honey,
[3:09:09] there's nobody can do it like you can do
[3:09:11] it.
[3:09:13] Oh Jesus.
[3:09:23] The reality is, yes,
[3:09:25] in a church this size, you can always
[3:09:27] find somebody else to jump up. But the
[3:09:30] reality is, if God put your name on it,
[3:09:36] nobody then can do it like you can.
[3:09:44] I told sister Sharon at the last meal,
[3:09:47] she
[3:09:48] I know she is a often radiant
[3:09:52] and you think of her as 50ish,
[3:09:58] but the reality is she's not.
[3:10:02] She would be a senior by anybody's free
[3:10:04] coffee discount.
[3:10:08] and her joy is just to serve.
[3:10:12] And I told her the last one, I'm so glad
[3:10:14] you don't charge by the hour.
[3:10:19] I don't want to I I I'm not trying to
[3:10:21] put somebody down by putting somebody
[3:10:23] up. I I'm not doing any I'm not trying
[3:10:25] to do anything like that. I'm just
[3:10:26] saying
[3:10:30] please don't forfeit
[3:10:33] your opportunity
[3:10:37] by making some excuse.
[3:10:40] You can pray.
[3:10:44] &gt;&gt; Some of us don't even read our Bible.
[3:10:48] We don't hear the prophet's message.
[3:10:55] How can we get spiritual? How can we be
[3:10:58] closer to the Lord if we're not feeding
[3:11:01] on life?
[3:11:04] &gt;&gt; Okay, you can't do sometimes what other
[3:11:06] people can do. But you can pray, you can
[3:11:08] read, you can eat.
[3:11:13] &gt;&gt; You You're going to come and try to
[3:11:15] teach some of correct us on scripture
[3:11:17] when you haven't picked up your Bible in
[3:11:19] a year. Some of you, this is the tr
[3:11:21] truth. I love you.
[3:11:24] Some of you don't even know where your
[3:11:26] Bible is.
[3:11:30] If I ask you to produce it, you'd have
[3:11:32] to hunt it.
[3:11:36] Some of you may be like me. You've got
[3:11:39] 50.
[3:11:40] You might have to hunt the one you're
[3:11:42] looking for.
[3:11:44] But I'm never too far away from that
[3:11:46] one. I know where it is because I use
[3:11:48] it. Yes, I have it on my phone. Yes, I
[3:11:51] have it on my laptop. Yes, I have it on
[3:11:52] my computer. But I use it. It's a sword
[3:11:56] to me.
[3:11:57] &gt;&gt; Don't let life get so busy. You don't
[3:12:00] have to. I don't care. You don't have to
[3:12:02] sit down and read 10 chapters.
[3:12:05] &gt;&gt; Read a half a chapter in Jesus' name and
[3:12:07] say, "Lord, help me. I've given you
[3:12:09] this. You deserve more. You deserve
[3:12:12] more. But right now, this is what I
[3:12:14] have. And I'm instead of listening to
[3:12:18] some song or some uh podcast or
[3:12:20] something when you're walking for
[3:12:22] exercise or whatever it is you do or
[3:12:24] drive to work or drive home, feed.
[3:12:29] &gt;&gt; Feed. Get the spiritual man ready so
[3:12:33] that when the anointings come and the
[3:12:35] callings fall, you grab yours.
[3:12:41] Yes.
[3:12:42] &gt;&gt; And in that moment, you don't try to
[3:12:44] disqualify yourself and say, "I'm not
[3:12:46] worthy." He wouldn't have put your name
[3:12:48] on it.
[3:12:50] &gt;&gt; If he wasn't going to help you do it,
[3:12:51] let's stand. If you put your name on it,
[3:12:55] it's because he knew that in time.
[3:12:59] &gt;&gt; You would let him fill you with his
[3:13:02] life.
[3:13:03] &gt;&gt; Oh.
[3:13:41] I don't want to forfeit. I want to
[3:13:43] fulfill.
[3:13:49] &gt;&gt; Every church is sovereign. And
[3:13:54] &gt;&gt; the man is going to answer. I'm going to
[3:13:57] answer. Every man's going to answer for
[3:14:00] what he does, what he allows,
[3:14:03] what he doesn't allow.
[3:14:06] how he does it.
[3:14:08] It's all It's all going to matter.
[3:14:13] It's heavy.
[3:14:16] And some people think it's kind of
[3:14:18] ridiculous for a church to feel like
[3:14:20] they have their own commission,
[3:14:23] their own purpose.
[3:14:26] I think it makes a lot of sense.
[3:14:31] If every church was just alike and did
[3:14:33] it all just alike,
[3:14:36] that would be a denomination.
[3:14:39] There's plenty of them.
[3:14:42] But a church has to find a vision. It
[3:14:44] has to find a purpose. It has to find a
[3:14:46] scroll, a commission, a reason for
[3:14:49] being. And then they have to run hard as
[3:14:52] a body of people. One vision. running
[3:14:55] hard after what God would have us to do
[3:14:57] as a people, what God would have us to
[3:14:59] do individually. And so, if you hear us
[3:15:02] focusing for the next few months on this
[3:15:04] house and what God's called us to do,
[3:15:07] uh, don't let it discourage you
[3:15:11] or distract you or confuse you.
[3:15:14] The only way to show the house to the
[3:15:16] house is to show the house to the house.
[3:15:18] Amen.
[3:15:19] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we just have to see not
[3:15:21] only where we get it right and where we
[3:15:22] don't get it right. We just have to see
[3:15:24] why we're together.
[3:15:26] &gt;&gt; You should ask,
[3:15:29] you should ask somebody sometime, "Why
[3:15:30] are you here? How'd you get here? What
[3:15:34] brought you here?" Try not to say, "Why
[3:15:36] are you here?"
[3:15:40] There's a bunch of nuts
[3:15:43] in this house.
[3:15:47] But here's what makes the difference.
[3:15:51] They've been threaded to the right bolt.
[3:15:55] If you wanted carbon copy people, if you
[3:15:57] wanted plastic church members, plastic
[3:16:01] message believers,
[3:16:04] they're dime a dozen.
[3:16:07] I don't mind nuts.
[3:16:09] I don't mind unique. I don't mind
[3:16:11] eccentric. I don't mind strange. I've
[3:16:14] It's It's a I've I'm a I'm a strange
[3:16:16] magnet. I can I seem to draw oddities.
[3:16:24] But as long as we're threaded to him,
[3:16:27] we love one another. We can appreciate
[3:16:30] one another. And we don't try to force
[3:16:32] somebody else to be like us. We want
[3:16:35] them to be who God made them to serve
[3:16:38] the greater good. I feel I feel the Lord
[3:16:42] even in all of this. I feel him. I I I
[3:16:45] it's not about feeling him, but I feel
[3:16:47] him.
[3:16:49] I feel Jesus.
[3:16:54] [Music]
[3:16:56] I feel Jesus.
[3:17:00] [Music]
[3:17:03] I feel Jesus.
[3:17:08] [Music]
[3:17:09] He's in this place.
[3:17:15] [Music]
[3:17:17] And my soul
[3:17:21] does
[3:17:24] burn
[3:17:26] within.
[3:17:30] [Music]
[3:17:36] &gt;&gt; Glory. He's in
[3:17:40] this place. We'll speed it up in a
[3:17:42] little while. Let's sing it just like
[3:17:44] that again. I feel Jes.
[3:17:48] [Music]
[3:17:50] Have you been sitting down on your
[3:17:51] scroll? I feel Jesus.
[3:17:57] Have you let your past define your
[3:17:59] present? I feel Jesus.
[3:18:06] He's in
[3:18:08] this place.
[3:18:14] And my soul
[3:18:18] does
[3:18:20] burn
[3:18:22] within
[3:18:24] me.
[3:18:28] I feel Jesus.
[3:18:31] [Music]
[3:18:34] He's in.
[3:18:37] Have you let not knowing exactly what
[3:18:39] you were to do keep you from doing
[3:18:41] anything? I feel Jesus.
[3:18:46] And even if I didn't feel him, I'm going
[3:18:48] to serve him. I feel Jesus.
[3:18:56] Oh, I feel Jesus.
[3:19:02] He's in
[3:19:05] this place.
[3:19:06] [Music]
[3:19:08] Have you sat in the seat of a scornful?
[3:19:14] &gt;&gt; Have you criticized others who are doing
[3:19:17] more than you were doing?
[3:19:21] Now is your opportunity to square that
[3:19:24] up.
[3:19:26] Today is your opportunity to square that
[3:19:29] up and say, "Lord, I'll take the baton.
[3:19:33] may not look like what I thought it was
[3:19:35] going to look like, but I'll do
[3:19:36] something for the kingdom. I
[3:19:40] feel
[3:19:44] Lord, these are some of the best folks.
[3:19:50] It's the cream of the crop.
[3:19:53] [Music]
[3:19:56] Help us today.
[3:19:59] I don't want to forfeit. They don't want
[3:20:01] to forfeit.
[3:20:03] I don't want you to have to take
[3:20:05] something from me and give it to
[3:20:06] somebody else because I wasn't faithful
[3:20:10] or because I got big in my own eyes.
[3:20:19] &gt;&gt; We just want to be faithful.
[3:20:22] I feel Jesus.
[3:20:26] If you feel like you ought to come and
[3:20:28] stand with him, come.
[3:20:31] You don't have to come to pray. You can
[3:20:33] pray where you are. But if you just feel
[3:20:35] like you want to move forward, do it. I
[3:20:37] feel
[3:20:40] &gt;&gt; I know it's late. I know you're tired.
[3:20:43] I
[3:20:46] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[3:20:47] [Music]
[3:20:49] Oh, I feel Jesus.
[3:20:56] is in
[3:20:59] this place.
[3:21:01] And my soul
[3:21:04] and my
[3:21:06] soul,
[3:21:08] [Music]
[3:21:19] I feel Jesus.
[3:21:23] [Music]
[3:21:29] Just play that a moment when you're
[3:21:30] sitting in your home and you are
[3:21:33] overwhelmed.
[3:21:34] [Music]
[3:21:37] All you see is what's wrong. You can't
[3:21:40] even see what's right
[3:21:43] and you're just ruminating on it and
[3:21:45] it's just rolling over and over in your
[3:21:47] head. You're getting lower and lower,
[3:21:48] lower. If you could just catch yourself,
[3:21:52] if you could just awaken in that moment
[3:21:54] like the prodigal
[3:21:56] and you could just say, "Lord,
[3:21:57] everything I've been thinking sort of
[3:21:59] the way it looks, but I better use this
[3:22:02] time
[3:22:04] &gt;&gt; instead of feeling sorry for myself and
[3:22:06] my family, and I I ought to use this
[3:22:09] time to tell you that you've been so
[3:22:11] faithful to me.
[3:22:13] &gt;&gt; I've lived my life in the goodness of
[3:22:15] the Lord, even when it was rough. Amen.
[3:22:18] &gt;&gt; I just want to tell you sitting right
[3:22:20] here,
[3:22:22] &gt;&gt; I've lived in the goodness of the Lord
[3:22:24] and I don't have any reason to complain.
[3:22:28] &gt;&gt; If you'll just help me, Lord, to get up
[3:22:30] and give you praise, I want to do it.
[3:22:33] Don't waste a moment.
[3:22:36] Don't waste an opportunity to have to
[3:22:39] feel strength and to be helped by
[3:22:43] mulling around on all that's wrong. He's
[3:22:46] right.
[3:22:48] &gt;&gt; We used to sing when I was young, Jesus
[3:22:50] is right for whatever's wrong in your
[3:22:54] life. And it's true. Doesn't matter what
[3:22:57] you're carrying. He's enough.
[3:23:01] &gt;&gt; He's big enough. He's God enough.
[3:23:06] &gt;&gt; You say, "But my questions are so big."
[3:23:08] Well, he's big answers.
[3:23:11] &gt;&gt; If you believe that, say amen. Amen.
[3:23:14] &gt;&gt; He's got big answers.
[3:23:18] &gt;&gt; If I called somebody's name, don't let
[3:23:20] it be a burden to you. It was it was
[3:23:22] just a way to make it personal.
[3:23:26] I just remembered that morning after
[3:23:28] that experience.
[3:23:30] I just started thinking of things that
[3:23:32] God had said to different ones. And
[3:23:34] we're
[3:23:36] I was going to read to you if I could
[3:23:38] have got to it.
[3:23:41] Habachok,
[3:23:44] write the vision.
[3:23:46] &gt;&gt; Make it plain on table so that he may
[3:23:49] run that readeth it.
[3:23:52] &gt;&gt; Though it wait,
[3:23:54] &gt;&gt; though the vision tar,
[3:23:57] &gt;&gt; wait for it,
[3:24:00] &gt;&gt; the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.
[3:24:04] Maybe you're burdened today with hope
[3:24:06] deferred and it didn't happen the way
[3:24:08] you wanted
[3:24:10] and you're afraid it's all downhill from
[3:24:13] here. That's a lie of the enemy.
[3:24:16] &gt;&gt; There's a place for you on Zion.
[3:24:22] &gt;&gt; There's a capstone coming for you.
[3:24:33] I feel Jesus.
[3:24:40] He's in this place. Oh Jesus, help me
[3:24:47] and my soul.
[3:24:51] [Music]
[3:24:58] Oh,
[3:24:59] [Music]
[3:25:04] help me.
[3:25:07] [Music]
[3:25:09] &gt;&gt; Let me just encourage you to cry out,
[3:25:12] call out to the Lord right now for
[3:25:14] whatever it is you want to tell him. Do
[3:25:16] it right now. Lord, here we are.
[3:25:20] &gt;&gt; Just say, "Jesus, here I am.
[3:25:25] I don't want to waste another moment.
[3:25:33] &gt;&gt; Show me what I can do.
[3:25:37] Equip me. Anoint me.
[3:25:41] Make a way.
[3:25:46] Help me carry the load.
[3:25:51] Help me stay out of my head
[3:25:55] &gt;&gt; and in your word.
[3:26:00] [Music]
[3:26:08] &gt;&gt; I
[3:26:10] feel Jesus.
[3:26:15] I
[3:26:18] [Music]
[3:26:21] Oh, I
[3:26:28] hear
[3:26:29] [Music]
[3:26:31] Oh,
[3:26:33] [Music]
[3:26:35] and my soul
[3:26:41] [Music]
[3:26:49] I feel Jesus.
[3:26:52] [Music]
[3:26:55] He's in
[3:26:57] this place.
[3:27:00] Let the Lord help you help somebody
[3:27:02] else. Let the Lord use you.
[3:27:06] Everybody that will, let the Lord use
[3:27:08] you for just a moment to be strength to
[3:27:10] somebody else. You say, "I don't have
[3:27:12] any strength of my own." You'd be
[3:27:13] surprised what you have when you start
[3:27:15] trying to help somebody else get a
[3:27:17] little strength. You don't

[3:36:15] And until they do, may she find comfort
[3:36:18] in who she is in you.

[3:39:06] &gt;&gt; Lord. I know there are destiny scrolls
[3:39:09] &gt;&gt; that belong to David.
[3:39:12] &gt;&gt; I know he has the desire. I know he has
[3:39:14] the burden at times.
[3:39:17] &gt;&gt; I know he's felt the pull at times.
[3:39:22] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm asking you to protect that
[3:39:25] &gt;&gt; even in this season.
[3:39:27] my soul.
[3:39:28] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want you to show him today
[3:39:31] &gt;&gt; that's standing right next to him.
[3:39:34] &gt;&gt; It's his first ministry.
[3:39:37] [Music]
[3:39:39] &gt;&gt; It's his first congregation.
[3:39:42] &gt;&gt; Lord, I pray, oh God, that he would not
[3:39:45] see
[3:39:46] &gt;&gt; his family. I don't think he does, but I
[3:39:48] I wouldn't want him to ever see it as a
[3:39:51] burden. Lord,
[3:39:53] &gt;&gt; may he see it as an opportunity.
[3:39:56] for priesthood.
[3:40:00] &gt;&gt; Raise him up today
[3:40:03] &gt;&gt; as a priest
[3:40:06] &gt;&gt; to his precious wife,
[3:40:08] &gt;&gt; these amazing children that you've given
[3:40:10] them.
[3:40:12] &gt;&gt; May he find strength and grace and
[3:40:15] health
[3:40:16] to pour into them.
[3:40:21] &gt;&gt; May he never take from them.
[3:40:25] May he only pour into them.
[3:40:28] &gt;&gt; You will be his strength.
[3:40:31] &gt;&gt; You will be his validation.
[3:40:34] &gt;&gt; You will be his encouragement.
[3:40:37] &gt;&gt; May he give to them first.
[3:40:40] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[3:40:43] &gt;&gt; May he set a standard
[3:40:47] &gt;&gt; for others. May he feel an upward call.
[3:40:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:40:52] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[3:40:54] Give him the courage to lay his hands on
[3:40:57] his wife's head
[3:41:00] &gt;&gt; in the in the in the in the privacy even
[3:41:04] of their own home and just say, "Jesus,
[3:41:07] fill this wife you've given me. Fill her
[3:41:11] with strength and help and hope.
[3:41:15] &gt;&gt; May he find ministry.
[3:41:19] &gt;&gt; May you use him.
[3:41:21] It's it's so necessary.
[3:41:23] [Music]
[3:41:28] &gt;&gt; It's not right. It's not normal. It's
[3:41:30] not God's order for her to look anywhere
[3:41:33] else for strength
[3:41:35] &gt;&gt; except to Jesus
[3:41:38] &gt;&gt; and to you,
[3:41:42] &gt;&gt; Lord. May he be that.
[3:41:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, these little children there. Here's
[3:41:46] a one so little it's he's hardly
[3:41:49] impressionable yet, but he will be.
[3:41:53] Everything he sees and everything he
[3:41:55] feels, everything Aiana feels
[3:41:59] &gt;&gt; will affect them.
[3:42:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, may they see daddy becoming a well,
[3:42:07] &gt;&gt; a well of rich life and strength and
[3:42:10] hope,

[3:42:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus.
[3:42:29] &gt;&gt; It's easy. I just feel like in marriage
[3:42:31] it's so easy to criticize. I know I've
[3:42:34] done it. It's so easy to criticize. It's
[3:42:38] harder. It's actually harder to take
[3:42:40] courage and try to minister

[3:42:44] everything there is to know about you.
[3:42:46] She knows all your strengths and your
[3:42:48] weaknesses.
[3:42:50] And it's hard sometimes to step out of
[3:42:55] husband and daddy role into a into a
[3:42:57] place of spiritual ministry. But we have
[3:42:59] to do it.
[3:43:04] &gt;&gt; We have to pastor our own families. We
[3:43:07] have to Hallelujah.
[3:43:11] &gt;&gt; I don't know why it was to be like this,
[3:43:13] but I just Okay,

[3:43:18] all will just take it and not be
[3:43:21] &gt;&gt; feel like I'm pointing you out in some
[3:43:23] way. I'm not at all.

[3:51:32] just bend. I feel the weight of them. Be
[3:51:35] seated just a moment. This won't take
[3:51:37] but a second. I'm sorry that it's nearly
[3:51:39] 3:00. But since nobody has church on
[3:51:42] Sunday night, you've had your Sunday
[3:51:45] morning and Sunday night all combined.
[3:51:48] Amen.
[3:51:49] &gt;&gt; Sister Deborah Gossman's birthday is is
[3:51:52] today. And they're faithful streamers.
[3:51:54] We send her love. And it's also Shiloh
[3:51:57] River's birthday today. Is she How old
[3:52:00] is she? Three. Uh would you all say
[3:52:03] happy birthday to her? Shiloh River.
[3:52:06] Happy birthday.
[3:52:08] [Applause]
[3:52:12] We've been doing a lot of things and
[3:52:14] making a lot of plans for camp meeting
[3:52:16] and we have done mockups and markdowns
[3:52:20] and draw. We drew lines and we've we
[3:52:25] figured a way to get more people in
[3:52:28] here. Yesterday they came and built a
[3:52:31] platform in the studio to get the camera
[3:52:33] up off the ground. We will take some of
[3:52:37] the furniture and equipment out of the
[3:52:39] studio if necessary and put seats in
[3:52:42] there. We have a way to put chairs here
[3:52:44] and there and some in the back. We don't
[3:52:47] want to do a a spill over if we don't
[3:52:50] have to. We want everybody to get in.
[3:52:52] Even if it's not as comfortable as we
[3:52:54] like for it to be, we can do it. We can
[3:52:58] make a way for 300 people, but it'll be
[3:53:01] tight. What a wonderful, glorious,
[3:53:05] hallelujah problem to have.
[3:53:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:53:10] We have now 221
[3:53:15] people who are either our own church
[3:53:18] folks or those who have reached out to
[3:53:22] say we're coming for the banquet. Some
[3:53:26] of that is children but not babies.
[3:53:31] We do not have enough tables to to uh
[3:53:35] hold the the amount of people that we
[3:53:38] know are coming. nor do we have enough
[3:53:40] chairs. We'll mention perhaps that to
[3:53:43] you later, but we're going to have to do
[3:53:45] it. We have to have chairs and and
[3:53:47] tables for the for the folks to sit at.
[3:53:50] We bought quite a few last year, but
[3:53:52] we're going to need some more. Um the
[3:53:56] fellowship hall is big. It looks so big
[3:53:58] when it's empty, but when it gets people
[3:54:00] in there, it looks looks a little
[3:54:02] fuller, doesn't it? So, we're going to
[3:54:04] need to to locate purchase some more
[3:54:08] tables and chairs. What I'm doing now is
[3:54:10] to tell you two things. One is they they
[3:54:14] I didn't decide this, but it has been
[3:54:17] decided and I didn't veto it that we
[3:54:20] that we wear church clothes that we're
[3:54:22] coming. It says on the invitation
[3:54:23] semiformal. Well,
[3:54:26] I I don't know what that is. And I'm
[3:54:30] certainly not wearing a bow tie or
[3:54:31] anything like that. We're just going to
[3:54:33] dress up for church. So, if you wear
[3:54:36] church, no jeans, but if you're coming
[3:54:38] for church, let's let's let's make it a
[3:54:41] special for everyone who comes. And I
[3:54:44] didn't make that decision, but spread it
[3:54:46] around. We don't want to have to have
[3:54:48] somebody at the door saying, "You're not
[3:54:50] dressed for the wedding banquet."
[3:54:52] Um, just kidding. That was in my notes
[3:54:56] to talk about the but I didn't get that
[3:54:58] far. Uh, the other thing is if you know
[3:55:01] we have a we have some coming from the
[3:55:03] Netherlands, some coming from Iceland.
[3:55:08] This 221 again it includes our adults,
[3:55:13] most of our children, none of our
[3:55:15] babies, and then those who have said
[3:55:16] that they would be coming and and given
[3:55:19] RSVP because my wife sent out some
[3:55:22] invitations by text to people that we
[3:55:24] thought might be interested to come.
[3:55:26] There is a group coming from Arizona
[3:55:29] that is not included in this number and
[3:55:31] that could be up to 30 people.
[3:55:34] So, we don't know the the number, but we
[3:55:36] know they're coming. Some have even
[3:55:38] reached out this week to my wife to say
[3:55:41] we stream and we're not going to miss
[3:55:43] it.
[3:55:44] So, uh if you have told someone they
[3:55:48] could stay with you or if someone has
[3:55:50] told you we're coming and you haven't
[3:55:52] gotten the word to Sister Stacy that
[3:55:55] they will also be here for the banquet,
[3:55:57] it's important that we know. We feel
[3:56:00] like there may be people who show up
[3:56:02] that night who don't know that it's not
[3:56:03] a service and we have to make room for
[3:56:05] them as well. We can't say we can't say
[3:56:09] you don't have an invitation. You can't
[3:56:11] come in here. You're we're full. We have
[3:56:13] to do all we can. And so let's try to
[3:56:17] figure this out and and get numbers to
[3:56:20] her if we possibly can. 221, that's
[3:56:24] quite a crowd already. And uh if there
[3:56:26] are 20 or 30 coming from Tucson, that
[3:56:28] puts us over to 50. And that puts us
[3:56:32] getting close to where we know that we
[3:56:35] can even put that many tables. We have a
[3:56:37] plan, but the plan is it it will run out
[3:56:40] eventually. We have some uh special
[3:56:44] tables that we ordered and paid for.
[3:56:47] idea that would give the children a
[3:56:49] little little
[3:56:52] picnic-l like table and and uh maybe
[3:56:54] take up a little bit less space so we
[3:56:56] could all get in. But I I don't want to
[3:56:58] take your time. I just want you to know
[3:57:00] that we don't usually do things like
[3:57:02] this, but this time we have to be pretty
[3:57:04] serious about it. We have to let them
[3:57:06] know um the the caterers, we have to let
[3:57:10] them know uh by the first of
[3:57:13] October.
[3:57:15] So, um, is there anybody here that you
[3:57:17] know you've got somebody staying with
[3:57:19] you, but you're not sure if that number
[3:57:21] has been turned into Sister Stacy? Are
[3:57:24] there any of you that have family
[3:57:26] members coming
[3:57:28] and you know that they're coming and
[3:57:30] their their name has not been turned
[3:57:31] into Sister Stacy?
[3:57:34] If you're not a regular, if they're not
[3:57:36] a regular, if they come once a year or
[3:57:39] something like that, they're not going
[3:57:40] to be on the list and we need to know.
[3:57:43] Sister Martha raised her hand. So
[3:57:48] Charity said, "All right." Yes. I think
[3:57:50] a lot of the former Amish have been
[3:57:52] included. Yes.
[3:57:56] Yes. We have Zion and Solomon.
[3:58:00] Anybody else know of anybody? Sorry,
[3:58:02] Sister Beverly.
[3:58:05] We're waiting on them. Oh, you did? We
[3:58:08] sent them a invitation and waiting on
[3:58:10] their report, but they are coming. This
[3:58:12] number's
[3:58:13] Sister West too.
[3:58:17] Sarah wasn't sure. Maybe. Right. Maybe.
[3:58:19] So anyway, God bless you. You're
[3:58:21] dismissed to go. Please don't let us
[3:58:23] down in this matter if because if
[3:58:26] someone is coming and you know it, it's
[3:58:28] better to tell us so that we'll have
[3:58:30] plenty of food for them. It's going to
[3:58:32] be a wonderful spiritual Holy Ghost week
[3:58:35] of meetings. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[3:58:37] &gt;&gt; Don't let one more of your Don't let one
[3:58:41] more scroll pass you by.
[3:58:44] &gt;&gt; I love you. God bless you. I
[3:58:48] I know it's 3:00.
[3:58:50] More church than most people can handle.
[3:58:52] I'm glad you're not most people.
[3:58:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:58:56] &gt;&gt; Tuesday night.
