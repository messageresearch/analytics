this place hallelujah worthy worthy worthy are you lamb hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord you may be seated this morning it is so good to be in the house of the lord this morning amen hallelujah i'm so thankful to be gathered this morning amen it's been too long i know there are many needs this morning many many more than i can remember remember all their suffering with the virus this morning recovering i know it's it's a tough road for a lot of people that are recovering this morning so let's remember do you have an unspoken need this morning by the lifting of your hand yeah there are many amen would you remember sister pam hendrix to the lord in prayer that god will touch her in a mighty way it seems that the lord is helping her and her family is being strengthened to put their trust and faith in the lord and i'm in a a little group where jacob is so faithful to uh update us about four or five times a day and uh she's doing a little better every every report getting a little better so we want to believe the lord and i want you to pray specifically against blood clots i know that the lord is able to keep that out of her body and out of her life as they turn her back and forth this is a very dangerous part of the ventilator it's laying on your stomach is what they found to be most effective for covid when you lay on your back your lungs flatten against your the back of your rib cage and so when you're on the uh ventilator like that they like to turn you over and the problem is after someone lays like that all night long especially someone of size then when you turn them back over it's if if a blood clot is formed it has a tendency to move toward an extremity so may god bring her through with complete and total victory and may they be so on fire for the lord i was praying and i remembered how fired up they were when god healed casey hannah and i know that god can bring her through and give them that same kind of fire that's what we're asking the lord would you remember a friend of many of us the regina christian who is in the hospital and she was doing better but her oxygen levels are going up and down which is really sort of common when you're fighting the virus but they're offering her a ventilator and she's not ready to make that decision so could we ask the lord to stabilize those blood oxygen levels for her that she would not have to make a decision like that sister rebecca shepard needs to be remembered to the lord in prayer there i think they're doing better from all the other fights but her sugar level she has low blood sugar and it's causing her to feel very weak olivia ellsworth is running a low-grade fever and having a sore throat so we want to lift her up to the lord in prayer and ginger has many needs and she's been fighting a real battle with her vehicle and you know for me i just get mine repaired and i have a credit card if i have to do it but you know someone in in her position she would just turn purple if she was here it's a struggle because you're you don't know where to take it who to take it to and you you don't know how you're going to make it happen when it so would you just ask the lord to give her such grace and favor and victory would you continue to remember more reigns to the lord and and brother cary to the lord and so many others that are fighting the weakness and the fatigue and of course we're going to pray for those that that fought their way to get here today we folks we have so much to be thankful for so much to be thankful for if you don't believe it let me suggest a few websites to you later you come ask me privately and i'll suggest a few websites and you can go and visit our sister churches around the country and you'll see a funeral after a funeral after a funeral after a funeral in the last three weeks and we're so blessed we have nothing to brag about except jesus and and i know i know that they had the same jesus we do so so i am not in any way saying anything except your goodness is running after me all my life you have been faithful i said it in october when we lost our brother i would say it regardless of the circumstances god is faithful prayer works and god's will is being accomplished but we don't want to forget those that are battling it it is not an it is not an easy thing to go through and everyone is affected differently i just want to get all this out of the way before i take the pulpit everyone is affected differently and that worries people sometimes you know what i didn't have it like that or i had it worse or or you're just we're just different and it strikes us different it affects us different you don't have to feel like that if you're here and you think well i surely give it to somebody we have no way of calculating all that the way it looks to me in my mind it came to us in more than one direction from more than one direction and it had to happen this way now we're getting our antibodies up getting ready for camp meeting if that's the will of god there's a reason for all things so if you're here and you feel like well i surely give i know i hug so i know i did listen if you would have known that you would have never done something somebody said oh but i came to church with the fever i didn't know i didn't if you would have known i don't believe there's a person here this morning that would have wanted to give it especially after coming through it you wouldn't want to would you i know you didn't want to so there's no reason to spend too much time now anytime trying to figure it all out it's all the grace of god and god is speaking he is speaking he uses all things to talk and he is talking may god give us ears to hear eyes to see and come through this with great victory and and uh others i could go on that requested prayer but we all have unspoken requests for sure what about the rabbi i haven't had a report today from rabbi friedman but thank you for mentioning that he was on a ventilator he was not doing well the fires around the hills of jerusalem they're just wiping out acre after acre after acre the question is now saying now will will jerusalem's hills ever recover from this kind of a fire it was closing in on the on the hospital they thought they were going to have to evacuate the rabbi and all the other people but god made a way and they were able to turn the fire back but he's still critical and needs to be remembered to the lord in prayer god's able amen let's take all these needs to the lord [Music] we love you we worship and adore you we glorify thy name in all the earth we give you glory lord [Music] we glorify thy name in all things we glorify thy name we glow thy name in all [Music] thy name hallelujah we glorify thy name [Music]

glow refine thy name hallelujah we glorify thy name what an honor to be invited to come into the holy of holies into into your heart and you made a way with your own blood [Music] and you gave us your own name and behind that name is all the authority of god and we pray oh god for those that are in need of infusion into their body of your life to raise them up and so we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ that you would raise them up for rabbi friedman in jesus name touch his body for sister pam hendrix raise her up fill her lung with your life and with your spirit [Music] everybody in this room touch their physical body that the life of god that is within them raise up i speak to that life in the name of jesus raise up in jesus name [Music] but most of all for all of us like i pray almost every day oh god give me the grace [Music] to surrender to you to know you and to follow you give us the understanding lord that we need in this particular hour where we come from who we are why we're here where we're going to know our father [Music] i can truly say like the song was saying that there's no one that has touched my heart like you have done [Music] oh god you promised an overcoming anointing and so we just take that in faith the anointing for this age for the sons and daughters of god it's your life in your sons and so we just claim it by faith and i just bless your people today in jesus name with the grace that is needed for all of their needs i just bless you i just bless you and honor you thank you for life thank you for your love and thank you for choosing us

want you to give the lord a hand clap of praise [Applause] hallelujah the lamb is worthy [Music] he's so worthy today [Music] you may be seated this morning it's wonderful to see you in the house of the lord we certainly recognize that some of you are not able to be here but you are here anyway we will say for the sake of the video you are out of quarantine but you are not 100 we acknowledge that we understand that and we give god praise for your faith and for you fighting your way to the house of god and i know that it honors the lord and i know that he will touch you because of that sacrifice i heard the prophet say today that we must be faithful we must push through everything that stands in our way we must be faithful to god and his house he said if you didn't believe that i know there are many of you who wouldn't be here today so may god bless you we will do our best to minister god's word to you and then let you go home and take your rest we understand that that is a very important part of this process i remember what it felt like to have good days and bad days and i don't want to say anything over you because everybody is different but i can tell you that three months later i could still have a bad day everything good everything good for all week and it just hit me sister beth is shaking her head they don't understand that part of the virus they don't understand why it does that way but as long as some of that remains in your system it can do that but we know that god can drive every bit of it out of your body for the grace of god we appreciate it we weren't sick this time but we got a lot of sympathy anyway in that something we had so many people text us and say we dropped the ball we had no idea what it felt like when you all were sick and we dropped the ball we wish we could go back and do it over again we would have at least called a little more there were those who took precious care of us and we thank you for that sister kathy was the first to arrive at the porch with all kinds of things to help us i pray that you have had what you needed we've tried to help or at least offer to help as many of you as we possibly could we know that others have been there to help you we know that some of you could have been in the hospital but god's grace kept you home we know that sister elfrida refused to stay they tried to keep her she had to sign her way out but she just signed her way out she went to the she went to the greely sick house [Laughter] and uh well i may or may not have seen a picture but i won't go into any details this morning but they were all under the weather and sister joyce had to to still try to take care of them as she could and make them breakfast and do things but they just were sick together and god made a way and as soon as they dropped sister elfrida off and she could get in her car she drove up here and she wanted to testify to me of the miracle that god had performed in her life she is not 100 like most who are here but she knows that god has done a work and has brought her through we're believing the lord to finish that work for so many of you i know it's hard on menfolk i know it's particularly hard on them they're not used to being down they're they're used to working they're used to doing what needs to be done and sometimes it strikes them particularly hard but we know that god's going to bring every one of them through with the victory and i'm not kidding when i tell you this church is blessed and i i hesitated i had been hesitating to say anything much about it in the streams but the lord rebuked me and he said don't you be afraid to give me praise for bringing you through and so i said lord forgive me that wasn't my intention but we ought to give him praise i texted brother steve polk one day and he was already back to work and he said he called me right back he said hold on a minute brother shelly and i held on a minute and he just raised up the biggest old roar you've ever heard in your life praising the lord he said you hear that that's what god has done and do you know he's worthy he is worthy to be praised and we thank him for it let's let me hurry along here with a few things that we want to mention tomorrow is ashley's birthday and we don't uh see her just now but she's here somewhere we want to wish her a happy birthday and uh may god bless her and she's going through a little something at work but god's grace is going to make a way for her we're just trusting the lord in all things brother richard i know you've been through it and you're here today i looked up when i first got here didn't see you but i was glad to look up later and see you and tomorrow is your birthday you've got a birthday tomorrow too kind of a big one kind of a big to do uh god's complete number right with a zero on the end so that you just just dropped the zero you're seven years old right let's just wish him a happy birthday grace of god just the grace of god and then tomorrow is brother i think it's tomorrow could be the next day is brother donovan and sister audrey's a wedding anniversary we want to pray for them lift them up to the lord brother george smith has a birthday on thursday we like to pray for brother george he came through it some while back and he he got a bit critical there but god helped him and on saturday is martha west's birthday so we want to hold her up to the lord believe that god will touch her as of this morning uh you have given toward the principal eight 126 and thirty two dollars and forty eight cents shouldn't we give god some praise for that [Applause] and uh you know when we started this process brother greeley told you up front in march that if there came a time that we got in a situation where we had to redirect that we would let you know and i'm only here to tell you this quickly and that is we will not be able to make the regular monthly payment in addition to the principal payments that we have been making this month we are a little bit low and that is simply because of the delay in the online giving so the payment is made but that is not an additional payment and uh we normally make a 4100 payment extra above and beyond what you give toward the principle we will not be able to do that just now but as soon as we can uh we would like to do that because that just keeps dropping it down now of that 4 100 payment that we make every month the principal is getting higher and the interest is getting lower so this month's principal out of the 41 the principal portion of that was 2 357 and 2 cent so we can say that we're over half over half toward that payment from that payment over half of it now is going toward the principle so god is good if you feel led to help us in in some way then you you can certainly do that but but you people have done that again and again and i know our business is going out all over the internet but it's really we don't really have a private time to talk to you do we so this is what it is if you're able this morning i'd like to ask you to stand for the word i won't make any additional comments while you're standing i would like for you to thank god for all of our help we had this morning and our musicians and backup singers cameramen and sound people and we're so glad to have r.j and hawk and enoch home and a little baby bump is showing this morning and we give god praise for that wonderful to see them as a church body we want to as our really our first service back we do want to say to sister joyce that you're still in our prayers every day we haven't forgotten that you are still hurting and we know that your dad is hurting and in need physically and also your family there that is labored so hard we're still asking god to strengthen them and encourage them loss is a difficult thing deuteronomy chapter 30 this morning i want to read two verses we want to welcome all of you streaming we see you all across bc canada obasi ghana cape town south africa johannesburg south africa and even greetings from the bride church in pakistan in uk and it goes on god bless every one of you see i have this is deuteronomy 30 15 and 16 see i have set before thee this day life and good and death and evil do you recognize a choice is being presented isn't it in that i command thee this day to love the lord thy god to walk in his ways and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments that thou mayest live and multiply and the lord thy god shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it a promise directly made to the children of the promise the children of israel the hebrew people but it's our promise as the royal and spiritual seed of abraham we also have a promised land and we're on our way to that promised land even this morning can you say amen one more place before we take our seat and that is hebrews chapter 10. and we're going to read a lot of scripture in the next few services so if you've got a real bible with you or or you have one you still own one bring it with you because you might want to underline a verse you might want to mark something hebrews 10 verse 28 and 29 he that despised moses law died without mercy under two or three witnesses i think that's an important verse i think it's important for you to know that in the time of moses there were those who despised the instruction who died and were punished for their for their denial for their rebellion for their sin everybody didn't trust the covenant that god had made everybody didn't follow the prophet that god had raised up and some lost their lives and they lost their eternal reward because of it now the apostle goes on to say of how much more sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden underfoot the son of god and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified set apart an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace i need to read it again of how much sorrow punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden underfoot the son of god and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace father we thank you this morning for the spirit of grace we thank you for the spirit of holiness we thank you for the spirit of adoption we thank you for the spirit of truth and we thank you for the spirit of life this is all by the holy ghost working in the believer even right now how we thank you for your word how it is unfolding how you are answering the questions of our heart and how you are giving us faith to exercise the word and now we need you to come and strengthen your people from the top of their head to the souls of their feet we pray that the anointing of the holy spirit would touch every cell we pray lord that you would touch every system we ask that your breath your life would go down through the respiratory systems of their body and that you would restore even damage that has happened because of this virus multiply good and healthy cells we speak to the fatigue to the weakness to the weariness to the heaviness physically and even spiritually that can hang on after coming through a trauma like this pandemic and we decree and declare in the name of the lord jesus christ that there will be restoration and not only restoration but we speak that there will be restitution to everybody who has experienced this time lord you are speaking we are a prophetic people this is a prophetic hour you are a god of the

hamashiach in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen and the saint said amen you may be seated this morning those of you that have strength use it support your pastor and support the word and fill in for those who aren't able to do it this morning amen they would if they could now we are for in to our study last week the spirit of holiness we are moving this morning into number five of the seven offices of the holy ghost the spirit of grace we may come back tuesday night and finish a portion that we missed on the spirit of holiness but i felt like that it is by the spirit of grace that we are gathered here today and i thought that we should declare it just declare it we're here by grace we have come this far leaning on the lord are you with me trusting in his holy word he's never failed us to this point we have no reason to believe he will fail us in the future he's going to be faithful the question is not whether or not god is going to be faithful the question is are you are you going to be faithful i have to ask myself am i going to be faithful not just when it's convenient but in all things faithful to him he's a good god he's a good god we're just going to do just a moment of review here in the in the brief explanation of these spirits that we have covered thus far number one we preached on the spirit of life the purpose of the holy ghost functioning in you as the spirit of life is to create or to recreate god's divine life in you the spirit of life by the holy ghost is present in the believer to create or recreate god's divine life in us that sounds good to me number two the spirit of truth by the holy ghost brings us to a more perfect revelation of god and his word number three the spirit of adoption works patiently in us how many of you are glad for the patiently part he works patiently in us why how would he know how would he know that he has to be patient because god lived in a body of flesh god lived in a body with mind will and emotions god lived in a body who fought the things that the average man or woman fights today so the spirit of adoption by the holy ghost works patiently in us until we can be called the sons of god or until we can be called the sons of knowledge those who have come all the way up into the fullness of who god is and his word and then we covered the spirit of holiness and the spirit of holiness by the holy ghost causes our relationship to grow into the realization and the revelation of his holiness if it were not for the spirit of holiness working in you by the holy ghost you would never be able to catch a glimpse of who he is and how he is holy he is holy he's holy he's holy there's nothing in him that's not holy there's nothing he says that's not holy there's nothing he does that is not holy he is the highest holiness and so we glimpse that we catch that because there's a spirit of holiness working in us by the holy ghost now we come to the spirit of grace if you want to write this we come to the spirit of grace and the spirit of grace is working in us by the holy ghost to govern our attitudes to govern our attitudes and actions to govern the attitude and the actions of the believer who are learning to walk by the spirit and not by the flesh we're still learning we're still learning to walk by the spirit we have to make choices every day amen i just had all kinds of texts i just had all kinds of things happen the last three weeks can i share them will it offend you if if yours is mentioned i just had all kind of communication from people one day i don't know what the shift was but one day i had three people in 10 minutes texting me and say are you worried [Music] it's out of the blue are you worried can i just ask you don't tell me can i what would you like for me to answer someone's feeling a little uneasy and they text their pastor and they say brother shelly are you worried what do you want me to say [Music] well what if i'm worried thank you for helping me thank you for having me what am i supposed to say if i am worried i can't lie so you know what i had to do i had to pray i feel i feel a little worn out myself this morning not like you i know but i'd be a little worn out i wonder if he gets tired of hearing from us because i had to i had to pray hard because i didn't want to worry because i didn't know if the next day i'd get the same text and i'd have to answer again i'm not worried and you know what he kicked in oh thank you lord only two times did the enemy overcome my mind for just a short period of time he overcome me for just a few minutes and then the holy ghost kicked in and i began to to speak and prophesy and got in the vehicle and rode up and down the roads and prayed over people's houses and believed that god would bring you through because really worrying didn't help us and i know we're human beings and when worry comes we have to do you have to do what i have to do you got to say but lord i know your word is right when you get texts that say so-and-so doesn't know me so-and-so is so confused they don't even know who i am what would you say how would you feel we're human beings aren't we and so our mind starts getting a little bit ahead of us and we have to stop that and we have to say wait a minute oh no devil you know i refuse to sing some of the lyrics this is no reflection on benjamin's songs this morning but i refuse to send some of those to sing some of those lyrics this morning there was a line in there and i may need to sing it next sunday but i said not today there was a line in that beautiful song that we sung toward the end that said my soul is barren and dry i couldn't sing that today i may sing that tuesday i may have to say that next sunday but if you've been praying like i'm praying you can't have a barren soul because the longer you stay connected to him the more your even your soul begins to get connected to what the spirit is saying and so just remember that when you get weary and you get weak and you begin to worry and you begin to wring your hands and you begin to cross bridges that you haven't come to yet you've got to catch yourself you've got to say wait a minute that is not who i am i'm not here just this is not some kind of jackpot i'm not i don't have my hand on a one-armed devil i'm not trying to gamble at a slot machine to see if i'm going to overcome this stuff or not this is no this is we're not throwing uh some card game or playing some kind of roulette will here we know that there's a divine god a god who has placed his divine life in us and even when we feel like death we don't have to receive it as a spirit from him because the spirit of life is in us we may not get up and run around the room and shout and speak in tongues but you're blessed to know that you've got a body you've got a family in christ that was doing that on your behalf because we knew that god wanted to bring you through well then why don't i feel 100 right now because your body hadn't caught up to your confession or either you're not making the right confession so don't text me this afternoon and ask me if i'm worried text me this afternoon and tell me where your faith is i'm coming out of this without a hiccup i'm not going to have a bad day three months from now come on we don't compare one case to another case [Music] this is no competition here in the early days i heard a few people say things like i think i've got it worse than anybody else that's how you feel that's how you feel when you're in the throw of it but let me tell you there's somebody laying in a hospital today that had you beat that is not to diminish what you went through it's actually to celebrate you it's actually to tell you that you somehow held on when it didn't feel like you didn't feel like holding on you somehow held on and god is let's just make it a process god is bringing you through for his glory everything you need to overcome is in you this morning by the power of the holy ghost if you should get worn out tonight remember there's grace for that there's rest for that there's help for that there's strength for that yes the truth is i worry but i have i don't have the luxury of laying there along i can't i cannot it's my responsibility as a pastor it's my responsibility as a pastor to get out of that place as quickly as i possibly can come on now so i know sometimes people are offended by my answers because you want me to see it as serious at the moment as you do but if that's what we all did where what a faith what a faith this wonderful thing about being married you're two different people coming together in a god call if you're too much alike it's going to be more rocky i need a little help here you've got two different people coming together and hopefully that helps because when one is reacting one way the other one can have the grace to react another way when one is low hopefully somebody in the house is high and vice versa and hopefully you swap around and you keep believing there's no shame in being sick don't you feel shamed don't you feel like that you're you weren't as robust as you thought you were or or the enemy got one over on you that's a lie i don't believe that doctrine if god allowed that thing to touch our body he did it because he wants to talk to us he did it because he has something to say to us somebody said now you tell me what god could say to me when i feel like i feel real bad you tell me what god can say to me i'll tell you what he can say he can say you can't make it without me all your vitamins and all your medications and all your doctor's appointments and all your frequency adjusters and everything else you do and all your juice none of that is going to help you without me if i'm not involved if i'm not on board come on now all the chelation therapy and all the all of the uh oh you know people are having fecal transplants where they're taking waste out of somebody's body and cleansing it and putting it somewhere else in somebody else's body and it resets their digestive system it's really a modern miracle if you think about it but i don't want to think about it you can go through all that kind of therapy and go through all that kind of help and it won't be enough and sometimes god just wants you to remember you can make it by yourself you can drink gallons of oil and you can't make it by yourself you can take so much vitamin c you can only live in one room of the house but you can't make it without my help sometimes that's what he's saying you know what else god was saying to some of us don't be mad don't be mad to some of us he was saying oh it's good to hear from you again stephen who i'm using my name david you weren't sick this time david who he wants to hear from us somebody said god doesn't want to hear from us when things are bad let me tell you the truth he wants to hear from you all the time good time bad time he wants to hear from you when you need him and when you don't need him he wants to hear from you that's how much he loves you so so don't tell me he's not talking he's talking and we're listening and he makes sure we listen sometimes because we don't have energy to do anything else when we're fighting something like this i bless you in the name of the lord i celebrate your faithfulness i honor you for being in the house of god today my heart goes out to those who would have liked to have been here this morning but felt too weak to be here may god raise them up may they not have to miss another time that they would want to be here i don't feel any judgment for anybody i feel like god's doing something and i just want to say blessed be the name of the lord i want to thank god i want to thank him i want to thank him for how gracious he's been this spirit of grace we've got to move on the spirit of grace governs the attitudes and the actions of the believer who has learned to walk in the spirit and not in the flesh not by the realm of the soul but by the realm of the spirit we need the spirit of grace i want you to think with me a moment here as an introduction to this spirit of grace because we're mostly familiar with just calling it grace but two times in the bible one old testament one new testament it's not just called grace it's called the spirit of grace i don't know what you think about when you think about grace most people think about unmerited favor is that what comes to your mind let me see your hand if you think of that as a good definition for grace it's a good it's a good theological definition but what is grace is it ethereal is it like a mist if somebody says i feel grace what did you feel how does grace feel is grace an inanimate object is it an object when someone says there go i but by the grace of god what do they mean is grace something that you consume like a pie is grace an emotion you ever thought of grace as a person how many of you remember the story that and we may read it in a moment or two do you remember the story that brother branham tells about dwight moody maybe you'll just bring that up for me is it okay to do things out of order good i'm more comfortable that way it's in a message the invisible union of the bride of christ paragraph 37 it was said one time i was reading when i was writing a note for this i i could not exactly remember the book that it's in but i i'm sure this is right that one of the books i read on mr moody dwight moody in chicago we have a great listening church in chicago how many of you know he's talking about the great radio station that came out of the moody chapel in in chicago illinois for so many years he said that mr moody after reading romans 7 ran into the street and the first man he met he said to him do you know grace and the man replied grace who you got to get it hey you know grace grace who mr moody said the grace of god so it so thrilled him when he seen what how grace had separated us from the law and how that what part grace played well now anything that i want to do is when i always told the people when i crossed the line on the other side i'd like to stand up and sing amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me gracious precious grace more of grace to know for it's by grace we are saved that what is grace what is grace is grace something you meet like you meet a person is grace something you feel like an emotion is grace like a mist a cloud is it a feeling he said for it's by grace we're saved not by what we can do what we can whatever we do is not counted to us grace is what saves us by grace are you saved through faith how many of you know this is right he said may i add to this woman grace brother branham is personifying grace he's describing as moody did grace as a person he's describing a solomon did wisdom he is personifying grace he's making her a woman although i'm having a hard time finding any verses that refer to grace in the same manner that wisdom is referred to but listen at how he went on here he said may i place her in the bible also as called the elect lady who is the elect lady she is the bride she is the portion of the church that the message was sent to to the elect lady we read it in the book of the revelation perhaps another place to the elect lady let me address these words to the elect lady who is she she's the overcoming bride [Music] there is a message sent to the church there is a message sent to the overcoming bride the church is not the elect lady the bride is the elect lady brother brethren said let me take this grace and place her in the bible also as called the elect lady this miss grace can you see anything yet he said i'm going to talk about you know the bible declare said to the elect lady that if you notice elect comes from the word elected lady one lady amongst all the other ladies was elected there were many other birds but there was only one great speckled bird all the other birds flocked against her they envied her glory and her fame they long defined fault with the prophet's teachings but theologians could find no mistake among all the birds there was a great speckled bird there was one elect lady there was one chosen among all the other ladies he says in paragraph 41 like the virgin was to bring forth the body of god on the earth she was an elected woman god chose mary we could say today that mary was miss grace because she was chosen by grace and that grace was personified and she became the personification i don't know if you feel up to following me this morning but she became the personification of the very thing that brought her through she became a misgrace like the virgin was to bring forth the body of god the body of the lord jesus christ on the earth she was an elected woman god chose mary let's read on just a bit and also god has chose an elected lady which is his bride come on now same way he chose mary he's chosen elected lady abroad she's elected i hope we're members of that tonight across the world across the nation rather he's even on the hook up the telephone hookup is operating then and he said across the nation rather the illustration here are you still with me showing the relationship of the bride to christ the elect lady and how she was to be brought to him where she would come from and how that she would be brought to him somebody tell me what was doing this it was grace it was grace that found us in our denominational error and told us there was something else it was grace that wouldn't allow us to be satisfied forever in partial truth because he had a truth that he wanted to reveal and make known to us you may feel like you chose to follow this message but the truth is this message chose you this truth chose you you were elected and chosen of god to follow a message of truth that would reveal jesus christ as the same yesterday today and forever so if mary was a misgrace then there is a bride on the earth even now who also is becoming the personification of grace do you know grace yes i know her yes i know her i'm looking at her i'm looking at miss grace i'm looking at what grace has done he said the illustration here showing the relationship of bride to christ the elect lady 1241 and how she was to be brought to him where she would come from and how that she would be brought to him all of this grace grace grace grace let's go on the church the church here in illustration that we get that we've got in view is illustrated by a woman which a woman is always a type of the church because the church is considered a bride a bride she is the bride of the lord jesus the son of god next verse i didn't want to leave this out next paragraph i mean always if you watch watch the conditions and the conduct of women [Music] this is hard to get out there on the on the internet but it's the truth and you'll see where the church is how many of you know it's right watch the condition and the conduct of women in any generation and you will be able to identify the condition and conduct of the church because a church is represented by a woman when you see women wanting to strip off when you see women wanting to do the things that modern women want to do today you understand no wonder the church has lost its power like samson the church laid her head in delilah's lap he cut off her strength and power and now she's weak and she accomplishes very little in this hour a lot of noise a lot of programs a lot of social justice issues but not much jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever so god said i got to do something with the people i've got to infuse them with grace so that they become a personification of what grace is and if you're not following me you will you will eventually because we'll come back to this i've got to have a people who will personify the spirit of grace and listen church that doesn't start with you and the world that starts with you and your fellow brother and your fellow sister in christ that starts with you and the members of your church community it's learning to personify grace to one another never quit to put somebody to hell but always believing that grace is enough my that's a that's a that's a we came in amen brother but always believing that like goodness and mercy grace will chase down the wayward one he will find the prodigal son he will find the prodigal daughter because god is looking for someone to be grace to personify grace jesus is love and he personifies love jesus is grace and he personifies grace so let me tell you what grace is it's more than an abstract something you can't see you just say grace has brought me thus far and what does that mean you had a feeling you had some energy you had something come on you and that was what brought you through is that what grace is no grace is more than that grace is a spirit grace is a spirit the spirit of grace and the apostle is saying if those people who rejected the law of moses and who rejected the salvation by moses the truth that moses brought to bring the people out if they did not go without punishment how much greater will the punishment be to those of us who had opportunity to be a part of a new covenant purchased by the blood of the sinless lamb of god and how much more will we find rejection and will we face punishment if we walk on jesus and if we show disrespect to the spirit of grace i want you to see the spirit of grace if truth is a spirit if life is a spirit if adoption is a spirit if holiness is a spirit then grace is also a spirit and someone said who does it live in you as a believer how many believers are here let me see your hand if you're a believer what do believers do they believe that was often my answer i'm believing one person got very very specific how worried are you let me see if i can measure it how do you answer that i'm i'm 30 worried and 70 faith the truth is there's just no room concern is not what we're talking about we're talking about worry if you're talking about concern i'm 100 concerned but when i found worry creeping in i had to deal with it and you will too because worry is like acid [Music] it erodes it's like a cancer it's like fear it eats away in your faith it thrives on faith like moths thrive on wool it wants to eat and consume and poke holes in everything you try to do to keep pressing on and to keep believing but i want to tell you something if you say you have the baptism of the holy ghost then all that he is is resonant in your life and if you'll get in touch with the spirit of life get in touch with the spirit of truth get in touch with the spirit of adoption and get in touch with the spirit of holiness get in touch with the spirit of grace it's in you if the holy ghost is there then all of his offices are there if the holy ghost is there then all of his ministries are there all of his administrations are there well we got something church we have something we have somebody when you sing the old hymn i have somebody with me you've got more than just a friend on board you've got everything you have need of this good old holy ghost do you know grace turn to your neighbor and ask him do you know grace grace who amazing grace how sweet the sound and it's not a feeling it's not some kind of cloud it's not an object it's a spirit it's his spirit living inside of you grace doesn't have to come running after you because grace lives in you you just have to reach in and touch it now not only do you have to learn to show grace to others you have to learn to show grace to yourself at times because god didn't just put grace in you to help you overcome and forgive somebody else he also placed the spirit of grace in you so that you'd be able to show your own self grace because jesus is the one who gave it to you and he's not taking it back if anybody's with me can you say amen i got about 10 minutes here of what i of the time i wanted to take so i better get to it we said in the beginning of this introduction that the spirit of grace in you as the holy ghost desires to govern our lives so that he can fulfill all the purposes of god in you individually and in us corporately folks we really have no excuse i'm not getting much out of the preaching lately that's just no excuse i'm not defending myself i'm telling you the truth it's not much of an excuse if you have the holy ghost you've got everything you need to lead you to grace and truth it's inside we need a preaching because god has chosen the foolishness of preaching we need all of these gifts in the body the apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists we need those gifts because we are facing that until we want to walk in that until the fullness of what's on the other side of the until now what does govern mean the spirit of grace is given to the believer to help govern you i rented to you hall while you were sick i've never drove a u-haul truck in my life i had r.j sitting beside me in case i needed him i kind of liked it i had fun i went out there near where the graves live and rented a u-haul and drove back ways over there to opelaka auburn to pick up something and drove over here to the church and then drove it back through town and took it back and i kind of liked the feel of that thing it's big i kind of liked the idea of people getting out of my way it wasn't that big but i felt pretty big and it sat pretty comfortable thing but they knew me and they knew that if i get to talking my foot can get a little heavy and i started down one of them hills out there on highway 80. i thought the thing was going to shut down and stop i thought somebody was about to take the wheel and pull it over and and switch it off because something kicked on in there to slow me down the concept of what we used to call a governor the governor stepped in come on and he said you're going too fast in this thing you're swerving around when we got out uh ben benjamin and joshua and them and followed us and i said how did i do they said well it was kind of swerving i said yeah i know it was i was well aware of the swerve that's kind of what i liked that thing governed me i was ready to go full throttle down that hill and up the other side it was empty and i was enjoying my power until somebody stepped in and said whoa it wasn't necessarily conviction i wasn't going a hundred you know that they don't let you i wasn't even gonna flat stretch it was going down the hill that i'd gained all that speed and literally it felt like the whole thing was sure it wouldn't even let me press the pedal all the way down this is a work of the holy ghost it's the spirit of grace god is being gracious to you when he puts the governor on when he slows you down i wish you could squeeze out some help for me just a moment it's a work of the holy ghost and the spirit of grace to govern us in our attitudes and in our actions when we get to flying down the hill lickety-split like a runaway train it'll take us where we don't want to go it'll dredge up emotions that we have long buried it will remind us as emotions begin to resurface and memories begin to reform thank you lord for the spirit of grace that steps in to govern us he doesn't control us he doesn't stop us he governs us grace grace governs us i thought the thing might switch off that would have been stopping me that would have been like a real work of conviction but that's not what this was this was god not saying stop this was god saying you need to slow way down you're not in control of what's happening right now hello what'd you think was doing that i'm not a betting person but i would almost be willing to tell you you didn't think it was grace it doesn't feel like grace when god slows us down but it's grace because you realize what would happen if he just stood back and said go ahead fly off the cliff go ahead and make a real f-o-o-l of yourself come on go ahead show who you really no no he doesn't do that great amazing grace how sweet the sound it rises up in us and says whoa i'm here to govern you i'm here to restrain you a little i'm here to hold you back i'm here to give you some time to reflect on what's going on so that you don't destroy yourself or destroy somebody else around you i want you to appreciate grace let me tell you something the next time you get up and sing amazing grace you're not just singing about the grace that saved you or the grace that brought you out of sin i want you to begin to recognize you're also praising him for the grace that keeps you [Music] i think it was spurgeon it might have been moody that used to preach there were three or four kinds of grace there was a preeminent grace a grace that came to you in your life to protect you until god could deal with you and then a saving grace and then a keeping grace and then a finishing grace i don't know if you can divide it up into categories or not but i'm going to let you know for the sake of a time i'm not going to do that because it could end up being a three-month series but all of its grace the grace that kept you when you were out there come on now somebody snorting something up their nose and wasn't real sure where it come from swallowing something and not real sure who made it you didn't catch a glimpse of a dirty old shack somewhere where that stuff was being cooked up and made might be laced with rap poison might be laced with something else might be contaminated by something you're just out there in sin you've never called on the lord you've never found him amazing grace hasn't saved you yet and yet god protected some of us that's what grace was doing for you before you knew who she was grace was on your side hallelujah before you ever recognized you needed her come on protecting you keeping you some of you in violent places you could have been shot some of you beat up don't raise your hand there's some of you that have carried a black eye fractured nose a crooked jaw because of being in an atmosphere that fist could have easily been a a bullet come on let's celebrate it could have been a bullet that took you out of this world but grace was already ministering the spirit of grace was already working on your behalf before you were filled with grace before you had received the holy ghost he was already out there working on your behalf and then grace saved you grace found you you didn't go looking for grace grace come looking for you and you were saved and born again by faith in the marvelous grace of the lord jesus christ and that's wonderful grace but i want you to know that i thank god for that grace but i thank him more than anything else for keeping grace i wasn't on drugs when i found the lord i never smoked a joint i never took speed i never was never even in the room where someone was snorting cocaine i i needed grace because i was still a sinner and undone without god an amazing grace found me and it was a if it hadn't been for that i would be lost because it's not what you're doing it's the fact you've rejected away you haven't come to the to trust the lord for his life and i had not as a child i remember singing and praying in the little baptist sunday school and accepting the lord into my life and he filled me with the holy ghost at age seven and i've made a lot of mistakes in my life but that wasn't one of them i i didn't drink or smoke or run around i was sexually pure when i married my wife and but i can testify to you today of the keeping grace because jesus didn't just save you like you were find you like you were he's kept you on the winning side how many of you think you ought to take a moment just to raise up your hand and say lord i thank you for grace oh come on church somebody we're getting ready to go here why don't you do great thank you lord for great why don't you sitting in your home right now or on the other side of the world why don't you just raise up your hand and say lord i thank you for grace i thank you for the spirit of grace it's operating in my life hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah without the spirit of grace in your life we cannot live up to our profession without the spirit of grace in our lives we cannot copy the example of our beloved master without the spirit of grace in our lives we cannot keep his commandments without the spirit of grace in our lives we cannot love one another as he has loved us without the spirit of grace we cannot sympathize with lost sinners as we should without the spirit of grace we cannot keep god's glory in view in all that we say and do without the spirit of grace we cannot walk in high in holy fellowship with god without the spirit of grace we cannot meet death one day with peace and joy i want you to know the spirit of grace is active in every facet of our life each and every day and we need to honor that spirit of grace we need to give thanks to god for the spirit of grace the one that saved us the one that keeps us the one that's helped get us through so many difficult times of our life including the coronavirus aren't we blessed musicians are coming two minutes over what i wanted to do this morning thank god for grace i want to preach this and teach this over the next services i want to make it so real to you i want you to know that you can't get up in the morning with jesus on your mind unless the spirit of grace is operating in your life you can't go to bed at night with jesus on your mind unless the spirit of grace is operating in your life you can't enter into worship unless the spirit of grace is operating in your life you can't keep a positive attitude unless the spirit of grace is operating in your life come on now i'm telling you what the bride we got to quit i want to say this i mentioned it earlier but i won't say it again this little bride around the world we've got to quit worrying about bridges we haven't come to yet how are we going to get across something we haven't even come to yet we don't have time listen we don't have time we don't have time to get caught up in the world of worry over something that we don't even know whether we're going to have to face it or not you know how in the enemy introduces that what if what if what if what if what if what if what if what if what if whatever whatever it if you know you're not in control of what ifs do you realize that this drives people into such insanity sometimes they can't leave their homes because of what if what if i leave my home and i get killed by a tractor-trailer truck well i can say something to fix that what if you're sitting in your recliner and a tree falls on your hand or an airplane falls out of the sky and strikes you on the porch what if come on while you can get caught up in this world and get so far away from the confession and profession of a christian you'll sound like somebody already lost
