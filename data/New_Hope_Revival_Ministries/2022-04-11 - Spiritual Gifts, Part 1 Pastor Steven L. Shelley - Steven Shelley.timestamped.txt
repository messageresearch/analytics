[29:32] the kind of faith it
[29:34] [Music]
[29:39] under the takes
[29:40] waves
[29:42] to step out of my comfort zone
[29:45] into the realm of the unknown where
[29:48] jesus is
[29:51] and he's holding out his hair
[29:54] and the wings are calling out my name
[29:57] and they laugh at me
[30:00] they're reminding me of all the times
[30:04] i've tried
[30:07] and before waves they keep on telling me
[30:10] just time and time again before you'll
[30:14] never win
[30:15] no
[30:16] you'll never win
[30:21] but the voice of truth tells me a
[30:25] different story
[30:27] the voice of true
[30:30] says do not be afraid
[30:33] in the voice of truth
[30:36] says this is for my glory
[30:39] out of all the voices calling out to me
[30:44] [Music]
[30:45] oh i will choose to listen and believe
[30:51] [Music]
[31:02] do
[31:04] [Music]
[31:14] surrounded by the sounds of a thousand
[31:17] warriors just to shaking in their armor
[31:22] just a wishing they'd have had the
[31:24] strength to stand
[31:26] but the giant's calling out my name and
[31:29] he laughs at me
[31:31] oh
[31:32] he's reminding me of all the times i've
[31:36] tried before and failed
[31:38] and the giant keeps on telling me for
[31:42] time and time again
[31:46] [Music]
[31:54] it tells me a different story
[31:58] the voice of truth
[32:00] says do not be afraid
[32:04] and the voice of truth says this is for
[32:08] my glory
[32:09] out of all the voices calling out to me
[32:16] and i will choose to listen and believe
[32:19] the voice
[32:21] but the voice of truth tells me a
[32:25] different
[32:26] story the voice of truth
[32:30] says do not be afraid
[32:33] the voice of truth
[32:36] says this is for my glory
[32:39] the moon the voice is calling out to me
[32:43] i will choose
[32:45] i will choose to listen and believe the
[32:49] voice of true
[32:51] i want us to take just a moment
[32:54] and i want you to think about what
[32:56] you're singing this morning
[32:58] because as sure as we're gathered here
[33:00] in the name of the lord there are voices
[33:02] in your head
[33:04] and they're telling you all kinds of
[33:06] things
[33:07] and that enemy will come to church with
[33:09] you and he'll sit through the service
[33:11] with you and he'll go home with you and
[33:14] he'll go to work with you and he'll tell
[33:16] you constantly you'll never win
[33:19] you'll never live an overcoming
[33:21] christian life you don't have what it
[33:23] takes to live above sin
[33:25] but i want you to know he's a liar
[33:28] he's the father of all lies
[33:31] his lies go all the way back to the
[33:33] garden and he's defeated by the
[33:35] redemptive blood of the lord jesus
[33:37] christ
[33:38] and i want you to know that god if if
[33:41] if this was his plan he could override
[33:44] that
[33:45] and he could force you to believe him
[33:48] but that is not the way he created this
[33:50] universe he gave you and i the ability
[33:54] to make that choice and we don't make it
[33:56] once and for all we make it once and for
[33:59] all and then we continue to make it over
[34:01] and over and over and over again
[34:04] i choose to listen to the voice of truth
[34:07] this morning i choose to believe that
[34:09] god is greater greater is he that is in
[34:12] me than he that is in the world i choose
[34:14] to believe that if i will stop trying so
[34:17] hard and let him live this life through
[34:20] me that i will be able to live a
[34:23] successful testimony of the grace of the
[34:25] lord jesus so i want us to sing that
[34:28] verse again because i love that part
[34:31] about all the israeli army
[34:35] and every one of them
[34:37] every one of them would have liked to
[34:39] have been a david
[34:41] every one of them would have liked to
[34:43] have had that strength that day but god
[34:46] had placed his anointing on david
[34:49] and the rest of them were standing there
[34:50] shaking in their army
[34:53] ready to flee from the enemy but david
[34:56] had to go he had to go he had to go he
[34:59] had to be obedient he had to make a
[35:01] choice he had to listen to the voice of
[35:04] truth
[35:05] i want us to sing it again and i want
[35:07] you to make a choice again
[35:10] maybe you made it when you woke up this
[35:12] morning
[35:13] maybe you made it earlier in the worship
[35:15] but i want you to make a choice again to
[35:17] listen to the voice of truth
[35:19] to silence the voices of the enemy that
[35:22] will tell you all kinds of lies
[35:25] and choose to believe the one who said i
[35:28] am the truth
[35:29] i am the way i am the life
[35:32] we have to do it yes yes
[35:36] oh what i would do to have
[35:39] the kind of strength it takes to stand
[35:42] before a giant
[35:44] [Music]
[35:45] with just a sling and a stone
[35:49] surrounded by the sound of the thousand
[35:52] warriors just a shaking in their armor
[35:57] and wishing they'd have had the strength
[35:59] to stand
[36:01] but the giant's calling out my name and
[36:04] he laughs at me
[36:06] he's just reminding me of all those
[36:09] times i've tried before and failed
[36:13] but the child keeps on telling me just
[36:16] time and time again
[36:19] you'll never win
[36:21] no you'll never win
[36:27] but the voice of truth tells me a
[36:31] different story
[36:33] the voice of truth
[36:39] and the says of truth says this is for
[36:43] my glory
[36:45] out of all the voices calling out to me
[36:51] and i will choose to listen and believe
[36:55] the voice
[36:57] but the voice of truth tells me a
[37:01] different story
[37:03] the voice of truth
[37:06] says do not be afraid
[37:09] and the voice of truth
[37:12] says this is for my glory
[37:15] paul the voice is calling out to me
[37:20] [Applause]

[37:37] says do not be afraid
[37:40] and the voice of true
[37:43] says this is for my glory
[37:46] out of all the voices calling out to me

[56:20] [Applause]
[56:24] i plan to really see him
[56:27] face to face
[56:28] you may be seated
[56:30] this is what the word tells us and we
[56:33] believe it
[56:34] and i want to add my greetings to
[56:36] brother greeley and thank the visitors
[56:38] for being here today because we have so
[56:40] many of our home folks out
[56:42] and it's really nice
[56:45] to see someone sitting in their seats
[56:48] and uh we appreciate that we have come
[56:50] to glorify the lord
[56:53] uh
[56:55] conchita
[56:57] would you sing
[57:01] what if we brought you the mic
[57:08] i want you to know this
[57:10] i want you to know whether you do or not
[57:12] i'm i would love to have heard you i
[57:15] want you to know that
[57:17] she's got a real anointed voice
[57:20] written songs for the lord
[57:23] and i love her
[57:25] i love a lot of folks
[57:28] but you know when you get with somebody
[57:30] that has that kind of an anointing on
[57:32] them
[57:33] you appreciate it
[57:35] i'm so thankful that god
[57:38] calls us he doesn't leave us he doesn't
[57:41] forsake us he walks with us
[57:45] we had a wonderful celebration yesterday
[57:49] for the life of brother steve curry and
[57:51] i believe that he was pleased
[57:56] i believe that the lord would somehow
[57:58] allow him to know
[58:00] that he made a difference in so many
[58:02] people's lives
[58:05] and i want you to know that if
[58:06] circumstances would have been different
[58:08] the building would not have held the
[58:10] people that would have come and would
[58:12] have liked to have been there
[58:14] to give honor but the church the
[58:16] pentecostal church in lagrange was full
[58:19] and i didn't even know there was a
[58:21] balcony up there i thought that was a
[58:22] sound
[58:23] sound system at some time
[58:26] but come to find out there was a balcony
[58:28] up there and people were there and there
[58:29] was some standing up
[58:31] what i appreciate the most was the
[58:33] presence of the lord that was there from
[58:36] from start to finish
[58:38] and uh i truly believe that when a
[58:41] believer goes home they they don't just
[58:44] rest and you know lay around and do
[58:47] nothing like some people have this idea
[58:49] of soul sleep i don't believe in soul
[58:51] sleep i want you to know that
[58:53] i believe they join the great cloud of
[58:55] witnesses
[58:57] and i believe they are doing ministry
[58:59] from a different dimension it's a
[59:01] spiritual thing now and they're
[59:03] interceding
[59:05] and they're praying
[59:06] for you and i
[59:08] and i'm not catholic and i don't pray to
[59:11] the saints
[59:12] but i want you to know the bible said we
[59:14] are compassed about
[59:16] by such a great cloud of witnesses
[59:19] somebody asked me one time why would
[59:21] they care why would they even care they
[59:24] made it
[59:25] why would they even care what's going on
[59:28] down here well the bible said they
[59:30] without us the scripture said they
[59:33] without us are not complete
[59:35] it's vitally important for them that you
[59:38] and i run all the way
[59:42] because the truth is they're not going
[59:44] into the fullness i know that i know
[59:47] that church theology says all kinds of
[59:50] things
[59:51] and i know in our minds we would like to
[59:54] place our brother right at the feet of
[59:56] jesus
[59:57] and we know that he's there in the
[59:59] presence of the lord but the scripture
[1:00:02] says
[1:00:03] that the dead in christ shall rise first
[1:00:06] and we which are alive and remain shall
[1:00:09] be caught up together to meet them in
[1:00:11] the air and then we go and meet the
[1:00:14] fullness of who the lord is
[1:00:16] and so we believe that the righteous
[1:00:18] dead are in the presence of the lord
[1:00:21] where there is no worry there's no pain
[1:00:24] there's no trouble there's no bad
[1:00:26] reports
[1:00:27] there's no cancer there's no heart
[1:00:29] disease there's no headaches
[1:00:33] it's just joy
[1:00:35] all joy
[1:00:37] they're not becoming angels
[1:00:40] [Music]
[1:00:43] they're not coming back as cardinals
[1:00:49] or june bugs
[1:00:52] i knew somebody one time that said i
[1:00:54] would very much like to step on that bug
[1:00:57] this was somebody that ought to know
[1:00:58] better
[1:01:00] said i'd very much like to crush that
[1:01:02] bug but it might be a lost uncle or a
[1:01:04] lost aunt
[1:01:07] i said i'd like to step on you
[1:01:11] you surely don't think such a thing as
[1:01:13] that
[1:01:15] now i know that
[1:01:16] i know that what the lord will do is he
[1:01:18] will send signs to us
[1:01:21] and he'll send reminders to us of our
[1:01:23] loved ones
[1:01:24] and i know people that have seen
[1:01:26] butterflies and and felt the presence of
[1:01:28] their loved one i'm not against that
[1:01:31] but that butterfly is not our loved one
[1:01:33] that's just god kissing us and saying
[1:01:35] don't you forget
[1:01:37] anybody you mad at me
[1:01:39] i'm just telling you the truth
[1:01:42] i've been in the spirit in some of those
[1:01:44] heavenly places and i've never seen
[1:01:46] those babies with diapers playing harps
[1:01:52] people have in their mind is not exactly
[1:01:54] like it's going to be but i want you to
[1:01:56] know when we get there we're going to
[1:01:58] know it all
[1:02:00] everything is going to be revealed to us
[1:02:02] and we're going to know it and i want
[1:02:04] you to know that as much as our brother
[1:02:07] loved us
[1:02:09] as much as he loved us he would never be
[1:02:12] able to leave
[1:02:13] that atmosphere where he is now
[1:02:16] as much as he loved his family
[1:02:18] there's just nothing that compares with
[1:02:21] knowing the race is run
[1:02:24] just one whisper well done
[1:02:27] from the lips of the one you've served
[1:02:29] all these years
[1:02:31] i i appreciate
[1:02:33] sister green singing all these years so
[1:02:35] many times she sang the song
[1:02:38] it will be worth it all
[1:02:41] when we see jesus
[1:02:43] all of us trials and heartaches and
[1:02:46] sorrows will seem as nothing when we
[1:02:49] behold his beauty
[1:02:51] you may think it's just a fairy tale but
[1:02:53] i want you to know it's it's reality
[1:02:55] and it's more real than the air that you
[1:02:57] breathe right now
[1:02:59] heaven is not a fantasy it's a it's a
[1:03:02] reality it's actual
[1:03:04] it's literal
[1:03:05] and you and i are going to enjoy that
[1:03:07] one of these days if you believe that
[1:03:09] say amen
[1:03:11] so today is sister jaya's birthday hold

[1:04:30] the gentle winds were blowing my way
[1:04:36] not a storm cloud was inside

[1:04:48] a storm
[1:04:49] surrounded my life
[1:04:56] but even in the storm

[1:05:03] and here's the reason why

[1:10:37] hallelujah
[1:10:38] would you thank the musicians
[1:10:40] those who worked hard to bring us into
[1:10:42] god's presence this morning
[1:10:44] [Applause]
[1:10:47] especially zach with no sleep
[1:10:57] if you'll turn in your bible this
[1:10:58] morning do first corinthians chapter 12
[1:11:02] i i have a little bit different message
[1:11:04] for you this morning
[1:11:06] perhaps it's one that i i might not
[1:11:08] would normally bring when there are
[1:11:12] so many visitors among us but
[1:11:16] it's the bible
[1:11:18] it's coming right out of the word and
[1:11:21] we need it we're living in an hour
[1:11:24] where we need to be able to know what's
[1:11:25] moving around us
[1:11:28] we do we really do
[1:11:30] the enemy is out to
[1:11:32] seduce us deceive
[1:11:34] he would like to
[1:11:36] lie to us and cause us to believe a lie
[1:11:39] but jesus is the victory
[1:11:43] first corinthians chapter 12 verse 1.
[1:11:46] now concerning spiritual gifts brethren
[1:11:50] i would not have you
[1:11:54] ignorant
[1:11:57] paul believed that it was
[1:12:00] vitally important
[1:12:02] to instruct the church at corinth
[1:12:06] concerning spiritual gifts
[1:12:09] many times in the message of the hour
[1:12:12] we hear brother branham talking about
[1:12:14] the need to address
[1:12:17] the spiritual gifts and how they should
[1:12:20] operate in the body
[1:12:22] and he would often say something like
[1:12:24] this we're getting to that
[1:12:26] we're going to be talking about that
[1:12:28] we're going to lay that out
[1:12:30] because it was part of the restoration
[1:12:35] all things means all things
[1:12:38] and if god is going to restore divine
[1:12:41] healing
[1:12:42] if and he did he has
[1:12:44] then he would certainly take us all the
[1:12:46] way back to to everything
[1:12:49] that was functioning in the book of acts
[1:12:51] do you understand that
[1:12:53] so then if you'll look at first peter
[1:12:55] before you're seated chapter 4
[1:12:59] beginning in verse 10.
[1:13:03] first peter 4 and verse 10
[1:13:06] as every man hath received the gift
[1:13:11] even so minister the same
[1:13:14] one to another
[1:13:17] as good
[1:13:18] stewards
[1:13:20] of the manifold
[1:13:22] grace
[1:13:24] of god
[1:13:26] i don't know if you know it or not but
[1:13:28] the greek word
[1:13:31] charisma
[1:13:32] that is used for
[1:13:35] gift
[1:13:36] comes from the root word chris
[1:13:40] which is the greek word for grace
[1:13:43] so when we talk about spiritual gifts
[1:13:46] we're talking about an extension
[1:13:50] of god's grace to his church
[1:13:53] it's powerful
[1:13:55] to understand that
[1:13:57] verse 11 if any man speak
[1:14:00] let him speak as
[1:14:02] the oracles of god
[1:14:05] if any man minister
[1:14:07] let him do it as of the ability which
[1:14:10] god giveth
[1:14:12] that god in all things may be glorified
[1:14:16] through jesus christ to whom be praise
[1:14:19] and dominion forever and ever amen let
[1:14:23] me read that verse again if any man
[1:14:26] speak let him speak as the oracles of
[1:14:28] god
[1:14:30] if any man minister let him do it as of
[1:14:32] the ability which god giveth that god in
[1:14:36] all things may be glorified through
[1:14:39] jesus christ
[1:14:41] to whom be praise and dominion forever
[1:14:45] and ever
[1:14:46] amen which means so be it let's pray
[1:14:49] together father we thank you today for
[1:14:51] your presence
[1:14:53] you have not left us here to worship you
[1:14:56] without the witness of your spirit
[1:14:59] you have been here this morning and you
[1:15:02] have confirmed your presence among us
[1:15:05] and how we thank you for that i thank
[1:15:08] you for every victory that was on
[1:15:10] display
[1:15:11] i do i thank you for every person that
[1:15:14] moved out of their comfort zone to
[1:15:17] worship you this morning
[1:15:19] i i appreciate even those who ran
[1:15:23] i know that takes a lot some time
[1:15:26] but i think it is a celebration of
[1:15:28] victory
[1:15:30] and i thank you for giving victory to
[1:15:32] those precious ones
[1:15:34] who who moved out of their a place of
[1:15:37] confinement
[1:15:38] and i know there are those who may not
[1:15:40] understand but but i just asked lord
[1:15:42] that you would help us all to find a way
[1:15:45] to demonstrate our love
[1:15:47] our gratitude and our thankfulness for
[1:15:50] who you are and now lord we approach a
[1:15:53] very
[1:15:54] important subject for a few moments this
[1:15:56] morning and it may not be everybody's
[1:15:59] cup of tea
[1:16:00] but i ask that you would let there be
[1:16:02] something in this for every hungry heart
[1:16:06] i ask that you would give wisdom
[1:16:09] that you would give understanding that
[1:16:11] you would give revelation and that you
[1:16:14] would help us to see that you have
[1:16:17] placed the gifts of the spirit into your
[1:16:20] bride church
[1:16:23] to demonstrate your grace for us
[1:16:27] and we give honor to you
[1:16:29] and we remember that we were told that
[1:16:32] these are love gifts
[1:16:35] these are
[1:16:37] the very tokens of the bridegroom's love
[1:16:41] for his bride and i want to thank you
[1:16:44] for every bit of that and for every
[1:16:46] demonstration
[1:16:47] that you have given to us through the
[1:16:49] years we ask for your help in the name
[1:16:52] of the lord jesus christ and the church
[1:16:55] said
[1:16:56] amen you may be seated
[1:16:58] we are
[1:16:59] going to minister a little teaching this
[1:17:02] morning
[1:17:03] on
[1:17:04] not the gifts of the spirit
[1:17:07] the charismata
[1:17:08] but we're going to talk about one
[1:17:11] particular
[1:17:12] gift among the nine is that all right we
[1:17:16] can't do all nine
[1:17:18] in one service we can't even do justice
[1:17:21] to the one gift that the lord has laid
[1:17:23] on my heart to talk about we can't even
[1:17:26] do justice to that gift in one service
[1:17:29] but we will scratch the surface together
[1:17:33] because to me there is one gift that
[1:17:35] stands out above all the other gifts
[1:17:39] as a most necessary demonstration of the
[1:17:44] spirit in the individual life of the
[1:17:46] believer in the hour that we're living
[1:17:49] in right now
[1:17:50] we need them all i i believe let me just
[1:17:53] go ahead and say i believe that god has
[1:17:56] placed all nine spiritual gifts in his
[1:18:01] church
[1:18:03] anybody with me
[1:18:04] i need your help then
[1:18:06] i see in the word where god placed them
[1:18:08] there
[1:18:09] and i cannot find a verse where he has
[1:18:13] taken them out
[1:18:15] so i have to believe they're here until
[1:18:20] i doubt very seriously we'll need them
[1:18:23] in eternity
[1:18:25] but until
[1:18:26] perfect love has accomplished all that
[1:18:29] god will send it to accomplish and the
[1:18:32] bride goes out of here we know without
[1:18:35] that demonstration of god's perfect love
[1:18:38] there will never be a rapture
[1:18:41] so if you're looking for rapture you've
[1:18:44] got to believe that god will somehow
[1:18:47] demonstrate and manifest his perfect
[1:18:50] love in your life
[1:18:52] now he did that when he saved you
[1:18:56] that was perfect love
[1:18:58] and he did that when he kept you
[1:19:01] that was perfect love but what he
[1:19:03] desires to do is to pull us together
[1:19:07] in an atmosphere of perfect love
[1:19:10] so that we can love one another
[1:19:13] even as christ has loved the church and
[1:19:16] has given his life for the church
[1:19:19] this is where we struggle
[1:19:23] [Music]
[1:19:26] oh i love you i love you i love you i
[1:19:29] love you i love you we hear it all day
[1:19:30] long
[1:19:33] and i'm sure that people mean it often
[1:19:35] when they say it
[1:19:39] but to understand what it really means
[1:19:42] to demonstrate perfect love
[1:19:45] let me under let me help you to
[1:19:47] understand it doesn't mean tolerance
[1:19:52] that's not one of the fruits of the
[1:19:54] spirit
[1:19:56] long-suffering
[1:19:57] is the fruit of the spirit
[1:20:00] tolerance is not mentioned in there
[1:20:02] anybody with me
[1:20:03] so we're living in an hour where we're
[1:20:06] told that we have to just about tolerate
[1:20:08] whatever comes along
[1:20:10] and we have to do it in a gracious
[1:20:12] manner
[1:20:13] even if it means compromising god's word
[1:20:15] there's something that we just can't
[1:20:18] compromise on in this hour and that is
[1:20:22] the word of god
[1:20:24] it's life or death does anybody believe
[1:20:26] that the word of god is life or death
[1:20:31] it really is
[1:20:32] and so we want to understand if if all
[1:20:36] the nine gifts of the spirit have been
[1:20:39] given to the local church
[1:20:42] to the believer first and for and for
[1:20:45] demonstration in the local church if we
[1:20:49] were to look at all nine of those gifts
[1:20:52] and and tried to
[1:20:53] uh to figure out which one would be the
[1:20:57] most important of all those nine gifts i
[1:21:00] don't want to do that
[1:21:02] they're all by the same spirit paul said
[1:21:06] they're all given by the same spirit and
[1:21:08] they all manifest and and they are
[1:21:11] administered in the body by the same
[1:21:14] spirit
[1:21:15] and yet the bible said earnestly seek
[1:21:18] the best gift
[1:21:20] so when we look at that we want to
[1:21:22] understand what that means and and what
[1:21:24] i have come to understand is it's the
[1:21:27] gift that is needed in that moment
[1:21:30] if god's got at least nine gifts of the
[1:21:33] spirit that are to operate in the
[1:21:35] spirit-filled church then what gift do
[1:21:38] we need at the moment
[1:21:40] and whatever that gift the gift that
[1:21:42] would be needed the most in that moment
[1:21:45] that to me this is my understanding that
[1:21:49] to me would be the best gift for god to
[1:21:52] use among us
[1:21:54] in that hour
[1:21:55] am i confusing you
[1:21:57] you just didn't expect me to come talk
[1:21:59] about the gifts this morning did you
[1:22:01] um ah surprise
[1:22:06] now in
[1:22:07] the first reading verse 1 of chapter 12
[1:22:10] he said now concerning spiritual gifts
[1:22:12] brethren i would not have you to be
[1:22:15] ignorant
[1:22:16] one translation said to be misinformed
[1:22:20] and another translation said to be
[1:22:22] unaware of it must be
[1:22:25] that paul
[1:22:27] saw that it was important to define
[1:22:31] the operation of those gifts so that
[1:22:34] there be no confusion in the body about
[1:22:38] how they should operate
[1:22:40] [Music]
[1:22:44] so he said
[1:22:45] i don't want you to be ignorant about
[1:22:47] this stuff i want you to understand it
[1:22:50] and i want you to be able to see a
[1:22:52] little bit about how it should operate
[1:22:55] in the local church just stay with me
[1:22:58] because there may be something here you
[1:22:59] can use in a moment or two
[1:23:01] i mentioned uh a second ago that the
[1:23:04] common greek word used for the gifts of
[1:23:07] the spirit is the word charisma
[1:23:10] and if you use the plural of the greek
[1:23:13] word it's charismata
[1:23:15] and it comes from
[1:23:17] the the prefix or the root carees in
[1:23:21] greek which is
[1:23:23] grace
[1:23:24] and therefore we can understand that
[1:23:26] there's a very close relationship
[1:23:29] between spiritual gifts and the grace of
[1:23:33] god
[1:23:34] so if there are any spiritual gifts in
[1:23:37] operation in your life and there should
[1:23:39] be
[1:23:40] i want you to glance up this way every
[1:23:42] now and again
[1:23:44] there should be
[1:23:46] and if there are then that is grace
[1:23:50] to you
[1:23:51] now we have come to understand that
[1:23:53] there are those around the message of
[1:23:56] the hour that believe that gifts should
[1:23:59] no longer operate the problem with that
[1:24:02] is they don't have the authority to take
[1:24:04] out
[1:24:06] what god has put in
[1:24:10] so you go tell them do it your way
[1:24:13] we're going to try to do it god's way
[1:24:17] brother branham even tells us and the
[1:24:19] word tells us that these gifts should
[1:24:22] operate until there is a bride that is
[1:24:25] without spot wrinkle or blemish
[1:24:27] and then that bride is is presented to
[1:24:31] the bridegroom
[1:24:33] now you think about a man giving a woman
[1:24:35] a a a
[1:24:36] an engagement ring or some kind of token
[1:24:40] of his love for her and that's how the
[1:24:42] prophet describes these gifts
[1:24:44] he said these are god's love gifts to
[1:24:47] his church he is demonstrating his love
[1:24:51] and we know by the greek word he's also
[1:24:53] demonstrating his grace to allow these
[1:24:56] things to operate in us
[1:24:59] and if you have the baptism of the holy
[1:25:02] ghost you already have the potential for
[1:25:06] those gifts to operate in your life on a
[1:25:09] personal level
[1:25:11] now remember
[1:25:12] there is a difference between the
[1:25:14] operation of the gifts in the individual
[1:25:17] life of the believer and the operation
[1:25:20] of those gifts in the body
[1:25:25] as a as a community or as a church
[1:25:28] so we need the gifts of the spirit
[1:25:31] operating in our individual lives
[1:25:35] because we are we are quickened
[1:25:38] by the holy ghost that lives within us
[1:25:41] and these gifts are sometimes sent to
[1:25:43] the body to correct and to clean
[1:25:46] and if those gifts are operating in your
[1:25:49] life as an individual it may be that god
[1:25:52] would drop something into your heart
[1:25:54] that was not there before let's say a
[1:25:56] word of knowledge and tell you there's
[1:25:59] something you need to do differently
[1:26:01] than what you're doing
[1:26:03] so understand the gifts of the spirit
[1:26:06] can operate in the life of an individual
[1:26:10] holy ghost-filled believer
[1:26:13] and that person may never demonstrate
[1:26:17] those gifts in a corporate setting
[1:26:20] in the body of christ
[1:26:25] gifts and callings are not for private
[1:26:28] interpretations and it's not for you to
[1:26:31] try to put something on somebody else
[1:26:34] but aren't you glad that the holy ghost
[1:26:37] living inside of you is able to speak to
[1:26:40] you
[1:26:41] to give you a word of wisdom
[1:26:44] to give you a word of knowledge
[1:26:47] to give you understanding about what
[1:26:49] you're going through let me ask you a
[1:26:51] question
[1:26:52] have you ever had a situation in your
[1:26:54] life that you are so close to
[1:27:01] i'll slow down
[1:27:07] have you ever stood
[1:27:10] in a forest
[1:27:13] and couldn't see
[1:27:14] the forest
[1:27:16] for all the trees
[1:27:21] have you ever been in a situation that
[1:27:23] you could not see the spiritual
[1:27:25] dimension
[1:27:27] of that situation
[1:27:29] because you were so emotionally
[1:27:31] connected
[1:27:34] and so mentally close
[1:27:36] to what was happening around you
[1:27:39] and once it hits you
[1:27:41] it's like you've been gobsmacked
[1:27:44] whoa
[1:27:45] why didn't i see that before
[1:27:48] and you didn't see it before because you
[1:27:50] were so close
[1:27:51] [Music]
[1:27:54] that you couldn't really see your hand
[1:27:57] even though it was right in front of
[1:27:58] your face and this is why we not only
[1:28:02] need the exercise of the of the
[1:28:05] spiritual gifts within us
[1:28:08] and they are exercise by the way
[1:28:11] the bible talks about the nature of
[1:28:14] exercising spiritual gifts even in the
[1:28:16] life of the believer and that's yielding
[1:28:19] to what god's trying to say to you
[1:28:21] have you ever had the this this kind of
[1:28:24] discernment that god was trying to speak
[1:28:26] to you but you just couldn't quite hear
[1:28:28] what it was that he was trying to say
[1:28:31] and so what do you do you get steel
[1:28:35] you turn the dumb
[1:28:36] television off
[1:28:39] you put your phone down
[1:28:43] and you say lord
[1:28:44] i've got to hear from you
[1:28:47] i don't know if you've ever been that
[1:28:48] desperate or not but i have i've got to
[1:28:51] hear from you
[1:28:53] i know what i think
[1:28:55] and i know what i see
[1:28:57] and i know what i hear but i've got to
[1:28:59] hear from you
[1:29:01] i've got to know how you see this
[1:29:04] and what your discernment is
[1:29:07] and your interpretation of what's going
[1:29:10] on around us
[1:29:11] now i read to you just a moment ago and
[1:29:14] we better move on i read you just a
[1:29:16] moment ago first peter 4 10-11 can i
[1:29:18] read it in the amplified bible would you
[1:29:20] allow me to do that
[1:29:22] let's look at that in the amplified it
[1:29:25] says as each of you
[1:29:27] have received a gift
[1:29:30] a a particular
[1:29:32] spiritual talent
[1:29:34] a gracious divine endowment
[1:29:39] employ it
[1:29:40] for one another
[1:29:42] as
[1:29:43] as befits
[1:29:45] good trustees
[1:29:47] of god's
[1:29:49] many
[1:29:50] sided
[1:29:51] grace
[1:29:53] his manifold
[1:29:55] grace
[1:29:56] to us
[1:29:57] faithful
[1:29:58] stewards
[1:30:00] of the extremely diverse powers
[1:30:03] and gifts granted to christians by
[1:30:08] grace
[1:30:09] unmerited favor are you still there
[1:30:13] whoever speaks
[1:30:15] let him do it as one who utters oracles
[1:30:20] of god
[1:30:22] when we
[1:30:24] presume are assumed to speak for god
[1:30:28] we better know
[1:30:32] just teaching you a little you help me
[1:30:34] back
[1:30:35] we better know
[1:30:38] when we say the lord showed me
[1:30:40] the lord told me
[1:30:42] the lord led me
[1:30:44] i felt led of the lord when we say that
[1:30:47] we better know what we're talking about
[1:30:50] we are to speak when we speak on behalf
[1:30:53] of the spirit we've got to know that we
[1:30:56] are speaking by the oracles by the
[1:30:58] inspiration of god
[1:31:00] you know brother branham talks about the
[1:31:02] end time bride and he said she will have
[1:31:05] thus saith the lord
[1:31:09] she
[1:31:13] not he
[1:31:15] she what's the difference because we
[1:31:18] know that she represents the body
[1:31:22] she represents the bride church
[1:31:25] so it's not just the prophet
[1:31:28] it's or the bridegroom even
[1:31:30] but it's the bride
[1:31:32] she will have thus saith the lord or she
[1:31:37] will hold her peace
[1:31:41] this is really what paul is saying if
[1:31:44] you're going to presume to speak for the
[1:31:47] lord as though demonstrating a spiritual
[1:31:50] gift make sure that you know
[1:31:54] now this is not to put fear in your
[1:31:56] heart from being obedient to the spirit
[1:31:59] it's telling you the only way to know is
[1:32:02] to exercise this
[1:32:05] just telling what the scripture says
[1:32:07] you use it
[1:32:09] use it in your own individual life
[1:32:13] until you can become confident
[1:32:16] that what you hear is from the lord
[1:32:20] and only then
[1:32:27] maybe this should have been a tuesday
[1:32:28] night teaching
[1:32:29] but that's not what he said
[1:32:33] then and only then should we assume
[1:32:36] or presume to speak in his name
[1:32:39] and paul is being pretty specific here
[1:32:41] whoever speaks let him do it is one who
[1:32:44] orders are oracles of god utters oracles
[1:32:47] of god whoever renders him service let
[1:32:50] him do it as with the strength which god
[1:32:53] furnishes abundantly so that in all
[1:32:56] things god may be glorified through
[1:32:59] jesus christ the messiah could i have
[1:33:02] just a half a hair in the monitor just a
[1:33:05] little bit more in the monitor so that i
[1:33:07] i think it's plenty loud out there but
[1:33:09] just a little bit in the monitor so i
[1:33:11] don't feel like i need to continue to
[1:33:13] strain to him be the glory and dominion
[1:33:17] forever and ever through endless ages
[1:33:19] amen which means so be it so paul and
[1:33:23] now peter
[1:33:25] speaking to us about the exercising of
[1:33:29] spiritual gifts both in an individual
[1:33:32] life my life have you ever needed
[1:33:35] knowledge
[1:33:36] that didn't come from information have
[1:33:38] you ever needed god's knowledge
[1:33:41] have you ever needed god's wisdom
[1:33:43] have you ever needed something that was
[1:33:45] so clear that you could just step out on
[1:33:47] that and know that it came from god have
[1:33:50] you ever needed to be able to discern
[1:33:52] between a spirit
[1:33:56] whether it's a god spirit or an enemy
[1:33:58] spirit whether it's the holy ghost or
[1:34:00] whether it's a false spirit have you
[1:34:02] ever needed that in your personal life
[1:34:05] so that you would not be taken under the
[1:34:07] spell of something that was not of god
[1:34:10] so i want you to know concerning the
[1:34:12] spiritual gifts we need them in the body
[1:34:16] but i also need them in the body
[1:34:19] i need them in my life as an individual
[1:34:22] believer
[1:34:23] so that i can be sharp
[1:34:25] in the things that are spiritual
[1:34:28] and it also helps me to discern between
[1:34:30] that which is spiritual and that which
[1:34:32] is carnal
[1:34:34] because we would like to admit it but
[1:34:36] there's quite a bit of carnality still
[1:34:38] operating in all of our lives
[1:34:40] so we want to be able to know am i
[1:34:42] moving by the spirit
[1:34:45] or am i moving by the flesh
[1:34:48] and i don't know about you but i'm
[1:34:49] capable of doing both on a regular basis
[1:34:53] well i do know about you too
[1:34:56] i'm just trying to be transparent
[1:34:58] you know it doesn't matter how spiritual
[1:35:00] you get you're still a human
[1:35:02] and you still have human emotions
[1:35:05] and you still have human feelings and
[1:35:07] that's why you need to exercise these
[1:35:09] things in your spiritual walk with god
[1:35:12] now because the age isn't getting
[1:35:15] lighter the age is getting heavier and
[1:35:18] the spirit of the age is not withdrawing
[1:35:21] the spirit of the age is invading
[1:35:24] and we're going to need to walk very
[1:35:26] circumspectly in this hour and we're
[1:35:28] going to be able to know and we're not
[1:35:30] always going to have time to lay before
[1:35:32] the lord and fast 21 days to know what's
[1:35:34] god and what's not
[1:35:36] the bride is going to have to know
[1:35:38] brother you're going to have to know you
[1:35:40] don't even have to go after devils are
[1:35:42] looking for demons to find them
[1:35:46] somebody said you don't really believe
[1:35:48] there are literal demons around do you
[1:35:50] oh
[1:35:51] yes
[1:35:54] i didn't have to wait till i got to be
[1:35:56] an old man to discover that either
[1:35:58] because when i was just a young boy i
[1:36:01] would wake up many times in the night
[1:36:03] until i discovered what was trying to
[1:36:05] take a hold of my life
[1:36:07] and and i discovered it and i've told
[1:36:09] you very transparently through the years
[1:36:12] that i discovered as a pre-teen
[1:36:15] that lust
[1:36:17] was trying to take a hold of my life to
[1:36:20] destroy the call of god on me
[1:36:22] anybody ever heard me tell that
[1:36:25] i've told that multiple times i didn't
[1:36:27] know where it came from
[1:36:29] i didn't even know what it fully was
[1:36:33] i wasn't even 13 years old
[1:36:36] i wasn't i mean i was pre
[1:36:39] i would say looking back pre-puberty
[1:36:43] and things began to torment me
[1:36:46] and i awakened in the night and i know i
[1:36:49] know this is sort of a mixed audience
[1:36:50] here and especially through the stream
[1:36:52] but it just happened i mean it just
[1:36:54] really happened
[1:36:55] i'm not here to convince you it did
[1:36:58] but i might as well just tell it like it
[1:36:59] is instead of instead of trying to
[1:37:01] disguise it
[1:37:03] brother perry green got onto me one time
[1:37:05] he said you said that was a vision
[1:37:08] and he said but you described it as
[1:37:10] though it were a dream and he said i
[1:37:12] kind of sensed in my spirit that you did
[1:37:14] that because you didn't want to trip
[1:37:16] somebody up about having a vision
[1:37:19] but he said it's important for god's
[1:37:21] people to know that visions are still a
[1:37:24] part of the supernatural christian life
[1:37:28] and he said for you to make it sound as
[1:37:30] though it were a dream when it was
[1:37:32] indeed a vision it's not helping people
[1:37:34] to see that god is still giving visions
[1:37:37] to young men and dreams to all men as
[1:37:40] the scripture said
[1:37:42] the bible tells us in the book of joel
[1:37:44] that in the last days god will pour out
[1:37:47] his spirit upon all flesh
[1:37:50] and in the book of in the book of acts
[1:37:52] peter stands up under the inspiration of
[1:37:54] the holy ghost and he says hey
[1:37:57] this is that
[1:38:01] this is the restoration of god's spirit
[1:38:05] falling on all flesh
[1:38:07] then we know that as history went
[1:38:09] forward there was the dark ages and
[1:38:12] everything that god had added to the
[1:38:14] church that old devil like a like a
[1:38:17] locust like a caterpillar like a palmer
[1:38:20] worm
[1:38:21] was there eating away
[1:38:24] you're with me
[1:38:25] at what god had restored to his church
[1:38:28] and so there had to be a re-restoration
[1:38:32] there had to be a final
[1:38:35] let me let me
[1:38:36] make that clear
[1:38:38] a final restoration
[1:38:41] the bride will never lose what god has
[1:38:45] placed in her she will never lose that
[1:38:50] as long as the bride has ministry in the
[1:38:53] earth everything that god has given to
[1:38:55] his bride will be operational in your
[1:38:58] life there will never be a time that
[1:39:00] you're left here on planet earth without
[1:39:02] the working of the holy ghost in you and
[1:39:04] the gifts of the holy spirit manifesting
[1:39:06] in your life as an individual and
[1:39:08] corporately as a church so those men who
[1:39:11] preach that these things are over
[1:39:13] because that which is perfect has come
[1:39:16] have totally misunderstood the context
[1:39:18] of that verse of scripture that appears
[1:39:21] in a chapter about love
[1:39:25] it appears in a chapter about love and
[1:39:27] that chapter about love is sandwiched
[1:39:31] did i just say sandwiched
[1:39:34] it is sandwiched
[1:39:41] my granddaddy never called it a sandwich
[1:39:44] he said a sandwich
[1:39:47] it is sandwiched between chapters
[1:39:50] talking about the gifts
[1:39:52] now isn't that amazing that the that the
[1:39:55] apostle would interrupt his teaching on
[1:39:57] gifts
[1:39:59] to dedicate a whole chapter to love
[1:40:03] and then pick up right where he left off
[1:40:05] continuing to expound about the gifts
[1:40:08] that's because the gifts that are to be
[1:40:10] given to the body of christ must be
[1:40:14] demonstrated
[1:40:15] by
[1:40:16] love
[1:40:18] love must be the motivation of all gifts
[1:40:23] operating among us because those gifts
[1:40:26] are an extended demonstration of god's
[1:40:29] grace to the believer
[1:40:31] and when they operate in your life as an
[1:40:33] individual or when you allow that gift
[1:40:36] to to to speak out of you to to a body
[1:40:40] of believers as some of you do on
[1:40:42] occasion you must make sure that you are
[1:40:46] yielding yourself
[1:40:48] to love
[1:40:53] there's one thing we need to know about
[1:40:54] him
[1:40:56] god is not the author
[1:40:59] you finish it
[1:41:01] he is not the author of confusion and so
[1:41:03] he didn't send the love gifts to the
[1:41:06] body to confuse us
[1:41:09] anybody helping me
[1:41:11] he sent the love gifts to help us
[1:41:14] to build us up
[1:41:16] to help us to stay in the right path
[1:41:20] anybody with me
[1:41:22] so according to this passage each
[1:41:24] spirit-filled believer
[1:41:25] has at least one gift
[1:41:28] demonstrating in their life
[1:41:31] because he talks about when we receive
[1:41:33] the spirit we receive the giver
[1:41:36] and if you have received the giver of
[1:41:39] the gift then i know that there are
[1:41:41] giftings inside of you
[1:41:44] they may only be there to lead you as a
[1:41:48] believer
[1:41:50] or they may be there because god wants
[1:41:53] to use you to help the body of christ at
[1:41:57] large
[1:41:58] not even just locally
[1:42:01] but there are gifts of the spirit that
[1:42:03] are so large
[1:42:05] because they come from a big god
[1:42:08] that they transcend the local four walls
[1:42:12] of the church
[1:42:13] and they become a gifting
[1:42:16] to the body of christ at large somebody
[1:42:19] said how's that possible well he that
[1:42:20] hath an ear to hear
[1:42:23] let him hear what the spirit sayeth if
[1:42:25] you don't have an ear to hear then
[1:42:26] that's not going to impact you you're
[1:42:28] going to shed it like a duck sheds water
[1:42:31] let me also remind you before we move on
[1:42:33] that the gifts and callings of god are
[1:42:36] without repentance
[1:42:38] and it's very possible for someone to
[1:42:40] operate in a genuine gift even though
[1:42:42] their life
[1:42:45] is not lined up with the word
[1:42:49] i tell you if that if that demonstrates
[1:42:51] then we got to make sure that we have
[1:42:55] one of the gifts
[1:42:58] the one i'm going to talk about this
[1:43:00] morning
[1:43:02] i'm not going to talk about tongues this
[1:43:03] morning
[1:43:05] or the interpretation of tongues
[1:43:08] we believe in tongues
[1:43:10] we don't particularly teach like many of
[1:43:13] our pentecostal friends do that it's the
[1:43:15] initial evidence and the reason why we
[1:43:17] don't teach that is because it gives
[1:43:20] people an impression
[1:43:25] that if you speak in tongues
[1:43:28] you have the holy ghost now that's false
[1:43:34] i don't mean i don't mean to offend
[1:43:36] anybody
[1:43:37] but that's false
[1:43:38] so that's why you don't hear us saying
[1:43:40] that speaking in tongues is the initial
[1:43:42] evidence because we don't want someone
[1:43:45] to come under the impression that
[1:43:47] because they they had a uh you know had
[1:43:50] some syllables
[1:43:52] and they said some rat tats or some i
[1:43:54] don't mean to i'm being very serious
[1:43:56] just trying to be very honest here
[1:43:59] i hope that didn't offend you
[1:44:01] i'm not making fun of speaking in
[1:44:02] tongues
[1:44:04] i can be like paul said i thank my god i
[1:44:07] speak in tongues more than you all
[1:44:09] i've been labeled in our movement as a
[1:44:11] tongue talker
[1:44:15] they used to say well if brother shelley
[1:44:16] could quit talking in tongues long
[1:44:18] enough he could preach something to us
[1:44:20] the fact is i wasn't talking in tongues
[1:44:22] in the pulpit they just didn't like the
[1:44:24] fact that i ever talked in tongues
[1:44:27] so i don't want to go to that extreme
[1:44:28] either
[1:44:29] i don't want to teach somebody that
[1:44:31] because you got your tongue a little
[1:44:33] twisted there and a feel-good feeling on
[1:44:35] you that you have the holy ghost
[1:44:38] because having the baptism of the holy
[1:44:40] ghost is more than speaking in tongues
[1:44:43] it's the grace to be able to live a life
[1:44:46] surrendered
[1:44:48] to every word of god
[1:44:50] it is also the ability to be able to
[1:44:52] recognize the message for your day
[1:44:58] one of the evidences that someone has
[1:45:00] received the full baptism of the holy
[1:45:02] ghost
[1:45:02] is to be able to recognize what god is
[1:45:04] saying to the church in the day and hour
[1:45:06] that they live in
[1:45:08] instead of trying to resurrect something
[1:45:10] that may not be what god would say to
[1:45:12] you today
[1:45:14] it doesn't mean that it's not the truth
[1:45:16] it means how can we know what god would
[1:45:19] say if god were standing in our midst
[1:45:22] and i pray that he is
[1:45:24] because he lives in the believer
[1:45:28] since i have seen
[1:45:30] demonstrations of the demonic that spoke
[1:45:33] in tongues
[1:45:39] i've seen women who control their homes
[1:45:45] talk in tongues
[1:45:50] i've seen all kinds of demonstrations i
[1:45:53] i have been in the islands
[1:45:56] and i have seen false religions
[1:46:00] somewhat similar to voodoo
[1:46:02] get caught up in the emotion of some
[1:46:05] demonstration
[1:46:07] and begin to speak in an unlearned
[1:46:09] language
[1:46:10] now if if i should teach you that
[1:46:12] initial evidence is speaking in tongues
[1:46:14] then i would be sitting there and i
[1:46:16] would be thinking my these these
[1:46:18] shirtless
[1:46:19] heathen
[1:46:21] dancing around this fire
[1:46:24] rattling in some kind of ecstatic
[1:46:26] language they must also have the holy
[1:46:28] ghost
[1:46:30] and how many of you know that's just not
[1:46:32] the way it is
[1:46:33] there's a higher evidence of that
[1:46:35] however i will tell you that i believe
[1:46:37] that anyone who experiences the genuine
[1:46:39] baptism of the holy ghost at some time
[1:46:41] or another in their life it will be
[1:46:43] testified to them by the gifting of
[1:46:46] speaking in tongues you will have that
[1:46:48] if you desire it
[1:46:50] and i don't know about you but i desired
[1:46:52] it
[1:46:53] and the reason why i desired it is
[1:46:55] because i saw it and i heard it and i
[1:46:58] felt it and i said i want that
[1:47:01] you say well in that being a little bit
[1:47:03] greedy i want you to know when you see
[1:47:05] what god is capable of doing in the life
[1:47:08] of a believer you might get a little
[1:47:10] greedy too and you might say give me
[1:47:13] that lord i'd like to have that
[1:47:16] and he giveth to every man severally
[1:47:18] according to his will as he desires as
[1:47:21] he sees fit are you still with me
[1:47:23] and he does it to profit with all i'm
[1:47:25] not going to talk about prophecy i'm not
[1:47:27] going to talk about words of wisdom or
[1:47:29] knowledge or faith or healing or
[1:47:31] miracles or i'm going to talk about in a
[1:47:34] moment one particular gift the gift of
[1:47:37] discerning of spirits
[1:47:42] if i were to
[1:47:44] have to choose
[1:47:46] and say of all the gifts
[1:47:49] that we need operating in our life
[1:47:53] not only in the body at large
[1:47:55] but if i were to say one of the most let
[1:47:58] me just say it that way so i don't
[1:47:59] offend or leave anybody out or anything
[1:48:01] out but let me just say it this way one
[1:48:04] of the most important
[1:48:06] and vital giftings of the spirit in the
[1:48:09] life of an individual believer is the
[1:48:11] ability by the spirit
[1:48:14] to discern is this spirit of the lord
[1:48:19] or as is it
[1:48:21] of the flesh
[1:48:23] or of the enemy
[1:48:26] how many of you can see the value of
[1:48:27] having that operating in your life i'm
[1:48:30] not trying to put something on if you
[1:48:31] don't want it you don't have to have it
[1:48:34] but just don't come and tell me what's
[1:48:36] god and what's not
[1:48:38] because we can't even make
[1:48:41] a fair assessment
[1:48:46] you know what to get
[1:48:47] let me just say this i think i'm all
[1:48:49] over the place but that's all right uh
[1:48:51] let me just explain to you that how god
[1:48:54] feels about the holy ghost
[1:48:57] we know the holy ghost is god we don't
[1:49:00] believe that there's three persons in a
[1:49:02] godhead we believe there's one
[1:49:04] and that god manifests himself in three
[1:49:07] great offices
[1:49:08] and three very distinct ministries
[1:49:11] in fact we we get radical sometime and
[1:49:13] we say plus a whole lot more
[1:49:17] because he's a healer too
[1:49:20] and a lawyer
[1:49:21] and a counselor
[1:49:23] and a teacher come on now
[1:49:25] but we understand that in the godhead is
[1:49:28] the demonstration of father the
[1:49:29] demonstration of son and the
[1:49:31] demonstration of holy ghost one of the
[1:49:32] most powerful revelations that needs to
[1:49:34] be preached from pulpits across america
[1:49:37] is that jehovah of the old testament is
[1:49:39] jesus of the new testament it's pretty
[1:49:41] simple isn't it
[1:49:43] and yet the largest portion of the
[1:49:45] church at large does not believe that
[1:49:47] jesus is the same as god
[1:49:50] they will call him god and then
[1:49:52] theologically explain to you why he's
[1:49:54] not god how many of you are glad you've
[1:49:56] got a revelation
[1:49:58] that when jesus is talking to you that's
[1:49:59] god's voice that's him speaking to you
[1:50:02] and when jesus worked on the earth and
[1:50:04] ministered he was there to minister the
[1:50:06] works of the father and when he spoke
[1:50:08] that was the father speaking through him
[1:50:11] because he said i am my father or what
[1:50:14] we're one
[1:50:16] now let me talk just a moment before we
[1:50:18] before we move into this and i know it's
[1:50:20] getting late already but that's all
[1:50:21] right
[1:50:22] if you do find the need to slip out i
[1:50:24] know you'll do it quietly and reverently
[1:50:26] and i know that you would never expect
[1:50:28] us
[1:50:29] to to stop early because you have an
[1:50:32] engagement i know you wouldn't want to
[1:50:33] do that i know you wouldn't want to do
[1:50:35] that so if you need to slip out at some
[1:50:37] point you certainly can
[1:50:39] but don't miss if you if you can uh hang
[1:50:41] around then do that because god might
[1:50:44] be desiring to do something for you
[1:50:47] the purpose of spiritual gifts at large
[1:50:50] we're talking about the nine spiritual
[1:50:51] gifts now
[1:50:52] in first corinthians 12 but the purpose
[1:50:55] of those gifts is to edify the body to
[1:50:58] equip the saints and to glorify god do
[1:51:00] you want to write that down you that
[1:51:01] like to take notes some of you been
[1:51:03] writing the whole time
[1:51:04] edify the body equip the saints and
[1:51:06] glorify god and the bible said this is
[1:51:09] so that the body can profit with all and
[1:51:12] in first corinthians chapter 12 and
[1:51:14] verse 11 he said but all these things
[1:51:16] worketh
[1:51:17] this is the summary of it but all these
[1:51:20] things worketh 12 11
[1:51:23] that one and the self same spirit
[1:51:28] dividing to every man severally
[1:51:32] as he will
[1:51:35] it's up to him
[1:51:36] you want to you want to hear the phrase
[1:51:38] how that reads in the amplified in the
[1:51:40] amplified it reads who apportions
[1:51:43] to each person individually exactly as
[1:51:48] he chooses
[1:51:50] are you with me
[1:51:51] as he chooses
[1:51:53] the gifts of the spirit are up to god
[1:51:55] and who operates in those gifts is up to
[1:51:58] god and how they function in our church
[1:52:01] body and in our lives is up to god
[1:52:04] because it's the giver we love
[1:52:06] may we never be like those who love the
[1:52:09] gifts more than they love the giver
[1:52:11] we've got to fall in love with the gift
[1:52:15] the giver of the gift
[1:52:17] the giver of the gifts is the one that
[1:52:20] we love now ephesians 4 16 if you'll put
[1:52:23] that up there just a minute and we're
[1:52:24] fixed to take off
[1:52:26] in this
[1:52:27] from whom the whole body
[1:52:30] fitly joined together
[1:52:33] and compacted
[1:52:35] by that which every joint supplieth
[1:52:40] according to the effectual working in
[1:52:42] the measure of every part maketh
[1:52:45] increase of the body unto the edifying
[1:52:48] of itself in love do you mind if i break
[1:52:51] that down a little bit
[1:52:54] the amplified reads a little bit
[1:52:56] smoother
[1:52:57] for because of him
[1:53:00] the whole body
[1:53:03] the church
[1:53:05] in all its various parts
[1:53:08] closely joined and firmly knit together
[1:53:13] by the joints and ligaments
[1:53:15] with which it is supplied
[1:53:18] when each part with power adapted to its
[1:53:22] need is working properly in all its
[1:53:27] functions
[1:53:28] grows
[1:53:30] to full
[1:53:31] maturity
[1:53:32] building itself up
[1:53:35] in love
[1:53:39] anybody got a bad joint this is one time
[1:53:41] you can confess it anybody got a bad
[1:53:43] joint
[1:53:46] anybody believing for a better joint
[1:53:50] he's a healer
[1:53:52] he's a healer and we know that he's
[1:53:54] healed us
[1:53:55] and many of us have experienced healing
[1:53:58] in our joints
[1:54:00] i just recently testified to you about
[1:54:01] my elbow
[1:54:03] that swelled up so large
[1:54:05] and looked
[1:54:07] hideous
[1:54:08] and had a big old knot on the end of it
[1:54:10] and somebody said it was bursitis and
[1:54:13] somebody said it was gout related and
[1:54:14] somebody said it was this or that in the
[1:54:16] other but i think it was when sister
[1:54:18] heichi passed away i think it was with
[1:54:21] sister heist he passed away that i first
[1:54:22] had it and i had to put my arm in a
[1:54:24] sling because i could hardly move that
[1:54:26] joint and you may you may not believe
[1:54:29] this but i tell you what the worst part
[1:54:32] of it
[1:54:33] the worst part of it wasn't the pain and
[1:54:36] it wasn't having to do things with my
[1:54:38] left hand the worst part of it for me
[1:54:40] was not being able to use both arms
[1:54:44] to praise the lord
[1:54:46] i mean it
[1:54:47] this one was like that and i could not
[1:54:49] stand it i kept believing and kept
[1:54:52] believing and god finally gave me the
[1:54:54] mobility back in that joint but the pain
[1:54:56] and the swelling and the fluid was still
[1:54:58] there but i want you to know i kept
[1:55:00] praising him for giving me a joint
[1:55:03] giving me an elbow that worked and i
[1:55:06] kept telling the lord i want to be able
[1:55:08] to praise you
[1:55:12] i want to be able to use that hand to
[1:55:14] give you glory and honor and praise and
[1:55:16] it's uncomfortable
[1:55:18] and i want to be able to turn over in
[1:55:19] the night using my elbow without pain i
[1:55:22] need you lord and you know what he did
[1:55:24] it
[1:55:26] he did it
[1:55:28] so i believe god with you
[1:55:31] he can help you
[1:55:32] i've seen god do miraculous things
[1:55:35] i've seen him cause the to get
[1:55:37] up and walk
[1:55:38] i've seen god heal broken backs
[1:55:40] if god can heal a broken back he can
[1:55:42] take care of a joint that's got a little
[1:55:44] problem inflammation or pain or
[1:55:46] something in it amen
[1:55:47] but you know what about a joint if your
[1:55:50] joint is not functioning properly
[1:55:52] especially particular joints of the body
[1:55:55] it throws the whole body off
[1:55:58] now you're looking at somebody who's had
[1:56:00] some pretty pretty serious foot issues
[1:56:02] through the years two surgeries to
[1:56:04] correct problems and you know what
[1:56:07] by by having uh a joint a tendon or some
[1:56:11] little part of the body not functioning
[1:56:14] the way it's supposed to you you
[1:56:16] compensate for that
[1:56:18] stay with me a moment you over
[1:56:20] overcompensate for that you limp a
[1:56:22] little different you turn it a little
[1:56:24] different to be able to walk
[1:56:25] without pain and the next thing you know
[1:56:28] the whole body
[1:56:32] your whole body gets thrown off
[1:56:34] and this is really what paul's talking
[1:56:35] about
[1:56:36] paul is really telling us that it is
[1:56:38] vitally important
[1:56:40] for the body to be able to grow in
[1:56:42] christian maturity and the only way the
[1:56:45] body can grow into full maturity
[1:56:47] building itself up in love is to have
[1:56:50] every joint functioning joined and
[1:56:53] firmly knit together by the joints and
[1:56:55] ligaments which are supplied by the
[1:56:58] spirit
[1:57:00] the apostle is confirming that the works
[1:57:03] of the spirit become the connective
[1:57:06] tissue that holds the body of christ
[1:57:10] together
[1:57:12] are you with me
[1:57:13] so if you don't have the manifestation
[1:57:16] of the spirit in your life as an
[1:57:18] individual or there's a church that
[1:57:20] doesn't have the gifts of the spirit
[1:57:22] with freedom to manifest
[1:57:24] in whatever way the church sets them i'm
[1:57:26] not against anybody else's order however
[1:57:29] the church is sovereign and however the
[1:57:32] church decides to exercise the gifts of
[1:57:34] the spirit is none of my business i am
[1:57:37] only responsible for this house
[1:57:42] and i am deeply concerned
[1:57:45] that we not shut out
[1:57:48] the works of the spirit
[1:57:50] that we allow god to move among us
[1:57:54] and do what he wants to do for as long
[1:57:56] as he wants to do it is anybody in
[1:57:59] agreement with me
[1:58:01] and here's what i have said concerning
[1:58:03] the gifts of the spirit if they are to
[1:58:05] operate on the floor make sure
[1:58:09] that you are willing to be corrected
[1:58:13] on the floor
[1:58:16] now why is that important it's important
[1:58:17] because brother branham established an
[1:58:19] order for his tabernacle that was
[1:58:21] different than that
[1:58:24] because for so many years there were so
[1:58:25] many interruptions in the in the service
[1:58:28] and i read the letter that brother billy
[1:58:30] paul wrote to my good friend brother
[1:58:32] cleveland explaining that there was one
[1:58:35] particular brother that would not settle
[1:58:38] down
[1:58:41] and some of the things that brother
[1:58:42] branham said publicly to address the
[1:58:45] gifts and how they should operate in the
[1:58:47] church was because of one brother
[1:58:50] that wouldn't hear the word of the lord
[1:58:53] and hold his peace he kept interrupting
[1:58:56] the flow of even the preaching and how
[1:58:58] many of you know the bible said that the
[1:59:00] spirit of the prophet is subject unto
[1:59:03] the prophet
[1:59:04] and so there's a time and when the word
[1:59:07] is going forth that's not the time to
[1:59:09] start exercising spiritual gifts on the
[1:59:11] floor are you following me you can find
[1:59:14] all of this information in first
[1:59:15] corinthians
[1:59:16] there's a time and a place
[1:59:19] i even have watched god create an
[1:59:21] atmosphere of lull
[1:59:24] you come to a high
[1:59:26] moment in praise
[1:59:28] and then all of a sudden the atmosphere
[1:59:30] shifts
[1:59:31] and it's almost like you just come
[1:59:32] floating gently back down from wherever
[1:59:34] you've whatever high you've experienced
[1:59:37] in the spirit do we sound like a bunch
[1:59:39] of addicts
[1:59:45] i've never been drunk in the natural
[1:59:48] i don't even know what it feels like to
[1:59:50] be drunk
[1:59:51] in the natural
[1:59:54] i don't think i've missed anything
[1:59:58] by the grace of god i've never spent a
[2:00:00] morning or a night
[2:00:02] hugging a toilet bowl
[2:00:06] afraid i was going to lose more than my
[2:00:08] drink
[2:00:10] never had to do it never had to have a
[2:00:12] hangover except a spiritual one a time
[2:00:14] or two
[2:00:16] that's the grace of god
[2:00:18] i'm not bragging to you
[2:00:19] i'm telling you that he baptized me with
[2:00:21] the holy ghost and fire when i was seven
[2:00:24] years old
[2:00:25] and there was nothing i had nothing else
[2:00:27] to work off of and so i had no reason to
[2:00:29] believe that anything that was out there
[2:00:31] in the world could possibly match
[2:00:35] what god was doing in my life
[2:00:37] never high
[2:00:40] never smoked a joint
[2:00:43] never popped an upper
[2:00:46] never smoked a mushroom is that what you
[2:00:48] do with mushrooms
[2:00:50] i've eaten a few at olive garden
[2:00:57] i don't even know the language now
[2:01:00] my kids laugh at me sometime i don't
[2:01:02] know how they know so much about it
[2:01:07] because people talk about things now a
[2:01:09] whole lot more freely than they used to
[2:01:10] talk about things
[2:01:14] stone
[2:01:15] meant
[2:01:16] killed
[2:01:19] [Music]
[2:01:25] just like i can still remember when gabe
[2:01:27] been happy
[2:01:31] come on
[2:01:33] it's hard to keep up with all the
[2:01:34] redefinition of things
[2:01:40] when i was uh you know
[2:01:42] filling out forms in school and things
[2:01:44] like that it was very easy there were
[2:01:46] only two boxes to check male or female
[2:01:49] very quick
[2:01:51] i never one time had to question which i
[2:01:53] was
[2:01:57] i knew i only had two choices
[2:02:00] i knew what it wasn't so i surely knew
[2:02:02] what it was
[2:02:03] oh we're in another hour now
[2:02:07] don't you look at me like that
[2:02:10] you can be silent if you want to be
[2:02:12] silent
[2:02:13] but once you get some of this discerning
[2:02:16] of spirits operating in your life
[2:02:18] and start yielding to it you will
[2:02:20] recognize that a lot of what's happening
[2:02:23] around us now is demonic
[2:02:28] it's demonic
[2:02:31] and if a church is so lily-livered and
[2:02:34] yellow that they can't call it what the
[2:02:36] bible calls it
[2:02:39] i don't want to be a part of that system
[2:02:41] somebody said but you must reach out in
[2:02:44] love sure we must
[2:02:46] we must embrace with love we must
[2:02:49] minister with love but we must not
[2:02:53] compromise the word of god to do it
[2:02:57] [Applause]
[2:02:59] because if we do there is no deliverance
[2:03:04] for those who are in trouble
[2:03:06] you will never love somebody to
[2:03:09] deliverance
[2:03:12] you may pray them there because you love
[2:03:14] them
[2:03:15] you may pray them there because you love
[2:03:17] them but it takes more than just a hug
[2:03:24] it takes authority
[2:03:26] and i want to tell you something that a
[2:03:28] lot of people don't like it doesn't
[2:03:30] necessarily take a deliverance preacher
[2:03:31] either
[2:03:33] i want you to know there's deliverance
[2:03:34] in your mouth
[2:03:36] if you're a holy ghost-filled believer
[2:03:38] there is deliverance in your
[2:03:40] mouth and god will honor what you say
[2:03:45] when you speak his word
[2:03:46] this is why we want the operation of
[2:03:48] that going on in our life because we
[2:03:50] want to know when god says speak we want
[2:03:52] to speak and when he says shut up
[2:03:56] we want to discern that it's time to
[2:03:58] shut up
[2:03:59] anybody with me
[2:04:01] gotta hurry
[2:04:03] gotta
[2:04:08] hurry not an accident or coincidence
[2:04:11] that first corinthians chapter 13
[2:04:13] appears right in the middle of the
[2:04:14] apostles instructions concerning the
[2:04:16] spiritual gifts as we said just a moment
[2:04:18] now let's look at first corinthians 12
[2:04:21] verse 4.
[2:04:23] all the way through verse 11. can i have
[2:04:25] a little more
[2:04:26] good because we're usually here another
[2:04:28] hour
[2:04:31] there are diversities of gifts
[2:04:35] would you read the rest
[2:04:37] but the same spirit
[2:04:39] there are differences of ministries
[2:04:41] would you read the rest
[2:04:44] and there are diversities of activities
[2:04:49] works all in all but the manifestation
[2:04:53] of the spirit is given to each one for
[2:04:55] the prophet of all
[2:04:58] four to one is given the word of wisdom
[2:05:00] finish it
[2:05:03] wait a minute
[2:05:12] just a moment
[2:05:21] i must not have king james here i
[2:05:23] thought i had king james i must not have
[2:05:25] king james because in this
[2:05:27] in in my translation it says again
[2:05:30] through the spirit
[2:05:32] it says
[2:05:33] but the manifestation of the spirit is
[2:05:34] given to each one to profit for all for
[2:05:36] the one is given the word of wisdom
[2:05:37] through the spirit to another the word
[2:05:39] of knowledge through the same spirit so
[2:05:42] i must have another translation here
[2:05:43] let's continue to read with yours and
[2:05:45] i'm sorry for stopping you for to one is
[2:05:48] given by the spirit the word of wisdom
[2:05:50] to another the word of knowledge
[2:05:54] by the same spirit
[2:05:58] to another faith
[2:06:01] to another the gifts of healing
[2:06:05] to another gifts of
[2:06:07] uh excuse me
[2:06:09] to another the working of miracles to
[2:06:13] another prophecy
[2:06:15] to another
[2:06:16] discerning of spirits to another diverse
[2:06:20] kinds of tongues to another the
[2:06:23] interpretation of tongues now the next
[2:06:26] verse but all these
[2:06:30] worketh
[2:06:31] that one and the self-same spirit
[2:06:35] dividing to every man
[2:06:38] severally
[2:06:40] as he will
[2:06:42] so if the gift is tongues it's by the
[2:06:44] holy spirit if it's interpretation of
[2:06:46] tongues by the holy spirit if it's a
[2:06:49] gift of miracles by the holy spirit

[2:08:04] and read those quotes again during the
[2:08:05] week you might find yourself growing
[2:08:08] in a faster way than just hearing it
[2:08:11] here on sunday when you get so tired you
[2:08:13] can hardly hear anyway
[2:08:15] see
[2:08:16] it's there for you god's good to us to
[2:08:18] give us that kind of a technology we're
[2:08:20] getting ready to launch it hasn't
[2:08:21] launched just yet to my understanding
[2:08:23] but we're getting ready to launch a live
[2:08:25] chat on the app
[2:08:27] and on the web on the website just like
[2:08:30] we have on youtube and facebook so when
[2:08:32] the service is going out someone will be
[2:08:34] able to type on the app and tell us
[2:08:37] where they're watching from
[2:08:39] and give us a prayer request and if i
[2:08:41] i'm just glancing down here at youtube
[2:08:43] right now and we have saints greeting us
[2:08:45] from all over the world from trinidad to
[2:08:48] to south uh africa
[2:08:50] and and it goes on and on and on west
[2:08:52] africa and
[2:08:54] each one of them will be able to do that
[2:08:55] in the near future even using the app
[2:08:58] because our tuesday services are only
[2:09:00] available on the website and the app
[2:09:02] that wasn't a commercial that's just
[2:09:03] letting you know what's going on
[2:09:05] now this chart here says nine spiritual
[2:09:08] gifts that's the charismata it's the
[2:09:10] it's plural for gifts three divisions
[2:09:14] of gifts number one speaking gifts and
[2:09:18] the speaking gifts say something and
[2:09:20] they do it under vocal inspiration and
[2:09:23] they are gifts of utterance and that is
[2:09:25] the gift of tongues the gift of
[2:09:27] interpretation of tongues and the gift
[2:09:29] of prophecy we refer to those three
[2:09:32] gifts as speaking gifts and it's easy
[2:09:34] for you to see why is that right
[2:09:37] all right now the next three
[2:09:39] the next three are called healing
[2:09:42] hearing hearing gifts
[2:09:45] because they reveal something
[2:09:47] and they are referred to as gifts of
[2:09:50] revelation
[2:09:51] and they are number one discerning or
[2:09:54] distinguishing spirits
[2:09:56] number two word of knowledge
[2:09:58] number three words of wisdom all three
[2:10:01] of these gifts
[2:10:03] operate by the spirit of the lord
[2:10:05] telling you something
[2:10:07] making something real to you
[2:10:10] clearly
[2:10:12] revealing the mind of god
[2:10:14] in a particular situation a spiritual
[2:10:18] knowledge
[2:10:19] that you didn't know how i'll give you
[2:10:21] an example in a moment something you
[2:10:22] didn't know about you you didn't have
[2:10:24] any earthly knowledge of it and the
[2:10:26] spirit of the lord just drops that right
[2:10:28] down into your heart i want you to know
[2:10:30] that's not just for preachers
[2:10:31] [Music]
[2:10:34] let me just use this in a very carnal
[2:10:36] way here
[2:10:38] brother steve i want i'm going to pick
[2:10:40] on you a minute is that all right
[2:10:42] did you say great
[2:10:44] oh go ahead
[2:10:46] all right
[2:10:47] i thought to myself i've never had
[2:10:48] anybody so anxious to be picked on
[2:10:50] great he said but but i think he won't
[2:10:53] mind this now he's a he is a a floor
[2:10:56] layer he's a carpet layer and a and do
[2:10:58] you do tile or just you do tile to he's
[2:11:01] a flooring man
[2:11:03] and uh i know that he has probably got
[2:11:06] into situations now first of all he
[2:11:08] prays over every job
[2:11:10] that's his testimony praise over every
[2:11:12] job
[2:11:13] and he has told me and and i know
[2:11:16] because he came in one day when we were
[2:11:18] having some work done in our home and
[2:11:20] got right down in the middle of the
[2:11:22] concrete floor put one hand in the air
[2:11:25] and called on the lord to come and help
[2:11:26] us to get that job done
[2:11:28] i tell you that's faith
[2:11:30] that's what i believe in
[2:11:32] if i know anything about him i pray i
[2:11:34] know he's probably really smart at what
[2:11:36] he does but there have probably been
[2:11:38] times along the way that he ran into a
[2:11:40] situation with flooring that he wasn't
[2:11:42] exactly sure
[2:11:44] immediately how to handle
[2:11:47] so he's sitting there scratching his
[2:11:48] head and trying he's already prayed and
[2:11:50] asked the lord to help him so he need
[2:11:53] not be shocked
[2:11:56] he need not be surprised
[2:11:59] when the spirit of the lord drops
[2:12:00] something down a thought comes into his
[2:12:02] head and says you know if you do it that
[2:12:05] way and turn it that way just a little
[2:12:06] bit mark that right there and come right
[2:12:08] back in from this angle the problem
[2:12:10] would be solved
[2:12:16] i could go all the way around this room
[2:12:19] i'm sure there's been a gutter job
[2:12:22] that even all the years of experience of
[2:12:24] hanging rain gutters
[2:12:26] they're they're just
[2:12:27] the mind just sometimes goes blank
[2:12:30] and you're trying to figure out what to
[2:12:31] do next and all of a sudden
[2:12:33] you may not even know
[2:12:36] that it's divine
[2:12:38] but if you've asked the lord for help
[2:12:40] don't be so shocked
[2:12:44] i've had women tell me i ruined the
[2:12:47] recipe
[2:12:48] i bet sisters tell me i ruined the
[2:12:50] recipe and i knew my husband was gonna
[2:12:52] be crazy
[2:12:55] oh yeah they tell about you they talk
[2:12:57] about you sometime
[2:12:59] and i wanted to fix it there was too
[2:13:02] much invested in the ingredient and i
[2:13:05] wanted to fix it and all of a sudden i
[2:13:07] just said lord help me
[2:13:15] and the idea came
[2:13:18] how i might try to take it in a
[2:13:19] different direction
[2:13:22] all right look at me now at least you're
[2:13:24] listening
[2:13:25] i got the lady's attentions
[2:13:28] see you had no business throwing it all
[2:13:29] out
[2:13:32] my little old mama when she would mess
[2:13:35] up a layer
[2:13:36] on a layer cake
[2:13:38] she would get so aggravated with herself
[2:13:40] that she'd put her whole hand down
[2:13:42] through the layer
[2:13:45] it would aggravate her so bad she'd just
[2:13:47] put her whole hand down through the
[2:13:49] layer and pick it up by the wax paper
[2:13:51] and toss it
[2:13:54] and guess what us kids would be doing
[2:13:55] chasing her to the garbage can
[2:14:00] we don't care what it looks like
[2:14:06] we don't even need frosting
[2:14:09] just give it to us
[2:14:10] i know that whatever situation you're in
[2:14:14] and you ask the lord to help you
[2:14:17] i know that some of you have had
[2:14:20] an inspiration drop in
[2:14:24] and you all of a sudden had knowledge
[2:14:27] on what to do about a particular
[2:14:29] situation
[2:14:30] i know parents that have prayed god help
[2:14:32] me with my kids i don't know what to do
[2:14:33] with them next i don't know what to say
[2:14:35] to them i don't even know how to talk to
[2:14:36] them
[2:14:37] help me lord and all of a sudden a
[2:14:40] thought dropped down in your mind and if
[2:14:42] you approach it this way they'll listen
[2:14:43] to you
[2:14:47] i know you'd like to think that you're
[2:14:48] just so smart
[2:14:51] that you think thunk of all those things
[2:14:53] on your own but i want you to know that
[2:14:55] may have very well been an operation of
[2:14:59] the holy spirit in your life bringing
[2:15:01] knowledge to you that you did not
[2:15:03] previously have and helping you get out
[2:15:06] from under a load or out of a messy
[2:15:09] situation
[2:15:11] and somebody said what are we to learn
[2:15:13] from that ask the lord
[2:15:16] if he has filled you with the holy ghost
[2:15:18] don't be ashamed to ask him to help you
[2:15:24] listen my little baptist granny believed
[2:15:26] that you shouldn't trouble the lord
[2:15:29] she believed that you shouldn't ask god
[2:15:31] about little things
[2:15:33] he was too busy keeping the stars in in
[2:15:36] orbit and and the planets there and she
[2:15:38] believed most of her life that god did
[2:15:41] not want to be bothered
[2:15:44] he's not the only one we know people
[2:15:46] like that all around us
[2:15:47] she believed that god didn't want to be
[2:15:49] bothered but her problem one day i took
[2:15:50] her and sat her down and i opened up my
[2:15:53] bible and i began to read to her
[2:15:55] scripture after scripture after
[2:15:57] scripture
[2:15:58] and i showed her writing god's word
[2:16:00] where he said cast your cares on me
[2:16:02] because i care for you mama do you know
[2:16:05] what that means she said what does it
[2:16:06] mean i said if you care about it
[2:16:11] god cares about it
[2:16:13] whatever you're concerned about he's
[2:16:16] concerned about whatever you care about
[2:16:19] god cares about
[2:16:21] and you don't have to be ashamed to
[2:16:23] kneel down let's kneel right down here
[2:16:25] and tell the lord whatever it is that's
[2:16:27] on your heart and i want you to know my
[2:16:30] grandmother went from being a sunday
[2:16:32] christian
[2:16:34] my mama's mama went from being a sunday
[2:16:37] christian to being a prayer warrior
[2:16:40] because she discovered that god cared
[2:16:42] about her needs and what she was worried
[2:16:44] about and what she was concerned about
[2:16:45] and i want you to know she would get on
[2:16:47] my nerves
[2:16:51] because i would be busy doing something
[2:16:53] she said did you pray about it
[2:16:57] and i'd say well granny i prayed you
[2:16:59] don't want to woke up she said we've got
[2:17:00] to pray about it now
[2:17:02] she said you're the one that messed this
[2:17:03] up you're the one that taught me this
[2:17:06] she said we're not going to go any
[2:17:07] further until we stop and ask the lord
[2:17:11] for his help we taught our children when
[2:17:13] they were learning their schoolwork that
[2:17:15] god cares about that
[2:17:18] and when you get to a situation that you
[2:17:20] can't grasp he wants to help you with
[2:17:23] that if you ask him do you ever get the
[2:17:25] idea that we as christians are living
[2:17:27] below our privileges
[2:17:30] because we don't understand that the
[2:17:31] spirit of christ has come to live within
[2:17:33] us by the power of the holy ghost to
[2:17:36] help us
[2:17:38] in so many different areas of our life
[2:17:40] are you still there
[2:17:42] and a wisdom
[2:17:44] have you ever been in the presence of
[2:17:46] someone and and all of a sudden
[2:17:49] they give an answer of wisdom
[2:17:51] and you wonder where in the world they
[2:17:52] get that
[2:17:57] wow that person i i've seen them when
[2:17:59] they didn't seem like they had enough
[2:18:00] sense to get out of the rain
[2:18:02] and now they're speaking as with the
[2:18:04] oracles of god
[2:18:05] speaking wisdom into a situation that
[2:18:08] solves every facet of the problem where
[2:18:10] did that wisdom come from
[2:18:12] i want you to know i've seen young men
[2:18:14] i've seen young women i've seen children
[2:18:17] speak with wisdoms that i knew were way
[2:18:21] beyond their potential inability at that
[2:18:23] moment
[2:18:25] and recognize that god was imparting
[2:18:27] through the gift of the spirit a wisdom
[2:18:30] in their life that they had not yet
[2:18:31] reached a maturity to be able to even
[2:18:33] grasp that is the goodness so are you
[2:18:36] sure you don't want the holy spirit
[2:18:37] gifts working in your life are you sure
[2:18:39] you want to put them out and say they're
[2:18:40] not for today how about we just let god
[2:18:43] keep working in us the way he desires to
[2:18:46] work in us
[2:18:47] are you with me
[2:18:49] and then the last three and we'll move
[2:18:51] on the last three are the doing gifts
[2:18:53] they do something
[2:18:55] they're gifts of power
[2:18:57] to every man is given a measure of faith
[2:19:00] every man is given a measure of faith
[2:19:02] but i want you to know there's a gift of
[2:19:03] faith
[2:19:04] there's a super sense of faith that god
[2:19:06] can drop down in your heart when you
[2:19:08] least expect it
[2:19:10] and a faith come out of you that you
[2:19:11] didn't even know you carried in here
[2:19:13] with you just a faith that said i know
[2:19:15] that i know that i know that i know that
[2:19:16] i know
[2:19:19] i know that god is going to move on our
[2:19:22] behalf
[2:19:23] and underneath those doing gifts there
[2:19:25] are also gifts of power gifts of healing
[2:19:28] and gifts of miracles
[2:19:30] these are the power gifts
[2:19:32] we talked about the revelation gifts and
[2:19:35] we talked about the utterance gifts
[2:19:38] now i want to read you something from we
[2:19:39] would see jesus are you up for that i
[2:19:42] need a few more minutes
[2:19:44] paragraph 77
[2:19:46] now if you believers
[2:19:48] you said how many believers in here if i
[2:19:51] could not do it
[2:19:53] if then he said i could not do it i
[2:19:56] cannot bring him
[2:20:00] it takes all of us together to do it
[2:20:04] he said i'm just a part of him
[2:20:07] and you're a part of him
[2:20:10] but if you're sick and needy i'm your
[2:20:12] brother
[2:20:15] god set in the church
[2:20:18] now there's nine spiritual gifts goes in
[2:20:23] each
[2:20:25] local
[2:20:26] body
[2:20:29] we call that the local church or the
[2:20:30] local assembly
[2:20:32] where you're sitting this morning
[2:20:34] and the prophet is clear
[2:20:36] that in every local church in every
[2:20:40] local body in every local assembly the
[2:20:44] nine gifts are to be given
[2:20:46] god is not a giver who gives and takes
[2:20:49] back
[2:20:50] he's a giver who gives and keeps on
[2:20:52] giving this is his character the way
[2:20:55] some people try to understand theology
[2:20:57] they try to take god out of his own
[2:20:59] character
[2:21:00] it is not his character to give
[2:21:01] something to you and then you get used
[2:21:03] to having it and he took it back
[2:21:06] in fact god's character doesn't diminish
[2:21:10] his character increases
[2:21:12] is anybody following what i'm saying
[2:21:15] i'm so thankful that you are now in
[2:21:17] these nine spiritual gifts given to each
[2:21:19] local body here's a listing of them he
[2:21:21] doesn't name them all i don't think he
[2:21:22] may but i don't think he does here he
[2:21:24] said which is tongues interpretation of
[2:21:26] tongues and prophecies and so forth i
[2:21:29] just read all nine of them to you
[2:21:31] he didn't read them all nine here but he
[2:21:33] read tongues interpretation of tongues
[2:21:35] prophecies and so forth he mentions the
[2:21:37] three utterance gifts
[2:21:39] but there is five predestinated offices
[2:21:42] of the church nine spiritual gifts to
[2:21:44] the church and five predestinated
[2:21:46] offices of the church
[2:21:48] and those offices are apostles prophets
[2:21:50] teachers pastors and evangelists
[2:21:53] and brother branham says that's what god
[2:21:56] set
[2:21:57] in the church
[2:21:59] now in this quote he indicates that the
[2:22:01] five ministerial offices
[2:22:04] or the ascension gifts that they're
[2:22:06] called sometime are given to the church
[2:22:09] and he says that the nine spiritual
[2:22:11] gifts are given to the local body
[2:22:13] there's a little difference there but he
[2:22:15] doesn't always say it that way but i
[2:22:17] just wanted to point that out as we move
[2:22:19] on
[2:22:20] he said the holy spirit that's the
[2:22:22] office the holy spirit might fall on one
[2:22:25] tonight
[2:22:27] and speak in tongues and the other give
[2:22:29] prophecy and so forth
[2:22:30] and the next night it might be on
[2:22:33] somebody else and somebody else like
[2:22:36] that
[2:22:37] he said that's local gifts
[2:22:41] in the body
[2:22:43] to
[2:22:49] now if we don't allow the gifts to be in
[2:22:51] the body
[2:22:52] guess what happens we get crooked
[2:23:00] don't you sit back there and think that
[2:23:01] i'm teaching you that only the pulpit
[2:23:03] has the gifts
[2:23:07] this has never been that kind of a
[2:23:08] church
[2:23:11] i came here in 1990
[2:23:13] and from 1990 until this day
[2:23:16] the gifts of the spirit have been
[2:23:18] welcomed
[2:23:19] to operate not only from the platform or
[2:23:22] as granny used to call the rostrum
[2:23:24] not only from the platform
[2:23:26] but in the
[2:23:28] local body of believers in the pew in
[2:23:32] the church
[2:23:33] now there's an order to how those gifts
[2:23:35] operate in here
[2:23:37] but we want them
[2:23:39] and we welcome them
[2:23:40] we understand that the gifts don't
[2:23:42] interrupt the gifts
[2:23:43] there's a right time there's a right
[2:23:45] order there's a right atmosphere is
[2:23:47] anybody in agreement
[2:23:49] we understand that now he goes on here
[2:23:52] said that that's local gifts
[2:23:55] in the body to keep us straight
[2:23:58] but in the church alone
[2:24:00] five offices apostles and here brother
[2:24:03] branham says means missionaries in other
[2:24:06] places he said it means sent ones which
[2:24:09] is what missionaries do
[2:24:11] he never distinguishes that it's
[2:24:14] foreign missionaries only
[2:24:17] but he mentions that it is one who is
[2:24:19] sent with a message
[2:24:20] have you ever been sent with a message
[2:24:23] prophets teachers pastors and
[2:24:26] evangelists god sets those in the church
[2:24:30] he said now let's believe with all our
[2:24:32] heart that through these ministering
[2:24:33] gifts that the great god of heaven will
[2:24:35] send christ among us tonight that we'll
[2:24:38] see jesus
[2:24:39] he said let us now pray and bow our
[2:24:40] heads i want to give you one more as i
[2:24:43] thought on my way
[2:24:45] is the name of this sermon it's from
[2:24:46] chicago ohio and i'm reading it because
[2:24:48] i want everyone who watches this to
[2:24:51] understand
[2:24:53] that these gifts are given to the local
[2:24:55] body and then i'm going to take the last
[2:24:57] few minutes that i have and speak
[2:24:58] specifically about one of those gifts
[2:25:02] in paragraph 63 he said sometimes
[2:25:04] now god he's god
[2:25:07] oral robert says he's a good god and
[2:25:09] that's true he's a good god and yet he's
[2:25:12] more than a good god he's a god of wrath
[2:25:14] too
[2:25:17] now that's a god that the american
[2:25:18] church don't want to talk about
[2:25:21] they don't talk about the fact there's a
[2:25:23] penalty for sin
[2:25:24] and there's consequences for our choices
[2:25:27] but how many of you know the truth of
[2:25:28] the word is there are consequences for
[2:25:30] our choices good bad or ugly they're
[2:25:33] there he said he's more than a good god
[2:25:35] he's a god of wrath too don't you think
[2:25:36] he's too good now don't you think he
[2:25:38] excuse me don't you think he's too good
[2:25:41] now that he won't he won't keep his word
[2:25:44] and he will excuse you so don't you get
[2:25:46] this idea that god will turn away from
[2:25:49] his word because he likes you
[2:25:53] he's going to hold on to his word he
[2:25:55] never does that his holiness requires
[2:25:57] him to be
[2:25:58] just i want you to say he's a just god
[2:26:02] he is a just god he's a just god besides
[2:26:05] a good god
[2:26:06] he's good but he also requires justice
[2:26:08] and his law requires him to be just he
[2:26:10] must keep it so then he's a god of wrath
[2:26:13] also so there's the balance
[2:26:16] and said now remember when if you
[2:26:17] wouldn't take my word for it or i
[2:26:19] wouldn't take your word that would
[2:26:21] settle it but but not god
[2:26:24] god sends gifts into the church to steal
[2:26:29] to be sure that everyone will be without
[2:26:32] an excuse
[2:26:38] now one of the main things that we have
[2:26:40] understood from the message is judgment
[2:26:42] cannot fall
[2:26:43] unless a warning goes forth
[2:26:46] first know what i'd like for you folks
[2:26:49] to do
[2:26:50] and i know it's get maybe a little
[2:26:51] personal say this i would like for you
[2:26:53] to take a tour
[2:26:55] on the website
[2:26:58] i would like for you to go back to the
[2:26:59] media page for just a moment and i would
[2:27:02] like for you to go back and just look at
[2:27:04] titles
[2:27:06] some of you have a good enough memory
[2:27:08] that if you saw the title of a sermon
[2:27:09] you'd begin to remember parts of that
[2:27:11] message
[2:27:12] i want you to go back and i want you to
[2:27:14] look at how god has been so gracious
[2:27:17] and so good to instruct us even over the
[2:27:21] last two to three years
[2:27:23] to help prepare us for what he wants to
[2:27:25] do among us
[2:27:26] i don't know how many times he has come
[2:27:28] to say you ought to deal with this this
[2:27:30] ought to be dealt with you ought to take
[2:27:32] this to the lord you ought to put this
[2:27:33] up before for me you you ought to let me
[2:27:36] you ought to let me deal with this
[2:27:38] i don't know how many times god has said
[2:27:40] i don't know how many times a cry has
[2:27:42] gone forth from this pulpit come get
[2:27:44] help
[2:27:47] i've tried multiple things
[2:27:49] i've realized that there are people
[2:27:51] among us who don't have confidence full
[2:27:53] confidence in me i understand that it
[2:27:55] happens
[2:27:56] and so i've tried on several occasions
[2:27:59] to offer brother greeley
[2:28:02] as an alternative
[2:28:04] to come down here and minister to
[2:28:05] anybody in here that's got an ought
[2:28:07] against me
[2:28:09] if there's anybody oh you're getting
[2:28:10] personal no no i'm just really telling
[2:28:12] you how it works
[2:28:14] i want people to be helped
[2:28:16] if i can help you if you've got so many
[2:28:18] things against me if you do and people
[2:28:21] do sometime if you do then i wanted you
[2:28:23] to know there's somebody else i also
[2:28:26] want you to know that in this body there
[2:28:28] are people sitting right here among you
[2:28:30] who have gifts to pray for you
[2:28:33] and you hear me sometimes say lay your
[2:28:35] hand over if you're if you don't mind
[2:28:38] now i know there are people that don't
[2:28:39] want to be touched
[2:28:40] i just tell you i don't think i'd be
[2:28:42] settled in a pentecostal church if i
[2:28:43] didn't want to get close
[2:28:46] i don't like standing up and sitting
[2:28:47] down in church well then i think i'd
[2:28:49] find me a liturgical church somewhere
[2:28:53] because if you come to a pentecostal
[2:28:55] church it's going to be up and down up
[2:28:56] and down up now let's all stand let's
[2:28:58] all see it let's all stand let's all see
[2:28:59] it
[2:29:01] and you come around here and people
[2:29:02] stand when they're not even told to
[2:29:04] stand they just stand
[2:29:05] they just get caught up in the
[2:29:07] inspiration of things so i recognize
[2:29:09] that everybody likes things different
[2:29:10] and i understand that even a man of god
[2:29:13] even men of god have personalities
[2:29:15] we do we don't lose our personality
[2:29:17] because we're called
[2:29:19] in fact god calls us because of who we
[2:29:20] are you do understand that don't you and
[2:29:23] if we all were just alike
[2:29:26] what a boring five-fold ministry that
[2:29:28] would be
[2:29:29] if we all ministered in just the same
[2:29:30] way that's why no preacher should try to
[2:29:32] imitate another preacher in his delivery
[2:29:38] everybody ought to just be exactly what
[2:29:39] god has called them to be and function
[2:29:41] in that ministry because there's going
[2:29:43] to be somebody out there that needs that
[2:29:45] so when i recognize through the years
[2:29:48] that there were people sitting in the
[2:29:49] church who had an ought against me and
[2:29:51] who had limited my ability to be able to
[2:29:54] minister to them or their children
[2:29:56] then i have stood in this pulpit
[2:29:59] and said brother greeley will come and
[2:30:01] he will minute i want you to come if you
[2:30:03] have a need
[2:30:05] i've said to people in the in the
[2:30:07] sanctuary if god should lay on your
[2:30:09] heart
[2:30:10] to go and minister to somebody i want
[2:30:13] you to feel freedom to do that as long
[2:30:15] as you know it's the lord
[2:30:17] why do i say that because i don't want
[2:30:18] you to get punched in the mouth
[2:30:22] you need to know when you're going to
[2:30:24] somebody
[2:30:25] that they've got a heart to receive you
[2:30:26] in some way you know what i'm saying
[2:30:27] especially if it's somebody you don't
[2:30:29] know
[2:30:30] if it's somebody you know you might
[2:30:31] punch them back
[2:30:33] if it's somebody you don't know i would
[2:30:35] rather you not do that
[2:30:37] what i mean by that is we all have a
[2:30:40] burden for one another at times we see
[2:30:42] someone is struggling
[2:30:44] and i have watched people in this church
[2:30:46] go and try to minister to needs and
[2:30:48] watch people stiffen up like like
[2:30:51] zombies like like
[2:30:53] two befores
[2:30:57] because
[2:30:58] sometimes people so overthink every
[2:31:00] situation
[2:31:02] that they think there's some dark motive
[2:31:05] at work
[2:31:07] and they're not coming to pray for me
[2:31:09] because they want to help me they're
[2:31:10] coming to embarrass me or they're coming
[2:31:12] because they think i've got a devil or
[2:31:14] they're coming because they think i'm in
[2:31:16] sin let me tell you something i think
[2:31:18] there comes a time we ought to shut off
[2:31:20] our thinker
[2:31:21] and just enter into the presence of the
[2:31:23] lord because we may think ourselves
[2:31:26] right out of a touch from god
[2:31:28] i just want to say to this church this
[2:31:30] morning and this is not an election or a
[2:31:32] vote of confidence but i just want to
[2:31:35] say to this church this morning that you
[2:31:37] and i know
[2:31:38] for sure that every person has had
[2:31:41] opportunity after opportunity after
[2:31:43] opportunity after opportunity to receive
[2:31:46] help
[2:31:48] if not from the pastor then the
[2:31:50] associate pastor and if not from the
[2:31:52] associate pastor from the
[2:31:54] body of believers
[2:31:57] there's one thing that is required to be
[2:32:00] able to get help and that is you've got
[2:32:01] to know you need it
[2:32:05] and if somebody is so stubborn
[2:32:08] that they don't seem to recognize their
[2:32:10] need
[2:32:12] it doesn't matter who goes to them
[2:32:14] it doesn't matter who's praying for them
[2:32:17] it doesn't matter how many greeting
[2:32:18] cards you give them
[2:32:20] until somebody is willing to receive
[2:32:22] help
[2:32:26] that's why we try different ways of
[2:32:28] getting people to get help i don't think
[2:32:30] you have to come up here
[2:32:33] i think god will meet you right where
[2:32:34] you are
[2:32:36] he met us a little while ago listen we
[2:32:38] had something unusual this morning we
[2:32:40] had a special song given from the pew
[2:32:43] and the spirit of god just ministered
[2:32:44] all over this room and i was uh
[2:32:47] conchita i'm getting uh comments here
[2:32:50] from around the world oh what a song
[2:32:53] what a voice what an anointing
[2:32:56] how that touched my life
[2:32:59] and that was a little different than
[2:33:00] ordinary
[2:33:02] i like a god of variety
[2:33:04] i like when god goes beyond above and
[2:33:07] beyond to touch our lives and to reach
[2:33:10] out for us
[2:33:11] i guess what i'm trying to say is we
[2:33:13] have no excuse
[2:33:15] to sit service after service after
[2:33:17] service after service and not receive
[2:33:19] any kind of help at all when help is
[2:33:21] available to us
[2:33:23] oh yes well how do you know i'm not
[2:33:25] getting it home well i want you to know
[2:33:27] that if you're getting that kind of help
[2:33:28] at home in your quiet time i love that
[2:33:31] that's relationship we need that but
[2:33:33] don't forget that when you come to god's
[2:33:35] house bring your help with you
[2:33:40] if you can be jovial and you can be easy
[2:33:43] to get along with and you can be a fun
[2:33:45] outside church then don't come here and
[2:33:48] act like some sober judge
[2:33:53] come here and allow the holy spirit to
[2:33:55] touch you
[2:33:56] because if you indeed are god's child
[2:33:58] not only does he want to help you he may
[2:34:00] want to bring you to a place that you
[2:34:02] can help somebody else
[2:34:05] when i was sitting here on this platform
[2:34:06] today the lord quickened the scripture
[2:34:08] in my heart i had to get my phone out
[2:34:10] real quick to find it but it was a
[2:34:12] rebuke that jesus gave to the religious
[2:34:14] elders and order the religious elite of
[2:34:16] his day
[2:34:18] and he said i've got a problem with you
[2:34:19] because you won't go in
[2:34:22] you won't go into what god's trying to
[2:34:24] do and you stand in the way
[2:34:28] you stand in the door and you won't let
[2:34:30] other people go in
[2:34:32] can i tell you church this morning that
[2:34:34] that truly we have influence
[2:34:39] every one of us have influence in our
[2:34:41] life over somebody and when you won't
[2:34:45] run for god's best when you won't reach
[2:34:47] out to have god's best in your life not
[2:34:50] only do you miss
[2:34:52] but somebody who's looking to you for a
[2:34:54] little bit of help and stability is
[2:34:56] missing also if you can't run on for god
[2:34:59] for yourself look around oh i don't mean
[2:35:02] to get so wild now but look around at
[2:35:05] your own children
[2:35:07] look around at your own teenagers if you
[2:35:10] don't want to get help for yourself run
[2:35:11] to god on their behalf
[2:35:15] so that they can get help
[2:35:17] don't be like the pharisees of the days
[2:35:19] of jesus who stood in the door
[2:35:22] refusing to go in and lead others into
[2:35:24] what god had prepared for them in that
[2:35:26] day which was the reality of who jesus
[2:35:28] was god was now on the scene working
[2:35:31] among them are you still here
[2:35:33] we're nearly done
[2:35:35] god sends gifts into the church to steal
[2:35:37] to be sure that everyone will be without
[2:35:39] an excuse some of these gifts are oh
[2:35:41] well there's nine spiritual gifts that
[2:35:43] goes into every local body
[2:35:46] i could read you hundreds of paragraphs
[2:35:49] where he says every local body he said
[2:35:51] how many believes that first corinthians
[2:35:53] 12 that's speaking with tongues
[2:35:54] interpretation of tongues and gifts of
[2:35:56] prophecy and discernments and all the
[2:35:58] different wisdom and knowledge and gifts
[2:36:00] of healing and all that goes into what
[2:36:03] in the local body
[2:36:05] so don't try to tell me that the nine
[2:36:07] spiritual gifts are just for the for the
[2:36:09] body of christ at large and they may not
[2:36:11] be operational in every local assembly
[2:36:14] they ought to be
[2:36:15] because if you've got one holy ghost
[2:36:18] filled believer in a church you've got
[2:36:20] the potential for all nine gifts of the
[2:36:22] spirit to function if there was only one
[2:36:24] that he could flow through
[2:36:27] we're not talking about offices
[2:36:30] but the brand is very clear that the
[2:36:31] gift of prophecy and the office of a
[2:36:33] prophet are two totally different gifts
[2:36:36] altogether one is an office for the
[2:36:38] church and one is a gift to the local
[2:36:40] body
[2:36:41] in fact he's teaching us that one may
[2:36:43] prophesy and never prophesy again
[2:36:45] because he was not called as a prophet
[2:36:47] he was called to be used only with a
[2:36:48] gift of prophecy these things are not
[2:36:51] confusing if we take a little time to
[2:36:52] read the word right it's their force i'm
[2:36:55] hurrying and then there's five
[2:36:56] ministerial offices how many believes
[2:36:58] that sure and that's apostles prophets
[2:37:00] teachers pastors evangelists and how
[2:37:01] many knows that he's asking us several
[2:37:03] times do you know that and i do know
[2:37:05] that how many of you know that
[2:37:08] all right he goes on now how can you say
[2:37:10] there's a pastor or evangelist without
[2:37:12] saying there's a prophet
[2:37:14] now you may think that brother vandam is
[2:37:16] talking about word prophets here but
[2:37:17] he's talking about five fold prophets
[2:37:21] may i just be clear and tell you that
[2:37:22] brother branham was not a prophet after
[2:37:24] the fivefold ministry
[2:37:25] but agabus was
[2:37:29] brother branham was not functioning in
[2:37:31] the five-fold office of a prophet he was
[2:37:33] functioning under under the under a word
[2:37:36] prophesied ministry
[2:37:38] which places an authority there that
[2:37:40] doesn't mean that we worship should
[2:37:41] worship a man or or or just stand in awe
[2:37:44] of the gift or the office that a man
[2:37:46] carries but we must recognize
[2:37:50] that this was a gift that was prophesied
[2:37:52] to forerun the second coming of jesus
[2:37:54] christ and he has been faithful to do
[2:37:56] that whether you can see it or not it
[2:37:58] doesn't change god's economy from being
[2:38:00] fulfilled right before my eyes and
[2:38:02] that's what i'm going to fellowship
[2:38:04] around the last day i live on planet
[2:38:06] earth you will find me somewhere around
[2:38:08] that message
[2:38:10] around that word
[2:38:11] because it's life-changing for those who
[2:38:14] will open up their hearts and let it i
[2:38:16] wouldn't turn myself back now into a
[2:38:18] denominational system you don't have
[2:38:20] enough money in your 401 to turn my life
[2:38:24] back to that system
[2:38:26] i'm just being honest i don't want that
[2:38:28] anymore i've seen the politics of
[2:38:30] churchianity i'm not interested in
[2:38:32] church entity politics anymore i want to
[2:38:34] gather around the word
[2:38:36] anybody with me
[2:38:38] where are we at now uh uh how can you
[2:38:41] say there's a prophet when there's not
[2:38:43] when there isn't an apostle see some
[2:38:44] people like to say oh there's pastors
[2:38:46] evangelists and teachers that's only
[2:38:47] threefold
[2:38:49] but they don't want to say prophets
[2:38:51] they don't want to talk about apostles
[2:38:53] he said the same god said teachers and
[2:38:54] evangelists said prophets he keeps his
[2:38:56] word we don't pin knife it
[2:38:59] we don't cut out what we don't like
[2:39:01] it just
[2:39:02] preach it that's what god's up it's up
[2:39:05] to god to take care of his own word
[2:39:06] don't you believe that that's a question
[2:39:09] i'm moving on he said now a prophet in
[2:39:11] the gift of prophecy is two different
[2:39:12] things
[2:39:13] how many knows that a gift of prophecy
[2:39:15] works through the church a prophet is
[2:39:16] born to prophet jeremiah now he goes
[2:39:19] back to a word order here he's
[2:39:20] describing it more as a word order
[2:39:22] jeremiah was born to prophet even before
[2:39:24] he ever formed in his mother's womb god
[2:39:27] made him a prophet and ordained him a
[2:39:29] prophet over the nations this is what
[2:39:31] the bible said so it's indisputable
[2:39:34] you believe it's indisputable
[2:39:36] so john 712 years before he was born
[2:39:40] isaiah saw him the voice of one crying
[2:39:42] in the wilderness jesus christ was a
[2:39:44] woman's seed from the garden of eden he
[2:39:45] couldn't be nothing else but jesus
[2:39:47] christ the son of god
[2:39:50] moses was born to prophecy prophets are
[2:39:52] not made it isn't laying on of hands and
[2:39:54] giving gifts it's something that god
[2:39:55] gave god have set in the church
[2:39:58] first apostles then prophets others are
[2:40:00] local gifts that goes into the church
[2:40:02] now the lord is with us we believe and
[2:40:04] we will do those and will do these
[2:40:07] things for us i'm trying to be uh
[2:40:11] reading too quickly now
[2:40:13] now in the few minutes that i have left
[2:40:15] and i know i must stop
[2:40:17] i want to speak for just a moment about
[2:40:19] one little aspect of the gift of
[2:40:21] discerning of spirits would you like to
[2:40:22] know what that is
[2:40:24] if you don't know would you like to know
[2:40:25] that's a good question and i want to
[2:40:27] know let me tell you what it's not
[2:40:30] the gift of discerning of spirits is not
[2:40:31] the gift of suspicion
[2:40:37] no such gift
[2:40:38] nine spiritual gifts all put up there on
[2:40:41] the board for you and none of them the
[2:40:42] gift of suspicion
[2:40:46] spiritually minded people can get a
[2:40:47] little off track sometime
[2:40:52] i believe in cleaning your house
[2:40:55] i do i believe there's things in our
[2:40:57] homes that ought not to be there
[2:40:58] and i think that some of us would have a
[2:41:00] lot more victory in christ if we'd get
[2:41:02] some of that stuff out of our house
[2:41:05] anybody with me
[2:41:07] oh it's getting quiet
[2:41:09] i'm counting on you you can't leave me
[2:41:10] now
[2:41:12] we we would do so much better if some of
[2:41:14] us would would make up our mind listen
[2:41:16] the world is crazy after witchcraft now
[2:41:20] some of these games some of these video
[2:41:21] games that you all play there's a lot of
[2:41:23] witchcraft in that
[2:41:28] i don't want that
[2:41:30] i deal with enough spirits in my life
[2:41:33] that i don't want to put myself down in
[2:41:35] front of that kind of stuff and let it
[2:41:36] become a part of who i am
[2:41:38] it gets in your spiritual dna if you're
[2:41:40] not careful you open the door and the
[2:41:42] enemy doesn't wait to be invited
[2:41:44] if you open the door he just comes right
[2:41:46] through
[2:41:47] so i will tell you that there are people
[2:41:49] right here in this assembly that would
[2:41:51] have a whole lot more victory in your
[2:41:52] life if you didn't have a television
[2:41:58] just get rid of the thing it keeps
[2:42:00] tormenting your life
[2:42:02] you keep going back to the things that
[2:42:03] you've already made up your mind you
[2:42:05] don't want to put before your eyes you
[2:42:06] keep going back to them because it's
[2:42:08] convenient and easy to do so i wonder if
[2:42:10] anybody will help me preach
[2:42:13] some of you would be a whole lot better
[2:42:15] off and have a whole lot more victory in
[2:42:17] your life if you'd get rid of them old
[2:42:18] game boxes
[2:42:21] just watch how quiet it gets
[2:42:24] why now i understand that they're
[2:42:26] talking they talk to each other on them
[2:42:31] well that opens you up to a whole
[2:42:32] different world out there
[2:42:34] as we well know people meet folks out
[2:42:36] there like that just like a dating site
[2:42:45] i know you're ready to go
[2:42:47] i'm kind of ready to go too now
[2:42:50] i'm going to stick around another minute
[2:42:51] or two and if you do have to slip out
[2:42:52] nobody's going to talk about you and
[2:42:54] accuse you of being guilty of all them
[2:42:55] things
[2:43:00] i recently was in a room
[2:43:02] where somebody was in that room
[2:43:04] where i was
[2:43:06] it got really caught up in that gaming
[2:43:08] stuff
[2:43:09] a girl a woman
[2:43:11] a wife a mother
[2:43:15] she got caught up in that stuff
[2:43:17] i don't know if it was on headsets
[2:43:20] like people communicate with now i
[2:43:22] didn't even know that kind of stuff
[2:43:23] existed
[2:43:24] i think i'm a little bit tech savvy
[2:43:27] yes i admit it takes me a long time to
[2:43:29] add a contact
[2:43:35] it's complicated
[2:43:38] some of the amish said brother shelly i
[2:43:39] sure would like to get that friday text
[2:43:42] and the former amish that were here last
[2:43:44] weekend sure would like to get that
[2:43:45] friday text i said i'll be glad to send
[2:43:47] it to you let me get your contact
[2:43:48] information and you know what it would
[2:43:50] have been quicker just to hand them the
[2:43:51] phone
[2:43:55] just give it to brother truman
[2:43:58] or give it to brother some of them just
[2:44:00] let them add the contact because i'm
[2:44:03] sitting there i'm slow at this i'm sorry
[2:44:04] i'm slow at this i didn't even know they
[2:44:06] were talking to one another on
[2:44:08] walkie-talkies and headsets and can
[2:44:10] communicate
[2:44:11] like that
[2:44:17] i know there's apps on the phone where
[2:44:19] you can send messages to people and
[2:44:21] after a short amount of time they
[2:44:22] disappear
[2:44:24] i'd like to know where the
[2:44:25] accountability is in that
[2:44:30] i know there's things like that that you
[2:44:32] can send pictures to one another and
[2:44:34] after a little while they disappear i'd
[2:44:35] like to know where the accountability in
[2:44:37] that is
[2:44:39] i'd like for some of you parents to
[2:44:40] answer me that question
[2:44:42] you really want your children sending
[2:44:44] pictures and teenagers to one another
[2:44:45] like that and they disappear and nobody
[2:44:48] has any access to know what's going on
[2:44:50] you say well you just don't hardly trust
[2:44:52] anybody i'll tell you what i don't trust
[2:44:55] i don't trust the devil that's out to
[2:44:56] destroy he's out to kill and destroy
[2:44:59] he's out to tear up marriages
[2:45:02] he's aft after our children he'd like to
[2:45:04] take our teenagers and throw them right
[2:45:06] out into the midst of witchcraft way
[2:45:08] over their heads
[2:45:12] i can't believe you're talking like that
[2:45:13] with visitors here they need to hear it
[2:45:15] too
[2:45:17] everybody ought to hear it every now and
[2:45:18] again
[2:45:20] because they call it innocent
[2:45:23] the crazy church world called harry
[2:45:25] potter innocent
[2:45:29] it's just good literature
[2:45:31] this well-written literature they say
[2:45:34] not understanding that it opened up a
[2:45:36] world of imagination to to a host of a
[2:45:39] whole multitude of kids that had never
[2:45:42] even understood that that kind of stuff
[2:45:44] existed
[2:45:45] and even though it may be presented in
[2:45:47] the in the uh in the framework of
[2:45:49] fantasy
[2:45:51] i've had enough experience in the realm
[2:45:53] of witchcraft to know
[2:45:55] that it's very much real
[2:45:58] and i don't know if you've ever met
[2:45:59] anybody that's seen levitation or things
[2:46:01] like that but if you've met me you've
[2:46:02] met people like that i stood in my hotel
[2:46:05] room in india just a few years back i
[2:46:08] stood in my hotel room and looked out
[2:46:10] the window and watched a man not just
[2:46:13] one man but several men
[2:46:17] by the power of witchcraft
[2:46:19] and false religion
[2:46:21] levitate themselves off the ground
[2:46:25] and hover in the air without any tricks
[2:46:28] involved
[2:46:30] and those precious hindu people and and
[2:46:33] and sikhs and all these different
[2:46:35] religions that are represented they're
[2:46:37] throwing money in the street because
[2:46:39] they're afraid if they don't these men
[2:46:41] are going to curse them
[2:46:44] so don't tell me that these kind of
[2:46:45] things aren't real
[2:46:47] and don't tell me that the enemy is not
[2:46:49] looking for all kinds of ways no wonder
[2:46:51] i said a moment ago we need to be able
[2:46:53] to discern spirits
[2:46:58] so i knew this young lady who was i
[2:47:01] think maybe just typing chats
[2:47:04] i don't know if it was by voice or not
[2:47:07] just typing chats and the next thing you
[2:47:09] know a mother
[2:47:12] with several children and a husband
[2:47:15] had struck up
[2:47:17] an emotional affair with a man from
[2:47:19] another country
[2:47:25] all because of that private gaming
[2:47:32] and when exposed
[2:47:34] had to say to her husband
[2:47:37] i'm going to go and check him out
[2:47:43] i have to give this an opportunity a
[2:47:45] chance i have to give this a chance to
[2:47:47] see if this is something good for me
[2:47:49] it may be that i will leave and never
[2:47:51] come back
[2:47:56] and bought a plane ticket
[2:47:58] how would you like to be the husband
[2:48:00] left with the kids to know that your
[2:48:02] wife
[2:48:03] is leaving you to go off and check out
[2:48:05] another man in a foreign country to see
[2:48:08] if he might be something that she could
[2:48:10] count on
[2:48:12] i don't know what the man was left at
[2:48:14] home with her kids seems to me like he
[2:48:16] might be something you could count on
[2:48:22] and she goes
[2:48:24] and wasn't there but just a few hours
[2:48:26] and fear struck her heart
[2:48:28] and she realized with a reality that
[2:48:31] shook her to the very core you can be
[2:48:33] anything you want to be in the virtual
[2:48:35] world
[2:48:36] you can look like any picture you choose
[2:48:38] to look like
[2:48:41] you can portray yourself to be anything
[2:48:43] you want to portray yourself to be in a
[2:48:45] virtual world
[2:48:46] you know that's where this is all going
[2:48:48] you understand that that's what
[2:48:50] technology is doing is taking us in that
[2:48:52] kind of a direction where people will
[2:48:53] spend more time in a virtual reality
[2:48:55] than they do in the reality that we walk
[2:48:57] around in
[2:48:58] i'm not losing my mind i'm telling you
[2:49:00] that's what facebook has already
[2:49:01] announced they'd like to do
[2:49:03] and moving in that direction
[2:49:08] and then a fear struck that girl's heart
[2:49:10] and she was afraid that she might lose
[2:49:12] her life
[2:49:16] she made her way back
[2:49:18] to the airport
[2:49:20] and had to go through all the rigamarole
[2:49:22] i don't even remember if she was there
[2:49:23] one night she had to go through all the
[2:49:25] rigamarole
[2:49:27] of getting her ticket changed and
[2:49:29] getting herself back and how would you
[2:49:31] like to walk into a house where you've
[2:49:32] left your children with your husband and
[2:49:35] say i was wrong
[2:49:37] am i welcome to come home
[2:49:39] and every bit of that was because a door
[2:49:41] was opened
[2:49:43] and somebody wasn't discerning that this
[2:49:45] is a spirit that is not out to give you
[2:49:47] a better life this is a spirit that is
[2:49:50] out to kill you this is a spirit that's
[2:49:52] out to destroy your marriage this is a
[2:49:54] spirit that wants to steal your children
[2:49:56] right out from under your house is
[2:49:58] anybody with me i want to i want to say
[2:49:59] this and close as soon as i can we must
[2:50:02] have the gift of discerning of spirits i
[2:50:04] think we ought to pray as we get ready
[2:50:06] to leave here we everyone ought to pray
[2:50:08] lord if you have filled me with the holy
[2:50:09] ghost
[2:50:10] if i have the genuine holy ghost in my
[2:50:12] life i'm asking you to give me the grace
[2:50:15] and ability to discern any time i come
[2:50:18] in contact with a spirit that is not of
[2:50:20] christ
[2:50:23] i want you to know it's very very rare
[2:50:25] for the person that's being anointed by
[2:50:27] a false spirit to recognize
[2:50:30] that they're being used by a spirit
[2:50:32] until confronted by the word
[2:50:36] and if you confront that spirit by the
[2:50:38] word and the person that's underneath
[2:50:40] the influence of that spirit can then
[2:50:42] not recognize and realize when the word
[2:50:45] confronts the spirit and that person
[2:50:48] cannot realize that they're under the
[2:50:50] influence of a spirit that person is not
[2:50:52] just under the influence of a spirit
[2:50:54] they're deceived
[2:50:57] the bible said no you're not try you've
[2:50:59] got to try every spirit
[2:51:01] know you're not that these seducing
[2:51:02] spirits are going to come out into the
[2:51:04] world and they'll lie to people
[2:51:07] and people will believe the lie
[2:51:09] it's a very serious thing
[2:51:11] sometimes a spirit is really just
[2:51:13] carnality building up in our lives it
[2:51:15] has to be dealt with by the word and by
[2:51:18] the spirit the ability to discern
[2:51:20] between my flesh what my flesh is
[2:51:21] telling me and what the spirit is
[2:51:23] telling me
[2:51:24] but there are times that spirits are
[2:51:26] trying to work in your family
[2:51:32] they're out for destruction somebody
[2:51:34] said well you're just trying to make us
[2:51:35] fearful not at all
[2:51:36] i'm trying to tell you that god has
[2:51:38] given you power
[2:51:41] over all the powers of the enemy
[2:51:43] but it's very very dangerous not to be
[2:51:45] able to discern
[2:51:48] did you know the bible talks about
[2:51:50] blasphemy of the holy ghost
[2:51:52] and and the truest definition of
[2:51:54] blasphemy it's the only unpardonable sin
[2:51:56] the truest definition of blasphemy that
[2:51:58] we can find is not making fun of the
[2:52:00] holy ghost
[2:52:04] people say that's making fun of the holy
[2:52:05] ghost it's more than that
[2:52:08] the truest definition of blasphemy is
[2:52:10] attributing
[2:52:12] the works of god
[2:52:15] to the devil
[2:52:20] identifying what god is doing as the
[2:52:22] devil
[2:52:23] and it can be quite confusing in reverse
[2:52:27] to try to give god credit
[2:52:29] for what the enemy is doing
[2:52:31] it's a very very dangerous thing
[2:52:33] so i like to tell people all the time if
[2:52:35] somebody worships a little differently
[2:52:37] than you be careful what you say
[2:52:40] be careful how you call something of the
[2:52:42] devil
[2:52:43] if someone dresses a little different
[2:52:45] than you or acts a little different than
[2:52:46] you be careful what kind of label you
[2:52:48] put on it
[2:52:49] because truly as musicians are coming
[2:52:52] truly in this hour we need to ask the
[2:52:55] lord for the discerning of spirits to be
[2:52:58] able to recognize when something is a
[2:53:00] spirit and when something is not
[2:53:03] we are not to be suspicious
[2:53:07] we are to be led by the spirit how many
[2:53:10] of you have the holy ghost i'm not
[2:53:11] looking but i want you to identify
[2:53:12] yourself
[2:53:13] if you have the baptism of the holy
[2:53:15] ghost you have every right to ask the
[2:53:18] lord this morning lord
[2:53:20] i want you to help me exercise the gift
[2:53:25] of discerning of spirits in my life i
[2:53:27] want to recognize what is me
[2:53:35] and what is the influence of a spirit
[2:53:39] that is not me
[2:53:40] but it's something trying to trouble my
[2:53:43] life
[2:53:44] let me ask you a question in closing is
[2:53:46] there anybody in this room that has
[2:53:49] experienced this kind of thing before
[2:53:51] and you have recognized in your life
[2:53:53] [Music]
[2:53:55] that you had fallen under the influence
[2:53:58] of a spirit that was not christ
[2:53:59] something was trying to operate your
[2:54:01] life anybody wanna
[2:54:06] as that young boy i'm going to close
[2:54:08] with the finishing of my testimony you
[2:54:09] can play softly if you feel to
[2:54:13] as that young boy pre-adolescent
[2:54:16] begin to experience thoughts and
[2:54:18] feelings and emotions that i'd never
[2:54:20] experienced before i received the
[2:54:22] baptism of the holy ghost at seven years
[2:54:24] old and i walked in the victory
[2:54:27] total victory in my life for several
[2:54:28] years as a child you say i don't believe
[2:54:30] a child like that could receive the holy
[2:54:32] ghost at 7 and really understand what it
[2:54:34] is like to live the life of an overcomer
[2:54:36] i did
[2:54:39] and god used me in those days to preach
[2:54:42] and and and souls were saved and lives
[2:54:44] were changed and and the ministry was
[2:54:47] launched
[2:54:50] in just a few years from now we'll
[2:54:52] celebrate 50 years
[2:54:55] of ministry active ministry in the
[2:54:57] kingdom of god
[2:54:59] i've made many failures and many
[2:55:01] mistakes and many messes in 50 years but
[2:55:03] i've had a lot of victories too
[2:55:06] and as i lay there as a as a young boy
[2:55:09] barely a teen i don't think i was i
[2:55:11] don't think i was yet a teenager all
[2:55:13] these things demon spirits would
[2:55:15] manifest in my room and and stand around
[2:55:17] the edges of my bed
[2:55:20] and you can say it wasn't literal or
[2:55:22] wasn't real but they would they would
[2:55:23] literally
[2:55:24] shake the mattress
[2:55:27] and i had already received the baptism
[2:55:29] of the holy ghost and so these things
[2:55:31] began to trouble me and torment me that
[2:55:33] way and i would raise up in the bed and
[2:55:36] rebuke them
[2:55:38] in the name of jesus christ i command
[2:55:41] you to leave my room
[2:55:43] and they would flee
[2:55:46] and i might go days and never have that
[2:55:48] again
[2:55:50] and finally
[2:55:52] as those thoughts would come and all
[2:55:54] these different things would come and i
[2:55:55] had nobody to talk to and nobody to ask
[2:55:57] about them
[2:55:59] i would spend most of the night still in
[2:56:01] school
[2:56:03] but i would spend most of the night at
[2:56:04] the foot of my bed on my face
[2:56:06] begging god for deliverance
[2:56:09] and not fully understanding what i
[2:56:11] needed to be delivered from
[2:56:13] and one night the spirit of god walked
[2:56:15] me through my my past
[2:56:19] my
[2:56:20] parents and grandparents
[2:56:23] he walked me through it and he showed me
[2:56:27] the spirit of lust
[2:56:28] that was on my father
[2:56:30] that destroyed his marriage
[2:56:34] he showed me the spirit of lust that was
[2:56:36] on his father
[2:56:39] that almost destroyed his marriage
[2:56:42] i later found the letter
[2:56:44] that my mother wrote her father-in-law
[2:56:48] i didn't know this happened
[2:56:50] but i later found the letter years later
[2:56:53] in fact
[2:56:55] last year or year before i found it read
[2:56:57] it again but i read it years ago
[2:56:59] a letter that my mother wrote to her
[2:57:01] father-in-law who had left my
[2:57:03] grandmother
[2:57:05] and was living with a woman in the
[2:57:06] valley
[2:57:07] and she said mr ralph i don't care what
[2:57:09] you're doing
[2:57:11] and i love you just the same
[2:57:13] but you are going to miss
[2:57:15] the most important thing
[2:57:17] in your life the birth of your first
[2:57:20] grandchild if you don't come home
[2:57:23] and she said i plead with you to leave
[2:57:25] that woman in the valley and come home
[2:57:27] to your family
[2:57:29] and he did
[2:57:31] i remember i have memories of a boy
[2:57:34] being let
[2:57:35] loaded up in the back seat of an
[2:57:37] automobile and my mother driving all
[2:57:39] over columbus looking for my dad
[2:57:42] and i was they were divorced when i was
[2:57:44] five so it had to happen before i was
[2:57:46] five
[2:57:48] and she would find him somewhere with
[2:57:49] another woman
[2:57:52] but as god was leading me that night he
[2:57:54] took me from my dad to my grandad to my
[2:57:56] great-grandad
[2:57:58] and showed me the spirit that had
[2:58:00] tormented mr harvey
[2:58:04] my great-grandfather
[2:58:06] that it cost him his happiness in life
[2:58:10] and it cost him to be unfaithful
[2:58:13] to his wife
[2:58:15] i wasn't even a teenager
[2:58:18] i certainly wasn't sexually active in
[2:58:20] any way
[2:58:22] but the
[2:58:23] tormenting spirits of hell had already
[2:58:27] come to claim me
[2:58:31] i don't know how many generations it
[2:58:33] went back
[2:58:34] i god didn't walk me through any more
[2:58:36] than that
[2:58:38] i don't know how many it might have gone
[2:58:40] 100 generations
[2:58:42] i have no way of knowing how far that
[2:58:44] spirit went back but all i know is
[2:58:47] laying at the foot of my bed night after
[2:58:49] night after night on my face begging god
[2:58:52] to deliver me from what i didn't even
[2:58:54] understand
[2:58:56] he met me
[2:58:58] there he saw my limited knowledge
[2:59:02] and limited understanding he knew i
[2:59:04] didn't know how to discern what was
[2:59:06] going on and he spoke to my heart and he
[2:59:08] said i'm going to deliver you of a
[2:59:10] spirit of lust that has visited your
[2:59:13] family for generations
[2:59:16] now as a 11 12 year old boy at the foot
[2:59:18] of my bed i had no concept
[2:59:22] of children of my own
[2:59:25] i had no thoughts of having
[2:59:27] grandchildren of my own all i knew was
[2:59:30] that god had come to expose
[2:59:33] and to deliver
[2:59:35] and he gave me the grace to discern the
[2:59:38] spirit that was out to destroy my life
[2:59:41] although it had never identified itself
[2:59:43] because i had not even really reached
[2:59:46] that stage in life
[2:59:47] to be thinking of those things
[2:59:52] even though my mother was not a
[2:59:53] christian
[2:59:54] she raised me as close as she possibly
[2:59:57] could in a pure environment i had never
[2:59:59] seen a a picture of pornography or i had
[3:00:02] never come in contact not even as a kid
[3:00:04] with with little neighborhood friends or
[3:00:07] things like that that you know happened
[3:00:08] so readily around around life
[3:00:11] none of those things had happened
[3:00:14] so i fully did not understand what the
[3:00:16] enemy was trying to do but he came
[3:00:18] because he wanted to destroy my life
[3:00:21] and he wanted that spirit to continue to
[3:00:23] not only torment me and my generation
[3:00:26] but he already had picked out that that
[3:00:28] thing would touch my children and their
[3:00:30] children anybody with me
[3:00:36] it's vitally important
[3:00:39] that we have the gift operating in our
[3:00:41] individual lives
[3:00:43] to be able to discern spirits that come
[3:00:45] to torment us
[3:00:47] and you talk about making somebody mad
[3:00:49] touch their children
[3:00:52] get the concept that the enemy would
[3:00:53] have liked to have put that thing on my
[3:00:55] children and their children it'll make
[3:00:57] you swinging mad
[3:01:00] it'll cause you to beg god don't ever
[3:01:02] let me have a day that i don't have the
[3:01:04] ability to discern the kind of spirits
[3:01:05] that are operating
[3:01:07] now i'm not an expert
[3:01:13] i'm not an expert in these things
[3:01:17] and i'm not boasting
[3:01:20] but i don't know anybody else in this
[3:01:22] room
[3:01:23] that's had more experience with it than
[3:01:25] i have
[3:01:28] you're saying that
[3:01:30] i can give you hundreds and thousands of
[3:01:32] examples if i had the memory to go back
[3:01:33] through the years of praying and casting
[3:01:35] out demon spirits you've heard some of
[3:01:37] the testimonies
[3:01:39] so for me to go to someone and identify
[3:01:41] that a spirit is operating in their life
[3:01:43] and for them to look at me and tell me
[3:01:45] that there is no spirit operating in
[3:01:46] their life at all that this is just a
[3:01:49] personality conflict
[3:01:51] is about the dumbest thing i've ever
[3:01:53] heard of
[3:01:56] you can say amen on me or look at me
[3:01:58] like i'm crazy
[3:01:59] so should i ever come to you
[3:02:02] and tell you there's something going on
[3:02:05] that you need to find out what it is and
[3:02:07] get it all right with god
[3:02:10] i advise you humbly maybe you don't
[3:02:12] think this sounds very humble
[3:02:14] i'm talking to my own church people
[3:02:16] i'm not talking to you visitors
[3:02:19] if i come to you that way you ought to
[3:02:21] know that i have taken some time
[3:02:24] to consider the seriousness of my words
[3:02:27] if you're not able to discern you ask
[3:02:29] the lord and he will open your eyes
[3:02:33] if you're able to recognize how a spirit
[3:02:35] is trying to cause confusion in your
[3:02:37] family or in your church or around you
[3:02:39] and you are able to recognize that god
[3:02:42] is letting you see that because he wants
[3:02:44] you to pray
[3:02:46] and he wants you to take a stand for
[3:02:48] what is right
[3:02:50] the one thing i know about spirits is
[3:02:52] they're contagious
[3:02:55] they're transferable
[3:02:57] what brother
[3:02:59] andrews preached to us so many years ago
[3:03:01] now i'm not saying anymore and i didn't
[3:03:03] say this to strike fear in you i want
[3:03:06] you to know you got power over anything
[3:03:08] the enemy would throw in your life but
[3:03:10] there are people that stand there are
[3:03:11] people in this room right now that if
[3:03:13] god would open your eyes and let you
[3:03:16] recognize what the enemy is trying to do
[3:03:19] you could come to calvary
[3:03:23] you could come to calvary and the
[3:03:25] authority of the blood
[3:03:31] i believe that we're in an hour now
[3:03:34] where many times somebody's deliverance
[3:03:37] is not in the hands of the preacher
[3:03:40] it's in their own hands
[3:03:43] i want you to know you're not an
[3:03:45] underling in the kingdom of god
[3:03:48] you're not some little peon in god's
[3:03:50] economy
[3:03:52] if he loved you enough to call you and
[3:03:54] to save you and to fill you with his
[3:03:57] spirit he's already loved you enough to
[3:04:00] give you an authority to deal with
[3:04:03] whatever it is the enemy would use to
[3:04:05] bind you down to confuse you god is not
[3:04:09] the author of confusion
[3:04:12] i want to see people free
[3:04:15] and i'm not dumb enough to think that
[3:04:16] they've got to have me to be free
[3:04:19] you don't have to have me to be free
[3:04:21] i can be god's gift to you if you let me
[3:04:23] be brother greeley can be god's gift to
[3:04:26] you if you'll let him be but i want you
[3:04:28] to know you can have deliverance in your
[3:04:29] own mouth
[3:04:31] somebody could sit right back there
[3:04:33] today and speak their own freedom
[3:04:37] oh i don't think we've got time to
[3:04:40] attach ourselves to a man not in this
[3:04:42] hour
[3:04:45] we've got to attach ourselves to jesus
[3:04:47] christ
[3:04:49] and know that he can deliver whatever it
[3:04:51] is the enemy uses
[3:04:53] to tie you up
[3:04:58] and he's raising up a warlock spirit
[3:05:01] in people's hearts
[3:05:03] you start watching the enemy touch your
[3:05:05] family and i want you to know you'll get
[3:05:07] that we talked yesterday at the funeral
[3:05:09] about sister anita operating in a mama
[3:05:11] bear anointing
[3:05:14] she's not the only one that has to have
[3:05:17] a mama bear anointing sometime when you
[3:05:19] recognize that the enemy's trying to
[3:05:21] touch something that belongs to you
[3:05:23] and you start taking
[3:05:27] thank you jesus
[3:05:29] you start taking authority over that
[3:05:32] my god i feel something so generational
[3:05:34] happening right now in in my spirit i
[3:05:37] just believe that the lord wants to free
[3:05:39] somebody here today
[3:05:42] and you go out of here lighter than you
[3:05:44] came in let's worship the only way i
[3:05:46] know to create an atmosphere of
[3:05:48] deliverance is to worship
[3:05:50] if you have to slip out and you're free
[3:05:52] of these things god bless you as you
[3:05:54] leave us
[3:05:55] but if you're like me and you need some
[3:05:57] help in these areas why don't you
[3:05:58] worship with us let's see what the lord
[3:06:01] will do it doesn't have to be long and
[3:06:02] drawn out he might meet you in the first
[3:06:04] song
[3:06:06] he might meet you in your first effort
[3:06:07] to concentrate on him i'll do some more
[3:06:10] teaching on discerning of spirits
[3:06:11] tuesday night for those of you that will
[3:06:13] be here we'll probably finally get to
[3:06:15] the subject

[3:14:02] the lord is calling someone this morning
[3:14:06] the lord is calling to you
[3:14:10] to take a stand
[3:14:12] [Music]
[3:14:16] i believe if you will
[3:14:17] humble yourself before the lord and i
[3:14:19] know you you've come to worship
[3:14:22] [Music]
[3:14:25] god will give you strength to stand
[3:14:31] you found yourself
[3:14:33] being a little too wishy-washy
[3:14:36] not trying to say that to be offensive
[3:14:38] i found those seasons in my life
[3:14:42] where you just don't want to rock the
[3:14:43] boat
[3:14:46] but you get a little too compromised
[3:14:51] you start swallowing things that you are
[3:14:53] not supposed to swallow
[3:14:55] tolerate things that you're not supposed
[3:14:57] to tolerate
[3:14:58] in other people's lives and then in your
[3:15:00] own life
[3:15:01] and you want the lord i know i know
[3:15:04] that if you recognize that you're like
[3:15:06] me you want the lord to give you
[3:15:07] strength to stand
[3:15:09] [Music]
[3:15:13] i've been talking to some folks recently
[3:15:16] who've been telling me god is dealing
[3:15:17] with me about what to get rid of and
[3:15:19] what to throw out of my house and what's
[3:15:21] been stealing my time
[3:15:24] and i started to say earlier everything
[3:15:26] doesn't have a spirit every rock don't
[3:15:28] have a demon under it
[3:15:29] you cannot become paranoid in this hour
[3:15:33] but if god highlights something
[3:15:35] if the holy ghost brings discernment to
[3:15:37] you about something you've got to obey
[3:15:40] him you can't play with god
[3:15:44] you can play with the preacher's opinion
[3:15:46] but you can't play with god and i just
[3:15:48] feel like the lord is calling to someone
[3:15:50] today he wants to give you strength to
[3:15:52] stand for him
[3:15:53] and he wants to strengthen your feet
[3:15:55] your give your hind's feet
[3:15:58] to stand on the word and watch what
[3:16:00] happens when you do
[3:16:03] so we just pray right now if you're here
[3:16:06] and you'd say i need some of that just
[3:16:07] hold up your hand i need some of that
[3:16:09] strength
[3:16:10] now lord i'm standing here with a group
[3:16:13] of people
[3:16:14] who need you
[3:16:16] and we confess today
[3:16:19] that we need your strength to stand in
[3:16:22] this evil hour
[3:16:24] your word told us that this day was
[3:16:26] coming and this generation would come
[3:16:29] and the end time would be upon us
[3:16:32] your word told us what it would look
[3:16:34] like before the coming of the lord
[3:16:37] and we're in that season
[3:16:40] where we see the scripture fulfilling
[3:16:42] and lord we need your strength to stand
[3:16:45] in this hour against the wiles
[3:16:47] of the enemy
[3:16:49] and the spirits that harass and attack
[3:16:51] the saints of the most high god i'm
[3:16:53] asking you right now to honor every hand
[3:16:56] that went up in this room and let the
[3:16:58] holy ghost impart strength from the top
[3:17:01] of their head to the soles of their feet
[3:17:03] to make better choices for their lives
[3:17:06] and better choices for their family to
[3:17:08] make a better stand on what your word
[3:17:11] has made clear lord strengthen your
[3:17:14] children right now

[3:17:25] currency
[3:17:27] there has ever been
[3:17:29] the precious blood of jesus christ
[3:17:32] you are valuable to him so valuable that
[3:17:35] he paid such an expensive price
[3:17:38] for you to belong to him
[3:17:40] now i want you to let him make you the
[3:17:42] reward for his suffering
[3:17:44] i want every one of us to let god make
[3:17:47] us the reward
[3:17:49] for how the lamb has suffered on our
[3:17:50] behalf may the glory of god and the
[3:17:53] character of jesus christ be formed in
[3:17:56] every one of those who call his name and
[3:17:58] love him in this house may the holy
[3:18:00] ghost come and strengthen each one to
[3:18:03] stand in this hour with a testimony
