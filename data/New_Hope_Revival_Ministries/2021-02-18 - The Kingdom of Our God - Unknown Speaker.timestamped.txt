[0:00] there is a kingdom that's above it all
[0:04] it's the kingdom of our god it's a
[0:06] powerful kingdom
[0:14] we're dual citizens in the sense that we
[0:17] were
[0:18] foreknown in another world and our real
[0:21] citizenship
[0:22] is in that other dimension but we were
[0:24] sent here
[0:26] and so as born again believers our
[0:29] spirit man
[0:30] must always stay in touch with the
[0:33] homeland
[0:34] you are a tripartite man and two parts
[0:38] of you
[0:39] should be must be connected
[0:42] to the real genuine spirit of god
[0:45] or let's say to the kingdom of god the
[0:48] other part of you
[0:49] will function in this kingdom
[0:53] but we must make sure that we keep the
[0:56] spirit man the soul life
[0:59] both two parts under submission
[1:03] to the will of god to the mind of god to
[1:07] the leading of the holy ghost
[1:09] because if we are more connected to the
[1:11] kingdom of men the kingdom of the earth
[1:13] than we are to the kingdom of god we
[1:16] will get in
[1:17] so much trouble along the way
[1:21] this world's messed up i just want you
[1:25] to know she's messed up
[1:27] she's not trying the kingdoms of men
[1:31] are not trying they're lying they're not
[1:34] trying to make us one
[1:38] they're trying to make us idiots
[1:40] [Music]
[1:42] they're not trying to make us one
[1:44] they're not trying to bring us in union
[1:46] in unity with one another they're not
[1:48] after unity
[1:50] they're after division they cry
[1:53] unity and then they divide us
[1:56] [Music]
[1:58] into more than two genders
[2:01] into a various flavor of shades and
[2:05] colors and
[2:06] i don't know what else let me tell you
[2:08] something
[2:09] we just have to kind of ignore the
[2:12] kingdom of men
[2:14] we're not a caucasian or white or
[2:18] non-hispanic
[2:20] i've been born again i've been born
[2:23] again
[2:24] hallelujah and i am of another race
[2:30] i am of a super race hallelujah
[2:34] and you can be you can be native
[2:37] american and
[2:38] asian and hispanic and all
[2:41] shades of brown or black and
[2:44] still be a part of this race because
[2:47] this
[2:48] race is not about the kingdom of man
[2:51] it's about the kingdom of god you can't
[2:55] sign up for this you have to be born
[2:58] into this
[3:00] it's got to be our main citizenship
[3:04] our biggest identity is not as an
[3:08] american or as a caucasian
[3:11] or a non-caucasian our biggest identity
[3:14] is found
[3:15] in jesus christ and we have to start
[3:19] thinking like that
[3:20] and you cannot look in a pool of blood
[3:22] on the floor of an operating room
[3:25] or in a public place where there's been
[3:28] a shooting
[3:29] you can't look at that pool of blood and
[3:31] now if a black man
[3:32] bled that blood or a white man bled that
[3:35] blood it's all the same
[3:37] i know people are not treated the same i
[3:39] don't deny the fact
[3:41] that people are not treated the same and
[3:43] it's because
[3:44] people are focusing on a kingdom that's
[3:47] about to shake
[3:48] like it has never shook before
[3:51] the kingdom of man it's going to have to
[3:55] give away
[3:56] and eventually the kingdoms of the earth
[3:58] are going to have to give away
[3:59] and even the kingdoms of heaven are
[4:01] going to have to give away
[4:05] because there is a kingdom that's above
[4:08] it all
[4:09] it's the kingdom of our god it's a
[4:12] powerful kingdom
[4:13] it operates with its own justice system
[4:17] it operates with his own rules and
[4:19] regulations and restrictions
[4:20] and instructions and it is almost always
[4:24] counter culture not cancel
[4:28] culture counterculture it's almost
[4:31] always flowing against the popular
[4:34] culture
[4:36] of the day
