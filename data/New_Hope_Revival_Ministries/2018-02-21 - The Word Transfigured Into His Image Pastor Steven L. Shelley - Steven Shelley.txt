TRANSCRIPT
========================================
for about six months now I've had a portion of Scripture on my heart I just don't seem to be able to get it off my mind I brought it to the congregation here in Alabama and I even traveled with it but I want to share it with you today it's a scripture where Jesus is speaking about the word about what we hear and what we do with what we hear I know that all of us have heard amazing sermons preached from God's Word many with power and with demonstration but I think it's very very important that we are not just hearers but we are also do and I also believe that there are new levels of revelation and glory that God wants to give us personally as individuals as we engage the word that we hear as we go back and revisit and we pray we ask the Lord father I want you by the Holy Spirit to open these passages of Scripture up to my life and I want to understand with revelation how to apply them how I should react how I should respond to your word I believe the Bible is a written record of God's Word I believe that Jesus Christ is the Living Word of God I believe he lives in us by the power of the Holy Ghost and I believe that it is his desire to unveil his word to you and I personally we know that Scripture is going to line up with Scripture and we know that anything God speaks to us in this day in this hour it must fit the scripture perfectly but when I'm talking about receiving a personal revelation from the word I'm talking about that quickening life that comes from the inside when God unveils our opens up a scripture to us personally shows us how to use it how to apply it in our life the scripture is Mark chapter 4 verses 23 and 24 I want to read it from the amplified version of the Bible it says if any man has ears to hear let him be listening and let him perceive and comprehend and he said to them be careful what you are hearing the measure of thought and study you give to the truth you hear will be the measure of virtue and knowledge that comes back to you and more besides will be given to you who hear I'm thinking about all of the hours in my life that I have spent reading God's Word or hearing God's Word and I'm thinking about all of those missed opportunities that I've had along the way to let that word become real to me personally and individually I guess we've got a lot of making up to do here in the end time but I think there's never been a more important moment in our lives than now I believe it is right now that God wants to make his word a living reality to you and I as individuals this Living Word you see I believe that we need like never before a revelation of who our God is and then we need a revelation of of who we are in God once we receive and understand who God is and who we are in him then we can get a revelation of who he is in us if he's living in us if this is the life of Jesus Christ living in me then it will produce his character his attributes if I am truly bone of his bone flesh of his flesh and spirit of his spirit then through my life Jesus desires to live to finish his endtime plan I'm not just talking about reading the word or hearing the word but I'm talking about reacting to what we hear Jesus said you're the measure of thought and study do you go back and ponder meditate sometimes we use the word ruminate because of the sheep we study we pray we ask the Lord to quicken his word and make it real to us and then we not only have a reaction but we have a response and our response has to be to mix the Word of God with our faith because that's what activates it in your life it may sound a little bit crude but I grew up in a church where they often spoke about digesting the Word of God and I think it's although maybe a little bit crude for you to think about chewing on the Word of God it's not so far away from what Jesus was sharing with his disciples when he told them to eat his body and drink his blood his word and his life when we hear the word of God read the Word of God and we begin to chew on that word we began to ask God to make it alive in our lives I believe that he has promised to give us glory upon glory there's another verse of scripture that comes to my heart in 2nd Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 17 that sort of summarizes what I'm trying to say now the Lord is the spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty the amplified says emancipation from bondage freedom do you believe that do you believe that where the Spirit of the Lord is there is emancipation from all bondage freedom I do and then it says in verse 18 and all of us as with unveiled face because we continued to behold in the Word of God as in a mirror the glory of the Lord are constantly being transfigured into his very own image I can't tell you how that excites me on the inside of the inside of Who I am because the Apostle is telling us if we continue in the word of God even the very words that Jesus spoke if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed and here the Apostle is saying if we continue to behold in the Word of God as in a mirror the glory of the Lord what are you seeing when you look into God's Word I hear people say sometimes it's III read murder and conflict and and woes and judgments and so forth well I want you to know there there's a lot of reality in God's Word there's some truth to some of those things that people say but I want you to know that we have a choice as a part of the overcoming bride of Jesus Christ when we look at the Word of God I choose today to see the glory of God I choose to see today the sovereignty of God and that God is going to take care of his bride in these last days I see the Spirit of God when I look in the word I see the Spirit of God and the glory of God desiring to fall on a people not in visitation but in habitation that we might be a pure reflection of Jesus Christ in the very closing hours of Earth's history I better finish reading this portion it says with unveiled face because we continued to behold in the Word of God as in a mirror the glory of the Lord we're constantly being transfigured into his very own image that's my desire in ever-increasing splendor and from one degree of glory to another for this comes from the Lord who is the spirit let me just mention this increasing splendor and from one degree of glory to another King James says from glory to glory I like that but I like the way it's expressed here from one degree of glory to another maybe you're one of those who believes that we have all that we're going to have and we're just waiting on the Lord to come I want you to know there's a whole lot more going on in this world right now you see because God has chosen a bride before the foundation of the world and by the Living Word of God in us we are being transfigured transformed into his very image I want you to know that I'm not just praying for that transformation in my life but I'm praying for that transformation in the life of the bride of Jesus Christ in every nation of the world keep pressing in keep reading and studying God's Word and make sure that your reaction and your response is the right one and I know that we're going to make it by the grace of God bye bye for now you
