[46:57] you know with the with the worship some
[46:59] of them I'm familiar with some of them
[47:01] I'm just learning but you know when
[47:04] those shackles fell off the apostles
[47:08] hands they and and they did and they
[47:11] were they were free but before that
[47:14] happened they were free in here they
[47:16] were free
[47:21] indeed there's never been men more free
[47:24] within their spirit than the apostles
[47:26] amen there was never anyone more free
[47:29] than John the Revelator who was
[47:31] imprisoned on the aisle of patmas for
[47:33] the word of God and for the testimony of
[47:36] Jesus but in his heart you don't get
[47:38] Visions like that unless you're a free
[47:40] man in Jesus name so I thank the Lord
[47:43] for His blessings this day I'm thankful
[47:45] for each and everyone and I'm looking

[1:01:37] all what a blessing thank
[1:01:41] you we don't even entertain the
[1:01:43] criticism
[1:01:45] anymore you know in the 90s they
[1:01:47] criticized us for having
[1:01:50] drums now a lot of them have
[1:01:53] drums
[1:01:57] so just don't get on the what's popular
[1:01:59] just let the Lord lead you in your
[1:02:02] worship I want a church I made my dear
[1:02:05] old grandma a promise I want a church
[1:02:08] where people are free to Worship the
[1:02:10] Lord according to the dictates of their
[1:02:13] heart if that is offensive to you you're
[1:02:16] going to be very
[1:02:18] offended because we intend to let people
[1:02:21] have freedom to worship God We Believe
[1:02:24] in the order but not man's
[1:02:26] order we believe in the Holy Spirit
[1:02:29] order somebody might wave a flag
[1:02:32] somebody might dance somebody might run
[1:02:35] somebody might wear a prayer Shaw
[1:02:37] somebody might wave an Israeli FL I
[1:02:39] don't know I don't know what God's going
[1:02:41] to show you to do or lead you to do or
[1:02:42] direct you to do but I want you to be
[1:02:45] free in this
[1:02:46] house it's paid for after all
[1:02:52] now you might as well enjoy
[1:02:55] it someone asked the qu couple of people
[1:02:58] actually asked a question this week does
[1:03:00] that include the debt of the church does
[1:03:02] that include everything it does all 60
[1:03:05] Acres all the all the buildings mobile
[1:03:08] homes and different things that belong
[1:03:10] to the church uh office building all of
[1:03:13] it it's
[1:03:15] all free and
[1:03:17] clear thanks be to God it's been a long
[1:03:21] journey he's faithful you believe that I
[1:03:26] I want us to read this morning I would
[1:03:28] tell you to turn but I'm going to be
[1:03:30] reading it from the Amplified Bible and
[1:03:33] I don't know how many of you have an
[1:03:35] amplified Bible with you this morning
[1:03:37] but you can certainly read along in King
[1:03:39] James I love the King James it's my
[1:03:42] preference it's where I go first in all
[1:03:46] situations but I like the Amplified
[1:03:49] Bible pretty good uh again we faced a
[1:03:52] lot of criticism the first time we dared
[1:03:54] use it and now I hear Brothers using it
[1:03:57] all over I hear a lot of ministers using
[1:03:59] it and uh so don't don't uh get hung up
[1:04:02] on anything like that if you don't want
[1:04:05] it or it doesn't help you it doesn't
[1:04:06] amplify things for you then don't don't
[1:04:09] use it but this morning I've chosen to
[1:04:11] use it a few places and I I hope you'll
[1:04:14] be blessed by it I want us to read Psalm
[1:04:17] 83 because it's clear to me that that's
[1:04:21] where we
[1:04:22] are I'm going going to be speaking this
[1:04:25] morning on 12 reasons why Believers
[1:04:28] support Israel and the Jewish
[1:04:31] people it's a little different but it's
[1:04:34] what we need for this hour because
[1:04:36] there's never been such a demonic Spirit
[1:04:38] of anti-Semitism like there is in the
[1:04:41] world today it's greater than the day of
[1:04:43] Hitler it's everywhere it's now among
[1:04:46] Christian people and if you're on social
[1:04:48] media you will find out that there are
[1:04:50] those who claim the message of the hour
[1:04:52] who are very very anti-israel anti- the
[1:04:56] Jewish people and and I don't know what
[1:04:58] prophet they're following because this
[1:05:01] book is just one little quote book that
[1:05:03] brother Dale catch put together of of
[1:05:06] reference after reference and paragraph
[1:05:08] after paragraph where brother brandham
[1:05:10] tells us that this nation of Israel is

[1:14:10] said
[1:14:12] amen number one I don't usually preach
[1:14:15] like this or teach like this 12 reasons
[1:14:18] to support Israel and the Jewish people
[1:14:21] many Church fathers have taught that God
[1:14:25] was finished with the Jews and left them
[1:14:27] in Exile as a sign of their Divine
[1:14:31] rejection however this all changed
[1:14:34] dramatically with Israel's restoration
[1:14:36] as a nation back in its ancestrial home
[1:14:41] we're going to look today at 12 biblical
[1:14:43] reasons why Believers and in fact all
[1:14:46] Christians should support bless and
[1:14:49] stand with the Jewish nation of Israel
[1:14:53] read reason number one Israel is the
[1:14:56] only nation on earth created by a
[1:15:00] sovereign Act of God I want you to say
[1:15:03] both times both not only her birth but
[1:15:07] her
[1:15:08] rebirth Sovereign Act of God the certain
[1:15:13] this certainly includes the modern
[1:15:15] Rebirth of the Jewish State Israel
[1:15:17] belongs to God himself as creator of
[1:15:20] Heaven and Earth God has the right of
[1:15:23] ownership to the universe and therefore
[1:15:26] he can give his land to whomever he
[1:15:29] chooses God is given the title deed of
[1:15:32] the land of Israel to Abraham Isaac
[1:15:36] Jacob and their descendants forever
[1:15:39] Genesis
[1:15:40] 177 and 8 in the Amplified Bible get
[1:15:44] ready to read it
[1:15:47] Ellas and I will establish my covenants
[1:15:51] between me and you and your descendants
[1:15:54] after you throughout their generation
[1:15:56] for an everlasting for an
[1:15:59] everlasting solm pledge read on to be a
[1:16:05] God to you and to your posterity after
[1:16:08] you that's
[1:16:10] correct and I will give to you and to
[1:16:13] your posterity after you the land in
[1:16:15] which you are a stranger going from
[1:16:18] place to place all the land of Canaan
[1:16:20] for an everlasting possession and I will
[1:16:23] be their God do you believe the word for
[1:16:26] 3500 years the land of Israel has
[1:16:29] belonged to Abraham Isaac and Jacob and
[1:16:32] their seed Forever by an everlasting and
[1:16:35] eternal blood Covenant recorded in the
[1:16:37] Bible the land that God promised to
[1:16:40] Israel includes the modern-day nation of
[1:16:43] Israel parts of Moder day Egypt Syria
[1:16:47] Lebanon and
[1:16:49] Iraq we're not just contending for the
[1:16:51] nation for the land land of Israel we're
[1:16:55] we're claiming the ancestrial land of
[1:16:57] Abraham Isaac and Jacob the Bible
[1:17:00] clearly records that Abraham plead with
[1:17:02] God to allow Ishmael to own the land and
[1:17:06] to inherit the future promises fulfill
[1:17:08] God sent back a one-word
[1:17:12] text no he said no Abraham W with with a
[1:17:16] loving fatherly spirit will you consider
[1:17:21] Ishmael is there any Poss
[1:17:23] possibility that you would allow him to
[1:17:26] be the promised seed and the promised
[1:17:28] son and God just simply says no I won't
[1:17:32] do that and how many of you know God is
[1:17:34] Sovereign he shows Mercy where he
[1:17:36] desires to show Mercy it's what the
[1:17:38] scripture tells us and God said no I
[1:17:41] will not accept Ishmael as the promised
[1:17:43] son Isaiah
[1:17:46] 667 through 10 jot these verses down
[1:17:49] these are good scriptures to hold on to
[1:17:52] in time like this before Zion you ready
[1:17:56] to read
[1:17:57] ellias would you like to just I'll just
[1:17:59] send you my notes afterwards so you
[1:18:01] don't have to write and read at the same
[1:18:03] time I'll send them to you now
[1:18:08] read before Zion travailed she gave
[1:18:12] birth before her pain Came Upon her yes
[1:18:15] she was delivered of a malech child
[1:18:18] yes who has heard of such a thing who
[1:18:21] has heard of such a thing who has seen
[1:18:25] such things shall a land be born in one
[1:18:28] day or shall a nation be brought forth
[1:18:31] in a moment for as soon as Zion was in
[1:18:34] labor she brought forth her children
[1:18:37] Hallelujah read on shall I bring to the
[1:18:40] moment of birth and not cause to bring
[1:18:43] forth says the Lord shall I who cause to
[1:18:46] bring forth shuts the womb says your
[1:18:49] lord your God Rejoice with Jerusalem and
[1:18:53] be glad for her all you who love her
[1:18:56] yeah Rejoice for Joy with her all you
[1:19:00] who mourn over her is that right in the
[1:19:03] message the voice of the sign 1964
[1:19:08] paragraph 38 brother brandom said Israel
[1:19:11] is a
[1:19:12] nation God doesn't deal with Israel as
[1:19:16] an individual Israel is a nation you see
[1:19:21] that means the good the bad and the Ugly
[1:19:24] this is why it doesn't matter that
[1:19:26] everything is not perfect God said I'm
[1:19:28] not dealing with them as individuals I'm
[1:19:31] dealing with them as a nation so those
[1:19:34] who do right and those who do wrong are
[1:19:36] a part of the same nation and God deals
[1:19:39] with them in equal proportion Israel is
[1:19:41] a nation always dealt with them and in
[1:19:44] the last
[1:19:46] days after the going away of the church
[1:19:50] the Rapture then God Will Save Israel as
[1:19:58] a nation is that clear what Israel is he
[1:20:03] talking about the reborn Jewish state of
[1:20:05] Israel what we now know as the modern
[1:20:08] state of Israel it's in the
[1:20:12] Homeland help me now so so don't come
[1:20:16] around and say this is not the Israel of
[1:20:19] the Bible this is the Israel of the
[1:20:22] Bible the Jew
[1:20:23] is in the Homeland ready for it and
[1:20:26] they'll be saved we know why Romans 11
[1:20:31] tells us they were partially blinded for
[1:20:34] the sake of the Gentiles one of the
[1:20:36] Mysteries that brother brandom teaches
[1:20:38] us right out of Scofield's Bible is that
[1:20:41] mystery of the Jewish blindness being
[1:20:44] removed as a nation a whole nation looks
[1:20:48] up and realizes and recognizes what is
[1:20:51] this here he
[1:20:53] stands what is responsible who is
[1:20:57] responsible for these nail prints in
[1:20:59] your hand he said oh
[1:21:02] these I got them in the household of my
[1:21:06] brethren my friends gave me these let me
[1:21:09] tell you something there will be weeping
[1:21:11] and mourning and wailing and that is at
[1:21:14] the second coming it's in the Homeland
[1:21:16] now ready for it and they'll what be
[1:21:19] saved and the Bible said
[1:21:23] Nation b day he just read it Isaiah's
[1:21:26] prophecy a nation born in a day
[1:21:29] literally it happen one day Israel is
[1:21:33] not a nation the Jews have no Homeland
[1:21:36] the next
[1:21:37] [Music]
[1:21:39] day she has an ancestral Homeland
[1:21:42] restored God don't deal with Jews as an
[1:21:46] individual he deals with them as a
[1:21:48] nation Israel always now would would you
[1:21:52] read the rest of
[1:21:55] that it's his
[1:21:58] Nation he didn't call America his
[1:22:03] Nation he called Israel his nation and
[1:22:07] here he is fixing to bring his Nation
[1:22:11] out of a nation in an exodus bring his
[1:22:18] people from a judgment powerful powerful
[1:22:22] because the church is calling for the
[1:22:24] Judgment of the Jewish
[1:22:27] Nation this whole replacement theology
[1:22:31] that is so popular in the modern Church
[1:22:33] world that the church has replaced
[1:22:35] Israel it's a lie there's no reason for
[1:22:39] that you and I have been grafted in
[1:22:42] according to the New Testament we get
[1:22:45] our life out of the
[1:22:46] root amen what root which root The
[1:22:50] Offspring The Root and The Offspring in
[1:22:52] of David that's where it comes from one
[1:22:56] more quotation here as the eagle stirs
[1:22:58] her nest uh paragraph 34 you you seem a
[1:23:01] little aggressive Pastor you I I I am I
[1:23:06] am I feel a little
[1:23:07] aggressive I've been challenged all week
[1:23:11] by Christians who are embracing
[1:23:14] replacement
[1:23:15] theology those who have called the Star
[1:23:18] of David a satanic symbol because they
[1:23:21] spend all of their time on YouTube
[1:23:23] instead of in the
[1:23:27] word let's hear what the prophet said
[1:23:30] let's let YouTube serve its purpose I'm
[1:23:33] preaching on YouTube right now let it
[1:23:35] serve its purpose let us use it for
[1:23:38] Ministry but that's not where we get our
[1:23:41] facts if you're going to believe
[1:23:43] everything you see or hear on YouTube
[1:23:45] may I direct you to all of the things
[1:23:48] that we have against brother brandom
[1:23:49] against the message of the hour and if
[1:23:52] you you look hard enough you'll find
[1:23:53] things against your
[1:23:56] church are you going to believe that we
[1:23:59] must not we must not in in the the
[1:24:03] message uh as the eagle s her nest
[1:24:06] paragraph
[1:24:07] 34 uh they had these packing these Jews
[1:24:11] in Old crippled ones on their backs so
[1:24:15] they went up to interview them and they
[1:24:17] said are you coming back to die in the
[1:24:20] Homeland said no we're coming to see the
[1:24:26] Messiah when they were making their way
[1:24:28] back that gets me when they were W
[1:24:31] making their way back remember the
[1:24:33] threats of the Arab League of Nations
[1:24:35] was already uh blowing threats against
[1:24:38] them and so the world says you're really
[1:24:40] going to come and sit there like sitting
[1:24:43] ducks while they kill you all no we're
[1:24:46] not coming back to the Homeland to die
[1:24:48] we're coming back to see the
[1:24:51] Messiah Hal hallelujah hallelujah he's
[1:24:55] coming he's coming said no we're coming
[1:24:58] to see the Messiah when the Fig Tree
[1:25:00] puts forth its
[1:25:01] branches oh
[1:25:03] brother Israel's becoming a nation
[1:25:13] again you doubt that that's the
[1:25:15] restoration of the state of of of the
[1:25:17] nation of Israel I don't sir he said
[1:25:21] this old six point star of David
[1:25:25] flies the oldest flag in the world no
[1:25:29] mention of a satanic symbol
[1:25:33] here the oldest flag in the world the
[1:25:36] first time it flew for
[1:25:38] 2500 years they're in their own land
[1:25:44] now that's not Pope's
[1:25:46] calendar that's God's
[1:25:49] calendar Hallelujah Messiah will
[1:25:55] come just as sure as they're standing
[1:25:58] there waiting for him we're at the end
[1:26:01] time oh little eaglets press through the
[1:26:05] door of Mercy go flying as hard as you
[1:26:09] can when they brought them up those
[1:26:11] airplanes come down to get those Jews
[1:26:15] they were still plowing with old wooden
[1:26:17] instruments like they did hundreds and
[1:26:19] thousands of years ago still do it in
[1:26:21] South
[1:26:23] Africa so then when we find out that
[1:26:25] they was afraid of that airplane they
[1:26:27] were scared to get in it one old Rabbi
[1:26:30] stepped out there and said don't be
[1:26:33] afraid he said our Prophet promised
[1:26:37] us that someday we'd go to the Homeland
[1:26:40] on the wings of an
[1:26:43] eagle that big TW wa plane raised up
[1:26:47] with them
[1:26:48] Jews that's what the prophet saw am
[1:26:54] Hallelujah he didn't know what it
[1:26:56] was he should have called it an airplane
[1:27:00] he said it's Eagle's Wings they'll come
[1:27:03] back on seen that old airplane raised up
[1:27:05] there 2500 years ago that's what the
[1:27:08] prophet was seeing now it's coming to
[1:27:11] pass right now coming to
[1:27:14] pass right now bringing them back on the

[1:30:47] people who have gone to the land year
[1:30:49] after year after year restoring the V
[1:30:51] Vineyards of Samaria and I want to tell
[1:30:53] you something there's nothing like the
[1:30:55] feeling of cutting grapes in the fields

[1:31:03] Tabernacle in the wilderness sat and
[1:31:06] you're standing there saying I am

[1:31:20] upon the mounts Ephraim shall cry arise

[1:32:43] Israel and
[1:32:45] Ephraim is my first first born I want
[1:32:50] you to know that's power powerful
[1:32:52] prophetic language referring back to to
[1:32:55] verse three yay I have loved thee with
[1:32:58] an everlasting love so one of the
[1:33:00] reasons why we love and pray for Israel
[1:33:03] and the Jewish people is because God
[1:33:04] loves her I have loved thee with an
[1:33:07] Everlasting Love Therefore with loving
[1:33:10] kindness have I drawn
[1:33:12] thee after a season of judgment the
[1:33:15] sword God is motivated by his
[1:33:18] everlasting love to restore Israel yes
[1:33:20] sir no note that it's an everlasting
[1:33:23] love an unceasing love a NeverEnding
[1:33:26] love notice that it is an unconditional
[1:33:29] love just like the love he has for his
[1:33:32] Gentile bride I'm pretty glad about that
[1:33:36] it was this love that birth God's plan
[1:33:38] with Israel and the love this love also
[1:33:41] will bring it to a glorious end now
[1:33:44] there's two long passages here so read
[1:33:47] them excitingly and quickly Deuteronomy
[1:33:49] 7 6-9
[1:33:54] for thou art a holy people unto the Lord
[1:33:58] thy God the Lord thy God hath chosen
[1:34:00] thee to be a special people upon himself
[1:34:03] all right above all people that are upon
[1:34:07] the face of the Earth above them all the
[1:34:10] Lord did not set his love upon you nor
[1:34:13] choose you because you were more in
[1:34:15] number than any people think about it
[1:34:18] for ye were the fewest of all people but
[1:34:22] because the Lord hath loved you because
[1:34:24] the Lord loved you that's why because he
[1:34:29] loved you and because he would keep the
[1:34:32] oath go ahead which he had sworn unto
[1:34:36] your fathers hath the Lord brought you
[1:34:39] out with a mighty hand yes and redeemed
[1:34:42] you out of the house of bondman yes from
[1:34:46] the hand of pharaoh king of Egypt yes
[1:34:49] read on no no there
[1:34:52] therefore know therefore that the Lord
[1:34:55] thy God he is God the faithful God which
[1:34:59] keepeth covenants and mercy with them
[1:35:02] that love him and keep his Commandments
[1:35:04] to a thousand
[1:35:06] Generations I I don't think this is
[1:35:08] about to
[1:35:09] expire I don't think we're near to a
[1:35:12] thousand Generations just yet now read
[1:35:15] Romans 11 because this is very important
[1:35:17] it talks about you and I yes 24 through
[1:35:21] 26 this is
[1:35:23] Amplified for if you have been cut from
[1:35:26] what is by nature a wild Olive Tree and
[1:35:29] against nature grafted into a cultivated
[1:35:31] Olive Tree how much easier will it be to
[1:35:34] graft these natural branches back on the
[1:35:37] original Parent stock of their own Olive
[1:35:41] Tree amen lest you be self up opiniated
[1:35:46] wise in your own conceits I do not want
[1:35:50] I do not not want you to miss this
[1:35:53] hidden truth and mystery
[1:35:57] Brethren a hardening
[1:36:00] insensibility has temporarily be fallen
[1:36:04] apart of Israel to last until the full
[1:36:09] number of the in gathering of the
[1:36:12] Gentiles has come
[1:36:14] in and so
[1:36:20] all
[1:36:23] so all Israel will be saved you somebody
[1:36:27] said what about the Jew that's not
[1:36:29] really a Jew don't you think God knows
[1:36:30] how to sort that out don't try to do
[1:36:33] God's business he doesn't need your help
[1:36:37] there's apostles who claim to be
[1:36:39] apostles who are not
[1:36:41] Apostles right pastors who claim to be
[1:36:44] pastors who are not pastors so it
[1:36:47] shouldn't surprise you that there will
[1:36:49] also be Jews who pretend to be jew Jews
[1:36:51] who are not Jews but God knows without a
[1:36:54] DNA
[1:36:55] [Applause]
[1:37:00] test
[1:37:01] woo somebody said this isn't really a
[1:37:04] shouting message it can be it can be you
[1:37:08] you know why if for no other reason now
[1:37:11] I'm giving you 12 good ones but if for
[1:37:13] no other reason you ought to love this
[1:37:16] because the quicker we get this in our
[1:37:18] Inner
[1:37:20] Man the quicker we can do what our
[1:37:23] responsibility is so this little Gentile
[1:37:26] bride can be raptured
[1:37:28] out amen and then guess what when the
[1:37:31] Brethren when Joseph dismisses the
[1:37:38] Brethren think about the wife think
[1:37:42] about what comes next so all Israel can
[1:37:46] you read it good like
[1:37:48] that and so all Israel will will be
[1:37:51] saved will be saved as it is written the
[1:37:55] deliverer will come from Zion not not
[1:37:58] not not
[1:38:02] America from
[1:38:04] Zion he will banish ungodliness from
[1:38:08] Jacob I'm going to cleanse my
[1:38:10] son God said I'll take care of my son
[1:38:14] I'll get that secularism out of my
[1:38:16] Jewish people I'll settle that you leave
[1:38:20] me to do my work read
[1:38:25] on ain't there another is that the end
[1:38:28] of
[1:38:31] it well I have 27 and 28 after
[1:38:36] it I'll read it I didn't put my number
[1:38:40] there but I've got it and this will be
[1:38:43] my Covenant my agreement with them when
[1:38:46] I shall take away their sins all right
[1:38:49] read on Elias
[1:38:51] from the point of view of the Gospel
[1:38:54] good news they the Jews at present are
[1:38:57] enemies of God that's how it looks right
[1:38:59] now come on they crucified after all
[1:39:02] they crucified the Lord and the church
[1:39:05] wants them to pay I'm telling you the
[1:39:07] Catholic Church wants them to pay and
[1:39:10] the Protestant Church wants them to pay
[1:39:13] but God said I'll take care of them
[1:39:16] don't you worry they're not really my
[1:39:19] enemy I've chosen you I passed by thee
[1:39:22] and saw thee polluted in thy own blood
[1:39:24] and said unto thee
[1:39:27] live when everybody else was prophesying
[1:39:30] your death and your destruction I
[1:39:33] prophesied life to you and the healing
[1:39:36] of your bloody wound this is what the
[1:39:39] scripture tells us read on Elias you're
[1:39:41] doing great which is for your advantage
[1:39:44] and
[1:39:45] benefits but from the point of view of
[1:39:47] God's choice of election that's
[1:39:49] something you all ought to understand
[1:39:51] election yeah of divine selection he he
[1:39:55] said you didn't choose
[1:39:58] me I chose you the reason why you chose
[1:40:02] me is because I chose
[1:40:04] first ain't that what he said to this
[1:40:07] bride he already said it to his
[1:40:10] Nation read they are still the Beloved
[1:40:13] dear to him for the sake of their
[1:40:16] forefathers this is New
[1:40:18] Testament anybody with me yes someone
[1:40:22] once asked how can God love a sinful
[1:40:25] Nation like Israel the answer is simple
[1:40:28] by the same unconditional love the Lord
[1:40:30] has toward his church indeed while we
[1:40:34] were yet sinners what happened Christ
[1:40:37] died for us so here's a simple rule for
[1:40:39] all believers we should love what Jesus
[1:40:44] loves Romans 58 but God shows and
[1:40:49] clearly proves mes his own love for us
[1:40:53] by the fact that while we were still
[1:40:55] sinners Christ the Messiah the anointed
[1:40:59] one died for us reason number three that
[1:41:02] all believers should love and pray for
[1:41:05] Israel and the Jewish people God is a
[1:41:08] covenant keeping God there it is we
[1:41:12] could go
[1:41:13] home but I spent too much time in this
[1:41:16] to go home I'm going to get it out we
[1:41:18] got to read it he's made a Covenant with
[1:41:21] both the people and the land did you
[1:41:24] know the prophets of the Old Testament
[1:41:26] said that God married himself to the
[1:41:32] dirt somebody said why want a two-state
[1:41:36] solution ever successfully work because
[1:41:40] God did not give the land that he
[1:41:44] married to the sons of
[1:41:46] Ishmael he gave the land to Abraham's
[1:41:49] descendants through
[1:41:52] Isaac and he said so that you'll know
[1:41:55] that I'm going to keep my word I am
[1:41:57] marrying myself to the land she is also
[1:42:02] my wife not just the people now I'm
[1:42:05] telling you that's a jealous God over a
[1:42:07] piece of real estate the world mocks and
[1:42:10] they say I don't understand why there's
[1:42:11] so much talk about a little tiny piece
[1:42:14] of real estate well here is what you
[1:42:16] need to be asking why does the enemy
[1:42:18] want that dirt so bad
[1:42:21] because it belongs to God and when God
[1:42:24] ultimately gives it back to his people
[1:42:26] and He
[1:42:29] will he'll show to the nations of the
[1:42:31] earth I am the Covenant keeping God that
[1:42:34] I said I
[1:42:35] was so he affirmed his promise to give
[1:42:38] Israel the land of Canaan with a sworn
[1:42:41] Covenant you remember in Genesis 17 if
[1:42:44] you've ever been to Elon Moray if you've
[1:42:47] ever been up to the top of Elon Moray
[1:42:49] and you have looked out over the nation
[1:42:51] of Israel like God took Abraham and he
[1:42:54] said I want you to look out over that
[1:42:57] and and and and we've been there Nathan
[1:42:59] you you went with us that day too didn't
[1:43:00] you they took us there after we had
[1:43:02] worked in the vineyard and you look out
[1:43:04] over that landscape and you realize that
[1:43:07] once upon a time Abraham stood on that
[1:43:09] mountain and his God said to him you see
[1:43:12] all that I'm going to give it to you and
[1:43:14] to your descendants forever and ever and
[1:43:17] ever I I think Abraham probably danced
[1:43:20] yes I think he probably I don't know if
[1:43:23] he did or not but I know I
[1:43:25] did I had myself a Time upon that
[1:43:28] mountain read for us Genesis 151
[1:43:33] 17-18 when the sun had gone down and a
[1:43:36] thick Darkness had come on Behold a
[1:43:39] smoking oven and a flaming torch passed
[1:43:42] between those
[1:43:44] pieces on the same day the Lord made a
[1:43:47] covenant promise pledge with Abram
[1:43:50] saying to your descendants I have given
[1:43:53] this land from the river of
[1:43:56] Egypt to the great river
[1:44:01] Euphrates neither of which rivers run
[1:44:04] through the modern state of
[1:44:08] Israel so there's some more land to
[1:44:12] come there has to be now this was a
[1:44:15] covenant you you know uh Abraham he
[1:44:18] hears this up on the mountain
[1:44:21] God said I'm going to give you this land
[1:44:23] and The Descendants your descendants are
[1:44:25] going to be as as innumerable as the
[1:44:28] stars of the heaven and Abraham replies
[1:44:31] this is paraphrase but he replies how
[1:44:33] can I be
[1:44:34] sure that you really will do this and
[1:44:37] God answered by coming down like a
[1:44:39] burning torch which passed through the
[1:44:42] sacrificial animals the offering that
[1:44:44] was given to seal the land promised with
[1:44:47] Abraham by a covenant oath and that's
[1:44:50] what Elias just read one of God's main
[1:44:53] character traits is he's a covenant
[1:44:54] keeper if he says it he means it his
[1:44:58] word cannot lie do you believe that
[1:45:01] second Timothy 2:13 in the Amplified
[1:45:03] read it and we're going to try to hurry
[1:45:05] up a little bit we're dragging if we are
[1:45:07] faithless do not believe and untrue to
[1:45:10] him he remains true he remains true if
[1:45:15] Israel has backslidden he remains true
[1:45:19] if you've grown cold in indifferent
[1:45:21] toward God he remains true come on read
[1:45:27] faithful to his word and his righteous
[1:45:29] character for he cannot deny himself he
[1:45:32] cannot deny
[1:45:34] himself in the second seal paragraph
[1:45:38] 23738 and 39 and and 40 he said now I
[1:45:42] just want to ask you something just look
[1:45:44] at something right here in the face
[1:45:46] Israel is now for the first time for
[1:45:49] 2500 years here a nation the oldest flag
[1:45:52] in the world is flying over Jerusalem
[1:45:55] tonight Israel is in her Homeland he
[1:45:59] said there was a brother here one time
[1:46:00] wanted to be a missionary he felt to go
[1:46:03] to be a missionary to the Jews I said
[1:46:06] you might get one now and then oh people
[1:46:10] thinks the whole nation no sir and he's
[1:46:13] talking about in his own day
[1:46:16] 1963 he said Israel is converted as a
[1:46:20] not as a person a nation will be born in
[1:46:23] a day that's Israel all Israel is saved
[1:46:28] just remember that Paul said so all
[1:46:31] Israel is saved now notice all Israel
[1:46:35] that's exactly right now notice but he
[1:46:39] said when you see the Fig Tree and all
[1:46:42] the other trees putting forth their buds
[1:46:44] now watch there's never been a time for
[1:46:48] 2500 years that Israel has ever come to
[1:46:51] her
[1:46:52] Homeland we've got that little show of 3
[1:46:56] Minutes to Midnight you know there she
[1:46:58] is a nation the six-pointed Mand David
[1:47:02] or Star of David flying and all these
[1:47:07] things is there any doubt after hearing
[1:47:10] that that brother brandham believed that
[1:47:12] the modern state of Israel is the
[1:47:15] Fulfillment of the prophet's words no
[1:47:19] doubt no
[1:47:21] out Romans 11:26 read it in the
[1:47:25] Amplified and so all Israel will New
[1:47:28] Testament all Israel will be
[1:47:32] saved read as it is written the
[1:47:35] deliverer will come from Z from Zion he
[1:47:38] will banish ungodliness from Jacob we
[1:47:41] just read that a moment ago now listen
[1:47:44] to this in the six-fold purpose of
[1:47:45] Gabriel's visit until God is finished
[1:47:48] with the Gentiles
[1:47:53] Israel was blinded they went off into
[1:47:55] sin into transgression against God
[1:47:58] because God blinded their eyes that we
[1:48:00] might be grafted in he said you get it
[1:48:04] can't y'all say
[1:48:06] Amen 26th verse now and so all Israel
[1:48:11] shall be saved he said God blinded them
[1:48:14] purposefully for you and I they cannot
[1:48:16] see because God blinded them
[1:48:21] well well when are they going to repent
[1:48:22] they will when are they going to turn to
[1:48:25] they will you can't hate them until they
[1:48:28] come in you've got to love them and
[1:48:30] bless them and pray for them they cannot
[1:48:33] see because God blinded them and all
[1:48:35] Israel true Israel shall be
[1:48:40] saved the Bible defines what a true
[1:48:43] Israelite is a true Jew one who obeys
[1:48:46] the Covenant of God he said what did the
[1:48:49] angel say say
[1:48:51] glory to finish the transgression of
[1:48:54] Israel I've come to tell you that there
[1:48:57] will come a time when Israel's
[1:49:02] transgression God will cut off that wild
[1:49:04] branch and grab into that back that real
[1:49:09] Branch again Hall if you believe that
[1:49:13] say amen amen oh sometimes it makes my
[1:49:16] heart jump come on see them poor
[1:49:19] miserable people cut off out yonder not
[1:49:22] knowing where they're going and think
[1:49:23] that God in his Mercy did
[1:49:27] that you're really going to despise the
[1:49:30] Jewish people when you're the reason
[1:49:35] why this is not to shame us it's to say
[1:49:39] the audacity of the church to say that
[1:49:42] the church has replaced Israel because
[1:49:44] she rejected the Messiah she did exactly
[1:49:47] what God prepared her to do he wouldn't
[1:49:49] allow her to see who he was because he
[1:49:53] also had a covenant with you he was
[1:49:55] bringing you and I in amen he said makes
[1:49:58] my heart jump praise God he did that in
[1:50:01] his mercy so that I could be saved ain't
[1:50:04] that great read would you take over and
[1:50:07] read for me blinded their eyes from
[1:50:10] their own Messiah shut their ears up
[1:50:13] that they could not hear him yet looked
[1:50:16] right at his miracles and looked right
[1:50:18] at his miracles and things that he was
[1:50:21] doing mhm now in the same message
[1:50:24] paragraph 51 so Israel did a wrong to
[1:50:28] God and in this 70th week what's going
[1:50:31] to
[1:50:32] happen I'm not going too deep into this
[1:50:36] we could really divide ourselves this
[1:50:37] morning on that 70th week couldn't we
[1:50:41] God is going to finish the transgression
[1:50:43] of Israel finish the transgressions will
[1:50:45] be turning away from the ungodliness
[1:50:47] from Jacob and then all
[1:50:52] Israel will
[1:50:55] be all of them will
[1:51:01] receive Pentecostal
[1:51:04] Jews
[1:51:06] Hallelujah the real
[1:51:08] kind
[1:51:10] Pentecostal and in the fifth seal
[1:51:13] paragraph
[1:51:14] 257 now if they hadn't been if they
[1:51:18] hadn't been blinded God said let them
[1:51:20] alone they're not worthy but being that
[1:51:22] they was blinded by God his grace
[1:51:25] reached down to them amen talk about
[1:51:27] Amazing Grace and give each one of them
[1:51:30] a
[1:51:31] robe because all Israel will be
[1:51:42] saved I know you think you know the
[1:51:47] number but you might be surprised
[1:51:54] because the ceiling is supposed to take
[1:51:56] place after the second at the second
[1:51:58] coming after the
[1:52:00] Rapture the two witnesses have their
[1:52:03] Ministry with the 144,000 before the
[1:52:06] second
[1:52:07] coming sir so you may not know the
[1:52:10] number like you think you do I may not
[1:52:14] know the number and give each one of
[1:52:16] them a robe because all Israel will be
[1:52:19] saved
[1:52:20] everyone has his name written that's
[1:52:24] right what does that last sentence
[1:52:27] say now this is a very uh important
[1:52:31] scripture that we've got to read very
[1:52:32] carefully Revelation 6: 9-1 11 listen to
[1:52:37] this very
[1:52:38] carefully I shared this with a rabbi who
[1:52:42] was
[1:52:43] amazed he was absolutely
[1:52:48] amazed when the lamb broke open the
[1:52:51] fifth seal I saw at the foot of the
[1:52:54] altar The Souls of those whose lives had
[1:52:58] been sacrificed for adhering to the word
[1:53:01] of God and for the testimony they had
[1:53:04] born now go back in the King James it
[1:53:09] says and for the testimony that they
[1:53:12] had the church
[1:53:15] teaches that this is Martyrs for Christ
[1:53:21] most of the end time prophecy preachers
[1:53:25] believe that this is Christians who have
[1:53:28] been beheaded or martyred for the cause
[1:53:30] of Christ brother brandham caught the
[1:53:32] spirit of this verse it didn't say for
[1:53:36] Christ it said whose lives have been
[1:53:40] sacrificed for adhering to the word of
[1:53:43] God they kept the word and for the
[1:53:46] testimony that they
[1:53:48] had later it says about another group of
[1:53:52] Overcomers they held the testimony of
[1:53:55] Jesus Christ this says and for the
[1:53:59] testimony that they had born next
[1:54:04] verse they cried in a loud voice oh
[1:54:08] Sovereign Sovereign Lord holy and true
[1:54:11] how long I'm not going to let you read
[1:54:14] how
[1:54:16] long how long now before you will sit in
[1:54:21] judgment and avenge our blood upon those
[1:54:24] who dwell on the earth did you know this
[1:54:27] week that that area under that altar is
[1:54:30] getting Fuller and
[1:54:34] Fuller whole families massacred in their
[1:54:38] bed there was a whole family of five
[1:54:40] missing and they found them they thought
[1:54:42] they had been carried away but they
[1:54:44] found them in their bed the father
[1:54:47] laying on top of his grown sons and and
[1:54:49] wife the father laying on top and all of
[1:54:52] them murdered in their own
[1:54:54] beds died as Jews not having the
[1:54:58] testimony of Jesus Christ and the church
[1:55:00] world would have you believe they went
[1:55:02] to
[1:55:05] hell it's what they
[1:55:07] teach they couldn't have gone anywhere
[1:55:10] else because they didn't have the
[1:55:11] testimony of Jesus Christ but God let
[1:55:14] brother brandham see under that seal
[1:55:16] this wasn't Christian Martyrs these were
[1:55:19] Jews that had been killed down Through
[1:55:22] the Ages who were faithful to the word
[1:55:26] that had been given to them and they
[1:55:28] kept their testimony clean before God
[1:55:31] and because of that they hang out under
[1:55:34] the
[1:55:35] Altar and constantly they cry if you
[1:55:39] could hear them I believe Ashley wrote a
[1:55:41] song she wrote a song about it they're
[1:55:45] crying out oh Lord how long how long
[1:55:48] before you avenge our our blood don't
[1:55:50] you come around and tell me that God
[1:55:52] forgot his Covenant with Israel he's
[1:55:55] letting them hang out there under that
[1:55:57] altar until they recognize who he is in
[1:56:01] an appointed hour and they will they
[1:56:04] will they
[1:56:06] will read
[1:56:09] on then they were each given a long and
[1:56:12] flowing and Fest of white robes this is
[1:56:14] what brother Brandon was talking
[1:56:16] about and told to rest rest and wait
[1:56:20] patiently a little while longer a little
[1:56:23] while longer until the number should be
[1:56:26] complete of their fellow servants and
[1:56:28] their Brethren who were to be killed as
[1:56:31] they themselves had been and we don't
[1:56:33] know this number we don't know how many
[1:56:36] will have to give their lives under an
[1:56:38] old
[1:56:39] Covenant as I said this week more and
[1:56:41] more and listen this is just
[1:56:44] starting the death toll will
[1:56:47] rise in in unbelievable Fashions this
[1:56:50] week but God has made a covenant with
[1:56:54] his
[1:56:56] people are you with me number four I got
[1:56:59] to hurry Israel is blessed that's why
[1:57:02] you should pray and love the nation of
[1:57:06] Israel and the Jewish people because
[1:57:08] Israel is blessed Genesis 12:3 and I
[1:57:12] will bless those who bless you and the
[1:57:16] one who curses
[1:57:18] you are you sure you want to spew your
[1:57:21] YouTube
[1:57:25] Venom you need to know you're not going
[1:57:27] to do it
[1:57:30] here not
[1:57:32] here oh no the door that brought you in
[1:57:35] can take you right out are you being
[1:57:38] that yeah I'm being that
[1:57:40] serious I'm being that Ser I will bless
[1:57:43] them that bless thee and curse him that
[1:57:46] curseth thee and in thee Israel
[1:57:50] shall all families of the earth be
[1:57:54] blessed God's purpose is to bless the
[1:57:58] whole world through the nation of Israel
[1:58:01] how many of you know it's happened in
[1:58:02] many many many ways they're ahead of us
[1:58:05] in medical science they're ahead of us
[1:58:07] in technology the first paraplegic that
[1:58:10] ever walked Walked In A contraption that
[1:58:12] I was there the day it was unveiled in
[1:58:15] Tel Aviv the very day that it was
[1:58:17] introduced to the world I happened to
[1:58:19] get to be there because of the
[1:58:20] connections that had taken me to Israel
[1:58:22] on that particular trip and to see a man
[1:58:25] unable to move his head his body I mean
[1:58:28] from his neck down unable to move they
[1:58:30] strap him into a machine and he walks
[1:58:33] across I think I think later my wife saw
[1:58:36] the same machine in Washington when we
[1:58:38] were there with APAC I think you were
[1:58:40] there and saw the same machine that this
[1:58:43] man who had spent his life unable to
[1:58:45] move and now they strap him in of course
[1:58:48] he looks like a robot now now but he's
[1:58:50] moving and he picks up his feet and
[1:58:52] begins to walk across the stage and lift
[1:58:55] up his arms because of the technology
[1:58:58] that God has given to those
[1:59:00] people there are more Nobel prizes among
[1:59:04] those people so be careful how you
[1:59:08] spew do you want a curse on your head do
[1:59:11] you want one on your home do you want
[1:59:13] one on your family it matters what we
[1:59:16] say it matters what we say uh that's
[1:59:20] right Pastor go right ahead and tell
[1:59:23] it are you angry maybe just a
[1:59:27] little maybe just a
[1:59:35] little Israel's
[1:59:38] blessed read this for me I want to read
[1:59:42] Genesis 12:2 and three in the Amplified
[1:59:44] Bible carefully and emphatically read it
[1:59:50] and I will make you of
[1:59:54] you and I will make of you am I'm making
[1:59:56] you nervous yes
[1:59:58] sorry a great nation and I will bless
[2:00:02] you with abundance increase of favors
[2:00:05] all right and make your name famous and
[2:00:07] distinguished he's certainly done that
[2:00:10] he certainly made that little Nation
[2:00:12] famous come on and you will be a
[2:00:16] blessing dispensing good to others now
[2:00:19] this is an important part read this and
[2:00:22] I will bless those who bless you who
[2:00:25] confer Prosperity or happiness upon you
[2:00:29] and curse him who curses or uses
[2:00:31] insolent language toward you all right
[2:00:33] whoa whoa
[2:00:36] whoa insolent language on I looked it up
[2:00:41] and in the Hebrew did you put that did
[2:00:43] you happen to put that it means
[2:00:47] insultingly contemptuous in speech or
[2:00:51] conduct I I'm going to be real honest
[2:00:53] with you I know this is just like raw
[2:00:57] this is raw today but I don't have a lot
[2:01:00] of patience for people who believe that
[2:01:02] the United States planing
[2:01:07] 911 I don't I don't have a lot of
[2:01:09] patience I don't have patience for flat
[2:01:10] earthers either by the
[2:01:14] way and I don't have patience for the
[2:01:16] garbage that they're pedaling out there
[2:01:18] this week that's right that Israel
[2:01:20] created Hamas and that Israel is the one
[2:01:23] who pre-planned this I do not believe
[2:01:27] that even the wickedness of her
[2:01:29] government would allow the
[2:01:33] immorality of planting an attack that
[2:01:35] would burn her own
[2:01:37] babies and by the way I know what
[2:01:39] YouTube says but before it's over you'll
[2:01:42] get to see the pictures if you desire to
[2:01:44] see them they're out there they're out
[2:01:47] there and you'll be able to see them if
[2:01:48] you want to I've seen the burned bodies
[2:01:50] I've seen photographs all week of the
[2:01:52] children's bodies who were burned I've
[2:01:54] not seen the photograph of decapitated
[2:01:56] babies but the world is saying and Al
[2:01:59] jazer who influences a whole lot of what
[2:02:02] we get through social media they're
[2:02:04] reporting that it's all made up and that
[2:02:06] those babies were not decapitated but
[2:02:08] you'll be able to see before it's over
[2:02:10] please don't buy into the conspiracy
[2:02:12] theories of those who hate Israel and
[2:02:14] the Jewish people please don't buy into
[2:02:17] the conspiracy theories of those who
[2:02:19] hate this nation she's wicked America's
[2:02:26] Wicked I'm not taking up for her failure
[2:02:29] she's done Wicked and awful and terrible
[2:02:32] things and yet God still has a people
[2:02:37] here who have also blessed the World by
[2:02:41] sending them the truth of the gospel and
[2:02:44] he remembers his Remnant so though
[2:02:47] there's pollution and corruption and
[2:02:50] though there are Wall Street Jews and
[2:02:52] though there are Rockefeller Jews just
[2:02:54] remember none of that changes the
[2:02:57] Covenant that God made with his people
[2:02:59] so be careful about your insolent
[2:03:01] language insultingly contemptuous and
[2:03:04] speecher conduct
[2:03:09] overbearing you bully
[2:03:11] Spirit showing a rude and arrogant lack
[2:03:15] of
[2:03:16] respect so we want to watch our insolent
[2:03:19] language toward Israel read on and go
[2:03:22] back just a little bit in fact read the
[2:03:24] whole verse again and I will bless those
[2:03:27] and I will bless those who bless you who
[2:03:29] confer Prosperity or happiness upon you
[2:03:32] yes and curse him who curses or uses
[2:03:35] insolent language toward you in you will
[2:03:38] all the families and Kindred of the
[2:03:40] earth be blessed and by you they will
[2:03:43] bless themselves Hallelujah are you with
[2:03:46] me fifth seal paragraph 287 8889 I think
[2:03:51] the one of the things that's holding
[2:03:53] this nation
[2:03:56] together because they've always
[2:03:57] respected the
[2:03:59] Jew that's right given him a place now
[2:04:02] now here is the issue brother Brandon
[2:04:05] boils it down for us you honor the
[2:04:13] Jew and God will honor
[2:04:15] you what about the what about the phony
[2:04:17] Jew God you honor the
[2:04:21] Jew you may not get the opportunity to
[2:04:24] inspect their
[2:04:28] circumcision so if you if you think
[2:04:30] they're Jew you feel like they're Jew
[2:04:31] they present themselves as Jew you honor
[2:04:33] the
[2:04:34] Jew and God will honor you I'll tell you
[2:04:37] I admire anybody that would go and live
[2:04:39] in the land of
[2:04:42] Israel there's turmoil all the time how
[2:04:46] do you know because I've spent enough
[2:04:47] time there myself I've been there when
[2:04:49] they handed out gas masks to American
[2:04:52] citizens because they were afraid of
[2:04:54] what was about to happen I've been there
[2:04:56] when we had to teach our children where
[2:04:57] they would go if a bomb was dropped I've
[2:05:00] been there I understand but I can't
[2:05:02] imagine the full commitment that many of
[2:05:04] our friends have made to leave the
[2:05:06] pleasures of this nation and the
[2:05:08] benefits of this nation to go and live
[2:05:10] in a nation like that but if you honor
[2:05:13] the
[2:05:15] Jew now In fairness I want you to I want
[2:05:17] you to hear the rest of this fifth seal
[2:05:19] now there's a bunch of Jews that's
[2:05:23] Renegades so some Jews are Renegades but
[2:05:26] you honor the Jew and God will honor you
[2:05:31] uh uh uh somebody read uh the rest of
[2:05:33] that for me would you just
[2:05:36] like
[2:05:38] oh there may be a few Renegades
[2:05:42] here but the real
[2:05:45] Jew God has put his name on the book yes
[2:05:49] before the foundation of the world and
[2:05:52] here he was murdered down in this time
[2:05:55] and remember think of it now how perfect
[2:05:57] this is right after them millions of
[2:06:00] slaughtered Jews innocent people by the
[2:06:02] nations of the world here the scripture
[2:06:04] says right in this time that they're
[2:06:06] each one under the
[2:06:09] altar realize what's happened and
[2:06:12] they're
[2:06:15] given what about the Jews that Hitler
[2:06:18] murdered
[2:06:19] there they are fifth seal paragraph 244
[2:06:22] the Jews and Hitler hated them and so
[2:06:25] did ikan so did
[2:06:28] Stalin all of the rest of the world see
[2:06:31] but they stayed true to what they
[2:06:34] believed and they killed
[2:06:40] them you know why these people lost
[2:06:43] their lives in the kabut of of Southern
[2:06:46] Israel they lost their lives because
[2:06:48] because they were
[2:06:49] Jews they were killed because they were
[2:06:52] Jews there's no other reason for their
[2:06:54] killing and if that's the criteria to be
[2:06:56] under the altar in the fifth seal then
[2:06:58] that's exactly where they've been
[2:06:59] carried number five I'm hurrying it
[2:07:02] doesn't feel like it but I'm hurrying
[2:07:04] God Hallows his name in Ezekiel 36 the
[2:07:07] prophet powerfully described how God
[2:07:09] will restore the land and people of
[2:07:11] Israel in the last days when Ezekiel
[2:07:13] sees him returning from the Nations and
[2:07:15] being filled with God's spirit he gives
[2:07:17] a clear reason why God is doing this
[2:07:19] read Ezekiel 36:21 for me help us Lord
[2:07:22] to get this out but I had regard concern
[2:07:26] and compassion for my holy name for my
[2:07:29] name whose name is at
[2:07:33] stake God's name is at stake read on
[2:07:37] which the house of Israel had profaned
[2:07:40] among the Nations to which they went my
[2:07:43] own people were profaning my name to the
[2:07:46] Heathen Nations so he declares in verse
[2:07:49] 23 and 24 read it and I will vindicate
[2:07:53] the Holiness of my great name God is Not
[2:07:57] only jealous for his people he's jealous
[2:07:59] for his name I will vindicate the
[2:08:02] Holiness of my great name and separate
[2:08:05] it for its holy purpose from all that
[2:08:07] defiles it my name which have been
[2:08:09] profaned among the Nations which you
[2:08:11] have profaned among them and the Nations
[2:08:14] will know understand and realize that I
[2:08:17] am the Lord the sovereign ruler who
[2:08:19] calls forth loyalty and obedience
[2:08:21] service when I shall be set apart by you
[2:08:26] and my Holiness Vindicated in you before
[2:08:29] their eyes and yours for I will take you
[2:08:33] from among the Nations and gather you
[2:08:35] out of all countries and bring you into
[2:08:38] your own land
[2:08:45] hello 75 years this year
[2:08:49] 75
[2:08:53] years the Swiss Theologian Carl Barth
[2:08:56] stated in
[2:08:57] 1967 he said now you can read it in the
[2:09:01] newspapers God is fulfilling his
[2:09:04] promises number six Israel is key for
[2:09:09] Revival and blessing for the church read
[2:09:12] Romans 11 12-15 are you giving out okay
[2:09:15] read oh sister Beverly is not giving out
[2:09:20] read now their stumbling their lapse
[2:09:22] their transgression has so enriched The
[2:09:25] World At Large and if Israel's failure
[2:09:28] means such riches for the Gentiles think
[2:09:32] what an enrichment and greater Advantage
[2:09:34] will follow their full reinstatements
[2:09:37] it's to your benefit for the full
[2:09:40] restoration of the House of Israel to
[2:09:41] take place read on but now but now I am
[2:09:45] speaking to you who are Gentiles listen
[2:09:48] in as much then as I am an apostle to
[2:09:51] the Gentiles I lay great stress on my
[2:09:54] Ministry and magnify my
[2:09:57] office in the hope of making my fellow
[2:10:00] Jews jealous in order to stir them up to
[2:10:03] imitate copy and appropriates and thus
[2:10:07] managing to save some of them some of
[2:10:10] them for if their rejection and
[2:10:13] exclusion from the benefits of Salvation
[2:10:15] were overruled for the reconciliation of
[2:10:20] a world to God what will their
[2:10:22] acceptance and admission mean it will be
[2:10:26] nothing short of life from the dead
[2:10:30] Resurrection Resurrection this means
[2:10:33] that Israel's restoration is key for
[2:10:36] everyone who thirsts for the outpouring
[2:10:39] which God still has in store or to put
[2:10:42] it another way if you thirst for any
[2:10:44] Revival particularly bride's Revival
[2:10:47] pray for Israel she's a key that's why
[2:10:51] he keeps telling us over and over again
[2:10:53] she's the time piece she's the time
[2:10:56] piece watch her in uh the revelation of
[2:11:00] Jesus Christ I want to read this we're
[2:11:03] we're moving Zechariah 12th chapter and
[2:11:06] we want to take this real prayerfully
[2:11:08] now I want to get this for the glory of
[2:11:10] God this is the original teaching on the
[2:11:12] church Ages which is called the
[2:11:14] revelation of Jesus Christ series
[2:11:17] Zechariah 12 let's begin the n9th verse
[2:11:19] he's speaking of the coming Zechariah 12
[2:11:22] we begin at 9 9th verse it shall come to
[2:11:24] pass zachari prophesying 487 years
[2:11:29] before the coming of Christ and it shall
[2:11:31] come to pass in that day that I will
[2:11:33] seek to destroy all nations that come
[2:11:35] against Jerusalem and I will pour out
[2:11:37] upon the House of David and upon the
[2:11:39] inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of
[2:11:41] Grace and supplication and they shall
[2:11:44] look upon
[2:11:45] me whom they have pierced this is
[2:11:48] Zachariah prophesying of the second
[2:11:50] coming of Jesus Christ when he hasn't
[2:11:52] even come yet the first time but look at
[2:11:56] paragraph 301 now when is the gospel
[2:12:01] returning to the
[2:12:04] Jews when the day of the Gentile is
[2:12:09] finished the gospel is ready to do what
[2:12:15] to go to the Jews oh I if I just for
[2:12:18] tell you a little something is fixing to
[2:12:19] happen right here see right in this
[2:12:22] day you see it's fixing to happen we get
[2:12:24] it in the church age and this great
[2:12:26] thing is fixing to happen we'll carry
[2:12:28] over to Revelation 11 and pick up those
[2:12:32] two prophets Elijah and the Moses
[2:12:35] returning back again for the Jews who's
[2:12:39] we're ready for it everything is setting
[2:12:41] in order just ready now this is very
[2:12:44] important this Gentile message
[2:12:50] as the Jews brought it to the
[2:12:58] Gentiles one of the reasons why you're
[2:13:00] praying for Israel is because you have a
[2:13:02] responsibility to believe that God will
[2:13:04] help the
[2:13:09] gospel the
[2:13:11] Gentiles will take it right
[2:13:16] back somebody said I thought that was
[2:13:18] after the
[2:13:22] Rapture
[2:13:26] will you want the Rapture to
[2:13:29] come then we've got to get that gospel
[2:13:31] to them somehow and right now all you
[2:13:34] can do is
[2:13:36] pray oh I want to say some
[2:13:41] things you know all those
[2:13:45] criticisms in 2002 when we started
[2:13:48] working in Israel you remember all those
[2:13:51] criticisms remember all the quotes they
[2:13:53] sent us I mean does anybody need the
[2:13:56] same quote a 100
[2:13:58] times God wouldn't let brother brandom
[2:14:01] go God wouldn't let brother brandom go
[2:14:02] God wouldn't let brother brandom go God
[2:14:04] wouldn't let brother brandom go there
[2:14:05] was a reason for that brother brandham
[2:14:08] had a signed gift if he would have gone
[2:14:10] there with that signed
[2:14:13] gift the people would have accepted what
[2:14:16] he was representing get that it wasn't
[2:14:19] time yet that's why I hung out in the
[2:14:21] hanger that's why he was out there
[2:14:23] hearing from the it's not don't you
[2:14:25] go but that doesn't mean that it will
[2:14:28] always be that
[2:14:31] way that sign gift is gone but there is
[2:14:35] a
[2:14:36] bride there is a gentile bride this
[2:14:40] Gentile message as the Jews brought it
[2:14:42] to the Gentiles the Gentiles will take
[2:14:44] it right back to the Jews again and the
[2:14:47] Rapture will come
[2:14:48] you see I'm a little offended by the
[2:14:50] fact I called brother George Smith some
[2:14:52] years ago uh driving through North
[2:14:54] Carolina and I said brother George I'm a
[2:14:56] little I'm a little perplexed by
[2:14:58] something he said what is it I said did
[2:15:00] you know there has never been a single
[2:15:04] sermon translated into
[2:15:09] Hebrew well he just stammers and
[2:15:12] stutters and he said I have no idea and
[2:15:14] he know he know we've had this
[2:15:15] discussion many times he said well I
[2:15:17] have no idea except for the
[2:15:20] fact that the Believers have a tendency
[2:15:23] to believe that we have no part it's a
[2:15:27] separate Covenant and we have no part in
[2:15:31] this and I said and I could also agree
[2:15:34] with that I understand where the logic
[2:15:36] is coming from but what about what
[2:15:38] brother brandom says in the revelation
[2:15:41] of Jesus Christ Series this Gentile
[2:15:43] message as the Jews brought it to the
[2:15:44] Gentiles the Gentiles would take it
[2:15:46] right back to the Jews again and the
[2:15:49] Rapture will
[2:15:50] come and even Dr Vil got it
[2:15:55] right in the church age
[2:15:59] book you heard me
[2:16:02] right he goes on this is a revelation
[2:16:05] story I don't I don't think I have to
[2:16:06] read all that let's go to the
[2:16:08] yellow he copies it right
[2:16:11] over now when is the gospel returning to
[2:16:14] the Jews when the day of the Gentiles is
[2:16:16] finished the gospel is ready to go back
[2:16:18] to the Jews oh if I could just tell you
[2:16:21] something that's about to happen right
[2:16:22] in in in this our day this is a
[2:16:26] quote which I feel very comfortable with
[2:16:29] no Theologian adjusting the
[2:16:33] mindset no Theologian adding an idea of
[2:16:37] what the seventh angel messenger's real
[2:16:39] responsibility was if you add something
[2:16:42] to what brother brandham said about that
[2:16:43] seventh angel messenger you may be on
[2:16:46] Dangerous Ground that's right so I love
[2:16:48] the fact that he just they left this
[2:16:50] here these two prophets Moses and Elijah
[2:16:53] turning the gospel back to the Jews
[2:16:55] we're ready for it everything is in
[2:17:00] order I'm I'm moving on everything is in
[2:17:03] order as the Jews brought the message to
[2:17:08] the
[2:17:11] Gentiles read it Brother gy come on even
[2:17:14] so the Gentiles will take it right back
[2:17:17] to the Jews I thought this was supposed
[2:17:19] to be after
[2:17:23] Rapture is that
[2:17:26] clear now to all of you who get all
[2:17:29] upset and perturbed because somebody
[2:17:31] waved an Israeli
[2:17:36] flag brother brandom says and I uh uh in
[2:17:40] a message I'll give you the moment but
[2:17:41] in Isaiah 5:26 and he will lift up a
[2:17:44] signal a sign an ins sign to call
[2:17:48] together if you're looking at King James
[2:17:50] it says an ins sign if you're looking in
[2:17:52] Amplified a signal to call together a
[2:17:54] hostile people from afar to execute his
[2:17:57] judgment on Judea and will hiss for them
[2:18:00] from the end of the Earth as the bees
[2:18:02] are hissed for excuse me as bees are
[2:18:05] hiss from their hives and behold they
[2:18:08] shall come speedily it's the lifting up
[2:18:11] of the insign that caused the Jews to
[2:18:13] come from the nations of the earth
[2:18:15] brother brandom that word insign in
[2:18:17] Hebrew something lifted up a standard a
[2:18:20] signal a banner a sign a sail or a
[2:18:25] flag He Shall Set up an inside Isaiah
[2:18:28] 11:12 for the Nations and shall assemble
[2:18:32] the outcast of Israel and gather
[2:18:34] together the dispersed of Judah from the
[2:18:36] four corners of the earth and by the way
[2:18:39] that's that's figurative
[2:18:43] language nobody fell off the corner or
[2:18:47] the Edge in a message an ins sign an
[2:18:50] insign of course we all know what an ins
[2:18:53] sign is it's something that's in
[2:18:55] commemoration lift it up something to
[2:18:57] people to look up it's something placed
[2:18:59] before you and God promised in Isaiah
[2:19:03] 5:26 there would be an inside lifted up
[2:19:06] there would be an ins sign lifted up in
[2:19:08] the message the voice of a sign 106
[2:19:11] notice what sign 106 the next one what
[2:19:15] does the sign do the sign is to attract
[2:19:18] the the attention and to get the elected
[2:19:20] ready and out of the way before judgment
[2:19:23] strikes that's why God sent the Gentiles
[2:19:26] assign he sent the Jews assign to get
[2:19:29] them
[2:19:31] home and in the message the mark of the
[2:19:33] beast and the Seal of God he says and
[2:19:36] I'm reading the Yellow Part the oldest
[2:19:38] flag in the world the six-pointed Star
[2:19:41] of David the oldest flag in the world
[2:19:44] flies for the first time for 2500 years
[2:19:47] yes and here's what he called so you you
[2:19:51] YouTube Watchers and social media
[2:19:53] stalkers and whatever else uh may be
[2:19:56] hearing this and you want to call that
[2:19:59] star of David a satanic sign in an
[2:20:02] ancient Pagan symbol I don't know what
[2:20:04] it was way back when on but I'll tell
[2:20:07] you what I know now the prophet of God
[2:20:10] Called It an ins sign that was to be
[2:20:12] lifted up to gather the Nations back to
[2:20:15] Israel and I feel very comfortable
[2:20:17] lifting it up today and reminding you
[2:20:20] that in that we have seen the
[2:20:21] Fulfillment of
[2:20:23] scripture amen the ins sign that was to
[2:20:26] be lifted up Israel Palestine blossoming
[2:20:29] as a rose you read in the magazines and
[2:20:32] watch how they come back way down in
[2:20:33] Iran and so forth so he's clear number
[2:20:37] seven we owe a huge debt of gratitude to
[2:20:40] the Jewish people for their
[2:20:41] contributions which gave birth to the
[2:20:43] Christian faith Romans 15
[2:20:46] 2627 flash it up there I don't have time
[2:20:49] to read it it uh verse 27 it ha pleased
[2:20:52] them verily and their debtors they are
[2:20:54] for if the Gentiles have been made
[2:20:58] partakers of their spiritual things
[2:21:01] their duty is also to minister unto them
[2:21:05] in carnal
[2:21:08] things carnal things the Believers of
[2:21:12] Macedonia understood an important
[2:21:14] principle salvation came to the Gentile
[2:21:16] first excuse me salvation came to the
[2:21:19] Gentile world through Israel and they
[2:21:22] were obligated to return a gift of
[2:21:24] thanks that's why they blessed the
[2:21:26] Apostle with a with a generous offering
[2:21:28] to take back to the church in Jerusalem
[2:21:30] in John 4:22 you Samaritans do not know
[2:21:33] where uh what you are worshiping you
[2:21:36] worship what you don't comprehend we do
[2:21:38] know what we are worshiping we worship
[2:21:40] what we have knowledge of and understand
[2:21:43] for after all salvation comes from among
[2:21:47] the Jews what a debt we
[2:21:50] owe what a debt we owe number eight our
[2:21:54] spiritual roots are in Israel and in the
[2:21:56] Jewish people that Romans 11 thing it's
[2:21:59] a Botanical Miracle you you you you've
[2:22:02] got something going on that that's
[2:22:04] that's miraculous yes sir Paul then
[2:22:06] describes God doing something no farmer
[2:22:08] would ever do he cuts off limbs from the
[2:22:10] natural tree and grasps Wild Olive
[2:22:14] branches in their place naturally this
[2:22:17] process is done exactly the other way
[2:22:19] around Noble branches are grafted into
[2:22:21] wild trees to improve their fruit but
[2:22:24] Paul relates this strange grafting
[2:22:26] exercise to Israel and the Gentile
[2:22:29] Nations the wild Gentiles are grafted in
[2:22:32] to the noble Jewish Olive Tree by faith
[2:22:35] in Jesus and are nourished by the rich
[2:22:37] sap of the Messianic Hope Rising from
[2:22:40] their prophets Patriarchs and Kings do
[2:22:43] not boast Romans
[2:22:45] 11:18 uh I'm hurrying do not boast over
[2:22:48] the branches and pride yourself at their
[2:22:51] expense if you do boast and feel
[2:22:53] Superior remember it is not you that
[2:22:55] support the
[2:23:03] root Ephesians 21-13 we don't have time
[2:23:06] to read it number nine now is the right
[2:23:10] time to pray and bless Israel Psalm
[2:23:13] 10216 when the Lord builds up Zion he
[2:23:16] will appear in his glory Glory you want
[2:23:18] the Lord to come in glory then we ought
[2:23:20] to pray for the building up of Zion
[2:23:22] Psalm 10213 you will arise and have
[2:23:25] mercy and loving kindness for Zion for
[2:23:28] it is time to have pity and compassion
[2:23:31] for her yes the set time has come the
[2:23:34] moment designated and how many of you
[2:23:36] know what the appointment word is in
[2:23:38] Hebrew moed it's a moed it's a moad
[2:23:41] number 10 God has changed his way of
[2:23:44] dealing with Israel this always shocks
[2:23:47] people it almost sounds it almost sounds
[2:23:51] heretical but God is the one who
[2:23:53] identifies it in Zechariah 8 11-15 read
[2:23:57] this one elas this one we can't skip but
[2:24:00] now I will not be unto the residue of
[2:24:03] this
[2:24:04] people start over but now I will not be
[2:24:08] unto the residue of this people as in
[2:24:12] the former days saith the Lord of hosts
[2:24:15] I'm going to be different toward them
[2:24:17] read on for the seed shall be prosperous
[2:24:20] the vine shall give her fruit and the
[2:24:22] ground shall give her increase and the
[2:24:25] heavens shall give their due and I will
[2:24:27] cause the remnants of this people to
[2:24:30] possess all these things see the church
[2:24:32] wants her to continue to pay for her
[2:24:34] blindness God said I once dealt with her
[2:24:36] accordingly now I'm going to help her
[2:24:39] now I'm going to bless her now I'm going
[2:24:41] to change the way I deal with her verse
[2:24:42] 13 and it shall come to pass that as ye
[2:24:46] were a curse of among the Heathen oh
[2:24:48] house of Judah and House of Israel so
[2:24:51] will I save you and ye shall be a
[2:24:53] blessing fear not but let your hands be
[2:24:57] strong for thus saith the Lord of hosts
[2:25:01] as I thought to punish you when your
[2:25:03] fathers provoked me to wrath saith the
[2:25:06] Lord of hosts and I repented not so
[2:25:10] again have I thought in these days to do
[2:25:15] well unto Jerusalem
[2:25:17] and to the house of Judah fear ye
[2:25:21] not it's not time for her to
[2:25:24] pay the set time to favor her has come
[2:25:28] the set time to bless her has come
[2:25:30] Isaiah 54 and8 in a little burst of
[2:25:32] Wrath I hid my face from you for a
[2:25:34] moment but with age enduring love and
[2:25:36] kindness I will have compassion and
[2:25:38] mercy on you says the Lord your Redeemer
[2:25:41] Ezekiel 33:11 say to them as I live says
[2:25:44] the Lord God I have no pleasure in the
[2:25:46] death of the wicked wied but rather that
[2:25:48] the wicked turn from his way and live
[2:25:51] turn back turn back from your evil ways
[2:25:54] for why will you die oh House of Israel
[2:25:58] Jeremiah 29:14 I will be found by you
[2:26:01] says the Lord and I will release you
[2:26:03] from captivity and gather you from all
[2:26:06] the nations and all the places to which
[2:26:08] I have driven you says the Lord and I
[2:26:10] will bring you back to the place from
[2:26:12] which I caused you to be carried away
[2:26:15] captive reason 11 are you still here the
[2:26:19] Jews are the family of Jesus did you
[2:26:21] hear
[2:26:25] that I love saying that to message
[2:26:27] Believers because they love saying back
[2:26:30] brother brandham said that Jesus was not
[2:26:33] a Jew did I say he was a Jew no I said
[2:26:37] the Jews are the family of
[2:26:40] Jesus this may be the simplest and one
[2:26:42] of the most profound reasons why we
[2:26:44] should love and pray for Israel and the
[2:26:46] Jewish people people Jesus was born in a
[2:26:49] Jewish Family can you dispute that no
[2:26:52] sir you see he wasn't particularly
[2:26:54] Jewish because his blood didn't come
[2:26:56] from
[2:26:59] Joseph he was born in a Jewish Family
[2:27:01] his siblings were
[2:27:03] Jewish you did know he had Earthly half
[2:27:05] siblings right they were Jewish he was
[2:27:07] raised and trained as a Jew and this may
[2:27:10] shock you he
[2:27:14] worshiped so so look brother uh tray
[2:27:17] it's like this if anybody were to have a
[2:27:20] problem with the fact that you're
[2:27:21] wearing a prayer Shaw they would have
[2:27:22] had a big problem if they would have
[2:27:24] lived in the Time of Our Lord because he
[2:27:26] wore something very similar to that in
[2:27:28] his
[2:27:30] day because he worshiped as a Jew it's
[2:27:33] another reason why we know Jesus
[2:27:37] danced because he grew up in a Jewish
[2:27:39] Family I do not believe he was the only
[2:27:42] one sitting around watching the rest of
[2:27:43] his family celebrate the Feast of
[2:27:45] Israel
[2:27:52] you dead dry starchy
[2:27:57] Christians dead Canadian dead American
[2:28:01] missionaries who go to Africa and try to
[2:28:04] make Americans out of the
[2:28:06] Africans it's a shame brother brandom
[2:28:09] didn't do it why would we do it let them
[2:28:13] worship God the way they feel to worship
[2:28:16] God go and we just should get over
[2:28:25] it this may be okay praise God Romans 9
[2:28:28] 3-5 read it Revelation 55 you'll have
[2:28:31] the notes Ellas you can just preach to
[2:28:33] the mirror you'll have it all you can
[2:28:35] just do whatever you want to do with it
[2:28:37] anybody else wants them you can have
[2:28:38] them too Revelation 55 oh this is good
[2:28:41] I've got to get this a brother came one
[2:28:44] time and he said yes it's true Jesus was
[2:28:48] born to a Jewish
[2:28:51] mother but you forgot one thing when
[2:28:54] Jesus rose from the dead he received a
[2:28:56] glorified body so he stopped being
[2:28:58] Jewish and now he is the universal
[2:29:01] brother of all
[2:29:02] mankind this sounds very impressive
[2:29:04] really doesn't it somebody's really
[2:29:06] thinking here Jesus the universal
[2:29:08] brother of mankind sounded
[2:29:10] amazing it's just not
[2:29:13] scriptural a lot of amazing things are
[2:29:15] not scriptural on because Revelation 5:5
[2:29:18] said then one of the Elders of the
[2:29:20] Heavenly Sanhedrin said to me stop
[2:29:22] weeping see the
[2:29:24] lion of the
[2:29:26] tribe of
[2:29:28] Judah somebody say
[2:29:30] Judah
[2:29:33] yehudah
[2:29:35] Yehuda this time I will praise the Lord
[2:29:39] so Jesus did not stop identifying with
[2:29:41] the root he said the stop weeping see
[2:29:45] the line of the tribe of Judah the root
[2:29:47] Source hey put this up Revelation 55
[2:29:51] Amplified the lion of the tribe of Judah
[2:29:54] the root source of David has won has
[2:29:57] overcome and conquered he can open the
[2:30:00] scroll and break its Seven Seals even in
[2:30:04] that most glorious Victorious moment he
[2:30:07] identified himself with his
[2:30:12] family and then Revelation 22:16 I Jesus
[2:30:16] have sent my messenger this is red
[2:30:19] letter to you my messenger Angel to you
[2:30:22] to witness and to give you Assurance of
[2:30:24] these things for the churches assemblies
[2:30:27] I am the root come
[2:30:32] on I am the
[2:30:34] source and The Offspring
[2:30:41] of the radiant and
[2:30:45] Brilliant any
[2:30:47] good and number
[2:30:50] 12 I'm almost as worn out as you
[2:30:54] are Isaiah 40 1-5 read it
[2:30:59] ellias Comfort ye Comfort ye my people
[2:31:02] the Bible commands us to comfort
[2:31:07] Israel sayith your God read speak ye
[2:31:11] comfortably to Jerusalem and cry unto
[2:31:14] her and her Warfare that her War
[2:31:17] is accomplished and that her iniquity is
[2:31:20] pardoned for she hath received of the
[2:31:23] Lord's hand double for all her sins how
[2:31:26] long do you think the Jewish people
[2:31:29] should pay for rejecting the Messiah
[2:31:32] when it happened because of
[2:31:37] me it's time to forgive
[2:31:39] her it's time to pray for her it's time
[2:31:43] to bless her it's time for you to go to
[2:31:46] Israel when you can and see the land and
[2:31:50] meet the
[2:31:52] people it'll change your
[2:31:54] life I was supposed to leave tomorrow
[2:31:58] two weeks from tomorrow and may
[2:32:03] still he knows may still go Can't hardly
[2:32:07] wait to get there I told my wife I know
[2:32:10] you don't understand this but I would
[2:32:12] rather be there right now than
[2:32:15] here
[2:32:17] when I was 11 years
[2:32:20] old I went on tour of Israel for the
[2:32:23] first time 1979 I'm 55
[2:32:28] now I was the only kid in the group my
[2:32:32] grandmother went to the school and
[2:32:33] begged for permission for me to go and
[2:32:35] my teacher said you can go if you bring
[2:32:37] back a report a
[2:32:39] slideshow and I
[2:32:42] did there were a lot of granny's and
[2:32:45] Grandpa on this tour we had a wonderful
[2:32:47] time of course I had got all the
[2:32:49] attention because I was the only kid so
[2:32:51] I loved every second of it this
[2:32:53] particular day they took us to yadvashem
[2:32:55] which is the memorial of the
[2:32:58] name it's the Holocaust Memorial
[2:33:03] Museum in that day it was in an old
[2:33:05] building now it's in a beautiful lovely
[2:33:07] facility that looks over the village of
[2:33:08] John the
[2:33:10] Baptist on
[2:33:12] carum beautiful Valley amazing place but
[2:33:16] in those days it was just in kind of a
[2:33:18] small building and there was a room that
[2:33:20] they took us to and the walls were
[2:33:23] covered in a mural of the Dead Jewish
[2:33:27] bodies of the
[2:33:29] Holocaust even the door when they closed
[2:33:32] the door you were completely surrounded
[2:33:35] by piles of naked Jewish bodies from the
[2:33:38] real photographs that were taken at
[2:33:41] toward the end of the Holocaust it was
[2:33:43] quite a moving very somber
[2:33:47] music and as we walked in the the guide
[2:33:50] the Jewish guide at yadvashem said to my
[2:33:52] grandmother I think this might be too
[2:33:54] much for him you might consider him
[2:33:57] going around and meeting you on the
[2:33:58] other side she said oh no he can handle
[2:34:01] it if I can handle it he can handle it
[2:34:04] she said he'll be fine but thank you so
[2:34:06] much for thinking about us and they
[2:34:08] closed those doors and they begin to
[2:34:11] tell the story of the Holocaust and the
[2:34:13] Jewish people and I began to weep and I
[2:34:15] began to hear an inner voice I know some
[2:34:18] people don't believe that God deals with
[2:34:20] people today but he does I began to hear
[2:34:22] an inner voice and I heard the dialogue
[2:34:25] of Ezekiel I Heard a Voice that said son
[2:34:28] of man can these bones live again and
[2:34:33] can you imagine I'm standing in in in in
[2:34:35] and everywhere I look are the dead
[2:34:38] bodies naked dead Jewish bodies that
[2:34:41] were piled up in ditches and and and the
[2:34:43] dirt was just pushed over them and no no
[2:34:46] one you know identifies their family
[2:34:48] members or anything the most awful thing
[2:34:51] and I'm having this spiritual experience
[2:34:53] as 11-year-old boy I heard the voice uh
[2:34:56] the inner voice of the Lord son of man
[2:34:58] can these bones live again and and I
[2:35:00] didn't say anything for a moment because
[2:35:02] I'm hearing this and it didn't dawn on
[2:35:04] me that I should answer as Ezekiel
[2:35:07] answered but when I realized what I was
[2:35:09] doing I said oh Lord thou
[2:35:11] knowest and he began to unfold the rest
[2:35:14] of that of that drama for me and instead
[2:35:17] in just a few moments time he said
[2:35:20] prophesy and as we begin to go through
[2:35:23] this in the spirit I I lost track of who
[2:35:25] I was with and why I was there and for
[2:35:28] just a few seconds of time that seemed
[2:35:29] like a long time I was just caught up
[2:35:31] into this
[2:35:34] experience and those those pictures of
[2:35:37] those dead bodies begin to transform
[2:35:39] before my eyes and I saw an army A
[2:35:43] mighty mighty Army uh this could have
[2:35:46] been in in in in in in my imagination
[2:35:49] had I not been prone to spiritual things
[2:35:52] but this was so profound and powerful
[2:35:54] and it marked my life and I couldn't
[2:35:56] explain what I'd seen except to tell
[2:35:59] what little bit of detail I've given you
[2:36:01] tonight but this afternoon but those
[2:36:04] dead bodies were no longer naked Twisted
[2:36:06] dead bodies now a mighty Army of Israel
[2:36:08] has stood on their feet and they're and
[2:36:11] and and they're stoic their chest are
[2:36:13] back and they're clothed in uh in in in
[2:36:17] uh in
[2:36:18] clothes and and in military uh gear and
[2:36:22] they're ready to fight this battle and I
[2:36:24] sobbed I'm sobbing I've been over a
[2:36:26] chair now and I'm sobbing and the little
[2:36:29] Jewish guide she said see I thought this
[2:36:31] might be too much but it wasn't that at
[2:36:34] all and when we when we stepped out my
[2:36:36] granny said honey what happened to you
[2:36:37] and I be to tell her this experience and
[2:36:40] she said' what do you think it means I
[2:36:41] said' I have no idea what it means but I
[2:36:44] know this
[2:36:46] from this day forward my heart is
[2:36:50] intricately connected with the Jewish
[2:36:53] people and the land of Israel I'll never
[2:36:57] be the same again that's the only
[2:37:00] explanation that I have for that exper
[2:37:03] for that feeling that I get when Israel
[2:37:05] is in a conflict like this there's a
[2:37:07] part of me that says I want to be there
[2:37:11] I would rather be there than here
[2:37:13] because I know that God is going to win
[2:37:15] this thing in the end I don't know how
[2:37:18] to explain it except I don't think I I'm
[2:37:21] not in any way saying don't
[2:37:23] misunderstand I'm not in any way saying
[2:37:25] that I have some specific or special
[2:37:26] role
[2:37:27] except except that I believe all
[2:37:31] believers should be Watchmen on the wall
[2:37:33] for Israel I believe it's part of our
[2:37:36] responsibility and duty to pray for the
[2:37:39] nation of Israel and for the Jewish
[2:37:41] people I want you to go back to the 12
[2:37:43] reasons let me read them again in close
[2:37:45] music positions are coming hey it's just
[2:37:47] 130 my
[2:37:51] goodness of course this wasn't presented
[2:37:54] well because it was presented
[2:37:57] quickly reason number one these are 12
[2:38:00] reasons to support Israel and the Jewish
[2:38:05] people number one Israel is the only
[2:38:08] nation on earth created by Sovereign Act
[2:38:10] of God and I believe that with every
[2:38:12] fiber of my being number two God loves
[2:38:14] Israel so I love her I love her I love
[2:38:18] her I love her her her political parties
[2:38:22] are just as argumentative as
[2:38:25] ours the lud and the conservative party
[2:38:28] and the and the advanced Liberal Party
[2:38:30] of Israel they're fighting right now
[2:38:32] they had to form an emergency Unity
[2:38:34] government to to help the nation get
[2:38:36] through War because they're so divided
[2:38:39] and they love they love to point their
[2:38:40] finger at at Benjamin Netanyahu
[2:38:43] forgetting so quickly the sacrifice that
[2:38:45] he has made for the nation of Israel for
[2:38:47] years it may be time for new blood but
[2:38:50] that's not my
[2:38:51] business my business is to
[2:38:54] pray sir I loved Ariel Chiron I've had
[2:38:58] the blessing and privilege of meeting
[2:39:00] three former Prime Ministers of Israel
[2:39:03] and shaking their hand and I was more
[2:39:05] honored by
[2:39:07] that than listening to President Obama
[2:39:09] address
[2:39:12] APAC these men have sacrificed yes so
[2:39:17] much God loves Israel number three God's
[2:39:20] a covenant keeping God number four
[2:39:23] Israel is blessed and I'm going to be
[2:39:25] blessed because I bless her number five
[2:39:27] God's jealous over his name he Hallows
[2:39:31] His holy name he's fighting for that
[2:39:33] name number six Israel is a key for
[2:39:35] Revival and blessing for the believing
[2:39:38] Church number seven we owe a huge debt
[2:39:40] of gratitude to the Jewish people reason
[2:39:43] number eight Our Roots are in Israel my
[2:39:45] RO roots are there your roots are there
[2:39:49] because of
[2:39:51] Messiah the Bible cannot be understood
[2:39:55] from a Greek mentality it can only be
[2:39:58] understood from a hebraic mentality Our
[2:40:01] Roots are there number nine now is the
[2:40:04] right time to do it if you've been a
[2:40:06] little slack in praying for Israel will
[2:40:09] you understand that the set time has
[2:40:11] come cry out to God on her behalf
[2:40:14] somebody said I don't know how to pray
[2:40:15] Pray when you don't know how to pray the
[2:40:17] spirit of God will pray through you if
[2:40:19] you follow his leadership is't that
[2:40:21] right and number two when you don't know
[2:40:23] how to pray there's here's one way you
[2:40:25] can always pray and be right on Earth
[2:40:27] Lord on Earth in Earth as it is in
[2:40:30] heaven whatever Heaven's mind is over
[2:40:33] this let it be established number 10 God
[2:40:37] has changed his way of dealing with
[2:40:38] Israel he's no longer in the business of
[2:40:41] trying to punish her or put her in Exile
[2:40:45] he's now now gathered her back
[2:40:47] in reason 11 the Jews are the family of
[2:40:50] Jesus absolutely no doubt number 12 the
[2:40:52] Bible commands us to comfort
[2:40:56] Israel father thank
[2:41:06] you thank you that you're a covenant
[2:41:08] keeping
[2:41:14] God Why Don't We
[2:41:18] Stand play something
[2:41:28] softly father thank
[2:41:30] you that your word is clear to
[2:41:33] us it is our
[2:41:35] privilege it is not only our
[2:41:37] responsibility but is our privilege to
[2:41:40] pray for
[2:41:43] Israel we are not responsible for her
[2:41:45] her salvation you
[2:41:47] are but we are responsible to live a
[2:41:50] witness before
[2:41:52] her because even the Bible tells us that
[2:41:54] in that day the Jew will take a hold of
[2:41:56] our
[2:41:57] clothes and will ask us what meanthis
[2:42:02] hope what is this inside of
[2:42:05] you where did you find this
[2:42:09] [Music]
[2:42:11] peace and it'll be our responsibility to
[2:42:13] tell them that the real peace can only
[2:42:16] be found in a personal
[2:42:20] relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:42:22] Yeshua or
[2:42:24] Messiah Lord help us to live a
[2:42:27] life in front of our Gentile
[2:42:36] Neighbors when we're contemplating our
[2:42:39] own problems and the many many problems
[2:42:41] and complexities of this nation may we
[2:42:44] not be able to forget if I forget the
[2:42:46] old
[2:42:47] Jerusalem let my right hand shrivel up
[2:42:51] let my tongue cleave to the roof of my
[2:42:54] mouth Lord don't ever let us forget to
[2:42:58] pray for the Peace of
[2:43:00] Jerusalem for the protection of the
[2:43:03] Jewish
[2:43:08] people and although we don't participate
[2:43:10] in Jewish
[2:43:12] evangelism because we believe with all
[2:43:14] of our hearts that you have made a
[2:43:15] covenant with the Jewish
[2:43:18] people and then in that day all Israel
[2:43:20] will be
[2:43:22] [Music]
[2:43:23] saved we do bear
[2:43:26] responsibility in walking out as a
[2:43:30] light to pray as Watchmen on the wall
[2:43:33] both men and
[2:43:34] women asking that your perfect will be
[2:43:37] done to th for those
[2:43:39] people we are not cold and
[2:43:42] insensitive to the needs of the Arab
[2:43:45] Nation s or to the needs of the
[2:43:47] wandering
[2:43:49] Palestinians our hearts go out to
[2:43:52] them we pray Lord that you will open
[2:43:55] their eyes that they would absolutely
[2:43:57] refuse to
[2:43:59] participate in
[2:44:03] terrorism may they even it would be a
[2:44:05] great Jeopardy of their life a risk but
[2:44:09] would you strengthen them to stand
[2:44:11] against tamas and
[2:44:14] Hezbollah
[2:44:16] to say this is not our
[2:44:20] fight I pray for the safe Escape of
[2:44:23] those who need to be
[2:44:25] out I heard this morning from someone
[2:44:28] that we trust in the
[2:44:31] land that reports were coming in that
[2:44:35] Hamas was
[2:44:36] stealing car
[2:44:39] keys from Palestinians who wanted to
[2:44:42] flee the corridor of
[2:44:44] Hope
[2:44:46] hoping that the casualties would be
[2:44:47] higher and that more people would hate
[2:44:49] Israel my heart goes out to those
[2:44:55] [Music]
[2:44:57] people you told us once Lord as we
[2:45:00] prayed for the Arab people that you
[2:45:01] would show
[2:45:04] up and we had testimonies come
[2:45:07] in in multiple from multiple places that
[2:45:11] you were showing up in
[2:45:13] homes God
[2:45:16] revealing yourself to Arab
[2:45:18] people and they were calling
[2:45:21] you to be the god of heaven and finding
[2:45:25] Mercy in your
[2:45:27] presence do it again Lord yes
[2:45:31] [Music]
[2:45:34] Lord we thank you for
[2:45:37] election we thank you that not one in
[2:45:40] your forn knowledge will be
[2:45:44] lost
[2:45:47] Lord may we not be bogged down by the
[2:45:49] demonic
[2:45:50] spirits that would desire to stir hatred
[2:45:53] in our
[2:45:55] hearts toward the Jewish people in the
[2:45:57] land of
[2:45:58] Israel melt us together
[2:46:03] today let us see the responsibility Lord
[2:46:06] I want to thank you for a prophet who
[2:46:09] believed with all of his heart that the
[2:46:11] Modern Nation of Israel was a
[2:46:12] fulfillment of scripture one who told us
[2:46:16] watch watch watch watch if you want to
[2:46:19] know what God is about to do in the
[2:46:21] church watch the Jew he said so today
[2:46:25] Lord our eyes and our hearts are turned
[2:46:27] toward Israel and toward the Jewish
[2:46:33] people may you do everything that you
[2:46:36] promised and give them victory in this
[2:46:38] trying
[2:46:41] hour with his little loss of innocent
[2:46:44] life
[2:46:45] Liv as
[2:46:49] possible Lord it Grieves us to think
[2:46:53] that one
[2:46:54] mother on either side of this
[2:46:57] conflict would lose a
[2:47:00] child my heart
[2:47:03] breaks I can't stand the
[2:47:08] thought but Lord you
[2:47:11] know you know more than we know we're
[2:47:13] just little peons here
[2:47:15] trying to figure it out but you're a God
[2:47:17] who saw it from before the foundation of
[2:47:20] the
[2:47:21] world I don't know how to bring the
[2:47:23] promises of God to pass for Israel but
[2:47:26] you do you're the one who made them
[2:47:29] you're the Covenant keeping God I bless
[2:47:32] your name I bless your name I bless your
[2:47:36] name Yahweh I bless
[2:47:41] you I bless
[2:47:43] you
[2:47:58] Jesus Spirit of the Living
[2:48:04] God thank you for
[2:48:07] Angels Lord I sat with gersan
[2:48:11] Solomon a living witness of the of the
[2:48:14] liberation of the city of
[2:48:16] Jerusalem we heard him tell the story
[2:48:19] with his own
[2:48:20] mouth that there were men who appeared
[2:48:25] that day on the Temple
[2:48:27] Mount
[2:48:29] dressed in Robes of desert tan and
[2:48:34] white and walked among the
[2:48:40] soldiers assisting them in liberation in
[2:48:45] the Temple
[2:48:48] Mount he saw them with his
[2:48:52] eye and testified that the enemy ran so
[2:48:55] quickly away they ran out of their
[2:49:02] sandals when
[2:49:04] they fighting was over and when they
[2:49:07] wanted to thank this unknown
[2:49:12] host they couldn't find them anywhere
[2:49:19] when the tank ran over gersan
[2:49:23] Solomon crushing his legs and leaving
[2:49:25] him forever
[2:49:27] crippled he was left there to
[2:49:30] die but a man dressed in radiant
[2:49:33] white he testified to us came and picked
[2:49:38] him
[2:49:39] up and carried him back to his comrades
[2:49:46] and when they tried to find him to thank
[2:49:48] him he was gone Lord that's what we need
[2:49:51] right now we call for Angelic
[2:49:55] intervention in the land of
[2:49:59] Israel rise up host of the
[2:50:04] Lord let the jealousy of God be
[2:50:07] Vindicated in that
[2:50:09] land he's jealous for his people he's
[2:50:13] jealous for that land
[2:50:17] may this be the birthing of a Revival
[2:50:20] among the Arab
[2:50:22] people God you're not willing that any
[2:50:24] should
[2:50:26] perish it's your desire the scripture
[2:50:28] told us this morning that wicked men
[2:50:30] would turn from their Wicked Ways and
[2:50:33] not have to pay with their own
[2:50:40] blood I trust you we as a body trust
[2:50:47] you show us what to
[2:50:52] do show us what to
[2:50:56] do wake us up in the night
[2:50:59] hour when somebody needs help Lord let
[2:51:03] us let one of
[2:51:07] us catch the prayer
[2:51:11] assignment it's easy to go about our
[2:51:13] regular lives
[2:51:18] forgetting that the promises of God seem
[2:51:22] to be up for
[2:51:24] grabs make us
[2:51:28] mindful we don't want to be
[2:51:31] Fanatics we want to be
[2:51:34] mindful in a church world who wants to
[2:51:37] see the Jews punished let this little
[2:51:39] bride stand up on her behalf and cry out
[2:51:42] for her help

[2:52:02] time and will come the second time and
[2:52:04] we believe he's coming the first time
[2:52:07] and I've said to them many many times
[2:52:09] but the thing for you to know is he is
[2:52:11] one in the
[2:52:13] same
[2:52:15] bethlehem's
