Description:
We are not looking to call angels on the scene, but we can call God on the scene.  However, we want to create an atmosphere where angels are welcome to take their position.  In the season we are in now, if we would rededicate our lives to the Lord, we will see the supernatural increase.  Just by simply saying, “It is for me.  I am called to be a supernatural believer…” 
If we mean that with our whole heart, it is enough for the supernatural to greatly increase in our lives.  Amen!

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we want to create an atmosphere that makes all of the Heavenly hosts welcome to come [Music] I'm not looking to to to call Angels on the scene I can call God on the scene but I'm wanting to create an atmosphere in my life and in my worship and in my service when I'm together with you that that angels feel free but the random called them into place he said may they come and take up their their positions along these walls and along these aisles and pews they're here to minister praise God so we're not going to start some big Focus but we're going to say that we believe that angels are with us and that they are among us and we want to create an atmosphere that makes all of the Heavenly hosts welcome to come I tell you they're not welcome they don't desire to be and dead dry emotionless structured you you couldn't even call it worship it's a stretch to call it a song service don't you settle for that don't you settle for that don't you be guilty of that and don't you let anybody shame you because you want something more than that we want an atmosphere where God can come and move and do what he desires to do in our lives where he can reach out over that camera and impact people's lives we want a place where angels can come and work and minister in the Heavenly Host and even the cloud of witnesses you better be looking to find a place to do what God has called you to do and if you don't know what he's called you to do do something for the kingdom according to the word do something good and don't be surprised if when you commit and rededicate your life to the Lord especially in Seasons like we're in right now don't be surprised if your association with the Unseen World and the supernatural does not increase it it's very possible and quite probable that your association with the Unseen World and the supernatural will indeed increase because you've just come to believe that it's for you just simply saying it's for me the Supernatural is for me I'm called to be a supernatural believer and meaning that with all your heart is enough to cause your association with the Unseen World and the supernatural to greatly increase if you believe that squeeze out an amen [Music]
