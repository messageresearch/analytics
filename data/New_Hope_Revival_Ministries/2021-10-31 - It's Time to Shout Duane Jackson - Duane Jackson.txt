[Music] man [Music] oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we receive your blessing lord we receive your blessing lord [Music] hallelujah when brother dwayne was preaching last night this song came into my mind so i wanted to sing it this morning [Music] oh what i would do to have the kind of faith it takes to climb out of this [Music] under the crashing waves to step out of my comfort zone into the realm of the unknown where jesus is and he's holding out his hand but the waves are calling out my name and they laugh at me they're reminding me of all i tried before it failed and the waves they keep on telling me time and time again boy you'll never win no you'll never win but the voice of truth tells me a different story the voice of truth says do not be afraid and the voice of truth says this is for my glory out of all the voices calling out to [Music] the truth sing that first verse again [Music] and do what i would do to have the kind of faith it takes to come out of this boat i mean under the crashing waves just a step out of my comfort zone and to the realm of the unknown where jesus is and he's holding out his hand but the waves are calling out my name and they laugh at me they're just reminding me of all the times i've tried before and failed and the ways they keep on telling me just time and time again boy you'll never win no you'll never win [Music] but that voice are truth it tells me a different story the voice of truth says do not be afraid and the voice of truth it says this is for my glory out of all the voices calling out to me oh and i will choose to listen and believe [Music] strength it takes to stand before a gyre with just a sling and a stone surrounded by the sound of the thousand warriors just a shaking in their armor wishing they'd have had the strength to stand and that giant's calling out my name and he laughs at me he just reminds me of all the times i've tried before and failed and the giant keeps on telling me time and time again boy you'll never win no you'll never win but the voice of truth it tells me a different story the voice of truth says do not be afraid and the voice of truth says this is for my glory out of all the voices calling out to me [Music] and i will choose to listen and believe the voice and the voice of truth tells me a different story the voice of truth says the voice of truth says this is for my glory calling out to me i will choose [Music] i want you to come back and sing that verse i know we're going late in the music and there are special songs this morning but we're here with the divine appointment we're we've come to meet the lord and uh you know how i feel about that song it is not a song that i would listen to at home it's not southern gospel so to me it's it's just not me but i want you to know those words are for me and they are for you and nobody sings it better than people like us and so we can take a song that doesn't sound quite like us and we can make it be more like us what we're used to and i appreciate that so much i every time we sing it i get this image in my mind of thousands of soldiers [Music] standing there as the lyrics say shaking in their armor wishing that they would have had the strength to stand i don't know how many of them could have been the ones would have liked to have been the one but there was one [Applause] we started out friday night by saying god wants to meet with somebody this weekend and we encourage the young people to go after that and to say if there's only one if only one has that meeting with the lord it's going to be me it takes a determination i just want to sing it again because it speaks to my heart because i know there are people who stand on the edges desiring to be the one desiring to take up the stone and take up the sling and slay the giant in their life once and for all there was a discussion at the table last night about the lyrics of a song with david that talks about how did it go david tell me we cut off the giant's head we eat giants for our bread and he he like me when you hear that the first time it's a little bit odd and it's based on a peculiar interpretation of a scripture but i want you to know something i also understand this morning the passion and the anger that can rise up in you in a holy manner when you recognize there's one giant standing between you and being yielded to the call of god on your life david may not have eaten goliath but i tell you what he did he put his head up on a pole way up high in the air and he said let everybody see this is what happens to those who defy the armies of the most high god and you'd better fear you'd better fear or your head may be the next head that's what he was saying so there's a part of me that says i understand that and i might just have a giant for breakfast we don't mean literally we mean figuratively i want that enemy in your life to be so ultimately dead that there is no way of recognizing his twisted torn mutilated carcass that lays on the battlefield of your life there is victory there is victory over every giant that races up to destroy you now i encourage you young people don't you be one of those soldiers standing looking on wishing that you would have had the courage to make a stand against that enemy that won't he listen he don't want to break you he wants to kill you he wants to eat you for breakfast and if you don't make that stand for that against that giant in your life nobody else can your pastor can't your parents can't your husband can't you've got to make a stand you've got to be willing to say i'm not going to be that one that stands there afraid i'm gonna be that little giant that little giant the one who was so small in stature ready in complexion who took on a battle that really wasn't his you see the battle belonged to the lord but david recognized i'm the one he's counting on we used to sing a song strange song brother duane years ago called paul's ministry did you ever hear that old song here's how the chorus went he said i counted on adam i counted on this one cane i counted on and i can't remember who now he was the same i counted on this one and he proved untrue you go tell the world paul i'm counting on you i feel like god's counting on some of us here this morning and we're not going to let him down i'll tell you i feel like flying if you see me go out across just don't be disturbed oh what i would do to have the kind of strength it takes to stand before a giant with just a sling and a stone surrounded by the sound of the thousand warriors just shaking in their armor and wishing they'd have had the strength to stand then the giant's calling out my name and he laughs at me he's just reminding me of all the times i've tried before in fail and the giant keeps on telling me time and time again boy you'll never win no you'll never win but the voice of truth tells me a different story the voice of truth says do not be afraid and the voice of truth says this is for my glory out of all the voices calling out to me and i will choose to listen and [Music] the kind of strength it takes to stand before his eyes with just a sling and a stone surrounded by the sound of a thousand warriors shaking in their armor and wishing they'd have had the strength to stare and the giant's calling out in my name and he laughs at me he's reminding me of all the times i've tried before in faith and the giant keeps on telling me just time and time again boy you'll never win oh you'll never win and the voice of truth tells me a different story the voice of truth says do not be afraid and the voice of truth says this is for my glory out of all the voices calling out to me and i wanna choose to listen and believe the voice in the voice of truth it tells me a different story the voice of truth says do not be afraid and the voice of truth says this is for my glory out of all the voices calling out to me and i will choose to listen and believe the voice sing that second verse loud again [Music] and do what i would do to have the kind of faith it takes to stand before you die with just a sling and a stone surrounded by the sound of a thousand warriors just shaking in their armor and wishing they'd have had the strength to stand cause the giants calling out in my name and he laughs at me he's just reminding me of all the times i've tried before and failed and the giant keeps on telling me time and time again boy you'll never win no you'll never wish but that voice of truth it tells me a different story the voice of truth says do not be afraid and the voice of truth says this is for my glory out of all the voices calling out to me oh and i will choose to listen and believe the voice in the voice i'll tell you what i think you ought to do i think you ought to lift up a victory shout to the lord i think you ought to just lift up your voice and shout to the lord i believe you'll do that god will help you right now hallelujah hallelujah he's worthy glory glory lived up be a different story the voice of truth says do not be afraid in the voice of truth it says this is for my glory out of all the voices calling out to me when i will choose to listen and believe the voice in the voice of truth tells me a different story the voice of truth says [Music] and [Music] and the voice of truth tells me a different story the voice of truth says do not be afraid in the voice of truth says this is for my glory out of all the voices calling out to and i will choose to listen and believe the voice of truth hallelujah [Music] so lift up the

are holding on to hope and they're holding on to faith and they're believing they're believing and we're believing with them that god is sovereign and we know his perfect will is going to be done but there's nothing that causes us to feel defeated so if you don't feel defeated you might ought to just carry on praising him and decreeing faith and holding on to hope so one last time before we move

[Applause] jesse will you and josiah come uh would we could we get those bags back make sure we have two bags would you all come here and hold the offering bag well we just had an offering i know we did but we're going to take a special offering the church will also help brother dwayne because we want him to be blessed and we want them to know how much we appreciate the ministry that he has given us this weekend can i get a witness from the testimony at the banquet until the service last night you may be seated you're tired i know to the service last night to just his presence here this morning we're not used to through the years we've had some wonderful brothers but you know everybody has a different way about them and some people are not worshipers by nature we're so blessed to have a preacher who's a worshiper who doesn't just sit back and watch us worship he'd be he'd be sitting back a long time watching it but he enters in and i don't know if you know it or not but because you believe in worship subconsciously you give him more attention when he gets up here to bring the word because you can see that he participates in what he's saying and i appreciate it so much i didn't go down back there last night to forsake you i did it because i can be distracting to other people and so i went to the back because i wanted every young person to be able to have their attention on what was being said and a foundation was being laid and laid and laid i'm telling you what it was something else the sound of those wooden rulers breaking around the altar last night was powerful and when i got home to my house we were still trying to unplug lights and do things so we were the last last vehicle to get out of here not to get out of here but to get home some were still talking in the parking lot and when i walked in there was already a testimony service going on and testimonies were already being shared of what the lord had done in the service last night we discovered something we discovered that some people like like hunter for instance and and maybe he'll give his testimony tuesday night of what he feels like the lord did for him but but he's like me he he was so moved by what happened in the breaking of that ruler that he stuck that those pieces in his pocket and he plans to hold on to them that's just like me and when he sees them he's going to remember that thing has no hold on me why are you grinning uh some people like benjamin are more like their mother in this regard and that is when they got done with their ruler pieces brother dwayne i should be telling you they throw them in the trash because they didn't ever want to see them again and when i woke up this morning i said to myself they're both right to the one who needs a memorial hunter's got a memorial to the ones who don't ever want to have to ever see or think about that stuff again it went out in the trash and there was just one problem and that was jenna wanted benjamin to keep hers where is she and he didn't so i went out this morning and tried to find them in the trash but that those bags were already gone so i had to come back so whether whether she meant it or not you're never going to see them again it's gone i am so thankful for what the lord accomplished for the streamers testimonies began to come in during the service last night of what god was doing for streamers and how he was speaking to their hearts from the message that was going forth so the ministry that brother jackson has brought to us this weekend has gone out beyond the church i want to thank god that others have been able to benefit from his ministry and we believe that a laborer is worthy of his hire and that's all that we need to say i want you to ask the lord even now what he would have you to give every single penny every dollar every check every bit of this will go to brother jackson and we will also uh give him an offering from the church from the from the ministry here but i want them to be blessed don't you so would you get that together right now and let's come and prepare to bless the man of god and he'll be coming in just a moment to preach i don't want you to rush him i want us to get all we can get out of them because he's getting more invitations now and it may be harder to book him in the future so we want to get all we can out of him while he's here amen one more time while you're getting your check together or cash together or whatever you're doing i want to thank every person who has worked hard for our young people this week they appreciate it i want you to know that i want you to know sister laurel my wife these uh girls who did so much with the decorating i didn't want to call any names but charity grace and kendra and so many more have made such an effort to make it very very special and we thank you for that and we thank those of you who prayed that god would show up he did so no matter what you've done brother my wife wanted to mention that brother greeley's heater came through we didn't know the weather was going to change the way it did and we were able to stay warmer than we would have and some of you were warm enough and some of you we didn't quite make it there but you know the enemy would like to have really threw us for a loop and when they looked up and saw those tents hanging in the trees out there where they were trying to get them twisted around and set on the ground and plastic connectors began to pop well they didn't know what it was going to be like but you know the lord had it all in his great big capable hands amen i want you to stand again please this is pentecostal service we are up and down hopefully not in our life but in our worship and i want you to come as the lord would lead you and bring an offering for our brother dwayne jackson and he'll be with us in just a moment here to take take us right to the word let's sing what a day that will be just the chorus a time or two as they come to give what a day that will be when my jesus i shall see when i look upon his face the one who saved me by his grace and he takes me by the hand and leads me through the promised land what a day what a glorious day that will be one more time the chorus what a day that is gonna be what a day that will be when my jesus i shall see when i look upon his face the one who saved me by his grace and

that we feel among us this morning lord we know that when you come that there is a purpose for it we believe that we're standing right here right now for a divine purpose of god that you have come to speak to us this morning would you help the lord's lord to get out of the way each and every one of us lord that we might yield ourselves to you that you might have preeminence in this service this morning help me father to speak what you would have to be said lord i don't want any of my thoughts to be intermingled i want it to be completely and directly from you this morning in jesus name we pray and we thank you for it lord amen hallelujah hallelujah i tell you what a time of praise that we have had this morning you know and maybe some people look at it brother steve and you know we were talking last night at how some might might look they may stream the the service and and looking for something to critique and and they say well um this is how it's been said at our church before i'll put it this way um brother brother dan daisley used to say when somebody come and visit or something they would watch the service they're like well that's not how we do it at our church and he said well you're not at your church you're at our church so enter in and worship and uh and that's how that's how i believe we're not um we're not it's not here for a show i don't believe any of you here are here for a show this morning i believe that you're here to enter into worship because you have a need i come with a need this morning i hope that you've come and you're laying your need before him and we worship we bring him on the scene and he comes to meet every single need that we have you know i think some people get caught up in that um we've read at the maybe last night the book of ephesians and it says putting on the whole armor of god that was in the songs they were singing it says to having done all to stand yes sir but i think some people misinterpret that brother steve they said i've done everything i've done it all and i'm going to be dignified and i'm going to come to church and i'm going to stand because my bible says to stand therefore so they uh well i didn't i'm talking about people at my church that that have that have done that before and then they kind of just stand there and nothing you say is going to move me and nothing you say is going to change my opinion and change what i think and what i do because my bibles told me i could just stand so i'm going to stand that's not what it's about they're going to stand in the way it's what they're going to do and that's not what it's about you know i was listening a few weeks ago y'all be seated for just a minute i'll forget that you're standing and you'll stand as long as as as i am um but i guess it'd be all right i mean that'd be all y'all forgive me i don't know how these these uh brothers can sing and do all that for so long and oh they're they can go yes thank you so much i'm sorry i i forget about those formalities and at our church once somebody just stands up they just leave they just leave sometimes um but you know i i believe that um some people have taken that the wrong way and and they they look at it from that you know i'm just gonna i'm standing i'm doing what the bible says i'm just standing and and that's not what it's about now i was just as i was starting to say i was cutting my grass several weeks back and and listening to uh one of brother brandon's messages and he got telling the story of a time that he was he was up and i forgot where he was at maybe up in canada and he was trying to to to get close enough to a bear that he could take a picture of it and um and he got into an area and it was it was overcast and and dark and the clouds was there and um he got into this little area and uh he sat sit down there for a minute and as he was sitting there in the quiet he started hearing creaking sounds it was like a moaning sound and he didn't know what it was and it was it was kind of disconcerting you know what what's going on why am i hearing these sounds he said it was kind of if you listen to the message he said it felt kind of a spooky place and um he says and then whenever the the clouds moved out of the way and the the moon shone through he saw these old dead trees that was standing there and as the wind was trying to move those dead trees it sounded spooky they would creak and i think too many times there's too many dead trees [Music] he said they look like tombstones is what it's what what he said they look like big tombstones up there and i think sometimes people get uh get set in their ways and um they they become those uh those tombstones that's just standing and the wind of the holy spirit moves through and it tries to move them and they just stand stiff and you're not going to move me bless god i'm going to stand right here and that's not what we're supposed to do but he said he looked and he saw some young tender undergrowth and as that same breeze blew through there that young undergrowth he said it was just swaying in the wind it was just swaying in the wind while there's big dead trees that stood there they've been there forever and they stood there and they just stood stiff and they moaned and groaned but that young tender undergrowth as the wind of the holy ghost would come through they would just sway and they would sway it was the same wind but it affected different people different ways in in 19 this isn't part of my message but this was just something that was good so i had to write it down um in in 1957 um brother branham it was preaching a message why some people can't keep the victory didn't say that they didn't had not had the victory but why they can't keep the victory and he says we need a holy ghost experience in the church of the living god you know that is true we need to be greened up livened up if life makes you act green then go ahead and get life that's right and that's what we need this morning we need to get life if that's what it's going to take to get us greened up and swaying in the wind and moving that's what we want to do this morning amen amen i take well sermon number one that one's a short one we'll get that one out of the way how many come expecting this morning i didn't know we had that many pregnant people here we are he got it he got it see when some people say i'm expecting that means they're with child and there's a thing about being expecting it makes you act different it makes you walk different it changes your appetite many times you have different desires for different things to feed on so if you've really come expecting this morning and you have him growing inside of you it will change the way you walk it will change the way you know when when a when a sister becomes expecting she has to change her attire she does she has to dress according to that because it changes her and she has to get different clothes well sometimes that's what needs to happen to us sometimes if you have him dwelling inside of you it's gonna it's gonna show up on the outside too and it will show up in how how we dress and we need to dress appropriately of being showing this world that we are expecting we are with child of the holy spirit and that is what's growing inside of us this morning hallelujah hallelujah could you stand with me and we'll read as i told you um they've already uh they've already preached my message for me this morning after listening to the the special last night um i was struggling i had um struggling between a couple thoughts and that the lord had laid on my heart and uh i was really kind of battling my mind as we we came down as to the direction that that i was supposed to go this morning and i felt in my heart that that that this was the right way and in the group saying last night and immediately i'm like well thank you lord that's my confirmation that's my confirmation and then the other songs that was sung last night tied right into what i was talking about and breaking the rules and having a breakthrough and and i'm just i i feel so blessed that god would come down and speak to me see that wasn't for you that was for me that he came down and spoke that to me and in in psalms 100 in verse 4. i'll read verse 4 and then let you have your seats and then we'll uh maybe we'll read a few more verses out of psalms 100. and this is a verse that again you don't have to worry about me bringing anything new to you because all i'm going to do is remind you what's been said in the word i just want to stir up your mind your pure minds this morning with the word psalms 100 verse 4 how about we read it together it says enter into his gates with thanksgiving and into his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name hallelujah you can you can have your seats this morning no it's not morning now this afternoon if you'll allow me i'd like to read um verses one through five um of this of psalms 100 says make a joyful noise unto the lord all ye lands serve the lord with gladness come before his presence with singing that's what we've done this morning know ye that the lord he is god it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the sheep of his pasture enter into his gates with thanksgiving that means hands raised and into his courts with praise which is singing be thankful unto him and bless his name for the lord is good his mercy is everlasting and his truth endureth to all generations the the songs that were sung this morning to your family into their children and to their children and to their children and i was as the song was going on in my mind i'm thinking y'all are preaching my message you're singing my message this morning because the lord is good and his mercy is everlasting and his truth endureth to all generations if you look back in verse three there's there's three words in verse three that just really when i when i was studying this and i came across this part it just really struck me brother steve it says we are his it says we are his people but the three words we are his i was like my that's enough to stop and just rejoice for ages and ages to know that he claims me to know that i am his and if i'm his he is mine and i just i got so excited just to just to read that we are his and i just i felt that was just a reason to worship it was a reason to praise it was a reason for us to get a little bit loud this morning i think some people may get a little frightened by that i don't think this church does but i know of other churches that do they get a little frightened when people get a little loud and they're like oh you got to look at church order and you got to do this and you got to do that well i think brother sometimes brother brother branham would say it's maybe we need to get a little bit out of order so we can get into him you know we get stuck in our own ways and in our traditions and those type things we need to get a little out of order sometimes to to be yielded to him to what he wants us to do and enter into his presence this morning but to know that we are his which that tells me i am his by creation because he created me i am his by creation i am his by redemption [Music] god looks at you and says you're twice mine because i made you i created you and then i redeemed you so now you are twice mine by rights we belong to him but he wants you to make that choice to belong back to him he wants you to make that personal choice that you're going to receive him as who he is and he that and understand that his desire is to fill your life completely and to me that is a reason to shout and that's my title this morning it's time to shout wow it's time to shout out and as i said you have preached my message for me this morning so all i'm gonna do is just gonna just come in and give you the word to back up everything that you've already been singing everything that you've already been doing this morning in psalm 47 verse 1 it says oh clap your hands all ye people shout unto god with the voice of triumph hallelujah we praise your wonderful name lord hallelujah you know we're not we're not shouting at god we're not angry at god we're not shouting at god we're shouting unto him we are lifting our praise to him we are lifting our adoration to him our worship to him we're not angry with god we love him and we want him to to receive our love that we can express because there's so many things that he can do for you that you can't do back for him all we can do is give him our praise we can give him our worship this morning you know the word shout that's used there as i was looking it up i like to look up definitions of things and it actually meant make a joyful noise which we know that split the ears with sound that's pretty loud to split the ears with sound that is a loud noise that is a loud shout in the book of luke 19 and people want to be quiet in church well they're not reading the same bible that i'm reading they're not reading it luke chapter 19 verses 36 through 40 it says and as he went they spread their clothes in the way and when he was come nigh even now at the descent of the mount of olives the whole multitude the whole multitude it wasn't just one or two out of a group but it was the entire multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise god with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen saying blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest they weren't being quiet they were not being quiet they were not saying well blessed be the name blessed be the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord no that was not how they were being blessed is the king that cometh they had a message that they were wanting to tell people there's a king that's coming you may not know him but i know him and i want you to know him how i know him blessed is the king that cometh in the name of the lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest and some of the pharisees from among the multitudes said unto him master rebuke thy disciples tell them to hush up this is not church order this is not how we do it in our church in our assembly and he answered and said unto them i tell you that if these should hold their peace i'll put it this way if you were to hold your peace the stones would immediately cry out there is going to be a praise for my god i want that praise to come from me i'm not going to wait for you to praise him i'm going to praise him i'm going to worship him because i love him and he loves me and he's told me that i am his [Music] i am his what more do you need to know that i'm his i don't need anything more you could close the book up and put everything else aside but i know that he told me you're mine you're mine and i'll do anything and i have done everything to bring you back to me because that's where i want you he wants you right by his side he he offers to you in the scripture he says take my yoke upon you okay a yoke com it joins two people or two animals in the scripture now he would never have offered to you jesus would never have offered to you to take a portion of his yoke upon you if you were not equally yoked with him because he knew the scripture that you're not supposed to be unequally yoked so he's not going to stand there and offer you to stand by his side and join that yoke with him unless you're equal with him the only way you're going to be equal with him is that you have to have him living inside of you he has imparted a part of himself to you so you have the right to stand by his oh glory to god to stand by his side i know that i am his i know he invited he invited moses to stand in the cliff he said come come here moses stand by my side on this rock he didn't tell moses to get away from him he invited moses to stand beside him he made a place for him in the cleft of the rock he's made his place for you in the cleft of the rock and he has invited you he says come stand beside my side stand right here oh my why would you want to go anywhere else whenever you have an opportunity to stand beside jesus because whenever you know that you're beside him all your worries are gone all your problems have been taken care of i can't get over the fact just the three simple words we are his if you can ever get that revelation if you can ever grasp a hold of that that he has made claim to you and if he's made claim to you he will not lose you he will not lose you i don't care what the situation is i don't care what the problem is we talked last night about all the different things that satan was trying to bind you up in but all that was broken last night all of that's behind us it's it's in our past we don't look back to that no more we're looking forward to what god has for us right now there needs to be a noise of praise in the camp and that noise needs to be saying jesus is coming jesus is coming that's what they were that's what those disciples were saying people may not even knew who jesus was you got to think about that we look at it from our perspective we're reading the bible so we knew what they were talking about there were many there had no clue who he was what does that even matter who's who's jesus who's jesus you need to meet my jesus that's what they were trying to tell them jesus is coming the king of glory is among us and you need to meet him hallelujah praise his name in ecclesiastes three and seven it says there's a time to rend a time to sow a time to keep silence and too many people have stayed right there they got stuck in that verse there's a time to keep silence and there's a time to speak we're in that time to speak they they sung the song oh my goodness they were singing that song last night and i couldn't help myself i just i was just getting so overjoyed because i i didn't share with you what brother steve never once asked me what what's uh you know what's the lord giving to you what's what's on the plate for us i haven't spoken to anybody here the only person that knew potentially what i was going to talk about this morning was sister heather and i don't think she went and talked to the people that was going to be singing and said you know what y'all need to sing a song that that would fit with that no that was divinely orchestrated by god because he knew the struggle i was having inside of me but he knew what you needed this morning he knows what we have need of at every single moment and he will give you the words to speak if he says there is a time to speak he will give you the words to speak in the appropriate time he will place as i said i think maybe last night or things last night um that that he will place his words in your mouth because he does not want you speaking what you think god does not need what you think he does not need what i think he does not need my opinion on the matter all he needs is his word it is written he needs his word spoken forth and that's what's going to defeat the enemy every place every time but we have to be obedient we have to be obedient to speak at his command because sometimes he comes in and he's he's desiring you to speak he he gives you a word in your heart in your mind to speak maybe to speak to someone to speak before the church and you squelch it and you dampen it you're like oh i think that was just me they're just going to think that that was my opinion on that no if he gave you the word to speak it needs to be spoken it needs to be done in order but it needs to be spoken if he places his word in you it needs to be spoken we have to say what he has said we have to speak at his command i think this has already been said this morning too our worship our worship draws us closer to christ [Music] if you don't know that you shouldn't know it by now our worship draws us closer to him our praise lifts him up in adoration and i i got to thinking one day i i do a lot of my thinking when i'm cutting grass so i listen to the messages or i listen to the bible and so the lord deals with me many times i'll be out cutting grass we got about eight acres to to cut between my place and my dad's place and so i can just be out there for a few hours and just listen it's my alone time and um it started raining while i was out there and that's one thing you don't want to do while you're trying to cut grass because then you get in a place of well if i don't finish it now it's going to look terrible because i got half of the yard done you know so i or if i'm going to have to try to come back later and wait for the grass to dry out but i was i was cutting grass and it started raining a little bit and as i looked up watching it rain and it it came to me that most of the time we say the the rain we see the rain falling down the rain is falling down well actually the rain is not falling the rain is being pulled down because of gravity right gravity is what draws it down to the earth so it didn't just fall it was a purpose and the gravity is what drew it down to earth and what i started thinking about is that our praise our worship is that gravity that draws god on the scene if you have a need and you start worshiping you start praising you start praying you start lifting his name on high he shows up he didn't just fall there but it was a it was drawn there the the need that you have you know there's so many people that are needy people and sometimes if you know of of a person that's a needy person you might try not to be around them that much because it seems like every time i'm around them they they need me to do this they need me to do that they need this need that need need need and there's people that are that way some people are givers they're all all the time give give give give but see when god looks at it and he sees a needy person it's attractive to him [Music] your need is what makes you attractive to god to other people your need might be a distraction it might push them off but god don't see it that way he looks at you and he says oh there's a need there and i've expressed my need to him and he says i can go and take care of that because i have what they need i am what they need and he comes your need is what draws him on the scene but there's there's steps you need to worship him you need to praise him you need to pray to him you need to lift his name in adoration and that calls him on the scene every single time and whenever you're in his presence what does the bible say in his presence there is fullness of joy our shout brings a deliverance to our situation now see this was going to be my my big part of the the message and they've already took my thunder brother steve because of the song they sung i'm partly to blame because i asked him to sing it this morning but after hearing it last night i just i had to so um so if you will allow me i'd like to read to you the story of jericho out of joshua chapter 6 verses 1 through 20 and read that for you right quick and just do a little a little bible lesson now jericho was straightly shut up because of the children of israel none went out and none came in and the lord said unto joshua see i have given into thine hand jericho and the king thereof and the mighty men of valor and ye shall compass the city all ye men of war and go round about the city once keep in mind it was men of war we'll come back to that in a minute go around about the city once thus shalt thou do six days and seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of ram's horns so thankful brother greeley picked up that horn this morning and was blowing the trumpet i'm like well we're gonna need that here in a little while and when you hear the sound of the trumpet and all the people shall shout with a great shout i think i've skipped down into verse 5. shout with a great shout and the wall of the city shall fall flat down flat and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him and joshua the son of done called the priest and said unto them take up the ark of the covenant and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of ram's horns before the ark of the lord and he said unto the people pass on and come past the city and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the lord and it came to pass when joshua had spoken unto the people that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of ram's horns passed on before the lord and blew with the trumpets and the ark of the covenant of the lord followed them and the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets and the rearward rearward came after the ark the priest going on and blowing with the trumpets and joshua had commanded the people saying you shall not shout in other words you're going to have to be quiet nor make any noise with your voice neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day i bid you shout all right then then shall ye shout so the ark of the lord compassed the city going about it once and they came into the camp and launched in the camp and we'll skip down a couple verses you you know the the story that were that we're talking here came to pass a verse 16 verse 15 i'm sorry it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose early about the dawning of the day and compassed the city after the same matter seven times only on that day they could pass the city seven times it was only on that seventh day that they compassed seven times and it came to pass at the seventh time when the priest blew with the trumpets joshua said unto the people shout for the lord hath given you the city they didn't take the city the lord had given them the city and the city shall be accursed even it and all therein to the lord only rahab the harlot shall live she and all that are with her in the house because she had hid the messengers that were sent that we sent down to verse verse 20 because the other ones is talking about how the things were to be kept for the lord kept for the levites verse 20 so the people shouted when the priest blew with the trumpets and it came to pass what came to pass came to pass what god said was going to happen when the people heard the sound of the trumpet and the people shouted with a great shout that the wall fell down flat so that the people went up into the city every man straight before him and they took the city now some people might look at that and they say oh that's just a good story that's a good story for us to read for an encouragement it's just that's all it is a story no that's not just a story that's not fiction this morning that is something that actually happened it really happened and it happened exactly the way god said it would happen i don't know how except by god i don't have a way to explain it too many people today get get stuck in this uh in this need of um i need i need to understand how a certain thing happened and if you can't explain it well enough for me to understand how it happened then i can't believe it and it must be false well i'm sorry you can either choose to believe it or not there's so many things in this scripture that i can't go in and prove to you that i can't prove to you that jonah was swallowed by a well but it says it in the bible so i believe that it happened you know i can't prove these things and i don't have to prove these things it stands on its own when somebody comes to you and say well do you have any proof that this happened or that happened no i don't need it i have faith he said it happened so i believe it happened and that's all that matters to me you know in our natural mind we would look at that and say that there's no way that that really could have happened can you imagine could you imagine joshua after receiving this message from from the lord and he comes back to his camp and the lord spoke to him and told him describe to him what what's going to happen and what they need to do so here's joshua going to this group of men that are warriors they're warriors they're ready to fight they've got their swords they're ready to fight and he they come back and they're like did you get a word of the lord yeah got a word of the lord and they're excited they're ready to go we're going to go take this city we're going to take it by force and what did the lord say to us joshua what'd he say to us he said well all right hang on um you might want to sit down i'm going to try to explain to you what he said well we're ready to go we're ready i've got my sword i'm ready to go i can go now let's let's go fight this is what we trained for this is we're ready for this the lord has told us that this is our land and that we can go take it and we're not gonna we're not gonna have any death right you know that's that's where it should have been a can ruined that but that's a different message but he he goes back and sits down with him and says hey i'm going to tell you what now when we go in we're going to go over there and um i don't want y'all to do anything you what leave your shorts sheathed be very quiet don't speak a word and this is what god said he told me now y'all got to believe me he told me that if we'll go over there and we'll walk around the city and just be really quiet and let the priest blow the trumpet then we're going to come back to camp and i can see those men speaking to the other one i think that he's lost his mind something's wrong with joshua and we need to go get it checked out he needs to go see the physician because something's wrong this is not how you fight a battle you don't fight your battle by just going in and walking [Music] but that's what god told him to do but i'm sure he had a tough time convincing them at first and i can just see the guys talking back and forth okay well what are we going to do after that joshua then we're going to go fight right no we're going to do the same thing the next day have you lost your mind we have never heard of anybody trying to overtake a city especially a walled city just by being quiet that makes no sense joshua so okay so on the on the third day we're gonna go in early in the morning while they're still sleeping and we're gonna we're gonna overtake the city right he said no that's not what he told me guys see you see when the when the messenger came to me he gave me specific instructions so if y'all would just if you would sit for just a moment and allow me to express what he told me i'll tell you the fullness of what the messenger said and he this is what he said to me now i want you to do this same thing six days in a row and the only noise is going to be is the priest is going to blow the trumpet but you're going to be quiet and then on the seventh day you men of war are going to walk around the city seven times and the priests are going to blow the trumpet and then you're going to sing wait a minute we're men of war we have singers we have people that play music and you're asking men of war to sing have you heard us sing have you heard us sing joshua i've listened to them they can't carry a tune in a bucket but joshua said that's what god said and no matter how silly it seemed to them they actually believed him enough to do it they believed him enough to follow the instruction that god gave through that prophet to them they did not understand it i guarantee you they did not understand it but they believed it enough to do it and to follow it verbatim exactly the way he said to do it because if they had not followed it exactly they would not have been victorious but they took evidently there had been things in joshua's life before this is the way i look at it i believe that there were enough things in joshua's life that had happened before that they could base off of that and they could say you know what god does speak to joshua and it would really behoove us to listen to that man of god now even when we don't understand it exactly even when we don't see it fully clear played out in front of us but there's something about that man that whenever he comes to us and say hey guys this is what the lord spoke to me yesterday and it happens and he comes to you next week and says this is what the lord spoke to me today and it happens there had been enough of that take place previous to this point i believe that they would have enough faith to follow the commission that was sent through that prophet and that told them this is how we will overcome this is how we will fight our battles and we're not fighting our battles we're going to let let god do it for us and that's what god wanted them to do he wanted them to yield he wanted them to just believe he he wanted them to have faith enough faith in the man of god and the word that was coming from him to just simply believe it and that's what we need to do today it's a simple message it's simply believe the psalm was sung so many times only believe all things are possible if we only believe you know we we read in um read the story of um the wedding at cana and um they come up short on the wine you know come up short on the wine and and they uh they come to jesus and you know they they start telling him you know mary's mary comes to him and says hey they're running little a little short on the wine he's like what do you want me to do about it it's not my time you know what what why why are you troubling me with about about wine why do i need to do anything about that but mary turned to the servants and this is what she said to them whatever he says whatever he says do it that was simple wasn't it yes and so he tells them hey go go fill these pots with water and i'm sure they're thinking water is not going to work i've drunk water all my life and water stays water why are you going to give people water but mary was convincing enough to them to say whatever he says do it now we don't have anything previous to that that i have found that displays miracles that were performed in the scripture that's the first one that i see so how did mary know i believe that there were things that's not written in the scripture that jesus had done in their home in in his life and around her and she had witnessed it enough times to know it may seem foolish it sure did seem foolish to peter whenever jesus tells him hey won't you cast your net on the other side of the boat you know because peter that's what he did for a living he was a fisherman i mean he he knew that sea better than anybody else i'm sure he knew it better than jesus in in the the natural sense that because jesus wasn't a fisherman so jesus goes out there we were we were um we on a fishing trip uh just a couple of weeks ago and we were only about three miles off the coast of uh south carolina north carolina um out there was going to do some uh offshore fishing and so as i'm sitting out there and my dad was with me and um we're just sitting there on the boat and the boat was just kind of it was very calm that day um which was crazy calm the water was just still as it could be even the captain was like we have 0.0 knots of wind there's nothing that's moving out here and we're sitting there and dad looks over to me he says looking out the water he says i wonder if we should cast on the other side he said no wouldn't doesn't that kind of sound silly looking at all of this massive water that we're around that's around that's surrounding us and he says don't you think that seemed a little silly to peter whenever he was sitting there and he'd been fishing all night long on the seat what i think was the sea of galilee that they were on that's that's only that's about what eight miles by 16 miles or something like that that's that's the size of the body of water that's um that's there so i don't know how far off the shore they had went and doing their fishing and um but he's like just just cast it on that side i'm sure peter's thinking do you think we're an idiot do you think we are an idiot you know we've been doing this all night long this is what i've done all my life my my my dad was a fisherman my grandfather was a fisherman this is this is what we do you know we we know how to catch fish and there's just no fish out here but it was a simple peter looked at him and says at thy word it wasn't at peter's understanding it was at peter's acceptance of the word of god and that's what mary was telling them no matter what he says to do just do it brother branham would say in one of the messages i was listening he said that's still a good message today that's still relevant today whatever he says just do it just simply obey there's so much that goes with with obedience if we could just simply obey so look looking back on the on the story we read there of jericho that was each day for six days they would compass the city men of war priests with the trumpets they were ought to remain silent except for the priest they were to blow the trumpets each day and as i look at that i i see a similarity of how we are we're now in the seventh church age there's been six ages before us and in each age the priests have went out and they've blown the trumpet they the the gospel message has went out each age we're in the seventh age so there's something extra that needs to happen in the seventh time that it goes around that's whenever you have the priest blowing the trumpet and you have us men of war that shouts that's where we're at now brother branham said there was a place that he had said that he had um 1962 he had been around the world seven times in 1962. and i i when i when i read that i'm like well that's the seventh day in the seventh church age and the church age messenger that priest went around seven times had already went around so what's left what's left is for us it's our time now and it's our time to shout because the trumpet has been blown and we still have a portion to play we still have a part in this the this great orchestra and our part is to shout exactly to prophesy again it's our turn to shout the problem is today that we um people let too many of their circumstances get in the way of their shout they uh they they keep looking as we said last night they keep looking at their problems rather than looking at their promise they let their situation just stifle their joy and all they see is that big old wall of jericho standing up in front of them and they have forgotten what joshua's told them they've forgotten what the holy ghost has told you that you can stand in front of that wall and you you you raise a shout and that wall is going to come crumbling down and you're going to be able to walk straight forward right across it many times we have we we struggle with with getting past our past i've made mention of that last night our flesh it just continues to remind us of the things that we've done and that's what creates that wall in front of us so many times that um we see our shortcomings we see we see our problems every time we look in a mirror we see who we are in our eyes i'm so thankful he doesn't see me the same way i see me he sees me through his eyes and through the blood we have to look to the unseen this morning this afternoon we've got to look to the to the unseen and look to it by faith and claim our victory if there's a wall of worry that's standing in front of you just shout it down just stand up to it and shout it down if there's a wall of fear that's that's got in front of you shout it down you worship you praise you bring his presence in front of you right there and through that presence you can you can knock the walls down not you're not going to do it he's going to do it but your worship is what's going to bring him on the scene and through your shout you will have your victory through your shout out in 1953 god's provided way the messages at toward the end of the service brother branham is praying and he says lord i pray that in the name of jesus christ that the holy ghost will drive back every gloomy spirit every doubting spirit and may the witness of jesus christ which is now present to prove that he's the same yesterday today and forever break down the walls of the devil doubting ungodly spirit that would move around over here and may every person be healed oh thou devil i charge thee by the son of god jesus christ of nazareth that you turn these people loose come out of them every person may be free them sitting there with arthritis the woman sitting there bound with the power of the devil that woman sitting there losing her mind by menopause every one of you are absolutely healed right now in the name of jesus christ if you'll accept it if you'll accept it and rise to your feet claim your god-given victory this and this is brother branham saying that this is your time to shout this is your time to shout hallelujah and he says in the in the walls of jericho as it was the enemy that's keeping you out will fall to the ground and every power of the devil will be broken in jesus christ's name [Music] if we accept it if we believe it if we take hold of it if we shout that's how we defeat satan that's how we have the victory this morning the victory is in our shout out the victory is here it's in our shout this morning we've already said it once it's not your battle it is not your battle stop thinking that you've got to fight it it ain't yours to begin with our flesh it focuses on the negative things our flesh binds us up and makes us think that it's our battle and i've got to make my way through it i've got to figure out a way to to make it through this no you don't he's our he is your way he is your way whenever he's when he's on on the cross and he says it is finished three words it is finished what was finished everything everything was finished the plan of salvation that he had placed put in place it was finished whatever you have in need of it's already been done it's already been done we just have to accept it we just have to walk into it and receive it and accept it and your healing your victory is already provided to you but sometimes people they they fail a while back there was a um there was a promise given to us through the government brother steve that um if you were eligible that you were going to get a stimulus fund they were going to you were going to get money and i remember whenever that was put out on the news and it was a buzz around word everybody talking about it and everybody's saying that i'm i'm going to do this and i'm going to do that and this is what i'm going to buy and they had already made plans they'd already spent the money before it ever got into their account just because a promise was given to them by the government which you don't always trust the government they'll tell you a lot of things but i saw and i witnessed individuals get so excited so enthused because it's going to get a piece of money and based on that promise to receive they made plans they made plans they already knew what they was going to spend it on i don't know how many promises are in this written word but i can tell you one thing i don't see as many people getting so excited and making plans based on a promise if god gives you a promise he will keep it go ahead and make your plans for it don't say you know well i don't want to i hate hearing people say well i would do such and such but i don't want to get my hopes up i know the lord told me that that he could he could heal me i know the lord told me that he could answer this problem but you know i really don't want to get my hopes up just in case something don't go the way i think it's going to where's your faith i want my hope to be built up i want my hope to be at a level in my faith to be a level that i can receive the promise because if i le if i sit off to the side say well i don't want my hopes to get up too much then all you're going to do is live in the dimension of doubt you're not going to fully receive and accept what god has promised for you because you're not in a position to receive it because in your mind you've already set off to the side you've already doubted it there should be no doubt in our mind at all when god gave you a promise he fully intends to keep it you've got to accept it you've got to be in the position to receive it you are an eligible receiver recipient of every single promise that he has given to you this morning go ahead and make plans go ahead and make plans based on the promise that he gave you amen i believe that there so many people are not seeing victory today they're they're they're defeated all the time it's because of a barrier of unbelief there's a barrier of of doubt and unbelief that that's in their way and they they have a wall of worry that stands up so high and they can't see past that that wall that's standing there that's what is is is dividing them from being in the presence of the lord is is their worries their unbelief brother branham would say in in the message of the unseen 1958 he says oh if the church of this day could ever pray till they pass the sin barrier an unbelief barrier they could shout the victory of a living god when they once pass that barrier by looking to the unseen and letting the world vibrate and do what it wants to don't get your eyes on the world they're going to do their thing it's not important to me what they're going to what they're doing i'm looking to his promise i'm looking to his promise that he has given to me and i'm going to go past i'm breaking past breaking through this the sin barrier the unbelief barrier there's there's turbulence you know they've talked about it whenever a jet tries to breaks the sound barrier that there's turbulence in that jet and there will be turbulence in your life as you're trying to break through the barrier of worry the barrier of unbelief there will be turbulence in there but if you just hold on and you hang on to it and you let him carry you through there is victory on the other side there is freedom on the other side if you can ever break through that wall of worry that's got got you out of the presence of god you can move through that into his presence there is fullness of joy there is happiness there is love and there is peace there is peace so many people today they don't they don't understand peace they don't have peace in their life they're they're struggling they're troubled by all the things of of the world and it's because they have not held on to his promise and they've let go of that and they got their eyes too much on the things of this world and not on god but get your eyes off of the world don't let those things sway you there those things are going to happen around you but we are not a part of this world we're here in this place but we're not a part of that i don't want to be a part of it i want to be as far separated from it as i can i don't want to i don't want to be involved with any of that i want to be truly in his service we've been given a shield of faith not a shield of fear and some people put up a wall of fear and stand behind that but we've been given a shield of faith that we'd be able to move forward in the battle he's given us a victory shout the next time that that satan comes to you and and wants to tell you you know what there is just no way there's no way that you can overcome this trial you can do what you want you can say what you want but there is no way that you can overcome this trial that's what satan is going to tell you and he'll make you believe it if you keep listening to him but whenever he tells you that you uh you remind him of what's said over in second chronicles chapter 20. if you look in chapter 20 verse 13 down through well we'll read maybe down to 22 or so it says and all of judah stood before the lord with their little ones their wives and their children that upon jehaziah the son of zechariah and the son of banaya the son of jail the son of matani and a levite of the sons of asaph came the spirit of the lord in the midst of the congregation and he said hearken ye all judah and ye inhabitants of jerusalem and thou king jehoshaphat thus saith the lord unto you be not afraid nor dismayed by reason that's what gets us many times is our reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but gods you look at satan the next time he comes to you say the battle is not mine it's the lord's he's already overcome he stood he hung on the cross he said it is finished he already overcame it is not my battle i don't need to pick it up he he took care of it for me brother steve all i have to do is just rest rest in the completed work that he has done you know um elijah elijah got tired elijah got went through a period of depression you know he he had the the um experience on mount carmel and god did mighty works and he leaves from there and he runs he goes it goes and you find him under a juniper tree and while he's sitting under the juniper tree he's saying to the lord it's enough you read read what he says he says it is enough just take my life let me let me go just just well if he was really wanting to die why didn't he just stay where he was at jezebel wanted to kill him [Music] he could have just stayed where he was at and she would have done that work for him but you see he he he was in a state of depression he was in a in a state of tiredness and and he he run from that and he was at a place of just saying lord you know why don't you just just take my life it is enough and as i read those scriptures a little while back i read those scriptures where he was saying it is enough i was like there's another place in the scripture that that my mind goes to that something similar and i was thinking of jesus christ when he was on the cross and he didn't say it is enough he said it is finished he wasn't saying you know because if i put it in our lingo what elijah was saying well i've had enough whenever he was saying it is enough his our lingo would would be today god i've had enough of this mess i've had enough of this struggle that i'm in i've had enough of this problem that i'm walking through today and i just i'm giving up i've had enough jesus hung on the cross and he says i am enough [Music] you may say i've had enough and jesus looks at you he says look to me because i am enough i am enough i have whatever you have need of this morning thank you god i am enough and i've already finished the work all you have to do is receive it and give him praise and shout and give him thanks and give him worship and give him adoration for all the things that he has already given to you there should be no struggle from you because the struggle is over because he has already completed the work let me try to wind up this morning we're going to wind up or wind down don't defense the the right word in over in um oh later in that scripture i didn't never did finish reading the scripture in oh my my well yeah with second chronicles i'm trying to see which which verse that that said about the ambushments and i thought that was there it is 22. okay yeah on why i was thinking 20 but it was 22. and it says and when they begin to sing and to praise the lord set ambushments against the children of ammon moab and mount saiyar which were come against judah and they were smitten the lord sent the ambushments when they praised when they sang when they worshiped when they began to sing the lord released the ambushments against the enemy and all they had to do was sing just sing what we were doing this morning just singing just worshipping him and he comes down and he sets the ambush against the enemy and he takes care of the battle that you have this morning there there's a pattern that i'm i'm hoping that you're seeing this this afternoon that that when we begin to give him our worship when we begin to give him our adoration that he comes on the scene and he performs a work that you cannot do he performs a work that we cannot do at all and he it's his battle and he says i'll take care of it if you will just let me all i want you to do is praise me for it i want to hear you your worship i want you to enter into praise and i've taken care of it if you look over in in paul and silas and i'll try to finish up if i can with this this morning again my my clocks and y'all's clocks are different things and that gets confusing to me and and um i had no idea last night that it went so long and i please forgive me for that i no intention to do that but i tell you i was just having a good time in the lord and and y'all were having a good time with me so i didn't want to leave so in the book of acts chapter 16 verses 25 through 31 it says and at midnight paul and silas pray odd time to pray right at midnight they didn't have nothing else to do they're sitting there in the jail and they're they're in stocks and bonds and they said they prayed and they sang praises unto god and the prisoners heard them now what's important about the prisoners hearing them because if you understood the types of prisons that they had in the jails that they would have been put in there their their rock it was places that was hewn out of out of rock and so they would put them into these places and the sound doesn't carry in those places so it tells me they were being loud because the other prisoners heard them and suddenly there was a great earthquake i believe there was an earthquake here this morning so that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were open and everyone's bands not just theirs everyone's bands were loosed [Applause] their worship brought freedom to those that was around them their worship set other people free glory to god too many times we sit down and we're we're we're just concentrating on ourself and and i'm concerned about me and i'm going to worship for me but your worship can set other people free your disobedience can bind them up just the same your disobedience in in not worshipping can cause people to not get their healing i've heard brother branham say that your disobedience and your non-participation can you stubbornness thank you that's the right word the stubbornness can cause other people to to miss their healing to continue to be bound i don't want that on me this morning at all so he said they were all everyone's bands were loosed and the keeper of the prison the jailer the keeper of the prison awakening out of his sleep he was he was just all out of sorts waking up out of his sleep and seeing the prison doors open he drew out his sword and would have killed himself supposing that the prisoners had been fled but paul wasn't going to let that happen paul cried out with a loud voice saying do thyself no harm for we are all here then he called for a light they didn't have a light in there but he recognized by the commotion that was going on that that i think the lord just showed him that the prison guard was getting ready to kill himself because they didn't have a light he called for a light and sprang in and came trembling this is the prison guard and fell down before paul and silas and then he brought them out and said sirs what must i do to be saved what must i do to be saved he's talking to prisoners asking a prisoner what must i do to be saved and they said believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved but he didn't stop there he didn't stop just with him if you believe you can be saved in the house he didn't leave it for just that one glory hallelujah praise your name lord jesus glory be to god the house your family your children their children their children their children and their children own and on and on because he believed i believe i see a group of believers here this morning hallelujah a group of believers that we believe on the name of the lord jesus christ hallelujah could the musicians come this morning it says they began to sing in praise it was loud enough to others for others to hear it i would just love it i'd love to know what they say i wish i knew what songs they sang brother steve so i can only imagine in my mind what they may have sung you know because they read they read the old testament scriptures you know i believe that maybe when paul and silas was sitting there and maybe paul looked over at silas and said you know i was reading the other day silas and in isaiah and isaiah said they that wait upon the lord we're here in this prison there's nothing else that we can do but wait can you give me the key of g this morning we'll try in the key of [Music] that g upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up [Music] oh they shall walk in not faith teach me lord teach me lord [Music] maybe silas looked over at paul and said you know the psalmist david said it this way the lord he is my shepherd i shall not won't he maketh me to lie down in green pastures [Music] he restored my soul and he made me whole teach me lord teach me lord to wait oh they that way upon the lord will shall renew their strength they shall mount glory to god with wings as he glows they shall run and not be weary oh they shall not faint teach me lord teach me lord to wait as i continue to think of their conversation that they must have had that that evening and singing together and praising me or maybe maybe silas looks over at paul and says you know paul the reason that we're in this prison is because we just can't shut up we can't keep our mouth shut of what god is doing and i think maybe he looked over and that it and said a little a little bit peppier this morning well he's done so much for me that i cannot tell it all who i cannot tell it all but i cannot tell it all oh he's done so much for me that i cannot tell it all he has taken my sins away well he's done so much for me that i cannot tell it all who i cannot tell it all i cannot tell at all he's done so much for me that i cannot tell it all he has taken my sins away well he gave me victory and i cannot tell it all i cannot tell at all but i cannot tell it all jesus gave me victory and i cannot tell it all he has taken my sins away oh he's done so much for me that i cannot tell it all i cannot tell it all i cannot tell it all oh he's done so much for me that i cannot tell it all he has taken my sins [Music] hallelujah hallelujah i believe their praise got loud i believe their worship was loud i believe that paul looked over maybe he looked at silas he says i said i wasn't gonna tell nobody but i can't keep it to myself i can't keep it to myself i can't keep it to myself well i said i wasn't gonna tell nobody but i can't keep it to myself of what the lord has done for me oh you all have been there when he saved my soul oh you all have been there when he put my name on the road well i started walking i started talking i started singing and i started shouting what the lord had done for me oh you all have been there when he saved my soul you all have been there when he met me on damascus road well i started walking i started talking i started singing and i started shouting what the lord had done for me well i said i wasn't gonna tell nobody but i to myself oh i can't keep it to myself be myself well i said i wasn't gonna tell nobody but i to myself for what the lord had done for me oh you all have been there we saved my soul oh you won't have been there when you put my name on the road well i started walking i started talking i started singing and i started shouting what the lord had done for me [Music] gloria i believe when those walls came down they looked at each other and they said oh victory is mine oh victory is my victory today is i told satan just get deeply high for victory today is mine [Music] when i woke this morning i didn't have no doubt before i knew that the lord was gonna bring me out well i got down on my knees i said lord help me please [Music] victory is my victory today yes [Music] is my his joy is my joy today is [Music] [Music] joy is my joy is my joy today is my well thou i told satan oh man get thee behind joy today play it one time while we pray [Music] oh victoria's my victory is my victory today is [Music] victory today is my [Music] hallelujah thank god for the victory [Music] isn't he wonderful isn't he worthy to be praised you know uh sometimes when you get in an atmosphere especially people who are not used to that atmosphere they can become very nervous and emotional and they may not understand what's happening to them they may even feel like they're afraid during our camp meeting there was a woman that come in here that i had not seen in years and she should have been she has experienced the presence of the lord many times before but she was so nervous her whole body was just trembling and her granddaughter was afraid for her because she didn't understand what was happening and this happens sometime and we don't know what's happening to us or we we may see someone like that and we don't know what's happening to them but this is somehow sometimes the way that we respond just play something this is the way that that we respond to the presence of the lord when we're not used to feeling that presence some people don't know what it is how many of you are glad you recognize his presence but i want to pray for you right now just from here but i want to pray for you maybe you're streaming the service you're not used to feeling then and and it it just disturbs your your uh you know you're feeling a little bit well i want you to know that will not hurt you that presence of the lord will not hurt you it'll change your life forever more if you'll let him he didn't come to make us afraid he comes to let us know he's real and sometimes that tug what that is is a tug on the other end of the line to let you know god is there and he can make himself real to you i want god to do that for all of you that may have been in that place this morning so would you just bow your head with me a moment father we have experienced your wonderful presence here and we recognize that there may be those among us who are not used to feeling that are seeing such a display and a demonstration of joy and victory and it may set their system just a little little out of sorts but i ask you lord to draw each one into a closer relationship with you let each one know that you are real and that that doesn't happen to cause them to fear or to reject it happens to draw them in and to let them know that this is more than just a mental concept but it is a reality having a relationship with you lord is more than just a place to go on sunday it's a daily relationship so i ask you right now lord for every person under the sound of my voice who has not really surrendered to you will you give them grace to say yes will you give them grace to invite you into their life that you might save them from the awful guilt of sin and let them experience a new birth they've been born of the earth lord i pray that they can also be born of heaven born by the spirit we also pray as we come to the close of this youth meeting this weekend that you will come by the holy spirit and seal in everything you have done for us i believe lord that even parents and chaperones and those who help to cook and prepare i believe we've all experienced the reality of who you are in these meetings seal it in holy ghost seal it in as we leave this place today may we find courage not to allow the enemy to talk us out of anything that you have done for us lord our hope is in you our trust
