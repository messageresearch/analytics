[0:00] in pandemics like this pandemic all to
[0:04] be found in him
[0:06] [Music]
[0:10] and many of us are still living way
[0:14] beneath our privileges and we're living
[0:18] way beneath our Authority there's no
[0:20] doubt about it he has all the power we
[0:22] need and he has given us authority to
[0:25] execute and to appropriate that power in
[0:28] the last days there's never been of
[0:31] people like the bride of Jesus Christ
[0:33] and who she's created to be in the last
[0:35] hour because she will not only operate
[0:38] in the power of Jesus Christ
[0:40] but in the in the authority of Jesus
[0:42] Christ and I want you to know something
[0:44] you don't need as much power if you've
[0:47] got more authority but God's been good
[0:49] to us because jesus said I give you
[0:52] power over all powers how much power
[0:56] does a believer have I don't know how to
[0:59] measure it
[1:00] but I know this the believer has power
[1:03] over all the powers of the enemy so
[1:07] anything you've seen the devil do you
[1:10] carry power that is greater than what
[1:13] the enemy can do and you carry authority
[1:16] to execute that power then why don't we
[1:19] see that in our lives because we're not
[1:21] picking it up because we got so much
[1:24] else in our hands how many of you know
[1:27] there comes a time to lay everything
[1:28] down and just say I gotta take up what I
[1:31] need to get by it's such an hour as this
[1:34] in moments like this in days like these
[1:38] in hours like these hours in pandemics
[1:43] like this pandemic o to be found in him
[1:47] to know that his resurrection power is
[1:51] working on the inside hallelujah
[1:55] how do we know that the life of Jesus
[1:59] Christ is actively operating on the
[2:02] inside of us we know it by faith we take
[2:07] it by faith we accept it by faith but we
[2:11] discern it by our desires our choices
[2:17] are based on our desires and someone can
[2:22] tell you all day long I don't want that
[2:24] that's not what I'm actively pursuing
[2:27] and yet their choices will testify of
[2:32] what their desires really are the proof
[2:37] is in the pudding isn't it if you really
[2:42] have something working on the inside of
[2:45] the inside it begins to shape and mold
[2:50] your desires and therefore it begins to
[2:55] have authority over your choices
