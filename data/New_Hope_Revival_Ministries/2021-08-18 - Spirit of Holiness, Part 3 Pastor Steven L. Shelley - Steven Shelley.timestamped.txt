[24:02] amen god bless you tonight
[24:06] we want to welcome you to our tuesday
[24:08] night service
[24:10] and we are once again
[24:12] stream only as we have been for the last
[24:15] few weeks
[24:16] we had an outbreak of the virus in our
[24:19] church community and
[24:21] many people were fighting it at one time
[24:23] and we wanted to do everything that we
[24:26] could to reduce the spread and
[24:29] uh i don't know how successful we were
[24:31] with that but i know that god is
[24:34] bringing each one through by his grace
[24:38] and thank you for your prayers for one
[24:40] another in our local church body and
[24:43] thank those of you who are streamers
[24:46] with us and you've been watching the
[24:48] services and you have sent
[24:50] many many many notes to say i'm praying
[24:54] for your church family i'm praying for
[24:57] your congregation
[24:58] and we know that god is certainly using
[25:02] those prayers to lift us to higher
[25:04] places
[25:06] and we're so thankful for that and we're
[25:09] going to go to the lord in prayer but i
[25:11] just wanted to let you know that you are
[25:13] welcome we're glad that you've taken a
[25:15] few moments of your life to join with us
[25:18] in this service tonight
[25:20] and uh i want to make sure that you know
[25:24] that
[25:24] we are doing our best to keep in touch
[25:27] my wife is doing a really good job
[25:29] helping me to stay in touch with the
[25:32] different ones and we see god moving we
[25:36] see that the lord is bringing them
[25:37] through and it hasn't been as quickly as
[25:39] we would have liked to have seen it but
[25:42] we nonetheless rejoice and give glory
[25:44] and honor to god
[25:46] i was able to see sister elfrida today
[25:49] in her automobile and she stopped and
[25:51] spoke a moment and and was testifying to
[25:54] me of how the lord has moved for her
[25:57] helped her and i think i mentioned i was
[26:00] able to see sister jeffrey the other day
[26:02] and god has certainly strengthened her
[26:05] and each one that has still been
[26:07] battling we've been getting reports that
[26:10] in most cases they're getting stronger
[26:13] every day
[26:14] and uh fevering less
[26:17] symptoms are going down
[26:19] some are out of quarantine and back to
[26:21] work but i think overall most people
[26:24] would tell you that there's weakness
[26:26] they're weak and they they need their
[26:28] strength to be renewed and you know i
[26:30] believe that's it's not just a physical
[26:32] strength but there's a spiritual
[26:34] strength and we're going to believe the
[26:36] lord so we want to go to the lord in
[26:38] prayer
[26:39] and we know that everybody is not
[26:42] fighting the virus but you have needs
[26:44] and you have problems and you have
[26:47] situations that you need the lord to
[26:49] move on your behalf and we're going to
[26:52] stand with you tonight in faith and
[26:54] we're going to believe that god will
[26:56] move there were several requests that
[26:58] came in
[26:59] uh on the stream on sunday and i was
[27:02] already praying over them sunday evening
[27:05] and monday and again today
[27:07] lifting up families so many of our
[27:10] families out there
[27:12] there the saints have burdened for their
[27:14] families and they want to see them
[27:16] serving the lord
[27:19] we also want to ask you to pray for
[27:22] sister flo's daughter-in-law
[27:25] pam hendrix

[27:38] garvis's wife and she is
[27:41] in the hospital and uh they were having
[27:44] some problems with her
[27:46] and keeping the mask on and so forth and
[27:49] so it looked like they were going to be
[27:51] putting her on a ventilator this evening
[27:54] but we're asking the lord to work a
[27:56] miracle in her life
[27:58] we know that god is more than able we
[28:02] want you to lift up more rains to the
[28:05] lord that god would help her she's been
[28:07] fighting sister weems has been fighting
[28:10] something in her body and needs a touch
[28:13] from the lord we just need a lot of
[28:15] healing but you know he's he's on the
[28:18] case
[28:19] and we want to give god praise for what
[28:21] he has done and you know if we didn't
[28:24] believe god could do it we wouldn't
[28:25] bother bringing it to him but he has
[28:28] told us i want you to sing with me as we
[28:30] get ready to pray faith in god can move

[30:20] it's faith in god that cools a fevered
[30:24] brow
[30:25] it's faith in god that can smite a

[31:00] every one in this congregation and out
[31:03] there across the world who are fighting
[31:06] the virus lord we know that you're the
[31:10] one that's standing with your people
[31:12] bringing them through
[31:14] maybe it seemed like moment by moment or
[31:17] minute by minute but lord i thank you
[31:21] that victory has come every day we're
[31:24] hearing
[31:25] many testify that i'm coming a little
[31:28] closer i'm almost out of it now i see
[31:33] the victory in sight and so lord we
[31:36] don't want to let up in our praying we

[31:43] than able and so we just lift them up
[31:45] lord i pray for every streamer right now
[31:48] those who are not a part of the local
[31:50] community of faith but they are
[31:52] believers out there across the world
[31:54] they may not be seeing this live they
[31:57] may watch it at another time but lord
[31:59] you got all that in your great big mind
[32:02] you know their need lord you know
[32:04] exactly what they need and what they
[32:07] will have need of so we join our faith

[32:30] make a way where there was no way we
[32:33] heard your word nothing is impossible
[32:36] with you and so lord with men things are
[32:39] possible even sometimes the doctors or a
[32:42] lawyer or some judge would do everything
[32:45] within their power to help but they're
[32:47] limited in power but i want to thank you
[32:50] lord you know no limits there are no
[32:53] restraints as long as we can only
[32:56] believe
[32:57] you are free lord to do what you desire
[33:00] to do in our lives we ask you to bless
[33:03] our time in your word in a few moments
[33:06] let us gain strength from being in your
[33:09] presence and sitting under your word
[33:12] lord it has happened that way so many
[33:14] times in our lives we ask for this help
[33:17] in the mighty name of the lord jesus
[33:20] christ and for his glory we say amen
[33:24] and the church says
[33:27] amen so be it we agree
[33:31] so we want to mention to you tonight
[33:34] we unless you
[33:36] local believers should hear from us
[33:39] between now and then uh our plan is to
[33:44] gather in person on sunday morning at 11
[33:48] o'clock here in the sanctuary
[33:51] uh if you are not able if you are
[33:54] perhaps still in quarantine if you still
[33:57] have a fever if you are still fighting
[34:00] symptoms that would hinder you or
[34:02] prevent you or prevent others then we
[34:05] certainly understand that there will be
[34:07] some who will be streaming but uh if you
[34:10] have already come through it and it's
[34:12] behind you
[34:13] and you're out of quarantine and you
[34:16] want to gather
[34:18] then you know if there's just eight or
[34:20] ten of us uh then that'll be fine we'll
[34:23] still be
[34:24] ministering to those who are at home but
[34:27] i don't know about you but i need to see
[34:29] i need to see the body
[34:31] and uh this is one opportunity for us to
[34:34] do that we don't want to endanger anyone
[34:37] that is not what we're trying to do
[34:39] we're just trying to say okay lord
[34:42] you're bringing us through some have
[34:43] come through with victory they're back
[34:45] at work
[34:46] and we might as well gather together in
[34:48] your name on sunday morning at 11
[34:50] o'clock now if anything should change if
[34:54] there should be a new case or something
[34:56] like that we would let you know and we
[34:59] would go back to stream only we're going
[35:01] to be faithful by the grace of god to do
[35:04] what we can to be a blessing during this
[35:07] time but if possible it sure would be
[35:10] good to have a live amen and a nod and a
[35:15] smile and know that we are together we
[35:18] just need that sometime when we've been
[35:20] through something as a body and you may
[35:22] have even felt like you were going
[35:24] through it alone but i want you to know
[35:26] you were not there were others in the
[35:28] fight there were others in this church
[35:31] community believing god to bring you
[35:33] through and we ought to come with a
[35:34] celebration because i've had several
[35:37] testify to me of miracles they believe
[35:40] miracles have taken place in their body
[35:43] and in their life and we want to give
[35:44] god all the glory for that i think that
[35:48] will do for the music tonight i
[35:50] appreciate the help that we have had
[35:52] appreciate sister laurel being here and
[35:55] brother josh being here and benjamin

[36:06] brother hawk is behind the sound board
[36:08] and the stream board and i just couldn't
[36:11] do this i couldn't do it without their
[36:13] help and i know that you've been praying
[36:15] for me i know you've been praying for
[36:18] them and we appreciate it i'm telling
[36:20] you we really do appreciate you standing
[36:23] with us
[36:24] we want to go to the word tonight
[36:27] and uh we don't have to be a long time
[36:29] together in the word we want you to rest
[36:33] we want those who are still
[36:35] dealing with some stuff we want you to
[36:38] have rest we want you to get strong

[36:44] tell you to eat you that are still
[36:47] fighting eat something eat anything
[36:50] and somebody said well i can't smell it
[36:52] and i can't taste it i don't care if you
[36:54] can smell it or taste it or not eat it
[36:56] anyway
[36:57] especially if it's healthy because you
[36:59] need that strength and whatever you do
[37:02] drink water drink water drink water
[37:04] drink water these are things that you
[37:06] can do to help some of the weakness and
[37:09] start getting some movement in if it's
[37:11] just you know one sister told me who's
[37:13] come through it with victory she said i
[37:15] made myself i didn't have i i made my
[37:19] own food
[37:20] i washed my own clothes and and she said
[37:23] i wasn't hungry but i ate anyway i knew
[37:25] that i had to and i walked up and down
[37:28] and got exercise and sat on the porch in
[37:30] the sun and and did things like that to
[37:33] help myself and you know she has gotten
[37:36] the victory and so do what you can to
[37:39] get your strength back
[37:41] and just know that we love you and just
[37:43] know that we're thankful that god is
[37:45] helping you
[37:46] and be encouraged be encouraged because
[37:50] i believe that these things are upon us
[37:53] for a reason and we're just putting our
[37:56] eyes on jesus and going on
[37:58] tonight we will take a little lesson in
[38:01] the spirit of holiness we have been
[38:04] preaching on that now
[38:06] for a couple services and we'll need to
[38:09] get in one and maybe maybe two more on
[38:12] the spirit of holiness before we move on
[38:15] we are talking about the seven offices
[38:18] of the holy ghost
[38:19] i say just about every time i introduce
[38:22] a service that
[38:23] i don't know if that's the right
[38:25] terminology we could say ministries or
[38:28] administrations but i know that there
[38:31] are at least seven
[38:33] uh mentioned in the bible
[38:36] and uh for those of you that may be
[38:37] joining us for the first time we spoke
[38:40] about the spirit of life the spirit of
[38:42] truth the spirit of adoption and now
[38:45] we're on the spirit of holiness we'll go
[38:48] to the spirit of grace the spirit of
[38:50] supplication and the spirit of glory all
[38:53] mentioned in the bible and if you are
[38:55] not with us
[38:57] the last two services you can read the
[38:59] specific term of the spirit of holiness
[39:02] in romans chapter 1 verse 3 and 4 but
[39:06] we're not going to read that in the
[39:08] service tonight now we started on sunday
[39:12] in matthew chapter 23 verses 2 through 6
[39:17] and i would like to read that again
[39:19] and then i'm going to read in two other
[39:21] places
[39:22] in in the book of matthew where jesus is
[39:26] dealing with religion
[39:29] and in verse 2
[39:31] saying the scribes and the pharisees sit
[39:34] in moses seat it's a seat of authority
[39:38] and judgment
[39:40] all therefore whatsoever they bid you
[39:43] observe that observe and do
[39:45] but do not ye after their works for they
[39:49] say
[39:50] and do not now we call that hypocrisy
[39:55] and
[39:56] but i love the way that jesus honored
[39:59] them
[40:00] for their determination to observe the
[40:03] truth to stand by the instructions that
[40:07] god gave to moses and yet he said while
[40:10] you're observing what they say
[40:12] do not do as they do
[40:15] in other words you follow their words
[40:18] but don't look at their actions as an
[40:20] example for they say something and they
[40:24] do not what they say
[40:26] verse 4 for they bind heavy burdens and
[40:29] grievous to be born and lay them on
[40:32] men's shoulders but they themselves will
[40:35] not move them with one of their fingers
[40:37] but all their works they do for to be
[40:40] seen of men
[40:42] i just want you to know that holiness
[40:45] and the spirit of holiness is not to
[40:48] bring you into a place where you do what
[40:51] you do to be seen of men as in pride we
[40:56] do
[40:57] understand that man looks on the outward
[41:00] appearance god sees the heart that means
[41:03] that the outward appearance is a
[41:05] testimony
[41:06] and so we do understand that we are to
[41:10] be separate and we are to sanctify
[41:12] ourselves but we're not doing what we do
[41:17] so that everyone can see our religious
[41:20] trappings and say oh there goes a holy
[41:23] man there goes a holy woman but we want
[41:26] to show them the character of jesus
[41:29] christ and i'm telling you that the
[41:31] spirit of holiness
[41:33] by the holy ghost operating in our life
[41:37] is bringing us into that place where we
[41:40] are yielding our lives more and more to
[41:44] the character of jesus christ he's not
[41:47] only going to have a bride that operates
[41:50] in his power and his authority but he's
[41:53] going to have a bride that operates in
[41:55] her character can in his character can
[41:58] you say amen and so it's not just about
[42:01] sharing power and authority but it's
[42:03] also about sharing his character but all
[42:06] their works they do for to be seen of
[42:09] men they make broad their phylacteries
[42:12] and enlarge the borders of their
[42:14] garments and love the uppermost seats or
[42:18] rooms that feast and the chief's seats
[42:20] in the synagogues in other words they
[42:23] have become puffed up in their outward
[42:26] trappings and i'm telling you that is
[42:29] not the spirit of holiness this is not
[42:32] true holiness
[42:35] this is what we end up producing when we
[42:38] try to make ourselves holy when we try
[42:41] to work our way into being holy true
[42:46] holiness does not work from the outside
[42:49] in you can clean up the out outside of
[42:53] the sepulchre but if inside you're still
[42:57] filled with dead men's bones then it's
[43:00] hypocrisy and we'll find that jesus goes
[43:03] on to deal with that same spirit among
[43:06] the scribes and the pharisees of his day
[43:10] in fact let me read now in matthew
[43:12] chapter 15.
[43:15] this is going to be a little longer
[43:16] reading 20 verses
[43:18] but i want to read this because again
[43:21] jesus is dealing with the scribes and
[43:24] the pharisees
[43:25] then came jesus
[43:27] described
[43:29] excuse me then came to jesus scribes and
[43:32] pharisees which were of jerusalem saying
[43:35] why do thy disciples transgress the
[43:39] tradition of the elders for they wash
[43:42] not their hands when they eat bread and
[43:46] this was a reasonable question
[43:48] but he answered and said unto them
[43:53] why
[43:54] do ye also transgress the commandments
[43:57] of god
[43:59] by your tradition now hold it there just
[44:02] a moment the scribes and the pharisees
[44:04] came to jesus and they asked him why do
[44:07] your disciples transgress the tradition
[44:10] of the elders
[44:12] and jesus answers a question with a
[44:16] question and that's a good way to be he
[44:18] said why do ye also transgress the
[44:21] commandments of god by your traditions
[44:26] you're taking on traditions that
[44:29] actually transgress
[44:31] the commandment the instruction of god
[44:34] he put it right back on them
[44:37] and he said for god commanded saying
[44:40] honor thy father and mother and he that
[44:43] curseth father or mother let him die the
[44:46] death that's a commandment that's not a
[44:48] tradition and then he goes on but ye say
[44:51] whosoever shall say to his father or his
[44:54] mother it is a gift by whatsoever thou
[44:57] mightest be profited by me
[45:01] we're still reading on an honor not his
[45:03] father or his mother
[45:05] he shall be free
[45:07] thus have you made the commandment of
[45:09] god of none effect by your tradition in
[45:14] other words your hypocrisy and here he
[45:16] goes on ye hypocrites
[45:19] why did isaias prophesy of you saying
[45:24] this people draweth nigh unto me with
[45:28] their mouth and honoreth me with their
[45:31] lips but their heart is far from me i
[45:35] don't know about you
[45:37] but that grips me
[45:39] it does it speaks to me
[45:42] it causes me to want to search my own
[45:45] heart
[45:46] because we can know the right lingo we
[45:49] can have the right vocabulary
[45:51] we can know the right talk and the right
[45:54] language but jesus said you're being
[45:57] hypocrite you're drawing nigh to me
[46:00] making all of these professions with
[46:02] your mouth honoring me with your lips
[46:05] but you have not placed your heart in my
[46:08] hands
[46:09] you have retained your heart you have
[46:13] held it back from me in other words
[46:15] jesus is saying you've not allowed me to
[46:18] walk through those deep and dark
[46:21] hallways and canyons of your own heart i
[46:25] want to deal with you and cleanse you
[46:28] from the inside out but you're not
[46:31] yielding to that cleansing because
[46:33] you're focusing only on the outward form
[46:37] you're focusing only in keeping your
[46:39] father's traditions but you're missing
[46:42] the point your tradition is not higher
[46:46] than the commandment it's better that
[46:48] you stand with the commandment of the
[46:51] lord and if your tradition is something
[46:54] not contrary to his commandment then
[46:57] hold on to that as well but if if your
[47:00] tradition causes you to transgress the
[47:04] commandment the truth the instruction
[47:06] then you've got to do some adjusting
[47:08] here where does that adjusting take
[47:10] place not in the garment in the costume
[47:12] or in the outward form it takes place in
[47:16] those deep places of the heart
[47:20] when i was just a boy they used to sing
[47:22] a song about the heart
[47:25] and it was a nice song
[47:27] i'll never forget i hadn't heard it in
[47:30] years and brother carpenter's church
[47:32] from mesa arizona came here and visited
[47:35] us with a big busload of young people
[47:37] many years ago and the youth choir sung
[47:40] that song and it was an invitation that
[47:43] jesus should walk through the avenues of
[47:47] my heart and sometimes he he may come to
[47:50] a door and i don't remember the the
[47:53] lyrics of the song but the theme of the
[47:56] song was he might come to a door and i
[47:58] might not want him i might want to
[48:01] protect myself i might want to keep
[48:04] something from him some secret that i'm
[48:07] not ready for him to deal with but he's
[48:10] not there to destroy he's there to
[48:13] lovingly help me to walk through those
[48:15] places to expose in love and light the
[48:20] things that i have tried to hide from
[48:21] him and i want you to know if you hide
[48:24] your sin if you hide even the pain and
[48:27] don't give it to him and allow him if
[48:30] you hide the rejection instead of just
[48:32] saying lord i'm dealing with this then
[48:34] you you suffer a whole lot longer than
[48:36] you have to so let's not do that let's
[48:40] allow him to come and do some work on
[48:43] the inside focus on that a little while
[48:46] and then the overflow hallelujah that
[48:49] beautiful overflow of inward holiness is
[48:52] going to affect us on the outside and
[48:55] not only us it's going to affect those
[48:57] around us there's no doubt about it now
[48:59] he goes on in verse 9 but in vain they
[49:03] do worship me
[49:05] teaching for doctrines
[49:08] the commandments of men
[49:11] so they have not only
[49:13] replaced the commandments of god
[49:16] with tradition
[49:17] but now they're replacing that with
[49:21] teaching the commandments of men
[49:23] and
[49:24] oral traditions and and all of these
[49:27] different opinions and ideas and he
[49:30] called the multitude and said unto them
[49:32] hear
[49:33] and understand i want you to know he's
[49:35] getting serious here verse 11
[49:38] not that which goeth into the mouth
[49:40] defileth a man but that which cometh out
[49:44] of the mouth this defileth a man again
[49:48] jesus is putting the emphasis on the
[49:50] inside and what works its way to the
[49:53] surface
[49:54] he's putting greater importance and
[49:58] greater significance why because he
[50:01] knows that this is where true holiness
[50:04] comes from it comes by yielding our
[50:07] inner will
[50:08] our mind our will and our emotions and
[50:12] allowing the holy ghost to direct our
[50:14] thoughts to direct our choices to direct
[50:17] our decisions
[50:19] he said it's not that which goeth into
[50:21] the mouth that defiled the man but that
[50:23] which cometh out of the mouth this
[50:25] defileth a man now verse 12
[50:29] then came his disciples and said unto
[50:32] him knowest thou that the pharisees were
[50:35] offended after they heard this saying
[50:38] but he answered and said every plant
[50:41] which my heavenly father hath not
[50:43] planted shall be rooted up he wasn't
[50:46] moved because of their offense he said
[50:49] let them alone
[50:51] they be blind leaders of the blind and
[50:55] if the blind lead the blind both shall
[50:58] fall into the ditch
[51:01] jesus was saying
[51:02] you you see the hypocrisy in their life
[51:05] and the critical spirit that surrounds
[51:08] them you'll never be able to bring peace
[51:11] you'll never be able to talk them out of
[51:13] their offense you'll just have to walk
[51:15] off and leave them alone let the blind
[51:18] lead the blind they'll both fall in the
[51:20] ditch i don't believe he was forsaking
[51:22] them all as though they had no hope he
[51:24] was just saying nothing good is going to
[51:27] come out of trying to argue with this
[51:29] kind of a spirit and then answered peter
[51:32] and said unto him declare unto us this
[51:35] parable
[51:36] and jesus said are ye also yet without
[51:40] understanding
[51:42] i know they don't understand but are you
[51:44] also
[51:45] not understanding do you not ye yet
[51:49] understand that whatsoever entereth in
[51:51] at the mouth goeth into the belly and is
[51:54] cast out into the drought
[51:56] or into the drought but those things
[51:59] which proceeded out of the mouth come
[52:02] forth from the heart and they defile the
[52:06] man
[52:07] and so even more importantly than what
[52:10] you eat
[52:11] that goes into the belly that is passed
[52:14] off through the digestive system even
[52:16] more important than watching what you
[52:19] eat
[52:20] jesus is saying it's important to go to
[52:23] the heart of the matter the matter of
[52:25] the heart to go right to the inside to
[52:28] the intention
[52:29] because out of that heart the bible
[52:32] tells us out of the abundance of the
[52:35] heart the mouth speaketh for out of the
[52:38] heart proceed evil thoughts murders
[52:41] adulteries fornications thefts false
[52:44] witness blasphemies
[52:47] these are the things which defile a man
[52:50] but to eat with unwashing hands defileth
[52:54] not a man
[52:55] now you're in other words you're taking
[52:58] the tradition of the rabbis
[53:00] you are putting that in greater
[53:02] importance
[53:04] you are putting that in a higher
[53:06] position a higher priority than you are
[53:10] by guarding your heart because out of
[53:13] the heart call comes
[53:16] remember that all these things start in
[53:18] the thoughts
[53:20] a man doesn't just go out and commit
[53:22] fornication it's a thought process
[53:24] there's a thought process to committing
[53:27] adultery and thefts and bearing false
[53:30] witness and committing blasphemies it
[53:32] comes from the thoughts which which come
[53:35] from the heart and he goes on and says
[53:37] these are the things which to follow man
[53:40] it seems to me like the scribes and the
[53:43] pharisees wanted to keep people busy
[53:46] with what is on the external and what is
[53:49] and there are a lot of people who focus
[53:51] their whole
[53:52] seems like their whole theme of life
[53:55] is to work on the outside and and that's
[53:58] a good thing to want to behave right
[54:01] live right and do right
[54:04] dress right and be modest and have a
[54:06] good character these are very very
[54:08] important but they don't come from
[54:10] trying to like a leopard trying to
[54:12] change his spots or somebody trying to
[54:15] add a cubit to their stature by giving
[54:18] it a whole lot of thought no that's not
[54:20] the way these things come they come by
[54:23] an inner cleansing they come oh yes by
[54:26] sanctifying they come by the spirit of
[54:30] holiness that works on the inside helps
[54:33] us deal with all these thoughts and
[54:35] temptations that brings us into a place
[54:38] where we could just say yes lord i just
[54:40] want to be like you i just want you to
[54:43] flow out of my life now will you look
[54:46] with me to matthew 12 we're not going to
[54:49] spend too much time here but would you
[54:52] go to matthew 12 i want to read verse 33
[54:55] to 37 it's again red letter jesus is
[54:59] still trying to
[55:01] to set the record straight and he said
[55:04] either make the tree good
[55:07] and his fruit good
[55:09] or else make the tree corrupt and his
[55:12] fruit corrupt for the tree is known by
[55:16] his fruit
[55:18] so a good tree is known to be a good
[55:20] tree because it bears good fruit
[55:23] and the corrupt tree is known to be that
[55:26] because of rotten fruit or corrupt fruit
[55:29] or fruit that is not good oh
[55:32] generation of vipers how can ye being
[55:36] evil speak good things for out of the
[55:39] abundance of the heart the mouth
[55:42] speaketh this is serious business he
[55:45] said a good man out of the good treasure
[55:48] of the heart bringeth forth good things
[55:51] and an evil man out of the evil treasure
[55:54] bringeth forth evil things but i say
[55:57] unto you listen
[55:59] that every idle word that men shall
[56:03] speak
[56:04] they shall give a count thereof in the
[56:08] day of judgment
[56:10] it's so much more
[56:12] than eating the wrong thing
[56:15] it's so much more than that
[56:18] jesus is saying every idle word
[56:21] it's not the it's not the
[56:23] the
[56:24] enlarged border
[56:26] it's it's not
[56:28] the phylactery
[56:31] all of these things
[56:32] may be just fine
[56:35] but that is not how we walk as children
[56:38] of god sons of god
[56:41] this is a process that takes place from
[56:44] the inside out
[56:46] jesus said then in verse 37 for by thy
[56:49] words thou shalt be justified
[56:53] and by thy words thou shalt be condemned
[56:57] so please understand
[56:59] and i'm not just speaking to people who
[57:02] are the same faith or follow the same
[57:04] ministry or message that we do
[57:06] i'm speaking to people of all kinds of
[57:08] faiths and i'll tell you there are many
[57:10] people out there that when they hear the
[57:12] word holiness the first thing that comes
[57:14] to their mind is legalism and they don't
[57:17] even understand why we would choose to
[57:20] live a different life and maybe not
[57:23] follow the fads and and traditions of
[57:26] and and all the
[57:28] pop culture i guess they call it now
[57:31] they they can't understand and they
[57:33] think that automatically we think that
[57:35] those are the things that bring us
[57:37] salvation but i want you to know that
[57:40] that has nothing to do with how we are
[57:42] saved we are saved by faith in the blood
[57:46] of jesus christ grace brings that great
[57:49] blood to our life and we are
[57:52] saved by grace not by works lest any man
[57:55] should boast but as we yield ourselves
[57:58] because to be born again is to not only
[58:00] be justified but also to be sanctified
[58:04] and to be filled with the holy ghost the
[58:07] spirit of god and that holy ghost within
[58:10] us
[58:10] by the spirit of holiness is bringing us
[58:14] to a place where we begin to see that
[58:17] we're going to answer every believer
[58:20] every person going to answer for what
[58:23] comes out of our mouth
[58:25] now
[58:26] before we close this evening let me say
[58:29] a few other things and then i want to
[58:31] give you a few quotations holiness is
[58:34] not established by external codes of
[58:37] living but by an internal way of living
[58:41] that works itself out in other words you
[58:45] can you can have the enlarged borders
[58:47] and you can you can pray with the
[58:49] phylacteries and you can do all the
[58:52] religious things and still be lost and
[58:54] undone without god but if you get the
[58:57] heart right if you allow the spirit of
[59:00] holiness to deal with your inner man and
[59:03] begin to birth the character of jesus
[59:06] christ in you then i'm going to tell you
[59:08] something it's going to work its way
[59:10] you're going to want to live holy
[59:13] consecrated dedicated and set apart
[59:17] you're not going to want to do anything
[59:19] that causes someone else to be tempted
[59:22] in lust or fornication or other sins
[59:25] you're going to want to present yourself
[59:27] in modesty and in purity and that's not
[59:30] in keeping of a code no siree not at all
[59:33] that's by allowing the holy spirit to
[59:36] show you how to walk and how to talk and
[59:39] how to conduct yourself and god places
[59:41] us you know in communities of faith he
[59:44] places us we were told many years ago
[59:47] here in our church that there was a
[59:49] parabolic anointing over this place and
[59:52] that god was going to use us in many
[59:55] different ways in the end time and that
[59:58] people would come through here that had
[1:00:00] no idea of the kind of faith that we had
[1:00:02] stood on but they would understand that
[1:00:05] god had chosen us to walk this walk as a
[1:00:08] parable and i tell you i've never seen
[1:00:10] an hour where walking before god in
[1:00:13] purity is sending such a message because
[1:00:16] the world is in such confusion in this
[1:00:19] hour there's got to be a people who know
[1:00:21] who they are and who know who their god
[1:00:24] is and who know what kind of power and
[1:00:28] ability he has so whenever holiness is
[1:00:31] only present in a church body by
[1:00:34] legislated rules and regulations from
[1:00:37] the outside it produces legalism it
[1:00:40] produces spiritual pride it produces uh
[1:00:44] religious spirits
[1:00:46] that this is bondage and nobody can grow
[1:00:50] spiritually or thrive spiritually in
[1:00:53] that kind of an atmosphere but when
[1:00:55] holiness is is emphasized from the
[1:00:59] inside out then we all can grow legalism
[1:01:03] itself produces nothing but condemnation
[1:01:06] and and legalism is when we hang all
[1:01:10] these things as our salvation when we
[1:01:12] say
[1:01:13] this is i do this i do that i do the
[1:01:15] other and and because of that
[1:01:18] this is how i know that i'm accepted by
[1:01:20] god and and and this is what saves us
[1:01:23] and then we start looking out and we say
[1:01:25] if you don't do it like i do it you're
[1:01:27] not saved and we make all kinds of
[1:01:30] judgments and condemnations we don't
[1:01:32] have time brother sister in this hour to
[1:01:35] worry about really what other people are
[1:01:37] doing we have got to come to be right
[1:01:40] ourselves we've got to yield to the
[1:01:42] spirit of holiness ourselves
[1:01:44] legalism in itself produces nothing but
[1:01:47] condemnation
[1:01:49] a lack of acceptance the feeling of
[1:01:51] never being able to measure up and this
[1:01:54] is not what god has come to do it
[1:01:56] produces this kind of an attitude that
[1:01:58] says this is too hard and i can't do it
[1:02:00] anymore and it frustrates people because
[1:02:03] they don't understand holiness it's not
[1:02:06] the external part first it's the
[1:02:08] internal the quality of your intake this
[1:02:11] is what jesus was teaching the quality
[1:02:14] of your intake dictates or determines
[1:02:17] the strength of your output if you don't
[1:02:20] hear the word on holiness you won't walk
[1:02:23] in holiness if you don't hear the truth
[1:02:26] of righteousness and you won't even
[1:02:28] accept and walk in god's righteousness i
[1:02:32] want to boil it down i want to boil it
[1:02:34] down tonight i want to tell you that
[1:02:36] holiness is a person
[1:02:39] it's the nature and character of the
[1:02:42] godhead
[1:02:43] revealed in the life of the believer
[1:02:47] this is holiness holiness is not
[1:02:49] man-made holiness is god made holiness
[1:02:53] is the nature of god
[1:02:56] not our human nature
[1:02:59] it's the nature of god demonstrated in
[1:03:02] our lives by demonstrating christ-like
[1:03:05] character
[1:03:06] that therefore dictates our external
[1:03:09] lifestyle our choices our decisions the
[1:03:13] way we conduct ourselves
[1:03:15] it's it's determined in the heart of a
[1:03:18] true believer by this spirit of holiness
[1:03:21] that lives on the inside of us you see
[1:03:24] it's his righteousness it's his
[1:03:27] righteousness that we're depending on
[1:03:30] now i'd like to share a few quotes from
[1:03:33] brother branham with you before we close
[1:03:35] our tuesday night service tonight
[1:03:38] i'd like to read from the message
[1:03:40] influence
[1:03:41] from
[1:03:42] 1963 from the city of new york and the
[1:03:45] state of new york that's new york new
[1:03:48] york
[1:03:49] he said it's the presence of god in our
[1:03:53] midst now
[1:03:54] that brings holiness
[1:03:58] it's not my holiness remember what we
[1:04:00] said just a moment ago holiness is a
[1:04:02] person
[1:04:03] it's the presence of god
[1:04:06] that brings holiness
[1:04:08] brother branham said not my holiness
[1:04:10] not yours
[1:04:12] but his holiness
[1:04:15] his presence is what brings the holiness
[1:04:19] remember we were talking about that bush
[1:04:22] on mount moriah mount moriah
[1:04:24] that god chose
[1:04:26] to put his pillar of fire in and speak
[1:04:29] to his prophet from just 30 seconds
[1:04:32] before that was an ordinary bush but now
[1:04:36] it was a holy bush growing on holy
[1:04:39] ground what made it holy the presence of
[1:04:42] god came down brother sister if there's
[1:04:45] anything about me that's holy if there's
[1:04:48] anything about you that's holy it's the
[1:04:51] presence of jesus christ it's god's holy
[1:04:55] ghost in us
[1:04:57] it's his holiness in us that makes us
[1:05:00] holy
[1:05:01] he goes on to say we ought to humble
[1:05:03] ourselves
[1:05:04] cover ourselves in reverence
[1:05:07] humility and say lord jesus receive me
[1:05:12] into your kingdom his holiness
[1:05:16] not ours
[1:05:18] holy spirit i
[1:05:20] really like that
[1:05:22] let me read be not afraid
[1:05:24] tucson arizona 1963
[1:05:28] i i just underlined it all highlighted
[1:05:31] it all the whole whole paragraph here he
[1:05:34] said as i said there's no great men
[1:05:38] and holy men
[1:05:40] there is not we're not any of us holy
[1:05:44] we got a holy spirit in us
[1:05:47] but we're not holy it's he
[1:05:51] he is the one is holy see
[1:05:54] it's his holiness
[1:05:56] not mine not yours his what do you think
[1:05:59] about that what do you think about the
[1:06:02] fact that i don't have to produce
[1:06:05] some kind of holiness
[1:06:07] i don't have to make myself holiness
[1:06:10] i just have to yield myself to the
[1:06:13] spirit of holiness that's working in me
[1:06:15] by the holy ghost and what that spirit
[1:06:18] does it rises up in me producing
[1:06:21] reproducing the holiness of god and
[1:06:24] there's no way in the world i can keep
[1:06:26] living like i lived before there's no
[1:06:28] way i can keep making the decision i now
[1:06:32] want to be careful what i put before my
[1:06:34] eyes i now want to be careful what i
[1:06:36] find myself participating in i now want
[1:06:39] to be careful what i what i where i go
[1:06:42] and what i do and even who i go with i
[1:06:46] now want to be careful because i
[1:06:48] understand that there's a holiness
[1:06:51] that that i'm carrying that is not my
[1:06:54] own it's him it's his and it's precious
[1:06:58] oh i can't tell you how precious it is
[1:07:01] in the message christianity versus
[1:07:04] idolatry do i have a few more minutes
[1:07:06] yes i do paragraph 191 he said we are
[1:07:10] made partakers of his holiness
[1:07:15] we
[1:07:16] in his image
[1:07:18] we are living images of a living god
[1:07:23] been dead to self
[1:07:25] raised with him he said now listen to
[1:07:28] this
[1:07:29] his word made flesh
[1:07:32] again in us
[1:07:35] his word made flesh again in us
[1:07:40] producing in us his word producing in us
[1:07:44] the spirit of holiness producing in us
[1:07:48] his righteousness his holiness he said
[1:07:51] oh brother never look
[1:07:54] look what is it
[1:07:57] it's
[1:07:58] it's he excuse me he said not the i was
[1:08:03] reading from the from the last one he
[1:08:05] said not the not the mythical
[1:08:08] imaginary god sitting out there but the
[1:08:12] living god
[1:08:13] what is the living god the word in you
[1:08:18] making itself
[1:08:20] real
[1:08:21] i think we better read that again
[1:08:23] because you may have a religious mindset
[1:08:26] and if you have a religious mindset
[1:08:28] you'll be rejecting that before you give
[1:08:30] your heart an opportunity to embrace it
[1:08:32] he said it's not the mythical imaginary
[1:08:35] god sitting out there but the living god
[1:08:37] he said what is the living god the word
[1:08:41] in you
[1:08:43] making itself real he said phew glory to
[1:08:47] god oh i know you think i'm a holy
[1:08:50] roller maybe i am but oh
[1:08:52] brother do you see it brother sister i
[1:08:56] see it
[1:08:57] i see that it's the word of god in us
[1:09:01] manifesting his righteousness and
[1:09:04] holiness he said triumph over every
[1:09:08] denomination triumph over all paganism a
[1:09:12] living god made manifest in a living
[1:09:15] temple
[1:09:16] and the word of god which is god
[1:09:19] remember
[1:09:20] the bible tells us
[1:09:23] that that god is his word and the word
[1:09:27] was god
[1:09:28] hallelujah he said
[1:09:31] triumph over every denomination triumph
[1:09:34] over all paganism a living god made
[1:09:37] manifest in a living temple and the word
[1:09:40] of god which is god is made flesh in you
[1:09:44] why
[1:09:45] you're seated in heavenly places
[1:09:47] triumphed over all things in christ
[1:09:50] jesus amen oh i just love it he said i
[1:09:54] have to skip something and go on he was
[1:09:57] getting carried away in this great truth
[1:10:01] there is this word of god
[1:10:04] working in us
[1:10:06] through us
[1:10:08] bringing us to a place where we can
[1:10:10] trust the holy ghost we can trust the
[1:10:14] spirit of holiness let me read a little
[1:10:16] more
[1:10:17] in a message it wasn't so from the
[1:10:19] beginning
[1:10:20] he said send his holy spirit down here
[1:10:23] to come into our flesh
[1:10:25] which he has sanctified with his own
[1:10:27] blood
[1:10:28] you believe in sanctification
[1:10:31] be ye holy for i am holy he said now you
[1:10:35] cannot be
[1:10:37] holy
[1:10:39] here's god asking us to be holy brother
[1:10:41] man said now you cannot be holy
[1:10:44] then he explains i'm not depending on my
[1:10:47] holiness
[1:10:49] i have none
[1:10:52] remember i can do it all right
[1:10:56] i can look real good on the outside
[1:10:59] and yet i have no holiness
[1:11:03] he said rem i have none
[1:11:05] he said but i'm depending on his
[1:11:07] holiness
[1:11:08] it's his holiness that i'm looking at
[1:11:12] not what well not what i was
[1:11:15] but what he is
[1:11:16] that's it go back to the beginning there
[1:11:19] it is jesus christ the same
[1:11:23] yesterday
[1:11:25] let's go to god's provided way
[1:11:28] paragraph 38 i know some of you are
[1:11:30] going to believe in me if i don't hurry
[1:11:33] we're sinners
[1:11:35] saved by grace
[1:11:37] we must recognize that from the richest
[1:11:40] to the poorest from the best dressed to
[1:11:43] the worst dressed
[1:11:44] as the outside dressing has nothing to
[1:11:48] do with it it'll perish
[1:11:50] but the inside is what lasts i'd rather
[1:11:55] have my spirit covered with the robe of
[1:11:59] his holiness
[1:12:00] than to have the best suits that could
[1:12:02] be bought in all the world sure rich in
[1:12:06] the kingdom of god
[1:12:09] and this was an hour where he's
[1:12:11] preaching and trying to explain to
[1:12:13] people it's it's not your money
[1:12:16] it's not your your class of people
[1:12:19] somebody might stand there in a fine
[1:12:22] italian three-piece suit
[1:12:25] somebody else may come in the best
[1:12:28] pair of old bib overalls they have
[1:12:31] they don't have a nice fine italian
[1:12:34] suit an italian loafer shoes but they
[1:12:37] get up and they wash those bib overalls
[1:12:39] and press them up come to the house of
[1:12:42] god to worship and god does not esteem
[1:12:45] the man in his italian suit any higher
[1:12:49] than he does the old farmer in his bib
[1:12:52] overalls it is not that outward dropping
[1:12:56] or dressing that makes god accept you oh
[1:13:00] no
[1:13:01] it's what he has done in you and for you
[1:13:04] and now through you that makes you
[1:13:07] acceptable hallelujah and it's more
[1:13:11] important it's more important
[1:13:13] abraham
[1:13:15] i'm going to finish this
[1:13:16] abraham paragraph 21 i've got this one
[1:13:20] and one more
[1:13:22] he said now you say
[1:13:24] that has an awful calvinistic swing to
[1:13:26] it brother branham he said that's right
[1:13:28] it does and calvinism is all right as
[1:13:31] long as it stays true to the bible but
[1:13:34] when it gets off on the wrong limb then
[1:13:36] it's no good you see brother branham
[1:13:38] believed in calvinism but he also knew
[1:13:41] there was something extreme
[1:13:44] calvinism developed into something
[1:13:46] extreme that he couldn't follow that
[1:13:48] through the word and when it gets out of
[1:13:51] the word that's when we get off of it
[1:13:52] amen and he made it very clear he said
[1:13:56] now you say that has an awful
[1:13:57] calvinistic swing to it brother brown
[1:13:59] that's right it does and calvinism is
[1:14:01] all right as long as it stays true to
[1:14:03] the bible but when he gets off on the
[1:14:05] wrong limb then it is no good
[1:14:08] armenianism that's to say same same
[1:14:11] thing with armenianism
[1:14:13] as long as that stays with the word you
[1:14:15] can take all the doctrine
[1:14:17] as long as it stays with the word man
[1:14:20] will sometimes try to get you to swallow
[1:14:22] something it may sound good to the ear
[1:14:25] but if it doesn't line up with the word
[1:14:26] it's not of god he said holiness is
[1:14:29] correct as long as it stays in bible
[1:14:32] holiness
[1:14:33] not your holiness but his holiness see
[1:14:37] then it's not my holiness i'm not
[1:14:39] depending i'm still reading
[1:14:42] i'm not depending on my holiness i have
[1:14:45] none but i'm holy
[1:14:48] wh i like it w-h-o-l-l-y
[1:14:52] holy
[1:14:53] trusting in his holiness
[1:14:57] now it goes on
[1:14:59] see
[1:15:00] it's he
[1:15:01] he's the one who did it
[1:15:04] not my works but his finished works that
[1:15:08] i rest assured
[1:15:10] that i was received into the beloved and
[1:15:13] when the beloved was received by god
[1:15:16] you got to hear this
[1:15:18] he said not my works but his finished
[1:15:21] works that i rest assured that i was
[1:15:24] received into the beloved and when the
[1:15:26] beloved was received by god god received
[1:15:29] me in christ
[1:15:31] that settles it see
[1:15:34] no negatives no ifs and ands
[1:15:37] it's a finished work how many of you are
[1:15:40] trusting in that finished work if you're
[1:15:43] trusting in anything else it'll fail if
[1:15:46] you're trusting that you'll always do
[1:15:47] the right thing that'll fail but if
[1:15:50] you're trusting that if you continue to
[1:15:52] yield to him he will cause you he'll
[1:15:55] lead you he'll anoint you to do the
[1:15:58] right thing
[1:15:59] now one last
[1:16:01] quote is paragraph eight
[1:16:04] from god
[1:16:06] perfecting his church
[1:16:09] being hampton new york
[1:16:12] he said so we give god praise tonight to
[1:16:15] know that the holy spirit is in us
[1:16:17] last night i was teaching on the
[1:16:19] perfection
[1:16:20] god perfecting his church
[1:16:23] bringing the church to perfection
[1:16:25] through the lord jesus christ that how
[1:16:28] we being dead in christ take on
[1:16:30] abraham's seed our heirs according to
[1:16:34] the promise i believe that
[1:16:37] and we are perfected i believe that
[1:16:40] not in our own self
[1:16:42] not in our own holiness
[1:16:45] he said my someone said to me not long
[1:16:47] ago said brother branham do you believe
[1:16:49] in holiness
[1:16:51] i don't know why they were asking him a
[1:16:53] question like that
[1:16:54] brother branham do you believe in
[1:16:56] holiness
[1:16:57] i said yes sir without such no man can
[1:17:00] see god that's what the bible said
[1:17:03] i said but not my holiness
[1:17:06] cause i have not any
[1:17:08] i believe in holiness see
[1:17:10] something that he has done and it's that
[1:17:13] i rest my hopes upon
[1:17:16] not on my own merits
[1:17:20] i have none
[1:17:22] i rest upon his merits
[1:17:26] having this assurance
[1:17:28] as he loves me
[1:17:30] i love him
[1:17:32] and the whole thing
[1:17:35] becomes a love affair hallelujah oh
[1:17:38] those words are precious
[1:17:41] for me to hear again tonight
[1:17:43] it's not on my merit
[1:17:46] it's not on i don't have any assurance
[1:17:49] that that's enough
[1:17:50] but i have assurance that as he loves me
[1:17:54] i love him did you know you couldn't
[1:17:56] really love him if he didn't love you
[1:17:59] you couldn't seek after god if he wasn't
[1:18:02] seeking after you
[1:18:04] and so i want us to understand
[1:18:08] yes
[1:18:09] we have to set ourselves apart from this
[1:18:11] whole world there's a spirit of the age
[1:18:14] and a spirit of the world that will take
[1:18:16] us right down that slippery slope
[1:18:19] into unbelief
[1:18:21] yes i believe that yes i believe that a
[1:18:24] church has a right to have a conviction
[1:18:28] and set a standard for the body i
[1:18:30] believe that
[1:18:31] i believe that that that god speaks to
[1:18:34] leadership and speaks to pastors
[1:18:38] and helps them if they're hearing him to
[1:18:40] know there are certain things that we
[1:18:42] must do differently here because we've
[1:18:44] been called to be different
[1:18:47] but i want you to know nothing all the
[1:18:49] things that make us different
[1:18:51] all the things that set us apart
[1:18:54] none of that is what makes us holy it's
[1:18:57] god's holy presence
[1:19:00] it's the spirit of jesus christ in us
[1:19:03] that makes us holy don't you want more
[1:19:05] of him don't you want more of the holy
[1:19:07] ghost
[1:19:08] don't you want to allow the spirit of
[1:19:11] holiness to walk down every hallway
[1:19:15] of your heart
[1:19:16] every hallway open every door
[1:19:20] look in every room find anything in
[1:19:23] there that is not reflecting jesus
[1:19:26] christ i want the spirit of holiness
[1:19:29] to convict
[1:19:31] to speak to show us
[1:19:34] and then we understand that the holy
[1:19:36] ghost the same holy ghost that convicts
[1:19:38] us is the same holy grace same holy
[1:19:41] ghost that brings the spirit of grace in
[1:19:45] to give us courage and strength to make
[1:19:47] a difference
[1:19:49] to turn loose of things
[1:19:51] that we have held on to
[1:19:53] because they are
[1:19:54] misshaping our character there are
[1:19:57] things that we just simply have to let
[1:19:59] go
[1:20:00] we've carried them so long
[1:20:02] and they have began to misshape our
[1:20:05] character
[1:20:06] and we can't do it on our own but i tell
[1:20:08] you by the spirit of holiness by the
[1:20:10] spirit of his grace we can allow him to
[1:20:14] walk into every room
[1:20:16] look under every bed search every closet
[1:20:20] turn the searchlight of his love onto
[1:20:22] the deepest part of who we are and put
[1:20:25] his finger on every part that needs more
[1:20:28] of him
[1:20:29] i believe if you have a hunger for more
[1:20:31] of him it's a testimony to us tonight
[1:20:34] that there's more of him to be had
[1:20:36] there's more of him available and i want
[1:20:40] to thank you tonight
[1:20:41] for joining us in this study together i
[1:20:44] want us just to yield ourselves to the
[1:20:46] lord
[1:20:48] we just open our heart
[1:20:50] there's a little song i don't know if i
[1:20:52] can get at a cappella or not but i'll

[1:23:45] lord this is our desire tonight
[1:23:48] that we would make room for you
[1:23:52] that you would fill us and refill us
[1:23:56] with your holy ghost
[1:23:58] lord i ask for grace
[1:24:02] for every person under the sound of my
[1:24:04] voice
[1:24:06] that we might all find grace
[1:24:09] to yield more
[1:24:11] to the holy ghost that lives inside of
[1:24:14] us and if we haven't received the
[1:24:17] baptism of the holy ghost i'm asking you
[1:24:20] lord to baptize the believers
[1:24:23] those who may be seeking a real
[1:24:25] experience with you lord you're the one
[1:24:28] who gives you're the one who pours it
[1:24:31] out
[1:24:33] some of us have been filled with the
[1:24:35] baptism of the holy ghost for so many
[1:24:37] years he's still here he's still real he
[1:24:41] still abides but lord sometimes we need
[1:24:44] a refilling
[1:24:46] we need to just be more yielded to the
[1:24:48] spirit
[1:24:49] for we know that if we're led by the
[1:24:52] spirit of god it testifies
[1:24:54] that we are the sons of god
[1:24:57] may the spirit of holiness put its
[1:25:00] finger
[1:25:01] on anything in our life oh god
[1:25:04] deep down that needs to be ministered to
[1:25:07] that needs to be
[1:25:09] we need to be freed from father help us
[1:25:12] to understand that repentance is a gift
[1:25:16] it's not a given it's a gift
[1:25:18] and lord once you show us
[1:25:21] something there may we find grace and
[1:25:24] courage
[1:25:25] to repent
[1:25:26] and that repentance is not begging you
[1:25:30] that repentance is trusting you
[1:25:33] it's saying lord i'm so sorry for how
[1:25:36] i've got off on the wrong track
[1:25:39] i'm so sorry that i've let something
[1:25:42] take up space
[1:25:44] in my life that could be filled with you
[1:25:47] and i'm asking for your forgiveness
[1:25:49] and i'm asking that your mercy would
[1:25:51] come
[1:25:52] and you would let that holy ghost go
[1:25:55] into that area drive out all that is
[1:25:58] unlike you
[1:26:00] cause me to grow up into who you have
[1:26:02] called me to be
[1:26:03] oh this is our desire lord
[1:26:06] this is our desire let it be o god
[1:26:09] let it be that there will be answers to
[1:26:11] these prayers
[1:26:13] as we agree together i feel sweet
[1:26:16] presence of the lord
[1:26:19] i'm so thankful for the sweet spirit of
[1:26:22] god
[1:26:23] he could come
[1:26:25] and really rake us over the coals
[1:26:28] sometimes he comes with a rebuke
[1:26:31] but i tell you
[1:26:32] so much is accomplished when the holy
[1:26:34] spirit just come and melts us
[1:26:37] he just softens us
[1:26:39] when we feel that softening of the holy
[1:26:41] spirit we just want to yield
[1:26:43] oh god i want to get out of the way i
[1:26:45] want bitterness gone
[1:26:47] i want anger gone i want anything in me
[1:26:50] that's trying to take a root hold that
[1:26:53] is not like you i want the holy ghost to
[1:26:55] dig that up
[1:26:57] show me what i can do to get rid of that
[1:27:00] because you are birthing a people

[1:30:33] member
[1:30:34] would you loose your healing virtue
[1:30:38] oh god there were several who sent
[1:30:40] messages to say that beginning sunday
[1:30:43] they fell to turn around in their body
[1:30:46] but lord i'm praying for those that
[1:30:48] haven't yet experienced a real a real
[1:30:51] turnaround in their health
[1:30:53] would you touch them oh god tonight

[1:31:03] antibodies to raise up oh god i believe
[1:31:06] you're the creator i believe you can
[1:31:08] create an infusion of antibodies
[1:31:12] in everybody that's fighting i know our
[1:31:14] bodies start creating those but it's
[1:31:17] sometimes not enough
[1:31:18] so lord i'm asking you to do what you
[1:31:22] can do you created these bodies
[1:31:25] lord i've watched you already bring
[1:31:28] those
[1:31:29] through this thing in their 80s
[1:31:32] so i know that you're concerned and you
[1:31:35] care
[1:31:37] for each one who is suffering
[1:31:39] and so lord i'm asking you that you will
[1:31:42] let this thing pass from us in the name
[1:31:44] of the lord jesus christ
[1:31:46] that we might be gathered together again
[1:31:49] in person
[1:31:50] and worship you and sit under your holy
[1:31:52] precious
[1:31:54] word we're so thankful for it
[1:31:56] lord i thank you for those who've
[1:31:58] labored in any way
[1:32:00] during this time of stream only to help
[1:32:03] make an atmosphere that we might reach
[1:32:05] out and be a blessing
[1:32:07] and so lord we ask for every one of
[1:32:10] those needs that we have in our heart
[1:32:12] for those who are in trouble
[1:32:14] for those who are backslidden and need
[1:32:17] to come home to you
[1:32:19] we're just lifting that all up lord we
[1:32:21] thank you for making provision for this
[1:32:23] church and for this ministry in this
[1:32:26] difficult time
[1:32:28] and we will give you glory and honor and
[1:32:30] praise for we ask these things in the
[1:32:32] exalted name
[1:32:35] of the lord jesus christ
[1:32:37] amen and all the saints said amen amen
[1:32:42] so i want to thank you again for being
[1:32:44] with us tonight we're giving you a
[1:32:46] little getting out of here a little
[1:32:47] early
[1:32:49] i want you to
[1:32:50] uh know that we love you we're praying
[1:32:53] for you not just our own church folks
[1:32:55] but folks around the world
[1:32:57] i want to say to our local body that it
[1:33:00] would just be a great help to us at this
[1:33:02] time if you would
[1:33:04] either make arrangements to drop your
[1:33:06] tithe and offering by the office here or
[1:33:09] online
[1:33:11] now many have
[1:33:12] really been faithful online and you just
[1:33:15] have to remember that it takes us
[1:33:17] a week two weeks and sometimes three
[1:33:20] weeks according to the bank to be able
[1:33:22] to have those funds to be able to pay
[1:33:24] bills and do things that we have to do
[1:33:26] and so if you are able to make
[1:33:29] arrangements to bring something by then
[1:33:31] you need to check with one of us and
[1:33:33] we'll be glad to meet you and and we
[1:33:36] thank those of you who have done that
[1:33:39] uh we have a deposit we will be making
[1:33:41] in the morning because some of you have
[1:33:43] been doing that and a little bit has
[1:33:44] come in the mail
[1:33:46] and god's meeting the need but i just
[1:33:48] need to remind you that this has been an
[1:33:51] unusual time now
[1:33:53] through the whole pandemic i think this
[1:33:55] is about the longest or maybe
[1:33:58] equal to the longest
[1:34:00] it could be that we were
[1:34:02] i was a little under the weather the
[1:34:03] last time we had some stream only so it
[1:34:05] could have been about the same amount of
[1:34:07] time but it sure feels like a long time
[1:34:10] that we've been apart but god is good
[1:34:12] he's faithful and he's keeping us so
[1:34:15] the lord willing let's gather together
[1:34:17] those who are able those who are without
[1:34:19] fever and who are overcoming
[1:34:22] and out of quarantine those who would
[1:34:24] like to let's gather together sunday
[1:34:27] morning at 11 o'clock if anything should
[1:34:29] change we'll reach out to the local body
[1:34:31] those of you who stream
[1:34:34] you stream
[1:34:35] nothing changes for you we're glad to
[1:34:37] have you we're streaming on our app on
[1:34:40] youtube on facebook and on our website
[1:34:43] and so if you have prayer requests that
[1:34:45] you want us to pray over you send them
[1:34:47] and we will do that we just want to say
[1:34:50] again tonight god bless you thank you
[1:34:52] for being with us bye-bye until sunday
[1:35:14] you
