[0:00] So Samson was going to be a Nazerite
[0:02] from the time of his birth. He could
[0:04] come not come in contact with the vine,
[0:07] the grape, anything to do with the
[0:09] grape. He could not come near a dead
[0:12] body and he could not put a razor on his
[0:16] head. His hair was to be divided into
[0:19] seven locks. Look at how spiritual, how
[0:22] prophetic, how symbolic it was that his
[0:26] hair would be divided by seven locks.
[0:30] What a number seven is. Some people call
[0:33] it God's divine number. It's a number of
[0:36] wholeness and a number of completion and
[0:38] a number of perfection. God was about to
[0:41] bring a deliverer who would not only
[0:45] begin to deliver Israel, but he would
[0:48] set an example even for us today that
[0:51] you can slip, you can fail, you can make
[0:54] a mistake, but if you'll stay faithful,
[0:57] if you'll bring yourself back to the
[0:59] purpose of your birth in repentance,
[1:02] that God will not even remember against
[1:05] you the sin, the failure, the shame that
[1:09] you brought.
[1:11] This is good news.
[1:13] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I've
[1:15] disappointed him before.
[1:17] &gt;&gt; And so for me, it's very good news.
[1:19] &gt;&gt; In Judges chapter 13, verse 24 and 25,
[1:23] and the woman bare a son and called his
[1:27] name Samson, and the child grew, and the
[1:32] Lord blessed him. He was blessed in his
[1:36] mother's womb and he came from his
[1:39] mother's womb still under the blessing.
[1:42] BUT IT'S VERSE 25 that I want to
[1:44] emphasize to you today. And the spirit
[1:48] of the Lord began to move upon him. Born
[1:53] with a blessing, his childhood under a
[1:56] blessing. And then there came a time
[1:59] that the spirit of the Lord began to
[2:04] move upon him. It's a serious thing.
[2:09] It's not just for a special person. It's
[2:11] for whoever will surrender, whoever will
[2:14] yield. There's an anointing that is
[2:17] promised for the bride in the scripture
[2:19] and in the message that's beyond just a
[2:23] good feeling.
[2:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25] HE WANTS TO NOT JUST VISIT YOU. HE WANTS
[2:28] TO OCCUPY YOU.
[2:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND IN ORDER TO PREPARE your house
[2:33] for him to come and take over, YOU'VE
[2:36] GOT TO WATCH YOUR eye gate. YOU'VE GOT
[2:37] TO GUARD YOUR EYE GATE. YOU'VE GOT TO
[2:39] GUARD YOUR EAR GATE.
[2:41] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT TO GUARD YOUR MOUTH GATE.
[2:44] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you TODAY THAT FOR
[2:46] WHATEVER REASON YOU were born, God has
[2:49] an anointing
[2:50] &gt;&gt; THAT IS SUFFICIENT. HE HAS AN ANOINTING
[2:54] THAT IS JUST RIGHT FOR WHATEVER your
[2:56] position is. If he's called you as an
[2:59] evangelist, he has an ANOINTING THAT'S
[3:02] BIG ENOUGH AND bold enough and powerful
[3:05] enough to make you an evangelist.
[3:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:09] &gt;&gt; If he's CALLED YOU TO PROPHESY, HE HAS
[3:11] AN ANOINTING THAT'S JUST RIGHT.
[3:16] &gt;&gt; It's not going to trickle down on your
[3:18] head like a drippy faucet. is going to
[3:20] rush over you more like a waterfall.
[3:23] Grant it, LORD. WE GOT SOME STUFF TO
[3:26] OVERCOME AND WE'RE GOING TO NEED IT TO
[3:29] BREAK IN MIGHTILY IN OUR LIVES. THAT'S
[3:31] WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN IN THIS BRIDE AROUND
[3:34] the world. SHE MUST HAVE A WAKING UP.
[3:39] &gt;&gt; AND GOD WILL USE A FORERUNNING REMNANT
[3:42] WHO WILL TAKE THE HAND OF A BACKSLID
[3:44] BRIDAL CHURCH.
[3:47] AMEN. IF SHE'S WILLING
[3:50] &gt;&gt; AND BECOME EYES TO SEE WHAT she cannot
[3:54] see. So, how important is the remnant?
