overcoming power oh Hallelujah by the blood by the blood of the lamb and you may be seated just a moment and by the word of Our Testimony we're overcoming praise God that was good good I knew it was going to be when you're playing the introduction I could already feel it and I'm so thankful and we didn't know for sure so we didn't mention it Tuesday night but the song that Kade sang Tuesday night is one the Lord had given him and it was exceptional and we kind of thought it might be when we couldn't find the words anywhere but it was a blessing if you didn't hear it go back and catch it it was a a real blessing to us we have so much to be thankful for I can't tell you what a blessing it was I wasn't here on Friday or yesterday so when we pulled on the campground today and it we saw a a

just pull it over here and get the work done we're ex so so blessed so thankful if you say too much much he gets sheepish but we believe the Lord's going to make a way to pay the hangers and to pay the finishers and to pay what else needs to be done because there are many folks traveling over the course of the next few weeks and uh so we have to have it done but that's nice because then you can critique the job and you can ask them to do it like you want to do it if they don't do it you can have them do it again and it's going to be so nice we are so blessed God is so good to all of us

bless every one of the streamers we are getting nearer and nearer to camp meeting time October 15th through the 20th we're believing that God is going to meet with us in profound ways sir blessed Holy Ghost ways I he's already doing that so why would he fail us at camp meeting time I don't believe he will all of you amazing streamers so many places around the world on YouTube and so many places around the world on on Facebook on the app on the website here is a brother we're worshiping god with you from Malawi we send you great greetings there brother South Africa is represented the Netherlands are represented the the great state of Indiana uh the the nation of uh to our North Canada so many God bless every one of you pul is leaving this afternoon for Iceland to be gone for a few days it's a it's a a bit of a business uh trip but there will be Ministry involved because he has a heart for Iceland and we're going to pray for him while he's away that God will use him in Mighty ways we're also going to pray that the favor of the Lord will fall upon the project uh that they're working on through gospel channel and that it will be blessed and that it will be a a a source of Grace provision uh for the kingdom of God for the work of the ministry television work is very very expensive work and when you are watching carefully your content well it's not easy to find the kind of content that you want and when you do they don't pay very well you know so we need to keep that Ministry going I saw in my files this week Hawk I didn't mention it to you but I have always given brother peric green the the credit for mentioning brother Erikson to me the first time but I I knew there was someone else but I couldn't remember it and I opened up my file and I had a letter from a brother in Florida I don't even know if that brother's still alive he had written the letter in 1991 and he said you need to make contact with brother Eric Ericson in iand so I heard the name first then and we have been praying for the work there for some time may God just continue to use it we believe that it's going to play a very important role at the end of the end when this little bride gets out of here folks are going to be scrambling to find something that will help them get through what's going to happen in this world television would be one of the most powerful sources that could be used in a time of worldwide crisis like the exit of the Bride do you understand that do you agree and we know that somehow every nation of the world is going to see the bodies of those two dead prophets laying in the street of Jerusalem the Bible tells us the whole world will look upon their dead body and the only way that is possible is through internet connection and television so you'd never convince me it's it's it's trash it's garbage for today it's not for the bride but we are thankful that it will be used I've told you over and over again in the early 50s my grandmother was was sitting on the platform of the church on Highway 10 and the preachers were preaching against the evil of television and how it would cause the church to walk away from truth and all of that has happened all of that is true and she she agreed and she she thought that was just profound and wonderful what was happening but the spirit of Prophecy fell on her she stood up on the back of the rostrom and began to prophesy that in the last days God would use the medium of Television to reach the last Souls the last ones that were going to be W would be one through television Ministry I believe that because the bride's not going to be here to preach to them are you with me and the Holy Ghost is not going to be here to draw them so they're going to be looking for whatever they could get a hold of that would offer them any kind of hope to get through the last days of Great Tribulation on this Earth I want us to be ready Matthew chap 24 in this series verse 10 and 12 and then shall many be offended you don't have to go out in the world looking for that church people wear their feelings on their sleeves uh there they shall be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another never been such an hateful hour never been such a deceiving hour and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many if we were to use brother brandom's interpretation of that word Prophet there we would say preacher he said that's what a prophet was in this context so many false preachers shall rise and somebody's going to believe them because the scripture said and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold not just sin come on not just sin not just transgression but specifically iniquity because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold are you following me it becomes Frozen and then in second Timothy chapter 1 and verse 7 for God hath not given us the spirit of fear you know recently someone said uh posted something like you're always talking about the spirit of this and the spirit of that and the spirit of the other I thought there were just two forces there are just two forces but there's more than two spirits in the world there two forces God and Evil no doubt about that but many many manifestations and administrations of evil and one of them is the spirit of fear and we can rest ass sure as a part of the overcoming bride that God hath not given us the spirit of fear but he's given us the spirit of power on the spirit of love and the spirit of a sound mind there it is not fear but of power and of love and let's say that last part together and of a sound mind I'm going to have my mind I'm going to have a sound mind because I'm laboring toward the mind of Christ I'm reaching for that father we're here today not to look at each other not to just have Fellowship not just to look around and see what we might see or hear uh some little piece of Gossip or story about somebody we're here for your word we're here to be taught we're here to be strengthened we're here to be corrected we're here to be encouraged we're here to receive whatever it is that you see that we have need of and are ready to feed us we position ourselves now spiritually and with our gift of faith we pull up our our chair we stick our legs under your table we've heard the call coming dying we're here today to eat at your table feed us well Lord don't let anything distract us from eating good today uh your word Goes Forth to accomplish all that it is sent forth to accomplish and we will give you glory and honor and praise for it's in the name above every name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah that we pray and the church said amen you may be seated we are speaking about the third spirit that we were told that we would have have to contend with in the bride around this proving season that we're in and I don't know how long it'll lasts and I don't know but what there'll be another one after this one but we're being tested and sifted and proven we're seeing unbelievable things happen things that we would have never dreamed of politically never dreamed of some of the things we're seeing spiritually never dreamed of the some of the things that we're seeing we're watching people that we love that we have had confidence in swallow seducing lies people that we would have never dreamed would have uh been a part of that kind of a move we're seeing things that we can hardly believe in fact we can't believe our eyes we we can't believe everything we see we can't believe everything that we hear we must every day set our mind on the word and come into full alignment and agreement with what God has said there is a devil there is an enemy he's a Seducer he's an counterfeit lion he's roaring like a wild man but I'm thankful that the The Lion of the tribe of Judah continues to Roar and we hear his voice and we distinguish it above all the other voices and above all the other noise can you say Amen we've talked about some of the ways that that this Spirit of iniquity uh uh could can bring things affect things in our life and we've talked about now the third Spirit The Familiar spirit and we've learned already quite a bit about how that Spirit can behave how it can manifest itself in somebody's life maybe somebody you love you might even be able to recognize this thing operating in your life let me say from the onset it was not my desire uh initially to help you identify these behaviors these manifestations of a familiar spirit in somebody else's life first we we we didn't we weren't trying to raise up more fruit inspectors we were hoping that you could catch a glimpse of your own behavior if you're manipulative you need to see it if you are distracting and uh all these other ways disrupting disturbing you need to recognize that and when thou art converted then you strengthen the Brethren then you start looking to help somebody else well doesn't that seem selfish absolutely not it seems wise am Jesus said to Peter these words I'm praying for you I'm lifting you up because Satan has desired to sift you a sweet but really he was saying but I've got good news for you cuz on the other end of this you're going to have a full conversion you're going to have a full birth and and God is going to use you to strengthen others and to help other that's our goal God help us to get right in every way so that we can be a life to other people people don't just care what you say they're watching what you do they're watching how you live they're watching how you behave they're watching how you control other situations instead of letting the Holy Spirit do it so we're looking at another manifestation of of a behavior that runs along uh this familiar spirit and it's intimidation and coercion now coercion and intimidation that runs right together with manipulation but it's a little bit different can you show us the definition of intimidation uh so that we can get a good understanding of that because we often want to blame the person who causes us to feel intimidated but here's the problem that person is operating in manipulation the problem with intimidation is not not the Intimidator but the intimidate on the problem is that we are allowing someone that's how that spirit will manifest if he's not manifesting in you to manipulate he will manifest in you to paralyze you by intimidation you can't blame the person you've got to look at yourself and you've got to realize there's always going to be a Goliath there's all but if you get your eyes on Goliath you'll miss watching the Giant Killer we're looking to the Giant Killer we're not looking at Goliath we're trying to see what's wrong with us that our knees are knocking and we're hiding when he starts breathing out these accusations we want to find out what it takes to be a champion we don't want to run from the roar we don't want to run from the threats we want to run right out onto the battlefield and say who do you think you are you uncircumcised Philistine this intimidation is the act of making someone else timid or fearful by real or implied threats to frighten or threaten someone in order to persuade coercion is to persuade by using force or threats to apply pressure by bullying or belittling someone verbally tearing down their own esteem if you're in a marriage where that kind of spirit is operating it is not a healthy relationship a man doesn't have to beat down to control amen a man doesn't have to abuse and intimidate to lead are you understanding that not a godly man we find that bullies and there's a lot of bullying that goes on boyfriends will sometimes bully a girlfriend girlfriend listen if there's bullying going on now what do you think it'll be like when the license goes through you better watch that now you better draw boundaries now you better understand now that bull buling is not to be a part of the marriage not a Godly marriage not a Godly relationship bullies will use intimidation to force their victims to do what they want them to do can you imagine that in Chicago they would get out in the streets during the the DNC the Democratic National Convention and they would stop traffic and they would refuse these protesters anti- Jew je is anti-israel protesters they would stop vehicles and refuse to let the vehicle pass through unless they said we are fighting for a free Palestine can you imagine when when we heard that on the news we wondered how would we respond you're you're in a busy intersection and someone says unless you speak out free Palestine we're not going to let let you go through the public street I'm not sure running over somebody would be the right way out of that but the Temptation would sure be there yes sir do you understand yes sir we may never may God help us to never have to deal with something like that and be forced to make a decision because I've got a feeling I might bump somebody just slightly out of my way I don't do real well with intimidation the problem is some of us are living with that stuff a lot closer to our lives and we'll never change others you can't and even to hope to is a form of subtle Witchcraft and you don't want to be operating in witchcraft trying to change somebody else's will you understand praying praying against someone's own will can easily become Unholy intercession you're asking God to force someone God is a gentleman the holy spirit is a dove God could but he rarely does force someone he gives us a free will hello so when you're trying to manipulate someone's decisions through prayer when you're trying to make someone do a certain thing the thing you think would be the best solution and you're using prayer as an excuse that's not holy intercession that's manipulation and Witchcraft what you somebody say well then I don't know how to pray for that person remember what we said when you don't know what to say you've got two solutions you can pray in English not my will but your will be done on Earth in Earth even as it is in heaven or you can let the holy spirit of God pray through you with groanings that cannot be understood and then he knows the mind of God but when you get down and start praying change her mind change his mind change his will uh brother God doesn't normally operate like that and not only is that a not not a good thing to do it will turn on you and you will be affected by praying that kind of an Unholy prayer it's your will be done Lord you know what it takes so we don't pray prayers you know break every bone in their body but save them somebody said that's love no that's not quite love may make you feel like you're loving but that's manipulative you don't have to tell God how to get them now I got to be honest sometimes I say get them God and I leave it alone you you you you can get them with with with Compassion or you can snatch a knot in them it's up to you just you see what's going on you go deal with them and he will it's better to do that we're not in we're not Intimidators we're not those who operate in coercion and we're not trying to get the Holy Ghost to control other people's lives who are not yet willing to surrender to the perfect will and Leadership of the Lord so bullies use intimidation to force their victims to do what they want them to do I want you to know the days of of bullying being only on the playground in school that's over with bullying takes place all the time on the work on the workforce on the job in families you can't do it my way we just won't do it at all in families in families selfishness in families pouting and bullying come on folks the word timid is in the middle of the word intimidation and aptly describes the state of nervousness caused by a particular person who's operating in a spirit of manipulation or intimidation however intimidation is not always the result of another person's actions situations also have the power to create intimidation if someone has a tendency toward timidity which by the way is not meekness and it is not humility if you've got the def the American dictionary definition of timidity and if you think being timid means humble you're wrong if you think timid means being uh uh what was the other word I I used humble humility Meek meekness if you think that that's what it means you better look a little closer at the scripture that's not what it is at all in fact the the very uh Greek definition from the Bible of the word timid is cowardice God's not against humility he promotes it God's not against meekness he requires it but God's not real fond of cowardice I'll show you some of this in a minute some people are especially predisposed to be easily intimidated and are quickly Paralyzed by fear while constantly blaming the other person of bullying them he bullied me she bullied me no maybe maybe maybe you're not going to change the Buller so what you've got to do is work on you we've got to get you out of that place of cowardice and get you to a place of Courage so that you can face the battle like a holy ghost filed woman of God man of God come on without any kind of a fear and without running away from the problem people often say I don't like confrontation I don't know anybody much some seem to but I don't know many people who really like confrontation some people thrive on an argument but most people don't like confrontation but I want you to know as Spirit-filled children of God sometimes we have to face it head on face to face we can't run away from it because we recognize that if we let the enemy get by with it he'll keep using that over and over and over and over again I hope you heard that some people are especially predisposed to be easily intimidated and are quickly paralized by fear while constantly blaming the other person and bullying them either of these manifestations either the Intimidator or the one who is paralyzed by fear and timidity either of these manifestations can be a sign of a demonic presence most likely connected to a familiar spirit one that's been running through your family line generationally causing each generation at least one or two in a family line in each generation to become paralyzed so that you can't move forward so that you can't make a good decision for yourself and for those who are depending on you may God Deliver Us from being paralyzed by fear and cowardice God hath not given you say it with me God hath not given me a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind let me give you the King James version plus the SLS version of 2 Timothy 1:7 this is my translation added to the King James for God hath not given us the spirit of fear the word fear means to idity cowardice dread dread this is another place where procrastination can paralyze us dreading the moment dreading the the situation dreading to get in and get her done so God has not given us a spirit of fear timidity cowardice or dread but of power and that word power there is the dunamis that's the you shall receive power you shall receive dunamus after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and of love not fileo but Agape God's love received and given we receive his love and we're responsible to let it flow through us and of a sound mind which means a sound discipline and self-control folks we've got to discipline ourselves we've got to control ourselves we can't let emotion rule us are you with me yes sir don't look at me like you don't know who this is for I know your name I know where you live I know how you operate and the word of the Lord is here not to condemn but to convict us and to set us free he whom the son makes free is free indeed is free indeed the Amplified said for God did not give us a spirit of timidity of cowardice of Craven and cringing and fawning fear but he has given us a spirit of power and of love and of what calm calm calm down and well-balanced mind and discipline and self-control the word timidity means the the state of or quality of lacking self assurance courage bravery timidity is often a paralyzing fear of the unknown you know that's what makes me mad fear of what we don't don't know it's understandable to fear what we know but look how slick and Sly that devil is he wants us to fear based upon supposition what might be what could be what could possibly happen how many of you are guilty my hand is up he doesn't just want that to be a passing fleeting thing he wants it to be a driving force in your life he wants us to be paralyzed by fear of the unknown or unfamiliar and when some of us step into unfamiliar situations we overcompensate for our own fear and we become obnoxious I'm not stuck I'm just trying to think of a word better than the one that keeps coming to my mind I don't think I will God help us Deuteronomy chap 20 and verse 8 seems to indicate to us that fear and timidity can be contagious it says and the officer shall speak further unto the people and they shall say what man is there that is fearful and faint-hearted let him go and return unto his house lest his Brethren's heart faint as well as his heart all you got to do is get somebody who is bound with a spirit of timidity who has fear operating in their life and they start turning back and the next thing you know somebody else and somebody else and somebody else decid that they need to turn back and sometimes it rules a whole generation of a family everybody waiting on waiting on it to you know waiting on the best opportunity waiting on everything to be made right fixed wide open everything falling into place while we sit and wait and wait and wait and wait some people even get religious and call it waiting on the Lord come on now when they're not at all waiting on the Lord if you're waiting waiting on the Lord You're praying if you're waiting on the Lord You're fasting if you're waiting on the Lord You're drawing aside unto him being paralyzed by fear and indecisiveness is not waiting on the Lord if somebody could take a hold of that you would know something you would understand some things come on I your foolishness sometimes spoke you know well God said we could do this and God said we can do that and God said we shouldn't do that I'm going to keep coming right back to what Bobby Connor said I think some people they they're hear him they think God's talking a whole lot more than he's talking you got the Holy Ghost if you've got the Holy Ghost he can lead you come on now you know the enemy will cause a a wife or instance to think she doesn't have the Holy Ghost well that's convenient isn't it then she's easy material to be bullied I'm not asking any of you to buy my [Music] lunch I'm going to tell it like it is today and tomorrow too if I get a chance you see some people mistakingly put on timidity and fear thinking that they are practicing weekness and or humility that is a great error I don't have time this morning to really Define humility to go into the depth of what humility is and what meekness is but let me tell you something if you're having to work real hard to put it on it's not a trait that you're carrying if you're have if you're having to work hard hard to be timid which is not something you want to be remember that we have misunderstood the definition of timidity it doesn't mean quiet and mousy and it means fearful and cowardice so you want to be humble you want to walk in humility you want to manifest the fruit of the spirit of meekness but you don't want to be paralyzed by timidity and fear so you don't want to be putting something something on you know I'm just I'm just so humble I I just barely have an opinion now you know I'm going to tell you something if you men were looking for a wife like that it's just not even natural not to have an opinion not natural not to have an opinion and it should be that an opinion can be expressed without everything going spiritual all of a sudden if you have to constantly remind someone you're the head of the house something ain't working right because the Bible said if we love a wife like we should love a wife like Christ loved the church she would have no problem yielding no problem submitting because she trusts her husband's heart the only way a wife can trust a husband's heart is for him to operate in love and in sacrifice if he's selfish oh that's good preaching Galatians 5 verse 22 and 23 but the fruit of the spirit notice timidity fearful and cowardice are not mentioned here as the fruit of the spirit but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness gentleness not timidity and fear gentleness goodness you don't always have to be the bull in the China closet to be right gentleness goodness Faith meekness there it is temperance self-control against such there there is no law that word meekness there in the Greek means gentleness mildness and by implication it means humility in the message Hebrews chapter 6 number two in paragraph 495 brother brandham said there's not one thing left in the Bible listen there's not one thing left in the Bible as evidence of the Holy Ghost someone has asked me recently how do I know how do I know that I have the Holy Ghost well don't ask anybody around this message because they'll give you four or five different ways you can know none of which are completely definitive but here is one of the ways he said you can know as evidence there's not one thing left in the Bible as evidence of the Holy Ghost only the fruits of the spirit not the gifts the fruit of the spirit I preached a message years ago fruits on Fire H because I got a pack of somebody gave me a pack of uh what do you call them LIF Savers and the flavor was fruit on fire and boy I thought that would really preach because we don't just need the fruit of the spirit operating in our life we need anointed fruit we need fiery manifestation yes we do fire love there's not one thing left in the Bible is evidence of the Holy Ghost only the fruits of the spirit find out any place that Jesus said so yes sir the evidence of the Holy Ghost is the fruit of your spirit what comes out what holy spirit is bringing forth in your spirit Jesus said so by their fruit you shall know them not because they talked in tongues not because they called the messenger's name every other breath on but because they had the fruit the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering goodness gentleness meekness a and Temperance let's get that in and the fruit of the enemy did you know the devil has fruit too the fruit of the wrong spirit is enmity can I give you a common definition of the word enmity hard to get along with enmity hatred malice strife and so forth that's the fruit of the enemy look folk it is not right of us to come into a situation again like a bull in a China closet and then wonder why somebody won't be our friend it's because you come in like a rhinoceros right you come into a conversation like the bull that needed some love right you you come into a situation like you're going to take charge the the Bible said when we come in we ought to come in very low and very humble and take the lowest seat and not present ourselves as knowing everything it's very very Meek oh the fruit of I just feel it I feel the Holy Ghost I feel him putting his finger on us and the fruit of the enemy is enmity and hatred and Malice and strife and so forth that's a lot that's the fruit of the enemy so you can judge by the way you're living by the fruit you're manifesting where you're standing with God are you manifesting love joy peace longsuffering goodness Temperance meanness are are you manifesting hatred malice enmity strife and so forth and Etc it's a big question if your whole heart is in love with him and you love him and are gentle and live with him daily you know you've passed from Death un life if it isn't and you're otherwise you're just impersonating a Christian you're being phony that's right which all carnal impersonations will certainly be exposed we know that someone recently thought they were going to really drop a bomb on me and so they told me you probably don't realize that there are three kinds of Believers in your church too if anybody in here would recognize it it would be me I always have hope that make believers can move up I even have hope for unbeliever because sometimes we're late in Blooming sometimes we're operating in unbelief and then all of a sudden we recognize who we are we step right up but of course I know there in this Church Believers make Believers and unbelievers I try my best not to treat them accordingly because the Holy Ghost is our judge but you you weren't hurting my feelings I think somebody thought they were really going to get me good hahaa I already know Colossians 31 12 and 13 put on therefore the I wanted to make sure that you don't misunderstand God wants us to be meek he wants us to be humble he doesn't want us to be timid and fearful put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of mind that means not to know it all meekness longsuffering uh forbearing one another preferring one another and what forgiving this is remember he said I'm talking to the elect of God here anybody identify as part of his elect am forgiving forbearing one another forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against you fold your arms stiffen your back Harden your head and wait on him to come and apologize is that what he said sir no it says if any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you just forgive them just forgive them just forgive them just forgive her I'm not going to forgive them until they come in P just forgive them you say you're the elect of God just forgive them quit waiting on them to cower quit waiting on them to humbly apologize they're probably driven by such a spirit they don't even know what they've done just forgive them somebody say let it go let it go let it go it's weighing you down they don't care you better care Let It Go Ephesians 41 and2 I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called with all liness God wants us to oper operate in lonliness but not in timidity and fear with all lonliness and meekness with long suffering forbearing one another in love that word loneliness there it's a m long in the Greek it means humility humbleness of Mind loneliness of mind the having a humble opinion of one's self when you constantly regurgitate smack talk emulation striving with competition maybe it's just a joke maybe you don't mean anything by it but the reality is it certainly doesn't present itself as having a humble opinion of oneself you can be proud of your accomplishments without being full of Pride you can be glad when you've achieved something without thinking too much of yourself come on he's calling us to loneliness and meekness modesty humility loneliness of mind this is how the spirit of Christ operates so don't you get them confused not timidity cowardice and fear no no no lonliness humility meekness that's what God's calling us to in the message adoption number two in Jeff paragraph 133 God by his election Grace called you God by his election Grace Sanctified you God by his election Grace and his power baptize you and put you into this land of rest they which have entered into this rest have ceased from their labor the scripture said and from their going asay going astray they're not just counting on backsliding they're counting on sliding in amen they cease from their works like God did from his they have help me joy unspeakable and full of Glory the Tree of Life Woo is blooming look around look around look around I want to see the tree of life if you're so right I want to smell the bloomen from the tree of life because their Hope Is Anchored praise God it's anchored in Christ Jesus they have longsuffering gentle goodness patience made Faith Faith meekness gentleness and so forth the tree of life is blooming in them because their Hope Is Anchored In Christ Jesus the witness of the Holy Ghost bearing record with signs and wonders following the Believers these signs shall follow them that believe as they go along they heal the sick they cast out Devils they speak with tongues they see Visions sir I thought only brother brandom was allowed a vision I thought only prophets of an Old Testament nature were allowed to see Vision I thought we had redefined the Book of Joel I thought we had explained it all away but here he is saying as they go along they heal the sick they cast out Devils they speak with tongues they see visions and they walk with God they talk with God no devil can move them they're steadfast cuz they've entered into rest forgetting those things in the past I'm free from the guilt of to of free from the fear of tomorrow I'm free from the guilt of the past they press towards the mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus there they are there they are that's that church that bride church can you say amen thank God thank God thank God now in First Peter chapter 5:8 let's go there be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour all right in the Amplified it says be well balanced temperate sober of mind be vigilant and cautious at all times for that enemy of yours the Devil roams around like a lion roaring in Fierce hunger seeking someone to do what to seize upon and devour it'll be you if you let him I don't know if any of you have ever heard of Young's literal translation of the Bible but it's an important translation to look at sometime because when it says literal that's exactly what it means only the words that are actually there appear and when you start taking a look at a literal translation you'll find out that there are lots of words added to a verse of scripture to help us understand it even in the good old favorite of the Catholic Church King James right there right there the literal Young's particular uh has a way of but the problem with it is it doesn't do any inverting and we know especially in Hebrew we read backwards and even in Greek certain phrases would appear backward in a literal translation so you can really get a little thrown off if you were going to say for instance I'd like to start reading in the literal translation well you you'd get a little twisted up because there a lot of the the ANS and and these and the Artic thems and a lot of things that would be added for for uh understanding won't be there so you'll just be kind of muddling around but there was a man who did a marvelous job with a literal translation of the scripture I've been aware of it for some time I've used it in my own study but I've never I've never shared h a verse of it with you before and because there are all kinds of uh churches and denominations and groups out there that use it and sometimes people are guilty by association and if you found out that you know someone out there in another uh cult likee group were to use this translation well maybe you'd be afraid of it altogether uh if that's the case please don't ever use the diaglot because the the the source that brother bam mentioned the diaglot well it's sanctioned by by 7-Day Adventists and uh Mormons the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and and many other groups like that but it's it's just simply a source of looking at what a word means so it doesn't matter who else adopts it right we got the same Bible this man's name was was JB Rotherham and his version is called the emphasized version and it is a literal translation using Hebrew words and Greek words but for for ease of understanding he will invert which is a common a common way of doing it in Translation he will invert a sentence which puts the subject in the right place and the verb in the right place and the preposition in the right place instead of reading it through and and rotham looked at First Peter 5'8 and he said be sober Be watchful your slanderous adversary and I said if anybody caught it if anybody expressed it Rotherham must have dealt with that Old Devil the Old Testament I think didn't even appear his translation didn't even appear on the scene until 1902 so that was way back there that he was dealing with the ad slanderous how many of you have ever found your enemy is a slanderous adversary as he caught it he made sure that the literal translation didn't lose its reality and say a roaring lion he caught it as a roaring lion like a roaring lion a counterfeit lion is walking about seeking I've told you before he doesn't want to just chew on you he wants to consume you he wants to completely devour you now in case you doubt this I know that a lot of folks aren't interested in Breaking this down but we're going too quickly in the original the word sober is the Greek word Neo it means discreet so God is saying through the Apostle be discre Creet be self-controlled it means to watch and be calm and collected in spirit didn't mean aggressive it means confident you don't have to be nearly as aggressive church I hope somebody's hearing me you don't have to be nearly as aggressive when you're confident to be temperate circumspect to govern both the outward and the inward Man by the rules of temperance modesty and mortification which means mortifying and strengthening cares will intoxicate the soul this is right from the from the Lexicon therefore be sober cares burdens worries family troubles job troubles car troubles will intoxicate the mind and the will and the emotion but God said you''ve got to be sober anyway you've got to be self-controlled anyway You've Got to Be watchful anyway you've got to be discreet and temperate and circumspect anyway you've got to govern both the outward and the inward Man by Temperance which is by self-control the word Vigilant be sober be vigilant Vigilant is a Greek word that means to keep awake to give strict attention to be cautious active watchful to take heed lest through remission and carelessness some destructive Calamity suddenly overtake you I want you to know if we were watching we could see the enemy approaching the reason why he catches Us by surprise is we are Intoxicated by the cares of this life and we're not watching like we need to watch God help us amen God help us be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil the lion walketh about I want to show you this word about if this don't sound like your your enemy this word about you wouldn't think it means this in English it doesn't necessarily say all of this but in the Greek it means to prow around without discipline your slandering enemy come on your slandering enemy prows around without discipline no control to Rove to go here and there you know sometimes we just need to be still sometimes we just need to stay put sometimes we just need to be mindful of the Season amen oh that's good preaching yes sir I don't say that too much but it is good preaching why because it's appropriate for where we are to prow around without discipline to Rove to go here and there to surround to Encompass look at this the Greek or coming from all angles that's your slithering deceiving slandering adversary and he doesn't like to come at you one way what does he like to do he'll touch every one of your soulish emotions he'll touch every vulnerable place in your life he'll press all the buttons that he knows you have come on and he wants to do what devour you look at the word devour it means to drink to swallow gulp down to engulf to submerge to drown to overwhelm to waste to destroy completely to annihilate he doesn't want to just gum on your arm he doesn't just want to take a chunk out of you he is seeking walking about coming at you from every angle because he wants to eat you up until there is nothing left you need to stand up today break out of the spirit of timidity and cowardness Destroy from your life the spirit of fear and raise up in the courage and the boldness of the Lord and say enough is enough is enough is enough is enough I've listened to your lies the last time the slanderous adversary that hypocrite imitator likes to turn us against each other so that he can relax while we devour one another Chief Joseph said it that way he's talked about the he was the government leison for the for the Nations of First Nations or Native American people they called him a traitor his own people called him a traitor because he tried to enter into agreement with the nation with our nation with the United States to try to bring the Indian nations into a place of provision and freedom and they they opposed him and they called him a coward and really he was one of the most noble Chiefs of them all not Desiring to sell out his people but realizing that they were defenseless against the strength of this nation and the best way to to provide a future for their people would have been to cooperate somebody has to be The Negotiator sometime somebody has to take an unpopular stand sometime Chief Joseph was that man and he often said this but in his address his initial inaugural address as Le uson to the government he said to his own people where the tribes of the nations were gathered together we have fought too many insignificant Wars among ourselves Creek against Chu toow Apache against Cherokee and now that the real enemy has come we have so we have fought so many insignificant Wars among ourselves and now that the real enemy has come we are too weak and defeated to stand against them that's why he decided we better try to cooperate or we'll have nothing left of the nation that we have possessed and held it could be the anthem of the church what Chief Joseph said about the Indian nations could be said about about Believers even around this message we fought so many insignificant Wars among ourselves that when the enemy shows up and here he is in the end time wanting to chew us up and swallow us for lunch and we're still worried about you know making sure that every word is infallible and building some icon that we can all look to and call it Jesus when he lives in us he's here this is the house he's building we we like to immortalize and uh exonerate the signs while failing to hear the voice the voice said I'm want to have a church here that's going to go forth in power and have control over her emotions in her tongue didn't I pretty well read that for you in just a moment this enemy in Galatians 515 and 16 in the Amplified but if you bite and devour one another do you remember you remember in the in the laws of diet when God said through the prophet Moses eat this don't eat that eat this don't eat that a lot of new testament Christians like to take New Testament scripture out of context and they like to use a story that has to do with going with the gospel to the Gentiles has nothing to do with food uh but they like to take that story of going to the gospel with the Gentiles and and and and decide that God has changed his mind and that we should then be able to eat whatever we want to as long as we bless it that's incorrect I'm never going to make a big thing over that again but it's incorrect it's just simply incorrect do what you will but don't pretend to twist the meaning of a scripture while you eat your ham sandwich amen means nothing he tells us what kind of birds we can eat and he bases a lot of this God was his idea not Moses he bases this on oft times on how they behave what they eat because in in in that early time of God giving those laws of diet for Moses we're assuming that the animals were rather pure they didn't eat uh you know genetically modified food they ate whatever grew so there's a possibility that even uh bottom feeding fish and and uh you know carry on eating animals would be much cleaner then than they are now but when God was giving this law of diet he did it this way because he probably looked ahead in time and he saw such an hour that that the animals if they're not natural fed and grassfed they are being fed grain that has been genetically modified from what it was supposed to be in the beginning which changes the physical Anatomy and and the processing of the body and that's why people get full of parasites and that's why people have so many problems brother brandham read in the reader digest that hybrid food even in his generation was causing a change in the anatomy of the human body he said it was causing men's bodies to become more like women and women's bodies to become more like men how would it know to do that because it was working against the hormones and when we're eating things that work against the hormones it's going to affect us Satan has more than one way of emasculating a man so he decides to fill them full of soy which changes the levels of male hormones in their body and over a period of overc consumption of soy products a man loses his ability to be fertile and yet the health gurus continue to tell us that tofu and soy milk is the best way to go and people continue to follow their favorite little guy not realizing that it's not only changing them hormonally it's probably leading to the mental confusion that some people have over what they're supposed to be because in Readers Digest brother brandom read back then that the the the uh hybrid food he called it we now call it uh GMO genetically modified uh it was causing a a woman's shoulders to become broader and her hips to become more narrow which closes the birth canal it causes her to have more problems in delivery and for the man it was actually bringing his shoulders in and causing his hips to spread don't tell me there's not some plan behind that kind of stuff so God was very careful in telling us what's good for food and one of the birds you know a chicken I don't know how it passed the list and I eat chicken every day of my life I don't know how it pass the list because it'll eat its own you know what but anyway it did it did it's got an ability they tell me to help purify itself depending on what it eats so anyway I hope so I hope they're right I hope they're right I just suggest you pay you know a dollar more for your I I do I suggest that you pay a little bit more eat chicken less maybe pay a little more for it and do your best to try to get something a little bit cleaner than what is readily available have you ever gotten some that didn't even taste real it didn't have the texture of real meat I would I would be a little bit afraid of that but one of the birds is specifically mentioned is the eagle do not eat the eagle why because the eagle represents a supernatural people it represents a prophetic people it represents an anointing that would arise in the last days the overcoming anointing of a flying eagle don't eat the eagle and here the Apostle Paul says the same thing but if you bite and devour one another in partisan Strife that doesn't necessarily mean Democratic and Republican partisan it means dividing yourselves into little clicks and groups if you bite and devour one another in partisan strife careful that you and your whole Fellowship this is Amplified are not consumed I don't mind somebody I'm going to preach now I don't mind somebody who has a gift of discerning of spirits but I reject your spirit of Suspicion on that's not a gift of the spirit it's not right to operate in suspicion we should always be careful who we're in agreement and relationship with but I don't appreciate people operating in suspicion toward One Another We're supposed to love and forgive and hope the best and pray the best and and wish the best for one another and if I need to stay away from somebody the Holy Ghost can help me know who that is don't fall under under the spirit of Suspicion and call it Discerning of spirits it's not it's not the same thing but I say walk and live habitually verse 16 in the Holy Spirit responsive to and controlled and guided by the spirit then you will certainly not gratify the cravings and desires of the Flesh of human nature without God you see the enemy is the counterfeit lion and when he Roars he Roars to scare you into submission he's the greatest Intimidator of them all so don't be shocked that when a familiar Spirit operates around us it operates with an intimidation and a coercion to try to force people control people into doing what the devil wants them to do it is to intimidate us so that we give up and his tactic is to surround us and Corner us and to come at us from every direction ction so we break down emotionally and we give in and we let the devil have his way somebody ought to say Amen John 12:42 I hope this is enough scripture for you nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him lest they should be put out of the synagogue yeah one man's influence hello one man's influence over another hello one man's influence over another they believed but they're scared to tell anybody what they believed because they knew what the Pharisees would do they chop them up and have them for lunch God's not looking for somebody who will operate in cowardice in timidity and fear he's looking for courageous come on yes sir come on that that there's a problem preachers even around this message they choose where they preach because they don't want to do anything to jeopardize another invitation in another place so they have that's why that's why so many of them reach out to me secretly quietly clandestine to tell me they enjoy the services that they stream they can't do it publicly on Facebook they can't do it out there so everybody could see it because it would cut down where they get to pre I'm not interested in partisan politics in the bride church I don't have time for that kind of behavior right if I wanted to cow to that I would hang the pictures in the right place right i' do it like they wanted it done and then we could slide back in I'm not interested in that I'm going to stand for what is right for what the absolute said that's the Bible hello Israel's attention you know this IM let me say it this way the intimidation will cause us to focus on the source of intimidation instead of Jesus who gives us victory over the intimidation Israel's attention was on the giant instead of the Giant Killer the more they focused on the giant the bigger the giant God their focus was an insult to God he could part the Red Sea but couldn't defeat one giant or a host of giants we must take our eyes off of that which is intimidating us and place our eyes on the one who gives us Supreme Victory and deliverance fear and intimidation will keep us from possessing God's promises that have already been given to us do you believe that in the message presuming paragraph 22 brother brandom said Joshua Caleb stealed the people remember this from just a few months ago they said we can't we can't take it we just can't do it that's all see they were looking at the amalekites Joshua and Caleb were looking at the promise so that devil will try to intimidate you get your eyes off the Intimidator don't look to the giant look to the one who gives power to kill the giant and eat him for breakfast amen he said so they're looking them out Joshua and Caleb look at the promise that's a difference depends on what you're looking at Joshua said we're more than able to do it I wish somebody would say we're more than able to do it we're more than able well I said they're only bread for us why they look great they're great we'll have great bread lots of grease good bread God gave us the promise and the fear of us is on them wo while you're busy fearing an intimidating devil I want you to know that devil really deeply fears you not as you are but as he knows what your potential is and every time you push him back he said is this going to be the time is that going to be the time it will be for you one of these days do you believe that when I think of the spirit of intimidation I think of Goliath who cornered God's people in the valley of elah in a critical moment of advancement Goliath shouted taunts and mockery at God's people all day long to intimidate them and stop them in their tracks and guess what it was working 1 Samuel 1710 And1 and the Philistines said I defy the armies of Israel this day give give me a man that we may fight together when Saul and all Israel heard the words of the Philistine they were dismayed and even King Saul greatly what they stopped they gave up the worst thing was that they began believing the things that Goliath was saying three kinds of Believers paragraph 80 and Goliath I'm coming to a close may take me a little bit to get there and Goliath many times larger than he was great big fellow 14in fingers on him now the fingers would be that long see 14inch fingers a warrior and probably the coat of mail that he had on probably weighed 300 lb or more see they had on him a helmet probably the metal an inch and a half thick a great big giant like that walking with a Weaver's needle which is claimed to be around 20 feet long his spear 20 ft long he had a 20 foot spear in his hand boy that's a big old man a man like that could just stand and pick up a dozen man and throw them like that as they come up what an opposition you can't deny he looked like an undefeatable foe but in 1st Samuel 17:26 David entered the scene in the Zeal for the Lord and the spirit of justice that David carried and he said and David spake to the men that stood by him saying what shall be done to the man that kth this Philistine and taketh away the reproach from Israel for who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies the ranks of the Living God woo and we know what happened next he showed up Goliath to be nothing more than just a counterfeit lion and he did it not with a 20 foot spear no with one little Stone in a sling he took Goliath down and did what what did he do after he knocked him down don't let him live no don't you let that Spirit once you identify it once you divorce yourself from it don't you let it hang around your house you get rid of it once and for all cut its head off brother brandom said in what is your in your hand what is that in your hand paragraph 63 picked up these five Stones why this great big boasting Infidel walked out there and cursed him in the name of his Idol cursed David why said I'll take you on the end of my spear which it was like a weaver need a longer than one of them middle tent poles and he said I'll take you on the end of this sphere little old boy weighed about 110 lbs that ain't much if Goliath's armor weighed upward of 300 lbs that means his armor weighed three times what his what his opposition what the only one who'd stand against him weighed come on one man in God it's all it takes one boy in God one surrendered vessel in God one little praying mama in God about 110 lbs kind of scraw he draw it in little old fella maybe didn't get too much to eat back on the back side of the desert but he stayed with God it's the main thing picked him up I'll pick you up on the end of this and I'll hold you up and let the birds eat your flesh this day that's what the devil said watch what David said David said you come to me as a Philistine with an armor and with a spear and in the name of your false god but said I come to you in the name of the Lord God of Israel this day I'll cut off your head and give your flesh to the birds that doesn't sound like a timid boy it doesn't sound like somebody Paralyzed by intimidation and cowardice it sounds like somebody who knew his God who trusted that he was able well I'm afraid I'm afraid to stand up against the en enemy then he'll walk all over you and eat you for a snack you can't let that generational thing rooted in iniquity cause you to put off what must be done you've got to call it out deal with it and cut its life off while you have an opportunity to do it now is the time now is the time one one more maybe two more preparation ens Kentucky why old Goliath was covered all over with steel all up and down like that just one little spot and Harry comes across to meet him a little bitty fellow about like this and Goliath about like that standing there with his spear ready to pick him up and hang him on a tree somewhere here comes a little David listen listen you know how humble they can [Music] be so dignified so churchy so dead they're going to face the enemy you're going to face the enemy like that you're going to teach your people to defeat the enemy like that never never never never never never here come little David was he like this well I've I've seen them said I'm I want to hold my Bible like brother brandom held his Bible you think that's going to do you any good when you face Goliath you think the enem is going to run from your belt buckle you think the enemy is going to run from your bolo tie or your cowboy boots I want you to know he's devoured a thousand just like you come on in the last 20 minutes but you let a little David come he don't have to be fat he don't even have to be mus he just has to be willing here's the key he met the enemy and look what he was doing here come little David just AB bouncing in the spirit what do you think that look like I show it you want to show it don't hurt yourself yeah yeah I I think it look I think it looked little something like that he wasn't cowering he he wasn't trying to decide whether he was going all the way he had confidence I've Got Confidence God's going to see me through no matter what the case may be I know he's going to fix it for me oh what a Holy Roller Victory already Hallelujah why he place the name of the Lord God of Israel oh Jesus thank you Lord thank you Jesus if you and I'll just place the name of the Lord between our lives and the enemy you're going to have to walk over the king of Israel to get to me you dirty circum uncircumcised Philistine I'm putting the name of the Lord I'm putting the word of almighty God between you and I all devils in Hell couldn't wait across that you hear this little David just a what was he doing just a dancing in the spirit like he didn't have a care in the world you'd to never know that he was about to go out and meet what could have been the end of his life because the man on the other end was ready to devour him he wanted to pick him up on the end of his Spear and sling him around further intimidating the whole Army of of Israel But Here Come Little David bouncing in the spirit oh what a holy Roar victory of all devils in Hell couldn't wait Little David just a dancing in the spirit Oh Glory Hallelujah full confidence no timidity not paralyzed by fear and in the me message preparation he said Harry went up there just a dancing in the spirit in case you think that he misspoke and never said it like that again Harry said it earlier Harry went up there dancing in the spirit as hard as he could by Faith by faith he saw the victory amen by faith he saw the victory he took his little sling in there one of these Stones he gave a dance and here he come coming around oh he said I see Goliath ho ho ho ho that's somewhere between Santa Claus and Jack and the beanock ho ho ho what was it he had five Stones f a i t h in five fingers wrapped this string around j s u s here he comes old brother look out Goliath look out Goliath you got to fall and when he set that loose listen listen yes sir and when he set that loose the Holy Ghost got a hold of that little Old Stone I want to look at you you hear what he's saying yes sir sir it wasn't just David's ability to fling it just right my God Jesus was the Victor that day the spirit of almighty God got behind that little Stone and picked up a speed I don't know but brother brandom's guesstimating a th000 miles per second I'm telling you that is like a missile he didn't even know what hit him somebody said what if it wasn't that fast well I don't know how fast it was but I'll tell you this it was fast enough to get the job done right I wasn't there it might have barely made it through the sky to until it got right up to his forehead I don't know and then it may have then it may have been a th000 miles per second all I know is it hit him right where he needed to be hit struck him right between the eyes the face and he fell forward that wasn't the end of the story Little David said you ain't never going to intimidate me or the armies of my God again I'm going to make sure that you understand and that all the Philistines understand this intimidating devil has lost the battle for my family today I'm not afraid of him anymore we're going to win this thing musicians are coming I don't know when we'll ever get through this Psalm 56 in closing verse 1- 11 in the Amplified if you'll put that up there
