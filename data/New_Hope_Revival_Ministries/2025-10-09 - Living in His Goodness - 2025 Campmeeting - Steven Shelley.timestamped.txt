[42:55] &gt;&gt; He invited us into his presence.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; And what a joy it is to be in his
[43:01] presence.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Do you have a need you just like to make
[43:05] known tonight by the lifting of the
[43:07] hand? All over the building, there are
[43:09] hands that are raised.
[43:12] If you have a spok a need that you would
[43:15] like us to say across the pullpit during
[43:18] this meeting, just make sure that
[43:20] perhaps we get it on a piece of paper or
[43:22] through a text. We'd be glad to uh speak
[43:25] that need out loud. There are lots of
[43:27] needs, but there's one thing that I know
[43:30] about my Lord. He knows it before I even
[43:34] ask. And and we as humans, we like to
[43:37] know all the little nitty-gritty details
[43:40] because we're a nosy bunch.
[43:43] &gt;&gt; But my Lord, he already knows the
[43:45] details. And besides knowing the
[43:47] details, he knows how to fix the
[43:49] problem.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; And I'm so thankful that I can take it
[43:53] to my papa and he can handle the
[43:55] situation.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Would you sing this little
[44:00] course sweep over my soul? I'm going to
[44:02] ask brother Hawk to come and pray
[44:04] tonight over these requests. Sweep over
[44:09] my soul.
[44:12] Sweep over
[44:15] my soul.
[44:18] Sweet spirit,
[44:21] sweep over
[44:24] my soul.
[44:29] My rest
[44:32] is complete
[44:35] while I sit
[44:38] at your feet.
[44:40] Sweet spirit,
[44:44] sweep over
[44:46] my soul. Sing once again.
[44:51] Oh, sweep over
[44:54] my soul.
[44:58] Sweep over
[45:00] my soul.
[45:03] Sweet spirit,
[45:06] sweep over
[45:09] my soul.
[45:12] [Music]
[45:14] My rest
[45:17] is complete
[45:20] while I sit
[45:22] at your feet.
[45:26] Sweet spirit
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus. Jesus.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; Lord, I have found
[45:41] &gt;&gt; my favorite place
[45:44] &gt;&gt; in my whole life is to be at your feet.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; It's to sense you.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; It's to feel you. is to recognize your
[45:54] voice within me. Recognize your love
[45:58] towards me.
[46:01] All of us here,
[46:04] we are striving for rest, fighting for
[46:08] rest.
[46:11] But Lord, we want you to find your rest
[46:16] &gt;&gt; in us. That's the word.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; That is your desire. Lord, would you
[46:22] help us to know it
[46:25] &gt;&gt; with a heart knowledge that you want to
[46:29] inhabit your bride? You want to make
[46:32] love with her by your spirit. We were
[46:36] created for you
[46:39] and for your pleasure. It's only in you
[46:43] where we have true satisfaction,
[46:47] true deliverance, true meaning, and true
[46:50] purpose. What a privilege to be redeemed
[46:54] by you, oh king.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; Lord, it's your desire
[47:04] that we would be free.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; That is the reason you came. You wanted
[47:10] to prove to us where we that we would be
[47:14] worth it that you would lay down your
[47:17] own life.
[47:20] Lord, help us to really see what you
[47:23] have already done.
[47:27] You've already done it. May every lie
[47:32] of the enemy be broken in the authority
[47:36] of the Lord Jesus.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. We silence it right now in the
[47:41] name of Jesus. May truth prevail.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Have your way, oh God. Give us the grace
[47:50] to surrender and to say yes.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; We're not asking you just to take the
[47:56] troubles away. We're asking you for the
[47:59] grace and the overcoming anointing
[48:03] &gt;&gt; to win, to overcome for the glory of
[48:06] God. May healing manifest in everybody
[48:10] that needs healing right now.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we just say have your way in
[48:18] this service. Use our brothers for the
[48:21] glory of God. May they yield to the
[48:24] anointing and may your word come forth
[48:27] with power and authority and accomplish
[48:31] what it needs to accomplish in the name
[48:34] of the Lord Jesus. Amen. Before
[48:38] you move, I I want to I don't want to
[48:40] miss this opportunity to say that while
[48:43] we were worshiping the Lord,
[48:46] I began to sense and see that there are
[48:50] old
[48:52] gnarly uh maybe that's not a good word.
[48:55] Uh
[48:57] roots, but but gnarled.
[49:01] Sorry, I I think I said something kind
[49:03] of but but gnarled root old roots.
[49:09] If you have been in the garden of
[49:11] Gethsemane,
[49:12] you would see those olive trees where
[49:16] they have carbonated
[49:19] limbs that have fallen off to be over
[49:22] 2,000 years old.
[49:24] And you can just imagine after being
[49:26] trimmed and trimmed and trimmed and
[49:28] trimmed how how twisted and u you would
[49:32] almost think ugly, but
[49:35] they're not. They're actually very
[49:37] beautiful because out of those old
[49:39] twisted stumps and what's left of a tree
[49:43] right out of the top will be these
[49:45] beautiful olive branches with with
[49:47] beautiful olives right across from
[49:50] Gethsemane.
[49:52] And I saw tonight that some of us have
[49:55] some roots that are so gnarled and so
[49:59] old and so deep that we have become used
[50:04] to our bondage.
[50:07] We we've just become comfortable
[50:10] and we don't even know we're bound
[50:14] because we've been stagnant so long and
[50:17] we have been static so long. But but the
[50:20] Lord, I believe, I know for sure he's
[50:24] more than able
[50:26] &gt;&gt; to lay the root right, the axe right to
[50:29] the root of whatever holds you
[50:33] &gt;&gt; and whatever you keep running back to
[50:37] a and in doing so, you don't even
[50:39] realize really your condition. I don't
[50:43] know if you can relate to that or not,
[50:45] but there are times like the prodigal
[50:48] son, we don't recognize our condition
[50:51] &gt;&gt; until we do
[50:53] &gt;&gt; and our eyes pop open and we say, "Why
[50:56] in the world would I spend another night
[50:59] eating slop
[51:02] &gt;&gt; when my father has more than enough on
[51:06] his table?"
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:10] The prophet preached to us total
[51:13] deliverance.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; And it's been watered down and watered
[51:19] down and watered down in this hour until
[51:22] people are being taught to just accept
[51:25] these kinds of things in their life and
[51:28] just keep loving the Lord and hearing
[51:30] the word and going to church and
[51:33] everything's going to be all right. But
[51:34] that's beautiful. It's even attractive,
[51:37] but it's not what he preached.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; He preached that there was total
[51:43] deliverance available
[51:45] &gt;&gt; that goes right to the root,
[51:49] &gt;&gt; the root of the root
[51:51] &gt;&gt; and begins to grub it out.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said we needed a
[51:57] grubbing hole.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; Go right to the root. Can I just pray?
[52:00] It's not my turn, but can I just pray
[52:03] for you right now? Uh would you would
[52:06] you ask the Lord if if you've got I ask
[52:10] him before I before I interrupted I ask
[52:13] him to show me the places where I may be
[52:16] tethered to this earth.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; I was not born to be a a buzzard you
[52:23] know or a chicken. I was born to fly
[52:27] &gt;&gt; and to soar and so are you. and and may
[52:30] God help us to identify uh old bondages,
[52:35] hurts and wounds.
[52:38] Uh those who wounded us are dead.
[52:40] They're gone. They're not coming back
[52:43] except perhaps in a resurrection.
[52:47] A and yet we are still being affected by
[52:50] those old old things. Uh does it make
[52:54] sense to anybody?
[52:56] I'm having a hard time getting it
[52:58] together, but let me pray. And and if
[53:01] you feel like there's any possibility
[53:04] that there's something old and ugly,
[53:08] gnarled,
[53:10] some root that holds you back that
[53:13] causes you to remain bound
[53:16] and you know the word has come to set
[53:18] you free.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; And you don't want partial deliverance.
[53:21] And you don't want just a little bit of
[53:23] freedom. You don't want just freedom to
[53:25] have emotion or or a chill bump or you
[53:28] you want freedom to live a Christ life.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Father, in the name of Jesus,
[53:35] I didn't want to say anything, but Lord,
[53:38] I believe there's somebody here tonight
[53:41] that will hear this because you don't
[53:44] waste your time with us. You whatever
[53:46] you do, you do for purposes and kingdom
[53:50] advancements. And tonight I ask you,
[53:52] Lord, to turn the search light of your
[53:56] love into the deepest recesses of who we
[53:59] are and show us by your word, by your
[54:02] spirit, by your grace, anything that has
[54:06] not been addressed, anything that we
[54:09] have not properly dealt with by the word
[54:12] and it's affecting us years later, we
[54:16] live under the influence of something so
[54:20] old that it's uh it's just history.
[54:25] Father, I ask tonight that somebody's
[54:28] faith would rise and they would say, "I
[54:32] I I don't want this place anymore. I
[54:35] don't want it in me. I don't want to be
[54:37] tethered to the earth. I don't want to
[54:39] have old roots growing in my life. I
[54:42] want to have forgiveness in my heart.
[54:45] Whether they've asked for it or not,
[54:47] whether they deserve it or not, I want
[54:50] to forgive because you did. Because you
[54:53] said, "Father, forgive them. They don't
[54:56] even know what they're under. THEY DON'T
[54:58] EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. THEY DON'T
[54:59] EVEN KNOW THE SPIRIT THAT THEY CARRY.
[55:03] But Lord, I ask right now that you would
[55:05] help us. That you would help us to let
[55:08] it go, to turn it loose.
[55:10] We want to hear your word tonight. Free
[55:12] enough that it would settle down into us
[55:15] and do for us what we cannot do for
[55:18] ourselves.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Precious Lord, would you just reach your
[55:22] hand to him just another moment? We're
[55:25] not trying to force anything. I just
[55:27] want it off of me so I can enjoy the
[55:30] rest of this service. Lord, we just put
[55:33] our antenna right up and we say none of
[55:36] us are immune. None of us live above
[55:41] having those kinds of things that haunt
[55:44] us,
[55:46] that haunt us.
[55:49] And so Lord, tonight your word has
[55:51] promised us a total deliverance.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; And we want freedom in every area.
[55:58] Lord, if there's anybody in our life
[56:00] that has harmed us and we have not been
[56:02] able to forgive and let it go, would you
[56:04] give us victory as the word comes forth
[56:06] tonight?
[56:09] Oh yes,
[56:10] &gt;&gt; it would be a paradigm shift to us. It
[56:13] would be a total change.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; My goodness, you'd find you feel better
[56:18] physically.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; You you'd find that letting go of those
[56:22] things and having them dealt with by the
[56:24] word at the root. You'd find a freedom
[56:26] and a and a a change of heart and a
[56:29] better attitude.
[56:31] Lord, this is what we want.
[56:34] We don't want to walk around among the
[56:36] bride like we're mad at the whole wide
[56:38] world. Grumpy and and and sour. I'm so
[56:41] tired of sourness.
[56:44] The reality is we've all been through so
[56:46] much stuff. But we can choose this
[56:50] evening to let you do the business. And
[56:53] I start right here, Lord. Start right
[56:55] with me.
[56:57] Start right here, Lord, and go to the
[56:59] root of anything. Show me what it is and
[57:02] I'll get it out. I I'll do my part. I'll
[57:05] participate with you.
[57:09] Lord, let it move over this place.
[57:12] May we prepare our hearts to let it go
[57:14] to be free from it in the precious name.
[57:18] Sorry, brother. The precious name of the
[57:21] Lord Jesus Christ.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:27] Lord, I thank you.
[57:29] I thank you that you created me to be
[57:31] whole,
[57:33] &gt;&gt; healthy
[57:35] &gt;&gt; in the spirit.
[57:38] We bless you and thank you for it, Lord.
[57:42] Hallelujah.
[57:45] Will you give him a great hand clap of
[57:47] praise? One that he's worthy of tonight.
[57:51] Hallelujah.
[57:52] [Music]
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:00] You're worthy, Lord.

[58:20] you're seated tonight.
[58:23] He paid a debt. He did not owe. I owed a
[58:30] debt. I did not pay. I needed someone
[58:37] to wash my sin away.
[58:44] And now I sing a brand new song. Amazing
[58:50] grace all day long. Christ Jesus paid a
[58:57] debt that I could never pay.
[59:02] Once again, he paid a debt he did not
[59:08] owe. I owed a debt I could not pay. I
[59:15] needed someone
[59:18] to wash my sin away.
[59:24] And now I sing a brand new song. Amazing
[59:32] grace. All day long. Christ Jesus paid a
[59:38] debt that I could never pay.

[59:49] debt for you?

[1:04:30] very happy that for the first time he
[1:04:33] spent nine or 10 days in the niku. But

[1:05:05] glad you're home.
[1:05:08] God bless you, Brother John. You got
[1:05:10] one. All right.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; This This is a little intimidating
[1:05:20] after singers like Brother Dwayne here
[1:05:22] and Brother Shelly and Brother Benjamin.
[1:05:23] I tell you, it's uh if I seem nervous,
[1:05:27] you got a revelation real quick.
[1:05:31] But I have been promising, brother Steve
[1:05:32] I was going to get down here for a long
[1:05:34] time. And I have tried, but I kept
[1:05:37] trying till I made it. Amen. So now now
[1:05:40] it's probably going to become a habit.
[1:05:42] But Amen.
[1:05:47] [Music]
[1:05:50] You forgive me, but I always say this
[1:05:52] when I go someplace new and I meet uh a
[1:05:55] portion of the bride. But I I ran a
[1:05:58] luxury limousine service for 25 years.
[1:06:01] And I met a tremendous amount of very
[1:06:04] very famous people that if I called
[1:06:07] their names, everybody would know them.
[1:06:10] Politicians, entertainers, sinners, and
[1:06:12] whatever. And then one the question that
[1:06:15] everybody would ask me, who is the most
[1:06:17] famous person that you've ever had in
[1:06:20] your limousine? And I would come up with
[1:06:22] some name like
[1:06:25] Terry Tedwell
[1:06:29] or some member of the bride and they'd
[1:06:31] say, "Who in the world is that?" I said,
[1:06:34] "You don't know that person. That is
[1:06:37] royalty.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; You should definitely know that person."
[1:06:41] And I'm reminded, brother Dan Daisy said
[1:06:43] one time him and Brother Green were
[1:06:45] standing outside of Buckingham Palace
[1:06:47] and he looked at Brother Green and he
[1:06:49] said, "Brother Henry," he said, "we've
[1:06:51] been standing here for 15 minutes and
[1:06:53] the queen has not invited me in for tea
[1:06:55] yet." He said, "Early royalty standing
[1:06:59] up there looking down here at heavenly
[1:07:02] royalty. You really ought to give
[1:07:04] yourself a hand because you are that
[1:07:07] elite lady, that that royalty today.
[1:07:12] Amen.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; You forgive me. These these musicians
[1:07:16] can cover up my singing and it'll be
[1:07:19] well good. But I love this song because
[1:07:21] I'm just I'm just biting my time until
[1:07:24] he says come up higher. And I'm just
[1:07:26] waiting for that moment. Amen. When all
[1:07:29] gravitation will lose its hold. Amen.
[1:07:31] And we're going to go to meet him in the
[1:07:33] air. Any anybody can identify with that
[1:07:35] today? Amen. Be be flat, brother.
[1:07:41] My heart can sing
[1:07:45] when I pause to remember.
[1:07:52] A heartache here
[1:07:56] is but a step in stone
[1:08:03] along the trail.
[1:08:06] that wind
[1:08:09] always upward.
[1:08:13] This trouble world
[1:08:17] is not my final home.
[1:08:24] But until then,
[1:08:28] my heart will go on singing.
[1:08:35] And until then
[1:08:39] with joy I'll carry on
[1:08:45] until
[1:08:47] the day
[1:08:49] my eyes behold that city
[1:08:56] until the day
[1:09:00] God calls
[1:09:03] me
[1:09:06] [Music]
[1:09:07] The things of earth
[1:09:11] will dim and lose their value.
[1:09:18] If we recall,
[1:09:21] they're only borrowed for a while.
[1:09:29] and the things of earth
[1:09:32] that caused my heart to tremble.
[1:09:38] [Music]
[1:09:40] Remember
[1:09:41] there
[1:09:43] they will only bring a smile.
[1:09:50] God until then
[1:09:54] my heart will go on singing
[1:10:01] and until then
[1:10:06] we jo

[1:10:24] until
[1:10:25] the day

[1:10:31] me home.
[1:10:35] But until then,
[1:10:39] my heart will go on singing.
[1:10:47] until the end
[1:10:50] with joy. I'm going to carry on
[1:10:57] until

[1:15:05] How many of you know it won't be long
[1:15:07] now?
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Your eyes are going to see the city.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; My my my brother brother John and and uh
[1:15:16] his wife and family. Thank you all for
[1:15:18] being here tonight. Um, I stood out on
[1:15:22] the parking lot in Ruth, North Carolina
[1:15:26] 30 plus years ago
[1:15:29] and talked to brother John and brother
[1:15:32] Robby Turner.
[1:15:34] And uh, they encouraged me.
[1:15:39] They they somehow knew what a hard road
[1:15:43] lay ahead for me.
[1:15:46] I don't know how they knew, but I could
[1:15:48] tell by the way they talked to me. They
[1:15:51] knew that my road was about to get hard.
[1:15:54] And I have never forgotten the
[1:15:55] encouragement that they both gave me. It
[1:15:58] had to be 30 years ago. And I more. It
[1:16:01] has to be. Oh, it's been I pas I've
[1:16:04] pastored here 35 years. So, it's about
[1:16:07] 40 years.
[1:16:09] Oh, it's a wonder me and you can get up
[1:16:12] here.
[1:16:19] Brother John had dear friends that are
[1:16:22] that were and will be again when I see
[1:16:24] him again. Dear friends of mine, Brother
[1:16:26] Henry Green, Brother Dan Dasley that he
[1:16:29] mentioned, and Brother Gerald Cleveland.
[1:16:31] He loved you all so very much. And I'm
[1:16:35] very thankful for brother Cleveland and
[1:16:38] his testimony in my life and the the
[1:16:41] courage that he had to introduce me to
[1:16:44] something that was much bigger than I
[1:16:46] realized at the time. Isn't God
[1:16:48] faithful?
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Well, we got to hurry. Although we're
[1:16:51] having I'm having a really really good
[1:16:54] time.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; I was going to say blast, but since I've
[1:16:58] already said a strange word while ago, I
[1:17:00] I won't say it. But uh I feel like
[1:17:03] that's what it is.
[1:17:05] would you uh would you consider uh
[1:17:07] sewing something into this meeting? We
[1:17:09] want the the ministers who will be
[1:17:12] speaking to be blessed and maybe some of
[1:17:15] their expenses defraed. And we also
[1:17:18] recognize that it's cost you to get
[1:17:20] here. And I just pray that the Lord will
[1:17:23] bless you back abundantly again and
[1:17:25] again and again for your giving. We have
[1:17:28] a double header tonight. I know they're
[1:17:30] going to be sensitive to the spirit.
[1:17:32] Brother Joe Ryder is going to come and
[1:17:34] spend some time with us sharing. I said,
[1:17:38] you know, we were expecting brother
[1:17:39] Caleb Duron from Tucson to be here. He
[1:17:43] was flying in today just just before
[1:17:46] midnight last night. He said, "Are you
[1:17:48] available for a call?" Normally, that
[1:17:50] would not be the case, but I happened to
[1:17:53] be still sitting at the table at the
[1:17:55] time. and uh he had something come up
[1:17:58] that was of a serious nature and and uh
[1:18:01] we just released him very quickly
[1:18:03] because I've been there. I've been there
[1:18:06] and and I don't want anyone to be away
[1:18:09] from what what they need to attend to.
[1:18:12] You understand? So, he was going to
[1:18:14] share the evening with brother with
[1:18:15] brother Ryder this evening, but instead
[1:18:18] brother Dwayne will. Well, you say it
[1:18:21] might must be going to take all night.
[1:18:22] Well, let's see if it does. Uh, we've
[1:18:25] come here, we come once a year for this
[1:18:28] and we want the Lord to have his way.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; I mean that.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; I mean that. If you don't mean it, you
[1:18:34] just can slip out when you need to. We
[1:18:37] will just be glad to see you the next
[1:18:39] time you're here. Maybe tomorrow night.
[1:18:41] We better go ahead and warn you that we
[1:18:43] won't be in a hurry then either.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Uh, we don't know how much time we have
[1:18:49] left here. I want to use every bit of it
[1:18:51] to the glory of God. Don't you?
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to ask you to stand
[1:18:55] because you've been standing so long,
[1:18:58] but uh Brother Ellas, how about you
[1:19:00] coming and um Brother uh Ian, you can
[1:19:03] come, too. But stand up here, would you,
[1:19:05] with the bags and and it'll be quicker.
[1:19:08] It can be quicker this way. If you have
[1:19:10] an offering or if you're local and you
[1:19:12] have tithe you want to put in tonight,
[1:19:14] you can certainly do that. Uh last night
[1:19:17] was our regular weekly church service.
[1:19:19] If you don't want to come, well, we have
[1:19:22] dozens of children who love to come. So,
[1:19:26] just hand it to one of them as they pass
[1:19:28] by. Father, we thank you tonight for
[1:19:31] that our hearts have already been
[1:19:33] blessed. We have this strong in
[1:19:36] inspiration that much more is to come.
[1:19:39] We ask tonight that you would bless our
[1:19:42] efforts to sew back into the work. We
[1:19:44] pray that you'll multiply it to the
[1:19:46] giver. Lord, I I want your people to be
[1:19:49] blessed for their faithfulness to you.
[1:19:52] And that's who you are. That's who you
[1:19:54] are. You have given back abundantly to
[1:19:57] your people, pressed down, shaken
[1:19:59] together, and running over. And bless
[1:20:01] these brothers for standing up here
[1:20:03] tonight to receive it. In the precious
[1:20:05] name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray.
[1:20:07] The saints said,
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just a little bit of some
[1:20:11] choruses. Glory. Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:20:13] Something. Let's play something with a
[1:20:15] little pep to it. Uh so they can uh

[1:20:19] time to stretch your legs.

[1:21:07] feeling just like shouting since I laid
[1:21:13] my burden down. Glory.
[1:21:17] [Music]
[1:21:19] Since I laid my burden, you remember.
[1:21:24] Glory, glory,
[1:21:26] hallelujah.
[1:21:28] Since I laid my burden now. Well, I'm
[1:21:33] feeling so much better. Since I lay my
[1:21:39] heavy burden now, now I'm feeling a
[1:21:43] whole lot better.
[1:21:46] Since I laid my burden down, I laid them
[1:21:50] down. Lord, I laid them down at a Holy
[1:21:54] Ghost altar. I laid them down. I laid
[1:21:59] them down, Lord. I laid them down at a
[1:22:03] Holy Ghost altar. I laid them down. I'm
[1:22:07] crying holy, holy unto the Lord. I'm
[1:22:12] crying holy, holy unto the Lord.
[1:22:16] Well, now if I could, I surely would
[1:22:20] stand on that rock where Moses stood.
[1:22:24] I'm crying holy, holy unto the Lord.
[1:22:29] Crying holy, holy unto the Lord.
[1:22:33] Well, now if I could, I surely would
[1:22:38] stand on that rock where Moses stood.
[1:22:42] Well, I'm saved
[1:22:44] and I know that I am. I'm saved and I
[1:22:49] know that I am. I'm saved
[1:22:53] and I know that I am. I'm so glad. I
[1:22:57] know that I am. I'm sanctified
[1:23:02] and I know that I am sanctified
[1:23:06] and I know that I am sanctified.
[1:23:11] And I know that I am. I'm so glad. I
[1:23:14] know that I am Holy Ghost fil.
[1:23:19] And I know
[1:23:21] Holy Ghost fil.
[1:23:24] And I know that I am Holy Ghost fil.
[1:23:28] And I know that I am. I'm so glad. I

[1:23:34] Oh, I'm running trying to make a 100.
[1:23:39] 99 and a half. Won't do. Oh, I'm
[1:23:44] running. Got to make a 100.
[1:23:48] 99 and a half. You got to go all the
[1:23:51] way. It just won't do. Lord, just won't
[1:23:54] do.
[1:23:56] 99 and a half will never do. It just
[1:24:01] won't do. Just won't do.
[1:24:05] 99 and a half. Just won't do.
[1:24:12] Run all the way.
[1:24:15] Run all the way.
[1:24:18] Don't dare slow down now.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Well, it's only shorter to hold the bags
[1:24:26] if you only sing as long as they hold
[1:24:29] the bags. But if you sing another 10
[1:24:32] minutes, it's longer.
[1:24:36] Mathematics, that wasn't my strong point
[1:24:39] in school.
[1:24:41] Uh, would you stand again?
[1:24:43] Brother Joe Ryder has been a I can't
[1:24:46] quite I can't I've never quite been able
[1:24:49] I have really big teeth and I have a
[1:24:52] hard time rolling the R writer
[1:24:56] writers
[1:24:58] but he's been a longtime friend with his
[1:25:02] family
[1:25:04] from South Africa
[1:25:06] and uh they wanted to be here this year
[1:25:09] and we're glad that they're here and I
[1:25:12] ask him to take a portion of the
[1:25:14] service. He said, "I just have a word
[1:25:15] from the Lord and I just want to deliver
[1:25:17] that and that's all I have." Well, do
[1:25:19] you know that's all I want to hear.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; That's what we heard last night.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; It may not have come in the style of
[1:25:30] prophecy, but it was prophetic
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; from the first word
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; to the last word.
[1:25:37] And when brother Greley turned around
[1:25:38] and looked and said, "I didn't know it
[1:25:40] was 10 o'clock." I knew by the look on
[1:25:41] his face that he really meant it.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; I'm glad he didn't.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; I'm glad he didn't know what time it was
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; because we would have missed the tail
[1:25:52] end of it.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; And I've got a feeling that he could
[1:25:55] have he could have rung the rag a little
[1:25:57] tighter tonight and give us some more.
[1:26:00] But what he needs to understand is it
[1:26:03] kept preaching to us.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; It preached to me all night. Every time
[1:26:07] I woke up, I could see those brothers
[1:26:10] lifting those stones up that he had here
[1:26:12] with a illustrated sermon and carrying
[1:26:15] them around.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; And I love the fact that we can all have
[1:26:19] our gifts, our our uniquenesses in
[1:26:22] delivery
[1:26:24] and still be used of God for his his
[1:26:28] little bride. His bride, everybody in
[1:26:29] his bride's not just the same.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; And they receive things differently. And
[1:26:34] children learn, I'm a child. Children
[1:26:36] learn at different levels and with
[1:26:38] different methods.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; So God has just what you need if you're
[1:26:42] open for it. Father, would you use our
[1:26:44] brother
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; as he comes and delivers whatever it is
[1:26:48] that you've placed on his heart for us.
[1:26:50] May there be somebody I will.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; But Lord, let there be somebody else in
[1:26:56] here that'll join me and have a open
[1:26:58] heart full of faith to receive whatever
[1:27:02] it is that you have spoken to. our
[1:27:05] brother on our behalf and we'll give you
[1:27:07] the glory and the praise in the most
[1:27:10] lovely name of Jesus Christ. The saints
[1:27:13] said,
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Beloveds be greeted in the name of our
[1:27:21] Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; I am indeed very thankful to be here.
[1:27:28] This is one of the trips that I felt I
[1:27:31] need to make whether I have
[1:27:35] funds or whether I do not have funds.
[1:27:39] I don't have a sermon here for you
[1:27:41] tonight,
[1:27:44] but I firmly believe it is a prophetic
[1:27:46] time that we live in.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; It's a time that we need to acknowledge
[1:27:51] this the hour and the season that we are
[1:27:54] in.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Hold it up.
[1:28:00] But I want you to as you stand this
[1:28:02] night, I actually want to get into it,
[1:28:07] I want you to turn to
[1:28:10] the book of Revelation,
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; chapter 18.
[1:28:16] And there's many great sermons
[1:28:20] around this
[1:28:25] chapter.
[1:28:30] But I want to speak tonight.
[1:28:34] I want to deliver a message tonight
[1:28:41] around this chapter.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 18 verse one.
[1:28:52] And after these things, I saw another
[1:28:55] another angel come down
[1:28:58] from heaven,
[1:29:01] having great power,
[1:29:04] and the earth was lightened
[1:29:07] with his glory.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Verse two. And he cried mightily with a
[1:29:13] strong voice,
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; saying,
[1:29:16] Babylon the great is fallen.
[1:29:23] And he repeats it. He's fallen.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; And he's become
[1:29:30] the habitation of devils.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; And the hold of every foul spirit
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; and a cage of every unclean
[1:29:44] and hateful bird.
[1:29:48] Verse
[1:29:51] three says, "For all nations have drunk
[1:29:55] of the wine of the wrath of her
[1:29:58] fornication."
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; And the earth and the kings of the earth
[1:30:05] have committed fornication
[1:30:08] with her.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[1:30:11] and the merchants of the earth are wax
[1:30:14] rich
[1:30:16] through the abundance of her delicacies.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Verse four says,
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; "And I heard another voice
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; from heaven saying,
[1:30:30] come out of her,
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; my people."
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:37] And here is the warning.
[1:30:40] That you may not
[1:30:42] and that ye be not partakers
[1:30:47] of her sins.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, Lord.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; And that ye
[1:30:53] receive
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; not
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; of her plagues.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; God bless
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; the reading
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; of his word. Let's bow our heads.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; God, I pray tonight.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Precious Lord.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; I pray God that you will just meet us,
[1:31:15] Lord.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; I pray God, let me just speak
[1:31:23] the way you've summons me to speak.
[1:31:26] Lord,
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; hide me in your word, Lord.
[1:31:31] Clothe me with your word.
[1:31:34] And Lord, let us receive
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; the word in in the manner in which you
[1:31:40] have given it. God bless the reading of
[1:31:44] his word.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:31:51] There's a voice
[1:31:55] that calls
[1:31:59] his bride
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; to come out of her.
[1:32:04] heard it.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; There's a voice and there is many voices
[1:32:10] in this hour.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; That we hear.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; We are in a season of many voices.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; We're in a season where the voices are
[1:32:26] conflicting.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:31] We live in a season
[1:32:33] of a lot of fake messages.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; James 2 verse 19 says
[1:32:45] THE DEVIL ALSO believe
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; and treble tremble.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; I want to SAY TO YOU THE DEVIL ALSO HAS
[1:32:55] A QUOTE
[1:33:01] WE LIVE IN A SEASON WHERE MANY'S GOT A
[1:33:04] QUOTE.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; MANY HAS EMBRACED A QUOTE.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; The devil
[1:33:18] also has a quote
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; and he knows the scriptures.
[1:33:28] But you see over the years
[1:33:30] I want to help
[1:33:32] the young people this morning this
[1:33:35] evening
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; amidst all these voices. How do we
[1:33:42] discern
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; the true voice of God?
[1:33:52] A lesson TAUGHT TO ME WHEN I WAS VERY
[1:33:54] YOUNG.
[1:33:58] How do I discern
[1:34:00] what God is saying?
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; We are challenged.
[1:34:12] THE ONE SAYS I'M FROM PETER. THE OTHER
[1:34:15] ONE SAYS I AM FROM PAUL.
[1:34:19] Who is right?
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Peter or Paul,
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; same message,
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; same season,
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; but we still feel conflicted.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; How do I discern?
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; What is God saying to me? Amen.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; We live in a season where people run
[1:34:46] after every voice.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; WE LIVE IN A SEASON WHERE EVERYBODY SAYS
[1:34:54] LIKE THE PRO LIKE I THINK IT'S ISAIAH
[1:34:58] SAYS HE SAYS IN THAT DAY ONE WOMAN will
[1:35:02] will get HOLD OF SEVEN MEN AND SAYS JUST
[1:35:06] give me your name.
[1:35:10] backwards.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Seven women just backwards.
[1:35:15] Absolutely.
[1:35:17] But how do we
[1:35:20] discern
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; what is God saying?
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; We got to we GOT TO BE ABLE TO HELP THIS
[1:35:31] GENERATION.
[1:35:37] We got to help. It's going to become
[1:35:40] more difficult
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; because the truth
[1:35:47] has been twisted in the season.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; WE LIVE IN A SEASON WHERE SOMEBODY JUST
[1:35:58] FIND ONE LINE OF A QUOTE AND HE RUNS
[1:36:02] with that quote.
[1:36:05] AND NOT FINDING THE CONTEXT of that
[1:36:08] quote
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; 100% pastor
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; the highest order is the is the absolute
[1:36:20] which is the word of the lord
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; gideon IN JUDGES 6 VERSE 37
[1:36:33] This man
[1:36:37] he got TO TEST.
[1:36:39] THE BIBLE SAYS, "BEHOLD, I WILL PUT OUT
[1:36:43] I'LL PUT A FLEECE OF WOOL in the floor.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; And if the dew be on the fleece only,
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; and it be dry upon all upon all the
[1:36:54] earth beside, then shall I know."
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; You got to put out the fleas.
[1:37:02] YOU CANNOT RUN AFTER EVERY QUOTE, after
[1:37:05] every word that you hear.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; But St. Paul comes in 2 Corinthians
[1:37:15] chapter 13 and he says, "In the mouth of
[1:37:19] two or three witnesses
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; shall every word be established."
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; You got to test it.
[1:37:32] JOHN WENT ON IN IN 1 JOHN 4:1, HE SAID,
[1:37:35] "BELOVED,
[1:37:37] BELIEVE NOT EVERY SPIRIT, BUT TRY THE
[1:37:40] SPIRITS
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; WHETHER they are of God,
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; because many false prophets
[1:37:49] are gone out into the world."
[1:37:52] Yes sir.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; First Thessalonians Thessalonians verse
[1:37:58] 5 chapter 5 verse 21 says prove
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; all things.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; We got to be able to test
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; the word.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; This brings me TO THE MESSAGE WHAT I
[1:38:17] want to share with you this this day.
[1:38:23] Now it comes against John Job 33:15 and
[1:38:28] 17. If somebody in here doubts
[1:38:32] how God speaks to us,
[1:38:37] Job 33:15,
[1:38:40] in a dream,
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; in a vision of the night, when deep
[1:38:44] sleep fallth upon men,
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; in slumberings upon the bed, Yes. Yes.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; THEN HE OPENED THE EYES of men and
[1:38:54] sealth their instruction that he may
[1:38:58] withdraw from his purpose and hide from
[1:39:03] man.
[1:39:06] Few
[1:39:09] months ago,
[1:39:13] God gave me a dream
[1:39:18] and it's against this background
[1:39:21] and I want to share this dream with you.
[1:39:25] It was about a dead a dead woman.
[1:39:29] The dream evolves revolves around a
[1:39:32] woman's passing.
[1:39:35] I found myself in a room where I
[1:39:38] witnessed a death.
[1:39:41] However, the issue wasn't a demise
[1:39:45] itself,
[1:39:47] but rather the men that had oversight
[1:39:50] over this body handling of the
[1:39:53] situation.
[1:39:57] They went to great lengths to conceal
[1:40:00] her death,
[1:40:02] FEARING THAT OTHERS
[1:40:05] who discover
[1:40:06] the truth.
[1:40:09] I WATCH IN DISMAY AS THEY ATTEMPTED to
[1:40:13] distort reality,
[1:40:15] APPLYING MAKEUP
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; and painting A FACE IN A FUTILE EFFORT
[1:40:22] to make her appear alive.
[1:40:26] When this APPROACH FAILED, THEY RESORTED
[1:40:30] TO ALL FURTHER desperate measures to
[1:40:33] present her as if she were still alive.
[1:40:40] What saddened me the most in this dream
[1:40:45] and I was so emotional when I saw this
[1:40:50] was that these men were aware that the
[1:40:54] reviving of this body was impossible.
[1:40:59] Yet
[1:41:01] they persisted
[1:41:03] in their futile
[1:41:05] endeavors.
[1:41:10] Beloveds, it's dead.
[1:41:16] It is dead. AND I WANT TO BRING YOU
[1:41:18] BACK.
[1:41:19] In 1962,
[1:41:24] A SERMON BY OUR PROPHET CAME OUT. WHY
[1:41:27] I'M AGAINST organized religion.
[1:41:31] [Music]
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; I wasn't born YET AT THAT TIME.
[1:41:38] SOME OF YOU MAY BE ALIVE WHEN YOU HEARD
[1:41:40] WHEN HE PREACHED THIS message
[1:41:46] and he challenged every historian and he
[1:41:49] said I want to ask any historian here
[1:41:54] present now or on it on its or it's on
[1:41:58] tapes come to come show me at any time
[1:42:04] that men organize a church.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; HE DIED RIGHT THERE AND NEVER did rise
[1:42:11] again.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Beloveds, I I want you to be able to
[1:42:22] understand
[1:42:26] the very same thing. Think about it.
[1:42:31] through his sermons, HE WENT AT LENGTHS
[1:42:34] OF HOW WE'VE BEEN RIDICULED, how we've
[1:42:37] been ridiculed, HOW WE'VE BEEN THROWN
[1:42:40] OUT of churches because of the name of
[1:42:43] Jesus.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; But how have we become so organized?
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; HOW HAVE WE BECOME SO LABEL FOCUSED?
[1:43:01] How have we become so protected?
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; The danger is coming. Benjamin, the
[1:43:09] danger is coming.
[1:43:13] Revelation 18
[1:43:17] speaks about this. I want to be able to
[1:43:20] in that same sermon,
[1:43:23] I want to to be able to to to draw you
[1:43:27] to the attention Yes,
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; just look at
[1:43:35] this quote.
[1:43:39] And he turns to the brand tabernacle.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Now I want to ask you something
[1:43:47] and he became
[1:43:50] he he become more closer home.
[1:43:53] He's not talking to the Pentecostals out
[1:43:55] there. He's not talking to the
[1:43:57] Presbyterians out there.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; He's not talking to the meth Methodist.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; He comes closer.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to ask you something.
[1:44:10] You're fixing to grow into a big
[1:44:12] tabernacle now.
[1:44:15] I may be away for a while.
[1:44:19] I may go somewhere.
[1:44:21] Hard to tell where the Lord will call
[1:44:24] me. maybe of the scene,
[1:44:28] maybe back into the field, maybe he
[1:44:30] might call me into the wilderness.
[1:44:33] I don't know where he will call me till
[1:44:36] Jesus comes.
[1:44:39] I want to ask you something. Did I ever
[1:44:42] ask you for anything? And the
[1:44:45] congregation says no.
[1:44:47] Did I ever back you for money? No.
[1:44:52] Did I ever tell you anything of THE
[1:44:54] THOUSANDS OF THINGS THAT I'VE TOLD you
[1:44:57] in the name of the Lord but didn't come
[1:44:59] to pass? Amen.
[1:45:03] Then don't never join
[1:45:07] an organization.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; I wish he could have added.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; Don't ever become an organization.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; IT'S AGAINST THE WORD OF GOD. AMEN.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Come out of it of of it
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; if you're in it
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; and be separate
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; and receive the word of the Lord.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:38] I believe that
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; while I was worshiping here this
[1:45:42] tonight,
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; I want to say to you, positioning is
[1:45:47] key.
[1:45:49] To be positioned is key.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Some of you can't grow. And I'm not just
[1:45:58] speaking to this assembly. I know
[1:46:00] there's a body of people that is
[1:46:02] listening. Uh-huh.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; You can't enter into the promise.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; you can't receive.
[1:46:11] People's positioning is key.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; Pastor Shia was in grade once, six years
[1:46:20] old.
[1:46:22] And nanny, I learned a great lesson from
[1:46:24] my from my late grandmother.
[1:46:28] I come from school.
[1:46:32] She looked at this plant.
[1:46:36] She said to me, "Joe, move, Joe." She
[1:46:38] said to me, "Joseph, move this plant.
[1:46:44] HE MAY LOOK GREEN, BUT HE WILL never
[1:46:46] bloom. Whilst he's positioned here,
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; YOU'LL NEVER SEE A FLOWER WHILE HE'S
[1:46:54] HERE. HE MIGHT BE GREEN, BUT YOU'LL
[1:46:56] NEVER SEE THAT THIS THIS PLANT WILL EVER
[1:47:01] HAVE A FLOWER.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; One of the biggest lessons I've learned,
[1:47:09] Revelations 18 speaks about, let me tell
[1:47:12] you now, it's it's a great warning.
[1:47:15] Amen.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; In Africans, WE SAY
[1:47:26] MY DUTCH LADIES WILL KNOW WHAT I'M
[1:47:28] TALKING ABOUT.
[1:47:31] What it means?
[1:47:34] It means
[1:47:37] a avoid where the plagues fall.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; Avoid.
[1:47:48] HERE'S YOUR HERE'S OUR challenge
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; because judgment
[1:47:54] is eminent.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; That's right. ABSOLUTELY.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; THE GREAT BABYLON IS ABOUT IS IS is in
[1:48:03] the process of falling.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; You better get come out of it.
[1:48:15] Don't just put your name. It's quite
[1:48:17] easy to sign up.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; They send you a Google form. They send
[1:48:24] you anything and you sign up.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; If you're positioned
[1:48:36] with the plagues,
[1:48:39] you're going to be a partaker of the
[1:48:41] plagues.
[1:48:45] You're going to exactly receive
[1:48:49] the pains,
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; the punishment,
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; the fruit
[1:48:57] of that positioning,
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; You got to come out of it.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; You got to come out of it.
[1:49:10] YOU CANNOT ORGANIZE YOURSELF. YOU CANNOT
[1:49:13] BE POSITIONED in the same manner because
[1:49:16] God's got a position AGAINST IT. THAT'S
[1:49:19] WHY I'm here TO SOUND THE ALARM TO COME
[1:49:22] OUT OF HER. DO NOT BE ASSOCIATED WITH
[1:49:24] HER.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; SHE'S ABOUT TO RECEIVE
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; HER REWARDS.
[1:49:34] I wish I had more time,
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; but it's time.
[1:49:40] Pastor Shel was saying Abram interceded
[1:49:46] for Lot.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you now, the evangelism has
[1:49:54] become for us TO CALL OUR FAMILIES OUT
[1:49:58] OF THEM.
[1:50:02] THE EVANGELIST HAS become to to to bring
[1:50:06] people that was exposed to the truth
[1:50:09] THAT HEARD THIS MESSAGE, COME OUT OF HER
[1:50:11] TO TELL THEM, "LEAVE YOUR STUFF. GET OUT
[1:50:14] OF IT. YOU'RE GOING TO RECEIVE YOUR
[1:50:16] REWARDS."
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; Look at just what Luke 17:E1
[1:50:22] Luke 17 verse 28 says. Likewise
[1:50:27] also as it was in the days of Lot,
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; they did eat,
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; they drank,
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; they bought, THEY SOLD, THEY PLANTED,
[1:50:40] THEY BUILD IT.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; BUT THE SAME DAY
[1:50:44] that Lot went out of Sodom,
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; IT RAINED FIRE AND BRIMSTONE.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; You got to come out of it. That's right.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; Lot had to move.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; You got to get out of her.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Revelation. If you see the seven themes
[1:51:08] that emerge out of that
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; and I will not be able to tell you to
[1:51:14] TALK YOU THROUGH ALL OF THEM TONIGHT.
[1:51:18] But the first ONE IS BABYLON HAS FALLEN
[1:51:20] HAS BECOME A HABITAT A HABITAT OF
[1:51:24] DEVILS.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; I want to give you this portion of
[1:51:32] scripture.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; If you can turn to Jeremiah 7 verse 10
[1:51:38] and 11 in the amplified version. If you
[1:51:41] want to know how a safe a safe house
[1:51:44] looks,
[1:51:47] this is what has become
[1:51:50] which used to be the house of the Lord.
[1:51:54] HAS BECOME A SAFE HOUSE,
[1:51:58] HAS BECOME A PLACE OF RETREAT,
[1:52:02] a place to protect sinful deeds.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; I protect you. you protect me and we
[1:52:12] don't tell nobody that we are doing this
[1:52:14] thing.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; We don't even mind coming to THE PULLPIT
[1:52:22] THAT WE'VE SET ASIDE FOR GOD.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; GO AHEAD.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; THIS PULLPIT BELONGS TO TO GOD. THIS IS
[1:52:29] WHERE WHERE HE SENDS off his work from
[1:52:32] here. And we don't even have respect for
[1:52:34] the pulpit of the Lord.
[1:52:39] But I'm not going to bring justice to
[1:52:41] this portion of scripture. I I want to
[1:52:43] read it to you so that you can
[1:52:44] understand. And Jeremiah prophesied and
[1:52:47] he says in verse 10 and he says, "And
[1:52:49] then dare to come and stand before me in
[1:52:53] this house which is called by my name
[1:52:57] and say we are protected and set free BY
[1:53:03] THIS ACT OF RELIGIOUS ritual only to go
[1:53:06] on with this wickedness and these
[1:53:10] disgusting and loathome things.
[1:53:14] Has this house which is called by my
[1:53:17] name become a den of robbers in your
[1:53:21] eyes? A place of retreat
[1:53:25] for you between acts of violence.
[1:53:29] Behold,
[1:53:31] I myself have seen it, says the Lord.
[1:53:40] Beloveds, the hour is serious.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; It has become serious.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; This is where you see the danger is
[1:53:53] the rewards of being a partaker.
[1:53:57] SILENCE
[1:53:59] BY YOU REMAINING SILENT ON THINGS that
[1:54:03] you got to open your mouths make you a
[1:54:05] partaker of that sin.
[1:54:11] And you see corporately
[1:54:14] this great Babylon has corporately
[1:54:17] sinned against God.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; This this this great Babylon which which
[1:54:25] is the house OF GOD WHICH STARTED OFF
[1:54:28] NOY.
[1:54:29] He said, "Sir,
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; they started off well,
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; but then
[1:54:38] they started to lose it.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; If I go back to that dream,
[1:54:45] I can tell you now, if you go back to
[1:54:48] the dream, we try to be able, we know
[1:54:53] that woman is dead.
[1:54:59] You can speak to many pastors.
[1:55:02] You can speak to many leaders. You can
[1:55:04] speak to many congregations.
[1:55:07] If they are truthful with their
[1:55:08] assemblies, they will tell you
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; there is nothing for you here.
[1:55:15] Come on now.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; YOU LIE AT THAT AT AT AT at the bath of
[1:55:21] uh of BETHESDA AND YOU WAITING AND YOU
[1:55:24] KNOW THERE IS NOTHING for you in there
[1:55:29] and they also know.
[1:55:33] But the delicacies
[1:55:35] the business case.
[1:55:39] You see, church has got a many churches
[1:55:43] got a business case.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; You feel we've become rich. We've become
[1:55:51] wealthy.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; But the prophet,
[1:55:58] he turned to us
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; and he says, "Please don't join. Don't
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; whatever you do.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Come out of her.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; We got to come out of her.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; You got to be Here's the problem.
[1:56:18] You will never GET INTO THAT PLACE
[1:56:21] BECAUSE THAT PLACE IS DOOMED.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; That place
[1:56:29] GOT ALREADY HIS JUDGMENT OVER IT.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; And no matter Let me tell you now,
[1:56:38] you can change your worship. You can
[1:56:40] change
[1:56:42] your sound system.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; You can change
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; the way. You can bring in new people.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; You can try to be able to organize and
[1:56:53] you can do whatever you do.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; If it's dead, it's dead.
[1:57:05] Let me tell you now, I'm I I don't I I
[1:57:08] have I've never been fooled
[1:57:12] by our wonderful people. I can tell you
[1:57:14] now in this world, I I I met a musician.
[1:57:19] He's he's one of the greatest pianists
[1:57:21] in South Africa. And he says to me, "You
[1:57:24] know what? If I want people to cry, I
[1:57:26] know exactly what key to play.
[1:57:34] I come out of an era
[1:57:37] where I didn't need a song to get me
[1:57:40] into the Holy Spirit.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; We've been fooled. We've been fooled.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; I tend to think and it's wonderful. I
[1:57:54] can tell you now. I Benjamin I so enjoy
[1:57:57] the worship because I can see you give
[1:58:00] yourself.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; You give yourself
[1:58:07] we we do have people last night they
[1:58:10] played
[1:58:12] in a lounge they last night they played
[1:58:14] in a club.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; Exactly right.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; And they tend to think it is just by
[1:58:23] getting onto the stage.
[1:58:25] going to church.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; It has become a robber's den.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; It has become
[1:58:38] we even now get into a position where we
[1:58:41] actually says I'm no longer playing for
[1:58:44] free.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; We want money because the delicacies
[1:58:55] the delicacies,
[1:58:57] the business case,
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; the merchants,
[1:59:02] those that is looking at this and you
[1:59:05] know what the charismatic has mastered
[1:59:09] the art. Yes.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; The business case is is they know
[1:59:17] exactly if if I get 5,000 people in this
[1:59:21] auditorium AND ON AVERAGE EVERYBODY JUST
[1:59:24] GIVE ONE $10.
[1:59:27] That's why you'll see
[1:59:30] look what has happened with our
[1:59:31] services. When I started when when I
[1:59:34] came to Christ
[1:59:36] 4 hours 6 hours in a service
[1:59:39] was not a problem.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; No one left.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; But just look how they do it nowadays.
[1:59:51] If I can fit in three services in the
[1:59:54] morning
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; because it's not about it's not about
[2:00:00] the word.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; No,
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; it's about
[2:00:05] the trading.
[2:00:07] It's about the merchant case.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you now, we are not excused.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; We are not excused
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE THAT WE'VE RECEIVED in 62.
[2:00:25] THE MESSAGE THAT WE'VE HEARD IN 58.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; He warns us.
[2:00:35] True.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; And God is reminding us here tonight
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; that woman is dead.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Come out of her.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; Wish I had long more time.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; The rewards.
[2:00:57] Here's your dilemma.
[2:01:01] People receive. Let me tell you now. If
[2:01:04] you've been positioned wrongly,
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; if you've been placed in a in an
[2:01:11] organization where there is happening
[2:01:14] sin,
[2:01:16] that's why be careful who lay their hand
[2:01:19] their hands on you.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; The transfer
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; sir,
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; don't just run to every uh h uh uh
[2:01:32] event,
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:01:34] and let anybody lay your hands upon you.
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; You know your pastor.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; You know your leadership.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; You will get from that con convention
[2:01:52] and you'll feel why you looking
[2:01:54] differently at that woman and why you
[2:01:56] looking differently at that man.
[2:02:01] You will come in here and it was all
[2:02:04] along okay.
[2:02:07] You will find all of a sudden
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; mistakes here
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; because you've picked up
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; a wrong spirit.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; Because you've been wrongly positioned.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; You've become a partaker
[2:02:26] of the sins that is happening there.
[2:02:28] Right.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; Few years back I heard a message from
[2:02:32] the pullpit.
[2:02:34] Come out of THE CAVE OF ABDULLAH.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; GOD HAD TO CALL DAVID OUT OF THE CAVE OF
[2:02:40] ABDULLAM BECAUSE IN THAT CAVE WAS
[2:02:42] DISTRESS, DEBT AND DISCONTENTMENT.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; AND AS LONG AS DAVID WAS IN THAT IN THAT
[2:02:50] CAVE, HE FELT DISCONTENTED. HE FELT FULL
[2:02:54] OF DEBT. HE FELT HE FELT DISMAYED
[2:02:56] because he was wrongly positioned.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; I don't even want to talk tonight about
[2:03:08] fornication
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; because fornication speak exactly about
[2:03:13] misrepresentation.
[2:03:16] That's right.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; And this TEACHER OF THIS HOUSE TAUGHT ME
[2:03:22] what the difference is between adultery
[2:03:25] and fornication.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; Because fornication
[2:03:35] is about misrepresentation.
[2:03:37] What you see they misrepresent.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; A BODY THAT IS DEAD AND IT LOOKS ALIVE.
[2:03:46] Don't be alarmed with what you see on
[2:03:48] YouTube and on Tik Tok and all of these
[2:03:51] things.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; The older people says to us, just
[2:03:56] scratch beneath the surface and YOU'LL
[2:03:59] FIND THE DEVIL'S IS UNDERNEATH THAT.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; The hour is late.
[2:04:10] The hour has become so late.
[2:04:13] It has become so late.
[2:04:16] I cannot just sign up my name. I cannot
[2:04:19] just be in connected to anybody
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; or subscribe.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; God has called his pride out of it.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; God has called us out of her. God wants
[2:04:37] to be able to make sure you see what
[2:04:40] we've seen last night here is the
[2:04:42] calling out of a new generation.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; I don't know if the young people the
[2:04:50] youngsters REALIZE WHAT PROPHETICALLY
[2:04:53] HAS HAPPENED HERE TONIGHT last night in
[2:04:56] this place.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; It speaks about your positioning to go
[2:05:01] and possess.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; BUT HERE'S YOUR PROBLEM. IF YOU ARE
[2:05:06] WRONGLY ALIGNED, you're going to miss
[2:05:08] it.
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you now. Why did those men
[2:05:16] of war died IN THE DESERT?
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; THEY DIED BECAUSE of unbelief. God knows
[2:05:23] you believe. The the prophet, he taught
[2:05:26] us an old song. Only believe.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:05:32] Let me tell you now, Mark 16. The first
[2:05:35] time I heard it, Pastor Shelly, Mark 16.
[2:05:40] Somebody quoted that scripture to me,
[2:05:43] but I caught the last portion.
[2:05:47] And we don't preach that.
[2:05:50] He says, "If you believe,
[2:05:53] if you believe,
[2:05:55] these signs shall follow.
[2:06:00] You shall speak in new tongues. YOU
[2:06:02] SHALL LAY YOUR HANDS UPON THE SICK and
[2:06:04] they shall be healed.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; That is your promise.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; That's why I can't look at those
[2:06:19] those heel of what did you say, brother?
[2:06:21] Brother Wes, last night
[2:06:25] they the heel of the four skins.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, yes.
[2:06:29] There's a greater promise.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; There's a greater promise.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; Many of us has missed it.
[2:06:43] Think about it.
[2:06:46] Where should we have been
[2:06:48] from the 60s till now if we've just
[2:06:53] embraced it?
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; If we've just caught on.
[2:06:58] if we've just instead of just embracing
[2:07:02] the quote. But you see it's it's it it
[2:07:05] is about
[2:07:07] taking that quote and says Lord I want
[2:07:09] to own this. I want this word not just
[2:07:13] to become a word but it MUST BECOME AN
[2:07:15] INSPIRED WORD IN my life.
[2:07:18] [Applause]
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:22] We got to be able to MAKE SURE THAT THE
[2:07:26] WORD IS VESTED IN US.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; I want to encourage the young people. I
[2:07:32] can tell you now, I did not rest because
[2:07:36] I wanted to see those signs and I saw
[2:07:39] that signs.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:45] And you see, no matter where you go,
[2:07:48] if you've been if you've been called out
[2:07:52] by God,
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; his signs will be demonstrated through
[2:07:59] your lives.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, Pastor Shelly,
[2:08:07] I was 10 years old.
[2:08:11] We I grew up in the Protestant church
[2:08:15] where they baptize sprinkles
[2:08:22] and my mother's brother's
[2:08:25] wife
[2:08:27] started to come and live on this. My
[2:08:30] grand my my grandfather had a farm and
[2:08:33] on these farms all the families will
[2:08:35] live will each have their own cottage
[2:08:38] etc.
[2:08:40] And
[2:08:43] when they came to come and live there,
[2:08:44] they realized that this children was not
[2:08:47] been baptized.
[2:08:52] And as traditionally what will happen,
[2:08:54] they will place pressure on the family
[2:08:56] by saying if this children dies,
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; some of you can relate to that. That's
[2:09:04] the only reason why they will number
[2:09:06] push number one push you to have holy
[2:09:09] communion and to be able to have to to
[2:09:12] be baptized because that was the message
[2:09:14] been preached to people
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; and I'm 10 years old.
[2:09:22] My aunt bring her two children.
[2:09:27] They were my my cousins. One was 10 and
[2:09:30] the other one was 11.
[2:09:33] Pastor Shel, I've never heard tongues in
[2:09:36] my life. I didn't know what it was at
[2:09:40] the time because my parents
[2:09:42] because the I'm talking about a period
[2:09:45] where Pentecost was a set.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; Is that the right word that I'm using
[2:09:49] there?
[2:09:53] And
[2:09:56] she came up.
[2:09:59] When she got there, Pastor Shelly,
[2:10:03] this woman went off in a tongue. But I
[2:10:06] knew even then,
[2:10:08] this is God.
[2:10:12] I knew when I heard it, I said, I want I
[2:10:15] want that.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; I knew that is something.
[2:10:22] No choruses was played, no music.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit do not need a a song.
[2:10:29] The Holy Spirit do not need a music uh
[2:10:32] line. The Holy Spirit doesn't need the a
[2:10:36] specific envi a specific environment
[2:10:38] that you need to create.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:10:44] And the spirit fell on her.
[2:10:47] After church, I went to my mom. She went
[2:10:50] on most probably. She disturbed the they
[2:10:53] said she disturbed the church.
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; Because it was approximately she went on
[2:11:01] for 10 minutes in tongues.
[2:11:06] I went to my mom. I said, "Mom, what
[2:11:08] went on?" She said, "Don't worry about
[2:11:10] that. I think that woman was just crazy.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; She didn't wanted the children to be
[2:11:15] baptized, but they never told told us
[2:11:22] a year later they had another child.
[2:11:25] Same thing happened.
[2:11:29] Woman went off in tongues
[2:11:32] up until today.
[2:11:34] Only now when I look back,
[2:11:38] I started to realize
[2:11:42] positioning is key.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; Position is key for you.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; There's a flip side to that.
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; There's a flip side to that.
[2:11:58] You may most probably consider
[2:12:01] most probably becoming tired of this
[2:12:03] type of of of of service. Most probably
[2:12:06] tired of being in an environment like
[2:12:09] this.
[2:12:12] Don't miss your opportunity.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; I want to close off
[2:12:20] Nicodemus.
[2:12:22] He knew
[2:12:25] Nicodemus
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; knew
[2:12:30] but it was stored.
[2:12:33] He was called out.
[2:12:37] Christ called him out.
[2:12:41] He said if you
[2:12:44] wants to become a new man, you got to be
[2:12:46] baptized.
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. He said to him, "YOU BETTER COME
[2:12:52] OUT OF HER."
[2:12:56] But it was still hard
[2:12:59] because he had to weigh up.
[2:13:02] This is how I've been reared. This is
[2:13:05] what I've been exposed to. This is what
[2:13:07] how I've received it.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; This is how we to be.
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; You cannot place God in a box.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit you can't place in a
[2:13:17] box.
[2:13:21] The same spirit that worked in the days
[2:13:24] of William Brandham is the same spirit
[2:13:26] that can work today.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; Don't place God in a box.
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; Don't put the Holy Spirit in a box.
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; I want you to be able to see tonight
[2:13:44] God is calling us out. Amen.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; Pastor Shelly, the message is serious.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; We got to be able to watch oursel as as
[2:13:56] men that is leading a flock.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; We got to be we got to be
[2:14:07] monitor and to be able to say, "Lord,
[2:14:09] let me align ourselves with you.
[2:14:14] [Music]
[2:14:19] Most I think I I did what I had to do.
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; I did what I had to do. But Dwayne,
[2:14:26] &gt;&gt; I know I've said so much. I'm not so
[2:14:28] sure if you're going to sing for us or
[2:14:30] what.
[2:14:32] You've got to be able to do so.
[2:14:43] [Applause]
[2:14:46] I believe it.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; I believe it. Now we're coming out
[2:14:52] again.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; Could the musicians come back for just a
[2:15:00] moment, please?
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; What a word.
[2:15:07] What a word.
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; Praise his wonderful name.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; I truly count it an honor to be with you
[2:15:24] this evening.
[2:15:29] It's an awesome place to stand in front
[2:15:31] of the bride of Christ. That's
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; right. Awesome place to stand right
[2:15:37] here. If you know the song this evening,
[2:15:40] would you sing it with me?
[2:15:45] [Music]
[2:15:48] The gulf that separated
[2:15:51] [Music]
[2:15:53] me
[2:15:55] from Christ my Lord.
[2:15:58] [Music]
[2:16:03] It was so vast. The crossing
[2:16:08] I could never
[2:16:11] go.
[2:16:17] From where I was to his
[2:16:22] domain,
[2:16:24] it seemed
[2:16:26] so far.
[2:16:29] [Music]
[2:16:32] I cried, "Dear Lord,
[2:16:35] I cannot
[2:16:37] come to where
[2:16:40] you are."
[2:16:46] He came
[2:16:48] to me.
[2:16:53] He came
[2:16:55] to me.
[2:16:58] [Music]
[2:17:00] When I couldn't come to where he was,
[2:17:08] he came to me.
[2:17:13] [Music]
[2:17:14] That's why he died
[2:17:22] on Calary.
[2:17:29] When I couldn't come to where
[2:17:35] he was,
[2:17:37] he came to me.
[2:17:45] He came to me when I was bound
[2:17:52] in chains of sin.
[2:17:56] [Music]
[2:17:58] Oh, he came to me
[2:18:03] when I possessed
[2:18:05] no hope within.
[2:18:10] [Music]
[2:18:12] Oh, he picked me up and drew me gently
[2:18:20] to
[2:18:22] his side.
[2:18:27] Oh, where today in his sweet love I now
[2:18:36] abide
[2:18:41] for he came
[2:18:43] to me.
[2:18:47] Oh,
[2:18:48] he came
[2:18:51] to me.
[2:18:52] [Music]
[2:18:55] For when I couldn't come to where
[2:19:01] he was, oh, he came to me.
[2:19:09] Oh, that's why
[2:19:12] he died.
[2:19:18] Calary
[2:19:21] [Music]
[2:19:24] for when I couldn't come to where
[2:19:30] he was. Oh, he came
[2:19:34] to me.
[2:19:37] Oh,
[2:19:39] he came
[2:19:41] to me.
[2:19:45] Yes.
[2:19:46] He came
[2:19:48] to me
[2:19:54] when I could come
[2:19:58] to where he was.
[2:20:01] He came
[2:20:03] to me.
[2:20:05] [Music]
[2:20:07] Oh, that's why
[2:20:10] he died.
[2:20:14] Oh,
[2:20:17] [Music]
[2:20:22] for when I couldn't come to where
[2:20:28] he was, he came. Oh, would you lift it
[2:20:33] up to him one more time this evening?
[2:20:36] Oh,
[2:20:37] he came
[2:20:39] to me.
[2:20:44] He came
[2:20:47] to me.
[2:20:52] When I couldn't come
[2:20:56] to where he was,
[2:21:00] he came to me.
[2:21:05] Hallelujah.
[2:21:06] [Music]
[2:21:07] I'm the reason he died
[2:21:14] on Calary.
[2:21:22] For when I couldn't come
[2:21:26] to where
[2:21:27] he was,
[2:21:30] he came
[2:21:32] to me.
[2:21:37] [Music]
[2:21:39] Hallelujah.
[2:21:41] Hallelujah.
[2:21:43] Aren't you thankful?
[2:21:46] Aren't you thankful?
[2:21:48] [Music]
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; You were in a place that you could not
[2:21:52] get to him, but thank God he could come
[2:21:56] &gt;&gt; to me. Hallelujah. Praise his wonderful
[2:21:59] name. Thank y'all so much. I appreciate
[2:22:02] that. Amen.
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Would you turn with me? I want to
[2:22:06] I'll try to move very quickly this
[2:22:08] evening to the book of Psalms,
[2:22:12] chapter 107,
[2:22:16] verse one.
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, give thanks
[2:22:26] unto the Lord
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; for he is what?
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; Good.
[2:22:32] And his mercy endureth.
[2:22:35] That word endureth means to continue in
[2:22:38] the same state
[2:22:40] forever.
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; His mercy endureth forever. Verse two.
[2:22:44] Let the redeemed of the Lord say so.
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of
[2:22:50] the enemy. How many redeemed we have
[2:22:53] here this evening. We have a voice
[2:22:55] tonight. We can say I have been
[2:22:58] redeemed.
[2:22:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats.
[2:23:03] Pray that the Lord will will help me to
[2:23:05] get out of the way this evening and uh
[2:23:07] and we can just enter right into his his
[2:23:10] word. I tell you the the word from
[2:23:12] brother Joe there was just just so
[2:23:14] wonderful. So wonderful and and so rich.
[2:23:18] All all of his word all of God's word is
[2:23:20] rich.
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; So rich. In the book of Joel, chapter 2,
[2:23:25] um y'all know me by now I don't bring
[2:23:26] you anything new, but I I'd like to just
[2:23:28] stir up your minds. Uh this evening,
[2:23:31] Joel chapter 2, it says, "And I will
[2:23:32] restore to you the years that the locust
[2:23:35] have eaten, the cankerworm and the
[2:23:37] caterpillar and the palmer worm. My
[2:23:39] great army, his army."
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; That wasn't Satan's army.
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; That was his army. My great army which I
[2:23:47] sent among you. And ye shall eat in
[2:23:49] plenty and be satisfied. And praise the
[2:23:53] name of the Lord your God, that he hath
[2:23:55] dealt wondrously with you and my people
[2:23:59] shall never be ashamed. In the book of
[2:24:02] Exodus 2 verse 23-2,
[2:24:06] it says, "And it came to pass in the
[2:24:08] process of time that the king of Egypt
[2:24:11] died and the children of Israel sighed
[2:24:14] by reason of the bondage and they cried
[2:24:17] and their cry came up unto God by reason
[2:24:20] of the bondage and God heard their
[2:24:22] groaning
[2:24:23] &gt;&gt; and God remembered his covenant
[2:24:26] &gt;&gt; with Abraham."
[2:24:28] You know, there's things that God will
[2:24:30] remember and there's some some things he
[2:24:31] chooses not to remember
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; in in the word a different place. I
[2:24:35] don't have it written down, but it just
[2:24:37] comes to my remembrance. There's there's
[2:24:38] a place where he says about our sins. He
[2:24:41] says, "I will remember them no more."
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; Now, I've heard many people say that God
[2:24:47] God forgets. He forgets it. He doesn't
[2:24:51] forget it.
[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; He just chooses not to remember it. He
[2:24:56] chooses not to bring it to your account
[2:24:58] anymore. There's a whole difference
[2:25:00] between somebody being forgetful or
[2:25:03] somebody making a a cognizant choice
[2:25:08] that says, "I will not because of what
[2:25:10] I've done for you,
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; because of the covenant he has given to
[2:25:14] us,
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; I will not bring it to my remembrance
[2:25:18] against you anymore. Will not charge you
[2:25:20] with that."
[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; That wasn't that wasn't in there. my
[2:25:23] covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and
[2:25:25] with Jacob, and God looked upon the
[2:25:28] children of Israel, and God had respect
[2:25:30] unto them.
[2:25:32] &gt;&gt; You know, it's good to know that in a
[2:25:34] time of trouble, in a time of despair,
[2:25:37] in a lowly state you might find yourself
[2:25:38] in, and you cry out to him, guess what?
[2:25:42] He hears.
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; He hears and he answers.
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; And he remembers his covenant.
[2:25:50] Hallelujah.
[2:25:51] &gt;&gt; The thing I like about God's covenant
[2:25:53] with me, it's not a bilateral agreement.
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; Anybody know about bilateral agreements
[2:26:01] or unilateral agreements?
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; It's unilateral, meaning it only takes
[2:26:05] him
[2:26:06] &gt;&gt; to place it into effect.
[2:26:08] &gt;&gt; Only him. You ain't got to do nothing
[2:26:11] about it.
[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; If he makes a covenant, you know, there
[2:26:14] was many covenants he made and Israel,
[2:26:16] they they went against it. He would he
[2:26:18] would say, "If you'll do this, I'll do
[2:26:19] this. if you'll do this, I'll do that.
[2:26:22] And every time they failed,
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; and so he comes down to a point, he
[2:26:25] says, I'm just going to make a covenant
[2:26:27] with you that I'm going to uphold.
[2:26:30] &gt;&gt; I'm taking you out of the equation. It
[2:26:31] was a unilateral agreement. And he
[2:26:34] remembers his covenant.
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; He will not forget his covenant to you.
[2:26:38] He cares about you. He loves you.
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. I' I'd like to talk to you just a
[2:26:43] few minutes, if I can keep it to a few
[2:26:45] minutes, about the the the kindness of a
[2:26:48] king.
[2:26:50] the kindness of a king. And I tell you,
[2:26:52] we serve the greatest king. You the what
[2:26:55] the the theme of the of of the uh the
[2:26:57] meetings this week is living in his
[2:26:59] goodness, I believe, is is is the theme.
[2:27:02] And um I I I wasn't excuse me. I I
[2:27:06] wasn't thinking I was going to be
[2:27:08] speaking
[2:27:10] this this night, but that that's that's
[2:27:12] fine. And and I just want the Lord to to
[2:27:14] move this e this evening. This morning I
[2:27:17] was I I was listening to a a a song and
[2:27:20] as I was doing some some studying and
[2:27:22] and and a song came on um that I was or
[2:27:25] it was actually some words that I had
[2:27:27] written down in in one of my notes and
[2:27:30] and to a song and I just started I
[2:27:32] started singing this the song out as I
[2:27:34] was reading through my notes and we'll
[2:27:36] get we'll get to that a little bit
[2:27:37] later. But as I started singing the
[2:27:38] song, I just broke out broke down into
[2:27:40] tears because the Lord, the Holy Spirit
[2:27:43] just moved in the room with me and said,
[2:27:46] "This is it. This is what you're
[2:27:48] supposed to talk about." So, you know,
[2:27:51] we we look back at at the uh the the
[2:27:53] promises that was given to Abraham,
[2:27:55] Isaac, and Jacob, and we, you know,
[2:27:56] we'll we'll say among ourselves, that's
[2:27:58] that's that's really pretty words.
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; That that was really pretty. It's great
[2:28:01] that he did that for Abraham, Isaac, and
[2:28:04] Jacob.
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; But what about me? What about me? In the
[2:28:08] book of Galatians, if you'll look at
[2:28:10] Galatians chapter 3 7-9, it says, "Know
[2:28:13] ye therefore that they which are of
[2:28:16] faith,
[2:28:17] &gt;&gt; the same are
[2:28:19] &gt;&gt; the children of Abraham,
[2:28:21] &gt;&gt; and the scripture foreseeing that God
[2:28:22] would justify the heathen through faith,
[2:28:25] preached before the gospel unto Abraham,
[2:28:27] saying, In thee shall all nations be
[2:28:31] blessed. So then they which be of faith
[2:28:34] are blessed with faithful Abraham. So it
[2:28:39] wasn't just a promise and just nice
[2:28:40] words to him. It was to you if you are
[2:28:44] in faith. If you if you move on down to
[2:28:47] verse 29, it says, "And if ye be Christ,
[2:28:53] &gt;&gt; if ye be Christ, then ye are Abraham's
[2:28:58] seed and
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; hes
[2:29:01] &gt;&gt; according to the promise."
[2:29:04] &gt;&gt; It there there's so much heirs of what?
[2:29:06] Heirs to everything. Everything that he
[2:29:08] gave in his covenant, you are a an heir
[2:29:11] to that. So, there's been a covenant of
[2:29:13] love that's been promised to you and
[2:29:15] it's been promised to me. And he wants
[2:29:17] to, this is the thing,
[2:29:20] he he's the the best husband that you
[2:29:22] could ever have
[2:29:24] &gt;&gt; because he wants to bestow his love and
[2:29:28] his favor and his kindness on you. You
[2:29:31] know, sometimes there there's things
[2:29:32] that that we as as husbands want to do
[2:29:34] for our family, for our our wives, and
[2:29:37] maybe sometimes the finances just aren't
[2:29:39] there to do it. You have it in your
[2:29:40] heart. You want to do it for them. You
[2:29:42] want to to just uh lavish your your love
[2:29:45] on them and your blessings and all these
[2:29:47] different things. But sometimes finances
[2:29:49] get in the way. You don't have it to do.
[2:29:51] But see, he don't have that problem.
[2:29:53] &gt;&gt; He don't have that problem. And he wants
[2:29:55] to just he wants to lavish himself on
[2:29:58] you this evening. He wants to pour
[2:30:00] himself out to you. And if we would just
[2:30:02] come to a place that that we would cry
[2:30:04] out unto him,
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; we cry out unto him. Guess what? He
[2:30:08] responds. that he he's not going to turn
[2:30:12] a dead ear to you. He will not. If you
[2:30:14] cry out unto him, have you ever had one
[2:30:16] of your children cry out your name?
[2:30:19] &gt;&gt; They they cry out mommy or daddy, you
[2:30:22] there could be a lot of mommies and
[2:30:23] daddies in the room. But I guess I
[2:30:26] guarantee you if your child cries out
[2:30:29] mommy or daddy, you hear
[2:30:32] &gt;&gt; their voice
[2:30:33] &gt;&gt; and you don't look for somebody else to
[2:30:36] go take care of them.
[2:30:38] Some do.
[2:30:38] &gt;&gt; Well, maybe some do.
[2:30:40] &gt;&gt; You shouldn't look for somebody else to
[2:30:42] go take care of them.
[2:30:44] &gt;&gt; There should be that that in your heart
[2:30:46] that you hear that cry and you jump from
[2:30:49] whatever you're doing. Everything gets
[2:30:51] put down and you go to take care of
[2:30:54] them.
[2:30:55] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT HE DOES FOR YOU.
[2:30:57] &gt;&gt; AS SOON AS YOU CRY OUT to him, he's
[2:31:00] right there.
[2:31:01] &gt;&gt; He's right there. What was it when when
[2:31:03] Peter cried out to him? Peter was was it
[2:31:05] was walking on the water and and he was
[2:31:07] he was sinking because he got his eyes
[2:31:10] off of Christ. Got his eyes onto his
[2:31:12] problems that was all around him and he
[2:31:14] took his eyes off of him and then he
[2:31:16] cried out to him. The Bible says he
[2:31:18] immediately well he couldn't immediately
[2:31:21] reach down his hand to him if he wasn't
[2:31:24] already there right with him.
[2:31:26] &gt;&gt; Now I don't know the proximity of Jesus
[2:31:29] before Peter called out. But I guarantee
[2:31:32] you as soon as he called out, he was
[2:31:34] right there. He's Jehovah Shyama. He is
[2:31:38] present in your trouble.
[2:31:41] &gt;&gt; Not just in a time of trouble,
[2:31:43] &gt;&gt; but he is present in
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; trouble. Now, this is this is a little
[2:31:48] an offside note here. If if Satan is
[2:31:50] trying to to get you into trouble, you
[2:31:54] can look at it this way. All he is doing
[2:31:55] is escorting you into the presence of
[2:31:58] God.
[2:32:00] Because if he is present in your trouble
[2:32:03] and Satan tries to place you into
[2:32:05] trouble, he just escorted you into the
[2:32:09] presence of God. In the message,
[2:32:11] believest thou this.
[2:32:13] &gt;&gt; You hadn't thought about that, had you?
[2:32:18] &gt;&gt; He did. He took me right into his
[2:32:20] presence.
[2:32:22] &gt;&gt; In the message, believest thou this,
[2:32:23] 1950, Brother Bram says, "Now God made a
[2:32:26] covenant with the church
[2:32:27] &gt;&gt; and he wrote it out.
[2:32:32] He he wrote out his covenant
[2:32:34] &gt;&gt; with the many people don't read.
[2:32:38] &gt;&gt; They don't read the covenant enough.
[2:32:41] &gt;&gt; I don't I don't know if how many of you
[2:32:42] ever been called to they used to in in
[2:32:45] the in in the olden days they would have
[2:32:47] the reading of a will.
[2:32:49] &gt;&gt; You know, and if your name was in was
[2:32:51] placed in the will, they would reach out
[2:32:53] to you. They say we're going to have a
[2:32:54] reading of the will on such and such
[2:32:56] date.
[2:32:58] Here's his will.
[2:33:03] &gt;&gt; Here's his Exactly. It's unsealed.
[2:33:08] &gt;&gt; If you want to know what is yours, just
[2:33:11] open it up
[2:33:13] &gt;&gt; and read it. It's right there for you.
[2:33:15] He wrote it out the Bible. And on the
[2:33:17] day of the atonement, God killed his
[2:33:19] son. You believe it? Tore him apart. and
[2:33:22] he took his body up to the right hand of
[2:33:25] his majesty and sent his spirit back as
[2:33:28] a covenant to us. And at that day,
[2:33:31] unless we have the same Holy Spirit in
[2:33:34] us,
[2:33:37] &gt;&gt; we can't go in the body.
[2:33:41] &gt;&gt; It's imperative that you have that Holy
[2:33:44] Spirit dwelling within you. That is your
[2:33:47] token.
[2:33:49] &gt;&gt; That That's what's going to get you in.
[2:33:52] You've got to have the Holy Spirit, man.
[2:33:54] You know, well, how how do you know how
[2:33:56] how do you know if you have the Holy
[2:33:58] Spirit?
[2:34:00] It's going to be doing the same thing as
[2:34:01] it's always done before.
[2:34:04] &gt;&gt; It's going to be a same display of what
[2:34:07] it has done in the past. It's going to
[2:34:09] do the same today. If you have that Holy
[2:34:12] Spirit dwelling within you, Galatians
[2:34:14] 5:22:23 says, "But the fruit of the
[2:34:17] spirit
[2:34:18] &gt;&gt; is love,
[2:34:21] &gt;&gt; joy,
[2:34:24] &gt;&gt; peace,
[2:34:26] &gt;&gt; we could all use a little bit more
[2:34:28] peace.
[2:34:29] &gt;&gt; I can use more peace.
[2:34:32] &gt;&gt; All of them. The next one is tough.
[2:34:35] Longsuffering.
[2:34:38] I don't want to put up with people that
[2:34:40] long sometimes.
[2:34:41] &gt;&gt; But the Holy Spirit within me
[2:34:45] &gt;&gt; makes provision for that
[2:34:48] &gt;&gt; if we will yield
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; to the Holy Spirit
[2:34:51] &gt;&gt; in us. Gentleness, goodness, goodness or
[2:34:55] kindness can be replaced there. Um
[2:34:58] faith, meekness, temperance. Against
[2:35:00] such there is no law. So if you have the
[2:35:03] Holy Spirit in you, it's going to be
[2:35:05] producing the right fruit.
[2:35:07] &gt;&gt; You agree with me on that?
[2:35:10] &gt;&gt; So
[2:35:11] have you ever have you ever had a
[2:35:12] thought or a wonder in your mind? You
[2:35:14] know, all these things that God has done
[2:35:17] for me, he's given me all these things.
[2:35:19] What does he require of me?
[2:35:22] &gt;&gt; You know that there's there's a
[2:35:23] scripture that tells you what he
[2:35:25] requires of you
[2:35:27] &gt;&gt; in the book of Micah. Yes, sir.
[2:35:29] &gt;&gt; Little book of Micah 6:8.
[2:35:32] It reads, "He hath showed thee, oh man,
[2:35:36] what is good,
[2:35:38] &gt;&gt; and what do the Lord require of thee,
[2:35:42] &gt;&gt; but to do justly,
[2:35:45] &gt;&gt; and to love mercy,
[2:35:47] &gt;&gt; and to walk humbly with God."
[2:35:52] &gt;&gt; And that don't sound difficult at all,
[2:35:54] does it?
[2:35:59] to love mercy. Oh, I love it when
[2:36:02] somebody has mercy for me.
[2:36:06] &gt;&gt; I love it when somebody has grace for
[2:36:09] me.
[2:36:10] &gt;&gt; I love it when somebody has
[2:36:13] longsuffering
[2:36:14] with me.
[2:36:16] &gt;&gt; But what does it mean for you to love
[2:36:18] mercy towards somebody else?
[2:36:23] And there's a um I I I I I like to look
[2:36:26] up words and um so I I looked up I said
[2:36:30] it's got to be something more to it than
[2:36:33] than just what you see on the surface
[2:36:35] and the the topical approach there, you
[2:36:38] know, that that it's got to be deeper
[2:36:40] than just love mercy. So I I had to look
[2:36:42] up that phrase,
[2:36:44] &gt;&gt; love mercy. And the word mercy that was
[2:36:47] that was in the original in the Hebrew
[2:36:50] that was used there is spelled c hes
[2:36:54] d and I don't pronounce Hebrew very well
[2:36:59] so I will try it has
[2:37:04] so it's a small word but it has a really
[2:37:07] big meaning
[2:37:10] has in the is is not it's not even used
[2:37:13] that that word said is not even used in
[2:37:16] the New Testament. I I found that odd. I
[2:37:18] thought that it would be, but it was
[2:37:19] used throughout the Old Testament. The
[2:37:21] closest thing that you could find in the
[2:37:22] New Testament that was that would mimic
[2:37:26] it or or be a synonym of it would be
[2:37:28] charity or grace
[2:37:30] &gt;&gt; or I'm sorry, not charity. Um, C H A R I
[2:37:34] S C Chis.
[2:37:38] Yeah. So, it's Greek, but it was C H A R
[2:37:41] I S. Uh, which interpreted is grace. And
[2:37:45] you know it throughout time the Bible
[2:37:47] scholars they they've complained um as I
[2:37:50] was doing some reading about the the
[2:37:51] word hed they they complained that that
[2:37:54] it's it's so difficult to translate that
[2:37:56] word into English because it really has
[2:37:58] no precise equivalent word in our
[2:38:01] language. Um so they the closest that
[2:38:04] they could get in in scripture the
[2:38:06] closest that they could get when they
[2:38:07] were trying to translate it is they they
[2:38:10] made up the word loving kindness.
[2:38:13] Brother brother brother Brandon would
[2:38:14] talk would talk about thy loving
[2:38:15] kindness and it was it was a strange
[2:38:18] concept to him about loving thy loving
[2:38:20] kindness is better than life. He he
[2:38:22] would say that that didn't make didn't
[2:38:24] make a whole lot of sense to him. How
[2:38:25] could how could anything be better and
[2:38:27] greater than life? But his and brother
[2:38:30] Brown would use he would he would
[2:38:31] shorten he said I love kindness. But the
[2:38:34] loving kindness is what what it's
[2:38:36] talking about. But loving kindness it it
[2:38:38] it's represented by other words like
[2:38:40] mercy, steadfast love, sometimes
[2:38:43] loyalty. But as I was reading through it
[2:38:46] and and looking at it, if if you look at
[2:38:48] the words, all of this list of words
[2:38:51] that they use to try to describe this
[2:38:53] single word said, then it it it closely
[2:38:57] relates to the nine fruits of the
[2:38:59] spirit.
[2:39:00] &gt;&gt; You you almost look at every single one
[2:39:02] of them. You're like, "Okay, that was
[2:39:03] that that's what I'm supposed to be
[2:39:05] presenting." If the Holy Spirit is in
[2:39:07] me, then the fruit of the Holy Spirit is
[2:39:10] has said
[2:39:11] &gt;&gt; it's it's not just it's it's not just a
[2:39:14] very small thing. It's it's it's rather
[2:39:17] enormous. And and I don't believe it's
[2:39:18] coincidental. I I believe it's I believe
[2:39:20] it's designed by God that way that it
[2:39:23] wasn't just something whenever he says
[2:39:24] that's what he requires of us,
[2:39:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:39:27] &gt;&gt; His love,
[2:39:29] &gt;&gt; his love,
[2:39:31] &gt;&gt; not your love. He requires of you his
[2:39:35] love towards somebody because I love
[2:39:37] people in a different way than Christ
[2:39:38] loved people.
[2:39:41] &gt;&gt; You know that there's times that that
[2:39:43] that something is said to me that that I
[2:39:45] kind of I buck up against and and I
[2:39:47] can't it's hard for me to to let it go.
[2:39:50] &gt;&gt; But see, he chooses not to remember
[2:39:52] those things. But oh my goodness, it's
[2:39:54] hard for us in our humanity to let some
[2:39:57] of those things go and and just walk
[2:39:59] away from it and say, you know what, I
[2:40:01] just choose not to think about that no
[2:40:02] more. I'm going to I'm going to set it
[2:40:04] down and I'm not going to hold it
[2:40:07] against them. See, a lot of people says,
[2:40:09] well, you know, I'll forgive you, but
[2:40:10] I'm not going to forget it.
[2:40:12] &gt;&gt; And the next time that they're around
[2:40:14] you, in their mind, they're still
[2:40:15] thinking about something that happened
[2:40:18] 20 years ago. It it could have been just
[2:40:21] a few words that was illspoken and they
[2:40:23] let it linger and it just lets it dig
[2:40:26] and dig and gets deeper and deeper
[2:40:29] &gt;&gt; and it takes a hold of a person and they
[2:40:32] there's no way to get rid of it
[2:40:34] &gt;&gt; in their own self. There's no way.
[2:40:36] &gt;&gt; The only thing that can take take that
[2:40:37] away is the Holy Spirit of God that
[2:40:40] comes in with a surgical knife. I I I
[2:40:42] thought it was so wonderful last last
[2:40:44] night as as brother brother Wesley was
[2:40:46] talking about carving it away all the
[2:40:49] excess, cutting it away that we've got
[2:40:52] to get rid of all this excess things in
[2:40:54] our life. If you're ever going to draw
[2:40:56] closer to Christ, you're not going to
[2:40:58] draw closer to him with all of the
[2:41:00] things of the world attached to you.
[2:41:01] You're not going to draw close to him
[2:41:03] with hatred attached to you. You're not
[2:41:05] going to draw close to him with
[2:41:07] bitterness and grudges or any of those
[2:41:10] types of things. The only thing that
[2:41:12] draws close to Christ is Christ.
[2:41:15] &gt;&gt; The only thing that draws close to
[2:41:17] Christ is Christ. And the only thing
[2:41:19] that he will draw close to, guess what?
[2:41:22] Is himself.
[2:41:23] &gt;&gt; So if you don't have himself living in
[2:41:26] you, he's not going to draw close to
[2:41:28] you.
[2:41:29] &gt;&gt; That's the only way. And we've got to
[2:41:31] have that union. We've got Y'all had
[2:41:32] communion the other night. You've got to
[2:41:34] have If you ever looked at at the word
[2:41:36] communion, it's a very intimate word.
[2:41:38] It's it's it's you know we we use the
[2:41:40] the word when we're talking about the
[2:41:42] the bread and the wine, but it you you
[2:41:44] look up the word communion and and the
[2:41:46] way it was presented in scripture. It's
[2:41:48] a very it's an intimacy between between
[2:41:52] &gt;&gt; a husband and a wife.
[2:41:54] &gt;&gt; It's very intimate. I I'll just I'll
[2:41:56] leave it leave it at that. And and and
[2:41:58] but that's what he wants to have with
[2:42:00] us. But he will not he will not be
[2:42:04] intimate
[2:42:05] &gt;&gt; unless it's the same spirit.
[2:42:09] &gt;&gt; That's that's all it's going to be. It
[2:42:11] it has to be that way. Sorry that wasn't
[2:42:13] in the notes either. Um but he he he
[2:42:16] gave it to me. You know, there there's a
[2:42:18] song there's a song that was written um
[2:42:22] back in the
[2:42:24] late 1800s um by a man named George Mat.
[2:42:29] And uh you you may have I know you have
[2:42:31] heard heard the song. You may have sung
[2:42:32] it years and years ago. Oh love that
[2:42:35] will not let me go. George Mat
[2:42:39] wrote that song. He was born in 1842. He
[2:42:42] died in 1906.
[2:42:45] But at the age of 20
[2:42:47] he he was he was engaged to uh to be
[2:42:50] married. And at the age of 20, right
[2:42:53] before they was going to be married, he
[2:42:55] found out that he was going blind.
[2:42:59] and his fiance
[2:43:02] decided she wanted nothing to do with
[2:43:04] him
[2:43:06] because she did not want to live and
[2:43:09] take care of someone who was blind.
[2:43:13] So she walked away from him. They they
[2:43:15] were they were at the at the point of
[2:43:16] getting married. So he ended up living
[2:43:19] with his sister for 20 20 more years. He
[2:43:22] lived with his sister and and at over
[2:43:24] that time his eyesight got worse and
[2:43:25] worse to a point that he became
[2:43:27] completely blind. His sister took care
[2:43:29] of him and then after 20 years his
[2:43:32] sister ended up getting married. Yeah. I
[2:43:35] think it was Yeah. Yeah. She was getting
[2:43:37] married and on the eve of his sister's
[2:43:39] wedding is whenever he pinned these
[2:43:42] words. Oh love that will not let me go.
[2:43:48] I rest
[2:43:50] my weary soul in thee. I give thee back
[2:43:54] the life I owe. That in thine ocean
[2:43:58] depths it flows. May richer, fuller be.
[2:44:05] See, he he he came to a place he was
[2:44:07] heartbroken.
[2:44:10] His fiance had already dropped him. She
[2:44:13] already let him go. And now his sister
[2:44:16] who had took care of him, she was
[2:44:19] getting married and he wasn't going to
[2:44:20] be able to stay with them. And he was he
[2:44:24] was at a point of despair. He he was he
[2:44:26] said, "I I've already been let go here
[2:44:29] and I'm being let go here. I've been let
[2:44:31] down over here and now my sister's
[2:44:34] letting me go, too. She's she's dropping
[2:44:35] the ball on me. Where am I going to go?"
[2:44:37] And the only place he could turn to
[2:44:40] &gt;&gt; was God. And these words came to him and
[2:44:43] he wrote the song, oh love that will
[2:44:45] will not let me go. He took Soulless in
[2:44:48] a love
[2:44:49] &gt;&gt; that would not
[2:44:51] &gt;&gt; could not
[2:44:54] &gt;&gt; and will not let you go.
[2:44:56] &gt;&gt; His His love is everlasting.
[2:44:59] &gt;&gt; He will not with everybody else. When
[2:45:02] the world forgets about you,
[2:45:04] &gt;&gt; sometimes even your family seemingly
[2:45:07] forgets about you.
[2:45:10] you you become in in their eyes, you
[2:45:12] become a burden, you know, to to some
[2:45:16] people, they they become they they feel
[2:45:17] like they're a burden. They become
[2:45:18] ostracized from their family and the
[2:45:20] family doesn't want anything to do with
[2:45:21] them and they they they have nobody.
[2:45:23] They feel like they have I don't where
[2:45:24] do I turn to? I have nobody.
[2:45:27] &gt;&gt; But there is a love that you can turn
[2:45:28] to.
[2:45:31] &gt;&gt; That love his love will not
[2:45:34] &gt;&gt; it cannot
[2:45:36] &gt;&gt; cannot let you go.
[2:45:43] There's a whole lot of examples in in
[2:45:45] the scripture um about I said God's
[2:45:50] covenant love. You can find it in
[2:45:52] Genesis. You find it in Esther. You find
[2:45:54] it in Ruth. Find it in a bunch of
[2:45:55] places. I'm not going to spend spend a
[2:45:57] whole lot of time with with all the
[2:45:59] different ones, but I I do want to I
[2:46:01] just I want to draw your attention to to
[2:46:04] one story this evening. And uh this this
[2:46:07] is something that just really it really
[2:46:10] as I as I was thinking of the song this
[2:46:11] morning, it really just spoke to me. And
[2:46:14] um you know just in the book of Samuel
[2:46:17] um you set the stage with it. Samuel um
[2:46:20] chapter 4 in verse 4 says, "And Jonathan
[2:46:25] Saul's son had a son that was lame of
[2:46:30] his feet. He was five years old.
[2:46:34] When the tidings came of Saul, I think I
[2:46:37] don't Yeah. tidings came of Saul and
[2:46:40] Jonathan out of Jezrael and his nurse
[2:46:43] took him up and fled. And it came to
[2:46:45] pass as she made haste to flee that he
[2:46:49] fell
[2:46:50] &gt;&gt; and became lame and his name was
[2:46:54] Mphibicheth.
[2:46:56] &gt;&gt; You know, I I often wondered whenever I
[2:46:58] I've read the story of Mphibicheth and
[2:47:00] and and wondered you what what happened.
[2:47:03] I mean, you it tells us, you know, he he
[2:47:06] was dropped and and and and but in my in
[2:47:10] my mind, I mean, I've I've not proud of
[2:47:12] it, but I've I've dropped my child
[2:47:14] before, you know, I wasn't trying to,
[2:47:17] but you know that sometimes they're
[2:47:19] moving around, you're you're playing
[2:47:20] with them or something, you dropped them
[2:47:21] and and it didn't break their feet, you
[2:47:24] know, it it didn't it didn't break them
[2:47:26] to a point that they were lame. So, you
[2:47:28] know, I I don't I don't know. I I mean,
[2:47:29] I could imagine different things going.
[2:47:31] I mean, they were trying to flee from
[2:47:33] from an from an army. So, I don't I
[2:47:35] don't know if if if in that time that
[2:47:37] that had happened, if if you know, if he
[2:47:39] he got dropped and maybe stepped on, you
[2:47:41] know, maybe a horse or something, they
[2:47:43] they're coming through or the people got
[2:47:44] trampled on. I don't I don't know. But I
[2:47:46] feel like it was something a little bit
[2:47:47] more severe than just just a drop, you
[2:47:50] know, but I I for him to be lame in his
[2:47:53] feet. But you if you you know you you
[2:47:56] you start looking at that and and you
[2:47:57] realize that that really in in at some
[2:48:00] point in each one of our lives
[2:48:03] &gt;&gt; every single one of us have come to a
[2:48:05] place that we feel like we've been
[2:48:08] dropped
[2:48:09] &gt;&gt; that we've been let down. you you had
[2:48:12] your you had your trust and your faith
[2:48:14] and your your hope in in maybe a person,
[2:48:17] you know, it could have been it could
[2:48:18] have been a family member that that you
[2:48:20] really looked up to and you really held
[2:48:25] on to every word that they said
[2:48:28] &gt;&gt; and suddenly
[2:48:30] it's just gone and you just feel like
[2:48:33] now what do I do now?
[2:48:35] &gt;&gt; What do I do now? what they were telling
[2:48:37] me, you know, they I found out that it
[2:48:40] was just superficial. It was just it was
[2:48:42] just words, you know. They were just
[2:48:44] like like people like to use the word
[2:48:46] salad, you know. They were just spewing
[2:48:47] off things and whenever it really comes
[2:48:49] down to where the rubber meets the road,
[2:48:50] you find out it wasn't even real, you
[2:48:53] know, and and so sometimes things happen
[2:48:55] that like that and and we we you know,
[2:48:57] we you might have had somebody in that
[2:49:00] um that you that you placed faith in
[2:49:02] that you're like, I I'm trusting you to
[2:49:05] give me words of life. And then all of a
[2:49:08] sudden, you know, either they're gone or
[2:49:10] they go off the word and you realize
[2:49:13] you've been dropped. You've been let
[2:49:14] down.
[2:49:15] &gt;&gt; You know, you've been led down a wrong
[2:49:17] path.
[2:49:18] &gt;&gt; And and you feel you you feel betrayed.
[2:49:23] &gt;&gt; You feel betrayed. And it wasn't even of
[2:49:25] your own doing.
[2:49:27] &gt;&gt; It just circumstances made it that way.
[2:49:30] And now you're lame. You know, you're
[2:49:34] you're struggling to find a foothold.
[2:49:36] you're you're struggling for for for
[2:49:38] many years maybe after that you're each
[2:49:40] every day is a struggle. It's a fight.
[2:49:42] It's a battle for you just to just to
[2:49:44] get up and go that day that next day
[2:49:47] you're you're struggling in your mind
[2:49:48] because all the different things that's
[2:49:50] happened and you're like who's the next
[2:49:52] person that's going to let me down? How
[2:49:54] how can I now put my faith in somebody
[2:49:56] else? How can I trust somebody else to
[2:49:59] lead me, to guide me, to point me in the
[2:50:01] right direction because some somebody
[2:50:03] said something over here and I come to
[2:50:05] find out that it was wrong, it was
[2:50:06] misleading, and I feel betrayed and I
[2:50:08] feel dropped. It takes a lot to trust
[2:50:10] somebody.
[2:50:12] &gt;&gt; It it it takes a lot. Have you ever you
[2:50:13] ever seen people do what they call trust
[2:50:15] falls?
[2:50:17] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to do a trust fall.
[2:50:19] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to do that as an example
[2:50:20] this evening either because I'd be
[2:50:22] afraid that somebody would say, "Don't
[2:50:24] trust in in man, trust in God." And they
[2:50:26] just move out of the way and let you
[2:50:27] fall. I've seen do that. Exactly. They
[2:50:31] they they they coach you into it and
[2:50:33] say, "Yeah, do a trust fall." And then
[2:50:35] as soon as you start falling, they move
[2:50:36] out of the way and say, "Yeah,
[2:50:41] &gt;&gt; I trust in him. I'm going to I'm going
[2:50:44] to trust in him." In in 2 Samuel chapter
[2:50:48] 9, if it if you would allow me, I I want
[2:50:50] to read through um I want to read
[2:50:53] through this chapter. I can read fast if
[2:50:55] you can listen fast. Um,
[2:50:59] let's try it. Okay. And David said, "Is
[2:51:02] there yet any that is left of the house
[2:51:04] of Saul that I may show him has said for
[2:51:08] Jonathan's sake?" See, he remembered the
[2:51:12] covenant that he had made with Jonathan.
[2:51:16] &gt;&gt; And there was of the house of Saul a
[2:51:18] servant whose name was Zeba. And when
[2:51:20] they had called him unto David, the king
[2:51:22] said unto him, "Art thou Zeba?" And he
[2:51:24] said, "Thy servant is he?" And the king
[2:51:28] said, "Is there not yet any of the house
[2:51:30] of Saul that I may show the kindness of
[2:51:33] God unto him?" And Zeba said unto the
[2:51:36] king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is
[2:51:39] lame on his feet. And the king said unto
[2:51:41] him, Where is he? And Zeba said unto the
[2:51:43] king, "Behold, he is in the house of
[2:51:45] Mahir, if I say that correct, the son of
[2:51:48] Amiel in Loabar, the king David," then
[2:51:52] King David sent and fetched him out of
[2:51:54] the house of Makir, the son of Amile
[2:51:57] from Loabar. Now when Mphibicheth, the
[2:51:59] son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was
[2:52:03] come unto David, he fell on his face and
[2:52:05] did reverence, and David said,
[2:52:07] Mphibicheth, and he answered, Behold thy
[2:52:10] servant. I I I like the humility that he
[2:52:13] was presenting. You know, I I'm I'm
[2:52:15] thinking that Mphibicheth was wondering
[2:52:18] why was he being called in front of the
[2:52:20] king when his grandfather had been the
[2:52:23] previous king. And if you know the
[2:52:25] traditions of the time, they would kill
[2:52:29] all the members of the previous family.
[2:52:32] So in his mind, you know, he's like, I'm
[2:52:35] not exactly sure why I'm being called in
[2:52:37] front of this king, but I'm going to be
[2:52:40] I'm going to show humility. I'm not
[2:52:42] going to stand up and be prideful and
[2:52:43] say, this is where I'm supposed to be.
[2:52:46] No, he went with humility before And
[2:52:48] David said unto him, "Fear not, for I
[2:52:51] will surely show thee kindness for
[2:52:53] Jonathan thy father's sake, and will
[2:52:55] restore thee all the land of Saul thy
[2:52:58] father, and thou shalt eat bread at my
[2:53:00] table continually."
[2:53:02] And he bowed himself, and said, "What is
[2:53:05] thy servant that thou shouldest look
[2:53:07] upon such a dead dog as I am?"
[2:53:12] Sounds kind of like Peter, you know, in
[2:53:14] Luke where he said, "Depart from me. I'm
[2:53:16] a I'm a sinful man, oh Lord. He He
[2:53:20] approached him with the right attitude.
[2:53:22] He He approached him with humility.
[2:53:26] Verse 9 says, "Then the king called to
[2:53:28] Zeba, Saul's servant, and said unto him,
[2:53:30] I have given unto thy master's son, all
[2:53:33] that pertain to Saul, and to all his
[2:53:36] house. Thou therefore, and thy sons, and
[2:53:39] thy servants shall till the land for
[2:53:41] him. Thou shalt bring in the fruits, and
[2:53:43] thy master's son may have food to eat.
[2:53:46] But Mphibicheth, thy master's son, shall
[2:53:49] eat bread always at my table. Now Zeba
[2:53:52] had 15 sons and 20 servants. Then then
[2:53:55] said Zeba unto the king, according to
[2:53:57] all that my lord the king hath commanded
[2:53:59] his servant, so shall thy servant do. As
[2:54:03] for Mphibicheth, said the king, he shall
[2:54:06] eat at my table as one of the king's
[2:54:09] sons. And Mphibicheth had a young son
[2:54:12] whose name was Micah. And all that dwelt
[2:54:15] in the house of Zeba were servants unto
[2:54:18] Mphibicheth. So Mphibicheth dwelt in
[2:54:21] Jerusalem, for he did eat continually
[2:54:24] at the king's table
[2:54:27] and was lame on both his feet.
[2:54:30] You know the the the thing about about
[2:54:32] that story if you you you start thinking
[2:54:35] about the condition of Mphibicheth.
[2:54:39] &gt;&gt; Every single time he had to be taken
[2:54:43] somewhere or was wanting to go
[2:54:44] somewhere, somebody had to carry him.
[2:54:48] &gt;&gt; Every single time. No matter if he was 6
[2:54:51] years old, 16 years old, 26 years old,
[2:54:56] or what age he was at, the lameness in
[2:54:59] his feet prevented him from moving about
[2:55:02] freely. And he always had to be carried
[2:55:05] wherever he went,
[2:55:08] &gt;&gt; no matter what. And and sometimes people
[2:55:11] that are around you and they if if if
[2:55:13] they're feeling like they're they're
[2:55:14] having to carry your burden all the
[2:55:16] time, sometimes they don't want to be,
[2:55:19] you know, sometimes they they're like, I
[2:55:20] I don't really want to hang out with
[2:55:21] them so much because every time I'm with
[2:55:25] them, I'm having to pick them up.
[2:55:26] &gt;&gt; Having to pick them up. But see, the
[2:55:28] thing wasn't it wasn't his fault.
[2:55:30] He didn't do anything. It wasn't it
[2:55:33] wasn't his fault that that he had gotten
[2:55:35] dropped. It wasn't his fault that he
[2:55:36] became lame in his feet. And I'm sure
[2:55:38] maybe in his own self it was it was kind
[2:55:40] of an embarrassment to him. You know,
[2:55:43] here here I am. I was supposed to be a
[2:55:46] prince.
[2:55:48] &gt;&gt; I I was in in the line of of Saul. I'm
[2:55:51] supposed to be a prince.
[2:55:53] &gt;&gt; I'm not supposed to be living in Loabar.
[2:55:56] I'm not supposed to be living in a place
[2:55:57] where nobody cares that that that nobody
[2:56:00] cares about your voice of what you have
[2:56:02] to say. You you cry out in Loabar,
[2:56:04] nobody's there to hear you. That's
[2:56:06] &gt;&gt; right.
[2:56:07] nobody there. There was no pastor. It
[2:56:09] was it was it was it was a dead place.
[2:56:12] And so many people are living in dead
[2:56:15] places. And our brother Joe was was
[2:56:17] saying, "We've been called out."
[2:56:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:56:20] &gt;&gt; Well, he he had to be called out. He
[2:56:23] couldn't get himself out.
[2:56:26] &gt;&gt; But there was a call that came from a
[2:56:27] king
[2:56:30] &gt;&gt; to bring him out.
[2:56:32] And there's been a call that's come out
[2:56:34] to you tonight
[2:56:36] &gt;&gt; to bring you out
[2:56:38] &gt;&gt; of the death that you're dwelling in.
[2:56:40] Cuz that's what Loabar was. It was a It
[2:56:42] was a place you would go to die. It was
[2:56:44] it was just death there. There was no
[2:56:46] life there. Nobody cared about your
[2:56:49] problems cuz they had problems of their
[2:56:51] own. It was full of poverty.
[2:56:54] &gt;&gt; So he came from a palace and went to
[2:56:57] poverty.
[2:56:59] He he was going to be a prince and it
[2:57:01] became a popper
[2:57:03] &gt;&gt; and it wasn't anything he did. And
[2:57:05] sometimes the situations that we are in
[2:57:08] didn't really have anything to do with
[2:57:10] you. That's
[2:57:10] &gt;&gt; right.
[2:57:11] &gt;&gt; Something else that somebody else did
[2:57:13] sometimes has caused you to be in that
[2:57:16] place. But there's a king tonight
[2:57:20] &gt;&gt; that wants to extend his kindness. He
[2:57:23] wants to extend his love. He wants to
[2:57:26] extend his mercy to you and tell you,
[2:57:28] you don't have to dwell in Loabar
[2:57:31] anymore.
[2:57:32] &gt;&gt; You don't have to dwell in death
[2:57:34] anymore. You don't have to dwell. I'm
[2:57:37] going to bring you. I'm going to sit you
[2:57:39] at my table. Now, the thing about the
[2:57:42] David to Mphibicheth, David had the
[2:57:44] power, he had the ability, he had the
[2:57:47] finances, he had everything, the
[2:57:49] authority to restore
[2:57:52] &gt;&gt; wealth. Praise God.
[2:57:54] &gt;&gt; He could restore wealth to
[2:57:57] &gt;&gt; Mphibicheth,
[2:57:59] &gt;&gt; but he could not restore health.
[2:58:04] &gt;&gt; He couldn't restore his feet. Even
[2:58:07] though he was now back in the palace,
[2:58:11] &gt;&gt; he was still lame. And and he was
[2:58:13] reminded of it every single time that he
[2:58:17] was called to the king's table. He still
[2:58:19] knew that I'm lame in my feet because
[2:58:22] servants had to come and pick him up
[2:58:25] &gt;&gt; and carry him.
[2:58:28] But see, we can come to a table tonight
[2:58:32] &gt;&gt; that he calls you to
[2:58:35] &gt;&gt; that gives you life,
[2:58:38] &gt;&gt; that can restore the brokenhearted,
[2:58:41] &gt;&gt; that can restore the damaged lives, the
[2:58:44] things the things where you have become
[2:58:46] lame in yourself, he can restore that.
[2:58:50] He's not just going to place you at his
[2:58:53] table and cover up because that's what
[2:58:55] at the table they didn't see the damage
[2:58:58] to his legs. Whenever he sat down at the
[2:59:00] table, he looked like everybody else.
[2:59:05] &gt;&gt; But whenever he had to leave that table,
[2:59:08] everybody knew,
[2:59:09] &gt;&gt; oh, that's Mphibicheth.
[2:59:12] &gt;&gt; He's lame in his feet.
[2:59:14] He got dropped whenever he was young.
[2:59:17] &gt;&gt; And it was constant in his mind. It
[2:59:20] happened to every single day. That would
[2:59:22] go over and over in his mind. But see,
[2:59:24] tonight, you don't have to stay in that
[2:59:27] mindset.
[2:59:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:59:29] &gt;&gt; You don't have to stay in the mindset of
[2:59:32] Mphibicheth. You don't have to stay with
[2:59:35] lame feet. You don't have to stay
[2:59:38] defeated and and dragged down with all
[2:59:42] the worries and distress of the world.
[2:59:44] Let those things be cut off of you
[2:59:47] tonight. Let the master, let the king
[2:59:51] offer his love, offer his mercy to you
[2:59:54] tonight. Offer his healing to you. Cuz
[2:59:57] that's WHAT HE WANTS TO DO.
[2:59:59] &gt;&gt; He wants to make you whole.
[3:00:02] &gt;&gt; You're not going to come to his table
[3:00:04] and still be an invalid tonight.
[3:00:07] &gt;&gt; Mphibicheth did. Every single time he
[3:00:11] went to the to David's table, he was
[3:00:13] still an invalid.
[3:00:15] But tonight, God calls to you.
[3:00:19] &gt;&gt; He draws you. He invites you to come to
[3:00:22] his table. And he says, "If you'll come
[3:00:24] to me,
[3:00:25] &gt;&gt; you can rest.
[3:00:28] &gt;&gt; I can give you complete rest. I can take
[3:00:30] it take away any pain.
[3:00:34] anything that that this world has tried
[3:00:36] to lay on to you that maybe maybe a
[3:00:40] family member has burdened you with, I
[3:00:42] can take all of those things away.
[3:00:45] &gt;&gt; All you have to do is come to my table.
[3:00:49] &gt;&gt; Come come to my table. That's that's the
[3:00:51] kindness of a king.
[3:00:54] &gt;&gt; But see, he has the ability to do that
[3:00:57] tonight.
[3:00:59] and he wants to he wants to
[3:01:03] uh
[3:01:06] I want to invite the the musicians to
[3:01:08] come back. I want to share with you
[3:01:09] maybe just one one one more little uh
[3:01:14] little scripture or thought in and uh
[3:01:18] in the book of Ephesians
[3:01:21] chapter 2
[3:01:23] verse 4-7
[3:01:25] but God
[3:01:28] I tell you those two words but God
[3:01:34] &gt;&gt; I don't care what your problem is
[3:01:35] tonight I don't care what your
[3:01:38] brokenness is tonight.
[3:01:41] &gt;&gt; I don't care your heartaches,
[3:01:44] but God
[3:01:46] &gt;&gt; who is rich in mercy
[3:01:50] for his great love wherewith he loved
[3:01:52] us. Even when we were dead in sins,
[3:01:59] &gt;&gt; he didn't wait till you were all cleaned
[3:02:01] up.
[3:02:03] Even when we were dead in sins, hath
[3:02:06] quickened us together with Christ. By
[3:02:10] grace ye are saved, and hath raised us
[3:02:12] up together.
[3:02:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:02:15] &gt;&gt; And made us sit together in heavenly
[3:02:18] places in Christ Jesus.
[3:02:22] &gt;&gt; When when Christ was was raised up,
[3:02:24] where was he placed?
[3:02:26] At the right hand of the father. What's
[3:02:29] the right hand represent?
[3:02:32] power and authority.
[3:02:34] He has seated us in him
[3:02:39] in that spot.
[3:02:41] &gt;&gt; That's the position that we have been
[3:02:43] called to tonight.
[3:02:46] &gt;&gt; The same position that he holds is where
[3:02:49] he has quickened us and he has drawn us
[3:02:53] together with Christ. He's raised us up
[3:02:56] together, made us sit together in
[3:02:57] heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in
[3:02:59] the ages to come,
[3:03:02] &gt;&gt; he might show the exceeding riches of
[3:03:06] his grace
[3:03:08] and his kindness
[3:03:10] toward us through Christ.
[3:03:13] Who raised you up? He did.
[3:03:18] Mphibicheth could not raise himself up.
[3:03:22] It had to be multiple people to raise
[3:03:24] him up. You tonight could not raise
[3:03:28] yourself up
[3:03:31] &gt;&gt; out of the sins of this world.
[3:03:33] &gt;&gt; Absolutely no way.
[3:03:35] &gt;&gt; You could not do it. There was no
[3:03:38] righteousness in you to be able to
[3:03:40] remove yourself from the sins of this
[3:03:43] world. But by his righteousness,
[3:03:46] &gt;&gt; by his grace, by his loving kindness, he
[3:03:49] chose you. He came to you when you
[3:03:52] couldn't go to him.
[3:03:55] &gt;&gt; There's so many I love love looking at
[3:03:57] things in the scripture that many times
[3:03:59] people went to Christ.
[3:04:02] &gt;&gt; But go through and look at the times he
[3:04:05] chose to go to somebody.
[3:04:07] &gt;&gt; There's a difference. There's a
[3:04:09] difference of what happens when he
[3:04:11] chooses to go to you. It's something
[3:04:14] special. Many people came to him and
[3:04:16] many of them went away. Yes.
[3:04:19] &gt;&gt; But when he chooses
[3:04:21] &gt;&gt; of his own choosing
[3:04:24] &gt;&gt; to come to you.
[3:04:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:04:26] &gt;&gt; And that's what he's doing tonight
[3:04:28] &gt;&gt; of his own choosing.
[3:04:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:04:31] &gt;&gt; He comes down and says, "I'll take you.
[3:04:34] &gt;&gt; I'll take you.
[3:04:36] &gt;&gt; I see myself in you because before the
[3:04:39] foundation of the world, you were in
[3:04:41] him.
[3:04:44] Do you ever do you ever think of fathom
[3:04:46] that before the foundation of the world
[3:04:50] you were already in his mind
[3:04:53] &gt;&gt; before anything was created
[3:04:56] &gt;&gt; the plan of redemption was already in
[3:05:00] place.
[3:05:01] &gt;&gt; The plan to draw me to him.
[3:05:04] &gt;&gt; That there's an important part about
[3:05:06] that. There has to be a representation
[3:05:09] of him inside of you.
[3:05:12] For there ever to be a calling and a
[3:05:15] drawing from him to you,
[3:05:19] &gt;&gt; has to be a rep representation.
[3:05:24] He picked me up when I couldn't even
[3:05:25] look up.
[3:05:30] You know, there's there's times in in
[3:05:32] your life that you you go through trials
[3:05:34] and you go through struggles and
[3:05:37] things that that just seem so
[3:05:40] overbearing on you and you're just like,
[3:05:44] I I can't do it no more.
[3:05:46] You don't you don't know, you know, how
[3:05:48] you're going to take your next breath.
[3:05:51] Sometimes you you you feel so oppressed
[3:05:53] and you you feel like the just the
[3:05:55] weight of the world and and and I I
[3:05:58] don't you know you become so stressed
[3:06:00] and and Satan will will plant all these
[3:06:02] thoughts in your mind of of of of you
[3:06:04] know there's no reason for even you to
[3:06:07] to keep on going because you just don't
[3:06:09] you can't do anything.
[3:06:12] You know, brother brother Greley was
[3:06:14] saying last night he was talking about
[3:06:16] being nervous and he said just embrace
[3:06:18] that. He said, "I just I realized I just
[3:06:20] had to embrace it. Just embrace that."
[3:06:22] Well, I'm going to I'm going to offer
[3:06:24] this to you tonight. The next time that
[3:06:27] you you come to that place that you
[3:06:29] said, "I don't know what I can do. I
[3:06:32] don't know how I'm going to get out of
[3:06:34] this situation," go ahead and embrace
[3:06:36] that and recognize you aren't going to
[3:06:40] get yourself out of it.
[3:06:43] &gt;&gt; He's going to raise you up
[3:06:46] &gt;&gt; if you will yield to him. He's drawing
[3:06:48] you.
[3:06:49] &gt;&gt; He invites you to his table.
[3:06:52] &gt;&gt; Don't turn that away.
[3:06:55] &gt;&gt; When you when you you get to that place
[3:06:56] and you're like, I I I I've just got to
[3:06:58] give up. Well, that's what you need to
[3:06:59] do. Sometimes we get in the way of God
[3:07:02] moving.
[3:07:03] &gt;&gt; We we we try to figure it all out and we
[3:07:06] say, it's got to happen this way or this
[3:07:08] way or this way or it's no way. No, we
[3:07:10] need to let those things go and say,
[3:07:12] God, whatever your will is,
[3:07:14] &gt;&gt; that's what I want in my life. I And I
[3:07:16] just give it all to you. I I I I'm
[3:07:20] relying I can't rely on my strength in
[3:07:22] myself. I'm lame.
[3:07:26] &gt;&gt; And that's what you've got. You embrace
[3:07:27] that and say, "God, I don't know. You're
[3:07:29] you you're my Jehovah Gyra.
[3:07:32] &gt;&gt; You're the only the only one that can
[3:07:33] provide for me
[3:07:36] &gt;&gt; is him. And he's the only one that can
[3:07:38] raise you up, that can lift you up.
[3:07:42] Jeremiah, would you stand with me,
[3:07:43] please? So, I'll I'll I'll note I need
[3:07:45] to be quiet.
[3:07:52] Jeremiah chapter 30 says, "For I will
[3:07:55] restore health unto thee,
[3:07:58] &gt;&gt; the Lord.
[3:07:58] &gt;&gt; I will heal thee of thy wounds,
[3:08:01] &gt;&gt; sayaeth the Lord,
[3:08:03] &gt;&gt; because they called thee an outcast."
[3:08:06] saying, "This is Zion, whom no man
[3:08:09] seeketh after."
[3:08:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:08:11] &gt;&gt; You might find yourself in a place that
[3:08:13] you think, "No, nobody cares about me.
[3:08:17] Nobody cares about the struggle that I'm
[3:08:19] going through. I' I feel like I've I've
[3:08:22] been considered an outcast. I've been
[3:08:23] ostracized."
[3:08:27] Yield to him. He can bring restoration.
[3:08:31] He will bring restoration.
[3:08:35] That's his desire.
[3:08:42] &gt;&gt; Uh the uh the book of Psalms is a is a
[3:08:46] very special
[3:08:48] very special book. I I would love if
[3:08:50] y'all would read with me the book of
[3:08:52] Psalm or just Psalm 23, chapter 23.
[3:09:00] The Lord is my shepherd.
[3:09:04] I shall not want. He maketh me to lie
[3:09:08] down in green pastures. He leadeth me
[3:09:12] beside the still waters.
[3:09:15] He restoth my soul. He leadth me in the
[3:09:20] paths of righteousness for his name's
[3:09:23] sake.
[3:09:25] Yay, though I walk through the valley of
[3:09:27] the shadow of death, I will fear no
[3:09:30] evil,
[3:09:32] for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy
[3:09:35] staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a
[3:09:40] table before me in the presence of mine
[3:09:43] enemies. Thou anointest my head with
[3:09:46] oil. My cup runth over. Surely goodness
[3:09:52] and mercy shall follow me all the days
[3:09:57] of my life. And I will dwell in the
[3:10:00] house of the Lord
[3:10:02] &gt;&gt; forever.
[3:10:03] &gt;&gt; Forever.
[3:10:05] Now you read those words.
[3:10:08] Make that your testimony tonight.
[3:10:12] I I I I kind of wonder maybe was David
[3:10:15] thinking of the the time with
[3:10:17] Mphibicheth whenever he he wrote some of
[3:10:20] those things. I don't know. I don't know
[3:10:22] exactly what was going on, but I in in
[3:10:25] my mind as I read over it and I think of
[3:10:26] the story, I I feel like that that maybe
[3:10:29] he could have been reflecting on on some
[3:10:31] of those things.
[3:10:34] one one more scripture and then I' I've
[3:10:36] asked brother Kate if he would sing a a
[3:10:39] song for us this evening as we as we
[3:10:41] close. And um this is the song that that
[3:10:45] was that was just burning in my heart
[3:10:48] this morning. But in in the in 2
[3:10:51] Corinthians chapter 5:17 says,
[3:10:53] "Therefore, if any man be in Christ,
[3:10:58] &gt;&gt; how many are in Christ tonight? If any
[3:11:01] man be in Christ, he is a new creature.
[3:11:04] &gt;&gt; Old things are passed away, behold, all
[3:11:07] things are become new.
[3:11:11] Maybe this evening you feel like you're
[3:11:14] in the condition of Mphibicheth.
[3:11:16] Maybe you feel broken. Maybe you feel
[3:11:19] crippled or feel damaged or you feel
[3:11:22] defective.
[3:11:23] You feel separated or ostracized or any
[3:11:27] of those things. Something that's
[3:11:28] happened in the past.
[3:11:30] the things that was out of your control.
[3:11:33] We don't have to remain in that
[3:11:35] condition tonight.
[3:11:37] &gt;&gt; We can rest in the arms of God.
[3:11:42] We can rest in him in his strength
[3:11:45] &gt;&gt; as he carries you to his table. Brother
[3:11:49] Kate, would you sing?
[3:11:52] [Music]
[3:12:09] Wounded and forsaken.
[3:12:12] I was shattered by the fall.
[3:12:17] Broken and forgot.
[3:12:20] Feeling lost and all alone.
[3:12:25] Summoned by the key
[3:12:29] into the master's courtle
[3:12:33] lifted by the Savior
[3:12:37] and cradled in his arms.
[3:12:42] I was carried to the table.
[3:12:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:12:50] &gt;&gt; Seated where I don't belong.
[3:12:56] [Music]
[3:12:59] carried to the table,
[3:13:06] swept away by his love.
[3:13:15] And I don't see my brokenness anymore.
[3:13:23] When I'm seated at the table of the
[3:13:27] Lord,
[3:13:29] I'm carried to the table.
[3:13:33] [Music]
[3:13:37] The table of the Lord.
[3:13:41] [Music]
[3:13:46] The fighting thoughts of fear.
[3:13:50] Wondering why he'd call my name.
[3:13:53] &gt;&gt; Never had those question.
[3:13:54] &gt;&gt; Am I good enough to share this cup? This
[3:13:58] world has left me lame.
[3:14:02] Even in my weak weakness, the Savior
[3:14:06] called my name.
[3:14:07] &gt;&gt; Can you hear him calling your name?
[3:14:09] &gt;&gt; And in his holy presence,
[3:14:11] &gt;&gt; oh, in his presence,
[3:14:13] &gt;&gt; I'm healed.
[3:14:14] &gt;&gt; We're healed and unshamed. Hallelujah.
[3:14:18] As I'm carrying to the table,
[3:14:23] [Music]
[3:14:26] &gt;&gt; sitting where I don't belong.
[3:14:33] I'm carrying to the table.
[3:14:41] Swept away by his love.
[3:14:51] &gt;&gt; And I don't see my brokenness anymore.
[3:14:58] As I'm seated at the table of the Lord,
[3:15:04] I'm carried to the table.
[3:15:11] &gt;&gt; Why don't you just let him
[3:15:13] &gt;&gt; lift you up this evening?
[3:15:17] He can lift you up out of your
[3:15:18] brokenness. I'm carrying to the table.
[3:15:22] &gt;&gt; He can lift you up out of your
[3:15:23] heartache.
[3:15:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. seated where I don't belong.
[3:15:30] &gt;&gt; He's the only one that has the strength
[3:15:32] to know.
[3:15:34] &gt;&gt; I'm carried to the table.
[3:15:40] Hallelujah.
[3:15:42] Swept away by his love.
[3:15:51] &gt;&gt; And I don't see my brokenness anymore.
[3:15:57] [Music]
[3:15:59] As I'm seated at the table of the Lord.
[3:16:05] Oh, carry to the table.
[3:16:12] The table of the Lord.
[3:16:22] A fighting thoughts of fear.
[3:16:25] wondering why he'd call my name.
[3:16:29] Am I good enough to share this cup? This
[3:16:33] world has left me lame.
[3:16:37] And even in my weakness,
[3:16:41] the Savior call my name.
[3:16:44] And in his holy presence,
[3:16:48] I'm here
[3:16:50] to shame.
[3:16:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:16:54] As I'm carried to the table,
[3:16:58] [Music]
[3:17:01] I'm seated where I don't belong.
[3:17:08] Oh, carried to the table.
[3:17:14] Oh, thank you, Jesus. Swept away by his
[3:17:19] love.
[3:17:22] [Music]
[3:17:26] And I don't see my brokenness anymore
[3:17:33] as I'm seated at the table of the Lord.
[3:17:39] Oh, carry it to the table.
[3:17:43] [Music]
[3:17:46] &gt;&gt; All you have to do is rest in his
[3:17:47] strength this evening.
[3:17:49] &gt;&gt; Not in your own. Just rest and heal
[3:17:51] tonight.
[3:17:52] Let him carry you. I'll carry to the
[3:17:56] table.
[3:17:57] &gt;&gt; Let he'll heal you.
[3:17:59] Let him remove all of the barriers
[3:18:02] &gt;&gt; where I don't belong.
[3:18:05] &gt;&gt; All the things that's tied you down that
[3:18:08] you felt like it's been imposed tonight.
[3:18:10] &gt;&gt; Carry to the table.
[3:18:16] &gt;&gt; He can offer a full restoration.
[3:18:18] [Music]
[3:18:21] Hallelujah.
[3:18:22] [Music]
[3:18:26] And I don't see my brokenness anymore
[3:18:33] as I'm seated at the table of the Lord.
[3:18:39] Oh, carry to the table.
[3:18:47] table of the Lord.
[3:18:54] I'm carried to the table.
[3:18:59] [Music]
[3:19:02] Seated where I don't belong.
[3:19:09] Oh, carried to the table.
[3:19:13] [Music]
[3:19:17] swept away by his love.
[3:19:24] [Music]
[3:19:26] And I don't see my brokenness anymore.
[3:19:34] As I'm seated at the table of the Lord,
[3:19:40] I'm carried to the table.
[3:19:44] [Music]
[3:19:48] the table of the Lord.
[3:19:56] I'm carried to the table.
[3:20:00] &gt;&gt; There's no place we'd rather be, Lord,
[3:20:02] tonight at your table.
[3:20:04] &gt;&gt; Table of the Lord.
[3:20:12] It's the atmosphere, Lord, that we were
[3:20:14] created
[3:20:16] to dwell in for eternity.
[3:20:19] Your presence.
[3:20:24] We recognize tonight that if we would
[3:20:27] have received what we deserved,
[3:20:31] it would have been death and hell.
[3:20:35] &gt;&gt; But you made a way.
[3:20:37] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. when we couldn't get to
[3:20:40] the table on our own strength,
[3:20:43] you made a way to get us there.
[3:20:48] We sometimes say, Lord, you you rigged
[3:20:52] this
[3:20:53] in our favor.
[3:20:56] Not only did you bring us to the table,
[3:20:59] but everything that you have required of
[3:21:02] us, you have provided for us.
[3:21:07] We really can't lose.
[3:21:10] We really can't lose if we stay in
[3:21:12] fellowship with you and we keep our legs
[3:21:15] under the table.
[3:21:21] There's so many stories
[3:21:24] in this room tonight, Lord, that can
[3:21:27] relate to this great Bible story from
[3:21:32] all angles.
[3:21:34] Some of us were dropped by people who
[3:21:37] truly loved us.
[3:21:41] They didn't disregard us intentionally.
[3:21:45] They just didn't have what we needed.
[3:21:50] They couldn't provide what they didn't
[3:21:52] possess.
[3:21:54] I'm convinced that this nurse
[3:21:57] had taken this little child as her as
[3:22:00] her own responsibility.
[3:22:04] And I'm convinced that she would have
[3:22:07] gladly taken his place in the fall.
[3:22:13] She cared for this child,
[3:22:16] but she didn't have the strength and
[3:22:19] ability to protect him in that moment of
[3:22:22] crisis.
[3:22:24] And he was changed forever.
[3:22:27] There are people in this room, Jesus,
[3:22:29] who were dropped by people like that,
[3:22:32] who loved us,
[3:22:35] but they had been dropped.
[3:22:39] And they had never healed.
[3:22:42] And they were still bleeding years
[3:22:44] later.
[3:22:46] And bleeding people bleed on people.
[3:22:51] Father, there is a bomb.
[3:22:55] There is a bomb in Gilead
[3:22:59] and we thank you for applying it right
[3:23:01] now as we prepare to leave this room.
[3:23:10] A Pharisee passed. A priest
[3:23:14] one after another passed.
[3:23:19] this broken, twisted,
[3:23:22] beaten body laying in the ditch.
[3:23:27] Finally, an an enemy,
[3:23:30] a Samaritan
[3:23:34] passed by and
[3:23:36] poured oil and wine
[3:23:40] in the broken man's wounds. Not only
[3:23:42] that, put him on his own animal, took
[3:23:45] him to the inn and paid his stay.
[3:23:52] Lord Jesus, would you pour in tonight as
[3:23:55] we leave the oil and the wine marri
[3:24:05] heal,
[3:24:09] restore?
[3:24:13] Tonight we have a choice what we what we
[3:24:16] will look at tonight, what we will look
[3:24:18] at tomorrow. Will we will we look at
[3:24:21] those broken feet under the table or
[3:24:27] will we be so thankful that you took us
[3:24:32] in our brokenness and you are still for
[3:24:35] many of us you're still healing us.
[3:24:39] We grow impatient
[3:24:42] but the process
[3:24:45] is divine.
[3:24:47] pour in right now. Somebody lift your
[3:24:50] faith.
[3:24:53] &gt;&gt; You may not be able to relate to this at
[3:24:55] all, but the one next to you may have
[3:24:58] come for a word like what you've heard.
[3:25:01] You heard two words tonight,
[3:25:04] and you may not have needed one or the
[3:25:06] other, but the reality is somebody here
[3:25:10] needed to hear again
[3:25:13] that it's all under the table. It's all
[3:25:16] under the blood. if you'll place it
[3:25:17] there and leave it there. Father, right
[3:25:20] now as faith lifts up in this room,
[3:25:23] we we ask you to draw to drive deep in
[3:25:27] our heart
[3:25:29] identity.
[3:25:31] &gt;&gt; We are no longer orphans.
[3:25:34] We are no longer rejected. We are no
[3:25:37] longer forsaken. We are no longer
[3:25:40] handicapped
[3:25:42] &gt;&gt; because you have called us and then
[3:25:45] carried us to your table.
[3:25:49] &gt;&gt; So we will not leave here tonight merely
[3:25:52] a product of our broken feet. But our
[3:25:57] identity is now new in Christ. And we
[3:26:00] leave here as hes of the king, trusting
[3:26:05] that you will heal every part of us that
[3:26:08] still stands in need. Jesus, you're real
[3:26:10] and your your heart is for us.
[3:26:14] If we could just see,
[3:26:17] you're for us.
[3:26:19] Bless those who have labored tonight in
[3:26:21] the word and those who have pulled in
[3:26:24] faith. bless the brief time of
[3:26:27] fellowship that we will have now and
[3:26:30] bless the food that has been prepared.
[3:26:34] May we have quick fellowship with one
[3:26:38] another and uh and and come back
[3:26:42] tomorrow
[3:26:44] for whatever you have for us.
[3:26:48] I feel your presence.
[3:26:52] My body says, "You're you're very
[3:26:54] tired."
[3:26:57] But my spirit says, "Lord, thank you.
[3:26:59] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank
[3:27:02] you. Thank you."
[3:27:04] Cuz I believe you put your finger on
[3:27:07] somebody's need here tonight. I praise
[3:27:09] you. In the name of Jesus Christ, we ask
[3:27:11] this blessing.
[3:27:13] Isn't the Lord good?
[3:27:18] I don't know about you, but I get so
[3:27:20] tired of the same old same old.
[3:27:25] &gt;&gt; I like something a little different.
[3:27:30] &gt;&gt; I I like a variety.
[3:27:33] &gt;&gt; I've spent too many times, it's been
[3:27:35] years, but I've spent a lot of times at
[3:27:38] a smorges board.
[3:27:40] Not just because I wanted to eat so
[3:27:43] much, but I like a spoon of that and a
[3:27:47] little piece of that and just
[3:27:50] I love it sometime when we can have that
[3:27:52] in the in the spirit and we can have
[3:27:55] different needs and different
[3:27:56] ministries.
[3:27:59] If all were pastors,
[3:28:02] if all were evangelists, if all were
[3:28:04] apostles, if all were prophets, if all
[3:28:08] were teachers,
[3:28:11] he would be a an odd God.
[3:28:17] &gt;&gt; He's not four-fingered.
[3:28:19] He's five.
[3:28:22] &gt;&gt; Sing this as you leave. Go in peace.
[3:28:26] Benjamin, do you have any voice? I just
[3:28:28] want to sing this old chorus as we go
[3:28:30] out. A child of the king. I want
[3:28:33] everybody to leave here tonight. Don't
[3:28:36] go down there to that fellowship hall
[3:28:39] and and talk about who dropped you and
[3:28:44] who failed you and what ministry let you
[3:28:47] down.
[3:28:49] &gt;&gt; I'm going to run you off the property if
[3:28:50] I hear you cuz you're missing it.
[3:28:55] That's the one thing about our identity
[3:28:57] being changed
[3:28:59] &gt;&gt; is is sometimes we really don't know who
[3:29:03] we are anymore.
[3:29:05] &gt;&gt; So don't go down there and talk about
[3:29:07] preachers or peoples or stepmothers or
