Would you lift up a clap of praise to him who is worthy? Worthy, worthy, worthy is the lamb. How we bless you Jesus. We give you praise for you are worthy, worthy, worthy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He is worthy of all praise and adoration. &gt;&gt; And as we go to prayer today, he is worthy of our praise no matter what our need is. He said with thanksgiving made your make your requests known unto him. That's what we do today. We thank him for who he is and what he's doing. Do you have a need by the lifting of the hand today all over the house there are needs out across the stream. We know there are many needs. where we're remembering brother Daniel and sister Anna in Arkansas packing up brother Eddie and sister Janet Miller getting ready to move this way. We pray for all of them asking the Lord to strengthen them keeping them sound in body and in their minds as all of this transition is happening. We pray for them. Sister Sharon's mother is uh still quite unstable up and down. Oxygen up and down, heart rate up and down, blood pressure up and down. And they both need our prayers today. It's a lot. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Sister Sharon can't leave her when she's in that kind of a condition because she's dizzy and she she could easily fall. And at her age and her condition, she doesn't need a broke bone. Ask the Lord to move. Sister Flo, I assume, is still fighting to get better. We want to hold her up to the Lord in prayer. Sister Rebecca Shephard reached out to say she wasn't feeling well. The Yoviches are still in a battle, I guess, to get over all of their sickness. And there are several others that we want to remember to the Lord in prayer. And Sister Anna Christine had a couple of requests for family members. One is an aunt who fell yesterday and recently diagnosed with osteoporosis and fractures to eight eight to 10 ribs and uh those fractures that's horrible. those fractures punctured her lungs. Supposed to have surgery today. A believer, let's pray the Lord to undertake. And and then a request for a brother uh Caleb who was from brother David Morse's church who had an accident yesterday. Thrown from the car &gt;&gt; and it landed on him, &gt;&gt; fractured his pelvis and his punctured his bladder waiting on surgery. Same hospital that Iran is in. That touches my heart. The enemy is out to destroy. But he is a defeated foe. &gt;&gt; He's defeated. &gt;&gt; Remember all of those needs that have come in and I have an unspoken request concerning Jerusalem that I'd like for the Lord to give me a complete and total answer about. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm tired of worrying over it. I want his peace and I want I want his answers. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I think that's all of mine I can remember. Brother Paul Drown needs our prayers. He's fighting a battle, believing God. He was back in the hospital at some point. I don't know for sure if he's there today or not, but he really needs a miracle. Our God is a miracle working God. &gt;&gt; Gabriel's sister needs our prayers today. She needs a miracle. Sister Elizabeth Our God is well able to do much more than we could ever dream. &gt;&gt; Back in July, we had heard about a young man who is the son of someone that goes to daddy's church. and I saw him at a funeral. He looked all well. This was back in July, but it was just two weeks ago that we heard the testimony. 56 years old, massive stroke, brain bleed. According to the testimony, the doctor that took the clot off of his brain said it was the biggest one that he had ever removed successfully. But still, the side of his mouth was drooped, his arm useless. His dad was in the hospital room feeding him stuff dribbling out of his mouth. Looked out the window, said, "Oh, brother and sister Gley are coming in." That would be my mom and dad. It was at that moment according to his testimony he said everything is going to be all right. Later would tell it was at that moment that he was saved but 10 days later he went back to work. &gt;&gt; No signs of the stroke. a miracle that God had performed. &gt;&gt; Our Lord is still the same &gt;&gt; healing Jesus. &gt;&gt; He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; We don't know all of the ways of our Lord, but his ways are perfect. And we trust him. No matter what things look like, we trust him because he holds us in his hand. And that's who we look to to today as we're getting ready to go to prayer. Would you sing this course? I cast all of my cares upon you. I lay all of my burdens down at your feet. Brother R.J., will you get ready to come and pray, please? I cast all my cares upon you. I lay all of my burdens down at your feet. Anytime I don't know just what to do, I cast all my cares upon you. Sing again, please. Oh, I cast all my cares upon you. I lay all of my burdens down at your feet. Anytime. I don't know what to do. I cast all my cares upon you. &gt;&gt; Lord, I feel very often we find ourselves in the words of that song where we say, "I don't know what to do. And I thank you, Lord, that we don't need to know what to do. &gt;&gt; That's for sure. &gt;&gt; Because we serve a father, a God, a risen Lord, &gt;&gt; that is mindful of every need. I thank you, oh God, that you are a high priest, that you ascended on high and then you sat down because the sin question has been answered &gt;&gt; with finality, Lord, because of your blood and the price that you paid. &gt;&gt; And so we come to you today, Lord, as your children. And we do have we we we do, Lord. We're in need and we depend upon you, oh God. And so for every question, Lord, that we carry in our hearts, every need that we have in our lives, we look to you, oh God, as the source, as our provision, and as our provider. Lord, I ask that you would come today and that you would minister to every need and to every heart. Lord that we would be open to receive of your life and your light. Oh God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord I pray for brother Shelley today. Lord for the need that we have in Jerusalem. Lord I ask for divine clarity to come for strategy. Lord maybe it's not the whole path but the next step. I ask oh God that it would be illuminated that it would be so clear oh God and that we would take it and move in faith. Lord we pray for our sister Flo that you would minister in her body today brother Drown that you would minister your life and your healing. Oh God provision for for healing has been made in the atonement and we lay claim on it today &gt;&gt; in the name of Yeshua the Messiah. Oh God, &gt;&gt; Lord, I pray that every lie in our lives would be exposed by your truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, that light would have preeminence in this house and in our lives. And we just pray today, Father, that whatever your purpose is for today, for this service, for this moment, that it would be manifested in our lives. Give us ears to hear. Give us hearts to receive, oh God, and come and be praised and glorified. You said, "If I be lifted up, I will draw all men unto me today." And Lord, just draw our hearts and our minds and our lives to you. &gt;&gt; That is so true. &gt;&gt; We give you permission, oh God, to have your will in this place. Be glorified, Lord, in the name of Yeshua, the Messiah. We pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise you Lord. &gt;&gt; We give you praise Lord for you are good. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. To God be glory. Great things he is doing. You may have your seats today. It's good to be in the house of the Lord to have you gathered with us. Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised in the mountain of the Lord in the city of his holiness. We're we're we're grateful that we have breath today to be able to praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's worthy to be praised. &gt;&gt; We're very glad to have in the service today, Brother Gabriel Tawari and his wife, Sister Rebecca, and their five boys. &gt;&gt; Yeah, there is five there. Brother Hawk has gone to Ann Arbor where brother Gabriel pastors. He's been there uh several times to minister there for brother Gabriel and the congregation in their outreach ministry that they have. And I'm going to ask brother Gabriel if he'll come and greet the church. And perhaps he and his family have a song they'd like to share with us today, a testimony. Come, brother Gabriel. We're glad that you and your family are in the house of the Lord with us today. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Good morning. Uh God bless you. &gt;&gt; We bring uh greetings from the Little Flock Church in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The there's uh certainly many of them who have streamed the service here and our last uh meeting of brother Shelley was probably over 20 uh years ago. I'll I'll tell my uh my memory my last memory of him after service. Brother Wes was trying to convince me to tell it right now, but I'll tell &gt;&gt; Thank you. Good. &gt;&gt; U but it's it's it's such a such a blessing uh to to uh be here. It's it's been on our heart for nearly a decade to come and and visit and we've been praying about it for for a long time and and the Lord opened a door. So, we are so happy uh to be here and worship uh with with all of you and just enjoy the word uh this this morning. Maybe I could read a scripture. And we we've we've had uh un unfortunately our our entire church got hit with this sickness that's going around and uh we we had hoped to prepare a song but we we may we may try to do something anyhow um if we can get enough breath to sing but I'm going to read from uh St. John chapter 15 two verses and uh then I'll uh call my family up and introduce them to you. This is uh John chapter 15 and verse 8. And it says, "Herein is my father glorified that you bear much fruit." &gt;&gt; So shall you be my disciples. And maybe we could jump down to verse 16. You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you &gt;&gt; and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain. Amen. &gt;&gt; That whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name, he may give it to you. And these are precious scriptures uh to me. Few years ago, I I wrote a song kind of uh along the theme in uh John 15. And it always encourages me whenever I come to the Lord that it wasn't my idea to come to him, but it was his idea that that I come to him. And &gt;&gt; and it's not God's idea that we be poor, but it's God's idea that we we be fruitful &gt;&gt; and he gets glory. And you know, sometimes we we look up at the at the sunrise or the sunset or the earth and we admire the beauty of the Lord and we see the glory in that. But the the the way he wanted to get the most glory was in his church. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; And uh and I I still have trouble wrapping my mind around it because it's so humbling that he would he would want that. Uh but the the song we're going to sing maybe family could could uh come up. I'll I'll say the words before I sing it just in case I lose my breath. We've been we were trying to sing at brother Hawk's house the other night and I I could get a few words out and start uh coughing but we trust it'll be better. But the the song the words of the song say, "I am yours, O Lord. I belong to you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, I belong to you. You have bought me with your precious blood. My life is not my own. So use me for your glory and overflow so all men may know &gt;&gt; the living God is alive in me. &gt;&gt; Christ is alive in me. The second verse says so let me heir abide in you and you abide in me and let your words abide in me and open up my heart to ask according to your will. &gt;&gt; Amen. and glorify and glorify the father in the fruit I bear as your joy becomes my own. And then there's a a little bridge where it gets a little the the tempo changes a bit and it says, "So glorify yourself. Glorify yourself. Glorify yourself in me and open up my heart to ask within your will. Glorify yourself in me." And so, um, I'll introduce my family quickly. This is my lovely wife, uh, Rebecca. Uh, this is my oldest, Amen. And then we have Isaiah and Timothy and Abel. And let's let's let's go. So, we're not hiding behind the pulpit. All right. And this this this is Adam, Michael. All right. Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. Uh, so um what should should I Is there a microphone at the at the piano? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. So we can Yeah, you can if if you catch the word I I wish I would have got the words um up there so that you could have uh sung it with me, but if you catch the words while we're singing it, please please uh join along. This I I wrote wrote the song to be sung as kind of like a hymn congregational. So that was that was the idea. Some of you met sister's parents, brother and sister. They were here once. I know you share with me share with me all day. I am yours, oh Lord. I belong to you &gt;&gt; Lord. I belong to you. &gt;&gt; You have bought me with your preious blood. My life is not my own. So use me for your glory and overflow and overflow. &gt;&gt; How does it go after that? Lost &gt;&gt; the guy. &gt;&gt; No, that's not it. I forgot my own song. Let me start it over. &gt;&gt; I am yours, O Lord. I belong to you. Lord, I belong to you. &gt;&gt; You have bought me with your preious blood. My life is not my own. So use me for your gloryy and overflow so all men may know the living God is alive in me. Christ is alive in me. Oh, let me air abide in you and you abide in me. And let your works abide in me. and open up my heart to ask according to your will. And glorify and glorify the father in the fruit I bear. As your joy becomes my own. So glorify yourself. Glorify yourself. Glorify yourself in me. And open up my heart to ask within your will. Glorify yourself in me. That part's easy. You can sing it with me. So glorify yourself. Glorify yourself. Glorify yourself in me. And open up my heart to ask within your will. Glorify yourself in me. I am yours, oh Lord. I belong to you, &gt;&gt; Lord. I belong to you. &gt;&gt; You have bought me with your preious blood. My life is not my own. So use me for your glory and overflow so all men may know the living God is alive in me. Christ is alive in me. Praise God. Beautiful. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Thank you for that beautiful song that the Lord gave to you that we could worship &gt;&gt; him. It's what the Lord wants it. He wants to be glorified through us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, it is 2026. You write a check, you have to learn to write a new number on it. Young people don't know much about writing checks these days. Everything is digital. I still live in the Ice Age. I mean, um, I'm an old guy that still writes checks and I got the first one right and I got the second one right and that's all I've written. So, so far so good. But it is a new year, 2026. Jesus Christ is still alive as much as he was in 2025 and even more so to the bride of Jesus Christ because she is pressing on to the higher calling in Christ Jesus knowing that he is perfecting the elect lady &gt;&gt; in this end time getting her ready for that catching away. We have had a mindset in time past that we were just going to be sucked out of here and that it wouldn't matter what condition we were in nearly. But the Lord is revealing to us that he's bringing an elect lady to her perfection &gt;&gt; to get her to that point where that there is that catching away where that the dead in Christ shall rise first and then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up with them and those of us that are left here are being made perfect in the image of Jesus Christ. We cannot do it in and of oursel but precept upon precept gradually gradually gradually suddenly that is the way the word is working in our lives and we're here today for another installment of the word of God. Before we do we're going to receive the tithe and the offering. I'm going to ask brother Ias and brother Austin Yantis to uh come to you for the tithe and offering today. Give as giving unto the Lord. The Lord is working mightily and we want to remain a part of what he is doing, what he has called us to, staying in our lane, not trying to do somebody else's job, but we're trying to fulfill the commission that the Lord gave to us. And as we give to the Lord, we give to him and we bless you in the name of the Lord. Would you sing this song as we're uh giving to the Lord and as we're preparing our heart for the preaching of the word today? I'm not on an ego trip. I'm nothing on my own. I make mistakes and often slip. Just common flesh and bone. But I'll prove someday just what I say. I'm of a special kind. When he was on the cross, I was on his mind. Yes, he knew me. Yet he loved me. He whose glory makes the heaven shine. so unworthy of such mercy. Oh, when he was on the cross, I was on his mind. The look of love was on his face. The thorns were on his head. The blood was on that scarlet robe. It stained it crimson red. Though his eyes were on the crowd that day, he looked ahead in time. When he was on the cross, I was on. Will you stand with us? Yes, he knew me. Yet he loved me. He whose glory makes the heaven shine. So unworthy. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. of such mercy. Yet when he was on the cross, I was on. Sing again. Oh, he knew me. &gt;&gt; He knew me. &gt;&gt; He knew me. Yet he loves you. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He whose glory makes the heaven shine. I was so unworthy. Yes. of such mercy. Yet when he was on the cross, I was on his mind. Sing just a little more. The look of love was on his face, and the thorns were on his head. And the blood was on that old scarlet robe. It was stained a crimson red. And though his eyes were on the crowd that day, he looked ahead in time. For when he was on the cross, he had his little bride on his mind. For he knew me. Oh, hallelujah. Yet he loved me. I don't know how. I don't know how he could &gt;&gt; his glory makes the heaven shine. Oh, so unworthy of such mercy. Yet when he was on the cross yet when he was on the cross, I was on his mine. And he walks with me. And he talks with me. And he tells me I am his own. And the joy We share as we tear there none other has ever. Thank him one more time that he walks with you and he walks with me and he talks And he tells me I am his own. And the joy we share as we tear there. Another as ever known. Can we give the Lord another hand clap of praise? He's worthy of them all. Bless his name. Bless his wonderful, holy name. Thank you for your presence, Lord. Thank you for your wonderful love to us today. Thank you for every blessing. We praise you. You may be seated for just a moment. It's wonderful to see you in the house of the Lord today. I can't say that many of you seem chipper, but you're here and that's a blessing. And uh maybe you will press into something before you leave and you'll perk up a little bit. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; That's your first warning. We we have so much to be motivated about the goodness of God. Uh one year behind us and a and a fresh spanking brand new one ahead of us. And as brother Gley so beautifully said, Jesus is Lord. He's Lord over here just like he was Lord over there. &gt;&gt; He's worthy of all of our praises. And uh this too shall pass and the church will be full again. all this sickness will be over and we'll see our our folks again. Some have been out. Uh I didn't mention Sister Megan Kino, but she reached out. She's still not feeling well. And several others, but they're they're pressing on and we know where our healing is. And some are just being particularly kind to us because they know uh how things are easily transmitted uh through a church of a a little family church like this where we're close to one another. Uh I want to uh give God praise for a beautiful tribute to Sister Williams on Tuesday evening. The presence of the Lord was here. Thank you for being here. We had a wonderful number here and a wonderful meal afterwards and all of you folks who without complaint cooked amazing meal and and brought it and served the family and it was just it was wonderful. It was what I desired that it would be a fitting tribute for a life well-lived among us. And uh I'm just thankful that she's safely home and I'm looking forward to a a a glad reunion on on on the sunny banks of sweet deliverance. &gt;&gt; I'm looking forward to it. I I wouldn't care if it was sooner rather than later. I am so thankful for it's more than a promise to us. It's a reality. &gt;&gt; That realm is real. It's more real than the one we're walking in this morning. &gt;&gt; I assure you of that. Uh we want to give God praise for uh all that was accomplished then uh for that evening. And we're glad to be gathered in the house of the Lord again today. No need to uh have a meeting to say goodbye to the old year and uh and hello to the new year. this uh is just about as uh rooted in in pagan things like like some of the other celebrations that people love. God doesn't keep the pope's calendar. Uh he doesn't he doesn't keep the pope's calendar. He made his own. He created his own and he moves by that. And we're thankful that we have some understanding, not all, but we have some understanding of the times and the seasons of the Lord and that they they move by God's design and not by not by the Catholic system. Very thankful for that. Today is Joshua Rivers's birthday. Where is he? Is he out? No, he's up in the sound booth. Today is Joshua Rivers's birthday and I'm very happy to be in the house of God with him today. and wish him a very happy birthday. I appreciate all of his help. He's very kind and very helpful to me and I appreciate it very much many many many times behind the scenes and I'm very thankful for that. Uh we want to uh also uh mention that today is Miss Wanda's birthday and many of us have uh loved her as a sweet and dear friend through the years. And I mention it because for many years Joshua and Miss Wanda celebrated their birthdays together and we had a wonderful time. And so if if she crosses your mind uh today or in the future, lift her up to the Lord. Uh that God's perfect plan always be accomplished in her life. She has been a sweet friend to Stacy and I and a and a real sweet encouragement through the years. TW 25 years ago today, I was carried in the spirit and saw a beautiful white eagle dropping a pyramid, a capstone into the water. And I watched the waters roll back, disintegrating the bank, and I saw the goodness of God and the promise of of a better day, a brighter day for this little bride. I still believe it 25 years later. I I know that it hasn't completed, but it's it's coming. And may we walk through 2025 behind us, 2026 now ahead of us. May we walk through it believing God for for Zachariah's grace. Grace, we need it. &gt;&gt; We need it. We need grace. Grace to keep moving forward. Uh can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And we missed some birthdays last week. I always have them wrote down, but sometimes we're directed and we get up here and our thoughts are already on something else and we we forget to mention it. So, I'm just going to pretend like uh these are current. They're no longer current. But we have brother Brent and Sister Trish back uh from uh Tucson. They were gone about what two months it seemed like. Not to them, but to us. And they had a 10year anniversary while they were gone. I think they'll make it 10 years. So, we'll say happy anniversary to them. We enjoy their friendship and the fellowship that we have with them. Uh, also Zachary's birthday was Tuesday and we didn't mention it in the service on Tuesday night being a memorial, but we're thankful for him. Uh, I still can see him uh little baby in a carrier uh in the parking lot of Brother Baker's church in Tucson. And uh Sister Alita showing him off to me in the in the back of the church outside. And now uh he's a big boy, all grown up. Not as big as he was though, but he's all grown up and he's got amazing family of his own. And I I'm glad to mention his birthday. And Sister Wagner, uh, Guju's sister Judith's mom had an 88th birthday this week behind us, and we thank God for her life. And then Hawk, he slipped in with the birthday, and he is certainly getting old. I he used to be young and and now I'm old like the scripture says. But anyway, uh I love him. I'm so thankful for him. Tiffany had a birthday. I don't see her this morning, but she had a birthday yesterday. And Sophia had a birthday. Is that right? Sophia's birthday. And she turned three, four. My goodness. I don't know how this happens. Did I miss somebody? Did I miss somebody this coming week? Praise the Lord. All that stuff is over. Thank God. We're done with that. Amen. Is there anything else we're looking forward to? We don't know what our February meeting will look like, but we're already looking forward to that. And appreciate that beautiful reel that they released this week. And boy, doesn't it just make you want to praise the Lord? One little brother was concerned about the fact that that wasn't a hymn. Well, I love hymns. Let me say it again. I do believe in hymns. I love hymns. Hymns are wonderful. I grew up with the Redback himnil and I don't think they write songs like that anymore. They're all amazing. But I would like to tell my dear message friends around the world that inspiration didn't stop with Fanny Crosby. &gt;&gt; He's still inspiring songs today. &gt;&gt; And they don't all have to sound like 50s either. They can they don't have to. My That's my preference. Everybody knows what I like. &gt;&gt; But we don't come to bring what we like. We come to to bring what brings him glory, &gt;&gt; brings him praise and honor, and it's going to sound a little different, but if we sing it unto the Lord with all of our hearts, somebody say, "Well, you do you know who wrote that?" No, I don't always know who wrote it, but I know if it resonates with my spirit, and I know if it lines up with the word &gt;&gt; that I know. &gt;&gt; And if it's that, then I know that it brings honor and glory to the Lord. We're blessed this morning. We're just blessed to be his children. &gt;&gt; And uh there's a lot of uncertainty around us, but God is certain, &gt;&gt; never changes, &gt;&gt; never fails. And have I told you that I'll be so glad when my grandbaby gets home from Washington State? I need her bad. And she's coming home Tuesday night. And if brother Gabriel will preach a long time, then I uh I'll still be awake and alert when she gets home on Tuesday night late. Thank you, musicians. I I want to sing, but I better not. God bless you all. Let's stand again. Brother Gabriel, it is wonderful to have you and your family with us. The song was a blessing. The fellowship that we had last night was a blessing to me. And uh I I I came home refreshed. Uh just I don't I don't get out too much on a Saturday, but I I'm certainly glad that I did. Um there are times that we can be in a setting like that and we feel drained. And there are other times we leave a a meeting like that, a little fellowship, and we realize that we're not drained. In fact, we've gained virtue somehow. Ain't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; That's how it ought to be when we're with God's people. Now, if you talk about football all the time, like some of you do, you're not going to leave with virtue. If you talk about disc golf and all the other things that turn some of you folks on and make you talk about them all the time, you're not going to leave with anything extra to get you through. But if you'll spend just a little time talking about the promises of God and his faithfulness to you through the years, you'll leave with more than you had when you went in. &gt;&gt; Because there's something about getting those licks of fire together. &gt;&gt; And I'm sorry, but you just don't get the same portion streaming a service that you do when you're there. Thank God for streaming. In fact, we have people all over. God bless saints in Arkansas. That's Miller's there getting ready to pack getting packed up and ready to come. And love to the saints in southern Norway uh today. And uh those brother Gossman and and family in Indiana. And uh of course I don't know some of these handles here. I can't always tell by the handle who who they are. Brother Howard and uh brother Terrell Howard uh I I knew him many years ago. an old friend watching in Columbus and other other places around the world. Uh I'm thankful for those folks and I'm glad that we can have a part of their lives. But I think they would agree there's nothing like being in the in the corporate setting where where more than an individual anointing is distributed. But the the gathering together of the licks of fire, like brother Brandham told us, you bring all those licks together. My something is bound to happen if we come with faith believing. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's turn in our Bibles this morning back to the book of Judges. It is 12:20 for the clock watchers. It's about your nap time, isn't it? And um we're going to go on anyway. I believe God has something for us. And I want to go to Judges chapter 16. And I I think we will I I I think we'll go back to verse 16. And it came to pass when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death, that he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor upon mine head. For I have been a Nazerite unto God from my mother's womb. If I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak and be like any other man. And when Delilah saw, and we know this uh this Delilah, her name means to weaken, to impoverish, to drain. And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, "Come up this once, for he hath showed me all his heart." And then the Lord of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand, and she made him sleep upon her knees, and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head, and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him. That's a pretty serious thing that was taking place in Samson's being. Would you say amen? &gt;&gt; And then in verse 20, and she said, "The Philistines be upon thee, Samson, and he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and do what? Shake myself." And he wised not that the Lord was departed from him. I think that's one of the saddest sentences and and maybe in the Bible. There's a few others that seem to rank up there as well. I know that he deserved this moment of nothingness because of his compromise. But my heart's tender toward the servant of the Lord. It breaks my heart to think that what he had depended on, he so casually forfeited and then recognized the vacuum of it when it was gone and he wished not. Oh, he wished not that the spirit of the Lord had departed. In in order for that to happen, somebody has to wake up and realize that he has left. The saddest tragedy of churches today is the Lord has taken his spirit back and nobody seems to notice &gt;&gt; because they continue in their program and going through the motions without spirit life. It'll never last. It'll never produce life. It'll never bring deliverance without the spirit of the Lord. It's just motion. It's just movement. But it's not spirit movement. It's carnal movement and it will never work. In fact, as in the case of Abraham, what is produced with the loins of the mind &gt;&gt; will bring something forth to mock, not to make, but to mock what God desires to do. We call every spirit like that down in the authority of Jesus Christ. And we declare today that the truth of God's word will prevail. And we cry out in spirit right now to a sleeping bride across this nation and through the world. Wake up, oh sleeper. Wake up. For this is the day of your redemption. This is the hour that he would desire not to visit you but to occupy you, to change you and manifest who he is in you. And we just stand against every lying, distracting demon of hell that has come to woo the the sleep upon the servants of the Lord who lay like comeos in the lap of Delilah. We call for generals to wake up and soldiers to wake up. Men of God to wake up now. You have slept enough. It's time to be alert and to be on the wall. For this is the hour that we have waited for. The final subduing of every demon power that has marched against the little bride of Jesus Christ. It's time to take our place. It's time to take our authority. That which he has invested in us. Lord, we thank you that you have not left us here to occupy alone, to fight alone, but you are in us, not just with us, but in us, and you're fighting through us if we would so take our stand. Lord, even in this house right now, we call for sleepers to wake up &gt;&gt; and hear the voice of the spirit. You're not rapture ready and the rapture is upon us. Wake up. Wake up. Recognize the hour. This is our prayer, Lord. This is our decree. This is what we believe is needed and necessary. And we ask for your grace to finish it. In the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. And the saint said, &gt;&gt; "Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated this morning. He's here and we ought to welcome him." &gt;&gt; Well, there's a lot to say in the message once more. New York, New York, paragraph 117, Brother Brandham said, "What caused it? What was the cause of Samson's fall? He let a woman lure him away from the promise of God." What is our excuse? What has lured us away from the promise of God? He said, "That's exactly. We all know that he had seven locks." This is paragraph 117. He had seven locks and he was born. His birth path, his birth path was to be a what? An oddfellow. That's not the lodge. Oddfellow's lodge. That's God's nuts. You understand? The odd ones. Are you embarrassed of us or are you one of us? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "It's all right to be one. It's all right to be a nut. As long as you're threaded to the right bolt." How many of you know who the right bolt is? &gt;&gt; His name is Jesus Christ. I want to be locked down on him. Don't you? &gt;&gt; I'm going to say that again. And I'm going to give you an opportunity to say amen. &gt;&gt; I want to be locked on to him. &gt;&gt; Not just Sunday morning, &gt;&gt; not just Tuesday night, but I want to be locked on to him every day. Every day, every hour. I don't ever know when he's coming. &gt;&gt; I don't ever know when he's coming. Sometimes he comes on the way to work, uh, over to the church. He He comes without invitation. I want my heart to be ready to receive him &gt;&gt; and I want to hear him &gt;&gt; sometimes at my desk, sometimes in the shower. Don't think about it. He He comes and I I don't want to be so busy with anything or anybody &gt;&gt; that that I can't welcome him because he doesn't come just to come. He comes to bring something. He's here this morning to bring something. How many of you need something? &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I don't know what I need." That's not necessary. You don't even have to know what you need. All you have to do is get in. &gt;&gt; If the angel of the Lord is troubling the water, all you have to do is get in the water because he already knows what you need. If you need healing, he's got it. &gt;&gt; If you need direction, he's got it. If you need understanding, he's got it. Just get in the water. &gt;&gt; And in order to do that, you got to be awake. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's grievious to me that some folks would uh use this time for for for sleep when this is a time to be your most alert &gt;&gt; because God has something for us. &gt;&gt; I know that. Not because I'm here. Oh, no sir. But because he is. Are you are you are you here? That's the question. Let's be together. He said, uh, you know, uh, he let this woman lure him until she shaved his oddness off. The thing that distinguished him from all others was his perpetual Nazerite vow. And the prophet is telling us that these seven locks of hair symbolized more than just a Nazerite vow. It symbolized that which sets him apart from all the others around. &gt;&gt; And that's what has happened in the religious uh religious realm, the church realm. That's what's happened. Pentecost has allowed the the world, the enemy to shave off any oddness. any peculiarity that the church used to carry because they wanted to be politically correct and they wanted to be user friendly and seeker friendly and the thing that used to set us apart. The prayer meeting, the gifts of the spirit in operation, the wailing and calling out on the Lord, those things have been shaved off because they make some people uncomfortable. And this is what happened. And there was no there was no distinction anymore. He had laid his head in her lap and that which distinguished him from others was shaved off. And he said, and that's the same thing that's happened to the church. And and I want to be real plain with you today. I I don't think that it would be um you know just or fair to just point out there at the mistakes that other movements have made and other churches have made. I I think we have to keep updating if we're going to be here another few years. I think we we have to keep updating and making sure that we're keeping up with what the spirit of the Lord desires to do. And the reality is we're almost in need of another exodus. and and uh I think I already made it, you know, because we we're called out to be called out and and then we we love where we are and then we find out that the same thing that has happened where we were is now happening where we are. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And we need somehow to be called out again. This doesn't necessarily mean geographically, does it? It just means to another realm, to another place, to another high spot, following again the the marching orders of the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords, desiring not to fit. There was a tremendous pressure uh upon us for many years to fit a system. And I'm thankful it was even in my own family. I could feel the pressure because the young people out there didn't understand. We were mocked for so many different things. They mocked us because our young couples didn't kiss at the altar. They mocked us because we didn't exchange wedding bands in the ceremony. They mocked us because we have a a Torah scroll in the church. It's all right to have icons, idols, and pictures, but don't dare have the first five books of the Bible on display. And they mocked us for this, and they heard somebody prophesy, and they mocked us for that. And somebody had a vision, and they mock you for that. And someone dreamed a dream, and they mock you for that. And you feel pressure to fit. That's what's happened around the world. A pressure has come to fit. But there's something on the inside of the inside that that rises up in us and says the box isn't big enough. Amen. You You can't box the anointing in. You can't box the Holy Ghost and fire in. You've got to let him have his way. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is not in it. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is he. There's only one eternal spirit of God. &gt;&gt; And he manifested as we understand in different ways, but he's now in us. &gt;&gt; And he now desires to talk in us, not only to us, but in us and through us. And he desires to move us uh to a higher place of faith because there's a there's a work that must be finished. There is yet an end time evangelism that must be finished. He preached it. You know, it must be finished. I I this week I was listening to some of the things that Brother Brandham said uh about the future of the message and what his vision was. He even used that term, what my vision is to move this thing to the nations of the world. And and I'm thinking as I read this, here we are nearly 60 years later and this has not happened. There's not been a training place. There's not been much training. There hasn't been much understanding on on how the spirit of God desires to work in an end time bride. There hasn't been a lot why he said we we we'll we should get together and sit down and talk about these things. Well, I've been to some efforts uh of that. I've been to some carnal uh you know um settings where where that seemed to be the purpose, but it became just an argument over quotes. And how many of you know that doesn't produce life? Arguing over scripture doesn't produce life. Arguing over anything doesn't produce life. But so many things that brother Brandham said he hoped to see, he wanted to see, he longed to see in the furtherance of this message, we recognize that it has never happened. Some can just chalk it up and say, "Well, it didn't happen that way." But there's a few of us that read it and we catch it and we say, "Lord, if this was something you put on his heart, then it must yet be." And and if it must yet be, we ought to be praying that it come to pass. We ought to be praying that it move among us. We ought to be praying that a final generation of people could be prepared as a remnant from the bride &gt;&gt; because she'll not be bound by any kind of denominational system. She'll be totally free to worship God according to scripture. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; And she will have thus sayaeth the Lord or she will keep still. &gt;&gt; I want that. I believe that. I'm looking for that. And this was a part of the multiplication and the distribution of this message that the prophet longed for. Not a people who would cross every uh every tea and dot every eye and call it all thus sayeth the Lord, but a people that would do as he instructed us to do. take it to the word and once you see it placed in the word of God, you've got a foundation to stand on that all of hell cannot move you. &gt;&gt; How many of you know if you're standing on the word, not even hell can move you. &gt;&gt; But we need a revelation. We need a quickening, an individual personal quickening. Uh many have believed that because brother Brandham, they've recognized brother Brandham, they see the ministry of brother Brandham that they're going to get a free pass to rapture. But that is not the way the Bible teaches it. &gt;&gt; It's going to require the same life that was in Jesus Christ. The magnet draws the same life. &gt;&gt; You understand? The deep calleth to the deep. The magnet only pulls the same life that was in Christ. How many of you want to be so full of the same life that was in Jesus Christ that all of your old paradigms crumble and you surrender? It's not about more effort. It's not even about more uh discipline. It's not even about more Bible reading, although we must read the Bible. And brother Brandon said, "One of the things we could never do too much is pray." But people get in this religious struggle &gt;&gt; to pray more, to read more. And what comes out of that is usually just flesh. But if we could surrender and use the time that we can capture as quality time to be still, to hear his heartbeat, you you think you know. I think I know what God needs to do for my family. You think you need you know what God needs to do for your family. The reality is unless God shows us we don't have a clue. &gt;&gt; But waiting on him can reveal the answers. &gt;&gt; And agreeing with him can bring results. &gt;&gt; Lord, I don't even want to tell you what to do. I I'm tired of trying to figure out what needs to be done in each of their lives. I just want what you want for them. Does anybody see the value of discovering the vision of the Lord? &gt;&gt; The desire of the Lord for your family. Oh, folks, this is uh this is this is the hour to catch it. This is the hour. There's no doubt about it. Now, I've got to move on. You see, you're born a peculiar people, a holy nation, a royal priesthood. But what happened? You've let the world shave off your peculiarness until you have become you you you had to have a denomination just like they had. You you had to outshine the Baptists, the Methodists, and now the Assemblies trying to outshine the United. The United Head figured out, didn't he? &gt;&gt; It comes a little closer these days. the church of God out this and oh my and on and on 30 or 40 different denominations like the dog returning to its vomit the same thing he said notice the same thing has been done as it was then let Jezebel the mother of harlots Revelation 17 remember she was called a he said that's an immoral woman a woman always represents the church the church always represented by a woman because Christ one he is coming after he's coming after a bride. And she was this woman, the mother of harlots, an immoral woman. It couldn't have been a man. She claims that she is a mother of all churches. And she is. And we understand what system he's preaching about. And what made her a It's because she committed spiritual fornication. She adopted creeds. Oh my, those rotten denominations out there. &gt;&gt; What about the creeds that we adopt in here? That's right. &gt;&gt; Are they also rotten? &gt;&gt; If they're not on the word, they are. &gt;&gt; She adopted creeds instead of her husband's word. Instead of becoming a rule, true mate to her husband, she took another book of creeds. Oh my, could we ever have a lot of fun with that? Notice now what Delilah did to Samson. She kept wooing him. I watched this wooing over the past 30 years. I understand it now. I didn't understand it then. Paragraph 122. The old path of Pentecost wanted to stay with the word and they adopted pagan ideas through Constantine. As Ahab married Jezebel and brought in idolatry in Israel, so did the church marry into Romanism and bring in idolatry right straight back in the church again. &gt;&gt; Now look out verse 123. Paragraph 123 is a little rough here. Now you've got a little bunch of harlots on the same principles and look what's taking place now. Mother is wooing and again she's going to shave all your rights away from you. God help that. We'll never give it up. &gt;&gt; It's the word. It's the word. &gt;&gt; It's the word or death. &gt;&gt; The council of churches putting themselves together and uniting in fellowship around Rome. Exactly what the Bible said it would do. You could preach that in any church associated with the ministry of brother Brandham around the world. You could quote that and you could preach that, but you couldn't go any farther than that and be likable. &gt;&gt; But the reality is if it's so out there, it can also be so in here. &gt;&gt; I can't perhaps change what's out there, but I have some say, some factor in what goes on in here. Don't you? You do, too. And we must never find ourselves in the comfort of a system. Whether it's a Catholic system or a Pentecostal system or a message system, we should never be comfortable in any kind of system or program other than the program of the mind of God, the program of the Holy Ghost. Anybody with me? &gt;&gt; Good. I'm going to keep reading &gt;&gt; once more. 1963. And now Samson, paragraph 47. And now Samson thinks of the great victories that he had won. Oh, the church has many victories behind us. The bride church, the message church, we have many victories behind us. God has been good to us. No doubt it come to his mind of how that when he was a little boy that God had vindicated him. This one was from today that God had vindicated him. Told his mother how she must do not drink strong drinks to watch what she ate. That she was bringing forth a Nazerite. How she combed his hair. I I wanted to read this one because of the picture. She combed his hair and told him, "Son, listen. Through these locks, it's a covenant with God that your strength will lay in there." How many of you can see a mother? &gt;&gt; She was told to eat only clean food. that she was also to stay away from the things that would defile a Nazerite. Though herself she was not under the vow of a Nazerite, but she was told because of what she was carrying, she should separate herself. And so she is combing the hair of her son and she is reminding him through these locks, you have a covenant with God that your strength will lay in there. Don't never give it away. Amen. &gt;&gt; It reminds me of Sister Green telling us a story standing in the back of the German Center in Tucson. Brother Brham is at the back door greeting a few people that are left in the in the in the hall as the service has been long dismissed. And brother and sister Green's daughter Janet was standing there. And Sister Green said, "Steve, her braid was that thick, going down her back is just a young girl." She said, "You couldn't get your fingers around it." And she said, "Brother Brandham was standing there. Nobody thought anything was on his mind." And all of a sudden, he turned to Janet and he took the ponytail at the top of her head and ran his hand all the way down the ponytail and looked her right in the eye and said, "Don't ever cut that off. Don't ever do anything with that. Just leave it like that. And Sister Green would cry every time because she did. When I hear this, I I think of that warning. Oh my. And it happens even around us. mother's combing the hair and she says you you've got to watch it. It's a covenant with God. Don't never give it away. Don't never give away your secret. Don't never surrender it. Whatever you do, Samson, son, stay with it. You ought to be telling your family. You ought to be telling your children. You ought to be telling those you have influence over. Stay with this word. &gt;&gt; See it for what it is. Stay with this word. You don't want to turn loose of your way out of here. &gt;&gt; And it is not our way out. It reveals our way out. &gt;&gt; You know, Samson didn't personally cut his hair, but he allowed himself to be put in a place, a position where it could be cut. The Nazerite vow required protection of one's consecration and one's commitment. He cries out when he realizes he's awakened by Delilah's scream and he says, "I'll just do what I always have done." And he just shakes himself and the spirit of the Lord was not there. He got the shake right, but the spirit of the Lord was not there because the spirit of the Lord moves in covenant agreement. &gt;&gt; And you you break covenant with God, you can't expect the same results. There are things that we do by by a church tradition. Uh, and that's all right as long as it's not something that disols the word of God. &gt;&gt; But if you're counting on a church tradition to bring the glory, you'll never never be satisfied because you can't do the same thing you've always done expecting different results. &gt;&gt; If you want more, you've got to do a little more. And that doesn't mean strive. &gt;&gt; You see, we have to we have to always come back with this balance because we you tell religious-minded people to do more and what do they do? They work harder. &gt;&gt; That only produces sweat. It only produces perspiration. What I'm talking about is is inspiration. And it doesn't mean working more. It means resting in a promise and surrendering more. And if I understand surrender starts by doing nothing, you just say, "Here I am. Ready, speak, Lord. Your servant heareth." &gt;&gt; What could happen if daddies in this place would get up on a Monday morning and throw their hands up in the air and say, "Speak, Lord. Use me at work today and use me when I come home for my family tonight. Use me &gt;&gt; for your purposes. &gt;&gt; I want us to look at this phrase in Hebrew. He shook himself. That's a Hebrew word, na. And it means to shake out, to sweep or to overflow, to shake off, to shake violently, to shake oneself free of encumbrance, to toss off, to shake loose, to snap off as in the breaking of a rope or a chain. It's the same root word that's used for a lion shaking his prey. It's the same root word that's used for an ox shaking off a yoke of burden. It's the same root word in Hebrew as a warrior shaking off fear or physical shackles. In Samson's mind, he said, "I'll do what I've always done. I will violently shake my body and supernatural strength will be upon me." But it doesn't happen this time. He should have known it wouldn't happen because from the time his mother was combing out his hair, he understood this is a covenant vow &gt;&gt; and the blessing and favor and benefit only come when the covenant is honored. Does anybody understand that we can't do our own thing and expect God to bless us anyhow? He might. I've seen him do it, but he may not. to walk in the favor and the blessing of the Lord is to keep covenant with him. And it's easier than what we have been told because it's by relationship that we keep it. It's just by staying connected. I think brother I think pastor Gabriel sung it right right from the word. It's about abiding in him and his word abiding in you. That doesn't sound like work to me. &gt;&gt; It sounds like surrendering. I I'm I'm going to do what you require, Lord. what you would have me do above my own desire. So it's really not about laboring. It's about surrendering. He wished not. He did not know at first is what this means in Hebrew. It's load. He had no awareness. He had no discernment. He did not perceive any change until he shook himself. Samson had lost all spiritual perception. The Hebrew word that's used here is used in other places for numbness. So it's not that he didn't have any sensation. He actually had what sounds like a numbness. It does come with a tingle. Your foot ever gone to sleep, your arm ever gone to sleep, your hand ever gone. It's it's not like you don't feel anything. There is something there. There is some small sensation there, but certainly not what he expected. A man who was once used to having divine eruptions of the spirit of the Lord now feels very little, if anything at all. That's what makes this such a tragic statement. Because the Lord was departed. Oh Lord, he wishs not that the Lord was departed from him. David Stern's translation, the complete Jewish Bible. But he didn't know that Adoni had left him. It's bad enough that the Lord leaves, but it's worse than that, that the Lord leaves and nobody knows he's gone. Is that is that not a tragedy? &gt;&gt; Why? Because they keep praying and they keep singing and they keep quoting and they don't even know that the Lord has left. When it when it when it uh struck Samson, it didn't strike him only in the flesh. It struck him at the inner core of his being. And this word Lord Adoni, this is the divine name of God. This is Yode Vave. This is the divine name of God that's here. And this was the Almighty. The Almighty had left him. You look at that in the Hebrew, it's it's it's uh sar, which is the same root that's used for for prince. Sar shalom is the prince of peace. But when Sar is used in this context, it means he has removed, he has turned aside, he has withdrawn, he has departed, he has stepped away, he has turned his face from his servant. What a tragedy. God's presence leaves the camp. His favor is withdrawn. his glory moves away. And this word is also used a couple of times in the Old Testament when a covering of protection or a hedge has been removed. It's the same word. It's like it's like what happened to Job when God removed a part of the hedge that was protecting Job. It was as the Lord was turning his face away from Job. But how many of you know he didn't forget his covenant with Job and he didn't forget his covenant with Samson. He didn't forget the promises that he had made to Samson. And he didn't forget that he had chosen Samson to begin the deliverance of the of the children of Israel from the 40 years of bondage and oppression underneath the Philistines. It was God himself who had delivered his own children into the hands of the Philistines. And it was God himself who chose Samson to begin the deliverance. And even though Samson compromised once, twice, three times, and the spirit of the Lord eventually had to leave him standing there defenseless &gt;&gt; because remember he was an ordinary man until the spirit of the Lord fell on him. &gt;&gt; He wasn't uh he wasn't Schwarzenegger. He wasn't Tony Atlas. He wasn't some musclebound godlike man. He was just an ordinary uh you know, brother Brandham loved to call him a until the spirit of the Lord moved on him. So now you take that away from him and he's not going to deliver himself. He's certainly not going to be able to deliver the children of Israel. How tragic this seems. It would be hopeless if it wasn't for covenant. It'd be hopeless. But here's what you need to know if you don't already know. God is not a man that he should lie, &gt;&gt; neither the son of man that he would have need to repent. If God said it, it's settled. &gt;&gt; It's settled. A and I know they like to say, "If God said it, I believe it, and that settles it." That only applies to you personally because if God said it, it's going to happen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; With you or without you, &gt;&gt; God will find somebody. Let me tell you, you know, Mr. Thank you so much. God will find somebody. &gt;&gt; If he said it, it's settled. My word is forever settled in heaven. Look folk, this is really uh you know, I know there's some a little discouraging thing to think about here as a servant of the Lord left alone, but there's a lot of hope in this because God makes a promise. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; he doesn't break it. &gt;&gt; Our our unbelief may delay it. &gt;&gt; Our absence from the center of his will may delay it, but it will not prevent it. If God said it, it is so. There will be sons. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; With father's authority, &gt;&gt; we owe sons. Not just the technon, not just the toddler, but mature. Look, you know, I think most of us feel like we are mature, but I got a camera on you. And I can sit in my office and watch how you behave when you come in here, you know, and I see people, not today, but sometimes I see people fussing and fuming over a seat, throwing things. I didn't know you wanted to be here that bad because you show up sometime and you're not here. But I see it. Brother Gley and I got accused of being communist one time because we had a camera by precious sister big brothers watching you. So be careful how you think you're mature because mature people don't have to have the same seat every time. And mature people sometimes have to sit by stinky people, but they don't get all out of shape. And you may not want to sit by someone with body order, but maybe they don't want to sit by you with that cheap perfume you wear. It's so full of chemicals it'll give anybody a headache. &gt;&gt; We We That's not maturity. Maturity says, "I don't even have to have a chair. Just get me in the presence. &gt;&gt; Just let me get under the the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I'll sit on my fist and lean back on my thumb if that's what I have to do. But I've got to be in the presence of the Lord. We're not there yet. We're not desperate enough yet. &gt;&gt; And it's going to require some of that desperation to move us into that place of maturity &gt;&gt; where all that matters is getting him, &gt;&gt; holding on to him and not letting him go. I'll be honest with you, he doesn't want to go. Right. He doesn't want to leave. He doesn't want to. But like uh like so many other situations, he wants to be wanted. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? The God of creation wants to be wanted. &gt;&gt; It's something we don't understand about Almighty God. uh we we can see it in Adam, but we can't necessarily see it in his creator. But you've got to understand the whole reason why there was an Adam. &gt;&gt; It's because God wanted to be wanted. &gt;&gt; He wanted to be wanted. He wanted to be worshiped, but not by robots &gt;&gt; without a will. Right? &gt;&gt; He wanted to be worshiped by those who had a will and who chose to worship him &gt;&gt; because they loved him above all. Anybody here? &gt;&gt; So, we're in this place where we've, you know, and I say we because I don't think it's fair to always say they, they. And when I say we, you know whether or not you're guilty. I know whether or not I'm guilty. But it's just better to say we, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Because some of us we are guilty. But this is where we are in the message pursuming. You see, Samson was just beginning to realize that that divine covering had lifted from him. And that's exactly where the church world, this is what brother Brandon was preaching in the 50s and 60s. He said, "The church world is in the position where Samson was." Now, I can say that today. I can preach it, brother. Believe me. I can preach that because I believe that if it was if the church was in Samson's broken condition without the spirit of God in the 50s, it's more so today than it ever was. &gt;&gt; But again, that's just pointing fingers out there. What I'd like to say today is the sad shame is that many of us who know better and who have better and who claim better, I think we throw around the word the phrase that we have the perfect word. We we have the perfection. Someone told me this week that there are just many things we don't need anymore, including the Old Testament, because we have the perfect word. You know the symptoms of having the perfect word. I know it's I know symptoms is being used here a little odd but I like to say instead of the fruit the symptoms that somebody has the perfect word is is maturity &gt;&gt; I it it's not um argumentativeness &gt;&gt; or or or obstinate &gt;&gt; or stubborn will &gt;&gt; or narcissistic tendency The church is full of narcissists. The pull pit, too. We need a shaking. And in order to shake and get the right results, we've got to get in covenant. Is that right? &gt;&gt; I know we're moving slow. It's good for us. So good for us. In 134 of the message pursuming, he said, "Need we more." We need more holiness. That's not more rules. &gt;&gt; It's not more legislated holiness. &gt;&gt; It's more overflowing holiness. &gt;&gt; You see, holiness is a byproduct. It's a fruit of being occupied, &gt;&gt; chosen, set apart by that which is holy. All bushes were the same until that day that God Almighty crawled in that bush. That bush wasn't holy before. That bush wasn't different before. But you put the holiness of Almighty God on a frog and he becomes a holy frog. It doesn't matter what it is. If you put the holiness of God on it and in it, it becomes holy. That's what makes you holy. It's not your uniform. &gt;&gt; It's not your adherence to the rule. &gt;&gt; It's the fact that holiness has come to live, to dwell, to abide in you. And I'm with brother Brand. I'm here 100%. We need more holiness. We need more surrender. We need more laying down of our will so that the holy fire can come. We need to be cleaned up. Uh he got it kind of personal here. I hear somebody helping me back there. That's good. &gt;&gt; Our churches. &gt;&gt; Let's say it that way today. Our churches need more holiness. not not more Revlon and Max Factor, but they need more holiness because those things that we have called holiness, they do they do they are the fruit. They are the testimony. They are the outward amen to what God is doing on the inside. &gt;&gt; And when you find yourself going back to pick up the things that you once laid down in his name, it's simply because the fire is lifting. I I don't I have no problem saying that you can sit down and put before your eyes something you used to couldn't put before your eyes. It's a testimony that the fire is lifting &gt;&gt; and only you can have it back, get it back, call it back, prepare to have it back. It's only us. &gt;&gt; He said Samson went down there and lived with this prostitute and then he she finally told him to do this and I finally got by with it and I think it'll be all right. I presume he's with me. Woo. Just because he's on the front stoop knocking on the door don't mean he lives in your house. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, uh, I I presume he's with me. But when he got up, this came out in the Friday text, but when he got up and shook himself, he found out the power was gone. That his power was gone. He said, 'I think today, brother, when we look around upon our churches, the way they're going, it's time to our churches &gt;&gt; shake ourselves. I believe it. I believe it. I believe it. Shake ourselves. That's right. I think today, brethren, when we look around, it's time to shake oursel. Something's wrong. We're presuming that we're running all right. We're presuming that we're doing fine. Awakening Jesus 183. I think of Samson. He found a man with plenty of strength to God. Plenty of strength. And Samson dedicated his strength to God, but he wouldn't give his heart. He gave that to Delilah. Ouch. Oh my. It's like young people who come and say, "Pastor, what do you think about maybe I have a relationship with so and so?" When the reality is you've already given your heart away. Why do you need any help now? Why do you even care what anybody else thinks when you give your heart away, brother, sister? You're you're pushing an agenda. You ought to hold on to your heart until you know what is the mind of God. Let me look around and find the sleepers. Sometimes I get sometimes people text me pictures. Interesting, isn't it? I have a whole collection on my phone. There's nothing like encouraging a pastor by sending a text of asleep. I expect it. Don't disappoint me. I'm not a big church age book quarter, but I like this. Dr. Vale got it right this time. He said, "God used an Abraham. He lied. He used a Moses. He rebelled. &gt;&gt; A Jonah, he disobeyed. &gt;&gt; A Samson, he sinned. A David, he murdered. &gt;&gt; He also used a Joshua and a Joseph. And those with severe Blemishes far outnumbered those whose histories seem to be perfect. All were all were and are &gt;&gt; woo. &gt;&gt; Hey, we Samsons have a chance &gt;&gt; because the covenant is not broken. That's right. &gt;&gt; He'll use us. He allows us to be broken so that he can use us. Seport I'm going to read a lot. Sorry. It's just today. It just happened to be today. Paragraph 79 just once more. Samson knew one. And I won't read them all. I've got a couple of more sermons in this little series and I won't ever read them all. It's 100 pages. 100 pages of quotations where brother Brandham is speaking about Samson. I find that he had more to say about the story of Samson than perhaps any other story in the Bible. There there's something. It's like in theology when you when you look at the first mention and the last mention and the and you look at the uh frequency of mention and it kind of gives you this idea that there was something in this story that we need to hold on to even in 2026. There's something applicable to us in this hour. He said Samson knew one thing and I wonder if the church realizes it today. He knew that his oh his backslidden condition couldn't &gt;&gt; I need brother Daniel today could couldn't meet the challenge of the man I'll just do brother Daniel I need it every now and Again, the backsliding condition couldn't meet the challenge of the hour. And I know today that the backsliding condition of the church can't meet the challenge of the hour. And it's going to be worse. He said, "The Bible said, "As Janice and Jambage with Moses, so will they. Men of reprobate mind concerning the faith, they can almost impersonate it." Exactly. I find that around the message of the hour, they've been so afraid of impersonators &gt;&gt; and imitators that they've labeled anybody with anything, any uncction, any gift, any life. They must be a Janice and a Jambre. I wouldn't want us to become that skeptical. Moses went down with his command from God with a stick in his hand. And God said, "Do the sign before them. And if they won't listen to that, do this sign before them. If they won't listen to that, then I'll be with you. I'll take care of the rest of it." &gt;&gt; That's where we are. God's taking care of the rest of it. &gt;&gt; Well, Moses went down with his first sign. And as soon as he performed his first sign, there were impersonators everywhere doing the same thing. But Moses never fussed about it. He just stood still. For he knew that it was God that sent him. We're going to have that repeat again in the last days. And our backsliden state, listen folks, and our backsliden state now will not meet the challenge of the hour. Right. &gt;&gt; 2025 was a challenge, but 2026 is also it's another challenge because as we get closer, the challenge will morph. It will multiply. It will change. And there has to be a bride that can keep up. The word is the same. The word is the same. It doesn't change. But there are things that we have to keep up with as the challenge changes to always be able to meet the challenge of the spirit of the hour, the spirit of the age. We've got to be not stagnant. We've got to be free flowing. We've got to be free. We have to have liberty. There must be liberty. Somebody say liberty. There must be liberty &gt;&gt; to meet the challenge of the hour. He said, "There's more Pentecostals in the world today than there ever was more Pentecostal believers." That's right. And I used this at the beginning of this series, but I couldn't let today go by without using it again. Paragraph 125 of Just Once More Lord Shreport. Same message. Listen. Destroy &gt;&gt; your enemy before you. He'll do it. He said, "Bring back the oldfashioned meetings and the thing and oh, leave Delilah alone. Leave the world alone." The thing that woos you off into little things that you shouldn't and little things troubles comes up in the church and you won't stand correction because you don't have to. You can drop off to another church and things like that. In the early days when a man didn't cope up with the word of God. Oh, I don't like to read that. Somebody said because it brings fear. If it's the fear of the Lord, bring it on because we need some fear of the Lord. The Pentecostal and charismatic church has certainly taken the fear of the Lord out of the people. But you must not be those who lose their reverential fear and awe of Almighty God. And look at what brother Brandham says. He's almost cursing here. If you listen to our preachers, he said, "Bring us back to Pentecost." One of my famous, infamous sermons in the 90s was uh Pentecost is not a swear word &gt;&gt; because they just they just had a way of saying Pentecost. We were Pentecostals like it was cancer. Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. I'm standing strong today because the experience that I had back then &gt;&gt; was genuine. &gt;&gt; Didn't you need a message? I did. Some don't. I did. Didn't you need a pro? I did need a prophet. I needed help. But I had an experience with God. And Jesus says it best. When he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he'll lead you. &gt;&gt; He'll guide you. He'll direct you to what? All truth. He's still doing that. And then Judges 16:21, let me see what time it is. Oh yes, it's early. But the Philistines took him and put out his eyes and brought him down to Gaza and bound him with feathers of brass. And he did grind in the prison house. Somebody say, "Poor Samson." Say it again. &gt;&gt; Poor Samson. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Poor us." &gt;&gt; Poor me. Because if we're not careful, the same devil, the same enemy, the same the same agenda &gt;&gt; that that took Samson's sight would take gladly take the sight of the end time church. &gt;&gt; If the enemy could blind you to the reality of the hour you're living in, he would do it without hesitation. If he could convince you that the spirit of God is no longer revealing himself to individuals, he would do it in an instant. If the devil could somehow convince you that the Holy Ghost and the and the administration of the gifts of the spirit was not for today, he if he could convince you of that, he would do it in a heartbeat &gt;&gt; because he knows that if we take the spirit away from the truth, &gt;&gt; we have a halfbaked cake &gt;&gt; because Jesus said, "They who worship me, there's coming a tower that those who worship me must worship me with both sides of the take &gt;&gt; spirit &gt;&gt; and truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But here's my hope. We're moving into hope. It's verse 22. How be it, can you read it all together just like sweet little church folks? How be it the hair &gt;&gt; hallelujah? Hallelujah. You know why I got up this morning? Because the hair begins to grow again. &gt;&gt; Because the hopelessness of the old is leaving me &gt;&gt; and the hope of the new is returning. Because we know by the law of creation in most cases look around in not all cases but in most cases you shave it off. Let me hear you. &gt;&gt; It grows back. It's growing back. It's coming back. Why? Because God is a covenant keeper. &gt;&gt; He's not just a covenant maker. He's a covenant keeper. &gt;&gt; Hair is growing back. Glory be to God. It began to grow. Somebody say began to grow again. &gt;&gt; Oh, this is not a mistake. This this is careful wording. He doesn't have seven locks. hanging down his back. But he's got some stubble coming. That's the only thing that's likable about shaving hair is because that that's a when it gets real short like like this. This is short hair, folks, for you that don't know. This is short hair. And when it you you can do you catch yourself. I'm weird. I catch myself, oh yeah, that feels nice when it's short like that. I was getting my haircut the other day and there was a woman's a relative of the girl who cuts my hair was sitting there. She's just come through horrible rounds of chemotherapy and her hair is growing back and it's only about that long, but it is full and it is thick. And she said, "Aren't you a pastor?" And I said, "Yes." She said, "I thought I remembered you. I thought I remembered that you were." And she said, "Look what the Lord has done." She said, "In the throws of that losing my hair," she said, "I didn't want I didn't have strength to hold my head up, but she said, "I'm getting my strength back. I'm getting my hair back." And Lord, to me it was just, you know, barely fuzz. But to her, after not having any, she looked in the mirror and and it was like long beautiful locks to her. Do you understand the concept? &gt;&gt; So it it's not that Samson woke up one morning and had seven braids hanging down his back. It's that he woke up one morning and his hair on his head had began to grow again. I wish that we were at seven lock stage. I wish we were back to where we had full capacity, power, and authority. But the reality is after this long battle, we are just now beginning to wake up to the reality that God is a covenant keeping God. He hasn't thrown his little bride away. He hasn't forgot his promise to this end time overcoming army of people. We have laid our head in Delilah's lap. And we have become powerless. But the God of covenant said, "Come back. Don't compare yourself with what other message churches are doing. You come back and find my will for where I put you and your hair will begin to grow again. This is uh it's Hebrew Vel ro which is head like the head of the year leta and and it's but the hair of his head began to grow again. The word vel appears in this verse and it's got a lot of meaning. He has been imprisoned. His eyes poked out and he is turning out the grain like a o ax, a beast, a burden. Can you imagine this mighty warrior? This champion is now tethered to a grinding stone and he's making his circles like the like the like the bear in the shuffle. He's making his circles like Johnny Crow. Brother Brandham talked about Johnny Crow with a string on his foot. Yes. And Samson just going around and around and around bald-headed, blinded, embarrassed. Brother Bram said, "What a pity. What a shame. What an embarrassment." But his hair, some little kid had gone by to watch him. This great champion of the enemy nation of Israel, some little boy had gone by and struck up a friendship with him and and and told him one day said, "Hey, hey, you big uh brute, your hair is beginning to grow again." Oh, is it? Yes, it is. And it gave him hope. It gave him energy. It gave him strength. It gave him something to keep pushing. I'm going to keep grinding here and pushing here while it grows. This is not a casual began to grow. This is a very purposeful choice of words in Hebrew. This word means to begin again, to restart, to renew, to reinitiate, to resume after an interruption and to enter into a new phase. Oh, hallelujah. This is not a casual began. You see, the moment God begins again, even while the enemy thinks the story is finished, God was already initiating renewal even before Samson renewed his covenant. The outward sign was growing while the inward surrender was forming. Hello, &gt;&gt; did you hear that? &gt;&gt; The outward sign was growing while the inward surrender was forming. And the reason why this matters, the text does not say his hair grew, his hair returned, his strength was back to normal. It all came rushing back. Specifically, the scripture says his hair began. Say with me, began to grow again. All it takes is renewing the covenant. All it takes is saying, "Lord, won't you help me again one more time? won't you pass by and help me get back to where I once was. Restoration started before deliverance. Renewal began before victory. Consecration returned before power. This is a turning point word. &gt;&gt; His hair began to grow again. &gt;&gt; I want you to look at your neighbor. I mean it. Even if they have bad breath, I want you to look at your neighbor and say, "It's time for a comeback." And now do it again. Say it again. Mean it. Say it like you mean it this time. It's time &gt;&gt; for a comeback. This uh season didn't catch God by surprise. That's right. &gt;&gt; For quite some time, it looked as if Samson would just rot. in some Philistine jail. But God still has the power in reserve for those who are willing to be part of a comeback. Samson's eyes were gone. His freedom was gone. His position was gone. His reputation was gone. But his hair began to grow again. God had already begun something again. The Philistines thought the story was over. Hallelujah. The defactors and critics of this message and those who are uh dutifully with great determination picking the the life of brother Brandham apart bone by bone by bone as if that had anything to do with the truth. You ought heard what he said. He said, "Don't pay any attention to me. &gt;&gt; Don't look at the messenger." This is what he said. You should have listened. Don't look at the messenger. I make thousands of mistakes every day. That was a mistake to say that. That's an exaggeration. Hello. &gt;&gt; Nobody makes thousands of mistakes every day. But brother Bham said, I make thousands of mistakes every day. That was a mistake. So that proved the point right there. Don't look at me. He said, "You look to the message &gt;&gt; because the message is not the doctrine of William Brandom. &gt;&gt; The message is the revelation of Jesus Christ." And if you want don't know where it's found, it's not only found in Revelation chapter 10. It's found in Genesis to Revelation &gt;&gt; from one amen to the last. Amen. All of it is a revelation is the revelation of Jesus Christ. And the messenger becomes more irrelevant &gt;&gt; as the message becomes more real. &gt;&gt; Oh, I hear you. I already hear you. I hear them. They all stream. They'll have something to preach Wednesday night. I'm good for something. I'm giving him fodder to use. You shouldn't say that he blessed God. He means more to me today than he ever did. More to me today than the first tape I ever heard. You think that's the goal, but that's not the goal. &gt;&gt; You think that gives you a trophy in the Hall of Faith, but it gives you no such thing because you didn't hear what John the Baptist said. If he's still meaning more and more and the emphasis is becoming more and more on the messenger, you're missing what he said. It's the message that must become more and more real to us as the days go by because it's not the revelation of a messenger. It's the revelation of Jesus Christ. What did he say? I must You think that offends brother Brandham if he should hear it? Oh, he says, "Get them, boys. Tell them. Tell them just like it is." Cuz until they can see Jesus, all they'll see is mistakes. &gt;&gt; That's right. But if you one time, if you one time stare into the eyes of perfection, &gt;&gt; if you ever see the beauty of the Lord, you'll never be satisfied with a picture of a cloud &gt;&gt; or the picture of a pillar of fire. Oh, it's these are beautiful things. Don't don't misunderstand. But that's not the goal. The goal is to get him in. You and him and and he and you. It's huge. It's close because her hair, his hair, I say her, the church, there's little bride remnant. It's not It's Listen, listen. I I got some bad news for you. I need to go ahead and get it out. Let's see. Do I have time? I do. Everybody who goes to a spoken word tabernacle or a word of life tabernacle or a end time message of the hour tabernacle, everyone who goes to a church is identified with the ministry of William Brandham, they won't all make it. That's right, brother. because he said every church. Oh, in the 90s I didn't believe it about this church, but in the 2020s I'm sure. No, I didn't fall. I'm going to be okay. I'm all right. Just a little emotional. I didn't believe it in the beginning because I I tell you, all I could see was him moving and changing people's lives. You could have never convinced me in those days that there was a makeeliever among us and certainly not an unbeliever. But as the years go by and I see so many attracted to different things, I realize that in every church he was absolutely right. Oh, we pastors don't maybe we still don't want to think about it, but it's the reality &gt;&gt; because you can sit week after week after week and hear the same truth and not be born again and not be changed by it and not grow with it and not recognize that we are now a generation past the rapture. He told us way back when that the rapture was overdue. If you think the rapture was overdue in ' 64, what do you think it is today? &gt;&gt; It's another generation past due. I don't think the word I don't think we're waiting on the word to get perfect. I think the word was perfect before the messenger. &gt;&gt; The church doctrine wasn't, but the word was. &gt;&gt; We didn't understand it all, but it was perfect. Never has been anything but. Now we're a whole generation removed and we're we're having to admit through uh clenched teeth that we're still here. We're still here. There's been no rapture. We're way past 77 and there's still not enough perfect love to bring the bridegroom back. But the hair is growing. You hear me? &gt;&gt; God's keeping his promise. Be careful what you look at. Be careful what you make your focus. Don't let it be your pastor. God will let him stumble. Keep your eye on him. Keep your eye on Jesus. Keep your Oh, folks, he's all together lovely. Let's see. 95 2005 2015 2025 is that 30 years February the 19th of of 2025 was 30 years ago. So this this was a word of the Lord that came in February the 19th of 1990. 30 years ago God spoke in the house and said, "My children, listen. this night. Knowest thou not the hour? How is it, my children, that many walk and know not the hour that they walk in? Yay, the Lord thy God would say, the darkest hour is upon thee. The slippery pit has been dug before you, says the Lord. And the enemy, your adversary, the adversary of your soul, has come to steal you away. But I, the Lord, would say unto thee, my church, I will send my angel, saith the Lord, he will guide you around the edges of the treacherous pit. He will not suffer you to fall in the trap that Satan has laid for you, says the Lord. But he will put his arm under you and lift you, and if need be, he will carry you upon his shoulders across until you've reached the other side of safety. Oh my children, I would that you were hot or cold or lukewarm I will spew out of my mouth. Be not lazy. Do not be adjusted to this world, but cry after me. And even as the little deer panteth after the water, I desire that your inner man would cry and pant and long after me. For I have ways that you know not of. And I have things that you know not of. And I have meat for you to eat that you know not of. and spiritual drink. I the Lord would say, recognize this hour and recognize that I have called you to stand in this hour and watch and pray. Be alert and awake. Listen, for the enemy is upon thee, and the Philistines are upon thee, says the Lord. But oh, if you will refrain and refuse to lay your head in the lap of a Jezebel, I will bring you forth. He who does not compromise. I will bring you forth from the trap of Delilah, says God. I will cause your hair to grow back, says the Lord. And what I have done before I will do again, &gt;&gt; says the Lord, for I am not a man that I should change, neither that I would repent, but I am forever more the same. Shake thyself, oh Samson. Shake thyself, oh Samson, for I will cause your hair to grow again. Thus saith the Lord. 30 years ago, you couldn't possibly believe that that's still on the horizon. Oh yes, it's right on the horizon. It's so close we can almost smell it if we weren't sleeping. And then 23, verse 23, I'm I'm nearly done. You got all evening to check the scores and do everything you need to do before work on Monday. Then the Lord of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto day gone their God and to rejoice for they said, "Our God hath delivered." Listen, I'm telling you what you want to get God stirred. &gt;&gt; Just start mocking like this. They didn't know what they were doing. H our God, little G, part fish. I think if I'm going to give something my attention, it's going to be a little higher up the chain than a fish. God had delivered. Our God had delivered Samson, our enemy, into our hand. And when the people saw him, they praised their God, for they said, "Oh, our God hath delivered into our hands our enemy and the destroyer of our country which slew many of us." And it came to pass while their hearts when their hearts were merry that they said, "Call for Samson uh that he may make a sport." For they said him. They set him between the pillars. Bad move. Bad bad bad move. Be careful what you mock. &gt;&gt; And so in in in uh one of my favorite messages, the rejected king, Shiakaco, Ohio, you should hear it. It doesn't sound like the order of message churches today. You should hear it. Screaming. People screaming. Oh little lambs, I'm coming after you. He said in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. In paragraph 82, oh yes, they wanted this king. And when they got the king, then the enemy began to put the eyes of the people out. And then they couldn't see where they were going. That's the problem. Nobody can see where they're going. right into denominational bondage. And they love this quote where brother Brandham said, "There'll never be a denomination formed or built around this." They love it. They just don't know how to define this. This is the revelation of Jesus Christ. You'll never be able to build a denomination around the revelation of Jesus Christ. But you can build it around books and tapes and stories and testimonies and signs and wonders and icons. Because if you're one of those who's still running around the stop sign but paying no attention to what the voice of the sign is, this is so common. It happened all through church history. God sends a sign and people get excited about the sign and they're jumping up and down and screaming about the sign and they don't hear the voice because the prophet said, "Every time God sends a sign, there's a voice that follows that sign." And it was the voice. And then you've got the Jeffersonville cult who uh all they talk about is the voice. They're so fascinated with the voice that they have to say that it's all thus sayeth the Lord. And this is contrary to reality because you can't preach two sides of the same truth and it both be thus sayeth the Lord. It never was intended to be that way. I heard them in the weekly dispatch. You know, we get this weekly letter from headquarters still. I have to read it to keep up with the silliness of what they say. It makes me want to puke. It gets vile and vile as the weeks go by. It's everything I said it would be about 35 years ago. It's now upon us. And it's very serious business because if you can't discern between the servant and the god who got in the servant and they use this story of Moses just recently and they forgot something big in the life of Moses. When you compare brother Brandham to Moses, you better be careful not to forget that Moses didn't get to go in &gt;&gt; because he disobeyed. And we can we can dress it up and say he made a mistake. But he disobeyed because prophets are not perfect. They don't like to say it, but he said it. Brother Bren said it himself. They're not perfect. He said, "You'll see. They're not perfect, but the word, the word is perfect. The absolute is perfect." &gt;&gt; Do you agree? &gt;&gt; You must. You're still here. The first thing the devil does when he can get a servant of God, he blinds him to the fact that he's lost. He said that's the first thing uh the enemy done. When they got Samson, another judge, they put his eyes out where he couldn't see where he was going. As soon as the enemy of the Philistines came in upon Israel, they put their right eye out so they couldn't see good where they were going. When the enemy comes into a church, he puts their eyes out to the real facts that the Holy Spirit is the one who rules and governs the church. All discipline is brought. Want to try it again? All discipline is brought. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Amen. Oh, I wish I could say the words that would make it go home to the right place. see that it would never leave that it would cinch in there. God gave the Holy Spirit, not a pope, not a potentate, not the son of a prophet. God gave the Holy Spirit to rule and govern the church. &gt;&gt; Third Exodus, God deals with an individual, not with groups, with individuals. Samson dropping way down. Samson gave him great power. God gave him great power, but he sold it out to a woman and was blinded. New York, New York. I've got to get this one in. So why should we have to stand in the presence of some heathen god and take a defeat? We stand again like Samson, spiritually stripped, morally broken our churches. What has happened? They used to be honorable men and women and today it's terrible. Now let's just look a few minutes at some thoughts that passed up upon us upon this. So there stood Samson, pardon me. Here he is again today again stripped morally, spiritually. And it's also a symbol of a fallen nation. But we're speaking of the church because Samson was God's servant supposed to be. And the church is supposed to be God's servant on the and let me say the message church is supposed to be God's servant. in the earth. Many great warriors standing there sober up for a moment as the liquors run off their probably their armors and breastplates their arms around their pretty jeweled queens and they look out upon their many of them looking at this site a little boy holding this big bulk of a man and no eyeballs in his sockets. They'd been burned out. That's what the enemy does. The first thing when he gets a hold of you, he does like he did to Samson. You shut your eyes off from the light of the gospel. Now he cannot see. His eyes are gone. Long has the church lost its spiritual sight that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. And every promise is true. Still here. &gt;&gt; And as they stand there now, no eyes are ridiculous sight, a disgrace among standing beneath the fish god, a captive of the very nation that God raised him up to destroy. Now I'm going to come home just a minute and here is our Pentecostal people 50 years ago left that muk of denomination. And I'm going to just bring it right up to the day. I've been known to do that a time or two. And here we are in the message church. Left our denominational systems 50 years ago when we heard God's servant call it. Right here we stand today. Dozens of organizations perusia. Seven thunders. Seventh seal open. Seventh seal closed. Seventh seal closed but open but not revealed. Seven thunders are the seven mysteries. No, wait a minute. There are seven seals on the back side of the book. No. Went by me in an unknown tongue. I could not make it out. Some of you are lost. These are the statements that build camps, &gt;&gt; break fellowship, and they boast. We understand it all. Perfect message, perfect word. We understand it all. No, you don't. You don't. You understand the quote you've chosen to stand on, but you don't understand it all. It wasn't meant for for us to understand it all just yet. We have to get our focus right. Amen. &gt;&gt; The very thing that God listen the very thing that God called us out to defeat it has defeated us. What do you think that is? A denominational spirit. &gt;&gt; If one goes to this denomination has a meeting, rest of them won't don't want to cooperate. Just now and then you can't find one. The denomination has always been a curse in the sight of God. It never was. God never did. That never was his plan. Can anybody say amen? &gt;&gt; And here's what I wrote. Could it also be said that even in our own ranks, we have been weakened by allowing the enemy to talk us out of our genuine experience with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Emotion in worship banned. Tongues banned. Love gifts of the spirit band. It's like a big red X five-fold proon. Do I see mad? I'm not mad. Not at all. Cuz I see hair growing again. I'm just determined to call it like I see it. It almost cost me my life one time. Maybe it will this time and it'll all be over. I'm looking for Jesus. I'm looking for him. I got to get in one more. You said that before. Good. I'll say it again. Uh, love faith cometh by here. I didn't come for quotes. Sorry. So sorry. That's what we have today. How little Samson I can imagine seeing little Samson with his seven little locks hanging down. Oh, some people picture him like he had the door show like he had door shoulders like the doors back there. Great big brute of a man. Paragraph 55. Oh brother, it's not the size of the dog in the fight. It's the size of the fight that's in the dog. &gt;&gt; Anybody got a fight in you? 58 and 57, excuse me. Let me see a little old cowardly church that's afraid to trust God or a family and let the spirit of God strike that family or that individual or that church. It doesn't take a whole church. Doesn't even take a whole family. If just one individual would stand, surrendered and let the Holy Ghost strike you, &gt;&gt; occupy you, take charge of you, watch what takes place, brother. I'm telling you, the skeptics fly like roaches in the summertime &gt;&gt; when you begin to turn the light on. Oh, one more time. God's going to vindicate his word. &gt;&gt; He's not going to vindicate William Brandom. He's going to vindicate his word one more time. &gt;&gt; And it's going to be operating in a many membered little bride. Remnant bride. Somebody say remnant bride. &gt;&gt; Because you may think you're a bride and not be bride. It's not a game here. It's a real deal. &gt;&gt; Cut out of the same cloth. Some used, some discarded. Somebody said, "I don't know which one I want to be." Keep following. You'll you'll decide. You'll see it clearly who you want to be. He said, "Uh, I can hear his mother say, Samson, darling. You're just an ordinary boy now, but you're a Nazerite to the Lord. The Lord before the foundation of the world has ordained you for this ministry. What is it, mama dear? You're to let them seven locks grow." And as long as God sees those seven locks, he sees his promise. They shaved them off one time, but they growed back. When old Samson stood there and seen them, he knowed God could look down and see his promise. He was under obligation to his word. Somebody say, "God is under obligation &gt;&gt; to his word. not to our perceptions, our interpretations, our private understandings, but he is obligated to the wholeness of his word. I want to show you your role, but I don't I can't do it today. There's no time. But I want to show you your role. There is a remnant within a bride. There was a bride within a church. There is a remnant among those who identify themselves as bride and their responsibility in the end time must be clear. It is your responsibility to help Samson. Once upon a time, Samson was a type of a backslid denominational church system. But we're past that now. And Samson now stands as a spiritual type of a people who were called out by a word, but have grown cold, backslid, lukewarm, who have divided themselves over petty issues and formed a multitude of denominational systems. And still they're under covenant. because they were chosen from the foundation of the world to overcome. It's not their responsibility to make themselves overcome. It's God's responsibility. If he called you an overcomer, it's his responsibility to place within us what we need. &gt;&gt; And he's faithful. Somebody say with me, he's faithful. We can't throw the baby out with the bathwater. Doesn't matter how they've disappointed us. Doesn't matter how we have watched things turn. It doesn't matter. We cannot be bitter. And we cannot forget them, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because God didn't. God hasn't. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God never will. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I want you to see with me as we close, uh, and I'll bring it a little closer in the next few services. I want you to see Samson powerless. And this time, I want you to see her, see Samson representing a people who heard a truth and who left so much behind. I know I'm a little emotional. It has been easy for some to find its flaws and walk away. But there's nowhere to go. Lord, where would we go? &gt;&gt; I've been out there. Let me just a moment. Back to the assemblies, back to the church of God, back to the Jesus name. No, nothing there, knee skirts and high heel shoes and but they got long sleeves. the UPC. They're not going to show their elbows, but they'll show their knees and they'll stand on them stilts and twist around on the platforms. And I couldn't go there. There's no once this word has struck your heart, there would be nowhere else to land. So see Samson representing now a people who who denominated themselves because they got tired of waiting on the promise. And so they had to build some structures to keep things going. And in order to do that they had to attach themselves to things other than the word. And they had to fill their churches with icons and pictures and histories and the God of yesterday. But God didn't change his covenant with Samson. God allowed the enemy to come in, shave Samson's hair, took his spirit away from him, and left him blind and going in circles. But God had a plan. He had a remnant. He had a little boy who didn't know what Samson knew. He didn't know the role. And this little boy prophetically speaks of a remnant people who may not know all that they want to know and may not know all that they will eventually come to know by revelation, but they know one thing. They know how to help Samson get his arms around the pillars. His enemy put him between the pillars, but he's blind and he needed help getting his arms around the pillars. Did you know they have uncovered not too long ago, they've uncovered some of these temples in what would have been called Felistia or or or in the Gaza. And the pillars, these temples were built around two wooden pillars but with solid metal sockets 6 feet apart and and that's all the main the whole building built around. Brother Brandham calls it a upside down mushroom. I don't know exactly what that means but he says it more than once. He said they sort of built their temple and it looked like an upside down mushroom and they've just recently found them and they found the sockets of the pillars in more than one uh ruins of temples to Deegon and they were six feet apart. So we know uh through through archaeology we know that that was the structure of these particular places of uh entertainment but dedicated to the worship of a false god. six feet apart and massive pillars. So, it took a pretty pretty big stretch. Kind of when I was a boy, I had a stretch Armstrong. You could just stretch their arms forever. Some of you don't even know what that is. It took something took somebody's because this isn't one one one boy. It is in the story, but it's a type. For me, it is. And and the whole purpose of that remnant was to help the bride church Samson now position himself, get in position for the final glory. The sad thing is Samson lost his reputation. He died in the process but with greater glory. I don't want to put carnal thoughts in your mind. This isn't some kind of suicide. This is a very spiritual thing. I'm going to close as the musicians are coming by saying the remnant matters. Those who have an ear to hear matter. It doesn't matter whether you're embraced, celebrated, recognized, beloved by the others. What matters is you keep your focus on Jesus &gt;&gt; and his word and his life and be available in an hour when somebody needs to know where the pillars are. &gt;&gt; The pillars are what held the whole thing up. And somebody's going to need to know where the pillars are. So you're going to have to stay with the word. I'm going to have to stay with the word because while the hair is growing out, God is getting ready to restore power to a little bride because the rapture is a reality. I believe it. &gt;&gt; I believe it. But there's going to require some positioning and that is going to demand that our eyes are in the right place and our lives are built on the right place and that we carry the right spirit &gt;&gt; and the right attitude toward our enemies and our fellow brethren. Because perfect love is going to be the key that brings Samson and the little boy back together. It is. It's going to be love. It's going to require love. And that means you and I have to be ready. We have to be ready for whatever God has. Let's stand. We don't have time to worry about our someone sitting in our seat. We've got to lay it all down. Lord, let our lives be laid down today. May our only agenda be yours. There's a world that's dying while we're in here trying to get it right. May we carry this great light that you have placed within your people. May we carry it outside the four walls of this building and be an inspiration to those who are groping in the darkness. We have described the condition of the church that's supposed to be alive. But but the the condition of the world around us is dark. They're depending. They're looking. They're hoping for something. We are going to be required to provide what is needed. That means it has to be hanging on the walls. It's got to be here. It's got to be with us and in us because they're going to come. And they're going to come because we've shined the light. And they're going to need deliverance. And they're going to need help. And they're going to need hope. Lord Jesus, wake us up in this hour and help us to recognize that the best is yet to come. We get tired and weary in mind and body, but Lord, we thank you for the hope and we thank you for the reviving of our inner man. Your word quickens us and challenges us. We've seen enough of the realm of flesh and we long we long to draw breath from the realm of spirit. Yours life. Your life. Oh Jesus, we reach up. Would you just reach your hand up toward him? Lord, fill me. Fill me with your life. Fill me with your life. Fill me with your life. You're a covenantkeeping God. Even when we drop the baton, you're a covenant keeping God. &gt;&gt; Even when we lay our head in the lap of that, you're a covenantkeeping God. So, we're here to celebrate today, Lord, that you cannot change your word and what you've promised, you will bring to pass. &gt;&gt; And we get to be a tiny little part, oh Lord, just a tiny little part of what you're doing. &gt;&gt; Use our youth, use our elderly, use all the in between. Use us in the kingdom of our God. I wonder would you just any of you just want to come for a moment? We're doing a little different right now and you just want to come and and stand with me in the front and we we just want to say Lord if you can use anyone you can use me. I'm here today Lord making myself available again. I may not understand it all but I surrender and I say Lord you you make it clear I'll do it. You you make it plain. I'll obey. You show me the way, I'll walk in it, Lord. I I don't want uh stagnant life. I I don't want death. I want uh all that you have made available and provided for me by the word and the spirit. Revive us, &gt;&gt; resuscitate us, renew us this day. Let us be rooted and grounded in the center of your word and be movable and bendable and pliable as the spirit of God would breathe over us and move over us even in this hour. Uh may we remember the word of the Lord 30 years ago. And may we may we uh hear the voice that says, "Samson, the enemy is upon you. Wake up. Wake up. This isn't the hour to be asleep spiritually. It's the hour to be alert. I I I believe that the Lord is depending on you and I and others. But you and I put ourselves in. Write yourself in. See yourself in it. And let's just humble ourselves to him for just a moment. Play something softly. And it doesn't have to be special. just just something that comes to your mind or heart and let us just talk to the Lord a minute as individuals not one doing all the praying but you also saying s I surrender Lord I know I may have surrendered last night in prayer I may have surrendered yesterday I may have said use me last week but again Lord I come today and I say whatever your will is whatever your way is cut the tether &gt;&gt; that holds me in this flesh realm and Let me see with spirit eyes the mind of God for this hour. Let me catch a fresh vision of what you want to do in your people. And and and and may I stop shoveling it on to someone else. Today is the day I quit shoveling. And today is the day that I say, Lord, if you can use anybody, why don't you just start right here in me? Sisters, you the same. Don't you know your ministry matters? Don't you know your life matters to your children first and to others that you would dare to live a life in front of? Move, spirit of God. Pick me up above my habits and my and my addiction and my and my uh time thieves and let me just surrender to you. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. Yes Lord, if you can use anyone, you can use me. And here I am to say, Lord, have your way. Put a fire in me, Lord. Like like fire in my bones. And if I would start to chill, let the fire of God rise up in me. Let the word of the Lord &gt;&gt; come rushing forth &gt;&gt; out of our lives, &gt;&gt; speaking life, not our thoughts, our opinions. &gt;&gt; But may we speak the word of the Lord into our families, into our circumstances, into our situations. Because position matters more in this hour than it has ever. Alliances and allegiances and positionings matter more in this hour than they've ever mattered before as we shape up for the final showdown. Lord, use us. Use us. Ben, get a microphone and just softly just start singing what they're playing &gt;&gt; again and again. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So I throw up my hands and praise you again and again. Cuz all that I have is a hallelujah. Oh, and I know it's not much, but I've nothing else for a king. &gt;&gt; What else could we give him? &gt;&gt; Except for a heart single. &gt;&gt; Come on. Oh, hallelujah. So I throw up my hands and praise you again and again cuz all that I have is a &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh and I know &gt;&gt; it's not much but I've nothing else fit for a king. Give him what you have &gt;&gt; except for a heart singing hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I give a highle &gt;&gt; and I know it's not much, &gt;&gt; but I've nothing else fit for a king. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, except for singing hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. So I throw up my hands and praise you again and again cuz all that I have is a hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We love you Lord. &gt;&gt; Tell him you love him right now. Lord, we love you. &gt;&gt; Let the hair grow back. &gt;&gt; Just once more, Lord. &gt;&gt; Singing hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Sing it out. Let them hear you. &gt;&gt; I got nothing new. How could I express? &gt;&gt; Oh my gratitude. &gt;&gt; Oh my gratitude. &gt;&gt; I could sing these songs &gt;&gt; as I often do. Every song must end. &gt;&gt; Oh, and you never do. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; So I throw up my hands and praise you again and again. &gt;&gt; Waiting on your spirit. &gt;&gt; Cuz all that I have waiting on your spirit. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I know it's not much, but I have nothing else to &gt;&gt; except for heart singing high. &gt;&gt; Let us find our place. &gt;&gt; Let us find our position today. I throw up my hands. Come on. and praise you again and again. &gt;&gt; Let life build around you &gt;&gt; cuz all that I have is &gt;&gt; Let the life of the Lord just build around you right now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I know it's not much, but I've nothing else. &gt;&gt; Let him give you a go ye. Let him put a go ye in your spirit. &gt;&gt; Heart sing it says move it. &gt;&gt; Move up. &gt;&gt; Woo. &gt;&gt; Move up. &gt;&gt; Move up, somebody. Woo. &gt;&gt; I've got one response. I've got just one move. Jesus, &gt;&gt; with my arms stretched wide, I will worship you. &gt;&gt; You told you praise was one of the ways. &gt;&gt; So I throw up my hands and praise you again. &gt;&gt; Perfect praise brings us to perfect that I have is a high. &gt;&gt; Perfect love is the key.
