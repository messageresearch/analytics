[0:00] i've had a portion of scripture on my
[0:02] heart i just don't seem to be able to
[0:05] get it off my mind
[0:06] i brought it to the congregation here in
[0:08] alabama and i even traveled with it but
[0:11] i want to share it with you today
[0:14] it's a scripture where jesus is speaking
[0:16] about the word
[0:18] about
[0:19] what we hear
[0:20] and what we do
[0:22] with what we hear
[0:24] i know that all of us have heard amazing
[0:28] sermons
[0:29] preached from god's word
[0:31] many with power and with demonstration
[0:34] but i think it's very very important
[0:37] that we are not just hearers but we are
[0:39] also doers
[0:41] and i also believe that there are new
[0:44] levels of revelation and glory that god
[0:47] wants to give us
[0:49] personally as individuals
[0:52] as we engage the word that we hear
[0:56] as we go back and revisit and we pray we
[1:00] ask the lord
[1:02] father i want you by the holy spirit to
[1:04] open these passages of scripture up to
[1:07] my life
[1:08] and i want to understand with revelation
[1:12] how to apply them
[1:13] how i should react how i should respond
[1:17] to your word
[1:18] i believe the bible is a written record
[1:21] of god's word
[1:22] i believe that jesus christ is the
[1:25] living word of god i believe he lives in
[1:29] us by the power of the holy ghost and i
[1:33] believe that it is his desire to unveil
[1:36] his word to you and i personally
[1:40] we know that scripture is going to line
[1:44] up with scripture and we know that
[1:46] anything god speaks to us in this day in
[1:49] this hour it must fit the scripture
[1:53] perfectly
[1:54] but when i'm talking about receiving a
[1:57] personal revelation from the word i'm
[1:59] talking about that quickening life that
[2:02] comes from the inside when god unveils
[2:07] or opens up a scripture to us personally
[2:10] shows us how to use it how to apply it
[2:14] in our life
[2:15] the scripture is mark chapter 4 verses
[2:18] 23 and 24. i want to read it from the
[2:22] amplified version of the bible it says
[2:24] if any man has ears to hear let him be
[2:27] listening
[2:28] and let him perceive and comprehend
[2:32] and he said to them
[2:34] be careful what
[2:36] you are hearing
[2:38] the measure of thought and study you
[2:41] give to the truth you hear will be the
[2:44] measure of virtue and knowledge that
[2:46] comes back to you and more besides
[2:50] will be given to you who hear
[2:53] i'm thinking about all of the hours
[2:56] in my life that i have spent reading
[2:59] god's word or hearing god's word
[3:02] and i'm thinking about all of those
[3:04] missed opportunities that i've had along
[3:07] the way
[3:08] to let that word become real to me
[3:11] personally and individually i guess
[3:14] we've got a lot of making up to do here
[3:16] in the end time but i think there's
[3:18] never been a more
[3:20] important
[3:21] moment in our lives than now
[3:24] i believe it is right now that god wants
[3:27] to make his word a living reality to you
[3:31] and i as individuals this living word
[3:36] you see i believe that we need like
[3:38] never before a revelation of who our god
[3:41] is
[3:43] and then we need a revelation of of who
[3:46] we are in god
[3:49] once we receive and understand who god
[3:52] is and who we are in him
[3:56] then we can get a revelation of who he
[3:59] is in us
[4:01] if he's living in us if this is the life
[4:04] of jesus christ living in me
[4:08] then it will produce
[4:10] his character his attributes
[4:14] if i am truly bone of his bone flesh of
[4:17] his flesh and spirit of his spirit
[4:20] then through my life jesus desires
[4:24] to live
[4:25] to finish his end time plan
[4:29] i'm not just talking about reading the
[4:31] word or
[4:32] hearing the word
[4:34] but i'm talking about reacting to what
[4:37] we hear
[4:38] jesus said here the measure of thought
[4:41] and study
[4:43] do you do you go back and
[4:45] ponder
[4:46] meditate sometimes we use the word
[4:49] ruminate because of the sheep
[4:54] we
[4:55] study
[4:56] we pray we ask the lord to quicken his
[5:00] word and make it real to us
[5:02] and then we not only have a reaction but
[5:05] we have a response
[5:07] and our response has to be to mix the
[5:10] word of god with our faith
[5:13] because that's what activates it in your
[5:16] life
