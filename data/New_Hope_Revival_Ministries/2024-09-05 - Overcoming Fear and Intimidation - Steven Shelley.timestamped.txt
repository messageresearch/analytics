[0:00] you need to stand up today break out of
[0:03] the spirit of timidity and cowardness
[0:06] Destroy from your life the spirit of
[0:08] fear and raise up in the courage and the
[0:11] boldness of the Lord and say enough is
[0:15] enough is enough is enough is
[0:20] enough I've listened to your lies the
[0:23] last
[0:26] time the slanderous adversary that
[0:30] hypocrite imitator lion likes to turn us
[0:33] against each
[0:35] other so that he can
[0:39] relax while we devour one another Chief
[0:43] Joseph said it that way and he often
[0:46] said this but in his address his initial
[0:48] inaugural address as leason to the
[0:51] government he said to his own people
[0:54] where the tribes of the nations were
[0:55] gathered together we have fought too
[0:59] many in significant Wars among
[1:03] ourselves Creek against Chu
[1:07] toown Apache against
[1:11] Cherokee and now that the real enemy has
[1:14] come we have fought so many
[1:16] insignificant Wars among ourselves and
[1:18] now that the real enemy has come we are
[1:20] too weak and
[1:24] defeated to stand against
[1:26] them that's why he decided we better try
[1:29] to cooperate operate or we'll have
[1:31] nothing left of the nation that we have
[1:34] possessed and held it could be the
[1:36] anthem of the
[1:38] church what Chief Joseph said about the
[1:40] Indian nations could be said about about
[1:43] Believers even around this message we
[1:46] fought so many insignificant Wars among
[1:49] ourselves that when the enemy shows up
[1:51] and here he is in the end time wanting
[1:54] to chew us up and swallow us for
[1:57] lunch you see the enemy is the
[1:59] counterfeit Lon and when he Roars he
[2:01] Roars to scare you into submission he's
[2:04] the greatest Intimidator of them all so
[2:07] don't be shocked that when a familiar
[2:09] Spirit operates around us it operates
[2:11] with an
[2:12] intimidation and a coercion to try to
[2:16] force people control people into doing
[2:19] what the devil wants them to do it is to
[2:21] intimidate us so that we give up and his
[2:24] tactic is to surround us and Corner us
[2:28] and to come at us from every direction
[2:31] so we break down emotionally and we give
[2:34] in and we let the devil have his way
[2:36] somebody ought to say Amen the
[2:38] intimidation will cause us to focus on
[2:40] the source of intimidation instead of
[2:43] Jesus who gives us victory over the
[2:45] intimidation Israel's attention was on
[2:47] the giant instead of the Giant Killer
[2:50] the more they focused on the giant the
[2:52] bigger the giant God their focus was an
[2:54] insult to God he could part the Red Sea
[2:57] but couldn't defeat one giant or a host
[3:00] of giants we must take our eyes off of
[3:03] that which is intimidating us and place
[3:05] our eyes on the one who gives us Supreme
[3:09] Victory and deliverance fear and
[3:11] intimidation will keep us from
[3:13] possessing God's promises that have
[3:15] already been given to us do you believe
[3:18] that
