[0:00] if you ignore praise you're stuck
[0:10] we are citizens of this world by natural
[0:14] but we are citizens of another dimension
[0:17] another world another kingdom
[0:19] by spiritual we get all focused on the
[0:23] natural
[0:23] of course we do because here's where our
[0:26] responsibilities get the best of us
[0:28] but i want you to know you and i can be
[0:31] better about our life over here
[0:33] if we get better about our fellowship
[0:35] over there
[0:36] the more fellowship we have with him and
[0:39] interaction with him in that realm
[0:42] by the word by the anointing by worship
[0:45] because i want you to know worship is
[0:48] going to be a key
[0:52] for the rod for us to come
[0:55] into the government of god if you ignore
[0:58] praise you're stuck it's because there's
[1:01] another realm once we get
[1:02] past extravagant praise
[1:06] we come to zion and what ushers forth
[1:10] from zion
[1:11] is in the atmosphere of worship once we
[1:14] are connected to him
[1:15] once we have praised our way into
[1:19] another dimension another realm where
[1:21] anointing
[1:23] starts giving way for glory and
[1:26] i know that most of us are not
[1:29] experiencing glory
[1:31] like we can and i want to experience
[1:35] more of that glory because it's been
[1:37] promised
[1:39] and that glory is not for feeling that
[1:42] glory is to transform us and i want you
[1:46] to know there are minds that will never
[1:48] be changed by the anointing
[1:52] there are paradigms it will never be
[1:54] changed by the anointing
[1:56] but oh as that person would
[1:59] maybe press in a little bit deeper and
[2:02] the anointing that final burst of
[2:05] anointing
[2:05] starts breaking yolks off and the glory
[2:09] starts streaming down
[2:11] into your heart i'm telling you you can
[2:13] usually feel a shift
[2:15] and when that when that changes like
[2:17] that you know you're connected
[2:19] and that's the time to be quiet
[2:22] and let god talk back to your heart
[2:25] boy if you're ever going to read the
[2:26] bible that's the time to read it
[2:29] if you're ever going to hear a sermon
[2:31] that's a great time
[2:32] to put put in a sermon when you know you
[2:34] have pressed past
[2:36] just anointing and feeling and you have
[2:38] gotten to a place where the glory of god
[2:40] is beginning to break open in your heart
