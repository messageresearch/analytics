[0:00] And if any of you have ever been in a
[0:02] situation like that where your choices
[0:05] brought on circumstances that squeezed
[0:07] you a little bit, you must also believe
[0:10] that God is sovereign.
[0:14] &gt;&gt; And your choice may have influenced
[0:16] where you are. Your the way you've lived
[0:18] your life may influence where you are,
[0:21] but but Satan didn't deliver you there.
[0:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[0:24] &gt;&gt; You were handd delivered by the one who
[0:27] loves you the most.
[0:29] He will take us to trials because he
[0:32] wants to purify us
[0:34] &gt;&gt; and get the nature out of us that is
[0:37] unlike him.
[0:38] &gt;&gt; He will.
[0:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[0:40] &gt;&gt; He'll carry us into sticky situations
[0:43] and and times of rejection and
[0:45] misunderstanding.
[0:47] And he does that because he wants to
[0:49] heal us. Somebody say, "Well, that don't
[0:51] feel like healing." Well, you've got to
[0:53] wait it out
[0:55] &gt;&gt; because there's healing on the other
[0:57] end. How many of you still believe
[0:59] there's a testimony at the end of the
[1:01] test
[1:03] &gt;&gt; ALWAYS? THAT'S WHO GOD IS.
[1:06] &gt;&gt; And the Bible tells us it's not the one
[1:08] that starts off and and THEN TURNS TO
[1:11] THE SIDE. It's the one who endures to
[1:15] the end, the one who runs the race all
[1:19] the way past the finish line.
[1:23] &gt;&gt; Some people say to the finish line. Try
[1:25] it.
[1:27] Try that.
[1:28] &gt;&gt; Next race you're running, I don't know
[1:30] how many races you run, but the next one
[1:32] you run, stop at the finish line. See if
[1:35] that helps. You're not stopping at the
[1:37] finish line. You got to cross it.
[1:40] &gt;&gt; And usually the momentum that you've
[1:42] picked up on the way will make it a
[1:45] little bit hard to put on brakes.
[1:47] &gt;&gt; How many of you want to burst into
[1:48] eternity like that?
[1:50] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WHEN I GET THERE, I JUST BURST
[1:53] IN.
[1:56] BECAUSE I COULDN'T SLOW DOWN.
[1:59] &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU SLOW DOWN, BROTHER.
[2:01] &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU SLOW DOWN, SISTER. IF YOU'RE
[2:03] GOING to run a race, RUN WITH ALL. RUN
[2:05] WITH EVERYTHING. Come on.
[2:08] &gt;&gt; Don't wear your fair coat to run this
[2:10] race.
[2:11] &gt;&gt; It'll weight you down.
[2:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not not physically now, but but
[2:16] spiritually strip off
[2:18] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE'S A RACE TO FINISH
[2:20] &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S A FINISH line to cross.
[2:24] &gt;&gt; And we don't want to stop short of the
[2:25] victory.
[2:26] &gt;&gt; If you need to beat the ground a little
[2:28] bit more, do it. If you need to grab the
[2:30] arrows and beat again, do it. If you
[2:32] need to pray a little harder, do it. If
[2:34] you need to worship A LITTLE WILDER, DO
[2:36] IT.
[2:37] &gt;&gt; WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO, don't stop
[2:39] short.
[2:40] &gt;&gt; There's a victory. There's a victory
[2:42] over there, brother, sister. There's one
[2:44] standing on the other side of the finish
[2:47] line, ready to welcome you in his arms.
[2:51] &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE IF WE WILL STAY IN OUR LANE,
[2:54] GOD WILL USE EVERY ONE OF US FOR THE
[2:58] ADVANCEMENT OF HIS KINGDOM. I DON'T WANT
[3:00] one to be LEFT BEHIND. I DON'T WANT ONE
[3:03] TO FALL TO THE WAYSIDE. I DON'T WANT ONE
[3:06] TO JUST WARM THE PEW. I WANT US ALL TO
[3:09] BE USED FOR THE sake of the kingdom of
[3:12] God.
