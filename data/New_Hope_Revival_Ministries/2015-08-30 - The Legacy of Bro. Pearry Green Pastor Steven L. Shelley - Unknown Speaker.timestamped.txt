[4:18] amen s-sir testimony job live that
[4:24] before the Holy Ghost was available and
[4:27] he still had that testimony I trust God
[4:31] would give us all that grace and that
[4:34] anointing to give us even what Joe bad
[4:38] to be able to have that testimony though
[4:42] he slay me yet I'll trust you it's a
[4:46] privilege and honor to ask brother Steve
[4:48] Shelly to come up family he's requested
[4:50] longtime friend
[4:52] I knew Steve when he was j hi2 now he
[4:55] was actually about my age so anyway I
[4:57] can tell a story on her but it's good
[5:00] have those steve shelley with us and i
[5:02] trust that he would find the mind of the
[5:04] lord and you just pull and not push god
[5:08] bless you
[5:14] praise the Lord I appreciate the
[5:18] presence of the Lord in this place
[5:19] already don't you I want to greet you in
[5:23] the mighty and precious name of the Lord
[5:25] Jesus Christ I want to say to the family
[5:28] that you have given me the greatest
[5:30] honor of my life thank you for asking me
[5:33] to share in this moment with you I do
[5:36] not feel worthy and I recognize that
[5:39] there are other ministers in this room
[5:41] who are more qualified and much better
[5:43] speakers than I I'm deeply humbled but I
[5:46] am reporting for duty let me also say
[5:50] that I will read most of my thoughts and
[5:52] that is as much for your sake as it is
[5:56] for mine that way I won't ramble nearly
[5:58] as much in my nervousness and one more
[6:02] thing I will most likely cry and I
[6:07] brought a stack just in case one was not
[6:09] enough and there are no apologies for
[6:13] that my head is a leaky head and it's
[6:17] because my grandmother told me when I
[6:19] was just starting out it's okay to cry
[6:22] son it's alright to leak a leaky head
[6:25] rarely swells
[6:28] so I'm a leak the last few lines of a
[6:36] Longfellow poem the psalm of life that
[6:38] brother branham often quoted to us lives
[6:42] of great men all remind us we can make
[6:46] our lives sublime and departing leave
[6:50] behind us footprints on the sands of
[6:54] time footprints that perhaps another
[6:57] sailing or life's solemn main a forlorn
[7:02] and shipwrecked brother seeing shall
[7:05] take heart again let us then be up and
[7:09] doing with a heart for any fate still
[7:14] achieving still pursuing learn to labor
[7:17] and to wait the Apostle Paul said in
[7:21] first Corinthians chapter 4 verse 15 for
[7:24] though ye have ten thousand instructors
[7:27] in Christ yet you have not many fathers
[7:31] for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you
[7:34] through the gospel everyone leaves
[7:38] behind a legacy after they die but only
[7:40] a few people leave behind a legacy worth
[7:43] talking about a legacy is the story of
[7:48] someone's life it is the things they did
[7:51] the places they went the goals that they
[7:53] accomplished even their failures make up
[7:56] their legacy legacy is a mark left
[8:00] behind to be remembered by
[8:01] perhaps the part of a person that lives
[8:04] on long after that person has departed
[8:07] this life our examples become pathways
[8:11] that sometimes guide people in the
[8:14] decisions that they make what to do and
[8:18] sometimes even what not to do for
[8:21] instance when we think of brother
[8:23] Branham so many things come to mind
[8:25] about his character one of which would
[8:28] be his legacy of humility and of total
[8:32] yielded nice to God this inspires us to
[8:37] ask God for more grace grace that we
[8:41] might walk
[8:42] for him in greater humility and in true
[8:45] yielded 'no status the desire of every
[8:47] believer we want to follow in the
[8:50] example of the Prophet who has gone
[8:52] before us we also recognize that some
[8:56] have left legacies that have served more
[8:59] to show us what we do not want to do or
[9:04] how not to behave this can also be a
[9:08] positive force in shaping us to become
[9:11] better Christians better citizens better
[9:14] neighbors sometimes the ability to
[9:17] identify the failures of those who have
[9:20] walked before us can be extremely
[9:23] important so that we do not
[9:25] inadvertently continue the cycle or
[9:28] repeating the same mistakes leaving
[9:31] behind a greater wake of pain and
[9:33] devastation but it is too late after we
[9:36] are gone to think about the legacy that
[9:39] we are leaving behind it behooves us all
[9:42] as children of God to examine our lives
[9:45] now and to check to see if we are
[9:48] creating a legacy example worthy to be
[9:52] followed is it an example worthy of the
[9:55] gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ is it an
[9:59] example worthy of the message of the
[10:01] hour the revelation of Jesus Christ it
[10:05] should be the desire of any godly people
[10:08] group to spare the next generation the
[10:11] pain of having to learn everything the
[10:14] hard way and yet we hear people around
[10:17] us often say things like oh they just
[10:21] want a shortcut they don't want to pay
[10:23] the price like we paid so let them learn
[10:27] themselves when they hit rock bottom
[10:30] they'll come asking us running to us for
[10:33] help something is seriously awry that
[10:37] should not be our attitude at all while
[10:41] it may be true church that some things
[10:44] are better caught than taught and that
[10:47] some folks will not remember or benefit
[10:49] from a lesson that they did not
[10:51] personally experience it is also true
[10:55] that there are many eager and hungry
[10:57] young folk out there who end in here who
[11:01] wait to hear the experiences of those
[11:04] who have been there and already done
[11:07] that we have to stop and take the time
[11:09] now to consider the example that we are
[11:12] setting before them god help me
[11:15] we must stop and not only become
[11:18] teachers for teachers can become a dime
[11:22] a dozen but there is a real need in the
[11:26] body of Christ and even a real need in
[11:29] the world at large for legitimate
[11:32] fathers in Jesus Christ
[11:35] a generation striving to display the
[11:38] characteristics and attributes truths
[11:41] and revelations we must be vigilant in
[11:45] our efforts to continue to prepare the
[11:48] way we must consciously strive to gather
[11:50] out the stones of stumbling and raise
[11:53] the blood-stained banner of holiness and
[11:56] truth high in this wicked hour just as
[12:01] Isaiah prophesied hear me please
[12:03] go through go through the gates prepare
[12:07] ye the way of the people cast up the
[12:11] highway gather out the stones lift up a
[12:16] standard for the people behold the LORD
[12:19] hath proclaimed unto the end of the
[12:21] world say ye to the daughter of Zion
[12:24] behold thy salvation cometh behold his
[12:28] reward is with him and his work is
[12:31] before him and they shall call them the
[12:34] holy people the redeemed of the Lord and
[12:38] thou shalt be called sought-out a city
[12:42] not Forsaken we must therefore assist
[12:45] not only our children but others who
[12:48] have a desire to learn of the things
[12:51] that some of us have been blessed to
[12:53] hear for so long now and we must set the
[12:56] legacy example for them by obeying the
[12:59] Word of God that we have heard even as
[13:02] we also continue to grow in grace in
[13:05] Satan's Eden there is a Miskin
[13:08] sited and misplaced understanding of
[13:10] what a true hero really is
[13:14] would you agree children are often heard
[13:17] to say about a sports star or some pop
[13:20] star singer I want to be just like him I
[13:24] want to be just like her even actors and
[13:27] actresses are set up as role models and
[13:29] they're unhealthy and/or ungodly habits
[13:32] are styles that are often copied by the
[13:36] masses and the church has not dodged the
[13:39] same trend and neither have some of our
[13:41] own assemblies and this should not be
[13:45] what a shame it is in our society when
[13:49] blatant and in-your-face perversion is
[13:52] celebrated as courageous and heroic
[13:54] while policemen and firemen those who
[13:58] serve in the branches of our military
[14:00] are often overlooked as heroes when
[14:04] missionaries risk their lives and the
[14:07] lives of their families to take the good
[14:09] news of Jesus Christ to the far reaches
[14:12] of planet Earth to take the message of
[14:14] the hour to those who have never heard
[14:17] laboring to shine a light to the darkest
[14:20] lives blinded by sin and false religion
[14:23] these men and women are real heroes
[14:27] paving a legacy path for others to
[14:30] follow
[14:31] pointing souls to Jesus and telling them
[14:34] that we all need a genuine born-again
[14:37] experience to anchor us to the Word of
[14:41] God every person you're gonna want
[14:43] you're wondering I know what is any of
[14:45] this got to do a brother green is coming
[14:49] probably every person under the sound of
[14:52] my voice can quote or is at least
[14:55] familiar with what some of us have
[14:56] called the theme of brother branham's
[14:59] ministry hebrews 13 and 8 says jesus
[15:02] christ the same yesterday and today and
[15:04] forever and indeed he is how true these
[15:09] words are and how genuinely they have
[15:11] been demonstrated for us just a
[15:14] generation ago however most of us are
[15:17] not familiar with the verse prior to
[15:19] that passage
[15:20] that favorite passage of brother branham
[15:23] Hebrews 13 and 7 the verse before says
[15:26] this remember them which have the rule
[15:29] over you who have spoken unto you the
[15:33] Word of God whose faith follow
[15:37] considering the end of their
[15:40] conversation and then verse 8 follows
[15:43] Jesus Christ the same yesterday I'm
[15:47] going to do an unpopular thing I've read
[15:50] from the King James but I'm going to
[15:53] quote in another version don't throw
[15:55] anything at me please
[15:56] the Amplified Bible says remember your
[16:00] leaders and superiors in authority for
[16:04] it was they who brought to you the Word
[16:07] of God observe attentively and this can
[16:12] mean to examine carefully and even to
[16:15] scrutinize which suggests to look at
[16:18] through a magnifying glass or to go
[16:21] through their lives with a fine-tooth
[16:23] comb and consider their manner of living
[16:27] the outcome of their well-spent lives
[16:30] and this is the phrase that I think is
[16:33] so outstanding and imitate their faith
[16:38] imitate their faith the literal meaning
[16:42] of following their faith in King James
[16:45] is to imitate it not to imitate them
[16:49] which can sometimes become a uniform for
[16:52] folks with mannerisms and belt buckles
[16:55] etc just trying to identify but there is
[16:59] a much higher way to be identified with
[17:02] the truth a man the original words here
[17:07] do not suggest that we become an
[17:09] imitation or an impersonation of these
[17:12] men who have gone before us it does not
[17:15] indicate that we should impersonate or
[17:17] or in or be an imitation of their
[17:20] personality but rather that we become a
[17:25] carbon copy a genuine duplicate of their
[17:29] faith we are implored here by the
[17:32] Apostle to follow carefully in the
[17:35] footsteps of their faith the manner in
[17:38] which they relied on God with complete
[17:41] trust and confidence and to model our
[17:44] lives after that part of who they were
[17:49] by now you're wondering what all this
[17:51] has to do with brother green and since I
[17:54] haven't barely mentioned his name thus
[17:57] far but even without directly mentioning
[18:01] his name after every sentence this
[18:04] message has everything to do with
[18:07] brother green to meet brother green now
[18:10] this is going to be a little repetitive
[18:12] but and if I would have had a pencil and
[18:15] paper I would have just marked it off as
[18:17] brother caleb was speaking and brother
[18:19] and brother Dale was speaking and
[18:21] brother Richard speaking but it's
[18:22] electronic and I couldn't mark it off
[18:24] and I'd lose my place
[18:25] so I'm going to read it anyway to meet
[18:28] brother green was to encounter a person
[18:31] bigger than life itself be reminded for
[18:35] a moment of the first time you met
[18:37] brother green and what he might have
[18:38] said or how you may have felt and you'll
[18:41] probably concur with me that your life
[18:44] was somehow never the same after that I
[18:48] remember well the first time I met him
[18:51] I'd heard his sermons I'd heard his
[18:54] testimony
[18:54] I had read Acts of the Prophet but it
[18:57] was on the platform of the Mesa Church
[19:00] where our dear brother carpenter has
[19:02] faithfully served God all these years I
[19:05] was invited to speak for the Arizona
[19:08] fellowship meetings so you know it was a
[19:10] long time ago it was a Friday night
[19:14] November the 1st 1991 it'll soon be 24
[19:19] years ago I came out of the office and
[19:22] he grabbed me with a bear hug brother
[19:25] Steve I'm brother green welcome to
[19:28] Arizona and my life was different in
[19:33] many ways from that hug forward I would
[19:40] then preach at the Tabernacle over 20
[19:42] services
[19:43] in the following few months those tapes
[19:46] were then heard around the world and
[19:48] doors were opened for my ministry in
[19:50] many nations my life was certainly
[19:53] brighter and a whole lot busier because
[19:56] I had been hugged by brother green in
[19:59] the years that followed many things
[20:01] transpired I'm going to be very
[20:03] transparent and I hope I don't make you
[20:05] too uncomfortable in the years that
[20:08] followed many things transpired and in
[20:10] my youthful zeal and my religious fervor
[20:13] matched with my own ignorance I without
[20:23] intent without malice disappointed
[20:28] brother green it was never what I wanted
[20:32] to do sister green but nonetheless it's
[20:36] our history I didn't hear from him for a
[20:40] while like I had grown accustomed to he
[20:43] just simply backed off and really it
[20:47] didn't feel like the right thing at the
[20:48] time but it was the right thing for me
[20:50] and I just did what I'd always done when
[20:54] I knew that I had hurt or disappointed
[20:55] someone that I greatly respected I
[20:58] pulled away and the years ticked by
[21:02] making it even harder to reconnect I'm
[21:06] sharing this today thinking that I may
[21:10] not be the only person who has
[21:14] experienced a temporary setback in their
[21:17] relationship with this great general of
[21:20] the faith brother Green was sometimes
[21:23] referred to as the Paul Harvey of the
[21:25] message because he was so good to dig
[21:28] and find the treasures the details that
[21:31] others did not see and with this
[21:33] generous heart he would share them with
[21:35] all of us and with Saints around the
[21:36] world of course this reference to Paul
[21:39] Harvey will be lost today on those of
[21:42] you from a younger generation but for
[21:44] the rest of us I'm sharing this personal
[21:48] part of my relationship and friendship
[21:49] with brother Greene because it is really
[21:52] the rest of the story what I want to get
[21:55] to
[21:56] that I want to share I remember pacing
[21:59] back and forth in the den of my home
[22:01] that afternoon palms sweaty mouth dry
[22:04] hmm kind of like right now now the phone
[22:11] is ringing it's too late to hang up my
[22:14] heart is beating fast rings once twice
[22:21] three times oh good he's not at home I
[22:24] can leave a message and then the ringing
[22:27] stopped and that voice boomed in my ear
[22:30] hello this is brother Greene brother
[22:35] Greene this is Steve Shelley Steve what
[22:41] took you so long
[22:49] well at least I knew that it was okay to
[22:52] be calling him but I had to make a quick
[22:59] and important point so I said well
[23:03] brother green may I just humbly suggest
[23:06] that the telephone works both ways
[23:12] silence one two three four five maybe
[23:17] ten seconds of silence I nearly died and
[23:29] then there was a shift in his tone as he
[23:32] said you are exactly right
[23:36] he said now we have lots to catch up on
[23:39] and that we did and we never spoke again
[23:43] of how I had disappointed him it was
[23:47] over someone said did you iron it out no
[23:51] we didn't discuss it ever again it was
[23:55] just done it was finished and I'm so
[23:57] glad it was I want you to help me ponder
[24:00] a question that's been in my heart for
[24:03] some time now it's a question about
[24:05] legacy and one legacy in particular the
[24:08] legacy of our dear friend and brother
[24:11] what is the legacy of Perry green my
[24:16] time this afternoon of course would
[24:18] never allow me to skim the surface of
[24:20] the contributions that he has made to
[24:23] believers around the world some of which
[24:24] have been mentioned but I might just
[24:26] stick in a few here he started printing
[24:30] brother branham's sermons in booklet
[24:31] form even while brother Branham was
[24:33] still alive and in those early days he
[24:36] printed books like 20th century prophet
[24:38] in the seven churches book he was
[24:40] responsible for putting in place the
[24:42] telephone system the hookups that
[24:44] allowed people congregations to hear the
[24:48] sermons and fell apart if they couldn't
[24:50] travel across the country every meeting
[24:52] where brother Branham was speaking I
[24:54] wonder how many tens of thousands of
[24:56] people are now grateful for that effort
[24:58] alone he was so instrumental in
[25:00] spreading the truth of the
[25:01] message across the world with a handful
[25:03] of dedicated pioneers traveling the
[25:06] nations to share the light that it
[25:08] shined in their day and some of those
[25:10] pioneers are in this service imagine how
[25:13] I feel standing here speaking to them
[25:15] about their contributions brother green
[25:19] took his testimony and sermon into 135
[25:23] Nations remaining faithful to the verse
[25:25] that was already mentioned for we cannot
[25:27] but Speak the things which we have seen
[25:30] and heard but again I want to read it
[25:33] from another version just quickly I was
[25:37] with brother
[25:38] green in Jerusalem I think the last time
[25:40] he was there Janet was with us and a
[25:44] friend of mine had put together some
[25:46] years ago a beautiful Jewish
[25:49] understanding of the New Testament the
[25:51] Old Testament is well called the
[25:53] complete Jewish Bible I took it off the
[25:55] shelf one morning early
[25:57] when brother green had come down and I
[26:00] said I'd like to read you your
[26:01] commission from the complete Jewish
[26:03] Bible well he said I'd love to hear that
[26:05] and I read it x4 20 complete Jewish
[26:09] Bible asks for us we can't help talking
[26:12] about what we have actually seen and
[26:16] heard did he ever chuckle because
[26:21] brother green truly could not help
[26:24] talking about those things that he had
[26:28] witnessed and many of us in this room
[26:30] are very glad that he could not stop the
[26:35] last hours that I was able to spend with
[26:37] brother green in June when he sent for
[26:40] us I say that because it means the world
[26:43] to me
[26:44] and we sat there and and he told stories
[26:48] I knew better I don't know why Caleb
[26:52] didn't learn not to interrupt I knew
[26:56] better take some people little longer I
[26:59] guess
[27:01] my sweet wife and sister greens sitting
[27:04] on us on a swing the fountain gurgling
[27:08] brother green sitting there without his
[27:10] oxygen it was a little shadowy he you
[27:13] know we weren't like staring into one
[27:15] another's eyes and so to me he looked
[27:18] like brother green as I'd always known
[27:21] him full of life full of health but in
[27:24] reality that wasn't quite the situation
[27:26] and my wife and sister Green were just
[27:29] catching up and chatting very quietly to
[27:32] one another but it bothered brother
[27:34] green immensely and he started by saying
[27:39] Janis I called brother and sister Shelly
[27:42] here because brother Steven his wife
[27:45] here too to speak to them honey and I
[27:47] want them to hear what I'm saying
[27:50] and so they hushed for a few minutes
[27:55] something else crossed their mind they
[27:58] started chirping again and he said the
[28:00] second time would you all please let me
[28:03] finish the story and again a few minutes
[28:07] later they chirped again and he looked
[28:08] at me and he said can you do something
[28:11] or yes my wife hadn't spent as many
[28:20] hours with brother bean as I had and so
[28:22] I said sweetheart please and she did
[28:30] after another hour and a half of stories
[28:33] he looked at me and he said all Steve
[28:35] you've heard all these stories before
[28:38] you don't want to hear them again do you
[28:41] yes sir I want to hear them in every
[28:45] detail because if I know you they will
[28:48] be the exact same story that you told me
[28:51] 24 years ago I want to hear it one more
[28:55] time he couldn't help talking about it
[29:01] he was responsible for the films you've
[29:04] heard how many of us have or have had
[29:07] read volume books in our home and what
[29:12] about the black mind the the book
[29:14] sermons that were bound in in black
[29:16] covers that preceded those we all
[29:20] realized that brother green did not
[29:22] accomplish these things on his own as
[29:24] brother Richard has pointed out there
[29:26] was always a group of dedicated brothers
[29:27] and sisters and I'll just skip that but
[29:30] it's not because you're not worthy
[29:32] you're so worthy of our gratitude all of
[29:38] our gratitudes gratitudes all of our
[29:41] gratitude see I better stay right with
[29:44] the notes here we realized that he
[29:48] didn't do it alone there were seed
[29:49] libraries sent and printing of the
[29:50] supernatural series and Israel tours and
[29:53] tours of Jeff and Sunset tours and
[29:55] Tucson tours but I want to ask you a
[29:59] question was this the legacy of brother
[30:03] Perry Green what about his precious
[30:05] family sister green his beautiful three
[30:08] daughters their spouse's grandchildren
[30:10] and greats and his sister Sammy and the
[30:13] siblings that are in the sibling in
[30:15] heaven and and all the relatives gone on
[30:18] I didn't have an opportunity to meet
[30:20] brother greens dad but I sure loved the
[30:24] opportunity to meet granny green all of
[30:28] them nieces and nephews and it ripples
[30:31] on I don't know about you but I love the
[30:34] green family I do because brother green
[30:39] loved them and therefore I love them too
[30:43] some of you understand that don't you
[30:47] they're most definitely a big part of
[30:49] his legacy and family I want to thank
[30:52] you we all want to thank you in fact the
[30:54] bride around the world thanks you for
[30:56] the times that you shared him with us
[30:59] and after I wrote that I realized it
[31:03] didn't sound quite accurate so I'll try
[31:07] again I realized at times for you it
[31:10] felt more like you had given him to us
[31:13] or perhaps that we had just stolen him
[31:17] away from you we're sorry for the times
[31:24] that we may have done just that but
[31:27] today we are grateful for your
[31:29] sacrifices
[31:32] [Applause]
[31:42] amen
[31:48] thank you sister green for all those
[31:50] fateful years of loving brother green
[31:55] and supporting him and of taking such
[31:57] good care of him
[31:59] with your potions and treatments so that
[32:05] we could have him as long as we did
[32:07] sister green we love you and honor you
[32:33] amen
[32:39] if brother green was truly a father in
[32:42] Israel and I believe he was then we're
[32:45] all so blessed to have had a mother in
[32:47] Israel brother Branham told him that the
[32:52] one in his birthday meant he was good at
[32:54] starting things and described him to
[32:56] sister Branham as a man who could get
[32:58] things done when brother Branham except
[33:00] when brother green accepted the call to
[33:02] come with sister green from Texas to
[33:05] Tucson to raise up a church and there
[33:07] remains a group of faithful brothers and
[33:10] sisters to this day at that Tabernacle
[33:12] that where the brand of the
[33:15] double-crosses titi tucson tabernacle
[33:19] and we honor and thank all of you - we
[33:22] love you thank you so much for sharing
[33:24] your pastor with us but is that his
[33:27] legacy for which of these things will he
[33:30] be most remembered
[33:31] maybe that all depends on which of these
[33:34] things are or other things not mentioned
[33:36] may have had the greatest impact on your
[33:39] life but I want to humbly suggest that
[33:43] legacy has to be more than someone's
[33:46] accomplishments it has to extend far
[33:48] beyond the tangible or even the temporal
[33:51] one of the true definitions of legacy
[33:54] and heritage is any attribute or
[33:57] immaterial possession that is inherited
[34:00] from ancestors recordings and books and
[34:03] mission trips and great eyewitness
[34:06] accounts are amazing contributions to us
[34:09] all and all of these things have
[34:11] enriched our lives and certainly have
[34:13] their esteemed place in the tapestry of
[34:17] the legacy of brother Perry Greene but
[34:20] the legacy of brother Perry Greene who
[34:23] was bigger than life itself must also be
[34:26] something bigger something greater
[34:28] something more far-reaching it must
[34:32] extend to the lessons that he taught us
[34:35] that have inspired us and molded us into
[34:38] who we are today it is true that brother
[34:42] Perry Greene loved deeply brother
[34:46] Branham and that was obvious when he
[34:49] shared wherever he was but I also wanted
[34:53] to be
[34:53] membered about him that he loved the
[34:57] Lord Jesus Christ with his whole heart
[35:08] that is what compelled him that is what
[35:12] compelled him to go forward to share the
[35:14] good news he believed in a personal
[35:17] relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ
[35:19] he believed that it's necessary to
[35:21] experience the new birth to be
[35:23] sanctified by the washing of the water
[35:25] by the word and he believed in the
[35:28] genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[35:31] fire this too must be added to the list
[35:36] of things that he taught us in his
[35:39] ministry brother green was also a man of
[35:42] grace I'm moving along
[35:44] he knew the grace that had been extended
[35:47] in his salvation and he was willing to
[35:49] believe God for that same grace in all
[35:53] of our lives he was not quick to throw
[35:57] someone away because they stumbled or
[36:00] failed or drew criticism from their
[36:06] particular style of doing ministry
[36:09] brother Greenwood preached to us about
[36:12] Thomas and he said what a shame it was
[36:15] that he was better known for being a
[36:17] doubter when all he really had was a
[36:20] brief moment of weakness he told us that
[36:23] people too quickly forgot that it was
[36:25] Thomas who in the book of John
[36:27] anticipated the threat to the life of
[36:30] Jesus if he returned to Judea after the
[36:33] death of Lazarus but in that moment with
[36:35] courage
[36:36] Thomas boldly proclaimed in chapter 11
[36:39] verse 16 let us also go that we may die
[36:43] with him
[36:45] brother Greene was so impressed with
[36:48] state with a statement like that from
[36:50] Thomas brother Greene did not believe
[36:52] that failure had to be final with Jesus
[36:55] let this be a part of his legacy
[36:59] remember this that he loved folks even
[37:04] if they had slipped even if they had
[37:06] failed and even if they had wronged or
[37:09] betrayed him personally please don't
[37:13] think that I am here to try to convince
[37:15] you that he was a perfect man
[37:18] for he too was broken don't hurt me
[37:24] sister Sammy he too was broken and
[37:28] flawed he failed as we also failed but
[37:34] because he believed in the power of
[37:35] God's forgiveness and in the power of
[37:38] His mercy and grace he kept on keeping
[37:43] on on more than one occasion brother
[37:47] green described to me personally and
[37:50] probably to others in this room this day
[37:55] yesterday he told me things to look for
[37:58] and I have and then he would see me
[38:04] boiling and he would say please remember
[38:10] son it is not your obligation to get
[38:14] them to love you but it is your
[38:18] obligation to love them this was a
[38:22] constant theme in brother Green's life I
[38:25] won't say it again you've heard him say
[38:27] it over and over again it is not your
[38:30] obligation to get them to love you but
[38:33] it is your obligation to love them that
[38:35] is so powerful it's powerful this was a
[38:40] constant a consistent theme in his
[38:43] ministry is life the entire time that I
[38:46] knew him he wanted you for a friend even
[38:49] if some of his other friends didn't want
[38:51] him to be your friend did you follow
[38:54] that as brother branham said drawing
[38:57] bigger circles which is just simply
[39:00] drawing folks back in with your crayon
[39:02] that have used their crayon to draw you
[39:05] out this sometimes requires us to lay
[39:08] down our prejudices against one another
[39:10] to forgive even if that person never
[39:14] gets around to asking you for
[39:17] forgiveness are you with me forgiveness
[39:19] is more often for ourselves anyway than
[39:23] it really is for the other person
[39:25] because when we forgive we are setting
[39:27] ourselves free
[39:29] while some folks seem to not want others
[39:31] to make it
[39:34] you ever heard conversations like that I
[39:37] have it just sounded like somebody
[39:41] didn't want somebody to make it all the
[39:43] way brother green that was not him I saw
[39:48] in him a desire for us all to make it
[39:51] again this is a huge part of his legacy
[39:54] it may not be a part that you can hold
[39:56] in your hand or visit as a shrine or a
[39:59] memorial but it is a legacy example that
[40:03] is for us all to follow unlike a lot of
[40:06] us preachers brother green actually
[40:08] liked preachers even the ones that did
[40:15] not agree with him boy that's a hard one
[40:18] but it is possible when we realize that
[40:21] we are not the master and it is not up
[40:24] to us but it is up to him and him alone
[40:26] if another one of his servants should
[40:29] stand or fall it has become so easy for
[40:32] us today to split and to divide to even
[40:36] bite and devour I say this so humbly I
[40:39] don't deserve this opportunity to say
[40:42] this to you this is not a scold or a
[40:44] rebuke I'm caught up I'm caught up in
[40:48] the inspiration of a life that's been
[40:50] lived before me and I'm determined to
[40:53] walk in those legacy footsteps it's been
[40:57] easy for us seems to split and divide
[40:59] and even buy it in devour one another
[41:01] but let me just quote some of my Jewish
[41:04] friends that is not kosher and let me
[41:08] tell you how I know that according to
[41:11] Deuteronomy 14 12 among the birds that
[41:14] we should not eat is the eagle
[41:26] if somebody else would have said that
[41:28] you two liked it better but it's still
[41:32] the truth
[41:32] you're still the truth how easy it can
[41:36] be when we're often surrounded by other
[41:37] Eagles to just reach in and take a bite
[41:41] out of one another but with the help of
[41:44] the Lord we can commit today to carry on
[41:47] a part of brother Greene's legacy we can
[41:50] lay down our swords and even our forks
[41:53] and knives and we can make a pledge to
[41:56] quit eating Eagles
[42:05] another legacy lesson he was a faithful
[42:08] man faithful to the one who had called
[42:11] him and faithful to the Commission that
[42:13] he carried boldly and without apology
[42:15] testifying of the things that he saw and
[42:17] heard brother Greenwood go we're invited
[42:20] if he had the opportunity to share his
[42:22] testimony and I personally witnessed a
[42:25] couple things I want to share I saw this
[42:28] humility in action when he was invited
[42:30] to speak in several gatherings of who
[42:32] Pentecostal and charismatic friends I
[42:35] had been assigned to help him navigate
[42:37] the culture of an unfamiliar people to
[42:40] him
[42:40] so I properly warned him of the way that
[42:44] some would be dressed and that their
[42:46] worship would certainly be a bit
[42:48] different than what we were used to but
[42:50] I wish you all could have seen him
[42:52] especially those who criticized him for
[42:55] going I wished you could have seen him
[42:59] that very first night among those folks
[43:03] he walked up on that stage and loosened
[43:06] his tie because he recognized he was the
[43:08] only one wearing one in the building
[43:09] including me and he did ask me where it
[43:13] was he sat down to be interviewed by her
[43:17] friend Paul Keith and then he started
[43:19] doing something I wasn't familiar with
[43:21] he started untying his shoes I'm sitting
[43:26] there right close to the front and I'm
[43:27] thinking oh wow oh no what is he doing
[43:31] brother green went on to take his shoes
[43:34] off set them on the chair beside him I'm
[43:41] thinking oh love oh oh what will he say
[43:45] what will he do next I just hoped that
[43:50] he would leave his socks on
[43:54] and then he said something he said I
[43:59] just wanted to take off my shoes to
[44:01] honor the presence of the Lord among you
[44:05] people people sitting around me started
[44:10] weeping because truly the presence of
[44:12] the Lord then flooded the room of over
[44:15] 500 people 30 minutes before that he
[44:18] said to me in the speaker's room Steve
[44:21] do you think these people will like me
[44:26] will they really want to listen to my
[44:29] stories about brother Branham they don't
[44:31] know so much about it they've read all
[44:33] the garbage about him on the Internet
[44:35] you think that I reassured him that they
[44:38] would love him as I always had he even
[44:41] asked me holding up the pouch of prayer
[44:44] cloths prayed over by brother Branham on
[44:46] that final departure from Tucson to
[44:48] Jeffersonville he said do you think
[44:50] anyone here would like to have one of
[44:51] these I said brother Greene you just
[44:55] better be careful when you lift it up
[44:57] that they don't knock you off the
[44:58] platform to get one but he was still a
[45:02] bit unsure but there he was being
[45:05] faithful not judging who was and who was
[45:08] not just sharing what he knew to be the
[45:11] truth but he was still unprepared for
[45:13] the rush to the front of the room when
[45:16] he offered those folks a cloth prayed
[45:19] over by brother Branham and the look on
[45:21] his face was priceless we do not all
[45:25] have the same callings or Commission's
[45:26] but we too must be faithful to the call
[45:28] that God has placed in our lives amen
[45:31] you'd never think of a confident man
[45:34] like brother Greene being discouraged
[45:35] would you but it happened if you only
[45:41] knew the surface of brother Perry Greene
[45:42] then you would you might have thought
[45:45] well I met a confident man sometimes
[45:47] with a rough exterior and if that's all
[45:50] you knew about him then you only knew
[45:52] one dimension of who he was indeed he
[45:55] was a driven man driven by passion to
[45:57] finish the tasks that he had been called
[45:59] to but he was also wounded when his
[46:03] words and actions
[46:05] or his approach to the message was
[46:06] rejected or misunderstood he did care
[46:10] even if he said at times like we all
[46:13] have I don't care what people think he
[46:16] did care what people thought about him
[46:18] and it did hurt him when someone would
[46:22] say that he did not believe the message
[46:24] that he had given his entire life for
[46:31] but he didn't let it stop him never he
[46:36] would press through the discouragement
[46:38] to remain faithful in every way if
[46:40] you're here today and if you're
[46:41] discouraged and if you feel alone or
[46:44] misunderstood by those around you may I
[46:46] remind you to take courage in my files
[46:50] there's the first handwritten note sent
[46:52] to me by brother Greene he thanks me for
[46:55] my ministry in Tucson and for stirring
[46:57] up within him the gifts that were
[46:58] present in his life he ended that note
[47:01] by saying brother Steve may I say that I
[47:05] love you son be strong I cannot express
[47:11] the deep meaning those words had for me
[47:13] then and again today
[47:15] when we are weak his strength is made
[47:19] perfect in us a man let's lean on our
[47:23] beloved today and find comfort I also
[47:27] want you to know if you had the
[47:31] opportunity to know the man that lived
[47:33] beneath that surface well it may be
[47:36] better described like this in Israel a
[47:39] native-born Israeli is referred to as a
[47:42] what do you know some of you know Sabra
[47:48] Sabra this term alludes to a tenacious
[47:51] thorny desert plant known in English and
[47:53] you'll know it too as prickly pear with
[47:58] a thick skin that conceals a sweet
[48:01] softer interior that cactus is compared
[48:06] to Israeli Jews who are supposedly tough
[48:09] on the outside but delicate and sweet on
[48:12] the inside for me maybe not for you for
[48:16] me this disc
[48:18] brother green and I told him so when we
[48:22] were in Israel and he laughed and said
[48:24] oh you think so do you
[48:30] brother green was faithful to the Lord
[48:32] faithful to the word how often he
[48:35] recalled to us the admonition that
[48:36] brother Branham gave to him keep your
[48:39] balance it was his desire to take this
[48:45] precious message and lay it in the
[48:49] scriptures it's powerful
[48:52] so that cows are not eating grass out of
[48:56] the tops of trees to let it fit the
[48:59] continuity of the word may be an honor
[49:02] of brother green it's time for some of
[49:05] us mostly me to trade in our personal
[49:09] interpretations of this truth and let
[49:12] God interpret it for us by bringing it
[49:15] to pass God is faithful so many have
[49:19] strayed from the simple gospel of Jesus
[49:21] Christ come back come back to your
[49:24] beginning come back to the original Word
[49:28] it is true that we each have to find our
[49:31] journey to Christ but it has to be on
[49:34] his terms and not in the terms that we
[49:38] set for ourselves our terms are more
[49:40] often based on our own wounds and our
[49:43] own fears but his terms are clearly
[49:46] outlined for us in the word this is a
[49:49] bloody way this is a costly way but
[49:52] thanks be to God the price has already
[49:55] been paid on our behalf if your redhot
[50:00] desire to serve God has grown cold you
[50:03] don't have to stay in that condition if
[50:05] you've slid backwards toward this world
[50:08] and it's a lures come home come home to
[50:12] Jesus today you have that opportunity
[50:16] amen if internet reports and carefully
[50:21] worded arguments have discouraged you
[50:23] from the passion you once had to follow
[50:25] in those footprints on the sands of time
[50:27] if you've been shaken because of detail
[50:31] has been misplaced in a sermon or a date
[50:34] was inaccurately quoted lay those things
[50:38] aside and come back to the original Word
[50:42] of God if you become reluctant to share
[50:48] the message with someone because you're
[50:51] nervous about what they might hear or
[50:53] read about brother Branham on the
[50:56] Internet
[50:58] take courage today let us follow in the
[51:03] legacy steps of brother Greene and many
[51:05] others like him let's continue to
[51:08] testify and share with anybody who will
[51:11] listen what the Lord has done in our
[51:15] lives
[51:16] and how he has revealed his word to us
[51:21] it is he only him who can open our eyes
[51:26] to see with eyesalve and give us ears to
[51:30] hear the overcomers message but don't
[51:33] you back off in sharing what you know to
[51:36] be the truth because of Scarecrow's that
[51:39] the enemy has raised up in this hour yes
[51:43] that was a little extra no matter what
[51:50] we do or even what we wear we cannot be
[51:53] holy enough not on our own on our best
[51:59] day all of our righteousness all the
[52:01] righteousness we can muster is still
[52:03] filthy rags in the sight of a holy and
[52:05] just God so we must yield to his
[52:08] righteousness until he fills us with so
[52:10] much of himself that we can reflect the
[52:13] attributes of Jesus but if the fads and
[52:17] fashions of this world have crept into
[52:19] your life and if you have compromised
[52:21] your stand for separation and holiness
[52:23] modesty and if for whatever reason
[52:26] you've returned to the places that
[52:28] you've been called out from and you find
[52:30] yourselves again in the lodges of
[52:32] Babylon hear the cry of God's word come
[52:37] out of her
[52:39] my people that you be not partakers of
[52:43] her sins and that you receive not of her
[52:46] plagues let's run back to the blood back
[52:48] to the word let's cling closer to Jesus
[52:51] than ever before and closer to one
[52:53] another because the resurrection is at
[52:55] hand I'm closing my remarks you don't
[53:00] believe me but it's true and I timed
[53:02] myself earlier I want to say that we are
[53:09] heirs to a fine legacy from the man who
[53:15] lived in this house one of faithfulness
[53:18] and stability of generosity and true
[53:20] fellowship but it is up to us how we
[53:24] steward this legacy will we squander it
[53:27] will it be wasted or will we utilize it
[53:30] will we see its true value and follow in
[53:33] these footsteps or will we put it off
[53:35] and choose to ignore it
[53:39] we sorrow
[53:42] we've wept but we've not shed one tear
[53:46] for brother green not one why would we
[53:49] why could we why what it wouldn't be
[53:51] possible every tear that we have shed
[53:54] has been for our selfish selves because
[53:58] we know that our lives as they were
[54:00] changed when he came into them will be
[54:03] somewhat changed as he makes his exit
[54:05] but all thanks be to God there will be
[54:08] another spring we know this is not the
[54:12] end it's just a temporary farewell
[54:15] factor brother green said to me I'll see
[54:17] you in November and then he left or no
[54:23] please I'm not making a doctrine
[54:28] but if it happens in November let it
[54:31] roll hallelujah I'm tired of this pest
[54:35] house it's alright to the home so this
[54:41] is not a farewell no sir no no not a sad
[54:45] goodbye it's more rightly expressed it's
[54:49] our precious brother until we meet again
[54:52] at Jesus feet in fact today could be a
[54:55] new beginning for some of us not an end
[54:57] if we refuse to sit around and reminisce
[54:59] only about what a good man he was or how
[55:02] much we loved him and actually take this
[55:04] inheritance pick up this legacy and go
[55:07] forward not talking about it living it
[55:11] demonstrating it I'm not gonna leave
[55:15] this part out even if I feel the
[55:17] pressure to do so I've received gifts
[55:20] from brother and sister green through
[55:21] the years um and I know caleb has too he
[55:24] just couldn't find them at that moment
[55:25] but the most valuable and priceless
[55:29] thing that brother green ever gave to me
[55:32] took place in a conference that brother
[55:35] green had been invited to speak at in
[55:37] Daphne same conference I mentioned I'm
[55:40] gonna toughen up and get through this
[55:42] part I read it to my wife and sobbed
[55:44] it was during another minister's service
[55:47] another minister was preaching and
[55:48] brother green was sitting next to me
[55:50] near the front of the auditorium and the
[55:51] speaker was speaking about father issues
[55:54] and he asked for everyone in the
[55:58] building who had experienced father
[56:00] issues to stand I honestly felt that I
[56:04] had thoroughly forgiven my earthly dad
[56:06] for his rejection of me but to be honest
[56:09] the thought came to my mind that so many
[56:11] of my own congregation were there and
[56:13] they would indeed know my story and
[56:15] perhaps they would wonder why did I
[56:18] think I was too good for a minute to be
[56:19] ministered to
[56:20] why wouldn't I respond to the call for
[56:22] prayer so I stood the minister began to
[56:25] pray and to my surprise my heart melted
[56:28] again in the presence of the Lord as I
[56:31] recalled the huge hole that had been
[56:33] left in my life by a dad who didn't want
[56:37] to be a part I also felt the touch of
[56:40] nagging fear
[56:41] that had crept in from time to time to
[56:44] announce to me that I would not be a
[56:46] good father because I had no
[56:49] relationship with my own father it
[56:52] became a precious time as I felt the
[56:54] Holy Ghost within reassuring me that I
[56:56] had a father a Heavenly Father who cared
[57:00] and loved me very very much and that he
[57:03] would help me to raise my sons and
[57:06] daughters brother green and I had only
[57:09] been recently reunited this was after
[57:13] our season of being apart in
[57:16] communication and so we hadn't had time
[57:20] to to speak about these things again the
[57:24] details of my personal life and I was
[57:26] truly startled as I was standing there
[57:29] tears running down my face quietly just
[57:31] thanking God for what he had done for me
[57:34] when brother green jumped up it scared
[57:38] me he did it so quickly he jumped up and
[57:42] I opened my eyes and tears I don't know
[57:48] if I'd ever seen brother green cry like
[57:49] this tears were running down his face I
[57:52] remember thinking wow what is this about
[57:56] but before I could even figure out what
[57:59] it was about he had wrapped me in the
[58:01] biggest bear hug of my life well as
[58:03] close as our bellies would let us get
[58:07] and I'll never forget his words almost
[58:12] too personal to share and a few that I
[58:15] will leave off Steve I'm so sorry that
[58:19] your father failed you when you really
[58:23] needed him and most of all I am sorry
[58:27] that when you needed me the most
[58:29] I failed you also I must have looked
[58:33] startled by what he said because he
[58:36] forcefully continued when you needed
[58:39] someone to help guide you and shape you
[58:41] and help you navigate the new world that
[58:43] you had been thrust into I failed you
[58:46] and I'm so sorry can you forgive me I
[58:51] wanted to answer him but all I could do
[58:55] is shake
[58:55] my head and sob louder son I love you
[58:59] tell me what can I do to prove to you
[59:01] that I'm sorry this was so unusual for
[59:06] me to see brother green in this state
[59:10] tell me what can I do
[59:13] all I could say at the moment was just
[59:15] keep loving me brother green he said
[59:17] that I can do and we both sat down we
[59:21] never talked about it again he committed
[59:24] to me later that evening to be there to
[59:25] assist in any way that I ever needed to
[59:27] do the work of the ministry etc skipping
[59:30] skipping skipping I want you to know I
[59:32] never carried a grudge against brother
[59:34] green I was not his personal
[59:35] responsibility but there was something
[59:39] so soothing and healing in his words to
[59:43] me I received them for my life but
[59:47] please hear me carefully but I also knew
[59:51] that in some strange way I was receiving
[59:54] them for many others who needed to hear
[59:57] those words those who felt as I had let
[1:00:01] down rejected by their own earthly
[1:00:04] father or let down by their mentors
[1:00:09] dropped like mephibosheth by someone who
[1:00:13] was supposed to protect and care for
[1:00:15] them I also sensed forgive me this
[1:00:18] moment I also sensed that I was not the
[1:00:22] only one that brother green was thinking
[1:00:24] about when he apologized to me that day
[1:00:27] perhaps he was also thinking of some of
[1:00:30] you in this very room and I say this so
[1:00:32] humbly God knows my heart perhaps he was
[1:00:35] also thinking of some of you in this
[1:00:37] very room some that may have counted on
[1:00:39] him in ways that he could not serve you
[1:00:42] or perhaps some that he did fail to do
[1:00:45] all that he could do for he was human
[1:00:50] and he was only one imperfect man in the
[1:00:53] hands of a sovereign and perfect God but
[1:00:56] if you are here and that could be your
[1:00:58] story as crazy as this sounds to some
[1:01:01] would you please allow me to say the
[1:01:04] words to you that he spoke to me that
[1:01:07] day I believe
[1:01:08] therefore all of us could you allow the
[1:01:10] Holy Ghost to come and heal you deliver
[1:01:14] you of any hurt wound rejection that
[1:01:19] you've carried in your life regardless
[1:01:21] of who it came from or how it was
[1:01:23] delivered would you allow the Lord to
[1:01:27] roll off of you the hurtful words that
[1:01:29] have been spoken to you or about you
[1:01:33] through your life whether by your
[1:01:35] earthly father or those who loved you
[1:01:37] but had issues of their own to work
[1:01:40] through would you allow me to call you
[1:01:42] by the spirit like King David called to
[1:01:45] mephibosheth son of his best friend
[1:01:49] Jonathan grandson of King Saul I'm doing
[1:01:51] that now even without your permission
[1:01:54] it's time for you to bring your crippled
[1:01:57] feet and come to the Kings table your
[1:02:02] handicaps your wounds your hurts will be
[1:02:04] covered under the protection of his
[1:02:07] table you'll eat the food of kings and
[1:02:11] no longer be an outcast in Israel rise
[1:02:15] up the King of Kings is calling to every
[1:02:18] mephibosheth everyone who has been
[1:02:20] dropped or failed or wounded or hurt in
[1:02:23] your life what brother Greene gave me
[1:02:26] that day was something similar to what a
[1:02:28] scripture what the scripture calls a
[1:02:30] father's blessing we read about it in
[1:02:33] the lives of the patriarchs of Israel a
[1:02:35] father would call his sons forward lay
[1:02:37] hands on their heads speak words of life
[1:02:39] and encouragement over them sometimes
[1:02:41] even prophesying their future and
[1:02:42] outlining their inheritance I'm not
[1:02:44] blood family
[1:02:46] - brother Greene and I have no rights or
[1:02:49] claims to an earthly inheritance however
[1:02:51] I would like to keep the cowboy boots
[1:02:53] that he gave me in June that fit like a
[1:02:58] glove and I would have wore them today
[1:03:00] if I would have had more courage but I
[1:03:02] was afraid because the heels were a
[1:03:03] little high that I would fall over
[1:03:04] backward while I was trying to speak but
[1:03:08] let me say that if you're not even if
[1:03:10] you're not blood relative of brother
[1:03:12] Greene we are all errors we're heirs
[1:03:16] we're heirs of a legacy paths footprints
[1:03:20] to follow in and even
[1:03:22] shoes to fill so what is the legacy of
[1:03:24] Perry green as I move toward my seat
[1:03:29] what is the legacy of Perry green I am
[1:03:32] you are and you and you and you and you
[1:03:37] and you and you we are if we keep our
[1:03:40] eyes on Calvary if we keep pressing
[1:03:43] toward Jesus Christ if we take our stand
[1:03:46] with a word then we will be the living
[1:03:49] legacy of this great man we're not
[1:03:54] finished here there's other things that
[1:03:55] will be done but I want to just pray as
[1:04:00] I leave I'm not even going to ask you to
[1:04:02] stand because I want them to be able to
[1:04:04] move in quickly and do what needs to be
[1:04:06] done I just want to pray I just feel so
[1:04:10] that it is so important that you let the
[1:04:13] Lord comfort you if you're hurting we
[1:04:18] grieve but not as those who have no hope
[1:04:20] I also think it is vitally important
[1:04:23] that we pick up this baton and run
[1:04:26] harder than we've ever run before
[1:04:29] because we're closer children than we've
[1:04:31] ever been and also feel like that it's
[1:04:34] time to be healed the word has come to
[1:04:37] deliver us and it's also come to heal us
[1:04:39] and if you're still bearing the marks of
[1:04:42] pain perdón projection let Jesus do
[1:04:45] something let him do it wouldn't
[1:04:47] wouldn't brother aye well you may not
[1:04:49] believe but I believe brother green
[1:04:50] would be extremely happy if you left
[1:04:52] here lighter then you came in so just
[1:04:56] bow your head just a moment father
[1:04:57] you're so good to us I've done what I
[1:05:02] was asked to do and III tried to follow
[1:05:06] the leading of your spirit I thank you
[1:05:09] that you helped me get through this I
[1:05:13] feel as any Minister would standing here
[1:05:17] the pull of your people because we are a
[1:05:21] needy people brother Branham often said
[1:05:24] it and we're as needy or more needy
[1:05:26] today then that generation was we need
[1:05:30] healing
[1:05:31] we need deliverance
[1:05:33] we need hope some of us have been
[1:05:37] wounded some of us have been failed and
[1:05:40] some of us carry roots of bitterness and
[1:05:42] seeds that we don't like and we need
[1:05:46] them extracted we need them taken out
[1:05:48] and we surrender right now to the work
[1:05:51] of the Holy Ghost come Jesus come
[1:05:53] precious Lord and heal us pour the
[1:05:56] healing balm of Gilead soothe us in this
[1:06:01] moment give us the grace Lord to receive
[1:06:05] your blessing I'm not a father to these
[1:06:09] men I'm considered young by some and old
[1:06:13] by others but I am a father
[1:06:16] you've given me four amazing children
[1:06:17] and I'm a pastor to a small congregation
[1:06:20] so Lord I want to just do what I feel to
[1:06:24] do and that is to release a blessing
[1:06:26] over this precious body of believers and
[1:06:29] we will receive that blessing as coming
[1:06:32] from your word and we'll call it in this
[1:06:35] moment of father's blessing the Lord
[1:06:37] bless thee and keep thee the Lord make
[1:06:40] his face to shine upon thee and be
[1:06:41] gracious unto you the Lord lift up his
[1:06:44] countenance upon you and give you peace
[1:06:47] Shalom Shalom
[1:06:52] [Applause]
