TRANSCRIPT
========================================
wow and Jesus began preaching to them but all of the while he's taking on the weight on the weight of this sinful world as he's going toward the cross he knows the end but he's still day by day laying down his will to in order to get to the finality of it the cross the execution stake the place swear that he would end all of your pain all of your suffering all of your shame all of your condemnation all of your guilt well brother I feel awful guilty today how how do you figure that he ended it all either you believe the word or you don't the devil does not really have authority in your life right he only has Authority by what I give him that's how he plays around in our lives that how that's how he gets us messed up in our mind that's how he causes us to build Abominations in our mind Idols in our mind we have agreed with him that our ground is still cursed we have agreed with him that we're still walking under a curse but the Lord Jesus came to reverse the curse those that are sons of God they agree with what has already been done the curse that has been reversed the curse has already been taken onto Christ he took the curse and the curse he took with him to hell yes sir yet we find ourselves agreeing with that curse friend you don't have to you don't have to agree with that curse and all I'm saying is what has already been said the words of our mouth were either blessing or cursing and the seed is not cursed and the ground doesn't have to be because Jesus Took The Curse to hell and left it there so we continue cultivating picking up rocks John said when he comes he's going to baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire that's what some of us need we need the fire of the Holy Ghost to come and burn some things out of us to burn burn all the underbrush but I've had some harvests along the way but I realize that I've not had the hundredfold Harvest that I really desire to have and so I need some of the Holy Ghost and Fire to come in my life and burn some things out of me that I did not know were in there I need some of the fire of God to burn out some of the tormenting spirits that have been inside of me I need the Holy Ghost in fire to burn some of the de Dem things out of my life that I've allowed to remain there and I kept pronouncing the curse over it and the curse remained and so I've had to live with the curse and live with the curse and live with the curse because I didn't agree with the reversing of the curse of Calvary when he took it to hell and I've had to deal with it but oh that the Holy Ghost and Fire would descend upon us and it'd come by the power of the Holy Ghost and burn out of us all of that stuff that hinders the growth of the seed
