[38:01] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; Night and day,
[38:06] &gt;&gt; the angels
[38:08] cry in holy.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; God gave us a voice.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[38:19] And that voice was not to spew
[38:22] slanders and gossip and garbage out of
[38:26] our mouth. But our mouth was created to
[38:29] give praise,
[38:31] &gt;&gt; adoration to the holy one, the king of
[38:34] glory.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; We cry, holy are you, oh Lord.

[38:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:48] G.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; What a privilege it is to serve the
[38:52] living God.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; Do you have a need as we're getting
[38:56] ready to pray today that you would just
[38:58] like to make known by the lifting of the
[39:00] hand all over the building out across
[39:03] the stream? The Lord sees the needs that
[39:06] you have. He knows what they are and he
[39:08] knows best how to take care of them.
[39:10] Yes,
[39:10] &gt;&gt; he does. Yes.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; I may not know the details,
[39:15] &gt;&gt; but my Lord does.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; He does.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; He was the one who fearfully and
[39:21] wonderfully created us
[39:24] &gt;&gt; and he knows all about us. He knows how
[39:27] to take care of us.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; Lord, we bless you.
[39:39] Can you just lift your hands into his
[39:41] presence?
[39:42] [Music]
[39:43] Brother Elum, will you come and lead us
[39:45] in prayer today?
[39:48] So, we just take a moment, another
[39:51] moment to worship the Lord, to give him
[39:54] the praise that he deserves.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; Coming into his presence with
[39:59] thanksgiving,
[40:02] &gt;&gt; thanking him for all of his wonderful
[40:04] works.
[40:06] Holy Lord.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; He's a God that likes memory.
[40:12] He likes us to remember what he already
[40:14] has done.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; But he doesn't want us to just live
[40:18] there.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; He wants us to bring it up to today that
[40:21] he is today as he was yesterday
[40:25] &gt;&gt; the same. And he will be the same
[40:28] tomorrow
[40:30] &gt;&gt; as he is today. Let's join our faith
[40:32] together as our brother leads us in
[40:33] prayer today. G.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; Dear us, Lord Jesus.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; Oh God, we come before you with humble
[40:43] hearts this morning.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; Lord, we just we want to give you
[40:48] praise, Lord, for all that you've done
[40:50] for us already, Lord.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; And for what you will do, Lord.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; As we go further,
[40:56] &gt;&gt; Lord, even this day, let your hand be
[40:59] here upon us. Yes.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Let it continue, Lord, as you already
[41:04] were here in our midst.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; We just pray for more, Lord.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; Your anointing to be so strong here
[41:10] today, Lord,
[41:12] &gt;&gt; that it changes us on the inside.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord, that our hearts can be drawn
[41:17] to you.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; To go deeper, Lord,
[41:21] &gt;&gt; Lord, to to
[41:23] &gt;&gt; Lord, where we need more cleansing.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; Cleanse us, Lord. do it,
[41:28] &gt;&gt; Lord. Where there's areas in our lives
[41:30] that have not been fully surrendered,
[41:33] &gt;&gt; we pray that today,
[41:35] &gt;&gt; you would help us, Lord,
[41:37] &gt;&gt; to just give it all,
[41:39] &gt;&gt; to just give it all to you and let you
[41:42] have your way in our hearts, Lord.
[41:45] And Lord, if there's areas we're unaware
[41:47] that we still need to change,
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Lord, we open those to you, too.
[41:54] Lord, as as that uh
[41:58] Lord, that one night when we were in
[42:00] prayer and I just
[42:02] saw you like going before us, Lord, and
[42:06] we come to this uh maybe a Y in the road
[42:10] and if we don't yield, we get before you
[42:14] and you want to go first, Lord. So, help
[42:16] us to just yield
[42:17] &gt;&gt; and come after you, Lord. Come behind
[42:19] you, Lord, and let you lead the way.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; You lead the way,
[42:23] &gt;&gt; Lord. We don't always know how it should
[42:25] be. So, we just ask that you help us to
[42:27] yield
[42:29] &gt;&gt; and let you go before us.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord, we thank you. We give
[42:33] you praise this morning for you are
[42:35] worthy.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; And Lord, I pray that you speak today
[42:40] &gt;&gt; through our brother.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; Lord, that you take control,
[42:44] &gt;&gt; that you have the preeminence in this
[42:46] place and that you reign
[42:50] and that you touch every heart. We give
[42:52] you all the glory in Jesus name.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; How we praise you Lord.
[43:01] [Applause]
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; You may have your seats today.
[43:17] I'm going to step out of the way and let
[43:18] them we're going to have the children
[43:21] come in just a moment to sing. We're
[43:23] real happy to have you in the house of
[43:25] the Lord today.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; The Lord is good. He's merciful and kind
[43:30] and we're thankful that he worked among
[43:33] us last night. But last night was last
[43:36] night. We rejoice in what happened last
[43:39] night. But we came again today because
[43:42] God is a God of today as he was
[43:45] yesterday. And he wants to minister and
[43:47] speak to us once again today.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; We're thankful that he still speaks.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; He is not a deaf mute.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; He has a voice and he can hear when we
[44:00] cry to him. And I want to be able to
[44:03] have ears to hear him when he speaks.
[44:06] And I'm thankful that he is still
[44:08] speaking. So Olivia, you want to bring
[44:10] the children and we'll let them get
[44:13] ready.
[44:15] F please.
[44:18] Once again, we welcome you into the
[44:20] house of the Lord.
[44:22] And today may be just a little bit
[44:25] different, but we've come to worship and
[44:27] magnify the Lord
[44:29] &gt;&gt; because he is good. He is always good.
[44:35] [Music]
[44:38] Well, I'm rejoicing night and day as I
[44:42] walk the pilgrim way for the hand of God
[44:45] in all my life I see.
[44:49] And the reason of my bliss. Yes. The
[44:52] secret all is this that the comforter
[44:56] abides with me.
[44:59] Oh, he abides.
[45:02] He abides.
[45:05] Hallelujah. He abides with me.
[45:09] Oh, I'm rejoicing night and day as I
[45:13] walk the milker way. For the comforter
[45:17] abides with me.
[45:20] Once my heart was full of sin. Once I
[45:24] had no peace within. Till I heard how
[45:27] Jesus died on the tree.
[45:31] Then I fell down at his feet and there
[45:34] came a peace so sweet. Now the comforter
[45:38] abides with me.
[45:41] Oh, he abides.
[45:44] He abides.
[45:47] Hallelujah. He abides with me.
[45:52] Oh, I'm rejoicing night and day as I
[45:55] walk the pilgrim way. For the comforter
[45:59] abides with me.

[56:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:19] Again, we're glad that you're with us
[56:21] this weekend. We would like to take a
[56:25] moment now to receive the tithe and
[56:27] offering giving as unto the Lord. He has
[56:29] blessed us. He is good uh to bless us
[56:34] with our substance and we gladly give
[56:36] back to him. Steven Yantis, can I call
[56:39] on you and Ian McFarland to go to the
[56:42] people as we are continuing to worship
[56:46] the Lord, preparing our heart for the
[56:48] preaching of the word. You know,
[56:51] we could say a lot of things,
[56:55] but the word of God endures forever.
[57:00] My words may fail, but his do not.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; And we are sure grateful to be in a
[57:06] place where the truth of the word of God
[57:08] is preached.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; We heard it last night, and I believe
[57:11] we're going to hear it again tonight,
[57:12] today, and we want to hear it as much as
[57:15] possible because it's what changes us
[57:18] from glory to glory. He's changing me.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you as you give to
[57:24] the Lord today. Father, I pray that you
[57:26] will bless the people as they give to
[57:29] you. May it be multiplied back into
[57:31] their homes. May the blessing of the
[57:33] Lord rest upon them and in their homes.
[57:36] Uh God, I thank you that you multiply
[57:38] what is given for the purposes of the
[57:41] kingdom. And it's in the lovely name of
[57:43] the Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Sing this old hymn with us as you're
[57:48] giving your tithe and offering today. Oh
[57:52] Lord my God,
[57:54] [Music]
[57:56] when I in all
[58:00] wonder
[58:03] consider
[58:05] all
[58:08] the world thy hands have made.
[58:16] I see the stars.
[58:21] I hear the rolling
[58:25] thunder.
[58:27] Thy power throughout
[58:33] the universe
[58:36] displays.
[58:41] and sings my soul,
[58:46] my Savior
[58:48] God to thee.
[58:54] How great thou are.
[58:59] [Music]
[59:01] How great thou are.
[59:08] and sings my soul,
[59:13] my Savior
[59:15] God to thee.
[59:18] [Music]
[59:21] How great thou art.
[59:28] How great thou art.
[59:35] When through the woods
[59:40] and forest
[59:42] glades I wonder
[59:47] and hear the birds
[59:52] sing sweetly
[59:55] in the trees.
[1:00:00] When I look down
[1:00:06] from lofty
[1:00:08] mountain
[1:00:10] grand
[1:00:13] and hear the brook
[1:00:18] and feel the gentle
[1:00:22] breeze.
[1:00:27] and sings my soul,
[1:00:32] my Savior
[1:00:34] God to thee.
[1:00:40] How great thou are.
[1:00:47] How great thou are.
[1:00:54] and sings my soul.
[1:00:59] [Music]
[1:01:05] [Music]
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; How great thou are.
[1:01:16] How great thou art. And when I think
[1:01:21] that God is so not sparing, and when I
[1:01:26] think
[1:01:29] that God is so not sparing,
[1:01:37] sent him to die.
[1:01:43] I scarce can take it.
[1:01:48] Think about what he did for you
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; that on the cross
[1:01:57] my burden
[1:01:59] gladly
[1:02:01] bury.
[1:02:04] He bled and died
[1:02:08] [Music]
[1:02:09] to take
[1:02:11] away
[1:02:13] my sin. Would you stand together with us
[1:02:16] if you can? Then sings my soul,
[1:02:23] my Savior
[1:02:25] God to thee.
[1:02:32] How great thou are.
[1:02:39] How great thou are.
[1:02:44] and light is
[1:02:48] my soul.
[1:02:50] [Music]
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, my soul sings to you. How great thou
[1:03:03] are,
[1:03:07] how great
[1:03:09] thou are.
[1:03:13] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[1:03:19] Give the Lord another praise.
[1:03:23] Hallelujah. He's worthy.
[1:03:29] Hallelujah.
[1:03:32] Isn't he worthy this morning?
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. He is wonderful and
[1:03:39] worthy to be praised.
[1:03:41] You you may wonder why we're up and down
[1:03:45] a lot. Uh but we do it because we want
[1:03:49] to show honor and respect to the
[1:03:51] creator.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; He's worthy.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; You know, you may not be British, but if
[1:03:59] the a and no matter how you feel about
[1:04:02] Charles,
[1:04:03] he's still the king,
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; not of this nation. But if he were to
[1:04:08] walk in this room, there would be many
[1:04:10] of us who would stand not to honor his
[1:04:13] character, but to honor his office.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; I was tested
[1:04:18] on that very point. I was in Washington
[1:04:20] with my wife some years ago and uh the
[1:04:25] prime minister of Israel, Benjamin
[1:04:26] Netanyahu, he came into the room, and
[1:04:29] I'm not Israeli, but I respect the
[1:04:32] office that he held then and that he
[1:04:34] still holds today. and I stood up.
[1:04:37] That's what you should do. It's just
[1:04:39] respect. If the King of Kings and the
[1:04:42] Lord of Lords was in the midst, you're
[1:04:44] not standing for a preacher.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; You're standing to give honor to the
[1:04:48] King of Kings, the Lord of Lords. Then
[1:04:51] the next day, the the uh current
[1:04:54] president of the United States, Barack
[1:04:56] Obama, he came into the room where we
[1:04:58] were, just a few feet from where we were
[1:05:00] standing. He was not a president that I
[1:05:03] particularly was fond of. had nothing to
[1:05:06] do with his race or his place of birth
[1:05:09] or any of the other controversial
[1:05:11] things. I did appreciate his stand for
[1:05:14] Israel, but he was just really making
[1:05:16] some poor decisions in my opinion. But I
[1:05:19] never hesitated, not even one second to
[1:05:22] stand up because it wasn't the man.
[1:05:25] Brother Brandham tells us, not the man.
[1:05:27] We're honoring the office that he holds.
[1:05:30] I tell you what a privilege to be able I
[1:05:33] I prayed with the musicians in the back
[1:05:36] this morning and I was overwhelmed with
[1:05:39] this thought. Thank you Lord. I woke up
[1:05:42] today in my right mind.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; I knew where I was.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; I knew who I was.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; When I began to see my family, I
[1:05:51] recognized them.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; I knew who they were to me. And I don't
[1:05:56] want to take that for granted because
[1:05:58] there's many people who woke up this
[1:06:00] morning and that was not their
[1:06:02] condition.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; God is good. He is faithful. He is
[1:06:06] gracious. He is worthy to be praised.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; If you believe that, would you say amen?
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Didn't the children do a wonderful job?
[1:06:15] my
[1:06:18] not only
[1:06:21] not only the the small ones, but the the
[1:06:25] young adults who came and sang
[1:06:28] afterwards. We we've called them the the
[1:06:31] younger young people,
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; but uh the reality is that the the old
[1:06:37] youth group is uh mostly married with
[1:06:40] children. So that isn't really the
[1:06:43] younger young people. I hate to tell you
[1:06:46] Ben and Zach and I hate to tell you that
[1:06:50] is the young people
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; but it it just changes you know
[1:06:59] uh we we are blessed because our babies
[1:07:02] have many of them have stayed with us
[1:07:04] and they have grown up and they have
[1:07:06] married somebody else's babies and they
[1:07:10] have had some babies and uh and have
[1:07:14] stayed. It's our idea of church growth.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; That's how we do it. God is good. He is
[1:07:20] faithful. We are thankful this morning.
[1:07:23] Very thankful.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Uh today among the Jewish community is
[1:07:28] tishav. It is the day that the Jewish
[1:07:31] people around the world remember the
[1:07:33] destruction of the temple which has some
[1:07:36] significance to us as well. And so we
[1:07:39] look at that. time in scripture. It's
[1:07:42] also the end of the season of the dire
[1:07:45] straits. Hallelujah.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; That squeezing time that is commemorated
[1:07:52] on the calendar every year and uh it's
[1:07:56] sometimes felt by intercessors and we're
[1:07:59] very thankful that it has once again
[1:08:01] come to an end. You have blessed us to
[1:08:04] be here this weekend. We appreciate your
[1:08:06] presence here and we want to invite you
[1:08:09] to our camp meeting in October of this
[1:08:12] year during the tabernacles time,
[1:08:15] October 7th through 12th. Now, somebody
[1:08:19] will text before bedtime and ask, "What
[1:08:23] were those dates again?" They're on the
[1:08:25] app. They're on the web page. And
[1:08:28] they're where you're writing them down
[1:08:30] right now
[1:08:32] or typing them in right now so that you
[1:08:35] don't miss October the 7th through the
[1:08:37] 12th. That's a Tuesday night to a Sunday
[1:08:40] morning. We'll be having food and
[1:08:42] fellowship in the evening after the
[1:08:44] service. And then on Friday night, there
[1:08:47] will not be a service here in the
[1:08:49] sanctuary, but we're going to have a
[1:08:51] banquet on Friday night, which is the
[1:08:54] 10th of October. And uh we're going to
[1:08:57] celebrate 35 years of ministry here at
[1:09:02] in at New Hope Revival Ministries and 50
[1:09:06] years of public ministry. So, you're
[1:09:08] going to want to be here because it's
[1:09:10] going to be a special time. There may be
[1:09:12] pictures,
[1:09:14] there may be mmentotos, and there may
[1:09:17] there may be bloopers.
[1:09:22] May maybe you're going to want to hear
[1:09:24] them, see them if there are. Can you
[1:09:27] imagine all the all the mistakes that
[1:09:30] have been made on camera
[1:09:34] in 50 years? I'm glad a lot of that uh
[1:09:37] uh is so tightly packed away that no one
[1:09:40] is getting to it. I know that for sure.
[1:09:42] I hold the key. How about that? That's
[1:09:44] good.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; But we want you to come and be with us.
[1:09:47] We believe that God is going to meet us
[1:09:49] in a very special way. Would you like
[1:09:51] some good news?
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Well, Jesus is Lord. That's good news.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; But there is other good news in our
[1:09:59] midst today.
[1:10:01] Uh Stephen and Lydia, would you all
[1:10:03] stand up and let everybody see you all?
[1:10:07] I'm sure you've noticed that they have
[1:10:09] migrated to the same pew this weekend.
[1:10:13] Giving you a hint. I'm pleased to
[1:10:15] announce that our sister Lydia and our
[1:10:19] brother Stephen are engaged to be
[1:10:21] married later this year. Let's
[1:10:23] congratulate them.
[1:10:33] [Music]
[1:10:36] We're very happy. We believe that God
[1:10:39] knows exactly what he's doing.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. So naysayers,
[1:10:47] push them out.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; You ought to believe in love.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; You say, "Why? Why? They're coming from
[1:10:56] two different communities." Yes, in many
[1:10:59] ways. But in many ways, they're coming
[1:11:01] from the very same family. That's right.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; The family of God,
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; the bloodbought,
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; the redeemed of the Lord,
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; and this is a relationship.
[1:11:14] These wonderful saints in Indiana,
[1:11:16] Brother Elum, you're representing them.
[1:11:19] Brother Amos representing them here
[1:11:21] today. They are not just uh fellow
[1:11:24] believers, but they're family to us.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; And the fellowship that God has given us
[1:11:30] these years has been absolutely a
[1:11:32] blessing.
[1:11:34] And uh we believe that this is spiritual
[1:11:38] and somewhat prophetic.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; And uh we sometimes have to get up above
[1:11:43] ourselves to discern the will of God.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to nod a little while
[1:11:51] while you register what I'm saying. So
[1:11:54] we give my mighty praise to God. This is
[1:11:57] a week of birthdays and I'm not going to
[1:11:59] take the time to commemorate the
[1:12:01] birthdays of those who have gone on. and
[1:12:03] I would normally uh try to do that but
[1:12:06] we have some saints that we continue to
[1:12:08] remember. Sister will mention her uh
[1:12:12] this week but uh among those who are
[1:12:15] worshiping with us Mary Bethl where is
[1:12:17] Mary Beth? Mary Beth has a birthday uh
[1:12:21] this week and she on Tuesday and I
[1:12:25] didn't I didn't write down any number so
[1:12:27] would you just say happy birthday to
[1:12:29] sister Mara.
[1:12:36] Sister Teresa, some of your children
[1:12:38] know that you were born on August the
[1:12:40] 6th. I doubt very many of them know what
[1:12:43] day of the week that is. I tested David.
[1:12:46] I said, "What day this week is your
[1:12:47] mother's birthday?" I
[1:12:51] born on the 6th. So, I warned him. It's
[1:12:54] Wednesday, so he has time to get the
[1:12:56] card and the cake and the balloons and
[1:12:58] the and and the thank yous and
[1:13:01] everything else. Would you all just say
[1:13:03] happy birthday to Sister Teresa?
[1:13:11] Let's stand for the reading of God's
[1:13:13] word today.
[1:13:15] I know we are just slightly perhaps
[1:13:18] distracted. There is a lot that goes on
[1:13:21] in moving this pull pit because there
[1:13:23] are wires that connect it to various
[1:13:26] things and we just have to make up our
[1:13:28] mind not to lose any momentum in the
[1:13:30] spirit.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; I need more in this monitor please. Uh
[1:13:34] we want to just keep moving toward what
[1:13:37] the Lord has for us today.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:13:44] For he is Lord.
[1:13:51] He
[1:13:53] is Lord.
[1:13:57] He has risen
[1:14:01] from the dead.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; He is Lord.
[1:14:10] Every knee, every knee
[1:14:15] shall
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; shall bow.
[1:14:19] Every
[1:14:20] tongue
[1:14:23] confess
[1:14:26] that
[1:14:28] Jesus
[1:14:31] Christ
[1:14:33] is
[1:14:35] Lord. You may not be able to sing this,
[1:14:37] but if you can, would you do it? He's my
[1:14:40] Lord. He's my Lord.
[1:14:45] I'm not changing songs.
[1:14:48] He my Lord.
[1:14:52] He has risen.
[1:14:55] He has risen
[1:14:59] from the dead.
[1:15:02] And he
[1:15:05] my Lord.
[1:15:09] Oh, every
[1:15:11] knee
[1:15:13] shallow
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; it will
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; every tongue
[1:15:21] confess
[1:15:24] that
[1:15:26] Jesus
[1:15:29] Christ
[1:15:31] is my
[1:15:33] Lord.
[1:15:36] Now sing this with with me. He's my
[1:15:40] Lord.
[1:15:45] There is
[1:15:47] no other
[1:15:49] one.
[1:15:53] Who
[1:15:54] can calm
[1:15:57] the storms of life
[1:16:00] like
[1:16:02] my Lord?
[1:16:05] Thank you Jesus.
[1:16:07] He
[1:16:09] give rest
[1:16:11] to the weary.
[1:16:15] Give new life
[1:16:18] to the hopeless.
[1:16:22] There's
[1:16:24] no doubt.
[1:16:27] No doubt about it.
[1:16:30] He's my Lord.
[1:16:33] One last time. Sing that with me. He's
[1:16:36] my Lord. He's my Lord.
[1:16:42] My Savior. There is
[1:16:46] no other
[1:16:48] one.
[1:16:51] Who
[1:16:53] can come
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; like my Lord?
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[1:17:04] Thank you Jesus. He give rest
[1:17:09] to the weary.
[1:17:13] Give new life
[1:17:16] to the hopeless.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; He's done that for some of us.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; There's no doubt, no doubt about it.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; He's mine.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. He is. He is. He's my Lord.
[1:17:36] Would you thank the musicians for their
[1:17:38] labor?
[1:17:41] Hallelujah. I appreciate all of you.
[1:17:46] Turn in your Bibles while you're
[1:17:48] standing to Psalm 27
[1:17:53] verse 5 and 6.
[1:17:57] We want to welcome all of you who are
[1:17:59] streaming the service across the nations
[1:18:02] of the world. I see the United Kingdom
[1:18:06] is represented largely this morning.
[1:18:10] We want to give thanks to God for South
[1:18:13] Africa, the Netherlands,
[1:18:16] many saints in Indiana, Uganda,
[1:18:19] more in Indiana, more in Indiana,
[1:18:23] Ghana, West Africa,
[1:18:26] it just goes on and on. God bless every
[1:18:29] Zambia. Wow.
[1:18:32] More from Cape Town.
[1:18:34] We just welcome every one of you. Thank
[1:18:36] you for being with us today. We
[1:18:39] appreciate it. Psalm 27.
[1:18:42] For in the time of trouble,
[1:18:46] he shall
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; hide me in his
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; pavilion. In the secret of his
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall
[1:19:01] set me up upon
[1:19:06] a rock.
[1:19:07] Hallelujah. A rock. And now shall mine
[1:19:12] head be lifted up above mine enemies
[1:19:15] round about me. Therefore will I offer
[1:19:19] in his tabernacle?
[1:19:23] What?
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Sacrifices of
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; I I didn't I didn't know you could
[1:19:32] sacrifice joy.
[1:19:35] I knew you could sacrifice praise,
[1:19:38] but how do you sacrifice
[1:19:41] joy?
[1:19:43] You cannot unless you're in his
[1:19:45] pavilion.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; He has a hiding place. And in his hiding
[1:19:50] place, joy is a part of who you are.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; So you offer whatever you offer, you do
[1:19:57] it in the joy of the Lord. Didn't the
[1:19:59] Bible say, "The joy of the Lord is mine.
[1:20:03] I will sing. Yay. I will sing praises
[1:20:08] unto the Lord. Father, we come to you in
[1:20:13] the mighty name of Jesus Christ. How we
[1:20:17] thank you for your wonderful presence in
[1:20:19] our midst. You have given us rest upon
[1:20:23] the bed last night and as mentioned, you
[1:20:26] woke us up in our right mind and we give
[1:20:29] you praise for that. You have met us
[1:20:32] again in the atmosphere of worship. And
[1:20:35] now as we approach the holy word of
[1:20:38] life, we ask that you would come and
[1:20:41] minister to us in a way that only you
[1:20:45] can. We take authority over every
[1:20:48] distracting spirit in the name of Jesus
[1:20:51] Christ. And we ask that you would pull
[1:20:53] our hearts and our minds together that
[1:20:56] you might speak to us. And that when we
[1:21:00] leave this place today for more
[1:21:02] fellowship and a meal among ourselves,
[1:21:05] may we leave here saying it was good to
[1:21:09] be in the presence of the Lord. We heard
[1:21:12] his voice and we know that he has spoken
[1:21:16] to us today. This is our desire. We ask
[1:21:19] for your help alone in the name above
[1:21:23] every name, the name of our Messiah, the
[1:21:25] Lord Jesus Christ. And the saints said,
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; let's let's do it again. And the saints
[1:21:32] said,
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; "Amen." You may be seated. As we
[1:21:36] mentioned to you last night,
[1:21:39] Psalm 27 is a very particularly special
[1:21:44] one of the Psalms
[1:21:46] in the rapture message in July, I
[1:21:51] believe, of uh 65
[1:21:54] when brother Brandham was preaching this
[1:21:58] one of the last public messages of his
[1:22:00] ministry and he titled it the rapture.
[1:22:05] As we were coming to a close last night,
[1:22:07] we mentioned that he mostly anybody
[1:22:10] referring to resurrection or rapture,
[1:22:13] they would use Corinthians. They would
[1:22:15] use Thessalonians.
[1:22:17] They would speak about Enoch being
[1:22:19] translated, Elijah being caught away in
[1:22:22] a chariot drawn by horses of fire. But
[1:22:25] the spirit of the Lord led this prophet
[1:22:29] to a particularly unusual place to
[1:22:33] preach one of his last messages on the
[1:22:36] earth to help us understand that the
[1:22:39] rapture is not just an event,
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; but it is a position.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; I want you to hear what the spirit of
[1:22:47] the Lord might want to say to you today.
[1:22:50] It's not just an event,
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; but it is a position.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; It is a place of rest in him.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; We hear uh many times, several times in
[1:23:03] the message, we we hear him indicating
[1:23:06] to us that the rapture is in
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; it's in progress.
[1:23:14] It's in process. it meaning that it's
[1:23:18] not just the twinkling of an eye, the
[1:23:21] batting of an eye, and we're out of
[1:23:23] here,
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; but there's a change that must take
[1:23:26] place in us
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; to be ready for that event.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; So, we want to see it not as just a
[1:23:35] twinkling of an eye moment, but we want
[1:23:38] to understand that the word rapture
[1:23:41] doesn't appear in English in our
[1:23:43] translated Bible. But the concept of
[1:23:47] being captured,
[1:23:49] snatched up, caught up is the meaning of
[1:23:53] the word rapture. And I want you to know
[1:23:56] there is a revelation that God has sent
[1:23:59] to his people in this hour that catches
[1:24:02] them up a little bit higher than what's
[1:24:05] going on around them.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; When we are sitting under the revealed
[1:24:09] word of God, we are physically seated
[1:24:13] together in the house. But spiritually,
[1:24:16] the Bible tells us we have been raised
[1:24:18] up together and we are sitting together,
[1:24:22] seated together in
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; in heavenly places.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; And where are those heavenly places
[1:24:30] found?
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; In
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; He in the anointed one.
[1:24:40] in the manifestation of God in flesh. We
[1:24:45] are caught up to a higher place.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; And when we're caught up higher, we have
[1:24:51] this unique ability to praise no matter
[1:24:55] what's going on.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; We become Paul's and Silases. Come on.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Not whipped and imprisoned in man's
[1:25:03] prison, but facing a lot of oppositions
[1:25:06] and a lot of persecutions and a lot of
[1:25:08] hardships in Satan's Eden where we are
[1:25:12] now living.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; But there's something about the
[1:25:15] revealing of Jesus Christ, his word
[1:25:19] becoming alive in his people
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; that for a few moments we are caught a
[1:25:24] little higher.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; We forget about the burdens. We forget
[1:25:29] about the bills that are due.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Some of us do.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; We forget about people troubles and how
[1:25:37] awkward a meal is going to be with
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Uncle
[1:25:43] Alfred or whatever his name is. We
[1:25:46] forget about all of the different
[1:25:48] complications
[1:25:50] of our past and for a few moments we
[1:25:54] find ourselves in a transcended place.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; It's another realm. The Bible clearly
[1:26:01] tells us it's another realm. It's
[1:26:03] another dimension. Physically, we're
[1:26:06] just right here together. But
[1:26:07] spiritually, we move up into another
[1:26:10] place and we begin to receive something.
[1:26:13] If you if you think that I'm talking
[1:26:15] about a feeling,
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about a feeling because
[1:26:19] feelings are fickle.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Feelings come and feelings go. We've got
[1:26:25] to find something more than an emotion.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; We've got to find something more than a
[1:26:30] feeling, a feel-good moment, a
[1:26:33] goosebumps on our arms, or whatever it
[1:26:35] is that you would use to describe a
[1:26:38] moment of pleasure, a moment of
[1:26:40] happiness, a moment of of feeling good.
[1:26:42] But it's more than that. It's an
[1:26:44] atmosphere where we can be changed. It's
[1:26:47] an atmosphere where our desires are
[1:26:50] finetuned and our priorities are
[1:26:53] rearranged as we come into a higher
[1:26:56] place of
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; of surrender.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask you all to turn turn it
[1:27:01] down now just a little bit in the
[1:27:03] monitor. I'm so sorry. We're having a
[1:27:05] hard time getting it just right. And uh
[1:27:09] I've turned it toward the wall because
[1:27:11] it's so loud
[1:27:13] and uh it it distracts just a little bit
[1:27:16] because I don't want to scream in such a
[1:27:18] way that you can't hear the words, but I
[1:27:21] don't want to put so much energy into it
[1:27:23] that I don't have a voice later uh to to
[1:27:27] say God bless you and to greet you. So
[1:27:29] uh forgive us for trying to get it just
[1:27:32] right. Oh, the Lord is good to help us,
[1:27:35] isn't he?
[1:27:36] Now when we start looking at Psalm 27 as
[1:27:41] a rapture scripture,
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; we understand that we are not just
[1:27:48] waiting on a rapture,
[1:27:50] but we are somehow exper experiencing
[1:27:56] rapture.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; It's a caught up. It's a catching up.
[1:28:01] It's an exaltation. It's being moved up
[1:28:03] a little bit higher. And I can say with
[1:28:06] all my heart, it's in progress.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; I've experienced it most recently, a
[1:28:12] moment of being just caught up into a
[1:28:15] place where you just would like to stay
[1:28:17] there all day long.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Never have to answer another text.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; Never have to check another Facebook
[1:28:26] status.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Never have to answer another phone call.
[1:28:29] Just let me stay right here in the
[1:28:32] presence of the Lord. Amen.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; So when we have that, we're having
[1:28:38] moments
[1:28:40] of rapture.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; I want you to say moments of rapture.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Moments of rapture.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; The reason why we're looking at it in
[1:28:46] such an elementary way is because after
[1:28:49] all these years, we're still programmed
[1:28:51] to think of it as some glorious morning
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; one day way out there. And it will be.
[1:29:01] There will be a culmination.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; There will be a consummation
[1:29:06] of the rapture.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; But there is a preparation because
[1:29:11] Christ is descending. It's an ing.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; It's an ing with his word.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; He is descending in his word.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; And according to the scripture, we're
[1:29:26] living under the voice
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; of the archangel. Amen.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; You need to understand that that's not
[1:29:35] just a prophet's voice,
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; but that is the voice of a prophetic
[1:29:40] people.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; God has sounded a message in a trumpet
[1:29:45] to gather his people together. And now
[1:29:49] that people are finding fellowship under
[1:29:53] the voice of a five-fold ministry all
[1:29:57] over the world.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; And it is our duty to echo what the
[1:30:01] trumpet has sounded. Yes.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; But it's also our duty to recognize the
[1:30:08] moving of the pillar of fire.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; The blowing of the spirit wind.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. to understand the times and the
[1:30:19] seasons of the Lord.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Now, don't you sit here this morning and
[1:30:24] even consider how somebody else is
[1:30:27] taking this.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; You see if you can take a piece of it
[1:30:32] for yourself.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; This is our hour. This is our day to
[1:30:37] catch what we can because we are changed
[1:30:40] by what we catch.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; I don't mean just like that. I mean in
[1:30:46] spirit
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; here we laid a little introduction last
[1:30:50] night. We've got United Pentecostal
[1:30:52] people here last night. Baptist people
[1:30:55] sitting right up here on the front. And
[1:30:57] notice we didn't change the message one
[1:31:00] ounce.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Can't do it.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Can't adjust it based on who's in the
[1:31:05] crowd.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Unless the spirit says, "I want to take
[1:31:08] you somewhere else."
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; It's important to stay with the
[1:31:12] assignment until the assignment is
[1:31:14] finished. And the assignment is for you.
[1:31:17] The assignment is for me. There is a
[1:31:19] secret place in his tent, in his
[1:31:24] tabernacle, in his pavilion,
[1:31:28] in his refuge. There is a place for us.
[1:31:32] This is Bible language.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; It's scripture language. There is a
[1:31:37] place for us in the canopy or the
[1:31:40] nuptual chamber.
[1:31:43] There's a place for us in the holy of
[1:31:45] holies.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; In the tent within the tent or the room
[1:31:49] within the room, there is a place for
[1:31:52] us.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; You are a tripartate man.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; You also have three dimensions inside of
[1:31:59] you. Amen. A body of flesh, a soul that
[1:32:03] is mind, will and emotion, and a spirit.
[1:32:07] You were spirit first like Adam. The
[1:32:11] breath of God blew over Adam, body
[1:32:14] first, then spirit,
[1:32:18] and then man became after the breath of
[1:32:21] God, he became what?
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; A living soul, mind, will, and emotions
[1:32:26] so that he could have contact with the
[1:32:29] environment around him.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, I know some people teach that
[1:32:34] a little bit different order, but we we
[1:32:36] we we won't even talk about that this
[1:32:39] morning. It's not important. I don't
[1:32:41] care what you call the inside of the
[1:32:43] inside. If you call it soul, that's
[1:32:45] fine. If you call it spirit, that's
[1:32:47] fine. But we need to understand how each
[1:32:49] part functions and how it relates to
[1:32:52] God.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; And your flesh is never going to tell
[1:32:55] you to come to church and serve the
[1:32:57] Lord. This body is never going to do
[1:32:59] that. It's always going to want five
[1:33:00] more minutes. Come on now.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Just five more minutes, honey.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Turn off the alarm. Just five more
[1:33:08] minutes. It's just the way we are.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; It's the way our flesh is. And then your
[1:33:13] soul's going to kick in. They won't miss
[1:33:14] me.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; They won't even know I'm not there.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; They don't even hardly shake my hand
[1:33:21] anyway.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; So why do I get out of this bed? And
[1:33:25] then there's something on the inside
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; that says, "I'm not going there for the
[1:33:31] preacher.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; I'm not going there to hear the singing.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; I'm not going there to have my face on
[1:33:37] the stream. I'm going there because my
[1:33:41] creator is calling me to have fellowship
[1:33:45] with him like he had fellowship with
[1:33:48] Adam in the garden in the cool of the
[1:33:50] day,
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; in the cool of the evening. When the
[1:33:53] when the busyiness of the day was coming
[1:33:56] to an end, the creator came and walked.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; That's rapture.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? That's rapture.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; It's fellowship with the divine.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Now, one day, again, don't
[1:34:12] misunderstand, there's going to be a
[1:34:14] culmination. The dead in Christ shall
[1:34:16] rise
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; first. We which are alive and remain
[1:34:18] will be changed.
[1:34:20] We'll be caught up together to meet the
[1:34:22] Lord in the air.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. They don't prevent us. We don't
[1:34:26] prevent them. They don't get there
[1:34:28] before we do if we're alive. We We
[1:34:31] arrive in the heavenlies at the same
[1:34:33] time before the King.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; But I don't have to wait until the end
[1:34:39] of the age
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; to stand in his presence.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; I don't have to wait until the end of
[1:34:44] the age to experience a rapture.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when brother Brandon was
[1:34:49] going to leave the bride with a message
[1:34:52] concerning the rapture, he spoke about
[1:34:55] not a body change,
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; but he chose a text that talks about a
[1:35:02] position.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; A place in the secret of his
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Would you put that back up and let us
[1:35:12] see? In the secret of his tabernacle
[1:35:15] shall he
[1:35:18] How many of you want to be hidden
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; in him?
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; He will lift me up
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; above
[1:35:28] mine enemies,
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; my my burdens,
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; my worries.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; I will find myself in his pavilion.
[1:35:41] I'll go around my house and I'll start
[1:35:44] singing praises to the Lord.
[1:35:46] Not because I don't have a care in the
[1:35:48] world,
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; but because I know what happens when I
[1:35:53] begin to mention him.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; When I begin to focus on him, he lifts
[1:35:58] us.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; He wants to set you on a rock and give
[1:36:02] you a song. Hallelujah. How many of you
[1:36:05] need a rock?
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; We're making some progress now. How many
[1:36:09] of you need a rock?
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; How many of you want a song on the rock?
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; I want a song.
[1:36:15] Come on.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't know where it came
[1:36:18] from except from down within. Paul and
[1:36:21] Silas had no reason to sing.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Beaten and jailed, wounds bleeding. And
[1:36:28] yet in the midnight hour, hallelujah.
[1:36:33] The body said, "I don't feel like
[1:36:34] praising the Lord." The soul said, "I I
[1:36:37] I expect the church is having supper
[1:36:40] about now.
[1:36:43] mind, will, and emotions. And yeah, they
[1:36:46] probably don't even care that we're over
[1:36:48] here suffering in the for the king, for
[1:36:51] the Lord. We're suffering. They're
[1:36:52] feasting while we're fasting.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; They may not even know that's not the
[1:36:56] truth. They were being prayed for.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; The saints were praying for them.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, the body said, "I've
[1:37:04] never felt pain like this." The soul
[1:37:06] said, "Nobody even knows that we're not
[1:37:08] in the prayer meeting tonight.
[1:37:10] But something on the inside of the
[1:37:13] inside of the inside
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; said, "Soul, you better hush. Body, you
[1:37:18] better bow. There's something that tells
[1:37:21] me that we have a reason and a right to
[1:37:25] give praise to our creator. For he is
[1:37:28] not only our creator, but he is our
[1:37:31] deliverer."
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; And in the midnight, they sang praises
[1:37:35] to God. And what happened?
[1:37:39] Elvis wasn't anywhere to be found, but
[1:37:41] the jailhouse began to rock.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; The Bible said it began to rock
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; as the power of God began to fall.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; And what was a dire and desperate moment
[1:37:58] became an evangelistic service because
[1:38:00] Paul and Silas experienced a moment in
[1:38:04] the tabernacle. They experienced a
[1:38:06] moment under the tent. They experienced
[1:38:09] a moment in the hiding place with
[1:38:12] sacrifices of joy. They began to sing
[1:38:16] unto the Lord. They found themselves on
[1:38:18] the rock of ages. Hallelujah. With a
[1:38:21] song in their mouth.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; And God gave them deliverance.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; There's a bride.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; There's a bride.
[1:38:31] She's going to find that very same
[1:38:34] rapture moment.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; You may find it before you go home
[1:38:38] today.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because every time you get
[1:38:41] caught up above your stuff,
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; then biblically, you've had a moment of
[1:38:48] rapture. You've had a moment of ecstasy.
[1:38:52] You've had a moment that just takes you
[1:38:54] up a little bit higher.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; I used to hear them preach you, no one
[1:38:57] has ever been changed by a feeling.
[1:39:00] That's exactly right. The feeling is
[1:39:02] only a byproduct of an experience that
[1:39:05] has taken place. Don't ever let anybody,
[1:39:08] I don't care how many theologians come
[1:39:10] your way, don't ever let anybody talk
[1:39:13] you out of having your own personal
[1:39:15] experience with a living God.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Having an experience
[1:39:20] doesn't amount to anything. It may not
[1:39:22] for you,
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; but it made a change in me. 7 years old
[1:39:28] when he reached down, filled me with the
[1:39:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost and changed
[1:39:32] what I would have thought was the
[1:39:34] trajectory of my whole life. He did it.
[1:39:37] It was a moment of meeting. It was a
[1:39:39] moment of rapture. It was a moment in
[1:39:42] his tabernacle in his pavilion. He moved
[1:39:45] me from the holy place to the holiest of
[1:39:48] holies
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; for just a moment,
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; for just a season. And it changed
[1:39:54] everything.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Anybody with me?
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; So, I'm not surprised at all that
[1:40:00] Brother Brandham chose Psalm 27. I think
[1:40:03] you and I ought to read the whole Psalm.
[1:40:05] I think we ought to ask the Lord to make
[1:40:07] it real to us. Maybe we ought to read it
[1:40:09] often. I mentioned last night that the
[1:40:12] Jews read it uh every day for 30 days
[1:40:16] leading up to the feast of trumpets. And
[1:40:18] that period of time is referred to as
[1:40:21] the wedding of the Messiah. And so even
[1:40:24] in Judaism, the wedding of the Messiah
[1:40:27] is not a one-time event.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; It's a process.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; It's a it's a moed. It's an appointment.
[1:40:35] It's a meeting with the Lord. But it
[1:40:37] doesn't happen in one moment and then
[1:40:39] finished.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; In fact, it repeats itself every year.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Interesting.
[1:40:46] Every year there is a commemoration
[1:40:49] of the wedding between Messiah
[1:40:52] and his wife, his bride,
[1:40:56] which we know was originally the Hebrew
[1:40:59] people, the nation of Israel.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; But we understand that under the new
[1:41:04] covenant, there is neither a Jew or a
[1:41:07] Gentile. Isn't that New Testament?
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; He has now made us what? one new man.
[1:41:15] Hallelujah.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Romans tells us that the middle wall of
[1:41:19] partition has been torn down and that we
[1:41:23] are now partakers of the same promises
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; and the same covenant.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; What if you got a revelation that you
[1:41:32] could have a moment in the promised land
[1:41:34] before you land in the promised land?
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; The Israelis did. The Hebrews did. What
[1:41:42] do you think that was? When God came
[1:41:44] down on the mountain and chauffars
[1:41:47] blasted and thunder sounded and
[1:41:49] lightning flashed and God was talking
[1:41:52] with his prophet.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; It was a moment of meeting.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; It was a moment of ecstasy. It was a
[1:41:58] moment of rapture. We could say it's not
[1:42:01] stretching it.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; It's a divine appointment with God.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; We need that.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; We need more of them. We need maximum
[1:42:11] effect.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; We don't need to be in a hurry.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; We need to wait on him and in his
[1:42:19] presence. Lord have mercy.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; We want to be under those wings.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; How many of you believe that there's
[1:42:29] glory
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; under the wings of the cherubim?
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Underneath the wings of the cherubam.
[1:42:35] remember when God caught, if you read
[1:42:38] it, I mentioned it last night. I didn't
[1:42:40] put it in the notes for today, but I
[1:42:42] mentioned the sermon of Stephen. And
[1:42:44] he's preaching to these Jews who have
[1:42:47] rejected the Lord. And he's preaching to
[1:42:50] them about the the the pattern of the
[1:42:53] tabernacle that was given to Moses in
[1:42:56] heavenly places. He didn't receive that
[1:42:59] pattern on earth.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; He received it in a moment of rapture.
[1:43:05] in a moment of ecstasy.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; He was caught up into a place like John
[1:43:12] was on the day of the Lord.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; I was in the spirit
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; on the Lord's day.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; Moses saw a pattern.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; God brought him back. It wasn't the
[1:43:26] final rapture for Moses. It was a moment
[1:43:29] of rapture. He comes back with a pattern
[1:43:32] and that pattern is executed.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; God raises up people who will hear the
[1:43:39] vision, who will receive the pattern,
[1:43:42] and who will say to that prophet, "We'll
[1:43:45] make it be so."
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; So it is written.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; So it be done.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; I can't help it. Every time I say that,
[1:43:58] it reminds me of Mr. web
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; who came down here and everybody else
[1:44:02] said, "It'll never be.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; You'll never be able to build anything
[1:44:06] down there and and they just went and
[1:44:09] came and gone. Just goodbye then. God
[1:44:11] bless you." But here come Mr. Web, an
[1:44:14] Assembly of God man.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; And I described it to him. He said,
[1:44:18] "Where'd you get an idea like that?" I
[1:44:19] said, "It came by vision."
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; How did you know it had to be here?
[1:44:23] Because it came by a vision. Right?
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; He just stretched himself a little bit
[1:44:28] and he said, "Well, I'll tell you right
[1:44:29] now, if the preacher can see it,
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; We can build it.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Shouldn't this be our attitude of
[1:44:38] faith?"
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If God sent a prophet who
[1:44:43] said there'd be a people in the last
[1:44:45] days who would experience a thunder
[1:44:48] revival just before they leave,
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; then why wouldn't we believe it?
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; I said if a prophet can see it, I want
[1:44:59] to lend myself to the vision.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; I want to position myself to be a part
[1:45:07] just a part. Amen.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; I don't have to be a big part.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; I'm probably going to be a loud part,
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; but I don't have to be a big part.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Just let me be a part.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Brand, I'm many years off the
[1:45:20] scene. But let me say, if you can see
[1:45:22] it, sir,
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; I can lend myself to the vision.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Now, I won't need an airplane to do it.
[1:45:31] I won't need a tent
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; in mothballs
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; to do it.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; I won't need a one-man resurrection.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; To do it.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no.
[1:45:46] I tell you, he settled that for me when
[1:45:48] he simply said, "If Jesus Christ were to
[1:45:51] come here tonight and walk down that
[1:45:53] aisle, he couldn't do anything more for
[1:45:55] you tonight
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; than what he's already done."
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; You know, that ought to make you shout
[1:46:03] your shoes right off your feet.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Because what that simply means is it's
[1:46:07] finished.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; No wonder we sing, "It's already done."
[1:46:12] Amen.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; Because by faith,
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; it's a finished work.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; The vision has been seen
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; and we're leaning into it
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; and positioning ourselves.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; Many people have lived the rest of their
[1:46:29] life a generation ago,
[1:46:33] passed off the scene believing
[1:46:37] casual words that were spoken to them. I
[1:46:41] believe you'll be there. I believe
[1:46:43] you'll be there. Brother Brandon was
[1:46:45] known to say that to several. I believe
[1:46:46] you'll be there. While you'll drive the
[1:46:49] truck,
[1:46:51] why while you may be the front man just
[1:46:54] giving people these little assignments,
[1:46:56] he was doing that based on what he knew
[1:46:58] about them.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; He knew they were faithful.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; He knew they would stick with the word
[1:47:05] till the end.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; And he's just celebrating them in that
[1:47:08] moment. He wasn't prophesying. You see,
[1:47:12] every word that comes out of a prophet's
[1:47:14] mouth is not thus sayaith the Lord.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; Every word Moses said wasn't thus
[1:47:21] sayaith the Lord.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; It's a good thing
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; because God had to use his woman. God
[1:47:28] had to use his wife
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; to correct him.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Well, I wouldn't want to be found
[1:47:34] correcting the prophet. Well, God used
[1:47:37] Moses wife.
[1:47:41] Come on.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; You've been a bloody husband to me.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; You knew circumcision was God's seal of
[1:47:47] covenant.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; And we got so busy that we didn't take
[1:47:50] time to keep our covenant with God. And
[1:47:52] now look at the curse that's come
[1:47:54] because of you.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; A lot of people had to have some pain
[1:48:02] that day
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; and God used a woman.
[1:48:07] Amen.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Not a woman to preach a gospel,
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; but a woman to shake her husband.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; We got to get back to being right.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; Because we were once right is not enough
[1:48:22] to make a rapture.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; We got to be right now. Because we once
[1:48:26] had oil in our lamp, it's not enough.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; We've got to have oil in our lamp now.
[1:48:33] Because our wick was once trimmed, it's
[1:48:36] not enough. We've got to have a trimmed
[1:48:38] wick now.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Because we wiped the globe years ago and
[1:48:44] cleaned up the smut. That's good. But we
[1:48:47] can't let that be all there was to our
[1:48:50] experience.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; We've got to clean the globe today.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; We've got to wipe the lens today. Come
[1:48:56] on. We've got to believe that God is
[1:48:58] still a God who keeps every promise.
[1:49:02] who cannot fail.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; He cannot fail.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; Third seal. The bride hasn't had a
[1:49:10] revival yet.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; Then there's got to be something.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Two phases went by me today. I gave you
[1:49:24] what I But that third
[1:49:27] got to come.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; It's all got to come. Somebody said,
[1:49:32] "What would make you think you can get
[1:49:34] to be a part of it?" Because I was on
[1:49:36] his mind before the foundation of the
[1:49:39] world. No other generation was
[1:49:42] positioned to receive this final move of
[1:49:44] God than this generation. Last
[1:49:47] generation and the generation before
[1:49:50] were not positioned to receive it
[1:49:53] because they did not see the decrease.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Preach. That's right.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; Somebody's got to see Elijah go.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Somebody's got to recognize John the
[1:50:06] Baptist becoming smaller.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; So that he
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; simple.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Psalm 31:20, "Thou shalt hide them in
[1:50:20] the secret of thy presence from the
[1:50:22] pride of man." Oh yes. Many people get
[1:50:26] locked outside the pavilion because of
[1:50:29] pride, because of offense,
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; because of an unrecognized offense that
[1:50:35] you've picked up from somebody else. You
[1:50:37] carry the influence of somebody else's
[1:50:39] disagreement or beef.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Gossip has triangulated you and pulled
[1:50:45] you right in and and you don't even
[1:50:48] understand why you don't. I just don't
[1:50:50] like them.
[1:50:55] My mama used to say she had sharp for
[1:50:58] years sharp discernment.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; I just don't like them.
[1:51:04] I said, "Well, mama, that's no reason to
[1:51:06] mistreat them." I didn't say nothing
[1:51:07] about mistreating them. I said, "Mama,
[1:51:10] God said we got to love them." I didn't
[1:51:11] say nothing about not loving them. I
[1:51:14] love them, but I don't particularly like
[1:51:17] them. And I said, "You know, that can
[1:51:20] change one day." She said, "Absolutely."
[1:51:22] And that's what I'm hoping for.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; That it'll change one day.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; It was their ways.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; Did you know you can love somebody, you
[1:51:31] don't have to love everything about
[1:51:33] their ways,
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; but you love them? And you've got to
[1:51:36] believe that the same God who is
[1:51:38] preparing preparing a tabernacle who's
[1:51:42] stretching his tent
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; for for you is stretching his tent for
[1:51:48] them.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:52] Oh, won't that be a day when God swings
[1:51:55] all of these divisions
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; and he takes a piece of that one and a
[1:52:00] piece of that one and a handful of those
[1:52:02] and a handful of those and pulls them
[1:52:04] all all right under the same stretch
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; sits them on a rock and puts a song in
[1:52:10] their mouth and they begin to rejoice in
[1:52:12] what God has done not only in a day gone
[1:52:15] by but in their days. Amen.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; You must not just share a testimony of
[1:52:21] what God was. You need a testimony of
[1:52:23] what God is.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; He's an ontime God.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; He's an updated God. Jesus Christ the
[1:52:31] same yesterday,
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; today, and forever.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Put 31:20. Thou shalt hide them in the
[1:52:37] secret of thy presence from the pride of
[1:52:39] man. Thou shalt keep them secretly in a
[1:52:41] pavilion. Oh,
[1:52:44] from the strife of tongues.
[1:52:47] [Music]
[1:52:50] As long as you be you stay aware of what
[1:52:53] people say or what they think
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; or what they expect.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; And that just kind of drives you. You'll
[1:53:02] never get under the tent.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; You'll never find yourself in the
[1:53:06] pavilion or the tabernacle. You'll have
[1:53:08] to get to a place where it's you and
[1:53:09] him. Lord, you see what's in me that's
[1:53:12] not like you.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; I know others see it, too,
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; but they can't do anything about it but
[1:53:18] ostracize and misunderstand and wag
[1:53:21] their tongue. But if I can get locked in
[1:53:23] here with you for a little while,
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; you put your loving finger on what's
[1:53:27] wrong with me
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; and you release oil
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; and wine.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; Oil and wine to heal my wound
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; to remove the scar.
[1:53:43] Joshua, our Joshua
[1:53:46] was in Jerusalem.
[1:53:49] He comes down the stone stairs of our
[1:53:52] apartment and somehow maybe I don't know
[1:53:56] what all he's doing, playing. I can
[1:53:58] guarantee you that. I know that you
[1:54:01] parents think you're the only one who
[1:54:03] has raised
[1:54:05] children with energy.
[1:54:07] I almost said wild, but I want to be
[1:54:10] nice. But you're not the only one. We
[1:54:13] did, too. A lot of folks in this house
[1:54:16] did too. And we saw some of the same
[1:54:20] things you saw. Maybe the only
[1:54:22] difference is we didn't take our eyes
[1:54:24] off of them.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; When they had an accident, we were
[1:54:30] usually watching or somebody else was
[1:54:32] watching because we didn't leave them
[1:54:35] alone to the elements.
[1:54:37] We understood that we have a
[1:54:39] responsibility as stewards
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; to try to keep them alive
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; so they can grow up and be what God
[1:54:45] called him to be.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; Are you getting my drift?
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; I hope so. Anyway, he slices his chin.
[1:54:53] Was it here somewhere, honey? Lip below.
[1:54:55] Right below the lip though, wasn't it?
[1:54:57] Right there. Slid it open all the way
[1:55:00] through. Tooth went through it.
[1:55:03] We're in a foreign land. We rushed
[1:55:06] around. We did all kinds of things.
[1:55:09] Story too long to tell. Most of you have
[1:55:11] heard it anyway. God arranged things. He
[1:55:14] just does. Well, why didn't he just stop
[1:55:16] it? Well, I guess he's sovereign God and
[1:55:19] he can, but I wouldn't have had a
[1:55:21] testimony.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; See, I I I like the testimony that comes
[1:55:26] after the test.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; But he arrests in the parking garage.
[1:55:32] two of the leading pediatric
[1:55:34] pediatrician or young uh children's
[1:55:38] plastic surgeons. They're having a
[1:55:41] conversation in the parking garage and
[1:55:43] should have been gone a long time ago
[1:55:48] and they're telling us in the in the
[1:55:50] second hospital we went to, you're we're
[1:55:53] just going to be able to stitch it up.
[1:55:54] We're not going to be able to do
[1:55:55] anything about scarring or anything
[1:55:57] because the plastic surgeons are off
[1:55:59] their uh their shift and and it won't be
[1:56:01] in and and this we can't leave it open
[1:56:03] like this. What they didn't know what
[1:56:06] God had arrested.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; He had arrested them. They're having
[1:56:11] this long conversation. They tell us
[1:56:13] later the the the man tells us later
[1:56:17] that he lingered and he and and and was
[1:56:20] concerned and wondering why I'm
[1:56:22] lingering like this. I need to be home.
[1:56:25] I'm exhausted.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; But God arrested them
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; and they they looked at the situation
[1:56:31] and they took care of it. And one of the
[1:56:33] things that we were told was, "Use oil.
[1:56:38] Once the wound is healed,
[1:56:41] use oil.
[1:56:43] Doesn't matter. It could be even olive
[1:56:45] oil or vitamin E oil. Whatever you can
[1:56:48] get, even cooking oil. and and just rub
[1:56:52] it once it's healed. Just keep rubbing
[1:56:54] it. And when scar tissue is forming,
[1:56:57] little hard places, get under that le uh
[1:57:00] squeeze them
[1:57:03] hard
[1:57:04] and keep rubbing them with oil and
[1:57:07] there'll be no scar.
[1:57:09] And you know what? That's exactly how it
[1:57:11] happened. God knows exactly what to give
[1:57:15] you for your wound. And he knows exactly
[1:57:18] what to give you for your scar. He can
[1:57:22] take care of every bit of it if you can
[1:57:24] find a time, a place, a position with
[1:57:28] him.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; He just stretches his word over us.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; The Bible says underneath are the
[1:57:35] everlasting arms. That's when he c
[1:57:37] that's when he lifts us up.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; He comes up under us like that. The
[1:57:42] Bible talks about the uh the the eagle
[1:57:45] and and how that that eagle draws the
[1:57:48] the the little eaglet up under itself.
[1:57:51] It does it by by uh moving those five
[1:57:55] primary feathers on the end of his
[1:57:57] wings, creating a centrifugal force that
[1:58:00] sucks those little eigllets right up
[1:58:02] close under mama's breast or under
[1:58:05] daddy's chest. Don't you know that the
[1:58:08] creator
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; if he puts that kind of an ability in a
[1:58:13] noble animal or bird? Don't you know he
[1:58:16] has the creative power to put that kind
[1:58:19] of a relation to create that kind of a
[1:58:22] relationship with you to pull you up
[1:58:24] under himself
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; to cover you with his feathers? The
[1:58:28] psalmist said,
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; somebody said, "These are there's so
[1:58:32] many different metaphors and
[1:58:35] allegorories. I can hardly get them all
[1:58:37] straight." Well, I want you to know that
[1:58:39] just about all of them
[1:58:41] are the same concept.
[1:58:45] pavilion,
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; tabernacle,
[1:58:48] sanctuary, holy of holies,
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; chambers,
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; tent, hoopa,
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; almost all of it is about being covered,
[1:58:59] protected.
[1:59:01] It's not only about events leading up
[1:59:05] here or there, a moment here, a moment
[1:59:07] there, but it's about a culmination.
[1:59:11] It's about a change of ministry.
[1:59:14] One that brother Brandham didn't live to
[1:59:17] see the final installment of that of
[1:59:21] that new ministry that he looked for
[1:59:25] where it would be a private thing,
[1:59:28] not a public thing.
[1:59:31] The way he saw it and tried to interpret
[1:59:34] it in his own mind,
[1:59:36] I'll show you. I'll show you before we
[1:59:38] leave, but I'll have to hurry if I get
[1:59:39] to it. where he said, "Maybe the next
[1:59:43] time we'll put up that tent and that
[1:59:45] little place and we'll pray for the
[1:59:48] people in private."
[1:59:51] Because what he saw was that little
[1:59:54] place where they were going in and
[1:59:57] coming out entirely changed, completely
[2:00:00] healed in a new form.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; And so in his mind, he thought, "Well,
[2:00:06] now that's the way it'll be. We'll we'll
[2:00:08] take the prayer line off the platform
[2:00:11] and we'll put it into a little tent. Can
[2:00:13] you imagine what kind of uh uh press
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; that would have caused?
[2:00:21] Can you imagine the misunderstanding
[2:00:23] that that would have caused if it would
[2:00:25] have seen the natural fulfillment that
[2:00:27] he was expecting?
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; This healer, they called him taking them
[2:00:33] back in private. Only only two people
[2:00:35] know what's going on in there.
[2:00:38] He even said we'll bring two two women
[2:00:40] if it's a woman. He he he had this
[2:00:42] little program and it never happened
[2:00:44] that way.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; He even refers to a little moment of
[2:00:49] trying it.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; Somewhere
[2:00:53] behind the curtain of a theater where he
[2:00:56] was and it never was quite what he was
[2:01:01] expecting.
[2:01:02] We ought to know by now that a vision or
[2:01:06] a dream like the book of the revelation
[2:01:09] comes in symbols
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; and they can only be understood by
[2:01:15] revelation
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; and for some reason God didn't give
[2:01:19] brother Brandham the full understanding
[2:01:21] and he kept trying right up until the
[2:01:23] end to look forward to that new ministry
[2:01:26] and now there are many around this
[2:01:29] movement who have tried to make sure
[2:01:32] that we don't think it failed.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; And so they've come up with things to
[2:01:38] kind of describe, well maybe that was
[2:01:39] the new minister. Well, maybe that was a
[2:01:41] new All I know is he left the scene
[2:01:44] saying,
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; "Maybe next time."
[2:01:48] So for us to interpret things after the
[2:01:51] fact, it makes us a little bit brassy.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; For us to try to go back and say it was
[2:01:59] fulfilled and and even he didn't know
[2:02:02] it,
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; that would make us a little brassy.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; So all we can do is say, Lord, it's in
[2:02:09] your hands. You gave the vision. I lean
[2:02:13] myself. I lend myself to that vision. I
[2:02:17] still believe that there's change coming
[2:02:19] like that. And so there must be some
[2:02:22] installment of that in the day and hour
[2:02:25] that I'm living in. Even though he is
[2:02:28] long gone, God is the same. God keeps
[2:02:31] his word. He's not obligated to my
[2:02:34] interpretation or your interpretation
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; or a prophet's interpretation, but he is
[2:02:40] obligated
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; to his word.
[2:02:47] So, I don't think they're going to need
[2:02:48] the airplane.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; I have pictures if you want to see it.
[2:02:58] It once belonged to Lady Bird Johnson.
[2:03:02] Anybody know who Lady Bird Johnson was?
[2:03:06] Nobody. Nobody under 40.
[2:03:11] She loved wild flowers.
[2:03:14] She was the the wife of President Lyndon
[2:03:17] B. Johnson
[2:03:19] and the jet plane that she was tra
[2:03:22] traveled around in was bought many years
[2:03:25] ago by believers who are are holding it.
[2:03:29] And now the owners are mostly dead and
[2:03:32] it sits deserted on a field in Arizona
[2:03:36] waiting on a prophet to rise and fly it
[2:03:40] from place to place to have that new
[2:03:43] ministry
[2:03:45] to have that tent meeting that he was
[2:03:47] always looking for. And yet when brother
[2:03:50] Brandon was talking about rapture, he
[2:03:53] gives us Psalm 27,
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; a pavilion,
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; a tabernacle,
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; a secret place in him, a position,
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; not transportation,
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; not not some physical something,
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; some spiritual something. Would you
[2:04:15] really believe that the rapture is a is
[2:04:17] a natural?
[2:04:19] Or would you believe it's a
[2:04:20] supernatural?
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; What God does is supernatural?
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; He's a supernatural God. That's why
[2:04:28] people can't figure it out on their own.
[2:04:30] That's what frustrates the brainiacs.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; It frustrates the brainiacs because
[2:04:35] they're not able to really figure God
[2:04:37] out. He designed it that way
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; because it takes faith to access the
[2:04:42] reality of who God is.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; You've got to have some faith. You've
[2:04:46] got to place some faith there. And in
[2:04:48] order to do that, you've got to
[2:04:49] surrender some control. And that's the
[2:04:52] problem. Men don't want to lose control.
[2:04:54] Women don't want to lose control. But
[2:04:57] faith will take you to a dimension where
[2:05:00] you're no longer in complete control.
[2:05:03] &gt;&gt; You recognize the sovereignty of a God
[2:05:06] who directs.
[2:05:09] Sir,
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; are you still here?
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; I believe you are. I want us to move on
[2:05:14] just a moment. Uh I want us to go back
[2:05:17] uh to No, before we do, look at look at
[2:05:19] Isaiah 26:20.
[2:05:22] Come, my people.
[2:05:24] I hear it. Come my people,
[2:05:28] enter thou in.
[2:05:34] Enter thou into thy chambers, thy
[2:05:38] chambers,
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; a and shut thy doors about thee.
[2:05:45] Hide thyself as it were for a little
[2:05:48] moment
[2:05:51] until the indignation
[2:05:54] be overpassed.
[2:05:56] Doesn't Isaiah sound strikingly like the
[2:05:59] psalm?
[2:06:02] The same word is used in Song of
[2:06:04] Songs:4. We looked at it last night.
[2:06:06] Draw me. We will run after thee. The
[2:06:08] King hath brought me into his chambers.
[2:06:12] We will be glad and rejoice. That word
[2:06:14] chambers. Can you show us that? It's a
[2:06:17] masculine noun referring to a chamber, a
[2:06:19] parlor, a room, an inner room, a room of
[2:06:21] lying down or sleeping room. Innermost
[2:06:24] parts. Room within a room. Building
[2:06:28] within a building.
[2:06:30] The word means a compartment or room
[2:06:32] within a building which affords
[2:06:35] privacy.
[2:06:38] Solomon start draw me. He's writing but
[2:06:42] the bride is the one doing the talking
[2:06:44] here. Draw me.
[2:06:47] We will run after thee. It's Christ like
[2:06:51] a magnet.
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; It's our bridegroom like a magnet.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; Draw me. Yes, Lord.
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; How many of you have ever felt a draw?
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; Has anybody ever felt a pull?
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; Until you do, you'll never be able to
[2:07:07] acknowledge the reality of a savior.
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; I pray that if you've never felt that
[2:07:13] before, I pray you'll feel it
[2:07:14] unexpectedly,
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; maybe even now,
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; because that's just how sovereign he is.
[2:07:21] Amen.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; We understand that no man has ever just
[2:07:25] made up his head one day, I'm going to
[2:07:27] seek God.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; It's never happened.
[2:07:32] It cannot happen
[2:07:35] unless God first
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; is drawing.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "No man cometh to the father
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; except my spirit draw him."
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? That you're only
[2:07:47] seeking after God. How many of you would
[2:07:49] say, "I'm seeking the Lord in this
[2:07:50] hour." I'd say, "I am."
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; Do you know why you are?
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; Because he's seeking you.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; He's not trying to make you a fanatic.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; He's trying to make you a wife.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; I want you to know the concubine doesn't
[2:08:08] have the authority that the wife does.
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; The street walker doesn't have the
[2:08:14] authority that the wife does.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; You understand? Her name on the check.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; His Mrs. Jesus Christ.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; She's become one with him in the spirit
[2:08:27] by the word through a revelation.
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; He now resides. His spirit, his life,
[2:08:33] his love, his attributes now reside in
[2:08:37] her.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; Can you see that? Look at Psalm 195,
[2:08:43] which is as a bridegroom
[2:08:46] coming out of
[2:08:49] his chamber.
[2:08:52] A moment ago, it's their chamber.
[2:08:55] Now it's his chamber. And rejoicth as a
[2:09:01] strong man
[2:09:04] to run a race.
[2:09:07] Here is a bridegroom
[2:09:09] that has just left the moment. Now, I'm
[2:09:11] going to say this with King James
[2:09:15] language
[2:09:17] so that no parent has serious questions
[2:09:20] asked of them before lunch.
[2:09:24] You're not baby prepared for that today.
[2:09:28] Today's needs to be a chill day, right?
[2:09:31] Not a birds and bees day.
[2:09:34] So, we'll use King James
[2:09:37] The the bridegroom has just left the
[2:09:39] moment
[2:09:41] of consummation.
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; I promise you, he doesn't leave the
[2:09:48] chamber, the nuptual chamber, the
[2:09:51] consummation chamber
[2:09:54] as a wimp.
[2:09:59] &gt;&gt; Are you afraid to agree?
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; Are you blushing?
[2:10:05] Am I blushing?
[2:10:08] I guarantee you not.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; He is not a brokeback horse that day.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; He's a stallion.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong with that.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; He comes out with strength.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; He comes out recognizing that a seal has
[2:10:27] taken place.
[2:10:31] It's actually so holy
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; that this world doesn't deserve it.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; It's so clean
[2:10:41] and so holy and so spiritual and so
[2:10:46] beautiful that this old rotten world
[2:10:48] doesn't even deserve it.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; But it's nonetheless it is the way.
[2:10:55] It is procreation.
[2:10:58] It is multiply.
[2:11:00] It is everything that the scripture said
[2:11:02] it would be. But but this is a moment of
[2:11:04] a seal.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; Just just follow me just a minute. I
[2:11:11] won't get deep.
[2:11:13] I won't get embarrassing.
[2:11:16] Two destinies
[2:11:19] have come together and they begin to
[2:11:22] weave into one destiny. Amen.
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; Two ideas, two thoughts,
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; two upbringings,
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; one raised in a heavy-handed
[2:11:36] family
[2:11:38] and one raised in a maybe new age
[2:11:45] uh gentle par. Thank you.
[2:11:50] Lazy parenting.
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:55] Come on now.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; And yet they've come together and they
[2:11:58] can't afford to spend the rest of their
[2:12:00] life arguing about how it's done.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; It's a holy moment.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; It's a holy union. And and the
[2:12:09] bridegroom when he comes out of that
[2:12:11] chamber,
[2:12:13] she knows what there is to know about
[2:12:17] him.
[2:12:19] And he knows what there is to know about
[2:12:23] her. Right?
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; There was nothing to separate them.
[2:12:28] There was no veil to separate them.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; They weren't hiding from one another.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; It wasn't hidden underneath clothes
[2:12:40] because consummation doesn't happen that
[2:12:42] way.
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; I'll be careful.
[2:12:47] It's a holy thing.
[2:12:49] It's so holy that the only reason why we
[2:12:53] have this marriage concept and this
[2:12:56] consummation
[2:12:58] uh concept is because it that's not
[2:13:01] listen folks that's not the reality.
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; That's the type.
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; The reality is one with him. Amen.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; The reality is before the foundations of
[2:13:15] this world, God desired to have
[2:13:18] fellowship.
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; He desired to have intimacy, not
[2:13:25] sexuality, intimacy
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; with a people.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; He desired, can you imagine? He desired
[2:13:34] a counterpart.
[2:13:38] Come on.
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; How unbelievable.
[2:13:43] How unbelievable that the creator of all
[2:13:46] that we know would long to have
[2:13:49] fellowship with a counterpart when he
[2:13:52] dwelt alone
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; with his thoughts.
[2:13:57] Elohim
[2:13:59] not a multiple of personality, not a
[2:14:02] multiple of person, but a multiple of
[2:14:05] attributes. Elohim. He dwelt alone with
[2:14:08] his thoughts. And one of those thoughts
[2:14:11] and some of those attributes are
[2:14:12] represented in this meeting.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; I'm looking at them. Are you with me?
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; I'm looking at them.
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; He longed to have fellowship. The whole
[2:14:25] reason why Eve was taken from Adam, it's
[2:14:28] a part. Look. Look, folks. That wasn't
[2:14:29] the reality. That was the type.
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; That wasn't the reality. That was the
[2:14:34] shadow. That wasn't the antitype. That
[2:14:36] was the type.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; The the the reality was there was a a
[2:14:41] bride in Christ
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; from before the foundation of the world.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; She was in him as an attribute like Eve
[2:14:49] was inside of Adam
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; called he them
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; both in the same body. He separated a
[2:15:00] bride not by ri. This is metaphor.
[2:15:05] Some people will come along and say,
[2:15:07] "Well, didn't you know the man has one
[2:15:08] less rib than a woman?" Are you kidding
[2:15:10] me?
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; Are you kidding me?
[2:15:16] It's It was way more than just bone.
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; It was a part a feminine part, a
[2:15:24] feminist part of who he was.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; He longed to have fellowship. and what
[2:15:31] he was looking for was in him.
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; While he's looking around to find it,
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; Adam sees the animals with a mate,
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; he has no mate.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; The reason why Adam had to come to this
[2:15:46] reality is because the creator had
[2:15:49] already come to the same reality.
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; I have no mate.
[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; I have no wife. I have no bride. I have
[2:15:58] no counterpart. I fellowship in my own
[2:16:01] attributes and thoughts. He longed. I
[2:16:05] tell you folks, if you can get a glimpse
[2:16:07] of this greatest, it's the greatest
[2:16:09] romance.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; There is no story like this story. You
[2:16:14] can't believe it with head knowledge.
[2:16:16] You can only access it with faith.
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; But he found a way. He found a way. And
[2:16:22] it was an overnight way. It wasn't an
[2:16:23] instant way. It wasn't a microwavable
[2:16:25] way. It was a way that would take 6,000
[2:16:28] years. and eventually seven church ages
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; to even begin to execute it on planet
[2:16:35] earth.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; First, he wasn't even a god
[2:16:40] [Music]
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; because there was nothing to worship him
[2:16:44] as such.
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; So, he had to create a heavenly host
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; that would worship him.
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; Were they forced to do so? Evidently
[2:16:54] not,
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; right? because a portion of them
[2:16:57] rebelled and followed Lucifer.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; So they must have also had an
[2:17:00] opportunity to decide for themselves
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; and you do too.
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; Ex's just one little caveat
[2:17:09] and that is he knew your choice
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; before you were ever formed in your
[2:17:13] mother's womb.
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; He already knew your choice. Brother
[2:17:18] Brandon was preaching about Calvary that
[2:17:20] day at Calvary
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; and he talks about God reaching in and
[2:17:24] separating from Christ, the bridegroom,
[2:17:26] pulling the bride out. Same kind of same
[2:17:30] kind of typology that we saw over there.
[2:17:33] It wasn't about Adam.
[2:17:36] It wasn't even originally about Christ.
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; It was about creator.
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was about what came forth from
[2:17:43] the log go
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; desiring to have fellowship.
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; Did he desire worship? He did.
[2:17:54] But there was something he desired more
[2:17:56] than worship.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; Fellow. Someone say it with me.
[2:18:01] Fellowship.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; Fellowship.
[2:18:04] That's not two fellows in a ship.
[2:18:08] It's intimate
[2:18:10] one- on-one
[2:18:12] relationship. It doesn't replace your
[2:18:15] earthly wife.
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; It supersedes her.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; A man that doesn't have relationship and
[2:18:25] fellowship with his creator can never be
[2:18:30] enough
[2:18:33] &gt;&gt; for his wife.
[2:18:35] a woman who doesn't have fellowship with
[2:18:38] her creator. There there there doesn't
[2:18:40] have to be any jealousy. If there's
[2:18:42] jealousy in your home
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; over time that your husband spends with
[2:18:47] God or your wife spends with God or if
[2:18:49] they or or one of the other spends in
[2:18:51] church or around the things of the
[2:18:53] spirit, if there's jealousy involved in
[2:18:55] that, it's simply because somebody is
[2:18:59] not fellowshipping with their creator.
[2:19:02] Because once you understand the beauty
[2:19:06] that comes out for you
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; when your wife is madly in love
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; with her creator.
[2:19:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, nothing could ever replace you. She
[2:19:18] married you. She chose you. She took a
[2:19:21] vow with you.
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; But she will love you more.
[2:19:26] She will be able to be what you have
[2:19:28] need of if she stays in union and in
[2:19:33] communion with her creator.
[2:19:38] &gt;&gt; And it's more than fellowship twice a
[2:19:40] week at church.
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; That's only a type.
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; It's another shadow
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; of what has to take place when you pray,
[2:19:49] when you worship, when you sit down to
[2:19:51] read your Bible. You've got to remember
[2:19:54] it's more than words on a page. This is
[2:19:56] the written record of of a God who
[2:19:58] created and loved it. It's just the
[2:20:01] written record of his word. There's a
[2:20:02] living word.
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; That is the written record of the living
[2:20:07] word. But the living word lives in the
[2:20:09] people.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; It's the life of God. It's the life of
[2:20:12] Christ. It's eternal life. The apostle
[2:20:15] said, "The life I now live is not my own
[2:20:18] life."
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; I once lived my life. That's right.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; I wish you could help me.
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; Uh, we'll give you a good lunch if
[2:20:28] you'll stay a few more minutes.
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; Uh,
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; it's it's it's a it's a life that
[2:20:34] supersedes
[2:20:36] because this one comes to an end.
[2:20:39] And all your folks who love you, who see
[2:20:42] you once in a while,
[2:20:44] sometimes remember to send you a card or
[2:20:47] bake you a pie, and sometimes they
[2:20:49] don't. They'll all gather
[2:20:52] and they'll boohoo and they'll moan and
[2:20:54] they'll groan and they'll and they'll
[2:20:56] reminisce
[2:21:00] at your demise.
[2:21:03] There's more.
[2:21:06] I'm telling you, there's more. Yes, sir.
[2:21:09] The agnostic can't see it because it has
[2:21:12] to be accessed by faith. Faith is the
[2:21:15] substance of things hoped for and the
[2:21:17] evidence of things not seen.
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; You say, "I have no faith." You're a
[2:21:20] liar.
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible said, "Look, I'm going
[2:21:24] to believe God's word every time over
[2:21:26] you. You're mighty convincing, but I'm
[2:21:27] going to believe what God's word said."
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; God's word said to every man is given a
[2:21:31] measure, the measure of faith. It's
[2:21:34] there. It's just a seed. It's just a
[2:21:37] small little germ, but it's there
[2:21:38] somewhere. There's faith in you. You
[2:21:40] wouldn't be walking around if God hadn't
[2:21:42] placed it somewhere way down. Maybe you
[2:21:45] have to find it in your big toe,
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; but there's some faith there.
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; And you just have to get in an
[2:21:51] atmosphere
[2:21:56] &gt;&gt; where it can come alive
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; underneath your toenail or wherever it
[2:22:00] resides
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; and begin to spin around on the inside
[2:22:04] of you. and you say, "Well, maybe I
[2:22:05] maybe I could believe. May maybe I could
[2:22:07] put a little hope beyond this this
[2:22:09] thing. May maybe maybe there is a little
[2:22:11] more beyond this life."
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. There is an
[2:22:15] eternity. There was an eternity before
[2:22:18] there was a time.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; There will cease to be a time, but there
[2:22:22] will never cease to be an eternity.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; And the fellowship that God is longing
[2:22:27] for can only be executed in measure on
[2:22:31] this earth. But beyond this veil, beyond
[2:22:34] this curtain of time,
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; there's an eternity at peace with him,
[2:22:39] in fellowship with him. We're not all
[2:22:42] laying on our backs.
[2:22:44] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:22:45] &gt;&gt; Like some kind of goat yoga style or
[2:22:47] something, you know? It's not soul sleep
[2:22:50] we're talking about.
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; It's an eternity that's more vibrant,
[2:22:55] more real
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; than the one we're living in now. And
[2:22:59] God wants you to experience that in
[2:23:02] moments of rapture,
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; in moments of tabernacle, in moments
[2:23:06] under the pavilion, in moments sitting
[2:23:08] up on a rock.
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; So if the one on the end of your row
[2:23:12] gets more excited than you, get out of
[2:23:13] their way.
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; Don't criticize them. Get out of their
[2:23:17] way. They may be having one of those
[2:23:19] moments.
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Yeah, they may be just
[2:23:23] showing out. Don't you worry.
[2:23:27] Don't you worry about somebody else
[2:23:29] showing out.
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; God's got a number. He's got it.
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; He knows how to bring us down. He knows
[2:23:35] how. He know if you're putting on, God
[2:23:38] knows how to expose you.
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; If you get your eyes on somebody because
[2:23:43] you think they're putting on, you'll
[2:23:44] miss your moment of rapture. You'll miss
[2:23:47] your moment under the tabernacle. You'll
[2:23:50] miss your moment hiding in the rock.
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; Your eyes on him. your eyes on the word.
[2:23:56] Don't get your eyes on Are we still
[2:23:58] here?
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; It's 119.
[2:24:02] I need another minute or two.
[2:24:05] This this uh Psalm 195, it's actually
[2:24:07] the word hoopa.
[2:24:10] Hoopa. It's a breath. It's breath. It's
[2:24:13] more more than a German h. It's breath.
[2:24:19] You see, if you should take the there
[2:24:22] there there are no vowels
[2:24:24] in the sacred name of God. So, we know
[2:24:27] even as brother Brandham said, Jehovah
[2:24:29] is not right.
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; You do know he said that, don't you?
[2:24:33] &gt;&gt; He used it all the time because it was
[2:24:35] what he had to use. But he says right
[2:24:37] away, it it it's not right. There's no J
[2:24:40] in the Hebrew language and there were no
[2:24:42] vowels in the name of God.
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; It's represented by four Hebrew letters.
[2:24:46] Y vave
[2:24:49] and that's not how it's pronounced.
[2:24:50] That's the names of the letters.
[2:24:53] That's not how it's pronounced because
[2:24:56] there are no vowels there. It really has
[2:24:59] little sound.
[2:25:04] That's why the Jewish people call it the
[2:25:06] unpronouncable name of God.
[2:25:09] And so they call him things like Adoni,
[2:25:12] which is really a word that means Lord.
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; Or you will find among the Jewish
[2:25:19] community, they use this madeup word,
[2:25:23] Hashem,
[2:25:26] which means the name.
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; When they're referring to God, they say
[2:25:30] Hashem, the name. But I want you to know
[2:25:33] he has a name.
[2:25:36] Amen.
[2:25:37] &gt;&gt; His Old Testament name is barely
[2:25:39] pronouncable
[2:25:41] because no vowels were revealed in the
[2:25:43] name when the when the name was revealed
[2:25:45] to uh uh in scripture it was not
[2:25:48] revealed with vowels. So it would really
[2:25:49] just be like releasing air.
[2:25:57] Interesting.
[2:25:59] When we say it, we try to say Yahweh
[2:26:01] Jehovah Yave. We we find some way.
[2:26:04] Hashim, Adoni, Lord. We find some way.
[2:26:08] But the reality is the name is so holy
[2:26:11] and so sacred
[2:26:13] &gt;&gt; that it's the first thing you said
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; when you were born.
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; The sacred holy name
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; of your creator. The first breath of air
[2:26:29] that you breathe,
[2:26:33] &gt;&gt; didn't know it,
[2:26:36] not aware of it. You didn't do it as a
[2:26:40] worshshiper.
[2:26:41] &gt;&gt; You did it as a fingerprint of God's
[2:26:43] creation.
[2:26:44] &gt;&gt; You acknowledged him before you ever
[2:26:46] said mama, before you ever said da.
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; By the breath.
[2:26:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There lay this body of
[2:26:58] [Applause]
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; There lay this body of flesh, just
[2:27:04] flesh.
[2:27:07] God himself, it's a breathed breath into
[2:27:11] the nostrils of man.
[2:27:15] &gt;&gt; I don't think that's just symbolic
[2:27:16] metaphor.
[2:27:19] I think it's mouth-to-mouth
[2:27:20] resuscitation.
[2:27:22] I think it's God face to face with his
[2:27:25] creation, Adam.
[2:27:29] &gt;&gt; And all he does is breathe his name.
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; And the Bible said, "Adam became a
[2:27:37] living soul."
[2:27:39] &gt;&gt; He now had contact with his environment
[2:27:42] and with his creator.
[2:27:45] Praise the Lord.
[2:27:48] And so did you. Right?
[2:27:51] &gt;&gt; There is a place of intimacy and oneness
[2:27:54] with him that church will take you far
[2:27:57] away from
[2:28:00] because it come becomes religion and it
[2:28:04] becomes jumping through the hoops.
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; And there are people right here among us
[2:28:09] that we love dearly right in our own
[2:28:10] church who are still in that stage of
[2:28:13] their relationship with God. And we have
[2:28:16] to respect that and love people no
[2:28:17] matter where they are on the scale. But
[2:28:20] there are still some people who believe
[2:28:21] that you have to reproach approach him
[2:28:24] in some religious form or fashion
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; because they don't understand yet how he
[2:28:30] longs.
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; I I I like being with my wife.
[2:28:40] not looking
[2:28:43] always deeply in her eyes,
[2:28:46] but I like being where she is.
[2:28:49] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:28:51] &gt;&gt; The first thing that I rearranged in my
[2:28:54] message experience was when I first came
[2:28:58] around the message, I wasn't married and
[2:29:00] I I watched how people couldn't wait to
[2:29:02] get to the steakhouse so the men could
[2:29:05] go to one table
[2:29:07] and the women could go to another table.
[2:29:10] The men are going to debate the word
[2:29:14] and the women are going to talk about
[2:29:18] purses
[2:29:21] and never the twain shall meet. I told
[2:29:24] my wife at the beginning, I didn't
[2:29:26] choose a wife to sit with a bunch of
[2:29:28] stinking men.
[2:29:32] &gt;&gt; So, we're going to buck the trend.
[2:29:35] There will be a time that brothers will
[2:29:37] be together and sisters will be together
[2:29:38] and that's beautiful. And that's
[2:29:39] precious and that's wonderful. There'll
[2:29:41] be times when my wife is serving uh uh
[2:29:44] like like here and and and I'm sitting
[2:29:47] there waiting on her to come. But
[2:29:49] there's just something about I like
[2:29:51] being with her. If you could catch a re
[2:29:53] if you could catch even the smallest
[2:29:54] glimpse
[2:29:56] &gt;&gt; that he wants to have time.
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; It's not always about whether you
[2:30:01] understand everything that's said. It's
[2:30:03] just getting in his presence,
[2:30:06] &gt;&gt; being where he is. and having some
[2:30:10] fellowship with him.
[2:30:12] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:30:14] &gt;&gt; All right. Isaiah 45:5 and 6. Let's get
[2:30:16] it out and hurry. And the Lord will
[2:30:18] create upon every dwelling place of
[2:30:21] Mount Zion, and upon her assemblies a
[2:30:24] cloud and smoke by day, and the shining
[2:30:27] of a flaming fire by night. For upon all
[2:30:30] the glory for upon all the glory shall
[2:30:35] be a
[2:30:41] defense.
[2:30:43] What did Psalm 27 say? In the time of
[2:30:47] trouble, he shall hide me
[2:30:50] &gt;&gt; in the pavilion, in the secret of his
[2:30:52] tabernacle. The glory shall be a
[2:30:55] defense.
[2:30:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:30:57] &gt;&gt; And there shall be a tabernacle for a
[2:30:59] shadow in the daytime from the heat, and
[2:31:03] for a place of refuge, and for a covert
[2:31:08] Anybody with me? I'm hurrying. This is
[2:31:10] me in hurry.
[2:31:12] &gt;&gt; You need to slip out. You know you can.
[2:31:14] I won't throw a stone. I understand.
[2:31:18] I wouldn't want to listen to anybody
[2:31:20] this long either, perhaps.
[2:31:22] I'm sorry about that.
[2:31:25] There shall be a tabernacle for a shadow
[2:31:27] in the daytime from the heat and for a
[2:31:29] place of refuge and for a covert
[2:31:33] from storm and from rain.
[2:31:36] Now, we've got to figure out when that
[2:31:38] is.
[2:31:40] Some people say it's only in the
[2:31:42] millennium,
[2:31:43] but the scripture says there will be
[2:31:45] those
[2:31:47] who catch a foretaste
[2:31:49] &gt;&gt; of the powers of the age to come.
[2:31:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:52] &gt;&gt; That means there will be a people who
[2:31:54] experience millennial
[2:31:58] glory
[2:32:00] in the closing hours of the church age.
[2:32:02] Amazing.
[2:32:06] &gt;&gt; You mean I get a little taste of the
[2:32:08] millennium
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; on this side of the millennium? That's
[2:32:12] exactly what the New Testament tells us.
[2:32:15] &gt;&gt; They're tasting the powers of the age to
[2:32:18] come.
[2:32:19] &gt;&gt; I tell you, little bride, I have.
[2:32:23] Some of you have had moments
[2:32:28] where his presence became so real that
[2:32:31] it was realer than than your reality.
[2:32:36] &gt;&gt; And you don't want to strut around the
[2:32:37] room like a rooster
[2:32:39] &gt;&gt; when you get in that presence.
[2:32:42] &gt;&gt; What you really want to do is find a
[2:32:44] place under the carpet.
[2:32:49] Just let me lay down and get as low as I
[2:32:53] possibly can in that moment that he has
[2:32:57] become a covert,
[2:33:00] a shelter,
[2:33:02] a tabernacle,
[2:33:04] shutting out life,
[2:33:09] shutting me in to his glory.
[2:33:13] What if you come to a place in a new
[2:33:16] ministry
[2:33:18] where where you don't have to leave
[2:33:19] those moments
[2:33:22] where you become a person under such
[2:33:25] influence and revelation and inspiration
[2:33:28] that you finish out your days here on
[2:33:30] the earth but untouched
[2:33:34] by what worries and disturbs and
[2:33:38] stresses
[2:33:40] other people.
[2:33:42] You also have problems, but your
[2:33:44] problems don't weigh you down
[2:33:48] &gt;&gt; because you found a shelter from the
[2:33:50] heat,
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; a covert from the storm.
[2:33:54] &gt;&gt; People will say about you, you you think
[2:33:56] you're misunderstood now.
[2:33:59] They'll say then you don't care about
[2:34:00] nobody but yourself.
[2:34:02] &gt;&gt; You have very little compassion, it
[2:34:04] seems, or anybody else. It won't be
[2:34:06] that.
[2:34:07] It won't be that. What it will be is you
[2:34:10] found a place in him in his side
[2:34:15] &gt;&gt; where you never want to leave.
[2:34:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:34:19] &gt;&gt; In that place you discover a new
[2:34:21] ministry.
[2:34:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:34:23] &gt;&gt; That is not executed by effort
[2:34:26] &gt;&gt; or striving
[2:34:27] &gt;&gt; or sweat.
[2:34:31] &gt;&gt; You don't scream your guts out
[2:34:34] &gt;&gt; to try to get somebody to listen to you.
[2:34:36] You don't try to have a vision so you
[2:34:39] can tell somebody what the problem is.
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; It's a new ministry.
[2:34:45] &gt;&gt; It's executed without real physical
[2:34:48] strain and labor and worry and concern.
[2:34:51] It's executed in a creative fashion.
[2:34:56] &gt;&gt; It's executed by the power of the
[2:34:59] creative.
[2:35:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:35:02] &gt;&gt; There shall be light. Yes.
[2:35:04] &gt;&gt; And there was light.
[2:35:07] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I can't accept that."
[2:35:08] Doesn't matter.
[2:35:11] &gt;&gt; It will be,
[2:35:12] &gt;&gt; whether you see it,
[2:35:14] &gt;&gt; whether you experience it,
[2:35:17] &gt;&gt; it won't change. I'm leaning myself into
[2:35:21] a vision.
[2:35:22] &gt;&gt; I'm lending my life to a vision.
[2:35:26] &gt;&gt; If you think it was only five little
[2:35:29] examples and God fizzled out, Come on.
[2:35:34] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:35:35] &gt;&gt; Five examples in the efforts and
[2:35:37] ministry of brother Bham. Five
[2:35:39] executions of the spoken word. If you
[2:35:42] think that's all God's got,
[2:35:46] &gt;&gt; five little sputters of powerful. Don't
[2:35:49] you think I unbelievable
[2:35:53] conviction falling?
[2:35:57] These little snickler fritzes, snicker
[2:35:59] fritzes,
[2:36:01] &gt;&gt; laughing at their stories of God's
[2:36:03] creative power. One minute and the next
[2:36:05] minute,
[2:36:06] &gt;&gt; I give you your sons.
[2:36:10] &gt;&gt; The spirit of God falls upon them. They
[2:36:12] fall over their mother's lap.
[2:36:15] The spirit of God moves on the prophet.
[2:36:17] He said, "Before the doctor's hand
[2:36:19] touches her side, the tumor's gone."
[2:36:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:24] And the very doctor that felt the tumor
[2:36:26] in the first place reaches for the tumor
[2:36:28] to get it. It's gone.
[2:36:30] It's not there.
[2:36:33] A storm that could have taken them all
[2:36:35] to their death by the power of the
[2:36:37] spoken word. The resurrection of a small
[2:36:41] animal. Resurrection life. Listen. Five
[2:36:44] examples. What did I leave out? The
[2:36:47] squirrels. Creative. Creative power. The
[2:36:50] same power. This what he said. You don't
[2:36:52] have to believe it.
[2:36:53] &gt;&gt; The same creative power that put the
[2:36:55] ram.
[2:37:00] &gt;&gt; That put the ram.
[2:37:05] &gt;&gt; It put the lamb in the thicket.
[2:37:10] &gt;&gt; You see the the human carnal mind. It
[2:37:12] says, "Well, a ram was I I mean, I see
[2:37:14] this is doesn't have horns, but it was
[2:37:18] a horned animal. It got hung in the
[2:37:21] thicket that way. In Hebrew, you can
[2:37:24] read it.
[2:37:27] We just think, well, God told Abraham to
[2:37:30] take his son Isaac, and he he's up there
[2:37:32] willing and ready to obey, and God said,
[2:37:34] "No, you don't have to." And so, he
[2:37:38] caused this little ram to stumble in
[2:37:40] there and get hung up. And that became
[2:37:42] the sacrifice.
[2:37:45] After all, Abraham said up the way up,
[2:37:48] excuse me, on the way up the mountain,
[2:37:50] he said, uh, Isaac said, "Daddy, where's
[2:37:52] the sticks? I see how we're going to
[2:37:54] make the fire, father, but who where
[2:37:57] will the sacrifice be?" He didn't know.
[2:37:59] He didn't know
[2:38:00] &gt;&gt; that Abraham so blindly
[2:38:03] believed,
[2:38:05] so so so blindly trusted his creator
[2:38:08] that he was willing to do anything that
[2:38:09] he asked him to do. He didn't know he
[2:38:11] might be, he was going to be, he was
[2:38:13] destined to be at sea. And what did
[2:38:15] Abraham say?
[2:38:17] Son, God will provide himself. Don't you
[2:38:19] worry. God will provide. You need to
[2:38:22] understand that God will provide the
[2:38:23] sacrifice. He has provided the lamb on
[2:38:27] our behalf and he will give you the
[2:38:29] strength you need
[2:38:31] &gt;&gt; to worship him to be what he would
[2:38:33] desire for you to be.
[2:38:35] &gt;&gt; The But we believe I believe by
[2:38:37] supernatural event God brought and this
[2:38:39] shows it. this this sculptor uh
[2:38:44] decided to show it with an angel that
[2:38:45] looks like that. I've never seen one
[2:38:47] like that, but anyway, that was his
[2:38:49] artistic rendition
[2:38:52] of a ram that was brought down and and
[2:38:54] and perhaps the angel just hung it in
[2:38:56] the bush until it was needed.
[2:39:00] This seems to fit the whole typology of
[2:39:02] scripture because Jesus wasn't a man
[2:39:05] that was chosen as he reached a certain
[2:39:07] age to be the lamb.
[2:39:10] He was the lamb as an egg
[2:39:14] as a cell in his mother's belly. He was
[2:39:17] a ram. He was a lamb. He was a
[2:39:19] sacrifice. He was destined to be. God
[2:39:22] put him there.
[2:39:24] &gt;&gt; God overshadowed by the Holy Ghost Mary
[2:39:26] and provided what was needed for
[2:39:28] salvation and deliverance of the Lord. I
[2:39:30] can't believe that. Not with this,
[2:39:34] but with this. So, you're telling me I
[2:39:36] have to lose my intelligence to believe?
[2:39:38] No.
[2:39:39] You've got to let faith rise.
[2:39:42] &gt;&gt; You don't have to be a doofus.
[2:39:46] &gt;&gt; You see, some people look at all
[2:39:48] Christians like they're just a bunch of
[2:39:49] idiots, uneducated fools who don't know
[2:39:53] any better. Don't know anything about
[2:39:56] all I know is this. Before the worlds
[2:39:58] were formed,
[2:39:59] &gt;&gt; he wanted melle.
[2:40:05] &gt;&gt; Beyond that, I am.
[2:40:08] He wanted me
[2:40:10] &gt;&gt; and he wooed and drew
[2:40:13] &gt;&gt; and found
[2:40:15] &gt;&gt; that which he was after. Do you believe
[2:40:17] that
[2:40:19] &gt;&gt; that word tabernacle, would you put that
[2:40:21] up for us?
[2:40:24] Let me remind you and we'll close a
[2:40:25] moment.
[2:40:27] 136.
[2:40:31] And there there shall be the glory upon
[2:40:33] all the glory shall be a defense. There
[2:40:35] shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in
[2:40:37] the daytime from the heat and for a
[2:40:39] place of refuge and a covert from the
[2:40:40] storm. That word tabernacle
[2:40:43] is the same word we mentioned last
[2:40:45] night. It was suk. This is suka.
[2:40:49] It it describes the the booth that's
[2:40:51] built at tabernacles time.
[2:40:53] &gt;&gt; It it is a covert. It is a cottage, a
[2:40:55] booth, a pavilion, a tabernacle, a tent,
[2:40:58] a temporary shelter.
[2:41:00] I I imagine some of you didn't know how
[2:41:02] many times these same words were used
[2:41:04] interchangeably through the scripture.
[2:41:06] God's always pointing people to a place
[2:41:08] to hide, to rest, to be covered, to be
[2:41:12] secret, to have fellowship, to have
[2:41:15] intimacy. It's a beautiful picture. And
[2:41:18] and go back that word defense. Can you
[2:41:21] show it to us in verse five? The glory.
[2:41:25] The glory. For upon all the glory shall
[2:41:30] be a defense. Do you know what Hebrew
[2:41:32] word that is? It's the word for the
[2:41:34] bridal canopy. The hoopa.
[2:41:40] It's translated here defense.
[2:41:45] Let's see what it means. Chamber.
[2:41:47] Closet. Defense. A nuptual chamber. It's
[2:41:51] a feminine noun referring to a chamber,
[2:41:53] a closet, a cover, a canopy, andor a
[2:41:57] defense, a pavilion of marriage.
[2:42:01] It refers figuratively to the bridal
[2:42:04] chamber from which the sun comes forth
[2:42:08] in Psalm 195 and 6.
[2:42:11] And in Joel 21:16, it indicates a mighty
[2:42:14] protective canopy over God's people in
[2:42:17] Isaiah 4:5.
[2:42:20] It's a place where the vows are
[2:42:21] exchanged.
[2:42:24] But in biblical times, it wasn't just
[2:42:26] the place where the vows were exchanged.
[2:42:31] Because after the covenant was sealed,
[2:42:35] the curtains were hung.
[2:42:39] And it became the nuptual chamber.
[2:42:43] It became the place of intimacy
[2:42:46] where the bride and the bridegroom
[2:42:48] became one.
[2:42:53] And when they came out of that bridal
[2:42:55] chamber, can you imagine
[2:42:58] their guests are still at the party?
[2:43:02] It lasted at least seven days in the
[2:43:04] Orient.
[2:43:06] the celebration.
[2:43:08] Can you imagine the pressure
[2:43:11] of knowing that all of your guests are
[2:43:13] waiting for you
[2:43:15] to make the seal
[2:43:19] of your union?
[2:43:22] And yet that's how it was done.
[2:43:26] Deuteronomy tells us that it was so
[2:43:28] literal
[2:43:30] that there was a piece of cloth
[2:43:33] laid down. I'll be careful.
[2:43:38] So that when the union took place, it
[2:43:40] was believed
[2:43:43] that when the membrane was broken,
[2:43:46] I won't even say the word for you to
[2:43:49] have to face it.
[2:43:52] But the ancients believe that when that
[2:43:54] membrane was broken, there was always
[2:43:56] blood. We now know that that is not
[2:43:58] necessarily the case.
[2:44:03] But it likely is, often is if a woman is
[2:44:07] a virgin.
[2:44:10] Literally
[2:44:12] they that sheet in Deuteronomy 20
[2:44:19] 5 23
[2:44:22] Deuteronomy 23
[2:44:25] vers
[2:44:27] is it 13 through
[2:44:30] what? Can you put that up? I won't read
[2:44:33] it but I'll need the reference. I want
[2:44:35] you to write this down because if I
[2:44:38] wasn't such a long-winded preacher, I
[2:44:39] could have got to all my notes in in an
[2:44:41] hour. If I was smarter, if I was better
[2:44:43] at it, I do. I confess all of that. Uh I
[2:44:48] had too much hay on my fork. I I uh I
[2:44:51] gave you those scriptures this morning,
[2:44:53] so I know you got it somewhere. I wished
[2:44:54] I I can just give you the place and
[2:44:56] maybe it'll help you find it. We're
[2:44:58] we're leaving
[2:45:00] Deuteronomy 22
[2:45:04] 13-21.
[2:45:06] It it it refers in one of those verses
[2:45:09] to the tokens of her virginity.
[2:45:13] And it's referring to that sheet, that
[2:45:16] cloth.
[2:45:17] And it was such a literal experience
[2:45:21] that that sheet was folded up
[2:45:24] and preserved.
[2:45:27] It was then handed. There it is.
[2:45:31] It was handed to the father
[2:45:34] of the bride.
[2:45:38] It's holy.
[2:45:40] It's not just about pleasure.
[2:45:43] It's holy.
[2:45:45] It's a seal. It's a covenant.
[2:45:50] The world has made it sick,
[2:45:53] perverted, nasty.
[2:45:57] But God instituted it as a holy seal
[2:46:02] because God is a God who believes whose
[2:46:04] whose covenant says it's once. Marriage
[2:46:08] is once.
[2:46:10] It's not easy. It don't always turn out
[2:46:13] the way you want it to,
[2:46:16] but that's what it is.
[2:46:19] And therefore,
[2:46:21] father of the bride gets the sheet.
[2:46:26] I've stood in the museum in in
[2:46:28] Jerusalem, the Israeli museum, and I
[2:46:30] have seen the ancient uh bags
[2:46:34] that are hand embroidered among the
[2:46:36] Yemenes, the Yemenite Jews, the Iraqi
[2:46:39] Jews, the Iranian Jews, the Sphartic
[2:46:42] Jews,
[2:46:44] darkerkinned Jews.
[2:46:48] I was going to call another group and it
[2:46:51] slipped my mind. And they made these
[2:46:53] little bags so that the the sheet was
[2:46:55] folded up and put in that bag and it was
[2:46:58] kept. The father kept that as for
[2:47:00] safekeeping. So that if that man ever
[2:47:02] got tired of this little wife like
[2:47:04] happens even in our ranks,
[2:47:08] if some other little younger Philly
[2:47:10] comes along,
[2:47:13] don't get me started.
[2:47:17] Then all of a sudden he he pulls from
[2:47:20] the well a story.
[2:47:22] Well, she wasn't a virgin. She wasn't
[2:47:24] pure when I married her. How in the
[2:47:27] world did it take you 30 years to figure
[2:47:29] that out?
[2:47:34] &gt;&gt; This would have been right away known.
[2:47:37] The Bible then says that father can
[2:47:39] cancel that vow.
[2:47:45] if deception has taken place and there
[2:47:48] is no proof.
[2:47:52] But if there's proof that you let's just
[2:47:57] spiritualize it for just a moment.
[2:47:59] You're not going to be able to go on
[2:48:00] what you say.
[2:48:03] I I've been with him. I've been with the
[2:48:05] Lord. I've had my f my Bible time. I've
[2:48:08] had my me time with God. You've missed
[2:48:10] it. If it's me time with God, you've
[2:48:13] missed it.
[2:48:15] &gt;&gt; It's not me time.
[2:48:18] &gt;&gt; It's his time. Him time. That's it,
[2:48:20] Sister George. Him time.
[2:48:23] It's me time pulling away from your f.
[2:48:25] But it's not about you. It's about him.
[2:48:28] &gt;&gt; But guess who gets the most out of it.
[2:48:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:48:33] You're then there'll be a little bride
[2:48:35] come forth with proof.
[2:48:40] Oh, you've been with him. Oh, yes. I saw
[2:48:43] the prophet. I believe the prophet. I I
[2:48:44] know God sent a prophet.
[2:48:48] You've been with him? I've been in a
[2:48:50] message church for 30 years. Do you have
[2:48:53] the Holy Ghost? Sure. Couldn't believe
[2:48:54] there was a prophet if I didn't have the
[2:48:56] Holy Ghost. Baloney. The devil believes
[2:48:59] that God uses prophets.
[2:49:01] &gt;&gt; He doesn't have the Holy Ghost. Proof.
[2:49:04] &gt;&gt; Bring the sheet.
[2:49:07] If we spend that time in that intimate
[2:49:10] place, if we see the new ministry that
[2:49:13] he told us about, if the bride has that
[2:49:15] little quick short work
[2:49:18] &gt;&gt; that culminates in a resurrection,
[2:49:22] &gt;&gt; where the dead in Christ rise
[2:49:25] &gt;&gt; and appear just like they did in
[2:49:28] Jerusalem.
[2:49:30] If we see that it will be because we
[2:49:33] have proven with our life with our with
[2:49:36] our the way we treat people
[2:49:41] &gt;&gt; not our religious talk.
[2:49:43] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[2:49:44] Thank you Jesus. Hallelujah.
[2:49:46] &gt;&gt; The life.
[2:49:48] &gt;&gt; The life.
[2:49:51] &gt;&gt; These signs shall follow them.
[2:49:56] That's right.
[2:49:59] that believe.
[2:50:08] One day, one day, one day,
[2:50:12] one day,
[2:50:15] let me end with this.
[2:50:19] Two places I want to read in closing.
[2:50:22] Identification of Christ in all ages.
[2:50:24] 1964, Birmingham.
[2:50:30] Alabama,
[2:50:37] the meetings that my grandmother
[2:50:39] attended.
[2:50:41] So that makes it very special to me.
[2:50:45] This meeting was April the 9th of 1964.
[2:50:52] He's praying a prayer. Heavenly Father.
[2:50:58] Oh, just a minute. I need a breath.
[2:51:01] We are grateful to see the risen
[2:51:05] Messiah.
[2:51:07] 1900 years of all kinds of theology and
[2:51:11] movements,
[2:51:13] but still in the darkness of all of it.
[2:51:18] You promised that you would appear here
[2:51:24] in the last days
[2:51:26] in this Sodom day and you would make
[2:51:30] yourself known to the children of
[2:51:33] Abraham, the called, the elected.
[2:51:38] And here you are tonight. After 1900
[2:51:42] years,
[2:51:44] you are just as much alive tonight as
[2:51:49] you was when you talked to the woman at
[2:51:53] the well.
[2:51:55] &gt;&gt; And if you stopped reading,
[2:51:58] you would think he was only referring to
[2:52:00] himself.
[2:52:02] This is Jesus
[2:52:04] ministering in me. But he didn't stop
[2:52:08] there.
[2:52:09] He said it's God manifested in flesh now
[2:52:15] in the flesh
[2:52:18] &gt;&gt; bride
[2:52:24] &gt;&gt; of his bride.
[2:52:27] For the bride and the husband
[2:52:31] is the same self
[2:52:35] &gt;&gt; flesh
[2:52:36] &gt;&gt; one together
[2:52:38] fellowship
[2:52:40] under the tabernacle under the folds of
[2:52:43] the tent in the secret place in the
[2:52:46] pavilion in the hiding place on the
[2:52:48] rock. It couldn't just be millennium and
[2:52:53] it couldn't be beyond millennium
[2:52:56] because in that new heaven and new earth
[2:52:59] we won't experience the light of a
[2:53:02] created sun.
[2:53:05] &gt;&gt; For in that realm there is neither need
[2:53:09] for any of those created elements or
[2:53:14] candles.
[2:53:16] For the Bible said Christ himself is the
[2:53:18] light.
[2:53:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if we're going to have a covert
[2:53:21] from the heat, from the sun, from the
[2:53:25] storm,
[2:53:27] &gt;&gt; it must not just be talking about in the
[2:53:30] sweet by and by.
[2:53:32] &gt;&gt; There must be a period of time that the
[2:53:34] bride enters into a place of holy union,
[2:53:38] &gt;&gt; the invisible union
[2:53:42] &gt;&gt; of a heavenly bridegroom
[2:53:45] &gt;&gt; and an earthly bride. There must be
[2:53:48] something culminating yet.
[2:53:52] Not a new message, not a new prophet,
[2:53:55] not an eighth messenger, not a chief
[2:53:57] apostle,
[2:53:59] &gt;&gt; none of those things.
[2:54:01] &gt;&gt; Bride.
[2:54:03] The bride.
[2:54:06] &gt;&gt; The bride.
[2:54:08] Wherever she is, the bride.
[2:54:12] Musicians come.
[2:54:18] Here's the last one.
[2:54:21] Oh, I didn't finish that one, did I?
[2:54:24] These two are one now in the flesh of
[2:54:26] his bride. For the bride and the husband
[2:54:28] is the self-same flesh. These two are
[2:54:30] one. And the church
[2:54:32] is becoming the bride. That's part of
[2:54:35] the transition. Right?
[2:54:36] &gt;&gt; You begin to recognize, hey,
[2:54:40] I got feathers
[2:54:42] and they've got feathers,
[2:54:46] but my feathers ain't like their
[2:54:47] feathers.
[2:54:51] &gt;&gt; Their feathers only get them to the
[2:54:53] fence post.
[2:54:55] But I'm beginning to see that my
[2:54:57] feathers take me a little higher
[2:55:01] &gt;&gt; because I wasn't born to be a chicken
[2:55:05] &gt;&gt; or a turkey,
[2:55:07] &gt;&gt; but an eagle.
[2:55:09] &gt;&gt; Scripture all through scripture. Eagle.
[2:55:11] Is Elelliana asleep? Eagle.
[2:55:16] Eagle. Honey. Eagle. Elelliana. Jane.
[2:55:19] Eagle.
[2:55:21] Not a chicken. Higher.
[2:55:25] Amen.
[2:55:27] &gt;&gt; Getting up above
[2:55:31] stuff
[2:55:32] &gt;&gt; emotion. We're nearly done.
[2:55:36] How many of you realize that you are a
[2:55:39] part of that eagle?
[2:55:41] &gt;&gt; That overcoming getting above.
[2:55:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I heard a scream.
[2:55:47] &gt;&gt; I recognize that I don't have to spend
[2:55:49] my whole life in the barnyard.
[2:55:53] Jehovah Eagle has made a way for me to
[2:55:55] go higher.
[2:55:56] &gt;&gt; Now, back to this quotation. Uh, these
[2:55:59] two are one and the church is becoming
[2:56:00] the bride all the time by believing the
[2:56:03] word. There's ing on this by believing
[2:56:05] the word. It's happening all the time.
[2:56:07] Becoming the bride, believing the word.
[2:56:09] So that the word and the church
[2:56:14] &gt;&gt; becomes the same. the word in the church
[2:56:17] making it the bride.
[2:56:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:56:20] &gt;&gt; The revelation, the unveiling of Christ
[2:56:23] &gt;&gt; pulls many from the church
[2:56:26] to a higher place,
[2:56:29] &gt;&gt; the last sign.
[2:56:35] &gt;&gt; I hear this preached all the time that
[2:56:38] brother Brandham is the last sign.
[2:56:42] You embarrass him with your misplaced
[2:56:46] theology.
[2:56:48] &gt;&gt; He said, "If you don't quit saying those
[2:56:50] things, you you make me an antichrist."
[2:56:54] &gt;&gt; I'll quit. I'll come off the field. I
[2:56:56] would rather face God a quitter than to
[2:56:59] face him as an antichrist.
[2:57:01] &gt;&gt; People cannot let men be men.
[2:57:05] Flawed men, human beings chosen mightily
[2:57:09] used of God,
[2:57:11] worthy of double honor. Yes, but not to
[2:57:15] be worshiped
[2:57:17] &gt;&gt; or exonerated as gods.
[2:57:24] You don't have to sit in church every
[2:57:26] Sunday and look at him
[2:57:30] to believe
[2:57:33] the word in the church making it the
[2:57:35] last sign. What a prophet. That's not
[2:57:38] what he's saying. God identifying
[2:57:41] himself. The word in the church.
[2:57:46] &gt;&gt; Identification of Christ of all ages.
[2:57:48] Birmingham. Now here's the last one.
[2:57:50] Play something soft. Say something
[2:57:52] that'll make the preacher shut up. You
[2:57:54] have anything like that?
[2:58:01] In my feeble attempt, I want to close
[2:58:04] and culminate everything said in two
[2:58:06] services with this quotation. Hear it
[2:58:09] carefully. Hear it very carefully. Write
[2:58:12] it down. Hold on to it. Take a picture
[2:58:15] of it. Paragraph 474.
[2:58:19] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[2:58:21] 1963. Take a picture of it if you have
[2:58:24] your phone handy. Use the thing for
[2:58:26] something smart.
[2:58:29] So you'll be able to go and find it.
[2:58:30] That's not all of it. That's just the
[2:58:31] first part of it. But get a picture of
[2:58:33] it. That's how I remember things. I'm
[2:58:35] sorry. I'm getting older.
[2:58:38] I tell myself I'm going to remember, but
[2:58:40] if I don't snap it, screenshot it, I
[2:58:42] don't.
[2:58:44] This is God's. I I want you to stand up
[2:58:48] because we're we're that serious about
[2:58:50] it. Some of you don't even believe me.
[2:58:53] I'm I'm not very trustworthy to you, am
[2:58:54] I? Because I threaten so often. But I
[2:58:57] want you to be standing so you can catch
[2:58:58] this. This is God's great mystery of
[2:59:04] love
[2:59:05] &gt;&gt; expressed
[2:59:09] &gt;&gt; that God and man
[2:59:12] became one.
[2:59:15] The whole thing is God and man one.
[2:59:20] &gt;&gt; Don't misunderstand.
[2:59:24] &gt;&gt; Don't get weird.
[2:59:27] &gt;&gt; This is too beautiful to be weird.
[2:59:31] &gt;&gt; You are not God.
[2:59:33] &gt;&gt; You are the man part of the equation.
[2:59:37] &gt;&gt; He is the God part of the equation. And
[2:59:41] when he fully occupies you,
[2:59:45] &gt;&gt; you have creative power
[2:59:48] &gt;&gt; and authority because he is with you.
[2:59:53] &gt;&gt; He is in you.
[2:59:55] &gt;&gt; Not because you.
[2:59:58] &gt;&gt; So this isn't making men gods.
[3:00:01] No,
[3:00:03] this is joining God with man to become
[3:00:08] one for a quick short explosion
[3:00:13] of God's authority and power. Lord,
[3:00:16] please let me live to see it
[3:00:22] &gt;&gt; more than seeing my children married and
[3:00:25] happy and my grandchildren happy.
[3:00:29] Above everything, I'm not trying to be
[3:00:31] emotional.
[3:00:33] Above everything, I beg him.
[3:00:36] Every time I have a pain, every time I
[3:00:37] have a feeling, I I rebuke it. I can't
[3:00:40] get sick, can't die now, can't can't get
[3:00:43] old before my time.
[3:00:45] &gt;&gt; Every time I hear someone leaving soon,
[3:00:47] doesn't even know they're sick and die,
[3:00:48] I say, "Oh, God, just let me live with
[3:00:52] my right mind
[3:00:54] &gt;&gt; just long enough to see a people
[3:01:01] It doesn't have to be a long time.
[3:01:04] Just give me a few days to see a bride
[3:01:07] operating in full adoption.
[3:01:13] She wouldn't dare speak a word on her
[3:01:17] own.
[3:01:18] It would only be what the bridegroom
[3:01:20] would have her to say.
[3:01:23] Jesus, God in the flesh, yet he moved by
[3:01:25] vision and he said, "I can do nothing
[3:01:28] except it is given to me, shown to me of
[3:01:31] my father." The bride will operate in
[3:01:34] that kind of authority. Hallelujah.
[3:01:37] All of creation groans. The New
[3:01:39] Testament said, "For the manifestation
[3:01:41] of the sons of God.
[3:01:55] Let us see it.
[3:02:03] God and man is one. What is it? Being
[3:02:07] filled with his spirit.
[3:02:10] Him having the preeminences.
[3:02:14] You can be in church and not be under
[3:02:16] the hoopa.
[3:02:18] &gt;&gt; You can be in church and not be under
[3:02:20] the pavilion.
[3:02:21] &gt;&gt; I place myself under the tabernacle of
[3:02:24] the Lord today.
[3:02:26] I place myself under your pavilion,
[3:02:29] Lord. I place myself under your
[3:02:32] authority.
[3:02:34] Now work in me, Lord. Do for me what I
[3:02:36] can't do for myself and for this
[3:02:39] precious people gathered here today.
[3:02:43] you having the preeminences. He said
[3:02:46] that was God's achievement.
[3:02:48] That's God's purpose to do that. He
[3:02:51] might that he might be in Christ and
[3:02:55] Christ
[3:02:56] in us and all of us together.
[3:03:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:03:06] &gt;&gt; No two soul. No. Are you thunder? Are
[3:03:10] you return?
[3:03:13] Are you seventh seal open? Are you
[3:03:15] seventh seal closed? Are you none of
[3:03:18] that?
[3:03:20] It does not matter.
[3:03:24] When we are one in Christ,
[3:03:27] doctrine matters nothing
[3:03:31] because if you have doctrine and cannot
[3:03:33] produce, reproduce the life of Christ.
[3:03:36] If you have religion and you can't
[3:03:38] reproduce the life of Christ, it's vain.
[3:03:42] &gt;&gt; It's vain.
[3:03:46] Benjamin, be ready.
[3:03:48] That God's that was God's achievement.
[3:03:51] That's God's purpose to do that. That he
[3:03:52] might be in Christ. Christ in us, all of
[3:03:55] us together, one.
[3:03:58] The Holy Spirit,
[3:04:01] same thing.
[3:04:03] It revealed it to Christ. Reveals it
[3:04:06] here.
[3:04:09] Somebody else read that
[3:04:14] power.
[3:04:17] &gt;&gt; The supernatural creative power.
[3:04:22] &gt;&gt; I can't believe in that. That's up to
[3:04:25] you.
[3:04:29] He said missing limbs.
[3:04:34] would be restored.
[3:04:38] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I can't believe that."
[3:04:43] But I'm like, "You, Sister George, I
[3:04:45] can't afford not to believe it. I have
[3:04:46] to believe it. I've given my all
[3:04:50] &gt;&gt; for the vision.
[3:04:53] I couldn't walk away from it now if I if
[3:04:55] I wanted to. I don't, but I couldn't
[3:04:58] because it's everything to me.
[3:05:01] I want him to have the wife that he was
[3:05:06] looking for.
[3:05:08] &gt;&gt; I I don't know for sure, but in my mind,
[3:05:11] I think this I think that if I knew I
[3:05:16] could never be that, I would still want
[3:05:19] to help somebody else be that
[3:05:23] &gt;&gt; because if he said it,
[3:05:27] &gt;&gt; it's got to be so.
[3:05:28] &gt;&gt; That's right. He cannot lie.
[3:05:31] [Music]
[3:05:34] &gt;&gt; It happens in the ocean.
[3:05:38] &gt;&gt; There are certain species of
[3:05:42] starfish
[3:05:45] that lose an arm.
[3:05:48] And God has placed in that creation the
[3:05:52] regenerative power
[3:05:56] and the cells
[3:05:59] reproduce themselves
[3:06:01] and rush to that wound and begin to
[3:06:04] rebuild what is lost. If God can do that
[3:06:08] for a silly little starfish, you're
[3:06:10] trying to tell me that God couldn't do
[3:06:12] that for one of his own.
[3:06:14] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I can't accept that. I cannot
[3:06:17] accept that. It's supernatural creative
[3:06:20] power. There will be a people, but she
[3:06:22] won't come by it automatic.
[3:06:25] She'll only come by it by spending time
[3:06:27] with him.
[3:06:29] &gt;&gt; Cover us, Lord.
[3:06:30] &gt;&gt; Would you ask him right now before we
[3:06:32] worship? Cover me, Lord.
[3:06:35] Be my covert,
[3:06:38] &gt;&gt; my pavilion, my tabernacle, my refuge,
[3:06:41] my hiding place.
[3:06:43] Be my holy of holies.
[3:06:48] Let me be transformed
[3:06:51] by your presence.
[3:06:54] This life is not ours anymore. It's you
[3:06:56] who lives in us.
[3:06:59] Be real to us, Lord. Let somebody today.
[3:07:03] Let somebody.
[3:07:06] I don't care if they're eight
[3:07:09] or 80.
[3:07:11] &gt;&gt; Let somebody believe. Yes.
[3:07:15] &gt;&gt; Let somebody grab it and say, "I want to
[3:07:18] give my life to that truth.
[3:07:22] &gt;&gt; I want to be that example
[3:07:28] [Music]
[3:07:34] &gt;&gt; and I'll come running after you."
[3:07:39] [Music]
[3:07:41] Draw
[3:07:43] me.
[3:07:46] Draw me, Lord,
[3:07:50] and I'll come running after you.
[3:07:57] Draw
[3:07:59] me,

[3:09:17] me. Oh,
[3:09:20] draw me, Lord.
[3:09:23] and I'll come running after you.

[3:09:50] Won't you draw me, Lord?
[3:09:54] I'll come running after you.

[3:10:03] me.
[3:10:06] Draw me, Lord.

[3:10:31] Oh, draw
[3:10:33] me.
[3:10:36] Draw me, Lord,
[3:10:40] and I'll come running after you.

[3:18:43] into your embrace.
[3:18:47] Draw me my beloved and let me look into

[3:18:55] My beloved
[3:18:57] is mine
[3:18:59] and I am his Lord. Draw
[3:19:05] me close
[3:19:07] to you.
[3:19:11] Awake north winds
[3:19:15] and come thou south.
[3:19:20] Low upon my garden
[3:19:23] that the spices may flow out.
[3:19:27] My beloved
[3:19:29] is mine
[3:19:31] and I am his. Lord just draw me close
[3:19:39] to you.
[3:19:43] And draw me my beloved
[3:19:48] into your embrace.
[3:19:51] Draw me my beloved and let me look into
[3:19:57] your face. Cuz my beloved
[3:20:01] is mine.
[3:20:03] Oh, and I am.
[3:20:06] Lord to strong
[3:20:09] me close
[3:20:11] to you.
[3:20:15] &gt;&gt; Awake
[3:20:16] north wind
[3:20:19] and blow. Come thou south.
[3:20:23] &gt;&gt; Blow upon my garden
[3:20:27] that the spice is made.
[3:20:30] Oh, my blood
[3:20:33] is mine
[3:20:35] and I am
[3:20:38] &gt;&gt; draw
[3:20:44] real soft on the music. Let's hear the
[3:20:46] voices. Draw me.
[3:20:48] &gt;&gt; Draw me.
[3:20:50] &gt;&gt; Let it be your prayer right now.
[3:20:55] &gt;&gt; Draw me Lord.
[3:21:00] Let me look into your face.
[3:21:05] &gt;&gt; My love is
[3:21:13] draw.
[3:21:21] We have nothing to sell
[3:21:26] there. There's no gimmick here.
[3:21:30] It's just a question.
[3:21:33] Are you willing to lend yourself
[3:21:37] to a vision that you didn't have
[3:21:41] to see God perform what he promised in
[3:21:45] his word?
[3:21:47] I'm willing.
[3:21:49] I'm willing.
[3:21:52] I I just took a glance. 1964, he says,
[3:21:55] "Far as I know," this is him talking.
[3:21:57] "Far as I know, it hasn't happened yet.
[3:22:00] I read you last night, 65, where he
[3:22:03] said, "Maybe this will be the thing that
[3:22:05] drives us into that tent." 1965.
[3:22:09] He didn't see it.
[3:22:13] I can't tell you what that does to me.
[3:22:17] I've never been able to explain it.
[3:22:21] It's It's scripture for prophets to pass
[3:22:25] and not see the fulfillment. It's
[3:22:28] scripture.
[3:22:29] It's what forerunners do.
[3:22:32] But somebody somewhere,
[3:22:35] and I refuse to make up something and
[3:22:38] say, "Well, it happened and he missed
[3:22:39] it, or it happened and no one knew it."
[3:22:41] And I don't believe there can come a
[3:22:44] company of people with creative power.
[3:22:46] and nobody know anything about it. I
[3:22:48] don't think it means one miracle
[3:22:50] &gt;&gt; in a region.
[3:22:52] &gt;&gt; I don't think it's going to be years in
[3:22:54] the in the in the duration. He said a
[3:22:57] quick short work.
[3:23:02] What does that mean? I don't know.
[3:23:05] But all of creation's groaning for it.
[3:23:07] The least you and I can do is grunt
[3:23:09] every once in a while,
[3:23:12] longing for it.
[3:23:14] Just be Jesus in me. Lord, just come and
[3:23:17] be real and be Lord in my life.
[3:23:21] When we used to have meetings years ago,
[3:23:23] fellowship times and missionary times,
[3:23:25] they would give a call and they would
[3:23:27] ask, "Who wants to come and give your
[3:23:28] life as a missionary and service for the
[3:23:31] Lord?" And I saw many people launched
[3:23:34] into international world ministries as
[3:23:37] little missionaries because they felt
[3:23:39] moved to do so. That's not what this
[3:23:43] Closing service is about this is about
[3:23:46] wondering would you be willing to to
[3:23:48] lend everything you have
[3:23:52] to be one of those.
[3:23:54] It means that you have to get rid of
[3:23:57] some
[3:23:59] bitterness, some
[3:24:01] some resentment, some offense,
[3:24:07] some pride, whatever. I don't know. But
[3:24:10] it means that you just empty yourself.
[3:24:13] It's a process. I get it. I know I'm in
[3:24:15] it. Less of me, Lord, more of you. But
[3:24:20] but it's a it's a it's a vision out
[3:24:22] there. It's a go. It's something out
[3:24:24] there that's tangible if we can get to
[3:24:26] it. It's promised in the book. There
[3:24:29] will be overcomers in Leodysia. There
[3:24:32] was a church in Babylon. If there was a
[3:24:34] church in Babylon, there will be a bride
[3:24:36] in the last day
[3:24:37] &gt;&gt; surely. who has that authority. If
[3:24:40] you're willing, I I'm not we have
[3:24:42] nothing to join, but if you're willing,
[3:24:44] would you just tell the Lord right now,
[3:24:46] Lord, I'm willing to yield my life to be
[3:24:50] what you promised I could be. And it's
[3:24:53] not because I need to be a hero. It's
[3:24:56] simply because I I need to be a vessel
[3:25:01] for you to come and finish your work in
[3:25:03] the earth.
[3:25:06] I'm not trying to get out of my duty.
[3:25:08] I'm trying to get in it, Lord. Use me.
[3:25:12] Use me, sisters. You're usable.
[3:25:16] You may never fulfill You may never
[3:25:18] fulfill a pullpit ministry, but you're
[3:25:19] usable.
[3:25:21] You're God's chosen. He can use you in
[3:25:25] mighty ways
[3:25:27] for your family, for your neighbors, for
[3:25:30] your church sisters.
[3:25:33] He can use you in ways that you have
[3:25:35] never been used before. Are you willing
[3:25:37] to be usable, brothers? We're not all
[3:25:41] pastors. We're not all preachers, but
[3:25:43] we're all usable.
[3:25:45] &gt;&gt; Will you Will you let him use you? If
[3:25:48] so, tell him. Tell him today, "Lord,
[3:25:51] here we are. Here we are.
[3:25:53] You've done so much for us
[3:25:56] until it feels
[3:25:58] almost wrong to ask you to keep doing,
[3:26:02] but Lord, you promised you're the same.
[3:26:05] you don't change. And even after all
[3:26:08] you've done, we still need you in our
[3:26:11] lives to help us come to a place where
[3:26:15] we can yield to you and be all that you
[3:26:17] have created us to be. For some people,
[3:26:19] they're tired of waiting. They've given
[3:26:21] up. They've forsaken the journey. Their
[3:26:24] criticisms have overtaken them. They're
[3:26:27] back in a life of sin.
[3:26:30] But I thank you, Lord, for every person
[3:26:32] who lays their shoulder up against the
[3:26:34] plow today and says, "I'll plow on. I'll
[3:26:37] press on. I'll pray on. I'll praise on.
[3:26:42] I'll surrender more. I'll let that word
[3:26:45] become a living reality in my life."
[3:26:50] &gt;&gt; While old-timers are passing from the
[3:26:52] scene, Lord, a new generation must catch
[3:26:56] the vision. A new generation must step
[3:26:59] up and say, "I lend myself to the
[3:27:03] fulfillment of that vision
[3:27:06] that the lamb might may receive the
[3:27:08] reward for his suffering in me.
[3:27:13] My stuff is not so big that God can't
[3:27:16] use me.
[3:27:18] &gt;&gt; Would you surrender in this one? In this
[3:27:20] one moment, it's you and him.
[3:27:22] No one is monitoring your prayer. It's
[3:27:24] you and him. Lord, here I am.
[3:27:28] Here I am.
[3:27:30] Here I am, Lord.
[3:27:34] You might even tell him, "You're stuck
[3:27:36] with me. You called me.
[3:27:38] You saved me. You sanctified me. You're
[3:27:40] stuck with me. I'm going to be a part of
[3:27:42] this. I'm going to keep positioning
[3:27:45] myself under the spout where your glory
[3:27:48] runs out. I want my life to matter. I
[3:27:51] want my life to count. I want my
[3:27:53] existence to matter. I don't want to get
[3:27:55] down to the end of my life and wonder
[3:27:57] what it was all about. I want to see you
[3:27:59] glorified and exalted in my family, in
[3:28:03] my neighborhood, in my region, in my
[3:28:05] nation, and to the nations of the world.
[3:28:07] I want to see your name glorified and
[3:28:10] lifted up. I want someone to know the
[3:28:12] reality of a of a unchanging,
[3:28:15] unconditional, loving God. Hallelujah.
[3:28:19] Hallelujah.
[3:28:20] We're not interested in being church
[3:28:22] members.
[3:28:25] We surrender as disciples.
[3:28:32] He's the lily of the valley.
[3:28:37] He's the bright and morning star.
[3:28:43] He's the fairest of 10,000
[3:28:47] to my soul.
[3:28:51] He's the beautiful rose of sheriff. He
[3:28:57] means more than this world to me.
[3:29:01] And best of all, he is my coming king.
[3:29:08] Sing it as your prayer. Oh Jesus,
[3:29:14] use me. Oh Lord, don't refuse me too
[3:29:18] low.
[3:29:20] Surely there's a work that I can do.
[3:29:26] Even though it's humble and even though
[3:29:31] it's humble,
[3:29:33] Lord, help my will to crumble.
[3:29:37] And though the cross be greater,
[3:29:43] &gt;&gt; give me a little better key for me.
[3:29:44] Thank you. I'm sorry.
[3:29:53] Are we agreed?
[3:29:56] Jesus,
[3:29:59] use me.
[3:30:01] Oh Lord, don't refuse me.
[3:30:06] Surely there's a work that I can do
[3:30:14] &gt;&gt; and even though
[3:30:19] &gt;&gt; help my will
[3:30:23] &gt;&gt; and
[3:30:28] sing it again. Jesus use me. Oh Jesus,
[3:30:35] use me.
[3:30:37] Oh Lord, don't refuse me.
[3:30:42] Surely there's a word that I
[3:30:49] &gt;&gt; and even though
[3:30:53] [Music]
[3:30:55] &gt;&gt; I will be crumbled
[3:30:59] though the cross be great.
[3:31:07] &gt;&gt; I will stand for you dear Jesus.
[3:31:11] Though death should come my way,
[3:31:16] I'll spread the gospel to the fallen
[3:31:21] here.
[3:31:25] And should it be your will, Lord, for me
[3:31:29] to go across the sea,
[3:31:34] oh help me, willing, Jesus,
[3:31:42] singing Jesus.
[3:31:48] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, don't
[3:31:50] &gt;&gt; surely there's a word.
[3:31:59] &gt;&gt; And even though it's humble,
[3:32:15] Lord, whatever you would have us do,
[3:32:19] you speak and we're ready
[3:32:22] to be obedient to you. Thank you for
[3:32:24] this service today. Thank you for your
[3:32:26] presence. Thank you for these beautiful
[3:32:29] children and young people. Some had to
[3:32:32] step way out of their comfort zone to
[3:32:34] sing in front of us. I ask you to bless
[3:32:38] them with courage, with anointing, and
[3:32:41] with holy desire. May they not have to
[3:32:44] be pushed or shoved or pulled, but may
[3:32:47] they find a desire to bless your people.
[3:32:51] It's not just those little ones, Lord,
[3:32:53] that have a promise. It's not just those
[3:32:55] little ones that have potential.
[3:32:57] &gt;&gt; All of us have something to do for you.
[3:33:00] Lord, draw us everyone close to you in
[3:33:03] this hour and we'll give you praise and
[3:33:05] honor and glory for it's in the name of
[3:33:07] the Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. Who
[3:33:10] has something to chew on at least?
[3:33:13] &gt;&gt; I hope you do. I hope you do. Uh please
[3:33:16] be mindful that there are those who have
[3:33:18] a long way to journey today. And that
[3:33:21] means the quicker you can get your food
[3:33:24] back here warm here ready to eat, the
[3:33:27] better for them. I always get that
[3:33:30] feeling. I felt like my granny because
[3:33:32] she always worried that people would
[3:33:34] would have to leave before they could
[3:33:36] have something to eat. So, as as fast if
[3:33:40] some of us will just be fast, you got
[3:33:43] plenty of time to fellowship this
[3:33:45] afternoon.
[3:33:47] Say, "God bless you and wave and run to
[3:33:48] your car. bring your food back so that
[3:33:51] these who have to go to Carolina and
[3:33:53] Indiana and wherever else. Uh maybe some
[3:33:56] aren't leaving today, but I know some
[3:33:58] are. I want them to have something good
[3:34:01] and southern and fattening. I want Luke
[3:34:06] uh to have something fattening to take
[3:34:09] back to Wisconsin with him.
[3:34:12] I do.
[3:34:14] I I told him last night, you need
[3:34:16] biscuits and gravy.
[3:34:19] You need We have dessert with breakfast.
[3:34:22] Did you see that last night? We have
[3:34:24] dessert when we have our breakfast. I
[3:34:26] want everybody to have something good to
[3:34:29] eat. Uh we're blessed.
[3:34:33] Camp meeting is going to be incredible.
[3:34:36] God's going to be with us until then.
[3:34:38] &gt;&gt; How many of you love one another? If
[3:34:41] there is somebody in this room
[3:34:44] that you don't like,
[3:34:48] you are going to have to love them
[3:34:51] &gt;&gt; or you're going to miss it.
[3:34:53] You might as well practice.
[3:34:57] You might as well practice. I'm not
[3:34:59] being funny. It is kind of funny that we
[3:35:02] have to think of these things. You
[3:35:04] better love people. I better love
[3:35:06] people. Whether I can get on with them
[3:35:08] or not, I've got to learn to love them.
[3:35:11] I've got to love them like Christ loved
[3:35:13] them. Boy, that ain't easy. It's easy to
[3:35:16] say,
[3:35:17] &gt;&gt; harder to do.
[3:35:18] &gt;&gt; But how many of you have confidence in
[3:35:20] him?
[3:35:21] &gt;&gt; I know he can help us.
[3:35:26] &gt;&gt; There's people in this room that have
[3:35:27] been through so much together.
[3:35:30] We know each other's stuff and we love
[3:35:33] each other anyway. Don't you let some
[3:35:36] little something rise up among you and
[3:35:38] cause you to be at odds with one
[3:35:39] another.
[3:35:40] &gt;&gt; You're in the vessel of
[3:35:42] misunderstanding, you don't have to stay
[3:35:44] there forever. God bless you. You maybe
[3:35:48] because my glasses are so dirty, but you
[3:35:51] all look so beautiful.
[3:35:53] You just shine.
[3:35:56] You just shine. You've been scoured. I
[3:35:58] pray
[3:36:00] you're dismissed to go in the name of
[3:36:01] the Lord. Watch how they don't obey me.
[3:36:04] Watch how they just tar.
[3:36:07] Please bring something back so these
[3:36:09] visitors can have a good meal to eat
[3:36:11] today. Let's sing as they go out. I'm
[3:36:14] one of them. Benjamin, I don't have a
[3:36:16] lot of voice here, but help me.

[3:36:37] fire that fell at Pentecost.
