TRANSCRIPT
========================================
i form the light create darkness i make peace and create evil i the lord do all these things what good reason could god possibly have in creating darkness and evil [Music] why would he do such a thing you see we have grown up in a world in a society in an environment that is constantly focused on this thought that a good god would only allow good things to all people and when we come down to crisis and when we have to deal with stuff people ask the age-old question why do bad things happen to good people there's no answer that's going to satisfy everybody but i know a verse that will shut you up i form the light create darkness i make peace and create evil i the lord do all these things we could almost hear god saying at the end it's really none of your business i'm working something you can't see just yet i'm doing something bigger than you are i'm pulling something together that you know not of because i'm god he's not a god who's defeated by his enemy he's not a god who's thrown off by circumstances or decisions or votes of men he's a god that knows his will he knows what he means he means what he says it's not a perfect world our circumstances are not perfect but our god is perfect and he's working a work in us getting us ready for an hour that there will be such courage such strength that you would be able to look the enemy right in the eye and say i will not i cannot i must not deny my lord we've got to be trained to serve a good god and to love him with everything we have all capacity we've got to love him more than anything else and we i want you to know something his praises have to continually be in our mouth because if his praises are not continually be in our mouth our bellyaching will override our praise our complaining will override our praise that's why we've got to make a conscious effort to discipline ourselves to praise god in the good times and in the bad times in the times we understand his plan in the times we don't understand his plan he's still god he's still god and so the lord our shepherd the good shepherd the creator of all things uses our enemies our circumstances that are adverse to correct us and to keep us in line not because he despises us but because he adores us and we are struggling in time god is functioning from eternity and reaching into time but how many of you know there's an hour that time can no longer be measured time will be no more and only eternity will remain and in eternity what looks so terrible here in eternity looks like just another rung on the ladder to get us closer to him aren't you glad god doesn't listen to the emotional cry of man he listens to my heart my mind says i can't take another moment but my heart says don't turn loose of me lord until you have molded me and shaped me and made me the overcomer i was born to be my mind says oh god i can't take any more but my heart says please lord don't leave me alone stay with me don't take your hand off of me squeeze me i tell you the devil could not accomplish one single thing had he not been created and picked up and placed in service for his creator now you tell me if you think god is going to let the ax boast himself against the one who holds the axe you think god's going to let the hammer get the last word not in not in the life of israel as a nation and not in our lives as children of the most high god no sir he is not going to allow your enemy to have the final boast you are bought with a price it's the truth it's the truth you
