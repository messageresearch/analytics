[0:00] Samson was born for a purpose. God
[0:04] vindicated his purpose by a supernatural
[0:07] announcement. And God also vindicated
[0:10] that he had a divine purpose by moving
[0:14] on him violently,
[0:17] mightily. The spirit of the Lord would
[0:20] move on him and he would immediately
[0:24] transcend
[0:26] his natural strength and ability. God
[0:29] giving him a strength that was of
[0:31] another world, of another realm, of
[0:34] another dimension. Samson not only makes
[0:37] a beautiful type of our Lord, he makes a
[0:40] beautiful type of an end time bride, a
[0:43] remnant church, because he's flawed,
[0:47] number one. So, I can relate to flawed
[0:50] folk in the Bible. But I like the fact
[0:53] that he didn't lose the purpose of his
[0:55] birth because he was flawed. God's hand
[0:58] stayed on him. And God said, "I'm going
[1:00] to use him.
[1:02] &gt;&gt; I I I I don't know whether to fully
[1:05] trust him or not, but I'm going to use
[1:06] him because he's available." DID YOU
[1:10] KNOW GOD IS NOT JUST looking for
[1:12] somebody who's qualified to do a
[1:14] particular thing? He's looking for
[1:17] SOMEBODY WHO'S WILLING.
[1:19] &gt;&gt; You You know, it's not your amen that
[1:22] that testifies that you're willing. It's
[1:25] your obedience. It's how quickly you
[1:28] move to make adjustment to change your
[1:32] direction and to surrender to the
[1:35] leadership of the Holy Spirit.
[1:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38] &gt;&gt; There is going to be a mark that is
[1:41] going to be easily identifiable on an
[1:46] end time Bible believing bride. And one
[1:50] of those marks, we could call it that,
[1:53] is going to be integrity.
[1:55] And no wonder the bride of every other
[1:58] age is going to marvel that you and I
[2:02] made it out of Leodysia,
[2:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:05] &gt;&gt; With our character intact because we
[2:08] yielded to his life.
[2:10] &gt;&gt; They're going to stand around and say,
[2:11] "YOU MEAN YOU'VE COME OUT of Leodysia?
[2:14] Why, that's the most wicked of all the
[2:16] ages. There's going to be a certainly a
[2:20] stir in eternity when you cross because
[2:24] the spirit of this age is so it's so
[2:29] wicked.
[2:31] &gt;&gt; It's so self centered.
[2:36] &gt;&gt; And
[2:38] Jesus was the opposite. Amen.
[2:41] &gt;&gt; The most loving, the most forgiving,
[2:44] the most sacrificial,
[2:47] the most unselfish life
[2:51] &gt;&gt; that the world has ever seen.
[2:53] &gt;&gt; And so to be like Jesus
[2:56] doesn't mean to say hallelujah, praise
[2:58] the Lord, amen, every other sentence.
[3:01] Amen.
[3:01] &gt;&gt; To be like Jesus means live like him,
[3:04] talk like him, walk like him, tell the
[3:07] truth like him.
[3:09] &gt;&gt; Love, love, love,
[3:13] love like him.
[3:16] &gt;&gt; Speak with integrity, with courage, but
[3:20] with a life that backs up what we say.
[3:25] &gt;&gt; And I WANT TO THROW MYSELF ON THE MERCY
[3:29] OF YOUR WORD. HALLELUJAH. IT IT'S A FIRE
[3:33] THAT consumes and BURNS OUT. IT'S A
[3:36] HAMMER THAT CRUSHES OUR own stubborn
[3:39] will when we continue to submit
[3:41] ourselves to the Lord. I'm standing
[3:44] today in a church full of Samsons. ARE
[3:46] YOU SAYING FAILURES? I DON'T SEE SAMSON
[3:50] as a failure.
[3:52] I SEE HIM AS A HUMAN
[3:55] &gt;&gt; BORN WITH A VISION, BORN WITH A PURPOSE,
[3:57] BORN FOR A CAUSE, but a human.
[4:01] &gt;&gt; And when he fell, HE HAD TO PICK HIMSELF
[4:04] UP.
[4:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[4:07] &gt;&gt; When he went to the vineyard, HE HAD TO
[4:08] CORRECT HIS PATH. And you and I will
[4:11] have to do the same thing in this hour
[4:14] or it's not ONLY RELATIONSHIPS WE'LL
[4:16] LOSE.
[4:17] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[4:18] &gt;&gt; IT'S OUR ETERNITY.
