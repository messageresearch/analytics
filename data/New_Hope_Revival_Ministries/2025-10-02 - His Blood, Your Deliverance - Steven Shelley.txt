Description:
A picture emerges of spiritual awakening—where we once looked in the mirror expecting to see our shortcomings, we now find Christ's perfection reflecting back. This shift marks a transition from the old age into a new kingdom order, one built not with brick and mortar but with transformed lives.
At the heart lies a gentle but serious invitation: the price has been paid, the blood cries out, and deliverance waits to be embraced. The question isn't whether freedom is available, but whether we'll reach out and take hold of what's already ours.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
We're blessed today &gt;&gt; because God set an order in the old covenant. He fulfilled in reality that order in the new covenant. And today as we walk in the outer skirts of the kingdom, we're coming into kingdom and we can see the kingdom. It's so close that by eyes of faith and spirit, we can see the kingdom. We're nearly there. I'm not talking about heaven. I'm talking about a new government, &gt;&gt; a new spiritual order, &gt;&gt; and we're closer than we've ever been before. There is no time for playing around. But we have to get a goal, a vision, something in front of our eyes that we can look to in the spirit because what you look to in the spirit is what you become in in in reality. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; We're not gazing any longer through a dark glass. No, &gt;&gt; we're not looking at Jesus anymore through the lattice. &gt;&gt; But the bridegroom has stepped out from behind the lattice &gt;&gt; and the and the mirror is clear. We went to the mirror expecting to see our sin. &gt;&gt; We went to the mirror expecting to see where we had aired from the from the instruction of God. But because of the unveiling, because of the apocalypsis, &gt;&gt; because Jesus now stands in full view, the word has been revealed. &gt;&gt; And because of that, when we went to the mirror expecting to see how far short we were, we saw another image. &gt;&gt; We saw something else in the mirror. &gt;&gt; We saw his perfection. &gt;&gt; We saw his blessed face. &gt;&gt; And we realized our only hope was to look unto that. look to that, look unto that until we become that. &gt;&gt; And so the the hour of seeing our transgression in the mirror, that's finished. &gt;&gt; And now we're seeing perfection there. &gt;&gt; Not ours. &gt;&gt; His not our righteousness, &gt;&gt; his &gt;&gt; not our perfe. &gt;&gt; Not our worthiness. his. &gt;&gt; He has made a way for you and I to get out of Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride is pulling herself through the last little hold of Leodysia. Just the last one. Just the last one. The only hold Leodysia has on you would be in that mind, will, and emotion realm and flesh realm. But you're pulling unto Christ. And the more we pull unto him, the less hold that the spirit of the age of Leodysia can have on any of us. And the kingdom starts pulling us on. Somebody say, "I feel the pull." &gt;&gt; What is the pull? It's a kingdom pull. &gt;&gt; It's a pull to take us out of the of the closing hours of the spirit of the age, Leodysia, and to place us in kingdom. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh Jesus talks about this kingdom and he's been building it a long time. And it's not built with brick and mortar. It's not built with 2x4s and hammers. It's built a holy habitation. It's a It's built with lively stones. &gt;&gt; It's built with those things that have been resuscitated and resurrected by the spirit of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Once we were dead. Once we were dead. Once we had no hope. Once we had no power against sin. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Sin ruled. Sin reigned in us. &gt;&gt; We didn't have time to think about the world. All we knew is that sin was ruling in us. But thanks be to God. &gt;&gt; Thanks be to God. He made the way. &gt;&gt; He not only made the way, he became the way. &gt;&gt; The one who knows. The one who matters the most &gt;&gt; is the one who knows it all. There is a protocol. I'm preaching now. There is a protocol &gt;&gt; to enter into the holy. &gt;&gt; The saddest part of all of this is it's done. The price is paid. The blood is there. &gt;&gt; And if we don't utilize and appropriate, if we don't take the power and authority of that blood and appropriate it in every area of our life, it's not his fault. Come on. &gt;&gt; It's not even the preacher's fault. &gt;&gt; Oh, I know how people love that. &gt;&gt; It's our own fault. &gt;&gt; The blood cries out. The blood of Jesus Christ. The blood that God created &gt;&gt; for the full deliverance of mankind. It cries out. &gt;&gt; Hear it. &gt;&gt; You can do it. Go forward. &gt;&gt; Take it. &gt;&gt; Possess it. &gt;&gt; Apply it. Appropriate it. Don't waste it. &gt;&gt; Don't devalue it. &gt;&gt; Get your help. Get your deliverance.
