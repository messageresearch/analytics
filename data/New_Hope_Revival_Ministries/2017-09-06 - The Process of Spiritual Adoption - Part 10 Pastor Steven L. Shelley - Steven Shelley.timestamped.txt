[0:50] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen
[0:53] Shelley and you're watching the Eagles
[0:55] cry I want to welcome you to part 10 of
[0:58] a series that we've been doing over the
[1:02] last few weeks on the process of
[1:06] spiritual adoption and I need to end it
[1:09] but I haven't finished it we're gonna do
[1:12] one more today and and I might have to
[1:15] come back and do a few more at some
[1:18] point but I want to say what a blessing
[1:21] it is to be able to come to you and
[1:23] share this way I'm a preacher and I
[1:26] normally do my preaching in the pulpit
[1:29] and but I so enjoy being able to sit
[1:32] behind this little desk and just speak
[1:34] to you from my heart and let you know
[1:36] that we love you and we're doing what we
[1:38] do it's small I recognize that but we're
[1:41] doing what we do because we love to
[1:44] share the revelation truth from God's
[1:46] Word in this hour it's such a delight to
[1:49] see and to know that God is preparing a
[1:52] people and those people are about to
[1:54] emerge with the fullness of the Word of
[1:58] God in their lives and we're going to
[2:00] see a harvest a harvest of harvesters
[2:03] first and then those harvesters are
[2:06] going to be loosed for a quick short
[2:08] time into the harvest fields and there's
[2:11] going to be deliverance and salvation
[2:13] and strongholds of false religion are
[2:17] going to be broken and people are going
[2:19] to come I just prophesy that there's
[2:22] going to be an awakening that vales are
[2:24] going to be lifted and scales are going
[2:27] to fall off of people's eyes and there's
[2:29] going to be a great host of people who
[2:32] see the beauty of the Lord Jesus Yeshua
[2:35] who have never seen him before and to
[2:38] have even the smallest part of that it's
[2:40] a great blessing to us would you look on
[2:43] the screen and see the contact
[2:45] information and let us know that you're
[2:48] watching this program if you've got
[2:49] prayer requests feel free to send them
[2:52] in and we will join with you in prayer
[2:54] believing that God will answer your need
[2:57] I want us to get right into the study
[2:59] today we're going
[3:01] look to the scripture in the book of
[3:02] first John and we're going to look at
[3:06] chapter three and see some interesting
[3:08] things there first John chapter 3
[3:11] beginning in verse one said behold what
[3:14] manner of love the father hath bestowed
[3:18] upon us
[3:19] now that word behold there means to
[3:22] focus and to see not just to look but to
[3:25] look with focus to look with intention
[3:28] and with purpose on the manner of love
[3:32] that the father has to be stoned
[3:35] bestowed upon us that we should be
[3:39] called the sons of God here we are again
[3:45] sonship adoption the manifestation of
[3:49] our relationship with him behold what
[3:53] manner of love the father hath bestowed
[3:55] upon us that we should be called the
[3:58] sons of God therefore the world knoweth
[4:01] us not because it knew him not verse 2
[4:06] beloved now are we the sons of God and
[4:10] it does not yet appear what we shall be
[4:14] but we know that when he shall appear we
[4:18] shall be like him for we shall see him
[4:23] as he is and every man that hath this
[4:27] hope in him purifies himself even as he
[4:32] is pure now so many people interpret
[4:36] that verse of scripture to say that we
[4:38] will not be like him until we see him
[4:42] and then we'll know who he is when he
[4:44] comes but I believe that that is not
[4:48] exactly what is being taught in this
[4:51] verse of scripture it does not yet
[4:53] appear what we shall be I believe that
[4:56] is speaking about the the end of our
[4:58] adoption the fullness of our
[5:00] relationship with Jesus Christ but we
[5:03] know that when he shall appear we shall
[5:06] be like him now some people believe that
[5:09] that means when he appears we're changed
[5:11] to become like him I believe that it
[5:14] means the
[5:14] torsed sons of the kingdom are going to
[5:16] meet him when he comes and were already
[5:20] going to have been transformed into his
[5:22] image because we have a physical coming
[5:26] that's what we're waiting on and we have
[5:29] the parousia coming of the Lord which is
[5:31] the coming in his presence and will with
[5:35] the fullness of his word that's what
[5:37] we're experiencing in this hour the Lord
[5:40] is coming in this hour he's coming in
[5:43] the fullness of his word he's coming
[5:45] with revelation he's coming to anoint
[5:48] our eyes with eyesalve that we can see
[5:51] the living reality of his truth but he's
[5:54] coming again in a physical body a
[5:57] glorified would mind you but he's coming
[5:59] to receive his bride unto himself so I
[6:03] believe there's a transformation that
[6:05] has to take place in the bridal company
[6:08] before the physical return of the Lord
[6:11] Jesus Christ you may be saying I've
[6:14] never heard that before in my life
[6:15] search the scriptures I invite you to
[6:18] dig and search through the scripture and
[6:21] see if you cannot see the evidence that
[6:25] we're going to be changed that God is
[6:29] going to manifest himself that's what
[6:31] all of creation has been groaning for
[6:33] and longing for for so many years as we
[6:37] read about in Romans chapter 8 and I
[6:40] believe that that's what's beginning to
[6:42] happen right now hallelujah and that's
[6:45] exciting that is such good news in a
[6:48] world that is filled with such bad news
[6:51] gloomy news and dark news economic some
[6:56] people say economic downturn but I think
[7:00] it's it's becoming in some places closer
[7:03] to economic failure and you can get your
[7:06] eyes on those things and get caught up
[7:08] in politics and the stock market and
[7:11] investments and and I'm telling you you
[7:14] can have a nervous breakdown well I mean
[7:17] the newspapers are full of people who
[7:19] take their own lives because they've
[7:21] lost their retirement and so forth but
[7:24] you as believers I'm speaking to you as
[7:27] a belief
[7:28] you've got to put your hope and your
[7:30] trust and your confidence in the Lord
[7:32] Jesus Christ and remember what David
[7:35] said I'm an old man and I've never seen
[7:38] the righteous forsaken nor the seed of
[7:40] God begging for bread in other words God
[7:42] will always come through if he has to
[7:45] send the Raven for you like he did for
[7:47] Elijah to feed you somebody said well
[7:49] where did the where did the Ravens get
[7:51] that food well I don't know if they got
[7:53] it off with somebody's window seal or if
[7:56] they got it supernaturally and it was
[7:58] created by God but but regardless of
[8:01] that fact the Prophet was fed he was
[8:03] taken care of and you and I are going to
[8:06] be taken care of by the grace of the
[8:08] Lord Jesus Christ no matter how bad
[8:11] things get in fact we're going to be
[8:13] used in mighty ways when the world is in
[8:16] such a sad shape and in such a needy
[8:19] predicament they're going to look for
[8:21] help and you and I are going to be able
[8:23] to provide the spiritual assistance
[8:26] that's needed for those who have no hope
[8:29] we're going to be able to give them hope
[8:31] not religion not just Church anity but
[8:35] we're going to be able to give them
[8:36] something with some substance we're
[8:38] going to be able to give them a part of
[8:40] the divine nature of Jesus Christ that
[8:42] we have at that point will be manifested
[8:46] in our lives so let me read that one
[8:49] more time Kenneth beloved now are we the
[8:51] sons of God now I need to mention that
[8:55] that word sons is tecnine that we've
[8:58] talked about before which means puberty
[9:01] adolescence beloved now are we the
[9:07] how it appears in King James it says
[9:09] sons of God but in other translations
[9:12] they picked up on the fact that that's
[9:14] teknon and they have said children of
[9:17] God meaning adolescents teenagers
[9:20] beloved now are we teenagers in God and
[9:23] it does not yet appear what we shall be
[9:26] it is not yet manifested that we're
[9:29] going to come to a place of maturity
[9:32] that's beyond the age of teenage years
[9:36] under and the responsibility level of
[9:39] being a teenager but we
[9:41] know that when he shall appear we shall
[9:43] be like him so I believe let me say this
[9:47] again I believe that it's his appearance
[9:49] his parousia coming that's going to
[9:52] cause us to be like him so that when he
[9:55] comes physically to receive his bride
[9:57] we're already going to be like him and
[10:00] so we're going to know him because we're
[10:02] going to be exactly like him in His
[10:05] image with his character all this
[10:09] soulish stuff dealt with and we're going
[10:12] to be walking as the manifestation of
[10:14] the Living Word of God in the earth
[10:16] somebody said that's that's about the
[10:19] most far-out thing I've ever heard well
[10:21] I invite you one more time see what the
[10:23] Bible said don't take my word for it or
[10:27] anybody else's word search God's word
[10:29] and see if the Lord hasn't promised some
[10:32] pretty amazing things for those days
[10:35] just prior just preceding the days of
[10:39] his physical return some amazing things
[10:42] yes they're dark things and bleak things
[10:44] and ugly things going on but it's like
[10:47] we mentioned many times before Charles
[10:49] Dickens when he wrote A Tale of Two
[10:51] Cities he begins that classic book by
[10:54] saying it was the best of times it was
[10:57] the worst of times so in in the world
[11:00] and those who have no hope in the Savior
[11:02] and in the Messiah they're going to be
[11:04] experiencing the worst days the world
[11:06] has ever known but the bride the remnant
[11:09] of God's people we're going to be
[11:11] experiencing some of the greatest days
[11:13] that perhaps greater than what we've
[11:16] we've ever known for sure and maybe
[11:19] greater than than what's ever been
[11:21] manifested in human history I can say
[11:24] that because it's not just going to be
[11:27] two or three here and two or three there
[11:28] but there's going to be a whole company
[11:30] of believers that are raised up now my
[11:32] time is already slipping away really
[11:35] quick and we're going to just sort of
[11:36] review now these we're not going to talk
[11:40] about circumcision we've covered that
[11:42] quite well that that place of infancy
[11:45] but we're going to just real quickly
[11:47] review that that teknon that teenage
[11:51] stage and then we're going to finish up
[11:53] again by talking one more
[11:55] time about the adult place of maturity
[11:58] the believer is also referred to as that
[12:02] teknon that greek word which is a child
[12:05] and we see that many times for instance
[12:09] in John 1:12 and I mentioned that the
[12:12] last time we were together - as many as
[12:14] received him to them gave he the power
[12:16] to be the sons of God that speaks about
[12:20] that level of the maturity of a teenager
[12:24] but the believer is also in union with
[12:27] Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is called a
[12:30] mature son that word huse is used
[12:34] referring to the Lord Jesus Christ as a
[12:37] mature son
[12:38] so in union with him we are then called
[12:42] to be adult sons as well and so that is
[12:48] our highest calling although we may be
[12:50] in that in that baby stage of the word
[12:53] brephos in Greek or we may be in that
[12:56] adolescent stage but potentially we have
[13:00] been called to be a mature son to the
[13:04] people living in the predominantly Greek
[13:06] enrollment culture of the 1st century AD
[13:09] that word here theisha
[13:12] would bring to mind a ceremony that that
[13:16] evolved from the Greek and Roman culture
[13:18] called the toga virilis and it was a
[13:22] ceremony in which a 14 year old boy
[13:24] would go through a ceremony of investor
[13:30] with adult male members of his family
[13:33] and at this ceremony there would be
[13:35] speeches made by his father and uncles
[13:38] and other male relatives that would
[13:41] challenge the young man and offerings
[13:44] would be made to the gods and then the
[13:46] boy would stand in the center of the
[13:49] group and take off this a garment of a
[13:53] child that he had always worn and he
[13:55] would be given a new robe or the toga of
[14:00] an adult and this would be placed on him
[14:04] and this was called the toga virilis
[14:06] which means the road
[14:08] of a man so we see this process sort of
[14:13] ceremony in other cultures and so we
[14:16] believe that there was probably some
[14:20] influence on on the Jewish culture that
[14:24] as the Romans occupied the land and as
[14:28] Greek influence became so strong that
[14:31] this is probably where this little
[14:33] ceremony developed in Hebrew culture
[14:36] where as a twelve year old in in the
[14:39] other culture about fourteen but in the
[14:41] Hebrew culture it was when the son was
[14:44] announced to be a full Apprentice of the
[14:48] father to train it probably came some
[14:53] way from this toga virilis so you can
[14:56] see that this was in many cultures and
[14:58] now in the Hebrew faith in the Jewish
[15:01] faith it has developed all the way down
[15:03] to the to the bar mitzvah of course that
[15:06] young man whether he was 12 in one
[15:08] culture or 14 in another culture he was
[15:11] not mature enough or wise enough to
[15:14] exercise all of the privileges that he
[15:18] had and he was certainly not experienced
[15:21] enough in life to live up to all the
[15:23] responsibilities that would eventually
[15:25] be placed on him but the seriousness of
[15:29] his position as a citizen was sort of
[15:33] impressed on him in this little ceremony
[15:36] and if he was intelligent and
[15:39] hardworking and consistent he would then
[15:42] of course grow up to be an adult having
[15:46] integrity and character and there would
[15:49] be another celebration of that milestone
[15:51] in his life in explaining how we
[15:54] interpret the term from the scripture
[15:57] that we started off with in Romans 8 the
[16:00] manifestation of the sons of God perhaps
[16:02] we should use a bit of clarification on
[16:05] that term because what did Greek
[16:08] speaking people such as Paul mean when
[16:11] they said something was to be manifested
[16:15] well as you've heard me mention not
[16:17] necessarily reading it from a notes as
[16:19] I'm doing
[16:20] but you've heard me mention in this
[16:22] study that that original Greek word is
[16:26] apocalypsis and it means a disclosure in
[16:31] other places throughout the New
[16:32] Testament that word is also translated
[16:36] as an appearing a coming to shine light
[16:40] on or a revelation the definition
[16:43] assigned to the root word is to take off
[16:46] the cover so here we kind of see that
[16:49] concept in this toga virilis ceremony
[16:53] where the the the robe of a child the
[16:58] age-specific garb of a child was removed
[17:04] and and the age-specific robe of an
[17:07] adult man was put on him when I hear
[17:11] that term apocalypsis or apocalypsis
[17:15] is probably a little bit more accurate
[17:17] it means to me the the act of exposing
[17:24] something that has been previously
[17:26] hidden from view so if God says you're
[17:30] coming and through the scripture if he
[17:32] says to us through the Apostle the the
[17:35] manifestation of the sons of God it
[17:37] means that God's been working on
[17:39] something behind the scenes guess what
[17:41] it's me it's you he's been working on us
[17:45] he's been dealing with us as we've
[17:48] talked about every trial we've gone
[17:50] through every both the low places and
[17:53] the high places the valleys and the
[17:56] mountains the hardships and the seasons
[17:59] of blessing and abundance it's all been
[18:02] a part of God's plan to work on us as
[18:05] his masterpiece because there's coming a
[18:07] day that he's gonna take off the cover
[18:10] and he's going to show the world his
[18:13] mature sons that which has been in
[18:16] darkness that which has been in
[18:19] obscurity will be brought out into
[18:22] visibility it has been stated by some
[18:27] that what we're really looking for is
[18:29] not a manifestation of the sons of God
[18:31] but a manifestation of
[18:33] God in his sons and I believe that that
[18:38] is pretty accurate this is basically a
[18:42] difference of perspective
[18:43] for instance we often call the the book
[18:46] of the Bible that's right after the four
[18:48] Gospels we often call that the Acts of
[18:52] the Apostles but it's really not about
[18:55] what the Apostles did is it it's about
[18:58] what the Holy Spirit did in the lives of
[19:01] the Apostles so the emphasis is not on
[19:04] the sons of God being manifested the
[19:07] emphasis must be on God being manifested
[19:11] through his sons how many of you want to
[19:13] make God a vessel you you want to
[19:16] prepare your life as a vessel as a
[19:19] pipeline so that God can come and
[19:23] manifest himself in the fullness of his
[19:26] glory through your life I believe that's
[19:30] many people's desire that that you are
[19:34] watching this program right now and and
[19:37] whatever manner you're singing and
[19:39] whatever media method you're watching
[19:43] this program I believe I'm speaking
[19:45] maybe even on a DVD for that matter many
[19:48] people who are watching this your
[19:49] deepest desire is to be a yielded vessel
[19:53] in the hand of the Lord and and I really
[19:56] believe that God is bringing us to that
[19:58] place he's sort of pulling us and and
[20:01] drawing us so that we want to yield
[20:03] ourselves more to him now that was the
[20:06] toga virilis which was compared to the
[20:10] time of being celebrated as an
[20:14] apprentice of the father now in closing
[20:16] this today bringing it to an end at
[20:19] least for now I want to look one more
[20:21] time at that other ceremony the one that
[20:24] took place about the age of 30 that
[20:27] would be the son placement and the
[20:29] ceremony went something like this I'm
[20:31] gonna just read it from my notes once
[20:33] the son had finally come to age the
[20:36] father would arrange a ceremony for him
[20:39] and that means he had passed the test he
[20:42] had been under the governor's he had
[20:44] been under the tutors he had proven
[20:46] himself accountable
[20:47] he had proven himself trustworthy so the
[20:50] father would arrange a ceremony for him
[20:52] in a part of the city that would draw
[20:54] the largest possible number of observers
[20:57] usually in that time around the main
[20:59] gates of the city or alternatively in
[21:03] the marketplace amidst a great crowd of
[21:06] witnesses he would then place his hands
[21:08] upon the head of his son and he would
[21:11] initiate the impartation of power now
[21:15] that's very very interesting and I could
[21:18] preach on that if I had time I've just
[21:21] glanced at the clock and I don't have a
[21:23] lot of time to go into the impartation
[21:25] of the father's authority but just think
[21:27] about the biblical implication and the
[21:30] spiritual implication of that he would
[21:33] speak to the crowd of his sons
[21:35] commitment throughout the course of his
[21:38] training his apprenticeship and then he
[21:41] would confirm that his son was now
[21:44] willing and able and ready to accept the
[21:48] responsibilities that were about to be
[21:51] conferred upon him or imparted to him he
[21:55] would grant him the authority publicly
[21:57] to speak in his stead and would call
[22:01] upon all who were there to be witnesses
[22:05] that day and to bear record that from
[22:08] that time forward his son would go forth
[22:12] from that ceremony in his father's name
[22:16] think about that no longer was his son
[22:20] to be looked upon as merely an heir
[22:24] under tutors and governors but he was
[22:27] now recognized as the inheritor think
[22:31] about that the inheritor of all that his
[22:35] father had promised him and an equal
[22:38] partner in the family business he was
[22:40] not an apprentice anymore he was not in
[22:43] training anymore he had proven himself
[22:45] and he was now to be a partner in the
[22:49] family business you just think about the
[22:51] fact that we're coming to that place of
[22:54] maturity in the placing of a mature son
[22:57] and where we are becoming partners in
[23:00] the family
[23:01] business where where we could have said
[23:03] like Jesus sent us as a young man to his
[23:05] parents I'm about my father's business
[23:08] think about it and he and his father
[23:10] were one it meant that either one of
[23:13] them could conduct the full business of
[23:15] the family and this this speaks about
[23:19] the oneness that Jesus had with the
[23:21] father but it also speaks about the
[23:23] Union and the oneness that you and I are
[23:25] called to in this last day as part of
[23:28] the Bride of Christ
[23:29] finally to seal the deal so to speak the
[23:32] father would utter these now familiar
[23:34] words this is my beloved Son in whom I
[23:38] am well pleased
[23:39] the exact words that three of the Gospel
[23:42] writers have told us that were spoken
[23:45] over Jesus at his baptism and three of
[23:48] the Gospel writers have told us that
[23:50] these words were spoken over him on the
[23:53] Mount of Transfiguration that's exactly
[23:55] the words that a father would pronounce
[23:57] publicly over his son during this time
[24:00] of adoption this pronouncement would let
[24:04] everyone know that the son had received
[24:07] the full blessing and the full
[24:09] endorsement of his father I believe
[24:11] that's about to take place in the earth
[24:13] I believe that this people that God's
[24:15] been working on all these years he's
[24:18] about to to come in the fullness of his
[24:21] glory and announced to the world I now
[24:24] have a bridal company in the earth who
[24:26] are going to be functioning in oneness
[24:28] with me and they're going to be
[24:30] authorized and have the authority to
[24:33] conduct my business on the earth in a
[24:37] manner that the world has yet to see I
[24:39] had an experience in closing I don't
[24:42] know if I have time or not but a few
[24:44] weeks ago I had an experience in a sort
[24:47] of a revelatory realm where I saw what
[24:50] happened on the Mount of Transfiguration
[24:52] I saw the Lord Jesus Yeshua standing
[24:56] there I saw Moses and Elijah I even saw
[24:59] Peter James and John I saw how the cloud
[25:02] came down how they entered into the
[25:03] cloud I heard the voice speaking this is
[25:07] my beloved son I'm pleased with him hear
[25:11] him hear ye
[25:13] him and then all of a sudden I saw
[25:16] something beyond what we read about in
[25:19] the Gospels
[25:20] I saw a veil that I had not seen before
[25:24] like a deep curtain that had been behind
[25:28] the Lord Jesus and I had not seen that
[25:31] before I just watched the whole thing
[25:33] play out and I'd not seen that curtain
[25:36] all of a sudden I saw the curtain and it
[25:39] lifted the veil literally literally was
[25:42] lifted up from behind him and there was
[25:45] a great crowd of people standing behind
[25:49] him and the voice spoke again this is my
[25:52] beloved son in whom I'm pleased hear ye
[25:55] him this time I knew by revelation that
[26:00] the phrase here--he him was not just
[26:04] referring to the Lord Jesus
[26:06] it was referring to them it could have
[26:09] been said although it was said here he
[26:13] him he was now referring to the
[26:16] corporate voice of God speaking through
[26:21] the body of mature sons those who had
[26:25] come to full adoption and now the veil
[26:30] apocalypsis would be taken off and they
[26:33] would be revealed to the world with the
[26:36] authority of God in their mouth it was a
[26:39] life-changing and encouraging experience
[26:43] to be able to see that and I believe
[26:46] that's where we are and we've got to
[26:49] continue to remain humble before the
[26:51] Lord and walk softly before him in being
[26:55] sober and being vigilant and we need to
[26:59] let the Lord come and manifest the
[27:00] fullness of who he is
[27:01] in us so that we can speak the word and
[27:05] see God perform it not selfishly
[27:08] but for the body of Christ they're
[27:09] desperate cases they're desperate
[27:12] situations where we need a full
[27:14] manifestation of the glory of God and
[27:17] God wants to use you and he wants to use
[27:20] me let's pray together father I thank
[27:23] you for letting us come this far and
[27:25] sometime in the future
[27:27] we'll come back and and do some other
[27:29] teaching but I think that somehow by
[27:31] your grace you have used us to lay a
[27:34] pretty good foundation for at least what
[27:36] the process is about and I pray that you
[27:39] will use these words to bless your
[27:41] people and to cause them to hunger and
[27:45] thirst for more of you in a place of
[27:48] intimate fellowship and relationship
[27:50] with you the enemy so despises that but
[27:54] we in the body longed for it
[27:56] grant it to us in the name of Yeshua the
[27:59] Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen
[28:01] thank you for being a faithful watcher
[28:04] of this program and I pray that you'll
[28:06] tune in again next time I don't know
[28:08] what will be speaking about but I pray
[28:10] it'll be something that you need for
[28:12] that time in your life thank you for
[28:14] watching the Eagles cry bye bye for now
[28:18] [Music]
[28:48] you
