TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you cannot let the enemy's accusation go unanswered shake yourself from the dust arise and sit down or Jerusalem loose yourself from the bonds of your neck o captive daughter of Zion that was his daughter she was the daughter of Zion she was the queen of Zion a princess of the King and yet she called out and there was no man nobody no woman no neighbour to answer her call it was a divine setter God was about to reveal something to her he was about to tell her the expiration on your experience is running out and deliverance is in your mouth and deliverance is in your hand and deliverance will begin when you get up but how many of you know this was an invitation get up above the dust forget where you been forget about how you've been violated you've been abused you've been raped you've been beaten you've been forsaken nobody had compassion on you nobody stopped to help you now you're getting help the voice has come to you the word has come to you you got to see that this is a message from God to you you cannot let the enemy's accusation go unanswered you cannot let the enemy's life go unanswered if you do you'll form a habit and that habit will become a rut and that rut will become a grave and you'll find it very difficult to get out and it doesn't have to be that way and in that process you plunge yourself from the perfect will of God into a prolonged season of his permissive will what he allows instead of what he prefers she didn't need a saw to cut the chain she just need to be obedient to the voice because to her surprise when she got up guess what the band around her neck fell off the chain that held her was broken and she was free but guess what she had been free it was a bit of a bond that was unlocked a chain that was already loose and all she had to do was get up but she couldn't because she allowed that to become her identity you will arise you will arise and you will sit down in a new identity in a new position in a new place from slave to the daughter of Zion from captive daughter to freed daughter
