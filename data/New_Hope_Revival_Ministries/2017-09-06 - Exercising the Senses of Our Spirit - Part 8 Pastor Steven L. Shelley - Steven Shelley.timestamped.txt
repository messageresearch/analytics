[1:02] Lord Jesus Christ he is the same
[1:05] yesterday today and forever he's doing
[1:09] great and mighty things among his people
[1:12] here in the end time and I considered a
[1:15] great privilege to be a part of God's

[1:20] he desires to do in the earth I invite
[1:23] you to contact our ministry all of the

[1:27] the screen we would love to hear from
[1:30] you we'd love to join with you in faith
[1:32] over any prayer requests that you might

[1:36] something that the Lord is done in your
[1:38] life a great testimony we'd love to hear
[1:41] that as well we'd love to be a service
[1:43] to you in any way that we can we take
[1:46] prayer serious and we take prayer
[1:48] requests serious and we pray over them
[1:51] each and every one and I just believe
[1:54] that there's such a season of open
[1:57] heavens I I really feel the favor of God
[2:01] on on what we're doing what what we're
[2:03] seeing happening right now it just feels
[2:06] like the blessing and the favor of god
[2:09] that's being poured out in many places
[2:12] around the world I'm thankful for the
[2:14] gospel channel I'm thankful for angel TV
[2:17] I'm thankful for God allowing these
[2:20] networks to be out there to stream also
[2:23] over the Internet all the different ways
[2:25] that God is using to get his word out to
[2:28] the hungry people everywhere many don't
[2:31] know the Lord and this program goes into
[2:34] places where I might not ever be able to
[2:37] go physically but by the grace of God
[2:39] and by this technology we're able to
[2:42] beam it right down and I believe we get
[2:46] the reports we hear from people in all
[2:48] kinds of places
[2:50] God is doing something and we are just
[2:52] thankful for that and it's all over I
[2:54] mean things are happening in so many
[2:56] different places around the world and
[2:59] I'm just believing God for more now
[3:02] we've been studying and I want to get
[3:04] right back in to the study so let's look
[3:07] to God's Word today okay in John chapter
[3:11] 20 we are going to read as we went off
[3:15] the air I was going to read more I
[3:17] didn't have time I used up my time so i
[3:20] just read verse 22 we're talking about
[3:23] exercising the senses of the Spirit
[3:26] where we're believing that we read him
[3:30] the scripture that when Adam took on the
[3:34] sin of Eve also in the Garden of Eden
[3:37] the Bible said if you take of this fruit
[3:39] you're going to die we know that Adams
[3:41] body didn't die his soul didn't die but
[3:45] something in Adam died what was it it
[3:47] was his spirit life he lost his ability
[3:50] to function in the spirit realm he lost
[3:54] that communion that oneness with God his
[3:57] creator now we know that God was not
[3:59] going to let it always be that way so he
[4:02] had a plan a plan of redemption he came
[4:04] down walked in an earthly body of course
[4:06] first he gave the law he gave the law he
[4:09] gave the prophets he gave the the
[4:12] teachings the commandments and he called
[4:14] people into that kind of a fellowship
[4:16] the requiring of the blood of goats and
[4:20] bulls and lambs and then ultimately in
[4:23] the fullness of time God Almighty
[4:26] stepped down into the earth in a human
[4:29] body in the form of Yeshua the Lord
[4:32] Jesus Christ and he paid the price for
[4:34] my salvation and for your salvation and
[4:37] then by by the Holy Spirit this act of
[4:42] regeneration that we go through when we
[4:44] accept the Lord Jesus when we accept his
[4:47] forgiveness we accept his life and when
[4:51] he breathes into us there is a
[4:54] resurrection of our spirit life the
[4:58] spirit life that Adam had in the
[5:00] beginning but that was lost because of
[5:03] the fall
[5:04] now we're reading here in John chapter
[5:06] 20 the Lord Jesus has been crucified he
[5:10] has died he has raised from the dead and
[5:14] now he's already appeared to Mary and
[5:17] now let's let's pick up the story in
[5:20] verse 19 John 20 then the same day at
[5:24] evening being the first day of the week
[5:26] when the doors were shut where the
[5:28] disciples were assembled for fear of the
[5:30] Jews came Jesus and stood in the midst
[5:34] and saith unto them peace be unto you
[5:38] Shalom Shalom and when he had so sad he
[5:42] showed unto them his hands and his side
[5:45] then were the disciples glad when they
[5:49] saw the Lord when they recognized that
[5:52] this was the Lord then said Jesus to
[5:56] them again peace be unto you Shalom as
[5:59] my father hath sent me even so send I
[6:03] you as I have been sent I am now sending
[6:08] you and verse 22 is a powerful verse of
[6:12] scripture and when he had said this he
[6:15] breathed on them now that makes me want
[6:18] to just stop right there and pray Lord
[6:21] breathed on us breathe on your people
[6:24] release upon the earth the breath of the
[6:29] Living God and awaken the spirit man and
[6:33] the spirit life so that we as your
[6:37] children may be able to function again
[6:40] on both are in both the earthly realm
[6:44] and in the heavenly realm the spirit
[6:47] realm there's a whole dimension out
[6:49] there that we should be functioning in
[6:51] as spirit filled believers the realm of
[6:54] dreams and visions and visitations
[6:57] around where there is great angelic
[7:00] activity going on so many things are
[7:03] happening in the realm of the Spirit
[7:06] that you and I are supposed to be fully
[7:08] functioning in moving in and out of that
[7:12] realm as easy as we move in and out of
[7:15] the earthly realm that's where we're
[7:17] supposed to be
[7:18] we need something don't we need this
[7:21] resurrection life we need this breath of
[7:23] God breathed on us and when he has said
[7:26] this he breathed on them and said unto
[7:28] them receive ye the Holy Ghost are the
[7:31] Holy Spirit who so ever since you remit
[7:34] verse 23 they are emitted unto them and
[7:37] whosoever sins you retain they are
[7:39] retained now this is talking about by
[7:42] receiving the Holy Ghost by receiving
[7:44] the Holy Spirit you receive authority he
[7:48] gave unto them power he said Terry here
[7:51] in Jerusalem until you be endued with
[7:54] power power and authority to conduct the
[7:59] business of the father now this has
[8:03] happened if you're born again of the
[8:05] spirit of Jesus Christ then your spirit
[8:08] man has been resurrected and so you
[8:12] stand before your Creator today spirit
[8:15] soul and body the problem is our soul
[8:19] has been well exercised in fact it's
[8:23] been over stimulated because it's very
[8:25] easy for our soul to receive from this
[8:30] earthly environment and we talked about
[8:33] it we did a whole study and I I'm not
[8:35] going to bore you by going into all of
[8:37] that again but we talked about the
[8:39] doorways into the soul of man the the
[8:44] memory the imagination the conscious the
[8:48] affection and the reasonings all of
[8:50] these ways that the that the I want to
[8:54] say that the enemy but not just the
[8:56] enemy access is our soul but our soul is
[8:59] accessed through these doorways and the
[9:03] soul is very stimulated very entertained
[9:07] very carnal a lot of times although
[9:11] we've taught that the soul is not your
[9:13] enemy the way that you want to put
[9:15] things back into proper balance in your
[9:17] life is to exercise your spirit and the
[9:21] only way to exercise your spirit is to
[9:24] is to is to turn loose I know I said
[9:27] that three times didn't I I'm stuttering
[9:30] you just forgive me and let's move on
[9:31] okay the way to to come into that place
[9:36] is to lean into the things that God is
[9:41] trying to say to us and do for us in
[9:44] this hour try this go to bed tonight and
[9:49] before you go to sleep pray and say Lord
[9:53] Jesus I ask you to sanctify my dream
[9:57] life sanctify it I don't want evil
[10:01] dreams I don't want carnal dreams I
[10:03] don't want lustful dreams but I ask that
[10:06] you sanctify my mind and my thoughts and
[10:09] my dreams and that you speak to me in my
[10:14] dreams somebody said well that sounds
[10:17] like the New Age know it sounds like the
[10:19] Bible God has been speaking to man all
[10:22] through the scripture in dreams the
[10:26] enemy certainly likes to access us
[10:29] through dreams but God wants to speak to
[10:32] you through dreams and the more we learn
[10:35] to walk in our dual functionality
[10:39] functioning in the earthly realm
[10:40] functioning in the spirit realm then
[10:43] we're going to see our dreams speaking
[10:46] more directly to us God speaking more
[10:49] directly to us through our dreams I
[10:51] believe in vision I believe in open eye
[10:54] vision I believe the Lord can through
[10:56] your open I he can show you direction he
[10:59] can show you future events he can show
[11:02] you your destiny I believe in in in I
[11:08] I'm stuttering again I am so passionate
[11:13] about this subject that I have a hard
[11:16] time getting it out because I believe
[11:19] there's an invitation that's going out
[11:22] all over the world right now an
[11:24] invitation and God is saying don't you
[11:26] want to walk with me in communion like
[11:30] Adam don't you want me to come and have
[11:33] fellowship with you in the cool of the
[11:35] day don't you want to know and be
[11:39] constantly aware of my presence
[11:43] you're lying you know where most of us
[11:45] function today is we sometimes feel the
[11:48] spirit we sometimes feel the anointing
[11:51] we are sometimes aware of the presence
[11:54] of god but i believe that god wants us
[11:58] walking in something a whole lot more
[12:01] powerful than that i believe he wants us
[12:04] walking in a state of constant
[12:06] connection with the holy spirit this is
[12:10] what we're trying to create or stir up
[12:14] fertilize a hunger in you for because i
[12:18] believe it is so available and rarely
[12:22] accessed especially in our part my part
[12:27] of the world in the North American part
[12:30] of the world I think that many times in
[12:34] other parts of the world people walk in
[12:37] deeper places in the spirit I believe
[12:39] that's changing and and I believe it's
[12:42] going to change even more but the
[12:45] invitation is going out the door is open
[12:47] and God saying to you like he said to
[12:51] John come up I want to speak to you
[12:53] listen when we're walking in the realm
[12:55] of the Spirit even the word of God
[12:59] becomes new it becomes new because our
[13:02] soul is not getting everything and
[13:04] interpreting everything and sucking up
[13:06] everything but our spirit starts feeding
[13:09] on the word and the Holy Spirit starts
[13:12] taking the word quickening it making it
[13:15] alive I mean have you ever read a
[13:18] scripture over and over and over again
[13:19] and that's good yes that's good uh-huh
[13:21] that's good but then all of a sudden you
[13:23] read that same scripture at a time in
[13:25] your life when you need to hear God and
[13:28] it's like a light bulb goes off or a big
[13:30] spotlight comes down on a particular
[13:32] scripture and it's just made alive and
[13:35] quicker than you that's what we're
[13:37] talking about that's what we're talking
[13:40] about we're talking about the fullness
[13:42] and really that's like Jesus breathing
[13:45] on you and calling your spirit man to
[13:49] attention giving your spirit man full
[13:53] functionality again I believe that's
[13:55] where we're
[13:56] coming to when we repent of our sins and
[13:59] we invite and accept the Lord Jesus
[14:02] Christ to be our personal Savior we
[14:05] become born again like we read about in
[14:07] John where Nicodemus came and we read
[14:09] that we started off this series you must
[14:11] be born again born of the water and born
[14:14] of the Spirit when we are born again
[14:17] that part of us that has never fully
[14:21] functioned because of the fall our
[14:24] spirit man it comes to attention it is
[14:27] renewed it is resurrected and God says
[14:30] okay I'm going to have a connection with
[14:32] you that other people in the world don't
[14:34] have that's why the new age is so
[14:37] popular that's why witchcraft is so
[14:40] popular in all kinds of other forms of
[14:42] mysticism and so forth that are not
[14:45] biblically based it's because people are
[14:47] trying to contact the heavenly realm or
[14:50] the spirit realm and God's given you the
[14:53] ability to do that is a born-again
[14:54] believer and we're we're turning our
[14:57] faith loose in this hour and we're
[14:59] saying God we want your word we're in
[15:01] love with your word but we want it made
[15:02] alive and we want to hear from heaven
[15:05] and we won't clear direction and when
[15:08] we're walking in the mall or the market
[15:10] of the store and there's someone with a
[15:12] need we want the Spirit of God to
[15:14] quicken us and say now's the time we
[15:16] want to lay hands on somebody on the
[15:18] street corner and say be healed in the
[15:20] name of Jesus Christ and we not only
[15:22] want to do that we want God to honor it
[15:24] and we want to see them get up and this
[15:27] is happening in in token places all over
[15:31] the world but I believe there's a
[15:33] revival coming for the Bride of Christ
[15:35] where people wear where churches where
[15:40] ministries where young people especially
[15:43] particularly are going to be awakened in
[15:46] their spirit man and start walking in
[15:49] this place of oneness which will release
[15:53] to us a whole new realm of authority I'm
[15:56] telling you authority and if you want to
[15:59] read that again look at verse 22 and 23
[16:02] of John chapter 20 and see if that
[16:04] doesn't sound like some mighty powerful
[16:06] authority that Jesus released when he
[16:09] breathed on them
[16:10] so when we're born again that which Adam
[16:12] lost is restored in us and our spirit
[16:15] life is quickened and it begins to
[16:17] function on some level within us thank
[16:21] God for that John chapter 3 verse 6 and
[16:24] 7 that which is born of the flesh is
[16:26] flesh and that which is born of the
[16:28] Spirit is spirit jesus said Marvel not
[16:31] that I say unto you you must be born
[16:32] again but it is there's a process of
[16:36] maturity there's a process of spiritual
[16:38] growth and our spirit has to be
[16:40] exercised we have to learn how to
[16:43] exercise the senses of our spirit man
[16:46] making us more aware of the spirit realm
[16:49] we're very aware of the earthly realm
[16:52] but we want to become more aware of the
[16:54] spirit realm I know I'm just often
[16:56] saying things over and over again during
[16:57] this teaching but I want to say it so
[16:59] many different ways that you receive it
[17:02] and that you lean into it and that you
[17:04] pray about it until God makes it alive
[17:07] like first Peter chapter 2 verse 2 says
[17:09] as newborn babes and that's what we are
[17:13] when we're born again we're just like
[17:14] little babies learning to live learning
[17:17] to function learning to trust the Lord
[17:20] we still deal with our temper we still
[17:22] deal with our passions we still deal
[17:24] with things as newborn babes but we are
[17:27] sincerely desiring the milk of the word
[17:29] because by the milk of the word we grow
[17:32] we learn we mature and I preached to you
[17:36] I've taught right on this program that
[17:39] we have a word of promise from the Lord
[17:42] that there's going to be a release of
[17:45] accelerated maturity one has taken some
[17:48] 30 years to learn in the spirit learning
[17:52] hard knocks learning by suffering
[17:55] learning by obedience I believe there's
[17:58] going to be a new generation of
[17:59] champions raised up in this hour that
[18:02] are going to receive this maturity very
[18:05] quickly very suddenly as a release of an
[18:09] anointing for that and so by teaching on
[18:12] this we're making preparation we're
[18:14] trying to prepare God a landing pad a
[18:17] place where he can come and manifest his
[18:20] promises in US and through us as
[18:23] spiritual baby this restored part of our
[18:27] being our spirit must now be developed
[18:30] we're born again so we we got back what
[18:34] Adam lost in the garden but in baby form
[18:38] and so we want to keep eating the word
[18:41] we want to keep leaning into the things
[18:44] of the Spirit soaking in the presence of
[18:46] God worshipping the Lord fasting because
[18:50] missing meals and and and being careful
[18:53] about our words you know there's
[18:54] different forms of fasting we've always
[18:58] the first form of fasting we think about
[19:01] is denying our self food I believe this
[19:04] is very very important part of
[19:06] crucifying the old nature of growing up
[19:09] spiritually but there's other types of
[19:11] fasting that we can walk in as well
[19:14] periods of time where we say I'm going
[19:16] to watch my words like I've never
[19:18] watched them before I'm going to be very
[19:21] careful about negative words and
[19:23] critical words and I'm going to release
[19:25] life because we know that we hold life
[19:28] and death the power of life and death in
[19:31] our tongue and I'm going to be very
[19:33] careful there are times of fasting where
[19:35] we might say I'm going to turn off the
[19:38] television I'm not going to watch
[19:40] anything that is not spiritually
[19:43] edifying I'm going to be very careful
[19:45] about the music that I listen to and
[19:47] even the company I keep i'm going to set
[19:50] aside some time to draw near to the Lord
[19:53] all of these spiritual disciplines are
[19:55] very important ways of exercising the
[19:59] sensitivity of our spirits so that we
[20:02] can hear from the Lord sometimes we hear
[20:05] from everybody but the Lord because he's
[20:07] speaking in a still small voice
[20:09] everybody else is screaming at us so we
[20:12] have to learn to shut out these loud
[20:15] voices sometime entertainment all the
[20:19] different things addictions and things
[20:21] the enemy uses to get us caught up we've
[20:23] got to learn to shut that off and draw
[20:26] away with the Lord and I just encourage
[20:29] you i believe i'm speaking to somebody
[20:32] very specifically today God is calling
[20:37] you to a life of a season especially a
[20:41] season in your life of just drawing
[20:44] aside and hearing from the Lord and I
[20:48] believe you'll come out of it if you're
[20:49] faithful and if you're obedient I
[20:51] believe you'll come out of it much
[20:53] stronger than you entered into it in
[20:56] fact it just works that way it just
[20:58] absolutely happens that way then we gain
[21:01] a new consciousness when we're born
[21:03] again we start gaining a new
[21:05] consciousness of these two realms how
[21:07] they operate within our being
[21:10] unfortunately there's not been enough
[21:11] teaching in the body of Christ and the
[21:14] soul and the spirit has these words have
[21:17] been interchanged even in in the in the
[21:19] Bible you have to look sometime in the
[21:23] original language to see which is being
[21:26] spoken about it may say spirit but the
[21:28] the original word is speaking more of
[21:30] the soul life it may say so but the
[21:33] original word is speaking more the
[21:35] spirit life so it's been very
[21:36] interchangeable and it has kind of
[21:40] blurred the line to such an extent that
[21:42] we have become a little bit out of
[21:45] balance with a big soul the soul is well
[21:49] nourished well well challenged well
[21:51] satisfied and our spirit man is just
[21:54] shrinking away and we've got to see that
[21:57] stopped we've got to see that change
[21:59] we've got to call for transformation
[22:02] we've got to just speak life over our
[22:05] own spirit there is great research we
[22:09] don't have time to go into the depth of
[22:11] it I don't even know if I understand the
[22:13] fullness of the research but there's
[22:15] great research that has been done a
[22:17] concerning the effect of words a
[22:22] Japanese scientist for one has done a
[22:25] lot of research over the power of words
[22:28] on water the crystals that form in water
[22:34] and words negative words spoken over the
[22:37] water and then analyzing the water even
[22:40] writing negative words on papers and
[22:43] taping it to the glass where there's
[22:46] water and then examining the water and
[22:48] seeing that none
[22:49] is forming but by speaking words of
[22:52] affirmation in life they have analyzed
[22:56] the water and has seen these beautiful
[22:58] crystal formations forming almost
[23:00] changing the chemical balance of the
[23:04] water and and it was done by words and
[23:07] you say well that sounds a little bit
[23:09] out there well the Bible tells us that I
[23:12] quoted the scripture moment ago we hold
[23:15] the power of life and death in the
[23:17] tongue and I just pray that God will
[23:21] help me and I can help you by teaching
[23:24] and and that the Lord will help you by a
[23:26] spirit that we just become extra
[23:29] sensitive to the words of a life that we
[23:33] speak over one another especially when
[23:37] you're speaking directly to one another
[23:39] that you you just take some thought and
[23:42] speak some words of affirmation and life
[23:46] over someone because the spirit needs to
[23:50] be strengthened anyway when we start
[23:52] gaining a new consciousness of these two
[23:56] realms that operate within us the soul
[23:58] realm which is the earthly realm and the
[24:00] spirit realm which is the heavenly realm
[24:03] now I want to close with an interesting
[24:06] scripture in first Corinthians chapter
[24:08] 15 and verse 49 it says and as we have
[24:13] borne the image of the earthly we shall
[24:17] also bear the image of the heavenly see
[24:23] dual functionality we have been a clear
[24:28] reflection of the earthly realm now God
[24:32] is saying also I want you to be able to
[24:36] reflect the heavenly realm the character
[24:40] of Jesus his attributes and by walking
[24:46] in his authority that is the oneness
[24:49] that is the union that we are reaching
[24:54] for and looking for it's easy for us to
[24:57] relate to the earthly realm and to
[25:00] function in the earthly
[25:02] which is the place of our natural
[25:04] environment and life but that's not all
[25:06] of who you are your true identity is not
[25:10] defined by only the earthly realm you
[25:14] see you are spirit and so and so your
[25:18] life there's life inside of you when
[25:20] you're born again you are carrying a
[25:23] part of the eternal life of God in your
[25:27] human spirit just as Adam hey just as
[25:32] Adam was carrying in himself a part of
[25:38] the breath of God the breads the lives
[25:41] of God he God breathed into him and Adam
[25:45] was carrying a part of God the spirit
[25:51] part of Adam was of the same essence as
[25:56] the Living God you as a born-again
[25:58] believer are carrying in you a part of
[26:03] the very essence of God it's that
[26:07] resurrection life the Bible said if that
[26:10] same spirit that raised Jesus from the
[26:12] dead dwelling you it shall also quicken
[26:14] your mortal body if that same spirit
[26:18] because of the Holy Spirit living in you
[26:22] quickening your human spirit bringing
[26:26] you back to that place of wholeness no
[26:31] wonder there's so much dysfunction in
[26:33] the world no wonder there's so much
[26:35] dysfunction in families because we're
[26:37] only functioning in part of our true
[26:40] identity the earthly part the human part
[26:43] the fleshly part even the soulish part
[26:46] and God is saying I'm going to have a
[26:48] people I mean it's clear in the
[26:50] scripture I'm going to have a people who
[26:53] don't just live in the earthly in the
[26:55] carnal I'm going to have a people that
[26:58] function fully completely holy the very
[27:02] God of peace the scripture said the very
[27:05] God of peace sanctify you wholly wh 0 ll
[27:11] Y holy complete
[27:14] Lee sanctify you purify you set you
[27:18] apart as a complete being spirit soul
[27:24] and body are you beginning to get it or
[27:28] am i confusing you more I pray you're
[27:31] beginning to get it I feel the anointing
[27:33] I feel that the Spirit of God is is
[27:36] having us to go slow I believe he's
[27:39] having us to repeat things not because
[27:41] you are not capable of catching it no no
[27:45] but because this is how the Spirit
[27:48] teaches us line upon line precept upon
[27:52] precept and remember that there are
[27:54] people watching these programs of all
[27:57] kinds of different levels of
[27:58] spirituality and scriptural
[28:01] understanding and I've asked the Lord I
[28:04] mean I don't have to be somebody I don't
[28:07] have to be some dynamic television
[28:09] preacher I think you can look at me and
[28:11] say I'm not after that but I have asked
[28:14] the Lord Lord I'm willing if it has to
[28:16] sound so simple you know if it's
[28:20] unpolished if I do stud around spin
[28:22] around a little bit it doesn't matter to
[28:24] me what matters to me is that you let me
[28:26] speak to whoever you've placed out there
[28:30] for me to speak into their life and let
[28:33] them get something from what I'm saying
[28:35] based on their level of understanding
[28:37] and let us never be satisfied with where
[28:40] we are spiritually let us all be
[28:42] reaching for more calling for more well
[28:45] my time is gone and I have to pray
[28:47] father right now in the name of Jesus we
[28:49] release the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[28:52] to prepare a bride that will function in
[28:56] complete wholeness spirit soul and body
[29:00] in the wonderful name of Yeshua we pray
[29:02] thank you for watching the Eagles cry
[29:04] tune in again bye-bye for today
