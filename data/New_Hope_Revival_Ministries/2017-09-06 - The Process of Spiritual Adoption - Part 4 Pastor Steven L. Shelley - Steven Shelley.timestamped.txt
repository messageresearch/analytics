[0:00] [Music]
[0:20] you
[0:21] [Music]
[0:37] you
[0:38] [Music]
[0:50] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen
[0:53] Shelley and you're watching the Eagles
[0:55] cry I want to welcome you to the program
[0:58] today and I hope you've been following
[1:01] this series thus far this will be
[1:04] program number four and we are studying
[1:07] together the process of spiritual
[1:10] adoption and we're finding out in the
[1:13] scripture that God is calling his people
[1:16] in this hour to that place of
[1:18] relationship to that place of adoption
[1:21] and we're just barely scratching the
[1:24] surface thus far but we're going to
[1:26] share at least we have gotten out of our
[1:29] first scripture reference it took us
[1:31] three programs to get out of Romans 8
[1:33] and so now we're going to move into
[1:36] Ephesians in just a moment but I pray
[1:38] that the Lord will speak to you from his
[1:40] word why don't you take some time to
[1:43] contact our ministry the information for
[1:46] contact us is available there on your
[1:48] screen we would love to hear from you we
[1:51] would love to know that you're watching
[1:52] the program and that it's been a
[1:54] blessing to you we would be more than
[1:56] happy to join in prayer with you over
[1:58] your prayer requests if you would so
[2:01] desire to send them in and we're also
[2:04] available to celebrate with you when God
[2:07] answers prayer and it's always an
[2:09] exciting thing to have a need and
[2:12] present it to the Lord and lay your
[2:14] petition before him and then stand back
[2:16] and watch God move and I think we said
[2:19] on the last program God doesn't always
[2:21] move when we want him to move or in the
[2:23] way that we want him to move but because
[2:25] he's sovereign he works all things out
[2:28] for our good that was part of our
[2:31] scripture reading last time we were
[2:33] together that all things work together
[2:34] for the good of those who are the called
[2:37] of the Lord those who are called
[2:39] according to his purpose so we're going
[2:42] to get right into the study today and I
[2:45] pray that you will just catch up with us
[2:47] if you happen to miss a program and
[2:50] let's just get in and see what the Lord
[2:51] will show us from his word today a man
[2:54] we're going to read this week from
[2:57] Ephesians chapter one and it also has
[3:02] of the truths that I love so dearly from
[3:05] Romans 8 and we are talking about
[3:08] adoption and I'm starting off the series
[3:11] by reading to you all of the places in
[3:14] the New Testament where the word
[3:16] adoption is mentioned and we said at the
[3:20] end of the program last week that the
[3:23] word adoption is actually made up of two
[3:26] Greek words one of those words is pulse
[3:30] which means a mature son and the other
[3:35] is a Greek word that is thesis and it
[3:39] means placement and so when we read the
[3:42] word adoption in the Bible we know that
[3:45] that word really means the placing of a
[3:49] mature son and God is calling his
[3:53] children to maturity in this hour and
[3:56] you know i'm thinking of scriptures that
[3:59] talk about being children tossed to and
[4:02] fro and children who are sitting in the
[4:05] marketplace is saying i piped unto you
[4:08] and you didn't dance or other scriptures
[4:11] that talk about the people sitting down
[4:13] to eat and instead of eating they rose
[4:15] up to play and we've all made foolish
[4:18] mistakes like that in our Christian walk
[4:20] and but but God is calling us in this
[4:24] hour to come to a place of maturity and
[4:27] maturity is Authority and when we start
[4:31] walking in maturity and in the wisdom of
[4:36] the Lord that comes in maturity or with
[4:40] maturity then we can start focusing very
[4:44] carefully and specifically on the
[4:47] destiny that God has planned for our
[4:49] lives and we can quit talking about it
[4:51] and do it aren't you ready to just start
[4:54] doing what God has called you to do so
[4:57] we're going to start reading in
[4:58] Ephesians chapter 1 and we're going to
[5:02] begin with verse 3 blessed be the God
[5:06] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[5:09] had blessed us with all spiritual
[5:12] blessings in heavenly places
[5:15] in Christ and we can testify that as
[5:19] children of God followers of Yeshua the
[5:22] Messiah that we have been truly blessed
[5:25] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[5:28] places in mushy OCH verse 4 according as
[5:33] he hath chosen us in him before the
[5:37] foundation of the world do you recognize
[5:41] that as a part of the Bride of Christ as
[5:44] a part of that overcoming company of
[5:48] believers that you were chosen in Christ
[5:53] before the foundation of the world the
[5:58] Bible talks about in the book of the
[6:00] revelation these are they whose names
[6:03] were found written in the Lamb's Book of
[6:06] Life before the foundation of the world
[6:09] how could that be possible well we read
[6:13] that in Romans chapter 8 how that by
[6:16] God's foreknowledge you say to me pastor
[6:21] did I have a choice was it my choice was
[6:24] it an act of my free will to accept the
[6:27] Lord Jesus Christ as my savior of course
[6:30] it was an act of your will but because
[6:34] God is omniscient he knew he has all
[6:38] knowledge he knew your choice before you
[6:41] were ever born that's the God that we
[6:44] serve one of the reasons why I like to
[6:47] speak on that so often it's because it
[6:49] gives me some peace it causes me to be
[6:54] able to relax and trust and know that if
[6:58] God knew my choice would be to serve him
[7:02] before I was ever born in fact before
[7:05] the world was ever framed and the
[7:07] foundations of the earth were ever laid
[7:10] then no matter what happens to me in my
[7:12] life today I can relax and say God
[7:15] you've got it under control if you knew
[7:18] everything that was going to happen in
[7:20] my life before the world was framed then
[7:23] I have nothing to worry about if I can
[7:25] learn to
[7:26] lean heavily on you and trust you then
[7:30] everything's going to be all right
[7:31] you're going to take care of me and so
[7:34] we understand that when we eventually
[7:37] are born and we come into our life and
[7:40] we make that choice to follow the Lord
[7:43] Jesus Christ we used to sing a song that
[7:46] said my name was written down there's a
[7:49] new name written down in glory because I
[7:52] got saved and we understand from the
[7:55] scripture that's not the way it was at
[7:57] all these are they whose names were
[7:59] found written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[8:01] before the foundation of the world how
[8:03] could God do that again he did it
[8:06] because he had foreknowledge of our
[8:09] decision before we were ever born and
[8:13] now this scripture tells us that he has
[8:16] chosen us in him before the foundation
[8:21] of the world that we should be holy holy
[8:29] sanctified set apart in in really
[8:34] researching the word holy and holiness
[8:37] and studying it all the way through the
[8:39] scriptures lately a very simple
[8:42] definition of holy is above ordinary
[8:46] something that God has set apart for His
[8:50] divine purposes above average above
[8:55] ordinary somebody said well that that
[8:56] just doesn't seem to make it big enough
[8:59] well what I want to do by using that
[9:02] definition is to help you see that God
[9:05] has chosen you to live a life that is
[9:08] above average we're not survivors you
[9:12] know in America there's a popular
[9:14] so-called reality television program
[9:17] called survivor and it's about people
[9:20] who get put on an island and and they
[9:23] try to see who can stay there the
[9:24] longest without voting each other off
[9:26] and they go through different tests and
[9:29] obstacles and so forth to see who
[9:31] ultimately will be the number one
[9:32] survivor well I want to tell you
[9:35] something that's how people who have no
[9:37] hope live they hope to be the
[9:39] one who can survive but we are not
[9:43] called as the Bride of Christ to be
[9:45] survivors we have been called as a part
[9:49] of the Bride of Christ to be overcomers
[9:51] to overcome to to live a life in which
[9:57] we would not be overcome by evil by the
[10:02] wicked influences of this life and of
[10:05] the world and of society and of sin but
[10:08] that we would overcome evil with good so
[10:12] let me tell you something brother sister
[10:15] you're not called just to be a survivor
[10:17] jesus said in John 10 I've come that you
[10:20] might have life that's good and that you
[10:23] might have it more abundantly that's the
[10:26] difference between a survivor is one who
[10:28] has life but a overcomer is one who has
[10:33] life more abundantly the abundant life
[10:37] of the Lord Jesus Christ and that's what
[10:39] we have been called for is to overcome
[10:43] so we're just thankful I'm just so
[10:46] thankful for what God has done and when
[10:50] he says I've called you and
[10:51] predestinated you to be holy to be set
[10:54] apart not to function in the same way
[10:58] that others function who have no Savior
[11:00] who have no hope who have no salvation
[11:02] through Jesus Christ they just barely
[11:05] get by and it you've heard the
[11:08] expression may be dog-eat-dog meaning
[11:12] i'll walk over whoever i have to walk
[11:14] over to get to the top but that's not
[11:17] how the holy of the Lord the redeemed of
[11:19] the Lord the sanctified of the Lord
[11:21] that's not how we live our lives we live
[11:24] our lives set apart above ordinary above
[11:27] average sanctified pure asking God daily
[11:32] that our flesh would be crucified that
[11:35] our motives would be examined you know
[11:38] we're seeing after all these years of
[11:40] serving the Lord that it's all about our
[11:43] motive god is looking deeper than our
[11:46] behavior and our actions he sees that he
[11:50] certainly does know what we do and how
[11:52] we live
[11:53] how we behave but man sees the outward
[11:55] appearance man sees the behavior pattern
[11:58] man sees the the overflow of who we are
[12:01] on the inside but God sees first who we
[12:05] are on the inside man has no right to
[12:09] judge another man's motives but God who
[12:14] sees the heart automatically knows your
[12:18] motive the intent of your heart what you
[12:21] really mean when you say something what
[12:24] you really mean when you do something
[12:27] and so we are a daily coming to the Lord
[12:31] we must and say father helped me with my
[12:34] motive let there be no selfish ambition
[12:38] in me let my my whole reason for living
[12:43] be to glorify your name to help instruct
[12:47] others and to equip others and to
[12:50] testify to others of what you have done
[12:55] in my own life and there's no period on
[12:59] the end of that sentence what you have
[13:00] done it's really what you're still doing
[13:03] god is still working on us we're even
[13:07] after years some of us have served the
[13:09] Lord I have spent more years of my life
[13:14] serving the Lord than not serving the
[13:16] Lord and yet i'm still a work in
[13:18] progress i'm not a finished product God
[13:21] is still dealing with me and amazingly a
[13:26] little bit backwards for me is the way
[13:29] it happened because I grew up in a in a
[13:32] church environment where we there was
[13:34] much emphasis on on behavior and and how
[13:38] you were observed by others and what you
[13:40] did and where you went and so forth and
[13:42] I think these things are very very
[13:44] important but you can line all of that
[13:47] up and still have a heart jesus said you
[13:50] can have the you can be like a whited
[13:54] Sepulcher you can be a beautiful tomb on
[13:57] the outside but inside you can be full
[14:00] of dead men's bones and so that's kind
[14:04] of why I think my
[14:06] I experienced was a little bit backward
[14:07] because I was able to get the outside
[14:10] and at least the appearance and and my
[14:13] demeanor behavior lined up but there
[14:16] were still things in my heart that God
[14:19] had to deal with and he's still dealing
[14:20] with them my motive and and these these
[14:24] deep things you know that we carry
[14:27] because of maybe what we've been through
[14:30] or because of relationships or rejection
[14:33] or whatever and so I celebrate the fact
[14:36] today that I am not what I am going to
[14:40] be but I'm surely not what I used to be
[14:43] and why is that it's because of the
[14:45] grace of the lord jesus christ and i
[14:47] asked him for the same grace in your
[14:49] life and if you're willing to accept the
[14:52] price that he paid for you on calvary
[14:55] you can start your journey with him
[14:57] right now and because the days are short
[15:00] because we're living in the end time
[15:02] there will be a measure of acceleration
[15:04] where many people are going to begin to
[15:06] walk in mature truths of the of the word
[15:09] that they have not had the life
[15:11] experience to get to but they've
[15:13] received it supernaturally and that's
[15:16] part of the importance of satellite
[15:18] television because God is bringing
[15:20] truths right into your home that you
[15:23] might not ever for instance this program
[15:26] i'm not saying only this program i'm
[15:28] just saying one of many but you may
[15:30] never come to see me in alabama and I
[15:33] may never be able to come to see you
[15:35] where you are but perhaps there's a
[15:37] little something that we're carrying
[15:39] that God has deposited in our lives that
[15:43] he wants you to be a partaker of and so
[15:46] look look what's happening I'm sitting
[15:48] here and behind a little desk in the
[15:50] sanctuary of my church in Alabama and
[15:53] you're watching me on the other side of
[15:55] the world so that's the grace of God and
[15:59] I love that about the Lord and he knows
[16:01] when we pray over these programs we say
[16:04] Lord we don't know who's going to be
[16:06] watching but you do so you speak what
[16:09] you would have spoken so verse 5 again
[16:13] says having predestinated us unto the
[16:16] adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[16:19] himself according to the good pleasure
[16:21] of his will to the praise of the glory
[16:25] of His grace wherein he hath made us
[16:28] accepted in the beloved now that's good
[16:33] good news and it's a good word in whom
[16:36] we have redemption through his blood now
[16:40] what the blood of lambs and goats and
[16:42] bulls could not do God sending his own
[16:46] son in the form of sinful flesh in the
[16:50] form of flesh in the form of man
[16:52] although he was free from sin and
[16:54] without sin he came in a body of flesh
[16:57] and he paid the price he shed his blood
[17:01] he became our substitute our
[17:04] propitiation he became our sacrifice our
[17:07] Paschal Lamb our Passover lamb Messiah
[17:11] Yeshua that's what he became on my
[17:14] behalf he paid for my sins now talk
[17:18] about love the Bible said no greater
[17:21] love hath any man than this that he
[17:24] would lay down his life as a sacrifice
[17:26] for sin Jesus helped us to understand
[17:30] you're not taking my life I'm giving my
[17:32] life it wasn't the Roman soldiers that
[17:36] took his life he gave his life as a
[17:39] sacrifice so that you and I might be
[17:41] redeemed to God I praise the Lord for
[17:44] that in whom we have redemption through
[17:46] his blood the forgiveness of sins
[17:50] according to the riches of His grace you
[17:54] would never be able to withdraw all the
[17:58] riches of the grace of god he is so rich
[18:02] in mercy and so full of grace for those
[18:06] who will ask for those who need him and
[18:10] I'm needy and I'm I'm willing and ready
[18:13] to admit that I'm needy i need the
[18:15] Lord's grace I need his mercy I need his
[18:19] help not on a weekly basis either on a
[18:22] daily basis and sometimes every hour on
[18:25] the hour I need him and he tells me that
[18:29] I can come to him when I need him he
[18:31] said cast all of your case
[18:33] all of your cares on me because I care
[18:36] for you because I want to help you carry
[18:38] your burdens and he has he's been
[18:41] faithful to do that now look at verse 8
[18:45] wherein he hath abounded toward us in
[18:48] all wisdom and prudence now that word
[18:51] prudence in the original is
[18:53] understanding God wants to give us
[18:55] wisdom and understanding he wants to
[18:59] release to us impart to us wisdom and
[19:03] understanding verse 9 having made known
[19:07] unto us the mystery of his will
[19:11] according to his good pleasure which he
[19:15] had purposed in himself that in the
[19:19] dispensation of the fullness of times
[19:22] now I believe that's the dispensation
[19:25] that we're living in we've talked about
[19:27] this on other series that in the
[19:32] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[19:34] might gather together in one all things
[19:37] in Christ both which are in heaven and
[19:41] which are on earth even in him a joining
[19:46] together a synergy that's taking place
[19:49] between all the things that are in
[19:51] heaven and all the saints that are on
[19:54] the earth a divine union in Christ
[19:58] that's part of the adoption process that
[20:03] God is revealing to us by the spirit
[20:06] verse 11 in whom also we have obtained
[20:09] an inheritance being predestinated
[20:13] according to the purpose of him who
[20:16] worketh all things after the counsel of
[20:18] his own will you know what that's saying
[20:20] again relax take a deep breath God is
[20:25] going to work out his perfect will in
[20:28] your life if you quit resisting and
[20:32] surrender he's going to have his way
[20:34] he's waiting on us remember what what
[20:39] Yeshua said to show to Saul on the road
[20:42] to Damascus it's hard for you
[20:46] to kick against the pricks why don't you
[20:50] surrender is what he was saying instead
[20:52] of resisting me receive me and you know
[20:55] we have a lot of extra problems in our
[20:58] life because we resist the will of God
[21:00] if you and I could come to the place
[21:03] today where we quit resisting the will
[21:06] of God because it's not what we want or
[21:09] what we think we're good at or what we
[21:12] think we qualify for or what we're
[21:14] worthy of are capable of I mean listen I
[21:18] have had to come to a place where I have
[21:20] said to the Lord I I'm not much good you
[21:23] know really at all I'm not extremely
[21:25] good at anything I would almost call
[21:29] myself a jack of all trades but that's
[21:31] very very poor too because I can't fix
[21:35] anything and that's usually what you
[21:37] think about when you say that but what I
[21:39] mean is the rest of that phrase says a
[21:41] jack of all trades and a master of none
[21:43] and that that's the part that I am a
[21:46] master of none I can do you know a few
[21:49] things several things pretty good but
[21:52] with the grace of God and by the help of
[21:55] the Lord he takes what I have what he's
[21:58] given me is what abilities given me and
[22:01] he can use that in a mighty way as long
[22:05] as I don't resist his will and I start
[22:08] saying but I can't do it I don't tell
[22:10] the Lord that anymore I don't tell the
[22:13] Lord I can't what I say to the Lord is
[22:15] if you've called me if you're the one
[22:17] that's called me this is on you you've
[22:20] got to help me and I don't say that with
[22:23] disrespect I say that because he's my
[22:25] abba father I have that kind of a
[22:27] relationship with him that I can say
[22:29] Lord I will I will you want me to go
[22:32] I'll go but I cannot go like Moses said
[22:36] I cannot go without your presence I
[22:38] cannot go without your glory I cannot go
[22:41] without your help there was a time in my
[22:44] life that I would have said I cannot go
[22:46] I can't do that I'm not capable I'm not
[22:48] worthy i'm not smart enough I'm not good
[22:50] enough but now I say I can't go unless
[22:54] you go with me and that's where God
[22:57] wants to bring
[22:58] all of us in this hour to a place of
[23:01] true obedience to his will and
[23:04] submission and surrender to the divine
[23:07] purposes of God in your life and once
[23:10] you allow him to have his way and let
[23:13] him help you to accomplish through you
[23:15] what he has called you for then all you
[23:17] have to do is rest rest rest in him rest
[23:22] in his were dressed in his promise
[23:26] anyway i could go on in that i'm
[23:29] thinking of a lot of other things but i
[23:31] think i probably should try at least to
[23:33] stay with this but it's just good to be
[23:36] at rest it's good to have peace jesus
[23:40] said I've come to give you peace not not
[23:42] the kind of peace the world gives you
[23:43] either because that's not enough the
[23:45] kind of peace that I have it passes all
[23:48] human understanding and endures forever
[23:50] that is the piece that is the Shalom of
[23:54] Yeshua the Lord Jesus Christ no doubt
[23:56] about it in whom also we have obtained
[24:00] an inheritance verse 11 being
[24:02] predestinated according to the purpose
[24:04] of him who work at all things after the
[24:07] counsel of his own will not my will Lord
[24:09] your will be done that we should be to
[24:13] the praise and the glory to the praise
[24:17] of his glory who first trusted in Christ
[24:21] in whom ye also trusted after that ye
[24:25] heard the word of truth the gospel of
[24:28] your salvation in whom also after that
[24:30] you believed you were sealed with that
[24:33] Holy Spirit of promise which is the
[24:37] earnest of our inheritance until the
[24:40] redemption of the purchased possession
[24:43] unto the praise of his glory there's
[24:46] that earnest we talked about enrollments
[24:50] ate the first fruits of his spirit and
[24:53] now we're talking about the earnest of
[24:55] his spirit saying to us that the
[24:58] born-again experience including the
[25:00] baptism of the Holy Spirit is only the
[25:04] token it is of course the greatest work
[25:09] of mercy and grace that the world has
[25:11] ever known
[25:12] but so many of us have came well in fact
[25:16] many of us came to be justified and we
[25:19] said I've arrived whole denominations of
[25:22] the world only teach justification to be
[25:27] saved to join the church to have
[25:30] forgiveness of sins and that was the
[25:32] beginning Martin Luther did a lot of
[25:34] teaching on justification the just shall
[25:36] live by faith and then God raised up the
[25:38] Wesley brothers and there was a lot of
[25:40] teaching on the next step of our the
[25:43] next installment of the new birth and
[25:45] that is to be sanctified to be set apart
[25:48] to let the Spirit of God the Word of God
[25:50] Wash U and cleanse you inside and to
[25:53] correct your behavior and your attitudes
[25:55] and and to deliver you from jealousies
[25:58] and resentments and insecurities and so
[26:00] forth and then in the in the dawning of
[26:04] the new Pentecostal day in late 1800s
[26:07] and early 1900s we began to see the
[26:10] restoration of the gifts and the pouring
[26:12] out of the Holy Spirit something that
[26:16] hadn't hadn't been well known in
[26:18] hundreds and hundreds of years and and
[26:21] it's amazing that there are major groups
[26:24] of people that have gone to one step and
[26:26] stopped and said there's no more and
[26:28] others said wait a minute there's more
[26:30] to than just being justified I'm going
[26:32] to be sanctified by the washing of the
[26:34] water the word and then many stopped
[26:35] there but some said no no no I'm going
[26:38] up to Pentecost I'm going to receive the
[26:41] restoration of the gifts in the baptism
[26:43] of the Holy Spirit unfortunately many
[26:45] stopped there and that is only the
[26:49] earnest the firstfruits of the Spirit
[26:51] the beginning of what God wants to do in
[26:54] our lives so what we've been teaching on
[26:58] this process of spiritual adoption is
[27:01] the rest of what God wants to do he
[27:05] wants to bring us to a place of full
[27:08] adoption where he fully occupies our
[27:12] life and I'm gonna contend I'm gonna
[27:15] push I'm gonna pray I'm going to press
[27:18] and I'm going to believe God to see that
[27:19] manifested in my own life and I have a
[27:21] burden for you that you would see it
[27:23] manifested in your life
[27:25] well don't ever stop and sab got all of
[27:27] god I need there's so much more so much
[27:30] more I can't believe my time is gone I
[27:33] feel like I just started but I'm going
[27:36] to pray that God will speak to your
[27:38] heart that he'll make his word real to
[27:39] you right now father would you speak to
[27:42] men and women's hearts would you quicken
[27:44] your word and make it live and alive in
[27:46] them and father let these truths pull to
[27:50] them and call to them the deep calling
[27:52] to the deep and give each one a desire
[27:54] to search these things through the
[27:56] scripture and see if they'd be so
[27:58] release your healing virtue in the name
[28:00] of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua we pray
[28:02] amen and amen thank you for watching the
[28:07] eagles cried don't forget to tune in
[28:09] again next week for the next part I
[28:11] guess it'll be part 5 I'm already
