Description:
Jesus came to find the ungodly and redeem the fallen of Adam’s race, to reinstate us to His original thoughts about us when we were perfect, holy and righteous.  My destiny God designed according to His foreknowledge to be in the image of His Son, and He overcame in all things.  When the accuser accused Jesus, He answered him not a word.  He is the Great Overcomer; He is our example.
