to the broadcast today I'm from New Hope revival ministries in Smith Station Alabama and I'm also coming to you today in cooperation with brother Eric Erickson in the gospel channel and we want to welcome you to the program and we've been having a wonderful time together in the word for several months now and we're just delighted with all of your comments your prayer requests that you send in and the praise reports it's so so wonderful to hear when God answers prayer and we appreciate you taking the time to let us know it if you haven't turned in any prayer requests we'd be happy to join together in faith with you and believe God to meet your needs the last time we were together we had a guest and he's back with us again today and I'm so very happy to have brother Gerald Hicks in our last time together he shared his wonderful testimony I'm telling you it I just felt emotional from the beginning to the end and I had heard bits and pieces of it personally but to hear him share it again was such a blessing to me to be reminded of the faithfulness of God and to be reminded how that God works through all of our circumstances he is working a beautiful work in our lives to bring us into the fullness of our destiny his calling upon our lives and I know that many of you were encouraged by the testimony and we just want to say to brother Hicks welcome again we're very glad to have you on the program today pastor Shelly I'm so honored to be here today I'm very excited about what God is doing in this present hour you know we talked about your life and your family and your beginnings but we didn't take an opportunity in the last program to mention your wife and children will you tell us a little bit about your Emily yes I am very honored to have a lovely wife of 25 years 25 years and the Lord has blessed us with two beautiful children we have a nineteen or excuse me we have a 22 year old daughter her name is Katie Katie and we have a 20 year old son and his name is Cal of course my wife's name is Annette and she is the love of my life and of the Lord has blessed us and been so kind to us all through the years I don't think I've ever asked you how you omit how did you meet your wife well we met at church of course what better place to find a wife that's right and we we met at church I was preaching revival in the church where she was attending and I just knew from the moment that I saw her that she was the one the Lord had for me and did she have a similar feeling well I'm not sure if she's got that similar feeling at that moment but I was certainly able to convince all very good that that's a fair answer to a personal question really wasn't it you know you were ministering in our church last night and it was so powerful we had just gotten back from a trip about 30 minutes before the service so I was physically worn out but by the time the service was over I was so lifted up and so encouraged and so reminded I like how how God confirms you know we hear the word layer upon layer and and then God sends a word of confirmation and I love the time before when you were here some of the things you brought were things that we had just been speaking in the church and you know that's a pastors delight and an evangelist comes along and strengthens and then you took us to another level and and I appreciated it so much you told us about an experience that you had had in prayer where the weighty glory of the Lord had come upon you and I'd like for you to share that and then you also shared with us three points that were given to you related to that experience and I mean I know that really that that sermon could have it could have been a series I mean you could have carried that for weeks and weeks stayed right on own subject just expanded it and expanded it because it was so full of truth would you share that experience with us I mean I know it's supernatural but we have some people out there who'd and who believe in the supernatural so just take your liberty and and share that if you will and then we want to know the three points and how that relates to where we are in 2018 absolutely it was just it was just before Thanksgiving last year I was in a tent revival in Florida and one morning I had been talking to the Lord I had just been feeling after the Lord you might say and I had stepped up under the tent and I had just decided that I was going to spend some time in the presence of the Lord and as I began to walk back and forth across the tent just just talking to the Lord and feeling after him it was early in the morning it was very still outside the curtains were down no one knew that I was under the tent and after being there just a few moments there was a wind that literally blew up underneath the tent and as that wind blew up under the tent immediately there was a very weighty presence of God that came into the tent and it just settled down upon me in such a way that the presence of the Lord just started pressing me toward the ground and as I was I was there in that weighty presence of God the Lord spoke in my ear and the voice of the Lord said the heavens are now open my mind above this tent Wow the heavens are now open above this tent and so I certainly received that from the Lord and as affirmation of receiving that I immediately began to release with my mouth words of faith in me and words of deliverance into the atmosphere I just began to use the words mouth to speak faith and speak deliverance into the atmosphere not just concerning that tent revival but concerning the lives of everyone around and not just for that time but for a future time as well right and so as I began to to just just think about that experience I began to see the miraculous start to unfold almost immediately in just a few few moments the presence of the God of the Lord again was so real that night in the service we witnessed a miraculous healing grace all throughout that meeting from that service to the very end of the meeting every night there was something miraculous that would take place and even from that time to present I have witnessed numerous miracles and I certainly feel like that it is a result of the heavens being opened of Krays God there have been times when we served that I worshiped and we labored under a closed heaven right and yes we do see God move even when the heaven is closed but how much greater we see God move when the heavens are open absolutely praise God and so it is that the Lord just just began to make that even more and more real to me and so when the meeting closed and I made my way back home to Arkansas I went into my prayer room and as I was there in my prayer room seeking the Lord and again just spending time with God it was there in another season of prayer that the voice of the Lord would speak to me again and this time he said to me that as the old year was coming to a close and the new year was now upon us that the church was turning the corner into the third day well and as he spoke that to me he said that it was going to be a time of restoration a time of recovery and a time of preparation and so for quite some time I just stayed in the presence of God and I tried to Zorba's actly what God was saying not just for that moment but also for the days and the weeks and the months that lie ahead should God Terry and I certainly believe that as we closed out 2017 and we entered into 2018 I have certainly been able to witness restoration recovery and preparation on many levels for many different people in the kingdom of God that's very interesting will you take us to your text can we just read a little portion of that scripture that you read to us from was it second Samuel absolutely all right let's look at that just a moment because I think the I think the way you took those three phrases and related them to the verse of scripture was very very powerful and I believe the people would appreciate hearing that absolutely it's a beautiful passage it's in 1st Samuel or Samuel chapter number 30 a beautiful Old Testament story and the scripture said verse number 1 and it came to pass when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day mmm that the Amalekites had invaded the south and zig leg and smitten zig leg and burned it with fire now I have read this particular passage on a number of different times through the years I've read it in a casual way just reading the word of the Lord right I've also pulled from this other other messages and used this particular story in times past but never have I noticed until this experience that the scripture said that he came to zig lag on the third day now we understand that the third day would represent resurrection right we would understand that that's new life we would understand that up you know that's just simply saying that there is going to be a resurrection there is going to be a coming forth yes yes you might say and so I certainly believe that we are in an hour when the church is truly coming forth Alleluia god I believe that we certainly are arriving at a moment when we are going to experience a resurrection in the spirit realm that we've never experienced before Ray's gone I believe there are some gifts I believe there are some callings I believe there are some experiences that are going to be resurrected in the hearts and lives and the spirits of individuals I believe they're Upendra that are listening to us right now man who have gifts and callings that are lying dormant in their life and now that the heaven is opened these things are going to literally be resurrected in them and I believe that God has strategic voices such as yours that's going to literally call these gifts forth I mean that's gonna literally call these experiences forth in our hearts and lives hallelujah that is so powerful so powerful Reed own brother and so the scripture said and had taken the women captive that were therein and slew not any either great or small but carried them away and went on their way so David and his men came to the city verse 3 and behold it was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captive notice verse 4 then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep how many people listening to our voice today yes have been in that same situation I wonder who it is mm-hmm that might possibly be there right now right that they've wept until there's no more strength to weep right how many people are there right now that they've shed tears until until there are no more tears to be shed they've prayed until they feel like there's no more prayers to be prayed there's no more words to be said how many times as servants of God we exhaust ourselves in the spirit yes trying to feel after God pouring ourself out to the Lord until we feel like there's no than laugh he-man and David was there David's men were there they were grieved and the reason they were grieved was not because they believed or they were weeping not because they believed that God was going to miraculously give them back or return to them or adventure weeping because they believed that their wives and children were missing and presumed dead they were weeping because everything they loved everything that was important to them was now destroyed by the city they called their own was now the smoldering ruins of what used to be how many people look at their life and that's exactly the way they feel yes sir that it's the smoldering ruins of what used to be and what do they do they lift up their voice and weep right they weep in disappointment they weep because of despair they weep because the pain seems to be unbearable however God does not want us to weep because of pain and despair and because the situation is devastating but understand God wants to bring about restoration he wants to bring about true recovery in our hearts and in our lives somehow David understood that as dark as this situation may be right now the God that I serve is thing and the same God that delivered me out of the mouth of the lion yes and the same God that delivered me out of the pall of the bear the same God that delivered the uncircumcised Philistine giant they called a champion huh into my hand is the same God it's gonna make away is this very unfortunate situation amen amen so David had hope absolutely absolutely and the thing is David truly wanted the men around him to have as much hope as he however at this particular time they were so overcome by the present plight of Ziklag and the absence of their wives and children and the fact that everything they loved was now destroyed their anger became displaced and after they grieved they became angry and they pointed their finger at their leader the one they should have loved the most because David loved them more than anyone else loved them oh yes he invested in them when no one else wanted to invest I am right he wrapped his arms around them he embraced them he invited them into his inner circle when everyone else wanted to discard them except and throw them away and now rather than rallying around David rather than holding his hands up and saying as difficult and as horrible as this is we're gonna get through it together they wanted to stone him Wow they wanted to stone him but the Bible lets us know that David did something that was amazing the scripture tells us as David was greatly distressed verse number 6 for the people spake of stoning him because all the soul of the people was grieved right every man for his sons and for his daughters but David notice he encouraged himself in the Lord his God no preacher encouraged him no preacher to encourage him no friend to pat him on the back no comrade to call him and tell him everything's gonna be all right David had to reach deep within Alleluia and he had to pull from the resources of his own soul and rezoned and encouraged himself in the Lord somebody said how could David do that just exactly what did he do and perhaps maybe it is they've come you need to encourage yourself in the law and one of the ways that we can do that another writer in the New Testament would say I think myself happy hmm hallelujah I believe myself happy see at the end of the day it's right our life is always going to travel in the direction of our thoughts Alleva praise God that's why it's very important as Christians as children of God as servants of God that we always keep our thought life as positive and as hopeful as possible so true David look beyond what his physical eyes saw at that very moment and he began to think about a God who had been faithful to him over and over time and again he began to think about a God who had always come through a gob that had always been there for him no matter how difficult it might have been and as he started thinking about that encouragement started coming to him perhaps it is that David thought about how God delivered him out of the mouth of a hungry lion perhaps it is that he remembered how he felt when God delivered him out of the pall of an angry bear or maybe it is that David remembered how he felt when he stopped at the bottom of that Valley by that brook he picked up five smooth stones somebody asked me one time said why did he pick up five smooth stones I heard one preacher say that those five stones represented the letters in the name of Jesus and that sounds wonderful Jes us and Jay is just he is expect as something you is unusually and it's a supernatural every time we mentioned the name Jesus alone we just expect something unusually supernatural to happen that's every time we call on the name Jesus man we just expect something unusually supernatural to happen praise another preacher said well those five stones represent f AI th faith that sounds wonderful and still yet another man said they represent grac and that's wonderful does it get any better than the name Jesus doesn't get any better than faith in God doesn't get any better than living under the grace or the unmerited favor of an Almighty God doesn't get any better than that but I still heard another man say that David picked up five smooth stones because he heard somewhere along the way that Goliath had four other brothers and he wanted to be prepared for them all so am i and all of that sounds great and somebody asked me preacher what do you think it meant well I just simply think that David picked up five smooth stones because that's all his pelts could hold okay all right and so he picked up five stones he crossed that brook when he started up that hillside how he must have felt as Goliath began to Harold come one insult after another finally Goliath is so angry he said I cannot believe that saw the man he is that he would send a mere boy out to do a man's job and Goliath said today I'm gonna pull your head off of your shoulders I'm gonna feed your scrawny carcass to the fowl of the air and you would think that David would be intimidated understand that David was not like his brothers he was not a man of war he was a he was a shepherd he was abiding in the field with his father sheep when word came to him right - just take provision and inquire concerning the battle however when he arrived at the battlefield all of the dreams that he had in his mind all of the thoughts that he had of the grandeur and the splendor of an of a battle was dashed because instead of seeing brave valiant men standing with glistening armor and holding shinies shields and swords in their hands he found a bun of grumbling men nests huddled around campfires and all they could talk about was a Philistine giant my my they were fearful and they were afraid and David went from one campfire to another trying to figure out just exactly what is going on what has gone wrong you are the bravest you are the strongest you are the best that our beloved Israel has what in the world is wrong have you men not forgotten is there not a cause oh my what might happen in the kingdom of God if somebody could rise up in this last hour in which we live and understand is there not yes yes yes and so it is David began to reflect on that and as he starts up that hillside Goliath says I'm gonna pull your head off your shoulders I'm gonna feed your scrawny carcass to the fowl of the air and David without any fear said you come to me with a sword with a spear and a shield but he said I come to you in the name of the Lord hallelujah the writer said the name of the Lord is a strong and the righteous run into it and they are safe David must have been thinking about this as he was sitting in the smoldering ruins of sick leg he must have remembered how it worked yes when he put that one stone in that Shepherd sling as it began to as it began the circle high above his head he released the stone but it was the hand of an Almighty God the same God that created heaven earth and all of the fullness thereof guided that stone into the forehead of Goliath of David felt the earth tremble beneath his feet as Goliath fell to the ground of how he must have what he must have been thinking of when he went over took goliaths own sword cut his head off and now sitting in the smoldering ruins of his beloved sick leg he remembers hearing the voice he remembers hearing the sound of the ladies singing saw has killed his thousands of but David his ten thousand and all of a sudden where he was weeping where he was fearful where he was afraid where he was uncertain just a little while before because of unfortunate circumstances and situations of now david has squared his shoulders back he's got his head held up and he says I feel like I can run through troop and by my god leave over a wall praise God that's real encouraging yourself in the Lord absolutely I'm many many times we have to reach that place we do that we just think about what God has done for us in the past and it reminds me of that beautiful passage in the book of Revelation that the testimony of Jesus mm-hmm is this the spirit of prophecy yes sir did you know there's many that do not quite understand the full application of that passage but a testimony is something that has already taken place okay prophecy often was something that's going to take place in the future and so one of the beautiful applications of that verse is that what God has done is proof and evidence that he will do it again hallelujah praise because the testimony of Jesus is heals the spirit of prophecy if somebody can testify eyes of the blind have been open right that the ears of the Deaf have been unstopped lesser that the lame have walked up that the dead have been raised to life again those testimonies are also prophecies that he will do it again I am so thankful that today we are not serving a God who used to be a mom or a god who was or a God who might be but we are serving a God who is one of the most beautiful things of about the testimony of Moses of is the fact that he said who shall I say sent me and God said you tell Pharaoh I am since you I am what I am bread when you're hungry I am water when you're thirsty I am strength when you're weak I am a light when you're in darkness I am a way when there seems to be no way I'm a husband to the widow I'm a father to the orphan I'm a doctor in the sick room God the ears of my anything and everything that we ever need him to be exactly exactly I am I am that covers a lot absolutely and so it is that as David thought about these things he naturally encouraged himself to the point that he decided I want to I want to pray I want to inquire after the Lord concerning what is going to go on and the scripture tells us in verse 7 and David said to a buyeth or the priest a hymn elack's son I pray thee bring me hither the ephod and a by authorial further the ephod to David and David inquired at the Lord saying shall I pursue after this true man shall I overtake them and he answered him pursue for thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover Oh notice that David pointedly asks God two questions number one he wanted to know shall I pursue after this troop and number two if you do want me to pursue am I going to be able to overtake them right and here's the beautiful thing that I would like to point out that when David inquired at the Lord the response of God did not come moments later it did not come minutes or hours or days or weeks or months or years right right sometimes we inquire of the Lord and we inquire of him over and over time and again and in some cases we're still waiting on a response yes however David inquired at the Lord and the response of God was immediate why was the response of God immediate because the heaven was open you understand that once the heaven opens of we can inquire at the Lord and the response many times will be an immediate response of God immediately said pursue for thou shalt surely overtake them Don could have stopped that could have been the end of the situation or that could have been the end of the subject because David only wanted to know number one shall I pursue after them and number two shall i overtake them however because the heaven was open God said not only am I going to answer both questions but I'm gonna go one step farther he said David yes I want you to pursue yes I am going to enable you I'm going to empower you I'm going to allow you to be able to overtake them however third of all I'm gonna also give you the ability to get back or to recover everything that has been lost yes sir oh my my how important that is today yes not only to know that number one God did want David to pursue right I've thought about it even earlier today I cannot find one place anywhere in all of our entire holy scripture where God said that as a Christian as a believer we are supposed to be spending our life running from the death no sir it's not in here however I remember back in the 1980s hearing somebody to testify one night in the middle of a service how difficult and how hard it was and how how terribly difficult and taxing it was because the devil had been after them all day long fact is I remember very well this particular person asking the church and the minister especially would you please pray for me because the devil has been riding my back all day long and I just don't know if I'm gonna be able to make it or not and I remember as a young man thinking in my own mind this is not the way it's supposed to see somehow I began to realize that if we take the saddle off yeah devil might not ride us so you know there amen there's not one place in all of the scripture where God says as his children as his beloved as his bride as a royal priesthood as a holy nation as a peculiar people that we are supposed to be running from our adversary fact iou's of our adversary is supposed to be running from us absolutely man it is high time for somebody somewhere to stand a sir realize exactly who they are but more importantly than who they are we need to realize who's we are and then because when we realize who's we are we can begin to understand that we have not only Authority but we also have power amen over all of the power of the enemy amen and we are not supposed to be running from the enemy but the enemy is literally supposed to be running from us amen that is why God said yes I want you to pursue I don't want you to spend the rest of your life running from an adversary but I want you to pursue that adversary and not only are you going to pursue but yes I'm going to enable you and allow you to overtake that adversary and once you overtake them I'm going to allow you to recover everything that has been taken Wow absolutely that's incredible I don't remember how you said you got the three words how did those three words come to you as I was as I was praying and meditating in the presence of the Lord just about God saying that the heaven was now open the Lord said that this new year 2018 was going to be a year of restoration it was going to be a year of recovery and it was going to be a year of preparation and see restoration right really truly involves the spiritual man okay talk absolutely what God was trying to say to not just for me but for the people of God everywhere that have an ear to hear right remember we must have an area in order to be able to hear what the Spirit is saying to the church and restoration truly involves the act of moving from fellowship back to relationship see we have moved from the realm of relationship Adam and Eve had true relationship in the garden but because of the fall they moved from relationship inside of the garden to fellowship outside of the garden and did you know God is saying now what I truly want to do is I want my bride I want my people I want my church to move from fellow she okay outside of the garden back to relationships which is inside of the garden air-sea fellowship is in the living room but relationship is behind closed doors fellowship is with everyone around joint but relationship is when you become one with the one who created you I really like to say it like this that we move from fellowship to relationship when we finally decide to get out of the supper-room and move back into the upper room I pray Scotty man we get out of the supper room and we decide to move back into the Upper Room why is that because when we fellowship sometimes we don't understand the importance of not just word but spirit yes also sometimes we get just word and when we have just word the Bible tells us that the letter alone does what it kills in that right here letter alone killeth amen but the Spirit does what the Spirit gives life amen did you know that sometimes when we have just the word we dry up oh yeah and we see many that's on that extreme and then you go to the other extreme and you see those who have spirit alone and me and when you have spirit alone there's no foundation there's no substance there's no root and with the Spirit alone you blow up isn't that right it is but Oh Matt when you marry the word and the spirit when they join together and become one you don't dry up and you don't blow up but praise God you grow amen and that is exactly what he wants us to do that's what he wants to restore to the body of Christ yes sir he wants to restore relationship because it's relationship that enables us and allows us to grow up and that's the spirit man Wow but God said I'm not only concerned about the spiritual side of you God said I'm also concerned about the natural side of you I believe that I want to I want to enable you and allow you to recover I want to give back to you the physical things that you have lost them I mean because the thief comes in to do what to kill to steal and to destroy however jesus said I am come that you might have one life and have it more abundantly and so he truly cares about not only the spiritual satisfying he can he cares about the natural side Jesus himself says but seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you yes I remember when the light finally turned on and I began to understand that if I will put God first he delights in adding all of these other things to me grace I'm a father and you're a father and you know what we delight yes yes giving our children your natural things that they won't or desire how much more our heavenly father the lights and desires to give us the things in this life that we enjoy when we put him first man when we put him first all he really wants us to do is just allow him to be number one allow him to have preeminence in our life and when he has preeminence when he is first and we put him first and we seek after his kids yes he said I'm just going to naturally allow all of these other things to be added unto you he said David if you pursue not only am I gonna allow you to overtake your enemy but once you overtake them I'm going to allow yes sir to recover all of the physical things yes Lord that have been lost remember that God that gave to job in the end twice as much as he had in the beginning remember in the beginning he lost what seven thousand sheep three thousand camel five hundred yoke of oxen five hundred donkeys he lost a household of male and female servants in their item of course he did and imagine the enemy thought now that he's lost all of that he's gonna quit he's gonna give up he's gonna turn back he's gonna walk away but you know what job did not quit job did not turn back Joe did not walk away no sir he thought it can't get much darker than this however the last the last surviving servant would come and say job your seven sons and three daughters were feasting in the house of the eldest brother when a wind came smote the four corners of the house it fell in it was so sudden that not one of your children were able to escape job I hate to bear to you the bad news however all 10 of your children are now dead can you imagine what a dark day that must have been I don't want to imagine that you know I could not imagine the grief of losing one child much less all of my children right at one time you would think that job would quit yes sir you would think that he would throw in the towel you would think that he would become angry and charge God bitterly however we remember exactly what he did the Bible said that he shaved his head he went his mantle off' and he fell down on the ground and he did what he didn't complain he wasn't angry he wasn't upset he didn't wrestle or struggle with the question why he didn't say god this is not fair the Bible said he worship worship he worshiped saying naked came I into this world and naked shall I return thither he said the LORD hath given and the LORD hath taken away but blessed be the name of the Lord the recovery always comes in the life of a believer when we decide regardless of what we've lost like regardless of how painful and how dark and how devastating us might be I'm still gonna give my praise to the God that created worthy I'm still gonna lift up mine eyes in that what David said under the hills of from whence cometh my help because my help comes from where the Lord who made heaven and earth remember today help never comes o when your head is hung down up looking at the ground of help always comes when we live no matter how dark it is no matter how bad you may feel lift your eyes up to the heavens because help is on the way Amen recovery is on the way for the people of God yes recovery is on the way for the bride of crime and somebody said why is recovery not only of natural things and restoration restoring a relationship as far as the spiritual man is concerned why is that so vitally important because restoring relationship and recovering the natural things in this life that we have lost is going to prepare us to be empowered and positioned for the mighty last move to the last stage I'm I'm and that is exactly what we are in store for I mind that was the third word the third promise for 2018 what's preparation preparation and see God is preparing us jesus said these works shall you do and greater works than these hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah that's and so it is that what God was trying to say to me as an individual not just for my personal ministry but also for all of the people of God all around the globe that number one he desires to restore our relationship yes you do he desires for us to move from the outside of the garden the fellowship back to the inside of the garden which is relationship he desires for us to you know get out of the courtyard and get out of the holy place and move into the most holy place because that's where the presence of God that's where the weighty presence that's where the life-changing presence is at see when we move from fellowship to relationship we no longer have that testimony that every once in a great while we are stirred you know we go to church and a word stirs us when you're a testimony and it stirs us a song may stir us but oh my when we move from fellowship to relationship we are no longer stirred but we are changed and you know what the people of God are desperately seeking and waiting for the change to come on mama and so restoration is gonna bring that recover it is going to assist that and be a product of that restoration when we recover natural things that's just that's just an expression that's just proof that's just evidence that we have experienced restoration on the inside and this is going to prepare us what it's gonna do is it's gonna position us amen so that we can be empowered to reach this world unlike ever before wow what a wonderful word what a wonderful promise and all of that ties right back into the open heaven absolutely mm-hmm so it wasn't just for the tenth meeting we're not in our it was it was a prophetic released word absolutely absolutely and it is amazing again we have been seen evidence of this in all of our meetings since it just seems like that up every meeting that we've had from that time just seems to be getting greater and greater more and more powerful and we just keep seeing more and more miraculous things unfold and our hearts are filled with great expectancy in my mind we are filled with great expectancy it just reminds me so much of how Peter and John were leaving the Upper Room they were on their way to the temple for prayer and as they were passing through that beautiful gate there was that lame man less they're begging arms right and as they started to pass through that gate Peter and John look at the lame man and they said fasten your eyes upon us no doubt from a carnal standpoint the lame men must have thought these two men I feel really generous today and they are just about to bless me in a way like I've never been blessed he was thinking in a monetary way however he must have been suddenly disappointed when Peter would say silver and gold have I none but what I want to point out is before he said that the Bible said that the lame men did what the lame man fastened his eyes upon him the Bible said that the lame man looked up expecting to receive something from them hallelujah mine did you know in order for us to receive restoration in order for us to receive recovery good in order for us to walk in preparation in order for us to be positioned and empowered by the presence of God that we must be expecting to receive something from him mama the Bible said that the lame man looked up expecting to receive something from them and I think that in this hour there is a tremendous expectancy that is beginning to fill the atmosphere I really feel that I feel there's a tremendous expectancy that's just beginning to feel the atmosphere and people are expecting things that they've never seen with their eyes or heard with their ears after all what did he say I has not seen ear has not heard neither has it entered into the heart of man the things that God has paired for them do what who love you man sometimes we get so wrapped up in the basic survival of life that we forget we are serving a God who is able to do what exceedingly abundantly above anything that we could ask or think in this our God is filling the hearts of men with an expectancy for exceedingly abundantly hallelujah and so it is that when the lame man looked up expecting he was expecting silver and gold he was expecting a few coins in the bottom of a cup right right however Peter said silver and gold have I none I kind of like to say it like this no doubt Peter may have looked over at John and said you have revelation and I've got demonstration amen did you know in this hour of expectancy we need a marriage of of Revelation yes and demonstration on why because the Apostle Paul said I do not come to you with the enticing words of man's wisdom but in the power and the demonstration of the Holy Ghost story yes we need revelations are unlike ever before do we need ears to be able to hear the revelation of God like never before but at the same time to validate the revelation we need demonstration sir how long has it been since we were an eyewitness to real genuine Heaven Sent biblical demonstration of God's power and presence and so it is he said silver and gold have none but such as health now please notice at this moment how critical it is the reason in a lot of places that we are not seeing demonstration is because people don't have anything and when you don't have anything you cannot demonstrate any things right you cannot give if you have not first received a man no doubt jay-bez said bless me why because he understood how can I bless others unless I have first been blessed myself right how can I give to others unless I have first received something myself how can I demonstrate the miraculous how can I demonstrate the power and the presence of Almighty God if I have not been somewhere and received first myself oh my and so it is the lane men had no idea Peter and John had just walked out of the upper room Peter had just delivered the very first spirit-filled message to the church when he stood on the steps of of that upper room and declared this is that that was spoken by the Prophet Joe ala in the last days of hallelujah and so it is now he sells silver and gold have I none but such as I have give I under this in the name of Jesus Christ rise to your head and walk notice the Apostle Peter did not wait on the lame man to jump up and walk he did not wait for the lame man to embrace this and then act upon it the Bible said that he took the lame man by the hand and pulled him to his feet and immediately the lame man received strength of in his feet and his ankle bones and he went running and he went leaping and he went praising God into the temple imagine what they must have thought when this lame man came bursting into the temple shouting and worshipping and praising the Lord no doubt they quickly surrounded him and said look if you're gonna stay in here you're gonna have to sit down and you're gonna have to be quiet and you're gonna have to hold your peace of because of you are not allowed to do that's not temple protocol at this moment amen that's not temple protocol at this moment however I've got a real good feeling that the lame man must've looked at those surrounding him and said don't you recognize Who I am and as much as you would like for me to sit down and as much as you would like for me to be quiet and as much as you would like for me to hold my peace I've got a real good feeling that Lane man must have said that I can't sit on there because I just got up I've got a real good feeling there's some people up in God's church that are just about to declare I can't sit down because I just got up imagine that balloon man was exactly like another lame man who went to church with his back on a bed but after one touch up he went home with a beard on his back I'm telling you miraculous Amman can unfold the demonstration of God's power can overtake you in one brief moment of if you will just simply a look up expecting to receive something from here Wow surely you must be expecting after hearing a word from the Lord like that surely that must have elevated your faith to another level you have 45 seconds to lead us in a prayer were you doing father we love you today asking right now in the
