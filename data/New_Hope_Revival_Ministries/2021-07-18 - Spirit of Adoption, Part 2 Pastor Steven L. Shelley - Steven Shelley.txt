like to go to the lord in prayer we have a lot to go to the lord today but he knows every need but uh if if anybody have any unspoken prayer crashed by just the uplifting of the hand there's needs all over the building but he knows every single one of them before we even before we even came this morning or he knows continue to pray for brother steve curry today and their service that god would be with them brother greeley's service in virginia uh pray for sister joyce and her time with her mom and the family there that god will let there be peace and uh just a wonderful atmosphere in a very difficult time there is a brother who has reached out several times now from south africa on behalf of his wife sister portia davies and she has been fighting headaches they're believers she's been fighting headaches for three months and now there's some kind of a lump or growth or something that has come up in her throat and she's asking the lord for a miracle and her husband on her behalf brother azel from pakistan has reached out friday and again today his precious little daughter cherith rose is uh in the hospital now and i don't know if they know exactly what's wrong with her but he sent a picture she's very ill they need to know what's wrong and they need to be able to treat her but most of all we need the lord to touch her and to help her and one other request is that we would know the lord's perfect will concerning the setting of meetings among the amish believers they have sent a set of dates for next month we need the lord's perfect will it's a long trip or someone who's overcoming back trouble but if that's the lord's perfect will and this is his timing we want to walk in it so ask the lord to reveal his perfect will for those precious people there yes there's a lot of needs and a lot to pray about today yes there is i know who can take care of it no one can touch you like jesus can no one can give you peace [Music] no one can touch you like jesus no one can give you peace [Music] would you mind coming this morning and praying no one can give you [Music] one can peace your wounds [Music] with jesus lord your presence is so powerful now my thoughts went to the word where satan's saying he will ascend and he will set himself at the throne of the most high yet we know there is only one god there is only one source for all of our needs and you the whole sufficient you you just condescend to us and you just call us in you say just lay them at my feet i will take care of them [Music] oh we thank you so much oh god so many needs oh god healing in our bodies lord healing in our emotions or but there are nothing for you you're the all-sufficient one yes sir and we're in you you chose to live in us oh my god there's nothing that can't be done nothing that can't be done lord we lay him at your feet oh god we lay the service at your feet oh god there is nothing more wonderful that should have any preeminence over your word oh god lord open our ears open our hearts lord let us each feel your presence let us hear the word that your servant brings to us oh god it is for our perfecting lord it is for this time it is for us to be strengthened to go out and give you glory lord use each one of us oh god as we row out into this world of darkness lord let us be light let us hide that word in our heart that we may serve you and give you glory lord there is no other there is no other this is worthy so lord we lay it all down at your feet and because you are who you are without hesitation we say thank you because we know you will have have the perfect answer it may not be ours but it is the perfect answer because it comes from you we love you so much lord bless each one o god let your bride just hear it in every situation hear your word and

believe that's the word of the lord clap your hands i want to thank you lord for everything you've accomplished on our behalf isn't he good to us you may be seated for another moment or two this morning it's wonderful to see you in the house of the lord and brother david man thank you so much and i don't know who helped you you want to tell us who helped you nathan and chad helping brother david mann yesterday to install the air conditioner unit thank you brothers for that so much how we appreciate that [Applause] i know you'll be more comfortable as you come in and as you leave the service and i hope that doesn't mean you'll stay longer in the bathroom i hope you'll come on in here uh but at least when i walked in there after a service i was really feeling for the mothers and the little babies and things like that and i know there are people who are cold natured we had some complaining last weekend but what we were doing was running them a little cooler in the back to try to make up for for the vestibules so always bring a shawl or a wrap or a blanket or an overcoat or something because you might be a little different blooded than the rest and we want you to be comfortable too it's not we didn't sit set out to try to make you uncomfortable i assure you of that and uh so please keep that in mind we're so thankful to be here this morning and the presence of the lord i had a big surprise right before the service i overheard ben asking joshua to lead the service it's certainly not the first time you've asked him is it many many many times he's asking and every time the answer is not not now or no or i can't this morning or i don't have time not prepared not ready whatever and so this morning he said yes and i think he did a great job appreciate it so much and there wasn't enough time to change keys to get the right key to make it so we just we just slid into it but i appreciate it sure uh we'll let benjamin will you take the mic we won't make joshua well maybe joshua to take it he'll be down there close let joshua take it it's his word it's his word hallelujah praise god praise god thank you jesus joshua when you first started singing i kept hearing my spirit you've won this battle he's won this battle so many things have been spoken over you and we've all prayed for you to take your rightful place and we knew that it was coming soon but this morning was so amazing and the lord said this battle is over hallelujah you have won the victory glory you chose the hard way and you have overcome hallelujah so don't worry about it you're stepping into your rightful place and know that god's going to be with you every step of the way don't back down now amen amen amen amen amen oh thank you jesus hallelujah praise the lord you know everybody has their tests and trials and they're on our level they're hand-picked for us your trial might not even move me i might not even slow down for your trial you might not even think mine is a trial you see how it works they're custom made i don't want to brag on them do you but they serve a great purpose in us and the spirit of the lord came down here tuesday night in such a profound and precious way and the enemy gets stirred and he stirs us in our emotions and after the service emotions were raw and there were some words exchanged some little little heated moments among some of the youth but you know the lord is good in all of that and he sometimes allows us to get in that place so we can check check on ourselves see where we are what's really moving in us and i find out that most of the time when something like that arises uh it's a little bit of both both going through a trial both going through a struggle or something and it kind of comes out that way but you know what i'm so glad that god's not done with us when we fail him we just have to come to him and say lord have mercy uh do our best to try to make it right with one another and keep on keeping on someone asked me recently said well what what do you do if there's somebody who just won't seem to forgive you you just keep on going you do what's right you do what's right try to make it but just keep right on going don't ever look back if you'd like quotes i have dozens just keep on going he said just keep on going pleasing him if you please him you will be all right you'll be all right amen tomorrow is brother joel ryder's birthday and he is streaming with his wife in south africa so we are just sending a happy birthday to brother joe a great friend of ours a great friend of the ministries and uh the only other birthday i have this week is an important birthday too but it's the only other one i have if i'm missing one you can tell me in just a moment you know because i want to know i really do and if we miss an anniversary we want to know that we want to try to get it down but next saturday is sister judith's birthday and most most folks around here a lot of the youth anyway refer to her as juju and uh we love her so much she is serving her parents uh in canada she is believing the lord for to make a way and for circumstances to come together so that she could join us in the near future but she is a busy lady there and uh they have gone through such weather extremes so dry we've had a very wet summer here they've had a very dry summer there and very very hot and most of the believers there do not have air conditioning but they do have basements so they go down in those basements and they get a little bit cooler but i want you to know i got a feeling i'd still be hot in the basement and but god brought them through and a lot of those saints who stream our services are elderly past their 80s and some getting closer to 90 and god has been good and he's been faithful so we send our love to all of them and we heard from juju again yesterday and we want to say in advance happy birthday to her may god just bless her abundantly let me announce this while you're seated and you can make note of it and uh as far as we know right now next sunday night we will be having a service in lagrange and it's the first time that i have been to a service there and they've asked us to speak and i heard after we announced this that there were a lot of you going to be gone next weekend one of our biggest families and now uh in-laws to boot and we're going to miss you terribly and we hate hate that it works out that you take half the church with you when you go but that's just the way it is we wouldn't want to lose you either so we're going to need some of the rest of you that are not yantis and graves related to please go along with us and help us in lagrange and i say that because i know brother robert that a good amount of you all would be there i know that that's the reason why i'm even making a point to mention it is i know that a good amount of you would be there so we've got to fill in uh and i would hope that you would do that in support of your pastor but more than that to support brother steve and sister anita and their little church begins revival the next weekend and i may have it wrong but i think it begins on friday night and saturday night and the brother mark hall is coming an old friend of mine and the curries and he's coming to hold services there for them with his son and uh we're going to try to go up if we can it's our heart's desire to do that we have company coming in but we're hoping we can just take them with us and uh so the service next sunday night will be at six o'clock and it is at the pentecostal church of lagrange the pentecostal church of lagrange and the uh address is 82. don't text me later for this if you can if you can jot it down would you do it and if not we will post it for you on the facebook page so you can see the address i don't know the zip code but it is 82 chase road 82 chase road lagrange georgia do you know where it is sister flo all right the pentecostal church of lagrange 82 chase road lagrange georgia six o'clock and we'll do our best to get out of here by four next sunday and that'll give you time to eat on the way drive through and be there by six o'clock come and be a blessing to those people ain't god good give us so many my trials are tailor made they're made for me with zachary's name on them he wants to know brother richard what's the address you meant that in the most respectful way didn't you 82 chase road lagrange come be with us if you possibly can next sunday night let's stand together i don't want to take time uh and shine on something too much that's going on with us personal but july the 4th of 2020 we had a flood and when i say flood i don't mean a trickle i mean a flood in our house and uh it has been a long trial and but i want to thank the lord for alpha i do i hear people complaining about alpha insurance and they may have treated you terrible but they treated us amazing and they would uh they ended up settling for us for a lot of money and uh because they they figured we would not be able to patch our floor again because it had already been patched and they wanted to give us a brand new solid wood floor like we had and that is in the master bedroom the master closet the hallway uh the dining room and the living room that's a lot of wood floor and my wife had the incredible idea that we would do a lot of the work so that in the end of this we could get a little that money and uh i don't know if everybody who was helping us agreed to that or not but i want to thank every one of you who have just come and helped us uh even helped us move some things all my furniture is quite old but it is solid cherry and it is it's so heavy that the drawers are heavy to carry a drawer is heavy and they're solid as well and we just appreciate the help so much it's up all of it's up as of last night we slept on mattresses and box springs on the floor and stacy and i did and the new flooring is supposed to be coming in this week and i mean it's in it's sitting in our living room it's supposed to be going in this week and we just hope that everything will go smooth and we can have it behind us after a solid year it would be wonderful to have that finished it's hard to complain when you're getting a brand new floor but it's it i have to tell you it grieves me to see that good floor getting ripped up it it does and i'm not a tree hugger but i stood there thinking these trees will never be replaced why can't this be reused why can't something be done with this but anyway that's the way it works sometimes we don't understand but don't ever let your wife talk you into something like that if the insurance is willing to pay for it let them pay for it and you move into a hotel i give you that that final piece of advice the last thing i want to share with you i've been putting it off for two weeks now because of time and i'm going to take this moment to thank you from the bottom of my heart for praying with us concerning my mother and her medicaid and it has also been a long battle ms sherry at the nursing home told me this week ashley that she had never seen a harder battle for medicaid than the one that we had just went through but mother has been completely approved and not only that of course you know we there at the beginning of the year we had to kick in a substantial amount of money to keep her there personally while medicaid was kicking in but i got the phone call this week to say you don't owe us another penny all of that is settled and uh i can't tell at all but anyway they even gave us a small blessing that they were able to give us to help us in the future and i want to thank you for praying it was a long process but god is good so i thank you and want to thank the lord [Applause] it's his grace [Applause] isaiah chapter 9 sister evelyn is so good to see you i see you're suffering with your knee i'm so sorry we're going to pray for you and if you do have to move around move around all you need to move around and we understand that totally and completely we'll take you any way we can get you this morning we're glad to have you here isaiah chapter nine beginning in verse six and thank you musicians for all you've done i i won't try to sing now i took my time but god bless you for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever the zeal of the lord of hosts will perform this while you're standing permit me to read verse six again for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace lord jesus we bow our heads before you as our master as our maker as our savior we acknowledge your goodness to us we acknowledge who you are and what you have accomplished on our behalf and now lord we are approaching your word today it's life to us its strength its help its guidance how we need that in uncertain days like the ones in which we are living we don't ask you to anoint what is already anointed eternally but we ask you to anoint our hearts and our ears that we might receive the word and anoint your servant that he might give your word forth as you have called me to do lord anoint your people that we might take it that it might root in us and that it might accomplish the things that it is sent forth into the earth to accomplish through us and we will give you glory and honor and praise for it's in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen and the saint said amen you may be seated i did mean to mention one thing that inspired me yesterday and that was brother steve polk came to help us get started and to help the brothers know how to run the machine and the time came he just had lingered and lingered and the time came that he was going to leave us and he said i'm going to pray and he knelt down on the hardwood floor and prayed that god would help each one that was going to help to get that floor up and i want you to know every one of us before the day was over we acknowledged that it was that prayer and it was god who answered that prayer that it helped them be able to do what they did we we we hit some hard streaks but they found some spots and when they hit an easy street we were given god pray thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord thank you brother steve for praying and you know he he tells us that on his job he does that everywhere he goes to work on the floor he prays like that and i want you to know it makes a difference and it acknowledges god to me it's like the jew who wears the keeper on his head to acknowledge that there's a god above him and when you kneel down like that maybe even seen by by those who live in the home it says i serve a god that sits above it all that's the testimony we all want to have can you say amen isaiah prophesied 600 some say 700 years before messiah was born that there was going to come a child there was going to come a son there was going to come one who would be wonderful and counselor mighty god and the everlasting father the prince of peace don't don't miss that because it gives us a great prophetic understanding of the godhead he's not only the son but he is the everlasting father there's only one being talked about in isaiah chapter nine and verse six it's not two different persons or three different persons here in the godhead but that same son that is given that also is the everlasting father it also is the child that's born to us the one upon whom shoulders the whole government of god would sit upon we're blessed to know him if you believe we're blessed to know him today say amen i didn't say just know about him we're blessed to know him in an intimate way by the spirit of adoption we are allowed to call him papa god abba father not just our father but my father there's power in that there's power in understanding the relationship that god has made available to us with him in luke chapter 2 if you will look there with me a moment we're talking about again today the spirit of adoption this would be the spirit of adoption part well really part three uh but i guess we could say part two because we didn't get very far on tuesday night but the lord took us somewhere anyway so maybe we would just title this part two on the spirit of adoption one of the seven offices or administrations of the holy ghost in the personal and individual life of the believer perhaps one of the most important because this is the anointing that sets us as sons it places us in sonship it it reestablishes the truth that we have been delivered from slavery we have been delivered from bondage galatians tells us and we have been brought into a glorious kingdom translated peter talks about how we are translated into a greater kingdom and one that is not of darkness can you say amen one that is of light and this is god's gift to us luke chapter 2 and verse 52 and jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with god and man let me read it again and jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with god and man if he were god do you believe he was god do you believe he was the word made flesh do you believe that all that was in the father was in him he would be fullness then wouldn't he he is in fact the express image of god and the entirety of the godhead the bible tells us that the entirety of the godhead dwelt in him it dwelt in his physical form but for some reason he wasn't born with it all i want you to think about the process he wasn't born in completion he who would be complete he who would be absolutely the perfect god man stay with me just a moment he who would be the first perfect god man god in spirit man in fleshly body and yet there was a process there was a development there was a growing up that had to take place in his life somebody said to me recently i don't understand why god chose to do it that way i do and i'm not a very smart man but i know why god chose to do it that way he chose to do it that way for me he chose to do it that way for you because he was looking for a patterned son he was to become a pattern son one that you and i could look at his life and pattern our life after his life knowing that if he who was god in the flesh would be born without the total completion and manifestation of what had been prophesied of him but he would grow and he would come up into the stature of the perfect man we look at that and we say if he had to do it and did it by the grace of god he turns around and said because i did because i was able you are also able the carnal answer is yeah but he was god yeah but he was man you understand yes he was god but he was man i'm going to give you some some quotations in a little while that will help you to see what god was really doing he was showing why don't you help me this morning he was showing himself approachable he was showing himself in such a way that you and i can look at him and say my if he could grow up into something then i can grow up into something as long as i've got the same spirit in me that he had in him same spirit again we look at it and we say oh but he was god yes but he was man he was growing into something did you know he had to receive the baptism of the holy ghost he was all god yet he was all man he had to have the same infusion you see he received who god was as an earnest when he was created in the womb of mary to become a begotten son he received an earnest of all that he would be when you are born again through repentance through justification the process of the new birth begins you receive an earnest of what you will one day carry the fullness of you get enough of the spirit of god and your repentance and in your conversion to lead you to guide you to direct you to bring you to all truth the bible said but you can't get by without the baptism of the holy ghost it's not just an infilling it's not just god filling us up but it's god filling us up and then plunging us beneath the holy ghost we are baptized in the spirit just like we are immersed in baptism with water it's the same typology it speaks of the same thing and so jesus born a special child we've talked about it so many times even the father created the egg placed it in mary's womb so he already had a benefit that his cousin didn't have that all of his half siblings would not have that no other man ever born among women among men would have something that had never happened before who do you think could believe such a thing i do and i do it not by my smarts i believe it by faith and by the witness of his word and by the witness of his spirit if you know where i am say amen what a blessing it is to know what god has done for us we were singing of how far he went how much he valued us how much he loved us that he went all the way on our behalf praise god but he was a patterned son he had to increase in wisdom that means he wasn't born with all wisdom i thought he was the word made flesh he was i thought he was god he was but he was not born with all wisdom why because god designed it that way he was not born as tall as he was going to be this is not just his physical stature but it's also his stature and influence among the people but neither of them were where they were going to be when he was just a little child in the temple oh he marveled them he astonished them he was a special child no doubt but unlike the movies portray he wasn't a miracle-working little teenager he was living a rather ordinary life because he had to live long enough to be tempted in all manner help me preach somebody he had to live long enough to be tempted in all manner even as we are yet without sin so he had to increase in wisdom and stature and even in favor with god how could you be god in flesh and not come forth with the fullness of the favor of god isaiah tells us i just read it to you the scripture said for unto us a child is given that's yelled it means a child it just means that it it's in in ancient hebrew or in biblical hebrew it actually refers to a young male child it's not a genderless word it's a gendered word and it means a boy a youth a small child so for unto us a child is given or born excuse me for unto us a child is born but that child had to increase come on in wisdom that child had to increase in stature that child had to increase in favor he had to increase by obeying more and more and more as the father would require more and more and more of him why because he was going through the same process that you and i as believers would go through it's the adoption process it's the work of the spirit of adoption in our life where one day the father will be able to say about you and i this this is my beloved son in whom i am pleased to dwell in hear ye him i heard you brother robert when you were praying up here you talked about the bride hearing the word and speaking the word with courage with boldness and i want you to know that's exactly what god is depending on you and i to do and there's coming an hour that we will know that we know that we know that we have graduated to that place where our words are no longer influenced by our opinions and our emotions but a bride emerging with thus saith the lord and he told us without that without thus saith the lord she will hold her peace you know that's the hardest part doing nothing in the spirit not in the natural in the natural doing nothing is easy some of us are experts at it right but in the spirit doing nothing but standing standing in faith refusing to budge refusing to compromise what you know god has made real to you i'm telling you it's harder than the person who's always doing something for the kingdom busy busy busy busy busy busy it's wonderful to do that and you should do it when you know what god would have you to do you should be busy when you know what god is calling you to do you should be up and about the father's business but there are times that we just have to stand because we're coming to an hour we're growing up into a relationship we're growing up into a stature of the perfect man where we will speak with all heaven's authority amen and i'm telling you you know he tells us in the message of the hour that the very voice of the resurrection will be in the bride somebody said we've sure got some growing up to do we sure do but we got the one in us hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we've got the one in us who knows how to grow us up he knows how to hand pick he knows how to choose situations and circumstances to grow us up then as we mentioned last week are you with me i should feel you then and then as we mentioned last week there is an acceleration that has been prophesied with our maturity and we're thinking every one of us are thanking god for that but it doesn't mean we get a shortcut it just means that one of these days while standing in faith while holding our position in faith the spirit of the lord screams advance and we take something that we've left laying on the table for all these years we hear the spirit saying advance and we rush to take a hold of the promise of god and we do it in such a manner that the enemy's huffing and puffing and blowing at our doesn't even move us we are not moved so the bride is really in the most difficult place that she's ever been in she's in a place where in so many ways god is saying hold your ground stand still don't lose any ground but just hold still be faithful you know you can't sometimes you feel like i can't do much let me tell you something you can do you can be faithful i'm not going to argue with people about sleeping in church and i'm not going to argue with people about being faithful to church you know what the word said and if you don't know you know what the message of the hour said you've heard the same quotes that i've heard you know what god how the prophet taught us to respect what's going on up here the bride is in a very difficult place in this hour because sometimes we all feel like we're just in limbo we're just not really taking a lot of ground not gaining in a lot of authority but i want you to know you be faithful if you can't be a lot of things you can be faithful i want to say again if you can't be a lot of things if you can't do a lot of things you can be faithful you can be faithful to god and you know what you can be faithful to come not only come to the house of god but to come with the right spirit it's so important i want to tell you something i don't want to be one of those sitting in a service walling my eyes rolling my eyes around because i don't like what somebody's doing or saying or how they're acting or how they're dressed or how weird they i don't want to do that because i've read too many descriptions too many descriptions of the hour that will approach us just before all of heaven is backing us up and i don't want to be caught up in that because the bible tells us that we'll see the days of ananias and sapphira i'm not making a threat i don't have to i'm just standing on what the prophet said and in fact sister el frida can tell you we've been standing on that promise looking for that day since way before some of you were ever here god talked to us about that in the early 90s and it's going to be one of the final things that causes the bride to be squeezed into a place of total i mean total surrender and you say well i just didn't think that fear was what was going let me tell you something there's more than one kind of fear the fear of man will you but the fear of the lord will increase you the fear of the lord will honor you the fear of the lord will advance you if you know i'm preaching the truth you could say man it's the word of almighty god and we're coming we're coming we don't know when we have no idea don't ask we don't know when it's going to break forth but i'm listening i'm listening for a call that says advance i'm listening for a call that says you've stood you've stood on the word you've stood in position you've held your ground advance hallelujah and it doesn't matter on that day how many giants stand before us through the lord by his spirit we'll just walk right through the enemy pushing him over you know it's a promise you know it's coming so for unto us here is here is the reason here is how we know why jesus had to increase in wisdom and stature and in favor with god and man because this is how isaiah prophesied his coming would be for unto us a child is born a yelid a little boy he wasn't first a child but he was a child he was first a baby but he became a child when he was standing there teaching in the temple he was just stepping from childhood into a little bit of adolescence just coming up into that next stage that middle he's not an adult he's still a boy but he but he said he's advancing in wisdom and evidently his limited wisdom was greater than all the wisdom of the teachers of the law if he was able to astonish them with a portion of god's favor with a portion of god's wisdom and stature then they really must have been suffering in such an hour as that and we're told in history that there was great great corruption in the priesthood of the second temple period he was baffling them and astonishing them with only a portion of the wisdom that he would one day have and a portion of the knowledge that he would one day have but isaiah said for unto us a child is born and the next phrase lets us know he won't always be a child he won't always be a yellid if we're in greek he won't always be a technon one of these days he's going to be a wheels because he's going to experience adoption and the word adoption in greek is the we official which is the very science the very unfolding the very knowledge of being placed as a son it comes as a download and we receive it by faith and step up into that position into the fullness of the wisdom into the fullness of the stature into the fullness of the favor with god and with man so even though it's one jesus we're talking about here one jesus here he was first a child born into this world with only a limit a limited amount of the fullness a token amount of the fullness that he would one day carry but the prophet didn't stop there he said also unto us a son is given now that word sun is the word that means just that sun it's the word ben b-e-n so when you see the word benjamin it means son of my right hand when you're reading and it says so and so been judah the son of judah and so that word son means someone and let me tell you something little children were not usually mentioned as being the son of the father until they had graduated to something more than childhood in a genealogy when when a sun is mentioned it's usually referring to a child that is grown up and the one who is the heir notice all the sons are not mentioned but it's usually the oldest not always they're exceptions it's usually the oldest and it's usually the one that has grown up to take the place of the father that's mentioned in the genealogy not a child but a son so isaiah let us know if we could have been listening to isaiah's prophecy we would have known he will come to the earth as a child but god's gift to us will not just be the giving of a child but it will be the giving of a son one who has passed the test one who has increased in wisdom one who has grown in stature and in favor with god and man perfect and yet not in total completion until he continued to grow excuse me to grow and to manifest all that the father had designed him to do are you with me praise the lord i'm so glad i'm so thankful that the yell it became a bend that the child that was born also became a given son god gave us a son god gave me a son and adopted son one who would prove himself and it would be witnessed publicly this is the one that i have chosen to live in to dwell in and to conduct my business in and through are you still with me good because we've got a lot of ground to cover and if you're worn out now i don't know how you'll make it the rest of the day matthew chapter 3 verse 16 and 17 it speaks to us of the lord's baptism and i want you to know there's a lot that was going on in that baptism that we might have missed in our church life but we're not missing it in our identity as a part of his bride we're recognizing that god was doing something publicly that day he was showing the world the work that he had intended for the son and jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw who saw jesus saul the spirit of god descending not a dove descending the spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him you talk about identification do you believe there were other you believe there were other children there that day do you believe there were other men there that day other women there that day but god didn't identify himself with those other men and women he identified himself with how many only one he marked him by the spirit descending as a dove and it lit upon him i love the word does anybody else in here love the word have you picked it up this week have you fed on it this week it's life to us it's life it changes a lot it changes everything really doesn't it and this and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him and lo a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved or beloved son in whom i am well pleased if you look at that word beloved it's a whole lot like agape it's agapitos which means dearly beloved a dear esteemed worthy of love and the last definition of the beloved is favorite you want to know who the father's favorite was he identified him that day it was only on our lord that the spirit descended like a dove it was only over our lord that the voice spoken said from heaven this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased now look at matthew 17 i wish you would have your bible if your bible is there use it this morning would you because we're going to every one of these in the gospel matthew chapter 17 it's 12 41 matthew chapter 17 verse 5 while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them does anybody know anything about a bright cloud cloud by day and fire by night was this not the glory of the lord descending sure it was and behold a voice where did the voice come from from above from the cloud and what did the voice say this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased would you read the next three words hear him what i read for you this morning in reading matthew 3 16 and 17 and matthew 17-5 is i read to you the beginning and the ending of our lord's adoption process it began though he were a son he was always a beloved of the father he was always god in the flesh and yet there was a union that had to take place i'll read it in a moment in fact brother branham says up until this point he was just a man that's hard for me to get my head around but i'm just telling you what a prophet said from the word he said he was just a man up until this point but on this day the father identified this man as being an offspring a son of god now how was he the son of god because the seed of god was in him how did he get there come on god put it there did you know you're a son of god did you know if you're a son of god the seed of god dwells in you if the seed of god dwells in you how they together god put it in there it was his to give it was his seed you are his offspring jesus was announced that day as not just a radical prophet this isn't even another john the baptist i want you to know they were looking at john the baptist like a crazy man and the father wanted him to know i'm identifying this one right here as my very own beloved son and i want you to know i'm pleased with my son and i'm pleased to live in my son that was the beginning of the adoption process that even a child the child the offspring of god had to go through so that he would become the given son it's powerful if we can see that even isaiah was prophesying of something he didn't fully understand but we who have the gospels we can look back and say this is exactly what he was telling us is that a child was going to be born but eventually a son was going to be given and i want to say to you today who studied i want to say to you that this day on the jordan river a son was given bethlehem was the fulfillment of the first part you got to watch these two-part prophecies brother richard you've got to watch them because remember there's another two-part prophecy that talks about the return of the spirit of elijah the same man didn't fulfill both of those prophecies it sounded like in prophecy that one man would do both jobs but it was two so you've got to watch those two-part prophecies and here we have another one for unto you a child is born but unto you a son is given and so that day in bethlehem when mary and that little baby came forth from her body and he was wrapped in swaddling clothes and laid in a manger the first part of isaiah's prophecy was fulfilled but it was not until years later he is standing in the jordan river with john the baptizer his cousin ready to baptize him and the voice of the father speaks out and says today i've already given you a child a child has already been born unto you but today i'm going to give you a son this is him i am pleased to dwell in him and i am identifying him as my heir are you not also identified as an heir indeed an heir of god and what joint heirs with jesus christ why because you're in the same process of adoption that even our lord had to go through increasing in wisdom and stature hebrews 5 8 you knew i'd have to get to that in a minute didn't you hebrews 5 8 though we were a son though we were a son though we were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered see paul knew it you see how paul recognized what was going on that a child was born and and now a son is given and then matthew 17 5 we just read it this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased hear ye him that is the completion that's the end of the adoption process the same work that's happening in us are you with me maybe i shouldn't have had you look at your bibles because you forget to look back up here but i thought that might help you to be able to see it let me read this to you from questions and answers on hebrews and answers on hebrews number two paragraph 386 this is one that was added this morning so to help you to find it there i want you to understand sonship from the father's perspective brother branham said or as i have went through it the catholic call it the eternal sonship of god you'd be surprised how many statements of faith you might look at i don't know if you ever look at them but before i sink one dollar into a ministry i like to know what they believe it's up to you how you do i know some people are always sending money over everywhere overseas everywhere and i don't do that because i want to know now you may you may be called on to support something that you don't agree with 100 that's fine we do that but i want to know and you would be surprised how many protestant churches ministries organizations will talk about in their statement of faith the catholic doctrine of the eternal sonship of jesus why should we be surprised because even the protestant churches are being formed to look more and more like their mother every day are you with me let's stand together for just a moment everyone that can hallelujah thank you jesus hallelujah lord we take this opportunity to praise you just a moment we take this opportunity just to stretch ourselves a moment to give you glory and honor and praise hallelujah to let you know how thankful we are for what you've done on our behalf oh jesus we could never thank you enough what's wrong with you can't you praise him we could never thank you enough oh for being such an example such a patterned son blessed be the name of the lord we give you glory we give you honor we give you praise for the lamb of god is worthy thou art worthy lord thou art worthy lord thou art worthy lord god bless every one of you you may be seated he said the catholic call it the eternal sonship of god which as i have said before the word doesn't even make sense he said see there cannot be an eternal son because a son had to have a beginning he was born a child before he became a son now we know trinitarian doctrine says something entirely different than that but if you can figure out how someone can always be a son and never have a creation or at least be birthed then we might look at what you have to say but even by understanding the simplicity of the words brother random said why this doesn't even make sense something called eternal son because a son had to have a beginning the father was before him right and he said so jesus had a beginning he said god had no beginning we're moving on he said see but the sun the next paragraph all right that's right so jesus had a beginning god had no beginnings see he said but the son was not that eternal sonship but the son that was with the father in the beginning was the the logos that went out of god not a son but an essence of his spirit that went out in the form of the logos it went out of god then he goes on the next paragraph 387 and it was the theophany of god that went out interesting the human form that didn't have eyes like you see a better eye didn't have ears like you here but a far more hearing see it was a theophany that all this rainbow that great rainbow condescended into a theophany which is a pre in this in this case it's referring to a pre-incarnate body for christ to dwell in or a body that contains deity he said moses saw it when it passed through the rock like that he saw the back parts he said it looked like a man so when god wanted to appear as a son he had to do it in a body that had been created he created a theophany body and he stepped into that body now when did that body appear well it appeared to the hebrew children didn't it it's likely that it appeared to daniel it appeared to abraham on the road that was almighty god in a condescended form living in a body that was not like a physical flesh body but a body similar to that in appearance but created for a pre-incarnate christ to dwell in i know that that can sound using words like that it can sound a little complicated but let's just boil it down god wanted to come down he hadn't been born a son yet you're following me so far so he just made a body he didn't want to come like fire this time he didn't want to come like cloud this time he wanted to come like a priest so he just created a theophany body stepped into that body and showed up on planet earth a son in the sense that he had come from god but because there had been no birth yet only a pre-incarnate son which means no eternal sonship at that moment he was not fully the son of god he was god in a condescended form but not nearly as far as he would come when he chose to dwell in a body of flesh thank you i think i can feel you with me for a moment and i appreciate that so much can i read to these saints the maniac of gadara paragraph 32 i know some of you allow us to bog down in these reading these things but there's no way that i could bring all this to you if i went through and took it all out and listed it as points there's no way i could bring it all to you like he did it wasn't my job it wasn't my calling it was his calling he was gathering together all the things that all the reformers missed he said they all missed a bunch he said they all missed a bunch and when that one comes he's going to gather together everything he said that's why the seals had to open up there were too many truths in there that the reformers had missed why did they miss them they were sealed to them they couldn't see them if they wanted to are you with me jesus christ was god manifested in flesh jehovah god his father overshadowed the virgin mary and formed in her a blood cell which made the son christ jesus how many of you can get that why is it important to know that you need to know who jesus is because you're going to have neighbors up the street that live like hell you're in me now and they're going to tell you they love jesus and you're going to be fooled if you're not careful into thinking that they have experienced the same thing you've experienced because they say i love jesus i love the lord i can hear it in that tone i love the lord when somebody says it like that it's usually defensive i love the lord the problem is they don't know who he is it's only by the unveiling of who he is by the spirit that you and i can even really know him you can't serve him with their own heart if you don't know him and you can't know him unless he's revealed to you by the spirit you can't study on him and read on him and learn about him and know him it's a work of the inner spirit it's a work of the holy spirit in you it's the spirit of adoption that brings you from being a child born to a son given see he lived as a man listen now and at the baptism he lived as a man until he was baptized by john and jordan and immediately not a week later immediately after his baptism john bear record that's john 1 john bear record seeing the holy ghost coming from heaven and descending in him whoo and going upon him the dove that descended on him was not as powerful as the one who descended in him he didn't just sit up on his head to tell the world who he was but he was filled with the fullness of god's holy ghost in the jordan river that day though we were a son though we were the word made flesh though we were all these other things yet he had to receive the same infilling and baptism of the holy ghost that you and i have to receive it's the beginning of the adoption process you don't even begin your adoption process until after you have received the baptism of the holy ghost this is when it begins well what is all this out here you're getting to know him you're getting to know him but when he comes down and identifies you as his that's when your trouble starts that's when your trouble starts that's when you make it to the devil's radar that's when he's after you with anything and everything and anybody he can use to try to hold you down and pull you back discourage you make you want to quit why because he knows that you are a child that has been born but you are about to be a son that is given he said it immediately after his baptism john bear records seeing the holy ghost coming from heaven and descending in him and going upon him that's wonderful and before that time john heard a voice in the wilderness are you with me that told him upon whom thou shall see the spirit descending and remaining that's the one that's the one whoa john got it that's the one that'll baptize with the holy ghost and fire the holy ghost may have descended upon many but this was the day that he was going to descend in one this is the one i baptize you indeed in water but there's one coming who's going to baptize you with the holy ghost and fire and jesus said when he was here on earth that i do nothing of myself it's not me it's my father and he dwelleth in me see now the bible said that god the father was in christ the son reconciling the world to himself see so he was more than a man he was a i want you to say that he was a i want you to say that he was a he was a i like that he was more than just a man he was a god man he was more than just god he was a god man he was more than just a man he was a god-man i want you to know that's powerful and now one more please jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever campbellsville kentucky paragraph 30. let me read this one to you and when jesus our carpenter's son physically i don't need you to brag on me i have to beg for amen sometime i'm not looking for your bragging i would just like for you to know these things don't fall in my lap i'm just being real real for a moment some people only relate to real these things don't fall in my lap even if i get an idea or an inspiration from somewhere or somebody else it's my responsibility to check these things with the word and to check them with the message of the hour come on now so many many many many many times you you may you may think i just opened up and and all these quotes are gathered together in subject and all this is just already forming all i have to do is just come and preach it verse no no sir no brother sister no no no no no i'm not asking for you you pay your tithe faithfully you take care of me and my family

following sunday i labor in the word every day of the week seven days of the week i'm not boasting i'm just telling you my life seven days of the week my wife is here you ask her you ask her if there's a saturday that goes by that i'm not at home laboring in the word just like i have over here and you ask her what i'm doing at seven o'clock every sunday morning i'm back at the dining room table laboring in the word again even though i have already made sure that i have enough and that i'm ready to give you what the lord has laid on my heart for the week i want to go over it one more time in case there's something else some inspiration because you know what i i mean i may be preparing for something god may be bringing somebody in here that's never been in here before we got to be ready to meet their need as well are you with me this if that sounded like i was being my own cheerleader maybe i was for just a moment but i'd like for you to understand where i'm coming from when you spend your whole life then and on top of that dealing with the pettiness of people it's a serious walk we're living here it's a serious responsibility hallelujah to sit in a service and watch folk act the way they act sometimes when the presence of god is moving in here one of these days brother sister i'm telling you one of these days you'll regret the moments you wasted when you could have entered into the presence of god had your needs met and your blesser blessed just a moment amen pastor it's just the truth it's just a truth let me give you something else and when jesus a carpenter's son physically speaking when he come to the earth here that's all he was known of and and the day when jesus excuse me and that day when john baptized him god vindicated him there it was an announcement god vindicated him god spoke from the heavens john saw him coming in the form of a dove and said this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell now i love the fact that brother branham an uneducated kentucky gentleman is correcting the translator powerful it's holy ghost inspired because all you have to do is do a quick check on this somebody said well he probably got that out of the diagonal or he probably got he may have but it took a lot of boldness for somebody with an elementary school education to correct the translation of the king james version of the bible powerful i love it i love it he said now uh the right translation there is and he's absolutely right he said the right translation is whom i am pleased to dwell in it's one thing to say i'm pleased with you i'm pleased with who you are it's another thing to say you're my son and i am so pleased in who you are and how you reflect me that today i'm coming and living in you [Applause] you talk about his life even even increasing in that moment you get the fullness of god coming to live inside i'm telling you what in that moment he was more god than man brother branham is telling us here before the baptism he was only a man i would say this is how i would say it i would say that he was more man than god but on this day when he became god man he was more god than man god was doing something all right he goes on in whom i'm pleased to dwell jesus immediately anointed with god he was just a man till that time but now what did he become he become the god man oh if somebody could see a head and recognize who you are as an adopted son of god going through your process just like jesus went through his just like brother william branham had to go through his you're going through yours so that at the end of this you and i who have lived our whole life as just men we graduate to something else god men somebody said oh i couldn't go that far you don't even have to know this message to know that john g lake who was a great man of faith powerfully used of god but not a believer or follower of this message he had a revelation way back when that that's exactly what would have to take place in the end time because men wouldn't be able to get the job done but god men would men filled filled with the fullness oh yes hallelujah praise the lord he said someone telling me here not long ago as i many times referred to it as this shiftless day that he was just a prophet he was a good man he was more than that he was the anointed god the bible said god was in christ reconciling the world to himself god in christ amen the balance he's just bringing the balance oh lord have mercy you really want me to explain why we needed a prophet we needed a balance we needed a balance we needed someone unbiased we needed someone not trained by the seminary who could hear thus saith the lord that's what we needed him for so many reasons he said notice it how beautiful the father speaking are you with me the father speaking from the heavens when he was obedient 109 to baptism said this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell in no wonder jesus could say all the power in heavens and earth is given unto my hand given that means he wasn't born with all the power that means he wasn't born a child with all the power it means he received all the power when he stepped in to the fullness of a manifested sun and there was a process between the jordan how many of you know there was a process between the jordan and the mount of transfiguration don't you tell me his was easier than yours i don't want to hear it his was tailor-made his was full of a lot of a lot of betrayals his church betrayed him i'm telling you if anybody knows what it means to go through something he did and then i have just one sentence there zoe um in in paragraph 3 41 just just maybe two sentences there from christ is the mystery of god revealed let's give this just so everybody can understand what this sonship is about it's not eternal sonship but it is a sonship that has a beginning and then it has a completion it has a place of full adoption you want to you want to do some homework go to the table or go to our app and find the adoption series and listen to those sermons that brother branham preached on the adoption and hear them all and get that in your spirit and understand that there is a process but one day there is a fullness he said the god himself saying this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell in and i'd like for you i don't mean to pressure you into working but i'd like for you to read that last sentence if you need some homework on that one hear the message oneness write that down oneness i'm not sure if there's more than one that title if there is i'll come back here on tuesday night and give you the year of the one i'm talking about all of them would be good but there is there is a truth that is revealed in the message of oneness that is so powerful for you and i to get a hold of in our own life because we who sometimes feel so far away from god need to understand that it has been modeled for us and a patterned sun has gone before us and god desires to do in your life of course you're not going to be the messiah of course you're not going to be the messiah the savior you've had a messiah you've had a savior but guess what you will be manifested sons of god fully adopted sons of god messiahs god then god women we got to have it we got to have it we'll never get out of here we'll never be able to get out of here now let me give you a little more i'm going to take a little more 112. i i i think you're i think you're moving along with me now a little bit mark chapter 1 verses 10 and 11. it looks so easy sometimes from where you're sitting you know why anybody would just yearn for a place like this a position of having to feed people it's only it's only what god does it's his grace it's his mercy or we would we just couldn't do it none of us could do what we are called to do you couldn't do what you're called to do mark chapter 1 verses 10 11 if if the pull of faith could be here we wouldn't have to worry about those who could never amen we wouldn't have to worry about those who sleep if there was enough people pulling in faith when the word is going forth we could just move on past all of them somebody said well what about the anointing i don't operate the anointing have you heard the message i don't operate the anointing no more than brother branham operated the gift you operate the anointing you pull the atmosphere in by your faith i just yield and and and god knows i need it i need his anointing that's why i pray and ask the lord just like you would ask the lord to anoint you i ask him for his anointing but i'm not building an atmosphere here i'm helping you we're building an atmosphere in the spirit when we come together here we just can't let anything when we once we get in here we can't let anything divide us we can fight like branham's in the backyard but when we get in here it's in our house we have no right bringing our stuff in here no no no not at all not at all not at all we don't we got to come around we got to come around when we're in the backyard we fight like branhams when we come around to the front we're one one brotherhood we're one body when we come into the house of god we're one we come to get the same thing to receive from him his spirit what he has for us you'd be surprised how effective you can be right at your seat by pulling in faith by refusing to roll your eyes around in your head don't do that don't do that get ahold of yourself somebody said i don't believe anybody would you like for us to photograph it show you how we react sometime i'm afraid that the camera may not catch it but i'm not afraid of the camera i'm more concerned about the all-seeing eye if it's the word of a man you might treat it however you would like but if it's god's word i think we should be a little more careful how we entertain it meet me included remember i grew up in an hour where you didn't put the song book on top of the bible when you laid your bible on the pew there we were just honoring a written record of god's word how much more should we honor the word when it comes forward oh yes i just can't imagine brother branham sitting on those platforms he had to hear a lot of stuff that he knew was not right when he would go and preach among the full gospel businessmen's fellowship and all these other speakers but i just can't imagine brother branham sitting there walling his eyes rolling him around in his head putting on his chapstick while the presence of god is moving in the service i can't imagine that kind of disrespect in fact one of my favorite clips of brother branham is on a night when he wasn't even preaching i believe it was jack cole but i might be wrong someone resent it to me not too long ago i believe it was jack cole was preaching um john hall if he happened to hear this he could correct me because i think he's the one that sent this to me but i think his brother jack courts are preaching away and brother branham is sitting there right on the front somewhere i don't remember if he's right on the platform or not but he's sitting there and his hands are lifted up like that and there's a glow it looks like there's tears running down his face and there's a glow on him i want you to know jack cole was preaching no i don't know what he was preaching in that moment but jack cole was a part of a trinitarian denomination brother branham must have had to hear a lot of things that he didn't like that he didn't agree with but i just cannot imagine him disrespecting a.a allen or jack cole or any of those other brothers when the word was going for he did like i do like you do going down the road in the radio preacher how many times did i listen to some of you brag about a preacher on the radio bragging bragging brag and bragging bragging now the whole kingdom fallen a whole string of sexual exploits that have destroyed his family and have toppled the ministry that he built they're still struggling to see how they'll be able to put it all together and go on that wasn't you missing something you were not amen in his life you didn't know his life nor did i there was something he brought he was one of the greatest apologists of all times there was something in what he said that resonated with you as the truth and you were amending that truth you were taking sides with the word not a man you don't have to be ashamed of that that was between him and his creator you just knew when the word was coming come on now don't you hear the word do you not hear it do you not hear it this morning can you not recognize it to be the word of god then i need a lot of prayers i got to find the word if this ain't it i got to find it mark chapter 1. did we read mark already no verse 10 and 11. here it is again we did matthew now here's mark and straightway coming up out of the water he saw the heavens open and the spirit like a dove descending upon him and there came a voice from heaven saying thou art my beloved son in whom i am well pleased what brother branham say the right translation i'm pleased to dwell now look at mark 9 that was the beginning that was the baptism that was the beginning of that option mark 9 talks about the ending and there was a cloud that overshadowed them and a voice came out of the cloud saying this is my beloved son that's right hear him hear him he's passed every test he has graduated every quiz he has proven the thesis he is who he is who i made him to be now here what he has to say because he's going to say some things that are going to upset your religion this is the father warning them you you're going from here on out you're going to hear some things they're going to shake your theology up a bit come on and he did look at some of the things that came out of his mouth after his baptism look at some things that came out of his mouth in that short period of time now well anyway i can't get to that we would see jesus 10 more minutes please we would see jesus santa maria california my brother branham could do some good preaching in california i don't know if they'd have him today do you paragraph 37 he said we we know now he was born of a virgin at the age of 30 years old he was baptized by john the baptizer went into the wilderness and if that is the truth he didn't have much long not much longer after his baptism things began to roll rather quickly didn't he he said at the age of 30 years old he was baptized by john the baptizer went into the wilderness and was tempted of the devil this is what i was going to say a moment ago for 40 days and nights how would you like to come out of the baptism with a voice over your head saying this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell and immediately be driven by the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted 40 days and 40 nights of the devil there's a price to pay to be an adopted son he had to pay it you have to pay it i have to pay it it's just the truth isn't it all right we're hurrying he said the first thing we notice after he come out well john saw a sign over him like a light a form of a dove came down from heaven and a voice coming from the form of a dove the spirit of god a voice coming from the spirit of god which the dove was the spirit of god saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased he said now that's the king james version now the original version is something the same thing my i do hope all you precious message people who will hear this hear brother branham correcting the king james version of the bible he called it the most perfect nonetheless but all of you who have such a problem with the amplified or with any other version than the king james i'm so thankful that brother branham struck the balance he had the balance here he saw that even in that it could be sometimes explained a little clearer using the original word he said now the original version is something same thing it says in whom i'm pleased to dwell in and god dwelt in christ we know that he said it's not me that doeth the works it's my father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works saint john 5 19 is that's five so far i can't see it let me look down here 5 19. did anybody notice the front screen's brighter that's a 300 light bulb mine's not working too good right now but i noticed as soon as i came out here can you put something up help me please zoe don't leave me hanging see see how nice and bright that is our old light bulb gave up the ghost we were hunting it we knew we had one more may just be my eyes but i got a feeling that one in the back is is is getting dimmer too all right john 5 19 he said verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing that doeth the son likewise i'm telling you when he started saying things like this that's when people started struggling he started really laying it on the line once he stepped into that adoption once he stepped into the fullness of the holy ghost give me the paradox if you will 64. bakersfield california i have just a few more to get done before tuesday night i might as well just lay it all out there now summer happy summer pouting some are full of joy some are full of something i don't know we might as well just move on paragraph 37 we know now he was born of the virgin didn't i just read that one maybe we need to hear it again paragraph 201 when jesus was standing there and upon the shores of galilee john looked up and he saw the spirit of god like a dove descending and a voice saying this is my beloved son in whom i am pleased to dwell in brother branham he just is quoting it right there and then he goes on in whom i am pleased to dwell the same thing verb before the adverb is all see this is my beloved son in whom i am pleased to dwell in god and man becoming one uniting together for what redemption how god that covered all space and time could come down and bottle himself into a man so he could taste death for all the human race i want you to look at this next sentence the creator dying to save his creation that doesn't touch you the greatest love story of all times the creator dying to save his creation isn't that a powerful truth we're blessed oh we're blessed heaven and earth listen he goes on heavens and earth kissed each other man and god became one he said how can a man there that he might dwell in man in fellowship it's nothing but god descending trying to get to his man did you know that's what he's doing today he's trying to get to his man he's trying to get to his woman give me mark you don't have the scripture give me mark chapter 1 verse 12 and 13. i'm nearly finished in every way immediately i'm gonna go ahead and read because i know it'll take a while now i just wanted to say it is never the fault of these ladies it's a computer issue with the software that's not quite able to handle but we're getting it remedied hopefully very very soon we're working on a fix because it makes them feel terrible for a scripture to be called and then it takes so long to pull up they're literally waiting for it they're waiting for it so that you can see it but it we have a great software we just have to have some great hardware hardware that works with that great software but we're nearly there it's almost in place so please you you should always nod at these sisters when you get a chance and thank them for the work they do and nathan two at times in charity at times too but zoe and abigail they really carry it and nod adam and tell them what a good job they do and tell them you know it's not their fault now if it continues to happen with the new hardware and the new software it's on you maybe not and immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness and he was there in the wilderness 40 days tempted of satan and was with the wild beasts and the angels don't ever forget this mark tells it a little different and the angels ministered unto him he was identified by god as a son even in his darkest temptation in the darkest testing the long dark night of the soul the angels of god came and ministered to him did he see them he probably did but do you have to see them to receive their ministry no no no no oh how they come to minister to us to sukhoroz when we're in trouble and i'm going to share two quotations for this verb this this scripture and we're going to stop expectations jonesboro arkansas when jesus was here he was god was in christ reconciling the world to himself this you got to hear this but he never used any of his gifts this is powerful i come to this this morning i had this in another message i was working on i had to grab it for this one this was a change that came this morning i couldn't help it i don't know who this is for but i hope you'll take this it sister beth it bless my blesser sitting at my kitchen table about the only place i can see it don't have a couch it's in the attic all the chairs are in the attic and the when i say attic thank god not the one up but the one the insurance company put in the front yard don't feel sorry for me i'm doing enough of that for myself i'm just saying my goodness i'd like a chair to sit in we we can go in the den oh yes you can go in the den if you can stand the clothes and pile to the ceiling and all the other stuff that's in there sure i thought about coming to your house yesterday he said when jesus was here he was god god was in christ reconciling the world to himself but he never used any of his gifts when he met satan he brought the kingdom of god so low oh till the weakest of christian you hear me oh i'm not going to try to hide what this means to me he brought the kingdom of god so low till the weakest of christians can use it when satan come to him and said if thou be the son of god command these stones he said it is written notice notice he didn't say shut your mouth i'm your creator don't you know who i am i made every rock i made every volcano i made every ocean no do you believe he had power to slay the enemy do you believe he had power to smite the enemy do you believe he had miraculous supernatural power that worked above and beyond the laws of nature you believe he could have turned the devil into a bullfrog and sent him on his way he had all power and yet when satan met him he chose not to use any of the giftings not his office not his giftings not his callings he didn't have to he brought the kingdom so low see you can't you can't use your messiah ship you can't use all that either we we don't we may not be able to reach up and get on into that and and uh you know turn the devil into a snake on the ground or or whatever else you don't have to jesus was our patterned son and our example and he went before us and here's how he whipped the devil it is written the word he took him up he tried to whitewash the word for him and jesus said and it is also written he took him up to the top of the mountain said he had to look all these kingdoms i will give them to you if you worship me and what jesus do he said it is written there it is the weakest christian the weakest christian in this room has everything they need right now right now not next sunday not at camp meeting not after the next revival but right now not when you feel good not when you feel the victory not when you feel like shouting not when you have no egg no pain no no infirmity right now the kingdom has been brought so low that all we have to do is take up what jesus took up take up the word it is written there it is and the last i mean the last musicians are coming this is the last show us the father and it suffices 1950 cleveland paragraph 43 jesus had all the fine qualities of god in him do you believe it are you hearing me do you believe it he had powers upon powers but when he met satan look look at this he never used his power he could have he could have said do you realize that just a few days ago in the jordan river god almighty came down over my head like a dove and spoke from heaven and said i'm i'm the beloved son and and uh he's dwelling in me how dare you come and bother me this way he could have used a lot of powers he could have made a lot of quotes he could have said a lot of things he could have used a lot of giftings he said he gave an example listen listen this is for you he gave an example for the weakest of christians don't raise your hand but are there any weak christians here we get that way when he met satan what'd he do he said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth or proceeds out of the mouth of god the weakest christian can take that stand hold it hold it sure god's in his word now wait just a minute wait just a minute if god is in his word how valuable how worthy is his word how we treat the word it's how we treat god god is in his word oh yes that's not twisting that's taking the prophet for what he's saying to us he said every time when he would meet the enemy he said it is written he said i believe he had power to do it but he met satan on the same grounds whoa with the same word that you can meet him with he met satan with the same on the same grounds with the same word that you can meet him with everyone it's written it's written it is written it is written when you are weak and you can't pray in tongues when you are weak and you feel no power your giftings seem to escape you you still don't have to go down in defeat you still don't have to agree with depression you still don't have to agree with whatever it is that the enemy is using against you you have the same authority and the same weapon to stand on the same grounds and use the same word that jesus used against the enemy it is written would you stand lord i want to thank you for your word today i want to thank you that it's life hallelujah i want to thank you lord that you have given it to us in a way that we can understand it it may not seem as supernatural as a power or as a gifting but there is nothing more supernatural than taking up your word and using it to slay the enemy to pull the giant down f-a-i-t-h j-e-s-u-s we thank you today that you have gone before us our lord and shown us the way that we might also grow in grace from glory to glory strength to strength faith to faith that we might also grow in stature grow in wisdom those sons from before the foundation of the world we were first born as children even as you were our lord and then you became a given son one who had passed the test one who was celebrated by the declaration here he him and all heaven and earth had to listen to the authority with which he spoke the word your prophet told us that in the last days the voice of the resurrection would be in the bride she would echo the bridegroom's voice and in order for that to happen she will first have to be able to differentiate and distinguish between her voice and his by our own inner voices based on souls and emotion and your voice that's based on nothing but the word lord i want to thank you that you have made provision for the weakest christian causes hell to tremble when he or she gets down on their knees if the weakest christian can cause such a disturbance in hell oh god what can it do when mighty men and women of valor are raised up in your authority pulling out of weakness and into your strength oh my then we have to do as brother robert was praying then we start speaking the word of god into the atmosphere that changes things oh my god hallelujah i saw it i saw authority exercised even this week someone prayed a humble prayer and oh god you cared enough about that prayer to begin to make it happen just as it was prayed that's

victory today she needs a miracle today and she's come to the lord knowing that he is more than able and it was her desire to be prayed for today and we're going to do it with all the faith we can muster but we know that it's not a matter about getting our faith high enough it's a matter of just taking god at his word we're doing that we're just going to take him at his word today wherever you are in this room would you reach your hand of faith this way would you would you be with us would you be with us now not be talking or doing anything else would you spend just a moment in dedicated prayer and attention for our sister right now [Music] let your hand just be an extension of your faith just put it toward her god sees your faith he sees your faith right where you are right where you're standing there may be somebody streaming this service that's putting their faith in here for sister evelyn may not even know her lord i pray that the very same faith that they are stretching toward you on her behalf would return back to them and that they would see a miracle that they would see the meeting of their need lord i believe there's power when you have a need in praying for somebody else and using your faith on their behalf lord we anoint our sister in the mighty name of the lord jesus christ we stand here without one little ounce of doubt in who you are and what your ability is to heal to save to deliver to work miracles you are the same god who healed on the shore of galilee you're the same god that healed in the healing revival of the 50s and 60s you are jehovah rapha of the old testament the healing virtue is the same today as it flowed out of your body when the little woman touched you and the hem of your garment with her faith right now lord we stand believing confessing declaring your word of healing over this body father we know what her confession is we know what her faith says today and lord we're asking you for a turn around ha ha we're asking you lord to turn this thing around for your glory father i believe you would have her to be able to move without such awful pain lord have mercy would you tell me again what your surgery is and is it not related to this pain this is something else uh now and it's every night every night and when and when is your surgery scheduled all right would you just uh we're going to pray again she's uh has been scheduled for some time it's been changed a bit for a knee replacement but what is really going on is something in the respiratory like a choking and a heaviness or something that that affects your night and also in the daytime at times and has been since june now we know that the lord is able to go right into those lungs he is able i know he's able you believe it folks do you believe it church not that we had to know the detail but i just wanted to get it because i thought i was missing something now would you just reach your faith this way one more time and let's ask the lord to go right down into those lungs lord you're not only a repairer you're not only a healer but you're still a creator you didn't stop creating when you created the earth there is still creation power in your word and so lord it wouldn't take any extra effort to create and recreate with a creative miracle in those damaged lungs whatever it is that the enemy has desired to settle in i don't know what it is but it's as though he's come to settle there till the end but we just stand against it as a body of believers we stand against the assignment to heavy her lungs to affect her breathing we stand against the assignment to take her life it's like i could hear a spirit saying that he would just go there and stay but we cancel that in the authority of jesus christ we command you to take your hands off we know that the name of jesus and the blood of jesus and the word of almighty god are the weapons that we have been given to drive you out and to cancel your assignments [Music] we call for new tissue we call for new cells and new tissue to be formed in those lungs for the glory of god just go right ahead holy ghost and seal in what her faith is accomplishing right now oh [Music] oh the devil's a liar and the father of all lies he has no power and no authority to cut short our destiny days we expose him see what he does is he tries to wear us down until we give in to his lies throwing ourselves into the permissive will of god instead of into the perfect will of god because we agree with what he has to say we just say lord right now let such a faith arise let such a faith arise and sister evelyn today that there is no part of her that agrees with what the enemy has tried to speak over her life and over her body ishmael in fact i just want to take authority over some things that uh that doctors have spoken i see those in in in some authority at least authority you've given to them to speak i i want to believe god right now to cancel some of that because even some of that has you on a collision course and we just take that off in the name of jesus we're not talking about those who serve sin we're not talking about those who run down their life serving sin we're talking about the sons of god we're talking about the children of the most high god and we don't have to live by that same standard of degeneration we take you at your word lord i believe that everyone who would try to help would do all that they know to do and say all that they know to say but when it is contrary to god's truth we stand on the side of the word and we just say right now let every bit of that influence and the effect that it has had on the cells of this body be canceled in the name of jesus so that the healing virtue can now go into every one of those systems and cells and bring resurrection life would you praise the lord in here with me somebody how we should believe god anytime he helps us anytime he's willing to help us we ought to praise him when he helps somebody we love we ought to pray hallelujah and be held [Music] deep breaths [Music] there's something let me say this to you before you say something to me there's something at the top of your stomach i'm not sure exactly what it is but i think i can say that it's at the top of your stomach that's affecting you in some way i don't know exactly what that is because i know that a lot of the digestion takes place below the stomach but i saw something like a sore ulcer or something something look very very aggravated or something and i don't know what that has to do with anything you're going may not even be related to what what you've told me but i saw it just as clear as a bell so let's ask the lord to bring healing to that as well father i wished i knew exactly what to call it but what would it matter you know lord i see it i saw it just as clear as as i could see something that and i know you know what it is white and looked what i would say like around i around that two but it's below the esophagus lower than that lord you're the healer i don't know why you choose to show something like that but i just asked you to break would you sister just run your hand up and down right right like this just both either of you both of you just lord i ask you to do it lord i ask you to heal i praise you in fact i glorify you for healing right now i glorify you for healing hallelujah and lord everything anything else that's in her heart right now for even for others i ask you to get under this lord we just come against worry we just come again i know it's human i know we're human i know we're human but lord these things move us out of a promise i just ask for such strength and faith to be upon her lord there's a such loneliness that goes with with her where she's called to be and i just ask you right now to minister like that elder brother i i'm asking your lord to minister just like that one that could just come put your arm around her oh god in the name of jesus to protect lord i thank you that you are her protector i thank you that you are her shelter hallelujah glory glory glory glory glory glory glory be to god what were you going to say oh [Music] oh i don't know how hallelujah i don't even remember right this thing oh yes yes yes yes oh yeah yes yes yes oh i'm so glad i am so glad god bless you uh have they come back to say that's not the case with their heart or they still [Music] um [Music] yeah that's what i was feeling but it's over we're going to believe god that that assignment is canceled and we're waiting on the full manifestation of the miracle but i believe it hallelujah god bless you someone else come for prayer or you all just come to help pray thank you for doing that hallelujah any good i know you're ready to go we're ready for you to go there's something i appreciate about faith faith can pull you know faith is it it's not a it's not something abstract it's real i mean you can't touch faith but faith can accomplish so much now i've known sister evelyn for 30 years or more and there's something about her faith that activates the gift every time it's coming with the determination not to hear something but to have something how can you not how can you not stir up what's present when you come with that kind of an expectation it's mine and she said as she was standing here what's really stirred her heart in this service was that line the creator died for his creation yes sir do you know an inventor who would die for what they invented only our creator would die for his creation isn't he wonderful and worthy amen let's stand together be dismissed thank you for all every one of you that put your faith in here even those of you who are at your seat and those of you who were there would you continue to remember sister davies in south africa that god would give her deliverance from her awful headaches and for our brother in pakistan whose little daughter cherith rose would see her victory whatever is going on she was such a beautiful little girl but she looks so sick and how that reaches to your heart and he is serving the lord in pakistan with a church and i know that god is able to move would you remember the family of of sister tebow's niece crystal who was i don't know miraculously spared at at some point to be able to come home and even communicate with her family for a short period of time so many didn't have that opportunity with their loved ones who went that way but after being how long in in on the ventilator how long was she almost two months and was able to get strong enough to come home and then the depression would settle on her of not being able to have the same quality of life and just when they were beginning to see some improvement there and getting her beyond that she suffered all i'm sure all related to what was going on in her body two strokes and the strokes left her so brain damaged that when the artificial assistance was was turned off there was no life left and deborah his sister tebow's sister who was living with her there for a while and came several times to service and she's lost a daughter 40 how old 43 years old and a husband who's older and not in good health and children and grandchildren who some have been here we want to continue to remember that family when is there a service for her a service tuesday for her in in florida i guess it is would you all help us pray for her family that god will continue to help them and strengthen them and minister to them and and would you pray especially for pam uh billy's sister brother billy's sister they were very close especially as younger ones weren't they very very close and she's having a hard time would you help me as we close now also to lift up pam to the
