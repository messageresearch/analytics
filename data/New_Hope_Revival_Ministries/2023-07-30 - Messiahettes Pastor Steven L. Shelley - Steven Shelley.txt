worthy Worthy is the Lord [Applause] Worthy is the Lord [Applause] Worthy is the Lord worthy Worthy Worthy is the Lord holy is he hallelujah we're pointing to him he is the one that is Holy he is the one that is worthy you may be seated this morning I know you've been standing a lot in his Chad said you've been up and down I hope that's not spiritually I hope it's just physically up and down and that's just part of being in a Pentecostal meeting I know that some Churches sing the whole congregational set sitting down and I I just uh you know I'm not Catholic and I'm not Baptist Methodist or any of those others and uh I've never I've never felt like one could enter in quite as good and uh I think that it really really helps when we put everything that we've got we we write out a prescription and we say Lord this is what I have need of today and I want you to meet me in my praise I want you to meet me in my worship I want you to meet me through your word and then I want you to come and say Amen and he will do that if you believe it say Amen let me have your undivided attention for a little while today uh there are just so many many things going on all at one time and we must be spiritually Vigilant and alert and maybe you saw the post that we made I won't take time this morning although I would really love to talk about it a little bit at depth but uh since 2019 uh especially around this time around uh tishbe of the ninth of off the day that we mourn the loss of the temple somebody said why would a Christian even remember such a thing as that because Jesus pointed us to that Earthly Temple as our example of what his body would accomplish as our spiritual Temple and we've heard in the message of the hour what house will you build me and so since 2019 at Tish bayaf uh sort of unusually in in 2019 I think there were three and in 2023 there was only one a fox that appeared on the Temple mount now if you have been there which fulfilled not only scripture but it fulfilled Jewish oral law and uh it was quite interesting because the Bible talks about foxes uh one translation says hopping among the ruins if you saw the picture that I posted of the single Fox he is literally sitting on the ruins there there are are is there any way charity that you could bring that picture up it's incredible when you think about it I've been to the Temple mount oh I don't know 75 times 80 times 100 times not always up on top but in the quotel The Wailing Wall the Western Wall I've never seen a fox in the city of Jerusalem and uh lamentation speaks about it there's another prophecy one of the other prophets of the Old Testament talks about it uh that that foxes will go in and out and around the ruins of of the temple and that in it's written in the mishnah in talmudic times it's written that just leave that up there a minute how many of you can see that and I was able to verify through a friend living in Jerusalem that that photograph was taken on tishbe the ninth of off and there's a video I posted also a video of the fox running through running through the temple Mound and down uh out through the temp through the through the cartel Courtyard but anyway uh where was I this particular picture is so interesting because those rocks that they are sitting on this is this is in this is at what we call the ophel and in the Bible Mount oh fail it is an area I believe it's also referred to now as the Davidson archaeological uh complex and it if if the Western Wall is here just say this is the Western Wall which is the retaining wall of the Temple mount the temple sat up on top this has now become the Wailing Wall or the Western Wall and then you would turn the corner and the old fell is here the city of David is there the pool of Siloam is there down at the bottom of the hill there are steps ancient Steps From the second temple from the time of Jesus that are coming up this southern end of the Temple mount and in front are ruins of mikvahs the the holy uh ritual baths that the Jews had to bathed themselves in before they could go up and worship at the temple now when Titus besieges the city of Jerusalem they literally shoved the stones of the temple and the and the upper compound off the retaining wall and they have sat there for two thousand years so those stones that you see see how some of them are shaped I don't hear nobody answering me some of them look like just Stone just rocks but some of them look very shape so those stones have sat there for 2 000 years and the scripture talks about foxes playing on the on the ruins of the temple and there they are and there is a writing I know where I was now there's a writing in the mishnah in the talmudic from talmudic times that speaks specifically about foxes reappearing on the ruins of the temple just prior to the rebuilding of the Third Temple and so both Jews and Gentiles have have passed this uh picture and the video all over the world and the Jews are excited about it because they believe that it is signaling the the rebuilding of the temple and Believers are excited about it because anything that brings us closer to that brings us closer to Resurrection rapture and so we get excited about it too so things are moving in an unusual way and we feel them in the natural we feel the kickback uh sister Anna Christine has put a real could we play it could you find the Reel that has over 21 000 views this week if you go to our Facebook uh I I'd like for everybody to see it we have we've never had so much response some of it most of it positive I guess most maybe I'm not sure if we've passed that because she's deleting and I'm deleting ugliness and uh she even you know reached out yesterday and said you know uh Pastor if if I if this is bringing too much attention that we don't want then you know we can just we can do away with it but no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no I'm not ashamed there's nothing in that clip or any other clip up there that I'm ashamed of and if 21 000 people have viewed it I'm a happy man I hope 51 000. I hope I hope 151 000 people I I hope a million view it because sometimes all it takes is one little tiny seed to cause somebody to dig I remember how God brought sister Nancy in Jerusalem to the message of truth I presented one message and she she sent for me she said bring bring him back over here I want to meet him in the garden I want to ask some questions after one message and she served me tea and the brothers were there waiting on me she served me tea and she said now tell me the whole story she said you were just dropping little nuggets out but I'm smart enough to know you've got something behind everything you said and that brought her here to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ play this real quick I hope you're still alert stay alert with me would you the church world has it so wrong because they're so upset with how God has been presented that they are presenting a God that's not even the god of the Bible when you hear people say God don't care how you dress and God don't care how you live and God don't care how you're baptized I want you to know that is a false god that's not the god of the Bible the god of the Bible is very specific about how you conduct yourself how you live your life you see this is where the church that's all it was that's always sin and you'd be surprised you would be surprised as some of the comments that people make who made you the boss what who gives you Authority what do you what do you know well not much I've only been studying the Bible 50 years but I still don't know it all uh so this this is a good thing because it's causing people well I'll just tell you we went up a hundred followers in two days on Facebook what that means is when we live our services like right now they'll see it it'll come up in their feed they will know and so I can see the potential of God reaching his seed I'm excited about having a part of that but it brings a lot of backlash to me personally to my family into this body of Christ spiritually it stirs up things in that other realm so would you pray a little more and spend a little more time praying for us and praying against that backlash I was asking a question because it it uh sometimes manifests itself physically and sometimes it can be emotionally sometimes it can be spiritually and uh we've learned that I don't know why it seems like we're we're forgetting it but we've learned that through the years and it can actually affect all of you so we have to be prayed up there's a prayer covering that must be lifted up over this house and this ministry and the leadership so that the enemy when he comes against it he'll just bounce back and uh you know some have sent videos around this week uh questioning brother Branham and they've sent this and and trying to wear on some of the young people and just different things going on and we just have to pray because in the end I heard him sing this morning the lion of the tribe of Judah prevails truth wins truth wins and we want to stay on the word and we want to stay on the truth amen so uh as Chad mentioned this has been an amazing week because we announced last week that the Lord had give had provided one hundred thousand dollars toward the uh principle of the of the building and it took a little while you know you you'd be surprised all the approvals you have to get when you're writing a check for that amount first of all I had to speak it probably took me seven or eight minutes sister Flo to write the check because I had to make sure I could get it right the sex and when I had to put it in them little boxes I had to count the spaces because we the payment was one hundred thousand and seventy five dollars now that'll throw you off one zero zero zero seventy five point zero zero and I'm not used to writing anything above ten dollars and so I had to count the boxes and and and you never you would never believe the approval processes as we went along that day uh no no teller can can approve you you can't even deposit that kind of money without approval you know makes you want to tell them listen if anybody ever comes along here and wants to put a hundred thousand dollars in my account will you please let them do it no you have to have a cashier's check and when you go to buy the cashier's check it has to be approved and and the the girl said to the to the teller beside her she said can you approve oh no she said I can't approve anything over seventy thousand so we have to get the bank manager out to approve and then to deposit and to approve it on and on and on and I don't care none of it bothered me I didn't let anything bother me I smiled the whole day at the goodness of God [Applause] I feel necessary to tell you one more time when you would wonder where it came from it came from him that's where it came from so you can quit asking me and you can quit asking my family because that's where it came from amen so just let me remind you I don't discuss your giving I don't go around telling people that there are some of you that have been here for years and never paid made a tie check I don't go around telling people what you give or don't give foreign and so and as I said we have people from all over the world it may not be huge amounts always but we have people all over the world who give there's a couple in England who send offerings almost weekly and and we're just blessed because we have so many friends and so many loved ones and God did it I had one brother to text me and he said all I know is I prayed specifically and I said Lord would you find someone and speak to their heart who could give one hundred thousand dollars [Applause] isn't he good he is so good I don't think I have the original balance wrote down here but it was uh it was close to a half a million dollars and can I tell you what the new balance is 42 000. 626.67 let's give God praise Hallelujah praise the Lord it's official [Applause] it wasn't official last week because we hadn't made the payment yet we did that on Friday and usually it takes a couple days for them to update the site but by the end of the day it was already updated so I was I was checking every few hours just like a little kid you don't know anybody else like that do you amen so Tuesday of this week is Sister Joyce Greeley's birthday so when she sees this service she will know that we love her and we wish her a happy birthday on Wednesday of this week August the 2nd is brother Shane minko's birthday God bless you brother happy birthday to you you share a birthday with our with our brother Benny West who has gone to be with the Lord and uh so I like that it made me feel good when I when I wrote down that brother Shane's birthday was on August the 2nd because I remembered it being brother West's birthday and and two days later on Friday would would be brother Billy's mom sister Rose Tebow's birthday and I don't believe you celebrate birthdays in heaven but I believe it's a wonderful day to remember and think about our loved ones who have gone and Saturday is Mary Beth's birthday this coming Saturday and she and Hawk and the children are living their best life in Iceland some of you have asked us about our Iceland trip and we have temporarily postponed it we are waiting for for uh passport to come back and we we could have fought and got it there was a way they told us a way that we could have kind of pushed the issue but we have uh chosen not to do that because sometimes you know you try to make things work with somebody else's schedule and you might miss what God really has for you so we don't have tickets yet but a couple of weeks after our after our scheduled return we will probably go so sometime uh in in the next month we will probably uh start making a trip to to Iceland we feel that God is calling us and that there is a purpose in it but we don't look folks it's too late in the hour to be anywhere I mean I'm invited to many many places but I have to be where God would want me to be it's too late I'm 55 years old really I know that's not not ancient but you think about how many years you have left if the Rapture should not should tarry a while longer and you you realize you don't have any more time to waste being out of God's perfect and divine will so please pray for us that we will I want to say thank you to all of you who worked so hard didn't it look beautiful out there thank you Nathan for organizing it thank you every brother every person who did what you did to make it look as beautiful as it looks right now there will be more work now putting the tables back and the chairs back and all the things to get ready for our service next Saturday night at six o'clock it is our fellowship weekend we we uh are believing that God will move and that he will have his wonderful way and our services we don't know all the folks who are coming but we've been having a great turnout if something happens that our turnout is a little less I'm not going to believe that it will be but should it be we have to keep in mind that camp meeting is coming up in October and people are asking off already to be able to come in October we have invited brother Isaiah Brooks to come we haven't had a final confirmation from him yet but he has expressed that it is his desire to come so he will be sharing the services with us this year and we're looking forward to whatever God has for us let's thank God for these musicians all that they have done thank you all so much I took my singing time so we'll have you to go down didn't Chad do a great job leading the service this morning [Applause] let's stand and go to the word will you help me I'm going to need it I just feel it I'm going to need it I'm going to need it I'm really going to need your help and I hope you won't let me down uh I have argued with the Lord a little bit I prayed I've tried to get out of this this morning and put it off because of some of the different things that have come up and happened during the week I've tried to to get off of this subject for now but the Lord just won't let me so um I want to explain a few things to you and preach the best that I can what the lord has laid on my heart and I'll start by reading Psalms 2 the second Psalm and nine verses and then I'm going to go to Romans 8 and you don't have that verse because the Lord brought brought it to my heart to read it after I was already on the platform but I'm next going to read Romans 8. 15 through 23 Romans 8 15-23 this is Psalms 2 and verse 1. why do the Heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing the kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord do you believe we're kind of living in a day like that and against his anointed now that word anointed there is is mache or mashiach or mashiach and he is specifically referring to the coming anointed one Yeshua the Lord Jesus Christ so we will read it as Messiah but in English the translators have interpreted in most places all but one I think they have translated as Anointed The Kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord and that Lord there would be Adonai and against his mashiach or Messiah saying let us break their bands asunder and Cast Away their cords from us he that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh the Lord shall have them in derision that is a serious prophetic word it speaks of not only the first coming of the Messiah but the days preceding the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ he that sitteth in the heaven shall laugh the Lord shall have them in derision then shall he speak unto them in his wrath and vix them in his sore displeasure yet have I set my king upon my Holy Hill of Zion who do you believe that King is Malik haholam the king of the universe the King of Kings and the Lord of lords the king not a king the king the sword of the king Our God I will declare the decree the Lord has said unto me thou art my my son this day have I begotten thee this is speaking to us of the eternal spirit of the father moving into a body of Flesh John 1 1 Same Spirit there are two Spirits there's only one spirit and so this was that eternal spirit of the father moving into a prophecy talking about an hour that the spirit of the Lord would move into a son Thou Art my son this day have I begotten thee ask of me and I shall give Thee the Heathen for thine inheritance and the other most parts of the Earth for thy possession I want you to know the Nations belong to the anointed the Bible tells us the Nations belong to the anointed we understand that the Nations belong to the anointed the anointed you're anointed aren't you ask ask of me and I will give Thee the Heathen for thine inheritance and the other most parts of the Earth for thy possession thou shall break them with a rod of iron Thou shalt Dash them in pieces like a Potter's vessel the Bible is prophesying to us about a time when the anointed of the Lord shall execute the righteous indignation and Judgment of our God upon the nations of the earth and Kings will bow and governments will collapse and Jesus Yeshua king of kings and Lord of lords will reign over the Earth for a thousand years of great Millennial peace and then in the new Heaven and the new Earth as our Messiah and our King Hallelujah we will sit at his feet in the Millennium and learn of him we will worship him in the restored Temple oh he is the temple we will worship him in the restored Temple because God has made a covenant with the city of Jerusalem and the land of Israel and God has said you will eternally be mine he has established the Throne of David which is a Messianic throne and a prophetic Throne he has established it forever in Jerusalem so you that have never visited Jerusalem I hope you get an opportunity to do that over here but if you don't you will worship God in the Millennium in that Holy place Jew and Gentile together no more no more segregation the Apostle Paul received the Revelation one new man both Jew and Gentile worshiping God together Lord we need you today I need you Lord I'm not here just to preach I'm here Lord to speak what you would lay on my heart and what you would speak through me I asked you today to arrest the hearts of men and women in this house arrest the hearts of those watching this service today May something be said that that would really get us really capture us for the purposes of the Kingdom Hallelujah we are not looking at the church we are looking to the kingdom and the king of all Kings leads the way help us today we pray Yeshua hamashiach in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the saint said you may be seated Romans chapter 8. beginning in verse 14 I don't know what I told you did I tell you 15 give me 14 if you will please for as many I'll just read it and you can put 15 up if you need to for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are come on Church they are the sons of God have you ever been led by the spirit of God let me see your hand let's make this very interactive this morning and we got to go somewhere we're going to fight to get there so you might as well make the fight a little easier all right I'm not trying to whip you I'm not I'm excited and I want you to get with me so we can go somewhere as many as they're led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God I am say it I am a son of God don't that feel good to say I am a Son of God how do you know that because the Bible said so the Bible said but to as many he came to his own John 1 he came to his own and his own received him not but to his many as received him to them get power to become the sons of God have you received him let me see your hand if you've received him as your savior your Messiah that's what he is a deliverer a forgiver a heart regulator a restorer a great reconciler yes the Mighty God unveiled that's who he is that's who Jesus is he's the Mighty God unveiled God didn't want to sit above us forever he wanted to come down and have fell ow fellowship with us and he did it in the body of the Lord Jesus Christ the scripture tells us in him in that Colossians in him dwelt the fullness fullness not a portion fullness of the godhead bodily so that's why Jesus could say I'm just quoting the word that's why Jesus could say when you've seen me when you've heard me come on we can say when I've touched you the father has touched you amen because I came down to reflect him for as many as are led by the spirit of God as many as received him they are the sons of God say I am a son of God now may I just mention to you that that word son there is squeals and it is a mature Son of God it is not a technon in Greek technon is an adolescent when we first start following the Lord leading trying to receive him into our spirit we are just tecton the Greek might say son but it's speaking of an immature son a toddler one who is just broaching into adolescence but in this verse when it says they are the sons of God he's talking about mature sons of God and and for those of you who studied the adoption of the Middle East you will understand that he's talking about Sons approved of the father they have graduated out from under the Tudors remember the New Testament talks about the Tudors they have graduated out from under the tutors they are now fully qualified to conduct business in the name of the father their name on the check is the very same as if his name was on the chat so you just might as well sign his name because the Bible says the whole family in heaven is named him the whole family in heaven has that name so you might as well sign your name don't sign it Joe Dole you might as well sign it Mrs Jesus Christ because he has a blank check for every believer I need some help he has a blank check for every believer you're not trying to get anything accomplished in your own name in your own authority you're doing it with all of Heaven backing you up Let the church say amen I am I am a Son of God have you received him to as many as received him to them gave he the power didn't you just say that I did I am a Son of God has he led you have you ever been led by the spirit then you are a son of God he doesn't lead other seeds he only leads Sons the the certified seed of God now let's go on and for for ye you Church New Hope because that's where I'm preaching you have not received the spirit of bondage that would cause you to fear bondage brings fear fear brings bondage you New Hope have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received another spirit hello I need some help you have received another Spirit you have received the spirit of adoption Hallelujah I am a son of God how do you know because I have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear I have received the spirit of adoption Hallelujah and so I don't have to come oh [Music] oh [Music] I really hate to disturb you but I need help please don't slay me please don't kill me because of my Humanity we always oh what in reverential fear but we do not approach him in the kind of fear that brings us into bondage people around the message are under a spirit of bondage and they're afraid to step out to be led by the spirit to encounter the reality of a living God causes them anxiety the event has sinned to Deliver Us from anxiety causes them anxiety come on because they're so afraid of the Deacons so afraid of the trustees somebody's going to come and say now hold it down you're getting too excited about the word you're distracting others because so many others aren't plugged in I'm more worried about the ones that are plugging in than the ones that are distracted because somebody else plugged in you plug in and you won't worry about somebody else plugged in Hallelujah I am Son of God I have not received again that I have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but I have received the spirit of adoption now don't misunderstand this doesn't mean that he has brought someone in who didn't belong to him this is our concept of adoption our concept of adoption is when we bring someone into our family who is not blood of our blood flesh of our flesh born of our bone and we make them hours and legally in many states you can disown your blood children you can disinherit your blood children but in many states you are not legally allowed to disinherit your adopted children so that that legal adoption's a pretty powerful thing and I'm not talking about America's concept or Europe's concept of adoption we're talking about uh the adoption in the middle and Far East we're talking about adoption in the second temple period which was not about bringing someone in who was not unfortunately in those days if you brought someone into your family that wasn't blood they were a Slave they were endangered that doesn't mean they were beaten necessarily it means they had a debt to work off so you fed them and you gave them a place to stay and they worked off their dead that was that was how a stranger was brought into your home in second temple period so the adoption that we're talking about here is not an adoption like America or like Europe but it is the adoption from the middle or Far East and that is where even a son even a blood full Bonafide son could not carry the authority of his father until he had sat under tutors and been trained and taught and finally the tutor would say Hey you have reached the place where you can receive the full authority of the father's adoption and we understand that they were brought to the gate of the city and friends and neighbors were called and a proclamation was made and usually read by a father or a a one who was appointed sometimes the Tudor and before the whole group of people that were gathered there the announcement was made this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him the exact language that was you hello the exact language that was used at the baptism of the Lord Jesus Christ wow the same adoption fully adopted bringing you into a relationship with God where you no longer have to approach him who most holy Reverend hallowed father God Supreme no that's not the believer the believer says Papa somebody said where do you get that I just read it father you have a Hebrew word in your English Bible did you know that that's a Hebrew word Abba it didn't translate they didn't translate it into English they left it Hebrew they didn't take it to the Greek and then to the English they left you one Hebrew word to hold on to didn't dilute it Abba and I've told you many many many many many times there's no place like where you where you go on air Shabbat Friday morning you buy your fresh vegetables you buy your flowers for the Shabbat table and you get everything you need for for the whole sun down the sun down Shabbat because you're not cooking and you're not you know there's so many things you're not allowed to do and so they go by the droves especially the ultra Orthodox or the Hasidic Jews and they all have eight or ten children and they all go because Mama says get out of here so daddy is the one who usually takes all the children and remember they dress up like Sunday School they are dressed in style and they go down to the dirty old shook and they are buying groceries and the children get scattered and and let me tell you something it's not just Jews it's the whole culture of the Middle East do not go to the Middle East expecting southern hospitality and manners You're Gonna Learn a Hebrew word in a hurry it really means excuse me but they can say it in such a way that it makes you feel like you big idiot get out of my way they are on a mission they don't understand cues they're not British they don't understand lines they're not American they understand that the loudest and most aggressive one among them will buy his cucumbers first Nathan knows he's been there so they are all over you and if you want a cucumber you gotta fight for it and I kind of enjoyed it I don't like to drive in Alabama but I kind of enjoy driving in Jerusalem the horn is legal at all times and sometimes you just lay on the horn and drive out of my way it's the way kids are all running around getting lost I've always told you that when we took brother West he got lost we had to hunt him and find him it took us a while to find out where he was and you know what he said he said I wasn't lost you all were lost I knew where I was the whole time but just the rest of us didn't know there is one thing you will hear every little Jewish child say at the same time it seems uh if for some reason dad didn't come it's IMA IMA IMA IMA Ima Abba doesn't mean holy most revered and astute Father of Mine Alba means Daddy Papa it's a term of endearment that you use to speak to your father isn't that powerful you have not received a spirit of bondage again to fear you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry father when life overwhelms you this week and you don't know what to do next don't melt down don't take another pill [Music] say papa [Applause] oh this scripture is telling us the spirit of adoption brings you into a unique fellowship and relationship with your God that should cause you not to move in the bondage of fear but cause you to move in the liberty of the spirit that has come to set you free if you know what I'm preaching this morning say something something amen or just say something just witness in some way now he goes on the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God I am a son of God the spirit Bears Witness the spirit of adoption the spirit remember that's one of the offices of the Holy Spirit it's the same spirit one of the offices of the holy spirit is the spirit of adoption one is the spirit of conviction one is the spirit of Revelation but we're preaching right now on the spirit of adoption same Holy Spirit just another operating work or another office of the Holy Spirit or another way that the holy spirit is identifiable and working in your life are you with me and so it gives a witness to us that we are the children of God hallelujah the Bible said you'll know you're saved by the quickening of your spirit and then they say it doesn't matter how you feel or you can't you know can't go on a Feeling when it's God you you can't say well I felt God or didn't feel god well then why did the Bible say you'll know you'll know you belong to him because your spirit will be made alive come on I'm just breaking down the verses for you the spirit itself beared witness with our spirit that we are the children of god let's go on and if children Hallelujah not just techno we're heirs Wheels mature Sons we are Heirs of God how many of you know what it means to be an heir it means a heaven inheritance [Applause] that I'm not going to Forfeit and it will never be taken from me hello I am Heirs of Papa God and I am joint heirs equal heirs someone say equal heirs with Christ no wonder the prophet comes along and says all that the father was he poured into the sun all that the son all that Christ was he poured into the church remember God was not satisfied to always live above us God above us he came as Emmanuel the Lord Jesus Christ so that he could be God With Us he came on the day of Pentecost I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you I'm going over these things again to help those of you who may have questions what you will find is what we're saying what we are saying is word based and we are not preaching something to you because brother Branham said it no I I want you to understand someone made a comment recently and said I I just I don't believe in the extra biblical stuff that that you talk about well I I I'm not sure exactly what that means but I assume that it means because we quote brother Branham you will not find a church anywhere in this region that a whole sermon will be delivered and someone will not be quoted it's the way ministers prepare their sermons might be Abraham Lincoln [Music] I I've been quoting the the coach of Muhammad Ali come on I quoted Muhammad Ali see so that is not extra biblical in the sense that if what is being said lines up with the word here I've been preaching to you for weeks that the Bible is our absolute it's not all of God one comment uh and a Christine that someone made it says too many people worship the Bible and you know what I would have to agree I would have to agree he said it to be negative but I would have to agree with him too many people worship a book and they don't know the Living Word [Applause] but this Bible is a written record of the word of God it's holy it is without mistake it is inerrant it is our absolute if something doesn't line up with this word it's false I don't care who said it I don't care if your preacher said it or William Branham the prophet said it or or are the Elders of the Mormon Church said it it must it has to it has to line up you you can't even learn to follow a message without some sort of absolute to take that to and that's why I can follow this message with all my heart it's because I preach what I can take back to the word and we must do that if children then we're heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs meaning equal heirs with Christ he also received an inheritance of the father you receive an inheritance of the father if so be that we suffer with him that's part of the Judgment process now that we may be you read it for me would you also glorified how together anybody with me for I reckon I just love it when Paul gets Southern for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in a soul bless the Lord for the earnest expectation of the creature wait wait for the manifestation of I am I am a son of God you won't always have to take my word for it I won't always have to take your word for it because one of these days God is going to manifest through you Who You Are and the world's going to know maybe not the masses are going to know but those around you are going to know that when you say I'm a Son of God it's not cheap talk but you have everything you need to back it up and until then the body groans oh does it ever Creak and groan when I'm through preaching I either go out to eat on Sunday or go home and eat I sit in the chair usually by that time and I don't want your sympathy I just sometimes want you to understand that when I can't stay around and talk to all of you like I would like to sometimes I can sometimes I simply can't and it's because until I receive the fullness of the manifestation of who I am and healing is completed and perfected in my body the reality is I don't have a day without pain and the closest that I come to it without pain most of the time 99 of the time if I'm sitting or standing or kneeling in the swimming pool I'm so thankful that our shallow end is shallow enough that I can kneel on my knees and I spent hours there yesterday kneeling on my knees in the shallow without any pressure on my sciatic nerve or my joints and I don't want to move because sometimes just moving out and sitting on a chair to dry off to go in the pain comes back and so that's how I spend a lot of my Sunday afternoons Mondays I spend as many Mondays as possible the same way not because I I want a suntan however I do believe that everybody looks a little better where the little Sun that's just my humble opinion but you won't find me you know I'm not sprawled out like a lizard turning my foot this way and that way so that it can get a suntan rolling up things and I don't have to do that that's not my joy my joy is being where the pain is not there and so please understand that sometimes after service I've already stood during worship and now during the preaching and sometime during worship again and praying for the sick I can't always do it you know why because this old creature well I heard I heard the preacher say I heard Daryl brother Daryl Ward say this week we're dying he said we're just dying brother said the same thing we're dying this body that we live in is dying and it must happen it must happen has to happen we don't like it but thank God it don't all happen at one time aren't you glad that you don't most of the time you don't just go from you know great health and life lesson uh what they call an accident happens or something but but you know it's a process of decaying thank you Jesus but there is an expectation that we have in in this body waiting oh if I can just find my time if I can just press into Christ if I can just bury myself in the word if I can just let Christ be formed in the belly of my spirit hello then I'm going to have the manifestation of full adoption whereby we cry out the father and where we show who we are as the sons of God named body has to yield to the manifestation of the sons of God if God could do it for Abraham and Sarah he can turn your clock back and I'm believing you I'm believing I'm not expecting to continue to decline I'm expecting to to to climb Hallelujah I'm expecting that to close Glory Hallelujah Glory I'm expecting that as we get closer and closer to that manifestation of the sons of God that even our bodies starts obeying our confession because we're not speaking in our own authority we're speaking in Authority as sons of God as Heirs of God as coheirs with Jesus Christ anybody with me I gotta hurry I I'm I'm on the I'm just reading the text for the earnest expectation the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God let's go on for for the creature was made subject to vanity do you believe it not willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in Hope God knew what he was doing he's a sovereign-minded god because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glory glorious Liberty Hallelujah of the children of God how many of you'd like to live in the Glorious Liberty of the children of God hallelujah I don't mean become a religious weirdo I mean just manifest Who You Are for we know the whole creation not just the body all of creation the Earth itself the oceans the Seas of the Earth the volcanoes Hawken and his family just took a 10 mile hike in to see the the volcano that's erupting in Iceland I'm going to be having to take my Tour on a helicopter I don't believe I'm going to be making an unless the creature starts manifesting who he is in the next few weeks I doubt I'm going in because you know what I found out about a 10 mile hike I took one of you years back you know what I found out you got to come out you can almost always make it crawling but then you got to come out and by the time I came out of that when I couldn't even hardly put my foot down to climb down off the trail and so anyway uh that volcano that is belching itself sending that molten lava up into the air it's groaning it's travailing in pain together until now did you know that even the earth and the surface of the Earth and the crust of the Earth the ocean of the earth and the underground volcanoes of the earth and even underground oceans of the earth they are all belching and travailing and groaning so that you and I can manifest who we are as sons of God do you know why because they're looking for somebody to have a complete and entire dominion over them [Applause] they were created to be to be dominated of in control Adam was placed in the earth and he controlled every part of creation it's been almost six thousand years that the Earth has not had that kind of authority operating in the earth like Adam the closest thing and the most powerful thing that happened was two thousand years ago the Creator came down in a body of flesh but he didn't come for the purpose of having dominion over all the elements he came for the purpose of becoming the sinless Spotless lamb who was crucified and shed his life's blood so that you and I could be redeemed are you with me but we have got so much to look forward to I've got to hurry now hmm and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit that's me even we ourselves grown within ourselves hallelujah oh help me Lord oh I need you Jesus I find myself many many times oh Jesus I Need You Lord I've got to have you Lord I need you more today than I did yesterday oh God I need you Lord I need you Lord I I want you I don't just need you I want you I want who you are I want you to be real in my life and that's what the Apostle said even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the Redemption of our body our Inner Man coming to the Abba Father Spirit of adoption now he's talking about a time when our physical bodies will give way and that Spirit of adoption will even bring the molecules of our flesh into perfect synchronization with the word of God no disease can live in a body like that hello you really believe there's going to be a diseaseless body in the earth before the rat oh yes I do it will be part of the quick short work you may only have 30 to 40 days to enjoy that kind of Health but then you'll have eternity I can get a lot done I don't know about you but in a painless body where the Holy Ghost charge in every cell of my body I could get a whole lot done in one month Hallelujah I could call a lot of resurrections out in one I'm just giving you what he said I'm only trying to make it practical a storm try to come up and stop the bride's Revival oh no a tumor try to crop up in your body when you're in that oh no I speak you out I command you to go [Applause] can you imagine a cancer-free Zone if only for 30 to 40 days where the bride does not did you know that every one most every one of us in this room have mutated cells in our body right now that if they continue to divide as they are they are cancerous cells did you know that your immune system defeats cancer in your body on a daily basis it arrests the cells and that's why there are amazing things that you can do for yourself to help your DNA and to help your body heal itself on a cellular level so that you have the strength to continue to fight off mutation when your body sees the cell mutating in the wrong way it sins white blood cells its sins other chemicals and chemistries of the body to go and start killing that cell off but if your immune system cannot fight that then it continues to multiply depending on what kind of mutation it is and you all know they're faster growing and slower growing kinds of cancer do not fear cancer you cannot fear it and that's why I'm here to tell you it's it's happening it's happening in these old bodies cells are mutating but we're going to come to an hour where every cell that multiplies in our body is perfect and whole somebody said I don't want anybody to hear that we believe this well don't tell them I just happen to believe the God who did it the first time can do it again I just happen to believe Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever and I happen to believe all of that makes up a part of the full manifestations of the sons of God the fullness of the spirit of adoption the bride's Revival the fullness of the third pool we could go on and on the coming of the Capstone all the things that we have yeah come on I happen to believe that it really happens I happen to believe we don't just talk about being in it for 50 years and we can't even produce enough religion to get our teenagers prayed through [Applause] I'm talking about a time where we have the goods God will see to that you and I are in the process of getting all the junk out now so that he can come in and have his way and not only they but ourselves which are the first fruits all right let's go on Are we almost to the end next verse is that the last what verse was that when the verses aren't on there I have no idea what verse we're reading that was verse 23 so we no that wasn't 23 what verse was it again tell me oh sorry my page turned forgive me praise God Hallelujah we're done with that turn to Matthew chapter one oh it's ten after one we have lots of time I'm just rushing here we have lots of time didn't seem like you were Russian pastor I was King James and Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary of whom was born Jesus who is called Christos Christos Christos in English it's Christ in Greek it's Christos it means the anointed one when we read in the Old Testament as we did in Psalm 2 the anointed or his anointed the word is the mashiach or the Messiah the the Messiah means the anointed one Christos Christ is the anointed one so of whom was born Jesus who is called Messiah mashiach Christos Christ the anointed one he is the Messiah he is the anointed one and so when we read Christ we can read the word Messiah it is the equivalent of the Hebrew word mashiach in the Amplified it tells us that I want to read it to show you how the Amplified will do sometime to really help you with it with the full meaning of a word Jacob the father of Joseph the husband of Mary of whom was born Jesus who is called the Christ the Messiah the anointed in Luke chapter 2 verse 11 King James For unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christos Christ the anointed one the Messiah the Lord we could say Messiah or we could say uh who is which is mashiach Adonai Lord is Adonai in Hebrew so if you hear someone say bashem it means in the name bashem Adonai Lord Yeshua Jesus Son Christ Christos the anointed one so to say Lord Jesus Christ is to say the name of the father Lord Adonai the son Jesus Christ the anointed one or the anointing which is the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit how many of you understand that and that's why brother Branham said we don't baptize in Jesus name only because there may be many jesuses but there's only one Lord Jesus Christ Adonai Yeshua hamashiach Lord Jesus Christ father son and the Bible said in the father this is New Testament now and the father hath chosen him and highly exalted him and given him a name that is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow and every tongue should confess these are not teachings that we have pulled out of our ears these are years and years and years of studying the scripture and receiving Revelation by the Holy Spirit if it lines up with the Bible it doesn't matter whether it lines up with Grandma's religion or not if it lines up with the word you see we're not basing what we preach on the Apostles Creed we're not basing it on the Roman Catholic church or system we're basing it on the absolute written record of the word amen and I think you know that I believe you know that there are many Orthodox doctrines of the church that cannot even be found in the Holy Scripture for instance Holy Trinity is mentioned nowhere not one single solitary place in the Bible the word doesn't appear and did you know that even extreme trinitarians I read some articles recently where extreme trinitarians who actually believe in three gods did you know there are some most believed that the Trinity is made up of three distinct and eternal persons now that Eternal gets me because you can't be an eternal son and the three persons is what we have oppose not you you could even you know if you really needed uh some description you could even say personality now I don't like to say that because when we think of Personality we think of what a person but you could look at it as a demonstration or you could look at it as an office but did you know there's not one single verse in the New Testament where all three are mentioned as three distinct persons or three distinct individuals at all it's just simply not there but doesn't the church teach that at large yes and have since 325. somewhere between 150 and 250 A.D the first writings appeared using the word Trinity so I just thought you might find it interesting that for a hundred years nobody even used the word and it was not until 325 A.D that that writings begin to appear and the church adopted such a concept of God and they they confess in the early writings of the church fathers which I have read by the way and it's some of the most boring reading that you'll ever do you have to skip to some interesting places but you will find that they said that the concept of three persons in the godhead was birthed out of the many pagans who were coming through Rome to the church who had been worshiping hundreds pluralities of Gods and so when they tried to explain who God was they could not explain him in the in the biblical sense of one spirit and so they chose this this description of persons which is very very confusing to many people and even articles of extreme trinitarians that I read recently say things like this there is no a clear indication of the Holy Trinity mentioned anywhere in the New Testament these are trinitarians saying this do you know what they say next it is only implied implied now you're going to base your whole belief system on implication I thought we were here to read the absolute I'm I'm just trying to help you I thought the word of God was to be the absolute I didn't know that we had to follow it by by implications I thought the Holy Spirit had come to make that word so real that nothing had to be implied or assumed it's got to line up may God help us all because we have to learn I didn't know it I did not know it God had to deal with my heart it's been a long journey it's been a 30 uh plus year 1988 when God began to reveal the truth from the scripture concerning the godhead 1988 that's a long time and you know what I hadn't quitting I hadn't quit studying it I look at it often because I want to make these scriptures come alive when we read them and look at them together for for under you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is mashiach Adonai Christ the lord let's look at the Amplified for to you is Born This Day in the town of David a savior who is Christ the Messiah the Lord so Webster defines Messiah as a title given to the promised deliverer of the Jewish Nation as prophesied in the Hebrew Bible did you follow that Messiah is derived or mashiach in Hebrew is derived from the Hebrew word excuse me sorry messiah in English is derived from the Hebrew word mashiach which means anointed one and which corresponds to the New Testament title of Christ which is Christos or anointed the anointed one anointed of what of the Holy Spirit who is God I will not leave you I will come to you now uh I want to want you to understand this morning that we are going to make some quotations here before we go and this is kind of what I struggle with because I don't want anyone I think most of you know where we stand but I don't want anyone to think that I am trying to introduce to you the things that brother Branham said as extra biblical or entirely equal to the Bible now I know there are people who believe that it is entirely in its entirety equal to the scripture I can't believe that because in order to do that I would have to call them both absolute and there has to be one absolute and everything else has to base on that or lay on the foundation of that absolute so I'm not presenting these quotes to introduce to you something extra biblical as some might assume I'm doing it to help you understand that that God desired for you and I to be able to understand the scripture and sometimes we just needed somebody who'd tie one scripture with the next and we say I got it that's really what preaching does preaching is foolishness it seems so foolish to have to get up and scream [Music] but God chose the foolishness of preaching to deliver the word of God to them that believe don't you see that and so unless I get up here and the only thing I do is read the scripture I could do that I could stand up here for two hours and just read the Bible but we wouldn't always come to a closer understanding of what we had read we needed some help and God promised him the scripture that he would send the help we need aren't you glad he did the spoken word is the Original Seed paragraph 204 so this is presented as something that we can lay in the absolute this is to me if it says the same thing if it is saying the same thing that the word says then it becomes a part of the absolute if I get up here today and I preach to you what the word of God says I'm delivering to you the absolute if I give you my opinion then that's not the absolute if I give you my supposition or what I think it might be that's not the absolute but if I take the scripture and break it down and give you only the word with some understanding of that word then we could say that also is the absolute because it's based on the word of God I hope that helps somebody what was he he made himself a man God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the word was made flesh and dwelt among us remember last week John 1 God's spoken word through a virgin brought forth a body you believe that don't you the Bible said Mary was overshadowed by the father the scripture said by the Holy Spirit which is the eternal spirit of the father and in that body Washed by the Water of the word follow this can you give me my time and then with him went in him dwelt in him and there come the life of God manifesting himself through Christ God was in Christ Messiah the anointed one do you understand that that's all I tried to read all those verses for was to help you see that's what the word says Christ means the anointed one a man that was anointed and God dwelling in him can you agree with that who was it The Germ with the flesh the anointed one meaning the seed of God with flesh on it now flesh being Anointed with the spirit of God produced whoa this is telling us about him but somehow my little faith is putting myself in here too because read the way look at the way it was read flesh I got flesh anybody got flesh being Anointed with the spirit of God anybody got anointed by the spirit of God produce what the word of God made manifest or as we preached last Sunday the word of God made flesh and we beheld him the only begotten of the father full of grace see now it becometh us to righteousness paragraph 88 and I got to go quick so that we don't have to be here all morning all day all afternoon Aaron the high priest before he could ever be anointed he had to be washed with water don't you love that before he could ever go into the holy Place receive the anointing and service and Minister unto the Lord he had to wash in the Holy labor right according to the Old Testament so then how could we come along and say the Old Testament is obsolete you see I can take this statement made by a man under the inspiration and unction of the Holy Spirit I can take that word all the way back to both the New Testament and the Old Testament and show you where that is a word based statement Aaron the high priest and the priest who followed him in the aaronic order they had to be one for he could be anointed our high priest he was washed with water let's go on and then that anointing oil poured upon him to anoint him like Aaron was anointed with oil he was anointed with the Holy Ghost can anybody tell me when he was anointed with water at his baptism uh let's go on for John bear records seeing the spirit of God descending like a dove and going upon him and a voice say this is my oh they say wait a minute there's two to what there's a voice and a person not two people a voice God is a spirit the Bible says I'm not making that up God is a spirit and they that worship Him must he doesn't have a physical form unless he comes in the Sun he may appear as a fire pillar of fires the anointing remember last week he may come as a pillar of fire he may come as a rainbow he may come as a cloud he may come as an angel but the spirit of the father has no physical body of his own but he has a voice [Music] the spirit has a voice and the voice spoke out this is my beloved Son in whom I am pleased to dwell so the Bible said Jesus was anointed with the Holy Ghost went about doing good things so now we have two scripture we have the baptism and we have the scripture that says he was anointed with the Holy Ghost and went about doing good things see he was anointed if he was anointed what does that make him the Messiah someone say the Messiah the mashiach can you say that mashiach mashiach there you go you'd make good Jews or Germans if you can get that before he was anointed before he was anointed he had to you see that's what come down in the form of a dove that was the anointing it was God coming down the form of Dove to anoint him why because he had been washed in the water every offering not only did the priest have to be washed in the water did you know that every offering had to be washed every lamb had to be washed every offering had to be washed and anointed and here we have Jesus fulfilling the very righteousness of the law before he was anointed he had to fulfill all righteousness see he had to be washed with water before the anointing could come upon him isn't that powerful in that powerful don't let that stumble you he was the anointing he was the word made flesh but once you put the word in a fleshly body you have condescended you brought the word down and that word again had to be anointed had to be washed in water and had to be anointed by the Holy Spirit Hallelujah so that it could be equal to God that physical body I don't want to confuse you but that physical body was not equal to God see he had to be washed with water before the anointing come upon him and it's a very beautiful type of us today hey let's go on paragraph 91. and it's a very beautiful type of us today as priests unto God we must be first baptized have you been baptized have you been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ did you know if you've not been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you ought to because in doing so you may open up your life to the anointing and the anointing will open your eyes and let you see the reality of the word without baptism you've not been properly washed just throwing that out there we know it's an internal washing of the water of the word but we also know that that the whole reason why we have the external demonstration of water baptism is to fulfill all righteousness according to the law and that we're washing the sacrifice we're getting ready for the anointing to fall on it no wonder Peter said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the anointing and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost isn't that powerful not many days from now all right so uh see wash first and then anointed for service no Minister should enter that Pulpit without first being baptized in the name of Jesus Christ because all remission of sins is only in Jesus Christ's name no not another name under Heaven given among men now if I didn't believe that was a word based statement I wouldn't be reading it here today I want you to understand that there are a few statements on the tapes that I believe are misspoken and I Don't Preach those quotes because I can't take them back to the Bible you understand I'm not saying it's not true I'm just saying it it seems to be misspoken because it doesn't line up with the word oh you're just trying to point out the mistake oh to the contrary I've defended this word as much as anyone in this room I wouldn't begin to unravel it now but I have an obligation to stay with the book and you do too so if I didn't believe that this was based right on the absolute word of God I wouldn't be presenting in here this morning amen so repentance and remission of sin must be taught in his name beginning at Jerusalem that's where the Holy Ghost fell and anointed first so a minister or any believer must first be washed from his sins in the name of Jesus Christ and the anointing with the Holy Ghost to bring forth a testimony for God see that now another sirs we would see Jesus paragraph 26 oh I wish you can stay can you stay a few more can you stay a little bit longer notice the first thing he did after his temptation in the wilderness he came forth as the anointed Messiah the Messiah the Messiah the Christ Christ means the anointed one he was born Jesus the man or we could say Yeshua his Hebrew name but when the Holy Ghost came into him he was the anointed Messiah always the word made flesh but until the Holy Ghost came on him not the anointed Messiah can you follow that the Bible said in this to me oh my this settled so many questions the Bible said God was in Christ reconciling himself to the world oh how could he be any lesser God if God was in him reconciling himself to The World God living in him fullness of this of The Sinner Christ poured all he was into the church this is in Tifton Georgia my my right down the road on the day of Pentecost when they were assembled together when that Pillar of Fire came down it divided with cloven tongues and sat upon each of them showing that God was dividing himself among the people now I only want to read uh sweetheart I only want to read and that's not charity I'm talking to she's not up there uh a paragraph 110. I only want to read 110 of questions and answers number two I read this last week but I didn't I don't know that I come all the way to the end so I just want to read last paragraph and I'm moving on best I can now this logos that was in him which was the spirit of God the anointing through the sanctifying grace of the blood brought many sons to God do you believe that which is Anointed with this is every son Anointed with the same logos that's what he's telling us that's what the word says is that right now I want you to go to a scripture with me for just a moment first John everybody okay and also we're working a little at it but that's all right first John 2 27 through 29 but the I want you to listen for because I want you to see you but the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you and ye need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teaching you teacheth you of all things and is truth and is no lie and even as it hath taught you ye shall abide in him you've got to be anointed you need to be water baptized washed and cleansed you need to repent of your sins and have your sins covered by the blood of Jesus Christ then you need that anointing that comes with the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you don't have the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost you cannot interpret the word of God for yourself you've got to have the ice have you've got to have the Revelation that comes when the anointing falls on you what is the anointing he said it was the same logos that was on Christ Jesus I don't know why some of you look a little confused and you you are normally right with me so I hope I if you've if you've heard me misspeak please tell me if I did say a little something that sometimes I do that if I misspoke please correct me now or help me uh text me or something if I said something in a wrong order or something I'm certainly human and I might have done it I'm trying to understand why some look a little lost because I hadn't gotten to nothing yet I feel like I'm still in the ABCs and now little children abide in him oh I love that word abide and we will make our abode with him it's easy to abide in him when he has made his Abode in you you get it you get it and now little children abide in him remain in him can I tell you something it's not automatic abiding in him requires something it's a cooperation it's a participation it's not automatic abide in him that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming let me tell you something God has made a way so that when he comes nobody will have to run and hide like Adam did you'll be able to step out in the clearing and say Here I Am Lord not because you did any good or I did any good but because the way has been made God came in Christ reconciling us to himself if ye know that he is righteous you know that everyone that doeth righteousness is born of him are we there hallelujah it's a very a very important verse of scripture but but in verse 27 right back to the beginning let's look at it again he said but the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you now that word anointing is charisma Charisma not not Charisma the name of a magazine charisma it's a Greek word it means unction it means anointing it also means to smear oil you know you don't just need a drop on your forehead you need an anointing that rubs that oil that a holy anointing it rubs it past the flesh past the emotion right down into the to the inner Spirit of man that's what we've got to have is that right do you know what else it means anointing Charisma but the anointing but the Charisma which ye have received of him abideth in you it also means the reception of spiritual privileges it also means a supernatural sanction I'm reading it from the Lexicon that's not a leprechaun that's a lexicon it's the word we use it's a Greek dictionary that will tell us what Greek word is used for every word in the New Testament and what it means in the reception of spiritual privileges it also means a supernatural sanction as though a voice saying this one is mine so when the verse said but the anointing which you have received of him abideth in you that anointing that's being described is a blessing it's an endowment it's a supernatural sanction from on high it's an unction it's the very same concept that causes us to call Christ the anointed one and what is the other word the Old Testament word we use for the anointed one Messiah mashiach once he was anointed he became the anointed Messiah or the mashiach is that right now what about you what about you in the message the Messiah Shreveport Louisiana the time that I have left I'm going to be reading from this message I encourage you to hear it I I probably should have just let them pull it up and play that little portion for you instead of me reading it he wouldn't have been distracted he'd have stayed or I don't text now we're made up of light meters inside of us is Cosmic light now that Cosmic light is a light that they can take an x-ray with the X-ray doesn't come from the X-ray light it comes from your own light you're seeing a picture of you're seeing a negative when you see an x-ray when they put the X-ray up on the screen there you're seeing a negative that means it has struck the positive that's what the prophet is telling us that bone there that white thing is is your body testifying to that machine that you're you've got something on the inside of you now if if that Cosmic light say could be pushed into a place where no no not Cosmic light but Eternal Light God could dwell supremely to do our thinking do our walking do our talking then it's no longer the man read it it's God in the man what does that sound like to you adoption sons of God full adoption sons of God the word made flesh are you with me he said I suppose I'm deafening You by this thing because I hear it rebound it's got an awful voice it isn't me is it it's this now now see lay it on that uh he's got life eternal life it's the light of God that dwells in the man and if he will yield to the spirit more he becomes unmanned sinner like and becomes more don't let that disturb you you do remember what Jesus said to the Pharisees don't you your law says that men are Gods little G you're disturbed because I tell you I'm the Son of God or because something like that has been your your scripture says ye are gods when it speaks of the prophets this is what Jesus said that's red letter so don't let this little simple Kentucky English disturb you because this is a great truth based solely on the Bible he said here not long ago they took an x-ray of a man praying for a sick man Reader's Digest wrote it up and found out a ray of light coming from one of the men not all of them but one of the man's hands reflected a ray of light when they put a piece of lead foil beneath the man's hand I guess you read it yourself I read it yourself it's gone in England they turned the healers they call them loose to all the hospitals and there was 80 percent more healing done by Divine Healing then medical cures had performed Readers Digest picked it up over here that was in Newsweek and readers died just picked it up and tried it and they find that there is a ray of light when this man sincerely not knowing they were doing it put his hands upon a man and prayed and Earnest prayer they was putting the X-ray down and found out a light was coming from his hand that was Cosmic light that was eternal light that was God's light you're supposed to be he tells us hundreds of times you're supposed to be the light in the darkness that little church bride that little bride is supposed to be the light in the Darkness now God knew what he talked about when he said lay hands on the sick and they shall recover he knows that he what he was speaking of oh I want to see the church press into that place where it can come like God wants it to be you're still here then we're getting getting juicy now you see all them yellows yellow letters come up then when God was made flesh and became the Messiah then if we can yield ourselves to be anointed like he was if we let's read it together if we can yield ourselves to be the anointed like he was again if you don't mind I know I'm I'm getting on your nerves then if we can yield ourselves to be the anointed like he was have mercy don't that do anything to anybody am I the only one in here something I don't know where I I wouldn't even know how to define it but there is something maybe a seed or something I don't know what it but there is something on the inside of me that when I read that it just starts doing flips and flops there's something on the inside of me that says that is your destiny that wasn't just for brother Branham there's something on the inside of me that says that's for the little bride then if we can yield ourselves to be the anointed like he was we become now now before we go any further I want to help you I've had a talk with Webster when you add e-t-t-e it to a word it's a suffix you know not a prefix not on the front of the word but on the back of the word right when you add e-t-t-e a suffix used to form nouns meaning a similar form of something also used to form nouns meaning or implying the female equivalent of let me read it again a suffix used to form nouns meaning a smaller form of something also used to form nouns meaning or implying the female equivalent of now that that last part of that has been very offensive I didn't know it but it's been very offensive lately to the to the women's movement just just without a lot of sermon here if you are hauling your children down to see the Barbie movie there is something very seriously wrong in your head I wouldn't even let my daughters play when they were growing up with Barbie dolls because it was sexuality that was being presented to them as little children you never saw how many of you know that every woman's body is not built like Barbie every woman's chest is not built like Barbie and to put that on a little girl I couldn't do it I couldn't do it have you read the list of things they're saying about the Barbie movie Ken is an idiot says it Barbie is the queen she she is it there's two gay men Googling over Kian you won't take your little children down sit them down in front of that Barbie is the hero of the world sexist sexy and worldly Christians posting I'm giving my granddaughter a Barbie party something is seriously wrong with the Holy Ghost when you add e-t-t-e it's a suffix used to form nouns meaning a smaller form of something sometimes used to imply the female equivalent of so if we said the Messiah if I were to come along and use the word Messiah based on the definition the definition means a smaller form of something so if I were to call you a messiah I'm calling you a smaller form of him is that offensive and I might also be calling you the female version now that might get some men a little ticked but that's the bridal paradigm so if I were to say or you were to hear Brother random say we are Messiahs you you're not being told that you are the Messiah when Jesus referred to the writings of the prophets of gods with a little G he wasn't telling them that they were the god you see I I remember that when the sermons of brother Branham were first published they were published by an organization called the spoken word because that's what it was the confusion started when it made that transition from the spoken word to the voice of God because that is not a pie little geez I don't care what they say about me it's implying something more than should be applied implied absolutely so brother random is not telling us in this word Messiah that we become the Messiah big him or ask God's Big G he said little lies and here's three quick examples of the word with an e-t-t-e a statuette you ever heard the word statuette it means a small sculpture of a person or an animal which is often displayed on a shelf or a stand and not stand alone like a statue would a statuette a layette how many of your mothers know what Alaya is they don't even call it look look at the Stacy look around these young mothers that don't even know what a lay Ed is it's a word that's obsolete now it's not even used you used to go to a baby shower to receive your layout it means a small set or kit consisting of a complete outfit for a new baby how many of your mamas got layets and didn't even know what you got what a world we living in anybody know what a butt red is not a beret a barrette it is a small clip for holding hair in place any mother that brings me a little baby with a bow bigger than their head I look at them like what have you got here a baby not a poodle when Ashley come in I don't remember it was Tuesday night or Sunday but she brought in a beautiful little dress on on akiana and a little nice little bowl all in proportion little band a little boy I said Thank you thank you Ashley for not putting one of them big old bows the beauty is the baby not the size of the bow to each his own there's no Doctrine there do what you want to but when I look at it it just reminds me of something like Dolly overdone [Music] so if we say Messiah we mean a smaller version of Messiah with with the implication of a female form so a female form of a smaller version of Messiah if that disturbs you I don't even know what to say I went to all the trouble of talking to you all about layets and barrettes and just just to try to help you understand he's not trying to say you're Jesus but I miss this Jesus Christ [Applause] what the word teaches he said we become Messiahs little lights that's what the church is supposed to be lights little anointed ones that's God's church is there anybody that would be bold enough to say that doesn't seem to line up with the word come on I just hear that all through the word I don't hear the term Messiah but I hear the word the term manifested sons of God the spirit of adoption sons of God revealed to as many as as could could receive him to them to as many as are led by they are sons of God same thing you are not the big son of God your little sons of God you're not the big ill Messiah oh Hallelujah we're just smaller forms in the female Hallelujah of what he was and whether you can see it or not with unanointed eyes I pray you get some anointing on your eyes so that you can see it it's The Sweetest Love Story that's ever been told that God God almighty God holy Sovereign and supreme was not at peace to dwell alone he wanted to create me so that he might have fellow yeah relationship with me with you are you still here his standing light is the light of Messiah risen Christ in his people the anointed ones carrying forth his light into all the church ages sometimes it almost goes completely out are you with me I got four minutes here then it comes back again God's anointed one God's Messiah mess Messiah I guess he's saying Church if we use that word we would say Messianic simply meaning of the Messiah if Messiah means the anointed one and means king then if the church is Anointed by the Messiah Spirit it becomes a lesser is he making it clear would you dare call this false Doctrine nothing but the truth lesser but still a messiah a light an anointed one in the dark dark world if you can't be a light on the volleyball court you can never be a light in a dark dark world we must only every one of us all of us we must remember who we are if you can't be a driver a conscientious driver and be light if you can't show courtesy in the line if you can't grab somebody else's buggy while you're taking yours back [Music] you can't stop stop and pick up a piece of trash or pit because you think somebody else's job is to do it you can't be a light in the dark world come on you really believe I do I really do I really do I believe we have to shine wherever we are I believe we have to shine in all circumstances I believe we've got to shine in here and we gotta shine out there I believe it matters what we say I believe it all matters are you with me 10 minutes musicians you can just start to come walk very slow if Messiah means you're anointing one it means king then if the church is Anointed by the Messiah Spirit it becomes a lesser but still a messiah because it has his light reflecting his power reflecting his glory come on Church reflecting his Dominion so it is Messiah oh how it reflects him in his kingdom in his domain did you know you put him back on the throne by being a light to your generation did you know you give him back the Dominion that's due him when you are a light to your generation let's go on the trouble today guess what the trouble is we've organized the church to death hello hello hello hello hello hello we've got to have a board for everything got to have a board God to have a board Communications board got to have a board got to have a pastoral calling board we've got to have a come on we've got to have a financial board we've got to have a group of this uh gotta figure out how to organize that and for years we didn't even ask people what they were bringing to a dinner we do it now because we have a slightly different generation than the one we had then and we just want to make sure that we get enough of the different things because sometimes people think well if I don't like it nobody else does and that's not always the case maybe you don't like relish on your hot dog but maybe somebody else does so we got to have somebody to bring relish you understand what I'm saying but but before in the old day we never sent a list we never ask people to breathe we didn't we never had to I remember when it shifted it did shift and there were times that we didn't seem to have enough for everybody not enough for them to have everything they would want and it began so we so we had to pull a little bit and do a little bit more and now you people have risen to the cause and you are amazing and sometimes I wonder how in the world you do it and get it all done and bring it over here to feed one another and to feed visitors who come you're absolutely amazing my point is in the old days it was just kind of like the spirit of the Lord without any organization by man it was just like the spirit of the Lord would put it on people's hearts what to do I remember a time when the church never supplied a napkin never supplied a fork never Supply the plate now we don't mind because God helps us and blesses us and makes it possible and we did a Sam's run this week nearly a 200 Sam's run to get us ready to make sure we have everything we need including paper towels and that's why I'd be such a blessing if you would take your children into the washroom and show them how to use one paper towel two in the most I have people come and tell me sometime I was in there with the kids and they take eight or ten well I can't be in there to monitor that but it'd be just so great if one would do the job but in the so we have to keep all that in the paper and the tissues and whatever we we try the best we can but in the old days somebody would see a box of forks on sale and they would say I'm throwing them in the Boogie and we'd get up there and and Mike would nearly run out and somebody said oh no I've gotta I've got a box of Fortune in the truck what I am saying is sometimes we we over think and over organize and we don't give the spirit of God the opportunity and sometimes if we don't organize a little bit one or two people do it all and it should never be that way it should be a body function you understand what I'm saying I don't get hung up on plates and forks I'm not even preaching about that or or or too many people bring corn never it couldn't happen somebody said one time sister uh probes didn't bring deviled eggs because she thought there might be somebody else might be bringing them and they and they're wouldn't and she took some home I said nobody told me she took them home you can never have too many deviled eggs they're Angel eggs and you need them in a picnic isn't it amazing what the spirit of the Lord can do when we let him do I'm using something very silly but I've watched God orchestrate a service I've watched him put a camp meeting together Hallelujah let's not organize the church to death he said we've got organization instead of Messiah light we've got russellite prosely and may I humbly add branamite and all other kinds of light but we need Messiah light what the church needs today and should I have said shelly-eyed you don't need that either what we need today is the light of the Messiah oh I love him for his goodness anybody with me whoa now that's true God called Messiahs God called us and we become Kings and Priests unto God Like Jesus was God's high priest we become what a lesser priest Jesus was God in fullness dwelt in him to shine forth the expression of God to the world for God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself and his God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself God comes into his church and anoints him some Messiahs I can't show you the word Messiah but I don't have to take you to where it's implied I can take you to where he stated Greater Works Greater Works remember he said it's not greater quality it's greater quantity Greater Works than this shall you do Greater Works somebody say Greater Works you let some Messiahs get busy and greater work all right Greater Works will show up Among Us Hallelujah God comes into his church don't look at the church God comes in this church and anoints him some Messiah so my do you see it the same the search the same power he had is in his church and the CH and his church becomes his dominion and he's King over this dominion and we are Kings and Priests lesser Kings lesser priests but nonetheless Kings and Priests offering spiritual sacrifices to God that's what we were doing [Laughter] that's what we were doing in the morning spiritual sacrifices to God the fruit of our lips giving praise foreign to his name amen oh my there you are Messiahs Messiahs little Messiahs little anointing ones anointed of what anointed of what the main one anointed off of the he's not even trying to take something for himself he's not trying to put something on us that doesn't belong to us just write back to the word where are these sons of God where are these men and women doing Greater Works hmm paragraph 26 I'm not doing I might have to hold on to get through it now that was for messiah oh I just hear him I hear him I can hear it remember there are churches out there that don't even believe in miracles we some of the comments that were made these things ceased foreign someone spoke to one of the young Brothers in the church and said that the this that Holy Ghost baptism and all that that is you know of the devil that that ceased with the apostles listen you you don't have to go anywhere to church you don't want to go because you will find I could find you could find everybody can find a place somewhere that'll say it just like they want it to be said and if that's what folks are looking for they can find it we have folks who love us but can't come to church with us because they call our music Wild and some of them came from a church a church is where they didn't believe in playing musical instruments and so to come and sit in worship like this is more than they but they love us and they love a lot of what is preached here but they can't be apart because of the music and there are others who love the music and love the worship but can't swallow the truth the doctrine of Truth it but but you can't let that disturb your peace because there's something out there for everybody are you really preaching that with all my heart with all my heart I was told many years ago I wasn't called to lead everybody it's a hard hard lesson to learn because you want to when you like people when you love people but you can't always do it and there's always going to be so myself that was for the Messiah that was for the early church they say things like there are no musical instruments mentioned in the New Testament they didn't have to be because they were so well established in the Old Testament nobody had to come along and say well it's all right to still play the drum or the symbol or the guitar or whatever nobody had to say that because everybody knew that it was all right and it was a part of the way that people were called to worship God praise him on the loud standing symbols and praise him on the tavern praise him on the heart and praise it didn't change so there's no need to talk about it sometimes a good dose of Common Sense would help people interpret the scripture the Holy Ghost we need for sure but sometimes just a little common sense or studying just a little bit to know what hour it was spoken what was going on in that day Saint John 14 12 Jesus said he that believeth on me somebody say Saint John 14 12. 14 12 John 14 12 Jesus said he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also brother for him said Messiahs that's right Messiahs the representation of Messiah on Earth yet let's go on Mark 16 he said go ye into all the word and preach the gospel these signs shall follow the Messiahs he that believeth that is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be down and these signs shall follow them that believe are there any believers here how far to all the world who too every creature oh I'm so glad how are you going to rub that out said it's just only to the disciples to the disciples he said to all the world and every creature these signs shall follow them that believe I wonder where people that don't believe in signs and wonders following the Believers how would you ever read the history of the church and think it ceased with the apostles in the church ages it just continued down through he said I read the nice I feel sorry for your brother bam that's hard reading
