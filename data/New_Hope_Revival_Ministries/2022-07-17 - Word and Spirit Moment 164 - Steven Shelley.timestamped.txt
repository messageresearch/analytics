[0:00] it's how much of god's word goes through
[0:02] you
[0:03] because digestive in the spiritual is
[0:07] revelation
[0:15] so both word and spirit
[0:19] both truth
[0:21] and supernatural vindication was
[0:24] represented in the ark of the covenant
[0:25] now where's the ark of the covenant now
[0:28] i don't mean where is indiana jones
[0:31] trying to find the ark of the covenant
[0:33] somewhere in the earth i'm talking about
[0:36] where is the ark of the covenant it's
[0:38] the throne of god and where is the
[0:41] throne of god today
[0:44] it's in the hearts of men
[0:46] this is the throne of god
[0:49] this is where god sits
[0:51] this is where god dwells he doesn't
[0:54] dwell in a building made with hands
[0:57] he's not looking for stained glass
[1:00] he's not looking for steeples
[1:04] because all of those things become a
[1:06] part of the babylonian system
[1:10] hallelujah so he's not dwelling in in
[1:12] tabernacles and temples built with the
[1:15] hands of men he's building himself he
[1:18] has builded himself a home
[1:21] in the hearts of men
[1:23] and women and he sits here on the ark of
[1:26] the covenant and and he represents to us
[1:29] both the written truth of god's word and
[1:32] the supernatural power that quickens the
[1:36] word and makes it alive i don't believe
[1:39] you can make the rapture with an
[1:41] intellectual concept of the word alone
[1:45] i believe you've got to have a
[1:47] revelation
[1:49] of the word because it's not the written
[1:51] word that's going to get us there it's
[1:54] the living word
[1:56] and the living word is the person of the
[1:58] lord jesus christ
[2:01] and he hasn't left himself unrepresented
[2:04] in the earth
[2:05] he's got a bride i wish i had some help
[2:08] he's got a bride hallelujah
[2:11] she is genderless
[2:13] [Music]
[2:16] she's raceless
[2:19] she is a race of her own
[2:22] [Music]
[2:24] amen doesn't matter if her skin is
[2:26] darker or lighter
[2:29] there's no race in the bride
[2:32] there's no gender in the bride
[2:35] but i want you to know in the bride it's
[2:37] genderless
[2:38] what god wants to do in you
[2:40] brothers
[2:42] as his bride he wants to do new sisters
[2:44] as his pride
[2:45] and if uh if a woman can be a son of god
[2:50] then a man can be a part of the bride of
[2:52] christ
[2:53] it's a paradigm
[2:55] [Music]
[2:57] and it's not two paradigms
[2:59] it's sonship and
[3:02] union that's the truth that's going to
[3:05] take us out of here to be one with
[3:08] christ the living word it's not how many
[3:11] quotes you memorize
[3:13] it's not how many scripture verses you
[3:15] memorize it's not how much of god's word
[3:17] you go through
[3:19] it's how much of god's word goes through
[3:21] you
[3:22] because digestive in the spiritual is re
[3:26] is revelation it's god getting down in
[3:29] there and making it quicken until listen
[3:32] you can preach all day long
[3:34] of what god wants to do
[3:37] but you let somebody get a revelation he
[3:39] wants to do that for me
[3:42] it changes the atmosphere
[3:44] [Music]
[3:46] we can talk all day long about having
[3:48] the power of the creative spoken word
[3:52] but once you get a revelation
[4:02] you
