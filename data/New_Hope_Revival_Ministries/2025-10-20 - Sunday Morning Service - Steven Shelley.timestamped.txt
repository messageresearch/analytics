[39:04] do hate that.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; It really bothers me to think somebody
[39:08] came all this way to get sick. But I
[39:10] hope and pray that it was for them like
[39:13] it has been for us. It was worth it was
[39:15] worth uh a week of no voice and it was
[39:19] to experience what we have experienced.
[39:21] But that won't carry us today,
[39:23] &gt;&gt; right?
[39:24] &gt;&gt; That was yesterday.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; Uh would you please pray for the family
[39:28] of brother Bobby Wartz? It's still not
[39:32] uh registering yet with me that he's
[39:35] gone
[39:36] two months after his diagnosis so
[39:38] quickly. He left us one by one. I was
[39:42] texting sister uh brother and sister
[39:44] Green's daughter Karen and said one by
[39:48] one they're leaving us
[39:49] &gt;&gt; and it gives us something to look
[39:51] forward to.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; I I believe there is a reunion.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, there is
[39:57] &gt;&gt; just over just over the next hill.
[40:00] in the morning.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; I just kept saying in the morning,
[40:03] Brother Bobby, we'll see you in the
[40:05] morning.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Would you pray for the family? They're
[40:07] doing well. God is giving them great
[40:09] strength. The community is surrounding
[40:12] them in a very precious way. There are
[40:14] people traveling from all over the
[40:16] country. Would you ask God to give them
[40:19] safety as they go? We have a van load le
[40:22] leaving here Tuesday night after service
[40:24] to to be there in time for the funeral.
[40:28] And uh my family is some of my family's
[40:31] on that van and then there's four of us
[40:33] flying out Wednesday morning to be
[40:35] there. We just want I want the Lord to
[40:38] go with us.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; It's a great honor to be asked to have a
[40:42] something to say in a song. But I want
[40:45] it there'll be business people there.
[40:47] There'll be community neighbors there.
[40:49] It won't just be believers. And I would
[40:52] so love that his going would be able to
[40:57] send a message through us.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; This is real. This is this isn't a
[41:01] hobby.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; This serving God is not a hobby.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; It's not.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; It's a lifestyle of preparation. Anyway,
[41:08] I don't want to preach now, but
[41:11] &gt;&gt; much to pray about. And then then we
[41:14] travel again next week.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; This one we're driving. And so we want
[41:18] the Lord and all those who will be going
[41:20] to the wedding
[41:21] &gt;&gt; and the services that will be held while
[41:23] we're there that God will move.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; Will you sing this chorus with us as
[41:29] we're getting ready to pray?
[41:31] You are awome
[41:35] in this place.
[41:45] You are awesome
[41:48] in this place.
[41:53] Father,
[41:58] you are worthy
[42:02] of all praise.
[42:06] To you our lives we raise.
[42:12] You are awome
[42:15] in this place.
[42:18] Mighty
[42:20] God. Sing again.
[42:24] Oh you are awome
[42:29] in this place.
[42:32] Mighty
[42:33] God,
[42:36] [Music]
[42:38] you are awome
[42:42] in this place
[42:45] of a father.
[42:52] You are worthy
[42:55] of all praise.
[43:00] To you our lives we raise.
[43:05] You are awome
[43:09] in this place.
[43:12] My sing once again. Brother Daniel, will
[43:15] you come and pray over the needs today?
[43:18] Oh, you are awome
[43:22] in this place.
[43:26] Mighty
[43:28] God,
[43:33] you are awome
[43:36] in this place
[43:40] of a father.
[43:46] You are worthy
[43:50] of all praise.
[43:54] To you our lives
[43:58] we raise.
[44:00] You are
[44:03] awesome in this place.
[44:07] Mighty
[44:09] God.
[44:11] Shall we approach him together? Oh
[44:13] precious Lord. Aba Father, the
[44:17] disciples, when you asked him, will you
[44:19] go also? After some had turned away,
[44:21] they said, to whom shall we go? We have
[44:24] nowhere else to go but to you today. And
[44:26] we're so thankful that you're a great
[44:28] awesome papa, that you care about our
[44:32] down sittings and our uprisings. You're
[44:34] mindful of everything that's going on,
[44:36] Lord, not just in our local body, but
[44:38] your body throughout the world. Lord,
[44:40] there's nothing that you miss. There's
[44:42] nothing that you don't know. So as we
[44:45] come before you this morning, Lord,
[44:47] we're just asking you to have your way
[44:50] in earth as it is in heaven. Lord, we
[44:53] surrender our will, our thoughts, our
[44:55] desires, and we're asking you to move,
[44:57] Lord. We ask you to do what you've done
[44:59] by your stripes, Lord, for Sister Annie
[45:02] this morning, Lord. And the other
[45:03] request for the sister who has a
[45:05] neighbor getting ready to give birth,
[45:06] Lord, touch her and move on that
[45:08] request, Lord Jesus. for every unspoken
[45:11] need upon the people's heart. Lord, we
[45:13] know that you can hear our hearts.
[45:16] There's nothing hidden from you. And
[45:18] Lord, if we would try today, if we would
[45:22] try to cover something or hide
[45:24] something, Lord, we would just ask that
[45:25] you would shine a light because we don't
[45:28] want anything, Lord, to follow us. We
[45:31] want everything to go before us. We want
[45:34] to be illuminated by your light, Lord.
[45:36] We want nothing that we would have to be
[45:38] embarrassed about or ashamed of. We know
[45:41] you're more than able. We know that your
[45:42] blood settled the debt. It settled the
[45:46] debt. We have been redeemed by your
[45:48] death on the cross
[45:49] &gt;&gt; and we've been healed by your stripes,
[45:51] Lord. And we believe we believe Isaiah
[45:54] saw it before it happened and we believe
[45:56] it came to pass. So we lay fast hold of
[46:00] the promise today.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; We're asking for traveling mercies for
[46:03] everyone this week, Lord. We're asking
[46:05] for a full recovery for brother Steven.
[46:07] We're asking Lord for the upcoming
[46:09] trips. Lord, just seems like so many
[46:11] things overlap and there's so much to
[46:13] do. But God, if you go and if you send
[46:16] the angels and if you stand, if you
[46:19] Lord, if you just do what you are
[46:22] capable of doing, Lord, it will be done
[46:24] so so well. So we surrender our thoughts
[46:27] and our will to you today. And we ask
[46:29] you have your way, master, once again in
[46:32] earth as it is in heaven. and we'll be
[46:34] careful to praise you for your great
[46:36] works as we pray in the name above all
[46:39] names, Yeshua Hamashiach, our Lord and
[46:42] Master Jesus Christ.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[46:49] Thank you, Jesus.
[46:51] Lord, I give you praise for your worthy.
[46:57] Hallelujah.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; You may have your seats today.
[47:03] Glory to
[47:09] &gt;&gt; camp meeting 2025 is now in the rear
[47:13] view mirror,
[47:15] but I am still living in his goodness.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; I am so grateful for his goodness in my
[47:23] life.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Well, brother, I've been sick. I'm still
[47:26] living in his goodness.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; I've had some loss. I'm still living in
[47:31] his goodness
[47:33] &gt;&gt; because that's who he is.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; He is good all of the time.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We'd like to welcome
[47:42] Gary and Donna Steel from Woodland,
[47:44] Alabama. They've been streaming our
[47:45] services and we welcome you here in the
[47:48] house of the Lord today. God bless you,
[47:53] Jessica. It's nice to see you today.
[47:56] Worked all night and still got your eyes
[47:59] open. We're glad to see you today. God
[48:01] bless you.
[48:04] Hope, we ain't scared you off. Jacob, we
[48:07] ain't scared you off. We're glad that
[48:09] you're here. God bless you.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; Solomon and Zion, God bless you. It's
[48:18] good to have you here in the house of
[48:19] the Lord with us today.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; The Lord be with you.
[48:25] Doris did a boomerang,
[48:28] came back with Matt to celebrate Caleb's
[48:32] birthday, and to dedicate some babies.
[48:36] We're glad that they're with us today.
[48:38] God bless you,
[48:40] [Applause]
[48:43] &gt;&gt; Logan. You about hid, but I see you back
[48:45] there. I'm glad you're here today. God
[48:48] bless you.
[48:50] [Applause]
[48:53] Brother Cade's going to move over to the
[48:55] piano and we're going to worship
[48:57] together with him as we're getting ready
[48:59] to hear the preaching of the word today.
[49:02] We've come we have come into the house
[49:04] of the Lord with a heart ready to
[49:07] receive. We've been asking the Lord to
[49:09] speak to us directly. Uh not shoveling
[49:12] it over our shoulder to someone else,
[49:14] but receiving from the Lord for ourself
[49:17] because we as a people are making
[49:20] ourselves ready for the uh for whatever
[49:24] the Lord has in our book. Uh we are
[49:28] making ourselves ready to let our
[49:30] destinies be fulfilled. every piece of
[49:33] it, not leaving one thing behind.
[49:36] Redeeming the time because the days are
[49:38] evil, things that the enemy would have
[49:41] tried to steal from us. We are letting
[49:44] our eyes behold them. And we are once
[49:47] again taking a hold of them. And we're
[49:49] saying, "They're mine. God promised it
[49:52] to me. I'm not letting loose of it. I
[49:54] may have let it slip once, but I'm
[49:57] reaching back and I'm grabbing a hold of
[49:59] it. and I am redeeming the time because
[50:02] that the days are evil.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; So, we're going to receive the tithe and
[50:06] offering as brother Cade is is singing.
[50:08] We're going to worship together with our
[50:11] giving and with our voices unto the
[50:13] Lord. Brother Ellas, would you come
[50:15] today? Brother Jonathan, will you help
[50:17] him, please? We let these two brothers
[50:19] come to you to so you can give of your
[50:22] tithe and offering unto the Lord. We're
[50:25] not giving it to man. We're not giving
[50:27] it to a ministry. We're giving it to
[50:28] him. That way we never have to look back
[50:31] and regret one dime of it because we're
[50:33] giving it to him. God bless you as we
[50:36] worship together.
[50:43] [Music]
[50:55] All I want held dear. Build my life
[51:01] upon.
[51:03] All this world reverses
[51:07] in wars to own. All I once thought gain.
[51:15] I have counted
[51:17] loss, spent worthless
[51:21] now
[51:23] compared
[51:25] to this.
[51:28] Knowing you,

[51:48] my joy, my righteousness.
[51:52] And I love you, Lord.
[51:58] Now my heart's desire
[52:02] is to know you more to be found in you
[52:10] and know
[52:12] as yours to possess by faith what I
[52:18] could not earn or surpassing
[52:24] gift of rightuous iousness
[52:31] knowing you
[52:34] Jesus
[52:36] knowing you
[52:39] there is no greater
[52:43] thing.
[52:46] You're my all. You're the best. You're
[52:50] my joy, my righteousness.
[52:54] And I love you, Lord.
[53:00] Oh, to know the power of your ris.

[53:22] Lord. So with you to live
[53:27] and never
[53:29] die.

[53:55] and I love you, Lord.

[54:08] life and to know you in your sufferings.

[54:58] and I love you, Lord.
[55:03] You're my all. You're the best. You're
[55:08] my joy, my righteousness,
[55:11] and I love you, Lord.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:23] Falling in love
[55:25] with Jesus.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Falling in love.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Falling in love
[55:33] with Jesus.
[55:35] [Music]
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Falling in love
[55:41] with Jesus.
[55:44] [Music]
[55:45] It was the best thing I've ever
[55:49] done.
[55:52] Falling in love.
[55:54] Falling in love with Jesus.
[56:01] Falling in love.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Falling in love with Jesus.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, falling in love
[56:13] with Jesus
[56:16] was the best thing I've ever
[56:20] done.
[56:22] In his arms,
[56:26] in his arms I feel protected.
[56:31] [Music]
[56:33] Oh, in his arms
[56:36] never disconnected.
[56:39] Oh,
[56:41] in his arms
[56:43] I feel
[56:45] protected.
[56:47] And there's no place I'd ra
[56:51] be
[56:52] &gt;&gt; in his arms. One more time.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[56:56] in his arms I feel
[57:01] protected. In his arms, in his arms,
[57:06] never disconnected.
[57:12] In his arms
[57:14] I feel
[57:16] protected
[57:18] cuz there's no place I'd ra
[57:22] be.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; There is no place I'd ra
[57:30] be.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[57:35] Let's just lift our hands to him right
[57:37] now.
[57:38] Just lift up your hands and tell him,
[57:40] "Lord, in your arms,
[57:44] &gt;&gt; in your right hand,
[57:48] &gt;&gt; in your right hand, Lord, there's no
[57:50] place I'd rather be
[57:52] sheltered beneath the everlasting arms
[57:56] of a living God."
[57:59] Bless the Lord.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. Bless the Lord. Why
[58:04] don't you clap your hands for the King
[58:06] of Kings,
[58:10] [Applause]
[58:12] worthy,
[58:15] worthy,
[58:19] worthy, worthy, worthy.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Isn't he worthy today?
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Whether we feel good, whether we don't,
[58:26] he's worthy. Just like Brother Gley was
[58:28] telling us. Let's thank God for these
[58:30] musicians.
[58:36] Praise the Lord. Sorry about that, R.J.
[58:39] When the singing was going on, I could
[58:41] only hear Cade and the piano. And now I
[58:45] can hear a lot more. But uh it it could
[58:47] be that he was drowning me out, you
[58:50] know, and trying to get me back for some
[58:53] of the things I pick on him about. Glad
[58:57] to be in the house of the Lord today.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I don't think we we didn't
[59:01] mention I don't think uh but it's all
[59:03] right isn't it for us to say that uh I'm
[59:06] assuming that that this is your dad
[59:08] Jessica. Is that right? And I don't know
[59:11] if I've ever met you or not but we have
[59:13] have we ever been in the same place but
[59:16] I'm very thankful that you all are here
[59:18] today.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; Very very thankful.
[59:22] And uh it means something to us that you
[59:25] would come and that you would be
[59:26] streaming. I think it means more to us
[59:28] that you were streaming and still
[59:30] decided to come.
[59:33] You knew more about us than we knew
[59:35] about you. But we're glad you're here
[59:37] today. Let's open our Bibles to John
[59:40] chapter 14. And we will uh read the word
[59:44] of God today and uh hear. It's our
[59:47] desire to hear what the Lord would say
[59:50] to us. And uh he's always talking and
[59:54] we're we're we're only sometimes
[59:56] listening.
[59:58] Uh let me say that again.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Uh he's always talking
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; and and we're just listening some of the
[1:00:06] time. May God give us grace uh to listen
[1:00:09] more because he has a lots to say.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; John 14 verse 15. We just read this, but
[1:00:16] I want to reread it. And I'm sorry, but
[1:00:19] I do have a lozenge in my mouth. My
[1:00:23] voice is stronger today, but it's just
[1:00:25] not quite all the way. But God is
[1:00:28] helping us. If you love me, this is
[1:00:31] Jesus red letter. If you love me, keep
[1:00:35] my commandments, and I will pray the
[1:00:39] Father, and he shall give you another
[1:00:44] comforter,
[1:00:46] that he may abide with you forever,
[1:00:51] even the Spirit of truth, whom the world
[1:00:56] cannot receive. Now, this is the truth.
[1:01:00] Only the sons of God, only those who are
[1:01:04] carrying a representation of his gene
[1:01:08] seed can even hear him.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; So if you're one of those who can hear
[1:01:13] him, while we ought to be the happiest
[1:01:16] people on the planet,
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; I'm glad I can hear him.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; And the spirit of truth whom the world
[1:01:23] cannot receive because it seeth him not.
[1:01:25] They're looking for someone they can
[1:01:27] see. Neither knoweth him. Brother Cade
[1:01:31] was singing about knowing him, but ye
[1:01:34] know him, for he dwelleth with you. The
[1:01:37] spirit of truth. The spirit of truth
[1:01:40] dwelleth with you in the body of Jesus.
[1:01:44] Amen.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; And shall be what?
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; In you.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; And shall be in you. And then verse 18,
[1:01:52] I will not leave you comfortless.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; I will come to you.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; It's it's a bit in code, isn't it? I
[1:02:04] will not leave you comfortless. I will
[1:02:07] come to you. The spirit of truth that is
[1:02:10] with you now is going to leave you in
[1:02:13] the form that you are accustomed to. But
[1:02:16] I'm not going to leave you here without
[1:02:18] a comforter
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; because I'm going to come to you a
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; and now not only to you but I'm going to
[1:02:25] come and express myself how in you
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; that that's the paraphrase and it's
[1:02:32] right yet a little while and the world
[1:02:35] seeth me no more but ye see me because I
[1:02:38] live ye shall
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; oh brother that's a big promise at that
[1:02:44] day ye shall know that I am in my father
[1:02:49] and ye in me and I in you.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Did you follow it all the way?
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; That I am in my father
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; and ye in me
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; and I in you. At that day
[1:03:06] at that day, the day that I leave and
[1:03:09] that spirit of truth that is in me falls
[1:03:13] down to live in you. That day you'll
[1:03:16] know. In that moment you'll know. This
[1:03:19] is the revelation. He that hath my
[1:03:22] commandments and keepeth them. He it is
[1:03:27] that loveth me. And he that loveth me
[1:03:29] shall be loved of my father and I will
[1:03:32] love him and will manifest myself to
[1:03:36] him.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Now we're going to let you be seated in
[1:03:39] a moment. But there there's a little
[1:03:41] something in those verses that greatly
[1:03:44] disturbs the nominal church because they
[1:03:48] build everything they do on the on this
[1:03:53] pretense that that God loves the father
[1:03:58] loves every person the same.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; This is what we hear.
[1:04:07] This is why a gospel of inclusion is
[1:04:10] becoming the most popular gospel.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; But this is not what Jesus said.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "My father loves those that
[1:04:18] keep my commandments."
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; So he loves the whole world. For God so
[1:04:24] loved the world that he gave his only
[1:04:26] begotten son. But it doesn't say
[1:04:29] anywhere in scripture that we are loved
[1:04:31] the same. And it doesn't have to say
[1:04:34] that. It's not important that we all
[1:04:36] have the same measure of love. But I
[1:04:39] will tell you, he loves those
[1:04:42] particularly who will keep his word.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; I'm just giving you what Jesus said.
[1:04:47] Now, sir,
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; we just read it. I believe,
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; he that keepeth, he that hath my
[1:04:52] commandments and keepeth them, he it is
[1:04:55] that loveth me, and he that loveth me
[1:04:58] shall be loved of my father, and I will
[1:05:01] love him and manifest myself to him.
[1:05:03] Lord, we thank you today for strength
[1:05:06] and health and the blessing of being in
[1:05:10] your house.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; And we want to glorify you in all of
[1:05:15] your ways. For they are perfect
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; and your word is perfect in us. Perfect.
[1:05:23] And we want to thank you for the full
[1:05:25] manifestation of that word. We ask right
[1:05:28] now that you would not only anoint the
[1:05:31] delivery, but that you would anoint the
[1:05:33] reception. May our ears be anointed to
[1:05:37] hear your word and may it click.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; We hear this expression uh it somehow it
[1:05:43] just clicked with me. Lord, let it be so
[1:05:46] today that your word finds a place of
[1:05:50] clicking in and locking in so that we
[1:05:53] will never uh be able to deny it again
[1:05:56] but build our strength upon it. And we
[1:05:59] ask for this in the mighty name of the
[1:06:01] Lord Jesus Christ. And the church said,
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Please enjoy your seats.
[1:06:12] We have already been talking about the
[1:06:16] fact that the anointing is a person.
[1:06:20] It's not a feeling.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; It's a person. It is the manifest
[1:06:25] presence of God. It's the presence of
[1:06:28] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. So the
[1:06:31] the anointing is not how you feel. It's
[1:06:34] not the hair standing up on your arms or
[1:06:37] some tingle up your spine or or
[1:06:41] something that makes you want to dance.
[1:06:43] That's not that's not how we need to see
[1:06:46] the anointing as a feeling or as an
[1:06:49] emotion, something that you can step
[1:06:52] into and out of and feel one service and
[1:06:55] not feel the next service. We have sort
[1:06:58] of created that with a Pentecostal
[1:07:01] theology. Oh, I feel him. I really feel
[1:07:04] him. I I love to feel Listen, I'm not
[1:07:07] against feeling.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Wow. We need some feeling.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; And we need to feel him. But But the
[1:07:14] reality is whether we feel him or not,
[1:07:17] he's here.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm inside of you now. I'm
[1:07:22] going to come and live in you. And
[1:07:24] whether you witness or feel or uh have
[1:07:27] some sensation uh or not, I'm still
[1:07:30] there. I haven't left you. I'll never
[1:07:32] leave you. I'll never forsake you. I'll
[1:07:35] be with you even until the end. Isn't
[1:07:38] that what he said?
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; So, we need to begin to think more about
[1:07:43] the anointing as a manifestation
[1:07:47] uh of a person, the the person only one,
[1:07:51] the spirit of God that was once
[1:07:54] manifested in the fleshly body of the
[1:07:57] Lord Jesus Christ. Now, today he is
[1:08:01] manifested in all of our bodies if we
[1:08:05] have received the baptism of the Holy
[1:08:07] Ghost.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; And if you have not received the
[1:08:10] baptism, uh you should. It's it's a free
[1:08:14] gift. You don't have to get good enough
[1:08:17] to receive him.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; In fact, he will come if you are
[1:08:22] willing. If you surrender, he will come.
[1:08:25] And when he gets there, he'll help do
[1:08:27] the house cleaning.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; When the spirit of truth has come, he'll
[1:08:32] start cleaning things out.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; I've been in Pentecost long enough to
[1:08:38] remember that they used to have a bucket
[1:08:40] and a sponge, not too far from the
[1:08:44] altar.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; I I'm just being honest.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; I grew up like that. And And if you
[1:08:51] know, you no one was turned away.
[1:08:55] You know, it didn't matter whether they
[1:08:57] had spiders on their eyelids or not.
[1:09:00] They weren't turned away. But but it was
[1:09:03] an amazing thing because as soon as they
[1:09:06] prayed through
[1:09:16] spirit of truth. Listen, when the spirit
[1:09:18] of truth has come,
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; I was in Tanzania. It I'd been all over
[1:09:23] Africa. I was in Tanzania and I saw the
[1:09:27] first topless people, topless women
[1:09:30] walking up and down the busy streets of
[1:09:33] Dar Salam. And it was it was a bit of a
[1:09:37] shock because I had been all over Africa
[1:09:40] and everyone else had somehow figured a
[1:09:42] way to cover up. But these women were
[1:09:44] not vile women. They were mothers. They
[1:09:46] were grandmothers. They weren't trying
[1:09:48] to be uh you know particularly
[1:09:51] promiscuous. It it was just it was it
[1:09:54] was just hot and it was their culture.
[1:09:57] And one came to the service like that.
[1:10:00] And uh I I just you know uh wonder what
[1:10:03] the brothers would do. But they just
[1:10:05] went took a extra wrap off of one of the
[1:10:08] granny's. She had more than she needed.
[1:10:11] And they just asked her, "Would you
[1:10:13] mind?" They didn't they didn't cast it
[1:10:15] on her or or try to mistreat her. They
[1:10:18] just asked her, "Would you would you uh
[1:10:20] be willing to if you if you come in,
[1:10:23] we'd like for you to cover up." Well,
[1:10:25] she took it quite well. And she covered
[1:10:27] up and she tied it on. And in the
[1:10:30] process of that service, the spirit of
[1:10:32] the Lord fell
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; and right down on her face she went. And
[1:10:38] uh in fact, there was a great
[1:10:40] deliverance that took place in her life.
[1:10:43] Demons were cast out. And I think I know
[1:10:45] there's a photo down at the fellowship
[1:10:47] hall on the photo wall uh of that
[1:10:50] service. And I didn't look to see if
[1:10:52] that woman's picture is there. But when
[1:10:55] she got up, she had wept. She had cried.
[1:10:59] She had emptied herself. Demons had gone
[1:11:02] out of her life. And uh the the uh as
[1:11:07] she started to leave, she she took that
[1:11:10] cloak and she was she was trying to
[1:11:12] figure out how she was going to give it
[1:11:14] back to Granny and still be clothed
[1:11:17] herself.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; And so, uh Granny said, "Oh, you you
[1:11:22] keep it. You keep it." And that that
[1:11:26] woman was so thrilled and so blessed
[1:11:29] that she didn't have to take that off
[1:11:31] anymore because the Lord had changed her
[1:11:34] heart.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; No one taught her
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; the spirit of God. When the spirit of
[1:11:42] truth has come,
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; the spirit of God, if you're filled with
[1:11:46] a real genuine Holy Ghost, he he'll tell
[1:11:49] you you don't want to be fake.
[1:11:51] Right?
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; You don't want to look phony.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; You want to be real. Somebody said,
[1:11:58] "Well, it doesn't really matter." It
[1:11:59] matters
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; because the spirit of truth says that it
[1:12:04] matters.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; We have the blessing of not just walking
[1:12:07] along with him anymore, but he now lives
[1:12:10] inside of us.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; But there is something greater.
[1:12:15] There is a greater fellowship that is
[1:12:18] available to you and I than just having
[1:12:22] him living inside of us.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; There is a corporate
[1:12:27] manifestation or a corporate
[1:12:30] administration
[1:12:32] of the spirit of truth that lives inside
[1:12:34] of us. I believe we may have read this
[1:12:37] on Tuesday evening, but would you go to
[1:12:40] Numbers 11
[1:12:43] and uh verse 24 and 25? And Moses went
[1:12:48] out and told the people the words of the
[1:12:52] Lord and gathered the 70 men of the
[1:12:56] elders of the people and set them round
[1:13:01] about the tabernacle.
[1:13:03] And the Lord came down in a cloud and
[1:13:08] spake unto him and took of the spirit
[1:13:14] that was upon him. Who is the himymn
[1:13:17] here? Moses. And gave it
[1:13:22] what does it say?
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Unto the 70 elders.
[1:13:27] So the word of the Lord came down in a
[1:13:30] cloud and God reached into Moses and
[1:13:34] took a portion of an abiding presence
[1:13:39] uh that lived in Moses.
[1:13:42] He was a forerunner
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; and that anointing was living in him in
[1:13:47] a manifest way. God said, "I'm going to
[1:13:50] take that and I'm going to divide that
[1:13:53] spirit that was on Mo." Did Moses lose
[1:13:56] it?
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; No. No. Moses still had it.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; But God just reached down into Moses and
[1:14:03] he said, "I'm going to take 70 portions
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; of this anointing that's in the life of
[1:14:10] the leader and I'm going to divide that
[1:14:13] up among the elders." And what Moses was
[1:14:16] able to accomplish with wisdom and
[1:14:19] administration, leadership and
[1:14:21] government, I'm now going to have that
[1:14:24] same anointing,
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; same authority,
[1:14:28] same administration.
[1:14:31] It's now going to fall on 70 men
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; and they're going to make it an easier
[1:14:36] task
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; instead of one man trying to do it all.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; The example is set.
[1:14:45] 70 men
[1:14:47] anointed with the same spirit
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; that was upon Moses.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Now you may be one who thinks of a of
[1:14:56] someone's personal spirit as a
[1:14:58] personality
[1:15:00] a and uh you know we used to say I just
[1:15:03] feel a little disturbance in my spirit
[1:15:06] we would say or or I'm a little troubled
[1:15:09] in my spirit. Uh it's all right to say
[1:15:12] that but uh I pray it's not true. I pray
[1:15:16] that if there's a disturbance it's in
[1:15:18] the mind and the will and the emotion
[1:15:21] realm of who you are because if your
[1:15:24] spirit that inner of the inner if that
[1:15:26] is disturbed it's missing something
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; because that is to be the the
[1:15:32] resurrected life.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; The the seed that has to die before the
[1:15:39] life can be released. The life has been
[1:15:42] released on that fallen spirit and now
[1:15:45] it is a regenerated, resurrected and
[1:15:47] renewed spirit just as if it was coming
[1:15:51] again out of the mouth.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; It's breath.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; It's ruach. It's life. And just as if it
[1:15:59] were coming out of his mouth aresh a
[1:16:01] new. Uh this is what happens to us when
[1:16:04] we have a born again experience. It's a
[1:16:06] re it's a regeneration. Say the word
[1:16:09] with me. regeneration. It's not a
[1:16:12] replacement.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; There's no replacement.
[1:16:16] It's it's a resurrection.
[1:16:19] Can we call it a new spirit? We can
[1:16:22] because it's been infused with new life,
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; but it's not replacing the old. It's
[1:16:28] killing the old
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; and resurrecting what should have been
[1:16:32] there before the fall.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Do you do you understand that? So don't
[1:16:37] think of your spirit as your nature or
[1:16:40] your personality or you might say she
[1:16:43] has a quiet spirit. He has a boisterous
[1:16:46] spirit. They have an argumentative
[1:16:49] spirit. That's not what we're talking
[1:16:51] about here. It was not God taking a
[1:16:54] portion of the personality of Moses and
[1:16:58] dividing it among the people
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; because then you've got one genuine and
[1:17:03] 70 imitations. Yes, sir.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; 70 impersonations
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; of one Moses.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; So, this wasn't God making 70 William
[1:17:16] Brandoms.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; It wasn't God making 70 Moses. It was
[1:17:22] God taking that deposit of himself that
[1:17:26] was abiding in Moses and dividing it
[1:17:30] upon a corporate body.
[1:17:33] And that's as far as it went,
[1:17:36] 70.
[1:17:37] And then we go over to Acts chapter 2
[1:17:41] and we have another installment of a
[1:17:44] release of a corporate anointing. Follow
[1:17:48] me now.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; I think you'll want to know this in in a
[1:17:51] bit. You'll want to have this fresh in
[1:17:54] your mind in just a few moments. Now on
[1:17:57] that day, the Bible tells us that there
[1:18:00] were 120 men who were gathered in the
[1:18:04] upper room. And that great pillar of
[1:18:08] fire that led Moses and the children of
[1:18:11] Israel through the wilderness, it showed
[1:18:15] up under this new dispens
[1:18:18] under the new covenant, the new
[1:18:20] testament. It shows up on on the feast
[1:18:24] of Shàuote and it fills the room. This
[1:18:28] this manifest anointing.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; You you remember that brother Brandham
[1:18:35] taught us that the pillar of fire is the
[1:18:39] same as the spirit of truth.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; It's the same as the anointing.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; It is a manifestation of the same
[1:18:49] spirit. All the same the cloud a
[1:18:53] manifestation of the same spirit
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; the same same anointing
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; same spirit.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; So the pillar of fire now divided itself
[1:19:06] and and there was a rushing mighty wind.
[1:19:10] A sound filled the room as the as the
[1:19:13] ruach of the Lord come rushing in. And
[1:19:18] no doubt it was swirling above their
[1:19:20] heads. And and the Bible said that it
[1:19:23] appeared as cloven tongues of fire
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; like this,
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; licks of fire, tongues of fire upon each
[1:19:36] of them.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; That's big.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; I know you know that, but that's big
[1:19:43] business.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Same fire that divided the
[1:19:49] Red Sea. Same fire that led them all the
[1:19:52] way through.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; The same the very one and the same
[1:19:57] showed up in the New Testament. But now
[1:20:00] he said, "I'm going to divide myself
[1:20:04] upon all who are here."
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; And the Bible tells us there were 120.
[1:20:09] That's beautiful, isn't it?
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; It's already a higher level. How many
[1:20:14] got that portion under the ministry of
[1:20:16] Moses? 70. And and and and how many
[1:20:20] initially got that portion and then it
[1:20:23] stopped. 70 was the end. Period. I know
[1:20:25] I'm restating for a purpose. Period.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; It didn't keep moving.
[1:20:33] 70 men leading, judging, hearing all the
[1:20:38] crud
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; and having to decide what to do about
[1:20:41] it. calming all the nerves, settling all
[1:20:45] the arguments.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; 70 men doing it.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; And nobody had to say, "Oh, I don't like
[1:20:52] what you said. I don't like what I I
[1:20:54] wanted Moses. I come for Moses."
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Nobody had to do that because they were
[1:20:59] able to recognize that the same spirit
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; that was on Moses now rested on 70 other
[1:21:06] men.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; I hope you hear this. That's right.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; It has never been God's design from the
[1:21:13] beginning to put all that he was in one
[1:21:16] man only.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; He's always been looking for a house to
[1:21:21] live in.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; And if you know anything about him, you
[1:21:24] know that he likes a house with lots of
[1:21:26] rooms.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; He likes a lot of places to stretch out
[1:21:29] and dwell.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; What house will you build me? I'm
[1:21:33] looking for a place to live. This is
[1:21:35] what his message is to us. I'm looking
[1:21:38] for not not a place to visit,
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; a place to inhabit,
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; not a place to show up on Sunday
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; and you not feel my presence or know me
[1:21:51] until Tuesday.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. I want to be with you. I
[1:21:56] really want to be in you and I don't
[1:21:58] ever want to leave you once I occupy.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; We're talking about not an incarnation.
[1:22:07] We've already had an incarnation. We're
[1:22:10] talking about a corporate habitation.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; We're talking about that same anointing,
[1:22:16] that same person of Jesus Christ, his
[1:22:20] character, his attributes, his power,
[1:22:24] his authority,
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; dividing itself. First, 70 men. Period.
[1:22:31] The spirit of leadership, the spirit of
[1:22:34] administration that was on Moses, the
[1:22:36] spirit of wisdom
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; as we read in Isaiah, the the sevenfold
[1:22:42] spirit of God. Oh, the spirit of wisdom,
[1:22:45] this beautiful uh the reverential fear,
[1:22:48] all these beautiful things that are
[1:22:50] found in the one spirit.
[1:22:53] And Moses got them. He got the deposit.
[1:22:56] He hit the jackpot.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; But it was more than he could handle.
[1:23:00] There were too many people with too many
[1:23:02] problems.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; So God said, "I'm going to," it was
[1:23:04] always his plan.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; He just wanted to wear Moses a little
[1:23:08] thin
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; to show people the beauty. Hallelujah.
[1:23:12] The beauty of God not living in a pastor
[1:23:15] only
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; or God not living in a prophet only
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; or a teacher only or or a grandma only.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; But the beauty of what it's like when
[1:23:26] every believer can come all the way
[1:23:29] through
[1:23:30] Pass the earnest of the Holy Spirit to
[1:23:33] the full occupation.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Fully occupied.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Are you driving a point? I'm driving.
[1:23:42] I'm going to drive. I'm going to pound
[1:23:44] the point
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; because I want you to understand that
[1:23:48] this in us is to produce something
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; earthshattering.
[1:23:55] It it produced something in the time of
[1:23:58] Jesus that that the Bible tells us that
[1:24:01] it was being told all over the known
[1:24:04] world that these are the men who turned
[1:24:07] the world upside down
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; who turned the world upside down.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Caused every religion, every
[1:24:15] false worship had to take note that God
[1:24:19] was now living
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; in a corporate people.
[1:24:24] That's right.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Not many gods.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Nope. That's right.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; They They knew what it was like to have
[1:24:30] many gods. The Greeks knew. The Romans
[1:24:34] knew. The pagans knew what it was like
[1:24:37] to have many deities, but they didn't
[1:24:39] know what it was. This concept of one
[1:24:43] mighty God,
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; only one now dividing himself to live in
[1:24:49] many bodies.
[1:24:51] and they're just scratching their head
[1:24:54] and they said, "These are those men."
[1:24:56] Hallelujah.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; These are those men who turn the world
[1:24:59] upside down.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; That means they disturb the devil's
[1:25:04] business.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; They wreap havoc on the works of
[1:25:09] darkness in their day.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; So much so that they set that little
[1:25:13] witch free, that little girl who was uh
[1:25:16] sold into into witchcraft. And uh oh my
[1:25:21] she was uh making money for her pimps
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; with her spells.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Woo. And they lo she she found a new
[1:25:32] life and they lost their source of
[1:25:35] income.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; No wonder they said the world was turned
[1:25:38] upside down.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; It changed taxation. It changed
[1:25:42] everything
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; that there was a corporate Messiah.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Preach. Oh. Oh. I I'm giving away the
[1:25:51] punch.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; That's all right.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Line. Oh, punch line.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Not punch. That's not nice. Punch line.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; I'm giving that away by telling you that
[1:26:04] now there was a corporate Messiah
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; on the earth.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; A many membered Messiah. Amen.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; What does Messiah mean?
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Anointed one.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; What does Messiah mean?
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; There was a corporate Messiah on the
[1:26:27] scene.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; A many membered Messiah.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; The Messiah now living in many houses.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; This was God's plan.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; He foreshadowed it in the ministry of
[1:26:39] Moses.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? He demonstrated it in
[1:26:43] shàuote Pentecost, the day of Pentecost.
[1:26:47] He demonstrated it and now instead of
[1:26:49] stopping at 70, it went to 120 and by
[1:26:53] the end of the day it was already 3,000.
[1:26:56] [Applause]
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; This revival that started in the upper
[1:27:02] room, it spilled out because you can't
[1:27:05] keep 120 drunk men in a room for very
[1:27:08] long.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody got to go.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Do you get it? Yes, sir.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Somebody's coming out of there
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; and they're stumbling down the steps and
[1:27:20] gathered in Jerusalem. Oh my. Uh, think
[1:27:24] about this concept. They've come from
[1:27:27] the east. They've come from the west.
[1:27:30] They've come from the north and the
[1:27:32] south
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; to dine with the king,
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; to feast as his guest. How blessed these
[1:27:43] pilgrims are
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; beholding his hallowed face
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; with a glow with light divine blessed
[1:27:54] partakers of his grace as jewels in his
[1:27:59] crown
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; to shine.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; It didn't start a generation ago.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; It started in a Moses installment.
[1:28:08] It it it increased in a New Testament
[1:28:13] demonstration
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; where 120 quickly became 3,000 that
[1:28:17] quickly became 5,000 that quickly became
[1:28:20] 7,000
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; that quickly became 12,000.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; How many messiahs were there? One.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; One one one Messiah
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; one anointed one.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; But now he has divided himself.
[1:28:40] So if you ran into one of those 120,
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; what would you be meeting on the street?
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; You'd be meeting a portion
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; of the Messiah.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; It's a corporate body. Now
[1:29:01] you see the corner is turning
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; and they're doing today what they did
[1:29:08] way back when.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; They're refusing to to discern the
[1:29:15] change of the rhythm.
[1:29:19] God has a rhythm.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; He's a divine bandmaster.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; He has a rhythm. Everything God does has
[1:29:28] a rhythm. What do you mean by that? I
[1:29:30] mean he moves in cycles. He moves in
[1:29:32] seasons. He moves in ages. He moves in
[1:29:35] dispensations.
[1:29:37] But he's not all over the place.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; He's not chaotic.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; It's not as though he's making up a plan
[1:29:44] as he goes.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; Anybody with me on that?
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; He knows.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; He knows exactly what he's doing. And
[1:29:51] he's been planning to do this from the
[1:29:53] beginning. I'm looking for a way to get
[1:29:56] who I am in as many people as I possibly
[1:29:59] can for a final showdown.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:07] You see Mount Carmel, there's another
[1:30:10] showdown
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; prophesied
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; in similitude to uh the Mount Carmel
[1:30:19] showdown, but it moves into another
[1:30:22] installment in the very last of the last
[1:30:24] and it becomes a showdown on Mount Zion.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I don't have a clue what
[1:30:31] that means." Well, you won't until you
[1:30:33] begin to search the scripture and
[1:30:35] understand that Zion is not just a city
[1:30:38] or a hill
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; or a portion of Jerusalem, but Zion is
[1:30:42] actually an overcoming company of
[1:30:44] people.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Lift up your head, oh you gates.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; Because you're the part that's going to
[1:30:51] welcome the King of glory.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; The King of glory wants to come in his
[1:30:55] people,
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; and he wants to come in in a way that is
[1:30:58] magnified.
[1:31:00] Just a moment. Magnified from the Moses
[1:31:03] administration.
[1:31:05] Magnified from the day of Pentecost
[1:31:08] administration. He wants to come in and
[1:31:11] fully occupy. Hallelujah.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; It's like Tommy Osbborne
[1:31:18] who went to India
[1:31:20] uh he and Daisy and they labored in the
[1:31:24] uh among the Hindus and uh wasn't maybe
[1:31:29] as many Muslims there as there are now
[1:31:32] but but the Hindus
[1:31:35] and these these men uh and women they
[1:31:39] are high level they deal in high level
[1:31:42] witchcraft
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; and the people marvel. They don't
[1:31:46] believe you. They think it had to be a
[1:31:48] gimmick or a trick. But when I was at
[1:31:50] Chennai for brother Sadu, uh taping
[1:31:54] television programs for Angel TV, uh I
[1:31:57] had so many supernatural exper from the
[1:32:00] from the first night I landed in India
[1:32:02] to the night I left. I had so many
[1:32:04] supernatural experiences that I couldn't
[1:32:06] hardly keep up with them because there
[1:32:08] was so much of the darkness that was
[1:32:10] emerging over the land that God said the
[1:32:13] only way for me to keep my people whole
[1:32:15] and clean is I'm going to have to I'm
[1:32:17] going to have to pour out my spirit on
[1:32:19] them. I'm going to have to just do
[1:32:21] something for them to keep them from
[1:32:23] being distracted by what the enemy's
[1:32:25] doing in the land. And so I had multiple
[1:32:28] experiences that were tangible and real
[1:32:31] before the Lord. But I stood one day and
[1:32:33] looked out my window and I saw a man
[1:32:35] levitating across the street. And there
[1:32:37] were no strings and there were no tricks
[1:32:40] and there were no hidden poles in his
[1:32:42] pants legs. All the things that
[1:32:45] charlatans may have done through the
[1:32:46] years to try to pretend like they were
[1:32:49] levitating. But this was nothing but the
[1:32:52] very uh works of witchcraft and
[1:32:55] darkness.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; How do you know? Because I had a little
[1:33:00] fun.
[1:33:02] That's how I know.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; You see, where you are should be a
[1:33:05] no-fly zone.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; If anybody's going to fly in my my zone,
[1:33:12] it's going to be me.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; You're going to land.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; And you're not coming down on a pillow,
[1:33:20] buddy.
[1:33:22] You're going to come down in such a
[1:33:23] manner that you're going to look around
[1:33:25] and try to discover who it is that put
[1:33:27] you on your hind end
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; on the street corner in Chennai because
[1:33:31] there's a God.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; There's a God that's bigger. Do you
[1:33:35] believe that? There's a God bigger than
[1:33:36] any Hindu shaman.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Bigger than any witchcraft. Bigger. He's
[1:33:42] powerful. He is above it all. Behold, I
[1:33:45] give unto you power
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; to tread upon serpents and scorpions.
[1:33:51] And if you drink any deadly thing, it
[1:33:54] shall not harm you.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; We need some of that. We don't need it
[1:34:01] anymore. Just in India and Vanuatu and
[1:34:03] places like that where the witch doctors
[1:34:06] in Vanuatu separate their heads from
[1:34:08] their bodies and put them on shelves and
[1:34:10] people come to see it. And someone said,
[1:34:12] "I don't believe that." I guess you
[1:34:14] don't believe that there are people in
[1:34:16] the in the western part of Africa that
[1:34:19] walk into the ocean either, do you? And
[1:34:21] live
[1:34:22] I guess you don't believe that there are
[1:34:24] people who have been have become so
[1:34:26] adapted to living underwater by the
[1:34:29] occupation of demon forces that they do
[1:34:32] their they live their whole life under
[1:34:34] there. And the only reason why they come
[1:34:36] out is is to to make the power of their
[1:34:40] demons known and to show people this is
[1:34:43] very well documented. And you know what?
[1:34:46] At the end of the day, you probably
[1:34:48] think it matters to me whether you
[1:34:50] believe my story or not. You'd be
[1:34:53] surprised how little it matters.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, you're just being
[1:34:56] rude." No, I'm telling you like it is.
[1:34:58] Because you live a little sheltered life
[1:35:00] in a one-horse town in Alabama doesn't
[1:35:02] mean and and it's not happening where
[1:35:04] you can see it
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; doesn't mean that it's not happening in
[1:35:08] other places.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; It's been prophesied for over 70 years
[1:35:12] that the that the works of darkness that
[1:35:15] have at one season or another they have
[1:35:19] been uh limited to other parts of the
[1:35:22] world. It was has been prophesied for
[1:35:25] over 70 years that what has been seen in
[1:35:27] the darkest jungles of Africa will show
[1:35:30] up on the continent of North America.
[1:35:33] And the church
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; the church is ill equipped
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; to be able to deal with it.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; That's why there's going to have to be a
[1:35:43] corporate messiah.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; There's going to have to be a people
[1:35:48] that have already been through the fire.
[1:35:52] Come on.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; There's going to have to be a people
[1:35:55] who've already been through the fire.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; That work of darkness and the different
[1:36:00] administrations while they do surgeries
[1:36:03] without without any form of anesthesia.
[1:36:07] They remove body parts without without
[1:36:10] surgical scalpels.
[1:36:15] They plant fetishes in in in bodies of
[1:36:19] those they want to occupy like needles
[1:36:22] in their eyeballs.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I can't believe in such
[1:36:26] a thing as that." Doesn't matter whether
[1:36:27] you believe in it or not.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; I have friends that have dealt really
[1:36:33] heavy into that kind of of deliverance.
[1:36:35] And I'm going to tell you something.
[1:36:37] There's nothing attractive about it to
[1:36:39] me. Amen.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; I've been riding along with them through
[1:36:43] the north California country and and
[1:36:47] these uh folks I don't want to say their
[1:36:49] name but these folks who have dealt with
[1:36:52] they didn't have a choice because Anton
[1:36:54] Lee's daughter showed up at their church
[1:36:58] and uh this was many years ago and if
[1:37:01] you don't know he was the author of the
[1:37:03] Satanic Bible and worse than that he was
[1:37:06] leading uh all the different groups of
[1:37:08] Satanist at one time not around the
[1:37:11] world but in America.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; And uh there were all kinds of filthy
[1:37:15] things that were taking place. And uh
[1:37:18] I've been riding along with them when
[1:37:19] they started talking about these things.
[1:37:21] And the and the automobile began to uh
[1:37:25] witness
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; by by uh unlocking and locking and
[1:37:31] unlocking and locking and locking and
[1:37:33] unlocking as you're driving through a
[1:37:35] particular place. So somebody said, "I
[1:37:38] don't know about all of that." You ought
[1:37:40] to you ought to at least know
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; that it's there.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; May it never bother you. I pray you
[1:37:47] never have to deal with anything on that
[1:37:50] level. But I will tell you that if you
[1:37:53] are not very careful, you'll open the
[1:37:55] door of your life.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; By what you let in the eye gate
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; because Hollywood is about 15 somewhere
[1:38:09] between 15 and 20 years ahead of the
[1:38:11] nominal church.
[1:38:14] They're they're tapping in
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; to something that the church is so far
[1:38:19] behind in
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; and they use that they put that on
[1:38:23] display because they want people to uh
[1:38:27] to uh want it, to crave it, to desire
[1:38:29] it.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; And so they start looking for where they
[1:38:32] can find it. And they're giving pieces
[1:38:35] of their life away so that they can gain
[1:38:37] more power. Somebody said, "I certainly
[1:38:39] didn't come to the house of God to hear
[1:38:40] about the works of darkness." Well, uh,
[1:38:42] I'm sorry, but we don't need to be
[1:38:44] ignorant of his devices either. But what
[1:38:47] we need to know is that there is a
[1:38:49] corporate Messiah
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; who's forming in the land.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Not just 70,
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; not just 120 that eventually multiplied
[1:39:01] to several thousand, but something
[1:39:03] actually much much greater than that.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Not necessarily in number. Amen.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; But in potency
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; because he's been after a people
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; since Pentecost.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; For 2,000 years. He's been looking for a
[1:39:27] people that he could occupy
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; in the last days. And this is something
[1:39:33] that we want to grab a hold of because
[1:39:36] if there is such a thing, you don't have
[1:39:38] to believe it yet, but if there is such
[1:39:40] a thing, I want it. I want to be in
[1:39:42] that.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; I want to be a part of that.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; So, Galatians 1, I want you to know Paul
[1:39:49] understood it
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; as the first church age messenger. Let's
[1:39:52] move quickly. Galatians 1:15-16.
[1:39:55] But when it pleased God, who separated
[1:39:58] me from my mother's womb and called me
[1:40:02] by his grace, why? Why? Why, Paul? Why,
[1:40:06] Shaul? Why were you separated from your
[1:40:10] mother? Why were you called by his grace
[1:40:13] uh as it pleased God? Someone tell me
[1:40:16] why.
[1:40:19] Paul's testimony is that his creator
[1:40:22] wanted to reveal his son
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; to me
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; in me.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; In me
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; that I might preach him among the
[1:40:35] heathen.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; Did Did Paul need for the son to be
[1:40:41] revealed in him in order to preach him
[1:40:46] among the heathen? Yes or no?
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Yes. Because just to know about him will
[1:40:54] as as one of the ministers mentioned,
[1:40:57] just knowing about him can leave you
[1:40:59] stripped naked,
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; beat up and running through the street
[1:41:04] because those demons rose up and said,
[1:41:06] "Paul, I know and and this one I know,
[1:41:09] but
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; what truck did you fall off of?"
[1:41:16] because we don't sense any power
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; because they were trying to do it in a
[1:41:23] proxy form.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; I adure you by the name of the God that
[1:41:28] Paul preached about
[1:41:30] you. You see that's church.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; That's like a creed.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; The devils, they don't fear that.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; They don't fear organized religion. No
[1:41:43] sir,
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; we can get this over if you'll help me.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; They don't fear that. They fear somebody
[1:41:49] who has been occupied
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; by the God that Paul preached.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Then you don't even have to introduce
[1:41:57] yourself. That's
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; right. A
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; and you don't have to say, "I'm coming
[1:42:01] to you today uh in the name of the one
[1:42:05] that uh they were talking about the
[1:42:08] other day in the marketplace."
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. You just come in his name.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. A and you just say, "You foul
[1:42:14] demon of hell.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; I command you to bow to the authority of
[1:42:18] Jesus Christ. Go. Go." You see, Jesus
[1:42:21] had a ministry model that doesn't look
[1:42:23] anything like charismatic chaos today.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; He didn't interview them. He didn't ask
[1:42:27] them how long they'd had the demon. He
[1:42:29] didn't ask them uh how many Ouija boards
[1:42:32] they played with, how many horseshoes
[1:42:34] they hung over the door, how many lucky
[1:42:36] rabbits foots they carried foot feet,
[1:42:39] whatever. How how they they
[1:42:42] He didn't ask him anything like that.
[1:42:44] When when Jesus was confronted with the
[1:42:47] possessed,
[1:42:49] his ministry model was not let me find
[1:42:52] out its name, how long it's been, all
[1:42:54] the detail. I need details. I need
[1:42:56] details. I need detail. Inquiring minds
[1:42:59] want to know and I need details. No, no,
[1:43:01] no,
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; no. He didn't do any of that. Didn't
[1:43:03] matter. Didn't matter its name. Well, he
[1:43:06] asked uh at at one occasion, but most of
[1:43:10] the time it didn't matter how long you
[1:43:11] been, how many are you? The these were
[1:43:13] just occasional things that were uh for
[1:43:17] our for our learning. They're there for
[1:43:20] us. But his his main ministry model for
[1:43:23] dealing with the demon possessed was go.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; The scripture says literally Jesus said
[1:43:28] go.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; See, it wasn't the word. It was the
[1:43:35] authority.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; He could have said hocus pocus.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; He could have said little boy blue.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; He could have said little Miss Muffet.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; It wasn't words.
[1:43:51] It was the authority of the word
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; that he was.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that?
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; So it's not always knowing the right
[1:43:59] thing to say to the devil. Sometime it's
[1:44:02] just having the life,
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; the authority
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; of the one that he fears the most
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; living in you as a part of the corporate
[1:44:10] Messiah and he has to flee.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; I'm not done.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; So, you're going to need to come on up
[1:44:16] with us here for just a moment to reveal
[1:44:18] his son in me that I might preach him
[1:44:21] among the heathen immediately. I
[1:44:23] conferred not with flesh and blood. I I
[1:44:26] I didn't get what I got from a teacher.
[1:44:28] I didn't get what I got from my mama or
[1:44:30] my daddy. I didn't get what I got from
[1:44:32] the church house. Uh but something came
[1:44:35] on me. His son was not revealed to me.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; He was revealed where
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; does it matter?
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; Does that tiny little preposition
[1:44:46] matter?
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Certainly does. And it's going to matter
[1:44:49] for you, too. Let's see what else uh the
[1:44:52] apostle said in the book of Galatians
[1:44:53] that that was written to the church in
[1:44:56] Galatia chapter 4 verse 6. Benjamin,
[1:44:58] could you come and plug that ugly fan up
[1:45:01] and and let it blow me just a little bit
[1:45:03] here? Uh and because ye are sons.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Now, he's just told us how it started
[1:45:10] with him. The son was revealed in him.
[1:45:13] That's right.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; Now, he's going to tell us about our
[1:45:15] hope. And because ye are sons,
[1:45:20] because ye are sons,
[1:45:24] not to make you sons,
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; because you are sons.
[1:45:30] Do you understand that sunship has
[1:45:33] different Thank you, son. It has
[1:45:35] different levels,
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; but you're always as a born again
[1:45:40] believer, you're always a son.
[1:45:43] and and and you may start off uh as a
[1:45:46] technon,
[1:45:48] a little infant,
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; and that's a horrible stage sometime
[1:45:53] both naturally and spiritually. You see,
[1:45:56] I've been around long enough to
[1:45:58] experience what they call the terrible
[1:46:00] twos
[1:46:02] in the spiritual. Praise God.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; When you when you got babes in Christ
[1:46:07] that begin to uh cut their uh eye teeth,
[1:46:10] their jaw teeth on the meat of the word,
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; uh they they can go through that
[1:46:16] terrible two- stage where where you
[1:46:18] really want to lock them up
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; uh uh spiritually speaking.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; Because they're just bundles of energy.
[1:46:31] They're ready to take on the world,
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; but but they don't have the authority to
[1:46:36] go with the power that they have found.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; And so this process of school masters
[1:46:41] and tutors, the Bible talks about Paul
[1:46:44] particularly talks about growing them up
[1:46:47] and training them up so that one day
[1:46:49] they're more than than just technons.
[1:46:52] They're wheel sons.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; And those wheel sons are those who have
[1:46:56] the authority of the father.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; Hello. and they are authorized to
[1:47:00] conduct business in the father's name.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; And their name on the check is as good
[1:47:05] as his name on the check.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; This is the full adoption process.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; This is the scriptural Middle Eastern
[1:47:12] form of adoption. Nothing like our
[1:47:15] Americanized form of adoption today. Uh
[1:47:19] this is one that you qualify for by
[1:47:22] learning all that you need to learn.
[1:47:25] Nobody's just going to turn an
[1:47:27] inheritance over to you unless you go
[1:47:29] through the process of being tested and
[1:47:32] tried. I'll give you a little authority
[1:47:34] first and if you fail, I'm going to take
[1:47:37] some of that back.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; but I'll give you I'll try again.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; That's what it what our school master
[1:47:46] says to us. A and if you'll prove me now
[1:47:50] a
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; as trustworthy, I'll give you a little
[1:47:53] more of that authority
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; until one day you'll no longer have to
[1:47:56] say I'm the son of so and so. You'll
[1:47:59] just go down and say I'm here to conduct
[1:48:01] business.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; This is what the scripture teaches.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "We're looking for this."
[1:48:06] And Paul knew it well. And now he said
[1:48:09] uh uh first he spoke about the son being
[1:48:11] revealed in him. And now he says, "And
[1:48:13] because you are sons,
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; God hath sent forth the spirit of his
[1:48:19] son
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; where on you
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; into."
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Now Paul is identifying what was poured
[1:48:29] out on the day of Pentecost.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; And he's not identifying this as a third
[1:48:34] person of the Trinity.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; He's identifying this as the very same
[1:48:39] spirit that was on Jesus Christ. Look,
[1:48:41] he said, "God hath sent forth the spirit
[1:48:44] of who?"
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; His son where into your hearts
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; crying,
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; "Papa,
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; aba,
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; aba, father."
[1:49:02] It's incredible that with all of the
[1:49:04] Greek choices
[1:49:06] of uh interpreted words in the New
[1:49:09] Testament, it's amazing that there was
[1:49:12] at least one Hebrew expression that made
[1:49:15] it all the way through to the New
[1:49:17] Testament. Aba,
[1:49:20] aba, papa. It's like saying daddy.
[1:49:24] It's not like saying father.
[1:49:27] It's a term of endearment.
[1:49:30] And Paul said, "The Son had to be
[1:49:33] revealed in me so that I could teach you
[1:49:38] the way. And because you have learned
[1:49:42] the way,
[1:49:44] because you understand that you are
[1:49:48] sons, God hath sent forth the spirit of
[1:49:52] his son into your hearts." And that
[1:49:56] part, that part of who you are is the
[1:50:00] part that cries out,
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; "Daddy,
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; papa."
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; I had someone ask me, "Is it okay to say
[1:50:08] papa?" Is it okay to say aba if you're
[1:50:10] talking about the son?
[1:50:13] Here's the answer. Galatians 4:6. God
[1:50:17] hath sent forth the spirit of his son
[1:50:21] into your hearts crying
[1:50:24] aba papa daddy
[1:50:27] father
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; understand that the eternal spirit of
[1:50:32] the creator is above us but at the same
[1:50:36] time the spirit of the son same spirit
[1:50:41] same spirit and the word
[1:50:45] became
[1:50:46] flesh. I know we're going slow.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; I'm slow. I feel slow,
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; but it's all right.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery of God 160. God
[1:50:57] expressed in Jesus Christ who was both
[1:51:01] father, son, and Holy Ghost. The
[1:51:02] fullness of the Godhead bodily. You
[1:51:04] should be familiar with this. Now, the
[1:51:07] complete fullness of the Godhead bodily
[1:51:09] dwells in his church. I I hear people
[1:51:12] reading it and they gloss over that as
[1:51:15] though it's not a major explosion.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; This is a major explosion.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; Now the complete fullness.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; Say fullness.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; Fullness.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; Was there any part of the word that
[1:51:34] didn't become flesh in Jesus Christ? I'm
[1:51:37] asking you carefully. Was there any part
[1:51:40] of the word? John 1:1, in the beginning
[1:51:43] was the word, and the word was with God,
[1:51:45] and the word was God.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; Verse 14, and the word became flesh and
[1:51:51] dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory,
[1:51:54] the glory as of the only begotten of the
[1:51:55] father, full of grace and truth. Was
[1:51:58] there any part of the word,
[1:52:01] this is logos, is there any part of the
[1:52:04] word that didn't find its bodily
[1:52:07] expression in Jesus Christ?
[1:52:11] The red letters are the key. If you go
[1:52:14] open your Bible to the red letters and
[1:52:16] read what Jesus said, he will leave you
[1:52:18] with no doubt
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; because he said uh as I mentioned last
[1:52:22] Sunday, he said, "You you've been
[1:52:24] looking for me. You've been talking
[1:52:26] about you've been looking for him.
[1:52:28] You've been talking about him and you
[1:52:30] didn't even know him
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; because I've been here with you all
[1:52:33] along.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; And if you would have known him, you
[1:52:37] would have recognized who I am.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; You You didn't really know father. You
[1:52:42] didn't really know father. Because if
[1:52:44] you would have really known father, you
[1:52:46] would have recognized father
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; as he stood before you in the sun.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus said. Am I am I taken
[1:52:53] away? I know. I know. which I know we're
[1:52:55] dragging on here, but but am I taking
[1:52:57] away from the truth or am I telling you
[1:52:59] exactly what the truth said? So, in
[1:53:01] Christ dwelt the fullness
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; of the word,
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; the fullness of the Godhead
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; in bodily form.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; And now a prophet is here to tell us, of
[1:53:14] course, the scriptures are clear, but
[1:53:15] here he is to reinforce this. And he
[1:53:18] tells us now the complete fullness of
[1:53:22] the Godhead bodily.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; This is big.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; I want somebody to pop. I I want
[1:53:30] somebody Please. Thank you. Thank you. I
[1:53:33] I can't let this moment go by without
[1:53:36] somebody letting off a little steam
[1:53:38] here. This is huge.
[1:53:41] It is
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; the full, the complete
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; perfected fullness of the Godhead. All
[1:53:48] that the father, all that the son, all
[1:53:50] that holy spirit dwells in his church.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; Now, you got to know what his church is.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; He only has one.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; And his church is the one that's built
[1:54:03] on the rock,
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; not Peter Petro, the rock of revelation.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if a now listen I don't want to
[1:54:11] upset nobody especially visitors here
[1:54:13] but let me just be plain. If a church is
[1:54:16] built on anything less
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; than the revelation of who Jesus is
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; if they call him anything less than what
[1:54:24] the word has called him.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; If they call him a a second person
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; that makes him a spare wheel.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; He's certainly not that.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:54:38] I hear them even around this message
[1:54:40] calling him less.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; They keep using that son of God. Son of
[1:54:46] God, son of God, as though it is a
[1:54:48] lesser title.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; It's actually not.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; It's actually not. It's a chip off the
[1:54:55] old block.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; You may find a quote or two that make it
[1:55:00] look like there's some. And the ones
[1:55:02] they like are the ones that talk about
[1:55:03] his baptism.
[1:55:06] And that's because they forget what
[1:55:08] we've been taught about adoption.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; Though we were God,
[1:55:14] I really believe the scripture clear.
[1:55:15] Though we were God,
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; he was God all along. Jesus was word
[1:55:20] made flesh all along.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; He was Godhead entirely, entirety, all
[1:55:26] of it
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; was in his flesh.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; Though he were God, yet he learned
[1:55:31] obedience
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; by the things he suffered. Scripture
[1:55:36] said so.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; And in all manner tempted even as we
[1:55:39] are.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; Bible said so.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; I know I keep asking. If I felt like you
[1:55:45] were wouldn't keep asking. I won't get
[1:55:48] on your nerves too bad. But if he were
[1:55:50] not all of that
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; and if you make him anything less than
[1:55:56] that, then you're not the church.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; This is very hard to say,
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; but that's not the church. It's a false
[1:56:05] representation of church.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; And the promises that apply to the
[1:56:10] church. It doesn't mean a building. It
[1:56:12] doesn't mean new hope.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; This is a universal body.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; It's one you can't join by membership.
[1:56:19] It's one you have to be born into.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; And that's not in a natural birth.
[1:56:23] That's a you got your earth birth.
[1:56:25] That's the heaven birth. That's the
[1:56:26] birth from above.
[1:56:28] Come on.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; We still through the years, we've still
[1:56:31] had people come and say, "Could I move
[1:56:33] my letter?" Your what? Could I move my
[1:56:37] letter?
[1:56:39] Can you call my old church and see if
[1:56:41] they can send you my letter?
[1:56:47] My mama was Baptist, so I know what that
[1:56:49] is. Or but I like to play dumb sometime.
[1:56:53] You what? you know your letter that says
[1:56:56] you're a member of say oh no
[1:57:01] we don't need that
[1:57:03] we don't have a membership roster
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; you you can't join this church
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; this is not an open membership church
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; the Bible said his church is the church
[1:57:16] of the firstborn
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; the only way to get into that church the
[1:57:21] church that's built on the revelation of
[1:57:23] who Jesus is is to be born into that
[1:57:26] church.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; And you're born into it by by water.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; By proper baptism
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; and by spirit,
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; the infilling of the Holy Ghost.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; Does it matter how you're baptized? I
[1:57:41] guess it does. If you want to join the
[1:57:43] right church,
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; if you're only carrying the baptism of a
[1:57:47] title, uh, then I don't know exactly
[1:57:49] what you're a part of, but I don't want
[1:57:51] nothing to do with it. I'll tell you
[1:57:52] that right now. If you want to be a part
[1:57:54] of his church, you've got to be willing
[1:57:56] to wear his name.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; After all, I know you're bored.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; After all, you're a part of a corporate
[1:58:05] Messiah.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; Shouldn't you wear a portion of
[1:58:08] Messiah's name?
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; No wonder, brother Brandon preached that
[1:58:12] this little bride is Ms. Jesus Christ.
[1:58:21] Uh because Eve was in Adam,
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; the bride was in Christ.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; He told us flesh of his flesh,
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; bone of
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; bone of his bone.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; He said now now uh the Godhead body
[1:58:40] dwells in his church. The preeminences.
[1:58:41] What time is it anyway? Oh, it's not not
[1:58:43] too bad. All that God was,
[1:58:47] he poured into Christ. And all Christ
[1:58:50] was was poured into the church.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; There are all kind of believers.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; Whosoever callth upon the name of the
[1:59:01] Lord shall be saved.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; That makes him a believer.
[1:59:06] But when I'm talking about a believer
[1:59:08] here, I'm talking about more than just
[1:59:10] being uh a name on a number, a name on a
[1:59:12] roll or a number on a chart.
[1:59:16] I'm talking about being a part of the
[1:59:18] church of the redeemed
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; things that are to be realto. He said,
[1:59:22] "Now you're expressed after his word has
[1:59:23] come in you to light up this age. You
[1:59:26] are the expressing."
[1:59:28] Somebody say, "I am the expressing."
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; If God is going to express himself in
[1:59:33] these last days, he's not going to do it
[1:59:36] just in a light, a cloud, a pillar of
[1:59:39] fire. He can do all those things. He can
[1:59:41] show himself powerful in a rainbow. He
[1:59:44] can do all of these things, but but if
[1:59:46] he's really going to express himself in
[1:59:48] these last days, he won't have to just
[1:59:50] rely on all of these other uh
[1:59:53] demonstrations or manifestations of
[1:59:55] other dispensations. He's now finding a
[1:59:58] way to express himself in the last of
[2:00:00] the last days.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; And that's in a corporate messiah. Amen.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; If that coin ever drops,
[2:00:12] if that ever drops in you,
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; if you ever catch a big old glimpse of
[2:00:18] why you're here, it's so popular to say
[2:00:21] today, discover your why. Discover your
[2:00:24] why. Discover your why. And and I like
[2:00:27] it. I actually like it. I actually like
[2:00:29] the fact that they are encouraging
[2:00:32] people to discover their purpose
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; because some people think that their
[2:00:37] purpose is just to exist
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; as perhaps a survivor.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; But we sang this morning about the
[2:00:46] overcomer.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; And we know what he said. Because I
[2:00:50] overcome,
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; you can also overcome. And that's the
[2:00:56] that's the first part of the discovery
[2:00:58] of your why. Knowing that you are not a
[2:01:00] survivor.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; You are not a skin of the teeth
[2:01:04] Christian.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; But you've been called as an overcomer.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; That means you got to get over
[2:01:11] something.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; What is it that you and I have to come
[2:01:16] over?
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; We have to come over the spirit of the
[2:01:19] age.
[2:01:20] We have to come over land toa
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; cold Christianity formal religion
[2:01:28] lukewarm existence
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; barely surviving
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; when we're called to overcome
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; behold I give you power
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; hello
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; behold I give you power
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; over what?
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; Over what?
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; Over what? all
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; all power. Hallelujah.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; He said, "You're sitting in this church
[2:01:54] tonight because your duty is to express
[2:01:57] God to this nation and this people and
[2:02:00] this neighborhood where you associate."
[2:02:03] You see, there's a difference between a
[2:02:05] personal individual anointing and you
[2:02:08] can carry yours. It's all right.
[2:02:12] There will be different administrations
[2:02:15] of the anointing in different individual
[2:02:18] lives.
[2:02:22] You know, everybody says, "I want to
[2:02:23] play. I'd like to play the piano."
[2:02:26] Have you ever met anybody that hadn't
[2:02:28] said, maybe you have, "I've I've hardly
[2:02:30] met anybody around the church who has
[2:02:33] said, I there's one thing I sure would
[2:02:35] never want to do. I would never want to
[2:02:37] be able to play the piano like they do."
[2:02:39] Have you ever heard anybody say that?
[2:02:41] Everybody says, "Oh, I want to play."
[2:02:44] Oh, oh, I wish I could play the piano
[2:02:46] like Cade. Oh, I wish I could play the
[2:02:48] piano like Sister Laurel. Oh, I wish I
[2:02:50] could play the piano like Marbette or
[2:02:52] whoever else. Jonathan,
[2:02:55] when you hear Jonathan, you hear a lot
[2:02:57] of Jonathan. You also hear a lot of his
[2:02:59] teacher. You hear a lot of Sister West.
[2:03:01] And it's wonderful to me. It's a sound
[2:03:03] that I grew up on here.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; And I love it. And I and I don't I hope
[2:03:08] he takes that as a compliment. I think
[2:03:10] you do because I hear him. I hear his
[2:03:14] licks and frills and things that God's
[2:03:16] given him, but I also hear some
[2:03:18] progressions in there that that uh were
[2:03:21] were sort of created and forerrun by
[2:03:24] Sister Janette West.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; But but how many of you let let's be
[2:03:28] honest, how many of you'd like to play
[2:03:29] the piano? You just really love to sit
[2:03:31] down and my my play the piano.
[2:03:34] Some of you don't want to do anything.
[2:03:40] Some of you will watch a 4-hour program
[2:03:41] because you're too lazy to get up and
[2:03:43] change the channel.
[2:03:49] Don't talk to me about what you want to
[2:03:50] do.
[2:03:53] I can insult with a straight face
[2:03:55] sometime.
[2:03:57] Oh, I wish I could be. But here's the
[2:03:59] reality. The proof
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; of the desire
[2:04:05] is in the pursuit.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; You really don't want to play the piano
[2:04:10] if you're not even willing to pursue to
[2:04:12] learn the scale.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; What you mean is you want to go sit down
[2:04:18] the piano and have God fall in your lap
[2:04:20] and teach you how to play the piano. You
[2:04:22] get up, you never had to learn a note of
[2:04:24] music.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; And that has happened for a very few
[2:04:26] people. The reason why it doesn't happen
[2:04:29] more for people is because we have a
[2:04:31] tendency to take that kind of gift for
[2:04:33] granted.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; But the kind we work with
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; and we train and tune it.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; It still comes from God. The talent, the
[2:04:42] gift is from God. Yes, sir.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; But these people who think they don't
[2:04:45] have to practice, somebody said, you
[2:04:47] know, I've been doing certain certain
[2:04:48] things for 40 years and I don't need to
[2:04:50] practice. I beg your pardon.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; I hear your sour notes, too. Right.
[2:04:59] We we're we're taking this gift
[2:05:01] seriously
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; and we're working with it to improve it.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; But if we really wanted to learn to
[2:05:08] play, we would learn to play.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; I don't believe there's anybody that
[2:05:11] couldn't learn. You may not have the the
[2:05:13] personal anointing to play like someone
[2:05:16] else. But that doesn't mean you can't
[2:05:18] learn the music. You can certainly learn
[2:05:20] the music. So there is a personal
[2:05:22] anointing.
[2:05:24] Most people can carry a tune
[2:05:28] until you give them a note, a key.
[2:05:32] Sometimes when you give them a key,
[2:05:34] they're they're lost.
[2:05:37] I heard a young man, African-American
[2:05:38] man, singing at the youth camp last
[2:05:40] night, and I tell you what, I wanted to
[2:05:42] to commend him. I was streaming it. I
[2:05:45] wanted to commend him because the piano
[2:05:47] player was most definitely not following
[2:05:50] the tag.
[2:05:52] In fact, none of the amazing musicians
[2:05:54] present were really following the tag.
[2:05:57] And that young man, I tell you what I
[2:05:59] would have done. I would have been in
[2:06:00] big trouble because I have a tendency to
[2:06:03] lose the melody. And if I lose the
[2:06:05] melody, I'll sing with the music. And a
[2:06:08] lot of people do. I I can say that
[2:06:11] because I'm not the only person. We see
[2:06:14] it demonstrated from time to time. The
[2:06:16] piano does something different and the
[2:06:18] voice goes right with the piano. And uh
[2:06:21] that can be a disaster.
[2:06:24] But that young man maintained enough of
[2:06:26] his melody
[2:06:28] that he didn't lose his spot.
[2:06:31] The he had to adjust the melody
[2:06:34] slightly, but he got through the song
[2:06:37] without being in a different key. Did
[2:06:39] you see a cage? Do you know what I'm
[2:06:40] talking about? He he got through it, and
[2:06:42] I was impressed. I would have liked to
[2:06:44] have uh uh given him a a bouquet of of
[2:06:48] flowery words because it takes a lot to
[2:06:51] be able to do that. He has an anointing
[2:06:53] and his anointing wasn't based on what
[2:06:56] the and I'm sure the piano player, he
[2:06:58] was doing amazing on other songs, but he
[2:07:00] obviously never heard that little tag
[2:07:01] part and he could not get it. He tried
[2:07:03] so hard. Well, no, actually he he tried
[2:07:06] for a little while and then he stopped
[2:07:08] playing,
[2:07:12] which really leaves you out in the cold
[2:07:15] with your with your uh boxer shorts,
[2:07:21] but because that young man had a
[2:07:23] personal anointing
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; to carry the tune.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; So, everyone can have it. You can have
[2:07:30] one to worship. You can have one to
[2:07:32] play. You can have one to speak. You can
[2:07:33] have one to pray. That's not what we're
[2:07:36] talking about. We're talking about a
[2:07:38] corporate anointing. That's a portion
[2:07:41] that's given to all of us. Let me read
[2:07:43] some notes and close.
[2:07:45] There are those great moments when we
[2:07:49] become so aware of the manifested
[2:07:52] presence, the anointing, the cavode, the
[2:07:55] shecka, the heavy glory of the Lord.
[2:07:58] Those moments when it is the will and
[2:08:02] purpose of our God to allow us a moment
[2:08:06] of encounter, a personal and intimate
[2:08:10] interaction with him.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; There may be others gathered near, but
[2:08:16] in those few short moments of time,
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; everything and everyone fades from your
[2:08:22] conscious thoughts. And for that moment,
[2:08:25] you may be in a crowded church room, but
[2:08:27] for that moment, it is only you and the
[2:08:29] bridegroom. How many of you have ever
[2:08:31] experienced a moment like that? These
[2:08:34] times may seem far too few and way too
[2:08:38] much time in between, but the weight
[2:08:43] the weight of those encounters can
[2:08:46] continue to strengthen and encourage us
[2:08:48] for days and weeks and months and
[2:08:50] sometimes even years. Amen.
[2:08:53] &gt;&gt; The impact
[2:08:55] of one night.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; With the king
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; as we revisit them in our regular times
[2:09:03] of praise and thanksgiving. It's almost
[2:09:05] sometime like we draw strength from
[2:09:07] those moments of encounter again. If you
[2:09:10] believe that, say amen. Amen.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; For those who prepare and position
[2:09:14] themselves, there can also be daily
[2:09:17] daily interactions and engagements
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; with the anointing because you don't
[2:09:23] have to go to church to find the
[2:09:24] anointing.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; You don't have to have mood music to
[2:09:29] find the anointing.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; The anointing is within you as a part of
[2:09:32] the corporate Messiah.
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, it may sound old fogy,
[2:09:37] but he's as close.
[2:09:40] He
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; is as close
[2:09:42] as the mention of his name.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; It's not saying it like you're reading
[2:09:48] it off of a sign board. It's saying it
[2:09:50] like you know who you're talking.
[2:09:52] Raboni.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; Raboni.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; She said rabbi.
[2:09:59] Rabbi means teacher.
[2:10:01] But there was something about the way
[2:10:03] that she recognized her teacher now
[2:10:07] raised from the dead.
[2:10:10] now resurrected. Are you here?
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; Raboni.
[2:10:17] It's like saying to him, "Master,
[2:10:21] I I'm not going to call anybody master."
[2:10:23] Someone said, "It doesn't matter whether
[2:10:26] you call a master or not. You're a slave
[2:10:29] to somebody or something."
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; I'd rather be a bondervant.
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; I'd rather be a bond slave for the Lord
[2:10:37] Jesus Christ. I'd rather him have my
[2:10:39] ownership.
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying?
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; I I'd rather be totally surrendered
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; and obedient, submitted to his purpose
[2:10:48] and will. I don't mind calling him my
[2:10:50] master.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus, we sang for years. Jesus is my
[2:10:55] Lord, my master and Savior now and
[2:10:59] forever more.
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; For those who prepare and position
[2:11:03] themselves, there can also be daily
[2:11:04] interactions and engagements with the
[2:11:06] anointing. While reading his written
[2:11:08] word, while meditating on his goodness,
[2:11:11] while interceding on behalf of others in
[2:11:14] prayer,
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; while listening to a sermon that
[2:11:17] particularly stirs within you those
[2:11:19] seeds of destiny that are in you to
[2:11:22] inspire and guide you along on your
[2:11:25] spiritual journey.
[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; But that's not all.
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; We're not just talking about those
[2:11:31] moments of bliss and glory. There's
[2:11:34] still another powerful way to engage and
[2:11:36] encounter the anointing, the presence of
[2:11:39] the anointed one. We were also created
[2:11:42] to encounter him in a corporate way.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; The corporate anointing. And here it is
[2:11:48] in a nutshell. He is the head.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; He is the head.
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; He is the head
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; and he dwells in us
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; in a corporate body.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; Is the body a part of the head? Is the
[2:12:04] head a part of the body?
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; You think if you check the DNA in the
[2:12:12] head,
[2:12:14] it'd be the same DNA that you found in
[2:12:16] the body.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; Do you think if you check the blood type
[2:12:20] that was flowing through the brain, it'd
[2:12:22] be the same blood that was flowing
[2:12:24] through your little toe? Yeah.
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; Do you think that you not only have
[2:12:29] blood that flows but you have cells that
[2:12:31] are migrating through your body at all
[2:12:34] times?
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; Did you know a recent study has
[2:12:37] discovered that there are uh amazing
[2:12:41] opportunities for neuroplasticity
[2:12:44] past the age of 80.
[2:12:49] For years, brain science believed that
[2:12:52] all you can do is live with the brain
[2:12:54] you're born with. You can't change it.
[2:12:56] You can't improve it. You can't rewire
[2:12:59] it. You don't even have the ability to
[2:13:02] reproduce healthier brain cells.
[2:13:06] Thanks be to God. It has now been
[2:13:09] discovered and proven what brother
[2:13:11] Brandon was already preaching in the 50s
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; that we have a way of rewiring
[2:13:17] the hardware
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; of our brain.
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; And then they thought you only have the
[2:13:25] ability to do that to to to about 21 to
[2:13:28] 24.
[2:13:30] And then they thought that they were
[2:13:32] able to discover
[2:13:34] by scans that there were new brain cells
[2:13:38] that were unlike original brain cells,
[2:13:40] healthier, stronger brain cells than
[2:13:44] than what had been produced in this body
[2:13:46] before. And they found that happening
[2:13:48] all the way up to 55 and 60 and 65. Can
[2:13:52] you imagine being 65 years old when
[2:13:54] everybody around you has already started
[2:13:56] declining?
[2:14:02] and your brain is producing healthier
[2:14:04] cells than it did when you were in your
[2:14:06] teens. Well, science has proven now this
[2:14:09] is possible. And now they have scanned
[2:14:11] under long studies
[2:14:14] people who have reached 80 plus and they
[2:14:18] have seen new synapses, new firings of
[2:14:22] of of of neuron connections in the brain
[2:14:26] and new healthy brain cells better,
[2:14:29] healthier, stronger than the original
[2:14:32] brain cells of the body. Somebody said,
[2:14:34] "Why are you telling us this?" Because
[2:14:36] it's the miracle of the creator.
[2:14:41] It's a we are fearfully and wonderfully
[2:14:44] made.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; And it also tells me that you you uh
[2:14:48] maybe maybe you know a child born uh
[2:14:52] with addiction
[2:14:53] uh side effects because of an addicted
[2:14:58] mother. Or maybe you know someone who
[2:15:01] struggles on the on the on the
[2:15:04] multiaceted scale of autism.
[2:15:08] and you have determined that you have to
[2:15:12] uh own it and the title and and and
[2:15:15] celebrate knowing that's all that that
[2:15:18] person will ever be capable of. But I'm
[2:15:20] telling you right now, the brain science
[2:15:22] is now proving what the word says.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; You can renew this thing.
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, Lord.
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; And you won't do it by following the
[2:15:37] latest Spiderman.
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; You are what you eat.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; I'm expecting some of you to start
[2:15:45] climbing up the walls and spinning webs
[2:15:49] because we are what we eat.
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; But you can by feasting on what is true,
[2:15:56] what is holy, what is pure.
[2:15:59] The scripture said, "Think on these
[2:16:01] things.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; Meditate on these things." I'm closing,
[2:16:05] but I I I uh I'm happy where I am, but
[2:16:08] I'm closing.
[2:16:10] We're created to encounter something
[2:16:12] called the corporate anointing. He is
[2:16:14] the head and he dwells in us as a
[2:16:16] corporate body. Therefore, guess what?
[2:16:18] He is both head
[2:16:22] and body.
[2:16:24] I thought you said he was the head and
[2:16:26] we're the body. I did.
[2:16:28] Now you're saying he is the head and
[2:16:31] he's the body. I did
[2:16:35] because he's both head and body.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; And many have missed a very important
[2:16:40] truth here. A bride as bride and then
[2:16:45] wife.
[2:16:47] There is a transition from bride to
[2:16:48] wife.
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; It's a matter of trust.
[2:16:53] It's a matter of exposure.
[2:16:55] It's a matter of being willing to show
[2:16:58] the bridegroom.
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; Are you just dragging on purpose
[2:17:07] here?
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; You know, you take a girl out. I mean,
[2:17:17] it's been a long time since I did.
[2:17:25] and they don't eat.
[2:17:29] They order, but they don't eat.
[2:17:33] Well, let me tell you something. They
[2:17:35] crammed out going out the door,
[2:17:38] mister. And they crammed when they got
[2:17:40] home so that they wouldn't have to eat
[2:17:43] in front of you.
[2:17:49] Some girls are embarrassed to even
[2:17:51] excuse themselves to the washroom when
[2:17:54] they're with somebody they care about.
[2:17:56] How long do you think you're going to be
[2:17:58] maintain that?
[2:18:02] You live in the same house one day.
[2:18:04] You're going to wait till he goes to
[2:18:06] work
[2:18:07] to go to the bathroom, close the door,
[2:18:09] and say, "I got to have a little peace
[2:18:11] here."
[2:18:14] you you're going to sit and watch him
[2:18:16] eat breakfast and then he's barely out
[2:18:17] the door before you are you didn't even
[2:18:19] heat up the leftovers. You're just
[2:18:24] everything has to match. You look like a
[2:18:26] rag doll all the rest of the time, but
[2:18:29] but you're going out the door to meet
[2:18:31] him, you know, and you just got to have
[2:18:33] it all fixed up,
[2:18:36] all together.
[2:18:38] That's the way it's supposed to be.
[2:18:41] It's that getting to know one another
[2:18:43] stage. Maybe it would be good if it
[2:18:46] could maintain that a little bit longer
[2:18:47] than we actually do. It's not practical
[2:18:50] and it's certainly not livable.
[2:18:53] There comes a time as you marry that you
[2:18:55] know everything there is to know about
[2:18:58] the per I hope I hope you can discover
[2:19:02] as much as possible before you say I do.
[2:19:04] Yeah,
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; cuz every monster that's hidden can
[2:19:08] quickly come out when they get what they
[2:19:12] want.
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; Preach on.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; But here's the reality. You you you know
[2:19:24] they they uh
[2:19:27] they don't have any eyelashes, so they
[2:19:28] buy them.
[2:19:30] I saw a poor girl yesterday.
[2:19:33] I I I I wanted to like a granddaddy, I
[2:19:38] wanted to reach out and say to her,
[2:19:41] "Sweetheart,
[2:19:45] what do you see?"
[2:19:48] Have you ever wondered what somebody
[2:19:49] sees when they look in the mirror? What
[2:19:51] do you see when you look in the mirror?
[2:19:54] You couldn't possibly see what I see.
[2:19:59] her her eyelashes so heavy, so glued on,
[2:20:03] and so heavy that she couldn't even
[2:20:05] hardly hold them up. I'm not
[2:20:07] exaggerating. She weighed about 86
[2:20:09] pounds.
[2:20:12] And she and she'd had a baby.
[2:20:16] She could hardly open her eyelids
[2:20:20] because of the weight of those
[2:20:23] synthetic spiders she was wearing in
[2:20:25] preparation for Halloween.
[2:20:29] And she had
[2:20:31] caked on every chemical you can buy in a
[2:20:34] bottle. And there was nothing real about
[2:20:36] her.
[2:20:38] She didn't even walk like a normal
[2:20:40] person. She didn't hold her head like a
[2:20:43] normal person or keep her eyes open like
[2:20:45] a normal person. My heart went out to
[2:20:47] her.
[2:20:50] One day
[2:20:52] you're not going to be able to keep up
[2:20:53] that charade.
[2:20:57] Somebody's going to know you.
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; You fixed up in them jeans and fixed up
[2:21:02] in that. But but one of these days,
[2:21:05] you're you're going to hopefully find
[2:21:07] somebody you can spend the rest of your
[2:21:08] life with. And he's going to know you
[2:21:10] don't have any eyelashes.
[2:21:12] And he's going to know that God didn't
[2:21:14] give you them
[2:21:17] uh spiders on your eyelash. or what I
[2:21:20] was going to say is uh uh God didn't put
[2:21:22] that um botulism in your lips.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; He's going to see you as you really are.
[2:21:30] And if he falls in love with the fake
[2:21:32] and phony version of who you are, I'm
[2:21:34] not sure he's going to love the real
[2:21:36] you.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying?
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; You better know it's not always going to
[2:21:40] stay the way it does in this in the
[2:21:42] according stages. But when you become
[2:21:45] man and wife, there there's nothing
[2:21:47] between you anymore. you you know
[2:21:50] everything. I I know this is plain talk,
[2:21:52] way too plain for most people, but but
[2:21:54] you're going to know you're going to
[2:21:56] know if there's a little too much on the
[2:22:00] You're going to know.
[2:22:04] You're going to know if it was padding
[2:22:06] you were looking at or if it was real.
[2:22:08] You're going to know.
[2:22:13] &gt;&gt; You're going to see the stitches if
[2:22:15] somebody's had a highiny boost.
[2:22:22] I'm not I mean it is funny but I'm not
[2:22:24] particularly trying to be but it is
[2:22:26] funny. You're going to know
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; you can't hide all that. You you better
[2:22:30] know you can love that person.
[2:22:33] &gt;&gt; You see here is what it means to know
[2:22:35] Christ.
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; Same thing.
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; Marriage and the and the husband wife
[2:22:42] relationship I is a model for our
[2:22:45] relationship with Christ. You can dress
[2:22:48] up on Sunday and come and do the
[2:22:49] religious thing, sir.
[2:22:51] &gt;&gt; But he's going home with you,
[2:22:53] &gt;&gt; and he's going to know. He's going to
[2:22:55] know.
[2:22:57] He's going to see. And he's not going to
[2:23:00] love you any less
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; because he's your bridegroom.
[2:23:07] And when you have that moment of of
[2:23:09] intimacy where you're one
[2:23:12] and the light bulb gets left on by
[2:23:14] mistake,
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; you're going to know
[2:23:19] and he's going to know.
[2:23:23] And that's what the Bible's talking
[2:23:25] about when it says no.
[2:23:27] Ko, it's not a it's not a head knowing.
[2:23:31] It's an intimate knowing. And Mary knew
[2:23:34] no man. It didn't mean she had never met
[2:23:37] any. It means she'd never been intimate
[2:23:40] with any. So the kind of knowledge that
[2:23:42] we have to gain as part of the stature
[2:23:45] is not a head one.
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; It's an exposure one.
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; It's being real honest and open. When
[2:23:52] you go before the Lord, you're not
[2:23:53] trying to hide any bulges, any freckles,
[2:23:56] any any odd hair on your toe.
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; You're just saying, "Here I am.
[2:24:02] &gt;&gt; I don't know how you could love me."
[2:24:04] Right?
[2:24:06] I I I I'm rotten. My my pinkie is
[2:24:09] crooked.
[2:24:11] How could you love me? I'm deformed. And
[2:24:13] he loves us more. And it has nothing to
[2:24:17] do with how we look.
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; But it's part of the transition of
[2:24:22] trust.
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; You see, the reason why it's so reserved
[2:24:26] in the beginning is because you don't
[2:24:28] know if he knows too much. If she knows
[2:24:32] too much about who you really are, they
[2:24:34] may run the other way. But as you begin
[2:24:36] to trust that person, you open up and
[2:24:40] you tell them your deepest thoughts and
[2:24:41] desires
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; and they stay
[2:24:47] and they don't run.
[2:24:50] I don't know if you're following me or
[2:24:51] not,
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; but that's our relationship with the
[2:24:54] Lord. And some of us ought to be coming
[2:24:56] clean with him pretty fast
[2:24:59] &gt;&gt; because he wants to know who you really
[2:25:00] are.
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; Not who you pretend to be when others
[2:25:03] are around.
[2:25:04] &gt;&gt; He wants to know the real character of
[2:25:06] your heart because he wants to manifest
[2:25:08] his in you.
[2:25:09] &gt;&gt; And you got to get yours out of the way.
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; Anybody with me?
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; Good. I'm nearly done. You see, here's a
[2:25:16] part that's been missed. Musicians can
[2:25:18] come as bride and then wife. We are to
[2:25:22] dwell with him on earth as a corporate
[2:25:25] messiah.
[2:25:27] And that's a big responsibility.
[2:25:30] It's so big that one man couldn't do it
[2:25:32] in the end of the end days.
[2:25:35] It's so big that a model hear me now.
[2:25:37] Look this way. They don't need you
[2:25:39] watching them walk. They're very capable
[2:25:42] of making it to the music without your
[2:25:44] the assistance of your eyes.
[2:25:48] It's very important that we're able to
[2:25:51] pull this in as we leave here today
[2:25:56] because God's not looking for little
[2:25:58] perfect church children.
[2:26:00] He's looking for a corporate expression
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; of the anointing
[2:26:06] of the Messiah.
[2:26:08] I can I could slam you with scriptures
[2:26:11] if somebody is still wondering, but I'll
[2:26:14] just give you another one here while
[2:26:15] it's in the notes. Acts 17:28, "For in
[2:26:18] him,
[2:26:20] in him we live
[2:26:23] and move and have our being, as certain
[2:26:27] also of your own poets have said, for we
[2:26:30] are also his offspring." May I mention
[2:26:33] that this is a pagan poet that's being
[2:26:35] quoted here,
[2:26:38] not a believer,
[2:26:43] but the apostle is using it because the
[2:26:45] crowd
[2:26:48] can connect
[2:26:50] with this expression,
[2:26:53] we are his offspring. It comes from a
[2:26:55] secular Greek
[2:26:57] poet,
[2:26:59] but he knew that everyone in the crowd
[2:27:01] knew the poem.
[2:27:03] Just like brother Brandham knew that
[2:27:04] everyone in the crowd had seen the
[2:27:06] advertisement for a thinking man's
[2:27:08] filter and he could preach on a
[2:27:11] cigarette pack that he found in the
[2:27:12] woods and have everyone's attention.
[2:27:17] Just like sometimes we can mention
[2:27:18] Barney Fe because because I can't I
[2:27:21] don't care how brother Dwayne he flashes
[2:27:23] his badge and everything, but he he just
[2:27:26] didn't fit the Barney role Barney F role
[2:27:29] for me.
[2:27:31] But I got the point. When I see that
[2:27:33] little that little officer standing out
[2:27:35] there, not much. You're going to blow
[2:27:37] him over with your car, but he flashes
[2:27:39] that badge. It's it's I see Barney F.
[2:27:44] He has nothing physical to make you
[2:27:47] think you ought to stop, but he just
[2:27:49] flashes that authority and you better
[2:27:51] stop. I don't care what he looks like.
[2:27:54] And that's such a powerful truth. So,
[2:27:56] it's okay to even use something that is
[2:27:59] that is a of of a of a cultural uh
[2:28:03] expression if you're going to use it
[2:28:05] with the great value of teaching the
[2:28:07] gospel like the apostle said. For in him
[2:28:10] we we live, we move, we have our being,
[2:28:14] as certain also of your own poets have
[2:28:16] said, for we are also
[2:28:20] his offspring.
[2:28:23] In the message, things that are to be,
[2:28:25] he said, now if we are those attributes
[2:28:27] of God, if we are those attributes of
[2:28:30] God, we cannot live by creeds.
[2:28:33] &gt;&gt; We cannot live by denominationalism.
[2:28:37] We must live by the word.
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; Because the bride is a part
[2:28:42] because the bride is a part of the
[2:28:45] bridegroom. Because the bride is an
[2:28:49] expression of the corporate Messiah in
[2:28:52] the earth.
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:28:56] She's a part of the bridegroom like any
[2:28:58] wife
[2:29:00] is a part of her husband.
[2:29:03] It's actually deeper.
[2:29:06] It's actually deeper than that because
[2:29:09] you're not sharing DNA gene seed with
[2:29:11] your husband.
[2:29:14] But if you're part of that bride of
[2:29:16] Christ,
[2:29:18] he talks about the seed in Greek, the
[2:29:20] sperma.
[2:29:22] You've been implanted. I know this is
[2:29:24] way too plain for some pruds, but it's
[2:29:26] still a you've got a different seed.
[2:29:30] You are a product of your father's
[2:29:32] spermma in the natural. But I want to
[2:29:34] tell you something. You're also a
[2:29:36] continuation
[2:29:38] of a divine seed.
[2:29:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:41] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:29:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; It can't be filled with fast race cars.
[2:29:47] It can't be filled with fits of vodka.
[2:29:49] It can't be filled. You can drown it
[2:29:51] out. You can entertain it. You can give
[2:29:53] it speed and fill part of the need,
[2:29:57] &gt;&gt; but you'll never be able to satisfy.
[2:30:01] &gt;&gt; Goats won't satisfy, and cow won't
[2:30:03] satisfy, and dog won't satisfy, and cat
[2:30:07] won't satisfy.
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; My dad was born with some kind of hunger
[2:30:12] for God, and he tried to fill it with
[2:30:15] with a persona.
[2:30:18] First, it was the ham radio CB. He was
[2:30:22] Uncle Bud and and and that was for
[2:30:25] Budweiser
[2:30:27] and that was his handle. He tried to
[2:30:29] drown the hunger and desire for
[2:30:32] something bigger and better, something
[2:30:34] more. He tried to drown it with a
[2:30:37] persona of a case of Uncle Buds.
[2:30:42] And then he went from one thing to
[2:30:44] another, a Drax draster car where he
[2:30:48] raced on the drag strip. and then the
[2:30:50] demol demolition
[2:30:53] race.
[2:30:55] And then he had miniature cows. And then
[2:30:57] he had miniature donkeys. And then he
[2:31:00] was raising minks.
[2:31:03] And the next thing I know he he's got
[2:31:06] monster trucks.
[2:31:09] And then I don't know how you move from
[2:31:11] monster trucks to racing go-karts. But
[2:31:14] he went from showing monster trucks to
[2:31:17] racing go-karts.
[2:31:20] And then there was something else. And
[2:31:22] then there was something else. And then
[2:31:24] there was something. Does it sound
[2:31:25] familiar to anybody? And then there was
[2:31:27] something else. And then there was
[2:31:28] something else. He spent his entire life
[2:31:30] chasing the wind.
[2:31:33] The wind in a circuit. And he's chasing
[2:31:36] after something that satisfies. I'm
[2:31:38] telling you, if you're born with a
[2:31:40] representation,
[2:31:42] it's some people call it an empty spot,
[2:31:44] but it that's really it's not a vacuum.
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; No,
[2:31:47] &gt;&gt; it's actually something there. It's not
[2:31:49] the absence of something. It's the
[2:31:51] presence of something.
[2:31:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:54] &gt;&gt; And you'll never feel it.
[2:31:56] &gt;&gt; Never.
[2:31:58] &gt;&gt; Five wives won't feel it.
[2:31:59] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:32:00] &gt;&gt; Five husbands won't fill it.
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; Here she stands. Go tell your husband, I
[2:32:05] have none. Oh, you you've had none.
[2:32:09] You've had five.
[2:32:12] And the one you're living with right now
[2:32:13] is not your own. But I didn't tell you
[2:32:16] that to condemn you.
[2:32:19] &gt;&gt; Six.
[2:32:21] &gt;&gt; Five. Five husbands living with somebody
[2:32:24] else's husband. Six. And guess what? She
[2:32:26] found everything she had been looking
[2:32:28] for in the seventh man.
[2:32:34] Fat husband didn't last. Skinny husband
[2:32:37] didn't last. Rich husband didn't last.
[2:32:40] Poor husband didn't last. Smart husband
[2:32:43] didn't last. And the man she was living
[2:32:45] with was dumber than a box of rocks. And
[2:32:48] that didn't satisfy.
[2:32:51] &gt;&gt; But she found everything.
[2:32:54] &gt;&gt; She thought it was better sexuality she
[2:32:57] was looking for. Come on.
[2:32:59] &gt;&gt; Let's be honest.
[2:33:01] &gt;&gt; She She thought it was more security.
[2:33:03] She need She didn't even know. She
[2:33:06] didn't even know what she was looking
[2:33:08] for.
[2:33:10] &gt;&gt; Woo! Glory.
[2:33:12] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:33:12] &gt;&gt; And neither did we.
[2:33:15] &gt;&gt; Until she found it.
[2:33:20] &gt;&gt; It's so powerful.
[2:33:21] &gt;&gt; I got to hush. It's so powerful, though.
[2:33:24] He had a shorter route. He had more than
[2:33:27] one shorter route.
[2:33:30] But he said, "I must need to go."
[2:33:34] Why? Because there was a part of him.
[2:33:37] There was a representation
[2:33:39] of what he was the fullness of.
[2:33:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:41] &gt;&gt; That was going to the well,
[2:33:44] not when all the others went. She went
[2:33:46] alone. She was ostracized. Believe me,
[2:33:50] she wasn't called an adulteress because
[2:33:52] she had five husbands. She was
[2:33:54] considered a
[2:33:57] She wouldn't even go and get her water
[2:33:59] with the rest of the women. And had she
[2:34:01] have gone with Who cares?
[2:34:05] Who cares if the world ostracizes you?
[2:34:09] If you if you've got Christ,
[2:34:11] we have to get to a place where, you
[2:34:13] know, if they don't want to eat a turkey
[2:34:15] leg with me once a year,
[2:34:18] &gt;&gt; there's more turkey legs for me.
[2:34:22] &gt;&gt; You You do. You have to come to a place
[2:34:24] where where where you're not thriving
[2:34:26] only on these natural relationships
[2:34:29] &gt;&gt; because if she would have gone when
[2:34:30] everybody else went, she would have
[2:34:33] missed him.
[2:34:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:37] &gt;&gt; He got there just in time.
[2:34:39] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:34:40] &gt;&gt; And he spoke to her in a way she had
[2:34:42] never been spoken to before. He spoke to
[2:34:45] the seed that was within her. Brother
[2:34:47] Brandham likes to dramatize the story
[2:34:49] and he tells us about how she sat on her
[2:34:51] mother's knee as a little girl and heard
[2:34:53] the mighty works and the exploits of a
[2:34:56] mighty God. Somebody ought to hear me.
[2:34:58] &gt;&gt; And it planted all these little seeds
[2:35:01] that mixed in with what God had
[2:35:03] represented in her from the beginning.
[2:35:05] And she starts building this desire for
[2:35:08] him.
[2:35:09] And she don't know what to do with it.
[2:35:11] She went to synagogue. It wasn't there.
[2:35:13] She went to what was going on in in the
[2:35:16] Samaritan worship and it it was nothing
[2:35:18] there and and she's just just just
[2:35:21] living life just barely getting by until
[2:35:24] she meets him.
[2:35:27] Brother Bram said, "What was he doing?"
[2:35:28] He was just contacting her spirit. He
[2:35:31] asked her all of these questions just
[2:35:33] trying to contact the inner part of who
[2:35:35] she was.
[2:35:40] And it was the sun, the s o n shining on
[2:35:43] the seed.
[2:35:47] And she said, "Come see a man."
[2:35:50] Oh yeah, there she goes.
[2:35:53] The flucy's running after another man.
[2:35:57] She said, "No, no, no. Not that kind of
[2:36:00] a man. It's not a new boyfriend. It's
[2:36:03] not a new bedmate. It's not a new lover
[2:36:06] that I'm advertising today. I want you
[2:36:08] to know, come see a man who told me
[2:36:11] everything that I've ever done.
[2:36:14] &gt;&gt; He knew all there was to know about me.
[2:36:17] But I could tell by the way he looked at
[2:36:19] me, he loved me.
[2:36:22] &gt;&gt; He saw past my sin. He saw past my
[2:36:25] mistake. He saw past number husband 1,
[2:36:28] two, three, four, and five. And living
[2:36:30] in a He saw past that.
[2:36:33] &gt;&gt; And he saw something in me.
[2:36:36] No wonder Mahalia Jackson was saying he
[2:36:38] went she went running running running
[2:36:40] running running running running running
[2:36:42] running
[2:36:44] &gt;&gt; cuz one running wasn't enough to express
[2:36:46] what this woman did. She ran through the
[2:36:48] whole town
[2:36:49] &gt;&gt; telling everybody come see a man.
[2:36:52] &gt;&gt; What if I told you that what God did in
[2:36:54] her that day, it's quite similar to the
[2:36:57] work that he's trying to work in us
[2:36:59] &gt;&gt; to make us his corporate Messiah in the
[2:37:02] earth to share his attributes. Let me
[2:37:05] finish this one. Uh, we must live by the
[2:37:08] word because the bride is a part of the
[2:37:10] bridegroom.
[2:37:11] Like any wife is a part of her husband.
[2:37:13] Therefore, we must be the word bride. We
[2:37:15] must be the word bride. We must be the
[2:37:19] word bride. Not just because we feed on
[2:37:22] the word, but because the word is
[2:37:24] represented in us already. If the word
[2:37:27] is already represented in us, guess
[2:37:29] what? We're going to feed on.
[2:37:33] I can tell when someone's reading a
[2:37:35] scripture
[2:37:39] whether it's more like a book of poetry
[2:37:41] to them or living drops
[2:37:45] of living life
[2:37:47] &gt;&gt; living moving breathing God. You can
[2:37:50] tell when someone's reading a scripture
[2:37:53] whether it's foreign
[2:37:56] or whether it's who they are.
[2:37:58] &gt;&gt; The manifestation. What is the word
[2:38:00] bride? the manifestation of this hour,
[2:38:03] the bride, not a creed or denomination,
[2:38:05] but a living oracle of God. Do you know
[2:38:08] what it means to be a living oracle of
[2:38:09] God? Oracle is a word or one who speaks
[2:38:11] a word. A living oracle of God, a living
[2:38:16] attribute of God, displaying to the
[2:38:19] world. This is where I wanted to hone
[2:38:21] in, but I won't be able to do it this
[2:38:22] morning. But this is what I wanted to
[2:38:24] hone in on. Displaying to the world the
[2:38:27] attributes of God in the formation of
[2:38:30] the bride. that's to be expressed in
[2:38:32] this hour that we're living in. And then
[2:38:34] this important last uh little paragraph,
[2:38:38] Martin Luther could not
[2:38:44] express the attributes
[2:38:46] that we express.
[2:38:49] Did you know there's never been an hour
[2:38:53] where all the attributes could be
[2:38:55] expressed like this hour? Amen.
[2:39:00] &gt;&gt; It couldn't happen under Luther
[2:39:03] &gt;&gt; and it couldn't happen under Wesley
[2:39:05] &gt;&gt; and it couldn't even happen under the
[2:39:08] glossalia and exusia of Pentecost
[2:39:13] &gt;&gt; because the word was being restored.
[2:39:16] The word was being filled up again. But
[2:39:19] we live in the hour where the word has
[2:39:21] been
[2:39:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:22] &gt;&gt; Somebody say has been.
[2:39:23] &gt;&gt; Has been.
[2:39:24] &gt;&gt; The word has been restored. And because
[2:39:27] the word has been restored, we can not
[2:39:29] only express the attributes of this
[2:39:31] church age, but we have the grace to
[2:39:35] express the attributes of Christ that
[2:39:37] were sent to every one of the church
[2:39:40] ages.
[2:39:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:42] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:39:43] &gt;&gt; Which which puts us in the stature
[2:39:46] of the perfect man. The perfect the
[2:39:49] perfect one.
[2:39:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:51] &gt;&gt; Puts us in that process, in that
[2:39:53] building, in that adoption. but a living
[2:39:55] oracle of God, a living attribute of
[2:39:57] God, displaying to the world the
[2:39:59] attributes of God in the formation of
[2:40:02] the bride that's to be expressed
[2:40:05] in this hour that we're now living.
[2:40:06] Martin Luther could not express the
[2:40:08] attributes that we express because that
[2:40:10] was in the beginning, the resurrection,
[2:40:12] like the corn of wheat that went into
[2:40:16] the earth. And Wesley his age, he could
[2:40:20] not express beyond his age. and
[2:40:24] Pentecost
[2:40:26] could not express beyond its given and
[2:40:30] appointed time.
[2:40:32] I don't know what you believe, but I
[2:40:34] believe we're in the last of the last
[2:40:35] days. I believe if you're more
[2:40:37] comfortable warming a pew than
[2:40:40] displaying his attributes to a lost and
[2:40:42] dying world,
[2:40:43] &gt;&gt; I think that you're more like church.
[2:40:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:48] &gt;&gt; Than you realize.
[2:40:50] &gt;&gt; And that's not the goal. The goal is to
[2:40:52] be like the husband.
[2:40:57] &gt;&gt; And if that's the case, this is what I
[2:40:59] was wanting to get to but didn't, but I
[2:41:02] will.
[2:41:03] If that's the case, then Mark 16 is not
[2:41:08] an option.
[2:41:11] Oh, you don't know Mark 16?
[2:41:18] This is on you. This extension is on
[2:41:21] you.
[2:41:24] It's your fault. Don't blame me.
[2:41:27] If your roast is burnt,
[2:41:30] don't blame me.
[2:41:32] Mark 16.
[2:41:35] You know, Scoffield
[2:41:44] went to jail.
[2:41:50] for having a second family.
[2:41:57] I know brother Brandham tells us over
[2:41:59] and over again that he used a Scoffield
[2:42:02] Bible, but I want you to know that a lot
[2:42:03] of people are way off track because
[2:42:06] they've been reading the footnotes
[2:42:09] instead of depending on the Holy Spirit.
[2:42:14] and he was not a good man.
[2:42:18] Don't do much research.
[2:42:21] You'll be really sad. Does that mean God
[2:42:23] couldn't use him? No, it doesn't. God
[2:42:26] could use him,
[2:42:28] but it certainly means I'm not going to
[2:42:29] take his interpretation of anything.
[2:42:33] &gt;&gt; All them notes that he wrote in the
[2:42:35] bottom, I'm not I'm not going to I'm not
[2:42:37] going to base my life on the fact that
[2:42:38] he's not sure whether or not Mark 16 is
[2:42:41] inspired or not.
[2:42:46] And when I first come around the message
[2:42:47] people, I heard them preaching from the
[2:42:49] pullpit that that this was we had no
[2:42:51] proof that this was inspired. Let me
[2:42:53] tell you how you prove anything.
[2:42:56] It it's in the it's the proving is is in
[2:42:59] the pudding.
[2:43:02] &gt;&gt; That's how you know if it's a decent
[2:43:04] pudding or not. You you taste it.
[2:43:07] &gt;&gt; And and let me ask you a question. Did
[2:43:09] the early church cast out devils in his
[2:43:12] name? Amen.
[2:43:13] &gt;&gt; Did they speak with new tongues?
[2:43:15] &gt;&gt; Did they take up serpents? They did.
[2:43:17] &gt;&gt; Did they drink any deadly thing? Yeah.
[2:43:19] And it didn't hurt them, right?
[2:43:21] &gt;&gt; And did they lay hands on the sick and
[2:43:23] they recover?
[2:43:24] &gt;&gt; It's inspired.
[2:43:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:27] &gt;&gt; How do you know? Because that's what
[2:43:28] they did.
[2:43:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:31] &gt;&gt; Go tell John. It's real simple.
[2:43:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "Go ye into all the world and
[2:43:36] preach the gospel to every creature.
[2:43:38] &gt;&gt; He that believeth and is baptized shall
[2:43:40] be saved." Amen.
[2:43:41] &gt;&gt; But he that believeth not shall be
[2:43:42] damned. And these signs and these signs
[2:43:45] and these signs and these signs.
[2:43:49] &gt;&gt; This is what I've been wrestling with
[2:43:50] God about now for several months.
[2:43:55] And these signs shall follow them that
[2:43:58] believe.
[2:44:00] &gt;&gt; If you think that's plain, Brother
[2:44:02] Brandon was planer. He said if the signs
[2:44:04] don't follow you, you don't believe.
[2:44:08] &gt;&gt; Now, is that plain?
[2:44:10] And I'm wrestling with that because I
[2:44:13] don't see the signs following my life.
[2:44:17] &gt;&gt; That once followed my life
[2:44:20] &gt;&gt; and I want them. Not so I can say I got
[2:44:24] them. No. Or brag to somebody else that
[2:44:27] doesn't have them. But because I want to
[2:44:30] know that I know that I know that I know
[2:44:32] that I believe. Amen.
[2:44:33] &gt;&gt; I want to know that unbelief has been
[2:44:35] ultimately completely and totally
[2:44:36] annihilated from my life.
[2:44:38] &gt;&gt; And I want to know that this little
[2:44:40] bride is in formation.
[2:44:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:44:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:44:44] &gt;&gt; You see, if it had never happened and
[2:44:46] I'd never seen it, I'd probably be as
[2:44:48] satisfied as some folks are today. But
[2:44:50] if you've ever laid hands on the sick
[2:44:52] and watch blind eyes open or deaf ears
[2:44:54] unstopp
[2:44:56] cancerous tumors fall off and roll
[2:44:57] across the floor.
[2:45:01] You ever saw God heal a back and a
[2:45:03] little girl come out of a back brace?
[2:45:05] There's a woman, there's a picture down
[2:45:07] there at the at the fellowship hall of a
[2:45:10] little black woman in a tent in South
[2:45:12] Carolina where we were preaching and
[2:45:14] they wheeled her in a wheelchair. On the
[2:45:16] way out, the spirit of God fell on her
[2:45:19] in in the tent. And on the way out, she
[2:45:22] was pushing her wheelchair
[2:45:24] &gt;&gt; and her family said, "We've not seen
[2:45:25] this. We don't even remember ever mama
[2:45:29] not being in a wheelchair. And here
[2:45:31] she's walking out pushing the
[2:45:33] wheelchair. Why? Because these signs
[2:45:34] shall follow them that believe.
[2:45:37] &gt;&gt; And once you've seen it and experienced
[2:45:39] it, you you want to know, Lord, what's
[2:45:41] wrong with me?
[2:45:43] &gt;&gt; What's wrong with me?
[2:45:45] &gt;&gt; So this is not just on you. This is on
[2:45:47] me. In my name shall they cast out
[2:45:50] devils. They shall speak with new
[2:45:52] tongues.
[2:45:54] They shall take up serpents. I don't
[2:45:56] think this means uh we go to West
[2:45:59] Virginia and handle the rattlesnakes.
[2:46:02] I think this is the book of Acts.
[2:46:04] &gt;&gt; He took up the firewood
[2:46:07] and and a serpent came out of the sticks
[2:46:09] and bit him and and and he just
[2:46:13] my god,
[2:46:15] you know the war dance you do when a
[2:46:17] spider runs across the floor?
[2:46:19] Here's a man with a serpent latched onto
[2:46:21] his hand and he just shakes it off in
[2:46:24] the fire. He's not even afraid. But what
[2:46:26] he didn't know is the legend of the land
[2:46:28] said that there were going to be gods
[2:46:29] come to these people and they were going
[2:46:31] to have power over serpents. So I want
[2:46:34] you to know that in that moment he had a
[2:46:36] very captive audience.
[2:46:38] &gt;&gt; And that's why God does signs. He
[2:46:40] doesn't do them to entertain us.
[2:46:42] &gt;&gt; He does them because there's somebody he
[2:46:43] wants to reach.
[2:46:45] &gt;&gt; Now if you believe that all have been
[2:46:47] reached,
[2:46:49] then there's no need. If they drink any
[2:46:51] deadly thing, it doesn't say they're
[2:46:53] going to go around drinking strict nine
[2:46:55] instead of water, but it said if they
[2:46:58] do, it shall not hurt them, and they
[2:46:59] shall lay hands on the sick.
[2:47:03] I know of a time in my life where I saw
[2:47:06] more healed than not.
[2:47:12] If he ever did that,
[2:47:16] he still can.
[2:47:19] It seems like now that a real manifested
[2:47:22] healing is
[2:47:24] an instantaneous or miraculous healing
[2:47:26] is is by far the exception.
[2:47:30] But I know there was a time that it was
[2:47:32] the expectation.
[2:47:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:37] I don't mean to depress you,
[2:47:40] but I just want you to know it may be
[2:47:42] because we're not fully aware of what
[2:47:45] this is to be the corporate Messiah.
[2:47:52] I want us to get it.
[2:47:54] &gt;&gt; It's very important.
[2:47:56] &gt;&gt; Let's stand. Thank you for your
[2:47:58] patience. It's been a little rough
[2:47:59] getting it out, but thank you. Thank
[2:48:01] you. Thank you. Thank you for your
[2:48:03] patience.
[2:48:06] when I I mean I got so I've got three
[2:48:09] series going here at one time, but uh I
[2:48:11] want to finish the others if I live long
[2:48:13] enough.
[2:48:15] But before I'm done with this one, I
[2:48:17] want to talk about
[2:48:19] the transition between a Moses
[2:48:21] commission and a Joshua commission.
[2:48:24] And I think that a lot of the believers
[2:48:26] of this end time message are quite
[2:48:28] confused.
[2:48:33] I I I don't think they really fully
[2:48:35] understand
[2:48:37] that
[2:48:39] brother Brandham was commissioned in a
[2:48:42] Moses capacity
[2:48:44] from a cabin or a cave. And then later
[2:48:49] he was commissioned from Joshua chapter
[2:48:52] 1
[2:48:53] for a portion of a Joshua commission. He
[2:48:57] could be a portion of a Moses commission
[2:49:00] and a portion of a Joshua commission.
[2:49:02] It's absolutely biblical
[2:49:05] for one one person to rise fulfilling
[2:49:08] portions of types,
[2:49:12] not entirety of types, but portions of
[2:49:15] types. But if brother Brandham was only
[2:49:18] commissioned with a portion a generation
[2:49:19] ago with a portion of the Joshua
[2:49:23] commission,
[2:49:25] then there has to be
[2:49:28] people somebody's
[2:49:31] &gt;&gt; who have a desire to understand the
[2:49:33] fulfillment.
[2:49:34] &gt;&gt; What's the second installment? Because
[2:49:36] we're not there yet.
[2:49:38] I know they try to say we're there,
[2:49:41] &gt;&gt; but this today looks awful lot like
[2:49:43] yesterday looked.
[2:49:46] &gt;&gt; Which looked a whole lot like the day
[2:49:47] before.
[2:49:50] &gt;&gt; To inherit means to inherit.
[2:49:53] &gt;&gt; To cross over means to cross over.
[2:49:56] &gt;&gt; And he said, "And I'm not talking about
[2:49:57] the millennium."
[2:49:59] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm talking about the full
[2:50:01] powers of heaven
[2:50:02] &gt;&gt; invested in a little body of believers."
[2:50:04] Yes, sir.
[2:50:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's what I'm talking about
[2:50:06] is a promised land or a place of rest or
[2:50:09] a crossing over." So, there has to be a
[2:50:12] company
[2:50:13] because there's no room for a one-man
[2:50:15] ministry anymore because Moses was
[2:50:18] commissioned as one, and then 70
[2:50:20] followed.
[2:50:22] &gt;&gt; Jesus won,
[2:50:25] 120 plus followed. So then as we come to
[2:50:29] an end of a one-man ministry era, it
[2:50:31] can't be one man again commissioned to
[2:50:33] finish the race of Moses, the
[2:50:35] commission, excuse me, the commission of
[2:50:37] Joshua. It has to be a many membered
[2:50:39] body. It's a corporate messiah. It's a
[2:50:42] corporate anointing.
[2:50:43] &gt;&gt; And it's not going to fall on people who
[2:50:45] don't want it.
[2:50:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:50:46] &gt;&gt; Or who are not even concerned about it.
[2:50:48] &gt;&gt; It's only going to come to those who are
[2:50:50] willing to pursue it.
[2:50:51] &gt;&gt; And it's not an it.
[2:50:53] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:50:54] &gt;&gt; It's a full manifestation of him. I got
[2:50:56] loved ones who need miracles.
[2:51:02] &gt;&gt; We lost one this week. But I I I'm not
[2:51:05] giving up on miracles.
[2:51:08] &gt;&gt; I've got loved ones who need miracles.
[2:51:10] Maybe you do.
[2:51:11] &gt;&gt; There are people in this room today that
[2:51:13] need miracles. There's people streaming
[2:51:15] this s. It's not all about miracles, not
[2:51:17] all about signs, not all about wonders.
[2:51:20] But he said, "If you are that, if you're
[2:51:22] that and that is in you,
[2:51:25] &gt;&gt; then the then the signs of Mark 16,
[2:51:28] &gt;&gt; it is necessary that they follow you
[2:51:30] where you go."
[2:51:32] &gt;&gt; And and I'm about to the place where if
[2:51:34] it can't go with me, I don't want to go.
[2:51:38] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:51:39] &gt;&gt; No wonder Moses said, "I don't even want
[2:51:42] to go if you're not going before me."
[2:51:46] &gt;&gt; Why do we go? We don't go to go. We go
[2:51:49] to demonstrate. Amen.
[2:51:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:51:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:51:52] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said, "These things
[2:51:53] are the demonstrations of the
[2:51:55] resurrection." And he said, "The bride
[2:51:57] church is called to be demonstrators of
[2:51:59] the resurrection of Christ." We go
[2:52:01] proving. We go proving that Christ is
[2:52:03] risen
[2:52:04] &gt;&gt; by faith.
[2:52:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:52:06] &gt;&gt; Someone tells you their heartache and
[2:52:08] you say, "Oh my, I'm so sorry. I'm so
[2:52:10] sorry. I'm so sorry." You're not
[2:52:12] demonstrating the resurrection. You're
[2:52:13] demonstrating a sympathetic ear. You're
[2:52:16] demonstrating the resurrection when you
[2:52:18] say right out there in the frozen uh
[2:52:21] frozen uh department uh section, frozen
[2:52:24] section of Walmart and and you're
[2:52:26] hearing their sob story and you Yes.
[2:52:29] Yes. Oh, I'm so sorry. And you say, "How
[2:52:31] about we pray right now?"
[2:52:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:52:34] &gt;&gt; Because Jesus is alive and well. Hebrews
[2:52:37] 13:8, Mark 16,
[2:52:41] &gt;&gt; proving himself in his people.
[2:52:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then you're demonstrating,
[2:52:46] &gt;&gt; the attributes of the resurrection. Bow
[2:52:48] your head with me just a moment. Father,
[2:52:51] I I've drugged this out. Um I it is my
[2:52:55] tendency. I can't deny. Uh but it comes
[2:52:58] from a desire
[2:53:00] &gt;&gt; not just to be heard.
[2:53:02] &gt;&gt; But it comes from a desire that you, oh
[2:53:04] Christ, living word, anointed one, that
[2:53:08] you would be manifested in all of us.
[2:53:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:53:12] And I don't mean on occasion like that
[2:53:14] anointing that comes and goes. I mean
[2:53:16] like the abiding occupying
[2:53:20] divine presence of God that lives inside
[2:53:23] of a believer.
[2:53:25] I want uh I want mas to have it and
[2:53:28] daddies to have it and I want children
[2:53:31] to operate in the glory.
[2:53:33] I've seen what happens when little
[2:53:35] children come under the power
[2:53:39] and to begin to lay hands on one another
[2:53:42] and begin to dream dreams and see angels
[2:53:44] and have experiences with God.
[2:53:49] I've seen what happens when when we can
[2:53:52] surrender and the pillar of fire comes
[2:53:54] among us not to be a entertainment but
[2:53:58] to be a an encouragement
[2:54:02] &gt;&gt; to keep displaying
[2:54:04] the works and attributes of the
[2:54:06] resurrection.
[2:54:08] I I just sense in my heart Lord that uh
[2:54:12] there's more that you want to show.
[2:54:15] there's more that you want to express.
[2:54:17] And uh I'm almost sometimes I feel sorry
[2:54:21] that that we're all you got.
[2:54:26] But you knew all of that when you let it
[2:54:29] wind up this way.
[2:54:32] When you let so many fall by the way and
[2:54:35] run in other directions and deny that
[2:54:37] Mark 16 is even inspired for this day.
[2:54:41] You knew what you were going to end up
[2:54:42] with at the end. and and we're part of
[2:54:44] that
[2:54:46] that rag tag army
[2:54:49] like David's chosen.
[2:54:51] And Lord, if you can use anything,
[2:54:55] you can use us.
[2:54:57] If you can make a donkey talk and an axe
[2:55:00] head swim,
[2:55:04] you can certainly use us.
[2:55:07] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[2:55:10] I love there's so many things I wanted
[2:55:12] to share with the people today.
[2:55:15] All the many times you talked about the
[2:55:17] mistakes of Moses
[2:55:20] and how that they did not affect
[2:55:23] your love, your connection to Moses.
[2:55:28] just caused you to put more in a Joshua
[2:55:34] who could take them all the way.
[2:55:45] We were told that Moses represents the
[2:55:47] law.
[2:55:50] Your prophet preached that Joshua was
[2:55:52] grace.
[2:55:57] We can't uh take the promised land with
[2:56:01] only a Moses mentality.
[2:56:04] We've got to see the champion.
[2:56:08] We've got to see the Joshua champion.
[2:56:13] Lord, we are depending on you.
[2:56:17] While some strive to see just how phony
[2:56:19] they can be, there's a little bride in
[2:56:22] this earth who wants only the genuine.
[2:56:24] And some people use church like a
[2:56:26] opportunity to show off an outfit. But
[2:56:29] there are a people
[2:56:32] who really want to get the most out of
[2:56:35] every time we gather. Here we are today.
[2:56:37] Lord Jesus, would you let this truth go
[2:56:40] out over the airwaves today and reach uh
[2:56:43] candidates, reach reach potentials
[2:56:46] who are willing to let you take the
[2:56:48] preeminences in their life. In just a
[2:56:51] moment, would you fill up this altar for
[2:56:53] a few moments? worshippers who who
[2:56:55] recognize that if there's ever going to
[2:56:57] be a day, it's got to be now. If there's
[2:56:59] ever going to be a time, it's got to be
[2:57:01] now. If there's ever going to be a
[2:57:03] surrendered army, it's got to be us.
[2:57:04] It's got to be now.
[2:57:06] &gt;&gt; Would you just fill up the front of this
[2:57:08] place with those who just say, "Yes,
[2:57:10] Lord. Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord." I hear them
[2:57:12] blasting on the Christian satellite
[2:57:14] radio the song sometime, uh, you just
[2:57:17] need a greater yes, Lord. I just want to
[2:57:20] be that greater yes. Yes.
[2:57:23] &gt;&gt; I want my yes to be a greater yes.
[2:57:26] &gt;&gt; Meaning a greater surrender.
[2:57:29] &gt;&gt; I want my neighbors changed.
[2:57:32] &gt;&gt; I want them to see the power of God that
[2:57:35] it is alive and well. That you have not
[2:57:38] diminished even in this hour of Satan's
[2:57:40] Eden. Your power, your authority, and
[2:57:43] your love for human mankind has not
[2:57:46] diminished.
[2:57:48] So we surrender
[2:57:53] precious Jesus in your name.
[2:58:02] There's nothing worth more
[2:58:06] that will ever come close.
[2:58:10] Nothing can compare.
[2:58:14] You're our living home. Oh,
[2:58:22] your presence,
[2:58:24] Lord,

[2:58:52] by your presence,

[3:06:11] Not just church, your goodness.
[3:06:16] Let us become
[3:06:18] more aware. May we become more state in
[3:06:21] action. Let us experience
[3:06:25] the glory of your goodness.
[3:06:30] Let us become
[3:06:32] more aware of your presence. Let the
[3:06:36] cadence of an army rise. It's the glory
[3:06:40] of your empire.

[3:07:12] And let us become more aware of your
[3:07:17] presence.
[3:07:20] Let us experience
[3:07:22] the glory of your good.
[3:07:27] &gt;&gt; Holy
[3:07:28] Spirit, you are
[3:07:31] &gt;&gt; here. Show him where
[3:07:36] &gt;&gt; this place.
[3:07:38] &gt;&gt; This place
[3:07:40] &gt;&gt; sitting in the living room. Fill this
[3:07:42] place
[3:07:45] &gt;&gt; riding down the highway. Fill this place
[3:07:50] over
[3:07:53] by your presence.
[3:08:01] the deepest reality
[3:08:03] of what we're sharing this morning.
[3:08:07] It may pass you by.
[3:08:12] It does many.
[3:08:14] They can't hear it. They can't see it.
[3:08:18] They can't feel a connection to it. But
[3:08:22] I believe the majority of people in this
[3:08:24] room are here because you've had a
[3:08:28] connection to it.
[3:08:30] If you wanted church as usual, you'd
[3:08:33] find you a 12:00 getting out church and
[3:08:35] that's where you'd plant yourself.
[3:08:38] I believe you're here not because this
[3:08:41] is just all perfect, but I believe
[3:08:43] you're here because you know the
[3:08:45] potential
[3:08:46] &gt;&gt; for God to show up is here.
[3:08:49] &gt;&gt; Because we're not going to keep him in a
[3:08:50] box to satisfy anybody's definition of
[3:08:55] what a message church is supposed to be.
[3:09:00] I don't care what it's supposed to be. I
[3:09:03] don't get my model from looking at the
[3:09:05] others. I get my model from that book.
[3:09:09] &gt;&gt; And it says these signs shall follow
[3:09:11] them that believe. And I don't believe
[3:09:13] it's just the preachers that he's
[3:09:15] talking to. I believe he's talking to
[3:09:17] believers. I believe mama ought to be
[3:09:19] able to pick up a fevered child and lay
[3:09:21] her arms, roll her arms around her baby
[3:09:25] and say, "In the name of Jesus Christ,
[3:09:28] go to the root of this infirmity and
[3:09:30] take your hands off of my child."
[3:09:35] &gt;&gt; Nobody even knows.
[3:09:38] &gt;&gt; It doesn't make it to the magazine. It's
[3:09:39] not in the headlines. But God is
[3:09:42] glorified
[3:09:43] &gt;&gt; because somebody took him at his word.
[3:09:46] Don't you want to be that kind of mama?
[3:09:48] Don't you want to be that kind of
[3:09:49] person? You don't have Listen. Listen.
[3:09:53] &gt;&gt; If you're still a person that has to be
[3:09:56] credited and thanked
[3:09:58] &gt;&gt; for everything you do,
[3:10:00] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[3:10:01] &gt;&gt; You're not going anywhere in the spirit.
[3:10:05] &gt;&gt; And there's a part of that alive in most
[3:10:07] all of us.
[3:10:08] &gt;&gt; I said us.
[3:10:10] &gt;&gt; We say we don't need it, but we're
[3:10:13] human. And there's a part of us that
[3:10:15] wants that little bit of acknowledgement
[3:10:18] for what we did.
[3:10:21] &gt;&gt; And when we get locked in that mode,
[3:10:24] we'll never be able to operate Mark 16
[3:10:26] the way we're ordained to do it.
[3:10:29] &gt;&gt; Because those believers have signs
[3:10:31] following them. And it becomes not
[3:10:33] common in the sense of unsacred,
[3:10:36] but common in the sense of another
[3:10:38] typical day in the life of a child of
[3:10:40] God.
[3:10:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you're in that mode, you
[3:10:44] can do it. You don't have to tell
[3:10:46] everybody at church about it.
[3:10:48] &gt;&gt; You don't have to put it on Facebook.
[3:10:51] &gt;&gt; You can if you feel like you should. But
[3:10:54] all you need is for the Lord to know,
[3:10:56] &gt;&gt; I've put my faith in action today and
[3:10:59] you've moved.
[3:11:00] &gt;&gt; If you're doing it to build yourself a
[3:11:02] little ministry or to build some little
[3:11:04] reputation, you'll just stay right where
[3:11:06] you are.
[3:11:08] But if you just want to make him famous,
[3:11:10] &gt;&gt; Lord, I just want your name to be famous
[3:11:12] again.
[3:11:14] &gt;&gt; I want people to know that it's not a
[3:11:16] just a dryeyed kind of relationship, but
[3:11:18] there's a people alive with your
[3:11:20] presence
[3:11:21] &gt;&gt; in these last days. I feel really good
[3:11:23] right now. Felt felt a little weary a
[3:11:25] few minutes ago, but I feel really good
[3:11:27] right now because I believe somebody's
[3:11:29] faith is reaching up to him. I just want
[3:11:32] to quickly say this before we before we
[3:11:34] move, and that is this. If you're one of
[3:11:37] those persons
[3:11:39] like my dad
[3:11:41] who just kept trying to fill the void.
[3:11:45] [Music]
[3:11:51] You see it all the time. You see you see
[3:11:53] people in town.
[3:11:59] Wasn't enough to have two or three in
[3:12:00] each ear. Then they then they got to put
[3:12:02] one in their lip and they got to put one
[3:12:04] in their nose and they got to put one in
[3:12:07] their
[3:12:12] I'm so sorry. It nauseates me not
[3:12:15] because of the way it looks but because
[3:12:18] of how it represents
[3:12:20] such a bondage in slavery.
[3:12:25] and one one tattoo, one that is not
[3:12:28] enough. And they just have to keep on
[3:12:30] and on and on. It gets higher up the
[3:12:32] neck. And it just it breaks my heart
[3:12:34] because I recognize they're just looking
[3:12:37] for
[3:12:39] acceptance. They're looking for
[3:12:41] validation
[3:12:43] and they just need to meet a a Mark 16
[3:12:47] bunch of people
[3:12:48] &gt;&gt; who don't care about all that
[3:12:51] &gt;&gt; who just want to show them Jesus
[3:12:54] &gt;&gt; not with words
[3:12:56] &gt;&gt; but with evidences of the resurrection.
[3:12:59] If you're here today or you're listening
[3:13:01] to this service, watching this service,
[3:13:04] and you're one who keeps trying to fill
[3:13:06] life
[3:13:07] with a bigger bigger house or a faster
[3:13:10] car or for crying out loud, a grown man
[3:13:13] racing little go-karts.
[3:13:19] Nothing wrong with any of that perhaps,
[3:13:20] but it don't satisfy for very long.
[3:13:24] &gt;&gt; I want you to know there is something
[3:13:26] that satisfies.
[3:13:27] There's someone that'll satisfy.
[3:13:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:13:30] &gt;&gt; While while we're not looking around, if
[3:13:32] there's anybody that says, "I really
[3:13:34] need him to come and fill up every empty
[3:13:36] spot in my life." You just slip up your
[3:13:38] hand. I've still got some empty places.
[3:13:40] God bless every hand in the room. Every
[3:13:42] hand in the room. I've still got empty
[3:13:45] places that I need him to come. Lord,
[3:13:47] I'm asking you right now with the
[3:13:49] seriousness of faith. You saw every hand
[3:13:53] that went up
[3:13:55] and and and it just simply said, "I've
[3:13:57] got some empty spots that I need Jesus
[3:13:59] to come and fill. I've tried to fill
[3:14:01] them with other things." Lord, this is
[3:14:03] your invitation.
[3:14:06] &gt;&gt; If they really meant it, you know it.
[3:14:08] You know their heart. And I'm asking you
[3:14:10] to encounter them, Lord. Not just in
[3:14:13] this moment, but in this week and moving
[3:14:16] forward. come and take up th those slack
[3:14:19] places and fill empty spots and and
[3:14:23] longing voids
[3:14:26] for validation and acceptance. Come and
[3:14:29] fill up those spots
[3:14:31] &gt;&gt; until we can be whole again.
[3:14:34] &gt;&gt; Lord, you're coming for a whole people.
[3:14:36] You sent your word to complete a people.
[3:14:39] &gt;&gt; Fill up all those little places in us
[3:14:43] &gt;&gt; with more of who you are. We surrender
[3:14:46] right now.
[3:14:47] We surrender. We surrender. We
[3:14:50] surrender. We surrender to you right
[3:14:53] now.
[3:14:56] &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit, you're welcome to come and
[3:14:58] take full possession occupation
[3:15:02] of every want, every desire of our lives
[3:15:06] even now. Jesus,
[3:15:08] &gt;&gt; Jesus, Jesus.
[3:15:13] [Music]
[3:15:14] &gt;&gt; Lord, you're the healer. come and heal.
[3:15:17] Come right now and heal bodies. Heal
[3:15:19] bodies.
[3:15:21] &gt;&gt; Restore
[3:15:23] bodies in the name of Jesus Christ.
[3:15:26] Let peace return
[3:15:30] all that has come to disturb. Let your
[3:15:34] peace come and reign and rule in our
[3:15:36] hearts.
[3:15:38] &gt;&gt; More than life itself, we want your
[3:15:41] perfect will in the name of Jesus
[3:15:43] Christ.
[3:15:45] for just a moment. If you feel it's
[3:15:47] appropriate, touch the person next to
[3:15:50] you. Father, you see the need.
[3:15:54] I don't have to know what the need is to
[3:15:57] know that you're a big enough God.
[3:16:01] There are enough promises in your word
[3:16:04] to meet that need.
[3:16:07] I believe there's no better way to
[3:16:08] approach it than the prayers of the
[3:16:10] saints, the faith of of people who love.
[3:16:15] I ask you right now, Jesus.
[3:16:18] Come and be Jesus.
[3:16:21] Maybe there's a broken heart here. Come
[3:16:23] and be Jesus.
[3:16:25] Come and be Jesus.
[3:16:35] Come and take up all the slack.
[3:16:39] Fill every empty spot.
[3:16:41] Sweep out every corner.
[3:16:45] Remove every cobweb.
[3:16:47] Come and occupy with light. Your light.
[3:16:51] Your light. Come and fill up every every
[3:16:53] little spot
[3:16:57] as only you can. Jesus.
[3:17:02] Holy Spirit,
[3:17:05] you are welcome.
[3:17:09] Come
[3:17:11] place and fill the atmosphere.
[3:17:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:17:16] &gt;&gt; Your glory,
[3:17:19] God is what our hearts long for. to be
[3:17:25] overcome
[3:17:28] by your presence.
[3:17:30] Lord,
[3:17:32] Holy
[3:17:34] Spirit, you are welcome
[3:17:38] here. Come flood this place and fill the
[3:17:44] atmosphere.
[3:17:47] Your glory,
[3:17:49] God, is what our hearts long for. To be
[3:17:55] overcome
[3:17:57] [Music]
[3:17:58] by your presence,
[3:18:01] Lord,
[3:18:04] [Music]
[3:18:08] your presence,
[3:18:11] Lord.
[3:18:14] [Music]
[3:18:19] And there's
[3:18:21] more.
[3:18:21] &gt;&gt; Why don't you just turn to somebody,
[3:18:25] &gt;&gt; express some love quickly, hug a neck,
[3:18:27] shake a hand,
[3:18:30] you're our living home.
[3:18:35] &gt;&gt; We have a baby dedication.
[3:18:38] &gt;&gt; Your presence,
[3:18:40] Lord.
[3:18:43] Cuz
[3:18:49] I've tasted and seen
[3:18:52] of the sweetest of love.
[3:18:55] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[3:18:57] &gt;&gt; If you have to go, we understand.
[3:19:02] &gt;&gt; But we have some twins
[3:19:08] that we want to hand back to the Lord.
[3:19:13] for his use.
[3:19:20] Praise God.
[3:19:23] Let's go ahead and and get them up this
[3:19:28] way and let the family come. We'll
[3:19:32] bring a mic down. Somebody, would you
[3:19:36] just be seated a moment if you if you
[3:19:38] have to go? I don't want to I don't want
[3:19:40] to hold you longer, but it was about to
[3:19:43] be real long because we had uh we Hey,
[3:19:47] darling.
[3:19:49] We were going to have three babies to
[3:19:52] dedicate today, but uh
[3:19:56] some are missing from the from little
[3:19:59] Abel's family that they really wanted to
[3:20:02] be here and his was scheduled today. And
[3:20:06] then it just worked out that everybody
[3:20:08] could be here.
[3:20:13] This is my assistant.
[3:20:15] You see her here.
[3:20:17] And uh so we get to do a double double
[3:20:22] decker double duty here. And we're very
[3:20:25] thankful.
[3:20:27] So thankful.
[3:20:29] Uh there was a bit of a bit of a tragedy
[3:20:32] in Sister Laurel's family this week with
[3:20:35] a little baby and it really really
[3:20:37] really pricricked my heart because I was
[3:20:41] thinking, you know, to have a little
[3:20:44] baby born and then it go through so many
[3:20:46] things and then and then leave after mom
[3:20:50] and dad have stood over it and hoped and
[3:20:52] prayed. That's hard, folks, isn't it?
[3:20:55] And the reason why I bring it up at such
[3:20:57] a happy time is simply because after I,
[3:21:01] you know, just cried out to God to
[3:21:03] comfort the family, to please wrap your
[3:21:05] arms, Lord, around them, my next thought
[3:21:08] was was Luke and Megan and how they
[3:21:12] diligently
[3:21:14] watched over that little fellow in that
[3:21:17] incubator or not incubator, sorry, I
[3:21:20] know better than that. Life support
[3:21:22] really.
[3:21:24] um the light and the and the for a while
[3:21:27] the breathing and the feeding and all
[3:21:30] all
[3:21:32] critical
[3:21:34] but God worked a miracle. I thought how
[3:21:36] terrible it would have been at the end
[3:21:38] of that if they had only brought one
[3:21:40] home. But the marvelous grace of God,
[3:21:46] that redemption that he promised,
[3:21:49] he really meant it. He meant he was
[3:21:52] going to do it and he did it double.
[3:21:55] And we have today Hadasa Joy. Is that
[3:21:59] right?
[3:22:01] And Isaac Luke, is that right?
[3:22:05] Well, I had a little help.
[3:22:09] Uh, I'm gonna try.
[3:22:12] Let's see.
[3:22:16] My grandmother was a twin, so I ought to
[3:22:18] be able to hold twins, right? Does that
[3:22:20] Does that mean anything? Okay, now Oh.
[3:22:25] Oh. Oh. Oh.
[3:22:28] Oh, we don't want it.
[3:22:32] Oh my goodness. This is my first
[3:22:39] start grunting now. They don't want to
[3:22:41] see the backs of y'all.
[3:22:44] Look at this.
[3:22:49] Oh, that's a lot of diapers.
[3:22:58] We need to pray.
[3:23:02] Don't you think one of them ought to
[3:23:03] favor Megan a little bit? Little more.
[3:23:07] Do they both have to be Yovich's?
[3:23:11] It's Luke. But I tell you, man, it's
[3:23:13] really I see granddaddy.
[3:23:17] Nothing wrong with that. But at least
[3:23:19] the girl you you ought to at least work
[3:23:22] on looking like mama a little more.
[3:23:26] Ain't this amazing?
[3:23:28] Did you get me? Did you get all them in
[3:23:31] the background?
[3:23:35] Are y'all smiling now?
[3:23:41] It's It's almost like you're just
[3:23:43] holding one, though.
[3:23:45] weightwise.
[3:23:49] Oh, thank you, Lord.
[3:23:52] Let's pray.
[3:23:54] Father, our hearts are so grateful
[3:23:57] today.
[3:24:00] You've got such a big plan and we are so
[3:24:03] thankful that you're always right. You
[3:24:06] never make a mistake. Everything you do
[3:24:09] is perfect, including these precious
[3:24:12] little gifts of life. Lord, thank you
[3:24:15] for bringing our precious little
[3:24:18] brother. Thank you for bringing him
[3:24:20] through. Lord, thank you for
[3:24:22] strengthening his lungs. Thank you,
[3:24:25] Father, for taking care of everything
[3:24:27] that needed to be took care of for both
[3:24:29] of them and letting them come home where
[3:24:32] they needed to be. And thank you, Lord.
[3:24:35] They they've sure been to your house a
[3:24:38] lot already. And Father, we just pray
[3:24:40] today that you will protect them. Uh
[3:24:44] there's so much going around these days
[3:24:47] uh sickness and virus and everything.
[3:24:50] Lord, would you just put a great
[3:24:53] protection around them, Jesus?
[3:24:56] &gt;&gt; I pray Lord that you would do that and
[3:24:58] bring greater strength to their bodies.
[3:25:00] said, "I pray Lord that if you should
[3:25:03] tarry long enough that they would have a
[3:25:06] desire for you like their brothers and
[3:25:09] like their brother and sisters,
[3:25:12] Lord, to to read your word and to learn
[3:25:16] of you like their older siblings do. I
[3:25:19] pray, oh God, that it just fall right on
[3:25:21] them and that their desire would be
[3:25:23] toward you. May they be praisers, too.
[3:25:26] May they be worshippers, too. May they
[3:25:29] bring joy to every member of this
[3:25:32] beautiful extended family across the
[3:25:34] front of this church. Lord, would you
[3:25:37] just bless them in every way?
[3:25:42] Daddy is the only one that can give them
[3:25:44] back to you. But but Lord, we stand
[3:25:46] behind him and we stand behind mama and
[3:25:49] we pray Lord that you will provide for
[3:25:52] them their every need so that they can
[3:25:55] be everything that you have called them
[3:25:56] to be to all of these beautiful children
[3:25:59] that you've given them. And Lord, we all
[3:26:02] give them a hard time picking at them.
[3:26:06] But the reality is, I can't speak for
[3:26:09] anybody but myself, but I admire them
[3:26:11] and I I respect them for the way that
[3:26:14] they look after these children. I
[3:26:17] respect Luke as a as a real dad to his
[3:26:20] to his children. I appreciate that so
[3:26:23] much. And Megan is a real mom. And Lord,
[3:26:26] we just thank you for this opportunity
[3:26:29] to stop and tell you how much we love
[3:26:32] you and how much we thank you for these
[3:26:34] little gifts.
[3:26:37] In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray.
[3:26:42] Amen.
[3:26:44] May they be peaceful like this a bunch.
[3:26:48] A lot. Especially when Pat Peps around.
[3:26:52] That's amazing. Look at them.
[3:26:55] Well, I guess we need to move on.
[3:26:58] I don't know about handing them off. I
[3:27:00] don't even know if I can do it.
[3:27:07] We're sorry we're disturbing your lives
[3:27:11] here. Let me get you. Oh, you got it.
[3:27:14] &gt;&gt; Okay, Daddy.
[3:27:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Dear Lord, we just
[3:27:22] thank you for these two.
[3:27:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:27:25] &gt;&gt; Isaac and Hadassa.
[3:27:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[3:27:28] &gt;&gt; Lord, we just thank you for giving them
[3:27:30] to us and
[3:27:32] answering prayers and comfort.
[3:27:35] &gt;&gt; Being with us.
[3:27:37] So much has changed. So, we've come so
[3:27:40] far,
[3:27:41] &gt;&gt; Lord. Just
[3:27:44] want to give them back to you, Lord.
[3:27:46] just
[3:27:48] be in each one of their lives.
[3:27:51] Comfort them and lead and direct and
[3:27:53] guide them throughout each day.
[3:27:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[3:27:56] &gt;&gt; Help them to walk in your perfect will.
[3:27:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[3:28:00] &gt;&gt; Help us to walk in your perfect will,
[3:28:02] Lord. Just give us the strength to bring
[3:28:04] them up and to show them who you are.
[3:28:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:28:10] &gt;&gt; Just speak through them. Speak through
[3:28:12] us.
[3:28:14] &gt;&gt; To them, Lord. Yes.
[3:28:16] &gt;&gt; Just thank you for them. Just give us
[3:28:18] strength. Amen.
[3:28:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, all of y'all, this big,
[3:28:23] beautiful family, turn around and let
[3:28:26] the church see all of you. I don't think
[3:28:28] these uh babies will lack for love or
[3:28:31] attention or somebody to hold them. I I
[3:28:35] hope there'll be as many volunteers when
[3:28:37] it's time to change diapers.
[3:28:40] Isn't that an amazing What a gift.
[3:28:44] Hallelujah.
[3:28:45] [Applause]
[3:28:47] aunts and uncles and cousins and
[3:28:50] grandmothers, grandfathers and great
[3:28:53] uncles and great ants and they're
[3:28:55] blessed. They're blessed. They're
[3:28:58] blessed.
[3:29:00] God bless all of you.
[3:29:02] Praise the Lord. Well, you know what's
[3:29:06] next? Let's sing this as we get ready to
[3:29:09] go.
[3:29:10] [Music]
[3:29:12] God sent his son.
[3:29:19] They called him Jesus.
[3:29:25] He came
[3:29:27] to love.
[3:29:30] Heal and forgive. Heal and forgive.
[3:29:36] [Music]
[3:29:37] He bled and died,
[3:29:42] my God, just to by my pardon.
[3:29:50] Oh, but an empty
[3:29:52] grave is there to prove my Savior
[3:29:59] lives.
[3:30:02] And because
[3:30:04] [Music]
[3:30:08] I can face
[3:30:15] because
[3:30:18] he lives
[3:30:20] all my fear.
[3:30:22] Woo!
[3:30:25] You don't have to carry that
[3:30:28] because
[3:30:30] I know I
[3:30:33] know he holds the future.
[3:30:40] My life. My life.
[3:30:43] [Music]
[3:30:48] because
[3:30:50] he lives.
[3:30:54] And then
[3:30:56] one day
[3:30:58] it's coming.
[3:31:00] I'm going to cross
[3:31:03] the river.
[3:31:06] Oh, I'll fight
[3:31:09] life's final
[3:31:14] war
[3:31:16] with pain.
[3:31:20] And then as death
[3:31:24] woo
[3:31:26] gives way
[3:31:29] to victory.
[3:31:33] I'll see the light.
[3:31:37] Oh, and I'll know

[3:32:37] Lord. Thank you for letting us be
[3:32:38] together today. I ask that you would
[3:32:41] refresh and renew and rest every tired
[3:32:44] body and mind. Let healing be perfected
[3:32:47] in every sickness. And we'll give you
[3:32:50] praise, honor, and glory. Bring us back
[3:32:53] together at the appointed time in the
[3:32:55] precious exalted name of Yeshua, our
[3:32:58] Messiah, the Lord Jesus Christ. We pray.
[3:33:01] The saints said,
[3:33:02] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[3:33:03] &gt;&gt; You're dismissed to go in the lovely
[3:33:05] name of the Lord. 7:00 Tuesday night,
[3:33:08] we'll be here for church. Come, let's
[3:33:11] see what the Lord will do. Tomorrow is
[3:33:14] Paisley, that beautiful little girl from
[3:33:18] that family. Nine, I believe. Paisley,
[3:33:20] are you going to be nine? She's turning
[3:33:23] nine tomorrow. Wednesday, Sister Evelyn
[3:33:25] Fox and these two beautiful girls here,
[3:33:28] their dad, Brother George, has a
[3:33:31] birthday on Wednesday, and he's getting
[3:33:33] older.
[3:33:35] So, we want to lift him up, pray for
[3:33:37] him, wish him a happy birthday. God
[3:33:39] bless you as you leave today.
[3:33:43] I'm glad he lives
[3:33:46] &gt;&gt; because
[3:33:48] he lives.
[3:33:52] All fear
[3:33:54] is gone.
[3:33:58] Bless you. I love you. Cuz I know
[3:34:03] I know he holds
[3:34:08] my future.
[3:34:11] My life is worth the living.
[3:34:17] Just
[3:34:20] &gt;&gt; Oh wow.
