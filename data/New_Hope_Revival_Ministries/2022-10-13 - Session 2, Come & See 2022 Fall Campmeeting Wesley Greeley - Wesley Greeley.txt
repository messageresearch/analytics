will join the anthem singing [Applause] [Music] you're the [Music] reason why we're Living For Your Glory will be the generations [Music] he lifted High foreign [Music] he deserves to be lifted up brother Greeley did such a fine job last night explaining why we sometimes are praying over people in another language It's a Wonderful explanation the spirit of the Lord has been dealing with me today because I know that some of you visitors and some of you streaming the service will have questions about our worship that's all right where we understand that it might be a little unusual for what you're used to I understand that not offended by that at all now don't come in here like a Critic but come in with an open heart one of the questions that we get asked more than anything is what are these flags and rags and all these things that people are waving well I don't wait I don't usually use one myself but I want to read you a portion of scripture how many of you'd like to know whether it's scriptural or not where they don't do it around the message I I didn't ask you what they do around I said let's see what the Bible says let's see what the scriptures say they may be missing out on something in a Song of Solomon or Song of Songs chapter 6 verse 4 in King James it says Thou Art beautiful o my love as tisra calmly as Jerusalem terrible as an army with banners the complete Jewish Bible said you are as beautiful as tertza my love as lovely as yerushalayim but formidable as an army marching under banners so the waving of a banner or a flag is a symbol of strength and might in Psalm 20 and verse 5 it says we will this is Amplified it says we will shout in Triumph at your salvation and victory and in the name of our God we will set up banners may the Lord fulfill all your petitions and in the complete Jewish Bible it says same verse then we will shout for Joy at your Victory and fly our flags in the name of our God in Celebration 40 but but I'll just give you three tonight in Isaiah 62 10 it says go through go through the gates prepare ye the way of the people cast up cast up the highway gather out the stones lift up a standard for the people now that word Stander in the Hebrew is banner and that's why the complete Jewish Bible renders that go on through go on through the gates clear the way for the people build up a highway build it up clear away the stones raise a banner for the peoples so sometimes when you see somebody waving a banner or a flag they are welcoming the Lord to come in and do whatever it is so it may not be your cup of tea you may like orange pickle I might like Darjeeling but it's both tea you don't have to like the flavor of tea that I like I don't have to like the flavor of tea you like but we got to keep it in the Bible isn't that right and so I didn't know so many of you would be doing this tonight but this is what the Lord laid on my heart I want us to sing that again lift him up raise him up in the old church we used to get our hankies out and do what they called a wave offering to the lord it's the same kind of principle it's a flag of surrender sometime and it's a flag of Celebration another time if you don't have a hanky to wave the Bible said I would that men everywhere would lift up holy hands without wrath and without doubt but I don't know about all that dancing David knew about it he said praise the Lord in the dance [Applause] somebody said well I don't know about the drums the Bible says praise the Lord on the high sounding symbols let everything that have breath praise the Lord so use what you have tonight and let's lift him up [Music] he lifted High be lifted High For Your Glory be lifted High oh be lifted High be lifted High [Music] For Your Glory be lifted High you're the Everlasting father you're that old consuming fire you're the reason why we're Living For Your Glory we will be the generation calling down the reign of heaven we will join me as I'm singing [Music] oh Lord [Music] [Applause] or we lift you high [Music] believe [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] be lifted High [Music] ER and higher low [Music] we lifted High be lifting For Your Glory be lifted High oh be lifted High be lifted For Your Glory be lifted High oh [Music] For Your Glory be lifted High oh we live too high in this place oh we live too high in this place oh Lord oh move Among Us Lord oh won't you move Among Us Lord oh we need you God oh we need you Lord come and touch every heart tonight Lord oh Hallelujah [Music] [Music] we wanna see your glory

Hallelujah [Music] use one of those Hallelujah [Music] [Music] [Music] go to work [Music] the Lord is with you don't go back and we will not go down we will not go by the Lord our God [Music] each other [Music] they will not go down [Music] [Music] me and we're not go down [Music] [Music] [Music] stay inside [Music] we will not go down [Music] we will not go down I will not will not go down we will not go down [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] we will not go down in this high I know we will not go down in this house [Music] we bless the Lord [Music] hey man we will not go down in this fight you may be seated for a few moments how many of you know you can't go down when you're marching with the captain of The Host we know that God is with us when you've got the Lord with you you can't go down we can't fall or fail when we do when we slip he picks us up and Carries us on we're pressing on in this hour wonderful job sister Jaya the lord gave her that song and it's a blessing to us hearing it for the first time tonight we want to welcome you here there are some who have joined us and we will just say to all of you thank you thank you so much for being here you are welcome God is moving even after the stream last night God was still moving he was still delivering and setting captives free and we believe that he's going to do even more for us this evening we want the Lord in his word to have preeminence Among Us amen Hallelujah we talk about worship and somebody said well what about Clapping Your Hand that's scriptural clap your hands all you people well it gets too loud well you can always bring your earplugs we're not offended by that you can bring your plugs or turn your hearing aids down whatever you have to do we're not offended by that but he said clap your hands all you people and and Whisper no Shout unto God with a voice of Triumph [Applause] let's just keep it biblical amen amen I tell you David wouldn't fit in a lot of our churches because one day he stripped off his Royal robe right down to his linen if look just a linen tunic and began to dance before the Lord with all of his might there's always going to be someone to despise your praise might be your husband might be your wife might be your preacher there will always be somebody to despise your praise David didn't let it hinder him he said I just got to tell you sweetheart if you don't hold your peace what you've seen today is just the beginning the next time I turn loose I'm really going to turn loose I'm going to praise God because the Ark of the Covenant has been restored to the people and the presence of God is back in the camp the Bible said shouts of Joy ReSound in the tents of the righteous of the Lord the Lord's right arm has done Mighty things for us the Lord's right arm Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah [Applause] you say well well isn't there some emotion in that I sure hope so I sure hope so the prophet said if there's no emotion in your religion it's dead only one thing left to do with that kind of religion bury it you know he told us what a grave is he said it's a rut with both ends kicked out of it and a lot of us have found ourselves in Roots that have really become Graves come on we're laying like Lazarus stinking but there's a voice of Deliverance in our inner there's a voice of Deliverance there's a little voice that's saying little bride arise Lazarus come forth it's your time to sing it's your time to praise him he's wonderful and worthy to be praised would you give something to the Lord tonight is in the way of an offering to support this meeting and the rest of the meeting and may God bless you brother Greeley it's a local minister with us of course associate pastor but we're going to bless him we are not going to let him labor for us these nights without being blessed when he came in last night we had a a basket of goodies for him just like we prepare for the speaker others guest speakers that come in don't you think he's worthy and he deserves something I certainly do so we want to make sure that when the meeting is over that we have blessed him and that the needs of the meeting are met and we know that we had rain today we were very aware of that it's going to be a little wet outside but we're going to be real careful when we leave of course I know there's only one big puddle there at the edge of the tent we're going to dodge the puddle we're going to go under anyway and have fellowship and break bread together after this service is over it might be at 9 30 it might be at 11 30. I don't know when it'll be but sometime before breakfast time we will gather and so you asked the Lord what he would have you to give father we give our praise we give our attention we give our gifts the things that you have placed in our lives we give it back to you we offer it as an offering to you Lord and we understand that there is a law of sowing and reaping so I ask Lord that you would bless every seed that is given tonight toward the work of this meeting there there is no way of putting a value or a price on what God did last night there's no way to say we know that a word a soul is is more valuable than 10 million worlds and so Lord we just ask that you would meet the need and we ask that you would bless back to the giver as your word has said press down shaken together and running over and we'll give you the honor and the glory and the praise for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the Saints said amen well there's a particularly loud amen back there about middle ways behind brother Steve that is my you are you all right with it that is my father-in-law and he has been wait a minute he has been locked up in Canada since 2018. this is the first time we've seen him since 2018. he is like a stall-fed calf that's been LED out of the gate and he feels free he about broke me today when he hugged me he was so happy to be here we're happy to have him and he said do you all hear me on Sunday he said when I'm watching The Stream do y'all hear me hollering we ought to be able to hear him so we want to say poppy brother Whitaker God bless you we're very glad that you're here tonight [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you just shout and holler and do whatever you need to do we're with you amen amen amen all right can we stand again we're going to be sitting maybe for a little while uh let's have two brothers let's have Elias and Austin again to come and hold the offering bag we're going to ask you to bring your offering drop it in we know that some people don't like to walk in front of other people or maybe you're a newcomer here and you might feel a little bit uh intimidated or something there are plenty of children just hand it to a child as they pass by and someone will bring your offering come and give to the Lord let's sing a verse or two if he set me free I'm so glad you set me free oh I'm so glad he did once like a bird in prison I dwelt no freedom from my sorrow I felt but Jesus came and listened to me glory to God he set me free from the gosh he sent me free as he set me free he broke the box of prison for me I'm Glory about my Jesus to see for Glory to God he set me free oh now I am climbing higher each day darkness of night [Music] or he set me free Jesus Set Me Free he broke the bonds of prison for me found my Jesus to see glory to God he set me free now goodbye to sin things that confound none of this world shall turn me around come on baby I'm working and I'm praying too and glory to God [Music] Jesus deceived for Glory to God he said be free [Music] [Applause] you may be seated again thank you brother Daniel for not making Elisha run by herself he's got some Battle Scars he was in my office before the service Elisha was and he's had a fall and he's all bummed up and yet he is running tonight for the Lord just a few Services ago he marched right up here at the end of the service he said pastor I've got a song [Music] so we gave it to him why those children don't know what they're doing listen folks you don't know that you don't know that just cause you're so dry really do you do you do you wanna do you want to teach the children to sit on the seat and look like they've been baptized in pickle juice or do you want to lead them right [Applause] or do you want to lead them you want to lead them to praise I want to lead them to praise you know some of us are having the hardest time getting free I don't want these children I'm proud of my children all of you but we have four natural born children and I'm I'm thankful I'm thankful that they are not intimidated to worship God you can tell by Benjamin's worship leading that he enters in and they sent us a picture Jonathan was it Jonathan had it or sister uh Elita Senate but they sent us a picture of Benjamin when he was just a little boy in his face is just wet with tears and he's entered right into the presence of the Lord is just a wee little one so don't you have very much to say about it and if you do do not have it to say in front of me because I would much rather them begin to soften up so that they don't ever have to take so much time to get set free from religion it's right it's right and some of you know it because you've come from places that are worse than Frozen so anyway that's my two cents I guess I sound like I'm mad I'm not mad I just want them to have their Liberty tonight if it gets too out of line don't you worry I know how to take it down a notch or two but it's going to have to be pretty wild before I do I don't want you judging my praise and I don't want to judge yours you can sit as still as you want to and I'm not going to judge your walk with God I'm not but I want you to have Liberty you've come here you might as well enjoy yourself you know I've been fighting an awful headache today just rebuking it and resisting it it'll go away and try to come back and during during praise and worship when we were singing there at the beginning of Praise I thought you know what I'm not only entering into the presence of the Lord but I'm having fun you know I don't I don't do a lot of fishing and I don't do a lot of hunting and I know that's not very spiritual not to hunt and fish around the message but I don't do a lot of that I don't have many hobbies you know I don't I don't paint I used to do yard work and now it looks like a jungle so I guess I don't do that anymore so I don't I don't I'm not a big ball fan and I I don't do a lot of things to have fun but isn't it a wonderful thought that you can be in the house of God and actually enjoy being there actually enjoy it I I do this word fun because I don't want to offend you but I I was having fun and it was clean fun nobody was telling some old off-colored joke it was clean fun and I'm thankful for it well can you sing after I've said all that you think you can still see [Music] foreign [Music] God [Music] turn it around God

is doing it he is doing it he's he's accelerating us and he's raising us up above what we have been and this scripture keeps coming back to me it keeps coming back to me the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted he has sent me to preach the Deliverance to the captives and the recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord I would like to prophesy to you that 2022 is the acceptable year of the Lord that he invited you to come and see what he would do among us and that he would come and that he would bind up the Brokenhearted there are people whose Hearts have been broken from one issue or another in life and my God is here tonight to heal up the Brokenhearted I Feel That Fire coming but I don't know what to do with but I don't know what broke your heart I don't know what broke you down I don't know what caused you to get in the fix that you may stand or sit here tonight but the holy spirit is calling to you to lift up your hand and say Lord I allow you to heal my broken heart I cannot look inside of you unless by the spirit of discerning of spirits I cannot see inside of you to know what may have broken your heart but I know the Holy Ghost who heals the Broken Heart and he knows how to deliver his children out of all of the bondage that that broken heart has put you in and I would encourage you not to live another moment with a broken heart or the condition that you have suffered because of a broken heart [Music] friends we've been taught for many many years that anxieties and these types of things that deal with our emotions they lead to a physical condition [Music] and some of you sitting here tonight are in a physical condition because a broken heart or a wounded Spirit was never dealt with and so you deal with physical conditions the breaking down of your physical body but I'm here to tell the that the Holy Spirit has come tonight to deliver us out of all of our troubles to Deliver Us from the brokenheartedness to bind up our wounds there are bruises there are bruises among us tonight [Music] around by the enemy and those bruises that you have received have turned into cancerous cells some of them in the natural and some of them in the spiritual and they're leading to your demise they're leading to your death and I'm calling on the Holy Ghost right now calling on the Holy Ghost right now to come and bind up the Brokenhearted and to deliver those that have been bruised in the name of Jesus Christ we declare the acceptable year of the Lord we declare the word of the Lord foreign ah yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] yeah yeah [Music] my God I speak to all the bruising I speak to all the bruising of the past years I speak to all of the bruising in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I decree over my sister that all all of that bruising is leaving her right now the name of Jesus Christ all of the residual of it every time her heart was broken every time she was discouraged every time she was anxious and every time she was fearful and it just added more cells to the bruising God I decree right now that all of the residual of that leave her physical body and our mind your soul there's some the name of Jesus Christ [Music] I I thank you Lord I thank you Lord I Thank You Lord I thank you Lord I thank you Lord breakthrough breakthrough breakthrough [Music] don't let him pass you by don't let him pass you by [Music] just because it may not come the way you think it ought to come don't let him pass you by [Music] the holy spirit's here foreign Lord I decree over this congregation the healing of the Brokenhearted [Music] it has it has led some down a rough and a rocky road [Music] and I am asking you Lord that you will lift them out of the situation that they're in tonight foreign [Music] you have come to heal the brokenhearted Lord [Music] it is not your will that any should perish but that all should come to the knowledge of the truth that should come to repentance Lord I believe it's your will for your elect lady to come to a place where the broken heart is no longer dictating every move that they make causing them to go to continue hurting other people [Music] cause their hearts have been broken they break others hearts because their hearts are broken anger comes out and so Lord I'm asking you right now by the sovereignty of the move of God as you have come in this place and the angels are here and you are walking amongst us that you would go to the Brokenhearted and that you would heal it O Lord that you will bring Deliverance to the captive in the name of Jesus Christ [Music] there are some that are sitting captive this night to fear [Music] there is fear that if you ever let go it's gonna be messy there is fear that you will be held more accountable than you've been in the past there is fear that you will have to straighten up and live a different life but the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost has not given you the spirit of fear [Music] he has come that you could have power and love and a sound mind and so by the power of the Living God I call those that are bound by the spirit of fear in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I call you above up and out of the fear and the intimidation in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Satan you hold them captive no longer [Music] has [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] the grave why wait ye in the grave [Music] why would you continue to reside among the dead when there is life why would you continue you to lay there among the dead when there is life in the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] Satan I say lose them and let them go in the name of Jesus Christ [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I removed the grave close in the name of Jesus Christ [Music] loosome and set them free by the power of the Living God [Music] laughs [Music] can these bones live [Music] can these bones really can they really live they're dry and they're white they don't look like they have any life in them [Music] but when the prophet looked upon them he said Lord you know and then he began to watch as these bones began to get some sinew on them some muscle some tissue [Music] there was no more white of the bones [Music] there was no evidence of the bloody war that had put them in that condition there was no evidence of how they got to get in that graveyard to start with but they began to look like there was something to them [Music] and all of a sudden the ruach of God the glory of God the Breath of God came and got right in that Army he breathed into that Army and it rose up a mighty Army before the Living God [Music] you may feel like a bag of bones tonight as I said you may be feeling bruised and wounded and bloody and torn and it feels like that you have no energy left you I feel like that you have nothing left to give but the ruach the breath of the Holy Ghost is here in the house tonight to breathe in you the Breath of Life foreign [Music] in the name of Jesus Christ [Music] you may say preacher I really want what you're talking about [Music] I really would like to have what you're talking about but I don't feel a thing [Music] well I would like to inform you that this is not about feelings I would like to inform you that you have been called as the Seed of Abraham and Abraham walked day by day by day and he could not see the promise before him it looked like that his body was as good as dead and Sarah's was as well but one day El Shaddai came by one day the spirit of God dropped in and where there appeared to be no life you see Abraham had to put one step in front of the other and it was a walk of Faith there was really no feeling to it he just held on to the promise Lord you said I can't give you salvation that's the first step calling upon the name of the Lord he that calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved I cannot give it to you but by faith you can reach up and say Lord I don't want to be lost I don't want to go someplace where the Believers are not there then they're not there I want to be with the Believers and all you have to do is call on the name of the Lord but oh when the something gets down burning on the inside after you've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost comes to you because that's a promise of Acts chapter 2 when the Holy Ghost comes upon you because you've repented because you've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it says you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost now if you've never received the baptism of the Holy Ghost my Lord Jesus is here tonight to fill you with his very own life that same spirit that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies but uh just in case you're just starting on your journey I would like you to know that there are believers here that have been walking this way for a long time that have gotten beaten and battered along the way and some have let the Holy Ghost leak out [Music] they've let it leak out because the things of Life came against them [Music] they were wounded they were bruised they were beat down they were kicked in the side and left for dead alongside of the road but the Holy Ghost is here tonight to take all of that from the new believer or the old believer he's here to take and fill you up once again and let the sav of the Holy Ghost wash down through you [Music] and again [Music] if you don't feel nothing [Music] just let your faith reach up let your faith reach up because he's here he's here he wants to save he wants to deliver he wants to set free I would encourage you don't hold on to that stuff don't hold on to it oh my friends tonight Let Freedom Ring in your life say God I realize I don't have to hold on to that that woundedness doesn't have to be my identity any longer that rage doesn't have to be my identity any longer it does not I can have a new identity in the Lord Jesus Christ because he comes to seek and to save that which was lost that which is gone astray that which has been beaten battered and wounded foreign [Music] of the Lord is upon me [Music] because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor you've heard the gospel tonight you've heard the gospel the lovely Lord Jesus Is Right Here Among Us to minister to what need you have it may not look like what we thought it was going to look like but he's here one more time I'm going to call on brother Josh to sing a little bit more of this yeah absolutely absolutely but I believe that our Lord can meet you some he already has but if you've been resisting don't resist him [Music] don't resist him those of you that are familiar with the scripture there was once a man named Saul he was quite an educated man he was part of the upper echelon the Jewish faith well-respected well-educated but God already had his name written down in the Lamb's Book of Life [Music] there was one day when that man saw was going down to persecute the Believers and as he was going down to persecute the Believers because they weren't doing religion the way he thought that they ought to a bunch of fanatics shouting and speaking in tongues crazy bunch gonna go down there and take care of them I'm going to put them in prison I'm going to take care of them but God already had in mind that Paul was going to be one of those that were shouting and speaking in tongues and glorifying God and preaching the Deliverance through the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so all of the sudden and light comes to him and knocks him off of his horse and as it knocks him off the horse Paul was smart enough to recognize eyes say who are you Lord and here's the phrase I wanted to get to because some of you are doing the same thing it's hard for you to kick against the pricks The Nest has got a little bit prickly and you keep kicking at that nest trying to get comfortable you're trying to get comfortable in that old nest but I'm calling to you little eagle I'm calling to you little Eagle bust out of that Nest it's hard for you to kick against the bricks [Music] come follow me saith the Lord of hosts come follow me it may not look like what you want it to it may not look like what you thought it ought to but I have paid a dear price that you could lead in Freedom oh Jesus [Music] there is freedom [Music] where the spirit of the Lord is [Music] freedoms [Music] oh free free [Music] they are falling on everything [Music] oh Jesus Reigns in this place more

Stream that you will seal in everything that you have done seal it in and I'm also asking asking that Eddie had resisted tonight that they would not find sleep through the night until they're giving in to what the spirit of the Lord desires on their life God that there would not be one who would come to the house of the Lord with critical attitude with resistance with I don't understand this but they would encounter the Living God [Music] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I decree this over this body those that are watching this stream Health in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Divine health May there be encounters in the night Supernatural Encounters in the ninth season [Music] that would motivate and provoke cause to be jealous for the things of God in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] there is freedom this rain sing it with me Jesus Reigns in this place oh be Lord of everything be Lord of everything [Music]

many of you know that's what we need more grace to trust him you just can't get it all done in one night my What the Lord Has Done help me now my What the Lord Has Done you can be seated you'll be seated we're leaving but I think you've been standing a long time now I don't think anyone has a I don't feel any bad spirits I'm sure there must be one lurking somewhere in somebody's pocket but I I feel like that you folk have done so well considering that some of you might not be used to this kind of a meeting I'd suppose that internet connections were disconnecting all over the world but sometimes it has to be about those who stand before you so let me just say a couple of things one brother Branham told us that no service is complete without the reading of the word in the receiving of an offering I read six scriptures check we're like all the other churches we're not going to miss a chance to receive an offering check thank you so let's let's be alright I know brother Greeley enough to know that this was God and his wife is sitting here who's known him longer than I have by by a little while you mean when I met you the first time you had not met her well I've known your husband longer than you have he might be a lot of things but he's not about pretense or heirs and he believes the truth of the message and he wouldn't do anything tonight to try to pull away from that and I feel that he had every intention of bringing a sermon tonight and if you really needed a sermon come back tomorrow night and he'll he might bring you one I believe it I believe it I believe we need it but we also need the Living Word to work Among Us and I know that God has spoken into people's lives and I know there are those who will leave here with everything not settled but you come back and you bring your faith and you press in with what you have to press in with and the same God who meant these tonight will meet you I don't understand why everybody doesn't get exactly what they look for every time I I have no theological explanation for that but I know that it's always for a reason and there are some things that we have to throw off of our life as we were hearing tonight there are things that we have to be willing to get rid of and lay down in emotions and feelings and thoughts and pretenses and prejudices and jealousies and all these things and sometimes it's a process God Is Lifting that off and taking that off and taking that off and taking that off so I wouldn't be discouraged in any way if I were you I would come back and I would press in with everything I have to press in with all my hallelujahs all my praise the Lords and all my faith and we're just getting started and I believe we're going to continue to go higher as God is honored and he is given the preeminence I want to invite all of you to have some fellowship with us tonight understanding that brother Greeley is is very tired and and uh let him have a little little bit of space to get his strength back if if he decides to stay with us pray for Benjamin that God will sustain his voice God will help him and I also could use a touch from the Lord physically tonight and he's my healer and he is more he touched me I got a touch from the Lord tonight and I'm believing I'm believing for the continuation of it and I know you are but we're going to dismiss tonight I feel like it it's time for us to do that could I ask you to stand one more time and we want to say again unless you unless you've got a second wind and you want to preach you certainly can is there something else you wanted to say before we go I know there's at least uh well I know that there well I know it's for tomorrow night of course I'm getting that I figured that out already I already got that figured out but I that's it one night at a time you know we can we but I want you to know this I know that there is a group of people here I don't want to say percentages because I'm not sure but I know there's a group of people here that would sit right back down and let him take his text I'm one of them sister Flo's already doing it we're going to save a little for tomorrow night Lord Jesus thank you seems very very very small for what you've done tonight that life it lights up our hearts That Glory that falls on the countenance of someone who has experienced your touch and Lord it's not about a feeling although I would thank you that I have felt you and and I thank you that others have felt you but it's not about a feeling it's not about an emotion not about a chill bump or anything like that it's about what you're doing in the inside and what you're doing in US is for eternity it's not for just one service but it's an eternal work you are truly changing us from glory to glory we are moving forward from strength to strength and from Faith to Faith and that's all because of your great love for us now Lord there are some of it joined us tonight who traveled all day to get here and their bodies are tired and their minds are tired and they need a touch that only you can give them as they sleep tonight and I don't want to undo anything that brother Greely has prayed concerning sleep but I will say Lord that those who are weary in their body you know how to rest them with or without sleep there is a rest that belongs to the people of God we know it's you we know it's the Lord Jesus but we also believe that you can supernaturally charge these bodies and we're asking you to do that so that when we gather here tomorrow night we're fresh again and we're ready to receive whatever you have for us and so Lord we ask right now that you bless the rest of our fellowship this evening we ask that you bless those who have prepared the food and those who labored to buy it and we ask that you give back to them pressed down shaken together and running over may it bring strength to the bodies of your children and may the fellowship and the atmosphere be sweet even in a little bit of mud and we will give you the praise and the honor and the glory for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen you are dismissed to go tonight in the name of the Lord there are the first row of tables where there are white chairs we are holding that for the seniors for those who might have a little bit of a harder time getting across the uneven ground of the tent and so if you will hold that for them I believe there will be seats for all of the rest of us somewhere it'll take them a moment to put the food on the table but please stay and have have a little fellowship with us if you can God bless you as you leave tonight in the name of the Lord go down sister Laurel you've worked hard I can say
