[49:26] amen you may be seated this morning it's
[49:28] wonderful to be in the house of the Lord
[49:32] we still have over a hundred people here
[49:34] this morning with so many out aren't we
[49:37] blessed it's not about people but it's
[49:40] about life it's about living it's about
[49:43] the Holy Ghost breathing life into the
[49:46] body of Believers he's doing that and
[49:49] the Millers will soon be here God
[49:52] willing from Missouri how long has it
[49:55] been that they've been fighting to get
[49:57] here a long time but you know the Lord
[50:01] knows exactly the right timing amen and
[50:05] uh behind the scenes God is working some
[50:08] things out for some other folks who will
[50:10] be making a transition here very shortly
[50:12] too and I'm not allowed to talk about
[50:15] that yet but God is good he's keeping
[50:17] his word he's keeping his promise and uh
[50:20] it's not about filling up a
[50:22] building it's not it's about th those
[50:25] being in their bone it's bone to bone
[50:28] yes sir there you go that's what it's
[50:30] about bone to bone every bone finding
[50:33] his bone yes amen we have so much to be
[50:37] thankful for I want to just thank you
[50:39] for giving uh a little love offering of
[50:43] benevolence to the Hendrick family we're
[50:46] going to be giving the check today to
[50:48] Sister Flo and she's going to pass it on
[50:51] uh to Sister Pam this week and you gave
[50:55] $2,100 and that is greatly appreciated
[50:58] by the family and I want you to give
[51:00] yourselves a
[51:02] [Applause]
[51:05] hand God is
[51:07] good we know that funerals cost a whole
[51:11] lot more than that um I I will very
[51:15] shortly have my mother's paid off so I
[51:17] know exactly how uh but when you're
[51:20] faced with it in the moment you just do
[51:22] what you have to do you give a credit
[51:23] card or you do whatever you have to do
[51:26] and we're beleving that God will
[51:27] multiply that abundantly to Sister Pam
[51:31] and to the family and and that it
[51:33] wouldn't be a too much of a burden for
[51:35] them in an hour like this God is never
[51:38] too late he is always right on time uh
[51:43] food gets throwed out because you take
[51:46] more than people can eat and flowers
[51:49] fade so quickly but a bill comes every
[51:53] month so if we can do something like
[51:56] that this was a great opportunity to do
[51:58] that and one more time sister Flo ask me
[52:01] again this week to thank you for your
[52:04] love for your prayers for your uh coming
[52:06] to the viewing for your coming to the
[52:09] funeral and for this offering for for
[52:11] Pam and and their expenses so we're just
[52:14] thankful that we could be a part of that
[52:16] uh tomorrow is Sister Kathy's birthday
[52:19] and then uh she travels on the 20th uh
[52:23] home for just a uh her old home for just
[52:26] a a short amount of time but let let's
[52:29] wish sister Kathy a happy birthday this
[52:31] week God bless
[52:35] [Applause]
[52:36] her it's a week of
[52:39] birthdays and I would encourage you when
[52:41] you're having all these children if you
[52:43] could just plan not to have them one day
[52:46] right after another because birthdays
[52:49] get costly like that when they all fall
[52:51] in the same time right half of ours were
[52:54] born the same week and so uh we have
[52:57] birthdays uh this week Tuesday this is
[53:00] very hard for me to say these words do
[53:03] not come easy I am straining to say that
[53:07] our baby girl Mariah Destiny is turning
[53:12] 18 that is just hard to
[53:15] comprehend uh could we say happy
[53:17] birthday to
[53:20] [Applause]
[53:24] Mariah and then our oldest that's on the
[53:28] 20th and then our oldest on Wednesday uh
[53:31] Benjamin is having a birthday uh our
[53:35] youngest and then our oldest so we want
[53:37] to wish Benjamin happy
[53:40] birthday
[53:44] 206 he'll be
[53:50] 26 it's
[53:52] incredible and since I'm 56 that means I
[53:55] was 30 when he came so I was already
[53:58] worn
[54:00] out but God is good thank God for a good
[54:05] wife amen who could take good care of
[54:07] our children brother Paul drown a
[54:11] longtime friend supporter brother
[54:15] streamer uh has a birthday on Wednesday
[54:18] he shares a birthday with Benjamin so we
[54:20] want to say and he is so faithful to
[54:24] amen virtually he texts his
[54:28] amens and I want you to know he is
[54:31] faithful he is faithful I don't ever
[54:33] have to worry about him being asleep
[54:35] while I'm preaching there's no way he
[54:37] could be asleep and keep texting as he
[54:40] does and he asked me several times does
[54:43] that good on your nerves I said not at
[54:44] all I appreciate the fact that you're
[54:46] there and that you're awake and uh I had
[54:49] a sweet text from Jennifer sister
[54:51] Jennifer Jernigan this morning I knew
[54:53] they were away we forget some time what
[54:56] all Luke does but Luke is a very
[55:00] important part of this church I'll tell
[55:03] you that he is busy and he is faithful
[55:06] and if he ever hears it said somebody
[55:09] needs to do something that he's capable
[55:12] of doing he always says I'll do it so
[55:15] that means he locks up he stays late
[55:18] sometimes to lock up the building and to
[55:21] be here early and sometimes he unlocks
[55:23] and he and and somebody said well the
[55:26] doors aren't aren't undog we call it and
[55:30] and I said well that might be a job that
[55:32] that Luke Jernigan usually does he's
[55:34] very rarely missing and so we miss them
[55:38] we miss Chad and of course we miss Levi
[55:41] they have not had a family vacation like
[55:43] this for this long of a period maybe
[55:46] ever I don't know if they've ever had
[55:47] this many days off but God has blessed
[55:51] Chad with a good job and a well-paying
[55:54] job and uh I'm very very grateful for
[55:57] his family I know that they're very very
[56:00] thankful to have that and uh had this
[56:03] beautiful text from sister Jennifer this
[56:05] morning that said thank you for praying
[56:07] for us we arrived safely and we are
[56:10] anticipating we're streaming this
[56:12] morning we're anticipating what the Lord
[56:14] has to say to us and I appreciate that
[56:17] even when they were away and not here
[56:19] I'm not thinking about them being in
[56:22] Amusement this morning I know that
[56:24] they're there hearing the word of the
[56:26] Lord
[56:27] and uh it's going to matter one day it's
[56:30] going to matter one day I I'm telling
[56:32] you it's going to matter one day so God
[56:34] bless them and then uh I guess one of
[56:38] Benjamin's best friends I don't know
[56:40] exactly how that happened but uh but
[56:44] Joseph we call him and he doesn't like
[56:47] it I've been told I I I I don't
[56:51] care just to be completely honest uh if
[56:54] I'm calling your name just be thankful
[56:56] that I can remember you by anything
[56:59] because sometimes I forget I call my own
[57:02] children the wrong name and uh I'm
[57:04] already at that stage of life and I know
[57:06] there's enough of you that will
[57:08] appreciate that you understand but uh
[57:12] otherwise Joseph
[57:14] haxon uh our JoJo has a birthday also on
[57:18] Benjamin's birthday I don't believe
[57:21] he'll be 26 how old will he be bethl
[57:25] 15 so I'm not the only one getting
[57:28] old Joseph we love you we thank you for
[57:31] all you

[57:47] streamers when when Hawk is gone you
[57:50] should really be I was looking up there
[57:52] but he's there I could just see the top
[57:55] of Hulk's head
[57:57] and and for all of a second there he
[57:59] looked young enough to be Joseph it it
[58:02] was just your hair he's rejoicing it was
[58:04] just your hair it wasn't your face
[58:07] anyway now I can look at Joseph he is
[58:11] faithful he'll run the camera he'll you
[58:13] streamers owe him a Deb of gratitude
[58:15] because he sometimes runs the whole
[58:17] stream and we're very thankful not only
[58:20] that he's the best shoe Shiner in the
[58:22] whole wide world and tenny pump cleaner
[58:26] what do they call them now we called
[58:28] them Tenny pumps what do they call them
[58:29] now
[58:34] kicks that's like a tennis
[58:36] shoe or something like that he can clean
[58:39] them he can make you think you've got a
[58:42] brand new pair and all moms and dads
[58:45] ought to be thankful for that because

[58:52] don't toss shoes because they're dirty
[58:54] we clean them up as long as they fit
[58:56] right so you need to see Joseph help him
[58:59] build his business and you can give me
[59:02] my cut Joseph for the
[59:05] commercial and then uh Friday is
[59:08] Ashley's birthday uh uh Dave David I

[59:14] want to say own her but I know now that
[59:16] she shares your name but I have yet to
[59:19] change it so uh in all of my things she
[59:22] is still Ashley TBO I guess I should
[59:25] back slash or hyphenate like they do in
[59:28] the modern world we all know that she's
[59:30] a Yantis um and if we don't know that
[59:33] David will tell us but we remember when
[59:36] she

[59:45] [Applause]
[59:51] mommy brother Donovan and sister Audrey

[59:59] want to wish them a happy wedding
[1:00:02] anniversary uh excuse me a wedding
[1:00:04] anniversary on Friday as well we love
[1:00:06] you all even when we can't see you we
[1:00:09] still feel I still feel that you're a
[1:00:12] part of this body and we send you both
[1:00:14] our love and uh we know that it it's uh
[1:00:18] you know it's just today when I if I can
[1:00:22] and I hear that anybody's having an
[1:00:24] anniversary I try to greet them because
[1:00:28] we're living in a world today where
[1:00:31] they're
[1:00:32] married this year and next year they're
[1:00:35] not and so when someone celebrates
[1:00:38] another year of marriage I I appreciate
[1:00:40] it and I like it and I like that they
[1:00:43] made it amen they may not be all that
[1:00:47] they used to be you know we get older
[1:00:50] but thank God that if Jesus is the is
[1:00:54] The Binding part of your marriage you
[1:00:56] can make it last it can stand the test
[1:00:59] of time I don't have much hope for it if
[1:01:02] he's not in it I'll tell you that I'll
[1:01:03] just be honest because part of the
[1:01:05] spirit of leod deia is is to destroy
[1:01:08] marriages and so without him well we're
[1:01:12] just nearly fighting a losing battle
[1:01:14] aren't we yes and I miss Cade I'm so
[1:01:16] glad he had an opportunity to see his
[1:01:18] parents and we want to pray for him
[1:01:21] there's been a lot of sickness on that
[1:01:23] end and and we don't want it so we're
[1:01:26] believing the Lord that he'll be well
[1:01:29] and whole he just come through something
[1:01:30] not too long ago pretty uh severe
[1:01:33] sickness so we're praying that his
[1:01:35] antibodies are
[1:01:37] high
[1:01:39] amen uh then we've got this great group
[1:01:42] I I'm not going to sing I need my time
[1:01:44] but we have this great group of
[1:01:46] musicians and singers and worship
[1:01:49] leaders and even camera people and we're
[1:01:52] thankful for every one of them can we
[1:01:54] give them a great thank you
[1:01:56] and let them
[1:02:00] go we're blessed because of their giving
[1:02:03] to the lord they're giving and they're
[1:02:07] doing it
[1:02:08] volunteer and the least that we can do
[1:02:10] is pick up a piece of trash when we come
[1:02:12] across one and and and volunteer we can
[1:02:16] do something to serve the Lord we're
[1:02:18] serving the lord and serving the
[1:02:20] ministry and uh maybe you can't play my
[1:02:23] point was maybe you can't play an
[1:02:25] instrument
[1:02:26] or maybe you're you're not called on to
[1:02:28] play an instrument but there's always
[1:02:30] something that we can do I don't think
[1:02:33] any of us should have the attitude well
[1:02:35] that's sister Jennifer's job I think if
[1:02:37] you see a Kleenex on a Pew you know
[1:02:41] aren't you a parent and if you're a
[1:02:42] parent if you're a parent you're over
[1:02:44] the
[1:02:45] iys you know when you're not a parent
[1:02:48] you pick everything up like this you
[1:02:50] know but once you become a parent little
[1:02:52] snot no matter whose it is you just pick
[1:02:55] up the clean next and then go sanitize
[1:02:57] your hands uh clean up around the pews
[1:03:01] because uh I come through here sometime
[1:03:03] during the week and I think oh my
[1:03:04] goodness we've got some messy
[1:03:09] folks you're already
[1:03:11] insulted it only takes a few seconds to
[1:03:14] pick up your
[1:03:15] mess just a few seconds and we won't we
[1:03:18] don't charge you rent on your junk that
[1:03:20] you store here and so we're we we just
[1:03:23] think you ought to take your dirty
[1:03:24] things with you when you can
[1:03:26] everything we do you do it unto the Lord
[1:03:29] I mean it I I'm pretty bad because I'm
[1:03:34] the one when I go into an air you know
[1:03:37] an airplane bathroom that's that there's
[1:03:39] not much dirtier in the world than that
[1:03:41] and I see people going in there with
[1:03:43] their socks and I'm not going in there
[1:03:46] with my socks it may take me a while to
[1:03:48] put my shoes back on and and lay them up
[1:03:50] in time but I'm not going in there with
[1:03:52] my socks and people will use the water
[1:03:55] and the water will be all over the
[1:03:57] mirror and the counter and everything
[1:03:58] washing their hands and I'm the one who
[1:04:00] stays and wipes the counter down because
[1:04:03] I like for it to be clean when I go in
[1:04:06] when I'm in public at a washroom I wipe
[1:04:08] the counter down when I'm through not
[1:04:10] usually my water but somebody else's
[1:04:13] because somebody ought to do it
[1:04:14] somebody's got to do it why why it not
[1:04:16] be me I don't ever want to be that
[1:04:19] person who sweeps my side of the steps
[1:04:22] and leaves somebody else's you ever seen
[1:04:24] how people do some sometime cut their
[1:04:26] part of the ditch and won't even go an
[1:04:28] extra foot those are the same people who
[1:04:31] who uh will pay their tithe
[1:04:38] $70.49 oh it's quiet boy if I don't quit
[1:04:41] getting on folks you won't hear me when
[1:04:43] I preach let's stand God is good
[1:04:47] somebody say oh the
[1:04:50] time all the time God is good I mean he
[1:04:55] is good I want you to turn in your Bible
[1:05:00] this morning if you will
[1:05:03] please to
[1:05:05] acts and and that is not the Acts of the
[1:05:08] Apostles that is the acts of the Holy
[1:05:11] Spirit the holy ghost in the lives of
[1:05:14] the Apostles they never healed
[1:05:18] anybody they never cast The Devil out
[1:05:21] they never brought Deliverance anything
[1:05:24] they did they did because because they
[1:05:26] were a glove on the hand of the Lord and
[1:05:29] that gives me hope if God could use that
[1:05:33] rag tag mly crew of broken crackpots I
[1:05:37] know that the Lord can use you and I he
[1:05:41] can with all their failures he used them
[1:05:44] and all of their Brokenness he used them
[1:05:47] I know he can use us as well and it came
[1:05:50] to pass acts
[1:05:52] 16:16 as we went to prayer a certain
[1:05:56] damsel possessed with a spirit of
[1:06:00] divination met us which brought her
[1:06:04] master's much gain by
[1:06:09] soothsaying she was operating in telling
[1:06:13] fortunes and it was a profitable
[1:06:16] business Enterprise that she had going
[1:06:20] on and they were prostituting her out
[1:06:24] for witchcraft and becoming wealthy the
[1:06:28] same followed Paul and us and cried
[1:06:33] saying these men are the Servants of the
[1:06:37] most high God now let's see if we can
[1:06:39] get this right a damsel who was
[1:06:42] possessed by a spirit what kind of
[1:06:45] spirit did it say a spirit of
[1:06:48] divination this damsel possessed by a
[1:06:52] spirit of divination is following the
[1:06:55] men of God around the town and out of
[1:06:58] her mouth is declaring these men are the
[1:07:02] Servants of the most high God which show
[1:07:06] unto us the way of
[1:07:10] Salvation and this did she many days I
[1:07:15] want you to notice this I really want
[1:07:19] you to catch this she was declaring the
[1:07:23] same message day after day after day
[1:07:28] when Paul and the apostles would begin
[1:07:31] to minister the good news of the Lord
[1:07:35] Jesus Christ she would cry out in the
[1:07:39] service in the Gathering and every time
[1:07:42] she would say these are Servants of the
[1:07:46] most high God they show us the way of
[1:07:50] salvation but Paul being grieved not the
[1:07:54] first day
[1:07:56] not the second day not the third day we
[1:07:59] don't even know if it was on the 10th
[1:08:01] day I want you to follow the context of
[1:08:04] this scripture many days we don't know
[1:08:07] if that was a half a dozen or if it was
[1:08:10] 30 many days they said
[1:08:14] nothing and one day she did the same
[1:08:18] thing that she had
[1:08:20] always
[1:08:22] done she's Disturbed the me meeting like
[1:08:26] she had always Disturbed the meeting and
[1:08:30] this day it grieved
[1:08:33] Paul turned and said to the spirit not
[1:08:38] to the woman she was not the problem the
[1:08:41] spirit was the problem I command thee in
[1:08:44] the name of Jesus Christ to come out of
[1:08:49] her and he came
[1:08:52] out the same hour no interview in
[1:08:55] process no tracing the roots to see
[1:08:58] where the spirit got in just come out of
[1:09:01] her in the name of Jesus Christ and when
[1:09:04] her Masters saw that the hope of their
[1:09:08] gains was gone they caught Paul and
[1:09:12] Silas and Drew them into the
[1:09:16] marketplace unto the rulers and brought
[1:09:20] them to the magistrate saying these men
[1:09:24] being Jews
[1:09:26] do exceedingly trouble our city boy they
[1:09:32] got mad their pocketbook was going to be
[1:09:36] affected so they got on the legal train
[1:09:40] to try to shut down didn't matter what
[1:09:43] she was doing fooling people but it
[1:09:46] mattered that now their pocketbooks
[1:09:49] would be affected and they wanted to get
[1:09:51] some legal assistance we shouldn't be
[1:09:55] surprised right father you are good so
[1:10:00] good sometimes when we sing that we we
[1:10:04] think of really good is not enough
[1:10:08] popcorn and butter is good but Lord you
[1:10:12] are so much better you are so much good
[1:10:16] you are so much higher and more valuable
[1:10:20] to us forgive us Lord when our
[1:10:24] vocabulary fall short and that would be
[1:10:27] every day we cannot describe enough your
[1:10:31] faithfulness your worth in our lives and
[1:10:35] we can't imagine where we would be today
[1:10:38] without you lord you make the difference
[1:10:42] we are standing here today we are where
[1:10:46] we are today because of your grace
[1:10:50] because of your token life that has been
[1:10:53] applied to our life you have changed us
[1:10:57] from glory to glory which means we are
[1:11:00] still being changed by your presence and
[1:11:04] by Your glory we give you honor for
[1:11:07] bringing us here today in our right mind
[1:11:11] and anything that is accomplished it
[1:11:13] will be to your glory and to your honor
[1:11:16] we ask for this help in the name of the
[1:11:19] Lord Jesus Christ and for his glory only
[1:11:23] and the Saints said am you may be
[1:11:27] seated so we are still in the series on
[1:11:32] cold love because iniquity shall abound
[1:11:37] the love of many shall wax
[1:11:42] cold in working our way through this
[1:11:46] subject we pulled in something that uh
[1:11:50] had been spoken to me in study in in
[1:11:54] study and in in prayer I didn't hear it
[1:11:57] as an audible voice I heard it in my
[1:12:00] inner man in my inner being but
[1:12:03] sometimes when God talks to us that way
[1:12:06] it can have even a greater effect than
[1:12:10] what we would hear with our natural ear
[1:12:12] when we hear it with our natural ear it
[1:12:15] might affect us momentarily but when God
[1:12:18] screams in our Inner Man somebody said
[1:12:22] well he don't scream he only speaks in a
[1:12:24] still small voice that's very inaccurate
[1:12:27] he speaks to us however we need to hear
[1:12:31] him and and I'm not like you that a that
[1:12:34] a whisper is All I Ever Need I wished I
[1:12:37] was that way that all he ever has to do
[1:12:39] is say uh uh uh uhuh and I'm done he
[1:12:43] does something and I do I respond
[1:12:45] sometime but there are times that I'm
[1:12:47] already uh twirling you know spinning
[1:12:50] and that little no son I don't want you
[1:12:54] to do that my inner man would hear it
[1:12:57] but my outer man even my soul my mind my
[1:13:01] will and emotions might be so far gone
[1:13:04] that I wouldn't be able to respond to
[1:13:06] that voice I'm so glad that God knows
[1:13:09] how to
[1:13:10] whisper I'm glad he knows how to
[1:13:14] shout sometimes he screams to us and
[1:13:17] when he does it reverberates through the
[1:13:20] spirit out toward the soul through the
[1:13:23] mind and the will and the emot emotions
[1:13:25] and it can have a profound effect that's
[1:13:28] how this came he was dealing with my
[1:13:30] heart about three different kinds of
[1:13:33] spirits that we would have to deal with
[1:13:37] uh as the bride of Christ now
[1:13:40] particularly in this season of testing
[1:13:43] we are being proved we are being tested
[1:13:47] somebody said well I have been since I
[1:13:49] found the Lord that's right but there
[1:13:51] are incredible intense seasons
[1:13:55] kah kahos moments where we can say that
[1:14:00] God is particularly putting his finger
[1:14:04] on some things in our life to see to to
[1:14:07] to watch and to observe how we will
[1:14:11] respond we are gradually passing the
[1:14:15] tests Hallelujah one by one we are
[1:14:19] learning to respond right amen we are
[1:14:23] learning to come back to Joy quicker
[1:14:27] we're learning to push our Humanity
[1:14:29] aside and our own will our own emotions
[1:14:32] aside to discern the voice of the Lord
[1:14:36] but we don't always get it and we have
[1:14:38] to uh enter into these moments of
[1:14:42] intense proving and testing you would
[1:14:45] think that most of us would be so far
[1:14:49] above some of these little imps but you
[1:14:52] have to understand that we're living in
[1:14:55] an hour of increasing
[1:14:59] evil evil is not
[1:15:01] shrinking it's not
[1:15:04] diminishing the love of many is waxing
[1:15:07] cold why because iniquity is not only
[1:15:10] present but it's
[1:15:13] abounding and so because iniquity
[1:15:15] abounds because it multiplies because it
[1:15:19] seems to be so successful we are finding
[1:15:23] a a a cold Edge forming in our love for
[1:15:27] him and in our love for one another when
[1:15:30] your love is cold you are easily
[1:15:33] distracted from the
[1:15:34] word you you you you don't burn with
[1:15:37] passion to hear the word of the Lord
[1:15:40] there was a time in this body of
[1:15:42] Believers uh here I go again uh there
[1:15:45] was a time in this body of Believers
[1:15:47] that if someone missed a service they
[1:15:50] wanted to see it they wanted to hear it
[1:15:52] they wanted to catch it because they
[1:15:55] understood that that truth comes in
[1:15:58] layers it comes line upon line it comes
[1:16:03] precept upon precept it's stacked on top
[1:16:07] of each other and so if you miss a a a
[1:16:11] little section of a subject it's
[1:16:13] possible that you'll have a gap in your
[1:16:16] in your foundational uh uh building and
[1:16:19] so uh there was a time some years ago
[1:16:23] that that from the youngest to the
[1:16:25] oldest those who were uh able enough
[1:16:28] they would hear they would see the
[1:16:30] service uh they would build upon it now
[1:16:33] it seems like more or less the older
[1:16:35] ones are the ones who really thrive in
[1:16:38] doing so I I get a a note sometime from
[1:16:42] some of them who say I I've not only sat
[1:16:45] through the service but I have now
[1:16:47] watched it two more times and I'm still
[1:16:50] uh gleaning from it I'm still pulling
[1:16:53] from it I know for me to mention that it
[1:16:56] almost sounds self-serving it almost
[1:16:59] sounds like I'm telling you that that
[1:17:01] you need to hear what I say but I'm
[1:17:04] really am you need to hear what I
[1:17:08] say because I hope that I'm not just
[1:17:11] here tooting my horn if there's any hope
[1:17:14] in me that I'm ever speaking on his
[1:17:16] behalf I don't think it's wrong for me
[1:17:18] to say hear me uh the Apostle said you
[1:17:23] you know uh you you follow
[1:17:26] me as I follow Christ if I'm not
[1:17:30] following Christ anymore then you don't
[1:17:33] follow me you follow him but God does
[1:17:37] this he establishes leadership Etc so uh
[1:17:41] I would encourage even young married
[1:17:43] couples busy busy busy raising their
[1:17:46] children but I would encourage them even
[1:17:49] to go back to to hear a section of it if
[1:17:53] you can't hear it all hear a piece of it
[1:17:56] I would still very much encourage you to
[1:17:59] hear the message of the hour to hear
[1:18:02] what God has preserved for us on tape
[1:18:06] and in book form we're very very blessed
[1:18:09] much spiritual food has been stored for
[1:18:13] us in due season we're not getting all
[1:18:17] of our food from the 60s and the 50s
[1:18:20] we're thankful that God is ever more
[1:18:23] revealing himself
[1:18:25] he's still a walking talking God and our
[1:18:28] foundation is found in Holy scripture we
[1:18:32] are thankful for the right
[1:18:34] interpretation of the word that comes by
[1:18:38] Revelation uh we're very thankful for
[1:18:41] that but we always want to keep Christ
[1:18:44] the word at the center of everything
[1:18:47] that we do because the enemy is going to
[1:18:50] howl and you want to know that when
[1:18:53] you're being how on and blown with Winds
[1:18:56] of of adversity and contrary winds you
[1:19:00] want to know that you're not going to
[1:19:02] blow
[1:19:03] over but that your roots are going to go
[1:19:06] deeper the more you you know toss back
[1:19:09] and forth your roots are being
[1:19:14] stimulated I I just read recently that
[1:19:17] when you are when you are taking a
[1:19:20] cutting from a living plant whether it
[1:19:23] would be a house plant or an outdoor
[1:19:26] plant and uh I fool around with that
[1:19:29] sometime I don't do much outdoor
[1:19:31] gardening anymore but I I fool around
[1:19:34] some time with indoor gardening and um
[1:19:38] you know just house plants so to speak
[1:19:40] and I like to propagate them I like to
[1:19:43] share them and I'm always thankful when
[1:19:45] somebody shares one with me but I
[1:19:48] recently read that you just stick them
[1:19:50] in the water uh most plants will root
[1:19:54] like like that in water you put them
[1:19:56] there you change the water every now and
[1:19:58] again and some will root almost
[1:20:01] immediately and some take longer
[1:20:04] depending on the species but I learned
[1:20:06] recently that there is a way to help
[1:20:09] speed the process that I never knew
[1:20:11] never thought about this before you see
[1:20:13] the water gets
[1:20:15] stagnant it settles and when it does the
[1:20:18] oxygen is
[1:20:20] sealed it's not released it's sealed and
[1:20:24] and I the article said that if you'll
[1:20:27] just take the
[1:20:30] glass ever so often and slos it around
[1:20:34] stirring up the molecules of the water
[1:20:37] that it releases the oxygen and the
[1:20:40] oxygen is what causes the plant to root
[1:20:42] I thought genius so
[1:20:46] simple but
[1:20:47] Genius of course that's something that
[1:20:50] would help and even in our own life
[1:20:54] right we can be surrounded by it but
[1:20:58] sometimes we need to stir ourselves up
[1:21:00] in it a little bit refresh ourselves in
[1:21:03] it so that Our Roots will form and go
[1:21:07] deeper and so the three spirits that
[1:21:09] were highlighted were number one a
[1:21:12] seducing Spirit which usually comes in
[1:21:15] the form of a lie that's an old trick it
[1:21:18] goes all the way back to the Garden of
[1:21:20] Eden amen and uh the LIE it has some
[1:21:24] truth to it always great portion
[1:21:26] sometime but the enemy just has a way of
[1:21:30] twisting the end of the story bending it
[1:21:34] away from the
[1:21:37] word and it deforms it it causes it to
[1:21:41] grow in a different
[1:21:43] direction and uh I am convinced that
[1:21:47] that in many cases those who have
[1:21:50] followed the message of the hour are
[1:21:52] farther away
[1:21:55] than they have ever been
[1:21:58] before because they have allowed this is
[1:22:02] just just a subset it it's not it's not
[1:22:05] uh perhaps the majority there are many
[1:22:08] out there who are following Christ the
[1:22:11] word you've got to hear my heart but the
[1:22:15] enemy will come and he'll Bend something
[1:22:17] a little bit he'll put a little too much
[1:22:22] emphasis on a man
[1:22:25] and and any time we get bent a little
[1:22:28] bit and we start putting too much
[1:22:31] emphasis on a man we're not getting
[1:22:33] closer to
[1:22:34] Christ we're getting further away from
[1:22:37] Christ John the Baptist was the first
[1:22:40] who returned in that
[1:22:43] installment uh in New Testament time in
[1:22:47] that installment of the spirit and power
[1:22:49] of Elijah and uh that commission was
[1:22:53] divided through Through the Ages
[1:22:55] according to Malachi 4 5 and 6 Malachi 3
[1:23:00] talks about the messenger coming John
[1:23:02] the Baptist Malachi 45 and6 is a divided
[1:23:06] verse because we know that John the
[1:23:09] Baptist only fulfilled a portion of that
[1:23:12] commission there was to be another
[1:23:15] Prophet who would come in the spirit and
[1:23:18] power of Elijah because somebody had to
[1:23:21] fulfill the other part parents to
[1:23:23] children children to parents it had to
[1:23:26] be both ways somebody said well didn't
[1:23:28] they ask Jesus about that yes and he
[1:23:31] said you're right he must
[1:23:36] come but he has come now to me I know
[1:23:42] that that could be broke apart and
[1:23:45] criticized but I hear it in in in a in a
[1:23:49] different way than some people hear it I
[1:23:52] hear it with a revelation attached and
[1:23:56] when I hear it I hear Jesus saying
[1:23:58] you're right he is yet to come but he
[1:24:02] has already
[1:24:04] come that's what I hear somebody said
[1:24:06] that's not what it says well it kind of
[1:24:09] is and so for every article that might
[1:24:12] tell you that's not the way it is I I
[1:24:15] want to tell you I think that is the way
[1:24:17] it is somebody said well that's not how
[1:24:19] it's accepted by Orthodox well I've
[1:24:22] never desired to be orthodox
[1:24:26] anything anything I don't want to be an
[1:24:29] orthodox Jew I don't want to be an
[1:24:31] Orthodox Christian I know what Orthodox
[1:24:35] Christians do they pray to
[1:24:37] icons that's what the Greek Orthodox do
[1:24:40] I'm not interested in being Orthodox I
[1:24:42] just want to be a Bible
[1:24:43] believer I want to be a participant in
[1:24:46] the continuation of the book of
[1:24:50] Acts you know the the we understand
[1:24:53] there's another book of Acts that's
[1:24:54] being written even today because God is
[1:24:58] continuing to move among his people by
[1:25:00] the power of the Holy Ghost so I see
[1:25:04] that there was a need John the Baptist
[1:25:06] was forerunning the first coming
[1:25:09] fulfilling a portion of Malachi 4:5 and6
[1:25:12] but there had to be another voice there
[1:25:15] had to be another servant well we're not
[1:25:17] all the time quoting John the Baptist
[1:25:20] and we're not all the time uh trying to
[1:25:23] learn about John the Baptist Baptist and
[1:25:25] when we talk to One Another We're not
[1:25:26] always constantly saying as John the
[1:25:29] Baptist said and what did John the
[1:25:31] Baptist say about
[1:25:33] it and and that's because we we don't
[1:25:36] see his role uh so huge that we would
[1:25:41] emphasize what he has to say so much and
[1:25:45] if we did to stay with me and if he if
[1:25:48] we did why then we would be going
[1:25:51] against his own words because his last
[1:25:54] commission the last thing that he wanted
[1:25:56] to leave us really he didn't have much
[1:25:59] to say in scripture did he but one thing
[1:26:02] we know that he did
[1:26:04] say
[1:26:05] I
[1:26:07] must
[1:26:09] decrease so that he
[1:26:12] might I got to get smaller so that he
[1:26:15] can get
[1:26:17] larger now I I agree that the second
[1:26:20] part of the commission is more
[1:26:22] significant than the first I agree that
[1:26:25] the need for this type of ministry was
[1:26:29] greater in our day in our time than it
[1:26:33] was even in the beginning because the
[1:26:35] church had gotten so very far off I
[1:26:38] think it's only right to mention the
[1:26:41] name the one who God used to fulfill
[1:26:45] that other part I'm not ashamed to use
[1:26:49] brother brandom's name I use it often I
[1:26:52] I like doing it I'm not ashamed shame to
[1:26:54] do it but I understand that in order for
[1:26:58] us to be in Christ and to pursue Christ
[1:27:03] we have to get our eyes on Christ and we
[1:27:07] have to be careful that we don't allow
[1:27:09] this messenger who came to point us to
[1:27:12] Christ we must be careful that we don't
[1:27:15] become enamored with the
[1:27:17] messenger that we don't run around the
[1:27:20] sign and miss the voice because every
[1:27:24] sign has a voice and it'd be like you
[1:27:27] going up to the stop sign and getting
[1:27:30] out of your car and running around the
[1:27:32] stop sign and screaming to your neighbor
[1:27:35] oh I've got a sign I've got a sign I've
[1:27:37] got a sign I've got a sign well that's
[1:27:39] great glad you recognize that God sent a
[1:27:42] sign what did the sign
[1:27:45] say the sign has a
[1:27:47] message it has a
[1:27:49] voice that's why I'm deeply concerned
[1:27:52] about all the people trying to get a
[1:27:53] drive driver's license the other day
[1:27:55] when my daughter was finally getting
[1:27:58] hers and they couldn't speak
[1:28:00] English and no one could communicate
[1:28:03] with
[1:28:05] them and they're going to make it
[1:28:07] somehow through a
[1:28:09] test and they're going to be given a
[1:28:12] license and they can't even communicate
[1:28:14] enough English to perhaps know what the
[1:28:17] sign is
[1:28:18] saying how many of you think it's
[1:28:20] important we don't always have a picture
[1:28:23] [Music]
[1:28:25] sometimes it has actual words on there
[1:28:27] and you might need to know how to read
[1:28:29] those signs because I may be coming
[1:28:31] along and you may be endangering my life
[1:28:34] because you don't know that the sign has
[1:28:36] a voice so we're following the
[1:28:40] voice not the
[1:28:42] sign and I think I believe with all my
[1:28:45] heart that brother Brandon would say to
[1:28:47] us
[1:28:48] today I must
[1:28:51] decrease amen you you must not hang on
[1:28:55] everything every little thing you you
[1:28:57] you must not get so caught up in arguing
[1:29:02] where the period should be or the comma
[1:29:04] should
[1:29:05] be you you really shouldn't be so
[1:29:08] enamored by how many times I knocked on
[1:29:11] the pull
[1:29:12] pit you should hear the voice I believe
[1:29:16] it's going to be critical for the bride
[1:29:18] that's why there's so many seducing
[1:29:20] Spirits loosed that will lie that will
[1:29:23] tell portion of the truth they have this
[1:29:26] whole process uh this whole thought
[1:29:29] process that's basically Guilty By
[1:29:33] Association and I want you to know that
[1:29:35] that doesn't stand up in a court of
[1:29:39] law you can be an accessory to a crime
[1:29:43] as long as it can be
[1:29:45] proven that you are
[1:29:48] aware of the crime is that right but you
[1:29:51] can't send someone off as a an accessory
[1:29:54] to the crime if you can't prove that
[1:29:57] they knew about the
[1:30:01] crime now it gets a little sticky when
[1:30:04] you're the getaway
[1:30:06] driver because somebody comes running
[1:30:08] out with a bag of money and a mask over
[1:30:10] their face and tells you to
[1:30:12] drive you need to know that's not Bagels
[1:30:15] in the
[1:30:17] bag and in those cases you might have
[1:30:20] not been at all aware of really what was
[1:30:22] going on you're just a driver but that
[1:30:26] mask that gun going in the holster and
[1:30:28] that bag and the alarm going off should
[1:30:32] have been enough to let you know I am
[1:30:34] participating in a crime and you can be
[1:30:36] sent away I don't think it's fair to
[1:30:39] make Jesus Christ
[1:30:41] guilty for everything that his people
[1:30:46] do I don't think we should condemn Jesus
[1:30:49] because some of his followers are
[1:30:51] weirder than weird
[1:30:55] and I don't think we should judge
[1:30:56] brother brandom or our pastor or anybody
[1:30:59] else our our Congressman for that M
[1:31:02] because of who they have to sometime
[1:31:05] associate with and the things of God
[1:31:08] It's Not Guilty By
[1:31:10] Association it it's are you on the word
[1:31:13] are you with the word Are you standing
[1:31:16] on the word so these Spirits manifest in
[1:31:20] various ways first of all the seducing
[1:31:22] spirit that is a lying spirit and then
[1:31:25] religious spirits that come as delusions
[1:31:29] and a delusion is such a possessive uh
[1:31:32] frame of mind a possessive thought
[1:31:35] process that will convince you that you
[1:31:38] are on the right Road when everything
[1:31:41] you're saying and doing is going against
[1:31:44] the word but you're so
[1:31:48] deluded and this is how uh men and women
[1:31:52] who burn in passion for for the same
[1:31:55] gender it's how that many of them have
[1:31:59] gone over the edge the Apostle tells us
[1:32:02] they have stepped across the line
[1:32:05] because they did not like to retain God
[1:32:09] in their knowledge he turned them
[1:32:12] over to a reprobate mind to believe a
[1:32:17] lie and be damned that doesn't mean that
[1:32:21] every person who has participated in
[1:32:24] that sin of immorality and perversion or
[1:32:27] any other sin for that matter it doesn't
[1:32:30] mean that they have crossed the line but
[1:32:33] what it does mean is some have already
[1:32:36] crossed that line because even knowing
[1:32:39] that it is sin they continue to follow
[1:32:43] those passions and those lusts and God
[1:32:46] says eventually in his time
[1:32:50] enough is enough you'll never find your
[1:32:54] way back to me now that's a hard cold
[1:32:58] reality we don't claim that for anybody
[1:33:01] we know in love but it is what the
[1:33:03] scripture said the delusion can become
[1:33:07] so heavy and you can even be so
[1:33:11] religious when they have the pride The
[1:33:14] Pride gatherings in downtown you can ask
[1:33:16] brother Shaw because he seen them their
[1:33:18] churches represented there
[1:33:21] pastors represented there under a
[1:33:24] religious
[1:33:25] delusion that that it's okay to be in in
[1:33:29] that lifestyle it's a strong spirit that
[1:33:32] takes a hold most of us are are dealing
[1:33:36] more or less with number three a
[1:33:38] familiar Spirit which we've talked about
[1:33:40] and we can't do too much talking now uh
[1:33:44] what we've already said but the word
[1:33:46] that is used there for familiar spirit I
[1:33:51] in in the scripture that we read to you
[1:33:53] and initially Leviticus 20 and6 it's a
[1:33:57] word that is pronounced OB and it is
[1:34:01] describing the The Familiar sound that's
[1:34:04] where we get the familiar from it is
[1:34:06] describing the familiar sound of opening
[1:34:10] a skin of water or a skin of wine
[1:34:13] because uh uh in biblical times uh skins
[1:34:17] were used inside out for storing liquid
[1:34:21] water or wine or even even olive oil and
[1:34:26] if if there was any air trapped in the
[1:34:30] bottle in the skin when the lid was
[1:34:33] opened it made a
[1:34:35] sound uh in in uh in Isaiah I believe it
[1:34:40] is there is a scripture that uses that
[1:34:43] word uh that is talking it's the word
[1:34:46] that's used there is
[1:34:48] ruach does anybody remember the word
[1:34:50] ruach it it's a Hebrew word for
[1:34:54] spirit and it can be God's spirit ruach
[1:34:58] hakodesh the Holy Spirit or it can just
[1:35:01] be ruach another Spirit another kind of
[1:35:04] spirit and so instead of using the word
[1:35:08] OB in this particular place in Isaiah
[1:35:12] they use the word ruach to let you know
[1:35:15] that this is a familiar sound everyone
[1:35:18] knew what was happening nobody jumped
[1:35:20] nobody ran out of the room when that
[1:35:22] little uh uh gust
[1:35:24] of of of air would come out of the
[1:35:26] bottle that's the word that's used for a
[1:35:29] familiar Spirit we talked about how that
[1:35:33] these Spirits can run reconnaissance how
[1:35:36] that they can can be monitoring spirits
[1:35:39] and they can pick up words that are
[1:35:42] spoken and they can carry a matter it's
[1:35:45] not a bird I told you Tuesday night it's
[1:35:48] not a bird that's carrying the matter
[1:35:50] it's a metaphoric bird it's a SP spirit
[1:35:54] and it'll sometimes make sure that you
[1:35:57] know something about somebody that
[1:35:59] you're really not supposed or really
[1:36:01] shouldn't or have no business knowing
[1:36:03] but that's how these enemies work these
[1:36:06] Spirits like to pit people against one
[1:36:09] another I want you to hear what I'm
[1:36:11] saying they want to make enemies out of
[1:36:14] friends they want to make it so awkward
[1:36:17] that you can't be in the room together
[1:36:19] when you're
[1:36:21] Believers and we sometimes have to take
[1:36:24] authority over that thing and say you're
[1:36:28] not going to do that in my
[1:36:33] life uh you know we just
[1:36:36] realize that the reality is there is
[1:36:40] somebody somewhere that doesn't like you
[1:36:43] and there is somebody somewhere talking
[1:36:45] about
[1:36:47] you not everybody but
[1:36:50] somebody and if that bothers you just go
[1:36:52] in and be bothered
[1:36:55] but eventually you'll have to grow up
[1:36:58] and you'll have to real let them
[1:37:01] talk you know old people they get to a
[1:37:03] place as they get older uh it don't
[1:37:05] matter to them as
[1:37:07] much what people say they they feel like
[1:37:10] they've earned the
[1:37:12] right you know I'm already
[1:37:16] there I'm 56 years old I don't expect to
[1:37:20] live another 56 years on this planet I'm
[1:37:23] already past my middle age and and so I
[1:37:26] I just might say something that I that I
[1:37:29] would normally say I'm not going to cuss
[1:37:32] I'm not talking about using uh uh curse
[1:37:35] words but I'm talking about you know
[1:37:39] okay I used to hear the oldtimers say
[1:37:41] well that's all right let them talk if
[1:37:43] they're talking about me they're giving
[1:37:44] somebody else a rest that's easy to say
[1:37:47] a little harder to pull off but I'm
[1:37:49] almost to that
[1:37:51] place just go ahead and say if you need
[1:37:53] to say it say
[1:37:55] it but I'm going to just keep on going
[1:37:59] we used to sing that song folks May uh
[1:38:02] false accuse me and scandalize my name
[1:38:06] but I'm going on with
[1:38:09] Jesus just the
[1:38:11] same where else will I go and should I
[1:38:15] let you be my judge or should I work to
[1:38:18] please him so yeah I I wish I could tell
[1:38:21] you that everybody likes you
[1:38:25] I I wish I could tell you that everybody
[1:38:26] likes your
[1:38:29] haird and your choice of of
[1:38:33] dress but they
[1:38:35] don't and you can choose to let that
[1:38:37] bother you hinder
[1:38:40] you breach a
[1:38:43] relationship but you just need to
[1:38:44] realize you're going to have a hard time
[1:38:46] finding someone who agrees with
[1:38:48] everything that you
[1:38:50] think you're going to decide whether or
[1:38:52] not you'll let it stop you or slow you
[1:38:55] or impede you or not I say
[1:38:57] no that this word familiar spirit in the
[1:39:00] Latin remember it comes from the
[1:39:02] description of a household servant so
[1:39:05] it's a spirit that serves a person by
[1:39:09] gathering by by by doing lots of things
[1:39:12] by by having a a a hold a a influence on
[1:39:18] even personality and
[1:39:21] behavior can person be possessed with a
[1:39:25] spirit like that they can but most
[1:39:29] likely uh and more often a familiar
[1:39:32] spirit is one that oppresses because it
[1:39:35] needs to be free to move about through
[1:39:38] the family
[1:39:39] line it needs to be free to move about
[1:39:43] from one member of a family to another
[1:39:45] member of a family and so more or less
[1:39:49] it influences from the outside in
[1:39:52] somebody say that somebody said well
[1:39:54] that's good well is it good I don't know
[1:39:56] it it might be slightly better but it's
[1:39:58] still not an ideal situation if we
[1:40:02] should come to an understanding that a
[1:40:05] spirit is influencing how we choose how
[1:40:08] we behave how we act what we say we
[1:40:11] ought to be concerned about
[1:40:13] it we should be concerned about it now
[1:40:16] Tuesday night we talked about disruption
[1:40:19] disruption and an inappropriate
[1:40:22] disturbance or or
[1:40:29] eruption that interrupts normal and
[1:40:33] common plans and
[1:40:34] programs you can just always depend on
[1:40:38] certain folks to interrupt the
[1:40:46] program always
[1:40:51] late always arriving a
[1:40:55] tither never bring peace with them when
[1:40:57] they
[1:40:58] move are you saying that everyone like
[1:41:01] I'm not I'm not saying that everyone
[1:41:03] like that is under the influence of a
[1:41:06] familiar Spirit but I'm telling you that
[1:41:09] these Spirits operate so
[1:41:13] familiarly that we sometimes blame them
[1:41:17] on
[1:41:18] personality without realizing that it's
[1:41:20] not a change in personality we need it's
[1:41:23] a form of
[1:41:25] Deliverance it can run by the line of
[1:41:28] iniquity through a family not just one
[1:41:31] to a generation it could be multiple to
[1:41:33] a generation on occasion everybody's
[1:41:37] going to be running
[1:41:39] late it's going to happen but there are
[1:41:42] also Spirits familiar spirits and one of
[1:41:46] the ways they operate is to
[1:41:49] disrupt and how you can begin to kind of
[1:41:51] notice how this thing will work is a
[1:41:55] normal uh Behavior Uh if someone is late
[1:41:58] their normal behavior would be to slip
[1:42:02] in it's going to get a little tight cuz
[1:42:04] I'm going somewhere in a little while
[1:42:06] you might as well get it over with now
[1:42:08] I'm going to take my time you know just
[1:42:11] kind of slip in but when a spirit is
[1:42:14] involved you'll find that that person
[1:42:17] under the influence of that thing uh
[1:42:19] will will everything they do
[1:42:23] they draw
[1:42:25] attention so there is no slipping in
[1:42:29] quietly it's it's rare that that would H
[1:42:32] everybody in the room just about is
[1:42:34] going to know they've
[1:42:36] arrived come on and that is
[1:42:42] disruptive at the very
[1:42:44] least it's wrong because it's
[1:42:47] disruptive but it could possibly be the
[1:42:51] characteristics
[1:42:53] of being under the influence of a
[1:42:56] familiar spirit that has been invited
[1:42:59] into your life by an iniquity that has
[1:43:03] not been broken in a family
[1:43:05] line sometimes described as going from
[1:43:08] zero to 100 interruptive Behavior to
[1:43:13] incre you you're talking to someone and
[1:43:16] and all of a sudden you're you're you're
[1:43:19] just expressing yourself and you trigger
[1:43:22] something in
[1:43:25] them and sometimes now now look we're
[1:43:28] going to talk about manipulation in a
[1:43:30] moment and sometimes that Spirit the
[1:43:33] spirit of manipulation and coercion will
[1:43:36] cause uh someone to press your
[1:43:40] button because they like to see you
[1:43:44] erupt that's a generational trait
[1:43:48] too and they know just what to say are
[1:43:50] you with me they know just what to say
[1:43:53] to get you to explode and they like to
[1:43:56] push that so that is certainly a reality
[1:44:00] but
[1:44:01] also that that this Spirit of disruption
[1:44:05] you're talking to someone and that thing
[1:44:08] gets on them it comes on them it raises
[1:44:10] up on them and the next thing you know
[1:44:14] you you're being like yelled at and
[1:44:19] harassed and you're really taken back
[1:44:23] now if you're a manipulator you know
[1:44:25] what you did and you deserve what you
[1:44:29] get but if you're not you're standing
[1:44:33] there sincerely wondering what did I
[1:44:38] say because you may not be aware of the
[1:44:42] trigger but the spirit is and I dare say
[1:44:46] if you won't go back a generation you'll
[1:44:49] find somebody that had the same trigger
[1:44:52] language
[1:44:55] and maybe more than one in a generation
[1:44:58] and if you go back you'll probably have
[1:45:01] well look folks I don't want to live by
[1:45:03] triggers I want to be able to control
[1:45:06] myself I want to be able to control my
[1:45:08] behavior I want to be able to control my
[1:45:10] thoughts and I particularly want to be
[1:45:13] able to control what comes out of my
[1:45:14] mouth
[1:45:16] hello so we need to be aware of this
[1:45:19] kind of disruptive behavior it can
[1:45:22] certainly
[1:45:23] rule in a child's life and it can rule
[1:45:27] in an adult's life and we don't want any
[1:45:30] part of it at all to increase
[1:45:32] explosively in intensity to shift from a
[1:45:35] calm state to an agitated state in a
[1:45:39] very short amount of time I'm reading on
[1:45:43] these Spirits sometimes manifest to draw
[1:45:47] attention from something
[1:45:51] of remember Tuesday night we talked
[1:45:54] about things that can happen in a church
[1:45:58] service to draw someone's
[1:46:01] attention I want you to know the enemy
[1:46:03] doesn't care who he
[1:46:05] uses and as much as we want to encourage
[1:46:09] our children to be
[1:46:12] free to Worship the Lord we also want to
[1:46:16] be
[1:46:17] mindful of how they're moving their
[1:46:21] body because even even small children
[1:46:24] can come under the influence of that
[1:46:27] kind of a spirit that causes them to
[1:46:31] perform you know it's probably true that
[1:46:34] there is a ballerina locked up in every
[1:46:36] little girl so to speak there's
[1:46:39] something about a girl in a twirly
[1:46:42] skirt that makes her want to
[1:46:45] move nothing wrong with spinning or
[1:46:47] moving or and that's perfectly in line
[1:46:50] and in order in the house and home and
[1:46:54] but when they come to church it's your
[1:46:56] responsibility as a parent to kind of
[1:46:58] help guide them just a little without
[1:47:00] crushing their
[1:47:02] spirit because sometimes if they catch
[1:47:05] someone's eye it becomes a little bit of
[1:47:09] a
[1:47:10] performance hips are
[1:47:14] twisted oh you didn't want me to get
[1:47:16] this plane did you that we don't want no
[1:47:20] no part of that we want them to
[1:47:23] understand there's an appropriate way
[1:47:25] now when they're tiny tiny we can't we
[1:47:27] you know it's very hard to explain those
[1:47:29] kinds of things to them but we can't
[1:47:31] look away
[1:47:32] forever because if it is becoming a
[1:47:35] distraction to someone
[1:47:37] else it's not serving the purpose of
[1:47:40] worship so all things have to find a
[1:47:43] balance I hesitate to ever honestly to
[1:47:46] say anything like this to bring a
[1:47:48] balance because I know that some parents
[1:47:51] are not balanced
[1:47:53] and their answer to everything is stop
[1:47:56] you just can't do it no more well that's
[1:48:00] wrong and if you think that's what I'm
[1:48:03] saying you're misunderstanding me we
[1:48:06] don't want to
[1:48:07] squelch the freedom that a child needs
[1:48:11] to learn
[1:48:13] now because we don't want them to become
[1:48:16] like
[1:48:18] we rigid stiff inhibited
[1:48:23] intimidated to worship God we want them
[1:48:27] you know we've been criticized for 30
[1:48:30] plus years because the children used to
[1:48:32] run around when people were worshiping
[1:48:35] they would run I don't care what you
[1:48:37] folks say it doesn't matter to me that
[1:48:40] you've of all the things you could
[1:48:42] criticize you chose that I would rather
[1:48:45] them learn freedom to express themselves
[1:48:49] that way now than to have to cast a
[1:48:52] religious devil off of them when they're
[1:48:54] 50 because they sin against the Holy
[1:48:57] Spirit by quenching him quench not the
[1:49:01] Holy Spirit that's a
[1:49:04] scripture it's a sin to quench
[1:49:07] him it's a sin to sit down on him so
[1:49:10] what are you really try a
[1:49:12] balance in all things we don't ever want
[1:49:15] to be so disruptive so distracting even
[1:49:18] in a service even with our
[1:49:20] worship as an adult
[1:49:23] we don't ever want to become so
[1:49:25] distracting that we're drawing attention
[1:49:27] to us instead of
[1:49:31] him it's him it's him that we want
[1:49:34] people to look at do you agree in the
[1:49:38] message early spiritual experiences in
[1:49:40] paragraph 27 brother bandam said now
[1:49:43] they were all muddled up in their
[1:49:44] Doctrine and Devils out there fortune
[1:49:46] tellers uh was the only ones them was
[1:49:49] not not the only ones but ones that was
[1:49:52] wck recognizing him to be what he was
[1:49:55] the Apostle and recognizing the apostles
[1:49:58] to be what they were men of God it was
[1:50:01] fortune tellers and Devils that
[1:50:03] recognized it first it's what brother
[1:50:05] brandham is telling us so Paul turned
[1:50:08] and rebuke that Spirit of divination
[1:50:10] from the woman
[1:50:12] why well I'm giving you an answer
[1:50:15] because in that particular day she was
[1:50:18] being
[1:50:20] disruptive she was always is telling the
[1:50:23] truth these are men of God who show us
[1:50:28] the way of
[1:50:30] Salvation she was not in
[1:50:33] order she was not out of order to tell
[1:50:36] the truth but she was out of order and
[1:50:40] yielding to the spirit of divination
[1:50:43] when she began to be distracting with it
[1:50:46] you see it's one thing to go through the
[1:50:48] crowd and say listen I want you to
[1:50:49] listen to these guys you've got to hear
[1:50:51] what they have to say because they are
[1:50:53] showing us the way of Salvation some of
[1:50:55] that could have actually been coming out
[1:50:57] of a
[1:50:58] hunger to get rid of the devil that was
[1:51:01] leading her and all of a sudden follow
[1:51:04] the way of Truth the way of Salvation
[1:51:06] it's one thing to go around and and and
[1:51:08] hand out a note that says listen I want
[1:51:10] you to listen these men have the way of
[1:51:12] Salvation or to go around Whispering a
[1:51:14] little bit but on this particular day
[1:51:15] she became so disruptive with her
[1:51:18] confession of
[1:51:19] Truth Now I want you to hear what these
[1:51:22] men are saying
[1:51:24] on no no you be quiet so people can
[1:51:28] hear but that particular day Paul caught
[1:51:31] that and he turned around and rebuked
[1:51:33] the spirit of divination from the woman
[1:51:35] she couldn't tell no more fortunes he
[1:51:38] didn't need the devil to testify who he
[1:51:40] was he knowed who he was he was God
[1:51:44] Saint and let me just go ahead and tell
[1:51:46] you that the devil cannot
[1:51:49] predict the future
[1:51:54] you need to understand that now he knows
[1:51:56] what the word said better than some of
[1:51:58] us but he can't predict the future so
[1:52:01] how do fortune tellers operate well they
[1:52:03] have a genuine
[1:52:05] gift but they're using it under a false
[1:52:08] anointing and the false anointing that
[1:52:10] they're using to to operate this gift is
[1:52:14] a familiar spirit so they're not getting
[1:52:17] the information from Holy Spirit they're
[1:52:20] getting the information from familiar
[1:52:24] spirits that might just be might be just
[1:52:27] as accurate because these familiar
[1:52:30] spirits they are
[1:52:32] monitoring the
[1:52:34] situation and they will feed to the
[1:52:37] person under the spirit of divination
[1:52:40] the information that they need to speak
[1:52:42] over the person person that's exactly
[1:52:44] right that could be a gift from God it
[1:52:47] it could be a gift even that God is
[1:52:49] using by his Spirit it could be a gift
[1:52:51] that is genuine from God but yielded to
[1:52:55] a false anointing or to a wrong Spirit
[1:52:59] did I confuse you with that brother
[1:53:01] brandham tells us the gifts and callings
[1:53:03] of God are without repentance brother
[1:53:05] brandham goes to a fair one day and a
[1:53:06] fortune teller sees him walking by calls
[1:53:09] him over and begins to tell him the
[1:53:11] truth about his life he said she had a
[1:53:14] genuine gift but she didn't get that
[1:53:17] information from the same source that he
[1:53:19] was getting his information from when he
[1:53:22] stood they're Discerning the hearts of
[1:53:23] the people same gift same kind of gift
[1:53:28] but not the same Source you understand
[1:53:32] and so someone can actually step out
[1:53:33] from under the right source and continue
[1:53:37] to operate in a gift that has nothing to
[1:53:40] do with true Discerning of spirits it's
[1:53:42] actually information that's being fed to
[1:53:44] them by monitoring familiar Spirit are
[1:53:48] you clear so he said he didn't need the
[1:53:51] devil to testify who he was he knowed
[1:53:54] who he was he was God's Saint he didn't
[1:53:56] need the devil's help but the devil was
[1:53:59] telling the truth about
[1:54:02] him anyhow Jesus told the devil said
[1:54:05] hold your peace come out of him it was a
[1:54:08] her he didn't need the devil's help but
[1:54:12] the devil was
[1:54:14] screaming nothing different than what
[1:54:16] had been going on many
[1:54:19] days but this particular day
[1:54:23] it manifested in a disruptive
[1:54:27] manner I just want to I just want that
[1:54:30] to sink in may I have some water while
[1:54:33] you
[1:54:34] sea pause and think on
[1:54:40] that
[1:54:43] dancing for
[1:54:46] instance can be a genuine
[1:54:50] expression of one's gratitude
[1:54:53] and praise to God for freeing
[1:54:57] them from a place of
[1:55:00] bondage but if it is stirred or
[1:55:04] provoked by a familiar spirit that
[1:55:08] operates in a disruptive
[1:55:10] manner then what what you've been doing
[1:55:13] your expression maybe the same
[1:55:16] step same manner that you've had for
[1:55:18] years glorifying God in truth but if
[1:55:22] you're prodded or poked influenced by a
[1:55:26] wrong Spirit doing the same thing you've
[1:55:29] always done can now become a
[1:55:33] manifestation of A
[1:55:36] disruption that can break down the
[1:55:39] service and it can actually distract
[1:55:43] from something much more important that
[1:55:46] needs to be said or needs to be seen if
[1:55:50] you think you understand what I'm saying
[1:55:53] I I want to pause for you to say amen
[1:55:55] amen maybe you do maybe you don't I
[1:55:58] don't know because when that disruption
[1:56:01] begins to be a hindrance we come to part
[1:56:03] two here a hindrance is a resistance
[1:56:08] that causes delay a barrier or
[1:56:11] obstruction to slow
[1:56:14] progress have you ever felt like you
[1:56:16] were spinning your tires in the mud have
[1:56:20] you ever felt like a Geral on a
[1:56:23] proverbial gerbal wheel going fast all
[1:56:26] the time sweating fast heart rate going
[1:56:31] nowhere spending all of your energy are
[1:56:34] you with me I hope you're being taught
[1:56:36] and that's why you're quiet spending all
[1:56:39] of your energy but really taking no
[1:56:43] ground wearing yourself out like one
[1:56:45] who's beating the air but never punching
[1:56:48] the enemy are you following me that
[1:56:51] spirit Spirit a familiar Spirit can
[1:56:54] operate eruptive and disruptive it can
[1:56:57] also operate in a way to hinder to slow
[1:57:00] down to impede
[1:57:03] progress slow progress an obstruction an
[1:57:07] unusual and this is out of the ordinary
[1:57:09] for most people tendency in a person's
[1:57:12] life to seemingly attract hindrances and
[1:57:17] conflict
[1:57:23] this can be the results of a
[1:57:26] manifestation of a familiar spirit that
[1:57:29] has followed a family through
[1:57:31] generational iniquity I want to say it
[1:57:34] that way each time because I want you to
[1:57:37] understand you may be under the
[1:57:39] influence of something like this and not
[1:57:40] be evil and not be bad be a child of God
[1:57:44] be wanting to make it like everybody
[1:57:47] else around you but but finding these
[1:57:50] hindrances these things popping up in
[1:57:52] your life because you've just never
[1:57:55] taken the time to realize this is not
[1:57:57] who I am this is not my personality this
[1:58:00] is the influence of a spirit some people
[1:58:03] have weird
[1:58:06] personalities you know some people don't
[1:58:08] really want to
[1:58:09] work they want to
[1:58:12] eat but they don't really want to work
[1:58:14] for it some people will never be
[1:58:16] successful because all they're doing is
[1:58:19] looking for success
[1:58:22] without a great amount of
[1:58:24] effort I have a poor friend who's buried
[1:58:27] now who actually died here attending a
[1:58:31] meeting some years ago and if he had
[1:58:35] flaws he did we were close enough
[1:58:38] friends for me to know them he always
[1:58:41] believed that the next
[1:58:43] thing was going to be the
[1:58:47] thing the next
[1:58:49] investment was going to be the thing
[1:58:53] I told him years before I'm not giving
[1:58:56] you another
[1:58:58] penny for
[1:59:01] anything I'll buy your lunch but I'm not
[1:59:05] investing in any more of your
[1:59:08] scams well he said I'm not in I'm not in
[1:59:12] no I know you're not trying to cheat me
[1:59:14] you sincerely believe that you're going
[1:59:16] to bless me and I'm going to bless the
[1:59:17] ministry and we're all going to be
[1:59:20] wealthy I don't know how many envelopes
[1:59:22] came to my house with all these cards
[1:59:24] with all this information with all this
[1:59:27] stuff I don't know how many times I've
[1:59:29] been gifted foreign currency from all
[1:59:32] kinds of countries because one day it
[1:59:34] was going to hit big again and I could
[1:59:36] cash the the currency and it was going
[1:59:38] to make me Rich and there was an island
[1:59:40] in the sea where where a king had been
[1:59:44] wealthy and he hid the money and they
[1:59:45] were going to find the money and I had
[1:59:48] been given I've got a a file cabinet
[1:59:51] full I I I want you all to know I'm rich
[1:59:54] the problem is what I'm rich in has no
[1:59:58] value I have tons
[2:00:03] of
[2:00:06] currencies and and and uh that are never
[2:00:09] going to be worth
[2:00:12] anything and I wanted to believe in all
[2:00:14] of
[2:00:15] them but listen that can be the
[2:00:18] manifestation of a spirit
[2:00:22] that really just wants to hinder you
[2:00:25] from working your way into
[2:00:29] success some people will never be
[2:00:35] married because their expectations of
[2:00:38] what they
[2:00:41] deserve are much higher than what they
[2:00:44] have to
[2:00:46] offer I'm just being very
[2:00:50] real I'm talking about about men who
[2:00:53] will say I I don't want a wife that's
[2:00:55] overweight why she's going to be
[2:00:57] eventually
[2:01:02] anyway most
[2:01:05] likely and and you're going to have a
[2:01:07] dad B the problem is I've noticed that
[2:01:10] sometimes men who say things like that
[2:01:12] have already got their dad B and they're
[2:01:15] not a
[2:01:17] dad but they know what they want they
[2:01:20] remind me of that brother in the north I
[2:01:22] loved him who decided that he had a
[2:01:25] great list of things he wanted for his
[2:01:28] wife and he didn't ever want he didn't
[2:01:30] want to marry a girl who had ever worn a
[2:01:36] t-shirt he was so convicted that a woman
[2:01:39] should not wear a t-shirt no matter how
[2:01:42] feminine it was what color it was
[2:01:45] because it pertained to a man and he
[2:01:48] said I don't ever want a wife that has
[2:01:51] ever wore a
[2:01:59] t-shirt did you know that I said to him
[2:02:03] brother
[2:02:05] babies they may snap between the
[2:02:10] legs but a onesie is really no more than
[2:02:13] a
[2:02:14] t-shirt so you find me a baby that
[2:02:17] hadn't worn a cotton
[2:02:19] onesie you find me a woman that hadn't
[2:02:21] wor
[2:02:22] I think you better find a baby in the
[2:02:24] cradle and convince the
[2:02:27] parents to raise her like you want her
[2:02:31] and then face the weird looks that
[2:02:32] you're going to get when she's 14 and
[2:02:34] you marry her because you may never find
[2:02:37] I don't want a woman that's ever worked
[2:02:39] a day in her life not even a lemonade
[2:02:43] stand see sometimes we can get caught up
[2:02:47] in our huge
[2:02:50] expectations it's Pride
[2:02:54] we think we're a bigger
[2:02:56] prize men men I'm telling you men are
[2:02:59] bad we are bad we have a tendency to
[2:03:03] think we're a bigger
[2:03:05] prize than we really
[2:03:08] are sisters can operate the same way
[2:03:12] never have a husband because they've got
[2:03:14] this you know unhealthy
[2:03:17] idea did you know that could actually be
[2:03:20] a spirit now you should say your goals
[2:03:23] high but I want you to know that most of
[2:03:25] the time what matters to them doesn't
[2:03:28] matter really in the long run if you
[2:03:31] don't want your wife to wear a t-shirt
[2:03:32] tell her before you marry her don't
[2:03:34] Court her and then tell her on the
[2:03:36] wedding day I'm not going to allow you
[2:03:38] to wear a t-shirt go ahead full
[2:03:40] disclosure tell it all but she probably
[2:03:42] has worn one before that's in the
[2:03:45] past she's being redeemed
[2:03:49] now move past it folks don't allow
[2:03:54] spirits to hang around from from
[2:03:57] iniquities in generational lines that
[2:04:00] will try to hinder everything you try to
[2:04:03] do in your
[2:04:07] life there's certain people that just
[2:04:10] attract a hindrance and they attract a
[2:04:12] conflict and they attract a
[2:04:15] trouble that's no it's no shame there's
[2:04:18] nothing to be condemned of but if if
[2:04:22] it's a spirit we want to send that
[2:04:25] Spirit packing that's right can you say
[2:04:29] Amen they seek to prevent let me see
[2:04:32] let's let's go on hindering Spirits
[2:04:34] which includes familiar spirits work to
[2:04:37] steal kill and destroy by thwarting your
[2:04:42] progress toward a goal or a
[2:04:45] destination they seek to prevent you
[2:04:48] from moving forward by keeping you
[2:04:50] locked
[2:04:53] in your here's the word again
[2:04:55] familiar past they delay impede hamper
[2:05:00] and hold you back in various facets of
[2:05:02] Life most importantly in
[2:05:06] your first Thessalonians 2 let's see
[2:05:09] what time it oh I'm doing good first
[2:05:11] thessal you didn't think so but I did 1
[2:05:13] Thessalonians 2:177 and 18 but we
[2:05:16] Brethren being taken from you for a
[2:05:18] short time in presence not in heart
[2:05:21] endeavoring the more abundantly to see
[2:05:24] your face with great desire wherefore we
[2:05:28] would have come unto you even I Paul
[2:05:32] once and
[2:05:34] [Music]
[2:05:35] again
[2:05:38] but read it Satan hindered
[2:05:43] us can we say it again Satan hindered
[2:05:50] us somebody he said isn't God Sovereign
[2:05:54] Satan
[2:05:56] hindered
[2:05:58] us now how could he do that yeah God
[2:06:00] allowed
[2:06:01] it that doesn't necessarily mean it was
[2:06:04] in the perfect plan of God especially if
[2:06:07] this hindrance is coming to you because
[2:06:10] of a familiar spirit that needs to be
[2:06:12] dealt with he allowed it but it may not
[2:06:15] be his perfect will he might be allowing
[2:06:18] you to go into your permissive will his
[2:06:20] permissive will and let me remind you
[2:06:22] though that God is such a redeemer that
[2:06:25] the prophet said that God knows how to
[2:06:29] let you being in his permissive will
[2:06:33] serve to bring you to
[2:06:37] his well I believe that I believe every
[2:06:41] misstep is another opportunity if we let
[2:06:44] it be that God can move and squeeze us
[2:06:47] closer push us closer to his perfect
[2:06:51] plan for our life but as I said to you
[2:06:53] in Friday's text don't
[2:06:56] settle don't settle for his permissive
[2:06:59] will if you realize that you're not in
[2:07:03] the perfect will of God
[2:07:06] stop don't keep going stop wait on the
[2:07:11] Lord seek his face and let him direct
[2:07:15] your
[2:07:16] steps Satan hindered Us in the message
[2:07:21] person perseverance are you good for a
[2:07:22] few more minutes let's pray now he said
[2:07:25] for these cloths here our heavenly
[2:07:27] father they they taken from the body of
[2:07:30] St Paul handkerchiefs or aprons and it
[2:07:32] said that unclean spirits went from
[2:07:36] them we realize that we're not St Paul
[2:07:40] but we know that you're still the same
[2:07:42] Jesus for you're just as much alive

[2:08:00] that Israel was on its March to the
[2:08:02] promised land a great Pillar of Fire

[2:08:09] represented them represented God for
[2:08:12] them on the earth and this Prophet LED

[2:08:25] road there was something in the
[2:08:29] way while they were walking in the line
[2:08:33] of
[2:08:34] duty you may be walking in the line of
[2:08:37] duty a spirit may want to try to block
[2:08:41] you in hem you in contain you God looked
[2:08:44] down out of the heavens through the
[2:08:46] pillar of fire and the Sea got
[2:08:49] scared and it rolled back back and
[2:08:52] opened up the road right through the Red
[2:08:54] Sea for Israel to go on the path of Duty
[2:08:58] and they went to the promised land you
[2:09:02] understand on the path of Duty the enemy
[2:09:06] raised up something to hinder
[2:09:10] them they didn't let it stop them he
[2:09:14] said God when these handkerchiefs are
[2:09:16] laid upon the sick and The Afflicted
[2:09:18] look he said Satan has crossed cross the
[2:09:23] line I I want you to start using that
[2:09:28] devil you have crossed the
[2:09:32] line you are hindering me from my path
[2:09:36] of
[2:09:38] Duty he said let the power that raised
[2:09:41] up our Lord who's present now come upon
[2:09:45] these handkerchiefs good good good good
[2:09:48] good it's good and whenever they touch
[2:09:51] the sick May the devil get scared just
[2:09:53] like the Red Sea was scared let the
[2:09:55] devil get scared while he looks down
[2:09:57] through the blood of Jesus Christ and
[2:09:59] may every one of them be
[2:10:01] healed loosed delivered set free May
[2:10:07] every one of them shove every familiar
[2:10:10] Spirit out of their life breaking the
[2:10:13] spirit of

[2:10:17] on in the path of Duty Grant it Lord we

[2:10:27] shakes we mortal beings Lord how we
[2:10:29] thank you for your goodness bless these
[2:10:32] now in Jesus name it's from the message
[2:10:35] perseverance which means we have to
[2:10:37] press on we can't let these Spirits
[2:10:41] hinder us
[2:10:45] forever
[2:10:47] procrastination we can't let these
[2:10:50] Spirits h hinder us
[2:10:54] forever in the message we would see
[2:10:56] Jesus I hope you'll pay close attention
[2:10:58] to this he said
[2:11:00] what if there was a stock of corn
[2:11:03] growing and a chunk was laying on it
[2:11:07] like a limb like the lwh hanging limb of
[2:11:11] a
[2:11:12] tree it had grow crooked he
[2:11:15] said of course it would he had that
[2:11:19] experience he saw in the field
[2:11:22] hunting on the edge of the field he saw
[2:11:25] corn that had been bent down by low
[2:11:29] hanging Limbs and the corn looking for
[2:11:33] the light of the sun had found its way
[2:11:36] around the limb and continued to grow
[2:11:41] hindered affected
[2:11:44] handicapped deformed but still trying to
[2:11:48] grow so this is how hindrances can be it
[2:11:51] grow crooked pick up move every obstacle
[2:11:55] that's hindering and the Sun that is
[2:11:56] sticking up towards it'll finally grow
[2:11:59] that stock of corn right out straight
[2:12:04] again you turn your plants because they
[2:12:07] grow toward the Sun and they'll just
[2:12:09] start leaning out the window and you
[2:12:10] turn them so that they'll they're
[2:12:12] sticking out this way but guess what
[2:12:14] they'll start leaning that way again
[2:12:17] that's the same kind of principle he
[2:12:19] said cast out an evil spirit then the
[2:12:23] people say well wasn't nothing happened
[2:12:25] to me you grow right back straight you
[2:12:27] may not realize when a spirit is told to
[2:12:31] go especially if it's oppressing you and
[2:12:34] not possessing you but brother brandom
[2:12:36] said you move that hindrance and you
[2:12:39] start growing straight again so you may
[2:12:41] not feel feel like something glorious
[2:12:44] has taken place but how many of you know
[2:12:46] it's a good thing to grow straight we
[2:12:48] don't want to grow crooked we don't want
[2:12:49] to grow deformed we want to be right
[2:12:52] upright amen he said if you believe that
[2:12:55] and know that something's happened to
[2:12:56] you there's nothing to keep you from
[2:12:58] straightening right back again you just
[2:13:01] hold on to it my that is good and as
[2:13:04] sure as the S so n who controls all
[2:13:07] eternal life if it strikes that
[2:13:09] germatize predestinated seed something
[2:13:12] happens it takes a hold and there it
[2:13:15] holds there twist its way through every
[2:13:19] obstacle
[2:13:21] there is finally it sticks his head up
[2:13:24] and said praise God I knew it was so he
[2:13:27] said that's it that's Faith believe it
[2:13:29] don't just make
[2:13:33] believe be a
[2:13:37] believer
[2:13:40] genuine these spirits will anoint
[2:13:44] people as
[2:13:46] frustrators of
[2:13:49] purpose to stand in your way it's a
[2:13:52] spirit doing it we don't fight
[2:13:54] peoples we fight Spirits are you still
[2:13:57] here are you still
[2:13:59] awake these spirits will anoint people
[2:14:01] as frustrators of purpose to stand in
[2:14:05] your way and block your progress you
[2:14:08] need to deal with them somebody said
[2:14:11] well I've got to I'd have to reach over
[2:14:12] to somebody else's oh no no no no no no
[2:14:16] it's probably closer to home than you
[2:14:18] realize it's probably generation
[2:14:21] it's probably iniquity that hasn't been
[2:14:23] broken in your own family line it's not
[2:14:27] you looking for another family in the
[2:14:29] church to blame them for the spirit
[2:14:31] that's trying to hinder
[2:14:34] you we're not on a Witch
[2:14:37] Hunt we're looking internal we're
[2:14:40] looking inside in Ezra 4 4 and five in
[2:14:45] the Amplified just to save a little time
[2:14:47] not reading both then the Samaritans the
[2:14:50] people people of the land continually
[2:14:53] weakened the hands of the people of
[2:14:56] Judah and troubled and terrified them in
[2:15:01] building and hired counselors against
[2:15:05] them to do what frustrate their purpose
[2:15:09] and plans all the days of Cyrus King of
[2:15:13] Persia even until the reign of daras the
[2:15:17] second King of Persia they hired men to
[2:15:23] counsel them to frustrate their purpose
[2:15:27] to tell them it can't be done you're
[2:15:30] wasting your time it'll never happen
[2:15:32] that way you might as well quit all
[2:15:35] stirred up by a spirit that wants to
[2:15:39] hinder are you following me good I've
[2:15:42] got to move on and I have to get a
[2:15:44] little more of this out before we stop
[2:15:46] Third Way
[2:15:49] manipulation manipulation and
[2:15:52] intimidation you understand how they
[2:15:54] work but remember this before we get
[2:15:57] into this one some people blame
[2:16:02] intimidation on everything that happens
[2:16:05] in their life I was intimidated to get
[2:16:08] prayer I was intimidated to ask for
[2:16:10] prayer I was intimidated to get a
[2:16:12] pastor's advice I was intimidate look
[2:16:15] folks these Spirits can never be your
[2:16:19] excuse and some people walk in a
[2:16:22] constant state of intimidation and like
[2:16:24] to blame it on a person he intimidated
[2:16:27] me she intimidated me when there is a
[2:16:31] great possibility that you're the one
[2:16:33] that's dealing with that kind of a
[2:16:35] spirit and the enemy is causing you to
[2:16:39] constantly feel intimidated like
[2:16:42] everybody is trying to control you when
[2:16:45] in reality the enemy is trying to Bluff
[2:16:47] you and make you think that everybody
[2:16:50] has got time to rule in your business so
[2:16:54] it works both ways I want to say that
[2:16:56] before we start manipulation means to
[2:16:59] control or play upon by Artful unfair or
[2:17:04] Insidious
[2:17:05] means especially to one's own advantage
[2:17:09] to gain power or influence over someone
[2:17:13] and now we're taking this as a spirit a
[2:17:18] familiar Spirit of manipulation that
[2:17:21] runs in Family
[2:17:23] Lines to control or to play upon by
[2:17:28] Artful unfair or Insidious means which
[2:17:31] means
[2:17:33] dishonest Unholy means especially to
[2:17:37] one's own
[2:17:39] advantage to gain power or
[2:17:44] influence to
[2:17:46] control someone
[2:17:48] else this is one of the tightest Spirits
[2:17:51] in Family Lines a spirit of
[2:17:54] manipulation it runs from generation to
[2:17:57] generation and I suggest that if you're
[2:18:00] going to marry a young
[2:18:02] woman whose mother is
[2:18:07] controlling that you pray long and
[2:18:12] hard and you be honest and open and
[2:18:18] forthright because that is a spirit that
[2:18:21] runs in family
[2:18:24] lines and you don't want to become the
[2:18:27] victim of that you don't want to teach
[2:18:30] your children how to manipulate their
[2:18:33] spouses you want that thing to stop
[2:18:37] mother may not be evil it may be her
[2:18:40] father he may not be evil but the
[2:18:44] problem with the spirit of manipulation
[2:18:46] is if it doesn't get its
[2:18:49] way it'll
[2:18:51] lie it'll cheat it'll
[2:18:57] steal it'll give fake
[2:19:00] press if if it doesn't S consider itself
[2:19:05] successful in controlling someone else's
[2:19:08] life it'll get Unholy in a hurry it'll
[2:19:11] tell a ball faac lie that spirit will
[2:19:13] anoint someone to look you in the face
[2:19:18] tell you a straight out lie
[2:19:22] to try to control your
[2:19:27] reaction that's a family thing that's a
[2:19:30] generational thing that's an iniquity
[2:19:32] thing it can be
[2:19:34] broken it must be
[2:19:38] broken we shouldn't even really make
[2:19:41] this joke and I I'm not putting all this
[2:19:43] on women but we shouldn't really make
[2:19:46] this joke you know yeah I'm the
[2:19:49] head I've heard women say it often he's
[2:19:52] the head but as they say I'm the
[2:19:56] neck that turns the head well first of
[2:20:00] all you don't want to be the neck that
[2:20:03] turns the head can the Saints say Amen
[2:20:07] you sisters don't want that
[2:20:10] responsibility because if you assur if
[2:20:13] you usurp the authority of a husband
[2:20:17] you're going to Bear the
[2:20:19] responsibility before God that a husband
[2:20:22] has to Bear a dad and a and a husband
[2:20:26] they're going to answer to God for the
[2:20:29] way they treat their wife and
[2:20:32] children stepchildren too they're going
[2:20:35] to answer to God for that if a wife is
[2:20:39] constantly trying to be the neck that
[2:20:41] turned down I know I I I need to say
[2:20:45] that some of you have learned to live in
[2:20:48] controlling and abusive situations
[2:20:51] by very carefully tiptoeing around the
[2:20:53] Tulips the problem with that is if your
[2:20:56] children see you
[2:20:59] manipulating even for a noble
[2:21:03] cause you see women will sometimes learn
[2:21:07] how to ask their husband something for
[2:21:11] their children to
[2:21:14] do dad said no so they go to
[2:21:18] mom somebody said really brother Shelly
[2:21:21] we don't need this sermon this morning
[2:21:23] there's no one in this house guilty of
[2:21:25] that are you kidding
[2:21:29] me you you ought to pay me double this
[2:21:31] week not tell me that you don't need it
[2:21:34] you ought to give me a big old raise for
[2:21:37] telling you this because it's nothing
[2:21:39] but the truth I understand that some
[2:21:42] dads and husbands have such a
[2:21:44] personality that a wife has to learn to
[2:21:46] be creative and crafty sometime and even
[2:21:50] Pres ing
[2:21:51] something but you've got to be very
[2:21:54] careful walking down that
[2:21:57] road because you can easily fall under
[2:22:01] the influence of a spirit that manifests
[2:22:04] itself as a manipulation as a
[2:22:06] manipulative spirit and it's not just
[2:22:09] getting the kids permission to go over
[2:22:11] to somebody else's house it becomes the
[2:22:13] next thing and the next thing and the
[2:22:15] next thing and the next thing and and
[2:22:17] and here's what you'll find if dad cares
[2:22:20] enough to ask a question when
[2:22:24] confronted a spirit will hardly ever
[2:22:28] tell the
[2:22:30] truth as long as you don't confront a
[2:22:32] spirit it it'll it'll it'll sometimes
[2:22:35] speak the truth but once you confront a
[2:22:37] spirit it'll hardly ever so if a dad
[2:22:40] asks back or pushes back if a woman is
[2:22:43] under that manipulation Spirit uh she
[2:22:47] would lie very quickly
[2:22:55] just a
[2:22:57] minute I hope nobody goes home this
[2:22:59] afternoon and
[2:23:04] fusses text me if you
[2:23:07] do don't do that don't go and listen
[2:23:11] listen listen now let me tell you
[2:23:12] something else while we're on the
[2:23:14] subject stop using
[2:23:18] me stop using using me to prove your
[2:23:25] point didn't you hear Brother Shel say
[2:23:27] didn't you hear the pastor
[2:23:30] say leave me out of your trouble you
[2:23:34] understand people only quote me when it
[2:23:36] suits
[2:23:40] them and let me tell you something you
[2:23:42] use that on your wife I hope she
[2:23:44] remembers a dozen more powerful things
[2:23:46] that I said that she can use right back
[2:23:49] that's not the way to do things you you
[2:23:51] think sometime you can do that and it
[2:23:53] and they'll listen more but folks that
[2:23:55] doesn't create the right it's like Mama
[2:23:57] telling wait till daddy gets home it's
[2:23:59] not the right kind of environment to
[2:24:01] produce h a mother doesn't need to
[2:24:03] always say wait till daddy gets home
[2:24:05] wait till daddy gets home wait till
[2:24:07] daddy gets home because that's putting
[2:24:09] too much pressure on Daddy a mother's
[2:24:12] going to have to learn to discipline too
[2:24:15] there are certain cases that need to go
[2:24:18] to a higher
[2:24:19] Court but some can be settled in the
[2:24:21] lower courts do you understand because
[2:24:25] when Dad gets home it shouldn't always
[2:24:27] be a fearful
[2:24:28] event sometimes it needs to be a happy
[2:24:31] event or am I telling you the truth so
[2:24:35] watch that manipulation thing don't
[2:24:39] allow that to get into your marriage
[2:24:42] into your relationships it's a spirit
[2:24:44] it's wrong it's not a personality
[2:24:47] problem and if they inherited it from
[2:24:49] their mother or father it's because it's
[2:24:51] a spirit manipulation is not
[2:24:56] genetic manipulation doesn't come
[2:24:58] through the DNA it comes by the
[2:25:00] influence of a wrong
[2:25:02] spirit so shake out from under that now
[2:25:07] he said some it goes on to say someone
[2:25:10] influenced by a manipulative spirit will
[2:25:13] turn everything you're doing and worked
[2:25:16] hard to do upside down for his own or
[2:25:19] her own personal benefit when a spirit
[2:25:23] is in operation it doesn't care the
[2:25:26] collateral damage or who gets hurt in
[2:25:29] the
[2:25:29] process it's just to prove a point to
[2:25:33] exercise control and we know that it
[2:25:36] happens in ministries and we know that
[2:25:38] there are spiritual leaders who use
[2:25:41] their influence to abuse and that is
[2:25:43] wrong it is demonic that is not how we
[2:25:47] lead by by a spirit of intimidation or
[2:25:51] manipulation that is
[2:25:53] wrong whoever is guilty that is wrong
[2:25:58] spirits of manipulation will use any
[2:26:00] tool they can get advantage of here's
[2:26:03] the three that I want to mention quickly
[2:26:06] disrespect when the
[2:26:08] manipulator senses any sort of
[2:26:10] disagreement or eroding influence he or
[2:26:14] she it's a demon but using a person will
[2:26:18] also accuse the target
[2:26:21] hoping to gain control and influence
[2:26:24] with the one who made the original
[2:26:28] complaint why do we always have to agree
[2:26:31] with someone when they come and bring us
[2:26:34] a bad
[2:26:36] report can we not ever say I don't
[2:26:40] agree are we as children of God uh not
[2:26:44] capable of saying no disrespect intended
[2:26:48] but I don't agree with your summation of
[2:26:50] what happened I I don't share your
[2:26:53] opinion you don't have to share mine I
[2:26:56] don't have to share yours but nine times
[2:26:58] out of
[2:27:00] 10 we dig in our bag somebody will bring
[2:27:03] us a negative report and we dig in our
[2:27:06] bag of
[2:27:09] memories to see if we can find something
[2:27:12] that we can relate that complaint to and
[2:27:16] we say You know
[2:27:17] what last year I had a similar
[2:27:21] experience with that person and they did
[2:27:24] the same thing to
[2:27:26] me 12 months ago a year ago did you have
[2:27:30] to why couldn't you have just said you
[2:27:32] know lately that has not been my
[2:27:35] experience at all we need to pray more
[2:27:39] and talk
[2:27:41] less we don't
[2:27:43] realize how manipulative these Spirits
[2:27:46] can operate and you're sucked in and all
[2:27:50] you're doing is noding your head and
[2:27:51] saying amen but you're sucked in and
[2:27:55] what happens when that Spirit gets a pat
[2:27:57] on the back it doesn't
[2:28:03] shrink I'm going to read that again
[2:28:06] because it's getting Mighty tight in
[2:28:08] here when the manipulator senses any
[2:28:10] sort of disagreement or eroding
[2:28:12] influence he or she will also accuse the
[2:28:15] target hoping to gain control and
[2:28:17] influence with the one who made the
[2:28:20] original
[2:28:23] complaint looking sometimes people the
[2:28:26] spirit in in a person using a person is
[2:28:32] fishing and we're too dumb to realize
[2:28:37] it thank you you know you can preach and
[2:28:41] not yell
[2:28:44] right they're fishing to find our
[2:28:48] vulnerability to find our little place
[2:28:50] where we have a problem with that
[2:28:55] person and the next thing you know we're
[2:28:58] two at a
[2:28:59] time we're talking so fast and so loud
[2:29:03] that we're not even hearing the other
[2:29:05] person we're just unloading all of these
[2:29:08] past memories are just rolling out and
[2:29:11] we don't realize that we're just
[2:29:12] strengthening that Spirit on the
[2:29:15] manipulator and they'll go into the next
[2:29:17] situation this works on your jobs
[2:29:20] in a house in a church in a
[2:29:24] family did you know that Spirit of
[2:29:26] manipulation will
[2:29:30] pout let don't let me get ahead of
[2:29:32] myself number two
[2:29:34] gossip the person under a spirit of
[2:29:36] manipulation will often help to spread
[2:29:41] rumors about the
[2:29:43] target hoping to find someone who would
[2:29:46] agree with them therefore gaining
[2:29:47] influence over those already struggling
[2:29:50] Ling with what with authority number
[2:29:54] three
[2:29:56] guilt the these spirits will often
[2:29:59] anoint people to attack you for not
[2:30:01] doing
[2:30:04] enough while blaming you for their own
[2:30:08] slackness I I better read that one
[2:30:11] again these spirits will often anoint
[2:30:13] people to attack you for not doing
[2:30:15] enough you're not doing
[2:30:17] enough while blaming you for their own
[2:30:21] slackness guilt is often the tool of
[2:30:27] choice oh it's getting extremely tight
[2:30:29] not just your quietness but the
[2:30:31] atmosphere squeezing
[2:30:33] up it's like a python in
[2:30:37] here guilt is often the tool of choice
[2:30:40] to force another person to forsake their
[2:30:42] own
[2:30:43] Vision their own goal their own
[2:30:46] direction to take up someone else's
[2:30:50] guilt
[2:30:52] husbands don't manipulate your
[2:30:55] wife with
[2:30:58] guilt
[2:31:00] wives don't use guilt on your
[2:31:03] parents don't use that on your children
[2:31:06] children be careful how you would use
[2:31:08] that on your parent church
[2:31:10] folks be careful how we use guilt to get
[2:31:13] our
[2:31:15] way you know it's no it's no it's no
[2:31:18] real uh shock
[2:31:20] when some people
[2:31:24] cry cuz some people just
[2:31:28] cry they got leaky heads like
[2:31:32] mine they just
[2:31:35] cry when I hear something unfair I
[2:31:38] cry it touches me and I get too
[2:31:43] involved
[2:31:44] emotionally when I read one of these
[2:31:46] tragic stories on the internet about a
[2:31:50] van accident and young Ministry and
[2:31:53] missionaries died and all I want you to
[2:31:55] know that really hurts my
[2:31:58] feelings so you shouldn't be fooled you
[2:32:01] shouldn't be you know necessarily
[2:32:03] persuaded because I
[2:32:06] Cry Sometimes that fools people I don't
[2:32:09] use it to fool people but sometimes
[2:32:12] people are fooled by tears and they
[2:32:13] think oh he was so
[2:32:18] sincere she was so
[2:32:22] broken she was so he was so
[2:32:27] sorry for what he had done and
[2:32:31] sometimes it's not really
[2:32:33] sincere
[2:32:36] repentance it's a spirit of
[2:32:40] manipulation that has run in
[2:32:42] generational lines through iniquity I
[2:32:45] hope you're listening as you're moving
[2:32:52] to cause someone to feel
[2:32:55] guilty and do what you want them to
[2:32:59] do don't don't don't let tears be what
[2:33:02] moves you don't let guilt be what moves
[2:33:07] you you've got a you've got a control
[2:33:10] tower you've got a
[2:33:12] leadership that comes from inside come
[2:33:15] on now don't you give in to somebody's
[2:33:19] cries because their feelings got heard
[2:33:22] and some people like I said can cry at
[2:33:24] the drop of a hat and they're not all
[2:33:26] women I just confess you I'm a person
[2:33:28] who cries a lot so you know just because
[2:33:31] you see me cry don't don't go out of
[2:33:33] here and think you know well I better
[2:33:35] just do everything he said because he
[2:33:37] was really crying over that he was
[2:33:38] really broken about that I might have
[2:33:40] been I most likely was I'm using myself
[2:33:44] as an
[2:33:46] [Music]
[2:33:47] example but how many of you know
[2:33:50] guilt will cause you to do a lot of
[2:33:54] things Proverbs 26 are you still here
[2:33:58] good I may call a service tonight
[2:34:00] Proverbs 26: 24 and 25 he that
[2:34:04] hateth
[2:34:05] deth
[2:34:09] with and layeth up deceit within him
[2:34:15] when he speaketh
[2:34:17] Fair believe him not
[2:34:20] for there are seven
[2:34:22] Abominations in his
[2:34:26] heart you can be
[2:34:28] sincere and be sincerely wrong a
[2:34:32] politician can be
[2:34:34] passionate and
[2:34:36] wrong preachers can be
[2:34:39] passionate and wrong it's not by words
[2:34:43] it's not by only what comes out of a
[2:34:46] lip but it's what's going on in the
[2:34:48] heart let me see if the complete Jewish
[2:34:51] Bible will help you on this
[2:34:53] verse he who hates May hide it with his
[2:34:58] speech but inside he Harbors
[2:35:03] deceit it's a spirit on a man on a woman
[2:35:07] he may speak
[2:35:10] pleasantly but don't trust
[2:35:13] him for seven
[2:35:16] Abominations are in his heart smooth
[2:35:19] smooth
[2:35:21] speech but inside
[2:35:23] deceit that's what a spirit will do
[2:35:25] especially if it gets uh strengthened in
[2:35:28] a generational line now in the message
[2:35:31] what do you who do you say this is he
[2:35:35] said what
[2:35:36] happened if I could just get a little
[2:35:41] further what happened Methodist all down
[2:35:45] Through the Ages zwingley Finley finny
[2:35:48] all of the rest of them when they had a
[2:35:50] Revival what did they do with it throwed
[2:35:52] it right into a denominational
[2:35:54] feast and crawled in how sad crawled in
[2:36:00] with the rest of them put a brand on you
[2:36:03] like the rest of them now listen then
[2:36:06] you've got a bunch of man controlling
[2:36:09] you the Holy Spirit can't move no
[2:36:15] farther because man has taken control
[2:36:20] right he said that's exactly you start
[2:36:22] to preach something the Bible teaches
[2:36:23] like that and the denomination don't
[2:36:25] believe that they'll put you right out
[2:36:28] try it once and see if it's right or not
[2:36:30] you'll see that it's the truth see at
[2:36:32] denominational Feast every time they're
[2:36:34] called to it that balum Feast trouble
[2:36:37] sets in oh Luther Wesley Pentecost all
[2:36:40] of them are victims of it when man tries
[2:36:45] to control what belongs to God
[2:36:49] not following the leadership of the
[2:36:51] spirit based on the truth of the word
[2:36:54] even around a message of Truth like ours
[2:36:57] if man starts exercising
[2:37:01] control do you know how powerful it is
[2:37:04] to put all the blame on somebody that's
[2:37:09] dead do you know how powerful it is for
[2:37:12] a man to stand here and tell you believe
[2:37:14] everything he said speaking of brother
[2:37:16] brandom do you know how powerful that is
[2:37:21] because then brother brandham has no
[2:37:23] responsibility to come and explain
[2:37:27] himself that's how people can use
[2:37:31] quotations to manipulate
[2:37:33] situations because you don't get to ask
[2:37:36] brother brandom and you don't get to ask
[2:37:38] the
[2:37:39] preacher because in a lot of places if
[2:37:42] you ask the preacher they're very
[2:37:44] offended and they say uh uh you know we
[2:37:46] don't question the prophet
[2:37:51] sometimes they'll say show me that in
[2:37:52] the word we don't question the prophet
[2:37:54] all thus sayith the Lord you know how
[2:37:56] powerful that is that a I used to hear
[2:37:59] them say who would do that what Minister
[2:38:01] would do that in their right mind
[2:38:02] there's no benefit to that oh but there
[2:38:04] really is a lot of benefit to that
[2:38:06] because you can manipulate people by
[2:38:08] using the the the various sets of quotes
[2:38:11] that say different
[2:38:12] things it's going to get very quiet in
[2:38:14] here
[2:38:16] huh you keep convincing people it's all
[2:38:18] thus sayith the Lord it's all that
[2:38:20] sayith the Lord then you can lift a
[2:38:22] quotation out of context beat the people
[2:38:25] with
[2:38:26] it get them to do whatever you think
[2:38:29] they ought to be
[2:38:30] doing and brother brandham is
[2:38:32] blamed but he has no way of coming and
[2:38:35] explaining himself you know there he he
[2:38:38] might have possibly if he were alive
[2:38:40] today he might have possibly updated his
[2:38:43] method not his
[2:38:45] gospel but his method he might have made
[2:38:49] an adjustment to church
[2:38:51] order he might have said hey we you know
[2:38:53] we can sing something that I don't I I I
[2:38:56] must have given you the impression that
[2:38:57] everything had to be written 40 years
[2:38:59] ago to sing it but I didn't mean to give
[2:39:01] you that impression he he might say a
[2:39:04] lot but he
[2:39:05] can't so it's very manipulative sometime
[2:39:08] the way people use the quotes ministers
[2:39:11] always use the quotes to try to keep
[2:39:15] people under a sense of
[2:39:17] control and when there comes time to
[2:39:19] question well I can't speak for brother
[2:39:21] brandom you know I just that's just what
[2:39:23] he said so really there's no one to put
[2:39:25] any responsibility on it all do you see
[2:39:28] how the enemy could even use a great
[2:39:30] truth like we have to really put man in
[2:39:38] control you you listen I want to tell
[2:39:41] you something somebody in this church
[2:39:43] were to come up to me and tell me that
[2:39:44] brother bam was their
[2:39:47] Pastor you be prepared for me to tell
[2:39:50] you go
[2:39:52] home stay
[2:39:55] home hear you a tape send your tithe to
[2:40:00] Jeffersonville and see how all that
[2:40:03] works out for you but there are people
[2:40:05] who will attend churches in this message
[2:40:08] and tell others in that church the
[2:40:10] pastor is not my pastor brother bram's
[2:40:13] my pastor isn't that convenient isn't
[2:40:15] that convenient sit in a church eat the
[2:40:18] man's groceries and send your
[2:40:21] tithe somewhere
[2:40:24] else and then you have no responsibility
[2:40:27] to do what the pastor asked because he's
[2:40:29] not really your pastor you don't belong
[2:40:31] to be in a church that's
[2:40:34] right you just stay home then that's
[2:40:36] right that's right and it goes on I have
[2:40:39] people D all well I go to so- and- so's
[2:40:41] church but he's not my pastor who
[2:40:43] is who
[2:40:47] is it's control control of a different
[2:40:51] level the unity of one God in the one
[2:40:54] church he said but the working of the
[2:40:56] Holy Spirit the kingdom of God in you
[2:40:59] God sits on the throne of your heartall
[2:41:03] in his control
[2:41:05] room controlling your emotions and
[2:41:09] controlling your powers and controlling
[2:41:12] your conceptions and making you
[2:41:16] one with him in fellowship and in love
[2:41:21] and God fills you with love he filled
[2:41:24] you with power he filled you with his
[2:41:27] Spirit he fills you with his own divine
[2:41:29] nature and he changes your carnal nature
[2:41:32] into his nature then in this you become
[2:41:38] a new creation in Christ we got to be
[2:41:42] controlled we have to have something to
[2:41:46] control
[2:41:47] us it's not men and it's not
[2:41:50] manipulative
[2:41:51] spirits but there is a control that sits
[2:41:56] on the throne if we get all the junk off
[2:42:00] he'll sit on the throne and he will
[2:42:03] control our conceptions and powers and
[2:42:07] and make us one with him how many of you
[2:42:10] are glad of
[2:42:12] that and then I'll just mention this
[2:42:15] last one in closing to give you a little
[2:42:17] something to because we got to go
[2:42:19] musicians are coming we have a little
[2:42:21] baby to
[2:42:28] dedicate so we have
[2:42:30] had
[2:42:32] disruption that's one of the ways of
[2:42:34] familiar Spirit can manifest
[2:42:37] hindrance and now we have had
[2:42:41] manipulation and then the last for for
[2:42:43] now and I won't get too far into it just
[2:42:46] the sort of the definition confusion
[2:42:50] the spirit those familiar spirits they
[2:42:54] Thrive if they can confuse
[2:42:57] you so that you don't know the mind of
[2:43:03] God they don't want you to have Clarity
[2:43:07] they don't want you to fully Embrace
[2:43:09] God's will for your
[2:43:11] life and they'll cross Family Lines if
[2:43:15] necessary to confuse you to frustrate
[2:43:18] you to keep you from being able to make
[2:43:21] a stand for the will of God they will
[2:43:24] bring
[2:43:25] disorientation if we could put that up
[2:43:28] they'll bring disorientation
[2:43:30] bewilderment
[2:43:32] turbulence and
[2:43:34] turmoil do you know people who seem to
[2:43:37] be caught up in a swirl of
[2:43:40] disorientation bewilderment I don't
[2:43:44] understand turbulence and turmoil
[2:43:46] bringing upheaval and chaos leaving
[2:43:49] others unsure and unable to process or
[2:43:54] proceed that confusing devil is so
[2:43:59] contagious that it will paralyze other
[2:44:03] believers it will put a fear in them to
[2:44:07] step out and to be obedient in their own
[2:44:10] lives because they're caught up in the
[2:44:14] confusion of the
[2:44:17] atmosphere it's not just your family
[2:44:19] that I want us to consider and be
[2:44:22] concerned about it's other families as
[2:44:24] well when a confusing spirit is visiting
[2:44:28] and they
[2:44:29] do it can affect multiple people and
[2:44:33] multiple
[2:44:34] families it's the spirit of
[2:44:37] Babylon it operates politically and it
[2:44:41] operates
[2:44:43] religiously to control people's minds
[2:44:47] when you hear the foolish opinions of of
[2:44:51] liberals in this world and you say to
[2:44:53] yourself how could anybody be so stupid
[2:44:58] this is your answer it's spirits of
[2:45:02] confusion that constantly keep turmoil
[2:45:06] in the
[2:45:10] atmosphere just so you won't know what
[2:45:14] to
[2:45:15] think what to
[2:45:17] do I can see how the enemy uses
[2:45:20] confusion in this
[2:45:22] hour to paralyze spiritual
[2:45:26] growth have you ever talked to somebody
[2:45:28] and when you were through you didn't
[2:45:30] know any
[2:45:32] more at the end of your conversation
[2:45:34] than you did in the beginning you hoped
[2:45:37] to have a better understanding of where
[2:45:39] they were coming
[2:45:40] from but when they got through you were
[2:45:43] almost more confused than you were when
[2:45:45] you started and it's not because they're
[2:45:47] not eloquent it's it's not because
[2:45:49] they're not articulate it's because a
[2:45:51] spirit is in the atmosphere it it's that
[2:45:55] twisting Spirit the spirit that operates
[2:45:57] like
[2:45:58] leviathon that twists and confuses and
[2:46:03] bewilders and causes turbulence and
[2:46:06] turmoil and confusion and we just feel
[2:46:10] like we have to just sometimes take it
[2:46:12] but we
[2:46:13] don't because the Bible tells us in 1
[2:46:16] Corinthians
[2:46:17] 14:33 three let's stand a oh I already
[2:46:22] called the
[2:46:24] musicians for God say this with me for
[2:46:28] God not is not whoa whoa whoa for God is
[2:46:35] not the author of confusion
[2:46:41] hold is it
[2:46:44] confusing then God is not the author of
[2:46:48] The
[2:46:50] confusion God is not the author of
[2:46:53] confusion you
[2:46:55] know these Spirits I know you're
[2:46:59] standing good for
[2:47:01] you they they're they're
[2:47:04] so
[2:47:06] twisting now you know how I feel about
[2:47:09] through the years I have told you how I
[2:47:11] feel about questions and
[2:47:14] answers and I think some of it is a
[2:47:17] shame
[2:47:19] I I think it's a shame some of the
[2:47:22] questions that people ask brother
[2:47:25] brandham because there was no Clarity he
[2:47:28] didn't give any
[2:47:31] Clarity and they didn't leave with any
[2:47:34] Clarity and 50 years later people are
[2:47:37] still getting confused by
[2:47:40] it because people were trying really in
[2:47:45] some way to
[2:47:47] manipulate in some of these ridiculous
[2:47:49] questions a woman asked the prophet is
[2:47:52] it all right for a woman to shave her
[2:47:57] legs that's one of the dumbest questions
[2:47:59] that I've ever heard in my
[2:48:03] life and brother Brandon why he just him
[2:48:08] Halls remember he he was still probably
[2:48:11] trying to remember the difference
[2:48:12] between chiffon and
[2:48:15] rayon these are not things that people
[2:48:17] talked about
[2:48:19] I doubt his wife ever said William what
[2:48:22] do you Bill what do you think about
[2:48:24] should I shave my legs or not shave I
[2:48:26] doubt she ever discussed it with
[2:48:29] him it's a dumb
[2:48:33] question it's unnecessary it's wrong to
[2:48:37] put a profit in the middle of something
[2:48:40] that the Holy Spirit can answer to you
[2:48:44] for you in your life if you feel
[2:48:47] convicted of doing it don't do
[2:48:51] it if the I don't care what the quote
[2:48:54] said if the spirit of the Lord says to
[2:48:55] you that is not something that you ought
[2:48:58] to do don't you do
[2:49:02] it but if you are my
[2:49:06] wife and you sleep in the same bed that
[2:49:10] I sleep in and there's any
[2:49:13] possibility that my leg might touch
[2:49:17] yours I want my to be the hairy
[2:49:22] one these are personal
[2:49:27] matters you see how the enemy will take
[2:49:31] everything and try to confuse
[2:49:33] it women who wanted to wear makeup would
[2:49:36] ask brother brandham a question and he'd
[2:49:38] stumble around now when he was under
[2:49:41] that anointing he said it's Mrs dog
[2:49:46] meat but when he was B pushed in a
[2:49:49] question and answer really taken off
[2:49:51] guard he'd say well I I I I I I just you
[2:49:56] you you hear for yourself but I I just I
[2:49:59] if if you know if if a a
[2:50:02] woman if if she didn't have any color
[2:50:06] well well I guess it wouldn't hurt to to
[2:50:09] put a little
[2:50:12] color if she didn't have fingernails
[2:50:14] well I I guess it'd be all right for her
[2:50:17] to get some
[2:50:20] fingernails the brandom's giving you
[2:50:24] his humble
[2:50:27] opinion to tell me that every one of
[2:50:29] that every bit of that is thus sayith
[2:50:31] the Lord you're going to have to find
[2:50:33] somebody else to
[2:50:34] convince it's people trying to make a
[2:50:37] point and get him to answer the way that
[2:50:40] they really wanted him to answer so they
[2:50:42] could go and do what they wanted to do
[2:50:44] in the first place that is manipulation
[2:50:47] that was familiar your spirits operating
[2:50:50] even back then and the reality is a
[2:50:53] woman's going to do what she what she
[2:50:54] can get by with and so is a
[2:50:58] man come on and if I start telling
[2:51:00] people if you don't have long
[2:51:02] fingernails you can go get you some
[2:51:04] we'll have a church full of
[2:51:08] witches look at some of them
[2:51:13] today and and and I got a feeling that
[2:51:16] when he said if you didn't have color h
[2:51:18] you could maybe you know get a little I
[2:51:20] I feel sure he was talking about
[2:51:23] something that would would would be your
[2:51:25] flesh
[2:51:26] color I don't think he was talking about
[2:51:29] red
[2:51:31] lipstick and I don't think he was
[2:51:33] talking about all that thick stuff that
[2:51:36] people operate in now I don't think
[2:51:39] that's really what he was saying but you
[2:51:41] see it should have never been ask in the
[2:51:43] first place because we have a control
[2:51:47] tower amen
[2:51:49] let the Holy Spirit bring some
[2:51:52] conviction you look at yourself in the
[2:51:54] mirror and ask yourself why you're doing
[2:51:57] it who you're trying to please who
[2:52:00] you're trying to attract their attention
[2:52:02] and what's really going on that you
[2:52:03] don't feel good about yourself usually
[2:52:06] the answers are there and here's what he
[2:52:09] said to summarize it all and this you
[2:52:11] don't need to forget if you didn't hear
[2:52:13] anything else I said about these little
[2:52:15] Holiness issues please hear this one he
[2:52:17] said this if there's a question about
[2:52:22] it
[2:52:24] leave
[2:52:26] it
[2:52:29] alone so quote
[2:52:31] that if you're going to quote the
[2:52:33] fingernail quote this one too if there's
[2:52:36] a because some people don't have a
[2:52:38] question but some people do some people
[2:52:41] aren't sure and he said if you're not
[2:52:45] sure leave it
[2:52:47] alone and I I want to say this in
[2:52:49] closing if you're not sure if some of
[2:52:51] your behavior is being influenced by
[2:52:55] something other than the Holy Spirit and
[2:52:58] you're wondering if there's a
[2:52:59] possibility that some of this confusion
[2:53:01] and disruption and
[2:53:04] manipulation is because of the
[2:53:06] manifestation of a spirit you want to
[2:53:09] seek the Lord sincerely and humbly and
[2:53:13] you want to ask the Lord how he would
[2:53:15] have you to proceed in cutting off the
[2:53:18] INF inuence of that spirit and sending
[2:53:20] it not only out of your life but out of
[2:53:23] your family's
[2:53:25] life come on you don't want to be under
[2:53:29] the under the control of anything but
[2:53:33] him Lord here we
[2:53:35] are we stand in this house today your
[2:53:41] people a and we are not ashamed to offer
[2:53:45] you what we
[2:53:46] are because you you have worked such
[2:53:50] marvelous works of
[2:53:52] Grace in our
[2:53:55] lives yes Lord we sometimes recognize
[2:53:58] that we got a long way to
[2:54:00] go but we are so thankful for the
[2:54:06] journey you have revealed yourself you
[2:54:09] you have led us one step at a time to
[2:54:13] God be the
[2:54:15] glory we know that you have brought us
[2:54:18] the thus
[2:54:19] far and you will take us the rest of the
[2:54:22] way our hope is not in man our
[2:54:25] confidence is in you our trust is in you
[2:54:29] our hope is in you lead us by your Holy
[2:54:35] Spirit if anything else is affecting our
[2:54:38] Behavior Lord Jesus give us the grace to
[2:54:41] just just kick that out of the control
[2:54:43] room of our life not only do we not want
[2:54:47] to be control from the inside we don't
[2:54:49] want to be influenced from the outside
[2:54:52] by anything that is unclean by anything
[2:54:54] that is not like you by anything that is
[2:54:57] not really who we are but an outside
[2:55:00] influence trying to shape us we resist
[2:55:03] that right now somebody ought to feel
[2:55:05] that we resist that right now we resist
[2:55:09] anything trying to manipulate or control
[2:55:12] us from the outside we resist it in the
[2:55:16] name of Jesus Christ and we command that
[2:55:18] thing to flee from
[2:55:20] us we will shake ourselves and recognize
[2:55:25] the influence of the enemy in our lives
[2:55:27] and we will
[2:55:28] believe that you'll break us out of the
[2:55:31] box of constraint and you'll break us
[2:55:33] out of the box of of of being hindered
[2:55:36] and impeded in the name of
[2:55:39] Jesus and every Spirit that's trying to
[2:55:43] get between husbands and wives we take
[2:55:45] authority over that
[2:55:48] we call you
[2:55:50] out and we command you to take your
[2:55:53] influence and run you have no Authority
[2:55:56] in The Bride of Jesus Christ we bind
[2:55:59] together right now as the sons of God
[2:56:03] and we resist you Lord those of us who
[2:56:07] have fallen victim to using guilt or
[2:56:09] other tools to to control we pray God
[2:56:14] that you would show us
[2:56:16] today how we can divorce
[2:56:20] ourselves from that kind of
[2:56:23] spirit how we can recognize it not in
[2:56:26] others lives first but in our life
[2:56:29] first and cut off the very root
[2:56:34] is
[2:56:36] is
[2:56:38] yes
[2:56:42] Jesus Lord even young people even
[2:56:45] teenagers using these tricks on their
[2:56:48] own
[2:56:50] parents we ask that you would break that
[2:56:54] thing falling victim to generational
[2:56:58] iniquity and the spirits of manipulation
[2:57:01] and distraction we just pray right now
[2:57:04] that you would even deal with young
[2:57:06] people young teens maybe even children
[2:57:10] who have already learned how to yield
[2:57:15] yield to outside
[2:57:19] influence to get their way to control a
[2:57:24] situation I pray Lord in the name of
[2:57:26] Jesus that you would raise them up
[2:57:29] today to
[2:57:32] overcome every bit of that
[2:57:35] junk I Want You Lord to heal homes heal
[2:57:40] marriages heal
[2:57:42] relationships heal siblings
[2:57:45] relationships
[2:57:48] yes we recognize that the enemy is
[2:57:51] working over time to wedge us to divide
[2:57:55] us families particularly and we pray
[2:58:00] that your
[2:58:01] peace God you are not the author of
[2:58:05] confusion we resist it we reject it and
[2:58:10] we grab
[2:58:12] Clarity and purity of thoughts may your
[2:58:16] word be our guide May the Holy Ghost sit
[2:58:19] on the control tower of Our Lives break
[2:58:23] us out from under any form of
[2:58:26] slackness that we might March forward
[2:58:30] Lord that we might find as the prophet
[2:58:32] said our path of Duty may we kick off
[2:58:35] any
[2:58:36] distraction that would try to keep us
[2:58:39] from our path of Duty and run quickly
[2:58:41] back to your perfect will we pray Lord
[2:58:44] grant it be ready Grant it
[2:58:55] granted someone is thinking is it really
[2:58:58] that easy let me tell you something the
[2:59:00] hard part is recognizing it the hard
[2:59:05] part is recognizing it if you can
[2:59:08] recognize it in your family if you can
[2:59:11] recognize it in your life that is the
[2:59:14] hard part behind you the easiest part is
[2:59:18] to start breaking
[2:59:20] out somebody said I can't believe that
[2:59:22] well you can believe it it's absolutely
[2:59:24] the truth once you become aware that
[2:59:27] this is not just my personality that I
[2:59:29] was born with but the enemy is trying to
[2:59:31] rule my
[2:59:32] life you can start having better control
[2:59:35] over your own thoughts because you're
[2:59:37] putting the right one on the control
[2:59:42] tower and you some will discover that
[2:59:46] that you you you were thriving in an
[2:59:49] unhealthy environment because you were
[2:59:51] attracted to it but once that attraction
[2:59:53] is broken you'll start building a
[2:59:56] healthy environment a real healthy
[2:59:59] environment which will change your
[3:00:02] family it'll change your
[3:00:05] life when we get out from under the
[3:00:08] unhealthy and start moving in the
[3:00:12] healthy healthy relationships healthy

[3:07:20] Lord of all Lord of
[3:07:24] all just play that a moment we're going
[3:07:26] to close in just a second but at the end
[3:07:30] of this series I don't know when it will
[3:07:32] be I'm not sure exactly how many more
[3:07:34] services we have but at the end of it
[3:07:36] we're going to announ we're going to
[3:07:38] announce an anointing
[3:07:40] service and in that service whoever
[3:07:43] wants to be Anointed with oil and prayed
[3:07:46] over regarding the these kinds of things
[3:07:48] we will do
[3:07:50] it but you're going to have to have a
[3:07:52] little homework to get to get in the
[3:07:55] line and that is I want you to spend
[3:07:58] some time in prayer instead of hoping
[3:08:02] that I will tell you what the influence
[3:08:04] is why don't you ask the Lord to begin
[3:08:08] to talk to your heart oh he will he
[3:08:11] really will he really will he already is
[3:08:14] I hope let him talk to your heart and
[3:08:17] show you some of the things that you
[3:08:20] feel that that are hindering and that
[3:08:23] are Spirit involved not just personality
[3:08:27] Quirk but but a spirit trying to hinder
[3:08:30] your life your family your
[3:08:33] relationships and we will anoint with
[3:08:36] all and we will pray and the Saints will
[3:08:38] pray and we will
[3:08:40] believe that you'll find the full
[3:08:42] Freedom that you need somebody say what
[3:08:44] do I do in the meantime well you pray
[3:08:46] and you ask ask the Lord to show you
[3:08:48] what you need to do for
[3:08:51] yourselves and what's going on in your
[3:08:53] life and above all stay in the word and
[3:08:56] worship him every opportunity you can
[3:09:01] create a better
[3:09:03] atmosphere put better music
[3:09:09] on build a better
[3:09:11] atmosphere stay in the presence of the
[3:09:14] Lord as much as you can stay out of
[3:09:17] complicated situations as much as you
[3:09:21] can and let's believe that at the end of
[3:09:23] this we're going to have a freedom not
[3:09:26] only for us but for our kids for our
[3:09:30] children and our children's children
[3:09:31] Lord we're sincere before you just lift
[3:09:34] your hearts to him and your hands Lord
[3:09:37] we're sincere before you we don't want
[3:09:39] to go on a on some kind of hunt in our
[3:09:43] life but we want the spirit of the lord
[3:09:46] we want your Divine Spirit to give us
[3:09:49] some discernment to help us to recognize
[3:09:52] what may be going on we want peace in
[3:09:55] our own lives and we want peace for our
[3:09:58] families and we want peace in this house
[3:10:01] we don't want to yield to anything that
[3:10:03] is not of you so Lord we're believing
[3:10:05] that when this series is over and we
[3:10:07] come together for anointing and prayer
[3:10:09] that many of us are going to walk out of
[3:10:12] something that has kept us most of our
[3:10:15] lives and step into into some new
[3:10:18] freedom and and to and to some new
[3:10:20] Clarity we're believing Lord that
[3:10:23] confusion has to cease and and that we
[3:10:26] will find a a much quicker place to to
[3:10:30] know your mind and to know your
[3:10:33] will and sometimes we already
[3:10:37] know we just keep going in circles
[3:10:39] trying to reason it out but sometimes we
[3:10:42] already know what you want us to do Lord
[3:10:45] give us courage and Grace to do it in
[3:10:49] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[3:10:51] pray amen sing just a little bit more of
[3:10:54] that and worship him love one another
[3:10:57] and when you have slip back to your seat
