to give the Saints I wish this building were packed I wish all of our church people were here we have many that are out of town and some are fighting sickness sister Rebecca Shepherd also reached out

thankful that those who are not here will have an opportunity should they desire to hear it but I wish they could be here to hear it in person amen but I want to give you an opportunity to sow into his ministry they are here on a time of refreshing and holiday and leave it to us to make him work today but they have a few more weeks in the states and uh if we could just sew something in that would be a blessing to him his many many years of service to the Lord are outstanding in my mind today the very first time the message of Truth for this hour was preached in any church in Africa pastor Tay was sitting in that church in that service and his Pastor he was not pastoring but his Pastor the church that has grown out of that Bible Believers Fellowship has touched Many Many Nations and established I think I heard near nearly 40 churches in the surrounding nations of Africa and Pastor Tay has been faithful to the word now he not only knows the message and the quotes but he knows the Bible and that has been the theme of their Ministry for many many years and he is a man of of of limited stature in the natural but in the spirit he is a giant I'm telling you that and you're going to be blessed today so just so a little love gift toward his time here in the states would you do that he of course has come asking nothing father would you take our gifts today would you multiply them and bless them and we give unto you because we're giving to your servant to be a blessing to him and brother Jesse I pray Lord today that you would give it back press down shaken together and running over to every person who would would meet this challenge who would hear the call and sow into the work of the Lord and we will give you glory and honor and praise for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the Saints said amen sing this as you come what a lovely name let's just play right off of the theme of brother Solomon and sister Zion Song WoW [Music] that

Beautiful Jesus [Music] sister Kathy is celebrating a birthday this coming Saturday happy birthday sister Kathy a little bit ahead of time God bless you we're just thankful I'm just so thankful 29 years ago uh I started on a mission trip we sent two brothers 30 years ago this year we sent two brothers across the continent of Africa to meet the brothers many of whom had invited me to come and speak men that we had never met before and we sent two green men who had never been on the mission field before and we told everybody that we had contact with in that country this is our arrival time meet at the airport and well what a lot of confusion that could cause but I'm so thankful that among those men Pastor Tay was there to greet those brothers and to treat them with respect as though they were veterans and it was their very first trip on the mission field neither one of them had ever been out of the country and their Arrangements were made for me to come the following year and that will next year will be 30 years this year 29 years ago and I've never been treated in all the places that I've been in Africa I've never been welcomed respected and treated quite like I am when I am at home at the Tema Church in Ghana West Africa when I say these things I mean them from the bottom of my heart today a general is Among Us and I mean that and I'm so thankful I'm so thankful for men who love the word of God and who will not follow the cultish tendencies of those around this message but a man who will stay right on the word no matter what the cost and he has survived every wave of fanaticism that has struck Ghana every interpretation of the Thunders has struck Ghana every thought about the seventh seal has struck Ghana and there has been one man one church and now many sister churches and many ministers who stand with him if the I heard him say it yesterday we spent several hours of Bible study with him in my office yesterday is it okay to say what you said when we were getting ready to leave brother Greeley said I see I've got a lot to learn and I said me too me too to be able to sit with someone and just be taught the scripture it's life to me and I am so honored and so thankful they have celebrated every victory in my life when Benjamin was born they went to the pulpit and announced his birth and the people cheered when before that let me let me say before that when they announced my wedding the people cheered and as each of the children come along they celebrated that and that means something to me so I'm taking the time but it's not easy to say these things to Pastor directly because he's a humble man and he will brush us off if we say anything like this but I just feel honored I just feel yeah I'm emotional but I feel honored I want God to speak to us and as always he uses human flesh human instrumentality to give us Divine truth that'll transform Our Lives I want you to sing with me only believe all things are possible as we welcome our brother Pastor John Tay to come and give us the word of the Lord amen oh oh [Music] only believe oh [Music] thanks are possible [Music] [Music] [Music] all right [Music] [Music] Lee Jesus is here

problems with the female movement in the U.S God is looking for men and women [Music] who can climb up into the height like an eagle taking our flight and go plan into the heaviness up yonder where all things uh are possible Hallelujah precious ones in the Book of Daniel chapter 11 and verse 32. the last sentence they that know their God shall be strong and do exploits yea the word of the Lord

you know the first creation was the Angelic family the second creation was the first Adam and now the third creation let me say the last Adam I don't want to bring about something and say the second Adam to give somebody the chance to say William Branham is the third Adam so permit me to say Adam the first Adam and Jesus the last Adam so no room for you to bring the third and the fourth and the fifth amen now be part of that new third creation that gives you the Divine connection you are divinely connected to deity and I am here to declare unto you that when he or she who is born again filled with the Holy Spirit takes that word into his or her heart and put that word on his or her lips that is deity speaking I didn't hear a lot of Amen deity amen deity or deity depending from which continent you came from Hallelujah you feel with the Holy Spirit taking that word into your heart in that word on your lips when you speak that is deity speaking no devil can stand before you somebody here today no mountain can stand before you and I'm here to declare to somebody that from today you are going to display the power [Music] in your life Hallelujah now when you look at let me get over

the one inside you is a Divine potential a treasure so that you will now impact Before you depart what God has deposited in you hear the word of the Lord today [Music] impact [Music] Before you depart [Applause] there is treasure in you so that you will be a dealer of Hope to the Hopeless amen not only that listen the time for submarine Christianity is over did you hear it we have people today who are submarine Christians [Music] but I want to remind you that you are light and you are on top of the hill so from today you must be a giver a dealer of Hope to the Hopeless in this nation in your community you might be a game changer in your family you are a game changer in your family in your neighborhood in your nation amen brothers and sisters if you watch when we come to Second Kings chapter four we come across a woman who had two Sons but had no money then there's another woman who had money but no child hmm and there was a cluster a container a vessel called Elijah and Elisha came across these two women one children no money one money no job and Elisha was a dealer of Hope before a dealer of Hope leaves anyone he meets there must be hope somebody didn't get it from today whosoever will come across you or you come across somebody that somebody must go back with hope [Music] that somebody must go back blessed [Music] the time for enter message people meeting people and sending them to hell they have so much revelation until they know who is serpent seed and who is not serpent seed but I am here to declare to you that from today in whatever condition anyone will be in when that person meets you the person must live with hope I didn't hear a louder amen from somebody that is what God Made You that is the reason for the anointing a man thank you thank you now if you watch fast Samuel chapter 17. and verse 43 there was a situation in the church where Pastor saw was the pastor a problem in the nation Goliath came up preaching throwing challenge or pastor's soul give me one man Nation Israel give me one man and the whole church from the pastor from the pulpit to the pew everybody had to take cover fear for 40 days golat had a free show yeah but today I'm here to declare to you God has not given you the spirit of fear [Applause] [Music] so refuse what God has not given you but he has given you the spirit of and of sound mind [Applause] somebody here with any problem in your mind hear the word of the Lord a dealer of Hope is right before you and you are going to leave this place with a testimony [Music] Hallelujah the whole of the church the nation fear but praise the Lord at God's time Little David came up and he had the preaching the message of Goliath and he looked around where are the Believers where are they miracles of god where are the signs and the Miracles he went to Elliot what is happening in the church helium said shut up [Music] a young man like you when did you come into the message [Music] we have been in a message for the past 101 years of the message little did they know that the age of Methuselah has nothing to do with the wisdom of Solomon Hallelujah and David had to turn away from eliab brother sister don't from today permit somebody to limit the potentials God has deposited in you [Music] don't stop there let no discouragement stop you [Applause] turn to the next one what is happening turn to the next one brother you are unstoppable [Music] until what God to King Saul let him come David went there what where we want men in the battle this small boy what what what do you have what do you know where are you from who are you are you able David said King would you respect I know King you know bear and I know you fear bear and I know Goliath Fierce bear I have a testimony I have killed bear and golet fierce bed not only that [Music] King you fear lion is that not [Music] lion but I have a testimony [Applause] that I have killed lion [Music] so look at David you know what I'll let you go to Bible College um to update your etiquette in preaching David tried it the armor he could not move the sword of salt was to was longer or taller than David I have not proved it amen are you able they will say you hold on that was the time and the challenge that will put David in his royalty so David went I don't know how you call it in the U.S catapult is that the same word good you know we were taught the Queen's language those over here you left the Queens country and you came here and you believe that you must be the first among the equals so if the prince country the switch off the light like this we would do it like this if the Queen's country The Junction it is stop we will use yield that great so David went got five stones people will say the five stand for Jesus okay that is your language if your language Jesus has five letters that's okay but some countries the name Jesus has no five letters some will say it is faith that's up to you but David had revelation that at that time there were five giants [Music] and God made the provision for David to overcome all the existing Giants and God has already declared you and overcomer so in your life of Destiny God had made the provision that you are going to end up as an overcomer [Music] the Giant saw Little David he laughed a laughter of discouragement sister brother you are going to meet discouragement on your life Destiny Journey at the entire message can produce is that why the church can produce this young this small boy but he didn't know that inside that small structure was a giant and I'm here today to let the spirit of God wake up the Giant in you there's Giant in you there's Giant in you [Music] golak spoke words and then David took the challenge David said I shall Smite you from today don't play with words what have Spirits behind them and I want to declare to somebody you are an eaglet the anointing for this age is prophetic anointing a flying eagle and that anointing was not limited to only the prophet William Branham when you watch the four beasts and watch the four beasts that the Lord also raised the lion that anointing was not only on power [Music] even women they were having the anointing of lion when you come to the next horse the red horse the anointing what the faith of the cars it wasn't only on the prophet or the messenger it was on the Believers too you are happy I'm saying that but when I come to the end time I want to hear a louder amen when you go to the black horse rider the anointing was the face of man to meet that spirit are you here in this age of the gray or the pale horse rider the anointing is the flying eagle [Applause] prophetic anointing and that anointing was not only limited to the prophet and I'm here to declare unto you that that anointing is upon you too it may not be the same measure but if you have a cup this is water I believe it is not holy water in Africa they have a bunch of holy water they have drug and drug and it has not made them holy praise the Lord it's only Jesus who had or had the fullness of the spirit in the prophet was a measure and he said the same anointing measure in you also that is one good thing about the prophet he didn't portray himself as super human just like one of you but the gift of God makes the difference so that if if you have a small drop of this water in you is the same Jesus in you Hallelujah brother sister I've come to declare to you that let's bring Jesus from history to today maybe somebody didn't hear don't make Jesus a historical God he's the same yesterday and today and today and today the same Jesus the Same power the same anointing the same lie the same size the same Miracles or somebody shouted louder amen [Applause] same Jesus is here today in the first Exodus Moses the servant of God died and died missed diet but Yahweh of the Old Testament was not dead [Music] God's Not Dead [Music] God not dead he shall love God is not dead he feel him in my heart [Music] [Applause] why me Hallelujah somebody amen amen [Applause] the same Yahweh who spoke to Moses the same Yahweh spoke to Joshua the same God who spoke to the prophet I'm here to declare to you that the same God is talking today is speaking today amen you know the problem watch Elisha Elisha was following Elijah when you see me go then you are going to receive an answer to your request there were some prophets around preaching God will take away your master today forgettable and you are dead come and join me here on your Christian Journey don't let something side tracked you Focus your eyes on when you see me go then Charles of fire came and Elijah was taken up but something happened the mantle dropped Elijah didn't take the mantle away the matter dropped the mantle dropped the Mata dropped and Elijah picked a matter and you know what you know it but I'm reminding you why did you say what is Elijah today people what is the prophet what is the prophet where is the prophet going to they have left watching the word watching The Rock and they are running in every direction where is the brother brother where is the brother Abraham where has gone to impedimental where is the Lord God of Elijah [Applause] Hallelujah it was not difficult to locate the Lord God of Elijah the problem is who are we going to find to locate that Lord God and I tried the Lord that somebody here today you are the one you are going to locate the Lord God I didn't hear amen from somebody he paid the matter the anointing the power and I'm here to declare to you that that same power that same Jesus that same miracle science and wonders the supernatural is around today brother sister now David poke I'm going to cut off your head yeah what the word of Prophecy he wasn't having any knife no sword but he's prophesied I'm going to cut your head and as soon as he header he said that God in the realm of the spirit has made provision Gola spoke words David spoke words remember words went before a stone words let your words change your world was down David stood on him the prophecy of David I will cut your head the weapon was provided brother sister inside you today there is that sayeth the Lord yes the word is in you you have that say yes the Lord and I'm here to declare there's going to be a testimony of you getting in the channel of the Holy Spirit and you prophesy you speak and it will come to pass if you know you are the one and you shout another amen [Applause] David one stone brother gulat now watch some two people were looking through a window Darkness all over one of them
