Description:
We all, every one of us will be judged; not by the world’s pattern or anyone else’s standard, we will be judged by God’s pattern.  There is a difference between the Bride and the Church.  In this season He comes to her with His silver redemption and judges His Bride.  She willingly submits herself and yields to His judgment in humility and obedience.  

One day, at the White Throne Judgment, she will take her position as His Bride, and stand by His side to judge the Church and the nations.
