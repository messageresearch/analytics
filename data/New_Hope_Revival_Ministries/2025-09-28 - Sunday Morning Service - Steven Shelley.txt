You keep all of your promises. We give you praise for it, Lord. How great you are. Hallelujah. What a promisekeeper he is. &gt;&gt; High and above every other one that has ever said they will keep a promise. My Lord keeps his promises. Hallelujah. Do you have a need that you'd like us to remember just by the lifting of the hand as we're getting ready to pray today? All over the building, there are needs. The Lord sees the needs that you have. Even the ones that you didn't raise your hand, the Lord sees your need. Out across that camera, God sees your need. He knows best how to meet that need. I have a list. I'll try to hurry. We had a a phone call last evening from Sister Jennifer Wartz. Brother Bobby really needs our prayers today, &gt;&gt; not tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes, we'll pray tomorrow. But &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; I wanted to stress the emphasis of praying particularly strong for him today. &gt;&gt; He needs a miracle. His body is growing weak and he needs strength that only comes from the Lord. Let's continue every day to pray for Sister Williams that God will completely give her strength to press through. She's been in wonderful spirits this week and we're thanking God for that. But she stands in need of a miracle. Sister Alfreda reached out and she's been able to uh change her ticket sort of at the last minute, come home a little early for to be with us for communion, but she has asked that we would pray. I'm sure they're streaming. Sister Lydia, her sister. I I uh I think it's a little rude, Sister Lydia, to tell people's age, especially a lady, but I think it's quite a milestone. And on October the 1st, Sister Lydia Whitmer will be 90 years old. &gt;&gt; And uh God has been so good to her. &gt;&gt; So good. &gt;&gt; And Sister Adena also stands in needs of need of prayer. She's north of that number. And uh brother uh Bernie has been real good to keep me posted along the way of her condition. She is a saint and she's a precious child of God. She needs the strength of the Lord. We are so thankful for two new uh members of the New Hope Revival Ministry family. Brother Luke and Sister Megan have had their beautiful twins. Adasa is the girl and Isaac is the boy. Uh uh one was six pounds. Uh &gt;&gt; um &gt;&gt; the the girl was six. &gt;&gt; The girl was six pounds and Isaac was six and 6.5. They're concerned about him somewhat because they think he may have swallowed some amniotic uh fluid and he is uh in the uh the Niku ward. uh with some assistance for his breathing. His lungs are not all the way there yet, but I tell you, I I felt like God broke through 4:00 this morning. I felt like God broke through in prayer. I believe I believe that this is going to turn very quickly. &gt;&gt; I believe the enemy is a liar &gt;&gt; and I believe this is going to turn very quickly and God's going to raise up those precious. I mean, you know, that's pretty outstanding that they are 6 and 6.5 lbs and and early. God's good. The babies were not in in uh someone asked, "No, the babies were not in any uh sort of risk, but it was taking a toll on Sister Megan's body, and she was getting in a in a situation uh where they thought it was probably time to come in and and help things along." Brother Michael said that Sister Crystalin is not well in Adelaide and Lydia. they could use our prayers. A little maybe fever coming in and out and sinus infection. Brother Truman and Sister Martha are making a long quick trip all the way to Missouri and back in a very short few hours. Uh and we want to cover them in prayer this week. I want you to ask the Lord for his help and strength, deliverance. Uh raise them up, Zach and Michaela and Carter. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Uh I've prayed for them and I know you have every day this week believing God to move in their lives. And we heard today from brother and sister Ryder that they're uh going to make it indeed for camp meeting coming next Sunday. So we want to pray that the Lord will uh certainly give them traveling mercies as well. He's got it all in his great big capable hands. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Yes. Let's take these needs to the Lord. &gt;&gt; Lots to pray about. &gt;&gt; Lots to pray about. But I know God is able to accomplish every bit of it by his grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is able more than able to accomplish what concerns me today. He is able, more than able to handle anything that comes my way. He is able more than able to do much more than I could ever dream. He is able more than able to make me what he wants me to be. Brother Daniel, will you come? He is able, more than able to accomplish what concerns me today. He is able, more than able to handle anything that comes my way. He is able more than able to do much more than I could ever dream. He is able more than a God is more than able &gt;&gt; what he wants me to be. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord Jesus, we testify you're more than able, God. There's no enemy you've ever faced that you did not overcome. There's no plan that you've not made that won't be accomplished. Lord, the list of the names and the things that were read before you today, Lord, I hold in my hand my weak mind. Sometimes I can't even grasp it all, God. But there's nothing that you can't handle. &gt;&gt; You've been meeting us week in and week out, Lord. You've been the your presence on the campground has been so rich and it's been so sweet. And this week, Lord, you gave us rain and the grass is green and it's reaching for what you sent. And God, we're reaching today because we know there's only one that can make a way for us. There's only one true provider. There's only one overcomer and it's you, oh God. &gt;&gt; So help our weaknesses, Lord. Help us to not put expectations on you that would limit you, Lord. May would the walls come down, may the boxes be torn apart, oh God. And may we expect the unexpectable this coming days and weeks, Lord. May the miracles pour out, oh God. May the slle gates be open. May you pour on us, oh God. For you're more than able, oh God. &gt;&gt; You're more than able, oh God. Breathe life into those that are weak today, Lord. May they feel your presence. May the holy hush of angels wings. Fill their rooms, Lord. May they know that the host of heaven is near. &gt;&gt; Lord, will you speak peace? When the enemy begins to speak, Lord, would you just but hold up your hand though that he'll shut his mouth. May the eargates be closed to the words of the enemy. May we not see anything that will allow doubt in our life. But oh God, may we be vigilant in your presence that we will lay hold of the promises of the word of God that pertain to us. And may we testify, I am an overcomer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you for what you're doing in this body, Lord. Thank you for what you've done in your bride. Thank you for truth, Lord. Thank you for eyes sav. Thank you for ear sav. Thank you for a mind to understand. Thank you for a heart that is willing. Oh God, we surrender all to you and we look to you. We look to no man, oh God. We don't trust as David or one of the psalmists wrote, Lord. We don't trust in chariots and horses. We don't trust in our own strength, oh God. We trust in the name of our God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We stand fast in you today and we say thank you that we can come before you. Thank you for the price you paid at Calvary. Thank you for the stripes you bore. Our war is over. Oh God, we surrender to you, Lord. Oh, continue to do what you're doing, Lord. &gt;&gt; We ask it in the lovely name of our savior Yeshua, the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Oh, praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Glory, glory to the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You may have your seats today, precious. &gt;&gt; What a wonderful privilege it is for us to be in the house of the Lord, gathered with saints of God who, like precious faith, want to worship with all their heart. Jacob, sure good to see you today. This young lady here with you. God bless you. We're glad that you're here. May the Lord bless you and speak to your heart while you're here. Jonathan, it's good to see you, buddy. And God bless you. We're glad that you're here today. Sister Dorothy, it's always good to have you in the house of the Lord with us. God bless you today. Every one of you home folk, we're so glad that you're in the house of the Lord and so thankful that the Lord has strengthened you this week. Brother Kate is going to slip over to the piano. We're going to continue to worship the Lord as we give of our tithe and offering, giving for the work of the Lord. God is so faithful. He has blessed us. He has provided for us and he's provided for what we have need of on this uh campground and in this ministry. And uh just a bit of housekeeping. They tell me, I have not seen it, but they tell me that somewhere back there there is a list of of uh things that need to be done inside of the church building as far as cleaning, getting ready for camp meeting. We're just uh uh slightly over a week until camp meeting starts. And so we want the the building to be clean and presentable for all of those that are coming in. The that we just want it to be clean for the Lord. &gt;&gt; We want to make sure that it's the best for him. &gt;&gt; And uh Brother Daniel mentioned to me that he would like to have a a group of guys to clean the ditch line just before it's done. Yeah. But they'll throw some more out before it's over with. So, we'll we'll go over it again. But the reason I was going to say that is because for about one hour on Saturday morning, if I could have a group of guys that we could clean up a little bit uh under the uh tabernacle side there where there's so much stuff, if we can just get some of it moved kind of out of the way so it doesn't look so sloppy as we're driving down there. It'll just take a little bit of time, not a whole lot of time. and and we're in expectation of what God is is doing and what he's going to do. &gt;&gt; And we're in such expectation that we are not planning for it to be over when camp meeting is over. &gt;&gt; And so when camp meeting is over, we're going to start doing some deconstruction in anticipation of expansion down there. We want to be ready for whatever God wants to do. And however he wants to do it, when he wants to do it, we want to be ready. &gt;&gt; So, we want to we want to put our our hand to the plow, so to speak. But, uh, this coming Saturday for just about I think we could do it in an hour and we can clean that some of that stuff up down there just to make it look a little better for camp meeting. And so, uh, with that said, let's receive the tithe and the offering. We want to give as unto the Lord. Brother Michael, could I call on you and brother Ellias today to go to the people for the tithe and the offering? As our brother is is singing, we're worshiping with him in our hearts preparing for the preaching of the word. I believe the Lord has something he wants to say to us today. Amen. That's why we came. God bless you as you give to the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus. [Music] Somebody here needs an answer to the questions, the fears, and the wise. Somebody here is desperate for freedom from the past and the chains and the lies. Feels like you wasted so much time. Want to move ahead, but you're still lasting life.

I just held on. &gt;&gt; Holding on to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord. I just held on. [Music] &gt;&gt; You're good, master. You're good. &gt;&gt; I just held on. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. We say again that when we can't hold on to you, we're thankful, Lord, that you can hold on to us. &gt;&gt; Father, may we make up our mind? &gt;&gt; It's late. It's very late, very late in the hour. &gt;&gt; Not not not the time today, but but the end times are upon us. &gt;&gt; And we're coming into the last of the last and we want to be ready to meet the Lord. 99 and a half 99 and a half will not do. &gt;&gt; It's 100%. &gt;&gt; It's giving God everything. It's pursuing him with your whole heart. Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh, I wish people would listen. &gt;&gt; I wish they would listen to wisdom. I wish they would listen to advice. Lord &gt;&gt; so they don't have to learn the hard way. &gt;&gt; 99 and a half won't do. &gt;&gt; You've got to give him everything. &gt;&gt; Isn't he worth? Doesn't he deserve it? Isn't he worthy? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The word of God, his word is life to us &gt;&gt; and it must take preeminence in our lives. &gt;&gt; Not just on Sunday morning, &gt;&gt; Tuesday night, but every day. &gt;&gt; His word. Lord, &gt;&gt; his word. It's more vital, more important than a hunting video or a racing video or a video game. &gt;&gt; People stay on them all night long on a Saturday night, &gt;&gt; come to church and sleep through the service. That's just not That's just not 100%, is it? &gt;&gt; No. No, no. We've got to give him everything. &gt;&gt; And he's ready. He's ready. &gt;&gt; I'm glad he's here this morning. &gt;&gt; We invited him here. &gt;&gt; How many of you believe God's hearing and answering prayer? &gt;&gt; Give the Lord another hand clap of praise. Worthy. Worthy. Hallelujah. God does not draw us so that we can spend our life in some denominational system. &gt;&gt; He delivers us so that we can serve him &gt;&gt; and believe his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the only overcoming only way to overcome is to embrace the fullness of God's word. Not a piece of it or a portion of it. It's not joining the church. The right hand of fellowship doesn't bring you in and the right Buddha fellowship can't kick you out. &gt;&gt; We're talking about the church of the firstborn. &gt;&gt; You're born into it by the spirit. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; By water, &gt;&gt; by baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; and by blood, &gt;&gt; his precious lifegiving blood. Wasn't this wonderful this morning? All this worship. Let's thank God for these musicians. Hallelujah. Turn in your Bible while you're standing to Leviticus chapter 16 this morning. And I know that with the spirit of God moving like that, it's might be a little hard to for you to settle to the word, but let's do it because that's why we're here. And uh I I feel him and I know he's doing something good and deep and wonderful and we give him the praise. &gt;&gt; Uh the all the best that you and I can do is just yield to him. &gt;&gt; If you know anyone who needs a hotel for camp meeting, October the 1st is the absolute deadline for the discounted rates. and they're already uh you you already have to kind of move around a little bit to get uh to get what you're looking for and but they're still available until October the 1st. If if you hear of this week someone coming in just for the banquet, October the 1st is the deadline for the for the catering, we have to let them know. We can't expect them to, you know, just come on a loose number. And so we're working toward that. All the work that's gone on around here has been absolutely incredible. The campground looks better than it's looked in many, many years. An old friend of mine stopped by this week. Hadn't been here in a long time on the property. He said, "This place is shining. It looks absolutely beautiful." Thank you, every one of you, for what you've done. We believe God has a great great plan. Camp meeting is going to be a a Moab. It's going to be a divine appointment. Let's believe that he will move among us in outstanding ways. &gt;&gt; Are you here? &gt;&gt; I believe it. Leviticus chapter 16, uh, beginning in verse 29. And this shall be a statute forever unto you. I don't know what that says to you, but I'll tell you what it says to me. Uh there will never be a time that there will not be reflection on what God is about to say. When I read that this is a everlasting statute or uh uh something along those lines, I know that God is about to reveal even in Old Testament. He's about to reveal a pattern that's going to go with us through type and shadow, through reality and antityype. and it's going to go all the way through even into millennium and eternity with us. Now, that is a pretty important aspect of our faith. Would you agree? This shall be a statute forever unto you, that in the seventh month, that's where we are on the Hebrew calendar right now, on the 10th day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country or a stranger that sojourneth among you. For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you to cleanse you that you may be clean from all of your sins before the Lord. It shall be a Sabbath of rest unto you and you shall afflict your soul by a statute for for how long? &gt;&gt; Forever. It didn't say until grace. It says forever. &gt;&gt; I believe God knows what he's saying. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't you? Amen. &gt;&gt; And the priest whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall consecrate to minister in the priest's office, in his father'sstead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen clothes, even the holy garments. He shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary. That means even the house, even the tent has to be sanctified, dedicated, anointed, cleansed, set apart. When we pray for God to move among us, we pray not only for lives and for breathing individuals, but we pray for the room. We pray for the building. We pray for the grounds. &gt;&gt; And we say, Lord, let every part of it be sanctified &gt;&gt; and set apart holy unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; This again, this holiness unto the Lord goes with us not only through millennium, but all the way even into eternity. He shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary. He shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation and for the altar. He's going to offer blood on behalf of the altar. &gt;&gt; The altar is not lost. It's not a It's not an offering of redemption. It's an offering of dedication. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's an offering of setting something apart under the service of the Lord. How many of you want to be dedicated? Yes. &gt;&gt; I want to be dedicated to the service of the Lord &gt;&gt; set apart unto him &gt;&gt; and the altar. For the altar he shall make an atonement for the priests and for all the people &gt;&gt; of the congregation. And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year. and he did as the Lord commanded Moses. I know you're standing, but I want you to turn quickly to the New Testament and then we'll have a quick prayer. Hebrews 9 verses 6 and 7. Now when these things were thus ordained, the priest went always into the first tabernacle accomp accomplishing the service of God. That is from the congregation, the tabernacle of the congregation, the outer court into the holy place. But unto or into the second went which is the holy of holies or the most holy place. But into the second went the high priest alone. Alone. Say that with me. Alone. &gt;&gt; Alone. &gt;&gt; Once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself. And that's first. And for the errors, for the transgressions of the people. Can you see that? &gt;&gt; I tell you, we're we're blessed. We're blessed today &gt;&gt; because God set an order in the old covenant. He fulfilled in reality that order in the new covenant. And today, as we walk in the outer skirts of the kingdom, we're coming into kingdom. And we can see the kingdom. It's so close that by eyes of faith and spirit, we can see the kingdom. We're nearly there. I'm not talking about heaven. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a new government, &gt;&gt; a new spiritual order, &gt;&gt; and we're closer than we've ever been before. There is no time for playing around. &gt;&gt; Hear the warning of the Lord. &gt;&gt; There's no time for playing around. &gt;&gt; Are you mad? I'm not mad at all. The zeal of the Lord's house once again has consumed me. &gt;&gt; The most important thing in my life today is serving the king. and making forward movement into the kingdom. I don't care about much else. &gt;&gt; Of course, people, family, loved ones, saints. Yes, we're we're deeply connected. It's part of the Kingdom March, but we have to get a goal, a vision, something in front of our eyes that we can look to in the spirit because what you look to in the spirit is what you become in in in reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You understand? We're not gazing any longer through a dark glass. &gt;&gt; We're not looking at Jesus anymore through the lattice. &gt;&gt; But the bridegroom has stepped out from behind the lattice. &gt;&gt; And the and the mirror is clear. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We went to the mirror. I know you're standing. &gt;&gt; We went to the mirror expecting to see our sin. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; We went to the mirror expecting to see where we had aired from the from the instruction of God. &gt;&gt; But because of the unveiling, because of the apocalypsis, sir, &gt;&gt; because Jesus now stands in full view, the word has been revealed. &gt;&gt; And because of that, when we went to the mirror expecting to see how far short we were, we saw another image. &gt;&gt; Amen. We saw something else in the mirror. We saw his perfection. &gt;&gt; We saw his blessed face. &gt;&gt; And we realized our only hope was to look unto that, look to that, look unto that until we become that. &gt;&gt; And uh so that the hour of seeing our transgression in the mirror, that's finished. &gt;&gt; And now we're seeing perfection there. &gt;&gt; Not ours. His &gt;&gt; his not our righteousness, &gt;&gt; his &gt;&gt; not our perfect his &gt;&gt; not our worthiness &gt;&gt; his. &gt;&gt; If he cared enough to show up in your mirror, &gt;&gt; I'm using all the terminologies of New Testament. &gt;&gt; If he cared enough to show up in your mirror, you belong to him. And if you'll spend enough time looking into that great mirror, seeing the perfe &gt;&gt; seeing the perfection of Christ, &gt;&gt; you'll feel the change. &gt;&gt; It's upon us. Father, we cannot thank you enough. We don't have enough words in our vocabulary. Perhaps there's not even enough words in the English language to thank you for the day and hour in which we're living. Lord, if we were only focused on what's happening out there, we would see that planet Earth is facing the darkest days of her existence. If we only looked outside of this building to see our nation, we would see that our nation is in the darkest hour in a and moving very quickly into total chaos and insanity. But we're not focused out there. We're focused in here. We're focused on the word. We're focused on the unveiling uh uh this great plan of redemption, the masterpiece, the real masterpiece. The logos became flesh. &gt;&gt; Oh my. And in that flesh, God was revealed. The entirety of who he is was revealed. It was manifested in the body word, the body flesh of our Lord Jesus Christ. We're here today to to hear and to be changed. We're here today to look unto and be changed. I take authority only in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Power and authority of the word and in his precious blood over every distracting spirit. And we just command you to bow. We we're not trying to cause you to bow to human flesh. We're commanding you to bow to the authority of the word of God, the authority of the name of Jesus, the authority of his precious blood. And we call right now that every spirit that has been uh re regenerated by your Holy Spirit, we call that spirit to come forward in the precious name of Jesus Christ and receive daily bread right now, right here. and leave here strengthened. And we'll give all the glory, the honor, and the praise where it belongs, &gt;&gt; not to man, but unto thee, precious Yeshua, our salvation. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. And the saint and don't you come with no pitiful amen. And the saints of God said, &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you. Thank you for for giving that honor to the word of God. I I believe I believe this word is is worthy of that little bit of honor standing up just a few minutes a and it's just a way of just saluting the fact that we not only have the living word among us which is the most important the reality of the life of Jesus Christ living in the individual believer is one of the greatest things that we could ever talk about and experience but it's also a great blessing to the bride in this last day to have the written form of the word &gt;&gt; aren't you glad to have some words to read on a page and to be able to underline them and highlight them and draw errors to them and and reread them and memorize them and and commit them to memory as I said and meditate on them. My God has been good to us. He has made a way for you and I to get out of Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride is pulling herself through the last little hold of Leodysia. Just the last one. Just the last one. The only hold Leodysia has on you would be in that mind, will and emotion realm and flesh realm. But you're pulling unto Christ. And the more we pull unto him, the less hold that the spirit of the age of Leodysia can have on any of us. &gt;&gt; And the kingdom starts pulling us on. Uh as brother as the Lefontaine wrote, I feel the pull. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, I feel the pull. &gt;&gt; I feel the pull. &gt;&gt; What is the pull? It's a kingdom pull. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a pull to take us out of the of the closing hours of the spirit of the age, Leodysia, and to place us in kingdom. &gt;&gt; Uh Jesus talks about this kingdom. And he's been building it a long time. And it's not built with brick and mortar. It's not built with 2x4s and hammers. It's built a holy habitation. It's a It's built with lively stones. It's built with those things that have been resuscitated and resurrected by the spirit of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Once we were dead. Once we were dead. Once we had no hope. Once we had no power against sin. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Sin ruled. Sin reigned in us. &gt;&gt; We didn't have time to think about the world. All we knew is that sin was ruling in us. But thanks be to God. &gt;&gt; Thanks be to God. He made the way. &gt;&gt; He not only made the way, he became the way. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Let's look to Hebrews chapter 10. We were just in chapter nine. We're going now to Hebrews chapter 10. Wednesday evening uh of this coming week as the sun goes down. Then we are indeed looking at the 10th day of the month of Tish which in in Judaism is called Yam Kapour. In the Bible it's the atonement. And you know, we have a lot to be thankful for because uh to the church, to to the nominal Christian, atonement is salvation. &gt;&gt; It's it's about all that that denominational Christianity can grasp. But for the bride, atonement is more than just salvation. &gt;&gt; Atonement is redemption. &gt;&gt; And atonement is more than just redemption. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Wait a minute. It's getting bigger as we go." It sure is. As I have taught you and preached to you for years, it is at onement. &gt;&gt; A t o n e m n t. Atonement is at onement. Meaning that he has not only made a way to save you and I from the clutches of sin and death and hell, but he has provided a way to take us all the way back. This is redemption. all the way back to the original thoughts that God had about you before we messed up &gt;&gt; his original plan. &gt;&gt; And that's redemption. But there's something more than that. There's another step in this bridal paradigm. And that is he has made a way through his own divine atonement to make you and I come into a place of union and agreement with him. a bond of relationship that is so strong that no devil in hell, not even the prince of devils, has the ability to take you out of that place of union and oneness. &gt;&gt; It begins as a state of mind. It begins as a determined thought process. It begins, as the old-timer used to say, I've made up my mind. It's just that simple. I've made up my mind. And then when you continue to rehearse the promises of God concerning these things, faith begins to bud. &gt;&gt; And when faith begins to bud, you begin to believe. I mean, you really start believing this is my inheritance. &gt;&gt; And the next thing that comes is you begin to speak it. &gt;&gt; It's not until you confess it. It's not until you speak it that it can even become a full reality in your life. &gt;&gt; It'll line you up, brother. &gt;&gt; It'll line you up. &gt;&gt; At onement will line you up. &gt;&gt; To be one with the word means totally surrendered. &gt;&gt; That means holiness. &gt;&gt; That means turning your back on the fads and the fashions of this old world. &gt;&gt; Amen. And making up your mind. You better be careful. I'm telling you, you better be careful in this hour because there are a lot of folks that ain't going to make that decision. There's a lot of folks that aren't going to go all the way. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of folks that are just going to play around in the baby pool of religion and some kind of church annity. But there are those who are not going to stop until they're one with him. &gt;&gt; The potential is there. The way in is there. &gt;&gt; And and what we're waiting on now is just maturity to come. And it won't fall on us like ripe cherries. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; No sire. Heaven. What am I going to say next? Suffereth &gt;&gt; violence. I've heard people try to play with that verse and make it a lot weaker than it really is. &gt;&gt; They're so afraid in this hour that somebody's going to take that the wrong way. They do. &gt;&gt; The cult world does. The o cult may. some some uh you know watered down versions of Christianity, they may take that as though they think you're physically going to fight your way. This is not a physical fight. &gt;&gt; This is not physical violence. &gt;&gt; This is determination and a madeup mind using the weapons that God's given us to push back the devil. &gt;&gt; Heaven suffereth violence &gt;&gt; and the violent &gt;&gt; and the violent &gt;&gt; take it &gt;&gt; by force &gt;&gt; by force. Somebody said, "What in the world does that mean?" Jesus said, "I give you the kingdom." He absolutely did. But standing between you and your inheritance of the kingdom is the same old devil. &gt;&gt; The same old devil that's hindered you every step of the way. &gt;&gt; He will not lay down and play dead while you become one with Christ. He's got one last hurrah aimed right at you. &gt;&gt; And somebody said, "Well, that'll put fear in your heart." It shouldn't. Didn't God bring you through the last time? Didn't he bring you through the last time? Didn't he bring you through the last time? &gt;&gt; Have you got any reason to believe he'll fail you in the last battle of it? &gt;&gt; No, sir. No, Siri. I want you to know he's abundantly able. &gt;&gt; Amen. Greater is he &gt;&gt; that is in you. &gt;&gt; Than he that's in that old element out there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter whether it's talking about the Kronos or whether it's talking about the system or whether it's talking about the It doesn't matter. Doesn't matter &gt;&gt; because there's a greater one. There's a creator. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Anybody here? &gt;&gt; There's a creator living on on the inside. &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 10. This settles it. This settles it. For for a believer, the day of atonement has come to a reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's not finished. &gt;&gt; It's something that we remember. It is an everlasting statute. &gt;&gt; It's something that every time we make this this cycle around the the Hebrew calendar, every year we come back to that and we rehearse it all over again. Why do you think God kept telling them in the older covenant and in the new covenant if you watch carefully that we should remember these things and memorialize these things and and become familiar with these things and remind oursel of these things because there's an enemy out there that wants you to have spiritual amnesia. &gt;&gt; There's a devil out there that wants you to forget what atonement is doing. Not just what it has done, &gt;&gt; but what it's doing. Somebody realize that the work of God in the last day has an ing on the end of it. &gt;&gt; I know there are many brethren out there who believe the period has come. I'm telling you, there's no period on who he is. &gt;&gt; There's an ing just keeps on. He's still purifying. He's still sanctifying. &gt;&gt; He's still washing by the water of the word. He's still covering unbelief with his precious blood. &gt;&gt; Watch this. Hebrews 10:19. Having therefore, brethren, &gt;&gt; boldness, I &gt;&gt; I only heard two or three of you. &gt;&gt; Let's do it again. Having therefore, brethren, &gt;&gt; boldness. Well, it's not in my nature to be bold. I'm more of a kitty cat, you know, instead of a lion. Well, I want you to know, like the songwriter said, you got a lion in you. &gt;&gt; You need to quit feeding the kitty cat. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Spiritually and maybe literally too. Those stinking things. &gt;&gt; Mobile homes and cats don't go along. &gt;&gt; They don't agree. &gt;&gt; Anybody with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. You don't want to keep feeding that kitty cat &gt;&gt; that's inside of you. You want to You want to feed the bigger one, &gt;&gt; the lion? Are you a believer? &gt;&gt; Are you washed in the blood? Sanctified by the wash of the water of the word. You filled with the Holy Ghost. Then you've got the lion of the tribe of Judah inside of you. A &gt;&gt; and you may not have heard this in a long time, but Revelation tells us that there is one who has prevailed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Weep no more, John. &gt;&gt; You've cried enough. &gt;&gt; John. John. You know, we sound like John. &gt;&gt; We sound like John sometime. We approach prayer like beggars. &gt;&gt; Let me preach just a little bit. &gt;&gt; Like whiny little beggars. Oh Lord, please. Hello. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Are you offending them? I I hope &gt;&gt; cuz sometimes the only way to get anybody to listen is to get them good and mad. &gt;&gt; Offend them and then let them listen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, I need you. We would just beg you, Lord, please. Do you think that's where we ought to be in this hour? &gt;&gt; I I mean, I know repentance is broken. We've got to be broken. We've got to be humble. I I get it. Don't you understand? 50 long years. I ought to have it. I ought to know some of that by now. Uh uh surely I understand the whole approaching humbly and so forth. But I also understand that the word has been revealed &gt;&gt; and it didn't come to make you smart. &gt;&gt; It came to give you a revelation &gt;&gt; that'll cause you to step on the devil instead of laying down and letting him walk all over you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Greater is he. &gt;&gt; Greater is he. &gt;&gt; Oh, you don't have to finish it. Just say, "Greater is he." &gt;&gt; Greater is he. &gt;&gt; And you got it. You got it. Having therefore, brethren, boldness. &gt;&gt; That's not disrespect. &gt;&gt; That's not God is not telling us to to be, you know, hotty. That's right. &gt;&gt; He's not telling us to walk where uh where with hobnailed shoes where angels fear to trod. &gt;&gt; Uh as God revealed to me some years ago long about 2007, uh I had an experience on September the 20th of that year, I had an experience in intercessory prayer where I I I saw Leviticus 16 unfolding before me. I saw the changing of the garment and the washing in the labor. I saw in the spirit the slaying of the bulock for the priest and his house. I I saw the goats. I saw the goats slayed. I saw for the Lord's goat. I saw uh as a uh that one that represents the wilderness and that one which represents darkness. I saw all that unfolding. Uh somewhere along the sequence of those events, I drew closer in the realm of the spirit and I was I I could have fallen off the balcony where I was sitting. I was wide awake. It was in the middle of the day. I could have fallen off the balcony because when I drew close, I saw my face and I said, "Lord, what in the world does this mean? You're the great high priest." A and why is it that in this experience I drew near and I saw myself. He said I'm going to reveal to you the priesthood of the believer. And in order to do that, I want to show you that there is a protocol that must be followed to enter into the holy. &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; You you can't just storm into the Holy of Holies &gt;&gt; with mud on your shoes. Amen. &gt;&gt; With dirt on your feet, &gt;&gt; with with dirt in your heart, &gt;&gt; with crud in your mind. &gt;&gt; Come on now. In fact, we understand about this day of atonement uh that somewhere along the way they started uh this tradition that they would keep the high priest up all night long. &gt;&gt; He didn't get any passes the next day. He had to work just as hard as he always had to work on the day of atonement. But he stayed up all night so that he wouldn't sleep. Why do you think they wouldn't let him sleep? Because he wouldn't be completely responsible for some kind of dream that he might would have in the night that would defile him. &gt;&gt; Did you know you dream something filthy? You need his sanctifying power &gt;&gt; to cleanse and cut that off of your life. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "What do I do?" You go to the word. &gt;&gt; How are we sanctified? By the word. &gt;&gt; How are we cleansed? By the word. Washing of the water of the word. Come on. That's how we do it. So, if you dream some filthy dream, if you people that have hung out for so long in pornography looking at those uh women with their with their big fat ruby red lips and and all that kind of garbage that this world likes to dangle in front of men because it knows that men receive their their their uh engine uh revs up visually. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; This is not normally how a woman is is revved up, but a man is revved up visually. So, the world has been slick and sly and it tries to put such garbage out there. We we you know, I said before, there used to be a day that you had to go in a sleazy place and buy the garbage, the smut, or you had to be bold enough to go into a 7-Eleven and ask for what was behind the the cover there. You know, they kept it. But no more the enemy. I remember how the old-timers preached against the television because they said, "You don't even have to go down to the movie hall, the movie house to see filth anymore. You that TV is going to bring it right into your They didn't know the fullness of what they were talking about. I sure did. &gt;&gt; They did not know the fullness of what they're talking about where we're living in such an hour that everything the world produces has to have at least one gay couple. &gt;&gt; Has to have at least one lesbian couple. Hello. &gt;&gt; It's got to have something like that just just so it can appeal to all audiences. I wonder what the old-timers would have thought looking ahead 40 years. I wonder what brother Brandon would have thought as I mentioned recently. So concerned about the pedal pushers that that I love uh Suzie wore, Lucy wore. So concerned about that. I wonder what he'd think about the hour we're living in today. And pornography has moved in the same direction that you no longer have to go find the fil. It'll come right on you. &gt;&gt; It'll come right to you &gt;&gt; and it will defile you. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you something. If it enters in the eye gate, it becomes a photograph. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; In the real estate of your brain, &gt;&gt; this is this is brain science. &gt;&gt; It's like taking a picture. &gt;&gt; Your brain takes a picture of that image. And the enemy knows at whatever time he wants to, he can pull that up out of the recesses and the dendrites of your brain and he can put that image right before you, take you right back to that place. &gt;&gt; And then you're going to walk in here on Sunday and play the piano. Or you're going to walk in here and lead the singing. Are you going to walk in here and play the drums? Are you going to walk in here and act like you've got the victory and you're just one big holy, you know, set free somebody uh without making any preparation to enter into the holy? It is not so. &gt;&gt; If you think it is, you fooled yourself. &gt;&gt; And if you think that nobody knows, you fooled yourself. &gt;&gt; The one who knows, the one who matters the most &gt;&gt; is the one who knows it all. There is a protocol. I'm preaching now. There is a protocol &gt;&gt; to enter into the holy. &gt;&gt; The saddest part of all of this is it's done. The price is paid. The blood is there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if we don't utilize and appropriate, if we don't take the power and authority of that blood and appropriate it in every area of our life, it's not his fault. It's not even the preacher's fault. &gt;&gt; Oh, I know how people love that. It's our own fault. &gt;&gt; It's It's available. &gt;&gt; I I wish somebody would try to come in here and tell me that the blood is no longer crying out on the mercy seat. I wish they would. &gt;&gt; I dealt with that thing 25 years ago, and I'm willing, willing, and ready to deal with that thing today. If the blood is still not crying out on your behalf, you're lost. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; You're in serious trouble. &gt;&gt; It's crying out. All you have to do is access it. All you have to do is appropriate it. What does that mean? It means use it. &gt;&gt; Apply it where it needs to be applied. Oh, I I see brother. Maybe he wasn't the greatest singer in all the world, but he had one song he could get out and get it out. Good. &gt;&gt; Rusty Goodman's song. Paint my mind &gt;&gt; with Calvar's blood. &gt;&gt; Paint my mind. Say it with me. Paint my mind. You've got to do that before you come into the presence of the Lord &gt;&gt; individually and most especially corporately. Because when you corporately gather with all that filth hanging on your life, &gt;&gt; you affect the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; We do. &gt;&gt; Your struggle becomes contagious. &gt;&gt; Your confusion becomes contagious. &gt;&gt; A confusing spirit starts operating among us. And we don't even know why we're confused. our thoughts become all boggled up and our and we can hardly, you know, even express ourselves in worship or in prayer or or or in leadership to know what even to do next. Folks, there's an answer for that. There's a remedy for that. You don't have to be that kind of a of an influence negatively on corporate gathering. &gt;&gt; You can follow the protocol &gt;&gt; to enter into the holy. That's why we need to remember the day of atonement. &gt;&gt; That's why we need to remember it every year &gt;&gt; because we need to remember the ways been made. The price has been paid. &gt;&gt; You don't have to come in like a coward. &gt;&gt; You can now come in boldly. &gt;&gt; If you're willing to follow the spiritual protocol, &gt;&gt; you stop at the labor. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And you don't worry about washing anybody else. You wash yourself first. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The labor, the holy labor, eventually it was lined with broken mirrors and it had a reflective a a reflective surface so that the priest is looking in. He sees a reflection, but it's a broken reflection because the mirror is pieces pieces of glass, pieces of reflective glass down in the water, but it's enough that he's able to see if he needs to scrub a a little dirt off of his forehead. This holy labor is part of the protocol of Leviticus 16 to enter into the holy. Don't look at me like you don't know what I'm talking about because most of you do. And I'd say even visitors have some kind of concept that this Old Testament is vitally important for us to get a foundation in what God taught us there to understand the privilege. The privilege of remembering these things when we need to remember them most. &gt;&gt; The blood has been offered. Somebody say once and for all. &gt;&gt; But you can't stomp around as brother Brandham said with hobnailed shoes. where angels fear to try. &gt;&gt; That was a part of the experience that I had way back then. I heard brother Brandham's voice in that experience. Didn't see him, but I heard his voice as clearly as I've ever heard it on tape in my life. And I've been listening to it a long time now. I think he's has a pretty recognizable and distinguished voice. Wouldn't you say? I heard that voice come ringing out over that experience. It was ringing out over the priest as he was going through as I was being prepared and going through these steps. And I heard him say, first of all, the voice uh said uh that there's a protocol to enter in the holy. And then I heard brother Brandham's voice come in. And his voice said, because fools will walk with hobnail shoes where angels fear to trod. Let me tell you something. And this security that we have as a believer is not the kind of security that fixes it so that we can come and worship God with dirty hands and a messed up mind and a perverted heart. That's not the kind of price that's been paid for us. The price that's been paid for us is it's available. It's free. It's done once and for all. All we have to do is take a moment of our life and go back and agree. &gt;&gt; Listen now. We just come back and agree with what he's already done. &gt;&gt; You you you mean it's as simple as saying, "Lord, forgive me and have mercy on me according to the word. It's that simple." But it's a powerful thing to be able to understand why it's that simple. &gt;&gt; Because what he does, let me tell you something. If you don't know this about him, what he does, he does well. &gt;&gt; He does right. the old system. It it took year after year after year after year. Uh it took multiplied millions of of animals slain. &gt;&gt; The blood could have filled up I don't know I don't know an ocean perhaps. It could have filled up a river perhaps. I don't know how much blood it would have been but it would have been a lot of blood. But here comes one &gt;&gt; walking right into the Holy of Holies. Not with borrowed blood, not with animal blood, but God's own blood. &gt;&gt; Blood that God created for the full redemption of mankind. He just walks in and just sprinkles it right there. &gt;&gt; Seven times, putting it right there where it belongs, on the mercy seat. You may believe that it's not crying out, but I hear it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hear it sometime. &gt;&gt; I hear it sometime. Just like Cain heard it, he heard blood talk. &gt;&gt; He heard the blood of the brother that he murdered talk. &gt;&gt; His blood crith out to me from the ground. Well, I want you to know the believers got a blood talking to him, talking to her, crying out to him, crying out to her. It's not the blood of Abel. &gt;&gt; Oh no, Sar. Even though Abel was a prophet, the Bible said, and his blood prophesied of another kind of blood, of another hour. But I want you to know and not the first Adam but rather the last Adam. &gt;&gt; The blood cries out. The blood of Jesus Christ. The blood that God created &gt;&gt; for the full deliverance of mankind. It cries out. &gt;&gt; Hear it. &gt;&gt; You can do it. Go forward. &gt;&gt; Take it. &gt;&gt; Possess it. &gt;&gt; Apply it. Appropriate it. Don't waste it. Don't devalue it. &gt;&gt; Get your help. Get your deliverance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't keep going in. The reality is many are not going in. Somebody said, "But I feel." It's not I feel. &gt;&gt; It's not I feel. Because you can be in that place and not feel a thing. It's not about what you feel. Thank God for feelings. I want you to know I appreciate feelings. I'm a feeler. I like feelings. I love to feel his presence. Sister Flo, I love to feel the shakana glory, the cavode of God. I love to know that we've touched a place in our worship that's brought him riding in here on wings. I I tell you, he he rushed in here. That presence of the Lord, that presence that goes before his face, it came rushing in here today, accomplishing more in just a few seconds of time that we can accomplish all day with our religious existences. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. I love that. But I want you to know it takes more than just a human reaction to his presence or what we would call a feeling. our goosebumps. &gt;&gt; Our hair stands up on our arms. That little tingle that sometimes I get on the back of my neck when his presence comes. Oh, I love that. I wouldn't trade that. I wouldn't trade that for the for a fifth of any any any beverage. &gt;&gt; I I wouldn't trade that for a hit on any kind of substance. I wouldn't trade that for for a dime bag or a hundred dime bags of grass or pot or marijuana or whatever you call it. &gt;&gt; There's nothing. There's nothing. There is no imitation. There is no counterfeit that even comes close &gt;&gt; to what it feels like when the presence of the Lord surges through you. Flesh, soul, and spirit. I tell you, it's life. &gt;&gt; It'll be like it'll you you it'll it'll make you feel like like the writers of the old I can run through a truth &gt;&gt; leap over a wall. &gt;&gt; But I'm not talking about a feeling. I'm talking about an assurance &gt;&gt; that my sin debt is paid &gt;&gt; and that all I have to do is come boldly into the presence of the Lord. Ask him to wash me again with the water of the word. Let me get ready to go in. I'm invited in. I'm called in. I'm not disqualified from coming in by anything that I've done. I'm only asked to follow a little protocol. &gt;&gt; Cleanse your thoughts. Father, would you have mercy on me? My I I woke up and I I realized that in the night a dream had come, a lustful thought had come, some old image had come to haunt me. I'm asking you to come today and cleanse me by the washing of the water of the word. May I never act upon that kind of a thing again. May my deliverance be so powerful, so overwhelming, so perfect &gt;&gt; that I never find myself falling back into that again. &gt;&gt; You don't draw back and say, "I I can't go in. I can't go in. I'm not worthy to go in." No. You just make a little protocol. You just wash a little bit in the labor. Yeah. &gt;&gt; As a minister, as someone who leads, as someone who plays a role, let me tell you something. When you stand on this rostrm, do you know what the rostroom is? I just felt old. Rostrm. I remember the old-timers, too. You know, I cover my jowls up, but the old-timers, you know, they had them them hanging down, you know, the skin give way and it just started hanging down under their neck and their cheeks got really jiggly and they would preach on sin and they'd say debauchery and people's eyes would get big and the kids were terrified and nobody knew what debauchery was. I hope you know what a rostroom is. when you prop yourself up here, when you walk up on this plate, we we don't have a temple. &gt;&gt; We don't have a tabernacle. &gt;&gt; We We don't have a building that we say God dwells there and we have to go there to visit him. &gt;&gt; We bring him. &gt;&gt; We bring him with us when we come. &gt;&gt; Now, that doesn't mean there's not a residual. I spend a lot of time in this place by myself, doors locked, and I can tell you right now, doesn't matter whether it's 10:00 in the morning or 9:00 at night, there is a residual. &gt;&gt; I feel it many times. Many times I walk through here to the to the printer or I walk through here to the file room or I have spiles uh there in the front. I just walk through here and his presence comes. I feel him. I'm thankful to feel him. But the reality is he doesn't dwell. He doesn't He doesn't live forever in a building made with men's hands. He's looking for a body of flesh. He's always wanted to live in a body of flesh. He did in Christ. He does in his bride. You need to remember that. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He lives in you. &gt;&gt; We bring his presence here. But if we were going to set something apart, if we were going to take a a sanctuary as a we build them today and we were going to say, I mean, it's holy everywhere. &gt;&gt; Uh it's holy at the back door. &gt;&gt; It's holy at the front door. &gt;&gt; This place is dedicated. It's not your place to eat. &gt;&gt; It's not your place to play games on your phone. &gt;&gt; And it's not your place to sleep. got a bed to do that in. &gt;&gt; Some of you need a new pillow. Some of you need an old mammy to tell you to go to bed. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; We we we're grown and and like children. We need an old mammy to tell us go to bed. You're going to the house of God tomorrow and you ought to be your best when you get there. &gt;&gt; That's right. But if we were going to say, brother Brandham said, this this desk here, he said these things, describing this as a holy place, &gt;&gt; he said, no man has any right to stand behind this desk &gt;&gt; unless he has had a taste &gt;&gt; of the original mana. &gt;&gt; I'm far from an angel. I want you to understand. But he described as the scripture does the the man who stands here with the word of the Lord on your behalf is an angel to the church. &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean with with wings and halos, &gt;&gt; play harps, and I certainly don't wear diapers yet. &gt;&gt; It means a messenger. &gt;&gt; And it means a messenger to your heart. And we not only need a messenger to our heart, but but we need we need one more often than we realize sometimes. &gt;&gt; Yes, he talks to us as individuals. Yes, he talks to us from his word. But God said the bride will never come. She will not be able to come to a place where she can be in unity of faith &gt;&gt; without a five-fold ministry. &gt;&gt; Each person filling the role that God has given them to fill. building building building building a corporate body of Christ. But this this is this is sort of a this is sort of a a place of reverence and it's sort of a place that's set aside as a holy place. And and I would to God that you would think about how you how you walk up here and how you walk down from here. But I would also wish that you would think about how you come in those glass doors out there &gt;&gt; because as I said, I I I don't have a real revelation of a concept that says this is more holy. You know, the left side's more holy than the right side. No, no, it's not about that at all. &gt;&gt; It's about why we're here. &gt;&gt; And I can understand I can understand if you had to throw yourself at the altar every time you fall and fail and beg God to save you. I can understand why you'd get tired and just wouldn't have have the strength and to make the effort sometime. But that's not what he requires. &gt;&gt; If you've done that, if you've made your peace with him and the blood has washed your life, &gt;&gt; it's done. It's finished for what the blood of lambs and bulls could not accomplish under the opaces of the instruction and the law. He came a blood sacrifice. He came a spotless lamb. &gt;&gt; And he said, "It is finished." &gt;&gt; So, it's not that you have to come and beg your way back to God. You just have to come and follow a little protocol. &gt;&gt; And we ought to remember that. Not just on the day of atonement, but there's just a little protocol. You wash your hands, don't you? I was running late this morning, not because I wasn't up. I got up at 5:55 this morning. Went in and got my shower. prayed in the shower. Uh I was awake at 4. So somewhere between 4:30 or 4:45 and 5:55 I must have dozed back off to sleep because it was at 4:00 that I felt a breakthrough for those little twins, particularly for Isaac. But I dozed back off and I really didn't want to get up at 5:55. But I had my alarm set for 6:30 and I didn't want it to go off if I could possibly help it. And and I said, "Lord," when I dozed back off, I remember praying now, "Lord, don't let me oversleep. Let me let me get up. I want to finish doing some things." And at 5:55, it was like somebody opened my eyelids for me. I boy. And I reached over and got 5:55. But I was still running a little bit late getting here this morning because I was still putting something together. And as we walked out the door, Mama Dear was in the yard. Joshua had already gone out with the case and mama dear was in the yard and she was hungry. And when I mean in the yard, I mean in the yard. She was standing between right in front of my vehicle and uh I saw a few little kernels of corn from the last time down in the down in the um and Jacob, you're not invited to come to my house to visit me for for any cause or reason because my dear tame and you touch them and we're going to put you on the wall. I'll tell you that because Joshua threatens all the time. It wouldn't take much of a sportsman. That's about the kind of sportsman I am. I'd have to do it like that if I ever did. And I don't have any intention of doing that. I don't have to. As long as you share with me, I don't need to do it. But anyway, I'm down there trying to dig a kernel of corn out of the out of the uh the railroad tie there to get because she's hungry. I could tell she's hungry. She wasn't going nowhere. Mariah went back in the house. She was going with she got corn and brought it out and and put it there. And she is nuzzling us until until we feed her. And uh so by the time I got here, uh I was already a little bit flustered and I knew that there was much that had to be done. But I always take a moment in my heart, in my mind, in my thoughts. I always take a moment before I come through that door or before I come through that door and I say in my heart, Lord, thank you for this place. You've given us a beautiful place to come and worship you. We can we can cool it in the summer and heat it in the winter. And I don't want to take it for granted. And Lord, if there's anything in my heart, in my mind, in my life that that would prevent me from entering in to the to the holiness of God, would you help me now? Would you show it to me? Would you cleanse me? Would you you you don't mean to tell me, "Oh, yes. I've sat in the vehicle on a Monday morning and prayed until I knew my heart was right, my attitude was right." Not because I think this is a holy building in the sense that he didn't ride over with me. He rode over with me. &gt;&gt; But we should somehow keep some kind of differentiation, some kind of imaginary line between the world out there and this atmosphere in here. &gt;&gt; And I'll just be honest with you. I don't want you living on this property. I don't even want you visiting on this property. If you can't somehow keep in your mind and in your heart going forward that this is a place that God has set aside &gt;&gt; for us &gt;&gt; and for others who have yet to come &gt;&gt; to manifest his glory. as brother Greley and I are standing in the room there and we're planning we're planning uh just talk just we we just started sharing in the few minutes that we had uh of our ideas for the future and what we believe God is doing. I believe with all my heart that we're reaching a place where we're going to outgrow some things &gt;&gt; and we have to be willing. We have to be willing to be fluid. We have to be willing to be bendable. We have to be willing. We But we have to be willing to honor &gt;&gt; and respect what God has already given. &gt;&gt; If I can't trust you to be stewards over what I've provided, it's almost like I can hear him say sometime, "If I can't trust you to steward what I've already done, what makes you think &gt;&gt; that I would want to keep giving?" &gt;&gt; That's right. Wow. &gt;&gt; So somehow on this day of atonement as we enter into this season, we're we're not lost and undone without God and we're begging for a blood sacrifice. It's done. &gt;&gt; But I will tell you that that doesn't mean we don't need the blood. &gt;&gt; We still need the power of the blood. We still need to appropriate the deliverance &gt;&gt; that the blood has afforded and made possible in our lives. And that's why I saw the saints one time underneath a fresh blood bath in the spirit as ever climbing Mount Zion. And I I I hesitated to tell it because brother Brandon makes this statement about not seeing blood in the vision. Well, I don't know. I can't answer to it. First of all, I can't find that in the scripture. Second of all, I can't answer it. I don't know why it came that way. All I have to do is say I have to tell you how it came. But I saw this. It wasn't gory. wasn't gross. &gt;&gt; It didn't make me queasy. &gt;&gt; It lifted me. &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; that there was such an hour that defeat had prevailed &gt;&gt; and sin had ruled &gt;&gt; and laziness had overtaken &gt;&gt; secrecy. Secrecy. &gt;&gt; Digging ditches to try to cover up. Not literally skeletons, but spiritually. And for me to think that God would pass by and say, "I want to douse you &gt;&gt; one more time in the lifegiving, penetrating, delivering blood of the lamb." &gt;&gt; And I saw it. And I tell you what, I need it. I need it. I always need it. We get dirty by the residual of contact. &gt;&gt; We go in filthy places, which I don't mean honky tons and juke joints. I don't I don't find myself there very often. &gt;&gt; But even Walmart, &gt;&gt; the restaurant, &gt;&gt; there's so much filth around us. &gt;&gt; And just the very presence of God that's with us stirs up the enemy everywhere we go. &gt;&gt; Come on. And we need to go with light and we need to go with love and we need to go with hope and we need to go with power. &gt;&gt; And I want somebody to come and say, "I don't know who you are." &gt;&gt; But I know I felt something change when you walked in the room. &gt;&gt; Can you tell me who you are? &gt;&gt; Can you tell me who you're related to? Can you tell me why you feel so familiar to me? And as far as I know, I've never seen you before. How many of you want that kind of an opportunity? &gt;&gt; Do you? Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Then you're going to have to prepare yourself. &gt;&gt; There's a protocol for entering into the holy. &gt;&gt; Anybody with me? &gt;&gt; Thank God I got some time. Now, let's go quickly to the basis of fellowship 1961. And while you're getting ready, while they're finding that, well, that was very quick. Thank you. Before I could even get there, we talked last week about Yamuro, which is the which is the feast of trumpets in the Bible. And there are three great trumps to Israel mentioned all through the scripture old and new testament. One is the trumpet that sound on Mount Si to announce that God's instruction had come down to Moses. Powerful. It represented the voice of God. &gt;&gt; The people the people if you if you go through some of that they said now second time around Moses you you go up and let him talk to you. You come down. Tell us &gt;&gt; the the voice the sound of the voice of God from the top of Mount Si struck such a fear and an awe and a reverence in their heart &gt;&gt; that they said let the prophet go up and hear him. &gt;&gt; We just soon hear the prophet. &gt;&gt; You understand the concept? &gt;&gt; The voice of God seemed so large, so loud, so holy, so powerful. They were afraid that the ve voice, the very voice itself would consume them in their rebellion. And then the and then the next trump that's called the first trump. And then the next trump is the one that we talked about last week, feast of trumpets. And that's the one that's going to sound at rapture time. &gt;&gt; We know that because the prophet verifies for us that even though the rapture is a process, there will be a blast. &gt;&gt; And that blast will wake up the dead. &gt;&gt; The blast will be a voice and we don't have to go back to that because we understand it. Then the last trump is the great trump. And it's the one that calls an end to the day of atonement. The day has passed. The work is done. The price is paid. And for another year, Israel believes that she has received a covering, a seal. You and I know something more than that. &gt;&gt; We know that there's no expiration. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's no expiration on what he's done for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't have to do the same thing next year at this time. &gt;&gt; You can fellowship what he's already done for you anytime you want to. &gt;&gt; But you've got to do it with a protocol and with faith. &gt;&gt; Faith. Faith makes the difference. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; So the great trump is the one blown on Yamapour or the day of to of atonement. And we know that that will come. That will be the blast that sounds according to Zachchariah's prophecy at the second coming. And it will speak of the of the redemption of national Israel. &gt;&gt; It will be the second coming where where we could really call it the third coming because he comes the first time to redeem his bride. He comes the second time to catch away his bride. He comes the next time at the end of the great tribulation with &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; with his bride. &gt;&gt; Revelation 19 tells us he rides on a white horse. He that is faithful and true. and the armies of heaven come with him. You don't really believe that, do you? Aren't you pretty sure that's all symbolic? &gt;&gt; Oh, just go ahead and think that. I can't hardly wait to see you ride one right down through eternity &gt;&gt; so I can wave over at your horses. &gt;&gt; It's real. &gt;&gt; It's not all a symbol. many, many, many, many symbols, &gt;&gt; but it's not all a symbol. &gt;&gt; They're coming, the armies of heaven coming with him on white horses to execute the final judgment of God on this earth to call national Israel to her day of salvation. Zechariah tells us that those Jews who see him there, what are these scars in your hand? This time in the rapture, he doesn't put his foot on the ground. In the rapture, he doesn't touch down. In the rapture, he appears in the air. But in the second coming, his foot touches the top of the Mount of Olives. An earthquake happens and the and the mountain opens up. The Bible tells us that splits right down the middle. It opens up and the Jews standing there. Well, I'll tell you, there are plenty of Jews there. &gt;&gt; In fact, thousands of them are buried right there, &gt;&gt; right on the Mount of Olives. &gt;&gt; There's so many buried there. And they've been buried there so long that some of their crypts have slid off into the valley. And it's a premium piece of real estate. Cost a lot of money to have your dead bones buried there. Why do you think that would be so important? Because they believe Judaism believes that when the Messiah comes that he's coming to the Mount of Olives. &gt;&gt; God is so sneaky. Jehovah Gyra. Jehovah Shalom. &gt;&gt; Jehovah sneaky. He sets it up. They know exactly where he's going to appear. &gt;&gt; No missing him this time. &gt;&gt; He comes in the clouds of glory. &gt;&gt; And just as soon as the Jewish people can get over the fact that there's Gentiles on them horses, too. &gt;&gt; They'll look and see his hands &gt;&gt; and they'll say, "What are these scars? Oh my god, this breaks me. It It both thrills me and cracks me open at the same time. What are these scars? He'll say, "Oh, this is that that I received in the household of my friends." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And their eyes open. Scripture says, "So the veil is removed." &gt;&gt; So you know that third trumpet, that that great trump, that yamapour trump, that day of atonement trump, it's the one that opens the eyes. It's the one that removes the veil. &gt;&gt; It's the ones that they look and see. Oh no. Oh no. This is the one that our fathers murdered. This is the one that our fathers murdered. This is the one our fathers rejected. Oh, have mercy on us. Oh, have mercy on us. This is the one. His blood is upon the generations because they rejected him. But he has come one more time and made himself known to us. &gt;&gt; And scripture says all Israel will be saved. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Because they could have received him the first time had God at his mercy not blinded their eyes. According to the Apostle Paul in the book of Romans, blinded their eyes that they couldn't see exactly who he was in the beginning &gt;&gt; so that you and I could have an opportunity. &gt;&gt; Isn't God good? Isn't God good? &gt;&gt; I I'm I'm on it. I'm on a roll here. I got to stop now. But uh uh just one o'clock. I I hope uh I hope that you know that we we we don't we don't go home at one. Now then once a year the high priest oh my had to be dressed in a certain way. He he had to be anointed a certain way. He had to be anointed with the perfume of the rose of Sharon. They put it upon Aaron's beard. And remember it wasn't just rose of Sharon. All those beautiful ingredients that made up that holy anointing oil. They put it on on Aaron's beard and it run. They parted on his head, if we were looking right at the scripture, and it ran down his beard &gt;&gt; and it ran all the way down, the scripture said, to the hem of his garment &gt;&gt; and and just slipped off of his feet. Come on. I'm telling you, that's a lot of oil, isn't it? &gt;&gt; They put it way down to the hems of his garment. He had to have a certain made clothes, everything. The ephod had to be made just right. The breastplate had to be made just right. The miter had to be made just right. Come on. behind the breastplate, the pocket for the Urim and Thimim, it had to be just right. &gt;&gt; Everything about him. And brother, if you go through Leviticus 16, this man, this poor man, he scrubbed his body. He he bathed himself so many times on on the day of atonement and changed clothes so many times on the day of atonement. Nobody was taking a chance. Right. &gt;&gt; What I love is that the high priest wore the royal robes of his priesthood every day of the year. But on the day of atonement, he didn't wear them all day. Because when he entered into that holy place with the blood of the bulock and the blood of the Lord's goat, he had to take off the holy, the beautiful, the royal, everything that was so fancy and woven and and royal and and priestly looking. And he went in with just a simple ephod like a little garment without a hymn like your Lord would have wore. We know that when the scripture says they touch the hem of his garment, they didn't touch the hymn because they didn't hem the ends of their garments in those days, not the simple and common men. They just cut them. They just cut them out of cloth, cut a hole, put them on, cinched them with a sash. But what that was was it was the it was the zit seat that hung down from his from his uh talit. And someone said I I I I I understand the prophet said that that Jesus was not a Jew folks. He worshiped as a Jew. &gt;&gt; He was born and raised in a Jewish home &gt;&gt; and he worshiped as a Jew. You can't say anything other than that. He didn't have the blood of a Jew in him. because he didn't carry Joseph's blood. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; But he worshiped as one. &gt;&gt; And so when that little woman with the issue of blood, she grabbed a hold of the holy and sacred name of God. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; The knots and the threads and the twist and she put her hand on that and the virtue that was in him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Not in the zit. But the virtue that was in him went out of him &gt;&gt; because she grabbed a hold of the holy name of God. And you know when she did that, she was acknowledging that his name is above my disease. His name is above my marriage problems. His name is above my addictions. His name is above come on. &gt;&gt; I'm down here on my face reaching up to grab a sacred thing. &gt;&gt; But even that wasn't enough. It was the virtue that was in him that reached out and touched him. And so when that high priest would go in behind that veil, he had to go in with a very simple garment. Just a humble little garment. When he offered that blood, he couldn't go in there looking like he was the king of priests. &gt;&gt; He had to go in there looking simple and humble. He had to be simple. He had to be humble because the lamb was because the lamb was. Oh, folks. like a lamb, like a sheep led to the slaughter, and yet he uttered not a sound, meek and mild. That's the That's the Jesus the church is going to be looking for. And that Jesus isn't making another appearance. &gt;&gt; He's not coming the next time as a meek and a lowly little lamb. &gt;&gt; He's not coming the next time as a little humble baby in a manger. The next time he comes, he's coming as a lion of the tribe of Judah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's coming to put an end. &gt;&gt; He'll stop the war of He'll stop the battle of Armageddon and all the evil and dark forces fighting that which is righteous, holy, and light. He'll put an end to all of that. &gt;&gt; I want to be so I want to be so carnal in this moment that I would say he's going to come to to do some kicking and some name taking, but I won't be that carnal. He's coming to do away with that thing that has has plagued the earth, the darkness. &gt;&gt; The Essenes saw it. The Essenes uh camped down there. John the Baptist among them and camped down there looking over from Kuman looking over the Dead Sea studying studying the scrolls, studying the end of days. And they looked there and they saw this great battle between darkness and light. And they described it to the best of their ability. And one day it'll be a physical reality. Oh my. And when it does, he's comes to put an end to it. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that the the death of that battle will be so great that the blood will run to the horse's bridal. And the terror of those days just before Messiah comes, just before he brings his redeemed bride back with him, just before the terror of those days, those last three and a half years of great tribulation, the time of Jacob's sorrow, will be so bad that men will run to the mountains and cry to the rocks, &gt;&gt; fall on us, and hide us from the face of the wrath of great God. Let me tell you something. &gt;&gt; The Bible said they'll seek death. I wasn't even a teenager when the Lord took me in the spirit by vision and showed me a glimpse of the end days. And I saw in before my eyes, I saw a man with what looked like a big machete. And he took that trying to cut off his own head. It was so razor sharp that it was enough to probably do the job had he had the force. But I watched it like in slow motion. I don't want to scare anybody. I don't plan to be around. But I saw it as he went through with with quite a bit of force. I could see as he as he initiated, but it was almost like slow motion. And I saw as it passed through, just one little trickle of blood, just one little trickle of blood came out this side as I watched that that sharp swordlike machete pass all the way through. And I saw his struggle to get it right through the bone and come out the other side. And when he did, it was already healed. He was seeking death. I didn't understand. Didn't even know the scripture said such a thing when I saw it. But the Bible said that they will seek death and death will flee from them. &gt;&gt; They're looking for a way out because they rejected the way out. &gt;&gt; It's a serious hour. &gt;&gt; You don't have to make reservations for that event. God's calling you to something higher than that. &gt;&gt; I feel some of you. &gt;&gt; I feel some of you. He goes on, they put in Aaron's beard. Had to have a certain made clothing and on the end of his garment had a bail and a pomegranate. Bail and a pomegranate. He had to walk a certain way to make that thing holy, holy, holy unto the Lord. The bell would ring, tingling, tingling, tingling, dingling. And every time it rang, the sound that it made was saying, "Holy, holy, holy unto the Lord." Do you think that God is going to require the high priest of a of of a of a inferior covenant? &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; to enter into the presence without holiness. I if if if he required holiness under that inferior covenant, &gt;&gt; what kind of a sound do you think this little bride is going to have to be releasing when she steps into the fullness of the kingdom of a higher superior way? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She's going to have to release and say, "Holy, holy, holy, holy unto the Lord. Holy unto the Lord. Holy unto the Lord. Holy unto the Lord." You sisters are going to have to cover up. Holy, holy, holy, holy unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; You brothers are going to have to consider your thought process getting over here. Holy, holy, holy unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's got to be your song. &gt;&gt; The reality is we could do everything just right and not be holy enough, but we're wearing his holiness. Amen. &gt;&gt; But our unrighteousness, our slack, loose living &gt;&gt; is like watering down &gt;&gt; and trampling again under our feet the precious blood &gt;&gt; of the sacrifice &gt;&gt; when we refuse to make a little protocol. Father, sanctify my thoughts. &gt;&gt; Help me look above the humanity of my brother. Help me look above the humanity of my sister and let me see them as the holy and the chosen and the royal and the redeemed seed of the Lord. Those who carry the very monogene of the DNA of Almighty God. &gt;&gt; That's pretty powerful stuff. &gt;&gt; You are carrying the seed, not a seed. You are carrying the seed. Yes, the Greek word is sperma, but the context is not what a man can produce. &gt;&gt; It's only what almighty God can produce. &gt;&gt; And you're carrying the gene seat of God as one called to walk out this life of purity in the bride. Everything you need to overcome. We make it look weak. We make it look like a salesman pitch &gt;&gt; when we refuse to utilize &gt;&gt; what God has provided for us. &gt;&gt; I don't think you heard me. &gt;&gt; When we continue to bicker among ourselves, &gt;&gt; making up I tell you what what disturbs me more than anything else in this hour is the lack of integrity among people. &gt;&gt; Make up stories. They don't have to have gossip. They don't have to have somebody tell them a story and they're going to repeat it. No, no, no, no. If there's not enough juice, not enough tea, they call it not enough what what else do they call it? God. Well, that's just kind of wore out, you know, but that that's right. It is. If there's not enough of that, if there's not enough of that, they'll just make something up. &gt;&gt; They'll just embellish a situation. They they they'll just do anything and say anything to try to uh water down someone's influence, &gt;&gt; causing others to cast away confidence in somebody. Folks, let me tell you something. When you live that kind of a life and claim to be a part of this bride and part of this truth and this message and you live that kind of life on a consistent basis, dressing up your stories, changing details to make you look better and everybody else look rotten. It's lowering the standard and it's causing others to look and see. They don't have any victory. They they can't even overcome their own thoughts. I'm telling you, there's a bride coming out of this process. &gt;&gt; You don't want to stand in her way. &gt;&gt; You don't want to get in her way. I'm going to close in a little bit soon. Not too long. Holy, holy, holy. What's he doing? He's approaching the shikan the shakana glory. The shikina glory. The real fellowship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, you see, he had to make a noise. The only way the congregation could tell he wasn't dead, one day a year, day of atonement, the day we're talking about, &gt;&gt; 10th day of tisher on the on the Hebrew calendar, the only way they could tell he wasn't dead is they'd hear that noise. I tell you when church lets off its noise &gt;&gt; there's something happens &gt;&gt; he said right assures the world because everywhere the shakana glory is &gt;&gt; there is noise &gt;&gt; Jesus had the noisiest revival meeting that anybody ever had in the history of mankind &gt;&gt; because wherever he went noise followed &gt;&gt; wherever that glory is sir &gt;&gt; well I'm an introvert hurt. You know, that makes me disgusted &gt;&gt; to hear people say such a foolish thing. &gt;&gt; Really, that is so foolish. &gt;&gt; If you to spend as much time reading the Bible as you did trying to learn that you was an introvert, &gt;&gt; did you know what the word said? &gt;&gt; Old things And &gt;&gt; let me just go ahead and tell you this. Don't make an enemy of one. Don't make an enemy of an introvert because if you do, you'll know there's no such thing. They hide behind a title that someone passed to them from a book they read &gt;&gt; and they use it as an excuse because they said, you know, I'm an introvert. I don't like controversy. I don't like what what you mean to say is you don't really have a backbone &gt;&gt; unless you're doing it under the covers. &gt;&gt; All things are passed away. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Anybody awake? &gt;&gt; Behold, all &gt;&gt; I'm green. I'm red. I'm purple. I'm yellow. I'm an introvert. I'm an extrovert. I'm an in between. It sounds to me like what the world says. I'm binary. &gt;&gt; I'm gender undefinable. What? &gt;&gt; Take a look and you'll see. &gt;&gt; You may have forgotten, but God didn't forget. &gt;&gt; He knows how he made you. &gt;&gt; Don't you let anybody's psychology define you. Don't you let anybody's label define you. Don't you let somebody's book define you. Old things have passed away. Behold, all things have become new. You're not an introvert. You're not upside down or all around or any other kind of thing if you're in him. You're a new creature. &gt;&gt; And you can be everything God said you were to be &gt;&gt; if you'll yield. &gt;&gt; If you'll yield. &gt;&gt; Oh, said, "Watch that man that's anointed." Aaron went in packing the blood before him. Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy unto the Lord. Them bells chiming out, anointed going into the holy. How the congregation used to admire that man. How he went in there one day and left his old staff that he had in his hand. And when he went back again, the staff that was dead, nothing but an old stick. It had come to life, bloomed and had blossoms on it. Listen, it was budding almonds &gt;&gt; laying in the presence of If If If that Old Branch can come alive, blossom, bloom, and bear almonds &gt;&gt; in the presence of the Lord, what do you think an old an old sailor like you some old citizen like you? What do you think God could do out of you &gt;&gt; if you just lay a little while? Not in a feeling, &gt;&gt; in a presence. &gt;&gt; I'm moving ahead and I'll uh close in a bit, but uh maybe speak a little more on it uh Tuesday night. But I marvel at the process that he had to go through all of the steps. And I want to give you just a few of them to keep in your mind. Leviticus chapter 16 verse 4. The first step of preparing the high priest for the day of atonement was to wash in the holy labor. We've talked about it, but let me give it to you in the scripture. Write it down maybe. Uh Leviticus 16:4. He shall put on the holy linen coat which is the ifad and he shall have the linen breaches upon his flesh and shall be girded with a linen girdle. Now you can say anything you want to but God required those linen breaches under his tunic as if odd. The scripture said so because in that tabernacle that that altar that was out in the in the in the congregation out there in that outer court, that altar was high and it had a ramp going up to it. And the scripture said those breaches were there to cover the nakedness of his thigh. Now, if God is concerned about a man's thigh going up to offer sacrifices, and then don't tell me today that he doesn't care how naked and stripped off people get out in the world. &gt;&gt; That thigh, this is not a woman, this is a man. He's doing holy business. And men and women who are on holy business, &gt;&gt; they're not to be exposing their thigh, &gt;&gt; whether it's in a tight pair of britches. &gt;&gt; You ain't all skinny. &gt;&gt; You need to buy you some beefy jeans. or whether it is some stripped off way. There's a protocol for entering into the holy. &gt;&gt; 50 years I've preached it. I don't think I'll stop now. &gt;&gt; He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breaches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with a linen maider shall he be attired. These are the holy garments. Therefore shall he wash his flesh in water. and so put them on. This is the requirement in the outer court. He has to wash himself first. Then he puts on linen garments, special garments. We just read simple garments. And when we read that, I tell you, every time when I read that, I think of Philippians 2:7 where the Bible said, "But made himself of," this is Jesus, "made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men." Here he is down on his knees washing the dirty feet of those who are called to serve his purpose. That's right. &gt;&gt; Master washing servant. Servant washing master. Because the reality is flesh is flesh. Flesh is flesh. There's a protocol. And then we hear in in this maybe this be it. Revelation chapter 4. This is not the scripture. This is a quotation. Let me get it here now. Paragraph 218. Notice as they entered in musicians, I know. Come on. Would you come? Musicians. Now, notice as they entered in, the congregation could come there. The priest could stand here, but the high priest could go in there. Holy of holies once a year taking the blood with him. He had to be dressed a certain way, a certain garment. Had to have a bell and a pomegranate one to another, one to one another. And when he walked, he had to walk a certain way. And it played holy, holy unto the Lord just like he said in the other. He was approaching God and he was having the blood of the covenant in his hand. He has killed a bulock. He has sanctified first his own family, himself, his own family. Now he goes in behind that veil and he offers that blood first on the altar. Then he goes and gets the blood of the Lord's goat that's been killed. And he brings that blood in. He does the same way. He sprinkles it the same way on the altar. And then he sanctifies the entirety of the sanctuary with that blood. It's a process. Brother Brandham understood that there was a process involved here. He has in his hands the blood. Listen, before he can do that, before he can even go in with the blood, he's got to fill up the space with a cloud of incense. &gt;&gt; Because redemption has to have an atmosphere. Deliverance has an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; He's clean. He's been up all night. He's washed his clothes. He's got blood in his hand. And still, it was a requirement that he take cos of fire off the altar, place them in the holy sensor, and place some of that holy resin on that sensor. and it begins to let off that incense. Oh my, what a wonderful amazing aroma. And it produces a cloud so that when he goes in, he goes in an atmosphere. And and we know we know that that incense represents both the prayers and the praise of the saints. That kind of a prayer and a praise creates an atmosphere for the glory of God to come down on that mercy seat between those cherry beams and receive that blood that is sprinkled. I'm telling you, you it's part of the protocol. &gt;&gt; You don't just stomp into the presence of the Lord. You go in with praise. &gt;&gt; You got to get down. &gt;&gt; There was no split in the veil, &gt;&gt; right? It wasn't a gate. It wasn't a door. It was a veil. Now, there is extra biblical writings of of Jew of Jewish sages who say that there was a period of time that the high priest stood on one side of that veil and the next thing they knew he was on the other side. And they have no explanation for how he got through. Somebody said, liberable. You don't know if you can believe such a thing as that or not? Do you believe it when the Bible said that Jesus walked through the wall? &gt;&gt; Do you believe that in his resurrected body when he appeared to the apostles, he didn't use a door? &gt;&gt; He just appeared among them. &gt;&gt; He just showed up in the room. &gt;&gt; If God can do that, do you really have a problem believing that the that God could take a high priest on one side of the veil and put him on the other side? Please folks, don't become skeptics in this last hour. &gt;&gt; If there's ever been an hour to embrace the supernatural workings of a supernatural God because you're a supernatural people, &gt;&gt; this is the hour to do that. &gt;&gt; And if you're sitting under something that won't allow you to embrace that, you're sitting under the wrong thing. &gt;&gt; He's a supernatural God. He said, "I'm going to have a supernatural people &gt;&gt; and I'm going to deal with them in a supernatural way." Wise. &gt;&gt; Then how'd he get in the rest of the time? Under. Under. This is the high priest only one at a time. &gt;&gt; And how did he get into the holy of holies? He's got a sensor in one hand. A &gt;&gt; and a bowl of blood in the other hand. I don't know if he had to get down on his knees and put one put one down while he while he got his arm up under the veil. I'm not sure if he held one in one hand, one other, and used his nose like a porpus to lift that veil up, &gt;&gt; but I know he was stripped of his royal. He didn't even have the golden miter on his head. He just had a linen miter which was like a sweat rag tied around the top of his head, but it still said holiness unto the Lord, but it didn't have the gold. Didn't have the crown that went with it. So, he's got a what looks like a sweat rag on his head and a very simple servant's garment. He's got incense. He got blood. I don't know how he's doing all these different things. We don't we don't know. We weren't there. But I know this. He had to get his low Somebody said, "Don't you expect the priest? Don't you expect the priest helped him get in?" I tell you what, they were probably afraid &gt;&gt; to look into the holiness that was behind that veil, knowing that only one was ordained to go in. &gt;&gt; So, the point is this. If you want to go up, you got to go down first. Yes. &gt;&gt; The way up is not up. The way up is down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You heard brother Brandham talk about it, didn't you? &gt;&gt; In the priest of way the man walked up. Oh, hearty, you know, come down a little different. If he'd have went up like he come down that high priest, he had to get pretty low right down on the dirt. Someone told me this week I had to humble myself and be on my face before the Lord. That won't hurt any of us. &gt;&gt; I didn't hear you. &gt;&gt; Get a low. Get as low as you can. He'll lift you. He'll lift you. He won't leave you there. He won't leave you there. &gt;&gt; He'll raise you up. He is the glory and the lifter of my hands. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you exalt yourself, you'll find yourself on the bottom. That's right. &gt;&gt; But if he exalts you, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If he raises you up, &gt;&gt; if he lifts you up, that's what he was doing today. &gt;&gt; And the spirit of the Lord fell there. Jacob, different ones. That's him. He's coming to say, "I want I don't want you down there all along. I don't want you to stay down there. I want to lift you up. I want to give you a little hope. God, we got to go." He said, he said he went in 220 anointed with certain perfumes. His clothes made holy ghost fil registered hands made his clothes rose of sharon anointing all poured on his head ran all down his beard down over his place royal perfume of pomegranate the bail taking the blood of an innocent lamb and he dared to approach that veil outside he'd die right there where he was standing. So he had to go walk in a certain way. Holy, holy, holy unto the Lord. I tell you, we we don't have to we don't have to speculate. It was a trembling. It wasn't some performance. It wasn't some waltz. It wasn't some three steps forward and two steps back. He was the very essence of who he was was responding to the divine presence of almighty God behind that veil. And when his body began to tremble first from the inside out, those bells begin to jingle. And when those bells began to cry, holy, holy, holy unto the Lord, it wasn't him. It was something else. It was his reverence. It was his It was his dedication to humility, encountering the living God. It's powerful. He'd die right there. He said, "Taking the blood of innocent lamb, he dared to approach that veil outside. He'd die right there where he was standing." So he had to go walk in a certain way approaching God. And he went there and offered the blood on the mercy seat once a year. Say it. Once a year. And while he was in there, he's privileged to see the sheck glory. When the pillar of fire, the amber light that came down, greenish yellow, amber light, not reddish orange. It's not fire, it's amber. Led the children of Israel out of Israel. He even smoked up the temple so no one could see. The glory of the Lord fell till it was all smoked up. He came in himself, went in behind the veil, settled down on the mercy seat in the holiest of holies. Didn't he say, didn't God say, didn't God Almighty say, "I'll meet you in there &gt;&gt; between the wings of a cherry beam." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm closing. Oh, how the congregation must have envied him. It was really nothing to envy. It ought moments. Him, let him go. &gt;&gt; But when Jesus died, listen, come on, don't go to bed yet. &gt;&gt; The temple ve &gt;&gt; not because a priest tore it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It didn't It didn't rip from the bottom up. &gt;&gt; The Bible's clear. from the top down &gt;&gt; because something higher, something holier, something above, &gt;&gt; something that was not humanity &gt;&gt; rip ripped that veil. The veil that that God himself instituted, the veil that God designed, the veil that God told him to put there, but when a better way was made, &gt;&gt; sir, &gt;&gt; not only high priest, but look at that. Look at that. Whosoever will can have that same anointing of the sheckchana glory and walk a holy life. Don't miss that. Holy, holy, holy unto the Lord and approach in the very presence of God through the blood of Jesus Christ before him. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; "Let's go. &gt;&gt; I'm looking for one tiny little place. I know you're numb. I don't feel my legs anymore, so I must be numb, too. I know they're there somewhere. I wanted just to read one little tiny. It's real small, but I don't see it. If it's not the will of the Lord, it'll keep. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, he's life to me. Well, I don't see it. It's just one little tiny thing. Just a sweet little quotation between the wings of the cherry. I will meet you there. Oh, here it is. Right in my face. calling Jesus on the scene. But when the blood cell was broke, I want you to know what he did. No more lambs, no more goats, no more bulocks had to die. But when the blood cell was broke in Jesus Christ, I want somebody to tell me what was released. &gt;&gt; It wasn't goat life. &gt;&gt; It wasn't lamb life. &gt;&gt; It wasn't bullet life. God, &gt;&gt; deity, &gt;&gt; eternity was released. Now, wouldn't you want some of that to fall on you? &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; Change you forever more. He was God. The blood wasn't Jewish. That blood wasn't Gentile. That was a creative blood cell, God himself. And now through that blood making a propitiation for our sin, cleanses a believer, takes all of his sins away from him as if he Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that what it says? &gt;&gt; Let's check it. Never had sin. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Justification, isn't it? Justified. Never. Justified never sin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Read it on. Go on. God puts them in the sea of where? &gt;&gt; Don't you go fishing. Don't you go trying to dig them up. &gt;&gt; Not on me. Not on you. Not on your neighbor. And the same God that was upon Oh, that old song just came ringing in my ear. What sins are you talking about? I don't remember them anymore from the book of life. They've all been torn out. I don't remember them anymore. What sins are you talking about? I don't remember them anymore from the book of life. They've all been torn out. I don't remember them anymore. One more time. When the devil says you sin, what sins are you talking about? I don't remember them anymore [Music] from the book of life. They've all been torn out. I don't remember them anymore. One more time. Oh, what sins? [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, you sound good. &gt;&gt; You sound good. Look, &gt;&gt; they've all been torn out. I don't remember them anymore. Hallelujah. Clap your hands for Jesus. [Music] Oh, isn't he good? We're done. &gt;&gt; We're done. This week, we went down to the storage and and dug out the pulpit and the altar. Both of them at least 90 years old. It was the pulpit and the altar from the old Bellwood Assembly of God Church in Columbus. The altar bench is the altar bench that my grandmother knelt at in the Bellwood church and received the baptism of the Holy Ghost in 1949. And the pull pit was also the pull pit. She she was offered the altar and it became the altar in in the church on Hamilton Road and the pullpit became the pullpit and it was that pullpit that my Bible was laying on before I just young and and uh the fire the cos of fire were laid on that altar by little sister Cotney on the on the Bible on the pull pit and I hadn't seen that pullpit in a long time. In fact, we didn't think we were going to see it because it was under a mountain of empty boxes, but they found it and Brother Truman is tightening it up and fixing it up so that we can use that as the podium for the banquet. And I said to Brother Truman, I now if I could just have the old-timers back to stand behind it that I remember standing behind it. When it come time for choir, they didn't have no robes. They didn't have no trained voices. They didn't even have a practice. The choir was everybody, &gt;&gt; but they couldn't stay at their seat. That wasn't right. This is how I was raised. They said, "We're going to call the choir." And I know visitors was looking for the robe. And everybody just got up out of their seat and started walking over behind the piano. And there'd be 15, sometimes four or five, but 15, 20, 25. There'd still be lots, you know, some that wouldn't go and they and that was the choir. And they would sing them old songs and mean it. Mean it. Never saw folks sleeping. Ne never saw folks on their phones. Of course not. Disengaged or looking for something else, reading a novel or whatever. folks were so glad to be in the presence of the Lord because times were pretty hard &gt;&gt; and these were hardworking people in the mill and they they they needed hope. &gt;&gt; And I tell you, you reminded me, I have to be honest, when you joined in on that song, it took me way back because I thought I heard somebody sing it like they meant it. I thought I heard somebody here today sing it like they meant it. &gt;&gt; What sins? &gt;&gt; That's right. You're standing in his presence waiting on the book to be opened and your page to be read and he's just &gt;&gt; it's not here. &gt;&gt; It's not here. And finally, he looks down at you and he says, "What sins are you talking about? I don't remember them anymore. They're not even written here. They're gone. It is as though you never sinned." That's the grace of of justification. &gt;&gt; I want to sing this chorus. I know that you've got plenty to sing with him, but I want to sing one more chorus while I can before I sit down. Help me. When he sees me, he sees the blood of the lamb. He sees me as worthy and not as I am. He views me in garments made white as the snow. For the lamb of God is worthy and he washed me this high. Let's go up and sing just when he sees me. He sees the blood of the lamb. Oh, he sees me as worthy and not as I am. He views me and garments made white as the snow. For the lamb of God is worthy. And he washed me. This I know. Just a little bit. Looking down through the ages. God beheld the dying soul. Sin had brought separation, and never more could man behold. There must come a lamb, one whose blood alone redeems, bringing gifts to the father of the souls made white and clean. And when he sees, he sees the blood He sees me and not as I really am. Oh, he views me. Maywe [Music] has the snow for the lamb of God is worthy. And he washed me. This I know. Give me the verse. So he left that holy city, traveling on to the cross just to bridge the gul to glory. He came to rescue all the lost. By his blood, he entered into the throne room and on the mercy seat. He placed salvation. Well, glory. And when he see [Music] he see of the blood of the lamb. &gt;&gt; You see me views me as worthy &gt;&gt; and not as I am. &gt;&gt; And not as I am. &gt;&gt; He views me. &gt;&gt; He views me in garments &gt;&gt; made white. made white as the snow for the lamb. &gt;&gt; For the lamb of God is worthy. And he wash me. This I know. And when he sees me, &gt;&gt; he sees the blood. &gt;&gt; He sees the blood of the lamb. He sees me as worthy and not as I am. He views me in garments made white as the snow. For the lamb of God is worthy and he washed me. This I know. [Music] &gt;&gt; I saw the Lord &gt;&gt; seated on his throne. And he was clothed in glory, [Music] exalted high. And the train of his robe, it filled the temple. Oh, and the angels circled around him and cry that you are holy. [Music] Oh, so holy. Oh, you are you are holy Lord of all. And you are holy. Oh, holy. Oh, you are you are holy, Lord of all. [Music] For woe is me, for I'm unclean. For my eyes have seen the holy king. [Music] But then he cleansed my lips [Music] right before my eyes in the pillar show. As the angels cry, "Holy is the lamb. You are [Music] oh so holo. [Music] Oh, you are. You are holy Lord of all. Oh, you are you are holy and holy. [Music] Oh, you are the holy Lord of all. [Music] For woe is me. For I'm unclean. For my eyes have seen the holy king. But then he cleans my lips right before my eyes. And then the pillars show and the angels cry. Holy are you lamb. You are holy. Oh holy. Oh, you are you are holy Lord of all. And you are holy, &gt;&gt; oh so holy, holy. You are you are holy Lord of all. Lord, as we stand in your presence today, our hearts are full with the revelation of what you have accomplished on our behalf. And we are not here today to push the limit. We're here, Lord, to hang our head down, to lay down, to be humble before you, and to say, Lord, &gt;&gt; it's up to you. It's on you to lift us. It's on you to help us. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; We just want to get as low as we possibly can &gt;&gt; so that you the way down, the way up is to go down. &gt;&gt; And Lord, we thank you for the holiness and for the awe of God and the reverential fear of the Lord that fills our lives. We just want to say it's you. You paid the price. You had the plan. Your grace is sufficient. And you are holy. Somebody tell him again, you are holy. &gt;&gt; Oh, you are [Music] [Laughter] so holy. You are holy Lord of all. And Isaiah said, "For woe is me." [Music] &gt;&gt; For Ian, [Music] &gt;&gt; my lips, &gt;&gt; for my eyes have seen. &gt;&gt; Cleanse them today, Lord. Lay the altar, the whole &gt;&gt; on our lips like you did for Isaiah. But then he claims my limbs. &gt;&gt; Woe here and woe there. &gt;&gt; Right before my eyes. &gt;&gt; I'm the one that should be the most grateful. As the angels cry, holy is the lamb. You are holy. Holy, you are holy Lord of all. [Music] Lord, prepare our hearts. We're getting ready even today for a divine appointment with you in the coming week. And we want you to remind us, Lord. And may we find grace to remind ourselves of what you have accomplished on our behalf and that all we have to do is just find a little protocol. &gt;&gt; Make sure that all the dead cats are off the line and that everything is right between us and you and that we're not carrying any offense &gt;&gt; in our heart toward any brother, &gt;&gt; toward any sister. You've called us Lord to gather next week in the evening for communion and it's been some time and we want it to be a very thoughtful and sacred moment. We don't want to wait till the last minute to to make sure that all is well. So I pray Lord today that if there's any odd in my heart or if there is anything I'm holding against someone illegally, I pray Lord that you will show me and give me grace to settle that this week as I prepare my heart to come. And though we are not a people who believe that the bread becomes the body or that the wine becomes the blood, we are taught that it is the closest example and symbol that we have on the earth of those two holy things, your your broken body and your precious blood. So when we consume them, we consume them with the hope that the healing that lays within them will somehow flood our lives. bringing physical healing to the body and a spiritual release to the heaviness of the heart and the mind. Lord, we love you supremely above all things today and we thank you for what your presence has accomplished and we just want to leave here today giving you thanks, much thanks, many thanks, heartfelt thanks for your goodness and for your mercy and for your holiness. Lord, we pray one for another even now. Would you agree with me right now for the ones beside you, Lord? And those streaming this service right now, we stand together, our faith unified together, &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; believing, Lord, Lord, &gt;&gt; that you will bring healing and release and freedom not only to those standing in this room, but to those who are joined with us even now by faith and by internet connection. Lord, you can do it. There is no distance in prayer and there is no restraint to the to the going forth of your healing and your deliverance. We have so much to praise you for. &gt;&gt; We have so much to thank you for. You've been so good. You've been so good. Hasn't he been good? &gt;&gt; Would you just stretch your hands to him one more time and tell him, Lord, I thank you that you are my atonement. I thank you that you are sufficient. I thank you that the price that you paid is enough. It is enough. It is enough. You're not asking me to pay another price except to surrender, except to surrender. Except to come before your holiness with a mindfulness that sometimes I need another bloodbath. I need another sanctifying portion for my mind and for my thoughts. And you've provided that today in the atonement. And we want to give you praise. You are holy. [Music] So holy. You are holy Lord of all. Do &gt;&gt; you believe it? Sing it again. You're holy. Oh, you are. You are holy. Holy [Music] holy. &gt;&gt; Holy. You are holy, Lord. &gt;&gt; One more time. You're holy. God cover us in that holiness as we go out &gt;&gt; into this dirty world. Holy are holy. Oh, so holy are you. You are holy Lord of all. Hear [Music] me. All is walking in the pit. Cast your cares upon me. I am cleaning thee this hour for the move I will be doing. Lean upon me. Lean upon me. Cast it all on me. I made the way. &gt;&gt; Do not th against another brethren in your heart. Cast all things upon me. I have made the way. I am the all and all. I am the all and all and I love thee. You are my chosen people. I have placed my name in this place. I believe thee. I believe thee. I have promised it. And I am a God that keeps my promises. &gt;&gt; Do not let your faith. Do not let it go. The spirit is just inviting you to refocus on him. It's the enemy's job. He'll do anything. He'll He'll use any situation to distract us. The spirit of the Lord is just inviting us before we leave here. Focus on him. Look straight to the Lord. Do it with me. Do it with me right now. We focus on him. We look to Jesus. We look to Jesus. He's the answer, the savior, the deliverer, the sanctifier. He's the wholeness that we seek. He's the perfection and completion that we look for. Lord, we look upon you and live. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Even as the children of Israel cast their eyes toward a brazen serpent by the commandment of a prophet, we cast our eyes to you, Lord. It was just a type and a shadow of a day that the very God of eternity would humble himself to a body of flesh and be lifted up on a cross to draw all men unto him. Today, Lord, we look to you to live. We look to the cross, remembering the sacrifice, remembering the atonement. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Holy is our God. Thank you Lord for the invitation and the reminder &gt;&gt; to look to you &gt;&gt; to see you and live to see you and live to see you and live. [Music] Just another moment. Keep your mind right on him. Just another moment. &gt;&gt; I hope you're free from obligation this evening and we're not holding you in some way to hinder your your evening, but give him just another moment. Lord, we want to walk in the Holy, not just during a camp meeting, but every day. Every day. [Music] Then he cleans my right before my eyes. eyes and the pillar shook. Woo! As the angels cry, holy, holy is the lamb you are. [Music] Holy, so very soy. [Laughter] Oh, you are holy Lord of all. [Music] We invite you to be dismissed as the Lord would lead you.

I tell you, when you reflect on what the Lord's done for you, it'll make you love people. &gt;&gt; It will. &gt;&gt; Amen. all the animosity and the enmity in and the envy, it just sort of melts away. You just you just love what God's doing in each other. Lord, I love what you're doing in your people. &gt;&gt; Please increase it. Please multiply it. &gt;&gt; Please do it, Father. Bring us back at the appointed time and we will give you much praise. In the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we say, "Amen." And the saint said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." You're dismissed to go. Don't you miss your chance to love somebody. [Music] Continue to my phone. Continue to remember Continue to remember the the twins. Are you listening? &gt;&gt; Yes. I asked Luke if there was anything that he wanted me to share and he said all the labs have come back good and they've been weaning his oxygen down and they had upped it after they put the lines in but have been bringing it down every 30 minutes. He's at a 52 but they're about to lord again because he is tolerating it really well. Let's praise the Lord. Jesus, we praise you. &gt;&gt; Finish the work. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Oh, she is so pretty. Nanny, nanny, boooo, I got a lot of pictures. Yeah, I hate to be carnal, but there's a bin of things. Uh, somebody drag it out from under that table there in the vestibule. You would be surprised what we have that belongs to you. Would you take it home before I do? If you don't take it home, I'm going to see what I like in it and I'm going to take it home myself or put it in the garbage bin. and we're not going to keep it rentree anymore. Take your stuff. Don't you strut past it and say, "I know I don't have nothing." Cuz I've had to see people humbly come back when we discovered their name written on it. Do that for us. Would you get that cleared out Tuesday night at 7:00? Go in the peace of Jesus. Would you? God bless you as you go. We'll keep you updated on the app concerning these sweet little twins.
