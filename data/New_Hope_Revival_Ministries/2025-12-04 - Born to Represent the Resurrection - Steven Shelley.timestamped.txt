[0:00] The anointing is a person
[0:02] &gt;&gt; and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ. I
[0:06] tell you, if the bride has him, if we
[0:09] have him and he's on board and he's
[0:12] living inside of us and we're now living
[0:14] a Christ life, which is a life of
[0:18] anastasis,
[0:19] which is a Greek word that is translated
[0:23] resurrection, but it's NOT JUST A DEATH,
[0:26] a burial, and a resurrection. An
[0:28] anastasis is a reproducible
[0:33] resurrection. Amen.
[0:35] &gt;&gt; One that not only brings us from death
[0:37] to life, but it's one that we can PASS
[0:40] ON TO SOMEONE ELSE.
[0:43] &gt;&gt; And they can also experience the
[0:46] metamorphosis of anastasis.
[0:48] We can have in our very being a
[0:52] reproducible resurrection. THE SAME
[0:54] LIFE, THE SAME SPIRIT THAT RAISED JESUS
[0:58] from the deadl
[0:59] &gt;&gt; can now live inside of A PEOPLE.
[1:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN. PRODUCING the same life, the same
[1:07] Mark 16 signs and wonders. THE SICK ARE
[1:11] STILL HEALED. THE DEAD CAN STILL be
[1:14] raised.
[1:16] &gt;&gt; It's the mighty God revealed, unveiled,
[1:19] not only before us,
[1:20] &gt;&gt; but in us.
[1:23] &gt;&gt; JESUS IS THE MYSTERY OF GOD REVEALED.
[1:26] And the bride
[1:28] &gt;&gt; IS THE MYSTERY OF Jesus revealed.
[1:31] &gt;&gt; That's what the message has TAUGHT US.
[1:33] HE'S ALIVE and well in his people. And
[1:37] therefore, we must be an anointed PEOPLE
[1:42] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE FELLOWSHIP with the
[1:44] anointing.
[1:46] &gt;&gt; And that's not just a spirit.
[1:48] &gt;&gt; That's a person.
[1:50] &gt;&gt; There's only one in the Godhead. It's
[1:53] Jesus to us.
[1:55] &gt;&gt; Jehovah of the old
[1:57] &gt;&gt; and the Lord Jesus of the new. I think
[2:00] the need is greater today than it's ever
[2:03] been before for a living, moving,
[2:07] breathing Jesus among us.
[2:10] &gt;&gt; And when I say among us, I mean in you
[2:13] and in you and in you and in you and in
[2:16] me.
[2:18] &gt;&gt; We need him.
[2:19] &gt;&gt; We need him more than we ever have
[2:22] before.
[2:23] &gt;&gt; He can do for us what the doctors can't
[2:26] do.
[2:27] IT'S THE GOD WHO CAN DO FOR you
[2:32] &gt;&gt; what you cannot do
[2:34] &gt;&gt; for yourself.
[2:36] &gt;&gt; How many of you are glad you know him?
[2:38] &gt;&gt; How many of you are glad that he lives
[2:40] on board?
[2:42] &gt;&gt; HE CAN DO FOR US TODAY WHAT WE CANNOT do
[2:45] for ourselves.
[2:46] &gt;&gt; He doesn't change. Not in dispensations.
[2:50] He doesn't change. He's the same God. He
[2:54] just keeps unveiling himself to us. AND
[2:57] REVEALING HIMSELF. HE JUST KEEPS SHOWING
[2:59] UP WHEN WE NEED HIM.
[3:02] &gt;&gt; No matter how wild the storm is, NO
[3:05] MATTER HOW HARD THE TRIAL IS, we must
[3:09] not take our hand off the head of the
[3:12] lamb. HE'LL GET US THROUGH THE TOUGHEST
[3:16] MOMENTS of our life.
[3:18] &gt;&gt; He'll carry us over.
[3:20] &gt;&gt; No matter what it is we face, he's so
[3:24] good. His goodness has been chasing you
[3:28] ever since you surrendered your life to
[3:30] him. God knew my weaknesses. HE KNEW MY
[3:34] FAILURES AND HE ALREADY PROVIDED GRACE.
[3:39] HE ALREADY PROVIDED A WAY OUT.
[3:42] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY OF YOU GLAD THAT WITH EVERY
[3:44] TEMPTATION HE HAS ALREADY MADE A WAY OF
[3:48] ESCAPE? WE CAN GET OUT OF HERE AS
[3:51] overcomers
[3:53] &gt;&gt; as long as we're clinging
[3:56] &gt;&gt; not to just a feeling
[3:58] &gt;&gt; but to him who is the anointed one.
[4:03] &gt;&gt; This is what Messiah means. The anointed
[4:07] one.
[4:08] &gt;&gt; The one who personifies
[4:10] the anointing. How could the bride not
[4:13] be anointed if we're married to the one
[4:16] who is the anointed?
[4:20] &gt;&gt; How could we not be a supernatural
[4:22] people? I want to ask you today, do you
[4:24] know who you are? And if you know who
[4:27] you are, DO YOU KNOW WHAT you are?
[4:29] &gt;&gt; And if you KNOW WHAT YOU ARE, DO YOU
[4:31] REALIZE that you're A SUPERNATURAL
[4:33] PEOPLE?
[4:35] &gt;&gt; WE SERVE A SUPERNATURAL GOD
[4:37] &gt;&gt; who is HE DOESN'T DO SUPERNATURAL. HE is
[4:42] supernatural.
[4:43] &gt;&gt; And we need that.
[4:46] &gt;&gt; YOU THINK BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT A PREACHER,
[4:48] YOU'RE GOING TO GET A FREE PASS.
[4:50] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD WANTS TO USE YOU.
[4:52] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU A PART OF THIS BRIDE? ARE YOU A
[4:55] PART OF AN END TIME OVERCOMING BODY OF
[4:57] BELIEVERS? THEN YOU'VE GOT TO be used.
[5:01] &gt;&gt; And when you're a part of this bride,
[5:03] you're born for a big purpose. to
[5:06] represent. He tells US TO REPRESENT the
[5:09] resurrection on the earth.
[5:12] &gt;&gt; Did you know, BROTHER, SISTER, EVERY ONE
[5:14] OF US, WE WERE BORN TO REPRESENT THE
[5:18] RESURRECTION
[5:19] on this earth?
[5:21] &gt;&gt; You think that's a big calling?
[5:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:25] &gt;&gt; I think that's a huge calling.
