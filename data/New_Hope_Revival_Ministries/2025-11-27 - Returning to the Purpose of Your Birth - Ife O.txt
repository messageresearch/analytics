Description:
Samson’s hair was divided into seven locks, a sign of divine perfection and wholeness. Yet his story proves that even the chosen can slip and fail. The good news is that a mistake is not the end. If you return to the purpose of your birth through repentance, the shame of the past is wiped away, as if God doesn't even remember it .

God is not looking to merely visit you; He wants to occupy you. To prepare your house for this takeover, you must guard the gates of your eyes, ears, and mouth. This is the preparation for an anointing that doesn't trickle like a faucet, but rushes over you like a waterfall—powerful enough to wake up a sleeping bride .

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
So Samson was going to be a Nazerite from the time of his birth. He could come not come in contact with the vine, the grape, anything to do with the grape. He could not come near a dead body and he could not put a razor on his head. His hair was to be divided into seven locks. Look at how spiritual, how prophetic, how symbolic it was that his hair would be divided by seven locks. What a number seven is. Some people call it God's divine number. It's a number of wholeness and a number of completion and a number of perfection. God was about to bring a deliverer who would not only begin to deliver Israel, but he would set an example even for us today that you can slip, you can fail, you can make a mistake, but if you'll stay faithful, if you'll bring yourself back to the purpose of your birth in repentance, that God will not even remember against you the sin, the failure, the shame that you brought. This is good news. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I've disappointed him before. &gt;&gt; And so for me, it's very good news. &gt;&gt; In Judges chapter 13, verse 24 and 25, and the woman bare a son and called his name Samson, and the child grew, and the Lord blessed him. He was blessed in his mother's womb and he came from his mother's womb still under the blessing. BUT IT'S VERSE 25 that I want to emphasize to you today. And the spirit of the Lord began to move upon him. Born with a blessing, his childhood under a blessing. And then there came a time that the spirit of the Lord began to move upon him. It's a serious thing. It's not just for a special person. It's for whoever will surrender, whoever will yield. There's an anointing that is promised for the bride in the scripture and in the message that's beyond just a good feeling. &gt;&gt; Amen. HE WANTS TO NOT JUST VISIT YOU. HE WANTS TO OCCUPY YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND IN ORDER TO PREPARE your house for him to come and take over, YOU'VE GOT TO WATCH YOUR eye gate. YOU'VE GOT TO GUARD YOUR EYE GATE. YOU'VE GOT TO GUARD YOUR EAR GATE. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT TO GUARD YOUR MOUTH GATE. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you TODAY THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON YOU were born, God has an anointing &gt;&gt; THAT IS SUFFICIENT. HE HAS AN ANOINTING THAT IS JUST RIGHT FOR WHATEVER your position is. If he's called you as an evangelist, he has an ANOINTING THAT'S BIG ENOUGH AND bold enough and powerful enough to make you an evangelist. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If he's CALLED YOU TO PROPHESY, HE HAS AN ANOINTING THAT'S JUST RIGHT. &gt;&gt; It's not going to trickle down on your head like a drippy faucet. is going to rush over you more like a waterfall. Grant it, LORD. WE GOT SOME STUFF TO OVERCOME AND WE'RE GOING TO NEED IT TO BREAK IN MIGHTILY IN OUR LIVES. THAT'S WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN IN THIS BRIDE AROUND the world. SHE MUST HAVE A WAKING UP. &gt;&gt; AND GOD WILL USE A FORERUNNING REMNANT WHO WILL TAKE THE HAND OF A BACKSLID BRIDAL CHURCH. AMEN. IF SHE'S WILLING &gt;&gt; AND BECOME EYES TO SEE WHAT she cannot see. So, how important is the remnant?
