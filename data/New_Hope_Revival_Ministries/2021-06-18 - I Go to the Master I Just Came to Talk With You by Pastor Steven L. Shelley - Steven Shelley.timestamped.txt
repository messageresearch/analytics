[0:14] foreign
[0:17] when there's no place to go you think no
[0:20] one knows
[0:22] what you're going through
[0:26] when you've done all you can you're
[0:28] exhausted my friend
[0:30] there's nothing else left you can do
[0:34] when life overwhelms you someone betrays
[0:38] you
[0:39] you're feeling like nobody cares
[0:42] there's still one place i know when
[0:45] there's no place to go
[0:47] i can go to the master in prayer
[0:52] i can go to the master
[0:55] [Applause]
[0:57] he always listens
[1:01] he welcomes my please cause he cares
[1:05] about me
[1:06] he won't overlook my petition
[1:10] he's standing above watching in love
[1:15] waiting my burdens to bear
[1:18] oh he's got time for you and a place for
[1:22] me too
[1:23] i can vote to the master in prayer
[1:29] when the world turns on me i'm so blind
[1:32] i can't see
[1:33] doubts are everywhere
[1:37] when my friends turned me down and my
[1:40] spirit gets
[1:41] bound i can't rise above
[1:44] all my fears when pain won't release me
[1:48] there's no peace within me i'm feeling
[1:51] like
[1:51] life it's unfair when my night's sleep
[1:56] is lost
[1:56] i've turned and i've tossed i can go
[2:00] to the master in prayer
[2:04] i can go to the master
[2:09] he always listens
[2:13] he welcomes my police cause he cares
[2:17] about me
[2:18] he won't overlook my petition
[2:22] he's standing above watching in love
[2:26] waiting my burdens to bear
[2:30] oh he's got time for you and a place for
[2:34] me too
[2:34] i can go to the master in prayer
[2:38] if your life's a bit in i can still
[2:42] recommend
[2:43] you can go to the master
[2:46] in prayer
