TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the spoken creative word that caused the earth to come into existence that took body form flesh forms the invisible spirit of god the almighty eternal spirit of the Father we could call that a lot of things we can call it spirit we can call it light we can call it love we can call it a lot of different things but it's spirit and it has to find a way to become to manifest to accomplish something it has to have a form or a symbol a form or assemble in the Old Testament how did the logos manifest itself it manifested itself as a pillar of fire right but that fire was God but there had to be some other forms and manifestations of God because spirit can't bleed spirit can't die the eternal spirit of the Father could not be crucified and could not suffer it could not bleed so it had to take on another form when God looked at all of his attributes he decided in that one moment just exactly how he would express every one of those attributes for all eternity it all happened in one speck one eternal second because there was no time one second of eternity one flash of eternity God said here's how I'm gonna do it I'm let this happen in the garden I'm gonna provide this I'm gonna give a law I'm gonna have a temple I'm gonna have offering I'm gonna have sacrifices and then eventually four thousand years later I'm gonna step down out of eternity and take on a person the word will become flesh as we read in John 1:1 and I'm gonna bleed but I'm not gonna believe you Minh blood I'm gonna believe a blood that I create because in that blood there will be nothing provided from the mother and there will be nothing provided from an earthly father because I'm going to overshadow a woman my God have mercy I'm gonna overshadow a woman and she's gonna become pregnant just because the Spirit of God moved on her father was spirit the Heavenly Father was spirit and in order for you to have a sacrifice on your behalf spirit became body spirit became flesh creative word became body think of it this way the spoken creative word that caused the earth to come into existence that took body for flesh for it's so powerful because some of you may not be able to go this far but there's been a promise that in the last of the last days that same life that was in Jesus Christ because of the baptism of the Holy Ghost because of election because of a message that reveals Jesus Christ in a way that he was never revealed before and all the other church ages because of all that that same spirit life comes into men and women comes into men and women and starts transforming them from the inside out
