[41:32] He's saying
[41:34] to the doctor, "No more pills."
[41:36] And so we would ask that you would pray
[41:39] for him, his strength, his peace, his
[41:42] healing.
[41:44] We know God is able.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; God can just step in the room and make
[41:49] him whole.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Pray for his family that God will
[41:52] strengthen them and help them. continue
[41:55] to pray for baby Isaac that God will
[41:59] finish the work that he started.

[42:04] &gt;&gt; hospital's too long. We're ready for
[42:06] him. I know they're ready for him.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; To be home and to be breathing. It's
[42:11] improving every day. We're just
[42:14] believing God.

[42:29] Brother Hawk, will you come and take
[42:30] these needs to the Lord?
[42:32] [Music]
[42:34] I'm glad that our God is a great
[42:37] &gt;&gt; answering God.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; We're so grateful to him for it.
[42:45] And the people sing
[42:49] holy
[42:53] to the king of kings.
[42:57] Holy.
[43:00] You will always be
[43:03] [Music]
[43:19] Lord, we're approaching you.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; You are the king.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; But there came a time you stepped into
[43:28] this realm
[43:30] &gt;&gt; and walked in flesh.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[43:33] that we would understand that that king
[43:36] gave his life.
[43:40] You gave us your blood.
[43:46] It is redemption. We are the redeemed.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Father, would you help us to understand
[43:55] the blessing and the life that was in
[43:58] that cup, in that blood?
[44:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:04] It's because of that blood the way has
[44:07] been made
[44:08] &gt;&gt; for us to come now before you the king.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; That was your desire all along
[44:17] &gt;&gt; and also for you to be on be in us. It's
[44:22] because of that price.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; It was all your love.
[44:28] But oh God, I pray that we would
[44:30] understand right now the authority and
[44:34] the life and the power that is in that
[44:37] new covenant. And Lord, for Mom
[44:40] Williams, for brother Bobby, for Isaac,
[44:44] Lord, let that life enter into them
[44:47] right now. May strength and wholeness
[44:50] and healing enter into them right now in
[44:53] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. There
[44:56] is full deliverance
[44:59] in the Lord Jesus Christ. May every
[45:02] stronghold be broken down right now.
[45:05] Every hindrance, every hindrance in our
[45:08] mind, over these meetings, over our
[45:11] lives, may it be broken in the authority
[45:15] of the Lord Jesus Christ. Yes,
[45:20] [Music]
[45:22] &gt;&gt; how big it is
[45:24] &gt;&gt; to be redeemed
[45:25] &gt;&gt; by you, oh God.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; May we open up ourselves and allow that
[45:31] life to come in
[45:33] &gt;&gt; to have true fellowship with you, oh
[45:35] God.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; And we just pray, Father, that the rest
[45:40] of these meetings would would come
[45:43] according to plan. May you, Lord,
[45:46] accomplish what you want to accomplish.
[45:50] May your will be done, oh God.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; And we just commit ourselves to you.
[45:56] May every one of us right now
[46:00] with sincerity and faith, Lord, just
[46:02] whatever it is that you want to do in
[46:04] our lives,
[46:06] &gt;&gt; have your way.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; We surrender. We commit ourselves to you
[46:11] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[46:48] anticipating the camp meeting. And it

[48:55] [Applause]
[48:57] Sister Audrey, I'm glad that you're here
[48:59] today. Brother Gregory, I'm glad that
[49:01] you're here with your family today.
[49:06] I'm glad to be in the house of the Lord
[49:08] with saints of like precious faith.
[49:16] [Applause]
[49:18] &gt;&gt; I know that he is on every case. He is
[49:21] ministering to us. He is helping us. And
[49:24] we're glad that he is in the house.
[49:28] Brother Austin and Sister Anna Hodes,
[49:31] they tell me that you all have a song
[49:33] special for us today. We're going to
[49:34] worship with you as we receive the tithe
[49:37] and offering. We want to give as giving
[49:39] unto the Lord while they're coming and
[49:41] getting ready. I'm going to give you an
[49:43] exhortation of a of a small revelation I
[49:47] saw this week that I think might help
[49:49] you. So, we're giving of our tithe unto
[49:53] the Lord. It belongs to him. And when
[49:55] you read Deuteronomy chapter 14, you see
[49:59] at the beginning of the chapter the the
[50:02] laws of clean and unclean food of which
[50:05] I believe is the only ones that can be
[50:07] sanctified by the word of God and by
[50:10] prayer. I believe that you take it to
[50:13] the Lord for yourself. But later in that
[50:16] chapter, it talks about a a tithe. And
[50:19] because that I didn't understand it, I
[50:23] decided to dig into it a little deeper.
[50:25] I haven't dug all that deep, but it
[50:27] appears that it is a second tithe.
[50:31] It is a tithe out of the 9/10 that is
[50:34] left over after we give God our 10% that
[50:38] belongs to him to start with. And in
[50:41] that second tithe,
[50:43] it is that you bring a tenth of your
[50:49] crop, uh the increase of the seed. And
[50:52] the scripture says that if it is too far
[50:56] to carry that food with you that you are
[51:00] able to cash that in for coin and go to
[51:04] the place where God puts his name
[51:08] &gt;&gt; and buy it all over again, whatever you
[51:12] crave.
[51:14] Yes.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; If you're hungry for a steak, you were
[51:18] able to buy a steak as long as it was
[51:21] according to what God had put in the
[51:23] law. So as you ladies are preparing food
[51:27] and as you men are buying the food this
[51:29] week, I want you to just think about
[51:32] this that we are coming to the place
[51:34] where God has chosen to put his name and
[51:37] we are taking that that God has given us
[51:40] and we're sharing it with saints of like
[51:43] precious faith. We're sharing it
[51:45] together. It is a tithe unto the Lord.
[51:48] We give it gladly because he has blessed
[51:51] us uh to be able to do it. We're so
[51:55] thankful for all of his provision and we
[51:58] share it with God's people. And if you
[52:01] want New Testament scripture when Jesus
[52:04] was asked, "What is the greatest of all
[52:06] the commandments?" And he said, "To love
[52:08] the Lord God with all your heart, your
[52:10] soul, your mind, with everything that's
[52:12] within you, and to love your neighbor
[52:15] &gt;&gt; as yourself."
[52:17] And so it's a part of putting down the
[52:19] self, the selfishness and the selfish
[52:22] nature as we bring together this week
[52:25] and we enjoy some fellowship and food
[52:27] after the services. We're coming for
[52:29] spiritual food in due season. Brother
[52:32] Ellias, Brother Austin, will you come
[52:34] and get the offering bag and go to the
[52:36] people as we give our tithe and offering
[52:39] to the Lord, what belongs to him for the
[52:41] priesthood. That is God's command and we
[52:44] do it gladly because he has blessed us.
[52:46] Let's worship together as brother Austin
[52:49] and sister Anna sing today.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Blessed Lord Jesus.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; Jesus blinded all my darkness.
[53:05] He sparked my heart within. His grace
[53:08] and mercy lit a passion
[53:12] consume my sin.
[53:14] Now like a city on a hilltop,
[53:18] I'll shine through the night.
[53:21] I am a lamp made for his glory.
[53:25] I will not hide.
[53:31] I've been touched by a fire. So let the
[53:35] world come and watch me burn.
[53:39] Shout it from the rooftops. Shout it
[53:43] till everyone has heard.
[53:47] This love will never be extinguished.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; It's alive and wild and free. I'm
[53:54] overtaken by his power.
[53:57] His spirit in me. His spirit in me. His
[54:01] spirit in me.
[54:05] I've been touched by a fire. So let the
[54:09] world come and watch me burn.
[54:13] I'll shout it from the rooftop. Shout it

[55:31] it quiet. This holy fire is burning
[55:34] inside of me.
[55:36] I cannot hold it inside. I cannot keep

[55:50] world come and watch me burn.
[55:54] I'll shout it from the rooftops. Shout
[55:57] it till everyone has heard.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, I've been touched by a fire. So let
[56:06] the world come and watch me burn.
[56:10] Oh, shouting from the rooftops. Shouting
[56:14] till everyone has heard.
[56:19] Thank you Jesus
[56:23] for the blood
[56:26] applied.

[56:32] It has washed me white.
[56:36] Thank you Jesus. It has changed my life.
[56:44] brought me from the darkness into
[56:49] glorious
[56:50] light.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; There is nothing stronger
[56:58] than the wonder working power of the
[57:03] blood.
[57:06] The blood
[57:10] that causes sons and daughters.
[57:13] We are ransom by the father through the
[57:18] blood.
[57:20] [Music]
[57:26] There is nothing stronger
[57:29] than the wonder working power of
[57:36] love.
[57:40] that calls the sons and daughters.
[57:44] We are ransom

[57:52] The blood.

[58:45] the water of the word, the blood of
[58:48] Jesus Christ that cleanses us from all
[58:51] of our sin, all of our unrighteousness?
[58:54] &gt;&gt; It doesn't just cover it, it cleanses
[58:57] it.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; It washes it away. And we have been
[59:02] called sons and daughters. We don't have
[59:04] to come to him as beggars.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; I am so thankful for this message of
[59:09] truth that God has given to us to help
[59:13] us to understand who we are in Christ
[59:16] Jesus.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Would you stand with us as we are

[1:00:01] revelation,
[1:00:03] understanding upon understanding.

[1:00:10] us
[1:00:13] so that when we look in the mirror,
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; That's right. We're not seeing us.

[1:05:11] I'm not one of those.
[1:05:14] I still believe that you're unfolding
[1:05:16] and unveiling yourself
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; and you're causing this revelation to to

[1:05:39] Kings and the Lord of Lords?

[1:05:45] He's wonderful and worthy.
[1:05:50] He's so worthy.
[1:05:54] Praise God.
[1:05:57] You may be seated. He's wonderful and
[1:05:59] worthy to be praised.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; He deserves the highest praise.
[1:06:05] You know, I I had a hard time. Uh I I've
[1:06:07] never heard that so so so so so so good
[1:06:10] song. And I had a hard time getting it
[1:06:13] all in, but I did it. I did it. Um it
[1:06:17] was good. And I was thinking about
[1:06:19] Brother Steven over there. He ought
[1:06:21] singing the loudest. So so so so good.
[1:06:25] Because uh I think the Lord spared your
[1:06:28] life. Don't you? Amen. Slow down.
[1:06:33] quit giving the angels such a hard work.
[1:06:35] You you you're making it hard on them.
[1:06:37] But he really I from what I could see, I
[1:06:41] haven't spoken to him, but from what I
[1:06:43] could see, he could have left here, left
[1:06:45] a family to grieve.
[1:06:48] And I'm so thankful for the angels of
[1:06:50] the Lord that bared, bore him up,
[1:06:53] held him up. He didn't look like he'd
[1:06:56] been held up, but uh but he had been
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; and God has spared him. and they're back
[1:07:02] traveling and doing good. Good to see
[1:07:04] you. All of you. All of you. All of you
[1:07:07] that are here. We have so much to thank
[1:07:09] him for.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; We could never thank him enough.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Now, there's just a little bit of
[1:07:14] confusion in the house. Do you believe
[1:07:16] God's given us authority over it?
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; I don't know who brought it, but I
[1:07:21] wished you would have left it at home.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; You know, you may be used to living in
[1:07:26] confusion. I'm not.
[1:07:28] I I can't take that that element of
[1:07:31] confusion. It's it's it's certainly
[1:07:33] Antichrist. It's certainly not of God.
[1:07:37] And there are certain uh personality
[1:07:39] types that kind of thrive in that
[1:07:42] environment. I'm not one of them. And uh
[1:07:45] you know the word Babel
[1:07:48] uh for the tower there is also the word
[1:07:51] where we get Babylon.
[1:07:54] And as their speech was confused
[1:07:58] at the tower because the these uh smart
[1:08:02] elks, they thought we're going to we're
[1:08:04] going to build a tower so high and show
[1:08:06] God that he's he he's not so great after
[1:08:09] all. We can we can just march right up
[1:08:11] to where he is. And that same spirit
[1:08:15] carries throughout the entire scripture.
[1:08:18] started in the garden and it carries all
[1:08:21] the way through
[1:08:22] into Babylon. And there is so much
[1:08:26] confusion in Babylon. And that's why
[1:08:28] I've always been so blessed to read that
[1:08:32] there was a church
[1:08:34] according to the book of Acts. There was
[1:08:36] a church in Babylon.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; I greet you.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; And I said if if if they can have a Holy
[1:08:44] Ghost book of Acts church in Babylon,
[1:08:48] We ought to be able to have one in
[1:08:49] Alabama.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; And you ought to be able to have one
[1:08:53] wherever you are.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; And there's a remedy for confusion.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; There's a remedy for it. The Bible says
[1:09:01] they that they that uh that trust him
[1:09:05] and put their hope in him, he said he
[1:09:08] would keep our minds.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And in order for him to keep our
[1:09:13] minds, that means he settles all of the
[1:09:15] other stuff. the swirl. I I call it
[1:09:19] swirl because you feel it sometime. And
[1:09:22] uh I want us just to to as we get ready
[1:09:24] to go to the word, I want you to know
[1:09:26] you don't have to sit there in the swirl
[1:09:29] if it's trying to to get on you. I know
[1:09:33] I use language that's strange to some
[1:09:35] folks. I just describe it like I feel
[1:09:38] it, like I experience it. Uh but great
[1:09:41] peace have they which love the law, the
[1:09:44] instruction of God.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Yes. and nothing
[1:09:49] shall by any means
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; confuse or confound them.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; He said he would keep us. And I believe
[1:09:56] he will. Now, we're getting ready to
[1:09:58] enter into a a meeting this week. I
[1:10:01] think we've entered into it today. And
[1:10:04] if you think the devil's going to lay
[1:10:06] down and play dead and let you get a
[1:10:08] good blessing in this meeting,
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; oh, he's not going to roll over and play
[1:10:12] dead for anybody. He's going to wiggle.
[1:10:16] He's going to swish his tail.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; He's going to try to squeeze
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; like a python
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; and twist
[1:10:26] like Leviathan,
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; but he's defeated.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; My Lord knows how to take the dragon by
[1:10:32] the tail.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Satan like a roaring as a roaring lion,
[1:10:39] he just roams around.
[1:10:42] Sometime I wish people would be still
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; because when they're roaming all the
[1:10:47] time, it makes me think of the enemy.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; He's roaming around just looking for
[1:10:52] somebody, Jonathan, searching for
[1:10:54] somebody that he can devour. Yes, sir.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; And like I've told you before, that
[1:10:58] don't mean just gnaw on your arm.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Devour means to totally consume you
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; until there's nothing left. But greater
[1:11:05] is he that is in the earth in this bride
[1:11:09] than he that's in the world.
[1:11:12] And and if we will humble ourselves
[1:11:14] under the mighty hand of God,
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; he said God would exalt us. He will
[1:11:19] exalt us in due time.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; I feel like telling you today that you
[1:11:24] shouldn't be weary in welloing
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; for there's a harvest for you. You will
[1:11:30] reap in due season. Somebody say due
[1:11:33] season.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Due season.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; You'll reap in due season. But here is
[1:11:37] the key. If you faint,
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; if you faint not, you look at that word
[1:11:44] faint. It's very similar to a word that
[1:11:46] we would translate in today's English
[1:11:49] swirl.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Swoon.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; And he if if we will faint not, swirl
[1:11:59] not, swoon not,
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; no matter what comes or goes,
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; we stand firm.
[1:12:06] Then we can have the authority that's
[1:12:08] promised to this little bride. It's here
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; why don't you just put your finger right
[1:12:14] there. It is
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; the authority because the word of God is
[1:12:18] nye. It's near you
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; and it's even crawled in your mouth.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; That's what the scripture said. The word
[1:12:25] is nye even in your mouth.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; And uh if it's in your mouth, it's not
[1:12:31] supposed to stay there like this lozenge
[1:12:33] I've got. You're supposed to to decree
[1:12:36] it and declare it and prophesy it and
[1:12:39] speak it forward. Aren't you glad to be
[1:12:42] in the house of God today?
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Uh we're blessed. We're blessed. These
[1:12:48] musicians were blessed. Uh something
[1:12:51] sort of attacked Benjamin in his lower
[1:12:55] quadrant there on the left side of his
[1:12:57] stomach. He said, "I almost uh doubled
[1:12:59] over uh bent over double." And I said,
[1:13:03] "I'm not surprised. I I'm just not
[1:13:05] surprised that the enemy would would try
[1:13:08] to flop his tail around."
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; But uh he needs to know
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; that some of us are prayed up,
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; fasted, prayed up, set apart,
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; and ready to do business. Amen.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; For the King of Kings and the Lord of
[1:13:29] Lords. Let's start today.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Would you clap your hands for
[1:13:34] these musicians and the song leaders,
[1:13:37] song, the backup singers, the worship
[1:13:40] leader, the
[1:13:44] God's good.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Today is a is John Caleb, I mean Caleb
[1:13:50] John's birthday. Uh, hold up your hand,
[1:13:53] Caleb, so everybody can see you. How old
[1:13:55] are you today? How old are you today,
[1:13:58] son?
[1:14:01] Say it again. 10.
[1:14:05] 10. That 10.
[1:14:09] I think that's what he said. Just with a
[1:14:11] little slightly different accent there.
[1:14:14] 10.
[1:14:16] That's a good age.
[1:14:19] God bless him.
[1:14:21] Tomorrow, October the 6th, is the 7th.
[1:14:24] Is it seventh anniversary for brother
[1:14:26] R.J. and sister Emily? Let's say happy
[1:14:29] anniversary to them.
[1:14:35] Kirstston, is your birthday tomorrow
[1:14:39] or this? Yeah, Monday. Do you not know?
[1:14:42] Oh, you do know. Sorry, I didn't see
[1:14:43] your head shaking. Let's see. Happy
[1:14:45] birthday to Kirsten.
[1:14:50] My daughter Olivia Zion. Stacy's
[1:14:52] daughter, too. We share her uh her
[1:14:56] birthday is on Tuesday. She turns 22
[1:14:58] years old.
[1:15:00] That's old.
[1:15:02] Let's say happy birthday to her.
[1:15:10] Jubilee.
[1:15:12] Jubilee Miller has a birthday. He was
[1:15:14] born in 2011. How old does that make
[1:15:16] him?
[1:15:18] 14.
[1:15:21] You're turning 14.
[1:15:24] We were in Israel when you were born
[1:15:26] because we communicated with your
[1:15:28] parents when you were getting here.
[1:15:31] And uh I like your name. It's Jubel Lee.
[1:15:36] L E, but it's fun to say Jubilee.
[1:15:41] We want to wish you a happy birthday,
[1:15:42] son. Really, really do.
[1:15:47] [Music]
[1:15:49] 22 seems mighty young because Sister
[1:15:51] Isabelle Williams is having a birthday
[1:15:54] on Friday of this week and she's turning
[1:15:56] 89. 22 is a long way from 89, isn't it?
[1:16:01] We're sending our love today to Sister
[1:16:03] Williams. Uh she's asked before that we
[1:16:06] would call her Sister Isabelle. I can't
[1:16:08] quite do that, but I certainly love her
[1:16:11] and I'm looking forward, the Lord
[1:16:12] willing, to seeing her this evening.
[1:16:14] Let's uh say happy birthday to her on
[1:16:16] the stream.
[1:16:22] And then on Friday also is Lily Grayson
[1:16:26] Yovich. It's her birthday and she was
[1:16:29] born in 2018. So how old is she? 1921 23
[1:16:33] Seven.
[1:16:35] No. Seven. Where is she? Seven.
[1:16:39] Incredible. One more time. Happy
[1:16:41] birthday to her. Let's stand.
[1:16:44] [Applause]
[1:16:47] There will be no meal after the service
[1:16:49] on Tuesday night, but every night after
[1:16:52] that, Wednesday, Thursday, of course,
[1:16:54] the banquet is Friday. There'll be an
[1:16:56] afternoon lunch on Saturday for
[1:16:58] fellowship. Uh there'll be food served
[1:17:01] after the service on Saturday night. And
[1:17:03] then next Sunday, we'll have a good uh
[1:17:06] we will close it up. And boy, by the
[1:17:08] time you cook all that food and bring
[1:17:10] it, you're going to appreciate what
[1:17:11] Brother Gley said. Just remember, you're
[1:17:14] doing that under the Lord and you're
[1:17:16] providing. I don't know where some of
[1:17:18] you have been, but I know where a lot of
[1:17:20] you have been. You've been cleaning and
[1:17:21] you've been scrubbing and you've been
[1:17:23] digging and you've been watering and
[1:17:25] you've been organizing and this place
[1:17:27] looks amazing. So, would you give
[1:17:29] yourselves a hand for all you've done to
[1:17:32] make it look so beautiful?
[1:17:38] I just happen to look down here. I don't
[1:17:40] always look. I have this here for
[1:17:41] streamers, but I just happen to look
[1:17:44] down. Of course, uh girls, your mom and
[1:17:46] dad, they're streaming uh from the
[1:17:50] Netherlands, and we're very glad about
[1:17:51] that. Brother and Sister Ryder are
[1:17:54] streaming from the airport in Cape Town.
[1:17:57] Uh or they were a little while ago on
[1:17:59] their way over. it. But Sister Sarah,
[1:18:02] uh, who I mentioned a few weeks ago, she
[1:18:04] she has just put here, "My youngest
[1:18:07] daughter wrecked her car Saturday night,
[1:18:09] and I'm very thankful she was not
[1:18:11] injured. Her car was total." We want to
[1:18:14] say, "Sister Sarah lives in Indiana, and
[1:18:17] she visited here many years ago for
[1:18:20] several times with her beautiful family
[1:18:23] and I love them very, very much." And I
[1:18:25] was so thrilled when I noticed a few few
[1:18:28] months back now that she was streaming.
[1:18:30] And I am also, sister Sarah, so thankful
[1:18:33] that God has spared your beautiful
[1:18:36] youngest daughter and giving God all the
[1:18:39] praise. He's worthy, isn't he?
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. Matthew chap 26 and
[1:18:45] verse 29.
[1:18:47] I I uh I'm going to read the verse and
[1:18:51] then we're going to pray about that. uh
[1:18:53] any confusion that might be trying to
[1:18:55] operate on you.
[1:18:58] How do I know? Well, your mind if your
[1:19:00] mind is drifting around, the enemy is is
[1:19:03] trying to put you in that swirl. Bring
[1:19:05] your mind here.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; We're going to be very We're going to be
[1:19:09] very assertive this morning. I'm going
[1:19:10] to be very assertive this morning. I'm
[1:19:13] going to use a lot of authority
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; uh because we're getting ready for a
[1:19:18] beautiful uh evening tonight and we're
[1:19:20] getting ready for a week of meetings.
[1:19:22] And I believe that as this local body uh
[1:19:26] comes together this evening and receives
[1:19:28] communion and footwashing for the first
[1:19:30] time in five years
[1:19:33] that there is something going to turn
[1:19:35] for us.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; And uh I I thank God we we want the book
[1:19:40] of Acts.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; We want all of it.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; All of it. And some of it is blessing
[1:19:46] and increase and multiplication.
[1:19:49] And some of it is uh some judgment for
[1:19:52] lying to the Holy Ghost.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; It's a big book.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; It's got a lot of promises.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; And uh there's a fire that's that's upon
[1:20:01] this little bride. And if you hadn't
[1:20:03] been under it in a while, I just
[1:20:05] encourage you to get under that fire and
[1:20:07] let him cleanse you. Amen.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Jesus, this is red letters. But I say
[1:20:11] unto you, I will not drink henceforth of
[1:20:17] this fruit of the vine until that day
[1:20:21] when I drink it new with you in my
[1:20:27] father's kingdom. Does that sound good
[1:20:30] to anybody
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; besides me? But I say unto you, I will
[1:20:36] not drink henceforth of this fruit of
[1:20:40] the vine until that day when I drink it
[1:20:44] new with you in my father's kingdom.
[1:20:50] Praise the Lord. Now turn to Revelation
[1:20:53] 19, just three verses. So you, if you
[1:20:58] are able, you can uh also stand. Just
[1:21:01] continue to stand just another moment.
[1:21:03] Revelation 19 verse 7-9. Let us be glad
[1:21:08] and rejoice
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; and give honor to him for the marriage
[1:21:14] of the lamb is come. Wasn't Jesus just
[1:21:19] talking about uh a time that he would
[1:21:23] drink again the fruit of the vine, the
[1:21:26] wine with us in his father's kingdom.
[1:21:31] And now John is speaking to us
[1:21:35] prophetically. Let us be glad and
[1:21:37] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[1:21:40] marriage of the lamb is come and his
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; wife
[1:21:49] not just a spouse,
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; his wife.
[1:21:54] She now has his name.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; And in order for her to have his name,
[1:22:00] there has to have been intimacy take
[1:22:04] place.
[1:22:06] Amen.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Somebody has to to go into the tent.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; And intimacy has to take place.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Something has to be broken. Something
[1:22:17] has to be released. And a token is to be
[1:22:21] kept to prove that the bridegroom and
[1:22:26] the bride have now become one flesh.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? And so
[1:22:32] she's no longer just engaged or espoused
[1:22:35] as we sometimes say. She now has the
[1:22:38] right to carry his name. The wife.
[1:22:43] Someone say with me, the wife.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; That's different than bride. Yes, sir.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; It's another dimension, another step.
[1:22:51] And his wife hath made herself
[1:22:56] ready.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; The word is there to do it. the the the
[1:23:00] word is there to dress us and the the
[1:23:04] process and the protocol is in place.
[1:23:07] But you and I have a very important part
[1:23:10] in preparing ourselves as his wife and
[1:23:13] that is to completely participate with
[1:23:16] him in faith, yielding ourselves to the
[1:23:20] full effect of the word.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; It's it's a big deal. It's a big deal
[1:23:25] and we we need to see it as such. Uh,
[1:23:28] and he saith, "And and to her the wife
[1:23:32] his wife hath made herself ready, and to
[1:23:34] her was granted that she should be
[1:23:37] arrayed in fine linen, which is the
[1:23:42] cloth of humility."
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Clean. Clean. Somebody say clean.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Clean
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; and white.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Not off-white. Not beige.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Naughty crew.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Not tan. Right.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Not a hint of rose, white,
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; pure, without spot, without wrinkle.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Made holy, not by her works,
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; by her participation,
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; by her yieldedness
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; to the word.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. For for the fine linen
[1:24:24] is the righteousness of saints. You hear
[1:24:28] that, don't you?
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; There is some righteousness in the
[1:24:31] saints. It's his shared righteousness.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you can actually put that off.
[1:24:39] You can put off his righteousness. By
[1:24:42] continuing to choose sin,
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; by continuing to choose unbelief, you'll
[1:24:48] shed that righteousness of God. Brother,
[1:24:51] sister, I want to put it on. I want to
[1:24:53] wear his righteousness. I don't ever
[1:24:56] want to take it off. I want to be
[1:24:58] transformed on the inside of the inside
[1:25:01] because I'm wearing the fine linen of
[1:25:04] his righteousness. It has now become the
[1:25:07] possession. It has now become the
[1:25:09] inheritance
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; of the saints.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; It says the saints,
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; the righteousness of the saints.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; And he saith unto me, write, blessed are
[1:25:22] they which are called unto the marriage
[1:25:26] supper of the lamb.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham often said wedding
[1:25:31] supper. Same thing. and he saith unto
[1:25:34] me, these are the true sayings of God.
[1:25:39] Now, I want every one of you now to come
[1:25:41] together in mind and agree with me that
[1:25:45] nothing will be able to hinder you from
[1:25:47] receiving the word of God today. Father,
[1:25:50] we are mindful in this moment that we
[1:25:54] are somewhat in an intensified battle.
[1:25:58] We recognize that you have barrels of
[1:26:02] blessings that you want to pour out upon
[1:26:05] us over the next week. And as much as we
[1:26:09] desire them, and as much as you desire
[1:26:12] to pour them out, there's an enemy.
[1:26:15] There is a dark force that would do
[1:26:18] anything and everything within its power
[1:26:21] and realm and sphere of authority to
[1:26:24] hinder us from receiving the barrels of
[1:26:27] your blessings and the total deliverance
[1:26:29] that brother Gley was speaking about.
[1:26:32] Lord, we come to you today believing
[1:26:36] that it is not more power we need. You
[1:26:38] bought all the power. You purchased all
[1:26:41] the power. You you distribute all the
[1:26:44] power. But it is an awareness of our
[1:26:48] authority. We need a bigger awareness of
[1:26:51] our authority a and whose we are
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; in and who we belong to. And we execute
[1:26:59] a little piece of that authority right
[1:27:01] now. And we say to confusion,
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; you are not welcome here.
[1:27:08] We command you to take your flight now
[1:27:11] in the I know the door was open and I
[1:27:14] know that you were inadvertently
[1:27:17] invited into this place but we close the
[1:27:20] door now by the blood of the lamb. We
[1:27:24] close the door and we say you cannot
[1:27:27] come back. You have no business among
[1:27:31] the saints. This is hallowed and holy
[1:27:34] ground because your spirit, your
[1:27:37] presence is here.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; And so we ask that clarity would come.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Clarity would come in thought. Clarity
[1:27:46] would come. I take authority over every
[1:27:49] religious spirit. In the name of Jesus
[1:27:52] Christ, the spirit of hypocrisy that
[1:27:55] likes to manifest as a Pharisee. I
[1:27:58] rebuke you now in the authority of the
[1:28:02] blood,
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; in the authority of the word, in the
[1:28:05] authority of the name of Jesus.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; I command you to loose your hold
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; over the minds of the saints of God.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Lord, let the heavens be open over this
[1:28:17] house and may the blessings of God and
[1:28:19] the reality of your revelation become so
[1:28:22] rich and real in every one of us. Not
[1:28:25] for our credit or our glory, but for
[1:28:29] your glory. And may we be the
[1:28:31] beneficiaries of all that you
[1:28:33] accomplish. Bishma adonai Yeshua
[1:28:35] Hamashiach. In the name of the Lord
[1:28:38] Jesus Christ, we pray. And the saints
[1:28:40] said,
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. We're on a whirlwind
[1:28:43] now. We have to hurry. I want to start
[1:28:46] with a quotation. I don't normally do
[1:28:49] that, but I'd like to go to a little
[1:28:51] quotation from a sermon called
[1:28:53] testimony. It was preached in 1951
[1:28:58] in LA, and that's not Lore, Alabama.
[1:29:00] That's Los Angeles, California. In
[1:29:03] paragraph 45, the prophet of God said,
[1:29:06] "And you said, I will drink more the
[1:29:12] fruit of the vine." And we know that
[1:29:15] he's saying, "I will drink no more the
[1:29:18] fruit of the vine till I eat and drink a
[1:29:21] new with you in my father's kingdom."
[1:29:25] Didn't we just read that in Matthew
[1:29:27] 26:29?
[1:29:29] 26:29.
[1:29:31] Uh when we come there,
[1:29:34] when we come there to that great wedding
[1:29:38] supper and we look across the table, are
[1:29:42] you with me?
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; We look across the table at one another.
[1:29:49] Oh God,
[1:29:51] just to slip a little handshake over
[1:29:55] while the tears of joy rolls down our
[1:30:00] cheeks. And as I read this this morning,
[1:30:03] sitting at my dining room table again,
[1:30:06] those tears of joy,
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; I couldn't stop them from rolling down
[1:30:12] my cheeks. And my sanctified imagination
[1:30:16] carried me to a place not so very far
[1:30:20] away where there will be a table where
[1:30:23] there is a table
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; spread for a million miles long. This is
[1:30:28] symbolically it meaning that the bride
[1:30:32] of every age will sit down at that table
[1:30:38] and we'll be able to look at across at
[1:30:41] one another testifying to one another
[1:30:44] how we made it over.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; And you know our circumstances may be
[1:30:49] different but the way we made it over is
[1:30:51] all the same. We'll all say by grace.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; By grace through the blood of Jesus
[1:30:58] Christ. Church, if anybody in this house
[1:31:01] makes it all the way, you'll make it by
[1:31:04] grace. You'll make it by the blood. You
[1:31:08] won't make it because you know who
[1:31:10] brother Brandham is. You'll only make it
[1:31:12] if you know Jesus in an intimate and
[1:31:16] personal way. You must have your own
[1:31:19] experience with God. He has no
[1:31:23] grandchildren.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; You've got to know him in the power of
[1:31:27] his resurrection. You've got to exchange
[1:31:31] your earth birth.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Your earth birth for a new birth.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; That word born again means born from
[1:31:40] above.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; You have had an earth birth. You have
[1:31:44] been birthed here in this realm. But I
[1:31:48] want you to know that doesn't qualify
[1:31:50] you for an eternal place around the
[1:31:53] table.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; But there is a birth.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; There is a birth that qualifies you for
[1:32:00] a perpetual place in that table uh uh in
[1:32:03] the marriage supper of the lamb. Not
[1:32:06] just for a thousand years of millennial
[1:32:09] reign, but forever a in an eternity that
[1:32:13] will never end. That's the birth from
[1:32:16] above.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; So Lord, may we all know today before we
[1:32:20] leave this place that we have not only
[1:32:23] had an earth
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; but that we have had a birth from above
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; totally born again. That means that
[1:32:30] means saved by grace through the blood.
[1:32:33] It means sanctified by applying the
[1:32:37] washing of the water of the word. And it
[1:32:40] means baptized,
[1:32:43] filled to overflowing.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; The difference between filled and
[1:32:51] baptized
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; is you can fill up a cup
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; and stop at the rim
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; and you can say, "I fill the cup."
[1:33:00] That's the earnest.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; But there's something more
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; there. There's that portion that that is
[1:33:09] added that causes the cup to overflow.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; This is a baptism
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; and it's part of the new birth.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said salvation and the
[1:33:23] Holy Ghost baptism is not the same
[1:33:26] thing.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; But he said it requires the Holy Ghost
[1:33:32] baptism to complete.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:33:36] the new birth.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; He goes on to say, "The Holy Ghost
[1:33:41] baptism and the new birth are not the
[1:33:43] same."
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; But it requires a Holy Ghost baptism
[1:33:49] in order to complete the new birth.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Water, blood,
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; and then life.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; Spirit life.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Completes the new birth. I am persuaded
[1:34:02] that there are many people who are not
[1:34:05] born again.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; They they've just never had a new birth
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; and that's why they keep returning
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; to the beggarly elements
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; of this world.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Their new birth started. The process
[1:34:23] began.
[1:34:25] Some of you are looking at me like
[1:34:26] you're not familiar with how he taught
[1:34:27] it. Well, I can help you to be familiar
[1:34:30] if need be. It's a process.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; In the old days when you when you didn't
[1:34:36] go back with your wife, I'd like to see
[1:34:37] some of you try to get by with that now.
[1:34:40] You you you troublemaker you. No, your
[1:34:43] wife wants you back there. She wants you
[1:34:45] to be there so that she can bite your
[1:34:47] finger or do whatever she needs to do to
[1:34:50] go through it. But in the old days, the
[1:34:52] dad sat out there in the in the waiting
[1:34:54] room with his cigars or his bubblegum
[1:34:57] cigars, and he was ready to start
[1:34:59] passing them out when the news came.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; But that little nurse didn't come to the
[1:35:03] door and say, "I need to tell you the
[1:35:05] water broke. I need to tell you there's
[1:35:07] a there is a flow of blood that has come
[1:35:10] forth." No. No. She didn't come and
[1:35:12] report every stage.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; But when that life came Oh,
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; yeah. Yes.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; And if that baby didn't come here crying
[1:35:19] in those days, they put a little bit of
[1:35:21] that posterior protoplasm.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; You've heard the prophet, haven't you?
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; They slapped his little bottom and made
[1:35:27] sure that everything was all right. And
[1:35:29] his lungs were cleared.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; You couldn't say that now. You know
[1:35:33] that's not that's not politically
[1:35:35] correct because that would disqualify
[1:35:37] you from your tender parenting.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Let's see how quiet it gets now.
[1:35:46] your your little gentle parenting uh uh
[1:35:49] uh new age
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; psycho babble.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Psycho babble.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; It's not even good psychology.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; It's psycho babble.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; It's anti-word even.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; It's confusion.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what I'm more more mad
[1:36:07] at the devil about. I'm more mad at the
[1:36:10] devil about convenient parenting.
[1:36:14] Go ahead.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Convenient discipline.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Then I am gentle.
[1:36:20] Go ahead.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Because the only way to get to get
[1:36:23] through this is to be consistent.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Why don't you say amen?
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; So that means you can't correct them one
[1:36:31] time for one thing because it's
[1:36:33] convenient to do so
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; and then let them get by with it another
[1:36:37] dozen times
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; because you got your nose stuck in
[1:36:40] Netflix.
[1:36:48] You see, you're going to square your
[1:36:49] shoulders back tonight and march up here
[1:36:52] and you're going to take a piece of that
[1:36:53] bread and you're going to take a swig of
[1:36:56] that wine and you're going to think that
[1:36:58] you've done something. But I want you to
[1:37:00] know we've done nothing.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; It's not our good deeds that has earned
[1:37:06] us a ride at that table.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; It's his grace. It's his blood. It's his
[1:37:11] work. and and we we we know how to get
[1:37:14] them here. You don't need any preaching
[1:37:16] on how to get them here, but sometimes
[1:37:19] we need a little help once we've got
[1:37:21] them here.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; And you got your buddies over and you
[1:37:25] all are playing whatever it is you play
[1:37:27] and the and the child's the children are
[1:37:30] running like banshees, wild Indians
[1:37:33] through the house and it's not
[1:37:35] convenient to deal with them then.
[1:37:37] Listen,
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; I'm concerned about these things.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; It's trending down.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; It's not trending up.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; But I can't talk about that anymore
[1:37:49] because I got notes
[1:37:52] and I need to stay on them. But boy,
[1:37:54] could I Oh my Wow.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; I could I'm I'm sick and tired of people
[1:38:02] not taking their own responsibility.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:07] Yes, sir.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; And looking at you crosseyed if you use
[1:38:13] your your authority.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; We got to get this thing right.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; I want out of here. I don't want to wait
[1:38:21] on the last boatload.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; I want to leave here on the first cloud.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; The very first shout out of here. I want
[1:38:30] to go. I want to blast right out.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; I don't want anything holding on to me.
[1:38:35] And I don't believe you do either. All
[1:38:38] right. Now, we come there to that great
[1:38:40] wedding supper. Uh, in other words, let
[1:38:43] me finish that. The nurse doesn't say,
[1:38:45] "Oh, the water broke. All the blood."
[1:38:46] Oh, no, no, no. But when that baby
[1:38:48] screams, "Woo!"
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; She comes out, "You're a proud papa. You
[1:38:53] are a a dad of a bouncing baby boy." And
[1:38:58] he starts handing out his little his
[1:39:00] little gifts. There's no reason until
[1:39:04] life has come. That's right.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Your new birth is not complete until
[1:39:08] you've received your own
[1:39:11] experience with the baptism of the Holy
[1:39:14] Ghost.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Until that happens, you will continue
[1:39:19] without total deliverance. You can't
[1:39:21] walk in total deliverance without a
[1:39:23] completed new birth. You will continue
[1:39:26] to go back to that slop pit
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; pig pin
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; time and time and time again until that
[1:39:36] seed lodges.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; It's got to get deep down. And that
[1:39:42] comes from yieldedness to the spirit and
[1:39:44] the word. And when that does, brother,
[1:39:47] there will no longer be a desire. This
[1:39:50] is what he preached.
[1:39:52] That's right.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; This is what he preach. There'll no
[1:39:55] longer be a desire for the things that
[1:39:59] have hooked you in the past.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; I know how they preach it now. They
[1:40:05] preach it to get enough guilt off of
[1:40:06] people
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; so they'll keep coming to church, paying
[1:40:10] their tithes,
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; taking the communion. Come on.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; And hoping
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; hoping for a rapture.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; But that's not the way this message
[1:40:19] come. It didn't come to put you in a
[1:40:22] position to hope for.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; It put you in a position to know. So,
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; yes, sir.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; Somebody needs to know there won't be a
[1:40:30] rapture.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Without me in it.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; Somebody said that's pride. It is. If
[1:40:37] you say it in a prideful phariseical
[1:40:40] way,
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; but if you say it according to the word
[1:40:43] and the message, it's nothing but the
[1:40:45] truth.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; It's the opposite of Pentecost. It's the
[1:40:48] opposite of denominational Christianity
[1:40:50] where if you don't find your grandma,
[1:40:52] you think the rapture's taking place.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Now, because you got this word, you
[1:40:57] can't find your loved one. You don't
[1:40:58] know what in the world has happened. But
[1:41:00] you know one thing hadn't happened.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; There hadn't been a rapture. How do you
[1:41:04] know? Because you're still here.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; That's a no-so.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; How many of you want to get a no?
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Got to have it. Got to have it. When we
[1:41:15] come there to that great wedding supper,
[1:41:17] look across that table to one another.
[1:41:19] Oh God, just a simple handshake. Tears
[1:41:22] of joy rolls down our cheeks. Oh my,
[1:41:26] what a day. The king come in his beauty.
[1:41:29] The king,
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; the king comes
[1:41:35] in his beauty
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; and wipe all the tears.
[1:41:42] Can you imagine the King of Kings coming
[1:41:46] out to that great feast and with his
[1:41:51] with his finger wipe away your tears
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; that you would never shed another tear
[1:42:00] because all sorrow is gone and have the
[1:42:04] king to say to you,
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; "Don't cry.
[1:42:11] Don't cry.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; It's all over now.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Your crying is done. Your sighing is
[1:42:19] done. Your mourning is over. The battle
[1:42:23] is won. The pain is gone. Old age is
[1:42:28] finished.
[1:42:29] All the turmoil, the turmoil and the
[1:42:33] trouble of the pest house of the flesh
[1:42:36] and the reigning of Satan's Eden. It's
[1:42:39] all finished now. You've made it all the
[1:42:43] way to the marriage
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; and have the king I feel like doing
[1:42:49] something. I don't know what yet.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; Have the king pour you a cup.
[1:42:57] Yes, he
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; the King of Kings
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; pour you a cup
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; and say, "Don't you remember?
[1:43:12] Don't you remember that I promised you
[1:43:17] that I would not drink of the cup
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; of the fruit of the vine again?
[1:43:27] Didn't you read it in the word that I
[1:43:31] would not drink of the cup of the fruit
[1:43:33] of the vine again until I drink it with
[1:43:37] you a new in the kingdom of my father?
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; And you your little trembling, your
[1:43:45] little tremble, your your jaw tremble,
[1:43:47] your your little butt tremble. And he
[1:43:50] said, "The day has come."
[1:43:54] and he pours you a cup and he takes a
[1:43:56] sip
[1:43:58] and he passes that cup to you and he
[1:44:01] gives you an opportunity to drink again
[1:44:03] the fruit of the vine and he says to
[1:44:06] you, "It's all over now.
[1:44:09] No more crying over your lost children.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; No more wrestling around in the altar
[1:44:18] for the victory to come." Somebody ought
[1:44:20] to help me.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; No more stripes on your back. No more
[1:44:23] scars to be made.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; No more car accidents. No more
[1:44:28] motorcycle accidents. No more overdue
[1:44:31] bills. No more bankruptcy.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; No more confusion. No more hateful boss
[1:44:42] man.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; No more getting stepped on as your
[1:44:46] friend climbs the corporate ladder a few
[1:44:49] rungs ahead of you and uses you. Amen.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; To get a step up gone,
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; no more hurt.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; No more wound,
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; no more disappointment,
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; no more sorrow.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; And I saved it. I saved it. I left the
[1:45:11] earth realm. And I did not drink again
[1:45:15] from the cup of the fruit of the vine. I
[1:45:18] did not take another sip. not another
[1:45:22] drop until this day. And now I stand
[1:45:27] with you in the kingdom of my father.
[1:45:30] And I I want to share with you a cup of
[1:45:35] the of the fruit of the vine of the
[1:45:38] wine. And I want you listen. He said,
[1:45:40] "Oh, the tears don't cry. It's all over
[1:45:43] now. There'll never be no more healing
[1:45:45] campaign." Woo! Amen.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Why will there not be any more prayer
[1:45:50] lines or healing campaign? Somebody tell
[1:45:52] me.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; There's no sickness.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; There's no disease.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; There's no mental oppression, no
[1:46:01] depression, no schizophrenia.
[1:46:03] [Applause]
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; No split personality,
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; no anxiety attacks,
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; no panic.
[1:46:18] There'll be no need for a campaign of
[1:46:19] healing or a prayer line or to be
[1:46:22] anointed with oil.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; No more tired, restless nights.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; No more wheelchairs. No more walking
[1:46:32] sticks. No more knee braces.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; No more tendonitis. No more gout.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; No more achy joints.
[1:46:46] No more sciatica.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. That's enough to tear
[1:46:51] the walls down.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; No more sciatica.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; No more no more floaters in your
[1:47:00] eyesight.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; No more having to ask somebody to repeat
[1:47:05] what they said
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; because you couldn't hear.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; No more tongue tied. Amen.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; No more dumb in scriptural sense, unable
[1:47:18] to speak and to articulate. No more
[1:47:22] autism. No more ADHD.
[1:47:25] [Applause]
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; No more backsliding.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the king's got the cup in
[1:47:34] his hand.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; He said, "You made it all the way.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; I sat with you at a table.
[1:47:42] many years ago
[1:47:44] in the city of the most high yushim
[1:47:49] and I drank the wine and I ate the
[1:47:52] Passover uh bread, the unleavened bread
[1:47:56] and I washed your feet and I told you I
[1:48:00] wouldn't drink the cup again until I
[1:48:02] drank. Here we are.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; The day has arrived. The long hard
[1:48:11] battle is finished.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; No more confusion in your home. No more
[1:48:21] rebellious teenager.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; No more suicide.
[1:48:26] No more cancer.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; No more death in any form.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Somebody said no. No more three-hour
[1:48:38] sermons from Brother Jelly. That's
[1:48:39] right.
[1:48:41] That's right. But we'll sit at the feet
[1:48:43] of the lamb.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; And never want to move.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; Never have to go to the bathroom.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know. That's that's too plain to
[1:49:00] say.
[1:49:03] Some of you spend so much time in there,
[1:49:05] you ought to just take your bed with
[1:49:07] you.
[1:49:08] But no more.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; No more stomach troubles.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; No more not holding your water.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; I I I don't Look, I don't have anybody
[1:49:19] to impress. And I'd rather be raw and
[1:49:22] real anyway
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; because that's what I can relate to. No
[1:49:26] more ingrown toenail.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; No more Come on. That's right.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; No more trigger finger.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; No more big old swelled. Sister Betty
[1:49:36] Pilington. Her hands swelled so bad. Her
[1:49:40] knuckles and joints so deformed from
[1:49:43] arthritis until she couldn't even open
[1:49:45] her hand. It just got worse and worse
[1:49:48] and worse and worse. No more arthritis.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; No more COVID. No more pneumonia. No
[1:49:57] more flu.
[1:50:00] No more deformed babies.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:05] [Music]
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; When you take this cup,
[1:50:13] you represent
[1:50:15] all of what I just said.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; It's like a toast.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; Lord, you said you wouldn't drink it
[1:50:27] anymore. You've told me that as often as
[1:50:30] I would eat the bread and drink the cup,
[1:50:32] I would show your death
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; until you come. So every time I
[1:50:39] celebrate the fact that you died for me,
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; it's like a toast.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; I'm taking it from the pastor's hand.
[1:50:48] But one of these days, blessed be the
[1:50:51] holy name of our God. One of these days
[1:50:54] I'll take the cup from your own hand
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; and I'll drink that cup with you again
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; in the new kingdom.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; So this communion,
[1:51:09] brother Brandham said it ought to be
[1:51:10] called the Lord's supper. And then he
[1:51:12] goes on to tell us what communion is and
[1:51:14] why we ought to have communion.
[1:51:20] And so we understand what he's saying.
[1:51:23] Just taking little elements is not
[1:51:25] communing. Communion is, he said,
[1:51:28] talking and hearing an answer.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; You're talking with one another. You're
[1:51:35] communing with one another. Now, we do
[1:51:37] that with the saints in the natural. In
[1:51:39] the spiritual, we do it with the master.
[1:51:43] Yes.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; And that communion that we do with him,
[1:51:46] you talking to him and then shutting up
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; and letting him talk to you, that is
[1:51:52] communion. And this cup represents a
[1:51:54] small portion.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; He said it wasn't breakfast. Are you
[1:51:58] here?
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; It's just It's just 12:47.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; You should have gone to bed earlier.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; Just think about it.
[1:52:13] Just think about what we have,
[1:52:16] what it means,
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; what it says to us. He said, "It's not
[1:52:23] breakfast, it's not lunch, it's not a
[1:52:26] snack, it's supper."
[1:52:29] Almost every time he said it, he goes on
[1:52:31] to give us a discourse about uh those
[1:52:34] who confuse dinner and supper. Remember,
[1:52:39] depending on what part of the country
[1:52:41] you're in and what what mindset you
[1:52:43] follow,
[1:52:44] some people call lunch dinner and dinner
[1:52:47] lunch, and you know how it goes.
[1:52:48] Supper's,
[1:52:50] he said, but it wasn't breakfast. It
[1:52:51] wasn't lunch. It was supper. It should
[1:52:54] be taken in the evening time.
[1:52:57] He said, "It's Passover." He said it.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; He said it. You despisers of the feast
[1:53:03] of the Lord.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; He said it. Come
[1:53:06] on.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; He said that it was an annual event. He
[1:53:11] said that it was the pascal lamb.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; He said it was the Passover.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; He told us what it represented. And he
[1:53:20] said as the lamb was killed, all the
[1:53:23] lambs were killed in the ninth hour,
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; 3:00 in the afternoon.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; So was our Lord. Amen.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; And when we commemorate that with the
[1:53:34] communion cup, we ought to do it in the
[1:53:37] evening.
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; Even as the sun is going down, he said
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; to remember that it was in the
[1:53:44] afternoon, in the late of the day that
[1:53:46] our Lord died. It was in the late of the
[1:53:48] day that all the lambs, millions of
[1:53:51] lambs, millions of of bullocks, millions
[1:53:56] of pigeons and turtle doves were were
[1:53:59] were shedding their blood for for a
[1:54:03] moment
[1:54:05] of some kind of peace and hope that you
[1:54:09] could go on a little while longer until
[1:54:12] one day the lamb, the lamb, the lamb
[1:54:14] came. the spotless lamb, the perfect
[1:54:16] lamb, the bleeding lamb. He came and he
[1:54:20] finished it for all of us.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, and he said, "So when we come
[1:54:24] together in the evening and we take
[1:54:27] communion so we don't serve it in the
[1:54:29] morning, we serve it in the evening and
[1:54:32] we do that simply to remember
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; that our Lord took his last breath
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; just prior to the sun going down." We're
[1:54:44] talking about Middle East now,
[1:54:47] not Alberta,
[1:54:49] not Iceland,
[1:54:51] not places where we we have some
[1:54:54] variation in sunset here, but not like
[1:54:56] they do in some other places. Extreme
[1:54:59] variations.
[1:55:00] It's in that that last quadrant of the
[1:55:03] day, our Lord.
[1:55:08] And when we have communion, when we have
[1:55:11] the Lord's supper, we're remembering
[1:55:13] that.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; Isn't that good?
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; He said, "No more wheelchairs, no more
[1:55:19] graves. My God, no more mausoleum." Do
[1:55:23] you know it's very expensive to die?
[1:55:28] You got to pay them to lift the lid. Pay
[1:55:30] them to shut the lid.
[1:55:33] You got to pay them to carry the lid.
[1:55:35] You got to pay them to let your
[1:55:37] pawbearers carry the box.
[1:55:40] Everything. Everything. They know
[1:55:42] they'll never get this whole world never
[1:55:44] get no more money out of your loved one.
[1:55:46] So, they're going to stick it to you.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; But one of these days, and I thank God
[1:55:52] for the great undertakers, and I thank
[1:55:54] God for the great funeral home
[1:55:56] directors, especially those that let us
[1:55:58] uh worship like we want to worship and
[1:56:00] brag about it when we get through. I
[1:56:01] like them. I love them. I'm thankful for
[1:56:03] them. Not too long ago, two of them ride
[1:56:06] up out here in their big motorcycles.
[1:56:08] They looked to me like they it was too
[1:56:10] old to be riding motorcycles in the
[1:56:12] first place, but right out there in the
[1:56:14] parking lot, we just want to come out.
[1:56:15] Just want, you know, just see the place.
[1:56:17] And I But no more. No more need for
[1:56:20] Strifler Hamby.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; No more need for Vance.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; No graves. Hallelujah.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; No deciding what mama's going to be
[1:56:30] buried in.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; No more Amen.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; It's done. No more sickness. No more
[1:56:38] dementia. No more Alzheimer's. No more
[1:56:40] forgetting your name.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; No more having your loved one look right
[1:56:46] through you because they know they ought
[1:56:49] to, but they can't quite decide who you
[1:56:52] are. Finished.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; That right there'd be enough to make you
[1:57:01] want to go. Yes.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, for that great day." And
[1:57:04] then you'll say, "Enter into the joys of
[1:57:06] the Lord." Oh, I long to hear at that
[1:57:08] day, Father. Don't you want to hear him
[1:57:10] say that?
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; Let's keep reading. And now, while we're
[1:57:13] here together, and all of us longing the
[1:57:15] same thing. Make us true what?
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; Steward.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; Steward. You and I have a responsibility
[1:57:21] what we do and how we handle what's been
[1:57:23] given to us.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; That's why we don't lay at home on
[1:57:29] Tuesday night. That's why we don't drag
[1:57:32] in here late when we could have been on
[1:57:33] time.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; Because we're made to be good stewards
[1:57:38] of what God's done in our life.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; That's why we clean up.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; You don't have to be, you know, you
[1:57:47] don't have to be dressed like a movie
[1:57:49] star. Brother said, "Wear the best you
[1:57:51] got."
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; And we ought to do it. And and uh
[1:57:57] I should have let Austin uh Yantis
[1:58:00] preach that today
[1:58:03] because I got out of my car and I
[1:58:05] wondered who in the world is that
[1:58:06] standing at the door and look who it
[1:58:09] was. Look, look how they clean up.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; It's wonderful.
[1:58:20] Wonderful when somebody takes a little
[1:58:21] extra.
[1:58:23] I thought Brother Austin Hodes, let's
[1:58:25] get on the Austin's. I thought Brother
[1:58:27] Austin Hodes look very sharp this
[1:58:29] morning standing up there all skinny on
[1:58:31] the platform
[1:58:33] and swap it around them parts.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; It's nice when we can do that.
[1:58:42] There's a time when we we feel that we
[1:58:44] want to.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; And I love it when people do it because
[1:58:48] they want to. We're here together and
[1:58:51] all of us longing for the same thing.
[1:58:53] Make us true stewards. May we shape our
[1:58:56] lives. Listen.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; I want to look around. I want you to see
[1:59:00] me. I want to see you.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; I want eye contact.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; May we shape our lives
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; by temperance.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; By self control.
[1:59:16] Amen.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; Now, don't you think brother Brandham
[1:59:19] knew the devil had some power?
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; Don't you think the devil Don't you
[1:59:23] think brother Brandham knew the devil
[1:59:24] was dark
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; and he would tempt and he would
[1:59:27] influence?
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; Then why in the world did he tell us
[1:59:32] that we can shape our lives by our
[1:59:34] self-control
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; because greater is he that is in us?
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; The spirit of stupid
[1:59:49] needs to be cast out.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; It's just plain stupid to keep doing the
[1:59:57] same thing.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; Over and over and over again, hoping
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; that one day you're going to get better
[2:00:06] results.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Stupid.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; Somebody said stupid is a very ugly
[2:00:11] word. Well, we're not going to be
[2:00:13] polyiana today.
[2:00:15] We're going to be rich and raw. Just
[2:00:18] right nittygritty.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Thank you, Lord.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; If you don't like the word stupid, how
[2:00:23] about dumb? It's just dumb of us to
[2:00:26] think that we can keep doing the same
[2:00:29] thing over and over and over again,
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; expecting to get different results than
[2:00:34] what we got the last time and the last
[2:00:37] time and the last time and the last
[2:00:40] time. Amen.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; He said, "You've gone as far with God as
[2:00:43] you're ever going to go
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; until you're willing to pay a greater
[2:00:47] price."
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; People tell me, "I'm working on my
[2:00:51] relationship with Jesus Christ." And you
[2:00:53] see them doing anything and everything
[2:00:55] but drawing near to him.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; What are you working on again?
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; What are you working on again?
[2:01:08] It it it's so nittygritty now.
[2:01:13] It it it's so rubber meet the road now.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; It's so pedal to the metal now
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; that I just don't have one more sugar
[2:01:21] tit left.
[2:01:27] That's how I always knew when my
[2:01:29] preacher was serious
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; cuz he pulled out the sugar tit word.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; And to my little child like mine, that
[2:01:38] was like flat out sailor cussing.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; I knew he meant business.
[2:01:46] And when he would turn around and say,
[2:01:48] "I wouldn't give a tinker's damn for
[2:01:50] that." I thought, "Oh my goodness,
[2:01:55] we're going to have to have an altar
[2:01:56] call."
[2:01:59] I'll never forget Brother Cecil Hburger.
[2:02:01] Did any of you know Brother Cecil? Did
[2:02:03] you ever meet him, Shashana? Maybe your
[2:02:05] family might have might have met him.
[2:02:07] Dear, dear brother Cecil Hburger, been
[2:02:09] gone to be with the Lord a long time. He
[2:02:11] was a master watch maker and repairman.
[2:02:16] He took care of his wife, sister Helen,
[2:02:19] over 20 years of her sickness, unable to
[2:02:22] brush her own hair.
[2:02:24] I went and visited Brother Herger. He
[2:02:26] visited us here. I went and visited
[2:02:29] Brother Herger in his home and and uh
[2:02:32] saw his little apartment with with
[2:02:34] sister Helen. Saw how he had to pick her
[2:02:36] up and put her in the chair, how he had
[2:02:38] to take care of her, how spotless the
[2:02:40] apartment was. what uh he wrote a
[2:02:42] beautiful little book of poetry that I
[2:02:44] have in my office and he's the one who
[2:02:46] taught me what a tinker's dam was. He
[2:02:48] said it'll take a watch maker or a pot
[2:02:50] repairman to be able to tell you what it
[2:02:52] is. It's those little slivers, those
[2:02:54] little pieces of metal. They used to
[2:02:56] pedal them door to door. In the old
[2:02:58] days, they would take one of those
[2:03:00] little pieces of metal and they would
[2:03:02] repair your pots and pans. The guy who
[2:03:05] delivered them around with all the other
[2:03:07] wares was called a tinker. And the
[2:03:09] little piece of metal that blocked the
[2:03:10] hole was called a dam. And it was very,
[2:03:13] very cheap to buy a tinker's dam. I
[2:03:17] learned earlier than that what a sugar
[2:03:20] tit was. It was a piece of muslin, a
[2:03:23] piece of linen, a piece of something
[2:03:25] like a handkerchief and a a little piece
[2:03:28] of uh uh candy could be melted. a little
[2:03:32] peppermint or something sweet melted
[2:03:34] sometime in a handkerchief. So that when
[2:03:37] you gave your little baby paragarch
[2:03:41] which tasted like poison
[2:03:44] but knocked them out when they were so
[2:03:47] sick. They could take that little sugar
[2:03:52] and suck on it
[2:03:56] and soothe theirelves
[2:03:59] because in those days they didn't have
[2:04:01] 11 dozen kinds of paces.
[2:04:07] I called mine a bigger.
[2:04:10] A big guy. Kids call them all kinds of
[2:04:13] things. short ones, long ones, skinny
[2:04:16] ones, fat ones, rubber ones, plastic
[2:04:18] ones. Uh I guess this uh this uh you
[2:04:21] know uh environmental crowd, they'll
[2:04:23] have a wooden one before it's over if
[2:04:25] they don't already.
[2:04:28] And all mammy had all them old mammy was
[2:04:31] a sugar tit.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; Anything pillowcase would work
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; to sue that baby. Well, I want you to
[2:04:37] know I'm out of them.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; There's no time left now. If Jesus
[2:04:43] terried another five years, there's no
[2:04:46] time left now.
[2:04:50] I want to say if he terried another
[2:04:52] decade and I'm not expecting him to do
[2:04:55] that but I would still say today there's
[2:04:58] not one minute, one hour, one second to
[2:05:02] waste chasing your own tail like a cat
[2:05:06] or a dog in the field or a gerbble going
[2:05:10] round and round and round. It's time to
[2:05:13] break out Johnny Crow.
[2:05:18] It's time to break out, Johnny Crow.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; Quit going around in your circle.
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; Get off of that 12T shuffle
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; and sell out.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; Sell out today.
[2:05:34] and tell the Lord when you come through
[2:05:37] that line, I'm going to take these
[2:05:39] elements tonight as I have many times
[2:05:42] before in my Christian existence. But
[2:05:45] may tonight, may they mark in my life a
[2:05:50] place where I turn the corner.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; And I began to live
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; in the privilege
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; of a son of God. Yes, Lord.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; Meaning that I have the Father's
[2:06:05] authority given to me through Jesus,
[2:06:07] Lord,
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; to rebuke temptation.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; you can stay off of pornography.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you, until you can, this
[2:06:21] is what we ought to do. We ought to just
[2:06:23] preach it real hard. Until you can, you
[2:06:25] don't need a wife. You don't deserve a
[2:06:27] wife. You ought not to get you a wife.
[2:06:31] Yes, sir.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; Because you'll destroy what you have.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; You'll never convince me that God
[2:06:41] doesn't give victory.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; You'll never convince me that this word
[2:06:47] is not enough
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; if we'll come open before him
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; and keep applying that word in faith
[2:06:55] over and over again and confessing what
[2:06:58] the word said. You'll never make me
[2:07:01] believe that there's not total
[2:07:02] deliverance available. I know it for
[2:07:04] myself and I know it for you.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; And this mambby pamissified
[2:07:11] message preaching that goes on to make
[2:07:13] you think that you can continue on doing
[2:07:16] those things and living those things and
[2:07:18] just come up to the altar,
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; put your hand up, worship a little bit,
[2:07:23] go out and live like
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; we knew better than that in Pentecost.
[2:07:28] We knew better than that in holiness. We
[2:07:31] knew better than that before the message
[2:07:33] came.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; You fed that spirit and fed that spirit
[2:07:40] and fed that spirit. It's not just men
[2:07:41] and you fed that spirit and fed that
[2:07:44] spirit until that spirit is bigger in
[2:07:46] you
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; than your regenerated spirit.
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; The one that died so that the life of
[2:07:53] Christ could resurrect and live in you.
[2:07:57] Some will call it a soul. The Bible
[2:08:00] calls it a spirit.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; You can call it whatever you want to
[2:08:04] call it, but you better win the victory.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; It It matters.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; It does.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; There's only one person that's going to
[2:08:18] climb the holy hill of the Lord.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. the hill of Zion, the redeemed of
[2:08:22] the Lord, the overcoming bride. And
[2:08:25] that's those that have clean hands.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; And you don't have clean hands if you're
[2:08:32] still chasing that.
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; And you don't have a pure heart.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; Because you're not. Listen, lust is
[2:08:41] human desire. And you must, it's
[2:08:44] healthy. You must desire
[2:08:48] your wife. Amen.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; That's the one you're married to, not
[2:08:52] the one you're shacking up with.
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; The one you're married to, the one that
[2:08:56] wears your name.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; You'll never get your total freedom from
[2:09:00] anything until you understand there's a
[2:09:02] right way of doing it and a wrong way of
[2:09:04] doing it.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; You say, "I can't give it up. I can't
[2:09:11] give this up. I can't give that up." I
[2:09:13] had a I had a great uncle who couldn't
[2:09:16] give it up.
[2:09:18] He had him a honey.
[2:09:21] His wife was a holiness preacher and my
[2:09:24] great uncle had him a honey.
[2:09:27] And you know what? My my great aunt knew
[2:09:31] it. And so when he would come home on
[2:09:34] Friday, this disgusted me. I can't even
[2:09:37] hardly call this holy, but she did it as
[2:09:40] holy unto the Lord. She said, "I can't
[2:09:43] change him, but I'm going to keep my
[2:09:44] vow.
[2:09:46] I'm going to keep my vow. I'm going to
[2:09:47] do what God told me to do. And he'd come
[2:09:50] home from work on Friday. She would have
[2:09:51] washed his clothes and packed his bag.
[2:09:55] And he'd take that bag, bid her goodbye,
[2:09:57] and go live the weekend with his honey.
[2:10:03] She'd come home. He'd come home on
[2:10:05] Sunday night and throw that suitcase on
[2:10:07] the table. She'd get it, unpack it, and
[2:10:09] get ready. After she'd been in church
[2:10:11] all day, she'd get ready to wash it.
[2:10:14] He decided one day that he that he
[2:10:16] couldn't live without her and he drank
[2:10:18] some kind of a a drain cleaner
[2:10:23] and he was going to die. He said, "I if
[2:10:25] I can't have her, I want to die." Well,
[2:10:28] I don't believe in women preachers, but
[2:10:30] I'm glad I had one in my life until the
[2:10:32] Lord showed her the message of the hour.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; Cuz she didn't play with spirits like
[2:10:36] that. My granny went to the hospital.
[2:10:39] I happen to know
[2:10:42] went to the hospital and she looked at
[2:10:44] him and everybody was going in rubbing
[2:10:46] his hair, you know, his inside, his
[2:10:50] esophagus. Can you imagine? You put that
[2:10:52] stuff down your drain to eat up the hair
[2:10:54] and grease and stuff in your pipes. What
[2:10:57] do you think it does for your pipes?
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; He lay there in
[2:11:05] convulsive pain. They didn't know if
[2:11:07] he's going to live or not. And
[2:11:08] everybody's combing his hair,
[2:11:13] his wife in one corner, his honey in
[2:11:15] another,
[2:11:19] and my granny walked in and she walked
[2:11:21] over and she put her hand on his arm and
[2:11:24] she said, "Herman,
[2:11:26] come on. Is she worth it now?
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; I'm just backing up.
[2:11:41] What is wrong with you? What made you do
[2:11:44] such a stupid thing?
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; The family didn't know whether to attack
[2:11:51] her and run her out of the room or not.
[2:11:52] They just kind of bowed their head. She
[2:11:55] said, "I want you to know something. You
[2:11:57] know better than that kind of life, and
[2:11:59] you know better than to try to take your
[2:12:01] life."
[2:12:03] She said, "I remember the night
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; that you touched the Lord at the altar
[2:12:09] many, many years ago. You may have
[2:12:11] forgot, but God hadn't forgot."
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; And through his graveled voice, he said,
[2:12:21] "If
[2:12:23] she if I can't have her, I don't want to
[2:12:26] live."
[2:12:29] And I heard people in the room going,
[2:12:32] Oh,
[2:12:34] my granny said that's the dumbest thing
[2:12:36] I've ever heard in my life. One breath
[2:12:38] of hell will make you change your mind.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, they ought to ask her to preach his
[2:12:48] funeral.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; She said, "One breath of hell will make
[2:12:52] you a gener." Well, if I I I don't even
[2:12:54] want to go I don't even want to go to
[2:12:56] heaven if she can't go with me. if I
[2:12:58] can't spend eternity with her, I I I
[2:13:00] don't even want to go to heaven." She
[2:13:02] said, "Look, I don't have time. I don't
[2:13:04] have time to play these little silly
[2:13:05] games with you. You better call on the
[2:13:08] Lord. You may have less than 24 hours to
[2:13:10] live. You better call on the Lord. And
[2:13:13] you better send that hussy out of this
[2:13:16] room.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; Back where she belongs. And you better
[2:13:21] grab a hold of that saint of God that
[2:13:24] you stood at an altar and made a vow
[2:13:27] with
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; or in hell like the rich man, you're
[2:13:31] going to lift up your eyes and cry out
[2:13:33] in torment.
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "What do you do? Throw
[2:13:37] y'all out of the room." No. Cried,
[2:13:39] called on the Lord,
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; turned his life around.
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; And God raised him up. And he outlived
[2:13:48] his honey wherever she was. He outlived
[2:13:52] his wife.
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; He outlived my grandmother
[2:13:57] and my grandfather.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:14:02] &gt;&gt; I just recently reconnected with a
[2:14:04] cousin who told me that in the last days
[2:14:08] of his life, he was still sharing that
[2:14:11] testimony.
[2:14:13] I don't have to spend an eternity in
[2:14:15] hell because somebody told me
[2:14:18] [Applause]
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; that my little fun
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; was not worth my soul.
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; We don't hear this kind of preaching in
[2:14:29] the message because we all have this
[2:14:30] great concept of predestination and
[2:14:33] election and destiny and purpose and and
[2:14:35] God knew before we knew and and I
[2:14:37] believe every bit of that with all my
[2:14:39] heart. But I want you to know, you can
[2:14:41] fool yourself.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's good.
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; And lose all reward.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; All victory. And here's the worst part.
[2:14:51] You can drag somebody beside you, your
[2:14:53] lovely wife, your your your husband,
[2:14:56] your children, your impressionable
[2:14:59] little ones around you. You can drag
[2:15:01] them out of the victory with you. I
[2:15:03] wouldn't do that if I were you. I would
[2:15:05] make up my mind that the price that
[2:15:07] Jesus paid is sufficient.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; It is sufficient. And all I have to do
[2:15:13] is make the right choice and keep making
[2:15:16] the right choice and flee.
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; get it out.
[2:15:25] I don't believe in uh a lot of these
[2:15:27] things that go on the Pentecostal and
[2:15:28] charismatic world, but I've told you
[2:15:30] many times that that youth pastor down
[2:15:32] in Brownsville. And the only reason why
[2:15:34] I would have known anything about what
[2:15:35] was going on is because of the
[2:15:37] Kilpatrick family that my grandmother
[2:15:39] prayed for Sister Kilpatrick across the
[2:15:42] river in Columbus. And God healed her
[2:15:44] and uh uh gave her her life and her son,
[2:15:49] we called him out, they call him John
[2:15:51] now, pastored that church in Pensacola.
[2:15:54] And the youth pastor there had to sit
[2:15:57] his little family down one day in the
[2:15:59] midst of what they called revival and
[2:16:01] say, "I cannot have the internet in the
[2:16:03] home anymore."
[2:16:05] Now, they don't do like this in the
[2:16:06] assembly of God. This is radical.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; He said, "I can't have the internet
[2:16:13] anymore. I'm so sorry that you children
[2:16:15] are going to have to find other means to
[2:16:16] do your schoolwork, your your work, the
[2:16:19] things that you do, and the games you
[2:16:20] play, and the fun you have. And it is
[2:16:23] not because I can't trust you. It is
[2:16:25] because daddy can't trust himself.
[2:16:31] &gt;&gt; I've got to come clean before my family.
[2:16:33] And I and he went to church and he came
[2:16:35] clean before the whole crowd from all
[2:16:38] over the world. Come there for revival.
[2:16:39] He said, "I was not able for I was not
[2:16:42] able to control. I was not able I was
[2:16:44] not able. So, I have to be the only
[2:16:46] person in the whole church
[2:16:49] that doesn't have the internet on my
[2:16:51] phone and doesn't have the internet
[2:16:53] piped in my home because I just do not
[2:16:56] seem to have enough self-control.
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; No wonder Brother Brandon said, "May we
[2:17:02] shape our lives
[2:17:04] by self-control."
[2:17:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; That we'll know by the help of the Holy
[2:17:10] Spirit. Put that back. Thank you. put by
[2:17:12] by the help of the Holy Spirit to have
[2:17:15] full confidence that Jesus will say,
[2:17:16] "I've got to have full confidence. I've
[2:17:19] got to have full confidence. I don't
[2:17:21] want to wait and get it next week. I
[2:17:23] want to get it before the the the the
[2:17:25] bread on my lip tonight. I want it. I
[2:17:28] want full confidence that I'm going to
[2:17:30] hear well done, my good and faithful
[2:17:32] servant on that day. I want it now. I
[2:17:35] want it before I taste the wine." Amen.
[2:17:38] Amen.
[2:17:46] 112. Good. Got 45 more minutes.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you, my brother.
[2:17:53] Glory be to God.
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; Genesis 12:1-3. Let's go there quickly.
[2:17:58] Now, the Lord had said unto Abram, "Get
[2:18:00] thee out of thy You." You You act like
[2:18:02] you're mad, Brother Shel. I'm not at all
[2:18:04] mad. I told you I've been under a burden
[2:18:06] from the Lord for months now.
[2:18:09] I told you I can't sleep.
[2:18:12] I told you that that I I can't enjoy
[2:18:16] life.
[2:18:19] I can't have fellowship.
[2:18:23] I get so nervous. I can't I can't hardly
[2:18:26] come out after a service
[2:18:30] and I can't help it. I didn't ask for
[2:18:32] it. I didn't choose it. Don't even
[2:18:34] particularly like it.
[2:18:37] People will say, "What's it like?" I
[2:18:39] don't know how to describe it.
[2:18:41] Can you teach us about Don't know. Don't
[2:18:43] know how to tell you. Don't don't know
[2:18:44] how to tell you. I just know. And if any
[2:18:46] of you have ever had anything like it or
[2:18:48] similar to it, it just consumes you.
[2:18:51] Jesus is he's platting the the whip to
[2:18:53] drive the money changers out of the his
[2:18:55] father's house. He the zeal of the
[2:18:57] Lord's house. He he fulfilled the
[2:18:59] prophecy of the Old Testament prophet.
[2:19:01] The zeal of the Lord's house has
[2:19:03] confused has consumed excuse me. The
[2:19:06] zeal of the Lord's house has consumed
[2:19:08] me. The things that matter matter. The
[2:19:11] things that don't matter matter.
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; Don't. The things that matter matter.
[2:19:16] The things that don't matter don't
[2:19:18] matter.
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; And we've got to find out what matters.
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; And what don't matter. Integrity
[2:19:24] matters. Honesty matters. The fruit of
[2:19:27] the spirit matter. The character of
[2:19:30] Jesus Christ matters. The attributes of
[2:19:33] the Holy Ghost matter.
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; It matters.
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:19:40] &gt;&gt; how much your tide check is, that
[2:19:42] doesn't matter. Just give him what
[2:19:44] belongs to him.
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; If it's two might, your two might is
[2:19:49] just as important, special, treasured,
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; obedient
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; as someone who writes a $1,000 check.
[2:19:57] Amen.
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; If anyone here can prove or has even a
[2:20:02] legitimate
[2:20:03] complaint against me in 35 years of
[2:20:08] pastoring this church that I have
[2:20:11] treated people differently because of
[2:20:13] what they could do for me or because of
[2:20:15] what they gave to the church. I'd like
[2:20:17] to see the evidence.
[2:20:20] And let me tell you why. Because of that
[2:20:22] old granny.
[2:20:24] That's why. That's why. Don't because of
[2:20:28] her teaching me. You're not looking to
[2:20:31] people
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; for your source.
[2:20:34] &gt;&gt; You're looking to the God. The one who
[2:20:35] hired you.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; The one who hired you is the only one
[2:20:38] that can fire you.
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; And if you start looking to people for
[2:20:42] your source and supply, you'll miss it
[2:20:44] every time. You'll miss him.
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; You'll get out of fellowship with him.
[2:20:47] You look to him and don't matter. Don't
[2:20:50] matter. It does not matter who God uses
[2:20:52] to meet your need. Amen.
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; It's him.
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; I've tried to live by that motto. So,
[2:20:59] it's not what you can do for us, what
[2:21:01] you can do for the church, or what how
[2:21:04] much is on your tithe check. Those
[2:21:06] things do not matter. Be faithful.
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; Matters.
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; I know this is rough. I I know. I know.
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; But there's barrels of blessings.
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; If you want to line up to get them, I
[2:21:21] want to line up to get them. Now the
[2:21:23] Lord said unto Abram, "Get thee out of
[2:21:24] thy country, from thy kindred, from thy
[2:21:26] father's house, unto a land, and I will
[2:21:28] show thee, and I will make of thee a
[2:21:29] great nation, and I will bless thee.
[2:21:31] Make thy name great, and thou shalt be a
[2:21:33] blessing, and I will bless them that
[2:21:34] bless thee. Curse him that cursseeth
[2:21:37] thee, and in thee shall all families of
[2:21:40] the earth be blessed." I don't even have
[2:21:42] time to talk about the thousands of ways
[2:21:44] that God has fulfilled that promise to
[2:21:47] Abraham. through the seed of Abraham,
[2:21:49] through the in through the ingenuity and
[2:21:53] the brilliance of the Jewish people.
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:56] &gt;&gt; Who are light years above in medical
[2:22:00] procedures,
[2:22:02] in disease treatment.
[2:22:05] I I could go, you know, you know, you
[2:22:07] know, you know, because I had a friend
[2:22:09] who was there at the Wiseman Institute
[2:22:12] and you know that they were they were
[2:22:15] literally bringing healing to people
[2:22:18] with Lou Garerig's disease.
[2:22:23] The technology is cheap
[2:22:26] and available.
[2:22:31] It would be much cheaper to do it here,
[2:22:34] to make it here, to produce it here than
[2:22:36] it is there. Cost hundreds of thousands
[2:22:39] of dollars for the full band of
[2:22:40] treatment if you go to Israel. But we
[2:22:42] could do the same thing here. But do you
[2:22:45] think in your lifetime if Jesus Terry,
[2:22:47] do you think in your lifetime it would
[2:22:48] ever go through all of its processes of
[2:22:50] approval?
[2:22:52] You think the drug companies would back
[2:22:54] off and let somebody build a little
[2:22:56] little contraption or something that you
[2:22:58] can build from the hardware store and
[2:23:00] and reverse lug? No, no, no, no, no.
[2:23:03] That's the world we live in. I was in I
[2:23:07] was sitting in Washington DC in the room
[2:23:09] where a man who had had not walked who
[2:23:12] had not been able to move totally
[2:23:15] paralyzed quadriplegic
[2:23:18] and and in Israel they created by by
[2:23:20] their by their brilliance and ingenuity
[2:23:23] a a suit. And I watched this man as they
[2:23:27] strapped that suit on him and he took
[2:23:29] his few first steps across that stage
[2:23:33] with a suit with a with a contraption
[2:23:36] that is able to cause a man with no
[2:23:40] nerve communication to be able to walk.
[2:23:43] God said every nation of the earth will
[2:23:45] be blessed
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; because of your seed Abraham. Now does
[2:23:49] anybody believe God's kept his word?
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; He has. In the message Melzdc the the
[2:23:54] great prince and king paragraph 131 and
[2:23:57] Abraham left the land sojourn called
[2:23:59] himself a stranger and a pilgrim. And
[2:24:01] look Abraham as all mortals not an
[2:24:03] immortal man not a man that can't make a
[2:24:06] mistake but constantly made mistakes.
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; Hear this.
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; Do you have hope?
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; Are you like me? You always making
[2:24:15] mistakes. There's hope for you and
[2:24:17] Abraham. There's hope for me and
[2:24:19] Abraham.
[2:24:20] But no matter how many mistakes he made,
[2:24:24] his anchor still what?
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; Why?
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; Anybody in here got a promise?
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; I don't see you. I don't hear you.
[2:24:33] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; Anybody in here got a promise?
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; Anybody got an anchor holding?
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; You'll make mistakes. You you and I just
[2:24:45] got to smarten up and quit making the
[2:24:47] same ones over and over and over and
[2:24:49] over and over again because we're making
[2:24:51] excuses for them instead of getting
[2:24:52] deliverance for them.
[2:24:55] &gt;&gt; But we're going to make mistakes. So
[2:24:56] don't you think that anybody in this
[2:24:58] house is perfect? We all have to run
[2:25:00] back to him. But boy, once you find out
[2:25:02] how easy it is
[2:25:04] &gt;&gt; to run back to him, you will. You will.
[2:25:06] You'll run back and forth. He But no
[2:25:09] matter how many his anchor held for he
[2:25:11] had a promise. Verse four and five of 12
[2:25:13] tells us that Abram departed. The Lord
[2:25:16] had spoken unto him. Lot went with him.
[2:25:18] Abram was how old? 75 years old. When he
[2:25:20] departed out of Heron, 75 years old, he
[2:25:24] took Sarai his wife, and Lot his
[2:25:26] brother's son. That would be his nephew.
[2:25:27] Correct. Uh and all their substance that
[2:25:30] he had gathered, and the souls that had
[2:25:32] gotten in Haron, and they went forth to
[2:25:35] go into the land of Canaan, and into the
[2:25:36] land of Canaan did what? They came in in
[2:25:40] the in the message. uh MelzDC again
[2:25:43] paragraph 133. I'm I'm hurrying but I
[2:25:45] will slow down in a moment when it
[2:25:46] matters. So he took with him Sarah. He
[2:25:49] took Lot. He took his daddy. And as long
[2:25:50] as there was with him, God could not
[2:25:52] bless him. As long as they was with him,
[2:25:54] God could not bless him. There had to be
[2:25:56] a separation. That old man finally died.
[2:26:00] They buried him. He went up on a little
[2:26:02] farther and Lot backslid.
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; And you know what happened there? And
[2:26:07] then he separated himself from him.
[2:26:10] his nephew
[2:26:12] lost his dad.
[2:26:15] Old-timers dying out and now Lot
[2:26:19] backslid. And he had to separate
[2:26:22] himself. I preached a series seven
[2:26:23] separations of Abraham. And now he has
[2:26:26] to pull away from from the from the real
[2:26:28] relative other than his wife. It's his
[2:26:30] nephew. And then God appeared to him
[2:26:32] again. When when did God appear to him
[2:26:35] again? When he separated himself.
[2:26:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:40] Hallelujah.
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; From those who would frustrate the
[2:26:44] purposes of God in his life.
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; You don't have time to play with a sand
[2:26:49] valley. You don't have time to play with
[2:26:51] a Tobaya. The work is great. The work is
[2:26:54] large. And we are separated on the wall.
[2:26:59] In whatsoever place thou hearest the
[2:27:01] sound of the trumpet, resort ye there,
[2:27:04] for our God shall fight for us. Praise
[2:27:09] the Lord.
[2:27:10] &gt;&gt; What are you saying? I'm saying you're
[2:27:13] building a wall.
[2:27:14] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:27:16] &gt;&gt; And your buddies
[2:27:19] &gt;&gt; a little fox.
[2:27:21] &gt;&gt; Brush up against the wall. The whole
[2:27:22] thing would fall in. Now,
[2:27:25] &gt;&gt; how do you know so much about sand
[2:27:27] ballads and Tobias? Cuz I've gone to
[2:27:28] church with them my entire 50 years of
[2:27:30] serving the Lord.
[2:27:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; There's always going to be a sand
[2:27:35] ballad. There's always going to be a
[2:27:36] Tobaya. There's always going to be
[2:27:39] somebody. There'll always be somebody
[2:27:40] raise up among you and say, "You'll
[2:27:42] never fill up this church again.
[2:27:46] &gt;&gt; You'll never build a building. You'll
[2:27:48] never do this. You'll never do that."
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; But sometimes Abraham has to separate
[2:27:54] himself from Lot.
[2:27:56] &gt;&gt; Sometimes children of the promise.
[2:27:59] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[2:28:01] &gt;&gt; Sometimes children of the promise.
[2:28:04] If I get it all out tonight, you won't
[2:28:06] have to hear from me this week.
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother.
[2:28:12] Sometimes you got to you got to separate
[2:28:14] yourself from the frustrators of
[2:28:15] purpose. Those who don't understand your
[2:28:17] vision, they don't understand your
[2:28:19] calling. They don't understand what
[2:28:21] God's trying to do in your life. You how
[2:28:23] could they? You don't even fully
[2:28:24] understand it.
[2:28:25] &gt;&gt; You just know you got to obey.
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:28] &gt;&gt; You just know you have to keep being
[2:28:29] obedient. Yes.
[2:28:31] &gt;&gt; I know that people like to think that
[2:28:33] brother Brandham live le led this
[2:28:34] strange life simply because of his
[2:28:36] calling. And I want you to know that's
[2:28:38] absolutely true. But there are people in
[2:28:40] this room they don't have that calling.
[2:28:44] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand that I
[2:28:46] understand that he didn't need anyone to
[2:28:48] take his place.
[2:28:50] &gt;&gt; And nobody has that same calling that he
[2:28:53] had. But they've kind of taken that and
[2:28:56] slung it around a little bit and made
[2:28:58] people think that what you're doing,
[2:28:59] what God called you to do, has no value.
[2:29:01] I want you to know the purpose of your
[2:29:03] life is extremely valuable in the in the
[2:29:06] currency of the kingdom of God.
[2:29:09] &gt;&gt; You you may feel like a pew warmer, but
[2:29:11] that but but be a faithful one until God
[2:29:13] opens up something else for you.
[2:29:15] &gt;&gt; But but it's all right for you to
[2:29:16] embrace the call that you've got. It's
[2:29:18] all right for you to understand there's
[2:29:20] a heavy price to pay to be used of God.
[2:29:23] Amen.
[2:29:25] &gt;&gt; It's all right for you to understand
[2:29:26] that sometime you got to pack up your
[2:29:28] stuff.
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:29:34] &gt;&gt; And get out.
[2:29:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; Is not where you belong.
[2:29:42] &gt;&gt; Haron is not where you were born to be.
[2:29:46] &gt;&gt; Sometime you got to get out. Amen.
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; And Abraham realized, Abram realized, I
[2:29:53] got to get out. He thought he could take
[2:29:54] Lot all the way. Listen, you may love
[2:29:56] somebody.
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; You may cherish somebody. They may be
[2:30:01] valuable to you. It may be your greatest
[2:30:03] desire to take them all the way. You may
[2:30:06] hook your arm in their arm and try to
[2:30:09] drag them all the way up to the top of
[2:30:10] Mount Zion.
[2:30:13] But I want you to know there may come a
[2:30:15] day that you realize
[2:30:18] that you'll never get up there by
[2:30:20] yourself.
[2:30:21] &gt;&gt; You'll never get up there dragging
[2:30:23] somebody else.
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; You'll only get up there by depending
[2:30:26] heavily on the Lord.
[2:30:29] &gt;&gt; And letting everybody else do the climb.
[2:30:33] &gt;&gt; There are no shortcuts.
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; There are there are no discharges
[2:30:40] &gt;&gt; in this army of the Lord. Amen.
[2:30:42] &gt;&gt; We're going to fight till the end.
[2:30:44] &gt;&gt; Anybody willing to fight?
[2:30:46] &gt;&gt; Why? You won't even be baptized in the
[2:30:48] name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:30:50] &gt;&gt; And you're going to fight.
[2:30:55] &gt;&gt; No, you're not.
[2:30:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:30:57] &gt;&gt; You won't even marry him in Christian
[2:30:59] baptism.
[2:31:01] &gt;&gt; So afraid of what mama might say or
[2:31:03] daddy might say or or neighbor might say
[2:31:06] or church member over across the road
[2:31:09] might say.
[2:31:13] You better run to the water.
[2:31:16] &gt;&gt; You better wear that name of Jesus
[2:31:18] Christ and wear it like a badge of
[2:31:20] honor.
[2:31:24] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I'm willing to fight."
[2:31:25] You won't even wash your face.
[2:31:32] &gt;&gt; You started with a little cover stick.
[2:31:35] You started with a spray on.
[2:31:42] And now you hang out on that aisle.
[2:31:46] No, you won't fight.
[2:31:49] You haven't even begun to fight.
[2:31:52] You make up your mind today. I'm going
[2:31:55] to fight.
[2:31:57] &gt;&gt; I'm going all the way with this word.
[2:32:01] &gt;&gt; If I'm the only one in my church, here
[2:32:03] here is the difference between the bride
[2:32:05] and somebody in the church. Somebody in
[2:32:06] the church says, "Well, my she does it."
[2:32:09] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; That's a church member.
[2:32:11] &gt;&gt; They're a dime a dozen.
[2:32:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, he does it.
[2:32:15] &gt;&gt; His children do it.
[2:32:19] &gt;&gt; We sound like denominational people,
[2:32:21] don't we?
[2:32:23] &gt;&gt; The bride don't even talk like that. She
[2:32:24] don't reason like that.
[2:32:27] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no. She's hanging out
[2:32:28] with the word. If I'm the only one,
[2:32:31] &gt;&gt; if I'm the only one,
[2:32:34] &gt;&gt; if my husband is the only one, if my
[2:32:36] children are the only ones, we don't
[2:32:39] come to church to do like everybody
[2:32:41] else. We come to fight
[2:32:46] &gt;&gt; because at the end of this war, I'm
[2:32:50] going to have a cup.
[2:32:58] Amen.
[2:32:59] given to me by the king.
[2:33:03] He went on a little further. Lot backs
[2:33:05] slid. You know what happened? Separated
[2:33:06] himself from him. Then God appeared to
[2:33:08] him again. And now Abraham took all over
[2:33:10] the ground. It's all yours. When he made
[2:33:13] the right choice, that's all. Separate
[2:33:16] yourself from everything. And so Genesis
[2:33:18] 13:11 through13, Lot chose the plain of
[2:33:21] the Jordan. You know that. Journeyed
[2:33:23] east. Just flash it up there. Separated
[2:33:25] himself. But verse 13, Abraham, look at
[2:33:28] verse 12. Abram dwelt in the land of
[2:33:29] Canaan. Lot dwelt in the cities of the
[2:33:31] plain. And here's what he did. He didn't
[2:33:33] move to Sodom all all at once.
[2:33:36] &gt;&gt; He just pitched his tent,
[2:33:39] &gt;&gt; inch by inch.
[2:33:46] &gt;&gt; When you turn when you turn your head,
[2:33:48] your focus, your attention
[2:33:51] toward the fantasy
[2:33:53] &gt;&gt; that they pedal down there in Sodom,
[2:33:56] You've already made a decision.
[2:33:59] &gt;&gt; You're thinking, "I'm going to make a
[2:34:00] decision one of these." You've already
[2:34:01] made a decision when you started inching
[2:34:03] your way.
[2:34:04] &gt;&gt; Is that what is that the word? Am I
[2:34:06] ugly? Am I mean, are you getting quiet
[2:34:09] because I'm too mean?
[2:34:13] &gt;&gt; Just Just you know, here's what people
[2:34:14] do. They just back up against each
[2:34:16] other.
[2:34:16] &gt;&gt; They do.
[2:34:21] &gt;&gt; See how close they can get to the edge
[2:34:24] &gt;&gt; and still get by. Come on.
[2:34:26] &gt;&gt; Just see how tight they can wear it
[2:34:29] &gt;&gt; and still move.
[2:34:33] &gt;&gt; I know why you won't pin it.
[2:34:36] If you pinned it, you couldn't walk. Cuz
[2:34:39] it ain't big enough in the first place.
[2:34:43] &gt;&gt; You ain't a mannequin. You're a person.
[2:34:48] &gt;&gt; You've got bends and curves. And
[2:34:51] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[2:34:53] Now,
[2:34:54] &gt;&gt; I'm an expert on curves.
[2:34:58] I know what I'm talking about.
[2:35:01] I know what's I know what stands between
[2:35:03] me and my knees.
[2:35:06] And I know how to get a bigger size.
[2:35:10] &gt;&gt; Just inching just inch in your way. Just
[2:35:13] inch in your way. You outgrow it before
[2:35:16] you know it. That's one thing.
[2:35:18] Four or five years later,
[2:35:22] you're still squeezing in what won't
[2:35:24] fit, won't do, not even considering the
[2:35:27] fact you're all hanging out.
[2:35:31] You're just putting your hip out there
[2:35:32] towards Sodom.
[2:35:35] &gt;&gt; I remember. I remember when they
[2:35:37] preached it like this. I remember when
[2:35:39] the message preachers preached it like
[2:35:41] this. I remember when they preached
[2:35:43] holiness. I remember when they preached
[2:35:46] against the holidays. I remember when
[2:35:48] they preached against the television. I
[2:35:50] remember
[2:35:53] &gt;&gt; now
[2:35:53] &gt;&gt; against the playing cards, against the
[2:35:55] dice in the home.
[2:35:58] &gt;&gt; All substantiated by quotes.
[2:36:02] &gt;&gt; And now we're all there. We're all
[2:36:04] there. Listen to them now. We're all
[2:36:05] there. We know all there is to know
[2:36:07] about the seven seal. We know all there
[2:36:09] is to know about the tent. We know all
[2:36:11] there is to know about the seven
[2:36:12] thunders. And we're in the midst of the
[2:36:14] greatest revival there's ever been in
[2:36:16] the world. Then why have you got one
[2:36:19] foot in Sodom?
[2:36:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:23] &gt;&gt; And a pinky toe in the word.
[2:36:30] &gt;&gt; Make a clip out of that one and then let
[2:36:33] me give you my email list and show you
[2:36:35] where it needs to go. Send that one
[2:36:37] around. People used to dip their toe in
[2:36:40] the world. Now they put theirelves in
[2:36:42] the world and hang a little bit over in
[2:36:45] the church. Don't don't preach anything
[2:36:47] that'll make us feel uh convicted in any
[2:36:50] shape, form or fashion.
[2:36:51] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:36:53] &gt;&gt; Maybe that's the reason. Paragraph 135,
[2:36:55] same sermon.
[2:36:57] Maybe that's the reason some of Oh. Oh.
[2:37:00] Abraham dwelt in the land of Canaan Lot
[2:37:01] dwelt in the cities of the plain pitches
[2:37:02] tent. But the men of Sodom were wicked
[2:37:05] and sinners before the Lord exceedingly.
[2:37:08] That sounds like an amazing place to
[2:37:09] pack up and move your family,
[2:37:14] &gt;&gt; doesn't it? Amen.
[2:37:17] &gt;&gt; I believe the Lord's calling you to Las
[2:37:19] Vegas.
[2:37:23] &gt;&gt; I have a hard time driving through
[2:37:25] Phoenix City.
[2:37:27] &gt;&gt; I'm certainly I can't hardly make it in
[2:37:30] Walmart. I'm certainly not going to move
[2:37:32] to Sin City.
[2:37:34] &gt;&gt; Maybe that's the reason some of us are
[2:37:35] not getting along so well. We're holding
[2:37:37] on to things that we ought to let go of
[2:37:39] &gt;&gt; in the separation. A little doubt, a
[2:37:41] little wonder, a little skeptic.
[2:37:44] Wonder if it's right. Could this be?
[2:37:47] Could that be? How could it be? Doesn't
[2:37:50] that sound like us sometime? Cut. Look,
[2:37:54] this is a servant of the Lord. Cut loose
[2:37:57] this morning.
[2:38:00] &gt;&gt; 133.
[2:38:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:01] &gt;&gt; 133 on the clock.
[2:38:03] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 12:1. Let us lay aside every
[2:38:05] weight and every sin that does so easily
[2:38:06] beset us a sin. What is that? I'm
[2:38:08] quoting the unbelief that does so easily
[2:38:11] beset us. and let us run with patience.
[2:38:13] A race is set before us, looking under
[2:38:15] Christ, the author and finisher of our
[2:38:16] faith. Now notice Abraham here. Then he
[2:38:18] got in trouble. Lot went down to Sodom
[2:38:20] and Gomorrah.
[2:38:21] &gt;&gt; And you know the rest of the story. I
[2:38:23] got to hurry.
[2:38:25] In Genesis 14:es 1-4, it talks about the
[2:38:29] first international war in the land of
[2:38:31] the Bible.
[2:38:34] There were there were uh some cities on
[2:38:37] the Dead Sea, five of them by by by
[2:38:40] number who had been paying tribute to
[2:38:43] the armies of the North for 12 years. In
[2:38:46] the 13 for protection in the 13th year,
[2:38:49] they said, "Look, we're tired of
[2:38:50] shipping all of our money to the north.
[2:38:52] We're just not going to do it anymore."
[2:38:54] So, there was a four king coalition from
[2:38:56] the east
[2:38:58] who decided that I would go through all
[2:39:00] their names if we had the time. why they
[2:39:02] even put them in here. I knew I wouldn't
[2:39:04] get to it. But anyway, those four kings
[2:39:06] said, "We're going to go down and we're
[2:39:08] going to shake a knot in them and
[2:39:10] they're going to pay their tribute like
[2:39:12] they've done for the past 12 years." You
[2:39:15] understand so far? So these eastern
[2:39:17] kings, they're not on a raid. They're
[2:39:20] not just going trying to take something
[2:39:21] from somebody. They're going there to
[2:39:23] reimpart imperial control over the trade
[2:39:26] corridors,
[2:39:28] major trade corridors of the land of
[2:39:31] what we now call Israel and all of the
[2:39:35] most valuable resources around the Dead
[2:39:38] Sea region. They're going to go back and
[2:39:40] take control. So this coalition makes a
[2:39:44] sweeping raid down that TransJordan
[2:39:47] Valley all the way through Sier and El
[2:39:50] Pon and then back up to Kadesh
[2:39:54] and to Hazison Teamar. The five
[2:39:58] Canaanite kings meet them in the valley
[2:40:00] of Sadim. The valley of Sadeem is at the
[2:40:04] is at the Dead Sea. The Valley of Sadim
[2:40:07] is known for its slime pits. Anybody
[2:40:10] know what that is?
[2:40:11] &gt;&gt; Dangerous.
[2:40:13] &gt;&gt; It's like quicksand.
[2:40:16] &gt;&gt; It's what they make brick. It's what
[2:40:18] they build cities out of. It has
[2:40:21] multiple uses. It's like tar. It is
[2:40:24] exactly like aphalt.
[2:40:27] We call it asphalt. My wife Canadian
[2:40:30] eastern, she calls it ash fault.
[2:40:32] Whatever you call it, it's black.
[2:40:35] Especially when it's been painted black
[2:40:37] like ours.
[2:40:39] And it is, that's what this is. It's
[2:40:41] it's a natural form. Comes right out of
[2:40:43] the ground. It'll seal anything. It's a
[2:40:46] valuable asset. And they're they're
[2:40:49] fighting. Those Canaanite kings said,
[2:40:50] "Hey, we can't we can't just let them
[2:40:52] come in there, take this. We got to make
[2:40:54] a little bit for ourselves." And and so
[2:40:56] forth. And so the next thing you know,
[2:40:58] they come all the way down there and
[2:40:59] they take captives and they start taking
[2:41:01] prisoners and they start taking spoils
[2:41:04] with them. And guess what part of the
[2:41:06] spoils they take? They take Lot. Yes.
[2:41:09] &gt;&gt; Well, they wouldn't have took Lot if he
[2:41:10] hadn't been there.
[2:41:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, he didn't mean to get shot.
[2:41:18] He was just in the bar. He He was just
[2:41:20] in the bar.
[2:41:25] He He didn't mean to to break his leg on
[2:41:29] the dance floor. Well, he was just in
[2:41:31] there. He He was just just relaxing,
[2:41:34] just chilling.
[2:41:41] Why? He He He He didn't mean to get
[2:41:43] shot. He He was just picking up a little
[2:41:47] drug. Just just just just
[2:41:50] little little dime bag,
[2:41:53] just handful of pills.
[2:41:56] Don't know what to call them because
[2:41:57] they didn't have no prescription. Just
[2:42:00] they might they might make you feel
[2:42:01] better. They might kill you. But he did,
[2:42:04] you know, he was just looking to relax.
[2:42:08] Folks, he ought not been down. He ought
[2:42:10] not to have been down there uh in in in
[2:42:12] the in the ghetto looking for something
[2:42:14] to to to lift him. He ought not been at
[2:42:17] the bar looking to play a game of pool
[2:42:20] to relax. There's just some places
[2:42:23] Sodom, if Lot would have not been in
[2:42:26] Sodom, it says the men of Sodom were
[2:42:27] more wicked than the rest of the plates.
[2:42:30] If he hadn't have been down there,
[2:42:31] pitched his tent till he finally moved
[2:42:33] in. Come on.
[2:42:34] &gt;&gt; We know something was wrong with the man
[2:42:37] &gt;&gt; because when the angels did finally come
[2:42:39] to get him out
[2:42:42] &gt;&gt; the men, the homosexuals of the city
[2:42:44] come and try to rape and molest the
[2:42:46] angels. And what does brilliant Lot do?
[2:42:51] &gt;&gt; Be careful how you criticize him
[2:42:57] &gt;&gt; because you sit down in front of filth
[2:42:59] with your daughters.
[2:43:00] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:43:03] Amen.
[2:43:04] &gt;&gt; Aren't you Aren't you Aren't you on
[2:43:05] dangerous territory?
[2:43:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:43:12] &gt;&gt; He says to the to the men of the city,
[2:43:14] "Just hold right on. I I know you'd
[2:43:16] rather have the male angels, but would
[2:43:18] you take my daughters?
[2:43:20] Just do with them as you." Something's
[2:43:22] wrong with this man. This man had no
[2:43:25] business. That's
[2:43:26] &gt;&gt; right.
[2:43:29] &gt;&gt; And so they take him away. He's
[2:43:31] kidnapped,
[2:43:33] stolen away, and one of the kings of
[2:43:36] Sodom started to run. Brother Brandham
[2:43:38] tells us in paragraph 140, just flash it
[2:43:40] up there. I can't read it, but but he
[2:43:42] starts to run and he and he fell in the
[2:43:44] slime. That's that's 142. I want 140. Uh
[2:43:47] he fell in the slime flats
[2:43:50] and died.
[2:43:53] And he said slime is what they make
[2:43:55] their bricks and mortar. In Genesis 14
[2:43:57] through17, hurry. Uh he said, "And when
[2:44:00] Abram heard that his brother was taken
[2:44:02] captive, it wasn't his brother. It was
[2:44:04] his nephew. But brother was a term of
[2:44:06] endearment." And listen what brother
[2:44:07] Bram said in paragraph 142, "Brother,
[2:44:09] brother." I like that. His brother. And
[2:44:11] look what the Lord had done to him. But
[2:44:13] yet there was some kind of tithe that
[2:44:14] binds. Listen. If the brother has
[2:44:17] backslid, like the young man said a
[2:44:19] while ago, the young minister here that
[2:44:20] he backslid and gone away, yet somehow
[2:44:22] the Holy Spirit still calls.
[2:44:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:44:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. for that person when he's in
[2:44:28] trouble, he's right there with him.
[2:44:30] Aren't you glad that there's a Holy
[2:44:33] Spirit that'll chase you like a hound of
[2:44:36] hell
[2:44:38] &gt;&gt; and try to woo you and pull you back to
[2:44:42] true repentance.
[2:44:44] &gt;&gt; He was as backslid as he ever could have
[2:44:46] been. And yet Abraham called him
[2:44:48] brother. And when he heard his brother
[2:44:49] had been taken, he got down to business
[2:44:52] then. And he and he starts going after
[2:44:54] him. And they went all the way to Dan,
[2:44:56] which is about 150 to 170 miles from
[2:45:00] from Sodom to Dan. And when they got to
[2:45:03] Dan, he was already gone again. You
[2:45:04] remember he was already gone. He was no
[2:45:07] longer at the gates of Dan. And so he
[2:45:09] went all the way up into what we now
[2:45:11] call Lebanon,
[2:45:13] at least another hundred miles.
[2:45:16] He's not on in his Maserati.
[2:45:21] &gt;&gt; He's on a camel. He's not in his private
[2:45:24] jet.
[2:45:26] He's walking and riding on a bumpy path.
[2:45:31] Now nearly 300 miles looking for where
[2:45:35] Lot and his family have been sold.
[2:45:40] And God gives him victory. I wished I
[2:45:42] could tell you about it, but I can't.
[2:45:46] Read it.
[2:45:48] God give him victory.
[2:45:51] This rag tag group. Let me just get this
[2:45:54] in. Do I have Yeah. Yeah. I got 20
[2:45:55] minutes. I'm taking them.
[2:45:57] &gt;&gt; I'm taking them.
[2:45:59] &gt;&gt; I'm taking them if it hair lifts the
[2:46:00] devil and bankrupts hell. And I don't
[2:46:02] care whether you wash my feet or not. I
[2:46:04] already washed them this morning.
[2:46:10] I just want you to know this is like
[2:46:12] this is serious business to me. I I I
[2:46:15] don't have any way of telling you what
[2:46:17] it's been like. And I'm ready for a
[2:46:19] little of it to be off of my shoulders.
[2:46:22] &gt;&gt; I I I I've got to I've got to I've got
[2:46:25] to live too. And I've got to move. I've
[2:46:28] got to I've got to have a little bit of
[2:46:29] relief. And I'm trying to get it off of
[2:46:31] me so that I can have a little bit of
[2:46:32] relief. And no, I'm nothing. I'm I'm I'm
[2:46:35] nothing great.
[2:46:37] &gt;&gt; If I was, I could say this to you in 20
[2:46:40] minutes and you'd run and get it all
[2:46:42] made right. I struggle because I'm
[2:46:45] nothing and because I only can depend on
[2:46:48] him and because I spend way more time
[2:46:51] studying and I make way more notes than
[2:46:54] I ever would need because I had rather
[2:46:57] be overly prepared
[2:47:00] &gt;&gt; than have nothing to say but a parrot's
[2:47:04] message.
[2:47:10] &gt;&gt; And he win. They win. They win. They
[2:47:13] divide themselves by night. Verse 15, he
[2:47:15] divided himself. He and his servants,
[2:47:18] which is bond servants, which are
[2:47:20] indentured servants by night and smoke
[2:47:23] them and pursued them. And did you know
[2:47:24] the Bible tells us that exactly how
[2:47:27] many? 318
[2:47:29] servants
[2:47:31] become an army
[2:47:34] that defeats five kingdoms.
[2:47:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:40] &gt;&gt; 318 men. Come on.
[2:47:43] &gt;&gt; Defeat five of the largest kingdoms
[2:47:47] known to man at the time. And Abraham
[2:47:50] says, "You're mine." And he grabs Lot
[2:47:53] and he takes the spoils. And the king of
[2:47:56] Sodom says, "I'll give you everything.
[2:47:58] You can have it all. You can have it
[2:48:00] all." And Abraham has to come back
[2:48:02] later, Abram, excuse me, has to come
[2:48:03] back later and tell him, "I don't want
[2:48:05] none of your stuff. I didn't come to get
[2:48:07] the stuff. I came to get my lot. I came
[2:48:09] to get my nephew. I came to get my loved
[2:48:11] ones.
[2:48:13] &gt;&gt; I don't want your gold. I want my loved
[2:48:16] ones out.
[2:48:19] [Applause]
[2:48:22] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm here.
[2:48:24] &gt;&gt; That's why you're here.
[2:48:25] &gt;&gt; We want our loved ones snatched out of
[2:48:28] the clutches of the house of hell.
[2:48:33] &gt;&gt; Are you screaming? I hope I am.
[2:48:35] &gt;&gt; Come on. cuz if I'm not, I need to turn
[2:48:37] it up and scream a little louder.
[2:48:41] &gt;&gt; God used 318, a compact mobile strike
[2:48:44] force and a and a 75 plus year old man
[2:48:48] named Abram who hadn't even began to get
[2:48:51] his promises yet.
[2:48:56] &gt;&gt; He's got a lot more benefits and
[2:48:59] blessings coming. But they recover. They
[2:49:02] recover all. They they get the plunder.
[2:49:04] They get lot They get lots of goods.
[2:49:05] They get the women and the people and
[2:49:06] and the non-combatants and just take
[2:49:09] them all. Just go. And the king of Sodom
[2:49:12] runs out there in verse 17 and offers
[2:49:14] him everything he wants. But here's
[2:49:15] where I want you to go. I want you to go
[2:49:17] to verse 18 through 20 quickly. And
[2:49:19] Melzdc, king of Salem, brought forth
[2:49:21] bread. What did he bring forth?
[2:49:23] &gt;&gt; What did Melazdc What did Melzdc bring?
[2:49:27] &gt;&gt; Bread and wine. What did he bring?
[2:49:29] &gt;&gt; Bread and wine.
[2:49:31] &gt;&gt; He brought bread and wine.
[2:49:35] I love it. And he was who? He was the
[2:49:40] priest of the most high God. He was
[2:49:43] actually a forerunner of an end time
[2:49:46] bride because he was not only priest,
[2:49:50] he was also king.
[2:49:52] &gt;&gt; And the Bible speaks of the overcomers
[2:49:55] that they will also function as both
[2:49:58] priests and kings.
[2:50:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[2:50:02] &gt;&gt; He represents a priesthood that's above
[2:50:04] the ironic priesthood
[2:50:06] &gt;&gt; that would later follow.
[2:50:08] &gt;&gt; In fact, this priesthood of Melzdc is an
[2:50:11] eternal one.
[2:50:12] &gt;&gt; The scripture tells us that will never
[2:50:14] pass away. Hey, there's something going
[2:50:15] on with this MelzDC, isn't there?
[2:50:18] &gt;&gt; All right. He brought bread and wine.
[2:50:19] What did he bring?
[2:50:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said he brought communion.
[2:50:24] &gt;&gt; He brought the Lord's supper.
[2:50:26] &gt;&gt; But there hadn't been a Lord's supper.
[2:50:29] And there hadn't been a Passover,
[2:50:33] but there was tithe paying
[2:50:36] &gt;&gt; and communion.
[2:50:38] &gt;&gt; Before there was a law,
[2:50:41] &gt;&gt; before there was instructional
[2:50:46] &gt;&gt; and he blessed him. He blessed him. And
[2:50:48] and and blessed be Abram of the most
[2:50:50] high God, possessor of heaven and earth.
[2:50:53] And blessed be the most high God. Are
[2:50:55] you still here?
[2:50:56] Blessed be the most high God which hath
[2:50:58] delivered thine enemies into thy hand.
[2:51:00] And he gave them tithes of all. The word
[2:51:02] melik for for mezazedc.
[2:51:06] You can say it any kind of way. Just
[2:51:08] brother Brandham did and you can too.
[2:51:11] Don't even matter how you say it. Don't
[2:51:14] even struggle to say Mphibicheth. Just
[2:51:16] say however you call him Mickey if you
[2:51:18] need to. Whatever you need to do. If you
[2:51:20] can't say it, you can still get what it
[2:51:23] means.
[2:51:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[2:51:25] &gt;&gt; Melik means king. Melik hahaam, king of
[2:51:27] the whole universe. Melik is king. And
[2:51:30] Zedic
[2:51:32] where we get Melzdc
[2:51:34] de K sometimes spelled with a C is
[2:51:38] Zadicc.
[2:51:40] Zedek is righteous.
[2:51:42] Righteousness.
[2:51:44] Zadec comes from Zadok.
[2:51:47] There is a Levitical priesthood. There
[2:51:50] is a Zadok priesthood. There is a Melzdc
[2:51:55] priesthood all mentioned in the Bible.
[2:51:58] The Zadok priesthood operated under a
[2:52:01] special kind of an anointing and they
[2:52:04] were able to discern
[2:52:08] between the holy
[2:52:10] &gt;&gt; the profane
[2:52:11] &gt;&gt; and the profane. Right.
[2:52:13] &gt;&gt; Melzdc was a forerunner
[2:52:16] of a of a priesthood
[2:52:19] that would be available to overcoming
[2:52:21] believers
[2:52:23] who it would grant them by the full
[2:52:26] revelation and unveiling apocalypsis of
[2:52:28] the word. It would grant them the
[2:52:31] ability to discern between the holy and
[2:52:34] profane. Not just by first glance,
[2:52:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:52:38] but by seeing the spirit behind
[2:52:43] the thing.
[2:52:44] &gt;&gt; I want you to follow me just another
[2:52:46] minute or two.
[2:52:48] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it doesn't look as obvious.
[2:52:53] &gt;&gt; I've watched sisters come under spirits
[2:52:55] because they change their hairstyle.
[2:53:02] Nothing wrong with having a different
[2:53:03] hairstyle. You all don't have to be
[2:53:05] Queen Elizabeth and have the same one
[2:53:07] for 70 years.
[2:53:11] But what you don't want to do is let the
[2:53:14] enemy talk you into one
[2:53:17] &gt;&gt; that makes you appear in some
[2:53:18] provocative kind of way
[2:53:21] &gt;&gt; that that attracts like a magnet of
[2:53:23] spirit
[2:53:24] that's going to going to have long-term
[2:53:27] and farreaching effects that Zadok
[2:53:30] priesthood would not just judge by
[2:53:32] outward appearance but they would have a
[2:53:35] an ability to discern the spirit behind.
[2:53:42] I know you're wore out.
[2:53:44] &gt;&gt; You you you ought to be me.
[2:53:50] It's so vitally important. When people
[2:53:53] first come to the word, they say, "Why
[2:53:54] does that matter? Why why can't a woman
[2:53:55] wear the breaches? Why can't Why can't
[2:53:57] she Why is it not a good idea for a
[2:53:59] godly woman to wear pajama britches in
[2:54:01] her in her house?"
[2:54:04] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible didn't say where you
[2:54:06] wear it.
[2:54:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:54:09] The Bible said not to wear that which
[2:54:11] pertainth unto a man.
[2:54:14] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what he said?
[2:54:17] &gt;&gt; Is somebody going to go to hell for
[2:54:18] that? I wouldn't say so. I I don't know.
[2:54:21] Um I don't allow it in my home.
[2:54:25] And And so I don't know. I I can't say.
[2:54:28] But I tell you what I can say. There
[2:54:30] could very easily be a spirit behind
[2:54:32] that.
[2:54:34] &gt;&gt; And the milkman. Nobody has a milkman,
[2:54:36] do they? Well, you some of you kind of
[2:54:38] do, but you go get your own milk. But if
[2:54:40] you if the milkman comes to the door,
[2:54:44] the next thing you know, you just run
[2:54:46] out there.
[2:54:48] There was a time you would have put on a
[2:54:50] robe, but you got the you're covered up.
[2:54:52] You got on these pajama bottoms and
[2:54:54] pants and and you run out there to the
[2:54:56] milkman and to the door and get your
[2:54:58] milk. You stand right there dressed like
[2:55:00] a man pertaining to a man. Don't shout
[2:55:04] me down.
[2:55:06] Now go ahead, preach.
[2:55:07] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "How do pajama pants
[2:55:09] pertain to a man?" "How do blue jeans
[2:55:10] pertain to a man?" "How do slacks in
[2:55:12] general pertain to a man?"
[2:55:15] &gt;&gt; Big subject here, isn't it?
[2:55:19] We could talk about the crotch for one
[2:55:20] thing. We could talk about the division
[2:55:23] of the uh of the material for one thing,
[2:55:26] but then we'd have to get on some of the
[2:55:28] other popular things around the message
[2:55:33] that at one time they used to wear them
[2:55:35] under their clothes and now they're
[2:55:37] getting bolder and bolder and bolder and
[2:55:40] they're underneath the things they said
[2:55:41] were only wearing for underneath
[2:55:43] purposes. Let's see. Watch how quiet it
[2:55:45] gets. That's right.
[2:55:47] &gt;&gt; We're only wearing this for
[2:55:48] undergarments and it's none nobody's
[2:55:49] business because they're under our
[2:55:50] clothes. Even though they're like a man,
[2:55:52] even though they definitely would
[2:55:53] pertain to a man, we're wearing them
[2:55:55] under our clothes so nobody cares. And
[2:55:56] the next thing you know, they start
[2:55:57] getting longer.
[2:56:00] &gt;&gt; Watch how quiet they'll get.
[2:56:04] &gt;&gt; And this and of course the skirt gets
[2:56:06] shorter because there's no no need
[2:56:08] because you've got something else to
[2:56:09] kind of protect. So the skirt comes like
[2:56:12] this.
[2:56:14] &gt;&gt; It don't matter cuz you got these things
[2:56:16] on hanging out down there beneath. And
[2:56:19] and the one thing I know brother
[2:56:20] Brandham said was a woman should not
[2:56:22] show her underneath garment.
[2:56:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:56:24] &gt;&gt; And if you're wearing that for modesty,
[2:56:27] it is an underneath garment and it
[2:56:28] should stay underneath.
[2:56:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:56:32] &gt;&gt; Because the scripture said pertain.
[2:56:34] &gt;&gt; Now you're just preaching your
[2:56:36] conviction.
[2:56:39] Maybe I'm preaching that there's a
[2:56:42] spirit,
[2:56:44] &gt;&gt; an influence
[2:56:46] behind some of the compromising things
[2:56:49] that the church keeps adopting.
[2:56:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:56:52] &gt;&gt; And I wonder where it's going to lead
[2:56:54] us.
[2:57:00] I know where
[2:57:02] we're going to put our hip and our leg
[2:57:04] and we're going to inch over until the
[2:57:06] next thing we know we get caught up in a
[2:57:08] war that's not ours.
[2:57:10] &gt;&gt; Lot didn't even have any skin in the
[2:57:12] fight.
[2:57:13] &gt;&gt; But he he ends up being a captive and
[2:57:15] hauled off as a prisoner.
[2:57:17] &gt;&gt; And he could care less what what Sodom
[2:57:19] He just liked it because there was a big
[2:57:21] shopping mall. His wife liked it because
[2:57:23] there were beauty parlors.
[2:57:26] It it it just seemed like a nice place
[2:57:27] to hang out.
[2:57:29] &gt;&gt; And now he becomes a prisoner and hung
[2:57:31] up. And his old fogy uh uncle Abram
[2:57:37] &gt;&gt; who said, "You got to go your way and
[2:57:38] I'll go mine." But he wasn't going to
[2:57:41] cheat him. So he took him on the
[2:57:42] mountain. You look out. You take the
[2:57:44] best. You take the price, the pricey,
[2:57:46] the most valuable. You take whatever
[2:57:48] land you want and I'll take the rest.
[2:57:51] &gt;&gt; What a spirit. What an unselfish spirit
[2:57:54] he had.
[2:57:56] &gt;&gt; And now this same one said, "My
[2:57:57] brother's been taken. I've got to leave
[2:57:59] everything. I've got to go find him all
[2:58:01] the way to Dan all the way up to
[2:58:03] Damascus or wherever he was going."
[2:58:07] There's something about this Melzdc.
[2:58:09] He's the king of righteousness. He's the
[2:58:11] king. 153. No, I didn't fall. Um, there
[2:58:15] are many might would like that, but I
[2:58:17] didn't fall.
[2:58:20] Did not fall. I'm okay. I know it's a
[2:58:22] loud environment. I live in one. I
[2:58:24] understand now that that's settled. King
[2:58:27] of King of Zedic, King of righteousness,
[2:58:30] King of King of Salem, Salem,
[2:58:34] which is where I live. Thank the Lord. I
[2:58:38] live in Salem, Alabama. And I have an
[2:58:40] apartment in Jerusalem,
[2:58:44] Israel. Both meaning peace. I love that.
[2:58:48] I like that.
[2:58:50] &gt;&gt; This Melzdc wasn't an ordinary priest.
[2:58:52] He wasn't an ordinary king. Flash this
[2:58:54] up and we'll stop. We got to get to a
[2:58:56] point in a minute. We're nearly done.
[2:59:01] I can't even get you to laugh with me
[2:59:02] now. Can't get you to smile. Can't get
[2:59:04] you nod your head. I've offended you and
[2:59:07] I've drugged you out and I've wore you
[2:59:09] out and good. You're going to be too
[2:59:11] tired to come and take communion. So,
[2:59:12] it'll be a quick short service for the
[2:59:14] few that show up. Let Let me just read
[2:59:17] you. I don't have time to read these
[2:59:18] quotes, but but I I just knew that I
[2:59:20] wouldn't. So, I summarize them. Please
[2:59:22] don't think that this is something I I I
[2:59:24] feel like I'm uh you know um editing the
[2:59:28] quotes. I'm not. I just took out the
[2:59:30] main points because he says so many
[2:59:33] thing about MelzDC. So many things. I
[2:59:35] want to make sure you know who he is.
[2:59:36] Can you flash those up? This comes from
[2:59:38] paragraph 634 of Hebrews chapter 6
[2:59:40] series. He said, uh here's some of the
[2:59:43] things Brother Bram taught us about. He
[2:59:45] wasn't born. He was just created.
[2:59:48] &gt;&gt; He was a body that he dwelt in.
[2:59:51] &gt;&gt; Jesus had a beginning of days and an
[2:59:53] ending of life. Jesus had both father
[2:59:57] and mother. This is according to
[2:59:58] paragraph 634. But Jesus
[3:00:01] was made after the order of Melzdc. Do
[3:00:07] you see that?
[3:00:09] &gt;&gt; All right. The next paragraph, brother
[3:00:11] Bam tells us Melzdc was God himself,
[3:00:15] &gt;&gt; not a natural man,
[3:00:17] &gt;&gt; not a man born of a woman, not a man
[3:00:20] born at all. He was God himself. He said
[3:00:24] Melzdc was Jehovah God, the same one
[3:00:29] that made Abraham that met Abraham years
[3:00:31] later in front of his tent.
[3:00:34] &gt;&gt; You see, he wasn't just an ordinary
[3:00:36] priest or king. Paragraph 639. He was
[3:00:39] never born. Melzdc. He will never die.
[3:00:42] Melzdc. It was God. Sure. In the
[3:00:46] foreshadow
[3:00:48] in the foreshadow of the Lord Jesus. Do
[3:00:51] you follow that? But Jesus had to come
[3:00:54] through a woman.
[3:00:56] &gt;&gt; He had to come the way that you come.
[3:01:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:01:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, I like it. Through a woman in order
[3:01:04] to bring you back to him. Amen.
[3:01:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, I like it, sir.
[3:01:11] &gt;&gt; I like that. Uh, I think I skipped 635.
[3:01:15] Did I? No. Nope. I got it. All right.
[3:01:18] Never born, never die. All right. Let's
[3:01:21] go to the next one. Uh, Melzd when
[3:01:23] Melzdc was on earth, he was Jehovah God
[3:01:27] made manifest by creation. He was here.
[3:01:30] But like in a theophony,
[3:01:34] which is a body created to contain
[3:01:36] deity, a theophony, some sometimes
[3:01:40] called a christophony, which is a
[3:01:42] prefigure or a foreshadow of Christ
[3:01:44] himself, which we could say about
[3:01:46] Melzdc. Theophony is fine, but he would
[3:01:50] have also been Christophan. And in
[3:01:53] paragraph 306, he was not Jesus.
[3:01:58] Oh, this oh this is so good. This this
[3:02:01] this message uh he where he's talking in
[3:02:05] Hebrews uh chapter 7 number two. This is
[3:02:08] rich. He was not Jesus for he was God.
[3:02:15] &gt;&gt; Let's confuse the trinitarians.
[3:02:18] But before we're done, let's confuse the
[3:02:20] oneness.
[3:02:23] He was not Jesus for he was God. Jesus,
[3:02:27] this is beautifully done. Jesus was the
[3:02:29] tabernacle
[3:02:31] that God dwelt in.
[3:02:33] &gt;&gt; Therefore, Melzdc was not Jesus.
[3:02:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:02:39] &gt;&gt; Just think about it. Let it sink in.
[3:02:41] Chew it. Wrong wrong. Chew it up.
[3:02:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the tabernacle that God dwelt
[3:02:47] in. Jesus as a son had a beginning of
[3:02:50] life. There's no eternal sunship in the
[3:02:54] revelation of Jesus Christ message. No
[3:02:56] eternal sunship. So Jesus as a son had a
[3:02:59] beginning of life. Jesus couldn't be
[3:03:01] Melzdc. Melzdc couldn't be Jesus.
[3:03:04] &gt;&gt; Because Jesus had a beginning of life.
[3:03:07] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[3:03:09] &gt;&gt; There's no eternal sunship. Melzdc,
[3:03:11] watch this.
[3:03:14] [Music]
[3:03:15] &gt;&gt; Melzdc and Jesus were one. Amen.
[3:03:19] &gt;&gt; Melzdc could not be Jesus. I love this.
[3:03:22] It all makes sense. And that's what
[3:03:24] scares me.
[3:03:27] &gt;&gt; It makes spiritual sense to me. I I
[3:03:30] bought that book. I bought that book of
[3:03:32] of all the uh heresy teachings of
[3:03:34] William Brandham. I bought that book
[3:03:37] uh that they use to to beat people and
[3:03:40] pull them and scare them out of the
[3:03:41] truth. And I read it. I think I
[3:03:43] mentioned this because Sister Shosana
[3:03:45] asked me what did what was in there. And
[3:03:47] I thought, boy, I got to read this
[3:03:49] because there's going to be some things
[3:03:50] in here that's going to shake me. I
[3:03:52] mean, I know I I know if it if this
[3:03:54] causes people to run, I better read this
[3:03:56] book. I I opened it up and I and I read
[3:03:59] one paragraph. I said, "Oh, yes.
[3:04:01] Hallelujah. Thank God. I believe that."
[3:04:05] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[3:04:07] &gt;&gt; So, I said, "Let me turn. Let me scoop
[3:04:08] over here. I believe that with all my
[3:04:10] heart. I got more persuaded the more I
[3:04:14] read, the more I shouted.
[3:04:16] &gt;&gt; And all I could say is, "I'm one of
[3:04:18] them. I'm one of them. I'm one of them.
[3:04:20] I'm one of them."
[3:04:22] &gt;&gt; Because I get this. I get this because
[3:04:25] it's been quickened. He was not Jesus
[3:04:27] for he was God. Jesus was the tabernacle
[3:04:29] that God dwelt in. Jesus as a son had a
[3:04:32] beginning of life, but it was the
[3:04:33] self-same person. Melzdc and Jesus were
[3:04:36] one, but they're not the same.
[3:04:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:04:41] Well, isn't that the same of the
[3:04:42] Godhead? Father and father and Jesus.
[3:04:44] &gt;&gt; Aren't they one? One spirit, one
[3:04:46] essence.
[3:04:48] &gt;&gt; But not the same office or
[3:04:50] manifestation, but the same God. Here, O
[3:04:52] Israel, the Lord. Oh, yeah. Jesus was
[3:04:54] the earthly body. You should hear this.
[3:04:58] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the earthly body born and
[3:05:01] fashioned after sin. God's own body.
[3:05:04] That is the reason he had a beginning
[3:05:07] because his body
[3:05:11] was a body of flesh.
[3:05:13] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, this is some kind of
[3:05:15] man. This is some kind of a a and it's
[3:05:18] powerful. Very very powerful. So, let
[3:05:20] let me let me finish with this. It's 2
[3:05:22] o'clock. Woo.
[3:05:27] I hope you hope you packed the lunch.
[3:05:29] You can eat in the car and come on back.
[3:05:32] Paragraph 59. Now, notice Abraham, there
[3:05:34] he was. He met MelzDC. Can I have five?
[3:05:37] Thank you. Five minutes. 10 minutes. Uh,
[3:05:40] anybody give me 10, 15, 12.
[3:05:43] Notice Abraham, there he was. And he met
[3:05:45] Melzdc, which is the king of Salem, king
[3:05:48] of Jerusalem, king of peace, without
[3:05:50] father, without mother. And notice, he
[3:05:51] blessed a Abraham. Listen, he blessed
[3:05:54] Abraham after. Read it. Read it with me.
[3:05:56] After the battle was won. When did when
[3:06:00] did MelzDC meet Abram on the road? After
[3:06:03] the battle was won. When did Melzdc
[3:06:06] bless Abram? After the battle was won.
[3:06:10] When did Melzdc serve bread and wine to
[3:06:13] Abram? After the battle was won.
[3:06:18] &gt;&gt; Woo.
[3:06:20] &gt;&gt; You get it?
[3:06:23] &gt;&gt; Not till the battle's won.
[3:06:26] &gt;&gt; Not till the battle's won.
[3:06:29] I won't eat. I won't drink of this cup
[3:06:33] until the battle's won
[3:06:36] &gt;&gt; and then I'll give it to you in the
[3:06:38] kingdom of my father.
[3:06:40] &gt;&gt; And notice what he did. He brought out
[3:06:42] wine and bread and give it to him. Wine
[3:06:45] and bread is the communion. They took
[3:06:48] communion after the battle
[3:06:53] was over.
[3:06:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "I I despise that
[3:06:56] doctrine of spiritual communion.
[3:07:01] There there were a bunch of nutsis
[3:07:02] around the beginning of the ministry,
[3:07:04] still a few, and they ran around saying,
[3:07:08] "We we won't take communion anymore. We
[3:07:10] we shouldn't take communion anymore." Of
[3:07:11] course, the same folks said we shouldn't
[3:07:14] uh have sexual relations with our wives
[3:07:16] anymore. Well, you know, that didn't
[3:07:18] last because they kept having children.
[3:07:22] But they never did go back to taking
[3:07:24] natural elements of communion.
[3:07:27] There's no such a thing as a as as
[3:07:29] communion becoming spiritual and we
[3:07:31] don't need it anymore because Jesus said
[3:07:34] when the battle's over.
[3:07:38] &gt;&gt; So So sure, one of these days we're
[3:07:40] going to take communion again. Find it.
[3:07:43] Where's that at? Is it in the next?
[3:07:45] There it is. Sure. One of these days
[3:07:47] we're going to take what?
[3:07:51] When
[3:07:55] &gt;&gt; when we brought back the lost sheep, the
[3:07:57] lost children,
[3:07:58] &gt;&gt; the lost sheep of the fold,
[3:08:00] &gt;&gt; Abram went and got Lot,
[3:08:09] &gt;&gt; enlarge thy borders,
[3:08:12] expand thy tent pegs,
[3:08:15] &gt;&gt; stretch yourself.
[3:08:17] I heard the Lord yesterday as clear as I
[3:08:20] have ever heard his voice. I'm walking
[3:08:22] through my house all by myself. I had of
[3:08:25] course been in the word most of the day.
[3:08:27] I'm walking through the house all by
[3:08:29] myself and I heard the Lord say, "Tell
[3:08:32] them they weren't ready for the first
[3:08:34] wave.
[3:08:38] I sent the exiled
[3:08:41] and prisoners of war and they were not
[3:08:44] ready for the first wave.
[3:08:47] But they better be prepared for the next
[3:08:51] wave.
[3:08:54] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "What in the world does
[3:08:55] that mean?" I'll let you in and the Holy
[3:08:56] Ghost to see if you can figure that out.
[3:08:59] But I I get it.
[3:09:03] I get it.
[3:09:10] It ain't easy
[3:09:12] blending communities
[3:09:15] and bringing different streams together.
[3:09:18] It ain't easy.
[3:09:22] But there's some exiles. There's some
[3:09:24] lost ones, too.
[3:09:27] Sometimes the the pieces of the of the
[3:09:29] chess game have to be moved around so
[3:09:32] that the so that the prisoners so so
[3:09:34] that those taken captive can can have a
[3:09:37] place.
[3:09:39] It's in him. It's in Christ. It's not a
[3:09:42] geographical location.
[3:09:45] But God does have a spiritual refuge.
[3:09:50] He gave us this land and told us it
[3:09:52] would be. It would be a refuge.
[3:09:56] I pray it can be.
[3:09:58] I pray that it will be. I pray that we
[3:10:01] can be ready for the next wave
[3:10:04] of prisoners of war. I pray that this
[3:10:07] communion service tonight will make a
[3:10:08] difference.
[3:10:10] &gt;&gt; Sir, one of these days we're going to
[3:10:11] take communion again when the battle's
[3:10:13] over. When we brought back the lost
[3:10:14] children, the lost sheep of the foe,
[3:10:15] have brought them back into
[3:10:17] reconciliation. And isn't that the
[3:10:18] ministry of the bride? Isn't that what
[3:10:19] the scripture tells us? And I'll give
[3:10:21] them the ministry of reconciliation
[3:10:27] &gt;&gt; in so many ways. That's just the
[3:10:29] continuation of the commission that
[3:10:31] Brother Brandham operated in. Turning
[3:10:33] hearts
[3:10:36] &gt;&gt; back to Christ,
[3:10:38] &gt;&gt; fathers, children, children, fathers.
[3:10:40] And you and I, it's our desire to turn
[3:10:43] hearts back to Christ. Amen.
[3:10:46] &gt;&gt; And life is finished. And then we'll
[3:10:48] have communion again with the Melzdc of
[3:10:50] heaven,
[3:10:51] &gt;&gt; Christ.
[3:10:53] He will bring out the bread and the
[3:10:55] wine.
[3:10:58] &gt;&gt; And we'll enjoy it together.
[3:11:01] &gt;&gt; See, it's more than Passover.
[3:11:04] It's about more than Passover. It's even
[3:11:06] about more than the broken body of our
[3:11:08] Lord. It's about even more than just the
[3:11:12] blood,
[3:11:14] the wine that represents the blood. It's
[3:11:16] about even more than that. It prophesies
[3:11:19] of a day that you and I will drink this
[3:11:21] wine with him again in the kingdom. When
[3:11:29] &gt;&gt; When the battle's over.
[3:11:33] &gt;&gt; When the battle's over. Abraham's seed,
[3:11:35] paragraph 46. Musicians are coming. As
[3:11:38] soon as the battle was over,
[3:11:43] what did he bring out? Bread and wine.
[3:11:46] &gt;&gt; Woo!
[3:11:49] When I take my bread and my wine
[3:11:52] tonight, I'm first and foremost I'm
[3:11:55] going to think about the broken body of
[3:11:58] my Lord.
[3:12:02] Brother Brandham said it's wrong to
[3:12:05] believe that communion can save you.
[3:12:08] &gt;&gt; He said communion has nothing to do with
[3:12:11] salvation
[3:12:14] &gt;&gt; because of the doctrine.
[3:12:17] He said it's not about last rights.
[3:12:21] The Catholics rush to the hospital to
[3:12:23] give them the last communion so they can
[3:12:25] be saved, so they can be sure to go to
[3:12:27] heaven. He said it's not about
[3:12:30] salvation.
[3:12:31] He said it's actually about a
[3:12:33] commemoration.
[3:12:35] He said we're commemorating something
[3:12:37] that has taken place and looking forward
[3:12:40] to something that will be. I'm going to
[3:12:43] drink that wine tonight. And yes, it's
[3:12:44] it's for those of you who've never it's
[3:12:46] it's not grape juice. Grape juice
[3:12:48] spoils. Brother Ram said less than 24
[3:12:50] hours. It can be nothing but wine. It
[3:12:53] gets better with age. Is that right?
[3:12:56] &gt;&gt; And it's not soda cracker. Brother Bram
[3:12:58] said, "I'm I'm against that. I'm against
[3:13:00] substituting the Pascal lamb for a soda
[3:13:03] cracker."
[3:13:05] &gt;&gt; He said, "It's bread and you don't pick
[3:13:07] it up with the It's not loaf bread." He
[3:13:09] said it's bread made by dedicated and
[3:13:11] consecrated hands, by Holy Ghost hands.
[3:13:18] &gt;&gt; It means something.
[3:13:20] &gt;&gt; He tells us in the same manner that the
[3:13:22] Passover that not any of it could last
[3:13:24] until the morning. It had to be burned.
[3:13:27] Brother Bram said, "That's what we do
[3:13:28] with our with our communion elements,
[3:13:30] the bread that represents the pascal
[3:13:31] lamb." He said, "We burn it before the
[3:13:33] morning to remember.
[3:13:37] You You're really going to throw out the
[3:13:39] feast of the Lord and not even use them
[3:13:40] as great teaching points?
[3:13:45] &gt;&gt; You're going to accuse people of trying
[3:13:46] to be Jews because they preach about
[3:13:50] soot tabernacles and Passover." When
[3:13:52] brother Brandham said that communion is
[3:13:53] a commemoration of an annual
[3:13:57] event that took place with the blood on
[3:14:00] the doorpost uh in case you need need
[3:14:02] it. It's in a key to the door and in the
[3:14:05] message ordination. Let let me read
[3:14:07] ordination because uh this one says this
[3:14:10] one says this. He said do you know what
[3:14:12] communion do you know that communion has
[3:14:14] divine healing in it?
[3:14:17] &gt;&gt; Woo.
[3:14:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:14:18] &gt;&gt; When the Israelites in the type took the
[3:14:20] communion in March 40 years and when
[3:14:22] they come out of the wilderness.
[3:14:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:14:26] There wasn't a feeble one among them.
[3:14:28] Two and a half million people. He said
[3:14:30] there's power of healing.
[3:14:34] &gt;&gt; In the communion. Do you know why?
[3:14:36] Because it not only represents a broken
[3:14:38] body of our Lord and the shedding of his
[3:14:39] blood. It also represents the marriage
[3:14:42] supper of the lamb where there will be
[3:14:44] no sickness, no pain, no death, no
[3:14:45] grave, no burden, no sorrow, no
[3:14:47] heartache. Come on.
[3:14:49] &gt;&gt; It means this. It prophesies that it's
[3:14:53] more than unleavened bread and wine.
[3:14:56] &gt;&gt; There's healing in it. He said in
[3:14:59] Abraham's seed as soon as the battle was
[3:15:00] over. What did he bring out? Bread and
[3:15:02] wine. The communion. They took
[3:15:03] communion. After the battle was over,
[3:15:05] let's fight now. Let's fight now. Let's
[3:15:08] bring back the lost brother. Jesus said,
[3:15:10] "I'll drink it a new with you in the
[3:15:13] father's kingdom." When
[3:15:17] &gt;&gt; he said that a lot after the battle's
[3:15:19] over. Amen. Melzdc came out, met
[3:15:22] Abraham, and what did he do?
[3:15:25] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[3:15:26] &gt;&gt; Gave him communion.
[3:15:29] &gt;&gt; In a message called perfection. Yes, I'm
[3:15:31] squeezing in.
[3:15:34] &gt;&gt; Who is this king of Salem? The great
[3:15:36] king of Jerusalem. Not the earthly. Not
[3:15:38] the earthly. The heavenly. The earthly.
[3:15:41] Jerusalem is a type of the heavenly. Did
[3:15:42] you hear that? Yes, sir.
[3:15:43] &gt;&gt; Are you sure you heard that?
[3:15:45] &gt;&gt; What's all this talk about Jerusalem?
[3:15:47] There it is.
[3:15:49] The earthly is a type of the heavenly
[3:15:52] in antitype. The heavenly is a type of
[3:15:54] the earthly. And here come the king of
[3:15:56] Salem, which is the first king of
[3:15:57] righteousness, the king of peace. He
[3:15:58] didn't have any father, didn't have any
[3:16:00] mother, didn't have any beginning of
[3:16:01] life. How do we know that? Because the
[3:16:02] Bible tells us so. And for you that
[3:16:04] don't know where. Write this down. Write
[3:16:06] this down. I didn't have time. Hebrews 7
[3:16:09] 1-3. Read all of seven. Read all of
[3:16:12] eight. Read part of nine or all of nine.
[3:16:14] &gt;&gt; And you'll see that this Melzdc is a big
[3:16:17] deal. He's not God. I mean, he's not
[3:16:19] Jesus Christ.
[3:16:22] &gt;&gt; He's God in spirit and in essence.
[3:16:25] &gt;&gt; He was more like a theophony body. He
[3:16:27] was not born. He was created.
[3:16:31] He was a prefigure
[3:16:34] of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[3:16:38] It's powerful.
[3:16:41] Why? because only Jesus could execute
[3:16:45] through his death, shedding of blood,
[3:16:47] and resurrection the eternal life that
[3:16:49] would be necessary to get us all the way
[3:16:51] through to the millennium.
[3:16:55] And and in verse three, Hebrews there uh
[3:16:58] Hebrews uh 7:3 it said, "Without father,
[3:17:01] without mother, without descent, without
[3:17:03] descent, he had he had no ancestry,
[3:17:06] having neither beginning of days, but
[3:17:08] made like unto the son of God." And like
[3:17:10] like Psalms said, he abideth.
[3:17:13] Read it.
[3:17:16] And in that message, perfection.
[3:17:18] Oh my. Without a descent. None other
[3:17:20] than Christ himself. This is 88. None
[3:17:23] other than Christ himself. That's who
[3:17:25] the church meets when they go up in the
[3:17:26] air. And when Abraham met him, he gave
[3:17:28] him tithe of all that he possessed. No
[3:17:30] wonder he did. He recognized this man is
[3:17:33] not of the earth.
[3:17:35] &gt;&gt; There's something about this man. He has
[3:17:37] brought me coming back. He's met me
[3:17:39] coming back from the slaughter of the
[3:17:40] king. He doesn't chastise me or condemn
[3:17:43] me for the blood on my feet.
[3:17:45] &gt;&gt; Right?
[3:17:46] &gt;&gt; He just serves me bread and wine. And
[3:17:50] all I know is I fall down and I have to
[3:17:52] give him tithe of everything that I
[3:17:53] possess. And I'm glad he did. And so was
[3:17:56] Levi
[3:17:57] &gt;&gt; because it was accounted unto Levi
[3:18:01] &gt;&gt; for paying tithes while he was yet in
[3:18:02] the loins. Glory be to God. This word is
[3:18:05] rich.
[3:18:07] none other than Christ. That that's who
[3:18:09] the church meets when they go. And when
[3:18:10] they, you know what they did? The first
[3:18:12] thing they did was sat down. He said, "I
[3:18:15] feel really emotional." Sat down and
[3:18:17] broke bread and drank wine and taken the
[3:18:20] communion. When? When?
[3:18:26] &gt;&gt; I want to hear you scream that after the
[3:18:27] battle's over.
[3:18:31] &gt;&gt; It ain't over yet.
[3:18:34] &gt;&gt; It potentially. potentially it's over.
[3:18:38] But we're still having to appropriate
[3:18:42] &gt;&gt; some victory every day.
[3:18:44] &gt;&gt; I have to choose every day.
[3:18:48] &gt;&gt; My emotions demand that I have to choose
[3:18:52] every day self-control.
[3:18:57] &gt;&gt; Do you ever have to do that? Do you ever
[3:18:59] have to exercise self-control when your
[3:19:02] emotions get out of whack? Do you ever
[3:19:04] have to do that? You ever want to be
[3:19:06] mad? Does Brother Greley ever make you
[3:19:08] mad? Don't answer that.
[3:19:10] Do you ever feel mad? Do you ever feel
[3:19:12] mad? You ever feel like things are just
[3:19:14] rotten around you at times? You just get
[3:19:16] upset and and you have to choose
[3:19:19] self-control.
[3:19:22] &gt;&gt; You ever want to just throw up your
[3:19:23] hands and quit all of it?
[3:19:27] Do you know how many times in 50 years
[3:19:30] I've resigned?
[3:19:35] Do you know how many times in 35 years
[3:19:37] of pastoring this church alone and
[3:19:40] visiting 64 nations of the world in
[3:19:42] person to preach the gospel?
[3:19:45] Do you know how many times I've wanted
[3:19:46] to just quit?
[3:19:49] Do do you know how many times I've just
[3:19:52] decided that people just ain't worth it?
[3:19:58] You say, "Well, you're just a heathen."
[3:19:59] You have no right to be up there
[3:20:01] preaching to us. If you think that
[3:20:02] people aren't worth it, let me tell you
[3:20:04] something. Any of us can go through the
[3:20:06] long dark night of the soul.
[3:20:08] &gt;&gt; Any of us can reach a crisis. Any of us
[3:20:11] can go through a a a second childhood
[3:20:15] kind of kind of uh you know what do they
[3:20:17] call that? Uh uh maleopause. No
[3:20:22] menopause.
[3:20:24] Men menopause.
[3:20:32] Midlife crisis. That's right.
[3:20:35] What do you just think?
[3:20:38] And while some of us just sit around and
[3:20:40] think, I like speed. I need speed. I
[3:20:43] want speed. I want the wind flopping
[3:20:46] through my brother Stephen. He just does
[3:20:48] it. He just does it while we sit on the
[3:20:52] sidelines and say, "Oh, I'd love to feel
[3:20:54] that."
[3:20:56] But I I personally have no intention.
[3:20:59] I'm not going to ride a bicycle either,
[3:21:01] so I'm certainly not going to ride a
[3:21:02] motorcycle, but I I feel the need
[3:21:05] sometime. I see the thrill.
[3:21:09] I wouldn't jump out of a perfectly good
[3:21:11] airplane,
[3:21:14] but I understand that you come to places
[3:21:16] in your life where you feel like, I just
[3:21:18] need another thrill. I just need another
[3:21:20] something. You know, I just I just And
[3:21:23] people are just trouble. Sheep stink.
[3:21:32] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm a sheep. I know. I know how we
[3:21:35] stink. But I have to exercise
[3:21:37] self-control.
[3:21:42] You reckon in 50 years the devil's ever
[3:21:44] said, "Why don't you just get drunk and
[3:21:46] forget it all?" You're not going to tell
[3:21:48] us you have heard that. Oh yes.
[3:21:54] Maybe that's why we go 5 years without
[3:21:56] taking communion.
[3:22:00] Cuz I'm afraid of what a sip will do.
[3:22:01] But I have to exercise self-control
[3:22:05] because it's worth it to choose him and
[3:22:08] to keep choosing him and to keep
[3:22:10] choosing his people and to keep choosing
[3:22:13] to do what you were born to do. It's
[3:22:15] worth it in the end because one day
[3:22:19] after the battle is over,
[3:22:24] &gt;&gt; the Mechazedc of heaven is going to
[3:22:27] serve this little bride bread
[3:22:31] [Music]
[3:22:35] &gt;&gt; and wine.
[3:22:38] &gt;&gt; Woo!
[3:22:41] I can't not make it. I can't afford to
[3:22:46] give up now.
[3:22:48] &gt;&gt; I got to fight.
[3:22:50] &gt;&gt; The victory doesn't come till after the
[3:22:52] battle.
[3:22:54] &gt;&gt; Would you stand? Lord,
[3:22:57] help us.
[3:23:00] &gt;&gt; Strengthen us.
[3:23:03] &gt;&gt; We can't slow down
[3:23:06] &gt;&gt; until after the battle. All right.
[3:23:10] &gt;&gt; We must prepare our hearts
[3:23:13] to receive refugees
[3:23:16] of spiritual warfare.
[3:23:20] Broken,
[3:23:21] bruised,
[3:23:23] moping, tattered eagles.
[3:23:31] Calcium
[3:23:33] deposits
[3:23:34] have nearly choked out their brea their
[3:23:38] breathing ability.
[3:23:40] Their talons brittle and broken and
[3:23:43] bloody.
[3:23:46] They're in the greatest battle ever
[3:23:49] fought.
[3:23:51] And once in a while we have this moment
[3:23:56] to remember his broken body.
[3:23:59] and his blood
[3:24:02] and it prophesies forward while
[3:24:05] reminding us of what he has done and it
[3:24:10] is supposed to give us I can maybe show
[3:24:12] you read it a little bit tonight maybe
[3:24:15] it's supposed to give us the boost
[3:24:19] we get our eyes out there on that moment
[3:24:22] when the battle's over and it's supposed
[3:24:25] to give us a lift I can fight on
[3:24:29] for the moment, for the moment, for the
[3:24:31] moment, for the moment that he slides
[3:24:34] the cup across the table and says, "Take
[3:24:37] a big drink." I told my disciples I
[3:24:40] wouldn't taste it until I could taste it
[3:24:43] with all of my disciples, with all of my
[3:24:46] wife, with all of my sons in the new
[3:24:50] kingdom. And now the battle's over
[3:24:54] and we're going to sit down
[3:24:57] at that table
[3:25:00] spread a million miles
[3:25:03] and testify
[3:25:05] how we made it over.
[3:25:08] The preachers do a great job
[3:25:11] reminding us that there will be those
[3:25:12] who say, "What age did you come out of?"
[3:25:16] And you'll say, "Leodysa."
[3:25:20] And somebody might look across and say
[3:25:22] to you, Leodysia,
[3:25:25] the most evil of all the ages, how did
[3:25:28] you hold on? How did you make it all the
[3:25:31] way? If you would have said this age or
[3:25:34] that age or Philadelphiaian age, but but
[3:25:35] you said Leodysia, the most evil, how
[3:25:38] did you make it over?
[3:25:40] And your answer will be the same as the
[3:25:42] Ephesian bride and the Thyaran bride and
[3:25:46] the Sardissian bride and the all that
[3:25:49] Pergamian bride. all a little bride.
[3:25:52] It'll be the same.
[3:25:54] &gt;&gt; By the blood of the lamb,
[3:25:56] &gt;&gt; by the grace of almighty God,
[3:26:00] &gt;&gt; by the word of my testimony,
[3:26:03] &gt;&gt; I've made it over.
[3:26:05] I've got my eye on the kingdom. Do you
[3:26:07] have your eye on the kingdom?
[3:26:09] &gt;&gt; Would you just bow your head a moment
[3:26:11] while your eye is on the on the on the
[3:26:13] Lord Jesus Christ? And the spirit of God
[3:26:16] would woo you in this moment if
[3:26:18] possible. If you're not so weary, so
[3:26:21] tired, you can't hear his pull, and
[3:26:24] maybe you'll find faith to respond.
[3:26:26] I feel like the Lord is reaching out to
[3:26:29] us
[3:26:30] in this pivotal moment
[3:26:33] in in in this divine pivot
[3:26:38] in this moment of of reset
[3:26:43] in this turning point
[3:26:46] as we keep hearing in our nation.
[3:26:49] May this little church, may this little
[3:26:51] people, this faith community, may we
[3:26:53] have our turning point. May we have our
[3:26:54] divine pivot. May we may we drive our
[3:26:59] stakes down deeper
[3:27:02] &gt;&gt; into the ground. May we have greater
[3:27:05] determination to choose Christ and his
[3:27:07] righteousness today and again tonight
[3:27:10] and again tomorrow and again the next
[3:27:12] day and again the next day. When we feel
[3:27:16] like giving up, may we realize that
[3:27:18] after the battle's over and the victory
[3:27:20] is ours, there'll no longer be a reason
[3:27:23] to even think of giving up. Keep your
[3:27:25] eye on the prize, your hand on the plow.
[3:27:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:27:31] And press on.
[3:27:36] I wrestled all night one night many
[3:27:38] years ago in the prayer chapel with a
[3:27:41] young man who had moved here from the
[3:27:42] Carolas with his little family.
[3:27:46] God showed me that night in vision that
[3:27:49] he was going to make a choice in the
[3:27:52] near future that would cause his hand to
[3:27:55] slip off the plow.
[3:27:58] But in that vision, I saw as the strap
[3:28:02] of that beast of burden caught on his
[3:28:07] leg
[3:28:09] and the beast of burden drug him through
[3:28:12] the field.
[3:28:14] I hadn't thought of that vision in a
[3:28:17] long time. That poor man has suffered
[3:28:19] and paid such a price for the foolish
[3:28:22] decision that he made. But as I was
[3:28:24] going through old papers,
[3:28:26] I found a file. this week, Joshua. That
[3:28:29] was what I was carrying this morning.
[3:28:31] And I and I I started looking through
[3:28:33] those loose papers and I saw there the
[3:28:36] vision and the date and the night that
[3:28:38] we wrestled in the prayer chapel and I
[3:28:40] said,"I see my brother Randy
[3:28:44] and he has taken his hand off the plow
[3:28:48] and I saw that beast of burden dragging
[3:28:50] him through the field
[3:28:53] and it makes you want to scream, "Oh
[3:28:55] brother, don't you turn loose of the
[3:28:57] plow now?
[3:28:59] Hold on.
[3:29:02] The battle is soon over and the cup will
[3:29:05] be in your hand.
[3:29:07] Don't you dare give up or give in. Now,
[3:29:10] if you're here and you've been feeling
[3:29:13] this uh divine frustration in your
[3:29:16] spiritual life, that there's more for
[3:29:18] you, that you've got to pull up a little
[3:29:21] higher, that you've got to run on a
[3:29:23] little farther, that there is something
[3:29:25] else that God would have you to do. If
[3:29:28] you've been experiencing that in this
[3:29:30] season, I want you to come right now. We
[3:29:33] don't have to play soft music. We don't
[3:29:35] have to sing a sweet song. All we have
[3:29:38] to do is invite you to come. There's
[3:29:41] nothing to be ashamed of or embarrassed
[3:29:43] about. In fact, the scripture says, "At
[3:29:46] the noise of thy water spouts, the deep
[3:29:49] calleth to the deep." There are times
[3:29:53] that we walk satisfied,
[3:29:56] justified,
[3:29:58] feeling good and clean before the Lord,
[3:30:01] like we have finally won some victory. I
[3:30:06] thank God for those seasons. I thank God
[3:30:10] for those moments where you know that
[3:30:13] it's not you, it's him. All you did was
[3:30:17] say yes. But then there are those
[3:30:19] moments of eb and flow. You can play now
[3:30:23] something soft. Those moments of eb and
[3:30:26] flow where you no longer feel the
[3:30:29] confidence that you once felt. In fact,
[3:30:33] you feel like the limb that you've been
[3:30:35] hanging on to is about to fall off the
[3:30:39] tree. And the only way you can survive
[3:30:42] is to reach up and take a hold of a
[3:30:44] higher limb. In doing so, my brother,
[3:30:47] sister, you climb a little higher.
[3:30:49] &gt;&gt; You get up a little higher. Oh God, take
[3:30:51] us higher. Oh God, give us eagle's
[3:30:54] wings. Take us a little higher. May your
[3:30:58] divine frustration, may the deep calling
[3:31:01] to the deep not be something that turns
[3:31:03] you off or causes you to run the other
[3:31:06] direction. May it be a zeal pulling you.
[3:31:10] May it be the wooing of the Holy Spirit.
[3:31:15] [Music]
[3:31:22] May it just be an invitation.
[3:31:26] Press on saints.
[3:31:28] Press on my brother. Press on my sister.
[3:31:33] It's not your perfection. It's his. It's
[3:31:36] not your righteousness.
[3:31:39] It's his.
[3:31:41] It's not even your zeal.
[3:31:44] It's his.
[3:31:46] It's not your burden. It's his. And if
[3:31:50] you really see it all the way through,
[3:31:52] the battle's not even yours.
[3:31:57] It's like God told little David, "The
[3:31:59] battle belongs to the Lord." David said,
[3:32:01] "This isn't our battle.
[3:32:04] This is the Lord's battle."
[3:32:08] [Music]
[3:32:10] If that great magnet is passing over
[3:32:13] your head
[3:32:15] and you're feeling an upward pull,
[3:32:18] yield it. Yield to it.
[3:32:22] Carry me, Lord.
[3:32:24] When I can't walk myself
[3:32:27] &gt;&gt; carry me, Lord.
[3:32:30] This is the time
[3:32:32] when true worshippers
[3:32:34] [Music]
[3:32:37] will worship him.
[3:32:40] These are the days when the father's
[3:32:42] ways
[3:32:43] will be known to man in ways they've
[3:32:46] never been known before. Will you press
[3:32:48] on? Will you go so your children can go?
[3:32:52] Will you go so your grandchildren can
[3:32:54] go?
[3:32:56] Will you swear off today? lukewarm
[3:33:00] Christianity.
[3:33:03] Will you begin today to despise
[3:33:07] the comfort zone that has held you for
[3:33:10] so long?
[3:33:14] &gt;&gt; And will you press?
[3:33:17] &gt;&gt; Will you press?
[3:33:19] Instead of standing here thinking of
[3:33:22] what a price I've paid,
[3:33:25] may it leave my mind and may I calculate
[3:33:28] a way.
[3:33:30] May I compute a way to pay a greater
[3:33:34] price.
[3:33:37] Lord Jesus.
[3:33:40] Oh God,
[3:33:43] I've wasted so much time
[3:33:46] in 50 years of ministry.
[3:33:49] [Music]
[3:33:51] I can't get it back.
[3:33:55] There have been times I coasted when I
[3:33:58] should have been climbing,
[3:34:00] but I can't get it back.
[3:34:03] It haunts me.
[3:34:08] It started haunting me when I turned 50.
[3:34:12] And that was seven years ago.
[3:34:14] It still haunts me today.
[3:34:18] The only hope I have is that
[3:34:21] he gives grace to redeem the time.
[3:34:25] I want to dig deeper, ditches.
[3:34:29] I want to put my shoulder to the plow
[3:34:33] and press harder than I've ever pressed
[3:34:35] before.
[3:34:37] [Music]
[3:34:38] I don't have much patience for petty
[3:34:40] criticisms
[3:34:43] and silly whinings,
[3:34:47] but I have a burden and a zeal
[3:34:51] to see a people overcome
[3:34:54] their issues
[3:34:57] and then reach down and pick up somebody
[3:34:59] else and say, "If I got out of it, you
[3:35:02] can. If I escaped the slime pit,
[3:35:06] you can.
[3:35:09] If God delivered me from pornography,
[3:35:13] if God delivered me from this or that or
[3:35:15] the other, I know he can deliver you.
[3:35:18] How many of you want to be that helping
[3:35:20] hand to rescue a fallen brother
[3:35:25] so that when the battle's over,
[3:35:28] [Music]
[3:35:34] Father's ways will be known to men.
[3:35:42] And this is the hour when the spirit's
[3:35:48] power will move again
[3:35:53] across
[3:35:55] this land as we worship
[3:35:59] him in spirit
[3:36:02] and in truth.
[3:36:11] This is the time when true worshipers
[3:36:18] will worship
[3:36:20] him.
[3:36:24] &gt;&gt; And these are the days when my father's
[3:36:29] ways will be known.
[3:36:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, church as usual.
[3:36:36] &gt;&gt; I'm going to have more. Since the hour
[3:36:39] when the spirit's
[3:36:41] power it will move again
[3:36:46] across
[3:36:48] this land. Oh, as we worship
[3:36:52] him in spirit
[3:36:55] and in truth.
[3:36:59] Search us today, Lord. Search our
[3:37:01] hearts.
[3:37:03] Oh, this is the time when true
[3:37:08] worshipers
[3:37:11] will worship.
[3:37:17] &gt;&gt; These are the days when my father's
[3:37:22] ways will be known
[3:37:25] to me.
[3:37:26] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[3:37:29] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. This is the hour when the
[3:37:32] spirit's
[3:37:34] power will move again
[3:37:39] across
[3:37:41] this land as we worship
[3:37:45] him in spirit
[3:37:48] and in truth.
[3:37:52] Just hold the song. Don't sing for a
[3:37:55] minute. Keep playing.
[3:38:01] [Music]
[3:38:04] I want you to tell the Lord. I want you
[3:38:06] to tell the Lord something.
[3:38:09] Tell him what you need.
[3:38:12] Tell him what your determination is.
[3:38:15] Tell him what your consecration is. Tell
[3:38:19] him what your new dedication is. Will
[3:38:21] you do it right now? You don't have to
[3:38:22] do it so that anyone else can hear.
[3:38:30] Would you make a covenant with him?
[3:38:34] Would you make a covenant with him right
[3:38:36] now?
[3:38:39] Don't let it be that our hours together
[3:38:41] today would would take us back
[3:38:45] instead of setting us forward.
[3:38:49] Make a commitment to him.
[3:38:52] It's not between you and your preacher.
[3:38:54] It's between you and your savior.
[3:38:57] Lord, help me to run on.
[3:39:03] Tell him what your desire is.
[3:39:08] Ask for his help.
[3:39:12] Don't stand in his presence and make any
[3:39:14] excuse.
[3:39:17] Just say yes.
[3:39:19] If you don't know what to pray, just say
[3:39:21] yes, Lord.
[3:39:23] Whatever. Whatever you call me, whatever
[3:39:25] you tell me, whatever you lead me from
[3:39:27] your word, whatever you need from me.
[3:39:33] [Music]
[3:39:36] That'd be a good starting place
[3:39:39] if somebody would just tell him, "Lord,
[3:39:41] what is it you need from me?
[3:39:43] I'm willing to give it right now.
[3:39:47] [Music]
[3:39:55] Don't let this opportunity pass you by.
[3:40:01] This is the prerequisite.
[3:40:03] [Music]
[3:40:07] Let him give you a fresh vision,
[3:40:10] a fresh zeal.
[3:40:14] Let him give you a new glimpse
[3:40:18] of what eternity waits.
[3:40:22] [Music]
[3:40:23] Tell him, "I'll work on. I'll pray on.
[3:40:26] I'll run on.
[3:40:29] I'll shout on. I'll rejoice on. I'll
[3:40:31] weep on.
[3:40:34] [Music]
[3:40:35] But the one thing I will never do is
[3:40:37] quit." Tell him.
[3:40:40] &gt;&gt; Your general wants to hear from you
[3:40:42] today. He wants to hear from somebody. I
[3:40:44] won't quit.
[3:40:46] &gt;&gt; Tell him.
[3:40:47] &gt;&gt; I will not quit.
[3:40:49] &gt;&gt; I will not quit.
[3:40:50] &gt;&gt; I'll I'll fight till the battle's over.
[3:40:54] I won't let the world charm me. I won't
[3:40:56] let the world
[3:40:59] vex me and pull me.
[3:41:03] And hypnotize me.
[3:41:06] I'll do whatever I have to do to cut off
[3:41:08] its influence.
[3:41:11] I'll stand like a warrior and defend and
[3:41:13] fight for my family. I'll fight for my
[3:41:16] family. I'll fight for my family. I'll
[3:41:19] fight for the fallen brother. I'll fight
[3:41:22] for the fallen sister.
[3:41:27] I'll get over my hurts. I'll get rid of
[3:41:30] my woundedness
[3:41:33] and I'll put my eyes on the prize. He
[3:41:35] wants to hear that from some of you. And
[3:41:37] I wouldn't care if you'd scream it out.
[3:41:39] I wouldn't care. You don't have to, but
[3:41:41] I wouldn't care if you just raise your
[3:41:43] voice and say, "Yes, Jesus."
[3:41:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:41:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:41:51] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't care.
[3:41:53] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't care if somebody else would
[3:41:55] just say, "Yes,
[3:41:57] &gt;&gt; I'll press. I'll fight on."
[3:42:04] Even if it feels like the whole world
[3:42:07] is pushing against me,
[3:42:11] &gt;&gt; I'll put my eye on the prize.
[3:42:15] His name is Jesus.
[3:42:18] &gt;&gt; He's worth the surrender.
[3:42:21] &gt;&gt; Has anybody found him worth the
[3:42:25] surrender?
[3:42:28] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord.
[3:42:29] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord.
[3:42:31] Come here, Benjamin.
[3:42:33] Let me pray for you.
[3:42:38] &gt;&gt; He's worth the surrender.
[3:42:44] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[3:42:46] &gt;&gt; Lord, a fresh dedication,
[3:42:50] &gt;&gt; fresh consecration.
[3:42:54] I've seen what you've been doing in his
[3:42:57] life, Lord,
[3:42:59] &gt;&gt; and I celebrate you.
[3:43:05] I rejoice at his surrender.
[3:43:09] &gt;&gt; Oh God, take him
[3:43:11] &gt;&gt; to deeper places,
[3:43:16] &gt;&gt; to higher heights.
[3:43:19] [Music]
[3:43:25] &gt;&gt; Reveal yourself, Lord,
[3:43:28] in new and fresh ways.
[3:43:31] Lay your hand on somebody near you.
[3:43:35] Take my brother. Take my sister.
[3:43:39] &gt;&gt; Take them deeper. Take them higher.
[3:43:43] [Music]
[3:43:55] &gt;&gt; I didn't want anybody here to feel like
[3:43:57] I'm preaching you lost. Jesus,
[3:44:00] &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching you're lost. I'm
[3:44:03] preaching you're found,
[3:44:08] &gt;&gt; but not by your righteousness or mine.
[3:44:14] The church has got to push on
[3:44:18] [Music]
[3:44:21] &gt;&gt; as we worship him
[3:44:25] &gt;&gt; in spirit and
[3:44:28] in truth. I'm aware I'm aware of the
[3:44:32] late hour.
[3:44:33] [Music]
[3:44:35] Oh, this is the time
[3:44:39] when true worshiper
[3:44:42] [Music]
[3:44:47] Sing it.
[3:44:49] And these are the days
[3:44:55] other's ways will be known to me.
[3:45:01] &gt;&gt; Let this be the day. And this is the
[3:45:07] hour when the spirit's
[3:45:10] power will move again
[3:45:15] across
[3:45:17] this land as we worship
[3:45:21] him.
[3:45:21] &gt;&gt; That's right. In spirit
[3:45:24] and
[3:45:26] in truth.
[3:45:29] &gt;&gt; Wave your hand at him. Wave your hand,
[3:45:31] somebody. Here I am, Lord.
[3:45:34] I surrender.
[3:45:36] &gt;&gt; I surrender my stubbornness.
[3:45:39] [Music]
[3:45:41] &gt;&gt; Somebody tell him you're tired of being
[3:45:43] stubborn. You're ready to be bendable
[3:45:46] and moldable and pliable.
[3:45:48] &gt;&gt; These are the days.
[3:45:50] &gt;&gt; Tell him I'm tired of carrying this chip
[3:45:52] on my shoulder.
[3:45:55] &gt;&gt; I'm ready to be out from under the
[3:45:57] heaviness.
[3:46:01] &gt;&gt; Come out here, Lord. This is the hour. I
[3:46:05] surrender. Spirit's power. I surrender.
[3:46:08] We'll move again across across
[3:46:13] this land.
[3:46:14] &gt;&gt; I surrender
[3:46:15] &gt;&gt; as we worship
[3:46:17] him in spirit
[3:46:21] and in truth.
[3:46:24] &gt;&gt; I surrender. I surrender. I surrender. I
[3:46:27] surrender. I surrender.
[3:46:30] This is the time and worshipers
[3:46:36] we worship.
[3:46:39] [Music]
[3:46:40] [Laughter]
[3:46:43] And these are the days when my father's
[3:46:49] ways will be known to me. I surrender.
[3:46:57] And this is surrender
[3:47:01] &gt;&gt; when the spirit's
[3:47:03] power will move again
[3:47:08] across this land
[3:47:11] &gt;&gt; as we worship
[3:47:14] him. Tell him somebody
[3:47:19] in truth.
[3:47:21] Tell him
[3:47:23] &gt;&gt; just another minute. Helen. Oh, this is
[3:47:27] the time when trueers
[3:47:33] will worship
[3:47:35] him.
[3:47:40] &gt;&gt; These are the days in my father's way
[3:47:46] will be known to you.
[3:47:49] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, you heard your cry.
[3:47:51] [Music]
[3:47:54] This is the hour.
[3:47:57] Honor, Lord. Honor, honor. Honor that
[3:48:01] Lord. You said you would.
[3:48:03] &gt;&gt; You said you would lost this land as we
[3:48:08] were.
[3:48:09] &gt;&gt; You said you would. It's our heart that
[3:48:12] cries
[3:48:14] in truth.
[3:48:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, I press on.
[3:48:19] I sail on. I believe on.
[3:48:23] This is the time when
[3:48:28] we worship
[3:48:31] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[3:48:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[3:48:35] &gt;&gt; And these are the days.
[3:48:38] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus.
[3:48:39] &gt;&gt; Then my father's
[3:48:41] ways will be known to men.
[3:48:48] Oh yes. And this is the hour when the
[3:48:53] spirit's
[3:48:55] power it will move again all across
[3:49:01] this land as we worship
[3:49:05] you
[3:49:07] in spirit
[3:49:09] and in
[3:49:13] oh we prepare our hearts for this week
[3:49:16] into
[3:49:18] thy my chamber
[3:49:21] be free. Holy
[3:49:24] Spirit,
[3:49:24] &gt;&gt; bless our precious nature to me
[3:49:32] as I close the door
[3:49:35] &gt;&gt; from the Netherlands. Lord,
[3:49:38] &gt;&gt; finally
[3:49:41] to us that not
[3:49:43] &gt;&gt; visit them this week covered.
[3:49:47] Visit him in ways that you never have
[3:49:50] before. And he
[3:49:52] is all.
[3:49:54] &gt;&gt; May they know you in the power of your
[3:49:58] resurrection.
[3:50:00] Thy chamber
[3:50:02] to be free.
[3:50:04] &gt;&gt; May they have their own personal
[3:50:06] experience.
[3:50:08] Speak to me gently so that if you dare
[3:50:13] it,
[3:50:15] &gt;&gt; they can raise their children to desire
[3:50:17] it
[3:50:19] to know that it's possible
[3:50:21] to meet the pillar of fire.
[3:50:23] &gt;&gt; Let thy presence come. Strengthen them.
[3:50:28] Sustain them
[3:50:31] unending
[3:50:33] is all I long for.
[3:50:37] [Music]
[3:50:39] Now on
[3:50:41] my pathway
[3:50:44] though I press falls heavy
[3:50:48] but it's bringing
[3:50:51] forth only
[3:50:53] the best of the wine.
[3:50:58] So I pressed for
[3:51:01] the mark for the prize of high calling
[3:51:07] to be a part of that beautiful
[3:51:16] bride
[3:51:18] and into
[3:51:20] thy chamber.
[3:51:22] Do it.

[3:51:28] speak to
[3:51:30] me gently
[3:51:33] as I call us over
[3:51:38] &gt;&gt; and heaven
[3:51:41] covering

[3:52:29] &gt;&gt; So into
[3:52:31] submission
[3:52:33] what you
[3:52:34] &gt;&gt; I surrender
[3:52:37] today
[3:52:39] and into
[3:52:42] thy chamber. Won't you be free? Holy
[3:52:47] Spirit,
[3:52:50] speak to me gently.
[3:52:54] As I close the door,
[3:53:00] heavenly
[3:53:02] lover

[3:53:26] Holy

[3:53:40] and heavenly
[3:53:43] lover,
[3:53:45] let thy presence
[3:53:48] cover.
[3:53:50] Oh shina,
[3:53:53] unending
[3:53:55] is all I long for.
[3:54:01] Now on
[3:54:03] my pathway
[3:54:06] the wine dress falls heavy
[3:54:11] but it's bringing
[3:54:13] forth only
[3:54:16] the best of the wise around. So I
[3:54:21] pressed toward
[3:54:23] the mark for
[3:54:26] the prize of high calling to be a part
[3:54:32] of that beautiful
[3:54:36] lady
[3:54:38] thy bride.

[3:54:49] spirit?
[3:54:50] &gt;&gt; Speak into those deep places.
[3:54:52] &gt;&gt; Won't you speak to
[3:54:55] me, Lord, as I close the door forward
[3:55:02] in heaven
[3:55:04] belove his hope. Let thy

[3:55:11] [Music]

[3:55:17] &gt;&gt; He's all I wishes
[3:55:21] that he goes for
[3:55:26] chamber.
[3:55:27] [Music]
[3:55:33] speak to
[3:55:36] begin
[3:55:38] as I call awaken the seat of destiny in
[3:55:44] awakenly
[3:55:46] lover.
[3:55:48] Let thy presence
[3:55:51] cover do what we can
[3:55:56] unending.
[3:55:59] Oh, it's all I long for.
[3:56:04] Father,
[3:56:07] I worship
[3:56:09] you out of my spirit,
[3:56:15] blessing
[3:56:17] and thanking
[3:56:20] you in my own way.
[3:56:25] Your heart
[3:56:27] I cover it,
[3:56:30] Lord. Your will and purpose.
[3:56:35] So into
[3:56:38] submission
[3:56:40] I surrender
[3:56:43] today.
[3:56:44] &gt;&gt; One last time. Sing into it
[3:56:46] &gt;&gt; and into
[3:56:48] thy chamber. Oh, you be free. Holy
[3:56:54] Spirit, speak to me, J. Just speak to
[3:56:59] me gently
[3:57:01] as I close the door.
[3:57:06] in heavenly
[3:57:08] [Music]
[3:57:09] lover.
[3:57:11] Let thy presence
[3:57:15] cover.
[3:57:17] Shakina
[3:57:20] unending
[3:57:22] is all I long for.
[3:57:28] Shina
[3:57:34] is all I
[3:57:37] long for.
[3:57:40] Isn't he good?
[3:57:42] &gt;&gt; I I said, isn't he good?
[3:57:46] &gt;&gt; He's so good. He's so good.
[3:57:51] [Applause]
[3:57:56] It's 3:00
[3:57:59] 2:52.
[3:58:01] Um, we can't change that now, can we?
[3:58:04] So, need no need to talk about it. I
[3:58:07] want you to turn to somebody and greet
[3:58:09] them wholeheartedly. Hug them tight if
[3:58:12] it's appropriate to do so. If it's not,
[3:58:15] don't do it.
[3:58:19] In a moment when the spirit of the
[3:58:21] Lord's moving like that, you could just
[3:58:22] hug anybody.
[3:58:25] Wouldn't be any gender, would you? You'd
[3:58:28] just hug a sister like you would a
[3:58:29] brother. But
[3:58:32] we don't want to get in the habit of
[3:58:33] that.
[3:58:36] We're setting an example.
[3:58:41] Pray for the strength of these musicians
[3:58:46] for the week ahead. Slip to your seats
[3:58:49] as you can.
[3:58:52] We won't terry.
[3:58:56] It's time to be back.
[3:58:59] Just a couple things.
[3:59:03] I appreciate any visitor who understands
[3:59:08] our position this evening.
[3:59:11] Be seated just a moment.
[3:59:14] Brother Brandon was always so good and
[3:59:15] faithful to say that this is a open
[3:59:19] communion.
[3:59:22] So I sure have felt terrible about
[3:59:25] doing anything different.
[3:59:28] But uh there was a bit of an assignment
[3:59:31] that came from the Lord and I'd rather
[3:59:33] please him and be done. I hope no one
[3:59:37] will be offended.
[3:59:39] We will gather back. Do you think we can
[3:59:42] do it at 6? It's 3 hours.
[3:59:48] You all seem so excited.
[3:59:54] Well, let's do it at five then. Will
[3:59:56] that excite you more?
[3:59:59] I'm ready. We could do it now for all I
[4:00:02] care
[4:00:03] and be done.
[4:00:05] go and get some lunch and uh
[4:00:09] if not fast, do that.
[4:00:12] Let's come back at six o'clock. We'll
[4:00:14] have a moment or two of worship, a few
[4:00:15] comments,
[4:00:17] and we will receive communion and the
[4:00:19] washing of the saints feet.
[4:00:21] If you're unsure about whether you
[4:00:24] should be here or not, just I'll be glad
[4:00:27] to answer any question that you have.
[4:00:29] I've tried to make myself available
[4:00:31] through this week. You know, you know,
[4:00:36] there's just a couple things I have
[4:00:38] mentioned and one is you should have,
[4:00:40] you should be baptized. Brother Brandham
[4:00:43] says clearly, you should be baptized in
[4:00:45] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[4:00:49] You should do that before communion.
[4:00:54] Everybody with me?
[4:00:57] &gt;&gt; Uh
[4:00:59] oh, I forgot that. live. Baniah's
[4:01:03] birthday is on the 7th, too. Is that
[4:01:06] right?
[4:01:08] Wow.
[4:01:10] He hasn't made it to the calendar yet.
[4:01:13] One year old
[4:01:15] on October the 7th.
[4:01:19] Is that right?
[4:01:22] That's redemption for an ugly day.
[4:01:26] Not my daughter's birthday,
[4:01:29] but uh terrible things have taken place.
[4:01:32] May it soon be over.
[4:01:34] Those poor families have their loved
[4:01:37] ones home, dead or alive, they would
[4:01:40] desire to have them home regardless.
[4:01:45] I was going to read it to you quickly.
[4:01:48] I was going to say, I don't know, Sister
[4:01:50] Darthy, I I want you to know you may not
[4:01:52] be able after this long service, but if
[4:01:54] you're able, I would love for you to be
[4:01:56] here this evening.
[4:01:58] You're so welcome.
[4:02:01] You faithfully, when you're not able to
[4:02:03] be here, you faithfully support the work
[4:02:06] of the Lord.
[4:02:07] I appreciate it.
[4:02:10] Uh
[4:02:12] I'll get in a minute.
[4:02:16] It's on the app, isn't it?
[4:02:19] Yes, pastor,
[4:02:21] it is.
[4:02:23] In Future Home, 1964,
[4:02:26] August the 2nd, Brother Brandham says
[4:02:28] boldly, "No man, no person, no woman,
[4:02:31] boy, girl, I don't care who he is, is
[4:02:35] fit to go in the pull pit or even claim
[4:02:38] to be a Christian without being filled
[4:02:41] with the Holy Ghost." Yes.
[4:02:44] &gt;&gt; Now, that's not to offend anybody.
[4:02:45] That's to drive you to want him
[4:02:49] &gt;&gt; and to be filled with him. You have no
[4:02:53] right to the Lord's supper or anything
[4:02:56] until you've been cleansed by the holy
[4:02:59] fire of God.
[4:03:02] I would prefer that you all get the
[4:03:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost now.
[4:03:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. rather than later if you don't
[4:03:11] know.
[4:03:13] But if you have been baptized in the
[4:03:15] name of the Lord Jesus Christ, you're
[4:03:18] part of this local assembly. You support
[4:03:20] it with your attendance and your and
[4:03:23] your uh giving and your prayers and
[4:03:25] you're here and you know what's being
[4:03:27] preached and you follow what's going on.
[4:03:30] It would be an honor to serve you
[4:03:31] communion and the washing of the saints
[4:03:33] feet tonight. other otherwise you
[4:03:36] streamers this is your church it's not
[4:03:40] ideal it's not ideal to have a pastor
[4:03:44] hours away
[4:03:46] but if this is your
[4:03:50] position now and and and you claim this
[4:03:53] church as yours of course please come
[4:03:57] and let us serve you communion and
[4:03:58] footwashing otherwise we're just going
[4:04:00] to keep it for this local body this
[4:04:02] evening it grieves me to do it that that
[4:04:05] way, but we will in obedience.
[4:04:09] If you've been baptized, now they ask
[4:04:12] about children. Brother Brandham said,
[4:04:14] "If a child is old enough to ask to be
[4:04:16] baptized, he's old enough to be
[4:04:18] baptized." That doesn't mean he
[4:04:20] understands or she understands all there
[4:04:22] is to understand about it. It just means
[4:04:25] they've got the desire. You talk to them
[4:04:27] about it and they're willing to go
[4:04:29] through with it and then they're bapt
[4:04:30] you baptize them. That's the right thing
[4:04:32] to do. That doesn't mean that later they
[4:04:34] might understand more and want to be
[4:04:36] baptized. So you may see some younger
[4:04:38] ones come through and receive the
[4:04:41] communion. It will be because they have
[4:04:42] been baptized in the name of the Lord
[4:04:44] Jesus Christ. Please parents, if you're
[4:04:47] children or teenagers or whatever have
[4:04:49] not been baptized,
[4:04:51] please don't uh don't uh in push them or
[4:04:55] encourage them to receive the communion.
[4:04:57] They can come through in the line with
[4:04:58] you. It's all right. Family sticking
[4:05:00] together. It's beautiful.
[4:05:04] There will be for the first time in 35
[4:05:07] years,
[4:05:09] there will be a little tray down here
[4:05:10] with some little glass cups for those of
[4:05:14] you who feel for some reason you would
[4:05:17] like to take one.
[4:05:19] I had a precious person reach out in a
[4:05:23] nice well-written email
[4:05:27] strongly urging me to change the
[4:05:31] communion policy which I have no
[4:05:33] intention of doing whatsoever.
[4:05:38] It is if we understand what brother
[4:05:41] said. He said it was Passover. You read
[4:05:43] the scriptures. He handed them the cup.
[4:05:46] He told them to divide it among
[4:05:47] themselves. that means
[4:05:50] get your sip.
[4:05:54] But I understand that there are concerns
[4:05:57] that people have. So So for the like I
[4:05:59] said, the first time in 35 years, I
[4:06:01] didn't buy some little fancy tray to put
[4:06:03] them in because I I was going to because
[4:06:06] I didn't want anybody to feel like they
[4:06:07] weren't special if they chose that. But
[4:06:09] it was going to be $59 to have a little
[4:06:11] tray with holes in it. And I just said,
[4:06:14] "No, I'm going I'm not I'm not going to
[4:06:16] I'll There'll be a little tray. There'll
[4:06:17] be little glass cups. You be sure if you
[4:06:20] feel to Don't be condemned. Don't be
[4:06:22] judged. Don't it it's between you and
[4:06:24] the Lord. Nobody has any right to say
[4:06:29] anything or think anything. If you to
[4:06:31] take that little cup, you take it. It's
[4:06:33] there. I filled it up for you if you
[4:06:37] want it. But I receive communion with a
[4:06:40] common cup and I serve it with a common
[4:06:44] cup. And God has been good to us.
[4:06:48] &gt;&gt; There was a period of time where there
[4:06:50] was a sister who worshiped with us who
[4:06:52] had been diagnosed with hepatitis C.
[4:06:56] We knew it. She knew it. I even went to
[4:06:58] one of the doctor's appointments.
[4:07:01] So I knew that it was the case from her
[4:07:04] years of
[4:07:06] needle abuse.
[4:07:09] In that moment, there was a challenge.
[4:07:12] What will we do? What will we do? What
[4:07:14] will we do? And we decided to continue
[4:07:17] on doing it as we had always done it
[4:07:19] before.
[4:07:22] Was she allowed to take communion? Are
[4:07:24] you kidding me? She needed it. She
[4:07:26] needed it more than most of us.
[4:07:30] It's possible that the first time I may
[4:07:32] have had a little towel and I may have
[4:07:35] done that to few few people come
[4:07:38] through. I think I might have. I don't
[4:07:40] remember. But I I want you to know that
[4:07:42] don't do much,
[4:07:45] make you feel better.
[4:07:50] Brother Brandham said there's divine
[4:07:52] healing in communion.
[4:07:55] &gt;&gt; And I I just believe it when we pray
[4:07:58] over that. I just believe. But I want
[4:08:01] you to do as you feel. It'll be there
[4:08:03] for you. And I mean this now. If I hear
[4:08:08] of one person saying anything negative
[4:08:12] about somebody who took that little cup,
[4:08:15] you're going to get a tongue lashing
[4:08:19] from me
[4:08:21] because that would not be right.
[4:08:24] You come with your conviction. You take
[4:08:27] whichever you feel and don't find it
[4:08:30] necessary to comment, to grunt.
[4:08:38] &gt;&gt; I think some of you know I mean it.
[4:08:40] &gt;&gt; Don't grunt. Don't gasp. Don't just say,
[4:08:44] "Praise God. They're they're taking the
[4:08:48] wine."
[4:08:49] &gt;&gt; Don't ever let it bother you a bit. I
[4:08:52] don't know how long we will do that, but
[4:08:53] this evening we will. it'll be there.
[4:08:57] So, if you're baptized in the name of
[4:08:59] the Lord Jesus Christ, if you have
[4:09:02] active uh sin, if you're you are
[4:09:05] participating, you're gambling, Brother
[4:09:07] Brandham specifically mentioned some of
[4:09:09] those things, if you're involved in
[4:09:11] those kinds of things, please do your
[4:09:14] best to to repent, get that right, and
[4:09:17] make up your mind you're bigger than
[4:09:19] that by the grace of God. Yeah.
[4:09:21] &gt;&gt; Don't come through and take it and just
[4:09:25] say, "Well, I'm going to just throw
[4:09:26] myself on the mercies of God." You're on
[4:09:28] the mercies of God. Now,
[4:09:32] &gt;&gt; you tempt him,
[4:09:37] then you are discerning his body
[4:09:39] unworthily. You're taking that
[4:09:40] unworthily, not properly discerning his
[4:09:43] body. And the Bible said scripture 1
[4:09:46] Corinthians 11, brother Brandham
[4:09:49] really expounds on it multiple times.
[4:09:52] You many are sick among you for that
[4:09:54] reason and some sleep. And I don't think
[4:09:58] that applies to you nap takers in
[4:10:00] church.
[4:10:02] &gt;&gt; I think that means a little more than
[4:10:03] that. I don't believe in trying to make
[4:10:06] people fearful. But the very reason why
[4:10:08] it's been five years is because when it
[4:10:11] becomes common,
[4:10:13] people will walk through,
[4:10:17] strut their shoulders,
[4:10:19] and not even think about what they're
[4:10:21] doing,
[4:10:23] and it means nothing. Brother Brandham
[4:10:25] said, "You've made it a tradition." I
[4:10:27] found a quote where Brother Brandham
[4:10:29] said, "I don't even believe in in in
[4:10:31] saying I'm going to do it the second
[4:10:33] Sunday or the first Sunday."
[4:10:36] He said, "When you do that, you've made
[4:10:38] it a tradition.
[4:10:41] &gt;&gt; It should be of greater importance and
[4:10:45] deeper value than that." Do you
[4:10:46] understand?
[4:10:48] &gt;&gt; If you're waiting to feel perfect or
[4:10:50] feel worthy or feel righteous,
[4:10:54] you'll wait another five years and and
[4:10:56] beyond.
[4:10:58] But if you will put your hand, here's
[4:11:00] the key. Put your hand on the head of
[4:11:03] your lamb.
[4:11:05] [Laughter]
[4:11:12] and have fellowship with your sacrifice
[4:11:16] and say, "Lord, I ought to crawl on my
[4:11:19] belly through the line. But because you
[4:11:23] paid the price,
[4:11:25] &gt;&gt; I'm going to take and I'm going to
[4:11:28] believe that it'll be a turning point in
[4:11:30] my life."
[4:11:32] &gt;&gt; Let's come back.
[4:11:34] 6 o'clock,
[4:11:37] you're dismissed to go in the name of
[4:11:38] the Lord. If you have a question, an
[4:11:41] important question concerning the
[4:11:44] communion service, I will sit here just
[4:11:46] a few minutes before I go out. Once I go
[4:11:49] out, I'm out.
[4:11:51] But I'll sit here for just a few
[4:11:52] minutes. I believe that many of you have
[4:11:55] made a fresh start with the Lord, and I
[4:11:57] believe you're going to feel and see the
[4:11:59] difference.
[4:12:00] &gt;&gt; Please love on our visitors.
[4:12:03] So glad some of them would get to
[4:12:05] worship with us a night or two this
[4:12:06] week. Tonight at 6, just stay right
[4:12:10] there, darling. Stay right there, Nora.
[4:12:12] I'm coming down. Stay right there.
[4:12:16] Tonight at 6,
[4:12:18] Tuesday night at 7 o'clock, we start.
[4:12:20] God bless you as you leave this evening.
