TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the Bible literally says he became sin it it it means what it says he not only took on our sin but he was transfigured transformed into our sin it's powerful it's huge if I could think of how that Jesus when he died he went and preached to the souls that were in prison he died a sinner knowing no sin amazing because the sin wasn't in the Inner Man the sin was on his flesh and God for his sins sent him to hell oh he couldn't bypass it he died a sinner his flesh but I want you to know that it was a big mistake if the enemy thought he had won it was a huge mistake cuz what did Jesus do the Bible said he descended Into the Heart of the Earth or to the lower parts a and what did he do he led captivity captive talk about messing up a prison he took the prison as a prison he took a prison as a prisoner you're now under my control for a few moments the Bible said as he descended Into the Heart of the earth he led captivity captive and what else did he do he gave gifts unto men now that's a powerful transaction that took place in the Realms of Darkness now we have come to understand because we see Jesus in Revelation chapter 19 as a Victorious conquering Lord riding a what a white horse on on the on the girdle The Binding of His Garment he's wearing keys and what were they the keys of death hell and the grave powerful now how in the world did he get the keys of death hell and the grave they didn't fall out of out of the sky he had to go get them imagine that he took the very prison of hell as a prisoner and he took from Satan the keys of death hell and the grave our enemy doesn't even hold the keys to his own front door powerful now he not only did that he made a whistle stop because there was a time under the old Covenant that the that the righteous dead those who died in the instruction those who died in the Torah they were held in A Place Called Paradise because the blood of Jesus had not been shed well now he shed his blood his body is laying in a grave the inner man has descended the body still laying there lifeless the real Jesus the Inner Man the word has now descended Into the Heart of the earth he has not only taken the keys of death hell and the grave and so what this says to us is the devil can't take you to hell if if any body under the sound of my voice goes to hell it's not because Satan took you prisoner and drugg you there he doesn't even have the key he has no Authority in his own house so if you go it's because you made a willful decision to get there Jesus made a way to get you out
