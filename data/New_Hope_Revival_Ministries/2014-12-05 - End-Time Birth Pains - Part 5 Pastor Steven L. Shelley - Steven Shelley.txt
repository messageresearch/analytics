TRANSCRIPT
========================================
thank you foreign hello I'm Pastor Stephen Shelley and I want to welcome you to the Eagles cry broadcast I'm coming to you from the New Hope Revival ministries in Smith Station Alabama United States of America I don't know where you are around the world but I want to say what a great privilege it is for me to be able to speak to you today in the mighty name of our Messiah the Lord Jesus Christ it is a real joy to be living in the hour that we're living in knowing that we are approaching the coming of the kingdom of God to this earth and things are dark there's no doubt about it I'm not going to pretend like things are not bad around us the enemy is Raging heathens are raging like the scripture says but it's time for the bride of Christ to arise and shine and let the light of the Glorious gospel be reflected in our lives and that's part of the Mandate on the Eagles cry I truly believe that God is sending a message a revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ that will help prepare and position a true elect bride a remnant bride those who will not be satisfied with meager church annity or the trappings and icons of religion but those who desire to lean on the Lord's chest to put our ear to his chest Desiring to hear the heartbeat of God I want to know what he is concerned about in this hour I want to know what he loves I I want to discover what he hates I want to know everything there is to know about the Lord and I remember hearing one time a man of God a prophet of God brother William Branham who left the scene in 1960 65 but I want to thank God for the grace that he has given us to be able to preserve many of his sermons and they are recorded in digital format and print format you can listen to them stream them over the internet and so forth and I remember hearing him say in in one of his sermons so so many wonderful things about the nature of God and one comes to my mind right now he said that God is so big and so multifaceted so holy so powerful there's so much that we don't know about him that he would continue to reveal himself to us throughout all eternity can you imagine God being so multifaceted his personality being so vast his attributes being so many so new numerous that it would take Eternity for him to reveal himself to us layer by layer like pulling the skin and the layers off of an onion God continually unfolding and unveiling himself if there were no other reason to know that you're redeemed to know that when you leave this earth you're going into the presence of the Lord that would be reason enough I want to thank you for contacting our ministry the New Hope Revival ministries we try to give you the contact information every week on the broadcast our website is revival.org that's revival.org you can go on and look at some of the resources that we have available for sale I know that you would be blessed and when you purchase some of those Ministry items you are a real blessing to us that's one of the ways that we're able to maintain the small staff that we have I I kid with all of them because really the the small amount of money that they receive they're really on a volunteer basis but if you Avail yourself of some of those resources it would be a great blessing to our ministry and to our staff we want to be faithful to pray with you over your prayer request I believe in the power of prayer and I dedicate cated my life to the Lord many many years ago in 1975 I gave him my whole life and and surrendered to the call of ministry as a seven-year-old boy and I committed myself to be an intercessor to pray for the saints of God and you know people say well you've been here and you've been in so many countries and you've done this and you've done that but but I want to say that the greatest privilege and perhaps the greatest accomplishment of my Ministry has been the time that I've spent in prayer on behalf of the people of God all over the world and so we are deeply committed to pray for your prayer request send them by email by letter or by phone call we would be more than happy to hear from you and I assure you that your prayer request will not find its way to the garbage bin but it will be seriously held before the Lord we even have people who send in their prayer requests and weeks later send back a testimony to say God answers prayer God delivers again and we have had amazing Miracles take place in people's bodies and in their lives salvations deliverances people baptized with the Holy Ghost healed from all manner of incurable diseases because Hebrews 13 and 8 is our theme Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah the same yesterday and today and forever guess what that means he will not change it also means that if he ever healed the sick body a sick body he is still able to heal the sick today if he ever saved a lost soul or delivered someone from the oppression of the enemy he is still able to do that today so what we read about him doing in the four gospels and what we read about him doing through the apostles in the book of Acts I want you to know I believe with my whole being he is still doing those very same things today I want you to pray for the fine Christian networks who are airing the Eagle's cry the gospel channel and Angel TV pray that God will continue to prosper them and expand them as he is positioning those networks to be Mighty instruments of his glory in the last days and those men and women of God need our prayers as they make decisions as they commit to expanding the networks so that we can reach more people with the with the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ and both of those networks are streaming on the internet which is added expense but it certainly expands the Outreach of the broadcasts that are on those fine Christian networks so let's be faithful to pray now let's continue our Series today on the birth pangs of the Messiah or the coming of the Lord what we would sometimes refer to as the second coming of the Lord I I made clear to you in an earlier broadcast that I do believe that there is a resurrection Rapture for the bride of Christ that will it will absolutely take place before the great wrath when I say the great wrath I mean the last three and a half years of the tribulation period where the where the most harsh events are going to take place as God seeks to purify and cleanse the Earth and then after that is that amazing one thousand year Millennial reign of Peace where the prince of peace SAR Shalom will come and sit on the throne of his father David and talk about an amazing thing the scripture said he will sit in the millennial Temple the temple that Ezekiel Saw sitting once again on the Holy Mountain of Moriah and from that Temple our Messiah will sit and teach the Nations so I talk about a thousand year seminar I it just doesn't get any better than that when you sit at the feet of the Savior the King of Kings and the Lord of lords and learn all of the wonderful truths that he wants to share with his bride with his elect during that time of Peace it's going to be an amazing event somebody said some skeptic you know said well it sounds like a fairy tale well it may sound like a fairy tale to you but I find it in the word of God God and I believe that this word of God is the absolute truth and I believe that God wants to give us deeper Revelation in this hour of of the scripture so that we can we can sort of filter out traditional teaching the things that we've been that we've believed just because it was passed down to us from generation to generation and asked that the Holy Ghost would come anointing our eyes with ice ABS so that we could see the reality of the truth of God's word minus uh the traditions of man and all of the different um you know Slants and dogmas and Creeds and uh whatever else you might you might want to call it it's just according to how plain we want to get you know uh the just shall live by faith don't forget that we're not here on planet Earth paying for our sin let me tell you something our sin did debt has been settled by the Precious Blood of the sacrificial lamb Our Redeemer the Lord Jesus Christ and so it is no longer necessary for us to try to to appease God or to make some sort of sacrifice for our own sins um you know with Penance let's just say it that way with Penance we're no longer having to to repeat some magic words or or climb the steps of the Cathedral on our knees or something like that because the just shall live by faith the sin dead is paid when you've been Justified it is just if I'd never sinned and we're daily being Washed by the Water of the word that's the sanctifying process whereby we're cleansed and then we're empowered with the Holy Ghost and when the spirit of God when the Holy Ghost comes and lives inside of us it it puts that go ye in us it's the Zeal for the things of the Lord and and it's hard to contain ourselves sometime you know I get so angry at the Devil when I see his attempt to steal the joy of the saints of God and I mean there are a lot of people moving uh in in this life without joy and I'm telling you you need Joy because the joy of the Lord is your strength and somebody said well you know how can I have joy I've got cancer my my son is on drugs I have all of these different adverse circumstances going on in my life well I want you to know if there ever was a time to tap into the joy of the Lord that's the time you want to do it Paul and Silas beaten bleeding dripping bruised in the Roman jail and at the Midnight Hour they lifted up their hands and they begin to sing the high praises of God God the the joy of the Lord began to well up in their spirit and guess what happened God shook the jailhouse talk about Jailhouse Rock the whole jail began to shake and God delivered his holy men out of that prison and so whatever prison you're in today the joy of the Lord that's released in sincere praise and worship can be an amazing tool to bring you to that place of Joy where the jailhouse shakes the bars break and you have freedom you know the Bible said he whom the son sets free it's not just free we are free indeed I want you to know you're free indeed if you've been set free by the power of God now we've been talking about these birth pains and we've been counting them down this is the Fifth Fifth program in this series we've been counting them down backward from 10 down to one and number 10 is signs in the sun and the moon and the stars as Jesus speaks about in both Matthew 24 and in Luke 21 and then we've covered that pretty good and then we started talking about the the prediction that there would be violence upon the whole earth Luke 17 26 tells us that exactly the way it was in the days of Noah that's how it's going to be in the days of the coming of the son of man so we go to Genesis 6 and we discover just how it was in the days of Noah and we can certainly say that violence unprecedented violence it seems is is breaking out all over the world where people have no regard for the sanctity of human life for innocent women and children and people are willing to commit themselves to their ideologies to the extent of committing Sue suicide and wiping out dozens or hundreds of innocent people this is the kind of world that we're living in now and it tells us that we are in the birth pangs of the Messiah and as we have pointed out in the prior broadcast uh the reason why Jesus chose this analogy of a woman in travail of Labor is those contractions start mild and they are uh substantially apart there's quite a quite a distance between those contractions when labor is just in the onset stage but when it begins to transition into a heavier kind of Labor then those pains grow more intense and they grow more frequent so what we're seeing right now in 2013 is we're seeing a an increase in the frequency of these birth pains on the planet and and in the intensity and that's not going to stop or slow down now it's only going to continue to grow and so violence is going to continue to fill the whole earth and that's why we need a bomb shelter and I'm not talking about necessarily a hole in the ground we we have Psalm 91 we have the promise that we can find our safety under the shadow of the wings of the almighty I'm telling you that's a good place to hide let him cover you with his feathers let him wrap you up in his wings is the analogy that the psalmist David gave and it'll work for me I long to be wrapped up in his care and in his protection and and as I have traveled the nations of the world for all of these 30 plus years I've needed his wings and let me tell you my personal testimony is he is sufficient I've been on I've been on airplanes across Africa with with holes in the fuselage that would drop hundreds of feet at a time I've been in places where mobs were coming to kill us I have ran literally run for my life because we were being pursued in a foreign country and I have seen the hand of God take care of us time and time again you know there's no greater life than serving God that there is no greater life and I I'm relatively a young man 44 years old but I've given the Lord my entire life since I was at since I was seven years old and so I've got a lot of years of ministry and I want you to know I don't regret a mile I don't regret one mile but I've traveled for the Lord I don't regret one time that I've made any amount of sacrifice and I don't want to indicate that my sacrifices have been huge in comparison to to some people I haven't had to sacrifice advice much at all but I want you to know anything I've had to give up to follow Jesus Christ I would give it up again I would gladly lay it down there is no other life other than serving him and I don't know why I'm taking time to say these kinds of things today except perhaps that the Lord is having me to speak to somebody's heart who feels discouraged who feels like you can't go on I want you to know that I'm asking the Lord even now to send the power of the Holy Spirit to let his presence hover around you and settle down over you right now bringing a calmness to both your soul and your spirit and I'm asking that your body created by God began to line up in even the systems of your body right now line up in the authority of Jesus Christ with the plan of the Creator so that you can begin to walk in health and I'm praying right now and just sort of releasing this anointing right now for people who are dealing with heavy anxiety even panic attacks and what what we would call nervous spells and that awful confession keeps coming out of your mouth I'm losing my mind you need to quit saying that you need to stop saying that quit prophesying your own condition and begin to declare by the word of the Lord with his stripes I am healed and begin to prophesy into the atmosphere the scripture promise that says I will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on me put your mind and your affection and your attention and your focus on the Lord and let him give you the strength that you need to look away from your present circumstances right now and look to him you perhaps are even on medication uh for for the condition that you're going through right now and I encourage you not to be condemned by the fact that you need medication but I'm asking the Lord to heal you I'm asking the Lord to deliver you and to eventually bring you to a place with some proper monitoring and care and some accountability that maybe you don't have to depend on those things but don't you let the enemy condemn you because you've reached out to try to get help and that has required some medication uh you do what you need to do for now but I'm asking the Lord to give you freedom and victory I guarantee you that I'm speaking into people's lives right now who are watching this broadcast ordered of the Lord for you to have some hope and and God God wants us to be filled with hope and of course the enemy wants us to be hopeless and so we're we're not going to satisfy the enemy we're going going to put our hope and our trust in the Lord so there is going to be violence on the Earth but we have an Ark of Safety we have a place of shelter underneath us or the Everlasting Arms of God and then number eight we talked about last week famines pestilences and earthquakes and we took that from Matthew chapter 24 verse 7 and Luke chapter 21 verse 11 where it talks about I even gave you some statistics about how that there are many more earthquakes 8.0 and above when you average it out according to decade I noticed that the U.S Geological Survey was averaging it out for for 50 60 70 years at a time and so it doesn't look like there's been that much increase when you break it down into decades you can see that it has been an amazing increase in earthquake Quakes and especially the deaths in fact from in in from the year 2000 to the year 2009 uh we have seen almost a quadruple in the amount of deaths caused by earthquakes and so these things are going to continue and our hope and our confidence needs to be in the Lord and not in in you know natural uh protection and what we see these things are not going to cease they're going to continue and and so what we need to do is just draw up real close to the Lord just get as close to him as you possibly can and let God use you to spread the light of God of the gospel and he'll take care of us and like I said it in the broadcast last week look if if it takes me you know if if uh if if I fall victim to a natural disaster a hurricane or or Earth earthquake listen God knew that from the beginning it wasn't a mistake and I'll tell you this to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord I'm like you I want to live as long as I can I want to continue to raise my four beautiful children I want to continue to to live and and peace with and happiness and enjoy my wife I want to keep enjoying the ministry and but listen if he calls me I know where I am and there's no greater peace in all the world than being able to lay your head on the pillow at night and know that you're ready to meet God I want to get to number seven quickly we'll have to cover it in in Greater detail in next week's broadcast but number seven in our countdown of the birth Pains of the Messiah is that Nations will be in distress with perplexity that is in Luke chapter 21 and verse 25 Jesus is speaking and he said and there shall be signs and upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring and so uh we can say that this is already definitely full swing the nations are in distress with great perplexity now that word perplexity means without understanding confusion and and when we look at the world situation what's going on and uh with with uh different leaders in different nations and regimes being raised up we're living in an hour right now where uh there is a nation in the world more than one where a leader the leader of the nation is massacring murdering his own people and and it must produce a a tremendous amount of distress and perplexity and confusion in people's minds as they fear for their life many of them not knowing that they have hope by trusting in the Lord Jesus so we want to pray for Nations like Syria and many many others in Egypt and other places where there is uprisings it is a definite sign of The Nearness of the coming of the Lord and unfortunately it's going to continue to to be that way and I think again it's going to grow in frequency and in intensity so we want to pray for the Nations if you are a Spirit-filled believer an intercessor uh you can pray for the nations of the world my prayer for the Nations is is uh not as much about peace as it is about salvation I want to see people saved I don't want people to die lost I want them to be prepared to meet God I want the gospel to be able to penetrate uh every lie and every regime and every false religion that tries to keep the truth at bay that's what I want to see and you say well I'm just a little a little lady living here in England or I'm I'm just a brother here in Scandinavia or or whatever and I'm I I have no influence over the Nations let me tell you Satan trembles all of Hell shakes when the weakest Christian gets down on their knees and begins to call on the name of the Living God and so you can do a whole lot more damage to the kingdom of darkness than you realize eyes in your prayer and you can accomplish some pretty spectacular things when you pray in the spirit I want to pray for you right now father I thank you for every person watching the Eagles cry right now I believe many of them are sitting there uh By Appointment I believe you've called them to watch this program on this particular day and I am decreeing and declaring in the in the authority of God that depression and anxiety and panic attacks and nervousness flee the children of God right now Lord I'm praying specifically for a mother who is so troubled for her son who is in an institution who is in terrible shape and she is a child of God a woman of God and she is holding on to you Lord I'm asking you to bring Deliverance to that son and comfort to that mother and hundreds of other sons and hundreds and thousands of other mothers who stand in need of a mighty salvation in the lives of their children Lord I agree right now and release your healing power in the wonderful name of our Messiah Yeshua we pray amen thank you for watching the Eagles cry please tune in again for the next broadcast I really appreciate you watching bye bye for now foreign foreign
