[51:12] home till late last night but uh must
[51:14] have been Friday he sent a text and said
[51:17] if you need me for anything this weekend
[51:19] I just wanted you to know well at that
[51:22] very moment I was just feeling a little
[51:25] overwhelmed and I said Lord so many are
[51:28] away and most of the ones who help us
[51:31] with those kinds of problems are gone
[51:33] this weekend and I'm just asking you to
[51:36] help us somehow and that text came
[51:39] and brother Steve poke I don't want to
[51:42] pick on folks but he called and he said
[51:45] I just want you to know I'm here brother
[51:47] Shelley I appreciated that and I know
[51:50] that every one of you brothers would
[51:51] have been but God let those calls come
[51:54] and those texts come when you're feeling
[51:55] a little I like it you know it would
[51:58] have meant something anytime but it sure
[52:01] did mean something to me we have a lot
[52:03] to pray about this morning but we don't
[52:05] have to worry about it because God is on
[52:08] the throne we want to continue to
[52:10] remember your sister Royale my royal
[52:14] jelly we want you to ask the Lord to
[52:17] completely heal her and restore her and
[52:21] we understand that there's a possibility
[52:23] that she is streaming the service this
[52:25] morning and if you are oops
[52:29] a little choked if you are we want to
[52:32] say how much we look why don't you all
[52:34] turn around and wave and if there's if
[52:37] she didn't get to see it if the nurse
[52:39] was in or something then Mary Bethel
[52:41] make sure she sees it at some point we
[52:44] send you our love and there's been a lot
[52:46] of prayers going up for her this week
[52:48] and God has moved and there are many
[52:51] things that are yet to be determined for
[52:54] her Rehabilitation and her care but we
[52:58] know that God's got the perfect place
[53:00] he's got the perfect helpers he's got
[53:02] the the perfect situation already in his
[53:06] mind he is not scrambling
[53:09] I understand all the doctors and
[53:11] Specialists are getting together to try
[53:13] to agree and come up with a plan but you
[53:15] know God is Not scrambling he doesn't
[53:18] have Glory he doesn't have to make any
[53:20] calls to consult with anyone else
[53:23] he knows exactly what is best and how to
[53:27] bring it to pass and so we want to lift
[53:29] her up to the Lord and Molly and her son
[53:32] are there mirabeth has been there this
[53:35] week and uh to as a great sacrifice but
[53:38] but that's where her heart wanted to be
[53:40] and we want to pray for her today it's
[53:42] good to be able to see her and to know
[53:45] that she is well and uh we're just
[53:48] believing every detail of that to fall
[53:51] into place this week uh sister Teresa is
[53:54] home with a fever not feeling well we
[53:56] want to hold her up to the Lord in
[53:58] prayer also Tiffany texted to say that
[54:02] her little girl is sick this morning and
[54:04] needs to be Hannah needs to be
[54:06] remembered to the Lord in prayer that
[54:08] God would help her and I understand that
[54:12] all of Zach's kids are sick this morning
[54:14] all three of them they need to be
[54:16] remembered high fevers and so forth and
[54:19] need to be remembered and if I know Liz
[54:21] she needs to be prayed for too
[54:24] so let's lift her up to the Lord she's
[54:26] at home taking care of sick babies
[54:29] um I don't know Sister Alfred has not
[54:32] been well this week but she's pushed her
[54:34] way through and is here this morning
[54:36] let's ask the Lord to help her I haven't
[54:38] heard anything from Sister Flo she's not
[54:40] feeling well so let's lift her up to God
[54:42] those who are traveling that the Lord
[54:46] will be with them we miss the greeleys
[54:48] and we ask the Lord to help them he was
[54:50] to preach for his dad today but the the
[54:53] scold and the snow and the ice have
[54:56] fixed that and there's no service there
[54:58] today but we just pray for all of those
[55:00] Saints there and I would just suggest if
[55:04] you uh maybe your service was called off
[55:07] for Christmas or maybe it was called off
[55:09] for cold weather but I would just
[55:11] suggest that someone go check the church
[55:15] laughs
[55:17] because when we came in this morning
[55:19] they came into a flood and there was
[55:21] water about halfway out through the
[55:23] vestibule none in the sanctuary praise
[55:25] the Lord bathroom men's bathroom floor
[55:28] flooded and the Blue Room wetter than
[55:30] I've ever seen it we've had two two
[55:32] problems and this one was a little bit
[55:35] deeper with the water but as I said to
[55:38] you before we started service this
[55:39] morning the people the brothers just
[55:41] started showing up sisters to toting a
[55:44] lot of stuff out of there by the way if
[55:46] you have something in there today is a
[55:48] marvelous day to get it we don't want to
[55:51] pick your precious Treasures up and have
[55:53] to take them back in there so why don't
[55:55] you take them home and there's a stack
[55:58] of hexagons that may go in the dumpster
[56:00] if I don't hear from Kendra and uh and
[56:02] uh charity today uh I'm just kidding but
[56:07] if you have something in there that's
[56:09] yours would you come and get them get it
[56:12] see look around coats
[56:14] you know you you probably needed that
[56:16] this weekend and we were storing it for
[56:19] you plates dishes I don't know what all
[56:22] water cups just whatever uh you know
[56:25] it's so funny because when we do this
[56:27] sometimes we put it out in the middle of
[56:29] the floor and people say well I don't
[56:30] have anything I know I don't have
[56:31] anything I know there's nothing of mine
[56:32] in there
[56:33] oh they're passing by oh that looks like
[56:36] my sweater there
[56:38] you know why you forgot it because we've
[56:40] been keeping it so long you forgot it
[56:42] you even had it you you all may discover
[56:44] a new wardrobe so please check the lost
[56:47] and found as you leave today
[56:50] um we want to continue to pray for those
[56:53] who will be traveling home this week and
[56:56] that God will be with them if you were
[56:57] following the The Adventures of Ben and
[57:00] Kendra and their family they left pretty
[57:03] early Friday morning and they got to
[57:05] their location our time after 3 A.M this
[57:09] morning
[57:10] so it took two and a half days
[57:13] what's that oh seven o'clock this
[57:16] morning
[57:17] that is a long two full days sin of
[57:21] travel and they finally made it and I
[57:24] heard that their one of their last
[57:25] episodes there they walked up to the
[57:27] counter and said could you just look and
[57:29] see if there's a way because they're
[57:31] they're uh their new flight had been
[57:33] delayed you know the new one they gave
[57:35] them had been delayed and uh the lady
[57:38] said there's no reason for me to look I
[57:41] have no flight for you going anywhere in
[57:44] the United States there are no flights
[57:46] so if you're already booked on a flight
[57:48] you will have to wait for that flight to
[57:50] eventually leave and that's what they
[57:52] did but God was with them and they made
[57:55] it but let's pray that everyone has a
[57:57] easier time getting back we'll do it
[57:59] this way this morning do you have a

[1:08:59] your faith up there and see he's talking
[1:09:01] about me I'm claiming that that one is
[1:09:03] mine you may be seated a moment and as
[1:09:06] soon as you hit the seat will you clap
[1:09:08] your hands for these musicians and
[1:09:10] worship leaders and
[1:09:12] God bless you all
[1:09:14] right would you all stay here though in
[1:09:16] one more song
[1:09:18] even though we're thankful for you I'm
[1:09:21] supposed to receive the tithe in the
[1:09:23] offering and uh I hope you've come this
[1:09:26] morning to prepare and prepared to sow
[1:09:28] into the work of the Lord he's prepared
[1:09:32] to give back to you pressed down shaken
[1:09:35] together and running over I know this
[1:09:37] doesn't matter to some but I'm really
[1:09:39] supposed to say it uh we are coming to
[1:09:42] the end of the year December 31st is the
[1:09:45] end of the year and if you have any
[1:09:47] giving that you want to count for the
[1:09:50] year 2022 some of you have already
[1:09:52] passed your limit and so you're just
[1:09:54] you're just giving to God because you
[1:09:57] love him and and you just want to help
[1:09:59] and there are others who don't claim
[1:10:01] their their giving and that's perfectly
[1:10:03] fine but I will let you know that as
[1:10:05] long as they allow it I'm going to claim
[1:10:07] mine
[1:10:08] as long as they will let me do it I'm
[1:10:10] going to use mine I appreciate the break
[1:10:12] how long do you think they're going to
[1:10:14] let us give to the church and get it off
[1:10:16] they fight every year to stop it but
[1:10:18] until they do I'm claiming mine you do
[1:10:21] what you want to do if you have anything
[1:10:23] that you want to get in uh before for
[1:10:26] this receipt that will come to you
[1:10:28] before the end of January then you want
[1:10:31] to get it in before December 31st God
[1:10:34] sees your heart and someone said I sure
[1:10:36] appreciated you mentioning the other day
[1:10:38] tithe does need to go in an envelope you
[1:10:40] don't have to put your name on it it can
[1:10:42] be anonymous but it needs to be marked
[1:10:44] tithe and that's for our our purposes
[1:10:47] the way that we handle the finances that
[1:10:49] come in God supplies all of our needs
[1:10:53] that's just who he is so if you have
[1:10:56] something prepared to give let's have a
[1:10:58] Elias to come I think one is enough for
[1:11:01] the number of people that we have not to
[1:11:03] leave Austin out he's all sharp and
[1:11:05] they're ready but let's just have Elias
[1:11:07] and so many are giving online these days
[1:11:11] and we appreciate that as well father
[1:11:13] you see each heart and you see how you
[1:11:17] have blessed and how you have prospered
[1:11:19] each life and now we take that and we
[1:11:22] give to you what belongs to you and we
[1:11:25] take a portion of what is ours and we
[1:11:27] sow that is offering because that's what
[1:11:29] we've been instructed to do and we've
[1:11:31] never regretted Lord I I I've been doing
[1:11:34] this a long time like so many gathered
[1:11:36] with us this morning and I've never
[1:11:38] regretted one penny one dollar that I've
[1:11:42] given to you it's always come back to me
[1:11:45] again and again and again and I thank
[1:11:48] you for it because that's who you are I
[1:11:51] like brother I like what brother Greely
[1:11:53] says Lord I Thank you that you are
[1:11:55] allowing us to keep Covenant with you we
[1:11:58] appreciate that this morning we ask for
[1:12:00] your blessing on The Giver in the name
[1:12:02] of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and a man
[1:12:06] and amen I want us to sing

[1:16:20] phone
[1:16:20] uh if he's not would you ask him to put
[1:16:23] his head back in here
[1:16:25] um we want you to get ready for the word
[1:16:28] this morning
[1:16:29] we are going to turn
[1:16:32] to Romans chapter 10. beginning in verse
[1:16:37] 7.
[1:16:39] I get this text to tell me we're having
[1:16:41] streaming issues
[1:16:43] and uh my response is why am I not
[1:16:47] surprised
[1:16:48] you know it's just it's just par for the
[1:16:51] course
[1:16:52] the enemy's defeated
[1:16:57] Hallelujah
[1:16:59] I'm not Kosher I came in this morning
[1:17:01] and twisted in the eighth light
[1:17:05] that's not the it's not supposed to be
[1:17:07] lit till tonight but it was so
[1:17:09] aggravated with all what folks have been
[1:17:11] going through
[1:17:12] until I just said I'm going to just
[1:17:14] twist it in early
[1:17:18] when I go home I'm gonna lock my candle
[1:17:20] early I think just to say to the enemy
[1:17:24] you're just not going to stop us from
[1:17:27] going on
[1:17:28] we're going to Press On In Praise we're
[1:17:31] going to press on in faith
[1:17:33] amen many many of us have had unusual
[1:17:37] battles this week but Jesus Is the
[1:17:39] Victor and every one of them and we're
[1:17:42] giving him the praise I just wanted to
[1:17:44] say to Hawk uh so you can tell him when
[1:17:47] he's through that if they would use the
[1:17:51] messenger service on our app
[1:17:53] uh that may not be down and let people
[1:17:56] know that we're still up on YouTube if
[1:17:58] he would just put a little note on the
[1:18:00] app
[1:18:01] if you are here Among Us and you have
[1:18:06] our church app
[1:18:07] you should reload your app let it renew
[1:18:11] itself let it update and we have shifted
[1:18:14] back to a messenger service that's uh
[1:18:17] already in our fee so we don't have to
[1:18:19] pay anything extra for it and we are
[1:18:21] going to use it in fact in a few days
[1:18:23] we're going to do away with the other
[1:18:25] youth chat we don't want we don't need
[1:18:27] more and more I've got so many ways for
[1:18:30] people to get me
[1:18:31] and in touch with me and so we're going
[1:18:33] to go back and use our church app that
[1:18:35] God has blessed us with there are
[1:18:37] several groups on there if you don't
[1:18:40] want to be notified turn off your
[1:18:42] notifications but don't complain if
[1:18:44] something happens and you don't know
[1:18:45] about it
[1:18:47] if you've got your notifications turned
[1:18:49] off
[1:18:50] and uh so I I put out one this morning
[1:18:53] asking the brothers to come early if
[1:18:55] they possibly could I realize those who
[1:18:58] sleep until 10 minutes before church
[1:18:59] time they couldn't they couldn't come
[1:19:01] because they're still sleeping
[1:19:03] but those of us who are who get up on
[1:19:05] Sunday morning because the day belongs
[1:19:07] to him and we're getting ready for
[1:19:09] whatever God has for us we had folks
[1:19:11] coming in early and I appreciate that so
[1:19:13] much others didn't see it so let me just
[1:19:15] let you all know that this is going to
[1:19:17] be the main way that we get in touch
[1:19:19] with you
[1:19:20] uh for a service cancellations or for
[1:19:25] floods
[1:19:26] or for maybe just someday because we
[1:19:28] love you and want you to know it that's
[1:19:29] going to be the main way that you're in
[1:19:31] touch with our faith community it's
[1:19:33] through the app so if you don't have it
[1:19:35] you need to get it if you've got a phone
[1:19:38] so old that you can't load it on there
[1:19:40] you need a new phone
[1:19:42] you can do it
[1:19:44] you can get a new one it doesn't have to
[1:19:46] be brand new it doesn't have to be the
[1:19:48] latest bells and whistles
[1:19:51] but you can do better if you need to
[1:19:53] somebody may even have an old one laying
[1:19:56] around somewhere that they would sell
[1:19:58] you for about five bucks or something
[1:20:00] and but we want you to to be in touch
[1:20:02] with us that way uh it's just good to
[1:20:05] know we you know we never know we we
[1:20:07] don't know we don't know
[1:20:09] we don't know what will happen we don't
[1:20:11] know what's coming we've got two years
[1:20:13] of hanging on to Jesus like never before
[1:20:16] and that's what we're going to do is
[1:20:17] hang on to him well we're very happy to
[1:20:20] have Samuel and isaiahkins are with us
[1:20:22] this morning very happy because they
[1:20:25] spent the worship service helping their
[1:20:27] workers they are they're kind of farmers
[1:20:29] you know real cowboys and they jumped in
[1:20:32] and got the work done would you help me
[1:20:34] welcome the Kinser boys and men young
[1:20:36] men
[1:20:39] long time friends of mine
[1:20:42] and I worshiped and preached for their
[1:20:45] daddy their Granddaddy and their
[1:20:47] great-granddaddy so that's that's pretty
[1:20:49] good family history isn't it so we're
[1:20:52] very glad that they've come to be no
[1:20:53] they didn't come for Christmas like
[1:20:55] someone might have suggested they don't
[1:20:57] celebrate Christmas they're one of the
[1:20:59] few families and few churches I know
[1:21:01] that don't have anything to do with that
[1:21:03] if you're waiting for my Christmas
[1:21:05] message let me refer you to the app it
[1:21:08] was preached Saturday night December
[1:21:10] 17th you'll be able to find it there on
[1:21:13] the app that's my my Christmas message
[1:21:16] to you Deuteronomy 30.
[1:21:20] we're gonna go there I told you Romans
[1:21:24] Deuteronomy 30 and verse 14 but the word
[1:21:28] is very near you
[1:21:30] in your mouth
[1:21:32] and in your mind and in your heart so
[1:21:35] that you can do it
[1:21:39] now Romans 10 that was in the Amplified
[1:21:42] Romans 10 verses 7 through 11 or who
[1:21:46] shall descend into the deep that is to
[1:21:50] bring up Christ again from the dead but
[1:21:54] what saith it the word is neither even
[1:21:58] in thy mouth and in thy heart that is
[1:22:01] the word of faith which we preach that
[1:22:06] if Thou shalt confess I'm in verse 9 of
[1:22:10] Romans 10 that if Thou shalt confess
[1:22:13] with thy mouth the Lord Jesus
[1:22:17] I want you to do that I confess with my
[1:22:21] mouth the Lord Jesus
[1:22:24] and Shall Believe in thine heart that
[1:22:27] God hath raised him from the dead Thou
[1:22:31] shalt be saved is there anybody saved
[1:22:34] here this morning
[1:22:35] you believe in your heart that God has
[1:22:38] raised him from the dead
[1:22:40] doesn't say anything about how he got
[1:22:42] here
[1:22:43] in the fullness of time God made sure
[1:22:45] that he showed up but if you will
[1:22:48] confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus
[1:22:52] Christ is not his last name
[1:22:55] Christ lets us know that he is
[1:22:57] identified with the anointing he is the
[1:23:01] anointed one he is the mashiach he is
[1:23:04] the Messiah and if we believe that God
[1:23:08] hath raised him from the dead we are
[1:23:11] saved and we claim that this morning
[1:23:13] verse 10 for with the heart man
[1:23:17] believeth unto righteousness and with
[1:23:20] the mouth confession is made unto
[1:23:24] salvation did you know confession is as
[1:23:28] important as what you believe what comes
[1:23:32] out of your mouth is as important as
[1:23:35] what you believe
[1:23:37] so you've got to confess it confession
[1:23:40] is made unto salvation for the scripture
[1:23:43] saith whosoever believeth on him shall
[1:23:47] not be ashamed you let the world around
[1:23:51] us Rock and reel and toss to and fro but
[1:23:55] we believe in him
[1:23:57] and we'll not be ashamed we don't have
[1:24:00] to be in line for anxiety treatments we
[1:24:04] don't have to be in line for depression
[1:24:06] treatment
[1:24:07] we can get a hold of God and if you
[1:24:10] haven't keep keep pulling keep reaching
[1:24:13] we can get a hold of God and we can have
[1:24:16] wholeness that he has promised us in his
[1:24:18] word amen if you're not there yet you
[1:24:21] just keep doing what you do and keep
[1:24:23] reaching and keep believing because I
[1:24:25] can tell you right up front it is not
[1:24:28] God's will that we depend on those
[1:24:30] things to get through life he wants us
[1:24:33] to be able to depend on him may God help
[1:24:37] us Lord thank you for your word it is
[1:24:40] life to us it is wholeness and it is
[1:24:43] health and it is help and we thank you
[1:24:46] for it in the marvelous name of the Lord
[1:24:49] Jesus Christ and for his glory we say
[1:24:53] amen you may be seated I'd like to have
[1:24:56] at least one of those doors open uh into
[1:24:58] the vestibule please if the if the
[1:25:01] vacuum is off
[1:25:04] now in the message the spoken word is
[1:25:07] the Original Seed paragraph 119.
[1:25:11] we just read this to you recently and uh
[1:25:15] but we it's been a few few Services now
[1:25:18] and so I want to take you back so that
[1:25:21] you will that was the first quote on
[1:25:24] those notes and so they're working to
[1:25:26] pull that up and this is sort of the
[1:25:29] theme of going to try to finish this out
[1:25:31] this morning and and get ready for
[1:25:34] something else on on Tuesday when we
[1:25:37] meet God willing
[1:25:39] my mission this is Brother Branham
[1:25:41] talking my mission that I believe that
[1:25:45] God has called me for
[1:25:47] I have to say some personal things today
[1:25:49] because that's what I told you I do see
[1:25:51] and tell the world
[1:25:53] my mission I believe to the Earth is to
[1:25:57] forerun the coming word
[1:26:02] I I want you to know something that
[1:26:04] strikes me so profound
[1:26:07] so profound because as John the Baptist
[1:26:10] was sent to forerun the first coming of
[1:26:13] the Lord Jesus Christ God had a servant
[1:26:15] set aside and prepared that he might
[1:26:18] forerun the second coming of the Lord
[1:26:20] Jesus Christ if you struggle with the
[1:26:23] fact that God used brother Branham to
[1:26:25] forerun the second coming do you also
[1:26:27] struggle that he used John the Baptist
[1:26:29] to forerun the first coming he's going
[1:26:31] to choose somebody
[1:26:33] he's going to use somebody and you know
[1:26:35] what I'm going to be that somebody for
[1:26:37] my generation and you should too
[1:26:40] because we're we're out of that hour
[1:26:42] where we have one Messenger to an age
[1:26:45] that's Finnish now and now it's a body
[1:26:47] bride it's everyone all hands on deck
[1:26:51] we're not waiting on somebody to take
[1:26:53] the place of a one-man Ministry we're
[1:26:56] waiting on a bride Ministry to begin to
[1:26:58] expand and move forward to take us right
[1:27:01] into a sweep
[1:27:03] that causes the Rapture The Sweep is
[1:27:06] what produces a Rapture because our
[1:27:08] faith gets to such a level that we begin
[1:27:11] to just speak like God speaks and when
[1:27:14] we do that we get an ocean and we call
[1:27:17] with thus saith the Lord we call for the
[1:27:19] resurrection of the Dead
[1:27:21] I'm just telling you what he's saying
[1:27:23] maybe we need to brush up on our seals
[1:27:25] but this is what he told us we have to
[1:27:28] look forward to and I believe we're
[1:27:30] closer to that Hour the full
[1:27:31] manifestation of the adopted sons of God
[1:27:34] than we have ever been before I believe
[1:27:37] the authority is already in our mouths
[1:27:39] to do what we're going to do
[1:27:41] I believe it's already there and we're
[1:27:43] just waiting on the grace and the timing
[1:27:45] of the Lord to exercise what's already
[1:27:48] in us we're not waiting on authority to
[1:27:50] come it's here
[1:27:52] I'll show you that in just a moment he
[1:27:55] goes on to say is to forerun the coming
[1:27:57] word see the coming word which is Christ
[1:28:01] and and not just Christ in any form
[1:28:05] it's not just Christ in any form he
[1:28:08] first came in a physical Corporal body
[1:28:10] corporate body Corporal body excuse me
[1:28:13] he first came in that in that way and
[1:28:16] then he came in the fullness of his word
[1:28:19] and now he is coming in the fullness of
[1:28:22] a bride body so it's Christ's coming but
[1:28:25] not just him coming anyway it's how is
[1:28:28] he coming Christ in him has the
[1:28:30] Millennium and has everything right
[1:28:33] there because he is the word Christ is
[1:28:36] the word I I read this week that the
[1:28:39] that the hymn that has become a
[1:28:42] Christmas Carol the hymn that was
[1:28:44] written Joy to the World originally was
[1:28:47] never written to be used as a Christmas
[1:28:50] carol it was written about the
[1:28:52] millennium
[1:28:54] now in that interesting news doesn't
[1:28:56] matter I I like the words anyway I love
[1:28:59] that I'm not saying uh that I didn't
[1:29:01] like it because it was used as a
[1:29:02] Christmas Carol although most Christmas
[1:29:04] carols were written by Jews I think you
[1:29:06] know that don't you but anyway uh this
[1:29:09] was a song that was originally written
[1:29:11] about the Millennium Joy to the World
[1:29:13] the Lord Has Come
[1:29:15] let Earth receive her King
[1:29:20] think of it
[1:29:21] and that's how it's going to be one of
[1:29:23] these days
[1:29:24] he came the first time and some people
[1:29:27] missed his coming
[1:29:28] he's coming for his bride and some will
[1:29:31] miss his coming but when he comes to set
[1:29:33] up his Millennial Reign no one will miss
[1:29:36] his coming
[1:29:37] everyone will know that King Jesus has
[1:29:40] risen he has arrived on the scene and
[1:29:43] he's ready to finish out the work that
[1:29:45] he was sent to do and called to do amen
[1:29:47] and he's not coming in the Millennium as
[1:29:50] a little weave baby in a Manger in fact
[1:29:52] you'll never see him that way again
[1:29:54] he'll never ever ever be reduced to that
[1:29:57] again the next time you see him he comes
[1:30:00] as king of kings and Lord of lords as
[1:30:03] Lion of the tribe of Judah he has
[1:30:05] fulfilled himself as the Lamb of God and
[1:30:08] he comes as the lion of the tribe of
[1:30:10] Judah the worthy one to take the book
[1:30:12] and to loose the seals thereof so
[1:30:14] brother Branham we we all have our ideas
[1:30:16] and we got lists some of us have 50
[1:30:18] things we think and believe that God
[1:30:20] sent brother Branham to do but I like to
[1:30:22] let him speak for himself he said I
[1:30:24] believe my commission my my purpose is
[1:30:26] to forerun the coming word which is
[1:30:28] Christ now let's let him do that
[1:30:32] let's not allow his coming to be in vain
[1:30:35] let's get a hold of Christ the word
[1:30:37] let's hold on to Christ now let's honor
[1:30:40] the messenger and love him but let's not
[1:30:42] idolize brother Branham brother Brandon
[1:30:45] was a human being and he said himself he
[1:30:48] made many mistakes and we're going to
[1:30:50] allow him that because he was Flesh and
[1:30:52] Blood we're going to get a hold of
[1:30:54] Christ and hold on to him
[1:30:57] because I want you to know there will be
[1:30:59] no no discrepancies in Christ there
[1:31:02] there will be no memory lapses in Christ
[1:31:04] there will be no differentiation between
[1:31:07] what he says and what he does
[1:31:09] you won't have to sort through any of
[1:31:11] that when we're talking about Christ he
[1:31:14] is the worthy one he is the word he is
[1:31:16] the Millennium it's all in him now who
[1:31:19] are you if Christ is the word and the
[1:31:21] word is Christ who are you we found out
[1:31:24] I'm going to review this with you
[1:31:26] quickly before we skip ahead uh
[1:31:28] paragraph 148 of the spoken word is the
[1:31:31] Original Seed the prophet tells us all
[1:31:34] of God's Sons must be the same yes sir
[1:31:37] to be born of the word yes Lord
[1:31:41] somebody said oh I want to be born to
[1:31:43] the word you already were if you ever
[1:31:45] will be
[1:31:46] we are born of the word
[1:31:51] can't take
[1:31:52] spirit it's our origin
[1:31:55] we were born from the spirit we were
[1:31:58] born from the word we can't lose the
[1:32:01] word now we were born of the word we
[1:32:04] can't give away the spirit Hallelujah we
[1:32:08] were born of the spirit it's our origin
[1:32:10] to be born of the word and spirit thus
[1:32:13] what
[1:32:14] read this with me it brings us back to
[1:32:19] the spoken word again
[1:32:21] the word that said let there be light
[1:32:24] boom
[1:32:25] the word that said let the mountains be
[1:32:27] formed boom that spoken word the word
[1:32:31] that said sister Hattie I give you your
[1:32:34] desire
[1:32:36] what is it that you want I give it to
[1:32:40] you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:32:42] that's the spoken word the spoken word
[1:32:45] that said little fishy I give you your
[1:32:50] life that's the spoken word the word
[1:32:53] that said to the storm in Hurricane
[1:32:55] Mountain you cease to blow
[1:32:58] so that we can get out of here unharmed
[1:33:01] that same spoken word is to be in the
[1:33:04] mouth of the Bride that spoken word that
[1:33:08] said before the doctor's hand touches
[1:33:10] her side sister Nita the tumor will
[1:33:14] disappear that spoken word
[1:33:19] Hallelujah five manifestations of the
[1:33:22] spoken word in our day
[1:33:25] to remind us of who God is and to put a
[1:33:30] faith in our heart that that same word
[1:33:32] is for us all of God's Sons must be the
[1:33:37] same yes sir
[1:33:39] to be born of the word and spirit
[1:33:42] brings us back to the spoken word again
[1:33:47] can everyone say Amen like in John 3 see
[1:33:51] to be born of the water and the spirit
[1:33:53] what does it do
[1:33:58] then look what it does it brings you
[1:34:01] right back again are you with me unto
[1:34:05] the place of where you should have been
[1:34:10] I'm gonna read it I'm gonna just have
[1:34:13] fun today
[1:34:14] I'm just gonna read it again I like you
[1:34:18] have fought hell all week long and I'm
[1:34:22] just going to enjoy myself today it
[1:34:26] brings you right back again unto the
[1:34:29] place of where you should have been
[1:34:34] at the beginning
[1:34:37] Hallelujah
[1:34:38] back to the beginning
[1:34:40] you know we who came from Pentecost we
[1:34:43] like to use the quotes where brother
[1:34:45] random sent back to Pentecost back to
[1:34:48] the original Manna I love that I believe
[1:34:50] that I believe that's exactly what the
[1:34:53] church has to come to be exactly what it
[1:34:56] was in the beginning with me
[1:34:58] with me you know what the church was in
[1:35:00] the beginning
[1:35:04] mighty mighty signs and wonders and
[1:35:08] miracles no Christmas
[1:35:11] no Easter
[1:35:13] I said the early church
[1:35:16] see we are we are absolutely contending
[1:35:21] struggling fighting pushing for the
[1:35:26] faith
[1:35:27] that was what
[1:35:29] once delivered to the Saints that's a
[1:35:33] precious truth it's an undefiled truth
[1:35:35] how many of you believe the early church
[1:35:37] was undefiled it certainly was it was
[1:35:40] pure and look what God has done today
[1:35:43] he's brought us right back to the
[1:35:45] original word that the early church
[1:35:46] believed brother random said I'm
[1:35:48] preaching to you exactly what Paul
[1:35:50] preached
[1:35:51] and he said if I preach you anything
[1:35:53] other than what Paul preached I'm in
[1:35:54] trouble
[1:35:56] anybody with me so a lot of people are
[1:35:59] trying to have him to say things that we
[1:36:01] can't trace back to the word
[1:36:03] he took himself all the way back to the
[1:36:05] first church age messenger and said
[1:36:08] you see all I am to do I believe brother
[1:36:10] Greely mentioned this seven I all I am
[1:36:12] to do he said is to tie together the
[1:36:14] Loose Ends that were left throughout all
[1:36:16] the other Church ages how many of you
[1:36:18] are glad that God has tied loose sins
[1:36:20] together in your mind I tell you what
[1:36:22] we're not where we where we used to be
[1:36:24] because God has made things clear that
[1:36:27] didn't used to be clear he wants to but
[1:36:29] listen he doesn't just want to take us
[1:36:30] back to original Pentecost he didn't
[1:36:32] want to just take us back to the early
[1:36:34] church look where he wants to take us
[1:36:36] back to the beginning
[1:36:39] where Adam had authority over creation
[1:36:43] and could say little tree Puck up
[1:36:46] move yourself over here and put yourself
[1:36:48] back down
[1:36:50] that's how Adam tended the garden
[1:36:53] he didn't do it by a shovel he didn't do
[1:36:56] it by gardening knee pads no sorry he
[1:36:59] did it by the word of his mouth you say
[1:37:01] I don't believe there will be anything
[1:37:03] like that to the Millennium then you
[1:37:04] don't believe this message you don't
[1:37:06] believe this word brother random didn't
[1:37:08] say that would only be restored in the
[1:37:10] millennium
[1:37:11] I'll start let's go back and read this
[1:37:13] again all of the sons of God must be the
[1:37:16] same yes sir to be born of the word and
[1:37:19] the spirit brings us back to the spoken
[1:37:22] word again like in John 3 see to be born
[1:37:24] to the water in the spirit what does it
[1:37:26] do then it brings you right back again
[1:37:31] right back again to where sons of God
[1:37:35] right back to where sons of God how many
[1:37:40] of you know you're a son of God
[1:37:42] wait a minute I want to see your hand
[1:37:44] Olivia Ellsworth I want to see your hand
[1:37:47] there you go what a smile she flashed I
[1:37:51] didn't know what she's gonna Flash
[1:37:52] I didn't know she'd flash embarrassment
[1:37:54] or anger or aggravated or what all she
[1:37:56] flashed a smile sons of God hold up your
[1:37:58] hand let me see
[1:38:01] praise the Lord
[1:38:03] now you're awake
[1:38:06] blood flowing again
[1:38:08] that's where we've been restored to
[1:38:11] Hallelujah
[1:38:13] my my my so so that's ever more the
[1:38:16] reason not to look back to a God who
[1:38:18] lived in a Manger
[1:38:20] it's now now to look ahead and see a God
[1:38:23] that lives in his people all right
[1:38:25] spoken word 181 I know I know I keep I'm
[1:38:28] going to jump over in a minute to
[1:38:29] something that we didn't cover but I I
[1:38:31] think we we need to be reminded of these
[1:38:34] things again
[1:38:34] uh 181
[1:38:38] Hallelujah can you see the word takes
[1:38:43] flesh
[1:38:45] David I just saw you and as I saw you I
[1:38:48] remembered that I should have requested
[1:38:49] a prayer for Ashley who is working today
[1:38:52] as a nurse
[1:38:54] and uh has worked many hours
[1:38:57] of late and is expecting a baby may God
[1:39:01] strengthen her
[1:39:02] and and I'll I'll just tell you this uh
[1:39:05] I don't want anybody to miss church for
[1:39:08] their job but if I was sick and I was up
[1:39:11] there in in a hospital room I would be
[1:39:13] so thankful to have an Ashley
[1:39:15] who was available to come and minister
[1:39:17] to me and come and help me and having
[1:39:19] sat in the hospital several days this
[1:39:21] year with my mother and and see the
[1:39:24] different nurses to come in and how worn
[1:39:26] out they are and how I would always try
[1:39:28] to strike up a conversation and most of
[1:39:31] them said I lose my my passion sometime
[1:39:34] and and I have to I have to refocus
[1:39:37] myself but overall I'm I'm glad that
[1:39:40] this is what I've been called to do and
[1:39:42] it is a calling so may God strengthen
[1:39:44] her today paragraph 181 Hallelujah can
[1:39:47] you see the word word takes flesh there
[1:39:49] you are God is going to have a church
[1:39:52] it's going to be born of the word of God
[1:39:55] because it
[1:39:57] [Music]
[1:39:59] that's who you are
[1:40:02] somebody said is that is that
[1:40:03] Blasphemous for me to say that I'm the
[1:40:06] Living Word of God no that's exactly
[1:40:08] what you are an expression of the Living
[1:40:10] Word of God if you were not an
[1:40:12] expression of the Living Word of God you
[1:40:13] wouldn't be here today
[1:40:15] you'd have a hangover
[1:40:18] you'd have had more eggnog last night
[1:40:20] than you needed
[1:40:22] [Music]
[1:40:24] come on now it don't just put inches on
[1:40:27] you a lot of it's spiked isn't it and
[1:40:29] there's a lot of people that are going
[1:40:31] to celebrate the day-to-day half a day
[1:40:33] with a headache because that's what
[1:40:35] these kind of holidays mean to them but
[1:40:37] that's not what it means to us we are
[1:40:39] here today like we will be next Sunday
[1:40:42] and like we will be the next if Jesus
[1:40:44] tarries the Rapture hadn't come and
[1:40:46] caught us away because we understand
[1:40:48] that we are the representation of the
[1:40:51] Living Word of God brother random asks a
[1:40:53] question in his generation I'm asking a
[1:40:56] question in mind do you see it
[1:40:59] do you see it do you see it and then in
[1:41:03] paragraph 277 8 and 9 he said now his
[1:41:07] body his body is to do the same because
[1:41:10] the body is head and body together that
[1:41:13] right if Christ is the head was the word
[1:41:15] his body has to be the same thing as his
[1:41:19] head was
[1:41:20] so what's the body
[1:41:21] what is his body the word
[1:41:25] because the head Christ is the word amen
[1:41:29] are you there he said that right a
[1:41:32] church of the word born of the word
[1:41:33] virgin born from the word not
[1:41:36] denominational now virgin born from the
[1:41:39] word the way the body operates is by the
[1:41:41] head is that right my body can't move
[1:41:44] until my head tells it to move
[1:41:47] all right in the next in in the end of
[1:41:49] that paragraph he said well if my head
[1:41:51] is Christ
[1:41:52] and my body is a denomination
[1:41:57] how's it going to work
[1:41:59] not very well
[1:42:01] how can Purity and a work together
[1:42:04] let me talk to you just a minute about
[1:42:07] the the miracle of Hanukkah
[1:42:12] there are so many miraculous aspects of
[1:42:16] that of that event
[1:42:18] and we have a tendency to focus on the
[1:42:22] fact that that one pot of oil that was
[1:42:25] only to last in the Holy Menorah one day
[1:42:29] miraculously lasted eight days we
[1:42:32] weren't there we know that it is
[1:42:34] sometimes referred to as a legend we're
[1:42:37] not sure if it happened at all but what
[1:42:39] we do know is it sounds just like the
[1:42:41] Lord sounds just like the way God works
[1:42:44] I'll tell you this if God could take
[1:42:46] that little ragtag army and and cause
[1:42:49] them to defeat the Greek army
[1:42:52] who I have told you multiple times came
[1:42:54] against them with with all kinds of
[1:42:56] weapons and Armory and artillery and and
[1:43:00] even uh stomped against them with
[1:43:02] elephants
[1:43:03] and yet God raised up those little
[1:43:05] Jewish men and caused them to if God
[1:43:07] could do that he can take one pot of oil
[1:43:12] and we mentioned last week he did it for
[1:43:14] the little widow woman he multiplied her
[1:43:16] oil but I read an interesting article
[1:43:19] this week that said one of the most
[1:43:21] amazing Miracles is not that one pot of
[1:43:24] oil was multiplied for eight days it was
[1:43:28] the fact that one pot of oil was found
[1:43:30] and considered pure
[1:43:34] did you know that there was plenty of
[1:43:36] oil left in the temple
[1:43:39] plenty of oil there there's no way in
[1:43:42] the world that they would have gotten
[1:43:44] down to one pot of oil there were pots
[1:43:47] of oil everywhere in the storehouses but
[1:43:49] the Greeks did a little research and
[1:43:53] they found out that by defiling the
[1:43:55] temple they defiled the oil
[1:43:58] interesting isn't it and so they were
[1:44:01] they were absolutely Desiring to Stamp
[1:44:04] Out not not Judaism as we know it but if
[1:44:08] you read the article the sister Joyce
[1:44:09] posted they were they were sent out to
[1:44:13] destroy monotheism which is the the
[1:44:16] faith of one God believing there is one
[1:44:19] God I want you to know your very unique
[1:44:21] people today
[1:44:22] because you believe you really believe
[1:44:24] in one God three manifestations but but
[1:44:28] one God hear ye o Israel the Lord God is
[1:44:31] one the Roman Catholic Church doesn't
[1:44:33] believe in one God
[1:44:35] so you're very unique in the fact that
[1:44:37] you believe in one God there are also
[1:44:40] many Jews who claim that they believe in
[1:44:42] one God but if you get to really talking
[1:44:44] about how they understand things you
[1:44:46] will find out that for them he is sort
[1:44:49] of a sort of an idea I want you to know
[1:44:51] God is more than an idea
[1:44:54] he's a living reality
[1:44:57] amen and Muslims they're not quite sure
[1:44:59] who their God is they call him Allah
[1:45:03] but the god that they talk about today
[1:45:05] doesn't even fit the god of their own
[1:45:07] writings
[1:45:09] so they're in great conflict and that
[1:45:11] and most churches are trinitarian by
[1:45:14] nature in Christianity most the majority
[1:45:16] are and so they don't believe in one God
[1:45:19] so you're getting more and more unique
[1:45:21] as the day goes by and they tell us that
[1:45:24] one of the things the Greek General
[1:45:26] hated the most was the fact that the
[1:45:28] Jews were monotheistic and that they
[1:45:30] only believed in one God and he was
[1:45:32] determined to stamp them out and you
[1:45:35] know what they didn't fight it was not
[1:45:37] their idea to fight other religions or
[1:45:40] to annihilate other religions in fact
[1:45:43] the Jews were one of the only groups of
[1:45:45] people in the world that wasn't trying
[1:45:46] to wipe out all the other religions
[1:45:49] you know why because they had confidence
[1:45:51] in their God because they knew he was
[1:45:53] the one true Living God and although
[1:45:55] they hated paganism they didn't spend
[1:45:57] their time trying to end paganism
[1:46:00] they spent their time trying to keep
[1:46:02] paganism out of their Church
[1:46:06] anybody with me
[1:46:08] so God performed a miracle
[1:46:10] because not only was there a pot of oil
[1:46:13] found it was pure
[1:46:15] and the Seal of the high priest had not
[1:46:18] even been broken on it
[1:46:19] wow
[1:46:21] so God hid it
[1:46:24] where he hit it where they found it I
[1:46:26] don't even know but the seal was not
[1:46:28] broken it could not have been used if
[1:46:30] the Seal of the high priest had been
[1:46:32] broken on that oil
[1:46:34] there would have been no problem finding
[1:46:35] oil I want you to know there were Vats
[1:46:37] full of olive oil
[1:46:39] was flowing freely in the land of Israel
[1:46:42] but they had to find some oil that had
[1:46:44] been koshered by the priests that had
[1:46:46] been blessed by the priest and that fit
[1:46:48] the requirements of the law and that had
[1:46:50] the Seal of the high priest only so this
[1:46:52] is a real Miracle the miracle is that in
[1:46:55] the in the in the midst of of oil that
[1:46:59] was not pure
[1:47:01] they were able to find a pot of oil that
[1:47:04] God had preserved
[1:47:06] and kept clean and kept paganism away
[1:47:09] from it
[1:47:11] because the pagans actually went down
[1:47:13] the line and the oil that was stored in
[1:47:15] the temple they went down the line
[1:47:16] popping the seals
[1:47:18] they wanted to do everything they could
[1:47:21] they they forbade circumcision
[1:47:23] they forbid the keeping of the Sabbath
[1:47:26] come on they were forbidding all kinds
[1:47:28] of anything they could do they were
[1:47:30] outlawing anything that had to do with
[1:47:32] the faith of the Jewish people I want to
[1:47:35] tell you something Jesus wasn't against
[1:47:36] tradition either
[1:47:38] there's a lot of people that have this
[1:47:40] idea that Jesus was against tradition he
[1:47:43] was not against tradition in fact he
[1:47:45] kept the tradition of his fathers
[1:47:47] every Passover he kept the tradition of
[1:47:50] his fathers
[1:47:51] God is the one who instituted Passover
[1:47:54] but the fathers are the ones who decided
[1:47:56] how they would celebrate it and he was
[1:47:58] all right with that
[1:48:00] what he what problem he had with
[1:48:02] tradition is this and he would have a
[1:48:04] big problem with the church today
[1:48:06] including the message search he'd have a
[1:48:08] big problem with some of us because what
[1:48:10] he was against is when tradition is so
[1:48:13] so strong that it renders the word of
[1:48:17] God non-effective
[1:48:19] God can't even do what he said he would
[1:48:22] do in his word because tradition has
[1:48:24] taken the place of the absolute
[1:48:27] anybody with me this is how we've always
[1:48:29] done it so for me I celebrate this time
[1:48:34] of the year not to substitute Christmas
[1:48:36] I celebrate this time of the year
[1:48:39] because I feel like Judah Maccabee
[1:48:42] I feel like one of those Brothers I feel
[1:48:46] like one of those men who have been
[1:48:48] called to defend the purity of the word
[1:48:51] and the same God that kept one pot of
[1:48:54] oil hidden
[1:48:56] undefiled so that he could do his job
[1:48:59] that's the same God that's keeping a
[1:49:01] holy Remnant pure
[1:49:02] there is a pure Remnant being kept in
[1:49:05] this world today by the message of the
[1:49:07] hour by the power of the Holy Ghost by
[1:49:09] the absolute truth of God's word he is
[1:49:11] preserving a people that are without
[1:49:13] blemish
[1:49:14] in his eyes
[1:49:16] in his eyes that's what we're working
[1:49:18] toward to be without blemish in his eyes
[1:49:21] all right so anyway I just I just want
[1:49:24] to stick that in because you know I
[1:49:26] don't care if it burned one night never
[1:49:28] burned again it was pure oil that God
[1:49:31] didn't allow the devil to contaminate
[1:49:33] with his filth
[1:49:34] whoa that oil represented one God
[1:49:39] same God that you and I are serving
[1:49:40] today the same God we followed into real
[1:49:43] Christian baptism in the name of the
[1:49:45] Lord Jesus Christ anybody here
[1:49:47] come on now the same God that we
[1:49:50] followed into the true understanding of
[1:49:51] who he is not three pieces of the same
[1:49:54] pie
[1:49:56] not a God that can be divided a God that
[1:49:59] can be recognized in all of his many
[1:50:01] manifestations and offices but at the
[1:50:03] end of the day he's not three he's not
[1:50:05] 13 he's not 24 he's one one Essence one
[1:50:09] God one Spirit are you there
[1:50:11] all right and then in the end the last
[1:50:13] part of 279 the the way the body
[1:50:16] operates is by the head and the head is
[1:50:19] the word the head is the word see that's
[1:50:21] right and that's exactly what he said
[1:50:23] now
[1:50:24] I want you to go uh with me we're
[1:50:28] skipping now a few places we're going to
[1:50:31] the church age book we read a long one
[1:50:33] in the church age book already but we're
[1:50:35] going to read one more long one if
[1:50:37] that's all right we're going to where
[1:50:38] you will see the quote begin with the
[1:50:41] scripture Revelation chapter 3 verse 17
[1:50:44] and 18. and I don't know how you have it
[1:50:46] in your in your notes there but I I put
[1:50:50] it in blue so that you would be able to
[1:50:52] identify it as a scripture but I think
[1:50:54] when you copy well there you go all
[1:50:56] right I Know Thy works
[1:50:58] that thou art neither cold nor hot I
[1:51:01] would that thouard cold or hot so than
[1:51:03] because Thou Art lukewarm and neither
[1:51:05] cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my
[1:51:07] mouth we're going to look at this
[1:51:09] carefully it says that this layout to
[1:51:11] see in church age group is lukewarm
[1:51:14] and I want to say I know that and I
[1:51:16] recognize that to be nothing but the
[1:51:18] truth is there anybody who sees that
[1:51:21] that is the same
[1:51:22] and
[1:51:26] that's not it
[1:51:28] that's the first place go down to the
[1:51:30] second place
[1:51:33] I think that's the first time that's 15
[1:51:35] and 16. go to 17 and 18. Revelation 3 17
[1:51:39] and 18.
[1:51:41] it's uh there it is now you're there
[1:51:43] that's it because thou says I am rich
[1:51:45] and increased with goods and have need
[1:51:48] of nothing and know it's not that thou
[1:51:51] art would you read that wretched
[1:51:53] miserable poor blind and naked he's not
[1:51:57] talking to the world
[1:51:59] he's talking to the church laodicean
[1:52:01] church now remember these are not just
[1:52:03] seven churches in Asia Minor but they
[1:52:06] absolutely carry the characteristics of
[1:52:08] the seven Church ages that can be laid
[1:52:10] across church history and so the world
[1:52:12] right now the church as we know it right
[1:52:15] now is living in the closing hours of
[1:52:17] laodicea and here is the scriptural uh
[1:52:19] description of who she is he goes on to
[1:52:22] say I counsel thee to buy of Me Jesus
[1:52:25] gold tried in the fire that thou mayest
[1:52:28] be rich so your money means nothing
[1:52:32] your Steeples mean nothing
[1:52:34] your stained glass windows mean nothing
[1:52:36] your multi-campus you know uh Ministries
[1:52:40] mean nothing
[1:52:42] you said I want you to come to me and
[1:52:43] buy gold try it in the fire that thou
[1:52:46] mayest be rich and white Riemann that
[1:52:48] thou mayest be clothed and that the
[1:52:50] shame of thy nakedness do not appear and
[1:52:52] anoint thine eyes with what
[1:52:55] I almost said Grease
[1:52:58] I have but brother Branham could
[1:53:01] understand that I save he talked about
[1:53:03] the grease I don't know but
[1:53:05] somebody might could have used that this
[1:53:06] week uh so cold in the Log Cabin where
[1:53:09] brother Branham grew up in the chinking
[1:53:11] in the logs would sometimes dry out and
[1:53:14] fall out and the cold wind would blow
[1:53:16] and he talks about there being snow on
[1:53:19] the blanket on his bed
[1:53:22] waking up with snow on the blanket on
[1:53:24] the bed because it blew through the
[1:53:25] cheek that's cold
[1:53:27] we have nothing to complain about and
[1:53:29] all the little kitties wake up and their
[1:53:31] eyes so matted together does anybody
[1:53:33] even know what that's like their eyes so
[1:53:35] matted together from the cold that they
[1:53:37] couldn't even open their eyes
[1:53:40] so mama would go over to the wood stove
[1:53:42] light the fire pull the grease over
[1:53:44] to the eye of the wood stove heat that
[1:53:47] up and rub that warm grease in their
[1:53:51] eyes until their eyes would would
[1:53:53] unstick and until that that matting that
[1:53:57] was there would be cleaned out and then
[1:53:58] she would would rinse that out of their
[1:54:00] eyes so that they could see and brother
[1:54:02] banham said this is really it reminded
[1:54:04] him of this ice Sav that we need thank
[1:54:06] God for Isaiah
[1:54:09] thank God for Isaiah you see it that's
[1:54:11] why I'm not here this morning asking you
[1:54:13] what you did this time last year
[1:54:16] it doesn't matter to me what you were
[1:54:17] doing this time last year what matters
[1:54:20] to me is that you've allowed the Holy
[1:54:21] Ghost to provide ourselves
[1:54:28] we can't be held accountable for what we
[1:54:30] can't see we have to ask the Lord to
[1:54:33] begin to reveal and I want you to know
[1:54:35] if there's ever been an hour where God's
[1:54:36] going to pull his bride closer
[1:54:38] it ought to be this hour
[1:54:40] and he's not pulling them to a man
[1:54:43] he's not pulling them to a pastor he's
[1:54:46] pulling them closer to his word if you
[1:54:48] believe that same man let's go on with
[1:54:51] the church age quote here he said now
[1:54:52] look at the first phrase of this verse
[1:54:54] because thou sayest see they were
[1:54:57] speaking the church they were talking as
[1:55:00] the mouthpiece of God
[1:55:03] he said this proves exactly what I said
[1:55:05] verses 16 and 17 men but though they say
[1:55:08] it that does not make it right the
[1:55:12] Catholic Church says she speaks for God
[1:55:14] saying she is the assured voice of the
[1:55:17] Lord how many of you know that's just
[1:55:19] not true he said how any people can be
[1:55:22] so spiritually Wicked
[1:55:27] spiritually Wicked it's more than I know
[1:55:30] but they produce oh yes
[1:55:33] but they produce according to the seed
[1:55:37] which is in them you see it's
[1:55:39] manifesting time
[1:55:42] and we know where that seed come from
[1:55:43] don't we the layers laodicean churches
[1:55:46] saying I'm rich increase with good have
[1:55:49] need of nothing
[1:55:51] we treat each other right we don't talk
[1:55:53] about one another we're mission-minded
[1:55:56] Folk
[1:55:57] we've got everything we need
[1:56:03] wealthy in the things of this world
[1:56:06] that's not enough that was her
[1:56:08] self-estimate she looked at herself and
[1:56:10] that is what she saw she said I'm rich
[1:56:13] which means that she is wealthy and the
[1:56:15] things of this world we're going on now
[1:56:18] she is boasting in the face of James 2
[1:56:20] 5-7 hearken my beloved Brethren hath not
[1:56:23] God chose him the poor of this world
[1:56:26] rich in faith Heirs of the Kingdom which
[1:56:28] he had promised to them that love him
[1:56:29] but ye have despised the poor
[1:56:33] you've really despised the poor he said
[1:56:36] do not rich men oppress you
[1:56:38] and draw you before the Judgment seats
[1:56:41] do not they blaspheme that worthy Name
[1:56:43] by which you are called he said now I do
[1:56:46] not suggest that a rich person cannot be
[1:56:48] spiritual but we all know that the word
[1:56:50] says very few are it is the poor that
[1:56:54] predominate in the body of the Church of
[1:56:56] the true church now then if the church
[1:56:59] becomes full of wealth we know only one
[1:57:01] thing Ichabod
[1:57:03] amen
[1:57:05] very interesting isn't it
[1:57:08] see God won't Prosper us who know the
[1:57:11] truth with compromise
[1:57:14] the only way that we'll ever be
[1:57:15] prospered is If We Hold to the word
[1:57:20] so so we see churches prospering out
[1:57:22] there with no Doctrine whatsoever they
[1:57:24] don't even realize that Ichabod has
[1:57:26] already been written over the door the
[1:57:28] spirit of the Lord is already departed
[1:57:29] and the programs were so amazing
[1:57:32] that nobody even knew that Jesus left
[1:57:34] the building
[1:57:36] they're sad he said you can't deny that
[1:57:39] for that is the word talk about wealth
[1:57:41] in the church why there never has been
[1:57:43] such a show of wealth the beautiful
[1:57:45] sanctuaries are multiplied in number as
[1:57:48] never before why why churches today are
[1:57:50] like cities
[1:57:52] they're like old towns the various
[1:57:55] groups said the man that God has given
[1:57:57] 60 plus acres aren't we blessed
[1:58:00] the various groups Vie with each other
[1:58:02] to see who can build the biggest and the
[1:58:03] loveliest and they build education
[1:58:05] Sinners worth unestimated millions and
[1:58:07] those buildings are used only an hour to
[1:58:09] a week
[1:58:10] now that would not be such a terrible
[1:58:13] thing but they expect this little time
[1:58:15] spent by the children in the education
[1:58:17] plan to take the place of the hours of
[1:58:19] training supposed to be given in the
[1:58:21] home
[1:58:21] [Music]
[1:58:23] I tell you that's an indictment
[1:58:26] because brother Branham is talking about
[1:58:27] a generation who turns their children
[1:58:29] over to the church expecting Sunday
[1:58:31] school to train them for life
[1:58:34] it's not enough
[1:58:36] cookies and Kool-Aid and coloring a
[1:58:40] Jesus picture and singing Jesus loves
[1:58:43] all the little children that's not going
[1:58:44] to be enough to get those children ready
[1:58:46] to live life
[1:58:47] oh no that's Mom and Daddy's place
[1:58:50] money is poured into the church until
[1:58:52] different denominations own stocks and
[1:58:55] bonds factories oil wells and insurance
[1:58:58] companies
[1:58:59] they've poured money into welfare and
[1:59:01] retirement funds now this sounds good
[1:59:03] but it has become a snare to the
[1:59:06] ministers
[1:59:09] for if they decide to leave anybody's
[1:59:11] offended that I have 3 550 in retirement
[1:59:14] account please come see me and I'll take
[1:59:16] it out
[1:59:17] that's what I have 3 550 if that if that
[1:59:21] disqualifies me from the ministry let me
[1:59:23] know
[1:59:24] and we'll all go eat a steak
[1:59:26] all right
[1:59:28] for if they decide to leave their group
[1:59:30] for more light or the love of God
[1:59:33] to them
[1:59:35] stand this and stay with their
[1:59:44] well if we take a stand about that who
[1:59:46] will preach our camp meeting
[1:59:48] if we make a stand against that who who
[1:59:50] will come into our youth camp
[1:59:52] now don't forget that that is that this
[1:59:54] is the last age we know that this is the
[1:59:57] last age because Israel has gone back to
[2:00:00] its Homeland I'm not going to say back
[2:00:02] to Palestine
[2:00:03] because that's not what I believe it
[2:00:05] should ever be called if we believe that
[2:00:08] he really is coming then there must be
[2:00:11] something wrong with those who are
[2:00:12] building so vastly it makes one think
[2:00:15] that these people plan on staying here
[2:00:16] forever do you realize this was in the
[2:00:18] 60s
[2:00:20] are that the coming of Jesus is hundreds
[2:00:23] of years off
[2:00:24] that's kind of how they live do you know
[2:00:27] that Religion Today is known as Big
[2:00:28] Business it is an absolute fact that
[2:00:31] they are placing business managers in
[2:00:33] the churches to take care of Finance
[2:00:35] this is 60s
[2:00:37] is this what God desires did not his
[2:00:40] word teach us in the book of Acts that
[2:00:42] seven Men full of the Holy Ghost and
[2:00:44] Faith serve the Lord in business matters
[2:00:47] you can surely see why God said you say
[2:00:49] you are wealthy I never said so there
[2:00:52] are radio programs television programs
[2:00:54] and numerous Church Endeavors that are
[2:00:56] costing millions and millions of dollars
[2:00:58] wealth Pours and pours into the church
[2:01:00] the membership increases along with the
[2:01:02] money yet the work is not being done as
[2:01:04] it was done when there was no money but
[2:01:06] men rested solely on the ability given
[2:01:08] to them by the Holy
[2:01:11] Ghost powerful powerful powerful there
[2:01:15] are paid preachers paid assistance paid
[2:01:17] Ministers of music and education paid
[2:01:20] choirs paid custodians programs
[2:01:22] entertainment oh costing great sums for
[2:01:27] all that the power is decreasing
[2:01:30] yes the church is Rich but the power is
[2:01:33] not there God moves by his Spirit God
[2:01:37] moves by his Spirit not by the amount of
[2:01:39] money or talent in the church
[2:01:43] no wonder brother Brandon said the
[2:01:45] church no longer speaks for God
[2:01:47] the church is speaking for herself but
[2:01:50] the bride
[2:01:51] the bride must be available to speak for
[2:01:55] God do you believe that now we move on
[2:01:58] quickly we don't have to be here all day
[2:02:01] you know in the message the testimony of
[2:02:04] a true witness
[2:02:05] 1961. now we're getting somewhere
[2:02:08] paragraph 186 I want you to hear this
[2:02:13] he said what church that's the reason I
[2:02:16] can't take the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:02:18] of crying shaking or speaking tongues or
[2:02:21] any sensation they're all right now see
[2:02:23] them things are all right but the devil
[2:02:28] can impersonate that so real
[2:02:33] so we cannot judge the genuineness of
[2:02:36] someone's holy spirit because they shook
[2:02:38] or spoke in tongues or had sensation
[2:02:40] brother random is in no way taking these
[2:02:43] away from the experience
[2:02:45] but here's what he wanted us to
[2:02:46] understand is the definition of a person
[2:02:48] who is truly baptized with the Holy
[2:02:50] Ghost 187 you know you ought to mark
[2:02:53] this down or or go on the app and copy
[2:02:55] and paste this or something you ought to
[2:02:57] read this often you you ought to be in a
[2:03:00] bad trial
[2:03:02] you you ought to be hurting
[2:03:06] uh wait till you got some pain going on
[2:03:08] somewhere and you want to pull your hair
[2:03:11] out
[2:03:11] and and troubles and trials and every
[2:03:14] phone call uh is is is worse than the
[2:03:17] one before it
[2:03:18] and every text is worse than the one
[2:03:20] before it and you're being criticized
[2:03:22] for things you don't even know why
[2:03:24] you're being criticized you you don't
[2:03:26] even understand exactly what you've done
[2:03:28] all this piling in on you then you ought
[2:03:30] to pull this quote out and read
[2:03:32] but the Holy Ghost is deity
[2:03:34] [Music]
[2:03:38] glory god tabernacled
[2:03:41] in man
[2:03:43] not only one man
[2:03:45] not only one man and a generation
[2:03:48] God tabernacled in man if you've
[2:03:52] received the genuine baptism of the Holy
[2:03:54] Ghost God is tabernacled in your body
[2:03:57] it's more than a sensation amen
[2:04:01] you see I underline that for you
[2:04:03] it's more than in speaking in tongues
[2:04:06] yes amen it's more than shouting in the
[2:04:10] spirit I believe that
[2:04:12] it's more than weeping sure it is it's
[2:04:15] more than joining church it's what
[2:04:20] God
[2:04:21] Living God living
[2:04:25] God living in man
[2:04:29] it's God living in man
[2:04:34] deity
[2:04:37] deity
[2:04:40] well that's God
[2:04:42] is that God did
[2:04:45] that's who God is
[2:04:46] God himself
[2:04:49] tabernacled into that person
[2:04:55] this is what we need to be focusing on
[2:04:58] not some happy birthday Jesus junk
[2:05:01] please please I have precious friends
[2:05:05] that I have fought in the trenches with
[2:05:08] who baked the Lord a birthday cake I
[2:05:12] hope you sit at your kitchen table until
[2:05:14] he comes and takes a bite
[2:05:21] this is so late in the hour
[2:05:24] honestly folks
[2:05:25] it's so late in the hour I have a
[2:05:28] precious friend that I have I've really
[2:05:30] fought with and for who posted this
[2:05:32] picture of a man dressed up in a Santa
[2:05:34] Claus suit it wasn't the famous painting
[2:05:37] but it was a man dressed up in a Santa
[2:05:39] Claus suit kneeling down at the at a
[2:05:42] picture of Jesus
[2:05:43] this is blasphemy
[2:05:46] this is paganism it it's so turns my
[2:05:52] stomach
[2:05:53] first of all we're not Catholic and we
[2:05:55] don't bow down to pictures
[2:05:59] you thought I was going to talk about
[2:06:00] the man in the suit didn't you
[2:06:03] I didn't even get to that
[2:06:05] here he is kneeling down before a
[2:06:07] picture of Jesus why would you want to
[2:06:10] find a picture of Jesus to honor
[2:06:14] to show kindness to or respect for when
[2:06:19] there's a church room full of jesuses
[2:06:23] there's some people here who have been
[2:06:25] filled with the very life of Jesus
[2:06:27] Christ show kindness to them
[2:06:31] bake them a cake
[2:06:34] do something nice for one another
[2:06:37] but to bow down to a picture of Jesus is
[2:06:40] is worse than Catholicism
[2:06:43] it's idolatry
[2:06:47] it's you're just as bad when you do that
[2:06:49] as the as the African who bows his knee
[2:06:51] to a picture of brother Branham it's
[2:06:53] it's absolutely Antichrist and idolatry
[2:06:58] so then then let's just say that the the
[2:07:02] picture represents Jesus let's just say
[2:07:05] that it does let's just say that the
[2:07:07] picture represents Jesus and you've got
[2:07:09] a man here with his back turned to the
[2:07:11] to the to the crowd uh with a Santa
[2:07:14] Claus suit on kneeling down now the
[2:07:16] first message I got is that's idolatry
[2:07:19] we don't bow the pictures
[2:07:21] and the second message that I got was
[2:07:23] what kind of message are you trying to
[2:07:26] show your your social media followers
[2:07:28] here is a myth
[2:07:30] oh come on well it's a phony it's it's a
[2:07:34] modern day man dressed up in a phony
[2:07:36] suit so so he's celebrating Halloween
[2:07:38] isn't he
[2:07:41] he's got on a costume he knows he's not
[2:07:44] Santa Claus so he's a phony hypocrite
[2:07:48] I'm just telling you what the picture
[2:07:49] says to me and he's bowing down to a
[2:07:52] picture of Jesus and you show that to
[2:07:54] some child and what do they see
[2:07:58] confusion and a lie
[2:08:01] because it would make you wonder if this
[2:08:04] one down here kneeling down there's no
[2:08:05] such truth to him what about this this
[2:08:08] one up here folks we ought to know
[2:08:10] better than that
[2:08:12] so you keep your birthday give give
[2:08:14] somebody in here a cake and let them
[2:08:16] tote the pounds around
[2:08:17] Jesus doesn't want your cake
[2:08:20] Jesus wants your life
[2:08:22] he wants you to celebrate by yielding
[2:08:25] your life to him God himself tabernacled
[2:08:28] in that person
[2:08:30] when he can speak
[2:08:35] [Music]
[2:08:38] go back to the beginning of paragraph
[2:08:39] 187 because I interrupted it with my own
[2:08:42] story
[2:08:43] but the Holy Ghost is deity God
[2:08:46] tabernacled in a man it's more than a
[2:08:48] sensation more than speaking in tongues
[2:08:50] more than shouting in the spirit it's
[2:08:52] more than weeping it's more than joining
[2:08:54] church it's God living in man deity God
[2:08:57] himself tabernacled in that person when
[2:08:59] he can speak and it's just the same as
[2:09:03] God's speaking that's the Church of
[2:09:05] Jesus Christ that's the way the First
[2:09:08] Apostolic Church went forth I want to
[2:09:11] ask you for do do you believe that
[2:09:14] that's the way the First Apostolic
[2:09:16] Church went forth
[2:09:18] do you believe they spoke for God
[2:09:23] do you believe in your heart that there
[2:09:26] ought to be a last day people doing the
[2:09:27] same today I believe with all my heart I
[2:09:30] believe with all my heart so I I'd
[2:09:32] forgive us if we don't have time uh to
[2:09:35] to patty cake with you
[2:09:39] forgive us that there's a time to to
[2:09:42] play
[2:09:45] there's a time to pray there's a time to
[2:09:48] be a clown I like funny
[2:09:52] foreign
[2:09:54] what I don't like is when people think
[2:09:56] they're funny
[2:09:58] and they're definitely not
[2:10:03] some things are taboo and some things
[2:10:06] are off limits
[2:10:08] and some things we shouldn't try to make
[2:10:11] funny because there's nothing at all
[2:10:13] funny about them
[2:10:15] anybody with me
[2:10:17] they're just certain things in certain
[2:10:20] subjects we should never try to make a
[2:10:22] joke of or try to make it laughable
[2:10:24] because it's just too serious of a
[2:10:27] subject to be laughable at all I'm not
[2:10:30] against having a good time I'm not
[2:10:32] against being funny I'm not against
[2:10:33] poking on one another I've told you
[2:10:36] before that's my love language when I
[2:10:38] quit poking on you that's when you need
[2:10:39] to be concerned
[2:10:41] some of you have not known long enough
[2:10:43] to poke on you much yet but I'm I'm
[2:10:45] working on it I'm I'm getting my
[2:10:46] ammunition up I'm not against that
[2:10:49] I'm not against that but there's a times
[2:10:52] for those kinds of things and there's a
[2:10:54] time to be serious
[2:10:57] there's a time to understand that we are
[2:11:00] here representing a God in the earth and
[2:11:04] and what comes out of our mouth is being
[2:11:06] weighed all the time whether we realize
[2:11:08] it or not every word that comes out of
[2:11:11] our mouth is being weighed by a living
[2:11:13] God he hears our slang
[2:11:17] he hears our euphemisms
[2:11:20] he hears it he knows we would never take
[2:11:23] the name Jesus Christ in some vain way
[2:11:26] but he knows when we use other words
[2:11:29] better euphemisms for Jesus Christ
[2:11:34] he's our disrespect you think I'm going
[2:11:36] to use JC as the initials of Jesus
[2:11:38] Christ when I'm writing something
[2:11:41] are you kidding don't you have any
[2:11:43] respect at all
[2:11:44] you see people become so common that
[2:11:47] they become so frivolous
[2:11:50] and then you you get up here and you try
[2:11:52] to talk to him about deity and God
[2:11:55] tabernacling in man and they say Amen
[2:11:57] but they don't see it
[2:12:00] because if they saw it they'd be
[2:12:02] reaching for it you need to join the
[2:12:05] ranks of those who are actively reaching
[2:12:08] for that time
[2:12:10] that when I speak it's God speaking
[2:12:13] through me when you speak it's God
[2:12:16] speaking through you why because we've
[2:12:18] got cancers that we need to see
[2:12:20] disappear
[2:12:21] We've Got Brains that we need to see
[2:12:25] the miracle of epigenetics we need to
[2:12:28] see God renewing and reforming brains
[2:12:33] we need to seek God recreating damage
[2:12:37] damage that has been done and God
[2:12:39] recreating healthy cells
[2:12:42] we've come down to that hour where we're
[2:12:45] going and we're coming even to a tighter
[2:12:47] time when we're going to need that
[2:12:48] Authority
[2:12:50] we're going to need that Authority we're
[2:12:52] going to need it we're certainly going
[2:12:53] to need it in the message the word
[2:12:54] became flesh sometimes called the India
[2:12:58] trip report but I can't recommend that
[2:13:00] message enough 1954. I can't recommend
[2:13:03] that message enough
[2:13:05] it's so much more than an India trip
[2:13:07] report
[2:13:08] brother random says some of the most
[2:13:09] powerful things of his ministry in that
[2:13:12] message 1954 October the 3rd and in
[2:13:15] paragraph 238 and he said now to redeem
[2:13:18] that Fallen race I'll send forth my son
[2:13:21] Christ Jesus there was the word in the
[2:13:24] beginning before it was a word it was a
[2:13:28] thought before it was a thought it was
[2:13:31] expressed in a word and the word became
[2:13:34] material
[2:13:36] and the word became material
[2:13:40] and dwelt among us hallelujah 10 million
[2:13:44] years maybe before the world was ever
[2:13:46] formed God's thought seen his body
[2:13:52] tabernacled in flesh
[2:13:55] what for to take the sting out of death
[2:14:00] powerful he said how Eternal is the word
[2:14:04] of God all times will change years will
[2:14:07] come and go ends of time will pass away
[2:14:10] but God's word will remain forever there
[2:14:15] it is
[2:14:16] 2022 is coming to an end in 2023 is
[2:14:20] about to begin and God's clock just
[2:14:22] keeps on ticking it doesn't even
[2:14:24] register the change do you hear me
[2:14:27] God's God's clock doesn't even register
[2:14:29] the change
[2:14:32] someone asked are we going to have a
[2:14:34] watch Night Service this coming weekend
[2:14:36] we're not
[2:14:37] but we're going to have Sunday morning
[2:14:39] service at 11 o'clock and you have no
[2:14:41] excuse not to be here
[2:14:44] I'm certainly not going to encourage
[2:14:46] people staying out till after midnight
[2:14:48] and then preaching to a sleeping
[2:14:50] congregation on Sunday morning
[2:14:52] so we're gonna do it one time next
[2:14:54] Sunday and we're gonna do it till we get
[2:14:56] done
[2:14:57] so no no watch tonight service you want
[2:14:59] to have a watch tonight you gather
[2:15:00] around in your house but just remember
[2:15:02] that God's clock doesn't shift or change
[2:15:04] he does not follow the Pope's calendar
[2:15:08] can somebody say man God doesn't follow
[2:15:11] the Pope's calendar
[2:15:15] he's got his own
[2:15:16] why would he need the popes
[2:15:21] anything that God's already speaking
[2:15:24] into this coming year it's already here
[2:15:26] it's already with us and maybe it will
[2:15:28] accelerate I've seen it accelerate and
[2:15:30] be accentuated around the time that the
[2:15:32] Gregorian calendar changes but it's more
[2:15:34] important for us to be here Sunday
[2:15:36] morning alert ready to hear the word of
[2:15:38] God ready to worship like you did this
[2:15:40] morning
[2:15:42] those people who had not heard and
[2:15:44] didn't know they would have never known
[2:15:46] that there had been a flood
[2:15:48] they would never know that people had to
[2:15:50] go home and change clothes to come back
[2:15:51] and help they would have never known
[2:15:52] that people were waiting through water
[2:15:54] in their dress shoes to get the job done
[2:15:56] and toting my life
[2:16:01] in those four filing cabinets
[2:16:04] out of there at their full brother
[2:16:07] sister
[2:16:08] anybody left
[2:16:11] you Brothers need prayer for your backs
[2:16:14] you would know that all that had gone on
[2:16:17] right till right till church and some
[2:16:18] were all were working through worship to
[2:16:20] get it you wouldn't have known that
[2:16:22] because we we determined before we
[2:16:24] started
[2:16:25] we're here to give God glory
[2:16:29] now let me let me move on
[2:16:31] in a message called we've made a little
[2:16:34] progress here got a few more minutes
[2:16:35] three kinds of Believers you know
[2:16:37] there's always three kinds of Believers
[2:16:39] in every Church
[2:16:40] I would love to say except ours
[2:16:44] but we can't
[2:16:47] True Believers
[2:16:50] unbelievers
[2:16:51] make believers
[2:16:53] they're always there
[2:16:54] paragraph 63 of said message
[2:16:57] and here we are down to the layout to
[2:16:59] see an age and we're caught in the
[2:17:01] laodicean age that Christ was put out of
[2:17:04] his church and was even knocking on the
[2:17:07] door trying to get back in so when we
[2:17:09] see that happening we know what age
[2:17:11] we're living in anybody know we're
[2:17:13] living in laodicea
[2:17:15] one of my dear friends before he passed
[2:17:18] away had the church in Philadelphia
[2:17:20] of all the ages I would have never
[2:17:22] guessed that we would have been in
[2:17:23] Philadelphia a church age because that
[2:17:25] was the church age of Brotherly Love and
[2:17:27] you don't have to be anybody to know
[2:17:29] there's not a whole lot of Brotherly
[2:17:31] Love
[2:17:33] we've definitely passed the age of
[2:17:34] Brotherly Love we're definitely now in
[2:17:36] the last of the last days and that's how
[2:17:38] we recognize it he said and then we're
[2:17:40] at the closing of the history of the
[2:17:42] world the book is now being finished the
[2:17:45] last line will be wrote across it
[2:17:47] someday and she'll be closed up then
[2:17:49] time shall be no more and there's a
[2:17:53] great drama being set I want you to see
[2:17:56] this
[2:17:57] there's a great drama being said and
[2:18:00] angels are standing over the skies
[2:18:01] watching I want you just to imagine that
[2:18:03] we're not we're not into some kind of
[2:18:06] meditation or meditative imagery but I'd
[2:18:08] like for you to just kind of Imagine in
[2:18:09] your mind the sky is full uh today of
[2:18:12] angels looking over looking over the
[2:18:14] clouds right down into December 25th of
[2:18:18] 2022 maybe looking over this Campground
[2:18:20] looking over your neighborhood where you
[2:18:22] live looking over the place where you
[2:18:24] work all looking over the Earth you you
[2:18:26] there's a drama that the angels are
[2:18:28] standing over the skies watching you
[2:18:30] know what a drama is the actors are
[2:18:31] ready
[2:18:32] and you can see them beginning to act
[2:18:36] playing out their roles you can see the
[2:18:38] evil one acting how many of you see him
[2:18:40] showing up he's showing out all the time
[2:18:44] you can see the villain of the play how
[2:18:46] he's come on the scene with the
[2:18:48] cunningness to deceive anybody recognize
[2:18:51] that kind of spirit in the world today
[2:18:52] but you can also see the Rapture Church
[2:18:56] making herself ready
[2:18:58] I love the way he words this
[2:19:01] you see in brother random's mind she's
[2:19:03] already raptured
[2:19:04] you see in God's mind she's already
[2:19:06] raptured
[2:19:08] you see in my mind she's already
[2:19:09] raptured because the Rapture is a
[2:19:11] process and the Rapture is in progress
[2:19:14] now
[2:19:16] it's already started we're not waiting
[2:19:19] on on a Rapture to begin we're waiting
[2:19:21] on a Rapture to finish the Rapture has
[2:19:24] already started somebody said why how
[2:19:26] could you say such thing the Bible said
[2:19:28] in Revelation chapter 4 and a voice said
[2:19:31] come up
[2:19:33] I want to show you some things that you
[2:19:37] don't know anything about that's the
[2:19:38] bride
[2:19:40] John represents the broad church when
[2:19:42] John was called up that that symbolizes
[2:19:45] for us the bride has been caught up and
[2:19:47] she's got the Isaiah and she sees some
[2:19:49] things today she never saw before so the
[2:19:52] Rapture is already moving brother he
[2:19:54] said but can you also see the Rapture
[2:19:56] Church making herself ready it's a great
[2:19:58] scene you can see the presence of God
[2:20:01] vindicating and making the great drama
[2:20:03] that's foretold here in the Bible to act
[2:20:05] itself out it's just clicking along I
[2:20:08] want you to see clicking along
[2:20:13] somebody said oh my I sure did throw a
[2:20:16] kink in the wheel when Joe Biden come
[2:20:17] along not at all
[2:20:20] in fact it might have just slowed things
[2:20:21] down a little bit he's slow
[2:20:24] I might have just slowed things down a
[2:20:26] little bit but it's still moving
[2:20:28] still moving
[2:20:30] still moving and come next election when
[2:20:33] the when so many in our nation don't get
[2:20:35] what they want
[2:20:38] to be the same kind of thing
[2:20:42] oh my
[2:20:44] the next one who comes he may not be too
[2:20:47] old to do the job
[2:20:49] it may not be too mentally oppressed to
[2:20:51] do the job he may be Sharp
[2:20:53] and he may get the job done and we may
[2:20:55] have lots to complain about
[2:20:57] come on but you just remember that oh I
[2:21:00] felt something there God's drama would
[2:21:02] just keep right on moving
[2:21:04] keep right on cooking just let me tell
[2:21:06] you something God doesn't have to have
[2:21:07] President Trump
[2:21:09] for his economy did you keep moving on
[2:21:12] and I'll tell you what America is going
[2:21:13] to get she's going to get exactly what
[2:21:15] she deserves
[2:21:15] [Music]
[2:21:17] that's how this thing works you know
[2:21:18] we're so close to the end time now
[2:21:20] that's exactly how it works we vote our
[2:21:23] convictions according to how God has
[2:21:25] taught us in the word but we also
[2:21:26] understand that it's God who puts up God
[2:21:29] who pulls it come on now come on now
[2:21:33] what a time to live the most glorious
[2:21:35] time what
[2:21:38] you must not know about my week

[2:21:45] time the man of all ages oh I believe it
[2:21:49] I believe it I believe the bride in
[2:21:52] every Church age has longed to see this
[2:21:55] day
[2:21:56] and here we are long for this time the
[2:22:00] prophets of old long to see this hour
[2:22:02] but wasn't privileged
[2:22:04] now there was a Believer because he's
[2:22:07] seen it he believed it we're fully
[2:22:09] persuaded that thou art the Christ the
[2:22:11] Messiah the word of God for this day and
[2:22:13] we believe that see that was a real
[2:22:17] believer I want you to know there are

[2:26:59] and it might have had one every day
[2:27:02] but his love paid for my sin
[2:27:04] his love taking it away love is the most
[2:27:06] powerful force there is but you can't
[2:27:09] just expect that to be automatic
[2:27:12] you've got to Fellowship that
[2:27:14] you've got to ask for forgiveness when

[2:28:58] that's where God's trying to get his
[2:28:59] church just say to this mountain be
[2:29:02] moved
[2:29:03] and it will move Authority
[2:29:06] sons of God the whole creation's
[2:29:08] groaning waiting from the manifestation
[2:29:11] of the sons of God wading to a spot to
[2:29:14] where that sickness will be arise and it
[2:29:17] will be that way
[2:29:18] the blind will receive their sight he's
[2:29:21] prophesying the deaf and dumb we pray
[2:29:24] for them now we pray for them now we
[2:29:26] pray for them now
[2:29:28] but then
[2:29:34] you'll
[2:29:36] commanded
[2:29:37] that's the authority of a son
[2:29:40] your name on the checkbook is as good as
[2:29:42] papa's name on the checkbook that's why
[2:29:44] we're pressing toward this perfection in
[2:29:46] Christ these signs shall follow them
[2:29:48] that believe they shall pray for the
[2:29:49] sick he said the cast out Devil's not I
[2:29:51] will they will
[2:29:53] if you say to this mountain not if I say
[2:29:57] if you say to this mountain be moved and
[2:29:59] don't doubt it in your heart what we
[2:30:01] need is adoption
[2:30:02] Sons and Daughters needs adoption you
[2:30:06] cannot have adoption until you prove
[2:30:07] yourself you can't prove yourself until
[2:30:09] you're tested and tried
[2:30:11] you can't be tested and tried until
[2:30:13] God's hand is on you
[2:30:15] he'd never send you to testing trials
[2:30:19] without putting his hand on you
[2:30:21] because he's the one that decides when
[2:30:23] the enemy has gone far enough
[2:30:25] let me tell you something the enemy is a
[2:30:28] tool in his hand and when he when he
[2:30:30] says that's it that's enough
[2:30:32] when you and I say the right thing
[2:30:36] one of these days
[2:30:42] he said to
[2:30:46] Jimmy Gillette is that right
[2:30:53] they tell me that he said it to brother
[2:30:55] Barker
[2:30:56] also is anybody don't you know don't you
[2:31:00] remember the name Jimmy Gillette does
[2:31:02] that sound
[2:31:06] yes it's Jimmy Gillette I met him
[2:31:10] he was in a wheelchair
[2:31:12] he may still be alive he was still alive
[2:31:15] a few years back but he may be going on
[2:31:16] now
[2:31:18] but his testimony was that brother
[2:31:19] Branham said to him I remember his wife
[2:31:22] used to take him around and he sung and
[2:31:24] he sung from the wheelchair
[2:31:26] and he said that brother Branham said to
[2:31:28] him one day Jimmy one of these days
[2:31:30] you'll say the right word
[2:31:33] and you'll come out of that wheelchair
[2:31:37] somebody said well I don't aren't you
[2:31:39] going to tell us the restaurant I don't
[2:31:40] know the rest of the story
[2:31:42] if he's still here he still has the
[2:31:44] potential of that coming completely to
[2:31:46] pass in his life if he's there it
[2:31:48] already has
[2:31:52] but let me tell you something I don't
[2:31:53] believe that that I heard that by
[2:31:55] mistake
[2:31:56] I I believe it's a message to me
[2:31:59] I believe it's a message to you I
[2:32:01] believe I can say to you that one of
[2:32:03] these days in the midst of your fiery
[2:32:05] furnace one of these days in the midst
[2:32:07] of your trial you'll rise up and say the
[2:32:09] right word
[2:32:12] and when you do you'll recognize who you
[2:32:15] are and you'll say to the mountain get
[2:32:16] out of my way
[2:32:18] I think we look at that scripture as so
[2:32:21] something that could possibly happen we
[2:32:23] need to look at that as something that
[2:32:24] will happen
[2:32:26] in our lives but not without a test
[2:32:30] well we're getting that down pat
[2:32:32] now we've got to keep walking through
[2:32:34] that until we
[2:32:36] speak the right word
[2:32:38] and let me just tell you this if you're
[2:32:40] looking this way
[2:32:42] Nobody Knows the Trouble I've seen
[2:32:45] that's not going to be the right word
[2:32:50] singing along with a hound dog
[2:32:53] ain't nobody been through what I've been
[2:32:55] through
[2:32:57] ain't nobody's bruised as big as mine
[2:33:00] ain't nobody's scar as big as mine ain't
[2:33:03] nobody been through as much as I have
[2:33:05] nobody's had a childhood like I've had
[2:33:07] nobody suffered like I've suffered
[2:33:15] I said to a couple of folks a few
[2:33:17] Sundays that go out there in the
[2:33:18] vestibule was standing there in so much
[2:33:20] pain after preaching I thought I'm going
[2:33:22] to collapse
[2:33:24] and I said to a couple people who
[2:33:26] stopped about seven feet short of me for
[2:33:28] me to walk over and shake their hand
[2:33:30] I said to them no you come to me
[2:33:34] and I didn't do that to be rude
[2:33:37] I did that because people have this
[2:33:39] tendency to think that nobody is in the
[2:33:41] shape they're in
[2:33:43] well I want you to know some folks are
[2:33:45] just as bad off as you are they just
[2:33:48] wear it better than you do
[2:33:53] some people don't tell the world about
[2:33:55] it
[2:33:56] there are people in here that go through
[2:33:58] great trials and never make one post
[2:34:04] one of these days let me tell you
[2:34:07] something it doesn't matter who's going
[2:34:08] through what what matters is when we
[2:34:11] realize that we're not going to be
[2:34:13] lifted up out of that with authority by
[2:34:15] singing a sad song
[2:34:20] we're gonna have to learn to dance in
[2:34:21] the flood
[2:34:25] we're going to have to be willing just
[2:34:27] to let God be glorified in all things
[2:34:30] Hallelujah
[2:34:31] and remember I've taught you not
[2:34:33] Hallelujah anyhow it ain't no Hallelujah
[2:34:36] anyhow
[2:34:37] because that's just like any old praise
[2:34:39] it's not a Hallelujah anyhow it's
[2:34:41] Hallelujah because
[2:34:44] Hallelujah because you are still God
[2:34:49] in the midst of my heartache
[2:34:52] in the midst of my loss in the middle of
[2:34:55] my pain you are still God
[2:35:02] it's intentional praise
[2:35:06] Hallelujah
[2:35:08] we're nearly done
[2:35:10] we pray for them now but one day you'll
[2:35:13] command it
[2:35:16] paragraph 62 but how can the church the
[2:35:18] Pentecostal Church the Methodist Church
[2:35:20] and the Baptist Churches be adopted
[2:35:22] until they come to discipline
[2:35:24] we've got to be disciplined first God
[2:35:27] could not trust this power with the
[2:35:29] church it's hard to tell what you would
[2:35:31] do
[2:35:33] I've always known this about the spoken
[2:35:35] word I've known that we wouldn't go to
[2:35:37] the hard cases first we'd try to
[2:35:39] exercise it on our enemies
[2:35:41] foreign
[2:35:45] I can just see church folks I've been to
[2:35:48] church with just trying to put a wart on
[2:35:49] somebody's nose
[2:35:52] make her uglier than she is Lord
[2:35:58] you're not going to use this Authority
[2:36:00] for your personal Vendetta
[2:36:03] you're not going to use this authority
[2:36:05] to call something down on somebody else
[2:36:07] you're going to use this authority to do
[2:36:09] what the will of God is
[2:36:11] the church has got to come to a place
[2:36:12] where it's disciplined God's on that
[2:36:14] work right now
[2:36:17] he said he could he could How could a
[2:36:19] father trust his business with a boy
[2:36:20] that might simply pollute his whole
[2:36:22] inheritance he couldn't do it the church
[2:36:24] has got to come to a place to where it's
[2:36:26] discipline God's on that work right now
[2:36:28] Hallelujah
[2:36:30] God's on that work right now discipline
[2:36:34] now in that moment we're nearly done
[2:36:36] musicians coming
[2:36:43] in that moment
[2:36:46] when you have fallen short
[2:36:51] I I had you to raise your hand look to
[2:36:53] be like it just about everybody
[2:36:57] it's good to know
[2:36:58] that we're not alone
[2:37:06] entertain the thought
[2:37:09] spoke a word
[2:37:12] did something you knew better than to do
[2:37:18] vindictive
[2:37:21] judgmental
[2:37:29] we couldn't even come to worship this
[2:37:31] morning
[2:37:32] if that's what we would have thought
[2:37:33] about
[2:37:35] if that becomes the focus
[2:37:38] of our mindset when we wake up on a
[2:37:40] Sunday morning we won't do God any good
[2:37:42] we won't do ourselves any good we got to
[2:37:44] learn how to break that
[2:37:46] each and every time the enemy comes to
[2:37:48] condemn you for your sin let's just
[2:37:51] let's just call it because it's an
[2:37:53] expression of unbelief when we do the
[2:37:54] things we know we shouldn't do
[2:37:57] here's what I want you to remember
[2:38:02] in the message job
[2:38:05] paragraph 24. he just started off with
[2:38:08] something good this time paragraph 24.
[2:38:11] he said that's the way it is today we
[2:38:13] guilty unworthy should die
[2:38:16] we're not worthy of living we're not
[2:38:18] worthy to come to Christ we're not
[2:38:19] worthy to ask anything but God never
[2:38:23] looks
[2:38:25] got a pen in here who has a pen in your
[2:38:27] hand Bethany write it write it on your
[2:38:30] paper God no no start with but but God
[2:38:34] never looks at your unworthiness who
[2:38:39] else is writing it let me see your hand
[2:38:40] for writing it write it
[2:38:42] if you've got a pen write it
[2:38:46] your brain will remember it longer if
[2:38:49] you write it
[2:38:53] and say it like sister Weems teaches us
[2:38:56] memory challenged people
[2:39:00] say it out loud when you're getting
[2:39:02] ready to go into a room to get something
[2:39:04] so when you get there you'll remember
[2:39:05] what you're going to get say it out loud
[2:39:08] the world calls it talking to yourself
[2:39:10] you just talk to angels tell the angels
[2:39:13] do whatever you have to do say it out
[2:39:15] loud but God never looks at your
[2:39:20] unworthiness
[2:39:23] semicolon
[2:39:25] he looked
[2:39:30] right it
[2:39:34] borrow loan your pen to somebody
[2:39:36] write it Aaron you ought to be I mean uh
[2:39:38] yeah no what is your name Ian you ought
[2:39:41] to be writing it you got it I see your
[2:39:43] PIN now
[2:39:44] ride it
[2:39:48] he looked at the lamb
[2:39:55] if God never looks at your unworthiness
[2:39:58] do you think he wants you looking at it
[2:40:00] all the time I don't think so
[2:40:03] that's why I'm not going to Crone up
[2:40:05] here singing old song we used to sing
[2:40:06] unworthy
[2:40:09] in bondage and alone
[2:40:12] until you until you get to the good
[2:40:13] stuff
[2:40:15] which usually not the emphasis of the
[2:40:17] song but it should be but he made me
[2:40:21] Worthy and now by
[2:40:25] [Music]
[2:40:26] sea hath made me his own
[2:40:33] but God never looks at your unworthiness
[2:40:39] he looked at the lamb did you get it
[2:40:42] wrote
[2:40:44] he looked at the lamb
[2:40:48] somebody said I don't have to write it
[2:40:49] down I can remember it are you kidding
[2:40:51] who are you kidding
[2:40:54] you can't remember what time church
[2:40:56] starts
[2:41:01] but God never looked at your
[2:41:05] unworthiness
[2:41:07] [Music]
[2:41:08] I got tickled at brother man's tickle
[2:41:11] he got tickled at me and it tickled me
[2:41:17] he looked at the lamb now if he can't
[2:41:20] find no fault in Christ
[2:41:23] who is your lamb
[2:41:27] Allelujah and if the father looks at the
[2:41:29] lamb and can't find any spot in him
[2:41:34] he's not looking at the unworthiness of
[2:41:37] the worshiper he's looking at the
[2:41:39] worthiness of the offering
[2:41:42] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:41:45] that is not an excuse
[2:41:48] for us to live like devils
[2:41:51] but it says that when we try when we
[2:41:54] have the desire to do what's right
[2:41:58] and we stumble in our ways
[2:42:00] we have a lamb we have an offering we
[2:42:03] have a Christ
[2:42:04] that's always Worthy
[2:42:07] he said that's the way it is today
[2:42:09] we uh go did we finish that
[2:42:15] you say ah he died in your Stead
[2:42:18] now if there's any fault with him you're
[2:42:20] not free yet
[2:42:23] maybe you ought to write this down
[2:42:27] but God don't examine you
[2:42:32] he didn't have to
[2:42:34] he told us to examine ourselves
[2:42:39] he examines the lamb but God don't
[2:42:41] examine you
[2:42:43] semicolon he examines
[2:42:48] the lamb or colon which is it semicolon
[2:42:52] here I was pretend like I knew something
[2:42:54] and then all of a sudden I wasn't sure
[2:42:57] but God don't examine you
[2:42:59] he examines the lamb you say I'm not
[2:43:01] worthy to walk out of this wheelchair
[2:43:03] tonight that's right
[2:43:05] you're not
[2:43:06] but God don't examine you he examined
[2:43:10] Christ and if he's worthy then you can
[2:43:12] walk
[2:43:17] say it your friend
[2:43:20] free
[2:43:22] now here's where it gets really really
[2:43:25] powerful
[2:43:26] he said God can't see you
[2:43:31] why because he's placed the lamb between
[2:43:33] he and you
[2:43:36] that's a thinking man's filter
[2:43:39] he's placed the blood there
[2:43:42] oh he could push the blood aside
[2:43:45] but he put it there
[2:43:47] he would never take that away he put it
[2:43:49] there for this for this job
[2:43:53] he sees the lamb dies in your stead
[2:43:55] that's enough to make a fellow shout
[2:43:57] isn't it sure is
[2:43:59] when you think that upon the basis of
[2:44:01] the word
[2:44:03] now that's where we're talking we're on
[2:44:05] the basis of the word and then
[2:44:06] Revelation chapter four number three
[2:44:09] paragraph 119 the preachers called to
[2:44:12] preach yes and to live it too if you
[2:44:14] can't live it then you stop preaching it
[2:44:18] but you're supposed to live your sermons
[2:44:20] that's right that's right brother
[2:44:22] Shelley you've got to live it
[2:44:26] all right here was voices
[2:44:29] oh how we need in Jeffersonville
[2:44:31] thousands of
[2:44:35] we got voices
[2:44:38] we need lived voices
[2:44:40] we need voices who have found the life
[2:44:43] and I want you to listen at what he
[2:44:45] calls it this is so powerful
[2:44:48] and it might be a key
[2:44:50] to understanding what the Thunders will
[2:44:53] accomplish
[2:44:54] he said we need in Jeffersonville
[2:44:57] thousands of lived voices the Thunder of
[2:44:59] God thundering out in sweetness and
[2:45:03] holiness
[2:45:05] purity
[2:45:07] undefiled lives
[2:45:11] walking around in the Earth today
[2:45:14] without a blemish
[2:45:17] yes sir real Christians
[2:45:20] would you read that to me
[2:45:23] that's
[2:45:25] that's thunder
[2:45:28] against the enemy
[2:45:33] you heard it didn't you it's powerful
[2:45:36] the devil don't care how loud you can
[2:45:38] holler
[2:45:39] never don't care how much you jump or
[2:45:41] how much you can this or that shout but
[2:45:43] What Hurts The Devil is to see that
[2:45:45] Sanctified holy life consecrated to God
[2:45:50] how can you possibly do that because the
[2:45:52] lamb is crying out on your behalf and
[2:45:55] you're just learning to surrender more
[2:45:57] and more and more and more and more to
[2:45:59] your offering to your sacrifice
[2:46:02] he said say anything to him call him
[2:46:04] anything just as sweet as it can be and
[2:46:05] move right on oh my that throws him away
[2:46:08] that's the Thunder
[2:46:11] that's the Thunder that shakes the devil
[2:46:15] when you do not respond
[2:46:25] they call you all kinds of names
[2:46:32] some criticize us if we speak in tongues
[2:46:34] some criticize us if we don't
[2:46:41] some criticize if we have drums and some
[2:46:44] would criticize if the music dragged
[2:46:47] you're never going to please this bunch
[2:46:49] of people
[2:46:51] come on folks
[2:46:53] you've got to learn to take that as
[2:46:55] sweet as you can
[2:46:58] God help me
[2:47:00] and move right on
[2:47:01] my that throws him away that's the
[2:47:04] Thunder that shakes the devil
[2:47:07] just like will you say if he could
[2:47:09] preach like a Billy Graham or an Oral
[2:47:11] Roberts or somebody great influential
[2:47:13] influential speaker oh no sometimes the
[2:47:15] devil just laughs at that
[2:47:17] he don't pay no attention to that thing
[2:47:19] then to that than nothing you get all
[2:47:21] the theology you wanted and all the
[2:47:22] Seminary training and the devil just
[2:47:24] sits back and laughs at that but when he
[2:47:26] sees that life
[2:47:29] Lord let your life be produced in me
[2:47:31] Hallelujah
[2:47:36] let's stand
[2:47:38] foreign
[2:47:41] I want to close while you're standing
[2:47:44] if you're able
[2:47:46] if you're like me you've been sitting
[2:47:47] that long standing it's not always
[2:47:49] easier
[2:47:52] the seat is not air with the shook I
[2:47:54] want to pray I've done this before for
[2:47:56] this body I wanted it again I want to
[2:47:58] read a prayer
[2:48:01] that brother Branham prayed over the
[2:48:03] people that were gathered there that
[2:48:04] night
[2:48:05] to hear the seed is not air with a shook
[2:48:08] February the 18th
[2:48:10] 1965 he said remember I want you all to
[2:48:13] play something soft I don't know if you
[2:48:15] want to have her to play the song that
[2:48:16] you're going to sing or what but I want
[2:48:19] this to already in fact I'm going to
[2:48:20] invite you to come how many will come
[2:48:22] and stand with me before we go home
[2:48:24] today

[2:48:28] and
[2:48:28] you've got a can of something waiting on
[2:48:31] you when you get home or
[2:48:32] you've made some preparation for lunch
[2:48:36] before we go I would like to pray this
[2:48:38] prayer I'd like to read this prayer over
[2:48:41] your life
[2:48:46] paragraph 169 brother Brandon said
[2:48:48] remember
[2:48:50] I'm giving you the food of the eagle
[2:48:53] the promise of God he calls His prophets
[2:48:57] Eagles

[2:49:00] a eagle
[2:49:02] he is
[2:49:03] Jehovah eagle
