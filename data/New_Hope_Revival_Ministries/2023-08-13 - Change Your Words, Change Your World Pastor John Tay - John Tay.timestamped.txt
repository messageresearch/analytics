[1:00:16] you may be seated this morning
[1:00:18] it's wonderful to be in the presence of
[1:00:21] the Lord
[1:00:22] and it's wonderful to hear his name
[1:00:25] again and again and again and again
[1:00:29] every now and again I I hear a song that
[1:00:32] repeats itself far far too much
[1:00:37] but when you're singing Jesus you could
[1:00:40] sing it all day long and it'll never
[1:00:43] wear on my nerves because that is the
[1:00:47] name there is a name given under Heaven
[1:00:49] no other name
[1:00:51] but by the name of Jesus our lord Yeshua
[1:00:54] our Messiah and he's worthy to be
[1:00:58] praised today Amen brother Elias would
[1:01:03] you come and hold the offering bag I

[1:01:12] that are out of town and some are
[1:01:14] fighting sickness sister Rebecca
[1:01:16] Shepherd also reached out for prayer and
[1:01:19] I wished it was just jam-packed because
[1:01:23] I truly believe that brother Pastor Tay
[1:01:25] has brought a word from the Lord for all
[1:01:29] of us I'm thankful for recording I'm
[1:01:32] thankful for archive I'm thankful that
[1:01:35] those who are not here will have an
[1:01:37] opportunity should they desire to hear
[1:01:39] it but I wish they could be here to hear
[1:01:41] it in person amen
[1:01:44] but I want to give you an opportunity to
[1:01:46] sow into his ministry
[1:01:48] they are here on a time of refreshing
[1:01:52] and holiday and leave it to us to make
[1:01:56] him work today but they have a few more
[1:01:59] weeks in the states and uh if we could
[1:02:02] just sew something in that would be a
[1:02:04] blessing to him his many many years of
[1:02:07] service to the Lord are outstanding in
[1:02:10] my mind today the very first time the
[1:02:15] message of Truth for this hour was
[1:02:19] preached in any church in Africa pastor
[1:02:23] Tay was sitting in that church in that
[1:02:26] service and his Pastor he was not
[1:02:30] pastoring but his Pastor the church that
[1:02:34] has grown out of that Bible Believers
[1:02:37] Fellowship has touched Many Many Nations
[1:02:40] and established I think I heard near
[1:02:43] nearly 40 churches in the surrounding
[1:02:47] nations of Africa and Pastor Tay has
[1:02:50] been faithful to the word now he not
[1:02:54] only knows the message and the quotes
[1:02:56] but he knows the Bible and that has been
[1:03:00] the theme of their Ministry for many
[1:03:02] many years and he is a man of of of
[1:03:07] limited stature in the natural but in
[1:03:10] the spirit he is a giant I'm telling you
[1:03:13] that and you're going to be blessed
[1:03:15] today so just so a little love gift
[1:03:17] toward his time here in the states would
[1:03:21] you do that he of course has come asking
[1:03:24] nothing father would you take our gifts
[1:03:27] today would you multiply them and bless
[1:03:30] them and we give unto you because we're
[1:03:33] giving to your servant to be a blessing
[1:03:36] to him and brother Jesse I pray Lord
[1:03:39] today that you would give it back press
[1:03:42] down shaken together and running over to
[1:03:45] every person who would would meet this
[1:03:47] challenge who would hear the call and
[1:03:50] sow into the work of the Lord and we
[1:03:52] will give you glory and honor and praise
[1:03:56] for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus

[1:10:05] sister Kathy is celebrating a birthday
[1:10:07] this coming Saturday happy birthday
[1:10:09] sister Kathy a little bit ahead of time
[1:10:11] God bless you
[1:10:16] we're just thankful I'm just so thankful
[1:10:20] 29 years ago
[1:10:23] uh I started on a mission trip we sent
[1:10:27] two brothers
[1:10:29] 30 years ago this year we sent two
[1:10:32] brothers
[1:10:33] across the continent of Africa to meet
[1:10:36] the brothers
[1:10:37] many of whom had invited me to come and
[1:10:40] speak
[1:10:41] men that we had never met before
[1:10:44] and we sent two
[1:10:46] green men
[1:10:49] who had never been on the mission field
[1:10:51] before
[1:10:52] and we told everybody that we had
[1:10:55] contact with in that country
[1:10:57] this is our arrival time meet at the
[1:11:00] airport
[1:11:01] and
[1:11:03] well what a lot of confusion that could
[1:11:05] cause
[1:11:07] but I'm so thankful that among those men
[1:11:12] Pastor Tay was there to greet those
[1:11:14] brothers and to treat them with respect
[1:11:17] as though they were veterans
[1:11:20] and it was their very first trip on the
[1:11:23] mission field neither one of them had
[1:11:25] ever been out of the country
[1:11:27] and their Arrangements were made for me
[1:11:30] to come the following year
[1:11:32] and that will next year will be 30 years
[1:11:35] this year 29 years ago
[1:11:37] and I've never been treated in all the
[1:11:40] places that I've been in Africa I've
[1:11:41] never been welcomed respected and
[1:11:44] treated quite like I am when I am at
[1:11:48] home at the Tema Church in Ghana West
[1:11:52] Africa
[1:11:53] when I say these things I mean them from
[1:11:56] the bottom of my heart today a general
[1:11:59] is Among Us and I mean that
[1:12:03] and I'm so thankful
[1:12:05] I'm so thankful for men
[1:12:09] who love the word of God
[1:12:13] and who will not follow
[1:12:15] the cultish
[1:12:17] tendencies
[1:12:19] of those around this message
[1:12:22] but a man who will stay right on the
[1:12:25] word no matter what the cost
[1:12:29] and he has survived every wave of
[1:12:33] fanaticism
[1:12:34] that has struck Ghana
[1:12:38] every interpretation of the Thunders has
[1:12:42] struck Ghana
[1:12:44] every thought about the seventh seal has
[1:12:48] struck Ghana and there has been one man
[1:12:51] one church and now many sister churches
[1:12:56] and many ministers who stand with him
[1:13:01] if the I heard him say it yesterday we
[1:13:04] spent several hours of Bible study with
[1:13:07] him in my office yesterday
[1:13:09] is it okay to say what you said when we
[1:13:12] were getting ready to leave brother
[1:13:14] Greeley said I see I've got a lot to
[1:13:16] learn
[1:13:18] and I said me too me too
[1:13:21] to be able to sit with someone and just
[1:13:24] be taught the scripture it's life to me
[1:13:27] and I am so honored and so thankful
[1:13:31] they have celebrated every victory in my
[1:13:35] life
[1:13:35] when Benjamin was born
[1:13:38] they went to the pulpit and announced
[1:13:40] his birth and the people cheered when
[1:13:44] before that let me let me say before
[1:13:46] that when they announced my wedding the
[1:13:49] people cheered
[1:13:50] and as each of the children come along
[1:13:52] they celebrated that and that means
[1:13:56] something to me so I'm taking the time
[1:13:59] but it's not easy to say these things to
[1:14:01] Pastor directly because he's a humble
[1:14:05] man
[1:14:06] and he will brush us off if we say
[1:14:08] anything like this but I just feel
[1:14:10] honored I just feel
[1:14:13] yeah I'm emotional but I feel honored I
[1:14:17] want God to speak to us
[1:14:21] and as always he uses
[1:14:23] human flesh
[1:14:25] human instrumentality to give us Divine
[1:14:29] truth
[1:14:31] that'll transform Our Lives
[1:14:33] I want you to sing with me only believe
[1:14:36] all things are possible as we welcome
[1:14:39] our brother Pastor John Tay to come and
[1:14:43] give us the word of the Lord amen
[1:14:46] oh
[1:14:54] oh
[1:14:57] [Music]

[1:52:18] what do you know where are you from who
[1:52:19] are you

[1:52:29] David said
[1:52:33] King

[1:53:34] [Music]
[1:53:38] so look at David
[1:53:40] you know what
[1:53:43] I'll let you go to Bible College
[1:53:46] um
[1:53:49] to update
[1:53:52] your etiquette
[1:53:54] in preaching
[1:53:59] David tried it
[1:54:02] the armor
[1:54:04] he could not move
[1:54:07] the sword of salt was to was longer or
[1:54:12] taller than David
[1:54:14] I have not proved it
[1:54:18] amen
[1:54:22] are you able
[1:54:25] they will say you
[1:54:27] hold on
[1:54:29] that was the time and the challenge that
[1:54:36] will put David in his royalty
[1:54:45] so David went
[1:54:48] I don't know how you call it in the U.S
[1:54:52] catapult is that the same word
[1:54:55] good
[1:54:56] you know
[1:54:58] we
[1:55:01] were taught the Queen's language
[1:55:07] those over here
[1:55:11] you
[1:55:12] left the Queens
[1:55:14] country and you came here
[1:55:20] and you believe that
[1:55:22] you must be the first among the equals
[1:55:28] so if
[1:55:29] the prince country
[1:55:32] the switch off the light like this we
[1:55:36] would do it like this
[1:55:41] if the Queen's country
[1:55:44] The Junction it is stop we will use
[1:55:47] yield
[1:55:53] that great
[1:55:59] so David went
[1:56:02] got five stones
[1:56:08] people will say the five stand for Jesus
[1:56:11] okay
[1:56:12] that is your language if your language
[1:56:15] Jesus has five letters that's okay
[1:56:18] but some countries the name Jesus has no
[1:56:22] five letters
[1:56:24] some will say it is faith
[1:56:28] that's up to you
[1:56:30] but David
[1:56:32] had revelation
[1:56:36] that at that time there were five giants
[1:56:43] [Music]
[1:56:45] and
[1:56:46] God made the provision
[1:56:52] for David to overcome
[1:56:55] all the existing Giants
[1:57:01] and God has already declared you and
[1:57:05] overcomer
[1:57:07] so in your life of Destiny God had made
[1:57:12] the provision that you are going to end
[1:57:15] up as an overcomer
[1:57:18] [Music]
[1:57:21] the Giant
[1:57:23] saw Little David
[1:57:25] he laughed
[1:57:28] a laughter of discouragement
[1:57:32] sister brother you are going to meet
[1:57:34] discouragement on your life Destiny
[1:57:37] Journey
[1:57:44] at the entire message can produce
[1:57:48] is that why the church can produce
[1:57:52] this young this small boy
[1:57:55] but he didn't know
[1:57:57] that inside that small structure
[1:58:02] was a giant
[1:58:05] and I'm here today
[1:58:08] to let the spirit of God
[1:58:11] wake up the Giant in you
[1:58:15] there's Giant in you
[1:58:18] there's Giant in you
[1:58:24] [Music]
[1:58:26] golak spoke words
[1:58:34] and then David
[1:58:37] took the challenge
[1:58:42] David
[1:58:43] said
[1:58:47] I
[1:58:49] shall Smite you
[1:58:54] from today
[1:58:59] don't
[1:59:01] play
[1:59:03] with words
[1:59:07] what have Spirits behind them
[1:59:16] and I want to declare to somebody
[1:59:20] you are an eaglet
[1:59:25] the anointing for this age is prophetic
[1:59:29] anointing
[1:59:31] a flying eagle
[1:59:34] and that anointing was not limited to
[1:59:39] only the prophet William Branham
[1:59:45] when you watch the four beasts
[1:59:51] and watch
[1:59:52] the four
[1:59:54] beasts that the Lord also raised
[1:59:58] the lion
[2:00:00] that anointing was not only on power
[2:00:05] [Music]
[2:00:07] even women
[2:00:09] they were having the anointing of lion
[2:00:16] when you come
[2:00:18] to the next horse
[2:00:21] the red horse
[2:00:23] the anointing
[2:00:26] what the faith of the cars
[2:00:29] it wasn't only on the prophet or the
[2:00:32] messenger
[2:00:35] it was on the Believers too
[2:00:40] you are happy I'm saying that
[2:00:42] but when I come to the end time I want
[2:00:45] to hear a louder amen
[2:00:49] when you go to the black horse rider
[2:00:55] the anointing was the face of man
[2:00:59] to meet that spirit
[2:01:04] are you here
[2:01:07] in this age
[2:01:09] of the gray or the pale horse rider
[2:01:15] the anointing is the flying eagle
[2:01:18] [Applause]
[2:01:23] prophetic anointing
[2:01:27] and that anointing was not only limited
[2:01:31] to the prophet
[2:01:35] and I'm here to declare unto you
[2:01:39] that that anointing is upon you too
[2:01:47] it may not be the same measure
[2:01:52] but if you have a cup
[2:01:55] this is water
[2:01:57] I believe it is not holy water
[2:02:01] in Africa they have a bunch of holy
[2:02:04] water
[2:02:06] they have drug and drug and it has not
[2:02:08] made them holy
[2:02:14] praise the Lord
[2:02:18] it's only Jesus
[2:02:20] who
[2:02:21] had or had the fullness
[2:02:26] of the spirit
[2:02:30] in the prophet
[2:02:33] was a measure
[2:02:37] and he said the same anointing measure
[2:02:42] in you also
[2:02:44] that is one good thing about the prophet
[2:02:49] he didn't portray himself as super human
[2:02:55] just like one of you
[2:02:58] but the gift of God makes the difference
[2:03:05] so that if if you have a small drop
[2:03:10] of this water in you
[2:03:13] is the same Jesus in you
[2:03:18] Hallelujah
[2:03:20] brother sister
[2:03:22] I've come to declare to you
[2:03:26] that let's bring Jesus from history to
[2:03:32] today
[2:03:34] maybe somebody didn't hear
[2:03:37] don't make Jesus a historical God
[2:03:43] he's the same yesterday and today
[2:03:47] and today and today the same Jesus the
[2:03:54] Same power the same anointing the same
[2:03:58] lie the same size the same Miracles or
[2:04:03] somebody shouted louder amen
[2:04:05] [Applause]
[2:04:08] same Jesus
[2:04:10] is here today
[2:04:13] in the first Exodus
[2:04:16] Moses
[2:04:18] the servant of God died
[2:04:22] and died missed diet
[2:04:26] but Yahweh of the Old Testament was not
[2:04:30] dead
[2:04:30] [Music]
[2:04:31] God's Not Dead
[2:04:34] [Music]
[2:04:36] God not dead
[2:04:39] he shall love God is not dead
[2:04:45] he
[2:04:47] feel him in my heart
[2:04:51] [Music]

[2:04:54] why me
[2:04:56] Hallelujah somebody
[2:04:59] amen amen
[2:05:00] [Applause]
[2:05:02] the same Yahweh
[2:05:06] who spoke to Moses
[2:05:09] the same Yahweh spoke to Joshua
[2:05:15] the same God
[2:05:18] who spoke to the prophet
[2:05:21] I'm here to declare to you that the same
[2:05:25] God is talking today

[2:06:00] an answer to your request

[2:06:48] Charles of fire came
