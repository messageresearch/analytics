[0:00] may have something come up this week
[0:02] that you need to send praise first
[0:06] instead of panic
[0:14] i'm going to tell you something for me
[0:16] praise and worship is the most important
[0:19] weapon
[0:22] [Music]
[0:24] what about the word what about the word
[0:25] what about the word you can't even
[0:27] praise god the way he wants to be
[0:30] praised outside of that word
[0:34] because he's not listening at your voice
[0:38] whether you can sing or not
[0:40] he's reading your heart you may have
[0:43] something come up this week that you
[0:45] need to send praise first
[0:48] instead of panic
[0:52] praise first panic later
[0:54] say it with me praise first
[0:57] panic later
[0:58] you may find out that you don't have to
[1:00] panic
[1:02] you may be caught up in faith
[1:05] you may be caught up in blessed
[1:07] assurance
[1:08] you may get so anointed in your praise
[1:11] that what was disturbing you a minute
[1:13] ago is no longer disturbing you
[1:16] you may find that your mind doesn't keep
[1:18] dragging you back to how bad it is
[1:21] anything can become a weapon when you're
[1:23] involved in active warfare but when it
[1:25] come time for god to set the order for
[1:28] the camp to move he didn't choose those
[1:31] who were the most skilled in brutal
[1:33] hand-to-hand combat he said no sin judah
[1:36] first
[1:38] let judah go before the bows and arrows
[1:40] help me
[1:42] let judah go before the bullets and the
[1:44] bombs and and all you let judah
[1:48] lead the way
[1:50] it was a good strategy then
[1:54] it's a better strategy now
[1:57] it prepares the atmosphere
[1:59] it impregnates the atmosphere with the
[2:01] promises of god when we come praising
[2:04] him it releases the atmosphere of heaven
[2:07] which is glory in our midst
[2:10] it prepares our hearts to receive the
[2:13] word when we gather corporately and send
[2:16] judah first
[2:18] when we individually get caught in a bad
[2:20] situation during the week and we
[2:23] individually or as a family decide hey
[2:27] we're not going to send emotions first
[2:30] [Music]
[2:33] we're not going to meet the enemy with
[2:35] emotions first our opinions first
[2:39] our prejudices first
[2:41] we're going to meet the enemy with
[2:42] praises first
[2:45] we're going to baffle the devils
[2:49] the demons aren't going to know what's
[2:50] going on
[2:52] because instead of getting in a tether
[2:54] and panicking and killing ourselves
[2:56] by falling into our own entrapments
[2:59] we're going to target our praise
[3:02] and our praise isn't headed toward the
[3:04] enemy our praise is heading toward our
[3:06] deliverer
[3:07] and we're going to let him know that if
[3:09] anything is accomplished in this battle
[3:11] it will be because of him
