you [Laughter] know no it's Adelaide it's Adelaide Adelaide all right so Adelaide we want to pray for her that all of these spots will disappear and there'll be no lingering effects of them I'd like to give a testimony today most of you know that once a year we go and we get a beef from my father-in-law and we put it in the freezer and so that means since we were just there that means the freezer is full God is good well I went to the freezer Josiah came to bring something back to my house the other day and we were talking about how we stay hydrated and I was telling him what I use and I remembered that I needed to get some of these little tablets out of the freezer that have been uh put there for preservations for times that I need them and when I got in the freezer the light didn't come on it has a beautiful LED light that and I when I got in the freezer and the light wasn't on I said to my wife what happened to the light of the freezer she said what light light well I know there's a light in it well then I begin to think about how that she told me that the little Robo vacuum wasn't charging and she thought it needed a new battery well I began to investigate and realize that there was no power on any of the outlets in the room where the freezer was now thanks be to God the strawberries was the only thing that I noticed that had started defrosting and they were on the door so the door is the first to start defrosting nothing else defrosted I was able to quickly go to the garage and get a cord and reroute the freezer so that it was immediately plugged back in but I still had a problem so I I have a little tester and I plugged it into the outlets in that room and it read 30 volts of electricity anybody that knows anything about electricity it should be around 120 so I went to another room 124 every receptacle in that room 30 a 30 30 volts the light still worked well I remembered that all of the the way that it was wired the electricity went to the light and then down to the receptacles that's the way the house was wired and so yesterday as I started looking for the problem I changed the breaker went in the Attic looking for the problem and then I went first to the receptacle the free Freer was plugged in thinking it pulled the most voltage maybe it had melted it was fine so then I went to another receptacle and I found that it had melted the side of the if you were to look at this you would see that the side of this receptacle you see that paint it came out of Charity's old room that receptacle was melted well when I pulled this receptacle out apparently any of you that have ever done one of the receptacles apparently the electrician forgot to tighten down one of these little screws that are on the side of the receptical and so now we've lived in this home for 20 almost 24 years just over 23 and so that has arked now apparently for almost 23 years so that's another miracle that the house did not catch fire why did it not set the breaker off I do not know but it is the grace of God that I have a home that I still have a freezer full of food and I want to give God the praise for [Applause] it now just so you know I just did a little slinging at the electrician but I was the electrician so nobody can be blamed but me but I'm so thankful for the goodness of God he Is So Good Charity do you have that video ready to roll we want to show you a video today of how the Lord has blessed us this week we told you that the concrete was poured on Monday our brothers came down from Indiana and they poured this concrete for us and we want to show you this video if you'll pull the lights down brother Hawke did an amazing job putting with with the Drone and the camera and then putting this video together and we want you to see [Music] it [Music] isn't that exciting so then yesterday we started putting up a little framing yes so it's getting exciting there's the four wall of the bathroom all right isn't that so funen Nathan said that he and Luke bullied me into getting started yesterday so we went and got some Lumber and got started so we're excited to see how the Lord will provide for this and how that we can get it all put together and in his timing we'll have this place of Fellowship ready to gather together I mean I guess we could put tables and shars on the concrete and fellowship as it is now I will tell you you'll have to hold on to your plate and your napkin and probably your glass because it's a wind tunnel but we could still have Fellowship there God is so faithful uh we're going to receive the tithe and the offering Hannah and Olivia they tell me you girls have a song if you'll come and get ready we want to receive the tithe and the offering give is giving unto the Lord because he is the one who provides for us at the start he is the one anything that we have is because of him any any clothes that you have any house that you have any money that you have any food that you have it's because that he provided it for you we may think that it's because of our ability but even our abilities is because he gave it to us Amen brother Ellas will you and brother Austin dentist go to the people today for the tithe tithe and offering and let's worship together as these young ladies sing praise the [Music] Lord this is is my desire to you Lord with all my heart I worship [Music] you all I have

let's thank God for every one of them all that they do how wonderful to have sister West with us just so beautiful to have her and she's looking so good and I'm so thankful that God you know it's a long drive she's not able to be here with us that often but uh I'm so thankful that she chose this weekend to be here and uh well the ladies had a good time yesterday and uh when we got home to the house we had another another showing of all the gifts we all went into the den and and Jenna sat in the floor and showed us everything that you all had given and they're very thankful and I'm very thankful that you did and you you made us proud and uh I appreciate every effort that was made uh we just yeah we take it personal these are my young ons and we take it personal and we appreciate you for everything that you have done for them and we're looking forward yeah we're not hiding it we are looking forward to uh having a little one e even if it has to be a girl we are very happy there it's a either boy or girl and this time it's girl who knows what it'll be the next four or five six seven eight times we don't know it's just we have no way of knowing but God knows doesn't he I want you to turn this morning before you're seated you know always if you get weary all you have to do is sit down no one's going to feel hard at you but we have a tradition that when the word of God is read we try to show honor and respect to that brother brandham told us if the Queen of England we're not we're not from the United Kingdom but if the Queen of England were to walk in we would give her reverence you know I don't know I might struggle a little bit with the King but anyway I I I'd get up might take me a while to get up but uh you know we were in a situation we were not uh we certainly were not for for uh President Obama but we happened to be in a place where he was speaking and we gave him the same respect that we we gave to prime minister Netanyahu because of the office that he held and so when we have this precious word of God it's God in word form we have God in our hands when we hold this book it's the written record of who he is and we're blessed to give honor and respect to that before we read the scripture uh there if I don't do it now I'll forget at the end of the service I'll surely forget and today is brother and sister man's wedding anniversary how many

have we have to have haymon's hats we have to have uh the cookies that we eat every year to remember that uh you know this is a Jewish thing they tried to kill us God gave us Victory we wonen let let's eat right I didn't say that the Jews say it it's part of their celebration they're they're spiritual enough to know that food can be very spiritual I make a good Jew don't I all right first John chapter 4 we're going to review a few verses here beloved let us love one another for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love may I just say that it's impossible to know God and not love because God is love he that loveth knoweth not God for God is love let's read on in this was manifested the love of God toward us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him here in is love not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins and that is much more than a covering thank God we're not just covered our sins have been remitted by the blood of the Lamb he has become our perfect substitute beloved if God so loved us we also we ought also to love one another no man have seen God at any time if we love one another God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us it's in this verse that we get the phrase perfect love or perfected Love sometimes the prophet called it Divine love what we have come to understand is the word perfect there is a word that actually means matured so we are learning to love with a mature love which is an unconditional love it's the love that God has loved us with he didn't love us any less when we were unlovable he loved us the same and this is the kind of love that we're being called to in this hour as the bride of Christ now let's go on for just a few more verses hereby we know that we dwell in him and he in us because he ha given us of his Spirit as we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the savior of the world whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the son of God God dwelleth in him and he in God he was more than a prophet he was more than a sage or a good teacher or a godly man he was the son of God he was the son of man he was the manifestation of God he is equal to all of the other manifestations of God he's not less than the father he is the father made flesh that's what the word says it doesn't matter what your church says that's what the Bible said you just can't deny that Jesus is God In the Flesh he created the womb Jesus created the womb that gave him birth how did he do that as God he did it as God I don't want to yell yet but you know this is such a foundation to stand on and we have known and believed the love that God hath to us H God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him herein is our love made mature perfect complete that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear I want you to say no fear in love if fear is present love is withdrawing so we need to pull love back in so that fear will flee because there is no fear in the presence of love but perfect love mature love does what to fear It cast it out it can't stay fear and torment cannot stay where love is abounding because fear hath torment and I always ask this when I read the scripture who can testify of that who can say fear brings torment when you become fearful your mind is tormented you are tormented in your soul which is the mind and the will and the emotions he that fearth is not made mature is not made perfect is not made complete in love we're almost done we love him because not just because it's a smart thing to do we love him because he hath first loved us did you know you couldn't love him if he hadn't loved you first and you couldn't seek him if he hadn't sought you first you couldn't know him if he hadn't known you first my that's getting good we love him because he first loved us if a man say I love God and hateth his brother he's a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love God whom he hath not seen one more verse and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth God loveth his brother also so let us be aware today that this is not a suggestion it's not just a good piece of advice it's a Commandment that if we love God we're going to have to love our brother we're going to have to love one another we're going to have to love the most unlovable this world is full of Untouchables Society likes to call them but our love has to be deep enough to reach even to them we'll never be able to love The Untouchables and the unlovables until we learn to love each other and I mean real love not not mushy you know sticky sweet I love you and then backstab father we thank you for your love it keeps us it sustains us it has redeemed us it is changing us every time we come into worship every time we come into your presence and your glory begins to move over our body over our mind over our inner being we are being changed from glory to glory I don't know how people survive who never make the effort to come into your presence Lord I Thank you that you have made the way you have opened up the door you have removed the veil and you have said come in I invite might you in there's no longer a veil to keep us out there's no longer cherub Beam with flaming sword to keep us out but now they stand guard to help push us in and so today because we have already been in your presence we will leave here higher than what we came in we will leave here closer to you than what we came in it doesn't matter how we feel we may ultimately feel the exact same way but your word said when we come into your presence we are changed and we just want to give you glory and honor for that promise and we believe it and we say in our hearts in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we say Amen you may be seated I want to share with you a quotation today from the message blind bardus I don't know if this is the the the blind bardus uh you know he told it many times and one time he's he's talking about uh Prince of the House of David the book and he talks about and you know I bring this out because I love it I love when we can see the humanity of one another and the Servants of the Lord are called but they're human and brother brandham is making a beautiful drama of this story and all of a sudden he says that blind bardus turned and saw the lamb but blind bmus was blind he said he saw a rock and he pulled himself up and sat down on that rock in other words we can get a little dramatic in our telling of something and miss a detail here but potentially a few seconds later the beggar who couldn't see the the blind man who couldn't see the lamb the blind man who couldn't see the rock just a few minutes later when he touched Jesus he saw everything aren't you glad for that in the message blind bardus paragraph 146 he said friends I'm not a little boy anymore or no more I've seen many a test but I've never seen nothing yet could over ride love it just takes everything out of the way love conquers wild animal love conquers it's just the most conquering force that there is because it's God God is love love is God and love is a conquering force can you say amen he said you know why I can help you it's because you love me and and this works with your pastor or your brother or your sister in Christ I can help you because you love me and you believe me you didn't believe me no matter what kind of works God would do by me or through me you still wouldn't get any benefit do you know that he said that's my success with the Lord the people love me and I love them now brother brandom is crediting the success of his ministry to this one thing love love remember the the the angel said if you can get the people to believe you nothing will stand before you not even cancer so believing is is is not just believing it's it's loving as well love is kind of the bond that's putting the faith in there he said the people love me and I love them and that's where the success comes from a and he goes on so if if you want to be successful in anything you do for the Lord you must love you receive love and you know there are those of us who struggle in receiving love I know people who who really struggle to say the words out loud to the Lord I love you Lord and you don't want to be critical of somebody like that because they're struggling with receiving love and when you struggle being loved it becomes automatic that you struggle expressing love but if you could catch a revelation today of how much he loves you with every shortcoming with every failure with every bump on your nose or wart on your elbow with with your with your crooked eyebrow with your Hang-Ups with your complexes he loves you you are valuable in his kingdom we know this and we quickly say Amen but to know it changes everything to really know it to really know that God loves you in your Uprising in your downfallen he loves you in your successes and he even loves you through your failures his love is not fickle it's not relative and it's not conditional he loves us unconditionally and because of that we learn to receive love and when we learn to receive love it's easier for us to give love and to express love is anybody with me and so if you can develop a relationship with the Lord where you can not only tell him that you love him but you can show him by the life that you live it becomes easier then to live a lifestyle of Love toward the brothers and sisters so it really goes back your ability to love one another as Christ has loved us it really goes back to an element of whether or not we can receive his love he's good to us folks he loves us you know there might be somebody watching in this service I I I just took a glance and we uh we we just greet all the saints who are streaming Southern Norway uh Indiana Morocco can you imagine someone's watching the service and does regularly from Morocco we send you our love across Indiana across the uh Netherlands we greet the Saints in India and and it just goes on and on and on and and we're so thankful for every person that that has a little part in in what God is doing in this hour I want to just move on in the message why are people so tossed about Jeffersonville he said brother let's get people inside the veil you want to know a little secret he said that's how I conquer wild animals that's how I conquer diseases is by love I'm telling you love must be a powerful force here it must be more than a warm and fuzzy emotion it it it it must be so powerful that it breaks through dimensions a and it reorders the laws of nature isn't that something and you know there's a millennium coming a thousand years of peace with the Lord Jesus Christ where the Bible tells us that the lion is going to lay down next to the lamb and a little child is going to play on the hole of an asp which is the most poison a snake in in Scripture A and A little child is going to lead them and so we know that God has power to conquer even the laws of nature the laws that he instituted and created in the beginning and brother brandom is talking to us here about the ability and we'll get to that in just a moment to conquer even wild animals who are ready to attack and it wasn't a rebuke you know we're Pentecostal uh by birth and we have some of us have come from Pentecostal denominations and therefore the first thing we do is rebuke so the way I was brought up if if if Hornets would have come against me I I'd have rebuked them that's what we were taught if the enemy comes you just I rebuke you go back where you come from you devil you're not going to sting me or or the bull that brother brandom talks about and we'll mention in a minute we would have said you know bull I rebuke you you you lay down there and leave me alone but he didn't teach us that our Victory comes by rebuke he tells us that our Victory comes by love and even diseases are conquered through love so when we're praying for one another if we can remember that love is an activator love activates faith and faith will bring healing and bring Miracles and bring signs and bring wonders if you believe that say amen amen he said the love of God constrains us to do such a thing come in the Veil come in the veil want you today while we bow our heads for a moment of prayer a and and he's coming to an end of the service he's about to pray for the sick and he's reminding people these things come by love so there must be Authority in love the ability to receive God's love and to and to use his love to let it flow through us like a pipeline it must bring an authority in the realm of the spirit are you following what I'm saying it it must bring a boost to our prayers love it must bring authority to the way that we deal with things in that other realm and in that other dimension so love transcends the dimension that we're operating in now the the realm of the natural love transcends the realm of the natural and it moves into the realm of the Supernatural and when the supernatural is activated by faith anything can has to die Anything Can Happen a little baby in a womb that no longer has a heartbeat we can testify to you today that when love activates through faith in that Realm of the supernatural it sends back answers to us it sends back Resurrection Life to us and we can testify that we have seen God bring Resurrection Life not every time but according to his will and his plan we have seen him bring Resurrection Life when the doctor said it's time now to to uh to eliminate what is left of this life and all of a sudden just before a mother's Faith would drop in there and she would say you better check again this has happened more than once around this body and and you better check one more time and then them go back and find that love and faith had trans ascended this natural realm had taken a hold of a promise in the Supernatural realm and had brought it back into manifestation now that's not deep that's how Faith Works you you you you may not even know how it works and you don't have to know how it works just use it we used to sing a song in Pentecost faith faith faith Just a Little Bit of Faith you don't have to have a whole lot you just use what you've got you exercise what God has placed in you because the Bible said to every man is given a Measure of Faith so you take the faith that God has given you and you use it and when you do it becomes multiplied now he goes on in gyrus and Divine Healing and yes I'm going to use uh several quotations this morning and and if you're offended I apologize for your offense but I tell you that there's I don't know of any Minister anywhere that doesn't quote somebody I just happen to quote somebody I have confidence in all right H in in in paragraph 40 uh of gyrus and Divine Healing he said last summer my yard needed mowing so bad and I couldn't know couldn't get nobody to mow it now that bothers me I'm not real good with mowing but I want you to know I'd have wanted to mow it if he needed his grass modow I'd have wanted to make sure it was done wouldn't you couldn't get nobody to mow it God had a lesson in it I guess and I was home on a little vacation and I two weeks I hadn't got out of the front yard with a little power mower put on my overalls and run out starting mow in the yard first thing you know a little power motor Mower and somebody come in I slip around the bat and change my clothes run in and pray for them them and then change again and go out remember one time he told us he kept a little Overcoat of some kind in the garage so he could throw it on because even if he was trying to mow the lawn or do something in the yard people would pull up ambulances would pull up to the front of the house and want him to pray for them and so he said I had to be ready at all times he said uh uh and I'd run in and pray for them and change again and been almost two weeks and the grass had growned up behind me and so I got around behind the house and where nobody could see me and and and I took off my overalls and Sho uh uh shoes my shirt was off real hot and I was mowing I'd forgot about a little old Martin box there that I had and there's a bunch of Hornets in there I don't know what you know about Hornets but that's a little more vicious than a wasp I want you to know when they move through the air you hear them that's what it sounds like they move with such swiftness and such Precision that you can hear them coming and when they swarm you have seen something if you've ever seen we used to have quite a few hornets nest here on the campground and if you've ever seen one and you've seen those Hornets move in and out you'd want to move out of the way and they're deadly they can be deadly if you get uh uh so many stings or certain situations where you could even lose your life he said I forgot about that little Martin box and there's a bunch of Hornets in there and I hid against that fence and I was covered over with Hornets in a few minutes just nothing on top here and the Hornets now little Hornets I love you come on folks that's a little abnormal that's not or remember remember I sister Joyce do you understand what I mean when I say I come from Pentecost and first thing we would have done was in the name of Jesus you foul Hornets go back where you come from brother Brandon wasn't trained that way he said now little Hornets I love you see you're reading ahead I don't want you kiss in me I want you to go right on back in your box where you belong cuz I'm God's servant and I'm praying for the sick people and this grass is growing up and I want you to get away from me and I'm not scared of you now because I ain't got time to fool you go right back in the box he said I just talked to them like that and I just kept on moving and God is my judge I'm going to let you know every one of them Hornets just line right up I just had a flashback to a cartoon I saw as a child and and I saw those hornets and they formed an arrow I don't know if you ever saw a cartoon like that they formed an arrow in the sky maybe that's kind of what it looked like that day he said I'm going to let you know that every one of them Hornets just lined up right like that and went right on back in that box just as pretty as they could go that's right now it wasn't rebuke it wasn't witchcraft somebody tell me what did the what did the work it was the projecting of love when love is projected Sovereign Grace which is the perfect will of God did you know that Sovereign Grace is the perfect will of God when you have encountered Sovereign Grace you have encountered the perfect will of God When Love is projected Sovereign Grace takes over and the will of God was not that brother brandham be be stung by a by a whole uh uh swarm or Hive I started to say her I don't think Hornets heard I think they swarm or Hive or something you know it was not God's will that he'd be overtaken that way and so love was projected and When Love Was projected The Sovereign Grace issued in the will of God now would you would you would you be an experiment would you take that out of here and try it now let me ask how many of you have ever tried it because you know this message you've heard this for years and years how many of you have ever tried something like that when you were in a situation and found that it worked I have when I heard him say that I thought to myself when some people hear things like that they think oh it's because he was a prophet when I hear things like that I think H if God did that for him he can do that for me that's how we're supposed to look at these things and so I've had to use that a few few times and God got me out of some pretty bad situations some of them weren't Hornets with wings some of them were Hornets with two legs and two arms remember when Paul said I fought those beasts at Ephesus he wasn't talking about lions tigers and bears he was talking about enemies that walk on two feet men can come to destroy you and love is the answer it's not rebuke and it's not even that pistol on your leg amen your answer is love and I'm not telling you that we think of that every time we should but we ought to become so used to what God has done in our life and the examples that he has showed us that we would be overcome overwhelmed with that kind of love in a situation like that are you still with me let me read on in another uh message here just a moment when Divine love is projected he said when those Hornets had covered I knew knew that I'd be stung to death in a few moments instead of running or being afraid you know that's the worst thing to do with Hornets because they chase they chase movement so he would have took off and guess what they'd have took off with him there was no Pond to jump into but I know someone who ran from a swarm of hornets and jumped in the pond and waited a while and when he thought they were gone he got out but they were waiting on him and he was severely stung he said I I'd be stung to death in a few moments instead of running or being afraid there's only two elements that you can be controlled by we ought to hear this that's either Faith or doubt you know we've got to believe that if someone came in here to do us harm we've got to believe that if we were at the mall and somebody came to do us harm we've got to believe that if we were in public somewhere and somebody came to do us harm we've got to believe that God's word works and we've got to believe that the that it expression of divine love would execute Sovereign Grace and that God would bring us through because you can't always get to a weapon it sounds to me like God's given us a built-in weapon if we're not afraid to use it he said doubt will accompany and fear will accompany doubt he said Jesus said fear not Don't Be Afraid God keeps his word no matter what condition you are tonight God keeps his word he goes on to tell in closing a few moments he said uh I loved those fellows that seems strange but I did and here's why I talk to them now I do not say that understood me but somebody understood me for I said little creatures of God I've interrupted you you were sleeping and I interrupted you he realized that he had disrupted them all right let's go on he said but I'm a servant of your Creator and his sick children are in my house to be prayed for and I was moving I'm sorry I Disturbed you you ought to hear this because they tell me we've got a real mosquito season ahead of us you might ought to try to practice some of this I know a mosquito is not a hornet but I don't really want to be visited by a bunch of mosquitoes either do you he said I was I I'm sorry I Disturbed you disturbed you little creatures of God in the name of Jesus Christ your creator my Lord hurry back into your house and I will not bother you no more and when I meet you at the Judgment he's talking to the people now not the Hornets those Hornets swarming over me had never touched me as yet they lined up in a single line and went right straight back into their nest love projected Sovereign Grace takes its place that's good now he goes into this story that I want to show share with you as well remind you of seven years I was game warden in Indiana one day while I was putting some fish in the water I don't know why I'm saying these things but crossing a field where a great bull had just killed a colored man and he belonged on the pasture of Mr gery up at Sellersburg Indiana so now you've got the details he said I forgot the bull was in there but there were signs all around do not enter but I had a little old gun that I was supposed to pack and I threw it in the car and I was going across the field over the hill to pray for a sick man that I knew and I was walking through that field not noticing and all of a sudden right down in a bunch of bushes up jumped this big killer and he looked at me he let out a roar he threw his head down and hooked his horns into the dirt and threw them back immediately I felt for my gun it was in the car there I stood alone the fence was about about 250 yards the bull was about 30 yards no trees or nothing I said well here's the end I do not wish to die as a coward but I'll Stand and die as a Christian should die he's giving up and as I reckon myself and that big fella turned around I knew it must be death to be gored to death in a few moments oh he was more than a match for my strength are you getting the picture and I'm thankful I didn't have the gun for something happened oh EXC exuse my emotion but something happened love come down now this may seem strange but it's the truth I talked to that bull now don't let on and act like you've never talked to to a butterfly or a bird or don't act like you've never done such a thing anybody that's gardened has has had to talk to creature and you just go and leave us alone leave me alone he said I Disturbed you this is a killer bull recently killed a colored man he said but I'm the servant of your creator I'm on my road to pray for my sick brother I'm sorry I Disturbed you now you will not hurt me for I love you how can you hurt me when I love you oh I can just feel some folks this is so crazy so forign to some folks but it ought not to be foreign to us we've seen what the supernatural can do he said and here he come I was I was no more afraid of that animal than I am of a Brethren sitting here he come and I just stood there and I said I love you because God created you I Disturbed you and I'm sorry and as he come close to me I Stood Still and he got within about 10t that's pretty close he threw out his feet and stopped and he looked so depleted he looked this way and that way and I said in the name of the Lord Jesus you creature of God's creation go over and lay back down and God being my witness the bull turned around and laid down and I walked in five feet of him anybody believe that I do what was it death was at hand love was projected and Sovereign Grace stopped the bull if sovereign grace through love projected can stop the bull what can it do in an argument what can it do in a house that's been turned upside down by yelling and screaming and hateful words and bitterness what can it do when a husband has gone off on his wife or a wife gone off on her husband or children have gone off in disrespect toward their parents what can happen when somebody recognizes in the chaos and in the turmoil that this is not the answer we're never going to find a solution by yelling we're never going to find a solution in anger but if somebody could remember that love is the key that love overrides the anger it overrides the rebellious nature of this situation it overrides every detail the prophet is telling us these little sto stories so that we understand that even in our situations here come a man we told this Tuesday night here come a man ready to to take him out right on the platform and ended up just falling right down at his feet maybe you've been in a situation where you're being raged at and and and and you you respond in anger and what happens then it just gets bigger and bigger it becomes like a snowball rolling down the hill it accelerates anger accelerates anger hatred accelerates hatred remember he said hatred gives birth to hatred the same way love gives birth to love love reproduces itself in love if we could remember that in those kinds of situations I've told you before there's been a few times in our house when when we would just really be all all arguing at one time time everybody just arguing at one time now nobody's punching anybody you don't have to punch somebody to be violent hello everybody is just mad at everybody and all it took all it took was for Joshua he's the one that God always used in that situation usually to say wait a minute this is not right now who wants to fight keep on fighting then this is not God this is not love this is not how we ought to be acting now let me ask you a question who wants to fight then a few minutes later everybody was saying but I'm right and you're wrong but when somebody calls you out like that and you realize that's not love operating here we're not acting like children of God God we're not behaving like Believers we're certainly not behaving like we love one another all you got to do is be called out a little bit and it just it's it's literally like deflating a a a a a basketball or something you know it's like all the air is sucked out of the situation out of the room and all of a sudden you just say huh what are we doing I'm so sorry I'm so sorry no I'm so sorry I was wrong no I was wrong no I was wrong anybody ever been in a situation like that that's what love can accomplish it's not easy to remember that in the moment you got to have a Joshua you got to have somebody you've got to be the Joshua in your house you've got to be the Joshua in your situation you've got to be somebody that says wait a minute we are not accomplishing anything ugly is about to get uglier we need to remember who we are we need to remember who we belong to we need to remember what God has done for us and we need to act on that are you with me now somebody said I can't relate to Bulls well you could if you was in a in a field with one I can't really relate to Hornets well you could if you'd ever experien but you can certainly relate to a family situation getting out of hand I know you'd like some of you'd like for us to think I can tell by the way you cocked your head when I said that a while ago some of you is doing like this you would like for us to think it's never happened in your place but it does and all it takes is for somebody to recognize what's going on a husband and a wife to recognize this is this is the enemy he doesn't want us to love one another he wants us to hate one another come on he wants us to hurt one another you know it works with in-laws yes did you know it works with in-laws too did you know it works with Outlaws did you know love works with in-laws and outlaws do you know love works in every situation God told us it would sometimes we've got to put it to the test he goes on we didn't quite finish that or did we we did uh flash up the last little part of it again then God being my witness God being my witness the bull turned around and laid down and I walked in 5T of him what was it death was at hand love was projected and Sovereign Grace stopped the bull Sovereign Grace stopped the argument Sovereign Grace let me keep my job Sovereign Grace let me leave the gun under the seat when I could have acted the fool Sovereign Grace kept a a road rage incident from happening in me being right in the middle of it brother I saw your hand I'm not going to go into it it's your testimony TOA but I know I know he knows I know he knows that God can come down in a moment and spare your life and somebody else's life because you're angry why would God do that for somebody that may not even be serving him the way they should because remember God knew us before for the foundation of the world you let Brother David tell you his testimony it it'll shock you cuz you don't know that David the David that he was then is not the one that he is now because that's what oh Hallelujah I'm about to get motional here because that's what Sovereign Grace does yes now okay you you know you you've heard these stories in brother brandom and and some of you have a problem with that anyway and so let me tell you he's not the only one he he's not the only one uh in in 1904 there was a a he's referred to as a Christian Mystic remember that these men didn't know what we know didn't mean they didn't know God it means that many of them didn't know what we know some of them didn't have the right baptism they didn't know what we know Martin Luther didn't have the right baptism he didn't know what we know so if you're one of those who comes to the message and and believes that that we're the only Christians then you're a cult that's not what we teach in this church we believe what the Bible said whosoever calleth upon the name of the Lord shall be saved we do believe there's a message that's been sent for the Bride of Jesus Christ but we believe there's those who are not predestinated to be bride that are saved so we don't throw Martin Luther out because he didn't get it all right we don't throw the Pentecostals out or the charismatics out because they don't always get it right so here was a man by the name of sadu Sundar sing he was 15 years old when he was converted to Christianity through a supernatural Vision that God gave him he was baptized into the church of England in 1905 sing afterward Dawn the robe of a sadu which is a holy man in Hinduism he believed that God had called him to take the message of Christ to the Hindus he believed that he would be more effective in a robe that they respected than in the cloth of the Church of England now you may think that's the craziest thing you've ever heard but remember that I have a a friend who has who believes that he has the same calling and when he came here to minister he wore the saffron robe of a sadu and people have lots to say about it because what people don't understand they often criticize but I've traveled in the nations with him and I know the opportunity that God gave him wearing that robe that God didn't give me dressed the way I was dressed and finally I told him I'm going to have to buy you an Overcoat brother saidu because there are times we have to get through the airport and we don't always have time for you to pray for every person in the airport sometime we have a flight to catch and and he said it's my robe you might you might not understand why the former Amish and uh uh still dress in a plain way instead of like a you know like like you let's just say it like that like you or like me they do it because they believe that God has called them to have a Ministry to the people that he separated them from and that's what made the concrete lady wonder if we were all Amish but we're not but we love our brothers and sisters and they're just like us and they may choose I mean they may choose a bit of a strange haircut but they understand that by doing that they have a lot more likely of an opportunity to witness to somebody in that community so I I caught just a little glimpse of the church dedication in Ohio uh last night and a little bit this morning and there are menites there who who are still wearing head covering and still still dressed like men and I who are hearing some things perhaps they've never heard before and they might not even go down to the local Baptist Church or the local Assembly of God Church or the local message church but they were willing to go there because they knew that the people were plain in their dress and in their nature do you get it so sad Su Dar Singh believed that he would was called to win uh Hindus to the message of Christ but instead of wearing a three-piece suit like the Church of England he continued to wear a saffron robe whether you like it or not that's the way it happened and I'm not here to defend him or to criticize him but you know his his uh his testimony stands for itself are you with me and he disappeared nobody knows what happened to him in April of 1929 he was on a particular mission to Tibet because that in Tibet is where many of the highest orders of the Hindu priests lived and and uh in in in uh community and uh it was treacherous territory treacherous mountains and uh hostile environment and nobody has really ever been able to tell us what happened to him but I want to share with you just a piece of testimony that was written by by a person who knew him very well he said those who red or lived with him not only saw but recorded some of the marvelous events which seemed to constantly take place around him thus a gentleman who later became a YMCA secretary in England wrote of that night which had left him stunned and speechless he said long long after midnight I was roused by a movement in the room the sadu had risen from his bed and was moving toward the door which opened on the wooden stairs outside the little house where they were staying the creaking of the wood made it clear that he was going down the steps and knowing that the sadu spent hours of the night in prayer I was not surprised by his behavior but when half an hour had passed and he had not returned I became uneasy the thought of the leopard that lived in the valley that we had been amply warned about made me feel anxious and so I got out of bed and I looked out of the window toward the forest a few yards from the house I saw sadu sitting looking down into the deep valley it was a beautiful night the stars were shining brightly for a few moments I watched the silent figure of sadu in prayer then my eyes were attracted by something moving on his right an animal was approaching him carefully as it got nearer I recognized it to be a leopard choked with fear now you'd have to read a little bit before this in the story to know that the whole Community had been stirred because a leopard had been coming and taking people out of their beds and consuming them so this was this was a well-known leopard that had the taste of human blood and so he said uh as as it got nearer I saw that it was a leopard choked with fear I stood motionless near the windows unable even to call just then sadu turned his face toward the animal and held out his hand as though it had been a dog the leopard came laid down and stretched out beside the sadu offering his head to be stroked like a common house cat well known in England it was a strange unbelievable scene I can never forget it a short time after that sadu returned and was soon asleep but I lay awake wondering I lay awake pondering what was it what was it that made this man of prayer be able to name the leopard the killer leopard I recognized it was divine love the leopard didn't feel threatened he felt love now I'm not a Catholic but I'm not someone who believes that every person who came to Faith through through the teachings of of Catholicism has gone to hell I believe uh a as as we understand by the message that there are those who come to a certain level of revelation and they they can't get anywhere else you understand it wasn't for them to understand different things so please don't be offended when I mention One More Story like this this happened to be St Francis and when you hear someone say St Francis you immediately think you know well I I just don't even want to hear a story like that you need to remember that when the church ages are being being taught to us the messenger to those early church ages they were products of the Catholic Church they had enough of God in them and God had enough confidence in them that he used them as Messengers to the church age now I don't know that you can get by in this hour with the things that these folk got by with in their day I'm not here to say yay or nay but I want to share Theory story with you again perhaps the most famous story of St Francis is when he tamed a wolf that was terrorizing the people of the city of gobel while Francis was staying in that town he learned that there was a wolf so ravenous that it was not only killing and eating animals but had started now eating people too the people took up arms and went after it but those who encountered the wolf perished at its sharp teeth villagers became afraid to leave the walls of the city Francis had pity on the people and decided to go out and meet the wolf he was desperately warned by the people but he insisted that God would take care of him the bray frier and several peasants accompanied Francis Outside The City Gate but soon The Peasants lost heart and they said they would go no further Francis and His companion began to walk on suddenly the W the wolf appeared Jaws open he charged out of the woods toward the two men Francis the power of God in Francis caused the wolf to slow down and C close its mouth Francis called out to the creature Come to Me Brother Wolf hello you're supposed to smile you didn't it's okay come to me Brother Wolf in the name of Christ I order you to hurt no one and at that moment the wolf lowered its head and lay down at the feet of Francis Meek as a lamb Francis explained to the wolf that he had been terrorizing the people killing not only animals but now humans that were made in the image of God Brother Wolf said Francis I want to make peace between you and the people of this town they will harm you no more and you must no longer harm them all past crimes are to be forgiven the wolf showed its Ascent by moving its body and nodding its head as though it understood the Covenant that Francis was making with him then to the absolute surprise of the Gathering crowd Francis asked the wolf to make a pledge as St Francis extended his hand to receive the pledge the wolf extended its front paw and placed it into his hand then Francis commanded the wolf to follow him into the town and make peace with the town's people the wolf the killer wolf the wolf that had once terrorized The Village followed St Francis humbly quietly into the town by the time they got to the Town Square everyone was there to witness the miracle now these are the ones that had run from him who had been fearful of his destruction Francis gave the town a sermon on the wonderful and fearful love of God calling them to repent from all their sins and then he offered the town's people peace on behalf of the wolf the town's people promised in a loud voice to feed the wolf to take care of the wolf so it never would have to terrorize the town again Francis asked the wolf if he would live in peace under those terms he bowed his head oh this is getting strange for some of you I can see you I see you you know a supernatural people isn't that what we were called to be a supernatural people yeah from that day on the people uh the wolf again placed his paw in Francis hand as a sign of the Covenant as a sign of the pack and from that day on the people kept the pack that they made the wolf lived for two years among the town's people going from door to door for food it hurt no one and no one hurt it even the dogs refused to bark at the wolf when the wolf finally died of old age the people of the village wept the wolf's peaceful ways had been a living reminder to them of the Wonders and the patience and the virtues and the Holiness of God and his servants it had been a living symbol of the power and Providence of the Living God I could go on there are multiple stories in history that that demonstrate to us that when love is projected not fileo love agapo love God's Divine love that's been placed in us when when it has been projected Sovereign Grace has moved in to take over and a whole village was one to Christ a whole village hear this Souls were saved lives were changed because love was projected and and a a wild wolf became a tamed wolf before I lose all of your attention let's go to First Peter for just a moment and we'll close before too long I was told that five pages was all that I needed to bring this morning Benjamin I'm so thankful that I listen to the Holy Spirit first but he's not Benjamin's not always wrong 1 Peter chap 4: 8- 11 and above all things have fervent charity agapo among yourselves for agapo charity love shall cover the multitude of sins use Hospitality one to another without grudging as every man hath received the gift even so Minister the same one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God if any man speak let him speak as the Oracles of God if any man Minister let him do it as of the ability which God giveth that God in all things might be glorified through Jesus Christ to whom be praise and Dominion forever and ever do you see how important love is in Ministry second Peter chapter 1 in verse one read Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord all of this salutation and then all of a sudden he gets to the meat according as his divine power hath given unto us all things the divine power of God hath given unto us all things that attain unto life and godliness did you hear brother gy saying that earlier my home my money anything that that I have I remember I remember my grandfather struggle that was one of the issues that he struggled with he couldn't understand how if he had to go and work for it it was God Who provided it and one day he lost his health and he realized he no longer had the strength to go and work for it he realized it had been God taking care of him so all things that pertain unto life and godliness are given to us by the divine power of God through the knowledge of him that have called us to what strife and contention no argument and fussing no glory and virtue let me hear the Saints amen am whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of what can you imagine that God is calling a people together in the spirit that he wants to share his divine nature with having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust where and he goes on and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue it's not faith and virtue it's faith and virtue and to Virtue knowledge help me and beside this let's go on and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness let's go on and to Godliness brother to kindness and a brotherly kindness charity agapo love for if these things be in you in you and abound if they are multiplying in you if they are abounding in manifestation in you they make you these virtues make you that you shall neither be Barren let's claim that nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ praise God but he that lackthe things is blind and cannot see a far off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins brother vom Drew this out for us uh uh many many years ago can you show us that picture and just refresh our mind can everybody get a hold of that it it's the stature of a perfect man I like to say the perfect man because the perfect man is the Lord Jesus Christ and it is to his stature that we reach it's it's our desire to to find ourselves in in his stature and when God showed it to him he showed it to him like a pyramid add to your faith virtue to your virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance Temperance patience to patience add godliness and then brotherly kindness then he talks about the coming of the Holy Spirit the sealing of the holy spirit that will only come when all of these other elements or all of these other virtues are operating in the life of the believer then that final ceiling not the earnest of the holy spirit that we receive in the baptism but the final ceiling of the holy spirit will come and and so he writes it in the top there and the Capstone the Capstone that comes to to to top off the statue of a perfect man after the birthing of the cealing of the holy spirit it's love it's not human love it's divine love it's perfect love it's mature love does that help anybody to see it kind of drawn out like that and we don't have time but he took it through the church ages Ephesus Smyrna pergamus thyra Sardis Philadelphia and leoda and he also took it through the Stars to the seven churches the Messengers Paul arenus Martin Columba Luther Wesley and then the promised Return of the spirit of Elijah in the last days who would be the seventh Church age messenger the spokesman for the seventh angel of the Book of Revelation so we've got the church ages and we've got the we have the uh also the The Messengers of the church ages notice at the top of the pyramid he the word Jesus was written because he said that is divine love he he is divine love do do I have just a few more minutes thank you in in the message a Blasphemous names this was preached just after the stature of a perfect man he said first foundationally is Faith second add to your faith virtue to your virtue Knowledge from knowledge Temperance from Temperance patience to patience godliness and from godliness or two godliness we add Brotherly Love or brotherly kindness and then love of being the Capstone which we just went through when he is teaching on godliness he said godliness is to be just like God it's to be changed into the image and to the reflection of the Lord Jesus Christ and it's only when a Believer has reached that place that all of those virtues are in him and abounding that he can receive that final Capstone which is divine love he told us without that Divine love manifested in our lives we would not make the Rapture so for you and I to sit and say I'm not interested and all that that doesn't appeal to me it doesn't matter whether it appeals to you or not we must have those things operating in our life to make the body change now who's on board if you knew that it took Divine love if you knew that it took breaking through all of the barriers of humanity to love like Christ loved to love without prejudice to love without respect of color or Creed or Dogma or or background Come On To Love regardless of nationality or social status or economic ability to love like Christ loved if you knew that it was going to take that to make the Rapture how many of you would pursue that kind of love five of us it's much more than the raising of a hand it's a lifestyle and it's active somebody said I could never get to that place not on your own but let me tell you where changes like that take place in the presence of the Lord so when worship is going on and you stand like a cactus in the desert some great Saro when when worship is going on and the presence of the Lord is moving through the place and you remember your dignity more than you do your desire to worship God and you can't even lift up your hand and give God honor which the scripture doesn't suggest it demands you see there's a lot of people that think they can worship according to their personality but the Bible said we worship according to what the Bible says oh I would that men everywhere well I just don't like going over there cuz they clap after the prayer and they clap during the singing and they clap after the sing clap your hands oh ye people shout unto God come on I I just don't like the way they jump around leap for Joy that's what the word said I saw some granny up there dancing praise ye the Lord in the dance that's not some Pentecostal Creed that's not some denominational requirement that's what the word said so if we desire to have all of these things operating in our life Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness and then Brotherly Love brotherly kindness which is fraternal affection it's a Brotherhood the church is not to be a business it's not a corporation the church is to be a living organism it's to be a family of Believers that come together and they may not like each other initially but they learn to because love covers a multitude of sins love covers the weirdness of someone's personality love covers the parts of somebody that you don't like love will make you care for your crazy uncle God yes I don't get much response when I talk about crazy maybe it's a crazy ant maybe it's a real weird cousin or something I don't know but I know you've got them not in my family everybody and you know God put them there that's what you need to know you've been trying to put them out and God's been trying to put them in because we need them it's by these things that we bump into one another how many of you have ever bumped into anybody you bump in and you and the rough edges get knocked off and where these things take place is not at the bonfire and most of all it's not on the volleyball court it's in the presence of the Lord like oil upon his feet like wine for you to drink like water from my heart I pour my love on you if praise is like Spiker if praise is like perfume if it's like rose oil the most expensive oil that I use is what honey uh lemon bomb but what's it called Melissa I've only ever had two bottles of it one I bought and one was given to me and I use it sparingly because it's so expensive but it does so many things for me so I have to find a way to relate to it you know I can't really relate to Mary I I I I haven't live the life that Mary lived so I have to really get into it to kind of try to understand so when I'm looking at this scripture I try to kind of remember my my Melissa oil and and and how I feel when somebody wants to borrow it my wife has asked me on occasion is your Melissa all handy mm it's not handy as in the other room see because it's valuable to me it's not that I can't pull my pennies together and order another bottle but the one I've got is precious to me because it does something for me it helps me so when you're praising you've got to look at your praise like that it's got to be a little bit costly to you if it's comfortable to you it's probably not costly it's when we're able to move out of our comfort zone and begin to pour our love on him my God I want to raise worshippers yes I I do I want to raise worshippers for him if I could be my Ministry I tell you it's really all I I need if I could just raise up some worshippers who will worship Him in spirit and in truth because I know I got to I got to CM myself here I know that it's in the presence of the Lord that all the other stuff melts off it's not how many documentaries we watch it's not how smart we get it's how much time we've it's how much time we're willing to spend in the presence of the Lord it's in that presence that virtue is added to our faith it's in that presence of the Lord he says in paragraph 65 and then love being the calf Stone seven of those things seven Church ages and all of it tempered together oh God we need you I'm sorry I'm I'm feeling a little intercession now in my spirit hallelujah it's all all of it tempered together melted together by the the Holy Spirit we need him he not an it he's not an it now that's what it takes to become a servant of Christ Christ builds his church in the seven Church ages I believe that his bride a person woman Church seven Church ages constitute and make the bride some out of this age and some out of that age and some out of that age and all together shaping like a pyramid meaning steps getting higher and higher and higher as we just showed in the diagram in the message the stature of a perfect man just before the one we just read paragraph 307 he said perfect takes godliness you have to at you you have to add to your faith and remember I explained to you that it comes by a birth it doesn't come by an impartation it comes everything we get in Christ in this last day comes through a birthing process because you've got to have your own personal relationship with Jesus Christ he has no grandchildren have you been born again have you been born again of the spirit of God it's such a question how do I enter into my mother's womb a second time and be born it's not by the natur natural it's by the spiritual that we have this experience do you know what would you answer if someone were to look at you today and say do you know that you're born again there there are those around this message who believe they're saved because of what they believe the Bible tells us that's incorrect you can't say because I believe brother brandom is a prophet I'm born again you can't say because I believe my pastor is a godly man I'm born again you've got to encounter God for yourself you've got to know him in the power of his resurrection and he stands ready if it were what we believed that saved us then the devil is saved because the Bible said that demons believe and tremble you did you know that Devils believe in baptism in the name of Jesus Christ but they're not saved did you know Satan knows that here oh Israel the Lord thy God is one is right but he's not saved because he refuses to obey the word you do know that brother brandham told us that if the devil would obey what he believed we know it's not going to happen but he said if he didn't he was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ he'd no longer be the devil he'd be your brother you've got to understand the the power of obedience and obeying God's word and knowing that you've been changed then you go to knowledge then you go to Temperance then you go to patience and you don't ask for patience you let God birth you through tribulation into patience and then godliness you're getting getting closer now he said oh our time's getting away let's see he said but but you know what godl has meant you've sang this song to be like Jesus to be like Jesus on Earth I long to be like him all through life's journey from Earth to Glory I only asked to be like him he said that's godliness when he was Smit on one side of the face he turned the other you want to know what godliness looks like it doesn't look like you crazy idiot you cut me off it doesn't look like hey I was in line wait your turn godliness looks like you have slapped me on this side I've heard denominational people say it's impossible to treat others like that it better not be because it's certainly weakens the reality of who Jesus is if he can't help you make that kind of a change in your life godlin is just saying hey you slap me over here let me give you another broadside n times out of 10 that'll diffuse the situation we read sometimes these stories of granny's that get broken in on somebody comes to steal their purse and they just start telling them about G you can take the purse just give me two minutes of your time that's right let me tell you the difference that Jesus can make in your life somebody said I just don't believe in that kind of Christianity you know why you've made it an entity you've made it a religious concept instead of the reality of knowing who Jesus is I want to be Godly oh I miss the Mark I'm telling you this is confession time I recognize in this I like my face I I I've never been a person who thought I was good-look so I don't mean that but I like my face I don't like for it to sting I don't particular like to be slapped I always told my children the face is personal space and it's off limits and nobody ought to be in that space I don't want anybody in my face but in order to show his godliness I may be tested in that area Godly always looking for one thing and here it is I always do I can't make that testimony this morning before you that I always do what pleases my father I can tell you that I sometimes do too I sometimes do what pleases my father but in order to be Godly I've got to always do that which pleases the father because that's what Jesus said he was his ministry he said I can't do anything unless my father shows me I can't say anything unless my father would show me there's going to be a bride she's here she's here she's let's go home she's here she's not perfect yet but when I see you all like I see saw you yesterday and like I see you when you're worshiping the Lord that's the image I always want of you when I see you come in here and I know you've got problems on upon problems upon problems when I know you worked so hard as some of you have worked this week long hard hours and yet you come in here on Sunday morning and you've got your you've got your praise on and when I look across this room and I see you in that moment or I see you being kind to one another are loving one another I realize the bride's here she's not coming she's here she's just in the process of being honed I believe the reason why he used the pyramid there are many reasons one is the new Heaven and the new Earth are going to look like that I recently saw a graphic of of the old Earth and I'm not going to argue with you about round or flat but my my thought is just round but the new Earth's not going to look like the old Earth it's going to be completely different it's going to be 1500 miles tall just like the scripture describes but it's going to be more pyramid shaped we see that as we as we approach this message and so that certainly would be a part of it but remember that as the pyramid got taller it gets more narrow it gets honed in you understand more narrow more narrow more narrow and really folks that's what's happening to us that's what's happening to us uh where am I in the same message paragraph 3:12 give me just a few more minutes 130 so I've got to stop but I'm going to be gone a week so I got to make up for it then sixthly let's add the Bible said here according adding Brotherly Love brotherly kindness now that's a good one right here the six seven all right adding brotherly kindness when we get to that brotherly kindness here he explains it so simple it's putting yourself in somebody else's place that's it it's so easy you know all cultures have described it you you you have no right to criticize an Indian until youve walked a mile in his moccasins all cultures have have some expression to help us understand it's it's putting yourself brotherly kindness It's when you can excuse me when you can put yourself in somebody else's place and try to understand why they're what they are it's our desire to want to change everybody and the reality of that is we want them to be just like us you know who we like we like the fundes that are just like us but that's not how we're going to be able to do this we got to be like Christ and what we've got to be able to do is to be able to place ourself in someone else's shoes and instead of letting criticism discourage us from praying for them we need to be able to say but by the grace of God I would also be bitter if God had not helped me I would also be resentful if God had not helped me I would also be jealous you begin to see where people have been it helps you understand where they are and it helps you to love them in spite of what you don't like about them I'm going to ask somebody to squeeze an amen out he said my brother sinned against me said Peter shall I forgive him he said seven times a day Jesus said not 70 not seven times a day 70 * 7 somebody said Oh you mean to tell me I've got to forgive somebody 490 times and then I can hold him accountable no the question was how many times in a day wo I'm preaching and ain't nobody listening come on 400 90 times a day I'm telling you that's a villain if you've got somebody in your life that you have to forgive 490 times every day you won the lottery you've you've got somebody in your life that's going to make you perfect I mean when you come out of this you're going to smell like Jesus and walk like Jesus and talk like Jesus he said brotherly kindness now you see if a brother is All Out Of Tune oh you'll never accuse me of giving only scriptures and quotes that I like I don't like this one if a Brother's All Out Of Tune don't be impatient let's move on it's my biggest struggle I hate excuses I hate when people make excuses just get on get to church on time just do it leave early pick out your underwear the night before let me have a little water musicians you can start this way but I'm being tested here I'm being challenged here brotherly kindness you try to put yourself in somebody else's shoes you see your brother Out Of Tune you see your sister Out Of Tune don't be impatient with him or her be kind oh ouch be kind to him go anyhow somebody said not long ago said how can you believe these things the way you do and still go to the Assemblies of God and the Oneness all the rest see brotherly kindness hoping someday see patient with him temperent enduring with him knowledge to understand what he believes remember it's in his heart that's what is virtue in yourself to let go out with kindness meekness to him having faith that someday God will bring him in see we've treated people who don't believe this message bad bad and it's not the love of Christ hoping someday see you you you do it with love you you go where God opens the door you show kindness and love wherever you are believing that one day God will bring them in brotherly kindness the seventh Thing 1 2 3 4 5 six seven see seventh thing next thing then after those seven things you add charity you add agapo Divine love mature love he said that's the capping Stone and I close with this in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever this this one got me a little bit John after he returned from the aisle of patmas out in the aan sea only thing he could say was little children love one another think about what he went through banished to the island of Patmos which means Patmos in Greek means my killing so he was banished to death to die there were vicious and wild animals that were kept on Patmos because it was a it had been a penal colony it been been a place where prisoners were banished to die John is brought back and burned boiled fried in oil not once history records twice two times he is thrown into a cauldron of burning hot oil they wanted to make a French fry out of John the Beloved the one that Jesus loved remember he comes back from all of these experiences and his message is not the seven Church ages he recorded that he did did his part he preserved it for our generation but that's not what he came back preaching his message was little children love one another if anybody had a reason to be bitter toward people religious people especially it would be John but he came back and his message was what little children love one another he found there was something real and I love the fact that brother Brandon reminds us that was the disciple that wanted to call fire down on the city and burn them up not because they rejected Christ but because they wouldn't feed him somebody said where's that in the bible let me show you before I finish that Luke 9 verse 5455 and when his disciples James and John saw this they said Lord wil thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them even as Elias did but he turned and rebuked them and said ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of so here was the disciple that was ready to burn them up because they wouldn't give him a sandwich now he is sent to Patmos and he comes back and his message is very very simple you'd think it'd be complicated I mean he has seen the Harlot he's seen he's seen all of these visions that we read about in the Revelation I mean You' think he'd be raging against a organized religion you You' think he would be uh pulling up all the evils of of of of denominational systems and and his message is so simple now it has nothing to do with vengeance or judgment his message is little children love one another now back to the finishing of the quote he said but how Christ got a hold of him and let him know you don't know what kind of a spirit you are he said trying to destroy life we've come to save life that's what we have to have is love for one another Lord Jesus we are so thankful that you have loved us on our good days and on our rotten days your mercy your longsuffering your kindness and faithfulness toward us has strengthened and motivated us to run the race and today we are behooved we are compelled we're moved upon to ask for your help in loving each other each other Lord I often say that people come and visit here through the years and they say I I've I've I've rarely seen such a loving congregation and yet Lord we all know we're on the inside looking out and we all know how often we fall short how often we lose patience how often we criticize how often we judge without ever trying to walk in somebody else's shoes and today we just say Lord have mercy would you pray that with me Lord have mercy show us the way of love we are recognizing Jesus that when we get down to the end of all things we're not going to be judged according to how good we explain the Mysteries or how how uh intimately and and and intricately we can diagram the Thunders and what they said but the biggest question that's going to face us is did you learn to love Lord teach us there is no better example than yours you prayed father forgive them they know not what they do Lord I pray that you will allow your little bride to break forth from virtue to Virtue until we come to that place that we can be completely and ultimately sealed and the Capstone can come testifying to the world that you have a people that have moved into the stat of the perfect man who you were when you walk the face of the Earth thank you for grace and mercy thank you for for forgiveness Lord thank you for showing us the way give us strength to keep pressing on in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen let's stand together and let's Worship the Lord let's worship him let's see if we can come one more time before we leave today into his presence and be changed how many of you just say I have things I want his help with you just hold up your hand I have things that I want the Lord's help with I have situations that I need his help with I have I have people I have people that I need his help with and I'm just depending on him he sees that there's no condemnation to you he's not here judging you disciplining you because you struggle he's here encouraging you to come up into Divine love I believe it's for us I believe it's available to us father I see that you draw a line in the sand and I want to be standing on your side holding your hand so let your kingom come come let it live in me this is my prayer this is my plead and father I

truth of baptism in jesus' name she had just a little while left to live cancer had taken her lung and she said now I know I've always criticized that she said I hadn't understood it but she said I want you to baptize me in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I don't want to go out into eternity wondering I want to know I've obeyed the word repent he said and be baptized every one of you in the name and we'll be doing that next Sunday anybody that wants to be baptized can would you pray for us this week a Benjamin and myself and Hawke as we make our final preparation for Africa I've been going for years 30 years to Ghana but I tell you it's a it just seems like a different environment these days and I want to make sure that we've got everything taken care of and all the bills are paid
