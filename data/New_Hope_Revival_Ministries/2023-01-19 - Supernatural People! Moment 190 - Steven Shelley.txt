Description:
We are a supernatural people living in a supernatural hour.  The supernatural realm where God operates is beyond the reach of science and above the natural; it’s beyond human explanation.  It’s the realm where heaven and earth intermingle and intersect.  So when He breaks through in our lives, He reaches from the unseen realm, touches us and impacts us in our realm.  We don’t ever know what moment He is going to break out suddenly and deal with the nagging infirmity, or the breakthrough in our family.  All that has troubled us so long will absolutely leave because our faith has reached a higher level.

The God of Breakthrough promised to move among us supernaturally in 2023, so we should be full of anticipation, be watchful and recognize the supernatural among us.  It behooves us to raise our level of expectation and acknowledge His moving in our lives.
