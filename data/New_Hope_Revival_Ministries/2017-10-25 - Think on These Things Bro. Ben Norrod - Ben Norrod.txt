TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hello I'm brother Shelly from the new hope revival ministries and we are so thankful to have you watching today we are incredibly blessed this week this has been our camp-meeting week and we are off to a good start where we're not even quite to the middle yet but we are off to a really good start the Lord has been moving by his spirit and he has been speaking to us from his word I don't know about you but I find in this last season of my life that scriptures that I have read all my life heard all my life and even preached all my life are taking on seemingly a new and fresh anointing and God it seems as making them so personal and so real to the deepest part of who I am and I'm testifying of that not because I want to brag but because I sense and believe that God is perhaps doing the very same thing for many sincere hearted people across the world perhaps you're one of those the scripture is becoming real to you and richer to you as the Holy Spirit unpacks it and reveals it and we can truly say that these are exciting times trouble sometimes but very exciting times because in the midst of all the turmoil and all the darkness and all the ugly God is raising up a bride to overcome in what we would call Satan's Eden the god of this evil age who has certainly blinded the minds of so many people even as as my mind as perhaps your mind was blinded at one time until the glorious light of the gospel of Jesus Christ penetrated the darkness and took us into a new world who we used to sing a hymn when I was a boy I'm in a new world and really we are when we come to know the Lord and then when God begins to reveal his word to us it's a new world all over again I'm so blessed today to have one of our camp speakers and someone who I have known for many years there were many years that I was busy in in my part of the world and he was busy all over the world but I'm so blessed to be able to say that I've known him for a long time and we have brother Ben nor rod with us today and we're going to get him to introduce himself in a moment tell you a little bit about his ministry and how he was called the ministry it seems like people are always interested to know you know how do you know you're called and and what do you do to step into that call and so he's going to share some of that with us and before we leave you today we're gonna let him go to the word and share some things with you perhaps that he's been sharing with us here that that are are themes that really speak to me in this our God is certainly giving us victory over our thought life and I find that when we can change our thoughts our life is changed there's no doubt about that so brother Ben again thank you so much for being here today brother Ben or rod and where is your home where do you live I live in Manchester Tennessee Manchester Tennessee now I know where Manchester is but I don't know if everybody will know so - what is that close to Manchester is exactly in the middle between Chattanooga and Nashville if you fall to interstate 24 or put your finger right in the center of Tennessee you'll see Manchester low-crawl dead patch out there all right all right I didn't know they were crawdads in Tennessee there are we are incredibly blessed our church I just want to tell you how blessed we are to have your ministry and it's it's I think old-fashioned is a compliment I hope you do I do I feel that way yes thank I know some people use that as an insult sure but for me it's always been a compliment if someone said old fashioned I grew up like you did singing give me that old-time religion yes but you definitely have a ministry that reminds me of my childhood reminds me of the of the fiery evangelists that God would bring to us and the atmosphere I'll never forget the atmosphere and so it's wonderful to be reminded of that and every time you've ministered for us we have felt that would you just share a little bit about your life you may not want to tell your age although you're young enough now not to be ashamed of it but tell people how long you've been ministering and just a little bit about a cerrar I'd be happy to first I want to say thank you to to you and all the saints here in Alabama we've had a tremendous time at this camp meeting this far it's just been extraordinary we're glad to hear that you're a tremendous host tremendous friend and we just appreciate the Lord and your life and the opportunity to come and speak today and to be able to share our life and what we've been through and where we've come from and hopefully a little bit where we're going yeah yeah that's right I certainly appreciate the Lord for what he's done for me I'm 40 years old and if I don't tell you that my bald spot will eventually but I I was I was raised in a Christian home my mother and father was apostolic originally and when they first come to the Lord my mother and father both raised in Tennessee on either side of where they called Monterey Mountain which is just a little old littled hollers out in the middle of nowhere and my my great-grandmother was full Lakota Sioux Indian oh really and so my grandmother being kind of kind of a tough tough woman she was a little short gal about five foot she worked on the railroad and chewed tobacco they drank they didn't think nothing about the Lord in any way Wow and on the other side my mother's people were all free will Baptists originally they'll you know foot wash and shouting madness they used to call it so my dad's people wasn't religious in any way my mom's people were and just by my divine appointment of the way the Lord arranged it my mother and father met together he was he was a center for a number of years when they were first married and mom of course went to church and dad in 1956 he went to a little Apostolic meeting received the Holy Ghost and became a became a Bible believing Christian at that point and then they they really begin to launch out into the deeper things of God right and my brother and my sister my brothers 15 years older than me my sister's 19 years old they they wasn't really planning on having any more children but my mother began to study the Bible about the woman being the betting ground of life and she said the spear the Lord moved on her and when he moved on her he spoke to her specifically about you need to have another child this is about 1975 dad of course he was a little you know if he about it cuz dad was 42 he and mom was my age and so she just began praying and the Lord finally dealt with Daddy and and they they attempted to conceive the first attempt brought a miscarriage which was in 1976 for me when I come in 1977 March of 77 was when I was born my mother had one complication after another and actually the doctors tried to get her to abort me they said that you'd say lost cause he'll be Down syndrome he won't be it won't be right and I had a short umbilical cord anyways and so I wasn't really a healthy baby while mom was caring she was very sick and there was a minister there in Ohio that that laid his hands on mama to pray for one night when they thought they would lose me and he prayed this prayer over my mama and they didn't know whether I was a boy girl or anything like that and so he just prayed and said father this man this does this man child that's that's within our sister I want you to raise him up to be a minister to carry the gospel to the world Wow so this was the prayer he prayed from the beginning so here mom tell those stories all my life you know I always felt like the Lord had a purpose for me and I I believe my life was sanctified for the purpose of the gospel because when I was six years old I had my first experience with the Lord my mother and father they came from Apostolic in 1968 they heard about a man by the name of William Branham and they heard that there was a prophet in the land and they desired to know more about it and there were some friends of theirs that had some recordings and had some books of this Brannen and they begin listening and they follow what people identify is what they say the message of that day the message of this time so they begin following brother branham's ministry and it took him to another level in scripture all together and it just took him to another level of serving God all together and my mom began to read the Bible about women having children that were priests and things and so she began to tell me you know I think the Lord's got something for you son you know and when I was six there was a minister that laid his hands on me and it was the first experience that I ever had of a touch from the Holy Spirit I remember it specifically when the man laid his hands on me there was just a feeling washed over me and I remember this clean type feeling like something had moved on me I didn't know what it was I didn't know it was Jesus I was too young to even be able to really identify it but that was my first experience with the Lord when I was 12 I fell under great conviction and in my pastors church at the time I uh I was becoming a very mean little boy and I I was mistreated I guess in a lot of ways and I developed a real hatred in my heart and at 12 at 12 12 I just was beginning to really the the feeling toward people and I know a lot of it was just misunderstanding things not understanding life having older parents sometimes there was a disconnect in the generation things were happening they couldn't explain and there was a lot there and and I remember at 12 sitting in the pew and conviction striking my heart and the only thing I could think is I just want to be a good little boy hmm I'm a bad little boy so I just want to be a good little boy I went to the altar of course and asked my pastor to pray for me and the spear of the Lord just wonderfully and beautifully washed over me and cleanse me of that feeling and it is what I know now as being saved right yet as a venn I hadn't really received the Holy Ghost so there was little things still at working in my heart and as I grew toward 14 which is when I received the Holy Ghost I begin developing even greater hatred those things just got worse and intensified and you know the bulk of my testimony that I share with people around round the world one I'd want to tell them I was one of those kids that would sit in church with such hatred that if you crossed me in any way whatsoever I would try to figure out a way of my brain how was gonna kill you I would think of some way of mutilation or something that much yes sir yes sir it was it was such a tremendous feeling of hate I still remember toward toward anybody in a ward anybody and everybody didn't matter they matter if they crossed me or not eventually got to wear you know just the look of them if they looked a certain way at me and there was a feeling there such that so I was invited at the age of 14 to West Milton Ohio to the to the youth camp that brother was putting on there and you were invited to speak at this youth camp well I remember yes sir oh yeah you know it was a tremendous time because first and foremost I believe it was one of the one of the milestones for the people of that area because it was a tremendous revival in the beginning anyways from the first service that you preached the Holy Spirit was moving greatly amongst the people and many of my peers that that someone still serve the Lord to this day we're in those meetings got saved in those meetings and I I never will forget as you come to the close of the meeting you preached a message called a House of Hell giveaway and you were telling a little story that brother Branham had conveyed in a vision he'd had about people being bound in a prison house you read from the book there where he talked about the woman caught him and kissed him and her way is the way to the house of hell and so people at the end of the service were jumping and shouting and jerking and wailing and it scared me mmm because for the first time in my life I realized that there was something in the room that could overpower me and for me the the hatred and the things that I built up in my heart was an empowerment because really as a young man I was developing a terrible inferiority complex and I I just I just felt empowered when I could hate but for the first time in my life I felt overpowered and I felt weak and it just really brought me down to a place where I realize III better get right or I'm on my way to hell Wow and it scared me so badly that I stood up and actually started to walk out of the sanctuary and my father who had been watching me he was standing off to the side he'd come around just shortly and and my grandpa was Benny Albert so he calls me Benny he said where you going Benny I said dad that scares me to death III I don't I don't I don't why he said don't run from it run - oh wow the next morning what good advice all such a beautiful thing the next morning we we had service and what they call the little Tabernacle about maybe 50 kids in there and it was actually the last year that my age group was permitted to be in the tabernacle that morning and I was blessed to know that later because I know God orchestrated that just so I could be in that meeting you were preaching Satan you can have my coat but she can't have me you remember the title I remember yes sir yes sir absolutely and I've remember you describing about Joseph you told a story about a young man who had got into a car wreck and in your story you told about this young man having hate in his heart and you didn't realize it but you were describing me to a tee and how this young man needed to get saved needed to get right well as they say that was where the nail was clinched and I walked to the front I still remember standing to my feet and walking to the front and my hands immediately flew into the air I began crying and weeping and the words was I love you Jesus I love you Jesus I love you Jesus huh you have to understand but Steve there wasn't anything I loved mmm I had such hate in my heart there was no love in my heart was so am i but the sphere of the Lord got ahold of me and that's all I knew I tell you this quickly because this this is a little side note but it's always been so precious to me there was a younger boy there who who I'd been terribly mean to that week I'd step on his foot and push it around and calling names and all kinds of things I was just a rascal to this kid and if he if he hears this I hope he still forgives me but I am I never will forget when I was standing in the altar and the Holy Spirit was filling me with the with the blessed presence of Almighty God oh it's an experience I want to relive it every day of my life if I can everybody needs it yes sir absolutely absolutely and I felt two little hands wrap around my waist and I looked down and there was that little boy oh my Stanny with tears in his eyes he had been praying for me that God would save me Wow so that that's that's my beginning that's how I got started oh the theme that year was going into the world preach the gospel and shortly after that and I do mean shortly just a few weeks afterwards I was sitting in the church and listened to the sermon and the Holy Ghost moved to me and spoke to me and told me I want you to preach and I thought well that's just me thinking that Joshua desires do something for the Lord so that's just me probably thinking that well I always tell young men and men of any age really that asked me about preaching and it's all about a call yeah I said well I didn't have an angel show up and I didn't have you know a lightning bolt hit me on top of the head but there's one thing I know once he spoke to me it increased and increased and increased in never let up Wow and it moves so strongly on me that I couldn't sleep I couldn't eat I couldn't do anything until I responded to that for that's the call and that's that's how I knew and I tell him honey if it's a real call to God you'll go to the stump and preach to the squirrels okay if you got it you know brother Ben I I've told this a lot of times my granny used to say something that I didn't understand at the time and now I think I do she used to say if you feel like you're called to preach she said you ought to run as hard as you can in the other direction do everything you can to get out of the call right and I thought I'm high that I don't know if that's good advice or not but then she would finish it by saying because if you're really called you'll never get a away from exactly right matter how hard you ruin exactly and so that's that's encouraging to hear that it just increased yes in your life until surrendered how many years ago was it that you would just SEC preaches your first sermon 26 years yeah I was 14 years old as 1991 and my first sermon was in a nursing home actually brother the brother there in Ohio that had he was real sensitive young men and trying to help him preach and things and he had actually organized kind of a little um I guess you would call it a tryout in a way in my mind it was kind of a tryout and there was a few brothers there that that had felt a call to preach and and so actually was prior to the nursing home neither thinking so we went into this little Sunday School room and I my first sermon Peter where for did you doubt and I talked about petered out and you know falling down Jesus catching his hand you know and then I turned it around where did you doubt you know it you know what we have the same God he's still in on the water and in the bus right that was pretty impressive for a tryout sermon anyway thank you well it was it was a blessing and then the brother of course he felt like the Lord really done something for me and this is the same man that laid his hands on mama and had prayed that prayer yeah so of course me not knowing that a hundred one hundred percent just that way until many years later I found out it was this brother indeed that prayed that prayer I never really knew who write and just a year so go I I had the privilege of being able to shake his hand and ask him do you remember praying that prayer he said yes I said do you remember what you said he said yes and I just hugged his neck and I said this day that prayer is fulfilling just exactly right and so after that he put me in the nursing homes and then I started preaching there to some of the older folk and and you know most almost bound in wheelchairs and then the Lord would do such powerful tremendous things amongst the elderly we would see him maybe go from the wheelchair or from being even bound in the bed up to a wheelchair unto a walker up to a cane which was tremendous for 95 years and encouraging absolutely so we saw those things in the beginning man it just built our faith and then eventually you know just staying under a good pastorship and staying with the word studying the Bible and making sure we knew where we were we just the Lord increased the Lord opened up doors and as he increased we just kept moving and and now it's become around the world at least one time for me in the last 26 years traveled a lot do you know how many countries you've been there 10 this foreign 13 yeah that's a lot I mean it really is a lot of countries plus you've traveled across the United States oh yeah multiple times oh yes sir yes sir I mean you were just in Connecticut before you came here that's right here I thought you were driving from Tennessee to get here and you drove all the way from Connecticut and when you leave here you've got a long distance to go that's true yeah and so for now you've most of this 26 years you've been fulfilling the commission of an evangelist yes sir yeah yeah mostly yeah I had a little home church for about three years in Ohio we we was in an area where there was a lot of backslidden people and so we worked an area there for about three years trying to reach out to them it was it was a little successful but a little bit more unsuccessful than what I'd hoped we just couldn't get the response we wanted and I was actually on my way back home to my home church when my now pastor in Tennessee had approached me and asked me to come help him there in Tennessee so in May of 2003 I moved to Tennessee and that's when I began full-time ministry which was 14 years ago this May and so before then you were working a little job or doing something yes sir full-time yeah that's right that's right yeah yeah that that's really an incredible track record and you know the best is yet to come and that's what we believe yes sir yeah can I just share with those who are watching one verse of scripture that you preached from last night and can I get you just to take off a little bit I bet just just to speak a little bit about about the mind and the thought this is found in Philippians chapter 3 and it's not it's not one of those more remote verses of scripture it's one that we're more familiar with you know I've seen it on greeting cards and things like that and and so maybe it has to become a little more common than it should but how powerful it can be when the enemy is bombarding our minds yes it is chapter four actually Philippians and verse eight finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things tremendous works you share with us about this verse and wherever else you decide to go with yours when I look at this particular verse my mind really it it opens up to to a channel of thought that is not just important I think for Christians but it's important for Humanity right people the and it's it's something that really everybody's acquainted with that is the battle of the minds right and you you see help self-help books you see psychology you see a lot of things working in the way of well you know how do we better ourselves is it positive thinking or is it these type of things and I believe that one of the great mysteries of humanity and if humankind has been what the mind is all about yeah because there are aspects of the mind that a lot of people don't understand right for example with science for a long time couldn't understand why Jesus said as a man thinks in his heart right I said well he thinks it as hard well we don't think in our heart we think in our brain but then they come to find out that that's true that there's a part of us that actually thanks from a different realm than the brain and it is a it is an important thing I believe to really focus in on the beginning of matters of circumstances right and everything begins with the channel of our thinking before a person can even express words it has to enter into the mind first before a person can really make decisions and execute decisions it must come from the realm of meditation of thought and what we put into our minds will be the output of our lives oh yeah and we study and what we how we we view things or how we look at things our vantage point of life it all comes from the mind and Paul here being a great to me Paul was more than just a prophet more than just an apostle but he was a man called of God to really hone in on the primary issue of humanity in Revelation 1 when he starts talking about John starts about the seven personnage of Jesus every every aspect is human human nature the voice of waters that's preaching and the feet of brass the judgment begins at the house of God and Paul was very gifted in being able to go into that element of humanity and pull out those components and show the human side mixed with the Christian side and how both of them work in in tandem the amazing thing about this particular verse is that some people would look at it and say well it's positive thinking actually it's not this is more than positive thank more much more to me I I believe Michelle had that to me this particular verse is speaking to us as believers being able to take the word and put it in the channel of our thinking if Jesus said the word is a seed and we know that it is then the seed must have a bedding ground in order to grow properly and our minds or our thinking is the bedding ground for these for these thoughts and so at whatever a person thinks whatever a person has in their mind that's gonna be what they meditate on what they dwell on that way is gonna be what they manifest it's amazing just just recently with the Las Vegas shootings there's still to this moment trying to get inside the minds actly of the man they don't understand why he did what he did but one thing we know from Scripture is that somewhere there had to be a meditation there had to be something that went over and over and over again in the man's mind to create such evil just just at a moment's spur almost and to to you you know move to such a realm coming by the power of thought well Paul is exhorting us that just as that is negative we can on the positive side we can channel the word in such a way that whatsoever things are true that's powerful and a virtue and of power we can manifest things out of our life through the power of thinking and Peter exhorts us to gird up the loins of our mind and I think it's important to really understand that gird means to well their garments used to be long and flowing they would take straps and time down if they were gonna do work or they were gonna go to battle or what are they gonna do and Peter tells us to gird our minds right because the mind of people today is just it's carte blanche they can think whatever they want run away really completely absolutely completely and there's no real subjugation there's nothing in their minds that really kind of focuses them down on what is true which is what Paul exhorts us to do here find what is true and thank upon these things now the word that Paul uses here for thank is luigi's MO which is where we get the word for a calculation and for reckoning and those type of things so it's more than just a passing thought but it's actually being able to take that and calculate over and over and over and over again and even children when they're learning their ABCs the power of repetition ABCD efg it's the same thing he's saying here so don't just think on it but actually repetitively over and over and over again and taste so just meditate to say absolutely right Wow because if we put all that good in eventually Goods gonna come out yes yes keep going yes sir that's right that's right and so to me I think it's it's important to really to put a little focus to on what Jesus said that as a man thinks in his heart so is he what our thoughts are is what our character is going to be take a person that meditates on depressing type things or even if they're sick in their body and you know how it is when you start getting sick absolutely you're thinking I'm sick I'm sick I'm sick that thought is in your mind but I do believe that if we can push out them thoughts and it will take God's grace and it will take us surrender ourselves to the Holy Spirit to get to the place to where we can really push we can't do this on our own strength no the devil is too powerful in himself too convincing he has too much understanding in biblical things he's too smart too shrewd for us to try to whip him with her own brain right but with the grace of God moving in our hearts and surrendering ourselves to truth then we're having the ability then to say Lord now I surrender my thoughts to you as quoting last night a certain spot of science that said 70 thousand thoughts crossed through the average human brain you know and that's that's just exponentially speaking that just grows and grows and grows once you get past is that in the course of a day one day one day Wow then by day two it's a hundred and forty thousand and then you just keep doing the math I mean it's incredible to think about the battlefield of the mind because the mind is it's the place where Satan wants to go before he goes anywhere else it was where he went in the Garden of Eden right he went to Eve's mind he began to work on her through thoughts through the power of suggestion exactly which is dangerous yeah suggestions always got to be brought back to the word to make sure it lines up with the word that's a very good statement people people have a lot of problems with suggestive behavior yes yeah suggestive thinking and people can send messages without saying a word that's true because the mind can get a hold of it just like that there's a certain book I read of fella by name of Martin Lindstrom and he talked about the power of marketing and just the human brain and how the brain and marketing go together and he spoke about how that a man looking at just a red race car or a red the type of fading out sunset by looking at that if he was a smoker would automatically think about Marvel cigarettes without even the word being put before him because that's like the color of the package or something exactly Wow this is the advertisement they use they use racecars and sunsets and these type of things so it's like association exactly and that suggestion sent the message without even putting words in front of them that's pretty interesting and that's where we are today the mind is bombarded was suggestive ideas I mean you can look at Facebook you can look at Twitter you can look at all these things that are out there today social media of every kind not to mention television not to mention radio or any kind of media has the ability to send messages to us even though it may not say a specific thing the devil uses that but that's why that is Christians we must bring our minds back to this word because then Jesus tells us let every man's word be a lie but let mine be the truth right and then that's what Paul said here whatsoever things are true she's assigned the truth and I am the life so in order to get to truth as Pilate asked Jesus what is history we got to know what the word is is truth that's what we're supposed to meditate upon it it would be easy for us in this day and age to meditate upon all the negative there's truth there tons that's exactly right and it gets worse every year and and it's not going to get any better it'll get worse and worse and even what the Bible tells us that evil men and seducers and things of that nature will wax worse and worse plumb to the coming of the Lord Jesus and it'll come to a place to where that it'll be as it was in the days of Noah I think we've already arrived where the imagination of every man's thoughts yes are already on evil yeah they can't think anything good because they're always meditating on the evil side but that's why the Paul gives us such a beautiful commandment here to think to calculate to reckon to compute keep these things going in our mind all the time about what the Word teaches us if you think you're an overcomer you'll be an overcomer if you can thank in your mind and it's not so much mind over matter as much as it is surrendering our mind to the word that's what makes the big difference which of course we have to be familiar with the word yes be able to replace our negative thoughts with the word absolutely so let me understand you're you're sharing that thinking on these good things pure things lovely things it's not automatic in other words you're teaching us that it is a calculated decision yes sir absolutely that we have to choose rather than thinking on all of the other things that that we say the enemy but a lot of it is the enemy is using me sure is and even entertainment you know thinking about what people call entertainment and and how that that a lot of people walk away from from modern entertainment depressed or angry or upset absolutely and and I thought by definition that to entertain was to us to please you know to it to make someone happy and to feel good one would thank you but really entertainment today is not always about that it touches every emotion and I think it can leave people in really a bad place certainly so really we need to be filled with the Word of God and we have to understand that it is a decision to replace absolutely to reject a negative thoughts what what about what about Satan's accusations I mean certainly he's constantly whispering Sharia so how do we handle he wants to disqualify us he accuses us how do we how should the Christian today handle that constant bombarding accusation from our enemy certainly III look at that kind of through the life of David you know as far as a man that had as much complication in life as a fellow could have David had it not only did he have whisperings from the kingdom but he had you know he had quite a few wives and children to deal with at the same time and he had a lot of problems and the devil was always working on David in some way the book of Psalm Psalms really gives us a view a real good setting into how that a man can train his mind or a woman for that matter into into blocking out the noise because to me I think the the key of really getting our mind quiet is we have to learn to quieten voices for example a person that falls into depression and I'm sure that there'll be people that will view this little talk and they'll be able to relate with the fact that they've been so deep they've considered suicide they've considered sure some violent act of some sort because if they really just stop and think for a moment there's so much noise going on in the brain so much what the psychology calls self-talk and they're constantly talking to themself about certain things I could say from my mouth to you oh I'm fine but my self talk will always tell the truth on Wow inside of me I'm saying but no I'm not you know I'm not really fine well and that that's what we have to get down to is we have to learn to listen to the one singular voice that will drive out all the noise and we kind of have to listen to ourself a little bit you know not what we say but what we're thinking in ourself we have to kind of stop and take time to really kind of listen at our own heart and and what do I really believe about me yeah and then take what we believe and see if it lines up with the word because the devil is a liar I mean bottom line Satan never going to tell you the truth if he comes with no truth that's twisted in some way anyways so really really we have one measuring stick and that's if we can bring things back to the scripture to identify what is real truth again to say what is truth now by that but that being said here's where I think it really gets complicated for some folks because we don't want to work hard enough sometimes as Christians to get ourselves down to that place to where all the voices are drowned out it's too hard it's too much if it seems like work it's very much work absolutely and so some people just give up but I will say that with some presence and with some determination and consecrating your heart and dedicating determining in your heart that you want to know what is right then then I think that as each voice would come taking that voice going back to the Bible okay says Satan says I'm not saved but then going back into acts 2:38 repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost if I've done that right if I've met God's requirement well then I can just shut that voice off not listen to it anymore meditate upon that I've done what God said God's obligated to his word he'll do what he says in his word he's the same yesterday today and forever and as we meditate on that it quietens that other voice out exactly I mean yes it's the same thing with sickness for example if you're thinking I'm sick I'm sick I'm sick your self-talk is I'm sick but if you'll just say his stripes I am healed by His stripes I am healed by His stripes I am healed and you just keep that thought in your mind eventually it'll quiet not that other voice and so the word has that kind of power Wow the word will absolutely push out all of these other thoughts because light always scatters darkness anyways and always pushes it off into a corner exactly and it's difficult it's not an easy task it won't happen today it won't happen tomorrow you know I really like something that you said the other night I don't think it was in the in the sermon particularly about thoughts but you said something about making baby steps and making steps yes how important is that in a situation like this where it begins to feel like work yes you know if I'm gonna wrestle every thought that I have and I'm gonna submit it to the truth of God's Word I'm gonna be busy that happened 70,000 times a day absolutely and and so people I think I mean myself I've gotten overwhelmed when I knew the enemy was trying to steal my joy right and you start confessing with faith the right things and and then you you're quiet you're not thinking good thoughts or speaking good words the next thing you know all that negative comes back you can feel the joy leaving again so you feel overwhelmed and discouraged but what I've learned is if I will be consistent exact with the small things exactly so talk just a little bit about those those making small steps certainly you know and that can be encouraging if you see some measurable results sure absolutely I think it's very encouraging to know that this is a race this is a marathon it's not a sprint yeah it's a marathon it's a long term long haul and what we have to realize I think is that sometimes our faith doesn't latch in the beginning I heard a story one time about a woman who couldn't have a baby her husband wanted one she couldn't have a baby and so she adopted a baby and after just maybe a year or two years of taking this small child and mothering this child doctors found out that it gave her confidence that she could actually reproduce herself and within a couple years she actually did that and so I like to call it the adopted baby route and I say that if a person if their faith can't get it at first if they'll just take the adopt just put the word in there and just keep going and going and going and confessing and speaking hallelujah and not back up and not back up that's the key the minute you back up Satan's on you like white on rice and and you can't do it you just got to keep pressing forward if you ever stop that's where you fail because the Bible tells us give not space yes you know granny said give him an inch he'll take a mile it's bigger than that now sir oh yeah yeah I mean yeah I that is so powerful so so the results of the story is that by by having confidence I have I can mother sure I can nurture sure you're saying that the testimony is that that had a absolutely effect on her solutely yeah because the confidence builder was was the thing that helped her body come into the reproductive cycle you know dad no comment that's not just standing in the mirror in front of mirror and saying you know I'm good-looking I'm I can conquer everything you know hey you good-looking thing I can make it today we're not talking about just what some people might call unrealistic realities or unrealistic optimism that's mind over matter right but we're talking about taking God at His Word absolutely yeah it's some somehow important to to recognize that there is an answer for every situation we face in God's Word yes but it will seem like just words on a page right without the Spirit of God to reveal it and make it real to us that's I wanted you to talk for a moment about how much more effective it is when you're when you're battling the enemy or overcoming thoughts with a revelation absolutely instead of just you know looking for a verse to read and and just trying to speak it even though you don't believe it there is a an element of faith well certainly yeah and I think first for everybody think it comes mentally first it comes through that kind of dryer channel of I hear it okay it's words and but I think that it comes to a place to where we have to we have to start building our faith by just just believe simply believe and it's just a common regular belief just simply like you get in your car you start your car because you got confidence that's going to start yeah you walk down the road and and and and walk into a store and say hello and you're not worried about whether you're gonna make it home or not you just got regular central faith automatic and you just do that with the word you just you just tell yourself initially and you have to talk to yourself you have to tell yourself okay this is God's Word and I'm gonna believe it with all of my heart and then I think once and here's the key once you make a commitment to the Lord and God sees that you're serious about what what you what you're reading about what you're studying then I feel the Holy Spirit answers back to that because for all of us it starts kind of just by reading or hearing even in the book of Romans he talked about you know you hear the gospel you hear it through preaching but it but faith faith cometh by the hearing of the word Wow so as we hear it as we read it as we study we make a commitment that this is God's for exactly Drive our doubts out and then I feel the Holy Spirit answers back to that then the Bible tells us that once Christ sees our commitment because remember in in Ephesians 1 Paul talks about after you heard the word of truth right you were sealed with the Holy Spirit Brian right so you hear it first you make a commitment to what's right first you dedicate and surrender yourself to what's right first then the Holy Spirit answers back to that by the by the baptism of the Holy Ghost once that happens in a person's heart once they're saved once they're filled with the Holy Spirit once all of the doubts and things are drove out of a man's heart woman's heart and Christ enters in there then he begins to speak revelation to you oh that you didn't understand I'll give you an idea what revelation looks like if I use the word board just the English word board could have a bunch of different meanings it could be plank board it could be committee board Deacon board it could be somebody sitting in church on board has many meanings to it but revelation is is if me and you before I said board somewhere privately I come to you and I say brother Steve I'm talking about a deacon board oh well then I come out and say board right well other people can draw thoughts but you know directly what I mean because I spoke it to you and I feel the word is the same way it's a good point once a person enters into the Holy Ghost once they make a commitment to the truth and they make a commitment to serve God then God starts answering back through his word and reveals to them what the meaning of it is what the thought even is behind what he says that's why we have so many different organizations and things because man puts his own thought to what he thinks right but when the word is being revealed to a person you can see things in the scripture that other people can't see you can understand what holiness is you can understand what baptism is Sam in the Lord Jesus you can understand the Godhead you can understand deep things of the scripture because the Bible said you have a spiritual mind comparing spiritual with spiritual right yes not carnal with spiritual but spiritual with spiritual that's a difference and commitment is the main thing if a person will commit themselves to the word and fully commit their heart to the Lord and said Jesus I believe this is your word and with all of my heart I commit myself to it yeah I believe God answers back and I think that's the real key of getting us there it all comes the same way we all have two years hopefully and and we all hear it on our eardrums and so forth and but there has to be a real commitment in the person's heart if they let go and let God then the Lord Jesus will do a work for them that they can't do there's nothing we can do ourselves we used to hear people talk about seeing themselves in the word you know realizing that it's not just for God so loved the world but it's God so loved me he asked me man what what what role do you think that plays now I mean and how do we get to that place yes that we can see our sail in the word sure I think first we have to take the word personally I think we have to realize that the Bible wasn't wrote to just people but it was wrote to individuals that it's a love letter that Jesus would write to an individual and it is similar to a story that I heard told many years ago there was to two people on a ship sailing down the ocean man by the name of John Court neither one by the name of William Tell John Court was dying he's an old ship captain and he was a sinner but William Tell was a Christian and he heard him reading his Bible and he said hey he said that sounds pretty good to me he said he said I'm awful bad shape I need some help William Tell said to John Court would you like me to read the scripture the way my mom already read it said yes he was reading Isaiah and he said by His stripes William tail would tell was healed by hit you know and so forth like that John said can you read my name in there he said I'll try so he said by his stripes on court he how I see it I see it and the Holy Ghost healed him I think the key is is that you have to take it personally you have to realize that when it says you y-o-u that's talking to you when it says us you got to put yourself in there if you're not willing just to see yourself that way God can't show you that way you have to be willing to see it first it's easy for people to say oh that's good for somebody else right but you and and brother I really personally believe that we have to be aggressive when it comes to these things because the Bible said the kingdom of God suffers violence and the violent take it by force hey we must be aggressive with these things if we just passively well maybe it's that way sort of it'll never make the grade you have to be so aggressive in there and say hey that's talking about me a thought comes no it's not shove it out that's talking about me if we're aggressive enough and I believe if we we push to for that commitment and we push to be committed then I think the Holy Spirit honors that I believe God honors that and one thing's for certain is that when a person wants to see themselves in the scripture if there's a desire in them to see it then God's the only one that could have put that first place yes and so he already sees that that desires there so everywhere they look he's going to show it to him because I believe the Bible is like a looking-glass yeah and I believe if we look and we're really looking right we can see it but there's a little something about that do we have time to share us that was in the book of James when he talks about a man beholding his reflection and then he goes away forgetting what manner of man he is to me this kind of ties in to the commitment part to prezerv Verint to being aggressive the the historical version of that when you look at different men that wrote about this particular looking-glass it wasn't as of today we have mirrors at eye level and we pretty much can go around our house and see our reflection everywhere but in this time period they actually placed the mirror on the ground oh and so for a person to see themself they had to stoop down all the way to the ground in order to be able to catch the reflection so when they stood back up then of course they would forget what manner of man because they didn't have things at eye level so the only way to see it again you had to stoop back down this is what Jesus told us and this is a big key and what we're talking about this afternoon if a man will humble himself as Peter said humble yourself therefore under the mighty hand of God he will exalt you in due time but you have to humble first and if a person is not willing to kneel and not willing to humble themselves and lower themselves so that they can look in the word to see themselves they'll never really see themselves but then the Bible goes on the st. James tells us that as a man continues to behold himself even Paul said we look through a glass darkly but eventually we begin to see where the reflection comes clear we remember what our nose look like remember what our ears look like remember the features of our face the characteristics of our hair and what right and it comes through humility humbling ourselves down and to me the best way to see yourself in the scripture is at the foot of the old rugged cross right kneeling down to see Jesus who was crucified Jesus who gave himself for us the highest of the high became a foot wash monkey yeah the lowest of the low to be spit on to be called a dog to be called everything that was to be called and yet that great savior a man come all the way down and stooped stooped all the way down so that he could exalt and that's what we have to do it's easy to say well I'm just gonna take the Bible and just memorize some scriptures that's true you can do that that's possible if you've got the human instrumentality you can do it but it takes that element of humility to humble yourself to a Bible that may rub you the wrong way a little bit it could you sure enough and scriptures that make kind of pinch you a little bit from time to time exactly there's things I read in here when I was a boy and and and hey hey man I knew I knew I wouldn't line it up but I humbled myself to it I said God this is your word you know what's best for me you have my best interest in your mind so I'm gonna follow that to the best civility by stooping down by humbling myself by putting myself last making sure God was first because that's what the Bible says seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these other things will be added if we're not willing to humble ourself to the word we can never be exalted we can never achieve that place of seeing ourself in the word and saying hey I'm one of them I'm one of them it takes humility it takes a commitment it takes being aggressive it takes being able to dedicate ourselves and it takes a little precedence if we're not willing to fight for it we'll never earn it because the crown doesn't come to those who just set and receive and the battles worth it i mean the the victory that's promised amen and even the victory that we feel when we overcome something that the enemy has put us through or put us in or and walked into stumbled into and when we overcome it it's worth it yes sir absolutely an eternity it will really be man that's right I think our time has probably come to an end for now but I tell you this is this is going pretty fast for me I've enjoyed listening to it thank you and I mean that and it's inspiring and it's true and it's the word and it works thank you my brother my heart keeps going back to to the anger yes that you had when you were a child yes and I don't know how severe the things were that you encountered in life but it sounds like the anger that you had was was probably in proportionate that maybe it was even over the top an added measure to anything that you experienced that would have made you that angry certainly and I think that anger is all around us that's right I think that it explains a lot of what's going on in the world and I just sense that there are probably people watching this today who who fight that kind of anger maybe even even it's really mean you said that you had a touch from the Lord and as a child and and you you knew there was something real and yet that anger was there and even increased certainly so there may be someone watching this who has confessed the Lord Jesus as their Savior who has started a Christian journey maybe been walking a journey for a long time and still dealing with that anger I'd like to ask you to look in that camera and pray I will and and agree and I'm gonna agree with you because I would like to see people free I I think that anger and and a temper like that it eats you from the inside out along with unforgiveness and all the other other absolutely you know things that go along with that and I liked I'd like to believe that people can be free absolutely and that I know that perfect love casteth out all fear amen and I believe that if people can accept the perfect love of God for us the son Jesus Christ that all that anger can be dealt with absolutely you know you're a very passionate preacher and a very intense person thing with a good sense of humor by the way but but it's hard for me to imagine I mean you're so far removed from the place you described that it's hard for me to even imagine that that was ever you and that's what Jesus can do yes sir that's what a real born-again experience can do separate us absolutely were who we were so would you pray let me have you to speak to that a moment and then pray I learned this one thing that anger is a deep-seated something of you wanting things to change but you can't make them change and that's what anger is really at the core Wow it's that desire to want to change something and you just can't change it powerless to shape our lists to change and and so it's a frustration in that way and so my encouragement to everybody watching is that you know you you have to realize at some point in your life that only God can change things sometimes there are things out of our control but I want to pray and ask the Lord to just right now touch anybody that would be in this place that would be in a condition where their minds and their hearts are absolutely just riddled yes anger and with okay maybe fear or depression and if you're here listening under the sound of our voice today we want you to know that the Lord Jesus loves you yes that it cares for you and that he wants you to be free come on such bondage yes you do also we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus that's a great hand Jesus we'll just stretch out amen go into every place into every heart go down into them little dark alleys of the heart the earth the human control tower of what controls every thought every emotion that seat of passion then that only God can change Lord may your hand stretch deep into those places and bring change yes Lord God because you're the only one that can bring a love can bring a fervor can bring a desire an intense passion to want to serve you and lord I pray that you will just take every individual Lord then would be bound under these type of chains Lord that you'll give them freedom yes that Lord you will free them even right now Lord as they confess as they believe as they open up their heart may the Holy Ghost I pray just go out there and touch every life and we pray these things and ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we commit it to your Lord and every person for we know you are able God yeah you are and a reward er of those that diligently seek you for we committed in Jesus Christ's name a man and a man a man and he made this thank you so much brighter to my front L you this has been wonderful for me we'll have to do it again please let's do it let's do it god bless you thank you so much for joining us today brother bin no rod has blessed us and he has given us truth and tons to think about and you can pray you can continue to walk in the Grace in the victory that the Lord Jesus has purchased for you he has fought this battle and he has won and because he has won you and our winners too and so we just say thank you for taking this time with us and god bless you until till we meet again bye-bye [Music] you [Music]
