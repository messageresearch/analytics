[0:00] I want to encourage your heart and I
[0:03] want you to know that we have received
[0:05] of the Lord an
[0:07] anointing to overcome
[0:10] anything that the enemy puts in our life
[0:14] he has made us not only
[0:17] conquerors but he has made us more than
[0:21] conquerors through Jesus Christ who
[0:24] strengthens us you know the difference
[0:27] in being a conqueror and more than a
[0:29] conqueror to be a conqueror means to
[0:32] fight the battle and win to be more than
[0:35] a conqueror means to let him do the
[0:38] fighting and you share the prize we are
[0:42] Heirs of God and join Heirs of Jesus
[0:46] Christ I want you to know that
[0:48] everything we need to make the Rapture
[0:51] is in Us by the word of the hour it lies
[0:56] in this little bride in seed form what
[0:59] we're waiting reading on is the
[1:00] continuation of the unction of the holy
[1:03] spirit that quickens that seed and
[1:06] causes it to come to manifestation in
[1:08] our lives and when that manifestation
[1:11] begins to come it gives us the anointing
[1:14] it gives us the dunamis the power that
[1:17] we need to overcome the enemy anytime
[1:23] anywhere and on any ground brother
[1:25] brandom said God's giving us that power
[1:29] to overcome the same God that has
[1:32] brought us this far will never leave us
[1:36] he will never forsake us he'll be with
[1:40] us right on to the end if we keep
[1:44] trusting
[1:46] him so if you're waiting to call
[1:48] yourself an overcomer until you beat it
[1:51] in the natural you're missing something
[1:54] first you beat it in the spirit and how
[1:56] do you do it by faith so you overcome
[1:59] come it first by faith that's the
[2:02] spiritual battle and once you've
[2:05] overcome it by faith and mastered it by
[2:07] faith then you watch it come into
[2:10] manifestation in the natural realm
[2:13] that's how powerful faith is Faith
[2:15] causes things to manifest in the
[2:18] physical
[2:19] Dimension spiritual Faith causes things
[2:23] to be created to be manifested in the
[2:26] physical Dimension the New Testament
[2:29] tells us that I I salute the church in
[2:33] Babylon the most evil city in that day
[2:37] and yet there was a group of Believers
[2:40] overcoming Christians who were surviving
[2:43] in Babylon so even in leod deia the
[2:47] worst of the church age there's still a
[2:50] bride church that will prosper in the
[2:53] things of God if you believe that say
[2:56] Amen am so 2024 will continue continue
[3:00] to be a year of
[3:01] overcoming no matter how dark it gets
[3:04] out there no matter how serious it gets
[3:08] and the world is going to it's going to
[3:11] grow
[3:12] darker and they're going to be
[3:14] difficulty this year but the bride
[3:16] doesn't have to worry about whether or
[3:18] not she'll
[3:19] overcome because the Overcomer is in her
[3:23] hello you know the
[3:27] Overcomer you're filled with the over
[3:34] over
