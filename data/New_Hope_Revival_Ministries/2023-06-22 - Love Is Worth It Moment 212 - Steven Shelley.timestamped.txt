[0:06] he beautifies the meek with
[0:09] salvation
[0:11] and the word salvation is Yeshua
[0:15] say it with me Yeshua and that's the
[0:18] Hebrew name of the Lord Jesus Christ so
[0:20] the scriptures really say he would
[0:22] beautify the meek with himself
[0:25] it's Jesus that shines out of your
[0:28] countenance it's Jesus that makes you
[0:31] light it's Jesus that causes you to be
[0:34] bright and the direct results of having
[0:38] received his light is you receive love
[0:41] and you don't only receive love you're
[0:44] not just a taker of love you're a giver
[0:46] of love and by this shall all men know
[0:50] that you are my disciples
[0:52] by this shall all men know that you have
[0:54] passed from Death unto life
[0:58] that you will have love one for another
[1:04] we've got to have it
[1:06] did somebody hear me we've got to have
[1:09] that kind of love it's in US you can't
[1:12] be saved and not have that kind of love
[1:14] Jesus brings it when he moves in
[1:16] but it's the giving
[1:19] you might remember the story of how a
[1:21] friend of ours had an experience with
[1:25] this whole scenario of did you learn to
[1:28] love
[1:30] can you imagine standing waiting to be
[1:33] escorted into the presence of God in
[1:35] eternity and having the question asked
[1:38] not did you dress right
[1:40] [Music]
[1:42] not did you believe right
[1:44] not did you go to the right church but
[1:47] can you imagine being asked did you
[1:49] learn to love
[1:51] someone answered and said Lord I loved
[1:53] you
[1:58] but I never learned to love your people
[2:02] now how many of you know there's
[2:04] something wrong
[2:06] I happen to believe that that experience
[2:08] was real and I happen to believe that it
[2:11] stands as a stark reminder to us today
[2:15] that we can get all the doctrines right
[2:20] we can know exactly where to send
[2:22] somebody in the tape
[2:24] but until we can learn to love an
[2:27] unconditional love a love that's not
[2:30] based on someone's treatment toward you
[2:33] the Bible doesn't teach us to treat
[2:35] others as as they deserve to be treated
[2:39] or love others only if they deserve to
[2:42] be loved
[2:43] but it tells us that we should do unto
[2:46] others as we would have them to do unto
[2:48] us not as they do
[2:51] so we're doing right and we're doing
[2:54] good and we're expressing love even if
[2:57] it hurts
[2:59] how many of you know Love Hurts
[3:01] love is costly
[3:03] in all kinds of relationships in
[3:06] Parental relationship and love a spousal
[3:10] and and courtship and it's painful love
[3:14] is painful but let me tell you don't let
[3:17] the enemy talk you out of the concept
[3:19] it's worth it it's worth it the gift to
[3:23] be able to love someone the gift to be
[3:25] able to receive love from someone is
[3:28] priceless
[3:29] and nobody should be loving like the
[3:32] Bride of Jesus Christ we should have the
[3:35] greatest measure of love one toward the
[3:37] other
