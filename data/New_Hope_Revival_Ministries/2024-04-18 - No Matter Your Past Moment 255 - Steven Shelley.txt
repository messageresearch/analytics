TRANSCRIPT
========================================
God has chosen to forget a whole lot of things he knew about youo Hallelujah Redemption is more than just forgiveness of sin Redemption is to be taken back to the original thoughts of God concerning your life so no matter what you've done or how long you have spent spinning your wheel [Music] no matter how long you spent on the gerbal wheel of performance trying to earn your salvation God looks over all of that he said you didn't need to waste those days but I'm a redeemer of time so as soon as you come to the revelation of who I am you'll also have a revelation of who you are because of who I am come on and I will redeem the years we're blessed people yes we are the word has set us free yes sir so he says to us I am joined to you like a [Music] wall so when it feels like the walls are closing in on us he is experiencing the same thing that we are experiencing somebody said I need that in the New Testament I'm glad you do the New Testament says he is touched with the feelings yes sir of our infirmities so when you hit a roadblock he does too yes sir that doesn't mean he can't move Beyond he's the only one that can but it means he feels your roadblock when you get stuck in the mud he feels you're stuck come on when you get weary and discouraged he feels your weariness yes sir he feels your discouragement the good thing is he's not a job's comforter he didn't just come to tell you why you got to where you are he came to do something about it aren't you glad you serve a god who's able to do something about it he's touched with the feeling of our infirmities all through the word we see God joining himself to the struggles of his servants even his disobedient Servants of which there must be some among us because if there's ever been a time in your life that you have not obeyed the Lord Lord you've been a disobedient servant and you can wallow around in your sorrow and in your and your discouragement and your condemnation or you can choose like a captive Daughter of Zion get up awake awake put on your strength o Zion Shake yourself from the dust so God is always joining himself to the struggles of even his disobedient servants it's the one it's one of the most comforting and encouraging pictures that we have of the care that God has for his children and we have it all the way through the Bible are you with me this is a message to tell you that God joined himself to you in your heartache in your sorrow in your pain in your loss in your mistake sir he joined himself to you in your backsliding in your lukewarm this sir when you grew cold he was still joined to you when you cared about him and when you didn't care about him he was still joined to you and he's got an appointment He's got an appointment for you at the house of God he's got an appointment for you at badeel he wants you to get down to the house of God remember you're the house he just wants you to acknowledge that you're his house and he wants you to corporately meet with Believers you'll never This Modern church will never ever ever ever convince me that being in church somewhere is not important
