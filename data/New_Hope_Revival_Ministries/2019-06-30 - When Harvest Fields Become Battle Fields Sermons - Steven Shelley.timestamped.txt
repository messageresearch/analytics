[0:00] I love the King James version of the
[0:19] Bible I
[0:21] I like the King's English it gives me
[0:24] something to to murder so I love it and
[0:28] I don't ever want anybody to think I
[0:30] don't and we received old last year
[0:33] sometime a few criticisms from precious
[0:36] message people because we dared quote
[0:40] from any other version than the King
[0:42] James but I don't think that that's sin
[0:47] I think if we're very careful and we
[0:50] keep lining it up with the King James
[0:52] and lining it up with the original I
[0:54] think we'll be all right is that okay
[0:56] so I'm gonna read my text this morning
[0:58] and I don't normally do that but I'm
[1:01] going to read a portion of my text just
[1:03] from the amplified version and I think
[1:07] I'm safe to do that because I feel like
[1:09] you are very familiar with this portion
[1:13] of Scripture in the King James but if
[1:16] not you can check me out and I think
[1:18] you'll find that this is a beautiful
[1:21] amplified expanded version of this text
[1:24] it's found in Hebrews chapter 10 verses
[1:28] 35 and 36 I'm going to tell you upfront
[1:31] that I've spent a lot of time in this
[1:34] message it's a very simple message but
[1:36] I've spent a lot of time with it because
[1:39] it came by inspiration a few weeks ago
[1:42] and I worked really hard this week to to
[1:47] boil it down you know it's very hard to
[1:51] mark through things and say I won't
[1:53] share that now I won't share that now
[1:55] it's hard you know you
[1:56] if you've ever prepared a sermon or a
[1:59] less-than you know what that's about I
[2:01] as a pastor in the summertime when so
[2:05] many people are gone and a lot of times
[2:07] at one time you have this tendency to
[2:10] say I'd better hold on to that for when
[2:12] everybody
[2:13] here because everybody needs to hear it
[2:15] I'll just preface what I'm going to say
[2:18] today by saying everybody in this
[2:21] ministry needs to hear this message I
[2:23] believe that I'm not just saying it I
[2:25] believe it with all my heart and may God
[2:29] grant them a hunger and a desire to
[2:30] catch it later and I need your help to
[2:35] get it out to make it what it needs to
[2:36] be this morning Hebrews chapter 10 verse
[2:40] 35 and 36 in the amplified bible do not
[2:44] therefore fling away your fearless
[2:49] confidence now how many of you already
[2:51] remember that in king james casting not
[2:54] away your confidence do not therefore
[2:56] fling away your fearless confidence for
[3:00] it carries a great and glorious
[3:04] compensation of reward how many of your
[3:07] resting on that for you have need of
[3:12] steadfast patience and endurance the
[3:18] King James is one of the only versions
[3:20] of the Bible that translates this word
[3:22] patience most all of the other versions
[3:26] use the word endurance they're very
[3:29] similar but not necessarily 100%
[3:31] identical so I like it that the
[3:35] amplified uses both for you have need of
[3:39] steadfast patience and endurance so that
[3:45] you may perform and fully accomplish the
[3:50] will of God do you believe that your
[3:53] purpose here I believe it's our purpose
[3:56] here to perform and fully accomplish the
[4:01] will of God and thus receive oh my
[4:07] listen at this and thus receive and
[4:12] carry away and enjoy to the fool what is
[4:19] promised let me read it again and thus
[4:23] receive
[4:24] and carry away and enjoy to the fool
[4:28] what is promised you don't want to
[4:33] receive it and then drop it you want to
[4:36] receive it and carry it with you how
[4:39] many of you believe that every time we
[4:40] come into the presence of the word we
[4:43] have something to carry away we do a man
[4:47] we receive another level or another
[4:51] layer or another expression of our
[4:54] origin of where we came from we came
[4:56] from the word and from the presence of
[5:00] the Lord the presence of the word so
[5:02] let's pray father we thank you this
[5:05] morning that you are with us we feel you
[5:08] and even if we didn't feel you we would
[5:11] reach out to try to touch you anyway
[5:13] because we know that you are the source
[5:17] of everything that we need today if
[5:20] we're in need of pain relief you're the
[5:24] great pain reliever if we need healing
[5:27] from infirmity or disease you're the
[5:29] great healer several people mention
[5:32] wisdom direction and understanding and
[5:35] even Nathan prayed a voice behind us
[5:38] Lord there are many of us who could use
[5:40] that not just to face a serious moment
[5:44] but but every day we could use the
[5:47] direction of the Lord and help from the
[5:49] Lord in our life and so we ask that you
[5:52] would provide that that we would hear
[5:55] you not just this morning as the word is
[5:58] expounded but as we take the word home
[6:01] with us may he continue to speak and may
[6:05] we continue to hear we bind every
[6:08] demonic power every demon of hell that
[6:12] opposes the release of God's perfect and
[6:16] true word and we ask this morning that a
[6:19] heaven that the heavens would be opened
[6:22] over this place and that you would
[6:24] channel to us that you would pour upon
[6:27] us everything we need for strength for
[6:31] sustenance for this week ahead now I
[6:34] know some
[6:36] my agenda my plans for the week my
[6:39] calendar but Lord there are many things
[6:42] that all of us will face this week that
[6:44] we've not penciled in and we're going to
[6:47] need your help to get through those
[6:49] things to make the right decision in
[6:52] those things and to come out smelling
[6:54] like you in those things we asked for
[6:58] that grace this morning it is in the
[7:00] lovely an exalted name of Yeshua our
[7:03] Messiah we pray amen and the church said
[7:07] Amen you may be seated don't forget to
[7:10] help me I want to preach this morning I
[7:15] have about 10 titles
[7:20] none of them are necessary but I'm
[7:27] starting I'm starting to title them so
[7:30] that when I leave them somebody will
[7:32] know what they are I'm taking a little
[7:35] time to do that and and so I guess my
[7:39] favorite title is when harvest fields
[7:43] become battle fields I believe you'll be
[7:47] able to relate to that this morning you
[7:50] might also call it fight or flight
[7:53] you might also call it guarding your
[7:56] harvest but here's what I'd like for you
[7:59] to remember listen carefully you're
[8:03] gonna want to write this down if you
[8:05] don't fight for your beans but devil
[8:08] will take your taco your burrito and
[8:11] your whole enchilada
[8:18] point 1 write it down what you hear in
[8:22] church this morning I heard about tacos
[8:23] and burritos and enchiladas if you don't
[8:27] fight for your beans the devil will take
[8:30] your taco your burrito and your whole
[8:33] enchilada
[8:34] and your Mexican casserole to sister or
[8:37] leader if we don't fight for what we
[8:40] have for what God has given us the devil
[8:43] will take it and he will never give it
[8:46] back until somebody
[8:48] dares to face him nose to nose and say
[8:52] devil give it back in the name of the
[8:55] Lord Jesus Christ now how many of you
[8:58] believe he has to obey because we expose
[9:02] him I want you to know that devil is
[9:05] exposed today and we are uncovering him
[9:10] today and we are saying according to
[9:13] God's Word
[9:14] proverbs 631 concerning a thief and we
[9:19] know who the thief is the Bible said the
[9:23] thief cometh not but for to steal and to
[9:26] kill and to destroy every person here
[9:30] has an enemy and it's not so much that
[9:33] you are his enemy but the Word of God
[9:35] that is in you is his enemy he is the
[9:39] enemy of God therefore he is an enemy of
[9:43] God's Word and the Word of God that is
[9:46] in you must come to fruition it has to
[9:51] come to maturity and expression and
[9:53] Satan opposes that so he steals it one
[9:58] beam at a time until there's no burrito
[10:01] left he doesn't just come in and snatch
[10:05] the whole thing all at one time because
[10:08] you would catch him and he knows that if
[10:11] you catch him he's really in trouble
[10:13] well I want to tell you today we're
[10:16] exposing him and we're catching him in
[10:19] the act and we're demanding according to
[10:22] proverbs 631 but if he be found he shall
[10:28] restore Sevenfold he shall give all the
[10:33] substance of his house every bit of it
[10:36] and so I want my burrito back I want my
[10:39] enchilada back I want my taco back I
[10:42] want every one of my beans back if you
[10:45] feel the same way say man it's like this
[10:48] if you don't fight for your beans he'll
[10:50] take your beans and come for your corn
[10:52] and if you don't fight for your corn
[10:55] he'll come and get your okra and then
[10:58] he'll come for your Tomatoes and that's
[11:00] where we're really gonna have a fight
[11:02] he's not getting them Satan doesn't want
[11:06] you to have any part of the harvest that
[11:09] you have sowed toward well we say to the
[11:13] devil you're a liar you're a thief and
[11:17] you are exposed and you must take your
[11:20] hands off of what God has claimed as his
[11:25] own I want to tell you I want to share a
[11:28] few things with you about harvest this
[11:31] morning and I need to do that quickly so
[11:34] that I can get to where I really want to
[11:36] be here's a few things for you and I to
[11:38] remember about harvest the quality and
[11:42] quantity of your harvest is directly
[11:46] proportional to how you sow your seed
[11:50] and how you sow your seed determines
[11:55] your harvest the quality and quantity
[11:59] you can't so bad seed and get a good
[12:02] harvest right you got a sow good seed
[12:06] now I want to make sure you understand
[12:09] that we are talking about finances but
[12:13] we're not just talking about finances in
[12:17] fact finances is only a small portion of
[12:20] what we're talking about but I know that
[12:22] as soon as we talk about seed time and
[12:25] harvest your mind is going to go to the
[12:28] bank account but I want you to know my
[12:30] money is not all I so I so my money I
[12:35] can't hardly wait to get it so that I
[12:38] can turn loose of it I mean that I'm
[12:40] blessed when God blesses me I
[12:44] automatically look for ways that I can
[12:46] give it back most of the time that is
[12:50] through the church but it's not always
[12:52] through the church I'm thankful to have
[12:54] it so that I can give it and if God will
[12:57] bless me with more I want to give that
[12:59] away too because what I have found out
[13:01] is my granny was right when she used to
[13:05] say you cannot outgive the Lord but your
[13:09] money is not your only seed we sow our
[13:12] time we saw our debt
[13:15] ocation we saw our loyalty we saw our
[13:18] faithfulness we solu
[13:20] we saw so many seed and the quality
[13:24] quality the quality of your seed
[13:28] determines the quality of your harvest
[13:31] you can't you know I have had seed that
[13:37] got pushed back and didn't get planted
[13:39] for years and I'm always blessed when I
[13:43] get a good turnout but I know that I'm
[13:46] never getting the turnout I'm never
[13:49] getting the the the harvest that I would
[13:53] have received had I planted the seed
[13:56] when it was fresh
[13:57] the older the seed gets the less harvest
[14:01] you can expect there's still life in
[14:04] there as you heard brother random talk
[14:06] about seed that were was as old as the
[14:10] gardeners of Egypt during the time of
[14:12] Joseph it brings forth a harvest but it
[14:16] doesn't bring forth the same kind of
[14:18] harvest or the same quality or quantity
[14:20] of harvest that it would bring forth if
[14:23] it was planted in the right season
[14:25] before it gets so old have you ever
[14:27] opened a path say flower seed that were
[14:30] old and not only do you see see but you
[14:33] see dust in there because some of the
[14:35] seed of rotted some of them have dried
[14:37] up and they have become powder so the
[14:40] quality of your seed and the quantity
[14:44] how many seeds you plant is directly
[14:48] proportional to what kind of harvest you
[14:51] can expect I have never said that ever
[14:54] without feeling a little measure of
[14:58] resistance in the house no matter where
[15:00] I have said it and that is simply
[15:03] because again people's mind always
[15:05] always goes to money when you're talking
[15:09] about seed time and harvest but I didn't
[15:12] make that up I didn't add that to my
[15:16] notes till this morning but I didn't
[15:17] make that up
[15:18] because here's what the scripture said
[15:20] very very carefully 2nd Corinthians 9
[15:24] and verse 6 stay with me but
[15:28] this I say he which soweth sparingly
[15:34] meagerly
[15:35] shall reap also sparingly so some of us
[15:41] can look forward to a sparse harvest
[15:45] because we are far too stingy with the
[15:49] seed that we are sowing remember we're
[15:52] not just talking about money come on now
[15:53] help me we're not just talking about
[15:56] money we're talking about that which you
[15:59] have that which you carry that is a
[16:02] value that's seed what God has given you
[16:06] what God has placed in you gift or
[16:08] talent or ability that's also seed for
[16:12] you to sow amen are you with me
[16:17] you are with me a minute ago when I'm
[16:19] talking about taking it back
[16:21] but now when we're talking about making
[16:24] sure that you're sowing properly for
[16:26] harvest people get a little you can just
[16:30] feel it but the scripture was clear if
[16:32] you sow sparingly reluctantly I don't
[16:38] ever forget the little widow because to
[16:41] you her offering of her giving her
[16:44] sowing would have been very sparse or
[16:46] sparingly but to her it was very
[16:49] bountiful because it was all she had so
[16:53] you're never to compare your seed or
[16:56] your sowing to someone else's sowing not
[17:00] of their life not of their time because
[17:02] you may be called to invest lots of time
[17:05] in someone and someone next to you may
[17:08] not have the same calling so if you
[17:10] don't see them doing what you do that
[17:12] doesn't mean you can judge them it means
[17:14] that everybody must sow based on what
[17:18] God has placed in their life that has
[17:21] value whether again that's money or
[17:23] talent or time or or gifting or whatever
[17:26] it is and we'll give you a minute to say
[17:28] man and he which soweth bountifully
[17:34] shall also reap also excuse me
[17:39] he would sow about ibly
[17:42] reap also bountifully so the quantity
[17:46] and quality the quality and the quantity
[17:48] of your harvest is directly
[17:51] proportionate to your sowing to the seed
[17:55] that you sow this is a very important
[17:58] scripture to write down and remember in
[18:00] this Luke chapter six and verse 38 and
[18:03] we just read this a week ago give give
[18:08] give give of all that you have that is a
[18:13] value if it's valuable and God has
[18:19] placed it in your hands give give and it
[18:23] shall be given unto you good measure
[18:26] pressed down and shaken together and
[18:31] running over remember god shakes the bag
[18:35] down so that more can be placed in there
[18:39] when it's time to dump that on your head
[18:41] every one of us have done that my granny
[18:44] used to talk to me about picking cotton
[18:46] she hated picking cotton most of the
[18:50] time the cotton came in the end of
[18:52] August or the 1st of September in down
[18:55] home where she was from
[18:57] but always every year on her birthday
[19:00] August the 8th there was enough cotton
[19:03] to be ready that her mother would say
[19:06] Mildred go and get the early cotton and
[19:10] she'd say mama can I do it tomorrow
[19:13] today is my birthday and her mama would
[19:16] say what a wonderful day for you to go
[19:19] pick the early cotton and she said I
[19:21] hated to but I learned that if I would
[19:25] just put it in and she said sometime I'd
[19:28] even put it in my hand and roll it
[19:30] around that I could fill up the bag
[19:32] really fast and I would take it to mama
[19:35] and mama would stand on the porch and
[19:37] shake it down and say go fill it up
[19:40] again and she said I would find out that
[19:44] I could put twice more not just a half
[19:46] more but twice more than what I had put
[19:49] in in that bag if I just shook it down
[19:52] that gives me a hope this morning
[19:54] give and it shall be given unto you good
[19:58] measure press down and then shaken
[20:01] together and running over shall men
[20:06] shall men that's how God works he uses
[20:09] others shall men give into your bosom
[20:13] for with the same measure here it is
[20:16] proportionate somebody say proportionate
[20:18] with the same measure that you meet with
[20:22] all it shall be measured to you again
[20:26] now remember that is based it's relevant
[20:30] and it's based on what God has given you
[20:33] that's a value maybe you are talented in
[20:37] certain areas and not talented in others
[20:39] and people keep trying to pull you into
[20:41] an area that you don't have a lot of
[20:44] value in well you're gonna be sowing
[20:46] sparingly in an area that you don't do
[20:48] very well in but slip back over here to
[20:51] something that God has placed in you and
[20:53] use that so that and there's much of
[20:59] that as you possibly can the truth is a
[21:02] lot of us in this room we don't really
[21:04] feel like we're good at anything well I
[21:06] want you to know that's a lie I don't
[21:08] care who you are or how insignificant
[21:11] you feel God is not a liar and he has
[21:14] placed something precious something holy
[21:17] something valuable in you not just his
[21:20] spirit but he has placed his potential
[21:23] he has placed a portion of his ability
[21:28] that's what a talent is that's what a
[21:31] gift is it's God giving you a part of
[21:34] himself that you can learn to use to sow
[21:38] to give and bless other people because
[21:42] we're living to bless the Lord and we're
[21:45] living to bless other people if you're
[21:47] with me you can say Amen not an offering
[21:50] message you would be delighted to know
[21:53] that every bill that we owe is paid
[21:57] God is good this isn't an offering
[22:00] message Church payment made Jerusalem
[22:03] payment made and we've got some debt but
[22:07] we're making
[22:07] payments on that where did we get that
[22:09] we got that from the times that we
[22:11] didn't have what we needed to pay but
[22:14] we're making payments on that but as of
[22:16] today we don't know anything other than
[22:20] you know regular payments Church
[22:22] payments etc but nothing is late nothing
[22:25] is past due and nothing will be due in
[22:28] fact a lot of what is due tomorrow it's
[22:30] been paid so I'm not preaching about
[22:34] money you can relax but I will tell you
[22:39] this if some of us could get a hold of
[22:41] this and apply it to our finances we
[22:46] would never have to take a special
[22:48] effort again you can't outgive the Lord
[22:54] now I got to I got to go on and here's
[22:58] how this stuff works we so we wait and
[23:02] we hope to reap we sow we wait
[23:07] eventually we reap you can't believe
[23:10] what it says on the seed pack it's not
[23:16] always accurate when they print that
[23:19] seed pack they print it for all zones
[23:23] you put that out I mean there may be a
[23:25] little God on there but it'll tell you a
[23:27] germination period and I want you to
[23:30] know you don't always happen just like
[23:32] that the girl who cuts my hair told me a
[23:36] month ago she was about to get a harvest
[23:38] and she never did get it never did get
[23:40] it never did get it it just it come on
[23:42] but it wasn't getting big enough it
[23:44] wasn't growing and and Friday night we
[23:47] were out and about and she sent me a
[23:49] text and showed me a picture of three
[23:51] cucumbers in a little old tomato and she
[23:53] said I'm officially a gardener
[23:56] she felt that harvest was going to come
[23:58] a month ago but but because she saw it
[24:01] beginning to form and beginning to grow
[24:04] she had no no grid she had never planted
[24:06] before that she killed every plant
[24:08] anybody'd ever given her she said so she
[24:11] had no grid for how long it would take
[24:13] that little old cucumber to get now in
[24:16] the right season with all the right
[24:17] conditions they grow overnight but in
[24:20] one
[24:21] stuff some wasn't going on just right
[24:23] she's getting in the swing of it she's
[24:26] killing her bugs she was one of them
[24:28] that had a trouble had trouble killing
[24:30] the past I said okay let him know thrive
[24:33] because they're not gonna thrive on the
[24:35] weeds they're gonna thrive on your work
[24:40] they are out to eat what you have
[24:44] planted before it comes to harvest and
[24:48] if you let the devil he will come after
[24:52] the fruit fruit is mature and he'll try
[24:55] to steal it then he never stops trying
[24:58] to steal the harvest of what you have
[25:02] sown for in the work of the kingdom of
[25:04] God he's never going to lay down and
[25:07] play dead he's never going to let you a
[25:10] prospering Arvest without a fight you're
[25:15] gonna have to fight and you're gonna
[25:17] have to hold on tight and you're gonna
[25:20] have to say you ain't getting my burrito
[25:23] because I'm not going to let you get my
[25:25] beans you with me some of us have sowed
[25:30] and prayed and waited and sowed and
[25:33] prayed and waited and sowed and prayed
[25:37] and waited and nothing comes in fact a
[25:41] lot of us feel like that we are very
[25:43] overdue for a harvest sometimes we get
[25:48] mighty tired of waiting but here is
[25:50] something very important to remember I
[25:52] don't know how long you're going to have
[25:55] to wait but I know that God doesn't lie
[25:58] help me just a minute I know that God
[26:01] doesn't lie he is not a liar neither the
[26:04] son of man that he would have need to
[26:06] repent if God promised it it will come
[26:09] to pass it's the promise of his word
[26:12] you're not taking me at my word you're
[26:15] taking God at His Word if he said it
[26:18] that settles it if you want it to work
[26:21] in your life you've got to believe it
[26:23] and attach faith to it but as soon as it
[26:26] came
[26:27] out of his mind and out of his mouth it
[26:29] was forever settled heaven and earth can
[26:33] pass away but he said my word remaineth
[26:36] abideth continuous forever and ever and
[26:41] ever so you've gotta wait some time and
[26:44] here is something to remember you must
[26:47] never abandon your seed you cannot run
[26:53] off and leave it to grow on its own you
[26:59] cannot depend on someone who loves you
[27:02] to take care of your seed it's yours it
[27:09] is very very very personal very personal
[27:17] I'm not going there completely but there
[27:20] is a scripture in the Bible that talks
[27:23] about the wasting of a man's seed do you
[27:29] know what I'm talking about very
[27:31] specific scripture about the wasting of
[27:34] a man's seed because your seed is very
[27:37] personal and it is very precious and
[27:41] your life is in that seed if you don't
[27:48] believe that you ask some of those
[27:49] criminals that they're locking up
[27:52] because they left some of their life
[27:56] they left some of their life behind and
[28:00] somebody went in with a DNA a sample and
[28:04] took that and tested it and sent it off
[28:08] did you know that crimes are being
[28:11] solved today that are 25 and 30 years
[28:16] old because the DNA that the technology
[28:20] needed and and the staff needed to do
[28:24] all the testing was not available and
[28:25] now it's more readily available and in
[28:28] the same manner people are getting off
[28:31] people are walking out of the jail that
[28:34] had been in there 25 and 30 years
[28:36] because of a mistake
[28:40] and I always grieve at that when I hear
[28:43] that it grieves me I had some time that
[28:47] I wanted to listen to something a little
[28:48] less heavy and I thought I was choosing
[28:51] the right thing I listened to to a man
[28:54] here from Alabama a black man from
[28:56] Alabama that served many many years I
[28:59] listened to his book on on my phone on
[29:01] audio of all those years that he served
[29:04] in death row and nobody heard him and
[29:07] nobody would listen to him and nobody
[29:09] would help him until finally a man over
[29:12] here in Montgomery who has dedicated his
[29:14] life to helping people like that was
[29:16] able to go back and prove there's no
[29:18] possible way what I liked about this man
[29:22] he's hurt he's wounded his life is
[29:25] forever changed but instead of being
[29:27] bitter he said I've got to turn this
[29:31] around and make what I have left of my
[29:33] life free to work it's gotta count for
[29:36] something it's got a man out for
[29:38] something
[29:39] my mother died didn't when I was in
[29:42] prison I think my best friend died when
[29:45] I was no not his best friend but a
[29:47] member of his best friend's family maybe
[29:49] a wife or child died while I was in
[29:51] prison I'll never be able to get that
[29:53] time back with them but I can take what
[29:56] time I have and make it count how are
[30:00] they able to do that sometime because
[30:02] there is you there is you in your seed
[30:08] you are represented in the seed that you
[30:11] sow and I'm not just talking about the
[30:16] male seed of sperm either I'm talking
[30:18] about your gift your talent your time
[30:22] your finance you are represented in that
[30:27] seed so don't you get tired of waiting
[30:30] and walk off and holler to somebody else
[30:33] tend my garden
[30:35] it's your seed you are represented in
[30:39] that seed that you sowed and you've got
[30:42] to stay there and watch that seed my
[30:46] momma momma don't depend on the preacher
[30:50] to guard your seed don't depend on
[30:53] your wife to watch over your seed or
[30:56] your neighbor to care for you've got to
[30:58] see the life the value and the
[31:02] investment that you made whether it is
[31:04] in the natural or in the spiritual and
[31:06] you've got to stand on guard to tell the
[31:11] devil you're not getting my beans
[31:15] because I'm gonna make me a burrito in
[31:19] the by-and-by I'm not the biggest
[31:24] Mexican fan in this room but I found
[31:27] that quote this week and I said and I'm
[31:30] gonna build around that because I know
[31:32] there's a lot of taco eaters in the
[31:37] church I don't know if you put beans in
[31:39] your taco but pretend like you do the
[31:42] enemy wants to steal if he can keep you
[31:46] from sowing seed he will if he can't
[31:50] keep you from sowing seed he'll come how
[31:53] many of you know he'll send birds of the
[31:54] air I'm gonna follow through this thing
[32:01] I've been sighs spent a lot of time I'm
[32:03] gonna I'm gonna put some investment here
[32:05] can't you hear him sometime ha ha ha I
[32:13] wished I could sound like a pigeon hmm
[32:17] but I can't get anybody that's pretty
[32:22] good that's not how they sound when they
[32:25] get shot but that's how they sound when
[32:27] they're thriving
[32:30] caw caw caw it's like lies
[32:36] it's like Satan's threats it's like the
[32:40] enemy's accusation always making noise
[32:44] caw caw caw trying to distract you and
[32:49] if you walk out of that field to get
[32:51] your rifle you better be careful because
[32:54] they're coming down for a harvest
[32:56] they're coming down to eat the seed the
[32:59] birds of the air will come and eat your
[33:01] seed if it's already sprouted and they
[33:04] can't eat it well you know what the
[33:06] enemy will do
[33:06] he'll send a cankerworm he'll send a
[33:08] palmer worm he'll send a counter pillar
[33:10] he'll send one of those beautiful
[33:12] beautiful green worms that ginger Bell
[33:14] found over there on Olivia's tomato
[33:16] plant hideous hideous somebody said
[33:22] they've got to have a purpose they do to
[33:25] teach you about how to guard your
[33:28] harvest overnight he'll strip every leaf
[33:32] off overnight he'll chew on this stem he
[33:37] will get the bloom there will be nothing
[33:39] left I want you to know I've seen them
[33:42] you they call out to their cousins and
[33:46] the next thing you know they'll eat it
[33:48] down to a little stem about like fat if
[33:50] you're not out there you got to get in
[33:53] there and grab it and smoosh it because
[33:56] the enemy is out to devour what you have
[34:01] sown in faith believing that God is
[34:05] going to give you a harvest over and I
[34:07] could really preach on that I could stay
[34:09] on that a while but I in Galatians
[34:12] chapter 6 verse 9 in King James and let
[34:16] us not be weary in well-doing
[34:18] for in due season we shall reap if we
[34:24] don't listen to the crows if we don't
[34:27] run away and leave the seed we planted
[34:29] that do something else because we're
[34:32] distracted if we faint not if we don't
[34:35] get too tired and too weary and throw up
[34:38] our hands and give up if we will hold on
[34:41] to this promise there is a due season
[34:44] every seed right this put this down
[34:47] every seed has a due season for maturity
[34:52] for harvest every one you plant in the
[34:55] natural in the spiritual there's a
[34:57] gestation period there and it will come
[35:00] to its maturity to its fruition in the
[35:04] right time let me read this in another
[35:06] version so let's not get tired of doing
[35:09] what is good it is good to sow seed if
[35:13] God gives you something he gave it to
[35:16] you to bless
[35:17] you and he gave it to you to give to
[35:19] somebody else to bless them so let's not
[35:23] get tired of doing what is good at just
[35:26] the right time my timing is quite
[35:33] obviously not his timing I'm trying to
[35:36] work on that because I would like to
[35:38] allow my timing to line up with the
[35:42] timing of the Lord because that would do
[35:44] away with some of that Hope deferred and
[35:46] disappointment that comes by expecting
[35:50] God to move when we want him to move or
[35:53] when we think we need him to move when
[35:55] he's already got a plan come on now his
[35:59] plan is older than your expectation his
[36:03] plan to prosper you and your seed was
[36:06] from before the beginning of time and if
[36:09] you just hold on and not grow weary if
[36:11] you just hold on and not give up and not
[36:14] not not walk away from what you were
[36:17] planted and not faint the amplified
[36:20] bible says if this way well let me let
[36:21] me yeah just the right time we will reap
[36:23] a harvest a blessing if we don't give up
[36:25] the amplified said and let us not lose
[36:27] heart and grow weary and faint in acting
[36:31] nobly and doing right for in due time
[36:34] and at the read it for me at the
[36:41] appointed season we shall reap if we do
[36:45] not loosen who and relax our courage and
[36:50] feint it takes courage to plant a seed
[36:55] fear will keep you from even planting a
[36:58] seed it takes courage you've got to
[37:00] overcome fear to even put your seed in
[37:03] the ground because you know what can
[37:05] happen to it once you turn it loose the
[37:11] enemy will make you think you've got to
[37:13] hold on to it because one in the hand is
[37:16] better than two in the bush the enemy
[37:19] will make you think that you've got to
[37:21] hold on to it so that it's not exploited
[37:23] or so that it's not wasted but God is
[37:26] calling you to put it somewhere
[37:28] and believe him he-man we're talking
[37:35] about all across the board now don't go
[37:36] back don't only go back don't only go
[37:40] back to the checkbook but don't forget
[37:42] the checkbook don't you dare do it don't
[37:47] ever do that
[37:48] don't ever rule that out don't ever let
[37:50] the enemy intimidate you in that manner
[37:53] because if you do you will limit your
[37:56] harvest it will absolutely be limited
[38:00] all right let us not grow weary and
[38:02] faint and acting nobly and doing right
[38:04] for in due time and at the appointed
[38:06] season we shall reap if we do not loosen
[38:09] and relax our courage and feint the
[38:11] timing of your harvest is often
[38:14] determined by what you do while you're
[38:18] waiting on it to come in the timing of
[38:24] your harvest is often determined by what
[38:27] you do while you're waiting for it to
[38:30] come in
[38:31] you can't party you can't run off and
[38:35] abandon it you can't despise it you
[38:40] can't get greedy over what you've
[38:42] already turned loose of come on now you
[38:45] can't didn't I'm going there I didn't
[38:48] mean to stay there I don't want to go
[38:50] there but I'm going there for just a
[38:51] minute you can't get mad at the church
[38:53] and then say I want my time back people
[39:00] have done it you know what I told him
[39:02] long gone long gone unless you gave some
[39:09] last week it ain't around any longer you
[39:13] can't get it back we don't offer a
[39:15] money-back guarantee the enemy will
[39:18] drive you crazy about the seeds you've
[39:21] sown if you let him whatever seed
[39:25] natural seed spiritual seed he'll run
[39:27] you crazy and if you start despising
[39:30] that not only did the Bible say give and
[39:33] it shall be given unto you the Bible
[39:35] said God loves a giver who gives with a
[39:39] cheerful heart it's
[39:42] always easy to be cheerful when you're
[39:45] giving away all your time because we
[39:48] like our time it's not always easy to be
[39:52] cheerful when you're giving away your
[39:53] talent or you're giving away your
[39:56] profits it's hard to do sometime amen
[40:03] brother
[40:03] but we have to do it anyway and we have
[40:07] to remember we're always sewing we have
[40:11] to maintain a cheerful spirit it's not
[40:14] Oh Lord Mersey did I just say that did
[40:18] you know that is the opposite of grumpy
[40:27] you can't be cheerful and grumpy at the
[40:31] same time at the same minute to save
[40:34] your life so you can't we're back we're
[40:40] in the checkbook sorry you can't give an
[40:43] offering this morning and have a flat
[40:45] tire tomorrow and curse your seed have
[40:53] you ever done it I have oh if I'd have
[40:59] just waited another week then I would
[41:03] have had the money I need for that tyre
[41:05] let me tell you something that is not
[41:08] the way it works you put your seed your
[41:11] money your gift your time your talent
[41:14] whatever else you carry that's valuable
[41:16] your ear some people have an ear to
[41:20] listen
[41:20] that's something I'm asking God for I've
[41:24] heard enough in my lifetime already to
[41:27] do me with a lot of folks I'll be honest
[41:32] but I'm asking him because I know how
[41:35] important it is for some people to be
[41:38] heard so you may be like me and you may
[41:41] have to ask the Lord to give you an ear
[41:43] that is willing to hear and that's a
[41:45] gift and for some like me it's a
[41:48] sacrifice but I got to do it and I've
[41:52] got to do it as a seed and I've got a
[41:54] it in a cheerful way so that I don't
[41:58] curse my seed by the attitude that I
[42:01] develop because of something that
[42:03] happens along the way because I don't
[42:06] know how long it's going to take that
[42:07] seed to come to maturity and give me a
[42:09] reward I'm gonna have to keep a cheerful
[42:12] spirit about that for a long time maybe
[42:17] you may be anxious to get out of here
[42:20] but the Lord wants you to hear this he
[42:25] wouldn't have given me I'm telling you
[42:26] he would not let me get away from this
[42:29] and even all day yesterday when I said
[42:33] but Lord there's so many who are gone
[42:36] that need to hear this and the Lord
[42:42] reminded me about you and I almost put
[42:46] on face book if you're not out of town
[42:48] please come to church I've got something
[42:52] that I feel like the Lord wants to say
[42:55] to you and you say well I haven't heard
[42:58] him yet keep listening you may get an
[43:02] ear to hear before we leave here in a
[43:03] little while the timing of your harvest
[43:07] is often determined about what you do
[43:09] while you're waiting for it so keep the
[43:10] right spirit how many of you have ever
[43:15] had to say Lord I gave that unto you I
[43:17] gave that unto you I didn't give that to
[43:20] them I gave that unto you I'm not
[43:23] looking to them to give me my harvest
[43:26] I'm looking to you when I gave that my
[43:31] seed might have been used my seed might
[43:34] have been abused my seed might have been
[43:37] stolen away but when I gave my seed I
[43:41] was giving it to you come on it's
[43:45] Kingdom business I invested it with a
[43:48] cheerful heart and I know that you knew
[43:52] that and know that and I'm waiting on my
[43:55] harvest how many of you believe you've
[43:58] still got a harvest coming you can't
[44:02] many of some of you can't accept it
[44:04] because you don't want God in your money
[44:07] see how quiet it'll get you don't want
[44:11] God in your money you want to do what
[44:15] you want to do and what you feel like
[44:16] you should do or can't do or can do and
[44:19] you don't want God to get involved but I
[44:21] want you to know sometimes God will get
[44:23] involved and stretch you I know you a
[44:25] lot of you a lot of you people know that
[44:27] he will stretch you beyond your mental
[44:32] capacity to wrap your head around it
[44:35] because he's got a plan he's got a plan
[44:40] and he doesn't want to bless you
[44:41] sparingly so he don't want you sowing
[44:44] sparingly or I think we'll move on if
[44:48] the timing of your harvest is often
[44:50] determined by what you do while you're
[44:52] waiting for it look at what Psalm 67
[44:54] verse 5 and 6 says let the people praise
[45:00] thanks sister Bonnie let the people
[45:03] praise the old God let all the people
[45:07] praise thee then I want you to say then
[45:11] that's the next verse oh this isn't I'm
[45:20] sorry oh good all right thank you thank
[45:26] you so much let the people praise the
[45:28] old God let all the people praise thee
[45:31] then shall the earth yield her increase
[45:36] say then when when is then let the
[45:45] people praise thee O God let the people
[45:49] praise thee O God then shall the earth
[45:53] yield her increase and God even our own
[45:58] God shall bless us I want to read it all
[46:02] again go back to the verse before
[46:04] let's read every bit of that again let
[46:06] the people praise the old God let all
[46:09] the people praise thee then shall the
[46:12] earth yield her increase then when when
[46:17] the people praise thee did you know that
[46:21] you're praised what'd you do what'd you
[46:24] do while you're waiting on your harvest
[46:31] helps to determine the timing of your
[46:34] harvest this verse
[46:37] almost bowled me out of the chair when I
[46:40] read that the earth is responding to
[46:45] rain on my seed and the earth has to
[46:51] turn loose of my seed when the rain
[46:54] falls on the earth the earth when praise
[46:57] is light rain when I praise the Lord
[47:01] it's light rain on my seed it's like oil
[47:05] anointing on my seed then shall the
[47:08] earth yield her increase and God even
[47:11] our own God
[47:12] shall bless us you want to know what to
[47:14] do while you're waiting on your harvest
[47:16] come on now why don't you practice it
[47:20] right now and say Lord I praise you
[47:23] because you are wonderful you are
[47:27] wonderful
[47:29] Lord I want you to rain on my seed I
[47:34] want you to rain on it remember don't
[47:37] despise it and if you have repent just
[47:39] go back to God Lord I let the enemy
[47:42] affect my emotion I cursed my seed with
[47:46] my own mouth I said I wished I had it
[47:49] back I wished I hadn't given it I wish
[47:52] that I would have done this I wish that
[47:54] I would have done that but Lord I repent
[47:56] right now I wouldn't give him that under
[48:00] men I was giving that unto you I repent
[48:03] of that cursing of my seed right now and
[48:06] I ask you Lord to give me grace to
[48:09] praise you while I wait how many of you
[48:14] have ever praised the Lord as though it
[48:15] was and though you had it in your hand
[48:16] you were praying for something and and
[48:20] praise that you felt anointing on your
[48:22] praise and you just started praising in
[48:24] advance and you just started worshipping
[48:27] God like you was already eating Tomatoes
[48:29] off
[48:31] this is a real important key the earth
[48:36] shall yield her increase and God shall
[48:40] bless us if we are faithful to praise
[48:43] the Lord in the beans in the bean field
[48:46] praise him over your seed if you're
[48:51] still with me say Amen
[48:52] it's 1243 I have time we didn't drag
[48:59] anybody here last night but we're here
[49:02] today we may not have any more Saturday
[49:06] night services for a while because I
[49:07] don't want to drag anybody here but
[49:10] don't Sunday I'm gonna let the Lord have
[49:11] his way you might as well determine to
[49:14] do the same you might as well determine
[49:17] they get a little praise going on in
[49:18] your field because some of you are
[49:21] hungry you're deprived and you don't
[49:28] realize it you're not eating as high on
[49:32] the hog excuse excuse the expression cuz
[49:36] that's not kosher eating you're not
[49:39] eating us how on the hog as you can and
[49:41] it may not be this you're not sowing
[49:44] seed you may be sowing seed and still
[49:47] not eating high on the hog it may be
[49:49] because of what you're doing while
[49:51] you're waiting on the seed I want you to
[49:53] know this what the Lord said and it's so
[49:55] very powerful and so very true there is
[49:57] life and there's something else in your
[50:02] mouth there is life and death you are a
[50:06] part you are a manifestation of a word
[50:10] that originated in God and was spoken
[50:14] into existence so word and spoken word
[50:20] is very much a part of your identity you
[50:24] could even say that it's a very big part
[50:26] of your spiritual DNA and therefore
[50:29] words are very important in your life
[50:32] what you say is very very important this
[50:37] is not this is not you know just the
[50:40] power of positive thinking and and and
[50:42] and you
[50:43] name it and claim it word of faith and
[50:45] blab it and grab it and whatever else
[50:46] it's not at all it's just a fixed law
[50:49] because you are a part of a word that
[50:51] was spoken you are an expression of a
[50:54] word that was spoken words are very
[50:57] important in your life and what comes
[50:59] out of your mouth is an overflow it is
[51:02] an abundance of what's already in your
[51:04] heart so if you don't want people to see
[51:07] what's in your heart keep your mouth
[51:09] shut because if you keep talking
[51:11] everybody's gonna know what you carry in
[51:14] your heart I want you to remember this
[51:18] every problem is a heart problem because
[51:24] your heart is directly connected to your
[51:26] soul and your soul is the seat of your
[51:30] mind your will and your emotions every
[51:35] problem that I have every problem that
[51:39] you have is a heart problem and that is
[51:44] one of the reasons why we must guard the
[51:48] garden because your inner life is a
[51:53] garden you are a garden on the inside
[52:00] it's interesting what God told Adam he
[52:04] said be fruitful and multiply and fill
[52:07] the earth interesting I read it this
[52:13] week from the book of Genesis I almost
[52:17] started with it this morning and then I
[52:19] thought if I announced my Texas Genesis
[52:22] everybody in the room will groan because
[52:25] they think it'll take all day to get to
[52:27] Revelation if we start in Genesis and so
[52:30] I didn't do it but I'll throw it in here
[52:32] now God said to Adam beef and Eve be
[52:34] fruitful and multiply and fill the earth
[52:36] he didn't just say fill the garden he
[52:39] said fill the earth Adam and Eve had a
[52:42] responsibility that was bigger than the
[52:44] garden interesting isn't it
[52:49] so don't you doubt for one minute that
[52:51] God didn't know they were gonna have to
[52:52] get out of the garden to fulfill what he
[52:54] called him to do in the beginning
[52:56] God told him to fill the earth to fill
[52:59] the earth they had to get out there
[53:01] God knew from the beginning they weren't
[53:03] gonna stay in the garden the garden
[53:05] represented something that's so much
[53:07] bigger and so much spiritual more
[53:09] spiritual than a geographical location
[53:12] the garden represented what God wants to
[53:15] do in us he wants to cultivate his word
[53:18] in us you are not only one who sow seed
[53:22] you are one who has received seed and
[53:24] there is seed laying in you that the
[53:28] enemy does not want to come to harvest
[53:30] maturity there is seed that you carry
[53:34] from God some of you came here with
[53:37] representation from your father with the
[53:40] deposit of that zowie life in you before
[53:43] you were ever born and before you were
[53:46] ever born again and that seed was added
[53:50] to on your mother's knee or in a Sunday
[53:53] School class our grandfather in the
[53:56] woods talking to you about the things of
[53:59] God or whatever a Bible story sitting in
[54:03] a doctor's office because every doctor's
[54:07] office used to have the picture Bible I
[54:09] don't know where you got it but you got
[54:12] it and then you came under the influence
[54:14] of a word that was sent from God a
[54:18] message that was sent from God I heard
[54:21] brother Branham say this week the
[54:23] purpose of this message is to prepare
[54:26] and perfect the bride simple he didn't
[54:33] send this word to form another
[54:35] denomination or to exclude somebody else
[54:40] he sent it to make sure his bride
[54:42] reaches her perfection and her
[54:45] completion and there's enough of the
[54:47] Word of God in you remember how the
[54:49] Prophet said everything you need to make
[54:51] the Raptors we're not on your bookshelf
[54:55] not on your smartphone not on your mp3
[55:01] player or the cassette tape our own the
[55:07] app
[55:08] and by the way we now have all of the
[55:11] sermons of brother Branham on the new
[55:12] hope app from 1962 all the way through
[55:15] to 1965 so nobody has to change apps to
[55:19] get anything by the Branham said from
[55:21] 1960 to 1965 is that right brother
[55:23] RJ so just visit it it's there we've had
[55:27] almost 700 people download the app I
[55:29] think we've had almost 8000 openings of
[55:34] that app and playing of some form of
[55:36] media and it goes on and on it's just
[55:40] the beginning one day I was rejoicing I
[55:43] said Oh Lord Thank You 600 and then the
[55:45] enemy said you know how many people
[55:47] there are in the world and you know what
[55:50] I told the enemy I may not be called to
[55:53] help every one of them but I sure do
[55:55] want to help the ones I've been called
[55:57] to help and you know what he did he shut
[56:00] up he shut up I was praying in the
[56:10] office one day this week know the end of
[56:14] last week and I was praying in the
[56:17] office about something doesn't matter
[56:19] what I was praying about but I heard the
[56:21] Lord speak oh yes he speaks I heard him
[56:26] speak right in here and he said don't
[56:28] ever forget other sheep I have that are
[56:32] not of this fold I got other people out
[56:37] there that I can get their ear I can
[56:42] speak to them and that's why when the
[56:45] check came in the mail this week I could
[56:47] rejoice because the Lord confirmed his
[56:52] word I'll tell you about that later
[56:54] because the Lord confirmed his word
[56:56] listen God can speak to anybody that
[56:59] will give him half a chance and listen
[57:00] come on now he knows how he knows how we
[57:05] hear this all the time that God knows
[57:07] how there is a transfer of wealth and
[57:10] blessing there has to be for the harvest
[57:15] there has to be for the final one the
[57:18] last one to hear what they need to hear
[57:21] God has to finance the harvest it's up
[57:24] to him to do it we put our trust in him
[57:27] we saw our see we don't despise the seed
[57:29] we sow we water them with praise we weed
[57:32] them we weed out those thoughts that the
[57:35] enemy sins to try to choke out the seed
[57:37] so that we don't get a harvest come on
[57:39] now and and if the enemy approaches we
[57:42] pick up anything and everything we can
[57:43] get our hands on that looks like a
[57:45] weapon it might be a jawbone of an ass
[57:52] it might be a it might be an ox code we
[57:57] pick up whatever we can get ahold of and
[58:00] we say to the enemy I know what you're
[58:04] counting on me to do you're counting on
[58:06] me to fly you're counting on me to flee
[58:12] because I have run from you you dirty
[58:15] dog in the past whoa
[58:20] but I'm here to tell you devil tell him
[58:22] I'm not running this time I'm not
[58:26] running this time I'd rather die on my
[58:29] principles
[58:31] I'd rather die guarding my harvest if I
[58:35] run from the enemy I know what he's
[58:37] gonna do he's gonna shoot me in the back
[58:39] how many of you know you can't trust the
[58:41] devil how many of you know you can't
[58:43] trust the enemy you haven't been here
[58:45] too long yet hold on you can't trust the
[58:49] devil you run from him he'll shoot you
[58:52] in the back what a coward
[58:54] he'll kill you he'll shoot you in the
[58:56] back of the head he'll sneak up on you
[58:59] and you won't even know what happened
[59:00] the only way if you've got two back if
[59:02] you've got to get away you better back
[59:04] away but I challenge you not to abandon
[59:09] your seed hallelujah you know what I
[59:14] wished I was there I wished I was down
[59:18] there listening to this I promise you I
[59:21] could do a better job supporting the
[59:22] preacher than some of you can do I've
[59:24] promised you I would because I really
[59:28] believe that it is imperative and vital
[59:32] for some
[59:34] to get militant we have no problem
[59:38] fighting with one another biting and
[59:41] devouring one another what we need to do
[59:43] is stand together united against a
[59:45] common devil and tell him i'm not going
[59:49] to abandon my seed hallelujah
[59:54] i'm on a garden the harvest okay got a
[59:57] hurry
[59:57] got to go wow wow wow wow wow thank you
[1:00:02] so much that was our number one here's
[1:00:05] our number two we all know that King
[1:00:08] David was a great leader Amen he
[1:00:12] combined in himself the qualities of
[1:00:13] bravery and compassion and integrity
[1:00:16] that made other men rally to his cause
[1:00:19] the Bible tells us that within his army
[1:00:22] of soldiers there were 30-plus warriors
[1:00:24] who might in today's terms be called
[1:00:27] special forces how many of you know
[1:00:29] David had Special Forces the Bible calls
[1:00:32] them what you remember david's mighty
[1:00:35] men a small militia of extraordinary
[1:00:40] skilled war warriors these men were the
[1:00:43] best of the best the strongest of the
[1:00:44] strong the bravest of the brave the ones
[1:00:47] who would not flinch under fire the men
[1:00:50] on whom you could depend if you were
[1:00:52] surrounded by the enemy to put it in
[1:00:55] another context or some of you that
[1:00:56] might be more familiar with this you
[1:00:59] could take all of the modern heroes and
[1:01:02] put their qualities together and you
[1:01:06] would find the kind of power the kind of
[1:01:09] strength the kind of courage that was in
[1:01:13] david's mighty men you could take rambo
[1:01:19] bruce lee the terminator
[1:01:23] i know these are older ones i'm more for
[1:01:28] me he's coming see us and finally chuck
[1:01:32] norris
[1:01:37] I know more about the older ones and I
[1:01:40] do the newer ones you put all the
[1:01:43] fightin power and strength courage that
[1:01:50] those men displayed fictitiously and you
[1:01:54] place that in david's mighty men because
[1:01:57] everything you think chuck norris is
[1:02:01] david's mighty men really were yes sir
[1:02:07] so much so that out of the 30 plus and I
[1:02:12] say that because their name two places
[1:02:14] and the lists are not exactly the same
[1:02:18] and some people believe that some of
[1:02:22] them appear in both lists with a
[1:02:25] different name I'm not I tried to go
[1:02:28] down that road and I saw that was gonna
[1:02:30] take me on a on a theological something
[1:02:34] that I wasn't interested in right now
[1:02:35] maybe I'll search that out another time
[1:02:37] but there's a lot of debate about this
[1:02:40] so I just went back and added a plus to
[1:02:42] my to my notes 30 plus out of that 30
[1:02:46] plus above that 30 plus there were three
[1:02:49] that are mentioned in the in second
[1:02:52] Samuel in a list of David's mighty men
[1:02:55] as his bodyguards and of the 30 plus
[1:03:00] these three were mentioned as rising
[1:03:04] above and going beyond the rest but
[1:03:09] their exploits and the testimonies of
[1:03:12] their service is something that souls
[1:03:15] have been sung about and sermons have
[1:03:18] been preached about David's mighty men
[1:03:20] and if you will turn this morning in the
[1:03:24] time that we are taking turn to 2nd
[1:03:29] Samuel chapter 23 verse 11 and 12 and
[1:03:34] this is where I want to begin you mean
[1:03:38] what was the first hour that was getting
[1:03:40] us to this place and after him was Shama
[1:03:48] the son of a G
[1:03:50] the horite and the Philistines were
[1:03:54] gathered together into a troop where was
[1:03:57] a piece of ground full of lentils and
[1:03:59] the people fled from the Philistines who
[1:04:04] do you think that was the people that
[1:04:06] was David's allies that was his fellow
[1:04:11] comrades Seamus comrades not David's
[1:04:17] Seamus the people fled from the
[1:04:21] Philistines but he stood in the midst of
[1:04:26] the ground this is 2nd Samuel 23 I
[1:04:29] believe verse 11 and 12 do I have that
[1:04:34] wrong I could you read along all right
[1:04:36] good but he stood in the midst of the
[1:04:39] ground and defended it he stood in the
[1:04:43] midst of the ground and defended it next
[1:04:47] verse and slew the Philistines he stood
[1:04:55] in the midst of the ground and defended
[1:05:00] it and slew the Philistines and the Lord
[1:05:05] wrought a great victory how many of you
[1:05:11] know what I'm talking about
[1:05:12] did you know brother Branham never
[1:05:14] preached on Shama all the thousands of
[1:05:18] sermons he preached that we have our own
[1:05:21] record there are hundreds and hundreds
[1:05:23] that we don't have on tape he preached
[1:05:25] on another one of the mighty men Shankar
[1:05:28] and there are many people who believe
[1:05:31] that this is the same man Shama and Shem
[1:05:34] gar and that you have to take both both
[1:05:37] tellings to get the whole story but I'm
[1:05:40] not going to make that assumption this
[1:05:42] morning I'm going to take it just like
[1:05:43] it it reads here I want to go over this
[1:05:48] with you for just a moment and I know
[1:05:49] you're some of you're tired and I know
[1:05:51] some of you have lost interest already
[1:05:53] but I've come to give you something that
[1:05:56] could have impact your life amen and I
[1:06:01] know that that our attention deficit
[1:06:03] disorder
[1:06:04] from cell phone addiction is kicking in
[1:06:08] this morning and maybe the horns are
[1:06:12] already growing on the base of your your
[1:06:14] neck and your spine there because you've
[1:06:16] now read the medical report
[1:06:18] where they're finding that children and
[1:06:21] young people are coming in and they're
[1:06:23] they're having knobs forming a bone on
[1:06:27] the base of their skull horns say look
[1:06:31] like one doctor called them horns and
[1:06:33] they're forming there because people are
[1:06:36] spending so much time like this and it's
[1:06:40] so unhealthy for the body in fact they
[1:06:43] have said I read another article this
[1:06:45] week that said that it will not be like
[1:06:48] the hunchbacks that we used to see from
[1:06:52] time to time but it will be as bad and
[1:06:56] more common 20 years from now we know if
[1:07:03] Jesus terry's they're not saying
[1:07:05] anything about that it will be more
[1:07:08] common to see people in their 30s and
[1:07:10] 40s beginning to snoop over all of that
[1:07:15] directly related to how much time they
[1:07:17] spend on their phone with their head
[1:07:19] crunched over like that interesting
[1:07:21] isn't it you've got to use your phone I
[1:07:24] understand but you better learn to hold
[1:07:25] your head straight and then I'll know if
[1:07:29] you're using it in church if you hold it
[1:07:34] up high like that you you know I don't I
[1:07:38] don't particularly like this thought
[1:07:40] because I depend on mine a lot and it's
[1:07:43] easy to get a little offended but I want
[1:07:45] to tell you something it is definitely
[1:07:47] affecting the way we pay attention I
[1:07:52] feel sorry for teachers I feel sorry for
[1:07:56] teachers in the schools and even home
[1:07:58] school who have to try to capture the
[1:08:01] attention of their children in a hurry
[1:08:04] cuz their mind is constantly scrolling
[1:08:07] to the next thought it's interesting
[1:08:09] isn't it I know some of you are
[1:08:11] struggling with that this morning but
[1:08:13] the Lord must have known all of that
[1:08:15] when he was pouring into me
[1:08:18] so here we go I don't know how big the
[1:08:20] field was that Shama stood in but what I
[1:08:24] know is the Bible said it was loaded
[1:08:27] with lentils it was full of lentils
[1:08:30] lentils or legumes small bean or pea
[1:08:35] like balls that grow in a pod and
[1:08:38] they're flat usually in the Bible of a
[1:08:42] reddish-brown color even though a lot of
[1:08:45] times what we get are darker gray or
[1:08:47] black now in the Bible they were a very
[1:08:50] important staple food in both the Middle
[1:08:54] East and the Near East
[1:08:56] these littles were needed to provide
[1:08:58] food for the children of Israel who were
[1:09:02] living in that area in English Lehi
[1:09:06] littles could were amazing because they
[1:09:10] could be eaten fresh which I don't know
[1:09:12] anything about never had them that way
[1:09:14] or they could be dried this is how we're
[1:09:18] more familiar with lentils today and
[1:09:20] preserved so that you could eat all the
[1:09:23] way through when there was nothing to
[1:09:26] harvest so I'm not excited about lentils
[1:09:29] I'll be honest they're just not all that
[1:09:32] exciting to me and and they work on you
[1:09:36] I'm going to tell you that right now I'm
[1:09:37] not trying to be common but they work on
[1:09:39] you like pintos and all the rest of them
[1:09:43] somebody scrab me another water pretty
[1:09:45] pretty pretty please whoever can and
[1:09:48] will I knew when I come out here this
[1:09:51] was going to be a - water sermon so they
[1:09:57] were important because they could last
[1:09:59] way on into the season when nothing was
[1:10:03] growing I want you to notice how
[1:10:05] strategic the devil is how strategic the
[1:10:08] enemy is the Philistines waited until
[1:10:12] the field was full of lentils they did
[1:10:15] not attack thank you so much they did
[1:10:18] not attack when the Israelites were
[1:10:20] plowing the field and breaking up the
[1:10:22] ground they did not attack when the
[1:10:28] Israelites had their sack of seed
[1:10:30] and we're walking through the field
[1:10:32] sowing seed they did not attack when
[1:10:36] they were hoeing out the weeds are
[1:10:38] caring for the crop but they waited
[1:10:42] until the field was full of lentils it
[1:10:46] was harvest time and there were probably
[1:10:51] harvesters in the field these were not
[1:10:54] soldiers as we might suppose they were
[1:10:58] farmers and they were doing what anybody
[1:11:02] does when they plant a crop and it comes
[1:11:06] in they they know they've got to get it
[1:11:08] in it's important not to waste the work
[1:11:11] the labor and the effort that goes in to
[1:11:13] planning a field like that the Bible
[1:11:18] said the Philistines banded together
[1:11:21] they gathered together in a troop in
[1:11:24] King James in Hebrew that's exactly what
[1:11:27] it reads it's it reads as a military
[1:11:29] troop and what that means is in fact
[1:11:33] another Bible translation says they
[1:11:35] mustered for battle what that says to us
[1:11:40] is that the Philistines assembled their
[1:11:42] army and they were prepared this wasn't
[1:11:47] a casual attack it wasn't a spontaneous
[1:11:50] attack it was a well kakhiel calculated
[1:11:54] strategic attack on this little field
[1:11:57] they were ready they inventoried their
[1:12:01] equipment they assessed their readiness
[1:12:03] for the upcoming fight they came in out
[1:12:06] of the hill country in attack mode
[1:12:10] well-prepared the word Philistines means
[1:12:13] immigrants it means those who wander in
[1:12:18] and out of a country isn't that it's
[1:12:22] interesting in light of the Palestinians
[1:12:25] who are named after the Philistines who
[1:12:28] are not not fighting for their homeland
[1:12:31] it never was their homeland they have
[1:12:33] always wondered in and out they followed
[1:12:36] the crops they followed prosperity they
[1:12:41] looked for opportunity to bless
[1:12:44] themselves with the labor of someone
[1:12:47] else in the Bible days there were
[1:12:50] thieves it kind of explains to us today
[1:12:54] why when Israel withdrew from the Gaza
[1:12:56] they went in and destroyed the carrot
[1:12:59] farms farms that were were acclaimed all
[1:13:03] over the world because they were growing
[1:13:05] the most amazing sweet carrots that were
[1:13:08] being exported all over Europe and even
[1:13:10] into Russia and people loved those
[1:13:13] carrots and they were there the
[1:13:15] Israelite the Jews when they left the
[1:13:17] Israelis when they left they didn't
[1:13:19] destroy the fields they left everything
[1:13:22] just like it was and withdrew when the
[1:13:25] Palestinians went in they burned the
[1:13:27] greenhouses they destroyed the fields
[1:13:29] they tore down the farms does that make
[1:13:32] any sense to you at all
[1:13:34] it speaks of people who come in and out
[1:13:36] or take advantage and and and and truly
[1:13:39] are not really using a lot of wisdom
[1:13:41] it's about hatred it's about destruction
[1:13:44] it's not about being smart for your
[1:13:46] people you don't have to say man it's
[1:13:47] just too obvious isn't it First Samuel
[1:13:50] chapter 23 we just read second Samuel 23
[1:13:54] First Samuel 23 tells us that this was a
[1:13:57] strategy that the Philistines operated
[1:14:00] in multiple times then they told David
[1:14:04] verse 1 saying behold the Philistines
[1:14:06] fight against Kela and they robbed the
[1:14:09] threshing floors look at what kind of a
[1:14:15] spirit was on the enemy they didn't come
[1:14:18] to the field every time and try to take
[1:14:20] the harvest while it was being harvested
[1:14:23] look folk they didn't want to work they
[1:14:28] didn't want to reap the harvest they
[1:14:29] didn't want to come in and run they
[1:14:31] wanted to wait here until it was already
[1:14:34] at the threshing floor we don't want to
[1:14:38] pick it we don't want to tote it we
[1:14:39] don't want to win to it we don't want to
[1:14:41] break it and beat it we just want to
[1:14:43] wait till it's on the threshing floor
[1:14:45] and come in and steal it now in that
[1:14:49] like the devil he's not just after
[1:14:51] what's growing in your field
[1:14:55] if he could he would steal what you've
[1:14:57] already harvested you better hear this
[1:15:01] if the enemy is allowed to he will steal
[1:15:06] what you've already given birth to he'll
[1:15:15] he won't wait
[1:15:18] he'll come he doesn't matter to him the
[1:15:24] his objective is to keep you from having
[1:15:27] what you sold and labored for enjoying
[1:15:31] the benefit he'll come for your children
[1:15:34] that's part of your seat he'll come
[1:15:38] he absolutely will and so today we're
[1:15:41] facing the same kind of enemy that these
[1:15:43] Philistines were our enemy is strategic
[1:15:47] he is well prepared he wants your
[1:15:51] harvest I wish you could help me he
[1:15:55] wants your harvest he wants the fruit of
[1:15:58] your labor
[1:15:59] he watched you prepare the field he
[1:16:02] watched you sow the seed he watched you
[1:16:05] hoe and pull the weed he watched your
[1:16:07] tender plants beginning to grow and now
[1:16:10] he wants to move in as you begin to see
[1:16:14] the fruit of your labor he's carefully
[1:16:18] timing his attack so that when some of
[1:16:21] our efforts begin to mature when we
[1:16:25] start moving forward in some areas of
[1:16:27] our life and seeing some progress and
[1:16:30] enjoying a little bit of the blessing of
[1:16:32] the Lord here comes that dirty devil
[1:16:37] wanting to steal the harvest that you're
[1:16:41] already holding in your hand he's a liar
[1:16:44] he's a liar and the father of all eyes
[1:16:47] John 10:10 the thief comes only to steal
[1:16:52] and to kill and destroy Jesus talking I
[1:16:56] came that they might have life and have
[1:16:59] it more abundantly
[1:17:01] verse 11 tells us in second Samuel 23
[1:17:06] and the people fled from the Philistines
[1:17:10] it's obvious from this passage that the
[1:17:13] far majority of the people of Israel
[1:17:15] were allowing fear to control them
[1:17:20] and they had given in and they were
[1:17:23] carrying a defeated frame of mind you
[1:17:29] know it's it's just hardly fair to fight
[1:17:33] against an enemy that's already give up
[1:17:37] if you've already given up it seems
[1:17:42] unfair for the enemy to fight against
[1:17:45] you but if you have any idea that the
[1:17:47] devil is fair you don't know him like I
[1:17:51] know him he's not fair he don't care if
[1:17:55] you've given up he doesn't care if
[1:17:56] you're discouraged he helped you get
[1:17:58] there he doesn't care if you've cursed
[1:18:01] your seed if you've carried an attitude
[1:18:05] that has affected your harvest he didn't
[1:18:07] care he wants what you've got he wants
[1:18:11] what's coming to you he is the original
[1:18:14] kleptomaniac it will do him no good he
[1:18:18] steals for the joy of watching you do it
[1:18:20] out the devil is out for your joy what's
[1:18:24] he gonna do your joy nothing he just
[1:18:27] doesn't want you to have it come on he
[1:18:30] wants your milk money he's not gonna buy
[1:18:33] milk with your milk money he just don't
[1:18:35] want you to have no milk boy that ought
[1:18:38] to make you stirred come on now so you
[1:18:43] look around one day and you see the
[1:18:46] enemy coming over the hill and this is
[1:18:48] not new to you because you know this is
[1:18:52] the strategy of the Philistines you're
[1:18:54] just wondering why they're coming now
[1:18:56] and not wait until you get all the
[1:18:57] harvests then and you look around and
[1:19:01] you start talking to your buddies hey
[1:19:03] guys look what's happening they're
[1:19:06] coming in all around us they're ready to
[1:19:09] not only take us out they're ready to
[1:19:13] steal the harvest what are we gonna do
[1:19:15] you look around to see if you can get
[1:19:17] somebody to stand with you and guess
[1:19:19] what you find out there
[1:19:21] already gone there's no feet but there's
[1:19:27] plenty of sandals they've run right out
[1:19:31] of them nobody is going to help you
[1:19:35] Britta and listen now that we have no
[1:19:38] idea that that was Seamus field we don't
[1:19:44] know if one man had a feel we don't know
[1:19:47] how big the feel us we don't know how
[1:19:51] many were there we don't know how many
[1:19:54] farmers were there and how many soldiers
[1:19:56] were there we know very little about
[1:19:57] this story really if you look at it far
[1:20:01] less about this than many of the Bible
[1:20:03] stories that are not stories they're
[1:20:05] real true happenings I believe them to
[1:20:07] be we have no reason to believe that
[1:20:10] Sheva was any more emotionally attached
[1:20:13] to these beans than anybody else was I
[1:20:20] want you to know he wasn't fighting over
[1:20:22] beans for Shama this was a whole lot
[1:20:28] bigger than beans I can get me some more
[1:20:32] beans but if I do if I if I let the
[1:20:36] devil steal these beans he'll come back
[1:20:39] for my tacos he'll come back for my
[1:20:43] burrito he'll come back for the whole
[1:20:45] enchilada here it you cannot let the
[1:20:52] enemy take anything that belongs to you
[1:20:56] and if he already has tell him you
[1:21:00] caught him I caught you I recognize that
[1:21:06] you have stolen from my life and I
[1:21:11] command you I demand you to give it back
[1:21:15] you have touched my health when the
[1:21:20] scripture said I don't have to be sick
[1:21:24] I'm old but I don't have to be sick and
[1:21:28] old I'm gonna die but I don't have to
[1:21:34] die sick tell the devil you just don't
[1:21:39] want me to hold any grains any sheaves
[1:21:49] any fruit of harvest for the seed that
[1:21:53] I've sown you want me not only to be
[1:21:57] bankrupt but you want me to feel
[1:21:59] bankrupt you want me to think bankrupt
[1:22:04] you want to intimidate me from sowing
[1:22:08] any more seed Wow because look what
[1:22:14] happened to the seed you sowed the devil
[1:22:17] ate ate tacos with it so why would you
[1:22:20] keep sowing come on now I don't want to
[1:22:24] give the devil any credit I don't want
[1:22:26] to build him up I don't want to exalt
[1:22:28] him in any way but neither do I want
[1:22:30] anybody to be ignorant of his devices he
[1:22:33] is a sly old Fox come on now he is very
[1:22:38] calculated and very strategic and and he
[1:22:41] doesn't do anything spontaneously he has
[1:22:44] already plotted his course he knows
[1:22:47] exactly how to shut you up and shut you
[1:22:50] down
[1:22:52] he will bankrupt your thoughts before he
[1:22:56] goes after your bank account because if
[1:23:02] you quit sowing of yourself and from
[1:23:06] yourself you have no future hope of
[1:23:09] harvest
[1:23:12] if you can't war over the seed you've
[1:23:15] already planted you'll stop planting
[1:23:16] eventually it'll mean nothing to you
[1:23:20] being faithful to God's house will mean
[1:23:23] nothing to you being faithful in your
[1:23:25] giving will mean nothing to you having a
[1:23:29] right attitude and a right spirit when
[1:23:31] you come will mean nothing to you
[1:23:35] because
[1:23:36] the enemy has shut down with his with
[1:23:40] his crows he has shut down your your
[1:23:43] ability to see above and beyond your
[1:23:48] present circumstances I want you to know
[1:23:51] that a man who cannot see beyond today
[1:23:54] with hope and promise for the future is
[1:23:58] already dead he's a dead man walking he
[1:24:04] has no purpose for living if a man is
[1:24:07] convinced that he no longer has a seed
[1:24:09] to sow he has no reason to go on so
[1:24:13] you've got to take that back you've got
[1:24:16] to tell the devil he's a liar you've got
[1:24:18] to tell him God would leave you here one
[1:24:20] hour beyond your appointed time on this
[1:24:23] earth and if you're still kicking and
[1:24:25] breathing and moving and groaning you've
[1:24:29] still got a seed to sow you still have
[1:24:33] value to release but the devil but the
[1:24:39] devil but the devil but the Felicity I
[1:24:41] know those I know how he works he's
[1:24:44] after every one of us but he's a liar
[1:24:47] and you cannot do what everybody else
[1:24:52] does and expect to get different results
[1:24:57] if you do what everybody else does
[1:25:00] you're gonna get what everybody else
[1:25:01] gets it's like if you always do what
[1:25:08] you've always done you'll always be what
[1:25:09] you always been you know how we do
[1:25:13] reasoning in our mind but look at sister
[1:25:14] so-and-so mm-hmm well look at brother
[1:25:17] so-and-so that's part of our problem
[1:25:19] right there you better quit looking at
[1:25:21] all of them because if you are expecting
[1:25:24] somebody else to help you guard your
[1:25:27] seed in Satan's Eden you may be
[1:25:32] extremely disappointed because you may
[1:25:38] value what's underneath the ground what
[1:25:40] you've planted what you've invested but
[1:25:42] there may be nobody else who values it
[1:25:44] the way you value
[1:25:46] and you cannot expect I have had to come
[1:25:49] to that conclusion if God gives you
[1:25:51] somebody to fight with you for your
[1:25:54] harvest you better shout all over this
[1:25:57] church you better tell Ian and Milly and
[1:26:02] everybody else get out of my way I'm
[1:26:05] gonna run
[1:26:06] come on the hell I am so thankful I'm so
[1:26:12] thankful that God has been so good to
[1:26:16] give me some buddies who are willing to
[1:26:20] help me fight for my seed but I could
[1:26:26] look around tomorrow and half of them be
[1:26:30] gone or all of them be gone
[1:26:34] I can't fight because they fight I gotta
[1:26:37] fight because I have an investment that
[1:26:42] seed cost me something I said yes and
[1:26:47] because I said yes I've got to fight for
[1:26:50] the harvest that's attached to my ass we
[1:26:56] may feel alone sometime we may be alone
[1:26:59] sometime but a lot of the times we've
[1:27:01] got somebody fighting with us on our on
[1:27:03] their knees and I know we need to feel
[1:27:06] them I know we need gods with skin on
[1:27:08] them I understand that absolutely
[1:27:10] completely but I want you to know you
[1:27:12] can't count on that and if you feel
[1:27:17] completely forsaken don't forsake your
[1:27:20] seed break the cycle they all left him
[1:27:25] Hey
[1:27:29] the people fled his ally sleds Shama
[1:27:35] chose to fight while others chose to
[1:27:38] flee it seems that most of the
[1:27:41] Israelites didn't like the idea of
[1:27:43] fighting the Philistines in the middle
[1:27:45] of a bean field they favored this just
[1:27:49] just to remember try not to call them
[1:27:51] cowards they were once friends
[1:27:57] try not to call them cowards I like to
[1:28:01] look at it this way they they uh they
[1:28:04] favored making a strategic withdrawal to
[1:28:08] a different location if you examine the
[1:28:13] field I did I examined the field and I
[1:28:17] decided that in many ways they were
[1:28:20] smarter to do what they did then Shamu
[1:28:25] was to do what he did but what a smarts
[1:28:29] have to do with it anyway
[1:28:31] intellect will bring you into direct
[1:28:35] conflict with the mind of God you got to
[1:28:38] be willing to lay that down
[1:28:40] these guys were smarter maybe than shama
[1:28:42] they said it is not smart to fight an
[1:28:47] army in a bean field they are on the
[1:28:51] mountains they have a greater advantage
[1:28:56] we are standing in a large field no
[1:28:58] cover no place to hide with bean vines
[1:29:02] knee-deep if you need to slip out god
[1:29:07] bless you thank you for coming
[1:29:09] I understand do you know what happens in
[1:29:13] a field full of vines you jump up and
[1:29:21] you start moving and your dragon bean
[1:29:25] vines you be in a wrapped-up tied up
[1:29:30] tingled up mess in a hurry whenever you
[1:29:36] stand up out of the field the enemy sees
[1:29:40] you you're an instant target there's
[1:29:43] nowhere to hide in the bean vine field
[1:29:45] the enemy can attack from all sides at
[1:29:48] once in whatever numbers he can muster
[1:29:50] so it's easy to find yourself surrounded
[1:29:52] by people who would rather kill you
[1:29:55] than to say hello no wonder they ran no
[1:30:01] wonder they were it was a bean patch
[1:30:04] it wasn't a good place for a battlefield
[1:30:07] but what will you do when your harvest
[1:30:11] field becomes a battlefield will you fly
[1:30:16] or will you fight it's a question that
[1:30:21] you and I have to answer for ourselves
[1:30:25] even though we may be compelled to know
[1:30:28] what is right it's a lifelong commitment
[1:30:32] it's a decision that will cost you and
[1:30:36] shamah counted the cost he laid down his
[1:30:42] own Smart's he said it may not be smart
[1:30:45] but I got to do it even even some
[1:30:49] Christians may suggest that the bean
[1:30:51] patches that were fighting for their
[1:30:54] bigger hills to down but Shama was tired
[1:30:58] of watching his part of the harvest
[1:30:59] stolen away before it could bless and
[1:31:01] sustain his family wait just a minute
[1:31:05] I got a family in Israel that has to eat
[1:31:09] and they love burritos
[1:31:16] we have a corn patch over there and we
[1:31:20] can make us some corn bread but we
[1:31:23] really like burritos and I love my
[1:31:28] family and I'm tired of the devil
[1:31:30] stealing their burritos I don't eat a
[1:31:35] lot of burritos myself but I like them
[1:31:39] when I do but my family likes them and
[1:31:44] I'm sick of the devil coming for my
[1:31:45] burritos and I know the burrito doesn't
[1:31:49] start out at the ED Taco Bell thank God
[1:31:52] the burrito starts out in the bean field
[1:31:57] so I go to go and fight in the parking
[1:32:00] lot of Taco Bell I got a fight where it
[1:32:03] all starts I got a fight where my seed
[1:32:07] went into the ground oh my and that's
[1:32:10] why I'm standing here Shama was tired of
[1:32:13] watching the part his part of the
[1:32:15] harvest stolen away before it could
[1:32:16] bless and sustain his family
[1:32:18] defending the bean patch might have seen
[1:32:21] rather insignificant to own lookers or
[1:32:23] to others who didn't value the fields
[1:32:26] but the Bible said in verse 12 he stood
[1:32:29] in the midst of the plot he stood there
[1:32:35] but from the middle of the field Shama
[1:32:38] had a different perspective
[1:32:42] he had a bean patch perspective he
[1:32:47] looked around in those beans never
[1:32:50] looked so valuable as they did that day
[1:32:54] it was like gold to him that day because
[1:32:58] it was more than about the beans it was
[1:33:01] about his family it was about sustaining
[1:33:04] his people it was about taking the
[1:33:06] promise of the promised land it was
[1:33:08] about claiming everything that God had
[1:33:12] promised it was about shutting down the
[1:33:15] enemy - Shama it wasn't just a fight in
[1:33:21] a bean field it was a fight over a bean
[1:33:27] patch if you're a believer you need to
[1:33:32] understand right now as weary as you are
[1:33:35] you need to understand right now there
[1:33:38] is a turf war that's going on there are
[1:33:45] some green fat juicy worms getting ready
[1:33:50] to march against your field there is a
[1:33:53] turf war going on it is all around us if
[1:33:59] you had an opportunity to see any of the
[1:34:04] of the events of this week you saw ten
[1:34:07] juicy green worms standing on a platform
[1:34:17] desiring look to devour your burrito
[1:34:24] it's true
[1:34:26] it is true
[1:34:29] how many of you would support in your
[1:34:32] health care plan how many of you would
[1:34:34] support healthcare for illegal aliens
[1:34:38] ever hand went up think about it think
[1:34:44] about it you're not here legally there's
[1:34:47] a legal way to get here but since you
[1:34:50] got by with it let me take care of you
[1:34:53] in the hospital there are citizens who
[1:34:56] can't afford to go but let us make sure
[1:35:00] that we're humanitarian do you see how
[1:35:03] the enemy knows how to twist everything
[1:35:06] to play on the sympathy and you see
[1:35:11] where where one of them where where
[1:35:13] where Pocahontas did you see where she
[1:35:16] chose to celebrate her birthday with the
[1:35:20] directors of Planned Parenthood can you
[1:35:23] expect her to stand for life of course
[1:35:25] not she's a green worm in the field Oh
[1:35:32] ready to eat your harvest won't tell you
[1:35:35] something you got a bigger enemy than
[1:35:37] that to deal with she don't know you
[1:35:40] exist those people on that platform they
[1:35:45] don't know you exist but there is an
[1:35:48] enemy that knows your name he knows your
[1:35:50] address he knows every seed you've sown
[1:35:55] he knows your hope he knows your
[1:35:57] expectation he knows your and his guns
[1:36:02] are turned on you his guns are turned on
[1:36:05] me he wants my burrito it's the truth I
[1:36:15] got a hurry first time I think I've said
[1:36:18] it I'm gonna page 7 of 14 so I will stop
[1:36:22] at some point this was very personal to
[1:36:27] Shama
[1:36:31] this has got to be very personal to you
[1:36:35] if you were the only one the devil was
[1:36:38] after you got to face it like you're the
[1:36:40] only target your family is the only one
[1:36:44] the devil hates come on now you've got
[1:36:47] to get that kind of a mindset he's after
[1:36:50] me he's after my children he's after my
[1:36:53] family he's after every seed that I've
[1:36:55] ever sewn into the kingdom of God if
[1:36:58] nobody else will stand with me in my
[1:37:00] bean patch I have a responsibility I
[1:37:04] would rather die I would rather die
[1:37:06] where I planted my seed I would rather
[1:37:09] die invested my value I would
[1:37:11] rather die where I sowed for the kingdom
[1:37:17] than to run from the devil and be shot
[1:37:20] in the rear no retreat no retirement in
[1:37:30] the army of the Lord you think you're
[1:37:33] miserable now you just wait you just
[1:37:39] wait till he starts picking them off one
[1:37:40] by one you just wait till he starts
[1:37:45] moving among the things that you value
[1:37:48] and treasure the most you'll fight
[1:37:52] you'll fight like a wild man you'll
[1:37:54] fight like a wild woman then I pray you
[1:37:57] don't wait too late come on now it's
[1:38:02] time to get a warrior spirit sometimes
[1:38:06] it's not about whether or not you can
[1:38:08] kill the enemy it's about whether you
[1:38:11] can stand against the enemy and not let
[1:38:13] him have what God has given to you you
[1:38:17] may not stop him from his ambition just
[1:38:21] yet but you can strip him of his power
[1:38:24] and authority in your bean patch not
[1:38:29] mine come on now all right Satan wants
[1:38:34] to steal from the bride's territory he
[1:38:37] wants to steal from her jurisdiction and
[1:38:39] her Dominion he wants to usurp her
[1:38:43] authority to sidetrack you from your
[1:38:47] destiny Satan wants to cut you off from
[1:38:51] your source of nourishment he wants you
[1:38:54] to spiritually wither in the field he
[1:38:58] desires to weaken you so that he can
[1:39:01] simply walk off with your inheritance
[1:39:05] and with your harvest
[1:39:08] neshama it was personal something had to
[1:39:10] be done
[1:39:11] he had a cause although he did not
[1:39:14] exactly have everything going for him he
[1:39:18] was not necessarily a likely candidate
[1:39:20] for this battle let me quickly tell you
[1:39:23] why Shamas father was named aji while
[1:39:27] there is no clear consensus on the
[1:39:29] meaning of his name the International
[1:39:32] Standard Bible encyclopedia says that a
[1:39:35] G means fugitive one who flees standing
[1:39:44] firm for a cause was not a part of
[1:39:47] Shamas DNA his daddy was a runner his
[1:39:55] daddy was one who fleed as a fugitive so
[1:40:01] Sherma wasn't getting it from his
[1:40:03] bloodline he was getting it from his
[1:40:05] faith come on now guess what his name
[1:40:10] means waste desolation astonishment the
[1:40:18] most respected Hebrew dictionary in the
[1:40:21] world says that the name Shama means a
[1:40:25] horror I know what a horror movie is or
[1:40:31] a horror story I've never thought about
[1:40:33] a man being a horror somehow it doesn't
[1:40:38] feel Noble it doesn't feel holy so his
[1:40:43] daddy is a fugitive like brother
[1:40:46] branham's running from the law he had a
[1:40:54] lot stacked against him didn't he but he
[1:40:57] surrendered too
[1:40:57] call you and I have to do the same thing
[1:41:00] show him his own name
[1:41:02] why would his mama give him a name that
[1:41:04] meant a horror must have been a rough
[1:41:07] labor in delivery mama what do you want
[1:41:12] to call it a horror I know I'll grow to
[1:41:17] living but right now get him out of my
[1:41:19] face then the Bible says that he was a
[1:41:24] high right that word in Hebrew
[1:41:28] means hill in Hebrew Herrara D is the
[1:41:34] plural of a noun that means a mountain
[1:41:36] dweller likely from the hill country of
[1:41:39] Judea you know what that means it means
[1:41:42] that in his community because he was
[1:41:44] from the heights because he was from the
[1:41:46] mountains he would have been considered
[1:41:48] a bumpkin a hillbilly
[1:41:52] so Shamas daddy was a fugitive running
[1:41:55] from the law his mother called him a
[1:41:57] horror and his whole entire clan were
[1:42:00] known as hillbillies and mountain
[1:42:02] bumpkins and yet all of his friends who
[1:42:09] came with beautiful pedigrees beautiful
[1:42:12] family Linnet ran ran like little girls
[1:42:15] ran retreated to a more convenient place
[1:42:27] but the battle wasn't going to be in the
[1:42:29] woods because that day God was jealous
[1:42:34] over the bean patch tomorrow he might be
[1:42:38] jealous over the woods but this day God
[1:42:42] wanted somebody that would stand how do
[1:42:44] you know that God cared we're going in a
[1:42:46] little bit how do you know that God care
[1:42:49] you Saturday night service to look
[1:42:51] better do you maybe before we're done
[1:42:52] with this one but that's not my purpose
[1:42:55] that's not what I'm trying to do I
[1:42:57] promise you that God had a plan how do
[1:43:02] we know that God cared nobody else cared
[1:43:06] except Shama
[1:43:07] nobody else valued by being filled
[1:43:10] but Shama
[1:43:11] how do we know God cared cause the Bible
[1:43:14] tells us that God cared
[1:43:18] Schama can sit I'll read getting less
[1:43:21] trouble and get through faster he
[1:43:23] considered his options and their
[1:43:25] consequences and then Shama decided to
[1:43:29] stand stand stand stand one question
[1:43:34] what's the hardest part of winning a
[1:43:36] battle like that having the courage to
[1:43:38] take your stand in the middle of a field
[1:43:42] when you feel like a sitting duck when
[1:43:46] you know the enemy doesn't even have to
[1:43:48] strain to see where to shoot his arrow
[1:43:50] because you're just out in the middle of
[1:43:52] a field standing there like a Morning
[1:43:53] Glory how did he stand how did he find
[1:44:00] courage to stand how did he master what
[1:44:04] was necessary to stand when everybody
[1:44:07] left him alone the answer is having the
[1:44:14] courage to take your stand in the middle
[1:44:15] of a field if you can do that the rest
[1:44:16] is easy the hard part of this battle was
[1:44:18] not running away the hard part of this
[1:44:21] battle is not running away uh-huh
[1:44:24] shake your neighbor wake up wake up wake
[1:44:26] up wake up wake up you got all evening
[1:44:28] to sleep
[1:44:29] you should have drank another cup of
[1:44:31] coffee before you came you need stronger
[1:44:34] coffee to get you through boring sermons
[1:44:36] come on you can drink enough to stay
[1:44:37] awake
[1:44:38] help me now but thank you that's so
[1:44:43] sweet I'm concerned about all the rest
[1:44:48] of you I'm not just preaching for one or
[1:44:51] two I'm not just preaching for older
[1:44:53] folks I'm preaching at younger folks too
[1:44:56] I'm preaching to everybody who will hear
[1:44:59] I'm preaching to those on the stream I'm
[1:45:02] preaching to every person that the enemy
[1:45:04] is trying to slowly push you one nudge
[1:45:07] at a time out of your inheritance you
[1:45:13] know when God put this in my heart I was
[1:45:14] sitting there with brother Steve curry
[1:45:16] on my mind and I got up there on a
[1:45:19] Tuesday night and I talked about
[1:45:20] inheritance I talked about how Satan
[1:45:24] wants to
[1:45:25] I talked about the snake that was killed
[1:45:28] up there on the highway and I talked
[1:45:29] about that green worm that I didn't even
[1:45:32] know I'm gonna start calling him olive
[1:45:35] worms all I've ever seen it eat was a
[1:45:39] tomato it blew my mind when I got out of
[1:45:42] the vehicle and saw it on my olive tree
[1:45:45] that brother curry gave me oh you just
[1:45:51] make look I don't have to explain myself
[1:45:54] you ought to know you usually most of
[1:45:57] you believe for the lord long enough to
[1:45:58] know God speaks to you he'll speak
[1:46:01] through your dog if you listen he'll
[1:46:05] talk to you through leaky pipe God will
[1:46:09] use every circumstance to talk to you if
[1:46:11] you listen saw that big old fat juicy
[1:46:13] worm on my olive tree that I've already
[1:46:17] fought to keep alive and on my 50th
[1:46:23] birthday which means something to me
[1:46:26] [Music]
[1:46:29] that's when this was birthed in my heart
[1:46:32] I have an inheritance you have an
[1:46:37] inheritance my kids like burritos I
[1:46:43] don't even know if they do or not I'm
[1:46:45] just preaching he stood in the midst of
[1:46:51] the ground and defended it how did he do
[1:46:56] it Psalm 92 13 those that be planted in
[1:47:00] the house of the Lord shall flourish
[1:47:03] flourish in the courts of our God I'll
[1:47:07] give it to you against you can put it up
[1:47:09] let the people read it Psalm 92 13 those
[1:47:11] that we planted in the house of the Lord
[1:47:13] shall flourish in the courts of our God
[1:47:17] you better plant yourself you better
[1:47:22] plant your feet in the house of the Lord
[1:47:25] and I'm not just talking about church
[1:47:28] I'm talking about in the habitation of
[1:47:31] our God but I'm gonna tell you that
[1:47:33] everything about the bride's life is of
[1:47:36] a paradox it is all of a
[1:47:39] spiritual type and I do believe I do
[1:47:43] believe and you're not going to move me
[1:47:45] from this belief I do believe that you
[1:47:48] are no more faithful to God then you are
[1:47:51] to God's house and I not only have
[1:47:56] scriptures for it I have over 300 quotes
[1:48:00] where brother Branham is telling the
[1:48:02] people there is something wrong with you
[1:48:06] if you don't find yourself in the house
[1:48:11] of God you said well that was at the
[1:48:15] Tabernacle oh no he was out preaching on
[1:48:17] the field he was encouraging people to
[1:48:19] go to their church whether it was
[1:48:20] denominational or whatever it was you
[1:48:22] just got to get somewhere he said to
[1:48:28] brother and sister West waiting nearly
[1:48:30] 10 years on a child when you have
[1:48:32] children get them in a good Sunday
[1:48:34] school somewhere get them under some
[1:48:36] good influence some good training but
[1:48:40] it's bigger than being attached to a
[1:48:42] church it's about being attached to the
[1:48:45] habitation of God play it to your feet
[1:48:48] Shama planted his feet in the house of
[1:48:52] the Lord oh my you're not gonna move me
[1:49:00] my faith refuses to move I'm going to
[1:49:07] have my bean patch instead of you and I
[1:49:11] running from the enemy the Bible tells
[1:49:12] us submit yourselves therefore under God
[1:49:14] in James 4 and 7 resist the devil and
[1:49:16] he'll flee from you resist doesn't mean
[1:49:18] to run resist means to stand against to
[1:49:21] oppose to withstand I'm moving on the
[1:49:27] Bible said he defended it the Hebrew
[1:49:30] verb used here for defend it's spelled
[1:49:33] in a tzs Al and it means to save to
[1:49:37] rescue or to deliver actually the first
[1:49:40] line definition in most lexicons is to
[1:49:42] snatch away he defended the field he was
[1:49:48] snatching away
[1:49:51] the beans they're my beans I laughed
[1:49:58] when I read it like that I could just
[1:50:02] seem you're not getting my beans he's
[1:50:07] holding them in his hand
[1:50:08] just a few minutes before they've been
[1:50:11] harvesting littles and now he's ready
[1:50:15] he's alone he's planted his feet he's
[1:50:19] standing snatching his beans away from
[1:50:22] the enemy slip out if you need to go
[1:50:24] ahead
[1:50:25] I understand Shama boldly removed the
[1:50:32] field from the grasp of the Philistines
[1:50:36] in not getting it
[1:50:39] Jude tells us we must earnestly contend
[1:50:41] for the faith which was once delivered
[1:50:43] to the Saints we've got something worth
[1:50:45] fighting for how many of you believe the
[1:50:47] faith of the Apostles is worth fighting
[1:50:50] for
[1:50:51] how many of you believe Apostolic Faith
[1:50:53] is worth fighting for
[1:50:54] how many of you believe the pure faith
[1:50:56] of the saints is worth fighting for it's
[1:50:58] worth preserving how many of you believe
[1:51:00] holiness it's worth fighting for in a
[1:51:04] world like we're living in today with
[1:51:07] all those green worms out there who
[1:51:09] wanna eat o everything that we love in
[1:51:11] value and treasure come on now it's not
[1:51:13] just about Democrats it's about a lot of
[1:51:16] stuff but devil is after us but he can't
[1:51:20] win because we've planted our feet in
[1:51:22] the promises of God I don't know where
[1:51:26] to I don't know where to stop him I just
[1:51:28] have to stop I don't know how and to be
[1:51:31] continued for for those of you who beer
[1:51:34] to hear the rest but let me just get get
[1:51:37] a little more cuz this is pretty
[1:51:40] interesting to me we have something in
[1:51:42] someone we're fighting for
[1:51:44] you're not just fighting for some thing
[1:51:46] a pot of beans a burrito you're fighting
[1:51:49] for the King of Kings the Lord of lords
[1:51:52] the God of the whole the earth is the
[1:51:54] Lord's and the fullness thereof you're
[1:51:56] fighting for the kingdom of God when you
[1:51:59] stand to watch over your seed because
[1:52:02] you didn't sow them
[1:52:03] to a church you didn't sow them into a
[1:52:06] ministry you sowed your life into the
[1:52:10] kingdom of God you did what you did
[1:52:16] because you loved the Lord you are
[1:52:21] serving mand you are serving him come on
[1:52:26] it's bigger than the beans it's bigger
[1:52:30] than the beans feet bigger than an
[1:52:31] election how many of you know it's true
[1:52:43] we have something to fight for and
[1:52:45] someone to fight for verse 12 said and
[1:52:48] he struck down the Philistines slew is
[1:52:53] the word that's used in the original and
[1:52:55] it's spelled na ha and it means just
[1:52:57] what it says to strike or smite or beat
[1:53:00] or hit until dead
[1:53:05] you said the Bible didn't say kill the
[1:53:07] Philistines it said he struck him down
[1:53:09] oh he struck him down alright
[1:53:14] now if Shama and Shamgar are the same he
[1:53:20] did it with an ox goad but we don't know
[1:53:23] that they're the same the Bible doesn't
[1:53:25] tell us that
[1:53:26] and the Bible doesn't tell us the weapon
[1:53:29] that Shama used I read in commentaries
[1:53:34] where people have told that it was a
[1:53:37] sword because they assumed that the only
[1:53:42] way he could have won such an ultimate
[1:53:44] battle by himself was with a sword
[1:53:47] didn't they read the other stories
[1:53:50] didn't they read what can be
[1:53:51] accomplished with a jawbone of a donkey
[1:53:53] and and a hand of a man of God didn't
[1:53:56] they hear what can happen with an ox
[1:53:57] code brother Ben have said do you know
[1:53:59] what ox code is he said it's a long pole
[1:54:02] with a little sharp metal hook on the
[1:54:04] end of it and he said it's for two
[1:54:06] things it's to knock the mud off the
[1:54:08] plow and the poke for oxen the shoulder
[1:54:10] when you want him to move it ain't much
[1:54:13] it's not a sword
[1:54:16] it's not a machine gun it's something to
[1:54:20] prod the ox or to knock the Madhava
[1:54:23] plough I don't know if it was a sword
[1:54:26] the Bible doesn't say it was a sword
[1:54:28] yeah it could have been a hoe it could
[1:54:36] have been a bag of beans I know he had
[1:54:41] that in his hand wouldn't you like to
[1:54:44] think that a man stood in a field
[1:54:49] because of a heart of dedication and
[1:54:54] faith and and anyone run and that God
[1:54:58] gave him virtue and power and strength
[1:55:01] to knock down every Philistine with a
[1:55:04] bag of beans I hope I don't sound
[1:55:09] disrespectful I don't care if it was
[1:55:11] with an ox ox goad I don't care if it
[1:55:14] was with a sword it doesn't matter to me
[1:55:16] if it was with the tow sack of beans all
[1:55:19] I know is Shama stood and Shama struck
[1:55:25] down the Philistines until they were
[1:55:28] dead let me give you one more thing
[1:55:30] we're getting ready to go this word here
[1:55:36] is a time sense word in the text it is
[1:55:44] framed by a verb that would be labeled
[1:55:48] as imperfect tense this does not mean
[1:55:52] there's anything wrong with the verb but
[1:55:55] an imperfect tense of a verb in Hebrew
[1:55:58] means it is incomplete now that doesn't
[1:56:05] mean that it wasn't perfect the verb and
[1:56:08] it doesn't mean that the job wasn't
[1:56:10] completed but when an imperfect verb
[1:56:14] tense is used in Hebrew it means there
[1:56:18] was some time involved
[1:56:21] it wasn't a split second
[1:56:25] Schama didn't raise his hand his sword
[1:56:28] his beanbag and all the Philistines fall
[1:56:31] dead in the field it was a sweaty mess
[1:56:37] whoo it took some time it took some
[1:56:43] energy it took some sweat but glory be
[1:56:51] to God it was worth the effort praise
[1:56:57] the Lord it took a while but it worked
[1:57:03] I'm gonna close I'll come back to this
[1:57:08] but I want to I want to just give you
[1:57:10] this that won't be here Tuesday night or
[1:57:12] next Sunday or whatever the last part of
[1:57:18] verse 12 I'm closing I should have known
[1:57:25] and the Lord oh Jesus
[1:57:31] it's two o'clock and the Lord brought a
[1:57:38] great victory huh the Lord oh god I
[1:57:46] don't want to fight I don't want to
[1:57:49] fight for a pile of beans just for the
[1:57:56] glory of protecting the beans I want to
[1:58:02] fight in such a way that I have
[1:58:05] cooperated with your purpose and plan
[1:58:08] for those beans those beans were
[1:58:12] predestinated they were chosen beans
[1:58:19] they were going to make somebody a pie
[1:58:21] Shamas wife was going to have a bean pie
[1:58:28] Shamas children we're gonna have
[1:58:31] burritos for dinner
[1:58:35] come on and God was jealous it's bigger
[1:58:40] than the beans but don't you ever think
[1:58:45] that God does not care about the least
[1:58:48] of what you care about we're going
[1:58:53] because he does I do not have the
[1:58:57] affection for animals that some of you
[1:58:58] have but I know that God does I I know
[1:59:04] that he looks at them in a different way
[1:59:06] than I look at them I mean I think
[1:59:08] they're precious I love to see pictures
[1:59:11] of sweet animals I love to see videos I
[1:59:14] don't watch them any cat videos you
[1:59:15] understand why but I love to see I love
[1:59:20] to see video I saw a video this week of
[1:59:22] a little baby moose I think I think me
[1:59:27] Cesare I think they're so ugly they're
[1:59:31] cute and I watched a little clip I saw a
[1:59:36] little clip this weak little baby
[1:59:37] beavers in the in the hutch or whatever
[1:59:41] you call it and and who'd have ever
[1:59:43] thought a baby beaver I must be getting
[1:59:45] old who would have ever thought a baby
[1:59:47] beaver was cute they were so cute but I
[1:59:52] liked them on pictures and in videos
[1:59:54] then you don't have to feed them and
[1:59:56] take care of them but God cares about
[1:59:59] them and even if God didn't care about
[2:00:02] him because he created them he would
[2:00:04] care about them because you care about
[2:00:07] them see if I like Chinese food God
[2:00:14] cares about that he cares about
[2:00:18] everything that I care about that's how
[2:00:22] much he loves me
[2:00:22] come on those beans had a purpose the
[2:00:27] timing of that had a purpose that land
[2:00:31] that that heritage that inheritance had
[2:00:35] a purpose and Shama wasn't just being
[2:00:39] you know a renegade he was planting
[2:00:43] himself in the purpose of the Lord and
[2:00:46] in order to do that he had to see beyond
[2:00:48] the beans and
[2:00:49] - see this is a promise from God now go
[2:00:52] way back and we'll give you a land I'm
[2:00:54] gonna give you the inhabitants of the
[2:00:55] land you're gonna run them out I'm gonna
[2:00:57] give you the fruit of the land we'll
[2:00:58] give you the harvest of the land I'm
[2:00:59] gonna do this and that the other and
[2:01:00] here the Philistines this was part of a
[2:01:04] promise and God allowed Shama to look
[2:01:08] above the beans and above his hungry
[2:01:11] children and see a purpose and a plan
[2:01:13] and a destiny that God had in his mind
[2:01:15] before the foundation of the world can
[2:01:17] we stand and God God in Shama hear me
[2:01:22] God got in him I don't know if it was a
[2:01:28] sword I don't know if it was an ox Gold
[2:01:30] I don't know if it was a sack of beans
[2:01:31] but all I know is he knocked every one
[2:01:34] of those Philistines down knocked them
[2:01:36] until they were dead and the Lord say
[2:01:40] that with me and the Lord brought a
[2:01:45] great victory why because God put
[2:01:51] himself in the hands of a man God put
[2:01:57] himself in the hands of a man God found
[2:02:01] a man that would cooperate with his
[2:02:03] purpose and plan God found a man that
[2:02:06] valued what he valued come on now God
[2:02:10] found a man that was willing to fight
[2:02:13] instead of flee to stand on truth this
[2:02:23] is not something you do in a closet
[2:02:26] there's a time for that there's a time
[2:02:28] for personal commitment there's a time
[2:02:30] for quiet devotion there's a time to
[2:02:34] recommit and rededicate our lives to the
[2:02:36] Lord and the privacy of our door with
[2:02:39] the door closed in the privacy of our
[2:02:41] prayer closet but I want you to know
[2:02:44] there was no time to go hide in a prayer
[2:02:46] closet this was a battle that had to be
[2:02:48] won in in in in the eyes of of all those
[2:02:53] scaredy-cat allies this was a battle
[2:02:57] that had to be it won in the eyes of all
[2:02:59] the enemy come on now
[2:03:02] this was serious business and what you
[2:03:05] are fighting for the seed that you have
[2:03:07] sown is serious business come on how
[2:03:12] many of you have sown you've just you
[2:03:13] just you don't we're not gonna classify
[2:03:15] and clarify we're just gonna say how
[2:03:17] many of know you've sown seed that you
[2:03:19] haven't reaped from yet every one of us
[2:03:21] every one of us
[2:03:23] I mean we've reap we've been blessed God
[2:03:26] has helped us all along but I know there
[2:03:29] are things I know there seed that have
[2:03:32] gone into the ground that I have not yet
[2:03:34] seen the fruit of I cannot abandon my
[2:03:37] seed now I've got to stand in war
[2:03:40] against every wall of the enemy if
[2:03:42] that's what it takes so that God can get
[2:03:44] in my hands God can get in my shoe
[2:03:47] leather and win the battle one man in
[2:03:51] God we used to sing one man and God can
[2:03:53] triumph for a thousand one man in God
[2:03:56] puts Satan on the run so don't be weary

[2:04:04] can win the victory how many of you
[2:04:07] believe God will fight for you if you

[2:04:15] sister Laura come to the music and any
[2:04:17] of the rest of you for just a moment I
[2:04:23] know you think we're the only church in
[2:04:26] the world where the preacher preaches
[2:04:28] two plus hours you're so wrong I was
[2:04:37] listening to a sermon this week from a
[2:04:39] message church in the United States and
[2:04:42] I was listening to it most of the day
[2:04:44] while I was working and doing some other
[2:04:46] things
[2:04:47] Benjamin come in he says he still
[2:04:48] preaching I said he's still preaching
[2:04:50] same service same service same sermon I
[2:04:53] said so son you need to know I'm not I'm
[2:04:55] not the only one but I can't help it if
[2:04:59] I feel like I've got something to say if
[2:05:02] I can find two or three people who want
[2:05:04] to hear it I want you to fight I want
[2:05:09] you to fight you may be too tired to
[2:05:12] fight right now but I want you to fight
[2:05:13] I want you to stand
[2:05:15] for what God has has given you and what
[2:05:18] he has called you to and I want you not
[2:05:21] to be defeated not run but to take
[2:05:24] courage and let God get in your hand
[2:05:28] don't abandon your seat children don't
[2:05:30] do it don't allow the enemy to let you
[2:05:33] do it
[2:05:34] to force you to do it or pull you a way
[2:05:37] to do it father we thank you this
[2:05:38] morning
[2:05:39] you are God's sovereign you are God's
[2:05:44] supreme you are holy and wonderful and
[2:05:48] righteous and faithful and and good in
[2:05:52] all of your ways you have not left us
[2:05:56] alone in Satan's Eden but you have
[2:05:59] filled us with a holy seed an
[2:06:02] incorruptible word that can only produce
[2:06:06] the life of God it cannot feed the flesh
[2:06:10] but it feeds the spirit Oh God every day
[2:06:15] of our lives as we allow that word to
[2:06:19] penetrate us we are being made and
[2:06:22] conformed and re remade into the image
[2:06:25] of the one who sends that word in the
[2:06:28] beginning because we have the promise of
[2:06:31] an eternity with you Lord ruling and
[2:06:35] reigning over the nations Lord some of
[2:06:39] us struggle to keep our own checkbook in
[2:06:41] order we can hardly imagine a day that
[2:06:43] you would allow us to rule and reign
[2:06:45] with you over the nation's but you have
[2:06:47] called us and not only that you said we
[2:06:49] were judge nations and angels the bride
[2:06:53] has a Dominion and an authority that
[2:06:55] Satan desires to rob to steal one
[2:06:59] handful at a time
[2:07:01] one being at a time but lord I thank you
[2:07:03] that you are jealous over the harvest we
[2:07:07] are not the only ones who have an
[2:07:08] investment in the seed that we have sown
[2:07:11] ultimately every bit of it came from you
[2:07:13] every gift every talent every every
[2:07:16] effort every financial
[2:07:18] seed every bit of our sowing was
[2:07:21] ultimately because you put it in our
[2:07:24] hand
[2:07:25] or you put it in our life you deposit it
[2:07:28] in us so you're jealous over that seed
[2:07:30] and lord I thank you that you're
[2:07:32] standing up in such an hour is this
[2:07:34] calling to find anybody anybody who will
[2:07:39] refuse to allow the enemy to come in and
[2:07:43] fare it away what we have planted what
[2:07:46] we have put our hope in what we have
[2:07:49] trusted you to do so lord I ask you to
[2:07:52] make this a reality this month I wish
[2:07:54] that it could been could have been
[2:07:56] brought in a more dynamic way but I ask
[2:07:59] you Father to burn this in somebody's
[2:08:02] heart when the way gets hard this week
[2:08:06] when that when emotions squeeze us I
[2:08:09] pray Lord that this burning word will
[2:08:12] rise up in somebody and they will say
[2:08:15] not this time devil
[2:08:17] not this time Satan I am NOT going to
[2:08:20] abandon my seed I'm not going to run
[2:08:23] from the field I'm going to stand here
[2:08:25] and defend because I believe the Lord of
[2:08:28] the harvest is coming to give us the
[2:08:30] increase we call for the lord of the
[2:08:39] harvest to come and strengthen us and
[2:08:45] anoint us and inspire us to stand firm
[2:08:50] my god let my feet to ask the Lord right
[2:08:54] now let my feet be planted in the house
[2:08:57] of your habitation in the place of your
[2:09:00] dwelling where your name is I want my
[2:09:03] feet to be planted in the purpose and
[2:09:05] destiny that you have called us to
[2:09:07] hallelujah run if you want to run if you
[2:09:12] will but I came here to stay let some of
[2:09:15] us have a theme like that let's some of
[2:09:18] us carry that in our lives you alone are
[2:09:22] worthy
[2:09:23] even though Shama stood and even though
[2:09:25] Shama struck down the Philistines it was
[2:09:28] you Oh God
[2:09:29] it was you Oh God who won the victory it

[2:09:49] have sewn and sewn and sewn in faith O
[2:09:55] God and the enemy has come
[2:09:58] maybe targeting to steal harvest I pray
[2:10:03] Lord today that you would cause each one
[2:10:07] everyone to have a faith reality check
[2:10:11] that we would value again what we have
[2:10:17] once valued and fight again for what we
[2:10:20] have once laid our lives down for if the
[2:10:22] enemy has moved any of us one inch from
[2:10:25] the truth that brought us out Oh God
[2:10:29] let us every one be found right back dab
[2:10:31] in the middle of everything that is holy
[2:10:34] and everything that is pure and
[2:10:35] everything that is true and everything
[2:10:38] that is virtuous and valuable we need
[2:10:41] your grace O God if there is a spirit of
[2:10:44] compromise that is creeping into our
[2:10:46] life may we raise the sword may we raise
[2:10:49] a weapon of whatever is in our hand and
[2:10:52] refuse to bend or to bow refuse to
[2:10:57] reason with the devil who tabali
