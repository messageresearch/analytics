this service you have needs in your heart and i just want you to signify it by the lifting of your hand and let the lord know you are my helper you are my strength there are needs represented big needs that man doesn't know what to do with but our god he knows how to handle them and we want to take them before the throne of god hurry is especially weak today and he is heading to the pulpit to preach he needs to be remembered to the lord that god would give him strength yes he felt so so uh determined to be at his post of duty sister audrey lewis needs to be remembered to the lord in prayer she had another nerve treatment last week it's left her not well and nekeisha even though we saw her yesterday she's really struggling in her back and we'd like for the lord to touch her sister teresa is fighting an infection she'd been fighting it for several days but it really caught up with her in the night last night she was up most of the night i'd like for the lord to not only heal her but to heal the root cause because she deals with those infections very regularly and they can be serious i'd like to see the lord do something for her i think that was all the spoken request i had all right i know that my wife's sister needs a touch from the lord and also the wife of my dad's song leader fell with a heart attack in a grocery store yesterday and was administered cpr the the lady that did the cpr said she lost her twice but she is now in the hospital i believe in kingsport tennessee in the heart hospital there would you remember sister norma asher to the lord she needs the touch of god in her life the whole family let's go to prayer today take these needs to the lord the one who is able to do more than we could ever think or imagine our father as we approach you today our hearts are grateful and thankful because you are moving in our lives and you are drawing us oh god and as we do sometimes face the fire and sometimes it seems like it's never going to let up but we realize god that this is working a beautiful work in the life of a believer it is more than we can even comprehend sometimes what this fire is doing in our lives and so we just say thank you lord that you have a perfect work for our lives and that you're bringing about uh not a a a new image that is just another person but you are bringing about the image of the lord jesus christ into the earth and lord that is what we long for we we're we're tired of of of ourselves being on display we want to see the living lord jesus on display in the earth so god we welcome you to work in our lives and do as you want to god when we draw back and we resist we ask you that you will tenderly by the voice of the holy spirit remind us that this is a work of the holy ghost that you're doing in us now god as we bring before you the needs of the people you saw the hands all over this building and you even see that the needs that are represented on the streaming those that are watching this service on different platforms today lord we're praying for each one of these needs you see desperation people who are desperate this morning for a move of god in their lives they feel dried up and withered up and they feel like that they can't go on but oh may the presence of the living god reach to them this day by the power that comes from on high oh lord let there be such a move of the spirit in our lives that all of that dryness would just disappear and we would feel the river of god flowing through our being this day you see sicknesses and ailments and diseases lord that they are many and then they're uh in the lives of the believers and god we're praying right now that you the healer would manifest your healing virtue in these situations god as our brother steve curry would go to the pulpit today to minister the word of god our fellow brother and minister we're asking god that you would let a special anointing come upon him that all of the weakness that he might have felt as he got there that it would just fall away lord and he would have such strength to deliver an on-time word to those people i pray god that you will continue to strengthen him and and fill him up oh lord with your sweet presence god as we're here in this place today we've come we thank you for your presence that is among us we ask you to do what you desire to do let the angels be in their places we invite them in lord may there not be one missing that has been ordained for this service today god may there be a clear channel that we can hear the word of the lord for us today we don't want to miss what you want

jesus save your friend and i know that thou art with me will be with me to the end jesus jesus how i trust him for grace grace to trust him more would you give the lord jesus a hand clap of praise hallelujah you may be seated another moment i know you've been standing nearly an hour i want to give you a few minutes of a break and then we'll stand for the reading of the word and then you get to sit some more maybe it doesn't bother you but it bothers some people to stand that long and uh we want you to be able to focus here from the lord today because we believe he's here i don't know about you but i was so thankful when i walked out on the platform yesterday came up there's always the formality of the wedding and always in the back of your mind you're saying lord please don't let me forget please don't let me forget anything during the rehearsal we were trying to get the parents and grandparents in so that you know bring them in and let the ushers practice bringing them in and all of a sudden i looked up and i said well where's brother billy he's got to get in here and they said no no said he's bringing him the bride and so i embarrassed myself real good so when you when you come out to do a wedding or graduation or funeral or something like that that's not an ordinary service you're always having that in the back of your mind lord don't let me ruin their video don't let me ruin their memory let it be as special as possible and i chew my lozenger real quick before i come out so i don't spit it out while i'm talking and you just go through all these things you make sure that everything is zipped and buttoned and everything's in place the best it can be and brother greeley he knows and uh when i walked out here yesterday and we had an eclectic group of people here you can choose your friends but you don't choose your family they're just yours you just get them and they're not all going to be alike they're not all going to have normal hair they're going to be different they're it's just like a collection you just collect them and love them and accept them but i walked out here yesterday and by the time i got up on the platform i said of course david was facing this way and we're getting ready to the bridesmaids and whatever coming in i said i feel him he's here his presence already was so tangible for me that it just soothed everything it just soothed all that and i went once you know he's there why it wouldn't matter if you spit your lozenger out it wouldn't matter it wouldn't matter once his presence is there it wouldn't really matter at the end and he just got richer and richer as we went on and several people made the comment after it was over how the holy ghost came and said amen that was his amen over our service yesterday and the joining together of ashley and david and there were people here who had never been to anything like that and there the families that were represented have just recently had 10 minute wedding services there was a couple here yesterday just married a couple weeks and their wedding i know it was special to them and i know that it's just as legal and holy before god but it was 12 12 or 13 minutes and it's over and we don't uh we don't try that we want it to be everything that it can be you get one chance at it that's your chance and you want to make it holy and you want it to be presented in a way that it's not it's not loose it's not casual now after people see all the work and the effort that goes into it they said well i think i'll just elope and this is my answer to you christians don't elope that's my answer you don't have to say amen o me or nothing that's not the way of christ now you can do that and still be a child of god but that's not the christian way the christian way is to express those vows in the presence of god in the house of god with the saints of god not that god doesn't hear what you say privately or when you run away or do things like that but it should be a solemn moment and it should be celebrated as a solemn moment and yet there was such joy you're mighty quiet and i'm not nervous yet there was such joy in the room and there were those from other faiths there was a pastor's wife here there were those from other faith and even some who were serving like the photographers in different ones somebody said a couple people said that's the kind of wedding i want i want something that has some feeling to it and uh one young lady who had been very solemn i thought during the whole process and a little uncomfortable maybe not a part of the community but a very fine young lady but the presence of the lord came she didn't know what to call it she said i'm not an emotional person you probably could see that about me is what she said to me directly i'm not an emotional person she said i'm the one that holds it together for everybody else but she said i couldn't hold the tears back something happened to me that's what we want it's an opportunity to make an impact on somebody else's life so we want to continue to pray for david and ashley as they leave this area today and and head all the way to where they're going on their honeymoon several hours away and pray that god will just bless them and uh encourage their hearts and that they will really see the fulfillment of what the presence of god was doing yesterday making them one so that they can face their future we have another wedding coming up two weeks from yesterday we're already praying that god's presence will be real in that wedding as well and that it will just be beautiful everything yesterday was beautiful the food was delicious the the setting of the reception was perfection and all the hard work that went into it i know this couple appreciates it very much what their families did and what their church family did i know there was a lot of grace around the room i don't know if you were affected by what grandpa barr said but i was affected by that i was affected by that and i talked to him after the reception we were standing around we didn't think we could ever we honestly didn't think david and ashley would ever leave and finally we just said please leave you know get out of here and uh because we wanted to go home and they did finally leave uh we didn't get home till nine o'clock i think a little after nine so they had just left in fact they passed us they made a stop and passed us and honked their horn rolled the window down and waved as they were going out right out about the intersection of 379. but i was talking to grandpa bar about it and he said i've never told as far as i know i've never told another soul about that except teresa he said david heard it today for the first time he said i don't know if i could say that i've ever really heard from god ever since then like that but i know that is one time that prayer changed things and he was emotional and he said i almost didn't share it preacher he said i thought well no i haven't said it to them but to get up and tell the whole crowd i don't know if i can do it or not and he said this thought came to me i don't want to take that to my grave that's pretty serious business i appreciate it i said i i celebrate the fact that you did that and i said if jesus tarries david needs to be able to testify of that to his children and if it would have if it would have died with you he might not have had the opportunity to share it with his children and the minute i said that the inspiration from scripture came tell your children and their children's children tell them generation to generation what god did their lives would look a lot different david's life would look a lot different if in fact he would have been born with either one of those conditions somebody said we have no way of knowing whether that was true whether he really had that or whether that was just a premonition that wasn't i don't even care it doesn't even matter to me what matters to me is god was glorified in it grandpa's bar grandpa bars faith was strengthened in it and so was mine by sharing it and since i know that god can do that i have no problem believing that he did oh hallelujah somebody said what is that that's faith that's what faith looks like you know i don't know whether god's going to save us out of this fiery furnace or not we don't know what his plan is we may go down today but we're going to go down in his presence we're going to go down knowing the fourth man's with us and everything's gonna be all right that's what faith does faith answers the challenge doesn't it so let me just get this out of the way real quick uh next sunday is the first sunday right and so brother greeley will be lifting receiving the offering toward the principal and as of this morning we have raised one hundred and twelve thousand and twenty eight dollars and 80 cent all by the grace of god can we give god thanks for that [Applause] i want to welcome all of you

angela almost you and angela almost shared today didn't you you were pretty close and sister jeffrey's birthday is on friday as well can we say happy birthday to both of those dear sisters can we stand together you ready for the word if you're not is coming anyway it's on the way i'd like for you to turn first to genesis chapter 2 verse 7. we want to say thank you to the musicians appreciate what you've done [Music] i today your help yesterday as well genesis chapter 2 verse 7 then i want to read luke chapter 1 verse 35 genesis chapter 2 verse 7 said and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life the breath of life and man became a living soul adam received spirit life from the very breath of god which is the breath of life that body made from the earth adam from adamah that body made from the red dirt that's what it means god breathed into that when i see that in my mind i see it just like mouth-to-mouth resuscitation i see the very lips of god positioned over adam breathing exhaling his breath of life which is spirit the life of god is spirit not natural life but spirit life and in that moment adam became a tripartite man didn't he are you with me body spirit soul spirit soul body all three dynamics of man represented in that original creation adam i'm going to read it again in the lord god formed a man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul now let's read luke chapter one you might recognize this already verse 35 and the angel said unto her let me just tell you this is gabriel speaking to mary or miriam the holy ghost shall come upon thee [Music] and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god i want to read it just like that again and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god father we need your help today our bodies are tired we had a big day of celebration yesterday and a lot of preparation leading up to that it's left a lot of people's bodies a little worn but we need your presence we need this service today we need your word because it's more important to our existence than the lunch that we will have this afternoon we need the living word of god it gives us strength it sustains us in a world of spiritual famine this famine of hearing the word of god it must take preeminence in the life of the believer and it's not punishment but rather it's life to us so may we feed upon that word would you anoint your servant to declare it would you anoint your servant's ears to hear it and would you receive the glory when the last amen is said we ask this in the name of the lord jesus christ for his glory and the saints said you may be seated again we started reading of adam that freshly fashioned formed man of dust man of the red earth and he was only a body just a form no life in him whatsoever although he had been created by the very fingertips of god he was still an empty shell until he was filled with the breath of life and the breath of god the breath of god's life is spirit brother branham told us many times the contrast of dynamics and mechanics he said you can have all the mechanics you can have it all chrome plated shined up you can have the most clean beautiful engine that's ever been built by man but without the dynamic it can have chrome plated steering wheel and wheels on the tires and oh my he would go on some time to describe a real hot rod you might say but it's no more than just an old hunk of metal unless there's a spark in there to cause that car to do what it was designed that engine to do what it was designed to do and that's run there is the there is this expectation that there will be a combustion that takes place a spark that ignites a starter that starts a carburetor that carburetes uh on and on and on you can tell already i'm not a mechanic but the goal is to propel the vehicle forward to create something that you can get in and it's a little higher up than the buggy in the wagon day you know horse and buggy horse and wagon day little higher advance in transportation and it takes that holy ghost spark it takes the holy ghost dynamics to fall on the mechanics to cause the believer to be fit for service you and i are just a hunk of junk until he breathes his breath of life in us by the power of the holy ghost we can have a good pedigree we can be raised in the finest home and we can have all the the comforts of home and a good mother and a good father and lots of love and and uh whatever else but we're just normal ordinary people just empty vessels until the holy ghost comes and breathes breathes the breath of life into us if you understand the simplicity of what i'm saying would you just say amen then we skipped over to luke and we read about the angel's visitation to mary this young virgin jewish believing girl perhaps as the prophet told us she was one of those who had heard of the prophecy of isaiah that a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a child brother branham said for generations after isaiah's prophecy young little girls would knit booties and prepare their home hear me what i'm saying now prepare their home and their life in case just in case they might would be the one that would carry the messiah in their womb you know what that is that's what we were talking about just a few minutes ago it's called faith it's called faith that identifies yourself with the word of promise you've not just got to have faith you've got to be able to take a promise a particular promise and put your faith in that promise and say that's not just for all mankind but that is for me as an individual that is my promise and if god can do it for anybody he can do it for me why would he because he loves you and has loved you from before the foundation of the world you're his and he's not going to lose you and as we talked about here tuesday night he has separated you from your sin as far as the east is from the west you'll never ever encounter your sin again not that sin that sin has been dealt with by the precious blood of jesus christ how many of you know it's right and this example that we talked about you can start traveling north and go all the way to the north pole and when you pass the north pole you're no longer traveling north you're traveling south because we know exactly where north begins we know exactly where south begins so it doesn't matter what it looks like on on a globe what matters is the fact is you've now passed the pole of north so now you're moving south but there is no distinguishing point where east begins or where west begins and so the rider was wise to choose the analogy to be so far separated from our sin as far as the east is from the west because that means you could chase it some people go chasing after it to see if it's still there i want you to know it's not there if you've repented of your sin if the blood of jesus christ has been applied it's not just covered up it's absolutely as though it never happened in the first place it's greater than just a remi just a covering it's a remission remission it's a remitting of sin god is so good today i want to begin a little uh series on the seven offices of the holy ghost now let me tell you that i don't know that offices is the perfect word maybe when we're finished with this little study the next few services you will have come up with a better word and i'll use it because i don't say that office is the greatest word maybe administration seven administrations maybe even the word executions i considered all three but at the end of this it's not to have the perfect word to describe these ministries of the holy spirit in our life but it is to be able to recognize them and cooperate with them when they work in us now let me from the outset let me say i'm not talking about isaiah 11. i'm not talking about what isaiah calls the seven spirits of god i'm not talking about the seven eyes of the lamb i'm not talking about the seven stars or the seven burning lamps before the throne i'm not talking about the seven-fold spirit of god that we read about in isaiah i'm talking about seven ministries or seven offices seven administrations seven executions that are given to us in the scripture of how the holy ghost works in our lives are you awake i don't know exactly how to explain it in a way that i could introduce it and you would just jump on board and follow me all the way through this but i can tell you that god's been talking to me about this a long time now and if i had to choose an analogy that might help you to understand where we're going to go in the next few services i'm only going to speak of one of those offices today i would say it's something like the comprehensive authority structure of the presidency of the united states of america i know this is a uh a subject that we don't even want to think about right now but we have to we have to think about it because it's an office that is supposed to speak to us of strength go ahead say amen strength power authority the highest office in the land in order for someone to be able to carry out that office they need to be sound sound mind sound body oh my not ignoring reality not ignoring what's going on at the border not turning a blind eye it's not i want to just say this i just gotta say this strike it from the record if you must i want you to know that southern border of the united states should never ever be considered the new ellis island who's ever heard of such an analogy as that i think a preschooler could understand the difference between coming to this country legally like all of our parents did gran i don't know how far back but somewhere in your family line unless you're 100 native american your your family were immigrants to this country can you say man they came legally if they got here and stayed most likely and ellis island was there to make sure that people came in the legal way the right way so to compare what's going on on our southern border with ellis island it's it's sic it's really sick it's sad it speaks of the condition of our nation enough of that but no apology made the president of the united states is he has a huge job it's huge wouldn't matter if it was a man or a woman it's a huge job to do he's the he's the chief executive of the nation amen he's the chief administrator of the nation he is the chief diplomat some people would call him the face of the nation is that right we don't have a prime minister the president is the highest representation of our nation that exists he is the one ultimately responsible for the welfare of this nation should our country go to war he serves as commander-in-chief of the nation's armed forces i want you to know that job right there is big enough to overwhelm anybody he's commander-in-chief of the army and the navy and the air force and the marines there are many underneath him who administer that authority on a ground level but he is the ultimate authority he's the one who carries the suitcase with the nuclear code he's the one who has the authority to do that don't don't don't think on that long don't think on that long and i'm so thankful to know there are a few checks and balances in place to make sure that someone unstable doesn't just blow up another nation and cause us to be blowed up in response anybody listening i'm telling you it's a big but only one man can be the president of the united states at the same time or one woman at one time but they are responsible to where every one of those hats at any given time come on now a vice president serves at the pleasure of the president they can be assigned to specific tasks and it can be as simple as laying a wreath on a grave it can be as serious as being made a czar of a certain administration of the government like our vice president has been put in charge of the situation at the southern border but ultimately the responsibility does not fall on her head it falls on the president's head he's one man and every one of those jobs would you call them offices would you call them executions of his office would you call them administrations of his responsibility i don't know what you would call them but i want you to understand as you look this way i want you to understand that i'm talking about one man one person with many important jobs to execute and so when i say the seven offices of the holy spirit i want you to hear it in the way that i'm presenting it i'm not saying i have the definitive list and i'm not saying that office is the best word to use but i'm saying that the holy ghost is more than a chill he's more than a thrill he's more than an unknown tongue he's more than a feeling he has a lot of responsibilities and he desires to execute all of those responsibilities in our life to the glory of god are you with me on that so when the holy ghost came and the angel spoke to mary and said to her the holy ghost shall come upon thee that's all that he is all that the holy ghost is shall come upon thee and the power of the highest or the most high shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god now this message came by an angel who was dispatched by the father is that correct it's the father's responsibility to dispatch angels on certain missions with certain responsibilities to carry out are you with me i'm going to keep checking on you now because i don't want you to miss where we're going it's the father's responsibility to do that so that so we could say that it was the father who sent gabriel the angel of the lord to speak to mary and to talk to her about what was about to take place and he said the holy ghost is going to come on you the power of the highest is going to overshadow thee this is a consummation taking place there is a seed that is being placed in the womb of a virgin mary that is not deposited there by a man it's being deposited there by the holy ghost under the dispatch of the father the father is sending the holy ghost to overshadow mary to plant a seed now the prophet taught us and i believe it is true that not only did god provide the the seed he also provided the egg or the ovum he placed that in her womb so that it there would be no room for the natural aspect of the flesh this is a holy thing and because the mother is the one uh you know we we understand about the blood and how the blood comes and there is some dispute about how that happens but let me say that god was covering all the bases there was no room for error in the body of the lord jesus he created the womb he created the egg he created the seed the sperma that would fertilize would consummate by the spirit not by a natural act of intimacy and the life the holy thing that was formed as a result of that overshadowing and the holy ghost coming upon mary that holy thing would forever be called the son of god now we don't have time to reestablish the fact that god is not a trinity but he never has been and he never will be and there's no scripture that says anything like a trinity it is absolutely a creation of the catholic church and it has been used to cause people to misunderstand who god is down through the ages and those who opposed the lie of rome were killed if they got too vocal they were just killed i don't know what to think about a church that just kills off their enemies but the catholic church considered every enemy of the church an enemy of god and they had no problem physically taking their lives and that's why the blood of tens of thousands of martyrs are crying out in the book of revelation crying out because they were not murdered by murderers and by those who had no uh knowledge of faith but murdered by their own church serious business isn't it so because we understand a little bit about how the godhead functions we understand that if mary was overshadowed by the holy ghost the power of the highest overshadowed her and provided the seed that germinated the egg and caused life to come forth then if we believed it in a trinitarian fashion we would have to say jesus was born with two fathers the father because remember the essence of the trinitarian doctrine is that god is three persons and if you've got two persons as a father of the same son something's a little odd even though the world tries to cram that down our throats it's just not the way it works so we know that that this father is an office of god and the holy ghost is an office of god an administration of god whatever however you find comfort in describing it but of the same essence of the same spirit one spirit one holy spirit overshadowed mary and that which was born in her womb was of the spirit yet it had a physical body as john 1 1 and john 1 14 tell us in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word became flesh powerful truth the foundation of our faith it's what we stand on today but in the holy ghost there are also administrations and offices ministries executions however you would want to describe it those are mentioned in the bible and we're going to begin a little bit of a study on that because i believe the lord will speak to you before it's over and help you to understand that you have more help than you realize to make this thing i'm telling you he lives in you by the power of the holy ghost and he has so many purposes so many offices so many executions so many administrations he has so much purpose in your life to do so many things for you that all you and i have to do is yield ourselves to the person to the life of jesus christ that's in us and allow him to live his life out his life is to be an overflow it's to come and fill and then flow over flow out of our lives to minister to others we pray so in the same way the president is one man with all kinds of different offices chief administrator chief executive chief diplomat commander-in-chief he goes on and on and on and on just one man with all these different responsibilities the holy ghost is just one spirit the father and the holy ghost are the same spirit the spirit that lives in the body of jesus christ is the same spirit as the father he is the same spirit as the holy ghost these are different offices of god and we know that they work together because they are one and yet they are different in the sense that they have different responsibilities they have different ministries they operate in different ways all to the glory of the same god if you're with me say man if you're asleep say amen i believe if we should take these offices seven of them and start going through the different references of what the holy spirit does in our life we would find at least 66 and i think i may could find uh 70. at least 66 maybe even 70 different services that the holy ghost carries out in our life whoa he's busy he's busy because he operates in you in at least seven offices and at least 66 specific services mentioned in the scripture there is more sad about the spirit of god and the holy ghost of god than about the father and the son put together interesting isn't it because getting god in you god giving in you was his purpose from the beginning he didn't just want to live above you he didn't just want to walk through life by your side he wanted to crawl inside of you by the power of his spirit and give you what you need to make it be over let me tell you how you're going to overcome you're going to overcome because the overcomer lives inside of you and as you learn him and learn to lean on him and learn to cooperate with him you'll find out this is not to make you lazy but you'll find out you're striving in the flesh way too hard there is a more effective way to strive all striving is not sin according to the bible there are there's a right way to strive and there's a wrong way to strive it's never right to strive in the flesh it's never right to strive in the mind in the will or in the emotions which make up the realm of the soul all real striving comes from an inspiration in the spirit a re-generated spirit that lives inside of you the holy spirit joining with your spirit to regenerate it to make it alive you have had a rebirth you have had a resurrection in your fallen human spirit and now that human spirit has been overshadowed it has been swallowed up in the gift of his holy spirit that now lives inside of you remember he wasn't satisfied to be over your head he wasn't satisfied to be at your elbow he wanted to live inside of you to the glory of god if you believe that same man i'm working a little hard and i'm going to do it i'm going to do it i'm going to keep on [Music] now of these seven divine offices i'm going to keep saying administrations executions whatever word you need maybe by the end of it we'll be so uh settled on the word we just say it of these seven divine offices of the holy spirit that we can find in the new testament the first four of them and you'll recognize them you'll recognize them you who are just looking at me like i don't know where and where you're going you'll recognize them in a minute if you're a student of the bible at all you'll recognize them in a moment the first four of those seven offices reveal the work of the holy spirit in creating the divine life of christ in the believer i want to say that again those first four divine offices of the holy spirit they administrate their job their their work their ministry in you is in creating the divine life of god in us did you know the divine life of god is in you let me ask you that did you know that's what the baptism of the holy ghost is did you know it's like what happened to adam god breathing in your nostrils the breath of spirit the breath of life did you know we could also say the breath of light because light life and spirit in the bible has the same ministry it accomplishes the same thing are you with me i don't mean to keep saying that but if i felt like you were i wouldn't ask first john chapter 5 we're almost off of page 1. first john chapter 5 verse 11 and 12. and this is the record that god hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his son listen again and this is the record that god hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his son he that hath the son hath life i thought the spirit is what brings us life it is don't you understand that the sun was filled with the spirit don't you remember we've said it thousands of times brother branham maybe hundreds of times all that the father was he poured and emptied into the sun and all that the sun was he emptied into the church oh brother don't let that be old news to you that's the best news i have to share with you you don't have to lose you don't have to go down in defeat you don't have to slide back you don't have to live in depression or grief you do not have to live there because greater is he that lives on the inside of you which is the life of the son what lives in you by the holy ghost the life of the son the life of the father same life same spirit what's it called in greek zoe it's the same life it's the same spirit and i want you to know there's no defeat in christ there's no molly grubs in him we fight them we fight them because we live with a divided mind but if we can live with a single vision if we can live with a single eye if we can live with a single mind we'll walk in the victory that lives inside of us now when you preach like that you've got all these people making all of their pleas making sure that everybody understands the circumstances of their life and how difficult they are so you don't need me preaching that you're gonna do that on social media you're going to do that when you talk to one another after church you're going to do that over coffee oh i'm really going through something these days you don't need me to preach that to you it's your reality you live it and whether you admit it or not you want to share it there's no doubt in my mind none whatsoever because i've been fighting this same battle that you fight ever since i received the baptism of the holy ghost the enemy wanted to destroy me with depression just like he wants to destroy you we're not always up but we're never defeated come on now we're not always dancing in the victory but we always have the life of the sun and that's what you need to hear that's what you need to be reminded of you don't really need me to pet you in your place you need me to remind you that god has paid an ultimate price and if we choose to live in that how is it better to be a believer if a nerve peel can fix it we don't need the holy ghost come on if if if counseling can help it we don't really need listen everybody fights everybody has a battle you don't need to be reminded of mine and i don't need to be always reminded of yours but what we do need to do is speak to one another in faith and speak to one another by the spirit and speak to one another by the word of god and remind each other that we are we are i don't mean to say it quite like this but we are better we are living a higher life we're not even of that old race why do you want to spend so much time associating yourself with adam's fallen race when you are born of the spirit and now you are a part of the royal seed of abraham tell the devil he's a liar tell the devil he's defeated in your life tell the devil he's lost the battle for you the overcomer lives in you the holy ghost is in you with all of his offices with all of his administrations with all of his executions he is there to overcome for you in you so that you can have victory there is a victory there is a victory in serving jesus christ there is a victory it's what gives a mother the grace to bury her child it's what gives a wife the grace to bury her husband knowing that there is a victory there is an overcomer there is a resurrection that lives inside of us it's a temporary goodbye come on now i know some folks that are going through it really in the heat of the pain and the grief that goes with loss and i know some that are overcoming because and i pray all will but they can't all can't all can't overcome that way because it's only when you have the holy ghost in you that you have the overcoming power and it's only when you learn to cooperate with him i mean fully participate with him in your strength whoo you know for some of us if we should lose our complaints we would lose our personality because we have developed an identity and a personality around our aches and pains around our shortnesses in life around our wounds our hurts and what we've experienced and if god should break through i feel him now if god should break through in us and bust us out of that prison we'd be new people we would be new people we would lose the need to tell somebody and we would have rather a testimony that glorifies christ and says you can't make it on your own but because the overcomer is in you whoa you can make it this is the record that god hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his son he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the son of god hath not life so the first four of the seven offices or administrations of the holy spirit in our life work to create the very divine life of god in us we receive a deposit of that in the new birth we receive an immersion in that divine life by the baptism of the holy ghost but there is a developing process that takes place in us and i have been baptized with the holy ghost since i was seven years old i'm now 53 years old you do the math he has been working in my life and i want you to know i am still so far so far from letting him have total sway i'm not bragging i'm telling you the bitter reality but here's where my hope is he didn't leave me when i failed to yield a certain part of who i am to him he said i'll just be patient hallelujah praise god you may not have any patience with me i may not have any patience with you but the holy ghost hallelujah he has patience with the believer he does he knows the battle he knows the battle he recognizes the struggle he knows that when you strive in the flesh and in the soul you are absolutely wearing yourself out but when you learn to pull in the spirit and push in the spirit did you know that in the spirit there's pulling and pushing yes so you you just worship your way i mean it better be the bible way and i'll worship my way the bible way and i don't understand all the time sometimes i don't understand why i've done what i've done sometimes i don't understand why my arms move a certain way my voice raises a certain way sound a certain sound come i don't understand it all but i know the work of the holy ghost is never done in my life he just keeps moving and working and in your life the same and oh what i see god doing let me just take a minute lord i want to thank you right now i want to thank you right now for what i know you're doing in the life of every believer every believer that will cooperate with you every believer that will participate with you thank you for having patience with us thank you for letting the holy ghost continue to work in us outward pushing pushing pushing from the inside out the holy ghost of god pushing from the inside out to pull us up into a higher position to make our feet like hein's feet to give us victory when there's no reason to have victory hallelujah to cause us to shout when everybody else thinks we ought to be mourning and weeping and groaning but the holy ghost comes [Music] whoa hallelujah hallelujah and then the other three offices that we'll talk about in the future they reveal the divine power that the holy spirit gives us as he governs our lives the first four work together in us all one holy ghost four different ministries all working together to create in us the life of christ form it in us i travail in birth the apostle said until christ is formed in you christ is being formed you with me christ is being formed in the life of the believer christ is being formed in us it didn't come all at one time his fullness you've got christ in you right now but he's not fully formed we are yielding ourselves and he is forming himself by the holy spirit forming himself in us by the holy spirit so the first four work together to create the divine life of god in us we should say to reproduce it to reproduce the life of christ in us and if we didn't say that reproduce we would say recreate because when you have the holy ghost you've got the life of christ the other three offices are there to govern to govern us how many of you want to thank him for the government of the god the very government of god the government of the holy spirit if he didn't put the governor on me sometime if the holy ghost didn't put the governor on you sometime why don't you listen to me if he didn't govern us sometime it's not been 24 hours since he had to govern me me and brother steve just to us he had to say whoa you ever been clicking along 70 miles an hour and the holy ghost slam on breaks thank you lord thank you holy ghost for putting on the brakes if i mess up like this what would i do if you didn't put your foot on the brake sometime and bring me to a complete halt some of you some of you like me you miss that sometime you override that sometime you get your screwdrivers out and you try to fix it you try to take the governor off because you can't run like you want to run you can't click along like you want to click along but sometimes you need to understand the holy spirit is slowing you down because there is a real cliff up your up the road from where you are right now and if you're clicking along too fast thank you lord for slowing us down when we don't know how to slow ourselves down so the last three offices he are governing the others are creating or recreating the life of christ in us the last three they govern our lives and help develop the character of christ in the believer because even though the life of christ is there it has to be developed and it is developed when we yield you know every time you yield to god you grow did you know every time you yield to him you're growing you are you're growing every time you say yes lord your way i can clearly see my way your way lord is a little sketchy but i'm going to choose your way you see i mean you and i can make a plan for the next three years the holy ghost can say no no and you've got to say yes to something you don't fully understand you've got to say no to something you understand and yes to something you don't understand but as long as you know the voice as long as you know the voice of the holy ghost you can trust him you can trust him you may not like brother like we read here tuesday night brother brahm said you may not be able to you know see perfection in me i may not be able to see perhaps we may not but oh we know whose hands we're in we know who we belong to you may not be able to get above me or i may struggle to get above you we have all kinds of things working against us in this hour and what we have to do is choose his way god help us god help us strengthen us he's the only one the holy ghost is the only one that can bring the believer to maturity and to true holiness i said true holiness that's what comes by the spirit as we learn to yield in obedience to the holy ghost in our lives we become more victorious and we can reign in life as god intended for us to reign we are being trained to reign even now and not just so that we can reign in eternity there's going to be an overcoming people just prior to the rapture of the bride there's going to be a people who operate in the overcoming power of the holy ghost that lives inside of them and christ is going to be fully formed in their lives did you hear me christ is going to be fully formed fully mature in their lives he's there wake up your neighbor he's there but not fully formed it takes life it takes hills and tunnels and valleys and mountains and it takes rejections it takes hurt feelings it takes fire sometimes it takes misunderstandings to put us in a place where we can learn to trust amen because we treat our heavenly father by what we know of our earthly fathers and that hinders us and it can hinder us all of our life if we let it come on now look flesh and blood is going to fail you if you let somebody get too high up on a pedestal in your life god knows how to bring them down he knows how to thump them off of that pedestal either in their own life or in your eyes so that you will learn to put your trust in him i believe that's why we have found some little things in the message of the hour where stories might be told a little different or the details might be a little different and we might that might throw some people off and cause them not to believe anymore but it helps us to look to the one who who we were to be introduced to it helps us to look to jesus we're not looking to eliezer we're looking to our husband come on now and if god if god can use an imperfect uh vessel one generation ago i'm just telling you what he said about himself this is not to reflect on any anyway on brother brown's character because his character had been refined by the fire of god but as i've told you before he did not have the gift of perfect recall and sometimes there would be a little detail missing or one added or something two stories run together and now that people have such access on the internet they come back and say well i guess he was just making it up as he went my my my you mean you can be a human and make all the mistakes you make you mean i can get upset with brother billy for not being out here when the rest of the parents are being seated and then find out he had another job you mean we can make mistakes like this and be okay but not allow somebody else to be human and make mistakes god wants you to see he wants you to see what he can do with imperfect flesh because brother branham unlike jesus christ he did not have a god-given egg and a god-given sperm that made his very birth perfection god jesus christ birth was perfection because mary knew no man brother branham is very quick to tell you how he was born he was born because of a sexual union that took place between charles and elle branham the egg that formed the prophet was that which was formed by the by the body of of elebranum and the sperm that that fertilized that egg and caused a baby to be formed in that womb that was a a deposit from mr charles branham but the vessel that was created was one that god had chosen like yours before the foundation of the world to use in outstanding ways that vessel like your vessel has to be redeemed has to be justified has to be sanctified has to be filled with the holy ghost no one is born in perfection we are all formed to perfection and it's the work of the holy spirit if you're with me say man it's 106. i didn't tell you to stay up till 2 a.m john 14 16 and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever and you know what they say see see there's the trinity see jesus praying to the father to send the holy ghost if that verse was the only verse in the words of jesus in john you might come away with a limp limping understanding like that but you've got to lay it in with everything else he said can you say amen we've already covered that in this study already the last few weeks so this is not three different people praying this is three offices of the one god interacting with one another as they do even now interacting with one another i will pray the father jesus said red letter and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever he's not going to leave us now and when you look at that word another it's very powerful when you look at that word another in the greek it's alos it means another but of the same kind it means another but of the same substance it's marking secession jesus is saying i have been a comfort to you while i was here in the flesh but i'm going to leave and i'm praying the father that he will send you another deposit but of the same kind marking secession meaning you had me now you will have another deposit of me [Music] it will operate in a different way it's not suggesting an entirely different substance but it is rather indicating the next installment numerically your first comfort was jesus your next comfort is going to be the holy ghost who will be an advocate and who will live inside of you oh i wish you could stay awake he lives inside of us number one would you write this down notetakers the first office of the holy spirit that we're going to talk about in this study together is the spirit of life the spirit of life and it is the ministry of the spirit of life i'll show you the bible for it it is the ministry of the spirit of life to create in you god's divine life that is a part of what the holy ghost does in the life of the believer i'm going to take just a few more moments here it's 110. i'll try to let you out a little earlier today because i think if you're getting your nap now you might miss what the lord would say to you and i'd rather uh not just throw this out there and let it fall on the deaf ear but i want to read at least a little bit more number one the spirit of life romans chapter eight verse one and two we just read verse one recently let's look at it again there is therefore now no remember the work of the holy ghost is not to condemn his work is to convict there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh read it for me but after the spirit for the law of the there it is for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus have made me free from the law of sin and death the spirit of life in christ jesus that's one of the offices or administrations or executions of the work of the holy ghost in you he operates in us as the spirit of life now the spirit of life is not a separate spirit it's all by the holy spirit it's just a ministry or an office of the holy spirit but where would you be without the spirit of life for the law of the spirit of life do you remember uh you that are with me do you remember a few weeks ago we we did a quick study on the three kinds of life that are mentioned in the new testament we talked about them we gave scripture for them i won't go over it i i copied it into my notes again but i won't go over it all with you again but remember there were three major words that are translated life in the new testament and they were bios suki and zoe do you remember that at all and bios was the physical body and it's the life of the physical and it's where we get our word biology and the suke that is the psychological life of the human soul that's where we get the word psychology and there are times that that word appears and i i might could just give you one example matthew 16 25 for whosoever will save his life success he shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it that is life of the mind of the emotion of the will and then thirdly when we see the word life in the new testament sometimes more often than not it is the greek word zoe which is a life that is given to us through the lord jesus christ it is a life that is uncreated it is the uncreated eternal life of god it is the divine life possessed by god now do you remember that study we did that just just a few weeks ago a month or two ago i don't remember exactly how long ago it was so now we just read romans 8 1-2 and verse 2 says for the law of the spirit of life spirit of life which life do you think that is would that be bios physical life would that be or flesh life we could say would that be suke which is psychological or life of the mind will in the emotion or would that be zoe eternal uncreated life of god it's zoe it's zoe the spirit of life is zoey it's understanding that the holy ghost is recreating in us the life of christ the zoe divine life of god uncreated no one created that life it was of god it came from the great fountain of light it came from the beginning you can read about brother branham's understandings of the creation and how the logos came forth it's powerful and it lines up with the word and i love that can i read now romans 8 10 and 11. and i know i think i know now where i'll stop i'll stop shortly no no no i know i know sister joyce that you'd be here and you'd be awake 10 and 11. and if and also know that you're one of those that if you miss a service you catch up and i appreciate that very much i don't ever have to go back and say to brother greeley did you hear that did you did you what'd you think of that because he does why because he wants to stay up with where we are and where we're going i advise you to do the same there's a lot of things out there that catch our attention and i don't feel bad to ask you to catch up on a service that you miss because i know you're going to spend time on youtube i know you're going to spend time on on podcasts i know you're going to spend time on other things during the week and it would certainly be helpful especially in a study that lays line upon line like this if you happen to miss something you just go back and catch it and i'll just mention for you that are here the the the uh wedding i started saying the graduation the wedding is is on the app already and uh we did stream and there were some people who said that they had a problem i think that must have been on their end because we didn't have any problem on our end and even if you missed some of it all you have to do now it's already on the app you can see it it's right up there printed very very easy to follow if you want to go back and watch it or if you have somebody maybe a family member that didn't get to stream you can god has been good to us to give us this technology that we can hold it in the palm of our hand and we had been given permission to put drew green's a cd on he's a cowboy singer it's brother green's uh a grandson it's his only project and we had been given permission uh a year or more ago to put his a cd on there for people who like that country sound of of gospel music and i do on occasion i really do and uh the the need came up that one of the one of the relatives was in the hospital in real bad shape and they had been listening to sister green's cd on our app and so uh they sent a note and said do you think you might be able to get that up for us so that we could uh so that the relative could hear it in the in the icu and we were able to do that just like that rj jumped right on it and got it done and that was able to play maybe in that room and be a blessing in god good to us to give us technology like that okay back to it now verse 10 and 11. same chapter romans 8 and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin here you are walking around dead men walking because the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness do you think that's bios life you think that's biology life you think that's botany life you do you think that is suikey life you think that's life psychology life the mind live no no no no but the spirit is zoe but the spirit is divine life but the spirit is uncreated life because of righteousness whose verse 11 but if the spirit whoa if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you do you think that's bios life no no no no no this is spirit life zoe life divine life eternal life uncreated life resurrection life if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken here you are walking around in a dead body but because of sin but that resurrection life shall quicken your mortal body by his spirit that dwelleth in you now i know that's blessed hope for a resurrection out there but that's not all that is don't you think you have to be graveyard dead to experience resurrection life when you receive the holy ghost one of his offices in your life is to administer to you to execute to you the life of christ which is resurrection life so even right now in a body dead because of sin you are walking around with a resurrection on the inside of you whoa i've got a resurrection inside of me i've got a resurrection inside of me i have a resurrection living inside of me hallelujah praise god so don't worry don't worry if you lay this down if you watch this leaving don't worry there's a resurrection inside of me there's a resurrection inside of me there's a part of me that will never die there's a part of me that's already eternal hallelujah we just change robes death is just a doorway hallelujah you really believe that if i didn't i couldn't face my i couldn't face the reality of how close 60s getting how old was chris you remember the one who passed away a friend in new brunswick lake alberta in the front line church there the last time i saw him he said to me when i grow up i want to be like you and i said that's good when i grow up i want to have a beard like yours it's it was epic he had the most tender spirit kind young man worked in the sound was a blessing to so many people we're seeing really what an effect he had on lots of different groups and churches and just a real nice spirit about him and he was on the way somewhere on a motorcycle and tragically crashed and lost his life and there's a church in a family that's grieving i don't know what the results of the of the accident out here but by the time we got there the wreck was cleared and they were hauling off the three motorbikes two on one truck and one on another i don't know if anybody died i don't know if i was hurt but i'm telling you it could have been just it's like that this young man had rode a motorcycle his whole life and so it's just that it's just that moment some people call it a freak accident i don't believe that believers are taken out of here by such it's divine appointments it may look freakish it may look like fate it may look like just an accident but oh my god knows he knew when i was born the day i was going to leave here he knew he knew and so you don't have to be old you don't have to be old but if you've got a resurrection life living on the inside of you you're just changing bodies you're just changing robes thank you for helping me if that spirit that raised jeep now look the spirit of life that was in verse 10 is zoe life that word life is zoe because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal body by his spirit that dwelleth in you now before we close when the when the bible when the scriptures refer to the holy spirit as the spirit of something they signify that the holy spirit is the executor or the office of the spirit being named so if we say the spirit of life life is being ministered in you by the work of the holy spirit you understand it's the holy spirit it's the holy ghost it's him he's one but one of the things that he accomplishes in our life is he brings to us the spirit of life the breath of god and that's pretty powerful isn't it now you want to jot this down you probably won't have time because i'm going to go too quick but i'm going to read to you the rest of these so that you might be able to just know where we're going number two the spirit of truth number three the spirit of adoption number four the spirit of holiness number five the spirit of grace number six the spirit of supplication and number seven the spirit of glory now every one of those words ministries are referred to in the new testament as the spirit of the spirit of truth the spirit of adoption the spirit of life the spirit of supplication and but it's all by the same holy spirit it's just one of the works that he accomplishes in our lives and i don't know about you but i'm very very thankful for the life that's dwelling inside of me if you can understand that say amen let me just give you one more john 1 4 and 5. in him was life what life do you think that was zoe in him was zoe and the life zoe was the light of men do you remember we talked about this not too long ago in fact we it was when we were doing the study on bios on success him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not would you give me the quote please there is a man here that can turn on the light we had this quote not too long ago but here it is again there's no two or three lights said remember the verse said in him was life and the life was the light of men there's no two or three lights no four or five different organizations there was one light there's not methodist baptist lutheran presbyterian christ is the light and the light is the life that's just what the word said and the life was the light of men he said and the word manifested is the light of the hour the word manifested is the light of the hour you know what makes this hour so bright when it's really so dark out there it's that the word is being manifested in this hour in the life of the believer it's not producing a national revival it's producing an individual revival come on now it's producing an individual harvest right now you're being harvested as a son of god you're being raised up by the spirit of his life to be able to overcome the pressures and problems that you're going to face here until we make the change the change is taking place even now it is it's impossible to sit under the light of the hour and not be changed it's impossible to sit under the spirit of life and not be changed and remember where that comes from it comes from the word the word before it was written was living and the spirit of life is what comes to take that written word and transform it it's not transformed between me and you i speak it and a transformation takes place and it and it gets in you as living word that's not how it happens you hear the the retelling of the written word and because the spirit of life resides in you the spirit of life produces an awareness that brings to your spirit man a revelation of the living word and that's what makes it personal if we could only get you as the musicians are coming if we can only get you to understand that more god is doing more for you than you see with a natural eye you you feel so discouraged sometime because you're so stuck still on a vicious cycle repeated behaviors repeated bad habit repeated this repeated bad thoughts repeat and you're so caught in that cycle and that old condemner that old accuser just screamed at you see you're nothing god's not doing anything to you you know you don't belong to god you don't have the holy ghost you ever hear that i've i've said this before and i don't want to brag because he tells me plenty he lies to me just like he lies to you but i have to tell you i've whipped him on one one lie i've whipped him he never tries to tell me anymore that i don't have the baptism of the holy ghost i whupped him on that one which one have you whipped him on there's a way to whoop him and you know what i found sometime we get caught in a vicious trap trying to talk to him oh he's a great sophist you'll never out-talk the devil he's an orator who loves the sound of his voice and he's not happy if it if it's not carrying through the room so that everyone can hear him that's the enemy that's how the enemy operates he loves to talk and so you're never going to win an argument with the devil you don't have to you just have to know once the knowing strikes your life by revelation there's a lot of things that i have not yet had made personal to me yet after serving the lord all these years there's truths that i preach that i have not yet walked out in the fullness that i want to walk them out lots of them i'm not ashamed to tell you lots of them and you could say well then you have no right who will then who will you go find him you go find the man because never mind i won't go there but you go find him and then look at his life how many wives how many how much of that how many to the other and you'll find that to say it is not always to do it and i can tell you there are many many many things that i don't walk in the fullness of that i declare with boldness and faith because i've seen enough of it to know if god can do it and rotten me even in a part he can fulfill his word if i keep trusting him so don't you let the enemy back you into that corner you speak the truth let me tell you what i have found to be quite effective at times once you get a revelation that for instance you have received the baptism i have a revelation just let me share this with you personally as we close i have a revelation that i have received the genuine baptism of the holy ghost you could not tell me and me believe you that i don't i just want you to know that there's a lot of things you can say that affect me and you do and they do but that is not one of them because that's one that i have a personal revelation of and the enemy used to come with that lie see i grew up in pentecost and i've told you before that if i call my grandmother and she didn't answer the phone fear would strike my heart i'd fall on my face i thought i had missed the rapture because granny didn't answer the phone so i thought for sure i know i had a bad thought so i'm sure the rapture has taken place and i'm left here to to go through the tribulation that was what church entity was producing in my life then i found the message so don't you come around here telling me not to call brother branham's name there's a church on every corner you can go to and not hear about it they'll cut god up in three pieces and try to feed him to you and they will be glad to baptize you in a in a false doctrine they'll be glad to baptize you in titles even though we know there's no salvation in titles it only comes in the name that's what the word said they'll be glad to do that so i'm not going to apologize for presenting the message that changed my life when the message came when the truth of this message came i went from that place of i'm oh no granny's gone she didn't answer the phone i must have missed the rapture i went to that place after receiving a revelation i have the holy ghost how could there be a how could there be a rapture and may not be in it if the requirement to go is to have the genuine baptism of the holy oath so brother branham said you come to a place where you say there could be no rapture without me in it somebody said doesn't that sound like pride it does to those who have no revelation but you see it's not me it's not me that's rapture worthy i can tell you several ways why me and my soul are not rapture worthy but i am not being evaluated on my worthiness i am being evaluated by the blood that has been laid on my life and the holy ghost that now lives inside of me and you and you and you this is how god looks at us god you know we go right back to the prophet and david man looks on the outward appearance man will judge you by their preconceived ideas of who you are god sees who you really are you will never be able to convince some people that you don't have a motive an agenda for everything you do or say so just quit trying to fool them quit trying to please them don't even worry about those kinds of things in this hour be sincere be real be honest before god don't think that you can win an argument with the enemy once you get a revelation for instance i have the baptism holy ghost once you have a revelation of that the best thing to do is ignore his lie just ignore his lie you'd be surprised if you don't entertain his lie he eventually will stop telling you that stupid lie watch it and if you just can't be quiet because some people can't just give him the word just answer him like jesus did the word but you can win in a struggle with the enemy once you have a revelation you just don't entertain his lie anymore have you ever said to somebody i know you're talking about i can't hear what you're saying you're just holding up the word of god the truth of the revelation of the message of jesus christ you're just holding that up toward your enemy and you're saying i i know you're talking but i can't hear what you're saying because i've had a revelation of what lives who lives inside of me and he lives there as the spirit of life as the spirit of truth as the spirit of adoption he lives there as the spirit of supplication the spirit of grace the spirit of glory he lives in me as the spirit of holiness it's who he is transforming from the inside out who i am stand together would you we made it we made it this young man who passed away was 28 my wife sent me a text he didn't leave one day earlier than what god saw he was going there may be those who sail him out celebrate him out i hope not but i know how charismatic can be sometime and some people may say oh the enemy was able to kill him but remember that places the enemy of god more powerful than the one who created him everything in me screams that's a lie everything in me screams that's a lie god had a plan does it hurt yeah yes it hurts you know what it feels like it hurts but we have a truth says there's there's something bigger there's a reality that's bigger than what we feel what we think what we see god's bigger than all that have you got something you can lead us in worship let me get my breath and strength he's good all the time how many of you'd like to worship with me for a few moments before we go today do it anyway do it anyway be a better worshiper than you were in a manner focus on him right now give him give him some attention let him know that it that it's because of him it's because of the spirit of life in you that you're able to get up and face face the obstacles that are before you maybe some of you're realizing that you've got some real stuff heading your way and it wears you out focus on him for just a few moments and let the spirit of the lord lift you to a higher place the splendor of the king all hallelujah earth
