[1:12:42] amen
[1:12:44] aren't we blessed
[1:12:46] let's thank God for the songs the word
[1:12:49] the the music the musicians
[1:12:53] the leading of the word
[1:12:55] the leading of the worship I'll get it
[1:12:58] in a minute
[1:12:59] his presence is with us
[1:13:02] be seated just a moment I'd want you to
[1:13:04] stand so long
[1:13:06] we'll take a moment just to say what a
[1:13:09] wonderful Joy privilege and blessing
[1:13:12] it is to be corporately gathered with
[1:13:15] you in the presence of the Lord
[1:13:18] there's nowhere I'd rather be right now
[1:13:20] than where I am
[1:13:21] in his presence with his people if you
[1:13:24] feel that way say Amen if you don't you
[1:13:28] just get a little more him and you'll
[1:13:29] feel that way as well
[1:13:31] there's nowhere like being in God's
[1:13:33] presence you can be in his presence
[1:13:36] anytime you you so desire
[1:13:39] he's as close as the mention of his name
[1:13:44] amen he's been so good to us just over
[1:13:49] 10 days ago when I saw you last many of
[1:13:52] you had had gathered with us at the
[1:13:54] cemetery to pay your respects to my mom
[1:13:58] who has gone to be with the Lord and he
[1:14:02] has strengthened us he has helped us he
[1:14:05] has blessed us and most of the time we
[1:14:08] have rejoiced
[1:14:10] completely and totally that she is in
[1:14:13] her right mind and in the wonderful
[1:14:15] presence of the Lord but there are those
[1:14:18] moments when you think about not having
[1:14:21] your mother and when that comes well I
[1:14:24] just thank God for her life and uh for
[1:14:27] her protection of me she was the epitome
[1:14:32] and the full definition of a mama bear
[1:14:37] if you've ever heard of a mama bear I
[1:14:39] had a mama bear and it's actually good
[1:14:42] for some of you that you didn't have
[1:14:44] perhaps the privilege of knowing her
[1:14:46] because you might have been on the other
[1:14:47] end
[1:14:50] if you got too close to me her
[1:14:53] then those uh claws would come out
[1:14:56] sometimes she was very very protective
[1:14:59] and uh her the hardships of her life
[1:15:02] sort of formed her to be that way
[1:15:05] but the reality when we got home and the
[1:15:07] death certificates were waiting on us
[1:15:09] and all the business that we've had to
[1:15:12] take care of from from out of town uh
[1:15:15] the nursing home and the Medicaid and
[1:15:18] the Medicare and the Social Security and
[1:15:20] all the things that you have to take
[1:15:22] care of just a serve as a constant
[1:15:25] reminder uh that she is not here but she
[1:15:29] really is here
[1:15:30] because we believe what the prophet
[1:15:33] spoke and we believe that our loved ones
[1:15:36] are not a Million Miles Away
[1:15:40] you know we think somebody said well
[1:15:42] Heaven Must Be A Million Miles Away well
[1:15:44] you're you're you're you're you're uh uh
[1:15:47] that's a good guess
[1:15:49] but the reality is our loved ones are
[1:15:52] with us even in this meeting this
[1:15:54] morning someone said wait a minute I
[1:15:57] don't believe in necromancy well then
[1:15:58] don't call out to them
[1:16:01] don't call out to them but they're here
[1:16:04] he told us they're in a faster Dimension
[1:16:07] than the one we're living in right now
[1:16:09] and one of these days we're going to
[1:16:12] speed up and they're going to slow down
[1:16:14] along with our theophany and we're going
[1:16:16] to meet in the middle
[1:16:18] and be together with the Lord
[1:16:21] and one day we will step out of that
[1:16:23] theophany into an eternal glorified body
[1:16:26] that will be ours forever and ever and
[1:16:29] ever and ever and ever in a new Heaven
[1:16:31] and a new Earth
[1:16:33] and uh someone said how do we know that
[1:16:36] the whole thing won't process and repeat
[1:16:39] itself all over again you don't ever
[1:16:41] have to worry about that there will be
[1:16:43] no tempter there
[1:16:46] he's finished
[1:16:49] he will soon have served his purpose the
[1:16:53] very reason why he was created will soon
[1:16:55] come to an end and you and I will live
[1:16:58] forever in the presence of the Lord
[1:17:01] oh what a wonderful Joy it is to know
[1:17:04] that amen so let me say again thank you
[1:17:08] to everyone who showed such love for us
[1:17:11] and to us those of you who were able to
[1:17:15] come and be with us and uh we were able
[1:17:19] thanks to Hawk we were able to share it
[1:17:21] with others who were not able to be
[1:17:24] there it is on the it is on Facebook and
[1:17:27] we did that just simply because there
[1:17:29] were some who had to work and some who
[1:17:31] couldn't travel and some who couldn't be
[1:17:33] there and we wanted to make we wanted to
[1:17:35] share that moment with them and and that
[1:17:38] had a great impact on my family that was
[1:17:41] there and had an impact on friends that
[1:17:44] we haven't seen in a long time and and
[1:17:46] then a few of us ended up at uh Zaxby's
[1:17:51] and and it was just wonderful to sit at
[1:17:53] a long table and have some of my family
[1:17:55] my church family gathered around and
[1:17:58] many thanks to brother Greeley who made
[1:18:00] it possible for us to not not have to
[1:18:04] come all the way back for that weekend
[1:18:06] but to to stay and to enjoy our time
[1:18:09] away and that is quickly coming to an
[1:18:12] end but uh I'm going to savor every last
[1:18:16] moment we will head back south in the
[1:18:19] morning and uh we'll be with you not
[1:18:22] next Sunday but the next and it has been
[1:18:26] life to me I can't tell you if you
[1:18:29] there there's no way to describe it I I
[1:18:32] don't know how to explain it to anybody
[1:18:34] you have to live it you you it has to be
[1:18:37] your life in order to be able to put put
[1:18:39] it into words but I so desperately
[1:18:42] needed a time and I needed an extended
[1:18:45] time and God has provided that in a
[1:18:49] wonderful way and he has blessed us with
[1:18:52] a an incredible location and I am able
[1:18:56] to to spend an hour and a half to two
[1:18:59] hours a day walking down a long stretch
[1:19:04] a two mile stretch of Beach and I might
[1:19:07] see four people the entire time six
[1:19:10] people may be at the most once I hit
[1:19:12] that that stretch
[1:19:14] and just in his presence I I started out
[1:19:18] uh when we first got there listening to
[1:19:21] tapes I was listening to brother Branham
[1:19:23] I was listening to uh to uh something
[1:19:27] else a book on on tape or whatever what
[1:19:29] do they call it audiobook
[1:19:31] and and and it and I was so blessed to
[1:19:34] hear some sermons
[1:19:36] of brother Branham but but finally I
[1:19:39] thought one day I'm going to do it
[1:19:41] without any music I'm going to do it
[1:19:43] without any preaching
[1:19:44] I'm going to really unplug
[1:19:48] anybody know what that's like
[1:19:51] just to really unplug not listen to
[1:19:54] anything but but hope to hear his voice
[1:19:59] and let him speak
[1:20:01] and you know he has been so faithful
[1:20:04] he let me stand with him in Heavenly
[1:20:07] places
[1:20:08] in courtrooms of authority
[1:20:11] and he did that for me I'm so grateful I
[1:20:15] can't tell you how grateful I am
[1:20:18] I was able by the spirit to catch
[1:20:22] several great wrongs being made right
[1:20:28] from his right hand of authority when
[1:20:31] when when when he speaks
[1:20:34] when he renders a judgment
[1:20:37] on behalf of the Saints
[1:20:41] and Heaven's Shake
[1:20:44] and the Earth responds and we if we're
[1:20:49] just walking in the natural realm we
[1:20:51] don't even realize
[1:20:53] what's happening we we hear of Storms
[1:20:56] and we hear of earthquakes
[1:20:59] we hear of natural things happening in
[1:21:02] the Earth and we don't even realize
[1:21:04] sometime that it is a natural reaction
[1:21:08] that's why when people say to me you
[1:21:10] know pray against the tornado and pray
[1:21:13] against this hurricane and pray against
[1:21:15] this strong wind and pray against us
[1:21:18] this Wildfire I don't I don't get on
[1:21:21] that I I that's not the kind of
[1:21:23] intercession that I was called to be a
[1:21:25] part of
[1:21:26] because I I believe our most effective
[1:21:29] intercession is just saying as it is in
[1:21:31] heaven
[1:21:33] Saul let it be on the Earth
[1:21:35] you know Nahum said that God is a god of
[1:21:38] the Whirlwind
[1:21:42] now I don't like to see tragedies and I
[1:21:45] don't I know people have lost homes and
[1:21:47] and lives and I don't like to think
[1:21:49] about those things but I just pray Lord
[1:21:51] your perfect will be done on Earth even
[1:21:56] as it is in heaven and someone says well
[1:21:58] I can't believe that those things are
[1:22:00] are the will of God then why do they
[1:22:02] happen because I don't believe that my
[1:22:05] enemy is more powerful than my God
[1:22:09] yeah
[1:22:10] see I believe God has power to both
[1:22:13] initiate and stop anything that happens
[1:22:15] in the Earth all he has to do you don't
[1:22:18] even have to speak
[1:22:20] he just tilts his head and the Earth has
[1:22:23] to respond how many of you believe that
[1:22:26] but sometimes we see those things
[1:22:28] happening in the in the earth and we we
[1:22:31] we call it the the devil and maybe
[1:22:33] sometimes he stirs things up brother
[1:22:35] Branham said you know he can get out on
[1:22:38] that Lake Superior and he can stir up
[1:22:41] the wind and stir up the waves and stir
[1:22:43] up the waters
[1:22:45] he can't create a storm he just gets in
[1:22:48] there and kind of you know stirs things
[1:22:50] up
[1:22:51] and sometimes the enemy might do that
[1:22:53] but other times for those of you who
[1:22:56] have an ear to hear other times the
[1:22:59] Earth is responding to something that
[1:23:02] has taken place in another realm in
[1:23:06] another dimension when the judge when
[1:23:09] the when the wigged one when when the
[1:23:12] Ancient of Days sitting on his throne
[1:23:15] when he renders a verdict of righteous
[1:23:18] judgment on behalf of the saints of God
[1:23:22] and it it goes like boats of lightning
[1:23:25] out of his mouth through through the
[1:23:28] third heaven all the way down through
[1:23:30] the second heaven and Strikes the Earth
[1:23:33] and Wrongs are made right
[1:23:37] and we don't always even know
[1:23:41] when wrongs are being made right
[1:23:44] but you know God is so beautiful and so
[1:23:47] Sovereign and so holy and we may not all
[1:23:51] be called to walk in those things but we
[1:23:53] can have understanding if we so desire
[1:23:56] to have understanding and governments
[1:23:59] shift and leaders change and and
[1:24:02] decisions are made all the time from him
[1:24:05] from his throne
[1:24:08] and and sometimes we don't even realize
[1:24:11] what has happened
[1:24:12] unless we would have that opportunity
[1:24:15] that that John had
[1:24:18] in Revelation chapter 4 when that voice
[1:24:22] said come up higher
[1:24:24] now now brother Branham said that John
[1:24:27] is a type of the Bride
[1:24:30] are you with me he's a type of the Bride
[1:24:33] so if God gave John the opportunity to
[1:24:37] be caught up into a Heavenly door and
[1:24:40] see things that had not yet taken place
[1:24:42] on the Earth
[1:24:43] if God would do that if brother Brandon
[1:24:46] was right and I believe he was when he
[1:24:48] said John is a type of the Bride then
[1:24:50] then is it so hard for us to imagine
[1:24:53] that there would be situations and
[1:24:56] circumstances when the bride would be
[1:24:59] caught up okay
[1:25:02] I don't hear a lot of faith in here
[1:25:06] that we might be able to participate
[1:25:09] observe
[1:25:12] Lord I don't have to be in the middle
[1:25:14] just let me you have you ever said let
[1:25:16] me be a fly on the wall just let me be a
[1:25:19] casual Observer
[1:25:21] in the great courtroom of Eternity
[1:25:24] when the righteous judge begins to
[1:25:27] render verdicts
[1:25:29] and I I just uh
[1:25:31] I just thank him I I thank him there's
[1:25:34] nothing that refreshes my life more than
[1:25:38] than his Supernatural presence
[1:25:41] and we're just blessed you've been
[1:25:44] having amazing services and brother
[1:25:46] Greeley has been so Faithfully declaring
[1:25:49] such a rich word over our lives
[1:25:52] we are blessed
[1:25:54] and uh these children sitting here on
[1:25:57] the front row Tuesday night listening
[1:26:01] some sometimes sometimes being kids
[1:26:05] sometimes listening it just so happened
[1:26:07] that the camera caught them many times
[1:26:09] having you know disturbances
[1:26:13] and some of the second row kind of
[1:26:15] trying to help them a little bit but but
[1:26:18] there were moments that they were right
[1:26:20] listening and hanging on to every word
[1:26:23] of the Purim story and and uh
[1:26:27] celebrating along with brother Greeley
[1:26:29] and it was wonderful and and I and I
[1:26:31] have to I have to confess that I I was
[1:26:35] sitting in the living room and I I saw
[1:26:37] the head butt
[1:26:42] I saw Elisha and Moses I think it was in
[1:26:45] there and their and their uh
[1:26:48] crash
[1:26:51] I I have to tell you that I'm a nervous
[1:26:54] laugher
[1:26:58] so when something like that happens
[1:27:00] sometimes I hysterically laugh
[1:27:03] even though I knew it must be painful
[1:27:05] Moses I hope you'll forgive me Elisha
[1:27:07] wherever you are I hope you'll forgive
[1:27:09] me for laughing
[1:27:11] because I know it was painful it looked
[1:27:14] painful
[1:27:17] brother Josh come running up to pick the
[1:27:19] shoes up that fell off
[1:27:21] and uh but I just loved I loved being a
[1:27:26] part of it you you you're gonna have to
[1:27:28] be my age or older to appreciate what
[1:27:31] that felt like to be able not to miss it
[1:27:34] I wouldn't wanted to miss that
[1:27:38] somebody said you're just crazy
[1:27:40] I just love them
[1:27:42] and that was if it was meant to happen
[1:27:44] I'm glad I got to see it
[1:27:48] so streaming is wonderful
[1:27:51] but it's not like being here
[1:27:53] are you ready for the word
[1:27:56] let's stand together if you're in a
[1:27:59] hurry you know we have an open door
[1:28:00] policy you slip out anytime you need to
[1:28:04] we love you we appreciate you being here
[1:28:07] today you're always welcome we're going
[1:28:10] to be having an extra service on
[1:28:13] Saturday night April the 1st and we will
[1:28:16] be having uh lunch together the Lord
[1:28:18] willing weather permitting on Sunday
[1:28:21] after the service on April the 2nd I've
[1:28:25] heard from several different groups of
[1:28:27] people who are hoping to be here with us
[1:28:29] and it's going to be a wonderful weekend
[1:28:31] a fellowship with one another fellowship
[1:28:34] with the word fellowship with his Spirit
[1:28:37] isn't that going to be great
[1:28:39] I'm looking forward to it well the
[1:28:42] Lord's been talking to my heart about
[1:28:44] actions and reactions and I wanted to
[1:28:48] preach I I listened to brother Branham
[1:28:50] did you know brother random preached the
[1:28:52] sermon with that's almost a very similar
[1:28:54] title now I listened to it while I was
[1:28:56] away and was quite inspired and
[1:28:59] I was hoping to to preach a little of
[1:29:01] that to you this morning and help you
[1:29:04] and help myself actually because it's a
[1:29:07] powerful thing to understand that every
[1:29:09] action has a reaction we can't always
[1:29:12] control the action
[1:29:14] but we can control the reaction
[1:29:17] in many cases
[1:29:19] and uh but the Lord wouldn't allow that
[1:29:22] for this time that we have together
[1:29:24] today so there's going to be a little
[1:29:27] more of a review you're going to see I
[1:29:30] think as we move out of the summer
[1:29:33] a few months from now and into the fall
[1:29:36] I think you'll see that it was all in
[1:29:39] the mind of God that we go back in and
[1:29:41] refresh our memory and Minds about some
[1:29:45] of the things that God has spoken to us
[1:29:47] I think it will be so helpful as we
[1:29:50] start seeing him unfold
[1:29:52] someone sent me a text this week and
[1:29:55] said brother Shelley what could I pray
[1:29:58] specifically for you about
[1:30:01] I don't get I don't get texts like that
[1:30:05] very often from anyone but this is a
[1:30:08] precious brother and I haven't seen him
[1:30:10] in years and and he sent that to me and
[1:30:13] I I thought about some things that come
[1:30:16] to my mind and I thought no I don't want
[1:30:18] to trouble him with that and I I I I you
[1:30:21] know that's that's uh I think we're
[1:30:23] covering that in prayer and all of a
[1:30:25] sudden uh I just saw Lord if I had one
[1:30:29] desire really a desire from you it would
[1:30:32] be that you would give me more
[1:30:34] Revelation from your word personal
[1:30:37] revelation of your word and then give me
[1:30:41] the spirit of understanding and let me
[1:30:43] have an understanding heart I want to be
[1:30:47] able to understand and and you know God
[1:30:50] is a great Giver of wisdom and
[1:30:52] understanding and Revelation and so if I
[1:30:55] should come to your mind in these last
[1:30:57] days that we are away pray that over my
[1:31:01] life I would appreciate it so much First
[1:31:04] Peter chapter 5 beginning in verse 8.
[1:31:09] the Apostle said let me say to the
[1:31:12] streamers all over the world I see you I
[1:31:16] acknowledge you I am so thankful that
[1:31:19] that you are with us today and let me
[1:31:23] say uh that sister Cindy Chadwick has a
[1:31:28] birthday on Tuesday and sister Emily
[1:31:31] wassinger has a birthday on Tuesday and
[1:31:34] David Yantis has a birthday on Wednesday
[1:31:38] and brother and sister man's anniversary
[1:31:40] is on Friday and God bless them and and
[1:31:45] strengthen them encourage them and
[1:31:47] Friday is also the 60th anniversary of
[1:31:52] the preaching of the seals and you know
[1:31:55] that's a that's a mark That's a
[1:31:57] milestone that's something to Mark 60
[1:32:00] years ago God spoke and he began to
[1:32:04] reveal truths that were hidden
[1:32:08] underneath those seal and you and I have
[1:32:11] been partakers beneficiaries anybody
[1:32:14] here
[1:32:15] Am I by myself this morning no no there
[1:32:19] we are beneficiaries of those truths and
[1:32:23] we're believing that anything that
[1:32:25] hasn't got to us will get to us in due
[1:32:28] time
[1:32:29] we're thankful for what what God gave us
[1:32:32] for what we have and we're thankful that
[1:32:35] God found a servant 60 years ago that he
[1:32:38] could begin to talk through and so much
[1:32:41] you can take those seals and those
[1:32:43] Church ages and they they just uh lay
[1:32:47] over each other so beautifully and you
[1:32:50] can lay them over church history and It
[1:32:53] just fits it just dovetails in such an
[1:32:57] amazing way and and there's so many in
[1:33:00] the church that don't even know it
[1:33:03] I know you're standing
[1:33:05] I I
[1:33:07] I got up I was sitting on the in my
[1:33:11] chair reading
[1:33:12] and on the beach and and I got up to go
[1:33:16] up to the ward the parking lot and you
[1:33:18] don't have to know why you can guess and
[1:33:21] there was an older couple sitting there
[1:33:24] and the wind had had whipped up
[1:33:26] and they were kind of bundled it wasn't
[1:33:28] cold but it was you know how it can be
[1:33:31] around the water
[1:33:33] and uh he even the man had a a towel or
[1:33:37] something around his shoulders
[1:33:39] in the spirit of the Lord spoke to my
[1:33:42] heart and said talk to them
[1:33:45] and I said Lord I don't even know what I
[1:33:48] would say I surely need to go up I've
[1:33:51] got to go Lord
[1:33:53] I need to go I've been holding it I've
[1:33:55] got to go
[1:33:57] but that that ocean you know talk to
[1:34:00] them
[1:34:01] and I thought what will I say I just
[1:34:04] opened my mouth he told me that many
[1:34:06] years ago if you open your mouth I'll
[1:34:09] feel it
[1:34:10] I just opened my mouth and I heard
[1:34:13] myself talking
[1:34:14] you ever had that happen I heard myself
[1:34:17] talking and I said well
[1:34:19] any day at the beach
[1:34:23] is better than a day behind a desk in a
[1:34:28] stuffy old office
[1:34:30] I don't even know why that came out and
[1:34:33] that man said you can say that again
[1:34:37] and his wife said amen
[1:34:41] we just started chatting a little bit
[1:34:43] and they were Christians
[1:34:45] they said we've been watching your
[1:34:47] family we knew you were children of God
[1:34:50] and we were interested to talk to you we
[1:34:53] thought how would we ever be able to
[1:34:55] strike up a conversation with you
[1:34:58] I said well where are you folks from and
[1:35:00] they said Southern Indiana
[1:35:03] I said how Southern well about as South
[1:35:06] as you get we're right across from
[1:35:07] Louisville I said oh you must live in
[1:35:10] Jeffersonville yes we live in Jeff
[1:35:13] and I said well that's very interesting
[1:35:16] I've been there many times and I began
[1:35:18] to talk to them about the Tabernacle
[1:35:21] there and what God did in their Town
[1:35:24] they'd never passed by the Tabernacle
[1:35:29] they've lived there 25 30 years never
[1:35:33] passed by the little brick building
[1:35:34] don't even know he said I say I think
[1:35:37] one time I heard that name but there was
[1:35:40] some negative things attached to it I
[1:35:42] said oh yes that's the cult
[1:35:44] I just tell them
[1:35:45] I don't hide it like some people do I
[1:35:48] said oh that's the cult that follows
[1:35:49] after brother Branham but but there are
[1:35:52] sincere believers
[1:35:54] who believed that he was a man sent from
[1:35:56] God and I began to give them the
[1:35:58] testimony of brother and sister Ledford
[1:36:00] taking the little girl from Middletown
[1:36:02] Ohio healed of leukemia tears began to
[1:36:06] run down that woman's face and she said
[1:36:09] he's still a god of Miracles she said
[1:36:12] I'm a Baptist but she said I know that
[1:36:15] God is still in the healing business
[1:36:18] we just had a Time
[1:36:21] I just talked as fast as I could I
[1:36:24] thought this may be my only chance I
[1:36:26] said revival.org revival.org revival.org
[1:36:29] revival.org I kept saying it over and
[1:36:31] over to try to get anyway you know you
[1:36:34] just don't ever know why God puts you in
[1:36:36] somebody's path those people could have
[1:36:38] been from any place we were sitting next
[1:36:40] to people from a a little foreign couple
[1:36:44] from somewhere they were speaking
[1:36:46] Portuguese you you don't ever know who
[1:36:48] you're running to out there and here
[1:36:51] behind us an elderly couple of all the
[1:36:54] cities in the world Jeffersonville
[1:36:56] Indiana I gave them the address I said
[1:36:59] you ought to at least just ride your car
[1:37:01] by and be able to tell your
[1:37:03] grandchildren that you passed a place
[1:37:05] where Jesus Christ showed up in the 50s
[1:37:08] and 60s and raised the Dead
[1:37:12] I said somebody ought to know it and he
[1:37:15] and you know it thrilled them they said
[1:37:17] in our town
[1:37:19] in our town let me tell you something
[1:37:22] he'll do it wherever we let him
[1:37:26] [Applause]
[1:37:27] First Peter chapter 5 verse 8 be sober
[1:37:33] be vigilant
[1:37:35] because your adversary the devil
[1:37:38] don't tell me he's a roaring lion
[1:37:41] the Bible said as a roaring lion He's a
[1:37:45] hypocrite
[1:37:46] walk in the back he's an imitator
[1:37:50] he's a counterfeit
[1:37:52] walking about seeking whom he may devour
[1:37:56] whom resists steadfast in the faith
[1:37:59] knowing that the same afflictions are
[1:38:02] accomplished in your brethren that are
[1:38:05] in the world
[1:38:06] but the God of all Grace who have called
[1:38:10] us unto his eternal glory by Christ
[1:38:13] Jesus after that she have suffered a
[1:38:16] while make you perfect
[1:38:19] huh
[1:38:21] make you perfect make you complete
[1:38:26] establish strengthen settle you I'd like
[1:38:30] to hear somebody say I want that
[1:38:33] I want to walk in his wholeness I want
[1:38:36] to walk in his Shalom I want to walk in
[1:38:40] his strength I want to be settled in
[1:38:42] this thing I don't want to be a tree
[1:38:44] tossed about in the wind but I want to
[1:38:47] be one that sends my roots down into the
[1:38:50] revealed word of the hour no matter what
[1:38:53] the enemy says or does
[1:38:55] I want to be established I want to be
[1:38:58] strengthened I want to be settled
[1:39:01] to him be glory and Dominion forever and
[1:39:06] ever
[1:39:07] amen may God add his Blessing to the
[1:39:11] reading of his word you may be seated
[1:39:12] I'd like to read the same verses I'm
[1:39:15] going to need your help
[1:39:16] I'd like to read the same verses from
[1:39:19] the Amplified if you don't mind it makes
[1:39:22] it a little louder I like loud you can
[1:39:24] tell
[1:39:26] be well well balanced
[1:39:29] oh
[1:39:31] brother Branham said to brother Perry
[1:39:33] green whatever you do keep your balance
[1:39:39] in the scriptures
[1:39:43] you know that cult that I was mentioning
[1:39:45] out there a moment ago this is what
[1:39:48] where they have fallen off the wagon
[1:39:50] it's because many have have not kept
[1:39:54] their balance in the scripture they find
[1:39:57] a slogan a phrase a quotation from the
[1:40:01] message that they don't understand they
[1:40:04] they don't perceive some time that it
[1:40:07] was a cultural statement they they don't
[1:40:09] understand do you know why they don't
[1:40:11] understand that they don't understand it
[1:40:13] because they have many have failed to
[1:40:16] understand the context of the scripture
[1:40:19] if you can't understand the context of
[1:40:22] the scripture you'll never understand
[1:40:24] the context of the quotes
[1:40:27] you you can't make a a book written by
[1:40:32] Jewish men in a Jewish culture you can't
[1:40:37] understand it with a Greek mentality
[1:40:42] you've got to understand what was
[1:40:44] happening in the time of the Bible you
[1:40:48] don't have to be a scholar you don't
[1:40:50] have to be an expert just a little
[1:40:52] careful reading a little careful study
[1:40:55] will help you to understand for instance
[1:40:58] when we read the New Testament we could
[1:41:00] do a little study on what what the
[1:41:03] environment was like in the second
[1:41:05] temple period what was the political
[1:41:08] situation what was the believer
[1:41:11] situation what were they going through
[1:41:14] at the time what was being said in the
[1:41:17] newspaper in the internet of the day you
[1:41:21] know what was being talked about if we
[1:41:24] can understand sometimes we we read the
[1:41:28] words of Jesus
[1:41:30] many people fail to understand that he's
[1:41:33] quoting the prophets many times Jesus is
[1:41:37] speaking and he's quoting the prophets
[1:41:39] of the Old Testament and so to fully
[1:41:42] understand the Fulfillment of what the
[1:41:44] prophets of the Old Testament said and
[1:41:47] its New Testament reality you've got to
[1:41:49] do a little study you've got to find out
[1:41:52] the mindset I know that's what a lot of
[1:41:54] people believe that's why we have
[1:41:56] pastors and preachers so we do all the
[1:41:58] study but the Bible said that we as
[1:42:01] bereans and I think we should all have
[1:42:03] that kind of a desire in our heart a
[1:42:05] hunger for the word and we should all
[1:42:07] spend a little time in the book for
[1:42:09] ourselves studying it out and asking the
[1:42:13] Holy Spirit to make it real to us and so
[1:42:16] the the people that have failed for
[1:42:19] instance the Feast of Jehovah they
[1:42:21] quickly raise up and call them Jewish
[1:42:24] feasts they take no time to understand
[1:42:27] that these feasts were God's idea
[1:42:30] so they were God's Feasts
[1:42:33] he gave them to his chosen people of the
[1:42:36] day of the time he gave them to the
[1:42:39] nation that he chose to give them to but
[1:42:41] he also spoke to strangers who would
[1:42:44] join themselves to the god of Israel
[1:42:47] that they should also remember those
[1:42:49] things
[1:42:50] [Music]
[1:42:52] anybody with me so to understand even
[1:42:56] even the world calls it Easter
[1:43:03] you can't even understand it if you
[1:43:06] don't see what the scripture talks about
[1:43:09] in the older Testament it's not Easter
[1:43:14] it's Passover
[1:43:17] so you understand and when you start
[1:43:19] spending a little time looking at it you
[1:43:21] find out that one day the Spotless lamb
[1:43:25] came and he did what all the other Lambs
[1:43:28] couldn't do
[1:43:30] oh so many other Lambs gave their lives
[1:43:34] and shed their blood and the temple
[1:43:37] itself couldn't contain the blood that
[1:43:39] was spilled through the years of making
[1:43:41] these offerings to God but here come the
[1:43:44] Lamb of Glory
[1:43:46] not the third person of a trinity by the
[1:43:49] way but the lamb or the second person of
[1:43:51] a trinity no no the lamb the word made
[1:43:54] flesh
[1:43:55] and the Word was with God and the Word
[1:43:57] was God and the word became flesh dwelt
[1:44:00] among us we beheld his glory the glory
[1:44:02] as of the only begotten of the father
[1:44:04] full of grace and truth right
[1:44:06] that's who he is coming down the road
[1:44:09] yesterday listening to a song and I'm
[1:44:11] hearing in the song It's a Wonderful
[1:44:13] little thought about resurrection and
[1:44:15] I'm listening to the recitation and the
[1:44:17] father said and the son said and the
[1:44:19] Holy Spirit said and if you didn't know
[1:44:21] anything any better you'd think there
[1:44:23] were three people having this discussion
[1:44:26] you see many people fail to see what
[1:44:29] brother Branham called the greatest one
[1:44:31] of the most powerful great Revelations
[1:44:35] that any person can have
[1:44:38] if you fail to get this
[1:44:41] you'll never be able to properly apply
[1:44:44] the scripture
[1:44:46] amen somebody said what is it Jehovah
[1:44:55] [Music]
[1:44:57] your behave of hay
[1:45:01] Jehovah of the Old Testament
[1:45:04] [Music]
[1:45:06] is is
[1:45:09] Jesus Christ
[1:45:11] Yeshua hamashiach of the New Testament
[1:45:17] the word became flesh
[1:45:20] if you fail to see that
[1:45:23] you'll baptize the wrong way
[1:45:30] you'll give Jesus two fathers
[1:45:34] he could only have one
[1:45:37] we call the father his father
[1:45:40] but the Bible tells us that it wasn't
[1:45:42] the father who overshadowed Mary
[1:45:44] it was the Holy Spirit who overshadowed
[1:45:47] Mary caused her to conceive how can that
[1:45:50] be said because it's the same eternal
[1:45:52] spirit
[1:45:55] the eternal spirit of the Father the
[1:45:57] same spirit that come in a different
[1:45:59] office a different Administration the
[1:46:02] Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit overshadowed
[1:46:05] Mary and that which was born in her and
[1:46:08] formed in her was of the Holy One
[1:46:11] it was by the spirit of God so Jesus
[1:46:14] didn't have two fathers he had one
[1:46:16] father he was conceived by the Holy
[1:46:19] Spirit you say we all we know that but
[1:46:21] you don't know how blessed we are to
[1:46:23] know it
[1:46:26] did you know tens of thousands of people
[1:46:28] flock to whatever's moving and
[1:46:30] whatever's happening and whatever
[1:46:32] sizzling at the time and many people are
[1:46:35] touched and blessed and healed and
[1:46:37] strength and strengthened and encouraged
[1:46:39] and all the different things that happen
[1:46:41] when we get where God is moving and so
[1:46:43] many walk away still not understanding
[1:46:46] who God is and how are we going to
[1:46:50] properly be able to discern the day and
[1:46:52] the hour that we're living in if we
[1:46:55] cannot properly discern the God we serve
[1:47:00] somebody said these things don't matter
[1:47:01] if they don't matter then why did the
[1:47:03] men give their lives so that you can I I
[1:47:06] could have a book that tells us these
[1:47:09] truths
[1:47:11] sure it matters
[1:47:13] church doctrine may not matter but
[1:47:15] biblical truth matters can anybody say
[1:47:18] man we're living in a day of charismatic
[1:47:21] chaos where people can believe whatever
[1:47:24] feels good to believe
[1:47:26] but how many of you know God has sent a
[1:47:28] plum line he dropped it right out of
[1:47:31] Eternity and it falls right in the
[1:47:33] middle of God's word and it's his way or
[1:47:36] no way it's his word or none at all
[1:47:40] we can't choose the way we approach God
[1:47:42] we must approach him the Bible way we
[1:47:45] can't choose how to praise God We Must
[1:47:47] Praise Him the Bible Way
[1:47:50] there's a way that's been prescribed for
[1:47:52] us in this day aren't you glad you're a
[1:47:54] part of the prescription aren't you glad
[1:47:56] it was delivered to your address
[1:47:58] okay now let's hurry
[1:48:02] we haven't even read the text
[1:48:04] be well balanced temperate
[1:48:07] sober of mind
[1:48:10] be vigilant
[1:48:12] it's not not wrong to have a sense of
[1:48:15] humor
[1:48:17] no God has a sense of humor
[1:48:20] somebody said how do you know look
[1:48:22] around
[1:48:26] [Music]
[1:48:31] they all looked at brother Daniel
[1:48:42] well I've always heard that there are
[1:48:43] some some perfect heads
[1:48:47] and the others he covered with hair
[1:48:51] we don't all look the same we don't all
[1:48:54] act the same
[1:48:56] we don't all worship the same
[1:48:58] God's a god of variety
[1:49:02] he has a sense of humor it's all right
[1:49:05] for you to have a sense of humor
[1:49:07] I want to tell people something I'm just
[1:49:09] lighting up just a little bit
[1:49:12] just a little bit
[1:49:14] because religion
[1:49:16] stinks
[1:49:19] religion breeds death
[1:49:22] it's only a relationship with Jesus
[1:49:24] Christ that's going to have life and
[1:49:26] victory and hope and love and
[1:49:28] deliverance in it amen so it's all right
[1:49:30] it's all right to have a sense of humor
[1:49:31] but there's a time that we need to be
[1:49:33] sober of Mind and Spirit
[1:49:35] [Music]
[1:49:36] there's a time to laugh and there's a
[1:49:39] time to be serious you believe that
[1:49:41] there's a balance we need a balance be
[1:49:43] well balanced be temperate be sober of
[1:49:46] mine be vigilant and cautious at all
[1:49:48] time he didn't say paranoid
[1:49:52] he didn't say be Anointed with the
[1:49:54] spirit of Suspicion
[1:49:57] he said be cautious
[1:50:01] it means to to to move circumspectly to
[1:50:05] to consider the way things
[1:50:10] it means that we should be careful how
[1:50:13] we react
[1:50:16] for that enemy of yours the Devil roams
[1:50:20] around like a lion roaring in Fierce
[1:50:25] hunger
[1:50:26] I like to tell people
[1:50:29] that enemy of yours like a roaring lion
[1:50:32] he doesn't want to chew your leg
[1:50:35] he would like to destroy your life
[1:50:38] he would like to consume you the enemy
[1:50:41] would like to eat you up
[1:50:43] until there was nothing left of you but
[1:50:46] how many of you know greater is he that
[1:50:48] is in you
[1:50:49] that he that is in that enemy
[1:50:52] you need to tell him that your creator
[1:50:55] is the same one that made him
[1:50:58] the same one made you you dirty scum
[1:51:01] made me
[1:51:02] and you're serving your purpose and I am
[1:51:06] serving mine
[1:51:08] and I'm going to overcome
[1:51:12] by the blood of the lamb and by the word
[1:51:15] of my testimony
[1:51:21] lion roaring in Fierce hunger seeking
[1:51:24] someone to seize upon and devour can I
[1:51:28] just remind you that the enemy knows
[1:51:30] exactly who to approach
[1:51:33] [Music]
[1:51:34] he knows exactly when to talk to you
[1:51:38] he's never going to talk to you when
[1:51:40] you're shouting the victory
[1:51:41] [Music]
[1:51:43] he's never going to talk to you when
[1:51:44] you're up on the mountain somewhere
[1:51:46] giving God praise full of the Holy Ghost
[1:51:49] talking in tongues jumping up and down
[1:51:52] with a praise in your heart
[1:51:54] he's gonna wait until you have withdrawn
[1:51:56] until you have pulled in your own mind
[1:52:00] until you're walking through that that
[1:52:02] Valley of mind will and emotion
[1:52:06] he's going to magnify things that don't
[1:52:09] need to be magnified
[1:52:11] he's going to minimalize things anybody
[1:52:14] awake
[1:52:15] I don't know how you could sleep this
[1:52:17] morning
[1:52:23] he's going to try to minimalize things
[1:52:25] that don't need to be minimalized
[1:52:28] he's going to wait until he can find you
[1:52:30] in a vulnerable moment and he's going to
[1:52:33] desire and he will if you let him seize
[1:52:35] upon you
[1:52:36] not just ignore you
[1:52:39] but to devour you the Bible said
[1:52:42] withstand him
[1:52:48] remember that message that I've preached
[1:52:50] all over the world about how to face off
[1:52:52] with a hungry lion
[1:52:54] you just raise up bigger than he is
[1:52:57] I'm just telling you what they said
[1:53:00] not sudden movements but deliberate
[1:53:03] movements
[1:53:04] and the best way you can get your hands
[1:53:07] above your head
[1:53:09] [Music]
[1:53:13] face off your enemy with your hands in
[1:53:16] the air because you're never bigger than
[1:53:19] you are when you are
[1:53:21] praising and giving God glory
[1:53:26] you look more ferocious when you're
[1:53:28] praising God when you're warring in
[1:53:31] praise you look like more than a snack
[1:53:37] you look like you might turn on your
[1:53:39] attacker
[1:53:41] you might pursue your pursuer
[1:53:44] you might chase after your Chase you
[1:53:47] might devour your Devourer
[1:53:49] when you get connected to your creator
[1:53:51] you raise up don't shrink down don't
[1:53:55] don't uh you know uh shrink away in fear
[1:54:00] but withstand him be firm in faith like
[1:54:04] brother Huck was talking about against
[1:54:06] his onset rooted established strong
[1:54:10] immovable and what
[1:54:12] determined
[1:54:16] there are determined people here this
[1:54:18] morning you may not be one of them
[1:54:22] but there are determined people in this
[1:54:24] house
[1:54:25] who are going to press this thing all
[1:54:28] the way
[1:54:29] you know why they got to meet up mind
[1:54:32] if you don't have a maid of mind let me
[1:54:33] tell you something I can tell by the way
[1:54:35] you respond to the word brother Greeley
[1:54:37] can tell by the way you respond to the
[1:54:39] word I don't mean how loud you are
[1:54:42] I mean how you pull in faith you use
[1:54:44] your faith to pull on that word we can
[1:54:46] tell by the way you respond to the word
[1:54:48] whether you're determined or not
[1:54:51] your amen reveals a whole lot about you
[1:54:55] your naps reveal a whole lot about you
[1:54:57] too
[1:55:02] yes I'm not going to apologize for that
[1:55:05] I'm not in town long enough to apologize
[1:55:08] knowing that the same identical
[1:55:11] sufferings are appointed to your
[1:55:12] Brotherhood the whole body of Christians
[1:55:14] throughout the world you know what I can
[1:55:16] just summarize that by saying you ain't
[1:55:19] the only one in a battle
[1:55:25] I just want you to know you hey I know
[1:55:28] it's not good English but you can
[1:55:29] understand it can't you
[1:55:31] a problem
[1:55:34] oh the saints of God are facing the same
[1:55:38] devil and the same enemy but we're not
[1:55:41] going to use that as an excuse to lay
[1:55:44] down and let him Stomp all over us
[1:55:47] never
[1:55:49] come on we're not going to spend our
[1:55:51] time rubbing our wounds
[1:55:55] moaning and groaning
[1:55:59] right
[1:56:02] told my wife at least once while we were
[1:56:05] away I said honey
[1:56:06] somebody's grumbling
[1:56:10] our normals very supportive church
[1:56:13] family
[1:56:15] somebody's grumbling
[1:56:17] and I hope they'll be very very careful
[1:56:20] in their grumbling
[1:56:24] because there are seasons where it's all
[1:56:27] right
[1:56:28] to be human
[1:56:30] in their Seasons where it's deadly
[1:56:33] spiritually deadly to be a normal
[1:56:36] everyday Joe Blow human
[1:56:41] somebody said what in the word are you
[1:56:42] talking about your supernatural
[1:56:44] creatures
[1:56:45] you can't let your life cause you to
[1:56:47] look on the outside you've got to look
[1:56:50] for something higher than that
[1:56:52] oh my in other words you're not going to
[1:56:55] just just what I said a few moments ago
[1:56:56] I hope you didn't miss it what I said a
[1:56:58] few moments ago you're not going to jump
[1:57:00] on the bandwagon and pray against the
[1:57:02] storm
[1:57:04] unless you know that the Lord is
[1:57:06] inspiring you to pray against the storm
[1:57:08] what are you going to do if you find out
[1:57:10] God is in the storm the scripture said
[1:57:12] he's a god of the Whirlwind so you might
[1:57:14] find yourself praying against God
[1:57:15] brother Brandon said whatever you do you
[1:57:17] don't want to find yourself praying to
[1:57:19] take something off
[1:57:24] that God put on
[1:57:27] why would he do such a thing as that
[1:57:28] because your book has been written
[1:57:31] your story is already recorded in the
[1:57:34] books of heaven and you and I are here
[1:57:36] fighting sometimes struggling sometimes
[1:57:39] yielding some time to walk out our page
[1:57:44] how many of you have been mindful I hope
[1:57:46] you've been mindful lately since it was
[1:57:48] the theme when we were leaving the theme
[1:57:50] was that we would discover what God
[1:57:52] would have us to do today that's why no
[1:57:55] matter how bad I needed to get up to the
[1:57:57] parking lot I I remained there to talk
[1:58:00] to that couple because the Lord had
[1:58:02] given me the instructions to do so and
[1:58:05] may never see them again may never pass
[1:58:07] their way you know how it works you know
[1:58:09] how God deals with you you may never
[1:58:11] ready you may never know the fruit of it
[1:58:13] but in eternity
[1:58:15] you might see somebody walking down the
[1:58:18] road and you say oh I remember you
[1:58:21] [Applause]
[1:58:21] [Music]
[1:58:23] we strengthen one another on the way
[1:58:27] we encouraged one another on the way
[1:58:31] they told me we spend our day studying
[1:58:33] the word we're retired we go from here
[1:58:36] to here they name some of the places
[1:58:37] they like to go and spend time and we
[1:58:40] spend our day studying the word and I
[1:58:42] said well I'm so glad I met you because
[1:58:43] I can give you something to chew on
[1:58:47] I've got some things I'd like to point
[1:58:49] you toward that that might take you I
[1:58:52] mean I I said you know I I don't in any
[1:58:56] way profess or confess to know it all
[1:58:59] but I know part of the journey and and
[1:59:01] the little lady spoke up she said well I
[1:59:03] can tell you that that's how the Holy
[1:59:05] Spirit leads
[1:59:08] she said because we started out in the
[1:59:10] Baptist Church and and God moved us
[1:59:12] around to two or three different ones
[1:59:13] now we're in a Christian church but she
[1:59:16] said really I told my husband the other
[1:59:19] day we're really Pentecostal in our
[1:59:21] hearts
[1:59:24] and he said wife whatever would make you
[1:59:27] say something she said because we love
[1:59:30] Jesus
[1:59:31] [Applause]
[1:59:38] you're not the only one God's leading
[1:59:40] I'm not the only one God's leading
[1:59:44] don't be offended when somebody tells
[1:59:46] you there's more
[1:59:48] let's see if there is
[1:59:50] [Applause]
[1:59:52] maybe I am looking back there and seeing
[1:59:55] sister Trish and maybe that's making me
[1:59:57] think of brother green I don't know but
[1:59:59] but brother green used to tell them when
[2:00:01] they would leave his church
[2:00:03] and uh you know I
[2:00:07] I was on the other end of that
[2:00:09] because he one time quite a few people
[2:00:12] left his church to move here so I know
[2:00:14] what it feels like to be on the other
[2:00:15] end of that ah but he would get up and
[2:00:18] say you know go if God is telling you to
[2:00:22] go
[2:00:23] and if you find something that we don't
[2:00:25] have here come back and tell us
[2:00:33] that's the attitude we ought to have
[2:00:36] if you can go find something better than
[2:00:39] what we got go find it but once you get
[2:00:41] there don't just get fat
[2:00:44] you come back and tell us hey there's
[2:00:48] more where'd that come from

[2:01:05] Lord

[2:01:13] the same identical sovereigns are
[2:01:14] pointed to your Brotherhood the whole
[2:01:15] body of Christians throughout the world
[2:01:17] next verse
[2:01:19] and after you have suffered a little
[2:01:21] while the God of all Grace who imparts
[2:01:24] all blessing in favor who has called you
[2:01:26] to his own eternal glory in Christ Jesus
[2:01:28] Will himself complete and make you
[2:01:35] oh I don't mean to be lazy
[2:01:39] because I don't think laziness is going
[2:01:40] to get it done
[2:01:42] but isn't it a wonderful Revelation
[2:01:45] reality to know that it's not me making
[2:01:48] myself like him
[2:01:51] [Music]
[2:01:54] I don't have to wear a saffron robe I
[2:01:56] don't have to hide in a cave I don't
[2:01:59] have to do things that people do
[2:02:00] sometime to be like Jesus I don't have
[2:02:03] to work at it
[2:02:05] to be a holy man come on all I have to
[2:02:09] do is yield my will pull my mind down
[2:02:12] pull my thoughts down pull my emotions
[2:02:15] down are you with me
[2:02:17] and allow him because he's the one who
[2:02:19] will complete us and make us what we
[2:02:22] ought to be establish us ground us
[2:02:26] securely and strengthen and do what
[2:02:31] settle us
[2:02:34] have you ever met anybody they didn't it
[2:02:36] wasn't that they needed a total
[2:02:38] Deliverance they they just needed to be
[2:02:41] settled
[2:02:43] the spirit of God will settle you in
[2:02:47] that word
[2:02:48] is anybody with me now that word
[2:02:51] adversary let's hurry that word
[2:02:54] adversary that's used in the in in First
[2:02:57] Peter 5 is made up of two Greek words
[2:03:01] auntie
[2:03:03] and dicos
[2:03:06] anti-anti or anti means instead of or in
[2:03:11] the place of in some context it can also
[2:03:15] mean to be against
[2:03:17] and die course means rights as
[2:03:22] self-evident
[2:03:24] now notice that's kind of an important
[2:03:28] understanding of the word
[2:03:32] adversary
[2:03:34] because there is a a word a portion of
[2:03:39] that word comes from a Greek word that
[2:03:43] speaks of legalities
[2:03:46] so when we see these two Greek words
[2:03:49] come together
[2:03:51] it means to stand against rights
[2:03:56] or to stand against what rightfully
[2:04:01] belongs to someone
[2:04:04] let me read it again to stand against
[2:04:07] what rightfully belongs to someone the
[2:04:12] enemy your adversary is standing against
[2:04:16] you and heriting what rightfully belongs
[2:04:22] to you he want he doesn't need it for
[2:04:25] himself he just wants to dispossess you
[2:04:30] remember he's the klept he's the thief
[2:04:32] the one who steals not because he needs
[2:04:35] he steals for the thrill of stealing
[2:04:39] your adversary will steal your joy
[2:04:42] having no need of your joy
[2:04:46] but knowing that you have a legal right
[2:04:48] to it he places himself between you and
[2:04:53] your joy
[2:04:55] so you've got to move him out of the way
[2:04:59] you have to dispossess him before he
[2:05:03] dispossesses you
[2:05:05] you've got to dismantle him before he
[2:05:09] dismantles you you 've got to steal his
[2:05:13] rights
[2:05:14] his right of accusation before he
[2:05:18] destroys you with his accusation
[2:05:21] anybody understand you are dismantling
[2:05:24] the enemy the accuser the adversary you
[2:05:27] are dismantling his case against you
[2:05:30] you are not allowing the Devil to stand
[2:05:33] between you and your inheritance anybody
[2:05:35] with me it's only hour one come back to
[2:05:38] me let's have church here for a moment
[2:05:40] the enemy wants to stand between you and
[2:05:42] the bridal inheritance
[2:05:45] that's already yours it's already
[2:05:47] secured your name is on it it's written
[2:05:50] in your book
[2:05:51] but he wants to get between you and your
[2:05:53] joy he wants to get between you and your
[2:05:55] inheritance he wants to get between you
[2:05:57] and the authority that God's given you
[2:05:59] to use the spoken word
[2:06:00] come on
[2:06:02] he wants to get between you and your
[2:06:05] ability to speak healing to your own
[2:06:06] body
[2:06:08] to speak to the cells of your own body
[2:06:10] and call them into alignment
[2:06:13] is part of what I've been practicing as
[2:06:15] I go up and down the way I've been
[2:06:17] calling to the cells of my body and the
[2:06:19] authority of the Creator and commanding
[2:06:21] that they begin to come back into
[2:06:23] alignment with what is mine it's mine
[2:06:26] healing is mine Divine health is mine
[2:06:31] every rebellious cell has to respond to
[2:06:34] the authority of the bridegroom
[2:06:37] come back in the line
[2:06:41] yes yes
[2:06:44] every muscle every nerve every bone
[2:06:49] but you have to learn to take the time
[2:06:51] you have to make the time
[2:06:53] to take the authority that's yours are
[2:06:56] you with me
[2:06:57] because that accused now
[2:06:59] uh
[2:07:03] maybe I'm not quite ready to say that
[2:07:05] yet we will in a minute
[2:07:09] so this adversary
[2:07:12] it comes from that word
[2:07:17] anti-dicos anti-dikos
[2:07:20] you put the two words together
[2:07:22] and it means one who brings a charge in
[2:07:26] a lawsuit
[2:07:29] an accuser a plaintiff an opponent an
[2:07:34] opponent at law
[2:07:35] so this if the devil if the scripture
[2:07:38] indicates that the enemy the devil Satan
[2:07:40] is our accuser what it means is he is
[2:07:44] bringing an accusation
[2:07:47] against us
[2:07:50] in the same manner that someone might
[2:07:52] sue you
[2:07:57] anybody ever told you I'm going to sue
[2:07:59] you
[2:08:01] well it's not good words to hear
[2:08:04] it don't encourage you when somebody
[2:08:05] says I'm going to sue you
[2:08:07] but here's what you need to know about
[2:08:09] suing
[2:08:11] they can
[2:08:14] somebody said you can't oh yeah
[2:08:20] yeah did you know the thief
[2:08:23] can break in your house
[2:08:26] trip over your furniture
[2:08:30] and sue you for his injury
[2:08:39] he better hope that's the only injury he
[2:08:42] gets
[2:08:46] we we we're alabamians here
[2:08:50] you do whatever you want to do in my
[2:08:52] yard but you come in my house that's a
[2:08:53] different story
[2:08:56] you can stand on the outside and huff
[2:08:58] and puff and blow the house down do
[2:09:00] whatever you need to do but you come
[2:09:02] inside that's going to be a little bit
[2:09:04] of a different story it's a horrible
[2:09:06] thought to think somebody can come in
[2:09:07] your house fall over and break their
[2:09:09] ankle and sue you for their for their
[2:09:11] damages
[2:09:12] when you didn't invite them in but you
[2:09:15] can't you can sue about anything
[2:09:18] but that doesn't mean you're going to
[2:09:19] win
[2:09:24] I can sue you for wearing the same tie
[2:09:29] if I can find a Jack Leggett lawyer
[2:09:32] somewhere to bring a suit and can think
[2:09:34] of some I'm not making it up you ought
[2:09:36] to read lists there's lists out there of
[2:09:38] all the crazy lawsuits you can come up
[2:09:40] with
[2:09:42] you're infringing on my trademark
[2:09:47] go home and throw them red ties out of
[2:09:50] your closet
[2:09:51] because I'm wearing one today it's my
[2:09:54] trademark and I'm going to sue you if
[2:09:56] you wear one
[2:09:58] you've just got to find the right crazy
[2:10:00] lawyer and he'll say yes that's a part
[2:10:03] of you that yes Siri you wear that
[2:10:05] threes oh Nathan you're in big trouble
[2:10:08] I just looked back there and saw how red
[2:10:10] his is it's really red
[2:10:13] oh it's hot pink
[2:10:17] you can have it I'm not gonna wear it
[2:10:18] but it don't look it don't look hot pink
[2:10:20] to me
[2:10:24] you can sue for any reason just make up
[2:10:27] something you can find somebody to
[2:10:30] manipulate the law but that doesn't mean
[2:10:33] they're going to win
[2:10:35] so you have an accuser and he will
[2:10:38] accuse you of all kinds of shenanigans
[2:10:43] it doesn't have to be true
[2:10:50] it doesn't have to be true for the devil
[2:10:51] to say it
[2:10:52] it doesn't have to be true for the enemy
[2:10:54] to come against you in a certain area of
[2:10:56] your life you don't have to be guilty of
[2:10:58] it for the enemy to say you are anybody
[2:11:00] with me
[2:11:01] anybody with me you've just got to make
[2:11:03] sure that when the accuser is standing
[2:11:06] between you and your joy standing
[2:11:08] between you and your healing standing
[2:11:10] between you and your Victory you've got
[2:11:12] to make sure that he has no legal right
[2:11:15] all right
[2:11:16] because I want you to know it's not a
[2:11:19] decision you and I make alone it's a
[2:11:22] decision that's made in the authorities
[2:11:24] above
[2:11:28] you're going to want to know like the
[2:11:30] prophet told us you're going to want to
[2:11:32] make sure there are no dead cats on the
[2:11:34] line
[2:11:35] you're going to want to make sure
[2:11:36] there's no unconfessed sin
[2:11:38] because the enemy will come he'll try to
[2:11:40] take your family
[2:11:42] he'll try to take your children right
[2:11:44] out of the faith anybody with me
[2:11:46] he'll try to take you home
[2:11:49] did you know we're living in a society
[2:11:51] today where people can can can
[2:11:54] file rights and quick claim deeds
[2:11:59] on your own property
[2:12:04] never walking in the door never been to
[2:12:07] your house
[2:12:09] did you know you can let somebody stay
[2:12:11] with you and if they stay long enough
[2:12:16] they've got rights
[2:12:20] you can't just ask them to leave when
[2:12:22] you can
[2:12:24] but you may find out you're on the wrong
[2:12:26] end of the law
[2:12:27] I actually know a couple that went
[2:12:29] through something like that they hired a
[2:12:31] housekeeper and at the end of her
[2:12:33] contract they didn't want to keep her
[2:12:35] own anymore
[2:12:36] and their her contract had come to an
[2:12:38] end they had a legal written contract
[2:12:40] but she had been living there long
[2:12:42] enough that in that particular state
[2:12:45] she had the right to make a claim
[2:12:51] I know a church
[2:12:54] a few states away from here
[2:12:57] where pastors going through the very
[2:12:59] thing
[2:13:00] a woman living in the parsonage he
[2:13:03] didn't need the parsonage
[2:13:05] he let a woman live in the Parsons she's
[2:13:07] been living there for years he's tried
[2:13:09] to get her out
[2:13:12] and not too many months ago
[2:13:14] they go to church on Sunday and the
[2:13:17] church sign has been taken down brand
[2:13:20] new church sign taken down and hauled
[2:13:22] off and the locks have been changed and
[2:13:25] they don't even have a door a key to get
[2:13:27] in their own church because she living
[2:13:30] out here in the parsonage has gone to
[2:13:33] the law and someone has took her side
[2:13:38] is wicked
[2:13:39] but that's the hour we're living in
[2:13:43] where it doesn't have to be true to
[2:13:45] stand up in court and it's they're
[2:13:48] having to go through all kinds yes one
[2:13:50] day eventually they'll win and they'll
[2:13:52] get her out eventually but the poor old
[2:13:55] Pastor is about crazy
[2:13:57] from having to deal with the mess and
[2:14:00] people are tired of fighting the
[2:14:02] situation and they get worn out let me
[2:14:04] tell you something the enemy always has
[2:14:08] a case against you
[2:14:11] it doesn't have to be true he'll tell
[2:14:14] you he'll convince you
[2:14:18] he'll call you a loser and a failure and
[2:14:22] a thief and a liar and
[2:14:27] you know we almost get to a place where
[2:14:29] we tiptoe around the enemy
[2:14:33] I don't want to attempt tour around him
[2:14:37] there's a brother in our church who's
[2:14:39] just started a business
[2:14:42] and I bless him and I believe God's
[2:14:43] going to prosper him
[2:14:45] but I've been watching how people refer
[2:14:47] to that and how they talk about it in
[2:14:49] the different things that come in come
[2:14:50] come out of people's mouths when they're
[2:14:52] expressing it and you know what I hear
[2:14:54] so very often brother Greeley I hear
[2:14:55] people saying if God blesses it
[2:14:59] come on
[2:15:04] not if God blesses it I've heard it
[2:15:07] through nobody meant any harm but I've
[2:15:09] heard three different conversations
[2:15:11] where people say now if God blesses it
[2:15:13] if God if God blesses uh no no no no
[2:15:16] that's not the way you operate you're
[2:15:19] intimidated
[2:15:21] the enemy has intimidated our language
[2:15:25] and we're tiptoeing around the enemy
[2:15:28] so don't you speak about that brother or
[2:15:30] his business that way at all let me show
[2:15:34] you how to speak about it God is going
[2:15:37] to bless that brother
[2:15:40] God is going to bless that business
[2:15:44] see it like brother really said it God
[2:15:46] made the promise
[2:15:47] he just happens to be one who said now
[2:15:50] is my time to take that prophecy as part
[2:15:54] of my life and God is going to bless me
[2:16:00] don't be afraid to say it if you beat
[2:16:03] God's conditions he has obligated
[2:16:06] himself
[2:16:08] you don't have to obligate God God has
[2:16:11] obligated himself he's made a legal
[2:16:14] contract with us
[2:16:17] pay your time
[2:16:20] be faithful to God be faithful to God's
[2:16:24] house and then you can cut all that
[2:16:27] tiptoe talk
[2:16:29] if God blesses
[2:16:32] don't even say when God blesses
[2:16:35] say God is blessing
[2:16:37] God is multiplying God is breathing on
[2:16:41] it God's gonna give him so much business
[2:16:44] that he has to hire this one and that
[2:16:47] one and the other one
[2:16:49] [Applause]
[2:16:51] God's Gonna bless him so they don't have
[2:16:53] to borrow real to beg somebody else's
[2:16:56] equipment
[2:17:01] we can bring ourselves into alignment
[2:17:06] in the night the Lord woke me up last
[2:17:08] night in the night and he began to talk
[2:17:10] to me about something I want to share
[2:17:12] this with you real quick it's not the
[2:17:14] message but it kind of fits in right
[2:17:16] here I want you to be very careful what
[2:17:19] you say over your children I want you to
[2:17:22] be very careful what you say over your
[2:17:25] grandchildren
[2:17:27] very very careful because the spirit of
[2:17:29] the Lord woke me up
[2:17:31] and was talking to me in my spirit about
[2:17:35] something like this
[2:17:37] be very very careful
[2:17:40] don't say he's clumsy
[2:17:49] don't say he's socially challenged
[2:17:55] don't say she's socially
[2:18:00] and and here's where we really really
[2:18:02] seeing
[2:18:05] we say like me
[2:18:10] what kind of mom and daddy are we
[2:18:13] we want our children to be awkward
[2:18:16] because we've been awkward
[2:18:18] I'm just going to come down here and
[2:18:19] Pastor a while
[2:18:21] we want our children to be awkward
[2:18:23] because we're awkward
[2:18:25] you see first of all I don't believe in
[2:18:27] introverts and extroverts I don't
[2:18:28] believe in them I don't even believe in
[2:18:31] them
[2:18:32] so when I hear people describing
[2:18:33] themselves as such I don't even believe
[2:18:35] them
[2:18:36] I believe it's absolutely something that
[2:18:39] somebody made up
[2:18:42] and it has become an excuse
[2:18:46] for our own awkwardness or lack of
[2:18:49] and I think that what we what we do we
[2:18:52] we Embark with our words we don't
[2:18:54] understand the power and the authority
[2:18:56] of our words
[2:18:58] and for me to say over my son he's going
[2:19:01] to be an introvert like me she's going
[2:19:03] to be an introvert like me that one's
[2:19:05] going to be an extrovert like me why in
[2:19:08] the don't you have anything else to talk
[2:19:10] about
[2:19:11] [Music]
[2:19:13] it's like we project our fears on our
[2:19:16] children
[2:19:19] we're not going to do such a thing like
[2:19:21] that as we come into the fullness of
[2:19:23] recognizing Who We Are
[2:19:25] and if we realize the effect of our
[2:19:28] words in the negative we would also
[2:19:30] begin to discern the power and authority
[2:19:33] of our words in the positive and we
[2:19:35] would start speaking those things do you
[2:19:37] really want your children to be socially
[2:19:39] awkward because you've chosen to be
[2:19:47] you know God didn't make you socially
[2:19:48] awkward no no you've chosen to be that
[2:19:52] way somebody has reinforced the def your
[2:19:56] definition of who you are someone has
[2:19:58] reinforced that
[2:20:00] and you have chosen to do that let me
[2:20:02] tell you something God can call you out
[2:20:05] of your shell and some of you God needs
[2:20:07] to put you back where he got you yeah
[2:20:09] I'm kidding
[2:20:11] don't accept anything that you don't
[2:20:14] like
[2:20:16] anything that you don't think is from
[2:20:19] him don't you accept it because mama had
[2:20:21] it and Grandma had it
[2:20:28] when I was young I really really
[2:20:32] suffered with ulcers in my mouth
[2:20:36] and they eventually manifested in my
[2:20:39] stomach
[2:20:40] and I was just a young boy in ninth
[2:20:42] grade of high school when they got so
[2:20:44] bad that I woke up every morning with a
[2:20:47] sour stomach I vomited every morning of
[2:20:50] my life
[2:20:51] and my mouth was so full of ulcers that
[2:20:54] I lived at the dentist's office with
[2:20:57] taking all kinds of different treatments
[2:20:59] and they cauterized them with a with a
[2:21:02] with a cauterizing Rod because they
[2:21:04] would get so bad and so big inside my
[2:21:08] mouth that to open my mouth was painful
[2:21:10] to eat was painful to talk was painful
[2:21:13] and lately those things have been
[2:21:15] manifesting in Joshua's mouth and some
[2:21:18] of you know a couple weeks ago he had to
[2:21:21] go to the doctor because his got so bad
[2:21:23] in his mouth that he could hardly stand
[2:21:25] the pain and lately Olivia has been
[2:21:27] complaining about having those things
[2:21:28] well I've been talking to God about that
[2:21:30] on the beach
[2:21:31] I'm just giving you an example I've been
[2:21:34] talking to God about it
[2:21:36] and I didn't like him and God delivered
[2:21:38] me he delivered me every now and then I
[2:21:42] might have a little sore inside my mouth
[2:21:44] or on my tongue but very rare and
[2:21:47] nothing like what I used to have you
[2:21:50] could you I have scars now I have scars
[2:21:54] in my mouth hard places in my mouth
[2:21:56] where I've had really bad ones that
[2:21:58] healed up and they got hard but I've
[2:22:00] been going down that beach talking to
[2:22:01] the Lord and I've been saying just
[2:22:03] because I had him doesn't mean Joshua
[2:22:06] has to suffer just because I had him
[2:22:08] doesn't mean Olivia has to have them
[2:22:12] my wife's mother had migraine headaches
[2:22:15] that doesn't mean my wife has to fight
[2:22:16] my green head do you understand where
[2:22:18] I'm coming from now
[2:22:20] [Music]
[2:22:21] well I was a clumsy child so that's why
[2:22:23] my child Falls all over his own feet
[2:22:26] you don't have to believe such a thing
[2:22:28] as that
[2:22:29] I hope I don't sound like a quack what
[2:22:32] I'm trying to tell you is what the Lord
[2:22:33] woke me up he just woke me up
[2:22:40] be careful what you say over your
[2:22:42] children
[2:22:45] you're mean as a snake you really want
[2:22:47] to say such a thing like that
[2:22:51] help me I'm getting some help here
[2:22:53] you don't want to say anything like that
[2:22:55] let me tell you something any true
[2:22:57] person who struggles with being awkward
[2:23:01] and we all have struggled with being
[2:23:02] awkward at one time or another in life
[2:23:04] but anybody who really has battled that
[2:23:07] in their life would never
[2:23:10] ever want their children
[2:23:15] now if you need quotes I can get them
[2:23:18] I preached how many do you reckon I
[2:23:20] preached a whole year on the mind
[2:23:23] two years
[2:23:25] I probably preached two years on the
[2:23:27] mind and I've got quotes that'll run out
[2:23:30] your ears and nose
[2:23:32] I've got Caroline Leaf quotes and I've
[2:23:35] got brother Brandon quotes and I I can
[2:23:37] show you the neurologist and all and and
[2:23:39] and we can talk about all that
[2:23:41] neuroplasticity and and what brother
[2:23:43] greedy was getting into the other night
[2:23:47] so and and in fact it all ties right
[2:23:51] back to the word
[2:23:52] because you're fearfully and wonderfully
[2:23:54] made in the mind of a great creator
[2:23:57] and so I don't want to talk about this
[2:23:59] very long but I I it came to me because
[2:24:01] I walked straight up out of a dead
[2:24:03] sleeve and I thought how am I going to
[2:24:05] make that how am I going to work that in
[2:24:07] what what the Lord was already kind of
[2:24:09] laying on my heart but he just gave me
[2:24:10] the moment he just opened it up nobody
[2:24:13] who struggles with something like that
[2:24:14] wants her children to struggle
[2:24:17] so quit saying things like that
[2:24:19] now there is a kind of a spirit that can
[2:24:22] get on somebody where they get to
[2:24:24] feeling like their safety and numbers
[2:24:27] and they'll start putting on putting
[2:24:29] that on those around them for instance a
[2:24:31] mother who's afraid of the water can
[2:24:32] sometimes put that on their children
[2:24:34] because it gives them a little bit of a
[2:24:36] sense of of of being normal
[2:24:43] we feel a little more normal oh CCC she
[2:24:46] see he no no no no no no no no no no
[2:24:50] let me tell you who you are you're the
[2:24:52] wife of Jesus Christ
[2:24:54] you're the Lamb's bride
[2:24:56] I I don't care if the whole world around
[2:24:59] you is is
[2:25:02] you don't have to be
[2:25:08] have a nervous breakdown you don't have
[2:25:09] to have one
[2:25:11] come on now
[2:25:13] well I just get so awkward I just can't
[2:25:15] even say my name practice get in the
[2:25:18] mirror
[2:25:21] get in the bear and say my name is
[2:25:23] Stephen Shelley my name is Stephen
[2:25:25] Shelley my name is Steve until you
[2:25:28] believe it
[2:25:32] isn't that what brother Brandon said
[2:25:34] about heel being healed he said just say
[2:25:35] it or no I'm Healed I am healed I am
[2:25:37] healed I'm Healed I am healed I'm Healed
[2:25:39] I am healed I'm here I'm here
[2:25:44] until you believe it
[2:25:46] and once you believe it it's there it's
[2:25:48] done
[2:25:49] don't you let the enemy accuse you and
[2:25:53] use something that you're not even
[2:25:55] guilty of to block you to get between
[2:25:59] you and your joy you and your blessing
[2:26:02] you and your
[2:26:03] [Music]
[2:26:05] don't say if
[2:26:07] if God heals her
[2:26:11] if God heals me
[2:26:14] if God blesses a business if God helps
[2:26:19] me overcome if I can get above myself if
[2:26:23] I can get myself straightened out if I
[2:26:25] can
[2:26:29] now I told my wife this two days ago
[2:26:33] be three days ago now
[2:26:36] I had already taken my three mile walk
[2:26:39] on the beach I'm getting somewhere
[2:26:42] between six and eight miles a day but
[2:26:44] three miles barefooted on the beach now
[2:26:47] you're talking about somebody who has
[2:26:49] spent the last three years hurting
[2:26:52] from the bed to the bathroom
[2:26:55] now it's the truth my wife leaves with
[2:26:57] me pain in my legs my sciatic nerve
[2:27:00] numbness
[2:27:02] my leg my whole leg going numb
[2:27:05] don't mean to be plain but even going to
[2:27:07] the bathroom and being so numb all the
[2:27:10] way down afraid that I'm gonna be a mess
[2:27:13] wet myself because that sciatic nerve
[2:27:16] pressed and it was so numb I couldn't
[2:27:18] even you know feel
[2:27:20] and for God to give me the strength and
[2:27:23] help me and bless me to be able to do
[2:27:25] what I've been doing the last few weeks
[2:27:27] is for me miraculous and I'm giving him
[2:27:31] the praise
[2:27:32] this particular day I walked the three
[2:27:34] miles in the sand barefooted which is
[2:27:37] harder anyway
[2:27:39] I've had both feet operated on
[2:27:42] my achilles tendon was almost completely
[2:27:45] severed and it's it's was sewed back
[2:27:48] together and walking on the sand any of
[2:27:51] you that have ever been with me where
[2:27:53] they were saying you know I have had
[2:27:54] terrible problems walking in the sand
[2:27:57] because it's so unstable but I knew that
[2:28:01] this was my time
[2:28:02] I knew it and God has helped me so so I
[2:28:05] I come back sat there for a few hours
[2:28:07] read and rested and relaxed and I
[2:28:09] thought you know what I'm gonna get up
[2:28:11] and do one more mile real quick I know
[2:28:12] exactly where the half mile Mark is I'm
[2:28:15] going to go down that beach half mile
[2:28:16] and come back and the next day I felt
[2:28:20] good when I got back the next day I
[2:28:22] started my walk and I was hurting all
[2:28:24] over
[2:28:26] and I thought well maybe that that
[2:28:28] little bit of extra maybe I shouldn't
[2:28:30] have maybe I should have done a half
[2:28:31] mile instead of home all the reasoning
[2:28:33] trying to figure it out but the pain was
[2:28:35] back and it was back with a with a
[2:28:37] Vengeance and I thought I'm going to
[2:28:39] have to sit down here
[2:28:40] and and uh what am I going to do because
[2:28:43] there's no way to even get to me
[2:28:44] I couldn't get nobody to come help me
[2:28:46] because there's no access it's a it's a
[2:28:49] a stretch of Dunes where there's no
[2:28:51] beach access and I thought how what in
[2:28:53] the world am I going to do I sat down on
[2:28:55] the sand and I rolled my hip around on
[2:28:58] the sand until it popped and once it
[2:29:01] popped I was able to get up and and walk
[2:29:04] on back and it began to make me mad
[2:29:10] you've got to get this way in line I
[2:29:12] know I'm using myself as an example here
[2:29:14] but it's just to show you how the enemy
[2:29:16] will work on me just like it work on you
[2:29:18] and every step oh ow ow there was one
[2:29:23] period of time literally I thought I
[2:29:24] hope nobody I'm glad nobody's seeing me
[2:29:26] I hope nobody's seeing me with the
[2:29:27] binoculars
[2:29:30] because I was literally this but I said
[2:29:32] I'm not gonna stop no no no no no no no
[2:29:34] no no no no
[2:29:36] the Lord is healing me
[2:29:39] the Lord is strengthening me the Lord is
[2:29:43] helping me
[2:29:44] the devil said you'll be in the bed
[2:29:46] tomorrow you won't be able to walk
[2:29:47] you'll have to have your cane you want
[2:29:48] me to get around he talks to me too
[2:29:51] and you know what I just talked right
[2:29:53] back to him you're a liar and the father
[2:29:55] of all lies
[2:29:57] Hallelujah
[2:30:00] and I pressed my way just like you have
[2:30:02] to press your way through whatever the
[2:30:04] enemy is throwing at you it's it's our
[2:30:06] everyday Affair but here's what I gotta
[2:30:09] close
[2:30:10] I gotta close here in a minute
[2:30:13] but here's what I want to say to you
[2:30:17] oh my
[2:30:19] I don't like skipping
[2:30:23] you want to make sure let me just stop
[2:30:25] I'm going to summarize hearing for a
[2:30:26] moment and close
[2:30:28] you've got to make sure that the enemy
[2:30:30] doesn't have a legal right to hold
[2:30:31] something
[2:30:32] that's yours
[2:30:35] because
[2:30:36] let me show you this
[2:30:39] let me give you this verse real quick if
[2:30:41] you have to slip out thank you so much
[2:30:43] for being here
[2:30:45] we're so happy you're here
[2:30:47] let me let me give you Revelation 19 11
[2:30:49] real quick
[2:30:51] I want you to see this
[2:30:56] and I saw heaven opened
[2:30:58] and behold a white horse
[2:31:00] and he that sat upon him was called
[2:31:02] faithful and true and in righteousness
[2:31:05] he doth
[2:31:06] judge and make war
[2:31:09] I want you to notice when he comes in
[2:31:12] the second coming this is the second
[2:31:14] coming
[2:31:15] and when he comes in the second coming
[2:31:17] this will be his Priority First he will
[2:31:20] judge
[2:31:22] then he will make war
[2:31:24] and when I hear that it speaks to me
[2:31:27] and it tells me that it is a part of his
[2:31:31] inerrant nature
[2:31:33] to judge
[2:31:36] he is a judge
[2:31:38] if I had time I would go to Daniel I did
[2:31:41] this with the church in 2020
[2:31:44] . did you all realize
[2:31:47] that we are in the weak right now right
[2:31:51] now this is the week
[2:31:53] that begin to change everything we'd
[2:31:55] known
[2:31:56] about the normalcy of our life
[2:32:00] three years ago this week
[2:32:02] things begin to change our our normal
[2:32:05] way of going to a restaurant
[2:32:08] our normal way we were away at sister
[2:32:11] Carol kinser's funeral and we were being
[2:32:13] told
[2:32:15] that we might not be able to cross the
[2:32:17] border
[2:32:19] to come out of Virginia
[2:32:22] we were being told that week the news
[2:32:25] was beginning to report that people were
[2:32:27] being stopped at the border of Florida
[2:32:28] and if they couldn't if they couldn't
[2:32:30] show citizenship they would they would
[2:32:33] not be allowed to pass into Florida now
[2:32:35] the truth is that began to get out early
[2:32:37] and it wasn't in fact the case but just
[2:32:40] a few weeks later
[2:32:42] the things that we were beginning to
[2:32:44] hear so when we left Virginia that day
[2:32:46] we really wondered what kind of problems
[2:32:48] we would have restaurants that were open
[2:32:50] on the way up were shut down on the way
[2:32:53] back live as we as we had known it
[2:32:56] really begin to shift
[2:33:00] [Music]
[2:33:04] and God gave us a message
[2:33:08] and the message was I am giving a Divine
[2:33:13] reset
[2:33:18] I am giving my people an opportunity
[2:33:22] while things are being reset around them
[2:33:26] I'm giving them an opportunity to be
[2:33:29] spiritually realigned and reset with the
[2:33:33] purposes of Heaven
[2:33:34] come on now
[2:33:36] and even though the season has passed
[2:33:39] and and did you know that they are
[2:33:42] anticipating that in May of this year
[2:33:45] they are going to announce the World
[2:33:47] Health Organization is going to announce
[2:33:49] in May of this year not now not March
[2:33:52] not April but in May of this year
[2:33:55] they're going to make the official
[2:33:56] declaration
[2:33:58] that the pandemic is over
[2:34:01] it's not official
[2:34:04] but in me it's going to be official
[2:34:08] they're going to schedule it
[2:34:13] you remember the spirit of God knows
[2:34:15] what the hearts of men don't know
[2:34:18] remember that we were Hearing in the
[2:34:20] news a few weeks after we were Hearing
[2:34:23] in the news that this was a disease that
[2:34:26] had come out of wet markets
[2:34:29] and the spirit of the Lord's right there
[2:34:31] spoke over this church and said this
[2:34:34] came out of a Lab
[2:34:38] yes
[2:34:39] yes this wasn't something out of a wet
[2:34:42] Market this was something that escaped
[2:34:44] and it had been even manipulated by man
[2:34:48] foreign
[2:34:49] and now what is the talk now
[2:34:53] they're they're bringing they're talking
[2:34:55] about bringing some of the men who
[2:34:56] argued that that down to to Justice
[2:34:59] they're talking about making them pay
[2:35:01] for their crime
[2:35:02] [Music]
[2:35:03] you know if you just listen to the Holy
[2:35:06] Spirit
[2:35:08] then you won't have to Panic or be
[2:35:10] paranoid
[2:35:12] you know we haven't really taken the
[2:35:14] time in a long time to thank God how he
[2:35:16] brought us through how many of y'all
[2:35:18] shouldn't we just take a moment
[2:35:20] [Applause]
[2:35:22] shouldn't we just take a moment to thank
[2:35:24] God how he brought us through
[2:35:26] [Applause]
[2:35:30] really God's been good to this church
[2:35:36] very few Services did we miss
[2:35:41] very few Services did we miss
[2:35:44] [Applause]
[2:35:46] he was so good to us
[2:35:51] let us not lose our opportunity
[2:35:56] to realign ourselves
[2:35:59] even now
[2:36:01] with the purposes of God
[2:36:07] first he judges then he makes War judge
[2:36:10] judges speak directly of judicial
[2:36:12] activity this requires a hearing of the
[2:36:15] evidence and then the rendering of a
[2:36:17] decision and a verdict I want you to
[2:36:19] know that it is a part of the inherent
[2:36:21] nature of God to be a judge it is a part
[2:36:24] of who he is a judging is not what he
[2:36:28] does a judge is who he is
[2:36:32] and when we think about a judge we think
[2:36:34] about we think about one who's ready to
[2:36:36] just Crown the Earth with judgment
[2:36:39] but we must understand that part are you
[2:36:42] still with me
[2:36:43] just a few more minutes we must
[2:36:45] understand that a part of his
[2:36:47] responsibility and who he is is not just
[2:36:50] to to bring judgment on the unrighteous
[2:36:53] but it's also a part of who he is to
[2:36:56] render Justice
[2:36:59] on behalf of the righteous
[2:37:03] and I saw some situations in the spirit
[2:37:05] while I was away
[2:37:07] that had been manipulated
[2:37:10] by the Enemy by the Accuser
[2:37:13] I saw some situations where the enemy
[2:37:16] had stood between certain people and
[2:37:18] what was rightfully theirs by the
[2:37:20] Kingdom Purpose of God
[2:37:23] and it'll make you mad enough to choke
[2:37:24] the devil
[2:37:26] to think that he would get between you
[2:37:29] and what God
[2:37:31] somebody said I don't even know if that
[2:37:32] kind of thing happens read Daniel
[2:37:34] chapter 10.
[2:37:36] Daniel Prayed in the minute that God
[2:37:38] prayed God sent an angel to give to give
[2:37:41] Daniel the answer but he got in the
[2:37:43] second heaven and the Prince of Persia
[2:37:46] withstood the angel of the Lord
[2:37:48] and they wrestled there in the heavens
[2:37:50] for days they wrestled in the second
[2:37:53] heavens for days until Lord Michael
[2:37:55] until the Prince Michael
[2:38:03] said wait a minute
[2:38:06] this can't go on like this
[2:38:08] and he came down into the second heaven
[2:38:11] and and and kicked
[2:38:16] I'm going to be clean
[2:38:22] temptation is there to be Raw
[2:38:26] but he kicked them
[2:38:35] you know picked that angel up and said
[2:38:37] now go do what I've sent you to do
[2:38:40] Daniel is weak
[2:38:43] he has fasted he has prayed he has
[2:38:46] travailed he's wondering if God even
[2:38:48] cares
[2:38:51] and all of a sudden one day the angel
[2:38:53] shows up
[2:38:56] steps into the room Daniel's falling
[2:38:58] around he's so weak
[2:39:00] oh don't worry about it Daniel
[2:39:04] take courage get up and get ready
[2:39:07] your prayer was heard the first day you
[2:39:11] prayed
[2:39:13] so don't you tell me that the enemy
[2:39:15] doesn't Delight in getting between
[2:39:18] people and their promise
[2:39:20] in getting between people and their
[2:39:21] blessing
[2:39:23] they're healing their Joy their
[2:39:26] prosperity he Delights in standing
[2:39:29] between you and your victory
[2:39:32] but in the spirit I begin to see
[2:39:35] that prayers were being offered
[2:39:39] and I don't mean now I lay me down to
[2:39:42] sleep prayers
[2:39:44] it's all right that's good prayer do it
[2:39:46] but I mean strategic prayers
[2:39:49] prayers that called and pleaded the case
[2:39:53] before the Ancient of Days the righteous
[2:39:56] judge of all
[2:39:57] and and and it it came in such a way
[2:40:01] that the judge could not help he he
[2:40:04] could not refuse
[2:40:07] the petition
[2:40:09] because the petition was made based on
[2:40:13] the blood
[2:40:17] there's no higher price
[2:40:20] the blood of Jesus
[2:40:22] Bobby Conner said one time to us he said
[2:40:27] there's going to be a greater Revelation
[2:40:29] and understanding of the appropriation
[2:40:31] of the blood than what the church has
[2:40:34] ever had before
[2:40:36] and I believe it I believe I've seen
[2:40:38] some of it in the spirit
[2:40:40] because all this arguing that goes on in
[2:40:43] the courtroom of Eternity all this
[2:40:45] arguing and going on and the enemy
[2:40:47] standing there making his case about why
[2:40:50] you don't deserve right
[2:40:54] now and if and some of what he says is
[2:40:56] true and that's why you and I have a
[2:40:58] responsibility to keep the dead cats off
[2:41:00] the line and walk in a state of
[2:41:02] repentance and I want to tell you
[2:41:04] something if you struggle with saying
[2:41:06] you're sorry you got bigger problems
[2:41:08] than that
[2:41:14] it's hard time that some of us
[2:41:16] apologized and made right
[2:41:20] some of the things we've done and gotten
[2:41:22] by with
[2:41:23] anybody with me
[2:41:25] it's hot time that we've made it right
[2:41:28] before God you could shut down your
[2:41:32] accuser
[2:41:34] you you could cause him to have to stand
[2:41:36] speedless speechless before the judge
[2:41:39] because there's nothing else to be said
[2:41:43] because you've repented and you've cried
[2:41:46] out to God and you've gone to your
[2:41:47] brother and you've gone to your sister
[2:41:49] and you've gotten it right
[2:41:51] and so now he just
[2:41:55] the judge says what is the accusation
[2:41:58] and normally the great sophist would
[2:42:01] just open his mouth and he would just
[2:42:03] begin to eloquently spew out all the
[2:42:05] things that you did wrong the way you
[2:42:07] didn't treat your wife right the way you
[2:42:08] didn't treat your children right the way
[2:42:10] you cheated on your job the way you took
[2:42:12] the stapler home that didn't belong to
[2:42:14] you
[2:42:17] hey come on
[2:42:20] you'll just but now it's all been made
[2:42:22] right it's all been confessed and the
[2:42:24] blood you'd be surprised what the blood
[2:42:26] calls into the courtroom
[2:42:29] when that blood is pleaded
[2:42:32] when the great defense attorney of all
[2:42:35] times
[2:42:39] there is no argument he never has to
[2:42:41] argue on on your behalf all he has to do
[2:42:44] is plead the blood
[2:42:47] there is no accusation that can stand
[2:42:49] against the power of the blood of Jesus
[2:42:51] Christ it silences the enemy as long as
[2:42:54] you've made everything right that needs
[2:42:55] to be made right I encourage you in this
[2:42:57] hour I don't have time to ground this
[2:42:58] today I don't have time to land the
[2:43:00] plane today even
[2:43:02] but I encourage you to go out of here
[2:43:04] seeking the Lord for any area of your
[2:43:07] life that the enemy may actually be
[2:43:09] telling the truth about you before the
[2:43:11] throne
[2:43:13] because in any place where the enemy is
[2:43:16] telling the truth about you
[2:43:23] watch this
[2:43:25] even the blood
[2:43:28] thank you
[2:43:30] even the blood can't free you
[2:43:38] Heaven is a place of order
[2:43:40] that other realm that that courtroom of
[2:43:43] justice is a place of of divine order
[2:43:45] and and there is a there is a a
[2:43:48] precedent there is a protocol that takes
[2:43:52] place
[2:43:53] if you've ever been in a trial if you've
[2:43:55] ever been a juror if you've ever watched
[2:43:58] a trial you you will know uh you know
[2:44:01] how things operate you hear the
[2:44:03] attorneys before they start spewing uh
[2:44:06] many especially older uh more
[2:44:09] old-fashioned attorneys will say always
[2:44:12] before they start talking may it please
[2:44:13] the court of course it pleases the court
[2:44:15] we just called on you
[2:44:18] but there's a protocol that says may it
[2:44:20] please the court
[2:44:21] it just it just
[2:44:25] it's like some of you have seen sister
[2:44:27] Flo leave a service sometime of course
[2:44:29] she had to go out and at times she's
[2:44:30] done like this just just
[2:44:33] respect
[2:44:35] it's not necessary
[2:44:37] but it's just an expression of respect
[2:44:40] that I may be distracting but it's
[2:44:42] important for me I got to go out
[2:44:45] so I can show at least or you might see
[2:44:47] somebody you know Crouch down a little
[2:44:49] bit not that they become invisible when
[2:44:51] they bow their head
[2:44:54] but it's just you know it's just a
[2:44:56] little protocol to say hey I realize
[2:44:58] that I I may be distracting but I
[2:45:00] I got to get up to the parking lot
[2:45:04] I gotta get to the back and and if you
[2:45:07] think there's protocol for how things
[2:45:08] operate here you you ought to begin to
[2:45:11] just uh catch a glimpse of how things
[2:45:14] operate in his great court of justice
[2:45:17] and if you think the devil Just Dances
[2:45:20] around
[2:45:21] like like Mr fancy pants
[2:45:26] you'd be surprised at your enemy
[2:45:34] you know he is the the Imp
[2:45:37] that responds to Blue Devil
[2:45:41] he prances when he has an opportunity in
[2:45:43] boast when he has a chance but he gets
[2:45:46] in the presence of that Divine judge and
[2:45:48] I want you to know he's business
[2:45:50] his business
[2:45:53] he's straight to the point
[2:45:56] and if he lays one accusation before
[2:45:59] that judge that has already been
[2:46:02] repented of and covered by the blood I
[2:46:05] want you to know in in a in a in a New
[2:46:09] York Minute
[2:46:13] the objection comes and the blood is
[2:46:17] planned
[2:46:22] settled
[2:46:24] and if that devil should go back to try
[2:46:27] to talk about that again
[2:46:28] [Music]
[2:46:30] order in this court
[2:46:35] you cannot bring before me any matter
[2:46:38] that has already been covered by the
[2:46:41] blood of the Lamb of God think about it
[2:46:46] so the enemy finally begins to run out
[2:46:49] of things that he can say to get between
[2:46:51] you and the case
[2:46:57] you want to make sure there's nothing
[2:46:58] standing there you're still with me
[2:47:00] we're closing we're closing we're
[2:47:03] closing deep calleth under the Deep
[2:47:06] we're closing pitch your neighbor
[2:47:15] tell him to sleep at lunch
[2:47:19] wake up now
[2:47:21] paragraph 98 thou Spirit of the devil
[2:47:25] that has bound my brother
[2:47:27] I charge thee by Jesus Christ the son of
[2:47:31] God who come to this earth and fought
[2:47:34] principalities and Rob Satan and you
[2:47:37] have no legal right to hold him anymore
[2:47:41] why
[2:47:43] because the blood
[2:47:48] now if you've not repented
[2:47:51] the blood is available
[2:47:54] but it doesn't cry out on your behalf
[2:48:02] service after service after service
[2:48:04] after service I begged them
[2:48:07] to repent
[2:48:11] I took a quote from the church age book
[2:48:17] or brother Branham said sometimes we
[2:48:19] just scream out I'm sorry
[2:48:22] hello
[2:48:25] and I begged them and I begged them
[2:48:32] the whole mind series was inspired by a
[2:48:36] spirit that I was having to battle
[2:48:43] in 2020 just a few weeks from now just a
[2:48:46] few weeks from now three years ago
[2:48:49] he gave me a message for them
[2:48:56] when the strong man meets the strong
[2:48:58] angel
[2:49:01] you go back and look over that series of
[2:49:04] sermons you go back and look at titles
[2:49:06] just titles
[2:49:08] and you'll hear that the spirit of God
[2:49:11] was crying out over and over and over
[2:49:14] again
[2:49:15] you don't have to come to the altar you
[2:49:18] don't have to make a public statement
[2:49:21] stand at your seat and cry out to God
[2:49:24] I'm so
[2:49:29] it's it's where it starts
[2:49:32] it's where we start
[2:49:34] repositioning ourselves just say yes
[2:49:37] even I am capable of error foreign
[2:49:47] no man no woman is infallible we have
[2:49:52] the need to keep coming back and saying
[2:49:55] Lord I'm sorry I miss this
[2:49:58] and when we do that the enemy has no
[2:50:02] legal rights to hold us anymore but when
[2:50:07] we refuse to repent and make right what
[2:50:11] we have done the enemy stands as our
[2:50:15] accuser and the problem is he stands
[2:50:17] between us and the victory
[2:50:22] so our whole lives has to be turned
[2:50:25] upside down and right all topsy-turvy
[2:50:29] and everything around us have to shift
[2:50:31] just so that God can begin to speak to
[2:50:33] our hearts and say when you when your
[2:50:36] case is heard you don't want the enemy
[2:50:38] to be able to say a word
[2:50:41] when he opens his mouth you want the
[2:50:43] blood to cry out
[2:50:44] shut him up every time are you with me
[2:50:46] let's go on and finish this one he said
[2:50:48] and we stand under the commission of
[2:50:50] Jesus Christ said they shall cast out
[2:50:52] devils and come out of the man in the
[2:50:54] name of Jesus Christ leave him he said
[2:50:58] can you hear me can you hear me now and
[2:51:00] this can you hear me now say Amen the
[2:51:02] brother says amen
[2:51:03] say Amen the brother says amen all right
[2:51:06] you may raise your head and look this
[2:51:08] way
[2:51:09] the man I didn't know how deaf he was
[2:51:11] just the deaf Spirit like a dark cold
[2:51:13] Shadow go like that moving to him now he
[2:51:17] has perfect hearing now
[2:51:22] why because the enemy had lost his legal
[2:51:24] rights
[2:51:25] listen just a moment come here I'm going
[2:51:27] to whisper real low this microphone
[2:51:28] verse sends it and brother Branham goes
[2:51:30] through I love the Lord yeah I love the
[2:51:31] Lord glory to God and the brother says
[2:51:33] glory to God and he says I'm whispering
[2:51:35] he said see this
[2:51:38] I'm going to put my hand over the
[2:51:40] microphone you won't hear it just me
[2:51:41] praise the Lord the brother continues to
[2:51:42] repeat and respond to what brother Adam
[2:51:44] says now I'm just barely Whispering
[2:51:46] listen to this
[2:51:47] can you hear me all right hear me now
[2:51:49] sir I can hear you playing yes
[2:51:52] now watch can you hear me now yes I can
[2:51:54] hear you playing amen God bless you
[2:51:56] you're healed my brother
[2:51:58] now look at this last next sentence he
[2:52:00] said now see watch the disease now if
[2:52:04] the man keeps believing that'll never
[2:52:07] come to him again something had given
[2:52:12] that demon a legal right
[2:52:15] to take that man's hearing
[2:52:19] and when that legal right was dealt with
[2:52:22] and repentance came
[2:52:24] that enemy could not stay
[2:52:27] he had to go and as long as that man
[2:52:29] kept believing and walking in faith that
[2:52:31] devil could never come back
[2:52:33] and hinder him again does that help
[2:52:35] anybody it sure does help me
[2:52:37] it sure does help me
[2:52:39] now let me give you another one speak to
[2:52:41] this rock
[2:52:42] and I know we got to go
[2:52:46] the devil hates me and I know he hates
[2:52:48] you too you just might as well know that
[2:52:50] you just might as well be settled on
[2:52:51] that the devil hates you
[2:52:53] I know you like for everybody to like
[2:52:55] you
[2:52:57] but the devil don't like you he hates
[2:52:59] you you represent to him everything that
[2:53:03] he wants
[2:53:05] and will never have
[2:53:07] the devil hates me and I know he hates
[2:53:09] you too and he's he's my enemy but as
[2:53:12] long as God's my friend I don't have no
[2:53:14] fear of him
[2:53:15] I just drive him right on back take the
[2:53:18] word of God and move him right on back
[2:53:19] out of his out of the place that he
[2:53:21] thinks he's aholden he hasn't got no
[2:53:23] strongholds he's absolutely legally
[2:53:26] defeated in every place
[2:53:28] the devil hasn't got one legal right at
[2:53:32] all nowhere he's just a devil and a
[2:53:35] password that's all he hasn't got no
[2:53:37] legal right to any man that'll accept
[2:53:39] the promise of Jesus Christ he's wept
[2:53:42] yes sir he swept in sickness he swept in
[2:53:45] disappointment he swept in everything he
[2:53:48] Swift in death he can't scare me he
[2:53:50] can't scare you that's all he is is a
[2:53:53] big old Shadow hear him
[2:53:55] he said so he just might as well get on
[2:53:57] down the street I've just seen his red
[2:53:59] light go over a hill a while ago did you
[2:54:03] another man said the last time I saw the
[2:54:04] devil he was going over the hill the red
[2:54:06] light of his
[2:54:09] gone yes sir all right praise the Lord I
[2:54:11] begin to feel pretty good now
[2:54:13] and he should
[2:54:15] now in closing you just said that yeah
[2:54:17] one more time
[2:54:19] well it would help us if you didn't keep
[2:54:20] saying that he probably would
[2:54:27] this is a long one or you got you've got
[2:54:29] 10 more minutes good
[2:54:33] you can't send me on vacation and then
[2:54:36] expect me to come back
[2:54:38] exhausted right
[2:54:41] you got to think I'm going to come back
[2:54:43] refreshed
[2:54:44] and if I come back refreshed I ought to
[2:54:46] preach all day
[2:54:50] and I know of at least a dozen to be
[2:54:52] here right maybe or not I think that was
[2:54:53] a little conservative you just stay
[2:54:55] right with me I know you would
[2:54:57] but I won't do that to you
[2:55:01] this is uh it's a long one
[2:55:06] it is uh now that's right
[2:55:10] now I read this
[2:55:12] to you all but I preached this series
[2:55:15] just before we started putting these
[2:55:17] screen these thoughts up on the screen
[2:55:19] the quotes on the screen
[2:55:22] I was so disappointed for charity when I
[2:55:25] realized that this long quote had not
[2:55:27] been put in because it was just a few
[2:55:29] weeks after this
[2:55:31] in 2020 that we started putting the
[2:55:34] the quotes on the screen
[2:55:37] now stay with me
[2:55:39] and that night after speaking brother
[2:55:41] Johnson came to me and said brother
[2:55:43] Branham
[2:55:44] said I want to tell you he said I told
[2:55:47] you I wouldn't ask you to pray for
[2:55:48] people
[2:55:50] and just several had accepted Christ and
[2:55:53] all down along we had them lay their
[2:55:55] hands up towards the windows and so
[2:55:57] forth that wanted to accept Jesus there
[2:55:59] except Christ there in New Albany that's
[2:56:02] New Albany Indiana he's in West Palm
[2:56:04] Beach Florida now
[2:56:06] he said and I said now that's all right
[2:56:08] what is it brother he said
[2:56:11] I got a Sunday school teacher here and
[2:56:15] he said she's a neurotic
[2:56:18] very lovely person but said she's
[2:56:21] nervousness has struck her and said
[2:56:24] she's been about eight years like that
[2:56:31] and said she's a lovely person
[2:56:35] would you if you'd go out towards the
[2:56:37] window and down them steps would you
[2:56:39] just lay your hands on her
[2:56:42] and I said sure
[2:56:44] so as I started out I went down towards
[2:56:47] the steps and they had the little woman
[2:56:49] down at the bottom of the steps I
[2:56:51] expected the way he explained her to see
[2:56:53] somebody in a straight jacket
[2:56:57] but a lovely nice looking clean little
[2:57:00] woman looked like standing there about
[2:57:02] 30 years old 32.
[2:57:05] and she said how do you do brother
[2:57:06] Branham
[2:57:08] I said are you the patient she said yes
[2:57:11] I said what's the matter sister she said
[2:57:13] I don't know brother Branham
[2:57:15] I laid hands over on her and asked God
[2:57:19] to heal her eight years now she's been
[2:57:22] out of her head
[2:57:24] she she said she just couldn't she she
[2:57:27] just prayed she couldn't get away from
[2:57:29] the place there she was scared to death
[2:57:31] all the time
[2:57:33] and she said I've been going over to the
[2:57:36] psychiatrist and taking treatments over
[2:57:39] there mental treatments
[2:57:43] and said it cost ten dollars a time how
[2:57:46] much you think that cost today
[2:57:48] it's in the 50s I'd say it cost a whole
[2:57:50] lot more than ten dollars a a treatment
[2:57:52] and folks it could very well be that
[2:57:56] this was electoral therapy shock
[2:57:58] treatments
[2:58:00] because that is what they were doing for
[2:58:03] people who needed to be reset mentally
[2:58:05] they shocked them sometimes doing so
[2:58:09] much physical damage
[2:58:12] that even if the person got mental help
[2:58:15] they were physically left handicapped
[2:58:18] because of the electric shock that went
[2:58:21] through their body
[2:58:24] I go sometimes two times a week
[2:58:28] and said I've been going for years and I
[2:58:30] just get worse all the time and I said
[2:58:32] well God bless you my sister and deliver
[2:58:35] you from that in the name of Jesus
[2:58:38] Christ now folks it looks like stay back
[2:58:42] it looks like that would be enough
[2:58:46] here is a prophet messenger sent from
[2:58:49] God
[2:58:51] saved by the blood filled with the Holy
[2:58:53] Ghost Sanctified by the word
[2:58:57] a success Ministry like none other
[2:59:03] tens of thousands of people healed
[2:59:06] doctors verified
[2:59:10] full of authority
[2:59:13] looks like all he'd have to do is say
[2:59:15] God bless you my sister and deliver you
[2:59:16] from that in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:59:18] look to me like it ought to be all right
[2:59:20] let's go on
[2:59:22] I went on about three days after that
[2:59:26] wife and I were in New Albany and here
[2:59:29] that little lady was on the street with
[2:59:31] another woman she was holding her hands
[2:59:33] like this and I said are you any better
[2:59:36] sister
[2:59:37] she started crying and she said brother
[2:59:41] Branham I'm even getting worse
[2:59:45] a little place there called the White
[2:59:47] House where the ladies do their shopping
[2:59:49] I stepped up in a little place there and
[2:59:52] asked prayer for her again
[2:59:57] so then here she come up in a couple
[2:59:59] days in a car
[3:00:02] they brought her up some women and they
[3:00:05] had to hold her up
[3:00:07] to keep her in the car
[3:00:10] to bring her up she was just screaming
[3:00:16] she was scared the world was going to
[3:00:19] burst with her
[3:00:21] and she was afraid
[3:00:24] she was walking on top of the earth and
[3:00:27] it was going to sink and oh all kinds of
[3:00:29] things you know how nervous people are
[3:00:31] so I had prayed for her again third time
[3:00:36] brother Branham has prayed for this
[3:00:39] woman and she said brother Branham when
[3:00:42] you have a meeting close again
[3:00:44] if I have to be
[3:00:47] put I want to come when that anointing
[3:00:50] is on you so I can said I believe that
[3:00:53] you pray for me when that anointing was
[3:00:55] on it would Cast Away that evil spirit
[3:00:58] from me
[3:01:00] I said are you a Christian
[3:01:03] you living above sin
[3:01:06] she said yes brother Brandon I'm a
[3:01:08] Sunday school teacher and I said well I
[3:01:10] pray that God will grant it
[3:01:13] and she got kind of to be a good friend
[3:01:15] with my wife calling her on the phone
[3:01:19] she said now if the angel of the Lord
[3:01:22] ever comes to brother Brandon while he's
[3:01:23] at home you call me sister Branham
[3:01:27] well one morning getting up after a
[3:01:29] powerful Vision well my wife said she
[3:01:32] said honey is it still present I said
[3:01:35] yes
[3:01:36] she said let me call that little woman
[3:01:39] from New Albany will you I said what
[3:01:42] little woman she said uh well that
[3:01:45] little woman is so awful nervous and
[3:01:47] said I feel so sorry for the little
[3:01:48] thing she's got three children
[3:01:51] and I said well call her
[3:01:54] so I went in and just a few minutes they
[3:01:56] brought her up and I said put her to
[3:01:58] herself over in the room he brought her
[3:02:01] there to the house
[3:02:03] and then there's a man come in from the
[3:02:05] Walnut Street Baptist Church in
[3:02:06] Louisville with cancer on the liver
[3:02:08] dying it's been about three years ago
[3:02:10] he's still living no trace of cancer
[3:02:12] just as normal as he can be and the
[3:02:14] doctor said his liver just dried up or
[3:02:16] got hard or something or another
[3:02:18] I don't know what it was he was just
[3:02:20] barely living he's a great strong
[3:02:21] healthy man many of you people that
[3:02:23] follow us from meetings to meetings will
[3:02:25] see him right in the meeting heard him
[3:02:27] testify so then I was in dealing with
[3:02:30] him and my wife come and said that
[3:02:33] little woman from New Albany they got
[3:02:35] her out there in the other room
[3:02:37] so I went in there to where she was she
[3:02:40] was and I said I want to see her by
[3:02:42] myself
[3:02:43] and so then when the anointing is on
[3:02:45] when when go you to talking to a person
[3:02:48] now watch when you go to a person that's
[3:02:51] when Vision starts you contact their
[3:02:53] Spirit like Jesus talking to the woman
[3:02:55] at the well he contacted her spirit and
[3:02:58] that's exactly right
[3:02:59] there's no great mysticism of that and
[3:03:02] then the vision takes place she said sit
[3:03:04] down there and I said how are you
[3:03:06] feeling she said brother Brandon I don't
[3:03:08] know
[3:03:09] she said I'm just about to go crazy
[3:03:12] she said I just don't know how I can't
[3:03:15] stand it any longer
[3:03:17] and I said now I want you to try to get
[3:03:19] quiet and just look here to me just a
[3:03:21] moment talk she said yes sir yes sir I'm
[3:03:23] doing the best that I can brother
[3:03:25] Branham like that
[3:03:26] very lovely little person and after
[3:03:28] talking to her a few minutes moments I
[3:03:31] seen a little black car going like that
[3:03:34] the vision left me
[3:03:36] I said did you ever have a car accident
[3:03:39] she said no sir I never did have a car
[3:03:42] accident I said there's something
[3:03:43] strange I've seen a little unseated
[3:03:45] black car in a running like that and she
[3:03:48] said no I never did have a car accident
[3:03:51] and then I went ahead talking to her
[3:03:54] here come again the vision broke and I
[3:03:56] seen her with a blonde-headed man
[3:03:59] and she was riding fast in the car and
[3:04:02] an automobile was going in a train just
[3:04:05] barely missed them
[3:04:07] and she started screaming
[3:04:09] I can hear her but I was still in the
[3:04:12] vision
[3:04:13] and She fainted and fell in the floor
[3:04:18] and here was the vision
[3:04:21] she was got married just before the war
[3:04:23] a young girl her husband went overseas
[3:04:26] and when he went overseas she started
[3:04:28] getting Lonesome and she started having
[3:04:30] company with a blonde headed boy just
[3:04:33] pause the moment
[3:04:36] now do you see the picture
[3:04:40] the Branham had prayed for her
[3:04:42] three times pronounced that that Spirit
[3:04:44] would have to leave her alone and now
[3:04:46] she she began to really to get her own a
[3:04:49] concept of how Deliverance would come
[3:04:51] when that anointing comes I want to be
[3:04:53] there
[3:04:55] and she made friends with sister random
[3:04:57] I just love that every time I read that
[3:04:59] I just think that's a smart woman
[3:05:01] she just figured now if I can just get
[3:05:03] in the family a little bit and make
[3:05:04] friends with sister then when that
[3:05:06] anointing I love that
[3:05:08] to me that's like ripping the roof off
[3:05:10] and letting him down that she she was
[3:05:12] after her help
[3:05:14] and uh so
[3:05:16] um
[3:05:17] started having company with a blonde
[3:05:19] headed boy let's read on and one night
[3:05:21] being out she broke her marriage vow
[3:05:24] and lived untrue to her husband on the
[3:05:27] road in the train almost struck them and
[3:05:31] killed them
[3:05:36] I'm so sorry I got so distracted because
[3:05:39] my mind went back to a similar
[3:05:42] circumstance elfrida is not here to
[3:05:45] verify but it reminded me of a of a of a
[3:05:48] very similar thing that happened in one
[3:05:50] of our services one time when a vision
[3:05:53] like that broke out for a man who was on
[3:05:55] the Stream
[3:05:57] I saw a train and he was going from
[3:06:00] place to place
[3:06:02] very strange that it come to my mind
[3:06:04] like that and and then when my wife
[3:06:07] heard her scream she'd come into the
[3:06:09] room we got her up she began to scream
[3:06:12] she said Oh Brother random don't you
[3:06:14] tell that to nobody don't you tell that
[3:06:15] to nobody
[3:06:17] I said there you are sister
[3:06:20] I said
[3:06:22] unconfessed sin
[3:06:26] now now when the house when it'll be
[3:06:28] quiet
[3:06:33] she said but I had
[3:06:36] she'd all different people coming on her
[3:06:38] and all and pray for her and stomp
[3:06:40] devils and kick devils
[3:06:43] and everything else but he stayed right
[3:06:46] there I said and he will stay right
[3:06:48] there as long as you got that
[3:06:50] unconfessed sin so let me just say your
[3:06:54] accuser will stand between you and your
[3:06:57] Victory as long as you've got something
[3:07:00] that has not been made right but you get
[3:07:03] rid of that you let the blood deal with
[3:07:06] that you do what God would allow you to
[3:07:09] do to make that thing right then you
[3:07:11] push the accuser out of the way and the
[3:07:13] blood cries out on your behalf and if he
[3:07:16] opens his mouth against you again the
[3:07:17] blood shuts him up
[3:07:23] you said brother Branham I listen
[3:07:26] I confess that to God
[3:07:35] I know there's a bunch of cheaters in
[3:07:37] here and you're already reading ahead of
[3:07:38] me again
[3:07:43] it wasn't God you sinned against
[3:07:46] it was your husband
[3:07:48] you got to make that right
[3:07:51] she said oh I'd break up my home I said
[3:07:54] that's all I can say lady
[3:07:56] there is the cause and until you make
[3:07:58] that right you'll never get any better
[3:08:04] that's way back in she said I don't even
[3:08:06] think of that
[3:08:08] I said no you don't
[3:08:11] but your subconscious is thinking of
[3:08:14] that read it
[3:08:18] I want to tell you something
[3:08:20] this gift was was a genius
[3:08:27] brother Branham
[3:08:29] not even a grammar school education
[3:08:34] no Deliverance schools no schools of the
[3:08:38] prophets no no no
[3:08:40] conferences to go and learn how to
[3:08:42] operate in these things Baptist
[3:08:50] and God used that gift
[3:08:55] and things he spoke about the mind and
[3:08:58] the brain and how Spirits work were not
[3:09:01] even considered to be true and accurate
[3:09:04] in the time that he spoke them but now
[3:09:10] you hear Dr Caroline Leaf saying that 25
[3:09:14] years ago when she started or 30 years
[3:09:17] ago she started in the research of the
[3:09:19] brain it was it was more commonly
[3:09:23] believed that the brain was fixed
[3:09:27] could never be repaired and you lived
[3:09:30] with the mind that you were born with
[3:09:35] can't change your IQ it's something
[3:09:37] you're born with and now all almost all
[3:09:42] brain scientists agree that through the
[3:09:45] miracle of neuroplasticity a person is
[3:09:49] able to rewire their brain and brother
[3:09:52] Brandon was preaching this in the 50s
[3:09:54] before it was ever that was a gift
[3:09:57] and you may get your little self all
[3:10:00] agitated with me for emphasizing that
[3:10:03] and I don't care
[3:10:08] I want to give honor where honor is due
[3:10:11] in a world of phonies
[3:10:15] in a world of flakes I want to tell you
[3:10:18] that somebody paid the prize
[3:10:22] and touched God and God used him because
[3:10:25] of it he's not he's not my my God he's
[3:10:29] my brother
[3:10:31] he's not to be worshiped he's to be
[3:10:33] heated
[3:10:35] we take everything he said and line it
[3:10:38] up with the scripture if we can't find
[3:10:40] it in the word we don't make some big
[3:10:42] Doctrine over it we just leave it what
[3:10:45] dovetails with that word we stand on
[3:10:48] that because we are thankful I'm
[3:10:50] thankful
[3:10:52] I hope I'm not sounding fanatical if I
[3:10:54] am okay
[3:10:55] no Psychiatry he said no you don't but
[3:10:58] your subconscious is thinking of that
[3:11:00] all the time
[3:11:02] and I said no psychiatrist could pull
[3:11:05] that out of you and I said you know that
[3:11:07] there's nobody in the world knows that
[3:11:08] but you and that man alone I said God's
[3:11:13] holy spirit has revealed to you and told
[3:11:16] you where your trouble now you go make
[3:11:19] that right with your husband and then
[3:11:22] you'll get well
[3:11:26] that's more noise than I expect
[3:11:29] she said I can't do it
[3:11:32] it would break up our home brother
[3:11:34] Branham she started crying
[3:11:38] said sister Branham don't you let him
[3:11:40] tell nobody that
[3:11:42] like that
[3:11:44] and I said now my wife said why he don't
[3:11:47] tell things like that sister said you
[3:11:50] know he wouldn't do that
[3:11:52] and she said and listen
[3:11:55] if if you should come
[3:11:59] supernaturally buy a piece of
[3:12:01] information or
[3:12:03] if someone who has come by something
[3:12:06] supernaturally
[3:12:08] should share that with you
[3:12:11] you shouldn't be a person to repeat that
[3:12:14] or or let that circulate among the
[3:12:17] people
[3:12:19] to do that would be so dangerous
[3:12:24] don't ever use something especially
[3:12:27] something you got Supernatural don't
[3:12:30] ever use that against somebody use it to
[3:12:33] try to help somebody tell the person
[3:12:36] guilty tell the person involved but be
[3:12:39] careful and don't don't don't feel your
[3:12:42] way into it
[3:12:43] if you don't know what to do with what
[3:12:46] you get pray about it
[3:12:49] he would leave me right now my husband
[3:12:51] and and said would break up my home what
[3:12:54] would happen to my little children and
[3:12:55] so forth This Woman's in a tether and I
[3:12:58] said look sister first clear yourself
[3:13:00] with God
[3:13:02] will take care of the rest of it
[3:13:06] so she said well I just can't do it
[3:13:08] brother Branham
[3:13:09] and I said of course now that's all I
[3:13:12] can do sister I've just done what God
[3:13:13] told me to do there's your trouble I
[3:13:16] said they can anoint you with oil every
[3:13:18] five minutes through the day for the
[3:13:20] rest of your life
[3:13:22] it'll never do you any good
[3:13:25] I said they might lay their hands on you
[3:13:27] and stomp and kick devils and say get
[3:13:29] out of here Satan but you don't you just
[3:13:30] don't have to holler at him
[3:13:33] he knows what faith is he knows what
[3:13:36] your life is so there's no need in you
[3:13:38] trying to bless him he will stay right
[3:13:40] there and got a right to stay there as
[3:13:43] he knows what his rights is what he can
[3:13:45] do and what he can't and she said well I
[3:13:48] just can't do it we're nearly done
[3:13:51] I started to walk away
[3:13:53] and she started crying I look back and
[3:13:56] standing by her side stood another man
[3:13:58] in a vision
[3:14:01] think about it
[3:14:03] God's about to come to This Woman's
[3:14:05] rescue
[3:14:06] I know you're tired
[3:14:11] I look back standing by her side of the
[3:14:13] other man in a vision I said isn't your
[3:14:14] husband kind of a tall man
[3:14:16] yes he has black hair yes Combs it over
[3:14:19] sideways kind of wavy yes and I said
[3:14:22] he's a deacon in your church that church
[3:14:24] yes
[3:14:25] and I said he's got the same rottenness
[3:14:30] to confess to you
[3:14:35] talk about freedom
[3:14:40] now that woman couldn't go home wild and
[3:14:42] mad
[3:14:45] this was the day that she had to tuck
[3:14:46] her own feelings and emotions down and
[3:14:49] she had to go take the Deliverance that
[3:14:51] God was about to give her and let it be
[3:14:54] this is good for the goose good for the
[3:14:56] gander kind of stuff isn't it
[3:14:59] he's got the same rottenness to confess
[3:15:01] to you I said when he landed in France
[3:15:04] told about a girl with him
[3:15:06] then said working doesn't he work for
[3:15:08] the Chevrolet company yes he does
[3:15:11] and I said there's a lady who works
[3:15:13] there that's a black-headed in the
[3:15:14] office I said he was in a Green
[3:15:16] Chevrolet car he was out in the lane at
[3:15:18] a certain place with that woman she was
[3:15:20] wearing a pink dress no more than the
[3:15:21] day before yesterday
[3:15:24] he's got the same thing to confess
[3:15:27] now brother Brandon would have never
[3:15:28] told that woman what that man did
[3:15:30] had God not brought it out in such a way
[3:15:33] that she was about to get the boldness
[3:15:36] she needed
[3:15:37] to confess her own why she said not my
[3:15:40] husband he's a deacon
[3:15:44] I said no wonder brother Johnson can't
[3:15:46] get nowhere down there
[3:15:48] I said such is that in your church
[3:15:50] that's right he said that's what's a
[3:15:52] whole lot of matter with a lot of
[3:15:53] churches too God will never bless
[3:15:57] God will never bless
[3:16:00] he'll never bless over sin
[3:16:04] and I said you go get your
[3:16:06] she said my husband wouldn't I said all
[3:16:08] right that's all I know you go get your
[3:16:11] husband make that thing right and you
[3:16:12] all get your life straightened up then
[3:16:14] God will be with you
[3:16:16] well I went on in to see another person
[3:16:19] and when I come back Mida she went in
[3:16:21] and called her husband on the phone the
[3:16:23] other ladies come and they went and met
[3:16:25] my wife said do you think they'll come
[3:16:28] back I said sure they'll be back
[3:16:30] so it hadn't been but a little while my
[3:16:32] wife said look coming up the steps here
[3:16:34] they come whoa
[3:16:37] here they come with their arms around
[3:16:39] one another
[3:16:43] seed Deliverance is possible and and
[3:16:46] help is possible you just got to get out
[3:16:50] from under the burden
[3:16:52] he said here they come with arms around
[3:16:54] one another just to cry and the tears
[3:16:55] running down their cheeks I open the
[3:16:58] door I said what about it
[3:17:00] he said brother Brandon my wife call me
[3:17:03] and I got in the car she come confessing
[3:17:05] to me that a wrong Shia did and said she
[3:17:07] come accuse me of the same thing and I
[3:17:10] said where have you been and she said
[3:17:12] it's a truth brother Branham
[3:17:15] I said I don't know you I've heard of
[3:17:17] You by Brother Johnson but said I never
[3:17:19] seen you but I want to shake your hand
[3:17:21] and say it's the absolutely truth and
[3:17:24] I'm guilty and no good to be called a
[3:17:26] father and my children are a deacon in
[3:17:28] the church and as soon as I can get to
[3:17:29] brother Johnson I'll resign from my job
[3:17:33] and I said don't do that
[3:17:40] see the difference between religion
[3:17:43] and relationship
[3:17:46] religion would have had that man
[3:17:48] standing down for 30 years
[3:17:52] but he was about to prove his
[3:17:54] relationship
[3:17:55] and God can work with that
[3:17:58] you see when a man is truly sorry when a
[3:18:01] woman's truly sorry their life changes
[3:18:03] their their demeanor changing their
[3:18:05] personality changes
[3:18:07] a man that's coming out of out from
[3:18:09] under a lie while he's the most humble
[3:18:11] person he's not bragging anymore
[3:18:15] he's humble
[3:18:17] he like my granny used to say he's as
[3:18:20] humble as an old dish rag
[3:18:22] he's not boasting on his family and
[3:18:24] boasting on his on his job and boasting
[3:18:27] on the things he's accomplishing no no
[3:18:28] no he's he gets way down low
[3:18:31] so that relationship with God can be re
[3:18:35] reformed and oh anyway it goes on I said
[3:18:38] don't do that just get right with God
[3:18:40] and continue with your job see I said no
[3:18:43] need to doing that he said oh if God
[3:18:45] would forgive me I said sure he'd
[3:18:47] forgive you now you confessed your wife
[3:18:49] ask her to forgive you you all forgive
[3:18:51] one another yes I said now sit down now
[3:18:54] is the time
[3:18:56] then I went down and said Heavenly
[3:18:58] Father this demon has tormented this
[3:19:01] girl for all these years has no legal
[3:19:03] right
[3:19:05] [Music]
[3:19:07] come on church I know you're tired
[3:19:12] well dismantling the accuser's case
[3:19:16] against you
[3:19:17] [Applause]
[3:19:20] musicians are slipping up
[3:19:24] he has no legal right to hold her now
[3:19:27] because it's done been found and made
[3:19:29] right now come out of her come out of
[3:19:31] her
[3:19:32] in the name of Jesus Christ and this is
[3:19:34] Brother Graham's report and she's
[3:19:36] perfectly normal and well
[3:19:38] from that time on c c what is it it goes
[3:19:43] slow but we get the costs
[3:19:45] see what I mean Visions that's the
[3:19:47] reason some of you send me letters and
[3:19:48] say brother Roberts will pray for 500
[3:19:50] while while brother branham's praying
[3:19:52] for two
[3:19:53] brother Roberts is praying for people
[3:19:55] the way God told him to do it it's
[3:19:56] brother Oral Roberts he's talking about
[3:19:58] I'm doing it the way God told me to do
[3:20:00] it see
[3:20:01] but I want to know what I'm doing and
[3:20:03] before I condemn a satanic spirit and so
[3:20:05] forth I want to know first
[3:20:07] whether that's in God's legal plan
[3:20:12] his brother Bosworth said Jesus died for
[3:20:14] everyone that's right then if you're
[3:20:16] living in above that reproach and doing
[3:20:18] right then Satan has to turn loose of
[3:20:20] you but if there's anything back behind
[3:20:22] there maybe something that you ought to
[3:20:24] have done maybe you're living clean and
[3:20:26] pure
[3:20:27] but God told you something to do and you
[3:20:29] neglected to do it and god holds that
[3:20:32] right on you until you go back and make
[3:20:34] that thing right again whether it's
[3:20:35] something you should have done or should
[3:20:37] not have done do you see what I mean now
[3:20:41] but friends with sincerity and working
[3:20:43] for the kingdom of God yet I labor under
[3:20:45] the name of a psychologist or a fortune
[3:20:47] teller or a devil that's the things they
[3:20:48] were saying about him
[3:20:50] but I'm only happy I'm only glad that I
[3:20:52] can represent Jesus Christ and he knows
[3:20:55] my heart and he knows I'm no
[3:20:57] psychologist or fortune teller I'm a
[3:20:59] Christian your brother trying my best
[3:21:00] for the kingdom of God by the power of
[3:21:02] God to help his poor six suffering
[3:21:04] children and I pray to God with all my
[3:21:06] heart soul and mind tonight that you'll
[3:21:08] be one that he will help can we bow our
[3:21:10] heads just a moment for prayer isn't
[3:21:13] that powerful
[3:21:14] heavenly father it's so sweet to come to
[3:21:16] you in the name of thy son I bless
[3:21:18] tonight as your servant these people
[3:21:19] whatever you're buying on Earth I'll
[3:21:21] bind it in heaven remit all of our sins
[3:21:24] tonight Lord I pray that you'll do it
[3:21:26] and Grant Lord that there not be one
[3:21:27] person who's present now that'll be lost
[3:21:30] in the great final day May every one of
[3:21:32] them be saved
[3:21:34] that was how he ended this
[3:21:37] long story
[3:21:44] three times
[3:21:47] prayed for
[3:21:49] the same man that cast out thousands of
[3:21:53] demons
[3:21:55] heal the sick and raise a dead
[3:21:58] but that Spirit had a legal right to
[3:22:02] torment that woman
[3:22:04] because she was carrying that burden
[3:22:06] around
[3:22:07] of not laying it all out before the Lord
[3:22:10] I want us to stand you that are able to
[3:22:13] stand
[3:22:15] and we're going to ask the Lord I want
[3:22:17] parents to ask the Lord
[3:22:21] search our hearts
[3:22:25] for things that we might speak over our
[3:22:28] children
[3:22:31] I don't even want you to if if Mama has
[3:22:35] a diagnosis or Daddy has a diagnosis I
[3:22:39] don't want you to accept that
[3:22:43] for your children
[3:22:47] a person that has a ADHD or some social
[3:22:52] disorder like that they can have
[3:22:55] children that don't have such a thing
[3:23:00] if you see little things that concern
[3:23:03] you run to God
[3:23:05] go to the Lord and ask him to help our
[3:23:08] children amen
[3:23:10] but let's be careful what we speak over
[3:23:13] them
[3:23:16] if there is something that is giving the
[3:23:19] enemy a legal right to hold on in your
[3:23:22] life
[3:23:24] I encourage you this is not about
[3:23:27] seeing you embarrassed it's about seeing
[3:23:30] you free
[3:23:32] otherwise that thing will just keep
[3:23:34] coming back and coming back and coming
[3:23:36] back
[3:23:37] only you know if there is something that
[3:23:39] needs to be laid out before the Lord
[3:23:43] if there's something that you need to
[3:23:45] make or right with him do it because I'm
[3:23:47] telling you there's no greater feeling
[3:23:49] in all the world and and Truth in all
[3:23:51] the world than to know that when that
[3:23:53] enemy stands there to try to accuse you
[3:23:55] the blood cries out if there's nothing
[3:23:58] if he has no why why the Bible tells us
[3:24:01] that that the enemy came to Jesus
[3:24:05] but there was nothing in him
[3:24:09] to agree
[3:24:12] with the accusation
[3:24:15] when the enemy comes to try to take you
[3:24:18] out let there be nothing found in you
[3:24:21] that agrees with any part of the enemy
[3:24:25] this is our prayer
[3:24:28] Lord search our hearts let's pray
[3:24:30] together as they play something getting
[3:24:33] ready for worship Lord search our hearts
[3:24:36] today
[3:24:38] I've taken way more than my allotted
[3:24:42] time
[3:24:45] but I pray that you will somehow let
[3:24:48] this be a a mark
[3:24:52] somehow today Lord let this be a a state
[3:24:55] driving moment
[3:24:57] for somebody
[3:25:02] let this be a an hour where a burden
[3:25:06] rolls off and
[3:25:08] not only what we carried in our
[3:25:11] conscience but but maybe carrying in our
[3:25:14] subconscious mind because we've never
[3:25:16] fully
[3:25:18] brought it out
[3:25:21] let today be a day that we get out from
[3:25:24] under the the edge of that burden
[3:25:28] We Stand free in your presence
[3:25:43] Maybe by default
[3:25:46] you've agreed with something spoken in
[3:25:49] your presence
[3:25:51] it was non-edifying
[3:25:54] you'd like to get out from under that
[3:25:56] burden denying you that that's one of
[3:25:58] those that you don't get out from under
[3:25:59] by going telling somebody what you said
[3:26:02] you get out from under by coming to the
[3:26:04] Lord and saying Lord help me forgive me
[3:26:06] and help me for for and forgive me for
[3:26:09] coming into agreement with that and may
[3:26:10] I never ever ever
[3:26:12] agree with the wrong again
[3:26:15] let me come out from under that
[3:26:18] Hallelujah I know you're weary I
[3:26:20] certainly sense and know you are
[3:26:23] Jesus come and help us
[3:26:27] help us right now
[3:26:29] if you'd like to talk to him a moment
[3:26:31] before we worship why don't you come
[3:26:33] everyone who will why don't we come and
[3:26:36] gather as close as we can and and again
[3:26:39] I'm not going to mention it again but
[3:26:40] it's it's late
[3:26:55] there must be some reason why the enemy
[3:27:01] is allowed to keep coming back and back
[3:27:04] and back
[3:27:06] in the same manner that he has come time
[3:27:09] and time again
[3:27:11] may God give us an answer
[3:27:14] may God give you an answer today
[3:27:17] to get out from under the burden
[3:27:22] let's come and pray right now you keep
[3:27:24] talking to the Lord Lord here we are

[3:27:44] enemy could use
[3:27:46] to hold on in our life
[3:27:48] may he be exposed today
[3:27:51] may we take the first step in getting
[3:27:54] him kicked out of his lodging place he's

[3:28:26] a a heavy moment it can be a it can be a
[3:28:30] liberating moment once we get the
[3:28:32] account settled
[3:28:38] [Music]
[3:28:42] I feel that enemy and I know how he
[3:28:44] likes to duck
[3:28:47] he locks this duck down he likes to
