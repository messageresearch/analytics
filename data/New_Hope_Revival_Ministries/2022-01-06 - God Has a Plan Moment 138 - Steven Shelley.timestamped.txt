[0:00] you are still
[0:02] a living
[0:04] attribute of god
[0:09] he cannot
[0:10] lose you
[0:19] how many of you are glad you're not
[0:21] living by chance
[0:23] you're not living by the draw the lucky
[0:25] draw you're living by a plan that god
[0:29] has laid out for our lives before we
[0:31] ever showed up here on this planet
[0:34] the good and the bad and the ugly
[0:37] now somebody said the whole world is
[0:39] churning trying to determine why bad
[0:42] things happen to good people i'm telling
[0:44] you this god is sovereign god has a plan
[0:48] if you'll just hold on to him you'll
[0:50] find out before it's over that he didn't
[0:53] forsake you he didn't forget you you
[0:55] didn't fall out of his love you didn't
[0:58] fall out of his care he allowed these
[1:00] things to come your way because he's
[1:02] bringing you to a higher glory he's
[1:05] bringing you to a place where you can
[1:07] meet him where he stands he stands today
[1:10] on the promised word for this year
[1:14] and god wants you to be able to meet him
[1:16] there
[1:17] you can't meet god in 2022 if you're
[1:20] still living in 2021
[1:24] you can't meet god for what he wants to
[1:26] do for us this year if you're still
[1:29] living in 1950
[1:32] you've got to catch up the reason why we
[1:35] get behind and we don't catch up is
[1:37] we're still trying to go and sort out
[1:40] all the things that happened to us
[1:42] why did that happen well why did that
[1:43] happen what if i'd done this but i want
[1:45] you to know your life your very
[1:48] existence your tomorrow your today is
[1:51] not in the hands of educated men it's
[1:54] not in the hands of a good hospital it's
[1:56] not in the hands of a good doctor your
[1:58] life is in the hands of a good god
[2:02] you say well i'm going through some
[2:03] stuff that's not good you may be 100
[2:07] telling it just like it is
[2:09] you may be going through something
[2:10] that's not good at all but i'll tell you
[2:11] what the bible said he works
[2:14] all things
[2:17] for the good
[2:19] when you're at your worst
[2:23] when you're so rotten you stink
[2:26] your attitude's foul
[2:30] you've grumbled more than you praised
[2:33] you are still a living
[2:37] attribute of god
[2:42] he cannot
[2:43] lose you
[2:46] he will not lose you
[2:50] he will chase you he will pursue you he
[2:54] will wrap his arms around you until you
[2:57] surrender again to the life that he has
[3:00] chosen for you one that is not by luck
[3:04] not by chance not by happenstance
[3:08] so you may think that this is a mistake
[3:10] and that's been a mistake and that's
[3:11] been a mistake i want you to know these
[3:14] things that have happened along the way
[3:16] could absolutely be god bringing us
[3:18] somewhere taking us somewhere we may not
[3:20] see the message until we're sitting down
[3:23] one day with our mind on him and it hits
[3:25] us like a thunderbolt
[3:27] oh now that makes sense
