and shout unto the lord with the voice of triumph hallelujah jesus is the victory he is the victor and he gives us the victory can you say amen we want to welcome you to our tuesday night stream only service and uh we are gathered here uh one two three four five and one outside with the window open helping us praising the lord with us and you are joining us across the world really i was looking at some of the of the comments and the amens and even prayer requests that are coming in and some of our own folk at home saying i'm singing you just can't hear me but i'm singing with you i appreciate that tonight you may not believe it but we feel you we feel you and we know your heart is here and we experience the presence of the lord he is with us and like i said if there's only five here that's just barely a handful but he said if two or three would be gathered in his name if we would have opened the doors well there would have been others who would have come but we are in a uh you know just a surge i guess you would say of the coronavirus and our church community and there is very few homes that haven't been touched in some way by it but i just want to give you good news jesus is still on the throne and he's still bringing his people through inch by inch we like leaps and bounds don't we but sometimes it's like millimeters and centimeters but i want you to know he's still bringing his people through we want to go to the lord in prayer we want to lift up your needs we are directing some of our thoughts tonight to our local congregation but we are delighted to have you join us we are streaming live on the new hope revival ministries app on facebook and on youtube and we appreciate your time the fact that you would join with us for a few moments or for the entire service is an encouragement and it's a blessing to us and i don't know about everybody else in this room but i want you to know that i am not discouraged i am encouraged but i am fervent and diligent in prayer and i'm taking it seriously because it's a serious hour that we're living in and there are some of our people who are fighting harder than others who are struggling a bit to keep their oxygen levels up and many are fighting the fever that comes and goes and comes and goes and you know that's our body it's our body responding to uh this viral um trespassing i would say and the body just starts working against that and i'm just so thankful for so many who are testifying that their symptoms are mild to moderate and god is helping them through my heart is burdened tonight for those that are having a harder struggle those who are dealing with a lot of weakness and uh you know the the fatigue the ache that comes with it and some having also some of the respiratory issue that comes with it but i want to report to you that our our first cases the first two cases that we had uh in this surge have gone back to work and so they have come through it they have finished their quarantine and they are back on their job and i want you to know that many are coming along and they're going to follow them i know some are going to be cleared to go back to work on monday and tuesday and wednesday of this coming week and so i want to give god all the glory and i want to tell you that things are well but i also want you to know as a body and we don't mind our friends and families knowing that we would appreciate their prayer we want you to know that there are some who are fighting a little harder than others particularly those who live alone sometime it's so important i'm not going to give you a medical advice or opinion tonight but it's so important to stay hydrated you've got to drink water water water water water it's so important that you do that and i know that a few people that have gone to the emergency clinics that they have they have been told that it's very very important that you stay hydrated that you get rest that you follow some of the protocols that have been shared with you uh taking your vitamins and so forth and if you're on medication you'll be faithful to take that if you're under the advice of a doctor you'll be faithful to do what you're told as long as you feel the witness in your spirit to follow those instructions because we believe that god is bringing his people through and we're claiming that everyone is going to have the victory and so we're not going to be meeting in person this coming sunday or or the following tuesday night one week from tonight but we're just believing that there's going to be so much of a breakthrough between now and the following sunday that we're going to be able to gather again god willing if we have to adjust that we will this is not a matter of pride this is a matter of wanting to be cautious and wanting to be careful and but yet we long to be together and that would put us back together in person on sunday august the 22nd if that's the will of the lord i'm ready for it if he wants us to be stream only for another week i'm ready for that i just want to be in the center of his plan we want to go to the lord in prayer i've already mentioned those who are really needing our prayers weakness i've heard from several today who just say they're just so weak they can hardly uh get up and get around like they need to get around and so we're believing that the strength of the lord is going to overtake them tonight and that a surge of god's healing power is going to move through their body pushing the weakness out and giving them revival strength renewed strength and it's a promise and we can certainly claim that promise we want to pray for uh a few in our church who work in different schools and even bus drivers we have quite a few bus drivers in our church we have some who work in in uh private school christian school public school and uh it's going back to school week and we want to pray for them one sister sent a prayer request just before the service who's starting back to school and she has a whole lot of five-year-olds in her class so we're praying that the lord will give her strength and give her a great school year and his presence be with her and go with her and strengthen her i've already heard today that some of the local kids started school i think in private school on thursday or friday of last week and i know of at least one class that's already turned out because of a coveted case they went two days and now they've been out two days so we just need the lord's perfect plan to unfold so that our kids can get the education that they need and we're a homeschooling church and so we realize that right now it's a little difficult for the mothers to rise up in in a lot of the homes and do the homeschooling that that we would normally be starting this time of year we encourage you not to fret we encourage you to trust the lord and there will be plenty of time and god will give you strength to make up and our kids are going to be fine because they are so blessed i want you to know they are so blessed to have that uh privilege of being trained and taught in their home by their mother by their parents and so we give god glory for making that possible in our nation we're a blessed people so i know that you have needs i saw where sister lasseter is mentioning a granddaughter uh she is from oklahoma sister lasseter is and her granddaughter is fighting covid and i see many others local friends and friends who are across the globe i'm sure you have needs i'm sure that you would like to be remembered to the lord in prayer and we will also lift you up we know that god has got an answer for your problem and he's got a supply for the need that you have so let's just go to him right now if we could just sing only believe just a chorus or two of only believe because i i know that's right the bible said all things are possible to him that believeth and we want to sing this and let our faith be fertilized and anointed by the holy spirit as we sing it only believe oh only believe [Music] all things are possible only believe [Music] believe lord we believe only believe all things are possible [Music] only believe now let's sing lord i believe lord i believe oh lord i believe that all things your word says are possible lord i believe oh lord i believe the lord i believe that all things are possible lord i believe heavenly father how we thank you tonight for the privilege that you have given us of serving a living god we are serving you because you came seeking for us you came seeking to save that which was lost and you found us we were the one lost you found us and you dealt with our hearts and you provided a way of escape and deliverance through your precious blood and by your amazing grace and we want to thank you for that tonight lord there are many not just in our community but there are many around the world battling this vicious virus it's affecting people differently but every bit of it lord we know it's the work of the enemy and even though you allowed it we know where the source is and we are coming to you for help for mercy lord we were not having this attitude that said well we're christians and we won't get sick because we see christian people getting sick all the time but we're so thankful that we have a great physician and that you bore stripes on your back to heal our sick and diseased bodies so we pray right now lord specifically we pray for this congregation this body of believers that you have placed us in we pray for those who are weakened in their system who need the strength of the lord we're calling on you my god to break through the weakness of their flesh and release to them your strength and virtue you carry it and you release it according to your will we're asking that they would be raised up tonight in the mighty name of yeshua our messiah in the mighty name of the lord jesus christ with an infusion of virtue with an infusion of your mighty strength oh god you're more than able those who need a stirring in their appetite and they need a reminder lord to drink i pray god you'll make it possible for those who live alone i pray you'll be a comfort to them lord and that you will help them get through this trial we know there are some who are elderly there are some who are a bit compromised and they need your help there are those who have symptoms but have not received a test but lord we're just believing that you're able to go to the root of the cause if it's a virus we need you lord if it's a summer cold or a sinus infection we need you lord and our bodies having all been exposed to it no doubt our bodies are fighting hard and those who have of us who have had it some months back we thank you for those antibodies trying to do their job that's how you built us but lord we need you to strengthen our system to fight off and to push back the onslaught and we ask for great deliverance in the name of jesus i want you to reach your faith toward the lord but reach out your hand as a point of contact i'm not ashamed i'm not embarrassed to tell you that when two or more come together touching any one thing he's promised so we're just releasing right now i'm stretching my hand toward the believer you're stretching your hand toward me we're looking to god for our help and we're coming into agreement right now that god will turn this thing we're not just praying against fever we're praying against the root of what's causing that fever and we command that virus to die in the name of jesus and pass from our bodies for the glory of god we pray for those starting to school and those among us who drive school buses who teach children they need the anointing of the lord because of the hour that we live in right now where things are so difficult i pray for sister lasseter's granddaughter and i pray for the needs of every person that are that is represented right now by those watching this program i pray for my precious precious mother in the faith sister green who's dealing with some issues in her body you are the healer i'm asking you to reach down in tucson arizona and heal her body tonight and strengthen her lord in the mighty name of the lord jesus we believe we pray for other needs represented right now in this time of corporate prayer oh god and we ask that testimonies be raised up and come out of these trials lord i can't help but feel like you're doing something even now for the glory of god and i want to thank you we as a body of believers and those joining with us tonight in this service we just want to say thank you lord thank you lord you're so good you're so faithful you're so wonderful we love you we ask for this help in the mighty name of the lord jesus christ and we know it's done amen and the saints of god said amen amen amen let's sing before we preach a little tonight let's sing just a verse or two and a course or two of victory in jesus unplanned unrehearsed but i think we know it good enough that we can sing just a little of it tonight [Music] heard an old old story how a savior came from glory how he gave his life on calvary to save a wretch like me oh i heard about his groanings of his precious blood's atoning then i repented of my sin and won the victory help me sing o victory in jesus my savior forever oh he sought me and he bought me with his redeeming blood oh he loved me air i knew him and all my love is to him he plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing blood oh i heard about his healing of his cleansing power revealing how he made the lane to walk again he caused the blind to see oh and then i cried dear jesus come and heal my broken spirit oh and somehow jesus came and brought to me the victory oh i've got victory in jesus my savior forever you know he sought me and he bought me with his redeeming blood oh he loved the air i knew him and all my love is to him he punched me into victory beneath the cleansing flood one more time sing o victory in jesus my savior forever he sought me and he bought me with his redeeming blood oh he loved the air i knew him and all my love is to him he plunged me into victory beneath the cleansing floods yes he did yes he did oh victory in jesus we have the victory tonight because we have the victor on board he lives in our hearts would you i know they can't hear you but would you just clap your hands for mary beth and benjamin tonight helping with the music god bless you both thank you mary beth leaving her children at home just here on the grounds to come and be with us and to help us and we're just giving god the praise and joshua here tonight to help us with the sound and the projector a bit and hawk i tell you brother hawk is one of the most dependable uh workers in the kingdom in in in this little ministry i i just couldn't thank him enough for just how faithful he is and uh i always want them to have the option but he's ready he's willing and i'm so thankful for him tonight all these moments so many of the things that you see on facebook and social media he puts those together the website and some of the other ministry outreach the app and all a lot of that's taken care of brother r.j and we appreciate him so much for the work that he does for us as well we're just grateful we're just blessed to be able to be a small church here in good old alabama with a big outreach and that is the goodness of the lord and we want to give him praise and to give him thanks for that and we want to just spend a small time we we're not going to take a lot of time tonight just to be honest with you i want you resting but i just want to take a few moments and i'm not going to say one thing that you don't already know i thought there for a while that we would just do part two of the spirit of holiness but i don't want to take that much of your time tonight so i want to go to psalm 91 you'll know right away where we're going and here's a brother just texting right now praise the lord i'm 100 today god bless god bless our brother i'm so thankful that he has come through it and is feeling 100 that is the goodness of the lord psalm 91 i want to share just a few little thoughts with you psalm 91 beginning in verse 1. so familiar so familiar but sometimes we have a tendency to forget and that reminds me a.w tozer said something well he said a lot of things i like but one of the things that a.w tozer said he said sometimes when we get overwhelmed we forget how big god is have you ever experienced that in your life when you're in the heat of the battle when you're having one of those bad days fighting off the virus you go for hours even a half a day without fever and the fever comes back and you you are just overwhelmed for a few moments the enemy tries to creep in with some thought and really wear you out i think a.w tozer had it right don't you when we get overwhelmed sometimes and that's the work of the enemy that anxiety that will come overwhelming us waiting us down and it's in that moment that we so often forget whose we are i saw recently where someone was posting and they were a little bit put off by something that really blesses me we have brother branham making a statement about the bride knowing who she is and how vital and how important that is but someone was making a statement and they were saying something like well i don't know about that i think it's more important to know who god is well i want you to know that's why god sent us a message of truth that's why we have the holy ghost to reveal to us who jesus is to show us what kind of god we really serve and when we get a revelation of who god is then we can get a revelation of who's we are we belong to that great mighty powerful god and then we begin to get a revelation of who we are because of him and who we are in him and that gives us so many times the ammunition and the weapons that we need to call the devil's bluff and to stand on the word when we are overwhelmed so i encourage you no matter what you're going through right now don't you let the circumstances of your sickness the circumstances of your family problem the the circumstances of the situation on your job so overwhelm you that you forget how big your god is yeah i've i've heard them say uh i don't remember if it was somebody famous who said it or not i've heard it through the years it might have been spurgeon i can't remember but one one person said when the enemy comes to remind you of how big your problem is you just tell the enemy how big your god is and i want you to know something else my god gets the last word his enemy doesn't get the last blow he doesn't get to strike the last punch my god has the last punch my god has the last word he strikes last and it doesn't matter how hopeless it looks you just let mighty god our god let him step in and i'm telling you what he knows how to drive the enemy out and he knows how to silence the enemy sometimes we have to come into a cooperation a cooperative spirit with god and we have to start turning off the voice of the enemy in our in our head we've got to win this greatest battle ever fought now in psalm 91 verse 1 it says he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty now i want to ask you a question this evening where is that secret place is it in quarantine somewhere is it in a storm shelter somewhere is it in a hazmat suit somewhere no that secret place is found in jesus christ when we are in him when we are branches abiding in the vine the lord jesus christ then we discover a secret place a place of refuge a place to hide when the storms of life are passing through we find a refuge in him we find a strong tower in the name of the lord and we as his righteous we run into that tower and we know that we are safe from alarm it doesn't mean that the enemy won't strike it doesn't mean that he will not try to overcome us we know this is part of our living is to is to grow up and learn how to be overcomers in all things i believe one of the most important things that we can yield ourselves to in this last hour is that anointing of the flying eagle that lifts us up above the circumstance the situation the doctor's report the lies of the of the devil the lies of the enemy he lifts us up above that that flying eagle anointing we get a different perspective when we get up above when we come up he's calling us like he called john in revelation chapter 4. there is a door that's open there is a voice that's calling to his bride come up here he wants to talk to us he wants to strengthen us he wants to heal our bodies he wants to give us the victory i believe that with everything that is within me we won't find the secret place in in what the world can provide you know the bad storms the tornadoes the hurricanes they they blow through here and there are storm shelters open and uh churches will open their gymnasiums schools will open their cafeterias and people will go there and take storm shelter and i want you to know that's a good idea for some people who live in a structure maybe that's not as secure as one of these commercial buildings but i want you to know nobody can tell where that storm is going to go nobody can predict in what direction it's going to blow we know that in this community because we lost many lives just a few years back with one that came right through beauregard alabama but i want you to know in the midst of all that there is a safety place there is a secret place that's found in christ i haven't mentioned this in a couple years now but there was a video of a of an elderly colored woman who lives over here in beauregard precious woman and her home was there with her family and i think there were members of the family in the community maybe some of them even lost that tornado come through and blew down her house there was one little closet standing everything else gone carport gone kitchen gone bedroom gone living room gone but one little closet was left standing and there she sits in a chair after everything is blown over right beside that little closet that was her prayer closet god allowed her to find a secret place in him and it was symbolized by that little closet where she had knelt many times to pray and she was a facetiming on the telephone a grandson that was somewhere else and she's telling him with everything that's within her you better praise god honey you better thank god honey you better give god praise honey he's the one that brought us through he's the one i want you to know that that home could not provide for her the safety that she needed but there was somebody who could there is somebody who can give you the secret place he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high and i don't believe that's a physical place i believe that's a spiritual place where we move into a place of trust a place of rest a place of knowing that nothing is going to happen to me that god is not able to see me through according to his will i need an amen i need an amen from somebody i tell you he's more than enough verse 2 psalm 91 i will say of the lord he is my refuge thank you i'm hearing them they're coming in on the text thank you for those amens i will say of the lord he is my refuge he is and my fortress he is my refuge and my fortress my god in him will i trust i want you to know brother sister the devil doesn't want you trusting god the devil wants you in a panic the devil wants you bowed down with anxiety and with attacks of panic the devil wants you worried he's not happy unless you're walking through your home ring in your hands i don't know what i'm going to do i don't know how i'm going to make it out i tell you what you need to make sure you make the devil good and mad by saying boldly declaring boldly when he comes with his lies i will say of the lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god and i will trust in him my trust is in the lord i thank god for doctors i thank god for law enforcement i thank god for those who serve us i thank god for soldiers for army men and navy men and air force men marines all over the world fighting standing at guard to protect us and to protect our freedoms i thank the lord for all of this but i want you to know that's not where my real safety comes from my real protection comes from a higher place if god is on your side if you're with him if your trust is in him he knows how to bring you through i need an amen he knows how to bring us through surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noisome noise some pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust hallelujah his truth shall be thy shield and buckler thou shall not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flyeth by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasted at noonday i want you to go down just a little bit verse verse 9 because thou has made the lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation will you make the lord your dwelling place will you make the lord your habitation will you hang out in him and with him not just when the storms of life are passing through but when things are going good when everything seems to be clicking along just fine will you hang out with the lord then will you be faithful to his house then will you be faithful to his word then this is a powerful verse he said to us clearly only because excuse me verse 9 because thou hast made the lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling you say wait a minute brother shelly wait a minute what about cancer what about coronavirus what about pneumonia what about all these other blood diseases and heart diseases aren't they plagues something's wrong here this says that there will be no plague come nigh my dwelling i want you to understand you can look at this i don't have time to do it with you tonight but i've done it multiple times i've looked at this in the original language and what the psalmist is saying is that nothing is going to touch you nothing is going to come into your home nothing is going to come your way that god is not fully completely totally aware of and not only is he aware of it he's already made a way of escape he's already made a way of deliverance he's already made a way of healing you say how is that because he took your your the chastisement of your peace the chastisement of my peace was upon him uh all my iniquity and all my sin he took and he took those stripes on his precious back hallelujah to cover my sin and to heal my body and to give me total deliverance of what the enemy would like to do to those who call on the name of the lord so there's going to be some sickness that will come our way there's going to be hardship there's going to be problems that rise there's going to be christian people that suffer with the same diseases that people who don't trust in the lord but here's one thing you can know if it touches you god has already known it he has already seen it he has even allowed it and if he has he has a plan he has a purpose he's going to work something glorious in your life he's going to speak to your loved ones he's going to speak to your neighbors he's already got a plan can you trust him can you make the lord your habitation can you make him your dwelling place i know you can i know you can and when you get weak and feel like you can't let the joy of the lord strengthen you let jesus rise up in you and do for you what you cannot do for yourself there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling and that means nothing will escape his eye nothing will escape his hand for he shall give hear hear this for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways thank you for the promise lord they shall bear thee up with their hands lest thou dash thy foot against a stone this is the grace of god this is the keeping power of the lord he is faithful in all of his ways if we'll dwell verse 1 said he that dwelleth in the secret place i looked up that word dwelleth in the in the lexicon in the hebrew lexicon and it says to remain to sit to abide to have one's abode it means to marry to marry he that will marry himself to the most high he that will come into the most high and make him our habitation our place of dwelling if we will make him the lord of our life he's going to take care of us no matter what the enemy would rage and threaten against us the secret place is not a location it's not a geographical spot on a map the secret place is a person and his name is lord jesus christ i don't have any means to show you this like we normally do when we make a quote from the message of brother branham but i want to read it to you anyway tonight before we before we close in a message called spiritual food in due season 1965 paragraph 37 we hear brother branham saying now but elijah during this time had a secret place that god had ordained for him to go to that's the thing we want to see now just before we have the prayer line elijah had a secret place provided by god himself can i just pause a moment and tell you my brother sister so to you so do i elijah's not the only one that god has provided a safe place for now he goes on to say the church never provided it for him the king never provided it for him he didn't provide it himself but god provided a secret place for elijah to be fed all the time during the drought where his food was provided day by day can you thank god for his provision can you thank god for making a way for you to have what you need he's so faithful he didn't need to wonder what's going to happen tomorrow or wonder if the supply would run out no sir god said i have commanded the ravens they they'll feed you what a wonderful thing a type of our secret place in christ i want you to know if god commanded the ravens to come and provide for his prophet he has a secret place and a plan for your provision for my provision for our healing for our help if we'll put our trust in him in the same message he goes on to say in paragraph 126 and that is christ that is christ he's the secret place he said if you can hide away in that now in that secret place you can eat and see the goodness and mercy of god if you're sick there is healing there we we when we look around and see so many of our brothers and sisters so many of our friends fighting with a positive test on this virus and yet we can be so thankful tonight that as of this moment they're not in the hospital as of this moment they're not on a ventilator as of this moment they're fighting daily by the grace of god coming through it little by little knowing that jesus is the way out he's the way out of it he's the way to get them through now i believe that the bible is clear that there is an appointed time man has an appointed day on this earth it's almost as though we have an expiration date there is a day in the mind of god when you and i are going to leave this place and and we are we're going it's appointed unto man wants to die and after death there is a judgment for those who do not serve the lord but i don't believe the enemy can steal your life i don't believe he can take your life i've heard people say why the devil just murdered that man i want you to know if that is your theology you are putting more power and authority in the enemy of god than you are in god god is the one who created that lucifer he created that one that has become our arch enemy you could say he was created and for a purpose we need not think that god didn't know what was going to go on in the enemy's life he knew exactly how he was going to fail he knew exactly what was going to enter his heart and cause the rebellion and yet the prophet of god tells us that he is no more than a tool in the hand of god to perfect the saints of god and i believe that with all my heart he's going to make a way god is going to make a way and he's going to bring us through if we put our trust in him so we can stand on this word we can stand on this promise and you can eat he said you can eat and see the goodness and mercy of god i'm seeing the mercy of god when i get a text from someone who said i believe my bad days are over or i get i'm 100 or i'm going back to work i tell you i just stop right there and raise my hands and say lord that's your mercy that's your goodness that's your grace we're going to keep on believing keep on pressing in i have shared this many times through the years but here is a little story that i like very much that brother branham told i hope it'll be an encouragement to some of you maybe there may be somebody watching this on social media who's never heard this story before brother branham tells it multiple times this is uh one sermon in 1964 turn on the light that'll give you a little hint what it's about i've read it here i think i read it last year when some of this stuff was just beginning to uh to touch our community in paragraph 165 he said now it reminds me of another little story not going back to stories but a friend of mine was standing in carlsbad new mexico when he was there holding a meeting up at carlsbad and there was a bunch of people went down into that cave that famous cave there in carlsbad the caverns in carlsbad he said i never did like that stuff down there where it's deep and about a mile in the ground he said i'm satisfied up here but so they went down through i want to go higher not lower he said they took this fella and went down in there he was a a man a friend and his little girl and a little boy went down with them and they went way down into a big basement oh i guess hundreds of feet hundreds and hundreds of feet below the surface of the earth went down there and the man there by the switch all at once brother branham was just kind of symbolizing that with a sound of snapping his finger he'd get them all down there and all of a sudden the man would flip the switch turn off the switch and it was so black and so dark until you couldn't even see your hand moving in front of your face that's dark and little girl a little thing was real scared and she began to scream out in that dark i guess she did to the top of her voice oh it's dark it's dark it's dark she was screaming hysterically her little brother happened to be standing nearer and he screamed out into the darkness and he said fear not little sister there is a man here who can turn on the light my i like that i want to say that to you right now fighting the virus fighting the oppression of the enemy in your mind fighting whatever symptom the enemy has tried to uh really tie you down with there's a man who can turn on the light it may be so dark it may feel so overwhelming that you couldn't see your hand in front of your face but i want you to know there's a man that has a switch and he has power to turn on the light that moment of darkness and hopelessness and hysterical fear can leave you in an instant when the man is there to turn on the light he said hallelujah what's this little church going to do don't worry there is a man here today that can turn on the light he said that's the lord jesus christ oh yeah the lord jesus christ he goes on to say remember the blind the rich man in the days of jesus it was wasn't put out and blinded from the glare of jerusalem when they got there asking about him their theology couldn't explain it but when they turned aside they followed it to the eternal life light he's speaking to businessmen he said you businessmen today don't watch the glares of these organizations but hold on to the word it leads you to the light fear not little sister there is a man here who can turn on the lights there is a christ here who can make his word live just the same as he was then vindicate himself that he's the same yesterday today and forever and brother branham ask the congregation do you believe it i want to ask you tonight as we prepare to bid you a good night allow you to get some rest i want to ask you do you believe it do you believe that you that one moment can look so hopeless so dark so much fear trying to creep in and in one moment once suddenly the man who has power over the switch can flip that switch flood the darkness of your situation flood the darkness of your sickness the pain that is wracking your body when that man i feel the presence of the lord now i feel like god wants to do it for somebody will it be you brother will it be you will it be you sister will you take god at his word will you tell the lord right now i'm going to make god my habitation no matter what the enemy tries to do some of you are so worried so fretting over loved ones some of you are so troubled and so disturbed by what's going on in your family it's really wearing you out i want to tell you in the name of the lord there's a man in here who can turn on the lights there's somebody who has power over those circumstances i want to just read another paragraph here this is from uh brother branham telling the same story in another message this one was called there's a man here that can turn on on the light jeffersonville uh december of 63 12 29 just uh two little paragraphs i think it is he said and this little girl standing there she was screaming to the top of her voice about to go into hysterics about like the little bride is oh he was seeing that the pressure of that hour was nearly to drive the bride into hysterics i want you to know there are so many things that are volatile around us right now and ever changing right now that that any moment it seems like the enemy would like to drive you into hysterics into a fit where you would not even be able to control your emotion he said this little girl was about to go into hysterics about like the little bride is but you know what her little brother cried out little sister don't fear cause he was standing right by the engineer hallelujah the little boy didn't have to be afraid he saw the man turn the switch off he was standing right by the engineer the one who was running that elevator the one who was lifting up and raising up that lift and bringing him down into that big cavern in carlsbad he was standing next to him hallelujah you get close to him you get close to the engineer you get close to the lord jesus christ the closer you get to him the more you'll remember he's the one who is able to flood the darkness of your life with his light he is light he said uh he was standing right by the engineer said there's a man here who can turn on the light don't get scared he said don't pay any attention to what they're doing you do you walk in darkness you'll walk in darkness he said be wise they that do wise in these last days we'll do exploits for god he's talking about daniel those who know their god they'll walk in the light he said don't worry it may be dark may look like they're going to force us everyone all these you see their proclamation going out all these little churches and things have got to come in now you've got to come in or they're going to close you up they're going to make you do this they're going to make you do that listen brother branham was picking up on what the spirit of that age was trying to do the same spirit multiplied i don't know how many times is after the true church of jesus christ in this hour but you do not have to be afraid he says in the same message another paragraph this is i think like the second half of paragraph 279 he said when the persecution comes don't get scared there is a light said he would catch his people away she'll not go through that tribulation she'll never do it he said she wouldn't do it she'll be caught away no matter how dark it gets you can't see your hand before you you remember there's a man in here who can turn on the light he'll rapture that bride he'll carry that church out of here i believe that i want you to know tonight i'm standing on that and i am trusting the lord i am trusting the lord that god is going to touch us i don't know why i'm doing it but i'm going to read one more it's just one little paragraph in paragraph 54 of it is the rising of the sun i want to share this with you he said now and then not only that he sent word to his disciples his believing he said fear not for i am he that was dead and is alive again forevermore and i have the keys of death and hell and i've already conquered it listen at what your savior said i've already conquered it he said don't fear anymore for every foreordained predestinated seed of god shall come to life when that life when that light spreads across the earth of the glorious gospel in every age it'll bring forth a crop that god ordained it to do he has raised from the dead i want you to know we have so much hope we have so much hope in christ and uh i want you to know that fear is of the devil and fear brings torment and perfect love casteth out fear and you'd say well i'm a child of god i don't have to deal with fear i i i just wonder brother sister maybe you're living a higher place than i am maybe you live in a higher place than most people i know but i what i find out is that most every one of god's children has that moment that certain situation in their life where the enemy tries to bring fear and sometimes it's inbred in us sometimes it's instilled in us even in our childhood we're taught to be fearful of things and the enemy oh how he likes to anoint that how he likes to exploit that in our life but we know that there is a remedy i'll tell you the fear of the lord is the remedy of fear to fear the lord to understand the awe and the reverence of god is to give you the strength that you need to put away all the rest of the fear that the enemy will try to use to destroy you another thing a.w toaster said in closing he said fear is of the flesh and panic is of the devil i want to say it again fear is of the flesh and panic is of the devil brother shelly are you trying to whip us to oh no sir you've misunderstood me if that's your takeaway that is not at all what i came over here to do i came here to let you know that everything you need is found tonight in the lord jesus christ he knows exactly what you're going through right now he sees the fever he sees the congestion he sees the panic that tries to get a hold of your life he knows every bit of it and he is standing right there and i know like like tozer said when we get overwhelmed we sometimes forget how big our god is i'm going to leave you with this before we pray another quote that i really like from oswald chambers and maybe you've read his devotional or read some of the things that he wrote so many years ago he said the remarkable thing about god is that when you fear god that's holy fear reverential fear reverential fear he said when you fear god you fear nothing else whereas if you do not fear god you fear everything else and i have found that to be the truth if you are not walking in the fear of the lord if you're not walking in aw i tell you what we begin to sing in here tonight all five of us benjamin's singing and playing the drums and the presence of the lord just come sweet i don't have to put on a praise i think sometime brother shelley you're just pushing you just carry on because you're trying to get somebody else whooped up i want you to know that is incorrect i don't have to be whooped up i don't have to be told to praise the lord nobody has to tell me to raise my hands and be loud the bible said praise him in a loud aloud with loud sounding symbol lift up your voice and cry loud to the lord nobody has to tell me that i tell you when i begin to think of the goodness of the lord we began to sing those beautiful songs tonight and it gives me so much peace i pray that it brought peace to your home i pray that it'll bring peace to your situation right now i want you to know that god is aware he is aware i'm seeing so many uh who are reaching out right now to encour to be encouraging and to ask for prayer may god bless every one of you i can't it won't hardly let me to go through and see everyone and call your name out but i will say this right now when we pray we're praying for you when we lift up the name the names of this congregation we're going to pray over your over you and your need in your life and we're going to say lord everyone who is streaming that service you see their need this is a battle we need each other we need each other if darkness should try to overwhelm you tonight you wake up in the night with a little fear creeping in it came to me once when i was fighting the virus in october we didn't do like some people do there they were on social media and they were giving reports about how they felt and i didn't do do that no we just tried to keep it among the saints here and we knew people were praying and there were some others who were suffering and we just tried to take it to the lord and i felt good for several days and then that one day that pressure began to come across my chest and i began to feel like something was sitting on top of my chest and for just a moment i'm just a human like you for just a moment of fear came over me and that i was going to smother i hate to say it like that but that's how it came and i want you to know i had i had to in fact friends pastor friends said to me if that little thing that you're feeling in your lungs if it's not better in the morning you promise me in fact one said you tell me right now you're going straight now to have an x-ray you should go right now you should go right now and i think maybe i might have already done such a thing as that but before i could that fear that tried to grip me i began to call on the lord i began to sing praises to god i began to think of the goodness of jesus and all that he has done in my life i want you to know he's been so good to me he has been so good to me and he began to lift that fear he began to push that fear away and i began to do every remedy and and the fried onions on my chest and everything else i don't want to say these things really out i don't want to give medical advice on here but oh how he delivered me and so i understand that some of you are suffering worse than i was some of you are dealing with it and and it's really really taking a toll i understand that i know that across the nation men and women are still losing their life but i want you to know that when that darkness tries to creep in if it should and totally black out any hope that you have had of getting through this i want to tell you little brother i want to tell you and i can say that because i'm older than some of you and i'm bigger than a lot of you so i can say little brother little sister i can say it with all respect little brother there's a man in your life there's a man there with you who can turn on the light he can shatter the darkness little sister there's a god who lives inside of you hallelujah his name is jesus and he knows how he's got his hand on the switch and he can turn on the light and scatter every bit of that darkness every bit of that hopelessness out of your life father i come to you right

the virus deliver us from the oppression of the enemy oh god you see how the enemy has taken a hold of many of our loved ones and just blinded them in this hour and overwhelmed them some have run from the faith instead of running towards you but i ask you lord tonight that you would send the holy ghost to get a hold of the backslider lord send the spirit of god in the spirit of conviction and the
