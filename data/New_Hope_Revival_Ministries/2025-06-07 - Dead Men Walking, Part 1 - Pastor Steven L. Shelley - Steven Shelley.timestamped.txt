[38:17] handle any problem that you
[38:19] have. Any need that's in your
[38:23] life. He is big
[38:26] enough. He's done it before. He'll do it
[38:29] again.
[38:32] He's never failed. He has a track record
[38:35] of getting things done.
[38:37] He knows how to do them best.
[38:40] We think we've got it all figured out
[38:43] and he comes along and just does it
[38:45] completely contrary to our thinking. And
[38:48] as we look back, we know that God had
[38:50] our best interest in mind. And he took
[38:53] care of the situation. He took care of
[38:55] the problem. He took care of the
[38:57] heartache. He took care of the grief. He
[38:59] took care of the pain because that's who
[39:01] he is. He is God who is big enough. He's
[39:06] bigger than all of my mountains. He's
[39:09] bigger than all of my valleys. And he's
[39:11] still he's still saving souls and
[39:14] delivering, setting free and giving us
[39:18] what we need to make it through Satan's
[39:20] Eden this last hour.
[39:23] Do you have a need on your heart
[39:25] tonight? We'll go to prayer and take our
[39:27] needs. Hands all over the building, out
[39:30] across the stream. The Lord sees the
[39:32] needs that you have. He knows best how
[39:35] to meet them. And we're asking him to
[39:38] meet the needs that you have. We know
[39:41] that God is more than able to do it.
[39:47] He is able to do the exceeding abundant
[39:50] above all that we could ask or think.
[39:54] Let's go to prayer today and take our
[39:56] needs. Father, we just want to thank you
[39:59] that you are God supreme.
[40:02] We thank you that we can have an
[40:06] assurance tonight that you are on the
[40:10] throne and that you will not leave us
[40:12] high and dry, but that you will handle
[40:15] the situation for us. Out across this
[40:18] congregation, there were hands that were
[40:20] lifted. Out over the stream, there were
[40:23] hearts that cried out for help from the
[40:27] God who is above it all. and we are
[40:29] bringing those needs to you tonight once
[40:32] again knowing that you are well able to
[40:36] meet those needs. Would you minister to
[40:39] hearts that are grieving tonight? Would
[40:41] you bring comfort as only you can? I'm
[40:45] asking you, Lord, for deliverance the
[40:48] for those that need deliverance tonight.
[40:51] I pray that you will bring restitution
[40:54] and reconciliation and healing as only
[40:58] you can. Father, there are those who are
[41:01] in need of physical healing. I'm asking
[41:04] you to do that right here tonight. Bring
[41:07] the manifestation of the healing that
[41:10] you have already paid for at Calvary.
[41:14] You did it at Calvary. You paid it all.
[41:16] You did it once and for all and you
[41:19] don't have to do it again. And I thank
[41:22] you that we can have an assurance of
[41:25] that tonight. Lord, I thank you for this
[41:28] service. I thank you for every person
[41:30] that you have brought here in the house
[41:32] tonight. I pray that you would let your
[41:35] sweet blessings fall on each one. The
[41:38] needs that they have that they brought
[41:40] with them. I pray that they'll press
[41:43] through and and worship and praise you
[41:46] and pull on the gift as the ministry of
[41:49] the word is going forth that our needs
[41:52] can be met in the house tonight. Would
[41:55] you minister through our pastor
[41:57] strengthen him in his physical body and
[41:59] I pray that he would be able to deliver
[42:01] the word that you have given to him for
[42:04] us tonight. May we Lord pull on the gift
[42:08] in him. May May we know that you are
[42:12] speaking to us
[42:15] get glory and honor for it is in the
[42:17] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The name
[42:19] above every name that we pray. Amen.
[42:24] We give you praise Lord. Can you give
[42:27] the Lord one more shout of praise
[42:32] tonight?
[42:34] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[42:41] You may have your seats tonight.
[42:47] What a blessing, what an honor it is to
[42:50] be gathered in the house of the Lord.
[42:52] We're happy to see you here with us.

[43:33] and Naomi
[43:35] and
[43:37] Daniel. Who am I

[44:02] brother. Your mom. All right, Kim. We're
[44:06] glad that you're with him.
[44:08] [Music]
[44:11] We're glad that you came to visit us
[44:14] tonight.
[44:19] Brother Dylan and Sister Rachel and the
[44:22] baby. We're glad that they're here this
[44:24] weekend. May the Lord bless you from
[44:25] North
[44:29] Carolina. Brother Austin and Sister
[44:31] Hannah Hollowell and Eli Natalie's over
[44:34] here. And then Lily, she's come with
[44:37] them. We're glad that they're here this

[44:45] Lillian. It's nice to see you. God bless
[44:47] you. We're glad that you're

[44:51] here. Liam, it's nice to see you. God
[44:54] bless you. We're glad that you made your
[44:55] way this way
[45:00] again. You're already seeing if I
[45:02] remember everybody right. Where did
[45:04] Hannah go? She's in the nursery. Well, I
[45:07] have a niece here with with her babies.
[45:10] Uh yeah. Is that Haven you're holding?
[45:13] All right. She's got a new one since she
[45:15] was here the last time. We're glad that
[45:17] she's here from Kentucky. May the Lord
[45:19] bless her while she's
[45:25] here. Did I get everybody? We're glad
[45:28] that all the home folks are here. We are
[45:30] glad that you want to come to the house
[45:32] of the Lord and and see what the Lord
[45:35] does among us. He, you know, he's made
[45:38] us promises and we're pressing into
[45:40] those promises.
[45:43] There are a lot of things that he has
[45:45] promised to us that our eyes have not
[45:47] yet beheld. But we don't give up
[45:50] pressing into them. We continue to press
[45:53] into the promises of God. Uh we find out
[45:56] in our Christian walk that there are a
[45:58] lot of things that are not just laid in
[46:00] our hands. We've got to fight tooth and
[46:03] nail for every inch of ground that we
[46:06] get because the devil doesn't want us to
[46:09] have what the Lord promised us. But he
[46:12] can't stop what God said is mine. He
[46:15] can't stop it. And I'm glad to know that
[46:18] I'm on the winning side. And I know that
[46:21] if I don't get to see it with my eyes,
[46:23] I'm going to pass it on to the next
[46:25] generation. And there's going to be
[46:27] somebody that's going to press into the
[46:30] goodness of God and see all of the
[46:33] promises of God fulfilled in the end
[46:36] time. Amen. We're here to worship the
[46:40] Lord. We're here to give him the praise
[46:42] that is due to his name. Brother Kate is
[46:45] going to sing for us tonight. And we're
[46:47] going to call on Brother Elas. And let's
[46:49] see. Brother Ian, let's call on you
[46:51] again. We're going to let these brothers
[46:53] come to you for the tithe and offering.
[46:55] And you give as giving unto the Lord. We
[46:58] do a lot of uh we do we're doing a lot
[47:01] for the kingdom and and we thank you for
[47:04] your giving and we're just a part of
[47:06] what God is doing all around the world.
[47:09] We're one small part, but we want to do
[47:12] what he's called us to do and not leave
[47:14] one thing unfinished. May the Lord bless
[47:17] you as you give tonight and let it be a
[47:19] part of your worship as brother Kate is
[47:21] worshiping together with us.
[47:25] Blessed be the
[47:30] [Music]
[47:36] [Music]
[47:49] I have dreamed
[47:51] of
[47:53] [Music]
[47:56] something. There's a place waiting for
[48:01] me.
[48:03] All my tears wiped
[48:06] away me and God face to
[48:10] [Music]
[48:12] face. And I know that I am going to make
[48:17] it home. When the road gets rough,
[48:27] you are more than
[48:33] enough. And you are the rock, the corner
[48:37] that I run to. Everything is gone. Still
[48:40] this I can hear you say I'm on your
[48:46] side.
[48:48] [Music]
[48:50] When I'm all alone and everything's
[48:53] against me, still I have a promise that
[48:56] will never depart from me. As long as
[49:01] I'm alive, you are on my side.
[49:10] That's true. Well, I've been blessed
[49:13] more than anyone can know, but still I
[49:16] won. Why did you still
[49:21] go on a hill to take my place and die
[49:25] for me? Oh, but I don't have to cry
[49:29] every time. There's a time that I feel
[49:32] that you're miles
[49:35] away.
[49:36] No, cuz you're standing in the fire with
[49:42] me when the road gets up.
[49:48] Thank you, Jesus. Oh, and you are more
[49:54] than
[49:56] enough. And you are the rock, the corner
[50:00] that I run to. And everything is gone.
[50:03] And the stillness I can hear you say,
[50:06] I'm all on your side.
[50:12] And when I'm all alone and everything's
[50:16] against me, still I have a promise that
[50:18] will never depart from me. As long as
[50:23] I'm alive, you are on my side. In the
[50:30] desert, in the valley, you are with me.
[50:34] Even on the mountain high, I've already
[50:38] won every battle. For you are on my
[50:45] side. You are the rock, the corner that
[50:48] I run to when everything is gone. And
[50:51] the stillness I can hear you say I'm on
[50:57] your
[51:00] side. And when I'm all alone and
[51:03] everything's against me, said I have a
[51:06] promise. ever depart from me as long as
[51:11] I'm alive. You are on my side. In the
[51:18] desert, in the valley, you are with me.
[51:22] Even on the mountain high, I've already
[51:26] won every battle. For you are on my
[51:31] side.
[51:34] You are the rock, the corner that I run
[51:37] to when everything is gone. In the
[51:40] stillness, I can hear you say I'm on
[51:45] your
[51:47] side. Oh, and when I'm all alone and
[51:51] everything's against me, still I have a
[51:54] promise. Never depart from me as long as
[51:59] I'm alive. You are on my side. As long
[52:05] as I'm alive. You are on my side.
[52:13] [Music]
[52:21] [Music]
[52:25] Oh
[52:27] yes. Hallelujah.
[52:32] You're on my side, Lord.
[52:37] And I'm
[52:39] learning to
[52:42] lean. I'm still
[52:45] learning to
[52:48] lean. I'm
[52:50] learning to
[52:53] lean on Jesus.
[52:56] [Music]
[53:00] I need more
[53:04] power than I
[53:07] ever
[53:10] dream. I'm
[53:12] learning to
[53:15] lean on
[53:20] Jesus. Yes, I'm
[53:23] learning to lean.
[53:27] I'm still
[53:29] learning to
[53:31] lean. I'm still
[53:35] learning
[53:36] lean on
[53:39] [Music]
[53:42] Jes. I'm still
[53:45] finding more
[53:48] power than I
[53:51] ever dream.
[53:54] I am
[53:56] learning to lead.
[53:59] [Music]
[54:00] Will you stand with us as our pastor's
[54:02] getting ready to come and minister? I'm
[54:06] learning to
[54:09] leave. I am
[54:12] learning to lead.
[54:15] I'm
[54:17] ready to
[54:19] lean on
[54:22] [Music]
[54:25] Jesus. I'm
[54:28] finding more
[54:30] power than I
[54:33] ever
[54:35] dreamed. I am
[54:38] learning to
[54:41] lean on you. Sing
[54:45] again. Oh, I am learning.
[54:50] [Music]
[54:52] I am
[54:54] learning to
[54:57] lean. Yes, I'm
[55:00] learning to
[55:02] lead on Jes.
[55:07] Well, I'm
[55:10] finding finding more
[55:13] power than I
[55:16] ever
[55:18] dream. I'm
[55:21] learning to
[55:23] lean on Jesus.
[55:31] Sad and
[55:34] brokenhearted at an
[55:37] altar. I
[55:39] knelt and I
[55:41] found God's peace is
[55:45] so
[55:47] serene, isn't
[55:49] it? Oh, and
[55:52] all that he
[55:55] has is a child.
[55:59] childlike heart and a heart that is
[56:06] learning to lean. Doesn't matter how
[56:09] long you've served him, we're still
[56:14] learning to
[56:15] lean. Oh,
[56:19] learning to lean.
[56:22] Yes, I'm
[56:24] learning to
[56:27] lean on
[56:31] Jesus. Oh, I'm
[56:34] finding finding more
[56:37] power than
[56:40] I I'd ever dreamed. Oh, I'm learning
[56:45] learning to
[56:47] lean on
[56:52] Let's go soft on the music and let's
[56:54] hear the saints sing tonight. I am
[56:58] learning.
[57:02] Oh, I'm learning.
[57:08] Yes, I'm
[57:11] learning to lean
[57:15] on Jesus.
[57:17] [Music]
[57:20] Oh, I'm
[57:22] finding more
[57:25] power than I
[57:29] [Music]
[57:32] ever learn.
[57:36] Praise the Lord.
[57:39] [Music]
[57:45] Sometimes we can
[57:49] be like the
[57:52] man who
[57:54] said, "My life is full now.
[57:59] I have
[58:02] [Music]
[58:05] everything. Oh, but there is a mighty
[58:10] strong rock in
[58:15] Jesus my
[58:17] Lord. Though my trial, through them all
[58:21] I've been
[58:23] learning to lean. Praise God. Let me
[58:26] hear you say that I Well, I'm
[58:31] learning learning to lean.
[58:34] Oh, I'm
[58:37] learning learning to leave.
[58:44] [Music]
[58:47] Oh, Jesus.
[58:50] [Music]
[58:52] Well, I'm finding
[58:55] finding more
[58:57] power than I
[59:01] ever
[59:02] dreamed. Oh, I'm
[59:06] learning learning to
[59:09] lean on Jesus.
[59:14] If you found him to be dependable, to
[59:17] lean on, I want you to clap your hands
[59:19] for the Lord. The Bible tells us to do
[59:22] it. The Bible said, "Plap your
[59:25] hands, all you people, and shout unto
[59:29] God with a voice of
[59:32] triumph." I'm thankful tonight that the
[59:35] shout of the King is still in the camp.
[59:39] Praise
[59:42] God. Oh, hallelujah.
[59:46] The shout of the Lord is still in the
[59:49] mouths of his saints. Bless him.
[59:55] [Music]
[59:56] [Applause]
[1:00:00] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:00:04] He's worthy.
[1:00:06] You may be seated this evening. There's
[1:00:09] something swelling in the house and you
[1:00:12] want it to swell. You see, the clouds
[1:00:16] have to swell up with moisture before
[1:00:18] they can empty out. I never know. You
[1:00:21] never know what the tipping point is.
[1:00:23] But God knows. And so it just keeps
[1:00:26] gathering moisture and gathering
[1:00:28] moisture until it can't hold anymore.
[1:00:30] And then it dumps right down on our
[1:00:32] heads. How many of you'd like to get
[1:00:34] under a shower tonight? The presence of
[1:00:38] the Holy Spirit just pouring out on you.
[1:00:41] Amen. I like to stay under the spout
[1:00:44] where the glory of God runs out. I like
[1:00:47] it when heaven comes down and kisses the
[1:00:49] earth and I'm right in the middle of the
[1:00:51] smack.
[1:00:53] I like that. I've been chasing that for
[1:00:56] a long time because I realize that it's
[1:00:59] him. That's right. He can't be anywhere
[1:01:02] that his presence is not. You You do
[1:01:04] understand that his presence is is him.
[1:01:06] It's it's a part of him. It's who he is.
[1:01:10] And so you're not chasing a feeling.
[1:01:13] Lord have mercy. No, feelings come and
[1:01:16] go. You can be mad one minute and glad
[1:01:19] the next. We're not chasing feelings,
[1:01:23] but per a person. Remember, we just
[1:01:26] recently talked about uh the distraught
[1:01:29] sisters of Lazarus. And uh they said,
[1:01:33] you know, if you'd have just been here,
[1:01:34] one of them, if you'd have been here,
[1:01:35] our brother Lazarus would not have died.
[1:01:38] And uh Jesus let her know that he will
[1:01:41] live again in the resurrection. I mean
[1:01:43] he'll live again. He will live again. Oh
[1:01:45] yes, I know he will live in the
[1:01:47] resurrection. These are powerful words.
[1:01:50] Jesus said you you may be looking you
[1:01:52] must be looking toward a day or an event
[1:01:55] or something. You see that's always in
[1:01:57] our mind. But he said I am.
[1:02:01] You don't have to wait for an event. I
[1:02:03] am the resurrection and the life.
[1:02:07] Aren't you glad he is?
[1:02:11] I'm so glad to see all of you in the
[1:02:13] house of the Lord this evening and his
[1:02:15] goodness is running over and we're
[1:02:17] thankful for for it. Uh we don't again,
[1:02:20] we don't live by feeling. We live by
[1:02:22] faith. But oh, it's good to feel him.
[1:02:25] Nothing wrong with feeling him. Amen. We
[1:02:29] feel everything else. We might as well
[1:02:31] feel him.
[1:02:33] God is good. I'm trying to wait just to
[1:02:36] make sure I I don't want to miss
[1:02:37] anything that we're supposed to do.
[1:02:42] We've got a little time if we need it.
[1:02:45] It's still daylight
[1:02:46] outside. We're We're good for a few more
[1:02:48] minutes.
[1:02:50] Let me Let me have that microphone just
[1:02:53] a minute. Can
[1:02:55] you Who's going to play if I were to
[1:02:58] sing to Serve the Lord? You know it. You
[1:03:02] sure you know it?
[1:03:05] You're not going to mess me up.
[1:03:12] What key is it? Beth, do you
[1:03:16] remember from the
[1:03:19] dust of the
[1:03:21] earth? My
[1:03:24] God created
[1:03:27] man. His breath is what made
[1:03:32] man a living
[1:03:34] [Music]
[1:03:38] soul. For God so loved this world that
[1:03:45] he
[1:03:46] gave his only son.
[1:03:50] And that oh that is why I love him
[1:03:57] so I believe you know this for I was
[1:04:02] made in his
[1:04:05] likeness
[1:04:08] created in his image.
[1:04:12] For
[1:04:13] I Oh, I was born to serve the
[1:04:21] Lord. Oh, and I can't can deny him. I
[1:04:28] will
[1:04:29] always walk beside him. For
[1:04:34] I Oh, I was born to serve the Lord.
[1:04:41] That's my revelation tonight. Oh yes, my
[1:04:45] hands, they were
[1:04:48] made to
[1:04:51] help my
[1:04:53] neighbor and my
[1:04:56] eyes. They were made to read God's word.
[1:05:04] And in my feet they were
[1:05:09] made to
[1:05:12] walk in his
[1:05:15] footsteps. My
[1:05:17] body is the
[1:05:19] temple of the
[1:05:22] Lord. You believe you were singing
[1:05:25] tonight. I was
[1:05:27] made in his likeness. I was
[1:05:33] created in his
[1:05:36] image. For I Oh, I was born to
[1:05:43] serve the
[1:05:45] Lord. Oh, I
[1:05:49] can't deny him. I must
[1:05:53] always walk beside him.
[1:05:58] For
[1:05:59] I I was born to serve the
[1:06:05] Lord. I'm singing your life story. From
[1:06:08] the
[1:06:09] dust of the
[1:06:12] earth, our
[1:06:15] God created
[1:06:18] man. But it took his breath to make
[1:06:22] man a living soul.
[1:06:27] Oh, for God so loved this world that he
[1:06:35] gave his only
[1:06:38] son. And
[1:06:41] that that is why I love him.
[1:06:47] So sing it church. For I was
[1:06:51] made in his likeness.
[1:06:57] created in his
[1:06:59] image. For I I was born to serve the
[1:07:07] [Music]
[1:07:09] Lord.
[1:07:11] Oh, I
[1:07:13] can't deny him, but I
[1:07:18] must walk beside him. For I
[1:07:24] I was born to serve the Lord. Soft up
[1:07:30] here. Let me hear you. Before I was
[1:07:33] made,
[1:07:35] [Music]
[1:07:46] [Music]
[1:07:56] I
[1:07:57] can't deny
[1:08:00] him. I
[1:08:02] will walk beside him. For
[1:08:09] I was
[1:08:11] born to serve the Lord.
[1:08:19] [Music]
[1:08:24] Do you believe that
[1:08:27] tonight? I believe it.
[1:08:31] It's not just a song for me. It's a
[1:08:33] revelation.
[1:08:34] I know what I was born to do. To serve
[1:08:38] the Lord.
[1:08:40] I want to serve him with everything that
[1:08:42] I have. I'm uh running to make a hundred
[1:08:46] because 90 and nine and a half just
[1:08:48] won't do. Amen. We're not playing
[1:08:52] horseshoes here where where uh close,
[1:08:55] you know, close is enough. Oh, no. You
[1:08:58] got to have a ringer in this thing.
[1:09:01] Amen. You've got to have the full uh
[1:09:05] anchilada.
[1:09:08] Where did I get something like that? You
[1:09:10] got to run with everything you got. Did
[1:09:13] I embarrass my children when I said
[1:09:14] that? If I did, too bad. Let's thank the
[1:09:18] Lord for these musicians tonight and the
[1:09:22] singers. Thank God for a new set of
[1:09:25] drums. God is
[1:09:30] good. These are these are faithful men,
[1:09:37] volunteers. They give a lot. They do.
[1:09:41] They give a lot. These uh if you just
[1:09:44] are able, if you're able, remain
[1:09:45] standing. I'll I'll hurry. Uh these uh
[1:09:49] who do the streaming, who run the sound,
[1:09:52] charity, who runs the projector and the
[1:09:55] and the team that that helps her with
[1:09:58] the projector,
[1:10:00] uh the different aspects of the camera
[1:10:02] and the switchers and all that. There is
[1:10:05] a host of people on the other end of
[1:10:07] this camera tonight depending on this
[1:10:10] service.
[1:10:11] anticipating this service and
[1:10:13] brokenhearted that they couldn't be here
[1:10:16] physically in this service. Why don't
[1:10:18] you just do what Brother Shaw's doing
[1:10:19] and just way back there at them and tell
[1:10:22] them you love them and God bless you
[1:10:24] wherever you are. I don't know. I don't
[1:10:27] have my computer to tell you where the
[1:10:29] people are listening in, but but on
[1:10:30] Sunday they're they're listening in from
[1:10:33] Pakistan to Madagascar to Iceland to uh
[1:10:37] the Netherlands to Norway to Kenya to
[1:10:41] Ghana all across Africa. Uh we we have
[1:10:45] uh streamers over the course of a week
[1:10:48] from 30 to 35 different nations and they
[1:10:51] love they love you. They love the people
[1:10:55] and some are so faithful to stream they
[1:10:57] know you by name. Some of you here
[1:10:59] tonight you don't even know each other
[1:11:01] by name. And there's somebody on the
[1:11:04] other end of the line never been here
[1:11:05] physically and they come sometimes come
[1:11:08] for a visit and they'll just call out
[1:11:09] the names. They just have learned. Uh
[1:11:11] everybody God bless you all you
[1:11:13] streamers. Uh would you turn in your
[1:11:16] Bibles tonight? I'll read a couple
[1:11:18] verses and then let you have your seat.
[1:11:20] The reason why we do that is the most
[1:11:22] precious thing, the most precious thing
[1:11:26] that we have in this life, more precious
[1:11:29] than our own sweet families, is the word
[1:11:32] of God.
[1:11:34] It should be honored. It should be
[1:11:37] sanctified and set apart. and and uh I
[1:11:41] grew up in a in an era where in around
[1:11:44] the Pentecostal holiness type church
[1:11:47] where we were not even allowed to lay
[1:11:49] our Bible on the
[1:11:51] floor. Now I I I have had to do that and
[1:11:54] have done it on occasion but not growing
[1:11:56] up and um I got in trouble in India. I
[1:12:01] was in India doing television work and
[1:12:04] uh I am extremely uh flexible and I am
[1:12:08] able to uh uh cross my legs when I'm
[1:12:11] sitting in a chair for so long and and
[1:12:13] make my leg as flat as as a table and I
[1:12:17] could show you but you get the point.
[1:12:20] And so I often if I've been on there a
[1:12:22] while I would lay my Bible on my leg,
[1:12:26] not my foot, my leg like a table. And
[1:12:30] brother, I got in trouble. They said,
[1:12:32] "Your Bible is too close to your foot."
[1:12:35] And the in the in that culture, it it
[1:12:38] was disrespect. Uh we can go too far on
[1:12:41] anything. But remember, this is the most
[1:12:44] valuable thing that we have. God's love
[1:12:47] letter. It is for instruction. It's also
[1:12:51] for correction. Love is corrective. It's
[1:12:54] not all just embracing and tolerant.
[1:12:56] Love will correct us sometime. Do you
[1:12:58] believe that?
[1:12:59] Uh so to all of you, we're very thankful
[1:13:02] for all of you who are here. It's
[1:13:04] especially uh nice for me to see the
[1:13:07] real family because it's been so long
[1:13:09] since they've been here. I thought they
[1:13:11] had forgotten us all and and maybe we're
[1:13:14] waning in their love for us, but they've
[1:13:16] shown us now by being here tonight. Look
[1:13:18] at all those sweet children lined across
[1:13:20] there in front of their parents. Have
[1:13:22] come all the way from Indiana. I respect
[1:13:25] them greatly as as I do all of you
[1:13:27] who've come from Indiana and everywhere
[1:13:29] else you've come. And I found out
[1:13:31] Jerry's got a
[1:13:33] mom. I mean, everybody does, but I
[1:13:37] didn't know I'd ever get to meet her.
[1:13:39] Hebrews 7 verse 25. Wherefore he is able
[1:13:44] also to save them to the uttermost that
[1:13:49] come unto God by him, seeing he ever
[1:13:57] liveth. He ever liveth to make
[1:14:02] intercession for them. To
[1:14:05] paraphrase, to stand in the gap. Yes,
[1:14:08] sir. to cry out on their behalf. Did you
[1:14:11] know there's a blood that's crying out
[1:14:14] for you tonight?
[1:14:16] It it it it not only cried out the night
[1:14:19] that you accepted the life of the blood,
[1:14:22] but it's crying out on your behalf
[1:14:24] tonight. And it's a perfect blood. Yes,
[1:14:27] sir. There's not many perfect things
[1:14:29] that I know of, but I tell you, the
[1:14:31] blood of Jesus Christ specially created
[1:14:35] for the purpose of redemption. It's
[1:14:37] God's created blood. It wasn't the blood
[1:14:40] of Mary or the blood of Joseph. It was
[1:14:43] specifically created for your
[1:14:45] redemption. And it cries out on your
[1:14:49] behalf tonight. Thanks be unto God. But
[1:14:53] verse 26 uh blesses my blesser. It it
[1:14:58] makes me want to jump for such an high
[1:15:02] priest.
[1:15:07] I don't hear nobody. What does it say?
[1:15:12] For such an high priest
[1:15:16] became us.
[1:15:18] You You may be sitting there thinking,
[1:15:20] "What kind of a translation are you uh
[1:15:24] reading here tonight?" King James
[1:15:27] version
[1:15:29] 16:11.
[1:15:31] For such an high priest became us.
[1:15:36] I don't think you're reading it. I don't
[1:15:38] think you're hearing it or you'd be
[1:15:40] noisy.
[1:15:42] We don't just have a high priest who
[1:15:43] stood in our place,
[1:15:46] who came between us as an intercessor,
[1:15:49] but we have a high priest who became us.
[1:15:54] Who became a man,
[1:15:56] the son of God became a son of man,
[1:16:00] that we, the fallen sons of men, could
[1:16:03] become a son of God.
[1:16:05] This condescension is too big for my
[1:16:08] mind to wrap around. So I just have to
[1:16:11] shout over the reality that we have a
[1:16:14] high priest who not only cries out for
[1:16:17] us, who paid the price for us, but he
[1:16:20] became as one of us. And let me give you
[1:16:23] his description.
[1:16:25] Who? He is holy. Say holy. Holy. He is
[1:16:30] holy. Holy. Harmless. Harmless.
[1:16:34] undefiled. Undefiled. Separate from
[1:16:37] sinners. Separate from sinners. And made
[1:16:39] higher than the heavens.
[1:16:42] We're going to do that again. You might
[1:16:43] as well work something here tonight,
[1:16:45] too. We have such a high priest who
[1:16:48] became us. Who is holy, holy, harmless,
[1:16:52] harmless, undefiled, undeiled, separate
[1:16:55] from sinners, and made higher than the
[1:16:58] heavens.
[1:16:59] [Music]
[1:17:01] I don't have this for my text tonight,
[1:17:03] but the scripture said, "And in all
[1:17:05] manner, tempted as we are."
[1:17:09] That was the whole purpose of the
[1:17:11] condescension.
[1:17:12] That in all manner he may be tempted as
[1:17:15] we are. But don't forget those last
[1:17:17] three words, yet
[1:17:20] without sin.
[1:17:22] Lord Jesus, we have come here tonight
[1:17:25] not to see men, not to see women, not
[1:17:28] even to see these precious visitors. We
[1:17:31] have come here tonight to see you. You
[1:17:34] have wrapped yourself in your word. And
[1:17:38] I have just had the privilege of reading
[1:17:40] from the written record of your word.
[1:17:44] And Lord, I ask that you would come with
[1:17:46] your quickening life and let the very
[1:17:49] pages, the printed words on the page,
[1:17:52] may they live tonight. May they be
[1:17:55] personified among us tonight. And may we
[1:17:59] see you in these words because they are
[1:18:02] here to reveal to us who you are. Not
[1:18:06] only who you are, but who we are.
[1:18:10] because we know that what you are we
[1:18:13] have become. This is what the scripture
[1:18:16] has taught us. It's too grand for some
[1:18:19] folks. There are perhaps those among us
[1:18:22] who would rather dwell in the land of
[1:18:25] sinners and they like to continue to
[1:18:29] say, you know, I'm just a sinner saved
[1:18:32] by grace. But the reality is that we
[1:18:36] cannot be the both of those things
[1:18:39] because of who you are. We are in your
[1:18:43] eyes no more sinners but separate from
[1:18:48] sinners. And we are now holy, harmless,
[1:18:53] undefiled because of your blood on the
[1:18:57] doorpost uh and the lentil of our
[1:19:00] hearts. Lord Jesus, we owe you
[1:19:04] everything.
[1:19:05] None of us should be grumbling about a
[1:19:08] little standard or a little separated
[1:19:11] living from the world around us because
[1:19:14] we could never show you enough how
[1:19:17] grateful we are that you reach way below
[1:19:20] the bottom for us and made us who we are
[1:19:24] tonight. We give you glory now. We take
[1:19:27] authority over every foul and hindering,
[1:19:30] distracting spirit. We command you in
[1:19:33] the name of Jesus Christ to bow to the
[1:19:36] sovereignty and authority of the word.
[1:19:39] You have no place here. Uh take with you
[1:19:42] every sleepy spirit also that we might
[1:19:45] be alert, that we might be diligent,
[1:19:48] that we might be awake. If there has
[1:19:50] ever been an hour to be spiritually
[1:19:52] awake, it's 2025. Give us grace to
[1:19:56] demonstrate that tonight. We ask for
[1:19:59] your help in the name that is above
[1:20:01] every name, the exalted name of the Lord
[1:20:05] Jesus Christ, Bishm Adonai Yeshua
[1:20:08] Hamashiach. And the saint said, Amen.
[1:20:11] You may be seated. I have been in the
[1:20:15] word all day. And uh you when I get
[1:20:20] through preaching, you're going to
[1:20:21] think, well, you sure spent a lot of
[1:20:23] time pulling together something so
[1:20:25] simple. But I guess I spent part of the
[1:20:28] day wrestling with the Lord. Uh because
[1:20:31] I had something else in my mind. Uh what
[1:20:34] do you do when when your spiritual heart
[1:20:37] is h is at conflict with your own mind?
[1:20:40] Well, you better yield yourself. Uh come
[1:20:43] on now. When the Lord gets ready, we
[1:20:46] used to sing as a child, when the Lord
[1:20:47] gets ready, you better move and you
[1:20:49] better be willing to move. And you
[1:20:51] better be fluid. And you better not be
[1:20:54] so concrete and set your ways that God
[1:20:56] can't change your mind. Because he wants
[1:20:59] to do that sometime. Just know this. He
[1:21:01] never changes his mind about his word.
[1:21:04] If he said it, he means it. He's Jesus
[1:21:07] Christ tonight. the same yesterday and
[1:21:11] today and forever more. He changes not.
[1:21:15] That's right. I hope I don't offend you
[1:21:17] by reading those two verses again in an
[1:21:20] amplified version. I will tell you that
[1:21:22] I have checked them most carefully with
[1:21:25] the original. And I don't think I'll be
[1:21:27] leading you down a path of compromise to
[1:21:30] give you these verses. So bear with me.
[1:21:33] Therefore, he is able also to save to
[1:21:37] the
[1:21:38] uttermost. And this word uttermost is a
[1:21:42] Greek word that has several different
[1:21:45] applications. And the reason why I've
[1:21:47] used the amplified this evening is
[1:21:49] because in parentheses, the amplified
[1:21:52] has given us every meaning of the word
[1:21:55] uttermost. every meaning of the word
[1:21:58] that was in Greek that was translated in
[1:22:01] English uttermost. And so it gives us a
[1:22:04] very broad picture this evening. He is
[1:22:07] able also to save the uttermost
[1:22:10] completely,
[1:22:11] perfectly, finally. Whoop!
[1:22:15] Uh-huh. Finally. You're not saved one
[1:22:18] day and not saved the next day. Come on.
[1:22:22] You see, I'm almost a Baptist
[1:22:25] because I know that you're not on one
[1:22:28] minute and off the next If he's ever if
[1:22:32] you're really born again of the spirit
[1:22:35] of Jesus Christ, you you may walk away,
[1:22:40] slide away, slip away, but I'm telling
[1:22:42] you what, you're his. And he has a way
[1:22:46] of collecting that which belongs to him.
[1:22:49] He knows how to yank a knot in your
[1:22:51] head. That's right. He knows how to take
[1:22:54] you to the wood pile. He knows how to
[1:22:56] claim what he has purchased with his own
[1:22:59] blood. And you're going to go out of
[1:23:01] here as his.
[1:23:04] You may have many devils to face. You
[1:23:06] may have to wade through a lot of hell
[1:23:08] to get there. Are you saying we can't
[1:23:10] backslide? Oh, yes, you can backslide.
[1:23:13] It can be a temporary uh, you know,
[1:23:15] atmosphere in your life. You're cold.
[1:23:17] You're indifferent. you're you you're
[1:23:19] you're running after your own will and
[1:23:22] way. But that's not what we're talking
[1:23:24] about. We're talking about a God who is
[1:23:27] able to save you finally.
[1:23:31] You see, he offered his own blood and
[1:23:33] then sat down.
[1:23:35] Even on the cross, he cried out, "It is
[1:23:40] finished. The price has been paid."
[1:23:43] Amen. If brother Isaiah Brooks was here
[1:23:45] tonight, he could sing, "What more can
[1:23:48] he do?"
[1:23:50] The little chorus says, "He has uh
[1:23:53] opened up the way. What more can he do?"
[1:23:57] And that that is the reality. He has
[1:23:59] saved us, sanctified us by the washing
[1:24:02] of the water of the word, filled us
[1:24:05] through the new birth with the Holy
[1:24:07] Spirit. That's just the beginning.
[1:24:11] Here's where here's where the here's
[1:24:13] where I may, you know, I'm non-baptist
[1:24:16] now because I believe there is another
[1:24:19] touch of his glory that finishes that
[1:24:23] new birth. And the the the New Testament
[1:24:26] calls it the earnest, the baptism of the
[1:24:29] Holy Ghost and fire. I'm not a
[1:24:32] cessationist. I don't believe it's over.
[1:24:35] I believe he's still a miracle working
[1:24:37] God. If he wanted to, he could still
[1:24:40] raise the dead tonight.
[1:24:43] The Bible is still real. The word of God
[1:24:46] is still true. And there's never been a
[1:24:49] generation that needed the supernatural
[1:24:51] God anymore than the one we're living in
[1:24:53] right now.
[1:24:55] You believe that?
[1:24:57] And I have a church of Christ friend do
[1:24:59] pastors who who writes me for
[1:25:03] prayer because I had an opportunity to
[1:25:05] talk to him and show him some things.
[1:25:08] And though he hasn't made a complete
[1:25:10] shift away from his denomination, he is
[1:25:13] convinced that God is able to do today
[1:25:16] what he ever did. And he don't have to
[1:25:18] apologize to the apostles to do it. He
[1:25:21] just shows up. He's God. He's sovereign.
[1:25:24] Are you still with me? completely,
[1:25:26] perfectly, finally, and what? For all
[1:25:29] time and eternity. For all time and
[1:25:33] eternity. You might as well put a period
[1:25:35] on it. It's settled.
[1:25:38] those who come to God through him since
[1:25:42] he is always living to make petition
[1:25:46] intercession to God to intercede with
[1:25:50] him and intervene
[1:25:54] for them for them. Ain't that good?
[1:25:58] Here is the high
[1:26:00] priest. Now, here is where I think this
[1:26:05] version is slightly weaker.
[1:26:08] perfectly adapted to our
[1:26:12] needs. I think
[1:26:14] that there could have been a better
[1:26:17] choice of English words. Perhaps what we
[1:26:20] have in the King James became us.
[1:26:25] It may sound too base for some, but the
[1:26:28] revealed truth is pretty big here. He
[1:26:32] became what we are so that we by faith
[1:26:35] can become what he is.
[1:26:38] Amen. The same life that was in Jesus
[1:26:41] Christ is in his bride church today.
[1:26:45] Jesus said so. Yes, sir. He said in one
[1:26:48] place, I'll go away. I'm going to send
[1:26:50] you another comforter. And that's what
[1:26:52] confuses people and they start trying to
[1:26:54] make several people out of who God is.
[1:26:57] The problem is he's not interested in
[1:26:59] being people.
[1:27:01] [Music]
[1:27:03] He comes with offices, with attributes,
[1:27:05] with characteristics. He comes with with
[1:27:08] all of these beautiful things that he
[1:27:11] is. And I don't think we ought to limit
[1:27:14] him because he's counselor and he's
[1:27:16] wonderful God and he's king of the whole
[1:27:18] universe and he's lily of the valley.
[1:27:22] But when he chose to manifest himself as
[1:27:26] a person on this earth,
[1:27:28] he came in the form of the son
[1:27:32] and his name is Lord Jesus Christ. And
[1:27:37] Lord Jesus Christ said, "When you've
[1:27:39] seen me sir,
[1:27:42] you've seen the father because this is
[1:27:44] where he is. He's now embodied."
[1:27:48] We know that because John 1 tells us in
[1:27:51] the beginning was the word and the word
[1:27:53] was with God and the word was God and
[1:27:55] the word
[1:27:59] became the word that which was with God
[1:28:03] in the beginning took on a body of flesh
[1:28:06] and we know it's settled. Amen. So I I
[1:28:10] uh I like to call Jesus this really
[1:28:13] upsets people's little theology when I
[1:28:16] say well really Jesus is the only person
[1:28:18] in the Godhead
[1:28:20] because when God decided to be a person
[1:28:24] he came in the form of Jesus Christ. The
[1:28:28] original word there persona in the Greek
[1:28:31] doesn't mean a person today like what we
[1:28:34] think of three different individual
[1:28:36] people who may be related or they may
[1:28:39] share offices or something like that. It
[1:28:41] means something entirely different. It
[1:28:43] really means having a purpose. Persona
[1:28:47] is a purpose. It's a character. It's an
[1:28:49] attribute. It doesn't have to have a
[1:28:51] physical body.
[1:28:54] And so it's interesting to understand
[1:28:57] that sometimes the church has confused
[1:29:00] the word.
[1:29:02] May God give us help. May he keep
[1:29:04] anointing our eyes with Isaf. We thank
[1:29:06] the Lord for what he's done in the
[1:29:08] generation before us to help settle the
[1:29:11] matter.
[1:29:13] Amen. Loose ends from all the church
[1:29:15] ages hanging around. And God had to send
[1:29:18] someone like a tishbite to come in and
[1:29:21] weave those things together and help us
[1:29:24] to see the word of God. And this the
[1:29:27] devil and all of his imps cannot move
[1:29:30] you off the truth once it's become a
[1:29:32] reality and a revelation to who you are
[1:29:35] once it's been revealed to you.
[1:29:38] Oh, am I wearing you out already?
[1:29:41] I'm still on my introduction. Uh here is
[1:29:45] the high priest perfectly adapted to our
[1:29:48] needs as was fitting, holy, blameless,
[1:29:52] unstained by sin, separated from
[1:29:56] sinners, and exalted higher than the
[1:30:00] heavens. Somebody ought to say, "That's
[1:30:02] him." I want to preach this evening for
[1:30:05] some time. If I were to pick a title, I
[1:30:08] would go all the way back to the 90s and
[1:30:11] I would choose a title. This is a newly
[1:30:13] constructed message tonight, but uh but
[1:30:16] the title is a rerun. Is that okay? In
[1:30:19] the early 90s, maybe mid 90, not not
[1:30:22] early 90s. I think it would be mid to
[1:30:23] late 90s, uh I preached a a sermon or
[1:30:27] two on dead men walking. And some of you
[1:30:31] were there. And I want to take that
[1:30:33] title again tonight, dead man walking or
[1:30:37] dead men walking. Because the reality is
[1:30:40] only dead men can see the glory of the
[1:30:43] Lord. Is there anybody in here that
[1:30:45] wants to see the glory? I want to see it
[1:30:48] today and I want to see it again
[1:30:49] tomorrow.
[1:30:51] We are seeing we are
[1:30:53] experiencing visitations of of measures
[1:30:57] of his glory. Every time we come
[1:30:59] together, seated together in heavenly
[1:31:01] places in Christ Jesus, the glory of God
[1:31:04] is present. But we're looking for a full
[1:31:08] manifestation of cavode
[1:31:11] shakana shakina glory. And in that
[1:31:15] shakina glory, you get more than a
[1:31:17] feeling. You get more than a little
[1:31:20] jabber of tongues or some little
[1:31:22] something sensation or a goosebump or
[1:31:25] your hair is standing up. No. In the
[1:31:27] presence of the manifested glory of God,
[1:31:30] you're changed.
[1:31:33] And you may have been saved 35, 40
[1:31:35] years, but I'm telling you, there are
[1:31:37] still things in our lives tonight that
[1:31:40] we need change to come.
[1:31:43] Lord, I believe you've got levels and
[1:31:46] measures of change coming for us like we
[1:31:50] have only scratched the surface of
[1:31:53] Exodus
[1:31:54] 33:13. Now therefore, this is Moses
[1:31:57] praying to God in somewhat of a
[1:32:00] negotiation. Now therefore, I pray thee,
[1:32:03] if I have found grace in thy sight, show
[1:32:07] me now thy way, that I may know thee.
[1:32:11] When I hear that, I'm reminded of the
[1:32:13] apostle saying the same thing in the New
[1:32:16] Testament, that I may know him. That I
[1:32:19] may know him in the fellowship of his
[1:32:21] sufferings.
[1:32:23] I want you to know that this knowing is
[1:32:25] not a head knowledge. This knowing is a
[1:32:28] heart knowledge.
[1:32:30] We're going to have to be a people who
[1:32:32] let the word of God by the driving force
[1:32:36] of Holy Ghost drop from our head to our
[1:32:39] heart and eventually to our feet so that
[1:32:42] we can walk it out because we were born
[1:32:44] to serve the word. We were born to serve
[1:32:47] the Lord that I may know thee. That I
[1:32:49] may find grace in thy sight and consider
[1:32:53] that this nation is thy people. Then we
[1:32:56] drop to verse 17. These are familiar
[1:32:59] verses and we're going to move through
[1:33:01] them quickly. And the Lord said unto
[1:33:03] Moses, "I will do this thing also that
[1:33:06] thou hast spoken. For thou hast found
[1:33:09] grace in my sight, and I know thee by
[1:33:12] name." Doesn't that sound wonderful?
[1:33:15] What if I told you it wasn't only Moses
[1:33:18] that he knows by name? Anybody in this
[1:33:20] house believe that God knows you by
[1:33:23] name? He knows your address. He knows
[1:33:26] your uprising and your down setting. He
[1:33:29] knows your strengths and your
[1:33:31] weaknesses. He knows your good days and
[1:33:34] your bad days. And here's the glory. He
[1:33:38] loves you. He loves you. He loves you.
[1:33:42] He loves you in spite of it all. He
[1:33:45] could never love you any more than he
[1:33:46] does right now.
[1:33:49] Somebody said, "Well, he loved me so
[1:33:50] much when he saved me. He could never
[1:33:51] love you anymore than he loved you then.
[1:33:54] He could never love you any more than he
[1:33:55] loves you right now because his love is
[1:33:59] it it is unconditional. It is limitless.
[1:34:02] It is perfect.
[1:34:04] It knows no boundaries. It knows no
[1:34:06] conditions.
[1:34:08] When you don't serve and please him, he
[1:34:10] doesn't love you less.
[1:34:13] He loves you just as you were when he
[1:34:17] found you. You You didn't find him.
[1:34:20] Some of us weren't even looking for him.
[1:34:23] But he came looking for us. And he found
[1:34:26] us. Anybody want to say amen? He found
[1:34:29] us. And he found us in our sin. He found
[1:34:32] us in our mess. He found us in our
[1:34:35] stink.
[1:34:36] And he loved us anyway.
[1:34:39] For some, he found us in our dead, dry,
[1:34:41] cold, formal religion.
[1:34:43] Sitting on the church pew thinking we
[1:34:45] were all right. never having made a full
[1:34:48] surrender to the to the word. And yet he
[1:34:51] loved us. Hallelujah. He found some in
[1:34:55] the in the crack house. He found some in
[1:34:58] the wh house. He found some uh in the
[1:35:01] abortion clinic. He found some uh drunk
[1:35:04] on the on the side of the street. He
[1:35:07] found some strung out and found some who
[1:35:10] were living a perverted lifestyle. he
[1:35:13] found. But he loved them the same.
[1:35:18] If he found you in a place like that, he
[1:35:20] loved you that day just the same as he
[1:35:23] loved the preacher in the pull pit.
[1:35:26] But here's the reality. He loved you too
[1:35:29] much
[1:35:30] to leave you in that condition.
[1:35:34] Oh, I'm going to clap for the word
[1:35:36] myself.
[1:35:38] He loved you too much to leave you over
[1:35:41] there in that mess, in that pig pin, in
[1:35:45] that hell hole. He loved you too much to
[1:35:48] leave you there. So his hand reached
[1:35:50] further down than you could reach up. He
[1:35:52] pulled you up, called you his own,
[1:35:54] redeemed you with his own blood, saved
[1:35:56] you by his own grace,
[1:35:59] sanctified you by the washing of the
[1:36:01] water of the word. And and as Joel
[1:36:04] Hempill wrote the song, he's still
[1:36:06] working on me.
[1:36:12] Tell your neighbor, he's still working
[1:36:13] on me.
[1:36:15] Tell your neighbor, he's still working
[1:36:17] on you. Tell your neighbor, I sure am
[1:36:20] glad.
[1:36:23] I know he loves you too much to leave
[1:36:24] you as mean as you are right now. No,
[1:36:27] no, don't tell him that. You'll get in
[1:36:30] trouble. Verse
[1:36:32] 17. And the Lord said unto Moses, I will
[1:36:35] do this thing also that thou has spoken.
[1:36:38] For thou hast found grace in my sight,
[1:36:40] and I know thee by name. Thanks be to
[1:36:42] God. And he said, I beseech thee, show
[1:36:45] me, if you want me to read King James, I
[1:36:48] can. Shoo. Show me thy
[1:36:52] glory. And he said, I will make all my
[1:36:57] goodness pass before thee.
[1:37:01] Hallelujah. And I will proclaim the name
[1:37:05] of the Lord before thee.
[1:37:10] Yes. And here is something that the
[1:37:14] Calvinist and the Armenian uh group is
[1:37:17] still fighting over
[1:37:19] today. He said, "And I will be gracious
[1:37:22] to whom I will be gracious."
[1:37:29] It's election.
[1:37:32] It's beginning even in the older
[1:37:34] covenant. and will show mercy on whom I
[1:37:38] will show mercy. If you don't like that
[1:37:41] part of the book, I'm sorry. It's still
[1:37:43] a part of the book. Jacob, have I loved
[1:37:50] Now, how could God make such a
[1:37:52] commitment like that? Because he knew
[1:37:54] everything there was to know about
[1:37:56] Jacob. And he knew everything there was
[1:37:59] to know about Esau. And he knew their
[1:38:02] choice before they ever would make a
[1:38:04] choice. Did you know the Bible said
[1:38:06] before you ever arrived, all of your
[1:38:09] days were written in his book? Before
[1:38:12] you were ever forming in your mother's
[1:38:14] womb,
[1:38:16] he knew you. He knew your sin. He knew
[1:38:19] your your the day that you would say an
[1:38:21] eternal yes.
[1:38:25] So you don't have any surprises from
[1:38:27] him. Oh, thank God. Aren't you glad that
[1:38:31] you you don't have to worry about
[1:38:32] something catching up with you in him
[1:38:35] because he's got it covered. He saw it
[1:38:37] before you ever did it. That's what the
[1:38:39] word said. Oh, I know people get quiet
[1:38:42] and that makes me want to preach even
[1:38:43] more sometime. Hallelujah. The New Test
[1:38:46] You have not chosen me.
[1:38:49] That's right. But I have chosen you
[1:38:51] sayeth the Lord. How could that be?
[1:38:53] Because he uh because predestination is
[1:38:57] by fornowledge.
[1:38:59] That's what the New Testament says. It's
[1:39:01] not that God just lined people up not
[1:39:03] knowing anything about them and went
[1:39:05] down the line and said, "You'll be saved
[1:39:07] and you'll go to hell and you'll be
[1:39:08] saved and you'll go to hell." That is
[1:39:10] extreme Calvinism and it doesn't rest in
[1:39:14] the word. That sounds like the old
[1:39:16] primitive Baptist who used to preach
[1:39:18] that that if you shot your neighbor, you
[1:39:21] were predestinated to do it.
[1:39:25] Now, that is not Bible doctrine.
[1:39:28] You did it because you let your anger
[1:39:31] and your temper and your a and
[1:39:33] everything that had a hold of you
[1:39:35] override good sense because anybody that
[1:39:38] would throw their life away
[1:39:41] to execute vengeance for themselves
[1:39:44] is foolish. Vengeance is mine. I will
[1:39:48] repay, sayeth the Lord. If you just rest
[1:39:51] in him, I want you to know God keeps a
[1:39:53] record. There's going to be a payday for
[1:39:56] those who do wrong.
[1:39:58] may not come on Friday, but it's coming.
[1:40:01] And you better just, you and I better
[1:40:03] keep our hands off of it. Let God deal
[1:40:05] justly with his own. It's not up to us
[1:40:08] whether another man's servant stands or
[1:40:10] falls. Am I in the word? I believe I am.
[1:40:12] I'm in the word.
[1:40:14] So this uh this predestination is is by
[1:40:17] fornowledge. This election is by
[1:40:19] fornowledge.
[1:40:21] He knew you before you ever had an
[1:40:25] opportunity to know him. And because he
[1:40:29] saw your choice, he saw that little
[1:40:31] altar that you would kneel in or he saw
[1:40:33] you out on the tractor or he saw you in
[1:40:36] the little country church or where he
[1:40:38] saw you saying one big fat eternal yes
[1:40:41] to him.
[1:40:42] And in that moment, the scriptur is
[1:40:45] clear. The scripture is clear. In that
[1:40:48] moment, he knew everything there was to
[1:40:50] know about you and he assigned you a
[1:40:53] prefixed destiny.
[1:40:56] That's what it means. And and you're
[1:40:58] going to walk in that. You may you may
[1:41:00] move in and out of it. You may move in
[1:41:02] and out of perfect will. You may find
[1:41:05] yourself in permissive will at times
[1:41:08] what God will let you get by with. I
[1:41:10] would want to live my life in in what
[1:41:12] God lets me get by with. I want to live
[1:41:15] my life smack dab in the perfect plan of
[1:41:17] God for my life if it hair liips the
[1:41:20] devil and bankrupts hell.
[1:41:24] And you you won't just float there like
[1:41:26] a jellyfish. If you remain in the
[1:41:29] perfect will of God, you'll have to
[1:41:30] fight with everything. You've got to
[1:41:32] stay there because there's demons 10
[1:41:34] thousands times 10 thousands of demons
[1:41:37] loosed on the bride of Jesus Christ in
[1:41:39] the last hour doing everything they can
[1:41:41] to pull you back into some form of of
[1:41:44] unbelief
[1:41:46] because sin is unbelief. We hear brother
[1:41:49] Brandham making it very very clear. I
[1:41:52] was raised in the holiness church and
[1:41:55] everything was sin. this is sin and that
[1:41:58] is sin and the other is sin and and
[1:42:01] remember they didn't agree on what sin
[1:42:03] was and some churches said the women had
[1:42:05] to wear a hat I mean a big brim hat and
[1:42:08] others said you didn't have to and and
[1:42:10] then they started fighting one another
[1:42:12] and the preacher preached for a little
[1:42:15] country church of my granny's and said
[1:42:17] uh uh that drinking Coca-Cola would send
[1:42:19] you to hell and and she stopped you've
[1:42:22] heard the story stopped and said I
[1:42:23] brother I'm so sorry I'm driving they
[1:42:25] had 70 more miles I bank to get back to
[1:42:28] Columbus and said, "I I know you preach
[1:42:30] hard about a Coca-Cola, but I I I I
[1:42:32] don't I don't know that I'll get any
[1:42:34] coffee, but I need to go in there and
[1:42:36] get something that might help me stay
[1:42:38] alert or or we're going to end up in the
[1:42:40] ditch." And he said, "Why go right ahead
[1:42:42] and bring me a double
[1:42:45] cola? I I that's more
[1:42:49] caffeine." So So this preacher's sin was
[1:42:52] brand specific.
[1:42:55] You can get real confused in that kind
[1:42:56] of religion. Amen. I'm not I'm not I'm
[1:43:00] not ba b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b
[1:43:01] b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b
[1:43:01] b b bashing where I come from. I'm just
[1:43:03] so thankful to God that that the word is
[1:43:06] settled for me now. And I realize that
[1:43:08] sin is unbelief and all these other
[1:43:11] things, smoking, drinking, cheating,
[1:43:12] swearing, running here and there and
[1:43:14] what whatever you do. These are the
[1:43:16] attributes of unbelief. If you believe
[1:43:19] that God was a rewarder of those who
[1:43:21] diligently seek him, if you really
[1:43:23] believed what you say you believe, you
[1:43:26] would forsake those things. That's
[1:43:28] right. And walk in the path of
[1:43:30] righteousness and uprightness before the
[1:43:32] Lord. Let somebody say, "Amen."
[1:43:36] Then you don't have to worry about how
[1:43:37] short is short and how long is long and
[1:43:39] all these religious arguments that
[1:43:41] religious people have. Stay out of that.
[1:43:45] God said to Moses, "I'm going let all my
[1:43:47] goodness pass before thee, and I will
[1:43:48] proclaim the name of the Lord before
[1:43:50] thee. I'll be gracious and so forth and
[1:43:53] etc." Now, look at verse 20. And we're
[1:43:55] going somewhere. Just take us a little
[1:43:57] while to get there. And he said, "Thou
[1:43:59] canst not. Thou canst not." You said,
[1:44:02] "See my glory, but thou canst not see my
[1:44:05] face.
[1:44:07] For there shall no man see me
[1:44:11] and
[1:44:13] live dead men walking.
[1:44:18] The only way to see the glory of God is
[1:44:21] as a dead man.
[1:44:26] I'm preaching.
[1:44:28] Oh yes. The only way to encounter the
[1:44:31] fullness of the glory of God is to do it
[1:44:33] as a dead man. Now I'm not talking about
[1:44:35] the undertaker. and the funeral home and
[1:44:39] the casket. That's not the kind of dead
[1:44:42] I'm talking about. I'm talking about an
[1:44:44] entirely different kind of dead. The New
[1:44:47] Testament kind of dead.
[1:44:50] God is plain. He said, "You won't see my
[1:44:53] face and live."
[1:44:56] The Lord said, "Behold, there is a place
[1:44:58] by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock,
[1:45:02] and it shall come to pass, while my
[1:45:04] glory passeth by, I will put thee in a
[1:45:08] in a smitten place,
[1:45:11] in a cliff of the rock, and will cover
[1:45:14] thee with my
[1:45:16] hands while I pass by, and will take
[1:45:20] away mine hand, and thou shalt see my
[1:45:24] hinder parts.
[1:45:26] my back
[1:45:27] parts, but my face shall not be seen.
[1:45:32] What Moses received on the mount was a
[1:45:34] revelation of where God had been and
[1:45:37] what God had done. Somebody said, "How
[1:45:40] do you know that?" Because it was Moses
[1:45:43] through a scribe that wrote the first
[1:45:45] five books of the Bible that are
[1:45:47] contained on that handwritten scroll
[1:45:49] right there. He did it through a scribe.
[1:45:52] And if you'll look at the first five
[1:45:54] books of the Bible, you'll look at the
[1:45:56] very first verse of the Bible. In the
[1:45:58] beginning, God. Now, how in the world
[1:46:00] could Moses through a scribe write the
[1:46:04] creation story?
[1:46:07] If he hadn't been there in creation,
[1:46:11] it's because there on that mountain, God
[1:46:13] said, "I'm going to give you my hinder
[1:46:16] parts. I'm going to show you my
[1:46:17] backside. I'm going to reveal to you
[1:46:20] what I have done, what I have been. I'm
[1:46:24] going to let you know it. And it was
[1:46:26] very important that he received this
[1:46:28] revelation or we would be missing some
[1:46:31] great books of the Bible. How did he
[1:46:34] know that God said there shall be light?
[1:46:38] It shall be light. Let there be light.
[1:46:41] How did Moses know? I mean, how did he
[1:46:43] know? He learned in this revelatory
[1:46:47] experience. And we're not stretching
[1:46:48] things. I have multiple places that we
[1:46:51] could go, but this is not the focus of
[1:46:53] this little message here tonight. I I
[1:46:55] want you to know I'm not satisfied
[1:46:58] knowing where God has been only.
[1:47:02] My heart is hungering to know where God
[1:47:04] is now. I want to know what he's doing
[1:47:07] now.
[1:47:09] I'm interested in learning about what he
[1:47:11] did in 50s and 60s. But I'm also very
[1:47:14] hungry, very desirous to know what he
[1:47:17] wants to do, what he is doing, what he
[1:47:20] would like to do uh in the today.
[1:47:23] Not only that, I have a heart to know
[1:47:25] what he's going to do tomorrow. I'd like
[1:47:28] to know where God is taking this little
[1:47:30] bride. Well, I know I know some of these
[1:47:33] things, but I wouldn't have known them
[1:47:35] had God not sent a word to help reveal
[1:47:37] it to us. We would have never known that
[1:47:40] there's going to be a people for a quick
[1:47:42] short period of time on planet Earth who
[1:47:45] will operate in the full manifestation
[1:47:48] of the power of God and in the
[1:47:52] authority of God. We wouldn't have known
[1:47:55] that the same creative word that
[1:47:58] produced miracles in the New Testament
[1:48:01] is the same creative word that can
[1:48:03] produce miracles today.
[1:48:06] And we would have never understood the
[1:48:08] benefits of full adoption by the Holy
[1:48:11] Spirit. We're not talking about uh just
[1:48:15] technons
[1:48:16] which are you know toddlers. We're
[1:48:18] talking about whos sons who are mature
[1:48:22] sons. And I want you to know something
[1:48:24] right now. God is getting together a
[1:48:27] company of mature sons. He's been
[1:48:30] working on them for years now since he
[1:48:33] restored the word. And as soon as we
[1:48:36] start letting the main thing be the main
[1:48:38] thing,
[1:48:42] are you here? As soon as we start
[1:48:45] letting the main thing be the main
[1:48:46] thing, we'll begin to see more of that
[1:48:50] kind of glory among us.
[1:48:53] Do you believe that it's still possible
[1:48:56] with that creative word to speak to
[1:48:58] cancer?
[1:48:59] [Music]
[1:49:02] Oh, it's going to get quiet now.
[1:49:05] It's It's vitally important that we get
[1:49:08] this.
[1:49:10] I heard that little prophet tell that
[1:49:13] before the doctor's
[1:49:16] hand will touch her,
[1:49:19] that tumor will disappear.
[1:49:22] Hallelujah. He's off preaching in shrimp
[1:49:24] port. Sister Ma's uh going to the doctor
[1:49:28] and she has to go back and she's going
[1:49:30] for a final examination before
[1:49:33] surgery and uh she's in her gown. She's
[1:49:37] sitting there and as the doctor reaches
[1:49:39] toward her to examine this tumor, it's
[1:49:43] gone. That's right. Now, somebody said,
[1:49:46] "I wasn't there. I don't know whether to
[1:49:47] believe it or not." Well, I'll tell you
[1:49:49] what I have found. It's easier to
[1:49:50] believe that God is than to believe that
[1:49:53] he's not.
[1:49:56] If you'll believe he will, if you
[1:49:57] believe he is, if you believe he can, if
[1:50:00] you'll let faith do the work, there's no
[1:50:03] telling what God can do in your life.
[1:50:06] Does he always Does he is it the way we
[1:50:08] want it to be every time? Does it always
[1:50:10] turn out the way we hope? No. It doesn't
[1:50:13] always turn out the way we hope. But we
[1:50:15] don't have to get all been out of shape
[1:50:17] about that either because we know he's a
[1:50:19] sovereign God who never makes a mistake,
[1:50:22] who never gets caught by surprise.
[1:50:27] So it doesn't matter how sorry the
[1:50:29] doctor was, how lousy the hospital was,
[1:50:31] how poisoned the medicine was.
[1:50:35] Uh-oh.
[1:50:37] You and I aren't going anywhere till the
[1:50:39] Lord calls us.
[1:50:41] And he won't call us until the day our
[1:50:43] end of days has come. There's no more
[1:50:45] days, no more pages in God's record of
[1:50:49] our life. And we're going out of here.
[1:50:51] And some will go uh up into their 80s
[1:50:53] and 90s and maybe a hundred. And others
[1:50:56] will go young and we don't like it. It
[1:50:58] hurts our heart. We don't understand it.
[1:51:01] But we have to say with David,
[1:51:04] blessed be the name of the Lord. The
[1:51:06] Lord giveth and the Lord and the Lord
[1:51:09] taketh away.
[1:51:11] And you you can't have it both ways.
[1:51:14] The devil, somebody said, "Well, the
[1:51:16] devil just got in and killed old so and
[1:51:18] so and so and so." You know what? I
[1:51:20] wouldn't serve a God if I were you. I
[1:51:22] wouldn't serve a God that had less power
[1:51:25] than his enemy. That's right.
[1:51:27] If the enemy can sneak in and kill you
[1:51:30] against God's timing in your life, that
[1:51:32] places his enemy in a position of more
[1:51:35] power than he has. I don't serve a God
[1:51:38] like that. The God I serve is more than
[1:51:43] enough in every situation at all times
[1:51:47] if you and I can trust him. Amen.
[1:51:51] I'm going to let you see some things. So
[1:51:54] this verse gives birth to a spiritual
[1:51:57] paradox. To truly see God in the
[1:52:00] fullness of his glory and the fullness
[1:52:02] of his authority, you got to be
[1:52:05] dead. Not physically dead, but inwardly
[1:52:07] dead. Dead to self, dead to sin, dead to
[1:52:10] pride, dead to the flesh. Sounds easy.
[1:52:14] We can just will it so. But it's a
[1:52:17] little more difficult than that. You
[1:52:19] see, no man in his natural fallen state
[1:52:21] can bear to see the glory, the fullness
[1:52:25] of the glory of God face to face and
[1:52:28] survive. That's right. Because only dead
[1:52:30] men see God. There is a divine
[1:52:33] connection between glory and death. Dead
[1:52:36] man walking. When a condemned man begins
[1:52:41] his final walk to the death chamber
[1:52:45] where his execution is about to take
[1:52:48] place. Either the warden or the chief
[1:52:52] guard will often shout down the hall so
[1:52:56] that all of the other prisoners perhaps
[1:52:59] also on death row can hear. He screams
[1:53:03] out dead man walking.
[1:53:07] The reality is he's not physically dead
[1:53:09] yet. He's headed to his physical death.
[1:53:14] But in the eyes of the warden and in the
[1:53:16] eyes of the of the of the prisoner and
[1:53:20] in the eyes of his prison buddies, they
[1:53:23] know that his death is as sure and as
[1:53:27] certain as the next breath he takes on
[1:53:29] the way over there. And and so this lets
[1:53:33] everyone know that a man is spending his
[1:53:36] last few moments of
[1:53:38] life on this earth and that they should
[1:53:42] be still and that they should honor
[1:53:45] those last few moments of his life.
[1:53:47] Somebody said, "I I I don't go along
[1:53:49] with that." And I can understand if
[1:53:51] you're the victim or the family of a
[1:53:53] victim. I can understand how those
[1:53:55] things would build up in your heart. But
[1:53:57] the reality is our justice system allows
[1:54:00] that condemned man to have a last meal.
[1:54:04] Yes, sir. He gets to choose what he
[1:54:07] swallows last, what his body begins to
[1:54:10] digest last. In fact, once upon a time,
[1:54:14] there were these things called
[1:54:16] newspapers, and they they came to the
[1:54:19] house. They were delivered to your
[1:54:21] house. You didn't have satellite to get
[1:54:24] the news. You went down to the not the
[1:54:26] mailbox, the newspaper box. Did anybody
[1:54:30] ever have one? And and you go and take
[1:54:33] it out and it gets wrinkled. And if it
[1:54:34] belongs to my papa, you better not get
[1:54:37] the sections mixed up when you put it
[1:54:39] back, fold it up, and hand it to him. It
[1:54:41] better be just like it was supposed to
[1:54:43] come. They used to even publish in the
[1:54:46] newspaper uh the meal, what the last
[1:54:48] meal was. Someone would want steak and a
[1:54:51] baked potato and a salad and some people
[1:54:54] would want a a Big Mac. Imagine
[1:54:57] that. I don't want a Big Mac now. I
[1:55:00] shouldn't certainly wouldn't want it to
[1:55:02] be my last meal on the earth. I I would
[1:55:05] read sometime growing up that some would
[1:55:08] refuse a last meal.
[1:55:11] They they're so uh they're so uh
[1:55:13] overwhelmed perhaps with emotion of
[1:55:15] what's taking place, they don't even
[1:55:18] want a last meal. I don't know what the
[1:55:20] reason is, but they don't even want a
[1:55:22] last
[1:55:23] meal. I hope I never find myself in that
[1:55:27] position, but knowing how I enjoy food,
[1:55:31] brother Jason, I I have a feeling I'd
[1:55:33] order something.
[1:55:35] But regardless of that, uh, you may have
[1:55:38] seen, some have seen a film, a movie was
[1:55:40] famous some years ago, some may have
[1:55:43] seen a documentary, some may have read a
[1:55:45] true crime book. And, and you know what
[1:55:47] I'm talking about. Dead man
[1:55:49] walking. And there he shuffles down the
[1:55:53] down the aisle, the hallway of that
[1:55:57] prison with shackles on his feet, and he
[1:56:01] is making his way to his death. whether
[1:56:05] it be by lethal injection or firing
[1:56:08] squad because I understand that in some
[1:56:11] places that is being reinstituted in
[1:56:13] this hour uh used to be by electric
[1:56:16] chair. I'm not saying anything for or
[1:56:19] against uh this kind of punishment, not
[1:56:23] in this sermon tonight. If you want to
[1:56:25] know my opinion, you can ask me later.
[1:56:27] That's not the point of what we're
[1:56:29] talking about tonight. But the reality
[1:56:31] is he's walking, but he's already dead.
[1:56:35] In his mind, he's already dead. In the
[1:56:37] warden's mind, he's already dead. In the
[1:56:40] other prisoner's mind, he's already
[1:56:41] dead. And this is exactly not a
[1:56:43] criminal, not a murderer. But remember,
[1:56:46] every one of us were filthy, undone,
[1:56:49] rotten, sorry, without God. If you read
[1:56:52] the Bible, I read no sin is greater or
[1:56:55] worse, more vile, more awful than the
[1:56:59] next. Let's see if you can I know it's
[1:57:02] hard to get Republicans to say amen to
[1:57:05] something like that. But maybe some of
[1:57:06] you who might be one can scream out
[1:57:08] amen. It's the truth anyhow. It doesn't
[1:57:11] matter whether it's homosexuality or
[1:57:13] it's a some kind of abuse or whether
[1:57:15] it's murder. In the eyes of God, the
[1:57:18] ground is level at the foot of the
[1:57:19] cross. If we come to him and ask,
[1:57:23] he is faithful and just to forgive us of
[1:57:25] our sins. So said the scripture.
[1:57:29] And so we're we're not we're not in some
[1:57:31] contest here to see who's who's a worse
[1:57:34] sinner. That's right. Or who's just a
[1:57:37] little sinner. Just scratching the
[1:57:38] surface. Listen, unbelief is sin. Every
[1:57:42] one of us in this house at one time or
[1:57:44] another deserve death.
[1:57:46] We deserved an eternal punishment of
[1:57:49] some kind.
[1:57:51] I hold to what the scripture says. The
[1:57:53] soul that sinnth shall surely die.
[1:57:56] That's what the scripture said. I don't
[1:57:58] know how long. I don't know how it all
[1:58:00] works. I'm not concerned about that. But
[1:58:02] I know this. To be eternally separated
[1:58:06] from God is the worst punishment.
[1:58:10] It's worse than an electric chair. It's
[1:58:13] worse than what you can do to this
[1:58:14] physical body. to know that forever and
[1:58:17] ever your name is even blotted out of
[1:58:20] the book of life. It is as though you
[1:58:23] never even existed.
[1:58:26] And you are so eternally separated from
[1:58:29] God. You will never again have any God
[1:58:32] consciousness.
[1:58:33] And even a vile sinner on the street has
[1:58:36] a measure of God consciousness in the
[1:58:39] hour we're living today, particularly in
[1:58:41] the Bible belt. He at least knows. He at
[1:58:45] least at times senses
[1:58:48] there's a payday.
[1:58:50] You'll hear hear them say, "I I know
[1:58:53] that one day it's going to catch up with
[1:58:55] me." The reality is you can't come to
[1:58:58] him when you get good and well ready.
[1:59:00] You better come when he tugs.
[1:59:03] The Bible tells us, "My spirit shall not
[1:59:05] always strive with man." Are you with me
[1:59:08] still? Now, I want you to know that
[1:59:10] Exodus 25:8-9 tells us, "I'm hurrying.
[1:59:14] This is my hurry.
[1:59:16] Uh, Exodus 25:8-9 tells us that Moses
[1:59:19] while he was up in that mountain getting
[1:59:21] revelation from God, God let him see the
[1:59:24] sanctuary.
[1:59:25] He saw the heavenly uh sanctuary. And he
[1:59:30] was told in verse 9, according to all
[1:59:32] that I show thee, after the pattern of
[1:59:34] the tabernacle, after the pattern of all
[1:59:36] the instruments thereof, so even so
[1:59:39] shall you make it. He was caught right
[1:59:41] up into the heavenly realm before the
[1:59:43] throne. He saw what it would be. He was
[1:59:47] given a plan, a blueprint of how to
[1:59:49] build that as a sanctuary, the Mishkan
[1:59:52] or the tabernacle in the wilderness. I
[1:59:55] would say that he was certainly in
[1:59:57] heavenly places in that moment. And yet,
[2:00:02] he longed yet
[2:00:05] to see the glory. That's right. He
[2:00:08] already saw the miracle power. He
[2:00:10] already saw that God was capable of
[2:00:12] doing the impossible again and again and
[2:00:15] again. And yet at the end of all that he
[2:00:18] saw God doing supernaturally and
[2:00:20] miraculously and even after receiving a
[2:00:23] blueprint of a heavenly sanctuary that
[2:00:26] he was to reconstruct on the earth as a
[2:00:28] place where God would dwell with man.
[2:00:31] After all of that, he still finds
[2:00:33] himself crying out, "Lord,
[2:00:37] Show me
[2:00:40] thy glory.
[2:00:43] Anybody here hungry
[2:00:45] to see the full manifestation of the
[2:00:48] glory of God? It's revealed in his word.
[2:00:53] It's there. We know what it
[2:00:54] accomplishes. We know what it looks
[2:00:56] like. We know what it has power to do.
[2:00:59] And we desire it. We're tired. I'm tired
[2:01:03] of dead dry formal religion. I'm tired
[2:01:07] of church as usual. I want to see God
[2:01:10] show up and deliver. Not just save a
[2:01:13] sinner, deliver a sinner right out of
[2:01:17] the clutches of addiction.
[2:01:20] Is he still able
[2:01:23] than able? Hebrews 8 and5. Put it up
[2:01:26] there. Hebrews 8 and5. who serve under
[2:01:30] the example and shadow of heavenly
[2:01:31] things. As Moses was admonished of God
[2:01:34] when he was about to make the
[2:01:35] tabernacle, seeith he that thou make all
[2:01:38] things according to the pattern showed
[2:01:39] thee in the mount. So, we know that God
[2:01:42] showed it to him first and then told him
[2:01:44] and then God gave him a craftsman,
[2:01:46] didn't he, to help make that all become
[2:01:48] a
[2:01:50] reality. Dead men walking. Only dead men
[2:01:54] see the glory. Look at Romans 12 with me
[2:01:57] just a moment. 1 and two. I beseech you
[2:01:59] therefore, brethren, by the mercies of
[2:02:01] God, that you present your
[2:02:03] body, excuse me, Romans 12:1 and
[2:02:07] two. I beseech you therefore, brethren,
[2:02:09] am I right? Am I Did I miss it? By the
[2:02:12] mercies of God, that you present your
[2:02:14] bodies a living sacrifice. Who has ever
[2:02:16] heard of a living sacrifice?
[2:02:19] In order for something to be a sacrifice
[2:02:21] on the altar, it has to be what? Dead.
[2:02:24] God said, "I have a new and living way."
[2:02:26] Isn't that what he said? I have a new
[2:02:28] covenant to make with you. And now I'm
[2:02:31] not asking you to be physically dead.
[2:02:34] I'm asking you to be a living sacrifice.
[2:02:37] But there are some things in your life
[2:02:39] you're going to have to be dead to. Dead
[2:02:42] to
[2:02:44] There's some things that you're going to
[2:02:45] have to be dead to.
[2:02:48] A living sacrifice, holy, acceptable
[2:02:50] unto God, which is the least you can do.
[2:02:53] It's your reasonable service. The
[2:02:54] apostle said, "And be not what?"
[2:02:57] I want you to write these verses down.
[2:02:59] Read them tonight. Read them tomorrow.
[2:03:01] Read them. Read them. Read them. Read
[2:03:02] them. Until they become a part of who
[2:03:04] you are. Be not conformed to this world,
[2:03:06] but be yeformed.
[2:03:08] That's the glory.
[2:03:11] That's the full manifestation of God's
[2:03:14] spirit and power. Transforming power.
[2:03:17] Transforming glory. Yes, sir.
[2:03:19] Hallelujah. when just a portion of that
[2:03:22] heavy glory came in the temple that had
[2:03:25] been built uh Solomon had overseen the
[2:03:28] building of this temple. When that glory
[2:03:30] began to come, the glory cloud filled
[2:03:33] the house. And the Bible said the
[2:03:35] priests could not stand to minister by
[2:03:37] reason of the cloud. Send it on in here,
[2:03:39] Lord.
[2:03:42] Send it on in here, Lord. How do we know
[2:03:44] it exists? Because the word is opened.
[2:03:46] That's right. It's true. And if we're
[2:03:48] here uh uh if we're here fellowshipping
[2:03:51] the revealed word, then everything
[2:03:52] that's in that word is available to us.
[2:03:56] And it's not impossible that God would
[2:03:58] come. I don't care whether I see a cloud
[2:04:00] or not. I don't care whether I see a
[2:04:02] pillar of fire or not. What I care about
[2:04:05] is that transforming glory, the
[2:04:08] transforming spirit of almighty God fall
[2:04:11] on your life. I don't care whether you
[2:04:14] shout. I don't care whether you're
[2:04:16] talking in tongues. I don't care whether
[2:04:18] you dance. I want to see you
[2:04:20] transformed.
[2:04:22] It doesn't matter if I feel it or I
[2:04:24] don't feel it. I just want to know that
[2:04:27] I have had fellowship with the
[2:04:29] transforming glory.
[2:04:33] That's right.
[2:04:37] Hallelujah.
[2:04:39] Only dead men can see God. It's a
[2:04:42] reality.
[2:04:44] I want you to look now at 1 Corinthians
[2:04:47] 1. Just a moment. There's going to be a
[2:04:48] lot of word here. I got to hurry. Oh my,
[2:04:50] I'm feeling pressure now. But God hath
[2:04:52] chosen the foolish things of the world
[2:04:54] to confound the wise. And God hath
[2:04:56] chosen the weak things of the world to
[2:04:57] confound the things which are mighty,
[2:04:59] and base things of the world, and things
[2:05:01] which are despised. Hath God chosen yay
[2:05:03] in things which are
[2:05:06] not to bring to
[2:05:09] not things that
[2:05:11] are that
[2:05:13] what would you read it again? No flesh
[2:05:17] should
[2:05:18] glory in his presence. No flesh is going
[2:05:22] to get into that kind of presence
[2:05:25] because only dead men
[2:05:28] get that close to God.
[2:05:31] If there's flesh present, when the glory
[2:05:34] of God fills, the transforming glory of
[2:05:37] God comes. And there's nothing like the
[2:05:38] word to usher it in. And if that glory
[2:05:42] comes, I want you to know if there's any
[2:05:43] flesh present, it'll have to be dead
[2:05:45] flesh
[2:05:47] because only dead men can see the face
[2:05:49] of God. Let me show you one other thing
[2:05:51] here before we move to something else.
[2:05:52] Leviticus 16 12-4. He shall take a
[2:05:56] sensor full of burning coals of fire
[2:05:58] from off the altar before the Lord, and
[2:06:00] his hands, both hands full of sweet
[2:06:02] incense beaten small, and bring it
[2:06:04] within the veil. And he shall put the
[2:06:06] incense upon the fire before the Lord,
[2:06:08] that the cloud of the incense may cover
[2:06:10] the mercy seat that is upon the
[2:06:16] testimony. You see, Almighty God, I will
[2:06:19] I will meet you. I is part of the it's
[2:06:23] part of the very mandate of the
[2:06:24] tabernacle in the wilderness. I will
[2:06:26] meet you there between the
[2:06:29] wings of the cherubam.
[2:06:33] I will meet you there between the wings
[2:06:36] of the cherubim.
[2:06:38] Now this is a meeting. This is a this is
[2:06:41] a moed. This is a divine
[2:06:43] appointment. God said I'm going to meet
[2:06:45] you there.
[2:06:46] I'm going to do it once a year in the
[2:06:48] old covenant called the day of
[2:06:50] atonement. And the priest went in uh it
[2:06:54] was a big ordeal, but he went in and he
[2:06:57] went in with two hands full of incense
[2:06:59] to drop on the on the coals of the
[2:07:01] sensor and the smoke begin to rise up it
[2:07:04] became so thick.
[2:07:06] He shall put the incense upon the fire
[2:07:08] before the Lord that the cloud of the
[2:07:10] incense may cover the mercy seat that is
[2:07:12] upon the ark of the testimony that he
[2:07:15] die not. There's the ark of the
[2:07:17] covenant. Upon that is the lid that we
[2:07:19] understand to be the mercy seat. On
[2:07:21] either side the cherubims are are facing
[2:07:24] one another. The tips of their wings
[2:07:25] touching. And God said, "I'll meet you
[2:07:27] there. I'll meet you there. I'll meet
[2:07:30] you there on the mercy seat." Do you
[2:07:32] understand? I'll meet you there on the
[2:07:34] mercy seat. I'll meet you where the
[2:07:36] blood is applied. That's where I'm going
[2:07:38] to meet you. That's where I'm going to
[2:07:39] show up. Now, you and I have got to
[2:07:41] figure out how to get from out here to
[2:07:43] in there. And the word makes it clear,
[2:07:47] sir. The word makes it clear. Even under
[2:07:49] the old covenant, a priest couldn't just
[2:07:51] walk in, you know,
[2:07:55] shirt all hanging out
[2:07:57] and hair all down his back and no, there
[2:08:02] was a protocol to enter the holy. That's
[2:08:04] right. Hear me, sir. I won't elaborate.
[2:08:08] I feel you squirming. I feel somebody
[2:08:10] squirming. No need for that. There was a
[2:08:13] protocol. And the only thing that we're
[2:08:16] reading about here is he's going to have
[2:08:18] to offer two handfuls of incense on the
[2:08:20] on these holy colds, these colds of the
[2:08:22] holy inser uh s uh in incense on the
[2:08:25] holy sensor and it's going to rise up
[2:08:28] such a cloud that he die
[2:08:30] not. That's what it says, isn't it? And
[2:08:34] he shall take of the blood of the bulock
[2:08:36] and sprinkle it with his finger like
[2:08:38] this upon the mercy seat eastward and
[2:08:41] before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle
[2:08:43] of the blood with his finger. How many
[2:08:44] times? Seven times. Seven times. The
[2:08:47] number of perfection and completion in
[2:08:49] Hebrew. The Hebrews were so cautious
[2:08:52] about avoiding defilement that the that
[2:08:54] the high priest could not even sleep the
[2:08:57] night before he was to go in behind the
[2:08:59] veil, lest he have a dream that would
[2:09:02] defile and and disqualify him from going
[2:09:05] into the presence of that cavode glory,
[2:09:10] that heavy glory. So his priest buddies
[2:09:13] would keep him up all night reading the
[2:09:15] law and discussing the the instructions
[2:09:18] so that he wouldn't perhaps go to sleep
[2:09:20] and have a vile dream. The incense when
[2:09:23] it was dropped on top of the hot embers
[2:09:25] would create a thick billowing cloud of
[2:09:27] sweet smelling smoke and the priest
[2:09:29] would reach the sensor into the Holy of
[2:09:32] Holies
[2:09:33] first and swing it back and
[2:09:37] forth so that that smoke would begin to
[2:09:40] billow and would begin to build and fill
[2:09:44] the chamber.
[2:09:45] All the sprinkling of blood was done by
[2:09:47] feeling instead of by sight because the
[2:09:52] smoke was covering the priest
[2:09:55] symbolically hiding his flesh.
[2:09:59] Come on. Not just to keep man from
[2:10:01] seeing the fullness of God's glory, but
[2:10:03] to symbolically block God's view
[2:10:07] of his fallen flesh.
[2:10:10] Hallelujah.
[2:10:12] Frank Bartleman, an eyewitness of the
[2:10:14] ISUsa Street revival, said, "The depth
[2:10:17] of your repentance will determine the
[2:10:20] height of your revival."
[2:10:23] [Music]
[2:10:25] There is no denominational revival
[2:10:28] promised yet to America, but there is a
[2:10:31] revival promised.
[2:10:33] It's a bride's
[2:10:35] revival. It's a fullness of adoption. It
[2:10:39] moves us from the immaturity of Technon
[2:10:42] sons to the maturity of we sons. And the
[2:10:46] reason why we need to make that
[2:10:48] transition is because as mature sons,
[2:10:51] your name on the
[2:10:53] check carries the full authority of his.
[2:10:59] You lose your identity as a Baptist or a
[2:11:02] Methodist or a Pentecostal or a holiness
[2:11:04] or whatever, even as a message believer.
[2:11:07] You lose all of that kind of identity
[2:11:10] and you become something entirely
[2:11:12] different. You are a new creature in
[2:11:15] Christ. You have grown up into the
[2:11:18] stature of the fullness of the perfect
[2:11:21] man.
[2:11:23] Yes, sir. Peter's not just talking about
[2:11:26] perfect men. He's talking about the
[2:11:28] fullness of the stature of the perfect
[2:11:31] man
[2:11:33] who had to come down to make it possible
[2:11:37] for you and I to go up. But in this
[2:11:40] bride's revival, there is a measure of
[2:11:43] preparation like any revival that we
[2:11:45] have ever had. And there would be those
[2:11:48] who would tell you that if you hear the
[2:11:50] right tape or you believe the thunders
[2:11:52] the right way or if you believe that all
[2:11:54] of the seventh seal is made known,
[2:11:56] you're you're already in the greatest
[2:11:58] revival that you've ever had. I have a
[2:12:00] few problems with that that we don't
[2:12:03] have time to talk about tonight, but we
[2:12:05] will in the near future because if that
[2:12:08] has already taken place, it's got to be
[2:12:11] more than miracles. It's got to be more
[2:12:14] than cancer healed.
[2:12:16] It's got to be more than that. It's got
[2:12:19] to bring a manifestation of perfect love
[2:12:22] that will cause us to fall on one
[2:12:24] another's necks and love each other and
[2:12:28] weep because we see each other this time
[2:12:31] and we won't see each other again for
[2:12:33] another time. When brother Brandham was
[2:12:36] explaining that kind of a manifestation
[2:12:38] of perfect love, he was looking for some
[2:12:41] way and he reaches in. Perhaps this is
[2:12:43] pretty carnal, but but I like it. I like
[2:12:46] it very much. He said, "Why you get in
[2:12:48] that atmosphere and make you want to
[2:12:50] chew one another's chewing gum?"
[2:12:55] That's what I said, Brother Jared. First
[2:12:56] time I ever read that, Lord have mercy.
[2:13:00] But if you ever get in that atmosphere,
[2:13:04] in that atmosphere where the word is
[2:13:06] made known, where the glory of God has
[2:13:08] come down onto the mercy seat, in that
[2:13:12] atmosphere, all of your ickies and
[2:13:15] yakies and
[2:13:18] all the things that divide us now are
[2:13:20] gone. That's right. Amen. We're not
[2:13:24] interviewing somebody to see what they
[2:13:26] believe about the seals or what they
[2:13:29] believe about this or what they believe
[2:13:30] about the other. We don't have time to
[2:13:32] worry about the things that divide us.
[2:13:35] We get caught up in the things that make
[2:13:37] us one.
[2:13:40] How do I know the five-fold ministry of
[2:13:42] Ephesians is not finished? Because the
[2:13:45] work that's described, the result of her
[2:13:47] ministry has not yet happened. Till we
[2:13:50] all come. till we all come to the unity
[2:13:53] of the faith. You can't claim you're in
[2:13:55] a bride's revival because you've seen
[2:13:57] some miracles if you can't love and
[2:13:59] fellowship with one another down here.
[2:14:03] Perfect love is more than miracles.
[2:14:06] That's right. Exactly right. We're not
[2:14:08] going to take a rapture without it. And
[2:14:12] we're not going to come to it until we
[2:14:15] die.
[2:14:17] And everybody wants to go to heaven, the
[2:14:19] song said, but very few people want to
[2:14:22] die.
[2:14:24] The preacher began to ask one night in a
[2:14:26] little little uh Bible sort of class, he
[2:14:30] began to ask, "Who wants to go to
[2:14:32] heaven? Who wants to go to heaven? Who
[2:14:34] wants to go to heaven?" And many many
[2:14:36] people, including children, raised her
[2:14:38] hand. But there was one little child
[2:14:40] that didn't raise her hand. And the
[2:14:44] preacher said,
[2:14:45] "Sweetheart, I noticed that of all the
[2:14:47] hands that went up, yours wasn't one of
[2:14:49] them. And don't you want to go to
[2:14:51] heaven?" She said, 'Oh yes, sir. With
[2:14:54] all my heart, I want to go to heaven.
[2:14:55] But I thought you was getting up a bus
[2:14:57] load to go
[2:15:00] tonight. Oh
[2:15:03] my. Well, isn't next week Father's Day?
[2:15:07] That was a dad joke, Finn, I guess, for
[2:15:09] you. But it's really that way. with all
[2:15:12] her heart. She wanted to go to heaven.
[2:15:14] She just wasn't ready to go yet.
[2:15:16] Everybody wants to get there, but but
[2:15:18] very few people want to pay the price.
[2:15:20] The price is death.
[2:15:22] The altar is not the bless me club. The
[2:15:26] altar is where we go to die.
[2:15:31] It's not where we go to live. It's where
[2:15:33] we go to die. Pretty serious business,
[2:15:36] isn't it? We avoid repentance because we
[2:15:38] don't care for how death smells.
[2:15:42] It was only after John became a dead man
[2:15:44] walking abandoned on deserted island of
[2:15:47] Patmas that he heard a voice and turned
[2:15:49] right toward the face of God, Jesus
[2:15:52] Christ. And in Revelation 11:17, "And
[2:15:54] when I saw him, I fell at his feet as
[2:15:56] dead." And he laid his right hand upon
[2:15:58] me, saying unto me, "Fear not, I'm the
[2:15:59] first and the last." It wasn't until he
[2:16:01] fell like a dead man that he could look
[2:16:03] right square into the face of the Lord
[2:16:06] Jesus Christ in his glorified body,
[2:16:09] glorified existence. That's pretty
[2:16:11] powerful, isn't it? He was a chosen
[2:16:13] apostle of the Lord. He'd spent most of
[2:16:15] his ministry leaning his head on the
[2:16:17] chest of the Lord. He had seen the
[2:16:19] miraculous. He had seen the glory. He
[2:16:21] had tasted the cup right from the Lord's
[2:16:24] hands. He had experienced what it feels
[2:16:26] like to have your feet washed by Jesus.
[2:16:30] But he hadn't died yet. Oh, they tried
[2:16:32] to kill him. They boiled him in oil and
[2:16:34] and banished him to the aisle of Patmas,
[2:16:36] but he hadn't died yet. But when he
[2:16:38] realized this is it. It's time for some
[2:16:42] things to go.
[2:16:44] He got in the spirit on the Lord's day.
[2:16:46] He was caught up to see the day and hour
[2:16:48] that you and I are living in. And he
[2:16:51] fell as a dead man. When he began to
[2:16:55] hear this voice, he turned to see the
[2:16:57] voice. And there stood the Lord in the
[2:16:59] midst of the seven golden candlesticks
[2:17:02] which represent the seven churches of
[2:17:04] Asia Minor and the seven church ages of
[2:17:06] all of church history. It's a pretty
[2:17:08] powerful revelation. But he couldn't get
[2:17:10] it on his feet.
[2:17:12] He couldn't get it in a dance. He
[2:17:15] couldn't get it in a hotty spirit. He
[2:17:18] had to be like a dead man. He had to
[2:17:19] fall and humble himself. I tell you,
[2:17:21] some of us need some carpet time.
[2:17:28] Maybe we understand some mysteries, but
[2:17:30] we need some We need some Jesus time. We
[2:17:34] need some time in the presence of the
[2:17:36] Lord. We need the atmosphere that that
[2:17:39] that welcomes the glory.
[2:17:42] The glory of God doesn't just come down
[2:17:45] in and on anything. It comes down in an
[2:17:48] atmosphere that has been carefully
[2:17:50] prepared to receive the presence of the
[2:17:53] King of Glory. Hallelujah.
[2:17:56] You can be preaching the right thing and
[2:17:57] the glory won't come.
[2:18:00] You can be singing the right song and
[2:18:02] the glory won't come. But without the
[2:18:04] fullness of the glory of God, we're just
[2:18:06] going through the motions.
[2:18:09] We need the fire of God. And fire
[2:18:11] doesn't fall on empty altars. There has
[2:18:14] to be a sacrifice laying up there. Dead
[2:18:17] to self, but a living sacrifice as unto
[2:18:20] the Lord. When that fire began to fall
[2:18:23] in the first great awakening, John
[2:18:25] Wesley gave this testimony. They said to
[2:18:27] him, "How are you getting such big
[2:18:30] crowds to come and hear you preach?" He
[2:18:33] said, "Oh, that's easy. I set myself on
[2:18:36] fire and the people come to watch me
[2:18:38] burn."
[2:18:40] He didn't mean with matches. Come on
[2:18:42] now. He didn't mean with a campfire.
[2:18:46] He meant I consecrate. I dedicate my
[2:18:49] life unto the Lord so that the glory of
[2:18:52] God will fall on the altar. Anybody
[2:18:56] hearing me tonight?
[2:18:58] Not a feeling, not an emotional,
[2:19:03] not some physical
[2:19:05] manifestation, a transforming change
[2:19:09] that you walk out of it fully identified
[2:19:11] with Christ, the word and you know who
[2:19:14] you are. You don't have to keep doubting
[2:19:17] it. Is anybody here? Who knows who
[2:19:20] George Fox
[2:19:22] was? George Fox was sort of a Puritan
[2:19:26] preacher. He's the co-founder of the
[2:19:28] Society of Friends. Do you know the
[2:19:30] other name for the Society of Friends?
[2:19:32] They were called
[2:19:34] Quakers. Because when the spirit of the
[2:19:36] Lord would fall upon them and protracted
[2:19:38] prayer meetings, it is it is noted that
[2:19:41] some would begin to tremble in the
[2:19:44] presence of the
[2:19:46] Lord. And so they called them quakers
[2:19:48] and they went to watch them quake.
[2:19:53] Wouldn't hurt
[2:19:54] you. It wouldn't hurt me if the spirit
[2:19:58] of the Lord would fall on us tonight and
[2:20:00] and we get just a little bit out of our
[2:20:02] comfort zone. Maybe maybe one little
[2:20:06] tiny tear come come sliding down our It
[2:20:09] won't hurt you.
[2:20:11] Maybe you tap your foot a little louder.
[2:20:12] Won't hurt you.
[2:20:14] Somebody said to me, "Well, we don't do
[2:20:16] that in my church." Aren't you glad
[2:20:17] tonight you're not in your church? You
[2:20:18] can just let God have his way. Nobody's
[2:20:21] going to tell. I'm not going to call
[2:20:22] your preacher. Don't know his name. Not
[2:20:24] going to call and tell on you. But
[2:20:25] wouldn't it be wonderful? Not if you did
[2:20:27] it because somebody else was doing it,
[2:20:29] but wouldn't it be wonderful if the very
[2:20:32] manifest presence of God would fall
[2:20:34] around this altar transforming
[2:20:36] somebody's life? There there there are
[2:20:39] people here, I know young people here
[2:20:40] full of anger and rightly so. Would you
[2:20:43] would you criticize me if I said
[2:20:47] that sometimes life can be so bitter
[2:20:51] and so ugly that a little anger is
[2:20:53] almost
[2:20:54] justifiable. The problem is you can't go
[2:20:57] in.
[2:20:59] Even if it's justifiable anger, you
[2:21:02] can't go in with that hanging on your
[2:21:05] life. You got to die out here so that
[2:21:08] you can go in there.
[2:21:12] The garden that was meant to bless and
[2:21:14] keep them here. Here they're driven out
[2:21:17] and a chariot beam with a flaming sword
[2:21:19] turning in all directions is set over
[2:21:22] there at the entry of the garden
[2:21:24] guarding the way
[2:21:27] to the tree of life. And now we're
[2:21:29] turning this thing around and God has
[2:21:31] sent a flaming sword. The revelation of
[2:21:34] Jesus Christ message. It has come from
[2:21:37] God above. And the sword that has once
[2:21:40] kept us out is now driving us back in.
[2:21:44] Back in where? Not just a garden of
[2:21:47] Eden, but into the
[2:21:50] fullness. What? What was manifested in a
[2:21:53] measure in the Holy of Holies? How long
[2:21:56] has it been since you had this thought?
[2:21:58] I don't have all that I that I would
[2:22:00] like to have. There's something pulling
[2:22:02] me for a little bit more of an
[2:22:05] experience with God. Anybody had that?
[2:22:08] Anybody had that? Anybody reading the
[2:22:10] Bible and you just say, "Oh Lord, I want
[2:22:13] that to live a little little louder in
[2:22:15] my life. I want that to grip me a little
[2:22:17] little stronger than it is." Are you
[2:22:19] still here? Still daylight. No, I'm
[2:22:23] moving on.
[2:22:25] Oh, God. I'm not talking about just fe
[2:22:28] Oh, please. Have I said that enough,
[2:22:30] brother Gley? Have I said enough that
[2:22:32] it's not about I'm not talking about
[2:22:33] Let's get everybody to a feeling. Have I
[2:22:36] said it enough? Do I need to keep saying
[2:22:38] it? That's not my theme. I don't even
[2:22:41] care whether we feel anything or not. Uh
[2:22:43] we know there's a mystery in receiving
[2:22:45] the fullness of the Holy Ghost without
[2:22:47] sensation. And that seal of the Holy
[2:22:50] Ghost is only going to fall on those
[2:22:52] according to scripture who have the
[2:22:54] requirements.
[2:22:56] And the requirement is the life.
[2:22:59] It's the life. It's his life. You can
[2:23:02] have the uniform and not have the life.
[2:23:05] You can dress right and not have the
[2:23:08] life. You can read King James version
[2:23:10] and not have the life.
[2:23:14] You can consider yourself a
[2:23:15] fundamentalist or a dispensationalist
[2:23:17] and not have the life. You can call
[2:23:20] yourself a message follower or believer
[2:23:23] and not have the
[2:23:25] life. Without the life of Jesus Christ,
[2:23:30] we are no different
[2:23:32] than any of the other churches that we
[2:23:34] so quickly
[2:23:37] can criticize
[2:23:39] because a form of religion is no
[2:23:42] different over here than it is over
[2:23:44] there.
[2:23:49] George Fox, I think I have this quote.
[2:23:51] Is that my baby girl there? I think I
[2:23:54] have this quote from George Fox, the
[2:23:56] founder of the Society of Friends. I
[2:23:58] wanted to share this with you this
[2:23:59] evening. Been wanting to share it for a
[2:24:00] long time. He said, 'I knew
[2:24:03] Jesus and he was precious to my
[2:24:07] soul, but I found something within.'
[2:24:10] He's talking about his own conversion. I
[2:24:13] knew Jesus and he was precious to my
[2:24:15] soul, but I found something within that
[2:24:17] would not be sweet and patient.
[2:24:25] and
[2:24:30] kind. I I I'm just going to take a
[2:24:33] little sip of water like a
[2:24:34] camel and give you a moment to see.
[2:24:46] I met
[2:24:48] him and he was precious to my soul. But
[2:24:52] I found something within that would not
[2:24:53] be
[2:25:01] sweet and
[2:25:08] patient and
[2:25:11] kind something something
[2:25:14] within. I did what I could do to keep it
[2:25:17] down, but it was
[2:25:22] there. I besought
[2:25:25] Jesus to do something for me. He wanted
[2:25:29] Jesus to do something about his
[2:25:30] something.
[2:25:34] And when I gave him my
[2:25:41] will, somebody has to hear this tonight.
[2:25:45] When I gave him my
[2:25:48] will, he came in.
[2:25:51] Are you trying to tell me George Fox
[2:25:53] wasn't already converted? No. He was
[2:25:55] converted. He had repented.
[2:25:58] He knew Christ. He knew the preciousness
[2:26:02] of having Jesus in his inner man. But
[2:26:05] there was also something else. Before
[2:26:06] you criticize George Fox, the Apostle
[2:26:09] Paul, the first church age messenger,
[2:26:11] had the same issue.
[2:26:14] When I sought to do good, evil was
[2:26:16] present.
[2:26:18] There was also something in the Apostle
[2:26:20] Paul that kept creeping up that was
[2:26:23] keeping him from being, let's just use
[2:26:26] this example, sweet, patient, and kind.
[2:26:29] I besought Jesus to do something for me,
[2:26:31] and when I gave him my will, he came in
[2:26:35] and he took out all that would not be
[2:26:39] sweet and patient.
[2:26:43] Somebody said, "I'm a man." I know. So
[2:26:45] was George Fox.
[2:26:49] He took out all that would not be sweet
[2:26:51] and patient and kind. And look at what
[2:26:53] he did then.
[2:26:58] Would you be willing to let him pass the
[2:27:01] entryway? Would you be willing to let
[2:27:03] him continue on in past the door?
[2:27:08] Would you be willing to let him take a
[2:27:10] little stroll through your life and put
[2:27:14] his finger on the part of
[2:27:16] you as he did George Fox that was not
[2:27:19] sweet, that was not patient, that was
[2:27:22] not kind? No one is asking you to be a
[2:27:24] pushover.
[2:27:26] No one is asking you to be uh you know
[2:27:29] some some uh um I don't even know what
[2:27:33] I don't even know what to use.
[2:27:37] No one is asking you to be sappy or
[2:27:40] syrupy or
[2:27:43] phony. The one thing I can't stand is
[2:27:45] false humility.
[2:27:48] Someone pretending to be I'm so
[2:27:51] humble. I'm not talking about being
[2:27:54] passive as a man or a woman. I'm talking
[2:27:57] about letting God deal with that
[2:28:00] something something.
[2:28:02] Lord, I need you to do something that
[2:28:04] can deal with my something.
[2:28:08] Anybody hear me? He knew Jesus there was
[2:28:12] still something within which was
[2:28:13] antagonistic to the spiritual life that
[2:28:16] had been implanted in him. Nor nor was
[2:28:19] his this experience it was not peculiar
[2:28:21] to him alone. He realized that. He
[2:28:24] realized that there were many people,
[2:28:26] including newborn Christians, but also
[2:28:29] even those who had followed the Lord for
[2:28:31] some time, who were still dealing
[2:28:34] with something.
[2:28:39] The Bible name for that is the carnal
[2:28:40] mind.
[2:28:43] Romans 8:67, for to be carnally minded
[2:28:45] is death, to be spiritually minded is
[2:28:47] life and peace. Because the carnal mind
[2:28:49] is what?
[2:28:52] For it is not subject to the law of God,
[2:28:54] neither indeed what
[2:28:58] a carnal
[2:29:01] mind. Sometimes it's called flesh.
[2:29:04] Romans 8:89. So then they that are in
[2:29:07] the flesh cannot please God, but ye are
[2:29:09] not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if
[2:29:12] so be that the spirit of God dwell in
[2:29:13] you. Now if any man have not the spirit
[2:29:15] of Christ,
[2:29:19] Paul said in 1 Corinthians 3 1-3, I
[2:29:22] brethren could not speak unto you as un
[2:29:24] spiritual, but as under carnal, even as
[2:29:26] under babes in Christ, I have fed you
[2:29:28] with milk and not with meat. For
[2:29:29] hitherto you were not able to bear it,
[2:29:31] neither yet now are able, for ye are yet
[2:29:34] carnal. For whereas there is among you,
[2:29:37] you want to understand what a carnal
[2:29:39] mind looks like in a church house. Among
[2:29:42] you there is yet envying and and strife.
[2:29:46] Envying is comparing.
[2:29:51] Division and ye are you not carnal and
[2:29:55] walk as men.
[2:29:58] You could have eaten some
[2:30:00] meat if you would have just
[2:30:03] gotten that
[2:30:05] something that flesh that carnal nature
[2:30:09] dealt with.
[2:30:11] You see, this carnal mind isn't
[2:30:14] automatically destroyed when we come to
[2:30:16] Christ. It wants to live. It wants to
[2:30:19] thrive. It wants to pull you out of
[2:30:21] God's plan. In a message, the revelation
[2:30:24] of Jesus Christ, brother Brandham said,
[2:30:26] paragraph 118, he said, uh, the carnal
[2:30:29] mind shuns it because the carnal mind
[2:30:32] knows nothing about it. No wonder the
[2:30:34] carnal mind doesn't know it because it's
[2:30:37] Satan in that carnal mind. and Satan is
[2:30:40] exposed. And Satan does not want himself
[2:30:44] exposed. It's the enemy that is
[2:30:47] inspiring carnality in our thoughts.
[2:30:52] It's beyond just a flesh nature.
[2:30:55] To me to be surrendered to the Lord, to
[2:30:57] have met the Lord and the beauty of
[2:30:59] salvation and redemption and still be
[2:31:02] dealing with this carnal mind means that
[2:31:04] the enemy has found a place that he can
[2:31:07] breathe over your thoughts
[2:31:10] and cause you to struggle.
[2:31:13] Maybe we need to cry out like George
[2:31:16] Fox, Lord, I need something from you to
[2:31:19] help me deal with this something. Yeah.
[2:31:24] Galatians
[2:31:26] 5:16-17. Don't have time to read it.
[2:31:28] Galatians 5:24. The news is getting a
[2:31:31] little better. And they that are
[2:31:33] Christs have crucified the flesh with
[2:31:38] the afflictions, affections, and lust.
[2:31:41] It's a willful, intentional act
[2:31:45] to pull some of those things down every
[2:31:48] time they creep up. When envy creeps,
[2:31:51] when jealousy creeps, when bitterness
[2:31:54] creeps, when anger creeps, when your
[2:31:56] temper creeps up,
[2:32:03] it's not just something poured on it. We
[2:32:06] need something that will abolish
[2:32:10] and destroy that carnal mind. The only
[2:32:12] thing I know of is to find and take the
[2:32:14] mind of Christ. We may think that we
[2:32:17] have it, but the reality is we think
[2:32:19] like Christ sometime and think like
[2:32:21] flesh the rest of the time. And the
[2:32:23] scripture classifies us like this, a
[2:32:25] double-minded man. One who thinks like
[2:32:28] Christ part of the time and flesh part
[2:32:30] of the time. He's unstable
[2:32:34] in all of his ways. Somebody said, "Boy,
[2:32:36] this is getting hopeless in here because
[2:32:38] because I I sometimes feel the mind of
[2:32:40] Christ. I sometimes know I'm thinking
[2:32:42] the word. I know the word is winning and
[2:32:44] other times I feel like my carnal mind
[2:32:47] and flesh is winning and and and what
[2:32:50] will I do about it and and will I I'll
[2:32:53] never be able to win this battle. Oh,
[2:32:54] you will. You will. You will. You will.
[2:32:56] It's won. The battle's already won. You
[2:32:59] you you just got to call an end to the
[2:33:01] war, but the the victory is yours. It's
[2:33:05] yours. The way has been made, but you
[2:33:09] won't coast in.
[2:33:11] You won't just flop in.
[2:33:14] You You can get quiet. I I I I won't
[2:33:17] shorten it a bit
[2:33:20] in a message all the days of our life.
[2:33:22] I've gotten to page eight. This is good
[2:33:24] for me. He said, "And they that are
[2:33:26] Christ have crucified." He said in uh
[2:33:30] paragraph 27, "The Holy Spirit speaking
[2:33:32] in the scriptures tonight that that we
[2:33:34] might serve him all the days of our life
[2:33:35] in holiness before him." Cleanliness.
[2:33:38] That's cleanliness and holiness. But
[2:33:40] today you can mention that word holy and
[2:33:42] people laugh at it. See how Satan's got
[2:33:44] it all wrapped up. But he said you are a
[2:33:46] slave and if you're a Christian you're a
[2:33:48] slave. You're a bonds slave of the Lord
[2:33:50] Jesus Christ. Ain't that great? If
[2:33:52] there's two people of you both spirit
[2:33:54] and body and if you cater to the flesh.
[2:33:59] It's real simple. If you cater to the
[2:34:00] flesh if you lean to the flesh you're a
[2:34:03] slave of the devil and you'll crucify.
[2:34:06] That's right. That's right.
[2:34:10] the soul that's in you.
[2:34:14] For the Bible said, "The soul that
[2:34:15] sinners shall surely die." And you have
[2:34:17] to crucify the
[2:34:18] flesh in order to be a bonds slave in
[2:34:21] your flesh to be a servant of Jesus
[2:34:24] Christ. So, you're a slave any way you
[2:34:25] take it and you'll you can't get away
[2:34:28] from that. You're either a slave to sin
[2:34:30] and Satan or you're a bond slave, a love
[2:34:33] slave to the Lord Jesus Christ. What is
[2:34:35] your choice? Amen. But you can't go on
[2:34:38] to have overcoming power in the last
[2:34:40] days. We haven't seen yet what things
[2:34:42] are going to be and how things are going
[2:34:45] to shift and and we don't yet know what
[2:34:47] we're going to face and we're not going
[2:34:49] to be able to overcome them with a hope
[2:34:51] so or a maybe so or with a double-minded
[2:34:54] man mindset. Are you here? Other names
[2:34:58] in the Bible for that something are are
[2:35:00] sin that dwelt in me, the law of sin,
[2:35:02] the body of this death, the sin which
[2:35:04] doth so easily beset, the sin of the
[2:35:06] world, the body of sin, our old man. It
[2:35:09] goes on and on and on. The scriptures
[2:35:11] keeps mentioning this strife, this
[2:35:13] struggle, this war, this inbred sin,
[2:35:16] this depravity, our evil nature,
[2:35:19] original sin, the Adamic nature. It goes
[2:35:21] on and on. But thank God, I want to tell
[2:35:24] you tonight, I want to tell you on the
[2:35:26] way out of this, I want to tell you
[2:35:28] there's power. There's power over the
[2:35:30] flesh. There's power over carnality.
[2:35:32] There's power over the body of sin.
[2:35:35] There's power over the law of sin.
[2:35:37] There's power over inbredad sin. There's
[2:35:39] power over the evil nature, the original
[2:35:42] sin, the Adamic nature. There's power
[2:35:45] over that. And it's in the blood of
[2:35:48] Jesus Christ. His blood, the life that's
[2:35:51] in that blood has the ability to
[2:35:53] eliminate and to destroy that nature.
[2:35:58] Not just once, once and for all.
[2:36:02] [Music]
[2:36:03] But it won't just happen. That's right.
[2:36:05] It doesn't just fall on your head like
[2:36:07] ripe cherish from a tree.
[2:36:10] There is an identification that must
[2:36:12] take place. You must choose who to take
[2:36:15] sides with. Not once. As a believer,
[2:36:19] daily. We have to choose daily what what
[2:36:22] dog to feed, what voice to listen to.
[2:36:25] That's right.
[2:36:27] Daily.
[2:36:31] Romans 6:6. Look at it. Knowing this
[2:36:33] that our old man, our old man, our old
[2:36:37] man. Anybody had an old man? It's
[2:36:41] crucified with him. Then what is that?
[2:36:43] Something
[2:36:47] something. What are we letting
[2:36:50] in? Knowing this, that our old man is
[2:36:52] crucified with him that the body of sin
[2:36:54] might be destroyed, that henceforth we
[2:36:56] should not serve sin.
[2:36:59] Romans 6:7, for he that is dead is freed
[2:37:01] from sin.
[2:37:03] Dead dead man walking, only dead man can
[2:37:06] see the full glory of God. For he that
[2:37:09] is dead is freed from sin. Now, if we
[2:37:11] are be dead with Christ, we believe that
[2:37:13] we shall also do what? Live with him. Go
[2:37:16] home and read the rest. 9 through16.
[2:37:18] Read it. Read it. Read it. Read it.
[2:37:20] You'll understand that sin doesn't have
[2:37:22] to rule or reign in your mortal body.
[2:37:25] Because if you can find your
[2:37:27] identification in Christ crucified,
[2:37:31] if you can find your identification in
[2:37:33] Christ resurrected,
[2:37:35] if you can know that you know that you
[2:37:37] know that you were in him when he died,
[2:37:42] if you can know that you know that you
[2:37:44] know that you were in him when he
[2:37:46] suffered,
[2:37:48] then you become one who fellowships and
[2:37:52] participates
[2:37:54] in his suffering. Uffing
[2:37:57] the old church taught, you know, you've
[2:38:00] got to suffer every day. You've got to
[2:38:03] keep suffering. You've got to keep
[2:38:05] pulling yourself up and out because
[2:38:08] you've got to learn the fellowship of
[2:38:09] his suffering. You better read that
[2:38:11] verse. You better read that verse again.
[2:38:13] There's going to be trials. Yes, there's
[2:38:15] going to be heartaches. Yes, there's
[2:38:16] going to be suffering. Yes, yours won't
[2:38:18] look like mine, and mine won't look like
[2:38:20] yours. But I want you to know that's not
[2:38:22] how you fellowship with Christ in his
[2:38:24] suffering. You fellowship with Christ in
[2:38:26] his suffering by placing your
[2:38:27] identification in him by knowing that
[2:38:29] you were in him according to the New
[2:38:31] Testament. You were in him when he died.
[2:38:34] You were in him when he was crucified. A
[2:38:37] prophet tells us clearly that as Adam
[2:38:40] received a separation as God reached in
[2:38:42] and pulled the feminist part out of
[2:38:44] Adam, pulled Eve right out of him that
[2:38:47] day at Calvary. Symbolically, the very
[2:38:49] same thing took place. He reached in the
[2:38:51] side of the bridegroom and separated
[2:38:54] from him. Again, symbolically a bride.
[2:38:59] That means I was in him. That's right.
[2:39:03] This is identification.
[2:39:06] We talked about Memorial Day. We we
[2:39:09] talked about that whole quote where he's
[2:39:12] preaching away and he said, "I was with
[2:39:14] Paul Rivere. I was with I was with
[2:39:16] George Washington." when and and you
[2:39:17] hear that as a non-believer and you say,
[2:39:19] "Well, what in the world is that man
[2:39:20] talking about?" But as a believer, he
[2:39:22] said, "I'm an American." And that means
[2:39:24] I'm identified with her in her strengths
[2:39:26] and in her weaknesses. I was there. I
[2:39:30] was in her when she was formed. I am I
[2:39:34] am an American. He was preaching.
[2:39:36] And if you were ever in
[2:39:38] Christ, if you were ever even a thought
[2:39:41] in the mind of God before the foundation
[2:39:43] of the world, then by identification,
[2:39:46] you were in him when he suffered. You
[2:39:48] were in him when he died. You were in
[2:39:51] him when he rose from the dead.
[2:39:55] This becomes a revelation to you.
[2:39:59] And you understand
[2:40:02] then that that something something
[2:40:06] can be dealt with. How many of you know
[2:40:08] there's only one way? I'm uh musicians.
[2:40:11] Let's see how slow you can
[2:40:22] come. Somebody tell me if they're
[2:40:30] running. This is winnable.
[2:40:34] This is doable.
[2:40:36] There's an answer for the something
[2:40:38] something.
[2:40:40] You see, God didn't open up the
[2:40:41] revelation of Jesus Christ through his
[2:40:43] word so that we could experience the
[2:40:46] same kind of daily battles and grinds
[2:40:48] and binds and struggles that others who
[2:40:51] have not yet come to that revelation uh
[2:40:53] experience on a daily basis. Revelation.
[2:40:57] Revelation. When God reveals to you your
[2:41:00] identification in Christ, then you have
[2:41:03] a new weapon.
[2:41:05] Amen. You have a new weapon to use on
[2:41:08] your enemy because he's going to lie to
[2:41:10] you every day. Anybody here? He's going
[2:41:13] to lie to you. Did Did you you believe
[2:41:15] the devil lied to anybody in here today?
[2:41:18] Anybody bold enough to raise your hand
[2:41:19] and say, "Yeah, I heard it. I heard some
[2:41:21] I heard him. I heard him." He did.
[2:41:25] Brother, that's all he is. That's all
[2:41:27] he's ever been. And the only reason why
[2:41:30] he gets in our ear is because he comes
[2:41:32] with a little bit of the truth.
[2:41:35] And we open up the door and let him on
[2:41:37] in. But we must understand that we have
[2:41:41] the weapon, the revelation of the open
[2:41:44] word is a weapon to use against the
[2:41:47] enemy to defeat that something
[2:41:49] something.
[2:41:51] Yes, sir. George Fox didn't have it. You
[2:41:54] can have it. You can see it. God can
[2:41:58] make it known to you.
[2:42:05] Only dead men see God.
[2:42:08] Sin shall not have dominion over you.
[2:42:10] Greatest battle ever
[2:42:13] fought. Paragraph 129. Then if Satan can
[2:42:16] get through there, get by this conscious
[2:42:18] and these other things, he gets right
[2:42:20] down here to the end of the soul in the
[2:42:22] mind, you have to let him in. Then when
[2:42:25] he gets in, he's got
[2:42:28] control. You hear that? Then what does
[2:42:32] he do? He begins to use the conscious.
[2:42:34] He begins to use this outlet. See,
[2:42:37] taste, feel, smell, hear, imaginations,
[2:42:39] conscience, memory, reasons, affections.
[2:42:41] He begins to use all those little
[2:42:43] different channels. As long as he can
[2:42:44] get in above this one here, he's got to
[2:42:48] come in your mind first. And you have to
[2:42:52] accept it.
[2:42:56] You used to not know any better. And so
[2:42:59] you just take whatever he says and you
[2:43:01] deal with it the rest of the day. I'm a
[2:43:04] failure. I've never really been born
[2:43:07] again. I'm the problem with my kids. I'm
[2:43:09] the problem with my neighbor. I'm the
[2:43:12] problem on the job. I'll never live a
[2:43:14] victorious life. I'll never be able to
[2:43:16] overcome my own self, my own carnality,
[2:43:18] my own flesh. You just keep going on and
[2:43:20] stewing and building and rehearsing the
[2:43:23] lie and repeating the lie because you
[2:43:25] accepted the lie. I'm telling you,
[2:43:27] you've got to meet that devil at the
[2:43:29] door. You've got to meet him at the
[2:43:31] door. You've got to say, "Wait just a
[2:43:34] minute, devil.
[2:43:38] I was in him. I was in him. I was in
[2:43:41] him. I was in him. My identity is in
[2:43:45] him. My identity is not with fallen
[2:43:48] Adam, the first Adam. It's with the last
[2:43:51] Adam.
[2:43:52] Some of you sisters ought to say, "My
[2:43:54] identity is not with fallen e fallen
[2:43:57] Eve. My identity is with Mary who said,
[2:44:00] "Be it unto me according to thy word."
[2:44:06] Revelation brings
[2:44:08] identification that helps you to know
[2:44:11] who you are and what your destiny is.
[2:44:14] Your destiny is not to struggle every
[2:44:17] day of your life in your mind. It's the
[2:44:20] greatest battle ever fought, but God has
[2:44:23] provided a way. You've got to choose.
[2:44:25] You have to choose. Don't Haven't
[2:44:27] Haven't you preached this? Oh yes. For
[2:44:30] 20 plus years I have. Why are you doing
[2:44:34] it again? Because God won the wrestling
[2:44:36] match. He won the wrestling match again
[2:44:39] today. And I'm here to remind you that
[2:44:42] you've got everything you need to defeat
[2:44:44] the enemy. It's in you right now. You
[2:44:46] don't need another preacher to bring it
[2:44:48] along. You don't need another experience
[2:44:50] to get it to you. It's there. If you've
[2:44:52] received the revelation of the word, if
[2:44:55] you have surrendered yourself to who he
[2:44:57] is and the fullness of who he is, you
[2:45:00] have what you need to defeat the enemy.
[2:45:02] But nobody can use it for you.
[2:45:07] You can confess to the priest and he can
[2:45:09] help you. There's only one person who
[2:45:12] can take the weapon. There's only one
[2:45:14] person who can choose where you identify
[2:45:16] yourself. Are you going to identify
[2:45:18] yourself as a loser because Satan said
[2:45:20] you are? Or are you going to identify
[2:45:22] yourself in Christ because the
[2:45:24] revelation of the word says that's who
[2:45:26] you are.
[2:45:28] Now, what do we know about Christ?
[2:45:30] According to Hebrews, we know Hebrews
[2:45:32] 7:26, we know that he became us who is
[2:45:35] holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from
[2:45:37] sinners, and made higher than the
[2:45:39] heavens.
[2:45:41] My identification is in him. So my
[2:45:45] reality, my present battle may be that
[2:45:47] I'll never make it. I'll never I'll
[2:45:49] never pick up. I'll never be able to win
[2:45:51] this thing. I'll never be able to be a
[2:45:52] mature son of God. But my reality is I
[2:45:56] was in him when he died. Yes, sir. I was
[2:45:58] with him when he defeated death, hell,
[2:46:00] and the grave by identification.
[2:46:03] Identification is where you put
[2:46:04] yourself.
[2:46:06] It's the flag you fly.
[2:46:10] It's the flag you fly, sir. I'm
[2:46:12] identified. I'm identified. I'm
[2:46:14] identified. Be careful what kind of flag
[2:46:16] you fly
[2:46:23] because that's your identification.
[2:46:28] And if you identify with the struggle
[2:46:30] and you listen to the lie, you'll be
[2:46:33] caught up in that something something.
[2:46:39] You You'll be beating yourself every day
[2:46:41] of your life. And I tell you what, if
[2:46:43] that's the way it has to be, I don't
[2:46:45] understand why Christ had to suffer the
[2:46:47] way that he suffered.
[2:46:49] If I have to earn this salvation and
[2:46:51] this victory and this overcoming power,
[2:46:53] if I have to earn this for myself, I
[2:46:55] don't know why my Lord had to suffer the
[2:46:57] way he had to suffer.
[2:47:01] If I have to keep experiencing this
[2:47:03] great battle of the mind and there's no
[2:47:05] hope for me and no way out until the
[2:47:07] rapture, then I don't understand why my
[2:47:10] Lord had to suffer the way he did. The
[2:47:12] reality is the lie can only get in if
[2:47:14] you let it in. You got to let him. And
[2:47:16] then when he gets in, he'll take
[2:47:18] control. When Satan walked up to Eve and
[2:47:20] said, "You know the fruit is pleasant."
[2:47:22] She stopped for a moment. Oh, that's
[2:47:23] when she made a mistake. She stopped for
[2:47:26] a moment.
[2:47:30] I know we got to go. When the enemy
[2:47:33] tells you you're never going to make
[2:47:34] this thing, you'll you'll never be
[2:47:35] bride. The way I hear some preaching
[2:47:38] preaching bride, preachers preaching
[2:47:39] bride, it's as though you have to find
[2:47:41] some place to
[2:47:43] qualify. Well, I want you to know
[2:47:45] something. I could never be worthy in
[2:47:47] myself, in my rotten way. I could never
[2:47:49] be worthy to be his wife. I could never
[2:47:52] be worthy to wear the name Mrs. Jesus
[2:47:54] Christ. But the reality is I'm only
[2:47:56] worthy because he made me thus. He made
[2:47:59] me worthy. How did he do that? By
[2:48:01] letting me come in to his
[2:48:03] identification. By letting me be
[2:48:05] accepted in the beloved. Isn't that what
[2:48:07] the New Testament said?
[2:48:10] Glory to God. Does that mean I can just
[2:48:12] sin and go out and whoop and party and
[2:48:14] carry on, have a good time? That's not
[2:48:16] what it means at all. The more you close
[2:48:19] the door to the lie of the enemy, the
[2:48:22] more you're going to understand your
[2:48:23] destiny is over there behind that veil.
[2:48:30] Once a year, one man could go in. But I
[2:48:34] want you to know when Jesus died, the
[2:48:36] scripture tells us in the gospels that
[2:48:38] when Jesus died on Calvary, the veil of
[2:48:40] the temple was
[2:48:42] torn in twain from what? And the way was
[2:48:46] made. God doing two things. Exposing the
[2:48:50] fallacy of
[2:48:51] religion and opening up the way.
[2:48:56] Most Jews believe the ark of the
[2:48:58] covenant was still behind that veil.
[2:49:01] Most Jews, most worshippers had no idea
[2:49:04] that the ark had been lost and that it
[2:49:07] was not behind that veil. So they just
[2:49:09] kept believing that that priest was
[2:49:12] putting blood on the ark of the
[2:49:13] covenant. The reality is in the time of
[2:49:16] Christ, there was no ark of the covenant
[2:49:18] there, only a foundation stone. And the
[2:49:20] priest would go behind that veil. Nobody
[2:49:22] would know what would happen except the
[2:49:24] priest. And he would sprinkle blood on
[2:49:26] the foundation stone without the mercy
[2:49:28] seat, without the ark because it was
[2:49:30] gone. So when that veil torn from top to
[2:49:32] bottom, I want you to know anybody, any
[2:49:34] priest that was there that hadn't been
[2:49:36] led in on the secret, he looked right in
[2:49:39] and he saw, "Oh my
[2:49:40] goodness, we've been in
[2:49:43] jeopardy. We've been guessing so and
[2:49:45] hoping
[2:49:49] so." I heard brother Brandham say if
[2:49:52] they could have looked right out through
[2:49:53] the window there, they would have seen
[2:49:55] hanging on the cross.
[2:49:59] the
[2:50:00] answer. They didn't need that box
[2:50:03] anymore. There was a new mercy seat.
[2:50:07] There was a new blood. Come on. There
[2:50:09] was a new blood that had been shed.
[2:50:12] He said, uh, don't stop for nothing.
[2:50:14] You've got the message. Jesus lives. God
[2:50:17] is a healer. That's the message. He
[2:50:19] said, don't stop for nothing. No
[2:50:21] reasoning, no nothing. She stopped for a
[2:50:23] moment. That's when Satan walked right
[2:50:25] into that mind. Some of you live this
[2:50:27] every day.
[2:50:30] the same message just a few few places
[2:50:32] down and I'm I'm going to stop. How does
[2:50:35] he get in? Through the mind. This door
[2:50:37] the battlefront standing there. Now when
[2:50:39] you get that battle set in array now the
[2:50:41] devil's sitting right to uh setting
[2:50:44] right to every heart this morning
[2:50:46] sitting this little girl's heart sitting
[2:50:47] at your heart sitting all around. Oh,
[2:50:49] I've seen you try before. I've heard
[2:50:52] that before. Cast him out.
[2:51:01] Don't offer him tea and biscuit.
[2:51:06] Cast that liar out.
[2:51:11] You're talking to me about my
[2:51:13] worthiness. I'm not standing here by my
[2:51:15] worthiness.
[2:51:16] You're talking to me about my track
[2:51:18] record. I'm not here represented by my
[2:51:20] track record. You see, it wasn't the
[2:51:23] perfection of the worshipper that made
[2:51:25] God accept the offering. It was the
[2:51:28] perfection of the offering. I am not
[2:51:32] perfect will never be in flesh
[2:51:35] perfected. But my offering, my lamb, my
[2:51:40] sacrifice, the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:51:44] cries out.
[2:51:47] It cries out.
[2:51:53] Cast him out. Cast him out. What did the
[2:51:56] Bible say here? Casting him out. That's
[2:51:59] right. Casting him out. And then listen
[2:52:03] at what he says. We been
[2:52:11] trained. We forget our training. Play
[2:52:13] something, please. We forget our
[2:52:17] training. We listen to the lie. This is
[2:52:20] we we took our time tonight because it
[2:52:24] was a battle to get it
[2:52:25] here. Maybe a battle for you to get
[2:52:28] here. Some of you visitors, no doubt you
[2:52:33] are like home folk, you're facing stuff.
[2:52:45] If you don't cast him out in the
[2:52:46] morning,
[2:52:48] he'll hang with you all day long. If you
[2:52:51] don't shut the lie down, I'm not even
[2:52:53] going to look around. I don't want to
[2:52:54] see I don't want to see the rush on your
[2:52:57] face.
[2:53:03] If you don't shut him down in the
[2:53:04] morning, he'll hang he'll hang to lunch.
[2:53:10] Everything you think about yourself,
[2:53:14] if you just stop to think about what
[2:53:16] you're thinking about,
[2:53:19] if you just grab a hold of your stinking
[2:53:21] thinking and say, "Wait a minute.
[2:53:23] There's a price that's been paid."
[2:53:25] That's right.
[2:53:30] Some of you precious little sisters, I I
[2:53:32] I I just feel like I could never be the
[2:53:35] wife.
[2:53:38] That's a lie. That's the enemy telling
[2:53:40] you that
[2:53:43] on my wife's worst
[2:53:46] day, she's been more than I've ever
[2:53:49] deserved.
[2:53:52] If you let the enemy tell you what a
[2:53:55] horrible mother you are or what a
[2:53:57] horrible mother you'll be, if you let
[2:53:59] him tell you that in the morning, he'll
[2:54:01] be telling you that on the bed at night.
[2:54:03] Sure. That's the
[2:54:05] truth. If you let him tell you in the
[2:54:07] morning your family would be better off
[2:54:09] without you. He'll be telling you that
[2:54:10] all through the afternoon.
[2:54:15] The word says something different.
[2:54:19] Jesus our Lord tempted in all manner
[2:54:22] even as we are. I I didn't get to it but
[2:54:24] I will sometime. That that amazing verse
[2:54:27] of scripture in the Gospels that says he
[2:54:29] sanctified himself.
[2:54:32] Jesus sanctified
[2:54:35] himself. When brother Brandham's
[2:54:38] preaching that text, he said, "Well, he
[2:54:39] could have been married. He could have
[2:54:40] had a home. He could have had fancy
[2:54:42] clothes. He he could have had a lot of
[2:54:44] things, but he chose to sanctify
[2:54:46] himself, to put himself apart because he
[2:54:49] had a a a mission, a commission. He had
[2:54:52] something to accomplish. But what sticks
[2:54:54] out to my mind when I read that verse of
[2:54:56] scripture is if Jesus had to remember to
[2:55:00] keep pulling
[2:55:02] himself separate, set
[2:55:05] apart, not to get caught up in
[2:55:08] everything that goes on around you.
[2:55:12] Did you know that President Trump and
[2:55:14] Elon Musk are
[2:55:15] fighting? Did you know I don't care? Did
[2:55:19] you know I could care less?
[2:55:23] I can't get caught up in
[2:55:25] that. I I can't get caught up in what
[2:55:27] this one's saying and that one's saying
[2:55:29] and the others say. I can't get caught
[2:55:31] up in what the enemy is trying to tell
[2:55:33] me about my own life and success. I have
[2:55:36] a decision that I've got to make and
[2:55:38] I've got to keep I've got to keep making
[2:55:39] the right choice and the right all day
[2:55:41] long and cast him out. Cast him out.
[2:55:44] Cast him out. The the the devil, the one
[2:55:47] you've been talking about, well, he
[2:55:49] doesn't exist anymore.
[2:55:51] Yes, sir. That was the old man.
[2:55:55] Do you understand that most of the lies
[2:55:57] he tells you is about the old you? Yes,
[2:56:00] sir. And you are not that you anyway.
[2:56:02] Old things have passed away. Behold,
[2:56:06] all things have become new. All he can
[2:56:10] do is harass you for what you used to be
[2:56:12] and try to convince you that you still
[2:56:14] are. But the blood of Jesus is crying
[2:56:16] out.
[2:56:18] There are no perfect mothers. There are
[2:56:20] no perfect fathers. There are no perfect
[2:56:22] husbands. There are no perfect wives.
[2:56:24] But there's a perfect savior.
[2:56:27] There's a perfect lamb.
[2:56:30] His grace is sufficient. His blood is
[2:56:32] powerful enough. And even our Lord who
[2:56:34] had to sanctify himself, who was tempted
[2:56:36] in all manner as we are, he had to use
[2:56:39] this weapon. He didn't use his his
[2:56:41] position or his
[2:56:43] office. He chose to use the word. It is
[2:56:48] written. It is written. It is written.
[2:56:54] The word. The word. God uses his word to
[2:56:57] defeat his enemy. Isn't that right?
[2:57:01] So the next time, oh, will there be a
[2:57:04] next time before you get in the parking
[2:57:06] lot?
[2:57:08] Somebody will will will not have a
[2:57:10] chance to shake your hand. And before
[2:57:12] you get in the parking lot, some of you,
[2:57:14] not all of you, but some of you will be
[2:57:15] convinced that they're all plotting
[2:57:18] against
[2:57:18] you. You're going to be faced with that.
[2:57:22] Well, I would go down there to eat, but
[2:57:24] everybody's going to look at me like I I
[2:57:25] don't I don't need anything to eat.
[2:57:30] [Music]
[2:57:31] That' be a lie. The food wouldn't be
[2:57:34] down there if I didn't want you to come
[2:57:35] and eat it.
[2:57:37] Oh, people don't believe. Yes, they do.
[2:57:40] I have people say things to me like
[2:57:44] that. Well, you looked at me when you
[2:57:46] said that. That's why I try not to look
[2:57:48] at
[2:57:49] anybody. Not because I'm embarrassed to
[2:57:52] look at you in the eye. I'd like to
[2:57:54] sometime to see if you're
[2:57:56] squirming. But I don't want you to think
[2:57:58] I'm directing it at you individually. I
[2:58:00] am directing at you corporately. I'm
[2:58:03] tired of seeing you beat up and and drug
[2:58:06] around.
[2:58:08] My little buddy, Brother Billy Andrews,
[2:58:10] used to say, "Are you sick and tired of
[2:58:11] being sick and tired?" Yes, sir. Aren't
[2:58:14] you ready to let Jesus win and settle
[2:58:16] this thing in your mind? If you're here
[2:58:19] right now and you would say, "I need to
[2:58:24] realize that I am dead because I died in
[2:58:29] him."
[2:58:31] That little something something that
[2:58:33] keeps rising up in me is a lie. Yes,
[2:58:37] sir. It's not a nature
[2:58:40] because I had a nature change. How many
[2:58:42] of you had a nature change at
[2:58:44] conversion? Yes, sir.
[2:58:47] You You can't be an eagle and a pig at
[2:58:49] the same time.
[2:58:52] You've had a nature change. Sure,
[2:58:54] there's a carnal mind. Sure, there's
[2:58:56] flesh that tries to rise up. But the
[2:58:58] reality is that's in the minority.
[2:59:01] The identification you have in Christ is
[2:59:03] in the majority. And you need to
[2:59:05] fellowship with the majority of what you
[2:59:07] who you are. Yes, sir. And not the
[2:59:09] minority. It's written. It's written.
[2:59:12] The word said. The word said. The word
[2:59:14] said. I died in Christ. I rose with
[2:59:18] Christ. He doesn't lose what he saves.
[2:59:21] The one who started this work in me is
[2:59:23] more than able to finish this work in me
[2:59:26] if I lean on him. He may call me a
[2:59:29] failure, but Jesus says, "I can overcome
[2:59:31] all things because he overcame."
[2:59:36] If you're here and you need God to help
[2:59:39] you with some of these lies that the
[2:59:41] enemy tells, let's see if you're serious
[2:59:43] enough that you'd stand where you are
[2:59:45] right now. This is to the
[2:59:47] believer. This is not to unbeliever.
[2:59:50] This is to the believer. I'm serious
[2:59:53] enough about these lies.
[2:59:57] Maybe you're a preacher or you feel some
[2:59:59] call to you feel some call to be and the
[3:00:01] enemy says you'll never pre you'll never
[3:00:03] be this. You'll never be successful.
[3:00:05] You'll never have an open door. You'll
[3:00:07] never lies lies.
[3:00:11] Lies
[3:00:15] lies. This September I will have been
[3:00:17] ministering 50 years.
[3:00:21] I started at seven, started pastoring at
[3:00:24] 17, and I have never wanted or lacked
[3:00:28] for a place to
[3:00:30] preach. I've never called a
[3:00:33] preacher, never texted or wrote a letter
[3:00:36] and said, "I'm passing
[3:00:37] through. And I've never looked for or
[3:00:43] felt sad because I had to preach for
[3:00:47] you.
[3:00:49] I've turned down more invitations that
[3:00:51] I've taken. And if I never get another
[3:00:53] one, that's okay, too. Because that's
[3:00:56] not what makes me his servant.
[3:01:00] Whom he calls, he qualifies. He doesn't
[3:01:03] He doesn't He doesn't call the
[3:01:05] qualified. He qualifies the called. Come
[3:01:08] on.
[3:01:13] Let him do something in you. I did. I
[3:01:16] asked for everybody to stand, but yet
[3:01:19] you're all standing because you're
[3:01:21] facing the same battle common to man.
[3:01:24] Doesn't matter how much of the Holy
[3:01:26] Ghost you have, you're fighting that
[3:01:27] same battle. You need to choose where
[3:01:30] your identification is going to be.
[3:01:34] Sister Jada, come here.
[3:01:39] Zachary, come to Where is he? Zack, come
[3:01:42] here.
[3:01:45] Where is he? Go get him. I can't see
[3:01:47] him. He's coming. Oh, he's got
[3:01:57] babies. Who else wants to know who you
[3:01:59] are in
[3:02:01] Christ? Anybody else want to come this
[3:02:03] way? I just felt I just felt spontaneous
[3:02:06] to call them, but anyone can come.
[3:02:07] Anybody can
[3:02:11] come. Well, does it work if you force
[3:02:13] people to come? Maybe.
[3:02:16] [Music]
[3:02:18] There's no magic pill to swallow here.
[3:02:20] There's no no formula. It's just Will
[3:02:23] you take God at his
[3:02:25] word? Will you keep listening and
[3:02:28] entertaining and going down those rabbit
[3:02:31] trails of lies? Will you let the enemy
[3:02:33] continue to fill you full of anger or
[3:02:36] envy or whatever it is you're battling
[3:02:38] with? Or will you make a stand tonight?
[3:02:41] I'm done cooperating with the one who's
[3:02:44] out to destroy me. He don't have to
[3:02:47] fight nearly as hard cuz I keep letting
[3:02:49] him in and serving him lunch. Won't you
[3:02:53] make up a m your mind to evict him to
[3:02:56] put him out on his head tonight and say,
[3:03:00] "I am what Christ says I am."
[3:03:05] That's right,
[3:03:07] Lord Jesus.
[3:03:10] Uh, I feel your presence. I'm not here
[3:03:14] because of a feeling. I feel your
[3:03:16] presence. I know you're here. Your word
[3:03:19] is real. Your spirit is present. I ask
[3:03:23] you right now to touch your children,
[3:03:27] your precious ones who have uh come this
[3:03:30] way. It's not required. It's not
[3:03:33] necessary. But many have chosen to stand
[3:03:37] shouldertosh shoulder because this is a
[3:03:40] battle common to man. It's a it's a it's
[3:03:44] a race that is common to man. The enemy
[3:03:47] works against us all in one way or
[3:03:50] another and it all works through the
[3:03:51] battle of the mind. But tonight we want
[3:03:53] to take back Tonight we want to take
[3:03:56] back who you said we are. We want to
[3:03:59] take back the new creature you made us.
[3:04:02] We want to take back, oh God. We want to
[3:04:06] take back who you say we are. We want to
[3:04:09] take back our identity with you, the
[3:04:12] reality that we were with you when you
[3:04:14] were crucified. We want to stand on your
[3:04:17] word tonight and raise up to a higher
[3:04:19] level. Lord, send the transforming
[3:04:22] glory. You you we've heard tonight that
[3:04:25] only dead men see the glory. May May we
[3:04:30] cast ourselves
[3:04:32] on the one who died on our behalf. Yes,
[3:04:36] we die daily. Yes, we we crucify the old
[3:04:40] man. Yes, all of those scriptures are
[3:04:43] right. But our victory is found tonight
[3:04:46] in recognizing that it is not what we do
[3:04:49] for you, but it is what you have done
[3:04:51] for us that makes victory possible.
[3:04:55] Hallelujah. If you feel comfortable,
[3:04:57] just put your hand on someone near you
[3:04:59] right now. I don't want anyone to feel
[3:05:01] uncomfortable, but if you feel
[3:05:03] uncomfortable, put your hand on someone
[3:05:05] right now. I I call lies down in the
[3:05:08] authority of Jesus Christ. I call down
[3:05:11] lies over the people of God, the
[3:05:13] children of God, the redeemed of the
[3:05:15] Lord. I call those lies down in his
[3:05:18] name, by his word through his blood. We
[3:05:21] say to that enemy, you are defeated. You
[3:05:24] are
[3:05:24] exposed. The word of God has uncovered
[3:05:28] you.
[3:05:31] I am what the word says I am. I am what
[3:05:35] the word says I am. I'm a dead man
[3:05:38] because I died in you.
[3:05:41] And I have life because I found life,
[3:05:45] resurrection, anastasis life in you. You
[3:05:48] raised me up. You not only took me to
[3:05:51] the bottom, but you raised me up with a
[3:05:54] with a transforming power. And now,
[3:05:57] Lord, I want more of that experience
[3:05:59] with your glory. I want more of an
[3:06:02] encounter with a revelation that keeps
[3:06:05] driving me back to the reality of who I
[3:06:08] am.
[3:06:14] Jesus.
[3:06:17] Lord, we lay hands on our sister tonight
[3:06:21] in
[3:06:22] faith. And we pray, oh God, that you
[3:06:25] will will remove every arrow, every
[3:06:29] dart, every lie that has found a lodging
[3:06:33] place in her mind and in her heart.
[3:06:37] Every accusation, even that which she
[3:06:40] has accused herself of, even that which
[3:06:42] she has created in her own imagination,
[3:06:47] to sabotage and defeat her own victory.
[3:06:50] We come against that tonight in the
[3:06:52] authority of the blood of Jesus Christ,
[3:06:56] the authority of the living word of God,
[3:07:01] the authority of the
[3:07:07] name. And we command those
[3:07:11] lies, those
[3:07:14] adjectives, those descriptive
[3:07:18] words, we command them to fall to the
[3:07:22] reality of the revelation of what you
[3:07:25] have made
[3:07:27] her. We keep hearing it said, "We are
[3:07:31] not what we ought to be, what we want to
[3:07:33] be, but thank God we're not what we used
[3:07:35] to be. In that we find our faith and we
[3:07:38] find our hope. We find our trust in that
[3:07:41] tonight. Lord, I know what you did. Tell
[3:07:43] him in your heart, sister, I know what
[3:07:45] you've done for me. I know you didn't
[3:07:48] start this thing to leave me now. I know
[3:07:51] that what you started, you will finish.
[3:07:54] You called me your own.
[3:07:58] And I surrender right now.
[3:08:01] I surrender right now as you defeat
[3:08:04] every lie as you pull all of them down.
[3:08:11] Glory to his name. Some of you young
[3:08:13] brothers slip this way and let's lay
[3:08:16] hands on Zach now because this young man
[3:08:19] has had an experience with the Lord
[3:08:22] around the front of this church. And
[3:08:25] from way way before then, I'm sure Satan
[3:08:29] uh made an assignment against him to try
[3:08:33] to redefine who he is and to fill him
[3:08:36] with anger,
[3:08:38] to fill him with
[3:08:40] bitterness. But he is the Lord's. He
[3:08:42] belongs to the Lord.
[3:08:45] I've seen in him the most tender,
[3:08:49] precious nature. I've seen in him the
[3:08:52] most sincere heart. None of the things
[3:08:56] that the enemy has tried to make him
[3:08:59] none of the things the enemy has tried
[3:09:02] to mold remold him or reshape him. What
[3:09:05] I saw was the direct opposite of all of
[3:09:08] those things. And we know that's who he
[3:09:10] really is. His identity is not found in
[3:09:14] bad behavior. His identity is not found
[3:09:17] in words spoken over his life. His
[3:09:21] identity is not found in manifested
[3:09:24] anger
[3:09:26] or
[3:09:27] violence. His identity is found in the
[3:09:30] word of the Lord the seed that he has
[3:09:36] carried. Tonight I pray in the name of
[3:09:40] Jesus that you will rewire
[3:09:44] Lord his his thinking Lord
[3:09:48] in the name of Jesus. May he find a
[3:09:52] redefinition
[3:09:55] of who he is.
[3:10:04] Now, you're going to have to let the
[3:10:05] forgiveness of the Lord just rush over
[3:10:07] you. I'm not asking you to do anything
[3:10:10] except to say yes. All I'm asking you to
[3:10:13] do is just let him in.
[3:10:16] You'd be you you you'd really be an odd
[3:10:19] bird if you if you didn't want him in. I
[3:10:22] think you want him in. So, just open the
[3:10:24] door right now and let him in.
[3:10:28] Uh yesterday ended,
[3:10:32] last night
[3:10:34] You'll never be again.
[3:10:36] You're in another day
[3:10:40] in the name of Jesus. Whoa.
[3:10:45] [Music]
[3:10:50] Every shackle, every
[3:10:53] fatter, every
[3:10:55] chain, we pull it down in the authority
[3:11:00] of Jesus Christ.
[3:11:03] Lord, I receive your forgiveness
[3:11:06] and I thank you for the grace that I
[3:11:09] would just be able to forgive my own
[3:11:11] self.
[3:11:18] May I find the grace of God to let go of
[3:11:21] any grudge.
[3:11:25] Young man, no one is denying you the
[3:11:28] right to feel how you have felt or think
[3:11:33] how you have thought. But what we are
[3:11:35] saying is there's no overcoming power in
[3:11:37] any of that. The only overcoming power
[3:11:40] is to yield your will.
[3:11:44] When I gave him my will, did you
[3:11:45] remember? Did you hear what George Fox
[3:11:47] said? When I when I when I yielded my
[3:11:50] will
[3:11:52] and I let the Lord come. Hallelujah.
[3:11:56] Hallelujah.
[3:11:58] Yes. Hallelujah. I surrender.
[3:12:04] Let us surrender.
[3:12:06] Amen. Now, if you can, I want you to
[3:12:08] begin to say, "Thank you, Lord." Thank
[3:12:11] you, Lord.
[3:12:13] Lord, that's it. That's right. with with
[3:12:18] a grateful heart. Lord, we thank you
[3:12:23] that you allow Uturns,
[3:12:26] fresh starts,
[3:12:28] new beginnings.
[3:12:32] Oh,
[3:12:33] [Music]
[3:12:35] we stand on the promise of your word
[3:12:38] tonight. Hallelujah.
[3:12:41] We stand on the promise of your word
[3:12:45] tonight, Jesus.
[3:12:53] [Music]
[3:12:59] Will you let him do it?
[3:13:04] Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory.
[3:13:08] Hallelujah. Lay your hand on him,
[3:13:10] brother again. Lord, in the name of
[3:13:12] Jesus. In the name of Jesus.
[3:13:19] Shandoresus.
[3:13:32] Glory with the Holy Ghost.
[3:13:35] Glory.
[3:13:41] Come and worship.
[3:13:43] Glory. Leave me a clean heart. Yes,
[3:13:46] Lord. Restore the joy. Yes. In your
[3:13:51] presence.
[3:13:53] [Music]
[3:13:55] That's where I belong.
[3:13:58] In your
[3:14:02] presence, oh Lord my God, in your
[3:14:07] presence,
[3:14:11] that's where I am strong. Oh Jesus,
[3:14:16] seeking your face,
[3:14:20] touching your grace.
[3:14:23] Grant it Lord tonight in the cliff of
[3:14:27] the rock. Let the victory be ours
[3:14:32] in your
[3:14:34] presence. Oh God, just stretch your
[3:14:37] surrender to him right now. In your
[3:14:39] presence,
[3:14:42] I surrender. That's where I belong. I
[3:14:46] surrender your prayer. I surrender my
[3:14:49] will. Oh Lord my God, here in your
[3:14:57] presence, oh that's where I am strong.
[3:15:02] Oh, I'm seeking your face. Touching your
[3:15:06] grace and touching your grace. I stand
[3:15:11] in that place in
[3:15:13] the
[3:15:19] rock. In your presence, oh God, push in
[3:15:23] one more time before we leave. In your
[3:15:29] presence, that's where I
[3:15:32] belong. In your pres. I just won't agree
[3:15:37] with that anymore. Oh Lord my
[3:15:41] God with his
[3:15:45] life and that's where I am strong when
[3:15:50] I'm seeking your face
[3:15:54] and touching your grace. Why don't you
[3:15:57] let the Lord do something for you right
[3:15:59] now wherever you are of the rock? If
[3:16:04] you're still streaming this service,
[3:16:07] make up your mind. In your presence, I'm
[3:16:10] a dead man walking.
[3:16:12] My identity
[3:16:15] was in his death,
[3:16:17] but also in his resurrection.
[3:16:21] The life that I now live is not my own,
[3:16:25] but it's rather the life of Christ. Lord
[3:16:28] my God in your
[3:16:33] presence. Oh that's where I greater is
[3:16:36] he that is in me when I'm seeking your
[3:16:41] face.
[3:16:43] and touching your grace. Little children
[3:16:48] over the clft of the rock even as I

[3:17:00] now. Let him finish his word. your
[3:17:03] praise.

[3:17:13] fill me with the new Lord my God. Push
[3:17:17] out all the presence.
[3:17:22] Fill me. That's where I am strong. When
[3:17:27] I'm seeking your face and I'm touching
[3:17:32] your grace, Jesus,
[3:17:36] in the clift of the rock,
[3:17:40] Lord, you are the restorer
[3:17:43] of in your presence.
[3:17:47] You've taught us how to hope against
[3:17:50] hope. Real reason concrete reason to
[3:17:53] hope. You taught us how to hope. Anyway,
[3:17:56] that's where I I want you to stir that
[3:17:58] up in my little
[3:18:00] sister. Lord, Lord, as she begins to
[3:18:03] just let you, my God, in your pray,
[3:18:09] may she find grace. That's right. And
[3:18:12] that's where may she find grace to just
[3:18:15] let you seek your give her a new
[3:18:21] beginning to a new place of faith
[3:18:25] in the Lord. Teach her.
[3:18:28] Teach her the power of prayer.
[3:18:32] Let her understand your presence that
[3:18:35] you hear her.
[3:18:37] You see these
[3:18:39] tears. You hear the cry of her heart.
[3:18:43] If there are no words that come out of
[3:18:45] her mouth as we sing tonight, you know
[3:18:48] her need
[3:18:50] and you read her heart when she bows
[3:18:54] before you.
[3:18:56] Raise up those generations
[3:19:01] from her own defeat.
[3:19:04] That will march through the land.
[3:19:12] All of creation is longing.
[3:19:18] None of that is you. None of that is for
[3:19:21] your unveiling of power. None of that is
[3:19:25] who you are.
[3:19:28] We call out the release uny.
[3:19:32] [Music]
[3:19:36] Oh God, let this be the hour. We expose
[3:19:42] the
[3:19:44] glory fall in this
[3:19:49] room and let it go forth from here to
[3:19:56] the nations. He's got a life that's
[3:19:58] worth living
[3:20:00] your rest in this place. In those times
[3:20:05] that that you have wondered
[3:20:09] if life was really worth the living.
[3:20:12] He has a life for you.
[3:20:19] In this room, he has a life for you. Let
[3:20:23] it go forth from here to the nation.
[3:20:29] Break off in the name of
[3:20:33] Jesus in this place.
[3:20:37] Hey Lord, as we gather just to seek your
[3:20:43] face.
[3:20:49] Father of creation.
[3:20:52] Oh, he
[3:20:54] cares. He cares. He cares for your
[3:20:57] sovereign.
[3:21:00] He cares. Michaela cares.
[3:21:03] Raise up a chosen generation.
[3:21:09] Cares all that will march through the
[3:21:15] land. Carter, hold up your hand. He
[3:21:18] cares. All of creation is longing.
[3:21:23] He knows how to break every bit of that
[3:21:25] old for your
[3:21:28] unveiling of power.
[3:21:34] [Music]
[3:21:36] Oh, Jesus.
[3:21:39] We call down that lie. Oh God, let this
[3:21:43] be the hour.
[3:21:47] Let
[3:21:49] me fall in this room. You're his.
[3:21:55] Let it go forth from here. Let it
[3:22:00] rewire nations.
[3:22:02] letting
[3:22:04] your fragrance rest.
[3:22:07] [Music]
[3:22:10] Lord, as we gather just to seek your
[3:22:16] face, Jesus, and let your
[3:22:20] glory fall in this room. That's right.
[3:22:25] That's right. Now, let him let it go
[3:22:28] forth from here. I loose you.
[3:22:31] I loose you from it
[3:22:34] in the authority of Jesus Christ.
[3:22:39] [Music]
[3:22:41] Lord, as we
[3:22:44] gather to seek your show him, show him a
[3:22:49] new life.
[3:22:52] Show him a new way of the nations.

[3:52:41] Won't you praise his name? My God's in
[3:52:46] the house. That means that death has to
[3:52:50] flee. Oh, now there is life where
[3:52:54] someone's dark as it used to
[3:52:58] be. And now there is hope. You see
[3:53:02] there's
[3:53:03] no more doubt. Praise his name.

[3:54:21] sin. Till Jesus touched this heart of
[3:54:24] mine. Oh, and he gave me life
[3:54:28] again. I am just a house of clay. Oh,
[3:54:32] but ever since that blessed day, there's
[3:54:36] a light that shines in me. Oh, for all

[3:55:39] praise his name? Because he's in this
[3:55:44] house. Oh, death has to flee. Oh, now
[3:55:50] there is life where all your darkness
[3:55:54] used to be.

[3:56:01] more now. Somebody praise his name.
[3:56:06] Won't you
[3:56:07] praise his name? Won't you praise his
[3:56:12] name? Oh,
[3:56:14] praise his name cuz he's in the house.
[3:56:20] Oh, death has to
[3:56:24] flee. Now there is not where darkness
[3:56:29] used to be. Oh, now there is

[3:57:51] master
[3:57:53] craftsman. Restore to us, Lord, what
[3:57:56] we've
[3:57:59] lost. Let this church be a church of
[3:58:02] dead men walking.
[3:58:05] Let this ministry be a ministry of dead
[3:58:07] men walking.
[3:58:09] May it have an a farreaching effect.
[3:58:12] Lord, we're not here trying to build
[3:58:14] something. We're just here trying to
[3:58:16] obey you.

[3:58:25] plan. Jesus, you

[4:03:21] moments of fellowship at the bottom of
[4:03:23] the hill. And may we find supernatural
[4:03:27] rest on the beds tonight
[4:03:30] to bring us back together
[4:03:32] tomorrow for the next level of what you
[4:03:35] desire to do among us. Our hearts are
[4:03:38] full tonight for what you've done and we
[4:03:41] don't know it all. But we praise you. We

[4:03:48] praise for you are the one who has

[4:03:55] So Lord, we ask you to bless also the
[4:03:59] food and those who have
[4:04:01] traveled. May they find something.
[4:04:05] It doesn't matter to me whether it's in
[4:04:06] the service or whether it's on the bed
[4:04:08] at night. But Lord, may each one of them
[4:04:11] take something home
[4:04:14] that causes them to be in a higher
[4:04:16] place, in a closer place with your with
[4:04:19] you and with your word. And we'll give
[4:04:22] you glory, honor, and praise. Pour into
[4:04:24] the worship leaders. Pour into the
[4:04:26] musicians. Pour into those who've
[4:04:28] ministered in prayer around the altar
[4:04:30] tonight. And we'll give you glory,
[4:04:32] honor, and praise. For it's in the name
[4:04:34] of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray. And
[4:04:36] the saints said, "Amen." You're
[4:04:38] dismissed to go. Uh please don't do your
[4:04:41] fellowshipping in here. There's a
[4:04:44] vestibule and there's a fellowship hall
[4:04:46] at the bottom of the hill. Would you
[4:04:47] meet us there as you feel dismissed of
[4:04:50] the spirit to go? Would you meet us at
[4:04:52] the bottom? God bless you. Go in his
[4:04:56] peace.
