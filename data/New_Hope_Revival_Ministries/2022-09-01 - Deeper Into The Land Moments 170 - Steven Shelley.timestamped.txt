[0:00] but god wants to lead him further in
[0:03] that experience he wants to give him
[0:06] more
[0:07] of himself
[0:08] [Music]
[0:16] but as they're taking this land
[0:20] god has given it to them piece by piece
[0:23] you remember he said i can't give it to
[0:25] you all at one time
[0:28] because
[0:29] if i give it to you all at one time
[0:32] there's not enough of you to occupy it
[0:34] there's not there's not enough of you to
[0:37] occupy the land and if you don't occupy
[0:41] the land then there are going to be some
[0:43] others that are going to come in and
[0:45] they're going to try to usurp authority
[0:47] on that that you cannot watch over and
[0:50] protect
[0:52] okay so
[0:54] god gives them the land little by little
[0:59] and as he is giving them the land
[1:02] they're conquering one city after
[1:04] another
[1:05] and they're inhabiting the land as god
[1:08] gives them victory
[1:11] now this is the way it is
[1:14] with the people of god
[1:16] we start out with our salvation
[1:19] experience and we know that it's the
[1:22] goodness of god that he would give us
[1:25] eternal life that he would come to us
[1:28] with salvation to be able to call on the
[1:32] name of the lord the bible tells us man
[1:35] that calls on the name of the lord shall
[1:37] be saved this is just simple gospel
[1:41] [Music]
[1:42] whosoever calls on the name of the lord
[1:46] shall be saved
[1:47] but that man hasn't conquered any ground
[1:50] he has done one little thing and that is
[1:52] he's called on the name of the lord now
[1:55] this is the beginnings but god wants to
[1:58] lead him further in that experience he
[2:01] wants to give him more
[2:04] of himself and so he beckons to him and
[2:08] he says
[2:09] repent
[2:10] as you're walking this journey then the
[2:13] holy spirit if if you call on the name
[2:16] of the lord and if there's something in
[2:18] you that you want to walk further with
[2:20] him then he beckons to you repent
[2:23] do a turnaround
[2:25] get rid of all of that that you've
[2:27] carried for so long
[2:30] all of the sin the weights the things
[2:32] that beset you
[2:34] the unbelief
[2:36] i'm still getting rid of my unbelief
[2:39] still working i'm still taking the land
[2:43] by my joshua the holy ghost
[2:46] because he abides in me
[2:49] he's giving me the grace and he's giving
[2:51] me the leadership to be able to conquer
[2:55] the the amalekites and the hittites and
[2:58] the hivites to defeat all of them
[3:01] all of them in my life and it starts out
[3:05] with repentance
[3:07] because what i repent of today
[3:10] is i'm repenting of everything that i
[3:13] can see
[3:15] [Music]
[3:19] there are still things in you and in me
[3:22] that i cannot yet see
[3:26] but there will come a time when the holy
[3:29] spirit will take me deeper into the land
[3:34] and he will beckon to me
[3:36] repent
[3:42] another giant
[3:44] another hittite
[3:46] another amalekite
[3:48] remember
[3:50] little malachites grow up to be big
[3:53] amalekites
