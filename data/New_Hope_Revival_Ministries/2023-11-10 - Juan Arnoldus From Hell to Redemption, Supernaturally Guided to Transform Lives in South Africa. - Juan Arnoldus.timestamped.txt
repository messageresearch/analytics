[0:13] we just got done our camp meeting this
[0:15] past weekend and past week and we had
[0:18] some amazing services and I'm joined

[0:32] part of this program well thank you for
[0:33] agreeing to do this with me um it's I
[0:35] feel like it's an honor thank you um I
[0:38] really want to jump right into it and
[0:39] get to know really get to know you a
[0:41] little bit better and uh hear about some
[0:43] of your background growing up um what it
[0:46] was like growing up in Cape Town and
[0:49] just some of your background yeah I was
[0:51] born on the 17th of September 198 in uh
[0:54] Cape Town South Africa um my mother's
[0:57] family were a very cly family father's
[1:00] family were opposite very
[1:03] ungodly so I was basically raised among
[1:06] them on my father's small with my
[1:08] father's family that was very ungodly
[1:10] like I said and very worldly and so I
[1:13] was introduced um to a more ungodly life
[1:17] than to a Godly life so I basically grew
[1:20] up with a sin life and knew nothing
[1:24] basically about the Sanctified life so
[1:26] to me and uh growing up amongst them
[1:30] uh they were gangsters they had many
[1:33] gangster friends they were very involved
[1:35] in gangsterism so for me life was to
[1:38] party to drink to smoke I basically
[1:41] thought that was life you know to get
[1:43] the best girl to get the best car and
[1:46] the things of life and I thought that
[1:48] was life and um but everybody have a
[1:52] life story you know with brother
[1:53] brandham I believe your life story
[1:56] becomes also your training ground and
[1:59] your background God uses uh to use it
[2:01] one day in your ministry sure like with
[2:04] brother Brandon's life story and my life
[2:06] story was I don't say I'm like a Moses
[2:08] or so but Moses was uh raised um in in
[2:12] Egypt with Egyptian gods uh Egyptian way
[2:15] of lifestyle so that's the same way I
[2:18] was basically also raised because I
[2:20] think God used that or allowed that so
[2:23] that Moses could understand the Egyptian
[2:26] ways and Egyptian gods and the Egyptian
[2:29] uh Styles and we know according to
[2:31] shadows and types Egypt is a type of the
[2:34] world so that's basically how I was
[2:36] raised that's was that was my background
[2:38] and that's why when God spoke to to
[2:40] Moses Moses was like you know do you
[2:42] want me to go to Egypt he understood the
[2:44] background the lifestyle the son of
[2:46] Egypt even the gods of Egypt for sure
[2:48] and he told the people he he told god um
[2:52] the how will the people believe me and
[2:54] what shall I tell the people who are you
[2:56] because there's so many gods in Egypt
[2:58] and these people are so dedicated to
[3:00] their gods and the lifestyle he
[3:01] understood everything basically about
[3:02] Egypt and so the first thing that God
[3:05] revealed to Moses was basically
[3:08] sin he sold him the serpent and Moses
[3:11] wanted to run away and he gave the first
[3:13] revelation that revealed to him was
[3:15] basically the serpent that represent or
[3:17] typed sin so God never revealed to him
[3:20] first the lamb and the blood that only
[3:21] came afterwards so Moses had to
[3:24] understand what sin is and the and the
[3:25] beginning of sin and the original sin
[3:28] that's what God revealed to Moses that's
[3:30] what brother told us that's why Moses
[3:32] wrote the first books so Moses had the
[3:34] complete revelation of the Original Seed
[3:36] original sin and he had the revelation
[3:39] of what happened in the Garden of Eden
[3:41] so the first thing that God revealed to
[3:43] Moses was and to me the same I
[3:45] understood sin I understood the power of
[3:47] sin I understood the attraction of sin
[3:49] even the beauty of sin and that's why
[3:51] every evangelist need to understand that
[3:53] Moses was brother says he basically had
[3:56] a Ministry like brother Brenham or
[3:57] brother Brenham had a Ministry like
[3:59] Moses M so Moses was like a evangelist
[4:01] and a prophet at the same time he had a
[4:03] a prophetic Evangelistic Ministry so
[4:06] Moses um basically had the revelation of
[4:10] sin and so I understood the power of sin
[4:13] the beauty of sin the attraction of sin
[4:15] because bra says the serpent was a
[4:17] beautiful uh creature and bra says even
[4:20] after the curse he never lost his Beauty
[4:23] so that shows you how attractive sin is
[4:26] and how sin attracted even Eve and
[4:28] convinced her and um I like what brother
[4:31] B preach preach a sermon the cruelty of
[4:33] sin so even brother Brenham had the
[4:36] revelation of sin God had to S him and
[4:39] going to the depth of that and showing
[4:40] the cruelty of sin but if you don't
[4:42] understand the attraction of sin if you
[4:44] don't understand the power of sin and
[4:45] that's why I think God allowed me also
[4:47] to be raised in that background to
[4:49] understand the depth of sin and what sin
[4:51] is really about and the beauty and the
[4:53] desires of sin Genesis 3:1 the Bible
[4:56] says and uh the serpent was the more
[4:59] subst subtle than all the other
[5:02] creatures in the field and that word you
[5:04] can break it up he was the more clever
[5:06] he was more clever more cunning more
[5:08] smarter there's even a quote where
[5:10] brother says the seat of the seat of the
[5:11] serpent is twice smarter than the seat
[5:14] of Abram and then the prophet also tells
[5:16] us that the devil has 6,000 years of
[5:20] experience 6,000 years of experience and
[5:23] there's no way we where we can outsmart
[5:25] some yeah for sure but you have to have
[5:27] Revelation it can only come by re ation
[5:30] that's why the greatest battle is in our
[5:31] minds and B say that's a chosen place of
[5:34] battle and so the devil have he have
[5:37] access to your mind even if you're a
[5:38] Christian even if you're uh filled with
[5:41] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you
[5:43] still have access to your mind but the
[5:45] prophet says Revelation goes above above
[5:47] your mind so with six so with 6,000
[5:50] years of experience the devil cannot
[5:51] smart us but when God comes by
[5:54] Revelation and I think that's what God
[5:55] did to Moses he revealed to Moses the
[5:57] power of sin and he sold to mes Moses
[6:00] and and Moses was afraid when when he
[6:02] throw down the rot which I believe he
[6:03] slded him and where did you get the rot
[6:05] from it comes from a tree so he so him
[6:07] sin came by the tree by a serpent and he
[6:11] said take the serpent by the tail which
[6:13] mean there can come an end to sin and
[6:15] they turned again to a rot which means
[6:18] that Don't Preach against people's sin
[6:20] but preach them out of their sins you
[6:22] know because I was a I was deep in sin
[6:24] and when people when I used to see
[6:26] people preach against our son when we
[6:27] would come with our with our beard and
[6:29] walking in the street and people say
[6:31] look at them and look at them shame on
[6:33] them then uh you will never draw them
[6:36] closer to God you make them stubborn for
[6:38] sure they want to show you better and do
[6:39] better but I think God with um B says
[6:43] and that's what God did with Moses he
[6:44] revealed to him the serpent and then
[6:46] afterwards he revealed to him the power
[6:49] of the blood of the lamb and that's
[6:50] basically the background how I I grew up
[6:53] and um so to me life was drinking Smoky
[6:56] party uh who can uh party the most who
[6:59] can drink the most who can smoke the
[7:01] most and I never knew that that's
[7:03] actually death came to find out that
[7:05] what I thought was what was life was
[7:08] actually death yeah because Apostle Paul
[7:10] in uh Philippians 1 120 verse chapter 1:
[7:14] 21 he says these words he says for me to
[7:16] love is Christ so Christ is life life
[7:19] comes from God he's the giver of God
[7:21] he's The Giver of Life even the extender
[7:24] of life and uh who can tell us better
[7:28] about life than God himself because he's
[7:30] the creator of Life how to enjoy life
[7:33] the secrets of Life The Mysteries of
[7:34] life it all comes from God so we thought
[7:37] we know what life is I I always look up
[7:39] to my uncles and they were the best guys
[7:42] they got the best girls they every party
[7:44] they were the best in drinking dancing
[7:46] smoking everything they were the top of
[7:48] the top to me they were Heroes yeah at
[7:50] that time you know but I didn't know
[7:53] that that's actually actually death and
[7:55] John 10:10 says this says so wonderfully
[7:58] he says the thief comes to the Devil
[8:01] comes to steal destroy and to
[8:04] kill but Jesus came to give us life and
[8:07] life abundance so who better can tell us
[8:10] about life than God so to enjoy life and
[8:13] to actually understand life the best
[8:15] thing is to understand Christ and that's
[8:16] why Paul came to that knowledge even
[8:18] Moses came to that knowledge but so for
[8:20] me to live was drinking smoking and
[8:22] parting um up till My Teenage life and
[8:26] then my father was in the military so he
[8:29] uh basically retired and we had to move
[8:31] back to a small town where my mother
[8:33] actually grew up and her family was that
[8:34] side and they were a Godly family yeah
[8:36] so we moved back to that side now so
[8:38] it's from the ungodly family now we're
[8:40] moving to The Godly family and came
[8:42] there and uh I was still going on
[8:43] continuing drinking smoking and all of
[8:45] that and my grandfather was basically
[8:47] the pastor of the Baptist Church he was
[8:50] the leader of the church there and I
[8:52] turned all my cousins to drinking and
[8:55] smoking and and and I was busy with
[8:57] partying and things like that and my
[8:58] grandfather used to rebuke me and say
[9:01] you know that's the most ungodly thing
[9:03] you can do over here we we serve God in
[9:05] Holiness so they will they were strict
[9:07] on Holiness and um so I came one one
[9:11] time me and my girlfriend which is my
[9:12] wife today we came from a party from uh
[9:15] a whole weekend of drinking and partying
[9:18] and we came home on our way home we had
[9:19] a terrible accident my best friend died
[9:21] in the accident uh in that accident I
[9:24] basically went out of my body I went to
[9:25] yell never knew there was a yell saw y
[9:28] experien yell for 5 minutes the smelling
[9:31] and I can tell you it smells exactly
[9:33] like when you drink and smoke all those
[9:36] sin sun goes with a smell and it was so
[9:40] I couldn't even breathe in that area and
[9:43] uh there was a nashing of teeth the
[9:45] gates open and the gates were like um uh
[9:49] uh when the gates open I could my my
[9:51] teeth was nashing you know and I went
[9:53] into this place a dark very dark very
[9:55] dark place and it was I just saw the
[9:57] mountains there were no sun no light
[9:59] just as brother brand explained it but
[10:01] within 5 minutes time I was back in my
[10:02] body so everybody in the in the combi we
[10:05] we driving a Combi went to hospital but
[10:07] I had no mark on my on my face body
[10:09] nothing I didn't go to the hospital so
[10:11] my grandfather came to pick me up but
[10:13] that night I made a promise to my wife
[10:16] which is my girl which was my girlfriend
[10:18] at that time I told her you know I'm
[10:20] finished with wealthy things I'm going
[10:21] to serve god with everything that's
[10:23] within me I will never ever if I want to
[10:26] turn back to the world remind me of this
[10:28] day
[10:29] because I never had driver's license I
[10:31] was supposed to go to jail for mans my
[10:33] best friend died but somehow God just
[10:36] worked it out and I came free of it all
[10:38] and that's how I came to Christ no
[10:40] preacher could preach me in but to go
[10:42] through that accident and go out of my
[10:44] body I know I only after I think 10
[10:47] years or 20 years I've told people about
[10:49] the this experience that I had about the
[10:51] Al and it was very very bad and that
[10:53] basically convinced me to serve God and
[10:56] that's why I gave my life to the Lord so
[10:57] for a few years I just served God in my
[11:00] grandfather's church and then afterwards
[11:01] came to the message of the hour that's
[11:03] amazing um so how long have you known
[11:06] your wife because so y'all have been
[11:07] together for a long time very very long
[11:09] time you know bra says your life goes in
[11:11] cycles of seven it's amazing um I I saw
[11:15] it the first time I was still like I
[11:16] said now and then weekends I would go to
[11:18] my to my to my mother's family and she
[11:20] stayed opposite my my auntie so we were
[11:24] again drinking and partying there but
[11:25] the next morning I didn't sleep you know
[11:26] we were so busy with sin and so busy so
[11:29] uh enthusiasm with with the things of
[11:31] the world and that's why I say you have
[11:34] to serve god with with excitement and
[11:35] with everything that's within you and we
[11:38] were drinking and smoking and I was
[11:39] alone awake and the next morning early
[11:41] in the morning I was sitting outside and
[11:43] she left across my my auntie's house and
[11:45] she stood in the door she couldn't see
[11:47] me I saw her and I'm telling you I was
[11:50] sober I just became sober instantly when
[11:52] I saw and I don't even know God and I
[11:55] said Lord if you give that girl to be my
[11:57] wife I will serve love you one day you
[12:00] know and she was 14 years old I was 14
[12:02] years old only years after that somebody
[12:03] introduced us again I think at the age
[12:06] of 16 17 years old wow my cousin
[12:08] introduced us to each other and from
[12:11] there it was love at first sight for her
[12:13] that was my second experience it was her
[12:15] first experience it was my second
[12:17] experience with her and um like I said
[12:19] um yeah from there we got married 21 we
[12:22] were 21 years old got married and
[12:25] full-time Ministry we went into and we
[12:27] got became 8 28 years old and you can
[12:29] see all the cycles of seven we have five
[12:31] kids um three boys two girls and because
[12:35] we're married young they are teenagers
[12:36] now so we are just one big house full of
[12:41] Youth young people you know so we enjoy
[12:43] our lives with them and it's to serve
[12:44] God is the most important thing is the
[12:46] best thing in the world to do I think so
[12:48] many people miss out you know because um
[12:51] God told Abra Adam the day you eat of
[12:53] that Tre that day you die and they
[12:56] didn't die instantly they was they start
[12:59] dying yeah and that's why says only
[13:02] years after that he said you have to eat
[13:03] the tree of life and to know life is to
[13:06] know Christ and if you don't know Christ
[13:09] you've never you never lived amen you
[13:11] are busy dying so many people are just
[13:14] dying without Christ that's what you are
[13:15] doing you are wasting your time wasting
[13:17] your money wasting your years and to
[13:19] serve him is definitely the most
[13:22] important thing in the world to do and
[13:24] it's and it's worth it to do it yeah so
[13:26] after you came to back after you came to
[13:28] the Lord after that accident and
[13:29] everything when did you first hear about
[13:32] brother Brandon how did you get you know
[13:33] acquainted with that's that's a good
[13:35] question because that also brings in how
[13:38] I um came in contact with your father's
[13:41] Ministry okay um what basically happened
[13:44] was um I didn't even know I had to go to
[13:47] a new job I got a new job a promotion to
[13:49] a new job and um the guy that I worked
[13:51] with was in the message but amazing
[13:54] thing is at the same time my uncle said
[13:56] a worldwind came into his uh uh um
[13:59] working place where he basically worked
[14:02] G he said the worldwind came in there
[14:04] and told him to speak to me about the
[14:06] message of the hour but because my uncle
[14:08] was in the message of the hour and and I
[14:11] think he's he last saw us 10 or 12 years
[14:14] last so what he did is he came and he
[14:17] gave me the books introduce the message
[14:18] of the hour to me I started studying
[14:20] because at that time remember I was in a
[14:21] Baptist Church we love the word of God I
[14:23] used to fast and pray and spend time
[14:25] with the word but only the word and then
[14:27] he showed me the books and I I was
[14:29] reading the books to basically disprove
[14:31] it but the more I wanted to disprove it
[14:34] the more the word of God proved it and
[14:37] um so at the same time he introduced uh
[14:39] the message to me and the guy that I
[14:42] worked with um we were about I was a
[14:45] porter at the hotel that's where I
[14:47] started and we were about 12 Porters and
[14:50] only me and him were serving God so
[14:52] obviously we became best bues but came
[14:55] to find out he was also in the message
[14:56] of the hour and then because there was a
[14:59] transport problem with us going to work
[15:00] I had to stay with my auntie for 2
[15:02] months and was staying and when I stayed
[15:04] at her house I went to church with her
[15:07] and when I went to church with her when
[15:09] I got in the church they were preaching
[15:10] the message of the hour so it was my
[15:12] uncle introducing the message to me at
[15:14] the same time uh my best friend at work
[15:17] was in the message of the hour and at
[15:19] the same time I had to to to to move to
[15:21] my auntie's house because we didn't have
[15:23] transport to go to work and there was a
[15:25] transport problem and she was also in
[15:27] the message of the hour but still I
[15:29] couldn't be convinced because you must
[15:32] understand I my grandfather's Church all
[15:35] the whole family was in that church so
[15:37] to me you know there was no way for me
[15:39] to leave that church so um because I was
[15:42] also preaching that church um normally
[15:45] they don't allow young people to preach
[15:46] it was only the elderly people so how
[15:48] how old would you bed when I started
[15:50] preaching 18 years old so what happened
[15:52] was when I came to church or God sa my
[15:54] life all the elderly Brothers backs
[15:56] slided so there was only young people
[15:58] left so they ask us to start preaching
[16:00] and you can imagine I knew nothing about
[16:03] the word my wife always says you know
[16:06] nothing about the word so when they ask
[16:08] you to preach it looks like you knew you
[16:10] you knew the Bible I said no I didn't
[16:11] know the Bible I didn't knew the Bible I
[16:13] knew nothing about the Bible but um what
[16:16] basically happened what convinced me
[16:18] that this message is the truth is the
[16:20] brother it was my best friend brother
[16:22] Mor delpo handed me a tape of your
[16:25] father it was the prodical son so that
[16:27] night I was fasting and praying and I
[16:29] was listening to the prodical Son and
[16:31] the Way Pastor sh was placing
[16:33] predestination in the prodical son he
[16:35] was never lost he was just a lost son he
[16:39] didn't become a son he was always a son
[16:41] before the foundation of the world so
[16:43] Pastor s put in predestination adoption
[16:46] how the young son represent the Gentiles
[16:48] and the Elder son the Jews I could see
[16:51] the whole message of the hour basically
[16:52] in that one sermon and that convinced me
[16:55] that voice that I heard while I was in
[16:57] this dark room
[16:59] laying it it was like I would hear the
[17:01] voice of God speaking to me directly to
[17:03] me so at that moment basically Pastor
[17:06] s's Ministry convinced me that this
[17:07] message is nothing but the truth wow and
[17:10] um just a few months after that my
[17:12] grandfather passed away look how good
[17:13] God is and then the voice said it's time
[17:15] for you to come out so when I came out I
[17:17] lost all my family now in the small town
[17:21] uh basically everybody knew everybody MH
[17:23] so when I stepped out of my
[17:25] grandfather's turs I basically lost all
[17:27] my tur friends
[17:29] all my family um by coming to the to
[17:32] Christ I lost my father's uh family
[17:35] because they were deep in s and I was
[17:37] now a Christian so I lost them basically
[17:40] and when I came to the message of the
[17:41] hour I lost my um my Christian family so
[17:45] we were all alone and it was a hard time
[17:48] which was stuff we would walk in town
[17:50] past my auntie and past my cousins and
[17:52] they would not greet us because if we
[17:54] leave your father if if we leave our
[17:56] grandfather's thirs and we going to hell
[17:58] that was basically the thing you know
[17:59] how could I leave my grandfather church
[18:01] and this message is nothing but demonic
[18:05] and what we did is we used wisdom we
[18:08] just thought you know just love the life
[18:10] and uh but like I said after I think 20
[18:13] years after 20 years my family is
[18:15] starting to come now that's to the B of
[18:17] the hour but like I said I didn't it
[18:19] wasn't just only the one tape that I uh
[18:21] listened of your father me and brother
[18:23] mon started calling uh the office here
[18:27] like we had no we had nothing and um the
[18:31] sisters that used to work here they they
[18:33] basically sent us the tapes for free and
[18:36] we were just studying and feeding on
[18:37] that and I think it was the same time
[18:39] 2001 2002 uh so it's over 22 years ago
[18:43] yeah and it was always our Dream to come
[18:45] here so after 22 years SC but it
[18:47] possible for us to come here and I'm
[18:49] telling you what a what a blessing what
[18:51] a blessing but like I said we studied
[18:53] those tapes and we've listened to tapes
[18:55] like former letterin uh the uh um even
[18:59] the transition from bride to wife and
[19:01] we've heard all those visions and uh
[19:04] what God basically uh did uh through
[19:07] your father's Ministry it blown our
[19:09] minds you know and it just just
[19:11] literally like brother B says uh draw us
[19:14] closer to Jesus Christ and it was our
[19:17] Dream to meet Pastor s and uh I mean
[19:20] after 22 years I'm the only one that
[19:23] made it till th far but there's so many
[19:24] brothers back there so for me being your
[19:27] an honor and a privilege and I promise
[19:28] them when I come back I will have all
[19:30] the equipment all the material we need
[19:33] uh because there were certain things
[19:34] that we wanted to know about the visions
[19:36] and and the seals that we there was no
[19:39] way that we could get hold of it because
[19:41] we had no money and um my wife reminded
[19:43] me on the way yeah how I used to go to
[19:46] the Internet shop just to listen to One
[19:48] sermon you know because we we didn't
[19:50] have money for internet or anything but
[19:53] after so many years God really blessed
[19:55] us and uh just honored to be here and
[19:57] privileged to be here that's amazing uh
[20:00] I now I know y'all do a lot of um tent
[20:03] meetings and tent services over there
[20:05] tell me a little bit about that some of
[20:07] the services from over there I'm also
[20:09] trying to find out you know my my
[20:10] grandfather's church is more on
[20:12] evangelism okay so they more they mostly
[20:15] went out to preach open air service and
[20:17] things like that but I when I listen to
[20:19] Pastor s's uh Ministry I could also hear
[20:21] that these Ministry was also very in the
[20:23] early early years it was also uh 10 10
[20:26] arrivals and what has happened we have
[20:29] like bra says how do you know that
[20:31] somebody really have the Holy Ghost he
[20:33] just he didn't give a scriptural answer
[20:34] he just gave out of his own uh
[20:36] experience he said when you grown in
[20:38] your soul for Souls that's a sign that
[20:41] you must have the Holy Ghost so we were
[20:43] groaning always we had open airs
[20:45] sometimes that's only me and my wife
[20:46] that that had the open ears sometimes me
[20:48] and my wife my sister and um we started
[20:52] at church very small with four people
[20:54] and um well we always hired tent or
[20:57] rented tent
[20:58] we have Services just to draw the people
[21:00] to the message of the hour but in 20 um
[21:04] 21
[21:05] December the C uh it was coover 2019
[21:09] 2020 it was cover 2021 they had a lot of
[21:13] restrictions and so that December they
[21:15] opened up basically all the uh the gates
[21:18] and everything you could fly to another
[21:20] country and we wanted to have holiday at
[21:22] that time and we said oh we just want to
[21:24] have holiday and then a brother had a
[21:26] dream one of the elders in our church
[21:27] had a dream where brother Brenham
[21:29] appeared to him in a dream and said you
[21:30] have to buy a tent and you have to to
[21:33] just once more go out and get soul safed
[21:37] and uh to give you a few testimonies
[21:39] about that yeah um well we bought a tent
[21:42] and then we took all all of their money
[21:44] all the people everybody in church you
[21:45] know everybody because with the lockdown
[21:47] everybody just wanted to go out but we
[21:49] couldn't go out and uh because the Lord
[21:51] said we have to buy the tent so
[21:52] everybody put their money together we
[21:54] bought a tent and um brother B every
[21:58] time we had to go to another town
[22:00] brother B would appear to this brother
[22:02] and and elderly sister to tell them the
[22:04] name of the town what we should do in
[22:06] the town what's going to happen in the
[22:08] town to us it was it was amazing yeah so
[22:11] I also asked the brother you know why do
[22:12] you dream about so so often you know and
[22:15] also came to find out that the the farm
[22:17] where brother Brenham in Cape Town came
[22:19] to pray I think on on voice of God you
[22:21] can find it on a meal for the prophet
[22:23] okay uh he went to that farm and and the
[22:25] people in Kalan area in Cape Town W Cape
[22:28] they basically cooked for brother Bren
[22:29] and brother B prayed for the farm and we
[22:33] found out that that brother's mother was
[22:34] working there and when brother B prayed
[22:36] she became pregnant and gave birth to
[22:39] him and he's wow he was I think in
[22:42] 2021 he was he was 7 years old and then
[22:45] all of a sudden he started dreaming
[22:47] about brother Brenham and he had these
[22:48] series of dreams to to say listen you
[22:50] have to buy the t put up a t day so
[22:52] every second month we we take the tent
[22:54] out and we take the whole church with us
[22:57] and for week and we have a Friday
[22:58] Saturday and Sunday service there and
[23:00] what we do is uh uh like I said
[23:02] everything brother Brenham says what's
[23:03] going to happen in the town happens so
[23:05] there was one particular place that
[23:06] brother B said we have to go to in a
[23:09] dream to this brother he said we have to
[23:10] go to hany now nobody in the church had
[23:13] a clue where hky it was it I don't think
[23:16] it's even on the map that's how small
[23:19] that place is Hy wow so and told the
[23:22] brother that in this in this small town
[23:25] called
[23:26] Hy it rained for the last 7 years
[23:31] there's no rain so there's no work the
[23:33] farmers cannot Farm there's no rain it
[23:35] rains all around that City around that
[23:37] town but rain doesn't fall on that town
[23:40] for the last seven years wow so we went
[23:43] to look for the place it's called hanki
[23:45] it's in the Eastern Cape and nobody in
[23:48] our church people we drove past that
[23:50] place many many times but we never knew
[23:53] there was a place called Anki W so we
[23:55] had to go Google search for an we went
[23:56] to an came we came to the area and we
[23:59] spoke to the people try to make
[24:00] preparation for the 10 Services uh we do
[24:03] it like brother bam does it we uh uh
[24:05] invite the message pastors we look
[24:06] around where the closest message
[24:07] churches we invite the Pentecostal
[24:09] pastors all the Pastors in the area we
[24:11] invite them to the service speak to them
[24:13] first and tell them this is what we're
[24:15] going to do not that we need a
[24:16] permission just out of respect because
[24:19] certain cultur s certain uh uh towns
[24:22] work differently if you don't if you
[24:23] don't uh uh inform them about the
[24:26] services then they basically boyot the
[24:28] services so we do it brother bram's way
[24:30] we go around inform them and just out of
[24:33] respect and if they want to support they
[24:34] can support it if they don't want to
[24:35] supported we still continue to to do the
[24:37] work so we went around there and then
[24:40] they they told us it haven't rained for
[24:43] the last s years exactly what brother
[24:45] told us and the brothers it was with us
[24:48] we were like this can't be you know it
[24:50] can never be so while we were there we
[24:53] tested it we said Lord as a brothers
[24:55] let's pray Lord if you really want us to
[24:57] be in this town let it rain today and
[25:00] you won't believe that night it rain
[25:02] like never before just that one day and
[25:05] that same night brother B appeared to
[25:06] the brother and said you see I'm the
[25:08] Elijah for this day Elijah can bring the
[25:10] rain or he can stop the rain so after
[25:13] two months we came with our whole church
[25:15] there and we announced we preach a
[25:16] series on rain and the spirit of Elijah
[25:19] and while we were preaching about Elijah
[25:22] there cannot be Elijah unless there's a
[25:24] jezebel so we understood what the
[25:26] Jezebel comes Elijah Ministry so
[25:29] obviously that town was dominated by the
[25:31] spirit of Jezebel and because of that
[25:34] spirit and wrong worship um what
[25:37] basically happened was that that's why
[25:38] there was drought and we said if they
[25:40] can if they can believe in the spirit of
[25:42] Elijah and what God has done for this
[25:44] day then I believe it will rain and we
[25:46] prophesied rain we prayed for rain and
[25:49] after we left seven days after that it
[25:51] rain it couldn't stop people were
[25:54] calling us emailing us what WhatsApp
[25:57] they said everything they said listen
[25:58] it's crazy here and that the whole
[25:59] Eastern Cape if you go back and you
[26:01] watch the news that the whole Eastern
[26:02] Cape flooded the dams were like 3% full
[26:06] now it's 100% F wow that's how how
[26:09] powerful it became and also one another
[26:12] testimony like I said every time we have
[26:14] to go to a next town then brother B
[26:16] would appear to the brother say listen
[26:17] take the T to this town this town this
[26:19] town so we are doing the whole of South
[26:21] Africa and um what basically happened
[26:23] also the last 10 Revival we had now was
[26:25] in stren area called strand and we went
[26:28] to that area and before we as we went to
[26:31] the area the brother had another dream
[26:32] brother B said listen if the people of
[26:35] that area is not going to listen because
[26:37] it's close to the
[26:38] coastline the the sea is very very close
[26:41] to that to that area okay and uh but the
[26:44] water there is very flat I mean there's
[26:46] no not really waves actually yeah so the
[26:49] brother had a dream and said uh the
[26:51] angel of the Lord appear to him and then
[26:54] it becomes an angel of turn into Angel
[26:55] of the Lord and he said the people of
[26:57] this area listen the waves will come
[26:58] over the
[27:01] so and well I preached it the Saturday I
[27:03] said listen if you don't listen this is
[27:05] going to happen and I mean 14 days after
[27:07] that the whole Western Cape had a
[27:10] problem with big waves coming over and
[27:13] flooded most of the areas in the Western
[27:14] Cape wow so people from Str started
[27:16] listening they came to our services they
[27:18] said wow we didn't we couldn't believe
[27:19] this is happening but God uh there was a
[27:22] double confirmation of it because we
[27:24] also said it's going to flood there and
[27:26] a week after after that also after the
[27:28] two weeks after the waves came over a
[27:31] week after that it started raining in
[27:33] Cape Town and it flooded the whole
[27:35] Western Cape basically so right now we
[27:37] have a problem because those people are
[27:39] running for the services they believe in
[27:41] God so that's that's just small things
[27:44] testimonies that I can share with you
[27:45] and Supernatural things that happened in
[27:47] the tent and and and many many other
[27:48] things people got saved that which is
[27:50] the best medical is the Salvation of
[27:52] people's Souls you know we don't make a
[27:55] we don't major on the Supernatural and
[27:56] stuff like that but it's part of the
[27:58] word of God we do have a balance in the
[28:01] word and the Supernatural and we believe
[28:03] in dreams visions and Angel visitations
[28:05] and we believe in the Revival as brother
[28:07] bam said there will be a bright Revival
[28:09] sure what's it like living in a town
[28:12] like Cape Town where there's so many
[28:13] different I mean there's like you were
[28:14] saying here the other night there's so
[28:16] many different people from around the
[28:18] world that live there what's it like
[28:20] living there well um kton is a is a is a
[28:24] very very exciting place to stay like I
[28:26] said um I think every year basically
[28:28] it's part of the it it it's the number
[28:30] one city when it comes to the Seven
[28:32] Wonders around the world they chose
[28:33] cities I think it's also one of the best
[28:35] uh tourism attractive places in the
[28:38] world but sin is on a high alert but
[28:41] Isaiah says when the enemy comes in like
[28:43] a flood of spirit of God will raise a
[28:44] standard you know so we are trying
[28:46] really trying our best and um to reach
[28:50] out to the lost and uh um we're actually
[28:54] blessed in Cape Town because um all the
[28:56] other
[28:58] um provinces we call it provinces I
[28:59] think you call it states all the other
[29:01] states is basically uh ruled by by the
[29:06] ANC party and I mean poverty is hitting
[29:08] South Africa like never before but Cape
[29:10] Town is still surviving because we under
[29:12] uh another uh political party that
[29:15] basically believe God and they they
[29:18] really sustain cap toown and that's why
[29:20] captown is still in the good very good
[29:22] condition and um but that's why we take
[29:24] advantage of that to also take the
[29:26] Gospel of Jesus Christ out as quickly as
[29:27] possible because the rule they're
[29:29] getting Stricker and strier with the
[29:30] governmental rules they don't want 10
[29:32] revivals anymore so we really pray and
[29:35] but God working people's hearts you know
[29:37] and God open doors for us wherever we go
[29:41] uh basically the the mayor of the area
[29:43] of the mayor of the city will tell us no
[29:44] no no I want you to have the service
[29:46] here because there's so much gangsterism
[29:48] so much drug addiction and and things
[29:50] like that going on and I'm telling you
[29:52] that when we went to strand uh days
[29:55] before we went there there was a a a a
[29:57] violent gang fight that basically broke
[29:59] out and people were shoting and killing
[30:02] each other like like crazy even our
[30:04] church wanted to know are you really
[30:05] going to go there I said if the Lord say
[30:07] we go we going you know we're not on a
[30:09] on a picnic we on a on a battlefield
[30:12] yeah so by faith we went and to our
[30:14] amazement when we put up the 10 the gang
[30:16] fight stopped the shooting stopped oh
[30:18] wow and after we we left the area I
[30:22] think up till today there's never been a
[30:24] gun shot again no gangsterism no fights
[30:26] no nothing but it's only the grace of
[30:28] God and God get all the honor you know
[30:30] and uh we know the last move of God it's
[30:33] not going to be a man it's not a one man
[30:37] Ministry um 1 Thessalonian 4:16 says the
[30:40] Lord himself will descend with a shout
[30:42] with a voice in a trump so I believe God
[30:44] himself is coming down to do something
[30:47] powerful in his last days as he promised
[30:49] I'll pour out my spirit you know so no
[30:51] Cape Town definitely things are changing
[30:53] and we have the faith to to do um to
[30:57] basically bring that whole city to a
[30:59] stands still for Christ and when to turn
[31:01] the whole city for Christ obviously we
[31:03] know there's only the predestinated seed
[31:04] that can come to the lord well how often
[31:07] are y'all having these Ted meetings or
[31:09] Ted revivals is it just when you feel
[31:11] like the Lord is leading you to have
[31:13] them or do you have like yeah but says
[31:15] you have to be inspired so when God
[31:18] inspires us um you know uh we know it's
[31:21] the word of God and like I said it's
[31:24] amazing because every second month we're
[31:25] trying to have it because it's a lot of
[31:27] money and we travel with the old church
[31:29] obviously the brothers sleep in the tent
[31:31] but we try to get accommodation for the
[31:32] Sisters as cheap as we can and we take
[31:35] our own food with you know we take the
[31:36] whole church because it's more effective
[31:38] when we take a crowd like we know there
[31:41] have to be attraction sure you know so
[31:43] when we we realize when we take a whole
[31:45] crowd with we bring that whole small
[31:47] town to a stand still because everybody
[31:48] to know who's all these cars who where's
[31:50] all these people coming from and then on
[31:53] what we also do we go through the
[31:54] streets and Advertiser services and we
[31:56] also put up uh a posters and we also
[31:59] like I said we go to the churches and
[32:00] give them the invitation letters and
[32:02] then we also send our youth and our
[32:04] elders through the streets and the
[32:05] sisters and we try to evangelize and try
[32:07] to to reach out to the community and
[32:09] invite the people and also go from house
[32:11] to house and try to pray for the people
[32:13] and it's been so effective so effective
[32:15] but what we do we try to do it every
[32:16] second month because it's a lot of work
[32:18] a have money for sure and to put up a
[32:20] tent it's not easy no I mean um so we do
[32:23] a Friday Saturday Sunday so and then we
[32:25] have lunch together as a church and then
[32:27] when while everybody's there we we uh
[32:30] break down the tent because like I said
[32:32] it's a lot of work a lot of trucks a lot
[32:33] of uh um buies that we have to use uh to
[32:39] to transport the stuff yet so about how
[32:41] many people are in the group that travel
[32:43] with you every other month to do this
[32:45] mostly most of those who are available
[32:47] go so we over over 1 15200 that normally
[32:50] travels that's awesome yeah so we TR
[32:52] with everybody everybody wants to be
[32:53] part of it because if you he like
[32:56] brother appear in a dream we have to go
[32:58] to this town this is going to happen
[33:00] this is going to happen you're going to
[33:00] want to go people I mean even the even
[33:03] the sisters husbands it's not safe they
[33:05] say I want to go see it yeah is this
[33:06] really going to take place and obviously
[33:08] it takes place and like I said it's God
[33:10] and um and we just honor him and if we
[33:12] can put the the honor at the right in
[33:14] the right place you know God can place
[33:16] and trust us even the more and that's
[33:17] what we want to do sure and um God said
[33:20] if we can be faithful and doing the
[33:22] small towns I mean we started with towns
[33:24] like oh it was bad we started with the
[33:27] poorest of the poorest towns places
[33:29] people no nobody wants to go there
[33:31] nobody wants to start a churs nobody
[33:32] even want to have church there so God
[33:34] tested us was with that so we were
[33:36] faithful with that and then God said I
[33:38] will trust you with bigger and bigger
[33:39] and bigger and then later on he said
[33:41] listen I want you to move from Province
[33:43] from state to state so we are we're
[33:45] going to travel through the whole of
[33:45] South Africa I think um next year we are
[33:48] planning to go maybe uh to Johannesburg
[33:51] Petoria and and and Bloom Fontaine
[33:54] places like that and it's so amazing one
[33:56] brother another guy came to us uh the
[33:58] brother is in our church but his
[34:00] brother-in-law is not safe he came to us
[34:02] the other day and he said listen I got
[34:04] big trucks whenever you guys need to use
[34:06] it you can use it oh wow that's amazing
[34:08] and this how God provides for himself
[34:10] because it was a problem to us because
[34:12] we had only this like you call it a a
[34:14] truck small trucks you call it the baky
[34:17] South Africa so we only had a baky with
[34:18] the big trailer and then we pull the the
[34:20] chairs and the sound system and we take
[34:23] everything with but now with this guy
[34:24] coming up with all the the big trucks
[34:26] said no I have huge Tru you can just you
[34:28] can use it you can anytime you want to
[34:31] and it's just how God provides for you
[34:34] know it's just a blessing um another
[34:37] thing do you if do you have anything
[34:40] that you feel like the lord has laid on
[34:41] your heart here recently that you would
[34:43] like to share you know from this past
[34:45] week or anything like that that you
[34:48] would just like to share with yeah we
[34:49] had it was a wonderful wonderful uh week
[34:52] I mean this Feast of Tabernacles was was
[34:54] something to experience it was
[34:56] experience of a lifetime but what I I
[34:58] just want to uh encourage the youth
[35:01] because why God's plan is a youth plan
[35:03] and uh in the message we are losing a
[35:05] lot of our young people sure all over
[35:08] you can see all over the world basically
[35:09] in the message of the hour our young
[35:11] people are leaving the message and um I
[35:13] just want to encourage them with this
[35:15] there's two very important things that
[35:16] you have to find in your youth that's
[35:18] very important it's in the Bible it's
[35:20] very important to find this in your
[35:22] youth the first thing that you have to
[35:24] find in your youth is Ecclesiastes 12:
[35:27] one it says the Bible says there um
[35:30] remember your creator in the days of
[35:33] your youth before the evil days come I
[35:35] don't know why God Called It the evil
[35:37] days that's basically if you miss God in
[35:39] your Youth and you only find God at a
[35:41] very old age the Bible caused evil it
[35:43] caus it's not going to be uh exciting
[35:46] years because you can't jump and shout
[35:47] and travel and take the gospel out uh as
[35:51] when you were a young man so the first
[35:53] thing the Bible says you have to find
[35:55] your Creator and you have think about to
[35:57] create a new youth so according to the
[35:59] scripture God will always introduce
[36:02] himself in your childhood in your youth
[36:06] years maybe you can miss him but
[36:08] according to the scripture he always
[36:10] comes to you in your youth years like
[36:11] David said I serve the Lord from my
[36:13] youth so it's important to find God in
[36:15] your youth very important absolutely
[36:18] important um because otherwise you will
[36:21] only have Wasted Years so many people
[36:23] miss that to find God in their youth
[36:26] they're so busy with sin and drinking
[36:28] and party and smoking that they missed
[36:30] the opportunity where God actually
[36:32] introduced himself to them so that's
[36:34] what this scripture is saying remember
[36:36] thy Creator in the days of your youth
[36:37] the second thing is very important and
[36:39] brother B also take those two things
[36:41] it's so amazing Proverbs 5:8 says uh
[36:44] Rejoice with the wife of your youth so
[36:47] the first thing you need to find in your
[36:49] youth is you need to find your Creator
[36:51] and the second thing you need to find in
[36:52] your youth is your
[36:53] wife and I always tell the people listen
[36:57] don't be so busy with things of the
[36:58] world that you miss your opportunity
[37:00] with your wife so God introduces himself
[37:03] in your life when you y yeah and then
[37:06] the second thing God will introduce to
[37:08] you is your wife in your youth years
[37:11] because the Bible says in Proverbs 5:18
[37:14] uh Rejoice with the wife of your Youth
[37:18] and many people they're so busy with
[37:20] worldly things they met God they meet
[37:22] God only when have encounter with God
[37:24] when they're very old and then they
[37:26] realize they also miss the the woman or
[37:28] the the lady they were supposed to get
[37:30] married with so that's why I always tell
[37:32] our youth listen God will introduce
[37:34] himself to you as a young man and he
[37:36] will also bring your wife and that's
[37:37] what brother bam also says he says
[37:39] outside of eternal life the best thing
[37:40] God can do to you is to give you a Godly
[37:42] wife so that's my advice to young people
[37:45] is to to seek after God and this is what
[37:49] I want to say about Sin as well sin have
[37:52] no Heights it only have depths for sure
[37:55] sin have no promotion it only have
[37:57] demotions it only demotes you that's why
[38:00] the devil was demoted sin started in
[38:02] heaven and he fell and sin that's what
[38:06] sin will do sin is a unsatisfied thing
[38:10] you will go from smoking this to smoking
[38:13] that and uh to get satisfied and you
[38:16] never get satisfied you can um you drink
[38:21] this wine and then you want to drink
[38:22] something stronger to satisfy yourself
[38:24] to drink something more stronger you
[38:25] will go from wine to wine drinking this
[38:28] to drinking that to drinking the other
[38:30] thing smoking this to smoking that try
[38:32] to satisfy yourself but you cannot
[38:33] satisfy yourself you will go from woman
[38:35] to woman and you cannot satisfy yourself
[38:37] because there's no satisfaction in sin
[38:40] and the only satisfaction is in Christ
[38:44] we were all
[38:45] born um with that nature of seeking
[38:48] thirsting and looking but many people
[38:51] unfortunately never
[38:53] realize that that what they are actually
[38:55] searching looking for is their soul
[38:57] that's crying out the Deep calling to
[38:59] the Deep right and they try to satisfy
[39:01] it with the wrong material the wrong
[39:03] things at the wrong places and people
[39:06] since your birth you are looking
[39:07] searching and and and and because when
[39:10] you look at a baby when the baby is born
[39:12] amazingly how that baby will look for
[39:15] his mother's breast his head will go
[39:18] like this because since you are born you
[39:21] are searching and looking and many
[39:23] people it's a heartbreaking to say they
[39:25] even all but still looking and searching
[39:27] and they don't know what they're looking
[39:28] and searching for I remember when we
[39:31] used to use drugs or drink a lot you
[39:35] will never sleep you will like you're
[39:37] looking for something you're walking
[39:38] around you're seeking for something like
[39:41] sometimes do bar will close down at 12:
[39:44] but still be not satisfied then we'll
[39:46] look for another bar that's still open
[39:47] till till late and you will walk and
[39:49] walk and walk without
[39:52] realizing why do you walk so far you
[39:55] will you you searching for something
[39:56] something and you don't know what you're
[39:57] looking from there without realizing
[39:59] it's Christ you're looking for and
[40:01] that's why I believe we have to have
[40:02] open Air Services we as Christians they
[40:05] have to advertise Jesus Christ because
[40:07] people are thirsty people are seeking
[40:10] people are looking and they don't know
[40:12] that they're actually looking for Jesus
[40:14] Christ you cannot satisfy your soul with
[40:17] with drinking smoking and World things
[40:19] the only thing you can satisfy your soul
[40:20] is with Jesus Christ in the Holy Spirit
[40:22] PR sure back to what you were saying
[40:24] earlier about when you were out partying
[40:27] and drinking and stuff and um talking
[40:30] about like someone coming up and like
[40:32] preaching to you whatever that doesn't
[40:33] help you at all yeah and me and benjin
[40:36] have experienced this kind of sort of
[40:38] the same thing cuz uh we play a lot of
[40:40] like softball together and stuff and we
[40:43] have a lot of friends on our teams you
[40:45] know that don't know anything about the
[40:46] Lord or if they think it's very little
[40:48] and instead of you know going up to them
[40:51] and preaching about what they're doing
[40:52] wrong and how they should be living we
[40:55] usually just don't say anything and let
[40:57] the Lord be a light through us and I
[41:00] would say nine times out of 10 someone
[41:02] will come up to us be like all right
[41:03] what's different about you like what
[41:06] there's definitely something about y'all
[41:08] that draws us to you what is different
[41:10] and then that way through that we're
[41:12] able to share with them yeah the best
[41:13] thing is to live the life and like you
[41:15] did this it's wisdom because a sinner
[41:17] don't want you to to preach to them and
[41:19] neck on them they want them as brother
[41:21] says live a life yeah that will make
[41:23] them thirsty we are the salt of the of
[41:24] the world we must make them thirsty MH
[41:26] that's why we have to make Christianity
[41:28] so exciting like you said now they must
[41:30] say wait something is missing why do you
[41:32] guys look like this why do you guys look
[41:33] so happy and exciting because what we
[41:35] have you cannot go by it you know at a
[41:39] bar or wherever what we have you need to
[41:41] get it by Christ but you need a life
[41:43] that's exciting that's attractive and
[41:46] attracting people to Jesus Christ
[41:48] because we are a billboard basically you
[41:50] know when people look at us we we are
[41:51] advertising something for sure and we
[41:53] have to just live that life and that
[41:55] will dra people and make them thirsty uh
[41:59] to to be like you like with me and my
[42:01] wife now we make it we make Christianity
[42:02] so exciting when we go to them balls or
[42:04] wherever you know people say wow what is
[42:07] it about you guys we just you know but
[42:08] you have to draw them to Jesus Christ
[42:10] and at the same time God will be there
[42:12] to to to provide whatever is needed I
[42:15] told our brothers we had a very poor
[42:17] church only this year God started to
[42:19] bless our church and I told the church
[42:21] you know if we can only know if God can
[42:24] trust us what cause money houses and we
[42:27] can use that for
[42:30] God that people will be thrown to that
[42:33] because they have to be an attraction
[42:35] and right now most of the churches in
[42:37] our areas is doing what we are doing
[42:39] they also traveling now with tents and
[42:40] they also want to go out in young people
[42:43] even out lately now a lot of gangsters
[42:46] most of the top gangsters in the uh the
[42:49] gangsters children they all come to our
[42:51] church wow even even even gang leaders
[42:55] are calling us listen I don't want my
[42:56] child to smoke drugs because I use drugs
[42:59] and he's a gang leader he would say
[43:00] can't you take my child to church to
[43:02] your church I want my child to go to
[43:03] your church wow because I can see you
[43:05] are busy with God you're not playing
[43:06] because you must remember many people in
[43:08] the gospel are playing with the gospel
[43:09] they are fooling around and um you
[43:12] cannot lie to the people the people can
[43:13] see who's really living the life for
[43:15] sure and who's not living the life so um
[43:18] at the moment now we are doing very good
[43:20] in our area it's very very good and we
[43:22] are also it's inspiring other churches
[43:24] to do also the same and uh we don't
[43:27] encourage people to leave their churches
[43:29] you know God's chosen place of worship
[43:31] and that's why many of the leaders in
[43:32] our area respect us because we respect
[43:35] them as brother Benham taught us to
[43:36] respect other churches but eventually
[43:39] you know people just say no we want to
[43:40] be here we want to be in the church like
[43:42] that's traveling that's going around
[43:44] because uh HEI chapter 2 says a
[43:46] wonderful thing he says the desires of
[43:48] the Nations will come to the house of
[43:49] the Lord he said the silver and the gold
[43:51] Belongs to the Lord you know and he said
[43:54] all the Treasures of the world world he
[43:56] will bring to the house of God our kids
[43:59] used to run to all the to the gangsters
[44:02] because they had the cars they had the
[44:04] money they had everything and in our
[44:07] area right now God is giving the church
[44:10] everything so now the people is running
[44:12] to the church you know there's an
[44:14] attraction to the church so we are so
[44:15] busy and so exciting with this even my
[44:17] trip coming here is very encouraging
[44:19] there's even by me flying here even
[44:22] worthly people calls us and send
[44:24] messages W can God do that
[44:26] I want to travel I want to go to places
[44:28] I want to see America all things are
[44:30] possible if you just uh Surrender Your
[44:33] Life to Jesus Christ and I used to tell
[44:35] the people when I was drinking and
[44:37] smoking I would meet people and I might
[44:40] not have money to go to another city but
[44:43] by with drinking by drinking with this
[44:45] man he would tell me listen come with me
[44:48] tonight or come let's go to that place
[44:49] that place you know so by drinking I met
[44:52] friends to
[44:53] travel but now I tell the people you
[44:56] don't need I I told him wine and alcohol
[44:59] and drugs took me places but with Jesus
[45:01] Christ I can go further and deeper and
[45:03] higher I mean look yeah I'm in America
[45:05] by this Grace you know we would see
[45:07] America on the TV and say we only saw it
[45:09] on the TV and said wow wow I wish I
[45:12] never thought we going to be in America
[45:14] one day you know but by the grace of God
[45:16] it just shows people it shows I want to
[45:17] encourage people to if you s end your
[45:20] life to God he can give you a beautiful
[45:23] wife he could give you a beautiful he
[45:24] could give you a what whatever your
[45:26] heart desire but you have to serve him
[45:29] and the question is can God trust you
[45:31] for sure you know good because we want
[45:33] to do more for him and God have to trust
[45:36] us with more and I always tell when in
[45:38] our people preach about blessings and
[45:40] blessings but there's a scripture in
[45:41] Matthew 25 where it says that God bless
[45:44] you according to your ability he gave
[45:46] talents according to Ability so I told
[45:48] the church work on your ability can God
[45:50] trust us and if God can trust us God can
[45:53] bless us and God can use those blessings
[45:56] to do more for God and that's what we
[45:58] want to do we want to shut down drug
[46:01] houses we want to shut down uh whatever
[46:04] material there is to do sin and and to
[46:07] entertain sin we want to shut down at
[46:09] the moment now there's a lot of
[46:10] nightclubs that's closing really um and
[46:14] and and the people is telling us you can
[46:15] use this area to have church we're not
[46:17] going to we're not going to use this as
[46:18] a nightclub anymore so you can take it
[46:21] you can do whatever if you want to have
[46:22] church and obviously we prayed about it
[46:24] and there's people coming now and say
[46:25] listen we don't want to use this place
[46:28] uh for sin anymore please you guys can
[46:29] use it for for the Youth you can take
[46:31] this for the Youth or use this for the
[46:33] things of of God because people are
[46:35] realizing that like Solomon said it's
[46:37] vanity or vanity worldly things and to
[46:39] be busy with sin it will only demote you
[46:41] yeah but I we even now have a guy he's
[46:45] been a gangster his whole life and he
[46:47] said listen I I can't live like this I
[46:49] just want to do something for God I've
[46:51] messed up a lot of communities I've
[46:53] messed up a lot of things in my life and
[46:55] uh it's amazing how God just work and
[46:57] provide for himself you know it's
[46:59] amazing uh do y'all have a lot of Youth
[47:01] in y''s church you did yeah yeah we do
[47:04] have I think half of our church is youth
[47:06] oh it's awesome that's awesome it's nice
[47:07] to have a a balanced church we have old
[47:09] people and a lot of young married
[47:12] couples at the moment now um a lot of
[47:15] our youth is getting married and it's a
[47:16] good thing just many young uh a strong
[47:19] church is a um is when you have married
[47:23] couples you have to have a strong family
[47:24] to have a strong Church
[47:26] so that's what's happening in our church
[47:27] now and there's one guy his father was
[47:30] one of the biggest gangsters in the
[47:31] Western Cape biggest biggest gangsters
[47:34] his father died and they killed his
[47:36] father and he was like the right hand
[47:38] man but two three years ago he gave his
[47:40] life to the Lord served with us and he
[47:43] couldn't believe um must I only have one
[47:45] woman in my life because his father used
[47:48] to have a lot of woman and he said no I
[47:50] must have a lot of woman I must have
[47:51] more than one and he came to church we
[47:53] used to go to school together and he
[47:55] said I can't believe the two of you um
[47:57] do do you only have one wife and I said
[48:00] no the Bible says You must one have one
[48:01] wife and the people in our area couldn't
[48:03] believe it he gave his life to the Lord
[48:05] he got married I think his baby is now a
[48:07] few months old and he's so dedicated to
[48:09] God he's so he he loves God with
[48:11] everything that's in him people couldn't
[48:13] couldn't believe that he changed his
[48:14] life just like that and he's serving God
[48:17] and he's got one wife now and he says no
[48:19] I I never knew you know you have to be
[48:21] that's actually a man a real man is a
[48:24] man that can have only one wife
[48:26] sure you know and a Sanctified life and
[48:28] look after his children and his family
[48:30] because that's very very important and
[48:32] that's what we want to do we want as a
[48:34] church we have we're not only a church
[48:35] for our church we are there for the
[48:37] community we are there to to bring
[48:39] changes in people's lives God bless some
[48:41] of our brothers in our chch with with
[48:43] nice cars so now uh uh I think last
[48:46] week there was a lot of matrick balls um
[48:50] basically it uh the great 12 came to the
[48:53] end of the year and then they have a
[48:54] function where they they go out to the
[48:56] school with they uh TR stop obviously
[48:59] and they have like a like a bowl I don't
[49:01] know if you have yeah it's like for us
[49:03] it we call like a prom prom that's right
[49:06] with a prom yeah so they had the prom
[49:08] and all these young kids know you know
[49:10] their mothers are so poor they they
[49:12] don't have cars too because obviously
[49:13] everybody's standing outside and they
[49:15] have to come and drive in with a car and
[49:17] things like that so Brothers in out CHS
[49:19] you know they went to the community and
[49:20] say whatever your children need we will
[49:21] drive we will take them we look after
[49:23] them so basically everybody in now
[49:25] Church to use their cars to take the
[49:27] children to the promise and you know
[49:29] those kids said wow no we want to come
[49:32] to your church we want to you know and
[49:34] they were so thankful they were so
[49:35] thankful yeah we did it for free we said
[49:37] listen we just want to Y our community
[49:39] and reach out to our community and it it
[49:41] I'm it it means a lot to people it means
[49:43] really and that just a little bit of
[49:45] kindness a little bit of kindness to
[49:47] bring a handful of people to y''s church
[49:49] and for them to surrender yeah because
[49:50] you have to understand some of these
[49:52] kids don't have fathers they don't have
[49:53] mothers the grandparents raise them they
[49:55] have no money there's nothing but um
[49:58] like I said the best opportunity is to
[50:00] serve God and people have to grab that
[50:03] and when you have Christ you got
[50:05] everything you don't do we don't do
[50:07] church with money we do Church By Faith
[50:09] so every we do every 10 Revival every
[50:12] service every says God likes a man that
[50:15] can take the challenge everything we do
[50:16] we do it by faith I always tell the
[50:18] people money don't bring Faith but Faith
[50:20] brings money and whatever we need we we
[50:24] do it by faith so what we need we don't
[50:26] need a new job or a better car better
[50:29] house what you need is Faith and when
[50:31] you have faith you can have your house
[50:32] your job your promotion whatever you
[50:34] need in life so the greatest the
[50:36] greatest crisis we have I preach on on
[50:38] it the faith crisis the the greatest
[50:41] crisis we have is not a job crisis or a
[50:44] financial crisis or whatever oil crisis
[50:48] the biggest crisis we have today
[50:49] according to the word of God is a faith
[50:51] crisis sure so people need Faith cuz
[50:54] Jesus says in his word if I come when I
[50:56] find Faith you know so faith is the most
[50:59] important thing that we need in today
[51:01] and it's a weapon basically so if you
[51:03] have faith I always tell people you
[51:05] don't need a new car you don't need a
[51:06] chop you don't need nothing you need
[51:08] faith and Romans chap 10 says faith
[51:10] cometh by hearing and no man can preach
[51:13] unless he's sinned by God and that's
[51:15] what the Bible says you cannot hear
[51:17] without a preacher and a preacher cannot
[51:19] come unless he s so not any preacher
[51:21] produces Faith a sin preacher produces
[51:23] Faith so people need to come under a
[51:25] preacher that sent from God like brother
[51:28] B was sent from God and that's why there
[51:30] was healing there was faith for healing
[51:31] there was faithful first po second po
[51:33] third po because um he was a sent
[51:36] preacher from and after brother I I
[51:39] think we need more s men get s from God
[51:42] and you definitely have to have a
[51:43] revelation of who your pastor and you
[51:45] know where you have to go to church is
[51:46] too exactly very important because your
[51:48] pastor will see you through for sure you
[51:50] know even the lifestyle and even the way
[51:53] your every Pastor is raised up in and
[51:55] the things you goes through life the
[51:56] storms and the battles and The Valleys
[51:58] you will see how it will t with people
