========================================
[Music] hi I'm Joshua shell and I'd like to welcome you back to another nhrm podcast we just got done having uh our weekend Fellowship meetings and we were honored to have uh brother Dwayne Jackson here speaking for us and uh we got we decided it' be a good idea to get him to come on the podcast to tell his testimony and just whatever the lord has laid in his heart and so we'd like to welcome brother Dwayne Jackson to the podcast thank you for coming on with me I appreciate it thank you so much I certainly appreciate the invitation brother Joshua I've have enjoyed watching the uh the podcast that I've seen so far and has been a blessing to me and um I I pray that something that could be said today would would be uplifting to somebody else I like I said I appreciate you coming on being willing to do it and even stay in an extra day just to be able to do this with me um but we're just going to jump into it I'd love to hear your testimony you know how where you born raised and and how you came to the lord well um I was I was born into a Christian home um the my parents both were um already Believers uh within the message my mom's uncle was the pastor of the church that they attended brother henard Green in Ruth North Carolina so I I felt for that um in looking back that I was born into a family that already um was a a solid Christian family and Believers of end time message and um it took me a long time in my life uh to to grow to a place that I understood that just because they had an experience and I had witnessed God moving in their life it took me me um took me quite a few years up into my teens to really understand that I had to have that same experience and it it wasn't just good enough uh that my dad sure had great personal experiences and I witnessed things happening in in his life and in my mom's life it it just took me a little bit of time to recognize that um them having the Holy Ghost wasn't the same as me having the everybody's got to have their own experience each one of us have to have our own personal experience and um I I'm I'm thankful that that God revealed that to me um it was sometimes I I feel that it's um even difficult for young people growing up in a uh a Christian home and in a in a um a church group that that follows the teaching of brother brandom to to really realize that just by going to church is not enough um just by following some rules um some boundaries that have been placed before them uh my parents did that for me they they placed boundaries and I I didn't always abide by them and uh they gave me Grace and actually just just recently I was talking with my mom um about a situation and and she's like we knew the things that was going on she said but we prayed for you every single day and we prayed that God would show you that the things that you the places you were going the things you were doing were not of him and and he did he he he revealed that to me um he he he came down in a special way for me in 1988 um I was at a Bible camp that was being put on uh by brother Mike sever um up in um up in Ohio it was Ohio and um I'd went to the camp quite a few times and this particular year that we went the camp had been double booked and so they had two groups of people trying to come in and stay at the campground at the very same week and it was a I I remember the day that we got there and everything was um just a mess and they were trying to figure out what they were going to do so our group ended up having to go to a Boy Scout camp so it took a little bit of time and they got everybody moved over to a Boy Scout camp and they set up a makeshift um uh area to have a pull pit and and uh a stage they actually pulled a um just a flatbed trailer out into a field and set up a tent and set up chairs and that's that's where we had Church set up the the organ and the piano and um they were having to wire in some light bulbs and stuff so we could have some light in there but it was during that meeting that the Lord came down and dealt with me directly and it was all the way to the end of the week um it was a Friday night and that evening the the after the service was over um and the anointing was was moving there was a lot of people that was praying and staying Under the Tent I left at as they said you could be dismissed I left out from the tent and behind the tent up on the hill there was a a basketball court and I'd walked up to the to that area but it was still within ear shock of what was going on at the down at the tent and I was standing around watching the guys play some basketball and I really wasn't into playing basketball but I just wanted to be around them but as I stood there I kept hearing the music being played and I said well I'm just going to go and and walk back down to the tent and just kind of hang around outside the tent so I did that for a little bit I I stood there and just listened to the the music being played and hearing the people praying and then finally I said well I'll just I'll slip inside and just sit on the back seat I tired standing up so I'll just I'll just sit on the back row and and I I love music so I just wanted to listen to the music that's what I thought um so I I go in and and actually think there was some people in the very back so I found a row that there wasn't many people and I slipped in and sat down and don't know how long I was there but I do what I remember is that at some point I found myself kneeling at that chair old metal chair I was kneeling on the grass and praying and I could feel that that God was drawing me and pulling me and I just started praying and I just I was praying I said Lord I don't I don't even know what to say I don't know what I supposed to do I I know that I need you and I don't know who it was to this day I don't know who it was it might have been an angel that that came down and place their hands upon my back but at one point I felt hands wrapped around my shoulders oh and voices praying I never opened my eyes I don't know who it was but they prayed with me for 20 minutes or or or more praying and and their voice and their voice they were praying that I would be filled with the Holy Ghost and it was that Friday night that God came down and placed a portion of himself in my heart and in my life and changed my life I mean completely changed my life um the directions that I had things that I thought that I wanted to do um completely changed and uh I I I knew that I had I had given myself to him and received him into my life and then you know I was still in high school and still involved in in music uh within school and even though I'd had an experience I did not always yield myself fully to that um I allowed myself to um to vary and and stray in in different aspects of my life and and do things and and that uh it's not edifying and and don't like to bring those those things up because I know that God has pulled me from those things and and took me out of that but I went through um finished finished high school in uh 1990 um heavily involved in in the music Within school and then within church and I felt that things was just you know I was doing what I was supposed to do when I was yeah going to church and you know that's I was uh making my mom and dad happy because that's where they wanted to see me in church and but I had never gotten to the place that I really fully surrendered everything over to him um I was still holding things back you know it it took me a while to to realize that I I watched my my friends that were in in my same age um at church getting married and and move on and start having children and it just didn't seem like that was my lot um at the time um and and until quite a few years later before I ended up meeting um Heather um with would become my wife shortly after we met um we actually met due to a um a mutual friend that was getting married um I had a passion for photography um there for for a while and and I had went and purchased different types of equipment and and gotten really involved in in doing photography and and some friends of ours found out and they found out that I had taken uh some wedding pictures for a couple other people and so they they asked would you be willing to come and uh do the the photography for our daughter's wedding and it was going to happen over in Gastonia North Carolina and I said sure be happy to and um so I go to that wedding and that was um June the 8th of 20 3 and on that day I had no clue that that was going to be a day that absolutely changed my life forever because it was a young lady that her family I was mutual friends with the one getting married and so they had come up from Georgia to attend the wedding after the wedding was over um my pastor who was brother Dan daisley um at that time he spoke with brother Daniel G and D who was um Heather's pastor and they were there at the wedding together and he invited him to come to our church and Minister on that that following Sunday so they did they came to church and I happened to be the one that was leading the songs that morning I wish I could remember what songs I sang that day I wish I would have written them down um but during the song service um I was singing a song and I kind of looked up at the congregation and noticed that there was a young lady sitting over on the left-and side that was just absolutely beautiful and completely lost the words to the song that I was singing I just I could not remember where I was at and I was I it took me a few few moments to find where we were with this the songs but I could not keep my mind off of her and um I was trying to pay attention to what I was supposed to be doing the song service but she caught my eye and it was it was I had heard throughout my life that um you would just know you know whenever you meet the right one you would just know I didn't know that it was going to take me 30 years to meet the right one um but whenever I saw her and it was just something something about her her smile just caught my eye and I I could not keep from looking over I would try to try to keep but I couldn't I keep looking over and seeing her there and um so I started asking questions um to those that came with her to find out who she was you know who with her parents and um whether or not cuz at the time she was she was holding a little baby baby um and that had gave me a little pause for concern I was like surely that's not her baby and it wasn't it was a cousin of hers that she was holding so I I contacted um I guess it was about a week and a half after that um I didn't get to speak to her I don't think I shook her hand that day at church I was too nervous um but I did speak to her or I think I spoke to her dad and at that time we were in the process of uh building a new sanctuary and they had recently upgraded some sound equipment in their sanctuary and he told me he said well I was kind of one of the ones that's helping take charge of sound equipment and he said um he said why don't you come down and you can visit our church sometime and you can see the sound equipment so I accepted that invitation quickly and um and went down but in between that time I had called her pastor and inquired about her to find out if she was um you know if she was already talking with someone and if if he if he felt that I was um would be out of line because of uh I didn't I found out that her her age was a little bit younger than me uh about 13 years younger than I and uh so I I didn't want it to be super awkward to try to talk with her and then offend someone um so I talked with him and and he said you know I I I think you'd be okay you know you you'd be received if you was to talk with her dad and um so um about 3 weeks after um well that was June the 8th it was um July the 5th um we I went down they were having a a function at their Church and um some activities as such um celebrating the July 4th uh weekend and so I went down and um the women I all went off to for some function they were doing and the the brothers had went up to uh Bass Pro Shop and uh so I took that um chance to go and hang out and be around her dad for a little bit cuz didn't know him he didn't know me and we got back from the bass proo shop and um we um we were sitting out in his um in his driveway and in my in my Jeep and um I spoke to him for about an hour and a half sitting in his driveway um all this time I didn't know that Heather and her mom and her sister were in the house looking out the window and she's like why is he out there talking to Dad for that that long what what is going on but I expressed to her Dan that um that I would like to court his daughter um and not long before that happened I had done a lot of reading um through the different messages of uh concerning dating and courtship and I felt that that was the correct way to approach um even though I had not even spoken to her to ask her if she would was interested in me so you hadn't said anything to her I said nothing I had sh I had shook her hand at one of the services at their church and we had all as a group had went out to eat and she was babysitting that little the little girl again and I think I made a comment of oh I see your babysitting again that was the extent of our conversations that we had had up to this point so I talked with her dad for a long time and I asked him uh I wanted his permission um to court his daughter and he said um he said well AB that the finality of it he says I will talk to her see if she's interested if she would like to be courted by you or not and then I'll let you know and I didn't want to wait too long said I already waited long enough I didn't want to wait too long so he um I stayed in the in the Jeep for a little bit and he went inside and Heather's story to me um is that when he came in they were all you know what is going on and she said that he you know sat down with her um in the living room and he he said I'm just going to tell you how it is he said um he likes you a lot and um he wants to court you and I feel if you say yes that you're that you'll accept his courtship you'll probably end up getting married and she said okay and that was it that was how that was how it was and and from then that evening a group of people was going out to uh Longhorn um Steakhouse and so show up to pick her up well to Rite actually I think I rode with her mom and dad and her and we all rode together to longor and we're sitting at longor and I'm thinking recording and we really don't know each other yet and uh it was a little awkward at at the beginning um but it didn't stay awkward too long um that happened July the 5th of 20 three is that right yeah 2003 and then I proposed to her August the 23rd of 2003 wow that was how serious I was that that's how I how how I knew that we were meant for each other and then she was the one that that I had been waiting for and so I proposed August the 23rd and then we got married November 22nd of the same year 2003 and um like most um you know Newly Weds and uh married couples they have a desire to um to have children and we we had that same desire we we both um both wanted to have a family um I I only I had two siblings two sisters um she um she only had one sister um but my dad's family and my mom's family were both large families my dad came out of a family of 12 kids oh wow he was the seventh child out of 12 and my mom came out of a family of seven so I was used to having a lot of cousins and aunts and uncles around um so we we both wanted to have children and um and just expected that it would come easy we we saw so many other other of our friends that would get married and you know within a year or so you know they're already pregnant and having having children come on and um so about 15 months I guess it was into um our marriage age uh she became pregnant I guess about 14 months she became pregnant and um and then about eight I think she was about eight weeks along eight or 10 weeks along and um we experienced a miscarriage um which was very was very difficult um put a a lot of strain um on the on the two of us um emotional spiritual strain sure um didn't understand you know why is it why is it easy for some and and not easy for others and um we really felt that that that was God's plan for us was to to have children and so after the um the time of the miscarriage um we went on for several years just expecting that that um that it would happen and month after month and months turn into years and still not happening and it really um it really put a strain um between the two of us um not so much a rift between the two of us but it was just a a strain a battle um trying to understand why there would be a delay for sure why you know we can't we go to the doctors and speak to the doctors and they're like we don't see any any reason why you shouldn't be able to have children and they would just keep saying it's just unexplained infertility uh would be the term that they would use and that's not always easy to to receive you don't you when you go to the doctor you're you're hoping and expecting that they're going to give you a reason and you're looking for answers and looking for answers and looking for for what can I do to change change it and they never could give us um a reason and they just every time it would be unexplained unexplained and so we we talked um between the two of us and along with uh one of my aunts who had adopted um went through the adoption process because she had been told that she would never be able to have children and so she had become a foster parent and then adopted and then shortly after she adopted about a year later and at that time she was 40 um she became pregnant oh wow on on her own after clinically they said that there was no way well that she could have a child and so she became pregnant and um and carried you know she has now she has a son that she adopted and a daughter U that was natural born so we we talked about the um possibility of becoming foster parents and and looked into adopting and um every time that we would go and contact the local DSS office the the dates that they would have for the classes always fell um at least one of the dates each week fell on our church night for our week night service and I not told Heather I said I just don't feel that that is God's leading for me to Mis Church mhm sure to go to become a foster parent I believe if he if that is his true uh if that's going to be an Avenue that he uses for us I believe he will he will open it up and not cause me to miss church just to try to force and push that because to me I felt like that would be me really trying to make something happen when maybe God was putting his hand on it and saying that's not my direction that I want you to go right now so we had tried um for about a year year and a half or so we would contact them each time the knights was going to be on a uh our church night so um in the year 2008 um we had seen a um um a little live play where bunch of the kids and adults and acting out a play um and it was called The Box c car children and in that that play um it was talking about um like your kids without homes and such and we we when we both left from that we both were very emotional um it was supposed to be you know fun and everything I used to listen to the like CDs of it right so when we left we became very emotional and I was like I really want to I really want to have that I want to have I want to help take care of children that for whatever reason they're not able to be with their biological uh parents um for whatever reason and so we talked more about it we were coming into the January of 2009 and I told her I said well why don't you just call one more time and see maybe something you know maybe they have another class that's coming up and maybe we can even then I had gotten to the point that I said it's only going to be maybe a few you know a few church services that we have to miss over the next few months let me we'll think about it I I'd got to that that point so we she contacted um she called the local DSS office and they said well actually in two weeks we have um another class that's getting ready to start and always the next question is going to be or do you have space available and what nights is it and they said well actually this time we've changed our meetings our classes are going to be on a Monday night and a Thursday night well and we're like well that's perfect cuz we at that time our church had Church on Tuesday nights and most other churches in our area had churches on Wednesday nights so they they wouldn't have the classes on Wednesday night because they knew that that would conflict but they would usually have it on Tuesday and Thursday so this time they said we're going to have it on Monday and Thursday and she said well how do you have any spots available they said we have two spots left in the class and and she immediately she said please put our name on that so we started we went for our first they called it map classes um to become certified for become foster parents the starting date for our classes was January the 26th of 2009 we went through the classes during the classes about 6 weeks into it the came to us and had a uh a photograph of a little boy a little little baby boy um that um was born with clef lip and cleft pallet and they said um you know we have this little little boy that um is going to be needing a forever home and would you guys be interested and bringing him into your home knowing that he has this condition and the two hea or not both looked at each other and we're like the condition doesn't matter yeah it doesn't matter that that there may have you know something with cleft pallet all the all that can be that can be fixed and can be worked with and we even both said to each other if we had a child born yeah with that we're not going to cast them aside just because just because they had that so we said yes we would love to have him in our home if it can work out that way so several months went by beyond that I really didn't hear anything from them till after we had completed the classes and um I guess we were maybe about 6 months um from the from the date that we had started and then they come to us and they said uh we are going to have to move um Jaden his name was Jaden we have to move Jaden from the home he in and he needs to be placed into a permanent forever home are you guys still available and we said yes so at about seven or eight months um Jaden was brought into our home and and I I loved how you explain what is the name because that was the name that was given to him what do his name is Jaden means Jehovah has heard wow and that was the name that was that was the name that was given to him by his birth par well we didn't we didn't choose it it was already chosen for him and it it was so fitting when we when I heard that his name was Jaden I'm like yes Jehovah has hurt yeah he heard our cry he heard our prayer and answered it because we had such a love and a desire to have children in our home and he other things were delayed in order for him to be placed into our home well as the transfer was taking place they have documents and things that they they bring and they go over things with you things like their birth date and um when they told us his birth date that is he was actually born on January the 26th of 2009 the very day that we began our classes to become foster parents it just it blew me away yeah everything lining up that and that that was not a coincidence yeah for sure for him to have been born the very same day that we started and um it just it it just amazes me how how God works and how he moves and um but we still you know we we still even though we were bring we brought him in to our home he was the third foster child thinking about that but I might should have asked as Heather I believe it's the third foster child uh that was in our home um we ultimately we did foster care for nine oh wow I did not know yeah total of nine children wow and out of the nine children that we did foster care for we adopted two um Jaden be our being our first that we adopted and then uh samanah being our second that we adopted and uh Savannah came to us she was um she was only 4 days old um we actually went to the hospital and brought her home from the hospital um 4 days old and uh she had a lot of uh difficulties within her body um due to um things that the the biological mom had had done um while she was pregnant and um so there was some conditions that we had to to work with um but she's you know Savannah now is almost 13 13 years old Jaden just turned 15 years old and we were thinking that um you know God had really blessed us and he did he he blessed us beyond what I could have imagined at that time um by allowing us to have the children in our home but in in our conversations and in our thoughts and in our prayers we Heather and I both felt that there was more that we were had been given promises throughout our our marriage through different ministers at different times and different locations that that God was going to give us a biological child he was going to give us children and um it it became at first it was it was easy to kind of push that aside once you had children in your home that come through the um the Avenue of adoption you kind of maybe didn't dwell on that as much but then different things would would happen and and your mind would go back to that again and you're thinking well why has that not happened yet you you still wanted to know why am I still traveling down a journey of infertility yeah you know when everybody else not everybody but so many around you become so easy to to have a child and why are we struggling with it so much and it wasn't until uh 2019 that we were at a u a church service um our camp meeting our church there in Ruth North Carolina Bible Tabernacle um we we've hosted a missionary camp meeting for many years it's it started the year after I was born so this year will be the 51st wow year that's coming up um during before 2019 there had been many times that different ministers had spoken to me um asking me if I felt that maybe God was calling me to the ministry and each time the they would say that I would give a resounding no and I emphatic tell them no he is not he is he's called me to the music Ministry because music was what I loved and that was what I felt comfortable doing and I Knew by watching the lives of other friends of mine who were ministers I knew that the life of a minister required commitment it required a lot of their time and I was selfish quite honest I was I was selfish with my time and um I was running a business or trying to learn how to run a business um and I just felt like that was not what I wanted to I didn't want to do it um I didn't want to yield over my time um to God and um so that went on multiple times through throughout my life even prior to me um meeting Heather I'd had people ask me that and I had felt inwardly each time that they would that they would ask me that question and I would give that response there I could hear the voice inside of me saying that's wrong you know and I could feel it was it was was like I was I was hurting the spirit within me every time I would say that because it was contradictory to what I knew was correct in me and um so in 2019 at at the missionary camp meeting there was a speaker that that spoke that that night and um after after he spoke he was having he was receiving some Kickback as he was ministering he even mentioned it during the uh the service and he had made a comment that you know if maybe if the Lord can't work out here you know he could work behind the curtain well we were in a um a place called the foundation um and so they have large curtains um off to the sides and after his ministry that evening he had moved off um the platform and different individuals um had come come to him and was um being prayed for and he was ministering to them through prayer and given Direction and given you know some some direct things from the Lord to those couples some were couples and some were individuals that he was speaking with and I was just kind of waiting patiently because it kind of crowded the the exit door I was just tring to hold back I was going to wait till I could get out and go find Heather well I didn't know that she was making her way down a side hallway back to the platform because I'd been back there for a while and and she wanted to to to greet the minister as well and so as he moved out into the hallway and he he saw her his he he saw Heather walking and he said where's your husband well I was behind him he didn't know where that I was back kind of in the shadows area didn't realize I was back there he said where's your husband and I heard him say that and so my immediate assumption was he's going to pray with us as a couple um about our desire to have children um cuz so many people knew yeah you know for years and years and years um have seen um seen us talk about our desire for for children so I I just felt that that's what he was going to do so I got over next to Heather and and he got closer to us and then he called my pastor he looked to to behind him and said you might want to come over here for this I found that a little odd you know I'm like well maybe he just going to bind Faith together and um more people pray and I was that's what I was ready for I was ready to enter in and let them pray that we're going to have children because I've went through that I've heard that prayer so many times throughout the years we didn't look at Heather he looked straight in my eyes and it was as though he's looking straight through me and took his hand and touched my chest and said until you fully surrender to what God has called you to do God cannot fully bless you and it was at that moment that I recognized that it was my fault it was my decisions that I had made that was delaying what God was wanting to do and I realized that I had to yield I had no other way to any other anything else that I could do but fully yield and I I I I I didn't go down to the floor but I was I got so so weak that they caught me and uh because I I recognized immediately I knew what the Lord was telling me and I knew that he was it was coming down to a a decision that I had to either say yes Lord I'm going to yield to what you've called me to do I've been running from it for 17 at that time 17 years I had pushed it aside and I knew that God had called me to the ministry he had showed me so many times that he had but I was resisting it I did not want to yield to it and I I I'm embarrassed to say that you know as as a minister now to sit here and say that that I stood in God's way for so many years he was there the entire time trying his best to pour out his blessings on me and because of my ignorance I'll put it that way um my stubbornness um I would not yield to it and um you know I I I can't go back and change those things I I look at it and and I recognize that that through all of those things God still had an expected end when you look at Jeremiah 29:11 he still had an expected end and he brought me to that expected end even though I moved and and got out of his got got in his way and got out of line of where I really should have been other blessings could have been maybe brought on sooner but then also Jaden and Savannah most likely would have not have been brought into our home or it would would have been done through a different avenue it would not have happened in the the way that it happened if I would have yielded to that 17 years ago um and which would have been even before me meeting Heather um and so in all of that even with with my stubbornness God God looked beyond that and he had a plan that was going to come to fruition and it has and so we you I I I yielded to the to the the call of ministry and um was absolutely scared to death um I had some brothers uh reach out to me um shortly after they heard that I had U that had yielded to the call um when the first one sent sent me a text I was in my truck and got got the text come across my phone asking if I would come and Minister for him and I literally got sick I sat in the truck and and got got sick I felt like my face was just flushed um because it it just it just hit me so hard that it was really really happening and and that you know I had to answer I had to answer that call and and I I could no longer sit on my hands and and refuse to do what God wanted me to do because I knew at that moment if I refuse to do that anymore there's no telling what what suffering that I might have to go through um if I didn't yield especially whenever he came in such a strong way to speak to me so um I I started ministering um late 2019 and um Heather and I still you know still going forward then I felt renewed I I my my um I felt renewed with expecting um that we're going to have a child we're going to have a biological child of our own because I I started then I started looking I was like well Lord I'm I'm you know I'm doing what I supposed to do now you can bless me yeah and that's not the way God always works just because you know we can't we can't put him in a box and say okay there's a if I you know I've done this now now you've got to come and and and show me that that you're going to honor it you know we we can't direct him and we can't dictate to him sure what his timing is his promise is still going to be fulfilled but I can't dictate to him when it's going to happen so we uh um we we went on and and looking and anticipating that um any you know any month that we're going to get a a test result it's going to say that that Heather's pregnant and it went on for month after month after month again and you're over over a year again and then that that devil of discouragement starts popping in your head and starts telling you see all that was just you know that was just in your head none of that really mattered and it started trying to play those those things through your mind and you had to push that back every single time and say no that's not correct it's when God when God wants to do it he's going to do it but in my mind in my my natural thinking I'm thinking I'm getting older you know my my wife's getting older and uh I wasn't getting to Abraham's age um but I we we we were we getting uh getting older and um there was a a a thing that started happening um I I started noticing that um I'd lay down at at to to bed in the evening and night after night I would see the number 1111 on my clock it was 1111 it got to the point that I was start taking snapshots of it I'd be sitting at work and happen to look down at my phone and I'd pull my phone out and it'd say 11-11 and I'd screenshot it and I'd send it to Heather I said I don't understand what is going on why why do I keep seeing 1111 all the time and um we went went on and on and it it went on for um a couple of months and she started seeing 11-11 on that it just seemed like different things we were going down the highway um had visited some friends and was coming back and come to an intersection I looked over and there was a sign that said 11-11 um on at the gas station and I don't even know what the sign was about but it had 1111 on it and I kept remarking to her I said there's something I don't I don't know why I keep seeing that but there has to be a reason I keep seeing it and um it was during the time um that uh a lot of covid restrictions was going on that uh we couldn't be in church um having live services so brother Joe um was ministering and we were at home live streaming for some of the services and he started I believe it I think it was one of those services or I might have been in service with him I can't remember remember exactly but he he was ministering and he said let's turn to to uh to Hebrews 111 I remember that Heather wasn't in the in the service that that night for some reason I think she was um visiting her family in Georgia and he said let's turn to Hebrews 11:11 and as soon as he said Hebrews my mind was flooded something's getting ready to be spoken to me yeah because that's all I've seen for the last 2 months is the number 1111 and in Hebrews 11:11 we we see where it says that it was by faith that Sarah received strength to receive seed and because at the end of that scripture it says because she judged him own faithful who promised yeah and it was it was so strong WR that it that it hit me at that moment that we have to judge him faithful we have to accept that he is faithful the one who gives us the promise is faithful to perform the promise and we can't let the things that we see distract us and the things that that that is that we that we see with our own eyes distract us from that but we have to recognize and judge him faithful that's what he that's what Sarah did she justed him faithful she said the one who gave me the promise will keep the promise and we move forward from that and shortly shortly after that received a um uh an individual that came to me and said um have you guys thought about uh trying IVF um again because we had tried IVF uh we had actually done one series of IVF and two series of IUI and all of which were unsuccessful and when the person mentioned that to me I said that's very expensive um it's $20,000 um or better to uh to do an IVF procedure and they said well just know if the two of you chose to um to try that route one more time that the money has been set aside and it's covered 100% And so I was just blown away um I didn't say anything to to Heather about that um I just kept it to myself and um a few days later uh about three or three or four days later um she had gotten a a message from a a friend uh from down in Jamaica sister Francine Reed had sent her a um a message that was about a uh a couple in in Florida who had went through an IVF um procedure and was successful and they had been married for 16 years and there were and it it so matched our situation it got us talking about it and she said look the even the the name name of the hospital that they went to um was the same name of the hospital that we would be going to in our area and um so we after we we talked about it for a few minutes I said well let me share this with you um and I and I went went with went over with her what the person had told me and she just her eyes got big and and U we just said there and and talked about it for a while and um prayed about it and we didn't didn't make a hasty decision but we we decided we would go through that and try that so we we did the um the IVF procedure and um out of don't want to go through all the details details of it because it gets lengthy but um out of it we um we were blessed with uh three healthy embryos um out of the three embryos we were able to use one and um during the uh they call it a Embryo transfer and as it's when they they place the embryo um inside the in inside Heather they they during the procedure the doctor comes in and uh she says says now um you'll know when the implantation uh procedure is complete because you'll see she had a screen up pulled up there for us to watch she said you'll see a burst of light appear on the screen and you'll know that the implantation transfer has been or the transfer of the embryo is complete and when she said you're you're going to see a burst of light show up on that screen I I look at her and I said you do not know what you just said I said because that's exactly what's happening Life Light is being planted and placed and that light is going to grow and that light did grow and that light is Liam and he is he's our firstborn um natural um child biological child and um we were just ecstatic that God had allowed through even through medicine um in medical science to assist and to to something that we had was getting to a place that we really wondered you was it ever going to take place even though we we you want to believe and you you you keep trying to believe with all the faith that you can that that it is going to happen but the longer the delay many times it's it's easy for you to um to start questioning things but we we witnessed it we watched it and and Little Liam was was born and just a bundle of joy and we were so ecstatic and just so thrilled and and you we we have our promise of God that that um is now in in our arms and we can physically hold this miracle and about 9 months that after he he was about 9 months old and I come home from work one day and um I was outside of the house and it was a Wednesday evening and I was just taking care of a couple things that I needed to do outside before getting ready for church and all of a sudden I hear the door open and Heather screaming coming out of the house and I'm like what has happened well is is Liam okay is you know what's what's happened that's my my first thought is something is wrong and she comes running out of the house and she's carrying a u pregnancy test and she said I'm pregnant and I said say what and and and at first I literally told her I said why I said why are you why are you joking about I said this is not something to joke about I said that's one of the old pregnancy test back whenever you were checking about Liam and she said no I just took this pregnancy test right now and I said seriously and she said yes and uh so we're like didn't know what to think did not know what to think so of course we you know go and go to the doctors and and let them uh do some checks and everything and they're like you most certainly are pregnant and you're going to have we you know later find out we're going to have a little girl and um so now we have we have Mila and um it just it it showed me for for me and this is the way I look at it it it showed me that God not only works through medicine but even when things seem hopeless and you feel like you have you have tried every Avenue that you can do that if we truly trust and we truly believe and truly have faith in what he said that he would do that he will come and perform it um and in a time that we thought there was absolutely medical science had told us there's no way and if you ever since she had we had Leo they said if you ever want to go have another pregnancy you'll have to come back to us and do it this way again and then God stepped him and said you've trusted me you've you've you've yielded you've trusted you've watched what what I've done even through the Avenue of medicine but now let me show you what my fullness is the fullness of his power the true power of God when he can come down and take a a wound that was unable to to have a child and to Bear a child and he says I can make it do that I can place seed there and I can let her have a child when it's all natural no anybody that had any doubts of like Oh well man still had to help like God just stepped in and said all right let let me share you now exactly and we had even had um we had had people say that when we would we would give testimony about Liam and and how he came and and how God moved and they said well yeah but you still went to the doctors and the doctors did this and they did that and they did the other and you know so they kind of they they kind of wanted to lessen the miracle the miracle they is still 100% a miracle he is 100% a miracle but then God said I just believe he he said okay I want to take away any doubt yeah I want to take away any chance that somebody could take the testimony from you and I'm going to give you another child and I'm going to give you a child in such a way that nobody can ever question amen even to the point of as she was growing they did an ultrasound and told us she only has a two vessel umbilical C which you're supposed to have a three vessel many children are are able to be born uh without complication with only a two vessel but there are others that if they have a two vessel it's indicator that um that there may be some other things wrong there may be some deformities and such and so they started telling us that which first thing Satan wants to do is that yeah yeah I'm I'm going to squelch that testimony I'm going to I'm going to do something that's damaging to her and we we left out of that um appointment and went to church I think the either that day or the next day went to church and presented the need before the the congregation and we told them what they had told us that she only has two vessel cord and it could be an indicator of down syndrome or some different different things and I remember standing there before the church and I said I said the that I serve that has cre given us this creation is able to keep her throughout the pregnancy to go to full term even with a two vessel cord and she would just be she'll be just fine I said but he's also able to create another vessel in that cord and give her a three vessel cord when they say she has a two vessel and we have the the prince where they did the ultrasound and the prince showed two vessel cord so due to her having that or they they the two vessel cord they said we want you to go to a a Target Anatomy scan which was almost two weeks later and we want you to go for that uh so they can check to see if she has indicators for um abnormalities and and what they would refer to as defects deficiencies and we said well we'll we'll go to it and I even I told him I said we'll go to it but we're going to go to that appointment and we're going to let doctors testify before we ever got there I said that from the from to the church we're going to let the doctors testify what God can do so we get to the appointment and they start doing all of the scans and I'm listening to the sonographer as she's you know checking her head checking her hands checking her feet check you know all the all the body parts she's going through checking everything and and and she she said that looks good that looks good that looks good and then she she's just talking along and she says now your chart says that the reason why you guys are here today is because she has a two vessel core and we're said that's that's right that's why we had to come she said well she doesn't have a two vessel cord she has a three vessel cord and she said let me show you and she pulled it up on the screen and she showed us multiple places throughout where she had a three vessel cord and uh and I saidwell that's that's just wonderful I said because that's what we said that God was going to be able to do and she just kind of looked at us you know and then you she didn't really go on about it and she said well maybe that they maybe they you know they messed up I said no they didn't mess up I've got pictures where it clearly shows the two vessel and now she has a three vessel and um so again it was just God's confirmation um to us of of his miracul power in what he can do when we just trust in him um and I know that sounds like maybe to something that sounds like a a cliche um that all you have to do is trust in God well that's literally yeah all you have to do for sure is trust in him because he he is not going to fail his word can never fail absolutely Canada that mine can but his can't and uh going back just a little bit to when uh that brother spoke that over that Minister spoke that to you about fully surrender and I actually shared with this with you at the house before he came because I had never gotten a chance to but when you first came here and shared that and I mean you can ask Dad cuz I told him about it when you first came here and shared that about you know your blessings won't come until you fully surrender that's stuck with me I mean absolutely insane I I there's something that I I think of every day of my life now wow because it meant so much to me and like I told you I may I may not remember another word you said that whole weekend I'm just being honest sure but that one thing I I will live the rest of my life and by by that because as soon as I heard that it still took me some time to fully understand what I needed to do but as soon as I started fully surrendering and understanding what I needed to do and I'm I'm sure I'm not all the way there but you know I'm getting there but as soon as I started doing that everything promises started coming back blessings I mean this is really one of the reasons why this podcast started because the Lord laid this in my in my heart the Lord for that from heing that and you know that is like I said I'm so grateful that I was able to hear that and and if it if it didn't help anybody else in this world it 100% helped me and you know I could never be you know more grateful for that that's that's that's awesome um I don't I don't even know what what what to say but I I'm I'm I'm thankful that um that being me being able to share something like that uh from my life would be able to um to help somebody else yes sir and um and that's my whole whole reason for um accepting your invitation today is is just to um to pray and and hope that um something that as said can uh can uplift someone else and and and encourage be an encouragement to them and um again if like if if they don't hear anything else that understand that yeah that many times we're the ones that's delaying the blessings that that God is trying to pour out upon us and if we can ever truly get to the place that we fully yield and fully surrender our Liv life to him we would be absolutely amazed for sure with the Miracles that God will perform and what he wants to do through each one of our Lives um and quck kind of off to it but how did uh I know we talked about this a little bit at the house how did you uh become acquainted with Dad and the ministry here and and stuff like that I became acquainted uh with Brother Steve um as in my in early ear days as he would come through um our church and he he ministered for us um he I remember him so so much because again I love music I love singing and he had such a powerful anointing um upon his music Ministry when he would come through and and sing and our pastor um loved to hear him sing and he would have him uh he would have him play the piano and and sing for us and and um it was such a blessing and and that's how I became um acquainted with him and knew him but we weren't um we weren't like buddies or friends per se but I I knew of him I knew of his his ministry I can um I can even remember one of the uh the first messages that I heard him preach um and I can't remember how far back that is now um that's been a long time ago I guess it have been maybe in the early 90s or late ' 80s I'm not exactly sure but some sometime around there and and he he preached a message one more night with the frogs and um it was a it was a message that stuck with me um but I I just I loved his um I loved his the spirit that was with him the spirit about him and whenever he would sing and preach the anointing was there and um I I was just I I I loved it I I I love I love anointed singing Love anointed preaching and uh it really blessed my my life and um we really became um more of a bond due to a um um a vehicle breaking down and he C he came to my rescue uh we were traveling back from a vacation um and was coming through the area and our van was having severe issues and uh so we ended up having a stop in opala and they were going to have to work on the van we didn't know how long it was going to take Heather started reaching out trying to you know see who was in the area that we knew and um she reached out to your mom and uh so they said said sure we'll we'll come and um you let us know what hotel you're at and we'll come pick you up they came and picked us up at the hotel um took us to get us something to to eat and while our van was U being worked on for the next day or so um and it just really created a created a friendship and a bond um what some people you know what Satan tries to to use sometimes to to bring you down um is simp uh bringing you to where God wants you to be and meet the people that God wants you to meet and ever since then uh we just had a a a close camaraderie um he I expressed to him um that the L that the Lord had called me um to the ministry and and that I yielded to it and then he was so gracious to invite me um several times now to come down and and speak and be a part um the the meetings that's been going on and that we've been able to come down a few times uh for other meetings that I didn't have to to to speak and just it just come and enjoy and and participate in the fellowship and uh it's been such a joy it just has been such a joy amazing happened out here it really has oh do you I like to ask everybody this and I told you I was uh if you could give any advice to the young people of this generation especially the young people growing up in the message of this generation what what would it be yield yeah that's that's the yeah that's first word that comes to my my mind is um yield and yield soon um surrender to God's calling um as soon as as soon as he starts calling don't delay yeah um open up to him right then and give him everything that you've got and you will not regret it that that's the best advice that I think I could give is is yield and yield quick because it's sad especially like nowadays seeing so many people you know leaving church and stuff like that and I mean it's you know before they know it it's going to be too late and sure you know that's so sad to see and hard to watch hey know as a young person you know some of these are my friends and it's like and if you just only like if you only you could realize what's what's about to happen like exactly and I don't I don't um I don't know where they go to whenever you when you when you walk away from God and you walk away from truth I don't know where they go to but if they could if they could ever grasp the need for surrendering to him um it would change their life yeah forever for sure change it completely yes sir it's been amazing it's that's absolutely been amazing to hear this and I'm so grateful that you were willing to come on here and H this with me so thankful for the invitation yes sir such a such a blessing would you mind praying before we side off yeah love to Heavenly Father Lord we have felt your presence here among us today
