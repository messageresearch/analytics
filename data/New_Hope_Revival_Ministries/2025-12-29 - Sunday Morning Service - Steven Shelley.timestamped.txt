[32:15] burn it all. If I feel your heart, but
[32:18] [music] I never see your hand. Oh, I
[32:22] still have it all. Cuz [music] no
[32:25] treasure [singing] of this life it could
[32:29] ever satisfy. [music] God, you are
[32:33] [singing] my everything.
[32:38] Oh God, you are my everything.
[32:45] Oh my God, you are my everything.
[32:55] And what a god. What a god.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; What a god you are.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; What a god. What a god.
[33:11] &gt;&gt; And what a god. What a god.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; There's none like you. What a god. What
[33:21] a god.
[33:26] So if you listen to [singing]
[33:28] our hearts
[33:34] and hear our spirit sing
[33:42] the song of praise [singing]
[33:43] that flows
[33:49] for those you have redeemed.
[33:57] And we will use the words we know
[34:02] to tell you what an awesome
[34:08] [music] God
[34:09] you are.
[34:11] But when [singing] words are not enough,
[34:15] Lord, just to tell you of our love,
[34:19] won't you [music] listen to our hearts?
[34:27] If words could fall rain
[34:35] from [music] these [singing] lips of
[34:37] mine.
[34:42] And if I had a thousand years, [music]
[34:48] Lord, I [singing] would still run out
[34:51] [music] of time.
[34:56] So if [music] you listen to my heart,
[35:04] oh Lord, [singing] every beat will say,
[35:11] "Oh, thank you [music and singing] for
[35:13] the life. Oh, and thank you for this
[35:17] truth, and thank you [music] for the
[35:21] way.
[35:26] So [music and singing] listen to our
[35:29] hearts.
[35:33] Won't [music] you hear our spirit sing?
[35:41] It's a song of praise that flows.
[35:48] Oh, from those you [music] have
[35:50] redeemed. You've redeemed us, Lord.
[35:55] So [music and singing] we will use the
[35:58] words we know to tell you what an
[36:05] awesome
[36:06] God [music]
[36:08] you are.
[36:10] The words are not enough
[36:14] to tell [singing and music] you of our
[36:16] love.
[36:18] Listen to our Bring the music down. I
[36:21] want to hear you sing it this morning.
[36:25] So listen to our hearts
[36:33] and hear our spirit sing.
[36:40] A song of praise that flows
[36:48] from those you have [singing] redeemed.
[36:55] And we will use the words we know to
[37:01] tell [singing and music]
[37:02] you what it all.
[37:11] When words are not enough, Lord, just to
[37:15] tell you of our love,
[37:19] I'll listen to our Sing it like that
[37:22] again. So listen,
[37:26] so listen to our hearts
[37:31] [screaming]
[37:33] and hear our spirit sing.
[37:40] A song of praise that flows
[37:48] from those you have [singing] redeemed.
[37:56] And we will use the words [singing] we
[37:59] know to tell
[38:03] you what an awesome [music]
[38:07] God that you are.
[38:10] But when words are not enough
[38:13] [music and singing]
[38:14] to tell you of our love,
[38:19] listen to our heart. when words are not
[38:24] enough.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; But when [singing] words are not enough,
[38:30] Lord, to tell you of our [singing] love,
[38:34] just listen to our hearts.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; I will sing of the mercies of the Lord
[38:47] forever.
[38:49] With my mouth I will make known thy
[38:53] faithfulness
[38:54] &gt;&gt; to all generations.
[38:57] For I have said, "Mercy shall be built
[39:00] up forever. Thy faithfulness shalt thou
[39:03] established in the very heavens, and the
[39:06] heavens shall praise thy wonders, O
[39:08] Lord. Thy faithfulness also in the
[39:11] congregation of the saints. For who in
[39:14] the heaven can be compared unto the
[39:17] Lord? Who among the sons of the mighty
[39:20] can be likened unto the Lord? God is
[39:24] greatly to be feared in the assembly of
[39:26] the saints, and to be had in reverence
[39:29] of all them that are about him. Oh Lord,
[39:32] God of hosts, who is a strong Lord like
[39:36] unto thee? Or to thy faithfulness round
[39:39] about thee? Thou rulest the raging of
[39:43] the sea. When the waves thereof arise,
[39:46] thou stilllest them.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; Thou hast broken Egypt in pieces, as one
[39:52] that is slain. Thou hast scattered thine
[39:55] enemies with thy strong arm. The heavens
[39:58] are thine, the earth, the earth also is
[40:01] thine. As for the world, and the
[40:04] fullness thereof, thou hast founded
[40:06] them. The north and the south thou hast
[40:10] created them. Tabler and her Hermmon
[40:13] shall rejoice in thy name. Thou hast a
[40:16] mighty arm. Strong is thy hand and high
[40:20] is thy right hand. JUSTICE AND JUDGMENT
[40:23] are the habitation of thy throne. Mercy
[40:27] and truth shall go before thy face.
[40:30] Blessed is the people that know the
[40:33] joyful sound. They shall walk, O Lord,
[40:36] in the light of thy countenance. In thy
[40:40] name they shall rejoice all the day. And
[40:43] in thy righteousness shall they be
[40:46] exalted. For thou art the glory of their
[40:50] strength. And in thy favor our horn
[40:53] shall be exalted. For the Lord is our
[40:57] defense and the Holy One of Israel is
[41:01] our King. Hallelujah.
[41:04] Lord, we give you praise today.
[41:08] Lord, [screaming] we give you praise
[41:10] today. [music]
[41:13] Great is thy faithfulness, oh Lord.
[41:17] Great is thy faithfulness in all the
[41:19] earth.
[41:21] Hallelujah.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Lord, we praise you.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:29] Glory to the name of the Lord.
[41:35] He is more than enough.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; As we approach him in prayer, do you
[41:40] have a need you just like to lift your
[41:41] hand? Say, "Lord, I have a need I need
[41:45] you to meet." He is well able to do it.
[41:49] Would you remember my father-in-law to
[41:51] the Lord? [clears throat] At 90 years of
[41:53] age, he struggles getting up out of a
[41:56] chair to walk 20 feet [music] before
[41:59] he's he's exhausted. And it seems that
[42:03] his time is very near. We don't really
[42:06] know, but God does. We don't want him to
[42:09] suffer. And I know God is a healer.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; Luke and his family are in need of the
[42:15] Lord today. The children are still
[42:18] fighting sicknesses, this stuff that
[42:20] keeps going around, but God is still our
[42:23] healer.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful for that.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Would you remember Sister Flo to the
[42:29] Lord? She wasn't well yesterday, but she
[42:32] wanted to show up for Jesse, and she
[42:35] needs our prayers today for strength and
[42:38] to get through what she's going through.
[42:41] Benjamin and Jenna and Elelliana are
[42:44] leaving this afternoon for Washington
[42:46] State, and we want to ask the Lord to
[42:49] give them traveling mercies, grace, and
[42:52] protection, and there are many others
[42:53] who are yet to travel home. Yes.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; We want the Lord to let angels line the
[42:58] highways
[43:00] &gt;&gt; and take them safe,
[43:01] &gt;&gt; right?
[43:01] &gt;&gt; And if you run out of things to pray
[43:03] for, pray for Pap and Nana,
[43:06] &gt;&gt; cuz [snorts] we're going to have a rough
[43:07] 10 days without our baby girl.
[43:10] [laughter]
[43:12] God,
[43:13] &gt;&gt; I don't even remember life before
[43:15] [snorts] her.
[43:25] to you out across that camera.
[43:28] We may not know your name. We may not
[43:31] know your location,
[43:33] your sickness, the trouble you're going
[43:35] through.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; But our Lord, he does.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; He knows your name. He knows the hairs
[43:42] of your head. He knows the trouble you
[43:45] face. And he knows how to meet that
[43:47] need.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; And we remember you as we go to prayer
[43:50] today. sing this old chorus as we're
[43:53] getting ready to pray.
[43:56] Thank you, Lord. Sweep over
[44:01] my [singing and music] soul.
[44:04] Sweep over
[44:07] my soul.
[44:10] Sweet spirit,
[44:14] sweep over
[44:16] my soul. [music]
[44:19] Oh,
[44:22] my [singing] rest
[44:25] is [music]
[44:25] complete
[44:28] while I sit [singing]
[44:30] at your feet. [music]
[44:33] Sweet spirit,
[44:36] sweep over
[44:39] my soul. Brother Hawk, will you come and
[44:43] pray today, [music] please?
[44:45] Sweep over
[44:47] [singing] my [music]
[44:48] soul.
[44:51] Sweep over
[44:54] my soul.
[44:57] Sweet spirit.
[45:00] Sweep over [singing]
[45:03] my soul.
[45:05] [music]
[45:08] My rest
[45:11] is [singing] complete.
[45:13] [music]
[45:14] While I sit
[45:16] at your feet,
[45:19] sweet spirit, [singing and music]
[45:23] sweet,
[45:34] &gt;&gt; heavenly father,
[45:38] we're coming together in this moment to
[45:42] honor you.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. [music]
[45:44] &gt;&gt; And to bless you because you are worthy.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; We're gathered in this place.
[45:55] We come from many directions and many
[45:58] backgrounds,
[46:00] &gt;&gt; but you have been faithful and you
[46:02] revealed yourself to us
[46:05] &gt;&gt; and we're so thankful for redemption.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[46:09] Even before we were born, we were
[46:12] chosen.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; In the Lord Jesus Christ
[46:17] &gt;&gt; for redemption, for eternity to be a
[46:21] part of you. I'm so thankful for this
[46:24] time
[46:26] &gt;&gt; of redemption because I'm gonna carry
[46:28] that all the way into eternity and I'm
[46:32] going to remember your faithfulness and
[46:35] your love to lay down your life for me
[46:39] &gt;&gt; for sure
[46:40] &gt;&gt; because you love me.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; I'm a simple creature. I just want to
[46:45] know that I have a dad, a heavenly
[46:48] father
[46:50] &gt;&gt; that loves me and cares for me
[46:53] &gt;&gt; and that is leading me along because he
[46:56] has a plan. And I thank you also today
[46:59] that you have made provision for
[47:02] everything in our lives. Some need
[47:05] healing in their bodies.
[47:08] But through that atonement
[47:10] laying down of your life that precious
[47:12] price of your blood, it is already done.
[47:16] So we just speak healing into everybody
[47:19] that is needing healing right now in the
[47:22] name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; We lift Sister Joseph's dad,
[47:28] &gt;&gt; her father to you, Lord. You know his
[47:30] life, every days of his life was in are
[47:33] in your hands. But we just pray comfort,
[47:36] strength, and peace to him and all their
[47:38] families
[47:42] &gt;&gt; for all the children that are fighting
[47:44] sickness. Everyone that is fighting
[47:46] sickness in this room,
[47:49] we just speak to the symptoms of
[47:52] sickness to leave in the authority of
[47:55] Jesus Christ. But Father, most of all,
[47:58] today in this moment, may your perfect
[48:01] plan unfold. Would you speak to us?
[48:04] Would you do something for our lives?
[48:09] &gt;&gt; There are things in our lives that we
[48:11] have tried so hard to fix or change. But
[48:15] we invite
[48:17] &gt;&gt; you to come into our lives. We say yes
[48:19] and we surrender.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; Would you come and and do for us [music]
[48:24] that we can't do for ourselves?
[48:26] &gt;&gt; That is who you are. We're dependent on
[48:29] you and your ability and your spirit in
[48:33] our lives. And we just commit everything
[48:36] that we are, our whole being
[48:39] &gt;&gt; to you right now
[48:41] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, we praise you Lord.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; God bless you as you have your seat
[48:56] today.
[49:01] What a wonderful crowd in the house of
[49:04] the Lord today. We honor you. We thank
[49:09] you for being here. And if I start
[49:12] calling names, I'm sure to not know one
[49:14] of you
[49:16] or two of you or three of you. But all
[49:19] of our friends from the Indiana
[49:22] Fellowship, we're glad that you're here.
[49:24] You came down for the wedding. We're
[49:25] glad that you stayed and may the Lord
[49:28] bless you.
[49:30] [applause]
[49:34] The Hefernon family came in this as uh
[49:37] Cad's mom and dad and brother and
[49:40] sister. We're glad that they're here in
[49:41] the service today.
[49:44] [applause]
[49:48] Some of Sister Martha's family still
[49:51] here or traveled back, I understand, to
[49:53] be in the service today. We bless you
[49:56] and honor you for that and are glad that
[49:58] you're in the house of the Lord with us.
[50:01] [applause]
[50:04] I know that we have a representation
[50:06] from Wyoming sitting here in the back.
[50:08] We're glad that you stayed over to be in
[50:10] the service today, came for the wedding.
[50:12] We're glad that you're here.
[50:18] And then we have the newlyweds that came
[50:20] today. Jesse and Roa, brother and sister
[50:24] Washington, we're glad that you're in
[50:26] the service today. God bless you.
[50:30] [applause]
[50:35] &gt;&gt; It says a lot.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; It does. Yeah.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; It says a lot that they're here today.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; It does. It does.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; I admire them. I do. I respect them very
[50:43] much. Amen.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; For making the Lord Lord today.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Yes. I know we have Missouri represented
[50:51] here. We have Texas represented here.
[50:54] What other states? Alabama,
[50:57] Indiana, we've already mentioned.
[51:00] Is that all?
[51:01] &gt;&gt; And a real a realist
[51:04] cousin uh on on Sister Teresa's side,
[51:08] Austin, is here.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Austin, you let's see. I think you're in
[51:12] Missouri, too, right? And Lily and
[51:15] Aaliyah from Missouri.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; We're glad that all of you are here.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; We're glad that Jesus is here.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; If he's not here, what's the worth in
[51:24] coming?
[51:25] &gt;&gt; But I'm glad that whether I'm here,
[51:27] whether I'm at home or I'm traveling
[51:29] down the road, he's with me
[51:30] &gt;&gt; because he lives inside of me.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Brother Kate is going to
[51:37] uh he's going to continue to lead us in
[51:39] worship to the preaching of the word.
[51:41] We're getting our hearts ready for that.
[51:43] Uh continuing to get our hearts ready.
[51:45] If you waited till you got here to ask
[51:47] the Lord to speak to you, that was
[51:49] probably a little too long to wait. We
[51:52] should be asking the Lord to speak to us
[51:54] before we ever get here. But we're glad
[51:57] that he answers our prayer and and he
[51:59] can show up in a moment's time. I'm
[52:02] thankful for that. Uh we're going to
[52:04] receive the tithe and the offering. Uh
[52:07] the the year 2026 uh 2025. Let's not
[52:11] rush things. 2025 is coming to an end
[52:15] and we will make an offering bag
[52:18] available on Tuesday night since it will
[52:21] be the last time we'll be together for
[52:24] 2025.
[52:26] Uh we'll not make a spectacle of it, but
[52:28] we will make it available if you didn't
[52:30] bring an offering or tithe with you that
[52:33] you feel like that you need to have
[52:35] credit for in 2025.
[52:38] Uh let's see.
[52:40] Wednesday is the last day of the year
[52:43] and so if you uh give online and you
[52:47] want to have credit beh for 2025,
[52:51] it will have to be timestamped before
[52:53] midnight on uh the 31st. Uh just laying
[52:57] it all out there for you. if if you need
[53:00] credit for it in some way for your taxes
[53:02] and you want it on 2025. So, we're going
[53:06] to receive the tithe and offering today
[53:08] as brother Kate is leading us in
[53:10] worship. Brother Ellas, can I call on
[53:12] you? And brother Ian will let these
[53:14] brothers come to you to receive the
[53:16] tithe and offering and may the Lord
[53:18] bless you as you give to him and and may
[53:22] you see the blessing of the Lord come

[58:16] &gt;&gt; Your children believe
[58:20] THAT YOU ARE THE same yesterday,
[58:25] today, and forever.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; How many of you believe he is the same?
[58:31] Are you sure?
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; I know he is.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; You may be seated today. It is a
[58:38] wonderful privilege to have you in the
[58:39] house of the Lord.
[58:42] I want to say with brother Gley that
[58:44] it's a great honor that his presence is
[58:46] here.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; We are guaranteed it because we brought
[58:49] him with us when we came.
[58:52] But when we join together in a corporate
[58:54] way like this, it just sort of magnifies
[58:57] the intensity of what we carry in him.
[59:00] And I feel him here today.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; It's not about feeling.
[59:05] I know that.
[59:07] But it's about faith.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; But there's nothing wrong with feeling
[59:12] him.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Not at all. We just can't live by those
[59:16] feelings. We have to live by the word.
[59:19] But it's all right to be quickened.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; The Bible said you'll know you're saved
[59:24] because of the quickening
[59:26] &gt;&gt; in your spirit, in your inner man. It's
[59:30] resurrection life on the inside of the
[59:32] believer.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; It's not religion.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but religion has
[59:38] failed me.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; It's not about religion. It's about
[59:42] relationship.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; It's about falling in love with Jesus.
[59:47] There's a lot of religious folk
[59:50] &gt;&gt; who've never fallen in love with him.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; And so for them, it's about being in a
[59:55] box and it's about keeping a rule. And
[59:57] it's about it, you know, just being just
[59:59] like like the order of of the house,
[1:00:03] whatever that is. But it's more than
[1:00:05] that. When you fall in love with him,
[1:00:07] you want to please him.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; And you don't just think about it twice
[1:00:11] a week when you're in church, do you?
[1:00:13] But you wake up every day and say,
[1:00:14] "Lord, direct my feet today. direct my
[1:00:17] my big mouth today, Lord,
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; and let it be words that would bring
[1:00:21] life. If correction is needed, let me
[1:00:24] speak it. But let me speak it from a
[1:00:25] place of love
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; instead of a place of condemnation.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Wasn't it a beautiful wedding yesterday?
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Wasn't that special?
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Uh the presence of the Lord was here as
[1:00:38] brother Gley mentioned or brother Hawk
[1:00:40] when he was praying. I think we we
[1:00:41] gathered here yesterday. uh people from
[1:00:44] all kinds of backgrounds, all kinds of
[1:00:46] places, and uh our love for Jesse and
[1:00:50] Roa brought us together as one. And our
[1:00:53] love for the Lord created a beautiful
[1:00:55] atmosphere here for a wedding.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; And the meal was amazing. and the and
[1:01:01] the the decorating and all the work that
[1:01:03] you sisters uh uh aided
[1:01:07] Sister Martha and her family, all that
[1:01:09] you folks that got behind and served and
[1:01:12] did all the things that you did. Um
[1:01:14] well, it just makes me a pretty proud
[1:01:17] papa. I'll tell you, I sit back and I
[1:01:19] watch and I think, you know, it's so
[1:01:21] beautiful for brethren to dwell together
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; in unity.
[1:01:27] And uh if there's any division among us,
[1:01:29] well, we want the Lord to give us the
[1:01:31] grace to fix that
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; there's a healing bomb in Gilead. Do you
[1:01:36] believe that? Well, I don't have a lot
[1:01:38] of singing voice this morning and we've
[1:01:41] had a lot of singing and I've enjoyed
[1:01:43] every minute of it, but I and I almost
[1:01:47] thought I would wait uh for a week, but
[1:01:52] there's a very special friend of mine
[1:01:54] who's streaming the service today.
[1:01:57] And there were many years that we didn't
[1:01:59] have any contact with one another
[1:02:01] whatsoever.
[1:02:03] And there were there were uh
[1:02:08] there were some hurts and there were
[1:02:10] some disappointments
[1:02:11] that we probably had with one another.
[1:02:14] But God is a God of restoration and
[1:02:17] redemption.
[1:02:19] And it just amazes me at how God can
[1:02:22] bring things around. And that particular
[1:02:25] friend of mine has had a an an extra
[1:02:28] difficult time the last few weeks.
[1:02:32] It breaks my heart when someone says to
[1:02:34] me, "I just want to go to sleep and I
[1:02:38] don't really care whether I wake up or
[1:02:39] not." Well, that that puts me on the
[1:02:42] prayer bones, you know, because I I
[1:02:45] think that the enemy would he'd like to
[1:02:48] maybe weigh every one of us down with
[1:02:50] that kind of depression and
[1:02:53] hopelessness.
[1:02:55] And when I when I got the message, well,
[1:02:58] I began to pray. And I know others that
[1:03:00] knew the the need were praying. And God
[1:03:03] moved. He moved.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; And he may have to move again and again
[1:03:07] and again, but he moved
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; and lifted her heart. And I'm so
[1:03:13] thankful for that. And she asked for me
[1:03:15] to sing this song. And even though she's
[1:03:17] not here, she's on the other end of that
[1:03:19] camera in a state quite away from here.
[1:03:22] And if I mess it up
[1:03:25] or if Cade messes it up,
[1:03:30] I'll do it again another time.
[1:03:35] I'm afraid I'll have to have the words
[1:03:36] for sure. You may be [singing] down
[1:03:41] and feel like God has somehow forgotten.
[1:03:49] That you are faced with circumstances
[1:03:55] you can't [singing] get through.
[1:04:00] Right now [music]
[1:04:01] it seems that there's [singing] no way
[1:04:04] out and you're going under.
[1:04:11] But God's [music] proven time and time
[1:04:15] again he'll take [music] care of you
[1:04:21] and he'll do it again
[1:04:25] for [music] you. God will do it again
[1:04:32] if you'll just [music]
[1:04:34] take a look at where [singing] you are
[1:04:37] now
[1:04:39] and where you've [music] been.
[1:04:43] Hasn't [singing] he always come through
[1:04:47] for you? Well, he's the same now as
[1:04:52] then.
[1:04:55] You [music] may not know how. You may
[1:04:59] not know when. But he'll do it again.
[1:05:03] [singing]
[1:05:06] You see, God knows the [music] things
[1:05:09] that you're going through and he knows
[1:05:13] how you're hurting.
[1:05:18] You [music] see, he knows
[1:05:20] just how your heart has been broken in
[1:05:25] [music] two.
[1:05:28] But he's the God of the
[1:05:32] of the sun in the sea. And he is [music]
[1:05:36] your father.
[1:05:39] You see, he can calm the [music] storm
[1:05:43] in your soul. He'll fix this for you.
[1:05:49] [music]
[1:05:50] And he'll do it again [singing]
[1:05:53] for you. God will do it. I've seen him
[1:05:58] do it. And I know he'll do it again if
[1:06:01] you'll just take a look at where you
[1:06:05] [music] stand now. Remember where you've
[1:06:08] been.
[1:06:10] [singing]
[1:06:11] Hasn't [music]
[1:06:12] he always come through
[1:06:16] for you? [music and singing] Well, he's
[1:06:18] the same now as then.
[1:06:23] You may not know how. You may not know
[1:06:27] [music] when, but he'll do it again.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; You see, he's still God
[1:06:40] and he will not fail you.
[1:06:45] Oh, I know he's still God
[1:06:50] [music] and he's fighting for you.
[1:06:54] [singing]
[1:06:55] Oh, I know [music] that he's God
[1:07:01] and he [music] will not change.
[1:07:05] [singing]
[1:07:08] Just like Moses,
[1:07:10] just like Daniel,
[1:07:13] just like [music] Shadrach and Mack and
[1:07:16] Abednego,
[1:07:18] [singing]
[1:07:19] God will do it again [music] for you.
[1:07:25] He'll do it again. [music] Does anybody
[1:07:29] believe he can if you'll just take a
[1:07:32] look at where you are now? And where you
[1:07:38] man,
[1:07:41] hasn't he always [music] come through?
[1:07:49] Well, he never changes.
[1:07:52] Oh, you may not know how. You may not
[1:07:56] know when, [music] but he'll do it
[1:08:00] again.
[1:08:02] Oh,
[1:08:04] he's still God.
[1:08:09] And he will not fail [music] you. I know
[1:08:13] he won't. Oh, he's still God
[1:08:20] and he's fighting [music] for you.
[1:08:25] Oh, I know he is God
[1:08:30] and he will [music]
[1:08:32] not change. [singing]
[1:08:36] Just like Moses,
[1:08:39] [music] just like Daniel,
[1:08:42] just like Shadrach and Me [music] and
[1:08:45] Abednego,
[1:08:47] [singing]
[1:08:48] God will do it again. [music] Sing it
[1:08:51] with me.
[1:08:57] Lord, do you hear them? I believe you
[1:08:59] will if you'll just take a look at where
[1:09:03] you are now
[1:09:05] and where you've been. [music]
[1:09:09] Hasn't he always [singing] come through
[1:09:14] for you? Well, he's the same now [music]
[1:09:18] as then.
[1:09:21] You may not know [music] how. You may
[1:09:24] not know when,
[1:09:27] but he'll do it again.
[1:09:34] You may not know how.
[1:09:39] You may not [music] know when.
[1:09:44] You may not know how. You may not
[1:09:48] [music] know when.
[1:09:52] But I know
[1:09:54] he'll do it again.
[1:10:00] [singing]
[1:10:02] [music] My God will do it again.
[1:10:06] [singing]
[1:10:11] [music]
[1:10:15] Amen.
[1:10:19] Amen. He will.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, he will. Rachel, he will. Just keep
[1:10:25] trusting him. He will. He's an ontime
[1:10:28] God.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. You, if you'll stand with me,
[1:10:32] we're going to the word.
[1:10:34] Now you know why I don't sing it so
[1:10:37] often. It's a lot.
[1:10:40] Um, and by the way, the mistake was
[1:10:42] mine. Would you give Kate a good clap
[1:10:46] and thank him? And the rest of these all
[1:10:49] of these musicians
[1:10:54] what we do unto the Lord, we ought to do
[1:10:57] with the best of our ability
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; with all the strength that we have.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; I believe that
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; maybe to some it looks like putting on
[1:11:08] or maybe to others it might look showy.
[1:11:11] But I want you to know that we have been
[1:11:14] taught and trained throughout our life.
[1:11:17] If you're going to do it for God, give
[1:11:20] him all you got, do it the best you can
[1:11:23] because he deserves what you can give
[1:11:25] him and a whole lot more.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I don't come to church to
[1:11:31] sleep. Uh I don't come to church to
[1:11:34] observe.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; I come to church, whether I'm
[1:11:37] ministering or not, to worship the King
[1:11:39] of Kings.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. and the Lord of Lords. And he's
[1:11:42] more worthy than we we often remember.
[1:11:47] We're going to the word of God. I'd like
[1:11:50] for you to turn there with me. I'll give
[1:11:54] you the address
[1:11:56] in just a moment.
[1:12:00] He's such a faithful, loving savior.
[1:12:13] Would you go [snorts] with me to
[1:12:15] Leviticus
[1:12:19] chapter 18
[1:12:22] and we're going to read verse 30.
[1:12:25] [snorts]
[1:12:27] Let me just say again
[1:12:31] how wonderful it is to have you here.
[1:12:37] sitting at the table yesterday with
[1:12:40] Sister Martha's family on one side and
[1:12:44] in one end and Jesse's family on the
[1:12:46] other and none of us really have known
[1:12:49] each other.
[1:12:51] There's always that little awkwardness.
[1:12:53] I am extremely awkward at meeting new
[1:12:57] people, but there was just a wonderful
[1:13:00] piece there.
[1:13:02] I like it that way.
[1:13:04] Jesse's grandmother,
[1:13:06] who I have seen only a few times,
[1:13:10] she looked across the table and she
[1:13:12] said, "You know, uh, I used to hear you
[1:13:16] preach at at Gerard Church in Phoenix
[1:13:19] City." And I said, "I certainly never
[1:13:22] knew that."
[1:13:24] The church when I was in that building
[1:13:27] was was not called Gerard. It was called
[1:13:29] Calvary Temple, but that was the old
[1:13:31] Gerard building. and she said, 'I heard
[1:13:34] you many times and enjoyed it very much
[1:13:37] and never knew it. Seeing her, she never
[1:13:40] mentioned it. And then Jesse's boss and
[1:13:44] uh his employer, I guess you should say.
[1:13:46] I'm not very dignified. You can tell his
[1:13:49] boss man and his lovely wife and four
[1:13:52] amazing, handsome boys were here at the
[1:13:54] wedding yesterday. And I am blessed to
[1:13:58] have the desk that belonged to her dad.
[1:14:02] and brother Bobby Freeman who pastored
[1:14:04] in this area for many years and passed
[1:14:06] away so unexpectedly
[1:14:08] and uh the Lord made a way for me to
[1:14:10] have his desk and they were here and we
[1:14:13] had wonderful fellowship up here after
[1:14:15] the reception they mentioned they'd like
[1:14:18] to see the desk it meant a lot to them
[1:14:20] that it was being used continue to be
[1:14:23] used for the work of the Lord so we
[1:14:25] brought them uh in and we just had a
[1:14:27] great time of fellowship and I'm
[1:14:29] thinking if Jesse and Roa hadn't got
[1:14:31] married. Well, we wouldn't have had that
[1:14:33] opportunity.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; So, thank you all
[1:14:39] for bringing together
[1:14:42] kind of an eclectic group of people. We
[1:14:45] seem to collect that kind around here. I
[1:14:49] believe God has a lot of folks like
[1:14:50] that, don't you?
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; If everybody acted the same and uh had
[1:14:54] the same background, it'd be mighty
[1:14:56] boring in the kingdom. But I'm glad that
[1:14:59] God's got jewels from all walks of life
[1:15:02] and from all religious streams.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; And we're all just trying hard to press
[1:15:08] into him
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; because we sense that the end is upon
[1:15:12] us.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Well, maybe you don't.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; But we sense that we're coming to the
[1:15:18] end of of it all
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; and we're ready. I want you to know, you
[1:15:22] better you better know that you're ready
[1:15:24] tonight
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; when you put your head on the pillow. I
[1:15:28] know that some in the who have come from
[1:15:30] the Anabaptist stream were taught in
[1:15:33] their early life that you cannot know.
[1:15:36] And to know that you're saved is pride.
[1:15:39] But the scripture tells us we can know.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; We must know.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; We must have confidence that the blood
[1:15:46] of Jesus Christ is enough. Amen.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter the color of your window
[1:15:52] shade.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; that is here nor there.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; You can you can choose according to the
[1:15:58] community where you are. But remember
[1:16:00] that it's only by the grace of God and
[1:16:03] the blood of Jesus Christ that we're
[1:16:05] saved. Not by a woman's long hair. No,
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; not by her skirt.
[1:16:10] not not by a by a man, you know, trying
[1:16:13] to be a little more uh modest than the
[1:16:16] world uh would prefer. It's not about
[1:16:20] those things. That's not what saves us.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; We live a separated life because we have
[1:16:25] been redeemed.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; And we want to be a light and a witness
[1:16:29] of what the power of God can accomplish
[1:16:31] in somebody's life. But don't ever trust
[1:16:33] in those things
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; for your salvation. It's only only
[1:16:37] through the precious gift. Amen.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Not your uniform,
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; but your relationship.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Leviticus 18:30. Therefore shall you
[1:16:47] keep mine ordinance, that you commit not
[1:16:51] any of these abominable customs, which
[1:16:54] were committed before you, that you
[1:16:57] defile, and that you defile not
[1:16:59] yourselves therein. I am the Lord your
[1:17:05] God.
[1:17:07] He reminds us that we are in the world
[1:17:12] but not of the world.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Can you follow that?
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Let's let's catch just one more portion
[1:17:19] just a small one. Luke chapter nine, red
[1:17:23] letters, the words of our Lord. Verse
[1:17:26] 23. And he said to them all, "If any man
[1:17:30] will come after me, let him deny
[1:17:34] himself.
[1:17:36] You know that sounds easy until you have
[1:17:40] to do it.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Let him deny himself and take up his
[1:17:44] cross
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; daily. How are you going to deny
[1:17:48] yourself? It's a daily It's a daily
[1:17:50] walk.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; This walk with Christ is not a
[1:17:54] oneandone.
[1:17:56] It's a daily walk.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Take up his cross daily and do what?
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Follow me. Not the church, not the
[1:18:04] pastor, not the prophet.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Follow me."
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; If you'll follow him, you'll follow his
[1:18:11] word and everything will be all right.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Father, we come to you in the mighty
[1:18:16] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We are
[1:18:18] helpless and hopeless without you.
[1:18:22] All of our doing, all the labor and
[1:18:25] effort this morning would all be in vain
[1:18:29] if we weren't doing it unto you. It
[1:18:32] would be no more than a show. It would
[1:18:34] be no more than just a concert or a
[1:18:36] performance of some kind. But when we do
[1:18:39] it unto you with you in mind, desiring
[1:18:43] to please you, it becomes worship in
[1:18:46] your sight. And it's beautiful to you
[1:18:49] because you are a jealous God. You tell
[1:18:53] us and you want our affection and our
[1:18:55] attention to be focused on you. And and
[1:18:58] truthfully, Lord, that's a privilege.
[1:19:01] It's a privilege to look away to Jesus
[1:19:03] today. We're looking away to you
[1:19:06] believing that you'll minister to hearts
[1:19:09] from your word before we leave today.
[1:19:11] And all the glory and all the praise and
[1:19:14] all the honor, Lord, let it be unto you.
[1:19:18] Let it be upon you for everything
[1:19:19] [clears throat] that is accomplished
[1:19:21] today. We ask for this grace in the
[1:19:24] mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:19:26] And the saints said, "Amen."
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:19:30] We are in a study, you visitors that are
[1:19:33] here, we are in a study for several
[1:19:35] months now on the life of Samson.
[1:19:40] And uh maybe there are those who would
[1:19:42] like for us to get off of Samson and get
[1:19:44] on to something else, but there's so
[1:19:47] much in this beautiful story about
[1:19:50] Samson. He was born for a purpose.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; He was born for a reason. He was born
[1:19:58] responsible to begin the deliverance of
[1:20:02] the children of Israel from out from
[1:20:04] under the oppression of the Philistines.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; We realize that IT WAS GOD HIMSELF who
[1:20:11] handed Israel over to her enemy.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; For 40 years, God said, "I'm going to
[1:20:16] show you what it's like to do it without
[1:20:19] me.
[1:20:21] I'm going to place you in the hand of
[1:20:23] the Philistines and they are going to
[1:20:25] harass you and mock you and trouble you
[1:20:29] and give you all kind of uh trials and
[1:20:32] hard things to go through. And hopefully
[1:20:34] at the end of that 40 years, you'll
[1:20:36] serve me with a passion that you never
[1:20:38] have before.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; And in the midst of that, I'm going to
[1:20:42] raise up a champion. And he's going to
[1:20:44] be an unusual sort of fellow. My hand is
[1:20:47] going to be on him
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to make him a Nazerite
[1:20:50] from his mother's womb and I'm going to
[1:20:53] require even that his mother live a
[1:20:57] dedicated and consecrated life while
[1:21:00] he's growing in her belly. This is
[1:21:03] instruction that that we don't have in
[1:21:06] any other place in the scripture. But
[1:21:08] God was so investing himself in the life
[1:21:11] of Samson and preparing him for a job
[1:21:15] that needed to be done. And you know the
[1:21:18] story. We've been teaching it piece by
[1:21:20] piece. God gave him supernatural
[1:21:23] strength. A prophet tells us that he was
[1:21:27] not a a musclebound giant. He didn't
[1:21:30] look like Tony Atlas. It you could have
[1:21:32] seen him and he might would have looked
[1:21:34] rather ordinary.
[1:21:36] the Bible story books, they like to to
[1:21:40] picture him, you know, as a mighty man.
[1:21:42] He could lift the house on his shoulder
[1:21:45] or something along those lines. But his
[1:21:48] strength was not in his brawn.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; His strength was not in his muscles. His
[1:21:53] strength was in the power of almighty
[1:21:56] God that had called him and commissioned
[1:21:58] him and given him a purpose for the
[1:22:01] kingdom. He was going to begin the
[1:22:04] deliverance of the children of Israel
[1:22:06] out from under the hand of the
[1:22:08] Philistines. When God showed up to
[1:22:11] Monoah and his wife, he showed up in a
[1:22:14] supernatural way. He showed up in a
[1:22:16] fire.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; The angel of the Lord,
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; right? The angel of the Lord, not an
[1:22:21] angel, not one of a multitude, the angel
[1:22:25] of the Lord, the angel of the covenant
[1:22:27] of the Lord, came and appeared to them
[1:22:30] and told them what was about to take
[1:22:32] place. They they built an altar. They
[1:22:35] offered an offering unto the Lord and
[1:22:37] the fire of God came down on that altar
[1:22:40] and lifted that offering right up into
[1:22:42] the heavenlies.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; That's that's a pretty big production, I
[1:22:46] would say.
[1:22:47] And Samson from that moment on was
[1:22:49] consecrated to be uh a Nazerite. You've
[1:22:53] got to stay away from the vine, from
[1:22:55] wine, from raisins, from grapes,
[1:22:59] anything having to do with the vine. And
[1:23:01] you cannot come near a dead carcass,
[1:23:04] Numbers tells us. And uh then the third
[1:23:07] requirement is he would never be allowed
[1:23:09] to cut his hair, which is certainly an
[1:23:12] unusual arrangement that God had with
[1:23:14] this Nazerite vow. It worked. As long as
[1:23:18] Samson lived under the covenant,
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; it worked. All he had to do was shake
[1:23:24] himself.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; The Bible said the spirit of the Lord
[1:23:27] moved mightily. Amen.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; In Hebrew, it says violently upon him.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; It wasn't just the sweet spirit, you
[1:23:35] know, a a sweet, wonderful, warm
[1:23:38] feeling. It was the mighty raw power of
[1:23:43] God almost more than a mortal body could
[1:23:47] take.
[1:23:49] Sometimes that spirit of the Lord may
[1:23:51] move in a service where you are and you
[1:23:54] may not understand the way people
[1:23:56] behave. But I want you to know there's a
[1:23:58] power that's bigger that's more potent
[1:24:02] than anything that we could experience
[1:24:05] in our everyday life. And we need him.
[1:24:08] It's not an it.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; We need him.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; We need to know that he's there. And we
[1:24:14] need to know that we've surrendered
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; to our purpose. You were born for a
[1:24:18] reason.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; You were born with a why.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; I would guess that your why has
[1:24:23] something to do with the kingdom of God.
[1:24:26] And you may be running in another
[1:24:27] direction today. But I want you to know
[1:24:30] God can run faster than anybody.
[1:24:34] He said, "IF YOU WERE TO MAKE YOUR BED
[1:24:35] IN HELL, I know where to find you.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; If you were to take THE WINGS OF A DOVE
[1:24:40] AND TRY TO FLY AWAY from my presence, I
[1:24:43] know exactly how to bring you right down
[1:24:44] when I'm ready to do something for you.
[1:24:47] I don't know about you, but it thrills
[1:24:49] my heart to know that this mighty God,
[1:24:52] that little part of the chorus we sang
[1:24:54] today, what a God.
[1:24:56] What a God.
[1:24:59] When I when I sing that, when I think
[1:25:01] that, my heart warms because there is no
[1:25:05] God like unto our God. The psalmist
[1:25:07] said,
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; "He's the one true living God. There are
[1:25:11] other gods with a small G out there.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; They are objects of worship. They're
[1:25:18] idols. They're not real,
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; but nonetheless, they're treated and
[1:25:22] honored and respected as gods. But among
[1:25:26] everything that is worshiped on planet
[1:25:28] earth today, there is a living God.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Jehovah of the OLD IS JESUS CHRIST of
[1:25:34] the new.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOT TWO GODS. THERE'S ONE GOD.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; He manifested HIMSELF AS FATHER, AS SON,
[1:25:42] and as holy ghost, but of the same
[1:25:45] spirit.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; And of the same essence. When Mary was
[1:25:49] overshadowed, it wasn't the father that
[1:25:52] overshadowed her. The scripture said it
[1:25:54] was the Holy Spirit that overshadowed
[1:25:57] Mary and yet the father was his father.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; When you read that, you begin to
[1:26:03] understand there's a mystery here that's
[1:26:05] being revealed and unveiled. And if you
[1:26:08] can catch that, you've got some extra
[1:26:10] ammunition to use against the enemy.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; You see, a lot of people sing about him
[1:26:15] and talk about him and witness about
[1:26:17] him, but they've never met him. They
[1:26:18] don't really even know who God is.
[1:26:22] Brother Shelley, is it important to know
[1:26:24] who God is? You're mighty right. It's
[1:26:26] important to know who he is. And if you
[1:26:28] don't know who he is, YOU DON'T KNOW WHO
[1:26:30] YOU SERVE.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; And you DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HE'S
[1:26:33] CAPABLE OF DOING. And you don't
[1:26:35] understand what he requires out of you.
[1:26:38] I PROMISE YOU THIS MORNING, you're not
[1:26:40] here to be your own man. Amen.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; You're not here to be your own woman.
[1:26:44] You're here at this time for a purpose
[1:26:47] and for a reason, and that is to glorify
[1:26:49] God, your creator. SO WHY DON'T WE
[1:26:51] SURRENDER? WHY DON'T WE SURRENDER TODAY?
[1:26:55] WHY DON'T WE MAKE UP OUR MIND? I'M NOT
[1:26:57] GOING TO LIVE ANOTHER ordinary day on
[1:26:58] planet Earth serving sin and self. BUT
[1:27:02] I'M GOING TO SERVE THE living God, the
[1:27:06] creator of all mankind, the only one
[1:27:09] that promises something beyond the
[1:27:11] grave.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. I I uh we
[1:27:16] will gather here Tuesday night at 6:00
[1:27:19] to pay tribute to a a child of God. Uh
[1:27:23] 88
[1:27:25] 89
[1:27:28] 89 years on this planet, served the Lord
[1:27:32] the majority of her life. As much as we
[1:27:35] loved her and as much as we cared about
[1:27:37] her, we couldn't perhaps move on in the
[1:27:40] natural if that was it. But do you know
[1:27:44] what keeps us moving forward? Knowing
[1:27:47] that this is just a momentary
[1:27:51] parting
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; because we're going to see her again
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; AND SHE'LL BE WHOLE AND SHE'LL BE YOUNG
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; AND SHE'LL BE MAGNIFYING THE LORD.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; You know, I believe it.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Sounds like a fairy tale
[1:28:05] to me." Well, I don't believe it is. I
[1:28:07] believe it's more real than the
[1:28:09] atmosphere we're building in this house
[1:28:11] even today. It's more real than the air
[1:28:14] we breathe and the food we eat.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; And he's been good to us when we were
[1:28:18] serving sin.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; He still protected us many times.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; He watched over us many times though we
[1:28:25] were running in an opposite direction.
[1:28:26] Yes, sir.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Didn't he do it?
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Well, I don't know if he
[1:28:30] did or not." Well, you're here, aren't
[1:28:31] you?
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; He brought you a mighty long way.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is. And it may be that only in
[1:28:37] the last hours or years or moments of
[1:28:40] your life that you fully surrender to
[1:28:42] him. But I want you to know it's worth
[1:28:45] it all.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; It's worth it all to know beyond the
[1:28:49] shadow of a doubt that when you laid
[1:28:51] your head on the pillow tonight, you're
[1:28:53] born again.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; And you're ready to meet the Lord. Not
[1:28:56] because you're following the church
[1:28:57] fathers, not because you're obeying the
[1:29:00] restrictions and requirements, but
[1:29:02] because you have entered in to a
[1:29:04] relationship, to a relationship with
[1:29:07] Jesus Christ, to know him, to feel his
[1:29:11] heart,
[1:29:13] to feel his heartbeat, to know that he
[1:29:16] has a mind, to know that he has a will,
[1:29:19] TO KNOW THAT HE HAS A purpose for us in
[1:29:22] these last days. Brother, that's why I
[1:29:24] get out of bed every morning
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; is to give him everything I have.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; I want to give him all give it all to
[1:29:31] him. He's worthy of it. In order to do
[1:29:34] so, Jesus said, "If you're going to come
[1:29:36] after me, you're going to have to deny
[1:29:39] yourself. You're going to have to be
[1:29:41] delivered from your own selfishness, and
[1:29:44] you're going to have to follow me." Now,
[1:29:46] when we were not serving the Lord, we
[1:29:49] were selfish.
[1:29:53] And some of us, even though we uh, you
[1:29:56] know, play serving the Lord, we're still
[1:29:59] selfish. And God said through Jesus in
[1:30:03] this scripture, if you're going to
[1:30:04] follow me, you're going to have to deny
[1:30:06] yourself. And nobody really likes the
[1:30:08] concept. But I want you to know, if
[1:30:11] you're willing to lay down your will and
[1:30:13] take his will, he'll fill you with his
[1:30:16] love divine.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; He'll fill you with the Holy Spirit.
[1:30:20] He'll put a fire down in your heart and
[1:30:23] he'll lead your footsteps and direct
[1:30:25] your life and you can live in his favor
[1:30:29] and in his pleasure.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; It's not about living to the church.
[1:30:33] It's about living unto him.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Can anybody say amen?
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Uh I want to read just a quotation or
[1:30:39] two concerning this one is found in a
[1:30:42] message called At Thy Word uh 1950. A
[1:30:46] person who lives their life for their
[1:30:49] self lives a selfish life.
[1:30:53] We must I'm going to let you read it.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; We must live for others.
[1:31:01] You know, sometimes people get in some
[1:31:03] kind of a rut and they like to think
[1:31:08] that they're living for others, but you
[1:31:11] don't have to be around them very long
[1:31:12] to find out that everything and
[1:31:15] anything, all of it just comes back to
[1:31:17] them,
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; how it's affecting them
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; and how it makes them feel. But I want
[1:31:24] you to know, it's a daily walk and it's
[1:31:26] a daily laying down and it's a daily
[1:31:28] dying. Yes. Amen.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; And as we continue to do that, we're
[1:31:32] coming to a place where we can truly
[1:31:35] say, I live every day for somebody else
[1:31:38] because I want my life to speak to
[1:31:41] somebody else. I want the way I conduct
[1:31:43] my business to be a witness to somebody
[1:31:45] else.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; When I'm in the Walmart and brother, I
[1:31:48] don't go maybe once a year and sometimes
[1:31:51] not even once in a year. That's a
[1:31:53] circus.
[1:31:56] I believe that it you you sisters can
[1:31:59] really be a light down at Walmart. I'll
[1:32:02] be outside praying for you.
[1:32:06] It It's worse than the freeway at
[1:32:08] getting off time. Those buggies going
[1:32:11] every which way. They'll plow you over.
[1:32:14] They wear their pajamas.
[1:32:18] They forget to put their teeth in
[1:32:20] sometime. [clears throat] They're just
[1:32:22] running around with with with some sort
[1:32:25] of purpose and yet no purpose
[1:32:28] whatsoever. That's
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO GET THE NEXT MEAL
[1:32:31] TOGETHER, the next birthday party
[1:32:34] together, the next something else
[1:32:36] together, and they're not many times
[1:32:38] even conscience. They they don't even
[1:32:40] recognize that the end is upon us.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm not going to preach fear to
[1:32:45] you,
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; but the end IS UPON US. THE CONSUMMATION
[1:32:48] OF THE AGES IS breaking forth in this
[1:32:52] hour.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; And the world is more insane and matter
[1:32:56] and wilder than it's ever been. And the
[1:32:58] heathen will continue to rage. And what
[1:33:01] happens out there, IT MUST NOT AFFECT
[1:33:04] WHAT HAPPENS in here. But what God does
[1:33:07] for US IN HERE, IT MUST CERTAINLY AFFECT
[1:33:11] WHAT'S HAPPENING out there. AND THE ONLY
[1:33:13] WAY IT CAN IS FOR us to take this with
[1:33:16] us.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; It's not our four and no more. And it's
[1:33:20] not the boundaries of the four walls of
[1:33:22] this church that we're concerned about.
[1:33:25] It's getting this life outside this
[1:33:27] building.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; And you're going to do that in line at
[1:33:31] if you're brave enough to eat at
[1:33:32] McDonald's. I'm not, but if you are,
[1:33:35] it's in the line there that you're going
[1:33:38] to be able to be a light.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; It's in the line at the gas pump.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It's there that you're going
[1:33:45] to be able to be a light.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; You know, the world is out for
[1:33:49] themselves. It's obvious to see. And
[1:33:51] here comes a Christian.
[1:33:54] Here comes a child of God
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; who says, "I'm sorry you didn't charge
[1:34:00] me for this item and I want to pay you."
[1:34:04] And they look at you like you've got
[1:34:05] three heads. You know why? Because the
[1:34:09] world doesn't behave that way anymore.
[1:34:11] Especially here in the deep south,
[1:34:14] hospitality used to rule and reign and
[1:34:18] people were good and nobody locked their
[1:34:20] doors and and everybody tried to do good
[1:34:23] for others and if you lost a loved one,
[1:34:25] every neighbor on the street made a
[1:34:27] casserole. But we're living in a
[1:34:29] different hour now where people are
[1:34:30] serving self. They're caught up in the
[1:34:33] mad race of the end time and they don't
[1:34:35] even know it.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; They're more excited about the trappings
[1:34:39] of Christmas and other things. more
[1:34:41] excited about the hustle and bustle than
[1:34:44] they are the real meaning of it all. And
[1:34:46] that's Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:34:49] and today and forever in a message just
[1:34:52] simply called Christ. He talks about
[1:34:55] Abel. He said and Abel slew his lamb on
[1:34:58] the rock and Abel died. This is the key
[1:35:01] right here. AND ABEL DIED ON THE SAME
[1:35:04] rock
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; with his lamb. THE LAMB DIED PHYSICALLY,
[1:35:11] BUT ABEL had to die to self.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; We're told that Abel had this one little
[1:35:18] lamb that he had sort of made a pet out
[1:35:20] of, and he'd given it more care and more
[1:35:22] attention, and he loved it more than all
[1:35:24] the rest of the lambs. He did what a
[1:35:27] farmer's not supposed to do. He chose a
[1:35:30] favorite. And when it come time to give
[1:35:32] God an offering, all that Cain could
[1:35:34] think of was his garden. And so he tries
[1:35:37] to give God the fruit of the earth.
[1:35:39] Maybe potatoes, maybe tomatoes, maybe
[1:35:42] turnipss for all I know. But all all
[1:35:45] that we can learn from scripture is that
[1:35:47] it wasn't turnups or or tomatoes or
[1:35:50] potatoes that God was looking for.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; He was looking for blood.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; A total sacrifice.
[1:36:02] The taking of a life.
[1:36:04] It was following a precedent that
[1:36:06] started in the garden much earlier when
[1:36:10] Adam and Eve failed God. The scripture
[1:36:13] tells us clearly that Adam was not
[1:36:15] deceived. Eve was the one who was
[1:36:18] deceived, but Abel willingly partook of
[1:36:21] her sin because he wanted to stand with
[1:36:24] her. And the New Testament tells us that
[1:36:27] this is a beautiful type of Christ who
[1:36:29] knew no sin, but who stepped in and took
[1:36:32] our sin upon him that we could have
[1:36:34] everlasting and eternal life. I'm pretty
[1:36:36] excited about that.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; So, Cain brings his his garden produce
[1:36:42] and Abel recognizes that he's going to
[1:36:45] have to bring a lamb. And I wonder as he
[1:36:48] stood out over that little herd of his,
[1:36:51] I wonder if he was looking for one that
[1:36:54] he might not care for as much as the
[1:36:56] other. But something in his heart kept
[1:36:59] drawing him back and telling him, "The
[1:37:01] God of all eternity and creation
[1:37:04] deserves the best.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; The chosen lamb, the most special one,
[1:37:10] the one THAT MEANS THE MOST TO YOU." And
[1:37:13] Abel knew what he had to do. He took an
[1:37:16] old grape vine, perhaps we're told, and
[1:37:19] wrapped it around the little lamb's neck
[1:37:21] and led him over to the altar. Takes a
[1:37:23] sharp rock, and I don't want to make you
[1:37:25] nauseous, but I want you to see the
[1:37:27] reality of the moment. He takes that
[1:37:30] sharp rock and he starts digging
[1:37:34] at the at the jugular vein of the little
[1:37:37] lamb that he had nursed, that he had
[1:37:40] carried with him, that he had loved
[1:37:42] above all the other lambs. And he starts
[1:37:46] striking that little lamb. The little
[1:37:47] lamb looks up at him. No doubt you've
[1:37:49] heard this kind of thing. LITTLE EYES
[1:37:52] LOOKING UP AT HIM. And that little
[1:37:53] pleading sound is that small little
[1:37:57] pleading sound that can come and he
[1:37:59] knows I I CAN'T STOP NOW. I'VE GOT TO
[1:38:02] FINISH THE JOB. BROTHER BRANDHAM TELLS
[1:38:05] US THAT in in that bloody MOMENT OF AN
[1:38:08] OFFERING, NOT ONLY was the rock altar
[1:38:10] covered with blood, and not ONLY WAS THE
[1:38:13] LITTLE LAMB BLOODY, but so was the one
[1:38:16] offering the lamb.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; It wasn't JUST THE LAMB THAT GOT BLOODY,
[1:38:20] ABEL GOT BLOODY. That's
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; The rock got bloody. The offering got
[1:38:27] bloody. And the offerer, the one who
[1:38:29] would give the offering, got bloody. And
[1:38:32] he tells US HERE THAT NOT JUST THE LAMB
[1:38:34] DIED that day on the rock. Abel had to
[1:38:36] die on the same rock with his lamb. And
[1:38:39] every believer that COMES TO CHRIST MUST
[1:38:42] COME TO THE SAME CROSS OF self-denial
[1:38:46] and die there with the lamb,
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; with his lamb.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you have a lamb?
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; I'm not perfect. I never have been AND
[1:38:57] IN THIS CARNALITY MAY never be. But but
[1:39:00] I want you to know I have a perfect
[1:39:02] lamb, a perfect offering, a perfect
[1:39:04] sacrifice. And when I COME INTO THE
[1:39:07] PRESENCE OF GOD, I DON'T BRING MY MERIT.
[1:39:09] I don't bring my worthiness. I bring the
[1:39:12] worthiness. Oh, just a minute.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to behave myself or visitors
[1:39:20] a little bit. I don't want to scare you
[1:39:22] too bad, but I'm feeling that thing that
[1:39:25] bubbles up on the inside OF THE INSIDE
[1:39:28] THAT MAKES ME WANT TO SHOUT,
[1:39:29] "HALLELUJAH.
[1:39:31] I KNOW THAT I'm redeemed."
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; NOT BECAUSE I GET IT RIGHT ALL THE TIME.
[1:39:36] NOT BECAUSE I ALWAYS THINK IT RIGHT OR
[1:39:38] EVEN SAY IT RIGHT, BUT I KNOW THAT I'M
[1:39:41] REDEEMED BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THE BLOOD
[1:39:44] OF MY LAMB WAS ENOUGH.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; IT WAS sufficient
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; to pay the price. Hallelujah.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Woo. Praise God.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't like when people carry on.
[1:39:57] I'm so sorry.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; I got I've got some news. I better go
[1:40:02] ahead and tell you now. It don't go to
[1:40:04] heaven
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; because if you do, you're going to find
[1:40:12] out. We're not going to be sitting
[1:40:13] around through the countless ages with a
[1:40:15] diaper on playing the harp.
[1:40:20] People don't become cherubs.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; People don't become angels in eternity.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; They're redeemed
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; saints of the most high God.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; So don't be looking for me with a
[1:40:32] diaper. Oh my. Don't get that image.
[1:40:35] Don't be looking for me to spend
[1:40:36] eternity playing a harp wearing a
[1:40:37] diaper. No sire. I'M GOING TO BE GIVING
[1:40:41] PRAISE AND HONOR AND GLORY. NOW, I'M
[1:40:44] GOING TO DO IT AS LOUD AS MY NEW FORM
[1:40:48] WILL ALLOW me to.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO SHOUT IT TO THE TOP OF MY
[1:40:52] AVAILABILITY. I WANT TO SHOUT, "WORTHY,
[1:40:56] worthy is the lamb."
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; It's because HE'S WORTHY. IT'S BECAUSE
[1:41:02] HIS BLOOD IS SUFFICIENT. Then you and I
[1:41:05] can even make a decision today to deny
[1:41:08] ourselves
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; to live unto him and die there with the
[1:41:11] lamb, with his lamb. die out to his own
[1:41:15] thoughts.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:41:21] You know, church has been rough.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; I'm going to let you be a little quiet.
[1:41:29] Church has been rough.
[1:41:33] There's hurts.
[1:41:35] There's disappointments.
[1:41:38] Preachers hurt us.
[1:41:41] Pastors hurt us.
[1:41:43] Church folks can hurt us. I've often
[1:41:46] said the worst hurt in the world.
[1:41:49] I think it's more than your own natural
[1:41:51] family letting you down when your
[1:41:53] spiritual family. It happens. It's bound
[1:41:55] to happen again.
[1:41:57] But we're not here today because of the
[1:42:00] church family. We're here today because
[1:42:03] the lamb is worthy.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; You see, religion will never satisfy.
[1:42:10] [snorts]
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; You can do it all. I said a moment ago,
[1:42:12] you can tick off all the boxes
[1:42:15] and it won't give you the satisfaction
[1:42:17] that comes way down on the inside of the
[1:42:19] inside. And a lot of people would rather
[1:42:21] live in a box of religion than they had
[1:42:23] to have to enter into the scary world of
[1:42:25] relationship.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; You can usually identify those people
[1:42:30] pretty quickly because they they're
[1:42:31] lousy at earthly relationships.
[1:42:37] You see, when you develop a relationship
[1:42:39] with Jesus Christ, it it spills over
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; and you you begin to get better
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; at your other relationships.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; You treat your wife a little better and
[1:42:49] your wife treats you a little better cuz
[1:42:51] she's had a touch. Come on.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; And you're a little kinder to your boss.
[1:42:55] And if he gets a little bit of God in
[1:42:56] him, he's a little kinder to you.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; You see, as you work on your
[1:43:00] relationship with Jesus, it affects the
[1:43:03] relationships that you have with each
[1:43:05] other. Amen.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; So if you see somebody who's not very
[1:43:08] good with their earthly relationships,
[1:43:11] it's usually a tail a a tell sign that
[1:43:15] that something is a little bit a miss in
[1:43:17] their relationship with him. Don't you
[1:43:19] be a judge. But you can be an
[1:43:21] intercessor and you can pray, Lord,
[1:43:23] bring my brother, bring my sister into a
[1:43:27] place where they're fully dependent on
[1:43:29] you. It makes a difference, brother. It
[1:43:31] makes a difference, sister, when we
[1:43:33] become fully dependent on him. Die out
[1:43:37] to our own mental thinking. He said,
[1:43:40] JUST TAKE WHAT THE HOLY SPIRIT says in
[1:43:43] your heart and live for Christ that day
[1:43:47] on Calvary. I'm just going to put the
[1:43:49] highlights of this. He said, but when
[1:43:50] you live your life to yourself, you
[1:43:53] haven't eternal life. Eternal life is
[1:43:57] living
[1:44:00] for others.
[1:44:03] It proved it when it come in the lamb of
[1:44:05] God. He lived had eternal life because
[1:44:07] HE DID NOT LIVE FOR HIMSELF.
[1:44:11] He lived for others. In the mighty
[1:44:13] conqueror, we read, "We'll never conquer
[1:44:15] as long as we're selfish."
[1:44:18] God hates sin and he will not let it
[1:44:20] triumph over wrong.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:23] It's necessary for us to live different
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; than the world around us.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; You see, Samson put himself in a
[1:44:31] compromising position over and over
[1:44:33] again.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; And the next thing you know, the man
[1:44:36] born with a purpose, with a mighty
[1:44:38] anointing, with a supernatural
[1:44:40] announcement of his birth, with the
[1:44:42] spirit OF GOD MOVING MIGHTILY on him, SO
[1:44:45] MIGHTILY THAT HE TAKES A LION BY THE
[1:44:47] BEARD. Come on. TAKES A LION BY THE
[1:44:50] THROAT AND RIPS HIM APART like a goat.
[1:44:54] SOMEBODY SAID, "YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TELL
[1:44:55] ME that he didn't have all kinds of
[1:44:57] brawn and muscles." I am going to tell
[1:44:59] you that because it wasn't by his
[1:45:02] earthly strength
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; that he was able to do that. It was the
[1:45:06] anointing.
[1:45:07] [clears throat]
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; It was the spirit of almighty God on him
[1:45:10] that gave him the strength.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; And then he did what he wasn't supposed
[1:45:13] to do. The church knows, we've already
[1:45:14] covered this. He did what he was not
[1:45:16] supposed to do. He made contact with the
[1:45:18] dead body afterward because bees had
[1:45:20] made some honey there. He took some of
[1:45:23] that honey and took it to his mom and
[1:45:24] dad. Couldn't tell him where it come
[1:45:26] from because if he did, they would know
[1:45:30] that he had broke his Nazarite vow.
[1:45:34] I know that's not foreign to everybody
[1:45:36] in this room. I know that somewhere in
[1:45:39] your life, there have been things you
[1:45:41] couldn't tell your mom and daddy either.
[1:45:45] Because if you did, you'd be telling on
[1:45:47] your own rebellion.
[1:45:49] You'd be telling on your own heart.
[1:45:51] Well, I want you to know sometimes you
[1:45:54] don't have to tell mama.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, let me tell you something about this
[1:45:59] Jesus thing. HE'LL TELL [screaming] ON
[1:46:02] YOU.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; HE'LL TELL ON YOU.
[1:46:08] AND mom will just sometime look at
[1:46:12] and you get mad at your siblings.
[1:46:16] Who told her? I didn't tell her. I
[1:46:19] DIDN'T TELL HER. I DIDN'T TELL HER. WHO
[1:46:21] TOLD HER? SHE'S BEEN PRAYING FOR YOU.
[1:46:25] And sometime this I know it's happened
[1:46:26] in our own home. The spirit of THE LORD
[1:46:29] WOULD SPEAK TO mama and tell her and you
[1:46:32] may hate that in the moment. YOU YOU MAY
[1:46:35] THINK THAT'S THE MOST UNFAIR THING THAT
[1:46:37] COULD EVER HAPPEN IN YOUR LIFE. My
[1:46:38] goodness, why can't I have a normal mama
[1:46:42] that Jesus don't talk to and tell her
[1:46:45] things that's going on in my life? But
[1:46:47] let me tell you something. You'll live
[1:46:48] long enough, I pray, to recognize the
[1:46:51] beauty.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; THAT SOMEBODY WAS CALLING YOUR NAME.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; GO AHEAD AND CALL MY NAME.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; I'm not misbehaving to the best of my
[1:47:01] knowledge. I'm not sneaking around to
[1:47:04] the best OF MY KNOWLEDGE, BUT GO AHEAD
[1:47:06] AND CALL MY NAME EVERY TIME YOU THINK OF
[1:47:08] ME BECAUSE WE ALL NEED STRENGTH AND WE
[1:47:12] ALL NEED SOME PRAYER AND WE ALL NEED
[1:47:14] SOME ENCOURAGEMENT along the way. Thank
[1:47:17] God for a mother and a dad that'll call
[1:47:19] your name before THE LORD.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; THANK GOD FOR A GOD,
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN,
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; who will tell on you when you need to be
[1:47:26] told on.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. God, give us strength to guard
[1:47:32] this fragile, precious, valuable
[1:47:35] relationship that you have made
[1:47:38] available for man to have with his
[1:47:41] creator.
[1:47:43] There there's no way there's no way
[1:47:45] hardly to describe the beauty of it. Can
[1:47:48] anybody say amen?
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Let me give you just another little
[1:47:52] piece here in a message. Why little
[1:47:54] Bethlehem? [clears throat] He said in
[1:47:56] paragraph 80, "Oh, notice Israel
[1:47:58] received a new fresh bread every night
[1:48:00] coming down from heaven for their
[1:48:02] journey. Christ is our life, bread of
[1:48:05] life, and every day we receive freshness
[1:48:08] from Christ from heaven. The Holy Spirit
[1:48:10] coming down upon the believer." I wanted
[1:48:12] to read this because I want you to know
[1:48:14] it's a day by day by day by day by day
[1:48:17] by day.
[1:48:19] God said, "I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU MANA.
[1:48:21] It's going to fall right out of the
[1:48:22] heavens and I'm going to send it to you
[1:48:25] fresh every day. I don't want you to
[1:48:27] store it up until the Sabbath.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; The day before the Sabbath, I want you
[1:48:32] to take a portion for that day and a
[1:48:34] portion for the Sabbath so that you
[1:48:36] don't have to gather on Sabbath. And
[1:48:38] then every other day, I want you to take
[1:48:40] one portion
[1:48:42] because God was setting a precedent for
[1:48:45] us that what he does for US TODAY is not
[1:48:49] enough. WE'RE GOING TO NEED HIS TOUCH
[1:48:53] AGAIN TOMORROW.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; We're going TO NEED TO MAKE CONTACT WITH
[1:48:56] HIM ON Monday just like we did on
[1:48:59] Sunday. And that's not in a religious
[1:49:02] way. That's in a relationship. You can't
[1:49:05] serve him today and love him today and
[1:49:08] adore him today and forget about him all
[1:49:11] about him tomorrow.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; You'll starve.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; You'll fall like Samson. You'll defile
[1:49:19] your commitment and covenant unto the
[1:49:21] Lord.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; It has to be a consistent and a daily
[1:49:24] thing. Well, the children of Israel said
[1:49:26] it's working on on air of Shabbat the
[1:49:28] day before the Sabbath. It's working. So
[1:49:31] why wouldn't it work on a Tuesday and a
[1:49:32] Wednesday, let's say? And so some
[1:49:35] decided we'll go out and gather, you
[1:49:37] know, a man's always trying to figure an
[1:49:39] easier way to do everything and uh we'll
[1:49:42] just go out and gather two days supply
[1:49:45] and then tomorrow we won't have to do
[1:49:47] anything. Well, you know, God had
[1:49:48] already given them very specific
[1:49:50] instructions
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; and they were certainly trying to move
[1:49:52] in their own head
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; and in their own mind. And what did they
[1:49:56] find when they went to their supply?
[1:49:59] It had rotted.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; It had bred worms. The Bible said for
[1:50:03] for you that have strong stomachs, the
[1:50:05] rest of you don't hear, turn your ears
[1:50:08] off. For you that have strong stomachs,
[1:50:10] that's maggots.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; It had it had bread worms and it was
[1:50:14] stinking
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; overnight. Because God said, "I don't
[1:50:18] want you to visit me every other day. I
[1:50:20] DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE FELLOWSHIP WITH
[1:50:21] ME every other day."
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; And all HE WAS DOING WAS POINTING TO A
[1:50:26] DAY WHEN THE VEIL would be ripped.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. AND WHEN THE WAY WOULD BE OPENED
[1:50:30] UP and where you and I WOULD HAVE
[1:50:32] ACCESS, NOT ONCE A WEEK, not twice a
[1:50:34] week, NOT THREE TIME, EVERY DAY IF WE
[1:50:36] WANT IT.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; IF WE WANT IT, WE CAN HAVE FELLOWSHIP
[1:50:40] WITH JESUS CHRIST EVERY [screaming]
[1:50:42] DAY OF OUR LIVES.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "You must have more time
[1:50:47] on your hands than I do." I'll tell you,
[1:50:49] it doesn't matter how busy or unusy your
[1:50:51] life is. The enemy will try to distract
[1:50:54] you. He'll try to pull you away. You'll
[1:50:56] start reading your Bible and the phone
[1:50:58] will ring.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Especially you that have decided that
[1:51:02] you're going to read your electronic
[1:51:04] Bible for the rest of your life instead
[1:51:06] of the oldfashioned kind. I'm going to
[1:51:08] tell you there's less distractions in
[1:51:09] the leather one.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; If you'll just get you the real kind,
[1:51:16] the old kind, and put the other thing
[1:51:19] away for just a little while, because
[1:51:21] I'm telling you, the devil doesn't want
[1:51:22] you eating your daily bread.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. He doesn't want us eating our
[1:51:26] daily meal. And I'm not just talking
[1:51:28] about reading it like a dry letter.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; Did you know to some the Bible is no
[1:51:34] more than a dead letter?
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; But to others, it's living daily bread.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; What makes the difference? Is it how you
[1:51:43] read? Is it the version you read? No,
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; it's not how you read or the version you
[1:51:48] read. It's the relationship that you
[1:51:50] have with the God of the word. Right.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; If you have a relationship with the
[1:51:55] author of that book, then it's more than
[1:51:58] just a chore.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; It's like reading a a text.
[1:52:02] It's like getting a text from your best
[1:52:04] friend.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; It's like going to the mailbox and
[1:52:07] opening up a letter and it being from
[1:52:09] your very best friend in all the world
[1:52:11] and you just read. Folks, if we could
[1:52:13] learn as believers in the end time to
[1:52:16] talk to him in the manner that we would,
[1:52:19] the very best relationship that we have
[1:52:21] in the earth, the best friend, our our
[1:52:24] companion or or whoever it is that we
[1:52:27] feel the closest to. Uh sometimes we get
[1:52:30] caught up in the protocol of how we
[1:52:32] ought to address him and so we just fail
[1:52:35] to address him and all he wants us to do
[1:52:38] is reach for him. Yes,
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; I'm a man. Somebody said, "I'M A MAN. I
[1:52:44] can't relate like that, folk." You can.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; You can if you will. That's
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; If you'll swallow your pride,
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; and if you'll make up your mind, I can't
[1:52:54] live another day without a relationship
[1:52:56] with Jesus Christ.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; You'll find out he wants to hear what
[1:53:00] you have to say.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; WELL, WHAT IF I SAY SOMETHING THAT THAT
[1:53:03] HE'S NOT GOING to like? I do.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; I do.
[1:53:09] I have.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; I probably will again.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; And so far, not one single time has he
[1:53:17] ever smacked me between the eyes.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; I might have hurt his heart. I might
[1:53:22] have disappointed him with what I said
[1:53:24] or how I've behaved. But he doesn't quit
[1:53:26] loving me.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now, I want to help you with
[1:53:30] that. You know that little flare? You
[1:53:32] know that little show out you had? You
[1:53:35] know that little meltdown? I know. I can
[1:53:37] tell by you holy people, you're so holy.
[1:53:40] I can just look at you and tell you're
[1:53:42] holy
[1:53:44] and a little deceptive
[1:53:47] because if you sit there and try to make
[1:53:49] me think that you don't ever say the
[1:53:51] wrong thing or do the wrong thing, well,
[1:53:53] I can't I can't believe that because I
[1:53:56] know how my own flesh will operate.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; But I've got out from under the box of
[1:54:00] religion. And when I did, I found out
[1:54:03] that that one misstep is not going to
[1:54:05] rip me from the kingdom.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; ONE MISTAKE, EVEN ONE ONE UH UH UNWILL
[1:54:14] SIN, BECAUSE THERE ARE SINS OF
[1:54:15] COMMISSION and sins of omission.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST WHAT YOU DO SOMETIME THAT
[1:54:20] GRIEVES THE HEART OF GOD. IT'S SOMETIMES
[1:54:22] WHAT WE DON'T DO that grieves his heart.
[1:54:24] That's right.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; But I FOUND OUT THAT THAT DOESN'T RIP ME
[1:54:27] OUT of his heart because I fail. In
[1:54:30] fact, he just wants to pull me in a
[1:54:32] little bit closer.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; You see, THE CLOSER YOU GET TO HIM, the
[1:54:37] less carnality,
[1:54:39] the less flesh flares
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; you'll have because you'll begin to move
[1:54:44] with his heartbeat,
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; with his desire. I tell you, God sent a
[1:54:48] truth in the last days, not to make
[1:54:50] robots out of people,
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; but to show them the path of
[1:54:55] relationship.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. to show them how to depend on him
[1:54:59] daily, daily bread,
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; fresh. He said yesterday's experience.
[1:55:05] Many of us LIVE ON YESTERDAY'S
[1:55:07] EXPERIENCE. We mustn't do that. It's
[1:55:09] today's experience.
[1:55:12] IT'S WHAT GOD WILL DO FOR YOU NOW. He
[1:55:15] said they're living on that experience.
[1:55:17] But remember the BREAD THAT FELL, THEY
[1:55:19] TRIED TO KEEP IT OVER. IT GOT
[1:55:21] CONTAMINATED. Maggots got in it. Wiggle
[1:55:23] tails. And that's what's the matter
[1:55:24] today. contaminated sistns living on
[1:55:27] past bread that's contaminated. He said
[1:55:31] we must have something fresh from
[1:55:32] Christ. His word today FOR THIS HOUR. HE
[1:55:36] IS OUR FRESHNESS. HALLELUJAH. OUR BREAD
[1:55:39] THAT FALLS EVERY DAY FROM heaven upon
[1:55:42] the believer as a staff of life is
[1:55:44] called bread. Jesus being the bread of
[1:55:47] life is God's staff of eternal life.
[1:55:50] Bread to us. He'll feed you. We're used
[1:55:56] to saying, "Oh Lord, I'm hungry and I
[1:56:00] want to be fed.
[1:56:02] Oh
[1:56:04] Lord, I'm hungry and I want to be fed.
[1:56:09] Oh
[1:56:10] Lord, I'm hungry and I want to be fed.
[1:56:15] Oh, feed me all the days of my life.
[1:56:20] Oh, feed me, Jesus. Feed me. Feed me,
[1:56:25] Jesus. Feed me. Feed me all the days of
[1:56:30] my life.
[1:56:34] Feed me
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus, FEED ME.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; OH, feed me, Jesus. Feed me. Feed me.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; He will.
[1:56:48] He does.
[1:56:50] He desires.
[1:56:52] I want you to look at Judges 14. In the
[1:56:55] time that we have left, do we have time
[1:56:57] left? Oh, we do.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, we do.
[1:57:02] I I I told you folks to tell the
[1:57:05] visitors that we're here for a little
[1:57:07] while.
[1:57:09] Not quite as long as the Amish, though,
[1:57:12] but sometimes we get close.
[1:57:15] Judges chapter 16. Boy, that uh made a
[1:57:18] quiet moment, didn't it? Judges chapter
[1:57:21] 16,
[1:57:23] verse 4. And it came to pass afterward
[1:57:27] that [snorts] he loved a woman in the
[1:57:28] valley of Sorak,
[1:57:31] whose name was
[1:57:33] Delilah.
[1:57:35] And the lords of the Philistines came up
[1:57:38] unto her,
[1:57:40] entice him,
[1:57:42] and see
[1:57:44] wherein his great strength lith, and by
[1:57:47] what means we may prevail against him,
[1:57:51] that we may bind him to afflict him.
[1:57:55] and we will give thee every one of us,00
[1:58:01] pieces of silver.
[1:58:05] I want you to know Delilah did not love
[1:58:09] Samson.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; She never loved him.
[1:58:14] She wasn't capable of loving him because
[1:58:18] she was for sale.
[1:58:22] You You better make sure
[1:58:25] that he's not for sale.
[1:58:28] You better make sure that she's not for
[1:58:31] sale.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; The highest bidder come along and offer
[1:58:34] them something else and they run off and
[1:58:36] leave you sitting right there.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; I've seen it happen too many times
[1:58:40] through the years. They thought there
[1:58:42] was love present. Delilah had no love
[1:58:44] for Samson and all that Samson ever
[1:58:47] really wanted was to be loved. And he
[1:58:50] was under this mistaken principle that
[1:58:54] if somebody will show me attention,
[1:58:57] I hope you'll listen now.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; I'll hurry. This is my hurry.
[1:59:02] [clears throat]
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; I'm taking this most serious.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; Because this is life or death to me.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; I mean that.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; This isn't what I do for a job. This is
[1:59:14] what I do for a living. It's what I do
[1:59:17] for a purpose and a reason and a why. I
[1:59:19] mean, I live to do this.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; And uh I know I was born for it. I'm not
[1:59:25] maybe good at it, but I know that I was
[1:59:28] born for it.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; And I know that I was first created to
[1:59:31] be a worshipper. Yes, sir.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; And everything else flows out of that.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; And I think you if you discover that you
[1:59:39] were born to be a worshshiper first,
[1:59:41] your service to the Lord will flow out
[1:59:43] of that. Amen.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; Don't you let the enemy intimidate you
[1:59:46] to praise him.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; Don't you let the devil intimidate you
[1:59:51] to say, "Hallelujah.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord." Well, I don't want to
[1:59:54] sound religious. Well, I don't want you
[1:59:56] to sound religious, but I want you to be
[1:59:58] sincere and free
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; to praise God the way that your heart
[2:00:03] desires to praise him.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't want to make a spectacle
[2:00:06] of myself. I understand that totally and
[2:00:10] completely. But if you should ever find
[2:00:12] yourself in a house where people are all
[2:00:15] worshiping the Lord in spirit and in
[2:00:17] truth and recognize that nobody is even
[2:00:20] watching you
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; because they have put all their focus on
[2:00:25] him, then I would encourage you in that
[2:00:27] moment to be yourself, to be who God
[2:00:30] really created you to be. And don't be
[2:00:32] ashamed to lift your hands up. I don't
[2:00:35] care if you put them here, here, or
[2:00:38] here. But I'll tell you, the more real
[2:00:41] it gets in your heart,
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; YOU'LL FIND SOMETHING TAKING OVER.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; It's a deep responding
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; to a deep calling.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; OH, YES.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A DEEP THAT'S CALLING TO US.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; In my office last night, I won't say
[2:01:01] exactly the detail of it. I think I may
[2:01:03] have already mentioned something, but I
[2:01:06] I uh was saying to the folks that were
[2:01:10] gathered there about worship and was
[2:01:13] speaking about uh some folks that I knew
[2:01:17] that were so very dead set against
[2:01:20] musical instruments in a service,
[2:01:23] especially anything with percussion.
[2:01:26] And um of course she certainly
[2:01:28] understood that because it was the way
[2:01:30] she had been brought up. But I so I was
[2:01:32] just sort of not making excuse for the
[2:01:34] way we worship but but just explaining
[2:01:36] that sometimes we have people who who
[2:01:39] will stay outside during worship and
[2:01:41] come in for the preaching and we we
[2:01:43] don't find a lot of offense in that.
[2:01:45] We're just glad you're here. And this
[2:01:48] little lady surprised me so much. She
[2:01:50] said, "Well, I loved it today."
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; You don't ever [clears throat] know what
[2:01:57] gets stirring in somebody's heart. The
[2:02:00] first time my mother went to a
[2:02:01] Pentecostal meeting where people were
[2:02:03] free to worship the Lord.
[2:02:06] She was a little Baptist girl and it
[2:02:09] terrified her.
[2:02:12] This was way back and this is when
[2:02:14] they'd ran the pews
[2:02:16] and she said, "Steve, I wanted to just
[2:02:18] die."
[2:02:20] She said, "I've never been so scared in
[2:02:23] all my life. I thought I was going to
[2:02:25] run right out the door. It got more than
[2:02:28] I could handle." And she said, ' But
[2:02:30] then all of a sudden, I just opened up
[2:02:33] and I said to the Lord,
[2:02:35] I don't want to be a fanatic,
[2:02:38] but I want to give you what I have.
[2:02:43] You know, that's all that God is looking
[2:02:44] for.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; He don't want you to act like me, and he
[2:02:48] doesn't want me to try to act like you,
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; but he wants you to make contact with
[2:02:52] him.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; It blesses him.
[2:02:57] It encourages it. It lifts him. Somebody
[2:03:01] said, "I can't believe that." Well, the
[2:03:02] Bible tells us the psalm, it said,
[2:03:04] "Bless the Lord,
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; soul."
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; HEY, SOUL, BLESS THE LORD.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; GIVE HIM PRAISE.
[2:03:13] &gt;&gt; DON'T FORGET HIS BENEFITS.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE IF YOU DO IT QUIETLY OR
[2:03:17] LOUDLY OR SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN.
[2:03:20] UNDERSTAND, YOU WERE CREATED
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; TO HAVE FELLOWSHIP WITH YOUR CREATOR.
[2:03:26] AMEN.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; YOU WERE CREATED TO FEEL A CONNECTION
[2:03:30] BETWEEN YOU AND THE GOD of all eternity.
[2:03:32] And you DON'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE TO
[2:03:34] ANYBODY BECAUSE YOU have had a
[2:03:36] connection with your creator and with
[2:03:38] your savior.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; I don't care what they say about me. And
[2:03:42] some of you in this house know that is
[2:03:44] the truth. I just simply don't really
[2:03:47] care anymore. Let them talk. All I know
[2:03:50] is sometimes it's like a river has been
[2:03:53] birthed on the inside of the inside of
[2:03:56] me. And I don't want to be the dam that
[2:03:58] shuts it down.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; I want to at least be a fountain.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; Just come right out. Let the spirit of
[2:04:06] the LORD RISE [screaming]
[2:04:09] UPON US.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; LET THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD RISE WITHIN
[2:04:13] US. SOMEBODY SAID, "WHAT GOOD DOES IT
[2:04:15] DO?" IT GIVES YOU STRENGTH
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; TO FIGHT THE DEVIL. AMEN.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; SOME OF YOU GOING TO MEET HIM BEFORE YOU
[2:04:21] GET HOME TONIGHT.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO HARASS YOUR MIND. HE'S
[2:04:25] GOING TO TELL YOU A LIE. HE'S GOING TO
[2:04:28] STIR UP SOMEBODY IN YOUR FAMILY. THEY'RE
[2:04:30] GOING TO SAY SOMETHING HARSH TO YOU.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; Something is going to happen.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; And if you have had a connection with
[2:04:37] your creator, IF YOU'VE HAD A MOMENT IN
[2:04:39] HIS PRESENCE, YOU'VE RECEIVED STRENGTH
[2:04:42] THAT YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU WERE
[2:04:43] RECEIVING.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; And it'll make a difference tonight.
[2:04:46] It'll make a difference tomorrow. Come
[2:04:48] on.
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; It's not in vain. It's not a waste of
[2:04:51] time. Delilah didn't love Samson.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; No. No. She was for hire. They told her,
[2:04:58] "All of us will give you,00 pieces of
[2:05:01] silver." And Delilah said to Samson,
[2:05:03] "Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great
[2:05:06] strength lith, and wherewith thou
[2:05:08] mightest bite mightest be bound to
[2:05:10] afflict thee." Now the name Delilah
[2:05:14] the root of it means debated strongest
[2:05:18] options
[2:05:20] to weaken
[2:05:22] to impoverish
[2:05:24] to drain.
[2:05:28] It's the very meaning of her name to
[2:05:31] impoverish.
[2:05:32] To take somebody with a rich heritage
[2:05:35] and a rich legacy and bankrupt them,
[2:05:39] make them
[2:05:41] almost as though they were from wealth
[2:05:44] to poverty,
[2:05:46] running out of all the good things that
[2:05:49] that they had experienced before. The
[2:05:51] life draining out and being sucked out
[2:05:54] of them.
[2:05:56] Another tradition of that Hebrew word
[2:06:00] says it means delicate.
[2:06:03] There wasn't much delicate about Delilah
[2:06:06] except her her put on languishing.
[2:06:10] And when you put all of the meaning of
[2:06:12] Delilah together, it means to weaken, to
[2:06:15] bring low, to make feeble.
[2:06:18] If that's her demeanor toward you,
[2:06:22] she doesn't love you.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; If that's his demeanor toward you, he
[2:06:28] doesn't love you.
[2:06:31] If he sets out to weaken you,
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; come on.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; If she sets out to weaken you, that's
[2:06:36] not love.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; Now, it may be bad training.
[2:06:42] She or he may need to be retrained in
[2:06:45] building relationship. It may not be of
[2:06:48] evil or wicked intent. It may just be
[2:06:51] sloppy teaching.
[2:06:55] Dysfunctional families produce
[2:06:57] dysfunctional kids
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; who spread their dysfunction in all of
[2:07:01] their relationships.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; And it just gets bigger and bigger and
[2:07:06] bigger and bigger and bigger
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; until somebody rises up and says, "If
[2:07:09] God is God, if the word is the word,
[2:07:12] we're going to DO IT LIKE THE WORD.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; We're going to relax a little bit and
[2:07:18] let God do something for us."
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; So, you don't want to weaken your
[2:07:22] partner. You don't want to bring them
[2:07:24] low.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; You don't want TO MAKE THEM FEEBLE OR
[2:07:27] MAKE THEM FEEL FEEBLE.
[2:07:32] If you want a husband to check out of a
[2:07:35] relationship, a marriage emotionally
[2:07:38] very quickly,
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; emphasize
[2:07:44] what he has gotten wrong,
[2:07:49] what he what he doesn't do,
[2:07:52] what he can't do right.
[2:07:56] A woman's love language is usually
[2:07:58] affection.
[2:08:00] And whether we recognize it or not, a
[2:08:03] man's love language is usually honor and
[2:08:05] respect,
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; not worship.
[2:08:09] No woman should have to bow down
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; and cower as though she has no opinion
[2:08:14] or no no, this is not Bible. It's not
[2:08:16] even Bible.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; She should be submissive
[2:08:21] and he should make her
[2:08:23] uh a strong leader. He should be a
[2:08:26] strong leader to her because if he'll be
[2:08:30] that, she will find lots of grace to
[2:08:35] submit to him even if she thinks his
[2:08:38] decision is wrong. But if a woman
[2:08:40] refuses to show her husband honor and
[2:08:42] respect,
[2:08:44] it somehow emasculates who he is. That's
[2:08:47] right.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; It takes his godgiven
[2:08:52] ability from him and he begins to feel
[2:08:55] weakened.
[2:08:57] That's when jealousy starts.
[2:09:00] That's when when supposition starts.
[2:09:03] That's when division starts. I know it's
[2:09:06] quiet in here,
[2:09:08] &gt;&gt; but we ought to know what love does.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; Love builds, doesn't it?
[2:09:16] If a husband will try to build his wife,
[2:09:19] it strengthens the relationship.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; If a wife will try to strengthen her
[2:09:24] husband and build him,
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; it'll draw them closer together.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; This Delilah wasn't interested in a
[2:09:30] long-term relationship. She w she
[2:09:33] rejoiced and desired to SEE. BUT THAT'S
[2:09:35] WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TAKE A WIFE FROM
[2:09:38] AMONG THE ENEMY.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; Just a minute.
[2:09:43] Amen, brother Shelly.
[2:09:47] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FIND HER IN
[2:09:49] THE BAR.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FIND HER IN
[2:09:54] THE WORLD.
[2:09:55] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE OFTEN GOING TO HAVE EXACTLY WHAT
[2:09:57] YOU WERE LOOKING FOR.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; And here's what young men ought to think
[2:10:02] of in this day.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, IT'S NOT JUST THOSE MOMENTS OF
[2:10:06] h of attraction and passion and desire
[2:10:10] that you need to think about. YOU NEED
[2:10:12] TO THINK ABOUT WHO IT'S GOING TO BE
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; THAT DRAWS YOUR LITTLE BABY up
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; preach
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; and nurseshu
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; him or her
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; and the one THAT'S GOING TO TEACH them
[2:10:27] and train them
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; and mold them and make them and shape
[2:10:31] them into being what you as a father
[2:10:34] would desire. Of course with your help
[2:10:36] and assistance.
[2:10:38] You may you may want to run with a
[2:10:40] trolleup now, but you're definitely not
[2:10:42] going to want a trolop to raise your
[2:10:44] children.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; I'VE SEEN SO MANY BACKSLIDE. SO MANY
[2:10:49] YOUNG PEOPLE THROUGH THE YEARS BACKSLIDE
[2:10:51] and they go out there and they have
[2:10:53] their fun and THEY HAVE THEIR PARTY and
[2:10:55] they run with wildness. BUT IT'S AN
[2:10:58] UNUSUAL PHENOMENON
[2:11:01] THAT IF THEY ESCAPE GETTING SOMEBODY
[2:11:04] PREGNANT,
[2:11:06] they almost always start inching back
[2:11:10] toward the church.
[2:11:12] Why? Because they don't want that gal
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; to raise their children.
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; We need to think about that now. I
[2:11:23] wished you'd help me. That's my
[2:11:25] responsibility to say it. As believers,
[2:11:28] it's your responsibility to amen it.
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; And reinforce it in your home.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, it's like the young
[2:11:35] people that go out here and uh ink up
[2:11:38] everything. You know, they just look
[2:11:39] look freakish these days.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; And they forget. When you're young and
[2:11:45] buff and amazing, that makes you look
[2:11:47] buffer and tougher.
[2:11:51] But when you're raising your children
[2:11:55] and when the ship's anchor is hanging
[2:11:58] way down below your elbow, it started up
[2:12:01] here and now it's hanging down there. It
[2:12:03] ain't very pretty.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; IF WE COULD START LIVING WITH WITH THE
[2:12:08] FUTURE KIND OF IN our mind, DON'T YOU
[2:12:11] THINK WE'D CHOOSE DIFFERENTLY?
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; I believe we would. And it's important
[2:12:18] because we're preparing. I know the Lord
[2:12:20] is soon coming,
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; but but the longest day you have here on
[2:12:24] this planet, you want to spend it with
[2:12:26] somebody that you can love and trust.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; And if you can't trust them now before
[2:12:31] the before the I do, you'll never trust
[2:12:34] them on the other side of the I do. It
[2:12:36] doesn't change that. That changes some
[2:12:38] things, but it doesn't change that. You
[2:12:40] better love as much about them now as
[2:12:43] you possibly can
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; because it doesn't automatically change.
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; You see, Samson wouldn't have gotten
[2:12:53] this mess if he'd have been looking for
[2:12:55] a godly woman, a godly wife among his
[2:12:58] own people.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; But he had this spirit of compromise on
[2:13:01] him. Even though born for a purpose, he
[2:13:04] let his own human sensuality and
[2:13:07] impulsiveness and lack of discipline get
[2:13:10] a hold of him. And he goes down to
[2:13:12] Delilah, who is not out to love him.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; SHE'S OUT TO BANKRUPT HIM.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; He was a man of extraordinary spiritual
[2:13:20] power. Yet he left his most important
[2:13:23] the most important role. He left it un
[2:13:25] unattended. He left his soul unguarded.
[2:13:29] And when a man or a woman leaves their
[2:13:31] soul unguarded, it's an invitation to
[2:13:34] compromise.
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; You see, your soul is the mind and the
[2:13:37] will and the emotions. It's the middle
[2:13:39] ground of who you are, and it's the
[2:13:41] battleground of where the enemy will
[2:13:42] fight you. It's the closest part of who
[2:13:45] you are that's connected to your mind
[2:13:47] and to your thinking. Brother Brandham
[2:13:49] tells us, "The greatest battle ever
[2:13:50] fought is fought in the battlefield of
[2:13:52] the mind, which is the realm of mind,
[2:13:55] will, and emotion." And if you think
[2:13:57] about it a minute, you'll recognize that
[2:14:00] when the enemy badgers you, it comes in
[2:14:02] the mind. It comes in the will and it
[2:14:05] comes in the emotions. If we can get
[2:14:07] victory over the middle ground,
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; if we can let Jesus be Lord over the
[2:14:11] middle ground,
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; then that middle ground has the strength
[2:14:15] and ability to pull the flesh
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; into alignment with the regenerated
[2:14:19] spirit of Christ that lives within you.
[2:14:22] This is what we need to know before we
[2:14:24] go. Psalm 1:1, "Blessed is the man."
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, SIR.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; WHY DIDN'T YOU DO IT, SAMSON?
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; BLESSED IS THE MAN THAT WALKETH not in
[2:14:34] the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth
[2:14:36] in the way of sinners, nor siteth in the
[2:14:38] seat of the scornful.
[2:14:40] I'm a King James version sort of guy,
[2:14:42] but I'm going to read this in the
[2:14:44] Amplified just to keep things stirred
[2:14:46] up.
[2:14:48] BLESSED, HAPPY, FORTUNATE, PROSPEROUS,
[2:14:52] AND ENVIABLE IS THE MAN WHO WALKS and
[2:14:55] lives not in the advice and the counsel
[2:14:58] OF THE UNGODLY. WHO CARES what the world
[2:15:02] thinks about how you live?
[2:15:05] &gt;&gt; WHO CARES WHAT THE DRINKING buddies
[2:15:08] think about the way you live YOUR LIFE?
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; WHO CARES WHAT THE NEIGHBOR THINKS? YOU
[2:15:13] DON'T GO TO THE WORLD TO GET YOUR advice
[2:15:15] for life. YOU GO TO THE GOD'S WORD.
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, UH, who walks not in the
[2:15:22] counsel of the ungodly, following their
[2:15:24] advice, their plans, their purposes, nor
[2:15:28] stands submissive and inactive. I'm
[2:15:31] slowing down. In the path where sinners
[2:15:33] walk, nor sits down to relax and rest,
[2:15:36] where the scornful and the mockers
[2:15:39] gather. Don't you mock.
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; Let's not be mockers. That's fun.
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; Somebody was in here yesterday mocking
[2:15:47] just a little bit some of the worship
[2:15:49] that was going on, you know, just kind
[2:15:52] of mocking,
[2:15:54] you know. I I I I don't want to be a
[2:15:57] doomsday somebody. I I I wouldn't do
[2:16:00] that. Even if I didn't understand it,
[2:16:04] I wouldn't want to mock it.
[2:16:08] Sometimes we may find ourselves mocking
[2:16:10] something that that's more real than
[2:16:13] what we have come to experience.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; And there's a price to pay when we do.
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; Uh I've learned that people don't have
[2:16:21] to do like I do to be okay. And the best
[2:16:24] thing that I can do is just let let them
[2:16:26] approach the way they approach. And and
[2:16:29] I'm going to approach him the way I
[2:16:30] approach him. And I'm not going to let
[2:16:32] you influence me otherwise. And I don't
[2:16:34] want to I don't want to particularly
[2:16:35] influence you otherwise. We've got to
[2:16:37] love him and we've got to serve him the
[2:16:39] best way we can.
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; Samson made some big messes here because
[2:16:43] he went down to the to the enemy to find
[2:16:46] his woman.
[2:16:49] And then he began to play with her. He
[2:16:51] knew she wasn't trustable.
[2:16:54] And if you look at the rest of this
[2:16:55] chapter, and I'm I'm nearly done.
[2:16:58] Musicians, I'll even let you I'll even
[2:17:00] let you come because it gives the good
[2:17:01] impression that we're almost done
[2:17:04] whether we are or not.
[2:17:10] And I can feel every muscle in your legs
[2:17:12] all tensing up. They're they're all
[2:17:13] ready to come up here knowing if I can
[2:17:16] just get up there then we know we're we
[2:17:18] know we're within the last hour.
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; And he starts playing. You should read
[2:17:28] it. I won't take the time, but you
[2:17:30] should read the rest of that chapter. He
[2:17:32] starts play. He She says, "What's the
[2:17:34] what's the power? What's the secret?"
[2:17:35] And he tells her three different lies.
[2:17:41] And every time she finds out, he just
[2:17:44] keeps lying to me.
[2:17:47] But in verse 16 it says, "And it came to
[2:17:50] pass when she pressed him daily with her
[2:17:52] words and urged him." Sounds just like
[2:17:54] the devil. So that his soul,
[2:17:59] mind, will, and emotion was vexed unto
[2:18:02] death that he told her, "Oh my, don't do
[2:18:05] it. Don't do it."
[2:18:07] Look at your neighbor and say, "Don't do
[2:18:09] it.
[2:18:10] Don't tell your heart.
[2:18:14] Don't give your heart to somebody you
[2:18:16] don't trust.
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; If you just met her, don't trust her.
[2:18:26] If you just met him, don't trust him
[2:18:27] with your heart. You know, tell him tell
[2:18:30] him tell him uh something.
[2:18:36] Tell him you have a very expensive taste
[2:18:38] and he can't afford you.
[2:18:43] But don't tell him your heart.
[2:18:47] Don't Don't tell her. Don't tell her
[2:18:48] your heart. He He He just got a little
[2:18:52] intoxicated in the moment
[2:18:55] and he just spilled it all. He's fooled
[2:18:57] her three times, but she kept pressing
[2:18:59] him. Let me tell you, the devil is after
[2:19:01] us. He's after you, especially if you're
[2:19:03] not fully surrendered. And he will
[2:19:05] harass you and harass you and harass
[2:19:07] you. He'll never lose your number.
[2:19:09] Right?
[2:19:10] &gt;&gt; He keeps you at the top of his rolodex.
[2:19:12] Oh, you don't know what a rolodex is. Uh
[2:19:15] he keeps you at the top of his contact
[2:19:17] list
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; and he'll just keep dialing and dialing
[2:19:21] and dialing and dialing. And she dialed
[2:19:23] and dialed and dialed UNTIL HE TOLD HER
[2:19:25] ALL OF HIS HEART.
[2:19:28] And he said unto her, "There hath not
[2:19:30] come a razor upon my head, for I have
[2:19:32] been a Nazerite unto God from my
[2:19:33] mother's womb. If I be I mean, he's
[2:19:35] spelling it all now. I I read this and
[2:19:38] I'm thinking sh
[2:19:40] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; Several thousand years too late, but I'm
[2:19:44] saying sh
[2:19:46] THEN MY STRENGTH will go from me AND I
[2:19:49] SHALL BECOME WEAK and be like any other
[2:19:52] man.
[2:19:55] Not because his hair was magical.
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; Samson's hair was the outward sign of a
[2:20:01] consecrated covenant.
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; That's right. Just like a sister's hair
[2:20:06] or a sister's long hair is an outward
[2:20:09] sign of a consecrated covenant.
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; And I would to God that you wouldn't let
[2:20:16] this world talk you out of your covenant
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; with the king.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; I I get way too involved
[2:20:27] in just about everything.
[2:20:29] And when I see people coming out of
[2:20:32] religious systems
[2:20:35] that have controlled them and driven
[2:20:37] them,
[2:20:39] boxed them,
[2:20:41] and yet I see them coming out, and
[2:20:43] you're just about to praise God for
[2:20:45] bringing them out of that kind of
[2:20:46] bondage, and the next thing you know,
[2:20:48] they've gone all the way over to the
[2:20:51] other side.
[2:20:54] I might preach a minute
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; and the next time you you you observe
[2:20:58] their life, they've gone way over to the
[2:21:01] other side.
[2:21:04] When I see precious women who have come
[2:21:06] out of some of the different structures
[2:21:08] of the Anabaptist and and they and and
[2:21:10] they're in their genes and they're and
[2:21:12] they're all the way over there, it
[2:21:14] breaks my heart. They live this life uh
[2:21:19] for so long and then they uh they throw
[2:21:22] the baby out with the bathwater
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; and it it breaks my heart because I
[2:21:26] believe it breaks God's heart.
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; It's it's the mind of God according to
[2:21:32] the New Testament that a woman keep her
[2:21:36] hair long.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; The scripture says, and I don't mean
[2:21:39] this in in an offensive way to anyone
[2:21:42] because your conviction I will honor it.
[2:21:44] You ask anybody that knows me, I will
[2:21:47] honor your conviction even if it's
[2:21:48] different from mine. But the scripture
[2:21:51] said that that long hair is given her
[2:21:54] for a covering.
[2:21:56] And it's an amazing thing that she has
[2:22:00] this opportunity to go out into this old
[2:22:02] world and say, "I just want to be his.
[2:22:08] I want to be my husband's bride. And I
[2:22:12] want to be my creator's daughter, his
[2:22:15] servant. And I don't care what the fads
[2:22:17] say, and I don't care what the world
[2:22:19] says. I'm going to keep the scissors out
[2:22:22] of mine.
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be an example to a dying
[2:22:26] world. It's it's an outward sign. It's
[2:22:29] not salvation, but it's an outward sign
[2:22:32] of an inward covenant. And in the same
[2:22:35] manner, 1 Corinthians chapter 11 tells
[2:22:36] us that it's a shame. Even nature itself
[2:22:39] teaches you that it's a shame for a man
[2:22:41] to have long hair. The Bible says that,
[2:22:44] you know, New Testament.
[2:22:47] And the Bible says that if a man uh
[2:22:50] prays or prophesies with his head
[2:22:52] covered,
[2:22:54] this is dishonoring and disrespectful to
[2:22:56] his creator.
[2:22:58] He's not supposed to have this piled on
[2:23:01] his head. He's supposed to live it. And
[2:23:04] you know, people say that's out equated.
[2:23:06] That's outdated. That has nothing to do
[2:23:08] with it. Well, here's all it has to do
[2:23:09] with. It's an outward sign of an inward
[2:23:12] covenant. And it says to the world
[2:23:15] around you, I don't care what Hollywood
[2:23:18] does. I don't care what everybody else
[2:23:21] does. My pressure is not going to come
[2:23:24] from the world.
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; My responsibility is going to come by
[2:23:27] the word. Anybody here? AMEN.
[2:23:31] &gt;&gt; HE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE TOLD HER HIS SECRET
[2:23:34] &gt;&gt; IF HE WASN'T GOING TO EXPECT HER TO DO
[2:23:37] SOMETHING about it. He may not have
[2:23:39] known how much silver was laying on the
[2:23:41] deal.
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; But he knew something was among
[2:23:48] just spilled his Let me step out of the
[2:23:51] pull pit. He just spilled his guts.
[2:23:54] He just told her everything and she
[2:23:57] couldn't wait to put him to sleep.
[2:24:00] Oh, she's rubbing his temples.
[2:24:03] She's got essential oils and she's
[2:24:06] trying to get him to sleep.
[2:24:09] You're getting sleepy.
[2:24:12] And as soon as he was out,
[2:24:15] she calls him in.
[2:24:18] It's rough. It's tough.
[2:24:24] She said, "You've been mocking me." in
[2:24:26] verse 13 telling me lies.
[2:24:29] Now tell me wherewith thou mightest be
[2:24:31] bound. And that last lie he said if you
[2:24:33] weave seven locks of my head with a web.
[2:24:36] And she fastened it with a pin man bun
[2:24:38] or something here. And said unto him the
[2:24:41] Philistines be upon thee Samson. He
[2:24:43] waked out of his sleep and went away
[2:24:44] with a pin of the beam and with the web.
[2:24:48] She had him connected. She she she sort
[2:24:50] of tied him in.
[2:24:53] Kind of a sad thing.
[2:24:56] Then she tell he tells it all.
[2:25:00] And when Delilah saw verse 18, when
[2:25:02] Delilah saw that he had told her all his
[2:25:04] heart, she knew the difference.
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; She sent she sent and called for the
[2:25:09] lords of the Philistines, saying, "Come
[2:25:10] up this once, for he hath showed me all
[2:25:12] his heart." Then the lords of the
[2:25:14] Philistines came up unto her, and
[2:25:15] brought money in their hand, and she
[2:25:17] made him sleep upon her knees.
[2:25:20] And she called for a man and she caused
[2:25:22] him to shave off the seven locks of his
[2:25:23] head and she began to afflict him and
[2:25:26] his strength went from him. Of course it
[2:25:28] did.
[2:25:31] And in verse 20,
[2:25:33] this is the last for today. I I hope
[2:25:35] you'll maybe check back with us for the
[2:25:38] next installment.
[2:25:40] But in verse 20, this is one of the
[2:25:42] saddest
[2:25:44] moments in Samson's great life.
[2:25:48] The Bible said he was slaying them hip.
[2:25:52] How how did it word that? Hip and hip
[2:25:54] and thigh
[2:25:56] in in in just a few moments he' taken
[2:25:58] out a thousand Philistines. He used the
[2:26:01] jawbone of an old donkey.
[2:26:05] God had mightily. They they tie him to
[2:26:07] the gates of Gaza and they lay and wait
[2:26:11] till for the sunrise. And before the
[2:26:13] sunrise comes, he decides, I'm going to
[2:26:15] go on ahead. And he just takes the gates
[2:26:17] of Gaza with him.
[2:26:19] The spirit of the Lord again mightily
[2:26:22] mightily on him. And this is the saddest
[2:26:26] saddest thing for me. Verse 20. And and
[2:26:30] she said as SHE HAD SAID THREE TIMES
[2:26:33] BEFORE AND it was a lie.
[2:26:37] IT WAS A LIE. IT [screaming] WAS A LIE.
[2:26:39] IT WAS A LIE UNTIL IT WASN'T A LIE.
[2:26:42] That's how the devil works.
[2:26:46] You see, I I did such and and didn't
[2:26:49] make a difference. You see, I I DID IT
[2:26:51] AGAIN. DIDN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
[2:26:54] I I went a little further. Didn't make a
[2:26:56] difference. And And then
[2:26:59] you It makes a difference. You're
[2:27:01] caught. SEE, I DID THAT AND I'M not
[2:27:02] addicted. You see, I I DID THAT AND I'm
[2:27:04] not addicted. AND I DID THAT AND and now
[2:27:09] I can't live without it.
[2:27:12] This is how it works. A lie. lie a lie a
[2:27:14] lie and then not a lie. And he'll walk
[2:27:17] out of his sleep AND SAID, "I WILL GO
[2:27:19] OUT AS AT OTHER TIMES BEFORE.
[2:27:24] I'm going to show these Philistines
[2:27:27] the power of the Lord." Well, if you're
[2:27:30] going to do that, you better keep your
[2:27:32] head off of Delilah's lap
[2:27:35] &gt;&gt; because this time he just shook himself
[2:27:38] as he had many times before. AND WHEN HE
[2:27:41] WOULD SHAKE HIMSELF,
[2:27:44] the covenant that was on his head
[2:27:47] would pull the power. That's what
[2:27:49] scripture said. IT WOULD PULL THE POWER
[2:27:52] OF GOD TO MOVE mightily upon him and he
[2:27:55] would then defeat the enemy. But this
[2:27:57] time, he shook himself
[2:28:01] and there was nothing.
[2:28:03] NO SENSATION, NO FEELING, NO EMOTION, NO
[2:28:06] CHANGE, NOTHING. AND HE SHOOK HIMSELF
[2:28:08] AGAIN PROBABLY.
[2:28:10] AND MAYBE AGAIN AND AGAIN, I DON'T KNOW
[2:28:12] HOW MANY TIMES HE SHOOK HIMSELF, BUT
[2:28:15] THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ON THE
[2:28:17] OTHER END OF THE LINE
[2:28:20] BECAUSE NOW THREE TIMES he had defiled
[2:28:22] the reason of his birth.
[2:28:25] First in the vineyard in Timnath. Second
[2:28:29] with the carcass of the lion. Third,
[2:28:32] he's now laid his head into Delilah's
[2:28:35] lap, given away the secret.
[2:28:38] THREE TIMES he had yielded to the
[2:28:40] temptation of the enemy and he had
[2:28:43] sinned against the reason why he was
[2:28:45] born. It didn't make a difference the
[2:28:48] first time, didn't make much of a
[2:28:50] difference the second time, but oh that
[2:28:52] third time here, he couldn't get it
[2:28:54] back.
[2:28:58] It had lifted.
[2:29:00] And this is what he said. I don't want
[2:29:02] to try to be dramatic, but it gets me
[2:29:04] pretty tough. And he wished not.
[2:29:09] And he wished not that the Lord was
[2:29:12] departed from him.
[2:29:16] Time and time and time and time again,
[2:29:19] he had felt that uncction, that life,
[2:29:20] that quickening power. But this time, he
[2:29:24] had made one step too far.
[2:29:27] And he'd given away a secret and the
[2:29:29] covenant THAT KEPT HIM CONNECTED
[2:29:32] to the reason why he was born. He let
[2:29:35] that be
[2:29:37] fooled with and shaved off. And there
[2:29:42] was no longer anything
[2:29:44] to connect him to his why, to the
[2:29:47] purpose of his birth. And the spirit of
[2:29:49] the Lord lifted off of him. I want you
[2:29:51] to know it's the saddest scene.
[2:29:55] And if you if you follow the story, and
[2:29:57] we're closing, but if you follow the
[2:29:59] story,
[2:30:01] it was the end. It was the beginning of
[2:30:04] the end and the end of the beginning all
[2:30:08] at the same time [clears throat] because
[2:30:11] now he was captive to those who despised
[2:30:17] his strength and who wanted him dead.
[2:30:20] And the first thing they did
[2:30:25] was what?
[2:30:27] They put out his eyes
[2:30:30] because the devil knows
[2:30:32] if he can remove vision
[2:30:36] from the people of God,
[2:30:39] if he can discourage them from believing
[2:30:42] that they can see truth and pursue it,
[2:30:47] he'll blind you every time.
[2:30:50] He'll blindfold you first. Yes, sir. And
[2:30:53] if that doesn't work, he'll
[2:30:56] put out your eyes
[2:30:59] &gt;&gt; because he wants to stop us
[2:31:02] &gt;&gt; from finishing the race. Well,
[2:31:05] &gt;&gt; but let me say as you stand,
[2:31:08] this is not the end. It's it's the end
[2:31:11] of my message. Aren't you glad? SAY
[2:31:13] AMEN.
[2:31:14] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S NOT THE END OF THE STORY. AMEN.
[2:31:17] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JUST DOWN THE ROAD, IF YOU'VE
[2:31:20] EVER KNOWN ANYTHING ABOUT HAIR,
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; oh my,
[2:31:25] &gt;&gt; when I realized yesterday how shaggy
[2:31:28] mine was looking, I was embarrassed. I
[2:31:30] get a haircut every other Tuesday
[2:31:35] and this Tuesday is my time. And so
[2:31:38] those last few days sometimes it looks a
[2:31:41] little sha I don't believe you'll call
[2:31:43] it long
[2:31:45] but but a little shaggy
[2:31:47] and sometimes I go back in two weeks and
[2:31:49] she says it's hardly grown and other
[2:31:52] times I go back and she said it's really
[2:31:54] grown this time. I don't understand all
[2:31:56] that. I'm just glad it's still growing
[2:31:58] and not turning loose.
[2:32:01] I'm always delighted. I ask her at least
[2:32:04] once a month. Is it thinning too much up
[2:32:06] there? No, no, no, no. And she said,
[2:32:07] "It's all right.
[2:32:11] I pay her.
[2:32:14] She'll say anything. Probably she might
[2:32:16] even hear this.
[2:32:19] It'll grow. THE ONE THING I KNOW ABOUT
[2:32:21] OH, SORRY, JONATHAN.
[2:32:26] SORRY, BEN.
[2:32:28] IN MOST CASES, IT'LL GROW.
[2:32:33] IT'S NOT OVER AS LONG AS IT'S GROWING.
[2:32:37] AND THE BIBLE TELLS US AND THE PROPHET
[2:32:39] TOLD US THERE WAS A LITTLE SHOCK OF
[2:32:40] HAIR.
[2:32:42] &gt;&gt; HE'S BLINDED
[2:32:44] AND HE IS
[2:32:46] ABSOLUTELY TREADING THE GRAIN like a
[2:32:50] beast.
[2:32:52] &gt;&gt; HE'S HE'S MARCHING IN A CIRCLE BLIND
[2:32:56] TIED TO THE GRINDING STONE.
[2:33:00] &gt;&gt; BLINDLY PUSHING AND MAKING HIS CIRCLE.
[2:33:04] BUT ALL THE TIME THEY'RE MOCKING AND
[2:33:08] THEY'RE LAUGHING A AND THEY'RE TALKING
[2:33:11] ABOUT WHAT A CHAMPION HE WAS. BUT IN ALL
[2:33:14] OF THAT MOMENT OF OF CYCLING AND
[2:33:18] CIRCLING AROUND, his hair was beginning
[2:33:21] to grow again BECAUSE GOD WASN'T
[2:33:25] FINISHED.
[2:33:28] &gt;&gt; SAMSON COMPROMISED. SAMSON FAILED.
[2:33:32] SAMSON MESSED UP,
[2:33:34] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[2:33:36] &gt;&gt; AND YET [screaming] GOD SAID, "I'M NOT
[2:33:38] THROUGH WITH YOU. YOU WERE BORN FOR A
[2:33:42] PURPOSE, FOR A REASON,
[2:33:47] &gt;&gt; AND I'M GOING TO RENEW. I'M GOING TO LET
[2:33:49] THAT HAIR GROW. And I'm going to
[2:33:51] reconnect with you for one final
[2:33:57] showdown."
[2:34:01] I was shocked when I saw all the
[2:34:05] times that Brother Brandham spoke about
[2:34:07] Samson
[2:34:10] pages and pages and pages. He loved the
[2:34:13] story
[2:34:15] and he particularly loved the prayer
[2:34:18] that was said at the pillar. I'll close
[2:34:21] for the 15th time with this.
[2:34:25] He doesn't have time to get religious
[2:34:28] and he doesn't have time
[2:34:30] to do all the, you know, the work, but
[2:34:35] he's got enough time to scream out
[2:34:38] JUST ONCE MORE, LORD.
[2:34:43] AND BECAUSE HIS hair had began to grow
[2:34:48] &gt;&gt; and was no longer being cut,
[2:34:51] HE WAS RECONNECTED TO THE covenant and
[2:34:54] repositioned for the purpose of his
[2:34:57] birth and for his wife, for his reason.
[2:34:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:35:00] &gt;&gt; And one more time, God looked down and
[2:35:02] he said, "This is it, son.
[2:35:06] This is it.
[2:35:08] I'm going to show them who's Lord over
[2:35:11] Israel. I'm going to show them who's
[2:35:12] Lord over the Philistines. And even
[2:35:15] though you failed me and disappointed me
[2:35:17] and compromised on your on your
[2:35:19] covenant, I love you and I'm going to
[2:35:23] use you.
[2:35:25] I'm going to hear your prayer just once
[2:35:27] more. And the scripture tells us that
[2:35:30] Samson destroyed more of the enemies of
[2:35:33] Israel in his in his death at the end of
[2:35:36] his life than he had in the entirety
[2:35:40] of his lifespan.
[2:35:43] Because when God gives you a purpose, a
[2:35:46] reason, and a calling, you may drop it,
[2:35:51] you may lose it, you may fail at it, but
[2:35:54] God doesn't forget. I want you to know
[2:35:57] God is not a politician and he will not
[2:36:00] make a promise that he will not keep.
[2:36:03] &gt;&gt; If God said it, it settles it.
[2:36:06] &gt;&gt; IF GOD PROMISED IT, HE IS duty bound to
[2:36:09] his own word.
[2:36:12] &gt;&gt; And while you were in your mother's
[2:36:14] tummy,
[2:36:15] &gt;&gt; there was a purpose for you being there.
[2:36:18] &gt;&gt; There was a reason why you were there.
[2:36:21] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I just don't know if I
[2:36:23] can get all that." Sure, there was a
[2:36:24] reason. My mother and father had been
[2:36:27] intimate together. Yes, but that's not
[2:36:30] the part of you I'm talking about. That
[2:36:32] part is where your DNA come from. And
[2:36:36] that part is from where your natural
[2:36:38] genetics come from. And that's why you
[2:36:40] have the color hair you have and the
[2:36:42] kind of eyes you have. And that's why
[2:36:44] you're as I mean as handsome and
[2:36:47] beautiful as you are. Because that comes
[2:36:49] from the mom and the dad. That comes
[2:36:51] from the natural. And that is definitely
[2:36:53] an important part of who YOU ARE. BUT
[2:36:55] ABOVE THAT,
[2:36:56] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[2:36:57] &gt;&gt; BEFORE THE WORLD WAS FRAMED, YES, SIR,
[2:37:00] &gt;&gt; God knew you.
[2:37:01] &gt;&gt; HE KNEW YOUR NAME BEFORE YOUR MOTHER
[2:37:03] KNEW YOUR NAME.
[2:37:05] &gt;&gt; HE KNEW YOUR LIFE. IN FACT, THE
[2:37:07] SCRIPTURE SAID, "EVERY DAY OF YOUR LIFE
[2:37:09] WAS ALREADY WRITTEN AS PAGES IN THE BOOK
[2:37:12] of the Lord."
[2:37:13] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE GO, "OH, WHAT A GOD. OH, WHAT
[2:37:15] A GOD. OH, WHAT A GOD I SERVE."
[2:37:18] AND IN THAT MOMENT, he had a purpose for
[2:37:21] you being here. It's that God part of
[2:37:24] you that I'm talking about.
[2:37:26] It's that part of himself that he placed
[2:37:28] over your life in addition to what
[2:37:31] mother and father had provided. That's
[2:37:34] the why. That's the reason. That's the
[2:37:36] purpose. And I want you to know that you
[2:37:39] will never have perfect peace.
[2:37:42] You'll never have real joy until you
[2:37:45] find yourself walking in the reason of
[2:37:48] your birth.
[2:37:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you so much for that.
[2:37:54] Amen.
[2:37:56] Because it's a critical moment to say
[2:37:58] amen.
[2:37:59] &gt;&gt; You'll never You may have a wife. You
[2:38:01] may have a lovely wife. You may have
[2:38:03] wonderful children. You may have a
[2:38:05] successful business. You may live in a
[2:38:06] pretty nice home. You may even have
[2:38:08] indoor plumbing.
[2:38:11] But you'll never find real happiness,
[2:38:14] real peace, real joy, and a real reason
[2:38:16] for living
[2:38:18] &gt;&gt; until you start stepping.
[2:38:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, I feel him now.
[2:38:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:38:24] &gt;&gt; In the in the reason for your birth.
[2:38:26] &gt;&gt; And you know what? You can do it today
[2:38:28] because it's not about joining church.
[2:38:31] It's not about anything like that. It's
[2:38:33] simply about saying, "I
[2:38:37] surrender
[2:38:39] all.
[2:38:42] I
[2:38:44] surrender
[2:38:47] all.
[2:38:51] All all
[2:38:53] to thee,
[2:38:55] my blessed
[2:38:58] savior,
[2:39:01] I
[2:39:02] Surrender
[2:39:05] all to Jesus.
[2:39:10] I
[2:39:12] surrender
[2:39:14] all
[2:39:16] to him. I freely
[2:39:21] give. No one is persuading me or
[2:39:24] constraining me.
[2:39:26] I freely give it to him.
[2:39:30] I'M MAKING A MESS of my life AND I
[2:39:33] FREELY GIVE IT TO him
[2:39:36] &gt;&gt; to do with it as he will
[2:39:39] to step into my purpose.
[2:39:42] Oh, I
[2:39:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[2:39:47] [music] I surrender all.
[2:39:51] Oh, I [music]
[2:39:53] &gt;&gt; I surrender.
[2:39:55] I surrender all
[2:39:59] all
[2:40:01] to thee
[2:40:03] my blessed
[2:40:06] Savior
[2:40:08] I
[2:40:10] surrender
[2:40:12] all
[2:40:13] sing this verse
[2:40:15] and all
[2:40:17] to Jesus
[2:40:20] I oh God
[2:40:24] I want to lay it down again. [music]
[2:40:28] &gt;&gt; I want to lay it down again, Lord. I
[2:40:30] want to lay my will down again. Worldly
[2:40:34] worldly pleasure.
[2:40:37] Oh, forsaken
[2:40:40] take me. [music]
[2:40:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, I
[2:40:51] surrender. [music]
[2:40:54] He wants your yes.
[2:40:59] [music]
[2:41:02] SOMEBODY'S BEEN ASKING, "WHAT DOES HE
[2:41:04] WANT FROM ME?" [music] GOD, WHAT DO you
[2:41:07] want FROM ME? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT he
[2:41:09] wants. He wants your yes.
[2:41:14] He just wants your yes.
[2:41:18] Sing it again with Benjamin, would you?
[2:41:21] I
[2:41:24] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:41:25] &gt;&gt; I surrender all. Oh, I
[2:41:31] surrender.
[2:41:32] Oh, I surrender [music] all.
[2:41:38] To thee, my blessed
[2:41:43] Savior,
[2:41:45] I
[2:41:46] surrender.
[2:41:48] Do [singing] it one more time, son.
[2:41:50] [music]
[2:41:51] Oh, and I
[2:41:54] surrender
[2:41:56] all. We lay it down today. Oh, I
[2:42:02] surrender
[2:42:04] all. [music]
[2:42:07] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we pick it up and we go on
[2:42:10] &gt;&gt; to thee. We just [music] say, "Lord,
[2:42:12] come."
[2:42:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, savior.
[2:42:16] I
[2:42:18] surrender.
[2:42:20] It doesn't matter to me where you
[2:42:22] surrender.
[2:42:24] You can surrender up here. You ought to
[2:42:26] really give the devil a black eye and
[2:42:28] show him that the pew is not going to
[2:42:31] hold you. But it doesn't matter where.
[2:42:33] Do it right where you are. Do it where
[2:42:34] you feel comfortable. You don't have to
[2:42:36] do it loud enough for me to hear you.
[2:42:39] You don't have to tell the person next
[2:42:40] to you who said it. But I challenge you
[2:42:45] with a heart of concern for your life.
[2:42:49] You don't know me. How could you be
[2:42:50] concerned about me? Because
[2:42:53] it's his heart for you that I feel, not
[2:42:55] mine.
[2:42:57] And he just wants your yes. So, so do it
[2:42:59] right where you are if that's best for
[2:43:01] you.
[2:43:03] But make it count.
[2:43:07] Make it count. How do I do that? By
[2:43:10] determining
[2:43:12] that it's not just going to be this
[2:43:13] moment. You're going to take your yes
[2:43:16] with you
[2:43:17] &gt;&gt; when you leave here. And when the enemy
[2:43:20] tries to talk you out of it, you're
[2:43:21] going to you're going to use God's word
[2:43:23] to defeat the enemy. And you're going to
[2:43:25] say, "It may be a humble start. It may
[2:43:27] be a feeble start, but I've started
[2:43:30] [music] on the journey of full
[2:43:31] surrender.
[2:43:33] I want him to be Lord." Listen, if if
[2:43:36] Christ is not Lord of all,
[2:43:39] he has no interest of being your Lord at
[2:43:42] all. It's only when you're willing to
[2:43:45] say, "Above it all, Jesus, I want you to
[2:43:47] stand above it all. I want you to sit
[2:43:49] above it all. I want you I want I want
[2:43:52] your decisions
[2:43:55] to be my leadership.
[2:43:57] Not my will, Lord, but yours be done."
[2:44:02] Father, I I'm going to just pray now,
[2:44:03] Benjamin.
[2:44:06] Usually, we wait a moment, but I just I
[2:44:08] just have to capture this now. Father,
[2:44:10] in the name of Jesus,
[2:44:15] These are not my people. They're your
[2:44:17] people.
[2:44:19] They're all part of the family of God.
[2:44:22] And somebody today, I know it as good as
[2:44:25] I know my name. Somebody today is going
[2:44:29] to give a yes a little louder
[2:44:32] spiritually than before. Somebody is
[2:44:35] going to make a fuller surrender than
[2:44:37] what they have made before. and you're
[2:44:39] going to rush in and make the difference
[2:44:41] in their life as only you can. So Lord,
[2:44:44] I just ask you to protect this moment
[2:44:46] right now. Would you send the very
[2:44:49] presence of the living God and the power
[2:44:52] of the Holy Spirit to guard this moment
[2:44:54] right now that the enemy not be able to
[2:44:57] distract us in any way or to dissuade or
[2:45:01] to discourage? This is a moment between
[2:45:04] a a man and his God, a woman and her
[2:45:08] God. even a child and their God.
[2:45:12] &gt;&gt; And this is holy.
[2:45:14] It's not about shaking a hand or joining
[2:45:17] a church. It's about saying, "Lord, I've
[2:45:20] done it my way a little too conveniently
[2:45:23] lately, and I must find your will, my
[2:45:28] why, my purpose, my reason. And so I
[2:45:31] surrender." So, Father, give grace where
[2:45:33] grace is needed.
[2:45:35] Give us wisdom
[2:45:37] so that if we have the opportunity to
[2:45:39] speak life to any of these who are
[2:45:42] making such a promise to you. May we use
[2:45:45] wisdom and may we do it with the
[2:45:47] wonderful grace that you have shown to
[2:45:49] us just once more. Lord, maybe there are
[2:45:54] those who feel like they have failed you
[2:45:56] too many times, let you down too many
[2:45:59] times,
[2:46:01] but I'm here to testify
[2:46:03] that you have such patience and such
[2:46:08] longsuffering
[2:46:11] that time and time again when we fail
[2:46:13] you, you still chase us after us. You
[2:46:17] still reach for us. So Lord, I ask you
[2:46:20] right now to remove all condemnation and
[2:46:23] judgment because there is therefore now
[2:46:25] no condemnation to them which are in
[2:46:27] Christ Jesus.
[2:46:31] Sin will condemn us, but your grace will
[2:46:34] set us free. And we ask you right now to
[2:46:38] come
[2:46:40] and break stubborn will
[2:46:43] and give us grace to be all that you
[2:46:46] have called us to be as we spend these
[2:46:49] next few moments worshiping our creator
[2:46:52] before we leave. Yes, [music] Jesus.
[2:47:15] All my words fall short.
[2:47:20] I've got nothing new.
[2:47:26] How could I express
[2:47:31] all my gratitude?
[2:47:37] I could sing these songs
[2:47:42] as I [singing] often do.
[2:47:47] that every song must stand
[2:47:52] and you never do.
[2:47:57] So I throw up my hands and praise you
[2:48:02] again and again.
[2:48:06] Cuz all that I have is a hallelujah.
[2:48:14] A hallelujah.
[2:48:19] And I know it's not much, but I've

[2:48:27] except for a heart singing hallelujah.
[2:48:35] Hallelujah.

[2:50:41] It's a hallelujah.
[2:50:46] And I know it's not much, but [music]

[3:04:07] All my days
[3:04:10] I've been held [singing] in your hands.
[3:04:16] Don't you just touch the the person next
[3:04:19] to you if it's if it's convenient or if
[3:04:22] it's appropriate or you know what I
[3:04:24] mean.
[3:04:26] Even if it embarrasses the life out of
[3:04:28] them, do it just one time.
[3:04:31] And just ask the Lord. You don't have to
[3:04:33] do it out loud, but just ask the Lord,
[3:04:34] would you strengthen this one? Maybe
[3:04:37] it's your companion.
[3:04:40] May maybe it's your own family,
[3:04:42] but would you just whisper, "Lord,
[3:04:44] strengthen this woman. You're the only
[3:04:46] one that can strengthen his." Yes.
[3:04:50] Strengthen her. Yes.
[3:04:53] Stir the desire and hunger for you,
[3:04:55] Lord, in this one I'm standing next to.
[3:04:59] Stir the hunger. Stir the desire.
[3:05:04] Let me set a better example. If it's
[3:05:07] someone in my home, let me set a better
[3:05:09] example for this one.
[3:05:14] We can't do it without you, Lord. And
[3:05:17] just to be honest, we need one another.
[3:05:19] Lord, we need one another. Brothers need
[3:05:22] brothers. Sisters need sisters. The body
[3:05:25] needs the body. And we just stand right
[3:05:28] now saying, "Lord, strengthen this one.
[3:05:40] Your goodness has followed us all the
[3:05:42] days of our life. And we don't want to
[3:05:44] finish in a in a rotten way. We want to
[3:05:47] finish well.
[3:05:50] If it's another few weeks or months or
[3:05:52] years or whatever it is that you've got
[3:05:54] left for us on this earth, we want to
[3:05:56] finish the race well.
[3:06:00] If we have slowed down, Lord, we want to
[3:06:02] pick up the pace
[3:06:04] and we want to get our eyes on the
[3:06:06] finish line. And the finish line is not
[3:06:07] a trophy. It's not even a mansion or a
[3:06:11] street of gold to walk on. It's you.
[3:06:14] You are the prize that lays before your
[3:06:17] little bride.
[3:06:19] And we want to say, Lord, you're more
[3:06:21] than enough.
[3:06:24] You're more than enough. If we can win
[3:06:26] you, if we can gain you as our prize,
[3:06:31] as our reward, you're more than enough.
[3:06:34] Just carry a moment with the one that
[3:06:36] you're standing near and take us back
[3:06:39] into that song.
[3:06:42] You just don't realize sometime how
[3:06:45] strengthening it is when you show just a
[3:06:49] little kindness to the one that's next
[3:06:51] to you.
[3:06:53] Strengthen this whole body. Strengthen
[3:06:55] the streamers today, Lord. Let your
[3:06:58] presence
[3:06:59] touch them right now in their homes. I
[3:07:03] looked a moment ago and they're
[3:07:04] streaming from the nations of the world.
[3:07:07] In Norway, in South Africa, in Iceland,
[3:07:10] all over the world, so many places.
[3:07:13] Strengthen them now.
[3:07:19] I love you, Lord.
[3:07:24] Oh, your mercy [singing]
[3:07:25] [music] never fails me.
[3:07:29] And all my [singing] days
[3:07:32] I've been held [music] in your hands.
[3:07:36] From the moment [singing] that I wake up
[3:07:40] until I lay my hand, [music and singing]
[3:07:44] I will sing of the goodness
[3:07:49] of God. [music and singing]
[3:07:53] Cuz all my life you have been faithful.
[3:08:01] And all my life you have been so so

[3:08:34] You are [singing] close like no other.
[3:08:39] I've known you as a father

[3:12:55] That I can say. Thank you. Thank you.
[3:12:57] Thank you for staying.
[3:13:00] What an honor to be in the presence of
[3:13:02] the Lord.
[3:13:05] On Tuesday night at six o'clock, we'll
[3:13:08] gather here to have a memorial service
[3:13:11] in honor of our dear sister Williams
[3:13:16] who has run her race.
[3:13:18] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[3:13:19] &gt;&gt; We're
[3:13:20] left here to continue the race. And by
[3:13:23] God's grace, that is what we are going
[3:13:25] to do. We're going to keep running the
[3:13:27] race.
[3:13:28] &gt;&gt; We'll gather together at six o'clock.
[3:13:30] And when we're finished, then we will
[3:13:33] gather to have a meal together down at
[3:13:36] the fellowship hall and
[3:13:40] give
[3:13:42] as much comfort as we can to the family
[3:13:45] as much as we know how as human beings
[3:13:48] and pray that the Lord will do what we
[3:13:51] cannot do. Let's bow our heads as we're
[3:13:54] getting ready to leave. Our father,
[3:13:58] how blessed we are to be in your
[3:14:00] presence today.
[3:14:04] We do live by faith,
[3:14:07] but we are thankful
[3:14:09] when you come by,
[3:14:13] when you let us know you're so close.
[3:14:18] Thank you that you quicken us.
[3:14:23] Thank you for the word of the Lord
[3:14:24] today. Thank you for each one that is
[3:14:27] gathered to be in the house and those
[3:14:29] that have been on the streaming today.
[3:14:31] We pray your blessing upon them, asking
[3:14:34] that the word that has been preached
[3:14:36] would uh continue its work through this
[3:14:40] week and and the the rest of our
[3:14:42] lifetime. Lord, I thank you that you are
[3:14:46] the one who is working mightily in us as
[3:14:49] we yield and say yes to you. Now, as we
[3:14:53] leave this house, we pray for those that
[3:14:56] would be traveling, some by air, some on
[3:14:59] the road. We pray that you would let the
[3:15:02] angels of the Lord surround them. I
[3:15:04] pray, God, for those that are traveling
[3:15:06] in for the memorial, that you'll be with
[3:15:08] them as they travel. And God, I pray
[3:15:11] that you will let the peace that passes
[3:15:13] all understanding rest upon us. We will
[3:15:17] give you glory and praise. Father, would
[3:15:20] you pour strength back into our pastor,
[3:15:22] minister into his into his physical
[3:15:25] frame? And I pray, God, that you will
[3:15:28] continue to lead him as he is trying to
[3:15:31] lead us on in the paths of
[3:15:33] righteousness. For your name's sake we
[3:15:36] give you glory and honor and praise. For
[3:15:39] it's in the name of the Lord Jesus
[3:15:41] Christ we pray. Amen.
[3:15:44] &gt;&gt; God bless you as you leave today. Greet
[3:15:47] one another.
[3:15:49] Let the love of Jesus
[3:15:52] shine out of you in the name of the
[3:15:55] Lord. Once again, we'll be together.
[3:15:59] Remember, it's at 6:00 Eastern time on
[3:16:02] Tuesday night, not 7:00 as our normal
[3:16:05] service time.
[3:16:10] Thank you to Sister Martha's family for
[3:16:13] those of you who stayed for the service
[3:16:15] today. We feel honored. Thank you for
[3:16:17] doing it. I know it touched her heart,
[3:16:20] too.
[3:16:22] Praise God. Go ahead.
[3:16:25] &gt;&gt; You have been faithful.
[3:16:31] All my life you have been so so good.
[3:16:40] With every breath that I am able,
[3:16:46] I will sing
[3:16:48] of the goodness
[3:16:50] of God.
[3:16:53] I love your voice. [singing]
[3:16:58] You have led me through the fire.
[3:17:03] And in darkest night, you are close like
[3:17:08] no other.
[3:17:11] I have [music] known you as a father,
[3:17:15] known you as a friend,
[3:17:18] and I have lived in the goodness of God.
[3:17:28] All my life you have been faithful.
[3:17:36] All my life you have been so so good.
[3:17:43] With every breath that I am aable,
[3:17:49] I will sing of the goodness.
