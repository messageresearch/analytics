[1:05:15] this weekend in Japan and we've already
[1:05:17] been praying for them that God will
[1:05:19] manifest himself there in a mighty way
[1:05:22] there are many many many people in Japan
[1:05:26] who don't know the gospel of the Lord
[1:05:28] Jesus Christ they've never even heard
[1:05:30] the Salvation message and so we we're
[1:05:34] thankful for the little group that is
[1:05:36] there and for the pastor that is there
[1:05:39] and he's a fine man of God and he's
[1:05:42] doing a wonderful job and we're very
[1:05:44] glad that they have a place that they
[1:05:46] can go and and fellowship we're we're
[1:05:50] blessed God sent them to us can you
[1:05:53] imagine you know getting a re ration
[1:05:56] that you should be baptized you're
[1:05:57] Japanese you're a Christian you haven't
[1:06:00] really had a a Full Gospel message
[1:06:03] presented to you and you hear it because
[1:06:06] of a newsletter that came to you from
[1:06:09] Jerusalem you hear about this little
[1:06:11] church in Alabama and you fly to the
[1:06:13] other side of the world to be baptized
[1:06:16] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:06:18] that's what sister IMO did with her
[1:06:20] daughter F and they were some of the
[1:06:23] very first Believers in the entire
[1:06:25] nation of Japan to accept this message
[1:06:29] there was no Fellowship going on before
[1:06:31] and we're thankful that there is now
[1:06:34] isn't God good he is so faithful I want
[1:06:38] to thank you all that uh many of you

[1:07:03] sister Terry knew I had lost a few
[1:07:05] pounds this
[1:07:07] week and she was determined to reverse
[1:07:11] it and she made look she's red I'm sorry
[1:07:15] I'm sorry I didn't mean to embarrass you
[1:07:17] like that and know bookmark leather and
[1:07:20] I've got all kinds of things thank you
[1:07:23] so much for thinking about me and uh and
[1:07:26] the and the and the love Gifts of of of
[1:07:29] offering of money too thank you I
[1:07:31] appreciate all that I want to brag on
[1:07:34] brother gley he's not here to hear it so
[1:07:36] it's easier to brag on him then but uh
[1:07:41] we we uh prayed for him Tuesday night
[1:07:44] and we asked the Lord to give him
[1:07:46] courage and boldness and to use him in a
[1:07:48] mighty way he is in Napoleon Ohio I
[1:07:53] don't know exactly where that is but
[1:07:55] Ohio is a big state and Napoleon is a
[1:07:58] long way from here I think it's probably
[1:08:01] 11 or 12 hours away and they drove and
[1:08:05] it was a new
[1:08:07] place um I think I may be the one that
[1:08:10] mentioned this church to him because I
[1:08:12] had listened to the pastor who was
[1:08:15] preaching a fine message on on the
[1:08:19] paganism of Christmas and of course that
[1:08:22] got the title got my attention and I
[1:08:25] hope that it wouldn't disappoint me and
[1:08:27] it did not it was an outstanding message
[1:08:30] I and so brother gy was going to be up
[1:08:32] that way last September and he went by
[1:08:34] there on a Wednesday night and just
[1:08:36] visited the church and so the pastor
[1:08:39] brother Cameron Smith invited him to
[1:08:42] come and preach well it dawned on me
[1:08:44] that that I have a subscription to their
[1:08:47] YouTube and uh I thought well maybe it
[1:08:51] will be live and so I'm sitting in my
[1:08:54] chair last night and I found brother
[1:08:57] gley preaching now he had already
[1:08:59] started preaching and I want you to know
[1:09:03] that he was doing an absolute
[1:09:07] outstanding job and the people I
[1:09:10] couldn't see all the congregation only
[1:09:13] the first few rows but the people were
[1:09:16] so responsive and were pulling on him
[1:09:19] and the harder they pulled the Bolder he
[1:09:24] got now I'm might not ought to say this
[1:09:27] but sister Joyce sent me a text and she
[1:09:29] knew immediately I sent brother gley a
[1:09:32] text and I said that was some fine
[1:09:34] preaching which surprised him he had no
[1:09:36] idea that I was listening sister Joyce
[1:09:39] asked an honest question and she might
[1:09:41] not have told him she
[1:09:43] did so now he will know she said be
[1:09:46] honest brother Shelly was there any time
[1:09:48] that you lost your breath anticipating
[1:09:51] how the crowd would receive what what
[1:09:54] Wes was saying and I said
[1:09:58] yes yes more than once I lost my breath
[1:10:03] I had to gasp to get more oxygen because
[1:10:07] I thought he is really pushing the
[1:10:11] envelope but he created such a hunger
[1:10:15] the Holy Ghost through him created such
[1:10:18] a Hunger for More Of God and he prayed
[1:10:21] for many after the service and I didn't
[1:10:24] get to see all of what was going going
[1:10:25] on some of it was off camera but your
[1:10:28] prayers I just wanted you to know your
[1:10:30] prayers for him were answered and I
[1:10:33] trust that God is doing outstanding
[1:10:35] things there this morning and I pray and
[1:10:38] and uh certainly hope that he will have
[1:10:41] another invitation
[1:10:43] back after the service was over brother
[1:10:46] gy made some statement in the preaching
[1:10:48] he said you know brother brandham tells
[1:10:50] us if you're eating Cherry Pie and you
[1:10:52] come to a seed or a pit he said you
[1:10:55] don't you don't discard the whole pie
[1:10:57] you just spit out the seed and uh that's
[1:11:01] right that's right and so when the
[1:11:04] pastor got up I always you know those
[1:11:07] few little speeches that those few words
[1:11:09] after an evangelist that the pastor
[1:11:12] speaks are very important words they're
[1:11:15] very heavy words and you can usually
[1:11:18] tell what the pastor's Thinking by what
[1:11:21] he says after did you all know that
[1:11:28] so the pastor got up and he and he
[1:11:30] bragged on it and he said I couldn't
[1:11:32] find one seed to spit out it was nothing
[1:11:39] but the
[1:11:42] truth I appreciate
[1:11:45] that I appreciate the Lord using our
[1:11:48] brother amen he's a blessing to us and I
[1:11:52] appreciate the Lord using him that way
[1:11:54] and we want to give all the glory and
[1:11:56] the honor to the Lord let's stand
[1:12:06] again I think that's it I I almost could
[1:12:10] but let let's let that be the music why
[1:12:13] don't we give these musicians a great
[1:12:15] thank
[1:12:16] [Applause]
[1:12:22] you hallelujah amen amen are you ready
[1:12:27] yes let's go to Acts chapter
[1:12:31] 17 and we're going to read verses
[1:12:36] 23 through
[1:12:38] 30 acts chap 17 verses 23 through
[1:12:50] 30 for as I pass by and be held your
[1:12:57] devotions I found an altar with this
[1:13:01] inscription to the unknown God whom
[1:13:06] therefore ye ignorantly worship Him
[1:13:10] declare I unto
[1:13:13] you God that made the world and all
[1:13:18] things therein seeing that he is Lord of
[1:13:23] Heaven and Earth
[1:13:25] dwelleth not in temples made with hands
[1:13:32] can you say
[1:13:34] Amen neither is worshiped with men's
[1:13:38] hands as though he needed
[1:13:42] anything seeing he giveth to all
[1:13:47] life and
[1:13:49] breath and all what does all mean all
[1:13:55] all means all a l
[1:13:59] all God has G that's all God is giving
[1:14:02] to us all life and breath and all
[1:14:08] things all and haveth made of one blood
[1:14:12] this is powerful
[1:14:16] transfusion one
[1:14:18] blood whether you're African or North
[1:14:22] American whether you're European or
[1:14:25] asan come on you a as a Believer you are
[1:14:31] you have received a blood
[1:14:34] transfusion and now the blood that is
[1:14:37] flowing through your veins is divine
[1:14:40] blood it is the blood of the Lamb God
[1:14:44] hath made of one blood all nations of
[1:14:47] men for to dwell on all the face of the
[1:14:52] Earth and hath determined the times
[1:14:57] before appointed and the
[1:15:00] bounds of their
[1:15:03] habitation now this is an interesting
[1:15:06] verse of scripture because it boldly
[1:15:10] decrees and declares the sovereignty of
[1:15:15] God I want you to know God is Sovereign
[1:15:19] we serve a God who is more powerful than
[1:15:23] his enemy he's more powerful than luck
[1:15:27] he's more powerful than
[1:15:29] fate God is
[1:15:32] Sovereign he has made of one blood all
[1:15:35] nations of the earth those who have been
[1:15:38] born from above and then the next verse
[1:15:43] that they should seek the Lord if
[1:15:47] happily they might
[1:15:50] feel after him
[1:15:57] feelings don't
[1:16:00] matter they do
[1:16:02] matter feeling a feel after him and find
[1:16:07] him though he be not
[1:16:11] far from every one of us what a
[1:16:15] paradox many have spent years searching
[1:16:19] for the Lord finally finding him he was
[1:16:23] right there all all the
[1:16:26] time it was not until our eyes were open
[1:16:30] that we could see him now I want you to
[1:16:33] pay very careful attention to verse 28
[1:16:37] for in
[1:16:40] him for in him we
[1:16:45] live in him we live say that with me in
[1:16:48] him we live and move and
[1:16:53] move and and have our
[1:16:59] being our
[1:17:01] existence is in
[1:17:03] him my daily life is in him my daily
[1:17:08] bread my provision is in him my breath
[1:17:13] is in him everything that I have is
[1:17:16] found because I am in him for in him we
[1:17:21] live and move and have our being
[1:17:25] as certain also of your Poets of your
[1:17:28] own poets have said for we are
[1:17:32] also his
[1:17:36] offspring what a
[1:17:38] word what a
[1:17:41] revelation we are sons of God we are of
[1:17:46] his
[1:17:48] seed remember the Bible said and his
[1:17:51] seed remaineth in them that they cannot
[1:17:54] not
[1:17:55] sin that word seed is is the Sperma that
[1:18:00] we were talking about in Greek you have
[1:18:03] in you by the New Birth the very Sperma
[1:18:07] the very life seed of God and Satan can
[1:18:11] never take that from you never your
[1:18:15] enemies can never take that from you and
[1:18:18] it's not something that you can ever
[1:18:21] lose
[1:18:23] right once that spermac seed of God is
[1:18:26] in you we won't talk about how it gets
[1:18:29] there that's quite a debatable subject
[1:18:32] this morning and one for another time
[1:18:35] but once that Sperma of God life of God
[1:18:38] seed of God is in you you can never lose
[1:18:42] it there's nothing to replace
[1:18:49] it pretty
[1:18:51] powerful for as much then as we are The
[1:18:55] Offspring of God we ought not to think
[1:18:59] that the godhead is like unto gold or
[1:19:02] silver or stone Graven by Art and man's
[1:19:08] device and the time at and the times of
[1:19:12] this ignorance God winked at but now
[1:19:17] commandeth all men
[1:19:20] everywhere to
[1:19:22] repent not knowing who God is used to be
[1:19:27] an offense that God winked at but no
[1:19:32] longer because the full revelation of
[1:19:34] who God is has come to planet Earth and
[1:19:38] because it has visited us one generation
[1:19:41] ago ignorance is no longer tolerated by
[1:19:46] God now if that's the case then it's
[1:19:49] God's responsibility to get the word to
[1:19:53] those people he uses
[1:19:56] men he uses men but if there's anybody
[1:19:59] out there that has not yet had an
[1:20:01] opportunity it's up to God he's
[1:20:05] Sovereign to get that word to them may
[1:20:07] God add his Blessing to the reading of
[1:20:09] his word you may be seated for in him we
[1:20:15] live and
[1:20:17] move verse 28 and have our being as
[1:20:24] certain also of your own prophets have
[1:20:27] said for we are also his
[1:20:33] offspring the life of Messiah is in US
[1:20:39] hello and so therefore we have been
[1:20:46] Messiah it's a translation of the Greek
[1:20:50] you have been Anointed with messiah's
[1:20:54] anointing
[1:20:55] Amen brother brandom tells us clearly
[1:20:58] the anointing is a
[1:21:00] person
[1:21:02] powerful it's a person it's the only
[1:21:06] person of the
[1:21:07] godhead well I thought that was Jesus it
[1:21:12] is the anointing is a person it's not a
[1:21:17] feeling when you have had fellowship
[1:21:20] with the person you're going to feel
[1:21:23] something
[1:21:25] this quickening power this unction from
[1:21:28] the Holy One will Quicken your mortal
[1:21:31] body in time of Resurrection it will
[1:21:34] Quicken your mortal body when you sit
[1:21:36] under the revealed word it will Quicken
[1:21:39] your mortal body when you come to praise
[1:21:42] and worship him and create an atmosphere
[1:21:45] for Jesus Christ to come and prove
[1:21:48] himself to be the same today yesterday
[1:21:52] today and forever
[1:21:55] so it's not just some smoke the
[1:21:58] anointing is not just a cloud it's not
[1:22:01] just a haze in the room the anointing is
[1:22:05] a person and you have received of the
[1:22:08] Holy Spirit the anointing of the Messiah
[1:22:12] the anointing of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:22:15] and therefore you are an offspring of
[1:22:19] almighty God now that's what the word I
[1:22:23] just read I didn't read that from the
[1:22:24] message book I read that from the
[1:22:27] Bible you are also his offspring you are
[1:22:32] right now right now though not fully
[1:22:35] expressed though not fully manifested
[1:22:39] you right now are an offspring of God
[1:22:45] right now right now say right now I am a
[1:22:50] manifested Son of God somebody say well
[1:22:54] what if there's no manifestation in my
[1:22:56] life are you
[1:22:57] here are you here are you living in 2024
[1:23:02] then you've been
[1:23:03] [Music]
[1:23:05] manifested you've been manifested you
[1:23:08] were once a thought in the mind of God
[1:23:11] he spoke you into
[1:23:14] existence it was not your mother and
[1:23:16] father they provided the DNA and the
[1:23:19] genetics that form the flesh body that
[1:23:22] you're living in but the reality of who
[1:23:24] you really are it's not found in mortal
[1:23:27] flesh it's not in the
[1:23:30] DNA it's not in the genetic code of your
[1:23:33] life it's found in the inner man it's
[1:23:37] that breath that God breathed into Adam
[1:23:41] and made that's Spirit New Testament
[1:23:44] Numa that is Greek and it is breath it
[1:23:48] is the air of God it is the Breath of
[1:23:51] God he breathed that breath into our
[1:23:54] Adam and Adam was no longer just a flesh
[1:23:57] body he was now a flesh body that
[1:24:01] contained The Very Spirit the very
[1:24:04] breath of almighty God as soon as that
[1:24:08] breath came into his flesh body he was
[1:24:11] then given a soul and that Soul remember
[1:24:15] and Man became a living Soul he was once
[1:24:19] just a body of Flesh stay with me then
[1:24:23] Spirit was breathed in to him and when
[1:24:26] Spirit entered into flesh Adam would
[1:24:29] have had no way of contacting his
[1:24:34] environment his physical body would have
[1:24:37] given him five senses and he could have
[1:24:40] contacted his environment around him
[1:24:43] physically through the five senses but
[1:24:45] that's not the environment we're talking
[1:24:47] about we're talking about the glory
[1:24:49] realm we're talking about the spirit
[1:24:52] realm and so God gave him that ability
[1:24:56] then to create uh to contact both
[1:25:00] Physical Realm and also the spiritual
[1:25:03] realm that was no longer in heaven it
[1:25:07] was now living inside of him then the
[1:25:09] fall came and his Spirit was fallen and
[1:25:13] his Spirit would have need to be
[1:25:17] regenerated or redeemed you are unlike
[1:25:20] Adam in this sense you came here with
[1:25:24] with a fallen
[1:25:27] Spirit you came here with an adamic
[1:25:30] nature you and every other Generation
[1:25:33] all the way back to Adam came to this
[1:25:36] Earth with a fallen spirit and a fallen
[1:25:40] nature dwelling and reigning in your
[1:25:44] flesh you and I had to come to the New
[1:25:47] Birth and in that new birth the the very
[1:25:51] Holy Ghost of God the very Zoe the the
[1:25:54] life of God was transferred into us by
[1:25:58] the new birth what did we do we
[1:26:02] repented we repented of our sin we were
[1:26:05] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:26:08] Christ we were filled with the Holy
[1:26:10] Ghost and now the very Breath of God the
[1:26:13] life of God breathed into us in the New
[1:26:17] Birth it went right into the Fallen
[1:26:19] Spirit it went right into the Fallen
[1:26:22] part of who we were and reject generated
[1:26:25] us can you imagine when Spirit dies it's
[1:26:28] dead but when God breathes into Fallen
[1:26:32] Spirit it is now recreated in the new
[1:26:36] birth and it comes forth
[1:26:40] whole and it's just like what lives in
[1:26:43] you and I it's just like the life that
[1:26:46] Adam received of God in the garden are
[1:26:49] you with me well then why don't I this
[1:26:52] and why don't I that and why why don't I
[1:26:54] other because we're on a
[1:26:57] journey we are a tripartate man and
[1:27:01] every part of us must be redeemed back
[1:27:05] to the father's original thoughts about
[1:27:08] us we must have a redeemed and
[1:27:11] regenerated Spirit we must have a
[1:27:13] redeemed and regenerated soul and one
[1:27:17] day we must have a regenerated and
[1:27:20] redeemed body then we have what John G
[1:27:24] call full
[1:27:26] salvation we understand that you can
[1:27:29] have the Holy Spirit on your flesh and
[1:27:33] you can dance and you can run and you
[1:27:36] can jump and you can talk in tongues and
[1:27:39] brother brandom said you can be
[1:27:43] lost he said you can go straight to
[1:27:47] hell now I know Pentecostal theology
[1:27:50] struggles with that because they think
[1:27:53] once somebody talk in tongues they've
[1:27:55] reached the
[1:27:56] Pinnacle but it's possible to talk in
[1:28:00] tongues with just an anointing falling
[1:28:03] on your
[1:28:04] flesh but there is an
[1:28:07] anointing that's deeper than that it's
[1:28:11] the indwelling presence of almighty God
[1:28:14] it's the life of Jesus Christ Living in
[1:28:17] The Believer it's the anointing of the
[1:28:19] Messiah and once we have that then in
[1:28:22] him in him we live the life that I now
[1:28:27] live the Apostle said is not my own life
[1:28:32] I'm living messiah's life oh how
[1:28:35] important that is it's not only
[1:28:38] important for it to happen it's
[1:28:40] important for us to know that it has
[1:28:42] happened it's important for us to
[1:28:44] testify that it has happened it's
[1:28:47] important for us to live like it has
[1:28:51] happened right hello
[1:28:55] wow I think I'm going to preach about
[1:28:58] three hours
[1:29:02] today if I do it won't be based on your
[1:29:04] amens cuz they're a little
[1:29:06] lacking I'm going to say like they say
[1:29:09] in Ghana you need to sanctify your amen
[1:29:12] your amen needs to get
[1:29:14] saved when we understand through this
[1:29:18] message what God has done on the inside
[1:29:22] of us we we are compelled we are
[1:29:26] behooved we are moved upon to live a
[1:29:30] different ordered life we can't follow
[1:29:34] after the flesh it will never let me
[1:29:37] tell you something if you're depending
[1:29:39] on your flesh to get you to church on
[1:29:42] Sunday you'll never come if you're
[1:29:45] depending on your flesh to give you the
[1:29:47] want to to pay your tithe you'll never
[1:29:52] pay your tithe if you're to depending on
[1:29:54] the flesh to cause you to be kind and do
[1:29:57] good deeds for one another it's not
[1:30:00] likely that's going to happen because
[1:30:02] this flesh has a nature and that nature
[1:30:06] is not running after God but you have
[1:30:09] another nature one that's on the inside
[1:30:12] of you one that's the real who you are
[1:30:15] and that nature will lead your soul to
[1:30:18] the things of God if you will continue
[1:30:21] to feed and strengthen your regeneration
[1:30:24] spirit and we do that on the Living Word
[1:30:28] we don't do that on the dead preaching
[1:30:30] of YouTube we don't do that on this
[1:30:33] Doctrine and that Doctrine and the other
[1:30:35] Doctrine hello we don't do that by
[1:30:37] listening to this one and that one and
[1:30:39] the other one who preach all kinds of
[1:30:41] things because the modern church has
[1:30:43] lost their
[1:30:44] mind we stick with the revealed word of
[1:30:47] the hour we hear it we feed on it we
[1:30:50] bask on it and we are changed by it that
[1:30:54] doesn't mean that somebody out there
[1:30:55] doesn't say something good that can
[1:30:57] inspire you but there's only one word to
[1:31:01] dress
[1:31:02] you and that's the revealed word this
[1:31:05] bride is not going to be dressed in
[1:31:07] denominational
[1:31:10] sermons she's not going to be dressed on
[1:31:12] denominational YouTube
[1:31:14] clips she's going to only be D oh it's
[1:31:18] quiet she's only going to be dressed in
[1:31:21] the revealed word of God God went to a
[1:31:23] lot of trouble to get this truth to
[1:31:26] us and we should value it we should
[1:31:31] value it with everything that is within
[1:31:34] us the New Testament reveals to us that
[1:31:37] Christ is you know when we read
[1:31:41] scripture for surface it sounds like
[1:31:44] that Christ is the head and we alone are
[1:31:49] the
[1:31:50] body and we must depend on the neck
[1:31:54] to connect us but we don't take one
[1:31:58] scripture we don't take one
[1:32:02] quote we take them all and when we take
[1:32:06] them all we find out that Christ is not
[1:32:09] only the head but he's also represented
[1:32:12] himself in the
[1:32:15] body we're not depending on a neck to
[1:32:18] connect us we're depending on messiah's
[1:32:22] life to connect us
[1:32:24] and we are connected to the head so
[1:32:27] Christ messia the anointed one is
[1:32:31] represented both in the head and in the
[1:32:34] body now Jesus technically is our head
[1:32:38] we make up the body but remember as the
[1:32:41] bride church we have messiah's anointing
[1:32:45] not just on our
[1:32:47] flesh but in
[1:32:49] us all the way in hello hello all the
[1:32:54] way in not just a surface thing a
[1:32:57] feeling a
[1:32:59] goosebump a jump or a hoop or a holler
[1:33:02] but something that causes us to walk
[1:33:05] different and talk different and live
[1:33:08] different and dress
[1:33:11] different we listen to different music
[1:33:15] than what the world listens to we get
[1:33:17] our high in a different way than how the
[1:33:19] world gets their High hello we get our
[1:33:23] thrill in a different way than how the
[1:33:25] world gets their thrill there's
[1:33:27] something wrong with you if you're
[1:33:29] always looking to The World To Thrill
[1:33:31] you the greatest thrill that any man or
[1:33:34] woman could ever have is to come in
[1:33:37] contact with the precious power of the
[1:33:40] Holy Ghost now that'll thrill you
[1:33:43] brother and it's not just an emotional
[1:33:45] thrill it's a thrill that changes it's a
[1:33:49] transforming Thrill is anybody hearing
[1:33:51] the preacher it transforms Ms us from
[1:33:55] glory to glory from Faith to Faith from
[1:33:58] strength to strength so when we put the
[1:34:00] head Christ and the body Christ
[1:34:06] together when we see by the word head
[1:34:11] joined to the body then together we form
[1:34:16] the corporate
[1:34:19] Messiah the Messiah hasn't
[1:34:22] gone he didn't leave the Earth remember
[1:34:26] what he said when he was leaving I'm
[1:34:28] going to come to
[1:34:30] you you're going to have to let my flesh
[1:34:32] body
[1:34:34] go we like to hold on to people we like
[1:34:37] to hold on to flesh we find Comfort when
[1:34:41] we meet a god with skin on him we find
[1:34:44] comfort in that whether it's our mother
[1:34:46] or our preacher or our wife or our
[1:34:49] husband or whatever it is when we find
[1:34:51] somebody who has God living in them and
[1:34:55] we can feel and experience God in that
[1:34:58] person's life we want to hold on to them
[1:35:01] forever Jesus said it is expedient for
[1:35:04] you it is totally necessary anybody here
[1:35:09] it is totally necessary for you that I
[1:35:12] go away because if I do not go away what
[1:35:16] I
[1:35:17] carry what's on the inside of me cannot
[1:35:20] fall on you there can't be but one of us
[1:35:23] here at a time one body but if I take my
[1:35:27] body
[1:35:30] elsewhere then there'll be a new
[1:35:33] body for messiah hear me there will be a
[1:35:37] new body for messiah to live in and it
[1:35:42] won't be a one man body it won't be just
[1:35:45] a prophet's body it won't be just a
[1:35:47] pastor's body it won't be just a faith
[1:35:50] healer's body it'll be a many membered
[1:35:53] body
[1:35:54] it'll be your body and my body and your
[1:35:57] body and your body and your body and
[1:36:01] that makes up corporate
[1:36:04] Messiah he's now corporate he's now
[1:36:08] living in a many membered body
[1:36:11] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:36:14] hallelujah I feel like so many times we
[1:36:17] work so hard to convince you of what's
[1:36:20] living inside of you because you're Fe
[1:36:23] feelings will tell you other things your
[1:36:26] feelings will magnify any unbelief
[1:36:29] that's left in you or any area of your
[1:36:32] life where you still need a change how
[1:36:35] many of you have some place in your life
[1:36:37] that you still need a
[1:36:39] change and you know what that's all
[1:36:42] right nothing wrong with
[1:36:44] that you're here you're in the right
[1:36:50] atmosphere look lately I've been getting
[1:36:53] test monies from people who didn't have
[1:36:55] hands laid on
[1:36:57] them and God met their
[1:37:01] need now that is in the presence of
[1:37:04] corporate Messiah when you get plugged
[1:37:07] into a body where messiah's living then
[1:37:10] you don't necessarily have to line up
[1:37:12] and do it the oldfashioned
[1:37:15] way didn't he tell us that that new
[1:37:18] ministry was coming and under that new
[1:37:21] anointing we wouldn't have to be prayed
[1:37:23] for like Methodist and always having
[1:37:26] hands laid on
[1:37:28] us now don't you misunderstand me I am
[1:37:33] 110% for prayer
[1:37:36] lines I've been recently hearing sermons
[1:37:40] against prayer lines may I just humbly
[1:37:44] say that is
[1:37:50] stupid that's not the spirit of God
[1:37:54] that's the spirit of
[1:37:59] stupid and you just let that person have
[1:38:02] a
[1:38:04] need you just let people who don't
[1:38:06] believe in that have a problem and
[1:38:09] they're going to ask somebody to pray
[1:38:11] for them and there some of them aren't
[1:38:14] going to be happy if you don't lay your
[1:38:15] hand on them right they want that
[1:38:18] contact laying on of hands is not
[1:38:21] necessary but how many of you no it's a
[1:38:24] way that God has chosen to move and it's
[1:38:27] a point of
[1:38:29] contact what it is it's messiah in you
[1:38:32] contacting
[1:38:34] [Music]
[1:38:36] messiah in somebody else we have called
[1:38:40] it here Spirit to Spirit
[1:38:43] Fellowship too much Fellowship takes
[1:38:47] place in the realm of
[1:38:49] Flesh anybody with
[1:38:51] me just flesh just getting together in
[1:38:54] the flesh talking about
[1:38:57] [Music]
[1:39:00] ball talking about this
[1:39:07] golf now it's pickle
[1:39:11] ball next month it'll be something
[1:39:16] else for an old-fashioned Church we're
[1:39:18] sure a trendy Church
[1:39:24] for a while it was drones and and model
[1:39:27] cars and oh airsoft
[1:39:31] guns everybody shooting one
[1:39:35] another I I'll be honest I can
[1:39:38] understand why that would be a stress
[1:39:42] relief cuz you know it wasn't a bullet
[1:39:44] it was just it was just going to stun
[1:39:47] them let them know you were out there
[1:39:50] none of these things are wrong nothing
[1:39:52] it's not wrong folks to have some kind
[1:39:55] of of Outlet or or entertainment or
[1:39:59] something like that but if you get
[1:40:01] together and that's all you talk
[1:40:04] about then your soul your flesh is going
[1:40:07] to be gratified and your soul is going
[1:40:09] to be
[1:40:10] strengthened soul is mind will and
[1:40:13] emotion if you get together and all you
[1:40:15] talk about is how she hurt your feelings
[1:40:18] and how you're rejected and your kids
[1:40:20] never invited and
[1:40:27] that's going to talize the Flesh and
[1:40:30] feed the
[1:40:32] soul it's going to make your soul a sumo
[1:40:36] wrestler your mind is going to get fat
[1:40:39] your will is going to get fat your
[1:40:41] emotions are going to get fat and the
[1:40:43] spirit man on remember I know there
[1:40:46] message Believers lising this that
[1:40:48] believe that we've reversed the order so
[1:40:50] please just apply everything we say to
[1:40:53] to the spirit about the spirit in your
[1:40:56] in your uh Paradigm as soul and vice
[1:40:59] versa but when I read scripture I find
[1:41:03] that the order of things is Body Soul
[1:41:05] and Spirit and so don't don't be upset
[1:41:09] because I've called it something
[1:41:10] differently see it as you would normally
[1:41:13] see it regardless of what it's called
[1:41:16] the soul that middle part of who you are
[1:41:19] or the spirit if that's your Doctrine is
[1:41:22] mine will
[1:41:23] and emotions and it will desire to eat
[1:41:28] up and draw strength from everything
[1:41:32] around
[1:41:34] you it stirs up competition and
[1:41:40] emulation it stirs up smack
[1:41:44] talk it stirs up selfish ambition
[1:41:48] instead of spiritual desire did you know
[1:41:51] there are some people who think they're
[1:41:52] following us a desire of the spirit and
[1:41:55] really they're underneath a selfish
[1:41:58] ambition they're looking to build a
[1:42:00] Ministry for a name or for a
[1:42:04] reputation they they they do it in the
[1:42:07] Name of Christ but Christ is not
[1:42:10] glorified do you understand if you're
[1:42:14] going to feed the spirit man the spirit
[1:42:16] man is very
[1:42:18] finicky it doesn't discern scores
[1:42:23] it doesn't discern
[1:42:25] Heroes it doesn't discern
[1:42:32] superheroes it doesn't discern hippie
[1:42:38] talk it doesn't pick up those things the
[1:42:42] spirit only feeds on the revealed
[1:42:46] word sir why because that's what it was
[1:42:49] born from remember we have heard that we
[1:42:53] have a word
[1:42:57] birth remember the anointing is a person
[1:43:00] and the person is the word manifested so
[1:43:03] they're one in the same you were born by
[1:43:06] the spirit of the word by the spirit of
[1:43:11] the word by the spirit because of the
[1:43:16] word how many of you have had a word
[1:43:20] birth then the only thing that will feed
[1:43:23] that in your life is the revealed word
[1:43:27] if you'll let the spirit man get
[1:43:31] fat if you'll let the word that part of
[1:43:34] you the word part of you begin to grow
[1:43:37] it will become the sumo
[1:43:39] wrestler and it'll take care of the
[1:43:42] stick
[1:43:43] man if you starve your
[1:43:49] emotions W I'm not off of page one
[1:43:54] you've got to starve your
[1:43:55] emotions how do you do that by
[1:43:58] understanding what he said what does
[1:44:07] feelings believe I'll just have a little
[1:44:09] water
[1:44:14] here well I feel well I feel well I feel
[1:44:17] well she made me feel well he made me
[1:44:20] feel well I always feel feel feel
[1:44:23] feel if you're going to feel you need to
[1:44:26] feel after
[1:44:29] God don't feel after the
[1:44:32] emotions if you let your emotions reach
[1:44:35] out listen if you wear your feelings I'm
[1:44:37] going to call names in a
[1:44:39] minute if you let your feelings lead you
[1:44:43] and you always wear them on your
[1:44:51] sleeve they'll get knocked
[1:44:54] off there's some of us who are gifted in
[1:44:58] it and we will surely knock them off
[1:45:02] then you'll cut us
[1:45:07] off because people don't want
[1:45:11] [Music]
[1:45:13] relationship because relationship is
[1:45:15] give and
[1:45:18] take they want somebody who will yes yes
[1:45:22] that's right you're you're right you're
[1:45:24] right
[1:45:27] oh they want a
[1:45:29] sympathizer and that's not what
[1:45:31] relationship does relationship is not
[1:45:34] about enabling
[1:45:37] somebody to starve their Spirit
[1:45:42] man relationship is about sometimes
[1:45:45] speaking the truth in
[1:45:51] love we gravitate ha toward people who
[1:45:54] are
[1:45:59] non-confrontational because we don't
[1:46:01] want anybody to tell us like we
[1:46:07] are we like yes men and yes women around
[1:46:10] us come on talk to us holy
[1:46:14] ghost but relationship is made up of
[1:46:18] those who will also say
[1:46:26] now you are acting like the rear end of
[1:46:30] a
[1:46:32] horse and everybody sees
[1:46:40] you and then that person will go into
[1:46:44] hiding cut you
[1:46:47] off decide that you were out to destroy
[1:46:51] them and instead
[1:46:54] of
[1:46:56] recognizing that you may have been
[1:47:07] manifesting a
[1:47:09] hores rear
[1:47:12] end a a mule
[1:47:15] religion like brother brandom talked
[1:47:17] about you see I I love amens I need
[1:47:20] amens but I'm more interested in in in
[1:47:24] somebody that'll hear it and work on it
[1:47:28] than somebody that'll just
[1:47:31] heaw a mule can only heaw but a
[1:47:35] thoroughbred horse can get to the Finish
[1:47:37] Line how many of you plan to get to the
[1:47:40] Finish
[1:47:41] Line you're not going to be a hot house
[1:47:45] plant that has to be babied all the
[1:47:48] time woo I knew the I knew I know how
[1:47:53] this goes
[1:47:54] over it flies like a lead
[1:47:59] balloon but it's the truth it's the
[1:48:02] truth every time we wear our feelings on
[1:48:05] Our Sleeve someone pokes
[1:48:07] it then it just fluffs up the mind and
[1:48:11] the will and the emotions and and and it
[1:48:14] convinces us that that we were
[1:48:17] right and we carry because of that an
[1:48:20] orphan spirit
[1:48:24] you're no longer an
[1:48:26] orphan you are an
[1:48:28] offspring of God I'm counting on some of
[1:48:33] you who struggle with who you are to say
[1:48:40] Amen we are
[1:48:43] offspring of God we are dwelling with
[1:48:47] Christ as corporate messiah in the earth
[1:48:52] and we're feeding that part of us on the
[1:48:55] revealed word of the hour and when the
[1:48:57] spirit of man that regenerated spirit
[1:49:00] it's now not man's life but the life of
[1:49:03] God when it begins to
[1:49:06] swell it starts talking not only to your
[1:49:09] soul your mind will and your emotion it
[1:49:11] starts commanding the
[1:49:16] flesh oh that is the control
[1:49:19] tower that's where control ised supposed
[1:49:22] to come from the regenerated Spirit man
[1:49:27] then it tells your mind you
[1:49:29] behave it tells your will submit to God
[1:49:33] it tells your emotions calm
[1:49:37] down stop looking for somebody to agree
[1:49:41] with you and
[1:49:45] repent kill that
[1:49:47] thing you've got another seed living in
[1:49:50] you kill it
[1:49:53] dig it up by the
[1:49:55] root if jealousy is there dig it
[1:50:01] up nobody can be you but you and you're
[1:50:07] a fine
[1:50:09] you you're a valuable
[1:50:13] you you're an offspring of God yet there
[1:50:18] is not another one just like you
[1:50:23] you don't have to be like somebody
[1:50:27] else you don't have to worship like
[1:50:30] somebody else or preach like somebody
[1:50:32] else or play music like somebody else
[1:50:36] don't settle for being a copy of someone
[1:50:39] else that's an
[1:50:41] imitation the
[1:50:43] original God doesn't make
[1:50:50] junk you carry the Sperma of God in you
[1:50:53] act like it live like
[1:50:57] it talk like
[1:50:59] it we are dwelling with him as corporate
[1:51:05] Messiah it's
[1:51:07] powerful it's
[1:51:09] glorious it's not all easy that's right
[1:51:13] but it gives us what we need to
[1:51:17] overcome in the message Oneness I'm
[1:51:21] going to need some more honey sorry
[1:51:29] bring me another Leng
[1:51:33] too he said and if you'll notice how
[1:51:38] that Eve was United with
[1:51:41] Adam she became part of him God did you
[1:51:46] notice in Genesis 1: 127 he created man
[1:51:51] singular
[1:51:53] male and female thank you
[1:51:56] plural he created man male and female
[1:52:01] created he them plural now the man was
[1:52:05] both male and female when it come to
[1:52:09] being in the spirit of feminis and
[1:52:13] masculine do you understand that Adam
[1:52:16] was created with every attribute of God
[1:52:19] in him by the spirit life and therefore
[1:52:23] he had both the attributes of
[1:52:27] masculinity and the attributes of
[1:52:32] femininity obviously some people haven't
[1:52:35] had that
[1:52:41] separated and so they have gender
[1:52:45] confusion they're not identifying who
[1:52:47] they are by the
[1:52:49] plumbing they're identifying who they
[1:52:51] are by feelings
[1:52:53] well feelings can't be
[1:52:57] trusted so God God knows what he's doing
[1:53:01] he gives the right Plumbing for the
[1:53:04] right part part of who you are masculine
[1:53:08] or
[1:53:11] feminine Adam had both the Bible said
[1:53:14] male and female he created he them but
[1:53:17] there was only one so
[1:53:18] far then God uh then the body part
[1:53:22] listen this is important because he says
[1:53:25] it here in a way that should be noted
[1:53:28] the body part of the woman was a
[1:53:33] byproduct now what we often hear people
[1:53:36] quoting is a woman is a
[1:53:38] byproduct that's not what he said not
[1:53:42] here here he said the body part now what
[1:53:46] part of a tripart man or woman is that
[1:53:49] the body part what's what is that is
[1:53:51] that Soul or spirit Spirit or flesh so
[1:53:55] the flesh part of who Eve was was a
[1:53:59] byproduct because it came from the
[1:54:03] man after the creation had been finished
[1:54:09] God made Adam both and then he reached
[1:54:13] into Adam just like Christ was
[1:54:17] both he hung there on the cross
[1:54:21] bridegroom
[1:54:24] and
[1:54:25] bride bride was separated from him
[1:54:30] through a narrow
[1:54:31] way bride comes back into
[1:54:36] Christ through a narrow way that's right
[1:54:39] we're no longer separated from him we're
[1:54:42] now in him and how did we get there it's
[1:54:45] a narrow way it's a spirit
[1:54:50] walk not a flesh walk not a soul walk
[1:54:53] not mind will and emotion it's a spirit
[1:54:56] walk amen so so then God reaches in and
[1:55:01] he takes out the the Genesis says a
[1:55:05] rib and yet man has the same amount of
[1:55:08] ribs that a woman has but evidently in
[1:55:12] the beginning Adam had another
[1:55:16] one well I just don't know oh don't let
[1:55:19] that throw
[1:55:20] you God had to get her done he reached
[1:55:24] inside of Adam he took that rib he
[1:55:28] fashioned a woman and therefore the the
[1:55:31] body the flesh body was a
[1:55:35] byproduct it came from the man but I
[1:55:40] want you to know the life that was in
[1:55:42] her wasn't a
[1:55:44] byproduct the life that was in her was a
[1:55:48] portion of original
[1:55:50] life Spirit life
[1:55:53] so her body
[1:55:55] testifies of the fact that she was the
[1:56:03] weaker and it's supposed to I'm going to
[1:56:07] preach a little bit here it's supposed
[1:56:09] to she's not supposed to want to look
[1:56:12] like Mrs
[1:56:15] Atlas she's not supposed to want to work
[1:56:18] out and have I'm not saying she's not
[1:56:20] supposed to work out that's all right
[1:56:21] you you EX decd to burn fat but you
[1:56:24] don't work out ladies to have shoulders
[1:56:27] like a
[1:56:30] man you don't work out to have biceps
[1:56:34] like a
[1:56:35] man you work out to burn fat and to be
[1:56:38] healthy and to stay fit if you ever let
[1:56:40] that Spirit get on
[1:56:45] you that you think you've got to look
[1:56:47] like a man you see those female
[1:56:51] bodybuilders are a little bit
[1:56:56] disgusting your body as a woman
[1:56:59] testifies that you were created to be a
[1:57:01] weaker vessel but remember that's your
[1:57:04] body that's your flesh but there is a
[1:57:08] part of you that is not
[1:57:13] byproduct and there is a part of you oh
[1:57:15] this is going to O somebody's going to
[1:57:17] cringe there's a part of you that is
[1:57:20] indeed not weaker
[1:57:24] [Music]
[1:57:26] not
[1:57:28] weaker that Spirit life in you is not to
[1:57:32] be weaker because you're a
[1:57:37] woman that's not a
[1:57:39] byproduct that's original life
[1:57:43] hello and so you can have as much of the
[1:57:46] Holy Ghost as anybody can and you should
[1:57:52] and you should go for more so you can
[1:57:55] live with
[1:57:59] him that's right I thought I'd get a
[1:58:01] little more help you should get more of
[1:58:04] the Holy Ghost sisters so you can live
[1:58:07] with
[1:58:12] him so weaker body but you let the life
[1:58:16] of Jesus Christ breathe on that seed of
[1:58:19] God and let it come forth in gene form
[1:58:23] like him that's not weaker that's not a
[1:58:27] byproduct it's messiah's life it's
[1:58:30] messiah's anointing are you still with
[1:58:33] me that then God took from his side a
[1:58:36] rib did you notice the body part was a
[1:58:42] byproduct read the next
[1:58:44] phrase but not the
[1:58:50] spirit boy that's power
[1:58:53] powerful you know brother gley was
[1:58:55] preaching last night and he was
[1:58:58] contrasting the things that he had heard
[1:59:01] all of his life around the
[1:59:04] message and what he now knew to be the
[1:59:08] truth and he took an example of a
[1:59:11] quotation that's always used to
[1:59:15] discourage someone from speaking in
[1:59:17] tongues where it is referred to several
[1:59:20] times as sound in like uh
[1:59:24] peas dry Peas on a cide or peas being
[1:59:29] dropped on a cide ratatatat
[1:59:34] Ratatat brother gy said I heard all my
[1:59:36] life that used to keep that gift down
[1:59:40] and then I decided to research that and
[1:59:42] I looked up every time he made that
[1:59:44] statement and every time he made that
[1:59:47] statement it was
[1:59:49] connected to something like a hypocrite
[1:59:54] somebody lying cheating and stealing but
[1:59:58] speaking in tongues and he said I said
[2:00:01] well I'm not
[2:00:03] that then he goes to the next one uh uh
[2:00:06] you know talking about someone running
[2:00:07] around with somebody else's wife and
[2:00:09] still talking in dun and he
[2:00:13] said but I'm not
[2:00:16] that and he goes all through the quotes
[2:00:18] that have been used in his life to keep
[2:00:21] that
[2:00:22] down and discovers that none of them
[2:00:25] were talking about True
[2:00:28] Believers and none of them were talking
[2:00:30] about a true
[2:00:32] experience so what has happened is we've
[2:00:34] taken some quotations and they have been
[2:00:37] used as
[2:00:40] scarecrows to keep people in a false
[2:00:43] identity and we don't identify with
[2:00:46] hypocrite and we don't identify with
[2:00:49] lying stealing and cheating and still
[2:00:52] talking in
[2:00:53] tongues we identify with a genuine
[2:00:56] baptism of the Holy
[2:00:58] Ghost Hallelujah and that Holy Ghost
[2:01:02] that Holy Ghost at some time or
[2:01:07] another will
[2:01:09] testify by by taking the tongue and
[2:01:13] using it as a
[2:01:16] testimony he heard the statement made
[2:01:19] you you should hear it he heard the
[2:01:21] statement made if your if you've never
[2:01:23] heard your pastor speaking in tongues he
[2:01:25] it's probably because he doesn't have
[2:01:27] the Holy
[2:01:28] Ghost and that Disturbed his
[2:01:32] spirit because it seems he he realized
[2:01:34] he' never hurt his
[2:01:36] dad and and he knew his dad he knew the
[2:01:40] life of his dad and he knew his dad had
[2:01:42] the Holy Ghost he comes home from that
[2:01:45] camp and he gets down beside the bed and
[2:01:47] he starts praying one night and he said
[2:01:49] his dad rarely ever did this but his dad
[2:01:51] slipped in knelt down beside him put his
[2:01:54] arm around him and begin to pray for him
[2:01:57] and the next thing you know the Holy
[2:01:59] Ghost began to pray through his dad and
[2:02:01] brother gy said the question was settled
[2:02:04] that
[2:02:05] night it was there he was there and this
[2:02:08] was an
[2:02:09] opportunity to testify so that that
[2:02:13] question could be answered come on let's
[2:02:16] not take something like woman is a
[2:02:18] byproduct and a and make her lesser
[2:02:21] spirit
[2:02:23] spiritually because the Bible teaches us
[2:02:26] spiritually there is neither male nor
[2:02:29] female with God spiritually but this
[2:02:32] flesh is different how many of you know
[2:02:35] it's different and God's particular
[2:02:37] about it and he wants you to dress it up
[2:02:41] differently he wants you to go out of
[2:02:44] here with a distinction in your
[2:02:47] life and to show the world around you
[2:02:50] that you belong to him
[2:02:52] and even your clothes and hair and every
[2:02:54] part of who you are testifying he goes
[2:02:57] on to say and I got to hurry the body
[2:03:00] part of the woman was a byproduct after
[2:03:01] the creation had been finished God took
[2:03:04] from the side of Adam a rib and made a
[2:03:06] woman let's go on but not the spirit the
[2:03:10] spirit was part of Adam remember where
[2:03:12] he got it it was God's original life for
[2:03:15] he was both man and woman spiritually
[2:03:18] speaking both masculine and feminis he
[2:03:22] goes on now don't you see the great
[2:03:25] picture we in flesh are different we're
[2:03:28] like a byproduct a created being by holy
[2:03:32] wedlock but in
[2:03:34] spirit this is Messiah Ed this is
[2:03:38] Messiah this is those who have been
[2:03:40] anointed by the anointing of the Messiah
[2:03:43] but in spirit we are Sons and
[2:03:47] [Music]
[2:03:49] Daughters the Bible clearly says we're
[2:03:53] Sons not some other
[2:03:56] Spirit
[2:03:58] hello but the spirit
[2:04:03] of the Living
[2:04:06] God let's go on we are in his likeness
[2:04:10] in his unity in the perfect image of the
[2:04:12] Living God because we become Sons and
[2:04:14] Daughters not
[2:04:16] separated but the Same Spirit the same
[2:04:19] God the same person Joy in wedlock to
[2:04:23] the Eternal why do you keep beating this
[2:04:27] horse it is in Hope an
[2:04:30] anticipation that tomorrow morning when
[2:04:33] you wake
[2:04:34] up and realize that it's a
[2:04:41] Monday and everything you had
[2:04:45] today is is draining from you and you
[2:04:49] got to go face the world face the job
[2:04:53] face the pressure face the bills it's my
[2:04:57] hope that eventually you'll wake up on a
[2:05:00] Monday morning and you won't yield to
[2:05:02] the flesh or to the emotions of the soul
[2:05:06] but you'll yield to the spirit the part
[2:05:08] of who you are that's just like him and
[2:05:11] you'll raise up out of that bed and say
[2:05:13] there's nothing that's going to happen
[2:05:15] to me today that I'll not be able to get
[2:05:19] to the other side of it because Gra is
[2:05:22] he that is living in
[2:05:26] me than anything I will face
[2:05:30] today I am an
[2:05:33] offspring of almighty God same person
[2:05:38] same God see how God planned it that we
[2:05:40] should be not different but him not a
[2:05:43] different but him not some other being
[2:05:45] of some other tribe but a real say that
[2:05:49] word real Union and offspring of the
[2:05:53] almighty done by a holy union now the
[2:05:56] body comes from mother and father but
[2:05:58] the spirit comes from God God separating
[2:06:01] himself as Adam was
[2:06:04] separated on the day of Pentecost we
[2:06:07] find the Holy Spirit the pillar of fire
[2:06:10] separating
[2:06:12] itself no longer in one man the Lord
[2:06:14] Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah but
[2:06:18] separating himself and now falling on a
[2:06:21] 12 who were fire torches who took the
[2:06:25] fire out and it began to spread God look
[2:06:30] God putting hisself
[2:06:33] together he couldn't put himself
[2:06:35] together in one man
[2:06:37] anymore that's why it disturbs me that
[2:06:40] this message has become such a Onan
[2:06:45] message it disturbs me that so many of
[2:06:48] my brethren have let it all be hung on
[2:06:52] one
[2:06:53] man when our Bible tells us that that he
[2:06:59] was one
[2:07:00] son Jesus coming to Perfection so that
[2:07:04] many
[2:07:05] seed so that many sons could follow
[2:07:11] him Jesus didn't think it was robbery to
[2:07:15] be equal with God because he knew he was
[2:07:19] God
[2:07:23] you may understand at some point it's
[2:07:25] not
[2:07:26] blasphemy for you to understand that
[2:07:29] there's a part of you that is Corporate
[2:07:33] Messiah living in the
[2:07:36] Earth for a purpose for a
[2:07:40] reason and our fellowship together will
[2:07:44] feed a part of who we are we've got to
[2:07:47] make sure that we are not neglecting the
[2:07:49] spirit part of Who We Are to only feed
[2:07:53] flesh and
[2:07:55] soul that Spirit man will wither I want
[2:07:58] you to know I'm going to say this again
[2:08:00] you will not be able to overcome in this
[2:08:03] hour with two sermons a
[2:08:08] week well why don't we have church three
[2:08:11] four five nights because it it doesn't
[2:08:13] become my responsibility to spoon feed
[2:08:16] you all week
[2:08:18] long it becomes your responsib ability
[2:08:22] to
[2:08:23] eat nobody has to tell you to eat
[2:08:27] breakfast your stomach starts calling
[2:08:30] out that Spirit man ought to be calling
[2:08:33] out in you and if it's not it's because
[2:08:38] the flesh is being pampered and the soul
[2:08:41] is being
[2:08:45] fluffed
[2:08:48] ego ego is robbing
[2:08:51] many people of their spiritual
[2:08:55] growth they're protecting an
[2:08:58] ego whoa wait just a moment wait who
[2:09:02] don't don't don't amen Amen
[2:09:05] brother tell the
[2:09:08] truth because we can't waste time
[2:09:15] now we're protecting ego
[2:09:19] reputation I got to be the
[2:09:23] best got to have the best got to be the
[2:09:27] most that's
[2:09:29] ego it's
[2:09:32] ambition you get that Spirit man fed on
[2:09:36] this word and saturated in the presence
[2:09:40] of the Divine glory of God that Divine
[2:09:43] and manifested presence of God and
[2:09:45] you'll start leading those other parts
[2:09:47] of who you are your your your
[2:09:49] regenerated Spirit the breath of God in
[2:09:51] you will start leading those that
[2:09:55] mind it'll start directing your thoughts

[2:10:17] and see how honest you'll
[2:10:18] be has there been any time

[2:10:54] Church you you can't cast emotions
[2:10:58] out you can't cast somebody's soul out
[2:11:01] of them but what you can do is let those
[2:11:04] emotions be
[2:11:09] corraled and brought into
[2:11:12] captivity to the revealed word that says
[2:11:16] you are not to live your life as a wreck
[2:11:23] come on I've been
[2:11:26] there I'm an
[2:11:28] expert I know what anxiety is I know the
[2:11:33] physical effects it will have on your
[2:11:35] body I know it can you can have a
[2:11:38] burnout and and it lasts all day
[2:11:42] long and if you love it and nurse it

[2:11:49] day or you can get out of your
[2:11:53] head get into the
[2:11:56] word and end

[2:12:32] choice you choose whether you you you
[2:12:35] whine and and you cry oh it's not
[2:12:40] fair the reality is it may not be
[2:12:45] fair let me use this as an example this
[2:12:49] could help you
[2:12:51] let me see what time oh I have
[2:12:55] time sister
[2:12:57] Ruth took 50 young people from Calvary
[2:13:02] Pentecostal Church in in uh in Richmond
[2:13:07] Virginia to Jerusalem in
[2:13:11] 1973 to pray over the
[2:13:16] city there were others who joined them
[2:13:19] later from the na nations of the
[2:13:22] world and there are so many things about
[2:13:28] the Middle
[2:13:30] East that conexs
[2:13:36] you
[2:13:38] driving is one of them and yet I would
[2:13:41] rather drive there than
[2:13:44] here because there if you don't take it
[2:13:50] you'll never get
[2:13:52] it so if you get behind the wheel
[2:13:56] timid you'll get run
[2:13:59] over they'll just flatten
[2:14:01] you you know here you know how people do
[2:14:04] at crosswalks here wait till you get
[2:14:07] right up in your
[2:14:12] car and you know what they're saying
[2:14:15] pedestrians have the rideway pedestrians
[2:14:16] have the rideway pedestrians have the
[2:14:18] rideway you'll go to Walmart
[2:14:25] yeah I don't know if the Sanctified go
[2:14:28] to Walmart or
[2:14:30] not but you'll go to
[2:14:32] Walmart and they'll P they'll walk right
[2:14:35] out they'll walk right out they'll run
[2:14:37] see you coming and run till they get
[2:14:39] there and
[2:14:42] then you try that in
[2:14:45] Jerusalem and you'll be a greasy spot on
[2:14:47] the road they will run you over they
[2:14:50] don't know pedestrians have the right
[2:14:52] away I don't care if you've got a
[2:14:54] crosswalk I don't care if the lights
[2:14:56] flashing green I don't care if
[2:14:58] somebody's told you to go you better
[2:15:00] make sure nothing's
[2:15:04] coming or you'll get run over let me
[2:15:07] tell you something else about Jerusalem
[2:15:09] it doesn't have to be posted for it to
[2:15:12] be an illegal place to park most all
[2:15:15] amazing places to park are
[2:15:18] illegal and here if you you don't have a
[2:15:21] sign posted you assume you can park
[2:15:24] there and you've got an argument when
[2:15:26] you go to court not
[2:15:27] there they don't have to tell you by a
[2:15:31] sign no parking you find you a nice
[2:15:35] juicy place to park and you park there
[2:15:37] when you come back you're very likely to
[2:15:40] have a parking ticket I'd like to see
[2:15:43] you go down to the municipality and
[2:15:45] argue
[2:15:46] that they will look at you like you've
[2:15:49] got three heads they will even tell you
[2:15:52] do you know how expensive it is to
[2:15:54] defend this nation pay your parking
[2:15:59] fee so you just start reaching in so
[2:16:02] that is something to complain about cues
[2:16:07] lines this is the Middle East
[2:16:10] honey both Jew and Arab this is the
[2:16:14] Middle East they don't always know what
[2:16:16] lines are about
[2:16:24] you better not even turn around if you
[2:16:26] turn around to look behind you somebody
[2:16:27] will Dart in front of
[2:16:30] you they'll think and you say wait a
[2:16:33] minute and they'll say I thought you
[2:16:35] were getting out of line well I didn't
[2:16:36] move my feet I just moved my
[2:16:39] head come on I'm just giving you an
[2:16:43] example sometimes it rains red mud
[2:16:46] there the hene blows in and the air is
[2:16:49] filled with red dirt off the desert and
[2:16:52] it rains and and and as I told you on my
[2:16:55] way to the mayor's reception in a crisp
[2:16:58] white shirt I meet the mayor of
[2:17:01] Jerusalem shake his hand and apologize
[2:17:03] to him for my muddy white shirt now
[2:17:07] covered in red spots and he says that's
[2:17:10] Holy
[2:17:11] Dirt you're in
[2:17:13] Jerusalem better to be dirty in
[2:17:16] Jerusalem than be somewhere else in the
[2:17:17] world
[2:17:22] sister Ruth found out that young people
[2:17:24] have a tendency to complain about
[2:17:29] everything and so she found out that in
[2:17:32] the course of a day they spent a lot of
[2:17:34] time complaining to one another about
[2:17:38] Jerusalem no lines bad traffic no
[2:17:46] Whoppers and it Disturbed her and one
[2:17:49] day the Lord began to talk talked to
[2:17:51] them in a prayer
[2:17:52] meeting and he began to tell them if
[2:17:55] you're here on assignment don't speak
[2:17:59] anything but good about the
[2:18:06] land he also told them when you're on
[2:18:09] assignment in Jerusalem I'll take care
[2:18:11] of things at
[2:18:13] home don't let your mind be
[2:18:16] distracted by what's happening at home I
[2:18:19] if you're here at my uh request I will
[2:18:23] take care of things at home powerful
[2:18:26] he's done it for
[2:18:28] me it was just powerful and so she began
[2:18:32] to have the young people practice saying
[2:18:35] only good
[2:18:36] things about
[2:18:39] Jerusalem and do you know what that does
[2:18:41] it puts your faith in a different place
[2:18:44] it causes your emotions to calm down
[2:18:47] when someone cuts you off in traffic and
[2:18:49] you're about to uh
[2:18:54] you
[2:18:55] remember bless the land Bless the people
[2:19:00] speak good over this assignment hello

[2:22:10] taking
[2:22:12] Authority when you start setting things
[2:22:14] in order in your own life is everybody
[2:22:17] with me on the day of Pentecost we find
[2:22:19] the Holy Spirit the Pillar of Fire
[2:22:21] separating himself setting upon each
[2:22:23] member of that church God putting
[2:22:25] himself together then that group of
[2:22:27] people together what does it
[2:22:29] do it brings back the unified body of
[2:22:34] the Lord Jesus coming together
[2:22:39] oh that's who I
[2:22:42] am that's who you
[2:22:46] are the unified body of the Lord Jesus
[2:22:50] is coming together isn't that beautiful
[2:22:53] corporate Messiah is
[2:22:58] gathering he's coming back together God
[2:23:02] putting hisself together by drawing
[2:23:05] Those portions of who he is back
[2:23:08] together oh
[2:23:10] my in the message God commissioning
[2:23:13] Moses and when a man becomes Born Again
[2:23:16] of the spirit of God he becomes an
[2:23:19] offspring a Son of God and then he has
[2:23:22] the same type of
[2:23:27] mind that God
[2:23:29] has put you on the mind of Christ we now
[2:23:32] have the Apostle said the mind of
[2:23:36] Christ
[2:23:38] oh when our mind becomes born
[2:23:42] again right we start thinking
[2:23:46] differently when a man becomes born
[2:23:48] again in the spirit of God he becomes an
[2:23:49] offspring or a son of God and then he
[2:23:52] has the same type of mind that God does
[2:23:54] the mind that was in Christ is where now
[2:23:57] where is it
[2:23:58] now in us do you really believe
[2:24:03] that do you think Christ would be so
[2:24:05] easily
[2:24:09] annoyed I'm assuming that's a
[2:24:14] no help
[2:24:17] us and then he has the same type of Mind
[2:24:19] God does the mind that was in Christ is
[2:24:21] in us and we believe for the Unseen for
[2:24:24] the
[2:24:25] miraculous and just anything see then we
[2:24:27] have the Holy Spirit who comes to us and
[2:24:30] speaks to us concerning these things and
[2:24:33] that's the whole purpose of these
[2:24:35] meetings dear Christian friend it's for
[2:24:37] no other purpose before God but that
[2:24:39] your faith in God might be stimulated to
[2:24:42] a place to believe him for the Salvation
[2:24:45] of your soul and for the healing of your
[2:24:48] body somebody say Amen

[2:24:53] 10 John 1:1 he came to his
[2:24:56] own and his own received him not but as
[2:25:01] many come on help me as received him I
[2:25:04] like that to them gave him
[2:25:09] power even to
[2:25:12] them are you one of them if you're one
[2:25:15] of them raise up your hand and say I'm
[2:25:17] one of them I'm one of them this been
[2:25:20] given
[2:25:21] power to become a Son of God even to

[2:25:27] of you believe on his name well have you
[2:25:29] been baptized in it if you hadn't you're
[2:25:30] not believing on it go down to the water
[2:25:34] and take his name wear his name believe
[2:25:37] on his name that word power and he gave
[2:25:41] power is
[2:25:43] exusia it doesn't just mean it's not

[2:26:10] you the example one more
[2:26:12] time it's like Barney
[2:26:16] five brother brandom didn't call him
[2:26:18] Barney five but he talked about out it'd
[2:26:20] be like a little Deputy sir all skinny
[2:26:24] little non-assuming fellow stop out step
[2:26:27] out in front of a a moving vehicle and
[2:26:30] hold up his hand right he said why he
[2:26:33] doesn't have enough power to stop that
[2:26:36] car you see Barney F he can't even get
[2:26:40] to his
[2:26:41] bullet that's how you and I are
[2:26:44] sometime we've so entertained and fed
[2:26:47] ourselves with all the world stuff that
[2:26:50] we know more about the headlines than we
[2:26:52] do the word so we're standing in the
[2:26:54] road and a and and a speeding
[2:26:57] enemy it's about to try to take us out
[2:27:01] and we're fumbling for our
[2:27:04] bullet well it is written well what is
[2:27:09] written you finally find the bullet then
[2:27:11] you can say what's written brother
[2:27:14] brandom said that little old Deputy
[2:27:15] we're going to call him Barney 5 because
[2:27:17] that's who I think of every time I hear
[2:27:18] the sermons
[2:27:20] Barney f is a little old soaking wet
[2:27:23] looking thing who don't even weigh 100
[2:27:24] pounds when he's gets right out of the
[2:27:28] shower and he is not particularly
[2:27:32] pretty and he's kind of a kind of a a a
[2:27:36] fumbling sort of
[2:27:39] personality and he shoots if he does
[2:27:41] shoot it's his own
[2:27:44] shoe and he steps out in front of a
[2:27:47] moving vehicle there's nothing about him
[2:27:49] that would cause anybody who wanted to
[2:27:51] get away You're a bank robber and you
[2:27:54] want to get away you see that funny
[2:27:56] looking little fella standing out there
[2:27:58] with a big nose and big ears and you
[2:28:00] just hope he moves because you're going
[2:28:02] through you're escaping you're getting
[2:28:03] out of there but but
[2:28:06] listen it's not his size it's not his
[2:28:09] power when he flashes that
[2:28:12] badge that's his authority and you
[2:28:15] better not pay any attention to how weak
[2:28:17] he looks or how much you think you you
[2:28:20] can get something over on him you better
[2:28:22] honor that badge because that badge says
[2:28:25] I am authorized he is authorized to stop
[2:28:28] you in your tracks you with me so you
[2:28:32] may not always exercise and and you may
[2:28:34] not always possess the
[2:28:38] power you that only pray on Sundays I
[2:28:41] know you don't have the power to defeat
[2:28:42] the
[2:28:44] enemy I'm sure of that but I'll tell you
[2:28:47] what you do have you've got a
[2:28:49] relationship
[2:28:51] your fellowship may be a little lacking
[2:28:54] but your election is in place so your
[2:28:58] relationship is in place and that gives
[2:29:00] you power to as many as received him
[2:29:02] have you received him how many of you
[2:29:05] received him to as many as have received
[2:29:07] him to them he gave exusia authority
[2:29:12] jurisdiction the ability or strength
[2:29:16] with which one is
[2:29:19] endued I like this the power of
[2:29:23] authority do you believe you have
[2:29:25] authority in Jesus Christ yes do you
[2:29:28] believe that you are coming to a place
[2:29:31] to recognize that your name on the
[2:29:38] check and then the word Sons here is
[2:29:43] techon which is not speaking about a
[2:29:45] fully mature hio
[2:29:48] son it's talking about about a
[2:29:51] child to as many as received him to them
[2:29:55] gave he Authority
[2:29:57] exusia power to be The
[2:30:02] Offspring the toddler the children of
[2:30:08] God Offspring children metaphorically

[2:30:23] he Power Authority to be to become the
[2:30:26] sons of God even to them that believe on
[2:30:29] his name why because God's spirit his
[2:30:33] anointing his life is living inside of
[2:30:36] you can you say Amen believing God
[2:30:39] listen at this one you got to hear this
[2:30:42] you've got to throw aside your
[2:30:45] senses
[2:30:47] wow wow whoever told you that
[2:30:51] listen you've got to throw aside your
[2:30:54] senses and your sensibilities
[2:30:57] too God never give you those senses to
[2:31:00] trust him
[2:31:02] with God give you his Spirit to trust
[2:31:06] him yes your sense is only to contact
[2:31:09] see taste feel smell and hear but to you
[2:31:15] yourself is that spirit that lives in

[2:31:26] regenerated and the old
[2:31:30] man died and the new man born again that
[2:31:35] is a part of God then you become a Son
[2:31:40] of God an offspring of the Creator a
[2:31:45] chip off the old block you could say
[2:31:47] then you can believe what
[2:32:00] the impossible things are you facing
[2:32:03] something right
[2:32:04] now that looks
[2:32:07] impossible if you got a situation in
[2:32:10] your life right now that
[2:32:12] you cannot see the other
[2:32:18] side you see the inside of who you are
[2:32:21] is

[2:32:24] is in
[2:32:27] time we often

[2:32:56] lifespans we see due
[2:33:00] dates but it's due in a few days that's
[2:33:04] time that's in
[2:33:08] time if you look at your
[2:33:11] situation from the dimension of
[2:33:14] time you may feel
[2:33:17] hopeless but if you will allow ow your
[2:33:22] mind to drift
[2:33:24] toward the
[2:33:27] Eternal you will recognize that God can
[2:33:30] move on your behalf so
[2:33:35] quick so
[2:33:38] suddenly you you know how quick a life
[2:33:41] can change one phone call can change
[2:33:45] your life

[2:34:33] could so move for
[2:34:38] you that your life would never be the
[2:34:41] same again it may look
[2:34:43] impossible but because you're an
[2:34:45] offspring of the Creator you can believe
[2:34:47] the impossible things because you are
[2:34:50] made

[2:39:11] clay outwardly extremely
[2:39:15] finite outwardly very natural
[2:39:19] sometimes
[2:39:20] carnal
[2:39:22] outwardly but

[2:39:30] of God you become a supernatural being
[2:39:34] in
[2:39:36] there and that supernatural being
[2:39:40] hungers and thirst for its Heavenly Home
[2:39:43] Yonder that's right

[2:39:51] coming the world is falling
[2:39:56] apart it
[2:39:58] is it
[2:40:04] is but I'm
[2:40:07] assuming that you didn't come here
[2:40:10] today for me to tell you all the ways
[2:40:14] that the world is falling apart because
[2:40:17] you already know them
[2:40:21] you've seen it on the
[2:40:24] fox you've read it on the
[2:40:29] internet I doubt there's anybody in here
[2:40:32] that takes a
[2:40:34] newspaper but if you did you've read it
[2:40:36] in the newspaper the world is falling
[2:40:39] apart she's forgotten God
[2:40:51] our college
[2:40:55] campuses are educating
[2:41:00] fools there's just some things you can't
[2:41:02] teach in a
[2:41:08] lesson they're getting more of their
[2:41:10] opinion from Tick
[2:41:12] Tock than they are their
[2:41:15] professors and unfortunately their
[2:41:17] professors are highly influenced by Tick
[2:41:23] Tock and so you've got somebody that
[2:41:26] that's like a
[2:41:29] shim leading the March last
[2:41:32] week calling for the death of
[2:41:38] Zionist the university expelled
[2:41:46] it but
[2:41:49] one of our
[2:41:51] representatives from the squad was going
[2:41:54] to be speaking on the
[2:41:56] campus Because where there's that kind
[2:41:59] of a controversy she likes to bring her
[2:42:02] ignorance and so they leted him back on
[2:42:05] he's been expelled he's been to stay off
[2:42:07] the property and they let him come back
[2:42:09] and and attend
[2:42:12] her speech and have a photo op with her
[2:42:16] and he becomes even more famous while
[2:42:19] calling for the death of all
[2:42:23] Zionist we're talking about someone who
[2:42:25] can't even Define the
[2:42:28] word in ivy league
[2:42:34] universities I saw where Dartmouth had a
[2:42:36] big
[2:42:39] one even Southern
[2:42:42] universities calling for the death of
[2:42:47] Zionist calling
[2:42:50] Israel an oppressor and guilty of
[2:42:54] genocide while Rockets continue to fly
[2:42:58] every day and while we've been sitting

[2:43:04] barrage of things taking place and the

[2:46:10] creative
[2:46:13] yes but the reality is when we feel
[2:46:18] something
[2:46:19] when we hear something when we think we
[2:46:22] know something about this body we're
[2:46:26] quick to find the
[2:46:29] remedy or a
[2:46:31] pill that I'm not against
[2:46:35] medicine everybody needs a little poison
[2:46:38] to keep them going I
[2:46:43] think I just choose mine as fried
[2:46:45] chicken and not a prescription but
[2:46:47] anyway
[2:46:51] um we we sometimes just accept
[2:46:54] it and never deal with it you don't have
[2:46:58] to do that why don't you work on that
[2:47:01] one oh Lord instead of saying hey I got
[2:47:04] a new pain does anybody have new ones
[2:47:07] still coming

[2:47:42] can't live here the blood of Jesus lives
[2:47:47] here
[2:47:49] come
[2:47:50] on use the authority that God has given
[2:47:53] you as corporate
[2:47:55] Messiah to deal with some of these
[2:47:57] things do it consistently do it daily
[2:48:01] don't do it once a week do it daily and
[2:48:05] see if God won't move on your
[2:48:07] behalf we've been hearing as I said
[2:48:09] earlier I'm done we've been hearing
[2:48:13] testimonies of people overcoming huge
[2:48:17] obstacles
[2:48:19] without a personal
[2:48:23] prophecy without a prayer
[2:48:26] line they just heard the word they
[2:48:29] believed the word and the next thing you
[2:48:32] know they acted on the
[2:48:35] word if you believe it you'll act on it
[2:48:39] right true faith will act on it you hear
[2:48:43] that line in Kate's song this
[2:48:46] morning you've got the faith you act on
[2:48:49] that faith and see what God will do it's
[2:48:53] not about feeling like it it's about
[2:48:56] exercising who you are let's
[2:48:59] stand there's so much Authority in this
[2:49:03] room blows my mind that the enemy would
[2:49:07] even try to show up
