that the Lord is strengthening them and helping them we miss them very much but we're glad that they could have this time away and we are pressing in to keep the home fires burning to continue to press into this Supernatural year that the Lord has given to us he is Supernatural God and we are grateful that he is doing Supernatural things we don't always recognize it but he is he's doing things that are above and beyond the natural realm and we are so very thankful for that to all of you that are watching this service by way of live stream we notice Norway and Trinidad and the UK and all over the United States we welcome you to this service and trust that the Lord will bless you in whatever way that you need his Blessing you know I'm I'm beginning to realize that the biggest blessing that some people could get from the Lord is a spanking to get them back in line not because I want them hurt but because they need to get back in line and and and it may not feel like a blessing at the time but really if they get back in alignment with God and they look back on it they realize that that spanking was a blessing so I say may God bless you in whatever way you need to be blessed if it's a good blessing if it's a spanking blessing he knows how to do it and I don't have to tell him how don't have to tell him what I can just say God you bless the people the way they need to be blessed as we sit under the hearing of the word he can bless us and move us shift us help us to get in alignment I'd like to go back to Malachi chapter 3 where we were last Sunday we were blessed to have brother Shelley here on Tuesday night uh not real nice circumstances but God knows what he's doing and we're continuing to pray for the Shelley family that God will grant them strength and comfort at the loss of more Shelley and we continue to press on believing that we will have a glad reunion day amen and originally it was announced that brother Shelley would be preaching today but he was here on Tuesday night and I just really want the Lord to do everything for him that the Lord wants to do and I want to stand at my post of Duty with gladness to speak to you and give you the word of the Lord so last Sunday we were in Malachi chapter 3 and we got through the first five verses of the chapter and uh so let us just pick up in verse 6. Malachi 3 and we'll start in verse six for I am the Lord I change not therefore you sons of Jacob are not consumed from the days of your fathers you're gone away from mine ordinances and have not kept them return unto me and I will return unto you saith the Lord of hosts but you have said wherein shall we return will a man rob God yet you have robbed me but you say wherein have we robbed thee in tithe and offerings you're cursed with a curse for you have robbed me even this whole nation bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in my house and prove me now here with saith the Lord of hosts if I will not open to you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it and I will rebuke the Devourer for your sakes and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground neither shall your Vine cast her fruit before the time in the field saith the Lord of hosts and All Nations shall call you blessed for you shall be a delightsome land saith the Lord of hosts your words have been Stout against me saith the Lord yet you say what have we spoken so much against thee you have said it is vain to serve God and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts and now we call the proud happy yea they that work wickedness are set up yea they that tempt God or even delivered and they that feared the Lord spake often one to another and the Lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord and that thought upon his name let's get the last two verses in and they shall be mine saith the Lord of hosts in that day when I shall make up my jewels and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him then shall you return and discern between the righteous and the wicked between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word and you can have your seats today last week we were looking at this same chapter and taking it verse by verse this is a what we called an ongoing prophecy a prophecy that continues to be updated uh it has had a prophetic value it has had a prophetic significance in years past it is currently being uh carried out we are seeing things in this chapter that are currently coming to pass they're currently unfolding before us and then we know that is if if as time tarries should that be God's plan that we're going to see this happen happen over again it's just the way God works when he uh he gave us scripture for that purpose scripture doesn't come to us to go away he takes a passage of scripture and allows us to get new understanding new meaning new benefit as the years go by something can be in a place where that we don't Focus too much on it and then all of the sudden God highlights it and he brings it back to our remembrance and he uses the word to speak to us all over again in an updated manner God lifts himself out of the pages of history for us to benefit from and we can be benefited by the word of God if we allow him to be a present tense God rather than an I was God he is I am not I was or even I will be although we know he will be and we know he was but he is currently present tense I am carrying out his word to us so that we can better align ourselves with him with his word and he's talking to us if we'll listen and so uh one of the things that we like carried on last week was the refiners fire and the uh Fuller soap the refiners fire being a very hot fire that would melt metal down uh not a pleasant thought to be someone who is in The Melting Pot in the fire to where that we're being melted down but God does this so that we will allow all of the dross all of the impurities to rise to the top so that he can skim them off and as we have already said there are there are times that God allows these processes to repeat because when this happens he gives us the opportunity to repent for the sin that we can see I can't see all of them but I repent for the sin the unbelief that I see at this current moment and then we go on a little way and God allows us to some of those things that uh maybe we we were hurt and and it caused us to to have anxiety to think about these things that we'd hurt God With God lets us go on a little while and then we have to go in the Melting Pot again and and he he lets that dross come to the top again and we have to repent for the sin that we see and he repeats this process over and over again and then the Fuller soap that whitening soap of the Fuller we told you that the Fuller was one who beat and pounded and stomped to get the clothes clean and he used a special soap the whitening soap and that's what the blood of Jesus does for us and we a lot of times feel like we're being pounded we feel like we're being stomped on we feel like that we're getting a real beating but all of this is for the purposes of God to unfold in our life it doesn't feel good no chastening feels good at the moment but we know that it is working a beautiful art piece of God every piece of art that goes into the Hall of Fame first has to go through the Hall of critics [Music] every believer that's going to ever make it in a Rapture is going to have to go through the refiners fire and the Fuller soap and the beating and the pounding and the chastening it's just part of this walk with the Lord we can either become bitter angry Disturbed run away or we can come up close to the Lord and let him apply the sav of his Sweet Holy Spirit to us and let all of those things that we have felt like that we have been so hurt by he can rub save in them and we can allow that chastening of the Lord to bring us right in line with him so then we tell we we concluded last Sunday service with uh verse 5 after we talked about the peace of God settling down over us and and letting him bring our praise back and we talked about these seven things in verse 5 that he was going to be a swift witness against so we pick up today in verse 6. for I am the Lord I change not therefore you sons of Jacob are not consumed if God consumed everybody that ever trespassed him there'd be a whole bunch of grease on the pavement and anybody who was left would slip and fall on our Grease but he is the Lord and it is not sure from Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 8 that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever he does not change when Abraham was walking with the Lord and God called him out of his uh his land of nativity where he grew up and he there were Idols all around him his name was Abram and God called Abram out and he said come out from the land of your fathers and walk with me and I will take you into a land that is Flowing with milk and honey a land that you don't know anything about I'm going to give it to you if you're willing to come with me and I'm gonna give you seed and uh the this your seed are going to be like the stars in the sky going to be like the sand of the seashore and God gives him all of this word just like he's given you this God gave Abraham all of this word and told him right now you are childless right now you're Barren right now you are in the midst of idolaters but you come out from among them and you walk with me and let me show you what I can do on your behalf I'm going to give you a son and so Abraham walks with him and the Bible in the New Testament says that Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith this gives me hope gives me a glorious hope because God gave us a back story about Abraham and my natural eyes see that Abraham staggered some my natural eyes see that Abraham made mistakes my natural eyes see and read that Abraham lied to rulers to Kings somebody that could have took his head off but because that the promise of God was upon Abraham's life his life could not be taken before its time because there was a promise that had to be fulfilled in Abraham's life and even though my natural mind my reading and and comprehension of the back story it looks like that Abraham made all kinds of mistakes it looks like that he did not trust the promise of God it looks like he went astray it looks like that he lied and he told all kinds of stories about Sarah being his sister and this kind of thing to to cause people to be deceived or to be led astray yet God comes over in the New Testament and says Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief you have this same finished story I have this same finished story because as was preached here by our pastor on Tuesday night by a prefix Destiny by God's foreknowledge he Those whom he foreknew he could predestinate or give a prefix Destiny he already knew by his foreknowledge he knew your choice he knew the choices that you would make the good ones and the dumbleness the lovely ones and the ugly ones he knew all of those decisions but he knew that the ultimate decision that you would make would be to follow him and because of that ultimate decision of you saying yes Lord he could give you a prefix destiny and he could line out a path for you that would intertwine with all of these people sitting here and he could at the end of your story say as he did Abraham he staggered not at the promise do I fail yes do you fail yes do you make mistakes yes but the key is you keep coming back as Abraham did to El Shaddai you keep coming back to that one that can pour pour strength into you and cause you now God understood all of these things about Abraham Abram and then Abraham and when Abraham after his name had been changed he had this promised son Isaac and God told Abraham take him up to Mount Moriah and there offer him so Abraham obedient has already settled the issue before he ever climbs the mountain and lays him upon the altar and he lifts the knife take his life to take Isaac's life and the angel of the Lord stopped his hand and we pick up in Genesis chapter 22 verse 15. the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham Out of Heaven the second time and he said by myself have I sworn saith the Lord be before because thou has done this thing and has not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the Heaven and the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemy and in thy seed Christ shall all of the nations of the earth be blessed because thou Hast obeyed my voice now because of the because of The Obedience of Abraham This Promise came to him though he faltered along the way according to natural looking at things yet God saw the end of his story that he would in the end settle the whole matter and he would be willing to offer Isaac his son and God knew that there was something in Abraham already moving that Abraham was going to be at the end Abraham was going to be completely obedient forget all of the rest of the stuff all of the rest of the stuff in the end Abraham was going to be obedient God knew it and therefore God could give him a prefix Destiny and he could come and he could bless Abraham in such a way and he said by myself I have sworn there was no one Higher Hebrews chapter 6 verse 13 says for when God made a promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise for men verily swear by the greater and an oath for Comfort May for confirmation is to them an end of all strife wherein God willing more abundantly to show unto The Heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel now you can take the opportunity to put yourself right in that verse because we are Heirs of the promise God willing more abundantly to show unto The Heirs of Promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for Refuge to lay hold upon the Hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the Veil wither the Forerunner is for us entered even Jesus made an high priest Forever After the order of Melchizedek now God made a promise to Abraham and he is the god who does not change and by two immutable things his promise and his oath his word and his Oath by two immutable things he has given this promise to Abraham but he also makes this promise transferable to those who are in Christ and so he has given us his word his promise now we happen to be in the same position as Abraham we are human beings and there are things that we have been told we have been prophesied to we have seen in the word and again there are these ongoing prophecies prophecies that we're looking to unfold before us and we get impatient with God but yet God doesn't change he is still God he gave his promise and because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself he gave us an oath of promise that he was going to perform his word now Abraham never saw the Fulfillment the complete fulfillment of what he was really looking for Abraham was in the older Covenant he obeyed god with everything that he was supposed to obey God with he finally had that promised son Isaac through Sarah not the Bond woman Hagar with Ishmael the wild seed no he had the son of promise but the son of Promise was really Christ Jesus the Lord and Abraham saw Isaac but he didn't really see the Fulfillment of the promise seed Christ he was already passed from the Earth God in all of his infinite wisdom let years Roll by let years Roll by let years Roll by until that the appointed time for Christ to come into the Earth Yeshua Jesus to come into the Earth God condescended into flesh human flesh walk the face of the Earth he had to come in the form of a man he came in a human body and he walked as we have been hearing 100 percent God 100 percent man walking on the face of the Earth and then he walked up to that final place on his Earthly Journey Calvary because for us Abraham never got to see it he didn't even have the blessing of looking back in history to see that God came down in human flesh and walked on Earth and gave himself a ransom but we as uh Believers in 2023 we have the blessing to know that God has given a promise and he kept that promise and he came down to earth and he gave his life for a ransom he just didn't swear something out of his mouth but he delivered by giving his very life on Calvary he made a promise to you made a promise to Abraham when he made this promise he delivered on it by coming in human flesh but he gave away for a Believer so that this could remain God that does not change he made a way for believers to get back to him he told us in Romans chapter 10 but what saith it the word is neither even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and Shall Believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved this is God's promise to you for salvation and he didn't just give you a written promise and hope for the best but he swear by himself he did not send someone else to the cross hoping for the best in the beginning was the word and the word was with God the Word was God and the word became flesh and dwelled Among Us the word became flesh it was no longer just the low gosp but now it's a human form it is God In the Flesh dwelling Among Us coming down into this level so that he could demonstrate to us there was nobody greater than myself to swear by so I came myself and then he gave his life so that we could have salvation and not only salvation but that we could have sanctification first John 1 7-9 but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves then the truth is not in US if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness anything in me in you that is not right unright not right all of it he is willing to cleanse us from it but if we have a part in this equation if we confess our sins he is faithful to forgive us our sins once again smoking is not a sin drinking not a sin doing drugs not a sin running with women not a sin these are all attributes of unbelief unbelief because we don't really believe the word of God that our Temple our body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost and we want to protect it at all costs and so we want to stay within the confines of the word of God so that we know that he's going to let his Blessing rest upon us according to his good pleasure so if we confess our sins he is faithful he is faithful he is faithful he is the same yesterday and today and forever all of those that are in the past the sins of the past what I see today what I may encounter tomorrow all of my unbelief let's just make sure we keep that word in there unbelief because we find ourselves where our mind likes to trick us that we are doing everything right we're doing everything right but yet we're disbelieving some promise that God has given to us and when we find ourselves in a place of unbelief we will generally find ourselves going down a wrong path it's just like a leadership uh an exit ramp to uh to a wrong path but if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness he gives us further instruction if you repent you're baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost Acts 2 38. how we know that Matthew 28 19 says be baptized in the name Acts 2 reveals the name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow every tongue should confess in the name repent and be baptized in the name Lord Jesus Christ he revealed his name it no longer has to be titles he revealed his name and when he gave his name he gave his name so powerfully that at that name every knee has to bow every tongue has to comp confess that he is Lord that name there's no name higher than that name all the family in heaven an earth named after that name now he also gave us in that in his promise to us in his oath to us part of that um the give a gift that he gave when he went to the Cross was salvation sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost but he also gave the healing of our bodies yes it was part of the atonement when he gave himself at Calvary part of that atonement was for the healing of our bodies for even here unto were ye called because Christ also suffered for us this is First Peter chapter 2 verse 21. he suffered for us leaving us an example that we should follow his steps who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth who when he was reviled he reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but he committed himself to him that judges righteously who his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose stripes you were healed healing was not just yesterday healing is today healing is tomorrow it is part of the atonement that was given to us he also told us in John 14 let not your heart believe it be troubled you believe in God believes also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am you may be also we have for many years had this Earthly concept of a mansion streets of gold these Mansions we're going to have all of these rooms and we talk about this mansion that we can conjure up in our mind with an Earthly mentality and every one of us talk about this mansion that we're going to go live in with all these rooms and all these gold fixtures and uh you're going to live there by yourself you got all these rooms what are you gonna do with them but I've got a mansion that's waiting for me this Shack that I live in I'm Gonna Leave it behind and I've Got a Mansion one that's beyond all of my imagination that is waiting for me when I step into that new body I'm not going to care about what I can think about down here what people call mansion that they're trying to sell and they can't get their value out of because it's got too many rooms for two people they want rid of it because it's too much too much upkeep but I've got a new body waiting for me over there and I'm not going to care about all of the mansions that are down here the the the idea of the Mansion down here with all of its upkeep I'm going to have a new body I'm going to have a mansion that's not going to need upkeep like these Mansions down here not going to have a body that has a bunch of upkeep like a half right here I'm gonna have a new body all of these promises were given to us through the gift of the word of God and He swore it by himself he went to Calvary himself he didn't send somebody else he did it himself because he wanted to make sure the promise was delivered don't ever let yourself have the mindset of the world God doesn't keep his promises 20 years have gone by and he didn't accomplish what he said he was going to accomplish I often wonder about the people through the scripture because the the Bible teaches us that if a prophet prophesies and it doesn't come to pass he should be stoned but I have often wondered how many people wanted to Stone Isaiah because Isaiah was dead and gone off the scene many many years before his prophecy was fulfilled some of these other prophecies that we see in the scripture and their ongoing prophecy there they they were fulfilled once upon a time but there's there's a repeat of them but wonder what people thought with some of these men and wonder if they really wanted to Stone I wonder if some of them didn't go to the high priest and say this man prophesied and it ain't come to pass it's been 10 years and it hasn't come to pass I think we ought to take him out and stone him we also have to remember that a prophet is a human being and that he is prophesying with what he has knowledge of at the moment perhaps Jeremiah did not see modern day automobiles in his vision they talked about carriages jostling in the streets do you think he saw a 2023 Mercedes-Benz going down the road and crashing into a 2009 Ford Escape probably not because he was prophesying with what he knew and as things change over the years then we start saying oh that was false prophecy no it was prophesying according to what he knew at the time with the with the I I mean a man has got a got a he only has a limited understanding and he's trying to reach in from one realm and bring it into the Earthly realm and speak it I'm not trying to I'm not trying to say that there aren't false prophets I think there's a whole lot of people that prophesy that prophesy out of their soul I think there are a lot of people who watch too much television spend too many hours watching news cycles and then prophesy out of what you know it's there's a mixture and so then that mixture gets into the church system and people are you know and it's constant it's constant off of that and on to other things the promise of the word of God has been given to us God came down himself and he took on him the form of sinful flesh died at Calvary and delivered it to us and it is an ongoing prophecy to us that we can have salvation we can have the promise of the Holy Ghost in our lives today it wasn't just for those in the old in in on the day of Pentecost it was for us today it belongs to us because we are Heirs of the promise God saw by that prefix destiny that we would desire this promise and that we would fight for it as Abraham did and so he could give us the the the gift of that promise and know that he had sealed it with his own blood at Calvary that he delivered it to us and that it was good enough to last all of these years up to current Day Jesus Christ himself being the same yesterday and today and forever well we've due out a whole long time on one verse even from the days of your fathers you're gone away from mine ordinances and have not kept them we're in verse 7 now of Malachi chapter 3. return unto me and I will return unto you saith the Lord of hosts but you have said wherein shall re we return now when we read verse 7 he is speaking to a generation but he is saying even from the days of your fathers you are gone away from mine ordinances now this appears to be a multi-generational falling away or a multi-generational disregard for the word of God and somewhere there was a first generation [Music] who said I don't have to do this and so most probably that first generation who said all those rules and regulation that Moses gave to us it's a bunch of nonsense I'm going to live my life the way I want to and so out of a out of a heart of rebellion that first generation decided that they were going to wander away that may not have been their thought process I'm just going to step away from all of this teaching there was a mind process that calls them to say all of that stringent process that Moses told us we had to be a part of I just don't see that it's necessary anymore we live in a modern age why do we have to do it and so that generation out of rebellion walked away from the Covenant of the Lord then there as the Next Generation came their children then they decided either not to tell their children about all of this nonsense that Moses made us do or else they said you know we were once a part of that church over there and that church over there they had such strict rules they had so many things that we just couldn't keep up with all them the priests were all the time down our throat because we weren't doing this right and we weren't doing that right and we just got tired of the priest being down our neck all the time telling us how wrong we were in the way we were doing them and we just got tired of hearing it so we just decided we weren't going to do it no more generational we as parents can either teach our children the truths of the word of God and stand by them or by our words and actions we can take them down a wrong path Deuteronomy chapter 6 verse 6 through 15. and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently to thy children and shall talk of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way and when you lie down and when you rise up and you shall bind them for a sign upon thine hand and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes and thou shall write them upon the posts of thine house on thy Gates and it shall be when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he swear to the fathers to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob to give the great and goodly cities which thou build us not and houses full of all good things which thou fillest not and Wells digged which you didn't dig Vineyards and olive trees which you didn't plant when you shall have eaten and be full then beware lest I'll forget the Lord which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage Thou shalt fear the lord thy God and serve him and shall swear by his name you shall not go after other gods of the Gods of the people which are around about you for the Lord thy God is a jealous God among you lest the anger of the Lord thy God be kindled against thee and Destroy thee from off of the face of the Earth let's bring this up to Modern to today the Lord our God is a jealous God he won't share his glory with another and he is jealous over you he is jealous over you and there have been times in our lives where we we have allowed the circumstances of life to draw us away from the Commandments of the Lord but because he is jealous over you I'm bringing it back to this prefix Destiny because he is jealous over you the way he was jealous over Abraham even though Abraham it looks like made mistakes even though it looks like you make mistakes God is jealous over his promise you are the promise and God is jealous over his promise you are a word sent from God and you will not return unto him void and so he's jealous over the promise and so he's continually yes there are times maybe that it seems like he's got angry but it's only because he's jealous over the promise and he's trying to get you back in the right path so he tells us his parents to teach our children teach them when you're in the house teach them when you're walking down the sidewalk teach them when you're when you're lying down to go to sleep teach them when you rise up teach them it's the responsibility of a parent to teach their children about the good things of the Lord about the the uh all of the promises all of the things in the word of God it's the the part of the parent to teach the children there is no way that two Services a week is all the training that your children need two Services a week is not all the training I need I need to be in training in forward momentum when I'm in the house when I'm going down the sidewalk meditating on the things of God let them be as frontlets between your eyes let the word hide the word in your heart that you may not sin against the Lord God now you may not be able to memorize the whole Bible but you can take a phrase of a promise and you can meditate on it going down the road you can take one scripture and you can meditate on it if you can't remember any Scripture you can go down the road just thanking the Lord because that he has brought you out of Darkness right into the light of the goodness and gospel of the goodness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and as parents we teach it to our children as Grandparents we continue to teach it to our children we want to be Godly Parents we want to be Godly grandparents we want to be Godly great grandparents because we want this to be a multi-generational blessing that follows us through the course of history we want this to go on and on and on that our children and our children's children and their children continue to hold to the promise even though even though it seems like 600 years ago that Isaiah prophesied it I won my children and their children and their children to say the promises of God are still yes and there's still a man do not want my children and my grandchildren my great-grandchildren should I be on this Earth long enough for that I don't want them to ever say grandpa I don't know why you're waiting around for that promise that one's long gone no I want there to be a generational faith a generational Faith a faith that was passed from my father to me from me to my children and now my children to their children this is a faith that is being passed on generation to generation but in this instance God comes to these people and he said from the days of your fathers You're Gone Gone Away from mine ordinances and not kept them and then he offers them something returned to me return unto me and I will return unto you saith the Lord of hosts their answer was a question in what way shall we return in what way shall we return God gives them an answer to their question with a question will a man rob God yet you have robbed me sorry this is just part of the chapter in what way shall we return where have we gone off the track what is it going to take to get us back in line with the promises that have been made to us God says to them return to me and the people responded what do we got to do to return and God says you've robbed me and they said how have we robbed you and God's answer was in tithe tithes and offerings Now by robbing God of tithe and offerings they and we disrupt God's order if you ever look at your tithe or your offering as giving money to a church you are going to end up in a place at some point in your life where you're aggravated with the church or with the leadership and you're going to be angry some way and you're gonna say I'm going to withhold my tithe and withhold my offering don't like the way they're doing that I'm not giving anything but you are disrupting God's order what do I mean with that in the Old Testament s that were in uh they were to keep order in the Tabernacle we remember we go back to the time of Moses and Moses comes down off of the mountain and there's a bunch of Chaos in the camp because Moses had been gone a long time and and then he says who Moses comes into the camp and there's the golden calf he says who is on the Lord's Side there was this group of men that come to him they were the Levites then because originally it was supposed to be the firstborn that were to be uh keepers of the Tabernacle but because of what happened in the camp under the leadership of Aaron God changed it and he said the Levites were to have the oversight of the Tabernacle and then God said they're not to work they are to be keepers of the Tabernacle they're going to watch over all of the aspects of the Tabernacle and they do not get any inheritance their inheritance is in the things of God then God tells the people bring your tithe and your tithe is what is going to support the Levites then you bring your offerings in all of these offerings that you bring the Levites are hands on with them imagine all the blood all of the animals all of the Skins all of the bones all of the meat all of the stink all of the Flies buzzing around because there's so much blood I want you to get a picture of what the priest dealt with they weren't lazy they had a hard hard work that they were to do now just suppose there was about three quarters I'm making it a big number because I want you to really get a picture here about three quarters of the nation of Israel said I don't really like the priests I don't like the way they're doing things don't like Moses don't like Aaron don't like the way that I I really don't want to go to the Tabernacle area because it's smelly it's bloody there's too much noise all of these things are going on and the people decide that they're not going to bring their offerings and they're not going to bring their tithe what was the purpose of the Levites their purpose was to offer the offerings to the Lord a man as an individual was not authorized to do it himself and so the priest was that the priest's plural in the Tabernacle Arena they were the ones that were constantly checking to see if the sacrifice was clean if it was good and bring it in and Slaughter it and and take care of it and offer it to the Lord that was their job so I want you to see these priests as intercessors they were intercessors on behalf of the people so if the people decided I don't want to take my offering I'm not going to give my tithe to support the Levites I really don't want I don't like the way they handle things and so I'm going to withhold my time and if enough of them did then what happens the priests are starving and the priests are not doing the work of the intercessor you're disrupting the plan of God now if we as Believers in 2023 withhold our tithe and our offering because we're mad at the preacher we don't like the way things are done we don't like how money is handled we don't like any of that stuff if we get our mind on money rather than this is an offering to the Lord I am keeping Covenant with the Lord than you or I am disrupting the plan of God by withholding our tithes by withholding our offering we're disrupting the plan of God and we're actually removing the intercession out of our lives God gave the fivefold ministry for the perfecting of the Saints and the fivefold ministry was given so that there could be a form of intercession I know that there are intercessors as as far as lay members but God has a divine order he chose the foolishness of preaching he chose the five-fold ministry that was his choosing and he chose for them to be supported in the same way by tithe and by offering and if we should get it in our mind that this is just money or we don't like the way that this is done or that's done and we withhold it we're removing the intercession uh for our own lives and we don't want to be found doing that we've been taught in this day that tithing should be given where that we get our food and when God begins to pour out his Blessing God is telling these people you have robbed me and because that you have withheld your tithe and you're offering that you are robbing him he gave them the answer in the way that they were robbing him it was a big deal to God he wanted the Levites to be taken care of he wanted them to be in their positions every one of us need to be in our position in Christ if we're not called to preach the gospel we can pray we can sing we can help to bring atmosphere we all have a part to play and the tithe was never ours to start with it was his that's why he said you're robbing me but he didn't just leave it at tithe he said in offerings too we don't always understand uh all of these things yet God has an order that he has put the church in in the in the end time to be able to follow these things because he really wants to pour you out a blessing that you cannot receive one that you don't have the capacity to contain and so when you rob God you're cutting off your own blessing and who wants to cut off their own blessing nobody wants to cut off their own blessing but when they get in a in a state where that they are muddled-minded and they get this idea in their head that I don't like that I don't like that why do we have to do it this way this is the way that the enemy uses he uses it then people say I can't afford to pay tithe brings me back to the story of my own father and somebody asked him how he could afford to pay tithe and he says I can't afford not to there was something in him that he had a revelation that the blessings of God would be cut off if he chose to keep God's part for himself to pay a bill then a few weeks ago we talked about the devil's tithe football tickets baseball tickets eyeliner lipstick fake fingernails hair stylings tattoos jewelry cigarettes alcohol gambling robbery goes down the path you rob God and God pulls the blessing off of you the devil's gonna rob you because he's a thief he comes to steal to kill and to destroy and so if you don't pay your tithe if you don't give your tithe I I I don't like that phraseology because I'm not paying my tithes I'm giving God what belongs to him not really paying anything I'm giving to him what belongs to him and then I'm bringing an offering extra on top of that because that is how the blessing of God comes in our life and if we try to Rob him as they did and God beckoned them back and he told them you're cursed with a curse for you've robbed me even this whole nation has robbed me he told him to bring the tithe into the storehouse so that there would be meat in my house and then he gives an offer to them prove me prove me now herewith saith the Lord prove me examine try to prove prove me if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing and there not be enough room to receive it prove me examine me see if when you keep your part of what I've requested see if I will not pour you out a blessing and there not be room enough to receive it we get these over analytical Minds that say I've been able to receive everything I've ever gotten he has gone so far above and beyond for us when we should have been dead he kept us when we were rebellious he could have done so much to cause us inflicted pain it would have been well within his rights to do it because we were rebellious but yet he brings us back into line he brings us back into line and he allows the blessings of God to come down over us and there have been seasons of our time where that we have received blessing from him that we didn't know what to do with we just didn't know how to respond to the blessing that we were getting we always think Financial and that's not the only way that blessing comes to us he comes with blessing to us even the blessing of him letting us see unbelief in our life to get it out now why is this this is because there's a divine order and there is intercession that is going on on our behalf at all times there's intercession going on till that God is allowing things to happen in our lives to bring the correction in our lives that we need and though it may not feel good at the moment this is a blessing that we really need in our lives because when we really examine our hearts our desire is that we are so right before the Lord perfect in his sight perfect and steadfast and not wavering from any of his promises that's what we really want what are you going to do with a thousand mules thousand camels what are you going to do with a fleet of Cadillacs or Mercedes or BMWs or whatever it is you want what are you going to do with a 10 room mansion in 14 bathrooms in a pool house in a guest house what are you going to do with it when you leave here you can't take it with you there is only one thing that you get to take when you leave here that is your redeemed spirit it's all you're taking with you you have a new body prepared you sure don't want to take this one with you what good is a piece of gold from planet Earth going to do you in a new Heaven and a new Earth what good is a automobile gonna do you if you could take it with you it'd be worthless in Heaven's frequency he's poured out a blessing on us and continues to pour out the blessing on us that we don't have room enough to receive it then he goes on in verse 11 I'm going to wind down here I will rebuke the Devourer for your sakes the Devourer eats devours consumes and wastes I will rebuke the Devourer for your sakes and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground neither shall your Vine cast her fruit before the time in the field saith the Lord of hosts All Nations shall call you blessed for you shall be a delightsome land saith the Lord of hosts now the Devourer is constantly out to destroy always as a roaring lion he comes to Devour the enemy there is this promise that we have in the word that if we will do our part in giving of our tithe and offering if we uh do our part in responding to him till that we're not robbing him he said that he was going to rebuke the Devourer for your sakes and he shall just he shall not destroy the fruits of your grounds now in Exodus chapter 23 verses 23 through 30. for mine angel shall go before thee this is the children of Israel a promise from the Lord for the children of Israel he said for mine Angel shall go before thee and bring thee in unto the amorites and the Hittites and the parasites the Canaanites the hivites and the jebusites and I will cut them off thou shall not bow down to their gods nor serve them nor do after their works but thou shall utterly overthrow them and quite break down their images and you shall serve the Lord your God and he shall bless your bread and your water and I will take sickness away from the midst of Thee now this is part of the newer Covenant this part of the atonement taking sickness away by whose stripes we were healed then he says in verse 26 there shall nothing cast their young no sheep no cow no Ox no goat no human there shall nothing cast their young nor be barren in thy land the number of thy days I will fulfill I will send my fear before thee and will destroy all of the people to whom thou shall come and I will make thine enemies turn their backs unto thee and I'll send Hornets before thee which shall drive out the Highlight the Canaanite the hittite from before thee and he goes on to say I'm not going to drive him out in a year lest you can't occupy the land but little by little but this is a promise not only for the corn and the beans and the the vine the the fruit on the vine or the fruit trees but this is a promise that God made that there should be none that would cast their young now for a lady a miscarriage is a horrible horrible thing and I don't want to get on a sensitive subject here miscarriage is horrible yet I believe that there is a promise in the word of God that we can lay hold to I believe this is a promise for the elect lady that there doesn't have to be miscarriage I don't understand all of the ways of God don't understand why he chooses to do that sometimes but I'm seeing a promise in the word of God that he said he was going to rebuke the Devourer for our sake and he told that to them after he's rebuking them because they have robbed him but if they were willing to restore to him what belonged to him and get all of the intercession back in its rightful place all of the divine order back in its place he's saying that you just watch and see if I won't pour you out of blessing that you will not have room enough to receive and I will destroy the deviled rebuke the devour for your sake and he shall not destroy the fruit of your ground neither shall your Vine cast our fruit before the time I believe this is a promise that we should be able to hold on to because if if we're in Covenant with God the way that we're supposed to be and if I am reading this if I'm comprehending this scripture right here that he was telling them they were robbing him and in essence they were robbing their own blessing by withholding their tithe and their offering but if they were willing to restore to God what belonged to him see this is not just about money people this is about offering our whole self to the Lord our tithe and our offering and not just money but our entire self to the Lord Jesus Christ when it looks like that there's chaos and loss as it was with Abraham as it has been in your life when it looks like the Devourer has come in and he has gotten the upper hand in your life what did Abraham do did he run away from God Abraham always came back to God and at the appointed time when Abraham came back to God El Shaddai showed up the breasted God and how many times did we hear Brother Branham say we just need to lay our head on his bosom and nurse strength from El Shaddai and when we feel that fear feeling of failure when we know that we've gone astray when we know that we have uh exhibited attributes of unbelief and God comes to us and he says to us come back near to me you're robbing me what do you mean Lord I'm robbing you I pay my tithe but you're robbing me you're robbing me of your time you're robbing me of my praise you're robbing me you come in the house of the Lord and you don't open your mouth you don't lift your hands you don't exhibit you don't put forth any effort to help to draw the presence of the Lord and you're robbing me and in essence you're robbing yourself and when God reveals that to you we do not have to sit around for 10 years and feel guilt and condemnation we have the blessing of saying Lord I recognize it thank you for showing it to me I Repent I come back to you and now I just need to draw up real close to you and nurse strength from you I know it's the only way that I can get back to where I need to be El Shaddai musicians coming please verse 7 was an invitation that God gave to the people return unto me they gave back the words in what way have we robbed you or how rather rather how it shall we return to you God says return their response was how should we return to you and he said you've been a thief and now in verse 13 He says your words have been Stout against me Stout in this context is the same Hebrew word that is used when it says that Pharaoh hardened his heart against the Lord so the people give the response what if we spoken so much against you and God's response to them was you've said it's vain to serve the Lord you said what prophet is it that we've kept your ordinances and why have we walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts the words that they used against God God said it's just like Pharaoh hardening his heart you have said what prophet is it we give you modern day terms what's the use we would never admit that we said it to God but those words have come out of our mouth why should I even try what's the use I can't get it right and these kinds of words are stout against the Lord God recognizes that it's a hardening of our heart toward him and he wants to deal with it what prophet is it that we have kept your ordinances what has it profited us to live differently from all the rest of the church world what prophet is it that we've kept these ordinances these are words that have come out of our mouths and God in that time said this was because of hard-heartedness Stout words against him and the third thing was what profit is it that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts now this word mournfly has an indication of what we might would call the black sheep of the family what profit is it that we are so different from everybody else none of the rest of the family likes us we dress differently we act differently we do things differently at church and who they they do they think it's all a bunch of nonsense that we run and shout and speak in tongues and lift our voices and live differently and we don't put on a little makeup here and act like Justin Bieber over there and on and on and on and on it goes and I just would encourage you to not let your words bestowed against the Lord the things that you say and remember when uh toward the start we talked about how that it was necessary to keep the Commandments of God before our eyes before our children to teach him to our children this was going to be multi-generational blessing that God wanted to pour out and it was necessary for the parents and the grandparents to keep this uh these Commandments before the children at all times keep them before our own eyes all the time the enemy wants us to deviate our eyesight in our minds he wants to deviate them to go a different direction while the Lord is wanting us to stay right on the straight path because he has a he has a plan for us he has a prefix Destiny for us he has a promise that he wants to pour out on your head and so he wants your cooperation in this in this whole thing he wants your cooperation and so he needs you to keep the command ever before you so that you don't start out offering him Stout words when you see other people that look like they live a whole lot looser than you do and it looks like that they have all kinds of a fancy how do you Do's in their life and it looks like that even though they don't pay tithe they have all kinds of blessing don't let your words become Stout against the Lord you remember that they have no intercession on their behalf all the good that it looks like that they have right now is one day going to come to a screeching halt but when you're walking under the blessing in the intercession of the Holy Spirit when you have everything in divine order and you're walking under the blessing of God because you're keeping Covenant with him and everybody is in their rightful place then the blessings can come into your life and it may not look like the blessing or the the the shiny stuff that all of the world has yet you can know that you're walking all of this may fade away whether you're rich or poor it's all going to fade away and one day you're going to step out of this body his body is going to drop and you are going to pick up a new one or else the rest of the Dead live not for a thousand years but then they come up before a judgment seat and I do not want to be found there I don't believe that is where I'll be found I believe that my judgment is happening right now on this Earth let's Stand Together there's more to cover here we'll see how that goes perhaps we'll finish it or perhaps it'll be like some of brother Shelley's sermons never got finished but I can't keep you here all day father how we thank you for your word we thank you Lord that you are working in us both to Will and to do of your good pleasure God I thank you that you have called us and you have placed your seal upon us you have placed your hand of protection upon us and God you have given us uh uh uh a place where that we are safe sheltered in the hand of God and it's because that you have allowed us to see the necessity for the proper intercession for everything to be in its divine order and we're thankful Lord for that order I thank you that we don't have to live our lives in chaos we don't have to live our lives in disorder we can live our lives under the blessing of the almighty God and know that you are pouring out blessings that this body this body cannot contain them Lord there's some of them no doubt that you withhold because we would explode because this physical body could not contain it yet you have prepared us a glorious body one to contain deity one to contain so much more than what we have right now and Lord we are looking forward to that but until that day we will rejoice with pleasure knowing that you have called us with a high and a holy calling you have invited us to bring our tithe and our offerings our our tithe that belongs to you and our offering Lord the people have brought today to help with the mortgage of this property the Lord they didn't only bring Financial offering they brought an offering of Praise they brought an offering of an amen they brought an offering of a an attentiveness to the word of God they brought an offering of being willing to lay aside all of the unbelief that they were dealing with outside and coming into the house of the Lord and offering themselves now father I ask you to take the word and the obedience as you see fit and pour out blessing now as we worship you together may you pour out your blessing Lord you see the needs of the people you see the blessings that are needed God I'm asking you I'm asking you that you will come and that you will bless the people in the way that they need blessed at this moment thou who knowest yesterday from today from tomorrow I am asking you that you will even now let the blessings of Heaven Fall Down In This Place those that are watching the stream of this service let the blessings fall to them that they need God you know those that are Covenant
