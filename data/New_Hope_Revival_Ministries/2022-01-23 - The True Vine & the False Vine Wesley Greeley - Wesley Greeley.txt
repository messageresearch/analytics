prayer today and take our needs to the lord if you look around you can see that there are many that are missing from among us and we want to remember them to the lord today i was glad to see brother

praising the lord for that we want to remember uh sister sharon's grandson beau and his wife caroline they lost their baby and they've got a huge hospital bill facing them and don't have a baby and so this is very very difficult for them we want them to turn to the lord and rely on our father at this point at this time they'd look away to jesus and see all of the ways that papa wants to love on

would pray for us we'll be in iowa brother daniel miller is from idaho we're going to iowa to brother brooks to preach next weekend and so we would appreciate your prayers starting in verse six and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also to her husband with her and he did eat the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where art thou and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself and he said who told thee that thou was naked hast thou eaten of the tree where have i commanded thee that thou should us not eat and the man said the woman whom thou gave us to be with me she gave me of the tree and i did eat and the lord god said unto the woman what is this that thou has done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and i did eat chapter 4 verse 1 and adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bear cain and said i have gotten a man from the lord and she again bare his brother abel and abel was a keeper of sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground and in the process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the fruit of the ground and offering unto the lord and abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel and to his offering but unto cain and to his offering he had not respect and cain was very wroth and his countenance fell i'm reading through verse 10 and the lord said unto cain why are you wroth and why is your countenance fallen if thou doest well shall thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shall rule over him cain talked with abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother and slew him and the lord said unto cain where is abel thy brother and he said i know not am i my brother's keeper and he said what have you done and the voice of the he he said what have you done the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground may the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may have your seats today i got started on this little journey that i'm about to minister to you today from a message that brother branham preached in 1956 he was talking about the true vine and the false fine in fact that's the name of the sermon the true and false vines but he made this statement if i was going to speak here next week there's one subject that i'd like to speak three questions of god where are you what is this you've done and where is your brother where are you he spoke to adam what is this that you have done he spoke to eve where is thy brother he spoke to cain three questions god asked think of it now as far as i know brother branham never preached a message involving those three questions directly but it set me on a journey and i asked myself why would brother adam want to preach a message concerning these three questions so it just started me on this little journey and and i began to think about this true vine and the false vine which is the name of this sermon where i got this thought and we know that the true vine and the false vine they grow sometimes together many times in the natural when you look out in the woods or around your house there are times where that we see that there are good vines and there are bad vines that are growing together and in the course of time they weave themselves around one another and they we we can't distinguish the one vine from the other vine and the only and and sometimes you can't tell it from the bark you can't even sometimes tell it from the leaves you can't tell it from the pod that it may put out but when it comes to its full maturity there is a way that you can tell the difference and we find out that jesus in matthew chapter 13 when he was talking about the seed he said let them grow up together remember the the field with the wheat and somebody uh the evil one went through the field and spread tears when nobody was looking and they grew up and they looked alike and and somebody wanted to go and pluck up the tares he says no no no no you just let them grow up together and when they come to the maturity then we're gonna let the distinguishing be done and so many times we we look at people because that's what we are we're people and we try to make a judgment call about whether somebody is weed or whether they are tares no just let them grow up together when it comes to maturity god will separate that all out he'll let that all be fixed up and it'll all be done right and there won't be any humanity mixed in with it there won't be any soul mixed in with it god will take care of that he is going to get that all right there won't be no wrong in that it'll be all right so adam here we find in the third chapter that now we we we want to just remind you and those that might be listening we welcome you to this service today may god bless you if there's something that you don't understand just lay it aside don't kick it out immediately just lay it aside but we find in god's word that there are times that not everything is said there are many times that god gives us information in one place and then he puts a little bit more of the information in another place and maybe a little bit more in another place and after a while by the grace of god and the goodness of him sending his revelation he starts to put the picture all together to help us to come up with a complete picture now the bible said that the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field so that gives us an idea that this serpent did not start out on the ground but this was a beast with a beast nature but somehow he had the ability to communicate with the woman and that is where he started now we remember that the woman was not a part of that original creation in that she was a separate entity she was inside of adam and god after a while he pulled that rib out of adam and he created from the dust he created this woman and if you read you see that when god gave the instruction if i remember correctly when god gave the instruction about the tree of knowledge of good and evil and he gave them instruction about what should be taken and what should not be taken she was still inside of adam but the instruction got to her you be sure of that the instruction got to her so now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he came to her with a temptation and in that temptation he drew her away from the purposes and the plan of god and when he did that there was a falling away there was a falling from the place that they were to a lower place and as we were singing let the glory fall in this room today there was a glory about them that was their covering and so when adam was after he had also partaken of this and the eyes of them both were opened god came through the garden in the cool of the evening as he had always done and he went looking for his children crying out to adam adam where are you now we've got to remember something when god asks a question he doesn't need information [Music] when god asks a question he already knows the answer when god asks a question it is something to shake you to think about what he's asking and what your motives are behind what you're doing and so when he comes into the garden and he realizes that that adam and his wife they are not as accessible maybe as they usually are they're hiding themselves and he says adam where are you and adam had a response as we generally do and he said i heard your voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself isn't this generally what we try to do when god comes to us and he begins to inquire of us and we have pulled away from him and the the the glory of the lord has become dimmed in our life and when he comes to us can he asks where are you and we respond with a justification of some sort or we make up an excuse or we hide because we're trying to justify our guiltiness at that moment but because he's a loving papa his desire is not to come and to crush us his desire is to come and cause us to recognize where we are so that we may repent so that we can get back to our original estate he doesn't want to leave us in our downtrodden place he doesn't want to leave us down and out and cold and uncovered he wants us to be covered so he we we know that through the preaching of the word over the course of years that they they had a covering of a supernatural substance and the glory of the lord covered them and and and when they partook of the tree of knowledge of good and evil there was something that happened that caused them to drop out of the level of supernatural into a level of natural humanity that they were not originally created for and so as adam [Music] recognizes that something has changed something has shifted in his life and immediately he tries to cover himself and there is nothing that we can ever find in the natural surroundings that is good enough to cover us up to hide us to hide our nakedness from the from the from the wrath of god or from the goodness of god it's just nothing there that is enough for us to cover up but when god cries out adam where are you and he decided that he wanted to cover himself up and and that's that's generally what we try to do and we have when adam fell out of that supernatural realm into a natural realm and god comes looking for him god expected them to stay in the supernatural realm now nothing catches god by surprise nothing ever causes him to have to back up and say how am i going to get around this but he wanted adam to stay in a natural in the supernatural realm but yet something inside of this human inside of this man that was placed on the earth was there was something in him that god created and god allowed and when god came asking adam where are you adam had tried to cover himself up with something that was natural something in this realm and the natural left him naked without a covering adam tried to cover himself with something that he found in the realm where he was but it was not sufficient to cover him in a way that god thought was sufficient to cover him and so now this being adam he is now this supernatural clothing that he wore is is now either totally gone or it's in a lesser amount and he has fallen into a place where that now he is exposed to the elements of the earth in such a way that uh god found him in that condition and he knew that adam was now very susceptible to the attacks of the enemy because that he did not have the proper covering and we know that god has created us to walk in a supernatural realm i was made for that and we have been told that we bypassed a theophany body to come to this earth a celestial body we bypass that to come to this earth to demonstrate our love for our lord and that then when we were finished with this body here on the earth that we would pick up that celestial body he also said in one place that we would pick up when we die that we would pick up that celestial body and that we would stay in that celestial body until the great catching away and then we would go catch up with that glorified body now i don't have the full understanding of that but this one thing i know i was created not just for this realm but i was more created for a supernatural realm we give this phrase i'll speed up and they'll slow down and brother branham gave this statement he he was talking about a statement that einstein had made and and einstein gave this thought that if two vehicles could go fast enough and come toward each other that they could pass through each other now i haven't studied einstein i don't know all of that but then he gave another statement and he said they've got a sputnik that they're so proud of anybody know what a sputnik is probably not very many people know what sputnik is well in 57 1957 the russians the ussr at the time decided to put a satellite in space and that satellite was about as big as a beach ball and if i recall they said that that sputnik it was a satellite and that it could orbit the earth in 98 hours minutes 98 minutes so they were real proud of the speed of that sputnik how fast that it could go but you'll remember when jesus after he had after he had descended into lower parts of the earth and he ascended to the father but he came back after he had been glorified he came back to the uh maybe he hadn't been glorified he come back anyhow to his disciples and he passed through the wall such a speed that he was going that the wall didn't hinder him and so that is the kind of supernatural that god had created adam to be and he adam was created and put in the garden to be a creator he was put there to be able to be able to enter into time and space and perhaps to come back out of time and space with ease just as jesus did in and out of time and space back into eternity out time and space back to eternity see this is what we were really created for and so when adam found himself in this place and god comes to him and says where are you and adam says i was naked and i had to hide myself from you and and i realized that there's something that has happened and so uh god said fig leaves ain't gonna work big leaves aren't going to be enough then you go to the book of the revelation when when when the angel was speaking to john concerning the laodicean church age and he told the he recognized and told that the people were poor wretched blind and naked and they didn't know it now adam had enough sense to recognize that he was naked and he tried to cover himself up when god came asking this question where are you adam was trying to cover himself up and so often we we think of ways that people try to cover themselves up with their religious ideas and it doesn't work because religious ideas will never clothe you properly enough for you to speed back up into supernatural jesus said i counsel of you to buy of me gold tried in the fire and white raiment that the shame of your nakedness does not appear there's something about the glory of god that he's inviting us to come back into when he asked the question to adam where are you he had no desire for adam to stay in that place nor did he ever have desire for adam's race to stay in that place and so because all of this had happened he already had a plan put in motion it's already put in motion but to start with there had to be the bloody skins of the lamb to be placed upon their backs because fig leaves was not sufficient we move on after adam gives his his thought as to why that he's trying to cover himself up when god comes to ask him where he is the man the woman of course adam put some of the blame over on her the woman you gave me she gave me of the tree and i did eat because god has added revelation on revelation we know that this is a type of what is to come this is the nature of christ to to cover uh to cover and and that's what adam was doing here but when god comes and asks him about it is that woman so the lord said unto the woman what is this that you have done she did the same kind of thing that adam i mean they were both hiding behind the fig leaves both of them were and her answer or her fig leaf her excuse her response back to god was the serpent beguiled me now again i say remember when god asks a question he already knows the answer he doesn't need my excuse he doesn't need your excuse he is trying to get us to when god asks a question he is trying to get us to understand uh that that we are not in our proper place we're not in our truest form and he is desiring to pull us to a place where that his sweet holy spirit can renew us once again and so many times we offer god excuses god comes and asks us a question we always got to have an answer it's human nature the best thing we could do would be to fall on our face say lord i am sorry but the question to the woman was what is this that you have done and she responded the serpent beguiled me and i did eat now i want you to think about this question that god has just asked her because what have you done had ramifications for all the way up till now and until we're caught up out of this place and until god comes and cleanses the earth with fire now when we read the book of genesis we can see that there are the beasts of the field we can see that there are the fish of the water we can see that there are birds of the air but none of those species had the ability to speak and create only adam had the ability to speak and create is that correct so now when god poses this question to the woman and i say the woman because she does not yet have her own name she is still very much a part of adam under one name that is why we baptize him part of the reason we baptize in the name of the lord jesus christ because it's one name he's bringing us the bride and the groom together under one name i don't carry my own i carry his so all of these beasts of the field fish of the air and then fowl of the or fowl of the air and fish of the sea they don't have a voice to create but god gave away for adam his voice to create it so happened that a tree might need to be moved be thou moved over here the voice of creation was in adam but now because of this fall when god asks the woman this question what is this that you have done she said the serpent beguiled me i want you to think about this because the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field the beast of the field again when this happened was not crawling around on the ground as a snake or serpent as we know it today but it was the curse that god laid upon that beast because of what he did whether it was a spirit that pressed its way into the serpent and used the serpent's body and voice to speak i don't know exactly how that all of that looked in detail but the serpent was used to speak to the woman and because of that the beast was put on its belly the rest of its days now i want you to notice here because what have you done [Music] god is asking her a question and all of the sudden can you imagine this thought as god asks this question what have you done because of what you have done you have lowered the human race to the level of obese nature that that's what she did right if you believe what i believe she partook of the nature of the beast and then she went and offered it to her husband and when she offered it to her husband they now are at a lower place than they were remember the covering is gone from them they are now in a lower form i i don't know maybe how long that it took for them to become afraid of of the beasts of the field uh not just the one that was subtle but the lion and the cheetah and the fox and anything that we now would think of that might harm a human being uh how soon that they might have become afraid of that but they're now reduced to a lower level but again god did not ask this question because he wanted them to remain in that lower form he asked this question because he wanted her to recognize what she had done he she was he was drawing her to a place of repentance just as he does for you just as he does for me he wants he is desiring for us to come to a place of repentance so after this happened and he begins to let her know that she is now in a uh she is really got a beast nature and let's be real honest without christ that's what we have it doesn't take much to recognize this that is what humanity is yes there are a lot of good people but at the base of it there is the beast nature and so god speaks to her and says in sorrow you shall bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee now this is a this is something that doesn't fly too high in 2022. and i don't know whether you have recognized it or not but has anybody recognized how many women have gotten into politics i mean it seems like every time you turn around another woman is being elected to a political office i am not a male chauvinist i am not somebody that doesn't think that they are fully capable but i am uh perceptive enough in the scripture to realize that this is probably not a good thing because it means that a woman is out of her god-given role when a woman is trying to usurp authority whether it's be in the household or whether it be in a job or whether it be in politics she is out of her position according to the word of god she is out of her position i know that that's probably not real good to say from the pulpit but this is the truth because that god said you are to be subject to your husband because of what you've done we can go to the new testament and we can see the apostle paul say that the women are to be the keepers at home they're supposed to be taking care of their children and and so uh for a while that's the way it was and and the enemy found out that beast nature remember this is the beast nature says well in order for us to get the woman out from under the rule of the man once again what we have to do is we've got to make things so hard till people think that they've got to have two incomes in order to support the household we got to be able to get the woman out of the house we got to send the children down to egypt to school and we got to make sure that we keep them all so out of sorts and out of their proper roles until that the woman is no longer in her proper place now men if you mistreat your wife you're wrong you are wrong [Music] your wife is to be your queen your sweetheart she is to be treated with utmost respect she is to be treated with honor in the home and she has her proper place in the home in fact brother branham says she is a pastor to her children so ladies if you have children in the home you are the shepherd to those children and god gave you a god-ordained place there to shepherd those children to instill in those children godly principles godly thought godly goodness and when a husband can stand behind his wife stand with her in training those children friends if we don't train our children if we don't train them properly they're going to go off the rails and they're going to go after the beast nature because that's just it's what's in us we came to the world speaking lies we have a nature in us that goes after the lower things rather than the higher things but all thanks be to god there's something that god has already put in this earth and he they placed a calling in our lives and he said you parents hold the token over your children you just pray over them and hold the token over them if they're wayward then believe that god will bring them back if they're in your household hold the token over them don't let them go [Music] it's not all the preacher's job to teach these children because some of the things that we say from this desk goes over their head and it is the responsibility of the mom and the dad to be able to sit down with their children and break these things down a little bit further than we can as a body you know your children you know what their susceptibilities are you know what they're up against and so you as a parent have been given your children and god gave them to you because he knew that you had the qualities to be able to instill in them the word of god the goodness of god and so he's just allowing you to give him one more step in the word of god so that they will come to recognize that they also must repent and call on the name of the lord and be filled with the baptism of the holy ghost and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and follow on to know more and more of the truth of god so he told the woman i'm going to put enmity see this is some more of that where you got to read between the lines i'm going to put inmate between thee he said this to the serpent i'm going to put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed now when you read that you know that there had to be some seed somewhere i'm going to put enmity between you and the serpent and i'm going to put enmity between the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent and so we are about to see here that more of the beast nature is going to be magnified but god has an end purpose and god is always just in his judgments when we stand before the lord we can never say god you are unfair god is god doesn't operate in time god operates in eternity and in eternity there is no time and so when we talk about a measure of time in this dimension to god it's just a puff of air a breath a millisecond it doesn't even register on his time clock if i lived to be 70 or 80 years 90 years 100 years it in eternity it's not hardly a blip as far as time is concerned but remember my name is on the lamb's book of life so i do matter and you matter what is this you've done what have you conceived now i've added there the scripture does not say what have you conceived god asked her what have you done i am adding this thought what have you conceived see she first had to receive it here proverbs 23 verse 6. eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye neither desire thou his dainty meats for as he thinketh in his heart so is he eden drink saith he to thee but his heart is not with thee the morsel which thou has eaten shall thou vomit it up and lose thy sweet words now i'm just going to throw this out because i believe this is another one of those ways that god lets us read between the lines we are talking about something that happened between the woman and the serpent and i just ask you what generally happens when a woman conceives the morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit it up and lose thy sweet words just a thought maybe i'm taking scripture out of context but let's go to another one proverbs chapter 30 verse 20. such is the way of an adulterous woman she eateth and wipeth her mouth and saith i have done no wickedness now why do we have to have adulteress in front of woman and what does eating have to do with wickedness sila what is this you've done you know i can't even begin to imagine the horrible feeling of darkness that must have descended down over these two individuals at this time they've already tried to hide themselves they have tried to give excuses as to why they're trying to cover up their nakedness and [Music] god is having none of it and he tells them that he's going to put enmity between the woman and her see and the woman and the serpent and her seed and his seed and he's gonna bruise your head and thou shalt bruise his heel we know this is talking of a future day and then we see that uh god tells adam that the ground is going to be cursed for his sake and in sorrow he's going to eat all all the days of his life there's going to be thorns and thistles he's going to have to work by the sweat of his face uh and all of this is a change for them this is not the same joy that they had previously where that they had the power of the spoken word they have fallen from that original estate now because of what the woman has done that adam has also partaken of they are both naked god asks them the question where are you and what have you done but god always makes a way and he placed upon them these bloody skins and he protected the way to the tree of life the cherubim with the flame and sword were placed there lest they should go and partake of that tree and live forever in their fallen state god had to protect them see that's the mercies of god god could have let us go to hell he could have allowed us or said to us you're as bad as the next one i have no place for you but somewhere by the mercies of god he looked ahead in time and he saw that i would make a right choice somewhere along the way that he could give me a by the foreknowledge of god he could give me a prefix destiny he knew that i would be willing to call on him somewhere along the way so then we go on to chapter four adam knew his wife and she conceived and bear cain and said i have gotten a man from the lord we know that all life comes from god he is the creator the enemy is not the creator and she again bear his brother abel and abel was a keeper of sheep but cain was the tiller of the ground and in the process of time cain brought of the fruit of the ground now i just told you the previous chapter tells us that god told adam that the ground would be cursed for his sake now cain is bringing an offering of the fruit of the ground and he tries to offer it to the lord process of time that means they had to grow up become old enough to recognize that there was a necessity to bring an offering to the lord they brought their offering to the lord cain brought of the fruit of the ground the ground that was cursed and abel brought to firstling of his flocks and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel and to his offering but unto cain and his offering he had not respect and cain was very wrought and his countenance fell and so the lord starts asking him these questions why are you so mad why is your countenance fallen if you do well won't you be accepted and if not sin lies at the door and so we see then that cain came to talk to his brother abel abel's sacrifice was accepted i want you to see here if you don't already know adam and the woman adam and his wife they attempted to take something of the fruit of the ground to cover up their nakedness god came to them and told them that won't work and he took a lamb and he placed these bloody skins on them to cover up their nakedness as they are growing up i am sure that they were told the story of how that they had fallen from their place that they were and adam would tell how that he tried to hide from god and how that god came and found them and posed this question to them and asked his mother you know what are you doing and why have you done this and that bloody skins were necessary god chose the bloody skins to cover them up i don't know how many times the bible doesn't even record that they ever told the children that this is what had happened this is where you have to read between the lines and you have to uh use some some thought about how that you instruct your children you tell your children stories of your childhood you tell your stories of when you were an adolescent or a young married couple and things that went wrong and things that went right you just tell these stories to your children and so i'm making a supposition that that is indeed what adam and eve did with their children they told these stories of how we we you know we weren't real smart we just knew that we were naked and and we tried to cover ourselves up and we we went and found the biggest leaf we could find to try to cover ourselves because we knew that god was going to come down and and we felt our nakedness and so we looked for something to cover ourselves up but god came around and he said that that ain't going to work that that religion that we tried was not going to work that natural stuff that we tried was not going to work that it was going to take something more that it was going to take a bloody sacrifice in order to cover up what i had done perhaps these stories were told to the children but in the process of time the boys recognized that they needed to make sacrifice to the lord both of them came to the lord but cain brought of the fruit of the ground abel brought a lamb divine revelation divine understanding just listening to his mom and dad i don't know i'd like to think that it was divine revelation because he had paid attention to his daddy he and he heard the instruction of his dad through the years that there's no way son there is no way in your own abilities that you could ever come up with enough religion to cover up your nakedness or to cover your sin there is nothing that you can do to make that possible you have got to have the blood of the lamb on you you have got to have blood and maybe cain he you know because he was of that wicked one the scripture says he was of that wicked one he thought that he could do it his way and he tried just the same way that adam and and he did you know took of the fruit of the ground and which was already cursed and he brought it to the lord and god did not have respect to his offering and it caused cain to resent his brother and so he called his brother out into the field and he slew his brother and god comes and asks him this question where is abel my brother what was his answer the first answer he gave was a lie i don't know where's your brother i don't know how many times have we gave the same kind of an answer when we for sure knew but we're trying to avoid a punishment but again god does not ask a question because he wants to crush you underneath god is asking a question because he's trying to draw you to repentance where is abel thy brother i don't know am i my brother's keeper so now he has a lie and he all adds to it an irresponsible flippant answer am i my brother's keeper he has a resentment against his brother because god accepted the sacrifice of his brother and now he has a resentment that he's even being asked so asked about it but he has so much of the beast nature in him that he's trying to cover himself up again with fig leaves now i want you to look at this with me just a second god asks adam where are you he asked the woman what is this you've done and he asks cain where is your brother and we already know what has happened to his brother john 10 10 says that keith the the thief cometh not but for to steal to kill and to destroy the thief cometh not but for to steal what happened here with adam where are you adam his covering had been taken away to steal we go to destroy for eve because when she accepted what the serpent was saying to her the beguiling of the serpent there was the thief was after a destruction of the very nature of god in humanity that was what he was after and to kill we know that that is what cain did to his brother abel but cain says i don't know i don't know am i my brother's keeper remember luke chapter 10 jesus was being questioned and he's telling believe the rich young ruler he's talking to him rich young ruler says who is my neighbor luke chapter 10 let's get it right luke chapter 10 verse 25 a certain lawyer stood up tempted him saying master what shall i do to inherit eternal life he said unto him what is written in the law how read us thou and he said he answering said thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy strength with all thy mind and thy neighbor as thyself and he said unto him thou has answered right this do and thou shall live but he said but he oh oh this looks like what cain did but he willing to justify himself said unto jesus who's my neighbor jesus answering said a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thieves who stripped him of his raiment wounded him departed leaving him half dead by chance there came down a certain priest that way when he saw him he passed by on the other side and likewise a levite when he was at that place came and looked on him and passed by on the other side but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him went to him bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine set him on his own beast brought him to the end took care of him and on the morrow when he departed he took out two pence gave it to the host and said to him take care of him whatever you spend more when i come again i'll repay you which now of these three thinketh thou was neighbor unto him that fell among the thieves and he said he that showed mercy on him then said jesus unto him go and do thou likewise now we can see in the instance with cain he gave an answer because he uh he already knew but again this was a response when god asks you a question he's trying to draw you to a place of repentance to give a truthful answer about things but see friends this is what we continue to do as humanity we try to hide behind things and we try to uh uh we we try to um make it till that these things that we're hiding behind we use excuses we use different things to try to uh tell the lord i'm all right i'm all right i'm all right when when reality god is wanting us to give ourselves so fully unto him till that we say i messed up i messed up and i want to come clean with you lord and i want to have so much cleanness in me until that you can again clothe me with the supernatural see friends the bride is going to come to that place she is coming to that place she is in the process the judgment seat of christ is among us and he is allowing us to go through a judgment right here and he's beckoning us to to repentance he's beckoning us to give more of ourselves to him because he desires for us to be once again clothed with himself throughout history god would raise up righteous seed and the enemy was always present to try to destroy that seed when it came up against jesus christ he came up against brother branham said when the devil hit jesus he hit a 10 000 volt line and it singed his feathers and that is the way that adam was adam had that much authority but because he covered his wife he stepped out from under that and he had to try to cover himself with fig leaves now the thief comes to steal to kill and to destroy where are you what have you done and where is your brother jesus has come that we might have life and that we might have it more abundantly the enemy is always out to steal to kill and to destroy and when you find the holy spirit coming to you whether it would be something that you hear whispered in your spirit whether it's something that you recognize when you're reading the word of god when you hear it across the pulpit when you hear it in a recorded sermon when you hear the holy spirit asking you a question where are you what have you done you see my lord is not the accuser of the brethren he does not come to ask you a question to accuse you because there's already somebody that is doing that and doing it with spectacular quality every day accusations of the enemy you don't believe me why are you going through such a mind battle because you have allowed the accuser of the brethren i have allowed the accuser of the brethren to remain accusing me when really i have the authority by the baptism of the holy ghost to put him back in his place but he is daily accusing me even when i know that i have gone off the track a little bit when i have failed the lord a little bit and the enemy is there accusing me but the lord comes to asks me and asks me the question where are you what have you done it is not because he desires for me to remain in that place or to go even lower it is because that he is a redeemer and he desires to bring me back to my place that i was originally thought of in his mind where that i have the spoken word once again operating in its fullness in my mouth it's there but he can't allow me to use it in its fullness because he can't yet trust me to use it in its infancy in my life otherwise the accuser wouldn't keep you know but i'm gaining ground you're gaining ground and we're recognizing that the thief comes to steal to kill to destroy but jesus has come that we could have life and that we could have it more abundantly and he's asking us the question because he wants us to come to a place that we're repenting before him i want to be so in love with jesus christ until that i am so aware when i do something wrong that i do not have to get into a twisted up place where that he comes and he asks me a question what are you doing where is your brother where are you at why are you remaining in this low place why can't you let go of your bitterness why can't you rise above the place that you've been see god i don't want him to have to come to me the way that he did to adam i want him to be able to guide me with his eye i want to be able to be so aware of his sweet spirit that i if i do get myself in trouble that i immediately repent while the musicians come i'm just going to throw this in here we have talked in time past about the seven spirits of god isaiah chapter 11 verse 1 and 2 this was not in my notes but i'd like to read it into the record isaiah chapter 11 verse 1 and 2. and there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of jesse and a branch shall grow out of his roots the spirit of the lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the lord the seven spirits of god we would talk here about what i want to dwell on is the last phrase there the fear of the lord the fear of the lord many many times i can hear brother branham preaching and he would say what are you so afraid of why are you so afraid but he wasn't talking about being afraid of the lord he's talking about being afraid of everything around you afraid of cancer afraid of the dark afraid of this afraid of that he wanted us to have a reverential fear of the lord and there is coming a reverential fear or awe of the lord that is going to come among us and god is dealing with all of these issues in our life the the the mind battle the issues of the mind the brain how that god has given us these tools to bring every thought into captivity to the word of god and we have continued to allow the enemy to run over top of us we have not utilized the tools that god has given us we have not uh we haven't mastered that and and i have no stones to throw i i put myself in this crowd with you we have we have not mastered this and we continue to battle from day to day and when things are said because we have let our thoughts run rampant we sometimes resent what is said we resent these things and god gives a space of ignorance but he's going to deal with them he's going to deal with every issue of our life and we're going to walk in irreverence and reverential awe of the lord to where that he can come to us and we bow ourself before him rather than offering excuses to the lord like adam did like eve did like cain did but we come with a holy reverence before god and say i release everything that i am holding on to but these resentments now perhaps they were so close to being formed so close to the original creation that when god came and asked them this question that they were able to survive but as humanity has come farther and farther away from the original creation and she uh eats stuff that's not good for her and her body is broken down and our hearts are weaker than they used to be and our our everything about us is weaker than it used to be but the fear of the lord is going to be among us and god is dealing piece by piece with us and he's coming to you asking questions of you not because he's coming as the accuser but because he is desiring for you to get everything under the blood of jesus christ every bit of it he's desiring for me to be under the blood of jesus christ but when the fear of god comes among us when god lets that come in its fuller measure and we throw up a resentment to the word of god the bible tells us that men's hearts are failing for fear and it's not just going to be out there is that what ananias will look like i don't know because i'm just telling you i don't want to have to ever be one to pronounce judgment on somebody but when the holy ghost comes among us in such heavy doses as he has promised to in the end time and we continue to throw up our excuses before the lord and we throw up our excuses to the lord i don't know what will happen does that mean you lose your salvation i'm not going there but what i would say friends is god is encouraging us to have everything brother shelley says so often all the dead cats off the line all the dead cats off the line you know when i was growing up play something to help me shut up please when i was a child my neighbor had an electric fence keep the cows in it was two strands of smooth electric wire galvanized electric wire as a child i helped to dig holes to put the posts in i tried to drive the nails through the insulators but when he got done installing that fence the object was that if the cow would come up and touch that wire he'd get shocked and it helped to keep him inside the fence now i was there more than once when mr davis would take a young calf that he wanted to put out to pasture and put a rope around that calf and he'd take that calf up to that fence and put his nose his wet slobbery nose to that electric fence because he was trying to teach that calf you don't want to press against that wire there is a boundary for you to stay inside of and this electric wire is around this boundary now what i found out as i was growing up was that my neighbor would go around and he this is years ago he didn't have a string trimmer you know the gas string trimmer he had a pair of shears and he would go along that fence and if any grass was growing up too high anything that would cause that wire to be grounded [Music] he would cut it down because he wanted the voltage to go through that wire as strongly as possible to keep that cow inside of that wire many many times there is a voltage between us and the holy spirit there is a there is a current we'll say there is a current between us and the holy spirit and we allow some things to grow up in our lives that are grounding that current they're slowing the current down they're causing that current to become less and less and less and that's when we find ourselves in the traps of the enemy because we have become grounded we have allowed things to ground us till that the current is not strong as it used to be so i would encourage us as a body of believers to let the holy spirit come with his shears today and shear all of that stuff that is causing us to be grounded and let the current get back strong again would you stand to your feet the things of earth will grow strangely dim in the light of his glory sing again oh turn your eyes upon [Music] full face and the things of earth will grow strangely [Music] perhaps you have something you want to talk to the lord about and you'd come and join us around the front here today turn your eyes upon [Music] look for all in his wonder full face and the things of earth will grow strangely dim in the light now remember any time the holy spirit draws you it's not because he wants to make you feel like slop it is because he wants to repair it he wants to take care of it get us back to full current once again so let's pray together wherever you are you pray in your own language your own words you know what you're dealing with you talk to the lord about it lord as these have gathered around the front of this building today perhaps there are those on the stream that wish they could come and gather with us we just come in the lovely name of the lord jesus christ god we know we can't fix ourselves we don't have the ability but we come putting ourselves on your mercy and ask you lord that you will go deep into our minds our hearts our soul you find those things lord that we throw up and resent truth when it comes our way you know how to put your finger on it lord [Music] those things that we allow to stay in our lives that cuts down on the holy ghost current lord i'm asking you cleanse me o god cleanse me of it [Music] i pray o lord that you will give grace this moment in my life lord i don't want to be disrespectful to your word i don't want to disrespect your servants i want to honor lord give honor where honor is due i want to honor my brother my sister [Music] lord when one is down and you come and ask me where is your brother god may i not just offer excuse lord may i be one who is willing to give a cup of cold water [Music] to dress someone who is naked lord not just a natural nakedness there are so many who are naked spiritually and they don't even know it father if i can be used to help to dress someone by the word of god i pray that you will give me the grace and the courage and the strength to be able to do it [Music] any seeds of rebellion any seeds of resentment any seeds of disrespect [Music] seeds lord that have been put there by the accuser of the brethren god root them out i pray [Music] if they must mature oh lord [Music] god may i see them with spirit eyes may they be harvested and throwed into the fire of the holy spirit and consumed [Music] i need the [Music] so bless me [Music] i need [Music] jesus [Music] me [Music] thank you lord thank you lord can you lift your hands to the lord just say thank you lord [Music] i want to honor you and give you praise that you have come to me that you love me so much you don't want me to remain in the place i was
