same yesterday today and reever I know you've been up and down forgive us but would you be seated just for one moment here we're just so thankful that you're in the house of God I know that uh it seems a little loud up here I know that some of you have made a sacrifice you were enjoying your family so much and you left your family yesterday some drove nearly all day to be here for service this morning I want you to know it's not unnoticed I said it to the musicians in the back as we prayed together this morning there were several of them who were away and they could have just you know had fellowship with their family gone to church with their family this morning but they had a sense of uh uh of Duty they wanted to be here to to to be faithful to to be to be at their post of Duty to be loyal and I appreciate that more than we would even have words to say and we needed them here this morning with so many missing uh I wanted to to say that I hope all of you had a wonderful Thanksgiving and uh I didn't take my scale I took my coffee to we took our coffee machine but I left one thing at home I left the scale this was one few days I didn't want to know body fat percentage muscle percentage I didn't even want to know how much water I had in me I left it at home but this morning it screamed three and a half pounds that's just wrong but but what can you expect when you have uh when you have peon pie for breakfast and it's it's the only time we you just sort of let your hair down you know for Thanksgiving week I don't have much to let down but anyway God is good we were blessed the whole highlight of my week I enjoyed being with both of my daughters and my wife my sons were elsewhere my daughter-in-law and and our grandbaby but we enjoyed being with them so much in such a beautiful setting and uh then the highlight of it was last night when when they got home and Eliana come to see Pap and Nana well that that just made it all all go away missing and and uh we're just thankful to be in the house of God today I I only wanted to say just as a moment of tribute if you don't mind just just one minute um there was a funeral today that I certainly would have like to have been able to attend it was certainly in my heart to be there but I needed to be here today instead 92 years old uh precious precious sister uh in our family in our life for so many years um you know there are many people out there who they may not be in the perfect will of God but they're doing God a service and uh we know what the scripture tells us about uh a woman's Ministry and and where where her Ministry is but I can't help but remember mothers in Zion like sister Bale 92 years old she assisted me when I when I preached my grandmother's funeral 32 years ago can you imagine she outlived my grandmother 32 years they were about the same age and uh this woman founded many churches for the Assemblies of God and and eventually her last church was was just an independent Hol in church still going strong today still dressing clean and looking right and Liv good and and uh I don't know how many times I have searched the internet for her obituary thinking surely she has passed and no one told me but I got a text from an old friend uh Friday I think it was to say that she had had crossed over and I just took it a little hard how can you take it hard when someone's 92 but but I'm not sad for her you know I I I can hear her voice when I think of her and I can see her rejoicing she loved for me to sing that song um um one more Valley she'd say we're not going home today until Steve sings One More Valley and I preached my first Revival meetings for her when I was 11 years old and preached first tent meetings in her on her church property when I was 12 the thing that I gathered from her life and uh I Pres presented baptism to her and I presented what God had done for us in the message of the hour and it didn't seem like there was maybe what she could see in it but I just loved her anyway and I knew that that she loved me but the thing that I remember about her the most is her hours of prayer and when I say that I'm not exaggerating she would spend the night with my grandmother sometime from out of town and and and she would pray until the we hours of the morning in the Holy Ghost and if you don't think that makes a difference in your life when you're a kid and you hear somebody praying and groaning in the spirit for hour upon hour it makes an impact on your life and I would just like for you to pray for her family she only had one son and one grandson but she had hundreds of of of church friends uh who loved her very much and who will miss her and um she taught me me a lot of spiritual things along the way she also taught me how amazing mayonnaise is on a hot dog you just don't forget those things I said sister Bell that sounds absolutely disgusting she said now honey I don't care what it sounds like you tried and if that don't make you just want to scream I didn't scream but I I sure appreciated what she taught me but most of all those spiritual things aren't you glad that God places people in our lives along the way to teach us what we need to know in a season aren't you glad that the pillar of fire keeps moving on and we keep following him to the fullness of his word but we shouldn't I tell you I don't despise where I came from all night prayer meetings and and bobby pins flying and uh people crawling around in the altar seeking the Lord I'm not embarrassed or ashamed of that that's where I come from that's really who I am I try to behave for some some folks sometime you know but really who I am uh I was most happy in that kind of environment I cannot stand to have to sit in the service that that there just seems to be no life you know they're saying all the right things but there's no life there there's no witness to what they're saying it's the life behind the name and we need that operating in our life today uh so I just wanted to say that forgive me for taking your time for some but you've heard me speak of her so many times through the years they told me that one week ago she was sitting up on the side of the bed talking to all the nurses and and telling them that they needed Jesus and that she was praying for them and and uh you need the Holy Ghost don't stop till you get the Holy Ghost don't just go to some church that don't pray for you to you need to get the holy ghost you you need to go all the way and then one week later she's there she made it the text that came in said uh brother Steve I just wanted you to know that sister Bell joined your grandmother this morning and they're rejoicing I believe it I believe it let's go to the word let's thank God for these musicians thank you let's stand for the reading of God's word proverbs 4 verse 23- 27 is where we have been for a couple of weeks now I want to move as quickly as I can I know you your time is uh valuable we want to Welcome All of You streamers I'm just taking a minute to glance here uh from all over the world God bless you in Cape Town God bless you in southern Norway God bless you in Indiana and and so so many places I wish that we had time uh to to greet you everyone by name and Country but we can't do that but we are very grateful that you are with us today by by stream this came from sort of a dream experience I had a few weeks ago where I I saw a person trying to get over a wall in a in in some kind of competition it seemed like and they had done quite well and were looking quite Fit until they came to a final wall and there was such a struggle in trying to get over that wall I recognized the person and there was such a such a struggle and and I began to sort of even in the dream pray for this individual and and the Lord just really impressed on my heart you need to tell that person Above All Else whatever you do guard your heart and that's what we have to do in the hour we're in right now your heart is not your blood pump I'm not talking about the blood pump I'm talking about the seed of the emotions and I want you to know that that's where the enemy wants to trick us or trouble us battle Us in this hour is in the Battlefield of the Mind If you believe that say Amen if you can win that battle because Jesus won it you can and if you will you'll have won the battle it'll be over that's it we're going out of here Proverbs 4:23 says keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life and that is telling us this morning that everything in life flows out of your heart the seat of your emotion your mind your will and your emotion everything that happens to you flows out of your heart and if that's if that's true then it emphasizes to us the importance of guarding our heart because the Bible said out of the abundance of the heart the mouth talks and if you don't want your mouth to over talk you've got to watch what's in your heart because out of the abundance of that heart your mouth will do its talking put away from thee verse 24 a frower mouth and perverse lips put far from thee let thine eyes look right on and let thine eyelids look straight before thee Ponder the path of thy feet and let all thy ways be what be established turn not to the right hand hand nor to the left remove thy foot from Evil sounds like really good advice to us this morning doesn't it and then if you will just give me one more moment uh I'd like for you to turn with me to one more place of scripture very familiar to you Ephesians chapter 6 beginning in verse 11 it says put on the whole armor of God the Greek says complete the complete Armor of God that ye may be able to stand against the Wilds of the devil is this to Believers it's to Believers for we wrestle not against Aunts Uncles cousins wives daughter laws come on we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places even government places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withand in the evil day and having done all not sit stand you've got to be on guard stand therefore having your loins GED about with truth truth matters and having on the breastplate of righteousness that's not your righteousness let me tell you what God thinks about my righteousness it's no more to him than filthy rags it's not the breastplate of the believer's righteousness it's the breastplate of the redeemer's righteousness his righteousness your feet Shaw with the preparation of the gospel of peace you're going to a battle you don't wear flipflops to a battle you've got to put on your peas shoes you've got to put on the the shoes the boots that will prepare you and protect you while going into the battlefield above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith ye shall be able to do what quench all the fiery darts of the wicked you may not always be able to stop them but you will definitely be able to put out the fire amen and many of them depending on how how good you are how much you've practiced you'll be able to stop some of them all together but how many of you are glad that what you don't stop with the shield of Faith there's something else protecting the believer and we're getting to that take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God do you believe that praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit when you get in the spirit you're not giving God your Santa Claus list when you get in the spirit you're praying a Jesus prayer as it is in heaven as it is in heaven as it is in heaven then Lord let it be done in me the same way you're not giving him your list you're saying your will be done amen thank God for that gift of prayer and supplication and thank God that we have in verse 14 the breastplate of righteousness father we thank you today that you have given us another opportunity to gather under your word I I see that of course people are have traveled and uh they're with weary and they're tired there is a refreshing that comes by the presence of the Lord would you send that to us today because we'll never get this moment back we'll never capture this particular service again if we don't give it what we have if we don't open up our heart to receive from you we may receive in dozens of other services but we'll miss what you had for us today so we come to attention by the spirit and we stand Lord ready to hear the instruction that you have for us today thank you that we are Overcomers because you overcame on our behalf and we'll give you the praise and the honor and the glory for it's in the name above every name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that we pray and the Saints said you may be seated if you won't go to sleep in the Amplified version of of Proverbs 4:23 it says it like this keep and guard your heart with all vigilance and above all that you guard you're going to guard a lot of gates and things in your life but the most important one that you're going to guard and protect is your heart because what settles in your heart your life flows out of that if you let bitterness settle in your heart how many of you know bitterness is going to flow out it's going to flow out in your thought life it's going to flow out in your word life it's coming out of you if you let jealousy settle in there then your every filter everything that happens to you every reaction is going to be filtered through whatever is settled down into your heart jealousy so Nathan prayed the most appropriate prayer today and that is that God would heal up every wound he actually said cariz every wound to keep the infection out to to keep the uh to keep whatever it is out that would like to cause you to be destroyed the enemy can't change who you are as a son of God but he can change your fellowship with God and he can affect your fellowship with one another if you will stay in fellowship with God if you'll do what sister said and you when you don't understand if you just lay your head on the chest of his sovereignty and know that God is more than able to do exceeding and abundantly above everything that we would even ask or even above our imagination because that's who he is while you are guarding your life make sure that you're paying particular attention to your to your heart it goes on to say for out of it flow the Springs of of life you know the world tells us that we are a product of what we have been through I know that a lot of people don't understand the concept but so many times too many times it's the truth because we allow things to Lodge there instead of letting them pass through let me tell you whatever you're walking through today it didn't come to stay it came to pass now you got to let it go look at your neighbor and say you better let something go there's some things you want to hold on to and there's some things that you just want to let go come on brother or sister you want to let some things go they matter now but they won't matter in eternity so what about we just make up our mind I'm not going to let it hinder me now I'm not going into battle with flipflops on I'm going to make sure my feet are shot with the preparation of peace I'm going to take the sword of the spirit you don't have to be a preacher to use the word of God against the enemy me just be a believer just believe it and use it as a weapon against him take that Shield of faith and use it to quench the fiery darts of the enemy and if you can't if you can't uh catch it with your Shield thank God you wear the breastplate of his of his righteousness let me read Ephesians 6:14 in the Amplified I hope I don't offend you by doing so if I do it'll pass quickly stand therefore hold your ground I I I haven't yet defined the verse when I was a child I heard an old preacher preaching up a storm and he said the Bible said if you give the devil an inch he'll take a mile well I didn't find that in the Bible but I tell you what I did find the scripture said don't give space don't give any space to the enemy because if you surrender a part of your heart to that which is negative dark or evil the enemy will never be satisfied with that little place you give him he will always desire to expand until he controls the issues of your life because what lodges in the heart determines the issues of Life did you know you can find healing in your body sometime by just being healed in your heart I don't know if you understand or not but God doesn't just want to heal your flesh he wants to heal us from the inside out he's not just redeeming part of who we are but he has Redemption for every part of of who we are if you believe that you can say Amen having tightened the belt of Truth this is a good hour to do that in because there's all kinds of Lies there's all kinds of rumors there's all kinds of Winds of Doctrine if there's ever been a time to tighten up the belt of Truth to know what you believe to believe it with all your heart to make up your mind that if it's rooted and grounded in the word you're not going to give up you're not backing up come on you're not looking to the right or the left but you're going forward through Jesus Christ who gives you strength he goes on to say tightening the belt of Truth around your loins and having put on the breastplate of Integrity now that's what righteousness can do for you the righteousness of God can cultivate Integrity in your life the world is finished with hypocrite Christians your neighbors don't want to hear your talk if they hear you screaming at your wife in the yard they don't want to hear your church talk if you're not walking the walk if there's ever an hour that the bride has got to stand up and live what we know this is that hour if you think your righteousness is getting you anywhere you need to give up on that right now and remember it is his righteousness working in you that causes you to tell the truth it causes you to be a man of your word it causes you to be a woman of your word not fudging not living in the gray not trying to find a white lie to replace a black one A Lie Is A Lie Is A Lie is a lie God's looking for a people that will live by this word and he's found one in his bride are you in that number I trust you are having put on the breastplate of Integrity of his righteousness and of moral rectitude and right standing with God that's because of him you can't live clean enough you can't live holy enough to get there it's only because of him if you believe that you ought to squeeze out a little amen here you're going to make me work for every amen today aren't you I can tell but I'm used to you so I'm going to move on the Greek says put on the complete Armor of God did you know if you move the preposition and looked at it a little closer in the Greek it literally would be possessive it literally would be possessive in the sense that it would be his armor now when we read it we read the armor of God meaning you know these are Godly principles faith and and righteousness and peace but that's really not what it's saying if you looked a little closer at the way the Greek is worded and the preposition in the different place you'd understand that it's actually calling it possessive it's saying God's armor the one that he has the one that he has created the one that he has made for you and I to borrow it's for us if we want it how many of you want it I'm going to war you look folks you're going to war whether you want to or not hell is going to March against you the devil's going to howl against you he's going to breathe accusations down your neck he's going to sell you half truths if he can spiritual war Warfare is not optional it's part of the Christian life but we have everything we need to defeat the enemy anytime anywhere no matter what the circumstances are we are well equipped by taking God's armor his armor the Puritan preachers of yester year uh Paul bunan and so many others they they really like to emphasize the fact that when God was giving us this armor that there was nothing to to protect the back how many of you have ever heard that uh read it and Pilgrim's Progress it talks about the fact that the breastplate is on the front and the shield is used to protect the front and there's nothing for the back but that's not really the reality of this armor that God has prepared it makes a beautiful sermon it it it it sounds really interesting because we like to say well that means you can't Retreat you can't ever turn your back on the enemy but I'd like for you to know that the enemy is Sly and he doesn't always come front on you know he'll use somebody you love he'll sneak around behind you sometime and you've got to not only be prepared to meet him face on but you've got to have something behind you protect ing you when the enemy comes in Sly like a fox has anybody ever dealt with that devil so if you do a little more research about this armor especially the breastplate I want to read the description to you if you don't mind early in the first century ad during the life of Our Lord second temple period the Roman army began to adapt and change its armor we aren't sure what the Romans called their new kind of body armor the one that they started using especially in their control of Jerusalem but historians call it lorica which means uh an armor with segments or with pieces an armor made of of different segments or pieces the the new armor that would have been describe the armor uh that we are looking at in Ephesians 6 was an armor that was sort of a system of 40 different segments of metal plates so if you can possibly picture this I I have a little hard time doing it there was a series of 2 to three inch thin metal plates that started at The Soldier's belt and were woven all around the body like like a piece of of of pieace mail or metal then the next piece or segment of metal and then the next piece or segment of metal would be placed side by side or up and down coming down this way uh and then where one piece left off the next piece would begin it would go all the way up from his waist to just under his arms covering his entire torso what was the benefit of that that's where all the vital organs are correct these pieces of metal plate were overlapped sometimes like roofing shingles one overlapping the other and there was no way to get in between them to pierce into them there was another series of metal strips that started at the upper arm and the strips would cross the shoulders went down past the neck the same thing on the other side from the upper arm over to the neck across the chest over the back all the way down to the hips these strips of thin metal covered the entire upper body so not just the front but also the back listen God's got it all covered under this body armor but over the wool tunic that the soldiers wear they would also have a leather vest usually to sort of protect them from getting gouged by the metal because even the armor itself was almost dangerous if a soldier was moving about so to prevent the armor from resting or from uh affecting the skin then there would be a leather vest underneath picture something like a modern football shoulder pad not quite as bulky not quite as extend end in far from the shoulders or from the body but covering the same basic parts of the shoulders and then another piece woven with it covering the belly the back and the sides then the breastplate once he put on a leather shirt the breastplate was put over him all of that armor was put over him fastened together the bottom of the breastplate was anchored guess where to the belt why so that in the middle of swinging his sword the breastplate didn't begin to ride up on his body making him unable to engage in battle so all of these pieces of metal coming down making this overlapping shingle effect and then tied off at the belt so that it wouldn't ride up I want you to know somebody was an engineering genius and this is the kind of armor that's being described it's the kind of armor that Paul would have been most familiar with having lived in the second temple period I like the fact that the breastplate is tied to the belt because the belt represents what truth the breastplate represents what his righteousness in Isaiah 58 and 8 if you look at that the word of God tells us that our back is not unguarded he said then shall thy light Break Forth as the morning and thine Health shall spring forth speedily and thy righteousness shall go before Thee the glory of the Lord shall be thy rear word you know he goes before us preparing the way his light is like a lamp to our feet as we heard in the song and now the scripture said the glory of the Lord comes to cover us from the back so if we take on the complete Armor of God we are well protected against the Ws of the enemy but did you notice the scripture said you've got to take it you've got to put it on there's nobody who can dress you in that complete armor your preacher can't do it your mama can't do it granny can't do it you have to be willing to take it to accept it by faith and to put it on in your life that Hebrew word uh rearward there literally means to gather or collect from the rear to bring up the rear or to guard from the rear so in the New Testament we've got the complete armor of the Lord and the Old Testament tells us that the glory of the Lord is going to come behind us and protect us from behind I like that uh of course the word Glory that's used there the glory of the Lord shall be your rear word that is that word cavod in Hebrew and remember it doesn't just mean a little bit of his presence or just a little bit of a feeling or some inspiration or sensation it actually means the heav that heavy weighty costly Splendor of his presence someone said to me a few months ago brother if we have the word why do we need his presence because the Bible tells us that the letter kth you know you can quote all the scriptures to the devil you want to but he he sees how you live the rest of the time you can't fudge on that it's the word that has been quickened to us Made Alive to us the word that we use to defeat the enemy today is not a Written Letter it's a Living Word how many of you are glad the Living Word is on board Jesus the living reality of who he is in the life of the believer and yes right now having heard the message with the seals open and all of the Glorious things that God has done for us in this hour we still need encounters with that heavy weighty costly Splendor of his presence somebody said he meets me in my car he will he meets me at the foot of my bed he will but he also wants to meet you when you come to his house he wants to meet you here if if you're sitting on your hands instead of entering in to Worship the Lord when you have an opportunity to do so you may miss the hour of your visitation from the cavod I want to walk in such a way that I'm in tune with that with that presence because I'm telling you I need that that Glory that presence I is something that's More Than A Feeling and it's more than an emotion it stirs up a spiritual hunger in the heart of the believer it transforms and changes us from where we are into the stature of the perfect man Jesus Christ and how did the scripture say that happens from Glory it didn't say from verse to verse better hear me it it didn't say from quote to quote we're transformed from glory to glory from Splendor of his presence the Splendor of his presence the word is already working activated in our life and when we come into the presence that word becomes living and moving someone said we don't live by feeling that's exactly right and yet the scripture said you'll know you're saved because there's a coming alive there's a quickening that's not a sensation or a goosebump that's a moving on the inside it's like an internal earthquake has anybody ever experienced something like that look at 2 Corinthians CH 3: 18 with me for just a moment and all of us as with unveiled face because we continue to behold in the word of God as in a mirror the glory of the Lord watch this are constantly being it's a process it has an in on the end of it we are constantly being transfigured changed into his very own image in EV listen this is good in ever increasing Splendor and from and from one degree of Glory to to another it's not enough to say I encountered him 30 years ago did you encounter him this morning he was here he came to meet you here today he came to meet you in worship he came to meet you in the special singing he came to meet you in every part of what we're doing here today so don't let what you experience yester year be all that you need don't let it's not not all you need don't let it be your only satisfaction we need one degree of Glory from another we need to come into His anointing every day of our life we need to encounter the Splendor of his presence as often as we possibly can and he is as close as the mention of his name do you believe that in Isaiah 588 it says the same as what we just read but I want to read it again in in the Amplified it said then shall your light Break Forth this is the only other place in the Old Testament where rearward is mentioned then shall your light Break Forth like the morning and your healing your restoration and the power of a new life shall spring forth speedily your righteousness your rightness your Justice and your right relationship with God see again it's really the outworking of his righteousness that's what makes you right is because you've got a hold of the one who is Right shall go before you conducting you to peace and prosperity and the glory of the Lord shall be your rear guard and the glory of the Lord in 52:12 Isaiah for he shall not go out with haste ye shall not go out with haste nor go by flight for the Lord listen the Lord will go before you and the god of Israel will be your your rear guard the glory will come behind you you see it's the breastplate of his righteousness is what gives us Grace to be able to guard our heart because if those fiery darts of the enemy can find a lodging place in your emotion in the church age book it says this Ephesians chapter the the chapter on the Ephesian Church age book the True Church of Jesus Christ the bride is likened to pure gold here's the key her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attributes we're growing up into the stature not of just a perfect man but into the stature of the perfect man the one who was both God and man the fullness of the godhead dwelt in him by is that what the scripture said so his righteousness hers is his her attributes are his her identity is found she's lost her name she's not wearing a hyphenated name she turned loose of her name and she now wears his glorious name that's why she was baptized in his name that's why she didn't settle for titles that's why she said I want to be his I want to bear his name I want to bear his righteousness I want to bear his attributes come on what he has what he has she is to reflect she's not reflecting Church anity Creeds and dogmas of Rome no no no she's here to reflect character what he has she is to manifest she is to manifest let's go on there is no fault now what do you want to say about that you you you're amening that we're here to bear his attributes we are here to bear his character then don't get quiet when he said there is no fault in her and the reason for that is she's being transformed right amen and and when when he became sin he paid the price not just your past he paid for your present and he paid for your future is that right there is no fault in her she is all glorious within and without that's because she's reflecting him from beginning to ending she is the work of her Lord and all his works are perfect in fact in her is summed up and manifested the Eternal wisdom and purpose of God oh Lord let us live today to manifest the Eternal wisdom and purpose of the great Creator how can one fathom it how can one understand it though we cannot do it it we can accept it even if you can't explain it you can see that it is according to the word so how do we access the truth of the word by faith it's mine I am come on I am I am healed let the weak say I can hardly make it I don't ask people anymore how was your week because even Believers don't know how to talk they say it was a week from hell how is that possible how is it possible for a Believer to receive a week from hell you may have battled but so did every believer come on what you did is you just lived a week right out of your destiny book it's there there to shape you it's there to mold you to God be the glory so I just had a Heavenly week it was rough there was some things that weren't pleasant we can say we had some stuff to get over there were some hurdles to jump but we're so thankful that God is still God honey that's how Believers have got to talk he's bringing me through Jesus is my victory yeah come on it changes everything because what's in the heart if you feel sorry for yourself it'll get lodged up in there and your life will start manifesting that need for sympathy let me tell you something sympathy may be a blessing at times but it's not what we need to get over sympathy doesn't get us even empathy doesn't get us over the only thing that gives us Overcomers Victory Is by a testimony because we overcome by the blood of the Lamb number one and number two by the word of what comes out of our mouth that's why a heart has to be so entirely guarded in Isaiah 59 just a little while longer with me if you will Isaiah 59:1 16 and he saw that there was was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor therefore his arm brought salvation Yeshua unto him and his righteousness it sustained him this is a Messianic prophecy right out of the inspiration of God through the writing of the prophet Isaiah for he put on righteousness as a breastplate and an helmet of the very name the very name of Jesus Yeshua his Hebrew name uh the helmet of of Jesus the helmet of salvation upon his head and he put on the garments of Vengeance for clothing this is the Messiah and was clad with a Zeal as a cloak so if this is the metaphorical language used by the prophet to describe the presentation of the coming Messiah then isn't it right for Paul to say it was his armor what you're putting on is not Romans armor it's not an armor that just belonged to a Roman soldier it's the armor of the lord lord today I'm putting on your armor I'm putting on the helmet of Yeshua the helmet of salvation I'm going to put on the breastplate of righteousness I'm going to prepare my feet with peace yes I'm going to take the sword of the spirit I'm going to guard my own heart my own garden because the enemy is always creeping around Desiring to seow his seeds of discrepancy you believe that and I like What He Wore as a cloak Zeal now remember that word zeal in the Hebrew is Passion it it's passion if you're going to do something something for God it's not anymore praise the Lord anyhow we sung that in the old church you know praise the Lord anyhow makes no difference what comes my way I'm GNA praise the Lord anyhow that doesn't sound like overcoming to me sounds kind of nice but it doesn't sound like an overcomer you see I'm not going to praise the Lord anyhow and give him any old praise Just Praise because I think I'm I want to give him what the scripture calls High that's Warfare praise that's actually what the word tells us it's Warfare praise it's praise that pushes back the shadow Jason sometime when you're working on a car and the enemy may come in your mind that he might make you heavy you've got a way you've got a way provided for you to push that Darkness back you don't have to get religious you don't have to get churchy all you have to do is just pray just Just Praise Him not anyhow because you want to because you're fearfully and wonderfully created to praise him it's who we are it's not what we do it's an expression of who we are here come the Lord as the Messiah with a cloak of passion with a cloak of zeal if we're going to do something for god let's do it with everything that that's within us I told you how my I'm of course I'm thinking about sister Bell so I I'll think about my granny she would play the guitar for me to sing when I was a boy she played the Gibson guitar and uh she always wanted to stand over here if I stood there she wanted to stand here and if I ever got on the wrong side of her she'd make me move before I sang how many of you remember why because if I wasn't given it enough she'd used the neck of that guitar to bump me pretty hard on the back of the head in church in Church I'm in the middle of a song and Granny's guitar neck would hit me in the back of the head and I'd look at her like I didn't know what it was about but I did I'd look at her and she said you going to give him praise give him everything don't sit up there and sing where nobody can hear you somebody said you sure are loud when you preaching saying it's Granny's fault cuz she said if you're going to do it you got to do it with a Zeal you got to do it with a passion you got to do it with all your heart let everything that has praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord amen I thank God he said it goes on according to their deeds accordingly he will repay Fury to his adversaries recompense to his enemies to the islands he will pay recompense I wanted to stop in this but but I had to put some more verses here because it gets really good as you read so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory before the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up you know we have so many critics they they even criticize because we have meals during camp meeting after the service you know people have so much to say about these poor sisters who have to to make a meal for these visitors who come in we we we get criticized because you may look around sometime and see sister Megan or sister J or somebody raising a little flag or waving a little something to the Lord and they say well you know brother brandom didn't do that in the Tabernacle you're not in the Tabernacle that's right you're in a sovereign church every church is Sovereign you're not going to come in here and tell me how to praise the Lord I'm going to praise Him according to the dictates of my heart I'm going to take a junior Jackson pass on that because he said I know that's how they do it at the Tabernacle but he said I want to do a little different over here and brother bam said leave them alone folks ought to just leave you alone when you want to praise him why did you bring up that because what do you think a standard is it's a war flag and when the enemy sees that standard and of course we can go a lot of places with that stand we can talk about Holiness cuz we need a little more of that in the body I see brothers that need to visit the barber shop a little more often and and and sisters who could use a little little length in their skirt and we can talk about that that's also a standard don't get quiet it's still the truth but the standard here is not talking about a Holiness standard it's talking about a war flag when the enemy wo comes in like a flood the Lord will lift up a war flag against him somebody said what if I don't have a war flag you do I would that men everywhere would lift up holy hands without wrath and without doubt somebody said I don't understand why you know I just like to do that do that if that's all you can do do it some people are stove up and that's the best they can get but I want you to know when I come to praise him I want to praise him I want to do my if I can get it up there as long as I can get it up I may not be able to reach very far behind me but if I can get it up I want to get it up because sometimes that's my war flag and when the enemy sees a Believer going going through the fire going through a trial going through joint pain going through whatever sickness you're dealing with and yet you've got your war flag up and you're saying my God is good he's good he's faithful he's going to always take care of me it it causes the enemy to pull back he's the one that's destined to retreat you're not to be intimidated you're to push him back and you can do that with a war flag you can do that with a standard well didn't it say The Spirit of the Lord shall do it it didn't say you'd do it it'd say the spirit of the Lord should do it what do you think brought me here this morning why do you think I'm here I'm here by the grace of God I'm here because the spirit of the Lord strengthened me to get here he gave me the want to he gave me the desire when I got up this morning I got up to praise him I didn't wait till I got here to give him glory I gave him glory before I rolled out of bed at 6:45 I gave him glory when I started going toward the shower when I come out I was still thanking God for what he was going to do for us if we get in that atmosphere now of course you understand that uh there's lots of commas in English but there were none in Hebrew there were there were some breath breath marks to help people know when to take a breath but there weren't really Commons so this translation could really go either way this is right out of King James it says when the enemy shall come in like a flood and somebody somewhere said this this is going into English this is a good place to put the comma so people can get a breath while they're reading because that's all it was in Hebrew a breath Mark but in English it sometimes separates the meaning of a subject and when a comma comes it can change a comma oh my goodness you you've seen that little meme that that talks about if you put the Comm in the wrong place you're eating Grandma instead of eating what grandma made so you got to be careful with that comma well this could really literally read either way and I I read it both ways it's good both ways some people only read it when the enemy comes in like a flood comma the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him and that's all that's right that's English it's fairly translated it's okay to do that but it could just as equally read I'm I'm going I'm back to the it could just equally read when the enemy shall come in yes sir come on lack a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him now the reality is the enemy will come in like a flood but the greater reality is when he does so will the Lord if you don't believe that then you miss the scripture that says the Lord sth on top of the flood he rides it like a horse to come to your rescue when you call on him you may feel forsaken you may feel forgotten you may feel rejected you may feel overlooked but it's a lie your God hasn't misplaced you he knows exactly where you are get your war flag up Let Your Standard be raised against the enemy and he has no choice but to do what he has to flee from you okay I'll leave the translation alone but it sure makes a difference I've seen the enemy come in like a flood but I've also watched the Lord I've watched him ride in woo seemingly out of nowhere and suddenly change everything woo I'm thankful I'm so thankful for every time now we know that the uh I'm not going to finish reading all all of this uh but I will I will read verse 21 as for me this is my Covenant with them saith the Lord that's him he signed this my spirit that is upon thee and my words which I have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed saith the Lord from henceforth and forever I I don't think you ought to miss that it's a promise with a covenant attached and it says if you'll hold on to me I'm going to hold on to you I'm going to put some victory in your talk cuz you need some victory in your talk so that you can get it moved down to your walk and I'm not only going to do it for you but I'm going to do it for your seed your children and I'm going to do it for your children's children anybody want to believe God for the Deliverance of their family anybody want to sing A Chorus of it's already done my family is sealed It's Already Done claiming every one of them now that breastplate of righteousness is a metaphor for the protection of the heart which is the seed of the emotions and affection there's a lot of things can live in that Garden did you know love can live there but so can lust you want to cultivate the love you want to dig out the lust it won't leave on its own it'll never leave on its own it's connected even to the chemistry of your body it won't leave on it own you'll have to cut it out by the root you'll have to dig it out with a grub hole come on you'll have to take God's word to it until you have utterly destroyed its ability to flourish in your life God gives us the grace to do that so we're watching carefully over our heart that breastplate of righteousness protects the core of a person's spiritual life it is a supernatural armor that Ena Christians to stand against the devil's schemes and to fight against the forces of Darkness that spiritually invade your body your mind as a Believer a battle involves two Waring armies or personas or factions engaged in a struggle a controversy or a contest similarly as Christians we're faced with daily spiritual warfare this this means our enemy is known in the Physical Realm but instead of actively attacking in the Physical Realm he often Works through the spiritual realm breaking forth into the physical therefore we can't always see him he's like the wind we can't always see him but we can see the effect of where he's been where he's moving God gives us the ability to do that and that might sound scary to some believers who don't even believe that there is still a Warfare going on it may leave you wondering if there's a way out of this but I want you to know everything you need to whip the devil everything you need to defeat the enemy is in Your Arsenal yes if you won't leave it there untouched in the message the greatest battle ever fought and we're winding down paragraph 400 it says see his attack watch listen close this closing his attack is what disbelief God's word that's why he comes he he he doesn't come just to take your joy he comes to cause you not to believe that God is always good I want everybody to know we said this last week but I want everybody to know God is always good he's always good when things happen that aren't good God is still always always good you've got to remember that because that's how the enemy moved in against Eve he convinced her that God did not have her total good in his heart that he was holding something back for himself and therefore was looking at his creation uh in in in a different kind of light and and that he would be exalted and and that mankind would continually be put down but how many of you know that's just a dirty lie he came to raise them up that's right he came to raise Adam and Eve up he came to raise this generation up into his presence not put them down but if God can get you to doubt that he is if the enemy rather can get you to doubt that God is good he's already got a foot in the door you're already in trouble brother Brandon goes on to say there can you see the the greatest battle was ever fought there's only two forces Satan and God and what is Satan's weapon against you it is watch this carefully you know this it is to try to get you to disbelieve your weapon what is Satan's greatest weapon against you to try to get you to disbelieve your weapon and your weapon is God's word and if he can do that he disarms you he said if he can get you to disbelief your weapon is equivalent if he gets you to believe that your weapon is not strong enough he has disarmed you 402 look he's disarmed you when he gets you to disbelieve the weapon when you lay that down the word when you lay that down that finishes your fight you're done if you lay down the sword of the spirit the word of God you've lost that battle it's all you have it is written and it wasn't the letter only that Jesus used to overcome oh no it was the Living Word declaring the word and that's what God wants to be in you he wants to fill you with who he is the Living Word so that when you take up that written record of his word and you speak it to your enemy to your Mountain to your circumstance to your situation it's not just a d sentence now because the Living Word is inspiring it it's alive the enemy has no choice he can play around with your written quote or your written verse he can he can talk to you over that and try to get you to well that don't apply to you that's all right but it don't apply to you but you put that written word the written record of his word the Bible that absolute you put that in the hands of someone who's filled with the Living Word you see this isn't the third part of the Trinity that's living inside of you this Holy Ghost is much more than that that's the same God that Holy Ghost in you is the same God that said let there be light and there was light you see he didn't need to exercise so much power because he was Authority and while the church constantly prays for more power it's not more power that we need it's more Authority we need to recognize the authority that is already ours because when you wake up to your potential Authority and you start using the power of that word with the authority of of the one who spoke it it is written thus says the word he has no choice but to respond to that because that's not the third piece of God that's who God is he didn't want to just be Emmanuel God With Us he wanted to be holy ghost he wanted to be God in us same Jesus this same name Jesus that you see leaving he's coming again and he is one of these days to receive his bride but how many of you know he came on the day of Pentecost this is that in fact Jesus tried to tell them he tried to tell them all about it if they could have only had ears to hear aren't you glad that God has given you some some ears to hear and some I have and you know who this is living inside of you the Living Word lives in The Believer if he can get you to disbelieve your weapon he disarms you he goes on when you lay that down that finishes your fight you're done hold that weapon don't lay it down you've got to hold on to that and then in the message Junction of time this one made me jump I jumped when I read it and now notice again that not only that when all hell turns loose when the enemy comes in like a flood like a flood the spirit of the Lord will raise up a standard hear what he said when all hell turns loose all Heaven turns loose also so which are you going to testify about I'm going to testify that all of Heaven is turning loose on my behalf we already know the devil's after us we need to be reminded that God is already loosing what we need he said when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God raises up a standard against it and these two forces always showed they always manifested at the junction right did you all understand that we we've come to the to the last Junction it's bride time it's time for this little body of manifested sons to get up and do what God has called us to do and there's a lot that got to happen in us for that to happen and the first thing we got to quit making so many excuses we've got to quit talking about all hell turning and loose against us and we've got to start focusing a little more on the fact that every everything we need to make this Rapture has already been released in us not to US in US it is here and we've got to put our Focus there while guarding our heart against all other unbelief if you believe that maybe you'd say amen amen and here is one verse in closing 1 Peter 5 8 and N I'm sorry again it's in the it's in the louder version be well balanced uhoh brother brandom said to brother green brother Perry whatever you [Music] do keep your balance in the scriptures there has to be an absolute Foundation all Doctrine all Visions all dreams all spiritual gifts even feelings everything has to come and set down on the on the foundation of scripture the absolute of scripture if it doesn't line up I don't care how good it felt if it doesn't line up with the word you've got to reject it we've got to be balanced in our Doctrine we've got to be balanced in our emotion we can't let our emotions lead us we've got to have authority over them your mind will try to lead you your will will try to lead you away from the plan of God for your life your emotions will try to lead you away from the absolutes of scripture but if you'll be well-balanced temperate sober of mind God doesn't mind you having a sense having a sense of humor but there's just some things you don't clown around with this is a pretty serious hour we're in it's all right to enjoy life it's all right to say something funny I hope because without humor life can get pretty dry in don't you feel sorry for people that look sour every time you see them maybe some people got more than you've got but they're still sour that's not how the believer is going to get through this thing a merry heart doeth good like a medicine if you let your spirit always be if you let your spirit always be broken it affects your health it dries your bones the scripture said it makes you brittle against the obstacles of life okay be vigilant temperate sober of Mind Vigilant cautious at all times for that enemy of yours the Devil roams around like a lion roaring in Fierce hunger he doesn't want to just roar against you he wants to devour you seeking someone to seize upon and devour somebody said oh that makes me afraid read on withstand him you don't run from the Roar you run toward the Roar the word said withstand him be firm in faith against his onset rooted established strong immovable and determined remember the old hymn I shall not be moved some people have taken that religiously and they think that it kind of means like we have to do church today like it was done in another generation I want you to know that Fanny Crosby wasn't the last anointed psalmist I love her songs I sing them in my life I love the old hymns I grew up on the old hymns but sometimes people think that we're paying homage by by conducting everything that we do like it was done then and I want you to know that sometimes even our Traditions can make the word of God ineffective in our life and I think you know me enough to know what my balance is in that I believe in separate living I believe men ought to look like men dress like men behave like men and women ought to dress like women like ladies come on I'm not talking about those Traditions I'm talking about being so stuck that we think the church ought to smell as musty today as it did then that's not the way this works this truth didn't stop truth is moving marching forward bringing us with it it's not a new message I'm talking about it's a new application it's a generation that says I'm not just going to quote it I'm going to be it I'm going to let it change me I'm not just going to say brother brandom said my pastor said brother green said but I'm going to come to a place where I so living and so alive in me that I take take the same Authority you foul Spirit move out in the name of Jesus Christ and how many of you know the devil has to go he absolutely has to go withstand him be firm in faith against his onset musicians coming rooted established strong immovable and determined knowing that the same identical sufferings are appointed to your Brotherhood the whole body of Christians throughout the world can I paraphrase that for you you ain't the only one going through something honey if we took a poll if we had a vote how many of you going through something everybody in here is going through something but but the relative term in all of that is you're going through it you're not trying to get around it you're not trying to dig under it you're not even always trying to climb over it you realize that sometimes the only Victory you have is to push your way right through by the blood of the lamb and the word of God's God's word in your mouth in your life in in the message law uh or Grace he said 'I tell you it ought to make every Christian buckle up the armor that's paragraph 61 it ought to make every Christian when you see what folks are going through when you see what you're going through in your own life it ought to make every one of us want to take on that armor every day Buckle it on he said over there it said put on the full armor of God and be sure to bring the breastplate and the helmet and the shield and all those things Paul likened it to a Soldier go into battle and when the Wilds of the enemy come in and they have and they will and when the Wilds of the enemy comes in throw up your Shield don't turn and run don't tuck tail and see who you can hide behind throw up your Shield go on out and meet the challeng how can you do that because you've got the armor you've got everything you need one more Redemption by power paragraph 80 and every man that's born of the spirit of God comes into Christ has everlasting life you've got more than everlasting life you've got Zoe life which is not everlasting life it is eternal life did you know if we carefully look at the word Everlasting in the Bible we find that it's not necessarily Eternal but you don't just have life Everlasting you've got the fullest degree of Life the one that is eternal the Zoey life of God and when you come into that you put on his shield his his breastplate standing ready and forbidden to leave until orders to March now you can say that's the soldiers armor or you can say what Paul said put on take on the armor of God the one that he wore as Messiah when he came and in that you'll be able to stand against every while of the enemy let's stand father give us Grace today as Nathan prayed to search through our hearts with you to let you find the spots that need the most attention if there's a root of bitterness growing show us because we don't want bitterness to be something flowing out as an issue from our life if Envy has began to grow show us Lord how to take the root how to take it at the root so that it can never spring forth again if I am spending my life comparing my life my existence to somebody else's envy and jealousy is bound to grow show me Lord how to get it out and then to see a guard set over my heart that it would never grow again love through us Jesus there are those who are easy to love and there are those who strain us but your love is so powerful and so transformative that we don't want to just love with the fileo love we want to love with Agape we want agapo love to be our theme we want it to move through us and shine out of us for the glory of God would you just lift your hand to him right where you are and and say Lord this is my desire I want to put on the armor of God I want to stand Faithfully against the Ws of the devil I want to be on the Watchtower of my own heart the seat of my emotions I don't want anything growing there that is unlike you so we Just Surrender our hands are lifted not in some formality but as a sign of surrender to say Lord come and do for us El Shai come and do for us what we cannot do for ourselves and we'll give you glory and honor and praise it's due your name it belongs to you we yield Our Lives to you

search this house to minister as only you can to the need if you have a need and you'd acknowledge it just by lifting your hand right now Lord It's not the hand you're looking for it's the heart

asking you to come as only you can and give us the garments of praise for the spirit of heaviness we resist heaviness in The Believer right now in the name of Jesus we push that heaviness back and we say you are not of God we will not settle for the heaviness of a burden when you have come in the heaviness and weightiness of your glory yes we don't want to be weighted down with worry if we choose to be weighted it's by your presence it's by Your glory come and arrest us for this hour woo let the Lord just touch you as an individual I don't care if you if you make any noise I don't care it's
