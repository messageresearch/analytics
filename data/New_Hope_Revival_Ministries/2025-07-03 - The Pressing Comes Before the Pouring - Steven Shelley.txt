Description:
There’s a journey from the vineyard to the King’s cup.  The grape doesn’t become wine without crushing, and neither do we become vessels of honor without the pressing. God is stripping away the tough skin—everything that’s hardened us—so the real life inside can be poured out for His purpose. Just like Jesus was crushed in Gethsemane, we’re being shaped through pressure, pain, and surrender. But it’s not for nothing. He’s making something valuable. Something fit for the hand of the King. You’re not forgotten—you’re being prepared. And when the time is right, you’ll be poured out as a gift for His glory.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
We're talking about the journey from the from the vineyard to the chalice of the king, the king's cup. There is a process to get the grape all the way through so that it ends up emptied, skin left behind. How many of you want to leave your old tough hide, tough skin, bad stuff? You you have hardened because of the circumstances of your life. And that hard skin keeps you from being pliable and moldable in the service of the Lord. So he wants you to leave that junk behind. And only the juice, that's the good part of who you are, goes on to the next step, the next step. And one day bless God in the new kingdom. You become and even now we become the a gift in his hand. We become a vessel in his hand. We become the wine that he drinks. Grapes are harvested in season. Never too early, never too late. You as a grape, you as fruit in his vintage must be harvested in season. You come in in the right hour, in the right moment when he calls you is perfect timing. If they're too early, they're bitter or sour. If they're too late, they've already started to rot or mold. Harvesting was often by hand because it is such a serious and careful affair with careful intention. Uh every believer also has a divine appointment in the timing. The truth reaches you in a moment that you are ready to receive it. And I want to tell you something. He became our example in the crushing. How do you know I have to be crushed? Because he was. Isaiah 53:5. But he was wounded for our transgressions. He was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon him. And with his thrift, we are healed. Oh, our example went before us. There is no glory without pressing. The press is painful, but it's where the wine begins. Hallelujah. Wine doesn't begin in the fermentation. It begins in the crushing. The press equals pressure, trials, betrayal, grief, loss, misunderstanding. The outer skin has to be broken of the breaking of that outer part of the soul life to release an inner character from the spirit. his spirit that has taken possession of a fallen human spirit and he has regenerated that spirit with his own life. It's not without you. It's within you. It has to be released. So there is a breaking of the outer part so that the sweetness and the reality of the inner part can come forth. Oh God, I thank you for it. Even Jesus pressed in Gethsemane, which the very word Gethsemane means olive press. So it shouldn't be a mystery to us that even our Lord struggled in the press in Gethsemane when he cried, "My spirit is willing. My flesh is weak." And he could have easily said, "My soul is hung in the middle." Because that's the reality. God knew what he was doing. He didn't curse you with mind, will, and emotions. He gifted you with mind, will, and emotion so that you could learn how to surrender mind, will, and emotions to his will.
