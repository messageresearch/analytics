[0:00] I
[0:00] [Music]
[0:46] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen
[0:49] Shelley and I want to welcome you to the
[0:51] Eagles cry I just pray that the Lord
[0:54] will speak to you today from his word as
[0:57] we study together the wonderful words of
[1:00] life I am so thankful to God that He has
[1:03] given us the record of his word the Holy
[1:06] Bible and its life it's absolutely life
[1:10] to me and I find myself some time
[1:14] thinking of how I can reorder my day so
[1:18] that I can spend more time in God's Word
[1:21] if God's word has not become a living
[1:23] book to you yet it can perhaps the enemy
[1:27] is blocking your mind and it seems like
[1:29] it's just a dead letter to you then I
[1:32] just pray that the Lord will release and
[1:35] impart to you a hunger a spiritual
[1:38] hunger because the truth in God's Word
[1:42] can be like a dead letter unless the
[1:46] Spirit comes to make his word alive in
[1:50] you and I just asked him I just feel
[1:52] right now just to say Lord let your
[1:54] spirit quicken your word to those who
[1:58] have a desire to study and to know your
[2:01] word but feel blocked in their minds I
[2:04] just break off right now in the name of
[2:06] Jesus those heavy bands of oppression
[2:10] against your mind that would keep you
[2:13] from receiving the truth of God's Word
[2:15] and I just say Lord let there be a flow
[2:17] over you right now of his spirit a river
[2:20] of his spirit making a clear channel for
[2:24] you to receive revelation knowledge this
[2:27] is an hour of great revelation knowledge
[2:30] based on God's Word and I want you to be
[2:32] a part of it please contact our ministry
[2:35] if you will the information will be
[2:37] given to you on the screen how you can
[2:39] get in contact with us send us your
[2:41] prayer requests let us know where you're
[2:43] watching the eagles cry and it'll be a
[2:45] great blessing to us we we certainly
[2:48] enjoy hearing from you and knowing that
[2:52] we've been able to sew into your life in
[2:54] a positive way that's why we're here
[2:56] we're not here to promote ourselves our
[2:59] church or our ministry we're here
[3:02] representing the kingdom of God we're
[3:04] here representing the Lord Jesus Christ
[3:06] and we want to we want to represent him
[3:09] well we want to represent him in truth I
[3:12] believe that's very important and I know
[3:14] that many of you do and that's why you
[3:15] are so faithful to tuning in week after
[3:18] week you either see this on the
[3:20] television or you stream it on the
[3:23] Internet some of you watch these
[3:24] programs by podcasts some of you
[3:27] purchase the dvds and that's how you see
[3:30] the Eagles cry however you're watching I
[3:33] pray that you'll be blessed today let's
[3:35] look right to God's Word shall we I want
[3:39] to read today from Hebrews chapter 5
[3:43] verse 8 and 9 we're doing a study
[3:47] together on exercising the senses of our
[3:53] spirit and I just wish that I had time
[3:57] this is the fourth program in the series
[4:00] and I wished I had time to just go back
[4:02] and cover it all again because i think
[4:05] the foundation of where we're going is
[4:07] is a good foundation and i think what we
[4:11] shared today would mean a whole lot more
[4:12] to you if you could hear the other parts
[4:15] and so if you are interested you could
[4:18] contact our ministry it's not expensive
[4:21] to get the DVD set that will be made
[4:24] available and you could watch the whole
[4:26] thing and I don't normally say things
[4:29] like that i mean people know me and they
[4:31] know that i don't normally do that but i
[4:33] really do believe for in my heart that
[4:36] there are some truths that God is
[4:38] showing us in his word that are going to
[4:40] bring transformation in your life and
[4:43] some keys so that we can come to a place
[4:47] that we allow Jesus Christ to sit on the
[4:50] throne of our spirit and rule and reign
[4:53] have dominion over our soul and over our
[4:56] body because remember we're trying in
[4:59] nature body soul and spirit Hebrews
[5:02] chapter five verse eight and nine
[5:05] said though he were a son yet learned he
[5:11] obedience by the things which he
[5:15] suffered we're speaking about Mashiach
[5:19] Messiah the Lord Jesus Christ though he
[5:23] were a son and he was indeed the Son of
[5:26] God yet learned he obedience by the
[5:30] things which he suffered do you see
[5:35] there was a process there was progress
[5:39] there there was a development of his
[5:44] perfection he was coming into his place
[5:49] of full adoption and perfection remember
[5:55] in the Bible when the Lord Jesus went to
[5:58] the Jordan River to be baptized by John
[6:01] the heavens opened up a dove came down
[6:05] the Holy Spirit came in the form of a
[6:07] dove and a voice from heaven this is my
[6:09] beloved Son in whom I am pleased to
[6:14] dwell or the King James says in whom I
[6:18] am well pleased other translations say
[6:21] in whom I am pleased to dwell and I like
[6:24] that very much very important words of
[6:27] affirmation spoken aloud over the
[6:30] Messiah then we read where he went to a
[6:35] high mountain with his disciples and his
[6:38] inner circle Peter James and John went
[6:41] with him they went up into this high
[6:44] mountain and he was transfigured he was
[6:47] glorified he was changed before their
[6:50] eyes his face was shining like the light
[6:55] of the Sun his raiment was even changed
[6:58] and glistened like gold and a voice
[7:01] spoke and said this is my beloved son
[7:04] hear ye him we understand through Bible
[7:10] history that there was an adoption
[7:12] process that took place in the Hebrew
[7:14] home the boy the oldest son though he
[7:18] were a
[7:19] son he had to prove himself there were
[7:22] some requirements and in the Jewish home
[7:25] today there is a celebration of coming
[7:29] to spiritual manhood or spiritual
[7:32] maturity called a Bar Mitzvah for a
[7:35] young girl it's called a bat mitzvah our
[7:39] bat mitzvah bat mitzvah and so this is a
[7:43] very very interesting concept that even
[7:46] our Lord Jesus made this progress he
[7:51] went through a process though he were a
[7:53] son not just any son the son of God yet
[7:57] he learned obedience total full
[8:02] obedience full surrender by the things
[8:07] which he suffered so you just remember
[8:09] when you're going through the process of
[8:12] suffering when your knowing turmoil and
[8:16] trials and hardship the enemy is really
[8:20] seemingly out there quipping things up
[8:23] in your life remember it is a part of
[8:26] your obedience training God is looking I
[8:30] feel the anointing right now God is
[8:33] looking for a people that will obey him
[8:36] that will move in unquestioning
[8:40] obedience yes Lord yes Lord what would
[8:43] you have me to do yes Lord where would
[8:45] you have me to go yes Lord what would
[8:48] you have me to say I believe that's
[8:50] going to be very important in this day
[8:52] in which we're coming as the sons of God
[8:55] into full adoption that we move into
[8:59] that place of of quick obedience where
[9:02] we don't have time do you know beg for
[9:05] further direction or understanding we
[9:08] just step out and you know sometimes
[9:10] that's very important in obedience God
[9:13] will reveal to us one step and as we
[9:16] step out to do that to obey that here
[9:20] comes further instruction so we don't
[9:23] just sit around and wait on the whole
[9:24] story the whole plan but when God gives
[9:27] us a piece of the puzzle we move out to
[9:29] do that part to put that piece
[9:32] into play believing that God would give
[9:35] us the rest that he will verse 9 and
[9:37] being made perfect made perfect meaning
[9:41] there was also a process of perfection
[9:44] and what that was it was the pulling
[9:47] down of the will of the flesh though we
[9:50] were God though he were God yet he was
[9:53] in a body of flesh that had a will that
[9:55] had a motion that desire and being made
[9:59] perfect he became the author Oh
[10:02] hallelujah the author of eternal
[10:06] salvation unto all them that obey Him
[10:10] did you notice the way that is didn't
[10:13] you say unto all those that believe
[10:14] under all those that repaired under all
[10:16] those that go to church it says unto all
[10:19] them that obey Him so obedience is very
[10:23] important in this process of developing
[10:27] our spirit we talked about how and I've
[10:31] just got to say this quickly we talked
[10:33] about how Adam God breathed breath into
[10:36] his nostrils ooh we read that right out
[10:40] of the Bible Genesis chapter 2 I think
[10:42] it was verse verse 7 the Lord formed him
[10:45] out of the dust of the ground and
[10:46] breathed into his nostrils the breath of
[10:49] life man became a living soul we talked
[10:52] about how Adam received both so life and
[10:55] spirit life and how that the soul is so
[10:59] nourished and and it gets so fat because
[11:02] it receives so much we receive so much
[11:05] into our soul through those avenues that
[11:10] we talked about last week memories
[11:14] imagination conscious affection and
[11:16] reasoning so much going on into our soul
[11:19] but our little spirit man is weak and
[11:22] Adam once communicated with god's spirit
[11:26] to spirit the ability to do so was lost
[11:29] in the fall when Jesus died on Calvary
[11:32] and paid the price then our spirit has
[11:36] become regenerated renewed but it must
[11:39] be developed we have to develop our
[11:41] spiritual senses so that we can come to
[11:44] that place where
[11:46] can once again walk in oneness Union and
[11:49] communion with God like Adam did spirit
[11:52] to spirit and the reason why we're doing
[11:55] this program today is we're talking
[11:58] about the fact that it is a process our
[12:00] spirit man must be developed built up
[12:05] strengthened brought into a place where
[12:08] we can live out of our spirit and not
[12:11] out of our soul or our flesh so we read
[12:15] Hebrews five and eight and nine five
[12:18] eight and nine to help substantiate the
[12:22] need for a process if our Lord Jesus
[12:26] went through a process where he
[12:29] developed his obedience then you and I
[12:33] will also go through a process where we
[12:36] develop our obedience where we develop
[12:38] our dependency on him and we get into
[12:42] divine alignment so that we don't live
[12:45] out of the will of the flesh or even the
[12:47] will of the soul but out of the will of
[12:49] God which rules through our human spirit
[12:52] Romans 8 29 for whom he did foreknow he
[12:56] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[13:01] the image of his son there is a
[13:04] conforming there is a molding a shaping
[13:08] a honing in and a lot of that has not
[13:13] happened in our spirit man you've got to
[13:17] be on the right atmosphere you've got to
[13:18] be under the right teaching you've got
[13:20] to have the right understanding for your
[13:22] spirit man to be developed because the
[13:25] soul of man is sort of hungry and it
[13:28] likes to to soak up all that we hear it
[13:31] likes to take up all that we hear the
[13:34] problem with the soul is that it filters
[13:36] everything that we hear through these
[13:39] different doorways that we talked about
[13:41] last week we want the word of god and
[13:44] the truth that we come in contact with
[13:46] to go beyond the flesh to move through
[13:50] the soul and into the human spirit the
[13:53] spirit that has been regenerated
[13:56] potentially back to the place
[13:59] Adam spirit was it was the essence of
[14:03] God it was the life of God it was the
[14:06] very deity the very nature of God and we
[14:09] have been called the Bible said and I'll
[14:12] share this verse of scripture with you
[14:14] also in another lesson but we have been
[14:16] called to be partakers of the what
[14:20] divine nature we've been called to this
[14:24] brother this is not just us trying to
[14:27] usurp our place in the kingdom we have
[14:29] been called we're living in the last
[14:31] days God has an overcoming body of
[14:34] people that are being raised up a holy
[14:36] remnant and we're being called to come
[14:38] into that relationship where we
[14:40] communicate with our Creator spirit to
[14:43] spirit to be conformed tells us that
[14:47] it's a process that a process is
[14:49] required that it's not instantaneous
[14:51] that we come into that place of total
[14:53] obedience and surrender it's not
[14:55] instantaneous that we live out of our
[14:58] spirit it is a process and it takes
[15:01] exercise and development and we're going
[15:03] to keep on until we come to a place of
[15:05] understanding how to do that we are
[15:08] predestinated to be conformed to his
[15:10] image what does that mean it means to be
[15:13] spiritually mature spiritually mature to
[15:17] come into the stature of a perfect man
[15:20] or the fullness of Jesus Christ in flesh
[15:23] we've looked at that before on the
[15:26] Eagles cry so we won't have time to go
[15:28] very deeply into that right now but I
[15:30] want to share another scripture with you
[15:31] first Peter chapter 1 the first part of
[15:34] verse 2 said elect according to the
[15:37] foreknowledge of God the Father through
[15:40] sanctification of the spirit through
[15:45] sanctification of the spirit to
[15:48] obedience and the sprinkling of the
[15:51] blood of Jesus Christ Peter is saying
[15:54] that it is just as important that our
[15:57] spirit be sanctified as it is for us to
[16:01] receive the blood sacrifice in other
[16:04] words we we come we have to have the
[16:06] blood the blood is what redeems us the
[16:09] blood is the bridal price the blood
[16:12] is the token for our salvation it is
[16:16] without blood there is no shedding
[16:19] without blood there is no remission of
[16:21] sin without the shedding of blood there
[16:23] is no remission of sin but equally
[16:26] important Peter said is that our spirit
[16:30] be sanctified think about it that word
[16:36] here means purification or holiness
[16:40] elect according to the foreknowledge of
[16:43] God the Father through purification
[16:45] through holiness of the spirit through
[16:48] sanctification of the spirit so now the
[16:51] Bible tells us here there is a process
[16:54] by which our spirit must be set apart
[16:58] there is a process whereby our spirit
[17:02] must be purified it must come into a
[17:06] place of purity how does that happen by
[17:10] the holiness of God God is holy he is so
[17:15] holy our minds can yet fathom or wrap
[17:20] around the true holiness of God but I
[17:24] believe God wants to release to us his
[17:27] holiness he wants to impart to us a
[17:31] measure of his holiness that will
[17:35] sanctify and set your spirit man apart
[17:39] from your soul from your flesh the
[17:42] spirit is to be set apart from the soul
[17:45] and from the flesh and we read that
[17:48] right there if you want to look at that
[17:49] again its first Peter chapter 1 and the
[17:52] first part of verse 2 when we come short
[17:55] of this when we come short of having our
[17:58] spirit sanctified we're forgiven through
[18:00] the blood of Jesus and we can move again
[18:03] forward toward this goal we've had many
[18:06] setbacks over our Christian journey we
[18:08] start working on the inner issues of
[18:11] sanctification we start working on the
[18:13] inner issues of deliverance of being
[18:16] broken free from all generational curses
[18:19] all things that have come down to us
[18:22] from prior generations we start working
[18:25] on that we
[18:26] are making some progress with living
[18:29] life abundantly and what happens
[18:31] inadvertently every time the enemy
[18:34] brings us into a place of temptation and
[18:36] testing and we seemingly lose ground but
[18:40] I want to tell you something we must
[18:42] keep on keeping on we must come back to
[18:46] the Father we must come back boldly to
[18:48] the throne of grace and say Lord if it
[18:51] was not available you shouldn't have let
[18:53] me read it in the word that's how I feel
[18:56] if this was not for me it shouldn't have
[18:59] been in the word I don't believe God is
[19:01] a God that dangles a carrot in front of
[19:03] our face that we can never eat do you I
[19:07] don't I believe if it's in the book I
[19:09] can have it if it's in the Word of God
[19:11] it is part of my destiny and I'm going
[19:15] to pursue it not not to think that I can
[19:18] do it on my own don't you think by any
[19:21] means that I'm saying that our spirit is
[19:24] sanctified by our works it's all by
[19:28] grace it's all by grace God gives us the
[19:32] grace to even come to the understanding
[19:34] that we need that so it's all by grace
[19:38] but there is a process and there there
[19:41] are exercises there are ways of
[19:44] exercising our spirit man nourishing our
[19:50] spirit man so that he grows up and so
[19:53] that he takes his place instead of being
[19:57] ruled by the flesh now that's how
[20:00] temptation works it we're tempted
[20:03] through our flesh we're ensnared by our
[20:05] soul and we end up involved with things
[20:08] that we know are not pleasing to God but
[20:11] if our spirit man was ruling our life if
[20:15] we were living out of our spirit then
[20:18] when the enemy came to tempt our flesh
[20:20] to try to penetrate our soul that's when
[20:22] our spirit would raise up with a hammer
[20:24] and cracker our flesh the will of our
[20:27] flesh kind of over there and say wait a
[20:29] minute you get back in the line you get
[20:31] back into your proper place so you get
[20:34] back into your proper place body flesh
[20:36] you get back into your position it's
[20:39] time for
[20:40] by an alignment spirit soul and body so
[20:43] I tell you I really believe God is going
[20:46] to do some mighty things in our lives as
[20:48] we grasp some of this so don't be
[20:50] discouraged if you try and fail if you
[20:53] mess up if you if you allow the enemy to
[20:57] distract you just catch yourself and
[20:59] quickly come back Philippians chapter 3
[21:03] and i'm going to read several verses
[21:05] here verses 12 through 16 and I'm going
[21:10] to read them in the New King James
[21:11] Version because they're a little bit
[21:13] complicated and I want you to get them
[21:15] the Apostle said not that I have already
[21:17] attained or am already perfected see he
[21:20] saw that perfection is something to be
[21:24] attained something that he had not yet
[21:26] developed fully but I press on here that
[21:29] don't you be discouraged press on that I
[21:33] may lay hold this is his testimony that
[21:36] I may lay hold of that for which Christ
[21:38] Jesus has also laid hold of me brethren
[21:43] I do not count myself to have
[21:46] apprehended but one thing I do here's
[21:49] part of the key here's part of bring
[21:51] bringing the soul into submission for
[21:54] getting those things which are behind
[21:57] remember one of the ways the enemy wants
[21:59] to rule your soul is by penetrating it
[22:02] through bad memory through bad memory
[22:06] memories of things you've done memories
[22:09] of things that that that haunt you you
[22:13] know memories can be haunting and you've
[22:15] got a you've got to have grace to forget
[22:18] those things because memories quickly
[22:20] turn into accusation you start thinking
[22:23] of things and the first thing you know
[22:25] the enemy is jumping up and down on your
[22:27] memory accusing you of being that same
[22:29] person and hopefully by the grace of God
[22:33] you're not that same man or that same
[22:36] woman you used to be forgetting those
[22:38] things which are behind and reaching
[22:40] forward to those things which are ahead
[22:43] I press say that with me I press toward
[22:48] the goal for the prize of the upward
[22:51] call I like the way the new key
[22:53] James says it the upward call of god in
[22:57] christ jesus king james says the high
[23:00] calling which is also very important in
[23:03] a good way of expressing it but I press
[23:05] toward the goal for the prize of the
[23:07] upward call of god in christ jesus do
[23:11] you hear that upward call you hear God
[23:13] calling you out of the realm of the
[23:15] flesh out of the realm of the soul to
[23:17] live out of your spirit that has been
[23:22] rejuven i regenerate 'add by the Holy
[23:25] Spirit of God I believe you're hearing
[23:27] the call therefore let us as many as are
[23:31] mature have this mine this is how mature
[23:34] people think and if anything you think
[23:39] otherwise God will reveal even this to
[23:42] you nevertheless to the degree that we
[23:44] have already attained because there are
[23:46] some things we have grown into let us
[23:49] walk by the same rule let us be off the
[23:53] same mind now I want you to know that
[23:56] the mind is very connected with the
[23:59] spirit the spirit and the mind are very
[24:04] connected and so our mind must be
[24:08] renewed daily we have to bring thoughts
[24:12] under subjection we have to work in our
[24:15] mind and the mind and the spirit is very
[24:18] connected so when you read scriptures
[24:20] about the mind I believe those words of
[24:23] promise and instruction are
[24:25] interchangeable with the human spirit I
[24:28] really believe that not all Christians
[24:30] I've noticed have that deep burning
[24:32] desire to press toward the goal for the
[24:36] price of the upward call of god this
[24:40] opportunity this invitation is
[24:43] conditional it's conditional everyone
[24:46] may not get it but if you get it you
[24:48] need to respond to it if there is a deep
[24:52] yearning in you that means there's
[24:54] something deep out there to respond to
[24:58] that deep call if there's a pulling a
[25:01] wooing a drawing it means there's
[25:03] something out there to fulfill that
[25:05] drawing
[25:07] Revelation chapter 3 and verse 21 will
[25:10] probably be the last verse I get to
[25:12] share with you today to him that
[25:14] overcomes will I grant to sit now some
[25:18] some people ask does that mean that this
[25:21] is for everybody no that's not what this
[25:25] said it didn't say everybody will get
[25:28] such and such and us it says to him that
[25:31] over comes they're going to be people
[25:36] who overcome in all things and they're
[25:39] going to be people who don't overcome in
[25:42] all things somebody said are there going
[25:45] to be Christians who don't overcome in
[25:47] all things I believe there are I believe
[25:50] there are I believe they're going to be
[25:52] foolish virgins I believe they're going
[25:55] to be people who do all that they can do
[25:58] but simply have not been called to this
[26:01] place of overcoming grace you see I
[26:05] believe clearly the scripture teaches
[26:07] there's a church and there's a bride of
[26:09] Christ and i know this is controversial
[26:13] to a lot of people but i didn't write
[26:15] the book i didn't i didn't write the
[26:17] book i didn't make this up out of my
[26:20] head this is the word of God God said
[26:23] here in Revelation chapter 3 verse 21
[26:26] speaking to the church to him that over
[26:29] comes to think that every person in a
[26:32] local church is going to come to that
[26:34] place of overcoming it's just not going
[26:36] to be that way to him that overcomes
[26:39] will I grant to sit with me in my throne
[26:43] there's something about that terminology
[26:46] in my throne that that speaks of joining
[26:50] into his authority even Oh as I also
[26:54] overcame here's another verse that says
[26:58] there was a process there was a testing
[27:00] there was a temptation in the life of
[27:03] the Lord Jesus Christ but he found
[27:05] himself obedient he overcame and to him
[27:09] that overcomes like the Lord Jesus well
[27:13] I grant to sit with me in my throne even
[27:14] as I also overcame and then set down
[27:18] with my father
[27:20] in his throne Matthew 2214 I'll share
[27:24] that one quickly for many are called but
[27:27] few are chosen I believe many of you
[27:30] watching this program today are chosen
[27:32] not for nominal Christianity not just to
[27:35] be a pew warmer somewhere not just to be
[27:38] a part of the of the of the whole
[27:40] picture you know just blend it in with
[27:42] with those who name the name of the Lord
[27:45] but I believe many of you are called to
[27:47] overcome I believe there's a hunger
[27:50] being stirred in your spirit man right
[27:52] now for the higher things of God and I
[27:55] want to pray I want to pray right now
[27:57] and I want to ask the Lord to do
[28:00] something extraordinary in your life
[28:03] father I just pray right now for those
[28:06] who are watching this program I don't
[28:08] know who is I don't know who is not I
[28:10] don't know who you're dealing with and
[28:12] who you're not dealing with I don't
[28:14] assume that every person watching this
[28:16] program is able to connect with what I'm
[28:19] saying but I do discern that many are
[28:21] and I ask you right now to send forth
[28:25] the power of the Holy Spirit to take
[28:27] this word of God deep into their spirit
[28:31] to feed their spirit to nourish their
[28:34] spirit to cause their spirit to be
[28:37] exercised and developed to bring us
[28:40] closer to that place of oneness and
[28:43] fellowship with you like Adam had where
[28:46] he communicated with you O Father spirit
[28:48] to spirit lord I ask you also for
[28:51] healing and for deliverance I ask you to
[28:54] bring about a change in circumstances of
[28:56] people's lives that are watching this
[28:58] program right now so distracted with
[29:01] circumstance so distracted with hardship
[29:04] in their life and yet father you're a
[29:06] loving merciful tender God and I asked
[29:09] you to send grace release grace to the
[29:12] hero right now Oh father I just believe
[29:16] Lord that you're doing a wonderful word
[29:18] in people's lives even now and I thank
[29:21] you for it we ask these things in the
[29:24] wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ
