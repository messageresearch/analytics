TRANSCRIPT
========================================
The reason for the misunderstanding is to get you ready for the tabernacle. &gt;&gt; It's to get you ready for the tent. &gt;&gt; It's to get you ready for the pavilion. It's to get you ready for the hiding place &gt;&gt; where he can set you up on a rock and let you sing the high songs of Zion &gt;&gt; no matter what's going on around you. &gt;&gt; Did you know heaven knows you by name? &gt;&gt; Did you know hell knows you by name? You're known in both worlds. You're known in both dimensions. And yet, the promise of God's word is, I want to hide my people in a place where they are undetected &gt;&gt; by the one who has come to destroy. &gt;&gt; Now, what have you got to do to get in that place? You've got to go through the vessel &gt;&gt; of misunderstanding. You've got to drink the dregs &gt;&gt; of rejection. &gt;&gt; You're going to go through that place of being scrutinized. &gt;&gt; Everything you do, criticized, &gt;&gt; misunderstood. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I don't like it. I don't know anybody that does like it. But if on the other side of that, I can hide in the folds of his tent. If I can find my shelter in his tabernacle, &gt;&gt; if he'll give me a pavilion where I am undetected from the enemy, &gt;&gt; I'm just reading the book. &gt;&gt; It's talking about a heavy glory. &gt;&gt; It's cavode kabod. &gt;&gt; It's a heavy glory. It It's what the old-timers used to call shakina &gt;&gt; shakana. It's a heavyweighted glory of God. And when that heavy glory comes down, you may not be able to scream. &gt;&gt; You may not be able to dance. &gt;&gt; You may just only be able to open your mouth and say, "Oh, &gt;&gt; I stand in awe &gt;&gt; of the beauty of my God." &gt;&gt; Is he beautiful? &gt;&gt; Let me ask you a question. Is Jesus beautiful? Is the Messiah beautiful? &gt;&gt; Is he beautiful to look on now? &gt;&gt; There was a time he wasn't beautiful to look on. No one desired to see him. Isaiah prophesied no clumliness was found in him. He was misfigured. He was misshapen by in by sin, by iniquity, so that no one desired to look on him. And the reality is his little bride that's transitioning in this hour from bride to wife, all we want to do is look at him. Because to us, he's beautiful. &gt;&gt; Here is his beauty. &gt;&gt; It's unveiled. It's revealed. He is standing now out in front of the lattice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's near enough to smell his presence. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about what the Song of Solomon says. &gt;&gt; The Song of Songs. Who is this that I see coming up out of the wilderness? &gt;&gt; What's the rest? &gt;&gt; Leaning. Leaning. Come on. Lean. &gt;&gt; Leaning on her beloved. &gt;&gt; It goes on to tell us she smells. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like he smells. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because she's been leaning on him. &gt;&gt; You lean on him, brother, sister. Lean on him, brother, sister. And you'll come out smelling like him &gt;&gt; because you've been with him. &gt;&gt; Because you know him, &gt;&gt; because you've been in the tent, &gt;&gt; under the pavilion, &gt;&gt; under the tabernacle, He's not looking for a a a badger skin tent anymore. He's not looking for a sanctuary of the cedars of Lebanon anymore. &gt;&gt; He's looking for a temple, a tabernacle, a shelter of flesh. &gt;&gt; He's looking for a body. &gt;&gt; It's in Christ where the bride becomes wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's in the word &gt;&gt; where the bride becomes wife. &gt;&gt; It's one thing to be engaged to Christ. &gt;&gt; It's another thing to be his wife. &gt;&gt; A lot of church people have flings, one night stands with the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; He's not looking for a for just a lover. &gt;&gt; He's looking for a wife. So, there's something about this pavilion. There's something about this tabernacle. There's something about this shelter, this covert, this refuge. There's something about this rock. There's something about this hiding place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That speaks of of rapture. &gt;&gt; It speaks of translation. &gt;&gt; It speaks of a change. It speaks of a difference that the word makes. &gt;&gt; It speaks about something that takes place in privacy. &gt;&gt; Not in the public view, &gt;&gt; not a public show, &gt;&gt; the door is closed. &gt;&gt; Enter into thy closet. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Or chamber. Amen. &gt;&gt; Close the door. &gt;&gt; That's where I'm going to talk to you. That's where you're going to find your refuge. &gt;&gt; That's where the change is going to take place. &gt;&gt; That's where you'll go in one way and come out another. Did you hear that? &gt;&gt; You'll go in one way and come out another way.
