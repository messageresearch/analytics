Tuesday Carter let me see you oh you look much better than you did in the picture Olivia saw the picture and nearly fainted She got weak you were not very pretty but God has really blessed you you're looking pretty handsome today he could have easily been really harmed anybody that goes face to face with a tree could really be harm so he may have some stitches for his birthday on Tuesday but he's alive let's thank God for that amen thank God brother and sister gy have an anniversary on Thursday the 28th and if I have it down right and I may not it would be 33 years 33 years that's quite an accomplishment let's greet them with a happy anniversary that's also sister Greta christensen's birthday she may be streaming the service today from Norway and if she is we give her our love and a birthday greeting that there are tons of birthdays next week I'll leave it up to brother gy to figure that out but I will mention one and that's sister Alfreda she is not here today she is sitting with sister Sharon's mother so that sister Sharon can be here today it's so wonderful to have you very very glad to have you this morning and we appreciate sister Alfreda for for sitting with her mom and sister Alfreda has a birthday and she's not here so I'll tell you she'll be 81 on tues day 82 82 I didn't count right so uh still going strong still has a memory like an elephant and so when you see her don't tell her I told the age just tell her I said she had a memory like an elephant all right amen Isaiah 61 1 and two the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach The Good Tidings unto the meek now this is a prophecy coming out of Isaiah's mouth he goes on to say he hath sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound have you ever been bound aren't you glad that he's still opening prison doors to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord if you were to look at that in Hebrew it would say the year of the Lord's Divine favor how many of you love living in the favor of the Lord that's why brother Cade got so emotional and anointed singing that I have been blessed he realizes he's living under the favor of the Lord I Saw Benjamin on the drums weeping because he realizes that he's living under the favor of the Lord we're a blessed people to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of Vengeance of our God to comfort all that mourn then while you're standing just a few more verses and this time from Luke chapter 4 verse 17- 22 we will share now the Fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy in Isaiah 611 and2 there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me this is red letter the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty Hallelujah Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all of them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day red letter again this day is this scripture that was spoken 400 years before this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears I don't know if you recognize it or not but we are a blessed and chosen people today because we can also say that we are living in the day that scripture is being fulfilled Hallelujah and all bear him witness and wondered at the gracious Words which proceeded out of his mouth and they said is not this Joseph's son they recognized him because he had grown up in the town of of Nazareth if you looked at the literal translation of those gracious words in the Greek it would be this he gave the message of Grace aren't you thankful today that we have heard a message of Grace it is not a message of condemnation not a message of judgment not a message of religion but it is a message of Grace unmerited hello undeserved favor Grace is unmerited undeserved favor you you it's not based on your uniform it's not based on your keeping of the rules it's based solely on his grace and when you meet M Grace when you are acquainted with her it'll cause you to want to walk a straight and narrow walk it'll cause you to want to Leave the World Behind you and serve God in modesty and in truth if you believe that say Amen father we need you today our hearts are full and we need you to come and let your word burn in us may it be for us as it was those two men on the road to to emus when we leave this house when we go out to the baptism trough may it be that somebody can say my heart was burning as the words of life were being spoken over me and if that is the case my God we will give you the glory and the honor and the praise for it is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the Saints said amen you may be seated I want to move as quickly as I possibly can because I will miss you now for three services and I I want to get as much ground carried uh covered as we possibly can and I want to introduce you to the fifth part of a series that we've been preaching all year and when I say fifth I mean the fifth section not the fifth service or sermon but before I do that I want to read a quotation from brother brandham I want to read from questions and answers number two 1964 paragraph 1 110 and 111 I want to see if maybe this will give you a little inkling of where we're going now this logos that was in him which was the spirit of God I want to remind you that we have been told that it was out of that great Fountain of Light of flashing colors and various manifestations it was out of that great light that the logos stepped forth powerful powerful and here we meet the logos again this logos that was in him in who in Jesus Christ in the word made flesh which was the spirit of God the logos was the spirit of God I'm going to pause for your amen the logos was the spirit of God now if you try to make it something else you're going to get confused and you're going to come out with a trinity or a quadruple of God or five or six persons making up a godhead but if you will let it be what he told us it was everything will fit right with the book the logos that was in him Jesus Christ God bless you Sister I just looked back and saw that uh sister Rebecca's made it back to us praise the Lord that same spirit that was of God was in Christ and he calls it underline there what did he call it the an the anointing when you have experienced the anointing in your life let let me ask you how many of you have ever sat and experienced or stood or laid on the floor and experienced the anointing it's tangible it's manifest it's not spooky spooky come on I I it's not metaphysical or ethereal it's real that anointing is real now I want you to know that emotionalism is not necessarily the anointing being loud is not necessarily the anointing you can scream something loud and not be anointed you can dance and shout and run and talk in tongues and not have the real anointing of God on your life come on so I don't want us to to uh make make equal the anointing and and and emotion or loudness but I'm thankful for a little emotion I heard a prophet say if your religion doesn't have a little emotion in it is dead and he said I can only think of one thing it's good for that's to be buried am I preaching to Believers today I need your help here cuz I want to go somewhere so now we've got the logos that was in him which was the spirit of God and it is also called The anointing so if you have ever been touched or have experienced the anointing of God you have touch the logos the logos has touched you that's pretty powerful cuz that's what stepped out of the great Fountain of Light that's what was from the very beginning of the beginning of the beginning he tells us before there was anything to worship that logos before there was anything to worship that that being that spirit because nothing had yet been created and therefore by the definition of the dictionary he wouldn't have even been God now we know he was God but technically by the definition of the dictionary he wasn't God because there was not yet anything to worship Him aren't you glad he fixed that aren't you glad it's one of the reasons why you were born you were born to worship God I don't mean to pick on brother Cade but I heard him say something a few weeks ago that has stayed in my heart he said I was born to worship if I would have been prophesying over him that's exactly what I would have spoke over his life you're born to worship but he spoke it over himself he prophesied over himself I I was born to be a worshipper amen now technically all of us were born for that purpose and some of us have received gifts and anointings to be able to do that to enable us to do that with both spirit and Grace but truly we were all born to worship all right and then he goes on through the sanctify I I'm I'm already cutting up the quote so let me go back now this Loos that was in him which was the spirit of God the anointing through the sanctifying grace of the blood brought many sons yes sir hello I'm waiting on an amen many sons to God not just one son Jesus Christ not just one son a prophet not just one son your pastor on but but many sons have come to God by the sanctifying grace of the blood they've been touched by the logos that was in Christ the very same spirit that was in Jesus Christ he emptied that poured that out on the day of Pentecost in the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you have received the Holy Ghost you have received the very spirit that was in Jesus Christ therefore the logos is now living in you not somewhere on the throne in heaven that same logos that stepped out of that great Fountain of Light which is the spirit of God which is the anointing which is the holy ghost is now living in you and how was he able to do that because he Sanctified you with his grace by the blood of the crucified lamb he cleaned you up somebody said I'm not worthy none of us none of us are worthy but he made us worthy how by the sanctifying grace of his blood which is Anointed The Blood The Grace the many sons are anointed somebody say anointed Anointed with the same this same logos so when you've felt the anointing you've experienced the anointing you've moved by the anointing you've ministered you've sung you've prayed how many of you have ever felt an anointing to pray you're just praying along dry as a bone pushing through with everything you've got and all of a sudden uh the spirit of the Lord falls down on your prayer and you pray like a Preacher Man you almost sound like you're preaching to God but you're praying you're praying under anointing you're praying under the influence of the very same logos that was in him which was the spirit of God it was the anointing through the sanctifying grace of his blood living inside of the believer brother that's good right there paragraph 111 now on the day of Pentecost it come down that Pillar of Fire okay there it is here's something else that logos that anointing that Spirit of the Holy Ghost that Spirit of Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost all of that he now says the pillar of fire that's the pillar of fire when you've seen the pillar of fire uh you've seen the logos when you've experienced the pillar of fire you you experiened the anointing there's not a dozen different things here we're talking about a dozen different ways to describe the very same Spirit come on the Bible talks about the seven spirits of God they're one they're one all of them are together one the spirit of the Lord so we're thankful to understand that because if we get that we know when the Holy Ghost has come in we have received the fullness the very fullness brother vom said all that was in the father he did what he poured into the son and all that was in the son he did what he poured that into the church on the day of Pentecost my my my you've got the same God that thundered on Mount sin [Music] living living inside of you he said on the day of Pentecost it come down the pillar of fire the logos and broke apart like that and tongues of fire set upon each of them do you believe that I believe it not their tongues but tongues of fire licks of fire set upon each of them a elected selected group identified by this Pillar of Fire showing that God had separated himself into man now let me show you what he's telling us there this was what we call Pentecost what the Jews call from the scripture chavot and chavot was a festival one of the three Pilgrim festivals of all Hebrews and they were commanded not not invited not suggested they were commanded every male Hebrew of a certain age was commanded to come and worship Jehovah worship God not in their Hometown on but in the city of Jerusalem in the Holy Temple so there were tens of thousands of people that had had uh crowded in to the city of Jerusalem that day the temple was full the courtyard was full the Roman stoa was full the ofel was full the southern sta that led up to the temple were full all of that area in front of the Temple mount the city of David full from the from the top of the oel to the bottom of the pool of Salim they were full of people the valley both both the kidan valley the whole The Valleys that that surrounded uh Jerusalem full of people every street full of people in fact we might as well get the the the paths that led up the mountain to to the Mount of Olives it's right there so all those little places on the way to Bethany full of people but the pillar of fire didn't come down to those who were gathered in Bethany or those who were gathered in the in the Roman stoa or those who were gathered in the Holy Temple didn't God say I'll meet you in the temple yes sir so those people were doing what they were commanded to do but the pillar of fire didn't come to them it came to a to a selected group of people yes sir a chosen group of people 120 men right amen women and children around but 120 men and he appeared to them on the day of Pentecost on the Festival of chavot and he filled them with the very logos he fil filled them with the pillar of fire he filled them with the spirit of Jesus Christ he filled them with the anointing so every time you've experienced the anointing you've experienced the favor of the Lord that fell on the day of Pentecost same logos help me help me same logos Same Spirit of Jesus Christ Hallelujah you know what that tells me that tells me you must be a chosen bunch of folks that's right amen you must be a chosen bunch of folks you must be elected you must be predestinated you must be called of God because you have been allowed to experience the same logos on the same Pillar of Fire the same anointing that fell on them and his falling on you some of you have experienced it I'm not going to try to put you on the spot so I'll cover up my eyes but how many of you have since the anointing since you've been gathered here today hold up your hand but I'm not looking because I don't want to put you on the spot but really it has nothing to do with me anyhow I experienced him for myself and I hope you did because you need a personal experience with with him don't you he said but tongues of fire set upon each of them a elected selected group identified by this Pillar of Fire showing that God has separated himself watch this into man somebody say that with me into man he was not satisfied to be Emmanuel God With Us he wanted to be God in us how many of you know it would be hard to be satisfied with having God With Us when you read in the book you don't have to be satisfied with God With Us you can have God in us by the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you don't have the Holy Ghost today you need the Holy Ghost I'm not talking about that portion of the Holy Spirit you get when your spirit is regenerated in Christ therefore I'm not talking about the portion of the spirit you get when you're saved I don't argue with anybody I believe you cannot be redeemed you cannot be saved unless a portion of the spirit of the Lord comes into your life but that is not the baptism of the Holy Ghost so if you're sitting here today or you're watching this stream in the nations of the world and you don't know that you know that you know that you know that you know that you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost I invite you to seek for it because he may be seeking you and if he is he'll fill you not with a third person of a godhead he'll fill you with himself Hallelujah and when he fills you with himself you become eligible yes sir yes sir brother to do what he did same signs yes sir Prophet said same signs same wonders same Miracles mark 16 in the life of the believer now scoffield wasn't sure whether or not Mark 16 was inspired but I'm sure and these signs shall follow somebody said that Bunch they're always following signs no no no no no come on signs are always following that bunch these signs shall follow them that believe they shall hands on the sick Hallelujah they shall cast out devils and I I won't do like some of the preachers around this message do and leave it there come on they shall speak with new [Applause] tongues it's part of the promise and the promise is unto you and to your children and your children's children with staving lips and another tongue will I speak to my people to you your children and your children's children and he didn't stop there cuz nobody knew exactly how many generations to put in there and so he said and as many the God as the Lord Our God shall call He's Calling My Children he's going to call my grandchildren he's going to call my great grandchildren if we're here that long Hallelujah and they're going to respond somebody said what if they don't hear the call are you kidding me they're going to hear the call because if the pillar of fire found a chosen bunch of people on the day of Pentecost to manifest the Loos of God he'll do the same again he'll find the chosen of the Lord and he'll pour himself out so if you don't have the Holy Ghost woo you can he's real he's not an it it's the anointing it's the logos it's the pillar of fire it's the the spirit of Jesus Christ anybody know where I'm going no you don't maybe you do he said God had separated himself into man and then he asked this question I'm back to the quote there charity do you get it let me ask you do you get it do you get it God the logos separating himself into man God not in one person he's in his church Universal now I'm not afraid to go ahead and uh you know kind of bring that down just a little bit he's in his bride church I don't know what man's church is doing I can't keep up with what's going on in man's church but I know what God's doing in his church right she may not have caui C caui woo she may not have coffee shops and but I'll tell you what he's doing in his church he's filling her with himself woo and I want you to know unlike Jesus Christ who had the very fullness of God each of us has received a portion of God and that means if you've received a portion that means there's more that means there's more if there's a deep calling it means that there is a deep to respond brother bam said there's one baptism of the Holy Ghost and many woo you people are good this morning you're getting sharper now as we go on many refilling I I don't know but I think I may have got a refilling this morning it it just felt fresh to me Hallelujah he just felt fresh he overwhelmed me as I was sitting there with the reality I have been blessed turn to your neighbor turn to the one next to you and say I have been blessed and if you feel this way you can say and you've been a part of my blessing if you don't then don't say it you're stuck with each other anyhow do you get it God the Loos separating himself into man God not in one person he's in his church Universal that's the reason Jesus said the works that I do shall you also more he said it he said more I'm going to have a people that storms have to obey I'm going to have to have a people that speak to tumors and they disappear I'm going to have me a people that speak the word and conviction strikes that's right brother and like hady wres Sons conviction Falls and them little snicker doodles is that what he called them Snicker Fritz Fritz okay folks you know what I mean Snicker frits I'm not from Kentucky so I don't know how those hillbillies talk all the time uh-oh did that get a little close around here forgive me forgive me no I think brother random being born in Indiana you know I mean in in Kentucky I think he had his own language though really I do he just made up his language and now we like it and we go on with it he he call them two little boys snicker frits you know what we might call teeny boppers oh no no I know this Young Generation my kids will say later Dad what's a teenie bopper I don't what they call him today I'm waiting y'all was so wanting to help me so bad while ago won't you help me now what do they call them now it looks to me like they're they're trying to go what I miss I don't want to miss nothing fun if you're having fun I want to be in on it he said you can't say it in church oh you can't say it in church you tell me after service I want to know now my mind is really in I want to know I got to know I have to know it looks to me like this generation wants to go back to beatnick come on now I see it I see men with beatnick haircuts and turtlenecks and they look just like do beill to me some of them I don't know what's got a hold of them but but here were two boys and they were laughing and snickering at what was being talked about but the anointing came and I I I give you your children in the name of Jesus Christ you might try to tell me that was only for a prophet or that was only for brother Brandon but I believe that every one of those five instances of the manifestation of the spoken word were speaking to us and God wants us to come to that place where we're manifesting that very same Authority in the creative spoken word of God somebody said I don't know when we'd ever need it well I I can think of dozens of there was a little fishy that lost his life and he stood up little fishy I give you your life and now people all all over the Internet make fun of that and mock that like it's some little silly thing but they won't be mocking when this little bride raises up with the voice of the bridegroom and cause for the resurrection because it was a little fishy then the next thing it'll be the dead in Christ because he said that bride will call for the resurrection it won't be her am I screaming too loud turn me up then it won't be her it'll be the voice of the bridegroom echoing you're just like a microphone come on so I can see why we need some of that I got to hurry I have to hurry now greater greater greater he said I know the King James says greater but the right translation there is more than this shall you do well don't more can't more does more have to mean more of the same not necessarily and I've looked at it in the Greek and I'm pretty happy with the way it comes out that what I did you can do that and and Beyond yes sir that's right God was bottled and confined in one man he goes on in one man Jesus Christ but now he's bottled and confined in the whole Universal Church of the Living God so whether it's just more of the same or greater I'm looking for it amen amen now the reason why we're in this little series and I'm hurried I'm really really really in a rush you just don't know it but is because I had this little thing with the Lord uh at the beginning of the year and the Lord spoke to my heart about this being a season of mountain climbing and I believe it in fact I've had to climb some and you've had to climb some already and we're just here at the end of March so if we've already had to do some climbing reaching for some higher Heights and it's just the end of March I don't know what we'll have to do come into the year do you but I pray Hallelujah I pray that we're so much higher up the mountain and uh remember that thatth word of the Lord came and said be very surefooted you you you've got to be careful where you put your feet you you know because you get it in in in uh rolling gravel and you may find yourself back Beyond where you started come on and and so you want to make sure like hind feet in high places that you become very surefooted I've watched that IEX as I have stood at edti multiple times in in Israel and I have seen that IEX at the very top of those mountains climbing up to the very top on on the sheer face of a mountain and you would from where you're standing you would think they're couldn't possibly be a crack or a gouge for that little thing's hoof to go in but he is scaling what looks like a straight up mountain right up right up at the top it's straight up and I have watched those icks do that and that's what the scripture is talking about when he talks about making our feet like H's feet so that we can climb be very surefooted so in this little experience I don't want to put too much emphasis on that but just to tell you why we're where we are today um I ask I ask the question how will we do that how how do how do we remain surefooted how do we make sure that we're climbing with sure-footedness does everybody understand the word and I heard five voices five things five people that I recognized and we have gotten to number five today the first one one I heard the voice of brother Perry green and I heard him say whatever you do keep your balance in the scriptures right so I preached that several Services read it to you from from the book acts of the prophet and told you the times that brother green would retell this story brother brandham looks at brother green and he said brother Perry whatever you do keep your balance in the scriptures because some people will take quotations way off out there somewhere where they can't ever even link them back to the book and I believe he knew that was going to be the tendency of the people you can get in some of those things that you read in the church age book that are not in the entirety of the message you won't find them anywhere else in brother brandom's preaching but you'll find them there in that church AG book and people would get way out there on a limb somewhere so disconnected from the scripture God must have known that brother green would have a tendency to do that so he spoke to him and I heard brother Green's voice I'm I I'm not trying to communicate with the dead I didn't see brother green I just heard the voice and you know that's a very for me a very familiar voice said whatever you do keep your balance in the scripture so I believe the Lord was saying to me at least if I'm going to remain surefooted this year and in the future I better keep my balance in the scripture the second voice I heard was actually the voice of brother brandham I recognize it you listen enough you'll recognize it some of you wouldn't recognize it if I played him here today because you don't take the time that you should take to hear what God has said to us in this day I heard that voice and he said whatever you do stay in the middle of the the road so I took a few services on that don't get too far off don't get too far off out there stay in the middle of the road keep your balance stay in the middle of the road that's the highest place the trash washes to the are you with me hello let me hear you and then I heard a woman's voice someone who meant something to me in my life sister Ruth and I heard her say whatever you do praise until the spirit of worship comes comes worship until the glory comes and then stand in the glory she was reemphasizing to me the importance of praise and worship someone recently visited this church and said man you people take praise and worship serious aren't we supposed to I heard where he said recently I found recently I'm listening to and he said it's the very reason yes that you were created you were created to worship God and he said when you come together to church you come together to worship God he said in that quotation it's the sole reason why you gather you see you could hear the word at home as this great movement is trying to tell us we don't need to be gathered together we just stay home and meet at the same time and hear a tape but that doesn't fulfill everything he said he said you your sole purpose of coming together is to worship God we need each other come on now I need you and you need me and we need to create a corporate atmosphere and then the fourth thing was some was a voice that I recognize if someone doesn't believe what I believe he's passed on now he didn't believe what I believe but he had some influence in my life I believe God used me in his life I gave gave you all those testimonies and I heard Bob Jones say whatever you do you must learn to love so I preached seven services on love and now the last this morning number five I heard my precious granny my dear old big mama she said whatever you do remember son the anointing how about you read it for me the anointing makes the difference how many of you know you can have a talent even a gift but it's not the trained voice it's not the trained musician that makes the difference it's the anointing that slices through the darkness it's the anointing that makes the difference and what is the anointing the logos the spirit of Jesus Christ the shakina of Glory the pillar of fire the full manifestation of God by the spirit and so I want to share this with you are you with me yes do I have I will say 20 minutes 30 minutes here now this happened just a few days before my grandmother passed away and I'm I'm just going to set the context of when she told me this she was uh dying you all know the story she knew she was and I had come down from South Carolina where I was pastoring was staying with her a few days my aunt was also there and I woke up one morning and my grandmother said honey I want you to go take a shower and I said do I do I need another shower I I she said no she said but this I want you to take a shower don't put on any deodorant don't put on any uh cologne or any spray or anything like that and and she said because I want to spend some time with you just you and I and she was doing that because she was it was her lungs it was in her lungs and the cancer started perhaps in her female organs they didn't find it cuz she didn't go to the doctor they didn't find it until it was already in the lungs and they wouldn't have found it in the lungs but she had that car accident in in Montgomery coming back from my Revival Ral in in montavo where I was preaching in montavo Alabama she had the car accident and while they were they took her you know she didn't want to go the hospital then you you remember the story she is she comes to herself sitting outside her catalac she has gone through the windshield as far as we know and all the all the windows were burst and she is sitting up against she was a large woman as you know and uh she was sitting up against the driver's seat door if I remember correctly with her back propped up against the the the car door and no one knows how she got there and she couldn't remember how she got there but she's sitting up when they get there and she has a laceration across all the way across her forehead and it had it's taken the skin and and the tissue and has peeled it down and she's holding it out of her eyes so that she can see the the paramedics it just just peeled it down it was still connected but just peeled it down and they said to her we've got to get you in the ambulance Michelli because they found her purse and her ID we've got to get you in the ambulance she said I don't want to go to the hospital she said my grandson's number is in there call him he'll pray it'll be all right and they said well h no ma' no no ma'am you don't understand you know you've come through the windshield maybe we're not sure how you got out uh and you you could be broken your bones could be broken we we don't know the extent of your condition and and at least you're going to need a lot of stitches at the very least she said I know what you said but she said you don't understand what prayer can do and she said if you'll just get in touch with him he'll pray it'll be all right and they said I tell you what we'll make a deal with you let us get you in the ambulance and we will call him on the way to the hospital well she agreed with that by the way I forgot to mention she had a purse under her arm when she's sitting there so we don't know how that happened while she is there in the hospital they're x-raying to see if they're broken bones and they find that both lungs are filled with cancer she'd never had a symptom they believe that it started in the female organs she decided to have a little portion of her lung removed and no radiation and she still lived several years and I don't remember now I'd have to sit down at least at least two years I think but I would have to look and see so now she's coming to the end of her life she's she didn't waste away she was a large woman she's lost a lot of weight she still looks good uh she still had somebody come in and put her hair up so it was still up in the Pentecost away and I just I ran immediately and took another shower I was going to do whatever she wanted me to do I was there for her so I come in and she began to talk to me she said sit down here on the side of the bed I want to tell you about a vision that I had and I want you to remember it and so I I wrote this I I want to give God thanks for RJ I don't see him this morning but he has done a real labor of love for me I texted him last night and thanked him uh again for what he had done he has taken a software and he has put all of brother brandom's recorded sermons all of the sermons here all of the prophecies here all of the Visions into one software to search so in about an hour I was able to search through every time that I have told this about my granny and I was able to pull together the details and I'm going to read it to you I didn't take time to write it well but that's not important for now she began to talk to me about a vision the Lord had given her she described seeing a large wheel something that reminded her of an Old Wagon Wheel I want you to try to see that in your mind an old western Wagon Wheel she said in this wheel there were spokes that went out in different directions that would be consistent with what a wagon wheel would look like is that right she said in this experience the spirit of the Lord would come to her and take her out a spoke of the wheel she said I felt myself journeying I felt myself traveling moving out the spoke of the wheel and God would let her see various conditions and Perils of the world stay with me just a moment she said in in one of those at the end of one of those fokes she saw famine she saw War she saw earthquakes she saw riots with people fighting in the streets she saw perverted Lifestyles becoming common she saw unrighteous living she saw people dying from dreaded diseases and afflictions such awful things she said some like she had never really seen before and after traveling down each one of those Spokes and seeing what she saw she would become so weary and so weakened from everything that she saw she said I even began to feel fearful of what it would be like to live in a world in that condition she described feeling like she would not be able to stand anymore she even began to say Lord I don't think I can see anymore I don't think I can take anymore she said I was very thankful that I only saw glimpses of these horrible things but every single time hear me every single time when she would feel nearly hopeless and overwhelmed the spirit of God would carry her back down the smoke I don't know how to describe it I'm just telling you what she said and I believe it and she found herself each time carried back down the spoke of the wheel into what she called the Hub of the wheel you know what I'm talking about don't you and she said at the Hub of the wheel was the [Music] anointing she would go on to say it was the of fire it was the shik of Glory it was the very anointing of Jesus Christ it was true she said in the hub I was overwhelmed and overshadowed by his spirit and His glory and everything she needed was supplied in those few moments hear me in the anointing she was revived she she was sustained the first time that she arrived in the hub she she told me that the Lord spoke to her and said daughter this is my anointing you will find that no matter what is happening around you there will always be peace and strength in my anointing keep your mind on me live in my anointing no matter what My bride is faced with she must remember my spirit my anointing will be available for her to reach out and take a hold of after a bit she would be ushered down another spoke and see glimpses of more more turmoil followed each time with a journey back to the hub back to the anointing she spoke other things to me that day very prophetic of what was to come in our church in our ministry she she described exactly what was going to happen when we came back to bring the message so clear but the dearest thing that I remember her saying to me in all of that Vision in all of that experience it was the last real conversation that we had together within just a day or so she would be gone she said this remember son the anointing makes the difference I want to ask you if you understand that the anointing makes a difference you may get to a place out there on the other end of that of that spoke where you feel so overwhelmed do you ever get caught up by watching what's happening around you in the world and you almost began to feel fearful of what the future will hold with crazy elections like we're having and and and all the the wokeness of our society and with the familiarity of perversion and homosexuality and all the things that that used to never be talked about and now they're being paraded on the television and in the movies and and it's in your face all the time and they can't even advertise salting crackers without doing it with two men two men have to eat saltin crackers together come on it's the sickness of the world we live in they want it in every part of our society and you get caught up some time looking at all of that swirl and you think I won't be able to make it just like granny had in the experience she said then all of a sudden he ushered me yes back down into the Hub and everything I needed hear me Church everything I needed to be sustained everything I needed to be strengthened was found in his presence how many of you found that to be so even in your own life are you with me yes I need just a few more moments would you go to Isaiah chapter 10 I knew it'd be a little hard getting that out but I wanted you to know why that phrase meant so much to me remember son the anointing makes the difference haven't you ever heard someone who could who could really speak and say such wonderful things and yet there was no anointing there and it just rolled off of you or sing with like an angel and it was such a beautiful sound but there was no anointing so it didn't penetrate it didn't strengthen it didn't bless it didn't favor your life it's because the anointing is what makes the difference come on you just I I I I I remember hearing brother random say you know uh you just get an old cornpone preacher Ju Just get somebody barely with an education he could say that and really be talking about his own self barely an education but he said when that anointing Falls nobody cares what school he's been to nobody cares if he can hit the highest note or the lowest note hello because it's the anointing it's the logos it's the spirit of the lord it's the pillar of fire that makes the difference therefore Isaiah 10:24 therefore thus sayith the Lord God of hosts oh my people that dwellest in Zion be not afraid of the Assyrian he shall smite thee with a rod and shall lift up his staff against thee and the manner of Egypt after the manner of Egypt for yet a very little while and the indignation shall cease and M anger in their destruction and the Lord of host shall stir up a scorge against him or for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of orb and as his Rod was upon the sea so shall be lift it up after so shall he lift it up he not be sorry after the manner of Egypt now I don't know if you remember the slaughter of Midian but this was quite a Slaughter it's found in Numbers chapter 31 and although we won't take time right now to get the detail God took 12,000 little soldiers from each tribe and God began to uh release that Army and they began to Smite the midianites killed their five Kings and all nearly all the men but if you'll remember correctly they saved the women and children the Bible said the spirit of God fell on Moses he was angry he was angry and he began to call out to them why did you spare the women and he said I want you to go back and I want you to slay all the women and their sons I only want you to leave the virgin girls alive that's right but every everybody else I want you to take them all down now that's a controversial happening you know the world that hates God and hates the Bible they don't understand these kinds of things but God had a purpose in getting rid of that midianite spirit and how it was vexing the Israelites and God gave them The Spoils of War he gave them livestock and goods and they were divided among the Israelites and a portion was set aside for the priesthood and so forth and you might remember some of that and so God is comparing through the prophet Isaiah the slaughter at Midian to how God is going to deal with the Assyrians so the prophet is prophesying to Israel and saying it may look like that Assyria is going to Prevail forever but just like God suddenly changed things in the camp of the midians there's going to be a change are you are you caught up with me and then verse 27 you you're you're familiar with this and it shall come to pass oh I wish you were with me because this is about to get good for anybody that has an ear to hear it and I hope you will and it shall come to pass in that day are you here that his burden the Assyrian burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder and his yoke shall be taken from off thy neck and the Yoke shall be destroyed because because of the anointing Brandy said remember son the anointing makes the difference I'd say in America we need the anointing I'd say in this church we need the anointing I'd say in my family I need the anointing I'd say in my life as an individual I need the anointing in this ministry I need the anointing it's the anointing that destroys the Yol now the Amplified says it this way did I give that to you charity no the Amplified says it this way and it's good for you to catch this because of the fatness stay with me because of the fatness the yoke is destroyed because of the fatness see it destroyed because of the fatness which prevents it oo glory to God my 18 neck is said Woo Jesus help me thank you Lord it's getting bigger spiritually I hope cuz I'm H you know I just bar I just barely butt in the 18 I was with Joshua a few minutes yesterday we ran in a Men's Warehouse with Joshua and I said honey they've even got 20 in neck shirts here he said I saw that I said I don't want one we're not talking about natural now we're talking about spiritual God is saying the uh the neck come on of the Israelites got so fat became so anointed so full of oil that the Yoke that Assyria had placed on her could no longer hold her back the anointing was so rich and the neck became so fat that the Yoke was burst from off of her neck from off of her shoulders anybody with me the Hebrew word used in this verse has more than one possible meaning we have words like that in our English as well let me explain how the Hebrew word is translated elsewhere in the Bible real quick I looked at all 100 93 verses I did myself not in a list looking them up3 times this Hebrew word is used in the Old Testament for anointing over say 100 1 73 times that Hebrew word is translated oil 10 times ointment four times Olive two times fertile two times rich as in rich food once it is translated fat or fatness and only one time and that's Isaiah where we read reading only one time is it translated anointing because the anointing and the oil was used interchangeably because God compounded a recipe for the holy anointing oil remember and the holy anointing oil was used to anoint the priesthood and and remember what the word says about Unity how how pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell together in unity it is like the the oil it is like the anointing it is like the fatness that ran down Aaron's beard all the way down to the cloak of His Garment so do you know what God thinks about people when they move together in the spirit instead of pulling against each other all the time when they start moving together in the spirit God says that's most beautiful thing it it's the anointing it takes the anointing to move together it takes the oil of God sir so I would say that that anointing that oil that ointment is precious and it's it's necessary and it makes a difference few more moments it's also come to be associated with the Messiah because the Messiah is called what the anointed one the NIV which I often refer to as the nearly inspired version says it this way I'm I'm shocked I want to be fair and I want to tell you I'm shocked by the accuracy of this particular translation in this particular place when it's so nearly inspired in other places they finally got one right in that day their burden will be lifted from your shoulders their Yol from your neck the Yoke will be broken because you have grown so fat all you people on the diet are squirming in your seats he not talking about physical fatness he's talking about spiritual blessing he's talking about leadership of the holy spirit in your life and you become so enriched so engorged so fat on the an my God I want to be so fat by the [Applause] anointing in the natural I would like to be a lot Slimmer than I am but in the anointing yes sir hey no I didn't fall I'm okay I guess I leaned over too far in the anointing I want to be obese I want to be so big that the devil cannot get a yoke on my neck so blessed that he cannot put a illegal burden on my shoulder hear me yes sir in the Bible a Yol was a wooden beam normally used between a pair of oxen or other animals to enable them to pull together on a load or a plow it was a common agricultural tool in ancient times for tilling fields and transporting heavy loads if I were to give you a simple definition of a yoke it would be this a device used to govern and control directionally right oh I'm mad come on I'm mad I don't want the devil to govern me I don't want this world and it's charms to have government in my life hello hello hello hello I don't want the passions of this world or the pulls of My Flesh to govern me or to control me directionally I don't want the devil pulling RS one way and moving Me In One Direction pulling them another and moving me let me tell you the devil will play all day with you if you let let him lay his yoke on your shoulder he'll play with you all day he'll jerk you all over this house if you let him but there's a remedy there's a remedy you don't have to be controlled by the Reigns of the devil any longer you don't have to wear his Yol you can be free you can get a neck so fat that the Yoke of the devil burst come on how because of the anointing it has been proven in our generation that you can take the most anointed message that's ever been delivered to humanity and make it no more more than Creeds and dogmas churches all over this world mostly in America and Canada sit like dust wads dust bunnies on a Pew afraid that if they were to get a little happy they'll break the sacredness of the hour not I'm not say everyone I said some and there's there's plenty of them so dead so dry sing the same old song get the same old results right nothing ever happening nothing ever moving preacher preach Like a Man on Fire out the door come on on never a prayer offered on never an altar call I know it's a Methodist tradition but I understand what God can do when you come close I believe I heard a prophet say that right here is the closest you'll get that's right to the presence of God when he comes brother brandom said he comes right down over that pull pit and he wasn't just talk about his own he said so you ought to want to get as close to this there's nothing in this box it symbolizes something I'm just telling you I didn't make it up and I didn't say it and it's not original so you ought to want to get as close to this as you possibly can I'm GNA let that sink in a minute so that means every opportunity that you have you ought to want to draw close not to the not to the desk to the anointing that it represents to the freedom that it represents to the are you hear me yes sir to the favor that it represents yes sir so hungry if you're hungry don't hang the back door if you're hungry come on every now and again I'm not trying to bust you out of your routine but ever now and again when folks come to worship why don't you come why don't you draw a little closer to the fire draw a little closer to the fire recognize your visitation hour let the spirit have control cleanse and sanctify your soul Oh Come a Little Closer to the fire I wrote that when I was 10 come come a little closer to the fire that's where God wants to meet you why because the anointing destroys the Yoke 10 more minutes metaphorically the term yoke is also used in the Bible to symbolize servitude and subjugation and oppression anybody ever been oppressed by the enemy do you get the picture here is an ox a beast of burden with the yolk on his neck you know enslaving it to the will of the master and forcing it into a life of servitude that's what the devil wants to do for you he wants to beat you on your back and tell you where to go but eventually this this oxen this Ox gets so healthy he's eating so good he's drinking so good he's feasting so fine that he gets so healthy praise God and so fat from being so well fed spiritually that his neck begins to swell the devil don't even know what's happening the devil says woo he's getting more energy more strength he can work harder for me oh the more he eats the stronger he gets he can work harder in the field he doesn't know that the very thing that he thinks is a good thing is really a bad thing to him because you are about to burst his yoke nothing let me tell you something nothing is going to be able to hold this bride down in the last days she's coming out of Oppression she's coming out of depression she's coming out of [Applause] bondage no habit no Vice no lust no devil is is going to be able to hold her in servitude you're going to become so spiritually blessed it's up to you it's up to you Feast not just on the word but on the presence you see there was some bread in the Tabernacle there was some bread in the in the temple called shoe bread or showbread you know what it means it means the bread of his presence take you a big old bot you bread lovers Texas Roadhouse is of the devil [Music] except when I'm in there eating like yesterday I feel like Nathan when I go I become a not little Nathan but bigger Nathan and maybe he'll be maybe there's something running in that name you better be careful that he may love bread like Nathan does you sit in there and one you know here here's let me let me tell you this if you wad it up it's only two bites if you're not careful you'll be five rolls in and three cinnamon Butters in before you know what hit you right I knew I was going to Africa I knew I wasn't going to get no hot bread like that and I thought one more time won't hurt I didn't have five by the way only two but I could I could have had a dozen it's so good it's not that bread that I'm talking about it's presence bread it's show bread it's feasting in his glory in his presence in his anointing I can't help it I hear these special songs that you all sing around here I know I'm about to be standing two hours I know that for my sciatic nerve and everything else I need to be resting here because it's about to be my turn to stand up but I can't help myself sister Rebecca when that presence of the Lord I'm I'm almost done when that presence of the Lord starts to move I want some of that bread I don't have to have no cinnamon butter with that bread I want that presence breed I want to Feast on that because I realize that the more of that presence I get under the more of the more of that anoint excuse meah I would almost apologize but I decided not to the more of that I get under the more my neck swells and the harder it's going to be for the enemy to lassle me and put a yoke on my you need the anointing you need the presence of the Lord is that right Aaron I saw you nodding your head is that right am I telling you the truth we need that presence I want the musicians to come somebody say well that's just a feeling you'll see you'll see it's more than a feeling when you start busting the devil's yoke off your neck when the things that have troubled you trouble you no more when you have a testimony like David had here Tuesday night that's when you have fed on pornography and fed on pornography until you get sick of it and one of these days you make up your mind you hear the word you make up your mind I'm going to fast he didn't SP it out as plain as he could have he said I'm going to fast he told me on the phone I'm not going to eat until I'm free I'm not telling you to do that God's not telling you to do that perhaps but he was leading him I gave him the same same uh little talk I give everybody you sure it's God do you believe God's calling you I don't believe in extended fast unless you know God's calling you to that cuz you're going to need him to sustain you and you need a prayer covering you need somebody praying for you I know you don't go around telling the whole church but you need somebody calling your name before the Lord and he said this to me and he even came to a place where he felt like the Deliverance was coming and he thought he could end the fast and decided not to and went on to the end he said to me I'm not hungry worked every day I said David you're going to try I I we shouldn't be talking about fasting with a name attached but anyway we're doing it forgive us he didn't say all this in his testimony just God freed him from something that he dealt with since he was 11 years old his neck got fat amen he got in the presence of God he cut everything else out of his life you start cutting things out of your life and get fat on Jesus get fat on that word let your neck start growing on that word and that presence of God come on I said David you going to work he said I'm going to work as long as I can when I can't work I'm going to have to explain to him why he worked the whole time strengthened cooked his wife breakfast at least one time he was determined I said you know son some people can't really go that long just on water it's according to your body the shape the condition of your body what's going on in your body body you got to watch that I said you can get weak way before the end of his fast he could have gotten weak to the point that he wasn't able to move go around and do the things he was supposed to do but he was determined and if you would have said this to me I might not have believed you but he said this to me and there was something in his voice that I believed that he meant business he said if I die I die I thought that sounds radical for somebody else to say but there was such a desperation in his voice he said then I'll be free then I won't be tempted and tormented by that thing anymore so God's either going to free me here or he's going to free me that way you got a family David you got a baby you got I know but I've had to make up my mind that nothing matters that's too radical for a lot of folks here this morning that's too radical for some of you come on especially folks that get to church once or twice a year but there Comes A Time In Our Lives when we recognize the only thing that's going to get us out from under this yoke is a fat neck and the only thing that's going to get us a fat neck is getting in that anointing cutting off the telephone come on staying off of Facebook on come on get in front of his face getting off on Instagram and and and all the other bluebirds and everything else and making up your mind I've got to get in that presence because it's the anointing that destroys the Yol I want you to put up the definition of destroy and I'm going to go I'm I'm done I I could preach another hour you know I could I feel it I'm able but I won't here's the definition of destroy it doesn't just mean to break it and then the devil come along and glue it back together right destroy means to reduce an object to useless fragments that's the Yoke that's the Yoke hello a useless form or remain as by rending burning or dissolving to injure Hallelujah Beyond repair or renewal to demolish to ruin to annihilate to put an end to to extinguish woo are you there and it all boils down to this and the Yoke shall be destroyed right because of the anointing let stand Lord we've got to have that presence in this busy crazy world it's hard to take time it's not hard to find time I I hate it when people say get that way you can find what you're looking for it's hard to take time to get in that word bless every homeschooling Mama teach your children more than their math and their science and their social studies they're in your Sanctuary during the week teach them what they need need to know to get along in life but don't you fail to teach them the things that will increase the anointing on their life one of the reasons why Landon has come to the place that he desires to be baptized today is because he's he sits in a home and I know this because I get uh reports from time to time from from Samantha of how they he listens to what goes on in church how it comes out in the in their home school and how blessed and happy she is as a mama to know that he cares to know that her children care about knowing something about the word what a freedom we have in this nation to build a sanctuary in our homes not to March our children down to Egypt where God has delivered us and called us out not to March our children down every day and set them under that tutorship we're so blessed come on does it make a difference it certainly it certainly makes a difference one of the things that crossed my mind when I was sitting there thinking of how blessed I am I thought Lord I Thank you that there has never been one sleepless night in my home because I didn't know where my children were right who they were with or what they were doing they've not been perfect they're not perfect now they'll get on my last nerve but I'm blessed I'm blessed that I've never had to sit Al an alarm I've never had to knock on the door I've never had to beg one of my children out of the bed to come to church I'm blessed and one of the reasons why is because their mother made sure that serving God was not just a Sunday Affair but every day Monday through Friday they heard their lesson and they learned the things that they needed to learn to appreciate it's quiet it is the truth and we ought to take full advantage of what God gives us there's some of you this this morning who've got a heavy Yol on your shoulder you've carried something so long you don't have to carry that anymore you just need to get under that anointing amen it may not break the first time you come you may be one that has to come and come and come and get in get in that presence and get in that presence and get in that presence it may be gradual it may be swelling and you may not know it and then one of these days hallelujah the Overflow stri show the Overflow strike you and what the devil is used to hold you back is burst destroyed and it can hold you no more oh let me sing that little song Sweet anointing

got to come to this church for a little while you do you have to come for a little while this baby wouldn't have look near this handsome had he not come here for a little while we have the prettiest babies there are father I lift this precious life to you yes you have trusted Thomas and Sarah to care for him you have blessed them and strengthened them and provided for them and you have given them this precious gift and today Lord I pray over his life I ask you to protect him and keep him in every way from the top of his head to the bottoms of his little feet yes Lord may he grow up to serve you to know you and to love you may he recognize at an early age the benefit of your presence sir Lord I pray that the darkness would not be able to touch him that he would be surrounded in the love and the light of almighty God that you would not only protect him and keep him physically but in every way guard his little fragile Spirit Lord until that day that you would call him to Salvation yes Lord let him lead this little family to deeper things in you yes because of him May their hearts be turned toward you like never before yes Lord father reveal yourself to Dad yes what a responsibility is now on his shoulder he took on the responsibility of Sarah a wife and now the greatest responsibility that he could have is laid on his shoulder to be a Godly dad an example of righteousness to this little boy because everything he learns in life and about life is going to come from this Mom and Dad and family and so Lord I ask that you would allow them to know you in a deeper way that you would reveal yourself to them in every way I bless this Precious Child we offer him Lord for your service For Your Glory may he always know wherever he lives may he come to know that he has a family in Alabama that love him that pray for him that will care and believe God for every good thing to come to his life in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen he's amazing let's thank

just a minute to get set up to get out there so you've got a few minutes to visit in the vestibule and and going outside when you can and and and make sure that the family can get close enough this is a new a new way of doing it for now until we can come up with something better but it's just hard sometime to to get people all the way over to the house and this is a way that we we will at least have something close I'm so thankful for this young man who wants to be baptized in the name of the Lord and we are going to baptize sister Rebecca radiant Hawken today too in the precious name of the Lord and anybody else that'll take his name it's the best decision you'll ever make in your life if you've been baptized in titles why don't you come and do it the right way do it the Bible Way do it the only way that anybody was ever baptized in the book I know what I know what Jesus said to Peter and Peter had a revelation that there is a name the father has a name the son has a name the Holy Ghost has a name and it's Lord Jesus Christ God bless you you're dismissed to go in the name of the Lord God bless you little brother thank you for your prayer love you too praise God oh sweetheart I
