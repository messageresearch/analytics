Description:
In this powerful experience in Jerusalem God showed that although every evil of every age is gathered into this most wicked age of Laodicea, there is a promise that out of this most evil age would come forth a Bride like no other.  She will be taken back to total deliverance, to God’s original thoughts of her.  Christ has to come in ‘Bride Form’.

========================================
but she will come forth with the overcoming power that was given to all the other church ages [Music] remember when i was in jerusalem and he caught me up into a heavenly place and introduced me to the messengers of the seven church ages now that's one thing i know is real and in that experience i was told that in the same way that all the evil of the other ages of the church ages that all the evil was gathered together into the age of laodicea so everything evil from ephesus and smyrna and pergamus and all these other church ages it was gathered together and expressed again in laodicea the most evil and wicked age the age of people's rights the most evil and wicked age of all the other church ages are you with me but remember he told me in that experience that in the same way in the same manner that all the evil of all the other church ages had been gathered into laodicea he said i have also gathered together the overcoming portion hallelujah so not only is this the culmination of evil in laodicea but it's also the culmination of all the overcoming portions so what god gave to ephesus and what god gave to smyrna and what god gave to all of these other pergamos and all the other church ages he has gathered together to form a bride like no other who will come out of laodicea she will have experienced the evil of every church age but she will come forth with the overcoming power that was given to all the other church ages why because christ has to come in bride form i'm the just some church member he thought of me he smoked me he sent me he made a world for me to live on even though sin perverted my life he made a way to take me back all the way back to his original thoughts about me i want to give you a definition of deliverance deliverance is being taken back to god's original thoughts concerning you that's deliverance when you get back to living the life that god ordained for you to live over here you can say i found my total deliverance until then we're still pushing still pulling still praying still believing you
