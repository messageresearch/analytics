able to lift up our voices and give God a worthy pray hallelujah hallah hallelujah he's worthy Hallelujah he's [Applause] worthy Hallelujah somebody said well we don't do that where I'm from well you're not where you're from so you can do do a little different when you go back home you can be a church mouse but when you come to Alabama you can just kind of get out of your little Groove and you can just Worship the Lord uh the way you'd like to and uh we're we're not going to tell on you we're going it's our secret amen would you thank God for these musicians this evening there are some of the best we're just happy to be in the house of the Lord Lord tonight I uh I have been asked several times if I am rested no I'm not rested are you over jet lag no I'm not quite over jet lag yet if you've never traveled abroad and been 7,000 miles away from home with an 11-hour flight and a three-hour layover and another 2hour flight that ended with an hour and a half being stuck on the tarmac in New York in JFK Anno in Atlanta because there was lightning in the air and if that doesn't make you nervous enough the airplane that had backed out of our gate to take off broke down at the gate and couldn't even start up I don't know do you crank an airplane I don't know it couldn't even start up they had to they had to come and tow the airplane now I'd have been some happy if I was on that plane I'd have been a happy man thank you Lord that if it was going to stop working it stopped on the ground instead of in the air but there was a little lightning and a tornado in North Atlanta and so we were stuck an hour and a half on an airplane with people who desperately wanted to get off and no one wanted off anymore than I did I actually sat there thinking oh Lord if you don't help me tomorrow there's going to be a video going all over the world of me just screaming you seen any of those videos where people just lose it on the airplane I said Lord if you don't come to my rescue I'm going to be famous for all the wrong reasons but he came he brought peace aren't you glad you know the Peace Speaker amen let's turn in our Bibles while we're standing this evening I this microphone sounds a little odd to me uh uh here in the monitor I don't know what it is but uh I had some of the best travel companions that anyone could have they were very very attentive to any need that I might have and they were an asset to the services there and uh I can hardly wait you know what uh it's only four minutes long you want to see it you want to see a little four minute snippet you may be seated just a moment can we we're going to play it in the morning but uh to next weekend I'll give you a full report of the trip to Ghana I didn't want to do that with all the visitors here so I asked Hawk if he would make a teaser and uh he worked pretty hard on it he has footage he took his drone he flew over the church he did all kinds of things and we have some amazing footage and can we just just play that can you dim the lights here in the front and I'm want to watch it tonight and again tomorrow it's just four minutes long I guess I ought to [Music] move [Music] just a few short days ago dad Hawk and myself landed in Ghana West Africa we've taken a short drive over to TMA where our hotel is and where the meetings are going to be held just just a short distance over there we're really excited to be here the expectation of the people is high and we're also expecting for ourselves this is my third time here and every time it seems to get better and better the atmosphere of the building is electric when you pull onto the property and then you go inside and it's even more electric with the worship we're just super excited for what the Lord is going to do he promised that where two or three are gathered he will be in the midst and there's going to be a lot more than two or three people there this weekend [Music] [Applause] [Music] so in the name of Jesus Christ let the faith of your people rise up and take you at your word I receive my healing I receive my restoration I receive my creative Miracle right [Music] now and I hope that I've been able to to bring a little something to be a blessing because these people are they deserve the best that God has that's the truth this is a wonderful place to be and help me receive the ministry of [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] our [Applause] [Music] [Music] praise [Music] not just one son but many sons are coming to maturity under the Dynamics of the resurrection of Jesus Christ H Jes say Jesus Jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] well I've been going to Ghana for 30 years but you can see who the star of the show is it's uh it's it's Benjamin for sure let's stand for the reading of God's word this evening and that'll give you just a little bit of a glimpse God did some outstanding things and we want to thank him for it testimonies are coming in every day of things that God did healings that took place deliverances that took place it's very hard to have a a prayer line or person a lot of personal Ministry in a crowd like that but you know our faith the people's faith is so high you just remind them of the promises of God and they just reach up and take a hold of it and then they go out testifying of their healing and it manifests and uh I I'll just share this with you quickly and and uh we we got on the airplane someone stepped forward at the last minute and said uh brother Shelly I'd like to get you a a little bit of an upgrade it wasn't all the way to first class but it was to a a middle business class that was a whole lot more comfortable and I thanked the Lord for it in fact I I cried you know I just wept that the Lord would make that possible and we got to New York I got on the plane the seat next to me was empty and uh at the last minute a a black gentleman come and sat down and and I thought well I don't want to talk to him but I'll just speak to him I'll just say hello I'm not a talker on the airplane and I said to him I'm glad you made it and uh he said oh yeah he said I I've been on the plane I was just in the back and and and I saw him tuck a badge in his uh in his seat pocket and and I saw that he was a Delta employee and I said oh you work for Delta and he said I do and uh he said I was just trying to decide what seats were empty and deciding where I wanted to see it and he said what brings you to Ghana and I said well I'm going to TMA and I'm I've been going for 30 years and I'm going to be preaching at a convention over the Easter holiday and he said oh I'm very familiar with timma he said I've been there many times and uh he said I I I know a pastor there by the name of Pastor Tay and I said well that's exactly who I'm going to preach for and he said do you follow the ministry of brother William brandom and I said I do and he said oh my goodness oh my goodness so do I he said and I live in Atlanta can you imagine and so we had a wonderful time wonderful time of Fellowship together he said now I'm going to take a little nap and he said when I wake up if you're awake he said we're going to do a lot of lot of witnessing and talking and testifying and we he did and the first thing he said when he woke up he said I I want to ask you to pray for me he said I feel like I've got to ask you uh to pray for me he said I have a need I said I know the Lord spoke to me while you're asleep now I'm going to tell you what the need is and we're going to believe God to meet the need and he did God is a good god he's the same amen Isaiah 61 verse 1 and two the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord the day of Vengeance of our God to come Comfort all that mourn then we're going to Luke 4 verse 17- 22 this is where we were when I left you just a over a week ago and there was delivered unto him the book of The Prophet Isaias and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me does that sound familiar to you to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set it Liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord in the original language it says to to uh to preach the year of the favor of the Lord the Lord's favor the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book it wasn't a book there was no such thing as a book for another 300 years it was a scroll and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day this day this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears how many of you count it a privilege tonight to be living in a day like that day where we as his bride can say we're living in a day when the scripture is being fulfilled in our ears oh what a blessing and all bear him witness and wondered at the gracious Words which proceeded out of his mouth and they said is not this Joseph's son now King James says they marveled or wondered at the gracious words the original literal translation of the Greek says and he gave them the message of Grace no wonder they marveled it was a new message to them they understood the Commandments they understood the Torah they understood the prophets but they did not understand for they had never heard before the message of Grace how many of you are glad tonight that you've not only heard the message of Grace but you become a personal participant you are a you are in cooperation with the message of Grace hallelujah what a blessed people we are father we need your help tonight our bodies are tired the Saints have traveled in from various places a and we need a refreshing I I heard that that utterance that was given earlier that this was a time of refreshing I receive that in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ May there be a refreshing go forth in this house tonight may we be renewed may we be strengthened may we be refilled again with the Holy Ghost in fire anoint our ears to hear your word tonight we're not asking you to ano anoint your word it is Anointed we're asking that we might be anointed to hear it to discern it to understand it we ask these things in the name that is exalted above every name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and for his glory and the Saints said amen amen you may be seated this evening I want to give you just a a a a few moments of review from where we were when we left you uh uh T not not last Sunday but Sunday before last we are uh talking about the the fifth utterance from a vision a Visionary experience that the lord gave me at the beginning of the year just as we were transitioning on the Gregorian calendar into the year of 20 24 um before we do that I want to give you a paragraph from the message questions and answers number two uh from Jeffersonville paragraph 110 and this will help you to understand what the anointing is we're still on the anointing we're going to be on the anointing in the morning and we're going to be on the anointing for for a few weeks now we're going to to emphasize the anointing oting well in order to do that we have to know what the anointing is rather we should know who who the anointing is you know we Pentecostals used to refer to the Holy Ghost as it but how many of you know the Holy Ghost is he he's a person somebody said well I thought he was a spirit he's a spirit when he manifested he manifested in the body of Our Lord in Jesus in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily so it's not this Holy Ghost is not an inanimate object it's not the third person of a trinity no no it's the very thing that overshadowed Mary so we know that Jesus didn't have two fathers so we know that the father is the father and we know that the Holy Spirit over Ed Mary and she became pregnant expectant with the very word of God's seed that was planted in her and since Jesus doesn't have two fathers we understand that the eternal spirit of the father is the Same Spirit help me preach a little bit The Same Spirit as the Holy Ghost we're finding out that many who are coming out of the Amish community and many who are coming out of even out of the minite community into something a little little little juicier than that are struggling with the godhead you see they're struggling with the godhead because they've got him as three different people but how many of you know he's not three different people hero Israel the Lord is one and if you want to summarize for someone just give them this summary Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the new he is God I'm telling you that is the gospel and if there's any other gospel being preached than that one it's not the gospel amen the whole book is about this revelation of who Jesus is he's God not just a Son of God he's God hallelujah and guess what he loved you enough that he revealed himself to you and then he filled you with himself oh my this is not a feeling we have this is a spirit of almighty God that has been poured out upon this little New Testament bride this little Omega bride he had an alpha bride he's getting his Omega bride together now is't that great I in the message that we mentioned just a moment ago paragraph 110 the prophet says now this logos that was in him which was the spirit of God the anointing you hear that so we can say tonight the anointing is the spirit of God and the spirit of God is the logos so therefore the anointing is also the logos so did you know that the logos is now living inside of you it once stepped out of that great Fountain of Light and now that very same eternal spirit of God is living inside of the Holy Ghost filled believer so the anointing is not a feeling it's not doing something well and someone saying that sure was anointed it's not how well you do it that makes it anointed it's whether or not the spirit of God has sh up has the logos come among us tonight he certainly has because I brought him with me when I came how many of you brought the Loos with you you brought the spirit of God with you you brought the anointing with you and because of the anointing because of the anointing the yoke is destroyed I'm going to need you to work on this monitor please something is not not quite right I'm not hearing enough in the monitor now he said I love the way he said this he said now this logos that was in him which was the spirit of God the anointing through the sanctifying grace of the blood oh my brought are you here brought what many many sons of which I am one anybody identify any of you sisters identify oh what's wrong with that crowd that even the sisters identify as sons of God nothing wrong with us we have a revelation that if a man can be a part of the bride of Christ if I can be his bride you sisters can be his sons well it's by revelation that we see it through the sanctifying grace of the blood brought many sons to God which is Anointed or which are anointed with the same same logos he's in me he's in me Hallelujah he's in me he said now on the day of Pentecost it come down that Pillar of Fire broke apart like that tongues of fire set upon each of them not their tongues but tongues of fire set upon each of them a elected selected group identified by this Pillar of Fire showing that God had separated himself into man now remember they were there for one of the pilgrim Feast they were there for chavot and there were tens of thousands of people gathered in Jerusalem that day to celebrate the Feast of chavot we now refer to it as Pentecost because of the 50th and there were tens of thousands some some Scholars say hundreds of thousands of people because every male over the age of of about 30 was commanded to come it wasn't an option for him it was a commandment to be there so we don't know exactly how many either tens of thousands or could possibly be several hundred thousand people and And yet when the Holy Ghost decided to come when the logos came when the pillar of fire came when the anointing came that day it didn't fall originally on tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people but he discerned and found 120 a select group an elected group a predestinated pre-chosen group with a prefixed destiny and he fell on them and they became fire starters they just spread the fire Hallelujah they came out of that they stumbled they they staggered out of that place under the influence under the inspiration under a stimulation that comes from Revelation and it spilled out and and and 3,000 people came and and then another several thousand and another and the next thing you know it's still spreading Hallelujah and there's a group of people in this little place tonight that have tasted some of that original mana and have experienced some of that original Pillar of Fire that original logos that original anointing not a substitute but the original the real one he said did you get it God the logos separating himself into man God not in one person he's in his church Universal he goes on to say God was bottled and confined in one man Jesus Christ but now he's bottled and confined in the whole Universal Church of the Living God that's many sons somebody say it again many sons not just one son unto Glory but many sons so when God was speaking to my heart concerning this new year of 2024 he said it's going to be a year for mountain climbing oh I like that I believe there's higher Heights I believe there's deeper depths I believe if there's a deep calling there has to be a deep to respond I believe we get spoiled on it sometime we we get used to it sometime it becomes casual to us sometime but I believe that that there is a hunger that's deep within the heart of this little bride for more of him and if you're hungry for more of God it means there's more of God for you to have for you to encounter for you to personally experience in your life it's not religion it's not church anity it's a personal Born Again encounter with the Living God Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and what forever and forever bless his name bless his name he said this is going to be a year for mountain climbing I like that because that's like God's saying to me I'm not going to leave you where you are I'm going to let you come up how many of you have read Revelation chapter 4 you know that's the Rapture invitation and how many of you understand by Revelation that the Rapture is not just a one-time twinkling of the eye but the Rapture is a revelation that catches us up into the fullness of Jesus Christ and so we don't have to say one day there's going to be a rapture we can say even now even now a Rapture is in progress that's right even now a Rapture is in progress because we're being raised up we're being snatched higher to sit with him together in Heavenly places God's saying to his little bride I don't want to leave you where you are I'm beckoning to you I'm calling to you I don't want you to become stagnant remember he said I would that thou W either hot or cold but but it's the lukewarm that sickens God he he's sickened by the fact that we so easily become lukewarm neither hot or neither cold for any of you that have ever worked in the field I remember as a boy those jugs of water how hot they would get as the sun was up it would be time in the afternoon to take a swig it wasn't nearly as refreshing ing in the afternoon as it was in the morning because the sun had changed the temperature of the water it wasn't cold any longer it wasn't exactly hot any longer it was now lukewarm and God said I can tolerate coldness and I can tolerate hotness but lukewarm turns my stomach and the lukewarm I will spew out of my mouth there's a modern Church world that's being expelled in this from the mouth of God but there's a little bride oh yes she's not going anywhere except up Hallelujah she wants more more Lord more Lord in 2024 we want more Lord more of your word more of your power more revelation of who you are we're we're so thankful for what we have and yet something in US says I I I want more so I said in this Visionary experience I said Lord how will we climb higher what would be what would be something that would help us to make sure that we don't miss this invitation to come up higher we're not just climbing any mountain Mountain we're climbing Zion Oh hear me now Zion is not just a place outside of Jerusalem in the Middle East but Zion is also a people and we're a Zion company do you understand prepared for such an hour as this and how is it that we're going to keep moving higher and I heard that that same voice that has spoken into my life so many times I heard that voice say be very surefooted be very surefooted you see the enemy would like to turn this climb into a slippery slope on he'd like for you and I to make a few little little progress you know climb a little uh an inch or two he'd like to swipe us right back down how many of you have ever had that as part of your experience feels like you get too close too step closer and something drags you back and you can never make any progress when you're going two steps ahead and one or two or three or four or five steps back and so I heard him say be very surefooted you've got to know where you're putting your foot you've got to make sure you're getting a grip and you're not going to climb the hill of Zion with flipflops oh I know you think I'm going to preach Holiness and you need some of it you know I came from that kind of Holiness where women didn't show their feet I came from that but I'm not talking about that tonight I'll save that for another time when just the locals are here you you know what a flipflop will do i' I've had on a pair I think feet are ugly and I don't know why anybody want to show their old hairy feet like a monkey I I don't get it but I've been in situations before where I where I was maybe going to take a shower in a foreign country or something I was glad to have something to protect my feet on and uh but you know they get so slippery those things and and you you slide right out and if they're if they're Old Navy 299 you'll just oh some of you know what I'm talking about if they're Old Navy 299 flipper floppers you'll just slide right out you'll just destroy them in one in one wet visit Oh no you're not going to climb this Mount Zion with flipflops on I ought to just go ahead and say it while I feel the unction you're not going to climb it with high heels [Music] on you you're going to have to get you something with some Traction in it you're going to have to be surefooted when you climb this mountain oh because the the gravels can can flow down and the rocks can shift and and it can get very precarious at times when you're climbing mountains yes sir oh I remember a time some of the the saints were just at Louisiana camp and there is a brother playing the violin on the stage there brother Hall he's uh uh I knew his dad brother Frank Hall in the UK and he's related to Mary Beth uh married to her niece is that right so nephew-in-law he's playing the violin I remember meeting him uh in the states for the first time in Sabino Canyon and we had climbed up in the canyon and he was part of the group and they decided they were going to run out I decided I was going to very carefully get out but these young whipper snappers my boys included they decided they were going to run out can you imagine all those little rocks and I mean I'm just walking walking at a regular pace and you step on the wrong place and your foot slides and you can twist your ankle and all kinds of things can happen but they decided they were going to run out and they did they ran all the way out of the canyon all the way out maybe did you did you go all the way to the to the visitor center there ran all the way out I'm waiting on the tram myself I'm climbing down I remember we come down a a a a path that I wasn't wasn't very familiar with and I was holding on for everything I had to get down and but here they go listen let me tell you something you you better not let your youth get to too far ahead of you here you you may think you're capable of running up this mountain but I want you to know there's 10, thousands upon 10, thousands of demon spirits that have been loose not against the church world not against the World At Large but the prophet said they've been loosed against the Bride of Jesus Christ did you know all hell is against you little bride did you know 10 thousands of thousands of demons are against you little bride you'll never run right up Mount Zion you'll have to climb it one step at a time one virtue at a time one birth at a time and you'll have to be surefooted right you'll have to stop sometime you'll feel like I'm not making much progress you'll feel like I must be wasting time but let me tell you there are seasons of speed and there are seasons of precision where we have to be very careful where we put our feet is anybody with us are you with me tonight are you just trying to rush me so you can get to lasagna or are you with me tonight and so I said how are we going to remain surefooted I I mean I've learned from these experiences you want to get get as much information out out of an experience as you possibly can so I said how will we do it how will we remain surefooted what kind of advice can I get so that I can remain surefooted and let this be a year of spiritual mountain climbing and I heard five voices one one right after another and I re recognized each of those voices and for the last couple of months I've been preaching on those instructions that were given some of you have heard it in the archive and you're familiar with it but there may be someone streaming or someone visiting tonight who hasn't heard the so very very quickly let me give you the five things number one I heard the voice of brother Perry green my friend and the founder and Pastor for 50 years of the Tucson Tabernacle a a real a real voice in my life a real constant uh a spiritual dad figure in my life and his voice the way he ex said certain phrases he never said the word he was a smart man but he never said specific I doubt he ever said it in his life he always said Pacific he meant specific but he'd always say pafic or Pacific and so his voice was so familiar to me and I've heard him say this phrase and you've heard it in his testimony and you've read it in his testimony book I heard brother green say whatever you do keep keep your balance in the scriptures you want to remain surefooted church then we must keep our balance in the scripture we can't go too far off into a tangent on any Doctrine we've got to bring everything he said back to the Bible and if it doesn't fit right in or you can't see how it fits you just leave it where it is if there's something for you to understand God will reveal it to you but you stay right in the scripture because this is the absolute now there are many people who will tell you that the tapes are the absolute and the books are the absolute I'm not one of those people you going to get quiet because I know what man touches what man manipulates you see 30 years ago we had a prophecy come out in this little church and God said much truth is laying on the floor of an editing room in headquarters now I'm just telling you what the Lord said and so if if that's what God thought about this that man had somehow perhaps at time had his hand in it then I can't call that an absolute somebody said what about the Bible the Bible is a Vindicated word it is brother bram's quotebook he called it the absolute he said everything's got to stand on that if it doesn't stand on that and Dove tail with that you leave it alone so I'm going to stay with that advice then the second voice I heard was actually the voice of brother brandom very familiar whatever you do remember stay in the middle of the road in Pentecost we we talked about a Highway of Holiness but the Bible doesn't talk about a Highway of Holiness the Bible talks about a highway and a way a highway and a way and the way shall be what the way shall be called the way of Holiness no fool or unclean thing will will Heir there accidentally get on that trail it's ordained of God for predestinated feet to walk on our understanding of that in church anity was that there was a highway there and off to the side there was a way the way of Holiness but that's not how God revealed it to brother brandham he said the way of Holiness sits right right in the middle of the highway it's not two different roads it's one road running right down the middle of the highway he said stay whatever you do stay in the middle of the road there's a lot of pressure that we feel sometime as Believers to get a little off balance even in Holiness sometime we get a little off balance we become a little legalistic we try to put a uniform on the truth you can wear the uniform and be lost so we've got to preach Holiness we've got to preach modesty we've got to preach separation from this world but we've got to stay in the middle of the road we've got to stay in the balance of the scripture because that's how we are going to remain surefooted as we climb this mountain not only 2024 but but for however long we have to climb I don't ever want to dip back down to where I was come on now somebody said back to where we were no no no no no oh no I want to go higher than I've ever been farther than I've ever been and then ver then number three I heard a woman's voice I know that shocks some people there are certain things that differentiate between a man or a woman I understand that brother brandom said a woman has every right to every spiritual gift he based it right on the word a woman has every right let me say it again in case some of you have been misinformed a woman has every right to every spiritual gift except handling the word so she can give message in tongues she can give interpretation she can have word of knowledge I know there's some who believes all that's over with that's why their churches in the shape it's in come on but we know he's still talking how many of you are glad you don't serve a God who quit talking in 1963 or 65 he's still talking to his bride how is he do it right out of the word right out of the message of Truth woman has every right to every spiritual gift except handling the word so women can bring inspirational truth to us a message you know when I say that I mean under the unction of the holy spirit so I heard a precious voice very familiar to me that of sister Ruth Hein some of you know who she was in the earth and she said this whatever you do remember praise until the spirit of worship comes worship until the glory comes and then stand in the glory oh if we could only begin to understand that there there's a there's an ultimate place that we want to get to when we praise there's a place that we want to get to when we worship we want to come right into the bosom of God we want to come right into the heart of God come on we want to feel his heartbeat and know exactly what it is that he would desire to say to us and praise is our way in I will enter his gates with Thanksgiving in my heart I will enter his courts with what with praise praise is is not just an offering that we give to him but praise becomes a weapon praise becomes a weapon we've seen Darkness beat back we've seen disease cast out we've seen depression have to go not only because of the preaching of the word or the anointing of oil or the laying on of hand but we've seen praise and worship create such an atmosphere you know this was the new ministry he talked about one that we wouldn't have to do prayer lines and the preacher wouldn't have to lose his strength and it wouldn't be him dragging out of here with no virtue but the word our praise our worship and the going forth of the anointed word would create such an atmosphere that the people's Faith would reach up and take a hold of God their disease would leave them their anxiety would leave their nervousness their depression their oppression would leave them their panic attacks would leave them just in that atmosphere so I believe I was being reminded that uh keeping balance in the scripture is important staying in the middle of the road is important and praise and worship is going to be important to make sure that our feet re remain very surefooted in times like these and then number four was the voice of a man who I happened to meet he was considered out there in the church World a prophetic person and I experienced some of the gift that was in his life and I appreciated him for who he was and I would I also appreciated his respect the respect that he showed toward brother brandom and his ministry although he was not a a a a full-fledged believer in this truth but I appreciated the fact that he could could say positive things when so many were saying such negative things and he was one who had this experience that he is standing before God he has a death experience and he sees uh several people we've we went through it if you've heard the series you've I don't have to repeat it all for you but the one person that I will mention is he saw a woman standing in line that was about to go in and inherit eternity and he noticed that her hands were all twisted up before she went in and he heard the Lord ask her this question he didn't say to her little sister uh what prophit did did you follow he didn't ask her what church did you go to he didn't ask her how she was baptized he asked her one question did you learn to love did you learn to love and you know what she answered brother ellias she said only you Lord I only listen I only learn to love you my husband left me in divorce and I allowed that loss to fill me with such a bitterness that I was never able to learn to love your people but I learned to love you and in our religious mindset we would think that he said you know I'm banishing you from the kingdom but he said no he didn't say that he said you come in I'm going I'm I'm bringing you in why because you love the thing that matters the most but but Bob said uh she she had no reward the only reward that she had was eternal life and I don't know about you but that sounds pretty good sounds pretty good she had no Crown she had no trophy she had no no wall of rewards but she learned to love the Lord well you know I want everything that's mine I I I really believe that if we love the Lord in this message it's necessary it's not optional it's imperative that we learn to love each other hello oh and when you say God I want to love your people he'll test you he'll send the most just look around see what God will do yes sir he'll send the the strangest folks in the world around you and tell you to love them hello I know some of you can't even smile now go you've not maybe you've not been tested as I've been tested in learning to love people it's a lot easier to love people when you see them every other month on now when you see them every Sunday and every Tuesday sometime you know you know I'm a little too good and I'm not just talking about me I'm talking about you we when you're in a local assembly you learn each other you you you may struggle sometime but you you we've got to win this thing because love is the key and love is transformational and love is who he is hallelujah and I believe we can that's right and then number five I introduced it to you this Sunday as I was leaving I heard the voice of my dear granny my precious big mama that's what I called her she was a large woman you know the story some of you may not she'd given her life to the Lord she was filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost in 1950 and she her her daughter my aunt an fell dead at her feet with rheumatic fever her mother my great grandmother mother Lizzy was the woman in the community who bathed and prepared the dead to be buried so she knew enough about what death was when my grandmother's daughter my aunt her only daughter dropped dead at her feet with rheumatic fever and when my great-grandmother Drew her up in her arms and said to her baby she's dead she's gone there's no heartbeat there's no breath my grand grandm mother who was not you know a longtime Christian she hadn't been too long giving her whole life to the Lord she said Lord I'll go where you want me to go I'll do what you want me to do I'll say what you want me to say if you'll just raise my baby up if you won't take my daughter I'll serve you the best way I can I'll do whatever you call me to do and the Lord heard that prayer whatever you want to think about it the Lord heard that prayer they they put that dead body of my aunt in the back seat of the car with my great grandmother holding on to her in the lap my grandmother's in the front seat they're driving all the way from from uh around clopton Kyle Highway 10 and in La L Alabama they're going to the hospital probably in Dothan and and it was uh quite a drive away and all the way she's praying Lord and just before they get to the hospital my great grandmother says oh and my grandmother said what is it Mama she said she's breathing darling she's [Music] breathing God did it he gave her many more years to live I just attended her funeral just a few years ago with my family she lived many more years well my grandmother didn't know how to keep that promise she didn't know what to do there was nobody to tell her she had a gift in her life of the word of knowledge and she would get words from the Lord about people's needs and their sicknesses and their problems and she would pray for them and they would come from everywhere well it somehow developed into a preaching Ministry and I don't mind to tell you she preached circles around some of these message preachers come on now I believe it come on now no don't hang up on me she give it everything she had and people came from everywhere to hear her and you heard the story and she went to the the the news reached Columbus to brother brandham was going to be in Birmingham and the Assemblies of God and that was the church that ordained her and the Assembly of God said don't go you can't go hear William brandham he's in false doct friend and you better not go let me tell you all those hundreds and thousands of people healed in Birmingham they didn't care one thing about his Doctrine they didn't care what he believed all they knew is that God was Healing The Sick and raising the dead and they needed help that's right and so my grandmother she began to ask around town who'll go with me who'll go with me well somebody go with me and nobody would go with her except one little woman whose name was Minnie Jackson she was so skinny that her back was sway like this skinny I mean hidebound just Skin and Bones brother Jackson was a big man like me be careful what you say right now I didn't need no real big amens in a time like that when I need them I'll ask for him no I'm kidding but anyway and so all the little children in the church would would talk about brother and sister Jackson and they'd say he must lock her up in the pantry and eat all the food cuz she is so skinny well she was an older woman by then she was in her 80s then late 70s probably then and my granny said sister Jackson will you go with me to he William brandom in Birmingham she said yes aring I'll go with you my granny said well you know the church WIll blackball us the church WIll boycott us because the preachers have already said that we're not allowed to go she said honey when you get as old as I am you can do what you want to and people just let you do it so they went my grandmother said to her husband she said honey can I go can I go with take the car and take sister Jack he said yes you go well they went and they stood in line all day and uh for hours to try to get in finally they got in and they had a service it was so powerful God did amazing things I believe the two sermons were a trial a court trial or a trial and spiritual Amnesia after that service they saw things they had never seen heard things they' never heard sister Jackson had a strange reaction she said I'm so homesick I've got to go home sister Shelly my grandmother said Oh Sister Jackson I can't take you home tonight she said we get to be here one more night we can't leave this Holy Ghost atmosphere sister Jackson said I'm just going to be miserable if you make me stay she said I enjoyed the service but she said I've got to go home and so they went all the way my grandmother drove 4 hours from northern part of Birmingham brought her all the way home remember there weren interstates and big highways like there are now got her home dropped her off we hours of the morning what will I do she said I I better go and wake up my husband and tell him what's happened and make sure he's okay with me going back she wakes him up in the middle of the night very smart very smart woman because she knew he wouldn't even remember what he said she woke him up in the middle of the night can I go back he said just get out just whatever you want want to do just get out of here and let me go back to bed she got in the car drove four hours back the same night got to the motel slept a few hours went down and stood in line to get in the service that night and that night brother Brandon was talking about uh uh uh Abram to Abraham and she was sitting there thinking H she began to count on her fingers Abraham ham a b r a h a m s letters b r a n h a m s letters she said oh my about that time brother vandom turned his back to the crowd and he went down a road that was pretty close to her and he began with his back to the crowd told the story of of how Sarah laughed and the and and they wouldn't have known that you know just went through this whole thing and he she said he called out names and doctors names and diseases and and Street of dresses and went down the hole and she said there was something so holy the atmosphere got so holy until you could feel the very presence of God in that room and she said I couldn't I couldn't make it fit my theology I wasn't sure what was going on I knew it was God but I didn't know how to describe it I made a a vow in my mind that I would never talk about it because I didn't want to say the wrong thing and blaspheme against it and so she said I got home and all the tapes that I had gotten the books that I'd gotten I packed them up in the my whole life she never mentioned the meeting she never mentioned brother brandom's name to me until I heard this message through someone that brother Dwayne Jackson knew well brother Gerald Cleveland and when I heard the message I wanted to come home and tell Big Mama about it and so I came home to tell her about it and I said you remember granny all those years ago when I was preaching that the spirit of Elijah would forun the second coming of Jesus Christ and you told me I might ought to you know tame that down a little bit she said oh yes I remember that I said well I was right I was right she said you were I said I was right the spirit of Elijah had to come a and and a forerunner had to come and a prophet had to introduce the second coming of Jesus Christ just like John the Baptist and Prophet introduced the first coming of Jesus Christ and I expected her to get all kinds of religious on me and she looked at me and she said his name wouldn't happen to be William Bram would [Music] well you could have blowed me over with a feather I said what you mean you knew that name and she said sent me up the ladder brought down the box with the books and the tapes in it told me the story that I just told you and I said well Granny if that's right then then he would have thus sayith the Lord he wouldn't be a perfect man but he would be a man greatly used of God and and and if he could give us something from the word we'd have to believe what he said if it was in the word wouldn't we she said yes we would I said well if he had thus sayth the Lord we'd have to believe that wouldn't we she said yes we would I said well granny brother brandham preached right out of that word that a woman has no place pastoring a church Church handling the word of God you say what church did she pastor this one not this building but this church I said then we would have to obey that as long as he could show us what was in the word she said well that's exactly right I never thought of it that way but that's exactly right and I said well granny brother brandom said it's not your place I had had this discussion with her several times through the years and she'd always said ain't no man going to tell me I watched my baby drop dead at my feet I told the Lord I'll go where you want me to go I'd had this you know kind of an argument 10 15 times I just finally realized I wasn't going to make any progress with her just let her do what she needed to do and and and hope that and pray that she'd be all right right with God no one could touch her life no one could touch the life she lived so I was going to let God judge her and deal with her but I just had the courage to come and tell her what had just happened to me and she dropped her head no argument no fighting no spitting no talking in tongues no rebuking me she just looked over there at me and she said you mean to tell me that I've preached all these years and pastored all these years and it wasn't even my responsibility I said that's exactly what I'm telling you Granny you did it you did it with a good heart and a good intention but it never was your responsibility to do it she said well I'll never do it again well I'll never do it again now to be able to have that kind of a testimony proved that she had a hold of something that was real and as brother brandham told us she was doing God a service without being in his will are you still with me I know you local people have heard that dozens and dozens of times but it's still the truth and so it wasn't so long after that that the Lord began to prepare our hearts to give her up I I won't tell all the details of how that happened but she was diagnosed with cancer and she she you know her her picture was on the front page of the newspaper because everyone who asked her she she also did income tax to raise more funds for the church for the work of the Lord and and she she uh kept doing that right up until the end and they would come in and they would know that she was sick and she would be coughing and she'd be going through a lot of trouble and they'd say sister Shelly how are you or Miss Shell how are you and she'd say I'm blessed so the newspaper come out and did an article and the headlines was I'm blessed amen she touched the whole city with her testimony I'm blessed I'm in his hands there's no better place to be than in his hands she had me to baptize her in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ never had the right baptism until then and it looked like she was you know maybe shrinking a little bit maybe maybe she was getting close closer to going and I was in South Carolina where I had heard the message and I come home to spend a few days with her and and that day she told me as I was sharing with you before I left she said I want to share with you a vision that the lord gave me and I I knew if God showed her something that I would benefit by listening to it and I sat on the bed and she began to tell me can I just read this to you she began to talk to me about a vision the Lord had given her she described seeing a large wheel something that reminded her of an Old Wagon Wheel in this wheel there were spokes that went out in different directions she said the spirit of the Lord would carry her out those Spokes and let her see the various conditions and Perils of the world she said she saw famine and War and earthquakes riots with fighting in the street perverted lifestyles unrighteous living she saw people dying from dreaded disease and afflictions such awful things she said some like I've never really seen before after traveling down each spoke she would become so weary and weakened from what she saw that even fear would begin to enter her heart and she describe feeling like she would not be able to stand it anymore she was thankful that she only had glimpses of those horrible things but every single time when she would feel nearly hopeless and overwhelmed the spirit of God she said would carry me back down the spoke to the hub of the wheel and at the Hub of the wheel was the anointing she would go on to say it was the pillar of fire it was the shikina glory it was the very anointed presence of Jesus Christ it was true in the hub she was overshadowed by his spirit and Glory everything she had needed was supplied in those few moments in the anointing the first time she arrived in the hub she told me that the Lord spoke to her and she dictated these words to me that day daughter this is my anointing you will find that no matter what is happening around you there will always be peace and strength in my anointing keep your mind on me and live in my anointing no matter what My bride is faced with she must remember my spirit my anointing will be available for her to reach out and take a hold of it after a bit she would be ushered down another spoke see glimpses of more more turmoil followed each time with a journey back to the hub back to the anointing she spoke other things to me that day very prophetic of what was to come in our church and Ministry but the one thing that I remember the clearest of all that she said to me that day is what her voice spoke in this experience as the fifth thing keep your balance stay in the middle of the road praise until the spirit of worship comes you must must learn to love and the last thing was my granny's voice and she said whatever you do remember son the anointing the anointing the anointing makes the difference didn't matter how black it was didn't matter how dark it was I want to tell you something tonight doesn't matter how rough it gets doesn't matter what 2024 holds or 2025 doesn't matter how many eclipses there are how many planetary alignments there are doesn't matter how many more CO's there are the anointing the Loos the holy spirit of God oh come on it's the anointing that makes the difference it's him it's not a Feeling it's his oil if you're doing something and God is not pouring his oil on it don't do it anymore it's the anointing that makes a difference I tell people I see little churches dwindling to nothing and if this church today was dwindling to nothing I would ask the Lord what's going on what must I do to have the anointing back because it's the anointing that makes a difference it's the anointing that causes the sick to have faith to be healed it's the anointing that drives anxiety out of the way and panic attacks it's the anointing that combats fear remember son whatever you do remember it's the anointing that makes the difference I want you to look I want to take just a few more minutes I didn't mean to take that long in uh in in uh what do you call it rerun or review but I want to take just a moment and close I'll preach in the morning God willing but Isaiah 10:27 I want you to look at it if this is for somebody here tonight I'm sure of it it's for somebody here tonight and it shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall be taken from off thy shoulder and his yoke from off thy neck would you read the last phrase with me and the Yoke shall be destroyed the Yoke shall be destroyed the Yoke shall be what destroyed destroyed because of the anointing it means to reduce an object to useless fragments a useless form show us the definition as by rening or burning or dissolving to injure Beyond repair or renewal to demolish to ruin to annihilate the Yoke come on now the Yoke shall be destroyed yes that's right your addiction to pornography shall be destroyed your addiction to pills will be destroyed your your addiction to marijuana will be destroyed because of the anointing Hallelujah I want you to know when that logos comes when that presence of God shows up in your life we we broke that down and I don't have time to do it again but we broke that down and we found out that if you were to boil that down to to its to its real meaning I I I I think I showed you the NIV let's do it you know I'm not an NIV fan when I look at the NIV version of the Bible I say it's nearly inspired version not not not not quite inspired ired but I want you to know they captured it here I'm pretty sure I gave it to you so if you've got it put it up there for me I may not have but here's what it says and it helps you to capture the real meaning of the Yoke being destroyed in that day their burden will be lifted from your shoulders it's a burden of Assyria the burden shall be lifted from your shoulders their yoke from your neck and the Yoke will be broken come on skinny people say Amen brother God said I'm going to pour out my anointing on you you're not even going to realize that your neck did did you know how important your neck is amen your I'm not talking about your wife my wife is not my neck you know the little funny you know I yeah you're the head of the house but I'm the neck and I turn the head let me tell you something the husband is the head of the wife but the husband has a head how many of you know what Colossians talks about holding the head of Christ that head is the most important head that's the most important Authority more important than your pastor more important than your Apostle more important than your Prophet more important than your organization or your little denominational version of this message somebody ought to help me your head is Christ and if you've got a weak neck if your neck is weak you can't Pro properly support cooperate Embrace Hold On To The Head the enemy wants to weaken your neck he wants to squeeze out your anointing he wants to weary you with the Yoke of Assyria and Egypt and Babylon but this was the word of the Lord the Yoke oh my people is Israel the Yoke shall be lifted off of your neck and the Yoke will be broken because your neck has grown so fat that the Yoke that the enemy once used to drive you to control you to compel you will no longer be able to fit you anymore and the the anointing in your life don't we need the Holy Ghost baptism don't we need the Holy Ghost baptism don't we need the spirit of God in our midst don't we need a holy ghost [Applause] service because that's what strengthens the neck the neck is what holds on and supports the head yes sir and God said I'm going to pour such anointing on your life that your neck will grow so fat that that old Yol that the enemy has used come on to control you sir will no longer be able to control you anymore because it's not just going to be broken God's trying to tell somebody here tonight I'm not just going to break the thing so that the enemy can come along and glue it back together put it on your shoulder and control your life how many of you have ever been controlled by something have you ever been controlled by depression have you ever been controlled by gluttony have you ever been controlled by lust have you ever been controlled by nervousness depression oppression anxiety fear if you've ever been controlled by something you want out from under it and you don't ever want there to be any possibility or potential of that thing ever being used to control you to make you Subs servant again God said that's what I want to do for my people I don't want to just break the Yol and let the devil come along and put it back on I want to send such an anointing such an experience such an encounter with the Holy Ghost that that yoke will be split destroyed annihilated in so many different little tiny insignificant pieces that the enemy will never be able to use it against you again anybody hearing me is anybody finding a yoke in your life that you'd like to see the anointing come before we leave here this weekend huh anything you're dependent on other than Jesus Christ anything that can control your mood other than the truth of God's word oh that wooden beam a yoke a device used to govern and control directionally the promise of the Lord it goes on and on here here was another here's another commentary uh Kyle and delit commentary and this is how it handles verse 27 I love it the Yoke like the burden will be taken away from Israel that's who you are your spiritual Israel we know that by the word of God one new man he said that yoke itself will snap that's not big enough but it's a start it will snap from the pressure of his fat strong neck against it this commentary seems to indicate that God is is going to place his strong neck where your weak neck has been do you understand that's who he is he's the God who can do for us did you know the other meaning of el Shai it's not just the many breasted one how many of you know there's another meaning to the to the to the title elshadai and it means the god of utter ruin and destruction The God Who can do for you The God Who can do for you anybody with me the god that can do for you what you cannot do for yourself does anybody need God to do something for you that you've not been able to do for yourself he Delights in that he longs to be that God in your life amen he he longs to be that God in your life amen I want the musicians to come I didn't get very far I don't think it's going to matter in just a moment how far we got because I'm depending on the Lord to come I'm depending on the Lord to come and help us now you've been sitting a while would you like to stand and stretch just a moment we're going to someone said no they don't want to stretch was that Liam that didn't want to want to stretch okay Liam you don't have to stretch honey no you don't want to stand up and stretch I want to stretch I want to stand up a little bit I want you to think about anything and everything that the enemy has been using to keep you under his control this is not just figurative it can be quite literal the enemy can place something in your life that you're powerless against but there's a God who's bigger than any problem who's bigger than any situation who's bigger than any condition and he wants to show up and show out in your life right doesn't have to be some big Grand display it just has to be a surrender are you ready are you willing tonight to let him pour His oil on your life are you willing to come into the presence of his anointing for just another moment and let God burst that yoke from off of your and the Yoke and the Yoke and the Yoke shall be and the Yoke shall be destroyed amen destroyed that's right because of the anointing Lord Jesus here we are tonight just softly something here we are and we've seen your strength today we've seen your spirit today we saw you moving Even in our fellowship today you came and anointed our worship and you anointed these brothers to sing using the gift that you've given them to take us into a higher place and your word has come tonight to help us to be surefooted to help us to be the mountain climbers that you have elected us to be I can feel the nervousness of that old enemy who has tried so hard to distract you because he doesn't want to to flee from you I'm reminded of the scripture tonight resist the devil don't cooperate with him any longer longer make up your mind I'm going to resist him and the scripture says to a Believer he has no choice but to do what he has to flee from you I would dare say because of the anointing that's on your life the enemy has to flee from you he can't ride you if you if you if you'll take away the saddle if you'll make up your mind I'm not toing the devil another day and letting that yoke squeeze me oppress me and trouble me I'm going to find myself in the spirit of the Lord in the presence of the Lord every time I can I'm going to find myself praising the Lord and worshiping the Lord I'm going to find me an atmosphere to get in hello I'm going to find me an atmosphere to get in that's higher than what I'm in now I'm going to believe that God will so strengthen my neck that no yoke that the enemy would place on my shoulders is going to be successful in controlling my life hindering or harassing me any longer if you're here tonight and you know that the enemy has used a yoke you might even be able to name it it's not necessary but you might even be able to give it a name as you stand there right now if you're determined tonight to find your Deliverance in his presence I believe he's here to set you free maybe it's fear maybe it's fear that tries to control you maybe it is anxiety maybe it is depression being someone who suffered with it myself I certainly know what a roller coaster life can be until God comes and sets you free from that thing I told in Africa the test testimony of how that my great-grandfather and my grandfather and my father none of them were faithful to their wives they were driven and controlled by a yoke of lust and I gave my testimony One Night in Africa how is just a young boy not even quite a teenager that Spirit came and wanted to take control of my life and I Lay All Night Long at the foot of my bed crying out to God for deliverance from that Spirit of lust and he met me there he delivered me from that thing that it would not have control over my life and because of that I know that it's broken from me and it's broken from my children yes maybe you're suffering maybe you're dealing with something like that and you'd like to be free from it I know the deliverer I know the one who can set you free whatever it is whatever is holding you if you recognize that there's something in your way I want you to slip out of your seat I want you to come and stand Brothers over here sisters over here I want you to come and stand for just a moment and we're going to try to create an atmosphere for that anointing
