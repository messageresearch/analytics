anyone has a prayer request by just the uplift uplifting of the hand which needs all over the building would you remember all of those who are traveling uh that God will watch over them and keep them brother and sister Greely in Virginia ministering to their families uh sister Judith in Michigan and then on her way to Canada want to hold her up to the Lord in prayer also Ben and Kendra and the girls and Josh and charity on a little bit of a holiday and then we want to uh and I'm so blessed that the Lord helped us in the worship it's very rare that all three guitar players are missing but you know with with these musicians it just carried well and I'm I'm relieved and thankful would you pray for Ashley she has transitioned to the hospital not not because there was an emergency uh the

done an ultrasound the doctor said everything is perfectly fine and we're just waiting on a good report that that she is here but let's pray for those who lost sleep during the night I know Emily was

uh if you've never been in that position that's the most vulnerable place to be and when you're of course a mother there's nothing like seeing a sister like that in that place but a husband you know a young husband it's hard and because you can't help there's not much you can do you can give ice chips and back rubs but that don't make you feel like you've done anything and so pray for David that God will also just give him peace and I know as soon as they see her then it'll be all right let's remember them this morning it's all standings are getting ready to pray remember Sister Audrey they

your life if he's not you ought to make him Lord of all he will be Lord of all or not Lord at all how many of you believe that oh my I don't wanna I don't ever want to I've embarrassed Paul so many times and I don't ever want to be guilty of that but if you have a voice like his and you're you're somewhere where somebody like that is don't you want to hear him saying and uh well we love him sister West and Paul and I have sung hundreds of songs the same song we've sung about 30 I think we had 30 or 35 songs we we did in the 90s and early 2000s and literally the presence of God would come and sometimes we'd sing four hours people would worship and get saved and get healed and we we used to sing that he's here he is here hallelujah he is here the presence of God so real so that felt real good and Paul is very blessed I know it I know he would tell you if you ask him to be able to sing with his mother and we're so glad that sister West drove all the way down here from North Alabama to be with us on my birthday weekend [Applause] I'm not going to tell her age she tells it sometime but I'm not going to tell her age but I will tell you this I've been pastoring here a long time how many of you know that I can't get it right are you fixing it and we did a little math it took us a while took me a long time I didn't sleep in an hour last night and I'm feeling it that's better I think I slept from 12 to 1 and then I just couldn't sleep no more it was time to pray and uh but anyway we were doing a little math and we we calculated that she was 51 I'm 55 now she was 51. when she came here to church the first time and let's just say that was quite a few years ago and and how old was would brother West have been was he he was older couple years about three years older so he would have been closer to my age he would have been closer to 55. we're blessed to have her today I want to honor her one more time praise God praise the Lord and then let me check here just to see if there's anything there's tons of texts but let's see if any of them are I don't see anything so it means that they're just playing that waiting game we want to stand and get ready for the word let's thank God for these musicians it's still popping out let's thank God for the musicians [Applause] that that might work Tuesday is brother Robert Graves birthday so he's in the waiting room of the hospital but we send a happy birthday to him we might remember Tuesday night we might not this may be his one shot and he missed it uh also on Tuesday is shoshana's birthday and Nathan's husband and wife share a birthday on Tuesday let's say happy birthday to them I don't see Jesse he's either at work or in the in the reserves he he's here unless I will be looking at him when he comes in we'll just pause a minute when he finally gets in we'll just all look at him of course he can hear me because there's a speaker in there I don't let nobody Escape my preaching once I start we pop it into every room in the house God bless you to every streamer that's watching this service you are a blessing to us and we love you today I I haven't taken a chance to to look but we're being greeted here from all over Southern Norway Indiana South Africa Canada Netherlands Arizona [Music] so many uh Ontario Canada that's all on YouTube plus we have a host of streamers on Facebook God bless every one of you and on the app and on the website uh Joshua had a few days off this week with brother Greeley gone and and the weather didn't look like it was going to be too good anyway and I decided I wanted to tape part two of the podcast on my birthday so that's how I spent my birthday and you know what that's a blessing it really is I told the Lord on the way over here that uh I want him to come I I'm I'm uh I like my life and I love my family and I wanna I Wanna Live as long as I can be strong for them but I'm I'm ready to go home really to be honest with you but I don't want to go without you I want to go in the Rapture I want us to go together I still believe that the Lord is coming and the and the dead in Christ are going to rise first and we which are alive and remain if there's any doubt in your mind all you have to do is watch the news and you know this song that Paul sung is going to be reality one day one two living in a house one taking the other left you want to make sure that your your sins are under the blood of Jesus Christ somebody told me recently said I'm not worthy I'm not good enough I've been terrible I don't care how terrible somebody has been you may be watching this service today and you may have have committed in your mind the most hideous sin that anybody could ever commit but I want to tell you something the blood of Jesus and the grace of God doesn't matter how immoral it was or how cruel it was there's only one sin the Bible tells us is unforgivable and that's blasphemy that's making fun of the Holy Ghost that's calling the things of God giving credit to the devil for what God has done that's pretty serious business but other than that even murder and I don't encourage anybody to try that but there are people who have done it In the Heat of passion and I want you to know the same blood that saved you can save them how many of you believe the blood of Jesus is powerful enough to save The vilest Sinner I promise the Lord on the way over here if he tarried I would like to live at least another 30 years if he would give them to me in strong body and mind if it can't be that way I'm not sure I want to sign up but if he would give me that but however long he gives me I want to spend every day serving him I do I want to serve him I want to worship him I said Lord I want to do more for you in these next years than I've done in the ones before so it was kind of one of them you know mushy days for me and I got over here and had the privilege of being interviewed by by my second son and that only means by birth time it doesn't mean by by favorite that was one of the questions that they wanted to ask me in the interview who's your favorite child of the four well I don't have a favorite I like them all I I I anyway I better not go there okay you're ready to hear some preaching maybe Romans if you'll turn there for just a moment I want to go to Romans chapter 8 verse 27. 31. I had wonderful while they're getting that I had wonderful birthday greetings from all over the world I'm telling you I felt so blessed I I looked down at my phone one time on on Friday and there were 113 different texts from people who had texted me happy birthday and it's wonderful to feel loved and appreciated isn't it we all need that sometime so all of you everything you did I had presents brought to the office in there and um gifts and food and all kinds of wonderful things thank you so much I appreciate it from the bottom of my heart are you ready and hear that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God and we know that all things I need you to say it all things good bad ugly all things work together for good just notice that doesn't say all things that happen are good they're not good everything that's happened in our life is not good but it's for our good for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose I don't know about you but I know that I know that I know that I'm one of the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified so we've got foreknowledge predestination calling justification and at the end glorified or glorification what shall we then say to these things if God before us all these things that happened to us nobody looks forward to heartache or trial or difficulty or disappointment but here we can know that if God before us if God before us come on who can be against us I want to ask you before you're seated how many of you know God is for you you gotta know it you've got to know that God bless you as you're seated you've got to know it is for you he's not out to destroy you he's out to conform you to the image of his son and sometimes it takes pressure like we were singing about just a moment ago to mold us into the image of his son now God knows just how hard your head is and I've been told that I got a hard one my wife is not here she will be after a while but but just ask her this pastor have a hard head she'll say he does God knows exactly what it takes to mold me into his image it'd be nice if it could all be candy and all be sweetness and all be wonderful blessings in our life but his sister Anita Curry wrote the song It's a mixture of suffering and blessing so that when we come out of life we come out smelling just like him conformed to the image of his son it's not easy to thank God for the hardship but like sister Flo said up here before her surgery she told us she reminded us of the story of the ten Boom family if you've ever been to to the Netherlands you have probably like me you have probably been to the ten Boom house where this family of Dutch people lived and the hiding place where they hid the Jewish people during the Holocaust they finally came and arrested the dad and the and the sisters the whole family and sent them to the concentration camps Bessie and Corey I met Corey ten Boom myself with my grandmother in in South Carolina and I feel so blessed to have been able to shake her hand Bessie and Corey were sent to Robbins Brook and it was a horrible place it was one of the places during the Holocaust where they ran the medical experiments on the Jewish people and those who had aided the Jewish people they implanted different things in their body to see how it would affect them and they were treated so cruelly and their sister Flo mentioned to you there was a terrible pandemic of of lice in that hole in that whole concentration camp I think maybe they might have originally started out in Auschwitz and I've been there many years later of course but I think she ended up in Robbins Brook and while they were there this great outbreak of lice and and Corey and Bessie in fact most women in those days had long hair and one of the things they did to to to stop this pandemic of Lies was to shave their heads and uh when I was in those concentration camps some years ago the hair had been saved and preserved and I stood and looked in a glass window about half the size of this church wall at mounds and mounds of hair every bit of it had turned gray even though when it was shaved off of the Jewish people's heads it was of all colors Through The Years detached from life it had all turned gray and it's just sitting there in Mounds and they knew that that's what was about to happen to them before they started handling it that way they were having Bible studies in the in the huge dorms that they had there where three or four women were sleeping in one twin bed and the conditions were horrible not enough food to to even deal with the hunger pains they were scratching so hard and so aggravated by the by those lice and Corey was complaining just a little bit she was murmuring just a little bit who wouldn't but her sister Bessie said Corey remember what the Bible said it didn't say for all things give thanks how many of you know what the scripture said it says in all things in all things give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you she said Corey we can't complain about that she said it's awful awful hard to get through it but we can't complain because she said look what God has done we're one of the only dorms that has the freedom to to teach the Bible and to pray with these ladies because the guards refuse to come in here because of the lies and she said we ought to be thankful this morning that God's given us the opportunity to read the few pages of the Bible that were smuggled in and passed around until they were tattered and torn and she said we ought to be so thankful that we have this opportunity and and and Corey wasn't sure that she could give God thanks for the lies and and that's when Bessie told her didn't say thank God for the lice he said thank God in the lies in all things give thanks for this is the will of God there's enough suffering in this room if you knew the lives if you really heard the testimonies of the few handfuls of people that are gathered here this morning you you would look at your life if you if you added all that up you'd look at your life and say I've had a pretty good life because there's so many people in this room who have been so through so many horrible things and it's amazing to me that it causes some people to question if there is a God it causes some people to say if there's a God he must not be good and then there's a Believer who says God is good in all things he is good in the good times he is good in the bad times he is good come on they've learned the victory of giving God praise in every circumstance because they understand that God has tailor made a life he has built a life out of his Destiny book for you and I to bring us to where we are in this hour I want to tell you this morning that the the greatest days for the Bride of Jesus Christ are not behind us they're just ahead of us pardon me they're just ahead of us and so we've got to press with everything that's in US knowing that he who foreknew us he who predestinated us he who called us he who is already Justified us is the one who's glorifying us in this hour if you believe that I want you to say Amen now we have made it through already four of those steps in God's Redemptive plan we've studied foreknowledge we have studied what it means to be given a pre-fixed destiny predestination we've talked about what it means to be called you see your God's foreknowledge of you and his predestination of you took place outside of time it took place in eternity before the foundation of the world and then when you were expressed into the Earth some point in your life the third part god called you he dealt with you about your life he lets you see yourself in the mirror and you saw your need for a savior and you called on his name and he was there how many of you that's your testimony he called to you some were on a bar stool some were in a crack house I'm in it in this room some were playing the Harlot when that voice called to them and said I wanna I wanna find you I want to save you I want to deliver you that took place in the realm of time justification took place as you begin to surrender your life to him repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins you did that because there was a wooing there was a calling there was a drawing of the Holy Spirit it made it very personal to you even the Bible can feel very cold if God doesn't call you to it if the Holy Spirit doesn't woo you to it and begin to reveal its truth to you once he begins to draw you to that word you can fall in love with that word and nothing will ever satisfy you like the word of God does there's a lot of things I enjoy in life but I there's nothing I enjoy more than being under the influence of that precious word of God and in the beginning the word was with God and the Word was God and the word became flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth how many of you are glad that the word was fleshed out it became a living reality in the earth and that word called you and wooed you some of you came through the Baptist and some of you came through the Lutheran some of you even came through the Catholic some of you came through the Pentecostals but you're just walking on and on and on as that light begins to draw you in a into a closer relationship with Jesus Christ and once you begin to surrender your life he justifies you and when he justifies you brother random said that's not forgiveness that's more than forgiveness that is though you never sinned in the first place now I want to tell you that's a powerful truth right there if God can so reverse your sin that there is no record that it was ever committed and he can look at you and never again see what you were before his blood touched your life oh I Want To Praise Him that makes me want to surrender my life to him but then it comes down to this last stage that fifth step of the Plan of Redemption where the Apostle said and to whom he he justifies he also glorifies let me give you the definition of that word to be glorified or being glorified it means to be magnified it means to signalize with a manifestation of dignity everybody turn to Jesse Jesse happy birthday this week we love you did you know it was your birthday you know now how old you're going to be 20 years old I like I've said before I have socks in my drawer right now that are over 20 years old I may have a moon so don't feel old yet you got a long way to go we love you Jesse we do it means to to raise something up to give honor to to extol how many of you are familiar with that word it's a word that means to praise to extol to lift up it means to to give or to impart a greatness a splendid greatness did you know that's the end of The Plan of Redemption for your life is that God wants to raise you up and give you a splendid greatness now there's nothing greater than being called to manifest Jesus Christ it's the invisible Union that we're talking about it's becoming one with the word that we're talking about and that's when we're raised up it means to be clothed with splendor if we know what foreknowledge means predestination calling justification now you can know what it means when the Bible said and you'll be glorified it means you'll be clothed in splendor it means that you will have a foretaste of the glory to come in eternity so that means that even while you're living here on planet Earth you can carry a measure of the glory in eternity the Bible said that we would be privileged to taste to partake of the glory of the things to come that means that while we are still living in this difficult life we get to taste the powers of the age to come now I don't know about you but that's what I want to snack on I want to snack on the powers of the age to come and when you eat of that which is to come you get over your feeling sorry for yourself you get over yourself you know loathing and you begin to understand I must not be so bad after all because he loved me enough to foreknow me predestinate me call me justify me and then let me eat the powers of the age to come when a man is filled with a genuine I'm about to get happy now when a man is filled with a genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost he has tasted eternity and therefore eternity is walking in his shoe leather and so when I feel old when I look at my hands sometimes and I wonder how they got to looking like that I have to remind myself that this is only the house that I'm living in that's aging inside of me there is a touch of Eternity that can never grow old it can never die it can never pass away and one of these days that which is temporal will give way to that which is eternal and I will receive a body change made like his resurrected body if anybody believes that you ought to say Amen glory to God it also means I found this definition this morning I thought I had them all it means to influence one's opinion about another to glorify God wants to lift you to a place where others can see who you really are come on you know when they begin to see who you really are don't you be surprised if somebody doesn't start wanting some of that come on now I went out to the to the ball field yesterday to watch a couple games softball games at my boys were playing and you know it it never ceases to amaze me how God allows people to be drawn to us before I got there Benjamin sent me a note and he said Dad we've been witnessing to this young man he wants the Holy Ghost I said what he wants the Holy Ghost and he wants to come to church next weekend and be prayed for to receive the Holy Ghost and I'm thinking what what causes situations like that to even unfold and take place and here come a young man I said you tell him he better come up here and say hello to me and he he walks up he's one I got onto one time for talking ugly I mean I got him good and he's never forgot it and he came walking up and he was so proud to tell me he said we're going to have a baby preacher we're going to have a baby and he just stood there talking and lingering around us and I enjoy it so much because I recognize that on occasion our Eternal uh part that part that is not of this world that eternal life that you and I carry by the new birth it squeezes out through the cracks sometimes and people begin to see that there is something that is not religion there is something that is reality how many of you want to be so filled with eternity that everywhere you go eternity just loses out of the pores of your skin and somebody says I want what you've got that's why our sisters dress differently than than the average it's where our brothers are called to live a higher life than those around us not because we think we're better than anybody else not because we think we have to do different to earn salvation we're doing it as an offering we live this life as an offering unto God who has been so good to us I'm telling you the goodness of God keeps chasing you and I down can anybody say Amen he's after you he wants to bless you he wants to fill you with who he is he wants to so fill you that those around you in line at the restaurant if you're brave enough to go to Walmart wherever you go God wants to let that light shine out of you in such a way that's part of the glorification that that caps off our Redemption to be glorified to influence one's opinion about another so as to enhance that individual's reputation you don't do that by bragging on yourself it's on what we're talking about here is something higher than what you can accomplish out of your own ambition this is God filling you so full of who he is that you can hardly help yourself it just comes out of your mouth it comes out of your language your vocabulary is influenced by eternity and the way you live the way you the way you choose the choose your to pay your bills the way you conduct your business testifies if there's a living God who lives inside of you is there anybody here who believes that being glorified as a fifth part of the plan five steps of redemption that doesn't mean going to heaven God's not talking to us in this scripture in Romans the Apostle Paul is not talking about going to heaven he's talking about something he wants to do for us now it's speaking about us receiving a revelation of his glory that works in US it's Christ in you what's the rest of that the hope of glory it's that portion of his glory it's the hope of his glory that's working on the inside of you and that's what we're after we're after Christ that we might win him we're not working this life for a for a mansion somewhere we're not working this life so that we can walk on golden streets and have a mansion and and see all the beauty all these things are beautiful to think about and Heaven is a lovely place but you know we're not working for heaven we're doing what we do in living what we live because we want to be a light and we want to be a testimony of the hope of Christ that lies within us the glory is working in US internally to position us to a place where we can fully step into everything written about us in the books you got to have it all there's a part of you that cannot surrender to God's full plan that he has written about you in the books of Heaven until that Glory starts shining in you and on you and through you and you start experiencing a true change one that is not about getting a good blessing in church one that is about going outside of the Four Walls of this church and living a new life I need you to be with me this morning we only got a handful or two here so we got to pull a little bit harder to get this out I want you to look at Second Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 18. this is one of my favorite verses here on this subject second Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 18 King James first it says but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed will you say that with me are changed into what you are looking into the glory of the Lord and as you and I look into the glory of the Lord there is a change that begins to take place it's the it's part of that Redemptive plan we're being conformed to the image of his son and the more we look upon him and the more we look upon his glory the more we're changed and the next thing you know we're we we look in the mirror and we see that we have been transformed to be just like him we're not wearing a robe and maybe long hair on our shoulder and walking about healing all the sick although the bride has a Ministry there's no doubt about that we're not trying to go back to the second century and and live like that go around barefooted and so forth this is not what's happening but what's happening is Christ is updating himself in a little bride in this hour and he's changing her from glory to glory it's part of the Redemptive work and the Apostle said even as by the spirit of the Lord how are we changed from glory to glory by looking upon him now most of us when we when we look in the natural mirror we see ourselves and I want you to know if you look at the mirror of God's word and you see yourself you're going to see every flaw you're going to see every shark coming you're going to see every wart and every blemish and every wrinkle but I want you to know the Christian doesn't look at the mirror of the word that way we're not looking to see how unlike him we are we're not looking to see every blemish and every Scar and every failure we're looking to see him and the more we look into the mirror and see Christ spiritually looking back at us and we refuse to turn our gaze to the things of the world no matter how ugly it gets around us we refuse to follow the depressive ways of the world around us and we just keep putting our face back toward him and we continue to see him and we choose it's a choice Even in our sorrow we can choose to see the Lord Even in our difficulty we can choose to see the Lord when things are shaking up around us the job is Shifting and we're not sure and there's unrest in our family and sickness in our loved ones and so many loss we say goodbye to those we love this can be a very very uncertain time to live in this hour but we choose I'm preaching to somebody I'm preaching to somebody if you'll hear me we choose to look to the Lord you must make that choice consciously and consistently I choose to see the Lord I choose to look upon his glory I choose to look upon his goodness I choose to praise him for what he's already done knowing that he's not losing me he's holding on to me and he's going to pull me through he has an intention to finish what he started you believe him do you trust him do you trust that he can finish what he started how about giving me that in the Amplified which is a lot I want you to follow this one and all of us as with unveiled face because we continued to behold in the word of God as in a mirror the glory of the Lord this is what I just said you're not looking into the word to see how rotten your flesh is come on folks look this way you're not looking in the word to see how rotten your flesh is can I settle it for you it's rotten I don't have to look in the word to see how rotten my flesh is my flesh is rotten my soul is in a struggle because of mind will and emotions so I don't have to look in the word of God to see how how far I I fall short I choose as the Apostle said here to continue to see the word of God in the mirror to choose to continue to see the glory of the Lord which means I choose to look upon the Lord and to do it with an unveiled face so that there's nothing between me look this way there's nothing between me and him I'm just looking at his goodness I'm looking at his faithfulness I'm reminding myself that he's never lost the case that even when I'm confused he never is even when I don't know what the next step is he already knows the path he doesn't just know my day-to-day he knows my future he sees my eternity and he's wooing me and drawing me the Apostle Paul said here in the Amplified as in a mirror we continue to behold is in a mirror the glory of the Lord we are constantly I love it we are constantly being transfigured this is the glorification process this is The Shining this is what's going to shine out of your life one of these days you know Paul and Silas even in their bloody condition beaten and maimed and scarred and marred for the testimony of Christ they chose in the Midnight Hour not to moan and groan who who makes that choice with me I choose not to moan and groan I choose to sing a song I'm Walking the Floor this morning at three o'clock and I was feeling the intensity of what Ashley was going through and I prayed until there were no more English words and I prayed until there were no more Holy Ghost words no more tongues coming and I almost got back into bed and laid down then and take a nap because you pray till there's nothing else to pray and all of a sudden a song started coming so guess what I just started singing walking around the bed just singing the goodness of the Lord I love your voice I love your voice for your mercy never fails me all my days I've been held in your hands from the moment that I wake up till I lay my head I will sing of the goodness of God all my life you have been faithful you won't be pretty but we're gonna get it out [Music] then so with every breath able oh I will sing of the goodness of God I love your voice you have led me through the fire and in darkest nights you are close like no other I've known you as a father I've known you as a friend and I have lived in the goodness of God all my life [Music] all my life stronger with every breath that I am oh I will sing of the goodness of God hallelujah give him praise for your goodness is running after me [Applause] it wasn't necessary for you to stand but some of you did and when you did I looked back there and I saw Michael and crystalline sitting behind sister Weston Paul and I thought no wonder they're on their feet they're told you no this happens sometime that one twin absorbs the other twin so you know you need to be aware of that and one is smaller than the other all these things run through your mind and all the things they tell you and the things you read and even sometime crystalline the things church people will tell you trying to help you and all that just rolls over on you and weighs you down and then you are forced to make a decision I'm going to trust in the goodness of God and then they say we're going to take the babies on certain day we're going to take no no we got to take them sooner than that and we've got to take them sooner than that we got to do this we got to do that they're doing all they know to do God bless the doctors and nurses and caretakers but they don't know it all anybody here they don't know it all and she goes up to that hospital it's early her blood pressure goes up and it looks like things are going haywire in the body the body's in some kind of shock they don't know what all is going on but she goes right in there her mother and others have told me she's cracking jokes with the nurses if you can get in a laugh you might as well there's not enough money in life come on life can get serious in a hurry I'm sure she wasn't just laughing the whole time come on but any chance she could get a little smile out of somebody she was doing that and God allowed her to birth those children naturally [Music] they didn't have to be taking C-section and they were early and and so there's a little inconvenience and a little little you know uncertainty a lot of things going on and here Michael and crystalline who desire to be with their babies but but also desired to be in God's house this morning if for no other reason to raise their hands and say I have lived in the goodness of God come on Look What the Lord Has Done they're gaining weight and it's not going to be too much longer that they're going to be just absolutely fine God is good you've got to choose to see him you've got to choose a song when you want to be in agony sometime when you want sympathy sometime when you want somebody to feel bad with you sometime you have to choose a song because every bit of this is a part of your glorification he did a good job for knowing you he did a good job predestinating you calling you justifying you and he's doing a good job glorifying his bride and her with his light are you still here oh put my verse back up all of us as with unveiled face because we continued to behold in the word of God is in a mirror the glory of the Lord are constantly being transfigured into his very own image listen in ever increasing splendor are you reading ahead and from one degree I caught you and from one degree of Glory to another from glory to glory he's changing me changing me changing me likeness and image to perfect in me Jesus the light oh got it let's sing it again from glory to glory he's changing me changing me changing me is an image to reap me light of God shown to the love of God again from Glory thank you Austin it's about time changing me changing me this an image to perfect in me the love of God shown to the world for his changing changing me from Earth lead things to the Heavenly his likeness and image to perfect in me the love of God shown to the world again for his changing changing me from Earth [Music] his likeness and image to perfect in me the love of God again for he's changing changing me from her Heavenly his likeness and image to perfect in me the love of God shown to the world of Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah Hallelujah in ever increasing splendor and from one degree of Glory to another 318 second Corinthians from one degree of Glory to another for this comes from the Lord who is the spirit we're not always patient but he's working on us from glory to glory from one degree of Glory to another and when we step into that place of glory and that's where I tell you the bride better be there in 2023 we better be finding ourself in that position of Glory that place of Revelation and when we get there we begin to live the dream that God had about us before the beginning in Colossians 1 27 it says to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory this is the place where everything we've gone through good or bad works together to propel us into our ultimate Destiny we can call this stage of redemption this glorification stage we can call it a point of convergence because everything that God was doing for us up to this point it starts weaving together in a place of convergence to propel us how many of you know what that means to push us forward into completing his Destiny plan for our life that's what I was telling him Lord everything I've been through up till now I'm ready for you to propel me I'm ready for you to push me into finishing this job that you have sent me here to do we see this in the life of Joseph when he was in his father's house but then sold into slavery by jealous Brothers he ended up ruling over the house of potiphar because he was cast into prison unjustly after which he was promoted from this most unlikely place to the prime minister of Egypt he went from the prison to the prime minister he became the preserver of life that God had destined him to be as it was written in the books of Heaven all these things work together and converged together think of this to prepare and to get Joseph to his appointed Place God knows how to squeeze you to the right place you wasn't born in Alabama he knows how to get you to Alabama if that's part of his destiny for you if that's part of your plan he knows how to get you here so you quit making fun of the way we talk now [Music] and don't make fun of our Red Dirt none of us think it's pretty but we've learned that if we find good in where we're planted I'm going to tell you this you've already heard it but many years ago a precious sister that we were blessed to meet prophetically years ago had a call from God the Calvary Pentecostal Church in in Richmond Virginia they had a call from God to send young people to Jerusalem to pray and 53 young people packed their suitcases and went to Israel for for some of them for several years some of them for several months and their their commission from the Lord was to find themselves on Mount Zion daily and pray you know that's a commission it's one that most of us would struggle with it was quite a sacrifice there weren't very few Full Gospel meetings going on in Jerusalem those many years ago in the 70s early 70s very few Spirit-filled meetings going on in Israel during that time but here they go a bunch of them single women a bunch of uh young single women in their 20s some in their 30s never never married but there were also young brothers and and a few couple married couples that went and every day they found themselves standing out in Mount Zion praying and singing to the Lord and one day the fathers the the priest at the church of Saint Peter of galakantu they came and said would you all like to use our church for these prayer gatherings and it shocked them that they were being invited into the Catholic Church to use the the room there to begin to pray they said well we we speak in tongues and they said that don't matter and they said well we dance as part of our worship that don't matter they said well we prophesy as part of our worship they said that don't matter we just want you to come inside we don't want to see out here when it's raining and so they begin and those meetings begin to grow and God began to do great things and years later I got to come in and reap some of the benefit in Jerusalem that those young people had blazed a trail many many years ago I got to come in and preach Jesus name baptism they were a trinitarian group but I got to come in and preach the Oneness of God in Jesus name baptism and I got to baptize people that they had won to the Lord I got to baptize them in the name of Jesus Christ come on now God is good he let me reap where I had not sown but some of the young people didn't last very long because they began to find everything wrong with Jerusalem and I want to tell you something I've lived there long enough and for enough periods of time 10 and a half weeks at one stent and more than one time I went for five weeks came home for two weeks and went back for another five weeks I wouldn't say that I you know that was my residence but it's I certainly felt connected to the city and I saw the bad you can get a parking ticket at the drop of a hat there doesn't have to be a sign there doesn't even have to be a law there just has to be a car I'm telling you the truth it's it's it's a joke anybody who's ever driven in Jerusalem knows that in fact most everybody carries cash to pay the tickets because they know and no need to argue the one thing you need to know you do not argue with the Jewish person you're going to lose you don't argue you just pay the ticket and some of the young people got very upset by that and it's dusty it's dusty there's a hum scene that blows in from the desert and sometimes the air is orange and sometimes in the early Spring's rain the early uh rains began to fall I was I was at a reception with the mayor of Jerusalem and some years ago felt very honored to be there and as I'm walking through the city Stacy was expecting uh Olivia at the time I think and they had to find a place to park close enough to get to where the reception so I said just let me out and I'll walk big mistake because I had on a spotless brand new crisp white shirt and I'm walking toward the reception with a tie on to meet the mayor and the spring rain begins and it didn't it didn't fall on me like water that wouldn't have been problem when that water filtered through that red air that desert dirt it dropped her I looked like an alabamian I had red spots all over my shirt and when it was my turn to talk to the mayor I apologized to him and he said oh no there's no need to apologize you stand before me wearing Jerusalem but some of those young people that went originally they got discouraged and they began to complain and they began to say oh that parking tickets and ah the weather in I don't like the food and Like Jesse he settled his Destiny last Sunday he definitely has to go to Jerusalem with us because he was complaining we went to a Greek Mediterranean restaurant and he was he said this most awful wasn't it you um this is your birthday whoopings right here he said this most awful food I've ever had in my life and I'm thinking this is the best food I've had in years this is delicious wonderful glorious food and he complain that's how some of those young people were doing and they got together in a prayer meeting and and sister Ruth was very discouraged about it she said I don't I can't make them lord I can't make them love the city I can't make them love it like I love it but she said Lord you give me such a love for Jerusalem that it's not that I'm ignorant to all the bad but I choose not to see the bad I choose to see the good and I choose to stand in her Gates like you told me to and sing your praises and the word of the Lord came through someone else in that service that prayer meeting that morning and the word of the Lord was this don't complain don't spend your time murmuring and complaining about the assignment that I have given to you only speak the good only speak the good about Jerusalem and I will give you an inheritance in this land now I tell you that would make you want to change your attitude come on so there are times that we are faced to choose not to see the bad we're not living in denial we see it's there but we choose not to focus on that because we recognize that as Joseph was squeezed into a moment of Destiny we are also being squeezed into a convergence point in our life and it can be costly it can be costly let me give you another verse and we'll move on I won't hold you too long now Romans chapter 8. verse 17 and 18. and if children then heirs this is who I am I'm an heir of God I'm join Ayers with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also is coming for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be what not to us if it said revealed to us it would probably be speaking about after death it didn't say the glory that will be revealed to us it said it's not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed will you just do this one one second some of you just make me happy in me the glory that is being revealed don't say will be one day is be is being revealed it is it's being revealed in me it's the promise it's the promise if I go through some tough stuff and I and I keep praising God and pushing through his glory can be revealed in my life that word glorified there means the condition of being bright thank you or Shining radiance a reflected Radiance that cannot be diminished God wants to fill us with a reflective Radiance that cannot be replenished we're not there yet but we're making our way if you believe that same man in the message proving his word give me 10 minutes in the message proving his word now remember that was not Jesus talking to Abraham there that could discern the thoughts in Sarah's mind behind him that was not Jesus he had not yet been born but it was a man in human flesh that Abraham called Elohim the great Almighty so you need to understand that was God in the body of a man it was it was definitely in morphe it was God in the body of a man but brother Branham is careful for us not to say that is Jesus because his name had not yet been given remember the Bible said there is a name above every name there's a name given and the name had not yet been given so we can't say this was Jesus that was talking uh to them in the tent Abraham and Sarah but this was God revealing himself in a body and Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom now watch close in the days of Sodom so will it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed not no more as a church see the bride is called see in that day the son of man will be revealed what to joined the church to the Head who's the head that's Jesus Christ to join the church not a prophet not a pastor not a Swami come on what what's the what's the guy that uh that's so revered that had to make an apology recently what's his name what do they call him say it again Dalai Lama um not the Dalai Lama to join the church to the Head Unite the marriage of the Bride bride to bridegroom isn't it let's go on the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together the church has to be the word I need to say that again that's not programs that's not Bible clubs that's not recovery classes all that may be fine needed in fact but the church has to be the word he is the word and the two guess what they unite together and to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man and we understand that God has done that not a clergyman he goes on to say you see what I mean see it's son of man Jesus Christ coming down in human flesh Among Us and will make his word so real that it'll unite the church and him as one the bride and then she'll go home to the wedding supper now talk about being glorified that's a powerful glorification isn't it she's already United so we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage of all we feel your flesh all the Flesh of Mighty Men he's talking about the verse in Revelation because the marriage of the Lamb has come but the Rapture is going to the wedding supper so remember when we leave here one of these days we're heading to the marriage supper she's already United see we go to the marriage to the wedding supper not to the marriage he said when the word here unites with the person and they too become one and then what does it do then it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians the son of man the word and the church become one whatever the son of man does he was the word I'll let you read the rest somebody said I don't know what my destiny is I don't know what all of it is but I know what part of it is it's to do the same thing just like it is spoken here now let me give you one more this is in the message questions and answers number two I have actually have two more and I'm going to give them and be done what are you what you are here get this in your mind now I'm going to close but what you are here is a sign that you are something else somewhere now let me help you with the language here because brother Branham often said things like this because you are an attribute of another dimension of another world quite often you are living out here a reflection of what you were there in his mind you've always wanted to be in Perfection you Christians there is a Perfection and that Perfection is not in this life let's go on but every man and woman here that is a Christian every person that is a Christian here now is already glorified there you see that's not what he said that's what he's pointing to every person that is a Christian here now is already glorified in the presence of Jesus Christ think of it and you've got another body whoo did you know it's not it's not that it has to be made for you it's already made for you did you know your next body is already created formed and ready and waiting on you did you know sometime when the presence of the Lord comes real in the house that body draws near oh yes he said that I didn't just pull that out of my ear he taught us that it draws near from that other from that other dimension it draws near and he's preaching away he said have you heard from your theophany because sometimes that next body gets pretty motivated and excited about the fact that you're you're going to live in that it's a reflection of who you are now but it's totally totally totally a body with no pain and no heartache and no sorrow and no rheumatism and no headaches and no handicaps but every man and woman here that is a Christian every person that is a Christian here now is already glorified in the presence of Jesus Christ and you've got another body you've got another body let's read on you won't have some other time you have right now right now there's another body waiting for you if this one should perish could you think of that study that just a minute so I want you to know something you don't have to worry about making your transition when that day comes that you're going to make a transition when we sing the song Swing Low Sweet Chariot we're not singing about a a vehicle with wheels that's not what's going to swing down and get you're not Elijah if you're waiting on horses of fire to pull you to Eternity that's not what the prophet taught us it's not the the chariot wheels and the horses of fire that's going to carry on you really could sing swing low might theophany Coming For To Carry Me Home because in that moment that this body should perish you have another body that swings right down out of that other dimension to pick up the real you and to take you into eternity oh let me tell you something death isn't real what in the already talking about death isn't real it's a bluff it's just a doorway you're just stepping into another dimension into another realm into another body the prophet taught us that our loved ones are not very far away from us you know I know that I want to know do you know that our loved ones are not very far from us even in this moment and sometimes they draw in because like the Angels they like to look on what God's doing in your life think about that they're cheering you on as a part of that great cloud of witnesses that no matter what comes in your life they're cheering you on don't give up don't give up keep pressing now my last one before we close it's from the Easter seal I like to call it the resurrection seal paragraph 105 I hope you can handle this and I'm done and God bless all you streamers I'm not giving up on I'm just closing the lid to remind myself to hush okay just a minute see here okay there's not any movement don't let me forget what I'm reading you won't mind if I take a minute God is good um Jesus let me just see if I can get an answer back thank you Father let's pray just a minute and uh right now they're not getting any movement and uh the thing is when you're when you're in the hospital then they don't go too that you go too long and they want to do a C-section so I'm just asking if they'll try the the mild suction first let's see if we can get an answer but until then let's pray just a minute father in the name of Jesus we have given this to you we have given Ashley to you we've given David to you Lord and we've given this beautiful little baby girl to you we thank you for the angels of the Lord that are with them in that room right now we thank you Lord that that like all of us in this room that precious little baby girl has a destiny book and every year and day of her life are already recorded in that book and before she was ever formed in her mother's belly you already knew her and you knew the circumstances of her birth and you knew the beginning of her life and you you knew the end of her life and you knew the in-between so we trust you today Lord we trust that you have a plan but Lord it is certainly certainly their desire and our desire that it would be the way they would want it to be so Lord if at all possible we would ask that you would allow her to give birth to that child even as she has desired but Lord we commit this into your hands we committed into your hands would you touch her now not only physically but emotionally spiritually would you whisper to her right now and bring peace to Ashley in the name of Jesus [Music] yes Lord yes Lord yes Lord yes Jesus yes Jesus there's nothing here to indicate that it's an emergency just the doctor's recommendation for the fact that there's no movement they're not able to to push her any closer to to life oh Jesus oh Jesus thank you I'll watch that and let me read this quotation to you McLeod musicians well that won't take long you you come hallelujah praise God praise God praise God Hallelujah Lord you told us it was done so we we believe it we believe your word oh they tried they tried to suction this is not a church this is a family so we just take care of our own right now she's ready to get it over with does anybody blame her now I got several texting at one time thank you oh sorry I know you deal with what I deal with some of you my age anyway words pop up there that you don't mean to put there I mean it you'll start topping something and it throws another word up there and sometimes it's not appropriate for the situation and you people that send me them voice text I've asked two or three folks don't send me any more of them without you edit them no emergency the baby's good that's a blessing all is good with the baby because I don't always have the gift of interpretation it comes and goes and so sometimes I can't interpret what people are saying I might fire into somebody and be and be answering something rebuking something that they didn't even say you say what you want to about this you'll never find another group like this we are unique 105 put it up there for me now but when they went up to Pentecost there they received the quickening power the power that made them alive and you need that quickening power it's part of the process of glorification now he said now there's where I think that you Presbyterian and Methodist Brethren you you do receive potentially On Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ but the abstract hasn't come yet that's the clearing of the deed oh thank God God gave Abraham a promise Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness but he sealed the Covenant by the Seal of circumcision and God gives you a promise potentially that you will receive it and you're going to be raised up this body is going to be glorified with him at the end of time but you see you have to get a clearance on that deed and the clearance is when everything against it every claim against it has been stricken off and you've got the abstract to it you've got the seal it's yours everything is on it it belongs to you amen how many of you have the faith to believe that and when we believe on Jesus Christ for our savior and repent and are baptized and come up to believe him God recognizes our repentance and our faith towards him and sins down the abstract the abstract is the Assurance it's the guarantee that everything was ever held against you if you thoroughly repented Hallelujah and the property is bought and you hold the abstract for the Assurance let somebody try to put you off the land say say he belongs you with the abstract in your hand let him try to do it there ain't a law and the land can do that because you hold the abstract how many of you understand the analogy that's being you there's no devil no church nor any theology that can overstep the boundaries of God's proof and Abstract that the baptism of the Holy Ghost has recognized Us in Jesus Christ we're just as sure to raise as he raised because potentially we have read it you believe it two paragraphs here to finish this one the old things what does it do to our mortal bodies it turns our opinion changes our Notions it sets our affections on things above on things which are above smoking drinking gambling the things that you used to do dead it's beneath you and you were quickened and this quickening power brings your body into a raptured condition already already that's part of the Pentecostal blessing notice the Pentecostal people up there when they got quickened by the Holy Spirit listen to me when those Pentecostal group up there on the day of Pentecost receive their abstract Deed from God sure it glorified their souls mind will and emotions they screamed they saw tongues of fire separated upon each of them and it so quickened their body redacts too it's there till they couldn't even speak in an Earthly language anymore interesting isn't it it quickened their body help me it quickened their body to a Heavenly language the place they're going to they started speaking Heaven's language while here on the Earth quickening power the quickening power of God shook their mortal body so till their entire mortal language was transfigured transformed into an immortal language what a quickening power what something that belongs I want you to know that's what the Holy Ghost comes to start in your life that quickening power starts that process of Glory that eternity rising up in you to change your mind and your will and your emotions and one of these days he sweeps down and changes this body if you believe that say Amen glory be to God let's stand come and let's Worship the Lord I love you Lord foreign

of us that live close and get our food I don't know how many times this week we considered canceling and postponing because so many would be gone and then babies coming and but I'm hungry I gotta eat somewhere and I hadn't slept so I might as well eat and but we'll have to go home and get it and bring it back so give us a few minutes we ask the Lord to do it with the weather like he wanted to do and he's drying up the rain we thank him for that they're going to do a C-section but at the end of that there's going to be a healthy baby that's what we believe God saw it it's in his hands we didn't see it for sure but he did and uh you know I know this is a plain talk we I can talk real playing with you about it but um there was a time that if a woman had a C-section that was it she had to have that every time but we're not living in that day no more or not thank God we're not as some of you know and it just it's disappointing to someone who has a plan and and has had the faith but God knows he knows so do what you can to love on them and by the time we come back and and eat I mean from afar right now would you love on them from afar but by the time we come back for lunch and we'll probably have an announcement a birth announcement I've been kind of you know how you get I mean 55 is not old by the way foreign that was sad is it is it sister West no I've had old sister

enough of my dreams thank God to make me want to keep dreaming on I've gotten up out of the bed many times at The Midnight Hour to pray a prayer that it seemed no answer would come though I'd waited patient and long but answers have come to enough of my prayers to make me want to keep praying on I've trusted many a friend that's failed me and left me to weep alone but I've found enough of those true blue friends to make me want to keep trusting on it seems that I've sowed many a seed that's Fallen by the way for the birds to feed upon but I've held enough golden sheaves of grain in my hand to make me keep sowing on seems that I've drained the cup of disappointment and pain and I've gone many a day without a song but I've sipped enough nectar from the Roses of life that makes me want to keep living on I don't regret my mom I've traveled sing it with me for the Lord and I don't regret the times I chose to trust in his holy word I have seen the years go by there have been many days
