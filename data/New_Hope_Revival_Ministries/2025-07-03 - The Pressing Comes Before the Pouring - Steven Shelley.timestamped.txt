[0:00] We're talking about the journey from the
[0:04] from the vineyard
[0:06] to the chalice
[0:09] of the king, the king's cup. There is a
[0:13] process to get the grape all the way
[0:18] through so that it ends up emptied,
[0:24] skin left behind. How many of you want
[0:27] to leave your old tough hide,
[0:32] tough skin, bad stuff? You you have
[0:36] hardened because of the circumstances of
[0:39] your life. And that hard skin keeps you
[0:43] from being pliable and moldable in the
[0:46] service of the Lord. So he wants you to
[0:48] leave that junk behind. And only the
[0:51] juice, that's the good part of who you
[0:53] are, goes on to the next step, the next
[0:55] step. And one day bless God in the new
[0:58] kingdom. You become and even now we
[1:02] become the a gift in his hand. We become
[1:04] a vessel in his hand. We become the wine
[1:07] that he drinks.
[1:10] Grapes are harvested in season. Never
[1:12] too early, never too late. You as a
[1:15] grape, you as fruit in his vintage must
[1:19] be harvested in season. You come in in
[1:23] the right hour, in the right moment when
[1:25] he calls you is perfect timing. If
[1:29] they're too early, they're bitter or
[1:30] sour. If they're too late, they've
[1:33] already started to rot or mold.
[1:36] Harvesting was often by hand because it
[1:40] is such a serious and careful affair
[1:43] with careful intention. Uh every
[1:46] believer also has a divine appointment
[1:50] in the timing. The truth reaches you in
[1:54] a moment that you are ready to receive
[1:56] it. And I want to tell you something. He
[1:59] became our example in the crushing.
[2:03] How do you know I have to be crushed?
[2:05] Because he was. Isaiah 53:5. But he was
[2:08] wounded
[2:10] for our transgressions.
[2:13] He was bruised for our iniquities. The
[2:16] chastisement of our peace was upon him.
[2:19] And with his thrift,
[2:22] we are healed.
[2:25] Oh, our example went before us. There is
[2:28] no glory
[2:30] without pressing.
[2:32] The press is painful, but it's where the
[2:36] wine begins. Hallelujah. Wine doesn't
[2:39] begin in the fermentation. It begins in
[2:42] the crushing. The press equals pressure,
[2:46] trials, betrayal, grief, loss,
[2:51] misunderstanding.
[2:53] The outer skin
[2:55] has to be broken
[2:58] of the breaking of that outer part of
[3:00] the soul life to release an inner
[3:04] character from the spirit. his spirit
[3:09] that has taken possession of a fallen
[3:12] human spirit and he has regenerated that
[3:16] spirit with his own life. It's not
[3:20] without you.
[3:22] It's within you. It has to be released.
[3:26] So there is a breaking of the outer part
[3:30] so that the sweetness and the reality of
[3:33] the inner part can come forth. Oh God, I
[3:37] thank you for it. Even Jesus pressed
[3:42] in Gethsemane, which the very word
[3:44] Gethsemane means olive press. So it
[3:47] shouldn't be a mystery to us that even
[3:50] our Lord struggled in the press in
[3:54] Gethsemane when he cried, "My spirit is
[3:59] willing.
[4:02] My flesh is weak." And he could have
[4:04] easily said, "My soul is hung in the
[4:06] middle." Because that's the reality. God
[4:09] knew what he was doing. He didn't curse
[4:11] you with mind, will, and emotions. He
[4:14] gifted you with mind, will, and emotion
[4:17] so that you could learn how to surrender
[4:19] mind, will, and emotions to his will.
