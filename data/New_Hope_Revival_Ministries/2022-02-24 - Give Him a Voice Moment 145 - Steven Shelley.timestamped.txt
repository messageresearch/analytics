[0:00] he wants to speak so directly to your
[0:02] heart
[0:03] [Music]
[0:09] the question this morning is do you have
[0:12] a personal experience with the lord
[0:15] jesus christ
[0:17] because when we stand in that great day
[0:19] before that great light we won't be
[0:22] facing anybody's record but our own
[0:26] it won't be our heritage or our
[0:28] inheritance or our pedigree it will be
[0:30] have you been born again by the spirit
[0:34] of jesus christ may each of you today
[0:37] have your own experience with the lord
[0:40] and carry that heritage forward and you
[0:44] know you got something to go to the
[0:45] enemy and more about you when when you
[0:48] know that that thing has traveled down
[0:50] through the generations you can stand
[0:52] here today and say i claim all of my
[0:55] grandma's prayers all my mom and daddy's
[0:58] prayers i claim the life that you gave
[1:02] them and bless them to live i claim all
[1:04] the benefits and blessings that they
[1:06] pray down upon their children and their
[1:08] grandchildren
[1:09] but you know there's other things we
[1:11] inherit from our forefathers
[1:14] sometimes those things can only be dealt
[1:17] with by the word of god
[1:19] and by the power of the holy spirit you
[1:21] may not feel him but he's here
[1:24] he wants to speak so directly to your
[1:26] heart if you'll surrender your heart and
[1:28] allow him to he wants to cut through all
[1:30] the stuff
[1:32] he wants to cut through all the
[1:34] marshmallow fluff he wants to get right
[1:36] down to the root of the matter because
[1:38] we're living in such a serious time now
[1:41] it's time to know you got to know you've
[1:44] got to know that you know that you know
[1:47] that you've had an experience with jesus
[1:50] christ what is it that causes somebody
[1:52] to do good for a while
[1:55] to hold on for a while to rejoice for a
[1:58] while to stay in the channel of god's
[2:00] spirit for a while and then all of a
[2:03] sudden fall away and fall away and fall
[2:05] away and keep repeating the pattern
[2:08] and you know there is no great answer
[2:10] for that
[2:11] there's no perfect answer for that but i
[2:14] think if we had to boil it down it
[2:16] depends on which voice are you listening
[2:19] to this morning when we take god's word
[2:22] and we live a life of surrender to that
[2:24] word and we begin to speak forth that
[2:26] word that all of heaven begins to move
[2:30] in all directions to bring that word to
[2:33] pass
[2:35] not only do we not necessarily need a
[2:37] prayer line but god has given us the
[2:39] grace and the ability to be able to
[2:41] speak our own victory to be able to
[2:44] speak our own deliverance because when
[2:46] god fills your belly with rivers of
[2:48] living water he'll laugh out of you
[2:51] he'll express joy out of you if you give
[2:55] him a voice
[2:58] you've got to yield your mouth
[3:01] you've got to yield your tongue
[3:03] you've got to yield your voice
[3:05] because joy has a voice
[3:09] you've got to yield yourself as an
[3:11] instrument
