[1:08:22] with me
[1:08:23] whatsoever he
[1:08:26] saith uh that is creative power in your
[1:08:31] mouth but it's important for you to

[1:08:40] all of your heart amen and then verse
[1:08:44] 24 therefore I say unto you what things
[1:08:49] soever ye desire When you pray believe
[1:08:54] that you receive receive
[1:08:56] them and
[1:08:58] ye
[1:09:00] shall have
[1:09:03] them now the believe brother brandham
[1:09:06] tells us is present tense the shall
[1:09:10] let's see that verse again the shall is
[1:09:13] sometimes a future
[1:09:16] tense but it's
[1:09:18] sure in other words he may not come when
[1:09:21] you want him but he's right on time is
[1:09:25] there anybody in here that can testify
[1:09:27] tonight that Jesus keeps all of his
[1:09:31] appointments and if we believe in our
[1:09:33] heart then what comes out of our mouth
[1:09:36] we can hold in our hand We Believe now
[1:09:40] we speak now and we
[1:09:44] expect that now or in the future God
[1:09:48] will perform the word that he has
[1:09:51] promised if you believe that I want you
[1:09:53] to shout amen amen may God add his
[1:09:56] Blessing to the reading of his word you
[1:09:58] may be seated I want to minister tonight
[1:10:01] and again in the morning on receiving a
[1:10:05] Divine promise from God and I want to
[1:10:09] subtitle it this evening watch the order
[1:10:13] of the
[1:10:14] word now there's a whole lot of talk
[1:10:17] around the message of the hour
[1:10:19] concerning Church order and let me just
[1:10:22] answer your question concerning Church
[1:10:24] order every church is Sovereign that
[1:10:28] answers that let every Pastor let every
[1:10:31] leadership seek the Lord and know the
[1:10:34] mind of God for how the church service
[1:10:38] should be conducted no two churches have
[1:10:41] to be
[1:10:42] alike you may not like the song I sing I
[1:10:45] may not like the song you sing but we're
[1:10:48] singing it unto the Lord there are some
[1:10:51] Churches who believe that if you sing a
[1:10:53] song that's not 50 years old than it
[1:10:56] couldn't possibly line up with the word
[1:10:58] well we know better than that because we
[1:11:01] know that even the spirit of God can
[1:11:03] drop on us and someone can sing Under
[1:11:06] inspiration a song that's never been
[1:11:09] written before what the New Testament
[1:11:11] calls a spiritual song and so we we've
[1:11:15] got to be careful when we're when we're
[1:11:17] trying to put our uh preference on
[1:11:21] somebody else amen and so down through
[1:11:24] the years it has been that way that
[1:11:27] folks have come and said well we don't
[1:11:29] believe in Drums well don't have any
[1:11:31] drums in your church and I'll support
[1:11:33] you right now if you do if you believe
[1:11:37] it's all right well then fine then
[1:11:39] somebody said well they get a little
[1:11:40] carried away well you know it's hard
[1:11:43] when the anointing
[1:11:44] Falls it's hard not to use your gift
[1:11:47] with all your might so we know a little
[1:11:50] bit about church order but tonight I
[1:11:52] want to talk a little bit as a subtitle
[1:11:55] about about the order of the word
[1:11:58] receiving a Divine promise from God
[1:12:02] watching the order of the word God never
[1:12:06] breaks his order in his word if he ever
[1:12:10] did it one way one time he's able to do
[1:12:13] it again just like he did it the time
[1:12:16] before you believe that don't you now
[1:12:19] everything that God can do is not
[1:12:21] written in the word we know that because
[1:12:24] the Bible says we mentioned the other
[1:12:27] night that if everything Jesus did in
[1:12:30] his three and a half years of Earthly
[1:12:32] Ministry if it were all recorded in
[1:12:34] books the whole universe could not
[1:12:37] contain the books that would be written
[1:12:40] about his works on the earth and so
[1:12:44] there are some things that are not
[1:12:46] recorded but here's what we must
[1:12:48] remember God will never move against his
[1:12:51] word I don't care what you dream what
[1:12:54] you hear what you think what you believe
[1:12:57] if it doesn't line up with the word of
[1:12:59] God we're obligated as Believers to
[1:13:02] leave it alone now I don't know if
[1:13:05] there's anybody in here tonight that has
[1:13:07] a need to receive a promise from God in
[1:13:11] in manifestation or sometimes brother
[1:13:13] brandham said
[1:13:15] materialization when it
[1:13:17] materializes it's good to have a promise
[1:13:20] isn't it it's good to tote it around in
[1:13:22] the fly leaf of your Bible it's good to
[1:13:25] remember it and testify about it and
[1:13:27] talk about it but how many of you know
[1:13:30] that we're coming to an hour where we
[1:13:31] need to see that promise become a
[1:13:34] reality come to fruition in our life you
[1:13:38] can't really fight the devil with just a
[1:13:41] promise but as God begins to perform
[1:13:44] that promise in your life and it begins
[1:13:46] to materialize before your eyes it
[1:13:49] boosts your faith and you begin to go
[1:13:51] back and think about all the other
[1:13:53] things that God has said he wanted to do
[1:13:55] in our lives there's a huge Destiny for
[1:13:57] the New Testament Church there's still a
[1:14:00] huge Destiny for the Bride of Jesus
[1:14:02] Christ if you believe it say amen and so
[1:14:05] it's not over yet I want you to tell
[1:14:07] somebody it's not over
[1:14:10] yet God's still moving and he's not
[1:14:13] decreasing and whimpering away he's
[1:14:16] increasing in power and might according
[1:14:19] to our faith if we can only believe if
[1:14:24] we can only
[1:14:27] believe did you come to help the word
[1:14:29] help me preach the word tonight all
[1:14:31] right good I'm waiting on you in a
[1:14:33] message called spiritual food in due
[1:14:36] season just as a little way of of
[1:14:39] introducing the subject tonight I want
[1:14:41] to read paragraph 157 now he told us if
[1:14:46] thou can't believe if you can say to
[1:14:50] this mountain be moved and don't doubt
[1:14:54] it in your heart but believe that what
[1:14:58] you've said will come to pass you can
[1:15:02] have it well that's just what we read in
[1:15:04] the word isn't it so we've got to say
[1:15:06] Amen to that he said when you pray
[1:15:09] believe that you receive it it'll be
[1:15:14] given to you what a promise can anybody
[1:15:19] thank God for that promise and then
[1:15:23] let's grab in we have found him come and
[1:15:26] see I want to pick up two paragraphs for
[1:15:30] you there just to kind of set the scene
[1:15:32] here paragraph 21 he said then he's here
[1:15:37] is that right he said wherever two or
[1:15:40] three are gathered no matter how small a
[1:15:44] group two or three I'll be in their
[1:15:48] midst haven't you seen God show up when
[1:15:52] there was just a handful of people and
[1:15:55] prayer meeting where there was less than
[1:15:56] a dozen and God showed up so real he
[1:15:59] doesn't have to have a crowd to move he
[1:16:02] moves according to our faith there's
[1:16:05] enough faith in this room right now to
[1:16:08] create a world out there
[1:16:10] somewhere we've just got to learn how to
[1:16:12] use that faith and we've got to learn
[1:16:15] how to position ourselves to receive a
[1:16:18] Divine promise from God in
[1:16:21] manifestation and we're going to get
[1:16:23] somewhere with this tonight he he said
[1:16:25] I'll be in their midst what anything
[1:16:27] they ask shall receive it now he said
[1:16:30] that's either right or it's wrong that's
[1:16:33] either the word or it's not the word he
[1:16:36] said Jesus said if ye abide in me and my
[1:16:39] word in you you can ask what you will
[1:16:45] it'll be done I'm going to put the be
[1:16:48] there it'll done to you it'll be done to
[1:16:51] you because that's what the word said
[1:16:53] now anybody in here need
[1:16:55] a manifestation of a promise in your
[1:16:57] life I want to make sure that this is
[1:16:59] the right message for the right time I
[1:17:01] believe it is but I don't want to preach
[1:17:04] a whole message and and it not apply to
[1:17:06] anybody so if you're here and you
[1:17:09] believe God has given you a promise and
[1:17:11] you've not yet seen that promise in
[1:17:14] manifestation and you'd like to you
[1:17:16] believe the season is Drawing Near maybe
[1:17:19] it's the salvation of your loved ones
[1:17:21] maybe it's getting rid of that nagging
[1:17:23] root symptom in your body so that you
[1:17:26] can be totally made whole maybe it's
[1:17:29] seeing your grandchildren baptized with
[1:17:32] the Holy Ghost is there anybody that's
[1:17:34] got a promise like that and you would
[1:17:36] like to begin to see that
[1:17:38] manifest okay all right I think there's
[1:17:41] enough of you that ought to be able to
[1:17:42] to get a hold of this then whatsoever
[1:17:45] things you desire When you pray believe
[1:17:48] believe believe you
[1:17:50] receive very simple believe it and you
[1:17:54] receive it he said but watch the order
[1:17:59] of the word now now we're talking about
[1:18:03] receiving a Divine promise from God now
[1:18:05] we're talking about watching the order
[1:18:08] of the word God's not going to break the
[1:18:11] order of the
[1:18:13] word it's not going to fall on your head
[1:18:16] like ripe cherries from a tree all right
[1:18:19] you're not just going to come up with
[1:18:21] some kind of uh you know desire
[1:18:23] something out there Something In the
[1:18:25] Flesh even a solish ambition and you
[1:18:28] just start declaring that all over town
[1:18:31] that doesn't have to come to pass you
[1:18:33] may never get that if you want to see
[1:18:36] the manifestation of your Divine promise
[1:18:40] then we've got to watch the order of the
[1:18:43] word and when we watch the order of the
[1:18:46] word we'll see how it is to come to pass
[1:18:49] in our life and here it is he said you
[1:18:52] believe now you receive receive it it
[1:18:56] shall be given to you tonight see he
[1:19:00] can't do nothing for
[1:19:03] you I'm going to let that sink in I'm
[1:19:06] going to take my time and let you hear
[1:19:09] it well tonight yes sir you can't he
[1:19:13] can't he can't do nothing for you until
[1:19:18] first
[1:19:20] you believe it
[1:19:25] and
[1:19:26] say believe it and say let's say that
[1:19:31] again believe it and say he can't do
[1:19:35] nothing for you he can't do anything for
[1:19:39] you until first you believe it and say
[1:19:46] yeah now what are we supposed to say he
[1:19:50] has done
[1:19:52] it now I want you to declare that into
[1:19:55] the promise that you're waiting to come
[1:19:57] to fruition and manifestation in your
[1:19:59] life I want you to think about the
[1:20:01] Deliverance of your loved ones I want
[1:20:04] you to think about what is the thing
[1:20:06] that you mentioned the first first above
[1:20:09] all when you pray what is the first
[1:20:12] thing what's the biggest thing that
[1:20:14] you're holding on to God to bring to
[1:20:17] pass in your life then if you want to
[1:20:19] see the fruition of that you're going to
[1:20:22] have to watch the order of the word he
[1:20:26] can't do anything for you until first
[1:20:29] you believe it and say he has done it
[1:20:36] Hallelujah and so this doesn't just run
[1:20:38] through our mind and we let it go he
[1:20:41] says to us let me let that soak
[1:20:47] real deep yeah now that sounds like
[1:20:51] Faith 101 Christianity 10 101 but
[1:20:56] brother brandom is preaching to a mixed
[1:20:59] multitude maybe I'm preaching to a mixed
[1:21:02] multitude tonight as it goes out over
[1:21:05] the stream to the nations of the world
[1:21:09] maybe there are some who are not quite
[1:21:11] familiar with the concept of watching
[1:21:14] the order of the word he can't do
[1:21:17] anything for you until first you believe
[1:21:20] it and then you must say that he has
[1:21:24] done it it's the prophetic power of a
[1:21:28] testimony it's the prophetic power of a
[1:21:32] confession somebody say I've got to
[1:21:35] confess it I've got to speak it I've got
[1:21:39] to say it and I've got to believe it now
[1:21:43] he gets really plain as we go along but
[1:21:45] we want to let this soak in real deep
[1:21:49] the next paragraph he said how many
[1:21:51] correctly understands that no matter how
[1:21:54] SI you are what about it you've got to
[1:21:57] First believe he does it do you believe
[1:22:01] he's a Healer do you believe he's still
[1:22:04] a Healer do you believe that nothing is
[1:22:06] impossible with him you've got to First
[1:22:10] believe he does it and then
[1:22:13] confess not that he will do it not that
[1:22:17] he can do it we usually say Lord I
[1:22:20] believe we pray our prayer and then we
[1:22:22] say Lord I believe you can do this
[1:22:24] that's not the order of the word the
[1:22:26] order of the word is not to thank him
[1:22:29] that he can do it it is to declare that
[1:22:32] he has done it that is a past statement
[1:22:36] here he has done it remember the prophet
[1:22:41] told us that that if Jesus were standing
[1:22:44] in the midst of us tonight even walking
[1:22:46] down the aisle he couldn't do anything
[1:22:48] for us
[1:22:51] tonight that he hasn't already done
[1:22:54] he's
[1:22:56] already done it he's already done it you
[1:23:01] may wonder why I'm so worked up about
[1:23:04] this well God's been dealing with my
[1:23:06] heart I I I I hear that there should be
[1:23:10] no more delay in the hour of the
[1:23:13] sounding of the seventh Angel's message
[1:23:16] there should be no more delay in King
[1:23:19] James it says time shall be no more but
[1:23:22] in the original it it SE says there
[1:23:26] should be no more delay is anybody with
[1:23:29] me is anybody tired of
[1:23:33] delay has anybody got some hope deferred
[1:23:36] hanging on in your life because you've
[1:23:38] been waiting and you've been waiting and
[1:23:39] you've been waiting and you've been
[1:23:41] waiting and you've been waiting now
[1:23:43] we've got to excuse me we've got to
[1:23:46] watch the order of the word first we've
[1:23:50] got to believe it and then we've got to
[1:23:52] confess not that he can if he wants to
[1:23:56] or that he's able to but that he has
[1:23:59] done
[1:24:02] it you know I taught you years ago that
[1:24:05] we pray the wrong prayer Lord save my
[1:24:08] loved
[1:24:09] ones that's not the order of the word
[1:24:13] that's
[1:24:14] religion that's denominational talk Lord
[1:24:18] please save my loved ones if you're
[1:24:20] praying that way you're asking him to do
[1:24:23] something that he's already already made
[1:24:24] atonement for if brother Isaiah Brooks
[1:24:27] was here he'd Cut Loose into that song
[1:24:30] what more can he do what more can he do
[1:24:34] he's laid a foundation he's opened up
[1:24:37] the way what more can he do he bled what
[1:24:42] more what more can he do and so we're
[1:24:45] not asking God to save him rather we're
[1:24:48] asking the Lord to bring them to a place
[1:24:51] where they see their need of him
[1:24:55] and then they've got to follow the order
[1:24:56] of the
[1:24:57] word there's no escaping the order of
[1:25:00] the word they've got to follow the same
[1:25:02] order of the word you do they've got to
[1:25:03] believe it and then they've got to
[1:25:06] confess that he has done it I've told
[1:25:09] you before my grandmother standing over
[1:25:11] the the the body of my grandfather Kos
[1:25:15] now for hours a massive aneurism has
[1:25:19] happened in his brain and the blood has
[1:25:22] surged loose through through his body
[1:25:25] and one by one we began to watch as his
[1:25:30] toes began to die and the circulation in
[1:25:33] his leg began to to pass and we watched
[1:25:36] it becoming black and and they told us
[1:25:39] this is the this is the way he's going
[1:25:41] to die and then when that blood backs up
[1:25:44] into his organs it's going to start it's
[1:25:46] going to start shutting those organs
[1:25:48] down and this seemed like an awful
[1:25:50] terrible drawn out process to us my
[1:25:54] grandmother and I neither one were sure
[1:25:56] that my grandfather was ready to meet
[1:25:58] the Lord and the doctor said he will not
[1:26:01] wake up that that that ship has sailed
[1:26:05] if you're expecting to say goodbye you
[1:26:07] say it he can likely hear you but he
[1:26:10] will not be able to respond well you
[1:26:13] just don't tell people to Faith
[1:26:15] that my granny said honey come up here
[1:26:18] to this bedside let you and I agree in
[1:26:21] the name of Jesus that God will wake him
[1:26:24] out out of that K sleep and give us an
[1:26:27] opportunity to have peace that he has
[1:26:30] made everything right with the Lord so
[1:26:31] we just ask God to do it just according
[1:26:34] to our faith and then we called it done
[1:26:36] and and I said Papa wake up
[1:26:40] yeah and you know what it shocked us
[1:26:43] here we are
[1:26:46] praying I'm not the only one praying
[1:26:49] believing confessing you know claiming
[1:26:53] singing all of things you do to get the
[1:26:55] spirit of God around you and and then he
[1:26:58] sits straight up in the bed setting off
[1:27:01] alarms all the way down the hall nurses
[1:27:04] come running he opened his eyes he
[1:27:06] looked right at my grandmother she said
[1:27:09] honey do you know you're saved do you
[1:27:12] know that the Lord has forgiven you of
[1:27:14] all of your sins he looked her right in
[1:27:17] the eye and he said hope so I hope so
[1:27:20] she said no no no no not hope so you've
[1:27:25] got to know so we begin to pray he began
[1:27:28] to call out to the Lord for mercy and
[1:27:31] the nurses that had just made it back to
[1:27:33] the to the nurses station here they come
[1:27:35] running again because they heard his
[1:27:38] voice screaming out Lord have mercy on
[1:27:42] me and save
[1:27:44] me when we knew that he had called on
[1:27:48] the Lord he he closed his eyes he he
[1:27:53] laid back down in the bed he never moved
[1:27:56] another uh not even another twitch until
[1:27:59] the Lord called him home but we had
[1:28:02] peace my granny taught me something in
[1:28:05] that moment we can't have a hope so
[1:28:07] faith that we're going to see the
[1:28:09] manifestation of a Divine promise come
[1:28:12] on we've got to have a no so Faith you
[1:28:15] can't hope you're saved you've got to
[1:28:17] know you're saved you can't hope you
[1:28:19] have the Holy Ghost you've got to know
[1:28:22] you've received the bap baptism of the
[1:28:25] Holy Ghost in fire you can't hope that
[1:28:27] he's a
[1:28:28] Healer and then pray some little prayer
[1:28:31] that you don't believe you've got to
[1:28:33] follow the order of the word you've got
[1:28:36] to accept that he's a Healer and believe
[1:28:38] it that's the A and the B except believ
[1:28:42] in what was the C
[1:28:45] confess confess can you believe that no
[1:28:48] I didn't fall I'm
[1:28:51] okay did not fall all is well just
[1:28:54] getting a little
[1:28:55] excited there something to get excited
[1:28:58] about we've got a lot a lot of potential
[1:29:02] we can see God do anything we need to
[1:29:05] see him do if we can get the order of
[1:29:07] the word right believe it then confess
[1:29:10] not that he can not that he will but
[1:29:13] that he has done it it's finished how
[1:29:17] many of you believe calvary's work is
[1:29:19] finished then he said then confess that
[1:29:22] he has done it be before listen before
[1:29:26] he can even go to work on
[1:29:29] it did you know he might not have even
[1:29:32] started working on your
[1:29:37] promise did you know your promise may be
[1:29:40] just hanging around him like it's
[1:29:42] hanging around you I'll show you
[1:29:43] something else he said in a minute
[1:29:45] that'll that'll verify
[1:29:47] that he may not have even started
[1:29:49] working on the materialization of the
[1:29:52] promise the work that's needed to finish
[1:29:56] the promise is done but he may not have
[1:29:59] even started moving things around to
[1:30:01] help you position to receive the promise
[1:30:03] because you haven't taken the time to
[1:30:06] believe and confess that he has done it
[1:30:10] Lord I Thank you that every one of my
[1:30:12] children are are saved Sanctified and
[1:30:15] filled with the Holy Ghost Lord I Thank
[1:30:17] you that every one of my children are
[1:30:19] going to stand in the middle of their
[1:30:21] Destiny in the end time and not devil or
[1:30:24] demon can come and hinder them from
[1:30:27] doing what God has called them to do
[1:30:29] because Lord you've already done the
[1:30:31] work in them come on no symptom or
[1:30:34] rooted cause in my body can stand
[1:30:37] because youve already healed me from
[1:30:39] before the foundation of the world the
[1:30:42] same atonement that redeemed me heal me
[1:30:46] and I am confessing tonight without
[1:30:49] doubt that I am
[1:30:51] healed brother brandom said you've got
[1:30:53] to believe believe it and then confess
[1:30:55] that he has done it before he can go
[1:30:57] even go to work on
[1:30:59] it what what if you're waiting on
[1:31:04] God and God's waiting on
[1:31:11] you what if your confessions
[1:31:17] wrong if God were to open the windows of
[1:31:20] heaven and let me tell you something
[1:31:24] some years ago some of us would have
[1:31:26] thought it
[1:31:28] impossible to pay off the debt on this
[1:31:33] property without bleeding
[1:31:36] people you'd have thought if we would
[1:31:38] have done that nobody would have had
[1:31:39] enough left to buy their groceries or
[1:31:41] pay their
[1:31:42] bills but let me tell you something when
[1:31:45] we began to hear brother God used
[1:31:47] brother gy and when we begin to hear
[1:31:49] really it's already done sister Flo been
[1:31:53] saying it for years it's already done
[1:31:55] she said brother Shelly I wish you'd
[1:31:57] just put a box back here at the door and
[1:32:00] and and and just let us believe God to
[1:32:03] pay all the debt off for this property
[1:32:05] she said because I believe it's already
[1:32:07] done
[1:32:09] yeah and our mind says well you know
[1:32:12] it'll take a a Month of Sundays for God
[1:32:14] to do it $10 at a
[1:32:18] time do you do you wonder if maybe we
[1:32:21] could have seen things moving a whole
[1:32:23] lot faster Pastor if if enough of us
[1:32:26] would have gotten the order of the
[1:32:29] word now we stand on the other side of
[1:32:32] that debt and we're building a
[1:32:35] fellowship hall down there without a
[1:32:37] loan and you're going to go down it's
[1:32:40] not fancy yet but I want you to know
[1:32:42] it's a
[1:32:46] promise before it got closed in birds
[1:32:49] are flying around your head and mud
[1:32:52] tracked and bird dropping and you stand
[1:32:55] there and you think this will never
[1:32:57] amount to anything but I want you to
[1:33:00] know that you've got to realize that
[1:33:02] there's a promise that's beginning to
[1:33:05] manifest materialized before your eyes
[1:33:09] because somebody believed it and
[1:33:12] somebody confessed that the work was
[1:33:14] already done and somebody put their hand
[1:33:18] of the
[1:33:19] plow to see it begin to come to pass
[1:33:23] come on
[1:33:24] that's the order of the word first you
[1:33:26] believe it then confess that he has done
[1:33:28] it before he can even go to work on it
[1:33:31] and brother bom says how many knows that
[1:33:33] I don't think many people really
[1:33:35] realize that God may not be even working
[1:33:37] on your promise just
[1:33:40] yet because you've failed to see the
[1:33:43] order of the word you accept it and then
[1:33:46] call it done
[1:33:48] done take the ining off of your
[1:33:52] faith take the future off of your faith
[1:33:55] and say what the word says it's
[1:33:58] done every promise in the book is
[1:34:02] mine it's
[1:34:04] done believe it accept it believe it
[1:34:07] confess it he goes
[1:34:10] on are you still with me when you come
[1:34:13] to the altar to pray to be forgiven for
[1:34:15] your sins this is so good it isn't cause
[1:34:19] you
[1:34:20] cry it isn't because you confess
[1:34:27] it's because you
[1:34:30] believe it sounds too simple doesn't it
[1:34:33] but this is the believer's
[1:34:36] inheritance this is Bridal
[1:34:39] inheritance it's not our crying it's not
[1:34:42] even our pray our long petitions of
[1:34:47] telling God how to do
[1:34:51] it sometimes he prob wants to say stay
[1:34:54] out of my
[1:34:56] business just believe that I'm going to
[1:34:58] do it and call it done and then brother
[1:35:01] Bram said then we go to praising
[1:35:03] him and we give him Advanced praise I
[1:35:06] want you to know there's power in
[1:35:09] advanced
[1:35:11] praise I'll show you what he said in
[1:35:13] just a minute Mary didn't wait on her
[1:35:15] belly to
[1:35:17] swell she didn't wait on a physical
[1:35:19] manifestation that the promise was on
[1:35:22] the way as soon as she heard the word
[1:35:25] she believed the word and said let it be
[1:35:28] done in
[1:35:29] me then she began to praise the Lord
[1:35:32] then she began to rejoice and give God
[1:35:35] praise not because he was going to do it
[1:35:37] but because he he had done it he had
[1:35:41] done it let's go on and when you believe
[1:35:45] stand up
[1:35:46] [Music]
[1:35:50] uhoh and testify
[1:35:55] the prophetic
[1:35:56] power of a
[1:35:59] testimony some of us can't testify
[1:36:02] because we think we have to preach when
[1:36:04] we get up or we think we've got to tie
[1:36:07] all the tiny puzzle pieces together so
[1:36:12] that somebody knows the
[1:36:15] backstory when somebody says to me I've
[1:36:17] got to go to the
[1:36:19] backstory I know I'm going to be there a
[1:36:21] while that's not the kind of the
[1:36:23] testimony he's talking about here that
[1:36:26] has its place and haven't we been
[1:36:28] encouraged on Tuesday nights when we
[1:36:30] have taken some testimonies because the
[1:36:33] enemy will tell you nothing's going on
[1:36:35] in the body and then all of a sudden
[1:36:38] people begin to get
[1:36:39] up uh no I I can't take a phone
[1:36:45] call although it is a preacher that I
[1:36:48] haven't heard from in many many years
[1:36:50] should I just take it
[1:37:00] he may have something to say to
[1:37:02] us it's not your life story he's talking
[1:37:06] about we need that sometime he's talking
[1:37:10] about believing what the word has said
[1:37:14] calling it done and then telling
[1:37:17] somebody before the enemy can move in on
[1:37:19] your faith now here's what the the the
[1:37:22] mind says you know know the human mind
[1:37:24] says well now you better not testify
[1:37:26] that you're
[1:37:28] healed because somebody will see you
[1:37:31] limping and they'll they'll know you're
[1:37:33] not healed and that will bring a
[1:37:36] reproach on the Lord and people will
[1:37:39] think that he doesn't heal has he has he
[1:37:41] not whispered something stupid like that
[1:37:43] to you hasn't he told you something like
[1:37:46] that well I would
[1:37:47] testify uh I have to be honest I have to
[1:37:50] be honest my son gave a testimony
[1:37:53] concerning insurance and the baby coming
[1:37:55] and all that and and when he made that
[1:37:57] confession something in my natural mind
[1:38:00] not my not my faith not my faith but
[1:38:04] something in my natural mind said
[1:38:07] oh what if it don't turn out quite like
[1:38:10] that I caught it I recognized that
[1:38:14] wasn't me that wasn't my faith that
[1:38:16] wasn't standing in agreement with his
[1:38:20] faith and I had to make the confession
[1:38:22] that he's telling us to make tonight I
[1:38:24] had to say it is
[1:38:27] done it is done you know I I spent 10
[1:38:31] years of my life traveling around the
[1:38:34] country some overseas presenting the
[1:38:37] ministry of brother brandom and the
[1:38:39] message of the hour to Pentecostal and
[1:38:41] charismatic people I hope I taught them
[1:38:43] something they actually taught me a few
[1:38:46] things right they taught me that you
[1:38:48] don't have to wait until the fullness of
[1:38:51] the answer has come to begin to to give
[1:38:54] God
[1:38:55] praise they said if it only comes like a
[1:38:57] little tingle if it only and I don't
[1:38:59] mean we do this by feeling no no no no
[1:39:02] we don't do this by feeling that's not
[1:39:04] what I learned but what I learned was
[1:39:07] even if it's in its embryonic stage if
[1:39:10] God if you just begin to see a little I
[1:39:12] feel a little better well my my blood
[1:39:14] pressure is lower than it
[1:39:16] was that's when you jump up and start
[1:39:19] giving God High Praise
[1:39:23] that's the kind of warfare praise we're
[1:39:25] talking about you just start giving him
[1:39:27] praise that it's done and and one one
[1:39:30] man said well I have no feeling in my
[1:39:33] hand and he went up for prayer and there
[1:39:36] was a little tingle running down one of
[1:39:39] his fingers and he hadn't felt that in
[1:39:41] many many many years he stood up his
[1:39:44] wife pulled him down what are you about
[1:39:46] to do he said I'm going to testify that
[1:39:48] I'm Healed she said how do you know
[1:39:49] you're healed he said well the word said
[1:39:51] I'm Healed but I feel a little tingle in
[1:39:53] my finger she said you are not going to
[1:39:55] stand up and tell this crowd that you
[1:39:57] know your whole hand and arm has uh is
[1:40:00] healed and that it's not paralyzed
[1:40:02] anymore and numb anymore because you
[1:40:05] felt A tingle in your hand he said watch
[1:40:12] me watch me he said I want to thank the
[1:40:15] Lord for healing me my arm and hand was
[1:40:18] paralyzed and numb and I had no feeling
[1:40:20] in it and he said tonight when I was
[1:40:22] prayed for my finger begin to
[1:40:26] tingle do you know that meeting was over
[1:40:28] and some Weeks Later the testimony came
[1:40:30] by email that God had finished that
[1:40:34] work and I said you know I know his wife
[1:40:37] don't think that finger tingling is all
[1:40:39] that silly
[1:40:40] anymore God gave him that as a little
[1:40:44] token we wait sometime too
[1:40:47] long well I need this confirmed by three
[1:40:50] witnesses that I'm Healed you do
[1:40:54] well I need to wait at least three weeks
[1:40:56] to see if the symptoms return church
[1:40:59] that is not the order of the
[1:41:02] word we've got to learn to testify of
[1:41:06] what he has done and praise him for what
[1:41:09] he has done even though we may not see
[1:41:12] the manifestation of the fullness of the
[1:41:15] promise yet if you're with me I want to
[1:41:18] hear
[1:41:18] [Music]
[1:41:20] you it's important
[1:41:23] it's important he goes on it's not
[1:41:26] because you
[1:41:28] confess it isn't because you confess or
[1:41:32] cry it's because you
[1:41:35] believe when you come to the altar all
[1:41:37] right and when you believe and stand up
[1:41:39] and testify now watch you go outside
[1:41:42] after you accepted Christ the old crowd
[1:41:45] says you're no
[1:41:47] different there's nothing different but
[1:41:49] you believe you're
[1:41:51] different well if you go say no I guess
[1:41:53] I didn't get anything I didn't get it
[1:41:57] well you just got another trip to the
[1:42:00] altar
[1:42:01] coming you've got to understand that
[1:42:03] everybody's not going to celebrate your
[1:42:05] Victory somebody's going to ask you how
[1:42:07] do you know you're healed if somebody in
[1:42:11] this church ask you how do you know
[1:42:15] you're
[1:42:17] healed then that somebody needs another
[1:42:21] trip to the altar are you in agreement
[1:42:24] with me don't ask anybody in this house
[1:42:28] how they know they know because the word
[1:42:31] said so and they're going to testify
[1:42:34] that they're healed whether or not they
[1:42:36] see the full materialization of it or
[1:42:38] not we're going to celebrate with them
[1:42:41] if all they have is a tingle in their
[1:42:44] finger because we're going to believe
[1:42:46] that what God
[1:42:49] started he's more than able to finish
[1:42:53] he's not just the author of your faith
[1:42:55] but he's the finisher of your faith

[1:43:22] in the message Jesus Christ Christ the
[1:43:23] same yesterday today and forever and we

[1:43:31] there our love this message was preached
[1:43:34] in
[1:43:37] Alberta verse uh paragraph 20 he said if
[1:43:40] John D
[1:43:41] Rockefeller would offer me a check
[1:43:44] tonight to build a new church for a
[1:43:46] million
[1:43:47] dollars I wouldn't be afraid to fill it
[1:43:49] out no sir because I believe John D
[1:43:55] rockefeller's worth
[1:43:58] it if I wrote you for a check if I wrote
[1:44:02] a check for you for a million
[1:44:05] dollars I'll tell you right now it's not
[1:44:07] it's not drafted on any of my accounts
[1:44:10] it's Faith it'd be faith if I did
[1:44:14] it I wouldn't believe me
[1:44:17] either but brother brandom said if John
[1:44:19] D Rockefeller offered you a check for
[1:44:21] minut he said I wouldn't be afraid to
[1:44:23] fill it out no sir because I believe
[1:44:25] John D rockefeller's worth it and if
[1:44:28] Jesus Christ
[1:44:30] uhoh we're getting somewhere now if
[1:44:34] Jesus Christ offered me a check tonight
[1:44:36] for my sickness that he healed me at
[1:44:39] calary I'm not afraid to fill it out and
[1:44:42] hand it in there go
[1:44:45] testifying that God has healed
[1:44:49] me because I know that the one that the
[1:44:53] check is drawn on can back it up now
[1:44:57] that's where we are tonight that's where
[1:44:59] we are tonight he said no matter what
[1:45:02] the results is I believe Jesus told the
[1:45:05] truth see that's where it comes from
[1:45:08] it's what you
[1:45:10] believe it's what you
[1:45:12] believe it's what you believe your
[1:45:15] attitude
[1:45:23] I want to see
[1:45:26] you your attitude towards
[1:45:31] Jesus no wonder some people don't speak
[1:45:35] Faith they don't trust that the check is
[1:45:37] any
[1:45:39] good you've got to believe that it's
[1:45:41] good you've got to believe that he's the
[1:45:43] same yesterday and today and forever
[1:45:46] you've come too late I know they're
[1:45:48] cessationists I told you recently that
[1:45:50] the cessationist movement is growing in
[1:45:53] the world and people that have never
[1:45:56] believed that these things have come to
[1:45:57] an end now believe that he only healed
[1:46:00] in the days of the early Apostles
[1:46:02] because of the of the atmosphere of the
[1:46:04] day and they had to have the
[1:46:06] supernatural to get the church
[1:46:08] established well I want you to know
[1:46:09] something since our God does not have
[1:46:12] the nature of starting off with the bang
[1:46:14] and dwindling down until he Fizzles out
[1:46:17] at the end I'm going to take him at his
[1:46:20] word that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:46:22] yesterday today and today and forever
[1:46:25] and I'm not going to be a cessationist
[1:46:27] and I'm not going to believe that he
[1:46:29] doesn't heal anymore and I'm not going
[1:46:31] to believe that he doesn't move anymore
[1:46:33] and I'm going to believe that there is a
[1:46:35] New Testament Church rising
[1:46:38] up and that Prophet said that if this
[1:46:41] Vine ever puts forth
[1:46:45] another
[1:46:48] Branch it'll be a starchy
[1:46:54] emotionless
[1:46:56] oppressed
[1:47:01] people well that's what I see a
[1:47:06] lot so quiet till the only thing you can
[1:47:09] hear is a spider run across the carpet
[1:47:13] it's not about
[1:47:14] noise I'm not saying it's about noise
[1:47:17] but I want you to know there's something
[1:47:19] wrong with you if you can sit in the
[1:47:22] spirit of God moving all around you and
[1:47:25] you never feel compelled to raise up
[1:47:28] your hands and say Lord I Thank you that
[1:47:31] I'm alive I thank you that the very
[1:47:34] breath that's in my lungs is because of
[1:47:37] you come on you don't have to jump
[1:47:40] around I'm a jumper I I'm just obnoxious
[1:47:44] you don't have to be like
[1:47:45] me but what you can't do is be so dead
[1:47:50] dry that you don't believe
[1:47:53] so that when crisis strikes or tragedy
[1:47:56] strikes you've got to call on somebody
[1:47:59] else to get a hold of God for you
[1:48:02] instead of getting hold of him for
[1:48:04] yourself the way to stay stay sure of
[1:48:07] that is to keep all the dead cats off
[1:48:08] the
[1:48:10] line I want you to call me I want you to
[1:48:12] text me I want to pray with you but I
[1:48:15] want you to know there may be a time
[1:48:18] that you can't get me and you can use
[1:48:21] that time
[1:48:27] oh they said Benjamin was singing The
[1:48:29] Royal telephone not too long ago and
[1:48:31] somebody said some one streamer watching
[1:48:34] not a not a Believer this message said
[1:48:37] well that's about the oldest dustiest
[1:48:38] song I've ever heard and it's just about
[1:48:40] irrelevant and I can't believe that
[1:48:42] people today would say what do you mean
[1:48:45] Central's never
[1:48:47] busy always on the line you can talk to

[1:49:27] text somebody else the answer is on the
[1:49:30] way because he said it was now let me
[1:49:31] stay with my let me stay with my thought
[1:49:33] it's your attitude towards Jesus he said
[1:49:36] look at Mark 11:24 that was the second
[1:49:38] verse we read whatsoever things you
[1:49:41] desire When you pray believe you receive
[1:49:42] it that's the order of the word now
[1:49:47] that's paragraph 21 that's the order of
[1:49:51] the word now now believe now you receive
[1:49:56] it it shall be given unto you is that
[1:50:02] right he said you shall have whatever
[1:50:04] you've asked for if you believe it and
[1:50:08] now if Jesus paid for it there why I
[1:50:11] believe it I accept it believe it and
[1:50:18] go
[1:50:20] witnessing testifying
[1:50:24] confessing that it is already done
[1:50:27] there's the ABCs right there in Matthew
[1:50:31] 2122 give me a few more moments I'm
[1:50:33] watching Matthew 21:22 and all things I
[1:50:37] got to get off page two so they won't
[1:50:39] bother me about it Matthew 21:22 and all
[1:50:43] things whatsoever you shall ask in
[1:50:45] prayer believing ye shall receive John
[1:50:49] 14:14 if you shall ask anything in my
[1:50:51] name
[1:50:54] I will do it I need some help John 15:7
[1:50:57] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:51:00] you you shall ask what you
[1:51:04] will are you remembering any Divine
[1:51:06] promises that you've been holding on to
[1:51:09] God for and you've been waiting on God
[1:51:11] and maybe tonight you find out that
[1:51:13] God's been waiting on you it's time to
[1:51:15] meet in the middle it's time to call the
[1:51:18] Divine standstill off it's time to
[1:51:21] follow the order of the word we accept
[1:51:24] that it's true that it's right we
[1:51:26] believe in our heart with faith and we
[1:51:28] call it we confess it we testify of it
[1:51:32] that it's done in a message the angel of
[1:51:36] God he said in the best that I know how
[1:51:38] to do Christian friend is to give out
[1:51:40] these cards remember the prayer cards
[1:51:43] that they gave out because the crowds
[1:51:45] were there and then cards were numbered
[1:51:47] and under inspiration they would call
[1:51:49] out the numbers and and the people would
[1:51:52] come and line up in the in the num in
[1:51:55] the line and the prayer line and and
[1:51:58] people would be healed and and so forth
[1:52:00] he said well well that's the that's the
[1:52:02] best I I can do is to give out these
[1:52:04] cards but friends did you
[1:52:06] notice there's more people gets healed
[1:52:09] out there without
[1:52:14] cards then there is healed here with the
[1:52:17] card see there's more you don't need the
[1:52:20] card
[1:52:22] why he's shutting his own healing line
[1:52:24] down
[1:52:25] almost so you don't have to come at 2
[1:52:28] o'clock in the afternoon to get in by
[1:52:30] 7 because he's telling you that even if
[1:52:33] you don't have a card you've got the
[1:52:35] same
[1:52:36] access that's somebody who holds a card
[1:52:39] has somebody said oh if brother Brandon
[1:52:42] was just alive today oh if brother
[1:52:44] Brandon was just here today oh if Paul
[1:52:46] was just here today we could get our
[1:52:48] needs met if that's your mentality no
[1:52:51] wonder
[1:52:53] no wonder you're not seeing God move in
[1:52:56] your
[1:52:57] life he's not a yesteryear god he's a
[1:53:00] today God too he was God then he is God
[1:53:04] now he will be God throughout eternity
[1:53:08] isn't that the truth you don't need the
[1:53:11] card the card's just merely to keep you
[1:53:12] lined
[1:53:13] up oh my goodness did you know people
[1:53:16] were trying to sell prayer
[1:53:18] cards
[1:53:20] really they tried to sell them
[1:53:23] there were people that that went home
[1:53:26] deflated because they didn't get a
[1:53:28] prayer card that's one of the reasons
[1:53:31] why brother brandom I've actually met
[1:53:33] people through the years that didn't get
[1:53:35] a prayer card and went home left the
[1:53:37] service so
[1:53:40] disappointed that they didn't get a
[1:53:42] prayer card what if it would have been
[1:53:44] in 51 when he said this you don't need a
[1:53:46] prayer card and that's not the only time

[1:53:50] it how many times are we listening to
[1:53:52] into a prayer line he said what's that

[1:53:57] platform the pastor of the king of kings

[1:55:08] doctors told them there was no hope
[1:55:10] there was no hope that that that per
[1:55:12] perhaps even both of them had something
[1:55:15] wrong with them and they wouldn't be
[1:55:16] able to have a baby but they went to the
[1:55:18] meeting that night my mom so
[1:55:19] disappointed that she didn't have a
[1:55:21] prayer card but she sat there on the

[1:55:42] platform she said if I have found favor
[1:55:45] in your sight God pass by

[1:57:29] test here we've been married all these
[1:57:31] years and no hope and the doctor said no
[1:57:34] reason to hope that there perhap they
[1:57:37] knew the mother had a big issue and
[1:57:39] perhaps even the father had an issue and
[1:57:42] they had almost given up hope but not
[1:57:46] not her she said you're the same God I
[1:57:49] got to go through it again somebody

[1:57:57] platform woo on Mother's Day I preached
[1:58:00] a message about a mother's Faith a real

[1:58:05] airplane here was a real woman's faith
[1:58:08] not yet a mother but already had a
[1:58:10] mother's heart that said God if you do

[1:59:13] because I know that some people believe
[1:59:15] that if you don't go to a message Church

[1:59:19] certainly know better than that

[2:02:23] enough we you've got to go you've got to
[2:02:25] reserve your strength for the rest of
[2:02:26] the meeting brother Billy Paul starts
[2:02:28] backing up and and he's backing brother
[2:02:31] brandom up like this pulling him like
[2:02:34] this toward the edge of the stage where
[2:02:36] he's going to spin him around and help
[2:02:37] him get down because his body was so
[2:02:40] physically drained and so physically
[2:02:43] weak from the faith pull of the people
[2:02:46] because people were pulling on
[2:02:50] him some were were pulling on him
[2:02:53] instead of pulling on God but there was
[2:02:56] a a father I believe and a child and I'm
[2:03:00] I'm sorry to tell you that I don't
[2:03:01] remember if it was a boy or a girl but
[2:03:03] I'm thinking that it was a girl please
[2:03:05] forgive me I I think it was a girl
[2:03:09] brother Gerald Cleveland there brother
[2:03:11] brother West in the same meetings sister
[2:03:13] West's dad sponsored the meeting brother
[2:03:18] Stucky brother brandom's about to go off
[2:03:21] the platform
[2:03:22] and all of a sudden he stiffens up and
[2:03:25] he says wait a minute Paul there's one
[2:03:33] more you might say that that little
[2:03:35] child and dad was pulling on brother
[2:03:36] brandom I believe that that individual
[2:03:40] was pulling on the Lord and the Lord
[2:03:43] stopped his Prophet I believe that black
[2:03:46] mamy wasn't calling on on Elijah she was
[2:03:49] calling on the god of Elijah
[2:03:52] come on I believe that dad and his
[2:03:54] little girl I believe it was were
[2:03:56] calling on the Lord and he said just one
[2:03:59] more he said I just saw that little
[2:04:01] child there because they had been
[2:04:02] inching their way all the time closer
[2:04:06] and closer and closer to the
[2:04:08] front and brother brandham caught them
[2:04:10] it wasn't his eye that caught them it
[2:04:12] was the faith that they had in God that
[2:04:13] caught them and he said just one more
[2:04:15] Paul he straightened right up and he put
[2:04:18] his arm up in the air and he said to
[2:04:22] before he did he said to the little
[2:04:24] little boy to the dad is that your Sho
[2:04:27] is that your shoes there in that
[2:04:30] box and they witnessed that indeed it
[2:04:32] was can you imagine crippled
[2:04:36] feet couldn't wear shoes but went to
[2:04:39] church prepared to wear shoes that's
[2:04:42] Faith that's the kind of faith we have
[2:04:45] to have that's the order of the
[2:04:46] word well I just saw that little child
[2:04:49] running all over this building healed
[2:04:52] right that's what he
[2:04:54] said and he rared up and he put his hand
[2:04:57] in the air and he said
[2:04:59] Satan turn her loose in the name of
[2:05:03] Jesus
[2:05:05] Christ didn't need a vision didn't need
[2:05:08] an
[2:05:09] interview didn't need a dip seven times
[2:05:12] in the muddy Jordan Faith had touched
[2:05:15] God God had moved on the prophet that
[2:05:18] little child jumped up and didn't wait
[2:05:20] on her shoes
[2:05:22] ran barefooted across that Auditorium
[2:05:25] and brother Cleveland said brother
[2:05:27] Shelly he told me multiple time did you
[2:05:29] ever meet Brother Cleveland brother
[2:05:31] Templeton you met sister
[2:05:34] Delane brother Gerald is the one who
[2:05:37] witnessed to
[2:05:38] me tears every time he told it running
[2:05:41] down his face he said brother Shelly we
[2:05:43] were there I think they had a wire I
[2:05:45] think he was there with a wire
[2:05:47] recorder the wax discs I believe that
[2:05:49] was about the time that they were still
[2:05:51] using using the wax disc and he had
[2:05:54] borrowed one so he could get close to
[2:05:56] the front he said I didn't know very
[2:05:58] much about running it but I needed to be
[2:06:01] close and he said I was so close that
[2:06:04] when that Prophet spoke that word in the
[2:06:06] name of the Lord Satan turn him loose in
[2:06:09] the name of Jesus Christ he said brother
[2:06:11] Shelly tears running down his face my
[2:06:14] children have heard him tell it he said
[2:06:16] I heard some saw but I heard those bones
[2:06:21] I was close enough to hear those bones
[2:06:24] popping and snapping as God took those
[2:06:28] Twisted mangled feet and made that child
[2:06:31] a new
[2:06:36] pair went home wearing the shoes but
[2:06:39] didn't need them to receive the
[2:06:42] [Music]
[2:06:45] miracle he's the same God if you think
[2:06:49] he's finished if you think that's over
[2:06:52] if you think that this message came to
[2:06:54] just tell you what God was sir you are
[2:06:57] so sadly
[2:06:59] mistaken he said let let's finish this
[2:07:01] he said it it's not your leg so much
[2:07:04] your it happens here in your heart you
[2:07:05] believe it you hold it and it
[2:07:08] materializes 47 he said every seed I got
[2:07:11] to hurry 8 8:00
[2:07:15] woo said um every seed will bring forth
[2:07:19] of its kind is that right wheat will
[2:07:21] bring forth wheat barley barley corn
[2:07:22] corn is that right he said well Jesus
[2:07:25] said the word of God was a
[2:07:27] seed isn't that
[2:07:29] right Jesus said the word of God was a
[2:07:32] seed now Mark 11:24 is that a seed then
[2:07:35] he's
[2:07:36] asking if the word of God is a seed is
[2:07:39] Mark 11:24 a seed how many of you know
[2:07:43] it is it said therefore I say unto you
[2:07:45] what things soever you desire When you
[2:07:47] pray believe that you receive them and
[2:07:48] you shall have them isn't that a seed I
[2:07:51] think that's a seed Jesus said
[2:07:54] whatsoever things you desire When you
[2:07:55] pray believe you receive it and you
[2:07:57] shall have it now the order of the
[2:08:03] scripture believe now you receive it
[2:08:07] present
[2:08:08] tense in the future it'll be given to
[2:08:13] you now does anybody believe God can do
[2:08:15] something
[2:08:17] instantaneously oh oh I heard someone
[2:08:20] try to define the difference in a
[2:08:21] miracle and a healing don't do that for
[2:08:24] me somebody said if it's instant it's a
[2:08:26] miracle if it's Progressive it's a
[2:08:29] healing oh no no no no no I don't know
[2:08:32] if that's right or not that doesn't
[2:08:34] always just witness with me I've seen
[2:08:36] God take his time with a
[2:08:39] miracle a miracle is something
[2:08:42] Supernatural that defies the laws of
[2:08:44] nature that baffles the
[2:08:47] baffler shocks the doctor and yet
[2:08:50] brother brandom said said the greatest
[2:08:52] Miracle is not the healing of the body
[2:08:55] in the first place it's the salvation of
[2:08:57] the soul in that Redemption is the
[2:09:00] greatest Miracle that's ever taken so
[2:09:02] I'm not going to try to define the
[2:09:03] difference between a healing and a
[2:09:04] miracle but do you still believe God can
[2:09:06] do instantaneous things you still
[2:09:09] believe that in some cases suddenly can
[2:09:11] mean suddenly and now can mean now
[2:09:13] anybody give up on now meaning now and
[2:09:16] suddenly meaning
[2:09:18] suddenly does anybody in here know that
[2:09:20] this thing can turn on a dime and what
[2:09:23] you've been begging God waiting on God
[2:09:26] to do if that inspiration if that little
[2:09:30] button of light in you if inspiration
[2:09:33] will strike that seed word in you and
[2:09:36] you begin to say it's
[2:09:40] done I'm through
[2:09:44] weeping I'm through
[2:09:46] grieving I'm through ringing my
[2:09:50] hands I'm going to take the Bible order
[2:09:54] the order of the
[2:09:56] word I'm going to well yeah but you know
[2:09:59] we
[2:10:00] believed we believed we believed for
[2:10:03] brothers we beli for
[2:10:10] sisters you cannot let that is God
[2:10:17] Sovereign I got to say this I'm going to
[2:10:19] try to hush
[2:10:23] thank you brother I believe I
[2:10:25] will
[2:10:27] um we still hear Believers saying stupid
[2:10:34] things it's that old
[2:10:37] hospital that's a good place to go
[2:10:40] die if they'd been in a better
[2:10:43] Hospital they'd have
[2:10:45] lived it's that old medicine they put
[2:10:47] him on F have put on put him on a better
[2:10:49] medicine
[2:10:52] if they' just had a better doctor I want
[2:10:54] to tell you something either God's
[2:10:55] Sovereign or not and if God is calling
[2:10:59] your loved one's home we can stand on
[2:11:01] our heads and roll in the floor and beg
[2:11:04] and grieve and cry how do you know
[2:11:06] preacher because I've done it yes sir I
[2:11:09] have begged God sir I didn't want my
[2:11:12] granny to die she was too young to leave
[2:11:14] here in my mind I begged God I I I
[2:11:18] didn't follow the Bible order
[2:11:21] I begged God I I pleaded with God I
[2:11:26] promised God everything that I could
[2:11:28] think of to promise him if he would just
[2:11:31] heal my big
[2:11:32] mama and not take her for at this time
[2:11:36] and and and God don't you know that that
[2:11:39] that God would have loved to have given
[2:11:41] me my request Lord but he had a
[2:11:44] sovereign
[2:11:46] Bland he was sending me to Columbus
[2:11:50] Georgia he had a sovereign
[2:11:53] plan he knew that a Bible order had come
[2:11:56] to my grandmother's life and yet if she
[2:11:58] would have lived for many years that
[2:12:00] that
[2:12:02] pull would have been on her she would
[2:12:05] have
[2:12:06] struggled she spent over 40 years in
[2:12:11] Ministry when the word
[2:12:15] came
[2:12:17] Jonathan's
[2:12:19] grandparents and my grand parents were
[2:12:22] close
[2:12:23] friends my granny preached the valley
[2:12:27] every church every congregational
[2:12:30] Holiness Church every emanu Holiness
[2:12:34] Church she preached meetings there there
[2:12:37] are people in the valley right now alive
[2:12:40] healed in Granny's meetings and serving
[2:12:43] God saved in Granny's meetings but when
[2:12:45] the order of the word came she said well
[2:12:49] you mean I've done that all these years
[2:12:51] and it wasn't my responsibility yes
[2:12:53] ma'am then I'll never do it
[2:12:58] again his grandparents saw the message
[2:13:00] of the
[2:13:01] Hour his dad and they went to they went
[2:13:04] to on the wings of a snow white dove in
[2:13:06] shreport Louisiana and they were close
[2:13:08] they supported my granny's Ministry
[2:13:10] wherever she was preaching they went but
[2:13:12] the message came and when God revealed
[2:13:15] to them the order of the
[2:13:17] word they had to pull away
[2:13:21] but I would never believe you could
[2:13:23] never convince me that that that
[2:13:26] grandmother Hollis didn't keep praying
[2:13:28] for her
[2:13:30] friend Lord you know Sister Mildred
[2:13:33] sincere before you I want you to show
[2:13:35] her the way I want you to reveal
[2:13:38] yourself to her come on and I know that
[2:13:40] Jonathan's dad did because as soon as I
[2:13:43] had heard the word he come down to my
[2:13:45] place with not with Steve but he come
[2:13:48] with a big big uh
[2:13:52] anyway he came down to my Granny's house
[2:13:54] and began to tell talk to her and he
[2:13:57] began to tell her sister Shelly all
[2:13:59] these years we prayed for
[2:14:01] you and God didn't forget you and God
[2:14:04] has revealed himself to you let me tell
[2:14:06] you something that was many years after
[2:14:09] they were
[2:14:10] gone prayer means
[2:14:13] something they didn't see the
[2:14:15] Fulfillment of the prayer they prayed
[2:14:18] the prayer they believed it perhaps they
[2:14:21] left here calling it done but it wasn't
[2:14:24] until a appointed
[2:14:27] time so all my praying to keep granny
[2:14:30] here was not in the Sovereign Mind Of
[2:14:32] God so it wasn't a better cancer
[2:14:34] treatment and it's not a better doctor
[2:14:37] come on and it's not a better hospital
[2:14:40] and it's not a hack nurse it's a
[2:14:42] sovereignty of God but don't you dare
[2:14:45] let the fact that God call some of his
[2:14:48] people out of here to spare them
[2:14:54] oh I've asked God I've asked the Lord
[2:14:57] why why born now why in this
[2:15:00] season why didn't you let me be born in
[2:15:03] another day I I wasn't made for this at
[2:15:05] this time I
[2:15:08] wasn't it grates on my nerves and
[2:15:10] Grieves
[2:15:12] me I see what's happening in the church
[2:15:15] in the believing church and how they've
[2:15:18] gone back to pick up the things they
[2:15:20] condemned 25 and 30 years ago and I
[2:15:22] would I think Lord God why wasn't I born
[2:15:25] in another day but God is Sovereign he
[2:15:28] puts you right where he wants you for
[2:15:30] such a time as the one appointed for you
[2:15:32] and just because somebody you loved God
[2:15:35] chose to take them home don't you let
[2:15:37] that stop your
[2:15:39] faith I've had people say to me but it's
[2:15:42] the same kind of cancer so what well
[2:15:46] it's the same doctor so what well
[2:15:49] they're laying hopeless in the same
[2:15:51] hospital so what we're going to take God
[2:15:54] at his
[2:15:55] word we're going to
[2:15:58] believe he said that's the order of the
[2:16:00] word now believe now you receive it it
[2:16:02] shall be given is that right I believe
[2:16:03] it I accept it believe it and go and go
[2:16:08] what
[2:16:09] testifying that's 21 and go testifying
[2:16:13] did I go back what' I do angel of God oh
[2:16:18] well I was just giving you that quote
[2:16:19] again because I thought you might need
[2:16:20] need it you
[2:16:23] know see see he said present tense in
[2:16:27] the future will be given to you what
[2:16:28] your the things you desire if you pray
[2:16:30] believe you receive them and it shall be
[2:16:31] given on you see you shall receive it in
[2:16:33] the future just accept it believe it and
[2:16:36] what stay with
[2:16:39] it water it oh my pour some water on the
[2:16:46] promise believe it it'll come to pass
[2:16:51] God's
[2:16:53] under let me make sure we're in the
[2:16:54] right place isn't he God's
[2:17:00] under God doesn't need you pounding The
[2:17:02] Altar and obligating
[2:17:05] him he's
[2:17:07] obligated
[2:17:11] himself when you approach God don't you
[2:17:13] give him your track
[2:17:14] record you don't have to say now I've
[2:17:17] been faithful to church and I barely
[2:17:18] miss a Tuesday night and I and I pay my
[2:17:20] time
[2:17:22] oh I've tried all
[2:17:26] that I've never heard him laugh but I
[2:17:29] wonder if he's ever laughed at
[2:17:31] me what do you mean reciting your
[2:17:34] pedigree or something here that's not
[2:17:36] what I'm looking for that's God wants me
[2:17:39] to be faithful to his house God wants me
[2:17:41] to pay my tithe but the order of the
[2:17:43] word is not what I what I do how I
[2:17:46] perform what my behavior is
[2:17:52] I've got to believe it I've got to
[2:17:54] confess it I've got to testify of it
[2:17:57] I've got to say it is
[2:18:01] done and it shall be musicians are
[2:18:06] coming I'm I'm on page
[2:18:10] three we go and have a little fellowship
[2:18:16] and maybe in August we'll have a
[2:18:19] somebody else that can
[2:18:21] preach I don't have to
[2:18:26] preach but I was ready
[2:18:28] to well I noticed you was out here early
[2:18:31] yeah I I get out here as early as I can
[2:18:35] I know what church order said but I
[2:18:37] don't wait until I get here to get my
[2:18:40] sermon or or to get myself
[2:18:45] ready I start doing that quite
[2:18:48] early come on because when I get here I
[2:18:51] want to worship amen I've heard little
[2:18:54] little story you know little martyr
[2:18:56] things and people say oh oh I'd really
[2:18:58] love I would just so much love to be out
[2:19:00] there but I've got to I got to do what
[2:19:02] the prophet said and keep the church
[2:19:04] order and so forth listen I was in a
[2:19:06] meeting in Ryan Oak Virginia one time
[2:19:09] and uh your pastor's father brother
[2:19:12] Henry green and brother Dan daisley had
[2:19:15] driven from rutherton to Rowan Oak
[2:19:18] Virginia to hear me preach
[2:19:21] and they did travel and I preached for
[2:19:23] them many times and in those days just a
[2:19:26] kid and they traveled as often as they
[2:19:29] could to encourage me did you did you
[2:19:32] know brother Henry green you probably
[2:19:33] didn't ever meet him you're just
[2:19:36] young I I probably got socks in my
[2:19:39] drawer older than you
[2:19:41] brother but
[2:19:43] anyway uh they came in that night I
[2:19:46] won't say who the pastor is he might
[2:19:48] still be as dry now as he is he might be
[2:19:51] on I don't know but we were having a
[2:19:53] wonderful meeting but he expressly said
[2:19:56] to me now I know you got a little
[2:19:59] Pentecostal flare and he said now you'll
[2:20:02] settle down after you've been in the
[2:20:03] message a few years you you'll get all
[2:20:05] that taken care
[2:20:06] of Joshua you recently rode with him in
[2:20:09] a golf
[2:20:11] cart in Virginia but
[2:20:14] anyway he says but I I need you to I
[2:20:17] need you to stay and he said when it's
[2:20:19] time for you to come out there will be a
[2:20:21] red light bulb that'll come on there in
[2:20:23] the
[2:20:24] office and it's it's imperative for you
[2:20:27] to stay back there until that red light
[2:20:29] comes on and then you come
[2:20:36] out I said yes sir but I didn't mean
[2:20:42] it you know that's just a little much
[2:20:44] for
[2:20:45] me them folks got to sing and that was
[2:20:47] when they really worshiped and sung I'm
[2:20:49] telling you they got got to singing and
[2:20:51] the floors got to rattling they got to
[2:20:53] having themselves a good time and I was
[2:20:58] miserable I wanted to be right in the
[2:21:00] minute I didn't think that red light
[2:21:01] bulb would ever come
[2:21:03] on and brother Henry green I I know more
[2:21:08] had come to the pull pit than he stood
[2:21:11] up and prophesied over my life boy what
[2:21:14] would they do with
[2:21:16] that publicly in that room without a
[2:21:20] without a room and without three judges
[2:21:22] and so forth he prophesied over my life
[2:21:26] many of things that have certainly come
[2:21:29] to pass at the end of that service it
[2:21:32] seems to me like the pastor recognized
[2:21:34] them to to give a little testimony or a
[2:21:37] little greeting and pray over the
[2:21:39] service he specified to brother Henry
[2:21:41] Green from your
[2:21:44] seat and brother Henry green began to
[2:21:47] you know thank God for the service and
[2:21:49] the preaching and the moving of the
[2:21:51] spirit and this is just life and he
[2:21:54] said he said I I I had a
[2:21:58] vision I I saw something in my mind's
[2:22:02] eye he said I'm not going to blame the
[2:22:03] Lord for it but he said I was trying to
[2:22:08] imagine brother
[2:22:10] Shelly stuck in that office back there
[2:22:14] behind that door he said I've preached
[2:22:16] here before and he said I I know about
[2:22:18] the red light
[2:22:21] the whole church sitting there he said
[2:22:23] and and he said to be honest with you I
[2:22:25] wanted to scream out here comes brother
[2:22:29] Shelly out of shoot number
[2:22:34] nine why because he knew that I wanted
[2:22:38] to be in that
[2:22:41] atmosphere I read today where the
[2:22:43] Prophet said atmosphere is
[2:22:46] everything it's
[2:22:48] everything Hallelujah you you can take a
[2:22:51] chicken egg and put it under a hound dog
[2:22:54] Daddy Bosworth said and it'll hatch it's
[2:22:58] not the mother it's the
[2:23:00] atmosphere it's not what laid the egg oh
[2:23:04] my let's build an atmosphere here before
[2:23:07] we go home let's come
[2:23:12] tomorrow I want to see you let me tell
[2:23:14] you something I've been waiting with
[2:23:19] you I've known some of you since the
[2:23:21] early
[2:23:23] 90s I've been waiting with you for some
[2:23:26] of those promises I want to see them
[2:23:28] come to pass in your life I want to be
[2:23:31] here I want to be alive to see you hold
[2:23:35] your promise in your
[2:23:38] arms I I like Simeon and Anna I don't
[2:23:42] want to die until I've seen the Lord's
[2:23:45] salvation manifested in your life with a
[2:23:48] Divine promise that has materialized
[2:23:50] I I want to be around to see that so I'm
[2:23:54] not preaching this to judge you or
[2:23:55] condemn you I'm preaching this to
[2:23:57] inspire you we've got to raise our
[2:23:59] expectations a little higher this is
[2:24:02] this is the last
[2:24:04] quotation and tomorrow I'm going to
[2:24:06] contrast the difference between
[2:24:08] Zacharias and
[2:24:09] Mary same
[2:24:12] theme in paragraph 46 he said Now
[2:24:14] quickly before the time gets away I I'll
[2:24:17] put it in my own words see a and I was
[2:24:20] quoting his words he said fear not for I
[2:24:22] am sent from the presence of God tell
[2:24:24] you that you're a peculiar birth and
[2:24:26] Life to indicate that you're to take a
[2:24:28] gift of Divine Healing to the peoples of
[2:24:30] the world does anybody recognize that
[2:24:32] that's the Angel's commission to brother
[2:24:34] brandham someone said how do you know
[2:24:36] that happened because the the signs and
[2:24:38] the Miracles and the Wonders and the
[2:24:40] manifestations of it followed the
[2:24:41] ministry that's how I know and that's
[2:24:44] why I'm not falling off the wagon
[2:24:46] because we don't know how many people
[2:24:48] fell off the bridge and we think there
[2:24:50] might be another reason for the cloud
[2:24:51] and we're not sure if everything was
[2:24:53] just like it was supposed to be I want
[2:24:55] you to know I'm not following this
[2:24:57] message because brother brandom had a
[2:24:59] gift of divine
[2:25:01] recall I'm following this truth because
[2:25:03] it lines up with the word and I not only
[2:25:06] know the Miracles I've not only sat down
[2:25:08] with the Miracles I've not only heard
[2:25:10] the testimony of the Miracles I've seen
[2:25:13] God continuing to honor this word by
[2:25:16] performing Miracles among us even
[2:25:19] now he he is the
[2:25:21] same you said fear not you be sincere
[2:25:25] when you pray and get the people to
[2:25:26] believe you nothing shall stand before
[2:25:27] your prayer not even to cancer and
[2:25:30] listen to what brother Brandon throws in
[2:25:31] right in the middle of that now watch
[2:25:33] the
[2:25:34] order what order is he talking about I
[2:25:37] assume he's referring back to the order
[2:25:39] of the Bible the order of the scripture
[2:25:40] he calls it he said God sent the gift
[2:25:42] nearly 40 years about 40 years ago it's
[2:25:45] been in the world ever since this
[2:25:46] pardoning he calls it and now the thing
[2:25:49] I was to do was to pray for the sick and
[2:25:51] be sincere when I prayed and nothing
[2:25:53] would stand before the prayer I want you
[2:25:56] to hear what the commission said if you
[2:25:58] can get the people to believe
[2:26:02] you see the order now that angel didn't
[2:26:06] say if you can get the people to believe
[2:26:07] in
[2:26:09] you it said if you can get the people to
[2:26:12] believe
[2:26:13] you what were they to believe they were
[2:26:16] to believe the
[2:26:18] word and the word said ask anything come
[2:26:22] on this was not building a following for
[2:26:25] himself oh no no no no no he had
[2:26:29] preached the word of faith at night he
[2:26:30] was going to preach the word of faith
[2:26:32] that night he's talking about believing
[2:26:34] the word that comes forth he said see
[2:26:38] the order now see the thing of it is the
[2:26:40] thing is to get the people to
[2:26:43] believe that this is the
[2:26:48] truth what the the word that was
[2:26:50] preached that night the message that God
[2:26:53] was delivering to the people that is
[2:26:56] what he was told get the PE if you can
[2:26:58] get the people to believe and I said to
[2:27:00] the
[2:27:01] angel now you got that part have you the
[2:27:04] gift is not to the
[2:27:06] discernment listen the gift is to pray
[2:27:09] for the sick and get them to believe
[2:27:12] you you get what I mean nothing shall
[2:27:15] stand before the prayer not even the
[2:27:17] cancer that's just to pray for the sick
[2:27:20] and tell them he's coming to something
[2:27:23] said now I'm going to pray for you you
[2:27:25] believe I believe with all my heart and
[2:27:27] lay hands over on them and pray for them
[2:27:30] and ask the blessing in the name of the
[2:27:33] Lord Jesus and pass them
[2:27:38] on I know we hear the
[2:27:40] Visions I know we hear the the
[2:27:43] discernment I know we have the
[2:27:45] testimony like he said to Sister West
[2:27:48] your back trouble go your way way
[2:27:50] believing your back troubles left
[2:27:52] you or to other stories that we know
[2:27:55] sister yordis who has come here from
[2:27:58] Norway and giving you her testimony
[2:28:00] where God performs such miraculous
[2:28:03] things but I want you to know there were
[2:28:05] many people that he just prayed over
[2:28:07] them in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:28:09] Christ receive your believe believe no
[2:28:12] vision no discernment no doctor's names
[2:28:15] no addresses nothing just go
[2:28:18] believing do you understand it it wasn't
[2:28:20] everybody didn't need to have the vision
[2:28:22] everybody didn't have to the gift didn't
[2:28:24] have to operate for everybody he said
[2:28:26] they're supposed to go away rejoicing
[2:28:29] believing they're going to get well you
[2:28:32] see some wouldn't have had the
[2:28:34] faith had God not called their doctor's
[2:28:36] name God was helping people I want you
[2:28:39] to know God was merciful why because
[2:28:41] that was an hour that the son of man had
[2:28:43] risen with healing in his
[2:28:45] wings God was performing his word by
[2:28:48] getting the people's Faith where it
[2:28:49] needed to be but everybody didn't need
[2:28:52] uh to know what was in their purse to
[2:28:54] believe so some people they just
[2:28:56] pronounce the blessing on they're
[2:28:58] supposed to go away rejoicing believing
[2:29:00] they're going to get well the
[2:29:02] supposed to believe they're going to
[2:29:03] walk the blind supposed to believe
[2:29:05] they're going to
[2:29:07] see I want you to understand that the
[2:29:09] responsibility for the miracle was never
[2:29:13] on brother brandom shoulder except for
[2:29:16] the fact that it was his responsibility
[2:29:18] to help the people
[2:29:22] believe it was their responsibility to
[2:29:26] believe and if he just passed them on
[2:29:29] through the line it was their
[2:29:31] responsibility to go
[2:29:34] rejoicing sister West had nursed that
[2:29:37] bad back and she'd sat on a pillow and
[2:29:39] and her tailbone was so injured and and
[2:29:42] brother Wes wasn't going to miss a
[2:29:44] meeting so he puts her in the car and
[2:29:46] hauls her to Jeffersonville from from uh
[2:29:49] I guess I guess Huntsville then I don't
[2:29:52] guess I were living in making then and
[2:29:54] she's sitting on the
[2:29:56] donut in so much pain don't diminish
[2:29:59] that
[2:30:00] pain I found it I found the bottom of
[2:30:04] some slick steps in Canada I never
[2:30:07] picked up a suitcase for years that I
[2:30:10] didn't remember that pain it came back
[2:30:13] lifting a suitcase she was in awful
[2:30:16] shape here she goes up there she said
[2:30:19] brother Shelly I couldn't believe I
[2:30:20] couldn't believe Benny was almost almost
[2:30:22] dragging me to go but she said I wanted
[2:30:24] I wanted to go I I mean I really wanted
[2:30:26] to but I just was in so much pain and he
[2:30:30] said go your way she comes up there go
[2:30:32] your way your back troubles left you I
[2:30:35] don't even think he touched
[2:30:37] her she said I couldn't have helped but
[2:30:40] believe she said there was such a
[2:30:43] presence that wasn't brother brandom's
[2:30:45] presence oh no that was the Lord's
[2:30:48] presence that's why brother brand was
[2:30:49] such a a humble and non-assuming sort of
[2:30:52] fell it wasn't his personality that
[2:30:54] caused people to believe oh no I know
[2:30:57] leaders that sat in those meetings and
[2:31:00] when brother brandham came out and and
[2:31:02] looked down over the microphone and said
[2:31:04] good evening friends I know believers
[2:31:07] who said that was the most amazing
[2:31:09] statement they'd ever heard in their
[2:31:10] life good evening friends I know other
[2:31:12] church leaders who said what am I doing
[2:31:16] here who is this who what are we going
[2:31:20] to hear tonight from this little bashful
[2:31:24] fellow that's what Tommy osbor
[2:31:27] said what what what are we going to hear
[2:31:29] from this little bashful fellow but he
[2:31:31] said then in a moment I had a vision I
[2:31:35] saw the Lord Jesus standing on the
[2:31:37] corner of the stage and I watched him
[2:31:39] walk across that stage and step into
[2:31:42] that little
[2:31:44] gentleman and he said then I understood
[2:31:47] the authority of the ministry when he
[2:31:49] started talking see that was to keep the
[2:31:51] focus on the Lord the angel of the Lord
[2:31:54] and not the servant amen sister Wes said
[2:31:57] it was like clouds brother shell she
[2:31:59] said I thought I was walking out through
[2:32:01] the clouds I thought I had left the
[2:32:02] auditorium and every step I made it was
[2:32:05] like I was getting higher and higher and
[2:32:07] higher I said how was your back she said
[2:32:10] my back trouble was
[2:32:15] gone brother brandom didn't heal
[2:32:18] her go your way what
[2:32:21] believing that atmosphere was so
[2:32:23] powerful she she had to believe she
[2:32:26] could feel it it was tangible and she
[2:32:28] just I I I I I believe I I I take it and
[2:32:32] never suffered in that way
[2:32:35] again the same way that God blessed them
[2:32:38] with children when brother brandom told
[2:32:40] them when you have children raise them
[2:32:42] in church he didn't say thus sayith the
[2:32:45] Lord You're going to have one he just
[2:32:47] said when you have them it takes Faith
[2:32:49] some some time to KN knit a booty
[2:32:53] remember a virgin shall conceive and and
[2:32:56] somebody some little virgin girl maidens
[2:32:59] for Generations took out their kneading
[2:33:01] nles excuse me knitting I I may say
[2:33:04] something terrible here knitting
[2:33:08] needles and began to
[2:33:12] knit booties believing for the
[2:33:15] possibility that I might be one of them
[2:33:18] that's the kind of faith I like amen
[2:33:20] well what if you're not well what if you
[2:33:22] are bring your shoes what if you what if
[2:33:25] you don't need them what if you
[2:33:27] do you make up your mind tonight I want
[2:33:29] you to stand thank you so much you you
[2:33:31] have you you certainly have been
[2:33:34] wonderful and
[2:33:35] gracious and I know this isn't what you
[2:33:37] were expecting on Saturday night
[2:33:38] fellowship meeting but I couldn't help
[2:33:41] it I couldn't got away from this if I
[2:33:42] have wanted to I want the Bible order of
[2:33:45] things I I want to receive the Divine
[2:33:49] promise of God
[2:33:50] in manifestation and materialization in
[2:33:52] my life and I know there's a Bible order
[2:33:55] I got to believe and I've got to call it
[2:33:58] done I've got to confess it and then I
[2:34:00] have to
[2:34:02] testify I'm
[2:34:04] Healed so far I've got a tingle in my
[2:34:06] finger but I'm I'm believing that the
[2:34:08] full manifestation of the healing is
[2:34:13] mine somebody said well don't everybody
[2:34:16] around this truth believe such a thing
[2:34:17] as that I don't know folks
[2:34:20] I don't
[2:34:22] know we've got more pills in our purses
[2:34:28] and I I I'm not condemning anybody I
[2:34:31] take a
[2:34:32] medication I'm not condemning anybody I
[2:34:35] just want you to know that there was a
[2:34:37] time that people who had less truth than
[2:34:40] you do and I do didn't depend on the
[2:34:45] prescription they depended on the Bible
[2:34:48] one they believe that God would I don't
[2:34:51] think that it's wise to be
[2:34:54] foolish but I think it's wise to have
[2:34:57] faith I think sometimes we have to
[2:35:00] believe well brother Brandon even told
[2:35:01] him he said you know you you see what
[2:35:03] your doctor said you believe you're
[2:35:04] healed you go back and tell your doctor
[2:35:06] let him watch let him watch he even told
[2:35:08] some people sometime just you know maybe
[2:35:09] wean yourself a little bit be careful
[2:35:12] but but your confession is I'm Healed
[2:35:14] I'm Healed I'm Healed so don't you go
[2:35:16] out of here and say well he said don't
[2:35:18] take a uh uh uh appeal I didn't say such
[2:35:22] a thing as that but I'm telling you we
[2:35:25] ought to be that New Testament Church
[2:35:27] ought to be rising
[2:35:28] up and I know that that Authority and
[2:35:31] and faith is in The Believer because of
[2:35:33] the word and I know we ought to be
[2:35:35] speaking arthritis right out of the
[2:35:38] house and somebody said well you know
[2:35:40] you just get old you're going to have do
[2:35:41] you do you have to is that a is that a
[2:35:44] that sounds like some of these sad
[2:35:46] parents who who say things like your
[2:35:48] children have to go out out in the world
[2:35:50] so they can appreciate what it means to
[2:35:52] serve the Lord the spirit of stupid has
[2:35:54] got on somebody that's what's wrong your
[2:35:57] children don't have to go out in the
[2:35:59] world and taste what Satan's got to
[2:36:01] offer to have a testimony they can get
[2:36:04] one tonight that'll keep
[2:36:06] them when he filled me with the Holy
[2:36:09] Ghost at seven years old he took the
[2:36:13] desire before I ever had a chance to
[2:36:15] feel
[2:36:16] it that God is able to do do the same
[2:36:20] for these young people
[2:36:22] tonight make them so sick I pray that
[2:36:25] when some of you tune your dial to Who's
[2:36:28] Cheating Who and who's being true I hope
[2:36:31] that song makes you so
[2:36:36] nauseated that you say I'll never feed
[2:36:39] my spiritual man on that
[2:36:42] [Music]
[2:36:45] garbage you need to just linger with him
[2:36:48] a little bit yes sir let God change your
[2:36:52] desire he'll change your
[2:36:56] desire if you'll let
[2:36:59] him thank you I was thinking that might
[2:37:01] be a little
[2:37:09] rough just stretch a little bit you've
[2:37:11] been sitting it's
[2:37:14] 8:30 pastor's got to get up in the
[2:37:17] morning and feed his congregation
[2:37:25] you've worked all
[2:37:27] week had babies and lost gallbladders
[2:37:30] and I don't know what all else has
[2:37:31] happened around
[2:37:33] here I just loved an Christine's
[2:37:38] post what I love more than that was fact
[2:37:41] she was up here praising the Lord
[2:37:42] tonight a little bit
[2:37:45] lighter God is so good I know you're
[2:37:49] tired and and you just hardly feel like
[2:37:54] grunting in faith but I want you to do
[2:37:57] this before we leave Brother David man
[2:38:00] is here he's sitting out there in the
[2:38:02] he's not out there because he's mad at
[2:38:05] me he wanted me to know he wasn't upset
[2:38:08] with worship he's been sitting out there
[2:38:11] during worship but sometimes the whole
[2:38:12] service is loud here my phone tells me
[2:38:15] all the time you you say in this
[2:38:17] atmosphere 20 minutes you you could
[2:38:19] suffer hearing
[2:38:21] loss but he has a tumor in his
[2:38:25] ear and he had a bad report this week
[2:38:28] it's not cancerous but it's
[2:38:30] growing and they're going to do an MRI
[2:38:32] to see what what it's if it's pressing
[2:38:34] and anyway the the the doctor was kind
[2:38:37] of backing out of
[2:38:39] surgery well I don't know too much about
[2:38:42] these things but seemed to me like you
[2:38:45] can't just leave the thing there to
[2:38:47] grow so that would be kind of a
[2:38:49] discouraging
[2:38:51] report no wonder he reached out and said
[2:38:54] to Benjamin can we sing this this
[2:38:56] weekend whose report will you
[2:38:58] believe oh that's like bringing your
[2:39:00] shoe
[2:39:02] box oh somebody ought to see Brother
[2:39:05] David man knitting
[2:39:08] booties positioning
[2:39:13] himself God can do
[2:39:15] [Applause]
[2:39:17] that I had a growth on the back of my
[2:39:19] neck one time and I went to we were
[2:39:21] taking the young people to byc and I was
[2:39:23] going to preach that year we stopped off
[2:39:26] at brother Bill yon's and there was a
[2:39:28] little brother there that uh had come
[2:39:30] out of the big church and was at brother
[2:39:32] Bill's there and he had a little gift in
[2:39:34] his life and and the collar of my shirt
[2:39:37] covered up that that growth on the back
[2:39:39] of my neck it was kind of tender it
[2:39:41] hadn't been giving me trouble but all of
[2:39:43] a sudden it started getting tender his
[2:39:45] name was brother Hutchins I believe
[2:39:47] maybe Hutchin son I can't remember but
[2:39:49] anyway the collar covered it up there's
[2:39:52] no way he could have seen it uh he had
[2:39:54] kind of been put out of the church
[2:39:56] because he had a gift in his life he was
[2:39:58] an old man he had no ministerial
[2:40:01] ambition you know he wasn't trying to
[2:40:02] build a following he was just trying to
[2:40:04] obey God he walked up to me JT padet was
[2:40:08] preaching that night and we were we
[2:40:10] passing through to pick up kids to fill
[2:40:12] up the van for camp and that little
[2:40:14] brother walked up to me and lay his hand
[2:40:16] on the back of my neck and and that
[2:40:18] tumor was under his hand and he cursed
[2:40:20] it in the name of Jesus Christ and you
[2:40:22] know
[2:40:24] what it
[2:40:28] went he's the
[2:40:30] same when I was traveling under the big
[2:40:33] tent I saw gers disappear I saw
[2:40:36] cancerous tumors fall off of people's
[2:40:38] faces come on I've seen some things I'm
[2:40:42] not taking somebody else's testimony or
[2:40:44] you believe this because you heard it on
[2:40:46] a tapable read in the book no I've seen
[2:40:48] that Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[2:40:50] today and
[2:40:51] forever the Lord can touch that tumor
[2:40:54] and cause it to disappear if he chooses
[2:40:56] to be a witness to that doctor he can
[2:40:58] just shrink it
[2:41:01] enough so that that he'll say well I
[2:41:04] don't know what shrinking but and and
[2:41:06] now it's going the other direction it
[2:41:08] was getting larger now it's getting
[2:41:11] smaller God knows exactly what he's
[2:41:14] doing I don't want to go through this
[2:41:16] again except you you know the testimony
[2:41:18] we gave you
[2:41:20] Sunday my daughter-in-law ended up in
[2:41:23] the in a hospital with the C-section
[2:41:25] when she was planning to have a home
[2:41:27] birth couldn't understand why things
[2:41:29] were so difficult and the doctor tells
[2:41:32] them and then comes out and tells the
[2:41:34] family somebody was looking out for you
[2:41:36] all today when we took that baby the
[2:41:39] cord was wrapped around its neck three
[2:41:41] times and if if she would have continued
[2:41:44] to push things would have been different
[2:41:47] than they are now
[2:41:50] sister Sharon sent sent a text to me and
[2:41:52] she said I know we don't understand but
[2:41:54] she said God God could have untangled
[2:41:57] that cord God could have took that cord
[2:42:00] off of that baby's neck does anybody
[2:42:01] believe God could have done that I
[2:42:03] believe he can but he didn't she said
[2:42:06] because he wanted them to
[2:42:10] know that it was him all the time that
[2:42:14] was keeping that baby from coming that
[2:42:16] way it became a testimony sir and the
[2:42:19] doctor was even shaken by it God is able
[2:42:24] sometimes he doesn't do it all the way
[2:42:26] doesn't do it the way we want but he
[2:42:28] does it in such a way that he can
[2:42:30] receive the ultimate glory is that all
[2:42:32] right brother David if God does it in
[2:42:34] such a way that he gets the ultimate
[2:42:36] Glory we're not going to tell God how to
[2:42:38] do it sister Sandy we're just going to
[2:42:41] believe that God is going to do
[2:42:44] it she's not prepared to give her
[2:42:47] testimony tonight she is a little
[2:42:49] bashful perhaps about it but you ought
[2:42:51] to hear the things God is doing for
[2:42:54] her she's seen God recently do
[2:42:57] outstanding things in her life sitting
[2:43:01] there quietly just believing just taking
[2:43:04] God at his
[2:43:06] word and seeing what God can do let's
[2:43:10] believe God tonight let's believe God
