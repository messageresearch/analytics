lord i'm yours i'm yours i'm surrendered to your will i'm surrendered to your plan jesus for my life i need your grace to walk it out but i trust you today that you've got it all in your great big

seated [Music] worthy is his name praise the lord you may be seated it's wonderful to see you in the house of the lord i don't know about you but i miss brother greeley and this is their second sunday away and he is ministering again today for his dad and uh he was asking his dad yesterday how he was feeling and he said well by faith i'm healed but my body's trying to tell me something different would you lift our elder brother greeley up to the lord and his wife and also sister joyce's dad as they are aging and uh particularly brother greeley is trying to carry on the work of the lord he pastors that small church in the hills of virginia and the largest portion of the congregation are elderly people and he labors constantly for them he's a faithful servant of the lord but as they get older there are more hospital visits and more home visits and because he is also aging it becomes difficult but god is being gracious to him and he appreciates our prayers very much so let's continue to do that i want to show you a couple of clips this morning and let me say we're happy to have all the visitors here we have quite a few of our own people still out we're very happy to have you i don't know some of you by name but you're welcome here and we just trust that you'll receive something from the lord and it is very nice to see brother reed again this week thank you for your sacrifice to come so far to be with us past hundreds of churches to be here today and appreciate that i just want you to hear our girl i want you to hear her interpreting in japanese we're very very thankful for fousey we are so very thankful for how the lord brought those sisters to us so many years ago sister emiko and her daughter fusay and now fousey is married to koya and ibuki is growing very fast they are fellowshipping as much as possible with a little group of believers in japan that has been 28 years in the making some of you remember brother dennis ballard he came here he was the most if i say that someone is eccentric you can believe it because i may be the king of that he was the most eccentric man i've ever met in my life but he had the most sincere burden for japan he had married a japanese woman after the war and it was his desire that god send a salvation message and the message of the hour to japan and uh he came here unannounced from anchorage alaska and we had a few days of fellowship with him and on the last day he slid a check across the table to me and kept his fingers on one end of the check i knew there were some strings attached glanced down at the check and it was for one hundred thousand dollars the largest check i'd ever seen in my life at that time and uh he said if you will leave now and stay 360 days in japan preaching jesus and introducing this message this check is yours we will take care of your expenses while you're there and your plane ticket to get there and then this will be your gift because we want to see god well those were the early 90s and god was doing amazing things here and as much as i loved asia and had a heart already for the asian people having been to uh philippines and korea i didn't think that that was the call that god was placing on my life at that time and he we parted very friendly he he just said well then we've got to pray that god will raise up someone well years later the lord has done that and uh it was not our church that put that together it was through some missionary efforts of brother tim pruitt etc but our sister fousey and sister uh and emiko have been a great blessing in that congregation and that this week uh the pastor pastor fed reached out and he wrote a little note and he said we are also thankful for you being one of the instruments in paving the way for the message to take root here in japan and they recognize that this church had some help in that because we baptized a couple of the first believers in the nation so they asked that i would greet their new year service and i did that and we're not you're not it's 12 minutes long we're not going to play all of it i just want you to hear our girl interpreting give him just a little of it he traveled many miles turn it way up to visit me [Music] his brother most importantly and his great a burden [Applause] god bless them and they sent us a clip back and it's just about three or four seconds long i think so this [Music] is in that great [Music] oh thank you lord and they're growing god is adding to their numbers and we are thankful to hear there are a few foreign workers among them from philippines and other places but there are there are precious uh japanese people who are coming to the lord and we're very very thrilled to have even the smallest part in that and uh when fousey began to come so often she just became a part of our family didn't she and you people have been so uh hospitable and had them in your home and i miss them and i hope that they can come back and if not we'll have to go to japan and see them before too long isn't the lord good happy new year to all of you and uh we are excited about what the lord has for us he's been good to us this year the past year 2021 it was not without challenge but god's grace has been sufficient you believe that today is hawk's birthday he came up and prayed and we should have mentioned it then but we didn't mention it we spared him he is at a big one today not as big as some pretty big for a young man he turned 40 today i told him this morning in a text don't worry about it they tell me that 40 is the new 30. and he said i'm claiming that i didn't want to be too exaggerated you know i could have said that 40 is the new 25 but i wasn't feeling that that early in the morning so hawk we want to say happy birthday to you and tell you we appreciate you and love you [Applause] i don't see tiffany this morning but her birthday is tomorrow and we want to wish her a happy birthday she's possibly streaming this service and then on a tuesday of this week is our second son joshua rivers birthday he will be back with us uh on tuesday he flies home and will be in service tuesday night so we'll try to remember to embarrass him then but anyway are there any other birthdays or anniversaries anything we miss this morning before we get ready for the word all right i want to sing this song and then we're going to preach about three hours and get the new year all inaugurated and ready i want you to help me sing this actually born to serve the lord i know that uh my style of music is not maybe yours but mine's the best i grew up with happy goodmans i don't know who you all are growing up with but anyway i can't keep up with some of them but i've discovered a couple of new artists that i really enjoy one is uh a young lady by the name of charity gail how many of you are familiar with her music any of you she's a pentecostal girl i pray that god will keep her and protect her and watch over her in that vicious industry of christian music it's vicious but she has got a a tone and a touch that really speaks to my heart sometime she sings a song i speak jesus over every fear over every anxiety i need that sometime don't you we have a pentecostal man that we know of who's a doctor in mississippi and he took covet and he had quite a battle there for a few days and he said he was reaching for something that would help him in the middle of that he was trying to praise his way out and touch god for some victory and and he discovered that song and he said i just played it over and over again and i could feel that thing turning loose of my body there's power in that precious name but this is my old style from the dust of the earth my god created man his breath made man a living soul [Music] for god so loved this world that he gave his only son had night and that is why i love him so sing with me i was made in his likeness created in his image [Music] [Music] oh i cannot deny him i must always walk beside him for i i was born to serve the lord [Music] my hands they were made so i could help my neighbor my eyes were made to read god's word and my feet oh they were made that i could walk in his footsteps my body is the temple of the lord if you know where you were born to serve him sing i was made in his likeness i was created in his image i oh i was born to serve the lord oh i cannot deny him i must always walk beside him for i oh i was born to serve the lord sing this with me if you will from the dust from the dust of the earth my god created man but it took god's breath to make man a living soul for god so loved this world that he gave his only son and that oh that is why i love him soul i was made in his likeness i was made in his likeness i was created in his image for i oh i was born to serve the lord [Music] oh i cannot deny him i must always walk beside him for i before i was born we're going to the word why don't you stand up and help us sing the last chorus and then we'll go right to scripture for i was made in his likeness i was created in his image you were fearfully and wondrously created in his image i was born to serve the lord [Music] oh and i

yesterday if you're living in the past if you're living in yesterday i didn't say last year i said if you're living in yesterday yesterday ended last night or you might say this morning if you're going by the rising of the sun it's over with and finished and done you'll never be able to go back and live yesterday again but you've got the rest of the day today to live right to do right to be obedient to the voice of the holy spirit if you believe that say amen i forget those things which are behind i reach forward to the things which are before and i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus i want to read psalms 31 verse 15 and 16. if you get a friday text from me and you took time to read it this week you've already read these verses my times are in thy hand i want to read it again my times are in thy hand deliver me from the hand of mine enemies and from them that persecute me make thy face to shine upon thy servant save me for thy mercy sake my times are in thy hand deliver me from the hand of mine enemies and from them that persecute me make thy face to shine upon thy servant and save me for thy mercy's sake let's pray together would you lord jesus we thank you that you are in our midst we're thankful that you woke us up this morning in our right mind and you were the first thought in my mind and in my heart when i woke up this morning and every time i woke up through the night it was you that came it was it was a thought of your goodness that flooded my mind and i began like so many have done over these past few days counting my blessings lord we could never praise you enough we could never thank you enough for what you mean to us today you are jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever you change not your compassions they fail not your mercies are everlasting you are a refuge to your people in the time of storm we are gathered today lord to be encouraged by your word corrected by your word redirected by your word whatever it is that we have need of lord let your word speak to that today give us ears to hear give us a heart to understand lord let us each one feel our responsibility to pull on the gifts of god and make this time in your word as beneficial as possible because it's strength to us and lord we need that strength that only your word can provide we take authority over every foul spirit of the enemy and we declare in the name of the lord jesus christ you are already defeated you will not be allowed to hinder the people of god from eating at the lord's table today so we adjure you in the name of jesus to take your flight even now and we ask oh god that your perfect will will be accomplished and ministered in the marvelous name of the lord jesus christ yeshua our messiah amen and the church said you may be seated i want to preach this morning if i had a little title i would call it not by luck chance or happenstance not by luck chance or happenstance matter what 2021 brought us in our individual lives we know that we can never go back and relive it we are now on day two of 2022 that means that we are exceeding a 2-2-2 some of us have been watching 2-2-2's for a long time i could stand here for two hours or more and talk about the two twos of the bible and the two two twos of the bible and some of the amazing places where these things come together but when we were changing the hebrew calendar earlier in the fall of last year we looked at some of the things that go along with the hebrew year 5782 and then we look for a bit at some of the two two twos of the bible there were a couple of them that were highlighted in the spirit and i want to just remind you of them very quickly and the ladies don't have them up there but i feel that they can probably find them but one of the ones that the lord was dealing with me about in the fall was acts chapter 2 verse 22. you've got a bible there you can look it up and read it for yourself but it says ye men of israel hear these words jesus of nazareth a man approved of god among you by miracles and wonders and signs this is the only place in the entire bible where all three of these manifestations of god's glory appear in the same verse there will be other places where signs and wonders appear there may be other scriptures where miracles and signs appear but this is the only scripture in the bible where all three of these demonstrations of god's glory appear this is how jesus manifested who he was by miracles by wonders and by signs which god did by him in the midst of you as ye yourselves also know when i found that in the fall i said lord that's what i'm claiming for 222 for 2022 i'm claiming god that you will once again manifest your glory this time in a mini-membered bride this time in a man-child company not one man child but a company of men child men children a man child company that you will come in your great wisdom and perform by your glory miracles and wonders and signs and do it in the lives of your children your sons your bride in these last days so i've been praying into that now since about the first part of september and i'm believing that god is doing it and that it will soon be on the surface and you'll begin to see god using you in miracles and signs and wonders now if you were here last sunday you saw a miracle we only have a small part in that but we all have prayed and believed god and we know that we had a man here who was as close to being resurrected from the dead just about as you can get sent home to die and uh given just really a few days to a week and now two months later he sat in this service and gave testimony of the goodness of the lord and this sunday got in the vehicle rode all the way to lagrange an hour away and is preaching to his congregation that's the goodness of the lord if if god should take him home tomorrow that is still the goodness of the lord and what i've been saying to people who have asked different questions i have been saying over and over again you don't have to be sick to die you don't even have to be sick to die and there's no reason if god decides that he's going to call his servant home why not heal him why not go ahead and glorify his name in his body then if he leaves him here for years to carry on the gospel the miracle is profound but if he should call him home the miracle is still profound god has undertook in his life and i'm so thankful that all the glory belongs to god he planned it that way it was not until the doctor said the last time there is nothing else that we can do the vowel is perforated it has spilled its waste into an open cavity in his abdomen there's nothing that we can do he would not survive the surgery we're sending him home under hospice care and jesus passed by and said not yet not yet so i'm asking the lord for more miracles and wonders and signs the holy ghost spoke here one time years ago and he said i'm going to make my children the miracles and the signs and the wonders he's going to do such a work in us that only he could receive the glory for how many of you think that sounds all right [Music] i feel like this is a little loud somewhere i don't know where if it's out there if it's up here i feel like it needs just a little bit of adjusting so no matter what we've been through we have to reach for what's ahead and we have to do that in a mindset we know about how that negative stuff works we've got to do that in a mindset and we may have to tell ourselves over and over again get out of the past don't wallow around in yesterday's stuff come on now i want to say always i want you to understand we are not trying to take away from what you've been through you have legitimately been through some stuff you have walked through some darkness you have had trials you have had battles you have had wars just like i have but the truth is we're here today by the grace of god he has proven that he's going to help his people get through this and we stand here today knowing that we couldn't have made it without him how many of you know you could not be where you are without the goodness of the lord never made it you might be a somewhere with a hangover you might be somewhere coming down off of a high this morning but instead you are joined together with the saints to worship the name of the lord jesus christ all of that by grace and so we are reaching ahead and we are pressing forward to everything that god has for us this year in the message shalom he preached this message multiple times brother branham but in 1964 in phoenix january the 19th paragraph 184 he said god stands on the promised word for each new year where are you standing god where are you at today lord where might we find you if we went looking for you today i'll tell you where he is he's standing on the promised word for 2022. whatever in his mind he has seen he has purpose he has planned for 2022. that's what he's standing on today and i want you to know when god takes his stand on his word you and i should do the same thing because then we come into agreement with god's word and that loses to us the benefit and the blessing that's underneath that promise brother brannon went on to say he stands on it this year to fulfill what he has got promised for this year whatever it is i want to be right in the center of his will in the future like they did i wonder if anybody can say amen when we read just a moment ago psalm 31 15 it said my times plural are in thy hand singular i want you to know i know what hand he's holding my times only one hand times plural hand singular i'm not over here on the left hand the one he uses to wipe his brow but i'm being held over here in the right hand the right hand of his power and his authority the psalmist said my times are in thy hand he needed deliverance and he knew that god had already determined the day and the hour of his deliverance so he said lord my times my healings my deliverances my freedoms my breakthroughs my recoveries all my restitutions my restorations all that i have need of my down setting and my uprising all that i'm going to go through the rest of my life you're holding it in your right hand the hand of power and the hand of authority it's going to be all right and even though i'm persecuted and even though i have enemies and even though i suffer some things down here i know where my times are being held they're being held in the hand of the lord do you know how you're going to get through 2022 not by luck not by chance not by happenstance that's how you're not going to make it through would you give me the definition of luck you know i hear christian people sometimes talking about being lucky that's wrong that's not something that ought to come out of your mouth luck is chance god doesn't operate by chance he operates operates by predetermined purpose and plan luck is a force that brings good fortune or adversity the events or circumstances that operate for or against an individual i've heard christian people say i've had an unlucky year i've heard christian people part one another say good luck to you let me tell you something i don't need your wish of luck i need you to pray for me that i don't miss the timing of the lord in my life i need your prayer i don't need your your wishes of of good luck or best luck i need you to pray that i can walk in the center of god's will in 2022 because we're going to make it by grace we're going to make it by his word but it's not going to be by luck chance or happenstance i want you to give me the definition of chance if you will the assumed impersonal purposeless determiner i didn't make this up this is webster the gospel according to webster the assumed impersonal purposeless determiner of unaccountable happenings anybody else confused somebody said how did you all come to me it was just by chance well let me tell you what chance he is how did you meet your wife well it just was by chance how'd you get the job you got just by chance well let me tell you what who chance is chance is the assumed impersonal purposeless determiner of unaccountable happenings to me that's just a big fat zero it doesn't mean anything how many of you are glad you're not living by chance you're not living by the draw the lucky draw you're living by a plan that god has laid out for our lives before we ever showed up here on this planet the good and the bad and the ugly now somebody said the whole world is churning trying to determine why bad things happen to good people i'm telling you this god is sovereign god has a plan if you'll just hold on to him you'll find out before it's over that he didn't forsake you he didn't forget you you didn't fall out of his love you didn't fall out of his care he allowed these things to come your way because he's bringing you to a higher glory he's bringing you to a place where you can meet him where he stands the prophet said he stands today on the promised word for this year and god wants you to be able to meet him there you can't meet god in 2022 if you're still living in 2021 you can't meet god for what he wants to do for us this year if you're still living in 1950 you've got to catch up and you the reason why we get behind and we don't catch up is we're still trying to go and sort out all the things that happened to us why did that happen well why did that happen what if i'd done this just like we've heard and i've mentioned it more than one time with so many people dying this year not just of covet but of all kinds of things and you hear people say things and look grief is horrible and losing somebody you love is wretched and none of us want to walk through that ever again because most of us have walked through it already in our lives but the reality is we will if jesus tarries we've got another casket to follow there's no doubt in my mind about it but as you have seen it this year you hear people even god's people even people who have the message that we have saying things like if i could have just got him to a better hospital if i could have just got him to a better doctor if they would have just let him take hydroxychlorquin if i could have just got him a better treatment if i could have got her on vitamin d a little earlier come on now you cannot have it both ways you're trying to take something out of god's hands and put it in the hands of men and when we trust ourselves to the hands of men we're going to get failed every time the bible said there was a prophet named asa who trusted the lord all of his days and in his old age a king and in his old age he got diseased in his feet and he leaned on the arms of flesh and died why because he changed his program at the end he had always went to god and god had always moved on his behalf but when he decided this time i'm going to see what man can do for me let me tell you something i appreciate doctors i appreciate those smarter than i am but i want you to know your life your very existence your tomorrow your today is not in the hands of educated men it's not in the hands of a good hospital it's not in the hands of a good doctor your life is in the hands of a good god he may not you say well i'm going through some stuff that's not good you may be 100 telling it just like it is you may be going through something that's not good at all but i'll tell you what the bible said he works all things for the good it didn't say all things that happened to us are good haven't you preached this before i have i just never called it not by luck chance or happenstance so can you give me the definition of happenstance i want to make sure we know what we're not depending on to get us through a circumstance especially that is due to chance happenstance is a circumstance especially that is due to chance can you take us back and show us what chance is because i've already forgot the assumed impersonal purposeless determiner of uncountable happenings look can you take us back to luck because i've already forgot what luck is luck is a force that brings good fortune or adversity the events or circumstances that operate for or against an individual brother branham said there's only two forces in all the earth not god the devil and lady luck not god the devil and chance or god the devil and champion and happenstance i'm going to be tongue-tied not at all but god and evil good and evil darkness and light and your hands if you've committed it so your life is in the hands of the lord he is the holder of your future he's the one who has your tomorrow in his hand he had your yesterday in his hand he knows exactly you know we we're we're we don't know we don't know how many variants are coming we don't know how many more viruses are coming we don't know what is going to fall on this earth the prophet of god talked about germ warfare being used in the end time who knows what's coming we have no way of predicting the future but what we do know is there's a great god that's got the future in his hands in a message god's gifts always find their places 63 paragraph 77 he said when you realize what we are doing here where did we come from or what business we got here got being here we wasn't put here just by chance now i know you've got to make it through the grammar to get to the meat we wasn't put here just by chance we were put here for a purpose and we must serve that purpose we're not serving luck we're not serving chance we're not serving happenstance we're serving a god-ordained purpose for our life but still we are back on the basis of free moral agency where we can serve it or reject it just like adam did in the beginning now i appreciate brother branham bringing the balance here because you are not a robot and you are not being forced to walk in a plan that you don't want nothing to do with you've got to make a choice but i can tell you right now the only success that we can have in this life is to cooperate with what god's got for us and every time we start kicking against those pricks we pay the price for it again and again and again can you say amen would you get with me this morning because i i think you need to hear some of this in a message things that are to be paragraph 31 this is so rich i hope you'll give it your undivided attention even if you don't listen to my comments i pray you'll hear what he said you were all pre-planned by god nothing happens by chance with god he knows all about it it's all pre-planned planned for many generations back so that you could be here tonight do you hear what he's saying even your gathering here this morning was planned of god you may have got up this morning not sure where you would be here or not but i want you to know god already knew whether you'd make it or not he knew he already knew he already had it a part of his plan if it wasn't his plan you ain't here i'm just going to talk like brother branham here a little while you ain't here if he hadn't already seen it planned it allowed it you wouldn't be sitting here this morning so we must understand there's a reason for us being gathered together the way we are today it's a part of a pre-plan that god has laid for our lives let's read on he said just think that you at one time i'll repeat this again you at one time was in your father in the gene of your father now he didn't know you at that time neither did you know him at that time you were just a seed a gene in him you didn't have any kind of relationship or fellowship with your father he goes on but you see then you were put in the bedding ground in the womb of mother through holy wedlock and then you become a person expressed in the image like your father then there's fellowship there can't be fellowship until the gene is expressed but when the gene of life is expressed it comes forth in the image of the father who provided it and in that moment there is a bonding that takes place between a baby and a dad or a baby and a mother even though a portion of that baby was in mom as a as a seed i mean as an egg and a portion of that baby was in dead as a gene or as a seed and yet they didn't know one another you didn't know the personality that that baby would have you didn't know exactly how it would look even your ultrasound couldn't show you exactly how wonderful and amazing that baby was going to look when it was born you knew that you had contributed your part but there was no bonding no fellowship no relationship and this is such a powerful truth because as we go on we find out that we were with god even in god in the beginning we didn't know him we had not yet had fellowship with him we have no recollection of being there until we begin to have fellowship with him when we begin to have fellowship with him we recognize hey this is right this is somehow familiar i've experienced something like this before i can't quite put my finger on it but i feel like i've been here before the world calls it deja vu but we understand that sometimes what we are experiencing are memories of a time before we had an expression and without an expression we had not yet had fellowship with god but in the hour that we were expressed he began to woo us into a place of fellowship and it doesn't feel strange once we get in papa's arms we don't feel alone anymore and like a stranger anymore we feel like we belong when we know who we are in christ we feel like we belong and we feel like we're where we've always been and some of that is a memory of what it was like before we ever came to this earth that's why when you see the new city it's not going to be as big of a shock as you may think it is there's going to be elements of your eternity that are all so familiar because we know that even memories can be transferred through the gene oh it's very true we learn it we've researched it we talked about it when we were doing some stuff on the brain you are born with a memory that comes some from egg and some from seed you just don't know anything about it and may never you may live your whole life and never be able to connect with that until you get in the presence of the lord when you get in the presence of the lord and you start singing like gaither wrote feeling at home in the presence of jesus how is it that the first time you get in his presence you feel like you've always been there it's new but it's old it's strange but it's familiar all at the same time here's the reason why let's read on some of you are looking at me very odd let me see if i can look right back out audit you what do you mean by that now the only way that you can be a son a daughter of god because you have to have to have eternal life and there's only one form of eternal life and that's god's life only one form of eternal life that was god there there to be a son of god you had to be in him always you really believe that the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in god not your natural gene life that was in your dad your spiritual gene life was in god the father before there was even a molecule oh you're older than you look because you were in your father before a molecule was ever created how many of you know we don't know how far back that was that could have possibly been millions of years not just the six thousand years we know of creation from the bible but we understand that before before genesis 1 took place there were some things that had already happened in god's creation do you understand that there were creatures who lived in that time period that didn't make it to genesis 1 and people find the bones and the remainders and the fossils and the archaeologists dig these kinds of relics up and they try to find a place to put them in history and they say well they must be billions of years old we know that the earth as we know it it's exactly right at 6 000 years old but there was an existence before genesis 1 and we don't know exactly what that was like but we know that whatever it was it was a part of god's original creation we know by what the scripture said there were molecules even civilizations of some kind of organization existed before the great deluge we don't know exactly what all that looked like but in order for there to have been creation then there had to be molecules so we could probably say that molecules are millions of years maybe billions of years and yet you were in god before a molecule had ever been created there is a part of you that is older than you come on now this was a great plan and you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in god as a son of god now let's read on now you're expressed after his word has come in you he's talking about the spiritual expression of the spiritual gene to light up this age what is my purpose why am i here why was i born you may not like it because i'm not going to tell you that anybody in this room can be the president of the united states because you can't not every person in here no this is a philosophy of humanism that keeps telling people over and over again you can be anything you want to be not necessarily because god has a plan if you want to be more accurate you should say you can be almost anything that you desire to be as long as it's part of god's plan right somebody said well that just limits us oh no you have not i have not scratched the surface of what we were created to be to express in the last of the last days i don't want to i don't want to throw anybody off who may have never heard this before but the prophet uses words like amateur gods and he used his word like messiahs i don't think i've been walking in that lately so i'm just scratching the surface of expressing what i was created to express so you think all this happened by luck and chance and happenstance you think the earth as we know it is here because the assumed impersonal purposeless determiner of unaccountable happenings i believe in the great bang big bang don't you i believe in them yes sir i believe in the big bang with all my heart god spoke bang boom i don't know what it sounded like but all i know is that he spoke and all of exists everything began to move into place to create what it was that he was speaking it may have sounded like a sonic boom there may have been no words in what he spoke that day but everything that was there from from nothing he created everything that we see none of it by chance none of it by luck none of it by happenstance all by a divine creator with a divine order a god who knew it all and it ashamed that we make so many decisions on our own until we finally come to god and then we start asking him what he thinks about things how many troubles have we had and trials have we gone through because we did the choosing instead of yielding to god finding his will and timing we've paid a price folks that we didn't really have to pay somebody said what do you think about that what did that your free will your free choice you can't go back and undo that any more than you can undo anything else that's in your past but what you can do is determine from this day forward i will not move forward without i know god's will the prophet prophesied that there would be a thus saith the lord bride who would emerge in the last days she would not do anything unless she had the say of the lord every time she moved it would be thus saith the lord when she spoke it would be thus saith the lord not one prophet again we've had that not one prophet again but a prophetic people a prophetic bride a remnant of sons and daughters a manchild company that would emerge with that kind of power and authority in their life and that's what god's been working on all throughout history he said now you're expressed after his word has come in you to light up this age that's your purpose your purpose is to light up this age this is the darkest age ever known in the histories of man there's never been a darker day than the church age of laodicea it's so bad it's almost a total eclipse the light has almost been completely erased from the earth you are living in the last sliver of light for this planet does that sound like doom and gloom it sounds like reality the earth is destroying itself and i'm not talking about global warming i'm talking about a society that keeps rejecting god and rejecting god and rejecting god and rejecting god's word and because of that there's just a sliver of light the real light is in the bride you are here in this hour to light up this age and when you leave here by resurrection there will be no light left there will be a time of great tribulation jacob's sorrow tribulation like the world is never ever known before you'll be safe in a honeymoon in a millennium in a place where jesus is preparing and getting things ready for you and i you don't believe that do you i do with every fiber of my being in fact i think i've i think somehow i've been there in some form and i'm getting ready to go back there i think i'll understand it a whole lot better this time around don't you because the full expression has taken place he said you god's life in you because you're a son or a daughter of god therefore you get what i mean and he asked that as a question with a question mark therefore you get what i mean and the congregation says good good good good see and he goes on you are now made you're sitting in this church tonight because your duty is to express god to this nation and this people and this neighborhood where you associate wherever you are god knew that you would be here because you have to be one of his genes or his attributes let's go on you had to be if you ever if you've got eternal life then it always was eternal life and god before there was a foundation world knew that you would be here let me tell you something he not only knew that you would be expressed in the earth but he knew the precise moment somebody said i just can't i just can't get this i just can't fathom anything well let me just get real plain here this election this predestination this purpose is something that's demonstrated in the earth every day of the year don't you see the articles that come out on january the 1st they always the hospitals snap a picture of the first baby born in 2022 already seen them and they weren't the only ones or just happened to be the first ones there may have been hundreds of babies born right here in this area on the first day of 2022 well let me tell you something in order for that baby to show up there was a whole lot of election that had to take place not by chance i want you to know there was a seed that had to get to that egg and it came by the billions had billions of cousins and it had a journey to swim i'm not trying to be too plain this morning but i tell you i think it's one of the most outstanding examples of election because one of them was ordained to make it all the way somebody said what about the rest they didn't make it it was not by selective order it wasn't a battle to the fittest it was god chose one he made it all the way amen he merged himself according to biology he merged himself with an egg and in doing so he could no longer claim his own identity because that moment that that egg was fertilized by that seed in that moment it became a new creation it was no longer an egg it was no longer a seed the seed joined itself with the egg and a new creation was formed in your mother's belly one that had not been there before because that fertilized egg is now an embryo and it is now a life amen and it now has a full set of chromosomes and it now has everything it needs to succeed in life come on and in order for it to get there and to accomplish that it had to get there when all the others couldn't make it one made it when the earth was filling up with nations god said i'll help them all if they'll trust the god of israel but israel is mine i'll be good to all the nations of the world but i'll only be good to them through the one that i have chosen i have chosen israel and by israel i will bless the other nations of the world so don't you doubt for one minute that god had a plan to get you here you were known of god and fashioned in the mind of god to be here to hear the word of the hour and to be a light to your age and even in our backslidden condition sometimes he still has a purpose and a plan for us and he who's us and draws us and he directs us see i remember a time and you say well brother shelly there's no long-lasting fruit that came out of it i want you to know that's a dirty lie i remember a time that a brother greely come along and he wanted to buy the old church van help us out and he bought the old church van o white church van and it had an eagle on it right and i think it said jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever and brother greeley drives that van to a builder's association meeting and there's a renegade from california who's here to laytown with a cousin who's at that same builders association meeting and his name was steve valenti he sees that eagle and it reminds him of something from his past where a guy that he used to ride in the truck with had been listening to tapes of brother branham and he'd even tried to go to a church where this message was being preached but they didn't seem to be able to find a way to fit in and click in but for a while he embraced that word with everything that he had that wasn't by luck that wasn't by chance that wasn't by happenstance you say brother shelly where is that family i know exactly where they are they're on the west coast and they better be holding on for their life but i know there's a daughter here who married a young man from here who's raising some children here and i want you to know god loved kendra valenti enough that he allowed that meeting to take place that day brother greeley driving that van with an eagle on it brother see seeing that eagle and said hey there must be something to that they strike up a conversation and that family worships with us here for years now are they all still here they're not but god let us have a kendra and a milli and a nora out of that arrangement and i want you to know seed have been planted for the rest of that family and god doesn't lose anybody that belongs to him if you're with me you ought to say man that did not happen by luck it didn't happen by chance it didn't happen by happenstance it happened in the time and the order of a living god so you just go tell people party on toast on and make the best of your life while you can because if you are a part of that seed of god that's going to be expressed in the earth you will never outrun your destiny you will never outrun the god who saw you in the beginning you'll never be able to outrun the gene of his life that he deposited in you before you ever came to this earth you can't get away from that i'm losing my voice but you need to hear what i have to say before i close this morning i don't know what to you know we don't know what the rest looks like but i know where seed's been planted and i know that wasn't by mistake we could go around this room uh skip yantis we could go around this room because there was a little lady named betty pilkington that walked down to a mailbox to see her mail and you came by in your vehicle is that right was it you you came by in your vehicle you saw sister betty there and you thought oh she reminds me of uh of the sisters in the church that i come out of in texas you end up at some point striking a conversation with that lady say it go ahead right that's right because that's where she was living that was her place at the time where the curries live now and the next thing we know we're down there under the tabernacle having service and here comes this dark van i said where do you want to tell this story you're bringing up memory bad memory too look i can't help it it saddens me that the valentines aren't with us this morning but i can't deny what god did there are things that have happened in the antis family that sadden us we're not bringing it up because we want to hurt anybody's feelings we're bringing it up to say god never yes what the devil meant for evil what joseph's brothers meant to destroy him god chose it to promote him find me some spray would you benjamin pretty please i'm not finished they come riding down that hill i thought there was some under here open the doors of that van here out got out one hear god i don't know hear god and another here got out another here got out another you're gonna ah that's a lot of youngins sister teresa said to me one day sad times she said brother shelly i've probably caused you our family has probably caused you more heartache than any family you've ever worked with in your i don't even know i don't even remember that i don't even know that wasn't true then it's not true now that's not open there's been hard times but we made them through together you win me where are you at we've got visitors here they will really think we're just off our rockers might as well find out your first visit you mean a manly man like you you can't take the lid off of that thing it's the plastic it's supposed to be perforated but i can never get the right place i don't want to roll this around in my mouth too much and you hear it on the mic i think you've done surgery thank you so much yes i'm gonna keep it oh one time somebody took that out of my hand after i sprayed they said not for topic for topical use only not to be ingested and they said what are you putting in god had a purpose and he had a plan he put a woman in a mailbox he put a man in need coming by at just the right time that brought a family to us that has blessed us far more than they have ever caused me any problems ashley needed a husband i mean it wasn't like she was an old mate or anything but god saw one day she would need a husband for the life of me i don't know why he chose david he had to get david here he had to get sister betty at the mailbox he had to get brother skip by at just the right time come on folks i'm not telling you anything you don't know charity needed a husband we could go right down the line and we could say and and i don't want to bring this in here and and and do it in a wrong way i want to do it because it just keeps coming to my mind they've been a blessing valenti's blessed my life this this yantas graves family has blessed my life they blessed us so much this week sister teresa brother skip brother robert these boys took their week off work to come and help benjamin and i who in my family who are challenged we don't know how to lay a board or hardly nail a board or whatever it's not it's not the training that we have we have none they came in on their week off and they have worked from early in the day to late in the night to get that accomplished they did it day after day after day after day that's not the only blessing i'm just saying the lord knew that one day that we would need to put that place together for benjamin to start his life with a new wife who he met at youth camp put us there at just the right time oh why don't you tell your story and then come back and tell me you don't know how you're going to make it through 2022 you're going to make it the same way you've always made it depending on the lord knowing that he will lead us if we lean on him [Applause] oh could i go on and i'll as soon as i get out of here i'll remember all the stories i wished i would have told all the connections that i used to would have told boy now my mind is reeling has everything that has happened with us been good and wonderful and glorious and no there's been hardship and heartache there's been joy and tears but none of it took god by surprise he has used it to build us to mold us to make us listen god hates divorce it's not god's plan but i realize that i am in a different position in my life today because of a voice that spoke to me and said your mom and dad are going to divorce i wasn't even five years old you're going to have some tough times but you're going to get through it and because you do there's going to be other young people that come to trust the lord because i trust me because i am going to bring you through this the bible tells us it was not so from the beginning i know that it wasn't god's perfect plan but i know that god saw it before he ever drew my mom and dad together he knew exactly what would drive them apart and he knew it enough to forewarn me nearly two years before it took place what was about to happen is just a very small toddler he spoke to me to prepare my heart because it was a part of his great big plan did it hurt and were there probably yes did you have troubles if you had some stuff so although none of these things are pleasant in themselves they keep bringing us closer and closer and closer to being fully surrendered to what god has for our lives oh hallelujah let's go on to the next paragraph and when the word or the water the washing of the water the word fell upon you it was expressed in a being now you have fellowship with your father god just as you have with your earthly father see let's keep going you are citizens of the king not citizens but your children sons and daughters of the living god if it be that the eternal life dwells in you now then if it was jesus was the fullness of god manifested he was the fullness of the godhead bodily keep going therefore when he came to the earth and was manifested in flesh you were here listen you were here in him then you believe that austin you were in him then because he was the word if you are a part of that word you always were a part of that word and therefore when that word was expressed in flesh you were identified in him in that word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us the word was made flesh what paragraph are we at can you tell me therefore you walked with him when you were in him when he was on earth you suffered with him and you died with him and you was buried with him and now you are risen with him i want to make sure you're hearing me you were risen with him and manifested attributes of god where are you at this morning setting shout that out again setting in heavenly places you thought you were just sitting in same old same old where you sit every sunday but the word says you are setting in heavenly places let's go on already raised resurrected to new life and setting in heavenly places in christ jesus oh that means so much nowadays church that means so much to us to see our self positionally placed in jesus christ now paragraph 33 the last one now if we are those attributes of god we cannot live by creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must read it for me we must live by the word because the bride is a part of the bridegroom like any wife is a part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and what is that word bride the manifestation of this hour the bride not a creed or a denomination but a living oracle of god an expression of god's spoken word a living oracle of god a living attribute of god displaying to the world the attributes of god on your worst day we got to go on your worst day on your grumpy day chad i don't know why you came to my mind i talked to your boys i said to him your dad feeling any better no he wasn't feeling any better on the day he was grumpy i said your dad feeling any better yes sir he's feeling better he was grumpy now what would you think even on your grumpy day even on your bed head day bad hair day when you're at your worst when you're so rotten you stink your attitude's foul you've grumbled more than you praised you are still a living attribute of god he cannot lose you he will not lose you he will chase you he will pursue you he will wrap his arms around you until you surrender again to the life that he has chosen for you one that is not by luck not by chance not by happenstance but one that has a plan it has a purpose the manifestation of this hour expressed in this hour that we are now living in the same message things that are to be paragraph 41 it is 111. i got a little bit of time but i'm going to hurry i don't believe that a person just happened to be here by chance now just think when you come to the world everything had to be for prepared for you or pre-prepared rather for you do you understand that you are an amazing combination of your mom and dad you would have never been who you were i know some of you have said probably all four of mine at some point or another i wish so and so was my mama i wish so and so was my dad but don't ever let me hear you saying i might have to cut you off because there's probably been times when you was costing so much i wish so and so was your mom and your daddy too but you are what you are because you are a perfect combination genetically of your mom and dad you would not have been the same with another dad you would have not been the same without another mother god had to draw you together your parents together at just the right time and your mother and dad provided for you the body that you were going to live in but it was god who determined the living spirit that was going in you and he was going to put that in only you you didn't catch it because somebody else lost it somebody else died and didn't need it you got it because it was foreordained a portion of god's spirit for ordained for you before the world was ever formed he said i don't hardly understand that how that we could think that a god could prepare all these good things for us we could not put our trust in him that's what i want to talk about i wanted you to know you can trust him i want to tell somebody you can trust him i'm going to be real real plain on the other end of kendra there's a young man that could have had a wrong wife all of us could have had the wrong wife so he's no exception but a particular example of my point he could have had a wrong wife why are y'all looking at me like you feel sorry for him if this embarrasses him he ain't realize what he got i think you better know milly wouldn't be millie nor it wouldn't be nora if ben would have had another wife you think it don't matter it does matter he's got a brother that could have had a wrong wife but god but god but god sometimes the young people kid each other about how many they liked before they got to the one they got what does that matter as long as they weren't trying them all on for size when you're when you're a certain age you think you like something you you pick something out you pick somebody out you think that's the one i want to be with in a few few months or even a year so down the road you look back and you think what in the world was i thinking as i go through things sometimes i find pictures of girls that liked me and i thought i liked them and i didn't get them all tore up before i married i'll be digging through a box and i find them i don't even linger i just rip it up as fast as i can some of them ask me to be friends on facebook i say no i don't even want to be your friend just one glance i'm not talking about physical just one glance makes me so thankful to god that he spared me brought me the wife that he wanted me to have come on now it wasn't that i was such a catch that i was attracting so many it's that i was a target and satan wanted me to miss just like he wants you to miss there's a mother-in-law sitting back there one time that came to me and said brother jelly can you do anything with him i couldn't then and i can't do much with him now but i know this god had a wife for him sitting here this morning and three children to raise in the service of the lord with a good hearts good hearts and great personalities and good respect and anything could have happened had they not waited to know that they had gotten a hold of the right one i don't want to drag it up but boy it's on my mind i'm feeling old he's the only person in this room that ever answered a question like this because he there was this old gal that had her hooks on him why are you all so quiet i'm talking about chad there was this old girl that had her hooks on him [Music] i had a name for her and i can't say it because olivia don't lie for me to say this word it's not a curse word she just don't like hearing and i said this is not going to work this is not going to work this is never going to work this can't be right this girl's got a spirit on her there's no way in the world this would ever work i want you to tell me right now what i can do to help get this thing split now i realize the more i talk the more like a cult we'll we're gonna sound just hit me pretty hard i said what is it gonna take for you to get her out of your mind and out of your heart and he reached in his pocket and pulled out his wallet and laid it on the table and he said i guess you're gonna have to paddle me he was in school the pastor let me just say as a pastor i don't go around paddling people and for those of you who feel sorry i feel all that old unsanctified mercy coming up now and everybody feels sorry for him we could have paddled him every day of school and never caught up with all he deserved so don't you think he just looked up he said i think you're going to have to paddle me i said all right let's let's get ready and i did and guess what i beat him right out of her heart no that's not the way it works he made a conscious decision that day i better wait for god's choice for me come on and he did how many years later anniversary how many years you've been married they've been so engrossed in the story it's like popcorn huh 22 years three amazing godly gifted children that wouldn't be here today had that old got her claws on him and what did you do i prayed for her that god would help her she's been through several sins and i still pray for her but there's a time that the enemy will launch every attack that he has because you're a target and god has to arrange in a line and place and if he has such a great glorious track record back there isn't he the same god today your purpose is to reflect the light to this generation he said that if he brought us in this chaos that we're in now and prepared the good things of our life for us here how much more can we trust him to prepare the things that is to come see the eternal things it seems i say it's very strange listen he's telling us that god can if god can take care of the natural he can take care of the spiritual if god can prepare good things for us along the way in life he can prepare a good eternity for us if you believe that same man brother branham said in 1963 that hezekiah's sickness with boils was not by chance he said it happened for a reason in john 11 4 i don't have time to read it in john 11 4 jesus is talking he's just got the news that lazarus is sick and he is reacting to the news and he says this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of god lazarus sickness and his death was a part of god's plan hello hezekiah's boils was a part of god's plan in john 9 we read about a blind man and the folks are trying to decide whose sins it are who sins it word whose sins it was that caused him to be blind john 9 1-3 and jesus said neither hath this man's sin nor his parents but that the works of god should be made manifest in him it was a part of god's perfect plan that that man be blind because it was only by that that god could be glorified when he opened his eyes so the good the bad and the ugly in the message this day the scripture is fulfilled i won't read it it's paragraph 37 and 38 you can look at it later they could put it on the screen but if they do you might not listen to me brother branham is rehearsing what happened the day before he's talking about the mistake that was made he gets the new bible sister alfreda can tell you this very well because she was in you were in the service this lady right here for the put your hand up because there's some still don't know who you are sister elfrida was in the service brother branham's just been given a new bible he's going to john i think it was chapter 16 he was wanting to read from but he was reading out of john 17 because he said the india paper was so thin in that bible that the bottom of the page stuck together and he thought all along he's just reading away he thought he was reading the right place of scripture how many of you remember this you know the story at least and this priest rose up and began to calm brother branham maybe you'll flash that up i think i think you can show us i think i can read just what he said in paragraph 37 he said cause i think nothing happens by chance i was thinking about the comfort of this brother here coming telling me hold steady him being a priest oh steady maybe god is going to do something or something in that manner and i thought how could that be here's a mistake an embarrassing mistake have you ever been in an embarrassing situation brother braham's embarrassed he's standing before the full gospel businessmen in a great convention lots of things are happening this is a powerful few days of service some of the best and here he stands up his pages stick together he's trying to take a text he can't find the text he doesn't know what's happened and here's a priest that raises up on the front seat and steadies brother branham well maybe this has happened for a reason or something maybe god's going to show himself or show us something that prophet of god who had heard from god who had seen visions who was led by the spirit in that moment he wasn't even considering that he was considering how how how what a tether he got into reading the wrong and how will i correct oh what am i have you ever thought of that it took somebody on the outside to stand up and say now if you don't believe that that's how he took it look at the next next paragraph he said and then sitting there like a thunderbolt out of heaven it came to me the priests recognized that god was using this and that it was not a mistake i want you to hear me it was not a mistake it was not a victory for the devil the enemy had not won a goal god was doing something brother branham was unaware at that moment of what god was doing but when he sat down later and pondered it he said it hit me like a thunderbolt out of heaven he said and god took me to the scripture in luke where jesus is standing up in the synagogue and he's reading the prophecy of isaiah and the spirit of the lord fell on him he closed the book the bible said and he went to sit down and before he did he did something that was unimaginable he was not called up there to give commentary on the reading of the portion he was called to read it only and sit down this was the custom in the synagogue but after and listen listen notice that it was god who had jesus reading his own commission any other sabbath would have taken them to somewhere else in the prophecies but that day when jesus kept his custom that when he was in nazareth he attended the synagogue in nazareth he was there at the right day at the right time the scroll was unrolled to the right place he begins to read right where god wanted him to read and he was reading his own commission and when he closed the book the bible said which wasn't a book at all after all we know that a scroll just like the ones sitting up here he walks away and as he's walking away he says this day the scripture is fulfilled in your ears that's what god was saying in that happening that happened that day god has a message he has a word and there's a timing for that word come on now and so brother branham was then invited by democrat to stand the next night it was not his night to preach and he did not preach the message that we have this day the scripture is fulfilled is not a message it's only 20 something pages long it was it was it was the full gospel businessman giving brother branham an opportunity to explain that indeed the priest was right what looked like a mistake to brother branham what looked like a mistake to many others there was a priest there who caught it i wished you could hear what i'm saying oh he caught it and he said wait a minute don't trouble yourself calm yourself maybe it is and god is going to speak to us whoa and he did he wanted that valley he wanted that valley that arizona valley he wanted him to know that just like a prophet had raised up in the bible a prophet had been raised up among them and they ought to listen they ought to listen to what he was saying because the scripture was being fulfilled in their ears it's powerful so you may think that this is a mistake and that's been a mistake and that's been a mistake i want you to know these things that have happened along the way could absolutely be god bringing us somewhere taking us somewhere we may not see the message until we're sitting down one day with our mind on him and it hits us like a thunderbolt oh now that makes sense anybody with me let's see how personal i can get by with here's austin a young man not so young man but a young man not yet married been through a lot in his life failed a lot found a lot of grace found a lot of mercy don't you think he sits there wondering sometime when my time is coming don't you think that he hears these engagement announcements and don't you think that ever the thought ever crosses his mind when's my time coming he's not the only one he's just the one sitting right there in the front i want to say to him god doesn't make mistakes and he has not forgotten he has a plan for you you've not missed his plan you're waiting on his plan and you're as good as the best and better than the rest what billy andrews used to tell people because sometimes you get this idea i'm less than because you've got a past and billy andrews used to say i'll get her from there and quit feeling sorry for yourself your good is the best and better than the rest he said this message i'll tell you what he said he said this message didn't come for junk god sent this message for his elect his choice his bride the very fact you're hearing this message is proof of what you mean to god so he said you dismiss yourself and disqualify yourself but you're wrong to do that god has a plan steady yourself just hold on people cannot not people can misunderstand i know a young man that feels like he has a promise from god and he's waited and waited and waited and waited that promise hasn't been fulfilled he's been mocked and made fun of and ridiculed and cursed cursed out all because he was holding on to something he felt like god told him and as long as there was any possibility that it could be he wanted to hold on to that and i've never seen anybody i mean i'm being honest i've never seen anybody so privately attacked i've never seen such text messages and inboxes and instagram messages come to somebody who was just trying to hold on just trying to believe he believed that god spoke to him he's waiting on that word to come to pass he had a token of that he was holding on to that token i've never seen such a liking not too long ago a young man fell away from the lord and backslid and reached out and said he was going to come down here and whoop him and beat him and i don't know what all he was going to do and cussed and used the f words and all kind of supposed to be a young man raised in the message of truth and this young man just answered back i'm just trying look i'm not trying to cause you any trouble i'm just trying to hold on to what i feel like the lord has spoken to my heart come on folks what's wrong with people what you don't understand is god may be doing this there's others in this room waiting on a promise let's be careful not to be naysayers in one moment we gotta go he's here telling you the lord is here strange service strange atmosphere he's here all he has to do is step over to that one that's holding on to that promise it's like the angel of the lord passing through that neighborhood that night where them two women had a promise from god brother brahm had already pronounced them healed and there was no manifestation of that healing and one morning those two neighbors got their miracle at the very same time ran out into the road and was running to meet each other to tell each other what god had done and come to find out they both got their miracle at the same time brother branham was asked about that and he said well that was the angel of the lord walking through that neighborhood watching over the word of promise that old lying filthy devil the enemy of god the one who's painted a target on your back that wants to take you out and cause you to not believe that god's promises to you are true you ought to raise up today and tell him he's a liar you ought to raise up today and tell him you've listened to his lie long enough you're going to hold on to the promise of god god does not make mistakes you're not living your 2022 by luck or chance or happenstance you're living it by the divine program of the living god [Applause] every time i tell something personal we usually fall under some kind of attack spiritually so i pray that you will pray for my family and for their grace and their protection benjamin wanted to be married he felt like the lord had given him the girl that he was to marry he saw it way before the rest of his family saw it he begged me nearly a year ago but he was heading to texas is it all right if i should talk to her daddy and i said no it's not time it's just not time but daddy i yeah i know i know but it's just not time she didn't understand the delay we didn't know that until a few days ago she didn't understand the delay he didn't understand the delay here's how it came out we're sitting in our living room after they've after he has proposed and we've made a few plans and it's the day i think before she leaves and sitting there and even jenna spoke up and she said i didn't understand it i didn't understand it then but she said tonight i understand it she said i know that we have found the right time this is the right time benjamin said the same dad i didn't understand but now i know that we have found the right time does that mean anything does that mean anything no it means everything it doesn't mean anything it means everything to know that you're in the will of god is 50 of the battle to know that you're in the timing of god is the other 50 of the battle young people get it in their mind sometime and they'll say things like well what if jesus tarries them we don't ever get to have our let me tell you something that matters to you tonight but one breath of eternity what if we what if we wait so long we don't get to have babies before the lord comes are you really going to hold up the rapture for for labor pains you didn't come here for just the purpose of marrying and giving in marriage and having babies you are here to reflect the light you are here to manifest the word for your day and in order to do it you've got to find god's will you got to get in it you got to find god's timing you've got to get in it and if you don't understand it have a right spirit we never knew we never knew jenna was bothered by it i never really knew benjamin was bothered by it i'm used to him being bothered with me but they just kept it trust it in 2022 if jesus tarries it seems to be the right timing end of june seems to be the right timing and if it is there's not enough devils in hell that would be able to stop it and if it's not the right timing we trust a god who knows how to rise up and say thank you for your grace and protection over my family my times are in my hand i'm going to close but before i do i want to read something else from shalom 139 we have time see i did good i only come with eight pages today i got to all five of them five of the eight paragraph 141 i shared this with the church in japan and it blesses my blesser to know that foose was interpreting that day changing the pages are changing calendars doesn't change time a lot of people say well the old year's gone throw away the old december calendar now and put up the other one a new year that's that's what new year's means to them let's read on to me i want to see what's promised for the day hear me i want to know what the light of the hour is i want to know what word god's standing on for 2022 because that's what i want to get around that's what i want to rally around that's what i want to amen that's what i want to cooperate with brother branham said i want to know what the light of the hour is so i can know how to walk in it i want to know where i'm living what age i'm in how far up the road am i as paul said i could stand quoting again forgetting those things that are behind that are past now i press towards the mark the high calling to the complete identification when all time will fade out into eternity when jesus comes do as david did put your future young person old person in between person even if you're sitting here today and you think i've i've lived a whole lot more back there i've got a lot more days behind me than i do ahead of me even if you know that is probably your reality don't underestimate god's ability to move in your life in 2022. do as david did put your future into his hands don't look to anything else put david said here my time is in his hands you notice here in the psalms where we read it my time is in his hand he is my rock what is he he has revealed to me he is the revealed truth my time is in his hands amen oh my there you are my time belongs to him i am his i'm in his hand because he holds the time i don't know what the future holds but i know he holds the future so he who holds the future holds me so why should i think about setting forth this that the other for the new year you know statistics say that uh most new year's resolutions last on average of 20 hours that's not very long is it 20 hours one little precious girl she came to me this morning before service and she told me what her new year's resolution was but she didn't call it a new year's resolution she just reported it as a testimony and she said i'm not going to lie to my mom and daddy anymore i'm going to believe that that's more than just a resolution i'm going to believe that that is her faith declaration god will honor her to keep that but i'm looking down there and i'm thinking isn't that the most amazing thing to say i'm not going to lie to my mom and daddy anymore you don't think she knows she must know my time is in his hand knew that god whole the future david didn't know the future was but he knowed god had the future i don't know what the future is none of us do but we know he holds the future do you believe god holds your 2022 now i want you to listen very carefully and i i've said that probably a hundred times patience why did he have to go and say this some of you would have much preferred if i would have stopped to paragraph 145 but i put 146 in here just for you patience patience some of us get so some of us get in such a hurry i think a many a good man has done that you get in too much of a hurry you want to see you want to do it yourself and minister brethren you know from where i'm talking when i'm talking you that's listening to this tape i'm talking to you not only to the little congregation here but men around the world and this is not only to ministers but it works many men go out impatient but believing that the time is near you try to do something within yourself wait oh wait musicians are coming wait upon the lord it'd be better not to do it than to do it in the wrong timing yes you can destroy the brand of speaking to brother neville you get 99 right you get one wrong you can destroy lives you just get a little out of cycle get a lot a little out of season just get a little pulled or pressed or somebody pull on you i got to wear when i was traveling among the charismatic people some people would be bold enough to say do you have a word of prophecy for me i said i sure do acts 2 38 repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost sometime i just kept walking knowing that they were studying there was such a letdown because they wanted something that would build them up and tell them all the good things that are about to happen in their life i'm not even going to move into something like that when we don't get the abcs right we better come back and get the abc's right amen we better be sanctified by the washing of the water of the word and baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ filled with the holy ghost many men go out impatient but believing that the time is near you try to do something within yourself wait upon the lord patience is virtue if you can have patience it's virtue it's virtue they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength now they that try to get ahead of the lord they that try to tell the lord lord i know you want me to do this and glory to god i don't do that wait upon the lord the bible said they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength in 2022 you don't want to get ahead of god let me say it again in 2022 you don't want to get ahead of god in 2022 you don't want to get behind god in 2022 you want to walk with him come on now and in order to do that you must understand that this is not happening in your life by look or chance or happenstance god has a plan he has a program he has a symphony and you were part of that symphony in the message shalom in phoenix that was in sierra vista in the message shalom i'll do i'll skip 232 and i'll do 261. oh lord let me stay with him the word it should be the last quote you have there paragraph 261 would you just play something soft shalom uh sorry this is sierra vista i'm skipping the one in phoenix that's maybe what you're i'm so sorry are you finding it don't ever hold any of these little ladies or well it's all right if you hold nathan responsible but don't ever hold these young ladies responsible because to follow me as a a gift this is it oh lord let me stay with him the word and manifest his light through all of us as we set forth in this new year with the determination not knowing what this new year holds but we're holding to him the word that knows the whole symphony from the beginning to the end don't you like that you stand up there with your symbols ready you look down and you see the trumpets they're just all the time playing the violin all the time playing just play play play they just get all the spotlight you're standing up there with your triangle or your symbols and you're wondering when will it ever be my turn you're just about discouraged you're gonna quit the symphony they don't need me they don't never let me play there's no part for me in this and all of a sudden when you're just about ready to pack up your little triangle or your little symbols and and go home because you're not necessary the conductor of the symphony looks right at you and he reminds you it's your turn and you've been waiting that whole piece of music maybe you've been waiting the whole evening and now it's your turn you almost got cheated out of your moment because you were beginning to find that your little tone your little your little contribution you were beginning to think it wasn't important and now the finger the stick of the the baton of the of the conductor is pointed at you and you cannot miss the beat the one thing you don't want to do is play your little triangle out of rhythm or clash your symbols out of rhythm because then you've messed the whole symphony song the beautiful wonderful composition you messed it up because you got tired of waiting on his baton you sold yourself out as not having an important role and the baton is now in your direction and it is time for you to do what god called you to do and if you've only got one strike of a triangle or one clash of the of the symbols it ought to be you ought to give it everything you've got you better make sure that it's on rhythm you better make sure that it's in the right timing you better make sure if you're to strike more than once you do don't you dare be out of place and this is how brother branham is preaching in this message shalom and this is only the end here but he's talking about he knows the whole symphony he knows how to bring the instruments in and he knows how to push them out and bring in another section as the music rises and falls and each one has their part to play everybody can't play the tuba i'm so thankful everybody can't be the tuba player everybody can't be the woodwind you have to be your part you must play your role and you must be ready at any time for the baton of the conductor to come in your direction and give to the people what god has placed in your life stand with me would you what an unusual atmosphere hallelujah what is that what are you playing sing it oh i feel him i know i've wore some of you out but i feel the presence of the lord moving across this place [Music] you bring light to the darkness you give hope you restore every heart that is [Music] it's your breath in our lungs so we pour out our praise we pour out our praise into your bread yes so we pour [Music] out you give a life you are love you bring light to the darkness you give hope you've restored every heart that is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so we pour out our praise [Music] it's [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Applause] yes earth will shout your page our hearts will cry these bones will sink [Music] our hearts will cry [Music] just play i'm gonna take my liberty i have another story to tell two more [Music] billy tebow is how old are working at dale champs 21 years old working at dell champs in mobile and there is a romanian brother young brother there were two i think two members of the family worked there didn't they just one they were coming up here to visit i just shared this with our brother here because he knows the family very well [Music] they were coming to our services on sunday driving all the way from mobile and god was doing some amazing things and they were taking videotapes home and sharing it with loved ones and billy was searching for the lord he you know his testimony you've heard it regardless of the things that he's walked through in his life the fact that he's still standing today and sound is a testimony that it was god who found him and sustained him they take that tape and bring it and billy's hungry and talking they're talking to him about what god's done in our day and he takes that video and it gets in the hand of his mother he takes it to mississippi to his mother and she gets a hold of that tape and how many of you know her testimony i don't have to tell it those people had to come all the way from mobile to get here to get that tape to go to go all the way back and take it and one of them had to be working at dell champs and billy had to be working there at the right time and there had to be a conversation between them to make the atmosphere right enough that he would give him that that videotape [Music] one day i'm sitting in perry green's office and he says to me i really want you to meet eric erickson i said i don't know who that is he said oh that's the brother in iceland who owns a television station but he believes this message i said well i'd very much like to meet him years went by and years went by and years went by and i'm in israel now working for the lord and i'm speaking there for sister nancy and brother olaf comes to a service it must have been 2002 when i was there with my family yeah that's right we were there for four or five weeks and then come home for two weeks and went back and brother olaf comes to the service and after after it's over radwan has prepared a meal and we sit down and have a middle eastern meal together and this distinguished looking gentleman from iceland introduces himself and he said i was so touched by your message today and he said i i want my boss to meet you he said i work for eric erickson i said oh that name sounds from here he said yes he's he's iceland he said i i i thank you you and he had maybe believed some of the same things he said i'm going to have him to get in touch with you i would like for you to come to iceland all right months go by and months go by and months go by and one day at the church in columbus the phone rings and they say there's a brother eric erickson on the phone for you and i take the call and i do something very very strange i say hello he says brother steve shelley this is brother eric erickson and i said what took you so long he said sir excuse me i said i've been waiting on your call for years and it was an invitation to come to iceland and do you know why he was finally inviting me not just because he had met brother olaf had met me and went back and told him but hawk who had been serving sin had gotten a hold of god given his heart to the lord and he was filled with such expectation and he ran across the transvisions that god had given me in the 90s and he said i want we need to have this brother here and that opened the door of the invitation that brought me to iceland and it brought hawk here and i won't tell it every little detail because some funny little things come to my mind then but he put a redhead in the side of a redhead in my mind i'm trying to figure out how are we going to get these red heads together can i tell that good good just to know what you're gonna tell and i'm thinking how am i gonna get i gotta i wanna i want her to notice him and i want him to notice her at least see if it goes anywhere and marabeth was working for us she comes in with her laptop and she's going to show me something on the laptop or i'm going to look at something on the laptop and up pops a little picture here of my redheaded friend from iceland he was big i was being gracious it took up the screen and i realized i don't have anything to do in this god's already had heard notice him and him notice her and the next thing you know there's a wedding and three little redheads including the sweetest of them all sorry rebecca and and joseph este finally comes we could just absolutely go around this room you say yeah you're just you're just bragging on it listen let me tell you something not at all i'm telling you the benefit of being where god would have you to be at the right time at the right place not a head of god not behind god but willing to trust even though you ran away god brought you back you didn't miss your appointment it's not that i just want to pull in some negative i don't want nobody to think that any love story or anything that god is doing is always perfect and beautiful there's always bumps in the road there's always heartaches along the way there's always mistakes made but because he's a redeemer he just pulls everything together for yield to him i tell you somebody can have the 2022 you've been looking for if you put your trust in him oh my it's not just about marriage and babies i understand that completely but it's about being in god's order take us back to worship i'm not going to tell no more stories and all the earth will shout your praise our hearts will cry these bones will sing oh [Applause] great are you lord [Music] and all the earth will shout your praise our hearts will cry these bones they'll sing oh great [Music] our hearts will cry these

recognize that your life has not been just a a conglomeration of random happenings but that god has led you gently along when he couldn't be gentle he was at least gracious [Music] with one connection after another connection he has brought you this far and so there would be no reason for us to go back and expect a chance just happenstance would be what we would depend on in this coming year we are not standing here at the mercy of the world we are here in the hands of a merciful god you have every right to stand for your promise you have every right to contend for your promise you have every right to believe god for restoration and reconciliation you have every right to believe god to bring your backslid children to him to heal relationships to restore what has been stolen from your life you have every right to trust that god is able to recover all [Music] but it boils down to trust can you trust him can you really believe that all of your days and all of your times are held in his hand and if you can then your response to life is blessed be the name of the lord he gives and he takes [Music] but his name is worthy to be praised he is holy he is faithful he is true let's worship just a little bit more if you need to make a commitment to god do it now if you need to confess your trust to him do it now if you feel to come and worship with us you're welcome if not right where you are worship him commit your 2022 into his hands just know that he's got a plan and he's working it out for his glory by your sovereign will will you choose again today to cooperate with his program and his plan for your life god had a plan for saul and saul was just going to ride all over what god had for him he was going to miss it but god had a way of getting saul's attention struck him blind [Music] sent him to the gentiles in many places although peter was the apostle of the gentiles he used this righteous pharisee to bring us the greatest portion of the new testament god turned him around because he had a plan let's tell the lord right now we trust him i don't know who this young man is but some of you young brothers go and pray with him he has come to talk to the lord and we don't want to disturb him in that but we want to support him in that oh god may he surrender everything that he is may he hold nothing back may he recognize today like never before that

one as she makes her entrance into this world that there would be no unnecessary complication that you would divinely order who would be in that room who would be on call who would deliver who would insist that it would be just according to your plan and that the enemy would not be able to do one thing to adjust your perfect program for that moment in the name of jesus we bless this little one

[Music] that feels good hope it was good to see you come in smiling and worshiping the lord it's we're glad to see you be seated just a moment david how about you taking a microphone back for me would you would you get a microphone brother billy has an announcement to make this morning can't imagine what it would be it's his announcement might as well make it it was uh ironic that you had told that story because during the ironic is kind of close to chance and happenstance and look so could you choose another word but uh i was thinking when he was speaking i was looking back on my life and seeing that 21 year old well it was actually i was 19 when i went to dell champs and when i got there that first day i was supposed to meet my boss and i was told now he's your boss is darrell boulevard and he's in europe and he'll be back in two weeks and um i'm a mississippi boy thinking wow europe that's amazing but found out years later that he was actually in europe with my future wife and my future pastor's future wife that's right anyway during that two-week time i got transferred to a different shift so i didn't meet darrell till i was 21. and a lot of things happened and i was 21 years old and i was on the bourbon street new orleans and a street missionary was there and it set me on a journey to seek truth and uh darrell was instrumental in that with first tapes of brother brand and then tapes of brother shell and about a year later i find myself in the back of a church in edmonton sitting next to brother shelley and asking about some people but i noticed this girl on a piano and i was standing here during that before that we prayed for emily and rj and i was thinking well here i am in the back of a church looking at my wife playing 30 years later god's brought me through some pretty pretty hard times he has and i'm so thankful yes but during that when i first came to the lord in 20 when i was 21 i was thinking and the person he took me to is darrell and i'm like god that's two years i could have been serving you why didn't you let that happen then and that's when god let me know he spoke to my heart very gently and said because it you weren't ready it wasn't my time because i wasn't ready so since that time i do know god's got a perfect timing in everything yes he does so my announcement is about four years ago laurel was in canada and uh that's when zion met solomon and he's asked me for her hand i'm sure you told him no for a couple of times [Laughter] but i kept going back to there's a perfect time three times a charm well i woke up yesterday with a release from the lord and and i'm very happy to say i was able to give solomon my blessing to ask zion to marry him he didn't waste any time so yesterday afternoon he proposed and she accepted so i want to welcome him to the family sometime in the future so [Music] [Applause] well done brother let's stand you have an opportunity to congratulate them as they begin their life together we know that god indeed does have a plan it's very very difficult for this congregation to accept the fact that they will be making their life in canada it appears but we know that god sees all knows all understands all and he gets the last say i'm glad he does because i've spoke what i thought before and found out that he gets the last say he's always right so let's just love on them and let them know that we're happy that they are preparing to begin their life together i remember his dad before he was a married man and how many siblings you have two sibling solomon so now we see their family going on for god and his grandfather we've known for since night since the 90s 91 probably and he pastors a church in in edmonton it's a wonderful family and we're thankful that god has brought them together lord jesus we love you today above all things we thank you for what you've done for us how you brought us mighty long way they used to sing and we know you're going to take us the rest of the way what a joy to be gathered today like this what a wonderful privilege it is to be able to come together and lift up and exalt your mighty name i pray lord that each one of us will take a thought home with us from your word and if times get tough or things seem to be going amiss i pray that we everyone will remember that god has a plan you have a perfect plan and we want to be yielded and surrendered oh how you love us we recognize your love in the way you deal with us lord we just pray right now for every need in this room you're the healer you're the great physician you know how to heal you know how to go to the root of the problem and loose perfect healing in everybody lord we lift up those who are struggling to find their place in you and we pray that you will open up the way and that they will find as the prophet said today their full identification in you hallelujah we say lord as a body of believers and as individual believers we say we recognize today that our times are in your hand and there's no other place that we would rather them to be than in your hands lord go with us and keep us bring us back at the appointed hour ready to receive would you watch over those traveling we know joshua's coming home this week and brother and sister greeley will be traveling and nathan and shoshanna and maybe others we lift them up and thank you for the angels of the lord lining the highways those who may have a distance to drive today like our brother reed would you also give them great traveling mercy i pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen the church said amen you're dismissed to go in the name of the lord don't you love him how many of you love him and you're glad he loves you you're dismissed to go today hallelujah what can we just sing them out with thank you jesus hallelujah tuesday night i've learned to trust him [Music] precious jesus save your friend and i know know [Music] jesus jesus how i trust him how i approved
