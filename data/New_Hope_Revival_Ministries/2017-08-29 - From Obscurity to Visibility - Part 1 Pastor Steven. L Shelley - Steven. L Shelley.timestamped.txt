[0:03] assemble oh Jacob all of the I will
[0:07] surely gather the women of Israel I will
[0:10] put them together as the Sheep of bosra
[0:13] as a flock in the midst of their pasture
[0:16] they shall make great Noise by a reason
[0:19] of the multitude of
[0:28] men
[0:30] praise the Lord I'm Pastor Steph Shelly
[0:33] and you're watching the Eagles cry I
[0:36] want to welcome you to the broadcast
[0:38] today and I want to tell you that I'm
[0:40] excited about the day and the hour that
[0:42] we're living in this is truly an
[0:45] exciting hour to be alive why because
[0:49] Jesus is doing great and marvelous
[0:51] things through his people for his people
[0:54] in his people well we can almost say
[0:58] that Bible days are here again in
[1:00] because the reports of Miracles
[1:02] deliverances salvations even raising the
[1:05] dead these kind of Miracles are coming
[1:08] in from the nations of the world and
[1:10] although it's just in seed form now we
[1:13] believe that there's a great
[1:15] acceleration and a great multiplication
[1:18] that's about to take place we believe
[1:21] that truly the Lord Jesus Yeshua our
[1:24] Messiah is bringing his little bride his
[1:27] people from obscurity to visibility and
[1:31] that's what we're going to talk about on
[1:32] the broadcast today from obscurity to
[1:36] visibility that's the motion of the
[1:39] spirit it's like the blessing of
[1:41] elevation that we talked about in the
[1:44] life of Abraham where God is bringing us
[1:47] out um we're going to give you some
[1:49] scriptures some from the song of songs
[1:52] or as we know it in our King James
[1:55] version of the Bible the Song of Solomon
[1:57] we T we read where he talks talked about
[2:00] that beautiful bride leaning on her
[2:03] beloved coming up out of the Wilderness
[2:05] and anyway the next few broadcast we're
[2:08] going to share some exciting things with
[2:10] you so you be sure to stay tuned and
[2:13] let's see what the Lord has for us I
[2:15] want to just invite you quickly to go
[2:18] and visit our ministry website on the
[2:21] worldwide web at

[2:27] revival. G you'll find some some
[2:30] interesting information and resources
[2:32] available for you there there's
[2:34] preaching both audio uh perhaps some
[2:37] video and also in transcript form
[2:40] prophetic words and visions that the
[2:43] Lord has spoken to us in our local
[2:45] church and uh in different places where
[2:48] we have ministered around the world some
[2:50] pictures and so you might get to know my
[2:52] family and some of the Saints who are a
[2:54] part of this ministry here and uh also
[2:58] there is a place where where you can
[3:00] follow a link that will take you to
[3:03] iTunes to be able to download free on
[3:06] your computer the podcast we call it an
[3:10] Eagle Cast it's a uh uh it's in fact
[3:13] it's these broadcast that you're
[3:16] watching here on this network we're
[3:18] releasing them now right over the
[3:22] computer and so you can download them uh
[3:25] in video and audio right onto your
[3:28] computer and if you have one of these
[3:30] little fangled mp3 mp4 players then you
[3:34] can put it right down onto that download
[3:37] it right on to your little player and
[3:39] take it with you wherever you go we're
[3:41] excited we're just getting started in
[3:43] this part of the Outreach but we're very
[3:46] excited about it because we believe it's
[3:48] an unbelievable opportunity to take the
[3:51] gospel in a portable means you know
[3:54] there's a lot of people perhaps you even
[3:56] have friends and loved ones who are not
[3:58] able to see the Eagles cry on this great
[4:01] Network that you're watching right now
[4:04] but they have a computer and you'd like
[4:06] to share it with them in fact people are
[4:08] even downloading them burning them on to
[4:10] DVDs and passing them around and I give
[4:14] you permission to do that because we
[4:16] want to share some of the Insight that
[4:19] God is giving us in this day by the Holy
[4:22] Spirit we want to share it with all who
[4:25] have an ear to hear the more we get it
[4:28] around the better and so we're just
[4:31] excited there's lots of exciting things
[4:33] going on we also realize that this
[4:35] program is aired in many places of the
[4:38] world where people are are challenged in
[4:41] their finances where they are really
[4:44] needing more provision and a more of a
[4:47] release of finances in their lives and
[4:49] we're praying of course that God will
[4:51] help you to overcome uh that you will
[4:54] receive what you have need of both
[4:57] spiritually and of course in the natural
[4:59] but if you're watching this broadcast in
[5:01] a place and God speaks to your heart and
[5:04] you have the means that you could
[5:06] partner with us then we'd like to invite
[5:08] you to do that you just visit the
[5:10] partner button on our website or you can
[5:14] write us a little letter the address is
[5:16] given at the bottom of the screen or
[5:18] call us and let us know that you'd like
[5:20] to send a monthly amount uh of really
[5:23] any amount that you would like to sew
[5:25] into the Eagles cry broadcast we have
[5:29] just not ask for money we don't try to
[5:32] come up with little ways of getting your
[5:34] support but I think every now and then
[5:37] it doesn't uh misle the Lord or unleas
[5:41] the Lord not please the Lord if we would
[5:43] give you an opportunity if he so speaks
[5:45] to you to help us because we believe in
[5:48] expansion we believe that we're just
[5:50] scratching the surface right now of what
[5:53] God has for us and we want to be able to
[5:57] expand and to reach out and to see what
[6:00] God has you know this is a tremendous
[6:05] opportunity that God has given us one
[6:08] that we were not expecting one that we
[6:10] were not looking for but God opened the
[6:12] door for us to just share our heart um
[6:15] it's not glossy it's not glamorous uh
[6:18] you see that it's very simple just me in
[6:21] my chair but many times the anointing of
[6:25] the Lord will come and it will be so
[6:28] strong the presence of the Lord as we
[6:30] tape these broadcast and we get the
[6:33] comments we get the emails we get even a
[6:36] a a snail mail letter every now and
[6:39] again that says the anointing of God
[6:41] filled my home as you were sharing
[6:44] especially we've had tremendous response
[6:48] concerning the prophetic and some of the
[6:51] visions and the open portal and some of
[6:54] those wonderful things that we shared in
[6:56] previous broadcast and so also if if
[6:59] you're uh listening in a place where you
[7:02] have the means and you'd like to order a
[7:04] DVD of some of the broadcast you can go
[7:07] on the website or contact us and we
[7:10] would be happy to uh help get that in
[7:13] your hand maybe you'd want to share it
[7:15] we had people asking for the episode
[7:17] where we shared the portal picture the
[7:20] open Heaven picture and we'd be happy to
[7:23] get that to you we want to share it and
[7:25] get it out so enough of that let's get
[7:27] right into the word of God today let's
[7:29] see what the Lord would say let's
[7:31] prepare our hearts because we don't want
[7:33] to just be hearers of the word we want
[7:36] to be doers as well amen we want to walk
[7:38] it out we want to live it out we want to
[7:41] take it to the streets and I believe
[7:43] that's the thrust I believe that's the
[7:45] paradigm shift that's coming right now
[7:48] to the body of Christ that we're being
[7:51] empowered and filled up with the
[7:53] precious Holy Ghost and we're going to
[7:56] be launched from the church house right
[7:58] out into into the street into the
[8:00] marketplace into the community working
[8:03] the works of Jesus Christ and truly it's
[8:06] going to seem like the book of Acts all
[8:08] over again I believe that I believe
[8:10] there's great apostasy I believe there's
[8:12] been a great falling away from truth but
[8:15] I also believe that the Bride of Jesus
[8:18] Christ is receiving her wakeup call her
[8:21] marching orders amen and I believe that
[8:25] we're about to see some great things
[8:27] accomplished in a quick short word
[8:29] and then the Lord is going to keep his
[8:31] word and keep his promise and receive
[8:34] his people unto himself all right let's
[8:36] look to the word of God in the book of
[8:38] Isaiah Chapter 58 I want to read several
[8:42] verses uh to you or with you I should
[8:45] say in uh Chapter 58 beginning in verse
[8:49] 5 and I think we'll go down to uh verse
[8:53] 14 the last verse of Isaiah Chapter 58
[8:57] so beginning in verse 5
[8:59] is it such a fast that I have chosen you
[9:04] know that's not a very popular word
[9:05] anymore to fast to miss a meal for
[9:10] Spiritual reasons to set aside some time
[9:14] to seek the face of God to say I'm going
[9:17] to push my plate back and I'm going to
[9:20] sacrifice this time that I would
[9:22] normally be eating my lunch and I'm
[9:25] going to give this lunch hour if you
[9:27] work a job where you receive receive a
[9:29] portion of time allotted for a lunch
[9:31] hour I'm not going to eat my lunch today
[9:35] but I'm going to use this time to spend
[9:38] with the Lord and you know I believe if
[9:40] uh many of us would start adopting that
[9:43] practice into our lives on a weekly
[9:46] basis and we just did it maybe once a
[9:49] week just one lunch hour a week and we
[9:52] said Lord I'm going to give you that
[9:53] lunch hour I it it's kind of hard to
[9:56] imagine what kind of spirit spiritual
[9:59] results could take place if enough of us
[10:03] would Covenant and agree together to
[10:06] give God one hour of our work week for
[10:09] instance if you're a
[10:10] 40-hour uh worker and you and you have a
[10:14] one hour lunch out of your eight hour
[10:16] work day and you just said okay on
[10:19] Wednesday I'm going to give my lunch
[10:21] hour I'm going to read God's word I'm
[10:23] going to pray I'm going to go get quiet
[10:25] somewhere and and and just soak in the
[10:28] presence of the Lord and if enough of us
[10:31] did that and started receiving from his
[10:34] hand I believe that he would give us
[10:36] Revelation from his word and the
[10:38] blessing of his presence there's no
[10:40] telling what would happen so I think
[10:42] that we should remember that fasting is
[10:45] a part perhaps more than a lunch hour
[10:48] perhaps you'd say Lord I want to give
[10:49] you a 24-hour period that I'm going to
[10:52] just use as much of that time seeking
[10:56] you praying interceding believing
[10:59] turning my faith loose and perhaps God
[11:03] would even launch you into something
[11:04] longer but let's hear again what the
[11:07] prophet Isaiah is saying here is it such
[11:10] a fast that I have
[11:13] chosen a day for a man to afflict his
[11:17] soul is it to bow down his head as a
[11:20] bull rush and to spread sackcloth and
[11:23] Ashes under him wilt thou call this a
[11:27] fast and an acceptable day to the Lord
[11:31] listen at verse six is not this the fast
[11:35] that I have chosen a question to loose
[11:39] the bands of wickedness to undo the
[11:44] heavy burdens and to let the oppressed
[11:47] Go free and that ye break every yoke God
[11:52] said this is the fast that I have chosen
[11:55] this is the result that I'm looking for
[11:59] from your fasting and from your devotion
[12:01] we want to see Heavy burdens undone amen
[12:06] we want to see the oppressed the
[12:08] demonized the depressed the discouraged
[12:12] Go free and we want to see every yoke of
[12:16] bondage that the enemy has placed across
[12:19] your back to bind you to restrict you to
[12:23] keep you from fulfilling the purposes of
[12:25] God in your life we want to see those
[12:28] yolks broken and not only broken but
[12:32] destroyed the prophet Isaiah says in
[12:34] another place that because of the
[12:38] anointing the Manifest presence of the
[12:41] Living God the Yoke was destroyed so we
[12:46] want to see such complete and total
[12:49] Deliverance in the body of Christ
[12:52] whether it's alcohol or drugs or illicit
[12:54] sexuality or lust or or a gambling
[12:57] addiction or overe eating addiction or
[13:00] whatever the problem is I believe that
[13:03] God wants his people free he doesn't
[13:07] want us laboring under these oppressive
[13:11] uh yolks bondages habits things that we
[13:15] just can't get rid of so let this be the
[13:18] hour let this be the season where we as
[13:22] individuals just begin to focus on what
[13:25] it will take to see the oppression gone
[13:29] out of our lives and and when we begin
[13:32] to come up into that place of Liberty
[13:35] and Freedom the first thing you want to
[13:37] do when you get help the first thing you
[13:40] want to do when you get set free is to
[13:42] go help somebody else get free that's
[13:44] what's so wonderful about the loss of
[13:47] multiplication in the body of Christ
[13:49] when you get saved and your life is
[13:51] turned around upside down the things
[13:54] that youve once hated you now love and
[13:56] the things you once loved you now hate
[14:00] like the Apostle Paul said old things
[14:03] have passed away behold all things have
[14:05] become new I'm a new creature he said
[14:08] and when that happens in your life you
[14:11] you know I've heard people give
[14:13] testimony where they said uh the day
[14:16] after I got saved I woke up I went
[14:18] outside the grass was greener the trees
[14:21] were taller the flowers were more
[14:23] beautiful the birds sung more sweetly
[14:26] well I know exactly what that feels like
[14:28] that's the joy of the Lord uh it
[14:32] multiplies it it reverberates it
[14:35] ricochets back and forth in and out of
[14:38] our spirit man and we do really uh have
[14:42] that freedom to rejoice and so forth
[14:45] when we first come to the lord it's just
[14:47] like everything has changed and we don't
[14:49] want that to become common we don't want
[14:51] our relationship with him to become
[14:54] common we want to keep that freshness
[14:56] and that newness I heard a great uh
[14:59] teacher a great prophetic leader in the
[15:02] United States a fifth generation Pastor
[15:06] a father to many people spiritually
[15:08] across the world his name is Bill
[15:10] Johnson and I heard him say uh a very
[15:14] interesting thing his church is uh the
[15:17] it's uh bethl Church in Reading
[15:19] California and I heard him say an
[15:21] interesting thing on a CD of a
[15:23] conference where he was speaking
[15:25] recently that I don't think I'll ever
[15:27] forget he said I want to tell you how
[15:31] that you can stay encouraged be
[15:34] encouraged and stay encouraged every day
[15:38] of your life not getting discouraged but
[15:42] being encouraged every day of your life
[15:45] I'm telling you I reached over and
[15:47] turned up the volume because we all face
[15:51] discouragement we all face battles and
[15:54] when we're going through heavy trials
[15:56] and burdens well we get discouraged and
[15:59] we question and we wonder hey what's God
[16:01] up to and why is it taking him so long
[16:04] to get to my rescue and uh does he love
[16:07] me I mean you know according to our
[16:10] maturity in the spirit uh that's just
[16:12] how far the enemy can go with stirring
[16:15] up a spirit of question and doubt in our
[16:17] in our minds but for as many years as
[16:20] some of us have served the Lord we've
[16:21] been through the whole gamut we we have
[16:23] heard the the uh innuendos of of Satan
[16:27] and then we've also had him screaming in
[16:29] our face to cause us to doubt the
[16:32] promises of God and their effectiveness
[16:34] in our lives but there is a way he said
[16:37] Bill Johnson said there is a way that
[16:39] you can be encouraged every day of your
[16:43] life and here is what he said he said by
[16:48] remembering what God is doing right now
[16:53] and by remembering what God has done he
[16:58] said where where people get discouraged
[17:00] is when they Park their car now I want
[17:03] you to kind of see that it's an
[17:05] illustration and a good one we he said
[17:09] people have a tendency to park their car
[17:12] out there beside what God hasn't done
[17:17] yet the promises that are yet
[17:20] unfulfilled you know the Bible talks
[17:22] about Hope deferred and how it makes the
[17:25] heart sick and so if we park Our Lives
[17:30] you understand what I'm saying if we
[17:31] park our car if we drive our state down
[17:35] out there uh next to the things that God
[17:39] has not yet done and every day we Ponder
[17:44] see uh we meditate on what God hasn't
[17:48] done yet what he hasn't fulfilled yet in
[17:51] our life what we haven't seen him do yet
[17:55] that's where we uh entertain where we we
[17:58] invite and where we entertain a spirit
[18:02] of discouragement in other words you
[18:04] can't uh be discouraged unless you
[18:07] invite a spirit of discouragement into
[18:10] your life and and that Spirit of
[18:12] discouragement cannot stay unless you
[18:15] entertain it now now that's what I've
[18:17] added to this subject you know because
[18:19] I'm feeling inspired I'm feeling the
[18:22] spirit of the Lord on that and I think
[18:24] it's just feel like it's absolutely true
[18:26] in my own life and perhaps in your life
[18:29] if we start pondering on unfulfilled
[18:32] prophecies unfulfilled promises things
[18:35] that God hasn't done yet it's like
[18:37] inviting a spirit of discouragement and
[18:39] then as we continue to ponder and think
[18:42] and and meditate on those things
[18:45] forgetting forgetting what God has
[18:48] already done forgetting what God's doing
[18:51] right now oh come on missing the glory
[18:56] of what God is doing right right now
[18:59] because we're reaching and that's very
[19:02] good to reach it's very good to reach
[19:06] forth to reach out to lean into what God
[19:10] has promised that he's going to do and
[19:14] we believe it by faith and we stand on
[19:16] it by faith even when we don't see the
[19:19] Fulfillment or the reality I believe in
[19:21] all of that but I believe that we need
[19:24] to be more
[19:25] attached we need to be more an Ed to
[19:29] what God is doing in our life right now
[19:33] and what he has done somebody said well
[19:36] where do you get an idea like that I
[19:38] mean are you sure this will work well
[19:40] God must have thought it would work
[19:42] because how many times in the scripture
[19:46] in the Old Testament and also uh in the
[19:49] ministry of the Lord Jesus but
[19:51] especially in the Books of Moses the the
[19:54] Torah the first five books of the Bible
[19:57] how many times do we we hear God giving
[19:59] instruction through the prophets to
[20:02] remember remember remember remember
[20:06] remember build a memorial remember build
[20:09] an altar make a memorial remember
[20:13] remember
[20:14] remember teach these things to your
[20:18] children remember them and teach them to
[20:21] your children and your children's
[20:23] children cause them to remember the
[20:27] exploits of God the miracles of god the
[20:30] provision of God why do you think that
[20:32] was so important that God would would uh
[20:36] reiterate it over and over and over
[20:38] again I believe it's a key I believe
[20:40] it's a key I believe that it's hard to
[20:43] stay discouraged when you start thinking
[20:46] on the faithfulness oh
[20:50] Hallelujah when we start meditating on
[20:53] the faithfulness of God in the Years of
[20:58] our life and how he has never ever ever
[21:02] ever failed us he has always been there
[21:06] oh Hallelujah well I'm just getting
[21:09] excited because it's true in my own life
[21:13] he has always been there and I'm telling
[21:15] you you know uh I I used to preach a
[21:19] sermon that that uh said this was the
[21:23] title of the sermon God's
[21:25] delays are not God's
[21:28] denials there are times that the answer
[21:33] is delayed but it doesn't mean that the
[21:35] answer is no it doesn't mean that God
[21:38] has denied us it doesn't mean that God's
[21:40] not going to do it but there are reasons
[21:43] for delay uh for instance what about
[21:46] Lazarus when he died Jesus could have
[21:48] come immediately healed Lazarus of his
[21:51] infirmity and he would have never died
[21:54] but did God get more Glory I think he
[21:57] did I think God through Jesus received
[22:01] more Glory by Waiting by taring by
[22:05] delaying a and coming after Lazarus had
[22:09] already been dead three or four days
[22:11] because now he wasn't just healing
[22:13] Lazarus from his infirmity oh no he was
[22:17] all the body of Lazarus was dead and
[22:19] stinking and breeding worms Oh but the
[22:23] voice of the Resurrection was heard that
[22:26] day Lazarus come forth and
[22:31] Resurrection Life
[22:34] transforming
[22:36] metamorphosis life
[22:39] changing can you imagine it was like the
[22:41] Breath of God the ru of God was released
[22:47] and brought Lazarus right back to life
[22:50] restored him and he lived years after
[22:52] that we
[22:54] believe imagine what his testimony was
[22:56] so uh how was it was God more glorified
[23:00] in the fact that Jesus delayed he didn't
[23:02] come
[23:04] immediately uh but he waited and Lazarus
[23:07] finally died and then was raised from
[23:09] the dead or would it have been more
[23:11] glorifying to the Lord to just come and
[23:13] heal him as another sick man well it
[23:15] must have been the L the latter the
[23:17] former I I should say really I guess it
[23:20] it really would be that God received
[23:23] more Glory from the fact that he delayed
[23:26] or he wouldn't have done it
[23:28] you know what he's God and he doesn't
[23:30] make mistakes so this is how we learn we
[23:33] learn by observing how God has done it
[23:37] and so I feel really good about sharing
[23:40] this I feel really good of uh as though
[23:43] I'm speaking to somebody specifically I
[23:46] know I'm speaking to somebody that's why
[23:48] I'm sitting here but I feel as though
[23:51] I'm speaking to
[23:52] somebody uh specifically who has been so
[23:57] weit Ed down with discouragement the the
[24:02] spirit of discouragement has been so
[24:05] heavy on your life that you didn't feel
[24:07] like you could hardly breathe at times
[24:09] in fact I'm feeling a little bit like uh
[24:12] perhaps you have become so overwhelmed
[24:15] that you've been battling with anxiety
[24:18] and perhaps even some panic attack like
[24:21] symptoms and just uh couldn't get your
[24:23] head above water well I want to tell you
[24:26] something move your car you you've had
[24:29] your car parked next to things uh
[24:33] thoughts and promises and prophecies and
[24:36] and uh desires and Destiny words that
[24:39] have not yet come to pass and you you've
[24:42] lost your connection H you've lost your
[24:47] connection to the faithfulness of God in
[24:51] your past and in fact you're missing
[24:54] what God's doing for you right now
[24:57] you're missing it and so I believe that
[24:59] there's Deliverance for you and
[25:01] countless other people watching this
[25:03] program I I just feel like that we
[25:06] should take authority over the spirit of
[25:09] discouragement and
[25:11] despondency I know that circumstances
[25:14] may not be good uh situations may not be
[25:18] good right now in your life things may
[25:20] be going lousy but I know God and I know
[25:24] his faithfulness and I know how he loves
[25:27] his children
[25:28] and I know that with the help and by the
[25:31] grace of God you can get out of that
[25:35] place of discouragement and despondency
[25:37] we just speak to that spirit in the
[25:39] authority of Yeshua the Messiah and we
[25:42] tell it to go that's what Jesus did when
[25:45] he was dealing with these Spirits he
[25:46] just said go and because of the
[25:49] authority that he carried what they do
[25:52] they they they sat down and ate peanut
[25:54] butter sandwiches no they had to go and
[25:58] I believe that spirit that has you bound
[26:01] has to go oh Hallelujah I'm feeling good
[26:06] it has to go and I want to just
[26:09] encourage you quickly again um stay
[26:12] encouraged by staying connected to what
[26:16] God is doing right now and by staying
[26:19] connected to what God has done look

[26:24] were look where you've been brother
[26:27] sister
[26:28] look where you could have been think
[26:30] about it you know if you would have
[26:32] continued on the road that you were
[26:34] going down some of you would be dead
[26:37] some of you would have died tragic
[26:41] deaths uh totally undone and left a a a
[26:46] multitude of grieving people behind but
[26:50] God In His Infinite mercy and wisdom and
[26:53] love reached out to you pulled you up up
[26:57] out of the myy stuff that the the we
[27:02] used to say the myy clay the muck of sin
[27:06] and and redeemed you not just with some
[27:10] uh price some corruptible price but he
[27:14] redeemed you with an Incorruptible price
[27:18] his blood his blood was the token his
[27:22] blood was the price for your Redemption
