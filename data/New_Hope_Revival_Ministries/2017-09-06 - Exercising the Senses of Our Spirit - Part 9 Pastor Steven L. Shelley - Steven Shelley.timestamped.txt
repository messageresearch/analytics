[0:11] you
[0:16] you
[0:16] [Music]
[0:46] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen
[0:49] Shelley and you're watching the Eagles
[0:51] cry welcome to the program today we've
[0:54] been having a study for the past few
[0:57] weeks now on exercising the senses of
[1:01] our spirit we are spirit soul and body
[1:06] triune beings made in the image and in
[1:10] the likeness of God and we have been
[1:13] created to function with a dual
[1:16] functionality in other words we have
[1:19] been made to function in the earthly
[1:21] realm and also in the heavenly realm the
[1:25] spiritual realm and I'm anxious to
[1:27] continue this study today but before we
[1:29] do I want to let you know that we are
[1:33] thankful for your watching we're
[1:35] thankful that many of you have taken the
[1:37] time to share your prayer requests to
[1:40] let us know you're watching and what
[1:42] country you're watching in it's been an
[1:44] encouragement to us and I want to
[1:46] encourage you if you haven't done that
[1:48] as of yet to please take a moment of
[1:51] time to contact the ministry and let us
[1:54] know that you're watching and perhaps
[1:56] some of you would like to have the
[1:58] entire series on exercising the senses
[2:01] of our spirit in DVD we can make that
[2:05] available to you if you contact our
[2:07] ministry will let you know how you might
[2:09] be able to have that in your home
[2:11] because it's very difficult it with a
[2:14] subject this broad and important to get
[2:19] everything packed into one episode and
[2:23] so we're kind of trying to build there's
[2:25] a lot of repetition and so forth and I
[2:27] think it would be an interesting thing
[2:29] to be able to see it again and write the
[2:32] scriptures down and go back and study
[2:35] them for yourself because I believe
[2:37] there's a lot of truth that God wants to
[2:39] show us and this day about how we should
[2:42] be walking in the spirit and not after
[2:45] the flesh so let's get right into the
[2:47] study let's go right back into the
[2:49] scripture and see what
[2:50] we can find out from God's Word today
[2:53] okay let's do that let's read first in
[2:57] we were studying last time in first
[3:00] Corinthians we were talking about in
[3:02] chapter 15 verse 49 but I'd like to
[3:06] begin reading today in verse 45 of first
[3:11] Corinthians chapter 15 verse 45 and so
[3:14] it is written the first man Adam was
[3:18] made a living soul the last Adam now who
[3:23] was the last Adam Yeshua the Lord Jesus
[3:25] Christ was made a quickening spirit all
[3:30] right that's good that's important verse
[3:32] 46 howbeit that was not first which is
[3:36] spiritual but that which is natural and
[3:40] afterward that which is spiritual Adam
[3:44] was created first with a natural body
[3:46] then God breathed breath into him he
[3:50] became a living soul having then both
[3:53] soul life and spirit life then the Lord
[3:56] Jesus came and he came as a quickening
[4:00] spirit I like that very very much and
[4:02] the power of the Holy Spirit verse 47
[4:05] the first man is of the earth earthy the
[4:10] second man is the Lord from heaven he is
[4:15] of the heavenly realm as is the earthy
[4:19] such are they also that are earthy and
[4:22] as is the heavenly such are they also
[4:26] that are heavenly you see we've been
[4:30] invited to be partakers together of the
[4:34] divine nature the heavenly nature the
[4:39] nature of that which is spiritual the
[4:42] Lord Jesus Christ we not only are to
[4:45] function in the earthy or earthly realm
[4:49] but also walk in the spirit you know the
[4:53] Bible said if we walk in the spirit we
[4:56] will not fulfill the lusts of the flesh
[5:00] there's great benefit
[5:03] Stu walking in spirit life by living out
[5:09] of your spirit that has been rejuvenated
[5:15] resurrected by his spirit it's the Holy
[5:20] Spirit quickening and making alive that
[5:23] part of you your human spirit that has
[5:27] been dead dead and doled because of the
[5:31] fallen nature of man because of what
[5:34] took place with the fall with Adam and
[5:37] Eve in the Garden of Eden that spirit
[5:40] ability that ability to live in the
[5:43] spirit and to fully understand Adams
[5:47] dependency on his creator that was lost
[5:50] in the fall by the born-again experience
[5:53] that is renewed it is resurrected and
[5:56] we're learning to come to spiritual
[5:58] maturity to allow that spirit life to
[6:01] develop in us I like this verse let's
[6:05] look at it again 48 as is the earthy
[6:07] such are they also that are earthy and
[6:10] as is the heavenly such are they also
[6:13] that our Heavenly but we've been called
[6:15] to function in both realms and as we
[6:18] have borne the image of the earthy
[6:21] that's what this physical body is about
[6:23] we shall also bear the image of the
[6:27] heavenly this is not just talking about
[6:31] a resurrected body physically in the
[6:33] great resurrection it's talking about
[6:36] bearing the image in our spirit man of
[6:40] that which is spirit the very character
[6:43] and nature of the Lord Jesus Christ
[6:45] although it is in context it is also
[6:48] speaking to us of the changing of our
[6:51] mortal body putting on immortality
[6:54] corruption putting on in corruption
[6:57] absolutely but there's something about
[6:59] bearing the image the Express image of
[7:03] that which is life of that which is
[7:06] spiritual of that which is God and we're
[7:09] called to display the character of the
[7:14] Lord Jesus Christ but in our earthly
[7:16] carnal nature and in the realm of the
[7:18] soul we cannot accomplish that
[7:20] absolutely not it's only when we
[7:23] surrender our human spirit to the
[7:26] authority of the Holy Spirit and the
[7:29] Lord Jesus comes and sits on the throne
[7:31] of our spirit man and lives out of us oh
[7:34] this is his life living that's why some
[7:38] people fail so miserably at trying to
[7:41] live a Christian life keeping all the
[7:43] rules and Commandments and so forth it's
[7:45] because they try to do it in their souls
[7:47] power in the in the in the life that is
[7:50] only of the flasher of the soul but if
[7:54] we could truly surrender I mean all the
[7:58] way surrender so that the Holy Spirit
[8:01] lives out of us he lives out of our
[8:04] human spirit then we're really making
[8:07] progress and this is full adoption and
[8:09] this is the manifestation of the sons of
[8:12] God and this is the oneness and the
[8:14] union that we're talking about this is
[8:17] the intimacy this is really the intimacy
[8:20] message of how we are to become intimate
[8:24] intimately acquainted with the Lord
[8:28] Jesus Christ that's really what it is
[8:29] this is how intimacy develops in our
[8:32] life the enemy is very active to keep us
[8:35] earthbound he wants us living only out
[8:39] of our soul he only wants us living on
[8:42] this earthly plane this earthly
[8:45] dimension in the realm of a soul but
[8:48] we're coming as a as a body of believers
[8:51] who are being called by the Word of God
[8:54] and by the Holy Spirit in this hour
[8:55] we're coming into a place of true
[8:59] dependency I mean we're coming back to a
[9:01] place where Adam had a walk that Adam
[9:05] had in the beginning where he realized I
[9:07] am nothing without my Creator and you
[9:11] know we've done it all we've been there
[9:13] we've done that we've we've seen a lot
[9:15] as humans and it's Christians but after
[9:19] all has been said and
[9:21] done we are realizing that that we're
[9:25] just miserable we're just miserable
[9:27] without true dependency on him Jesus
[9:33] come and live in us through us Minister
[9:37] through us heal the sick through us save
[9:42] the loss through us deliver the captive
[9:46] through us you see it's like the prayer
[9:49] that jesus prayed and taught the
[9:52] disciples to pray I love the whole the
[9:55] whole of what we call the Lord's Prayer
[9:57] but there is a lot of it what all of it
[10:01] is of course relevant to where we are
[10:04] right now but there's something about
[10:06] this phrase that really speaks into this
[10:09] message thy kingdom come Thy will be
[10:13] done on earth as it is in heaven and you
[10:17] know really as believers we cannot truly
[10:21] sincerely pray that prayer your kingdom
[10:26] come your will be done until first we
[10:28] have sort of prayed a prayer that says
[10:31] my kingdom go my will go your kingdom
[10:35] come your will be done in other words
[10:38] there has to be a crucifixion of our own
[10:40] will and a full surrender to his will
[10:46] that we're coming into that place of
[10:48] intimacy with the Lord Jesus Christ so
[10:50] that he can teach us by his Spirit how
[10:54] to function in those heavenly realms in
[10:57] those spiritual realms because we want
[11:00] to hear that word behind us say this is
[11:03] the way waukee in it I think more than
[11:06] anything else I hear the cry of God's
[11:08] people for clarity they say we won't
[11:11] clear direction it's like the enemy is
[11:14] always coming to to confuse the the
[11:17] message that God's trying to give us it
[11:19] becomes cloudy our dreams are cloudy and
[11:23] vision is cloudy we see pictures it's
[11:25] like we're still in some way seeing
[11:27] through a glass darkly and we know that
[11:29] that's not the promise of where we ought
[11:31] to be in this hour and so we're trying
[11:33] to see what
[11:34] it is that God would have us to do so
[11:38] that we can break out of the rut and out
[11:40] of the routine of mundane Christian
[11:43] existence and step up into the life of
[11:46] the kingdom we're living in in the realm
[11:50] of the kingdom of God coming down on the
[11:53] earth a people functioning with the same
[11:58] authority that our Heavenly Father has
[12:01] this is the adoption this is what we've
[12:04] talked about many times walking and
[12:06] around the spirit Ephesians chapter 2
[12:09] verse 6 says and has raised us up
[12:12] together here we are we're being lifted
[12:14] up lift it up in the spirit and he has
[12:17] raised us up together and made us to sit
[12:20] together in heavenly places in Christ
[12:24] Jesus do you know one of the things that
[12:28] God is saying in this scripture through
[12:31] the Apostle to us is it is a change of
[12:36] perspective we need a change of
[12:38] perspective sometime we see things so
[12:42] much from that earthly plane that
[12:46] earthly dimension that earthly realm
[12:49] that we've been talking about we judge
[12:52] everything with that earthly judgment
[12:56] and discernment and I often pray when
[13:00] I'm praying I often say Lord from where
[13:02] you are you see things so much
[13:05] differently than I see them because I'm
[13:08] seeing them this way and God's looking
[13:10] down on them and we need to ask the Lord
[13:13] to help us to exercise to use the census
[13:20] of our spirit man so that we can begin
[13:24] to sit together in heavenly places with
[13:28] Messiah the Lord Jesus Christ and then
[13:31] look at our problems from Heaven's
[13:34] perspective looking down we're up in
[13:37] heavenly places spiritually sitting
[13:39] together with him and we're looking down
[13:41] at our problems and I promise you our
[13:44] problems will look a whole lot
[13:46] differently when
[13:47] see them from Heaven's point of view
[13:49] that's why i love the eagle I love the
[13:52] Eagle so much because he was chosen
[13:55] created by God to soar into the places
[13:59] of the heavenly to see things from above
[14:04] and not from this earthbound existence
[14:08] oh wow I just really sense the oil of
[14:12] the Holy Spirit speaking to somebody
[14:14] it's time for you to come up it's time
[14:17] for you to come up into heavens point of
[14:22] view we are raised up together
[14:25] hallelujah and made to sit together
[14:27] there is a higher order of life that is
[14:32] available to the spirit filled believer
[14:34] we're living so below our privilege
[14:38] we're living so below where God would
[14:42] want us to live and function the
[14:45] redeemed of the Lord are to be walking
[14:48] in newness of redeemed life Redemption
[14:52] life full of hope full of authority
[14:58] moving in the spirit hearing what the
[15:03] Spirit is saying to the church the Holy
[15:06] Spirit our human spirit has to be
[15:10] sanctified redeemed so that the Holy
[15:15] Spirit of course the Holy Spirit does
[15:17] that the Holy Spirit brings the
[15:19] regeneration and the resurrection to the
[15:22] human spirit and then we ask the Holy
[15:24] Spirit to come and live through our
[15:26] spirit to to rule our lives do you
[15:29] understand in this Redemption we're
[15:33] given spiritual senses senses of the
[15:38] Spirit these spiritual senses are are
[15:42] like a counterpart of our natural senses
[15:45] and they're just as real I want to tell
[15:48] you our spiritual senses are just as
[15:52] real as our natural or earthly senses of
[15:57] taste smell touch
[16:00] I hearing so far just as real as our
[16:07] five earthly senses and they're more
[16:10] help us to be connected to the earthly
[16:13] realm there are certain senses or
[16:18] sensitivities of the human spirit
[16:21] because of what the Holy Spirit is doing
[16:24] in us that are just as real and they
[16:27] help us to stay connected you know we
[16:32] need a big spiritual q-tip to clean out
[16:34] our spiritual ears so that we can be
[16:38] tuned in it's like a radio does anybody
[16:40] listen to the radio today they used to
[16:43] anyway and it's like these frequencies
[16:46] that bleed over you're trying to find
[16:49] tune your radio so that you can this is
[16:51] what God is saying I wanna people that
[16:54] are coming into a place of fine-tuning
[16:57] their ear so that we're not hearing
[17:01] through the flesh we're not hearing
[17:04] through our soul but we're hearing
[17:08] through our spirit that has been
[17:11] redeemed regenerated by the Holy Spirit
[17:16] it's a very very important place that
[17:20] God is calling us to walk now these
[17:24] spiritual senses only operate in those
[17:26] who are redeemed it takes the
[17:29] resurrection life of Jesus to give us
[17:33] back what was lost by Adam and Eve in
[17:36] the garden Ephesians 2 we just read
[17:40] Ephesians 26 but Ephesians 2 22 chapter
[17:44] 2 verse 22 said in whom you also are
[17:48] built together formed together for a
[17:53] habitation of God through the spirit not
[18:00] through the flesh not through the soul
[18:03] but through the spirit you're built
[18:05] together as a habitation you know we're
[18:09] not just looking for God to visit us
[18:12] we've had this at
[18:14] nation's historical revivals of
[18:18] visitation but we're in the end of days
[18:21] we're in that last cycle of God's
[18:25] redemptive plan and so another
[18:27] visitation is not enough thank God for
[18:30] visitations are you saying we don't need
[18:33] any no visit us now visit us now we need
[18:36] visitations we need revivals we need
[18:39] outpourings we need stirrings oh yes but
[18:44] we're contending for more than a
[18:46] visitation we're could listen I'm
[18:49] contending for every promise in God's
[18:51] Word that teaches me that God wants to
[18:54] do more than show up he wants to show up
[18:57] and stick around he wants to come and
[19:00] take up his abode he wants to tabernac
[19:04] on getting excited now he wants to
[19:07] Tabernacle in his body in his corporate
[19:11] body in his bride wow this is what God
[19:17] is after and so we say thank you for
[19:20] your visitation but Lord build us up
[19:23] till we come to a place where we are a
[19:26] habitation for the Most High God how
[19:29] will we get there through the Holy
[19:31] Spirit taking charge and Dominion and
[19:36] authority over our regenerated redeemed
[19:41] sanctified human spirit you follow me
[19:44] now here's another interesting verse
[19:47] first Corinthians chapter 12 verse 1
[19:49] speaks to us about the nine spiritual
[19:53] gifts now they're not just nine
[19:55] spiritual gifts there are many spiritual
[19:57] gifts there are many redemptive gifts
[19:59] but these are nine spiritual gifts that
[20:02] appear in first Corinthians chapter 12
[20:05] verse 1 now concerning spiritual gifts
[20:09] brethren I would not have you ignorant
[20:13] now when you're reading the King James
[20:16] version of the Bible and I assume it's
[20:18] also true in other versions of the Bible
[20:21] you will sometimes see words that are in
[20:25] italics do you know
[20:26] what that means a word that is
[20:29] italicized basically it's slanting the
[20:34] words a little bit to the side instead
[20:36] of having the letter straight up and
[20:38] down it slants them over to the side but
[20:41] it is something very interesting to
[20:43] notice in Bible translation because when
[20:47] you see a word that is in italics or as
[20:51] we say has been italicized you know that
[20:55] it is a word that has been added by the
[21:00] translators to clarify to make plainer
[21:04] the original text now that's I'm no
[21:08] problem with that sometimes it's an of
[21:10] or thee that has been added that
[21:14] basically does not change the text but
[21:19] amplifies or helps us to understand or
[21:22] causes the text to flow better but in
[21:25] this particular verse of scripture the
[21:28] word that is italicized as gifts which
[21:32] means then that the word gifts has been
[21:35] added by the translators so how should
[21:39] it read it would normally then read now
[21:42] concerning spiritual however that word
[21:46] spiritual is a plural so it really would
[21:50] read now concerning spirituals brethren
[21:55] I would not have you ignorant concerning
[22:00] spiritual senses spiritual gifts it's a
[22:06] Greek plural and it should read
[22:08] spirituals our spirit is recreated or
[22:13] resurrect it regenerated through the new
[22:17] birth by which our spiritual senses are
[22:21] somewhat restored but they must begin
[22:26] then to develop and mature that's part
[22:32] of what this verse of scripture saying I
[22:34] want you to understand spirituals
[22:38] spiritual
[22:40] and spiritual senses I wouldn't have you
[22:44] to be ignorant I want you to walk in
[22:46] full knowledge full revelation full
[22:49] understanding the apostle is saying how
[22:52] is that possible how is it possible for
[22:56] us to develop that part of us that is
[23:00] spirit life well we know how we develop
[23:03] that which is natural life the physical
[23:07] body we take care of it we nourish it we
[23:10] bathe it I mean come on we have to take
[23:13] a bath every now and then hopefully a
[23:15] shower maybe you only take one once a
[23:19] week or something that's your business
[23:21] it's not my business but on occasion you
[23:24] have to bathe your body with soap please
[23:28] and hot water you you scrub and you
[23:33] clean your body because in fact you know
[23:37] if you want to get very technical
[23:38] there's tremendous research by a doctor
[23:44] a Jewish believer a messianic believer
[23:47] one who believes in the Lord Jesus
[23:49] Christ who's written a tremendous book
[23:51] and study called the makers diet and I'm
[23:54] not here to promote that but it's a very
[23:58] interesting study and it is one that has
[24:02] come out of his own personal experience
[24:04] where he almost died dr. Reuben Jordan
[24:08] Reuben he almost died and began his
[24:12] father was a naturalist and and they
[24:15] studied and they they found out so many
[24:17] interesting things and one of the things
[24:19] that he teaches so much is is
[24:21] cleanliness and he even encourages
[24:25] people to scrub under their fingernails
[24:30] because we carry bacteria under our
[24:33] fingernails and he even encourages
[24:35] people to wash out their eyes with a
[24:38] cleansing solution to wash out their
[24:40] nose with a very natural to to take up
[24:44] some of this water the cleansing water
[24:47] up into your nose and and so forth
[24:52] because
[24:53] of the bacteria that we take in and
[24:57] research says that a lot of sickness is
[25:00] transmitted that way the skin is a big
[25:03] organ you know it is an organ of the
[25:06] human body and and it is sensitive to
[25:10] absorbing things and so forth so it's
[25:12] important to be clean I didn't know it's
[25:14] going to give you a lesson on hygiene
[25:16] but this is how we take care of the
[25:18] human body and this is also how we need
[25:21] to work on our soul our soul needs to be
[25:24] sanctified we need to sanctify our
[25:27] memories our imagination our conscience
[25:30] our affections and our reasonings they
[25:33] need to be cleansed and so does the
[25:36] human spirit now how if the if the
[25:39] physical body is cleansed by water and
[25:43] washing and the soul is cleansed by
[25:46] sanctification by the washing of the
[25:49] water of the word how is the spirit
[25:51] cleansed in the same way in the same
[25:55] spiritual way waiting in the presence of
[25:58] the Lord did you know that worship is
[26:01] not about you it's about God but you
[26:04] receive the biggest benefit you receive
[26:07] the biggest benefit did you know that
[26:09] worship is cleansing to empty yourself
[26:12] out that's what worship is it's an
[26:14] outflow of what is on the inside it's an
[26:19] emptying of all that you are pouring
[26:23] yourself out like water like oil on the
[26:27] feet of Jesus Christ when we do that
[26:31] it's it's a cleansing that takes place
[26:33] in our spirit man in our soulish life Oh
[26:38] father help us to spend more time in
[26:42] quiet intimacy quiet worship quiet
[26:46] reflection meditating on the Word of God
[26:50] letting your spirit absorb the word how
[26:55] do you do that well you do that by not
[26:57] trying to interpret it at face value the
[27:00] soul likes to grab it and take it at you
[27:03] read it oh I know what that means but
[27:06] you know sometimes
[27:07] we don't read it and know what it means
[27:09] sometimes we have to ponder it I have to
[27:13] take verses of Scripture back to God
[27:15] he's the author I have to take them back
[27:17] to him sometime and say Lord I'm getting
[27:20] it but i'm only getting it on the
[27:22] surface I want to understand the deeper
[27:26] levels of your word I believe that
[27:30] revelation comes in layers and I don't
[27:33] want just the surface layer are the soul
[27:37] that which the soul grabs ahold of first
[27:40] I want every word of God to nourish also
[27:43] cleanse also sanctify also my spirit
[27:47] another way that we take care of the
[27:49] earthly body is by feeding it we eat
[27:52] good food help the living food food that
[27:58] is alive did you know that's part of
[28:01] what's wrong with us in America
[28:03] especially and around the world it's
[28:05] what we eat we need to be more careful
[28:09] about what we eat in the natural and in
[28:13] the spiritual so father help us Lord I
[28:16] just ask that you would help us to learn
[28:21] how to take care of our spirit man to
[28:26] cleanse him and to nourish our spirit
[28:32] man father help us to enter into those
[28:35] places of worship in you where we just
[28:38] pour ourselves out empty ourselves out
[28:40] and then we say Lord fill me up with you
[28:43] I want to get all of me poured out so
[28:45] that I can be filled with you Father I
[28:49] ask you to make this word alive in the
[28:52] hearts of every listener in the
