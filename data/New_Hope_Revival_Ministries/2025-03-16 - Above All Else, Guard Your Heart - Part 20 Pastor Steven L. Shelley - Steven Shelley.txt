Title:    Above All Else, Guard Your Heart — Part 20 | Pastor Steven L. Shelley
Speaker:  Steven Shelley
Church:   New Hope Revival Ministries
Type:     Full Sermon
Duration: 3h 29m
Language: English
URL:      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z1z8s3-2M0
========================================

Description:
This message explores the tension between worldly standards of beauty and godly character through two biblical narratives: the proud daughters of Zion in Isaiah 3 and the humble Esther before King Ahasuerus. Pastor Shelley warns against the gradual compromise of biblical standards while emphasizing that true holiness flows from the heart. The sermon presents Esther as a type of the Bride of Christ who discovers what pleases the King rather than adorning herself according to worldly standards, ultimately finding favor through her meek and humble spirit.

name wonderful Jesus wonderful savior we give you glory we give you honor we give you praise isn't the Lord wonderful I don't know what's wrong with some of you the Lord is wonderful and he's worthy to be praised you may be seated I want you to get as worked up for him as you did about a storm I want to see you posting all day long today that he is on the throne amen and if you didn't get a chance to see brother that little clip of the of the uh movement on radar that brother Dan Daniel posted today take a look at it it'll show you what God was doing he had his hand on this area and the storm just moved North you watch every bit of it come from way south of here and just move just like that while we're just held here and the the image of it is really uh noticeable it's very noticeable there was nothing moving in that area and and those storms were just God is so good it hat build at our house for about somewhere between 3 to 5 seconds and some of the hailstones were the biggest I've seen in a long long time but they weren't all that big that's what I noticed there were many many small ones and a few larger ones in the in the bunch and I saw them laying that the wind was blowing them and they were laying on the window seal and uh lot of lightning and thunder and you heard you saw the wind all day yesterday and and and it picked up but and and many in other places certainly lost they lost lives they lost possessions and I don't want you to think that we think that we're any more loved or any more favored than any of those people but God is good and he promised he promised he promised that he would watch over us and the reality is just simply this if you are ready to meet the Lord and you know you're ready then it doesn't matter whether you hide under the bed or get in the closet or or uh I mean I was a little surprised that they were instructing and encouraging people to put on football helmets this I've never I've never really heard this before and I knew that if I was going to have my family in Israel during inata and we weren't going to wear gas masks as they asked us to do I knew we weren't going to go looking for football helmets because God is a great big God now that doesn't mean that we shouldn't use wisdom you know here's our wisdom we get a candle out and put it on the table in case we need it and I charge my flashl that's wisdom amen and uh we ask the kids if they want to come down and stay with us because they're in the mobile home that's right up on top of the hill it's in a high place and they weren't sure if they would but they ended up doing that and the other wisdom is we pushed the air mattress far away from the window as we could get it went to bed and slept until I had to go to the bathroom and that's when I realized it was storming the storm didn't wake me up I realized when I woke up and uh looked out and saw all that and went back and I started humming to myself the the the old uh Betty Jean Robinson song I can sleep like a baby I've got peace in my soul because God has got everything under control amen now I know some people don't believe that but he does and I want you to know that if that storm was meant for you to take your life if if you have come to the end of your days it would find you it would find you I'm not trying to be crazy I'm trying to say we believe a certain truth that's called sovereignty and that means that God is Sovereign and if in his predetermined plan he thought well I want her home and I'm going to just use the the storm is a br I'll just use that to bring her home he would find you in the basement in the closet uh with your helmet on my mama used to get under the couch and turn the couch over on top of her well first of all I'm too a little bit claustrophobic I couldn't live I couldn't live under to the couch she turned the couch over on top of her and got down under it and put mattresses in the tub when I was little sat us sat me in the tub with mattresses all around I learned the the drills in school how many of you remember the uh tornado drills in school what did they have you to do we'd go out into the hallway we'd sit with our backs up against the all the glass all the glass above the doors but we were just right there we all sat along the way bent our heads over and used our bare hands to protect us and we sat there like that does anybody think that was much protection I don't think it was but that was all we knew to do that's what they told us to do this what we did and they made us practice it in sunny weather so we could get it right I realize then even as a child I realized something's a little bit wrong somebody's trying to cover themselves somebody's trying to keep from being sued because this is not much protection brother those angels that were called in on our behalf last night if you could have seen them you would have known there was nothing to be worried about wisdom whatever you see is wisdom do it but there was no reason to be worried we trust in him 100% And I I don't know how many I had to answer from all over this country texting inboxing are you all okay at least 24 hours before we had even seen a raindrop come on worried and concerned about us that makes me feel very good that people care but I want you to know the Lord was with us we're all here today uh praising him and some of us maybe you're maybe you were up all night talking and partying and having a storm party at somebody else's house and you're sleepy this morning you should have gone to sleep you should have slept my grandfather used to wake my my big mama up he'd wake her up middle of the night banging on the door mild get up get up get up get up get up get up what is it honey there's a tornado passing down Neil drive that was the road that went out in front of her she said as long as it stays out in the road I'll be all right she said I'm going right back to sleep honey he said well would you at least put your purse by the door in case we oh yeah he said you can put here's my you go put it by the door in case we need it uh but that was really her her thought if it's my time to go it doesn't matter uh what kind of storm shelter I dig in they're selling them you know you can buy them now we didn't used to have them that used to be for cansas and other places where you can catch a cyclone to another world you know and they used to have have but we never had storm shelters here until the tornado that took so many lives in borgard I have one his feathers covered me his feathers were covering you

there's a lot of things that take place and have been celebrated that shouldn't be celebrated Jesus is the one worthy to lift up amen and I'm not wearing green for St Patrick's Day and I'm not getting into all that kind of stuff and Saints aren't always Saints I I'm going to read you a quote this I mean I believe he was certainly a godly man but I'm going to read you a quote this morning where

nice [Applause] today amen we ought to do good on Sunday we can look nice on Sunday can't we we should we're coming to the Lord's House amen we're a little more casual on Tuesday night because people are coming from work including me I I just sometime get home in time to grab something and get back and there no harm in that I know some of you think that we should wear three pece suits on Tuesday but I don't see you doing it but I like to be a little more relaxed on Tuesday night but on Sunday we ought to do a little better because we're coming here to honor the King of Kings and the Lord of lords you know somebody said to me well they said you know I I just have to let my children run around a little bit because we we let them run around at home and we we can't confuse them by telling them they can't run around at church you know I don't I don't buy into that philosophy at all you you better teach them that there's a place to run and play and have fun and a place that's sacred if you don't teach them when they're little if you don't teach them that when they're little they will never get that when they're older it's all right it's all right in their little lives for them to have places where they know they're safe and they can just enjoy theirself but when they come to God's house it's all right to start working with them and teaching them that this is a place where the only running around we do is when we're praising him amen you can be loud at home and just have your fun at Nanas and paps and uh grandies and whatever pops and I don't know what all you all use but you can but when you come to God's house you got to learn a little bit and it's not easy it's a process to teach them isn't it but you'll be blessed if you do it you'll be blessed if you hear what brother gy said today and teach them that that the tithe do do belong to them when they're little like that and they bring their little quarter up here and put it in envelope and they want credit for it there's nothing wrong with that it teaches them that there's a portion of the blessing of God that he gives to them that belongs to him and if you'll be faithful to do that through your life you will enjoy a blessing that's promised to those who are faithful in those areas let's turn to Isaiah chapter 3 this morning and um we will uh I was going to try to read another scripture to try to bridge the way into this one but um I just didn't do it so we'll just how many of you think we ought to just hit it hot and heavy from the start Isaiah chapter 3 beginning in verse 16 remember this is a prophecy from the from the prophet Isaiah and he is prophesying to the to the house of Israel to the children of the Lord and he said moreover the Lord saith because the daughters of Zion are hauy we've been working on offense and we have been working on how Pride partners with offense and pride can manifest itself as haughtiness and as arrogance it can manifest itself as someone who thinks that they are uh Superior in some way to others morally Superior or they have a better education or they or they come from a from a uh you know a higher place in society and uh you know that's nothing that that that's just fodder it means nothing whatsoever your pedigrees and your categories and your cast system it means nothing to the Lord he the ground is level at the foot of the cross but when God God's people get arrogant when God's people uh lean on pride pride partners with offense and offense leads to deception and so there's something that we've got to watch in our lives those Spirits when they start coming together to strengthen one another and the prophet Isaiah said you know the the people of Israel the children of Israel were dead desert dwellers a and they were plain people and although they brought some SP oil out of Egypt they were they were plain living people and when they when they lived plain when they lived simple before the Lord they enjoyed the benefits of the favor of the Lord but then they started getting proud and long about that middle part of the Old Testament when the prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah Ezekiel and others began to cry out warning the people of Israel they begin to get a little proud they begin to get a little huy and particularly in this portion of scripture the women are the ones who are getting a little a little little high and lifted up and he said because the daughters of Zion are hoty and they walk with stretched forth necks you know In some cultures it's important to have a stretched neck in certain African cultures they put gold bands around their neck and they keep adding to them and adding to them lit Al physically stretching their neck so they begin to look like giraffes instead of people you know that don't you because in their culture the the longer your neck the the the you know more Prestige you have and this must have been already kind of going on the thought of of this stretching of the neck was already going on in the days of Isaiah's prophecy because they're walking around with their head in the air and want and eyes now if you don't know what want and eyes are let's call them bedroom eyes and those bedroom eyes are eyes that you have for your husband you don't have a husband then you don't need Bedroom Eyes uh don't look at me with them I'll tell you that right now and don't look at anybody else except the man you love with those eyes because uh uh women have learned through throughout the time that those little eyes can say so much if you know what I mean this is God's people and they're walking around with stretched necks and bedroom eyes and and they're walking and mincing as they go now when we think of mincing we think of chopping we're we're going to have some minced meat we're going to have some chopped something chopped sooi things cut up in little pieces well in order to do that there has to be some some agitation you understand to make things minced so these women are sort of using their body twisting as they go do you know what I mean this was God's people stretch necks bedroom eyes and now they're throwing their hips back and forth and you don't have to have on high heel shoes which are not godly but you don't have to have those on to have a little hip action and don't ever tell me that that a woman doesn't know when she's swaying like that because she certainly does know it and there's no reason to do it and if you see a man doing it you better really pray for him are you still here yes and they're making a tinkling with their feet now I don't know but my feet don't make a tinkling sound when I walk I don't have anklets on and I don't have toes tow rings on and I don't have things hanging on my ankles like the world wants and here was God's people picking up some of this uh uh Pride red toenails you know and uh tow rings and anklets and all this kind of stuff and they were so uh done up that when they walk they begin to make a sound you knew at least you knew they were coming right he's prophesying he's not criticizing he's prophesying therefore the Lord will Smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion and the Lord will discover their secret Parts it means the Lord will lay them be the Lord will expose their nakedness now he's not just particularly speaking about the anatomy he's speaking about the secret desires of their heart to be like the women of the world their motive is going to be exposed and there's going to be nothing hidden from the lord they're going to be bare before the Lord he said in that day the Lord will take away The Bravery of their tinkling arm ornaments about their feet and their calls and their round tires like the moon uh all of these round things you just just follow it I'm not breaking down every word I will do that for you at some point because we haven't done it in a long time but you're just thinking of round things all of these things hanging on women uh round tires like the moon their calls the chains and the bracelets it's mentioned right in the word it's right there in the scripture I don't believe the Lord is talking about your rubber band your rubber uh memory bracelet or whatever they call I don't think the Lord is particularly talking about your thread or your crochet but I think if we start leaning toward the gold and the silver we're getting more and more just like the world around us and the reality is it doesn't make you more beautiful your beauty is not in how much you tinkle when you walk this is going to be a little hard for my children because of the way I use the word tinkle but I'm not using this for the bathroom I'm using this for the s that people make sometime when they move around are you following me somebody said oh oh this is really going to be a sermon chains and bracelets and mufflers and and bonnets and ornaments of the legs and headbands this is jewels and the tablets and the earrings you know they're stirrups for the devil rings and nose Jewels now these things are specifically mentioned but now he gets a little more General and he says the changeable suits of apparel and The Mantel and the wimples and the crisping pins that's curlers and irons and all of these things that people get so carried away permanent chemicals to permanently twist up their hair and make them look like poodles and instead of Believers anybody with me now glasses and remember that this there there were no prescription glasses this is talking about ornamental this is talking about decorative this is talking about uh Fine Things fine linen hoods and the veils and it shall come to pass ver uh did I miss something here no verse 24 it shall come to pass that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink and instead of spanks uh excuse me instead of a girdle a rent and instead of well set hair baldness and instead of a stomacher a giring of sackcloth so no one is going to be cinching them in that's what it's talking about and burning instead of beauty thy men shall fall by the sword now the men are losing out they're losing out because they're following their eyes can't stay off of these Daughters of Zion and it's not just eyes their heart is following lust is coming in and they're going to fall By The Sword and thy Mighty in the war and her gate shall lament and mourn and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground now that's pretty serious words God help us today as we approach your word we we ask for your anointing to help deliver and to help receive that which you would say to us we're not here to end somebody's life we're not here to uh condemn anybody we're just here to say that there is a progression and and we better find our place to stop we better not keep following the trend else we wind up in the condition that the daughters of Zion ended in where there is no stop and where they began to look like the Gypsies and the nomads of of the of the land those who who traveled around with all of their jewels on at one time and all of their layers of clothing at one time to present themselves uh as having Prestige may we understand that the beauty of a Believer is from the inside it's not in fanciness it's in humility that you're going to bless us in this hour I'm going to need your help Lord because some will sit down on me and I'm going to need your help I'm depending on you now in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the Saints said amen amen you may be seated now we know that God is not specifically in this Prophecy from Isaiah condemning any of these particular things we're we're not seeing anything in there that says that these particular things individually pose a problem but what we hear the prophet saying is these are things that the women of Zion are picking up from the Heathen they're picking them up from Godless societies and Godless tribes and those who don't know Jehovah the God of Israel and there seems to be a an increasing desire among them to make more beautiful the outside while the inside is plotting and planning against the men come on now I want you to hear what I just said so if any of these things have been your habit I don't want you to look at that as though that any of these things individually have been identif ified as something that we should not participate in but yet there are many things there that we understand by the word of the Lord that Believers should not be involved in but Isaiah is specifically saying it's it's so much that there's no stopping place it it just goes on and on and on brother brandham knew this was going to be a problem because he contrasted the difference he said you know if a if a husband wants to give his wife a little chain or something and she wants to wear that in respect for husband he said well that'd be all right and but then he talks about women Pentecostal women looking like they have gone through the dime store magnetized because they're just taking everything all kinds of bedazzles and shiny shiny shinies hello and and putting them on to hide who they really are we we hide behind things some people hide behind instruments in church some people hide behind their babies some people hide behind their husbands a and and sometimes women according to Isaiah will put things on and then kind of hide behind it because there's something lacking and something missing on the inside brother brandom tells us that a woman is born with a desire and then a desire to to be beautiful and and if you're against that you're just ugly I for one am not against my wife being beautiful I'm for that that's not the reason I chose her but it certainly took my breath away do you understand it's not wrong that a woman wants to match if brother Brandon wanted to wear sear sucker with something that didn't match and plaid and what whatever he wanted to do that was all right for him to do it but I want you to know Sister ma didn't look like that she tried to match and her purse matched her shoes and she tried to to to be beautiful because she was representing him you see the daughters of Zion forgot who they were representing they weren't just representing their Soldier husbands but they were representing the god of Israel The God Who dwelt in Zion anybody with me and so they were not just reflecting on their families or their parents or where they came from but they were actually reflecting on the god of History the god of Israel the God who brought his children out of Egypt The God Who fed him with Mana who fed him with Quail The God Who allowed water to come out of a rock when they were thirsty and when the water was bitter he made a way for the water to be sweet and when the ocean kept them back he opened up the sea and made a way for them to pass through how many of you are with me that's a God who loved his people yes a God who was faithful to them and a God who wanted a people who would walk before him in humility in meekness in humbleness of heart both genders men who would not be so proud of their military might that they didn't give God credit for his strength and courage women who wouldn't be so proud of their beauty that they would pick up the ways of Egypt and the ways of the amalekites and the ways of the Canaanites because he wanted a separated people if God said I don't want your peas and your corn to grow in the same row he wanted even their Farm to be identified as belonging to a child of the king of kings Jehovah God are you with me and so if he cared about that so much that he even told them under that ceremonial law that your clothes could not be made of mixed fiber and there were all kinds of added Securities placed on how they would dress and how they would live how they would worship how they would bring offerings unto the Lord it was a very organized and a very meticulous plan that God had created for his people how it must have grieved his heart when he saw saw them beginning to put on the bracelets and put on the anklets and put on the all of the different things the twistings of the hair and and the ways that they would try to make them it's not that God wanted his women to be ugly it's not that God cared if the Israelite women uh were beautiful he he made them beautiful he just didn't want them taking on the appearance of the women of of heathenism the women of paganism the way the women of false religion he said they can be beautiful but they don't have to put on and Trust in changing of garments and and all of these mirrors and all the time do you know that even in Victorian days women use mirrors as part of their outfit and they used fans as part of of their outfit and they would walk walk around looking at themselves this is a spirit of Pride and God said I'm going to have a people and they're not going to be necessarily homely they're going to be a beautiful people I'm going to beautify them with salvation they're going to walk differently they're going to talk differently they're going to dress differently they're going to definitely differentiate between the genders but I don't want them picking up too many of the habits of the other nations because if they do there's no stopping place are you with me all we have to do folks is I'm not going to be on this the whole time you can relax all we have to do is look at Pentecost there's even memes on social media that compares the dedication of a woman a Christian Pentecostal woman that compares her dedication to the Lord to the length of her skirt have any of you seen it and it even makes this statement that the one who wears the longer skirt is going to be the Wednesday night Christian I'm not saying I espouse that Doctrine but I'm just saying here is a this is their opinion this is the way they put it together they're saying here is a woman who's going to be faithful and here is a woman that's not going to take chances and here's a woman that's not going to live on the edges here's a woman that's going to go all the way I'm not espousing or saying that a woman has to cover her ankles I'm not saying that her dress has to drag the ground I'm not saying anything like that but I'm saying that even the the United Pentecostal Church out there they they even understand how that standards have changed Through The Years skirts shorter and heels higher and necklines lower and what we're doing and what we're seeing and the trend that we're seeing in in in in the 50s and 60s they preached against the split in the skirt and they were only about an inch or two inches in that time and now you'll see uh UPC and Pentecostal women sometime with a split that goes all the way up to their hip and when they walk the one goes one way and one goes the other and you see they're underneath garments I remember it's it didn't matter to me if it's quiet it doesn't uh I remember when they started cutting their bangs hair way down in the back but they started cutting their bangs I remember the trend of the Jackson nightes around this message who began to say you can cut your hair an inch at a time and now if you saw some of those women it's way up to here died blue old women because there's no such thing as an inch at a time whether it's your head or your skirt there's no such thing because the enemy will not stop until a woman who is sold out to God has embraced first one thing then another thing then another thing then another thing then another thing a and now now they wear slacks to church Pentecostals now the women wear slacks to church hair all cut and perm Med colored unnatural colors that God never even placed on any child's head when they were born come on now there there's just no stopping to are you going to preach this way the whole two hours I might if I think you don't want me to I might but I want you to understand that it's not these individual things that matter I'm not even saying that all these little things are big deals some of them are not big deals but the prophet Isaiah said whatever's going on has caused the women to be proud to be hoty to look down on other people in in a in almost a self-righteous way how many of you know there should be no bride Pride either but by the grace of God there go you and I we could have followed the trend we could have followed the fad we could have followed the downslide of the Pentecostal church but God called us out not so that we could turn around 30 years later and follow their Trends he called us out so that we could stand in resistance to what the church has become not in judgment but in shining glowing the goodness and the grace of Jesus Christ to a world that's around us unsettled unsure unanchored the church has become unanchored because she doesn't have much of an absolute anymore amen she couldn't stop with a wedding band or just some simple ring she had to have a great big old Diamond just like the Pentecostal Church world just like the world out there and you take that on the next thing you know then that same old Godly sister next thing you know she'll have to have a mother ring and a grandmother's ring now she's got a whole collection of of necklaces and things her husband has given her now her older Sons will start giving her and she can't hurt their feelings and and she's gotten so in love with these dainties that now she asks for them for Christmas she tells them what she wants so that she can then tell others who might mention it I didn't buy it for myself it was bought for me by someone else and now we see sisters who are are using the mascara brother Bram called it manicure and now we see the sisters who can't stop with that it gets thicker and thicker and thicker and thicker green blue purple yellow hello the prophet Isaiah oh my there was a time that when I preached like this you couldn't hear me for the people you're proving my point you're proving my point some of us have drifted so far from the absolute that we're in shock we can't say Amen CZ we're in shocked that we've gone back to that our enemies even criticize us the critics of this message even criticize it us because they say they change their rules as often as any other church and they never even tell anybody when they're changed when was it all right when was it all right to start doing such and such and be a part of the end time bride of Jesus Christ is it really about all these things it really is because the abundance of the inside are you with me I don't want that hotess in this church I don't want us to walk under that kind of a thing so let's ask the Holy Ghost to guide us let's ask the spirit of the lord always you won't hear me going around condemning you I rarely say things like this I'm not here to make you mad I'm not here to give you indigestion I'm just here to remind you that from time to time we need to stop and re-evaluate ourselves and see if we're tinkling like the Pentecostal are we tinkling like the world or are we shining with the light of the love of Jesus Christ are you with me you know these women that he's talking about some of these descriptions we don't understand unless we look them up some of them are perfume boxes can you imagine walking around with your perfume box in your hand this is not our culture but it was some of the Heathen cultures of the day so here are the daughters of Zion walking around with their mirrors tied to their wrist and their perfume boxes in their hand SAS and let's don't get the twist out you know and the prophet looks at it he sees it and sees it and sees it until one day the word of the Lord comes bubbling up out of him and he said you you're so much like the other nations long gone are the days that people could see us and and know what we stood for long gone are the days that people would say they're those Jesus Freaks long gone are the days that they would say that's those Jesus name baptized people there because the church has slid so far back and he begins to prophesy he begins to talk about all of the different things the the r nose rings and the and the jewels and the boring of the ear so that they becomes I'm not here to condemn anybody but just watch the trends then first the bank then the rest I saw it the women the Pentecostal church quit stopped preaching against women with earbobs and so then the men started getting them and and now look when the man first started wearing earrings they called him gay they called him Gay and now he's so confused he doesn't know what it is the world is so messed up now they've so blurred the genders that they're spending government tax dollars as I told you last Sunday to to uh investigate research the the monthly cycles of transgendered men that shouldn't take long you can change the anatomy but but it's it's a little bit harder on the inside Plumbing sometime you you can hormone the whiskers off you can hormone the deep voice off but that doesn't mean you can so just because a man is transgender doesn't mean he's going to start having a monthly cycle but government your tax money paying for such as that are you trying to tell us that you believe that these things are fruits of the mixing and blending of the Gingers and what the church used to cry absolutely I believe we're reaping the Harvest because nobody would tell it when it got unpopular to tell it in the message and I'm moving on eventually when their eyes were open they knew him toir California paragraph 112 brother vandom said and then the daughters of Zion would walk hoty in the last days they would fail to walk after the Lord no matter what you say to them you can just preach and preach and preach it's just like hitting against that wall over there it's a dense Darkness upon them there is seems to be so hard to find a genuine man that's man and and and to find a woman that's really a lady come on look look upon the streets today upon the screens our screens and wherever it is these uncensored programs I want you to notice what brother brandom's talking about his uncensored program cigarette smoking oh this greatly Disturbed brother brandom that Lucy smoked she wore pedal pushers long shorts like they call Capri called them pedal pushers then and smoked and brother Brandon was so disturbed by that what in this world do you think that he would think about what they do on television today all manner of things say all manner of things he said smoking cussing carrying on dressing like man and things Jesus said those things would be and they're here he said they don't need no revealing they are ready already revealed he said now watch as it was in the days of lot look at the setting of lot God come down and in two man went down into Sodom and preached down in Sodom one man sat up there with Abraham the elected Church type of the Pentecostal called out today not in Sodom out there those who live among Pentecostals women who cut their hair and man who carry on like that and tell those dirty jokes and carry on they're not Pentecostals they're just carrying a name Pentecostal he said they're not Pentecostal genuine Pentecostal ladies are and genuine Pentecostal man are man he said the schools almost having to close for young verted boys being perverts and things like that in the school homosexuals all over everywhere it's just a sickening sight as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man he just typed it to the word it's the downward Trend it's the slippery slope and if it was only out there we could lock ourselves away in some little box somewhere but it's not just out there it'll creep right in among us if we don't make a stand and you ought to amen the word if you have to follow it with an oh me is this the thing that matters the most no it doesn't matter the most what matters the most is are you born again are you washed in the blood of Jesus Christ baptized in his name Sanctified by the word filled with the Holy Ghost that is the main thing but there are other things that follow the main attraction and these are those things come out from among them amen and be separate sayeth the Lord is anybody with us so this was purum this week wasn't it could I encourage somebody just to turn the the I think it may be the monitor might be there just down just a hair because I I'm holding back a little bit because I think I'm loud and it won't be extra loud we were looking at purum it is a it's a Time the Bible mentions mentioned in the Bible it means Lots because the casting of lots was going on in the story and you know a little bit about it and and and and what a perfect time to look at Esther just a little bit before we go home today in the scripture if you were to call her by Hebrew name it would be hadassa Esther is a Persian name it's a name that she would have carried living in the Persian Kingdom where she was living her Hebrew name would have been hadasa and there is something about Esther there's something about hadasa that stands in such open contrast to the description that we just read about the daughters of Zion they had a mentality the more put on the more beautiful I am Esther had a different mentality she said if he's going to love me he's got to love me for who I am if he finds attraction in me it's going to have to be my character it's going to have to be my demeanor it's going to have to be my spirit because I'm not attracted to the things that the other girls seem to be so attracted to are you are you here and and I I think it would be good to look at this for just a moment in Esther chap 2 verse 1-3 after these things when the wrath of King azeris was appeased he remembered vashy and I noticed that some people pronounce it Vash Tha it doesn't matter to me how you pronounce it we'll get it and what she had done and what was decreed against her does anybody remember that vashy was the wife she was the queen of King aashis also known as Xerxes and she had been called by the king to a feast and she showed him the ultimate disrespect by refusing his invitation to come and appear and sit by his side at this great banquet that he had uh called and let's look at it here after these things when the wrath of King azeris was appeased he remembered vashy and what she had done at what was decreed against her then said the king's servants that ministered unto him let there be fair young virgins sought for the king he had put her away because she refused to come to him and uh so let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom that they may gather together all the fair young virgins un shushan the palace to the house of the women under the custody of heay the king's Chamberlain Keeper of the women and let their things for purification be given them we find that Esther was a woman of grace and favor she was a woman who unselfishly surrendered her life to please the king and to save her people from Ultimate destruction history records that the king the kingdom of King azeris stretched all the way from India to Ethiopia I don't know if you've got a bind to remember the the map the geography in your mind I didn't bring a map with me to show you but from India to Ethiopia a king azeris owned that was his kingdom he ruled in that massive piece of land massive land he was perhaps the richest landowner of his time we read that the kingdom had a headquarters it had a capital and the capital was called what shushan and shushan do you know what shushan means it means Lily the city of the Lily we know in the Bible that Lily is a symbol of the BR Paradigm we read in the Song of Solomon I am my beloveds and my beloved is mine he feedeth among the lies in the story of Esther there's about to be a royal wedding in The Lily City stay with me in the third year of the reign of King azaris also known as Xerxes he made a feast for all of his princes and his servants he wanted to show them The Riches of his kingdom it sounds like he had a little pride too verse four of chapter 1 tells us that the feast that he prepared lasted six months when it was over he invited local towns people to come for a feast at the palace that lasted seven days so six months and another week they have feasted they have celebrated the kingdom of King Aeris every guest you talk about a party favor every guest that came to the feast was given vessels of gold each one a little different from the next but every one of them having great value I I I've carried a few goodie bags home a popcorn and a candy bar how many of you think about going to a feast where you'd be given a golden vessel almost retirement uh in your in your bag as you were leaving there and they were filled these vessels were sealed and filled with the Royal Wine of the king that no commoner had ever tasted the story of Esther begins with the king's wife vashy who was known to be the most beautiful woman in the whole Kingdom of King azeris she started to behave herself unseemingly as a queen and she showed it publicly before the entire Kingdom her complete disrespect for her husband refusing to appear at his banquet she's then put away by the king follow the story she's put away by the king and he begins a search for a new Queen Fair virgins from throughout the land were sought for the king to inspect and to choose his next Queen in in Esther chap 2:7 there is a devout Jew who's mentioned how many of you know his name his name is Mori some would say Mori both are correct he had been raising his cousin Esther she was not his niece the Bible said she was the daughter of his uncle how many of you know that would have made her a first cousin and not a niece Mori loved Esther he loved hadassa as his own daughter her parents had been brutally murdered and he had taken her in as his own he loved her like she was his own daughter morai began to hear that the King was taking in Fair virgins for a purification process that would end in King azeris choosing a new Queen morai grabbed Esther by the arm and ran with her as fast as he could to the Palace because he knew that this was his opportunity to preserve and to protect his people the Jews why were they in Persia because they had been taken captive there she hid herself among the people as a Jewish she didn't tell people who she was no one really knew her true identity they had been keeping it very quiet her in entire life Mori told Esther in scripture don't show your people don't show your Kindred don't let anybody know who you are don't tell anybody where you're from he knew there was great danger in her revealing her true identity if she told somebody who she was her life could be taken because even as it is in our day there were Jew haters in high places in the days of Esther and Mori many virgins from all over the kingdom now you just think about the contrast between the the the complexion and the features of a woman from India the complexions and features of a woman from Ethiopia and everything in between there must have been some beautiful young women gathered in uh as candidates for the next Queen I can only imagine it must have been more beautiful than a modern uh beauty contest all of them vying competing desperate to be the queen you know why because they wanted the curlers and they wanted the bracelets and they wanted all the Royal things they wanted to enjoy the lifestyle all the things that Esther didn't really care anything about they wanted they were jealous they were envious come on they wanted to outdo one another and here comes little Esther into the mix they came from all over their goal was to stand out from the rest I've got to I've got to be prettier I've got to walk more sensual I've got to be more appealing than all of the other candidates if I don't I'll be lost in the crowd he won't find me as special he won't choose me and each one was told to request the thing things that she would require in order for her to be the most desirable to the king that he might choose her before she would do this she had to go through a purification process that lasted an entire year can you imagine in Esther 212 we're going through this quickly and yes I'm reading it now when but I wrote it so I can read it now when every maid's turn was come to go into king azeris after that she had been 12 months according to the manner of women completely locked away from society for so were the days of their purifications accomplished to it six months with oil of myrrh and six months with sweet odors and with other things for the purifying of the women they bathed in these amazing costly oils they rinsed off dried off and then they were Anointed with these oils the oils were rubbed into their skin so that one year later there was no need for deodorant there was no need for perfume the the fragrance of these costly oils myrr and sweet odors was it literally soaked into the same cells of their body and when they walked they smelt like a garden can you imagine it would have been an amazing thing it said now when every Mage turned this was six months in myrr and six months in sweet odors where sister Anita wrote that you know she wrote that song I may have given you the words uh I don't want to jump around too much but sister Anita wrote this song saturated in your presence as your oil flows down from heaven washing deep inside of me it's a mixture of suffering that's myrrh a bitter a bitter herb a bitter oil and blessing that's the sweet perfumes it's a mixture of suffering and blessing until I come out say that again would you not like you not like the world not like Canaanites amalekites like you wherever I walk your scent flows from me emitting the fragrance of the Lamb I want to take just a minute since some of you are in in a strange place right now I want to take just a minute to read you again and EXP experience that I had in the spirit concerning little Esther and I'm going to read it as the familiar scenery of my bedroom faded away I realized I was entering the realm of spiritual vision I saw a young lady standing in front of me she was attractive but not particularly beautiful she had a long slender neck and strong facial features it was evident to me that there was something very special about this young woman suddenly I Heard a Voice proclaiming from the spirit for such a time as this I immediately recognize this young lady to be Esther the biblical hadassa heroine of the Jewish people The Voice then spoke this is the appointed time suddenly I began to see something falling down on her it looked like rain it appeared to be small drops of beautiful golden oil they were teardrop shaped and transparent and I could see by the way they fell on her that the drops were heavy I perceived that they were drops representing his glory representing the atmosphere of Heaven and the Manifest presence of Jesus a remarkable transformation was unfolding in this shower of God's glory I could still see her young strong features but there was an ex exquisite beauty that now began to radiate from her that was not present just a few moments ago the glory had anointed her the glory had transformed her the glory had changed her she was being prepared for her Destiny transfigured before my eyes Queen Esther beautifully exemplifies the Bride of Jesus Christ as his bride you and I too are going through significant preparation to fulfill God's plan for our lives how about an amen for six months she was anointed with myrr a spice that represents suffering suffering is a necessary ingredient in our preparation process but remember I want you to remember that suffering is only a portion of the recipe after 6 months of myrr she was anointed for six additional months with sweet smelling spices one of these spices was calamus its root meaning speaks to us of divine order the number 12 the total number of months in their preparation it communicates government not just any government but the government of almighty God it's time listen it's time for the government it's time it's time I feel that it's time for the divine order and the government of the Lord to be reflected in our lives instead of chaos instead of confusion instead of panic instead of anxiety instead of worldliness instead of paganism it's time that this little bride begin to reflect the divine order and the Divine government of God he's an ordered God he's a God who is meticulous in design and in desire are you here uh so it goes on it's time for the divine order and government of the Lord to be reflected in our lives it is time to discover how he wants his business conducted in the Earth this is what I've been asking him for so long now another one of these spices was frankincense a fragrance whose Aroma is only released when it's burned it is either has to be distilled or burned for it to release any fragrance at all it smells otherwise just Earthly the resin itself just smells earthy but the real fragrance of Frankincense is only released through the burning process or a distilling with hot water or steam it's the only way you can get the fragrance at all in fact we should now implore the Lord I want this fill us with a Holy Fire that we may emit all of his fragrance to a hopeless generation that while rejecting religious trappings Longs for reality and fulfillment we recognize that all the young female candidates underwent the same process of purification and anointing before their moment with the King But ultimately it was the king's decision who he would choose who would be his Queen in my experience erience I believe it was only after all the months of grooming and preparation had concluded that she began to be showered with a golden Glory a rain set from heaven for an appointed time transforming her to reflect everything that Jesus is thus making his Beauty visible in her the Bride of Jesus has been enduring lengthy days months and years of preparation we have experienced both the pain of myrr and the profound blessing of his sweetness and yet we persevere and yet we press on because we know that God is preparing us for a quick short work to manifest the very character and life of Jesus Christ in the Earth are you here verse 13 chapter 2 then thus came every Maiden unto the king whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women into the king's house one by one one by one they all had their evening they all had their appointment with King aeras some took snacks some thought the king would be Bunchy and they took Pringles or whatever the uh snack of the day was they took bags vessels to impress the king some would spread a banquet for him they would choose their down many of them very provocative hoping for an opportunity to have familiar relations with the King and to make that moment so impressive that he would without a doubt choose them one by one they were rejected they came with their gowns they came with their oders they came with their fans they came with their snacks they came with all of their trappings they were allowed to ask for anything in the king's possession that that they desired to make themselves more appealing to make themselves more desirable after all it was a contest it was a it was an ancient Survivor like they have in in modern days not Survivor uh Bachelor or Bachelorette or something like that where they line up these all these women uh to try out for men and vice versa it was sort of like that with no no TV cameras this was real life do you understand stand every Maiden would then gather the things they desired some gathered makeup some various cosmetics and and lotions and jewelry fashionable accessories and extravagant gowns and and brooches and pins for their hair even exotic gifts from the king's own treasure room and they were hoping that he would see something that he particularly adored and they would pin them on their cloth and they would go in hoping that he would see his own treasure and he would think oh what a thoughtful what a thoughtful young lady she is to bring my most treasured uh possession to wear it in here they were looking for a strategy they wanted to be more appealing to the king just like the women of Zion wanted to be more appealing to the outside Community just like the women around the message want to be more accepted when they go to Walmart they don't want to be looked at as quite fogy they don't want to be looked at as pilgrims they want to be as fashionable as possible they want to have as much color as they can possibly have without what you'd say smearing it on they want to have as many tinkling sounds so they can fit in with everybody else but I want you to know Esther had another strategy if Esther represents the bride then the bride better have another strategy we better have another strategy you better hear what I'm saying now we better have another strategy to capture the attention of the king anything they believed would get them chosen anything they made assumptions it's not a good idea to make assumptions about what pleases him we've got the manual we've got the book he tells us what pleases him you've got to know the manual you've got to know the book you've got to eat the book you've got to become a part of the book and the open book to be a part of you so that he's attracted I want you to know something the bridegroom is attracted to the word he is the word it's not your your Earthly smell it's not your Earthly trinkets gadgets and and and add-ons that draws his favor it's a people that are transformed by the word amen I'm going to take just another minute take a little water pause a moment hallelujah praise God we're getting through it but Esther oh no Esther desired and requ ired and requested nothing but only what the king's unic had charge of her he selected did you know this unic you know what that means don't you castrated he was a servant totally sold out the king never had to worry about him being among the heram he was totally dedicated it appears that Esther found some unusual favor in his eyes because the Bible says that he specifically chose a few to serve and to help Esther and to prepare Esther and he pulled them away into a safe place and she began to inquire of him what the king is like hear me tell me what he's like tell me what he loves tell me what he's interested in can you tell me what his favorite fragrance is can you tell me how he wants his Queen to dress can you tell me what he finds beautiful I want you to know she was a smart little girl she wasn't going to assume what she could use to to gain his favor she was going to find out what he liked aren't you glad you know I'll pull you I'm going to pull you if I have to I'm GNA pull you I'm going pull you I may not want to preach this any more than you want to hear it but I'm going to pull you all the way I may remind you from time to time verse 15 of chapter 2 now when the turn of ES the daughter of Abel the uncle of Mori who had taken her for his daughter was come to go in into the king she required nothing nothing but what he gave and and some people put an eye on it but the eye is not there in the Hebrew but in English you can certainly put it you can say uh higi the king's Chamberlain The Keeper of the women appointed just whatever he suggested and Esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her and the Bible only records 6 months of my six months of sweet fragrance sweet odors and with other things that women are purified by and that's all she took in we don't know much about her gown we don't know much about anything else that she carried with her but we are led to to assume and to believe that she just went in like that and yet attractive and beautiful to everyone who looked upon her without all the stuff that the other girls carried brother brandham says in the mean a message called the meanest man in Santa Maria paragraph 83 do you think you know that man the meanest man in Lee County and the new birth is the same thing it's a mess but it comes life out of that mess only way you can receive life is through a birth it's messy but it makes life people try to dodge it they don't want to wash the manicure off their face some of them now I want you to know brother brandom didn't know what a manicure was he goes on to say what is that you call that stuff not not manicure mascara he said that's what it is I don't know what that crazy stuff is can you imagine 1962 I I don't know what that crazy you you you'd look a whole lot prettier if you wouldn't wear that you would try a little Acts 2 and acts 4 it'll beat all that Max Factor ever could make I still believe that brother brandom I still believe that I'll tell you that he said if you'll just try a little of that it'll be an eternal Beauty a sweet Meek quiet Spirit he said that's what this woman had that's what Esther had when she come before the king that's the reason she overrun the other girls because she come adorning herself with a sweet spirit before him remember I'll beautify the meek with salvation isn't that what he said I'll make them beautiful I'll make them the most beautiful and he does he does I want you to know a man with his with his heart in the right place and living by the word he finds Holiness the most beautiful expression on on a woman a man that can't be satisfied unless his wife puts red on her lips has been looking at too many porn uh pornographic magazine a man that comes home with uh uh stilettos and and and needs his wife to walk around the house like that as a brother once come and told me in this this church that he needed his wife to do things like that and I said I want you to know something she is not obligated to perform for you dress up like some maid if that's what it takes for you to care about your wife and show her intimately that you love her you need Deliverance if a man who's married to a Godly woman can't get turned on unless she's in red high heel shoes something is wrong with that man and it won't go away he won't outgrow it oh yes he said that's this woman she had a when she come before the king she overran the other girls we know that she came before him with the sweet Spirit Esther didn't strive to collect what she believed would be best for her but she understood that the king had his own personal preferences I think sometime that people forget that the one we serve has his own preferences and I think it's ignorant of us to want to give him an apple pie if he prefers a cherry pie well I'm going to change him he's never tasted my apple pie if he don't like apple pie your apple pie is not going to be any better than anybody else's apple pie why don't you just make him a cherry pie why don't we discover what pleases the Lord and surrender to that I don't care how crazy it seem well you're living a pretty narrow life there's more out there than cherries it's hard for me to preach on Cherry Pie because I'm not a cherry pie fan but brother brandham said he was so I use cherry pie sometime I I there's a lot of pies I like better than a cherry pie but if I like that I wouldn't want my wife to try to change me and and and and I find most apple pies are are just just average plane but I have had some that made me want to be an apple pie lover and I had at least one Cherry one cherry pie that made me think cherry pie could be good but I've never had another one since you understand why don't we just find out what he likes if he wants a woman to have uncut hair what's the big deal if that pleases him somebody say well I want to please my husband well if your husband is any way in any way normal he would probably prefer and if he serves God I know he would prefer I was sitting with brother Perry green at a charismatic prophetic conference in Tucson it was convened by a woman preacher we were there testifying of the ministry of brother brandham I knew brother green was going to embarrass me me I loved him he's one of my best friends but I knew he was going to embarrass me so he looks over there at the quiet husband of a very vocal woman preacher and he calls him by name I won't and he said I want to ask you something he said don't you think and you did like this he said don't you think and he called her name don't you think she'd look prettier if she had long hair there said his preacher wife man's hair do he turned every color in the book he looked at her she looked at him he looked back and he said yes sir I believe she would he might have been getting a whooping when he got home but he couldn't help but be honest the reality is it doesn't matter what Ron oops that was his name doesn't matter what Ron liked what matters is what does he want what does the king like what pleases him that's what we better be figuring out okay preach on I believe it will but I won't be much longer you see you look at that you look at the very word haay the unic the Chamberlain you know what it means it means a seriousness it means meditation it means pondering he was a man known to ponder the situation to meditate the situation and so he figured if I share with her the king's true desires she will then be the one that is chosen and he was right he was right while all the others did what they thought they should do she would have to learn what the king would desire from her she dared not assume anything to assume means to venture without Authority she DED not presume to do what she felt she should do to presume means to take something for granted it couldn't be about Esther it couldn't be hear me now even if you're mad even if you're all bit out of shape even if you don't like me anymore hear me it couldn't be about Ester it could not be about Esther she could not fight for her rights and please the king she couldn't say I don't care what he likes I'm just going to be me it couldn't be about Esther it had to be about the king why because the very future she didn't know what Mori was talking about but she believed him she loved him she trusted him he said how do we know how do we know that God is not going to use you it it's possible that God is going to use you to save your people he didn't even perhaps know at the moment he hadn't got to for such a time as this yet he might not have even known the full impact of it at the moment but he knew he wanted her to be the queen she's got to be the queen she's got to be the queen the message conflict between God and Satan brother Bram said the bride must be unified together by the word my sheep hear my voice this is his voice on printed word printed page I'm sure uh unified by the word she makes herself ready not with the regular Creed like Esther when Esther was to be chosen to stand before the king she didn't Adorn themselves with all the things she adorned herself with a sweet sweet Meek Spirit that's what the bride is adorning herself with with all the fruits of the spirit following it what she got assembling together in The Fellowship of the word amen Fellowship of the word that's right fellowshipping sitting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Jesus tonight one Accord one place one Spirit one mind one hope one God one purpose amen can I have some time thank you the marriage of the Lamb paragraph 145 said he's going to have a bride that hasn't got a wrinkle in her amen she's wholly Washed by the blood of his own self see so we see where we stand the wedding's getting ready to come I will hurry but I want to finish this now we find how she commits spiritual fornication s going out with the world professing something living different something different that won't never work what the church ought to do is do like Esther did Esther refused the adorning of the world we know that little Book of Esther how that mori's Uncle had a daughter and was down during the times of the Reigns of the mes and the Persians a very beautiful type here uh or there the king one of the greatest kings in the world that day had a great feast called the queen to come set by him but she wouldn't do it she refused to do it so what did he do he was so humiliated he didn't know what to do his own wife wouldn't come when he called anybody ever experienced that frustration I've even asked my wife please don't tell me I'll be right there in a few minutes please don't i' I'd almost rather you say nothing then to tell me I'll get there when I can I I don't want I'm not a I'm not a a tyrant I want you to know that if I am God help me deliver me I don't want to be that way but but don't you don't you want to your wife to hear you when you call to her don't you want her to put her phone down long enough to hear what you need or what you have to say maybe you want to whisper sweet nothing in her ear or something and in order to do that you'd have to separate her from her phone do you understand what I'm saying I know you're not going to say am man because she's sitting right beside you I think that that's a whole lot like Christ today he said Christ has invited us to sit in Heavenly places with him and we're ashamed of it he said many people are ashamed to say they got the baptism of the Holy Ghost Pentecostal people they're ashamed to say it that's right they're ashamed to say it we're ashamed of him and so the queen wouldn't come she refused to come it humil humiliated him his face turned red everybody noticed I wonder if Jesus's face don't turn a little red too when he calls on us for a work calls on the Pentecostal movement for fellowship and Brotherhood and we're so tightly organized in little groups till we won't Bend for the other hello we're so getting so early in things we're getting ashamed of the name of Pentecost you better not tell people around this message that you're Pentecostal in any shape form or fashion they don't like it it's a curse word I'm going to tell him every time I get the opportunity because brother brandham said he was he said I'm glad I got a Pentecostal experience experience amen I'm glad to Bear the name of Jesus Christ it's the greatest privilege I ever had to say I'm what part of him now we find out that then he got some Consultants to ask what he must do and they said if this goes on like this all the rest of the women throughout the country will take it take example of the first lady if she refuses to come and and he said that's what's happening tonight I hope I don't hurt your feelings and yet I do he said I hope I do uhoh right trying to be this here first lady stuff with these Waterhead haircuts he's talking about Miss Jackie he said I never seen such a thing in all my life the other day there was a woman com up in the store where I was waiting for my wife that woman's head was that big she had green paint under her eyes I said go back Boogeyman I'll be good brother brandom said some mighty funny things in this sermon you should hear it marriage of the lamb in fact a few times he'd have to sayi not telling jokes but that's pretty funny go back Boogeyman I'll be good it was awless sight it would scare you I I've been scared myself first lady it's the first lady that's it and they take an example by that let me say this now I didn't say it jokingly being but par now he's not talking about the first lady of a church but it matters it matters how she dresses it matters how she lives he's talking about the first lady of a Nation he said you'd see that's exactly what you older Christians are doing for these younger you're supposed to be let's say that again you're supposed to be examples when you start seeing the old women think they've got to put on the paint and the powder I saw old women when I was sitting in Tennessee a few weeks ago I saw Grandma that didn't e it Lord have mercy those sweet round faces of an Old Saint an old grandma that's fought the fight and kept the faith and come down to the end of her life and now all of a sudden she feels like she's got to pain up what a sad shame that's right it is what a shame it is so the consultants and so forth and go on where are we you Pentecostals who profess to have the Holy Ghost you're to be an example for the Methodist Baptist Presbyterians not like the vers lady but like Jesus You're supposed to be he tells you in here what to do how to do it we must follow his rules and examples but that's the way we find eser what a hero she really was right he said this queen she wouldn't listen to it she wouldn't come she humiliated him if this first lady of the land sets an example like that all the rest of the ren will do it so when a man calls for his wife she'll say go jump in the river see boy he really foretold America didn't he he said now we find out that in doing so there was a man that had some wisdom about him come up and counsel the king he said the thing to do is excommunicate her send her out through the nation and call in The Virgins the young virgins and there pick yourself a wife I remember this was a Persian king this this wasn't a Jewish King this wasn't a Hebrew king this was a pagan King Persians and mes it pleased the king I guess it did so he sent out the chambermaids and I believe that's chamberlains and so forth pick all the young virgins that could the beautiful women throughout all the kingdom the provinces that he was over which was the greatest in the world and when she did it come to a little Jewish girl she's rather a kind of an offcast that's how I saw her she wasn't very beautiful when I first saw her in the spirit in a symbol in a vision she wasn't all that pretty but oh my when you're saturated in the glory when you are saturated by the glory of God there is a beauty that comes out of you that you'd never possess before because it's him making you to be beautiful hello she's kind of an O cast like the Gentiles you see cast off to one side she had no father and mother and Mori her uncle was Raising her and she had to go to qualify we know it was a cousin he's already said that earlier that she was the daughter of his uncle and so what did they they they had to take these girls in for purification many months had to perfume them do all kinds of adorning fix them all up so they could go before the king now that's just about the way the world wants to fix the church are you still with me I know it's long I don't usually to read them this long this's a long one he said that's the way the want to CH Adorn it with the world pattern after the things trying to get more members taking it in anything in their Fellowship my it's a pitiful thing one organization trying to beat the other one take anything in for a member you might take them in this organization but they'll never come into the fellowship of Christ until they're cleaned up and born again in the spirit of God woo they might have their name on the book here but not up there on the Lamb's Book of Life till it's wrote with the blood of the Lord Jesus how many of you appreciate that kind of preaching I do he said all the women they fix themselves all up look pretty oh I imagine they got really some looks on them maybe the first lady and so forth they got themselves all fixed up because they was going to appear before the king I think that's about the whole lot is getting the matter with our churches today they're trying to fix themselves up worldly having worldly entertainment worldly things in it doing things of the world associating in the world thinking they can meet the king God don't care about that he hates that but we want to we want to act like the world some of our churches I've said they've let down the bars taking in deacons and so forth in the church and sometimes pastors that's married four or five times some of them smoke cigarette he said they'll they'll get over it they'll be all right get a man out of a barroom one night and put him in the pull pit the next night I don't believe in no such stuff I believe a man is got to be proved that's right proved I tell you A lot of times we we call a lot of times we call he said I believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe in speaking in tongues but I think we lay too much emphasis on that a man can speak with tongues and a woman speak with tongues and if her life and his life doesn't compare with what tongues you're speaking in then it's the wrong tongue CA the holy spirit will make you act like the Bible you're going to argue with me over some little trinket you want to wear the holy spirit will make you act like the Bible it'll bring you to the fullness of the stature of Christ when it was her turn to go in before the king we read this in 21718 and the King loved Esther above all the women oh my some of them come dancing like a alleycat can you imagine can you imagine how some of them come slithering in like snakes to capture the king's attention she just walks in she didn't need all that crud she didn't need spiders on her eyelids she just was Meek and humble beautiful oh beautiful lot of you Brothers Here fell in love with beautiful women who didn't look like the world don't you let them start looking like the world now and don't you sorry thing turn your head to look at one of this world's hag while your Godly wife is standing beside you if You Do Your Dirty Dog you tell them I said so cuz you can't expect her to be one way and then turn your head to watch some splitt tail gal walk down through the you make up your mind I'm not looking I'm not looking perhaps one of the reasons why some want to go out there to find their companion because if you're not fully Sanctified those are the thing a a tight pair of jeans with a little honey showing is the kind of thing that a young man will find attractive if he's not filled with enough of the Holy Ghost it's not right for you to expect your wife and then you turn and look at somebody El don't you dare do it I hope I hope she pops you oh the pastor's exciting violence I do I hope she kicks you where it counts that's wrong Amen brother am it was it was she caught your attention she was the prettiest thing you'd ever seen and many of you she wasn't painted and she wasn't in tight jeans and she wasn't looking like you saw that dress you you saw that hair you you you thought everything about her was the most wonderful thing now don't you try to make her anything other than that the king loved Esther above all the women and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins so that he set the Royal Crown upon her head and made her Queen instead of vashy then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and servants even Esther's feast and he made release to the provinces and gave gifts according to the state of the king she was chosen why not because she was more intelligent or even more physically beautiful than the rest she was chosen because she pleased the king she found out what he loved and that's how she went in she found out he wasn't for feisty women so she went in with who she was humble me hello she investigated as Believers it's imperative that we find out what pleases the king what he desires we need a Chamberlain we need a pastor we need a teacher we need a Ministry who is surrender to the influence and Leadership of the Holy Ghost we need the Holy Ghost in our own lives as individuals to witness to us the truth of what pleases our King the best way to discover what the king wants along with his likes and dislikes is to read the word of God it is his love letter to us people who try to get away with as much carnality and worldliness as they can have simply never fallen in love with our bridegroom King those who embrace the fads and Fashions of our secular society are undoubtedly pursuing Another Love and and it is not the love of the Lord Jesus Christ one more quote and we're going to stop because I don't have time to finish the story but Tuesday night if you come I will because some Terrible Things begin to happen hymon there's a villain in every love story and hmon he shows up and he hates the Jews he was he was born of an amalekite and he hated the sight of Mori a dirty stinking Jew sitting at the Gate of the king but that's where he sat because his his cousin his little daughter the one he raised as a daughter was inside that Palace and he was going to make sure she was all right so he made his spot right outside the gate if she needs me I'll be here boy I could really get emotional this is a story of stories if she needs me I'll be right here and one day he needed her he made enemies just being a Jew and there was a decree made that all the Jews in the land not only the Royal City of shushan but in the land of all the Dominion of King haueris that all the Jews would die it had been 30 days since Esther had had an audience with the can you imagine 30 days had gone by and the King had not called for her to come to his bed chamber can you imagine the doubt that was running through her mind has he fallen out of love with me as quickly as he fell in love with me 30 days have gone by and he has not called and Mori has to catch a hold of her and say you got to go anyway she said you know it's death you know that it's death if I go to the king without him bidding me to come this is protocol we don't understand she said you know it could been the end of my life and that's when he said to her for such a time is this how do we know it could be that God has brought you to the kingdom for such a time as this and she went in she knocked on the door she opened the door of what could have been the last few seconds of her life and he could have easily said get out of here and don't ever appear before me again but he did not did he he held out his scepter and she went in and nailed and just reached up and touched the tip of his scepter he said I have a request he said anything you want I'll give it to you her being at the right place at the right time and being what the king desired her to be brought Deliverance she risked her own life she saved not only the life of her uncle but the life of her people there are Jews alive today because of the courage of an eser who was willing to wait for the favor of the king when they made a movie sometime back about one night with the king the question was asked in the Prelude of the movie can one night with the King make a difference it made all the difference in the world if she would have went in there smacking her gum twisting her tail I think he would have spit and throwed her out she didn't she went in like a lady and found favor in his side in the marriage of the Lamb same sermon musicians are coming I have four three or four paragraphs yet I want to read this I told you that brother brandham didn't refer to and that's because he didn't use the word pertaineth but I found that he used the word pertain here when we were studying Deuteronomy 22:5 he said lot of the Pentecostal women were in clothed that pertained to a man and God said it's an abomination in his sight that's right how you expect to go to heaven like that it shows the Holy Spirit isn't in there if the Holy Spirit was in there it would condemn you how many of you understand that if the Holy Spirit was there he can't bear witness to something that's against the word and I showed you I showed you I didn't just tell you believe what I believe I showed you in the word where it was wrong he said oh you might shout speak with tongues run up and down dance in the spirit said I've seen Hindus do that and Indians and everything else that don't mean nothing unless unless there's a life to back up what you're talking about power of the Holy Ghost to make Godly living people he said that's the bride of Christ he said Esther was to become a bride so she did didn't want none of the adorning of the world she wanted to go into the king just like she was she adorned them like the Pentecostal women ought to with a Meek humble spirit that doesn't mean to lay down so your husband can walk all over you if he loved you he's not Desiring to walk all over you he's Desiring to give his entire life if that's what's required of him for you and when all these fancy first ladies come by with all their new fandangle things the king looked at them and put them in the chamber with the concubines these were the fair virgins of the land he sent them out to where the prostitutes were he looked at them about the same way cheap they were cheap to him but when this Esther come into His sight and he got a glimpse of that sweet humble Meek Spirit he said that's her go get the crown go get the crown and put it on her head that's right let them Adorn themselves with that kind of spirit not only the women but the men too Adorn themselves with that kind of a spirit then you're becoming ready the bride sweet reverent Esther made her heart clean Above All Else guard your heart let's stand Jesus Lord I I thank you for a people who have sold out who have surrendered their lives to want to please you Lord sometimes along the way we lose sight of what you're really after and we start thinking more or less of how we can fit in the world around us but you didn't call us to fit in in fact you called us to stand out you called us to even be gazed at and looked at misunderstood and sometimes criticized and yet you told us that at the end of this thing those who have criticized those who have misunderstood those who have condemned would come and ask for our help if we would remain faithful and true Lord I Thank you for every Godly sister I thank you for every godly man in this house and those streaming the service Lord I Thank you that you have made provision for those of us who might have lost our way you're still drawing at the end of the day the things that we have mentioned the Holiness the standard that we have talked about that is not the ultimate goal if it were then that would make us all what you would desire for us to be if we got the uniform right we would all be pleasing in your sight but the reality is it wasn't what Esther wore it was who Esther was it was in fact the reality that she didn't have to put on the world but she just came in the beauty that you had given her that which you had bestowed upon her a Meek and sweet and kind and gentle Spirit she didn't stomp in with combat boots or Slither in in with the seductive Spirit of the world she humbly walked in and she walked out of there wearing the king's crown Lord I Thank you for every person under the sound of my voice that has made such a commitment I pray for those that have found themselves this morning with a little bit of this and a little bit of that creeping in I know some don't understand my fogy ways but the reality is I've lived now long enough to watch the trend a little compromise here a little adjustment here and the next thing you know the world has stepped right Among Us and there's nothing that we can do to stop the sand from flying out of The Hourglass Lord I ask today that you would strengthen those who have made such a stand to be pleasing in your sight I thank you that you didn't leave us here without a manual you gave us your word you showed us in that book what you desired it was not our sacrifices it was our obedience that you were looking for you desire a broken and contrite spirit humble and meek no Hess no arrogance No self-righteousness in fact no judgment for anybody else I must have a madeup mind to live it you must have a madeup mind to live it Lord that's how you've left it it's it's it's the individual we can't focus on rules and regulations we have to focus on relationship the closer we get to you the less like this world we want to be and the less attraction we have to the Trinkets and Treasures that the world values Lord more than anything else we want to spend time with you we want a night with the King we want a moment in your presence to feel your love and to know that no matter what comes our
