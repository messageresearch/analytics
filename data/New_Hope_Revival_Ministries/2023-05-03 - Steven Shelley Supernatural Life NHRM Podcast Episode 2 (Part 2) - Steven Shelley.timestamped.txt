[0:10] Shelley and I'd like to welcome you back
[0:12] to the nhrm podcast this is going to be
[0:14] part two with not only my dad but my
[0:16] pastor Stephen Shelley and first off I'd
[0:19] like to thank you so much for the
[0:21] response that we got from the first
[0:23] podcast it was unbelievable we were
[0:26] looking at it right before we started
[0:27] filming this and it was around 1100
[0:29] views on YouTube and 1800 views on
[0:33] Facebook and that's not even including
[0:36] on the app or any of the other platforms
[0:38] that we have it on so just thank you
[0:39] from the bottom of my heart this it is
[0:42] super encouraging to see how well this
[0:44] has done I've had people come up to me
[0:47] that I would never think would sit down
[0:49] and listen to this and tell me how much
[0:51] they enjoyed it I've had text messages
[0:52] phone calls so just thank you once again
[0:55] I'm so happy and I can't wait to keep
[0:58] this going
[1:00] um and also I would like to say happy
[1:01] birthday he decided that on his 55th
[1:05] birthday he was gonna do a podcast with
[1:07] me so I'm excited happy birthday and uh
[1:09] I'm excited for this part too with you
[1:11] thank you so much
[1:13] 55 that's pretty big it's getting up
[1:16] there how about I read a birthday
[1:18] scripture go ahead this is what's in my
[1:20] heart today and I know we're doing a
[1:22] podcast but but uh five is the number of
[1:26] Grace and so when I think of being 55
[1:30] that's Grace Grace and that reminds me
[1:33] of an important prophetic scripture
[1:36] Joshua in Zachariah chapter 4 and verse
[1:41] 7. it says who art thou old great
[1:45] Mountain before zerubbabel
[1:48] Thou shalt become a plane and he shall
[1:51] bring forth The Headstone thereof with
[1:54] shoutings crying Grace Grace double five
[1:58] unto it moreover the word of the Lord
[2:01] came unto me saying the hands of
[2:04] zerubbabel have laid the foundation of
[2:06] this house his hands also finish it and
[2:10] thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts
[2:13] hath sent me unto you and then verse 10
[2:16] for who hath despised the day of small
[2:21] things for they shall rejoice and shall
[2:24] see the plummet in the hand of
[2:27] zerubbabel and that plummet is a Plumb
[2:30] line and this studio has been dedicated
[2:33] to the glory of God and we call it the
[2:36] plum line studio and so uh in the hand
[2:40] of zerubbabel with those seven they are
[2:42] the eyes of the Lord which are the
[2:44] Sevenfold Spirit of the Lord which run
[2:47] to and fro through the whole Earth Earth
[2:48] and I know that's a bit of a mystical
[2:51] sounding scripture prophetic but it
[2:54] means a lot to those of us who have
[2:56] embraced the message of the hour
[2:58] that headstone coming you know when they
[3:01] were building the pyramids the Pyramid
[3:04] of Giza uh that one main pyramid never
[3:09] received its headstone or the Capstone
[3:12] that sits on the top and brother Branham
[3:15] did some powerful preaching concerning
[3:18] the coming of that headstone with cries
[3:22] with shouts of Grace Grace so I'm
[3:26] keeping that in my mind today so that I
[3:28] don't feel too old Grace Grace well
[3:32] thank you for coming on on your birthday
[3:33] I know you could have been doing other
[3:34] stuff but I'm glad you decided to do
[3:36] this with me
[3:37] um
[3:38] before we start talking we kind of left
[3:40] off about where you how you came into
[3:42] the message and stuff but before we talk
[3:44] about that and keep going on your story
[3:47] let's go back a little bit and you
[3:49] wanted to correct something I remember
[3:50] you saying I do I I watch part of the uh
[3:55] podcast and I had forgotten that I had
[3:58] stumbled around just a little bit when
[4:00] you asked such a great question you
[4:03] asked me how old was my grandmother when
[4:06] I was telling you the story of how
[4:08] sister Alice Flanagan walked up on the
[4:11] porch and invited her to church I
[4:14] actually choked up when you asked me
[4:15] when I was telling it because I realized
[4:19] that she had always said that was the
[4:22] first time in her life that anybody
[4:24] invited her to church so you asked me
[4:27] how old she was and I I just kind of
[4:29] stumbled around thinking that she was
[4:31] born in the early 30s but in fact she
[4:33] was really born August the 9th of 1924.
[4:37] so uh in 1949 she was 25 years old so
[4:42] she had lived for 25 years on the earth
[4:45] without anybody everybody invited to
[4:48] church and uh you know that is
[4:51] incredible and it it I hope that someone
[4:54] will hear this and they will go ahead
[4:57] and get the courage that they've been
[4:59] looking for to invite somebody sure you
[5:02] know sometimes we think well our
[5:04] services are long and and and you know
[5:08] we're a loud church and we jump around a
[5:10] little bit and worship a little little
[5:12] uh expressively so maybe I won't invite
[5:16] but if the Lord puts it if you feel that
[5:18] urge that nudge to invite someone to
[5:22] church don't you think you ought to go
[5:23] ahead and do it for sure I do I think
[5:27] you should go ahead and do it and I'm so
[5:29] glad I'm so thankful I loved sister
[5:32] Flanagan very much she would come to
[5:35] visit my granny many years later uh she
[5:38] lived in Louisiana and she would come
[5:40] and visit my granny and I just I
[5:43] couldn't thank her enough because she
[5:45] invited my grandmother which you know
[5:48] really brought me into the faith yeah uh
[5:50] just being inviting people to church
[5:51] there's somebody I play softball with
[5:53] and he was we were talking the other day
[5:54] he's like what would your dad do if I
[5:56] walked in and I was like well he'll
[5:57] probably be shocked I said but he'd be
[5:59] more than welcome and I'd love for you
[6:01] to be there absolutely and that's just I
[6:04] mean sometimes like you said you just
[6:05] gotta have that courage just to invite
[6:06] that person and because you never know
[6:08] what they're going through either you
[6:09] don't you don't and church can be such a
[6:12] help for sure uh it can be such a
[6:14] comfort to get in the presence of the
[6:16] Lord and
[6:18] and and unity with with everyone with
[6:21] other believers and sometimes receive
[6:24] instruction you know advice from the
[6:27] Bible to help us navigate and it may be
[6:29] the most simple thing that you would
[6:30] look over but to them it's something big
[6:33] exactly right Joshua um now we wanted
[6:35] you wanted to talk about how your great
[6:37] grandmother I did because that's that is
[6:40] a pretty amazing story
[6:41] I mentioned in the last podcast maybe I
[6:44] would tell that sometime and and I'd
[6:46] like to do that it really fits in with
[6:48] what I just said about my grandmother
[6:51] her name was Mildred and she was 25
[6:53] years old when she was invited to church
[6:56] but she had had a pull toward God for
[7:00] many years but didn't know anything to
[7:03] do about it she told me and told many
[7:06] other people through my lifetime that
[7:08] many mornings she would wake up in her
[7:11] 20s and her pillow would be wet with
[7:14] tears where she had gone to bed at night
[7:16] praying for her loved ones to be saved
[7:19] when she herself had never really
[7:22] accepted the Lord she she really didn't
[7:24] know how but she knew that there was
[7:27] this relationship somehow building in
[7:31] her heart toward the lord and she didn't
[7:33] see that in any of her family
[7:35] you might remember that I told you that
[7:38] she had 15 brothers and sisters she was
[7:40] a twin uh her twin only lived for a
[7:44] little while and and uh passed away his
[7:47] name was Adam
[7:48] and my grandmother weighed four pounds
[7:50] when she was born just a tiny little
[7:53] little thing was she the oldest or no no
[7:56] she wasn't the oldest uh uh I glanced at
[8:00] it and her parents would have already
[8:01] been in their late 30s when she was born
[8:04] so she was one of the 15 there were
[8:08] several younger than she uh she actually
[8:11] had 16. my great-grandmother had 16
[8:15] children one passed away and she raised
[8:19] her nephew because his mother died her
[8:22] daughter at childbirth so she raised a
[8:26] grandson who later became he's passed
[8:28] away now but he later became a circuit
[8:31] court judge in Dothan Alabama really a
[8:33] very respected man and I don't know why
[8:37] I'm even telling this but one of the
[8:39] things that my grandmother liked to tell
[8:41] is that when he graduated from high
[8:43] school now that made my
[8:45] great-grandmother quite old raising a
[8:48] grandchild and uh the one of the things
[8:51] that was written in his annual is that
[8:53] he was the cleanest
[8:55] uh student and uh that meant a lot to my
[9:00] grandmother because she knew that her
[9:02] mother had washed his clothes on the old
[9:05] scrub board and had boiled them in a pot
[9:09] down by the by the Brook and uh sorry
[9:13] when she passed away my
[9:16] great-grandmother Lizzie the doctor said
[9:19] that her backbone was worn completely
[9:22] into
[9:23] and that she was a walking Miracle they
[9:26] did not know how she could walk with a
[9:29] severed spine and that had come from
[9:33] scrubbing the clothes for for 16
[9:35] children because she raised raised my uh
[9:38] her her grandson but anyway
[9:42] uh my grandmother said that growing up
[9:44] there was no talk about God much in her
[9:48] home uh I told you they were
[9:50] sharecroppers and that meant they didn't
[9:52] leave on their own land they they lived
[9:55] on somebody else's land and helped farm
[9:57] the land and uh my grandmother did say
[10:02] that on occasion they would go to a
[10:05] service they called it protracted
[10:08] meetings and that was at an old church
[10:10] not too far from the house
[10:12] where she grew up uh in in near near
[10:16] between Clayton and Clio Alabama
[10:19] um
[10:20] and that they would only have service
[10:22] like every five or six weeks there was a
[10:25] preacher who would travel like a circuit
[10:27] preacher and they called them protracted
[10:29] meetings and she would go and she said
[10:32] as I began to grow up I never got
[10:34] anything out of them because she said
[10:36] literally the preacher would be
[10:38] preaching his sermon and he would have
[10:40] to pause to go to the back door of the
[10:43] church and spit out his tobacco juice so
[10:45] that he could come back in and finish
[10:47] and even she not being a Christian
[10:49] she knew that wasn't much of a Preacher
[10:52] and so she just kind of made her own
[10:54] relationship with the Lord I want to
[10:56] tell this kind of funny story and then
[10:58] I'll get to the very special night
[11:01] uh because my grandmother only weighed
[11:04] four pounds
[11:05] she was scrawny as a little girl she was
[11:08] a very large woman later in life and and
[11:11] my name for her was not grandmother it
[11:13] was Big Mama and always called her that
[11:16] my whole life much to the uh aggravation
[11:19] of of my family but uh we had we had a
[11:23] mutual understanding and it didn't
[11:25] bother her a bit but anyway uh
[11:28] so she was so scrawny that she said her
[11:31] aunts would come to the house and they
[11:33] would line up uh the girls her sisters
[11:36] and they would say oh this one is so
[11:39] beautiful and that one is so beautiful
[11:41] so healthy because in those days if you
[11:44] were fat you were healthy you were
[11:46] skinny they thought you were sick and so
[11:49] my granny being so scrawny uh her aunts
[11:52] would just look at her and they'd go hmm
[11:54] and shake their head and feel sorry for
[11:56] her so she went out this is the truth it
[12:00] happened she she showed me one time I
[12:03] have a picture of my granny squatting
[12:04] down by the fireplace in the old home
[12:07] that she grew up in it was already a
[12:09] shackling but I took her back there and
[12:12] she as a little girl she ran outside so
[12:15] hurt her feelings were so hurt that
[12:17] nobody thought she was pretty and she
[12:20] said I knelt down by the warmth of the
[12:23] chimney she said it was I could feel the
[12:26] heat coming from the chimney and I
[12:28] prayed every day for different things
[12:30] even though she didn't really know what
[12:32] she was doing and she said I took my
[12:35] hand on my leg and I pulled the calf of
[12:38] my leg around sideways and I prayed Lord
[12:41] let my legs grow this way so that I can
[12:46] be pretty like my sisters and she prayed
[12:49] that because she wanted fat legs
[12:52] and she told me that literally about
[12:55] three weeks later she looked out at her
[12:57] legs and the calf of her leg was growing
[13:00] sideways and it scared her so bad I'm
[13:03] sure that she ran out to the to the
[13:06] chimney and prayed Lord if you will let
[13:09] my legs grow back like they were I will
[13:12] never bother you with something so
[13:15] superficial again
[13:16] and but so she had this prayer life and
[13:20] God even answered and so forth but
[13:23] uh there the family wasn't saved and
[13:26] they they cursed they talked ugly and
[13:29] there was some drinking among some of
[13:31] the family and so forth but my
[13:33] grandmother tells the story after she
[13:36] had moved to Columbus after she had
[13:39] given her heart to the Lord
[13:41] she prayed so hard for her family to be
[13:44] saved and one Christmas Eve
[13:47] she went back down to the farm and the
[13:50] whole family was gathered now you can
[13:52] imagine with all those siblings most of
[13:55] them married by now and the children
[13:58] so there must have been 30 or more
[14:00] grandchildren she said the whole house
[14:03] was full and the porch was full and the
[14:05] yard was full and she said it was really
[14:09] a lot of noise and some confusion she
[14:13] said her sister and her brother-in-law
[14:15] were fighting
[14:17] she said they had fought all day long
[14:19] disagreed and and shoved one another and
[14:22] carried on and another sister's husband
[14:25] was a Baptist preacher and he had heard
[14:29] about how my grandmother had received
[14:31] the Holy Ghost and he had all day long
[14:34] had been poking her and telling her
[14:36] there was no such thing as the Holy
[14:38] Ghost and speaking in tongues was of the
[14:40] devil and and he had poked her all day
[14:42] long and she said there it was just a a
[14:45] rough day
[14:47] and she said the food was on the table
[14:49] and people were going in and eating and
[14:52] and she said to me Steve all of a sudden
[14:55] I don't know what happened nobody was
[14:58] praying nobody was talking about the
[15:01] Lord
[15:02] she said as far as I know he had not
[15:05] been mentioned at all
[15:08] it had even been a while since my
[15:11] brother-in-law had poked at me for
[15:12] talking in tongues
[15:14] but she said all of a sudden the Holy
[15:17] Ghost fell in that big old country home
[15:20] his presence just came sweeping in it
[15:24] was Christmas Eve
[15:25] his presence just came sweeping in that
[15:28] room and people began to weep and call
[15:33] out to God
[15:35] she said her brothers or sisters her
[15:39] sister-in-laws and brother-in-laws
[15:41] fell on their faces around the sofa up
[15:45] and down the hallway and in the kitchen
[15:47] around the table chairs people were
[15:49] calling on Jesus to save them because
[15:52] the presence of the Lord had so shifted
[15:55] the room in the atmosphere nobody knew
[15:58] what to do but to call on the Lord
[16:01] she was slain out in the spirit of God
[16:04] she went out in the spirit and landed on
[16:08] her back in the living room and when she
[16:12] came to she said that's when she saw
[16:15] what had happened
[16:16] her whole family calling on the Lord and
[16:19] a prophecy was going out of her mouth
[16:21] thus says the Lord build me a church on
[16:25] Highway 10 and call it Shiloh
[16:29] and I will save people and heal people
[16:33] and I will show myself as God Almighty
[16:38] the same Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[16:40] today and forever wow she said it had
[16:43] never occurred to her to build a church
[16:46] her family had never thought of having a
[16:49] church yeah and she told me she said I
[16:53] sat up uh
[16:55] pondering what had come out of my mouth
[16:57] and my little mother Lizzy my
[17:00] great-grandmother was running through
[17:03] the house she said here come my mother
[17:06] clapping her hands now before this my
[17:11] granny would say to her mama why don't
[17:13] you pray why don't you pray and my
[17:16] great-grandmother would say honey I
[17:18] can't pray I don't have any closets in
[17:20] my house and the preacher at the
[17:23] protracted meeting said that the Bible
[17:26] said when you pray you must enter into
[17:28] the closet to pray pray and she said so
[17:31] I realized I couldn't be saved because I
[17:34] don't have a closet to pray wow
[17:38] uh all of a sudden here she come running
[17:41] through the house clapping her hands
[17:44] screaming at the top of her lungs I
[17:46] wasn't even praying and Jesus reached
[17:50] down and saved me I I wasn't even
[17:53] praying and Jesus reached down and saved
[17:56] me and my grandmother said coming right
[17:59] behind her was the Baptist preacher that
[18:03] had poked at her all day long her
[18:05] brother-in-law and said speaking in
[18:06] tongues wasn't real and he was running
[18:09] through the house screaming behind my
[18:11] grandmother great-grandmother saying
[18:13] people this is real people this is real
[18:16] I don't care what they say this is real
[18:19] this is the Holy Ghost like the book of
[18:22] Acts
[18:23] she said I got up and somebody said
[18:25] Mildred go out on the porch and she said
[18:28] I went out and opened the screen door
[18:30] and my nieces and nephews were around
[18:33] that porch praying and I watched them
[18:36] one by one as they come up speaking in
[18:39] another language had never been in a
[18:42] Pentecostal service in all their life
[18:44] so there was over 40 people filled with
[18:47] the Holy Ghost that day not even say
[18:49] this or anything no service going on
[18:52] and it changed the trajectory of my
[18:55] family you can only imagine sure
[18:57] somebody said why did that happen I
[19:00] don't know all I know is it was the
[19:03] answer to my grandmother's prayer she
[19:05] just prayed Lord I want my family saved
[19:07] I want my family to serve you and my
[19:11] great-grandmother after that she became
[19:13] a pillar in the church it was built you
[19:16] have been to the church because a few
[19:19] years ago my aunt was buried there and
[19:21] that is the church on Highway 10 that my
[19:25] grandmother built Shiloh
[19:28] my uncle you met my Uncle Jimmy my aunt
[19:32] was buried there and my cousin oh yeah I
[19:34] do remember I do well that is the church
[19:36] that's why okay my grandmother is if I
[19:38] knew that I forgot that that's why she's
[19:40] buried there that was the first church
[19:42] she built three churches that was the
[19:44] first church that she been did she build
[19:46] the one that we were in before this one
[19:47] she did so she did build that one too
[19:49] okay but uh anyway so I have so much to
[19:54] be thankful for uh while they were
[19:56] building that church they put up a brush
[19:58] Arbor which is like a tent but there
[20:01] there's no canvas on top you just put up
[20:04] you cut down brush and shrub out of the
[20:07] out of the woods and build a a frame and
[20:10] you laid that brush up on top I'm
[20:12] getting a little emotional
[20:14] because God met them there it wasn't a
[20:17] church yet it wasn't a fancy tent but it
[20:20] under the shrub under the brush Arbor
[20:23] God met my family filled them with the
[20:26] Holy Ghost
[20:27] healed the sick
[20:29] uh I I could tell you all kinds of
[20:33] stories that that I remember from
[20:35] hearing I met so many of those little
[20:38] nieces and nephews in my life later that
[20:41] had come up speaking in tongues so I
[20:43] heard their testimony as they were
[20:45] adults of that night and how God come in
[20:49] so I it's your heritage it's my Heritage
[20:52] we have so much to be thankful for I
[20:54] wanted to share that no I'm glad you did
[20:56] you just never know where God will meet
[20:57] you at I mean it could yeah I you know
[21:00] like you said it wasn't even church
[21:01] service was just house eating dinner but
[21:04] that reminds me of like Maul how God met
[21:07] Maul in the car that day yes I mean
[21:09] that's that's the same thing you didn't
[21:12] if you'd want if you want to you go out
[21:14] well I've told how my grandmother got
[21:16] saved on my daddy's side and my
[21:18] great-grandmother got saved and filled
[21:20] with the Holy Ghost on my daddy's side
[21:22] but my mother uh was and and and we lost
[21:27] her this year she was sick with
[21:28] Alzheimer's several years so we feel
[21:31] like we lost her years ago but but we
[21:34] actually buried the old house that she
[21:36] lived in just a couple months ago now
[21:39] and my mother made so many sacrifices
[21:41] for me Joshua I did tell in the last
[21:45] podcast of of some of her life and the
[21:48] beatings and some of the things she went
[21:50] through but I wanted my mother saved so
[21:53] bad uh she had been through so much and
[21:57] I hurt for her and I wanted her saved so
[22:00] bad she smoked and she drank and she
[22:04] cursed like a sailor and but she had a
[22:06] good heart you've heard people say that
[22:08] but it's true she had a good heart she
[22:11] worked at the bank but she partied hard
[22:13] and I'd say to her mother you you know I
[22:17] wish you could quit smoking because
[22:19] your clothes smell like smoke and she'd
[22:22] say Steve don't say that to me she'd say
[22:25] I know I know it's not good for me but
[22:28] you got to die with something I mean you
[22:30] know this was her attitude when she
[22:32] finally did get saved and and got
[22:34] delivered from from tobacco and all the
[22:37] things she was addicted to she said it's
[22:40] the most awful smell she'd ever smelled
[22:42] in her life yeah I remember I said she
[22:44] couldn't she couldn't stand being around
[22:45] that smell out what makes she opened her
[22:47] closet and smelled her clothes and and
[22:49] it made her sick but anyway
[22:52] um
[22:52] uh and my mother made it hard for me in
[22:55] the early days of preaching she didn't
[22:57] understand and she locked me out of the
[23:00] house at times I think I mentioned that
[23:02] maybe I think you briefly briefly did
[23:04] and uh but I loved her and I didn't I
[23:06] didn't hold it against her and the more
[23:08] she made it hard for me uh the more I
[23:12] prayed for her and uh I thought one day
[23:15] she'd come to church and walk down that
[23:17] Altar and get saved well I was pastoring
[23:21] that little Assembly of God Church that
[23:23] I told you about that I had started
[23:25] pastoring at 16 and she was living with
[23:28] me in the parsonage of the church which
[23:31] was right next to the church
[23:33] and working at the bank and so I did
[23:37] tell her I said now mother if you're
[23:39] going to live with me I want you to
[23:40] you're welcome to live with me I'm 16.
[23:44] um but I I would you're going to have to
[23:47] go to church with me on Sunday you're
[23:49] going to have to because the church
[23:50] requires that that's only right oh she
[23:53] said I don't have no problem going to
[23:55] church so I thought one of those
[23:57] Services when the Lord was moving and
[23:59] people was getting saved she'd get saved
[24:01] she didn't budge she'd smile people
[24:04] getting blessed and happy and she loved
[24:08] the people and they loved her but she
[24:09] didn't budge but one morning
[24:12] she left that parsonage and she drove
[24:15] toward the bank in Downtown Columbus
[24:18] Georgia she crossed the old Dillingham
[24:20] Street bridge that I got you to drive me
[24:23] across last night when we came back from
[24:25] dinner celebrating my birthday I thought
[24:28] about it as we're crossing the bridge
[24:30] and mama said something came in the in
[24:34] the car and she knew she was lost and
[24:38] she had to do something about it and we
[24:41] know what that something was it was the
[24:43] spirit of the Lord it was the spirit of
[24:45] conviction and we need that to pull us
[24:49] to Christ
[24:51] and she said all of a sudden she began
[24:54] to weep
[24:55] she was smoking a cigarette at the time
[24:58] and and she said she rolled down the
[25:00] window I guess she was a litter bug she
[25:03] rolled down the window and she threw
[25:05] that cigarette out the window into the
[25:08] river
[25:09] uh over the bridge and she said Lord
[25:12] Jesus if you'll save me
[25:15] and deliver me I'll Never Smoke another
[25:18] one and that was that
[25:21] she never smoked another one
[25:24] she gave her heart to the Lord that was
[25:26] her salvation experience
[25:28] sometimes later I baptized her in the
[25:31] name of the Lord Jesus Christ she
[25:33] received the Holy Ghost
[25:35] and she loved the world I won't go too
[25:38] far into this on the podcast or so many
[25:41] different kinds of people will see this
[25:44] but she loved the world and she loved to
[25:46] look like the world
[25:48] and God had to deal with her heart that
[25:51] modesty is important for Christian women
[25:54] God had to deal with her because she was
[25:56] used to showing everything
[25:58] and God had to deal with her about
[26:00] covering up and and being modest and uh
[26:04] getting rid of some of the things that
[26:05] that she like to decorate with like the
[26:08] world does but he changed her life and
[26:11] well Joshua that's one of the best
[26:13] things the Lord ever did for me was to
[26:15] save my mama
[26:17] and I was so thankful very very very
[26:20] thankful that she gave her heart to the
[26:22] Lord and that it happened you know it's
[26:25] not the same as my great-grandmother's
[26:27] experience there but but it's
[26:29] supernatural to me and it just showed
[26:31] you I mean God will meet you wherever
[26:33] wherever you are he will if you'll just
[26:35] call on him you don't have to be in
[26:36] church you don't have to be dressed up
[26:38] you just have to have a sincere heart
[26:41] and say Lord Jesus Come into my life and
[26:45] forgive my sins I want to be saved and I
[26:47] want to serve you I want everybody to
[26:50] understand that we don't just get our
[26:52] sins forgiven so we can go on and live a
[26:54] rotten life
[26:56] we ask him to forgive us and Deliver Us
[27:00] and sever us from those things so that
[27:03] we can live a righteous life a holy life
[27:06] a clean life we could never live it holy
[27:09] enough or clean enough it's his
[27:10] righteousness that covers us but we have
[27:13] to make every effort to serve the Lord
[27:16] to pray to read our Bible to help others
[27:20] get to to that place of Salvation so
[27:23] it's a life of service uh this is a
[27:25] little bit off topic but it was on I was
[27:28] thinking about earlier do you have a
[27:30] you've traveled all over the world
[27:31] ministering
[27:33] and we're going to get back to your life
[27:35] story by doing access before I forget it
[27:36] you've traveled all over the world do
[27:38] you have a favorite place where you
[27:40] preach at
[27:41] uh
[27:44] cause it's beautiful or because of the
[27:45] people I mean or both well I love Africa
[27:50] that's what I figured that was going to
[27:51] be one of Africa and um I have been in
[27:55] many countries in Africa uh but but if I
[27:59] had a couple that would would be very
[28:01] dear to me it would be Ghana and Kenya
[28:04] for sure these are countries that I've
[28:07] had on my heart for for over 25 years
[28:10] over 25 years before I was married
[28:13] and I have been blessed uh the the
[28:15] people in in Ghana are so sincere and
[28:19] they love the Lord they worship with all
[28:21] they have and and I feel like they're my
[28:24] family and then in Kenya you've got to
[28:26] experience uh my family there and today
[28:30] is also it is Pastor Peterson guandero's
[28:34] birthday it is happy birthday happy
[28:36] birthday to him he's a few years older
[28:39] than I am I don't remember how many but
[28:41] a few years older than I am and we share
[28:44] a birthday and he has been a particular
[28:46] blessing in my life and his family his
[28:49] twin sons have been a special uh part of
[28:53] my life but uh God's people everywhere
[28:58] will will get in your heart I've been
[29:01] all over Canada I've been all over
[29:03] Europe and preaching and and Poland and
[29:07] uh the United Kingdom so many places
[29:11] Ireland and Scotland and then uh
[29:15] Iceland is is if if I had to say the
[29:18] third place it's it's Iceland and it's
[29:20] not because there are big crowds there
[29:22] of Believers but they're just some of
[29:24] the most precious people in all the
[29:26] world so that that's a good question and
[29:28] and without Iceland and stuff I mean we
[29:30] wouldn't be able to stream the studio
[29:32] really wouldn't be because God opened
[29:35] the door yeah and that's a story for
[29:37] another podcast sometime uh after you've
[29:40] had some other guests say when we get
[29:42] Hawk on here to talk about it let's tell
[29:44] some of it but but how how God connected
[29:47] me with with the station in Iceland and
[29:49] brother Erickson to me is Supernatural
[29:53] it's miraculous and I want to say one
[29:55] other thing
[29:56] um I had a lot of people ask me about
[29:58] the right division book yes and I just
[30:01] want to get this out here so they can
[30:03] hear it you are in the middle of
[30:04] rewriting it we are almost finished
[30:07] rewriting it and when I say rewriting it
[30:10] I mean just updating the language yes
[30:12] just a little bit uh I don't know that
[30:14] we're gonna add to the story itself but
[30:17] we're just updating the language a
[30:19] little bit because it was initially
[30:21] taken from audio recordings
[30:24] um I I have the old uh edition of write
[30:29] the vision and if someone just could not
[30:32] wait I did not want to wait I can send
[30:35] them a uh a computer file a digital file
[30:39] of the original we don't have but maybe
[30:41] a handful of the books anymore that I
[30:44] had so many people text me and ask me
[30:45] about it so I didn't want to I wanted to
[30:47] say that before I forgot about that we
[30:49] will have that and we'll make that
[30:50] available on our website and on our app
[30:53] as soon as and we're going to print it
[30:55] because I think a lot of people would be
[30:57] interested to read that we're going to
[30:59] print it and it tell it goes into a
[31:00] little more detail about the life story
[31:03] but yeah that's a good point because I
[31:05] also had a lot of people asking yeah I
[31:07] mean the next day everybody was asking
[31:09] well what's the book who wrote it where
[31:11] can I get it I'm like he's in the middle
[31:13] of rewriting it and redoing it so it
[31:16] should be out hopefully soon I have
[31:18] another book that uh hopefully a couple
[31:20] couple more that will come out and one
[31:23] is a book that will tell uh many of my
[31:28] experiences my dreams and my visions
[31:31] that God has given me through the years
[31:33] Supernatural experiences uh it is called
[31:36] my eyes have seen the glory and uh it it
[31:40] had it's actually we actually have a
[31:43] prototype of it printed already uh I
[31:46] believe it's going to be a blessing to
[31:48] people but I'm sort of in the process of
[31:51] of making sure that we've put put what
[31:53] needs to be in and it you know there's
[31:55] been so many experiences we're just
[31:58] trying to make sure it's hard to get
[31:59] them all in but you can watch for that
[32:00] too my eyes have seen the glory and then
[32:03] I have a third book that's coming called
[32:05] possessing Bridal inheritance and uh I
[32:09] I'm having a hard time turning loose of
[32:11] these books they're they're they're so
[32:14] almost done you've been working on them
[32:15] for a while for years yeah I remember
[32:17] when we used to go down to the beaches
[32:19] to work that's when you worked on down
[32:21] there um
[32:22] back to your life story we we ended the
[32:26] last podcast kind of talking about how
[32:28] you how you came into the message and
[32:30] how you found the message
[32:31] and through Brother Cleveland in the
[32:33] tapes
[32:35] I want to go
[32:38] I want to say this
[32:39] you had already talked to your big mama
[32:43] about how you thought there was
[32:45] something else yes and y'all were going
[32:46] around to tent meeting to tempt me and
[32:48] she went around she went along with you
[32:49] she did
[32:50] and you not knowing that she already
[32:53] knew who brother Brandon was correct yes
[32:55] and so when you left North Carolina she
[32:57] was already sick back in Georgia correct
[33:00] that's correct you went back and you
[33:01] were going to tell her about brother
[33:03] Branham that's right I wanted you to
[33:05] tell him I didn't tell that no no I
[33:07] don't think we had gotten that far
[33:08] because I went back to hear the end just
[33:10] to make sure because it's a good story
[33:13] and I want to know like I will I'll let
[33:16] you tell a story and then I'll I'll ask
[33:18] you some of that stuff I think I did
[33:19] mention about being in Anderson South
[33:22] Carolina and brother Gerald clean you
[33:24] did yes and sister Delane bringing me
[33:26] the the paper bag of brother Brandon and
[33:29] how you didn't listen to him for a long
[33:31] time listen to him and then uh things
[33:33] started going downhill and I was weeping
[33:37] one day and praying and the Lord said
[33:39] the answer to your problem is in that
[33:41] bag and I took it down and began to
[33:43] listen and I listened that day to uh all
[33:46] of the tapes I think it was six
[33:48] cassettes all together because he
[33:50] preached this Sunday morning and Sunday
[33:52] night the spoken word is the original
[33:53] scene then I got the warning from my
[33:56] Deacon you know you might better stay
[33:57] away from that uh there's kind of a cult
[34:01] that follows that Ministry and so forth
[34:04] and Etc but it was too late
[34:07] once I heard the tape it was too late I
[34:10] heard the sermon but once I heard the
[34:12] sermon I knew that that brother Branham
[34:16] was carrying uh the the the spirit and
[34:20] power of Elijah and that's what you had
[34:22] been looking at that's what God had
[34:24] spoken to me as a young boy the spirit
[34:27] and power of Elijah would forerun the
[34:29] second coming of Jesus Christ he spoke
[34:32] that to my heart and I preached it and
[34:35] my granny warned me remember she said
[34:37] you better be careful people will think
[34:39] that you're preaching about you which
[34:41] nothing was farther from my mind because
[34:43] we were going to tent meetings trying to
[34:46] find someone who was operating in that
[34:49] courage in that power uh and in that
[34:53] prophetic ocean that Elijah operated in
[34:56] but I knew the minute I heard that voice
[34:59] as soon as I heard in fact I told you
[35:02] this I think
[35:04] um I ran over for lunch my mother was
[35:07] off from the bank that day and uh was
[35:10] cooking lunch she was frying okra on the
[35:13] stove and I ran in and spun her around
[35:16] hugged her and spun her around and I
[35:18] began to try to tell her I didn't have
[35:20] the right words and I said Mama I have
[35:23] heard the voice of God speaking to me
[35:26] through a man's voice
[35:28] and I wasn't saying in any way then or
[35:31] now that brother Branham was a god
[35:33] no he was a mouthpiece for God in my
[35:38] life and I believe in his generation
[35:41] sure
[35:43] when I began to hear that I you know
[35:46] over a period of months I listened to uh
[35:50] every tape I could get my hands on and
[35:52] they were long sermons and some of them
[35:55] hard to follow
[35:57] uh they they went against so many things
[36:00] that I had been taught uh theologically
[36:04] and let me just give you one example and
[36:07] that is in the Holiness Church if if I
[36:11] called my granny and she wasn't there I
[36:13] would have this thought I've missed the
[36:15] Rapture or or if I was going along and
[36:18] said a little something I shouldn't say
[36:20] or did a little something I shouldn't do
[36:22] I thought I was lost and so the church I
[36:25] grew up in had no understanding
[36:28] whatsoever of the security of the
[36:31] believer and that uh that God saw us in
[36:36] his foreknowledge he knew us and he saw
[36:39] us before the foundation of the world
[36:41] and it's not that we don't have a choice
[36:43] we have free will but his foreknowledge
[36:47] in his foreknowledge he saw my choice
[36:50] before I ever made it and the Bible says
[36:53] I've got the scripture here that we were
[36:56] predestinated to be conformed to the
[36:59] image of his son and I I that when when
[37:04] I began to hear brother Brandon preach
[37:06] about the security of the believer and
[37:08] that there was a place that you could
[37:11] know
[37:12] that you were saved you could know that
[37:15] you were not going to be lost when I
[37:18] began to hear him teach that salvation
[37:20] is not something that you get and lose
[37:23] and get and lose and get and lose now I
[37:25] want to make sure that I'm clear
[37:28] I don't believe that that salvation is a
[37:32] license to sin or that Grace gives you a
[37:36] right to go out and and do things that
[37:39] you shouldn't do but what I'm saying is
[37:41] once you belong to God
[37:43] once you truly belong to Jesus Christ
[37:46] and you are now filled with his Zoe
[37:50] eternal life
[37:51] if if you stray if you go away if you do
[37:55] something you shouldn't do I begin to
[37:57] understand from Brother branham's
[37:59] preaching he will woo you God will chase
[38:03] you now
[38:04] he will chase you down he will pursue
[38:08] you because you're his yeah there's no
[38:11] running away and it's not that he would
[38:13] ever say I'm done with you yeah you see
[38:16] I have this understanding today that God
[38:19] will never be done with me he'll never
[38:22] be finished with me I'm I'm a part of
[38:25] him
[38:26] and I didn't have that in Pentecost we
[38:29] thought everything was sin they taught
[38:31] me that everything and nobody agreed and
[38:34] I heard things like women had to wear
[38:36] hats to church or women couldn't wear
[38:38] hats to church or caffeine was sin and
[38:41] some people would say you can't drink a
[38:43] Coca-Cola but they would eat a whole
[38:45] chocolate cake we would have a lot of
[38:47] centers in our church
[38:49] well I I would be wrong because I drink
[38:52] coffee every day one cup every day at
[38:55] least but but in those days nobody
[38:57] wanted to be wrong and they were really
[39:00] preaching things like that which kept
[39:02] people in total confusion yeah total
[39:05] confusion and so when I began to Feast
[39:08] on the message of the hour uh what
[39:10] brother Branham was given by God to
[39:13] preach uh to fulfill scripture scripture
[39:17] was actually fulfilled in his ministry
[39:19] because as John the Baptist was sent to
[39:22] forerun the first coming I believe the
[39:25] message that was given to brother
[39:27] Branham was set to forerun the second
[39:29] coming of Jesus Christ so that a bride
[39:32] could be prepared and ready to meet the
[39:34] Lord and I don't I don't uh I I don't
[39:38] mince words with that I I I want to say
[39:41] that very clearly that I am fully
[39:45] persuaded that the message that he
[39:48] preached is a message sent from God to
[39:52] prepare a people for the Rapture and I'm
[39:55] one of those so it wasn't that I was so
[39:59] wrong and so lost in the in the in the
[40:02] other churches it was God leading me and
[40:05] he will lead you folks if you'll let him
[40:07] he'll lead you uh and and you don't
[40:10] despise where you've come from and
[40:12] criticize churches that you've come out
[40:14] of you just accept the fact that God's
[40:17] leading you to deeper and deeper truth
[40:19] and that's what he did now the first
[40:22] thing I wanted to do was tell everybody
[40:25] and I thought that everybody would be
[40:27] excited about Jesus name baptism
[40:30] I thought everybody would be excited
[40:32] when I could explain to them from the
[40:35] word that there are not three Gods God
[40:38] the Father God the son and God the Holy
[40:40] Ghost as though they're separate Gods
[40:42] but it's one eternal spirit God one
[40:45] eternal spirit operating in three
[40:48] distinct offices Jehovah of the Old
[40:51] Testament is Jesus of the New Testament
[40:54] Same Spirit same God I thought everybody
[40:56] would be thrilled
[40:58] I thought everybody would be thrilled
[41:00] when I could show them that the Bible
[41:02] said do everything you do in the name of
[41:05] Jesus Christ and when I would invite
[41:07] people to come and be baptized in the
[41:09] name of the Lord Jesus Christ I thought
[41:11] everybody would be interested in that
[41:13] because we could prove it by the Bible
[41:14] but I found out very quickly that when
[41:18] you start touching people's Traditions
[41:20] yeah and when you start touching what
[41:22] people have always been taught what mama
[41:24] taught him and Granny taught him and
[41:26] grandpa taught us stir up you will stir
[41:29] up some devils just to be honest with
[41:31] you so I didn't know how things were
[41:33] going to go when I drove when I got in
[41:36] my automobile my grandmother was already
[41:38] sick
[41:39] uh she had had a terrible car accident
[41:42] and uh while they were taking care of
[41:47] her in the hospital in Montgomery she
[41:49] was coming back from a Revival that I
[41:51] was running in Alabama near the
[41:53] Mississippi line she had this terrible
[41:55] accident
[41:56] and while they were taken care of her in
[41:59] the hospital they x-rayed her lungs and
[42:01] found out that she had lung cancer it
[42:03] had started in the female organs and had
[42:06] spread to the lungs and uh her days were
[42:09] very very numbered but God miraculous
[42:12] miraculously gave us a couple of years
[42:14] with her when when it was said
[42:17] originally months maybe weeks wow
[42:20] um
[42:21] so she was uh she was probably at that
[42:25] time still doing some income tax
[42:26] actually because that's what she did
[42:28] when she was able that's what she loved
[42:31] doing was helping people with that but I
[42:34] didn't know how she was going to receive
[42:35] it but I knew that I had to get in my
[42:37] automobile and drive four hours
[42:40] to to tell my granny that I had found
[42:43] the ministry that had operated in the in
[42:47] the spirit and the power when I first
[42:50] recognized that I called Brother
[42:52] Cleveland and I said I want to go
[42:53] tomorrow
[42:54] I want us to go and hear Brother bran
[42:57] and where will he be where can I hear
[42:59] more I want to go where he is if I could
[43:03] shake his hand I'd be thrilled but I
[43:06] want to hear more and and brother
[43:08] Cleveland just chuckled a little bit he
[43:10] said brother Shelley brother Branham
[43:12] died in 1965 well that was three years
[43:15] before I was born I was bummed I want
[43:18] you to know I remember the feeling that
[43:20] struck me I was bummed
[43:22] so I'm on my way to tell Granny and I
[43:26] prayed all the way Lord Jesus prepare
[43:28] her heart prepare her heart
[43:31] and I got here and we had some good
[43:34] fellowship and I don't remember exactly
[43:36] how the morning went but but I said big
[43:38] mama I want to talk to you I said you
[43:40] remember
[43:42] how we went around to all those tent
[43:44] meetings and we we went to find someone
[43:47] who was operating in that spirit and
[43:49] power of Elijah and I said you remember
[43:51] how disappointed we were she said oh yes
[43:54] I remember she said I remember the night
[43:57] that you you got up and sat in
[43:59] somebody's chair
[44:00] there was a preacher who was telling
[44:02] people that night the tent was packed
[44:04] out and he said uh I am the Elijah to
[44:08] come if I'm not going to call his name
[44:10] but if I did many people would know the
[44:12] name
[44:13] uh I am the Elijah to come and and he
[44:18] said if anybody sits in this chair this
[44:20] is the the chair that God has anointed
[44:22] for for the Elijah prophet and my mouth
[44:25] is just hung up if anybody sits in this
[44:27] chair God's going to strike them dead
[44:28] tonight to vindicate who I am and I I'm
[44:32] told my granny I'm going down there this
[44:34] man is not an Elijah Prophet he's a
[44:37] false prophet and I'm going to sit in
[44:39] that chair well she went crazy you know
[44:41] tried to stop me but it was too late I
[44:43] was already halfway down the aisle and I
[44:45] sat in the chair and swung my legs back
[44:48] and forth as a young man to show him
[44:51] that he was wrong and and of course he
[44:55] covered up by falling down on one new
[44:57] knee and praying Mercy for me that I
[45:00] wouldn't be slain but God I knew in my
[45:03] heart that was just phony baloney and I
[45:06] told granny it reminded her how
[45:07] disappointed we were uh with that kind
[45:10] of stuff and she said yes I remember and
[45:13] I said but Graham me I have found the
[45:16] man I have found the ministry that I
[45:19] believe came in that same spirit and
[45:23] power of Elijah
[45:25] and she said oh you have and I said yes
[45:29] ma'am she said his name wouldn't happen
[45:33] to be William Branham would it
[45:36] well I was just shocked I was just
[45:38] totally Blown Away
[45:40] I said yes ma'am as a matter of fact it
[45:43] was
[45:44] but I had not heard the name yeah
[45:47] and so had she gone to she said okay she
[45:52] said uh I said why have you never
[45:55] mentioned it to me and she said I'll
[45:57] tell you she said but I won't tell you
[45:59] until you do me a favor I said what is
[46:02] the favor she said I want you to go and
[46:05] climb up the Attic
[46:06] in the attic and it was a pull down
[46:10] ladder and I want you to go up and
[46:12] there's a there was a bed up there
[46:13] because one of the one of her children
[46:15] actually stepped in the attic for a
[46:17] period of time uh and and near the
[46:20] headboard is a big uh cardboard box
[46:23] sealed up on the top and she said you'll
[46:26] recognize it and you bring it down here
[46:28] to me and we'll open it and then I'll
[46:30] answer your question so I did I went up
[46:31] the ladder got the box dusted off the
[46:34] top come down open it up and it was full
[46:37] of spoken word books books brother
[46:40] Branham sermons
[46:42] and even the original
[46:45] single uh seal sermons that he preached
[46:50] on the seals before they bound it into
[46:52] one big book
[46:54] and
[46:55] do you fear cancer as an eagle stirth
[46:58] her nest
[46:59] uh lots of the tracks that were
[47:02] distributed in the Branham campaigns
[47:05] and I said big mama why did you have all
[47:09] this and why is it all sealed up in the
[47:11] attic and why did you never tell me and
[47:14] she teared up
[47:16] and she leaned up in in her recliner and
[47:19] she said honey I was scared
[47:22] I said you know I wasn't used to that
[47:25] side of my granny she was no there's a
[47:27] lion
[47:28] and I said big mama what do you mean
[47:31] scared and she said I went
[47:34] and she told me the whole story and she
[47:37] said brother Branham was in Birmingham
[47:40] Alabama and I think that was 64.
[47:44] 1964. and she said I wanted to go so bad
[47:48] and she said but the denomination that
[47:52] she was in was looking down on that it
[47:55] was Assemblies of God and they were
[47:57] looking down on brother Branham because
[47:58] he wasn't one of their preachers
[48:01] and so she said there was a lot of
[48:03] discouragement you know of going no no
[48:06] encouragement but she said I was going
[48:09] to go but I didn't want to drive by
[48:10] myself and she said I could take off
[48:12] work and go but but I didn't want to go
[48:14] by myself I couldn't find anybody and
[48:17] she said I finally found sister Minnie
[48:19] Jackson
[48:20] and sister Jackson was a precious Old
[48:23] Saint little tiny sister that lived here
[48:26] in Columbus old Holiness Pentecostal
[48:29] woman and she was so skinny I'm telling
[48:32] you that you could see her bones through
[48:33] her through her clothes she was a skinny
[48:36] little sister
[48:37] and she was uh you know she was an older
[48:41] lady already and she was said I'll go I
[48:45] know they don't want but I'll go
[48:47] so they went up to the meeting and got
[48:50] there early and stood in line for hours
[48:52] to get in to get a seat
[48:55] and she was so blessed she was so
[48:58] blessed by the sermon and they had
[49:00] gotten a motel and they were going to
[49:02] stay the next day
[49:04] and after the service sister Jackson
[49:06] said sister Shelley I'm so homesick I
[49:09] can't hardly stand it she wasn't
[49:11] critical of the meeting she loved the
[49:13] meeting but she said I can't I want to
[49:15] go home
[49:16] and my grammy said but sister Jackson
[49:18] it's over four hours to take you home
[49:21] and she said but I can't stay here
[49:23] you've got to take me home
[49:25] and my granny said I was in a real uh
[49:28] predicament but she said I wanted to
[49:30] honor her and so she said we got in the
[49:32] car
[49:33] and went to the motel got sister
[49:36] Jackson's things and we took I took her
[49:39] straight home
[49:40] and she said uh I stopped in at the
[49:43] house
[49:44] and walk your granddaddy up I didn't
[49:47] want him to to know or hear that I had
[49:49] been in Columbus in the middle of the
[49:50] night and didn't tell him or run into
[49:52] brother Jackson and him say something
[49:54] and upset your granddaddy so she said I
[49:56] woke him up and said to him Ralph I I
[50:00] brought sister Jackson home she wasn't
[50:01] feeling good and I want to go back to
[50:04] the meeting and he said well you've
[50:05] already got off you might as well go
[50:06] back she said I got right in my car
[50:08] drove all the way back to the motel
[50:11] four hours
[50:13] because I wanted to be there the next
[50:15] night and I think it was that night I
[50:17] think it was the second not not night
[50:19] not the first night that brother Branham
[50:22] preached this sermon and she said he it
[50:25] scared me because she said he was saying
[50:27] something like God changed Abraham
[50:30] Abram's name to Abraham
[50:33] and it was a
[50:36] b-r-a-h-a-m-7 letters and she said I
[50:39] don't think he said it but I'm sitting
[50:41] here and I go
[50:43] b-r-a-n-h-a-m seven letters and she said
[50:47] um
[50:48] that seems strange she said then he told
[50:51] the story about how the The Travelers
[50:54] came there to the tent of Abram and
[50:56] Sarah and began to tell them what God
[50:59] was going to do for them and remember
[51:00] Sarah laughed and one of those one of
[51:04] those visitors knew that she was
[51:05] laughing even though he didn't hear he
[51:07] spiritually discerned that she was
[51:09] behind the tent They're laughing and and
[51:11] so he was explaining that and then she
[51:15] said he turned his back at the end of
[51:19] the service
[51:20] and he went all the way down the row
[51:23] with his back turned to the audience and
[51:25] he said I'm doing this because they say
[51:28] that I'm somehow reading the people with
[51:30] some kind of mental telepathy or
[51:32] something but the gift of discerning of
[51:34] spirits and discernment was so strong in
[51:37] his life that he would go down the line
[51:39] tell people their first name last name
[51:41] address doctor's name ailment sometimes
[51:45] a letter or something that was in their
[51:47] purse I mean it was so accurate and my
[51:51] granny was a her mouth just dropped open
[51:53] she was sitting close enough to the road
[51:55] that he chose that she could hear the
[51:58] people gasping and saying that's right
[52:01] that's right that's right that's right
[52:02] so it's back his turn and a whole row of
[52:05] people are being ministered to and he's
[52:06] telling them their name and he's reading
[52:09] it by the spirit off their mailbox
[52:12] 473
[52:16] you know something Lane
[52:19] and it's so
[52:22] she had seen gifts before but nothing
[52:25] that profound and it scared her and she
[52:28] said I didn't understand it
[52:30] and I didn't want to speak one word
[52:33] against it because I knew it was holy
[52:36] and I knew it was God
[52:39] so I got the material but when I got
[52:42] home I boxed it up and I put it up there
[52:45] because she said I felt like at some
[52:48] point in my life I would know more about
[52:51] it yeah and she said I didn't speak of
[52:53] it
[52:54] she said maybe a few people right after
[52:56] it happened but I didn't speak of it so
[52:58] she said that's how you were born and
[53:00] you came along and we spent so many
[53:02] hours in church together and I never
[53:04] told you about it
[53:05] and and I said to her I I said some very
[53:09] personal things to her
[53:11] uh because of being a woman pastor and I
[53:16] don't want to go too deep into that but
[53:18] I just told her I said you know if if
[53:21] this ministry is is a promised Ministry
[53:25] and what God is doing is that is to help
[53:28] prepare a bride well we're going to have
[53:30] to line up with the word he preaches
[53:33] and she said that's right and I had
[53:36] talked with her before about about
[53:39] holding the authority of a woman pastor
[53:42] and I don't want to offend anybody but I
[53:45] just know what the scripture said and
[53:47] she had argued with me every time
[53:49] but in that moment
[53:51] she she she hung her head and she said I
[53:55] have I have labored all these years in
[53:58] that position and it wasn't even my
[54:00] responsibility and I said yes ma'am
[54:03] that's right you were doing God a
[54:04] service without being in the center of
[54:07] his will and that was it yeah
[54:09] he stepped down
[54:11] when when she when you found out that
[54:14] she knew all along who brother Brandon
[54:16] was
[54:17] what was were you mad that she didn't
[54:19] tell you almost mad but I understood
[54:21] after she told the story yeah
[54:24] and I would rather her have kept that
[54:26] from me look God has a timing for it
[54:28] that's what I say I mean you got to
[54:30] trust God's timing and maybe you know
[54:32] because some people get get off balance
[54:35] when they find a ministry as powerful as
[54:37] brother Branham there have been so many
[54:39] who have gone off balance who have
[54:42] become cultish who have lifted up a man
[54:45] instead of the word I have precious
[54:48] friends and acquaintances all over the
[54:51] world that have gone way too far that
[54:54] have emphasized a man hang his pictures
[54:57] everywhere in their churches and have
[55:01] made him uh really it would be so
[55:04] embarrassing to him because he was so
[55:07] humble his ministry was so humble and
[55:10] and my focus is not on brother Branham
[55:14] my focus is on the Lord Jesus Christ but
[55:17] I truly feel like God used William
[55:19] Branham his ministry to introduce me to
[55:23] really introduced me to the revelation
[55:25] of who Jesus really is yeah so I honor
[55:28] him and I respect him I do not believe
[55:30] he was infallible I believe he was a man
[55:33] and I believe that he made mistakes but
[55:36] I believe that when he spoke thus saith
[55:38] the Lord it was the saith the Lord and I
[55:42] believe that there's a lot that that
[55:44] anyone could learn from a Ministry like
[55:47] that it'll wreck your life it'll change
[55:49] your life yeah but we as the bride we go
[55:52] on WE march on we take the truth that
[55:55] has been restored through Luther and
[55:58] Wesley and brother Branham and we go on
[56:01] we don't we don't stop we keep moving uh
[56:05] toward what God has for us in our day
[56:08] and that is that a holy generation of
[56:12] people would be raised up with Bridal
[56:16] inheritance as the sons of God as the
[56:19] Bride of Jesus Christ to to cast out
[56:22] devils and to heal the sick and to raise
[56:24] the dead this is our it's our
[56:28] inheritance and uh but for me God really
[56:32] used the ministry of brother Branham to
[56:34] help me get there and my grandmother was
[56:36] thrilled you know I was able then to
[56:38] share materials with her and watch what
[56:41] few video clips we have and listen to
[56:45] sermon after sermon after sermon so the
[56:47] last few months of her life uh
[56:52] 12 to 18 months of her life were filled
[56:55] with feasting on the word and she she uh
[56:59] let me tell this because she being
[57:02] Assembly of God she always had baptized
[57:05] in the titles like a lot of
[57:07] denominational churches I baptize you in
[57:09] the name of the father and of the son
[57:11] and of the Holy Ghost which none of that
[57:13] is a name those are titles father is not
[57:16] a name son is not a name even Holy Ghost
[57:19] is not a name
[57:21] but without a revelation that's all you
[57:23] know to do and that's what we all did
[57:25] until we had a revelation but the Bible
[57:28] said the father hath chosen him and
[57:30] highly exalted him and given him a name
[57:32] that is above every name that at the
[57:34] name of Jesus every knee shall bow and
[57:38] every tongue shall confess the Bible
[57:40] also says do all that you do in the name
[57:43] of Jesus Christ and then Peter quickly
[57:45] in Acts 2 38 repent he said and be
[57:49] baptized now who was Peter Peter is the
[57:52] one that Jesus asked whom do men say
[57:55] that I the son of man am and he said
[57:57] well people say you are John the Baptist
[58:00] come back from the dead or Elijah the
[58:02] Prophet come back from the dead and he
[58:04] said who do you say I am Peter said Thou
[58:07] Art the Christ the Messiah the Son of
[58:10] the Living God and Jesus turned to Peter
[58:13] and said Thou Art Peter and Upon This
[58:17] Rock not Peter the Revelation Upon This
[58:21] Rock I will build my church and the
[58:23] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[58:25] it this same Peter who received a
[58:28] revelation of who Jesus is is the one
[58:30] who said repent and be baptized in the
[58:32] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[58:34] of your sins but my grandmother had
[58:36] never done that so she said this to me
[58:38] Joshua she said will you take me to the
[58:42] to the old church this was several
[58:43] months now after I had had witnessed to
[58:46] her and was uh given her the tapes and
[58:48] she was so blessed and so happy
[58:51] she was already on some oxygen at this
[58:53] time but I came home on a weekend and
[58:56] and to visit her knowing that my days
[58:58] with her were numbered and she said uh
[59:01] will you take me to the to the church
[59:03] honey she said the van is out here she
[59:06] just bought a church van and she said
[59:09] I'd like for you to take me in the van
[59:11] and she had just paved the parking lot
[59:13] with concrete and she said I'd like to
[59:16] see the parking lot and I'd like to go
[59:18] visit the church and just see it I don't
[59:20] know if I'll be able to go to church
[59:21] Sunday or not I said sure Big Mama I'll
[59:23] be glad to do it so I help her out we
[59:26] get to the church uh I I stopped to do
[59:29] something I don't remember and I hear
[59:31] water running in the baptistry
[59:34] and I and I thought to myself well she
[59:36] wants me to clean out the baptistry
[59:38] because I'd not push baptism on her
[59:41] uh I just had witnessed
[59:44] and iron water ran the Baptist I thought
[59:46] well she wants me to clean out the
[59:48] baptistry why didn't she just tell me
[59:50] the baptistry needs to be wiped down and
[59:52] cleaned and I don't have nobody else to
[59:54] do it I said I would have wore different
[59:56] clothes
[59:57] and I walk on through the church
[59:58] mumbling to myself why she didn't tell
[1:00:01] me and I get around there and I said big
[1:00:03] mama what's going on she said I'm
[1:00:04] running water in the hot water in the
[1:00:06] baptistry she said it's almost full
[1:00:09] and and I said well why didn't you tell
[1:00:11] me that you wanted me to clean out the
[1:00:13] baptistry because I would have wore
[1:00:15] different clothes but I said it don't
[1:00:17] matter I can replace these you know that
[1:00:19] kind of thing she said
[1:00:21] what
[1:00:22] and I went through it again she said I
[1:00:24] don't want you to clean out the
[1:00:25] baptistry I want you to baptize me in
[1:00:28] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:31] so God had given her that Revelation so
[1:00:35] I have the privilege when were you
[1:00:37] baptized I was originally baptized in in
[1:00:41] school uh I I heard about this baptism
[1:00:45] and and I I actually uh had had a
[1:00:49] baptism but but didn't understand it
[1:00:52] didn't really know what I was doing so
[1:00:54] when I heard the the message truth and
[1:00:57] began to preach what God was revealing
[1:00:59] to me
[1:01:01] I was in Galax Virginia preaching for
[1:01:05] Brother Kyle Kinser and his son brother
[1:01:09] Sammy was he knew what I believed but I
[1:01:13] had never really after coming to the
[1:01:15] truth I had never had a baptism in the
[1:01:18] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:01:20] and he knew that and they were having a
[1:01:23] picnic on the New River at that day and
[1:01:26] I said brother I would it would it
[1:01:28] confuse your people if they found out
[1:01:30] that that I had a baptism in Jesus name
[1:01:33] many years ago but didn't understand it
[1:01:34] and I got you to re-baptize me and I
[1:01:37] hear I have been preaching to me and he
[1:01:38] said oh no it won't confuse them and so
[1:01:41] they took me out in that chilly cold New
[1:01:44] River and baptized me in the name of the
[1:01:46] Lord Jesus Christ and that would have
[1:01:48] been about
[1:01:50] 89 about 1989 I would guess that would
[1:01:55] be my best guess long time ago I'm sure
[1:01:58] it did a long time ago and I have
[1:02:00] baptized several thousand people since
[1:02:03] 1989 including in Israel I've baptized
[1:02:07] people in the Jordan River in the name
[1:02:09] of the Lord Jesus the dead seat and not
[1:02:11] I've never baptized it by the Dead Sea
[1:02:13] no but I baptized in the Jordan River
[1:02:16] and in the Sea of Galilee that's right
[1:02:18] that's right Sea of Galilee we baptize
[1:02:20] some there I baptize in fact I in
[1:02:23] Jerusalem or in Israel I've baptized
[1:02:26] people from over 40 nations in in the
[1:02:29] Jordan River uh Taiwanese even mainland
[1:02:33] China uh I've baptized Believers after
[1:02:37] introducing to them the Oneness of God
[1:02:41] and the baptism in the name of Jesus I
[1:02:44] have and you know I believe it's the
[1:02:47] right way I don't understand it son that
[1:02:50] that people have such a problem wearing
[1:02:52] the name of Jesus I don't even fully
[1:02:55] understand why Satan hates that so much
[1:02:57] but but I have a friend who's just been
[1:03:00] walking through a trial because the Lord
[1:03:02] has revealed that to him and he wants it
[1:03:06] done right and it's it's hard where he
[1:03:10] is to find someone that will do it
[1:03:13] because they they feel like well Jesus
[1:03:15] said in the name of the father and of
[1:03:18] the Son and the Holy Ghost but see Peter
[1:03:21] had a revelation of what the name was
[1:03:23] and you and I have a revelation it's not
[1:03:26] titles anymore it's the name of the Lord
[1:03:29] Jesus and he knows it's the right way he
[1:03:31] knows it's the right way but he's
[1:03:32] finding it hard and and it's confusing
[1:03:34] to people and then there are those who
[1:03:36] go around saying well it doesn't matter
[1:03:38] what they say over you whoa whoa whoa
[1:03:40] whoa then why is it in the Bible exactly
[1:03:43] if it doesn't matter no say well it
[1:03:45] doesn't matter what they say over you it
[1:03:47] says what's in your heart but don't you
[1:03:49] want to do it the Bible Way don't you
[1:03:51] want to do it the scriptural way I do
[1:03:54] yeah I did
[1:03:55] yeah
[1:03:57] um so when did you move back we're gonna
[1:04:00] we're gonna finish up your life story
[1:04:02] and about what we're going to talk about
[1:04:04] I guess when we moved in here too
[1:04:06] um you moved back to
[1:04:08] Columbus after after your big mom passed
[1:04:11] away because I started pastoring the old
[1:04:13] church that's right and
[1:04:15] then we eventually ended up moving here
[1:04:19] um
[1:04:19] let's do I'll I'll bring this up you
[1:04:22] were in Canada
[1:04:24] and you saw this girl walk down the
[1:04:26] aisle stuck up stuck up with their nose
[1:04:29] in the air and you attacked your buddy
[1:04:32] and said I want to marry that girl I
[1:04:34] said that one day will be my wife when
[1:04:37] was that when was that well that what we
[1:04:39] married in 97 that would have been
[1:04:41] several years before then I don't know
[1:04:43] exactly what year it would have been
[1:04:45] that I saw her the first time but we
[1:04:48] married in 1997. now where do you want
[1:04:50] me to go in the story to Mama or or or
[1:04:53] to when I moved here or what let's go to
[1:04:56] let's go to Mom and let's start okay
[1:04:58] well I was already living here and uh
[1:05:02] it's kind of an interesting story I was
[1:05:05] preaching
[1:05:06] um
[1:05:08] it's very interesting that you would say
[1:05:10] that because uh I got a text today from
[1:05:15] a sister in our church on my birthday
[1:05:17] who said I heard you preach
[1:05:20] in Michigan I think she said 31 years
[1:05:24] ago this week or something like that the
[1:05:28] first time was 31 and in that meeting in
[1:05:32] Michigan
[1:05:33] there was a couple from New Brunswick
[1:05:35] Canada that had come down with a quilt
[1:05:37] that a sister had made of the life and
[1:05:41] Ministry of brother Branham she'd made a
[1:05:42] quilt of the significant stories in his
[1:05:45] life and there was a brother and sister
[1:05:47] from Canada who brought that quilt down
[1:05:49] and showed it to uh in the fellowship
[1:05:52] hall to anybody who wanted to see it it
[1:05:54] was unbelievable you haven't I haven't
[1:05:56] that's what I thought but I didn't get
[1:05:58] it and yeah I tried to buy it I offered
[1:06:02] them a thousand dollars which was lots
[1:06:06] of money for me and lots of money for
[1:06:08] them in there in the early 90s but but
[1:06:11] they said no that sister wouldn't sell
[1:06:12] it she just let us borrow it to come
[1:06:14] down here but I really wanted the quilt
[1:06:16] I really wanted it but anyway uh come to
[1:06:20] find out years later it was it was your
[1:06:23] mother's mother yep Nanny Whitaker who
[1:06:26] made that quilt so I got the quilt but I
[1:06:29] had to marry the daughter together hey
[1:06:31] but it was a blessing no I was up
[1:06:33] preaching in New Brunswick Canada and a
[1:06:36] brother and sister walked in with their
[1:06:37] daughter your mom Stacy and she walked
[1:06:40] in and her nose was up in the air and
[1:06:43] and she was beautiful she was beautiful
[1:06:46] and and I just put we were sitting on
[1:06:48] the back row waiting for my turn to get
[1:06:50] up and preach and I just punched my
[1:06:51] buddy and I said you see that girl right
[1:06:53] there one of these to that's going to be
[1:06:55] my wife and he laughed you know and and
[1:06:58] said something like you're right like
[1:07:01] she's not gonna give you the time of day
[1:07:03] because we had just seen how she walked
[1:07:05] in and it was four or five years later
[1:07:08] before we married yeah but I learned her
[1:07:11] family I met her family found out she
[1:07:13] was the woman with the quilt and loved
[1:07:16] that story and uh went and visited her
[1:07:19] parents many times and they came here
[1:07:22] many times and your mom came here for
[1:07:24] the ministry many times and stayed with
[1:07:26] uh a sister Judith that you
[1:07:30] and she stayed there when she would come
[1:07:32] to visit and I fell in love with her and
[1:07:36] um I I didn't know if she would ever
[1:07:38] ever reciprocate I didn't know if she
[1:07:41] would ever love me I I and but uh in 97
[1:07:46] uh she was here for a visit and
[1:07:49] uh we all some of us went on a trip
[1:07:52] there was lots of lots of uh young
[1:07:55] people and and that went on a trip uh to
[1:07:58] to uh Helen Georgia and to Stone
[1:08:01] Mountain you've been to Stone Mountain
[1:08:03] and uh I just told her on this trip I
[1:08:06] really care about you and and uh I would
[1:08:10] love to have a relationship with you and
[1:08:13] I don't remember exactly what she said
[1:08:15] but she let me know that there was
[1:08:16] something there and I remember sitting
[1:08:19] on the top of Stone Mountain and telling
[1:08:21] your mom if you're I was so broken at
[1:08:24] that time I'd been through a real
[1:08:27] nervous time maybe you could almost call
[1:08:29] it an emotional breakdown really it was
[1:08:32] I don't like saying that but it was
[1:08:35] um I was just really broken and we had
[1:08:39] had some issues come up in the church
[1:08:40] and I was just broken and I remember
[1:08:42] sitting on the top of Stone Mountain and
[1:08:44] saying to her if you are in love with
[1:08:48] the preacher
[1:08:49] I don't know if I'll ever preach again
[1:08:52] that's how I felt at the moment I don't
[1:08:55] know if I'll ever preach again so if
[1:08:57] that's
[1:08:57] what it is about me that you love I I
[1:09:00] don't want to be I don't want to be
[1:09:01] dishonest with you I may end up being a
[1:09:04] trash man
[1:09:06] uh so if that's what you love but if you
[1:09:08] love me then I'd like for us to see
[1:09:11] where this will go and and uh let's see
[1:09:14] it was uh September uh no August August
[1:09:18] the 28th of 97 I asked her to marry me
[1:09:22] and three months later on November 28th
[1:09:25] we were married so that's awesome and
[1:09:27] God healed me you know He restored me
[1:09:30] and restored my mind and my emotions and
[1:09:33] I've done a lot of preaching since then
[1:09:35] but at that moment I I was I was so
[1:09:38] disappointed in people and I was
[1:09:40] disappointed with myself and how I had
[1:09:44] let problems affect me and I didn't know
[1:09:47] if I'd ever go on but you know we all
[1:09:49] get to those Dark Nights of the Soul
[1:09:51] those places where we question who we
[1:09:54] are and uh am I doing what I'm supposed
[1:09:56] to do but God just confirmed it to me
[1:09:59] and so we married in November of 27 a
[1:10:02] year later Benjamin came a couple years
[1:10:05] later UK aimed in Libya than Mariah
[1:10:08] and I'm I'm blessed I'm so so blessed
[1:10:13] God gave me the best when he gave me
[1:10:16] your mama I'll tell you that right now
[1:10:17] for sure
[1:10:19] um she's special but before that
[1:10:22] my grandmother did pass away in
[1:10:25] September of 90. and before she passed
[1:10:29] away she asked me would I would you
[1:10:32] consider coming back and pastoring the
[1:10:34] church here and and teaching these
[1:10:37] people what you've taught me
[1:10:39] and I said yes ma'am I believe that's
[1:10:41] what the Lord's calling me to do there
[1:10:43] was a time I thought I'd spend the rest
[1:10:45] of my life in South Carolina
[1:10:47] but I felt the pool
[1:10:49] and um
[1:10:51] and I agreed I told her that I would
[1:10:52] that that would have been of the end of
[1:10:55] July of 90. and so I started coming down
[1:10:58] every weekend in August of 90 and she
[1:11:02] passed away the first weekend of
[1:11:06] September of 90. so I actually started
[1:11:09] preaching every Sunday the first of
[1:11:12] first weekend of August of 90. and and
[1:11:15] God moved but there were only a handful
[1:11:17] of people left because of her sickness
[1:11:19] and her kind of stepping down and people
[1:11:22] not really knowing what all was going on
[1:11:24] and after I had been here a few weeks
[1:11:26] some of the few that was left left
[1:11:28] uh they weren't going to take this this
[1:11:31] new way I was able to baptize a few of
[1:11:34] them in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:11:35] Christ but two weeks after my
[1:11:38] grandmother passed away believer started
[1:11:41] showing up I was about to ask they just
[1:11:43] started showing up did they know about
[1:11:46] it they just began to hear uh Jonathan
[1:11:49] hollis's dad brother Marion Hollis heard
[1:11:51] that I had received this truth and he
[1:11:55] started coming and telling others and
[1:11:57] and I met the wallaces and I I met so
[1:12:00] many precious families and the next
[1:12:02] thing you know we just started filling
[1:12:04] up I was just thinking a lot of those
[1:12:06] people that
[1:12:08] started at the old church are still with
[1:12:10] us I mean a lot of a lot of them have
[1:12:12] gone to be with the Lord yes but but
[1:12:14] they're kids and and yes you know now
[1:12:16] I'm pastoring their children their
[1:12:19] grandchildren
[1:12:20] and their great-grandchildren I mean uh
[1:12:23] I've been here long enough now uh 33
[1:12:27] years uh this this year will be 33 years
[1:12:30] of pastoring this church and 48 years of
[1:12:35] ministry and so I'm blessed now to to uh
[1:12:40] baptize the children of
[1:12:43] of the children yeah
[1:12:46] the grandchildren that's crazy young
[1:12:48] marriage that's crazy to think about God
[1:12:50] God's been so good to us
[1:12:52] um but the church in Columbus you know
[1:12:55] it was a nice building and we enjoyed
[1:12:57] worshiping there but God began to give a
[1:12:59] vision of a of a piece of property and
[1:13:03] he he gave me a couple of visions and
[1:13:05] and I saw a cedar trees
[1:13:09] on the property in a certain pattern and
[1:13:13] uh and God began to speak and he said I
[1:13:16] want you to build a refuge for eagles
[1:13:18] and that's why this Campground is called
[1:13:21] Eagle's Refuge is because it was the
[1:13:24] word of the Lord that began to direct us
[1:13:25] and I went to several other pieces of
[1:13:27] property uh with a real estate agent and
[1:13:30] I I loved one I fell in love with one
[1:13:33] but I couldn't make it Fifth Division I
[1:13:36] couldn't make it work and so finally
[1:13:38] they brought us to this piece of
[1:13:40] property we only had 50 acres at that
[1:13:42] time
[1:13:43] and um
[1:13:46] or 48 I think maybe in the beginning but
[1:13:49] um it was stripped it had just been
[1:13:52] stripped for lumber uh hardwood it had
[1:13:55] ruts it was ugly there was a one thing
[1:13:58] pretty about this piece of property not
[1:14:00] one but I told the lady I said now thank
[1:14:04] you for showing it to me let me spend
[1:14:06] some time out here and I'll get back
[1:14:07] with you and she she left Miss Faye I
[1:14:10] just thought of her name and I just went
[1:14:13] on a walk and I walked down down and
[1:14:15] climbed down a hill come around and
[1:14:17] started up a hill
[1:14:18] and uh my sh I looked out my shoe was
[1:14:21] untied I stooped down to tie my shoe and
[1:14:24] and there was a Fallen Tree there so I
[1:14:26] put my foot up on that and tied my shoe
[1:14:28] and when I looked up there were the
[1:14:30] cedar trees that I had already described
[1:14:32] to the church people from the vision and
[1:14:34] I knew this was it and it didn't matter
[1:14:36] to me if it was red mud and it is it
[1:14:38] didn't matter to me if it was ugly and
[1:14:40] it was I knew and when God began to talk
[1:14:44] to me about building that steel
[1:14:45] Tabernacle down there that we use for so
[1:14:47] many they said it wouldn't be possible
[1:14:48] to be they told me it was the Builder
[1:14:50] said it's impossible we can't put it
[1:14:52] there the the ground will not sustain
[1:14:55] that kind of a building a still
[1:14:57] structure like that and finally an
[1:14:59] Assembly of God builder in this town Mr
[1:15:02] Webb he's passed away now his sons I
[1:15:05] think still built here but he come out
[1:15:08] and he said pastor preacher if you see
[1:15:11] it in a vision I can build it it's still
[1:15:13] standing it's powerful he said if you
[1:15:15] see it in a vision I can build it and he
[1:15:17] told him he said we're going to build it
[1:15:19] because I believe this man I believe he
[1:15:21] saw it and and it's there and one day we
[1:15:24] hope to restore it and close it in and
[1:15:27] continue to use it for the glory of God
[1:15:29] the first buildings we raised up on this
[1:15:32] property were the two prayer chapels
[1:15:34] dedicated to prayer and then we put the
[1:15:37] steel Tabernacle in and then many years
[1:15:39] later uh 2005 or six I believe it was we
[1:15:44] built this church here and so now
[1:15:46] everything is here we don't we don't uh
[1:15:49] we sold the property in Columbus and we
[1:15:52] truly believe that the best days of this
[1:15:55] piece of property are ahead that God has
[1:15:58] some glorious things he wants to do
[1:16:00] Among Us and he's given us this property
[1:16:02] for that purpose and we started the
[1:16:04] process of paying it off three years ago
[1:16:07] God put it on brother West Greeley's
[1:16:09] heart our associate pastor that it was
[1:16:11] time that we needed to be better
[1:16:13] stewards of what God had given us we
[1:16:15] were making the payment uh but that's
[1:16:18] all we were we were you know almost a
[1:16:21] half a million dollars in debt and uh
[1:16:24] from from everything everything we owed
[1:16:27] the property the buildings the school
[1:16:29] building everything had all rolled into
[1:16:31] one and uh he began to to share the
[1:16:34] burden with the people and the people
[1:16:36] began to give and uh we are we are uh
[1:16:41] let right at a hundred and sixty
[1:16:43] thousand is all we owe now we've had
[1:16:45] over 300 000 come in in the last couple
[1:16:48] of years
[1:16:49] uh God's been amazing this March will be
[1:16:53] three years I think but but it has been
[1:16:56] amazing and we've it's him it's just him
[1:16:58] and once it's paid off it'll be a great
[1:17:01] it'll be a great blessing and and a
[1:17:03] relief yeah for sure uh we're just so
[1:17:06] thankful
[1:17:07] because I'm excited for that um we're
[1:17:10] gonna do I'm gonna touch on one other
[1:17:11] subject before I ask you a bunch of
[1:17:13] questions because I actually posted on
[1:17:15] Facebook got some questions from people
[1:17:16] in our church all right but uh I won't
[1:17:18] touch on one of the subject
[1:17:20] um
[1:17:21] when did you get a burden for Israel and
[1:17:25] start
[1:17:26] well that's a big one that's a big
[1:17:28] question I I received a burden for
[1:17:31] Israel to pray for Israel and a love for
[1:17:34] Israel when I was 11 years old that's
[1:17:37] right 55 today I was 11. uh in 1979 my
[1:17:43] grandmother uh
[1:17:46] wanted to go to Israel for the first
[1:17:48] time
[1:17:49] and wanted to take me I take that back
[1:17:52] she may have been in a couple years
[1:17:55] before I thought you had 77. I think she
[1:17:58] went in 77 and wanted me to go but I was
[1:18:02] in school but in 79 a trip from a local
[1:18:05] church here in town uh it happened to
[1:18:08] later be the church that I graduated
[1:18:10] from their school okay
[1:18:12] um but they got a trip up and she wanted
[1:18:15] to go and wanted to take me and and she
[1:18:18] got she helped make arrangements with my
[1:18:19] teachers to let me go
[1:18:27] she just stood up in church one night
[1:18:29] and she said I feel led of the Lord that
[1:18:31] Steve needs a trip to Israel now in his
[1:18:34] formative years
[1:18:37] and people gave and and let me just tell
[1:18:40] you this from the last podcast that
[1:18:42] little lady that reached in with the
[1:18:44] colors of fire she gave the first
[1:18:45] hundred dollars she didn't have it to
[1:18:47] give
[1:18:48] she didn't have it to give but she loved
[1:18:51] me so much and believed in my Ministry
[1:18:53] what God had called me to do she gave
[1:18:55] the first offering toward that but
[1:18:57] anyway the money was raised my mother
[1:18:59] reluctantly agreed to let me go
[1:19:03] and my grandmother took me and while
[1:19:05] we're in Jerusalem we went to the the
[1:19:09] Museum of the Holocaust Yad vashem the
[1:19:13] memorial of the name and it was in the
[1:19:15] old location now it is a magnificent
[1:19:18] Museum and a beautiful location
[1:19:21] overlooking on Karim the village of John
[1:19:24] the Baptist in those days it was quite
[1:19:26] small and more primitive and there was a
[1:19:30] place in that museum where you would go
[1:19:33] and stand in a room and they would play
[1:19:35] very solemn music and the walls were
[1:19:38] filled with
[1:19:40] a mural of the bodies of the Jewish
[1:19:44] people that had been killed and piled up
[1:19:47] in the Holocaust
[1:19:48] and so you're literally standing in a
[1:19:51] room surrounded from even the door back
[1:19:54] of the door was covered with this so it
[1:19:56] it was it was quite emotional to see all
[1:20:00] those bodies most of them stripped of
[1:20:01] their clothes and piled up ready to be
[1:20:04] buried in ditches or burned
[1:20:07] and being 11 years old I knew a little
[1:20:10] of the Holocaust but I certainly learned
[1:20:12] what I needed to know that day and the
[1:20:15] the I was the only child on the tour
[1:20:17] group in the tour group mostly seniors
[1:20:20] and the tour of God at Yad vashem said
[1:20:24] to my grandmother this may be too much
[1:20:26] for him and maybe he would wait on the
[1:20:29] other side until we passed through and
[1:20:31] she said no I really believe it would be
[1:20:33] good for him and the lady said
[1:20:34] absolutely fine then and we went in and
[1:20:37] and Joshua what happened was as they
[1:20:39] begin to play the music and tell
[1:20:42] some of the story of what we were seeing
[1:20:45] the the spirit of the Lord fell on me I
[1:20:47] was 11. I began to weep in the spirit
[1:20:51] and travail for the Jewish people
[1:20:54] and I Heard a Voice
[1:20:56] that said son of man can these bones
[1:21:01] live again what was happening is in the
[1:21:03] spirit I was reliving the experience of
[1:21:06] Ezekiel
[1:21:08] and this I mean as close to it as as
[1:21:11] possible
[1:21:12] uh and it it was like the walls were
[1:21:16] alive it was it was like what I was
[1:21:18] seeing was no longer a picture and I was
[1:21:20] literally standing there and I said what
[1:21:22] Ezekiel said I answered the voice uh
[1:21:26] Lord thou knowest and I went through the
[1:21:29] whole thing these bones coming together
[1:21:32] and and skin and sinew coming up and and
[1:21:35] before it was over it was a mighty Army
[1:21:38] like like Ezekiel a god Gathering the
[1:21:42] the dry bones of Israel and and making a
[1:21:45] nation again
[1:21:46] a powerful Army again and I was weeping
[1:21:50] so hard that I had to you know kind of
[1:21:52] hold on to the wall to get out of there
[1:21:54] and my granny said what happened to you
[1:21:56] and I said I all I know big mama is I
[1:22:00] have never loved like I love today
[1:22:04] I love the Jewish people and I love this
[1:22:08] land of Israel God has given me a love
[1:22:11] so it started in in 1979 as an election
[1:22:15] how many times have you been back I have
[1:22:17] been over 25 times to Israel and
[1:22:21] regrettably it has been a few years now
[1:22:23] but I I feel like I I will go again and
[1:22:27] my purpose for going uh was not to
[1:22:31] evangelize my purpose was to go in just
[1:22:33] love just love people and support the
[1:22:37] people and be a light to the Jewish
[1:22:40] people now it's such a beautiful place
[1:22:42] I've got to say this it is an
[1:22:44] unbelievable Place once you've been
[1:22:46] you'll understand a little bit about
[1:22:48] what it's like to love I would say and
[1:22:50] to think about like you're walking where
[1:22:51] Jesus walked or could have walked is
[1:22:53] it's incredible it's incredible and it's
[1:22:57] really on my heart to host a tour to
[1:23:00] Israel next year so I hope and pray that
[1:23:03] the details will come come together and
[1:23:05] we can make it a reality I've had people
[1:23:07] ask for 20 years
[1:23:09] and take us and and I'd love to do that
[1:23:12] but I wanted it to be at the right time
[1:23:14] uh but but but God you know has made a
[1:23:19] way for us to continue to go back and
[1:23:22] and just to love and to learn we've
[1:23:24] learned so much from precious families
[1:23:27] that live there and uh our precious
[1:23:30] friend Rabbi David Friedman of of
[1:23:33] blessed memory who went to be with the
[1:23:35] Lord during the covid pandemic he taught
[1:23:39] us so much about the biblical roots of
[1:23:42] the faith and and what it means uh to to
[1:23:46] you know live the scripture yeah to walk
[1:23:49] it out but I I got to tell this if you
[1:23:52] since you asked that question
[1:23:54] um
[1:23:55] my mother's father Edwin Lamar Ellis was
[1:24:01] a soldier in the Army and uh he uh
[1:24:05] wanted to know
[1:24:07] the heritage of his family
[1:24:10] and he asked parents grandparents and
[1:24:12] nobody would really tell him about the
[1:24:14] old country
[1:24:16] um and when he got back they promised
[1:24:19] him you come back we'll tell you the
[1:24:20] whole story uh they were gone they had
[1:24:23] passed away and so he he died when I was
[1:24:27] five 50 years ago
[1:24:30] um he died not knowing his roots but
[1:24:33] having a longing a passion to know where
[1:24:37] he had come from I always suspected
[1:24:40] after the 11 year old experience that I
[1:24:43] was somehow uh had Jewish blood but had
[1:24:47] no way of proving it and Shelley itself
[1:24:49] is certainly not a Jewish name
[1:24:51] particularly
[1:24:52] and so but I just had this sense and
[1:24:56] then some years ago I was in Israel with
[1:24:59] a couple of the brothers from our church
[1:25:00] and your poppy Mama's dad brother
[1:25:03] Whitaker
[1:25:04] and I went to the Museum of the diaspora
[1:25:08] which is the museum that that documents
[1:25:12] the scattering of the Jewish people and
[1:25:14] they have a database there and uh I had
[1:25:17] some names of Grandfather
[1:25:19] great-grandfather
[1:25:21] great-great-grandfather I saw that the
[1:25:23] name their last name spelling had been
[1:25:27] changed it was once Elias or Elias e l i
[1:25:32] a s now it had become Ellis e-l-l-i-s
[1:25:38] um and I had all that and I wanted to
[1:25:41] use the computer and there was a
[1:25:43] holocaust Survivor who was hosting
[1:25:46] people in that in that little room
[1:25:48] precious little short Jewish lady showed
[1:25:51] me the tattoo on her arm from the
[1:25:54] concentration camp and she said so you
[1:25:57] want to you want to prove you're Jewish
[1:26:00] and I said I I don't know if I am I just
[1:26:03] want to know if my family was Jewish and
[1:26:06] I explained to her about my grandfather
[1:26:08] dying and never knowing and she said
[1:26:10] well you know let me let me talk to you
[1:26:13] a minute and she said it's a wonderful
[1:26:15] database but it's incomplete and she
[1:26:18] said to this day no one really has been
[1:26:21] able to come not knowing that they were
[1:26:25] Jewish and prove that they're Jewish but
[1:26:27] if you already know you're Jewish it's
[1:26:29] been very helpful for people to to be
[1:26:31] able to search out some of their
[1:26:33] ancestry so she said but you know who
[1:26:36] who knows no no loss doesn't hurt to try
[1:26:41] so I just sat down the computer and it
[1:26:43] you know and I typed in the names that I
[1:26:46] knew and hit enter and all of a sudden
[1:26:49] right in front of the screen it began to
[1:26:51] unfold like this my whole family your
[1:26:55] family history
[1:26:56] and I began to learn that that that my
[1:27:00] great-grandparents on my mother's side
[1:27:02] were Lithuanian Jews they were Jews from
[1:27:05] Lithuania and when they came to America
[1:27:08] they hid their jewishness and they did
[1:27:12] that because it was still a time a great
[1:27:16] time of anti-Semitism even like even
[1:27:18] like today the Jews are a hated people
[1:27:20] even today and so they put away their
[1:27:23] traditions in fact uh some of my great
[1:27:27] uncles joined the Catholic church not to
[1:27:30] be Catholics but took the hive but to
[1:27:33] hide
[1:27:34] and and so it it hurts me to know that
[1:27:38] my grandfather died not knowing but I'm
[1:27:41] so blessed to know it helps explain why
[1:27:45] I love the Jewish people so and why I
[1:27:47] love Israel so and I I think
[1:27:51] I think people would understand it more
[1:27:54] if they have if they've ever been to
[1:27:55] Israel like one time I mean that's all
[1:27:57] it takes yeah it is it is life-changing
[1:28:00] like without a doubt I mean there's so I
[1:28:03] mean there's so much things you can do
[1:28:04] but
[1:28:05] just I mean there's a Bible story for
[1:28:08] every place you go to yeah that's that's
[1:28:09] right it's amazing that's absolutely
[1:28:11] right you've stood as a little boy in
[1:28:14] the in the dry creek bed of the valley
[1:28:17] of elah where David reached down and
[1:28:19] picked up those five Stones like yeah
[1:28:23] and and and knocked down the Giant and
[1:28:26] you've been baptized in the river where
[1:28:27] Jesus was baptized and you have walked
[1:28:31] down the steps coming down out of uh the
[1:28:35] the house of Caiaphas the high priest on
[1:28:38] the night that Jesus was betrayed there
[1:28:41] are steps Stone steps that come down uh
[1:28:44] uh near the Church of uh Saint Peter of
[1:28:47] galicantu
[1:28:48] uh and the ruins of the House of
[1:28:51] Caiaphas the high priest there are these
[1:28:53] uh beautiful ancient stones that go down
[1:28:57] into the valley toward Gethsemane and We
[1:29:01] Know by the scripture that Jesus
[1:29:02] ascended
[1:29:04] those stones those steps they they've
[1:29:07] been dated over 2 000 years old so you
[1:29:10] have climbed there's not too many places
[1:29:13] that you can you can actually walk the
[1:29:16] street but that's one of the places that
[1:29:18] you know that you are actually climbing
[1:29:21] the steps that Jesus climbed in in his
[1:29:24] great Agony and and it's not that
[1:29:26] there's some power in the step or some
[1:29:29] virtue it's just the knowing of like you
[1:29:32] just you just took steps for Jesus it's
[1:29:34] just that that great feeling yeah you
[1:29:36] know just like when I go to Tucson and I
[1:29:39] go to Sabino Canyon and I see some of
[1:29:41] those places where brother Branham had
[1:29:44] great experiences with God I may not get
[1:29:46] quite the same feeling but I get a warm
[1:29:49] feeling that says wow God really showed
[1:29:52] up here exactly and I was a part of it
[1:29:54] in some way so yeah go to Israel take a
[1:29:58] visit or wait until 2024 and make it to
[1:30:01] it maybe go with us in 2024. so
[1:30:04] before we're done we got some questions
[1:30:06] we got to ask you okay
[1:30:09] let me get it pulled up if I didn't have
[1:30:11] it ready but
[1:30:13] we I post on if you didn't see it I'm
[1:30:15] going to try to do this for pretty much
[1:30:18] everybody that I have on I'm going to
[1:30:20] try to post and get like a q a so if you
[1:30:22] have questions for that person you can
[1:30:24] post them so if you're not on our
[1:30:25] private Facebook page
[1:30:28] you need to get on it especially if
[1:30:30] you're from a church all right if
[1:30:32] they're not from the church they can
[1:30:33] post they can say yeah they can send it
[1:30:35] to me they can send it to they can send
[1:30:37] an email to the church and we'll get
[1:30:39] them to you or we have a public Facebook
[1:30:41] page and they can inbox it that way but
[1:30:43] if they have questions if you happen to
[1:30:45] announce a guest they have questions for
[1:30:47] that guest we can get the questions
[1:30:50] so let's see
[1:30:51] all right first one
[1:30:54] do you have a favorite scriptural or
[1:30:57] theological God topic what is the what
[1:30:59] is your favorite thing to talk about
[1:31:01] Slash Fellowship around I hope this
[1:31:03] makes sense well I gotta be honest the
[1:31:05] question did not make sense to me
[1:31:07] but we had already to me and dad already
[1:31:08] talked about it and so I was I hope it
[1:31:10] makes sense to you because you're the
[1:31:11] one that's answering that it makes sense
[1:31:13] to me I got it I get it
[1:31:16] um I mean I love the scripture I mean I
[1:31:19] love the Bible and and so there are
[1:31:21] there are I mean it's endless I I but
[1:31:26] but there are some subjects that I feel
[1:31:28] very passionate about and it's generally
[1:31:31] those that have been so misunderstood so
[1:31:34] I would like to to read a scripture or
[1:31:37] two but I'll I'll try to be a quick uh
[1:31:40] to answer that question one of my
[1:31:43] favorite Bible themes is the sovereignty
[1:31:46] of God it it it it it well the word
[1:31:50] sovereignty means to exercise Supreme
[1:31:54] and independent Authority and when I got
[1:31:58] a revelation from the scripture that God
[1:32:01] is Sovereign and that he exercises
[1:32:04] Supreme and independent Authority
[1:32:07] Authority it answered so many questions
[1:32:09] for me and it relieved a lot of fears
[1:32:12] that I had in my life and let me just
[1:32:15] give you an example of that in the
[1:32:17] scripture in Isaiah 54 verse 16 and 17
[1:32:21] in the Amplified version of the Bible it
[1:32:24] says behold I have created the Smith who
[1:32:29] blows on the fires of coals
[1:32:32] and who produces a weapon for its
[1:32:35] purpose and I have created the
[1:32:38] Devastator to destroy so the prophet
[1:32:41] Isaiah understood sovereignty and he's
[1:32:44] saying that before there was an enemy to
[1:32:47] fight let's just say an army to fight
[1:32:49] out there it was God who chose the Smith
[1:32:53] The Man Who Would Forge the weapons
[1:32:59] that would be placed in the hands of of
[1:33:02] let's say the Hebrew Army to fight an
[1:33:06] enemy so God already saw the enemy he
[1:33:09] already saw an army that needed the
[1:33:11] weapons he already determined what
[1:33:13] weapon would be uh most successful in
[1:33:17] the battle and he creates a Smith
[1:33:20] he creates a Craftsman
[1:33:23] to make the weapon to put in the hand of
[1:33:27] the right one to fight the battle that
[1:33:29] needs to be fought I mean that is the
[1:33:31] sovereignty of God that is God
[1:33:34] exercising Supreme and independent
[1:33:36] Authority the next verse is important
[1:33:38] because it says but no weapon
[1:33:42] that is formed against you shall prosper
[1:33:44] and every tongue that shall rise against
[1:33:47] you in judgment you shall show to be in
[1:33:49] the wrong this peace righteousness
[1:33:52] security Triumph and over opposition is
[1:33:56] the heritage of the Servants of the Lord
[1:33:58] those in whom the ideal servant of the
[1:34:01] Lord is reproduced this is the
[1:34:03] righteousness or the Vindication which
[1:34:05] they obtained from me this is that which
[1:34:08] I impart to them as their justification
[1:34:11] says the Lord so God is saying I'm in
[1:34:14] control in Romans 8 29 I've read this
[1:34:18] verse all my life but it wasn't until I
[1:34:20] had a revelation of the sovereignty of
[1:34:22] God that I really got it it says and we
[1:34:25] know that all things work together for
[1:34:28] good to them that love God all things
[1:34:33] all things good bad and ugly all things
[1:34:37] work together to them who are the called
[1:34:40] according to his purpose for whom he did
[1:34:43] for no he also did predestinate to be
[1:34:46] conformed molded to the image of his son
[1:34:49] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:34:52] many Brethren and then I saw the
[1:34:54] question so I chose one quotation from
[1:34:57] Brother Branham that I think is is so
[1:34:59] fitting uh in the message who is this
[1:35:02] Melchizedek 65. brother Branham said and
[1:35:06] if he isn't infinite he isn't God
[1:35:10] God has to be infinite we are finite he
[1:35:15] is infinite or infinite
[1:35:17] and he was omnipresent omniscient and
[1:35:21] omnipotent if he isn't then he can't be
[1:35:24] God knows all things all places because
[1:35:28] of his Omni because of his omniscience
[1:35:31] omniscience makes him omnipresent he is
[1:35:34] a being he's not like the wind he's a
[1:35:36] being he dwells in a house but being
[1:35:38] omniscient knows all things now listen
[1:35:41] to this this really you know tickles me
[1:35:45] I guess you'd say he said there can't be
[1:35:47] a flea
[1:35:49] that bats his eye
[1:35:52] that God doesn't know about it you see
[1:35:55] the sovereignty of God
[1:35:57] and he noted before there was a world
[1:36:00] how many times that bat would blink his
[1:36:04] eyes and how much Tallow or fat it had
[1:36:07] in it before there ever was a world
[1:36:10] that is infinite we can't comprehend it
[1:36:13] in our minds but that's God God infinite
[1:36:18] so that word infinite is so similar to
[1:36:20] the word sovereign and so even though
[1:36:23] bad things happen to us sometime and and
[1:36:26] situations happen that aren't Pleasant
[1:36:29] the Bible said all things work together
[1:36:31] for good we find out that God even
[1:36:35] creates the Destroyer he created the
[1:36:38] enemy because he knows exactly what it
[1:36:42] will take in fact it could be summed up
[1:36:44] like this all things serve God in this
[1:36:48] process to bring to pass his perfect
[1:36:52] will
[1:36:53] so I I could go on Paul in Philippians
[1:36:55] and I won't even read it but in
[1:36:57] Philippians 1 12 through 14 Paul who's
[1:37:01] been through so much Shipwrecked beaten
[1:37:04] stoned bruised bloodied he makes a
[1:37:08] comment that these things have happened
[1:37:10] to me for a purpose for a reason and in
[1:37:14] fact he also says uh that it caused me
[1:37:18] to wax confident in my in my bonds
[1:37:22] and it makes me Bolder to speak the word
[1:37:25] without fear so the things that happen
[1:37:28] to us in our lives mold us and shape us
[1:37:31] they give us confidence they take fear
[1:37:34] from us they make us bold
[1:37:36] um they're not always easy to go through
[1:37:38] but when you get a revelation that God
[1:37:42] is love and that God loves me and that
[1:37:45] if he he may not be the originator of
[1:37:48] everything that happens to me but
[1:37:50] because he loves me sometimes he allows
[1:37:53] things to happen to me because he knows
[1:37:55] the outcome
[1:37:57] he knows that if if certain people walk
[1:38:00] through certain things they would Curse
[1:38:01] God and die
[1:38:03] but he knew that job was not such a man
[1:38:07] and he knew that if he tested job and
[1:38:10] tried job that job would come out even
[1:38:13] more righteous in the end and his life
[1:38:15] would be even a greater testimony to the
[1:38:18] truth of who God Is So sovereignty is
[1:38:21] one of my favorite biblical themes and
[1:38:24] it runs from Genesis all the way to
[1:38:26] Revelation and like you're just saying
[1:38:27] though you got to remember everything
[1:38:29] happens for a reason it does I mean some
[1:38:31] of that we're extremely close to that's
[1:38:33] what he tells us all the time is you got
[1:38:34] to remember everything happens for a
[1:38:36] reason everything half a reason and and
[1:38:38] it's sometimes it's hard to understand
[1:38:40] what's the reasoning right then in that
[1:38:42] moment but it it all works out for his
[1:38:45] glory you got to try to keep a good
[1:38:47] attitude you got to try to keep a good
[1:38:49] spirit it's not sin to ask God why no
[1:38:52] but you may not get the answer when you
[1:38:55] want it
[1:38:57] um because he he's not obligated to
[1:38:59] answer every every question when we want
[1:39:01] the answer but it'll come it'd be easy
[1:39:04] that way but that's not how yeah that's
[1:39:05] it it's his perfect time it will come
[1:39:08] the answer will come in time I can tell
[1:39:11] you this that I've gone through things I
[1:39:13] told you a minute ago about about what I
[1:39:15] was going through in 96 and 97 darkest
[1:39:18] night I you know I made mistakes
[1:39:22] um in in my hurt and pain and it was
[1:39:25] just a dark time and I needed God and I
[1:39:29] I couldn't see any good
[1:39:32] you know it felt like the ceiling was
[1:39:35] closing in and the walls were closing in
[1:39:37] and and I probably even made the
[1:39:39] statement you know how could God get
[1:39:41] glory in this
[1:39:43] but
[1:39:45] if you would have you know many people
[1:39:46] in that moment probably petted me on the
[1:39:49] back and said you'll get through this
[1:39:50] and there's a reason I didn't I just
[1:39:52] couldn't see it but looking back a few
[1:39:55] years later looking back you realize oh
[1:39:59] my God had a plan had that not happened
[1:40:02] to me I don't know where I would be or
[1:40:04] what mess I would be in so God used even
[1:40:07] those dark moments to mold me to shape
[1:40:10] me to make me a better a better man so I
[1:40:14] I guess that's one of my very favorites
[1:40:16] is knowing it's not my responsibility I
[1:40:19] think I just hit my microphone it's not
[1:40:22] my responsibility it's God's
[1:40:23] responsibility to bring about his
[1:40:25] ultimate purpose it's my responsibility
[1:40:28] to yield to him he knows best Papa knows
[1:40:32] best he does
[1:40:34] um the next one is what is the most
[1:40:37] outstanding Miracle you've ever
[1:40:39] witnessed well two come to mind I don't
[1:40:41] know how much time we have left but two
[1:40:43] things to mine
[1:40:45] um one is well I've seen the dead raised
[1:40:49] I mean that's pretty powerful and at
[1:40:52] least twice in my life perhaps three
[1:40:55] times I've seen the dead Rays someone
[1:40:58] who was pronounced dead uh by by medical
[1:41:02] authorities and and God raised them from
[1:41:05] the dead one was a precious sister whose
[1:41:08] name was Sister lock and she died in a
[1:41:11] service a nurse pronounced her dead and
[1:41:12] God raised her I've seen blind eyes open
[1:41:15] I've seen deaf ears unstopped uh one of
[1:41:18] the two greatest Miracles that stands
[1:41:20] out because I mentioned one of them the
[1:41:22] last time we were together I talked
[1:41:23] about the young man in Indiana who lost
[1:41:26] his eyesight from a weed eater accident
[1:41:28] and God restored his eyes he actually
[1:41:31] had to create eyes because there was
[1:41:33] this the eyes were so damaged there was
[1:41:36] nothing and I saw God do that but but
[1:41:39] the number one miracle that usually
[1:41:41] comes to my mind is many years ago in
[1:41:43] South Florida I was holding a tent
[1:41:45] meeting and there was a quadriplegic
[1:41:48] some quadriplegics can move their neck
[1:41:51] and he could move his neck but he could
[1:41:54] not move any other part of his body from
[1:41:56] his neck down he had a special
[1:41:58] wheelchair that he could blow into these
[1:42:01] little tubes and inhale and exhale and
[1:42:04] he could drive himself in that
[1:42:06] wheelchair but he had to have assistance
[1:42:08] at everything and we were having a tent
[1:42:11] meeting in Florida and in South Florida
[1:42:14] and we were already in the service and
[1:42:17] God was already moving and we saw a van
[1:42:19] pull up and from where I was standing I
[1:42:22] could see the whole thing they didn't
[1:42:24] come for the tent meeting they came to
[1:42:27] empty his colostomy bag he had no
[1:42:30] ability to to function with his own way
[1:42:33] East so it was all in a bag that bag had
[1:42:36] to be emptied they were traveling they
[1:42:38] saw the portalets they saw the bat
[1:42:41] portable bathrooms and so they stopped
[1:42:43] to pour out his bag they thought this is
[1:42:46] a good good opportunity to empty the bag
[1:42:49] and they were captured as they emptied
[1:42:52] the bag and he comes uh the wife took
[1:42:55] the bag in empty and comes back uh he
[1:42:58] circled around the van in the wheelchair
[1:43:00] and I thought they were leaving uh were
[1:43:03] you preaching I was preaching by that
[1:43:05] time maybe singing getting ready to
[1:43:07] preach or whatever but I thought they
[1:43:09] were leaving and and uh we went on in
[1:43:12] the sir and all of a sudden they started
[1:43:15] coming toward the tent and uh she came
[1:43:18] and sat on the back row and he came just
[1:43:20] to the edge of the tent with the
[1:43:22] wheelchair and I'm preaching away I'm
[1:43:25] moving down among the chairs and
[1:43:26] whatever and he begins to scream out
[1:43:28] loud I see Jesus he had the ability to
[1:43:32] talk he said I see Jesus standing beside
[1:43:34] that little boy preacher wow and and I
[1:43:37] was early 20s by that time
[1:43:40] I see Jesus standing by that boy
[1:43:43] preacher and uh he starts down the aisle
[1:43:46] controlling the wheelchair with his with
[1:43:49] his breath
[1:43:50] and uh about that he gets he gets within
[1:43:53] a few feet of me
[1:43:55] and he stands up in the wheelchair and
[1:43:58] steps off the wheelchair totally healed
[1:44:01] by the power of God
[1:44:03] and that tent went crazy it erupted I
[1:44:06] mean chairs were flying and people were
[1:44:08] worshiping God and and real Revival
[1:44:11] broke out and here's what happened it
[1:44:14] was so so precious too is that we were
[1:44:17] having a morning service the next
[1:44:18] morning and they heard about it and he
[1:44:21] was giving us some of his testimony we
[1:44:23] asked him would he stay and give his
[1:44:24] testimony the next morning he was
[1:44:26] injured in Vietnam he was left in this
[1:44:29] condition he was depressed he had tried
[1:44:32] to take his life multiple times
[1:44:35] they go to a hotel I think we helped pay
[1:44:37] for the hotel although we didn't have
[1:44:38] much money in those days
[1:44:41] um but we helped him get a hotel and he
[1:44:44] actually told us the next morning he
[1:44:46] comes back to the service we give him
[1:44:49] the microphone and he begins to tell the
[1:44:51] the
[1:44:52] you know the doctor's reports and all
[1:44:54] that he went through and and the
[1:44:57] hardship of his life all these years
[1:44:59] since since the 60s in Vietnam
[1:45:02] and here's what got me is he starts
[1:45:05] talking about the joy and tears are
[1:45:08] running down his face he doesn't look
[1:45:10] very joyful but he's talking about the
[1:45:12] joy of feeding himself cereal that
[1:45:15] morning for the first time since the
[1:45:17] Vietnam War that's crazy and my tear I
[1:45:19] mean I am a mess and so is everybody
[1:45:21] else in the tent so he literally was
[1:45:24] able to move in the hotel room
[1:45:27] and and when he got out of the van the
[1:45:30] next day there was a crowd of people
[1:45:32] watching the van and he gets out of the
[1:45:34] passenger side of the van and walks
[1:45:36] Under the Tent without the wheelchair
[1:45:37] wow so totally healed so that is one of
[1:45:40] the most visibly profound now to me the
[1:45:45] greatest Miracle is when a soul is saved
[1:45:47] when somebody surrenders their life
[1:45:50] to Jesus Christ that's the greatest
[1:45:52] Miracle but when you're talking about
[1:45:54] profound and visible Miracles and
[1:45:57] physical Miracles I think God healing
[1:46:00] the quadriplegic was one of the greatest
[1:46:02] that I ever saw I don't know if I've
[1:46:04] ever
[1:46:05] I guess I've heard the story at some
[1:46:07] point but I know you have you just were
[1:46:09] probably young
[1:46:11] um
[1:46:12] we've got a couple more uh what's your
[1:46:13] favorite scripture and why is it your
[1:46:15] favorite my favorite scripture is
[1:46:17] brother branham's favorite scripture
[1:46:18] Hebrews 13 and 8. uh Jesus Christ the
[1:46:23] same yesterday and today and forever why
[1:46:26] it's because he is and it it reminds me
[1:46:30] every day that what Jesus did in his
[1:46:33] Earthly Ministry he is still able to do
[1:46:36] today so it's a revelation it's not just
[1:46:40] a scripture it's a revelation he has not
[1:46:42] changed he cannot fail
[1:46:46] um he remains ever more the same
[1:46:49] faithful and true
[1:46:53] um what is your favorite memory of
[1:46:55] brother green and brother your favorite
[1:46:57] brother Branham experience my favorite
[1:46:59] memory of brother Perry green I have
[1:47:01] many uh he was a dear man and a dear
[1:47:06] Mentor in my life and I loved him very
[1:47:09] much one of the greatest memories or
[1:47:12] privileges that I had in interacting
[1:47:14] with brother green is I got to uh host
[1:47:17] him on his last trip to Israel he loved
[1:47:21] Israel more than just about anybody I've
[1:47:23] ever known and he knew so much about
[1:47:26] Israel and when he found out that we
[1:47:29] leased an apartment in Jerusalem and we
[1:47:31] invited him to come I remember very well
[1:47:33] the day he called up and he said Steve
[1:47:35] I'm coming
[1:47:36] the the day or two before he was
[1:47:39] supposed to arrive or I was supposed to
[1:47:41] leave to get there first I ended up
[1:47:43] being in the hospital for the first time
[1:47:45] in my life with diverticulitis I had to
[1:47:48] push the doctor to release me so that I
[1:47:50] could go and be there but I wouldn't
[1:47:51] trade those days that I had with him for
[1:47:55] anything
[1:47:57] um and there there are so many more uh
[1:48:01] brother green one our one conversation
[1:48:03] that we had I mean I loved we sat up all
[1:48:06] night one night when I first met him in
[1:48:08] 1990 or 91 we sat up all night him
[1:48:12] telling me the interactions that he had
[1:48:14] had with brother Branham the
[1:48:15] conversations that he'd had the Miracles
[1:48:17] so of course I loved that
[1:48:20] um but one kind of vote of confidence
[1:48:22] that he gave me is I was speaking at a
[1:48:26] Pentecostal charismatic conference in
[1:48:28] Tucson and we invited brother green to
[1:48:30] come and give the testimony of brother
[1:48:32] branham's Ministry and uh he wanted to
[1:48:35] take us out to eat afterwards
[1:48:37] and so everybody got in the vehicle and
[1:48:39] he said Steve you come ride with me and
[1:48:40] he was Dr he was in a truck and I got in
[1:48:43] the truck and as we were driving he said
[1:48:45] I don't care what anybody says son you
[1:48:47] were built for this he said you're doing
[1:48:49] exactly what God would have you to do
[1:48:51] you're being a witness of the truth and
[1:48:55] he said loving on these people even
[1:48:57] though they may not do just like you do
[1:48:59] or you do just like they do there are
[1:49:01] many differences between you but but but
[1:49:04] God part of your birth reason is is to
[1:49:08] be who you are and and to bridge this
[1:49:10] Gap and then he looked at me and he said
[1:49:12] I don't know another man around this
[1:49:13] message that would be doing what you're
[1:49:15] doing and I just want you to know I love
[1:49:17] you and honor you for it so that to me
[1:49:20] because I grew up uh Joshua without the
[1:49:23] without the Kudos of a dad or without a
[1:49:26] dad to say I'm proud of you or you did
[1:49:28] he was good yeah he did that to me that
[1:49:30] day he was my dad that moment and for
[1:49:33] for me to know that he was proud of me
[1:49:35] instead of disappointed in me many
[1:49:37] people around the message at that time
[1:49:39] were disappointed they said he don't
[1:49:40] believe the truth anymore he's gone
[1:49:43] charismatic he's left the prophet on and
[1:49:46] on and on they said but that was never
[1:49:48] what happened but you by you doing that
[1:49:51] also has brought a lot of people to us
[1:49:53] there are many people who believe the
[1:49:55] wholeness of the Gospel now because of
[1:49:58] those influences in those days and I
[1:50:01] don't regret it I don't regret it it's
[1:50:04] just not fun being misunderstood but
[1:50:07] that was my a couple of my favorite
[1:50:09] times with brother green there were lots
[1:50:12] he was always fun to be around always
[1:50:15] fun
[1:50:16] um well not always okay most of the time
[1:50:20] um
[1:50:22] here's some guy named Benjamin wants to
[1:50:24] know who your favorite kid is oh some
[1:50:26] guy named Benjamin Benjamin it's Ezekiel
[1:50:29] my oldest son well I don't have easy I
[1:50:33] have four children uh and a
[1:50:35] daughter-in-law and I don't have any
[1:50:37] favorites I I loved you all the same and
[1:50:42] they do kid me because there's a there's
[1:50:43] one little boy in the church that that I
[1:50:46] I just love dearly and I've never told
[1:50:48] exactly why well I want to say I want to
[1:50:50] do want to say one thing about that to
[1:50:52] me Ezekiel what people don't realize is
[1:50:55] he is specialty but what people don't
[1:50:56] realize when he was a very little baby
[1:50:58] you spent we we all went on a family
[1:51:00] vacation of course they came with us and
[1:51:03] you spent hours holding him on the beach
[1:51:06] while we went and did our own things and
[1:51:08] praying and singing over him I did and I
[1:51:12] mean that's pretty I mean you know
[1:51:13] that's a little bit of a bond right
[1:51:14] there and God spoke to me now it's off
[1:51:16] topic and everything but it is I just
[1:51:19] wanted so so people I don't think you're
[1:51:21] so biased
[1:51:26] but and God spoke to me about his life
[1:51:29] and his Destiny I remember you saying
[1:51:30] and so uh so yes I I we have the most
[1:51:33] amazing children in our church I love
[1:51:35] them all they are all amazing and smart
[1:51:39] and handsome and beautiful uh but he
[1:51:42] does have a special place and and and
[1:51:44] and I won't deny that but I don't have
[1:51:47] any favorites so other than that in that
[1:51:50] way maybe a little and there was a
[1:51:51] couple other questions that you said we
[1:51:52] didn't want to give them to today so I
[1:51:54] don't think we'll have to yeah so we'll
[1:51:55] we'll pass on those but we'll definitely
[1:51:57] you know later on down the road have you
[1:52:00] back to do some other stuff and
[1:52:02] um
[1:52:03] get some more questions in and stuff
[1:52:05] like that uh but like I said I would
[1:52:08] like for you to pray again before I go
[1:52:09] off because that's something I want to
[1:52:11] do after every podcast have the guests
[1:52:14] pray and I know you did last time I
[1:52:16] would like for you to do it again and I
[1:52:17] would love it is there anything else you
[1:52:18] want to say before we I can't really
[1:52:21] think of anything except to say that you
[1:52:24] know the signs of the times are telling
[1:52:27] us that we are drawing closer
[1:52:30] and closer to the coming of the Lord
[1:52:33] and uh God doesn't have any
[1:52:36] grandchildren
[1:52:37] so if you're watching this if you've
[1:52:40] made it this far
[1:52:42] I can't imagine you know some people
[1:52:44] told me it took them two or three
[1:52:46] different settings to watch the last one
[1:52:49] but if you've made it to the end of this
[1:52:51] podcast and you do not know Jesus as
[1:52:56] your own personal savior you need to
[1:52:59] know him
[1:53:00] you need to make him Lord of your life
[1:53:04] I have served him a long time and I can
[1:53:08] say today the longer I serve him the
[1:53:12] sweeter he grows it's not always easy
[1:53:16] I'm not trying to sell you some some
[1:53:19] idea that there won't be suffering and
[1:53:22] heartache I've known my share but I can
[1:53:26] tell you that it's smooth sailing if
[1:53:28] Jesus is in the boat with you you can
[1:53:31] make it it doesn't matter how stormy it
[1:53:33] gets as long as you can look over and
[1:53:36] know that Jesus is in your boat you're
[1:53:38] in his boat you're together
[1:53:40] so I just encourage you before I pray
[1:53:44] you know you said is there anything else
[1:53:46] on my heart that's on my heart don't
[1:53:49] waste another year of your life not
[1:53:53] having peace
[1:53:54] you you you can have peace and you can
[1:53:57] know that you know that you know that
[1:54:00] your sins are forgiven
[1:54:01] and I always said salvation is a free
[1:54:05] gift but the call of God on your life
[1:54:08] will cost you everything
[1:54:10] if God has called you to serve him and
[1:54:13] to be his you'll have to be willing to
[1:54:16] give up whatever he asks but oh my the
[1:54:20] reward the benefit the peace the joy and
[1:54:25] you need the Holy Ghost you need to be
[1:54:27] Sanctified by the washing of the water
[1:54:29] of the word and you need to receive the
[1:54:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire and
[1:54:35] don't let anybody tell you that it's all
[1:54:37] just fanaticism it's real
[1:54:40] he is real and he's life-changing and
[1:54:44] and I I
[1:54:48] told the Lord on the way over here today
[1:54:51] it's I wasn't trying to make a bargain
[1:54:54] with the Lord
[1:54:55] but I said Lord
[1:54:57] I don't want to I don't want to live a
[1:55:01] life of of bad health and uh bad mind
[1:55:05] and not being able to take care of
[1:55:08] myself
[1:55:10] but if you will grant me
[1:55:12] some good years left on this Earth
[1:55:16] I will serve you with greater
[1:55:19] determination and I've served you before
[1:55:23] it's that real to me I don't think
[1:55:26] that the Earth can last like it is
[1:55:28] another 30 years
[1:55:30] but if I should live to be 85 to day 55.
[1:55:35] if I should live that long on this Earth
[1:55:38] I want every one of those days to count
[1:55:41] for Jesus Christ and I want to remind
[1:55:44] you even though you're young Maybe
[1:55:46] don't waste a year in sin and living for
[1:55:50] self
[1:55:51] give him everything you've got like I
[1:55:53] told him on the way over here Lord I
[1:55:55] want to serve you with greater fervor I
[1:55:58] want to do more for you than I've ever
[1:56:00] done and I want to sacrifice more for
[1:56:02] you than I ever have we feel that way
[1:56:04] because of The Nearness of his coming
[1:56:07] let me pray for you
[1:56:10] father I thank you today that you are
[1:56:13] God's Sovereign and supreme and I love
[1:56:17] you and I honor you today and I thank
[1:56:20] you for my son Joshua
[1:56:22] I thank you Lord for his desire to do a
[1:56:27] podcast and reach perhaps another
[1:56:29] audience than what you have let us reach
[1:56:33] before bless him and strengthen him
[1:56:37] and all of my family I lift them up to
[1:56:40] you and my church family and my friends
[1:56:43] those precious ones that are watching
[1:56:46] this podcast right now and I especially
[1:56:49] pray for those who may have had a good
[1:56:52] Heritage and who may have had parents or
[1:56:55] grandparents that served you but they
[1:56:58] have not yet made you Lord of all I pray
[1:57:01] for them right now I pray that the
[1:57:04] spirit of conviction would grip their
[1:57:07] heart
[1:57:08] that they would grow tired of their
[1:57:11] selfishness
[1:57:12] and that they would call on you for
[1:57:16] salvation
[1:57:18] to redeem them and to break every
[1:57:20] feather and every yoke in their life
[1:57:23] that they might serve you in the beauty
[1:57:26] of your righteousness and Holiness I
[1:57:29] pray for the addicted that you would
[1:57:33] come and sever them
[1:57:35] from their addiction make them free and
[1:57:40] make them whole to serve you and their
[1:57:44] families with joy
[1:57:46] fill with the Holy Ghost those who set
[1:57:50] themselves apart and desire to be filled
[1:57:54] Lord if there is someone who heard a
[1:57:57] little something about baptism
[1:58:00] and I've been baptized only in titles
[1:58:02] and not in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:58:05] Christ may they have courage right now
[1:58:07] may they be strengthened right now to
[1:58:10] make that choice
[1:58:11] and Lord provide somebody who will
[1:58:15] baptize them in the right way the name
[1:58:18] of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[1:58:21] remission of their sins I just pray for
[1:58:24] those who have heard something today
[1:58:26] that they may not be familiar with but
[1:58:29] if there's some truth there that you
[1:58:31] have laid aside for them make them
[1:58:34] hungry cause them to be like the bereans
[1:58:38] of old and dig it out and study it out
[1:58:42] and let you speak to them by your spirit
[1:58:46] and reveal yourself

[1:58:50] preaching the gospel of information
[1:58:53] but a gospel of Revelation and I ask you
[1:58:56] right now to let your truth be revealed
[1:58:59] to those who are hungry for it
[1:59:02] and we give you praise and honor and
