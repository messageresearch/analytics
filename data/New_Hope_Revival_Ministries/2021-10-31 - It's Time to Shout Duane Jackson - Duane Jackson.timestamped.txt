[36:02] to step out of my comfort zone
[36:06] into the realm of the unknown where
[36:09] jesus is
[36:12] and he's holding out his hand
[36:15] but the waves are calling out my name
[36:19] and they laugh at me
[36:22] they're reminding me of all
[36:26] i tried before it failed
[36:29] and the waves they keep on telling me
[36:32] time and time again boy you'll never win
[36:38] no you'll never win

[39:51] different story

[41:10] not a song that i would listen to at
[41:14] home
[41:15] it's not
[41:16] southern gospel so to me it's
[41:19] it's just not me
[41:21] but i want you to know those words
[41:24] are for me
[41:26] and they are for you
[41:28] and nobody sings it better than people
[41:31] like us
[41:32] and so we can take a song that doesn't
[41:35] sound quite like us
[41:37] and we can make it be more like us
[41:40] what we're used to
[41:42] and i appreciate that so much
[41:45] i
[41:45] every time we sing it i get this image
[41:48] in my mind
[41:50] of thousands of soldiers
[41:54] [Music]
[41:55] standing there as the lyrics say shaking
[41:58] in their armor
[42:02] wishing
[42:06] that they would have had the strength
[42:09] to stand
[42:11] i don't know how many of them could have
[42:14] been the ones
[42:17] would have liked to have been the one
[42:20] but there was one
[42:22] [Applause]
[42:24] we started out friday night by saying
[42:27] god wants to meet with somebody this
[42:28] weekend and we encourage the young
[42:31] people
[42:32] to go after that
[42:34] and to say if there's only one if only
[42:37] one has that meeting with the lord it's
[42:40] going to be me
[42:42] it takes a determination
[42:44] i just want to sing it again because it
[42:48] speaks to my heart
[42:50] because i know there are people who
[42:52] stand on the edges
[42:54] desiring to be the one
[42:57] desiring to take up the stone and take
[43:00] up the sling and slay the giant in their
[43:03] life once and for all
[43:08] there was a discussion at the table last
[43:10] night about the lyrics of a song with
[43:12] david
[43:13] that talks about
[43:14] how did it go david tell me
[43:18] we cut off the giant's head
[43:22] we eat giants for our bread
[43:25] and he
[43:26] he like me
[43:28] when you hear that the first time it's a
[43:30] little bit odd
[43:32] and it's based on a
[43:34] peculiar interpretation
[43:36] of a scripture
[43:38] but i want you to know something
[43:41] i also understand this morning the
[43:44] passion
[43:46] and the anger
[43:48] that can rise up in you in a holy manner
[43:52] when you recognize there's one giant
[43:54] standing between you and being yielded
[43:57] to the call of god on your life
[44:01] david may not have eaten goliath
[44:04] but i tell you what he did he put his
[44:07] head up on a pole
[44:08] way up high in the air and he said let
[44:11] everybody see this is what happens to
[44:14] those who defy the armies of the most
[44:18] high god
[44:20] and you'd better fear you'd better fear
[44:23] or your head may be the next head
[44:26] that's what he was saying
[44:28] so there's a part of me that says i
[44:31] understand that
[44:33] and i might just have a giant for
[44:35] breakfast
[44:37] we don't mean literally
[44:39] we mean figuratively
[44:42] i want that enemy in your life to be so
[44:46] ultimately dead
[44:48] that there is no way of recognizing
[44:52] his twisted torn mutilated carcass that
[44:56] lays on the battlefield of your life
[45:00] there is victory there is victory over
[45:04] every giant that races up to destroy you
[45:09] now i encourage you young people
[45:11] don't you be one of those soldiers
[45:16] standing looking on
[45:19] wishing that you would have had the
[45:22] courage
[45:23] to make a stand
[45:26] against that enemy that won't he listen
[45:29] he don't want to break you
[45:31] he wants to kill you
[45:34] he wants to eat you
[45:36] for breakfast
[45:38] and if you don't make that stand
[45:42] for that against that giant in your life
[45:44] nobody else can
[45:46] your pastor can't your parents can't
[45:49] your husband can't
[45:51] you've got to make a stand
[45:54] you've got to be willing to say i'm not
[45:56] going to be that one
[45:58] that stands there afraid
[46:01] i'm gonna be that little giant that
[46:03] little giant
[46:05] the one who was so small in stature
[46:08] ready in complexion
[46:10] who took on a battle
[46:12] that really wasn't his
[46:14] you see the battle belonged to the lord
[46:17] but david recognized i'm the one he's
[46:20] counting on
[46:22] we used to sing a song
[46:24] strange song brother duane years ago
[46:27] called paul's ministry did you ever hear
[46:29] that old song
[46:30] here's how the chorus went he said i
[46:32] counted on adam
[46:34] i counted on this one cane
[46:37] i counted on
[46:40] and i can't remember who now he was the
[46:42] same
[46:44] i counted on this one and he proved
[46:46] untrue
[46:47] you go tell the world paul
[46:50] i'm counting on you
[46:54] i feel like god's counting on some of us
[46:56] here this morning and we're not going to
[46:58] let him down
[47:01] i'll tell you i feel like flying
[47:03] if you see me go out across just don't
[47:05] be disturbed
[47:11] oh what i would do to have
[47:14] the kind of strength it takes to stand
[47:17] before a giant
[47:20] with just a sling and a stone
[47:24] surrounded by the sound of the thousand
[47:27] warriors just shaking in their armor
[47:32] and wishing they'd have had the strength
[47:35] to stand
[47:36] then the giant's calling out my name and
[47:40] he laughs at me
[47:42] he's just reminding me of all the times
[47:46] i've tried before in fail
[47:49] and the giant keeps on telling me
[47:53] time and time again
[47:55] boy
[47:56] you'll never win
[47:58] no

[48:58] warriors
[49:00] shaking in their armor
[49:04] and wishing they'd have had the strength
[49:06] to stare

[49:18] tried before in faith

[1:18:22] sing a little more that
[1:18:24] we're going to worship god
[1:18:29] the last time i was
[1:18:31] in there with
[1:18:32] hawk and r.j to see brother curry
[1:18:35] he was having a time but i
[1:18:38] i want you to know those
[1:18:41] arms begin to go right up in the air
[1:18:46] there's any singing going on
[1:18:49] his body responds to that worship into
[1:18:52] that atmosphere
[1:18:54] so let's send some of that anointing and
[1:18:56] some of this presence here let's send it
[1:18:59] through the stream
[1:19:01] and let's sing this one more time and
[1:19:03] worship the lord everyone who will your
[1:19:05] glorifying god
[1:19:07] but we're doing it to help create an
[1:19:09] atmosphere
[1:19:11] because they are holding on to hope
[1:19:14] and they're holding on to faith
[1:19:17] and they're believing
[1:19:19] they're believing
[1:19:20] and we're believing with them that god
[1:19:23] is sovereign and we know his perfect
[1:19:25] will is going to be done
[1:19:27] but there's nothing that causes us to
[1:19:29] feel defeated
[1:19:31] so if you don't feel defeated you might
[1:19:33] ought to just carry on
[1:19:35] praising him and decreeing faith and
[1:19:38] holding on to hope so one last time
[1:19:41] before we move on let's go through that
[1:19:42] singing and worship him
[1:19:45] and let us just create an atmosphere
[1:19:47] that we could sin to strengthen our
[1:19:49] brother and god is more than able more

[1:32:02] offering the church will also help
[1:32:04] brother
[1:32:05] dwayne because we want him to be blessed
[1:32:07] and we want them to know how much we
[1:32:09] appreciate the ministry that he has
[1:32:11] given us this weekend can i get a
[1:32:14] witness
[1:32:16] from the testimony at the banquet
[1:32:19] until the service last night you may be
[1:32:22] seated you're tired i
[1:32:24] know to the service last night
[1:32:29] to just his presence here this morning
[1:32:33] we're not
[1:32:34] used to through the years we've had some
[1:32:37] wonderful brothers
[1:32:39] but you know everybody has a different
[1:32:40] way about them and some people are not
[1:32:43] worshipers by nature
[1:32:45] we're so blessed to have a preacher
[1:32:48] who's a worshiper
[1:32:51] who doesn't just sit back and watch us
[1:32:53] worship he'd be he'd be sitting back a
[1:32:55] long time watching it
[1:32:57] but he enters in
[1:33:00] and i don't know if you know it or not
[1:33:02] but because you believe in worship
[1:33:04] subconsciously you give him more
[1:33:06] attention
[1:33:07] when he gets up here to bring the word
[1:33:10] because you can see that he participates
[1:33:13] in what he's saying
[1:33:15] and i appreciate it so much i didn't go
[1:33:18] down
[1:33:19] back there last night to forsake you i
[1:33:21] did it because i can be distracting to
[1:33:23] other people
[1:33:24] and so i went to the back
[1:33:27] because i wanted every young person
[1:33:30] to be able to have their attention on
[1:33:33] what was being said
[1:33:35] and a foundation was being laid and laid
[1:33:37] and laid i'm telling you what it was
[1:33:39] something else
[1:33:40] the sound of those wooden rulers
[1:33:43] breaking around the altar last night was
[1:33:46] powerful
[1:33:48] and when i got home to my house we were
[1:33:50] still trying to unplug lights and do
[1:33:52] things so we were the last last vehicle
[1:33:55] to get out of here not to get out of
[1:33:56] here but to get home some were still
[1:33:59] talking in the parking lot and when i
[1:34:01] walked in there was already a testimony
[1:34:03] service going on
[1:34:04] and testimonies were already being
[1:34:06] shared of what the lord had done in the
[1:34:08] service last night
[1:34:10] we discovered something we discovered
[1:34:13] that
[1:34:14] some people like like hunter for
[1:34:16] instance and and maybe he'll give his
[1:34:18] testimony tuesday night of what he feels
[1:34:21] like the lord did for him
[1:34:23] but but he's like me
[1:34:25] he he was so moved by what happened in
[1:34:28] the breaking of that ruler that he stuck
[1:34:31] that those pieces in his pocket
[1:34:34] and he plans to hold on to them that's
[1:34:36] just like me
[1:34:38] and when he sees them he's going to
[1:34:40] remember
[1:34:41] that thing
[1:34:43] has no hold on me
[1:34:49] why are you grinning
[1:34:52] uh
[1:34:53] some people like benjamin are more like
[1:34:55] their mother
[1:34:58] in this regard
[1:35:00] and that is when they got done with
[1:35:03] their ruler pieces brother dwayne i
[1:35:05] should be telling you
[1:35:06] they throw them in the trash
[1:35:08] because they didn't ever want to see
[1:35:10] them again
[1:35:12] and when i woke up this morning
[1:35:14] i said to myself they're both right
[1:35:19] to the one who needs a memorial
[1:35:21] hunter's got a memorial
[1:35:24] to the ones who don't ever want to have
[1:35:25] to ever see or think about that stuff
[1:35:27] again it went out in the trash
[1:35:32] and there was just one problem and that
[1:35:34] was jenna wanted benjamin to keep hers
[1:35:37] where is she
[1:35:38] and he didn't
[1:35:41] so i went out this morning and tried to
[1:35:43] find them in the trash but that those
[1:35:45] bags were already gone so i had to come
[1:35:47] back so whether whether she meant it or
[1:35:50] not you're never going to see them again
[1:35:52] it's gone
[1:35:54] i am so thankful for what the lord
[1:35:56] accomplished
[1:35:57] for the streamers
[1:35:59] testimonies began to come in during the
[1:36:02] service last night
[1:36:04] of what god was doing for streamers and
[1:36:06] how he was speaking to their hearts from
[1:36:08] the message that was going forth so the
[1:36:11] ministry that brother jackson has
[1:36:13] brought to us this weekend has gone out
[1:36:15] beyond the church i want to thank god
[1:36:18] that others have been able to benefit
[1:36:22] from his ministry
[1:36:26] and we believe that a laborer is worthy
[1:36:29] of his hire and that's all that we need
[1:36:31] to say i want you to ask the lord even
[1:36:34] now what he would have you to give every
[1:36:37] single penny
[1:36:39] every dollar every check every bit of
[1:36:42] this will go to brother jackson and we
[1:36:45] will also uh give him an offering from
[1:36:48] the church from the from the ministry
[1:36:51] here but i want them to be blessed don't
[1:36:54] you
[1:36:55] so would you get that together right now
[1:36:57] and let's come and
[1:36:59] prepare to bless the man of god and
[1:37:03] he'll be coming in just a moment to
[1:37:04] preach i don't want you to rush him
[1:37:08] i want us to get all we can get out of
[1:37:11] them because he's getting more
[1:37:13] invitations now and it may be harder to
[1:37:16] book him in the future
[1:37:17] so we want to get all we can out of him
[1:37:20] while he's here amen
[1:37:22] one more time while you're getting your
[1:37:24] check together or cash together or
[1:37:26] whatever you're doing i want to thank
[1:37:28] every person who has worked hard for our
[1:37:32] young people this week they appreciate
[1:37:34] it i want you to know that i want you to
[1:37:37] know sister laurel my wife
[1:37:40] these uh girls who did so much with the

[1:37:53] have made such an effort to make it very
[1:37:56] very special
[1:37:57] and we thank you for that and we thank
[1:38:00] those of you who prayed that god would
[1:38:02] show up he did
[1:38:04] so no matter what you've done brother my
[1:38:06] wife wanted to mention that brother
[1:38:08] greeley's heater came through we didn't

[1:38:12] way it did and we were able to stay
[1:38:15] warmer than we would have

[1:38:31] twisted around and set on the ground and
[1:38:34] plastic
[1:38:35] connectors began to pop well they didn't

[1:47:24] would you help the lord's lord to get
[1:47:26] out of the way each and every one of us

[1:47:37] to speak what you would have to be said
[1:47:40] lord i don't want any of my thoughts to

[1:47:49] thank you for it lord
[1:47:51] amen
[1:47:52] hallelujah hallelujah i tell you what a
[1:47:55] time
[1:47:56] of praise that we have had this morning
[1:47:58] you know and maybe some people look at
[1:48:00] it brother steve and
[1:48:02] you know we were talking last night at
[1:48:04] how some might might look they may
[1:48:06] stream the the service and and looking
[1:48:09] for something to critique and
[1:48:11] and they say well
[1:48:13] um this is how it's been said at our
[1:48:14] church before i'll put it this way um
[1:48:16] brother brother dan daisley used to say
[1:48:18] when somebody come and visit or
[1:48:19] something they would watch the service
[1:48:21] they're like well that's not how we do
[1:48:23] it at our church
[1:48:24] and he said well you're not at your
[1:48:25] church
[1:48:27] you're at our church
[1:48:28] so enter in and worship
[1:48:31] and uh and that's how that's how i
[1:48:32] believe we're not um
[1:48:34] we're not it's not here for a show
[1:48:37] i don't believe any of you here are here
[1:48:39] for a show this morning
[1:48:41] i believe that you're here to enter into
[1:48:42] worship because you have a need i come
[1:48:45] with a need this morning
[1:48:47] i hope that you've come and you're
[1:48:48] laying your need before him and we
[1:48:51] worship we bring him on the scene and he
[1:48:53] comes to meet every single need that we
[1:48:55] have you know i think some people get
[1:48:57] caught up in that um we've read at the
[1:48:59] maybe last night the book of ephesians
[1:49:01] and it says putting on the whole armor
[1:49:03] of god that was in the songs they were
[1:49:05] singing it says to having done all to
[1:49:08] stand yes sir
[1:49:10] but i think some people misinterpret
[1:49:11] that brother steve
[1:49:14] they said
[1:49:16] i've done everything
[1:49:18] i've done it all
[1:49:23] and i'm going to be dignified and
[1:49:27] i'm going to come to church and i'm
[1:49:28] going to stand
[1:49:31] because my bible says to stand therefore
[1:49:35] so they uh well i didn't i'm talking
[1:49:37] about people at my church
[1:49:39] that that have that have done that
[1:49:41] before and then they kind of just stand
[1:49:43] there
[1:49:44] and nothing you say is going to move me
[1:49:47] and nothing you say is going to change
[1:49:50] my opinion and change what i think and
[1:49:53] what i do because my bibles told me i
[1:49:56] could just stand
[1:49:58] so i'm going to stand
[1:50:00] that's not what it's about
[1:50:02] they're going to stand in the way it's
[1:50:03] what they're going to do and that's not
[1:50:04] what it's about
[1:50:06] you know i was listening a few weeks ago
[1:50:08] y'all be seated for just a minute
[1:50:10] i'll forget that you're standing and
[1:50:11] you'll stand as long as as as i am um
[1:50:15] but i guess it'd be all right i mean
[1:50:16] that'd be all
[1:50:18] y'all forgive me
[1:50:20] i don't know how these these uh brothers
[1:50:22] can sing and do all that for so long and
[1:50:26] oh they're they can go yes thank you so
[1:50:28] much
[1:50:29] i'm sorry i i forget about those
[1:50:33] formalities and
[1:50:34] at our church once somebody just stands
[1:50:36] up they just leave
[1:50:38] they just leave sometimes um but you
[1:50:40] know i i believe that um
[1:50:43] some people have taken that the wrong
[1:50:45] way and and they they look at it from
[1:50:47] that you know i'm just gonna i'm
[1:50:49] standing
[1:50:50] i'm doing what the bible says i'm just
[1:50:51] standing
[1:50:53] and and that's not what it's about now i
[1:50:54] was just as i was starting to say i was
[1:50:57] cutting my grass several weeks back and
[1:50:59] and listening to uh one of brother
[1:51:00] brandon's messages and he got telling
[1:51:02] the story of a time that he was he was
[1:51:05] up and i forgot where he was at maybe up
[1:51:06] in canada and he was trying to to to get
[1:51:08] close enough to a bear that he could
[1:51:10] take a picture of it and um and he got
[1:51:13] into an area and it was it was overcast
[1:51:15] and and dark and the clouds was there
[1:51:17] and um he got into this little area and
[1:51:20] uh he sat sit down there for a minute
[1:51:24] and as he was
[1:51:25] sitting there in the quiet he started
[1:51:27] hearing creaking sounds
[1:51:30] it was like a moaning sound
[1:51:32] and he didn't know what it was and it
[1:51:34] was it was kind of disconcerting you
[1:51:36] know what what's going on why am i
[1:51:38] hearing these sounds he said it was kind
[1:51:40] of if you listen to the message he said
[1:51:41] it felt kind of a spooky place
[1:51:44] and um
[1:51:45] he says and then whenever the the clouds
[1:51:47] moved out of the way and the the moon
[1:51:49] shone through he saw these
[1:51:51] old dead trees that was standing there
[1:51:54] and as the wind was trying to move those
[1:51:56] dead trees
[1:51:57] it sounded spooky they would creak
[1:52:00] and i think too many times there's too
[1:52:02] many dead trees
[1:52:05] [Music]
[1:52:07] he said they look like tombstones is
[1:52:09] what
[1:52:10] it's what what he said they look like
[1:52:12] big tombstones up there and i think
[1:52:14] sometimes people get uh get set in their
[1:52:17] ways
[1:52:18] and um they they become those uh those
[1:52:20] tombstones that's just standing and the
[1:52:22] wind of the holy spirit moves through
[1:52:25] and it tries to move them and they just
[1:52:27] stand stiff
[1:52:29] and you're not going to move me bless
[1:52:31] god i'm going to stand right here
[1:52:33] and that's not what we're supposed to do
[1:52:35] but he said he looked and he saw some
[1:52:37] young tender undergrowth
[1:52:40] and as that same breeze
[1:52:42] blew through there that young
[1:52:44] undergrowth
[1:52:45] he said it was just swaying in the wind
[1:52:49] it was just swaying in the wind while
[1:52:51] there's big dead trees that stood there
[1:52:53] they've been there forever and they
[1:52:55] stood there and they just stood stiff
[1:52:57] and they moaned and groaned
[1:52:59] but that young tender undergrowth as the
[1:53:02] wind of the holy ghost would come
[1:53:03] through
[1:53:04] they would just sway and they would sway
[1:53:08] it was the same wind
[1:53:10] but it affected different people
[1:53:12] different ways
[1:53:14] in in 19 this isn't part of my message
[1:53:16] but this was just something that was
[1:53:17] good so i had to write it down um in in
[1:53:20] 1957
[1:53:22] um brother branham it was preaching a
[1:53:25] message why some people can't keep the
[1:53:27] victory
[1:53:28] didn't say that they didn't had not had
[1:53:30] the victory but why they can't keep the
[1:53:32] victory and he says we need a holy ghost
[1:53:35] experience in the church of the living
[1:53:38] god
[1:53:39] you know that is true
[1:53:41] we need to be greened up
[1:53:44] livened up
[1:53:46] if life makes you act green
[1:53:49] then go ahead and get life
[1:53:52] that's right
[1:53:53] and that's what we need this morning we
[1:53:55] need to get life if that's what it's
[1:53:57] going to take to get us greened up and
[1:53:59] swaying in the wind and moving that's
[1:54:02] what we want to do this morning
[1:54:04] amen amen i take well sermon number one
[1:54:09] that one's a short one we'll get that
[1:54:10] one out of the way
[1:54:13] how many come expecting this morning
[1:54:16] i didn't know we had that many pregnant
[1:54:18] people here
[1:54:20] we are
[1:54:23] he got it
[1:54:25] he got it see when some people say
[1:54:28] i'm expecting
[1:54:30] that means they're with child
[1:54:33] and there's a thing about being
[1:54:34] expecting
[1:54:36] it makes you act different
[1:54:38] it makes you walk different
[1:54:41] it changes your appetite many times you
[1:54:44] have different desires for different
[1:54:46] things to feed on
[1:54:47] so if you've really come expecting this
[1:54:50] morning and you have him
[1:54:53] growing inside of you it will change the
[1:54:55] way you walk
[1:54:57] it will change the way you know when
[1:54:59] when a when a sister becomes expecting
[1:55:02] she has to change her attire she does
[1:55:05] she has to dress according to that
[1:55:07] because it changes her and she has to
[1:55:10] get different clothes well sometimes
[1:55:12] that's what needs to happen to us
[1:55:14] sometimes if you have him dwelling
[1:55:16] inside of you it's gonna it's gonna show
[1:55:18] up on the outside too
[1:55:20] and it will show up in how how we dress
[1:55:23] and we need to dress appropriately of
[1:55:25] being showing this world that we are
[1:55:28] expecting we are with child of the holy
[1:55:31] spirit and that is what's growing inside
[1:55:33] of us this morning
[1:55:35] hallelujah hallelujah could you stand
[1:55:38] with me
[1:55:41] and we'll read as i told you um
[1:55:45] they've already uh they've already
[1:55:46] preached my message for me this morning
[1:55:49] after listening to the the special last
[1:55:51] night
[1:55:52] um i was struggling i had
[1:55:54] um
[1:55:56] struggling between a couple thoughts and
[1:55:59] that the lord had laid on my heart and
[1:56:00] uh i was really kind of battling my mind
[1:56:03] as we we came down as to the direction
[1:56:05] that that i was supposed to go this
[1:56:08] morning and i felt in my heart that that
[1:56:11] that this was the right way and in the
[1:56:13] group saying last night and immediately
[1:56:16] i'm like well
[1:56:17] thank you lord that's my confirmation
[1:56:19] that's my confirmation and then the
[1:56:21] other songs that was sung last night
[1:56:23] tied right into
[1:56:24] what i was talking about and breaking
[1:56:26] the rules and having a breakthrough and
[1:56:27] and i'm just i i feel so blessed that
[1:56:30] god would come down and speak to me see
[1:56:32] that wasn't for you
[1:56:34] that was for me that he came down and
[1:56:36] spoke that to me
[1:56:38] and
[1:56:39] in in psalms 100
[1:56:41] in verse 4. i'll read verse 4 and then
[1:56:43] let you have your seats and then we'll
[1:56:45] uh maybe we'll read a few more verses

[1:57:32] verses one through five
[1:57:34] um of this of psalms 100 says make a
[1:57:37] joyful noise
[1:57:39] unto the lord all ye lands
[1:57:42] serve the lord with gladness
[1:57:45] come before his presence with singing
[1:57:48] that's what we've done this morning
[1:57:50] know ye
[1:57:51] that the lord he is god
[1:57:54] it is he
[1:57:55] that hath made us and not we ourselves
[1:57:59] we are his people
[1:58:02] and the sheep of his pasture
[1:58:05] enter into his gates with thanksgiving
[1:58:07] that means hands raised
[1:58:10] and into his courts with praise which is
[1:58:12] singing be thankful unto him and bless
[1:58:15] his name for the lord is good his mercy
[1:58:20] is everlasting and his truth endureth to
[1:58:25] all
[1:58:26] generations the the songs that were sung
[1:58:29] this morning to your family into their
[1:58:31] children and to their children and to
[1:58:34] their children and i was as the song was
[1:58:36] going on in my mind i'm thinking y'all
[1:58:38] are preaching my message
[1:58:40] you're singing my message this morning
[1:58:42] because
[1:58:44] the lord is good and his mercy is
[1:58:46] everlasting and his truth endureth to
[1:58:49] all
[1:58:50] generations
[1:58:52] if you look back in verse three
[1:58:54] there's there's three words in verse
[1:58:56] three that just really when i when i was
[1:58:58] studying this and i came across this
[1:59:00] part it just really struck me brother
[1:59:03] steve it says we
[1:59:05] are his
[1:59:07] it says we are his people but the three
[1:59:09] words we
[1:59:11] are his
[1:59:12] i was like
[1:59:14] my
[1:59:15] that's enough to stop and just rejoice
[1:59:17] for ages and ages to know
[1:59:19] that he claims me
[1:59:21] to know that i am his and if i'm his he
[1:59:24] is mine
[1:59:26] and i just i got so excited just to just
[1:59:28] to read that we
[1:59:31] are his and i just i felt that was just
[1:59:33] a reason to worship it was a reason to
[1:59:36] praise
[1:59:37] it was a reason for us to get a little
[1:59:40] bit loud this morning i think some
[1:59:42] people may get a little frightened by
[1:59:43] that i don't think this church does but
[1:59:45] i know of other churches that do they
[1:59:47] get a little frightened when people get
[1:59:48] a little loud and they're like oh you
[1:59:50] got to look at church order and you got
[1:59:53] to do this and you got to do that well i
[1:59:54] think brother sometimes brother brother
[1:59:56] branham would say it's maybe we need to
[1:59:58] get a little bit out of order
[2:00:00] so we can get into him you know we get
[2:00:02] stuck in our own ways and in our
[2:00:04] traditions and those type things we need
[2:00:06] to get a little out of order sometimes
[2:00:08] to to be yielded to him to what he wants
[2:00:10] us to do and enter into his presence
[2:00:13] this morning
[2:00:14] but to know that we are his which that
[2:00:17] tells me i am his
[2:00:20] by creation
[2:00:22] because he created me
[2:00:23] i am his by creation i am his
[2:00:27] by redemption
[2:00:29] [Music]
[2:00:31] god looks at you and says you're twice
[2:00:33] mine
[2:00:34] because i made you i created you
[2:00:37] and then i redeemed you so now you are
[2:00:40] twice mine
[2:00:42] by rights we belong to him
[2:00:45] but he wants you to make that choice
[2:00:48] to belong back to him he wants you to
[2:00:50] make that personal choice that you're
[2:00:52] going to receive him
[2:00:54] as who he is and he that and understand
[2:00:57] that his desire is to fill your life
[2:01:00] completely and to me that is a reason to
[2:01:03] shout and that's my title this morning
[2:01:06] it's time to shout wow
[2:01:08] it's time to shout
[2:01:10] out
[2:01:11] and as i said
[2:01:15] you have preached my message for me this
[2:01:18] morning so all i'm gonna do is just
[2:01:20] gonna just come in and give you the word
[2:01:22] to back up everything that you've
[2:01:23] already been singing everything that
[2:01:25] you've already been doing this morning
[2:01:26] in psalm 47 verse 1 it says oh clap your
[2:01:30] hands
[2:01:31] all ye people
[2:01:35] shout unto
[2:01:37] god
[2:01:38] with the voice of triumph
[2:01:42] hallelujah we praise your wonderful name
[2:01:44] lord
[2:01:46] hallelujah
[2:01:48] you know we're not we're not shouting at
[2:01:50] god
[2:01:52] we're not angry at god we're not
[2:01:54] shouting at god we're shouting unto him
[2:01:58] we are lifting our praise to him we are
[2:02:01] lifting our adoration to him our worship
[2:02:04] to him we're not angry with god
[2:02:07] we love him and we want him to
[2:02:10] to receive our love that we can express
[2:02:13] because there's so many things that he
[2:02:14] can do for you that you can't do back
[2:02:16] for him
[2:02:17] all we can do is give him our praise
[2:02:19] we can give him our worship this morning
[2:02:22] you know the word shout that's used
[2:02:23] there as i was looking it up i like to
[2:02:26] look up definitions of things and it
[2:02:29] actually meant
[2:02:30] make a joyful noise which we know that
[2:02:33] split the ears
[2:02:35] with sound
[2:02:37] that's pretty loud
[2:02:39] to split the ears with sound
[2:02:42] that is a loud noise that is a loud
[2:02:46] shout
[2:02:47] in the book of luke
[2:02:49] 19
[2:02:51] and people want to be quiet in church
[2:02:52] well they're not reading the same bible
[2:02:54] that i'm reading
[2:02:55] they're not reading it luke chapter 19
[2:02:59] verses 36 through 40
[2:03:01] it says and as he went
[2:03:04] they spread their clothes in the way
[2:03:07] and when he was come nigh even now at
[2:03:09] the descent of the mount of olives the
[2:03:11] whole multitude the whole multitude
[2:03:16] it wasn't just one or two out of a group
[2:03:18] but it was the entire multitude of the
[2:03:21] disciples began to rejoice
[2:03:23] and praise god with a loud voice
[2:03:28] for all the mighty works that they had
[2:03:31] seen saying blessed be the king
[2:03:35] that cometh in the name of the lord
[2:03:37] peace in heaven and glory in the highest
[2:03:42] they weren't being quiet
[2:03:44] they were not being quiet they were not
[2:03:46] saying well blessed be the name
[2:03:48] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:03:52] blessed be the name of the lord no
[2:03:56] that was not how they were being
[2:03:59] blessed is the king
[2:04:01] that cometh they had a message that they
[2:04:04] were wanting to tell people there's a
[2:04:06] king that's coming you may not know him
[2:04:08] but i know him and i want you to know
[2:04:11] him how i know him blessed is the king
[2:04:14] that cometh in the name of the lord
[2:04:16] peace in heaven and glory in the highest
[2:04:20] and some of the pharisees from among the
[2:04:22] multitudes said unto him master
[2:04:25] rebuke thy disciples
[2:04:28] tell them to hush up this is not church
[2:04:31] order this is not how we do it in our
[2:04:33] church in our assembly and he answered
[2:04:36] and said unto them i tell you that
[2:04:40] if these should hold their peace
[2:04:43] i'll put it this way if you were to hold
[2:04:46] your peace
[2:04:47] the stones
[2:04:49] would immediately cry out
[2:04:51] there is going to be a praise for my god
[2:04:55] i want that praise to come from me
[2:04:58] i'm not going to wait for you to praise
[2:05:01] him i'm going to praise him
[2:05:03] i'm going to worship him
[2:05:05] because i love him
[2:05:08] and he loves me
[2:05:10] and he's told me that i am his
[2:05:13] [Music]
[2:05:14] i am his
[2:05:16] what more do you need
[2:05:18] to know that i'm his
[2:05:21] i don't need anything more you could
[2:05:23] close the book up and put everything
[2:05:25] else aside but i know that he told me
[2:05:28] you're mine
[2:05:30] you're mine
[2:05:32] and i'll do anything and i have done
[2:05:34] everything
[2:05:36] to bring you back to me
[2:05:38] because that's where i want you
[2:05:40] he wants you
[2:05:42] right by his side
[2:05:44] he he offers to you in the scripture he
[2:05:46] says take my yoke
[2:05:49] upon you
[2:05:51] okay a yoke
[2:05:53] com it joins two people or two animals
[2:05:56] in the scripture now
[2:05:58] he would never have offered to you
[2:06:01] jesus would never have offered to you
[2:06:03] to take a portion of his yoke upon you
[2:06:07] if you were not equally
[2:06:10] yoked with him because he knew the
[2:06:12] scripture that you're not supposed to be
[2:06:14] unequally yoked
[2:06:16] so he's not going to stand there and
[2:06:18] offer you to stand by his side
[2:06:21] and join that yoke with him unless
[2:06:24] you're equal with him
[2:06:26] the only way you're going to be equal
[2:06:27] with him is that you have to have him
[2:06:30] living inside of you
[2:06:31] he has imparted a part of himself to you
[2:06:34] so you have the right to stand by his oh
[2:06:37] glory to god to stand by his side
[2:06:42] i know
[2:06:43] that i am his
[2:06:45] i know he invited he invited moses to
[2:06:48] stand in the cliff
[2:06:50] he said come come here moses
[2:06:53] stand by my side
[2:06:55] on this
[2:06:56] rock he didn't tell moses to get away
[2:06:59] from him
[2:07:00] he invited moses to stand beside him
[2:07:03] he made a place for him in the cleft of
[2:07:06] the rock he's made his place for you in
[2:07:08] the cleft of the rock
[2:07:10] and he has invited you he says come
[2:07:12] stand beside my side stand right here oh
[2:07:16] my why would you want to go anywhere
[2:07:18] else whenever you have an opportunity to
[2:07:19] stand beside jesus
[2:07:21] because whenever you know that you're
[2:07:23] beside him all your worries are gone
[2:07:26] all your problems have been taken care
[2:07:28] of
[2:07:30] i can't get over the fact just the three
[2:07:33] simple words
[2:07:34] we are his
[2:07:36] if you can ever get that revelation
[2:07:38] if you can ever grasp a hold of that
[2:07:40] that he has made claim to you
[2:07:43] and if he's made claim to you he will
[2:07:44] not lose you
[2:07:45] he will not lose you
[2:07:47] i don't care what the situation is i
[2:07:49] don't care what the problem is we talked
[2:07:51] last night about all the different
[2:07:52] things that satan was trying to bind you
[2:07:54] up in but all that was broken last night
[2:07:58] all of that's behind us it's it's in our
[2:08:00] past we don't look back to that no more
[2:08:03] we're looking forward to what god has
[2:08:04] for us right now
[2:08:06] there needs to be a noise of praise in
[2:08:09] the camp and that noise needs to be
[2:08:11] saying jesus is coming
[2:08:15] jesus is coming that's what they were
[2:08:18] that's what those disciples were saying
[2:08:20] people may not even knew who jesus was
[2:08:24] you got to think about that we look at
[2:08:25] it from our perspective we're reading
[2:08:27] the bible so we knew what they were
[2:08:28] talking about there were many there had
[2:08:30] no clue who he was
[2:08:32] what does that even matter who's who's
[2:08:34] jesus who's jesus you need to meet my
[2:08:37] jesus
[2:08:38] that's what they were trying to tell
[2:08:40] them jesus is coming the king of glory
[2:08:43] is among us and you need to meet him
[2:08:47] hallelujah
[2:08:49] praise his name
[2:08:51] in ecclesiastes three and seven it says
[2:08:54] there's a time to rend
[2:08:55] a time to sow
[2:08:57] a time to keep silence
[2:08:59] and too many people have stayed right
[2:09:01] there
[2:09:04] they got stuck in that verse there's a
[2:09:06] time to keep silence
[2:09:08] and there's a time to speak
[2:09:11] we're in that time to speak
[2:09:15] they they sung the song oh my goodness
[2:09:20] they were singing that song last night
[2:09:22] and i couldn't help myself i just i was
[2:09:24] just getting so overjoyed because i i
[2:09:27] didn't share with you what brother steve
[2:09:29] never once asked me what what's uh you
[2:09:31] know what's the lord giving to you
[2:09:32] what's what's on the plate for us i
[2:09:34] haven't spoken to anybody here the only
[2:09:36] person that knew
[2:09:38] potentially what i was going to talk
[2:09:39] about this morning was sister heather
[2:09:42] and i don't think she went and talked to
[2:09:43] the people that was going to be singing
[2:09:45] and said you know what y'all need to
[2:09:47] sing a song that that would fit with
[2:09:49] that no
[2:09:50] that was divinely orchestrated by god
[2:09:54] because he knew the struggle i was
[2:09:56] having inside of me
[2:09:58] but he knew what you needed this morning
[2:10:01] he knows what we have need of at every
[2:10:04] single moment and he will give you the
[2:10:06] words to speak if he says there is a
[2:10:08] time to speak
[2:10:09] he will give you the words to speak in
[2:10:12] the appropriate time
[2:10:14] he will place as i said i think maybe
[2:10:15] last night or things last night um that
[2:10:19] that he will place his words
[2:10:22] in your mouth because he does not want
[2:10:25] you speaking what you think
[2:10:28] god does not need what you think he does
[2:10:30] not need what i think he does not need
[2:10:32] my opinion on the matter all he needs is
[2:10:35] his word it is written he needs his word
[2:10:39] spoken forth and that's what's going to
[2:10:42] defeat the enemy every place every time
[2:10:46] but we have to be obedient
[2:10:48] we have to be obedient to speak at his
[2:10:51] command
[2:10:53] because sometimes he comes in and he's
[2:10:55] he's desiring you to speak
[2:10:57] he he gives you a word
[2:10:59] in your heart in your mind to speak
[2:11:02] maybe to speak to someone to speak
[2:11:04] before the church and you squelch it
[2:11:07] and you dampen it you're like oh i think
[2:11:08] that was just me they're just going to
[2:11:10] think that that was my opinion on that
[2:11:13] no if he gave you the word to speak it
[2:11:15] needs to be spoken
[2:11:16] it needs to be done in order but it
[2:11:18] needs to be spoken
[2:11:20] if he places his word in you it needs to
[2:11:23] be spoken
[2:11:25] we have to say what he has said we have
[2:11:28] to speak at his command
[2:11:31] i think this has already been said this
[2:11:32] morning too
[2:11:34] our worship
[2:11:35] our worship draws us closer
[2:11:38] to christ
[2:11:39] [Music]
[2:11:41] if you don't know that
[2:11:43] you shouldn't know it by now
[2:11:44] our worship draws us closer to him our
[2:11:47] praise
[2:11:49] lifts him up in adoration
[2:11:52] and i i got to thinking one day i
[2:11:54] i do a lot of my thinking when i'm
[2:11:56] cutting grass so i listen to the
[2:11:58] messages or i listen to the bible and so
[2:12:01] the lord deals with me many times i'll
[2:12:03] be out cutting grass we got about eight
[2:12:05] acres to to cut between my place and my
[2:12:08] dad's place and so i can just be out
[2:12:10] there for a few hours and just listen
[2:12:12] it's my alone time
[2:12:13] and um
[2:12:14] it started raining
[2:12:16] while i was out there and that's one
[2:12:17] thing you don't want to do while you're
[2:12:19] trying to cut grass because then you get
[2:12:21] in a place of well if i don't finish it
[2:12:23] now
[2:12:25] it's going to look terrible because i
[2:12:26] got half of the yard done
[2:12:29] you know so i or if i'm going to have to
[2:12:31] try to come back later and wait for the
[2:12:32] grass to dry out but i was i was cutting
[2:12:35] grass and
[2:12:36] it started
[2:12:37] raining a little bit
[2:12:40] and as i
[2:12:41] looked up watching it rain
[2:12:43] and it it came to me
[2:12:46] that most of the time we say the
[2:12:48] the rain we see the rain falling down
[2:12:52] the rain is falling
[2:12:54] down
[2:12:55] well actually
[2:12:56] the rain is not falling
[2:12:59] the rain is being
[2:13:00] pulled down
[2:13:02] because of gravity right
[2:13:05] gravity is what draws it down
[2:13:08] to the earth so it didn't just fall
[2:13:10] it was a purpose and the gravity is what
[2:13:13] drew it down to earth and what i started
[2:13:17] thinking about
[2:13:18] is that
[2:13:20] our praise
[2:13:22] our worship
[2:13:24] is that gravity
[2:13:26] that draws god
[2:13:29] on the scene
[2:13:31] if you have a need and you start
[2:13:33] worshiping
[2:13:34] you start praising you start praying you
[2:13:38] start lifting his name on high
[2:13:40] he shows up
[2:13:42] he didn't just fall there
[2:13:45] but it was a it was drawn there
[2:13:48] the the need that you have
[2:13:51] you know there's so many people
[2:13:53] that are needy people
[2:13:55] and sometimes
[2:13:56] if you know of of a person that's a
[2:13:59] needy person you might try not to be
[2:14:01] around them that much because it seems
[2:14:03] like every time i'm around them they
[2:14:05] they need me to do this they need me to
[2:14:06] do that they need this need that need
[2:14:08] need need
[2:14:09] and there's people that are that way
[2:14:11] some people are givers they're all all
[2:14:13] the time give give give give
[2:14:16] but see when god looks at it
[2:14:19] and he sees a needy person
[2:14:22] it's attractive to him
[2:14:23] [Music]
[2:14:25] your need
[2:14:27] is what makes you attractive
[2:14:30] to god
[2:14:31] to other people your need might be a
[2:14:34] distraction it might push them off but
[2:14:37] god don't see it that way
[2:14:39] he looks at you and he says
[2:14:41] oh
[2:14:42] there's a need there
[2:14:44] and i've expressed my need to him
[2:14:47] and he says
[2:14:49] i can go and take care of that
[2:14:51] because i have what they need
[2:14:54] i am what they need
[2:14:57] and he comes your need is what draws him
[2:15:00] on the scene
[2:15:02] but there's there's steps you need to
[2:15:04] worship him
[2:15:05] you need to praise him
[2:15:06] you need to pray to him you need to lift
[2:15:08] his name in adoration and that calls him
[2:15:12] on the scene
[2:15:13] every single time and whenever you're in
[2:15:15] his presence what does the bible say in
[2:15:17] his presence there is fullness of joy
[2:15:21] our shout brings a deliverance to our
[2:15:25] situation
[2:15:27] now
[2:15:28] see this was going to be my my big part
[2:15:30] of the the message and they've already
[2:15:31] took my thunder brother steve because of
[2:15:33] the song they sung
[2:15:35] i'm partly to blame because i asked him
[2:15:37] to sing it this morning but after
[2:15:39] hearing it last night i just i had to so
[2:15:42] um
[2:15:43] so if you will allow me i'd like to read
[2:15:45] to you the story of jericho
[2:15:48] out of joshua chapter 6 verses 1 through
[2:15:52] 20
[2:15:53] and
[2:15:54] read that for you right quick and just
[2:15:56] do a little a little bible lesson now
[2:15:58] jericho
[2:15:59] was straightly shut up because of the
[2:16:02] children of israel none went out and
[2:16:05] none came in
[2:16:06] and the lord said unto joshua see
[2:16:09] i have given into thine hand jericho
[2:16:12] and the king thereof and the mighty men
[2:16:14] of valor
[2:16:15] and ye shall compass the city all ye men
[2:16:19] of war
[2:16:20] and go round about the city once keep in
[2:16:23] mind it was men of war
[2:16:25] we'll come back to that in a minute go
[2:16:27] around about the city once thus shalt
[2:16:30] thou do six days and seven priests shall
[2:16:33] bear before the ark seven trumpets of
[2:16:35] ram's horns
[2:16:36] so thankful brother greeley picked up
[2:16:38] that horn this morning and was blowing
[2:16:40] the trumpet i'm like well we're gonna
[2:16:42] need that here in a little while
[2:16:43] and when you hear the sound of the
[2:16:45] trumpet and all the people shall
[2:16:48] shout
[2:16:49] with a great shout i think i've skipped
[2:16:51] down into verse 5. shout with a great
[2:16:54] shout and the wall of the city shall
[2:16:56] fall flat down flat and the people shall
[2:16:59] ascend up every man straight before him
[2:17:02] and joshua the son of done called the
[2:17:04] priest and said unto them take up the
[2:17:06] ark of the covenant and let seven
[2:17:08] priests bear seven trumpets of ram's
[2:17:11] horns before the ark of the lord
[2:17:13] and he said unto the people pass on and
[2:17:14] come past the city and let him that is
[2:17:17] armed pass on before the ark of the lord
[2:17:19] and it came to pass when joshua had
[2:17:21] spoken unto the people that the seven
[2:17:23] priests bearing the seven trumpets of
[2:17:25] ram's horns passed on before the lord
[2:17:27] and blew with the trumpets and the ark
[2:17:29] of the covenant of the lord followed
[2:17:31] them and the armed men went before the
[2:17:34] priests that blew with the trumpets and
[2:17:36] the rearward rearward came
[2:17:38] after the ark the priest going on and
[2:17:41] blowing with the trumpets and joshua had
[2:17:43] commanded the people saying you shall
[2:17:45] not shout in other words you're going to
[2:17:47] have to be quiet
[2:17:48] nor make any noise with your voice
[2:17:50] neither shall any word proceed out of
[2:17:52] your mouth until the day i bid you shout
[2:17:56] all right then
[2:17:58] then
[2:17:59] shall ye shout so the ark of the lord
[2:18:01] compassed the city going about it once
[2:18:04] and they came into the camp and launched
[2:18:06] in the camp and we'll skip down a couple
[2:18:08] verses
[2:18:09] you you know the the story that were
[2:18:12] that we're talking here
[2:18:14] came to pass a verse 16
[2:18:17] verse 15 i'm sorry it came to pass on
[2:18:19] the seventh day that they rose early
[2:18:21] about the dawning of the day and
[2:18:22] compassed the city after the same matter
[2:18:26] seven times
[2:18:27] only on that day they could pass the
[2:18:30] city seven times it was only on that
[2:18:32] seventh day that they compassed seven
[2:18:35] times and it came to pass at the seventh
[2:18:37] time when the priest blew with the
[2:18:39] trumpets
[2:18:40] joshua said unto the people shout
[2:18:43] for the lord hath given you the city
[2:18:47] they didn't take the city
[2:18:48] the lord had given them the city
[2:18:51] and the city shall be accursed even it
[2:18:54] and all therein to the lord only rahab
[2:18:57] the harlot shall live she and all that
[2:18:59] are with her in the house because she
[2:19:01] had hid the messengers that were sent
[2:19:04] that we sent
[2:19:07] down to verse
[2:19:08] verse 20 because the other ones is
[2:19:10] talking about how the things were to be
[2:19:12] kept for the lord kept for the levites
[2:19:15] verse 20 so the people shouted
[2:19:18] when the priest blew with the trumpets
[2:19:21] and it came to pass
[2:19:23] what came to pass came to pass what god
[2:19:26] said was going to happen
[2:19:28] when the people heard the sound of the
[2:19:30] trumpet and the people shouted with a
[2:19:32] great shout that the wall fell down flat
[2:19:36] so that the people went up into the city
[2:19:38] every man straight before him and they
[2:19:41] took the city
[2:19:43] now some people might look at that and
[2:19:45] they say oh
[2:19:46] that's just a good story
[2:19:49] that's a good story for us to read for
[2:19:52] an encouragement
[2:19:54] it's just that's all it is a story no
[2:19:58] that's not just a story
[2:20:00] that's not fiction this morning that is
[2:20:03] something that actually happened
[2:20:05] it really happened and it happened
[2:20:08] exactly the way god said it would happen
[2:20:12] i don't know how
[2:20:13] except by god
[2:20:16] i don't have a way to explain it
[2:20:18] too many people today get get stuck in
[2:20:21] this uh in this need
[2:20:23] of um
[2:20:25] i need i need to understand
[2:20:28] how a certain thing happened and if you
[2:20:30] can't explain it well enough for me to
[2:20:32] understand how it happened
[2:20:35] then i can't believe it and it must be
[2:20:38] false well i'm sorry
[2:20:40] you can either choose to believe it
[2:20:42] or not
[2:20:44] there's so many things in this scripture
[2:20:46] that i can't go in and prove to you
[2:20:49] that i can't prove to you that jonah was
[2:20:51] swallowed by a well
[2:20:54] but it says it in the bible so i believe
[2:20:55] that it happened
[2:20:57] you know i can't prove these things and
[2:20:59] i don't have to prove these things it
[2:21:00] stands on its own when somebody comes to
[2:21:03] you and say well do you have any proof
[2:21:05] that this happened or that happened
[2:21:07] no i don't need it i have faith
[2:21:11] he said it happened so i believe it
[2:21:12] happened
[2:21:13] and that's all that matters to me you
[2:21:15] know in our natural mind we would look
[2:21:17] at that and say
[2:21:18] that there's no way
[2:21:21] that that really could have happened can
[2:21:23] you imagine
[2:21:24] could you imagine joshua after receiving
[2:21:27] this message from from the lord and he
[2:21:29] comes back to his camp
[2:21:31] and the lord spoke to him and told him
[2:21:33] describe to him what what's going to
[2:21:35] happen and what they need to do so
[2:21:37] here's joshua
[2:21:39] going to this
[2:21:40] group of men
[2:21:42] that are warriors
[2:21:45] they're warriors
[2:21:46] they're ready to fight
[2:21:48] they've got their swords they're ready
[2:21:50] to fight and he they come back and
[2:21:51] they're like did you get a word of the
[2:21:53] lord yeah got a word of the lord and
[2:21:55] they're excited they're ready to go
[2:21:57] we're going to go take this city we're
[2:22:00] going to take it by force and what did
[2:22:02] the lord say to us joshua what'd he say
[2:22:04] to us he said well all right hang on um
[2:22:08] you might want to sit down i'm going to
[2:22:10] try to explain to you
[2:22:12] what he said
[2:22:14] well we're ready to go we're ready i've
[2:22:16] got my sword i'm ready to go i can go
[2:22:18] now let's let's go fight this is what we
[2:22:20] trained for this is we're ready for this
[2:22:22] the lord has told us that this is our
[2:22:24] land and that we can go take it and
[2:22:27] we're not gonna we're not gonna have any
[2:22:28] death right you know that's that's where
[2:22:30] it should have been a can ruined that
[2:22:32] but that's a different message
[2:22:35] but he he goes back and sits down with
[2:22:37] him and says
[2:22:39] hey i'm going to tell you what
[2:22:42] now
[2:22:43] when we go in
[2:22:45] we're going to go over there
[2:22:47] and um
[2:22:49] i don't want y'all to do anything
[2:22:55] you what
[2:22:59] leave your shorts sheathed
[2:23:02] be very quiet
[2:23:06] don't speak a word
[2:23:08] and this is what god said he told me now
[2:23:10] y'all got to believe me
[2:23:12] he told me
[2:23:13] that if we'll go over there and we'll
[2:23:15] walk around the city
[2:23:17] and just be really quiet
[2:23:19] and let the priest blow the trumpet
[2:23:22] then we're going to come back to camp
[2:23:27] and i can see those men
[2:23:31] speaking to the other one
[2:23:34] i think that he's lost his mind
[2:23:38] something's wrong with joshua
[2:23:41] and we need to go get it checked out
[2:23:44] he needs to go see the physician
[2:23:46] because something's wrong
[2:23:49] this is not how you fight a battle
[2:23:51] you don't fight your battle by just
[2:23:53] going in and walking
[2:24:01] [Music]
[2:24:05] but that's what god told him to do
[2:24:09] but i'm sure he had a tough time
[2:24:10] convincing them at first
[2:24:13] and i can just see the guys talking back
[2:24:14] and forth okay well
[2:24:16] what are we going to do after that
[2:24:17] joshua
[2:24:18] then we're going to go fight right
[2:24:21] no
[2:24:25] we're going to do the same thing the
[2:24:26] next day
[2:24:28] have you lost your mind
[2:24:31] we have never heard of anybody trying to
[2:24:34] overtake
[2:24:35] a city especially a walled city
[2:24:40] just by being quiet that makes no sense
[2:24:43] joshua
[2:24:44] so okay so on the on the third day
[2:24:48] we're gonna go in early in the morning
[2:24:50] while they're still sleeping and we're
[2:24:51] gonna we're gonna overtake the city
[2:24:53] right he said
[2:24:55] no that's not what he told me guys
[2:24:58] see you see when the when the messenger
[2:25:00] came to me he gave me specific
[2:25:02] instructions so if y'all would just if
[2:25:04] you would sit for just a moment and
[2:25:06] allow me to express what he told me
[2:25:09] i'll tell you the fullness of what the
[2:25:11] messenger said and he this is what he
[2:25:13] said to me now i want you to do this
[2:25:15] same thing
[2:25:17] six days in a row
[2:25:19] and the only noise is going to be is the
[2:25:21] priest is going to blow the trumpet
[2:25:24] but you're going to be quiet
[2:25:26] and then on the seventh day
[2:25:29] you men of war
[2:25:31] are going to walk around the city seven
[2:25:33] times and the priests are going to blow
[2:25:35] the trumpet and then you're going to
[2:25:37] sing
[2:25:42] wait a minute
[2:25:43] we're men of war we have singers
[2:25:46] we have people that play music
[2:25:49] and you're asking men of war to sing
[2:25:52] have you heard us sing
[2:25:54] have you heard us sing joshua
[2:25:57] i've listened to them they can't carry a
[2:25:59] tune in a bucket
[2:26:01] but joshua said that's what god said
[2:26:05] and no matter how silly it seemed to
[2:26:07] them
[2:26:09] they actually believed him enough to do
[2:26:10] it
[2:26:13] they believed him
[2:26:15] enough to follow the instruction
[2:26:19] that god gave through that prophet to
[2:26:22] them
[2:26:24] they did not understand it i guarantee
[2:26:26] you they did not understand it
[2:26:28] but they believed it enough to do it
[2:26:31] and to follow it
[2:26:32] verbatim
[2:26:34] exactly the way he said to do it because
[2:26:36] if they had not followed it exactly
[2:26:39] they would not have been victorious
[2:26:42] but they took evidently there had been
[2:26:44] things in joshua's life before this is
[2:26:46] the way i look at it
[2:26:48] i believe that there were enough things
[2:26:50] in joshua's life that had happened
[2:26:52] before
[2:26:53] that they could base
[2:26:55] off of that and they could say you know
[2:26:57] what
[2:26:59] god does speak to joshua
[2:27:01] and it would really behoove us
[2:27:04] to listen to that man of god
[2:27:06] now even when we don't understand it
[2:27:08] exactly
[2:27:10] even when we don't
[2:27:11] see it fully clear played out in front
[2:27:14] of us
[2:27:15] but there's something about that man
[2:27:17] that whenever he comes to us and say hey
[2:27:19] guys this is what the lord spoke to me
[2:27:22] yesterday and it happens
[2:27:24] and he comes to you next week and says
[2:27:26] this is what the lord spoke to me today
[2:27:28] and it happens there had been enough of
[2:27:31] that take place
[2:27:32] previous to this point i believe
[2:27:36] that they would have enough faith
[2:27:38] to follow the commission that was sent
[2:27:41] through that prophet and that told them
[2:27:43] this is how we will overcome
[2:27:46] this is how we will fight our battles
[2:27:48] and we're not fighting our battles we're
[2:27:50] going to let let god do it for us and
[2:27:53] that's what god wanted them to do
[2:27:55] he wanted them to yield he wanted them
[2:27:58] to just believe he he wanted them to
[2:28:00] have faith
[2:28:02] enough faith in the man of god and the
[2:28:04] word that was coming from him to just
[2:28:06] simply believe it
[2:28:08] and that's what we need to do today
[2:28:11] it's a simple message it's simply
[2:28:13] believe the psalm was sung so many times
[2:28:16] only believe
[2:28:17] all things are possible if we only
[2:28:20] believe you know we we read in um
[2:28:23] read the story of um the wedding at cana
[2:28:27] and um
[2:28:29] they come up short on the wine
[2:28:32] you know come up short on the wine and
[2:28:34] and they uh they come to jesus and you
[2:28:36] know they
[2:28:37] they
[2:28:38] start telling him you know mary's mary
[2:28:40] comes to him and says hey
[2:28:42] they're running little a little short on
[2:28:44] the wine
[2:28:45] he's like
[2:28:46] what do you want me to do about it
[2:28:48] it's not my time you know what what why
[2:28:51] why are you troubling me with about
[2:28:52] about wine
[2:28:54] why do i need to do anything about that
[2:28:57] but mary turned
[2:28:59] to the servants
[2:29:00] and this is what she said to them
[2:29:03] whatever he says
[2:29:07] whatever he says
[2:29:09] do it
[2:29:12] that was simple wasn't it yes and so he
[2:29:14] tells them hey go go fill these pots
[2:29:16] with water
[2:29:17] and i'm sure they're thinking
[2:29:20] water is not going to work
[2:29:22] i've drunk water all my life and water
[2:29:24] stays water
[2:29:26] why are you going to give people water
[2:29:28] but
[2:29:29] mary was convincing enough to them
[2:29:31] to say whatever he says
[2:29:34] do it
[2:29:35] now we don't have anything previous to
[2:29:37] that that i have found
[2:29:39] that displays miracles that were
[2:29:41] performed
[2:29:42] in the scripture that's the first one
[2:29:44] that i see
[2:29:45] so how did mary know
[2:29:48] i believe that there were things that's
[2:29:50] not written in the scripture that jesus
[2:29:52] had done in their home in in his life
[2:29:54] and around her and she had witnessed it
[2:29:57] enough times to know it may seem foolish
[2:30:00] it sure did seem foolish to peter
[2:30:03] whenever jesus tells him hey won't you
[2:30:05] cast your net on the other side of the
[2:30:06] boat
[2:30:07] you know because peter that's what he
[2:30:09] did for a living he was a fisherman
[2:30:12] i mean he he knew
[2:30:14] that sea better than anybody else i'm
[2:30:17] sure he knew it better than jesus in in
[2:30:18] the the natural sense
[2:30:21] that because jesus wasn't a fisherman
[2:30:23] so jesus goes out there we were we were
[2:30:26] um we on a fishing trip uh just a couple
[2:30:28] of weeks ago and we were only about
[2:30:30] three miles off the coast of uh south
[2:30:33] carolina north carolina um out there was
[2:30:36] going to do some uh offshore fishing and
[2:30:39] so as i'm sitting out there and my dad
[2:30:41] was with me
[2:30:42] and um
[2:30:44] we're just sitting there on the boat and
[2:30:45] the boat was just kind of it was very
[2:30:46] calm that day um which was
[2:30:50] crazy calm the water was just still as
[2:30:52] it could be even the captain was like we
[2:30:54] have
[2:30:55] 0.0 knots of wind there's nothing that's
[2:30:58] moving out here and we're sitting there
[2:31:01] and dad looks over to me he says
[2:31:04] looking out the water he says
[2:31:06] i wonder if we should cast on the other
[2:31:08] side
[2:31:10] he said no wouldn't doesn't that kind of
[2:31:11] sound silly looking at all of this
[2:31:14] massive water that we're around that's
[2:31:17] around that's surrounding us and he says
[2:31:20] don't you think that seemed a little
[2:31:21] silly to peter
[2:31:23] whenever he was sitting there and he'd
[2:31:25] been fishing all night long
[2:31:27] on the seat what i think was the sea of
[2:31:28] galilee that they were on that's that's
[2:31:30] only
[2:31:31] that's about what eight miles by 16
[2:31:34] miles or something like that that's
[2:31:36] that's the size of the body of water
[2:31:38] that's um that's there
[2:31:40] so i don't know how far off the shore
[2:31:42] they had went and doing their fishing
[2:31:45] and um but he's like just just cast it
[2:31:47] on that side i'm sure peter's thinking
[2:31:50] do you think we're an idiot
[2:31:52] do you think we are an idiot you know
[2:31:54] we've been doing this all night long
[2:31:56] this is what i've done all my life my my
[2:31:59] my dad was a fisherman my grandfather
[2:32:01] was a fisherman this is this is what we
[2:32:02] do you know we we know how to catch fish
[2:32:04] and there's just no fish out here
[2:32:07] but it was a simple peter looked at him
[2:32:09] and says
[2:32:10] at thy word
[2:32:13] it wasn't at peter's understanding
[2:32:16] it was at peter's acceptance of the word
[2:32:19] of god
[2:32:21] and that's what mary was telling them
[2:32:23] no matter what he says to do just do it
[2:32:26] brother branham would say in one of the
[2:32:28] messages i was listening he said that's
[2:32:29] still a good message today
[2:32:31] that's still relevant today whatever he
[2:32:34] says
[2:32:35] just do it
[2:32:36] just simply obey there's so much that
[2:32:39] goes with with obedience if we could
[2:32:41] just simply
[2:32:42] obey
[2:32:44] so look looking back on the
[2:32:46] on the story we read there of jericho
[2:32:48] that was each day
[2:32:50] for six days they would compass the city
[2:32:53] men of war priests with the trumpets
[2:32:55] they were ought to remain silent except
[2:32:57] for the priest
[2:32:59] they were to blow the trumpets each day
[2:33:02] and as i look at that i i see a
[2:33:06] similarity
[2:33:08] of how we are we're now in the seventh
[2:33:10] church age there's been six
[2:33:13] ages before us
[2:33:15] and in each age the priests have went
[2:33:18] out
[2:33:19] and they've blown the trumpet
[2:33:21] they the the gospel message has went out
[2:33:25] each age
[2:33:27] we're in the seventh age
[2:33:29] so there's something extra that needs to
[2:33:31] happen in the seventh time that it goes
[2:33:34] around
[2:33:36] that's whenever you have the priest
[2:33:37] blowing the trumpet
[2:33:39] and you have us men of war
[2:33:41] that shouts
[2:33:43] that's where we're at now brother
[2:33:45] branham said
[2:33:46] there was a place that he had said that
[2:33:47] he had um 1962
[2:33:50] he had been around the world seven times
[2:33:53] in 1962.
[2:33:54] and i i
[2:33:55] when i when i read that i'm like well
[2:33:59] that's the seventh day
[2:34:01] in the seventh church age
[2:34:04] and the church age messenger that priest
[2:34:06] went around
[2:34:08] seven times had already went around so
[2:34:10] what's left what's left is for us
[2:34:14] it's our time now and it's our time to
[2:34:16] shout because the trumpet has been blown
[2:34:20] and we still have a portion to play we
[2:34:22] still have a part in this the this great
[2:34:26] orchestra and our part is to shout
[2:34:29] exactly to prophesy again it's our turn
[2:34:33] to shout the problem is today that we um
[2:34:35] people let too many of their
[2:34:37] circumstances
[2:34:38] get in the way of their shout they uh
[2:34:41] they they keep looking as we said last
[2:34:42] night they keep looking at their
[2:34:43] problems rather than looking at their
[2:34:45] promise they let their situation just
[2:34:48] stifle their joy and all they see is
[2:34:51] that big old wall of jericho standing up
[2:34:53] in front of them and they have forgotten
[2:34:55] what joshua's told them they've
[2:34:57] forgotten what the holy ghost has told
[2:34:59] you that you can stand in front of that
[2:35:01] wall and you you you raise a shout and
[2:35:04] that wall is going to come crumbling
[2:35:06] down and you're going to be able to walk
[2:35:07] straight forward
[2:35:09] right across it many times we have we we
[2:35:12] struggle with with getting
[2:35:14] past our past i've made mention of that
[2:35:16] last night our flesh it just continues
[2:35:19] to remind us of the things that we've
[2:35:20] done and that's what creates that wall
[2:35:23] in front of us so many times that um
[2:35:26] we see our shortcomings
[2:35:28] we see we see our problems every time we
[2:35:32] look in a mirror
[2:35:33] we see who we are in our eyes i'm so
[2:35:36] thankful he doesn't see me the same way
[2:35:38] i see me he sees me through his eyes and
[2:35:42] through the blood
[2:35:43] we have to look to the unseen this
[2:35:46] morning this afternoon we've got to look
[2:35:47] to the to the unseen and look to it by
[2:35:50] faith and claim our victory if there's a
[2:35:53] wall of worry that's standing in front
[2:35:55] of you just shout it down
[2:35:57] just stand up to it and shout it down
[2:36:00] if there's a wall of fear that's that's
[2:36:01] got in front of you shout it down
[2:36:04] you worship you praise you bring his
[2:36:06] presence in front of you right there and
[2:36:09] through that presence you can you can
[2:36:12] knock the walls down

[2:36:16] to do it but your worship is what's
[2:36:18] going to bring him on the scene and
[2:36:19] through your shout you will have your
[2:36:22] victory through your shout

[2:36:27] messages
[2:36:28] at toward the end of the service brother
[2:36:30] branham is praying
[2:36:32] and he says lord
[2:36:34] i pray that in the name of jesus christ
[2:36:36] that the holy ghost will drive back
[2:36:39] every gloomy spirit
[2:36:41] every doubting spirit
[2:36:43] and may the witness of jesus christ
[2:36:46] which is now present to prove that he's
[2:36:49] the same
[2:36:50] yesterday
[2:36:52] today
[2:36:53] and forever
[2:36:54] break down the walls of the devil
[2:36:57] doubting
[2:36:58] ungodly spirit that would move around
[2:37:01] over here and may every person be healed
[2:37:05] oh thou devil i charge thee by the son
[2:37:08] of god jesus christ of nazareth that you

[2:37:15] every person may be free them sitting
[2:37:18] there with arthritis the woman sitting

[2:37:40] claim your god-given victory this and
[2:37:43] this is brother branham saying that this
[2:37:45] is
[2:37:46] your time to shout

[2:37:53] to shout
[2:37:56] hallelujah
[2:38:00] and he says in the in the walls of
[2:38:02] jericho as it was the enemy
[2:38:05] that's keeping you out
[2:38:07] will fall to the ground
[2:38:09] and every power of the devil will be
[2:38:12] broken in jesus christ's
[2:38:15] name
[2:38:16] [Music]
[2:38:17] if we accept it
[2:38:19] if we believe it
[2:38:21] if we take hold of it if we shout
[2:38:25] that's how we defeat satan
[2:38:27] that's how we have the victory this
[2:38:28] morning the victory is in our shout out
[2:38:32] the victory is here it's in our shout
[2:38:35] this morning
[2:38:38] we've already said it once
[2:38:40] it's not your battle
[2:38:43] it is not your battle stop thinking that
[2:38:45] you've got to fight it it ain't yours to
[2:38:47] begin with
[2:38:49] our flesh it focuses on the negative
[2:38:51] things
[2:38:52] our flesh
[2:38:54] binds us up and makes us think that it's
[2:38:56] our battle and i've got to make my way
[2:38:58] through it i've got to figure out a way
[2:38:59] to to make it through this no you don't
[2:39:02] he's our he is your way
[2:39:05] he is your way
[2:39:07] whenever he's when he's on on the cross
[2:39:10] and he says
[2:39:11] it is finished
[2:39:15] three words
[2:39:16] it is finished
[2:39:18] what was finished
[2:39:20] everything
[2:39:22] everything was finished the plan of
[2:39:25] salvation that he had placed put in
[2:39:27] place it was finished
[2:39:29] whatever you have in need of
[2:39:31] it's already been done
[2:39:33] it's already been done we just have to
[2:39:35] accept it we just have to walk into it
[2:39:38] and receive it and accept it and your
[2:39:40] healing your victory is already provided
[2:39:44] to you but sometimes people they
[2:39:47] they fail
[2:39:49] a while back there was a um
[2:39:52] there was a promise given to us through
[2:39:54] the government brother steve that um if
[2:39:57] you were eligible that you were going to
[2:39:59] get a stimulus fund they were going to
[2:40:02] you were going to get money and i
[2:40:04] remember whenever that was put out on
[2:40:06] the news and
[2:40:07] it was a buzz around word everybody
[2:40:11] talking about it and everybody's saying
[2:40:13] that i'm i'm going to do this and i'm
[2:40:15] going to do that and this is what i'm
[2:40:16] going to buy and they had already made
[2:40:18] plans they'd already spent the money
[2:40:22] before it ever got into their account
[2:40:25] just because a promise was given to them
[2:40:29] by the government
[2:40:30] which
[2:40:32] you don't always trust the government
[2:40:35] they'll tell you a lot of things
[2:40:38] but i saw and i witnessed
[2:40:40] individuals get so excited
[2:40:43] so enthused because it's going to get a
[2:40:45] piece of money
[2:40:47] and based on that promise to receive
[2:40:50] they made plans
[2:40:52] they made plans they already knew what
[2:40:54] they was going to spend it on
[2:41:00] i don't know how many promises
[2:41:03] are in this
[2:41:05] written word
[2:41:07] but i can tell you one thing i don't see
[2:41:09] as many people getting so excited
[2:41:12] and making plans
[2:41:14] based on a promise
[2:41:17] if god gives you a promise he will keep
[2:41:20] it
[2:41:21] go ahead and make your plans for it
[2:41:24] don't say you know well i don't want to
[2:41:26] i hate hearing people say well i would
[2:41:28] do such and such but i don't want to get
[2:41:30] my hopes up
[2:41:31] i know the lord told me that that he
[2:41:33] could he could heal me i know the lord
[2:41:35] told me that he could answer this
[2:41:37] problem but you know i really don't want
[2:41:39] to get my hopes up just in case
[2:41:42] something don't go the way i think it's
[2:41:44] going to
[2:41:46] where's your faith
[2:41:49] i want my hope to be built up
[2:41:51] i want my hope to be at a level in my
[2:41:54] faith to be a level that i can receive
[2:41:55] the promise because if i le if i sit off
[2:41:58] to the side say well i don't want my
[2:41:59] hopes to get up too much
[2:42:01] then all you're going to do is live in
[2:42:03] the dimension of doubt
[2:42:05] you're not going to fully receive and
[2:42:07] accept what god has promised for you
[2:42:09] because you're not in a position to
[2:42:12] receive it
[2:42:13] because in your mind you've already set
[2:42:16] off to the side you've already doubted
[2:42:17] it
[2:42:19] there should be no doubt in our mind at
[2:42:21] all when god gave you a promise he fully
[2:42:24] intends to keep it you've got to accept
[2:42:26] it you've got to be in the position to
[2:42:28] receive it
[2:42:30] you are an eligible receiver recipient
[2:42:34] of every single promise that he has
[2:42:37] given to you this morning go ahead and
[2:42:39] make plans
[2:42:40] go ahead and make plans based on the
[2:42:43] promise that he gave you
[2:42:47] amen
[2:42:48] i believe that
[2:42:51] there so many people are not seeing
[2:42:52] victory today
[2:42:54] they're they're
[2:42:55] they're defeated all the time
[2:42:58] it's because of a barrier of unbelief
[2:43:01] there's a barrier of of doubt and
[2:43:03] unbelief that that's in their way and
[2:43:05] they they have a wall of worry that
[2:43:07] stands up so high and they can't see
[2:43:09] past
[2:43:10] that that wall that's standing there
[2:43:14] that's what is is is dividing them
[2:43:17] from being in the presence of the lord
[2:43:19] is is their worries their unbelief
[2:43:22] brother branham would say in in the
[2:43:24] message of the unseen 1958 he says oh if
[2:43:27] the church of this day
[2:43:29] could ever pray
[2:43:30] till they pass the sin barrier
[2:43:33] an unbelief barrier
[2:43:35] they could shout the victory of a living
[2:43:38] god
[2:43:39] when they once pass that barrier by
[2:43:42] looking to the unseen
[2:43:45] and letting the world vibrate and do
[2:43:48] what it wants to
[2:43:49] don't get your eyes on the world they're
[2:43:51] going to do their thing
[2:43:53] it's not important to me what they're
[2:43:55] going to what they're doing i'm looking
[2:43:57] to his promise
[2:43:59] i'm looking to his promise that he has
[2:44:01] given to me and i'm going to go past i'm
[2:44:04] breaking past breaking through this the
[2:44:06] sin barrier the unbelief barrier there's
[2:44:09] there's turbulence you know they've
[2:44:11] talked about it whenever a jet tries to
[2:44:14] breaks the sound barrier that there's
[2:44:16] turbulence in that jet and there will be
[2:44:18] turbulence in your life as you're trying
[2:44:20] to break through
[2:44:22] the barrier of worry the barrier of
[2:44:24] unbelief there will be turbulence in
[2:44:27] there but if you just hold on and you
[2:44:30] hang on to it and you let him carry you
[2:44:33] through
[2:44:35] there is victory
[2:44:36] on the other side there is freedom on
[2:44:40] the other side if you can ever break
[2:44:42] through that wall of worry that's got
[2:44:44] got you out of the presence of god you
[2:44:47] can move through that into his presence
[2:44:49] there is fullness of joy
[2:44:52] there is happiness there is love and
[2:44:55] there is peace
[2:44:57] there is peace so many people today they
[2:44:59] don't they don't understand peace they
[2:45:01] don't have peace in their life
[2:45:03] they're they're struggling they're
[2:45:05] troubled by all the things of of the
[2:45:07] world and it's because they have not
[2:45:09] held on to his promise
[2:45:12] and they've let go of that and they got
[2:45:14] their eyes too much on the things of
[2:45:15] this world
[2:45:16] and not on god
[2:45:18] but get your eyes off of the world don't
[2:45:20] let those things sway you
[2:45:22] there
[2:45:23] those things are going to happen around
[2:45:24] you but we are not a part of this world
[2:45:27] we're here
[2:45:28] in this place but we're not a part of
[2:45:30] that
[2:45:32] i don't want to be a part of it i want
[2:45:33] to be as far separated from it as i can
[2:45:36] i don't want to i don't want to be
[2:45:38] involved with any of that i want to be
[2:45:41] truly in his service we've been given
[2:45:44] a shield of faith
[2:45:46] not a shield of fear
[2:45:47] and some people put up a wall of fear
[2:45:49] and stand behind that but we've been
[2:45:52] given a shield of faith that we'd be
[2:45:53] able to move forward in the battle he's
[2:45:56] given us a victory shout
[2:46:01] the next time that that satan comes to
[2:46:03] you and and wants to tell you
[2:46:06] you know what there is just no way
[2:46:10] there's no way that you can overcome
[2:46:11] this trial
[2:46:14] you can do what you want you can say
[2:46:16] what you want but there is no way that
[2:46:18] you can overcome this trial
[2:46:21] that's what satan is going to tell you
[2:46:25] and he'll make you believe it if you
[2:46:26] keep listening to him
[2:46:28] but whenever he tells you that
[2:46:30] you uh you remind him of what's said
[2:46:32] over in second chronicles chapter 20.
[2:46:36] if you look in chapter 20 verse 13
[2:46:39] down through
[2:46:41] well we'll read maybe down to 22 or so
[2:46:44] it says and all of judah stood before
[2:46:46] the lord with their little ones their
[2:46:47] wives and their children that upon
[2:46:49] jehaziah the son of zechariah and the
[2:46:51] son of banaya the son of jail the son of
[2:46:54] matani and a levite of the sons of asaph
[2:46:58] came the spirit of the lord in the midst
[2:46:59] of the congregation and he said hearken
[2:47:01] ye
[2:47:02] all judah
[2:47:04] and ye inhabitants of jerusalem and thou
[2:47:07] king jehoshaphat
[2:47:09] thus saith the lord unto you
[2:47:11] be not afraid
[2:47:13] nor dismayed by reason that's what gets
[2:47:16] us many times is our reason of this
[2:47:19] great multitude
[2:47:21] for the battle
[2:47:23] is not yours
[2:47:25] but gods
[2:47:27] you look at satan the next time he comes
[2:47:29] to you say the battle is not mine it's
[2:47:32] the lord's
[2:47:33] he's already overcome
[2:47:36] he stood he hung on the cross he said it
[2:47:38] is finished
[2:47:40] he already overcame it is not my battle
[2:47:43] i don't need to pick it up
[2:47:45] he he took care of it for me brother
[2:47:47] steve
[2:47:48] all i have to do is just rest
[2:47:50] rest in the completed work that he has
[2:47:52] done you know
[2:47:54] um
[2:47:54] elijah
[2:47:58] elijah got tired
[2:48:00] elijah got went through a period of
[2:48:02] depression you know he he had the the um
[2:48:06] experience on mount carmel
[2:48:08] and god did mighty works
[2:48:11] and he leaves from there
[2:48:13] and he
[2:48:14] runs he goes it goes and you find him
[2:48:18] under a juniper tree
[2:48:20] and while he's sitting under the juniper
[2:48:21] tree
[2:48:23] he's saying to the lord
[2:48:26] it's enough
[2:48:28] you read read what he says he says it is
[2:48:30] enough
[2:48:31] just take my life
[2:48:33] let me let me go just just
[2:48:36] well if he was really wanting to die why
[2:48:37] didn't he just stay where he was at
[2:48:39] jezebel wanted to kill him
[2:48:43] [Music]
[2:48:45] he could have just stayed where he was
[2:48:46] at and she would have done that work for
[2:48:47] him
[2:48:49] but you see he he he was in a state of
[2:48:52] depression
[2:48:53] he was in a in a state of tiredness and
[2:48:56] and he he run from that and he was at a
[2:48:58] place of just saying lord you know why
[2:49:00] don't you just just take my life it is
[2:49:03] enough and as i read those scriptures a
[2:49:06] little while back i read those
[2:49:07] scriptures where he was saying it is
[2:49:08] enough i was like there's another place
[2:49:10] in the scripture that that my mind goes
[2:49:13] to that something similar and i was
[2:49:16] thinking of jesus christ when he was on
[2:49:18] the cross
[2:49:20] and he didn't say it is enough
[2:49:22] he said it is finished
[2:49:25] he wasn't saying you know because if i
[2:49:27] put it in our lingo what elijah was
[2:49:29] saying well i've had enough
[2:49:32] whenever he was saying it is enough his
[2:49:35] our lingo would would be today god i've
[2:49:38] had enough of this mess i've had enough
[2:49:41] of this struggle that i'm in i've had
[2:49:43] enough of this problem that i'm walking
[2:49:45] through today and i just i'm giving up
[2:49:47] i've had enough
[2:49:49] jesus hung on the cross and he says
[2:49:53] i am enough
[2:49:55] [Music]
[2:49:57] you may say i've had enough and jesus
[2:50:00] looks at you he says
[2:50:01] look to me because i am enough
[2:50:04] i am enough i have whatever you have
[2:50:07] need of this morning thank you god
[2:50:09] i am enough and i've already finished
[2:50:12] the work
[2:50:13] all you have to do is receive it and
[2:50:14] give him praise and shout and give him
[2:50:17] thanks and give him worship and give him
[2:50:19] adoration for all the things that he has
[2:50:22] already given to you
[2:50:23] there should be no struggle from you
[2:50:25] because the struggle is over because he
[2:50:28] has already completed the work
[2:50:31] let me try to wind up this morning we're
[2:50:33] going to wind up or wind down don't
[2:50:35] defense the the right word
[2:50:38] in
[2:50:42] over in um
[2:50:44] oh later in that scripture i didn't
[2:50:46] never did finish reading the scripture
[2:50:48] in
[2:50:52] oh my my
[2:50:54] well
[2:50:58] yeah with second chronicles i'm trying
[2:51:00] to see which which verse that
[2:51:03] that said about the ambushments
[2:51:08] and i thought that was there
[2:51:10] it is
[2:51:14] 22.
[2:51:15] okay yeah on why i was thinking 20 but
[2:51:17] it was 22.
[2:51:20] and it says and when they begin to sing
[2:51:24] and to praise
[2:51:26] the lord set ambushments against the
[2:51:29] children of ammon moab and mount saiyar
[2:51:32] which were come against judah and they
[2:51:35] were smitten
[2:51:36] the lord sent the ambushments
[2:51:39] when they praised
[2:51:41] when they sang
[2:51:43] when they worshiped when they began to
[2:51:46] sing
[2:51:47] the lord released the ambushments
[2:51:49] against the enemy and all they had to do
[2:51:51] was sing
[2:51:53] just sing what we were doing this
[2:51:54] morning just singing just worshipping
[2:51:57] him and he comes down and he sets the
[2:52:00] ambush against the enemy and he takes
[2:52:03] care of the battle that you have this
[2:52:05] morning there there's a pattern that i'm
[2:52:07] i'm hoping that you're seeing this this
[2:52:10] afternoon that that when we begin to
[2:52:13] give him our worship
[2:52:15] when we begin to give him our adoration
[2:52:18] that he comes on the scene and he
[2:52:21] performs a work that you cannot do
[2:52:24] he performs a work that we cannot do at
[2:52:27] all and he
[2:52:29] it's his battle
[2:52:31] and he says i'll take care of it if you
[2:52:33] will just let me all i want you to do is
[2:52:35] praise me for it i want to hear you your
[2:52:38] worship i want you to enter into praise
[2:52:40] and i've taken care of it if you look
[2:52:42] over in in paul and silas
[2:52:46] and i'll try to finish up
[2:52:49] if i can with this this morning
[2:52:52] again my my clocks and y'all's clocks
[2:52:54] are different things and that gets
[2:52:56] confusing to me and and um
[2:52:58] i had no idea
[2:53:00] last night that it
[2:53:02] went so long and i please forgive me for
[2:53:04] that i no intention to do that but i
[2:53:06] tell you i was just having a good time
[2:53:07] in the lord and and y'all were having a
[2:53:10] good time with me so
[2:53:11] i didn't want to leave so in the book of
[2:53:13] acts chapter 16
[2:53:17] verses 25
[2:53:19] through 31
[2:53:22] it says and at midnight
[2:53:25] paul and silas pray
[2:53:28] odd time to pray right at midnight they
[2:53:31] didn't have nothing else to do
[2:53:33] they're sitting there in the jail
[2:53:34] and they're they're in stocks and bonds
[2:53:36] and they said
[2:53:38] they prayed
[2:53:39] and they sang praises
[2:53:41] unto god
[2:53:43] and the prisoners heard them now what's
[2:53:46] important about the prisoners hearing
[2:53:48] them because if you understood the types
[2:53:50] of prisons that they had in the jails
[2:53:53] that they would have been put in there
[2:53:54] their their rock it was places that was
[2:53:56] hewn out of out of rock and so they
[2:53:59] would put them into these places and the
[2:54:01] sound doesn't carry
[2:54:03] in those places so it tells me they were
[2:54:06] being loud
[2:54:07] because the other prisoners heard them
[2:54:10] and suddenly there was a great
[2:54:11] earthquake
[2:54:13] i believe there was an earthquake here
[2:54:14] this morning so that the foundations of
[2:54:16] the prison were shaken and immediately
[2:54:20] all the doors were open
[2:54:22] and everyone's bands not just theirs
[2:54:26] everyone's bands were loosed
[2:54:29] [Applause]
[2:54:33] their worship
[2:54:35] brought freedom to those that was around
[2:54:37] them
[2:54:40] their worship
[2:54:41] set other people free
[2:54:44] glory to god
[2:54:47] too many times we sit down
[2:54:49] and we're we're we're just concentrating
[2:54:51] on ourself and and i'm concerned about
[2:54:53] me and i'm going to worship for me but
[2:54:55] your worship can set other people free
[2:54:59] your disobedience can bind them up just
[2:55:02] the same
[2:55:04] your disobedience in in not worshipping
[2:55:07] can cause people to not get their
[2:55:10] healing
[2:55:11] i've heard brother branham say that
[2:55:14] your disobedience and your
[2:55:16] non-participation
[2:55:17] can you stubbornness thank you that's
[2:55:20] the right word the stubbornness can
[2:55:23] cause other people to to miss their
[2:55:25] healing
[2:55:27] to continue to be bound i don't want
[2:55:30] that on me this morning
[2:55:32] at all so he said
[2:55:35] they were all everyone's bands were
[2:55:37] loosed and the keeper
[2:55:39] of the prison the jailer the keeper of
[2:55:41] the prison awakening out of his sleep he
[2:55:44] was
[2:55:45] he was just all out of sorts waking up
[2:55:47] out of his sleep and seeing the prison
[2:55:49] doors open
[2:55:51] he drew out his sword
[2:55:53] and would have killed himself
[2:55:55] supposing that the prisoners had been
[2:55:58] fled
[2:56:00] but paul wasn't going to let that happen
[2:56:02] paul cried out
[2:56:04] with a loud voice saying
[2:56:06] do thyself no harm
[2:56:09] for we are all here
[2:56:12] then he called for a light they didn't
[2:56:13] have a light in there
[2:56:15] but he recognized by the commotion that
[2:56:17] was going on that that
[2:56:19] i think the lord just showed him that
[2:56:21] the prison guard was getting ready to
[2:56:23] kill himself because they didn't have a
[2:56:24] light
[2:56:25] he called for a light
[2:56:27] and sprang in
[2:56:28] and came trembling
[2:56:30] this is the prison guard and fell down
[2:56:32] before paul and silas
[2:56:35] and then he brought them out
[2:56:37] and said sirs
[2:56:38] what must i do
[2:56:41] to be saved
[2:56:43] what must i do
[2:56:45] to be saved
[2:56:46] he's talking to prisoners
[2:56:50] asking a prisoner
[2:56:52] what must i do to be saved
[2:56:55] and they said
[2:56:57] believe on the lord jesus christ
[2:57:00] and thou shalt be saved but he didn't
[2:57:03] stop there
[2:57:06] he didn't stop just with him
[2:57:09] if you believe
[2:57:11] you can be saved
[2:57:13] in the house
[2:57:15] he didn't leave it for just that
[2:57:20] one glory
[2:57:24] hallelujah
[2:57:28] praise your name lord jesus
[2:57:31] glory be to god
[2:57:36] the house
[2:57:38] your family
[2:57:40] your children
[2:57:42] their children
[2:57:43] their children
[2:57:45] their children and their children own
[2:57:49] and on and on
[2:57:52] because he believed
[2:57:55] i believe i see a group of believers
[2:57:57] here this morning
[2:57:59] hallelujah a group of believers that we
[2:58:02] believe on the name of the lord jesus
[2:58:04] christ hallelujah could the musicians
[2:58:07] come
[2:58:08] this morning
[2:58:10] it says they began to sing in praise
[2:58:12] it was loud enough
[2:58:14] to others for others to hear it
[2:58:18] i would just love
[2:58:20] it
[2:58:21] i'd love to know what they say
[2:58:25] i wish i knew what songs they sang
[2:58:27] brother steve so i can only imagine
[2:58:30] in my mind what they may have sung
[2:58:33] you know because they read they read the
[2:58:35] old testament scriptures
[2:58:37] you know i believe that maybe when paul
[2:58:39] and silas
[2:58:40] was sitting there and
[2:58:43] maybe paul looked over at silas and said
[2:58:48] you know i was reading the other day
[2:58:49] silas and
[2:58:51] in isaiah
[2:58:53] and isaiah said
[2:58:56] they that wait
[2:58:58] upon the lord
[2:59:01] we're here in this prison
[2:59:04] there's nothing else that we can do
[2:59:06] but wait can you give me the key of g
[2:59:08] this morning we'll try in the key of
[2:59:10] [Music]
[2:59:13] that g
[2:59:15] upon the lord
[2:59:19] shall renew
[2:59:22] their strength
[2:59:24] they shall mount up
[2:59:32] [Music]
[2:59:41] oh they shall walk
[2:59:45] in not faith
[2:59:47] teach me lord
[2:59:50] teach me lord
[2:59:53] [Music]
[2:59:56] maybe silas looked over
[2:59:58] at paul and said you know the psalmist
[3:00:01] david said it this way
[3:00:03] the lord
[3:00:04] he is my shepherd
[3:00:07] i
[3:00:08] shall
[3:00:10] not
[3:00:12] won't he
[3:00:14] maketh
[3:00:16] me to lie down in
[3:00:19] green pastures
[3:00:22] [Music]
[3:00:25] he restored
[3:00:28] my soul
[3:00:30] and he
[3:00:32] made
[3:00:34] me whole
[3:00:36] teach me lord
[3:00:39] teach me lord
[3:00:42] to
[3:00:43] wait
[3:00:45] oh
[3:00:47] they that way
[3:00:50] upon the lord
[3:00:53] will shall renew
[3:00:56] their strength
[3:00:59] they shall mount
[3:01:01] glory to god with wings as
[3:01:06] he
[3:01:06] glows
[3:01:10] they shall run
[3:01:13] and not be weary
[3:01:16] oh they
[3:01:18] shall not faint
[3:01:22] teach me lord
[3:01:25] teach me lord
[3:01:28] to wait
[3:01:32] as i continue to think of their
[3:01:34] conversation that they must have had
[3:01:36] that that evening and singing together
[3:01:39] and praising me or maybe
[3:01:41] maybe silas looks over at paul and says
[3:01:43] you know paul
[3:01:44] the reason that we're in this prison
[3:01:47] is because we just can't shut up
[3:01:50] we can't keep our mouth shut
[3:01:53] of what god is doing
[3:01:55] and i think maybe he looked over and
[3:01:57] that it and said a little a little bit
[3:01:59] peppier this morning well he's done so
[3:02:01] much for me
[3:02:03] that i cannot tell it all
[3:02:06] who i cannot tell it all
[3:02:09] but i cannot tell it all
[3:02:11] oh he's done so much for me
[3:02:14] that i cannot tell it all
[3:02:17] he has taken my sins away
[3:02:22] well he's done so much for me
[3:02:25] that i cannot tell it all
[3:02:28] who i cannot tell it all
[3:02:31] i cannot tell at all he's done so much
[3:02:35] for me
[3:02:36] that i cannot tell it all he has taken
[3:02:41] my sins away
[3:02:44] well he gave me victory and i cannot
[3:02:49] tell it all
[3:02:50] i cannot tell at all
[3:02:53] but i cannot tell it all jesus gave me
[3:02:57] victory
[3:02:58] and i cannot tell it all he has taken my
[3:03:03] sins
[3:03:04] away
[3:03:05] oh
[3:03:06] he's done so much for me
[3:03:09] that i cannot tell it all i cannot tell
[3:03:13] it all
[3:03:15] i cannot tell it all oh he's done so
[3:03:18] much for me
[3:03:20] that i cannot tell it all
[3:03:22] he has taken my sins
[3:03:26] [Music]
[3:03:31] hallelujah
[3:03:34] hallelujah
[3:03:36] i believe their praise got loud
[3:03:39] i believe their worship was loud
[3:03:42] i believe that paul looked over maybe he
[3:03:45] looked at silas he says
[3:03:47] i said i wasn't gonna tell nobody but i
[3:03:51] can't keep it to myself i can't keep it
[3:03:55] to myself

[3:04:00] wasn't gonna tell nobody but i can't
[3:04:03] keep it to myself of what the lord has
[3:04:06] done

[3:08:23] thank god for the victory
[3:08:27] [Music]
[3:08:32] isn't he wonderful
[3:08:34] isn't he worthy to be praised
[3:08:38] you know uh
[3:08:39] sometimes
[3:08:41] when you get in an atmosphere
[3:08:44] especially people
[3:08:46] who are not used to that atmosphere
[3:08:49] they can become very nervous
[3:08:52] and emotional
[3:08:53] and they may not understand what's
[3:08:55] happening to them
[3:08:57] they may even feel like they're afraid
[3:08:59] during our camp meeting there was a
[3:09:00] woman that come in here that i had not
[3:09:02] seen in years and she should have been
[3:09:04] she has experienced the presence of the
[3:09:06] lord many times before but she was so
[3:09:08] nervous her whole body
[3:09:10] was just trembling and
[3:09:13] her granddaughter was afraid for her
[3:09:14] because she didn't understand what was
[3:09:16] happening
[3:09:18] and this happens sometime and we don't
[3:09:20] know what's happening to us or we we may
[3:09:22] see someone like that and we don't know
[3:09:24] what's happening to them
[3:09:26] but this is somehow
[3:09:28] sometimes the way that we respond just
[3:09:30] play something
[3:09:32] this is the way that that we respond to
[3:09:34] the presence of the lord when we're not
[3:09:36] used to feeling that presence
[3:09:38] some people don't know what it is how
[3:09:40] many of you are glad you recognize his
[3:09:42] presence
[3:09:44] but i want to pray for you right now
[3:09:46] just from here
[3:09:47] but i want to pray for you maybe you're
[3:09:49] streaming the service you're not used to
[3:09:52] feeling then
[3:09:53] and and it it just disturbs your your uh
[3:09:56] you know you're feeling a little bit
[3:09:58] well i want you to know that will not
[3:10:00] hurt you
[3:10:02] that presence of the lord will not hurt
[3:10:05] you
[3:10:06] it'll change your life forever more
[3:10:09] if you'll let him
[3:10:10] he didn't come to make us afraid
[3:10:13] he comes to let us know he's real
[3:10:15] and sometimes that tug
[3:10:18] what that is is a tug
[3:10:20] on the other end of the line
[3:10:21] to let you know god is there
[3:10:24] and he can make himself real
[3:10:27] to you
[3:10:29] i want god to do that for all of you
[3:10:31] that may have been in that place this
[3:10:33] morning so would you just bow your head
[3:10:35] with me a moment father
[3:10:37] we have experienced your
[3:10:40] wonderful presence here
[3:10:43] and we recognize that there may be those
[3:10:46] among us who are not used to feeling
[3:10:48] that are seeing
[3:10:50] such a display and a demonstration
[3:10:53] of joy and victory
[3:10:55] and it may set their system
[3:10:58] just a little little out of sorts
[3:11:01] but i ask you lord
[3:11:03] to draw
[3:11:05] each one
[3:11:06] into a closer relationship with you
[3:11:10] let each one know that you are real
[3:11:14] and that that doesn't happen
[3:11:17] to cause them to fear or to reject
[3:11:20] it happens to draw them in
[3:11:23] and to let them know that this is more
[3:11:26] than just a mental concept but it is a
[3:11:29] reality
[3:11:30] having a relationship with you lord
[3:11:33] is more than just a place to go on
[3:11:35] sunday
[3:11:37] it's a daily
[3:11:38] relationship so i ask you right now lord
[3:11:42] for every person under the sound of my
[3:11:44] voice
[3:11:45] who has not really surrendered to you
[3:11:48] will you give them grace
[3:11:50] to say yes
[3:11:52] will you give them grace
[3:11:55] to invite you into their life
[3:11:58] that you might save them from the awful
[3:12:01] guilt of sin
[3:12:03] and
[3:12:04] let them experience a new birth
[3:12:07] they've been born of the earth
[3:12:10] lord i pray that they can also be born
[3:12:12] of heaven
[3:12:14] born by the spirit
[3:12:16] we also pray
[3:12:18] as we come to the close of this youth
[3:12:21] meeting this weekend that you will come
[3:12:24] by the holy spirit and seal in
[3:12:28] everything you have done for us i
[3:12:32] believe lord that
[3:12:34] even
[3:12:35] parents and
[3:12:36] chaperones and those who help to
[3:12:40] cook and prepare i believe we've all
[3:12:43] experienced
[3:12:45] the reality of who you are
[3:12:47] in these meetings
[3:12:49] seal it in holy ghost
[3:12:51] seal it in as we leave this place today
[3:12:54] may we find courage
[3:12:57] not to allow the enemy to talk us out
[3:13:00] of anything that you have done for us
[3:13:03] lord our hope is in you
[3:13:06] our trust is in you and we want to give
[3:13:10] you praise and honor and glory for every
[3:13:14] bit of it in the mighty name of the lord
