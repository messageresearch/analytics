Description:
Man looks at the surface—the outward appearance, the performance, the things easily seen. But God sees deeper, past every layer and into the heart itself.

God isn't impressed by religious façades or spiritual pretenses. He searches for authenticity and integrity, calling His people to leave behind hypocrisy. It's not about appearing righteous, but truly living it.

Now is the time for honesty and purity, not hiding behind disagreements or superficial judgments. If God wrote your life's truth openly, would you change?

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Because man looks on the outward shell. Man looks at the tinted glass. Man looks on the layer, the surface of what can be seen or perceived. But God sees beyond the badger skin, brother. God sees what's on the inside. And it is by that that he chooses us. It's by that that he anoints us. It's what he knows about our heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may seem to be the most religious of them all and the most spiritual of them all on the surface, but God's not looking at your performance only. He's looking at your heart. He alone has the right to judge our motives. &gt;&gt; One of the things the Lord dealt with me about a couple of weeks ago in prayer, he said, "I'm going to deal with hypocrisy in my church first. I'm going to deal with that first and foremost. &gt;&gt; I'm going to seek out those who pretend to be one thing and live an entirely different thing. That's what I'm going to deal with first. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm depending on him. &gt;&gt; If there's any hypocrisy in my life, I want it dug out with a grubbing hole. I want it revealed to me so that I can do something about it &gt;&gt; because I'm the only one who can take it up with the creator. &gt;&gt; I'm the only one that can make up my mind. I cannot stress to you today the importance enough of having a determined mind, having a madeup mind to hold out, to hold on, to go all the way &gt;&gt; and to be what you say you are. Amen. It's the life of Jesus Christ that we claim. &gt;&gt; We claim to be the very reflection of his light in the earth. May our lives begin to line up. &gt;&gt; He knows exactly what's going on in our lives. And he's calling us to a place of integrity. &gt;&gt; Integrity is everything. &gt;&gt; It's everything. It's so much a part of our character in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; This is not a time for drawing other people in &gt;&gt; to our our beef, to our disagreement with someone, &gt;&gt; to our opinion with someone. This is the hour that we should as brothers and sisters desire to somehow cover. I don't mean cover sin, but I mean to to sort of act as a protection &gt;&gt; so that everybody doesn't have to know. What if a hand would appear uh this morning and write on the wall over there between those windows? What if the hand of God were to write there today? Your soul is being weighed in the balance &gt;&gt; and found wanting. &gt;&gt; It's not enough. It's not measuring up. Would you want God then to continue to write your sin on the wall there for everyone to read? Or would you rather take that as a warning from the Lord and go clean up your life? &gt;&gt; Lord, purify us and then refine us &gt;&gt; and then refine us again. &gt;&gt; Aba also uses this season of misunderstanding to anchor you in God's approval. rather than in the approval of men.
