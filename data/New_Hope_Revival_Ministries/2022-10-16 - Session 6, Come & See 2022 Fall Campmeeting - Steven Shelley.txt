love you Jesus thank you thank you thank you Jesus [Laughter] refresh and restaurant oh Lord we let you refresh us O Lord you refresh us Lord [Music] you're a store in you renew us by your spirit O Lord brother Greeley recently reminded us of a word that was given here many years ago concerning rest in the presence and in the glory of the Lord and just keep that moving keep that playing [Music] he's got an amazing memory but it was a little bit different that he remembered it off just slightly the Lord said it's better than 12. I don't know when I mean who gets 12 hours of sleep this would be my dream this would be better than a week's vacation but the Lord said it's better than 12 hours of sleep two seconds resting in the glory of the Lord is better than 12 hours of sleep two seconds resting in the glory of the Lord hallelujah Hallelujah we take our rest in you Lord [Music] take our rest we take our rest we take our

Jesus brother Elam we want to invite you and those that are coming to sing come and worship the Lord keep in this atmosphere we're so blessed to have this part of our congregation from Indiana they worship together but they love us and they honor us with their presence we love every one of them and are so grateful you all didn't know it apparently apparently didn't pass the word Hallelujah [Music] we praise you we pray you Jesus we give you glory Lord [Music] how I love you Jesus can I just say this you know the very the very fact that these folks are here is very spiritual and Supernatural to me to me because God gave me a vision that I was walking among people who were dressed plainly and that God was sending a Revival I believe it's yet to come but that God was sinning a Revival I was riding in the back of an Amish buggy and I shared this with brother Levi Fisher before he went home to be with the Lord I was riding in an Amish buggy and I had in my hand a book of brother Branham a spoken word book and God showed me in that experience that there would be a Revival among the people I didn't know these people existed and that's exactly what they're contending for is that God will reach the peoples the families where they have come from and so when I'm among them when they're with us I am at real peace because to me they represent something that is yet to come and it must come quickly because he's coming God bless you all it's a privilege to be here now we just really enjoyed this weekend and and uh the anointing was so strong I was just thinking well I kind of hope West just keeps it going like that we don't have the same this morning but I had failed earlier that I should let him know that we can so uh we're willing to if we should now I felt like we should first of all uh sing maybe one person a course of a German song for freda's sake so we'll do that and then then we have another song that it's really a good song that uh I hope you can hear the words and listen closely it's a good song [Music] is [Music] yeah baby God is still me I lift down me therefore I say that's the course God truly loves me he truly loves me he loves even me yes [Applause] [Music] blessings were his spirit is [Music] [Music] on the cross [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] me with me [Music] foreign [Music] my God [Music] [Music] cheers [Music] [Music] [Applause] praise the Lord Hallelujah don't take them away just yet I'm gonna leave them there you know I've been invited to go for several years and I've not made it there yet and one of the reasons why is I'm afraid I won't come back [Laughter] assistant the reason I was weeping so it reminded me back when I was a child when we had brush Harbor meetings and that's the kind of singing chin me oh

to get ready to turn in your Bibles to Isaiah chapter 40. but before you do I want us to sing just the chorus because I don't think we can do I can do much more than that but let's just sing the chorus of spread your wings Little Eagles all right since we're going to be reading from Isaiah 40 and you don't have to worry about me I'm all right I'm just going to rest my legs for the first few minutes and then when I feel the Lord's anointing then I'll get up there's no need and there's no need in hurting when you're getting started right so God is good he's good all the time he's my healer he's my deliverer I'm not discouraged amen my handicap is under the Lord's table all of it is under his table Sister Janet Miller sent me a little text this morning was so encouraging her and brother Eddie Miller were having breakfast in their hotel and there is a group of disabled or or handicapped uh athletes so that they're you know they're they're challenged I guess is the best way of saying it now but they overcome a lot and they're staying in the hotel there and there was a a young man who came in with with no legs and he was riding on a board and it looked like his brother she said with him helping him and she was distracted a moment and looked back and didn't see him finally found him he was sitting on a high table over there and he looked just like everybody else because his hindrance his handicap was underneath the table I said oh what a glorious confirmation that his team all of my shortcomings all of my failures all of my handicaps Hallelujah his table is large enough to cover it all so spread your wings let all he go and fly you weren't born you weren't born to live in the valley no you were born [Music] to the ground oh Mount up with wings [Music] I might just do this little part all at once his Spirit left till I was high above foreign [Music] [Music] and though I had spit many years in that old Barnyard I was always [Music] sing it out Little League [Music] you were not born to pick around in that old Valley no you are predestinated you were born the sky don't let your trials [Music] found up foreign [Music] Just Keep Your Eyes Upon the Sun the son this old battle is nearly one Mount up with wings [Music] praise God for the victory [Applause] praise God for the victory [Music] [Applause] amen thank you to the musicians thank you to the worship leader [Applause] Isaiah 40. verse 28 through 31 and we don't have a whole lot of voice but it's pretty good right this second it won't sound nice it'll be a little Gravelly I I thought his brother Greely was singing with their voices clear and strong and all of our voices cracking in here that's going to be another benefit of Eternity we can sing all the time and never get hoarse I would rather uh know that I had over praised over sung over shouted over preached over amen then over cheered at some old football game if I was going to lose my voice I'd rather lose it for the King of Kings and the Lord of lords they tell me there was a man a visitor here last night his wife had asked me the night before to pray that he would come she said I'm going to have to drag him and and I thought well my he must not be a church-going man well that wasn't it yesterday Alabama was playing Tennessee and he was an Alabama fan and so he came he had his Bible on his lap and his phone propped up beside it about about that's exactly what I said sister Joyce I said at least he was here I said now none of the home folk better try that but he was a visitor and I said at least he was here and in the presence I mean that I mean that but all about halfway through the services [Music] because Alabama who's not used to losing lost and you could have probably heard all the people at Happy Valley shouting because they're big Tennessee fans you could have probably heard them all the way down here because they finally beat Alabama you know what I could care less there's only one one tide I want to get rolled over and that's the pressures of this life we used to sing he'll roll me over the tides and uh but anyway I thought that was outstanding and brother brother Gary that was that was because of you that was that was because of your invitation and I appreciate that very very much that you invited that lady to come and she brought a group of people with her because of your invitation and there was a sister there who as we got to the handicapped part of the service she stood there in that aisle the entire time supporting me for preaching and maybe they don't understand what we understand or or know some of the things we know they may know something we need to know but we certainly know something they need to know but this is where they belong to be this is where they ought to be able to come and receive from the Lord and I don't ever want this to be a house where people cannot come and receive you know if this message is what we think it is and what we believe it is then we want everybody to have an opportunity to experience the reality of it and the reality of this message is the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ and I want to say to this body of Believers before we read the word you are so gracious thank you so much that you have always allowed it to be that kind of an atmosphere where people could come and visit and be blessed and go home and maybe we never see them again but we have a little part in their Journey everybody's not the bride of Christ everybody's not a part of the Bride everybody that's in the Bride is a part of the church but everybody that's in the church is not a part of the Bride I believe that your amen should be a little stronger than that and so we know that one of these days we're going to spend eternity not only with those who overcome the spirit of the age but also those who go into dark tribulation and who give their lives for the cause of Christ and they're going to be those who lay their head on a chopping block and have it cut off in Great Tribulation time because they will not deny the Saving Grace of the Lord Jesus Christ there's only one group of people going in the rapture and it's those that have the oil it's those that have the oil that I didn't say that say that Isaiah 40 28 has not thou hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the Everlasting God the Lord the creator of the ends of the Earth faith not neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding he giveth power how many of you have been a benefactor of this I've been a beneficiary of this he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he does what he increases their strength haven't you been at the end of your strength and he breathed on you just a little more to get you a little higher up oh Hallelujah and and this is so true it's not just those of us north of 50. but even though south of 50 are fainting and getting weary around us and young men utterly falling around us but listen to what the Lord says but they that they that wait upon the Lord shall do what renew their strength they shall I want you to understand I know you're standing but I want you to understand that word now that doesn't mean beat and flap their wings until they get lifted that means they set their wing oh my God it means that do you know what it's dangerous to Hold Your Arms out like that when I do that sometime in worship or when I'm just then it's like I can feel that upward pull I'm not living by feeling but I don't mind the feel I'll tell you right now I don't mind to feel the presence of the Lord some were testifying of things they felt supernaturally in the service last night and I want to hear it all because I honor God for letting us feel anything but that's not beating your wings until you care you can't hardly go it's just finding the wind and the current of the spirit and the way the spirit that's what so many of us have gotten off course is because we forgot that it's important to catch what the spirit is doing and then we just set our wings we just Mount our wings and we just um how many of you understand the difference in flying and mounting your wings they shall Mount up with wings as Eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated I want to ask you this morning are there any Eagles here I know there are because I heard a group of eagles singing I am an overcomer and that's what Eagles do they come over they get above their circumstances they get above their trials they get above their pains and aches they get rid of their frogs that's what Overcomers do they put their crippled feet under the Masters table and they drink the water and eat the bread of the King of Kings and the Lord of lords it doesn't mean that we don't get weary it doesn't mean that we don't get discouraged it doesn't mean that we don't fight anxiety or depression or sickness or disease it doesn't mean that we don't get tired of the fight but what it does mean is in that moment when we feel so weary and we have come to the end of our strength we have learned that there is a source that we can tap into and we can live from his life or you're listening we can live from his life he is the Divine Source in this hour of our life because we died how many of you know we died our life came to an end our life's source and strength is finished in the natural the Bible tells us that the life that we now live is not our Natural Born life it's another kind of life it's of a Zoe life it's of an eternal life that will never pass away if you believe that same man am I screaming too loud at you I know it doesn't sound real good in the Amplified Bible and I often get asked about the Amplified Bible because I understand that Believers of this message are are King James version only and I am too pretty much there are some versions that I stay far away from but I use the Amplified Bible on occasion with my King James because sometimes it amplifies the verse and I needed some time to get louder because I need to understand it because it's my life source if you abide in me and my words abide in you this is where our real life comes from and uh I like the way it reads it says but those who wait for the Lord who expect who look for and hope in him shall change and renew their strength and power how many of you'd like to have your strength and power renewed they renew their strength and power they shall lift their wings that's all you do it's not a bunch of this is what we did in Pentecost this is what we did in holiness some of us came out of those backgrounds and we were like we mentioned last night we were all the time trying to beat our wings working so hard swimming so much trying to please all the different ideas that people had I've told you before that they they would come through and I was a boy and they would preach their Revelation their idea their conviction and you could never keep up with it you you every preacher that came through you had to beat your wings a little harder to try to please them come on I was a pleaser I wanted to be right with God and so if the preacher who's more spiritual than I am if he told me that I had to wear long sleeves all the time that's exactly what I wanted to do because I wanted to please God see there's nothing wrong with that sincerity but it's like the preacher that came through for my granny most of you know my grandmother was a pastor and when the message came she stepped down from from doing that but she was a pastor for many years wonderful wonderful woman of God she had an evangelist to come through in those years and he preached on Coca-Cola what a sin it was you may be here you may feel like it is and let me tell you something don't drink it to you it's a sin don't drink it you know I think I'll preach on Coca-Cola because I don't like it but now you better not say much about Dr Pepper foreign I like that burning in my throat that I get from a Dr Pepper have you all oh never mind he got up and he preached so hard about a Coca-Cola and Granny was pastoring two churches one of them was certain miles south of here on Highway 10 in in Blue Springs area of Alabama and she was working in the cotton mill and driving back and forth every night to preach I mean to take this preacher down to preach Revival and after the service she said I was so tired that I could hardly stand it and so I said to him brother I wouldn't offend you for nothing but she said I'm going to have to stop here at this little store and get a Coca-Cola or something she said I cannot stay awake and she said I've already veered off the road twice and she said I'll I'll try to find something that I can do to keep me awake maybe I could suck on a piece of candy or something and he said oh sister Shelly don't worry about that I'll take a Double Cola well did anybody remember Double Cola what four of us are we only four of us that old that was double caffeine that was double all the sugar that was double all the stuff that everybody thought was bad and here he had preached on Coca-Cola because of the name we got so tired they said a woman should wear a hat no she shouldn't wear a hat she should do this she she shouldn't do that she she oh my we got so tired of flapping our wings just trying to please the Lord and what we really ended up doing was trying to please man you don't have to help me preach I'll preach without you if I have to and that's not what God wanted us doing I believe in personal conviction I believe in standards and I believe in personal standards and I believe in corporate standards I believe if you want to be a part of a church you have an obligation to follow the standard of that church I believe that is just common sense if you work in a retailer and they tell you a certain way a certain color to wear you do that if you work for a corporation that says no no mustache no facial hair you shave it off and so if you want to be a part of a body you have an obligation to pay a price but don't think for one moment that that is going to bring you any closer to the Lord because these are things that God deals with people differently according to their station and status in life and according to their own sinful nature there are certain things that some people have to stay away from I always mention this and then I'm going to get off the subject but in the in the Pentecostal Revival that was going on in Brownsville and I only kept up with that because my grandmother had prayed many times for brother we called him out and killed Patrick but in that Revival he was going by the name John Kilpatrick but granny knew him as Alton and God was doing some wonderful things among those Pentecostal people those Assembly of God people and people were coming from everywhere and giving their heart to the Lord and I don't know about you but I'm about people getting saved I'm about that I want people to get saved and get filled with the spirit because then the spirit can lead you teach you all the truth you need to know so I was for that whatever God was doing but in the midst of that is that Revival maybe it was draining a little bit the youth pastor of that group he he came out with a message that went all over the the nation and he began to tell the people that he had become addicted to a pornography and to Filthy things on the internet and she wanted to repent and wanted to make that right and he said to his to his children he said to his church I told the church about telling his children he said it was the most humiliating thing I've ever done in my life I had to set my own children down and explain to them why we couldn't have the internet in our home yeah I had to tell them that it wasn't just because there was filth on it it's because daddy couldn't keep his eyes off the film I tell you that man made a bold statement that reverberated through the body and it needs to be made again he never said that that every person couldn't have it or shouldn't have it and I heard preachers that get excited about things and they'll get mad at Facebook and they'll decide that nobody ought to have it or they'll get mad because they can't keep their eyes off the field and so they they decide nobody should even have any access to the world out there well I want to tell you something it's not that way but if you find that you've got a problem you're the one who needs to make a stand in your life and in your home and say no more I'd rather be cut off from the rest of the world and know that I'm connected to the True Vine Jesus Christ then to let a little smut keep my spirit from soaring I wasn't made to pick around in the beggarly elements of this world I was made to soar as an overcomer and to cause others to come but you see you get a little little under a little inspiration and you want everybody to do just like you do and people get wounded and and offended and they get hurt and I've been one of those people you see I've been one of those who dropped somebody before and it's not a very good feeling when you realize that your action your words something you did cause somebody's feet to be crippled and it's time I didn't finish the other part of that but if you realize and recognize that you've been guilty of that then you need to make that right with God and if at all possible write with the person that you dropped it's the right thing to do why are you so quiet it's the right thing to do it's just the right thing to do now I want to go to second Samuel chapter 17. I didn't finish reading I didn't let me let me let me finish reading Isaiah 40 31. but those who wait for the Lord who expect look for and hope in him shall change and renew their strength and power they shall lift their wings and mount up close to God as Eagles Mount up to the sun they shall run and not be weary they shall walk in not faint or become tired we're going to become tired in the physical but we don't have to be tired and weary in the spiritual before I forget to mention it let me explain about this word wait a lot of people believe that waiting on the Lord is sitting to do nothing but I want you to know that word Wade in Hebrew and often in Greek when we find it in the New Testament it doesn't mean twiddling your thumbs or sitting on your hands it means humbly and quietly serving the lord while you are anticipating something from him you're not cutting yourself off from the rest of the body you're connected to the body but you're just humbly before the Lord serving serve others if you're not getting what you'd like to get from the Lord serve others are you with me and see if God won't help you he will amen did I offend you that I upset you about Double Cola are you are you ashamed of me because I drank a Dr Pepper why did you get so quiet oh some are apologizing second Samuel chapter 17 and verse 16. I would not want to sit where you're sitting and listen to this old raspy voice thank God I don't have to now therefore sin quickly and tell David saying Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness but speedily Passover lest the king be swallowed up and all the people that are with him and then in verse 22 it says then David arose and all the people that were with him and they passed over Jordan by the Morning Light their lack not one of them that was not gone over Jordan I don't have time this morning to to find for you the context of this verse but I will tell you that I'm lifting it slightly from its context there was indeed some who wanted to linger behind and kind of sneak around and not go over and they thought they had a better strategy and there were some things that transpired but nonetheless verse 22 tells us that as the as the morning was coming up there was not one of them that didn't get over Jordan I want to encourage you tonight uh today it's time to get over it's time to cross over it's time to make a decision that we will not Lodge one more night in the wilderness we've already decided we don't need another night with the frogs now we're deciding that we will not Lodge one extra night in the wilderness but that we will find our way back to our source we will find the rock on which we were born we will find our way to Victory and we will not play with our soul we won't gamble with our life brother Greeley get a microphone would you there and I want you to read the quote for me I'm going to save my voice we're going to read putting on the whole armor of God I hope you can stay with me we're going to read paragraph 82 and I want you to read it like I would read it I I I I love I know some people don't like the quotes I love the quotes but I love the way I read them I listen to something no wonder people don't pay no attention they say oh the juices who wants to sit through all that so do your best brother I know you can no pressure you're about as hoarse as I am the chief the chief is leading leading us home amen come on home yes in my father's house or many mansions if it wasn't so I'd have told you I'll not leave you comfortless I'll come again and be with you even in you to the end of the world yes the works that I do you do also a little while and the world seeth me no more yet you shall see me yes for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world chief leading on Amen my Lord knows the way through the Wilderness come on all I have to do is follow him hear the tramping up the Army marching on to Victory not paying any attention to all this unbelief and old prose buzzards hollering around we're Eagles let's soar out of everything amen that's amazing thank you so much [Applause] you can't help the crows are saying call call are you with me the gifts are over call too late too much emotion oh we hear all of that they're too Pentecostal [Music] we can't focus on what the buzzards are saying we can't focus on what the crows are saying we're following our chief we've gotta make a way through the Wilderness the Lord knows the way the Lord knows the way to bring us back to Victory all we have to do is what follow let me hear you say follow to do is follow our leader our chief he knows the way so don't get your eyes on what they're saying oh we're getting so many streams they're watching this meeting they're watching to see who's moving and who's not moving who's talking in tongues and who's not talking in tongues you know what it doesn't matter to me that has been following me for many many many many many many years I want to thank God for the internet yeah yeah I want to thank him for it I want to thank him for it now listen let me tell you this I just feel like we're having a chat probably because I'm sitting down but uh my grandmother was a prophetic woman and the the television was about to break and the Holiness people were very much against the thought of the television and I don't blame them because they were already preaching about going to the movies now all the churches go to the movies but in those days people didn't go to the public places of entertainment and uh and God blessed them for being separated from the things of the world now our little children know the names of movie stars and and pop stars that they ought not to even know who they are and that's our fault a lot of our our faults for for you know exposing them to those kinds of things but the church uh was very strong and they knew that that people were going to begin to buy these televisions and and they didn't start in every home they started in a neighborhood one family with a little more means than the rest would buy a television and everybody would go over there to watch something and I don't think it was much the screen was about that big the television set was about this big but the screen was about this big and the screen sat way up in the unit so it's like you were looking through a tunnel to see anything and the preachers were calling them one-eyed Devils that's what they are and they were calling them televisions and that's what they are because they have piped a lot of Filth into people's homes and lives and caused people to buy and do and things they would never do before and that's the truth you you can you don't have to say Amen or nothing it's it's nothing but the truth but everybody was so far against it and one night my grandmother was sitting on the side of the church and the spirit of the Lord fell on her and she began to prophesy and out of her mouth came this prophecy that a great evil was coming and that this device was going to fill the homes eventually with all kinds of Filth and and all kinds of worldly things but the spirit of the Lord said through her do not despair for I will also use that device to take the gospel to the outer reaches of this world and those who would never have a chance to hear the gospel any other way will hear it be because of this so let your position be that it can be used as evil as it is it can be used for the glory of God and that settled the issue for those people they didn't buy them for their homes they had the gospel but instead of fighting that they realize that it was going to happen whether they liked it or not why not God use it for his glory that's how I feel about the internet it's full of film the worst kinds of film some felt that's so bad you've got to be you've got to be extremely creative they tell me to even find it there's a whole black web and the whole Black Market out there where people buy one by people they sell and traffic people how hideous it is but I want to say I'm so thankful that it is in our world today because it's being used to take the truth to places where the truth needs to go and just remember somebody said well I don't know if God would even be let me tell you something God is for the gospel going everywhere and here's the thing for years they tried to hide some of what was going on down here in Alabama come on they didn't want to talk about it but now because of the internet everybody who wants to be a part of these meetings was able to join and they didn't even have to put their name down so we just say God bless the spies we just love you because you had to come and see for yourself and that's the way the truth reaches out and there are people sitting here right now because of an app because of a Facebook stream because of a YouTube stream and I I want you to know I stream Ministries I listen to preaching I watch preaching on Youtube and I'm thankful to be able to receive a little cross-pollination because it's not only what God is doing here for his people it's what God's doing everywhere that interests me I want to get a little bit of everything that God is doing how many of you feel that way I want to tell you something Eagles are High Flyers they soar higher than any other bird 10 000 feet they can fly now you know the average Jets at thirty thousand feet so they're just twenty thousand feet short of a Jet Plane and you may not realize it or not but there have been mid-air collisions with jets and Eagles I guess you know the jet one some birds some birds fly higher than others anybody with me and there have been many times that Eagles have been detected 15 000 feet above the surface of the Earth and that is because they are specially designed they are aerodynamically designed by a great Creator are you awake I have to be so I think you ought to have to be they were specifically designed by a great Creator to be able to soar high and let me tell you something else they have that that very special eyelid there's so many things we could remind ourselves about but they have that very special eyelid that acts like sunglasses and when all the other birds get blinded by the Sun the eagle has the ability to turn his face right in toward the Sun and that little eyelid that drops down over his eyes I just recently saw a photograph that caught the third eyelid down over the Eagle's eye and it was incredible to see because it's transparent and yet it has properties that block out the brightness of the Sun and when there are other birds harassing the eagle and they may be Mighty and Majestic but they have some they have some tormentors sure I've seen crows trying to torment birds of prey I'm not surprised are you but you know they can do something that the rest of the birds can't do they can just turn their face right into the Sun and fly just a little bit higher and leave all the squawks behind you see God called you to soar he called you to get up above the stuff that's taking other people out let me tell you something there's a lot of things taking the church out but he's given you power to get up above it if you so choose there's no Sparrow can go where an eagle can go and they have such a large wingspan up to seven feet across that they're able to use that that large wingspan to catch the currents of the air to get higher and let me tell you something they're not only High Flyers they're fast Flyers they can soar using the currents of the wind and they have been clocked at 40 miles an hour which is 65 kilometers an hour I'm telling you that's booking it through the sky brother Greeley I want you to read 196. we're going somewhere from God's only provided place of worship read this for us where's this mic that's the same thing in the church they're trying to mix denomination with the word wait a minute I want to wait for the amen to make the try to make the word say what the denomination says and when you do that you have to spray them and baby them and give them gold stars to come to Sunday school and everything else let people let people have a minute pack a pews pack been a gospel church down here gives big Television Satellite sets away to get people to come to church [Music] them Old-Timers would roll over in their graves you can have free coffee and donuts in the sanctuary if you'll come to church their mixing denomination with the word yes they're they're making hot men probably say well aren't they reaching Souls yes but here's the thing many times they're not making converts no they're making they're making hot house plants yes sir members members that have to be sprayed and babied and petted come on now right right they couldn't take a real gospel spanking anybody with me I'm with you give them a gold star because you know in this day everybody gets a trophy everybody read on brother that's right when a genuine born-again Christian born with the word of God he's rugged that's you how many ruggeds here amen the lies and things of the world don't bother him praise God he's an eagle he flies Plum past it see soars in the Heavenly see it is true nothing nothing can stop him nothing can hold on now let's read Revelation 4 7 for a moment I had a I had an experience on Thursday night we had a glorious service here put the verse out please we had a glorious service here Thursday night the Lord came down in a mighty mighty way yes he did and I went home and as I began to begin to kind of Drift Off to Sleep I had an experience and I called them experiences when I'm not quite sure what they are because there are so many different things that God can use we can have dreams we can have visions we can have night visions we can have encounters and so an experience is something spiritual and you're not 100 sure I'm not 100 sure if I was dreaming if I was dreaming it happened so quickly after dozing off that it almost baffles the rules of science because it's in a certain stage of sleep that your body usually uh is dreaming and in this experience I saw a valley full of eagles many I wouldn't be afraid to say hundreds of them and they were they were staggering they they were not walking around with confidence they they were stumbling into one another and it was very concerning to me and I know this story well because it was almost 30 years ago that I wrote the chorus the song that we sung a minute ago and I wrote it after hearing Bobby Thompson who was known as the as the as the eagle preacher how many of you ever heard of Bobby Thompson he was born and raised just a few miles from here and he had one of the most unusual experiences with eagles of any man alive and he preached a series of sermons in his little bitty Baptist Church that have gone all over the world how many of you have ever heard him any of you ever heard Bobby Thompson's Eagle messages six or seven eight of you and I first discovered them ah just before hearing the message of the hour and I always loved Eagles God had spoken to me one time in an experience and he said surround yourself with eagles so I went to the Bible bookstore and I I bought a eagle picture and an eagle pen and an eagle statue and and I put Eagles all around me little did I know that it wasn't pictures of eagles I was going to surround myself with but it was walking talking believers that are called to live the eagle life I want you to know you're called to live the eagle life you may have been living the turkey life but you're called to live the eagle life you may have been living the crow life or the Buzzard life but you were called to live the eagle life and so I listened to these messages and and feasted on this experience that Bobby Thompson was able to have in in the Eagle Valley which is near Cherokee North Carolina where the Cherokee reservation is and I am Jewish on my mother's side and Cherokee Indian on my father's side so I've always loved the heritage of the Cherokee People and it is a mystery how so much of the Hebrew language has made its way into the Cherokee tongue there must be something about it because when the Cherokee Chiefs go to Israel I was there one time when Cherokee Chiefs came from other nations even that they had scattered into and gathered in Jerusalem they met with the rabbis and the newspapers reported that they were able to communicate with one another in full sentences because there's so much Hebrew in the Cherokee language don't you find that interesting brother pritzner a very intelligent German brother who used to be a part of our church who has gone home many years now to be with the Lord he was a linguist and he studied the Cherokee language and he was also so fascinated how much Hebrew language was there and so when I heard that such a place existed where the Eagles met in this Valley near Cherokee I wanted so so much to see it but I was never able to see it for myself so I have had to see it Through The Eyes of Bobby Thompson who I understand is it was very ill a couple of years ago and may have already gone to be with the Lord for all I know now he may be one of the only living non-cherokee non-native American men that was ever allowed to go and see this Valley where the Eagles go when they reach about their middle age so when I saw in this experience Thursday night these Eagles stuggering around and stumbling around in this big Valley I immediately begin to think about that and I thought surely I'm seeing these Eagles in their in their moping period in their period of of middle age and brother Branham tells us in the message that it's only one particular kind of eagle that goes through this this kind of experience and I preached this last year and I showed the church some historical references where even Rabbi spoke and said that every 10 years the eagle goes through this period that he nearly forgets who he is he forgets how to fly he forgets that he was born to soar the heights and he finds himself pecking around and the Eagles actually come from miles and miles around to this particular Ridge and Valley near Cherokee North Carolina on reservation land and close to the public and when Bobby Thompson was there he saw over 30 Eagles down in that Valley unable to fly so in my experience if you're following me I I thought maybe that's what I was seeing but I began to see uh what looked like a dark hooded very small figure not the size of a man or a woman but but much smaller what I call an imp with a hood over its face and it was moving very very you know none conspicuous among those Eagles and I saw in his in its hand a pair of shears I begin to recognize that this creature of of some sort had made its way through this vast number of eagles who had come here to rest and he was clipping the feathers of their wings he was disabling them like we preached last night so that they would no longer be able to fly and I I begin almost immediately to notice that I had two companions one was sitting on my right one was sitting on my left and I didn't know who they were exactly one looked a little familiar to me but I couldn't quite make out who it was I turned to the one on my left and I said how long will it take for these feathers to grow out so that these Eagles can fly again he said to me it comes in Cycles and I said what does that mean he said some seven years some 14 years some 21 years and some 28 years I said what happens if an eagle hasn't got his feathers back in 28 years and he says they die I just began to grieve you know you you you're not going to feel what I felt because I'm in the middle of it I just begin to rock like this and I begin to travail in the spirit grown and moan in the spirit there's nothing any sadder brother Branham talks about taking Joseph to the zoo and there's nothing any sadder than seeing an eagle that was destined for the sky locked up in some kind of cage unable to fly I was in the in the in the park in in Tennessee where they where the national Federation to protect the American bald eagle was headquartered and and they took in these injured Eagles and at least they gave them a netted aviary so that when they began to get their strength back they had some room to fly but I too remember seeing one over here in the cage that had been hit by a car and had to have his wing amputated and I saw that eagle with my own eyes turned toward that that hilly area some of you were there where all those other eagles were nested and and flying around and his cage was right across from that from that aviary and it seemed to me like he had the saddest expression on his face because he too was born to soar but with a wing amputated he would never reach those Heights again and so it would just really saddened my heart there's nothing sadder than seeing something that was born to be free suddenly become uh uh uh contained in such a way that it can't make its flight I have seen it in the natural and I've seen it in the spiritual and what I was looking over in the spirit Thursday night was a group of eagles that had just stopped to rest but there's a time to rest and there's a time to soar there's a time to roost in a tree and there's a time to take to the sky but they made a fatal mistake they came all the way down and touched the Earth there's something about the pull of the Earth that holds the eagle these Eagles that Bobby Thompson saw he was taken there by a Cherokee whose name was Tacoma he had never seen that many Eagles in the wild they actually took a Jeep down into the valley and Tacoma encouraged this preacher to go and pick up one of the Eagles folks I know you're terribly tired could you please he said no not me he said I'm no I'm no dummy he said I know you can't handle a wild eagle like that without some kind of protective gear your hands would be ripped up and your face could be mauled by the beak of this uh ferocious bird of prey Tacoma said no Bobby you don't understand these Eagles are helpless he said I want you to go and pick one up and I want you to look in his eye he said are you sure he said yeah let me go pick one up for you and he went and picked up an eagle and he handed it you know how large they are and he handed it to Bobby Thompson and Bobby said I looked in his eyes and I've never seen a look like that eagle had he said all around its eye was a crust that looked like psoriasis and it had gotten so bad that it had infected the Eagle's eye and I rubbed my hand down the the feathers because I knew enough to know that an eagle is self-oiling from the feathers comes in oil a natural oil that keeps those feathers fresh and soft and he said I rubbed my hand down that eagle and it was just dry as a carpet there was no oil he said I looked at his talons and all of his claws were broken off and bleeding and it looked like some kind of a parasite and eaten away at the knuckles on that Eagle's Talon how did it happen it happened because the eagle in the cycle of his life went down to that Valley and he never intended to stay but a while oh he didn't know the pull of the wilderness he didn't know the gravitational pull of planet Earth he said I'll just go down and rest for a moment or two I won't stay there long just long enough to get my breath just long enough to get my second wind but instead he got weirier and wearier and wearier until he literally forgot how to fly Bobby Thompson said I asked a coma what is this awful calcium looking buildup on the on the beak on the nostril of this eagle and he said it's a natural occurrence when an eagle gets in this stage his feathers begin to fall out because he forgets that oil that what has been instinct shuts down and the oil stops flowing he forgets to use his talent those Talons were not made to walk like feet so as he walks around in the wilderness he picks up these parasites right and because he can't heal himself anymore and oil himself anymore those parasites begin to take over and the calcium deposits anybody listening I'm not angry and the calcium deposits start building up and Bobby said his chest his breast was heaving in my arms good because he was no longer able to fill his lungs with oxygen he said the hardest thing that has ever happened to me in my life was to have to put that eagle back down oh he said I wanted to throw it in the air he said I asked a coma should I go up on the on the mountain there and throw it off the cliff surely that would remind it that it has the power to fly this Cherokee Indian said no Bobby that wouldn't make a bit of a difference because this eagle has literally forgotten what he is he said well there's nothing left then he'll die Tacoma said Bobby how about you and I going over here in this little place where the where there's a little rub out in the in the mountain and we hide ourselves in those bushes he said I want to show you something Bobby said I was going to see it all that day we went over and we sat in those little bushes he said and he began to hand me a binocular seven a pair of binoculars and he said I want you to begin to look up and he said I don't see anything with my natural I don't see anything but he said I began to look through those binoculars and way above natural sight there were Eagles circling and he said it it almost reminded me of how buzzards do they were just circling and circling and circling he said over dozen certainly he said and I noticed that every time they circled they were getting lower and lower and lower and lower and lower he said they finally got close enough that I could see that they were very mature Eagles their size and their strength allowed me to know and I said to him these are seniors these are veteran Eagles and Tacoma said yes that's exactly right he said not only that Bobby these were just like those Eagles there in fact a year ago those Eagles You see there were down in that Valley in the same shape that the rest of those Eagles were Bobby said how did they have such a change he said I'm going to show you Bobby said oh their talons are closed they've got something in their talons he said yes they do he said and they're going to drop it and when they do I want you to run out and see what it is so he said I started climbing down to the bottom back to the bottom and all of a sudden he said I those Eagles Circle they kept circling the whole way like a reverse whirlwind and just as they got just above the tree line they opened their talons and they began to drop down what it was that they were holding he said I ran out into the clearing clearing fast enough darted right back into the shrub and realized that it was squirrels it was half rabbits he said I don't understand this he climbed his way back up to Tacoma and he said what in the world is happening and Tacoma said these Eagles who have been through this trial they remember that when they had gone their last mile somebody came by and dropped down for them food bloody bloody beat [Applause] and they were able to eat it and because they ate it it gave them strength it didn't change their their parasite talons it didn't change their their psoriasis eyes it didn't change the calcium over there they're breathing but it gave them strength to do something about it [Music] their feet are busted and hanging in their beaks are clogged their feathers are ruffled they look awful but they're chewing on a piece of squirrel they're chewing on a piece of rabbit they're getting their strength back there's nothing like fresh meat how many of you have ever fanned on the fresh meat of the word it's strength to us he said to him immediately what happens what happens if they don't eat the meat he said there were three this is how he described it they'd use their wings to crawl over to that piece of meat their talent's so painful they couldn't no longer put him on the ground so they used the bend of their wings like elbows I've seen people that desperate wished you could help me I've seen people that hungry I've seen people that made up their mind in the spur of a moment pack it all up none of it matters anyway I just gotta be somewhere where there's some rabbits I gotta get some squirrels I can't afford to lay here in this Wilderness and die there's a danger Church of staying too long in the wilderness missing your opportunity great Danger of course when you do it you get laughed at and you get made fun of and you get mocked the crows someone help me with another one please I'm going to get this out as hard as it is you see some people have forgotten what it was like to be that desperate but not these Eagles circling no they remembered what it was like and so they're calling now their their purpose now they're they're not they're not wandering around saying I'm too old to do anything for the Lord I'm too wore out to do anything for God no their sake is long as they're strength in my body as long as I can grab a squirrel and rip him apart as long as I can get me a rabbit and rip his heart off and take it down to those egos who are struggling years ago it used to be handing someone a tape giving someone a spoken word book now it's pointing them to a nap for a while it was giving them an MP3 disc now it's just showing them where to go on their phone and they can hear that that spiritual food and while the modern Church finds it Antiquated and old-fashioned we find it to be Eagles food it doesn't put us off that he preached it a generation ago because it's more apropos it's more appropriate for the hour we're living in right now you don't have to follow this messenger and you don't have to follow this message but you be careful what you say against it because it's been life to me you can follow the double married and the triple married and the quadruple married preachers you can do those things if that's what you want to do but I'm going to stay with that word because that's what's given me the strength that's why I'm heading toward 50 years of ministry because that word has sustained me did I always like it no was it always easy to agree no did it tear down my paradigms and shake up my ideas did it change my baptism did it help me to see who I really was yes and it's life to me so we can just say to people now you you just pick up your phone and you can feed you can feed on that great message that God gave us you can you can feed you can feed on services from here you can feed on other Ministries that are preaching the full unadulterated uncompromised word of God with integrity no extra charge for that it is the truth he said well what happens to those who because three I think I might have told you three immediately you know I could just about name those three they made their way over there and started getting some some strength some nutrition some nourishment but there were many who never made the effort so tired so weary so seemingly discouraged depressed because literally those they have actually had scientists to come in there and watch what has taken place and they describe it as as a a depressive state the eagle has forgotten what it is who it is we might say and forgotten how to get back to it Bobby said Tacoma what happens to the Eagles that won't eat he said I see a bunch of them they're not eating anything he said come here you took him down a little Trail and there were 27 markers 27 big stones and he said I've only been coming here this place and its location has been passed down to me from generation to generation my father came before me my grandfather came before him and my great-grandfather before him he said are you telling me these are the Eagles that have died through these Generations he said no these are the Eagles that have died since I've been coming to this Valley and I buried them myself 27 Graves of eagles who were too young to die Eagles who were too young to give up who had once had their strength who had once had their their Grace oh my when were we here that three three eagles just a few weeks ago when was that that we were here on an afternoon and there were three eagles circling over the campground last Saturday was it we're putting up the tent is that what it was no in the youth meetings but during the youth meetings we've seen a pair of eagles here before but never three but this time there were two Eagles and when I was growing up there were no Eagles in this area at all no one saw eagles and now under their protected status we've been seeing them around this area there's nothing like it even the little children because they have heard the eagle stories and the preaching and they know even the little children get excited I do too I'm the biggest child of all I love to see them circling over this place because once upon a time God said build me a refuge Refuge he said he said they will come from the North and the South and the East and the west and they will take refuge here and I will shake them down and sustain them and fill them with my spirit is that it he said I will train them in the prophetic you said it I can't deny it and so when we see those natural Eagles circling around here it reminds us then I see the kids on the on this on the volleyball court and I say we've got Eagles here and we've got Eagles here in a church full of eagles here this morning I'm telling you if you have found yourself in a moping state if you have forgotten who you are and what you are and you don't have strength God has been gracious to us this week no I'm not the best preacher no I know I'm not I I have no thoughts of that brother Greeley would never claim I was I was embarrassed I told the church quietly I was embarrassed I was counting on brother Brooks to be here there are not a lot of ministers that we can have for our camp meeting I I I'm too too long in this fight to be schooled by others who haven't experienced the history of this house I'm just not going to be be uh undressed on why the gifts operate here freely and why tongues are not always interpreted sometimes their prayer and worship I'm just not going to have I'm just not going to have them come in here and correct this body who has already been through so much correction to be as close as we are and we realize there's a whole lot further to go if that sounds prideful I don't know what to say but I have an obligation to protect this people but I was embarrassed when it came down we prayed we fasted God lead us to the right person then it was so late that anybody that we would have considered inviting we were embarrassed to invite because it was so late it's almost like saying well we can't get anybody else so would you come so we got in this cycle of a tether not knowing exactly what to do but I know this God knows he saw you he saw your desire to be here and I pray that you've been blessed now I don't know about the last three services but I'll tell you what when this meeting was starting off God was using Brother Greeley to drop some squirrels okay some fresh rabbit legs so that if you were in that place where you didn't have strength to fly if you lead on that and it's here you're taking home with you you can take it home with you it's on the app you can hear it again and again and again and again and again when you find yourself in that place Hallelujah why don't you just say hallelujah give me a water break I'm hurrying this is hurry [Applause] foreign 27 Graves marked where an eagle refused to eat what was sent to him so he died how many times does God send you a word brother sister and you refuse to eat it let it Digest maybe it comes from a package that you're not familiar with maybe it comes from someone you don't know and so you're discard it because you you're just sure it couldn't be God let me tell you something God can speak to you through a cereal box God can speak to you through through a mailman through a clerk in the store God can talk to you if you're listening he's constantly trying to remind us of who he is we must not remain any longer than necessary in the wilderness and we must eat the fresh meat that God sends to us when he sends it because it's our source of life it's our source of strength now I want you to take us to letting off the pressure looks like I'm on my own to read but I can now before I read it oh my time is such a strange thing it it it never slows down for me it always speeds along here I think I've just been introducing my message let me read you before we do this let me read your Revelation no no no no no no I don't want to do that I will finish my experience every eagle has a rock when when a mama and a daddy build a nest they build it on a rock most of the time not always but in that Valley of of Cherokee North Carolina there's a lot of Rock and Bobby said it wasn't hard to identify a nest all along the upper edge of those Cliffs built right on top of huge Boulders he described one as being the size of a school bus and a big old Eagles Nest plopped right in the middle he said that rock becomes an identification for that Eagles those eaglets that are born there and that eagle as he matures will go back many times to visit that rock and if possible when he goes to bear his own Young she I get it I know how it works they go back to the same rock that they were born on you know what may an eagle mates for life an eagle doesn't try on partners for size shall I preach an eagle makes up its mind I'm going to get me the right one and I'm not going to I'm not going to trade off I'm going to find the right one and I encourage young people to find the right one and and don't dare settle for anything but the one that God has chosen for you I don't care what they look like I don't care if they're striped like a zebra if it's the one that God has given you you will love him you your heart will be one with him and he'll be the best looking zebra you've ever seen to you because it's not just the natural beauty that is attractive you better find someone that loves God more than he loves anything else or she loves God more than she loves anything else you better be finding somebody that will point you back to the Rock when you get down in the valley and you forget who you are you better get you a companion that'll come and throw you a squirrel and point you back to the rock you were born on Bobby said uh now now what will happen when these Eagles get strong and he said I'll tell you what Tacoma said take the binocular and focus on those Eagles that are eating and then raise it and raise it and raise it and raise it and finally he said stop Bobby said he looked in the binocular and all along the far Ridge he began to identify Eagles six or seven Eagles along the the lower part of of the he said at the top it was Boulders and boulders and boulders and then then beneath those Boulders smaller smaller rocks at the top and then trees on the side he said I had not seen them before I saw the Eagles in the valley I saw the Eagles coming down but I had not distinguished those Eagles there and he said I just I just scanned the whole area and I saw six or seven Eagles and he said I I asked him what are they doing he said last week or the week before they were Eagles down in that Valley eating the fresh squirrel eating the fresh rabbit now they have used their wings can't fly can't use their talons they have used their wings to pull themselves up maybe you've never struggled that hard maybe you've never had a battle like that in the spirit hell trying to take your life the spirit of suicide swarming around you in the late hours of the night the devil lying in your head and telling you nobody would care her and the world wouldn't miss a beat if you were gone maybe you've never been in that kind of a struggle maybe maybe you've never heard the enemy say you've destroyed your children they'll never serve God you just as well to give up maybe you've never heard the enemies say you're a fool you've given all your money to that church how will you pay your bills now maybe you've never had a struggle like that there's folks in this room that have and we know what it feels like when the Holy Ghost feeling is gone when there is no music when there is no song when there is no preaching to make you happy when everything you loved is gone and the bills have pied up piled up and the dog has died you've tried to kill the cat and cats everything's wrong it's in that hour that you need every bit of the strength you've got because you're heading back to the Rock you see that eagle knows if I can just get back to that rock I know you're weary me too if I can just get back to that rock brother Greely read paragraph 40 for me letting off the pressure listen wait a minute they've turned the mic off and and left why don't you just hang out there my precious brother I was reading here not long ago I preached a subject called The Eagle stirth its nest in Chicago I was reading about a certain kind of an eagle there's 40 different kinds of them they claim means a ripper with the beak God always Likens his people to Eagles he calls himself Jehovah eagle and his little Eagles that's those who are born of him and I made a little rude illustration many times on that how that how the eagle gets her little ones ready to fly and takes them up in the air and turns them loose yes and if a crow tried to get up there every feather would fall out of him he's not pressurized to it amen see he couldn't stand the pressure but the eagle is the only Bird that's born with that kind of a Feather that can go so high till a hawk couldn't even come around him and he's got eyes the higher you go the further you can see wait a minute read that again the higher you go the further you can see you're the one stay in the valley no no no hey redone and what good would it do him to get up there if he didn't have eyes to see anyway he couldn't get back where he came from and that's the way with the Christian some of the people maybe got a buzzer disposition and eating the things of the world and the vulture and try to fly up there with an eagle why he blows up there's too much pressure you've got to be made for it you've got to be made the bride is made for the Heights she's made for the pressure yes he knew it was going to take pressure pressure yes to squeeze us into the image of Christ we'll never come to the stature of the perfect man without pressure without pressure but he pressurized us yes so that we can handle it yes read on brother and this certain kind of Eagle when he begins to get old he gets weary like all of us old people and he gets a crust over his head and he gets so weary he don't know what to do and now the Bible said the eagle renews his youth so I studied about this fellow and when he gets old and weary and that crust all over his head he flies just as high he can go till he finds a great High Rock he sets down by the side of this rock and he sits there and beats his head on this rock what's he trying to do beat the crust off all the crust and the blood will fly out of his head he goes through all kinds of torture but as long as he can get to feel some of that crust on him he's got to get that off so he beats it on the Rock just keeps beating until all the crust is off of his head and as soon as all of the crust is off of his head though he's bleeding wounded he just screams to the top of his voice is off then he renews his youth it's sure to come so as soon as all the crust is gone he can start screaming because he knows he's got ribs he's got rid of all the crust now hold it just a minute they tell you not to be noisy you don't understand I was smothering yes sir yes sir Bobby said I heard him go he couldn't get a breath uh-huh cutting off the oxygen Nearly Dead and I've got back to the Rock beat my head till the crust has come off and you don't want me to be noisy right too bad too bad too bad too bad your screaming's gonna give me a headache well your whining has given me one or two along the way we're just trading out not your visitors haven't known you long enough to hear you whine read on so his youth is sure to be renewed so he can just let off the pressure and start screaming what he can let off the pressure and start screaming because he's going to be a young Eagle again that's wonderful I'm glad for the eagle I'm glad for that bird I'm glad for me hallelujah hallelujah one more but you know I know a rock where that we can go and be in prayer till all the crust of the world is beat away from us till all of the unbelief in God's word is feed away till we enter into a place where all things are possible Hallelujah and as soon as we get all the world and the unbelief in God's word beat off of us then we can Scream and Shout because eternal life is sure just as certain as anything certainly because all the world is beat off Hallelujah if you keep the world unto you keep loving the world and the things of the world you're sure to die yes but if you can get away from all of that then your youth will be restored you'll have eternal life so glad of that praise the Lord with me [Applause] paragraph 76 same message no a different different same title different City paragraph 76 letting off the pressure Green Lake Wisconsin the next one you have it you don't have that one let me read it to you it's very short and if he can't knock it off he dies but if he gets it knocked off he'll start rejoicing and screaming yeah you can hear him for Miles just screaming yes going to be renewed because he got the crust off yes got the cursed off Bobby said he got to see I think he might have gone back another time he said I I got to see one of those Eagles who had sat on that rock for days scraping his Talons not just beating the beak but scraping his talents until all those parasites were scraped off until those claws had broken off and new claws begin to form surely takes his beat once he's beat off all the calcium Bobby says he takes his his beak and begins to pluck out the bloody feathers you know some people they like for people to see what they've been through all the time so somebody can feel sorry for them but I just got to be honest none of us have time to feel sorry for each other because we're all going through the same stuff we have compassion we must have compassion we must have empathy we must be kind one to another but you can't be petted in this thing it's not a petting you need it's not a caressing you need it's somebody to scream at you all the way back to the top of the mountain don't stop you need somebody to say a little further you can do it commonly higher don't give up now we need that we need a coach somebody that'll kick us even a little bit not just and say don't stop now you've come too far you're so close now to the victory said as soon as this beak is cleared off then he's plucking those bloody feathers out throwing them over on the other side next thing you know like Samson Samson's new shock of hair new feathers begin to grow he begins to oil again Hallelujah anybody with me he begins to oil himself again he looked no wonder it's called renewing his youth got new feathers got a beautiful now now sharp uh Italians are sharp and everything's good Tacoma told Bobby that Eagles cry he said it's part of the oiling process and that he had observed for years healthy Eagles crying huge puddles of water and oil running out of their eyes and down their face to keep them clean and to keep them fresh keep them healthy but when that eagle is down in that moping period it loses its ability to self-oil and so therefore there's nothing coming out of those tear ducts to keep him fresh and and healthy but Bobby said I got to be there one day and I saw with my binoculars an eagle that had finished his course he had cleaned himself he had beat his head on the Rock he had got all the calcium off and the parasites out the new feathers had come and the oil was flowing again and he said I caught it in my binoculars as the biggest tears I'd ever seen huge puddles of of water and oil began to run down that that Eagles and he said he took his he took it as it would come down over his shoulder the top of his wing and he would rub it he used his wing to rub it all over him I've been in that kind of an anointing I've been in that kind of presence where I just wanted to bathe and bask in the presence of God and I'm not ashamed of it it it keeps life in US he said and I wasn't prepared for the screen he said I saw that that mouth come open and I heard a scream that reverberated Hallelujah down the sides of that Canyon wall all the way down there to the bottom where those Eagles were trying to get their street back and he let out an eagle scream oh you know what he was saying I made it I made it you can too I made it back to the wrong I found mine I found my hell I found my home I got back to the Rock caught whoa musicians are joining sister Laurel one more brother Greeley paragraph 55 is the eagle surgery oh you're not going to read another one yep one more as an eagle renews his youth yes sir the Revival takes and shakes all the old funny feelings away from you fly out into an atmosphere Yonder anybody in here got any old funny feelings hanging on any more frogs left anything hindering you you don't have to leave here today maybe you're sitting under the I don't even know about all this I don't even know if all this is so I don't even know if all this is real this this for all I know this could all be a big old put on I don't know what kind of old funny feeling you may have hanging around you but I know this he's got a help for you yes he does the rock is still in place oh Rock of Ages cleft for me let me hide myself in thee let the water and the blood from thy wound inside which flowed be for sin a double cure saved from Wrath and make me pure there's an atmosphere out there in the spirit yes where you can find your way out and away from all those funny feelings there's a rock to beat your head on and get all that stuff off from the the residual of the last season yeah like like like uh like Joshua with a high priest in Zechariah 3 was given a new Regal Festival to replace the old robe that was stained by Babylonian confusion right God took off that old turban on his head and gave him a clean turban changed his mindset start from the beginning Brethren read this again as an eagle renews his youth yes sir the Revival takes and shakes all the old funny feelings away from you thank God fly out into an atmosphere Yonder likened his Heritage to an eagle because the eagle renews his youth now makes him Shout I think you make some silent let me see if I can help you with that now makes them surely all of you are not in the Valley of the Wilderness at the same time what will we do if we all get down at the same time somebody's got to be out of it yeah somebody's gonna get out of me yeah somebody's got a shout right now make some Shout read on brother you watch the church it'll be sitting all dry first thing you know the Holy Spirit strikes them their youth Now read on why the old people is just up on their feet jumping and shouting and praising God renewsed our youth again that's right do anything a young person can do just jump and holler Scream and Shout hearing news is youth that's right I believe that don't you yes yes I believe it don't you yes I believe that I believe that you don't have to spend another night in the wilderness there's a rock to get to yeah let's stand hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah we don't want the Wilderness life we weren't born for that life we're not minimalizing your pain your Agony your struggles the lies the enemy it's all legit you really go through all that but what we're telling the church today is this you don't have to stay there you can choose your way out it's always to the Rock it's always back to where you were born back to your original experience back to the original Pentecost yeah isn't that what he told us you're not looking for a denomination to get a joint into we want the original Pentecost the one that fell on the day of Pentecost the one that gives a spirit life the one that restores us to who we are and the spiritual Amnesia is gone and we now remember who we were created to be and how we were created to worship yes that's worship it's worship Hallelujah Hallelujah if you've been in the wilderness you've got this chance to praise your way out of the wilderness you may be like one of those Eagles just climbing on your elbows singing the old FC Barnes song I'm coming up On The Rough Side of the Mountain I'm doing my best to make it home that's how you may feel today but at least you're not in the in the mopen valley at least you've got up a little way you're at least three feet six feet ten feet 20 feet above the wilderness making your way back to the wrong I hope I'm in the service when you struck The Rock I hope I get to be wherever you are when you get all that junk knocked off and you really give God the praise that he deserves let's Worship the Lord mommy my beloved into your embrace draw me my beloved let's come and worship let me look into your face [Music] especially if you feel like oh drugs nobody's going to try to push you or pull your prize [Music] beloved just in case [Music] it's my beloved [Music] I am here [Music] moving and again draw me my beloved [Music] it made me look into your face cause my beloved [Music] believe that God will lift you with him and Come Thou [Music] blow upon my garden that the spices May flow out it's my beloved it is [Music] won't you drop us [Music] into your embrace [Music] it made me look into your face [Music] Lord I want to fly out of this place draw me my beloved into your embrace [Music] [Music] touch your mouth touch him right now Lord you see what I need to get me out of this Valley see what I need to get me climbing again I need a wind of the spirit I need strength to eat what you've placed before me I need determination to get back to the wrong [Music] touch my life right now Jesus throw me my beloved into your ribs [Music] it made me look into your face cause my love is mine and I am his oh just draw me Glory [Music] and let me look into your face [Music] awake North winds sing it away [Music] blow upon my garden that the spices May flow out cause my beloved is for just draw me close one more time [Music] [Music] too strong [Music] play it we are under the dispensation of the flying eagle that fourth living creature was releasing a prophetic anointing that would not only draw profit into the heights but would draw prophetic people into the Heights brother Branham said that flying eagle anointing was a prophetic anointing and it would come to raise us up too many people read that and they say well that was him no no he was forerunning something every one of us who see the truth God is revealed to us this word it's it's it's our privilege to get up above to come into that why it doesn't say a walking lion it didn't say a talking man it didn't say a bellowing ox the only living creature that was given action was the eagle that's why the moving of the spirit is so important to stay in that flow and let the spirit move because it reminds us of what anointing we're carrying we're carrying the anointing of a flying eagle turn me up just a little bit so I turned to the left and I said how long will it take for these feathers to grow out and he said it comes in Cycles seven years 14 years 21 years 28 years and my mind began to ponder that in the experience because my life like your life whether we whether you've ever had time to think about it or not it lays in Cycles either 7 10 or 12. and you can go back over your life and Mark those and some some people have have all three Cycles significant things shifted in brother branham's life every seven years and then it later he mentions other numbers so I thought that's very profound I wish that it was a lot less time than that and as I thought that thought the one who was to my right spoke up and he laid his hand over on the bend of my arm this and leaned in and he said to me because the days are short there will come and acceleration in the regrowth of the feathers said Satan didn't mean only to debilitate the Eagles from flying he meant to kill them so I assume it was to keep him from The Rock but because the days are short there will now come an acceleration and we won't have to wait for our seven year cycle to get back to where we desire to be in Christ to get our feathers fresh [Music] grown out again the eagle has five primary feathers on the tips of its wings and when it's teaching it's young to fly it has the ability to rotate those five feathers only not the wings scientists say it's like a joint that's not a joint it's cartilage and there seems no explanation for it sometimes clockwise sometimes counterclockwise the eagle is able to rotate only those feathers and it creates because of his aerodynamic body it creates a centrifugal force there's a Hebrew word for it Nasha and that force is what pulls us back to Papa when that eagle is he's thrown the babies out of the nest they've learned to fly but they haven't learned to soar papa will take them out on on maneuvers exercises and they stay you know how we do those little ones stay as close to Mama or as close to Daddy as possible until they get to feeling their strength and sometimes mama will look down or papa will look down and see that the little eaglet has gotten a little too far for its experience it's not quite not quite experienced enough to be that far from Papa or Mama and you know what the eagle does mama or daddy just starts rotating those five primary feathers and it creates a centrifugal force and the Hebrew word is Nasha and it means to be pulled up and literally that little Eagle when it's got too far away when Mama does that that's centrifugal force pulls that Eagle right up under the chest of mama or daddy and they don't turn it loose until it's learned its lesson aren't you glad that when you're not in the valley you're flying you're doing well all of a sudden you get to thinking you can do it without Papa has anybody ever been there you didn't do it on purpose you didn't do it on purpose you just started stepping out without waiting on his instruction you just started doing things without him telling you to do you just got very used to this kind of leadership but it wasn't Holy Ghost leadership it was your human Spirit leading you and not Holy Spirit leading you and the next thing you know here's Papa nausea pulling you right back up under his bosom sing it again now you know what you're singing about draw me nausea [Music] [Music] and let me look into your face [Music] and I am [Music] to you you just tell the Lord your need right now while you're standing here father you see the Saints you have been so good to us this week we stand in your holy presence once again we are a needy people we don't have to tell you our need are trying to find language to describe it you see us Papa you see what's needed you see how we feel and where we are would you draw us would you draw us into your embrace would you draw us to your papa so that everything we have need of could be ministered to us right now by the spirit with no one even laying hands on us we're just pulling on El Shaddai we're just pulling on him right now the many breasted one the one who can do for us what we can't do for ourselves we're just pulling on him right now would you let your faith rise and would you let your voices raise right now as you call on him here I am Papa [Music] here I am I need your help I need your ministry right now [Music] May the spirit of the Lord just move over this house [Music] put your focus right on him May the spirit of the Lord [Music] move over this house right now Lord do for all of us what we can't do for ourselves [Music] it's time to serve him it's time to serve him if you're here and you're not serving the lord it's time to serve him now your destiny is to serve Christ [Music] Surrender Your Life Surrender Your hurts surrender your feelings come to Christ today give him everything if you're here and you're living a double life you've got secrets you've got things going on that you don't want anybody to know give it to Christ let him break the oak let him deliver you from it let him set you free from him it's not worth your soul it's not worth this hour missing God wants to accelerate your feather growth he wants to give you wings to soar in this hour he wants to break the old cycles of your life [Music] even the world recognize his Cycles psychologists talk about those cycles of an itch that comes in a marriage where there's a temptation to be unfaithful and it comes and it goes if that is something that works on you you can have victory over that you don't have to be tormented in your mind he can deliver you from that spirit so that you'll recognize the sanctity of your own marriage and you'll never want to stray again God don't listen that was for somebody you better take it you better take that I don't care what it is here to help us today I feel him sing it again son draw me draw me [Music] into your room I want you to look to the preachers [Music] [Music] come on [Music] remember [Music] [Music] and let me look into your face [Music] to take the service [Music] just blow upon my garden let the spices and may flow out cause my beloved is mine oh and I am here Lord just draw me close to you [Music] you're a place Draw Me by I've been loving and let me look into your face [Music] Draw Me Close once again [Music] into your every draw me my beloved and let me look into your face my beloved [Music] and I am peace draw me close to you Lord we allow you to draw us right up under you we don't want to get outside of your parameters Lord we don't want to get outside of your view we want you here to keep you [Music] Lord as we come to the conclusion of this meeting and we go to our homes and we're not in this kind of an atmosphere the corporate atmosphere night after night as we have been God I pray that we will remain with eyes and ears to hear what you are saying and what you are speaking to us Lord that we would be able to see the eye of the spirit leading us that we will not move outside of your plan God while some are still climbing Lord we prophesy strength
