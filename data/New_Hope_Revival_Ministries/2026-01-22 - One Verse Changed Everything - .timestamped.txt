[0:01] He said to this little lad, held him by
[0:04] the hand and and he said, "Suffer me
[0:07] that I MAY FEEL THE pillars whereupon
[0:11] the house standeth, that I may rest,
[0:14] that I may lean upon them." This little
[0:18] boy certainly played a small detail, but
[0:22] with a great prophetic weight in this
[0:23] story. Scripture gives only one verse to
[0:25] the lad. One verse
[0:28] changed the outcome.
[0:31] One verse made a difference in the
[0:33] future of an entire nation. There's no
[0:36] name, no title, no lineage, no record of
[0:41] his anointing, his calling, his God, his
[0:45] faith, his religion. NOBODY KNOWS. Yet
[0:47] without him, Samson never reaches the
[0:50] pillars. Without him, the Philistine
[0:52] system never collapses. Without him, the
[0:56] story ends in humiliation instead of
[0:59] deliverance. Without who? The lad.
[1:01] &gt;&gt; Somebody say the lad.
[1:02] &gt;&gt; The lad.
[1:03] &gt;&gt; God often hides his greatest end time
[1:06] instruments
[1:09] prophetically in small verses.
[1:13] Now I want to talk about for a moment
[1:14] who the lad is and who he's not. What
[1:17] the lad is not, he is not strong. He is
[1:20] not famous. He is not a judge. He is not
[1:24] anointed like Samson. He is not the
[1:26] chosen deliverer to begin the
[1:28] deliverance of Israel from the hands of
[1:30] the Philistines.
[1:32] &gt;&gt; But let me tell you what he is. He is
[1:34] available.
[1:36] &gt;&gt; He is obedient.
[1:38] &gt;&gt; He is aligned.
[1:41] &gt;&gt; He's strategically placed and he
[1:43] recognized something
[1:46] about Samson.
[1:49] HE KNEW SOMEHOW THAT WHATEVER HAD
[1:52] HAPPENED TO COST HIM HIS POWER.
[1:56] &gt;&gt; There had been a measurable CHANGE IN
[2:00] HIS DEMEANOR THESE LAST FEW WEEKS.
[2:03] &gt;&gt; And that little boy didn't want to miss
[2:04] it. I'm taking a little license.
[2:08] &gt;&gt; Forgive me. We all do.
[2:11] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T WANT TO MISS IT. SO HE WENT
[2:14] WITH HIM FROM THE PRISON HOUSE TO THE
[2:16] PLACE OF CELEBRATION
[2:19] AND HE WAS JUST WAITING ON ON an
[2:21] instruction
[2:23] placed right BESIDE HIM. GOD DOES NOT
[2:27] REQUIRE PROMINENCE
[2:29] TO POSITION SOMEONE PROPHETICALLY.
[2:34] ALL THAT IS NECESSARY TO BE POSITIONED
[2:36] PROPHETICALLY IS OBEDIENCE.
[2:40] This is a holy picture of a remnant
[2:43] bride church in the last days.
[2:47] &gt;&gt; A remnant church is overlooked.
[2:50] It's underestimated.
[2:52] It's unseleelebrated,
[2:54] but it's divinely positioned. There's a
[2:57] generational partnership that God is
[3:00] setting up right here in this hour with
[3:03] a generation
[3:06] that has seemingly passed their prime
[3:12] and a generation that is not yet stepped
[3:16] into the fullness of their why, the
[3:20] reason why they were born. And yet both
[3:23] generations
[3:25] represent something that we can't move
[3:28] forward without.
[3:31] &gt;&gt; We're stuck in history.
[3:34] We're doomed to repeat the mistakes of
[3:37] the generations before us. If we miss
[3:41] this opportunity to watch God FUSE
[3:45] TOGETHER THE WISDOM
[3:48] OF A GENERATION THAT CAME OUT UNDER
[3:51] MOSES
[3:54] &gt;&gt; AND A GENERATION THAT WILL GO IN. MY
[3:57] GOD, I felt that. Woo!
[3:59] &gt;&gt; Is a GENERATION THAT HAS BEEN THERE AND
[4:02] DONE THAT. A GENERATION who had wisdom.
[4:04] A generation who has experience. a Moses
[4:07] generation
[4:09] AND A JOSHUA GENERATION that's just
[4:12] emerging.
[4:14] &gt;&gt; I don't WANT YOU TO SPEND ONE MOMENT
[4:16] WORRIED ABOUT am I of THE MOSES
[4:18] GENERATION OR AM I OF the Joshua
[4:21] generation? Because remember JOSHUA
[4:24] HIMSELF
[4:26] was part of the Moses generation.
[4:31] &gt;&gt; JOSHUA AND CALEB,
[4:33] &gt;&gt; 12 WENT IN.
[4:35] &gt;&gt; YES. 12 came out,
[4:37] &gt;&gt; 10 came out with gripes.
[4:40] &gt;&gt; Two came out with grapes.
[4:44] &gt;&gt; God said, "I'm going to use those men."
[4:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:46] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO USE A JOSHUA. I'M GOING TO
[4:49] USE EVEN A CALEB.
[4:50] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[4:51] &gt;&gt; THEY were of a DIFFERENT SPIRIT. THEY
[4:53] WERE OF AN OLDER GENERATION, BUT THEY
[4:55] WERE OF A DIFFERENT SPIRIT.
[4:57] &gt;&gt; IF GOD SAID, "I'M GOING TO HAVE A
[4:59] MOUNTAIN," CALEB SAID, "I'M going to
[5:01] have A MOUNTAIN.
[5:02] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE IF I'M 80. I DON'T CARE IF
[5:05] I'M 90. I DON'T CARE IF I'M 100. IF GOD
[5:09] SAID HE'S GOING TO GIVE ME A MOUNTAIN,
[5:11] I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE UNTIL I GET MY
[5:13] MOUNTAIN.
[5:15] &gt;&gt; SO, don't you WORRY
[5:18] ABOUT WHICH generation you're in.
[5:20] &gt;&gt; SERVE GOD. DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO HELP
[5:24] THE synergy
[5:26] &gt;&gt; that is FORMING BETWEEN A MOSES, A
[5:29] PEOPLE WHO CAME OUT UNDER A MOSES
[5:30] ministry
[5:32] and a people who will go in
[5:36] &gt;&gt; under a Joshua ministry.
