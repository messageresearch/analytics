Kate is coming to sing will you give me pause just to read a scripture to you from Isaiah chapter 40 verse 25 to whom then will you liken me or shall I be equal saith the Holy One lift up your eyes on high and behold who hath created these things that bringeth out the host by their number he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might for he is strong in power not one falleth or faileth not one faileth as I was reading this scripture last night all of the sudden my mind went to the stars in the heavens he is the one who put them all in their place and gave them names and it says not one of them fails to shine their light and then I got to thinking about us lightbearers and we are a word sent from God and we will not return to him void and we have been sent here to shine light and as the stars of the heaven do not fail to give their light so I as one who has been set in the earth will not fail to give my light let's worship together as brother Cade comes to sing today [Music] all my life I have dreamed of something more something I've never seen there's a greater place that's waiting for me all my tears wiped away me and God face to face and I know that I am going to make it home when the road [Music] get you are more than enough and you are the rock the corner that I run to and everything is gone in the Stillness I can hear you say I'm on your side and when I'm all alone and everything's against me still I have a promise that will never depart from me as long as I'm alive you are on my side Al been blessed more than anyone can know but still I wonder why did you still go on a hill to take my place and die for me and oh but I don't have to cry every time there's a time that I feel that your moues away o cuz you're standing in the fire with me and when the road get around and you are more than enough and you are the rock the corner that I run to and everything is gone in the Stillness I can hear you say I'm on your side and when I'm all alone and everything's against me still I have a promise that will never depart from me as long as I'm alive you are on my side in the desert in the valley you are with me even on the Mountain High I've already won every battle for you are on my side in the desert in the valley you are with me even on the Mountain High I've already won every battle for you are on my side and you are the rock the Corner that I run to when everything is gone in the Stillness I can hear you say I on your side and when I'm all alone and everything's against me still I have a promise that will never depart from me as long as I'm alive you are all my side and you are the rock the corner that I run to and everything is gone the Stillness I can hear you say I'm on your side oh and when I'm all alone and everything's against me still I have a promise that will never departs from me as long as I'm alive you you are on my [Music] side and what can wash away my sin and nothing but the blood of [Music] Jesus and what can make be whole again it's nothing but the blood of Jesus no preious is of the love that Mak some me wi as and know Other M I know it's nothing but the blood of Jesus what can wash what can wash away my sin oh nothing but the blood of Jesus what can make me whole again nothing but the blood of Jes precious is the flow and all preious is the flow that makes me wi as no no other found I know but the blood nothing but the blood of Jesus it's nothing but the blood of [Music] Jesus my my [Music] my how many of you are thankful really really really thankful for the blood really really thankful for the blood and had it not been for Grace to get the blood to you this is why we hear the prophet saying sometime we're not saved by the blood but by Grace it's because there had to be an Avenue a vehicle to deliver the blood to your house to your life and that was the grace of God God salvation is not of Works lest any man should boast but it is the gift of God it's not based on obedience it's not based on Behavior it's based on his grace when you've been transformed by his grace then you want to behave like a Christian that's right like a child of God but you're going to fail and when you do you don't become unsaved aren't you glad of that praise God I I would have made a good Baptist because I've got enough uh Revelation from the word to know that he's not saving and unsaving and saving and unsaving our fellowship may change but our relationship with him Remains the Same if you believe that say Amen am uh we could just give all of these musicians a wonderful thank you for all that they do for [Applause] us please don't take this as a correction in any way but we'd like for you to join us as soon as you possibly can in the sanctuary this morning because I need you to help me I need you to pull on on the gift this morning I I really need his help I appreciate um every sacrifice that anybody makes to be in the house of the Lord I really do and I know that when you're out of town and you're enjoying your few minutes away it's hard sometime to to make your way back for a Sunday service where you know the pastor is going to preach two hours and and etc etc etc but I really do appreciate every sacrifice that these musicians make I don't always mention it but many times they uh cut a trip short or something just so that they can be with us and I appreciate that uh Kate had a little Hunting Expedition this week and and drove all the way home yesterday to be here I appreciate that I've seen all of them do it uh uh Josh has made big sacrifices and and Ben and Zach well all of them but I just appreciate it I want you to open your Bible today to uh I'm going to start in in John on I'm a little bit discombobulated and it's the it's the Lord's doing so we just have to trust him if if life discombobulates you well then that's one thing but if if God is the one rearranging things well then you just have to trust him right some of you aren't here in the right frame of mind but I want you to know I love you and I'm glad that you're here I wish wish that when you came you could come in the right frame of mind because we come to meet him but but I want you to know that I'd rather have you here all twisted than not to have you here at all and I'm going to believe that there's enough of us here who are uh uh pushing through and keeping our head above the water that we will pull you up a little bit today and I'm asking you sincerely to pull upon the gift of God this morning that he might speak to you because he has given me a word for this body and it's not necessarily going to be an easy word to deliver because it gets kind of to the nitty gritty it's not what I planned or prepared but for the third or fourth time in the last five or six weeks the Lord has dealt with me in the night on Saturday night and I wake up on Sunday morning and and and have nothing prepared for for what he's talking to me about and you'd think that as long as I've been preaching in as many notes as I have I could just go pull notes about any subject you know but it doesn't always work that way I know this is a word of the Lord to this house I know that only about 30% of you are prepared to hear it but I'm going to ask that the Lord prepare your heart uh for it because we're in a we're in a place I I sense it you do too we're in a place where we can't go on like we are that's not a bad thing we can't go on where we are we we we can't go on unless we're willing to pay a greater price brother brandom said you've gone as far with God as you're ever going to go until you're willing to pay a greater price and we know where the battle Lies come on now I know you're standing we know where the battle lies it lies up here and we're going to have to be a people who spew something besides doubt and fear and unbelief we're going to have to speak words of life into one another in this hour and we're going to have to consider that maybe in the moment we are only focusing on what we're going through but there's somebody that's going through something similar or even maybe a little bit darker and maybe they need somebody to talk to too I've always wanted to say a multiple times I've wanted to say to people that you know even preachers are people too even pastors are people too I I know that you know that by all my mistakes but I don't think you always know that when there's a trial but I want you to know that I I am depending on him he told me years ago he spoke clearly to me that he was my father and he is a father to the fatherless and a mother to the motherless that's who he is and uh when he spoke that to me I just screamed out I have no father but God and it loosed me from something that I'd been carrying for a long long time when God says I'll be your father I'll be your papa then then you you just lose all expectations to find that need met in the earth he meets from above isn't that right so let's turn to John I don't want you to be nervous I I I I'm not going to whip you much but but but I just am I'm just in a place where I I sent my notes and I said to charity I'm sending all this stuff it's not in order but I was able to at least get it on paper twice my notes and the projector notes and uh so they're going to have to pull around to try to find it all for instance I was supposed to start with Psalm but I'm going to start in John so uh pray an anointing on whoever runs the projector during the entirety of the service John 2 and verse 13 and the Jews Passover was at hand and Jesus went up to Jerusalem and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves and the Changers of money sitting and when he had made a scorge of small cords he drove them all out of the temple that's a whip and the sheep and The Oxen and poured out the Changers money and overthrew the tables I want you to know that these animals were not in the Holy place they were not in the inner chambers of the temple they were in the outer porches of the temple and it was not so unusual for them to be there on every Pilgrim Feast but they were getting closer and closer to that which is holy they were growing they were multiplying uh there were probably entrepreneurs who had had branched out and who had uh franchised their stands and instead of one location they had 10 or 15 and they were getting closer and closer to that which is holy and sacred with their exchanging and this was remember I want you to get this it was a service that was offered to the worshipper so that they didn't have to bring a sheep from the north or or bring a a flock of birds in a cage from the south they could bring their money they could come to Jerusalem because no one could come into the temple Compound on a feast day with empty hands he had to bring an offering and so they would buy the offering on location but this particular time they were again encroaching on sacred ground Jesus walks in and he sees them and he realizes that they're not only uh selling but they are they are taking advantage they're price gouging you know that really Burns me up when there's a hurricane and the hotels double and triple in prices you you ought to be cutting them in half to help people not gouge them but it's the ambition that that uh uh unregenerate ated men have to to gain even at someone else's expense so Jesus dealt with it he drove out uh he didn't say come get your sheep uh make sure you you you owners of The Oxen come and get them he just started driving them out it was going to be up to them to find their animals and he poured out the Changers money he didn't want the money he didn't need the money and he overthrew their tables I like the way the chosen has sort of dramatized that in our minds I can kind of see it playing out as I read he said unto them that sold doves take these things hint make not my father's house an House of merchandise and his disciples remembered that it was written the Zeal listen to this carefully it's the title of my message this morning the Zeal of thine house hath eaten me up that's a pretty heavy word from the psalmist David the Zeal of thine house hath eaten me up or some translations say and I must say do a better job by saying consume me I am consum assumed by the Zeal of your house it's all I think about it's all uh I care about the Zeal of the house of the Lord It's a powerful word for us Verse 18 then answered the Jews and said unto him what sign showest thou unto us seeing that thou doest these things things remember they're always looking for a sign not Gentiles they're worse about other things but the Jews were always looking for a sign show us a sign Jesus answered and said unto them destroy this Temple and in three days I will oh they they knew better than that then said the Jews for 6 years was this temple in building and wilt thou rear it up in 3 days you mean you're going to do in three days what it took 46 years to build to remodel under the leadership of Herod but he spake of the temple this is one of the most important messages that Jesus delivered in his ministry right this spake he of the Temple of his body he's speaking of his physical body but metaphorically and spiritually he's speaking of his spiritual body the church the overcoming bride of Jesus Christ when therefore he was risen from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them and they believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had said what about before he was raised from the dead what about before his crucifixion they didn't have a clue his talad his disciples they didn't have a clue about what he was speaking about until it had come to pass and evidently he didn't bother to explain it to them because sometimes you just long for people to get it if you get it because I persuade you it may not be with you when you need it but if you get it by Revelation it'll be with you in the good time and the bad time and the hard time and the easy time and you'll use it to defeat the enemy amen now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover in the feast day many believed in his name came when they saw the Miracles which he did he had every intention every intention of performing The Miraculous but before he could perform the miraculous he had to get the cheats out of the [Music] way he desired to perform the supernatural he desired to be a supernatural God among them but in order to do that he had to get the hypocrite he had to get the cheat the fudger you know what I mean some people don't want to think of themselves as lying even though they lie they they just call it fudging are you with me fudging just dressing it up a little bit I want you to know it's an integrity issue that's got to be dealt with if you've LED somebody to believe something that is not the truth God is going to hold you responsible for your deception I'm going to say it again if you have led somebody to believe something that is not the truth God is going to hold you respon well I can't help what they took from it on how many times do we walk away knowing that they have not got the message that we have been vague and have not fully communicated the reality of the situation you know I'm getting old enough now I'm going to stop doing that so I advise you to stay away from me except in church because I'm just going to quit uh fudging I'm just going to quit ignoring and looking like I don't know I'm if I know I'm going to say we really are going to have to come to a place where we quit enabling people to be cheaters we we're going to have to call it out sometime and that's not going to make us popular but it'll make us honest how many of you'd rather be honest than popular brother brandom said I'd rather be honest than popular father help us today I know that the tone has already been set but I didn't set the tone you did Lord in the night and I have come today uh with a lot of uh uh really of trepidation not really Desiring to deliver this in the intensity that it was given to me but I'm asking you to help me I'm reporting for Duty I said yes uh many many year nearly 50 years ago I said yes you said if if you open your mouth I'll feel it I have you have and now I have no reason to doubt you'll do the same today let it not be my opinion let it not be what I know in the natural but let it be the mind of the spirit today for this house and for those who are connected to this ministry and we'll give you glory and honor and praise for it's in the name above every name Yeshua salvation our Messiah the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the Saints said you may be seated if you need to go out plan your trips wisely stay out as little as you can come back and don't take your phone to the toilet that's nasty that's right put it in your pocket don't sit in there on your phone I I I've been on a journey to figure out why some folks in this church are sick all the time and I don't know what it is exactly but but I I would just maybe suggest that we be a little more clean get some hand sanitizer the real kind and do something about it and don't sit on your phone on Facebook or whatever you're on uh somebody did a little test the other day because someone had spent so much time in the bathroom they turned the light off and and it glows in the in the in the men's bathroom it glows because someone is sitting there on their phone now you you've got ouses at home I think water closets or something and this is not the place for that I don't mean to come across but I'm just telling you that we just going to have to quit fudging here amen it's not nap time John 2 I want to read 14-1 17 in the complete Jewish Bible and and it's the same place we just read but a little bit shorter version it says in the temple grounds he found those who were selling cattle sheep and pigeons and others who were sitting at tables exchanging money does anybody know why they would have had to have been exchanging money it's not because there would have been a lot of foreign uh money there but it's because there were certain offerings and and tributes that were paid with temple currency and so you would bring the shekele and you would would exchange it for temple currency and that's what you would be used for offerings or for certain tributes that were made at certain times of the year so they were exchanging their own currency for for a temple half shekele and I think there's one in that case out there perhaps from the time of Jesus uh a temple half shekele one that is mented for the temple by the temple so they were exchanging money they were selling sheep and cattle and uh Dove uh King James says Dove although the word is is a little bit more like pigeon but we know they're in the same family he made a whip from cords and drove them all out of the temple grounds not they weren't in the sanctuary and uh the sheep and the cattle as well he knocked over the money I just like it you know he just you know I don't think he just casually walked over and tipped him over I think for a few minutes he was behaving like a man from another world are you with me I think he just lost himself for a moment and uh really dealt with the business what would you do if your pastor just lost himself this morning and really dealt with the business well you wouldn't be here tonight I know that because we don't have church on Sunday night scattering their coins and then verse 16 and to the pigeon sellers he said get these things out of here multiple reasons one they carry disease and bird mites and they seem to poo more than they eat and it goes everywhere did I just say that in the pullit I did it's the truth at least I didn't call it what the Bible calls it at time uh so it it was a mess it's like my vehicle Parks under a certain tree and there's a there's a bird there that needs to change his diet because he hits me in the same spot all the time time and he and and it's not a little plop either I won't go into any more detail it's not a little plop it's it's a it was a mess and Jesus said get these things out of here how dare you turn my father's house into a market you've got Shooks you've got yard sails you've got jockey Lots you've got flea markets you've got white elephant sales you don't need to to make my father's house a a a many Market that's not what this place is about this is serious business his tadim that's disciples later recalled that the Tanakh that's the Old Testament says Zeal for your house will devour me until there's nothing left of who I am I want my ambition to be devoured and consumed I want my jealousy to be devoured and consumed I I want everything that is unlike him I want the Zeal for the house of the Lord and let me just say from the from the from the beginning here that we're not talking about this church building we're talking about what really makes up the Church of God what really makes up the elect Lady it's you and I we are the temple it's no longer a tent a tabernacle a mishcon it's no longer a a temple uh made of cedar a and of stone it's no longer just one one body the body the physical Earthly Temple of the Lord Jesus Christ but now we as a body corporate Believers we are the manifestation of the word for this last day we've been preaching that Jesus must have the preeminence Among Us he must have the preeminence in our individual lives he must have the preeminence in our corporate gathering in our mission statement in our ministry purpose it must be Jesus having the preeminence the full Focus the full attention because Deliverance can't come in the name of Shelly it can't come in the name of William bradam it can't come in the name of gy real Deliverance can only come in the name that is above everything name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's not enough to call his name it's not enough to announce his name it's not enough to enunciate his name it's the life it's the life behind the name that makes the demons tremble it's the life behind the name that makes a proud heart humble it was God who divised the plan that in all things as a man he would live so he could give give us the life give us the life give us the life behind the name are you with me there's go there's a BRI and that bride carries the life that's behind the name she she's not politically driven but she's not popularity driven she's not money focused come on now she's letting Jesus woo she's letting Jesus have the preeminence in all things she doesn't have time this little bride doesn't have time to keep up with everything that goes on in every other Church she doesn't have time to keep up with what's going on in the denominational Christianity we don't have time to keep up with those things we may we may pass and repass but she is word focused she is Jesus focused she has to be she's not pointing people to icons she's not pointing people to symbols she's not even pointing people to photographs because a photograph is no more than a painted image a a a printed image it's the life you're going to need that Pillar of Fire interacting in your life you don't just need to look at it on a photograph you need to carry it with you wherever you go come on and it's not his coming in a cloud that you need to be so excited about it's just coming in a cloud of witnesses when he comes with his bride we need to get ready for that we need to get Rapture Ready and Resurrection ready Hallelujah because he's coming he has come and he is coming oh praise God Jesus is coming he's coming for his bride then he's coming with his bride it's not all over Revelation 10 1 through 7 is not all over it's not all finished the angel of the Covenant is coming again to receive a bride the seventh seal is not a Rapture mystery it's a second coming mystery and we better get a hold of that because what's happening as I said last week we are putting everything in the past or somewhere off in the wild Blue Yonder future and we are missing like the people who are standing on Mountain Grandeur stepping on little individual Blades of grass bees buzzing around their head and butterflies floating through the air and fluffy clouds out on the horizon and they're saying where is God where is God where is God you're standing on him you're looking at at him you're surrounded by a Creator he's everywhere God is everywhere he has hidden himself to the church in Simplicity and he has now revealed himself to his bride in the same manner in the same manner not in complication not in complexity he has hidden and revealed himself how Church in Simplicity aren't you glad aren't you glad because that means you can get him you can know him you can have a revelation of who he is without a diploma without a degree you can know him in the in the fellowship of his suffering in the and in the power of of his resurrection Li and overcoming because he overcame because he overcame all of us are you helping me all of us are Overcomers because he overcame when you're dumping on each other do you ever consider someone's frame of mind before you tell them how rough things are at your address do you ever consider the fact that you're not the only one that has a strain or a stress or a heartache or a problem do you ever think about doing a wellness check on somebody before you tell them how dark it is how Bleak it is how your husband spoke to you so rudely how taking advantage of you are Miss understood you are how used you are do you ever think about the fact that you may be speaking to someone who is on the same precipice who is on the same Edge hear me now on the same Edge as you are they may be smiling more than you smile but that doesn't mean that they're not in a battle let me tell you something so what we ought to try to do is find a little litmus test that we can use spiritually to find out if this is a good time time to dump trauma dumping is better at the altar it doesn't mean that we can't talk about our situation with someone that we know someone that we are in relationship with we must be able to do that at times but we should do that with relationship that checks up on each other are you all right how are you you know how are things with you instead of vomiting trauma and uh you know I I I don't know why we have come to this place in our society where we think the only way we can encourage someone or help someone is to tell them where we have had the same problem can I tell you that that is not generally what people want to hear when they're in the throws of Despair is for you to tell how you've been through the same thing this is old counseling style and it's just not working in 2024 for you to always spend in fact people spend more time they ask you how you are and then they spend more time telling you all the struggles that they're walking through and how they've overcome blah blah blah blah blah and you're just sitting there sometime thinking so what come on be honest I'm just telling you what people say to me all the time people say to me all the time there are certain people I would never go to because they all they would do is spew how that reminds them of this and that reminds them of that and that reminds them of this trial and that reminds them of the other trial I want to tell you something I want to remind you of something from last week somebody sitting near where you are today is overcoming oh yes we're not all going under somebody in this house is rising above and it's only by the grave and the mercy of God woo you don't ever want to leave somebody in worse shape than you found them and the way to make sure of that is fill up your vocabulary with the truth of God's word and spew it like a fire hydrant that the truck is backed into you just spew words of life and words of Hope and words of encouragement you can make it I know you can like Cade was sing to us this morning you're the corner that I run to you're the rock that I'm anchored to come on that's why he's telling us you you must let him have preeminence debt can have preeminence your living conditions can have preeminence come on now your job situation can have preeminence your wicked family can't have preeminence hello your pet can't have preeminence Jesus has to have it Jesus has to have it who cheated you can't have preeminence how you got a lousy doctor that can't have preeminence there's only one thing that can have preeminence in the life of an overcoming believer and that's the goodness of God the mighty power of Jesus to deliver Hallelujah he didn't say I'll always take you out of the fiery furnace but he said I'll go with you I may not take you out of the Lion's Den but I'll shut the mouth of the lion I'll get my granny used to say he'll give the lion lock [Applause] jaw how many of you are glad he did and what a testimony came out of it what a testimony came out of it I I want you to know that there is a shoulder that you can lean on and when you walk away he you have never left him drained his battery isn't drained his gas tank isn't on empty you haven't leeched all the strength out of him come on there's a shoulder that you can on an everlasting arm that you can depend on there's a name that you can call on there's a place that you can bow your knee before the Lord and say I'm throwing myself on the Rock of Ages I might get broken but thank God he'll not have to crush me to powder because the Zeal of the house of the Lord not a building not a religion but the Zeal the passion the jealousy did you know in in in both Hebrew and Greek there are words in the Bible that can be translated both Zeal uh uh zealous and jealous zealous or jealous the same word remember I told you some weeks ago doing a little study on the difference between envy and jealousy I I I just didn't finish it but I will on some occasion finish it because I still hear people using and even myself sometime I find myself using the words wrong they're not completely interchangeably in the scripture interchangeable in the scripture most of the time when we describe a situation what we call jealousy is envy and jealousy is not always a bad thing the Lord is jealous right he's a jealous God but he's not evil he just wants your focus it's possible for you to be jealous over the things of God with a as zealous and not not be putting someone else down or or judging someone else's experience but you're just becoming consumed with a passion that says more than anything else I want to be a pillar in the house of the Lord I want to be a rock in the house of the Lord I want to be a beam in the house of the Lord I want I'd rather like the psalmist said be a doorkeeper oh you're going to give out of gas that quick I'd rather be a doorkeeper in the house of the Lord for one day than to dwell in the tents of evil of wickedness forever and ever and ever and ever Yeshua said I know you've been doing it I know this is not your first year but you're going unchecked and the more you're unchecked the more you you have no accountability you're getting closer and closer encroaching on that which is sacred on that which is holy your prices are not proportionate to what you're offering the people you are making my father's house a Marketplace a yard sale a junk sail and this is to be a House of Prayer it's a serious serious word that Jesus is giving us I'd like for you to go with me for a moment to s 69 I don't want to get too far away from where I am and there are 36 verses here I'd like to read them all but I don't know if I will or not I believe if I did you would be able to relate to some of these verses perhaps a description of how you're feeling at the moment might be be found in some of these verses so let me just start and see where we get this is Psalm 69 and it's to a chief musician whose name was shim which is a plural of of Shana I wanted you to know that because it's written by David and he is encouraging uh one of the Ministers of Music in the house of the Lord but it don't always sound like that he makes it pretty personal save me oh God for the waters are come in unto my soul most commentators believe that he was prophetically picking up on what the muse was going through and so even though he's saying it out of his own mouth he is very likely describing the condition of a fellow minister in the temple of the Lord save me oh God for the waters are come in unto my soul I sink in deep M where there is no standing I am come into deep Waters where the floods overflow me have you ever felt that way way hello anybody in here ever felt that way anybody felt that way this week I'm weary of my crying uh uh this is part of the problem people are too prideful too pompous I'm amazed sometime even in people's prayer requests how ppus they can be as though God is some little uh uh you know some little musician somewhere he said you know you piped unto me and I didn't dance I hear people say things sometime that make me think that their idea of God is that all he has to do is keep you happy listen he is not our Entertainer he's not our entertainment we can't sit on our behinds of do nothing and expect God to drop everything in our lap well I need a job that's not a way to ask me to pray that's not a way to ask your brother or sister to pray well I guess I need a job sure you need a job you don't have to be very spiritual to figure that one out you need a job because you need to eat you need a job because you had to have a wife and since you had to have a wife the least you can do is feed her and you can't feed her sure you need a job because you kept even though you found out what was causing it you couldn't stop it long enough to figure out how you were going to feed them and they have to eat so of course you need a job and you shouldn't have an attitude like it's God's big obligation on to come and give you a career because when we get desperate enough we get hungry enough we're going to beat the bush we're going to join president Trump in the Drive-Thru window of [Music] McDonald's who knows you may be the one to fix the ice cream machines nobody knows you you when you get in a situation of desperation like that you you start selling things things how do I know that because I've been there and so have some of you you don't you don't act as though God has nothing else to be concerned about you you don't make it as though it's his only concern and obligation to come and give you a get it just beat down the door I'll do the praying you do the application filling out it doesn't take take a genius to figure out God will always always always do his part but we're not going to be able to treat him like a bunch of children sitting in the marketplaces saying I piped into you and you didn't get up and dance every time I piped he is not your excuse to do nothing to be nothing sir he's not your he's not your lucky rabbit's foot he's not the Horseshoe over your door he's your father he's your papa he's your provider he's your helper he's your deliverer but he deserves to be treated with honor and respect and gratitude and Thanksgiving he don't need you and I beating on the auor telling him I paid my tithe are you kidding me I paid my tith so I'm expecting you he's not our puppet he doesn't work for us he's not our servant we're his there's a root there's a root that's got to be discovered in this hour there's a root because the Zeal of thine house is supposed to be consuming this little bride in this hour it's the cleansing of the temple of God it has to come now it has to come in this hour and we can't put it off any longer we can't wait until another dispensation because this is the finality of all things the bride is already reaching into the bright age while the church is suffering the last few hours of leod deia there's never been a more appropriate time an expedient time than the time right now to be consumed by the Zeal of the house of the Lord the passion to be a temple that God can live in I'm weary of my crying my throat is dried my eyes fail while I wait for my it's not fair we're raising children who think just like they're doing that's what what disturbs me so much is is woke Society has infiltrated the church and it has also infiltrated the message Church and people are afraid of you know if we if we get it real straight or say it real straight or preach it real straight we're going to hurt somebody's feelings it's perfect love we're coming to that means mature love you're going to need to be able to handle a little correction if you're going to manifest perfect love hello there's an hour we're living in an hour now where it's not petted we don't need to petted we sometimes need to be prodded but we don't really need to be petted we need somebody to shake us up to the reality that we are exactly who we choose to be if you're defeated you've chosen to be defeated am I out of the word am I out of the message the greatest battle ever fought right up here we know what God's word said but we're still trying to reason it out we're still trying to figure it out somebody said I don't understand why it's not working for me yes you do you know exactly why it's not working for you because you won't sell out you won't completely sell out you've got bones in your closet that you've never dealt with and you claim to have a zeal for the house of the Lord and God said it's not going to work you've left people with the impression that you're innocent When You're Not Innocent you've been dishonest you've not moved with Integrity you have absolutely doctored the details so many times until you don't even know what really really happened and we're wondering why we're not moving in perfect love and perfect faith in perfect power with God's Authority the Zeal of thine house hath eaten me up and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen on [Music] me that's verse nine verse four they hate me they that Hate Me Without a Cause are more than the hairs of mine head they that would destroy me being mine enemies wrongfully are Mighty then I restored that which I took not away oh God thou knowest I love the honesty thou knowest my foolishness you know that I have sat down when I ought to have been putting my shoulder to the plow I have been foolish waiting on you to do what I needed to be doing myself teaching my family family that God must fail when things don't roll out for us like a red carpet that's not helping anybody let me tell you something God will always help those who cannot help themselves don't you ever forget that he will like I said a moment ago a motherless he'll be a mother to the motherless and a father to the fatherless and a Healer to the sick who can't do anything about his sickness but there comes a time that God said I'm tired of being your lucky a charm how many times did he send prophets to Israel to say to them you are spoiled you are spoiled rotten you're the apple of my eye but you are so rotten because you treat me like a worn out sandal they that Hate Me Without a Cause are more than the hairs of mine head they that would destroy me being mine enemies wrongfully are Mighty then I restored that which I took not away go back the psalmist has said I've had to try to fix what other people have done and they come out smelling like a rose and the reproach has fallen on my head for things that I was powerless against come on have you ever felt that way have you ever felt judged for what somebody else was doing for the playground that everybody else was making making David felt that way evidently so did the musician oh God thou knowest my foolishness and my sins are not hid from Thee I love the fact that he didn't say my mistakes my little shortcomings my little foxes my unbelief my sins there's no reason to try to fool you Lord right you already know you know my envyings you know my jealousies you know my resentments you know what I say about my pastor and his family come on yes he knows tell him anyway that way you're not excusing yourself you're getting it out in the open you've entertained things that you should not have entertained right the Lord warned me sitting in my Den some months ago I said to my wife I see an attack of the enemy coming against our family because of envying and jealousy we've done nothing to deserve this kind of an attack but it just will not die die you being honest if I have a holiday somebody's got something to say about it if I have a pair of shoes somebody's got something to say about it if my child has a new phone somebody's got something to say about it do you know what that lets me know when we get to that place we've got too much time on our hands am we need to be consumed I'm not defending my family they're they're far from perfect far far far from perfect but you will do better to get your eyes off of them and let the Zeal of the house of the Lord consume you amen I told my wife I told my family some of them I don't know how this is going to manifest has something to do with the baby I don't know how this is going to come about but I'm deeply concerned about it I didn't sleep good for days about it I just somehow came to a place where I knew that only God could take care of it and he did his Mercy his grace God is Sovereign he could have stopped it don't you think the devil did it on his own accord and it was just all him and God just you know didn't know it was happening he allows it because he wants us to learn that the enemy will hijack the plans and timings of the Lord for reasons and purposes that we won't understand until the victory comes God was faithful in every part of it but that kind of a spirit will not destroy us it'll destroy you that's right it won't destroy the one you envy or the one you're jealous of it will destroy Dy you the one that you refuse to forgive that unforgiveness will not destroy the object of your unforgiveness it'll be like acid it'll work to destroy you are you angry this morning the Zeal you wonder what's wrong with me the Zeal of thine house hath eaten me up I've tried to walk with you through the valley of the shadow of death I've tried to be everything that I possibly could be during one of The Darkest Hours of this ministry but I need to tell you that you didn't get a p and there's going to be times when I must come to you with a word from the Lord that says yes I acknowledge your pain I acknowledge your heartbreak I acknowledge what you're going through but the Lord is saying I'm calling you to come up to to come up to come up to come up to come up to get above will we be overwhelmed yes will it come in waves yes will anger be a part of it yes will we blame ourselves at times yes will we blame others at times yes but we must we must must choose we must grieve but we must choose not to be consumed right by our grief that's right we must not be eaten up with our anger with the selfishness of what we're walking through it will eat you up it'll make you bitter it'll cause you to miss what God's trying to use these dark terrible circumstances for he wants to win a victory in your life he wants to win a battle through you come on he wants to do something for you exceedingly and abundantly above what you could even imagine he is a restorer and not only a restorer he said but I will give restitution when the thief is caught in the act God said I'll demand I I'll demand I'll make sure that he doesn't just give back what he sto he'll have to do it over and over and over and over again come on come on come on but you'll never come to that place if Envy is consuming you if resentment is consuming you if blame game is consuming you if the first thing you do every morning is wake up to see what social media has to say about it you're being consumed by it make up your mind that you're going to be consumed by something else not because turkey day is coming that's right when we go through things like this it's those it's those birthdays it's those anniversaries it's those firsts it's all those things that rise up to try to smack us we're human you don't have to be directly involved to be involved you don't have to be directly impacted to be impacted You Don't Have To Be Blood kin or legal kin to feel the pain but God is setting examples Among Us let me let me read it to you see if you can recognize this they that Hate Me Without a Cause are more than the hairs of mine head you're missing a few there in the front Joe they that would destroy me being mine enemies wrongfully are Mighty then I had to restore what I had not taken away carry the blame and the guilt well-worded little memes and junk because some people can't find a life in the midst of all of this suffering some people have to go back to work and it's the strength of the Lord and the grace of the Lord that's setting such an example before us and we can't do any less we must not do any less we cannot afford to do any less than what we see modeled in front of us we must press we must find a place of zeal for the Lord uh come on now we must determine to be faithful to God to his house to the truth we we might need to go through and clean out some junks I sound like a missionary putting an s on everything please remove all gums from your mouth that's hard to do let not them that wait on me oh Lord on thee let not them that wait on thee Oh Lord God of hosts be ashame for my sake let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake oh god of Israel because for thy sake I have borne the reproach shame hath covered my face I am become a stranger unto my brethren and an alien unto my mother's children for the Zeal of thine house for the Zeal of thine house house hath eaten me up and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are Fallen upon me if anybody could have given this testimony it was David his father not Earthly father but example his mentor had lured him with his own jealousies come on he's paying a price that he didn't he had nothing to do with right it's falling on David are you still awake I am become a stranger for the Zeal let me get that verse again for the Zeal of thine house hath eaten me up and the reproaches of them that reproach thee are Fallen upon me there is no Temple it hadn't come yet let not them that wait on thee Oh Lord God of hosts be ashamed let me I'm I'm sorry I'm I'm I'm everywhere uh let's move on uh verse uh 10 when I wept and chasen my soul with fasting that was to my reproach I made sackcloth also my garment and I became a proverb to them see you can't please you can't please some folk if you put on sackcloth and ases that wouldn't please some folk if you get up and wash your face and go back to work that wouldn't please some folk what they that sit in the Gat speak against me and I was I was the song of the drunkers boy you know you're in a bad place when the drunks are singing about you I don't even know the drunks in there're singing about me but ask for me my prayer oh yeah is under thee Oh Lord in an acceptable time oh God in the multitude of thy mercy hear me in the truth of thy yesu thy salvation deliver me out of the m and let me not sink let me be delivered from them that hate me and out of the deep Waters come on come on let not the water flood overflow me neither let the Deep swallow me up and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me you ever felt that way hear me oh lord for thy loving kindness is good turn unto me according to the multitude of thy Tender Mercies and hide not thy face listen praise God he's going on longer about the goodness of God and giving it over to God then he went on about his own heartache hide not thy face from thy servant for I in trouble hear me speedily draw nigh into my soul and redeem it deliver me because of my enemies uh thou Hast known my reproach and my shame and my dishonor my adversaries are all before thee reproach hath broken my heart and I'm full of heaviness and I look for to take pity but there was none and for comforters I found none because everybody had their own stuff it's not always because you're not loved I'm always amazed at how people who have raise their children forget what it was like to raise children it's so easy for grandmas to criticize young mothers maybe you had Maids my mother was raised by maid she was so rotten she said that she'd go downtown and walk as far as she could walk and then sit down on the sidewalk and she'd say little girl I'm not walking another step till somebody picks me up everybody doesn't have a privileged life like that she certainly paid for it later everybody didn't have a maid running around to help Mama take care of you it's easy to forget what it's really like when you're on the other side you people that get so twisty in church because a a child has cried or someone has made a sound a little baby a squeaked someone has tugged you or rolled a car between your ankles you must have forgotten what it was like we need to show a little Mercy the reality is I'd rather have a a a house full of noisy children that I know are going to be raised now some of them need a spanking when I see a parent stand off and watch a child misbehave and they Snicker when I see that I think there's two weapons needed here why don't I just start with Mom and Dad I told a young teenager not too long ago the next time I hear you using language that you've used language like that I'm coming over here with a bar of soap and I'm going to wash your mouth out with soap and you're going to let me because I love you and you know it sometime somebody that's a little bit outside has to just step up and say I know you're frustrated I know you're hurting I know you're angry I know you've been through some stuff but I don't know anybody that hadn't been through some stuff and just because you've been through some stuff doesn't entitle you to live like a [Music] heathen some people feel so sorry for their children having to be raised without a Christmas tree or without some of the things that the world is so crazy about that you want to give them all the things that they don't need you involve them in things that cause them to miss church and then you wonder then you wonder where am I I didn't find any have you ever needed but there wasn't [Music] none what did you do did you eat worms or did you say I'm going to throw myself on the mercy of a living God I'm not going to look for a way out I'm going to look for a way over because he's a way maker he didn't take Daniel out he didn't take Shadrach meach AB bed to go out but didn't go through it by themselves he could have picked up two million people and put them on the other side of the Red Sea but instead he parted the waters went right through it this didn't come to stay it came to pass come on let's go on they gave me also Gall for my meat now he he he's he's prophetic again in and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink let their table become a snare before them and that which should have been for their welfare let it become a trap Oh My My My let their eyes be darkened that they see not and make their loins continually to shake somebody stirred pour out thine indignation upon them I don't have anybody to feel sorry for me so I'm going to call on the Lord and I'm going to believe him to fight my battle he's going to be the one to respond come on don't matter what I tell him to do he's only going to do what he knows to do and needs to do woo come on pray for them pour out thine unending Nation upon them and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them let their habitation be desolate and let none dwell in their tents for they persecute him who thou Hast smitten as Christ and they talk to the grief of Those whom thou Hast wounded come on and iniquity to their iniquity and let them not come into thy righteousness there's going to be a price to be paid for rejecting Messiah let them be blotted out of the book of the living and not be written with the righteous ser ious business but I am poor and sorrowful let thy salvation oh God set me up on high I will praise the name of God with a song and will Magnify Him with Thanksgiving oh I see a man who goes from dark to light am who goes from a need to have Vengeance to a need to glorify God for his faithfulness you're not so unlike David in this I'm not so unlike David in this God sees what we're going through this also shall please the Lord better than an ox or a bullet that hath horns and hoofs the humble shall see this and be glad and your heart shall live that seek God for the Lord heareth the poor and despiseth not his prisoners let the Heaven and Earth Praise Him the Seas and everything that moveth therein for God Will Save Zion and will build the cities of Judah that they may dwell there and have it in possession come on I'm believing the seed also of his servant shall inherit it and they that love his name shall dwell therein praise the name of the Lord the word zeal there the Zeal of the house of the Lord it means order it comes from you know we say Adam Adam it means red Earth we take this word and we see that it talks about produ a color produced in face by Deep emotion ardor Zeal jealousy a jealous anger the Zeal of the Lord a jealous anger the Zeal of the house of the Lord a jealous anger to become dark red has anybody ever become dark red when they thought about what they could have I'm fixed to preach you're fixed to sleep it seems but I'm fixed to talk to you a little more here the Zeal of the Lord's House makes my face red it becomes jealous anger because we're not fighting for a building that's right we're fighting for a building this eaten me up it comes from a word akal which means to eat to devour to consume to burn up to feed it reminded me of something RJ said last Sunday uh uh concerning the the burnt offering it is regularly used in a metaphorical sense of describing the activity of fire that consumes or devours the burnt offering was consumed by fire in into ashes the fire ate up the sacrifice the Zeal the jealous anger that we should carry for this house to build him the right house to clean up the temple where we're asking him to live in it should overwhelm us it should sometimes turn our face red it should disturb our peace sometime it should eat us up like a fire burning in our bones like Jeremiah said Jesus was cleaning an Earthly Temple a and the Zeal that he had was to preserve the temple but it was more than that because he said I will tear it down and in three days raise it up this refers to his not the house but the house stay with me not the house but the house and this Zeal of the house of the Lord must also overwhelm us overtake us consume us we don't have time to see how far down the pin when in the slit we don't have time to examine someone else we don't have time to worry what everybody else is doing because we're consumed with the Zeal to build a house for the Lord to live in to dwell in your passion can't be self perservation your passion has to be Kingdom I've got to build the kingdom I've got to establish the kingdom and it doesn't start out it starts in I can't help build up the kingdom of God until I become a surrendered Kingdom I can't help others find a place where he has dominion over them until I can find the place I want you to put punch your neighbor in love 1 Corinthians 6:19 and 20 I've got another hour some of you are not going to help anyway what know you not that your body not the church house on your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which ye have of God and ye are not your own for you are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are Gods I'm going to make this quotation from the church age book although I can't find brother brandham saying this verse of scripture anywhere in the message of the hour it was used in the church age book well he said be zealous and repent now this false church has Zeal make no mistake about that her Zeal has literally been that of the Jews John 2:17 the Zeal of thine house hath eaten me up but it is a wrong Zeal it is for the house of their own building that's right they're consumed in building a a house of clay of stone of wood they're they're consumed with rebuilding an Earthly temple they're consume but this is a false Zeal the most important Zeal to have is one for this house of the Lord somebody said that seems selfish no you you're not trying to to build up yourself for prideful reason you're trying to give him a house to live in one that's sold out one that's surrendered one that's obedient one that doesn't have time to criticize other folk be jealous of somebody else's suit it is for their own Creeds dogmas organizations their own righteousness they've put the word out for their own ideas they deposited the holy ghost that they deposed the Holy Ghost and made men into leaders they have put aside eternal life as a person and make it good works or even Church Conformity rather than good works but God is calling God is calling for another Zeal it is a Zeal to cry I want to hear you I am wrong I am wrong I've let everything else consume me I've wallowed in my pity I've desired sympathy but I'm wrong I need to be consumed eaten alive with a Zeal to make God a house Lord what is it that all these denominations are based on the claim that they are right now they all cannot be right in fact not one of them is right they're whed supplers full of dead men's bones they have no life they have no Vindication God has never made himself known in any organization they say they're right because they're the ones that are saying it but saying it does not make it so it works the same way in there in those little carefully crafted denominational non- denominations formed around the message they choose out their top 10 preachers they make their own little non-denominational denomination they support each other's Youth Camp and youth banquet while deciding that no one in that's outside of their Circle has the word we're the only ones that have the word one preacher just recently said why they don't have the word there did you know they let the gifts operate on the floor brother brandom said I don't want to be guilty of preaching anything other than what Paul preached they need the vindicat thus sayith the Lord of God and they don't have it right I hear them sometime not not just denominations but non-denominational denominations I hear them sometimes talking about thus sayeth the Lord as though brother brandham had some kind of exclusive right to both the phrase and the action when in reality he said we shouldn't just say that but he said that little bride she will have thus saith the Lord and if she doesn't have that she will keep still well since brother brandom is no longer here to give us thus sayth the Lord we're going to have to depend on a supernatural God hello hello [Music] hello in the message the Queen of Sheba and I'm going to have to stop before too long because I'm think I'm you're losing uh uh the point in paragraph 67 he said but the thing of it is they they take the nation the things of the world who will be who will play this play with certain certain movie star a lot of people many people today church members Pentecostal people Baptist Presbyterians can tell you more about the movie Life on hello hello they can tell you more about the movie life than they can the Bible life they can tell you more about the movie life than the Bible life watch this more children can tell you about David Crockett forgive me you've got to understand that this was preached in 1960 today it would be Pokemon and Disney and I mean the hour has come that they have to include lesbians in cartoons so that everyone feels included my wouldn't it be wonderful to see an old uh Davey Crockett one more time when the world is so suckered or or even an old gunm smoke or some of them that but remember that's what that's what they had then brother Brandon was so upset he was so disturbed about I Love Lucy he could hardly sleep at night preaching over against I Love Lucy I'm just guessing in my mind that he must have seen he saw her with her cigarette in her mouth and her hot pants on and he must have seen and her ruby red lips and he must have seen that there was going to come a time that any decent person would have to fast forward something because they wouldn't show a peck on the cheek my goodness and when I was a little boy familyes on television the mom and dad slept in single beds Dennis the Menace and some of these shows that came on Mom and Dad each had a twin bed on the other side of the room so that no child would wonder how they got here and if they ask a St did it where are we now oh they know more about daav Crockett or Gunsmoke or or we could say today Disney and Marvel and all of the or some of them that that then they can about Jesus Christ is because that's what they're taught that's what they're taught that's what they're taught that's what they're taught that's what they're taught that's what they're taught in their homes you want me to do what you won't do and then talk about juvenile delinquency or it's quiet it's parent delinquency it's parent delinquency and church delinquency he said that's exactly right clergy delinquency of preaching the word and God working with the church confirming the word with sign following the preachers just won't preach it ananas and Safara living in the church on the side of the church and never called out all the while folks are lying to the Holy Ghost on well Pastor was just exaggerating it really wasn't that bad it was bad it was bad yeah you can tell that that if you want to but it was bad some of these things we're still recovering from ananas and Safara living in the church on the side of the church never called out and told their sins because they're the heaviest payers there is in the church some ananas with a great job can put $5,000 a year he could drink smoke gamble commit adultery and he can be deacon at the same time I struggle sometime to find a deacon because one of the requirements of a deacon is a a man that runs his household like it ought to be run who has authority over his wife and children that's what I'm struggling with but the church is got so bad they've got to have deacons so bad that they'll find the one giving the most money make him a deacon and not preach against his sin brother I'm telling you when the spirit of God comes into the church and tear the thing open and rip it out like he did when he come the other time to the temple money changers lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God truce Breakers false accusers in continent despisers of those that are good he High minded having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away I'm quoting the scripture First Timothy 3 I hear them out there every now and again they say something to young people about skinny jeans we ought not to even have to say that that's right I heard that brother there from British Columbia preaching in Texas and heard him talk about it he said we dealt with it in my day he said you young people think skinny jeans is a new thing he said I used to see my brother get in the bathtub with hot water with his jeans on this man's not young of course he's had white hair for over 20 something years but he's not a young man and he's so he's going way back to his young days brother would get in the in the hot tub with his jeans on so they'd shrink up just right so they could be tight enough to wear I I thought that was I thought skinny jeans were kind of a new gay trend that had taken over the church I didn't know that it goes way back I knew they used to like to roll their cigarettes up in the sleeve of their white T-shirt I knew that but I didn't know that they would shrink them in the listen what you ought to know about something like that is it's a spirit and it manifests itself different ways for different days but it's the same kind of a spirit right it's the same spirit that make a uh one of you sisters do something Mighty strange with your hair at certain times going through certain things let me tell you something because you're going through something that that that ought not to make you want to go to church with bedroom hair I I have sometimes you just feel like you have to part somebody's hair to talk to them Spirit gets on folks but the reality is folks the problem is so much deeper than a short skirt it's so much deeper than that so if all we do is preach against those little things like some people want you to do if all we do is just preach against that and we don't ever talk about the deeper issue that that causes us to yield to those kinds of spirits we're we're always going to be cheaters and fudgers and and and the Zeal of the house of the Lord is going to leave us we're going to be worried about fixing somebody else's church and not worried about fixing our church come on when you see those things taking place in those hour We're living the sincerity the church ought to be in yet just fabulous you go down here at the market or go tonight for dinner watch this and they set you out a bowl of soup and a big spids in it well some of you'd scream no names some of you wouldn't be like the little missionary lady they said dear husband said deer there's a fly in your soup they were missionaries they lived on the field for ever they come home Furlow and he said dear there's a fly in your soup she said oh he said you used to really get upset about bugs she said well we're missionaries now and he won't eat much the fly the fly no wonder you're not getting me she said oh don't worry about it he won't eat much you got it now the fly you go down to the place get you a bowl of soup a big spider in it well you want to sue the company certainly a fly is in it you would why you'd call the waitress and ball her out like everything and yet you'll walk right around and take some man-made Theology and push it down your throat join the church and that's all you have to do come on come on wouldn't eat a bowl of soup that a spider was in but swallow lies in the name of God except a man be born again he can no wise enter is that the word can no wise enter the kingdom there signs these signs will follow them after they're born again see that's what Jesus said that brings the mark of Distinction to the church the signs and wonders of the resurrected living Christ Living in the church he said they don't want it today that's simply because they're not consumed with the Zeal of the house of the Lord I'll have to take this up another time but I'll take a few more minutes I want to tell you what he said the time has come to cleanse the temple of God it's not the Refuge it's not the it's not the land it's not the house it's us he's been working on us now for a long time he's not through with us yet he can't accomplish in us what he desires to accomplish in us if we keep making excuses for where we are is that right are you with me now for a few more moments I'm going to say some uncomfortable things there's been at least four times that this church has been tested and tried as a faith family as a church body things that could have easily destroyed us there have been many battles and some Wars there would be too numerous to name but the spirit of God highlighted to me last night four four things we had a church split in 1997 it was vicious it was sad it was vile sometimes newcomers ask us to describe it and we I I I lack the words I lack the vocabulary I don't even know how to tell you what happened happened I just know it happened it was a spirit got a hold of a woman who like me needed her Temple cleaned but instead she yielded to a spirit it was jealousy it was envy and it worked its way through a family splitting a church it was devastating it was hard days many of us wanted to die we felt betrayed we felt forsaken we felt scrutinized and no one could give us answers we're living it and no one could even tell us what was really going on how you can be a friend one moment and a mortal enemy the next how you can go from a deacon saying I'll punch anybody in the face that crosses you brother Shelly because you're God's man who later getting under the influence of that spirit and saying I have a gun in my automobile and I would gladly shoot him I'll just say it that way but it would be too quick I'd rather watch him suffer someone said what is the accusation that would cause you to be so mad that you'd want to shoot somebody he said he just doesn't have any fruit of the spirit in his life normal folk don't talk like that you don't say I want to kill somebody because you don't have no fruit of the spirit when you're wanting to kill somebody only Devils talk only Spirits only demons talk like that come on folks sane men and women don't talk like that we watch that same Spirit come two other times to try to destroy this church both of those times through men and their influence God was gracious his Mercy his grace his goodness brought us through it was a test and there were times that we were losing and failing it and there were times that we were passing it but we can now on the other side of it say it was his grace and mercy who brought us through some years later we were tested on issues like marriage and divorce troubled me so deeply all we can say is what the word says that's all we can say but God finally gave peace by saying it's a test and you've got to come through it you've got to pass this test ultimately God is the judge and you would be an ostrich with your head in the sand to say that it hasn't been a tremendous help to a family unbelievable in God's hands I said I I couldn't come to a wedding but when it's over if you need a place to go to church we're here how could I say that went against everything I I stood for when the Lord said it's a test I'm going to see how you come through it well he already knew you know then I knew that's what I had to do was quite criticized at times still misunderstood along the way about it but it's all right it's in God's hands and then in 2014 we came through one of the darkest times there was a financial breach and a betrayal in our church in many ways in most most ways we have come through it and recovered but there are still some times that it affects some of us but God's grace and mercy brought us through the 97 brought us through the other brought us through the 2014 I think it's when I hear rumors that people sometimes say behind my back it wasn't as bad as he said he exaggerated it I think those are the times that it knocks the wind out of me because that's simply not the truth but it was God's grace and mercy that brought us through marriage intact life moves on God is good could have killed us but it didn't and then recently never in a million years did I ever think that we would have someone in our community to leave us so unexpected and at their own hand never expected it's in these times when even prophetic people feel very unprop more pathetic than prophetic but God's grace and mercy brings us through love shines Jesus shines people rise to the top St they keep pressing in holding up their head because God's grace and mercy gets us through is that right I'm almost done is that right but don't ever think that we've done it because we had good leadership in the natural it's only because our Captain thank Lord has led us hallelujah thank you Lord hallelujah he has he does he still is but if we've done one thing right if we've got anything right it's this Colossians chapter 2 Verse 18 and 19 let no man begal you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshiping of angels intruding into those things which he hath not seen vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind and not holding the head nobody cares about your dream your vision your word your prophecy your feeling your unction your inspiration your if you're not holding to his head nobody cares about your praise your amen your sermonette your anointed song If you're not holding to his head am anybody with me it's only by holding to his head that we can keep our head above the Waters of life it's only by holding to his head that we can keep our heads above the fanaticism that surrounds the leodan message the message sent to this church age it's only by grace and mercy and holding on to Christ the head from which all the body by joints and bands having Nour nment ministered and knit together increaseth oh Hallelujah with the increase of God if you turn loose of his head you've lost nobody can hold his head for you nobody can hold on to him for you it's only when you realize that he is holding you that's why you can hold him if he were to ever Turn You Loose you don't possess enough Faith to hold on to him so what is it that brought us through many dangers and troubles and trial Grace Grace somebody say grace it's only Grace I need I need some more water nearly done in 2010 I had an experience with four angels all the fans of my dreams and Visions who like to mock us will certainly enjoy this one the only rebuke I got over this experience was from brother Perry green he rebuked me because he came to a conference where where while I was sharing it and I said it was an experience and when I was speaking at his church I said it was a dream and he said brother Shelley you dumbed that down for message folks didn't you I said yes he said I would have rather you just said it was an experience cuz when I heard it I knew it was I saw four Angels coming toward me and I knew that they were coming to help me with some sort of assignment or task that I had been given in the spirit and as they drew closer one of them spoke to me and said we have come to help you with your very serious assignment and you in turn must help others I quickly asked what the nature of the assignment was another of the Angels answered by saying we are here to help you to hold to the Lord's head I said I'm not sure what you mean the third Angel explained that the bride must hold fast to the Lord's head like never before I said how will we do this and the first angel said in hope the second angel said in honor yes the third angel said in Holiness and the fourth angel said in humility each Angel then proceeded to give simple instructions on how we would carry out the assignment God said I'm going to restore hope where hope has been deferred or where hope has been lost I'm going to give my people Faith to hope against hope to hold on to my head even when it looks hopeless when there seems to be no hope they're going to hold on to me in hope in honor I'm going to bring both favor and promotion to my bride it's time to bring honor home to make it personal not just with lip service but with our hearts it's hard to honor somebody when you're so jealous and so envious of them you can hardly stand it you watch every move they make it's a time to honor those that the Lord has connected us with and follow their example and I I'm not going to preach this message I'm looking through the sermon notes thirdly in holiness and he gave me Exodus 19-6 and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests a holy nation consecrated set apart to the worship of God these are the words you shall speak to the Israelites it's through Holiness it's not through worldliness it's not through compromise it's through Holiness that we can hold on to him and fourthly humility not proud or hoty not pretentious unassuming sometimes almost insignificant did you know brother brandom said sometimes you could be too humble and the enemy will run you all over town sometimes youve got to Plat your whip right that's what he said sometimes you've got to Plat your whip and tell the devil one of us is getting out of here and it's not going to be me I'm G to hold the head let's stand musicians are coming not nearly done but I'm worn out totally exhausted we are in a critical moment critical moment we're on the precipice you can expect that the enemy is going to throw every distraction possible your way it's going to be up to you instead of letting life consume you if we lay our head on his chest until we can hear the heartbeat of the Lord worship is not just about singing it's not just about raising our hands worship is sometimes about listening to his heartbeat the bride wants to know what causes the Lord's heartbeat to LEAP to speed up because that's what we want to do we want to please him we want to Plat a whip and drive out everything of our life that is not him I give you a little permission to be a little selfish in a moment like this it can be very distracting trying to help others it is what we are called to do as a body but there are times that we have nothing to give Nancy would because of the way she was trained she was taught to lean into the Lord and she could give anybody a word and most of the time it would be very helpful and very accurate and and and amazing but we trained her a little differently because there comes a time that you're not always going to get a word I know we have some groupies here who are sort of positioning themselves always to hear a word it's kind of a dangerous thing if we're not completely Sanctified including our imagination because this little bride cannot afford to get our marching orders from any other Paradigm it's got to be the heartbeat of the Lord and listen what makes this heartbeat in my life might be different what I'm required to do may be different than what you're required to do so you can't watch me and only emulate what I do I can't just watch you and emulate what you do but we've got to find a way to shut out the rest your answers are not on YouTube your answers are in your prayer closet your answers are in prayer in the word yes that's where your answer is going to come always God will use this body to encourage each other and God will use us to give words of inspiration at times and we're thankful for the giftings of the body but there is a time when we just simply need to plug into him there is a meat that we need to partake of yes we can't eat the meat of obedience until we have an ear to hear his instruction are you with me yes are we going to make it are you kidding we made it that's right we made it somebody say what do you we made it it the Overcomer garment is already secured and laid aside for you sure you're going to make it but not by leaning on your own understanding hello only by holding on to his head marriage doesn't fix every problem before you drag somebody else into your problem seek God now find Deliverance now get help now let him set you free now come on folks the spirit of lust will destroy lives it'll destroy relationships betrayal is hard to deal with in marriage but we're living in a in an hour now where the Betrayal is not always blond-headed and long-legged sometimes it's just a pocket device I was talking with someone not too long ago and I said when I was a teenager pornography wasn't easily accessible you had to risk everything I sort of wished it was that way again you had to risk everything brother you had to go to magic Market or whatever they had and you had to be willing to ask somebody to get it from behind the stand or you had to find one of those smudy places or you could just walk in and buy it but you had you know kind of duck and dart and not so anymore it's Wi-Fi right into your home both men and women can struggle it sets you up for an impossible situation you need to Plat a whip you need to make up your mind I told someone recently I'm not going to counsel any more couples for marriage of a certain age without really talking about the nitty-gritties somebody just simply has to there is an epidemic of this lustful pornography spirit in our world today in our church World it stinks it's filthy I can sense it sometime and nearly nearly smell it sometime it's vile you do not have to be bound you don't have to eat the whole cake you don't deserve the whole cake it's the same kind of addiction the enemy will tell you you've worked hard you deserve a glance you deserve something it's a lie from hell right I know it's quiet we've got to be consumed with something more than the SMUD of this world that's right it's the Zeal of building God a house we don't want to we don't want to you know heal the sick and raise the dead just so we can say we've done it we want to do it because it's the heart of God he's still a Healer he's still a deliverer he wants to help us he wants signs and wonders to follow the Holy Ghost fill bride of Jesus Christ he wants of people that prove him to be Hebrews 13 and8 on a regular basis in order to do that we're going to have to be consumed we're going to have to be eaten up by the Zeal not of the physical House of our own building driven with a passion oh God I don't want anything to to arrest [Music] me other than you I don't want food to control my life I don't want lust to control my life jealousy to oh God I want to be wrapped up tied up tangled up with a passion to build up a house that you can come and take full occupancy full manifestation of the word full creative spoken word Authority come on we are not waiting on brother brandom to come in a airplane and a tent to bring it to us he's done all that he can do to help us it's just you and Jesus now the word has made him real to us again you need to go in with him right few weeks ago in a Saturday when that awful phone call came I was putting the final touches on a message that I was going to preach that night was going to carry the theme forward to his company threes a crowd and finish with the image of the Prophet we cannot let Daniel have the preeminence he was just a servant and even if the king listen listen we're we're here we're in that Kingdom because we've got a president elect who's far from righteous and he's not our answer thank God thank God for helping us but he's not the answer that Daniel wasn't the answer it was the god of Daniel brother brandham said the king made an image not of himself but of Daniel and commanded the people to Bow Down and Worship the image of Daniel the Prophet but there were three little boys young men who said oh Daniel has been our brother we love him like no other there's not but one Daniel we like to eat with him we like to joke with him we like to we like to Camp with him we we just want to spend as much time with him as possible but we know that he just has feet of Flesh and he's just a sinner that's saved by grace and we can't let him have preeminence in our life so I'm sorry but we won't be able to bow to the image we love him too much there's going to be a bride who sees the decreasing of John the Baptist and the increasing of the Messiah who says we love a we love the prophet that God has sent too much to make him as they say more than a man it's got to be Jesus it's got to be him father I see that you are drawing a Line in the Sand and I want to be standing on
