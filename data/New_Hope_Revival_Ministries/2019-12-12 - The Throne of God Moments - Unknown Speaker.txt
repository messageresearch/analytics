Description:
The reality of the throne of God is right here in the believer in the last day. 

We’re seeking the reality of who He is and that He would come in such power and in such fullness that He reigns, completely, totally reigns over every aspect of our lives, including our time.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the reality of the throne of God is right here in the believer in the last stage because we understand by the revelation of the New Testament that the Ark of the Covenant is no longer a box hidden somewhere in a cave in Jerusalem but the Ark of the Covenant is once again the throne of God and the throne of God is only in simple form in another dimension the reality of the throne of God is not somewhere else the reality of the throne of God is right here in the believer in the last day this is his throne in this hour one day he will gather us all back into his throne in another dimension but in this hour his throne is the Ark of the Covenant and the Ark of the Covenant is the as the inside of the inside of the believer so here he is and so if he is there then our shoud should not appraise our response should not be based on feeling at all it should be based on reality and he's on through it's not based on on what we see God doing because the bride is not seeking his hand she has his hand he gave us his hand it's part of the mat rollin he gave us his hand we're not seeking his hand we're seeking him we're seeking the reality of who he is and that he would come in such power and in such fullness that he reigns completely totally reigns over every aspect of our lives including our time everything is mirrored he's lord over every part of who we are does anybody believe that's the reality of the word [Music]
