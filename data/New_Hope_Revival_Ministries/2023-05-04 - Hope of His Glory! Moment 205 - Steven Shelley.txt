TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign I recognize that on occasion our Eternal uh part that part that is not of this world that eternal life that you and I carry by the new birth it squeezes out through the cracks sometimes and people begin to see that there is something that is not religion there is something that is reality how many of you want to be so filled with eternity that everywhere you go eternity just oozes out of the pores of your skin and somebody says I want what you've got we live this life as an offering unto God who has been so good to us I'm telling you the goodness of God keeps chasing you and I down can anybody say Amen he's after you he wants to bless you he wants to fill you with who he is he wants to so fill you that those around you in line at the restaurant if you're brave enough to go to Walmart wherever you go God wants to let that light shine out of you in such a way that's part of the glorification that that caps off our Redemption what we're talking about here is something higher than what you can accomplish out of your own ambition this is God filling you so full of who he is that you can hardly help yourself it just comes out of your mouth it comes out of your language your vocabulary is influenced by eternity and the way you live the way you the way you choose your to pay your bills the way you conduct your business testifies if there's a living God who lives inside of you being glorified as a fifth part of the plan five steps of redemption that doesn't mean going to heaven God's not talking to us in this scripture in Romans the Apostle Paul is not talking about going to heaven he's talking about something he wants to do for us now it's speaking about us receiving a revelation of his glory that works in US Christ in you what's the rest of that the hope of glory it's that portion of his glory it's the hope of his glory that's working on the inside of you and that's what we're after we're after Christ that we might win him we're not working this life for a for a mansion somewhere we're not working this life so that we can walk on golden streets and have a mansion and and see all the beauty all these things are beautiful to think about and Heaven is a lovely place but you know we're not working for heaven we're doing what we do and living what we live because we want to be a light and we want to be a testimony of the hope of Christ that lies within us the glory is working in US internally to position us to a place where we can fully step into everything written about us in the books you got to have it all there's a part of you that cannot surrender to God's full plan that he has written about you in the books of Heaven until that Glory starts shining in you and on you and through you and you start experiencing a true change one that is not about getting a good blessing in church one that is about going outside of the Four Walls of this church and living a new life we can call this stage of redemption this glorification stage we can call it a point of convergence because everything that God was doing for us up to this point it starts weaving together in a place of convergence to propel us how many of you know that means to push us forward into completing his Destiny plan for our life
