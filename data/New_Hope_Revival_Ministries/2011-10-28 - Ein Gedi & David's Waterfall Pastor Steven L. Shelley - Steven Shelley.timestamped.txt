[1:03] Heat. Heat.
[1:30] Hello everybody. We've just had a
[1:32] wonderful hike up in the springs of
[1:35] Angeti and we have made it all the way
[1:37] up to David's waterfall and uh it's so
[1:40] cool and so refreshing after having such
[1:42] a hot uh hike up in the hills. The kids
[1:45] are having a good time in the pools and
[1:48] we are remembering some of the exciting
[1:50] biblical things that took place in this
[1:52] area. We know for sure that David was
[1:54] hiding in one of the caves of Engeti
[1:57] when Saul was pursuing him. And uh I
[2:00] think the scripture records that he sent
[2:02] 3,000 men into these hills to find
[2:06] David, to confiscate David. Of course,
[2:08] we know how the story ended in the
[2:10] Bible, but David was God's man for the
[2:12] hour, but we just want to say hello to
[2:14] you and send you lots of love and
[2:16] greetings from Angetti, Israel. And uh
[2:18] thank you for helping us to get here.
[2:21] And uh we just are having a wonderful
[2:23] time. We're sensing the presence of the
[2:25] Lord wherever we go. and we don't even
[2:26] know all that God is doing in us. Um,
[2:30] but we just pray that as the coolness of
[2:32] the water refreshes us physically, that
[2:35] the cool water of life that flows from
[2:37] Yeshua will refresh us while we're here.
[2:40] And we're sending some of that
[2:41] refreshing toward you right now in the
[2:43] name of Yeshua, the Messiah, be
[2:45] refreshed from the springs of living
[2:47] water that literally flow here in the
[2:50] deserts of Israel. God bless
[2:53] you. Heat. Heat.
