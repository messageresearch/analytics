[0:02] [Music]
[0:09] will you live the Jesus life the
[0:12] Ascended life the supernatural life from
[0:15] the realm of the Spirit
[0:24] but I've got good news for you and that
[0:27] is God by nature is a redeemer
[0:30] [Music]
[0:36] is surrendering our mind to the word
[0:39] that's what makes the big difference
[0:41] that's the great mystery right Christ in
[0:43] you the hope award
[0:59] hello there I'm Pastor Steven Shelley of
[1:03] New Hope revival ministries in Smith
[1:06] Station Alabama and I'm coming to you
[1:08] today on behalf of the gospel channel
[1:10] brother Eric Erickson and all of the
[1:13] fine staff that worked tirelessly to
[1:16] make sure that the gospel channel
[1:19] continues to bring you good spiritual
[1:23] programming programming that will teach
[1:26] you the Word of God and strengthen you
[1:29] in your spirit man and encourage you to
[1:33] keep pressing toward the wonderful
[1:36] wonderful Savior our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:39] there's a whole lot that goes on to
[1:42] bringing this good gospel programming
[1:44] into your home and I hope that you will
[1:47] pray for the gospel channel and that you
[1:51] will believe God with us for all the
[1:54] provision that is necessary it's not
[1:57] cheap to buy time on the satellite and
[2:02] to get this Network into your home it's
[2:05] very expensive and we want to thank
[2:08] every one of the partners of the gospel
[2:11] channel for what you've done maybe
[2:13] you've never given and God would lay it
[2:16] on your heart and you would step up to
[2:18] the plate and you would sow into the
[2:21] work of the Lord I know this I believe
[2:24] that it's fertile ground and I believe
[2:27] that the vision that God has given
[2:29] brother Erickson is a real vision from
[2:33] God I believe that the gospel Channel is
[2:36] going to be raised up by the Lord to
[2:39] even accomplish much more than what it's
[2:43] accomplishing right now so what we can
[2:46] do is partner with them in prayer and
[2:49] with our giving and send them a note of
[2:52] encouragement when you can let them know
[2:55] that what they do is blessing your life
[2:59] and encouraging you to keep moving
[3:02] toward the Lord I know that it will be
[3:04] an encouragement to them I know how
[3:07] exciting it is when we hear from you
[3:09] when you
[3:10] call or email with your prayer requests
[3:13] we know there's someone on the other end
[3:15] of this camera it's encouraging to know
[3:19] to have a name to have a location and we
[3:23] take those prayer requests to the Lord
[3:25] and we mention them in our local
[3:26] services and we believe that God
[3:30] certainly answers prayer we have been
[3:34] studying together in our last few
[3:36] sessions schemes and devices and we use
[3:41] as a theme for this study 2nd
[3:44] Corinthians chapter 2 verse 11 where it
[3:47] reads lest Satan should get an advantage
[3:50] of us for we are not ignorant of his
[3:53] devices I truly believe that as you
[3:57] watch these programs you're going to
[4:01] learn not to be ignorant of the devil's
[4:03] devices and I believe this is number 4
[4:07] in the series and I don't know if you
[4:10] know this or not but you can go on
[4:12] YouTube and search for new hope revival
[4:17] ministries and you will be able to watch
[4:20] in in rerun you might say all of the
[4:24] programs that we do for the gospel
[4:27] channel so if today is your first day
[4:30] joining us in this series you can go to
[4:33] youtube and you can find parts one
[4:36] through three and watch them because I
[4:40] believe that the Lord is revealing some
[4:44] of the ways the schemes the devices the
[4:48] cycles that the enemy is using to hold
[4:51] God's people back I have good news for
[4:54] you again today and that is Jesus is the
[4:57] victor no matter what the enemy does no
[5:01] matter how he comes against you if you
[5:03] are washed in the blood of the Lamb if
[5:07] you are surrendering your life in
[5:10] obedience to the Word of God you have
[5:13] every right to pick up every weapon in
[5:16] the arsenal of the Spirit and use it to
[5:20] defeat the enemy to break down in
[5:24] a stronghold or any death structure that
[5:29] the enemy has raised up in your life we
[5:32] talked about strongholds recently and
[5:35] that is from the scripture that talks
[5:39] about casting down pulling down every
[5:44] stronghold the enemy what a stronghold
[5:47] is is in in the original that word means
[5:52] a castle or a fortress or a fortified
[5:55] place but if if there is a stronghold it
[6:00] also means to have possession of the
[6:03] mind and the emotions the enemy doesn't
[6:07] just want to pass by and leave a thought
[6:09] or two negative on your life he wants to
[6:14] build a platform he'd like to build a
[6:16] throne he'd like to just come and sit
[6:19] down in your life and continue to hold
[6:22] you back from the promises of God we
[6:26] talked about the last time we were
[6:28] together that the enemy one of the
[6:31] strongholds that the enemy often uses is
[6:33] Hope deferred that is hope that the
[6:37] enemy has violently seized hold of in
[6:40] your life dreams and visions passions
[6:45] things that God has stirred up in you
[6:48] purposes and why's that the Lord has
[6:51] revealed to be a part of your life and
[6:54] yet that old thief desires to come and
[6:58] steal them from us we're just thankful
[7:01] that we know greater is He that is in us
[7:04] than he that is in the world when we
[7:07] finished our study last time we were
[7:10] together we were talking about death
[7:13] structures and I'd like to give you just
[7:17] a little definition here about a death
[7:20] structure these structures are not only
[7:23] built over individual lives but also
[7:25] over whole congregations and ministries
[7:29] the enemy's ultimate desire is to cause
[7:32] death to visions to ruin lives and
[7:37] death structures are basically this
[7:40] whatever is not releasing life in you
[7:45] must be recognized as something that is
[7:49] releasing death Webster's dictionary
[7:52] defines the word structure as the manner
[7:56] of which something is constructed as a
[8:00] building or a bridge it implies how
[8:03] something is built a structure is
[8:08] similar to a framework by definition
[8:11] when we consider our bodies we often
[8:15] refer to our frame which is our skeletal
[8:18] system it involves the body structures
[8:22] and the bone structures let me read a
[8:25] portion of scripture to you to see if we
[8:27] can help help you see the difference
[8:29] between a death structure and that which
[8:32] releases life in you let's look at 2nd
[8:36] Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 6 in the
[8:39] amplified it is he who has qualified us
[8:44] praise God
[8:46] making us to be fit and worthy and
[8:51] sufficient I want you to know that your
[8:55] worthiness is not based on your
[8:57] performance your worthiness is based on
[9:02] what Jesus Christ has accomplished on
[9:05] your behalf your worthiness your fitness
[9:10] your qualification it's not your talent
[9:13] and your skill it's based on your
[9:16] yielded nough stew who has already
[9:19] finished the work of salvation and made
[9:23] it gloriously available to you and I as
[9:26] individuals it is he who has qualified
[9:30] us making us to be fit and worthy and
[9:35] sufficient as ministers and as
[9:38] dispensers of a new covenant of
[9:42] salvation through Christ the Anointed
[9:46] One not menís
[9:49] of the letter of legally written code
[9:53] but of the spirit for the code of the
[9:57] law kills the King James says the letter
[10:01] of the law kills but the amplified says
[10:05] the code of the law kills but the holy
[10:09] spirit makes alive I want you to know
[10:14] that the enemy can sometimes build a
[10:18] death structure over your life of
[10:20] religion he can make you so religious
[10:26] that you miss the joy of having an
[10:30] intimate personal relationship with
[10:34] Jesus Christ what happens is you become
[10:38] like the Pharisees that Jesus rebuked
[10:42] they were straining at a little gnat a
[10:47] tiny little insect while they were
[10:50] swallowing a camel the enemy likes for
[10:54] you and I to focus on the code of the
[10:57] law the letter of the law and that in
[11:01] itself though a gift from God and it has
[11:06] a divine purpose there's no doubt about
[11:09] it
[11:09] but if we don't approach it from from
[11:13] the place of being qualified by Jesus
[11:16] Christ being saved sanctified and made
[11:20] worthy through Jesus Christ we will get
[11:23] caught up in in the ritual of the law
[11:27] and in the routine and tradition of
[11:30] religion and we will miss the joy that
[11:34] comes from having a personal intimate
[11:40] daily relationship with Jesus Christ you
[11:44] can keep all the commandments and not
[11:47] have relationship I truly believe that
[11:52] God doesn't change his mind about his
[11:54] word I truly believe that the
[11:58] instructions that God has given us
[12:01] and his word are very very important but
[12:03] the enemy will take something as
[12:05] beautiful as the instruction of God and
[12:09] use it in your life as a framework to
[12:13] release death over you and death over
[12:16] your family we've got to be very careful
[12:18] because we want to have the life that
[12:22] the Holy Spirit brings from the word
[12:24] it's clear that if we are led by the law
[12:28] by doctrines of men by religious systems
[12:31] or traditions that make the Word of God
[12:34] none effective we're going to experience
[12:37] death rather than life let me explain to
[12:42] you that I don't believe all traditions
[12:44] are of the devil
[12:45] I don't believe that all traditions are
[12:47] just mere religious ritual I believe
[12:50] there are traditions that are rich that
[12:53] are powerful that have prophetic
[12:56] significance in our life but I'm talking
[12:59] about rituals that we can hold on to
[13:02] that render the Word of God non
[13:05] effective in our life that condemned us
[13:09] and cause us to judge and condemn others
[13:13] you know I believe in something that we
[13:15] sometimes refer to as convictions Holy
[13:18] Spirit convictions I believe there are
[13:21] things in your life that the Spirit of
[13:23] God will put his finger on and and point
[13:28] out to you with understanding that you
[13:31] should refrain from those things and
[13:34] they may not be necessarily things that
[13:37] are completely totally outlined in the
[13:40] scripture but the Spirit of God quickens
[13:43] it to you and says I want you to stay
[13:45] away from that I want you to refrain
[13:48] from those things I want you to know I
[13:50] appreciate the Holy Spirit of God
[13:53] leading me in my life
[13:55] I appreciate God putting that little
[13:58] prick on my conscience I appreciate God
[14:02] you know creating for me some boundaries
[14:06] I like to say spiritual boundaries that
[14:10] are created for me
[14:13] God knows me better than I know myself
[14:16] and he knows there may be certain areas
[14:20] where I need tighter boundaries than
[14:24] someone else what I have to be careful
[14:27] is to do is to follow those convictions
[14:30] to to stand in the boundaries and the
[14:34] parameters of what the Spirit of God
[14:36] deals with me about for myself and as
[14:41] the priest of my home I must also
[14:45] believe God to protect my family and as
[14:49] a pastor a shepherd of a local
[14:51] congregation I believe God uses those
[14:54] convictions to help guide us as a family
[14:58] as of as a people as a congregation but
[15:02] what we must be careful not to do is to
[15:05] judge and condemn others based on our
[15:08] convictions the Word of God is the same
[15:12] for all of us the truths of God's Word
[15:17] they're not optional they are unto us
[15:21] they are given to us but I do believe
[15:24] there are areas of conviction sometimes
[15:28] people will will erroneously call them
[15:31] tradition when when they're not
[15:34] necessarily tradition but but areas
[15:38] where the Spirit of God has spoken to to
[15:42] someone who has waited in prayer I would
[15:45] not have you to participate in the
[15:47] things of the world and this thing in
[15:49] particular we need conviction we need to
[15:53] to seek the Lord and ask for his
[15:56] leadership too to steer us away from
[16:00] things that might cause us to stumble
[16:02] but we don't want to add so much of a
[16:06] burden to people with our own conviction
[16:10] not not the word the word is not a
[16:12] burden the Bible said His commandments
[16:15] are not Grievous to me and they're not
[16:18] Grievous to me but sometimes we can take
[16:21] these little areas of personal
[16:23] leadership and conviction and we can try
[16:26] to weigh
[16:27] damn that brings death instead of life
[16:32] and so be careful how you lump
[16:35] everything into the same category if we
[16:38] as individuals are corporately in our
[16:41] churches build our faith on either of
[16:43] these foundations the traditions of men
[16:46] the doctrines of men religious systems
[16:49] and orders if we build our faith on
[16:52] either of these foundations rather than
[16:55] on the pure truth of God's Word as
[16:57] revealed by the Holy Spirit
[17:00] we'll be caught up in structures that
[17:04] tend that promote death instead of life
[17:08] it's going to be imperative that we who
[17:12] are a part of the limnic bride of Jesus
[17:14] Christ and I believe there are members
[17:17] of that remnant bride that that are
[17:20] connected to us through the gospel
[17:22] channel I believe that we must seek to
[17:25] overthrow to pull down every structure
[17:30] of death that the enemy would raise up
[17:33] in our life every framework of thought
[17:37] patterns and you know traditions we
[17:43] spoke about religious ritual that we
[17:47] have added to the Word of God and it
[17:50] promotes death and it leads to Hope
[17:53] deferred I believe we've got to be
[17:56] faithful to ask the Lord Lord revealed
[17:58] to me any area in my life where I've got
[18:01] off where I've stepped off the word
[18:04] where I've got a little bit off track
[18:05] and I'm bringing death to my family
[18:08] instead of life I hope I'm not confusing
[18:10] you I just want to expose any way that
[18:14] the Lord brings to my heart that the
[18:17] enemy is using to to build these
[18:21] strongholds in people's lives I want to
[18:24] expose every scheme I wish the Lord
[18:27] would show me every way that the enemy
[18:30] is working against people today every
[18:32] device that the devil is using because
[18:35] I'd like to sound the alarm
[18:37] I'd like to uncover the enemy
[18:40] I'd like to expose him for who he really
[18:43] is because I know that we have Authority
[18:46] and power through Jesus Christ
[18:48] against our enemy let's look at
[18:51] Ephesians chapter 2 verses 21 and 22 and
[18:55] we can do that also in the amplified
[18:58] Ephesians 2 21 and 22 in him the whole
[19:04] structure the body is joined bound
[19:10] welded together harmoniously and it
[19:15] continues to rise to grow to increase
[19:18] into a holy temple in the Lord a
[19:23] sanctuary dedicated and consecrated and
[19:27] sacred to the presence of the Lord how
[19:31] many of you want your body to be
[19:33] sanctified consecrated dedicated to the
[19:38] presence of the Lord and how many of you
[19:41] want to know that you're attached to the
[19:43] body of Christ who is also desiring to
[19:47] be sanctified consecrated dedicated to
[19:52] providing a place for the presence of
[19:55] the Lord to land to show up in your life
[19:59] experience in him and in fellowship with
[20:04] one another you yourselves are also
[20:08] being built up this is the kind of
[20:10] structure that we need a structure that
[20:14] connects us to him and to one another
[20:19] not a structure that connects us to our
[20:22] enemy and the Spirit of death you see
[20:26] the difference I believe this scripture
[20:29] is giving us a plan for a structure in
[20:32] the body of Christ that leads to life
[20:35] and to hope let me read verse 22 again
[20:38] all the way through in him and in
[20:42] fellowship with one another you
[20:45] yourselves also are being built up into
[20:48] this structure with the rest
[20:52] to form a fixed abode a dwelling place
[20:56] of God in by through the spirit I want
[21:03] to be an individual temple unto the Lord
[21:07] I want him to be able to come and occupy
[21:11] my life as his body my temple my body as
[21:17] his temple no you not that your body is
[21:20] the temple of the Holy Spirit and this
[21:23] is the kind of life that we want to be
[21:26] ministering in and we want to be moving
[21:29] in not death I want to release life
[21:32] wherever I go hope in Jesus Christ
[21:37] a death structure is created when the
[21:41] devil builds on the foundation of past
[21:44] hurts and pains and failures and
[21:49] disappointments and the weaknesses of
[21:52] yesterday can I read it again a death
[21:55] structure is created when the devil
[21:58] builds upon the foundation of past of
[22:01] the past the pains the failures the
[22:06] disappointments and the weaknesses of
[22:08] yesterday and the devil seeks to
[22:11] convince you and I we can never break
[22:13] free from our past we can never break
[22:17] free and you know he anoints people in
[22:19] our lives to constantly remind us of
[22:22] where we were what we used to be who we
[22:25] used to be I want you to know if any man
[22:28] be in Christ he is a new creature he is
[22:33] a new creation old things old life old
[22:39] sins
[22:40] old habits have passed away and behold
[22:44] all things Oh a ll all things have
[22:52] become new Satan desires to lock you in
[22:57] a death structure of your past if he can
[23:01] keep you moping in the
[23:04] asked wallowing in the disappointment
[23:07] hurts pains failures of the past he just
[23:10] builds a structure of death all over
[23:13] your life and holds you as his prisoner
[23:17] but I'm telling you there's Liberty for
[23:19] you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[23:22] through repentance by accepting what the
[23:27] Lord has done for you how he has
[23:29] qualified you how he has made you worthy
[23:33] with his own blood
[23:35] start fellowshipping the truth start
[23:38] choosing to move past your past and into
[23:43] your present
[23:45] somebody said didn't you mean to say
[23:47] into your future
[23:48] you can't move into the future until you
[23:52] are willing to embrace the present
[23:54] you've got to begin to recognize that
[23:57] God is moving today he is an on-time God
[24:02] yes he is he never misses an appointment
[24:06] he never shows up ten minutes too late
[24:10] he's an on-time God he is a now God and
[24:15] he has a now word for you in your life
[24:19] he is not just the God of history but
[24:23] the scripture says that he is a present
[24:25] help in the time of need do you
[24:29] presently need the Lord's help then step
[24:33] past your past make up your mind I'm
[24:36] going to meet Jesus Christ who is the
[24:40] same yesterday and today and forever I'm
[24:45] going to believe that he has come to
[24:48] deliver me from my past failure from my
[24:52] past hurts and wounds you know folks I
[24:54] know there are some of you watching this
[24:56] program today you've been so wounded so
[25:00] hurt so disappointed so let down so
[25:03] betrayed your life you have known great
[25:08] pain and great sorrow and I I'd like to
[25:12] say how sorry I am
[25:14] I mean that from the bottom of my heart
[25:16] I'm sorry for your pain
[25:19] I really feel compassion toward you in
[25:25] your pain and in your wounds and the
[25:29] hurts of your past I know there have
[25:32] been people who have let you down
[25:34] I myself have let people down not always
[25:38] being able to be what they needed me to
[25:41] be at that moment I know what it feels
[25:44] like also to be let down and I am I'm so
[25:47] sorry that you had to feel that and walk
[25:51] through that and experienced that but
[25:54] I'm even more sorry than it has
[25:56] paralyzed you I'm even more sorry that
[26:00] the enemy has used all of that stuff to
[26:03] keep you locked in a death structure and
[26:06] I've come today to tell you you don't
[26:10] have to live under a structure of death
[26:12] you don't have to be locked in a prison
[26:15] in a stronghold of Satan Jesus Christ
[26:20] has come that you might have live let's
[26:23] quote the whole thing the thief that's
[26:26] who we're talking about he cometh not
[26:28] but for to steal to kill and us to
[26:30] destroy but Jesus said I am come that
[26:35] you might have life say that with me
[26:38] life life it's no life when you're
[26:43] locked in your past it's no real life
[26:46] when you're when you're living as a
[26:49] prisoner to a structure of death all
[26:51] around you you can't break free jesus
[26:54] said I am come that you might have life
[26:56] and that you might have it more
[26:59] abundantly
[27:00] I want to declare to you today in the
[27:04] most holy name of our Lord and Savior
[27:07] Jesus Christ that he has made a way for
[27:11] you and I to have not only life but
[27:15] abundant life more abundance in our life
[27:19] God has made that available
[27:22] if you can recognize how the enemy has
[27:26] built this structure scaffolding around
[27:28] your life that only leads to death and
[27:31] that he has built that scaffolding that
[27:34] structure on the foundation of the past
[27:37] what a scam what a scam artist the devil
[27:42] is to build this structure of death or
[27:46] smack-dab in the middle of your past
[27:49] knowing that you have not been able to
[27:52] get through your past to live in the
[27:55] present and to reach for the future he
[27:57] then attempts to take that and establish
[28:00] a strategy that becomes a structure
[28:04] resulting in abandonment or death of
[28:07] vision an abortion of Destiny Hope
[28:10] deferred let me read it again he then
[28:13] attempts to establish a strategy that
[28:16] becomes a structure resulting in
[28:20] abandonment or death a vision you know
[28:23] some of you God has given you hope for
[28:25] your future God's given you vision for
[28:28] ministry how you might help others how
[28:32] you might serve others well the devil
[28:34] doesn't want you moving ahead to obey
[28:36] God because he knows that if you begin
[28:38] to move in obedience to the call and the
[28:41] plan of God in your life it's going to
[28:43] release the abundance it's going to
[28:47] release the blessing and the devil
[28:49] doesn't want you to be blessed of God he
[28:51] doesn't want you operating in the
[28:53] abundant life he wants to shrink you he
[28:57] wants to pull you back and pull you down
[29:00] but Jesus wants to increase you he wants
[29:04] to expand you into his vision for your
[29:08] life you know it's true sometimes we get
[29:11] the wrong vision for our future
[29:13] sometimes in our human effort we come up
[29:16] with the wrong plan but I'm willing I
[29:19] pray you'll be also willing to trade in
[29:22] my vision for my life for his vision for
[29:25] my life I know I have ambitions plans
[29:28] things I'd like to do things I would
[29:32] like to see half
[29:33] but I'm willing to submit that to the
[29:37] one who has given me life Who am I to
[29:40] tell him how my life is to be he has
[29:44] already great plans for my life I've
[29:49] just got to be willing sometime to
[29:52] submit my life plan my life strategy for
[29:56] what he has planned for my life the
[29:59] enemy wants you to give up on all vision
[30:02] all plans he wants you to give up on
[30:06] even living out your destiny once a
[30:10] death structure is in place over us
[30:13] around us the enemy seeks to gain
[30:17] illegitimate Authority control over a
[30:21] life I want you to know if the enemy
[30:23] can't move you from the inside if he
[30:26] can't possess you from the inside he
[30:30] will control you from the outside that's
[30:33] his desire is to control you he is a an
[30:37] awful taskmaster he's a terrible slave
[30:41] driver he wants to crack his whip
[30:44] against your shoulder and cause you to
[30:47] serve Him even while you're a member of
[30:51] the local church I tell you that's wrong
[30:54] it's just wrong
[30:56] to allow the enemy to control our lives
[30:59] when we call ourselves Christians
[31:03] members of the body of Christ but if we
[31:06] don't know any better if we're ignorant
[31:08] of the devil schemes and devices and
[31:11] strategies then you know we're almost
[31:14] non responsible for what's going on but
[31:19] there must be an answer there must be a
[31:22] solution because ignorance is not the
[31:25] answer
[31:26] truth is what makes us free and so I
[31:28] believe God is raised up avenues he has
[31:32] raised up tools like Christian
[31:36] television like the ability to stream
[31:39] and to broadcast even over the Internet
[31:42] I believe God has raised up some of
[31:45] these
[31:46] purposes some of these technologies we
[31:48] should say and and means so that we can
[31:52] get the truth that we need to expose the
[31:56] enemy
[31:57] I mean yank the cover off of him really
[32:03] show him that we know he's just a bluff
[32:06] he's a tool in the hand of God to bring
[32:10] the Saints of God to perfection he only
[32:13] has the power and control over our lives
[32:17] that we forfeit that we allow him to
[32:21] have and this is how he operates he uses
[32:25] all of these death structures this
[32:28] living in the past causing us to turn
[32:33] loose of our vision and our hope for the
[32:35] future and builds that that you know
[32:39] structure all around us to kind of lock
[32:41] us in to keep help from coming to us and
[32:43] to keep us from reaching out for help
[32:46] because he wants to gain that
[32:48] illegitimate authority that illegitimate
[32:50] control over our life you know I heard
[32:54] once someone said if you ask the devil
[32:56] to dinner he'll bring his suitcase he
[32:59] won't just come to eat dinner with you
[33:01] he'll come to move in in other words if
[33:03] you open any door to the enemy in this
[33:07] hour he will move in he will absolutely
[33:11] move in the old timers used to say if
[33:15] you give the devil an inch he'll take a
[33:17] mile I want you to know he'll do more
[33:19] than that he'll continue to take and
[33:22] take and take and take as long as you
[33:24] just forfeit and surrender what's really
[33:28] yours don't you think it's about time to
[33:31] expose the enemy and for the body of
[33:33] Christ to rise up and take possession of
[33:36] the kingdom of God in the earth don't
[33:38] you really believe that there is hope
[33:40] for this world I do and it's only found
[33:44] in a true personal relationship with
[33:47] Jesus Christ the church is sick the body
[33:51] of Christ has fallen ill we have fallen
[33:54] prey it seems and have
[33:57] prisoners of war to the enemy and it's
[34:01] time that we wake up out of our slumber
[34:04] and we realize that we have taken from
[34:08] the enemy long enough we have the power
[34:11] to overcome and to defeat the enemy who
[34:16] comes to steal our hope and our vision
[34:19] and our purpose look at mark with me
[34:22] just a moment chapter 3 verse 27 and I'm
[34:26] going to read that also in the amplified
[34:29] it says but no one can go into a strong
[34:34] Mans house and ransack his household
[34:37] goods right and left and sees them as
[34:40] plunder unless he first binds the
[34:43] strongman then indeed he may thoroughly
[34:47] plunder his house in Luke chapter 11
[34:51] verse 21 and 22 Jesus spoke of the
[34:54] strongman who is prepared and armed to
[34:58] keep his home and to protect his
[35:01] possessions but warns of what can happen
[35:04] when a stronger than he comes upon him
[35:08] and here is here's that verse when a
[35:11] strong man armed keepeth his palace his
[35:13] goods are in peace but when a stronger
[35:16] than he shall come upon him and overcome
[35:18] him he taketh from him all his armor
[35:21] wherein he trusted and divideth his
[35:23] spoils the original strongman here is
[35:26] you to have possession over your own
[35:30] life over your own giftings over the
[35:34] things that God has invested in you
[35:37] you're the original strongman here
[35:40] you're the one who keeps the house it's
[35:42] your home and you're the keeper of that
[35:45] home but if one stronger than you are
[35:49] should come upon you then he will come
[35:52] in and take every weapon and steal all
[35:55] of your possession I want you to know
[35:57] there is no no power no principality no
[36:02] spiritual wickedness that's more
[36:04] powerful than a man
[36:06] a woman who has fully surrendered to the
[36:10] life of Jesus Christ I've got a stronger
[36:13] than them all living inside of me and
[36:17] you do too through the new birth if
[36:20] you've been born again by the spirit
[36:24] into the family of God that we can say
[36:27] as we often quote greater is he that is
[36:30] in you than he that is in the world the
[36:33] one who is with you helping you to
[36:36] protect to defend what has been given to
[36:40] you by grace if you'll keep him as Lord
[36:44] of your life it doesn't matter who the
[36:46] enemy uses and how he comes against you
[36:49] you will absolutely have the victory
[36:53] there is a term that's used in the New
[36:57] Testament called the seat of Satan and
[37:00] it was considered it's mentioned as
[37:05] being a part of the city of Pergamum at
[37:09] the end of the first century Pergamum
[37:12] was a thriving City so why does the
[37:15] Bible tell us in the book of Revelation
[37:18] that it was a dwelling place of Satan
[37:20] well the answer lies in the ruins of the
[37:24] city's temples on one side of this city
[37:27] of air a beautiful city there were many
[37:31] many beautiful buildings there but on
[37:34] the other side on the flip side the city
[37:37] of Pergamum was one of the darkest areas
[37:40] cities in the entire Roman Empire
[37:44] revelation 2 verse 13 says I know thy
[37:48] works and where thou dwellest even where
[37:51] Satan's seat is so Jesus speaking to the
[37:56] church in Pergamum telling them I know
[37:59] that Satan has a seat in your city he
[38:04] goes on and thou holdest fast my name
[38:07] and has not denied my faith even in
[38:10] those days wherein Antipas was my
[38:12] faithful martyr who was slain among you
[38:15] where Satan do
[38:18] here those terms where Satan's seat is
[38:21] where Satan dwelleth there were temples
[38:25] to false gods the people of Pergamum
[38:29] were known as the temple keepers of Asia
[38:31] the city had three large temples
[38:34] dedicated to the worship of the Roman
[38:37] Emperor another for the goddess Athena
[38:39] and the great altar of Zeus who was
[38:43] believed to be the king of the Greek
[38:45] gods many scholars believe this altar is
[38:49] what is being referred to as the throne
[38:52] of Satan mentioned in the book of
[38:54] Revelation the word throne in the Bible
[38:58] was used in a personal private residence
[39:02] it was a chair for the Lord of the house
[39:07] we might say the master of the house or
[39:10] in modern times we might say the man of
[39:14] the house the very fact that Jesus would
[39:17] use this terminology means that Satan
[39:22] felt at home in the city of Pergamum he
[39:27] sat on a throne there he built a place
[39:30] to dwell there in the hearts of men and
[39:33] women
[39:34] it was his territory Satan became the
[39:38] master of the house in the city of
[39:41] Pergamum it appears that false worship
[39:44] and pagan rituals that were going on in
[39:47] that city were evidently providing a
[39:50] home or a headquarters a comfortable
[39:54] place for evil to dwell there I want you
[39:58] to know this principle works today in a
[40:02] much more personal level there are lies
[40:05] that we agree with on a regular basis
[40:09] there are associations that we maintain
[40:13] there are roots of bitterness and
[40:16] jealousy and unforgiveness that we
[40:19] refuse to let go of there can even be
[40:23] objects in our home that we can possess
[40:28] that give the enemy permission to seat
[40:33] himself over our lives I want to read
[40:37] that again
[40:38] this principle works today in a much
[40:41] more personal level there are lies that
[40:44] we agree with associations that we
[40:47] maintain roots of bitterness jealousy
[40:49] unforgiveness that we hold on to and
[40:52] refuse to let go of and even objects
[40:55] that we possess that can give the enemy
[40:58] permission to seat himself over our
[41:02] lives god forbid
[41:05] how would you like to discover in this
[41:08] moment that you have kept a root of
[41:11] bitterness in your life so long that you
[41:14] are giving the enemy permission to sit
[41:18] down over your life to treat you as his
[41:21] throne even as he did in that in the
[41:25] churches of Asia Minor specifically the
[41:28] Church of Pergamum where it says Satan's
[41:31] seat was there was something about that
[41:34] temple in the city of Pergamum there was
[41:36] something about the rituals that went on
[41:39] in that awful place that that caused it
[41:43] to be considered the stronghold or the
[41:47] seat of the enemy but we're making this
[41:50] personal what if you found out that
[41:52] because you have refused to forgive a
[41:56] certain person you have actually been
[41:59] giving the enemy permission to keep
[42:02] harassing you in your life I tell you I
[42:05] believe it I truly believe that I think
[42:10] that it's even possible to travel abroad
[42:13] and to pick up little trinkets I know
[42:17] this will be too much for some people
[42:19] but I believe it's possible to pick up
[42:22] little trinkets and souvenirs from
[42:24] foreign countries that were that we're a
[42:26] little bit ignorant of of their culture
[42:30] and we don't know that sometimes these
[42:33] little may
[42:34] and little little figurines we call them
[42:38] are really images of false gods and
[42:44] representing parts of ancient culture
[42:48] that were against Christ that that were
[42:52] absolutely against truth and but by
[42:56] bringing those things into our home
[42:59] I've had God deal with me in my life and
[43:02] I've watched God deal with other people
[43:05] in their lives because when you when you
[43:08] when the enemy keeps coming in and
[43:10] coming in and coming in and and nothing
[43:12] you do seems to seal up your life and
[43:15] give you protection and victory against
[43:18] the enemy then you start examining even
[43:20] the smallest thing and I've had the Lord
[43:23] direct me at times letting me know there
[43:27] are there there's something attached to
[43:30] that item it represents something that
[43:33] you're not fully aware of and I've had
[43:35] the Lord and struck me get that out of
[43:38] your home and I have I've even burned
[43:41] items before because I didn't want them
[43:44] to fall into somebody else's hands you
[43:46] say wait a minute preacher now you're
[43:48] getting kind of fanatical well then I
[43:50] just encourage you to focus on on the
[43:53] issues that we mentioned bitterness and
[43:56] unforgiveness and but but what if all of
[43:58] that you've got victory over what if you
[44:01] truly can say I have no bitterness I
[44:04] I've forgiven everyone that I that's
[44:06] ever wrong to me but but still the enemy
[44:09] keeps getting permission it appears he
[44:12] has open access to my life to my family
[44:15] to our health to our finances well then
[44:18] you might consider some of the things
[44:21] that you've brought home some of the
[44:24] things that have been even given to you
[44:26] where where demons spirits like to use
[44:30] those items as permission to come in I'm
[44:36] not encouraging you to be a fanatic but
[44:38] I'm encouraging you to be a serious
[44:41] Christian a true serious child of God
[44:47] one who wants to walk in the fullness of
[44:50] abundance and blessing and truth and you
[44:53] are willing to submit everything every
[44:56] aspect of your life into the hands of
[44:59] the one who loved you so much so that he
[45:02] might put his finger on anything that
[45:06] would allow the enemy to keep harassing
[45:11] you and those you love I tell you you
[45:14] might pray about it you might ought to
[45:17] pray about it and consider these kinds
[45:19] of things because once we allow the
[45:22] enemy to have a seated position of false
[45:25] authority in our lives we have allowed
[45:27] him to be enthroned over us and he must
[45:31] be pulled down he'll never take himself
[45:36] off the throne over your life he will
[45:39] never surrender illegitimate authority
[45:42] that he is stolen from you automatically
[45:46] or just because he's tired of fooling
[45:48] with you and wants to go on and harass
[45:50] other people never once it's established
[45:53] the only way to break it is to tear it
[45:56] down in the authority of Jesus Christ
[45:59] and in order to do that you've got to be
[46:01] able to recognize it so how we would
[46:04] approach that is to just begin to pray
[46:06] lord it seems that the enemy has somehow
[46:11] been granted permission to just harass
[46:14] and torment my life and I'm asking you
[46:17] to turn the searchlight of your love
[46:20] onto my inner being and show me any root
[46:24] of unforgiveness any root of anger any
[46:27] root of jealousy or bitterness I'm
[46:30] asking you to search my home my
[46:32] treasures my possessions show me if any
[46:36] of my associations any of my memberships
[46:40] maybe I've joined something that's
[46:42] darker than what I realized when I was
[46:45] initiated in to a secret order or
[46:48] Society maybe through through
[46:52] relationships that are not of God we
[46:55] are not to be unequally yoked together
[46:57] with unbelievers
[46:58] sometimes even having business partners
[47:02] that are not born again of the Spirit of
[47:04] God a lot of these kinds of Association
[47:07] and you're just asking the Lord Lord
[47:09] show me put your finger look he's not
[47:13] going to come in and condemn you but he
[47:15] may gently guide you into that area show
[47:19] you specifically what what has given the
[47:22] enemy permission and what must you do
[47:24] you must then repent of participating
[47:28] hosting that thing in any way and cut
[47:31] off the access if it's an item then you
[47:35] just get rid of that thing as fast as
[47:37] you can if it's if it's a Association if
[47:41] it's unforgiveness then you have to
[47:44] start dealing with these things as God
[47:46] gives you strategy to do so as many as
[47:50] are led by the Spirit of God they are
[47:53] the sons of God and I'm telling you God
[47:56] wants to lead you by his Spirit if
[47:58] you'll open up your heart and let him to
[48:01] dethrone Satan from your life to rip him
[48:05] down from having any kind of seat or
[48:10] throne over your family your church your
[48:13] your own life isn't an individual you've
[48:16] got to go to the word you've got to use
[48:18] the Word of God and the scripture tells
[48:23] us just to simplify the strategy in the
[48:27] time that we have left in 2nd
[48:29] Corinthians 10 and 5 we are to cast down
[48:34] imaginations let me tell you something
[48:39] that is arguments and theories and
[48:46] reasonings every proud and lofty thing
[48:51] that sets itself up against the true
[48:54] knowledge of God and lead every thought
[48:57] and purpose away captive into the
[49:00] obedience of Christ
[49:02] the Messiah The Anointed One there is a
[49:05] way to deal
[49:08] with death structures with false
[49:11] paradigms and strongholds there's a way
[49:15] to deal with Satan if he has taken seat
[49:19] over your life because you have somehow
[49:22] granted him illegal access this is such
[49:27] a powerful portion of Scripture that I
[49:30] don't think we could do a lot of justice
[49:31] to it in the in the time that we have
[49:34] left but we might as well read it and
[49:36] start the process start the journey 2nd
[49:40] Corinthians 10 verse 3 through 6 in the
[49:45] King James it says for though we walk in
[49:48] the flesh we do not war after the flesh
[49:53] for the weapons of our warfare are not
[49:56] carnal but mighty through God to the
[49:59] pulling down of strongholds casting down
[50:05] imaginations and every high thing that
[50:10] exalteth itself against the knowledge of
[50:12] God and bringing into captivity every
[50:15] thought to the obedience of Christ and
[50:20] having in a readiness to revenge all
[50:24] disobedience when your obedience is
[50:28] fulfilled the next time we're together
[50:31] I'd like to break that down for you I'd
[50:34] like to look at it in the amplified and
[50:36] I'd like to see just what the Apostle
[50:40] was saying to us about how we deal with
[50:44] these accesses that have been granted to
[50:48] the enemy in our life one more time let
[50:52] me say this is not my favorite subject
[50:55] this is not something that I really
[50:58] enjoy digging into or teaching but I
[51:02] think it's vitally important in the hour
[51:05] that we're living in right now that we
[51:08] asked children of God this is a message
[51:11] to believers I'm really speaking to
[51:14] Christians who have followed through
[51:19] obedience the steps
[51:21] outlined in the scripture we have
[51:23] believed on the Lord Jesus Christ we
[51:26] have repented of our sin we have asked
[51:29] him to wash us in his righteous blood
[51:32] and set us free from the law of sin and
[51:35] death we have allowed his word to
[51:39] sanctify us to cleanse us to set us
[51:42] apart for the service of the Lord and
[51:45] then we have been filled with his life
[51:48] by the power of the Holy Spirit and yet
[51:52] in our Christian experience and in our
[51:54] Christian journey we have have really
[51:58] dealt with a lot of junk because of
[52:01] Satan because of the enemy and now we're
[52:04] learning some things we're we're having
[52:07] some things made clear to us that we can
[52:11] use to expose the enemy and to pull him
[52:15] down I tell you I don't want him to have
[52:17] any illegal Authority in my life I don't
[52:20] want him to have a place to sit in my
[52:22] life I want to make my life so filled
[52:26] with the truth and life of Jesus Christ
[52:28] that Satan has to keep his distance you
[52:33] know I believe it's possible I truly do
[52:36] I believe there's a victorious life
[52:39] available in Jesus Christ we're gonna
[52:41] face some stuff we're gonna still have
[52:43] battles we're gonna still deal with
[52:45] issues of sickness and and heartache and
[52:47] loss and grief life is filled with those
[52:50] kinds of things but I don't believe we
[52:52] have to just lay down and take whatever
[52:54] the enemy decides to throw on us I don't
[52:57] believe that Jesus has called us to
[53:01] serve Him and has forsaken us and left
[53:04] us to fall a victim and to become prey
[53:08] to our enemy
