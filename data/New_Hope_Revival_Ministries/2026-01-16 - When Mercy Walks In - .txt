Description:
Guilty. Not wrongfully charged—rightfully. Everything the accuser said was true. It could have been over right there. But the blood covered what you did, what you were doing, and what you haven't done yet. So when you stood in that courtroom with nothing to say for yourself, the door opened. Mercy walked in. And the accuser fell silent.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
when all hell had charged you &gt;&gt; AND HAD PLACED YOU AND I BOTH before the courtroom of the king &gt;&gt; rightfully so &gt;&gt; not wrongfully charged rightfully charged guilty of everything the devil said &gt;&gt; you did yeah I did you did yeah I did I did I did and I want you to know in that moment it could have been death &gt;&gt; in that moment it could have been destruction In that moment, it could have been uh leaving you as a pile of dust, but he rendered on your behalf a RIGHTEOUS JUDGMENT. HE COULD DO THAT BECAUSE you were covered by the blood &gt;&gt; of an innocent lamb. &gt;&gt; YOU WEREN'T JUST SAVED. DOES ANYBODY HEAR ME? &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; YOU WEREN'T JUST SAVED. &gt;&gt; You were redeemed. AND BECAUSE OF YOUR REDEMPTION, it covered what you had done &gt;&gt; IT COVERED WHAT YOU WERE DOING &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU GOT CALLED UP TO THE court &gt;&gt; and IT COVERED ANYTHING THAT YOU MIGHT EVER do &gt;&gt; as an infraction &gt;&gt; of his righteous instruction. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, REDEMPTION DOESN'T just cover us from the behind. IT COVERS US ALL AROUND. &gt;&gt; It's the present. It's the past. It's the future. &gt;&gt; God has a way of bringing us back TO HIS ORIGINAL THOUGHTS ABOUT US IN THE BEGINNING. HOW CAN HE DO IT? BECAUSE OF GRACE. BECAUSE OF THE BLOOD, &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS. HE SAID, "I WANT TO DRESS YOU &gt;&gt; in my righteousness &gt;&gt; because hell is marching hounds of hell and onslaught of darkness, &gt;&gt; WICKED. THAT'S IT. CONSTANTLY, constantly howling, constantly barking, constantly waring against the saints. 10 thousands of ten thousands of demon spirits lid, ripped off, loosed not on the institutional church, &gt;&gt; the bride &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THOSE SPIRITS ARE HONED in &gt;&gt; on you. &gt;&gt; They can't change who you are. They can't change your election. They can't change your prefix destiny. They But what they'll do is they will harass you &gt;&gt; until they cause you to let go of the very thing &gt;&gt; that gives you life. &gt;&gt; DON'T LET GO. &gt;&gt; DON'T LET GO. &gt;&gt; WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T LET GO. ABIDE in the vine. &gt;&gt; Don't let go of the vine. THE VINE IS THE LIFE SUPPORT. &gt;&gt; THE VINE IS THE LIFE SOURCE. DON'T LET GO OF THE VINE. NO MATTER WHAT THE ENEMY SAYS. YOU CAN GET MAD AT THE PREACHER, BUT DON'T GET MAD AT THE VINE. DON'T GET MAD AT JESUS. DON'T GET MAD AT THE WORD. &gt;&gt; That's life to us. That's all the enemy can do. He'll lie. He'll bring you to court. He'll make you think you're going to have to face it all on your own. &gt;&gt; You know, then you start thinking of the song. Then mercy walks in. &gt;&gt; Sure enough, &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE ACCUSER does stand in the courtroom. ACCUSING YOU AND AND OH, WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW? &gt;&gt; WHERE IS YOUR JESUS NOW? &gt;&gt; And you're this and you're that and you did and you did and you did that and you did the other and you said that and you said the other. AND THERE YOU STAND DEFENSELESS WITH NO ONE TO PLEAD YOUR CASE. AND THE door swings open &gt;&gt; AND MERCY WALKS IN &gt;&gt; AND PLEADS YOUR CASE AND THE ACCUSER IS SILENCED. &gt;&gt; He has nothing else to say.
