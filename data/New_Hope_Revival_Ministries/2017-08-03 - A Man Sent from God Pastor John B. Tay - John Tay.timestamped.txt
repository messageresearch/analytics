[0:02] Hello everybody. I'm Pastor Shelley
[0:04] again and I'm still here with my good
[0:07] friend for many years now since the
[0:10] early 90s, Pastor John B. Taye from
[0:14] Ghana, West Africa. I tell you, we have
[0:17] had some amazing times worshiping the
[0:20] Lord in his church. You've never lived
[0:22] until you've been to a church like that
[0:24] that is so founded, grounded on the word
[0:28] of God and so full of the Holy Ghost and
[0:31] fire. And I'm telling you, those people
[0:34] don't worship with their hands folded
[0:36] and their heads bowed. When they when
[0:38] it's time to worship God, they know how
[0:41] to worship him. And uh we could use a
[0:43] little of that in the United States and
[0:45] maybe wherever you're watching this
[0:46] little blog.
[0:51] Oh,
[0:54] [Applause]
[0:58] [Music]
[1:15] I could use a little of that fire, too.
[1:18] Well, it's in you. But I asked Pastor
[1:21] Tay to sit with me a little while longer
[1:23] because I wanted to mention two other
[1:25] things that he spoke to us about uh at
[1:28] our church on Sunday that I felt were
[1:30] very powerful. And uh we mentioned in
[1:33] the last blog that he was teaching us
[1:35] the importance of speaking and then
[1:38] expecting to see what we speak. So we
[1:42] should be very careful what we speak. um
[1:45] if we keep speaking about the darkness
[1:47] and keep speaking about the bad
[1:49] circumstances, they're going to hang
[1:51] around and they're only going to get
[1:52] worse. But if we will take the spirit of
[1:55] God and the word of God as our example
[1:58] when God saw the darkness and the chaos,
[2:01] he just spoke into it and uh he didn't
[2:04] speak about it. He spoke into it. Amen.
[2:06] And he said, "Let there be light and
[2:08] there was light." And then God saw the
[2:11] light and it was good. And so we enjoyed
[2:14] that uh little segment so much that I
[2:17] wanted you to share with us, Pastor Tay,
[2:20] uh what you spoke to us about Adam. You
[2:22] know, we we we're familiar with this uh
[2:25] scripture in the Bible, but you just
[2:28] brought it out in a in a very powerful
[2:31] way in Genesis where the animals were
[2:34] brought before Adam. And I'd like for
[2:37] you just to to share a little of that
[2:39] with us if you would. and just take the
[2:41] time you need.
[2:44] I'm grateful, Pastor Shelley, for
[2:45] another
[2:47] time. The Bible has the answer. Yes,
[2:51] sir.
[2:53] God created Mhm.
[2:57] And the Bible says, "And out of the
[3:00] ground the Lord God formed every beast
[3:04] of the field
[3:06] and every foul of the air and brought
[3:10] them unto Adam
[3:14] to
[3:16] see what he will call them.
[3:21] God created them.
[3:24] And he didn't give them
[3:26] names. So he wants Adam. Oh my. His
[3:32] son created in his
[3:35] image. That is his portion. Now this is
[3:40] going to show
[3:41] us that God has what he must do and what
[3:49] we his children must do. Mhm.
[3:54] For
[3:54] example,
[3:56] today if demon is troubling somebody and
[4:01] you stand there, oh God, come and cast
[4:04] out this devil out of this lady, God
[4:08] will not even hear you. Oh,
[4:11] because that is your job, right? There
[4:14] you go. He said you must do the casting
[4:19] of that demon. Hallelujah. Oh God, come
[4:23] and lay your hands on my sick boy to get
[4:27] healed. He'll be watching you. You must
[4:30] lay hand on the sick and they shall
[4:34] recover. Wow. So God is showing us
[4:39] we are laborers together with
[4:42] him. So Adam, I have done the creation.
[4:46] That is my portion.
[4:48] You do the naming. And the Bible
[4:52] says
[4:55] whatsoever Adam called every living
[4:59] creature
[5:01] that was the name thereof.
[5:07] Wow. Adam had a little creative power in
[5:10] him. Yes sir. Because that is one of the
[5:14] characteristics of the Lord of God.
[5:16] Amen. So that is it. God is showing us
[5:20] that he has his part to play and we have
[5:24] our part to play. That's so powerful.
[5:27] God created the animals and he didn't
[5:30] name them on purpose. He he he did not
[5:34] name them on purpose because he was
[5:36] giving this assignment to his son who
[5:39] was made in the very image and the very
[5:41] likeness of God. Because it will not be
[5:43] God who will be watching over them. It
[5:45] will be his son. It was going to be Adam
[5:47] to be taking watching the animals. Wow.
[5:50] So I guess in some way Adam was reaching
[5:52] into the thoughts of God. He was
[5:54] reaching in to the mind of God because I
[5:57] feel like there must have been an
[5:58] agreement when he named them. We don't
[6:00] read where God said no no that's not
[6:02] what I was going to name it. And that
[6:05] was the name thereof sanction settled
[6:08] period on the end. M so I think uh I
[6:11] think we should be careful then what
[6:13] kind of name we put on something. If you
[6:16] give yourself the name cancer
[6:19] you give your name the you give yourself
[6:21] the name diabetes right that that is
[6:24] what you're naming it then the name
[6:27] shall it shall be that thereof that's it
[6:30] taken captive you are ens snared by your
[6:34] own words. Wow wow wow wow wow wow. So
[6:38] we want to name it something else. We
[6:39] want to we want to name it healed. If
[6:42] cancer comes, give cancer is your name.
[6:45] Yes. Yes. Give him the greatest name.
[6:49] Jesus. Okay. Okay. That's all. That's
[6:51] the solution. I'm filled with Jesus.
[6:54] Hallelujah. Jesus is taking over my
[6:56] life. I'm yielding myself to him. The
[6:59] name of Jesus is above your name.
[7:01] Cancer. Yes
[7:02] sir. M m so in that wonderful name out
[7:06] in the name of Jesus get out of my body
[7:09] you are a trespass because the spirit
[7:10] cancer is a spirit and they know they
[7:14] know that you when you should ask them
[7:17] to go in the name of Jesus they have to
[7:19] go right does this work they have to go
[7:22] does this work for the elderly as well
[7:25] as the young people because sometimes
[7:26] people say well uh the old those who
[7:29] have old age they're going to get sick
[7:31] sickness is just a part of being old. Do
[7:34] they have to accept it because they're
[7:35] age? Why do we become sick? Like you
[7:38] need personal experience with
[7:42] salvation when you are a sinner. Yes.
[7:46] One of the attributes of the Lord is
[7:49] Yahweh Rafa. Mhm. So you need personal
[7:53] experience of his healing power. Yes
[7:57] sir. And that can only come when you are
[8:00] sick. Okay.
[8:02] So when you call upon him and he heals
[8:05] you, then you can come to the church and
[8:08] say, "This is my personal testimony."
[8:12] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He is indeed a
[8:15] healer. Amen. I've heard, but I've
[8:18] experience it. Amen. So then this
[8:21] sickness does not have to be my end, but
[8:24] rather it's an opportunity for God to
[8:27] display manifest his attributes to
[8:29] manifest and display one of his
[8:31] redemptive names. Yes. That he is the
[8:33] healer. Maybe somebody of yours passes
[8:36] on. Mhm. He has an attribute of being a
[8:39] comforter at that time. You need his you
[8:42] don't need him as a savior. Right. You
[8:44] don't need him as a healer. You need him
[8:46] as a comforter. Right. Right. Oh, that
[8:49] is so wonderful. It's so wonderful. Now,
[8:51] the other thing I wanted you to mention
[8:53] is is uh it's kind of a different
[8:55] subject entirely, but I was so touched
[8:59] by the way you brought this out. You
[9:01] were talking to us about the anointing
[9:03] of David by the prophet
[9:05] Samuel. And uh we know that the Bible
[9:08] speaks of Samuel as being a very
[9:10] particular kind of prophet. Yes. Because
[9:12] the Bible saidnone of his words, none of
[9:16] his words fell to the ground. I love
[9:18] that. And so we look at Samuel as a very
[9:21] highlevel prophet of God. Amen. And yet
[9:24] you showed us in the word where Samuel
[9:27] was about to make a mistake perhaps just
[9:31] based on what he saw or what he was
[9:33] thinking. Would you talk about that just
[9:35] a little bit? Because we believe there
[9:37] is a danger in the world today in the
[9:40] body of Christ.
[9:42] especially where people could speak
[9:45] presumptuously in the name of the Lord.
[9:48] And uh you know there's this whole
[9:49] thought that that that some prophets are
[9:52] infallible and there there's just a lot
[9:54] of things here and I think it's
[9:56] important to see Samuel as a man that
[9:59] God was using in a mighty way. So just
[10:01] speak about that a bit. Every man of
[10:03] God, every prophet of God. First of all,
[10:06] they are
[10:07] all a man sent from God. There you go.
[10:13] That's good. And not God sent from God.
[10:17] Right. Another thing about our God is
[10:20] that he will not share his glory no with
[10:25] any man. So any minister you come to a
[10:28] place where you are trying to glorify
[10:32] yourself, God will take you off the
[10:34] scene. Yeah. Let me give you an
[10:37] example. There was a great vision in
[10:41] Matthew
[10:43] 17 when Jesus was transfigured
[10:47] before the
[10:48] people and
[10:50] Moses and Elijah were speaking to him,
[10:54] right?
[10:56] You know what
[10:58] happened? Peter and the Peter and the
[11:01] rest said, "Lord, to be frank, let's
[11:05] make three tabernacles.
[11:08] One for you, one for Moses, one for
[11:11] Elijah. Where do you want to put Jesus
[11:14] in the same
[11:16] category? In the same tabernacle like
[11:19] Moses and Elijah?" No. Right there a
[11:23] voice spoke.
[11:28] This is my beloved son
[11:32] in whom I'm well pleased. Hear ye him.
[11:37] Hear him. What happened to Moses and
[11:39] Elijah? Right? They just faded.
[11:42] And when they woke up of the vision,
[11:46] they saw no man.
[11:48] They didn't see Moses. They didn't see
[11:51] Elijah. Jesus only.
[11:55] Right from
[11:58] Genesis, every man of God
[12:02] made mistake. Yes. People are afraid to
[12:05] say the word mistake. Mhm. You miss and
[12:09] you take something. Yes. That is
[12:10] mistake. Yes. You are taking man to be
[12:13] God. Yes.
[12:16] H only
[12:18] God is
[12:21] infallible. He will allow everyone of
[12:24] his servants to make mistake so that we
[12:30] his children will not put our trust in
[12:34] any man but put our trust in God alone.
[12:39] Amen. Amen. We said it rightly. Samuel.
[12:43] Mhm. Here is Samuel in the scriptures. A
[12:46] prophet of God. Yes.
[12:49] And divine commission. Amen. To begin
[12:51] with, he was afraid to go. But God in
[12:54] the Old Testament is not a fearful God.
[12:56] He's not afraid. So you see the man's
[12:59] side of Samuel. If Saul Saul hears this,
[13:03] I'll be in problem. Is it God speaking?
[13:05] No. No, sir.
[13:08] So he went
[13:09] there
[13:11] and in the 1st
[13:14] Samuel chapter
[13:22] 16 and
[13:25] Jesse made his
[13:28] sons and called them to the
[13:32] sacrifice. And it came to pass when they
[13:34] were come that
[13:38] Samuel the prophet, right? You see,
[13:42] Gentiles, we are crazy
[13:45] people. The
[13:47] Jews, they will stone their prophets.
[13:51] But we Gentiles will worship prophets.
[13:54] Oh my. Gentiles are crazy people. M
[13:59] m
[14:01] Samuel
[14:04] looked an unaliable
[14:08] and he
[14:10] said surely
[14:13] surely the Lord's anointed is before
[14:18] him. So you cannot say that every word
[14:23] from the mouth of Samuel is that say yes
[14:27] the Lord I believe it all. No. No. It's
[14:32] dangerous. It's
[14:35] dangerous. This is on Samuel's tape.
[14:38] Mhm. Yes. And has been printed. Yes. And
[14:42] it was said by Samuel. Yes.
[14:47] But the Lord said unto him, "Look not on
[14:51] his countenance
[14:53] or on the height of his stature because
[14:56] I have refused him." There it is. A
[15:01] prophet.
[15:03] God does not show his prophets
[15:09] everything. No sir. Only God is
[15:13] omnisient. No prophet is all knowing up
[15:17] to today. Right? And if the Lord carries
[15:20] tomorrow, right? I believe you. And no
[15:24] prophet is
[15:25] infinite. Only that glory goes to the
[15:29] Lord. Amen. Who came in the flesh. Amen.
[15:33] Called Lord Jesus Christ. Right?
[15:39] So he was refused.
[15:42] Now they started coming somewhere is not
[15:46] careful.
[15:48] It's a lesson in the Bible. From that
[15:51] moment on, he didn't start speaking
[15:53] before he heard. He waited to hear.
[15:56] Thank you for that.
[15:59] Here is King David. Apart from being a
[16:02] king, he was
[16:04] also a prophet. Mhm.
[16:08] He had his heart's desire. And the Bible
[16:11] says the Lord will give you the desire
[16:13] of your heart. Yes. I want to build a
[16:16] tabernacle to the Lord. Mhm. Nathan,
[16:19] come. Uh-huh. Prophet
[16:21] come. This is my heart's desire. Yes.
[16:25] And Nathan just went and said, "Oh,
[16:27] perform
[16:29] it." Nathan said, "Yes, go do it." Mhm.
[16:34] It seemed good to Nathan. It was
[16:36] recorded on Nathan's sermon book. Yes.
[16:38] Yes. Yes. and printed for distribution.
[16:42] Nathan went back. Now God came down to
[16:46] tell Nathan,
[16:48] "No, go and tell David a different
[16:51] story." These are all examples for us to
[16:54] realize to make man man and God God.
[17:02] So the prophet's opinion is not
[17:05] necessarily thus saith the Lord. Every
[17:07] prophet is human. Mhm. Mhm. They have
[17:10] their opinion to express on any issue.
[17:14] Right. Sure. Let's realize that every
[17:17] prophet is a man, right? Sent from God.
[17:22] Right. Right. Let's permit them to
[17:26] express their human
[17:28] side. Let's permit them. Otherwise, they
[17:32] can't live on earth if everything is not
[17:35] they are humans, right? Of course. And
[17:37] but Abraham is no exception. No, he made
[17:40] it clear. Yes, he did. He made it clear.
[17:43] He certainly did. And because we believe
[17:46] that there are still prophets today
[17:48] according to the five-fold ministry,
[17:50] there are prophetic offices and gifts in
[17:53] the body of Christ. So, anyone who feels
[17:55] that they have this this prophetic
[17:58] insight or the gifts of the Holy Spirit
[18:00] operating, they should be very careful.
[18:04] If you should say something in the name
[18:07] of the Lord which the Lord has not
[18:11] spoken,
[18:13] but Abraham said you should go to hell
[18:15] for that. That's serious. Realize that
[18:18] you are
[18:20] operating within your own spirit. There
[18:23] you go. Good. Good way of explaining the
[18:26] enemy spirit
[18:28] and the spirit of God. Wow. Wow. So care
[18:32] must be taken when we are speaking in
[18:35] the name of the Lord. Amen. Amen. Thank
[18:39] you so much for that wisdom. It was so
[18:42] effective in our church. And uh that's
[18:44] why I'm so thankful to the Lord again
[18:47] for uh letting you be in my life in our
[18:50] lives. We can learn from you. And uh I'm
[18:53] not going to tell people your age. I'm
[18:56] not going to do that. But I'm going to
[18:58] tell them that you have many more years
[19:01] experience on this earth than you look
[19:03] like you do. How about that? Amen. I'll
[19:06] just say that Pastor Tay is a good bit
[19:09] older than what he looks and he has many
[19:11] years of experience and I think we can
[19:14] learn from these powerful words that
[19:16] have been spoken. So again, we were
[19:18] honored to hear from you, pastor. Thank
[19:21] you so much for sharing with us. Thank
[19:23] you for the opportunity and God bless
[19:26] you. God bless you, sir. I'm grateful.
[19:28] Thank you. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye.
[19:32] [Music]
