[43:22] that you have a testimony and we we we
[43:25] like to hear the power in a prophetic
[43:36] testimony yeah do you have the video
[43:39] ready yeah I just want to take a couple
[43:41] of minutes to uh share what I
[43:44] experienced in Ghana I really was not
[43:47] expecting to go to Africa when brother
[43:51] shell asked me to come along uh I really
[43:54] was not expecting it but it was my first
[43:57] T time to
[43:59] Africa and uh it was an incredible
[44:04] experience I wasn't really I had heard I
[44:08] wasn't really realizing what I was
[44:11] getting
[44:12] into you hear a lot of stories about the
[44:15] praise and the worship and about the
[44:17] passion but until you are in the
[44:20] meetings then you realize what it is uh
[44:25] they took so such good care of us it and
[44:30] um and one thing that I noticed about
[44:33] just how they treated brother Shelly
[44:35] Benjamin and I they treated us so well
[44:39] and there was so much respect and they
[44:42] honored Pastor shell like as a man of
[44:46] God
[44:48] and and even Pastor Tay who was over the
[44:50] ministry he showed so much honor the
[44:54] whole
[44:55] time they're not allowed Pastor is not
[44:58] allowed to carry his own Bible and they
[45:00] wanted to carry my bags
[45:02] too and and I actually it touched me the
[45:07] honor that
[45:08] showed and uh and you can see it in the
[45:11] video video because uh Benjamin mention
[45:14] mentions it it is uh an interesting
[45:18] feeling when you are driving towards the
[45:22] church and you're quite a bit a quite a
[45:25] bit away but the worship is just
[45:29] sounding all through the area and it
[45:32] kind of moves you yes and then walking
[45:35] into the building and seeing the passion
[45:38] on the people it was
[45:40] incredible
[45:42] and and so I'm trying to take it all
[45:45] in I'm watching and taking everything in
[45:48] what I'm experiencing seeing the people
[45:51] everybody
[45:54] smiling they were so happy
[45:58] and also I noticed that the worship that
[46:02] they were doing unto God it was life to
[46:10] them and I knew that when they were
[46:13] getting into the presence of God they
[46:15] were getting something just to keep on
[46:20] going and and that is probably one of
[46:24] the most valuable thing that we have
[46:27] when God is everything we
[46:31] need and I and and I was treated very
[46:36] well and a loved being around the people
[46:39] and I got to know uh Isaac Tay Pastor
[46:43] Isaac Tay who is I think the oldest
[46:47] son and uh and I actually when Pastor
[46:51] wasn't with us I would ask him a lot of
[46:53] question and get to know him very well
[46:55] and he was uh an amazing brother and
[46:59] when I was quizzing him you know then I
[47:01] found out that Pastor met him in Holland
[47:05] and gave him a prophetic word that
[47:07] changed the direction of his
[47:09] life and I think pastor had forgotten
[47:12] about it and now he has a flourishing
[47:15] Church in the UK and is also helping his
[47:19] dad like in Ghana I think I asked him uh
[47:24] how often do you come and I think three
[47:26] or four times and spend one month at a
[47:29] each
[47:30] time
[47:32] um and and in the meetings I could see
[47:36] that people were really receiving the
[47:40] everything went so smooth from when we
[47:43] started traveling and all the meetings
[47:46] everything was very well organized and
[47:49] they had great facilities and also what
[47:52] I was seeing in my mind just I'm seeing
[47:55] this big buildings but uh but what I had
[47:58] been hearing it didn't start like that
[48:01] it used to just be a small chart it's
[48:06] church but today it it it's many times
[48:11] bigger than this building and and the
[48:13] meetings were
[48:16] full um one thing that kind of touched
[48:19] me that happened is one of the time and
[48:25] it kind of made me a little bit proud to
[48:28] have a pastor like we do is he gave uh a
[48:34] an alter
[48:36] call and it was about pornography and
[48:41] lust and so he's a visiting minister in
[48:45] a big convention but he couldn't get
[48:48] away from it I could see it he it was
[48:50] heavy on him and he gives an altar
[48:53] call and you would think maybe a handful
[48:55] of people would come
[48:58] but it was a huge
[49:03] crowd but often people don't have the
[49:06] boldness to give a word like
[49:09] that it's a hard word to deliver and
[49:12] there's a lot of Shame around
[49:14] pornography and
[49:16] lust but when the Holy Ghost is there he
[49:19] wants to set us free from these
[49:22] things um and so we are going to play a
[49:26] video and I always have it in my heart
[49:29] I've always wanted to do is to do to do
[49:34] like a little bit of video so we can see
[49:37] what a mission trip looks
[49:40] like and I just took with me the church
[49:44] bought a tiny little camera and the
[49:46] whole thing is just filmed on a tiny
[49:48] little camera because my camera is kind
[49:51] of big and some of the church's cameras
[49:53] are big with a big uh like a Gimbal and
[49:57] I didn't want to you
[49:59] know look too
[50:03] obvious and be in people's faces with a
[50:06] huge camera but it turned out pretty
[50:10] good quality-wise
[50:12] and uh and so I hope you can see a
[50:15] little bit what went on and I hope you
[50:19] enjoy footage
[50:22] ever got on a mission trip yeah maybe
[50:25] turn off the lights quality is
[50:27] incredible but the artistic ability of
[50:31] our brother is
[50:34] [Music]
[50:44] [Music]
[50:50] outstanding to wear banana from
[50:56] [Music]
[51:00] oh
[51:07] [Music]
[51:32] many at times we have a lot of men of
[51:36] God and they feed the congregation and
[51:40] sometimes if I say when we we take it to
[51:43] food we can eat so much rice but we need
[51:48] somebody who will come and add flavor
[51:50] and vegetables to it with a unique
[51:52] Ministry and that is what Pastor Shel
[51:54] has brought into the message and into
[51:57] Bible Believers Fellowship he has
[51:59] brought a balance in the word mixing the
[52:03] prophetic with teaching and and and
[52:06] demonstration of power Miracles SS and
[52:09] wonders and this has really transformed
[52:12] the ministry and and and expanded the
[52:15] work of God down here in Africa it's
[52:18] opened our eyes to many things that God
[52:21] can do not only a one-sided Ministry but
[52:25] a prophetic has G giving us insight to
[52:28] who God is and what God has given to us
[52:31] and how we can bring the Kingdom of
[52:33] Heaven upon this Earth to walk the
[52:35] kingdom
[52:36] mandate just a few short days ago dad
[52:39] Hawk and myself lered in Ghana West
[52:41] Africa we've taken a short drive over to
[52:44] TMA where our hotel is and where the
[52:46] meetings are going to be held just just
[52:48] a short distance over there we're really
[52:51] excited to be here the expectation of
[52:53] the people is high and we're also
[52:55] expecting for ourselves this is my third
[52:57] time here and every time it seems to get
[52:59] better and better the atmosphere of the
[53:02] building is electric when you pull onto
[53:03] the property and then you go inside and
[53:05] it's even more electric with the worship
[53:08] we're just super excited for what the
[53:09] Lord is going to do
[53:32] h
[53:56] s man of
[53:59] God all the way from Alabama and there
[54:02] there's there's a new I learn

[55:01] BL
[55:15] [Music]
[55:20] [Music]
[55:28] [Music]
[55:33] my name is Isaac Benjamin K I met Pastor
[55:36] Shelly when I was a teenager when he
[55:38] came he first came to Ghana we had this
[55:41] major convention and I was a tiny little
[55:44] boy playing keyboard and backing him on
[55:48] songs and I used to shiver when he's
[55:51] playing cuz I was scared of the crowd
[55:53] but with time I I got over rap
[55:57] [Music]
[56:11] [Music]
[56:24] and along the way um I met Pastor Shelly
[56:27] again in Amsterdam and he gave me a word
[56:31] of Prophecy that you are pursuing
[56:33] business management but the Lord has a
[56:36] higher calling for you and afterwards
[56:39] about 3 years later the Lord began to
[56:41] speak I moved out of Holland to UK and
[56:45] um through UK I've been to many cities
[56:48] but when the right time came the Lord
[56:50] relocated me to wampton
[56:53] specifically to start the ministry God
[56:55] to him PR Center and the Bible Believers
[57:03] Fellowship son but many sons are coming
[57:07] to maturity under the Dynamics of the
[57:10] resurrection power of
[57:13] [Applause]
[57:15] Jesus
[57:17] hallelujah
[57:19] [Applause]
[57:24] hallelujah I declare that in Jesus name
[57:28] it is
[57:30] possible I will recover all that Satan
[57:35] has stolen from
[57:37] me in the name of Jesus
[57:42] [Applause]
[57:42] [Music]
[57:44] Christ
[57:45] hallel I
[57:48] receive I receive it
[57:57] and when I was after I received the Holy
[58:00] Ghost I started ministering at 7 and I
[58:04] was pastoring at
[58:06] 17 so you are never too young to be used
[58:11] of the Lord and I want to encourage
[58:14] every one of you to give your lives to
[58:17] Jesus now my name is David shishi AA I
[58:22] am the youth pastor at bible Believers
[58:24] Fellowship teror I believe that that
[58:26] generally people who came in for the
[58:30] convention everybody would go back with
[58:33] a personal testimony I have had my
[58:36] personal testimony because there are
[58:38] many questions on my mind the Lord has
[58:41] answered now the spiritual side I've
[58:45] received a great impartation I'm going
[58:48] back into Ministry with greater
[58:51] knowledge um a higher spiritual level
[58:54] and I believe it is so for many other
[58:56] people too now many people came from
[58:59] different parts of Ghana and the
[59:01] testimonies they are going back with the
[59:03] healing of the infirmities in their
[59:06] bodies then the deliverance from um
[59:10] demonic forces oppression and all of
[59:14] these I I believe it's been a great an
[59:16] awesome time in the presence of God you
[59:19] know we know that nobody comes into the
[59:22] presence of the Lord and Lees the same
[59:24] we know that but at Easter 2024 meetings
[59:28] we saw
[59:41] [Music]
[59:52] it there was an overflow of Joy where
[59:56] people could express the the Liberty
[59:58] they have in Christ they could dance
[1:00:00] without thinking of what others think
[1:00:02] about them they could scream and shout
[1:00:05] and I tell you Bible Believers and the
[1:00:07] Easter meetings we had shouting dancing
[1:00:11] jumping clapping was our daily dose of
[1:00:14] medicine it was awesome we had pastors
[1:00:18] from Kenya ruanda Togo
[1:00:22] Nigeria myself from United Kingdom we
[1:00:26] had um Brethren from USA we had um
[1:00:30] Pastor Shel himself and the wonderful
[1:00:33] team from USA and we had another servant
[1:00:37] of God from the USA and a few across the
[1:00:40] continent of Africa I will say that they
[1:00:43] travel to honor the unique gift that God
[1:00:47] has placed in this end time in the early
[1:00:50] church the disciples traveled to
[1:00:52] Jerusalem because there was something
[1:00:54] unique there and when it comes to Pastor
[1:00:57] Shelley he's a unique gift to the body
[1:00:59] of Christ and he is very scarce he's a
[1:01:02] red gem we say he's one in a million so
[1:01:05] when we get the opportunity for him to
[1:01:07] come down because we are in close
[1:01:10] proximity we have to travel to come and
[1:01:12] benefit from his ministry and that is
[1:01:15] why we all troop in to sit under his
[1:01:17] ministry to be empowered to be ignited
[1:01:20] and to be set on fire for the Lord
[1:01:24] [Music]
[1:01:36] praise the Lord
[1:01:49] amen we are blessed to be a part of this
[1:01:51] unique
[1:01:52] Ministry and we're blessed that we can
[1:01:55] send him to the world I was there one
[1:02:01] time and it is a lifechanging
[1:02:04] experience and uh we don't want to make
[1:02:10] you
[1:02:11] African but we want you to Worship the
[1:02:16] Lord and we sure don't want to make them
[1:02:19] like the American
[1:02:22] church I mean I've traveled enough to
[1:02:24] know pastors that that's what they want
[1:02:26] to do they want to make everybody as
[1:02:28] dead as their
[1:02:30] church and I don't want that I want
[1:02:33] there to be freedom in the
[1:02:35] spirit why don't we give the Lord a
[1:02:37] praise for this testimony for what God
[1:02:40] did and continues to
[1:02:48] do he is continuing to
[1:02:52] work um Mariah did Charity give you you
[1:02:56] a few pictures that we can show um
[1:03:00] turning our mind now to the project
[1:03:03] down
[1:03:07] below can you
[1:03:10] um is that the first one we got that's
[1:03:12] with who was working
[1:03:16] yesterday I wanted you to see the how
[1:03:19] many do you
[1:03:20] have we're going
[1:03:23] backwards there I want want you to see
[1:03:26] that it it's not just slapping some
[1:03:28] metal on the side of the building um
[1:03:31] first the the the uprights and then the
[1:03:34] uh boards that go sideways with the uh
[1:03:38] foil foam panels that go in there and
[1:03:42] then the metal panels that go on over
[1:03:44] top of that and so the entire front of
[1:03:48] the building uh that we wanted to
[1:03:51] complete there which is 2/3 because we
[1:03:53] don't know what we're going to do yet
[1:03:55] with the thirdd so that is now got the
[1:03:58] metal completely across it and so we
[1:04:01] just want you to know that work goes on
[1:04:04] there many days of the week beautiful
[1:04:07] even though it uh you may not see what
[1:04:10] is happening but work is happening and
[1:04:13] so we're just so grateful for what the
[1:04:16] Lord is providing and so we want to come
[1:04:19] to you today for an offering to uh our
[1:04:23] next big step is to be able to spray
[1:04:26] foam into this into the roof the ceiling
[1:04:30] of the building uh it will do much
[1:04:33] better at uh prohibiting the heat
[1:04:37] penetration that comes through that
[1:04:39] metal roof more so than the um
[1:04:42] fiberglass that typically gets put in
[1:04:45] the in the ceilings so we want to spray
[1:04:48] 5 and 1 12 Ines into the ceiling the
[1:04:50] roof of that building and then it has
[1:04:54] been recommended that we also uh spray a
[1:04:58] fire retardant paint over top of that
[1:05:01] and so it's going to cost in the
[1:05:04] vicinity of
[1:05:06] $10,000 and I only say in the vicinity
[1:05:09] because we added 3et I don't know what
[1:05:12] those extra square feet are going to
[1:05:14] cost there is approximately
[1:05:17] $7,000 in that account right now so if
[1:05:20] you brought an offering today we want to
[1:05:23] give you an opportunity to give that and
[1:05:27] uh before I call on somebody to hold the
[1:05:29] offering bag we want to mention that uh
[1:05:32] brother Shelley's birthday is coming up
[1:05:35] uh on April the 28th but some of his
[1:05:38] family is going to be gone so he is we
[1:05:40] are postponing the picnic for his
[1:05:43] birthday his birthday celebration to the

[1:05:52] celebration for brother Shelley who is

[1:15:24] is that where I want to be amen I don't
[1:15:27] want to be caught Anywhere But Where God
[1:15:29] would desire for us to be in such an
[1:15:31] hour as this this is the last days we
[1:15:35] are living in the last days we may never
[1:15:38] finish that that Fellowship Hall May
[1:15:41] Never finish we're that close to the
[1:15:44] coming of the Lord you can say Amen or
[1:15:46] oh me but the Bible is what's telling us
[1:15:49] the truth did you realize that we are
[1:15:52] that close that what has transpired
[1:15:55] overnight could I don't believe it's
[1:15:57] going to just yet but it could
[1:16:00] absolutely lead us into World War
[1:16:02] I which will not be a normal War it'll
[1:16:05] be a nuclear war and uh I want you all
[1:16:09] to know that the east coast of the
[1:16:11] United States would be a Target anywhere
[1:16:13] from Pensacola to Fort
[1:16:15] Benning to the to Air Force again in
[1:16:19] near Atlanta we are we are in the Target
[1:16:23] Zone and we don't need to be fearful we
[1:16:26] need to be
[1:16:28] faithful we need to know that we know
[1:16:30] that we know that we know that we don't
[1:16:32] have to go to somebody in the middle of
[1:16:34] the night and
[1:16:35] repent we've repented we've asked
[1:16:38] forgiveness of one another we've got
[1:16:40] everything under the
[1:16:42] blood I you know I was sitting there
[1:16:44] thinking uh our life
[1:16:47] testifies the life that we live I
[1:16:50] wouldn't want to be be here this morning
[1:16:52] looking back over my life and realizing
[1:16:55] I had lived for
[1:16:58] myself we're that close to the coming of
[1:17:01] the Lord I would want to know that I
[1:17:03] have lived it for the Lord and if you
[1:17:07] haven't you can you can start now and
[1:17:11] you can give God your everything he's
[1:17:13] not going to take your
[1:17:15] leftovers no he's not interested in your
[1:17:18] leftovers he wants to be your first love
[1:17:21] if you'll make Jesus your first love and
[1:17:25] you'll love him and you'll love his
[1:17:27] house and you'll and you'll love his
[1:17:29] people and you'll love his word you'll
[1:17:32] come out on top every time every time
[1:17:36] how do you know because I've lived it
[1:17:38] and I know what God can do I want to say
[1:17:41] again Hawk you did an outstanding
[1:17:47] job
[1:17:49] hours of footage hours of footage to be
[1:17:53] able to reduce it to 11 minutes and show
[1:17:56] you what you saw this morning we are
[1:17:59] extremely blessed reach over and get
[1:18:02] your bibles if you will and and turn
[1:18:05] with me there's just so much that we
[1:18:09] would like to to cover this morning but
[1:18:11] we we know we don't have time to do
[1:18:14] that uh there were couple people who had
[1:18:17] special songs and we apologize to you
[1:18:20] that we weren't able to use those songs
[1:18:21] this morning we knew that with the
[1:18:23] special offering with the video and the
[1:18:25] presentation of Ghana that we wouldn't
[1:18:28] be able to do that but please don't take
[1:18:30] it personal it's always a blessing to us
[1:18:32] when people want to sing for the glory
[1:18:34] of God we're blessed by it especially
[1:18:37] when they have had time to to meet with
[1:18:39] the band because it's more than a piano
[1:18:42] it's it's keeping the Rhythm and the
[1:18:44] bead and the drums and the guitars and
[1:18:47] and everything and uh we're just
[1:18:49] thankful this morning that when someone
[1:18:51] is out like Ben was out today with his
[1:18:54] family on a little holiday we're just so
[1:18:56] thankful that Josh can step up and David
[1:18:59] can step up and different ones can move
[1:19:01] up to another instrument and do whatever
[1:19:03] they need to do uh to make it and we're
[1:19:07] believing that soon we're going to have
[1:19:09] another keyboardist among us we have
[1:19:11] been blessed over a period of time with
[1:19:15] our brother I won't even call his name
[1:19:17] now I'll let him do do his own testimony
[1:19:20] but God has moved for him this week he's
[1:19:23] had a miracle this this week and uh the
[1:19:26] Lord spoke prophetically you may not
[1:19:29] know it was prophetically but he knew it
[1:19:32] the Lord spoke prophetically last Sunday
[1:19:34] and within four days God had done his
[1:19:37] part that's the God we serve so it may
[1:19:41] not be as outstanding as we would like
[1:19:43] yet but we can say Bible days are here
[1:19:47] again we're going to have a book of Acts
[1:19:51] Church we're going to have a book of
[1:19:53] Acts Church
[1:19:55] and uh we do have but not the fullness
[1:19:59] yet you heard the song This bride is not
[1:20:02] walking in her total Victory yet amen I
[1:20:05] thought when they called brother Austin
[1:20:07] up here to to hold the offering bag he's
[1:20:10] about to be a dad
[1:20:12] again within a few hours maybe a day or
[1:20:16] so sooner the better for sister Anna
[1:20:18] she's ready God has performed miracles
[1:20:22] for her every time there has been an
[1:20:26] alarm prayer has been offered up they
[1:20:28] have believed God and God has moved
[1:20:31] every time the doctors have been extra
[1:20:35] cautious because of what she has gone
[1:20:37] through uh with Gwyn and uh could have
[1:20:40] been could have been life altering for
[1:20:42] all of them it was in fact really life
[1:20:45] altering but God has moved each time we
[1:20:48] know he's going to move this week if
[1:20:50] this is the week then we know that God
[1:20:52] is going to be with them uh to Tuesday
[1:20:55] is Sister Sandy man's birthday so let's
[1:20:58] say happy birthday to Sister
[1:21:01] [Applause]
[1:21:03] Sandy we love
[1:21:05] her our love for her
[1:21:08] increases even though she
[1:21:13] decreases she's not near Brother David
[1:21:16] she's not near the woman she
[1:21:18] was but God is good and she's feeling
[1:21:21] healthier and that's what matters and

[1:23:15] reason why we gather and uh what a
[1:23:18] weekend we had last weekend Oh My we had

[1:23:24] testimonies that came in from our

[1:23:31] church
[1:23:32] full and uh when it's not camp meeting

[1:23:40] past year and we had to put out chairs
[1:23:43] uh Saturday and Sunday and God was good
[1:23:47] and we had a wonderful Fellowship we had
[1:23:49] wonderful food and we had a testimony
[1:23:51] come in that God moved for one brother
[1:23:53] who was Des desperate to have a touch
[1:23:55] from the Lord and God ministered to him
[1:23:58] and it was a profound nature and we're
[1:24:00] very thankful all the glory Belongs to
[1:24:03] the Lord amen so much to thank him for
[1:24:07] Isaiah 52 beginning in verse one awake
[1:24:13] awake put on your strength oh
[1:24:18] Zion put on thy beautiful
[1:24:21] garments oh Jerusalem the holy city for
[1:24:26] henceforth there shall no more come into
[1:24:30] Thee the
[1:24:32] uncircumcised and the unclean we'd like
[1:24:35] to say neither your ballistic missiles
[1:24:38] or your
[1:24:39] drones nothing we woke this morning to a
[1:24:43] picture of the of the leftover of a
[1:24:46] missile floating in the Dead Sea that's
[1:24:49] a good place for it causing no harm to
[1:24:52] anyone but floating there in the Dead
[1:24:55] Sea not too far from from from inbo kick
[1:24:58] kick kick or kick where we have been
[1:25:00] many times God's looking after his
[1:25:03] people amen the next verse Shake
[1:25:08] Yourself Shake yourself from the dust
[1:25:12] arise and sit down oh Jerusalem loose
[1:25:17] thyself from the bands of thy neck oh
[1:25:21] captive Daughter of Zion for thus says
[1:25:25] the Lord you have sold yourselves for
[1:25:28] nothing and you shall be redeemed
[1:25:31] without money I want you to go with me
[1:25:34] to Isaiah
[1:25:37] 49 verse 14 through
[1:25:41] 16 and then we'll we'll let you have
[1:25:43] your seat but Zion said the Lord hath
[1:25:48] forsaken me and my Lord hath forgotten
[1:25:53] me have you ever felt that way be honest
[1:25:56] be
[1:25:57] honest can a woman forget her sucking
[1:26:00] child that she should not have
[1:26:02] compassion on the son of her womb yay
[1:26:06] they may
[1:26:08] forget yet will I not
[1:26:13] forget thee do you hear that yes it's
[1:26:16] possible that a nursing mother be able
[1:26:20] to forget her sucking child but God says
[1:26:23] to Israel
[1:26:24] I will never forget you that's to
[1:26:29] Natural Israel and to spiritual Israel I
[1:26:32] will never forget thee behold I have
[1:26:37] Graven
[1:26:39] Thee I have engraved thee that's not a
[1:26:42] tattoo by the
[1:26:44] way I have Graven thee upon the palms of
[1:26:49] my hand the word actually means carved
[1:26:55] I have carved you upon the palms of my
[1:26:58] hands thy
[1:27:00] walls are
[1:27:03] continually before me God is saying if I
[1:27:07] wanted to forget you I
[1:27:10] can't every time I see my own hand I see
[1:27:15] you and I think of you don't we have
[1:27:17] something to be thankful for now Lord we
[1:27:20] need you today you came to us last SU
[1:27:24] Sunday our time is a little more limited
[1:27:27] today but you're not limited you can
[1:27:30] come in the time that we have and you
[1:27:33] can show yourself God almighty God
[1:27:36] strong God the same still able to
[1:27:41] deliver still able to save still able to
[1:27:45] set free and we will give you the glory
[1:27:48] and the honor and the praise for it's in
[1:27:50] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[1:27:52] pray and the Saints said amen you may be
[1:27:56] seated the word for walls if you'll put
[1:27:59] that verse up the word for walls thy
[1:28:03] walls are continually before me it
[1:28:07] literally means joined to a
[1:28:11] wall God is telling us he's telling
[1:28:16] natural Israel he's telling spiritual
[1:28:19] Israel now when we refer to spiritual
[1:28:23] Israel we're referring to one new
[1:28:26] man you see God says to us in the New
[1:28:30] Covenant there is neither Jew nor Greek
[1:28:34] there is neither Jew nor Gentile in the
[1:28:37] New Covenant in the New Covenant We Are
[1:28:39] All One new man that means that we have
[1:28:43] become sons of God and of sons of God he
[1:28:47] no longer deals with the redeemed under
[1:28:50] another Covenant he has made a covenant
[1:28:53] and fulfilled filled every requirement
[1:28:56] of the law by sending us
[1:28:58] Messiah that doesn't mean that we throw
[1:29:01] away the Commandments of the Lord it
[1:29:03] doesn't mean that at all in fact Matthew
[1:29:05] tells us that Jesus did not come to
[1:29:08] destroy the law he came to fill it
[1:29:12] up let me tell you something he's enough
[1:29:16] I'd like for somebody to say Jesus is
[1:29:19] enough we love this time of year we love
[1:29:23] Passover we love everything that it
[1:29:25] symbolizes but it's Jesus in every part
[1:29:28] of it when you hold the matah in your
[1:29:31] hand it's both pierced and
[1:29:34] striped isn't it and that tells us our
[1:29:38] Messiah according to Isaiah's prophecy
[1:29:41] would be both pierced and
[1:29:45] striped when when a piece is hidden and
[1:29:48] later brought out the aacom it
[1:29:52] represents our Lord being hidden away in
[1:29:54] the grave coming back fulfilling the
[1:29:58] Feast of first fruits with the
[1:30:01] Resurrection Life waved over the heads
[1:30:04] of the people we will at some point I
[1:30:08] don't know that we'll get to it this
[1:30:10] morning we'll refer to the red heer
[1:30:13] offering and Jesus is
[1:30:15] there the Scarlet the hisp the blood of
[1:30:19] the red heer that's that's
[1:30:21] Messiah every offering
[1:30:24] every sacrifice every element of both
[1:30:27] Tabernacle and Temple points us to the
[1:30:32] reality so remember when you hold on to
[1:30:36] the type you must also embrace the
[1:30:39] reality you don't do away with typology
[1:30:42] or symbology but you don't reject the
[1:30:45] Fulfillment either you you closly love
[1:30:49] and affirm who Messiah is in our lives
[1:30:54] and so we as a part of the one new man
[1:30:57] we Are Spiritual Israel that's not
[1:31:00] replacement theology by the way there's
[1:31:04] not even a small part of our doctrine
[1:31:06] that says that the church has replaced
[1:31:09] Israel that's actually Baptist Doctrine
[1:31:12] it's actually Methodist Doctrine but
[1:31:15] it's not Bible Doctrine the church did
[1:31:18] not replace Israel neither natural nor
[1:31:21] spiritual but according to Romans
[1:31:23] chapter 11 we were
[1:31:26] what grafted in to the Commonwealth of
[1:31:30] Israel so all of the life that God has
[1:31:33] promised to Israel you and I are also
[1:31:36] the
[1:31:37] beneficiaries so we Are Spiritual Israel
[1:31:40] so God is saying to us through the
[1:31:43] prophet Isaiah that I have joined myself
[1:31:48] to you that word walls there means
[1:31:51] joined to a wall
[1:31:54] God is telling us that he has joined
[1:31:58] himself to us even in our
[1:32:01] captivity Even in our sin Even in our
[1:32:05] Rebellion how many of you know he was
[1:32:07] watching over
[1:32:08] us on drugs on in sin promiscuous life
[1:32:15] and yet he said I've joined myself to
[1:32:17] you you're mine you were always mine you
[1:32:20] will always be mine that's the Word of
[1:32:22] Promise To Us
[1:32:24] and so a as brother gley mentioned I
[1:32:27] think this morning that old past or or
[1:32:29] or the prayer someone mentioned this
[1:32:32] morning that old life RJ I think that
[1:32:36] old life is so far gone it's so far
[1:32:39] removed from who we are
[1:32:42] today that that the Bible actually tells
[1:32:45] us and then the message of the hour came
[1:32:47] along on top of that and said you you
[1:32:49] never did it in the first place what
[1:32:53] Grace is is that that it's completely
[1:32:56] wiped out of the memory of a God who
[1:33:00] cannot forget unless he chooses to
[1:33:02] forget how many of you are glad that he
[1:33:05] has chosen to forget some
[1:33:08] stuff sir you're not shouting out like
[1:33:11] people who are
[1:33:13] grateful I'm going to tell you what they
[1:33:15] tell people in Ghana your amen is not
[1:33:18] born
[1:33:19] again you need to get your amen born
[1:33:22] again this morning God has chosen to
[1:33:26] forget a whole lot of things he knew
[1:33:29] about
[1:33:31] you Hallelujah Redemption is more than
[1:33:36] just forgiveness of sin Redemption is to
[1:33:39] be taken back to the original thoughts
[1:33:43] of God concerning your life so no matter
[1:33:47] what you've done or how long you have
[1:33:50] spent spinning your wheel
[1:33:54] no matter how long you spent on the
[1:33:57] gerbal
[1:33:58] wheel of
[1:34:00] performance trying to earn your
[1:34:03] salvation God looks over all of that he
[1:34:06] said you didn't need to waste those days
[1:34:09] but I'm a redeemer of
[1:34:11] time so as soon as you come to the
[1:34:14] revelation of who I am you'll re you'll
[1:34:17] you'll also have a revelation of who you
[1:34:19] are because of who I am yes sir come on
[1:34:24] and I will redeem the
[1:34:30] ears we're blessed people yes we are the
[1:34:34] word has set us free yes sir so he says
[1:34:38] to
[1:34:39] us I am joined to
[1:34:42] you like a
[1:34:45] wall so when it feels like the walls are
[1:34:49] closing in on us he is experienced ing
[1:34:54] the same thing that we are experiencing
[1:34:58] somebody said I need that in the New
[1:35:00] Testament I'm glad you do the New
[1:35:02] Testament says he is
[1:35:05] touched with the feelings yes sir of our
[1:35:10] infirmities so when you hit a roadblock
[1:35:13] he does too yes sir that doesn't mean he
[1:35:16] can't move Beyond he's the only one that
[1:35:18] can but it means he feels your
[1:35:20] roadblock when you get stuck in the BL
[1:35:24] he feels you're stuck come on when you
[1:35:29] get weary and discouraged he feels your
[1:35:32] weariness yes sir he feels your
[1:35:35] discouragement the good thing is he's
[1:35:38] not a job's
[1:35:40] comforter he didn't just come to tell
[1:35:42] you why you got to where you are he came
[1:35:45] to do something about it aren't you glad
[1:35:48] you serve a god who's able to do
[1:35:52] something about it
[1:35:54] [Applause]
[1:35:55] he's touched with the feeling of our
[1:35:58] infirmities all through the word we see
[1:36:01] God joining himself to the struggles of
[1:36:06] his
[1:36:07] servants even his
[1:36:11] disobedient
[1:36:12] Servants of which there must be some
[1:36:16] among
[1:36:18] us because if there's ever been a time
[1:36:21] in your life that you have not obeyed
[1:36:24] the Lord you've been a disobedient
[1:36:27] servant and you can wallow around in
[1:36:30] your sorrow and in your in your
[1:36:33] discouragement in your condemnation or
[1:36:36] you can choose like a captive Daughter
[1:36:38] of Zion get
[1:36:40] up awake awake put on your strength o
[1:36:45] Zion Shake yourself from the dust so God
[1:36:51] is always joining himself to the
[1:36:53] struggles of even his disobedient
[1:36:56] servants it's the one it's one of the
[1:36:58] most comforting and encouraging pictures
[1:37:01] that we have of the care that God has
[1:37:04] for his children and we have it all the
[1:37:06] way through the Bible are you with me
[1:37:08] consider
[1:37:10] Jacob you remember Jacob Yakov he later
[1:37:13] became Israel he was a very disobedient
[1:37:16] child of God he was an anointed servant
[1:37:21] whose sins brought him and his family to
[1:37:25] rock bottom bottom it was at
[1:37:28] bethl that God appeared to him
[1:37:32] supernaturally it was here that he saw a
[1:37:35] ladder reaching into the heavens and
[1:37:38] Angels who were both ascending the
[1:37:40] ladder and descending the ladder is't
[1:37:43] that good yes sir God's got your prayers
[1:37:45] going up and the aners coming down even
[1:37:49] in Jacob's Disobedience God wanted him
[1:37:52] to know I still hear you I still see you
[1:37:56] I'm still aware of what you're going
[1:37:59] through now get up yes sir get up get up
[1:38:04] you you see that greasy Grace Church
[1:38:08] they want a savior who comes with
[1:38:11] sympathy and and kind of leaves you in
[1:38:14] that place of of just
[1:38:17] existing but the god of the Bible the
[1:38:20] grace message of the Bible is not one
[1:38:23] that wants to leave you in your place of
[1:38:25] sympathy he doesn't want to leave you in
[1:38:28] your pity
[1:38:29] party he said hey I've come to you I
[1:38:33] joined myself to you and now I want you
[1:38:37] to get
[1:38:40] up I want you to get up yes cuz I'm here
[1:38:43] for you you're not alone when you're
[1:38:46] down and you're not alone when you're
[1:38:48] getting up I'm with you through your
[1:38:51] Downs setting I'm with you through your
[1:38:54] Uprising I'm with you when the bills are
[1:38:57] paid I'm I'm with you when the when the
[1:39:02] decline when you get the
[1:39:04] decline sir when they say sorry
[1:39:07] ma'am yes sir your card has been
[1:39:10] declined God's still there he's still
[1:39:13] God come on he was God when you were
[1:39:20] overspending now you don't have what you
[1:39:22] need he's still
[1:39:24] God he said if you'll give me my part
[1:39:27] that's all I'm asking God said if you'll
[1:39:30] give me my part not when you can afford
[1:39:34] to on now not when you paid everything
[1:39:38] else first God said you give me my part
[1:39:42] first and I will pour an
[1:39:45] oil on everything that is
[1:39:48] left
[1:39:50] amen somebody said but we don't have a
[1:39:52] temple God does have a temple and you're
[1:39:55] the
[1:39:56] temple you are the temple so you give
[1:40:00] God what belongs to God and he promises
[1:40:03] to take what's left and make it more
[1:40:06] than what it was in the beginning and
[1:40:09] many of us can testify without any
[1:40:13] stutter that God is
[1:40:15] faithful oh he's faithful even brother
[1:40:19] Daniel was testifying to me this week on
[1:40:22] the telephone that that in all this
[1:40:24] that's gone on in his life and this loss
[1:40:26] and this accident and what could have
[1:40:28] been but God was in the arrangements and
[1:40:30] he's working to recover sir and as you
[1:40:34] if you heard if you heard the preacher
[1:40:36] say on the video we're serving a God who
[1:40:39] says you can recover
[1:40:43] all give God what's his and keep your
[1:40:46] spirit right you want to know the favor
[1:40:49] of the Lord you want to know the
[1:40:50] blessing of the Lord number one give God
[1:40:52] what belongs to him number two keep your
[1:40:55] rotten Spirit
[1:40:57] right correct yourself let him restore
[1:41:02] to you the joy of your
[1:41:05] salvation serving God is where it's at I
[1:41:10] mean with everything you've got yes sir
[1:41:12] so Jacob had some things to
[1:41:14] learn he saw the Lord in Genesis
[1:41:18] 28:15 he saw Angel the ladder and Angels
[1:41:22] descending and ascending
[1:41:24] he heard God speak to him in an audible
[1:41:27] voice which is profound and precious God
[1:41:31] said in 28:15 I am with thee I think you
[1:41:35] might have that I am with thee and will
[1:41:38] keep thee in all places whether thou
[1:41:45] goest yes sir it's a
[1:41:50] backslider God said I'll keep you I'll
[1:41:53] go with you wherever you go I will bring
[1:41:56] thee
[1:41:57] again into this land I will not leave
[1:42:01] thee listen here I will not leave thee
[1:42:04] until I have done that which I have
[1:42:07] spoken of
[1:42:09] thee everything I told I'm going to do
[1:42:12] it you're in no position to receive it
[1:42:15] right now but I'm going to bring you
[1:42:17] back to the land I'm going to bring you
[1:42:19] back to the promise so here's what God
[1:42:22] did God Jo joined himself to Jacob even
[1:42:26] in Jacob's backslidden condition God
[1:42:29] joined himself to Jacob his enslaved son
[1:42:34] and pledged he would never be dissuaded
[1:42:39] from fulfilling his word concerning
[1:42:42] Jacob I'm going to keep my word you're
[1:42:45] not doing like you ought to do but I'm
[1:42:46] going I'm going to do like I ought to
[1:42:51] do in Genesis 2 8: 16 and 17 it says and
[1:42:55] Jacob awake out of his sleep and he said
[1:42:58] surely the
[1:43:00] Lord is in this place uh you read the
[1:43:04] rest I knew it not I wonder how many

[1:44:01] that allergies are not

[1:51:49] and preacher preaching his heart out
[1:51:55] but next Saturday they can wave their
[1:51:57] Flags scream for their
[1:52:00] God but they come if they get to church
[1:52:03] at
[1:52:04] all can't squeeze out an
[1:52:06] amen come on this world's in trouble
[1:52:09] folks it brings me no pleasure if you
[1:52:12] think it brings me pleasure to preach
[1:52:14] like that it brings me no pleasure at
[1:52:17] all to have to preach like that the
[1:52:19] world around us is in trouble we have no
[1:52:21] excuse to be like them we have no excuse
[1:52:24] to follow the ways of the world we have
[1:52:26] no excuse to follow Babylon we have no
[1:52:29] excuse to be caught up in the Pagan mess
[1:52:32] around
[1:52:33] us and only think of God when times are
[1:52:37] tough
[1:52:39] on when we get bad news on when there's
[1:52:44] nothing else to think about wow 20 years
[1:52:48] he wormed around God said I'm going to
[1:52:51] bring you back to this land
[1:52:52] I'm going to keep my promise to you
[1:52:54] doesn't it sound like he'd have been the
[1:52:56] first to get in
[1:52:58] line hey I want it all give me the
[1:53:01] mountain give me my promise give me my
[1:53:04] inheritance but he crawled away from
[1:53:07] bethl and spent 20 more years worming
[1:53:10] his way through
[1:53:12] life I think that reality hit me this
[1:53:15] morning as I was sitting here I couldn't
[1:53:19] stand my listen I am 50
[1:53:23] six years old might as well say and if
[1:53:26] you are 56 and you're not in touch with
[1:53:28] your
[1:53:29] mortality it's time for you to get in
[1:53:31] touch with your
[1:53:33] mortality it's time for you to realize
[1:53:36] that you're not promised to be
[1:53:38] 85 you look around and see sister uh Flo
[1:53:42] and sister Willams and sister ger and
[1:53:45] and they're living toward 90 and you you
[1:53:47] know you just assume well I want you to
[1:53:49] know that you have you do not have the
[1:53:52] the
[1:53:53] promise we don't know if we're going to
[1:53:55] make it that long a former Deacon of
[1:53:58] this church passed away this week
[1:54:02] unexpectedly at the age of
[1:54:07] 65 far as I know the the obituary now
[1:54:11] reads unexpectedly brother AER Danny AER
[1:54:16] one of the sweetest men I ever
[1:54:18] knew 65
[1:54:20] years a far as I know without
[1:54:23] disease may be a heart attack says
[1:54:27] unexpectedly so that leads me to believe
[1:54:30] there was no horrible diagnosis from the
[1:54:32] doctor nobody was tending to his bedside
[1:54:36] feeding him in
[1:54:38] sure it just sounds
[1:54:42] like said with his family with his in
[1:54:45] his home in the comfort of his home is
[1:54:48] how the obituary
[1:54:49] read so if I were to look at that at
[1:54:53] 56 and and look at
[1:54:56] 65 and think of the reality that I could
[1:54:59] only have 9 years or less on this Earth
[1:55:04] and and you think for one minute that
[1:55:07] I'm stupid enough to want to spend that
[1:55:10] nine years worming
[1:55:14] around and leaving the promises of God
[1:55:17] on the vine when they're mine for the
[1:55:21] picking
[1:55:24] [Applause]
[1:55:26] no sir I want everything that God has
[1:55:31] promised me in my life yes sir
[1:55:35] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:55:38] hallelujah and I don't just want it for

[1:56:05] Spirit he heard it with his
[1:56:08] ear audibly telling him what I want to
[1:56:11] do for
[1:56:13] you in 20 years went by Jacob un
[1:56:20] unchanged years of trial and
[1:56:23] sorrow but through all those 20 years
[1:56:26] God was still joined to Jacob yes he was
[1:56:30] like he was joined to the
[1:56:33] wall if this wall moves God said I'm
[1:56:36] moving

[2:07:44] monster yes sir you're going to find

[2:07:49] don't exist the thing that's keeping you
[2:07:51] away from your
[2:07:53] bethl is a
[2:07:55] farce it's not even
[2:08:00] reality the enemy is trying to tell you
[2:08:04] it'll cost you too much no 20 more years
[2:08:08] of
[2:08:09] worming is what's going to cost this
[2:08:11] little bride if she chooses that kind of
[2:08:14] a life if she chooses another lap around
[2:08:16] the
[2:08:17] mountain I'm I'm going to be very real
[2:08:20] and very honest I'm fearful for you come
[2:08:24] on because I don't know if your generals
[2:08:27] have another 20
[2:08:29] years I'm just being real my family gets
[2:08:33] mad they don't like for me to talk that
[2:08:35] way but it's
[2:08:37] reality I I hope that if if for some odd
[2:08:42] strange reason Jesus terries I hope I'm
[2:08:44] the strongest 90y old preacher the world
[2:08:47] has ever
[2:08:48] seen but I'm not promised of that
[2:08:52] and you're not either and I'm fearful
[2:08:54] for this little
[2:08:56] bride because I see her generals getting
[2:08:59] older and
[2:09:02] sicker it's not just one out there
[2:09:04] dealing with cancer but now several cuz
[2:09:07] you got to go if God calls you you're go
[2:09:09] with
[2:09:10] something I I I'm worried I'm worried if
[2:09:13] you can't make it with your Generals in
[2:09:15] the land what will you do
[2:09:23] Jacob remember how I touched you and you
[2:09:26] know where Jacob went in Genesis 33 not
[2:09:29] back to bethl he went to
[2:09:33] sheam one of the worst mistakes of his
[2:09:36] life do I have another
[2:09:38] hour she means two
[2:09:41] things it means going
[2:09:46] back and it means a place of
[2:09:48] burdens so Jacob chose rather to go back
[2:09:53] to a place of
[2:09:55] burdens than to an altar of
[2:09:59] Deliverance we're going to have a book
[2:10:01] of Acts church but we're not going to
[2:10:04] find it running back to our
[2:10:06] burdens we're going to find it running
[2:10:08] back to the
[2:10:11] altar Amen brother Amen brother he had
[2:10:14] to go back and Sheck them he got in all
[2:10:16] kinds of trouble do you remember on his
[2:10:19] house was Dishonored one one of his
[2:10:21] daughters was
[2:10:25] raped he didn't obey the Lord and it
[2:10:27] cost him The
[2:10:29] Virginity of one of his precious little
[2:10:32] girls and his son committed
[2:10:37] murder what horrible burdens Jacob had
[2:10:41] to
[2:10:42] carry because instead of going back to
[2:10:45] bethl he went to
[2:10:48] Sheck he went back to his burdens back
[2:10:51] to his sins back to his
[2:10:55] hardship yet not one time this is the
[2:10:58] most awful thing I know yet not one time
[2:11:01] did he even begin in scripture we don't
[2:11:03] know but in scripture we have no
[2:11:05] indication that he ever reckoned his
[2:11:09] troubles to being out of God's
[2:11:14] will he did like some of you have done
[2:11:16] remember I love
[2:11:19] you remember I love you tell the TRU
[2:11:23] he's done like like some of you have
[2:11:25] done
[2:11:26] on the devil's after
[2:11:31] me I'm under spiritual
[2:11:33] attack no no no no no
[2:11:36] no you're getting what you paid
[2:11:39] [Applause]
[2:11:40] for you're reaping what you
[2:11:43] sowed that ain't the devil trying to
[2:11:45] kill you come
[2:11:48] on that's God trying to kill you on
[2:11:53] cuz he knows the only way you're going
[2:11:54] to serve him is if you have a
[2:11:56] [Music]
[2:11:58] death I'm not talking about a natural
[2:12:00] death for some it means that I can show
[2:12:02] you in the message where brother brandom
[2:12:04] tells
[2:12:06] us about the Parson who fell away from
[2:12:09] the Lord bitterness and hurt with the
[2:12:10] church and so forth fell away from the
[2:12:12] Lord and he wanted all he wanted was
[2:12:17] cigarettes brother brandom said I've
[2:12:20] been guilty a lot of things but I've not
[2:12:22] been guilty of taking cigarettes to The
[2:12:24] Parson you read a little bit into that
[2:12:26] story and you'll find out that brother
[2:12:28] Bram later said and he died God took
[2:12:31] him before he
[2:12:33] totally by the way brother brandom
[2:12:36] indicates to us he he went to
[2:12:41] God now you won't get a revelation of
[2:12:44] that the Pentecostal Church you got to
[2:12:45] be a little bit Baptist to get that
[2:12:49] Revelation you got to know a little bit
[2:12:51] about election and
[2:12:53] predestination to understand how that's
[2:12:55] even possible you don't believe that do
[2:12:57] you brother Shelly with all my heart I
[2:12:59] Can't Hardly Wait was his name Ramsay

[2:13:22] that he ever had for Jesus so even a
[2:13:24] even a physical

[2:17:24] will not a word about all the pollution
[2:17:27] and the murder and the uncleanness no

[2:18:28] Infidel you're reaping what you've

[2:20:12] Obey go back to the altar simply go back
[2:20:16] to your first love are you still with me
[2:20:19] I'm I'm hurrying along
[2:20:21] go back to your first
[2:20:24] love and guess
[2:20:27] what it's struck the
[2:20:30] target 20 plus years later 20 plus years
[2:20:35] later lot of
[2:20:42] Sorrow this is going to be rough for
[2:20:44] some
[2:20:45] streamers but you
[2:20:47] daddies think of this have you ever
[2:20:50] thought about how it would break your
[2:20:52] heart to see one of your little girls
[2:20:54] wearing a pair of blue
[2:20:58] jeans I realize that's not the worst
[2:21:00] thing she could ever
[2:21:02] do I realize that's not the grossest sin
[2:21:05] she could ever
[2:21:08] do but it hangs over me
[2:21:11] sometime the
[2:21:14] thought I think a backslider ought to
[2:21:16] show respect
[2:21:22] I think when you go to Mom and Dad he
[2:21:24] the least you can
[2:21:28] do put on a
[2:21:30] skirt some people condemn her for doing
[2:21:32] it some people condemn her for not doing
[2:21:34] it some people condemn a mom and daddy
[2:21:37] for not letting them come back unless
[2:21:38] they do some people condemn them for
[2:21:41] letting them come back if they don't you
[2:21:43] can't really win with
[2:21:45] people but it it hangs over me sometime
[2:21:48] I don't know I'll be honest with you I
[2:21:50] don't know I have a feeling I wouldn't
[2:21:51] handle it very well I wouldn't handle it
[2:21:54] very well if one of my daughters walked
[2:21:56] in my house one of these days with their
[2:21:58] hair bobbed
[2:22:00] off because they know better just like
[2:22:04] you folk know
[2:22:07] better but the
[2:22:10] thought of your daughter being
[2:22:13] raped because you took her to the wrong
[2:22:16] City
[2:22:21] because you hung out in the wrong
[2:22:24] place the guilt of that I don't know how
[2:22:27] you could get above that hardly I don't
[2:22:29] know how you could rise above that I
[2:22:32] know it's getting tight in
[2:22:36] here but finally yes it struck Jacob yes
[2:22:41] sir I've tried it all I've tried
[2:22:43] everything else I've worn my way
[2:22:45] everywhere else I could go so he just
[2:22:48] decided
[2:22:50] to get rid of all of his
[2:22:52] idols Bible said Bible tells us he he'd
[2:22:55] become an idol
[2:22:58] worshipper gathered up his
[2:23:00] family went back to bethl aren't you
[2:23:03] glad he
[2:23:05] did cuz Jacob wasn't always going to be
[2:23:12] Jacob sir he was going to have a name
[2:23:16] change he could have had it 20 years
[2:23:19] earlier than he did
[2:23:23] did get get up get back to bethl this
[2:23:26] time he responded he gathered up his
[2:23:28] family went back to bethl there he was
[2:23:31] restored and God was joined to him until
[2:23:34] the victory was won we too are being
[2:23:37] called in this hour to lay down our
[2:23:40] Idols to put on new clothes to get back
[2:23:43] to the altar of repentance come on I
[2:23:46] need an amen Jacob's not the only
[2:23:49] example of God's persistent faithfulness
[2:23:51] to his children look at the New
[2:23:52] Testament example of Peter yes sir what
[2:23:56] could possibly be worse than a
[2:23:58] reputation for denying the Lord poor
[2:24:01] stumbling failing cowardly
[2:24:04] Peter out in the boat fishing trying to
[2:24:07] soothe his troubled conscience on the
[2:24:09] shore was the one he had denied Jesus
[2:24:13] didn't come to Peter to condemn
[2:24:16] him he came to give him dinner
[2:24:21] yes sir folks I can't fathom a god like
[2:24:25] this think about it if you think you've
[2:24:28] got God figured out I assure you you do
[2:24:31] not doesn't it seem like Jesus would
[2:24:34] have slapped Peter senseless come on but
[2:24:37] instead he came and cooked him
[2:24:42] fish he made him a little
[2:24:46] meal Peter's out there trying to clear
[2:24:49] his head going back to what he
[2:24:52] knew
[2:24:57] fishing and all of his failure and all
[2:25:00] of his
[2:25:03] denial trying to get his mind cleared
[2:25:05] trying to get out from under the
[2:25:07] condemnation Jesus comes to the shore
[2:25:09] built a little fire cook some fish and
[2:25:12] calls out to
[2:25:15] Peter come and D
[2:25:21] come and
[2:25:22] dine come and
[2:25:24] D come and
[2:25:26] dine Peter comeing nine you see I can't
[2:25:30] tell you how long this will go on before
[2:25:33] you really
[2:25:35] pay all I know is if you belong to God
[2:25:38] he's persistent enough I cannot tell you
[2:25:41] what it'll cost you but one day you'll
[2:25:43] give him
[2:25:47] everything you see there's a lot of
[2:25:49] folks I don't worry about this going to
[2:25:54] hell I worry about how much it's going
[2:25:57] to cost them to get to
[2:26:00] heaven I don't live in fear of my loved
[2:26:03] ones going to
[2:26:04] hell I've got a
[2:26:06] promise I know what the word
[2:26:10] said I don't lose my mind over you going
[2:26:13] to
[2:26:16] hell I know where you're going most of
[2:26:18] you I've got a word I've got a problem
[2:26:20] PR I've got a personal revelation for
[2:26:23] many people in this house but what I do
[2:26:26] worry about is what it's going to cost
[2:26:30] you before you find your way back to
[2:26:37] bethl come and
[2:26:42] d i I love
[2:26:44] Peter I
[2:26:47] do I love everything about Peter
[2:26:52] I love his
[2:26:56] temper I can resemble that I I mean
[2:27:03] I his Humanity the fact that he couldn't
[2:27:06] really
[2:27:08] lie cuz even the chicken towed on
[2:27:12] him I mean there's some of you your
[2:27:14] destiny is so big in
[2:27:16] God you can only get so far and even the
[2:27:19] roost ERS will start telling on
[2:27:23] you come on now some of you had mamas
[2:27:27] like roosters and Daddy's like roosters
[2:27:29] and Grandma's like roosters and you go
[2:27:31] out and pretend to do a certain way and
[2:27:33] and God God just come by and tell Granny
[2:27:36] on you tell mama on you tell Daddy on
[2:27:38] you tell you come on come on come on
[2:27:41] come on and God loved Peter so much and
[2:27:44] and one of the reasons why I like the
[2:27:46] Chosen and I face a little criticism
[2:27:48] because I do but one of the reasons why
[2:27:50] I like the chosen is because of
[2:27:54] Peter he has short people
[2:28:02] syndrome kind of like a little Banny
[2:28:07] rooster got amazing biceps for such a
[2:28:10] little
[2:28:16] shrimp he don't mind to show his knees
[2:28:18] if he has to you know
[2:28:21] he's used to working
[2:28:23] hard fishermen couldn't wear uh robes to
[2:28:26] the ground you know they had work to
[2:28:32] do I like his struggles I like his
[2:28:35] loyalty in the chosen I'm talking I like
[2:28:37] his
[2:28:38] loyalty he don't understand everything
[2:28:42] he don't pretend to understand
[2:28:44] everything but he's always trying to
[2:28:46] help somebody keep the right attitude
[2:28:48] can you imagine with the temper like him
[2:28:51] above sa and yet he wants to make sure
[2:28:53] he's worried about
[2:28:57] Thomas he wants to make sure everybody
[2:28:59] keeps the right
[2:29:01] attitude God's talking to
[2:29:11] somebody Jesus says come and D have you
[2:29:15] failed the
[2:29:16] Lord have you disappointed him have you
[2:29:19] done despite to his grace have you lived
[2:29:21] a life like a slave in the dirt when you
[2:29:23] could have been living in the victory
[2:29:26] are you afraid of God's Wrath are you in
[2:29:28] turmoil because you think God Wants
[2:29:30] Revenge then look at the savior's
[2:29:32] example here come and
[2:29:35] DME I got a fish sandwich for
[2:29:39] you I'd like to choke you with a
[2:29:44] bat you've hurt
[2:29:46] me but I've got a fish sandwich for you
[2:29:51] because your destiny is ever before me
[2:29:53] he's saying I'm joined to you Peter it'd
[2:29:57] be easy in the natural to cut you off
[2:30:00] yes sir but but in the
[2:30:03] spirit I'm join to you can't get away
[2:30:07] from you yes sir believe in you yes sir
[2:30:12] hello the Lord fed Peter he lovingly
[2:30:16] showed him the root of his
[2:30:18] problem it was though Jesus was saying
[2:30:21] to Peter I enjoy fellowship with you did
[2:30:24] you know that if you and I could get
[2:30:26] that Revelation
[2:30:28] today that he doesn't just want you to
[2:30:31] cower he wants to fellowship with
[2:30:35] you he wants to spend time with you he
[2:30:38] doesn't just want your blind obedience
[2:30:40] he wants to fellowship with you he likes
[2:30:43] you he doesn't just love you he likes
[2:30:46] you he wants to have a meal with you
[2:30:55] he leaves the church world to condemn
[2:30:58] you come on he just wants to feed you
[2:31:01] yes
[2:31:04] sir John
[2:31:07] 2115 so when they had
[2:31:11] died Jesus said to Simon
[2:31:14] Peter lovest thou
[2:31:16] me more than these
[2:31:20] this was the acts being laid to the root
[2:31:22] Peter's real problem all along had been
[2:31:26] Pride before he fell Peter had thought
[2:31:28] of himself as someone especially holy
[2:31:30] Pious strong in wisdom and full of
[2:31:33] character remembering his boast remember
[2:31:36] his boast he said though all others fail
[2:31:38] not I he genuinely believed he loved the
[2:31:40] Lord more than any of the other disci do
[2:31:42] you hear me do you hear what I'm saying
[2:31:45] sir Peter really believed that nobody
[2:31:48] loved Jesus like he loved
[2:31:51] him and that's why he had to go to Rock
[2:31:56] Bottom and he didn't deny him before
[2:31:59] Kings and
[2:32:00] potentates he denied him in front of a
[2:32:05] dishwasher he had to see
[2:32:08] himself he considered himself a bit more
[2:32:11] sober more sincere more zealous more
[2:32:14] concerned with the kingdom it's in such
[2:32:17] a circumstance that God allows sin to
[2:32:20] serve his holy purpose hear me he will
[2:32:23] let a Christian's Pride be severely
[2:32:26] tested by overwhelming
[2:32:28] Temptations some of you have fallen
[2:32:30] where you have fallen because Pride was
[2:32:33] your
[2:32:35] problem God opened the door and allowed
[2:32:38] the enemy to tempt you he allowed you to
[2:32:40] fall right in the middle of it he
[2:32:43] allowed you to to slop around in the
[2:32:46] poop
[2:32:50] because you thought you were such a Jew
[2:32:52] so
[2:32:54] holy so holy you Pharisee come on
[2:32:58] brother and you ended up in the pig
[2:33:04] pin the most hated
[2:33:08] thing and here the prodigal props his
[2:33:11] head on a mother
[2:33:16] s the Bible said he would have vain
[2:33:19] filled his belly with the husks that the
[2:33:22] swine did
[2:33:24] eat he was ready to not only eat a pig
[2:33:27] he was ready to eat pig
[2:33:31] food but one day Jacob heard the call go
[2:33:37] back to
[2:33:38] bethl Peter heard the call come and
[2:33:41] dying The Prodigal heard the
[2:33:44] call my father has servants that are
[2:33:47] eating better
[2:33:50] living better than I am I'll just go
[2:33:52] back and apologize I'll just go back and
[2:33:54] tell him how sorry I am and I won't even
[2:33:56] ask to be a son I'm not worthy to be a
[2:33:58] son I've already spent my inheritance
[2:34:01] I've already shamed my father hear
[2:34:03] me I'm nearly
[2:34:05] done I've already shamed my
[2:34:08] father but he said I'll just let ask him
[2:34:11] could I be a slave could I be a
[2:34:14] servant could I be as one of your hired
[2:34:17] servants
[2:34:33] once God got to the root of Jacob's
[2:34:37] problem he was living in an alternate
[2:34:41] reality he thought the devil was
[2:34:44] attacking
[2:34:45] him and he realized I'm paying the price
[2:34:48] for not doing what God called me to do
[2:34:50] Peter had to learn that he was living in
[2:34:52] an alternate reality and it was his
[2:34:54] pride that was costing him everything
[2:34:57] the prodal had to learn that he too was
[2:34:59] consumed with with pride
[2:35:02] sir and he was lustful of the pleasures
[2:35:07] of the world he wasted his inheritance
[2:35:10] on riotous
[2:35:16] living there's something wrong with
[2:35:18] somebody
[2:35:20] that'll spend
[2:35:22] $5,000 for a three-day
[2:35:25] ticket to watch a golf
[2:35:32] game and that's where that's the world
[2:35:35] we're living
[2:35:36] in the whole world has descended this
[2:35:39] weekend on
[2:35:41] Augusta for the Master's tournament and
[2:35:44] they may sell you a Pino and cheese
[2:35:47] sandwich for $150 but you've done paid
[2:35:49] $5 $5,000 or more to be there for the
[2:35:52] weekend my God they ought excuse me that
[2:35:54] wasn't the right way to say it my
[2:35:56] goodness they already give you the
[2:36:00] sandwich and there's a
[2:36:02] lottery in only 20,000 people because
[2:36:05] they've already got people who have
[2:36:07] tickets every
[2:36:08] year there's only 20,000 tickets
[2:36:11] available and there's a
[2:36:14] lottery and there's usually 75 to
[2:36:16] 100,000 people on the list waiting to
[2:36:19] spend
[2:36:21] to watch one of the most boring games in
[2:36:25] the entire world to
[2:36:28] watch Joshua River
[2:36:33] Shelly you may thoroughly enjoy playing
[2:36:37] it but watching someone else it's about
[2:36:40] as exciting as
[2:36:47] tennis at least with football oh they
[2:36:49] keep falling
[2:36:54] down basketball is about as I'm telling
[2:36:57] you it's kind of dull too to me I know
[2:36:59] some of you get real
[2:37:02] excited the only thing that can keep my
[2:37:04] attention for more than 10 or 15 minutes
[2:37:07] is
[2:37:08] baseball and that's only because there's
[2:37:10] so much going on at one
[2:37:13] time and and and and it's not just a
[2:37:16] ball back and forth it could go anywhere
[2:37:19] usually
[2:37:20] up usually over there the most exciting
[2:37:23] part of watching a baseball game is
[2:37:25] watching people catch the ball out in
[2:37:26] the stand and then hold it up as though
[2:37:28] no one saw them catch
[2:37:33] it people spend all that
[2:37:36] money to experience something like that
[2:37:41] never care that you were born with a
[2:37:45] destiny with a higher purpose
[2:37:50] exactly
[2:37:55] right God has a message he wants to
[2:37:57] deliver to peters's and Jacob's and
[2:37:59] prodigal sons and captive Daughters of
[2:38:05] Zion what message does the Lord want to
[2:38:07] deliver not revenge or wrath or judgment
[2:38:10] no he will add no sorrow to that
[2:38:12] brokenhearted howling hurting woman
[2:38:14] lying in the dust rather he chooses to
[2:38:16] comfort her with these words Isaiah 5 27
[2:38:20] I'm closing musicians are coming I'm not
[2:38:22] done but I'll stop let me read Isaiah
[2:38:25] 527 this is what he what he says to the
[2:38:28] Fallen Daughter of Zion this is how he
[2:38:30] Comforts her this is how he wants to
[2:38:32] comfort Jacobs and pull them back to
[2:38:34] their Destiny and prodigal sons back and
[2:38:37] Peter's back and Fallen Captive
[2:38:39] Daughters of Zion how beautiful upon the
[2:38:43] mountains are the feet of him that
[2:38:47] bringeth good tidings that publisheth
[2:38:50] peace that bringeth good tidings of good
[2:38:54] that publisheth salvation that saith UND
[2:39:00] Zion thy God
[2:39:07] reth your beauty is not in your
[2:39:10] pride your beauty is not in your ability
[2:39:12] to buy $5,000 tickets do you think
[2:39:15] you've
[2:39:17] arrived you're ability is not to flash
[2:39:20] your Dollars
[2:39:22] around that that that's not what makes
[2:39:24] you who you
[2:39:26] are the most valuable thing about you is
[2:39:29] the call of God on your life to comfort
[2:39:33] Zion that's right to shout the good
[2:39:37] news you can run yourself ragged in your
[2:39:42] studies and miss the reality of a
[2:39:44] relationship with Jesus Christ if you've
[2:39:47] missed a relationship with him you're a
[2:39:50] religious
[2:39:54] fool you can be a
[2:39:57] fool an educated and religious
[2:40:02] fool if you miss your opportunity to
[2:40:05] have an intimate personal
[2:40:08] relationship with Jesus Christ yes you
[2:40:12] believe that say
[2:40:14] amen I want to read you one more place
[2:40:16] in closing Isaiah
[2:40:18] 5289 thy
[2:40:20] Watchmen shall lift up the
[2:40:23] voice with the voice together shall they
[2:40:26] sing for they shall see eye to eye when
[2:40:29] the Lord shall bring again
[2:40:33] Zion Break Forth into Joy sing together
[2:40:37] ye waste places of Jerusalem for the
[2:40:40] Lord hath comforted his people he hath
[2:40:45] redeemed Jerusalem
[2:40:49] naturally speaking it's not an Iron
[2:40:55] Dome I stood there as a guest of
[2:40:59] APAC and saw the first Iron Dome that
[2:41:03] was
[2:41:04] installed in Jerusalem when when you
[2:41:07] hear Iron Dome you may wonder what it
[2:41:09] looks like I saw it with my own eyes I
[2:41:12] touched touched it with my
[2:41:16] hand I know the reality of it
[2:41:19] it works
[2:41:21] amazing on Kasam
[2:41:23] Rockets which are homemade
[2:41:27] Rockets but it in no way has the ability
[2:41:30] to deal with what Israel dealt with last
[2:41:34] night so there's two more levels of
[2:41:37] security Israel has the the greatest
[2:41:42] technology for weapon
[2:41:44] defense in the
[2:41:47] world and if you if if you are one of
[2:41:50] those uh Loosey Goosey Democrats who
[2:41:53] sees America funneling money to Israel
[2:41:57] as though they're just giving it away no
[2:41:59] that's what we're doing in the
[2:42:03] Ukraine but what we're doing in Israel
[2:42:06] is investing in somebody who has the
[2:42:08] ability to protect our nation right
[2:42:12] because the
[2:42:13] technology for those weapons and missile
[2:42:15] defense uh strategies is now
[2:42:22] ours it now belongs to
[2:42:25] us and we may need
[2:42:27] it before this thing is
[2:42:31] over I've told you before Israel has
[2:42:35] three levels of defense and all three
[2:42:38] actually four but two are are cousins of
[2:42:41] one another top level I don't remember
[2:42:43] the name the second level is is called
[2:42:45] David sling
[2:42:49] you've got Iron Dome David sling does
[2:42:51] anybody remember the name of the of the
[2:42:53] of the two cousins arrows and they got
[2:42:56] numbers after that don't they they're
[2:42:59] cousins they're they're very similar
[2:43:02] systems and for the first time in the
[2:43:04] history of Israel all three of those
[2:43:07] weapon defense missile defense units
[2:43:10] were used last
[2:43:16] night Israel has always had a problem
[2:43:19] problem with
[2:43:22] pride look the
[2:43:24] book read the book that's not an awful
[2:43:26] accusation it's the truth she's always
[2:43:29] had a terrible problem with pride that's
[2:43:31] why God didn't allow her to amass in the
[2:43:35] beginning the weapons and support that
[2:43:37] she has today that's why her most
[2:43:40] successful victories have been dropping
[2:43:43] mov cocktails out of airplane windows
[2:43:50] did you know strategically by the
[2:43:53] Numbers Israel's victory in the Sin when
[2:43:56] the nation was being founded was more
[2:43:59] successful by the Numbers I've been on
[2:44:02] the airplanes that the malov cocktails
[2:44:05] were you know what that is don't you
[2:44:07] gasoline fuel in a in a Cocola bottle
[2:44:10] with a rag hanging out the end that's
[2:44:13] about what it
[2:44:15] is they were taking out not only armies
[2:44:18] but they were taking out
[2:44:21] weapons of hundreds of thousands of
[2:44:23] dollars of
[2:44:24] value with Cocola bottles full of
[2:44:28] fuel why would God do something like
[2:44:30] that why would God show up on the Temple
[2:44:33] Mount just before Moshe Diane gave the
[2:44:36] Temple Mount uh into the authority of
[2:44:40] the of the Jordanian
[2:44:42] walks Moshe Diane you'll know him by his
[2:44:45] one eye
[2:44:46] patch he was a a great Statesman but a
[2:44:49] quite a
[2:44:52] compromiser why would why would God do
[2:44:55] the things that he did on that Temple
[2:44:57] Mount where uh uh Jordanian soldiers
[2:45:00] have
[2:45:02] testified that it wasn't the few little
[2:45:04] Israeli soldiers that scared
[2:45:08] them that's not what caused them to run
[2:45:11] out of their
[2:45:13] sandals it was that army of
[2:45:16] white that showed up on the Temple mount
[2:45:19] I have spoken to the eyewitnesses of the
[2:45:24] event now you can read it in a book and
[2:45:26] say hm but when you're sitting there
[2:45:29] with someone who experienced that
[2:45:32] brother gy and I and brother brother
[2:45:34] West and brother
[2:45:37] Whitaker and you hear them tell the
[2:45:39] story themselves or or his his personal
[2:45:43] test gersan Solomon's personal
[2:45:46] testimony of how God spared him after
[2:45:49] the Jeep ran over
[2:45:52] him it was the army of white that sh
[2:45:55] showed up that gave them the
[2:45:58] victory so let me say this we're
[2:46:01] thankful to God for iron domes and
[2:46:05] David's slings and all the other
[2:46:07] technology that that God has blessed
[2:46:09] Israel with but we really know that it's
[2:46:13] the hand of God's provision and
[2:46:16] Providence over Israel that's bringing
[2:46:18] her
[2:46:19] the survival that she has today and the
[2:46:22] success isn't that amazing and God he
[2:46:25] just humbled her and he will again if
[2:46:29] she won't serve him
[2:46:35] right the the the event that started all
[2:46:39] of
[2:46:40] this was was what we would call a
[2:46:43] rave in this nation a
[2:46:46] wild worldly
[2:46:50] party where people were half-dressed
[2:46:54] banging their heads on one
[2:46:57] another celebrating peace between Jews
[2:47:01] and
[2:47:02] Arabs it wasn't a holy ghost tent
[2:47:06] meeting it was a horrible awful hideous
[2:47:12] unprovoked
[2:47:14] Massacre but God speaks in all things
[2:47:22] I don't know if you've seen the pictures
[2:47:24] of how Israel ran out of her
[2:47:26] shoes on October the
[2:47:30] 7th not because of an Angel Army but
[2:47:34] because an of an invasion from
[2:47:37] hate-filled
[2:47:39] people and their shoes
[2:47:42] remain people are going and visiting the
[2:47:45] site the bloody clothes are are are are
[2:47:49] left for people to
[2:47:53] see the enemy is to
[2:47:58] blame but God's always talking to his
[2:48:02] people without me you're
[2:48:05] nothing you're not even keeping the
[2:48:08] Commandments that I've given you much
[2:48:11] less turning toward a coming Messiah but
[2:48:14] she
[2:48:16] will the Bible tells us all
[2:48:20] Israel will be
[2:48:22] saved Only a God like ours could pull
[2:48:25] that off let's stand
