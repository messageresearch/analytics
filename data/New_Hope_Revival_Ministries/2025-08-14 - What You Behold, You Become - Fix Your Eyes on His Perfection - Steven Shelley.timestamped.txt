[0:00] And you know, we become
[0:03] like what we
[0:05] focus on.
[0:07] &gt;&gt; That's New Testament. Paul said it.
[0:10] &gt;&gt; The more we gaze on uh our unworthiness,
[0:15] &gt;&gt; the more we produce unworthy behavior,
[0:18] we keep getting tripped up in the same
[0:20] old stuff because our uh shortcoming is
[0:24] what we focus on. But when we start
[0:26] focusing on his perfection, his beauty,
[0:31] his he has elected us. He has called us.
[0:35] The reality is we wouldn't have perhaps
[0:38] chosen ourselves. But we didn't have to.
[0:40] I wish somebody would help me.
[0:43] &gt;&gt; We didn't have to choose ourselves
[0:45] because he chose us.
[0:47] &gt;&gt; And if you don't believe it, you just go
[0:49] to the book. The book said, "You have
[0:51] not chosen me."
[0:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:56] But I have chosen you, says the Lord.
[1:00] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm telling you, if he chooses you,
[1:03] it's because he knows that you have a
[1:05] heart to serve him. It's because he
[1:08] knows that when you say yes, it will be
[1:10] an eternal yes. If he chose you, it's
[1:14] because he saw your end. Amen.
[1:17] &gt;&gt; He saw your end and he knew that you in
[1:21] the end was worth
[1:25] &gt;&gt; whatever it took
[1:27] &gt;&gt; to get you to that end.
[1:30] &gt;&gt; You, my friend, as a born again believer
[1:33] of an end time truth, you have a fixed
[1:36] end.
[1:37] &gt;&gt; Your end is determined.
[1:40] You can play around sometime with your
[1:42] present because too many believers
[1:45] oscillate between the perfect will of
[1:48] God and the permissive will of God. It's
[1:51] a very serious hour that we're living in
[1:53] right now. It may not be your priority,
[1:55] but it's his priority for us
[1:59] &gt;&gt; that we catch a glimpse and an
[2:01] understanding of this place that the
[2:04] bride must walk in, live in, minister
[2:08] in, worship in before we leave here in
[2:12] rapture. Do you believe in rapture? I
[2:15] do.
[2:16] &gt;&gt; Have you had one this week? I have.
[2:19] Hallelujah.
[2:20] &gt;&gt; But there will be there will be a
[2:22] culmination.
[2:24] &gt;&gt; There will be an hour where all the dead
[2:26] in Christ
[2:28] &gt;&gt; in Christ shall rise first. They which
[2:31] are alive and remain will be caught up.
[2:33] There is an event that will culminate
[2:37] and bring to climax the rapture. But as
[2:41] I told you last week, rapture is being
[2:43] caught up out of your mundane.
[2:49] grit and grind,
[2:51] pedal to the metal Monday,
[2:54] &gt;&gt; and and coming up into a higher place of
[2:58] devotion, consecration, and worship.
[3:02] &gt;&gt; And it's in that place that we find the
[3:04] tabernacle, the pavilion, we also find
[3:07] the rest.
[3:08] &gt;&gt; How many of you like the idea of rest?
[3:12] Well, there is a rest promised to the
[3:15] people of God.
[3:16] &gt;&gt; And it's a spiritual rest, but it
[3:19] refreshes even the natural part of who
[3:21] we are.
[3:22] &gt;&gt; That's what the tabernacle of David
[3:24] represents. That's what the rest that
[3:26] the children of Israel could not find.
[3:29] &gt;&gt; They heard the word. They heard
[3:31] everything necessary to find that place.
[3:34] But it benefited them nothing. Is that
[3:36] what he said? Very little. Because they
[3:38] didn't mix it with faith. They didn't
[3:40] say that's me. So when somebody
[3:43] rediscovers what God has promised to be
[3:48] doing for us in the end time, then you
[3:51] have an opportunity to find something in
[3:54] that that calls to your destiny. And
[3:57] when you hear that call to your destiny
[4:00] and your inner man begins to quiver and
[4:03] vibrate because of a truth that you have
[4:06] heard, then you allow faith to come
[4:08] rushing in. And faith takes a bulldog
[4:12] grip
[4:14] &gt;&gt; on the promise and it says, "I don't
[4:17] care if anybody else takes a hold of
[4:19] this or not. I'm going to take a hold of
[4:23] this and it's not just going to be a
[4:25] memory.
[4:28] For me, it will be a reality
[4:31] &gt;&gt; because I'll spend enough time in the
[4:34] tent.
[4:35] &gt;&gt; I'll spend enough time in the pavilion.
[4:38] I'll spend enough time in the sanctuary.
[4:40] I'll spend enough time in the shecka.
[4:44] &gt;&gt; I'll spend enough time in the glory.
[4:49] &gt;&gt; I'll get under the inspiration
[4:52] of the fullness of the seventh seal.
