[43:22] place but I ask you for Grace where we
[43:26] can surrender
[43:28] and you can come

[1:20:15] don't worry
[1:20:17] I'll see you on the other side I feel
[1:20:20] the same toward you we don't ever know
[1:20:23] when we've hugged our one another's neck
[1:20:25] for the last time I don't want to get
[1:20:27] morbid
[1:20:28] I just want to be honest we don't ever
[1:20:31] know
[1:20:32] when we say goodbye I'll see you later
[1:20:34] see you after a while
[1:20:36] crocodile or whatever you say we don't
[1:20:39] ever know whether it be on this side or
[1:20:40] the other side but if you'll do like
[1:20:42] brother Greeley said this morning and
[1:20:44] you'll live with no dead cats on the
[1:20:46] line
[1:20:47] let me tell you something my grandmother
[1:20:49] always gave this testimony when my aunt
[1:20:52] was just a little bitty girl not even a
[1:20:54] teenager and she fell dead at her feet
[1:20:56] with the rheumatic fever her heart
[1:20:58] stopped that's one of the things that
[1:21:01] rheumatic fever did it would stop the
[1:21:03] heart and she fell dead at my
[1:21:05] grandmother's feet my grandmother said I
[1:21:09] started to think of things I ought to I
[1:21:11] might ought to pray about but but she
[1:21:13] said honestly I had I had prayed I had
[1:21:16] cleared it all up with the Lord and so
[1:21:18] she said all I knew to say was I'll go
[1:21:20] where you want me to go I'll do what you
[1:21:22] want me to do I'll say what you want me
[1:21:24] to say I'll be what you want me to be if
[1:21:26] you won't take my baby girl
[1:21:29] and God gave her back
[1:21:31] to my grandmother
[1:21:33] I said granny was there not anything you
[1:21:36] needed to make right she said if there
[1:21:37] was it didn't come to my mind she said
[1:21:40] because I didn't wait till I got in
[1:21:41] trouble
[1:21:44] to pray about it
[1:21:45] so let us give you that advice again
[1:21:47] don't wait until it's too late or until
[1:21:50] you need to call on him for Mercy or
[1:21:52] help Josiah could have left here he
[1:21:55] certainly could have he had an accident
[1:21:57] this week and he he's let you know that
[1:21:59] already and the and we've prayed for him
[1:22:02] and he's doing good looking pretty good
[1:22:04] and uh that could have easily been
[1:22:07] another way
[1:22:08] sure could have
[1:22:10] wouldn't that have been a sad day for us
[1:22:12] today if he would have left us
[1:22:14] but you know the Lord had a different
[1:22:16] plan
[1:22:17] and even the enemy couldn't take him
[1:22:19] until God got ready to call him so you
[1:22:21] know we've got Blessed assurance
[1:22:24] Blessed Assurance this morning once you
[1:22:26] dedicate your life to the Lord he'll
[1:22:28] take care of the rest of it if you'll
[1:22:30] just say yes sir
[1:22:32] I know there's a lot of preaching out
[1:22:34] there about the devil killing people and
[1:22:36] and the government killing people in the
[1:22:38] hospital killing people and I hear
[1:22:40] people say all kinds of things well all
[1:22:42] you have to do is know you're born again
[1:22:44] of the spirit
[1:22:45] filled with the Holy Ghost Sanctified
[1:22:47] holy and holy Sanctified baptized in the
[1:22:50] name of the Lord Jesus Christ there's no
[1:22:53] other baptism
[1:22:55] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:22:57] Christ and then it doesn't matter what
[1:22:58] comes your way
[1:23:00] God will let you be the only Survivor on
[1:23:02] the Jet Plane if he's not through with
[1:23:03] you

[1:23:07] of there

[1:28:15] wonder if that'll last
[1:28:19] somebody said to me one time hmm
[1:28:23] I wonder if that'll last
[1:28:25] and I said I have a feeling
[1:28:28] that when you've given up this is what I
[1:28:31] said when you've given up they'll still
[1:28:34] be holding on I Didn't Know I Was

[1:29:04] stand
[1:29:05] I appreciate you honoring God's word
[1:29:07] we're going to read the word and then
[1:29:08] let you sit down again
[1:29:11] and uh
[1:29:18] we know that God is going to do great
[1:29:20] things for you over the course of the
[1:29:22] next few weeks
[1:29:23] we know that God is going to mightily
[1:29:26] use brother Greeley
[1:29:28] to minister to you over the next two
[1:29:30] Sundays
[1:29:32] we know that God's going to speak and we
[1:29:35] know that you're going to be blessed and
[1:29:37] helped and when I join you again on the
[1:29:40] first two weekends of March
[1:29:43] I know that would be uh I believe March
[1:29:46] the 5th and the 12th I know that you're
[1:29:49] going to be stronger
[1:29:50] with more Victory with more joy stronger
[1:29:55] in the word than you are this morning
[1:29:58] I completely impeccably 100 percent
[1:30:02] without reservation
[1:30:05] endorse and Trust brother Greeley's
[1:30:08] Ministry
[1:30:09] and you are going to be blessed we have
[1:30:12] years of track record together
[1:30:15] someone said if you all ever disagreed
[1:30:18] we have
[1:30:19] but when you are brothers
[1:30:22] you disagree in the backyard
[1:30:27] and you come to the front yard and
[1:30:29] embrace one another and God has helped
[1:30:32] us to do that all through the years he
[1:30:36] is that kind of a man you're sitting in
[1:30:37] a building response so he is responsible
[1:30:40] for helping it be here God used him to
[1:30:43] put this together we are blessed and
[1:30:46] have been blessed for many years I read
[1:30:49] this week that a sabbatical a true
[1:30:51] sabbatical can last anywhere from three
[1:30:54] months to a year
[1:30:59] and so I am just feeling very good about
[1:31:02] my few weeks away
[1:31:05] I don't think I quite need it but you
[1:31:07] never know what might happen but my I'm
[1:31:10] just kidding oh I'm just kidding Psalms
[1:31:13] 139
[1:31:15] let's go there together also let me
[1:31:18] mention that we will have a fellowship
[1:31:19] weekend here Saturday night April the
[1:31:22] 1st at six o'clock Sunday morning April
[1:31:26] the 2nd at 11 o'clock that will be our
[1:31:28] next Fellowship weekend and hopefully
[1:31:31] the weather will be nice and we can have
[1:31:34] at least under the small tents or
[1:31:36] whatever we can get arranged maybe we
[1:31:39] can have a picnic together that Sunday
[1:31:40] some of our out of town streamers
[1:31:43] perhaps can come and be with us again
[1:31:44] and let's see what the Lord will do amen
[1:31:47] we've still got some time to be together
[1:31:50] between now and then Psalm 139 verse 16
[1:31:53] thine eyes
[1:31:55] did see my substance
[1:31:59] yet being unperfect
[1:32:03] and in thy book
[1:32:06] all my members were written
[1:32:11] which in continuance
[1:32:14] were fashioned
[1:32:16] when as yet there was none of them
[1:32:24] how precious also are thy thoughts unto
[1:32:29] me o God
[1:32:31] How great is the sum of them
[1:32:37] if I should count them think about this
[1:32:40] if I should count them they are more in
[1:32:44] number than the sand
[1:32:47] what is he talking about the Lord's
[1:32:50] thoughts
[1:32:51] toward us
[1:32:53] if I should count them they are more in
[1:32:56] number than the sand when I awake I am
[1:33:01] still with
[1:33:04] thee now while you're standing let me
[1:33:08] read 16 through 18 in the complete
[1:33:11] Jewish Bible
[1:33:13] translated by Dr David Stern
[1:33:16] your eyes could see me as an embryo
[1:33:22] but in your book
[1:33:26] all my days were already written
[1:33:33] my days had been shaped before any of
[1:33:37] them existed
[1:33:40] God how I prize your thoughts how many
[1:33:45] of them there are if I count them there
[1:33:50] are more than grains of sand if I finish
[1:33:54] the count
[1:33:56] I am still with you does that bring
[1:34:01] encouragement to anybody's heart like it
[1:34:04] does mine he is constantly thinking
[1:34:07] about his children his people his sons
[1:34:12] let's bow our heads for just a moment
[1:34:14] father
[1:34:15] we thank you today
[1:34:18] for this Gathering Together
[1:34:21] your wonderful presence that has been in
[1:34:25] our midst
[1:34:27] we thank you for every song of worship
[1:34:30] for every praise for every demonstration
[1:34:33] of the moving of your spirit
[1:34:37] I want to thank you again in the
[1:34:40] presence of this people for letting us
[1:34:43] be gathered together not only in spirit
[1:34:46] but in spirit and in truth
[1:34:50] there could be no monetary value affixed
[1:34:54] to the great privilege you have given us
[1:34:58] to meet together not only in spirit
[1:35:02] but in truth
[1:35:04] Lord truth is not a Doctrine it's not a
[1:35:08] sermon it's not even a message but truth
[1:35:12] is a person
[1:35:13] you are the truth Jesus you are the way
[1:35:19] you are the life
[1:35:21] and so I thank you today that you are
[1:35:25] letting us Gather in spirit and in truth
[1:35:29] and now as we approach your word Open
[1:35:32] the Eyes of our understanding
[1:35:37] anoint them with I salve that we might
[1:35:41] see the purity of the truth of your word
[1:35:45] transform us
[1:35:47] from our Vain and vile image into your
[1:35:52] own image
[1:35:54] so that your own life and Light May
[1:35:58] shine out of us in the darkest hour the
[1:36:01] world is seemingly ever known
[1:36:03] come to us today Lord and help us in our
[1:36:08] time in your word and we will give you
[1:36:11] praise and honor and glory for it's in
[1:36:14] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[1:36:16] pray amen
[1:36:19] and the Saints said
[1:36:21] you may be seated
[1:36:23] I want to spend our time together in the
[1:36:27] word today looking at the subject
[1:36:30] discovering our story
[1:36:35] if I would give it a subtitle I would
[1:36:38] call it discovering our destiny
[1:36:42] but when we talk about history
[1:36:45] we sometimes say history is his story
[1:36:52] his story when we look at God's word
[1:36:55] when we perceive where God has been what
[1:37:00] God has done
[1:37:01] when we Mark the anniversaries in our
[1:37:05] life of times that we have met with God
[1:37:10] we discover where his story and our
[1:37:14] story intertwined aren't you glad aren't
[1:37:18] you glad that your life and his life are
[1:37:21] connected at various points along the
[1:37:24] way and even when we don't perceive that
[1:37:27] we are indeed connected with him when we
[1:37:31] surrender Our Lives to him we quit
[1:37:34] living our life stay with me we quit
[1:37:37] living our life and we start living his
[1:37:40] life the apostles said the life that I
[1:37:43] now live is not my own I'm living the
[1:37:46] Christ life I'm living the exchanged
[1:37:50] life I've laid my life down as brother
[1:37:53] Hawk prayed today I've laid my life down
[1:37:57] and I've picked up another life Another
[1:38:00] Life Source if you will I have
[1:38:03] surrendered my will and I have taken up
[1:38:06] the cause of his will if you're living
[1:38:10] after your own will you haven't reached
[1:38:13] the end of the Hard Knocks if you're
[1:38:16] living after your own desire and not
[1:38:19] inquiring of the Lord concerning his
[1:38:22] desire for your life your troubles
[1:38:24] aren't nearly over in fact I submit to
[1:38:27] you that they may be complicated as you
[1:38:30] go along it's only when you allow the
[1:38:33] Lord's life to to be the reason for your
[1:38:35] living you can't live for your wife you
[1:38:38] can't live for your husband you can't
[1:38:41] live for your children you can't live
[1:38:43] for your job you can't live for your
[1:38:46] hobby for your home for a newer
[1:38:49] automobile you can only you can't live
[1:38:52] to make another dollar the only reason
[1:38:54] why a true Son of God can live is to
[1:38:58] please the Lord and in doing so He
[1:39:01] blesses us
[1:39:03] with healing for our body with strength
[1:39:07] for the journey with favor and blessing
[1:39:10] as sister Flo testified when she was
[1:39:13] singing and when we refuse to accept the
[1:39:16] Lord's will and we continue to struggle
[1:39:19] for our own way we're going to find our
[1:39:22] life harder than it really has to be I'm
[1:39:25] going to ask you this morning in all
[1:39:27] honesty is there someone here that would
[1:39:30] say I know I've made my way hard by
[1:39:33] fighting for my own will anybody I'm not
[1:39:36] looking too much but I think most of us
[1:39:38] could say yeah there are times that I
[1:39:42] made a harder path for myself because I
[1:39:45] was so hard-headed
[1:39:47] just a minute come on preacher
[1:39:49] talk to us I was so hard-handed so
[1:39:53] stubborn willed
[1:39:56] so set in my mind set in my ways that I
[1:40:00] could not accept anything but how I
[1:40:03] wanted to see it done or how I wanted to
[1:40:05] see it happen
[1:40:07] you know sometimes it's because we get
[1:40:09] tired of waiting on the Lord he doesn't
[1:40:11] move as fast as we want him to move
[1:40:13] sometime but it's like we talked about
[1:40:16] last Sunday he may not come when you
[1:40:18] want him
[1:40:20] but he's right on time
[1:40:22] he never misses an appointment with his
[1:40:25] children
[1:40:26] he never never leaves us too long to
[1:40:28] feel like we're alone if you call on
[1:40:31] Jesus sister Megan was singing This
[1:40:34] Morning When I Call On Jesus doesn't
[1:40:37] matter how dark it is how Bleak it is
[1:40:39] how hopeless it is how ugly it is When I
[1:40:43] Call On Jesus hope returns When I Call
[1:40:47] On Jesus strength comes back to my life
[1:40:49] When I Call On Jesus I feel more
[1:40:53] resilience
[1:40:54] more determination
[1:40:57] encouraged to stand
[1:41:00] the word encourage means to have our
[1:41:02] courage renewed how many of you have
[1:41:05] ever felt the Lord renew your courage
[1:41:08] he just comes to us he strengthens us by
[1:41:13] his presence he doesn't even have to
[1:41:15] talk to us to strengthen us Lord just
[1:41:17] let me get where you are
[1:41:19] just let me come into the atmosphere of
[1:41:22] your glory like we've been in this
[1:41:24] morning you ready to help me preach get
[1:41:27] in that Glory presence and see what God
[1:41:30] will do he'll change a heart he'll
[1:41:33] change your mind he'll change a stubborn
[1:41:35] will
[1:41:38] my old great aunt used to sing a song
[1:41:40] about God changing my stubborn will
[1:41:46] you opened up my eyes
[1:41:48] change my stubborn will
[1:41:51] then it said I I can't be still
[1:41:55] oh here's how it went it said I can't be
[1:41:58] still my heart would chill since I have
[1:42:02] found the Blessed Lord and he changed my
[1:42:04] stubborn will
[1:42:06] how many of you have ever had a change
[1:42:08] of your stubborn will
[1:42:11] in in a book
[1:42:12] s of Destiny I believe it is
[1:42:15] I have a quotation here that I would
[1:42:18] like to read to you because I find it to
[1:42:20] be beautiful
[1:42:21] you said many biblical Scholars have
[1:42:25] difficulty with this
[1:42:27] but I believe in Eve is precisely what
[1:42:30] it says
[1:42:31] I kind of like theologians that will
[1:42:33] leave the Bible at the Bible don't you
[1:42:36] he said our God is Sovereign and
[1:42:38] infinite
[1:42:39] he is not bound by the limitations of
[1:42:42] time
[1:42:43] he can foresee every thought every
[1:42:47] decision and every action that shall
[1:42:51] ever be made
[1:42:52] I want to read it again
[1:43:03] have fought
[1:43:07] he knows what you're thinking
[1:43:10] and he knows what you're going to think
[1:43:12] that's a big God
[1:43:14] you talk about a mind reader that's a
[1:43:16] big God one that not only knows what I
[1:43:19] thought or what I'm thinking now but he
[1:43:21] knows the next thought
[1:43:24] that I'm I'm about to have he knows what
[1:43:27] I'm going to be thinking when I get up
[1:43:28] in the morning
[1:43:30] he knows who knows one to be thinking I
[1:43:32] go to bed tomorrow night
[1:43:34] he has the ability to foresee to know
[1:43:38] and to discern all of my thoughts from
[1:43:41] that Eternal posture he is able to
[1:43:44] record in the journals of Heaven all the
[1:43:48] days of our individual lives
[1:43:53] and he can and has done this before we
[1:43:57] were ever formed in our mother's womb
[1:44:04] I want to know who believes that
[1:44:07] I mean I want to know who believes that
[1:44:09] in here
[1:44:12] this morning and you chose what what
[1:44:13] shirt to put on
[1:44:15] you did it by a thought
[1:44:19] and you sisters chose what dress to put
[1:44:22] on or what shirt blouse to put on what
[1:44:25] shoes to go with your outfit
[1:44:27] you did it by a thought
[1:44:30] if that's true and if the Lord knows
[1:44:33] every thought and before new and pre-new
[1:44:37] every thought it means that he recorded
[1:44:40] your outfit
[1:44:44] wow
[1:44:45] Lord have mercy
[1:44:49] this could be revolutionary for some of
[1:44:51] you sisters
[1:44:54] now my wife I'm going to talk about her
[1:44:57] today because I'm fixing a carrier off
[1:44:59] and wine and diner for it not real wine
[1:45:01] you know that
[1:45:04] I'm gonna give her a grape soda or
[1:45:06] something
[1:45:07] and take her off for a little holiday
[1:45:09] here well deserved holiday so I'm gonna
[1:45:12] have to preach about her just a little
[1:45:13] bit so if you feel it getting tight in
[1:45:16] here you'll know what it's all about
[1:45:19] when I leave on Sunday morning my wife
[1:45:22] has owned an outfit a lot of the time
[1:45:24] not today honey not today well there's a
[1:45:27] new day of dawning
[1:45:29] she said not today when I leave my
[1:45:32] wife's already got her outfit on it's
[1:45:34] very rare for me to see her at church in
[1:45:37] the same outfit
[1:45:41] when I go home on Sunday I know she's
[1:45:44] the only one in here honey you don't
[1:45:46] have to worry
[1:45:47] I can preach the sister beverages I
[1:45:49] understand sister Beth said I sure can
[1:45:52] too
[1:45:53] when I come home on Sunday afternoon
[1:45:55] sometime there is a pile
[1:45:59] on her side of the bed I don't even ask
[1:46:04] on occasion I'll go through the house
[1:46:06] and I'll say honey you had a hard time
[1:46:08] with your outfit today didn't you she
[1:46:10] said I sure did
[1:46:12] but I'll pick up every one of them and
[1:46:14] I'll hang every one of them back up
[1:46:17] so I don't ask anymore if if we could
[1:46:20] just discover that God already knows
[1:46:22] what the last one is going to be
[1:46:25] if we had some way of tapping into that
[1:46:28] thought and just starting out with what
[1:46:30] the Lord wants in everything
[1:46:33] I'm not trying to be silly I'm trying to
[1:46:36] use that as an example how how much more
[1:46:40] stress-free
[1:46:44] could our life be if we recognize that
[1:46:48] God has a plan and a thought about
[1:46:50] everything that pertains to you
[1:46:55] he already knows what you're going to
[1:46:57] decide for dinner
[1:46:59] let me read it because some of you are
[1:47:01] looking at me a little bit odd
[1:47:04] let me read it in the complete Jewish
[1:47:05] Bible again
[1:47:07] your eyes could see me as an embryo
[1:47:10] unformed substance King James says but
[1:47:13] in your book
[1:47:16] of days
[1:47:17] [Music]
[1:47:22] well don't I have a choice
[1:47:24] did God not give me a choice he gave you
[1:47:27] lots of choices he just knows what your
[1:47:30] choice is going to be
[1:47:32] because he's a god of foreknowledge he
[1:47:36] already knows what you're going to
[1:47:37] choose
[1:47:39] and he's already written it down
[1:47:42] you're here today because before the
[1:47:46] foundation of the world the lord saw
[1:47:49] that it's someplace in your life you
[1:47:52] were going to choose to serve him
[1:47:56] he not only knew where you were going to
[1:47:58] choose he knew where you were going to
[1:48:00] end up
[1:48:01] how many of you have attended regularly
[1:48:04] more than five churches in your
[1:48:06] Christian journey I haven't but I know
[1:48:08] many have you have Faithfully attended
[1:48:11] more than five churches for periods of
[1:48:14] time along the way let me see your hand
[1:48:16] that's that's quite a few of us I can't
[1:48:19] say that about myself but I know that's
[1:48:21] many of your story did you know God knew
[1:48:24] every one of them
[1:48:25] he knew that in every place you were
[1:48:27] going to be a sign you were going to
[1:48:29] pick up some truth
[1:48:31] help me now
[1:48:33] you were going to pick up some things
[1:48:34] that were going to strengthen you and
[1:48:36] help you and bless you and teach you
[1:48:41] but he also knew just like you when you
[1:48:43] let me ask you this
[1:48:45] when you when you have you ever been in
[1:48:48] a church
[1:48:49] and once you got there you just knew in
[1:48:51] your nowhere
[1:48:52] this is it
[1:48:54] let me see your hand
[1:48:56] all right now many of you say you know
[1:48:58] that
[1:48:59] let me ask you this did any of you ever
[1:49:01] find out later
[1:49:04] that it wasn't the case
[1:49:07] let me see your hand I thought I had
[1:49:09] found my one and only last
[1:49:12] Church on the Earth
[1:49:14] but I realize that's not the case let me
[1:49:16] see Anne come on I need some audience
[1:49:17] participation this morning
[1:49:19] well how come you felt like that was the
[1:49:21] last one
[1:49:23] because at the time it was meeting all
[1:49:26] of your needs
[1:49:28] and you couldn't ever see a transition
[1:49:31] that would cause you to be uprooted from
[1:49:35] where you had found such broad places to
[1:49:38] live in
[1:49:40] but God already knew then that wasn't
[1:49:42] your last place
[1:49:44] he knows that some of you today may not
[1:49:46] have found your last place I don't know
[1:49:49] that but he knows that and every one of
[1:49:52] those places he had somebody there at
[1:49:55] the right time to give you something you
[1:49:57] needed to help you get on the way
[1:49:59] and my advice to you is don't bash where
[1:50:02] you come from thank God for where you
[1:50:05] come from you wouldn't be
[1:50:07] wouldn't be had you not been through
[1:50:09] some stuff
[1:50:10] amen but praise God that you don't have
[1:50:13] to be in that anymore
[1:50:14] Lord thank you that the pillar of fire
[1:50:16] keeps moving along Lord thank you that
[1:50:20] Holy Ghost leadership doesn't die
[1:50:23] he continues to lead us he continues to
[1:50:27] draw us to closer places in him because
[1:50:31] he knows every one of our days
[1:50:34] oh my God
[1:50:35] he knows all of our children before
[1:50:37] they're born
[1:50:38] come on
[1:50:40] he knows the ones that we will not be
[1:50:43] able to nourish
[1:50:45] till their till the end of their life
[1:50:48] we know in our minds that it is never
[1:50:50] right it never feels right for a mother
[1:50:54] or a dad to have to bury a child and yet
[1:50:57] there are people in this room who have
[1:50:59] had to bury children along the way I'm
[1:51:02] sure there have been times that they
[1:51:04] have asked themselves the question why
[1:51:07] why am I still here why am I 80
[1:51:09] something years old still on the planet
[1:51:12] and and my daughter for instance sister
[1:51:14] flow my daughter taken at such a young
[1:51:17] age we may have these questions but let
[1:51:19] me tell you something one day one day
[1:51:23] you're going to know every reason why I
[1:51:27] doubt you'll ever have to ask him
[1:51:30] I know there's beautiful songs written
[1:51:32] about talking it over with him and
[1:51:34] asking him the reasons and he'll tell us
[1:51:37] the why but I doubt you'll ever have to
[1:51:39] ask him I have a feeling that when we
[1:51:41] get to Eternity with him we'll know even
[1:51:43] as we are known every secret every
[1:51:46] mystery every question everything that
[1:51:49] we desire to understand on Earth but
[1:51:51] just couldn't somehow get our minds
[1:51:52] around it I have to have this Faith to
[1:51:55] believe that we will know
[1:51:57] and it'll give us so much confidence
[1:51:59] and so much peace throughout all
[1:52:02] eternity oh isn't that a wonderful thing
[1:52:04] it's a wonderful thing to know that
[1:52:06] God's got it all under control do you
[1:52:09] ever find a job and you thought it'd be
[1:52:11] your last job you'd never be looking for
[1:52:13] another job next thing you know your job
[1:52:15] hunting
[1:52:16] God saw that transition
[1:52:19] he saw that change do you ever have a
[1:52:21] relationship with somebody a boyfriend
[1:52:23] girlfriend I hate to say husband or wife
[1:52:25] but it's true for some of us
[1:52:28] and you thought this is it this will
[1:52:30] last forever
[1:52:32] and things didn't turn out
[1:52:37] you see God's not just writing his will
[1:52:39] down
[1:52:41] he's writing everything he knows about
[1:52:42] us
[1:52:44] understand he's writing everything he
[1:52:47] knows it's foreknowledge
[1:52:49] it's not forced service
[1:52:52] we understand without spending much time
[1:52:55] in it today that God has a perfect will
[1:52:58] and he has a permissive will it's
[1:53:01] outlined for us both in the Bible and in
[1:53:03] the message we also know there's a book
[1:53:06] of life where every deed of every man
[1:53:08] who ever lived on the planet has at
[1:53:10] least at one time been recorded and then
[1:53:13] there is a Lamb's Book of Life
[1:53:15] brother Branham talks about a transfer
[1:53:18] taking place from one book to another
[1:53:20] but when we search the scripture we
[1:53:23] understand that every name that was ever
[1:53:26] going to be written in that Lamb's Book
[1:53:28] of Life was recorded there before the
[1:53:32] foundation of the world these are they
[1:53:34] whose names were found written in the
[1:53:37] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:53:39] foundation of the world we understand
[1:53:40] from the scripture and the message that
[1:53:43] once your name is in the Lamb's Book of
[1:53:45] Life it can never be blotted out
[1:53:48] the only book that your name can come
[1:53:51] out of is The Book of Life and if your
[1:53:54] name comes out of the Book of Life the
[1:53:56] Bible tells us it is as though you never
[1:53:58] existed on the earth and it is indeed a
[1:54:01] great punishment for those who reject
[1:54:03] and refuse the salvation and the grace
[1:54:06] that the Lord has offered to them in
[1:54:08] this life it's a sad thing to think
[1:54:10] about
[1:54:11] you don't have any time to focus on
[1:54:15] fulfilling somebody else's dreams
[1:54:19] somebody said my mama always dreamed to
[1:54:22] do such and such and such and she's not
[1:54:25] here anymore and I'm going to pick up
[1:54:27] her dreams and I'm gonna go fulfill her
[1:54:29] dream I wouldn't get on that road if I
[1:54:31] were you
[1:54:33] that's not a gerbil will I would find
[1:54:35] myself on if I were you you
[1:54:44] 've done and doing what he has we don't
[1:54:47] have time to pick up somebody else's
[1:54:49] dream or burden or Vision or thought we
[1:54:53] better just pick up and find out what
[1:54:55] the Lord has already written about us
[1:54:58] in his book of our days every one of
[1:55:01] them my days have been shaped before any
[1:55:03] of them existed
[1:55:06] God how I prize your thoughts how many
[1:55:09] of them there are if I count them there
[1:55:12] are more than grains of sand if I finish
[1:55:15] the count I am still with you I want you
[1:55:18] to know we think about God's promise to
[1:55:20] Abraham I'm going to make your seed as
[1:55:24] numerous as the Sands of the seashore we
[1:55:27] think that is a number that could not
[1:55:29] hardly be calculated how many sands how
[1:55:33] many grains of sand are on the seashores
[1:55:36] of the world it seems to me like a a
[1:55:40] number that cannot be calculated
[1:55:43] and yet God says through the psalmist
[1:55:45] here it confirms it by the spirit that
[1:55:49] his thoughts toward you are as numerous
[1:55:52] as the Sands of the sea
[1:55:55] tens of thousands of millions of
[1:55:57] billions of trillions of thoughts
[1:55:59] he's had about you how could it be
[1:56:02] how could it be that in your short years
[1:56:04] here on life that God could have thought
[1:56:07] billions of thoughts about you that's
[1:56:09] how much he loves you
[1:56:11] somebody said I don't believe that then
[1:56:12] you're rejecting what the word said all
[1:56:15] my days
[1:56:16] all my all your thoughts toward me
[1:56:18] they're innumerable they if I should get
[1:56:22] to the ends of the grains of sand I
[1:56:24] should never still finish all the things
[1:56:27] that you have thought about me that you
[1:56:28] have known about me you knew every
[1:56:31] decision before I ever made it
[1:56:33] you knew the consequences of every
[1:56:35] decision you knew the years that I would
[1:56:38] sometimes waste spinning my wheels
[1:56:41] because I had made a bad choice and I
[1:56:44] had sought to do my own will and not
[1:56:46] your will I want you to know today every
[1:56:48] bit of that can be redeemed I want to
[1:56:51] say that very carefully again again you
[1:56:54] are not just a church member out there
[1:56:56] somewhere you are a part of the elected
[1:56:59] predestinated seed of Jesus Christ and
[1:57:03] because of that nothing about you
[1:57:05] nothing concerning you is unredeemable
[1:57:08] he can redeem every thought that he ever
[1:57:12] had toward you
[1:57:14] no matter what a mess I made no matter
[1:57:17] what a mess you made
[1:57:19] no matter how we really really really
[1:57:22] got off course
[1:57:24] he can redeem every year
[1:57:27] I need help
[1:57:29] he can redeem every month
[1:57:31] he can redeem every hour
[1:57:33] you see every child of God has a book
[1:57:35] written about him or her God saw us in
[1:57:38] our fleshly form in the earth before we
[1:57:41] ever existed he saw our days he saw it
[1:57:45] all including our choices and decisions
[1:57:48] he knew then about our abilities our
[1:57:51] strengths he knew our gifts even then
[1:57:54] before the foundation of the world he
[1:57:57] knew that some would be able to sing and
[1:58:00] it would be somewhat melodious and
[1:58:02] others would sing barely carrying a tune
[1:58:05] in a bucket he already knew that he knew
[1:58:08] that some would set out to learn the
[1:58:09] guitar and three weeks later would give
[1:58:12] up and never learn to play but he knew
[1:58:14] there would be some that would love it
[1:58:16] with a passion
[1:58:18] and they wouldn't only learn to play it
[1:58:19] they would learn to teach others to play
[1:58:21] it and they would not only do it with
[1:58:23] skill they would do it with anointing he
[1:58:26] knew that 90 of the population would say
[1:58:29] at one point or another I would like to
[1:58:31] play the piano
[1:58:35] anybody in this room ever said I'd like
[1:58:37] to play the piano or the keyboard hold
[1:58:39] your hand up it's 90 percent of the
[1:58:41] world's population by the way
[1:58:44] even people that have never seen a piano
[1:58:46] except on the video have said I'd like
[1:58:48] to play that
[1:58:49] but how many of you know the proof is in
[1:58:52] the pursuit
[1:58:54] do you really want to play it
[1:58:56] if you really wanted to play it you'd
[1:58:58] stick it out
[1:59:00] you'd take a lesson or two did you know
[1:59:02] God knew that everybody who said I want
[1:59:04] to learn to play the piano wouldn't
[1:59:06] learn
[1:59:07] but he knew there would be some that
[1:59:09] would learn he knew there are some that
[1:59:11] would be gifted in it
[1:59:14] he knew there would be some you had to
[1:59:16] beg them put Dynamite under them
[1:59:20] to get him up to play the piano
[1:59:22] he knew there would be others so
[1:59:24] confident in what God had given them
[1:59:26] that you'd never have to beg them to
[1:59:27] play that even in the times that they
[1:59:30] didn't feel good or feel like it they
[1:59:32] would still give that gift back to God
[1:59:34] because it was what they were created to
[1:59:35] do and they would teach other people to
[1:59:37] do it he would know that tens of
[1:59:39] thousands of millions of people would
[1:59:41] desire to preach
[1:59:43] and some of them wouldn't make it past
[1:59:45] the first 45 days
[1:59:53] he knew that there would be others who
[1:59:55] would receive a call even at an early
[1:59:58] age in their life or a late age as a
[2:00:00] second call a second vocation
[2:00:02] and that they would be faithful to that
[2:00:04] call to the last day that they would
[2:00:06] live on the earth he knew that
[2:00:09] he knew that some would get married and
[2:00:12] nine months later would have a baby
[2:00:13] without any problem
[2:00:15] he knew there would be others that would
[2:00:16] wait a year two years three years four
[2:00:20] years five years six years seven years
[2:00:24] eight years nine years ten years trying
[2:00:29] to have a baby like brother and sister
[2:00:32] West 10 years of waiting hoping
[2:00:37] believing to have a baby God knew that
[2:00:42] he knew that Stacy and I would marry and
[2:00:45] nine months later
[2:00:46] we would have a baby
[2:00:48] but he knew that brother and sister Wes
[2:00:50] 10 years into their marriage would still
[2:00:53] finally finally at 10 years be expecting
[2:00:56] a baby there was a journey there was
[2:00:58] something set in there there was a
[2:01:00] servant of God who had to have a part of
[2:01:02] their story
[2:01:04] God's got some characters in your story
[2:01:07] that you've not yet met
[2:01:10] he's got some you've dodged in Walmart
[2:01:12] but you're going to meet him again
[2:01:15] because they're part of your story
[2:01:22] some are strange
[2:01:23] you run the other way
[2:01:26] God's going to run them your way before
[2:01:27] it's over
[2:01:29] you're gonna have to be the one that God
[2:01:30] uses to speak into their life let me
[2:01:33] tell you something you can run from a
[2:01:35] lot of things but you're not going to
[2:01:36] run from God's thoughts toward you he's
[2:01:38] got them wrote down he'll bring you back
[2:01:40] around brother and sister Wes wanted to
[2:01:43] have a baby her daddy was a pastor his
[2:01:45] dad was a preacher they were ministers
[2:01:48] they were in the Assemblies of God they
[2:01:50] loved the Lord with all their heart they
[2:01:52] recognized in the 1950s that God had
[2:01:55] sent a prophet who was operating in a
[2:01:58] wonderful anointing with a very high
[2:02:00] call from the Lord and was having
[2:02:02] healing meetings that were unprecedented
[2:02:04] in many many ways they would go to some
[2:02:06] of those meetings brother Benny West's
[2:02:09] dad would befriend this man through his
[2:02:11] dad excuse me Benny West would get to
[2:02:15] know brother Branham through his dad
[2:02:17] knowing brother Branham they would share
[2:02:19] meals together they would drive from
[2:02:21] from Huntsville or from the northern
[2:02:24] part of Alabama all the way to
[2:02:26] Jeffersonville Indiana a weekend after
[2:02:29] weekend after weekend to hear the word
[2:02:32] to see the Miracles to be a part of what
[2:02:35] God was doing in those days before there
[2:02:38] were highways before there were
[2:02:40] interstates they had a desire a drawing
[2:02:43] a knowing and because of that a
[2:02:45] relationship developed
[2:02:47] and brother Benny West's daddy said to
[2:02:50] brother Branham my my son and his wife
[2:02:53] would like to have a child if you just
[2:02:56] pray for them if you get a chance maybe
[2:02:58] you just pray for them they're in the
[2:03:00] meetings in North Carolina going
[2:03:02] somewhere between I can't remember what
[2:03:05] the first meetings were but three Pines
[2:03:07] was one of the places that they were
[2:03:08] going it's in those North Carolina
[2:03:10] Spindale maybe it's one of those uh
[2:03:13] North Carolina meetings that he did back
[2:03:15] to back they're getting in they're
[2:03:17] getting out of the motel room checking
[2:03:20] out one morning and uh at the same time
[2:03:23] that brother Brandon is checking out he
[2:03:25] walks over to the car where they're
[2:03:26] about to get in the car and he says to
[2:03:29] them so I understand that you all would
[2:03:31] like to have children yes sir we would
[2:03:33] like to have children he says to brother
[2:03:35] Betty West slide over and brother
[2:03:38] Branham sits behind the driver's seat of
[2:03:41] their own automobile brother West is in
[2:03:44] the middle he has had him to slide over
[2:03:46] sister West is is on the other side
[2:03:49] they're sitting there brother Brandon
[2:03:50] begins to talk to them about how
[2:03:52] wonderful it is to desire children and
[2:03:55] how when you have children you ought to
[2:03:58] raise them in church you ought to get
[2:04:00] them in Sunday school you ought to teach
[2:04:02] them the things of the Lord and they
[2:04:05] readily agree both of them being raised
[2:04:07] in Christian homes sister West being the
[2:04:09] daughter of a pastor they had no problem
[2:04:12] with those beautiful words of
[2:04:14] encouragement that brother Branham was
[2:04:16] giving to them he begins to to go off a
[2:04:19] little bit in Vision it seems and he
[2:04:22] touched the windshield wiper and he says
[2:04:25] what is this
[2:04:28] brother Branham brother West begins to
[2:04:31] explain to brother Branham it's the
[2:04:33] windshield wiper brother banham looks at
[2:04:35] him and he says you know why I'm doing
[2:04:37] that don't you and brother West shakes
[2:04:39] his head we all know now that brother
[2:04:41] West didn't really have a clue until
[2:04:43] later
[2:04:45] and always kidded him about it I say you
[2:04:47] can't lie to a prophet
[2:04:49] he knew when he asked you you didn't
[2:04:51] have a clue what he was doing but he
[2:04:53] also knew that one day you'd figure it
[2:04:55] out
[2:04:56] because when I got the story many years
[2:04:59] later brother I said I know now that he
[2:05:02] was going into vision and he would do
[2:05:04] things like that he told us to break the
[2:05:07] vision so that it didn't take a toll on
[2:05:09] his body because he was going to the
[2:05:11] next meeting
[2:05:13] so brother random again he he looks at
[2:05:15] them and maybe says some little prayer
[2:05:17] doesn't make any prophecy or prediction
[2:05:19] except for this when you have children
[2:05:24] remember raise them in church and get
[2:05:27] them in Sunday school and that's just
[2:05:30] about the end of it
[2:05:31] by the way I said I can't remember a
[2:05:33] prayer maybe there's a little prayer I
[2:05:34] can't remember what he said don't
[2:05:36] remember the amen not sure what happened
[2:05:38] after that but he remembered when
[2:05:40] brother Branham got out of the vehicle
[2:05:42] they remembered that brother Branham
[2:05:44] said when you have children
[2:05:48] God saw that from the beginning
[2:05:50] ten years into their marriage and this
[2:05:54] encounter that they had with the prophet
[2:05:56] of God God saw all of that
[2:06:01] before the foundation of the world and
[2:06:03] whatever was preventing them from having
[2:06:05] a child it was lifted
[2:06:08] but it couldn't be lifted until that
[2:06:11] experienced that that was a play that
[2:06:13] was what what the prophet called The
[2:06:15] Junction in time
[2:06:17] I know this is too much for some I'm not
[2:06:20] preaching to you I'm preaching to the
[2:06:22] others
[2:06:23] this was a junction in time the
[2:06:29] because God
[2:06:31] and our lives
[2:06:33] have come together at Junctions
[2:06:37] and all we can say is blessed be the
[2:06:40] name of the Lord
[2:06:41] some of those Junctions were painful
[2:06:45] some of them were Grievous some of them
[2:06:47] drove us almost insane
[2:06:51] but every one of them were necessary
[2:06:57] because before the foundation of the
[2:06:59] world God had thoughts toward us he knew
[2:07:02] what we were going to think he knew what
[2:07:04] we were going to say he knew what we
[2:07:06] were going to do
[2:07:08] and the outcome had been written every
[2:07:10] one of our days written
[2:07:12] written written written written written
[2:07:16] there's two fellas in the church this
[2:07:18] morning
[2:07:19] one of them came to me
[2:07:22] last Sunday afternoon
[2:07:25] I was it must have been
[2:07:28] six o'clock
[2:07:30] I was still in church clothes
[2:07:32] I had not even got to go home yet to
[2:07:34] change clothes
[2:07:35] I'm at the back of my vehicle and one of
[2:07:38] the Two Fellas walks up to me right out
[2:07:41] there and says
[2:07:43] so and so and I have been smoking
[2:07:47] brisket
[2:07:58] isn't that terrible
[2:07:59] isn't that awful who would do that to
[2:08:02] their pastor
[2:08:05] no pipes involved
[2:08:07] no joints involved
[2:08:09] just smoke
[2:08:12] and Heavenly brisket
[2:08:14] so I said I'm so Disturbed I can't hear
[2:08:16] the rest of what you've got to say
[2:08:19] but somehow I broke myself out of my
[2:08:22] nervous condition and found out that
[2:08:24] they wanted to prepare a meal for us
[2:08:28] and we got to go and have that meal and
[2:08:31] I want you to know it was not to heaven
[2:08:37] not to heaven
[2:08:38] I thought about it every single day
[2:08:41] since then
[2:08:44] I thought about those few little strips
[2:08:46] of brisket that was left there laying in
[2:08:48] the bowl and one of the brothers said
[2:08:49] went on brother Shelley you know if you
[2:08:51] wanted to take that you could take it
[2:08:52] dum dum dum me
[2:08:56] I said no brother it's expensive brisk
[2:08:58] is expensive I know you all paid a lot
[2:09:00] for that and you all would probably
[2:09:01] enjoy that and eat that I've seen it
[2:09:03] laying in the bowl
[2:09:07] everything I've eaten since then I
[2:09:10] thought sure would be good with a slab
[2:09:11] of that brisket
[2:09:17] I am so far out
[2:09:19] with what I believe
[2:09:23] that I believe that every part of that
[2:09:26] was for a reason
[2:09:28] not just to fill my belly with good
[2:09:30] brisket
[2:09:31] I believe there was a reason we were
[2:09:33] gathered together the way we were and
[2:09:36] everybody in the room that was supposed
[2:09:38] to be in the room was in the room and I
[2:09:41] believe that even in our fellowship
[2:09:43] together we were accomplishing something
[2:09:46] I can't say for sure what it was but I
[2:09:51] love the feeling of going to bed at
[2:09:54] night and knowing that I have been today
[2:09:57] where God wanted me to be
[2:10:00] I want you and I to have a desire like
[2:10:04] never before to be in the will of God to
[2:10:08] know the will of God for our lives to
[2:10:10] discover not what he will permit us to
[2:10:13] do but what he would prefer for us to do
[2:10:18] I believe the Lord saw me as a little
[2:10:20] boy living near near Brunswick Georgia
[2:10:23] Saint Simon's Island I believe God saw
[2:10:27] the misery in my life as I went to bed
[2:10:30] every night and heard my mother beat
[2:10:32] nearly to a pope I believe God saw my
[2:10:35] heart's desire as I stood at the window
[2:10:38] on Sunday morning and saw the little
[2:10:41] children getting on the Assembly of
[2:10:43] God's Church bus to go to Sunday school
[2:10:46] and I beg my mother and my stepfather to
[2:10:50] let me go to church with all the other
[2:10:52] children but my my stepfather had been
[2:10:55] raised in a Pentecostal foster home and
[2:10:58] had been terribly physically abused
[2:11:00] there he didn't want anything to do with
[2:11:02] Pentecost he said maybe if I found a
[2:11:05] Baptist Church he would let me go but he
[2:11:07] didn't want me to go to a Pentecostal
[2:11:09] church I stood Sunday after Sunday with
[2:11:12] tears running down my face begging the
[2:11:14] Lord to make a way
[2:11:16] that I could go to church and worship
[2:11:19] him whenever I wanted to go now let me
[2:11:22] tell you something what did that do for
[2:11:24] you I make sure that I'm in church
[2:11:30] you look back over the years of my life
[2:11:33] and I want to be where God's people are
[2:11:35] gathered together in his name I want to
[2:11:37] be there when the doors are open if I
[2:11:39] possibly can that's where I want to be
[2:11:41] because there was a time I didn't have a
[2:11:43] choice
[2:11:44] but as soon as I got my choice I wanted
[2:11:47] I don't want to be a once a month
[2:11:48] Christian
[2:11:51] I don't want to be a once every six
[2:11:52] month Christian I want to be where God
[2:11:55] would have me to be every day of my life
[2:11:58] and I'm encouraging you today
[2:12:01] I'm encouraging you to have the same
[2:12:03] desire now I know only the Lord can put
[2:12:05] that in us only the Lord can pour oil on
[2:12:08] that in our lives but I beg you in the
[2:12:11] name of the Lord do not settle for what
[2:12:13] he will permit
[2:12:15] discover what he prefers
[2:12:19] you have to work a job that's junk job
[2:12:21] until you can get to the place where God
[2:12:24] puts you in the job that he has for you
[2:12:26] you do that but don't you give up on
[2:12:30] what God has
[2:12:32] if God's put it in your heart to build a
[2:12:34] business don't you give up on that
[2:12:37] because it gets difficult don't you give
[2:12:39] up on that because it looks hard you
[2:12:42] keep holding on you provide for your
[2:12:44] family with whatever honest work you can
[2:12:47] get but don't you give up
[2:12:52] because the desire for it may be it may
[2:12:55] be an unsanctified part of Who You Are
[2:12:58] could be it could be an unsanctified
[2:13:01] part of who you are that wants to make
[2:13:03] money doing nothing
[2:13:05] hello could be could be or it might be a
[2:13:09] god-breathed desire
[2:13:12] that he is anybody with me
[2:13:15] seems a little scattered but I'm doing
[2:13:16] what I can that's all I can do is what I
[2:13:18] can
[2:13:19] it seems to me like somehow it could
[2:13:22] possibly be that the Lord has breathed
[2:13:24] that desire in you
[2:13:25] so do you want to spend all the days of
[2:13:27] your life working for someone else if
[2:13:29] God has breathed in you
[2:13:31] the inspiration and the desire to do
[2:13:35] something where you have your own hours
[2:13:37] if you're looking let me just tell you
[2:13:39] this though just out of common sense if
[2:13:41] you're looking to build a business so
[2:13:42] you can work two days a week
[2:13:46] you better keep the job you got
[2:13:49] in fact you better Moonlight at the
[2:13:51] donut shop
[2:13:53] because that's not how you build a
[2:13:55] business let me tell you something
[2:13:57] there's years of hard work sometime that
[2:13:59] go in and lean times and pray in times
[2:14:03] there are times that put you on your
[2:14:04] knees and that's all right too because
[2:14:06] God knows what it takes to get us in
[2:14:08] desperation before him but don't you let
[2:14:11] somebody discourage you when you know
[2:14:13] that you've picked up on an inspiration
[2:14:15] from the Lord and if you've waited two
[2:14:18] years or three years for the youngins or
[2:14:20] four years for the youngin or five years
[2:14:22] for don't you dare accept anything less
[2:14:25] than what God knew about you
[2:14:32] he even knew our weaknesses
[2:14:35] you're still here
[2:14:37] these thoughts were then recorded in the
[2:14:39] Heavenly record
[2:14:40] I want to read it again he saw it all
[2:14:42] including our choices decisions he knew
[2:14:44] our abilities strengths gifts and even
[2:14:46] our weaknesses these thoughts were then
[2:14:49] recorded in the Heavenly record the
[2:14:51] destiny and Kingdom Purpose for each of
[2:14:54] Our Lives
[2:14:55] was written long before we were ever
[2:14:59] born
[2:15:01] not just the number of them
[2:15:03] but he saw the activities in them and he
[2:15:06] saw what we would accomplish in our
[2:15:09] lives our individual book is a written
[2:15:12] record of all which God planned for us
[2:15:15] and the kingdom impact that he has
[2:15:17] destined for each of Our Lives there's a
[2:15:21] battle going on and the battle is to get
[2:15:23] whatever is in the book about your life
[2:15:27] to manifest here on the Earth
[2:15:30] want to say it again there's a battle
[2:15:33] going on and that battle is to get
[2:15:35] everything written of you in God's book
[2:15:37] to come to pass at your destiny that's
[2:15:41] his plan that's his will and we're
[2:15:44] battling to get that to come to pass
[2:15:45] here on the earth and let me tell you
[2:15:47] something the way we battle for our
[2:15:49] destiny is not with guns
[2:15:53] the way we battle for our destiny is
[2:15:55] with tears
[2:15:57] it's with prayer it's with fasting it's
[2:16:00] with seeking the Lord that is how we
[2:16:03] find and discover God's will for our
[2:16:06] life it's by going to him by sitting in
[2:16:08] his presence by basking in his love
[2:16:11] that's how we discover what God has for
[2:16:14] us in the message Dr Moses would you
[2:16:17] show us that paragraph 34 of the message
[2:16:21] Dr Moses
[2:16:23] he said in the mind of God Christ was
[2:16:29] already
[2:16:31] crucified
[2:16:34] before Christ was born
[2:16:38] before the second temple period
[2:16:42] Christ was already crucified in the mind
[2:16:45] of God if you believe that's amen for he
[2:16:49] was the lamb slain from the foundation
[2:16:52] of the world
[2:16:54] he said back in Eden
[2:16:57] watch this
[2:16:59] Christ in God's thoughts
[2:17:03] which became his word
[2:17:07] had not yet
[2:17:10] materialized
[2:17:17] I want to make sure you catch that
[2:17:19] it means that Christ was crucified
[2:17:23] before he ever materialized
[2:17:27] he wasn't even born
[2:17:30] and yet in the mind of his father in the
[2:17:33] mind of gods he was already what
[2:17:36] crucified Christ in God's thoughts which
[2:17:40] became his word had not yet materialized
[2:17:43] but he knew what it was
[2:17:46] for he had
[2:17:48] promised it and he let the children of
[2:17:51] Israel listen
[2:17:53] and he let the children of Israel draw
[2:17:55] interest
[2:17:58] thank you
[2:18:02] who's ever heard of this kind of
[2:18:04] economics
[2:18:05] this is not the economics of the First
[2:18:08] National Bank
[2:18:09] this is the economics of the kingdom of
[2:18:12] God the children of Israel were already
[2:18:15] drawing benefits from a crucifixion that
[2:18:18] had not even taken place from a savior
[2:18:21] who had not yet been born but had
[2:18:24] already died in the mind of God
[2:18:27] how is that possible
[2:18:30] because that's who he is
[2:18:32] that's how big your God is you don't
[2:18:35] think he can help you with your problem
[2:18:38] you don't think he can help you with
[2:18:40] your broken toe
[2:18:41] you don't think he can help you with
[2:18:43] your migraine
[2:18:45] you don't think he can see you through
[2:18:47] your cold
[2:18:48] or your cough
[2:18:51] you don't think God can get you through
[2:18:53] that but yet he can let the children of
[2:18:55] Israel become beneficiaries and withdraw
[2:18:57] from a deposit that had not yet even
[2:18:59] been made
[2:19:01] they were blessed because of a future
[2:19:05] installment of God's grace toward
[2:19:07] mankind
[2:19:09] they got healing under a lesser Covenant
[2:19:12] that was promised to those of a greater
[2:19:16] Covenant
[2:19:17] they kept they looked upon a brass
[2:19:19] Serpent and they received the Divine
[2:19:21] Healing of the cross
[2:19:23] that had not yet even taken place there
[2:19:26] had not yet even been a cross you know
[2:19:28] what that says to me it says God's had
[2:19:30] it under control since the beginning of
[2:19:34] time he's never lost a case
[2:19:42] now here's something we have to remember
[2:19:45] even Jesus had a destiny
[2:19:48] that was already chosen for him
[2:19:51] by his father
[2:19:53] it was recorded before he came into the
[2:19:55] Earth to fulfill the plan if you believe
[2:19:57] that same man look at Hebrews chapter
[2:20:00] 10.
[2:20:01] verse 5 through 9.
[2:20:09] you're still here
[2:20:10] wherefore when he cometh into the world
[2:20:13] he saith
[2:20:15] sacrifice and offering thou what is not
[2:20:18] but a body hast thou prepared me
[2:20:23] and burn offerings and sacrifices for
[2:20:27] sin has had no pleasure
[2:20:30] then said I lo
[2:20:36] I come
[2:20:38] in the volume of the book it is written
[2:20:42] of me
[2:20:45] to do thy will
[2:20:47] oh God
[2:20:49] this comes from Messianic Prophecy of
[2:20:51] the older Covenant
[2:20:52] here's the Apostle Paul pulling from
[2:20:55] that older Covenant and helping the
[2:20:57] Hebrew Believers to understand that even
[2:21:00] our Lord Jesus Christ 100 God 100 man
[2:21:03] was still on the earth and every day of
[2:21:06] his life here on the earth he was living
[2:21:09] out the volume of the book that had been
[2:21:12] written about him that's powerful
[2:21:14] it speaks of the sovereignty of God it
[2:21:17] speaks of the obedience to the
[2:21:19] commission and it speaks to every battle
[2:21:21] that our Lord went through the Bible
[2:21:23] said though he were a son yet learned he
[2:21:25] obedience what by the things he suffered
[2:21:28] and though he was tempted in all like
[2:21:30] manner as we are what did the Bible say
[2:21:32] about his overcoming power yet without
[2:21:35] sin
[2:21:37] so even our Lord
[2:21:40] was restrained to a life and a Ministry
[2:21:46] that had already been written
[2:21:49] in a book about him
[2:21:56] to do thy will o God
[2:21:59] above when he said sacrifice and
[2:22:02] offering and burn offerings and offering
[2:22:04] for sin thou what is not neither has
[2:22:07] pleasure therein which are offered by
[2:22:09] the law
[2:22:11] then said he law I come to do thy will o
[2:22:16] God
[2:22:17] he taketh away the first
[2:22:20] that he may establish the second
[2:22:29] this is a surrender
[2:22:35] because Jesus was a hundred percent man
[2:22:38] he had a will
[2:22:41] how do we know that Gethsemane
[2:22:45] not my will nevertheless
[2:22:48] if at all possible let this cup pass
[2:22:50] from me nevertheless what did he say not
[2:22:54] my will
[2:22:57] so just because you have a book written
[2:22:59] about your life doesn't mean you don't
[2:23:01] have a will
[2:23:03] and it doesn't mean that there will not
[2:23:05] be times many times
[2:23:08] that your will and his will will be in
[2:23:12] conflict
[2:23:14] and it is in that moment that we must
[2:23:17] learn to quickly throw ourselves on the
[2:23:20] mercy of The Rock
[2:23:22] [Music]
[2:23:23] because whosoever falleth upon the rock
[2:23:26] shall be what
[2:23:27] broken but whosoever the rock shall fall
[2:23:30] upon shall be crushed to powder
[2:23:34] so it's better for you to say oh god
[2:23:36] I've been striving for my will throw
[2:23:39] yourself on the rock
[2:23:42] my will
[2:23:43] but your will be done
[2:23:46] you know a lot of people choose their
[2:23:48] will because their will seems easier it
[2:23:50] seems more convenient it seems like
[2:23:53] there's less sacrifice
[2:23:55] but I want you to know if you've ever
[2:23:57] made a sacrifice to do the will of God
[2:23:59] you'll get it back time and time and
[2:24:03] time again if you ever heard a call of
[2:24:06] God that said get you out from among
[2:24:08] your father's Kindred and I will take
[2:24:10] you to a place or to a land of which
[2:24:13] you've never known if you've ever had
[2:24:15] that kind of call and you packed up your
[2:24:17] stuff and you hit the road to do what
[2:24:19] God told you to do you'll never suffer
[2:24:22] because of that he'll give it back to
[2:24:24] you press down shaken together and
[2:24:28] running over you'll never lose family
[2:24:30] and not gain another family God always
[2:24:33] will
[2:24:35] if we're willing
[2:24:40] a Baptist man
[2:24:42] who prophesied over brother Branham
[2:24:45] because thou Hast chosen the harder way
[2:24:51] a huge portion of Heaven Waits you
[2:24:54] how many of you believe that wasn't just
[2:24:55] for a prophet how many of you believe
[2:24:57] that's for any servant of the Lord if
[2:25:00] you'll choose the harder way which
[2:25:02] sometimes is his perfect plan for your
[2:25:05] life sometimes that's a harder way it's
[2:25:07] not always such but sometimes it's a
[2:25:09] harder way somebody's struggling today
[2:25:11] to do God's perfect will but you won't
[2:25:14] have to struggle if you'll just throw
[2:25:15] yourself on the Rock break me
[2:25:19] break my will
[2:25:21] break my will if that's what it takes
[2:25:24] Here I Am Lord asking you to help my
[2:25:26] will but if my will needs more than help
[2:25:30] if my will needs to be broken I throw
[2:25:33] myself on the rock
[2:25:35] break me where I need to be broken
[2:25:37] because it'd be far better for me to be
[2:25:40] broken by casting myself on the Rock
[2:25:42] than to have the rock to fall on me and
[2:25:44] crush me to a pile of powder
[2:25:48] there is a consequence
[2:25:50] for continuing to choose our own will
[2:25:52] and our own way when there's a book
[2:25:54] that's already been written is anybody
[2:25:56] hearing what the Lord's trying to say to
[2:25:58] us today I hope you are
[2:26:00] there was a book in heaven
[2:26:02] that chronicled what Kingdom Purpose
[2:26:04] Jesus would fulfill in the earth and he
[2:26:07] was marching out step by step minute by
[2:26:10] minute moment by moment Choice by choice
[2:26:13] he was stepping out that plan that the
[2:26:15] father had for him in the message Divine
[2:26:18] love
[2:26:20] let's take a look at it in the time we
[2:26:22] have last Sunday with you here I believe
[2:26:26] I preached on the assurance
[2:26:28] the power that God had promised and
[2:26:32] ordained you and called you before the
[2:26:35] foundation of the world and put your
[2:26:37] name in his book I'd like for somebody
[2:26:39] to read me that next line
[2:26:49] you didn't choose your mama
[2:26:52] you didn't choose your daddy
[2:26:55] you didn't choose your race
[2:26:58] every bit of these things were chosen on
[2:27:01] our behalf we didn't have anything to do
[2:27:04] with it God did it
[2:27:07] he said isn't that wonderful I think it
[2:27:10] is the Lamb was slain before the
[2:27:12] foundation of the world and why
[2:27:15] it never happened till 4
[2:27:18] 000 years later
[2:27:24] the realization
[2:27:26] and the reality of what God had on his
[2:27:30] mind before the foundation of the world
[2:27:32] took 4 000 years to be a reality on the
[2:27:36] Earth but here's the key to remember God
[2:27:39] was letting his people withdraw from the
[2:27:42] bank that had never received the deposit
[2:27:45] for four thousand years they were eating
[2:27:49] of the goodness of God that were only
[2:27:51] attainable under the full Redemption and
[2:27:53] the full Redemption had not yet been
[2:27:55] given so God is a good god I want to say
[2:27:58] one more time and I hope you never
[2:28:01] misunderstand me when I say he fixed it
[2:28:05] I hope you always understand what I mean
[2:28:08] everything that God requires of us he
[2:28:11] provides for us
[2:28:13] so that we can't lose
[2:28:16] you cannot fail he said his bride cannot
[2:28:20] fail he said
[2:28:21] why because he's always there if you'll
[2:28:24] call on him when I Call On Jesus
[2:28:28] it never happened till 4 000 years later
[2:28:30] but God when he spoke it
[2:28:34] um
[2:28:38] he had to do it
[2:28:40] because he has to keep his word
[2:28:44] and the same time remember all those
[2:28:46] times God never changes his mind about
[2:28:48] his word
[2:28:50] because he can't
[2:28:51] he's Bound by his own word and the same
[2:28:54] time that the lamb was wrote down you
[2:28:57] were wrote with him and the same time
[2:28:59] the lamb and the same time that the lamb
[2:29:02] was wrote down you
[2:29:07] or wrote with him
[2:29:09] when it made it to the book that the
[2:29:12] lamb is going to come
[2:29:14] four thousand years after the creation
[2:29:17] the lamb is going to come
[2:29:19] and he's going to die on a cross
[2:29:22] crucified at the hands of his own men
[2:29:24] his own people
[2:29:27] with the help of a Roman occupier
[2:29:31] when all of this was recorded in that
[2:29:33] book the prophet tells us here you were
[2:29:38] wrote with him
[2:29:41] this is a confirmation that the bride
[2:29:44] was with him
[2:29:46] even in him
[2:29:48] in the beginning and the Bible tells us
[2:29:51] in the New Testament nothing can
[2:29:53] separate you from that place
[2:29:57] that's his love
[2:29:59] nothing can separate us from the love of
[2:30:02] God if you believe that say Amen you
[2:30:04] were wrote with him our names
[2:30:06] were written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:30:09] not the night we come to Christ
[2:30:13] remember the old hymn there's a new name
[2:30:15] written down in glory the scripture
[2:30:18] doesn't say that the scripture says
[2:30:20] before the foundation of the world the
[2:30:23] Bible said so so that's the assurance
[2:30:27] Blessed assurance
[2:30:30] [Music]
[2:30:32] Jesus Is Mine
[2:30:36] oh what up
[2:30:38] for
[2:30:40] Taste Of Glory divine

[2:34:04] praising my saved your
[2:34:09] all the day long
[2:34:13] be seated just
[2:34:15] a moment Jesus came
[2:34:18] with a passion
[2:34:20] and with a commitment to complete what
[2:34:24] had been written in the books of Heaven
[2:34:26] about him the ministry of the Lamb was
[2:34:31] pre-planned in the mind of God and
[2:34:34] recorded ahead of time in the book of
[2:34:37] redemption prophetically do you believe
[2:34:39] that in the message influence brother
[2:34:42] Branham said now if you want your
[2:34:45] example
[2:34:46] to lay aside your pattern
[2:34:50] to see what the scripture goes together
[2:34:53] with just lay Jesus over here and go to
[2:34:57] watching him and placed it in the Bible
[2:35:02] you got the whole thing come out right
[2:35:06] because it's the
[2:35:08] of Jesus Christ the New Testament and
[2:35:11] Old both all speak of Jesus see Jesus
[2:35:18] Christ the son of God because he is the
[2:35:22] this book of redemption
[2:35:26] you understand Jesus is the book
[2:35:32] he is the book
[2:35:33] he is the book of redemption he was the
[2:35:36] word
[2:35:37] and he is the word and that's bound to
[2:35:41] be him you see
[2:35:42] so this is the whole book of redemption
[2:35:46] which is Jesus Christ
[2:35:49] fitly put together by God
[2:35:54] let me give you the visual
[2:35:57] he was the word and he is the word and
[2:36:00] that's bound to be him you see so this
[2:36:03] is the whole book of redemption which is
[2:36:05] Jesus Christ fitly put together by God
[2:36:09] with the promises of redemption and
[2:36:11] healing and everything for the human
[2:36:13] being see everything we have need of is
[2:36:16] there
[2:36:17] he said do you get that now and I want
[2:36:19] you to read the next sentence for me
[2:36:21] would you
[2:36:22] thank you
[2:36:23] Jesus Christ
[2:36:26] this book is Jesus Christ
[2:36:32] Old Testament and New
[2:36:34] he's in every offering
[2:36:37] he's in every sacrifice
[2:36:39] he's in all the temple order in the
[2:36:41] Tabernacle order he's in the worship of
[2:36:44] the old and in the new
[2:36:45] every every piece of furniture points to
[2:36:48] Jesus in the Tabernacle every every
[2:36:50] curtain points to Jesus
[2:36:53] every brass knob points to Jesus the
[2:36:56] Candlestick the shoe bread the labor
[2:36:59] everything points to Jesus the book is
[2:37:01] Jesus Christ put together by God see and
[2:37:04] he come as a human being and redeemed us
[2:37:06] and every promise is in him and for you
[2:37:11] for he is what
[2:37:13] he's the Redeemer
[2:37:16] just a little more in closing
[2:37:18] I want you to read John 1 14 in the
[2:37:21] Amplified
[2:37:24] and the word
[2:37:26] Christ
[2:37:29] and the word Christ
[2:37:31] became flesh human incarnate
[2:37:35] and tabernacled
[2:37:38] I love this
[2:37:40] fixed his tent of Flesh and lived a
[2:37:43] while
[2:37:47] for you
[2:37:49] he tabernacled he fixed this tent of
[2:37:52] Flesh lived a while Among Us
[2:37:55] and we actually saw his glory his honor
[2:38:00] his majesty
[2:38:02] such Glory as an only begotten son
[2:38:05] receives from his father full of grace
[2:38:09] favor loving kindness
[2:38:14] and Truth
[2:38:16] his physical birth allowed what was
[2:38:20] written in the book of Heaven
[2:38:22] to be manifested about him
[2:38:24] in the flesh
[2:38:26] God's word became fleshed out
[2:38:31] and Jesus lived every day to do his
[2:38:36] father's will John 5 19 and 20 then
[2:38:39] answered Jesus and said unto them verily
[2:38:42] verily I say unto you the son can do
[2:38:44] nothing of himself but what he seeth the
[2:38:47] father do for what things soever he
[2:38:49] doeth these also doeth the son likewise
[2:38:52] for the Father loveth the Son and
[2:38:55] showeth him all things about excuse me
[2:38:59] and showeth him all things that himself
[2:39:02] doeth and he will show him Greater Works
[2:39:06] than these
[2:39:08] that you may Marvel
[2:39:10] see Jesus was just being led by vision
[2:39:12] of his father
[2:39:15] and where did the vision come from it
[2:39:17] come out of the book
[2:39:20] there's a bride in the Earth
[2:39:22] the Sperma of God the seed of God is
[2:39:26] that correct and do you know what her
[2:39:28] commission is
[2:39:29] to live every day
[2:39:31] out of the vision of the book
[2:39:35] now that means that somebody's going to
[2:39:37] have to quit wrestling with God
[2:39:41] foreign
[2:39:42] it means someone is going to have to be
[2:39:44] sitting stop setting an enmity against
[2:39:47] God and say God I'm I'm ready for you to
[2:39:49] live my life
[2:39:51] I'm ready for you to come and direct my
[2:39:53] path I'm trying to tired of trying to
[2:39:56] figure it out by myself
[2:39:58] I need your help
[2:40:00] John 5 30 same chapter
[2:40:03] verse 30 he said I can of mine own self
[2:40:06] do nothing as I as I hear I judge and my
[2:40:11] judgment is just because I seek not my
[2:40:14] own will but the will of the father
[2:40:17] which hath sent me
[2:40:19] in the little film the 20th century
[2:40:22] prophet
[2:40:23] brother Branham says this
[2:40:26] but here I'll quote his words
[2:40:29] he said verily verily I say unto you the
[2:40:34] son can do nothing of himself but what
[2:40:37] he sees the father do this doeth the son
[2:40:40] likewise then
[2:40:42] according to his own words his ministry
[2:40:47] was based upon Visions from his
[2:40:52] father
[2:40:54] he saw it in the spirit
[2:40:58] and he did it
[2:41:01] I don't think anybody in this room
[2:41:03] believes that Jesus healed every sick
[2:41:05] person
[2:41:07] I think we've all read the Gospels
[2:41:09] I think we've read that the Bible said
[2:41:12] if everything that he did everything he
[2:41:14] said if it were recorded in a book that
[2:41:17] the worlds that's why I don't get bent
[2:41:19] out of shape like some religious folks
[2:41:21] do if you see something portrayed in a
[2:41:24] film or something like that that's a
[2:41:26] little more or a little different or or
[2:41:28] a connection May somebody really raked
[2:41:30] me over the colds this week
[2:41:32] because they said there's nowhere in the
[2:41:35] Bible that Peter's wife had a
[2:41:37] miscarriage
[2:41:41] I said my dear religious brother
[2:41:44] that's how I dress the answer my dear
[2:41:46] religious brother there's nothing in the
[2:41:49] word that says that Peter's wife didn't
[2:41:52] have a miscarriage
[2:41:57] God bless you brother Shelley
[2:42:09] he wanted 10 pages out of me
[2:42:13] but I didn't have 10 pages to give him
[2:42:16] if everything that went that went on in
[2:42:19] the three and a half years of our Lord's
[2:42:21] Earthly Ministry if everything that
[2:42:24] happened to him and everything that
[2:42:25] happened around him was written in the
[2:42:27] book The Worlds wouldn't contain the
[2:42:28] book here's what I say somebody had a
[2:42:31] miscarriage
[2:42:33] somebody had a broken heart
[2:42:36] somebody was going through something
[2:42:38] whether it was Peter's wife or not and
[2:42:41] Jesus could only minister to her
[2:42:43] according to a vision from his father
[2:42:50] sometimes a modern Church says I I just
[2:42:53] can't hardly stand it when I pass
[2:42:55] somebody in a wheelchair I just can't
[2:42:57] hardly stand it such and such and such
[2:42:59] of course of course in our heart we want
[2:43:03] to see everybody healed perhaps Jesus
[2:43:06] would have loved to have seen everybody
[2:43:07] heal but everything he did in his
[2:43:10] Earthly Ministry was given to him as
[2:43:13] vision from the father he couldn't do
[2:43:15] one thing more than what the father
[2:43:17] commissioned him to do or one thing less
[2:43:20] and there is a little bride on the earth
[2:43:23] that's bound to the same Ministry
[2:43:27] it's only what the Lord reveals to us
[2:43:31] to do
[2:43:33] for instance the Lord dealt with me
[2:43:35] pretty seriously
[2:43:38] about not taking on the social justice
[2:43:40] Gospel of the modern Church
[2:43:44] he warned me specifically about the
[2:43:46] doctrine of the seven mountains and he
[2:43:48] warned me specifically about the social
[2:43:51] justice Gospel of the church
[2:43:54] there are plenty of churches and plenty
[2:43:56] of Ministries who can Herald the message
[2:43:59] of social justice
[2:44:01] but you and I are called only to do
[2:44:07] not to feed the whole world
[2:44:09] not to heal the whole world
[2:44:11] not to minister to the whole world but
[2:44:14] to minister to the ones that God sends
[2:44:17] us to to meet the needs of those that
[2:44:20] God sends us to now that may sound
[2:44:23] limiting but it's actually bigger than
[2:44:25] our imagination because we haven't even
[2:44:28] began to discover what God has for us in
[2:44:31] the great last great last Quick short
[2:44:34] demonstration
[2:44:36] of his authority in the bride
[2:44:40] brother Branham said she's going to have
[2:44:41] that bride thus saith the Lord or she's
[2:44:45] going to what
[2:44:46] she's going to keep still
[2:44:49] she's not just going to go running
[2:44:50] through them all trying to do something
[2:44:52] to every person that she sees this is
[2:44:55] not going to go over so well with some
[2:44:57] streamers
[2:45:00] of the spirit
[2:45:03] nothing wrong with that
[2:45:05] in fact the Bible said as many as are
[2:45:08] led by the spirit they are
[2:45:11] they are the sons of God
[2:45:14] then according to his own words his
[2:45:16] ministry was based upon Visions from his
[2:45:19] father
[2:45:21] so then Jesus spent the next 30 plus
[2:45:23] years of his life
[2:45:27] fulfilling
[2:45:28] what had meant 30 plus what had been
[2:45:31] written in his book
[2:45:37] that real Ministry of Jesus didn't begin
[2:45:39] until his baptism
[2:45:43] I know the a lot of times the movies
[2:45:45] have him healing
[2:45:47] children in the playpens where he lay
[2:45:50] or making the little clay pigeon
[2:45:54] come to life like the Jesus movie that
[2:45:56] went all around the world but we have no
[2:45:58] reason to believe in the Bible that he
[2:46:00] had any out of the ordinary experiences
[2:46:03] other than what's mentioned in the
[2:46:05] scripture and that was the wisdom that
[2:46:07] God had already placed in him baffled
[2:46:09] the teachers of the law the Bible
[2:46:11] records his first miracle as as being at
[2:46:14] the marriage of Cana where he spoke and
[2:46:16] created wine from water saving the best
[2:46:20] for last I believe that's prophetic of
[2:46:22] the day we're living in Saving The Best
[2:46:24] For Last anybody with me and we don't
[2:46:27] have any reason to believe his Earthly
[2:46:28] Ministry started until he stood in the
[2:46:31] in the Jordan River and his cousins
[2:46:34] proclaimed Behold the Lamb of God which
[2:46:37] taketh away the sin to the world and a
[2:46:39] voice spoke out of the heavenlies and
[2:46:41] said this is my beloved Son the best
[2:46:44] translation of that verse is this this
[2:46:46] is my beloved Son in whom I am pleased
[2:46:48] to dwell
[2:46:49] it pleases me to dwell in him
[2:46:54] and that was it
[2:46:56] from that moment on Jesus goes performs
[2:46:58] his first miracle ministers three and a
[2:47:00] half years on the Earth
[2:47:03] just before he finishes the last phase
[2:47:06] of ministry he's on top of Mount Hermon
[2:47:08] with his inner circle
[2:47:11] he is transfigured before them that word
[2:47:14] tells us that his skin glistened like
[2:47:18] gold
[2:47:20] that to look at him would have been
[2:47:22] looking at a golden man of light
[2:47:25] because even the pores of his physical
[2:47:28] body were transfigured into Divine Light
[2:47:31] I'm telling you that's powerful
[2:47:34] you just let a little bit of that light
[2:47:35] shine in the Dark World it'll go a long
[2:47:37] way
[2:47:38] don't need it all just a little of that
[2:47:40] to shine and make a difference
[2:47:42] we sometimes hear the the apostles
[2:47:44] rebuke even brother Branham corrects
[2:47:47] them a little bit there
[2:47:48] and says isn't that just like the
[2:47:50] denominational-minded people everybody
[2:47:52] wanting to build a church
[2:47:55] but it takes somebody like me Born To Be
[2:47:58] A worshiper
[2:47:59] to read that and see the other side no
[2:48:02] no dispute I believe exactly what
[2:48:04] brother random said there were those who
[2:48:06] had that mentality let's build a church
[2:48:08] let's make a denomination let's let's
[2:48:10] divide the body
[2:48:12] but as a worshiper as someone who is not
[2:48:14] born to be the messenger of the seven
[2:48:16] Angel but born rather to be a worshiper
[2:48:18] when I read that I I relate to the part
[2:48:21] that says we don't ever want to leave
[2:48:22] this place
[2:48:25] let's build us a place so we don't ever
[2:48:27] have to leave this presence let us stay
[2:48:29] right but here where the glory is
[2:48:33] don't want to go nowhere else
[2:48:35] but how many of you know that's not
[2:48:37] practical either
[2:48:38] the musicians are coming that's not
[2:48:40] practical either because there's a world
[2:48:42] that's got to see the light
[2:48:44] then there was a voice that spoke Out of
[2:48:46] Heaven that day and it said this is my
[2:48:48] beloved Son
[2:48:53] and those next three words are some of
[2:48:56] the most significant words ever spoken
[2:48:58] of the father over his son
[2:49:00] and what do those words say
[2:49:03] hear ye him
[2:49:07] this was his full adoption
[2:49:10] started at the Jordan River
[2:49:12] it ended at the Mount of transfiguration
[2:49:15] Mount Hermon
[2:49:18] I mentioned to you Tuesday night her
[2:49:20] soul goal
[2:49:21] that
[2:49:23] at the bottom of Mount Hermon is is
[2:49:25] Banya caesarea Philippi where all of
[2:49:28] those false gods are being worshiped
[2:49:30] even Caesar had a temple there in Pan
[2:49:33] the flute playing dancing goat is
[2:49:35] worshiped there and several others and
[2:49:38] Jesus is walking along there with his
[2:49:40] disciples and in the midst of all that
[2:49:42] Pagan worship he says who do you Fellers
[2:49:44] think I am
[2:49:47] they say well you're the Messiah some
[2:49:49] say you're Elias some say you're Elias
[2:49:52] some say you're John the Baptist or one
[2:49:54] of the prophets they believed in
[2:49:55] reincarnation or something there didn't
[2:49:57] they
[2:49:58] some kind of Resurrection something
[2:50:00] secret Resurrection while they would
[2:50:02] have made good message Believers there's
[2:50:04] some some of them that believe in secret
[2:50:06] resurrections don't they intent
[2:50:08] Ministries and
[2:50:10] return Ministries and all kinds of
[2:50:12] things like that
[2:50:14] ouch
[2:50:16] some say thou art Elias or John the
[2:50:18] Baptist or one of the prophets he said
[2:50:20] who do you say that I the son of man I
[2:50:22] am and Peter Peter laughs
[2:50:31] he ain't very tall
[2:50:34] but he's got arms
[2:50:39] Peter
[2:50:41] why why why why why not
[2:50:45] why not why not go through loss
[2:50:51] the Catholic Church tells us he was
[2:50:53] never married
[2:50:55] can anybody in this room tell me why any
[2:50:58] man in his rightful mind would choose to
[2:51:01] have a mother-in-law
[2:51:03] and not be married
[2:51:13] and I had a wonderful one
[2:51:18] my wife gave me a whole lot sweeter
[2:51:21] Kinder mother-in-law than I gave her
[2:51:27] my mother-in-law didn't make my way hard
[2:51:30] she believed in my Ministry
[2:51:33] she Faithfully supported our life
[2:51:35] together
[2:51:37] but why would any the Bible says that
[2:51:40] his mother-in-law was sick with a fever
[2:51:42] and yet the Catholic Church says he was
[2:51:44] never married
[2:51:45] why because they want to stuff him into
[2:51:47] being a pope
[2:51:49] no such thing
[2:51:55] Jesus said Thou Art Peter
[2:51:59] cephas
[2:52:04] blessed art thou
[2:52:06] Simon
[2:52:08] barjona son of Jonas
[2:52:12] for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it
[2:52:14] unto thee why because Peter said yeah
[2:52:17] some say you're John some say your lies
[2:52:19] yeah some say that Peter who do you say
[2:52:21] I the son of man am
[2:52:23] Thou Art the Messiah
[2:52:25] Thou Art the mashiach Thou Art the
[2:52:28] Christ the son of the Living God Jesus
[2:52:31] turns around right the whole time
[2:52:33] they're going in and out with their
[2:52:34] sacrifices to dance and goat gods and
[2:52:36] all kinds of pagan religions there come
[2:52:39] on
[2:52:40] right there with their Valentine's candy
[2:52:42] and their Christmas trees and all their
[2:52:49] all these message churches with their
[2:52:51] Valentine's Banquets and sweetheart
[2:52:53] Banquets this weekend I don't have time
[2:52:55] for that
[2:53:02] Thou Art the Christ
[2:53:05] the son of the Living God
[2:53:08] you don't understand folks unless you
[2:53:10] understand the mentality of the Jews in
[2:53:13] the second temple period nobody believed
[2:53:18] that that the Messiah would be the son
[2:53:21] of God
[2:53:22] the Jewish people did not believe in the
[2:53:26] second temple period that when Messiah
[2:53:28] came he would be the Son of God they
[2:53:31] believed he would be a god-gifted
[2:53:33] military man
[2:53:37] they believed that he would come and
[2:53:39] physically deliver them from the
[2:53:40] occupation of the Romans and they
[2:53:42] believed that he would be a righteous
[2:53:43] man in all of his ways but they did not
[2:53:46] teach no no synagogue was teaching no
[2:53:49] Jewish scholar was teaching that there
[2:53:52] would be a messiah who would be God man
[2:53:56] but little Peter
[2:54:02] you remember him
[2:54:06] you're not taking my Lord anywhere
[2:54:10] pulled his sword out and chopped the
[2:54:14] ears servant's ears
[2:54:21] if you and I would have been there we'd
[2:54:23] have been saying go Peter go
[2:54:31] peace looks over Peter
[2:54:33] this isn't the way it's done
[2:54:37] and like he has done for me a thousand
[2:54:40] times and for you a thousand times he
[2:54:44] just Stoops over and fixes Peter's mess
[2:54:51] Lord I want to thank you for every time
[2:54:53] you've put the ear back on
[2:54:56] I want to thank you for every time you
[2:54:58] fix my messes Lord when I did the
[2:55:01] dumbest things and you came in and fixed
[2:55:04] my mess
[2:55:05] Jesus just reached over and put the
[2:55:07] servant's ear back on slapped it right
[2:55:10] back on his head this is not the way
[2:55:12] it's done
[2:55:13] aren't you glad he's always there to
[2:55:16] cover for us
[2:55:19] Peter that that that Reed blown in the
[2:55:22] Wind
[2:55:25] they talk about Peter and they say oh he
[2:55:28] was the Rock of Gibraltar where he
[2:55:30] didn't start out the Rock of Gibraltar
[2:55:33] he started out like a little rolling
[2:55:35] piece of gravel pea gravel
[2:55:39] that word Petros that word that's there
[2:55:42] means a small Stone
[2:55:46] thou art a small Stone Peter you're a
[2:55:49] rolling piece of gravel
[2:55:51] but when I get through with you the
[2:55:52] whole church is going to hang on the
[2:55:54] truth that God just revealed to you in
[2:55:56] my presence Thou Art the Christ the son
[2:55:59] of the Living God and Jesus said blessed
[2:56:01] art thou Simon barjona for flesh and
[2:56:03] blood and church Seminary
[2:56:07] has not revealed it unto you but my
[2:56:10] Father which is in heaven Thou Art Peter
[2:56:15] and Upon This Rock
[2:56:18] not Petros not Peter
[2:56:21] this rock is not referring to the PO the
[2:56:24] little Rolling Stone
[2:56:26] this rock is is referring to the
[2:56:30] Revelation that Jesus Christ is the son
[2:56:33] of the Living God
[2:56:34] Upon This Rock I will build my church
[2:56:37] and the gates of hell it didn't say they
[2:56:39] wouldn't come against wouldn't March
[2:56:41] against wouldn't try to put it out
[2:56:43] it said and the Gates of Hell shall not
[2:56:46] Prevail against it how many of you want
[2:56:50] to praise the Lord for what he's done
[2:56:54] Hallelujah
[2:56:56] Hallelujah
[2:56:58] Hallelujah
[2:57:00] what a blessed people we are
[2:57:03] to know that if we can just keep
[2:57:05] surrendering to the book
[2:57:09] we are indeed a people of the book
[2:57:12] and it is our calling to keep
[2:57:15] surrendering to the book that the Lord
[2:57:16] has written about our lives
[2:57:19] You Don't Have To Fear
[2:57:22] death itself in fact you don't have to
[2:57:24] fear disease you don't have to fear the
[2:57:27] problems that the enemy sends to take
[2:57:29] you out because the grace of God is
[2:57:32] sufficient in all cases and one of these
[2:57:35] days when it's time for you to leave
[2:57:37] you're leaving
[2:57:39] you could leave in the finest hospital
[2:57:41] with the best doctor taking the best
[2:57:43] medicine
[2:57:45] but one day when the Lord calls us home
[2:57:47] we're leaving here hallelujah I'm not
[2:57:50] looking for the first boat load out but
[2:57:53] I don't want to be here one day longer
[2:57:55] than he wants me here I want to be here
[2:57:58] as long as it takes to fulfill
[2:58:00] everything my father has written about
[2:58:03] me
[2:58:04] one of the reasons why I need this time
[2:58:07] away
[2:58:09] it's because I want to have an
[2:58:11] opportunity without without pressure
[2:58:14] to reevaluate
[2:58:16] and I want to make sure that I discover
[2:58:18] I don't have to have the next five years
[2:58:21] outlined for me
[2:58:23] but I need to know that the next few
[2:58:25] months I can discover what God's perfect
[2:58:28] plan is for my life and Ministry I
[2:58:33] cannot afford to miss one page
[2:58:38] of my destiny book
[2:58:40] you my friend cannot afford to spend
[2:58:43] another night
[2:58:45] doing your own will
[2:58:47] your own way
[2:58:49] well this makes me feel good I don't
[2:58:52] care whether it makes you feel good or
[2:58:53] not if it's not God's perfect will for
[2:58:56] your life who do you love the most
[2:58:59] do you love yourself more or do you love
[2:59:01] his will more well I tell you what his
[2:59:04] bride loves him more the enemy will kind
[2:59:06] of delude you and confuse you and make
[2:59:08] you not know the difference between the
[2:59:10] two
[2:59:11] you can break out of that today and
[2:59:13] commit your life to him and say Lord I
[2:59:15] don't want to live another day not
[2:59:16] another day until I know I don't have to
[2:59:19] know don't be greedy
[2:59:21] you don't have to know the next chapter
[2:59:24] you don't have to get out and start
[2:59:26] telling God God I want you to show me
[2:59:28] the next five years of my life
[2:59:31] why
[2:59:33] all you need to know is what God would
[2:59:35] have you to do today
[2:59:41] when you get up tomorrow you need to
[2:59:42] know what God would have you do tomorrow
[2:59:44] and I'm going to tell you something
[2:59:46] I'm closing I know I've taken time you
[2:59:49] you will you will not have to hear me
[2:59:51] now for a couple of weeks
[2:59:53] I told these fellas
[2:59:56] over in this direction over here
[2:59:58] the brisket Kings
[3:00:02] I told them the other night when I was
[3:00:04] sitting there with with Josh and charity
[3:00:07] and I said
[3:00:09] sometimes I look at my hand
[3:00:12] and I say where did my hand go
[3:00:17] I know you're quiet
[3:00:21] I'm glad that you're also Young
[3:00:23] that it ain't struck you yet
[3:00:26] but all of a sudden one day I looked at
[3:00:28] my hand and I said where did that hand
[3:00:29] come from
[3:00:31] that's not the hand I used to have
[3:00:36] it didn't used to look like that
[3:00:39] anybody caught me yet
[3:00:41] it don't look like it used to look
[3:00:44] s like the skin is a little thinner and
[3:00:47] I can see the pores
[3:00:49] and why do hands have to wrinkle
[3:00:56] what's that is that supposed to is that
[3:00:58] there to teach me humility and
[3:01:06] it's life
[3:01:09] it's 54 years of change
[3:01:12] sister Flo's pointing at her cheeks
[3:01:15] you look brilliant radiant and young to
[3:01:18] me
[3:01:22] I don't care in the sense that it's
[3:01:25] supposed to happen I want to know when
[3:01:27] it happened
[3:01:31] I don't ever remember a time of looking
[3:01:33] down and saying hey
[3:01:35] my hand is aging
[3:01:38] I just looked down one day and it had
[3:01:42] and I don't want to miss that time in
[3:01:43] between
[3:01:47] so I've been spending some time already
[3:01:49] Lord
[3:01:51] I don't want to waste a minute
[3:01:56] of my life
[3:01:58] I want to be doing what you would have
[3:02:01] me to do with who you would have me to
[3:02:03] do it
[3:02:06] I don't have time to hang out with
[3:02:08] somebody bad for me
[3:02:13] I need to be hanging out with somebody
[3:02:15] that I can help
[3:02:17] or might be helping me some along the
[3:02:19] way come on
[3:02:21] I don't have time to be stuck in a in a
[3:02:24] place where I don't want to be in a
[3:02:26] position that I don't want to be in but
[3:02:28] I realize at least for me I I'm I'm
[3:02:31] approaching those years where where you
[3:02:34] should be reflective
[3:02:37] and I don't want there to be one
[3:02:40] sentence
[3:02:41] in my book unfulfilled because I chose
[3:02:45] my own way
[3:02:47] instead of his way
[3:02:49] I don't want to get to heaven and find
[3:02:51] one thing that was mine that I didn't
[3:02:53] utilize here on the Earth
[3:02:56] and I encourage you whether you're 55
[3:02:59] like I'm soon to be
[3:03:01] or whether you're 15.
[3:03:04] I encourage you to take the same
[3:03:06] attitude toward the rest of your life
[3:03:09] and the rest of your life begins now
[3:03:12] and say Lord I'm going to walk carefully
[3:03:15] and Tenderly and softly before you
[3:03:19] I want my decisions to be led and I want
[3:03:23] my time to be well spent and I want it
[3:03:27] to matter
[3:03:28] I don't want to spend moments wasted
[3:03:32] with games and fun and Frills and I
[3:03:35] don't mean
[3:03:36] that I don't want to relax
[3:03:40] but I don't want to spend time relaxing
[3:03:43] that I need to be working
[3:03:46] you understand
[3:03:47] and I don't want to be doing work for
[3:03:49] the sake of doing work
[3:03:52] have you ever caught yourself
[3:03:54] working to work
[3:03:59] I want to work when it's time to work
[3:04:01] and rest when it's time to rest
[3:04:04] let's stand
[3:04:06] it's all written down lord if you'll
[3:04:08] just help us Discover it
[3:04:10] it's all written down
[3:04:13] Hallelujah
[3:04:15] I want to give a little
[3:04:17] altar call this morning
[3:04:20] in the sense that
[3:04:23] I want you to
[3:04:25] be reflective with me I've I've tried to
[3:04:28] take a different tone
[3:04:30] even in my preaching today
[3:04:33] to be calm and deliberate
[3:04:36] because I want us to seize this
[3:04:40] opportunity
[3:04:42] to say Lord why am I here why am I still
[3:04:44] here
[3:04:45] what is my destiny
[3:04:48] what would you have me to do
[3:04:51] what can I do
[3:04:54] I I don't want to I don't want to come
[3:04:56] here and and try to figure out what
[3:04:58] everybody else can do for me
[3:05:02] I want to figure out what I can do for
[3:05:04] somebody
[3:05:08] I want to be in the center of God's will
[3:05:12] no matter what the cost and I want to
[3:05:14] invite those of you if you'll just tell
[3:05:16] them what you're going to sing so they
[3:05:17] can play it for a moment
[3:05:19] I would like to ask any of you that
[3:05:22] would say brother I get it I get it I
[3:05:24] get it
[3:05:26] if you think I'm going through some kind
[3:05:28] of midlife crisis I'm not
[3:05:31] I'm going through a moment of I want to
[3:05:33] know that I know that I know that I know
[3:05:35] that I know and I'll tell you more than
[3:05:36] anything else I want to know that I
[3:05:38] value and spend time
[3:05:41] with my head on his chest
[3:05:43] if I ever get so busy
[3:05:46] that I can't lay my head on his chest
[3:05:49] and hear his heartbeat
[3:05:51] I don't I don't want to be that busy

[3:13:42] pray with me right now Father Here We
[3:13:44] Are
[3:13:46] we learn again today where our minds
[3:13:49] have been reminded we've been renewed
[3:13:51] and refreshed
[3:13:53] in understanding that all of our days
[3:13:57] are written in your book
[3:14:01] and every thought that you would have
[3:14:03] about us
[3:14:05] was already recorded in your book before
[3:14:07] we were ever born
[3:14:10] Lord we don't want to spend the rest of
[3:14:13] our life not even an afternoon
[3:14:16] doing something that's not written
[3:14:20] in your perfect plan for Who We Are
[3:14:24] we wanna we don't want to do something
[3:14:26] because circumstances have come into
[3:14:28] alignment
[3:14:30] and it looks convenient and it seems
[3:14:33] right
[3:14:34] but we want to know Lord that everything
[3:14:36] we do now is according to your great big
[3:14:40] divine plan
[3:14:42] and I know that when we think this we're
[3:14:44] thinking about preachers we're thinking
[3:14:46] about ministers but Lord
[3:14:49] you want us as a people as a body as
[3:14:52] sons of God
[3:14:53] to think about our own lives in this
[3:14:56] manner
[3:14:57] mothers
[3:14:59] fathers
[3:15:01] sisters brothers
[3:15:03] young people
[3:15:05] senior citizens
[3:15:08] who may feel like they have lived out
[3:15:11] the most of their life
[3:15:13] in physical conditions have dictated a
[3:15:17] slower Pace that's all right
[3:15:20] you saw it
[3:15:22] you knew it
[3:15:24] it did not catch you by surprise
[3:15:28] so whatever our station in life is right
[3:15:30] now as a body
[3:15:33] we just want to come back and say Lord
[3:15:35] we surrender
[3:15:38] to every page
[3:15:40] to every thought
[3:15:42] to every desire that you have for our
[3:15:46] lives would you tell him right now
[3:15:49] I can only tell him corporately for us
[3:15:52] but will you tell him individually Lord

[3:15:58] I don't have to know the next chapter
[3:16:01] I don't have to have all the answers now
[3:16:05] but I need to know what you would have
[3:16:07] me doing now
[3:16:09] I don't want to waste even an afternoon
[3:16:14] I want to be where you would have me to
[3:16:16] be doing what you would have me to do
[3:16:18] reaching out to who you would have me to
[3:16:21] reach out to
[3:16:23] growing in whatever way you would have
[3:16:25] me to grow ministering in whatever way
[3:16:28] you would have me to minister
[3:16:31] I don't want to minister to the world
[3:16:33] and miss the opportunity to minister to
[3:16:35] my own family Lord let me be sensitive
[3:16:38] why don't you ask him Lord let me be
[3:16:41] sensitive to the needs even of my own
