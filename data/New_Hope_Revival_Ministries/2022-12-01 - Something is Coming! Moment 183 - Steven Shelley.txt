Description:
Something is coming!  Something that has been prophesied a generation ago, something we have been praying and looking for, is coming corporately as well as in our personal lives. 

Something we have tried to come into in our own power, but it was not in the right season.  That problem we have tried to overcome, the wall we couldn’t climb over, is about to come down in our lives if we are willing to step up and claim His promise as ours, if we stay in step with the Holy Ghost and God’s Word.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] the impossibility that has held back the potential in your life and your walk with God it's about to become possible if you will step up and take what's yours [Music] it's no big prophetic thing to say change is on the way because change is always on the way God is not satisfied leaving us the way we he found us very little stays the same in this life it's not necessarily change that we don't like in fact some of us often cry out to God for change let me see your hand if you find yourself crying out to God for change so it's not change that you fear most of the time it's a dread and a fear of the unknown leaving behind the familiar can stress us not knowing what the next season will look like and how change will affect our lives our families our homes our jobs but I want to tell you in the name of the Lord the season that you are in right now is about to change [Music] incorporately but if you dare have faith you can change your personal season as well something's coming something we've been waiting on a long time something we've been praying for something that was prophesied a generation ago and you better be ready when it gets here something you're trying to do before but couldn't do in your own power something that you've been racking your brain over something that you've been praying about a wall that you couldn't get over in the past a situation that you've not been able to change no matter how hard you've tried the problem that just won't go away the impossibility that has held back the potential in your life and your walk with God it's about to become possible if you will step up and take what's yours it's a new season maybe you've been trying to get a suntan in the midst of winter maybe you've been trying to shovel snow in the middle of the summer then you're in the wrong season you've been working too hard at something that wasn't in God's timing maybe you're doing the right labor but in the wrong season you must stay in step with the Holy Ghost you must stay in step with the word you must stay in step with the spirit the spirit will keep you in the right season of the Lord no wonder we get discouraged when we're working so hard but we see such little result if you are doing all you know to do and you are seeing no fruit there is a reason for that you need to now ask yourself am I doing all the right things but in the wrong season because if you'll just wait for the season to change and go right back into doing all the right things that you know to do in the right season God will give you the Harvest that you're after
