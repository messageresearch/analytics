[0:02] [Music]
[0:09] will you live the Jesus life the
[0:12] Ascended life the supernatural life from
[0:15] the realm of the Spirit
[0:24] but I've got good news for you and that
[0:27] is God by nature is a redeemer
[0:30] [Music]
[0:36] is surrendering our mind to the word
[0:39] that's what makes the big difference
[0:41] that's the great mystery right Christ in
[0:43] you the hope a lord
[1:00] hello and welcome to the program today
[1:03] I'm pastor Stephen Shelley of New Hope
[1:06] revival ministries and I'm coming to you
[1:09] today in partnership with the gospel
[1:12] channel brother Eric Erickson and all of
[1:15] the fine staff at the gospel channel
[1:17] we're working together to bring you some
[1:20] programming hopefully that will
[1:22] encourage you and strengthen you on your
[1:26] journey and we're thankful to God for
[1:28] the opportunity to do so
[1:30] we appreciate very very much your
[1:33] correspondence being able to hear from
[1:35] you by email or by phone call and those
[1:40] of you who have also called at a
[1:43] different time we're in a different time
[1:45] zone and so you just graciously left
[1:48] your prayer request on the machine and
[1:51] as I mentioned before a sister will
[1:53] transcribe that and we print it off and
[1:56] immediately it becomes a matter of
[1:58] Prayer for not just myself but for many
[2:02] of us in fact in our services here at
[2:05] our local church we hold up the folder
[2:08] and we pray also for your needs we
[2:12] believe in the power of prayer and we
[2:15] believe in faith having faith in God and
[2:17] we know that faith in God can move
[2:20] mighty mountains in all of our lives and
[2:24] so we thank you and I think I should say
[2:28] that several of you have have given you
[2:31] have sown some seed into the ministry
[2:34] and although we we've not asked for
[2:37] support for ourselves we definitely want
[2:40] you to support the gospel channel in
[2:42] prayer and in your financial giving but
[2:45] to those of you who felt impressed of
[2:47] the Lord to help us it is a great
[2:49] blessing to us we have a large vision
[2:53] and we are totally depending on the Lord
[2:56] to provide for that vision we've had
[2:59] some opportunities arise and we are
[3:02] invited to be on other networks and all
[3:05] of this is in the hands of the Lord it
[3:08] would
[3:08] by the grace of God if that were
[3:11] possible and if he opens that door and
[3:14] makes the way then we would just welcome
[3:16] it we would be excited but thank you for
[3:19] being in touch with us and don't forget
[3:22] to let us know when God is moving and
[3:26] when you see answered prayer then also
[3:30] pass that along to us and we'll rejoice
[3:33] with you at the goodness of God this is
[3:36] number eight this is part eight in a
[3:40] series that we have entitled schemes and
[3:44] devices it is not the will of God that
[3:47] we should be ignorant concerning the
[3:50] devices that the enemy uses against the
[3:53] body of Christ in this hour when we
[3:57] ended broadcast number seven in this
[4:00] series we were reading in the amplified
[4:04] bible Ephesians chapter six and we
[4:07] already read it and shared it in the
[4:10] King James and we were breaking it down
[4:13] and I'd like to go back to where we were
[4:15] and finish that up and then move forward
[4:18] in the series in verse 13 therefore put
[4:24] on God's complete armor that you may be
[4:28] able to resist and stand your ground on
[4:32] the evil day of danger and having done
[4:36] all the crisis demands to stand firmly
[4:41] in your place stand therefore hold your
[4:45] ground
[4:46] having tightened the belt of truth
[4:48] around your loins and having put on the
[4:52] breastplate of integrity and of moral
[4:56] rectitude and right standing with God
[5:00] and that's about where we were ending
[5:02] the King James Version translates that
[5:06] breastplate of righteousness and we were
[5:10] teaching that it is not entirely our
[5:15] moral high standing or our righteousness
[5:19] that
[5:20] that really provides the breastplate of
[5:24] protection but it is his righteousness
[5:28] we become the out working the going
[5:33] forth of his righteousness and I gave
[5:37] you an example of a couple times in my
[5:40] life I didn't go into the detail but I
[5:44] shared with you that there were some
[5:46] times that I was faced with a big
[5:49] decision and I was tempted to choose a
[5:54] little bit less than then really what
[5:58] God's best was for me if I would have
[6:02] made the choice then there would have
[6:04] been more finances there would have been
[6:05] more promotion it would have been you
[6:09] know a socially better choice we could
[6:11] say and yet I knew somewhere in my heart
[6:17] that that was not the best that God had
[6:20] for me and but I found it difficult to
[6:24] make that decision
[6:25] it just bogged me down I hope you
[6:28] understand my expressions and it was in
[6:31] that moment that I realized that I did
[6:34] not have in myself the strength to make
[6:38] the right choice I needed to let the
[6:41] Lord know I need your righteousness I
[6:45] need your integrity I need to know that
[6:49] I am working with you that I that I have
[6:53] you in my life strengthening me to make
[6:57] the right decision that breastplate is
[7:00] an important part of the armor it
[7:02] protects those vital organs we mentioned
[7:05] the lungs and the heart and so it's very
[7:09] important that in the spiritual battle
[7:11] of the Christian journey that we are
[7:14] protected that our entire body both
[7:17] physically and spiritually is protected
[7:20] against the wiles of the enemy and and
[7:23] hasn't God been so good to provide a
[7:27] portion of armor to protect us in every
[7:33] way imaginable and given us the weapons
[7:37] that we need to move forward in this in
[7:40] this great battle
[7:41] verse 15 said and having shod your feet
[7:45] in preparation to face the enemy with
[7:50] the firm footed stability and promptness
[7:55] and the readiness produced by the good
[7:58] news of the gospel of peace the King
[8:02] James Version just says having your feet
[8:05] shod with the preparation of peace but I
[8:08] like the way the amplified carries it
[8:10] forward and having shod your feet in
[8:13] preparation to face the enemy firm
[8:16] footed in firm footed stability the
[8:21] promptness and the readiness produced by
[8:25] the good news of the gospel of peace he
[8:29] has us covered and then verse 16 lifts
[8:33] up over all the covering Shield of
[8:38] saving faith upon which you can quench
[8:42] all the flaming missiles of the wicked
[8:47] one
[8:47] that's the shield of faith above all
[8:51] being lifted up a covering to quench all
[8:56] of the fiery darts or missiles of the
[9:00] wicked one and verse 17 and take the
[9:03] helmet of salvation and the sword the
[9:09] spirit wheels which is the Word of God
[9:14] the sword that the spirit wheels I like
[9:18] that I like the way that's translated
[9:22] it's the sword of the Spirit but it's
[9:25] the sword that the Spirit uses in
[9:29] warfare and what is the sword it's
[9:33] defined for us which is the Word of God
[9:36] or I don't know if you're catching that
[9:39] or not but the Word of God in the hand
[9:43] the spirit becomes the most effective
[9:48] sword the most effective weapon against
[9:52] the enemy I'm so thankful that the Word
[9:56] of God when used by the spirit you know
[10:01] the Bible says and we have spoken about
[10:04] it here on this program the letter
[10:06] killeth but the spirit make it alive you
[10:10] can take the printed letter of God's
[10:13] Word and use it for all sort of selfish
[10:17] purposes and use it to bring more death
[10:21] and anything else but when the Spirit of
[10:24] God uses the word when the when that
[10:28] anointing and that inspiration and that
[10:31] oil of the Spirit begins to pick up the
[10:35] word and use it for the purposes of God
[10:38] I'm telling you there's just no stopping
[10:41] the sword of the Lord the sword of the
[10:44] Spirit which is the word of God when we
[10:47] use the sword of the Spirit it often is
[10:50] working at levels that you and I as
[10:54] soldiers cannot see and and what that
[10:57] means is because the Word of God handled
[11:01] by the Spirit is a living entity it
[11:05] there's life in the word when the spirit
[11:10] picks it up or takes it up as you would
[11:13] hold a sword in your hand when the
[11:16] Spirit handles the Word of God I hope
[11:20] I'm not confusing you because it's
[11:22] really a beautiful picture when the
[11:25] Spirit takes up the sword of the word
[11:28] I'm telling you much can be accomplished
[11:31] but sometimes it's not all out in the
[11:34] open sometimes the spirit uses the word
[11:39] of God in ways that we cannot readily
[11:44] detect with the natural eye because this
[11:48] is not a natural Wharf
[11:50] this is not a battle of the flesh as we
[11:54] have spoken often but it's a spiritual
[11:56] battle that can only be won with
[12:00] spiritual weapons and spiritual tools if
[12:03] I should try to use the Word of God for
[12:07] my own purpose to argue to to condemn to
[12:12] force someone to see it my way
[12:15] I could be guilty of imparting death but
[12:20] if I should allow the Spirit of the Lord
[12:22] to take up the Word of God as a tool or
[12:26] as a weapon then I know whether I see it
[12:29] with my natural eye or not I know that
[12:33] God's perfect will is being accomplished
[12:36] if it's not manifested immediately in
[12:40] this natural realm then I know that
[12:43] something has shifted in the realm of
[12:46] the Spirit this is so important for you
[12:49] and I to learn to be sensitive and to
[12:53] recognize that just because we don't
[12:56] immediately see victory in the natural
[12:59] realm does not mean that nothing is
[13:03] being accomplished over there in the
[13:05] spirit realm
[13:06] I believe the victory is won in the
[13:08] spirit realm first and then it is
[13:12] actuated or carried out in the natural
[13:16] realm so just take courage and just
[13:20] believe that it's not what we see with
[13:24] our eye but it's knowing that God's Word
[13:28] is a mighty weapon in the natural a
[13:32] sword can only reach as far as the arm
[13:35] can extend you know that's the leaf if
[13:38] you know no matter how long the sword is
[13:41] you can you pick that up and and it can
[13:44] only go as far as the arm
[13:46] can carry it forward but I'm talking
[13:49] about a sword the sword of the Spirit
[13:53] which is the word of God I'm talking
[13:56] about a weapon that can go much
[13:59] Arthur by prayer it can go much farther
[14:03] with our faith attached to it it can
[14:06] accomplish many more things in in in
[14:10] battle we could say then what the arm
[14:13] can reach it - in other words prayer and
[14:17] spiritual warfare and praying against
[14:21] the works of the enemy using the word of
[14:23] God against our enemy it can have
[14:26] far-reaching effects on the other side
[14:28] of the world much farther than the
[14:31] physical arm could extend a physical
[14:34] sword so we have a better sword we have
[14:37] better weapons than what the natural
[14:39] soldier hand we have those spiritual
[14:42] weapons and while a sword in the natural
[14:46] would be limited in many ways the sword
[14:49] of the Spirit which is the word of God
[14:51] really knows no limitations when God's
[14:55] word is spoken decreed declared with the
[15:01] inspiration with the spirit holding it
[15:04] taking it up I'm telling you it goes far
[15:09] and it accomplishes what God's
[15:12] intentions are in a particular situation
[15:15] and this is what we know when God's Word
[15:19] is released by the Spirit when God's
[15:24] Word is sent forth by the Spirit it
[15:28] accomplishes everything that's in the
[15:31] heart and the mind of God and it always
[15:34] releases a spirit of increase when the
[15:38] word of God goes forth by the spirit it
[15:42] always releases a spirit and atmosphere
[15:46] of increase I'm thinking about a
[15:49] scripture in the book of Acts Acts the
[15:52] twelfth chapter and the 24th verse but
[15:56] the Word of God grew and multiplied now
[16:02] I know that there could be a natural
[16:06] understanding of this verse of scripture
[16:08] it could mean that the
[16:11] news of the gospel spread into further
[16:15] territory than it had ever spread before
[16:18] but I believe this verse is speaking not
[16:22] only of the natural going forth and
[16:25] spreading of the word but also of the
[16:29] spiritual increase that comes when the
[16:33] word is set forth by the spirit let me
[16:37] just make this a little practical we've
[16:41] read the Bible we read it oftentimes
[16:45] we've read it for years I've you know as
[16:50] many of you have I've disciplined myself
[16:54] through the years to read the Bible from
[16:57] cover to cover but I couldn't possibly
[17:00] think that by reading it from Genesis to
[17:04] Revelation that I would absorb or
[17:09] comprehend or understand all that is
[17:12] contained in the written record of God's
[17:15] Word I've had the Spirit of God to
[17:19] highlight certain portions certain books
[17:22] of the Bible a particular or verse in
[17:26] the Bible and make it real to me and I
[17:29] knew that I had read it over and over
[17:32] again and just got a few little layers
[17:34] of understanding but when the Spirit
[17:37] takes up the word when the spirit drops
[17:40] that revelation and inspiration on a
[17:43] verse or on a passage it becomes it
[17:47] almost takes on a new identity because
[17:50] it lives the spirit is what makes the
[17:54] written record of God's Word live and
[17:57] because of that there may be a
[18:01] particular situation in your life and
[18:04] you're praying and praying for Direction
[18:07] strategy Lord show me what to do I don't
[18:10] even know how to pray have you ever have
[18:13] you ever said that
[18:14] lord I don't even know how to pray all I
[18:18] know is this is a mess
[18:21] and sometimes what we have to say is not
[18:25] my will but your will be done your will
[18:27] be done on earth even as it is in heaven
[18:29] because there are times that we can't
[18:32] even really immediately discern what the
[18:35] will of God is in a particular situation
[18:38] but what is so powerful it's when by
[18:41] prayer seeking the Lord he will lead you
[18:47] that inner voice of God leads you to a
[18:50] particular passage of Scripture and then
[18:54] give you the inspiration to decree that
[18:57] word to declare that word now now in
[19:00] order to do that we're almost always
[19:03] using it a bit differently than its
[19:07] context for instance a verse that was
[19:10] written as a letter from the Apostle
[19:14] Paul to the church at Ephesus and yet
[19:17] we're taking this verse and using it in
[19:20] a personal way is that illegal
[19:23] absolutely not now to form doctrine or
[19:27] theology we can't take a verse of
[19:29] scripture out of its context
[19:31] and build a whole idea on it that's not
[19:35] what I'm encouraging you to do at all
[19:36] but but I'm saying it's so powerful when
[19:41] the Spirit of the Lord will take a verse
[19:43] of scripture highlight it to you by the
[19:45] spirit and then release some Authority
[19:49] for you to decree that word into your
[19:52] situation into into what you're facing
[19:56] and what I what I would say about that
[19:59] is that is the lord extending the reach
[20:02] of the sword that is God taking this
[20:05] verse of scripture extending its
[20:08] influence its authority in its power
[20:11] it's the Spirit of God using the word in
[20:15] our lives like a weapon you just decree
[20:18] and declare it when the enemy comes with
[20:20] his lies just let the Spirit of God lead
[20:23] you and direct you to a verse of
[20:26] scripture that you can use against the
[20:29] enemy it's always a good idea to speak
[20:32] the Word of God
[20:33] it's always a good idea and I tell you
[20:36] I've had to do it some time in
[20:38] situations when I didn't know what to
[20:40] pray really didn't know what to say and
[20:43] just pick up the Bible and read the Book
[20:45] of Psalms just let the Lord direct me
[20:48] and and and what happens in doing that
[20:51] is your reading the words of another
[20:53] man's prays to God but you start reading
[20:56] that aloud and guess what happens your
[20:58] spirit connects your spirit connects
[21:01] with the worship that was coming out of
[21:04] the psalmist David's overflow and and
[21:06] you become a part of that worship and
[21:09] you are saying to the Lord bless the
[21:12] Lord you're not you're not saying it as
[21:14] though you were David you know I'm David
[21:17] bless the Lord O David's soul bless the
[21:20] Lord oh no you you start identifying
[21:23] with it and you bless the Lord O my soul
[21:27] and all that is within me you might have
[21:32] the Lord direct you to the name of the
[21:35] Lord is a strong tower and the righteous
[21:39] run into it and are safe and you might
[21:41] start declaring that I will not live in
[21:44] fear I have a strong tower it is the
[21:47] name of the Lord I will run into that
[21:50] tower when I need refuge I will run into
[21:53] the name of the Lord when I need
[21:55] strength when I need healing when I need
[21:58] my hope restored so the Word of God
[22:01] becomes a beautiful guide for both
[22:04] prayer and for worship and the only way
[22:07] to discover that is to get in the book
[22:10] we have to get in the book and and when
[22:13] we do when the Spirit takes the word and
[22:16] extends its influence under inspiration
[22:20] then we can see that increase that comes
[22:24] it makes the Word of God a very present
[22:28] help a very present reality in our life
[22:31] and using the sword of the Spirit which
[22:34] is the word of God releases life into
[22:39] situations where only death has
[22:42] prevailed when the living
[22:44] word of God is used and that is the
[22:47] spirit using the word resurrection not
[22:51] only increase takes place but
[22:54] resurrection life becomes present it
[22:58] steps forward and death is left behind
[23:02] there may be situations that are dead
[23:05] hopeless absolutely hopeless if you had
[23:10] to figure it out you wouldn't even know
[23:12] how to begin but the Spirit of God can
[23:16] take the word make it a living reality
[23:19] in your prayer life and the next thing
[23:21] you know you see increase and you see
[23:24] resurrection we're ten minutes before
[23:28] when you were looking at it all you
[23:29] could see was death defeat hopelessness
[23:32] a dead end darkness and now you say my
[23:37] my the light of God is shining in that
[23:40] situation and guess what happens your
[23:42] faith becomes activated and your faith
[23:45] grows you know it's it's a daily this is
[23:48] a daily exercise it's something that we
[23:52] walk in we are walking in the spirit
[23:55] that means we're living in the spirit
[23:58] we're learning how to live less of a
[24:02] flesh driven life we're learning how to
[24:06] live less of an emotionally driven life
[24:09] or my own will driven life and we're
[24:13] learning more by the grace of God how to
[24:16] live a spirit life out of the
[24:21] resurrection life of Jesus Christ that
[24:24] resides that abides in the inner man of
[24:29] the believer powerful truth and it may
[24:33] seem simple to some it may seem
[24:35] complicated to some but remember we
[24:38] access it by faith whether it's too
[24:41] simple for you or too complicated for
[24:43] you you can walk in it anyway if you're
[24:46] willing to use your faith to exercise
[24:48] your faith in that in that direction
[24:51] death structures that we talked about
[24:53] earlier in this series
[24:55] death structures are pierced there
[24:59] they're sliced away when the word of God
[25:03] the sword of the Spirit which is the
[25:06] word of God is being used effectively it
[25:09] doesn't matter how strong look at
[25:13] generational curses and you've seen how
[25:16] certain strongholds have passed down in
[25:19] families from generation to generation
[25:23] don't you accept that as though you have
[25:27] no choice in the matter because the
[25:30] sword of the Spirit which is the word of
[25:33] God you place the Word of God in the
[25:36] hand of the Spirit and let him use the
[25:40] sword and when that happens I don't care
[25:43] how long the death structure has been in
[25:45] place life can penetrate the death light
[25:50] can penetrate the darkness blessed be
[25:53] the name of the Lord Psalm 129 hold on
[25:56] to this one some 129 and verse 4 the
[26:01] Lord is righteous he has cut in pieces
[26:07] the cords of the wicked
[26:10] nothing plotted against you by the
[26:13] wicked weather that's wicked men and
[26:16] women whether that's wickedness which is
[26:18] represented by spiritual wickedness in
[26:21] high places whether it's a natural
[26:24] attack you know it seems like that that
[26:27] wicked and ungodly people or after you
[26:31] remember there's a bigger warfare going
[26:35] on than that which appears to be flesh
[26:38] and blood but it doesn't matter how it's
[26:42] coming what matters is he has cut the
[26:46] cords of the wicked with his mighty
[26:50] sword so no matter what the enemy is
[26:53] plotting to use to paralyze you to
[26:56] imprison you it can be broken it must be
[27:02] broken and the power of agreement is
[27:06] enough your faith
[27:08] and my faith joining together right now
[27:11] that really activates the Spirit of the
[27:15] Lord to move into a situation and take
[27:18] this sword and cut every cord every
[27:23] chain that the enemy would use to bind
[27:26] you to bind your family
[27:28] there's victory there is absolute
[27:31] victory our sword our sword the sword of
[27:36] the Spirit which is the word of God is
[27:37] sharper than any curse any curse of
[27:42] witchcraft that the enemy would try to
[27:45] place on you generational curses or are
[27:50] just simply witchcraft curses
[27:53] incantations there there is a lot of
[27:57] that kind of thing going on in the hour
[27:59] that we're living in today there's
[28:01] witchcraft on multiple levels
[28:04] those who practice the dark arts who
[28:07] operate someone said I don't even
[28:09] believe in those things well I'm not
[28:11] here to try to convince you that they're
[28:13] real but I am here to say that a lot of
[28:17] people are feeling the influence of
[28:19] those of those darker kinds of curses
[28:22] and incantations and those those kinds
[28:26] of things it's the body of Christ is
[28:29] being bombarded with this kind of an
[28:31] attack that's why we need intercessors
[28:36] who can operate in in the discerning of
[28:40] spirits that's why we need men and women
[28:44] who can reach in and discover what's
[28:48] behind this but I want you to know that
[28:52] that fear becomes a breeding ground for
[28:55] the enemy so you must not respond to
[28:59] whatever you see or hear or feel with
[29:02] fear you've got to answer it all no
[29:05] matter how dark it is you've got to
[29:07] answer it all with faith your sword the
[29:11] sword of the Spirit which is the word of
[29:14] God is stronger than any kind of curse
[29:18] any kind of encase
[29:20] pation that the enemy would speak
[29:23] against your life I don't care you know
[29:25] I'll just speak plain I don't care how
[29:28] high-ranking the witch is because this
[29:32] is often the case there are those who
[29:35] proudly call themselves witches and
[29:39] that's not those that we remember from
[29:42] cartoons with black cats and pointed
[29:45] hats and flying on a broom it's often
[29:49] times people who look just like you and
[29:51] I who have been looking for another
[29:54] source of power been looking for another
[29:57] sense of fulfillment and they have
[29:59] turned from truth from Jesus Christ who
[30:03] is the only truth and they have accepted
[30:06] the counterfeit the impostor the I'm
[30:10] telling you if you're operating in that
[30:13] kind of a power you're operating in
[30:16] counterfeit power you're operating in a
[30:19] legal authority and if you as a believer
[30:22] in Jesus Christ are in pharr are feeling
[30:25] the influence or you're being attacked
[30:27] by something from that dark side you've
[30:30] got the weapon oh yes
[30:32] you've got the weapon I keep saying it
[30:36] over and over again the sword of the
[30:37] Spirit which is the word of God you let
[30:41] the spirit take up the word on your
[30:43] behalf I mean you you can read the
[30:45] scripture just just by your own
[30:47] knowledge of the word do it but when the
[30:51] Spirit of God begins to fight on your
[30:53] behalf using this sword as we are told
[30:57] it's a gift given to us when that begins
[31:00] to take place I don't care where the
[31:02] wickedness is coming from where the
[31:04] curse is coming from it has to be broken
[31:06] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[31:09] many curses are sent without a cause and
[31:12] we send them right back to the enemy and
[31:15] the authority of Jesus Christ we refuse
[31:18] them and we send them back we just we
[31:21] pray against unholy alliances we can
[31:25] come against those kinds of things in
[31:27] the authority of Jesus Christ every
[31:29] death structure must bow to his
[31:32] authority
[31:33] every spirit of death must bow to the
[31:36] authority of Jesus Christ every spirit
[31:39] of poverty and sickness and disease
[31:41] every every jealous spirit that has
[31:44] tried to take you out in your journey
[31:47] for the God toward the kingdom of God
[31:50] every bit of that has to bow to the
[31:53] authority of Jesus Christ we just asked
[31:55] for the Spirit of the Lord to take up
[31:58] the word you take up Lord let your
[32:00] spirit take up this sword and deal with
[32:04] those enemies and let us see the kingdom
[32:07] of God grow and prosper let's see the
[32:10] people of God break out of their prison
[32:13] and prosper in this late late hour it's
[32:17] possible it's it's not only possible
[32:20] it's happening and you might as well be
[32:23] a part of it
[32:24] you might as well put your faith in and
[32:27] believe that God can do the very same
[32:30] thing in your life you know sometimes we
[32:33] come under the influence of darkness
[32:35] because of what we're willing to
[32:37] tolerate it's it's not always what we
[32:40] participate in that's one way you know
[32:45] you can get involved in dark things by
[32:48] what you participate in you can you can
[32:51] you know a lot of people go to fortune
[32:54] tellers and a lot of people use those
[32:57] kinds of dark arts and the reading of
[33:00] tea leaves and reading of the palm and
[33:02] all of that kind of stuff when you do
[33:05] that then you open up your life the
[33:08] Ouija board and the seance and and all
[33:11] of this Halloween ridiculousness you get
[33:14] you get caught up in some of that and
[33:17] when you do you're opening the door for
[33:20] the dark side you're opening a door for
[33:22] the demonic to come in and and you know
[33:26] we saw a huge increase this is not going
[33:30] to be a popular thing to say but we saw
[33:34] a huge increase in in the demonic in in
[33:38] this kind of witchcraft when when the
[33:42] the children's books came out and the
[33:45] movies that followed and now amusement
[33:47] park rides etc built around this this
[33:51] whole idea of wizardry and learning to
[33:55] be a wizard and learning to operate in
[33:57] these kinds of spells and so forth and
[34:00] and I know many of you may not agree
[34:02] with me but we saw it in our nation we
[34:06] saw a large increase in this kind of
[34:09] spiritual attack and resistance when
[34:14] these books and movies became so popular
[34:16] because what they ended up doing is is
[34:20] taking something that can be so evil and
[34:23] making it look so appealing and so
[34:26] common and oh there's no harm in that
[34:29] and it's alright for children to play in
[34:32] and Dibble and dabble in those kinds of
[34:35] things and we saw kids dressing up and
[34:38] putting on the round glasses and and and
[34:41] trying to carry out the the nature of
[34:44] the character and the first thing you
[34:46] know is it's it it calls in an attack
[34:52] and and it becomes a bigger problem and
[34:54] we've certainly seen that and you have
[34:57] to whether you're aware of it or not it
[35:00] brought an increase of that of that
[35:03] demonic realm of Witchcraft and Wizardry
[35:06] spells and incantations but remember no
[35:09] matter what it is we got the sword we've
[35:13] got the remedy by the grace of God he
[35:16] has provided it for us but you may not
[35:18] actively participate in any of that but
[35:22] maybe you've tolerated it maybe rather
[35:25] than resisting it you just kind of go
[35:27] with the flow you know like any old fish
[35:31] can float down the river but it takes
[35:33] one with a backbone to swim against the
[35:35] current in Revelation chapter 2 verses
[35:38] 18 through 23 the church is being
[35:42] rebuked here not for what she actively
[35:46] participated in but for what she
[35:48] tolerated if you remember correctly to
[35:51] tolerate involves allowing something in
[35:54] our life
[35:54] that is not wholly approved Jesus
[35:58] condemned the Church of Thyatira for
[36:02] tolerating the influence and the
[36:05] teaching of that woman Jezebel remember
[36:07] you suffer Jezebel to teach to have
[36:13] influence to have authority and so you
[36:16] might not have been that church in
[36:18] Thyatira they might not have all been in
[36:21] a league or in Allegiance or alignment
[36:25] with this Jezebel spirit but they
[36:29] tolerated it they didn't want
[36:31] confrontation they didn't want to deal
[36:34] with it it was too much effort it seems
[36:36] and so they just sat under it doing
[36:39] nothing about it and I'm telling you
[36:42] that's not the way to expose the schemes
[36:44] and devices of the enemy we can't be
[36:47] passive in this hour this is the closing
[36:50] hours of time as we know it the kingdom
[36:54] of God is coming to Planet Earth there's
[36:58] a lot that's going to take place between
[37:00] now and then I believe there's a bride
[37:03] of Jesus Christ that's being prepared
[37:06] for for a final thrust of ministry
[37:11] that's gonna make a huge impact on the
[37:14] earth and then I happen to believe that
[37:17] little bride is going to slip away for a
[37:21] beautiful time of honeymoon a beautiful
[37:25] time at the wedding feast of the Lord
[37:27] and the earth is going to experience
[37:30] some things that we read about in the
[37:32] book of the revelation and and they have
[37:35] their their foundations even in the Book
[37:38] of Daniel and I truly believe that these
[37:42] things are coming and it's a very very
[37:45] exciting time but it's a disheartening
[37:47] time it's it's a serious time and we
[37:51] need to see that and so I ask you to
[37:54] search your life if you're really under
[37:57] the influence you can really feel that
[38:00] something is coming against you from
[38:03] from darkness let's
[38:05] say you know a satanic attack a demonic
[38:08] attack the devil is is moving against
[38:12] your finances or your body or your
[38:14] family in a given way then you have all
[38:18] of these weapons available to you but
[38:21] but if in all of that you're still not
[38:24] seeing breakthrough then you've got to
[38:27] start examining your heart you've got to
[38:30] start examining what what you're doing
[38:33] what you're what you're participating in
[38:35] any doors that you might have opened to
[38:39] the enemy windows that you might have
[38:41] opened that the enemy could gain access
[38:44] to your life and this could be it could
[38:47] be from movies it could be from violence
[38:50] violent movies violent video games it
[38:53] could be from from from books that
[38:56] you're reading that that are filled with
[38:59] violence and and and filled with things
[39:02] that are not whole and wholesome and
[39:04] holy you say wait a minute you sound
[39:06] like a fanatic well you know you can
[39:09] call me whatever you'd like to call me I
[39:11] mean that you're free to do that but
[39:14] remember I'm speaking to someone who's
[39:16] got a problem I'm speaking to someone
[39:18] who may have tried prayer who may have
[39:20] tried fasting who may have tried using
[39:23] the word of God and you're still not
[39:24] seeing victory well at that point I'm
[39:28] encouraging you I'm imploring you to
[39:31] start examining what it is that that
[39:34] seems to be giving the enemy a legal
[39:37] right to keep doing what he's doing
[39:40] technically he has to retreat at the
[39:43] name of Jesus technically he has to turn
[39:46] you loose when you speak the Word of God
[39:50] over the situation with the authority of
[39:53] the Spirit but if you're not seeing the
[39:55] breakthrough something is giving the
[39:58] enemy a legal right to keep harassing
[40:01] you in that manner and it's at that
[40:03] point you don't want to become religious
[40:06] you don't want to become fanatical you
[40:08] don't want to be looking for a demon
[40:10] under every rock but what you do want to
[40:13] do is ask the Lord to give you the
[40:16] earning of spirits help you to see any
[40:20] area in your life where you might have
[40:24] opened a door created an access point
[40:27] for the enemy to come in and I was just
[40:30] storing around some of the waste you
[40:32] could be in an unholy relationship the
[40:35] Bible is clear we should not be
[40:38] unequally yoked together with
[40:39] unbelievers when we are looking for
[40:43] relationships of love and marriage and
[40:45] future as children of God we should not
[40:48] be choosing partners among those who are
[40:53] not serving the Lord does that sound so
[40:56] fanatical and archaic you you can't
[40:58] can't accept it I don't know if it does
[41:00] or not but the truth is the truth if you
[41:03] are coming into a soul tie with someone
[41:07] who has not surrendered their life to
[41:09] the Lord Jesus Christ that could be the
[41:11] place of entry that could be the access
[41:14] point I feel like telling you that you
[41:18] could you could bring something into
[41:19] your home that could cause that there
[41:23] may be someone in the home who's hiding
[41:25] pornography there may be someone in the
[41:28] home who who asks would maybe dabbled in
[41:32] some of these things and there they've
[41:34] got books hidden in the home maybe
[41:36] you're just you're just totally sure
[41:38] there's nothing like that but it could
[41:40] be that someone has brought something in
[41:43] like that it could be that you've
[41:45] received the gift I know this is a
[41:48] stretch for some people but it could be
[41:50] that you've received a gift from someone
[41:52] where a curse or spirit was attached to
[41:55] that item and you've brought that into
[41:57] your home and the enemy is using
[41:59] something that simple as an access point
[42:02] I hope you just won't give up on me
[42:05] altogether but I feel like the Lord is
[42:08] is having me to share some of these
[42:10] things because if you've listened I
[42:12] don't know how many of you have made it
[42:14] all the way to number eight but if
[42:16] you've made it all the way to number
[42:18] eight that means that if you subtract a
[42:21] few minutes of speaking about prayer
[42:24] requests and and our friends at the
[42:26] gospel channel
[42:28] then you've almost listened to eight
[42:30] hours of teaching on schemes and devices
[42:33] so so you're not a newbie you know you
[42:36] you've had some you've heard a lot of
[42:38] teaching now and I feel like that some
[42:41] of you are ready to start asking the
[42:44] Lord hey I can't get a breakthrough you
[42:46] know I've had people pray for me and I'm
[42:48] not seeing the breakthrough and I think
[42:50] maybe the time has come for you to just
[42:53] begin to pray earnestly sincerely Lord
[42:56] show me if there is anything and we've
[42:59] had this happen several times in years
[43:01] past in our church community where the
[43:04] Lord would pinpoint for four different
[43:05] individuals
[43:07] so some possession something that had
[43:09] been given I've been a missionary to
[43:11] many many countries of the world and
[43:13] I've been given many many gifts and I've
[43:15] brought lots of things home and and
[43:18] there have been times at the Spirit of
[43:20] the Lord would speak to my heart and and
[43:23] have me to get rid of a certain item and
[43:25] it was usually something I really liked
[43:28] but get rid of that destroy that because
[43:32] there's something connected to it in
[43:34] another realm and it's not always been
[43:37] easy I remember one time there was
[43:41] something I have very few things that
[43:43] belong to my father and I had an item
[43:47] that was his when he was a boy and I I
[43:50] enjoyed having it it was like a
[43:52] connection to my dad but it was
[43:55] pinpointed by the Spirit because of what
[43:58] that item was and what it represented
[44:00] and the origin of that item that that
[44:02] the enemy was using that in some way and
[44:04] I I didn't warn it I didn't want to be a
[44:06] fanatic I what again I wasn't trying to
[44:09] find a demon under every little rock and
[44:11] cranny but I believe that the Lord let
[44:15] me see and I had to do something about
[44:17] it I had to do something about it
[44:19] because when I used the word of God in
[44:22] authority I want to see breakthrough
[44:24] when I take up the sword of the Spirit
[44:27] which is the word of God I want to see
[44:29] it accomplishing what the book says it
[44:31] will accomplish and when I don't see the
[44:34] results I don't I don't say such as I
[44:37] thought the word doesn't work never what
[44:40] I say is
[44:41] what's what's wrong with me let me do
[44:43] some more praying let me do some more
[44:45] searching so I hope you can understand
[44:48] that and sometimes people are members of
[44:51] certain societies and and clubs and and
[44:55] sororities are such such things as this
[45:00] that have some dark roots and there's a
[45:05] lot of things like that
[45:06] Freemasonry for instance instance some
[45:09] of these things need to be considered
[45:11] and looked at if you're trying to close
[45:13] all doors if you're trying to close all
[45:16] windows in your life the enemy I'm
[45:18] telling you he's sly and he'll use
[45:20] anything he can and you know there are
[45:25] some times of people in this hour
[45:27] sometimes some of these organizations
[45:30] especially those who operate in
[45:31] witchcraft they'll send people into
[45:34] churches they'll send people into
[45:36] communities to to cause chaos and we we
[45:42] must not be ignorant we can't be
[45:47] paranoid but we must not be ignorant of
[45:50] the devil's devices I hope you can see
[45:53] the balance that I'm trying to draw for
[45:56] you today we've got we can tolerate any
[46:00] stronghold or any principality just
[46:03] hanging over our faith community or our
[46:07] family or our house we've got to deal
[46:10] with it you know the days of being I'm
[46:13] just gonna tolerate it I'm not going to
[46:15] confront it somebody's got to speak up
[46:17] because this is a serious our first
[46:20] Thessalonians 5 20 and 21 tells us
[46:24] despise not prophesying --zz prove tests
[46:27] all things and then hold fast to that
[46:31] which is good so you've got to do a
[46:34] little evaluation you've got to do a
[46:36] little testing proving some time to see
[46:39] if this is really something that God is
[46:41] bringing into your life or if this is
[46:44] another Avenue that the enemy can use
[46:47] I'm telling you things like even the
[46:49] computer which is an amazing blessed
[46:53] to be able to minister through the
[46:55] through the internet but how the enemy
[46:58] can use that how the enemy can form
[47:02] relationships people can form
[47:04] relationships with someone they don't
[47:06] even know and all you know about them is
[47:09] what they've told you or what you read
[47:11] and you start creating these ties and
[47:14] things are not perhaps as you thought
[47:16] you're lonely so the enemy baits you
[47:19] into this kind of a situation you better
[47:22] know who you're in covenant with who
[47:24] you're in alignment with who you've come
[47:26] into agreement with in in really any
[47:29] level of relationship in your life and
[47:31] when God is or when the Apostle Paul is
[47:36] listing the gifts he's written a letter
[47:40] to the church at Corinth and he's
[47:42] speaking to to her about spiritual gifts
[47:45] in first Corinthians 12 and verse 10 he
[47:49] mentions that one of the gifts given by
[47:52] the Spirit of God to the church is the
[47:55] gift of discerning of spirits and that
[47:59] gift discerning of spirits brings an
[48:01] extraordinary ability to help us discern
[48:04] what is valid and what is not valid
[48:08] because sometimes the enemy shows up in
[48:11] the gray and and we can't distinguish
[48:14] black or white is this good or not is
[48:17] this God or is this the enemy trying to
[48:20] set things up for disaster and so that
[48:23] gift of discerning of spirits is one to
[48:26] ask for it's one to seek the Lord for
[48:29] and we're told to to seek for and ask
[48:33] for the gift to believe that God would
[48:37] would allow those gifts to operate in
[48:40] our life and I love prophecy and I love
[48:42] tongues and interpretation and miracles
[48:44] and and faith and so forth but but I'll
[48:47] tell you I think one of the most
[48:49] important spiritual gifts to ask the
[48:51] Lord for in this day in the moment we're
[48:54] living right now is for the discerning
[48:57] of spirits Lord let me be able to judge
[49:00] and to discern between that which is
[49:03] which is evil and that which you
[49:05] good some have said about the gift of
[49:10] discerning of spirits that it's like a
[49:12] spiritual Geiger counter that has a
[49:15] special capacity through the Holy Spirit
[49:18] to detect a presence of the demonic or
[49:20] or and sometimes revealing surprisingly
[49:24] detailed and accurate knowledge about
[49:26] the identity of the spirit or the
[49:29] intentions of the spirit and I've seen
[49:31] the gift of discerning of spirits
[49:32] operate that way
[49:34] you know a Geiger counter is a is a
[49:37] measuring device for seismic activity
[49:39] and and it can measure what can't be
[49:43] felt and what can't necessarily be be
[49:45] observed it goes deep and into the root
[49:49] of what's happening underneath the earth
[49:51] and and sometimes you know we we call we
[49:57] make a decision or we call a situation
[49:59] by what we see or what we hear just what
[50:03] we the gut feeling and I'm not telling
[50:06] you that that the gut feeling is not a
[50:08] good idea but there's something higher
[50:10] than that if you're a Holy Ghost spirit
[50:13] fill believer you have every right to
[50:16] believe God to operate those spiritual
[50:19] gifts in your life and you have every
[50:22] right to ask the Lord to help you walk
[50:25] in a greater measure of the discerning
[50:29] of spirits and that way you can sort of
[50:32] begin to detect and to and to know what
[50:36] is the root what is the root of this
[50:39] thing and what can be done to cut off
[50:43] the life of a particular attack or
[50:46] particular curse this Jezebel thing is
[50:51] something that we can't go into in the
[50:53] time that we have left but that spirit
[50:56] of control that operates in the same
[50:59] manner that Jezebel of the Old Testament
[51:01] operated in and I mentioned the kind of
[51:04] controlling Jezebel spirit that was
[51:07] operating in the Church of Thyatira and
[51:10] it is so sly it operates for a long time
[51:15] sometime for years even sometime beneath
[51:18] the surface
[51:19] and then when that spirit rises up and
[51:22] begins to take a hold of a church or of
[51:26] a community or of a family it can really
[51:29] wreak a lot of havoc and we've got to
[51:32] believe that even in those very serious
[51:36] situations we have Authority we have
[51:40] victory but we've got to be able to see
[51:42] in the spirit and know what we're up
[51:44] against and in all of the warfare in all
[51:48] of the of the discovery of trying to
[51:51] know what it is that's going on guard
[51:54] your mind guard your thoughts don't
[51:58] allow your thoughts to run off in in
[52:01] every direction but pray for the
[52:04] covering of the Lord over your life so
[52:07] that you do not operate in paranoia that
[52:10] you do not become a paranoid person but
[52:13] that you become a sensitive person to
[52:15] the things of God I hope that makes
[52:17] sense one of the of the other very
[52:21] important pieces of the of the spiritual
[52:25] armor that we were reading about just a
[52:27] moment ago is the helmet of salvation
[52:30] the helmet of salvation we think about
[52:34] salvation is is when the Lord saved our
[52:38] soul and we have salvation in our heart
[52:40] and and we think of salvation is
[52:43] something rather abstract but but here
[52:47] the scripture said that we should put on
[52:49] or take on take the helmet of salvation
[52:54] if the breastplate is there to protect
[52:58] our lungs and our heart and other vital
[53:01] organs
[53:02] what would the helmet of salvation
[53:05] protect well of course the other very
[53:09] very vital organ in the body the brain
[53:12] but but on a spiritual sense in a
[53:15] spiritual manner the mind we are to put
[53:20] on the helmet of salvation as a form of
[53:23] protection for our mind the greatest
[53:27] battle ever fought is being fought right
[53:30] now
[53:31] on the battlefield of the believers mind
[53:35] this is how the enemy desires to to
[53:39] influence you is with your thoughts you
[53:43] know he's not gonna just March up to you
[53:45] without a mask and and tempt you into
[53:49] something that he already knows you're
[53:51] not going to swallow but but if he can
[53:54] slightly twist your thoughts over a
[53:57] period of time and discourage you with
[54:01] lies until your faith sinks and you
[54:05] become so despondent that you can't even
[54:08] call on the name of the Lord then he can
[54:11] come in and present something to you and
[54:13] you may you may swallow that hook line
[54:16] and sinker
[54:18] we're in a stronger time in your life
[54:21] you would have refused it and recognized
[54:23] it immediately for what it was
[54:25] we need the helmet of yeshua we need the
[54:28] helmet of salvation to protect our mind
[54:32] and to protect our thoughts the head
[54:35] which we could say includes the mind is
[54:38] what's being protected notice Paul says
[54:42] take the helmet of salvation take it
[54:47] that means put it on receive it and put
[54:52] it on so just being born-again just
[54:56] calling on the name of the Lord doesn't
[54:58] automatically place this helmet of
[55:01] salvation of protection over our mind
[55:04] and over our thoughts we must actively
[55:08] remember that we have this beautiful
[55:12] piece of armor given to us by the Spirit
[55:15] of the Lord and we must make every
[55:17] effort to take it just like the
[55:20] scripture said and put it on and it's
[55:23] being it's being spoken in kind of a
[55:26] commanding way take take the helmet
[55:30] indicating that even though we are saved
[55:32] the helmet is not automatically in its
[55:35] place when we when we meet again we'll
[55:39] carry that just a little bit farther
[55:41] because this salvation helmet is a very
[55:45] important part in in walking in a place
[55:48] of encouragement instead of walking in
[55:51] discouragement and father we just pray
[55:53] right now that you will take the words
[55:57] that have been spoken today we we delved
[56:00] into some uncomfortable territory there
[56:02] just a bit and there may be some folks
[56:04] stirred by what we have said but I ask
[56:07] right now but the truth that has been
[56:10] spoken today will reach its target and I
[56:14] pray Lord that the courage of the Lord
[56:16] will be upon the people of God and they
[56:19] will recognize if the enemy has had
[56:22] advantage in their life because of any
[56:24] of these entry points and I pray that
[56:27] you will increase the discerning of
[56:30] spirits in their life that they would be
[56:33] able to see what is good and what is not
[56:36] good what is of you Lord and what is not
[56:39] of you and I pray that you would remind
[56:42] them in that moment of every tool of
[56:46] every weapon of every piece of armor
[56:49] that you have given us to stand against
[56:52] the wiles of the devil and I pray right
[56:55] now that every every dark attack and
[56:59] every secret attack of the enemy
[57:02] and and his entry points would be
[57:05] exposed and revealed to the people of
[57:08] God right now and that their discernment
[57:10] again would be sharpened and they would
[57:14] know the mind of the Lord for how to
[57:16] move forward to break out and to break
[57:19] through what the enemy is using all of
[57:22] his schemes and devices against them
[57:26] against their families against their
[57:28] churches we pray this hope in the name
[57:32] of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our
[57:35] Messiah I'm passionate about it because
[57:38] I believe it and I know that he works I
[57:42] know that his word works I know that he
[57:46] has given us what we need to win this
[57:49] battle he is the victory and I want to
[57:53] thank you for giving us your attend
[57:56] today and studying the Word of God with
[57:59] us and I hope that you'll join us again
[58:01] the next time god bless you we love you
[58:04] bye bye for today
