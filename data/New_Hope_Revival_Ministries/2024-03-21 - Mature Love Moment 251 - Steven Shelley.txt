TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so we are learning to love with a mature love which is an unconditional love it's the love that God has loved us with he didn't love us any less when we were unlovable he loved us the same and this is the kind of love that we're being called to in this hour as the bride of Christ if you want to be successful in anything you do for the Lord you must love you receive love and you know there are those of us who struggle in receiving love I know people who who really struggle to say the words out loud to the Lord I love you Lord and you don't want to be critical of somebody like that because they're struggling with receiving love and when you struggle being loved it becomes automatic that you struggle expressing love but if you could catch a revelation today of how much he loves you with every shortcoming with every failure with every bump on your nose or wart on your elbow with with your with your crooked eyebrow with your Hang-Ups with your complexes he loves you you are valuable in his kingdom we know this and we quickly say Amen but to know it changes everything everything to really know it to really know that God loves you in your Uprising in your downfall he loves you in your successes and he even loves you through your failures his love is not fickle it's not relative and it's not conditional he loves us unconditionally and because of that we learn to receive love and when we learn to receive love it's easier for us to give love and to express love is anybody with me and so if you can develop a relationship with the Lord where you can not only tell him that you love him but you can show him by the life that you live it becomes easier then to live a lifestyle of Love toward the brothers and sisters so it really goes back your ability to love one another as Christ has loved us it really goes back to an element of whether or not we can receive his love he's good to us the ability to receive God's love and to and to use his love to let it flow through us like a pipeline it must bring an authority in the realm of the spirit are you following what I'm saying it it must bring a boost to our prayers love it must bring authority to the way that we deal with things in that other other realm and in that other dimension so love transcends the dimension that we're operating in now the the realm of the natural love transcends the realm of the natural and it moves into the realm of the Supernatural and when the supernatural is activated by faith anything cancer has to die anything can happen
