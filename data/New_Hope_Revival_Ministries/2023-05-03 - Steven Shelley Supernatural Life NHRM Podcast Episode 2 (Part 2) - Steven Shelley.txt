TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign [Music] Shelley and I'd like to welcome you back to the nhrm podcast this is going to be part two with not only my dad but my pastor Stephen Shelley and first off I'd like to thank you so much for the response that we got from the first podcast it was unbelievable we were looking at it right before we started filming this and it was around 1100 views on YouTube and 1800 views on Facebook and that's not even including on the app or any of the other platforms that we have it on so just thank you from the bottom of my heart this it is super encouraging to see how well this has done I've had people come up to me that I would never think would sit down and listen to this and tell me how much they enjoyed it I've had text messages phone calls so just thank you once again I'm so happy and I can't wait to keep this going um and also I would like to say happy birthday he decided that on his 55th birthday he was gonna do a podcast with me so I'm excited happy birthday and uh I'm excited for this part too with you thank you so much 55 that's pretty big it's getting up there how about I read a birthday scripture go ahead this is what's in my heart today and I know we're doing a podcast but but uh five is the number of Grace and so when I think of being 55 that's Grace Grace and that reminds me of an important prophetic scripture Joshua in Zachariah chapter 4 and verse 7. it says who art thou old great Mountain before zerubbabel Thou shalt become a plane and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace double five unto it moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands of zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house his hands also finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you and then verse 10 for who hath despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubbabel and that plummet is a Plumb line and this studio has been dedicated to the glory of God and we call it the plum line studio and so uh in the hand of zerubbabel with those seven they are the eyes of the Lord which are the Sevenfold Spirit of the Lord which run to and fro through the whole Earth Earth and I know that's a bit of a mystical sounding scripture prophetic but it means a lot to those of us who have embraced the message of the hour that headstone coming you know when they were building the pyramids the Pyramid of Giza uh that one main pyramid never received its headstone or the Capstone that sits on the top and brother Branham did some powerful preaching concerning the coming of that headstone with cries with shouts of Grace Grace so I'm keeping that in my mind today so that I don't feel too old Grace Grace well thank you for coming on on your birthday I know you could have been doing other stuff but I'm glad you decided to do this with me um before we start talking we kind of left off about where you how you came into the message and stuff but before we talk about that and keep going on your story let's go back a little bit and you wanted to correct something I remember you saying I do I I watch part of the uh podcast and I had forgotten that I had stumbled around just a little bit when you asked such a great question you asked me how old was my grandmother when I was telling you the story of how sister Alice Flanagan walked up on the porch and invited her to church I actually choked up when you asked me when I was telling it because I realized that she had always said that was the first time in her life that anybody invited her to church so you asked me how old she was and I I just kind of stumbled around thinking that she was born in the early 30s but in fact she was really born August the 9th of 1924. so uh in 1949 she was 25 years old so she had lived for 25 years on the earth without anybody everybody invited to church and uh you know that is incredible and it it I hope that someone will hear this and they will go ahead and get the courage that they've been looking for to invite somebody sure you know sometimes we think well our services are long and and and you know we're a loud church and we jump around a little bit and worship a little little uh expressively so maybe I won't invite but if the Lord puts it if you feel that urge that nudge to invite someone to church don't you think you ought to go ahead and do it for sure I do I think you should go ahead and do it and I'm so glad I'm so thankful I loved sister Flanagan very much she would come to visit my granny many years later uh she lived in Louisiana and she would come and visit my granny and I just I couldn't thank her enough because she invited my grandmother which you know really brought me into the faith yeah uh just being inviting people to church there's somebody I play softball with and he was we were talking the other day he's like what would your dad do if I walked in and I was like well he'll probably be shocked I said but he'd be more than welcome and I'd love for you to be there absolutely and that's just I mean sometimes like you said you just gotta have that courage just to invite that person and because you never know what they're going through either you don't you don't and church can be such a help for sure uh it can be such a comfort to get in the presence of the Lord and and and unity with with everyone with other believers and sometimes receive instruction you know advice from the Bible to help us navigate and it may be the most simple thing that you would look over but to them it's something big exactly right Joshua um now we wanted you wanted to talk about how your great grandmother I did because that's that is a pretty amazing story I mentioned in the last podcast maybe I would tell that sometime and and I'd like to do that it really fits in with what I just said about my grandmother her name was Mildred and she was 25 years old when she was invited to church but she had had a pull toward God for many years but didn't know anything to do about it she told me and told many other people through my lifetime that many mornings she would wake up in her 20s and her pillow would be wet with tears where she had gone to bed at night praying for her loved ones to be saved when she herself had never really accepted the Lord she she really didn't know how but she knew that there was this relationship somehow building in her heart toward the lord and she didn't see that in any of her family you might remember that I told you that she had 15 brothers and sisters she was a twin uh her twin only lived for a little while and and uh passed away his name was Adam and my grandmother weighed four pounds when she was born just a tiny little little thing was she the oldest or no no she wasn't the oldest uh uh I glanced at it and her parents would have already been in their late 30s when she was born so she was one of the 15 there were several younger than she uh she actually had 16. my great-grandmother had 16 children one passed away and she raised her nephew because his mother died her daughter at childbirth so she raised a grandson who later became he's passed away now but he later became a circuit court judge in Dothan Alabama really a very respected man and I don't know why I'm even telling this but one of the things that my grandmother liked to tell is that when he graduated from high school now that made my great-grandmother quite old raising a grandchild and uh the one of the things that was written in his annual is that he was the cleanest uh student and uh that meant a lot to my grandmother because she knew that her mother had washed his clothes on the old scrub board and had boiled them in a pot down by the by the Brook and uh sorry when she passed away my great-grandmother Lizzie the doctor said that her backbone was worn completely into and that she was a walking Miracle they did not know how she could walk with a severed spine and that had come from scrubbing the clothes for for 16 children because she raised raised my uh her her grandson but anyway uh my grandmother said that growing up there was no talk about God much in her home uh I told you they were sharecroppers and that meant they didn't leave on their own land they they lived on somebody else's land and helped farm the land and uh my grandmother did say that on occasion they would go to a service they called it protracted meetings and that was at an old church not too far from the house where she grew up uh in in near near between Clayton and Clio Alabama um and that they would only have service like every five or six weeks there was a preacher who would travel like a circuit preacher and they called them protracted meetings and she would go and she said as I began to grow up I never got anything out of them because she said literally the preacher would be preaching his sermon and he would have to pause to go to the back door of the church and spit out his tobacco juice so that he could come back in and finish and even she not being a Christian she knew that wasn't much of a Preacher and so she just kind of made her own relationship with the Lord I want to tell this kind of funny story and then I'll get to the very special night uh because my grandmother only weighed four pounds she was scrawny as a little girl she was a very large woman later in life and and my name for her was not grandmother it was Big Mama and always called her that my whole life much to the uh aggravation of of my family but uh we had we had a mutual understanding and it didn't bother her a bit but anyway uh so she was so scrawny that she said her aunts would come to the house and they would line up uh the girls her sisters and they would say oh this one is so beautiful and that one is so beautiful so healthy because in those days if you were fat you were healthy you were skinny they thought you were sick and so my granny being so scrawny uh her aunts would just look at her and they'd go hmm and shake their head and feel sorry for her so she went out this is the truth it happened she she showed me one time I have a picture of my granny squatting down by the fireplace in the old home that she grew up in it was already a shackling but I took her back there and she as a little girl she ran outside so hurt her feelings were so hurt that nobody thought she was pretty and she said I knelt down by the warmth of the chimney she said it was I could feel the heat coming from the chimney and I prayed every day for different things even though she didn't really know what she was doing and she said I took my hand on my leg and I pulled the calf of my leg around sideways and I prayed Lord let my legs grow this way so that I can be pretty like my sisters and she prayed that because she wanted fat legs and she told me that literally about three weeks later she looked out at her legs and the calf of her leg was growing sideways and it scared her so bad I'm sure that she ran out to the to the chimney and prayed Lord if you will let my legs grow back like they were I will never bother you with something so superficial again and but so she had this prayer life and God even answered and so forth but uh there the family wasn't saved and they they cursed they talked ugly and there was some drinking among some of the family and so forth but my grandmother tells the story after she had moved to Columbus after she had given her heart to the Lord she prayed so hard for her family to be saved and one Christmas Eve she went back down to the farm and the whole family was gathered now you can imagine with all those siblings most of them married by now and the children so there must have been 30 or more grandchildren she said the whole house was full and the porch was full and the yard was full and she said it was really a lot of noise and some confusion she said her sister and her brother-in-law were fighting she said they had fought all day long disagreed and and shoved one another and carried on and another sister's husband was a Baptist preacher and he had heard about how my grandmother had received the Holy Ghost and he had all day long had been poking her and telling her there was no such thing as the Holy Ghost and speaking in tongues was of the devil and and he had poked her all day long and she said there it was just a a rough day and she said the food was on the table and people were going in and eating and and she said to me Steve all of a sudden I don't know what happened nobody was praying nobody was talking about the Lord she said as far as I know he had not been mentioned at all it had even been a while since my brother-in-law had poked at me for talking in tongues but she said all of a sudden the Holy Ghost fell in that big old country home his presence just came sweeping in it was Christmas Eve his presence just came sweeping in that room and people began to weep and call out to God she said her brothers or sisters her sister-in-laws and brother-in-laws fell on their faces around the sofa up and down the hallway and in the kitchen around the table chairs people were calling on Jesus to save them because the presence of the Lord had so shifted the room in the atmosphere nobody knew what to do but to call on the Lord she was slain out in the spirit of God she went out in the spirit and landed on her back in the living room and when she came to she said that's when she saw what had happened her whole family calling on the Lord and a prophecy was going out of her mouth thus says the Lord build me a church on Highway 10 and call it Shiloh and I will save people and heal people and I will show myself as God Almighty the same Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever wow she said it had never occurred to her to build a church her family had never thought of having a church yeah and she told me she said I sat up uh pondering what had come out of my mouth and my little mother Lizzy my great-grandmother was running through the house she said here come my mother clapping her hands now before this my granny would say to her mama why don't you pray why don't you pray and my great-grandmother would say honey I can't pray I don't have any closets in my house and the preacher at the protracted meeting said that the Bible said when you pray you must enter into the closet to pray pray and she said so I realized I couldn't be saved because I don't have a closet to pray wow uh all of a sudden here she come running through the house clapping her hands screaming at the top of her lungs I wasn't even praying and Jesus reached down and saved me I I wasn't even praying and Jesus reached down and saved me and my grandmother said coming right behind her was the Baptist preacher that had poked at her all day long her brother-in-law and said speaking in tongues wasn't real and he was running through the house screaming behind my grandmother great-grandmother saying people this is real people this is real I don't care what they say this is real this is the Holy Ghost like the book of Acts she said I got up and somebody said Mildred go out on the porch and she said I went out and opened the screen door and my nieces and nephews were around that porch praying and I watched them one by one as they come up speaking in another language had never been in a Pentecostal service in all their life so there was over 40 people filled with the Holy Ghost that day not even say this or anything no service going on and it changed the trajectory of my family you can only imagine sure somebody said why did that happen I don't know all I know is it was the answer to my grandmother's prayer she just prayed Lord I want my family saved I want my family to serve you and my great-grandmother after that she became a pillar in the church it was built you have been to the church because a few years ago my aunt was buried there and that is the church on Highway 10 that my grandmother built Shiloh my uncle you met my Uncle Jimmy my aunt was buried there and my cousin oh yeah I do remember I do well that is the church that's why okay my grandmother is if I knew that I forgot that that's why she's buried there that was the first church she built three churches that was the first church that she been did she build the one that we were in before this one she did so she did build that one too okay but uh anyway so I have so much to be thankful for uh while they were building that church they put up a brush Arbor which is like a tent but there there's no canvas on top you just put up you cut down brush and shrub out of the out of the woods and build a a frame and you laid that brush up on top I'm getting a little emotional because God met them there it wasn't a church yet it wasn't a fancy tent but it under the shrub under the brush Arbor God met my family filled them with the Holy Ghost healed the sick uh I I could tell you all kinds of stories that that I remember from hearing I met so many of those little nieces and nephews in my life later that had come up speaking in tongues so I heard their testimony as they were adults of that night and how God come in so I it's your heritage it's my Heritage we have so much to be thankful for I wanted to share that no I'm glad you did you just never know where God will meet you at I mean it could yeah I you know like you said it wasn't even church service was just house eating dinner but that reminds me of like Maul how God met Maul in the car that day yes I mean that's that's the same thing you didn't if you'd want if you want to you go out well I've told how my grandmother got saved on my daddy's side and my great-grandmother got saved and filled with the Holy Ghost on my daddy's side but my mother uh was and and and we lost her this year she was sick with Alzheimer's several years so we feel like we lost her years ago but but we actually buried the old house that she lived in just a couple months ago now and my mother made so many sacrifices for me Joshua I did tell in the last podcast of of some of her life and the beatings and some of the things she went through but I wanted my mother saved so bad uh she had been through so much and I hurt for her and I wanted her saved so bad she smoked and she drank and she cursed like a sailor and but she had a good heart you've heard people say that but it's true she had a good heart she worked at the bank but she partied hard and I'd say to her mother you you know I wish you could quit smoking because your clothes smell like smoke and she'd say Steve don't say that to me she'd say I know I know it's not good for me but you got to die with something I mean you know this was her attitude when she finally did get saved and and got delivered from from tobacco and all the things she was addicted to she said it's the most awful smell she'd ever smelled in her life yeah I remember I said she couldn't she couldn't stand being around that smell out what makes she opened her closet and smelled her clothes and and it made her sick but anyway um uh and my mother made it hard for me in the early days of preaching she didn't understand and she locked me out of the house at times I think I mentioned that maybe I think you briefly briefly did and uh but I loved her and I didn't I didn't hold it against her and the more she made it hard for me uh the more I prayed for her and uh I thought one day she'd come to church and walk down that Altar and get saved well I was pastoring that little Assembly of God Church that I told you about that I had started pastoring at 16 and she was living with me in the parsonage of the church which was right next to the church and working at the bank and so I did tell her I said now mother if you're going to live with me I want you to you're welcome to live with me I'm 16. um but I I would you're going to have to go to church with me on Sunday you're going to have to because the church requires that that's only right oh she said I don't have no problem going to church so I thought one of those Services when the Lord was moving and people was getting saved she'd get saved she didn't budge she'd smile people getting blessed and happy and she loved the people and they loved her but she didn't budge but one morning she left that parsonage and she drove toward the bank in Downtown Columbus Georgia she crossed the old Dillingham Street bridge that I got you to drive me across last night when we came back from dinner celebrating my birthday I thought about it as we're crossing the bridge and mama said something came in the in the car and she knew she was lost and she had to do something about it and we know what that something was it was the spirit of the Lord it was the spirit of conviction and we need that to pull us to Christ and she said all of a sudden she began to weep she was smoking a cigarette at the time and and she said she rolled down the window I guess she was a litter bug she rolled down the window and she threw that cigarette out the window into the river uh over the bridge and she said Lord Jesus if you'll save me and deliver me I'll Never Smoke another one and that was that she never smoked another one she gave her heart to the Lord that was her salvation experience sometimes later I baptized her in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ she received the Holy Ghost and she loved the world I won't go too far into this on the podcast or so many different kinds of people will see this but she loved the world and she loved to look like the world and God had to deal with her heart that modesty is important for Christian women God had to deal with her because she was used to showing everything and God had to deal with her about covering up and and being modest and uh getting rid of some of the things that that she like to decorate with like the world does but he changed her life and well Joshua that's one of the best things the Lord ever did for me was to save my mama and I was so thankful very very very thankful that she gave her heart to the Lord and that it happened you know it's not the same as my great-grandmother's experience there but but it's supernatural to me and it just showed you I mean God will meet you wherever wherever you are he will if you'll just call on him you don't have to be in church you don't have to be dressed up you just have to have a sincere heart and say Lord Jesus Come into my life and forgive my sins I want to be saved and I want to serve you I want everybody to understand that we don't just get our sins forgiven so we can go on and live a rotten life we ask him to forgive us and Deliver Us and sever us from those things so that we can live a righteous life a holy life a clean life we could never live it holy enough or clean enough it's his righteousness that covers us but we have to make every effort to serve the Lord to pray to read our Bible to help others get to to that place of Salvation so it's a life of service uh this is a little bit off topic but it was on I was thinking about earlier do you have a you've traveled all over the world ministering and we're going to get back to your life story by doing access before I forget it you've traveled all over the world do you have a favorite place where you preach at uh cause it's beautiful or because of the people I mean or both well I love Africa that's what I figured that was going to be one of Africa and um I have been in many countries in Africa uh but but if I had a couple that would would be very dear to me it would be Ghana and Kenya for sure these are countries that I've had on my heart for for over 25 years over 25 years before I was married and I have been blessed uh the the people in in Ghana are so sincere and they love the Lord they worship with all they have and and I feel like they're my family and then in Kenya you've got to experience uh my family there and today is also it is Pastor Peterson guandero's birthday it is happy birthday happy birthday to him he's a few years older than I am I don't remember how many but a few years older than I am and we share a birthday and he has been a particular blessing in my life and his family his twin sons have been a special uh part of my life but uh God's people everywhere will will get in your heart I've been all over Canada I've been all over Europe and preaching and and Poland and uh the United Kingdom so many places Ireland and Scotland and then uh Iceland is is if if I had to say the third place it's it's Iceland and it's not because there are big crowds there of Believers but they're just some of the most precious people in all the world so that that's a good question and and without Iceland and stuff I mean we wouldn't be able to stream the studio really wouldn't be because God opened the door yeah and that's a story for another podcast sometime uh after you've had some other guests say when we get Hawk on here to talk about it let's tell some of it but but how how God connected me with with the station in Iceland and brother Erickson to me is Supernatural it's miraculous and I want to say one other thing um I had a lot of people ask me about the right division book yes and I just want to get this out here so they can hear it you are in the middle of rewriting it we are almost finished rewriting it and when I say rewriting it I mean just updating the language yes just a little bit uh I don't know that we're gonna add to the story itself but we're just updating the language a little bit because it was initially taken from audio recordings um I I have the old uh edition of write the vision and if someone just could not wait I did not want to wait I can send them a uh a computer file a digital file of the original we don't have but maybe a handful of the books anymore that I had so many people text me and ask me about it so I didn't want to I wanted to say that before I forgot about that we will have that and we'll make that available on our website and on our app as soon as and we're going to print it because I think a lot of people would be interested to read that we're going to print it and it tell it goes into a little more detail about the life story but yeah that's a good point because I also had a lot of people asking yeah I mean the next day everybody was asking well what's the book who wrote it where can I get it I'm like he's in the middle of rewriting it and redoing it so it should be out hopefully soon I have another book that uh hopefully a couple couple more that will come out and one is a book that will tell uh many of my experiences my dreams and my visions that God has given me through the years Supernatural experiences uh it is called my eyes have seen the glory and uh it it had it's actually we actually have a prototype of it printed already uh I believe it's going to be a blessing to people but I'm sort of in the process of of making sure that we've put put what needs to be in and it you know there's been so many experiences we're just trying to make sure it's hard to get them all in but you can watch for that too my eyes have seen the glory and then I have a third book that's coming called possessing Bridal inheritance and uh I I'm having a hard time turning loose of these books they're they're they're so almost done you've been working on them for a while for years yeah I remember when we used to go down to the beaches to work that's when you worked on down there um back to your life story we we ended the last podcast kind of talking about how you how you came into the message and how you found the message and through Brother Cleveland in the tapes I want to go I want to say this you had already talked to your big mama about how you thought there was something else yes and y'all were going around to tent meeting to tempt me and she went around she went along with you she did and you not knowing that she already knew who brother Brandon was correct yes and so when you left North Carolina she was already sick back in Georgia correct that's correct you went back and you were going to tell her about brother Branham that's right I wanted you to tell him I didn't tell that no no I don't think we had gotten that far because I went back to hear the end just to make sure because it's a good story and I want to know like I will I'll let you tell a story and then I'll I'll ask you some of that stuff I think I did mention about being in Anderson South Carolina and brother Gerald clean you did yes and sister Delane bringing me the the paper bag of brother Brandon and how you didn't listen to him for a long time listen to him and then uh things started going downhill and I was weeping one day and praying and the Lord said the answer to your problem is in that bag and I took it down and began to listen and I listened that day to uh all of the tapes I think it was six cassettes all together because he preached this Sunday morning and Sunday night the spoken word is the original scene then I got the warning from my Deacon you know you might better stay away from that uh there's kind of a cult that follows that Ministry and so forth and Etc but it was too late once I heard the tape it was too late I heard the sermon but once I heard the sermon I knew that that brother Branham was carrying uh the the the spirit and power of Elijah and that's what you had been looking at that's what God had spoken to me as a young boy the spirit and power of Elijah would forerun the second coming of Jesus Christ he spoke that to my heart and I preached it and my granny warned me remember she said you better be careful people will think that you're preaching about you which nothing was farther from my mind because we were going to tent meetings trying to find someone who was operating in that courage in that power uh and in that prophetic ocean that Elijah operated in but I knew the minute I heard that voice as soon as I heard in fact I told you this I think um I ran over for lunch my mother was off from the bank that day and uh was cooking lunch she was frying okra on the stove and I ran in and spun her around hugged her and spun her around and I began to try to tell her I didn't have the right words and I said Mama I have heard the voice of God speaking to me through a man's voice and I wasn't saying in any way then or now that brother Branham was a god no he was a mouthpiece for God in my life and I believe in his generation sure when I began to hear that I you know over a period of months I listened to uh every tape I could get my hands on and they were long sermons and some of them hard to follow uh they they went against so many things that I had been taught uh theologically and let me just give you one example and that is in the Holiness Church if if I called my granny and she wasn't there I would have this thought I've missed the Rapture or or if I was going along and said a little something I shouldn't say or did a little something I shouldn't do I thought I was lost and so the church I grew up in had no understanding whatsoever of the security of the believer and that uh that God saw us in his foreknowledge he knew us and he saw us before the foundation of the world and it's not that we don't have a choice we have free will but his foreknowledge in his foreknowledge he saw my choice before I ever made it and the Bible says I've got the scripture here that we were predestinated to be conformed to the image of his son and I I that when when I began to hear brother Brandon preach about the security of the believer and that there was a place that you could know that you were saved you could know that you were not going to be lost when I began to hear him teach that salvation is not something that you get and lose and get and lose and get and lose now I want to make sure that I'm clear I don't believe that that salvation is a license to sin or that Grace gives you a right to go out and and do things that you shouldn't do but what I'm saying is once you belong to God once you truly belong to Jesus Christ and you are now filled with his Zoe eternal life if if you stray if you go away if you do something you shouldn't do I begin to understand from Brother branham's preaching he will woo you God will chase you now he will chase you down he will pursue you because you're his yeah there's no running away and it's not that he would ever say I'm done with you yeah you see I have this understanding today that God will never be done with me he'll never be finished with me I'm I'm a part of him and I didn't have that in Pentecost we thought everything was sin they taught me that everything and nobody agreed and I heard things like women had to wear hats to church or women couldn't wear hats to church or caffeine was sin and some people would say you can't drink a Coca-Cola but they would eat a whole chocolate cake we would have a lot of centers in our church well I I would be wrong because I drink coffee every day one cup every day at least but but in those days nobody wanted to be wrong and they were really preaching things like that which kept people in total confusion yeah total confusion and so when I began to Feast on the message of the hour uh what brother Branham was given by God to preach uh to fulfill scripture scripture was actually fulfilled in his ministry because as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming I believe the message that was given to brother Branham was set to forerun the second coming of Jesus Christ so that a bride could be prepared and ready to meet the Lord and I don't I don't uh I I don't mince words with that I I I want to say that very clearly that I am fully persuaded that the message that he preached is a message sent from God to prepare a people for the Rapture and I'm one of those so it wasn't that I was so wrong and so lost in the in the in the other churches it was God leading me and he will lead you folks if you'll let him he'll lead you uh and and you don't despise where you've come from and criticize churches that you've come out of you just accept the fact that God's leading you to deeper and deeper truth and that's what he did now the first thing I wanted to do was tell everybody and I thought that everybody would be excited about Jesus name baptism I thought everybody would be excited when I could explain to them from the word that there are not three Gods God the Father God the son and God the Holy Ghost as though they're separate Gods but it's one eternal spirit God one eternal spirit operating in three distinct offices Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the New Testament Same Spirit same God I thought everybody would be thrilled I thought everybody would be thrilled when I could show them that the Bible said do everything you do in the name of Jesus Christ and when I would invite people to come and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I thought everybody would be interested in that because we could prove it by the Bible but I found out very quickly that when you start touching people's Traditions yeah and when you start touching what people have always been taught what mama taught him and Granny taught him and grandpa taught us stir up you will stir up some devils just to be honest with you so I didn't know how things were going to go when I drove when I got in my automobile my grandmother was already sick uh she had had a terrible car accident and uh while they were taking care of her in the hospital in Montgomery she was coming back from a Revival that I was running in Alabama near the Mississippi line she had this terrible accident and while they were taken care of her in the hospital they x-rayed her lungs and found out that she had lung cancer it had started in the female organs and had spread to the lungs and uh her days were very very numbered but God miraculous miraculously gave us a couple of years with her when when it was said originally months maybe weeks wow um so she was uh she was probably at that time still doing some income tax actually because that's what she did when she was able that's what she loved doing was helping people with that but I didn't know how she was going to receive it but I knew that I had to get in my automobile and drive four hours to to tell my granny that I had found the ministry that had operated in the in the spirit and the power when I first recognized that I called Brother Cleveland and I said I want to go tomorrow I want us to go and hear Brother bran and where will he be where can I hear more I want to go where he is if I could shake his hand I'd be thrilled but I want to hear more and and brother Cleveland just chuckled a little bit he said brother Shelley brother Branham died in 1965 well that was three years before I was born I was bummed I want you to know I remember the feeling that struck me I was bummed so I'm on my way to tell Granny and I prayed all the way Lord Jesus prepare her heart prepare her heart and I got here and we had some good fellowship and I don't remember exactly how the morning went but but I said big mama I want to talk to you I said you remember how we went around to all those tent meetings and we we went to find someone who was operating in that spirit and power of Elijah and I said you remember how disappointed we were she said oh yes I remember she said I remember the night that you you got up and sat in somebody's chair there was a preacher who was telling people that night the tent was packed out and he said uh I am the Elijah to come if I'm not going to call his name but if I did many people would know the name uh I am the Elijah to come and and he said if anybody sits in this chair this is the the chair that God has anointed for for the Elijah prophet and my mouth is just hung up if anybody sits in this chair God's going to strike them dead tonight to vindicate who I am and I I'm told my granny I'm going down there this man is not an Elijah Prophet he's a false prophet and I'm going to sit in that chair well she went crazy you know tried to stop me but it was too late I was already halfway down the aisle and I sat in the chair and swung my legs back and forth as a young man to show him that he was wrong and and of course he covered up by falling down on one new knee and praying Mercy for me that I wouldn't be slain but God I knew in my heart that was just phony baloney and I told granny it reminded her how disappointed we were uh with that kind of stuff and she said yes I remember and I said but Graham me I have found the man I have found the ministry that I believe came in that same spirit and power of Elijah and she said oh you have and I said yes ma'am she said his name wouldn't happen to be William Branham would it well I was just shocked I was just totally Blown Away I said yes ma'am as a matter of fact it was but I had not heard the name yeah and so had she gone to she said okay she said uh I said why have you never mentioned it to me and she said I'll tell you she said but I won't tell you until you do me a favor I said what is the favor she said I want you to go and climb up the Attic in the attic and it was a pull down ladder and I want you to go up and there's a there was a bed up there because one of the one of her children actually stepped in the attic for a period of time uh and and near the headboard is a big uh cardboard box sealed up on the top and she said you'll recognize it and you bring it down here to me and we'll open it and then I'll answer your question so I did I went up the ladder got the box dusted off the top come down open it up and it was full of spoken word books books brother Branham sermons and even the original single uh seal sermons that he preached on the seals before they bound it into one big book and do you fear cancer as an eagle stirth her nest uh lots of the tracks that were distributed in the Branham campaigns and I said big mama why did you have all this and why is it all sealed up in the attic and why did you never tell me and she teared up and she leaned up in in her recliner and she said honey I was scared I said you know I wasn't used to that side of my granny she was no there's a lion and I said big mama what do you mean scared and she said I went and she told me the whole story and she said brother Branham was in Birmingham Alabama and I think that was 64. 1964. and she said I wanted to go so bad and she said but the denomination that she was in was looking down on that it was Assemblies of God and they were looking down on brother Branham because he wasn't one of their preachers and so she said there was a lot of discouragement you know of going no no encouragement but she said I was going to go but I didn't want to drive by myself and she said I could take off work and go but but I didn't want to go by myself I couldn't find anybody and she said I finally found sister Minnie Jackson and sister Jackson was a precious Old Saint little tiny sister that lived here in Columbus old Holiness Pentecostal woman and she was so skinny I'm telling you that you could see her bones through her through her clothes she was a skinny little sister and she was uh you know she was an older lady already and she was said I'll go I know they don't want but I'll go so they went up to the meeting and got there early and stood in line for hours to get in to get a seat and she was so blessed she was so blessed by the sermon and they had gotten a motel and they were going to stay the next day and after the service sister Jackson said sister Shelley I'm so homesick I can't hardly stand it she wasn't critical of the meeting she loved the meeting but she said I can't I want to go home and my grammy said but sister Jackson it's over four hours to take you home and she said but I can't stay here you've got to take me home and my granny said I was in a real uh predicament but she said I wanted to honor her and so she said we got in the car and went to the motel got sister Jackson's things and we took I took her straight home and she said uh I stopped in at the house and walk your granddaddy up I didn't want him to to know or hear that I had been in Columbus in the middle of the night and didn't tell him or run into brother Jackson and him say something and upset your granddaddy so she said I woke him up and said to him Ralph I I brought sister Jackson home she wasn't feeling good and I want to go back to the meeting and he said well you've already got off you might as well go back she said I got right in my car drove all the way back to the motel four hours because I wanted to be there the next night and I think it was that night I think it was the second not not night not the first night that brother Branham preached this sermon and she said he it scared me because she said he was saying something like God changed Abraham Abram's name to Abraham and it was a b-r-a-h-a-m-7 letters and she said I don't think he said it but I'm sitting here and I go b-r-a-n-h-a-m seven letters and she said um that seems strange she said then he told the story about how the The Travelers came there to the tent of Abram and Sarah and began to tell them what God was going to do for them and remember Sarah laughed and one of those one of those visitors knew that she was laughing even though he didn't hear he spiritually discerned that she was behind the tent They're laughing and and so he was explaining that and then she said he turned his back at the end of the service and he went all the way down the row with his back turned to the audience and he said I'm doing this because they say that I'm somehow reading the people with some kind of mental telepathy or something but the gift of discerning of spirits and discernment was so strong in his life that he would go down the line tell people their first name last name address doctor's name ailment sometimes a letter or something that was in their purse I mean it was so accurate and my granny was a her mouth just dropped open she was sitting close enough to the road that he chose that she could hear the people gasping and saying that's right that's right that's right that's right so it's back his turn and a whole row of people are being ministered to and he's telling them their name and he's reading it by the spirit off their mailbox 473 you know something Lane and it's so she had seen gifts before but nothing that profound and it scared her and she said I didn't understand it and I didn't want to speak one word against it because I knew it was holy and I knew it was God so I got the material but when I got home I boxed it up and I put it up there because she said I felt like at some point in my life I would know more about it yeah and she said I didn't speak of it she said maybe a few people right after it happened but I didn't speak of it so she said that's how you were born and you came along and we spent so many hours in church together and I never told you about it and and I said to her I I said some very personal things to her uh because of being a woman pastor and I don't want to go too deep into that but I just told her I said you know if if this ministry is is a promised Ministry and what God is doing is that is to help prepare a bride well we're going to have to line up with the word he preaches and she said that's right and I had talked with her before about about holding the authority of a woman pastor and I don't want to offend anybody but I just know what the scripture said and she had argued with me every time but in that moment she she she hung her head and she said I have I have labored all these years in that position and it wasn't even my responsibility and I said yes ma'am that's right you were doing God a service without being in the center of his will and that was it yeah he stepped down when when she when you found out that she knew all along who brother Brandon was what was were you mad that she didn't tell you almost mad but I understood after she told the story yeah and I would rather her have kept that from me look God has a timing for it that's what I say I mean you got to trust God's timing and maybe you know because some people get get off balance when they find a ministry as powerful as brother Branham there have been so many who have gone off balance who have become cultish who have lifted up a man instead of the word I have precious friends and acquaintances all over the world that have gone way too far that have emphasized a man hang his pictures everywhere in their churches and have made him uh really it would be so embarrassing to him because he was so humble his ministry was so humble and and my focus is not on brother Branham my focus is on the Lord Jesus Christ but I truly feel like God used William Branham his ministry to introduce me to really introduced me to the revelation of who Jesus really is yeah so I honor him and I respect him I do not believe he was infallible I believe he was a man and I believe that he made mistakes but I believe that when he spoke thus saith the Lord it was the saith the Lord and I believe that there's a lot that that anyone could learn from a Ministry like that it'll wreck your life it'll change your life yeah but we as the bride we go on WE march on we take the truth that has been restored through Luther and Wesley and brother Branham and we go on we don't we don't stop we keep moving uh toward what God has for us in our day and that is that a holy generation of people would be raised up with Bridal inheritance as the sons of God as the Bride of Jesus Christ to to cast out devils and to heal the sick and to raise the dead this is our it's our inheritance and uh but for me God really used the ministry of brother Branham to help me get there and my grandmother was thrilled you know I was able then to share materials with her and watch what few video clips we have and listen to sermon after sermon after sermon so the last few months of her life uh 12 to 18 months of her life were filled with feasting on the word and she she uh let me tell this because she being Assembly of God she always had baptized in the titles like a lot of denominational churches I baptize you in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost which none of that is a name those are titles father is not a name son is not a name even Holy Ghost is not a name but without a revelation that's all you know to do and that's what we all did until we had a revelation but the Bible said the father hath chosen him and highly exalted him and given him a name that is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess the Bible also says do all that you do in the name of Jesus Christ and then Peter quickly in Acts 2 38 repent he said and be baptized now who was Peter Peter is the one that Jesus asked whom do men say that I the son of man am and he said well people say you are John the Baptist come back from the dead or Elijah the Prophet come back from the dead and he said who do you say I am Peter said Thou Art the Christ the Messiah the Son of the Living God and Jesus turned to Peter and said Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock not Peter the Revelation Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it this same Peter who received a revelation of who Jesus is is the one who said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins but my grandmother had never done that so she said this to me Joshua she said will you take me to the to the old church this was several months now after I had had witnessed to her and was uh given her the tapes and she was so blessed and so happy she was already on some oxygen at this time but I came home on a weekend and and to visit her knowing that my days with her were numbered and she said uh will you take me to the to the church honey she said the van is out here she just bought a church van and she said I'd like for you to take me in the van and she had just paved the parking lot with concrete and she said I'd like to see the parking lot and I'd like to go visit the church and just see it I don't know if I'll be able to go to church Sunday or not I said sure Big Mama I'll be glad to do it so I help her out we get to the church uh I I stopped to do something I don't remember and I hear water running in the baptistry and I and I thought to myself well she wants me to clean out the baptistry because I'd not push baptism on her uh I just had witnessed and iron water ran the Baptist I thought well she wants me to clean out the baptistry why didn't she just tell me the baptistry needs to be wiped down and cleaned and I don't have nobody else to do it I said I would have wore different clothes and I walk on through the church mumbling to myself why she didn't tell me and I get around there and I said big mama what's going on she said I'm running water in the hot water in the baptistry she said it's almost full and and I said well why didn't you tell me that you wanted me to clean out the baptistry because I would have wore different clothes but I said it don't matter I can replace these you know that kind of thing she said what and I went through it again she said I don't want you to clean out the baptistry I want you to baptize me in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so God had given her that Revelation so I have the privilege when were you baptized I was originally baptized in in school uh I I heard about this baptism and and I I actually uh had had a baptism but but didn't understand it didn't really know what I was doing so when I heard the the message truth and began to preach what God was revealing to me I was in Galax Virginia preaching for Brother Kyle Kinser and his son brother Sammy was he knew what I believed but I had never really after coming to the truth I had never had a baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he knew that and they were having a picnic on the New River at that day and I said brother I would it would it confuse your people if they found out that that I had a baptism in Jesus name many years ago but didn't understand it and I got you to re-baptize me and I hear I have been preaching to me and he said oh no it won't confuse them and so they took me out in that chilly cold New River and baptized me in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and that would have been about 89 about 1989 I would guess that would be my best guess long time ago I'm sure it did a long time ago and I have baptized several thousand people since 1989 including in Israel I've baptized people in the Jordan River in the name of the Lord Jesus the dead seat and not I've never baptized it by the Dead Sea no but I baptized in the Jordan River and in the Sea of Galilee that's right that's right Sea of Galilee we baptize some there I baptize in fact I in Jerusalem or in Israel I've baptized people from over 40 nations in in the Jordan River uh Taiwanese even mainland China uh I've baptized Believers after introducing to them the Oneness of God and the baptism in the name of Jesus I have and you know I believe it's the right way I don't understand it son that that people have such a problem wearing the name of Jesus I don't even fully understand why Satan hates that so much but but I have a friend who's just been walking through a trial because the Lord has revealed that to him and he wants it done right and it's it's hard where he is to find someone that will do it because they they feel like well Jesus said in the name of the father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost but see Peter had a revelation of what the name was and you and I have a revelation it's not titles anymore it's the name of the Lord Jesus and he knows it's the right way he knows it's the right way but he's finding it hard and and it's confusing to people and then there are those who go around saying well it doesn't matter what they say over you whoa whoa whoa whoa then why is it in the Bible exactly if it doesn't matter no say well it doesn't matter what they say over you it says what's in your heart but don't you want to do it the Bible Way don't you want to do it the scriptural way I do yeah I did yeah um so when did you move back we're gonna we're gonna finish up your life story and about what we're going to talk about I guess when we moved in here too um you moved back to Columbus after after your big mom passed away because I started pastoring the old church that's right and then we eventually ended up moving here um let's do I'll I'll bring this up you were in Canada and you saw this girl walk down the aisle stuck up stuck up with their nose in the air and you attacked your buddy and said I want to marry that girl I said that one day will be my wife when was that when was that well that what we married in 97 that would have been several years before then I don't know exactly what year it would have been that I saw her the first time but we married in 1997. now where do you want me to go in the story to Mama or or or to when I moved here or what let's go to let's go to Mom and let's start okay well I was already living here and uh it's kind of an interesting story I was preaching um it's very interesting that you would say that because uh I got a text today from a sister in our church on my birthday who said I heard you preach in Michigan I think she said 31 years ago this week or something like that the first time was 31 and in that meeting in Michigan there was a couple from New Brunswick Canada that had come down with a quilt that a sister had made of the life and Ministry of brother Branham she'd made a quilt of the significant stories in his life and there was a brother and sister from Canada who brought that quilt down and showed it to uh in the fellowship hall to anybody who wanted to see it it was unbelievable you haven't I haven't that's what I thought but I didn't get it and yeah I tried to buy it I offered them a thousand dollars which was lots of money for me and lots of money for them in there in the early 90s but but they said no that sister wouldn't sell it she just let us borrow it to come down here but I really wanted the quilt I really wanted it but anyway uh come to find out years later it was it was your mother's mother yep Nanny Whitaker who made that quilt so I got the quilt but I had to marry the daughter together hey but it was a blessing no I was up preaching in New Brunswick Canada and a brother and sister walked in with their daughter your mom Stacy and she walked in and her nose was up in the air and and she was beautiful she was beautiful and and I just put we were sitting on the back row waiting for my turn to get up and preach and I just punched my buddy and I said you see that girl right there one of these to that's going to be my wife and he laughed you know and and said something like you're right like she's not gonna give you the time of day because we had just seen how she walked in and it was four or five years later before we married yeah but I learned her family I met her family found out she was the woman with the quilt and loved that story and uh went and visited her parents many times and they came here many times and your mom came here for the ministry many times and stayed with uh a sister Judith that you and she stayed there when she would come to visit and I fell in love with her and um I I didn't know if she would ever ever reciprocate I didn't know if she would ever love me I I and but uh in 97 uh she was here for a visit and uh we all some of us went on a trip there was lots of lots of uh young people and and that went on a trip uh to to uh Helen Georgia and to Stone Mountain you've been to Stone Mountain and uh I just told her on this trip I really care about you and and uh I would love to have a relationship with you and I don't remember exactly what she said but she let me know that there was something there and I remember sitting on the top of Stone Mountain and telling your mom if you're I was so broken at that time I'd been through a real nervous time maybe you could almost call it an emotional breakdown really it was I don't like saying that but it was um I was just really broken and we had had some issues come up in the church and I was just broken and I remember sitting on the top of Stone Mountain and saying to her if you are in love with the preacher I don't know if I'll ever preach again that's how I felt at the moment I don't know if I'll ever preach again so if that's what it is about me that you love I I don't want to be I don't want to be dishonest with you I may end up being a trash man uh so if that's what you love but if you love me then I'd like for us to see where this will go and and uh let's see it was uh September uh no August August the 28th of 97 I asked her to marry me and three months later on November 28th we were married so that's awesome and God healed me you know He restored me and restored my mind and my emotions and I've done a lot of preaching since then but at that moment I I was I was so disappointed in people and I was disappointed with myself and how I had let problems affect me and I didn't know if I'd ever go on but you know we all get to those Dark Nights of the Soul those places where we question who we are and uh am I doing what I'm supposed to do but God just confirmed it to me and so we married in November of 27 a year later Benjamin came a couple years later UK aimed in Libya than Mariah and I'm I'm blessed I'm so so blessed God gave me the best when he gave me your mama I'll tell you that right now for sure um she's special but before that my grandmother did pass away in September of 90. and before she passed away she asked me would I would you consider coming back and pastoring the church here and and teaching these people what you've taught me and I said yes ma'am I believe that's what the Lord's calling me to do there was a time I thought I'd spend the rest of my life in South Carolina but I felt the pool and um and I agreed I told her that I would that that would have been of the end of July of 90. and so I started coming down every weekend in August of 90 and she passed away the first weekend of September of 90. so I actually started preaching every Sunday the first of first weekend of August of 90. and and God moved but there were only a handful of people left because of her sickness and her kind of stepping down and people not really knowing what all was going on and after I had been here a few weeks some of the few that was left left uh they weren't going to take this this new way I was able to baptize a few of them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but two weeks after my grandmother passed away believer started showing up I was about to ask they just started showing up did they know about it they just began to hear uh Jonathan hollis's dad brother Marion Hollis heard that I had received this truth and he started coming and telling others and and I met the wallaces and I I met so many precious families and the next thing you know we just started filling up I was just thinking a lot of those people that started at the old church are still with us I mean a lot of a lot of them have gone to be with the Lord yes but but they're kids and and yes you know now I'm pastoring their children their grandchildren and their great-grandchildren I mean uh I've been here long enough now uh 33 years uh this this year will be 33 years of pastoring this church and 48 years of ministry and so I'm blessed now to to uh baptize the children of of the children yeah the grandchildren that's crazy young marriage that's crazy to think about God God's been so good to us um but the church in Columbus you know it was a nice building and we enjoyed worshiping there but God began to give a vision of a of a piece of property and he he gave me a couple of visions and and I saw a cedar trees on the property in a certain pattern and uh and God began to speak and he said I want you to build a refuge for eagles and that's why this Campground is called Eagle's Refuge is because it was the word of the Lord that began to direct us and I went to several other pieces of property uh with a real estate agent and I I loved one I fell in love with one but I couldn't make it Fifth Division I couldn't make it work and so finally they brought us to this piece of property we only had 50 acres at that time and um or 48 I think maybe in the beginning but um it was stripped it had just been stripped for lumber uh hardwood it had ruts it was ugly there was a one thing pretty about this piece of property not one but I told the lady I said now thank you for showing it to me let me spend some time out here and I'll get back with you and she she left Miss Faye I just thought of her name and I just went on a walk and I walked down down and climbed down a hill come around and started up a hill and uh my sh I looked out my shoe was untied I stooped down to tie my shoe and and there was a Fallen Tree there so I put my foot up on that and tied my shoe and when I looked up there were the cedar trees that I had already described to the church people from the vision and I knew this was it and it didn't matter to me if it was red mud and it is it didn't matter to me if it was ugly and it was I knew and when God began to talk to me about building that steel Tabernacle down there that we use for so many they said it wouldn't be possible to be they told me it was the Builder said it's impossible we can't put it there the the ground will not sustain that kind of a building a still structure like that and finally an Assembly of God builder in this town Mr Webb he's passed away now his sons I think still built here but he come out and he said pastor preacher if you see it in a vision I can build it it's still standing it's powerful he said if you see it in a vision I can build it and he told him he said we're going to build it because I believe this man I believe he saw it and and it's there and one day we hope to restore it and close it in and continue to use it for the glory of God the first buildings we raised up on this property were the two prayer chapels dedicated to prayer and then we put the steel Tabernacle in and then many years later uh 2005 or six I believe it was we built this church here and so now everything is here we don't we don't uh we sold the property in Columbus and we truly believe that the best days of this piece of property are ahead that God has some glorious things he wants to do Among Us and he's given us this property for that purpose and we started the process of paying it off three years ago God put it on brother West Greeley's heart our associate pastor that it was time that we needed to be better stewards of what God had given us we were making the payment uh but that's all we were we were you know almost a half a million dollars in debt and uh from from everything everything we owed the property the buildings the school building everything had all rolled into one and uh he began to to share the burden with the people and the people began to give and uh we are we are uh let right at a hundred and sixty thousand is all we owe now we've had over 300 000 come in in the last couple of years uh God's been amazing this March will be three years I think but but it has been amazing and we've it's him it's just him and once it's paid off it'll be a great it'll be a great blessing and and a relief yeah for sure uh we're just so thankful because I'm excited for that um we're gonna do I'm gonna touch on one other subject before I ask you a bunch of questions because I actually posted on Facebook got some questions from people in our church all right but uh I won't touch on one of the subject um when did you get a burden for Israel and start well that's a big one that's a big question I I received a burden for Israel to pray for Israel and a love for Israel when I was 11 years old that's right 55 today I was 11. uh in 1979 my grandmother uh wanted to go to Israel for the first time and wanted to take me I take that back she may have been in a couple years before I thought you had 77. I think she went in 77 and wanted me to go but I was in school but in 79 a trip from a local church here in town uh it happened to later be the church that I graduated from their school okay um but they got a trip up and she wanted to go and wanted to take me and and she got she helped make arrangements with my teachers to let me go she just stood up in church one night and she said I feel led of the Lord that Steve needs a trip to Israel now in his formative years and people gave and and let me just tell you this from the last podcast that little lady that reached in with the colors of fire she gave the first hundred dollars she didn't have it to give she didn't have it to give but she loved me so much and believed in my Ministry what God had called me to do she gave the first offering toward that but anyway the money was raised my mother reluctantly agreed to let me go and my grandmother took me and while we're in Jerusalem we went to the the Museum of the Holocaust Yad vashem the memorial of the name and it was in the old location now it is a magnificent Museum and a beautiful location overlooking on Karim the village of John the Baptist in those days it was quite small and more primitive and there was a place in that museum where you would go and stand in a room and they would play very solemn music and the walls were filled with a mural of the bodies of the Jewish people that had been killed and piled up in the Holocaust and so you're literally standing in a room surrounded from even the door back of the door was covered with this so it it was it was quite emotional to see all those bodies most of them stripped of their clothes and piled up ready to be buried in ditches or burned and being 11 years old I knew a little of the Holocaust but I certainly learned what I needed to know that day and the the I was the only child on the tour group in the tour group mostly seniors and the tour of God at Yad vashem said to my grandmother this may be too much for him and maybe he would wait on the other side until we passed through and she said no I really believe it would be good for him and the lady said absolutely fine then and we went in and and Joshua what happened was as they begin to play the music and tell some of the story of what we were seeing the the spirit of the Lord fell on me I was 11. I began to weep in the spirit and travail for the Jewish people and I Heard a Voice that said son of man can these bones live again what was happening is in the spirit I was reliving the experience of Ezekiel and this I mean as close to it as as possible uh and it it was like the walls were alive it was it was like what I was seeing was no longer a picture and I was literally standing there and I said what Ezekiel said I answered the voice uh Lord thou knowest and I went through the whole thing these bones coming together and and skin and sinew coming up and and before it was over it was a mighty Army like like Ezekiel a god Gathering the the dry bones of Israel and and making a nation again a powerful Army again and I was weeping so hard that I had to you know kind of hold on to the wall to get out of there and my granny said what happened to you and I said I all I know big mama is I have never loved like I love today I love the Jewish people and I love this land of Israel God has given me a love so it started in in 1979 as an election how many times have you been back I have been over 25 times to Israel and regrettably it has been a few years now but I I feel like I I will go again and my purpose for going uh was not to evangelize my purpose was to go in just love just love people and support the people and be a light to the Jewish people now it's such a beautiful place I've got to say this it is an unbelievable Place once you've been you'll understand a little bit about what it's like to love I would say and to think about like you're walking where Jesus walked or could have walked is it's incredible it's incredible and it's really on my heart to host a tour to Israel next year so I hope and pray that the details will come come together and we can make it a reality I've had people ask for 20 years and take us and and I'd love to do that but I wanted it to be at the right time uh but but but God you know has made a way for us to continue to go back and and just to love and to learn we've learned so much from precious families that live there and uh our precious friend Rabbi David Friedman of of blessed memory who went to be with the Lord during the covid pandemic he taught us so much about the biblical roots of the faith and and what it means uh to to you know live the scripture yeah to walk it out but I I got to tell this if you since you asked that question um my mother's father Edwin Lamar Ellis was a soldier in the Army and uh he uh wanted to know the heritage of his family and he asked parents grandparents and nobody would really tell him about the old country um and when he got back they promised him you come back we'll tell you the whole story uh they were gone they had passed away and so he he died when I was five 50 years ago um he died not knowing his roots but having a longing a passion to know where he had come from I always suspected after the 11 year old experience that I was somehow uh had Jewish blood but had no way of proving it and Shelley itself is certainly not a Jewish name particularly and so but I just had this sense and then some years ago I was in Israel with a couple of the brothers from our church and your poppy Mama's dad brother Whitaker and I went to the Museum of the diaspora which is the museum that that documents the scattering of the Jewish people and they have a database there and uh I had some names of Grandfather great-grandfather great-great-grandfather I saw that the name their last name spelling had been changed it was once Elias or Elias e l i a s now it had become Ellis e-l-l-i-s um and I had all that and I wanted to use the computer and there was a holocaust Survivor who was hosting people in that in that little room precious little short Jewish lady showed me the tattoo on her arm from the concentration camp and she said so you want to you want to prove you're Jewish and I said I I don't know if I am I just want to know if my family was Jewish and I explained to her about my grandfather dying and never knowing and she said well you know let me let me talk to you a minute and she said it's a wonderful database but it's incomplete and she said to this day no one really has been able to come not knowing that they were Jewish and prove that they're Jewish but if you already know you're Jewish it's been very helpful for people to to be able to search out some of their ancestry so she said but you know who who knows no no loss doesn't hurt to try so I just sat down the computer and it you know and I typed in the names that I knew and hit enter and all of a sudden right in front of the screen it began to unfold like this my whole family your family history and I began to learn that that that my great-grandparents on my mother's side were Lithuanian Jews they were Jews from Lithuania and when they came to America they hid their jewishness and they did that because it was still a time a great time of anti-Semitism even like even like today the Jews are a hated people even today and so they put away their traditions in fact uh some of my great uncles joined the Catholic church not to be Catholics but took the hive but to hide and and so it it hurts me to know that my grandfather died not knowing but I'm so blessed to know it helps explain why I love the Jewish people so and why I love Israel so and I I think I think people would understand it more if they have if they've ever been to Israel like one time I mean that's all it takes yeah it is it is life-changing like without a doubt I mean there's so I mean there's so much things you can do but just I mean there's a Bible story for every place you go to yeah that's that's right it's amazing that's absolutely right you've stood as a little boy in the in the dry creek bed of the valley of elah where David reached down and picked up those five Stones like yeah and and and knocked down the Giant and you've been baptized in the river where Jesus was baptized and you have walked down the steps coming down out of uh the the house of Caiaphas the high priest on the night that Jesus was betrayed there are steps Stone steps that come down uh uh near the Church of uh Saint Peter of galicantu uh and the ruins of the House of Caiaphas the high priest there are these uh beautiful ancient stones that go down into the valley toward Gethsemane and We Know by the scripture that Jesus ascended those stones those steps they they've been dated over 2 000 years old so you have climbed there's not too many places that you can you can actually walk the street but that's one of the places that you know that you are actually climbing the steps that Jesus climbed in in his great Agony and and it's not that there's some power in the step or some virtue it's just the knowing of like you just you just took steps for Jesus it's just that that great feeling yeah you know just like when I go to Tucson and I go to Sabino Canyon and I see some of those places where brother Branham had great experiences with God I may not get quite the same feeling but I get a warm feeling that says wow God really showed up here exactly and I was a part of it in some way so yeah go to Israel take a visit or wait until 2024 and make it to it maybe go with us in 2024. so before we're done we got some questions we got to ask you okay let me get it pulled up if I didn't have it ready but we I post on if you didn't see it I'm going to try to do this for pretty much everybody that I have on I'm going to try to post and get like a q a so if you have questions for that person you can post them so if you're not on our private Facebook page you need to get on it especially if you're from a church all right if they're not from the church they can post they can say yeah they can send it to me they can send it to they can send an email to the church and we'll get them to you or we have a public Facebook page and they can inbox it that way but if they have questions if you happen to announce a guest they have questions for that guest we can get the questions so let's see all right first one do you have a favorite scriptural or theological God topic what is the what is your favorite thing to talk about Slash Fellowship around I hope this makes sense well I gotta be honest the question did not make sense to me but we had already to me and dad already talked about it and so I was I hope it makes sense to you because you're the one that's answering that it makes sense to me I got it I get it um I mean I love the scripture I mean I love the Bible and and so there are there are I mean it's endless I I but but there are some subjects that I feel very passionate about and it's generally those that have been so misunderstood so I would like to to read a scripture or two but I'll I'll try to be a quick uh to answer that question one of my favorite Bible themes is the sovereignty of God it it it it it well the word sovereignty means to exercise Supreme and independent Authority and when I got a revelation from the scripture that God is Sovereign and that he exercises Supreme and independent Authority Authority it answered so many questions for me and it relieved a lot of fears that I had in my life and let me just give you an example of that in the scripture in Isaiah 54 verse 16 and 17 in the Amplified version of the Bible it says behold I have created the Smith who blows on the fires of coals and who produces a weapon for its purpose and I have created the Devastator to destroy so the prophet Isaiah understood sovereignty and he's saying that before there was an enemy to fight let's just say an army to fight out there it was God who chose the Smith The Man Who Would Forge the weapons that would be placed in the hands of of let's say the Hebrew Army to fight an enemy so God already saw the enemy he already saw an army that needed the weapons he already determined what weapon would be uh most successful in the battle and he creates a Smith he creates a Craftsman to make the weapon to put in the hand of the right one to fight the battle that needs to be fought I mean that is the sovereignty of God that is God exercising Supreme and independent Authority the next verse is important because it says but no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against you in judgment you shall show to be in the wrong this peace righteousness security Triumph and over opposition is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord those in whom the ideal servant of the Lord is reproduced this is the righteousness or the Vindication which they obtained from me this is that which I impart to them as their justification says the Lord so God is saying I'm in control in Romans 8 29 I've read this verse all my life but it wasn't until I had a revelation of the sovereignty of God that I really got it it says and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God all things all things good bad and ugly all things work together to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed molded to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren and then I saw the question so I chose one quotation from Brother Branham that I think is is so fitting uh in the message who is this Melchizedek 65. brother Branham said and if he isn't infinite he isn't God God has to be infinite we are finite he is infinite or infinite and he was omnipresent omniscient and omnipotent if he isn't then he can't be God knows all things all places because of his Omni because of his omniscience omniscience makes him omnipresent he is a being he's not like the wind he's a being he dwells in a house but being omniscient knows all things now listen to this this really you know tickles me I guess you'd say he said there can't be a flea that bats his eye that God doesn't know about it you see the sovereignty of God and he noted before there was a world how many times that bat would blink his eyes and how much Tallow or fat it had in it before there ever was a world that is infinite we can't comprehend it in our minds but that's God God infinite so that word infinite is so similar to the word sovereign and so even though bad things happen to us sometime and and situations happen that aren't Pleasant the Bible said all things work together for good we find out that God even creates the Destroyer he created the enemy because he knows exactly what it will take in fact it could be summed up like this all things serve God in this process to bring to pass his perfect will so I I could go on Paul in Philippians and I won't even read it but in Philippians 1 12 through 14 Paul who's been through so much Shipwrecked beaten stoned bruised bloodied he makes a comment that these things have happened to me for a purpose for a reason and in fact he also says uh that it caused me to wax confident in my in my bonds and it makes me Bolder to speak the word without fear so the things that happen to us in our lives mold us and shape us they give us confidence they take fear from us they make us bold um they're not always easy to go through but when you get a revelation that God is love and that God loves me and that if he he may not be the originator of everything that happens to me but because he loves me sometimes he allows things to happen to me because he knows the outcome he knows that if if certain people walk through certain things they would Curse God and die but he knew that job was not such a man and he knew that if he tested job and tried job that job would come out even more righteous in the end and his life would be even a greater testimony to the truth of who God Is So sovereignty is one of my favorite biblical themes and it runs from Genesis all the way to Revelation and like you're just saying though you got to remember everything happens for a reason it does I mean some of that we're extremely close to that's what he tells us all the time is you got to remember everything happens for a reason everything half a reason and and it's sometimes it's hard to understand what's the reasoning right then in that moment but it it all works out for his glory you got to try to keep a good attitude you got to try to keep a good spirit it's not sin to ask God why no but you may not get the answer when you want it um because he he's not obligated to answer every every question when we want the answer but it'll come it'd be easy that way but that's not how yeah that's it it's his perfect time it will come the answer will come in time I can tell you this that I've gone through things I told you a minute ago about about what I was going through in 96 and 97 darkest night I you know I made mistakes um in in my hurt and pain and it was just a dark time and I needed God and I I couldn't see any good you know it felt like the ceiling was closing in and the walls were closing in and and I probably even made the statement you know how could God get glory in this but if you would have you know many people in that moment probably petted me on the back and said you'll get through this and there's a reason I didn't I just couldn't see it but looking back a few years later looking back you realize oh my God had a plan had that not happened to me I don't know where I would be or what mess I would be in so God used even those dark moments to mold me to shape me to make me a better a better man so I I guess that's one of my very favorites is knowing it's not my responsibility I think I just hit my microphone it's not my responsibility it's God's responsibility to bring about his ultimate purpose it's my responsibility to yield to him he knows best Papa knows best he does um the next one is what is the most outstanding Miracle you've ever witnessed well two come to mind I don't know how much time we have left but two things to mine um one is well I've seen the dead raised I mean that's pretty powerful and at least twice in my life perhaps three times I've seen the dead Rays someone who was pronounced dead uh by by medical authorities and and God raised them from the dead one was a precious sister whose name was Sister lock and she died in a service a nurse pronounced her dead and God raised her I've seen blind eyes open I've seen deaf ears unstopped uh one of the two greatest Miracles that stands out because I mentioned one of them the last time we were together I talked about the young man in Indiana who lost his eyesight from a weed eater accident and God restored his eyes he actually had to create eyes because there was this the eyes were so damaged there was nothing and I saw God do that but but the number one miracle that usually comes to my mind is many years ago in South Florida I was holding a tent meeting and there was a quadriplegic some quadriplegics can move their neck and he could move his neck but he could not move any other part of his body from his neck down he had a special wheelchair that he could blow into these little tubes and inhale and exhale and he could drive himself in that wheelchair but he had to have assistance at everything and we were having a tent meeting in Florida and in South Florida and we were already in the service and God was already moving and we saw a van pull up and from where I was standing I could see the whole thing they didn't come for the tent meeting they came to empty his colostomy bag he had no ability to to function with his own way East so it was all in a bag that bag had to be emptied they were traveling they saw the portalets they saw the bat portable bathrooms and so they stopped to pour out his bag they thought this is a good good opportunity to empty the bag and they were captured as they emptied the bag and he comes uh the wife took the bag in empty and comes back uh he circled around the van in the wheelchair and I thought they were leaving uh were you preaching I was preaching by that time maybe singing getting ready to preach or whatever but I thought they were leaving and and uh we went on in the sir and all of a sudden they started coming toward the tent and uh she came and sat on the back row and he came just to the edge of the tent with the wheelchair and I'm preaching away I'm moving down among the chairs and whatever and he begins to scream out loud I see Jesus he had the ability to talk he said I see Jesus standing beside that little boy preacher wow and and I was early 20s by that time I see Jesus standing by that boy preacher and uh he starts down the aisle controlling the wheelchair with his with his breath and uh about that he gets he gets within a few feet of me and he stands up in the wheelchair and steps off the wheelchair totally healed by the power of God and that tent went crazy it erupted I mean chairs were flying and people were worshiping God and and real Revival broke out and here's what happened it was so so precious too is that we were having a morning service the next morning and they heard about it and he was giving us some of his testimony we asked him would he stay and give his testimony the next morning he was injured in Vietnam he was left in this condition he was depressed he had tried to take his life multiple times they go to a hotel I think we helped pay for the hotel although we didn't have much money in those days um but we helped him get a hotel and he actually told us the next morning he comes back to the service we give him the microphone and he begins to tell the the you know the doctor's reports and all that he went through and and the hardship of his life all these years since since the 60s in Vietnam and here's what got me is he starts talking about the joy and tears are running down his face he doesn't look very joyful but he's talking about the joy of feeding himself cereal that morning for the first time since the Vietnam War that's crazy and my tear I mean I am a mess and so is everybody else in the tent so he literally was able to move in the hotel room and and when he got out of the van the next day there was a crowd of people watching the van and he gets out of the passenger side of the van and walks Under the Tent without the wheelchair wow so totally healed so that is one of the most visibly profound now to me the greatest Miracle is when a soul is saved when somebody surrenders their life to Jesus Christ that's the greatest Miracle but when you're talking about profound and visible Miracles and physical Miracles I think God healing the quadriplegic was one of the greatest that I ever saw I don't know if I've ever I guess I've heard the story at some point but I know you have you just were probably young um we've got a couple more uh what's your favorite scripture and why is it your favorite my favorite scripture is brother branham's favorite scripture Hebrews 13 and 8. uh Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever why it's because he is and it it reminds me every day that what Jesus did in his Earthly Ministry he is still able to do today so it's a revelation it's not just a scripture it's a revelation he has not changed he cannot fail um he remains ever more the same faithful and true um what is your favorite memory of brother green and brother your favorite brother Branham experience my favorite memory of brother Perry green I have many uh he was a dear man and a dear Mentor in my life and I loved him very much one of the greatest memories or privileges that I had in interacting with brother green is I got to uh host him on his last trip to Israel he loved Israel more than just about anybody I've ever known and he knew so much about Israel and when he found out that we leased an apartment in Jerusalem and we invited him to come I remember very well the day he called up and he said Steve I'm coming the the day or two before he was supposed to arrive or I was supposed to leave to get there first I ended up being in the hospital for the first time in my life with diverticulitis I had to push the doctor to release me so that I could go and be there but I wouldn't trade those days that I had with him for anything um and there there are so many more uh brother green one our one conversation that we had I mean I loved we sat up all night one night when I first met him in 1990 or 91 we sat up all night him telling me the interactions that he had had with brother Branham the conversations that he'd had the Miracles so of course I loved that um but one kind of vote of confidence that he gave me is I was speaking at a Pentecostal charismatic conference in Tucson and we invited brother green to come and give the testimony of brother branham's Ministry and uh he wanted to take us out to eat afterwards and so everybody got in the vehicle and he said Steve you come ride with me and he was Dr he was in a truck and I got in the truck and as we were driving he said I don't care what anybody says son you were built for this he said you're doing exactly what God would have you to do you're being a witness of the truth and he said loving on these people even though they may not do just like you do or you do just like they do there are many differences between you but but but God part of your birth reason is is to be who you are and and to bridge this Gap and then he looked at me and he said I don't know another man around this message that would be doing what you're doing and I just want you to know I love you and honor you for it so that to me because I grew up uh Joshua without the without the Kudos of a dad or without a dad to say I'm proud of you or you did he was good yeah he did that to me that day he was my dad that moment and for for me to know that he was proud of me instead of disappointed in me many people around the message at that time were disappointed they said he don't believe the truth anymore he's gone charismatic he's left the prophet on and on and on they said but that was never what happened but you by you doing that also has brought a lot of people to us there are many people who believe the wholeness of the Gospel now because of those influences in those days and I don't regret it I don't regret it it's just not fun being misunderstood but that was my a couple of my favorite times with brother green there were lots he was always fun to be around always fun um well not always okay most of the time um here's some guy named Benjamin wants to know who your favorite kid is oh some guy named Benjamin Benjamin it's Ezekiel my oldest son well I don't have easy I have four children uh and a daughter-in-law and I don't have any favorites I I loved you all the same and they do kid me because there's a there's one little boy in the church that that I I just love dearly and I've never told exactly why well I want to say I want to do want to say one thing about that to me Ezekiel what people don't realize is he is specialty but what people don't realize when he was a very little baby you spent we we all went on a family vacation of course they came with us and you spent hours holding him on the beach while we went and did our own things and praying and singing over him I did and I mean that's pretty I mean you know that's a little bit of a bond right there and God spoke to me now it's off topic and everything but it is I just wanted so so people I don't think you're so biased but and God spoke to me about his life and his Destiny I remember you saying and so uh so yes I I we have the most amazing children in our church I love them all they are all amazing and smart and handsome and beautiful uh but he does have a special place and and and and I won't deny that but I don't have any favorites so other than that in that way maybe a little and there was a couple other questions that you said we didn't want to give them to today so I don't think we'll have to yeah so we'll we'll pass on those but we'll definitely you know later on down the road have you back to do some other stuff and um get some more questions in and stuff like that uh but like I said I would like for you to pray again before I go off because that's something I want to do after every podcast have the guests pray and I know you did last time I would like for you to do it again and I would love it is there anything else you want to say before we I can't really think of anything except to say that you know the signs of the times are telling us that we are drawing closer and closer to the coming of the Lord and uh God doesn't have any grandchildren so if you're watching this if you've made it this far I can't imagine you know some people told me it took them two or three different settings to watch the last one but if you've made it to the end of this podcast and you do not know Jesus as your own personal savior you need to know him you need to make him Lord of your life I have served him a long time and I can say today the longer I serve him the sweeter he grows it's not always easy I'm not trying to sell you some some idea that there won't be suffering and heartache I've known my share but I can tell you that it's smooth sailing if Jesus is in the boat with you you can make it it doesn't matter how stormy it gets as long as you can look over and know that Jesus is in your boat you're in his boat you're together so I just encourage you before I pray you know you said is there anything else on my heart that's on my heart don't waste another year of your life not having peace you you you can have peace and you can know that you know that you know that your sins are forgiven and I always said salvation is a free gift but the call of God on your life will cost you everything if God has called you to serve him and to be his you'll have to be willing to give up whatever he asks but oh my the reward the benefit the peace the joy and you need the Holy Ghost you need to be Sanctified by the washing of the water of the word and you need to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire and don't let anybody tell you that it's all just fanaticism it's real he is real and he's life-changing and and I I told the Lord on the way over here today it's I wasn't trying to make a bargain with the Lord but I said Lord I don't want to I don't want to live a life of of bad health and uh bad mind and not being able to take care of myself but if you will grant me some good years left on this Earth I will serve you with greater determination and I've served you before it's that real to me I don't think that the Earth can last like it is another 30 years but if I should live to be 85 to day 55. if I should live that long on this Earth I want every one of those days to count for Jesus Christ and I want to remind you even though you're young Maybe don't waste a year in sin and living for self give him everything you've got like I told him on the way over here Lord I want to serve you with greater fervor I want to do more for you than I've ever done and I want to sacrifice more for you than I ever have we feel that way because of The Nearness of his coming let me pray for you father I thank you today that you are God's Sovereign and supreme and I love you and I honor you today and I thank you for my son Joshua I thank you Lord for his desire to do a podcast and reach perhaps another audience than what you have let us reach before bless him and strengthen him and all of my family I lift them up to you and my church family and my friends those precious ones that are watching this podcast right now and I especially pray for those who may have had a good Heritage and who may have had parents or grandparents that served you but they have not yet made you Lord of all I pray for them right now I pray that the spirit of conviction would grip their heart that they would grow tired of their selfishness and that they would call on you for salvation to redeem them and to break every feather and every yoke in their life that they might serve you in the beauty of your righteousness and Holiness I pray for the addicted that you would come and sever them from their addiction make them free and make them whole to serve you and their families with joy fill with the Holy Ghost those who set themselves apart and desire to be filled Lord if there is someone who heard a little something about baptism and I've been baptized only in titles and not in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ may they have courage right now may they be strengthened right now to make that choice and Lord provide somebody who will baptize them in the right way the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of their sins I just pray for those who have heard something today that they may not be familiar with but if there's some truth there that you have laid aside for them make them hungry cause them to be like the bereans of old and dig it out and study it out and let you speak to them by your spirit and reveal yourself I thank you God that we are not preaching the gospel of information but a gospel of Revelation and I ask you right now to let your truth be revealed to those who are hungry for it and we give you praise and honor and glory for all that you have done and are doing in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen and amen thank you again for
