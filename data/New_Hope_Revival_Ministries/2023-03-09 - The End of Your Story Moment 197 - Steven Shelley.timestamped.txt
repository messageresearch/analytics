[0:00] he knew the choices that you would make
[0:02] the good ones
[0:05] and the dumbless
[0:06] [Music]
[0:15] and the Bible in the New Testament says
[0:18] that Abraham staggered not at the
[0:21] promise of God through unbelief but was
[0:25] strong in faith
[0:30] [Music]
[0:32] gives me hope
[0:33] [Music]
[0:36] it's me a glorious hope because
[0:39] God gave us a back story about Abraham
[0:45] and my natural eyes see that Abraham
[0:49] staggered some
[0:51] my natural eyes see that Abraham made
[0:55] mistakes
[0:57] natural I see and read that Abraham lied
[1:02] to rulers to Kings somebody that could
[1:05] have took his head off
[1:08] but because that the promise of God was
[1:11] upon Abraham's life
[1:15] his life could not be taken before its
[1:19] time
[1:20] cause there was a promise that had to be
[1:23] fulfilled in Abraham's life and even
[1:27] though my natural mind my reading and
[1:30] and comprehension of the backstory it
[1:34] looks like that Abraham made all kinds
[1:36] of mistakes it looks like that he did
[1:39] not trust the promise of God it looks
[1:41] like he went astray it looks like that
[1:44] he lied and he told all kinds of stories
[1:46] about Sarah being his sister and this
[1:49] kind of thing to to cause people to be
[1:52] deceived or to let be led astray yet God
[1:55] comes over in the New Testament
[1:59] says Abraham staggered not at the
[2:02] promise of God through unbelief
[2:07] you have this same finished story
[2:12] I have this same finished story
[2:17] prefix destiny
[2:19] by God's foreknowledge
[2:22] he Those whom he foreknew he could
[2:26] predestinate or give a prefix Destiny he
[2:30] already knew by his foreknowledge he
[2:33] knew your choice he knew the choices
[2:36] that you would make the good ones
[2:40] and the dumbness
[2:42] [Music]
[2:44] the lovely ones and the ugly ones he
[2:48] knew all of those decisions but he knew
[2:51] that the ultimate decision that you
[2:54] would make would be to follow him and
[2:57] because of that ultimate decision of you
[3:00] saying yes Lord he could give you a
[3:03] prefix destiny
[3:05] and he could line out a path for you
[3:09] that would intertwine with all of these
[3:12] people sitting here
[3:16] and he could at the end of your story
[3:20] say
[3:21] as he did Abraham
[3:24] he staggered not
[3:26] at the promise
[3:29] do I fail
[3:32] yes do you fail yes
[3:36] do you make mistakes yes
[3:39] but the key is you keep coming back as
[3:42] Abraham did to El Shaddai
[3:45] [Music]
