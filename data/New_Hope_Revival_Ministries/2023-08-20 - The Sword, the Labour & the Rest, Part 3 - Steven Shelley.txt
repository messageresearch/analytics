glad that you're here glad that you have come to be a part of this service all of you that are streaming this service we welcome you uh those that may watch the service by archive we're glad that you have tuned this way and and that God is ministering to you when we have a heart a desire for the Lord to speak to us and we open up ourselves to him he will speak to us and we're glad for these that are here with sister Flo today Trey is that right and Autumn all right Trey and Autumn sister Flo is it my understanding that you used to babysit this young man [Laughter] thank you so much for the opportunity to get this off of my chair I am so happy this morning Autumn and Trey Mormon our babysit Trey when he was about 10 years old and he was really passionate he found out that I was a Christian and he was real passionate about the Lord even at the age of 10. I think the Lord called him to preach and I think he's kind of died trying to dodge that but we'll see what God does for him but when they would get there every morning his grandmother and his grandfather was good Baptist people they I come out of a Baptist Church they good people they have a lot of love and uh his granddad didn't like it because I talked to him he would ask me questions about the Holy Ghost and about the Lord and about baptism and all like that and he was only 10 and he said sister Flo when I get to be a big man Papa can't tell me what to do and when I get big I want to be baptized and I want your preacher to baptize me and I said well all right you know that's that sounds good to me so I never dreamed that when he what 30 30 38 years old he would call me and say you know I think I want your preacher to baptize me and so I'm paraphrasing a lot of this but pawpaw was jealous of what he learned and what he would say about Jesus uh they would read the Bible and he'd say papa do you know what you're reading and he'd say yeah and he's telling me he'd say oh papa that's not what Jesus meant Jesus meant you tell him was absolutely jealous of what and he told his wife Vaughn we just buried her just a few weeks ago she and I were real close friends and he told her he said Vonnie if that woman don't quit telling Trey all these things I'm gonna you're gonna stop them from going over there but they didn't they kept coming and he was so passionate about the Lord and I just the reason I wanted to give this testimony is this don't ever give up on nobody because you never know when you tell somebody today it may be 10 20 years from now when they but God has his hand on people and he has his hand on you and you be sure you're anointed when you started telling these people about the Holy Ghost and the baptism and how to be saved you make sure you anointed to do it don't just get out there and talk because you can you've got to be anointed to do it that's the reason the Holy Ghost is so important life ain't life without the Holy Ghost I'll love the Lord Brother Shelly I love the Lord I'm so excited I said coming home to church this morning and I said Lord I can go on now because you know I'm just happy and I I feel like in my heart I've done a little bit of good I've done one thing good in a way Hallelujah [Applause] Hallelujah well if he was 10 and he's 38 now that's 28 years ago that's wow well we're glad you're here today God bless you God bless you both [Music] some planted seed and some watered but God gives the increase Hallelujah we want to give of our tithe in offering today unto the Lord we're so grateful for the testimony that sister Flo gave there and and aren't you thankful for our worship leader [Music] [Applause] so grateful he can't do it by himself he depends on us to get in and worship with him any one of them brother Ben brother Chad any of them that lead brother Joshua yantus we've got to be a part of creating the atmosphere they can't do it by themselves and a preacher when it get up gets up to preach he can't do it by himself otherwise it's just words bouncing off a wall but I'm so glad there's always somebody to hear because the word of God will not return void but it will accomplish where to it is sent amen now I'm here today because I am a word sent from God and there's some more word that's got to get to me for my completion and I believe that we're here to hear it today we want to give of our tithe and offering we want to give us unto the Lord I have a beautiful number here today the balance on the loan I'd rather read this first the balance on the loan now stands at 36 507.46 Hallelujah Hallelujah you have given 430 667.82 cents I say thank you for giving to the Lord and helping us to get this debt behind us two and a half years when God gets in it it gets done if you brought your tithe and offering with you today we want you to give as giving unto the Lord they tell me Joshua Yantis with your sister Elizabeth and Kendra is that right they're going to sing while we receive the tithe and the offering brother Elias will you come in Austin yantus we let these two brothers come to you today as you give of your tithe and offering give as giving unto the Lord my Lord is faithful to give back pressed down shaken together and running over will he give into your bosom that's who he is he is faithful and he he is always on time he doesn't come when we want him but he's always on time aren't you thankful for that praise the Lord thank you Jesus thanks praise

Hallelujah [Applause] he lives [Applause] oh don't forget this is the quietest world you're ever going to live in if you think this is noisy my watch keeps telling me that you're in a very loud environment but it's not too worried about me because it it'll it knows that I'm I'm always about Sundays I'm in a loud environment and Tuesdays too you may be seated for a moment it's wonderful to be in the presence of the Lord wasn't he wonderful during worship he came and he is wonderful and worthy we don't want the enemy to receive any any attention in this service he's not worthy of it is he but if your week has been anything like mine I came determined this morning to give him my praise I came determined to lift up the name of the Lord because that's the only way as as Benjamin saying it's the only way uh we were streaming last night there was a choir uh if you'd like to find it on YouTube you can it's called the m b choir message Believers choir they are made up of mostly African and African-American believers um they uh sort of formed during covid and it was quite unusual to watch it during covet because they would be singing from different places and whoever was controlling the the zoom or or or whatever the the format was they would switch in and out and uh it was very well done and it was a blessing to people during covid uh since they can get together now uh brother gisson danner's Church in in wherever it is Covington in Covington Georgia hosted them in a larger building and uh brother Isaiah Brooks was there to sing and uh oh it was just a nice evening some of it was really good and brother Brooks was really good and Wesley Van Wyck was really good and the choir did very well but it was so nice and uh so Lively Wesley wrote a song uh I'd like for him to come here one day and sing it during a hard trial in his life he said and his mother is going through sister Sharon is going through a battle with cancer now and the song is called turn up my praise and you know what that's exactly what we have to do when Trials come when troubles come when when when hardships come we don't pull away from the one who can help us we draw up just as close to him as we can possibly get and we turn up the praise so if you think this was wild this morning you haven't seen anything we're just getting ready we're just practicing for what it will end up being I want to give him everything I have the Bible tells us to give him exuberant praise hi praise this book of So High Praise and and so we don't need to just wait till we get to church to do that we need to do it every opportunity is that right let me just briefly mention uh that there are some birthdays this week that we want to to mention and I have to because it's two of them are in my family uh sister Stacy's baby uh Mariah Destiny is turning that's that's my baby too uh is turning 17 today or has turned 17 today what do you do oh my God I don't know how it is that my wife is getting older and I'm not I I don't know how that's happening but how did we end up with a 17 year old baby it just happens and uh it's not a happy memory but it's a Memory that will will always be attached to this day in 2015 brother Perry green went home to be with the Lord and when I was thinking about that this morning when I woke up uh I was thinking what a wonderful wonderful eternity it is for them now Sister Green is with him now on the other side and they are in the presence of the Lord and they wouldn't come back brother green wanted to be remembered he he he had it in his mind that he wanted to make an impact on people's lives and he certainly did but this morning he doesn't care whether anybody's thinking about him or not he's in the presence of the Lord tomorrow that amazing worship leader my oldest son turns 25 Benjamin Judah is 25 tomorrow so let's say happy birthday to him [Applause] tomorrow is also Joseph huckson's birthday they are enjoying their last few days on the beautiful island of Iceland and will be home to us this week so we send a happy birthday across the waters and also our very very faithful streamer and he is a faithful encourager in my life brother Paul drown uh has a birthday tomorrow so we want to say happy birthday to brother Paul him so much [Applause] Tuesday is Maya's birthday Maya Goss is that right say it again well is that Tuesday you all got to check it out I may be wrong next Sunday it's the 27th and not the 22nd no wonder she looks so funny okay we're not wishing you a happy birthday Chad can you go in and change that if it's in the calendar you have access to you're the only one everybody else is locked out of it change that we're we wouldn't dare give her two birthday wishes in one year Wednesday is Ashley tibo Yantis that's how I have it in here she's uh she's a yippity you know she she's hyphenated or something in my notes Ashley tibo Yantis has a birthday on Wednesday we want to say happy birthday to her that's also brother Richard's birthday so we want to always lift him up to the Lord in prayer even though we don't get to see him we still love him and we want to ask God to help him and bless him strengthen him also that's brother Donovan and sister Audrey Lewis's wedding anniversary and uh just unfortunate that they are down with covid but we're believing that it's going to be mild and quick and that they'll be done with that I thought we were all finished with that for good didn't you but it just keeps morphing and well anyway we don't want to talk about it but happy anniversary to them and then on Thursday is the birthday of brother Matthew drost and it'll be a very happy birthday for him because they're just celebrating their new little boy in their life so it'll be a good opportunity for you to remember and pray for them and then I have this in here to mention that next Saturday is Brother George Smith's birthday and so I'll try to remember to harass him uh he is uh he is getting on up there uh what is it about 77 78 this year uh we appreciate the work that he has done for us on the sealed book and I have them I just hadn't made them available to you yet but I will do that really soon could we stand again and go to the word I know you've been up and down but uh let's thank God for these musicians what a blessing they have been all of their labor for us [Applause] hey what about that song wasn't that nice [Applause] Liz and Kendra and Josh Yantis I mean that is a new Trio there that was wonderful let me greet all of you streamers uh I see you in Cape Town I see you in Indiana Arizona Sarnia Ontario see you out in Seal um so many other places Tema Ghana West Africa we had Pastor Tay here with us last Sunday and we sure enjoyed that didn't we and uh let's see uh Zimbabwe sister Annie over in Columbus is streaming more from Ghana more from other places in Africa we love all of you and we appreciate you being with us let's turn to Hebrews chapter four are you in a rush that was kind of weak are you in a rush all right there are bathroom facilities if you need them you can go out and come back in quickly you don't you're not expected there to hold hold your your that sounds terrible how do I finish that sentence we don't want you miserable especially those of you over 50 you'll understand you have to slip out sometime do that we don't want to rush what the spirit of God would do for us today Hebrews 4 and verse 11 let us labor therefore to enter into that rest that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief are you with me for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword it's so sharp that it pierces even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit the New Testament tells us that man is is Body Soul and Spirit flesh Soul and Spirit and that line between spirit and soul is so thin that as far as we know there's only one thing that can get to that line and discern and that is the word of God it's so sharp and so quick so anointed and so powerful that it can divide between the will of the soul and the mind of the spirit and that's a battle that goes on within us because we have so many things operating in the emotional Realm of the Soul which is mind will and emotions and you as a Believer are not created to be led by mind will and emotions you are to be led by a regenerated spirit that is now the resurrected Spirit of Jesus Christ Living excuse me living inside of you as a believer but there are times that we need to know is this God leading me or is this my mind leading me is this God leading me in my spirit or am I being emotionally LED and there is one answer and that's not called the preacher the answer is go to the word go to the word of God that word of God is quick and Powerful sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of mine will and emotions and spirit and of the joints and Marrow this was the apostles way of letting you know it can go right into the inside of the bone and is a discerner thank God it it is a discerner of the thoughts and even the secret intents intentions of the heart how many of you remember when we spoke about this last we mentioned Matthew 7 judge not that you be not judged and when we look at that we recognize it doesn't mean that we can't look at the fruit and see if it be of God or not but it means we are not allowed to judge the intentions of someone else's heart now before you're seated let me remind you that sometimes we we think we know somebody really well husbands and wives especially and sometimes the the the the husband will say well honey I didn't mean that and the wife will say I know what you meant now that's the Judgment that's actually sinful let me say that again while you're all standing this will help your marriage that judgment is actually the very judgment that Jesus is speaking against you are never qualified to judge the intentions of someone else's heart there's only one that can do that and that's the Living Word of God that word of God can get down into your business that word of God can get down into the intentions of your heart and judge your motive and reveal your heart to you the Bible said we we sometimes need to show the house to the house that's what preaching is for he chose the foolishness of preaching to turn the mirror up sometime and let the house see the house thank God for the word I just want to say before all of you that I am most thankful for the word of God not just the printed page but the Living Word the quickening power that comes from the word of God is if you believe that same man I want us to pray together father we are here in your name in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua hamashiach we have come to honor you to worship you to lift up your Holy Name Your hallowed name in this house there is no God like our God and we acknowledge that among all the gods that men worship today there is only one true Living God Yahweh and we bless him and we thank him for his gift to us now we have come to look at the printed record of your word but we know that that book in itself can be used to kill we have not come to be murdered we have not come to be killed we have come to be made alive and so we ask that the Living Word would show up among us today and by the power of the Holy Spirit the anointing of the Holy Ghost you would cause this word to function and to accomplish all that needs to be accomplished in our lives today we are a tired people we're tired we're we're just confessing to you that life has made us tired and we are longing for rest we are longing for an eternity of rest with you but we are thankful that you have promised a a rest on the way to rest you have promised us a rest a refreshing that comes by the spirit it's not just provided for us by a day of the week it's much more than that but the Lord sabbah the lord of the Sabbath is among us today the one who was there in the beginning and we thank you for that and we need that Living Word to come and Quicken us back to life we need rest that that the sleeping pill couldn't give us rest that the pillow and the comfy covers couldn't give us we need a rest in our soul and that rest is in our spirit man Even Now by The Living Word of God so let that Spirit rest let it move forward and permeate the mind and the will and the emotions of every child of God and when we leave here maybe our body is still tired but let there be a leaping within us and the quickening of life within us that we can say it was good to talk with him in this manner it was good to walk along the road with him today did not our hearts burn within us as we walked with him on the road we will give you glory and honor now we take authority over every power over every principality over every dominion over every distracting spirit and in the name of the Lord Jesus in the name of Yeshua our Messiah we take his authority over that spirit we command you to bow to the sovereignty of the one true Living God and we ask Lord that your word could accomplish something in us we ask this in your most holy name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah and the Saints said you may be seated I didn't mean to take so long in the prayer but it's vitally important in this hour that we are not just hearers of the word hello but but we must also be doers of the word and that means to say I believe the word and not obey it is is a huge huge conflict of interest the Bible said if you say you love me and you don't keep my Commandments you lie and the truth is not even residing in you powerful isn't it it's not even in you it's not even abiding in you the Bible also tells us that you shall know the truth and that's not a Doctrine that's a person you see we may all still be growing in our Doctrine we're still learning of the word no one in this building has arrived yet hello we're still learning of the word he's still revealing himself somebody said well we have a message we sure do and we can't agree on it so we're still learning of the word because that word is our absolute amen but but what we can do is we can surrender our will and we can say yes and amen to that word and when God corrects our Doctrine or shows us something more uh I I thought about even praying today before we started asking the Lord that he would apply I save how many of you know how powerful it is when the spirit of God just applies a salve to your eyes brother Branham talked about being brought up in a little Log Cabin you can go in the blue room there and see a painting of the of the little Log Cabin that brother Branham grew up in and in the wintertime with a wood stove as the only source of heat and that wood stove would go down in the night and sometimes go out and they would pile themselves under quilts how many any of you ever slept that way piled under quilts so heavy you could hardly turn over maybe I need to try that again because I toss and turn a lot you wouldn't couldn't toss and turn a lot under all those heavy quilts brother Branham talks about in in his childhood uh the the children's eyes and you've you've experienced this kind of cold at night and and it forms some kind of little mucus I I don't want to make you nauseated but some kind of film gets down in your eye they they used to call the dry part of it cracklins I've heard my granny say come here honey let me wipe the cracklins out of your eye by the way that's not the kind that goes into cornbread that's not Kosher moving right along brother Adam talks about they would wake up and their eyes would be frozen swelled matted I think is the word I'm looking for matted shut you know the church has got a problem with matted eyes but God's got a bride he can talk to she may not always listen the first time but he'll just keep talking to her how many of you are glad to say I'm one of them he just keeps talking to her getting all the religion out of us God didn't call you out of denominationalism to put you in some other kind of bondage you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free you're recreated by truth you're not just set free by truth but you become a new creature a new creation because of Truth are you with me so all the little kids piled under the the quilts you know their eyes would be matted together and and Mama or granny or whoever would go over to the wood stove light up the fire and there would always be a can does anybody remember the grease can my grandmother kept them uh I look like a almost looked like a coffee pot made out of tin had a spout on it and everything and that's where the bacon grease would go but in brother branham's childhood it was Greece can you imagine and I'm sorry to tell you I've I've had a little raccoon a time or two in my life and it's not much to have the one thing you can say about that and opossum both on kosher by the way uh the one thing you can say about that is their fatty and they're they produce a lot of Grease and so mama would go over to the stove and she would put that pot down on the eye and she would melt the Grease and when it got runny enough to you she'd stick her hand down in it and she would massage that warm grease in their eyes until the Madding would go away and they could open up their eyes and see clearly sometimes we need the Holy Spirit to apply the ice have to Open the Eyes of our understanding so that we can see what God's word is really trying to say to us you can sit this is my whole point if I could get this across this morning we could go home in five minutes because my whole point is this if you could see the power and the effectiveness of this word you would never miss your opportunity to be changed by it nobody would have to preach to you to read your Bible I read where brother random said a Christian would read one chapter at least one chapter of the Bible every day this was his thoughts on being faithful to God's word what I have found about that is if you're not careful it becomes a habit and you just rush to get through it and it's not how much of God's word you go through but it's how much of God's word goes through you are you letting the word that you hear be effective in your life you control that may I tell you this morning and again if you get it we could just go home may I tell you that you control the effectiveness of the word of God in your life I don't care how powerful it is I don't care how unique it is I don't care if it's something you have never heard before and you just drop your mouth and you say wow it's possible that even in that wow moment you are not changed by that word because you don't do your part you see you control the effectiveness of God's word in your in your life in your heart in your life and we're going to talk just a little bit about how that is done we are still speaking on the sword the labor and the rest I am amazed at this verse of scripture that tells us that we must labor to come into rest it seems like a great Paradox let us labor therefore to enter into that rest let me paraphrase that for you by saying it's not going to come automatically to you you're not going to find the rest that the Apostle is talking about uh you're not going to just stumble onto it you're going to have to pursue it now truth is chasing after you do you believe that because remember truth is a person it's not a Doctrine it's a person Lord Jesus Christ or you might say Yeshua our Messiah one in the same he's chasing us and why is he pursuing us because before the foundation of the world he knew us the Bible said so in fact the New Testament tells us I you have not chosen me I know people are scared scared of Calvinism because Calvinism went into into a hyper Grace and that's not according to the word but I want you to know Calvin didn't have everything wrong because he was reading the Bible one day and he saw where the Bible said you have not chosen me but I have chosen you says the Lord and what that means is before the foundation of the world God knew you before your mother or father ever gave you your name your God already knew you before you were ever born from your mother's womb your God already knew you in fact the scripture tells us that every one of our days was already recorded in his book before we were ever born you know why that's good news to me it means that nothing in my life is ever going to take God by surprise good bad ugly he saw it when it ever came my way and not only church did he see it but he provided Grace he provided a way of Escape he saw my Temptation before I was ever born but with every Temptation he made a way of Escape for me to get out of that mess he saw it and he not only knew what I was going to face but let me remind you he knew my choice he knew that I would one day choose him in my case as an 18 month old baby when I chose the Lord but see that was my will that was my desire that was something stirring on the inside of me and I didn't know way back then that he had already chosen me and then as that little a child about all four five years old when I prayed that prayer at the Baptist Sunday school sung my prayer come into my heart come into my heart he did imagine that he did change my life at five years old fill me with the Holy Ghost at seven years old he knew he knew my life he knew the difficulty of my life he knew the hardships of my life and he provided Grace you might say he deposited Grace in my grace account for the day that I would need to make some withdrawals has anybody in here ever needed to withdraw some Grace from your grace account Hallelujah unlock your bank account Your Grace account will never be an overdraft Hallelujah there'll never be a thirty dollar fee because there will always be enough Grace Hallelujah because I'm his [Music] nothing is going to happen in my life that he hasn't already seen and that he hasn't already made a way of Escape but I have something to do I have to learn to trust him and when that word of God is going forth just as it's going forth this morning I can't sleep and I can't be distracted there's tons of things to distract us you know I don't want to keep talking about being over 50 but but you you find aches and pains you find situations that can distract you sometimes it hurts to sit sometimes it hurts to stand and you could easily be distracted by things but you have to make up your mind that I'm going to look to the words because in that book is my answer and I may not need it today but Monday's coming whoa it takes Grace to get through a Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday too but that Grace is already there but I have to participate with that Grace and I have to participate with the father's plan for my life I want to tell you something God's going to win sister Flo said something about Trey there kind of running or getting trying to get around the call that would have been my advice to him if he would have asked me as a 10 year old boy and he would have said to me brother Shelly I I feel like maybe I'm called to preach you all know what I tell people who say that to me I always say to them run run because the pulpits are full of mama called Daddy called Church club called preachers if you're just going to be another one of them sit down we don't have time for that but if he's really calling you guess what Young Brother he'll win you will never outrun this God we serve he will hunt you down he'll chase you to the uttermost parts of the earth and find you you'll never outrun the call of God in your life a man running from the presence of the Lord is the most foolish man on the Earth because he actually thinks one day he'll outrun God you will never outrun him David said though I make my bed in hell oh I take the wings of the morning and fly away like a dove he'll come to me there though I go to you know India with a backpack and climb the Himalayas and smoke dope and grow dreadlocks and he will find me there on the back side of the desert are sitting on the front row of the church wherever you end up if you belong to him and he has laid a high and holy calling on your life you'll never get away from him that's his love Oh How He Loves You and Me Oh How He let's Praise Him let's Praise Him [Applause] thank you for loving us thank you for loving us all right when we started the series we started in the Book of Genesis chapter one verse 27. so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and then in Genesis 2 7 and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground Earth and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life which is the atmosphere of Heaven So Adam Adam in Hebrew made of the red Earth a portion of Adam was of the earth earthy Dusty carnal emotional it would be once it had some life in it it's just a clay body now but then God Almighty hello God almighty reached over the balconies of Eternity and performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on Adam he put his mouth over Adam's mouth and he breathed into Adam the Breath of Life which we would call ruach hakodesh the holy spirit of God he breathed in this Mortal dirt body a body of dust and Clay he breathed into him the very Breath of God we might in Greek call it Zoe which is which is God's own life I want you to know when you receive the true genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost when you have obeyed God's word Acts 2 38 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ Yeshua the Messiah for the remission of your sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost when you are filled with the Holy Ghost you are being filled with the very Spirit life of Eternal God so that Zoe life is now inside of you in the same manner it was once inside of Adam and when that Breath of God went into Adam he was no more just bones and skin and flesh and dust and Clay but he was now a miniature God now that's where the church is check out that's where so many denominationally minded people check out but we can't change the Hebrew we can't change the original language of the Bible and the Bible is telling us that he was made in the very image and then the very likeness of God and if he were not God then he would be an idol and there's a lot of things God is but he is not an idol maker he's not an idol Builder God knew exactly what he was doing he made him with a with a holy holy spirit in him he created him and the Bible said when that breath went into that body Man became a living soul so he was not only given Spirit breath or Spirit life but now he was given mine will and emotions and God didn't make a mistake he knew that when when when Satan would show up in the garden and and possess this body of the serpent and speak lies he knew that when Adam would stand between Eve and and God and partake in the sin that Eve had already partook of God knew that in that moment that Adam would become the intercessor that was the first Adam did you all hear Pastor Tate talking to us last week about the last Adam we'll never need another one Jesus became the last Adam didn't he oh and everything that was lost because of the fall of the first Adam is regained in our lives as Believers because of the Redemptive nature of the last Adam so everything that Adam was you can be if you keep cooperating with that word you see we believe that there's going to be a short quick period of time on the earth before the bride is changed and in that moment we believe with everything that is within us that that there's going to be a bride of Believers sons of God on the earth that will function for a very short amount of time in the full Authority and Dominion of a living God just like Adam had in the beginning it's very scriptural by the way we understand that when Adam wanted to make changes in the garden he didn't do it with a shovel in a bucket he did it by the power of the spoken word we can say today that there is a people there is a people not there will be there is a pimple that carry the power and the authority of the spoken word in them right now it's not fully manifested because we're being dealt with in the soul the mind has got to get straightened out that's where the greatest battle ever fought is taking place every time Benjamin sang that verse I'm pointing up here this is the prison this is a pretty I I've never you know I've never been to jail in the natural I've never been in in real prison chains but I want you to know I can lock myself up into prison right here in my mind how many of you believe you can bind yourself you can limit yourself and right here nobody nobody has to talk to you you can do enough of that to yourself it's not other people's words that give me the most of my problem it's my own words it's my own thoughts and so we are dealing with stuff are you with me maybe this is just a lot of review for you but help me anyway we're dealing with a lot of stuff here and and you know our trials can get quite unique they're they're tailor-made their personality uh uh determined my trials will not look exactly like yours yours won't look exactly like mine now there are many common factors because Satan is not really that original so he really tells the same lie he just kind of dresses it up a little differently for whoever he's telling it to but the lies are pretty much the same but the situations in life will be different our family life will be different our our our work career will be different and our relationships will be different because what we're walking through now was tailor-made for you harnessed somebody said well wasn't it a wasn't it a a a product or a result of my choices exactly right but you're remembering perhaps that God who is Sovereign he knew the kind of stupid decisions I was going to make before I was ever born he knew all my uprisings and my down settings he knew all my strengths and he knew all of my weaknesses he knew the things that would tempt me and he knew the things that I would easily overcome are you with me and so my life was Tailor Made By Design and yes a lot of it is a result of my own poor choices but I want you to know God knew that from the beginning and he allowed those things into my life to shape me to mold me to make me to a place where I can win this mind battle he brought me to a place where I can ultimately lay my will down how many of you feel yourself getting closer to that day anybody put your hand up if you can say I really feel myself getting closer to that day that I can just surrender all my will you might as well he's not going to give up on you if you belong to him he's going to keep pursuing you the quicker you surrender the better off we're all going to be because sometimes you make us miserable given God such a hard time even my life would be a whole lot easier don't get me started if you'd quit running if you'd quit being so hard-headed but we all have the life to get through we all have these situations and circumstances to get through but every one of them are accomplishing something that's what you've got to remember when you're in the heat of the thing when you're in the thick of the thing you've got to keep asking yourself what's God teaching me why would you want to ask a silly question like that because the quicker you know what the end result of this test is going to be the quicker you can cooperate the quicker you can say yes sir I get it you're a little quiet this morning but it's still the truth you see when and when when Adam was made here he was made of two Realms the Earth realm and the Heavenly Realm he had a body of clay a body of flesh but the inner part of Adam was Heavenly Oh what a beautiful beautiful Synergy took place that day what a beautiful Union took place that day when the Breath of Heaven the Breath of God came down and touched the dusty body of man made in the image and likeness of God and he became a living Soul stood on his feet with the authority of God when he needed to put an apple tree somewhere he didn't have to have the shovel to do it he just said be there somebody said where do you get an idea like that Jesus taught it in the New Testament if you can just have faith as a grain of mustard seed you can say to the mountain be moved and it must pick itself up and be cast into the sea somebody said is that literal do you have a literal Mountain that needs to be moved because God's in the business of moving literal mountains if he needs to be but most of our mountains are not literal mountains of dirt most of our mountains are obstacles that the enemy has placed in our way and I'm telling you you've got authority over that talk to it I preaching to somebody talk to it [Applause] you get out of my way my God has given me victory over you you move out of my way I'm moving forward to do the will of my father stop me I I find yourself doing is going over the mountain God's about overcoming power how many of you feel is overcoming power in your life at times when you just can't seem to get it now we know what happened I gotta move on uh there was a serpent in the garden he was not a rattlesnake by the way we've had two big rattlesnakes killed here on the campground in the last few weeks we're not going to stop till we get them all [Music] it's over we might just invite all of them in the county come on over here coach we're going to fix you I hadn't got to kill one of these yet but I want you to know when I'm done they're dead I got a feeling Chad and Nathan are about the same way the first thing I see is the heads one place and the body's another that's a good place to start somebody said isn't that God's creation yeah and he can put it somewhere else besides here and if you're like like brother man Sonny if you're a a snake person well then maybe I'll just speak to him get off this Eagles Refuge hole in this Campground I don't want you where my children are playing come on but this this serpent wasn't like that it didn't crawl on its belly it walked upright and it wasn't ugly now must have been attractive and it was made so similar to the body of a man that you would have almost thought it was a buddy or something because Eve had no problem communicating with this serpent and I don't know a woman yet that's going to stand like the little children's Bible propped up against a tree and talked to a called up rattlesnake like it's her best friend the church can be so stupid sometimes can't we can't we all the spirits out there and sometimes it looks like the church gets all the spirit of stupid but but we all believed it we couldn't see beyond that that's all we could see even though we knew our wives and mothers and sisters would never do that but he would well it's because the serpent didn't look like that it wasn't cold around anything it stood upright reason had the ability to reason had the ability to talk and communicate with Eve and it didn't hiss at her at all because if it would have his she'd run you see Satan entered into that created Beast and began to talk through that Beast to Eve in such a way that it caused her to doubt the goodness of God if the enemy can cause you to believe that God is not fair that God is Not ultimately good that God is not out for you I want you to know he can sell you swampland in Florida to build your house on if the enemy can convince you that your God is not really a good God there are people in this room most all of us have struggled with a thought or two like that along the way how the bad things happen to good people and what kind of a just God would allow some of those things to take place that is the reasoning of the serpent it cost Eve to lay down her her moral it caused her to lay down what God had spoken to her she exchanged the word for a seed of discrepancy we could almost say that in that moment denominations were born because that's where we are in an hour like this men and women are every day willing to lay down the word of God to believe a seed of discrepancy that will never produce a seed of God a seed of discrepancy will never produce a Son of God a seed of discrepancy will always produce the son of a lie the son of a Bond woman not the son of a free woman how many of you know our mother is Jerusalem and she is not a Bond woman she's a free woman the Bible tells us our mother is free Hallelujah it's not Hagar and this is the goodness of God to us so when when Adam realized what Eve had done that's when he stepped up and said I've got to face God on her behalf and then we talked about the fact that in the cool of the day God came down but Adam and Eve weren't standing in the clearing to meet him were they they were hiding in the bushes and they their their answer was we're naked who told you your name nobody had to tell them because they send away the glory that had covered their bodies they were hidden in Shekinah light if you would have seen him you'd have thought they were angels because like Christ on the on the Mount of transfiguration light was emanating from their body we would know that if we didn't see it in the Hebrew the English doesn't seem to give us that quiet description but Hebrew helps us to know that they were clouded in light as soon as the fall took place that light left them and they realized they were naked and they covered up those parts that didn't need to be shown and they're hiding because they thought that God had come down to kill him but God didn't come down to kill him he came down to cover them I know you know that but you could squeeze an amen because somebody needs to tell their neighbor God's not out trying to kill you he wants to provide a covering for your sin the lamb is worthy how many of you know the lamb is Worthy and so the Bible said in Genesis 3 21 I know this is review pour you Genesis 3 21 unto Adam also unto his wife did the Lord God make coats of skin and clothing did you know God's a tailor did you know God's a seamstress did you know he knows how to make coats of skin but anybody that knows anything about animal skins knows you can't separate an animal from his skin without shedding blood and so right here the principle has started it started in the garden with an exchange of blood now the principle of redemption is started because these little lambs whatever they were fleecy animals they had to lose their lives God slayed them with his own hands and he made from their coat from their skin from their fur he made coats of skin for Adam and Eve because God was about to separate them from the garden of delight he was about to drive them out of Eden because there's one thing that God didn't compromise on and that is he was not allowed death in Eden not in the garden there could be no death in the garden are you with me no graves in the garden no graves in the garden so now Adam is going to die and Eve is going to die because they've sinned they've believed the LIE of the enemy and now their physical bodies are going to die and they're going to be placed in the grave one day and God said there'll be no graves in this Garden of Eden that's the garden of the light so they're going to have to be buried outside so we might as well get the business done and he drove them into Exile isn't that what the Bible tells us Genesis 3 24 so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way not to keep men out like we were taught but to protect and guard the way to the Tree of Life because no more would man just be able to go in man could have gone in and took a bite of that tree of life which represented the eternal life of God and man could have gone in and took a bite of that and try and lived forever the problem with that is with an unredeemed nature and God said I can't let that happen oh no that's not going to happen I'm not going to have a man 900 years old with no hope of salvation for today I'm going to Institute the plan of the Lamb the Lamb's plan is going into action today and I'm going to drive them out of the garden and I love it the way brother Branham explained it let me read it to you real quick even though I've already done that in in the cruelty of sin and the penalty that it costs to rid Sin from our lives paragraph 105 uh uh is that the one I want I can certainly do that one yeah I had gone back a little bit I think but that you're you're it's much better how I would like to deal there just a little bit and eat and notice when they were driven from the garden because of transgression all the blessings cut off because of transgression and I think tonight that's what's the matter with the church all the blessings are being cut off because of transgression there you are in that serious driven driven from the Garden of Eden now I want you to notice here come when Cain and Abel the two sons of Adam and Eve came forward to make an offering I believe the great cherubim was at the East side of the gate and that sword whirling back and forth guarding the gate there that entered into Eden noticed fire somebody say fire you don't believe in the Holy Ghost baptism you don't believe a little bit of tongues you don't believe in the quickening power you don't believe in somebody jumping around a little bit then you don't understand what the fire can do to a man Jeremiah encountered the fire of God he said it does it doesn't just feel like fire on the flesh it feels like fire is shut up in the marrow of my bone and I cannot control what God is doing in me that's the best place to be you all and I included we need to be in a surrendered place where we can no longer control the work that God is accomplishing in us because when we get in control we quench the Holy Spirit so we say Come Holy Spirit and stay as long as you want to stay and do whatever you need to do because we'll never get this Sunday morning back we'll never get August the 20th 2023 back once we're finished with this we'll never be able to come back and reclaim it so if we waste one second of our time together today and we don't allow the Holy Spirit to burn in us like a fire and the word to cleanse us and sift us we may never get the same opportunity again because when we come back Tuesday night the anointing will be different and the call will be different and the purpose will be different watch and the crowd will be different remember I told you Sister Green used to say right in the middle of a great big time we're having the most wonderful time the kids are there she is having a blast she's reliving in fact she's 80 something years old and riding horses with us she is really living life and all of a sudden in the middle of all that fun she'd say oh what's wrong sister green it's never going to be this way again what do you mean it's it's never going to be this way again we'll never be gathered just like we're gathered together again somebody will be missing something will be different it'll never be exactly like it is and I'd say to her then what we have to do is make the most of this we cannot let one moment of this slip by us we have to live to the foolish right now and enjoy every second of this let's go get ice cream she'd say okay she was right because we got that call just a few months ago that she had stepped out of this body and into another eternity and when my wife and I flew back to Tucson to do her funeral we realized that same Eerie feeling that fell on us in 2015 when we went back to to Barry brother green that same feeling I remember as we landed remember saying Tucson will never be the same for me again and I remember the same feeling coming in as we were going to Barry sister green Tucson will never be quite the same again we'll never go out that Bear Canyon road again and pick her up in that van and and have to push her up in that van and holler to Harmony and it's over and that is really how life is so I encourage you don't spend a day pouting don't spend the day sold up miserable mad at somebody holding a grudge against somebody live life in the Holy Spirit refuse to waste a moment of time in this life being mad at somebody you control that oh I'm preaching I don't know if anybody's helping me but I'm preaching don't do it don't let the enemy don't spend a moment of jail being jealous don't spend a moment holding on to something that you need to turn loose of or trying to want somebody to pay oh I want to see him pay the problem with that is you'll be the one you dig a pit for your brother the Bible said you'll fall in it yourself you've got to forgive you've got to let go hello can you hear the Holy Spirit you've got to let go it was the fire it was the Holy Spirit fire that was guarding the gate and today that's what guards the gate paragraph 107 if you're scared of Holy Ghost and Fire you'll never get in because you'll say oh the fire is there to keep me out but the fire is not there to keep you out the fire is there to cleanse you as you go in all we need him our God is a consuming fire he does not want to destroy you he wants to perfect you he wants to complete you can you help me you don't have to be afraid of that fire the fire is soared he said you'll never get in fiery sword of God God is a consuming fire watching that tree guarding that tree of life it's not so that he can keep eternal life away from you it's so that you can realize you'll never have eternal life apart from the Sun the Messiah his shed blood you'll only overcome in this life by the blood of the Lamb hello and the what and the word of your testimony you've got to tell somebody you can't keep this to yourself is anybody with me now I want to go quickly to Hebrews 4 11 in the Amplified let us therefore be zealous and exert ourselves I like the way the Amplified does this just a minute any good all the time nothing automatic here we've got to be zealous we have to exert ourselves remember King James says labor have you ever labored it takes exertion it takes effort it takes inertia you've got to be zealous and exert yourself and strive diligently Faithfully you can't you you can't try this week and give up next week you can't run the aisles this Sunday and next Sunday sit back there like you've lost your best friend oh just a minute um come on preacher diligently persistently consistently whether I feel like it or whether I don't I must be zealous to strive diligently to find the rest of God to know and experience it for ourselves my problem with some of my Messianic brethren is they want to so emphasize a 24-hour day and I believe it I believe God has given us a day of Sabbath for rest I believe it's a part of its plan but if we become legal about rest we lose the blessing if we become so legal that we have to get the neighbor to push the button on the elevator remember how much time I've spent in Israel if we're if we become so religious that we have to call a to come in and turn the stove on and off because we can't do that on Sabbath then it becomes such a Drudge then it becomes such a burden and the one thing that Jesus wanted us to know about Sabbath he is the lord of the Sabbath and he wanted us to know that he's not giving you rest to be a burden on your back he's giving you rest to foreshadow an age of rest and eternal rest so we pause to remember we pause to remember we greet one another if nothing else we greet one another shabbat shalom to remember that this day is different than any other day of the week this is a day that God has set aside for us to remember his provision in our life if you have a meal with your family it's beautiful to do it if you light a candle it's beautiful to do it but don't become so religious I'm on a preach don't you become so religious that you criticize others who don't have the same revelation I say this to my Holy Name Brethren I have friends in the in the sacred name movement who refused to say the word god some erroneously then call him Jehovah which we know is not his name and some of my friends out there refuse to say the name Jesus because they heard listen the whole idea came from from rabbis who who told people in the second temple his name is the name of a dog and I know Messianic people who will never even use the name Jesus because they say it's the name of a dog but here's what I tell them you've come way too late I'm very aware of what his Hebrew name is very aware I understand it I get it but remember I've seen the dead Rays using the name of Jesus [Applause] I've seen cancers fall off use I didn't always know his name was Yeshua I've seen cancers fall off and blind eyes to be open and so what I have come to understand is it's putting faith in the name I know men right now I can send you to some right now who will argue over whether you should say Yeshua yahshua or putting the syllable here or the emphasis there I want you to know if you get carried away in that you will be like so many others straining at gnats and swallowing camels that is being promised to us is arrested pursue to get to it's a rest that we have to shut off our minds we have to stop stop the LIE we have to say to the enemy I will not [Music] I'm standing on the word I'm not going to become so religious that I miss the spirit of Truth because the spirit of Truth is what transforms it's not the letter of the law it's not the letter of doctrine that transforms lives it's the spirit you let the Living Word show up he's pointing us to rest but the Apostle here is is making sure that we understand it doesn't come automatic just because you call yourself a Christian doesn't mean you're going to find this rest on your own you've got to be zealous for it a sister Flo used this word about our brother her passionate we've got to be passionate passion our desire to find the rest that's in him no May uh that no one may fall or perish this is where we're getting to by the same kind of unbelief and Disobedience into which those in the wilderness fail who this is serious business for the word that God speaks I love this for the word that God speaks you want to read it with me is alive and full of power making it active operative energizing and effective has that been your experience with the word whoa it's not a book of dead rules I believe in standards I believe in holiness I believe that men should dress and live and act like men and women should live and act and dress like women no no one doubts surely you that know me no I you I believe in separation of gender and I believe in in Holiness but but I want you to know it's it's not the dead letter of anybody's written record that's going to do anything it's that living reality of the word when it comes in the Holy Spirit quickens the word it becomes active and operative and energizing and most of all say it again effective it is sharper than any two-edged sword penetrating to the dividing line of the Breath of Life Soul and the immortal spirit and of joints and Marrow of the deepest parts of our nature exposing come on word come on Living Word of God expose me expose every part of me that is not like him [Applause] but if you get embarrassed so be it it won't be the first time I've ever been embarrassed how about you see I'm not playing with this word this is not what I do on Sunday my fellowship with the word is every day of my life and has been for nearly the past 50 years I want to Fellowship that word every day I want him to go down into the into the inside of the inside of the inside of the inside and if he finds jealousy there I want him to expose it and rip it out by the roots if there's ambition or competition in me I want it out [Music] it's the only way to be perfect in rest you see we rest when we realize that he's working all I have to do is cooperate now on the base level I'll have to do is say Amen it's the power of agreement my job is to say Amen it's not just lip service but my job is to come into agreement with that word amen amen amen and then let my life it won't just happen automatic but I have to lasso my life every thought that exalts itself I got to pull it down come on and I've got a lasso my life in such a way that I pull it back into the restraints of God's word because you can't hide from the word you can hide from the church you can hide from your preacher you can hide from your wife you can hide from your husband your boyfriend your girlfriend your parents you can hide from your siblings but you can hide from the word well that oh that makes me scared no no no it's not that kind of a fear you're not fearing the hammer that's going to crush your head remember he didn't come to destroy you he come to put your clothes on don't you know he could have killed Adam and Eve but he's a redeemer by Nature he didn't see a mistake he didn't see a failure he saw a plan whoa when he saw what Eve did as vile as it was when he saw what Adam did as vile as it was he didn't desire to destroy them he actually said now I can do what a purpose to do from the beginning tell me brother sister when was the lamb slain when was the lamb slain when was the lamb slain when Eve sinned when Adam sinned at Calvary when was the lamb slain John had to be caught up out of the nature of the flesh into the nature of the spirit he said I saw the Lord I was caught up on the Lord's Day Jews argue that it's the Sabbath Christians argue that it's Sunday and the whole church misses it it was neither it wasn't a Friday or a Sunday was it a Saturday or a Sunday had nothing to do with the day of the week I was caught up to see the Lord's day he saw this hour he saw the day that the sons of God would rise he saw the day that Sons would come to manifestation that's what he saw he saw a bride in the last days who would come out of pagan Christianity and serve the god of the Bible that's what he saw he saw a people that would win the rest they would win the rest they'd Win It not because they sat out and waited on the charge to give it to them but because they actively pursued it with passion with zealousness I must find this place of rest and I'm going to labor I'm going to sweat until I get to this place of rest I'm gonna and then when I get there I'm going to fight to stay there because it's not carnal striving we're talking about let me let me talk to you a minute I gotta I gotta say this has your bottom endured so much that your mind can't comprehend anymore can I have a few more minutes go down there to Jr's Steakhouse sometime I don't go often but go down there sometime and Chad there's a I don't even remember what it is son what is what did they name after Albert Ward a burger Reverend Albert Ward was an Assembly of God Pastor I knew all my life and asked his wife his wife died many years ago precious sweet lady uh brother Ward would go down to Jr's every day I was never in there that he wasn't in there and I have to be honest sometime I dug my head because he was a talker and he didn't understand lunch hour I'm in and out it was like he spent his day at Jr's so much so late so you go down there and see his name on the menu and remember that he's the one that got me when I was a little boy preacher put his arm around me I must have been about 12. and he put his arm around me he said little Stevie I need to tell you something I was preaching for him I remember the sermon can you imagine I was preaching on Noah at the Auburn Road Assembly of God Church because that's where the word was pastoring then little Stevie that was magnificent absolutely extraordinary but I need to tell you something hear me well and don't ever forget what I tell you the mind will only comprehend what the seat will endure that's why I was asking you about your seat it's not carnal striving fleshly striving that we do to come into rest it's Faith work say with me Faith work it's Faith work that's what it is it's not carnal striving here's carnal striving you've got to read the Bible through in one year that's carnal striving it's a good idea It's a Wonderful blessing you'll be blessed if you do it it'll strengthen you in the faith but don't put that on me I'm not gonna put that on you that's carnal striving that's trying to make people think that the more you read the more you get you can read it all and get nothing if you don't cooperate with the spirit it's just information are you calling the Bible information I'm telling you that the Bible will be no more to you than than information without the Grease without revelation without Revelation go to Cain and Abel [Music] it's time to give God an offering what did Cain do he goes out and gets rutabagers I'm paraphrasing the Bible didn't say rutabagas but I don't like them and it'd be very easy for me to give them away rutabagas brussels sprouts the Bible said he took the fruit of the ground and he was going to go lay that on the altar he didn't have a revelation he had religion he had a seed of discrepancy growing in him and he had a lot of religion and he thought I'll give God the best turnips I have the best tomatoes the best potatoes the best peas I'll go lay them on the Altar and God will be so pleased with me he'll say I'm the best Gardener there's ever been striving carnal striving religious striving I got to pray more got to read more got to do more got to go more got to be more I know I know I know people resist this I know you're PR you preach the message Believers and they can't even receive the Simplicity of what I'm saying right now because we are programmed by a church system gotta make one more trip gotta buy one more ticket gotta go to one more gotta go to one more convention gotta go to one more meeting gotta go to one and you can do all of that and be lost I gotta go to this conference in that conference and then and the other conference and I got on and on and on and on it goes that's not the kind of Labor that's going to bring you to the rest it's a faith work now should we read more yes brother bam tells us we should the prophet tells it he he said you could you could do a lot of things too much if you've never prayed too much we ought to pray more I'm telling you right now I can say that to everybody in this room I believe it always applies excuse me we can pray more we can pray more we should pray more we should miss a meal we should fast we should take this opportunity to set ourselves aside and draw close to the Lord but if you do that thinking that that alone is going to bring you to that place of rest in him you're going to get to the end of your fasting the end of your praying the end of your Bible reading still be bound come on some of my ameners are quiet and miserable until you understand that it's a faith work it was the lack of faith it was a lack of faith that caused the children of Israel not to enter the promise shall I read that to you we probably need to go on so that we can bring this to a landing here after a while don't we go to Hebrews 3 just a moment I don't want to skip too much but I want us to go to Hebrews 3 chapter 8 excuse me verse 8. I hope I'm not getting too far ahead Harden not your hearts hmm I don't like that kind of preaching it doesn't matter to me whether you like it or not but you got to keep your heart soft because if we let something Harden our heart and we can't hear God when he talks to us Harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of Temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my works hello 40 years the complete Jewish Bible that is translated by a friend of mine Dr David Stern of blessed memory he took that provocation from Hebrew I mean from Greek with a Hebrew mindset and called it the bitter quarrel it was a quarrel going on between the children of Israel and their God wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said they do always air in their heart not in their deeds your Deeds are the Overflow your words are the Overflow of your heart they do air in their heart are you still here and they have not what oh they knew the law it had been laid out for them they knew the rules but they didn't know the Lord they didn't know his ways you've got to make sure in all of your knowing that you learn to know the Lord it's more than knowing the rules it's more than knowing the original languages it's more than knowing sacred names you've got to know his ways and once you discover his ways you'll never doubt him again I'm telling you once you see the Lord's track record once your eyes are opened and and that that faithful God is revealed to you you won't struggle with trusting him anymore that'll be some rest on you on it how many of you want that rest I want my trust issues dealt with I want to be able to trust him and know that he always is out for my good Ness and if he requires anything of me he provides what I need to be obedient Grace Grace is provided for you and I so that we can be obedient to what God requires he's not asking anything from you and I that he doesn't give us so that we can offer it up that's the word that's the word wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said they do always air in their heart and they have not known my ways so I swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest 40 Years of carnal struggle they are close enough to the promised land to smell the grapes and God said you will not go in so I swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest take heed brethren now remember they are our examples First Corinthians chapter 10 Paul tells us we have this record because they are our example and I want everyone to take this warning very serious before we get ready to go and we're we're coming to a close take heed brethren lest there be any of you in an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the Living God but exhort one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin for We Are Made come on we are made partakers of Christ what good news if it's a tiny word isn't it but it's got a big impact in this verse if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast until the end it is vitally vitally vitally important that we hold our confidence through the trial through the heartache through the misunderstanding come on now I want you to go to Hebrews 4 2 in closing this is our job this is our responsibility and I won't have time to lay it out for you but I can at least read it to you this is our responsibility for unto us was the Gospel the good news preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not because they didn't try to obey it they tried to obey it they tried to keep the Commandments they tried to do what was right they tried they strive they strove they worked they labored but the word preached did not profit them and here's why not being it's a faith work it's more important than anything you can offer God today is your faith somebody said I I I I I just don't have you do have faith the Bible said you have faith to every man is given a Measure of Faith you have faith and your faith will grow if you use it but if you keep it and you don't invest it not being mixed with faith in them that did what that heard it all the children of Israel heard the same prophet what was his name Moses all the children of Israel heard the same Prophet Moses Moses was God's mouthpiece Moses had such a holy and perfect ministry that the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ is compared in the New Testament to the gospel Ministry to the ministry of Moses there will be a prophet that God will sin like unto Moses and that Prophet ended up being the Messiah so if you want to know what God thought about Moshe here's what he thought about him he thought that his life and Ministry was a beautiful type of God in flesh who would come down one day in our messiah in our savior the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua they all heard Moses and they heard the instruction and they heard the Commandments and they heard the law and they all tried with different various degrees of effort to keep what Moses had to say but the problem was many people put their trust in the law that means instruction by the way not rules and regulations the word law in scripture is instruction they put their confidence in the instruction instead of the end results the end results was to bring them to the promised land God wanted to give them Canaan he wanted to snatch it out from the hands of the wicked Pagan hoodlums that possessed the promise and wanted to give it to his children but you can't put your confidence in the instructions only people arguing about them now let me bring that up to some of you and I who have had a revelation that God sent an end time prophet that Prophet was a surrendered vessel to the Lord and we love love the ministry that God has used to help us get to where we are today I I hope that some of you appreciate my Ministry I'm not asking for amens I'm just saying it's only it's only automatic if it really is just who we are when somebody helps us on the way we love them and respect them and no one could have love and respect any more than I do for brother Branham but he was not infallible and he was not inerrant and so you can know all the quotes just like the Israelites knew all the instructions and still not go into the promised land because you didn't do your work your work wasn't just memorizing the quotes and running around the sign did you hear what Pastor Tate is going to get quiet here for a moment but did you hear what Pastor Tay said to us last Sunday he he said the key to the double portion anointing for Elisha was being able to recognize the homegoing of the Prophet Elijah he said if you can see me when I go what a silly thing to say my goodness Elisha couldn't even spend time in the outhouse because he knew that his key to having the mantle to having a portion of what Elijah had was he can't leave here without me seeing his departure I've got to see him leave I must recognize his leaving it's the same instruction given to us there in the Old Testament Moses my servant is dead in order for the children of Israel to follow their Joshua they had to recognize the ultimate Earthly demise of their Prophet Moses they had to see that he did what God called him to do and he finished the work he himself did not get to go into the Promised Land because he allowed the people to provoke him to anger when God said it's time to speak now it's not time to keep beating the rock you remember time to talk to The Rock Church I'm telling you it's time to talk to the Rock it's not time to go back and beat it all over again it's time to realize and recognize what you are so that you take a thought are you with me oh you see God sins prophets like Moses he sent to our generation a prophet voice a sign as promised it was it was to happen in the last days John the Baptist only fulfilling a portion of Malachi's prophecy there had to be another fulfillment of that because now the children's Hearts have to be turned back Jesus tells us you're right John the Baptist he did and and and his in other words yes there's a portion of that but there's something else you better not miss it here and we have seen it by the grace of God thank you Jesus but here's the problem with a sign when you're driving down these County Roads and you see a stop sign what do you do well you've got to slow down sure and then you stop let's say that together stop s t o p does it mean yield as sister Joyce was seemingly indicating no she wouldn't do that and where do we stop let me help you you need this I've watched some of you drive you don't stop in the middle of the intersection and say I stopped you stopped behind the white line you can't have the whole half into your car out there in the road for me to come by and take it off because I'm trusting you to stop if you're the one that's got the stop sign stop signs are important when God sends a sign it's important you believe God's still sending signs today I actually do I actually do I believe he's still sending signs today and when we see a sign especially of such importance and significance as the ministry of a prophet we certainly need to do what the sign says stop and Look Away to Jesus that was his ministry little bride I want you to see him he couldn't have a different commission than John the Baptist had to be the same kind of commission voice of one crying in the wilderness right and how did John come to the end of his Commission I must decrease he must increase how did Elijah come to the end of his commission if you see me when I go do you understand why that was important it was important because if they didn't see him called away somebody would believe that he would come back and continue his ministry they'd say he's just up in the woods there communing with the angels it was very important for Elisha to see him leave because that left no room for a return Ministry of Elijah you see I believe in return Ministry I believe that Elijah's return Ministry was Elisha anybody following me through my coded messages I do believe in return I believe that Elisha had just that a double portion of what Elijah had and I believe in a return Ministry today I believe the return Ministry of that Prophet is the bride yes sorry and I believe the trail is being written again but not by a single Indian chief this time it is being run it's a race that's being run by a people who will enter into the rest they will enter into the rest because they have learned that it's a faith work my my responsibility in this is not to fight about the quote and fight about the instruction my responsibility is to put my faith in that word because if I put my faith in the word that I hear I activate it in my life remember I told you you control the effectiveness of the word in your life it's your responsibility to say and I would do it if I were you before every service I'd say now Lord I'm here today to hear your word and I'm not here to hear it so that I can amen when somebody else needs it I'm here to aband my need I ain't gonna drop them amen bombs that we hear sometime and sometimes we joke about it when you know somebody else's toes are getting stepped on and you go amen because you really want them to hear it when you do that you're really making a mistake because you're shoveling the word that you may need in your own life so it's not just the verbal amen we're looking for it's the amen with the surrendered life and here's a problem that so many of my brethren have made they've made this terrible mistake they they they understood partially that every sign has a voice it does every sign that God sends talks it has a message it has something that God wants to say to us and so many jump out of their cars I better not see you doing this you're going to get run over you don't come to the stop sign and open up the door of your car and go run around the stop sign say oh stop signing stop sign the stop sign I know what that means a stop sign well yeah you stopped but you're focused on the sign and you probably failed to hear the voice because the sign came to cause us to stop and get still before the Lord so that we could hear the voice the voice of the sign said go all the way in my word keep your eyes on Jesus Christ he keeps all of his appointments come on look away to him the voice said you can have it all you can walk in the fullness of every bit of it but don't you be like that other generation who died after the provocation tempted me in the wilderness because they learned the quotes and they learned the instructions but they failed to do the faith work every service every service every time we read the Bible every time we hear a sermon on tape or on the app or wherever you hear your sermons we ought to take just a moment to say Lord let your word speak to my life today and I I already pull my faith up I pull it up right now and when I hear that word I'm going to attach my faith to that word I'm going to say Amen with my mouth I'm going to say Amen with my life because it's the only way that the word can be profitable and effective in me is for me to put my faith work in hello let's stand musicians are coming Moses was not inerrant or infallible to be that would have made him a perfect man there was only one he was emotional he made mistakes but when he spoke In The Name Of The Lord it was so and when the people added their faith to that word there was a generation that inherited the promised land do you remember but it was not the generation that originally heard the prophet it was their children the Bible said most of those who heard Moses died in the wilderness their carcasses bleaching and I'm just quoting the scripture their carcass is bleaching in the sun they they weren't lost God had a plan for them just like God has planned for people today don't worry about that Moses didn't go into the promised land either oh but there was another generation first of all let's say there was a Joshua and a Caleb you you feel it's all right did anybody turn red if they didn't I didn't succeed is that red oh he's getting a little pink there was a generation that missed out but how many of you know there was a generation who said we're going in 10 come back and had lots of gripes two come back with grapes and they said we can do this we can do this I know there are giants in the land but we can do this some said well we're just like little grasshoppers in their side and we'll never be able to take this land and we'll never get in we'll never bid to make it we'll never find the rest and we'll never inherit the promise because nobody told us we're going to have to put Giants out of the land in order to get in and get it maybe they didn't feel like the prophet gave them full disclosure but I'm telling you that if you get to the rest it's going to cost you something if you find that place of rest and confidence and Trust in his word so that you don't have to get shook up every time life throws you a wrench if you come to that and the bride is coming to that we're coming to a place of complete trust and confidence in the word and the word is going to help us out of every mess we're in that's why he sent the word he sent the word to heal us he sent the word to deliver us he sent the word to perfect us he sent the word to complete us and the word is going to take us over well we've got to put our faith work in we got to say that's my promise that's my I'm believing that I'm putting my confidence in that if you haven't started your faith Journey get on it because you can know a lot about the book but you've got to know the author you can know a lot about Christianity but you've got to know the Savior you've got to know the Messiah you've got to know the ways of God and here's the thing he's not over in the bushes hiding from you he wants to reveal himself oh if you're hungry to know him he's hungry to reveal himself to you he's got all the grease you need to unmat your eyes you can see him oh he's lovely to look upon he's beautiful to look upon do you believe that Benjamin come and lead us in a song of worship I want us to worship before we pray Hallelujah Hallelujah can you do it or you're too worn out can you worship him just another moment blessed be the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord oh thank you lamb thank you Lamb of God you are not a God created [Music] by human hands and you are not a god anymore you are not a God in Me [Music] and you are not a God created by human and you are not a god you are not a god

good times you are on your throne of our God [Music] You Are God Alone and right now and right now in the good times [Music] I know you started out to trust him has the enemy been successful in sowing a seed of doubt in your life if he has you can deal with it now you don't have to carry that doubt any longer you can be like the little man in the ministry of Jesus who said Lord I believe help thou my unbelief my faith is not perfect but it's active tell him it's not perfect but it's active you've never given me a reason to believe that you're going to fail me in anything in my life you've now I trust you I trust you there are times when I can't see clearly and I get scared but Lord I trust you remember that's not just the lip service but that's Surrender Your Life your will it's it's saying Lord I want to obey your word I want to serve you I want to go all the way with you if you're here let's just bow our heads for just a moment and if you're here and you would say I I want to trust him I want to surrender everything that I am to him and and I confess that there are times I get a little afraid fear Creeps in and and the way it gets a little blurry and I feel a little unsure my faith is not perfect but it's active if you feel that way I want you just to slip up your hand you can put it right back down God bless every hand in this building you weren't raising it to me you're raising it for him to see and can I tell you that he's not angry with you he's not angry with you because your faith is not perfect he's not angry with you for those times that that you wasted a service he's not angry with you but he's calling you to repentance he's calling you to accountability today and he's not doing it in Anger he's doing it in love he's saying I want you to step forward in faith I want you to move up in your faith and I want you to ask me he's really waiting at times on us to say Lord I can't see the way but I'm going to hold on to you I can't see the end there's there's some big uncertainties facing me right now but I I've got my my heart on you and my faith is on you let me pray with you right now as they just play that let me pray with every person who raised your hand father in the name of Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah we come today you saw every hand there's no one joining the church [Music] we're past that we're just raising our hands today to say there are times I get afraid but my faith is in you Lord you heard us confess that our faith is not perfect but you're perfect so our faith is in a perfect god with a perfect track record you have

angry I leave here dependent I depend on you Lord we as a people depend on your grace we depend on the way of Escape that you're building for us we depend on your sovereignty and we cling to your goodness we heard the brother say last night the first time he heard the song the goodness of God the goodness running after me he heard his children singing he said what are you singing I don't understand that and he said all of a sudden it dawned on him that the Bible said surely goodness and mercy would follow me all the days of my life and he began to sing at the song to your goodness is running after me your goodness is running after me your goodness is running after me Lord even when it doesn't look like it we want to thank you today that your goodness is always pursuing us and mercy is in our corner and Grace is chasing after us and we commit right now to to to putting our faith in this thing to invest no matter who's preaching we come to put our faith in because we know that activates your word in our life would you help us forgive us for the times that we've let a whole sermon go by and we've never put any faith in we're going to be more mindful Lord if you help us to deposit our faith we're going to start doing it on the way over here we're going to start doing it on the way over here we're going to start letting you know Lord I bring in my faith with me today I intend to see the word work in my life I intend to see the work change me from glory to glory and strength to strength and Faith to Faith I Surrender right now uh no one is looking this way just yet [Music] but I'd like to ask you are you here and sometimes you just feel like that the Lord is just angry with you he just must be really upset with you put your hand down more hands than I expected I don't know what in the world would give us that impression perhaps we're basing it on our circumstances maybe we're looking for a fairer situation but I want you to know that it's not the anger of God that you're facing today or you'd be dust he said every opportunity to squish you like an ant isn't that the truth [Music] and yet he protected you and he ran after you he saved you from destruction again and again and again and even when you break his heart it's not anger that comes he's just waiting on you to repent where we're entering a season of teshava we're entering a season in preparation for the fall feast 40 days of repentance [Music] it's just a time that the nation of Israel the people of God foreign I mean the spiritual Nation they just start turning their hearts toward the day of atonement first the head of the year and Sukkot Tabernacles and so the theme of the month of elul forward we're entering into that time of just a heightened sense of repentance or just saying Lord before you I repent for those times that I have not trusted for those times that instead of faith I have responded in fear every time I have thought that you are angry with me when your word clearly says the fire of your eyes is your fiery passion and love for me and you would move Heaven and Earth you've proven it time and time again you would move Heaven and Earth to come to my rescue so I just repent right now of every wrong approach of every wrong concept of every wrong definition of who you are I have let Church entity Define you instead of your word and your faithful record in my life I Repent of that help me I Repent of that right now you are not that God you are not that God you call me your wife you call me your own you said I could wear your name and I Just Surrender those
