TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer [Music] is surrendering our mind to the word that's what makes the big difference that's the great mystery right Christ in you the hope award hello I'm pastor Stephen Shelley of the New Hope revival ministries in Smith Station Alabama and I'm coming to you today on behalf of brother Eric Erickson and the entire staff of the gospel channel I'm so thankful to the Lord for the Ministry of the gospel channel and I know that many of you watching this program today are so blessed to be able to turn on the television and hear the gospel of Jesus Christ being spoken being announced we could say with power with anointing and with unction twenty-four hours a day and I want you to know that it's not possible without your gift without your partnership without your offerings and most importantly without your prayer I'm just going to invite you to partner with the gospel channel as a prayer warrior and as a giver as God lays it on your heart I don't mention that too much when we're together because I won't of course emphasize the word of God and the effect that the Word of God can have in your life but it would be a terrible thing if you came to your television set one day and you turned it on and there was no signal there was no gospel channel it would be a real shame and I believe that many of you would miss the gospel channel tremendously by the grace of God he is providing and he is making away but there are times in the year when things get really tough and so you know I'm I'm an outsider so to speak I don't work for the gospel channel but I feel like I'm partners with them and I feel like I'm part of the gospel channel family and so on behalf of my family I want to ask you to continue in prayer and to ask the Lord if he would have you to so financially into the ministry so that the true can continue to be broadcasted into your home not only to your home but even on your portable device you can go on the World Wide Web and you can stream the gospel channel well it's just a delight to be with you again today we have had a couple of sessions together already on the subject of schemes and devices and we use as a theme for our study so far the scripture in 2nd Corinthians chapter 2 and verse 11 it says lest Satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices and I know that that many people really do not like the idea of studying darkness and that's not what we're going to do today we're not going to study darkness but what we are going to do is expose the enemy for who he really is it's the will of God that you and I as overcoming children of the king understand the schemes and the devices of our enemy if we are able to anticipate how the enemy is going to show up how he's going to move in a particular situation then we can move offensively instead of defensively we can move first we can be on the cutting edge before the enemy strikes the one thing that we know about our enemy is he only has one bag of tricks and he just keeps pulling them out and using them over and over again the characters vary the circumstances may vary a little bit but the enemy continues to operate in the same cycles the same schemes over and over again what if we can learn them what if we can learn our web to combat the enemy and what if we can learn to discern the next move that the enemy is about to make then by the grace of God we can rise up and cut him off at the pass lest at the scripture said lest he have an advantage over us we'd like to make sure that the enemy cannot take advantage of any of God's children I truly believe that the answers we seek are in the Word of God and as we closed our study together the last time we were reading in 2nd Corinthians chapter 11 and verse 14 in the amplified version it says and it is no wonder for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light I'm telling you that really exposes one of the most significant schemes of the enemy he always comes under cover he always comes in a masquerade you know I think we mentioned when we were together the last time if you're looking for the devil to come in a red suit and a band pitchfork and a pointed tail you're never gonna see the devil show up in your life in that kind of a costume he's going to masquerade himself all right he's going to come as an angel of light he's going to present something to you that is so shiny that is so beautiful that is so enticing that if you're not careful you will swallow what the enemy offers hook line and sinker before you even realize that it was the enemy who was peddling whatever this shiny promise was all about it was the enemy doing it and so one of the things we can remember is watch for the enemy to move against through deception it's his job you know the one thing about being deceived is you don't know you're deceived and that's something that the enemy certainly takes advantage over and I find that the enemy becomes particularly successful in the life of a Christian when we begin to fall into that place of indifference passivity and prayerlessness when we are not watchful in prayer the enemy certainly is able to take advantage our enemy the devil is defeated he is a defeated antagonist but he will not just lay down and play dead he knows that because of the declaration of our Lord on the cross it is finished that he cannot change or manipulate the plan of salvation he cannot steal the gift of God's love from your life but he wants to do everything that he can to paralyze you to hold you back from stepping into the fullness of who God created you to be our strength is in the Lord our strength is in the Word of God our strength is in the blood of Jesus Christ and we need to use that in our daily battles we can win every daily battle with our enemy by recognizing that in order to fight Satan we must find him in the realm of the Spirit and there's a scripture that we may look at even later in our study together but I think it would be good to look at it right now because we're describing the arena by which the enemy works his his deeds you know he works in the natural realm there's no doubt about it but he works from the spiritual realm he he sits in the spiritual realm and he operates through the physical realm by using the natural circumstances of our life he's not only the great xever but he definitely is the great manipulator here's a scripture that I think is really good to remember Ephesians 6:11 put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil and here's what I want you to remember for we wrestle not against flesh and blood see here the Apostle is is letting us know that when we respond when we fight against the enemy when we war against him through the blood of Jesus Christ we must not war in the natural realm we must war in prayer in praise and in intercession it's not by for instance the enemy will use someone that you love and so you're recognizing that this is not my loved one this is the enemy that's trying to use them but quite often we go to war with our loved one and without really remembering that the enemy is just taking advantage of our loved one listen the devil will use you he will use me if I'm yielded to him if I'm not prayerful if I'm not vigilant if I'm not watchful and aware the enemy will use whoever he can use but in order to defeat the enemy we can't go fighting our loved one we have to fight in the realm of the Spirit every daily battle with the enemy can be won if we learn that our victory comes by warring in the realm of the Spirit again how do we do that through prayer through praise and through intercession these are the ways that we can operate against the enemy from the realm of the Spirit and we need to let our loved ones off the hook you know if we recognize that the enemy is using them while we might war them in love but we're not going to be able to defeat the enemy by fighting against our loved one or against our neighbor or our co-worker or someone in the church whoever it is that we discern that the enemy is using this is not a battle of flesh and blood Ephesians 6:12 but against principalities see that takes it in to the realm of spirit principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places none of these things are of the earth realm or the natural realm they manifest in the natural but their origin is in the realm of the Spirit sometimes we refer to that realm where the Prince of the power of the air rules as the second heaven listen again its principalities powers the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places all of those descriptions of what we wore against and all of them in the realm of the Spirit verse 13 wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand now we'll look at these verses of Scripture a little later in our studies together but I just felt like it was important for you to be able to understand what do we mean when we say you're able to overcome and to win your daily battles with the enemy by recognizing that in order to fight Satan we must fight him in the realm of the Spirit so I hope that helped you a little bit spiritual things the Bible said are spiritually discerned not figured out by human reasoning you know we we just do a quick analysis of what we feel what we see what we experience sometimes we fail to recognize wait a minute this is not just a conflict between coworkers this isn't just a little human striving in a family but there is a principality behind this there is a devil with an agenda behind this and you know that can strike fear in in the hearts of a folk it certainly can but it need not you need not be afraid because if you know that you have been washed in the blood of the Lamb sanctified by the washing of the water of the word and filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire you have every right that qualifies you to use every weapon that God has stored for us placed for us in his arsenal you just pull it down and use it when you need to understand that the enemy will sometimes use human reasoning to get us focused on one another and so we're going after one another we're we're gossiping you know about somebody and my there there there just this and that in the other and we get some big stir going and and we think that by telling it we're gonna we're going to alleviate the problem but but often if we could just discern a few moments you know a close down our mind a minute you know we get all these thoughts tossing and turning in our mind and just begin to think on the on the situation and see if the Lord will give you some discernment to help you understand hey wait a minute this isn't just people problems there is a devil behind this there is a demonic agenda behind what's going on between myself and that individual and if it is demonic then it originates in the realm of the spirit and so the battle the victory must be won in the realm of the Spirit if we win the battle through prayer and praise and intercession we can rest shirred that the victory will quickly manifest in the natural realm the earth realm where we live our lives spiritual things remember are spiritually discerned they're not reasoned out by human understanding and in order to recognize and remain alert to we must recognize we must learn to recognize and remain alert to cycles to patterns to paradigms in attacks from the enemy or what are these things these are ways and means that the enemy uses to war against your life and what he does often is he keeps as we mentioned earlier he keeps pushing against us pushing against us pushing against us and every one of those attacks has a root there's a root behind it there's a cause behind it the enemy has found access to your life he's found a way to distract you from serving the Lord with peace you know that's really what the thief is out to do to disturb your peace when we when we greet one another from the Hebrew language we greet one another Shalom and Shalom is peace but it's it's also a question how is your peace how is your peace and you would answer Shalom Shalom my peace is full my peace is complete and I want you to know the only way that we could truly answer the question how is your peace how is your rest the only way that we could really answer that it's complete it's perfect it's finished is by knowing who we serve by knowing what this is living on the inside of our spirit man the life of Jesus Christ and I'm telling you when the life of Jesus Christ is living in you and manifesting through you you have peace oh yes there will be a tax or yes there will be on sloths of the enemy against your life but if you pause and discern there's a route behind this and I need to find that route and cut it off in the authority of Jesus Christ so we're watching spiritually we're Watchmen on the wall we must be alert to how the enemy moves and operates against us we're watching four cycles you know a cycle is it gives us the idea of something circular it has a beginning point and it continues forward on on on on and it's it rotates right back to where it begins and in most of the time what happened it starts right over and I've watched the enemy create cycles in my own life in areas maybe of anxiety or depression all of which originate from the same spot from the same place usually a thought process that opens up in my mind one that I have many many many times defeated absolutely ripped it down in the authority of Jesus Christ but that doesn't mean that the enemy will never use that again he'll pick it up he'll dust off his weapons he'll come right back his bag of tricks he'll loose them against you again starting in the same place the same thought process and that will cycle all the way around and many of us could look back over our lives I've even heard people who became very aware and very discerning of how the enemy has operated against them and they've even recognized cycles of three years our cycles of five years our cycles of seven years when the enemy comes back around with the same lies with the same tricks if we can recognize that we have authority by Jesus Christ to cut off that cycle so that the enemy cannot use it again the Bible said that because of the anointing the yoke is destroyed not just broken but destroyed the anointing of God in your life has the power to destroy the yoke that the enemy would like to place on your shoulder and what is the purpose of a yoke - to control you the enemy likes to place a yoke on our shoulder so that he can turn us in whatever direction he desires to turn us and how does he do that usually through our emotions but because of the anointing the yoke is destroyed if you can recognize that it's the enemy putting this heavy burden on you and not the Lord and you can claim lay hold of in faith the anointing that's working in your life by the Holy Ghost you can see that yoke not only broken but destroyed blown to smithereens if you will in so many timing little pieces and fragments that the enemy will not ever be able to glue it back together and use it against you again hallelujah that's the victory that Jesus is making available to us if we'll surrender our will and live the God life the life of Jesus Christ so we've got to remain alert we need to watch for cycles for patterns and even paradigms which we'll talk about another time so it's very important to remember that the victory that we win in each of those situations is a victory that must be maintained it's not one time and never again often because the enemy will just come back and and change if you detail he'll just change a few circumstances that the actors in the drama will be changed up a little bit the tone of something will be a little different and he'll try the very same old thing against you so if God gives you not if when you claim the victory that God has given you in your life you've got to maintain that victory and again how do we do that by the end first of all where do we do that we do that in the realm of the spirit now how do we get into the realm of the Spirit we get into the realm of the Spirit through prayer through praise through intercession so it's not only is prayer and praise and intercession and meditating on the Word of God etc not only are these weapons that we can use to stay alert against our enemy but they're also doorways that we can use to move into the realm of the Spirit where the battle is won and where the victory is maintained thank God it is possible how because Jesus is the victor he is the victor he has defeated the enemy on our behalf and it is now our responsibility to appropriate and to maintain that victory he's done it the work is done the battle is won so to speak but it is our responsibility to appropriate that victory and to maintain that victory and we do that by entering as often as possible into the spirit realm where we're living out of the inner man instead of reacting from the outer man or from the mind the will and the emotions now I want to talk to you for just a minute about strongholds because the Bible talks to us about strongholds in our life we know what a stronghold is in in the natural a stronghold that word is translated as a castle or a fortress and also it's translated as anything on which one relies or depends on so it is a fortified place that Satan can use to exalt himself in your life I like to say it this way a stronghold is any argument that sets itself up against the knowledge of God but God has given us victory over every stronghold over every fortress that the enemy would raise up the word stronghold is derived from the greek word echo and one of the meanings of echo is to have possession of the mind and the emotions let me tell you something that's what Satan desires he desires to be able to manipulate your mind and your emotions and many many times he doesn't have much of a vowel because we just surrender that authority to him very very quickly you see a mind that is stayed on the Lord he will keep those in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on the Lord we could say you will walk in Shalom Shalom if your mind is fixed on the Lord in the same way that you know how to to dial your channel you know exactly how to pick up this signal either by your Sky box or by satellite you know exactly how to dial it in it's not an automatic thing you know what number to look for and what numbers to turn past to get to the number you're looking for it's deliberate in other words and so is this grace of setting our mind on the things of the Lord oh let me tell you in this hour that we're live in the devil house he has voices everywhere and tons of distractions life is like a big carnival with everybody barking come over this way and let me sell you this and come over that over here and let me let me offer you a deal you can't refuse and this is how it gets some time even even spiritually the enemy's trying to lure us away after some craziness pull our attention away get us caught up in politics and get us caught up in all kinds of issues that are distracting really to the child of God especially if we're looking to maintain victory so it's important that you and I take possession of our mind and our emotions and we do that by putting on the mind of Jesus Christ by taking his mind we are exalting him as Lord and as Victor and giving him the the position of being able to to steer to move in our will in our mind and in our emotions let me tell you something when your enemy takes possession of your mind by giving you lying thoughts that you embrace that you receive I believe every lie that the enemy whispers in your ear needs to be rejected every one of them every one of them when he tells you you're ugly you're unattractive you'll never have a companion you need to tell the devil that he is a liar that God doesn't make junk that God knows exactly what he's doing in your life and and if indeed you're a candidate to have someone he has the right person set aside for you or he tells you you're a failure or you're so unworthy that you could never really be a child of God I don't know what the enemy is telling you but I know he won't stop until you stop him I know that he won't quit until you force his hand and the only way that we can do that get in that place in the spirit not in the natural not not trying to fight this thing with flesh and blood but enter in with prayer enter in with praise and worship let God direct your prayer with intercession let him give you strategy I'm telling you God if you tuned in to that spirit realm you may find the Lord's voice telling you to do something he may give you leadership he's not going to lead you to do anything that's against his word I can assure you of that right now the only thing that God is bound by is by his word if he has spoken it to us if he has declared his word to us he's not going to deviate he's not going to vary there from that word not even one little tiny jot or tittle or IO de he's gonna stay right on that word so if you feel like you're being instructed to do something against the Word of God it's not God talking to you you need to be able to discern the difference in the voice that is not God if it's telling you to do something against the word but he may give you some strategy he may tell you to do something you know I remember years ago when when I was pastoring a church in another state as really a young man barely barely a young man you know just an older teenager really but but moving toward 20 19 20 years old something like that and my mother who was really raised me as a single parent my parents were married but they divorced when I was five years old and so my mother raised me as a single parent and now God had moved me from my home to another state and he had given me instructions of what I was to do in that area and oh it was a little bit lonely I didn't know a lot of people in that area I was making it by the grace of God but in reality my mother was very lonely and she missed me being around and so she decided that that she would like to move to the place that I was living the state that I was living in but she'd been working for quite a few years at the bank and it looked impossible it didn't look like there was any way in the world that she could start over in a new place but you know we began to pray and there was a one branch of the bank that my mother was working for at the time in the city where God had moved me and one day I had been in prayer and the Lord spoke to me now you may just turn off the television and you may say that's a nutcase preacher but I'm gonna tell you the Lord spoke into my spirit and I can say that with boldness even as crazy as it sounds to some people because I know there are people watching this program that understand what it means to discern that in internal voice of God the leadership of the Spirit of God and he told me that I should anoint a rock I said oh my what is this you know what kind of leadership is this that I should pray over a rock and anoint it with oil and that I should go up and take it to the to the branch of the bank in my new city where I was living and put that in the in the on the property somewhere and do it as a memorial that I believed that God could open the door for my mother to have a job at that Bank even though her initial inquiries had made it sound like an impossible transfer I said alright Lord hope nobody sees me but I'll do exactly what you have put in my heart I know that it's you because there's nothing in me that would have ever thought about doing something like that so I took that rock I I poured oil over that rock I prayed over that rock and I said Lord let this rock be a symbol of my faith that I know that you're a God of the possible with men things are impossible but with you all things are possible let this rock be a testimony that I Steven Shelley believe that even though the enemy has sealed up the doors and every person she has spoken to said it's not going to happen I believe that you oh god you are going to open the door for my mother to transfer to this bank and not only that let it be a testimony that I believe it's going to be in the next 30 days now when I said that 30 days I didn't hear that in in my inner voice the inner voice of the Lord speaking to me my faith said that I believe the Lord told me to take the rock to a North Iraq where to put the rock and I believe that he inspired me to call it a memorial of my faith but when I said and and let it be known it will happen in the next 30 days it shocked me that was my faith talking and so I decided the best way to get that job done was to do it and then tell some good Holy Ghost fill people what I had done that's a little bit of accountability and so I I'll never forget it I drove up to the bank and I and I got out and I had it in my pocket and I I walked around back and forth it's a wonder they hadn't arrested me for loitering but I found just the right spot in the front of the bank under some shrubbery in the landscape and some pine straw up against there and I thought if I put it under here it'll stay here no one will think it's there by mistake they won't see it I'll fix it just good so I walked over kind of you know casually whistling or something and and placed it in there and I felt I can tell you this I know it must sound silly some of you but I could feel the presence of the Lord I could feel the presence of the Lord confirming to me you know it's like God saying that's right that's right son you'd be obedient because he had given me this strategy in the realm of the Spirit and so I did it and I'm telling you I've got to make a long story short but I want you to know it was not only less than 30 days it was less than 5 days it was about 3 days that a phone call came and the answer was we are going to change this rule we're going to make you the exception to the rule we're going to let you transfer even though they had told her there's nothing to wait to hear it's done the decisions made now all of a sudden without her ever calling back she gets the phone call and they said not only that we were going to break another rule we're going to let you transfer at your same level at your same position at your same salary and there's some training that needs to be done when you get there and we're gonna give you a bonus for helping take some of this understanding of the equipment and the software to the bank there they've not had anybody to help them and so we're going to give you a bonus for helping for being able to help and train because of the knowledge that you have in less than 30 days everything was settled the moving truck had already come and in less than 30 days my mother was living in the same city that I was living so sometimes we enter in in prayer we enter in in praise we enter in intercession and sometimes God drops a little strategy he drops I hope for you it won't be as as what would some people would think silly I hope it'll be something you know that that sounds better that looks better feels more important for you but God knew me he knew what it would take he knew that that was going to stretch me a little bit and what if I told you that I have used that strategy more than one time in faith just in faith it's not in the Bible the Bible didn't save you an honor and go and stand and make a testimony although God is a God of memorial and he's a God of remembrance but he didn't say I'll do this and that but you know what I have heard that unction that inspiration and I have moved in faith more than one time and I have seen God work let me give you this example the Bible says that God is Jehovah Rapha he is the healer the Bible says in Isaiah that he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes we are healed that is the promise of the word of God but in the New Testament it says are there any sick if so let them call for the elders of the church to come and anoint with oil and pray over them and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and if they've done any sins they'll be forgiven that's a New Testament promise if healing is already provided in the atonement why is it necessary to call the elders why is it necessary to lay hands on them why is it necessary to anoint them with oil this is because God is asking us to demonstrate our faith if you really believe I am Jehovah Rapha if you really believe I am the Lord God that heals all of your diseases this is the method by which you can access in faith that promise of healing called the elders of the church and so that's why we invite people call the prayer line call and leave a message if it's not during our open business hours so to speak then leave the message of what you need us to pray about if you don't mind give us your name and your location you don't have to give us any more personal information than that and tell us what your need is or send us an email because in doing so it's a little different than if you're in a local church of course you're going to do that but we hear from people all the time who don't have a local church family and so today by calling in your prayer requests you're doing what the scripture said call for the elders of the church and if we were there we would be more than happy to anoint you with oil but I believe that that act of faith calling on the elders is a way of accessing the promise so many times even though the victory is ours God leads us or instructs us to move in something that will demonstrate our faith to demonstrate that we believe that God is indeed a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him if there is a stronghold in your life a place that the enemy has used against you a situation that the enemy has used against you over and over and over and every time he does he's successful it continues to be an issue then I could almost without a doubt I can say that is a stronghold and God wants to give you victory and deliverance of every stronghold in your life I tell you that these weapons that God has have give has given us our mighty through God to the pulling down of every stronghold any place where we have allowed Satan to reign in our mind to control our thoughts can be considered a stronghold and like all other spiritual battles a stronghold is not pulled down by carnal methods it's only pulled down by spiritual weapons and in the realm of the spirit I'll tell you let me give you an example of a stronghold that the enemy is using on a lot of people in the body of Christ today it's in proverbs chapter 13 and verse 12 and it says Hope deferred makes the heart sick Hope deferred makes the heart sick that word sick if you look at it it means to have an unstable mind Hope deferred makes the mind unstable when you look at that word deferred Hope deferred here it does not simply mean delayed now what we often take the scripture to mean is that when we pray and we pray and we pray and we don't see the answer immediately to our prayer and we pray and we pray sometimes we pray for years without seeing the real fruition or fulfillment of what we've been believing God for and we do it for many years with faith standing on the word standing on the promise believing God but if the enemy can move in and start reminding you heal heal start chanting in your ear well do you think God's ever gonna answer your prayer you think God really loves you haven't you prayed yes and this an unselfish request where is God now aren't you tired of saying the same silly prayer over and over again with no results I'm telling you he'll lie he will he will come with every kind of creative thought to discourage you from prayer to make you feel like God's forgotten God is forsaken there's this delay it's more than I can stand but this word deferred here doesn't just mean delayed a promise that has been delayed or an answer to prayer has been delayed it actually translates seized hope that has been seized a promise an answer to prayer that has been seized which means violently taken ahold of doesn't that sound like the enemy didn't that sound like the original kleptomaniac the thief cometh not but for to steal to kill and to destroy it is his great desire to silently seize all hope in your life it is the enemy's desire to violently lay hold on every promise that God has ever made to you through his word it is the enemy's desire to paralyze your faith and your hope so that you give up and you operate in Hope deferred which leads to an unstable mind too unstable thinking this scripture tells me that the enemy is not just simply planning a delay he doesn't just simply want to delay a promise but he desires to steal to seize the promise he's after every promise in your life every dream every breakthrough that you've been crying out to God for he comes to steal and to kill and to destroy if Satan can seize and steal your hope he builds a structure of death over your life and then he howls in your in your in your ear he howls in your inner man and and listen he'll try to convince you there is no God not only is there no answer coming to your prayer there is no God I want you to know he doesn't just tell people outside the church those lies in fact he's more actively telling people who believe in God he more actively fighting against the believer seizing our dreams our hopes our promises reminding us of words and death structures that have been spoken over our lives even from childhood maybe someone has spoken over us you'll never amount to anything you'll never be anything you're just a failure you're just a loser well I want you to know that that through the power of Jesus Christ by recognizing the schemes and devices of our enemy by utilizing the weapons that God has given us in this holy spirit arsenal we can defeat the thief we can stop the enemy in his tracks and we can hold on to our promises hallelujah I'm feeling excited we can hold onto our hope we can let our faith be strengthened and be strong and instead of running from the promise we can we can run the devil out instead of you and I throwing our hope away and throwing our promise away and running back and hiding somewhere we can strike fear in the enemy and let him know greater is He that is in me than he that is in the world he doesn't listen the devil doesn't want you to have a vision of Hope he doesn't want you to believe that God cares about the personal details of your life he'll try to convince you if he can't convince you there is no God he'll try to convince you that God's too busy to care about you he's a liar and the father of all lies he wants to build structures of death over your life by stealing your vision by killing your dreams by taking your hope from you these structures are not only built over individual lives but I've watched the enemy build death structures over entire communities over entire congregations over entire families convincing everyone who's a part of that community that family that church group convincing them that they're never going to see the breakthrough that God has promised well I want you to know somebody's got to stop the enemy somebody has got to be aware of how he operates and somebody has got to rise up in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah and stand on the promises of God we must do that because those death structures are holding back the harvest those death structures that the enemy likes to build those strongholds those castles that he likes to raise up as fortresses that seem almost impenetrable you you can't penetrate them you can't break them down but I want you to know you can if you come into agreement with God's Word you can't do it your way you can't do it with human reasoning or carnal ideas but in the realm of the Spirit God can show you the route of how this death structure has been built over your life over your finances over your health over your church community it can go over your business it I tell you when the enemy is successful in building that thing it's death to your vision its death to your success its death to your hope its death to your faith but I'm telling you Jesus he did something to death didn't he he conquered death in every shape in every form in every fashion in any way that death desires to operate in you Jesus paid the victory to conquer the enemy and including the enemy of death whatever is not releasing life in you must be recognized as possibly releasing death and so we called it a death structure it's is that the enemy keeps using and you keep believing it's situations that the enemy keeps setting up in your life and instead of being able to finally recognize this as the enemy and doing something about it we just kind of you know fall into the same trap over and over again into the same addiction over and over again because he comes to steal he comes to kill he comes to destroy let me read you in the time that we have left let me read Romans chapter seven verse five if you will when we were living in the flesh our mere physical lives this must be in the amplified the sinful passions that awakened that were awakened and aroused up by what the law makes sin were constantly operating in our natural powers in our bodily organs in the sensitive appetites and wills of the flesh so that we bore fruit for death the enemy wants us bearing bearing death fruit instead Jesus wants us to be bearing life fruit and not only living fruit but the living fruit of the Spirit the life of Jesus Christ when we're caught up in our own passions in our own physical lives you know we're just completely focused on on bills or human relationships and and you know what's going on on the job and what's happening with the mortgage sure we have to definitely we have to take care of these things we have to give them some of our attention of course we do but the enemy wants us to get so caught up in those things that we have no time to develop the spiritual man the inner man listen Jesus Christ longs to have fellowship with you he longs to have relationship with you so that you can produce fruit of spirit fruit of life and not death I want to pray with you right now father I thank you for this opportunity that you have given me today to speak words of truth some of it may not have been easy to hear some of it may be new material for someone watching the program may be coming from a background that that has not dealt with some of these schemes and cycles of the enemy but yet I believe that there are those watching this program right now whose hearts have been somewhat awakened by what they have heard today and they're beginning to understand they're beginning to see how the enemy builds these structures and strongholds and fortresses of death over our life I pray that they will also understand the victory that you have given us and the weapons that you have given us to defeat the enemy so I come against in the authority of Jesus Christ strongholds and death structures in the lives of believers I thank you Lord that you said in your word we shall know the truth and the truth shall make us free I'm asking that by the truth going out today by the enemy being exposed today through the Word of God I'm praying and believing that this truth will penetrate the darkness in somebody's life right now that you Oh God will give them strength to pull the loose thread and to begin to unravel what the enemy has been using against them Lord I want us to be able to recognize that the enemy comes to steal our hope to seize our dreams to take and hijack our promises but Lord would you give grace right now to every viewer would you release anointing to every viewer right now who comes to you in faith believing I know they're skeptics that we'll watch I know there are unbelievers also who will watch but Lord to those who can believe your word to those who can take you at your word I asked today that you will activate this word that they have heard today and that you will use it to execute victory and deliverance over death structure and stronghold and paradigms that the enemy has used to keep them back I say freedom in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I declare that Jesus is the victor in my life and I announce him to be the victor in your life Lord we ask you to come and confirm your word in the lives of those watching this program right now and we ask it in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah a man and the saints of God around the world said a man he is your victor he didn't just come to give me the victory he came also that you might have the victory all believe on him put your faith and confidence in him today determine to search the scripture and let the Spirit of God awaken you to the truth of the enemy's schemes and devices and may God give you grace to raise up every weapon that the Lord Jesus has made available for you and I to win this battle pray for the gospel channel that God will prosper them and expand them and pray for new hope revival ministries as well thank you for your attention thank you for letting us share with you what God is placed so deeply in our hearts and though we may not know all of you we may have never seen you in the natural I can say and mean it from the bottom of my heart I love you because you are desiring the things of God and that makes us brothers and sisters in Christ god bless you bye bye for now [Music] [Applause] [Music]
