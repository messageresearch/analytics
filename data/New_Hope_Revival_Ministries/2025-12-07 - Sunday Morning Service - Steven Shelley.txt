His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns, and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood. And his name is called the Word of God. And the armies, listen, and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen, white as clean. And out of his mouth goeth a sharp two-edged sword, and with it a sharp sword, excuse me, and with it he should smite the nations, and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, and he treadth the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. Listen. And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Sing that verse again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

Does anybody have a unspoken prayer questions by the uplifting of the hand? There's needs all over this room. Do you have anything? continue to remember sister Williams and brother Paul Drown and any of the other requests that have come that have been mentioned over the last few weeks but particularly believing God for complete miracles remember Jacob who's been having a difficult time health-wise but he's better doing better now but he's on shift today pray for him that God will help and strengthen him and many others who just need a mighty touch from God. &gt;&gt; So many things. It's already done. It's already done. &gt;&gt; The battle is over and victory is won. done. It's already done. I'm already healed. I'm already healed. [music] The battle is over and victory is won. It's already done. My family [singing] is [music] sealed. My family is sealed. The battle is over [singing] and victory is won. It's already done. [music] Oh, I'm already [singing] healed. The battle is over and victory is won. It's already done. Brother Daniel, would you come today? [music] It's already done. It's already done. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; The battle is over and victory. Oh, it's &gt;&gt; Oh, [music] yes, it is. This morning, I told the Lord if he wanted me to share what he spoke to me with you that Joshua would ask me to come pray this morning. And so, Joshua asked me to come pray. So, I'm going to tell you what the Lord said this morning to me while I was standing by the bush. The anointing was falling on Brother Shel. The anointing was falling on us all. I trust you could feel Jesus passing you because we've learned recently that the anointing is a person. Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. So, as brother Benjamin was leading us, I heard the Lord say, "You need to stop in that brook that's praising me this morning, and you need to pick up some stones. You you you've thrown them carelessly. You've thrown them without purpose." and your enemy. Hear me. How many of you has ever faced a giant before? You got scared and you you went off a little too quick or you threw without him backing it. This morning, we're going to hear the word of the Lord this morning and it's going to raise our faith. But if you don't have anything to project at the enemy, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You got to have something in your hand, saints. Fill up whatever the giant has. Right? We heard this a few years ago that he stopped to pick up five stones cuz David had four brother or Goliath had four brothers. I'm sorry. I'm so excited under this anointing. Just don't want you to miss it this morning. The enemy has a soft spot about that big. I don't care that he's 10 foot tall. I don't care that he has 14inch feet. I don't care this morning. He's got a soft spot about as big as a mouse. All you've got to know is that by hearing the word of God, you receive revelation that the projectile will hit the target &gt;&gt; and you'll never have to deal with that giant again after today. &gt;&gt; I believe. Let's pray together. Heavenly Father, we love you this morning. [laughter and gasps] &gt;&gt; Thank you for coming to be with us today, Lord. Thank you for sending a word in due season to help us overcome. May we not milly mouth around, Lord, with these things that we faced year in and year out. But may we be victorious by your grace and with your faith, Lord, with the revelation of your word, may we be overcomers today, Lord. May the things that we faced in our mind and the battles that we fought, may it be laid down for the last time, Lord. No more false starts. No more journeys around the mountain, Lord. Only up and into you today. &gt;&gt; We want to come up and into you, Lord. We want to take our place at your side. We want to give you our crowns, Lord. We know that you're the only one that deserves and earned it, Lord. We've done nothing to deserve or earn what you've given to us. We know that we can't be good enough. We know that there's no righteousness found in us, Lord. We know that adhering to the word is because we love you and we believe you, Lord, and that you never change. So, we ask you to speak the words of life that will take deep anchor in our heart that will give us the strength to raise our sling above our head and spin, Lord. &gt;&gt; And in the name of Jesus, &gt;&gt; we'll have our victory. bring him down. Thank you, Lord. Thank you for taking those stripes for our healing, Lord. For every need in the body today, for brother Paul. Lord, we think of him and don't know that I've ever met him, Lord, but he's a brother. And I ask you, Lord, may the wings of faith pass by his place today. &gt;&gt; Oh, we thank you, Jesus. Thank you for victory today. In the name of Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's already done. &gt;&gt; Standing on it. It's already done. [music] The battle is over and victory is won. It's already done. Let's sing that one [music] more time. It's already done. [music] It's already done. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; The battle is over and victory is won. It's already done. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand clap of praise this morning as you're seated. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. Brother IAS and Austin, would y'all mind to come help me with the offering and go to the people? We're going to invite Brother Cade to sing.

The wonderful presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; If every church and every service was the same. If every service in every church was the same, somehow along the way, it would lose its uh attractiveness and we would begin to take it for granted. Aren't you glad to know that we can let the spirit of the Lord move and have his way &gt;&gt; and he creates a uniqueness in every service &gt;&gt; and uh it makes us want to come back the next time to see what the Lord will do. I understand church order and I understand that brother Brandham brought it three times and as it went along it it got tighter and and tighter and I understand the purposes for it. But I also know that he kept saying to us, "Every church is sovereign." And and we're not in a in a denomination of any kind. And we we don't even want to be identified with those who are sort of building a denomination around the message. &gt;&gt; We're identified with the word. &gt;&gt; And uh I love freedom. I'm not looking for for uh you know, wildness or or um you know, someone trying to draw our attention or something like that. But I love that God has given us a place &gt;&gt; where we can sing. If we want to sing for 40 minutes &gt;&gt; and worship him as long as we're not performing, but we're doing it unto him, we can. And we don't get a head we don't get a call from headquarters &gt;&gt; that says you went a little long in the worship. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. The L L the Lord spoke into my heart like he does yours many, many times. But he's never ever yet told me, you worship me too much. &gt;&gt; The Bible said he lives in he inhabits the praises of his people. And a lot of people think that praise is just, you know, about giving unto the Lord. But we've learned through the years biblically that there are many, many purposes for our praise and worship. And sometimes it's actually giving liberty to another realm, to another host. And and they're moving in ways that we don't even understand. Sometimes it feels like there's a little waring going on. And I want you to know that that's over our heads all the time. We're just not aware of it. the kingdom of darkness and the kingdom of light advancing and moving and and uh you know withdrawing and pushing in. And I I'm just glad that we can uh know even when we don't know exactly what's happening, we can know that something is being accomplished. And I just want I know I kind of stumbled around, but I just wanted to tell you I feel so uh good today that something was accomplished &gt;&gt; in what what we were doing unto the Lord. I'm ready to hear the word. &gt;&gt; I I'm looking forward to what God will say to us today. There's something moving among us. I believe it's him. &gt;&gt; I want you to sing this old song with me before we have brother John to come. and he has all the liberty and all the time that he needs. Tuesday night at 7 o'clock, we'll be back here to worship the Lord, to hear the word. Friday evening at 6:00, we invite you to come and pay your respect uh for the memory of Sister Gert Hammond. And uh you know I find myself several times since she passed wishing that I would have known her through the years if I would have had that opportunity to have really known her through the years. But I'm thankful that we got to have the little bit of time with her that we did. And we're going to have a memorial. The family is coming in and and a meal after. And uh I'm just asking that the Lord would be lifted up. And if he's lifted up, he's still drawing. &gt;&gt; I want to sing just a little bit of Born to Serve the Lord. Don't know what key. Sister Laurel or Sister Marbeth, anybody can tell me the key. Do you know? Well, I mean, I don't mean to ignore you. You might know the key, do you? From the dust of the earth, [singing] my God created man, but [music] it took his breath to [singing] make man a living [music] soul. For God so loved this world that he gave his only son and that and that is why I love him so. [singing and music] Let's sing it together. I was made in his likeness, created [singing] in [music] his image. For I I was born to serve the Lord. [music] Oh, I cannot deny him. I will always walk beside him for I I was born to serve the Lord. How many of you believe [music] that's your testimony? Oh yes, my hands, they [music] were made to help my neighbor. And my eyes were made to read God's [music and singing] word. Oh, and my feet they were [singing] made that I could walk in his footsteps. My body [music] is the temple of the Lord. [singing] What a privilege to know that today I was made [music] in his likeness, created in his [music] image. Oh, I I was [music] born to serve the Lord. Oh, and I can't can't deny him. I must always walk beside [music] him [singing] for I I was born [music] to serve the Lord. Let's bring the music down. I want to hear your voices. I was made &gt;&gt; in his [singing] image. [music] For I was born to serve the Lord and I can'ty. [singing] I will always walk beside him. For I I was born to serve the Lord. I know I was and I know you're were you were. Give him another. Worthy. [applause] worthy. Let's stand again and show our honor and respect for the servant of the Lord that has come our way today. Uh I love the oldfashioned ring of his voice. And I like what he brought out last night so much. I feasted on it. Every time I woke up in the night, I was still going over it in my mind. And uh you know, we relate. We relate ourselves more to eagle than anything else. But I found out last night I'm the duck, too. I'm the duck, too. Because I got pretty close to the water one time. I thought I was a land lover, you know, until I got close and then I found out there's waters to swim in. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, there were so many. And I told him as we were eating last night, uh, I love the stories and I love the examples and I love the analogies and that's what happens when you have been ministering as long as our brother has. Stretch your hand this way, would you? Father, in the name of Jesus, this is your gift. This is your son. And we thank you that you're allowing us to drink from this well. And we pray today that he will have strength a and wisdom and the leadership of the Lord to feed this body today. May the anointing of God stand beside him in this moment and come up like a well from the inside. We say spring up a well in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Isn't he good? Isn't God good? &gt;&gt; Come on brother. Hallelujah. Let's welcome him this morning to come. [applause] &gt;&gt; Make sure to keep it close to your mouth. &gt;&gt; God bless you. I tell you what, shalom, little bride. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. I must have done all right last night. You came back this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. I just appreciate you so much. I love you so much from the bottom of my heart. I don't know if brother Shelley has ever felt this way, but you know, I have been places to preach where the Lord moved and you enjoyed the service and you left and you went back home [clears throat] and that was it. But it's different here and it's different a couple other places that I have been. I just feel part of you. I just feel so close to you. I feel like I'm part of you and you you just humble me. You just I I don't really don't know the words to say. I appreciate, brother Ben. The the song selection. Oh my, it was just perfect. It was just perfect. Amen. Because I tell you what, every bit of it just tells us where we are, what we're going through, what we have to look forward to, and and the great God that we serve this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. I appreciate him so much. Amen. Bringing greetings from the from the family and the little church at home. got texts and calls this morning said, "Tell everybody we love them and we miss them and you don't know them and probably most of them don't know you." Amen. But there's that kinship. Amen. That that goes far beyond be goes beyond the recognition of of bloodlines and amen. Goes into that special bloodline. Amen. That comes only from God. And we just appreciate it so much. So we we greet you in their name this morning. We just appreciate the Lord. won't keep you standing. [clears throat] Amen. Long, if you have your Bibles, let's turn to second Corinthians. Amen. And uh my there's been so many great brothers that have stood here along with your your ministry, local church, your minister, Brother Shelley and brother Greley. And and uh my I just I just feel so humbled to to share my little bit. And I guess you found out last night I don't preach like anybody else does. Amen. And uh sometime I uh I think I said it last night, but sometime I I uh battled in myself that way and I said, you know, I wish I could preach like so and so. And if I did, I probably would preach all the time and never stop. But you know, Brother Henry Green told me one time, he said, "Brother Johnny, God's a God of variety." Amen. Nobody's the same. You can't say it like I say it. Aren't you glad for that? And I can't say it like Brother Shelley or Brother Gley or some of these other brothers. is I I just can't get the words to come out that way. Amen. So, just you you don't hold that against me. Okay. Amen. But let's just worship the Lord. 2 Corinthians chapter 10. We'll read a few verses there and maybe turn over to First Peter for one verse there. Amen. Chapter 10, verse one. [clears throat] Amen. Now I Paul was myself beseech you by the meekness and the gentleness of Christ who in presence and base among you. But being absent and bold toward you, I beseech you that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence wherewith I think to be bold against some which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh. For we walk for though we walk in the flesh. That's us. Amen. We do not war after the flesh. For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God the pulling down of the strongholds, casting down imagination and every high thing that exaltth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ. And if you'll turn over to first Peter, [clears throat] amen, chapter 4, let me read you just one verse there. Amen. For as much, verse number one, for as much then as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind. For he hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin. May God add his blessings to his word as you have your seat today. As I said, you know, we've had and you've had many great ministers to to stand here and preach to you and none [clears throat] any more than I have enjoyed than Brother Dwayne Jackson. Amen. When we're here for the for the celebration and and my [clears throat] and uh I kind of pull a little bit from Brother Dwayne. He kind of made me feel like I wasn't so much out of place. But every one of you this morning, Amen. Remember how he walked down this aisle? Amen. uh believe it was on a Thursday night and he whipped out that badge. &gt;&gt; Does anybody happen to remember that? &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and it put something in your mind so that you could remember. And he went on and it wasn't so much about the badge, but it was about what that badge stood for. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, uh nobody's in in trouble. You forgive me if I have to lay that down a moment, but nobody's in trouble this morning except the devil. Amen. Nobody has to worry about anything except the devil. But you know, we read the scripture. Amen. Here. Wherefore, as much then as Christ has suffered, Amen. in the flesh, let us arm ourselves. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Let us arm ourselves. Amen. Now, if you're packing, don't be afraid. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. The only thing we're packing this morning is the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My granddaughter, when I preached this message back home, she calls me Baba and she looked at her daddy. She said, "Baba or daddy?" Why is Baba got a gun on in church? But my my Bible, the King James version says, "Arm yourselves. Amen. &gt;&gt; That word arm according to the dictionary says to provide yourself with the equipment or the knowledge in order to compete or to complete a particular task to enter into a state of readiness for war. &gt;&gt; I've got news for you, church. If you're not aware of it before now, you're in a battle. That's why I I appreciate the song selection this morning. We're in a battle. Amen. And the the battle that we're fighting today, Amen, is with an adversary, with an enemy that is wellqualified. He didn't start this thing yesterday. He's been fighting this battle. He's been doing this all the way from the Garden of Eden. And even before, Amen. He's been fighting. He knows me. He knows you. He knows my weaknesses. He knows your weaknesses. And he doesn't play fair. He will kick you when you're down. He will step on you when you're hurted. He will probe you when you're in trouble. Amen. He will pull down everything that he can. Amen. To defeat you because that's his objective in this life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But Jesus said, "Arm yourselves." Amen. That you might be able to overcome, that you might a be able, Amen. to bring down the strongholds, the imagination. You know, uh uh listen, church, he he is a worthy adversary. &gt;&gt; Amen. But greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world. How many believe that? Amen. Greater is he that's in you than he that is in the world. &gt;&gt; I'll say it again. Greater is he that's in you than he that is in the world. Amen. So, we're going to arm oursel in order to fight this battle. We're fighting an uncontraditional, unconventional enemy. Amen. I said he doesn't fight fair. Amen. But it doesn't matter. You know, when I was growing up, I was always a small and everybody Amen. always picked on me and and and and and took advantage of me because I was always kind of timid and I was always a little smaller. and and one particular bully bullied me all the time until one day he came up and he grabbed me by the by the shirt collar and he started making all these threats and whatever and I waxed bold brother I reached out and I grabbed him by the shirt collar. So there we were and I realized at that moment it was do or die. Amen. And I let Lucy give him one of the best punches I could ever come up with. And for years later when I'd meet him, he said, "I never will forget how you whipped me that day on the playground." Amen. I want the devil to remember. Amen. Every time that we put him on the sole of our feet and we said, "Devil, this is where you belong. He doesn't belong in your life. He has no place in your life. He has no place in your worship. He belongs under your feet today." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; I realize I'm in Alabama, but I got news for you. Ain't nobody ever been shot with an empty holster. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may look dangerous, but you haven't got anything to fight with. &gt;&gt; You may have an appearance. You may have a form of godliness. Amen. But you're never going to kill anybody with an empty holster. Amen. Arm yourself with something. Amen. That will overcome. Kill that enemy before he kills you. Now listen, I'm not I'm not instigating a a a a revolution here only against hell. &gt;&gt; Only against hell. Amen. But that empty holster has never killed anybody. Amen. You have to you might have the appearance of being dangerous. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Second Timothy chapter 3 said, "In the last days, men would depart from the faith, having a form of godliness. &gt;&gt; Looking like they could do something." Amen. Looking like they they believe God. Looking like they're serving God. But you know, there's not much there's not much power in form. &gt;&gt; There's there's there's not not much power in fashion. Amen. But there's power in the word of God. There's power in truth this morning. There's power in faith. As brother Shelley said, there's that faith is is is the main is the main weapon that we can have this morning. You know, the enemy can use all these these these windows to our soul. Imagination, intellectual and what we see and what we hear and what we think and what we use all of those against us. But we've got one that is greater than any of them, and that is faith in the word of God. Do I really believe what God said? Do I really believe that God can do what he said he could do? Amen. But listen, they'll deny the power. They'll they they'll have a form of godliness, but denying the power of Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Isaiah said, "Men draw near with their lips, but their hearts far from me." &gt;&gt; Amen. Their hearts are far from me. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to be a volunteer in this army. Amen. I didn't want to be drafted. I want to be vol. I wanted to volunteer. I remember my dad, you know, during World War II when after the uh Pearl Harbor was bombed, amen, the young men because their their their country had been threatened, their livelihood had been threatened, they begin to volunteer. Any volunteers today? Amen. Some people wait sit back and they wait to be drafted. Some people, amen, might even take off and run to another country because they don't want to serve. I tell you what we need to be. We need to be people that are ready to fight the battle that God has laid out before us. Amen. We need to go into battle, brother Steve. Amen. With a hero mentality. I want to be the one that comes out with all the medals. I want to be the one that comes out that has done something for God. I don't want to be just an average Christian. I want to be a bride Christian. I want to be an overcomer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Him that overcomemeth will I grant to sit on the throne as I have overcome and sit down on the throne with my father. That's what I'm longing for. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you know, we can have all the appearance. We can have all the the the the the holster and whatever. We may we may look dangerous and and and and whatever and none of that's really going to matter. But let me tell you something. You pick up one of these and you start waving it around and you look more a little more dangerous. Amen. People are asking theirelves, "Is that thing loaded?" Don't Don't go to sleep. Don't go to sleep. Amen. But you pick up one of these and you start waving around. Amen. And you look a little more dangerous. Can I get an amen? You look you look like you could do a little more damage if you have one of these around. Amen. So, you've got you've got the mechanics of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. You've got the mechanics. You know, we we've got the word. Amen. The word's been given to us today, but it just this is not enough. &gt;&gt; I know I've got your minds going like you. You're sitting there saying, "Where's Brother Johnny going now?" Amen. But when we pick up one of these, we get we get people's attention. Amen. I I seen some eyes get real big. Amen. I started strapping it. Where what's this going to happen? Where's this going to go? You'll never forget this message. &gt;&gt; You'll never forget this. But brother Greley, I don't want you to remember this message because of this. I want you to remember this message because of the word. Amen. And what I'm trying to get you to say, I'm sure brother Dwayne would tell you the same thing. I don't want you to remember this message because of the badge, but remember this message because of the authority that that badge carries. Remember this message this morning because of the power of the word that you possess this morning to defeat the enemy that would come against you? &gt;&gt; Am I the only one that's ever had a problem? Am I the only one that's going through a battle? Just about every day of my life, the devil comes with something you to raise up and to rise up against me. Whether it be a mental thing, whether it be a physical thing, whatever it is, he comes with every day. You know, when you wake up in the morning, how many times have we heard it said when we wake up in the morning, the devil ought to say, "Oh no, there he is again." Amen. But let me tell you something. When you wake up in the morning, the devil stand said, "Uh-huh. I know you. I've seen you before. I know what your weakness is." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, God knows me. So does the devil. &gt;&gt; So does the devil. Amen. Now I I I [laughter] don't I I I hate to give credit to to him where he is. Amen. But you know that's the way it is sometime. He does know you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not about looks. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not we're not bride because of looks. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not your long dresses, sisters, or your long hair or or the neatness that you brothers. Those things matter. Yes, sir. Amen. But that doesn't make you bride. Amen. That that doesn't make you holiness and whatever. I know Baptist people that dress a lot holier than some of the message people do. Forgive me for saying that, but it's the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you may have the mechanics. You may have the holster. You may have the You may have the firearm. Amen. And that all looks good. And that is the mechanics of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I may wave it around. And I may throw it at you. I may scare you a little bit, but after a while, you're going to have to realize you're going to have to kill that giant. Thank you, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. After a while, you're going to have to realize that it's going to take more than all of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; After a while, you're going to have to reach down deep in your pocket and get one of these. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Now you look dangerous. Now the the situation has changed. Amen. when he comes against you and he wars against you. Amen. In your thoughts and in your mind, he may have something against you. But when you pick up this, the the situation, the scenario has changed because listen, he can't fight against this. Amen. He may fight against me. He may fight against your pastor. Amen. Your sister, but he cannot fight against this. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because this is the word. Listen, it's been tried before. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he took Jesus after 40 days of his weakness. Amen. Physically weak. Can you imagine what that body went through after 40 days of having no nourishment? &gt;&gt; Jesus was basically almost dead &gt;&gt; physically. Google it if you want to. What happens to the body when you go without food and water for that many days? &gt;&gt; Amen. And he took him up to a high mountain and he offered him all this and he offered him that. Amen. But let me tell you something. Jesus overcame. &gt;&gt; You ever asked yourself the question, why did he go through all this? Why did he have to face that? Why did he go through that B? He went through it so he could show you, Amen, that God in the flesh could overcome. Amen. And that's what you are. God in the flesh so you can overcome. Amen. You can be victorious today. Amen. You've got the mechanics. Amen. You've got the dynamics. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I heard some of the brothers talking about hunting last night, so they're very aware of this. Amen. This little cartridge here is composed of three or four different things. Amen. There's the bullet out the front. That's what does the damage. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what does the damage. &gt;&gt; Amen. But inside there is packed with powder. Amen. Inside of there is packed with power. Somebody say, "Amen." And all it takes is for something to hit this little firing pin on the end. And somebody's in trouble. Somebody's in trouble. Amen. That deer, that rabbit, that squirrel, that devil, they are in trouble. Somebody say, "Amen." And when that power, the word of God, when revelation strikes that power, Amen. And it sets that word off. Let me tell you something. The devil is in trouble this morning. Yes. &gt;&gt; I gave you a little scenario last night of the brothers outside debating about whether to come in [snorts] and said, "Did you see what happened to Joe Unbelief? He came out looking like he'd been a practice dummy for the Crimson Tide. He was beat up, blooded, and whatever. I want I want the devil to know that when he sends his imps against the children of God, Amen. things are not going to work out well." &gt;&gt; They sung the song. Listen, when he went to the to when he went to hell, Amen. and he grabbed the keys right off of the devil's belt. Amen. Why Why should we fear? Amen. Somebody doesn't even have the keys to their own house. &gt;&gt; Amen. Doesn't even have didn't even have control over his own household. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But listen, when we have when we listen, the prophet said this that what we're looking for tonight, we're not looking for the mechanics. Amen. We're looking for the dynamics. Amen. So many have got the mechanics of religion and of the Bible. They've got it all bottleized up. It looks like a great big 16 or uh uh 16 or 35 train sitting out on the track. But if it hasn't got any steam in it, then it's not going to go anywhere. Amen. And if it doesn't have any power, if it doesn't have any authority of the word of God, if it doesn't have one of these in it, this is kind of useless. Amen. I could throw it at you. I could wave it around and it could it could give a little bit of fear. But let me tell you something, church. After a while, Brother Daniel, after a while, you're going to have to stop and you're going to have to fight that giant. &gt;&gt; Amen. After a while, you know, I love all the little sayings like, you know, I'm going to give the devil a black eye and booevil. And they all sound good, but you can only boo so long. After a while, you're going to have to pick up a sword of the word of God, and you're going to have to cut that devil's head off. You're going to have to cut that J's head off, take it over, and hang it up in your room. Amen. As a trophy to what God has done. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can boo so long, but after a while, listen, you can bluff the devil a little while, but he's a bigger bluffer than you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I told you, he knows you. He knows me. Amen. He knows exactly what to come come against me with. &gt;&gt; And he's not afraid to use it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; We can come to God, Amen, with just a with with just a a speck of doubt. And we can we can hinder God. Amen. &gt;&gt; But he's a bluffer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you can bluff him so long, but after a while, he's going to realize you're just a bluff, too. &gt;&gt; You remember the story brother Brown told about the butter beans. He planted butter beans and then and and a golfer come along and eat his butter beans. He plant the butter beans and a golfer come along and then eat his butter beans. He said, "So I got smart and I went out and I made a got some some pebbles or marbles. I forget what it was. Put it in a can, hung it up on a stick. So when the gopher came along and he hit that can, it rattled those b those those marbles. Scared the gopher and he go running away. &gt;&gt; He come back and he hit that can and the the stones would rattle around in it. He go running away. Said that happened two or three times. Then after a while, he come and he hit the can and the stones rattled and he ate my butter beans &gt;&gt; cuz he found out it was just a bluff. &gt;&gt; Amen. In myself, I may bluff the devil. But if I've got this, Amen. and I've got the I've got the mechanics and I've got the dynamics. Amen. The devil knows he's in for a fight. If the devil wants to warfare today, church, we're ready. &gt;&gt; We're ready. We're ready to fight. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're ready to fight. Come to God. And if there's any doubt in us, Amen. then that bluff, you can't bluff him. Amen. But if it's real, if that word is really set in your heart, if that word is there by faith, Amen. you can you can overcome him today, church. You can wave it around. You can scare a lot of people, but sooner or later, as I said, you're going to have to put that cartridge in that in that gun, and you're going to have to kill that devil. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can only do it so long after a while. But the writer said, "Arm yourselves." &gt;&gt; Amen. Arm yourselves. Be prepared. &gt;&gt; Let me go back and read that scripture again for you. For as much for as much as Christ has suffered, Amen. in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise. Amen. Arm yourself likewise. &gt;&gt; Now, I said the devil's been doing this all the way since Eden. Amen. He deceived Eve. He tricked He tricked Dave David. Amen. He tempted Jesus. He did all these things. Amen. And we can stand back and we can boo. We can say we give him a black eye and we're going to do all this. We're going to do all that. But after a while, we're going to have to have to pick up this word. Amen. And realize that it's not what I can do, as I said last night, but it's what he can do. It's not about me. It's about him. Somebody say, "Amen." You may not be the quickest draw in the B ride, but let me tell you something. You've got the word behind you. Amen. You don't only have the word of the word, but you got the power of the Holy Spirit, amen, behind you to make you an overcomer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, church, this is not a Barney F gospel. Amen. This is the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the power of God that he's g given to his church. &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. &gt;&gt; Do they not do Do the world not realize what they're missing? Do the do the majority of the church well realize what they're not missing, but not having the fullness of the word of God. You can have the appearance. You can have the quotes. You can have the pictures. You can have every tape, every book. You can have the picture of the prophet. Uh uh uh you can have the picture of the of of Christ. You can have all these things in your house. &gt;&gt; But it's going to take more than a quote. It's going to take more than a tape, more than a book, more than a picture. It's going to take a life that is living for God. It's going to take a life that is qualified. It's going to take a life with the mechanics and the dynamics to be an overcomer. &gt;&gt; And I want to be an overcomer. &gt;&gt; True. And I know that's the desire of every one of you sitting here this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I said that little cartridge doesn't look like much in itself. Can't do much in itself. But I tell you, you put it in you you put it together with the word and the spirit, it can cause some serious damage. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In myself, I can't do anything. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, tie me together with this word. Unite me together with this word. Bring me together with this word. Let my faith, let my ideas and opinions go this way. Amen. But let me get united, amen, with that word. It's not what I can see with my natural eye. It's not what I can hear with my ear. Amen. But it's what thus sayeth the Lord. You know, John said, "Let him that hath an ear. Let him hear what the spirit says to the church." &gt;&gt; But it wasn't with this. I've got a I've got a serious hearing problem. I was telling brother Shelley through all the years of construction stuff I've lost about 80% of my hearing and what I learn didn't know for for a while was that when you lose your hearing amen your brain forgets sounds &gt;&gt; and then when you get that hearing back you have your brain has to learn those sounds all over again. When I first got hearing aids, Amen. Carol and I walked out of the house to go to to church on Sunday morning and the birds were chirping. I said, "What is that? What is that noise?" She said, "That's the birds." My brain had completely forgotten the sound of a bird chirping. Amen. Isn't that Isn't that kind of like the church world today? Amen. Dull of hearing, brother. They have forgotten what the sound of the word of God is. Amen. Because they're dull of hearing. John, let him have an ear to hear. &gt;&gt; Amen. And let me tell you something, these mechanical ears don't work like the real thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. And your mechanical doctrine. Amen. And your man-made doctrine and your man-made ideas don't work like as good as this does. &gt;&gt; It's just not the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You forgive me for all this. Amen. But you know, I don't know if anybody in here has hearing aids. I hope you don't have to have but they can't recognize Amen. the difference between music and noise. &gt;&gt; So when brother Ben starts singing, Amen. It's it's like a noise to me. Thank God mine have a program in them that I can change them around. Amen. And get them where I can recognize the music and and whatever. But you can't change, Amen. the word around. It's absolute to begin with. &gt;&gt; Amen. My Bible said that we are armed. Amen. And you don't have to be a pastor. You don't have to be a deacon. You don't have to be this. Amen. Just be a just be a servant. &gt;&gt; Amen. But remember this. God didn't call us servants. He called us sons. &gt;&gt; Amen. He called He called us sons and daughters. Amen. He didn't just call us servants. Amen. He called us sons. We're we're far beyond that that servant stage. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know when God spoke to to Abraham over in the 14th chapter, Amen. or Abram as he was when he heard that his brother had been taken captive, the scripture said that he armed, &gt;&gt; Amen. the servants of his household. And if a servant can fight this battle, how much more, amen, can a can a man that's got the star on his chest, amen, that has been sworn in, amen, by the word of God, that has been put in a position as a son or daughter of God, become a marshall in this word of God, he has a right, amen, to defend this word and to oh my, and to get the benefit of everything God has. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not just a servant. You're a son. You're a daughter. You're not just a deputy. &gt;&gt; You're not Barney F. Amen. You are [screaming] the marshall. You are the one in charge today. The power belongs to you. &gt;&gt; The power belongs to me. The power that comes from this word, the mechanics and the dynamics come together to make us what we are. For as much as Christ has suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves, Amen. with the same mind. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Oh Lord, does anybody have a problem with their mind? &gt;&gt; You know, every battle that is fought, Amen. When that battle is is is is getting ready to be fought, there's a there's a battleground chosen. During World War II, there was the Italian campaign where my dad fought. There was the African campaign. There was a the the South Pacific campaign. There was this campaign. Amen. And every when when the children of Israel, amen, were kept about what down there in the valley of Eli, amen, that that that that location was determined, of course, the Philistines thought that getting them in the valley, as I said last night, was going to give them advantage. And sometime the devil get you down. And he thinks he's got an advantage. I seen a little thing one time said, the devil thought he had me defeated when he said when I had my head down and then he heard me say, "Amen." Amen. He found out that I wasn't defeated. I was just thanking God. &gt;&gt; Amen. But listen, sometime the devil will come at you. Amen. When you're when you're feeling bad and when you're when you're suffering a disease or something, even maybe a life-threatening disease, and he'll use that against you. Amen. He'll just keep pushing you down. Well, if God be God, and if he said he'd heal you, why aren't you healed? I am healed. &gt;&gt; I am. &gt;&gt; I am healed. Amen. Say, "Well, you're still limp. You still got a problem. You still got this. You're still taking prescription. I am healed." Why? because that word said so. The authority of it said so. Amen. But this mind, you know, every battle was had a had a a a battleground set out a a place. And what did the prophet say? What did the word say? That here it is. Amen. When God created Adam, he created him a spiritual man. But then he created him a body. And he put him in that body. And when he put him in that body, trouble came about. Amen. Is this body of flesh. It's my will. It's my ability to say yes and no, to choose or not choose that gets me in trouble. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it all starts up here. &gt;&gt; And you don't have to be a genius, amen, to know it. It all starts up here. And and the longest journey, Amen, is not from here to Durham, North Carolina. The longest journey is from here to here. Amen. And boy, let me tell you, the devil will war everything he can to get it out of your uh keep it in your mind because that's where he can work at it. If it ever gets in your heart, he can't mess with it. Amen. But as long as in your mind, you can change your mind. &gt;&gt; You can change your mind. &gt;&gt; But if it ever gets in your heart, it becomes real. &gt;&gt; There's nothing you can do about it. Amen. It's like I like I said last night talking about my my ancestry. Amen. I I I was always a Thornton. Amen. Nothing they could do about it. And and will you forgive me for just going back to something I missed last night. Amen. And and because I wanted to share it with you so much because listen, we're not only bloodline, but we're part of God. But the the great artist Reimbrandt [clears throat] signed his portraits, his pictures, and he said the reason that he signed them was because he wanted people to know that he was the one that painted that picture. And even the atheist uh Stephen Hawkins said one time said, "Is it possible that the intellect or the intelligence being left his signature on his creation?" So let me give you a little scientific fact. the DNA module and the man that created this or discovered this just passed away just a couple of months ago. But the DNA modular that that that connects Ever Thornton that was Amen. that they could go back and they d could dig up my great greatgrandfather. Amen. And they could get DNA and they could prove that he was my great greatgrandfather because of the DNA. Amen. You know, you can go all the way back to God and dig it up and prove that you're his sons and daughters. Amen. Because he saw you except in the word of God. &gt;&gt; But the DNA module appears as a double helix. It's like a spiral staircase. Amen. And in that spiral staircase, there's there's bridges that are called sufferic bridges. Amen. And what they do, they hold that DNA stream all together. And they recur they recur in a set pattern. Amen. That every 10 acids there's a bridge. And then every five assets there's another bridge. And then every six assets there's another bridge. And then every five assets there another there's another bridge. And you say where's all this going with the significance of those numbers 10 5 6 and five. Those numbers correspond with the Hebrew numbers. Amen. The numbers that correspond with the Hebrew letters rather wh the very name of God. And and when Moses said, "Who shall I say sent me?" God said, "Tell them I am have sent you." So see every God has his DNA. Amen. All the way down into you. All the way from the foundation world. Just as the artist Rembrandt put his signature on that painting, God has put his signature on your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he's put that signature right in your life where you can you can look back and just say, "I am who I am by by the grace of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. But arm yourselves with the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Arm yourself with the mind of Christ. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers of the air. And this won't do any good &gt;&gt; against principalities and powers of the air. &gt;&gt; Amen. My intellect, my knowledge, my understanding will not do any good against the principalities and the powers of the air. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're armed for a battle today, church. And before that battle takes place, Amen. that that ground is set. And when when the enemy set that ground and listen, it went all the way back to the to the beginning when Satan and Michael wared in heaven and he got cast out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, we're kind of like wheat. We're body, soul, and spirit. Amen. We're governed by the senses. As I said, you know, we we base a lot of what we do on what we can see and what we can hear, what we can taste, what we can smell. Amen. And those things a lot of time, you know, I can look I can look at my situation. And the devil can make me doubt the promise of God. &gt;&gt; But if I look at my situation, Amen. in the light of the word of God, he can't do anything about it. He can if I look at it according to my my pain or my disease or my prescription. Amen. He can use that against me in my mind. But if I look at it according to the word that says I'll supply all your needs according to my riches and glory that by my stripes you're healed. If I look at it according to the word of God and not the prescription bundle. Let me tell you something. Something and life is entirely different. &gt;&gt; I live a different life. &gt;&gt; Amen. because of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, you we're we're we're free moral agents. We have the ability to choose. We have the ability to make a choice. Amen. As I said earlier, you know, we should every one of us should have this mentality. I'm going into war as a hero. I'm going to come out a hero. I'm going to come out victorious. &gt;&gt; No man ever enters a race with this determination in his heart. I'm going to race, but I'm going to lose. I'm not even worried about winning. I'm just going to enter a race and I'm going to lose. &gt;&gt; What kind of mentality is that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the devil would tell you, you can't win. &gt;&gt; Has he ever told anybody here you can't win? Has he ever told you when you were sick, you ain't going to get any better. &gt;&gt; You can't You're not going to This thing is going to kill you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, whatever it does, Paul said to be with Christ is one thing. To be with him is the same thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I can't lose. If I stay here, I I I win. Amen. If I go with him, I win. &gt;&gt; It's the same thing, church. But we we get we have that decision making process. Amen. And the decisions are made up here. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what gets us in trouble a lot of times. It's not question of mind over matter. &gt;&gt; It's a question of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Certain Satan's approach is from the inside. Amen. If he can get in your mind. Amen. But what did the scripture say? Be not conformed to this world. Amen. But be you transformed. &gt;&gt; Don't you love that word transformed? That just sounds like power to me. Amen. Be you transformed by the renewing of your mind. Not double-minded. &gt;&gt; Not this way one day and the next way the next day you're some other way. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; You know, when Jesus came, they said that they they sought to to stone him. And he said, "For what good works do you stone me?" And this is not for any of your good works that we're we we're doing this. It's because you a man are making yourself God. Boy, did they have that backwards. Amen. He wasn't God making him a man making himself God. He was God that made himself a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when the devil looks at you, he says, "See this." He said, "See God manifested in you." &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Oh, I want to see God." Turn around. Look at those sitting beside of you. Amen. and you see God manifested in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Boy, how hard that is for the world to accept. &gt;&gt; Amen. That you could actually stand here and say, "I'm I'm like God." &gt;&gt; Amen. I am part of him. Amen. That DNA, that ancestry followed right on down through every generation of whatever. And and and here I am being manifested of God. &gt;&gt; He thought it not equal to be God. &gt;&gt; So, we're armed with the mind of Christ. when he went when he was tempted and the devil said if you do this if you'll do that the only thing that Jesus ever done was said it is written &gt;&gt; amen it's written that you'll not serve man shall serve God and him alone it's it's written this it's written that amen what was his defense today church it was the word my defense today it's the word it's not this &gt;&gt; doesn't scare the devil &gt;&gt; but that'll make him step back and take another Look. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you start waving this. &gt;&gt; Amen. You start waving this. Brother was talking about the Goliath and David and his five stones. It only took one. Amen. It only took one. Everybody's concerned about what happened to the other four stones. I just worried about the one. Amen. All it takes is one person believe in God. Amen. If God can get you to believe, he can do great things. If God can get you to have faith in his word and know that whatsoever God has said, it shall not fail because he's not a man that he should fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if he can get you under his control, if he can get us on me under his control, then God could do great things in this hour. Somebody say, "Amen. We are responsible for this hour, church. We are the God that anybody's going to see." Amen. This uh facts say that that most people will never pick up their Bible and read it, but they'll read you every day. They'll see the life that you live. And you don't have to go around preaching to them. &gt;&gt; You don't have to go around saying uh uh uh uh asking a blessing over your food in a restaurant loud enough for everybody to hear that. God's not a showman. &gt;&gt; But if that life is in there, amen, it'll go forth. &gt;&gt; I remember one time I was going through a real sur severe trial battle in my mind. is when I had the limousine service and I had to go to the airport many mornings very early 3 and 4:00 in the morning and I was all discouraged and and despondent, depressed. Amen. And and just felt like I I just didn't know what to do. And I walked into the convenience store to get a cup of coffee while I waited on the flight. And a gentleman was there from the some middle eastern country and I paid the bill and he looked at me. He said, "You're a preacher, aren't you, Brother Shel? I like to cry like a baby." I said, "God, you do know who I am, don't you?" &gt;&gt; Amen. I never That man had never spoke to me before. I never spoke to him, but there was something that emanated that made him know there was something different about me. That's no glory to me. That's no glory to me. Amen. But it's glory to God because that word, that life, that that life of God, amen, will come. the mechanics. Amen. The dynamics it will it will come out and people will be able to recognize. Amen. And they'll say, "I don't know what it is, but there's something different about you. I don't know what what you've done. I don't know how you live. I don't know this. I don't know." But there's something different about you. &gt;&gt; Yes, there's something different about us. Amen. We serve a living God. &gt;&gt; Arm yourselves with the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Arm yourself. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. You know, this this gun carries about six cartridges. I think we won't get about two or three of them on the devil today. Amen. But there's a whole lot more where these came from. Amen. There there's a whole there's a whole lot more where they came from. There's a whole lot more where this came from. Amen. So, let me tell you something. You may be armed with the mind of Christ, but he also armed us with a pardon. &gt;&gt; Oh my. What a precious thing it is. Amen. To be to to have that. And the word pardon means the action of forgiving or being forgiven or of an error or an offense. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; 2 Coronicles 30 and 18. Listen. For a multitude of people, even many of Ephraim, Manasses, Ishikar, and Zebulun have not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the Passover. Otherwise, then it was written, but Hezekiah prayed for them. Amen. And the good Lord pardoned them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I got news for you. I'm not on parole today. &gt;&gt; I'm not on parole today. &gt;&gt; I'm not worried that if I don't do something just right, Amen, that the guy's going to come and grab me up and put me back in jail. God's not standing around waiting for me to make a mistake so he can kick me off into hell. Amen. He's standing there, amen, ready to forgive. Amen. To a repentant soul, to a repentant person. He's ready, amen, to welcome us back in. Why? Because that pardon is forever. &gt;&gt; And he pardoned me before. Listen, church, you can have a pardon even before you commit the crime. That's it. &gt;&gt; Amen. I was pardoned way back there before I ever got here and became a sinner in this flesh. I was already pardoned. Oh my. You ought to shout, "Praise the Lord for that. I'm already free." &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm already free. They sang the song, "It's already done. It's already done. I'm already healed. I'm already saved. I'm already pardoned. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isaiah chapter 40, he said, "Speak ye comfortably to to Jerusalem and say unto her, for her warfare is accomplished." Her warfare is accomplished. Church, it's going to be over soon. Amen. We're fighting every day. &gt;&gt; It's true, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, there may be some here that says, "Well, you know, things are pretty good to me. I'm not going through a battle. I'm not going through a trial. I'm not going through this and the other. God bless you. Come and tell me how to do that. Amen. Because I have a battle every day &gt;&gt; in some way, some form, some some some way. Amen. If it's nothing but a a thought that the devil puts in my mind, &gt;&gt; Amen. If it's if it's nothing but speaking harshly, Amen. because I'm frustrated over this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then I need that pardon. speaking comfort to Jerusalem and cry unto her. Amen. That her warfare is accomplished and that her iniquity is pardoned. Amen. Let me say it again. I ain't on parole. Amen. I don't have to check in ever so often. Amen. Because he done the work. He done it completely. He done it once and for all. Amen. And I don't have to worry about it. All I've got to do is is be mindful of what God has done for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everybody's heard the story, I'm sure, about President [snorts] Lincoln and the and the young man that that was wrongly uh uh uh convicted and uh they were going to hang him and and his friends went to the president and and and sought a pardon for him. And President Lincoln after hearing all the the the news and and the the facts and everything, he took a piece of paper and he scribbled down on it. The man's name said, "I pardon so and so." Amen. President Abraham Lincoln. And when they took it to the man in in the cell and told him, "Look, we've got a pardon for you." Amen. He looked at it. Amen. He said, "This this is a trick that it's not real." He said, "If this was a if this was a a real pardon, it'd be on presidential stationary." Amen. It'd have the seal on it. It'd have the pres have all this stuff on it. Amen. And he refused that pardon and he was hung. and delay years later that he the the government was sued because of it. Amen. And the verdict came back that a pardon is only a pardon when you receive it as a pardon. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, it's up to you. It's in your ability. It's in your hand to accept what God has done for us today, church. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Jesus took his he took his blood. Amen. And he took and he wrote on my sins and everything, your pardon. and cast him into the sea of forgiveness &gt;&gt; never to be remembered anymore as far as the east is from the west. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; You realize you can start at the north pole and you can start south and at at some point you will no longer be going you will no longer be going south. You will be going north. But did you know that if you start in the east, Amen. and you start east. There is no point ever that you will not be going east. &gt;&gt; You will always be going east. There's no there's no time that it ever change. Amen. That's why I love the fact that he cast our sins into the sea of forgiveness as far as the east is from the west because there is no ending to the east. It continues forever. You're always going east. &gt;&gt; Amen. So make sure you're always going east and not north and south. You're armed with a pardon. &gt;&gt; And by his own blood, he rode across those sins. He rode across our life. Amen. And he cast it into the sea of forgiveness. Amenise. &gt;&gt; You know, when you're on parole, you're just you're just a prisoner temporarily released. Amen. You're still a prisoner. You got to check in. You got to do this. Amen. &gt;&gt; But when you're pardoned, you can go. I stood in in in Ford Theater in Washington years ago down in the bottom of the of the theater there, they have a museum. And in that museum, they have President Lincoln's coat hanging on a on a on a um whatever they call those things, mannequin, I guess it is. Hanging on that mannequin. And on that coat, Brother Shel, you can see the the blood stain. And I thought, Lord have mercy. That man gave his life to free a people. &gt;&gt; I said, "But there's a greater one today." Amen. To look back at Calvary and see the blood that was shed there. Amen. Not not the DNA. Amen. Not the blood type ABC, BC, whatever. Amen. That that dripped onto the ground, but the life that was in that blood because the scripture said that the life of the flesh is the blood, but the life of the blood is the spirit. But it was that spirit, amen, that that redeemed you and I today that pardoned us. Amen. It wasn't the literal blood, brother Greley, amen, that signed my pardon. What it was was the Holy Spirit that said, I go to the father and if I go to him, the Holy Spirit will come and he'll fill you. And guess what, church? On the day of Pentecost, Amen. There was a sound of a rushing mighty wind that filled all the house. Kind of like it was this morning. Amen. And he filled every one of the believers with the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank God for that today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Nehemiah in in describing Israel's deliverance. Amen. And refused to obey, neither were they mindful of the wonders that thou thou didest among them, but they hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage. But thou art a God ready to pardon. Amen. Thou art a God ready to pardon. Gracious, listen, listen to me. Gracious and merciful, slow to anger and of great kindness. Amen. Forsook them not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You ever felt like God left you? You ever felt like you were all alone? Amen. I said last night, Lord, don't you remember sometime you see what's going on down here? Amen. He's never forgotten you. &gt;&gt; Amen. when you're at your lowest point. Amen. He has not forgotten you. No matter what you're going through, he has never forgotten you. Amen. Never, never, never, never, never. We could say it many times, but he has never forgotten you. &gt;&gt; What did he say? I'll never leave you. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I'll go with you even to the end of the earth, even to the end of the age. Amen. When God was speaking to Moses, he said, "Behold, I'll send my angel before thee to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee to the place which I have prepared. Beware of him and obey his voice. Provoke him not, for he will not pardon your transgression. My name is in him. But if thou will indeed obey his voice." &gt;&gt; Here we back to him. Here we are back to it's in my control. It's up to me whether or not to accept God's pardon. It's up to me to to to have my mind changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can I tell you this? When Moses stood on the mountain and the bush was burning, Amen. The bush is still burning. &gt;&gt; The bush is still on fire today. Amen. It was not unusual for Moses to see a bush that was burning on the on the on the side of the mountain. It was probably a common thing. Why? Because lightning would strike the bushes and they would burn. But there was something different. Amen. There's people shouting just like you did this morning. There's people singing just like you did this morning. There's people even claiming to believe what you believe this morning. But there's something different. Amen. And the difference was that that bush that burned that day were not consumed. Amen. They shout and it runs out. They sing and it runs out. They go to church and it runs out. You come to church. Amen. It is continual. You take it home with you. You sing, you take it home with you. You shout, you take it home with you. You love God, you take it to your job. You love God, [music] you take it to the school. Amen. It does not run out. &gt;&gt; There is an ex inexhaustible supply. &gt;&gt; There's an [screaming] inexhaustible supply of the mercy and the grace and the blessings of God today. I'll never leave you, never forsake you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's only good. It's only as good as you will let it be. that pardon is only as good as you will let it be. Isaiah chapter 55 said, "Let the wicked forsake, Amen, his ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God. He will abundantly, he will abundantly, I love that word, abundantly." That's more than I can hold. Amen. That's more than I can That's more than I can comprehend. He will more than abundantly pardon. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you armed this morning, church? Amen. Are you equipped for the battle? Amen. Do you have what it takes? Amen. It's not your ability. Amen. It's not your understanding, but it's the it's the word of God. Amen. He will abundantly pardon this. Listen, Jeremiah said, "I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned against me." Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll cleanse every one of them. Amen. And I will pardon all their iniquities wherever by they have sinned and whereby they have transgress against me. &gt;&gt; Whosoever will, let him come. &gt;&gt; On the front of that door over there, it could be whosoever will. And when you go through that door and shut it behind you and you look on the back side of that door, Brother Daniel, it says predestinated before the foundation of the world. Amen. because that's whosoever will. Amen. Those are the ones that would come. You're the ones that will come. Those that were predestinated. Amen. Those that were pardoned before the foundation of the world. Those that are armed with the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I mentioned the scripture last night how that God laid on Jesus Christ the sins of the world. Amen. So that he that knew no sin could become sin. Amen. So that you that knew that did not know God could become God. So that when God looked at Jesus, he saw me. And when he looked at me, he saw Jesus. Amen. Why? Because we have become one. I don't know about you, but sometime I look in the mirror in the morning, I don't like what I see. Amen. And I sometime brother G, I say, God, how do you see me? Amen. Don't let me see myself, but let me see how you see me. Let me be what you want me to be. Let me reflect not my image. Not let me not reflect what I am. But let me reflect the word of God. Let that word shine forth out of me. Let me be armed with the spirit of God, with the mind of God, with the pardon of God, with the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me have it all. But he said that he laid on him the sins of the world so that he could become when he looked at him, he saw me. And when he looked at me, Amen. he saw himself. &gt;&gt; Hello, [snorts] devil. You want a challenge? Here sets a bunch of people that's ready for the challenge. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's got 6,000 years of experience. Brother Brandham said, Amen. He's the God of this world. He's done a pretty good job of it. He's pretty He's pretty much succeeded in it. Amen. It's not enough to shout. It's not enough of this good singing as great as it is and how much I appreciate it. Brother Shel asked me again this morning, you going to stay back here? How can I stay back there with all this going on out here? How can you stay back there with all that going on out here? Amen. I want to be part of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to I want to enjoy it. I want to rejoice in it with you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Greater is he. The flesh, the senses. Amen. He may be bigger than me. Sure he is. May be bigger than you. May be bigger than your pastor. He ain't bigger than my God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's just it. He's not He's not bigger than the one that that lives on the inside of me. Listen. John 16:33. I have told you these things so that in me you might have peace. In the world you would have trouble, but take heart. Take heart. I have overcome the world. Amen. I have overcome the world. And if he's overcome, he said that I could overcome. Let me let me give you the amplified version of that scripture. It says, "I have deprived it of its power. &gt;&gt; I have taken all of its power away to harm you and have conquered it for you. &gt;&gt; I don't have to worry. He's already won the battle." &gt;&gt; Amen. All I got to do is just pick up the flag and run along behind saying, "Glory to God. We are victorious." "The battle's not mine," said little David. "It belongs to God." "The battle's not mine," says her new hope. Amen. and it belongs to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. All I've got to do is rejoice in the victory. Amen. That's what you were doing this morning. You're rejoicing in the victory that God has given you today. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You can't overcome in yourself. I can't overcome in myself. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It just lives in us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's part of me. &gt;&gt; Amen. We struggle sometime to live for God. &gt;&gt; Why are you struggling? Quit struggling. Quit trying to live for God. Yes. &gt;&gt; Quit trying to live for God. Rest in him. Amen. Be filled with the Holy Ghost. And that Holy Spirit lives in you. See, &gt;&gt; you don't know what it's like to be a Thornton, &gt;&gt; but I do. &gt;&gt; Amen. The world doesn't know what it's like to be a believer, but you do. Why? Because it lives on the inside of you. Because that word that God is living through you. Amen. And as natural it is for you to raise your hand, Amen. or to eat a meal. It's just as natural for you to serve God &gt;&gt; and to please God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You realize how hard that is. &gt;&gt; You realize how hard it is to raise your hand. &gt;&gt; Try holding it up there for 10 minutes. &gt;&gt; See, it wasn't born to be that way. You weren't born to be that way. You were born for your arms to be down like this. That's the reason you're made that way. But when you do this, you defy gravity. You defy the laws of nature. Amen. and you defy everything and you give glory to God. Amen. And when you stand on this word, you defy everything that this natural body was born into this life for. You defy everything that the devil has against you. Amen. You give glory unto God. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not natural for me to do this. &gt;&gt; It's not natural for me to serve God. Everything in me, Amen, is against God. Everything about this natural man is contrary to serving God. But when he comes on the inside, gravitation loses its hold and the hand and and spontaneously before you even recognize it or even realize, brother Greek, your hand went up to praise the Lord. Your voice echoes, glory to God. Amen. You start raising your hand. You start praising the Lord. You start patting your foot, clapping your hand, giving glory to God. All of that is contrary to what you are &gt;&gt; in the natural. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But not in the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Was it within the ability of the Hebrew children to quench the fire? &gt;&gt; It wasn't within the ability of of of Daniel to close the mouth of the lion. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't find anything in the scripture where he was ever trained as a lion trainer. He didn't have a whip in a chair, but he had God. Amen. You may not have what the world looks at and said, "Well, you know, there this, there, that, and that, there." It doesn't matter what the world sees. It's what God has given you. Amen. And God had given the Hebrew children. Amen. Something that that the king didn't have any idea what it was all about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when they stepped to that fiery furnace, they looked in there, brother Greley, and they didn't see anything but fire. &gt;&gt; Sometime God will bring you, Amen, brother Benjamin, right to the brink. He will bring you to the edge of the water. He will bring you to the edge of of of persecution. He will bring you to the edge to the edge of total destruction, so to speak. Amen. But he will never leave you nor forsake you. When your feet touch the water, the water's going to roll back. And God's going to make a way. When your feet have faith, amen. If you touch that word, the water's going to roll back. The healing's going to come. Amen. The joy is going to be there no matter what if you just hold on to God. &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. &gt;&gt; You realize it rained for 40 days and 40 nights, &gt;&gt; but it stopped raining on day 41. You realize that Goliath, Amen, tortured and and and battered the children of Israel for 40 days. But on day 41, David took his head off. &gt;&gt; Do you realize that Moses lived and hid in the desert for 40 years? But year 41, he went down and delivered Israel. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Amen." What are you saying, Brother Johnny? Your your giant will fall. Amen. Your victory come. Amen. It took 40 years in the wilderness for Israel. Amen. But on year 41 to enter the promised land, your giant will fall. Amen. Your victory will come. Amen. Your promised land will come into sight. Amen. If you don't give up on day 40. &gt;&gt; If you persevere, if you hold on, if you don't give up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Day 41, year 41 is coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. Your deliverance is coming. Amen. Why? Because you're armed with the with the weaponry. You're armed with that that would that will be able to overcome the principalities and the powers of the air and the spirit that would war against you even in this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Greater things. Amen. The greatest thing is to overcome myself. I said sometime I look in the mirror and I don't like what I see. Amen. But the greatest thing if we can overcome this flesh, if we can overcome ourselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know when the woman met Jesus at the well, you know what? She just she had all these hidden secrets. She had all these things in her life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And she came to the well at a different time because of her life. &gt;&gt; Amen. She didn't want to be associated or couldn't be associated with with those that that were uh would come to the well at certain times. But the difference between this trip and the trips before is that she met somebody different. &gt;&gt; And I love the scripture where Jesus told the disciples, he said, "I must need to go through Samaria." &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't it amazing that Jesus had a need? &gt;&gt; His need was to meet her need. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, this this is not to make anybody feel bad, but you know, we're we're people of habit. &gt;&gt; Amen. We come to church, we come in, we sit on the same pew in the same spot every service. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're we're we're people of of uh we're just kind of put into a mold. God God forbid that somebody come in with a with a Barnameus spirit. Amen. And sit down beside of us. Amen. Because you know what's going to happen with a Barnameus spirit? He's going to start screaming out, "Lord, have mercy on me." Why? Because he has a need. The problem is that some of us realize or or feel like we don't have a need anymore. But I tell you this morning, the greatest day of your life was not when you got married, not when you got your first home, not when you had your first child. The greatest day of your life was when you recognized you had a need &gt;&gt; and that need was for God. &gt;&gt; That was the greatest day of your life. Amen. You can put up all your accolades and this and that and the other. They don't mean a thing. &gt;&gt; The greatest day of your life was when you Amen. recognize I need Jesus. &gt;&gt; I need him. I can't make it without him. I can't go any further. You ever been to Did you get to that place? Sure you did. That's why you believe him today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The greatest day of your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we can overcome ourselves and it's hard to do because we make mistakes and we we have faults and we have failures. Amen. That's just part of who we are. I think I said it last night. That does not define who we are. Amen. We're we're we're children of God, sons of God. Amen. And you know, you have a mistake and people say, "You backslid." Well, prophet of God said, "You just broke that fellowship with God for a while." Amen. Because, as I told you last night, I have a son. His name is Adam. Ain't nothing he he's my son regardless. He may not always please me. Of course, he he does now. He does pretty good. Amen. And he's single, ladies. Amen. [laughter] I'm losing my armor. Amen. But listen church, &gt;&gt; the point is he's my son. I may not have agreed with everything he done in the past, but he was always my son. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may displease God sometime, but you're still his son. &gt;&gt; And that's where the pardon comes in. Though he's seen our iniquities, though he's seen our faults, though he's seen our failures, Amen. He still gave us a pardon. Amen. &gt;&gt; When Jesus was tempted, Amen. I said a little while ago, the reason I believe he was tempted is so that he could show you and I that that the flesh could overcome as long as it depended on the word. &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't say, "Well, you know, that that stone could make a nice French bread or something." He said, "It's written, man shall not live by bread alone." &gt;&gt; Amen. See, the devil will he'll play with the scripture and and he knows the scripture. He said, "You cast yourself down cuz it's already written." Amen. Don't ever think that he won't bring and use the very thing that you love against you. Amen. He will twist it around. Amen. One word here or there. We've seen that. Amen. This time of the year, we've seen that a whole lot. Twisting the word around. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It only took one word for Eve to to to sell out to the to the serpent creature. &gt;&gt; Amen. No, not one of us sitting here this morning, Amen. have the desire to quit serving God. There's not one of us that woke up this morning and said, "I think I'll just quit. I think I'll just go on back out in the world." It wasn't part of you. It's not part of you. It's not who you are because you've been redeemed. You've been born again. Amen. Nobody wants to fail God. Nobody wants to displease God. How many say amen? &gt;&gt; Sometime we do. Sometime we fail, but it doesn't define who we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 4, when Jesus attempted, we mentioned it. Amen. He overcome not by the not by himself, not by his desires, but by the word of God. The psalmist David said in 142, he said, "I pour out my complaint before him. I've showed him my trouble." &gt;&gt; Amen. I know where to go. Don't you church? Amen. I show him my trouble when my spirit was overwhelmed within me. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that? Can you imagine David? He was the shoutiness, dancest, harp playing music, music musician that you could ever find. Amen. Here he is saying, "I am overwhelmed." Amen. I am totally defeated. Amen. But guess what? God doesn't defeat you. Amen. I love the story of Joseph and I know you've all read it. Amen. Jacob, rather. Amen. when he when he wrestled with the angel and the and the the angel told him said, "Let me go and I'm not going to let you go." Whatever. And and there there Jacob is laying with his hip out of joint. I can identify with him. Amen. And and he carried that limp for whatever. And God looked down at him and said after he had broken, he said, "I can't leave him there." Amen. Sometime God has to break us. &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with being broken. Amen. Because the breaking, Amen. Being broken is a sign of healing. Amen. You remember the story about the little the little sheep. Amen. That wouldn't stay in line with he's off running here and there. After a while, the shepherd had to pick him up and he broke his leg. You say, "Well, how terrible that is." That brother Shelly would preach such a message that would hurt people's feelings. Sometime he has to break you to make you, Amen, what you need to be. And that shepherd would take that sheep with a little broken leg and he'd put him up around his shoulders and he'd carry him until that leg healed. And then when that leg was healed, he'd put him down and he was worse than your house cat. You can't get rid of him. He's walking all under your feet. Every step he take, he's between your legs. You can't. That's the way I want to be. I want to be so in love with him. He can't get rid of me. Everywhere he goes, every step he takes, I'm right there with him. Amen. And Lord, if it takes breaking me a time or two, break me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because listen, nothing wrong with being broken because I said it's is it's a sign of healing. David said, "I poured out my complaint before him. I've shued before him my trouble." When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, thou knowest my path. &gt;&gt; Amen. That word overwhelm means to bury beneath or to defeat completely. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I said, "Can you imagine David, &gt;&gt; a man after God's own heart? Can you imagine, brother Shel having a battle?" Well, he's the pastor. I guarantee he has more battles than you do. &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz he's got all of your burdens laying on top of him. He's got all your lives and all your responsibilities. Amen. laying on his shoulder. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's When you When you're going through a trial, when you're going through sickness, who's suffering? Not just you. He is. Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. When you're when you're straying a little bit from the word and he sees your life getting a little bit tarnished, who is it that's that's on his knees talking to God about it? Lord, restore them. Lord, do this. It's your pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't ever don't ever underestimate that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He was overwhelmed, totally defeated. Amen. Do you know who you are, church? Do you know who you are? We talked about the angel coming to Mary last night. Amen. God sent a messenger to you and I. Amen. To prepare us for a rapture. I hope you believe in a rapture. And I know that you do. Amen. There's going to become a catching away. Amen. In a moment, the twinkling of an eye. Amen. Let's do a little exper experiment. Everybody close your eyes and count to three. All right. Open your eyes. You opened your eyes, you're in New Hope Revival Ministry Church. Is that right? You realize in the same three seconds that you had your eyes closed, you could have been in the eternity of God. &gt;&gt; You could have been in the eternity of God. That's how quick your life can change. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's how important it is always to be in tune with God. That's how important it all it is. Amen. To know that God is in control of your life. that you're armed with the right thing. Amen. To be able to overcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. That you not only have the the appearance, &gt;&gt; Amen. But you have the mechanics, but you also have the dynamics. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because they all three go together to make you a total overcomer. Amen. There's a life to be lived. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a life to be manifested. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's according to the word of God. That's that's your appearance. Amen. And then there's the mechanics. You've got the word, but you've got to have also a revelation of that word. How many people read this Bible every day? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many people open this Bible this Sunday morning in their church and read, but they never got out of Malachi 4? They never got out of re Revelation. They never got out of Matthew 28:19 what you got. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a difference. Something made a difference. I said a little bit ago about Moses in the burning bush that the bush was still burning. You know the the word that came to Moses when when the angel spoke to him out of the bush. He said, "I have heard the cries of my people and I am come down to deliver them." Let me tell you something. Deliverance is not a thing of the past. &gt;&gt; Deliverance is just as real today. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not something that ended with our revivals, brother Shel, in the 60s and whatever. That deliverance is still just as prevalent today as it ever has been. And if you want deliverance, I got news for you. I can tell you where to go. &gt;&gt; Of course, you already know that. &gt;&gt; I don't have to tell you. That's been preached to you for years here. You know where to go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not just knowing who we are. &gt;&gt; It's knowing where we are. &gt;&gt; Where we are with God. I mentioned it last night. Our precious brother, brother Perry Green said many times or one time particularly in church, he said, "The fact that we're here, not in not in the church building here, but the fact that we're here in our walk with God is evidence that God is going to carry us the rest of the way. He did not bring me here to lose me. He didn't bring you here to turn you loose. He didn't bring you this far, amen, not to take you the rest of the way. You are here because God ordained that you be here. and he ordained that you be here so you could be there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How do we respond to it? How we don't going to react to it? Amen. When we wake up, does the devil come sniffing around seeking? Amen. How he can play the doubter and amen. Make us disbelieve the word of God. Amen. Well, one good whiff of the Holy Ghost, like that little duck getting one one whiff of that water, one good smell of the Holy Ghost, and he's gone. Amen. Those that the son have made free are free indeed. Amen. Those that the son have made free are free indeed. What's that word deed mean? You're free in every aspect of your life. Amen. You're free of everything the devil can bring against you. You're free of it. Can the church say, "I'm free." Amen. I'm free this morning. Amen. No matter what the devil says, I'm free. &gt;&gt; Amen. Free. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Cartridge number three. The greatest weapon that the bride of Christ ever possessed was the power of prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. The communication between you and the almighty God. &gt;&gt; Amen. The ability to talk to the creator, amen, of the heavens and the earth. The most powerful weapon in our arsenal that we have today. Amen. I can quote. I can sing. I can do this. But the most powerful weapon in my arsenal today is the power to be able to communicate with God. To have the ear of God. To be able to pray and know that God is listening to me. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avaleth a little bit. &gt;&gt; Ah availth a much availth much. Amen. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man. Amen. Avaleth much. that communication that we have with God, the most powerful weapon in our arsenal today, church. Amen. Even brother Brandham said that the prayer is the most powerful weapon ever put into the hands of mankind. &gt;&gt; Amen. The power, the faith, Amen, shall save the sick, whatever it is. Amen. when you pray. The reformer Martin Luther said the characteristics of a cobbler is to make shoes. He said the characteristics of a of a Christian is to pray. &gt;&gt; So, well, do we pray enough? Probably not. Amen. &gt;&gt; Probably something we all could elevate our lives a little bit more, talk to him a little bit more. Amen. Cuz I don't know about you because every time I start to pray, the devil comes along with something else. Every time I want to sit down and pray and have have conversation with God, here comes the devil with something that's got this job or that job or something else or something you got to do. Always mind always battling in that mind. But once we have a breakthrough that and we have that con we enter into that spirit of prayer, we enter into that into that that avenue of communication with God. Do you know the greatest failure in relationships today is a lack of communication. You want a marriage to fail, you let the husband and wife quit communicating. You let them quit talking to one another. Amen. It will fail. You want your relationship with God to fail, you quit talking to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz he desires to hear you. He desires to hear you tell him, "I love you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he wants to tell you he loves you also. &gt;&gt; Amen. The most power you when when when the when the bride of Christ goes to her knees, hell trembles. &gt;&gt; I remember a story about DL Moody. Everybody knows DL Moody. [snorts] He went to build his church in in in in Chicago and he found a piece of property that he wanted and he went to the real estate company and he told the real estate agent, "I want to buy such and such a property down on such and such a street, such and such an address." The real estate agent was real happy because it was a valuable piece of property had a had a nice p price tag on it. And um the real estate agent said, "Well, the price is this." And Mr. Mr. Moody says, "Well, I can't pay that." He said, "Well, what can you pay?" He said, "Well, I could pay some dollar." And it was some ridiculous amount really. And he said, "Well, you may as well go on. We're not going to sell you that property." So, DL Moody left and the boss came in and he asked the agent said, "Who was that older gentleman in here?" So, all that was that preacher down the street there. So, what did he want? He wanted to buy that piece of property down the road there. Why didn't you sell it to him? He offered some ridiculous price. What did you tell him? I told him to go. He said, "Oh Lord, you should have give it to him. Now he's going to get it for free." Because Dio Muda said, "Well, I'll just pray about it." He said, "Now he's going to get it for free." So see the See, the devil recognized if if the people ever start praying, he's in trouble. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the agent, the boss told the agent said, "You should have sold it to him for what he asked. Now he's going to get it for free." Amen. Now we've got it for free. See the price has already been paid. Prayer has made it free. Amen. Prayer has opened the door. Prayer is done in everything. Effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avaleth much. Watch and pray. He said that you enter not in temptation. Amen. I told you at the beginning of the message, we're in a battle. We're fighting every day. And the the the battle that we're fighting is not conventional. And if God hadn't meant for us to fight, if he didn't know we were going to be in a fight, why did he ever give us all this armor? Amen. When you've done all that you know to do to stand stand having his feet shot with the preparation of the gospel you loan ski about with truth shield of faith the sword of the spirit. Amen. The helmet of salvation. God knew that you were going to be in a battle &gt;&gt; but he gave you everything that you needed. He did only thing he did he forgot brother Martin uh Daniel he forgot to give us anything for the backside. &gt;&gt; Wonder why he did that. wonder if why he forgive for forgot to give us anything for the backside. Could you could you believe that maybe he didn't want his people running? Amen. Away from the battle. Amen. He wanted them running toward the battle. &gt;&gt; Amen. He wanted them going going forward. Amen. There's nothing there's nothing for defeat. Listen, church. You turn your back on God, you turn away from God, you're in trouble &gt;&gt; cuz you don't have anything to defend for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. But as long as you're going forward, as long as you're facing God, as long as you're taking on the battle, as long as you're waving the weapon, let me tell you something. You got something to to to go forward with you. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You got something to go forward with. Arm yourselves. Be ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God's got an answer on the way. I love the song Brother Shelley sung last night. The answer's on the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Before you ever got sick, you were healed. Before you ever got here, you were a bride. Amen. Prophet said you were said you were a Christian before you became a Christian. Amen. The answer is already here. Before you ever got sick, healing was already on the way. Amen. God had already made provision for it. Before you ever had any situation in your life, God had already made a way. Amen. When you start praying, when you got a sickness or pain, look up because you can see the answer's already on its way. It's already on its way, church. Amen. Arm yourselves. Be ready for your adversary. Amen. To seeking whom he may devour. He went before God. See, he's he's not afraid even to approach this the the the Almighty. Amen. When the sons of God came together, the scripture said that the devil came also. &gt;&gt; And God looked at him and said, "Where you been? What you doing?" He said, "I've been out here seeking whom I may devour." Amen. Looking for somebody. Amen. When you walk out the door today, he's going to be on the outside surveying you and looking see if you got enough this morning to keep you through the rest of the week &gt;&gt; or to Tuesday night when you come back for a refreshing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You forgive me for that little those little illustrations, but he's he's aware. Amen. But but when they came together and God said, "Have you considered my servant Job?" Brother Greley, I believe he included you with Job. &gt;&gt; When he said, "Have you considered my servant Jo? I believe he included you." &gt;&gt; He wasn't just talking about Job. He was talking about you and you and you and you and you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I wasn't there." Sure you were. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But what he was saying, Amen. You've got a hedge built around him. Can you see the devil just destroying you? You got to hedge me. That's a reason. What's wrong with that? Amen. Jesus be a fence all around me every every day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is that hedge? What is that? What is that shield? Amen. I preached a little message one time on the boundaries. Stay within the boundaries. When I was growing up, Amen. the kids get ill with one another and we get kind of scuffling whether we draw a line on the sand and we dare somebody. Don't you step across that line because you step across that line, we're going to go at it. Amen. Well, let me tell you something. God's drawn a line in the sand. Amen. And he's told the devil, you can't step across that line. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may make him sick. You may take his car. You may take his house. You may ruin his bank account. But you can't touch his life because that life is my life. Amen. And you can't touch me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. The line's drawn, church. It's not drawn a line in the sand, but it's drawn a line of blood. Amen. He can't cross that bloodline. &gt;&gt; Amen. He can't come across it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Arm yourselves with the mind of Christ while the musicians come. Arm yourself with a token. You're armed with a token. You're armed with the power of prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are an overcomer. Jesus spoke about it numerous times and we've read it and the scripture says in Revelations. Amen. That if we overcome, Amen. He will grant to us that we can sit on the throne as he has overcome and sit on the throne with his father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The adversary is all around. He's He's looking for one little weak place in defense. &gt;&gt; He's looking for one little place, Amen. that maybe you haven't prayed enough this week. you haven't read your Bible enough this week. See, when we do those things, those those that prayer life and that that scripture reading, those things become weak. And when they become weak, it gives the devil access, amen, to get through to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. But if we arm oursel with with with all these things and the adversary comes, we're able to stand. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're able to overcome. We're able to defeat him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But Christ has armed his servants, amen, to battle. &gt;&gt; He's given us what we need today to be an overcomer. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Whatever, whatever, whatever the battle is, God has given you. Now, as I mentioned earlier, I heard these brothers talking about hunting. Look, [clears throat] there's all different kinds of guns. Amen. Now brothers, if I'm wrong, if I if I cross your line, you forgive me. But I have a had a friend passed away, gone on to be the with the Lord. When he go squirrel hunting, he'd go squirrel hunting with a shotgun. And I used to tell him, "You blowing that little old squirrel all the pieces. You going to have so much buck shot him, you ain't going to be eat him." I've always squirrel hunted with a rifle, with a 22 or something. And there's all different calibers and all different types of weapons. Amen. when it comes to the to the natural warfare. Amen. You go into the arsenal and you see everything from a from a slingshot of David up to a ballistic missile or what are just numerous beyond what you can imagine. It's the same way with the word of God. Listen, these three little cartridges is certainly not all that we are armed with today to be an overcomer. We have the full gospel. We have the full word of God. We have everything that God was. Amen. that he poured into Christ and that Christ poured into the church. We have every bit of that, amen, to arm ourselves to be overcomers today. &gt;&gt; And we're living under the spirit of an hour, amen, that is totally contrary to God. We're living under a spirit of the hour, amen, that is that everything about our the the the world that we live in is contrary to God. Politics, finances, everything is against God. And you have to stand. You may stand alone, but when you've done all that you know to do, don't tie a knot in the end of the rope. Stand. &gt;&gt; Amen. Stand. &gt;&gt; Having yourself armed with the armor to fight the battle. &gt;&gt; God has given it to you today. God bless you. Stand with me. &gt;&gt; I hope that we've encouraged you a little bit &gt;&gt; to give the devil one more round. &gt;&gt; Amen. Give him one more round. The next time he come, just hold up the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Say, "Here it is." Amen. I'm covered by the blood. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Father, thank you for your precious word today in your spirit. Thank you for the song service and the movement of the Holy Spirit that we felt within our midst this morning. I pray that we've been able to say something that will encourage the hearts of your people. I pray that you take it with the cords of Holy Spirit and bind it up in a spirit of love and give it to them and let them know Lord how much I appreciate them and how much I hope that the word of God has been a blessing to them. Keep us all in the center of your perfect word in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. Let's give the Lord a big clap offering. Tell him I have the victory. [applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Worthy of every song we could ever sing. &gt;&gt; Worthy of all the praise we could ever bring. Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe. We live for you.

Lord, show us, show us, Lord, those around us that you have positioned there that our life could make a difference in theirs. The warfare is going on whether we're participating or not. Father, would you give us the grace? Some have not been fighting. Some have been just taking the punches. Would you raise us up today? &gt;&gt; It may look different for one than it does another, but may we leave here today determined &gt;&gt; to take our place on the battlefield. And as your prophet said, to defeat the enemy before it defeats us. &gt;&gt; You have equipped us with all that we need. Your word is life. It's greater than the atomic bomb when we pray, when we call on you. Lord, thank you for giving us access. &gt;&gt; Thank you for telling us to come as we are. We don't have to get good enough to call out. We call out and you come and you cleanse and you deliver and you free us. Thank you. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Would you just lift your hand to him and thank him that he's taking care of all that needs to be taken care of as we yield different layers of our life to him. He walks us through the present. He walks us through the past. He prepares us for the future. That's who he is. Lord, we thank you that the battle belongs to you and the most that we do is show up, take you at your word and use the arsenal that you have provided. We magnify your name right now. We glorify your name. We give you praise and honor and glory. I want to say we got the power. I think it we've got the power in the name of Jesus. [music] We've got the power. It's in the name of the Lord. No, Satan [music] [singing] raes. We cannot be defeated. We've got the power. It's in the name of the Lord. I want you to sing it like you [music] mean it. We've got the power. It's in the name of Jesus. We have the authority to We've got the power. It's in the name [singing] of the Lord. No, Satan raes. We [music] cannot be defeated. We've got the power. It's in the name of the [singing] Lord. For many years now, oh, Satan's tried to stop us. But the bride of Jesus, [music and singing] oh she is still alive like a mighty army. We keep maring [music] onward, winning every battle. Woo! Been the Lord by our [singing and music] side. Sing it. We've got you provided it, Lord, in [music] the name of We've [music] got the power. [singing] It's in the name of the Lord. [singing] No. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord. Sing this [music] verse. Oh, give me [singing] your hand. And let's agree together [singing and music] that all of our eneies will crumble at our feet. For whatever we bind on earth, it's already been bound in heaven. And at the name of Jesus, [music] oh, Satan has to flee. I still believe he has to flee. We've got the power. Glory. Hallelujah. Oh, we've got the power. You gave it to us. Glory in the name of the Lord. You know, [music] take it. That's right. That's right. You take it. We take it. We receive it. We've got to move [music] it in the name [singing] of the Lord. Sing this part again. For many years [music] now, oh, Satan's tried to stop us. [music] But the little bride of Jesus, [music and singing] we are still alive, still fighting, [music] still pressing like a mighty army. We keep marching [music] onward. We're winning every battle with the Lord by our side. [music] The last time. Sing it. We've got the power [music] and it's in the name of Jesus. [singing] Woo. We've got it's in the name of the Lord. [singing] Though Satan rages and he howls and he huffs and puffs and he rages, [music] he cannot defeat the word in you. We've got [music] In the name of [music] the Lord. [singing] Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a shout. Hallelujah. [screaming] &gt;&gt; That was pretty good for Methodist. Let's do it one more time. Let's give him a real shout. Would you do it with me now? Hallelujah. [screaming] Hallelujah to the King of Kings. He reigns. &gt;&gt; He triumphs. &gt;&gt; He's our victory. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to hear me carefully. Can you play something that'll make people listen to me? something soft and and sweet. I I want to say just a few things and it won't take me long. I know what you're thinking and I know I know I know I get it. But I'm going to obey the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If it hair liips the devil and bankrupts hell. &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you what he laid on my heart. A couple of things quickly. One is you may not be comfortable with the analogy of a gun or war, but you don't get to choose what's already written in the book. &gt;&gt; This whole journey as a believer has been it has been compared to war, warfare, fighting, swords, &gt;&gt; the whole armor of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. breastplate, helmet. &gt;&gt; You You don't dress up like that to go to a wedding. &gt;&gt; You dress up like that to go to a battle. &gt;&gt; And maybe you're just waking up to the fact that you're in a battle. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But you're not going to win the battle with sweet talk. &gt;&gt; You're going to have to win it with faith &gt;&gt; and by using the weapons that we have been given. &gt;&gt; Um, guns make me nervous a little bit. And so, um, when when [music] our brother said, "I'm going to have a little illustration in the bag," you know, I'm thinking he's going to bring out a little, I don't know, a cup and some water or some little I had no idea it'd be metal and shaped like that. So, I have to be honest and tell you, made me a little bit nervous, especially as it's going around in the air. He's holding it up to his head. But the reality, &gt;&gt; I get it. &gt;&gt; And it touched me. It spoke to me. &gt;&gt; And and and he's right. You'll never forget it. &gt;&gt; And what he spoke was the truth and nothing but the truth. And here's what the Lord took me to in in a message that I would have we're we're almost to to page uh 36 in the Samson series. We're almost there. and and I'm glad I had the weekend off cuz I've been blessed. But this is where we would have been. Now listen at what he said. This is from the message just once more Lord. This was 1963, [music] December the 1st of 1963 in Shriefport. There's a V in Shreveport. Brother Brandham didn't seem to know that there's a V there. Shrivefeport. And I noticed that Jordan uh Peterson was here and he kept saying it just like brother Brandham said. Shreport. There's a V there. Shriveport. And here's what brother Brandham tells us in paragraph 125 and 126. And I want you to hear this carefully and you will have it if you could find it and put it up. He said, "Listen, destroy your enemy." &gt;&gt; Before your enemy destroys you. &gt;&gt; Now, he's preaching on Samson. &gt;&gt; Destroy your enemy before your enemy destroys you. He said he'll do it. Bring back the oldfashioned meetings &gt;&gt; and the thing and oh, leave Delilah alone. &gt;&gt; Leave the world alone. The thing that woos you off into little things that you shouldn't. &gt;&gt; The reality is some of you don't need the internet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Disconnect it. You don't need it. Come on. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I can't live without it." You did &gt;&gt; and you will again. &gt;&gt; Some of us don't need cell phones. We don't need them &gt;&gt; because it I don't know if there's payoneses or not, but you can always borrow somebody's phone. But sometimes it's really good to put away, to separate ourselves, to defeat the enemy, to destroy the enemy &gt;&gt; before he destroys us. &gt;&gt; Some people are going to have to make radical decisions. &gt;&gt; Now, if you don't believe that's biblical, you didn't read the red letters. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because in the red letters he said if your eye offends you what he said. &gt;&gt; Now now he was not suggesting that we physically pluck out our eye. What he was suggesting is that we become radically committed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To doing whatever is within our power to defeat our enemy &gt;&gt; before he defeats us. &gt;&gt; If your right arm offend you, he said cut it off. It'd be better to go through life maim and be whole in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; He's not telling you to amputate the members of your of your flesh. This body is to be honored because it's the gift of God to you. But he is telling us that sometimes we have to be radical about destroying what the enemy is sending toward us to destroy us. &gt;&gt; Anybody feel any witness on that? He said, "Leave the world alone, the thing that woos you off into little things that you shouldn't." He said, "And little things, troubles, uh, come up in the church and you won't stand correction because you don't have to. You can drop off to another church and things like that." In the early days, when a man didn't cope up with the word of God, they packed him out. dead. And I want you to see what brother 1963 December 1st seals are preached. And I want you to see what he says in the very next paragraph. Bring us back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you are you listening? &gt;&gt; Bring us back to Pentecost. He's not talking about denominational Pentecost. &gt;&gt; He's talking about birth &gt;&gt; and experience. Brother Brandham said, "I'm Pentecostal from the top of my head to the soles of my feet." &gt;&gt; Not denominational, but by personal experience. Bring us back to Pentecost. Not Hollywood showmanship, but a wholehearted turn to God is what we need. Once more, oh Lord. &gt;&gt; Once more. That's my amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's my amen to what we heard today. &gt;&gt; We must destroy our enemy &gt;&gt; before he destroys us. God, grant us grant us the grace &gt;&gt; and the faith and the and the radical commitment &gt;&gt; to do whatever we need to do within reason, within the parameters of your word, &gt;&gt; and within the in the realm of common sense. because some people are missing it. Grant us that that we don't do anything that would not be pleasing to you. But Lord, if a separation from something is what we need, give us grace. I'd rather be embarrassed to say, "Can I borrow your phone for a phone call?" than to have that thing in my pocket and constantly war with looking at something that is not edifying &gt;&gt; and pleasing to God. There is no condemnation in what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; I I I know the struggle. I know how he operates. But you've got the power. &gt;&gt; I have the power. It's in the name. It's in the word. It's in the pardon. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus signed my pardon. We sang. &gt;&gt; This I surely know. Took my place at Calvary so I don't have to go. All my life I give him. He gave his for me when he signed my pardon at Calvary. How many of you believe he signed your pardon? &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Glory be to God. Glory be to God. Just just give me a moment. We're closing. Glory. Thank you, Jesus. Lord, as we leave this place today, I want to just a minute. I'm coming out of prayer moment. I want to acknowledge Sister Jada. Uh, not that it needs to be acknowledged, but I want to I want you all to know that that took a lot. That's not her nature to do like that. But she did that uh spontaneous and inspired because she's been fighting some battles. She's been going through something and she's making some some preparation for the victory that God has. And she she put that that banner together and she wanted to use that. And I sent her I sent her this. Let Let me read you one more thing. I knew you'd get up behind Brother John and preach. Well, you know, I I don't even feel like apologizing. Uh u I I got my own parking place here. So, I I'm I got some attachment to this place. I wonder I want to read you quickly what he said. He said, "You know, there's something about about song that's got power in it." &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. He said, 'We aware of that. That said, look at look at the army when they sing the songs and play the music. Do you know the approach to war in the army of God is first by music? &gt;&gt; He said the singers went before the ark &gt;&gt; rejoicing and singing. Then come the ark and then the battle. How many of you know the ark represented the presence? So the singing went first, the presence followed behind, and what was next? &gt;&gt; The battle. &gt;&gt; God preparing for the battle that's coming. He said the singers went before the ark, rejoicing and singing. Then come the ark and then the battle. That's right. So he said that's the right approach. And the that's the reason we come in the service at night. What do we do? We sing the hymns of the Lord and then the ark. The word. Read the word and then the battle. &gt;&gt; Now is the battle. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right here. It's in these moments after the word goes forth that a decision is made. &gt;&gt; Every time. Every time. We're making a decision now. Are we going to take this word and use it to whip the devil? &gt;&gt; Or are we going to let a few things that we don't get or or things uh that we don't understand exactly, are we going to let that keep us from receiving any of it? I'm taking it all. I'm taking it all. Back to what he said. He said, "So, uh, that's the reason we come in the service. Sing the hymns of the Lord, then the ark, the word, read the word, and then the battle we're in." He said, "So the great banners are flying." That's right. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; The great banners are flying tonight. The name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Somebody say that's it. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; The Lord God may be exalted and the enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be put to flight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "And God win the victory tonight. Save souls. Heal the sick and the afflicted. cause those that are weary and stooped low to raise up their heads and rejoice &gt;&gt; get great glory unto himself. For we ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; So I just wanted you to know that that is absolutely scriptural to make up your mind. I'm going to win this thing. I'm going to declare the name of Jesus over every situation and every circumstance of my life. How many of you believe it works? &gt;&gt; Father, go with us today. Pour strength and virtue and rest and peace into our brother &gt;&gt; uh as he plans to leave us later this afternoon and drive a little piece of the way. Lord, would you take him safely all the way home in your timing? And would you refresh him and renew him and reward him for being your mouthpiece to us, a vessel to us? There were so many nuggets this morning, so many precious treasures that I can hold on to and I can wave them like a banner in victory and I can use them like weapons against the enemy of my own soul. Thank you for brother John Thornton. Thank you for the call of God on his life. And thank you for sustaining him these years and beyond to do your will, to do your work. H in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ, go with us and keep us all. And the saint said, &gt;&gt; and the saint said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." I love what I feel right now. It's just peace. I just take peace with me. and and I take it and I sometimes you have to use that to defeat the enemy. Wonderful peace. Every need you have can be met because of his wonderful presence that's here. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. I want us to uh sing as we leave. Victory is mine. Amen. You're dismissed to go tonight or this afternoon in the name of the Lord. Tuesday night at 7:00. You know you know what's next. God bless you as you go. Victory is mine. Victory is mine. Victory today is mine. Go home and get [music] your lunch and bring it back quickly. There's plenty for everybody. If you didn't bring any, you [music] go down anyway and we'll be there when we can. Victory is my [music] victory. Oh, victory today is mine. Oh, now I told Satan get my victory today. Amen. Victory is mine. Oh, there's so many. Victory today is mine. Well, now I told [music] Satan, you get me behind. Victory today is mine. One more time. Victory [music] is mine. Victory is mine. Victory [music] today is mine. Lord, oh Satan, get me behind. Thank you, honey. Oh, [music] thank you. Oh, that's amazing.
