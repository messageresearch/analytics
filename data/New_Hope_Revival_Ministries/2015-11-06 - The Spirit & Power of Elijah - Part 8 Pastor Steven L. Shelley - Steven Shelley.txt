TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] oh [Music] [Music] you're watching the Eagles cry I'm Pastor Steven Shelly and I want to welcome you to the broadcast today we're in the middle of a study series on the spirit and power of Elijah past present and future and we're learning so many things about the character the the attributes uh even the demonstr ations of the power of God in the life of Elijah the prophet and the reason why we're studying it is because the scripture has promised that this spirit will return this power this anointing will return to the earth a number of times we also believe that in this generation it's getting time for the spirit and power of Elijah that same kind of raw anointing to fall on the lives of a Remnant body of believers so that we can rise up and see the work of the Kingdom forwarded in a mighty way we want to see the works of the enemy exposed and his influence over many many lives broken and we want to see the kingdom of God established in the hearts of men and women in every nation of the world does that seem like an impossible task well it will if your only source of inspiration is the daily news but if your source of inspiration is like mine from the word of God from the quickening of the spirit of God then you'll understand that the darker it gets out there the brighter it must become in the life of every believer and that is possible if we keep our minds and our lives focused on the Lord you know you often become like what you focus on what you gaze on and so I encourage you to turn your heart your attention full attention to the word of God to the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ look at him and live do you remember those children of Israel when they were were stricken by a plague of serpents and they began to bite them and the word of the Lord came and to Moses to put up a brass serpent on a pole and all that looked upon Him shall live the Bible tells us in the Gospel of John in the same manner that that serpent was raised up even our Lord Jesus was raised up on the cross on the on the execution Pole or stake and those who look upon him can live and the plague can be stopped in your life so I encourage you to look to Jesus and live turn your back on false religion turn your back on on the mere traditions and fables of men and believe the god of the Bible he is a real God and he wants to bring deliverance and help in your life now don't you hold on to the god of your childhood and the god of the Bible at the same time you've got to be willing to reject the god that only exists in the minds of men and women and find faith in the god of the Bible Jehovah God the god of the Old Testament and the New Testament The God Who so loved this world that He Sent His only begotten son in fact the Bible said in John 1:1 the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word became flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth and this is the love story that God loved you so much that he came to this earth in the likeness of sinful flesh so that he could walk in your shoes so to speak he could understand the the trials and pains of living in this present world living in a real world where where Satan is the prince of the power of the air our Lord did that as our example and today he lives and to make intercession for us before the father he is our great high priest and we we know that according to the scripture he he fulfills that role because of his Earthly walk because he walked here on the earth and the scripture says that he is moved he is touched with the feeling of our infirmities that means he knows what you're going through and loves you and wants to bring help and hope and deliverance in your life if you'll just open up your heart and let him we're talking about the characteristics of the Prophet Elijah so that we can help identify that spirit and power of Elijah in past generations and moving forward we want to know that when that Spirit of Elijah and that power of Elijah comes into the Earth lest the Earth be smitten with a curse Malachi 4:5 and6 tells us we want to be able to recognize it to identify with that spirit and power and even cooperate with it with our lives we've been talking about on the last broadcast how that Elijah was called by God equipped by God to confront the spirit of Jezebel which is a spirit of manipulation and control we read in the scripture that Ahab was already Wicked in his heart as the king of Israel but that that wickedness just magnified it became even more effective over the nation when he married Jezebel the name Jezebel is a Phoenician name in origin and it means her lack of submission and her infidelities proved that true marriage meant nothing to her you see to Jezebel marriage was just a way to advance her agenda it was a way to control the nation using King Ahab her husband as the tool to carry out her own plans thoughts and agendas for the nation she was advancing the worst worship of the god bael and she was using Ahab to get it done this is how the spirit of Jezebel works today in the government of Nations around the world and this is also how the spirit of Jezebel seeks to control the Church of the Living God by manipulating and controlling legitimate leadership until this leadership becomes corrupted and perverted and then it is no longer genuine in the sight of God but only a a veil of deception that causes people to go further and further away from righteousness and Holiness no wonder we say we need a move of God in the in this hour we do need a move of God we need Elijah to rise up we need men and women with the spirit and power of Elijah who are not afraid of that Spirit of Jezebel men and women who can go down on their knees in war this is how we fight we fight on our knees if we want to see the spirit of Jezebel and her influence broken in our nation we go down on our knees if we want to see our churches cleaned out of that Spirit of control and manipulation that Jezebel brings we go down on our knees and that's where we win this battle I like the fact that there's power in prayer and that God god Jehovah is still on the throne he's still winning battles now in fact Jezebel's name meant un cohabitation or no cohabitation Jezebel would not cohabit that means she wouldn't dwell with a partner as partners she wanted to be in control her weapons were many seduction coercion manipulation humiliation deception flattery slander whatever was necessary to take control of every situation that's what Jezebel would use Jezebel's treachery toward an innocent and righteous man whose name was naboth marked the beginning of the end for her and King Ahab many of us know that story why don't I just turn over here and read just a portion of that to you in first Kings CH 21 verse 1 and it came to pass after these things that naboth the jezreelite had a Vineyard which was in jezrael hard by the Palace of Ahab king of Samaria and Ahab spake unto naboth saying give me that Vineyard that I may have it as a garden of herbs because it is near unto my house and I will give thee for it a better Vineyard than it or if it seem Good To Thee I will give Thee the worth of it in money in other words I'll either trade you a parcel of land or I'll pay you a fair price for it and naboth oh my naboth said to Ahab the king the Lord forbid it me that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee do don't you like the courage and the Integrity of naboth he stood up this wasn't the king's servant he was standing up to this was the king himself he said the Lord will not allow me to take my inheritance and give it to you now nabo was not only a man of strong conviction who valued his inheritance he also understood that according to the Torah the instructions of God to the children of Israel that it was forbidden for him to devalue his inheritance in this manner and give it to another one and so naboth was not just standing up for his own personal convictions he was also standing up for the instruction of God's word I like that I like that I appreciate the courage of of naboth God give me that kind of Courage that I can say to this world I'm not for sale what God has given me as my inheritance is not for sale we ought to rise up in the spirit wherever you are right now watching this and say to the enemy of our soul I am not for sale my family my children my church my community my nation is not for sale God forbid you old devil that I would give my inheritance into your hands I'll Stand and and defend that which God has invested in my life verse four said and Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased oh poor Ahab because of the word which naboth the jezreelite had spoken to him for he had said I will not give Thee the inheritance of my fathers and he laid him down upon his bed and turned away and would eat no bread now does doesn't that sound like a pouting child here is the king of the Northern Kingdom of Israel and he's pouting like a little two-year-old but that's all right because that's exactly the kind of situation that Jezebel was waiting on so that she could slip in and use her power of manipulation and control verse five shows us that but Jezebel his wife came to him and said unto him why is thy can't you just hear her why is your spirit so sad uh sweetheart that you would eat no bread real sympathy not really just put on and he said unto her because I spake unto nabbo the jesrael and told him said unto him give me thy Vineyard for money uh and she he describes the deal that he offered and verse 7 said and Jezebel his wife said unto him Dost thou now govern the Kingdom of Israel in other words aren't you the king aren't you the one in control arise and eat bread let me fix you a little snack honey Dost thou now govern the kingdom arise and eat bread and let thine heart be merry listen to what she says I will give Thee the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite here how that Spirit Works she took advantage of this pouty husband she stepped right in and said I will give you how is she going to give it was it hers was it in her power could she just take it away from him I want you to know she was powerless without the pen of Ahab without the surrendered authority of Ahab if he hadn't been so weak and so much like what sometimes we say like a noodle you you know how how a noodle when you boil it it it first it starts off really stiff and you boil it in water and it becomes all soft and this is how Ahab was he was like a spaghetti noodle and this is just exactly what what uh Jezebel needed to step in and start working her dirty work and so what she did was she wrote letters in ahab's name do you understand she didn't have enough Authority on her own so she had to find another authority to work through namely the authority of Ahab you better watch that Spirit of Jezebel it's alive today it's in the world world today it's in our governments and Nations today it's in our churches today we need Elijah to rise up who'll pray against that Spirit of Jezebel so she gets out and she starts writing letters in ahab's name and she takes his seal see illegitimate Authority she takes his seal and uses it to seal those letters and sent them to the elders and Nobles in the city dwelling around nabbo and wrote WR him these letters saying proclaim a fast and set naboth on high among the people see she's going to lift him up so she can rip him down and it goes on that a fast was declared and it goes on that there came in two men children of bile and sat before him and the men of B witnessed against him even against nabo she found people who would lie against naboth a servant of God in the presence of the people accusing naboth of blasphemy fing the Lord and the King Then They Carried him forth out of the city and stoned him with stones until he died nabbo murdered because Ahab wanted a herb garden I want you to know wicked things like that happen in the world that we live in today and as long as Jezebel's Spirit goes unconfronted these things will continue to happen in church families in church assemblies all over over the world righteous men dying by the wayside paying the price so that Jezebel can uh you know keep Ahab happy so that when she wants to advance her agenda she can keep using his seal and signing letters in his name they sent word to Jezebel in verse 14 that naboth was stoned and dead and it came to pass when she heard it that that it had happened that she said to Ahab arise and take possession of the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite which he refused to give thee for money for he is not alive but dead and it came to pass when naboth heard that that I mean when Ahab heard that naboth was dead that he arose up to go down to the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite to take possession of it you see Satan just wants to move you off of your inheritance so that he can come in and take possession of it and and this is how he works I think I'm getting a little stirred up about this because this does raise up some holy indignation in me I don't know how many times I might have allowed that Spirit to do that in my own life surrendering to the devil the things that God had given to me because of a spirit of intimidation because of a spirit of manipulation and coercion and the way that thing works is you think you're calling the shots you think you're doing what you want to do not realizing that you're yielding to the spirit of control that someone else is Anointed by oh my we need naboth's and Elijah to raise up in this hour but don't you worry God knows how to get a hold of that situation he knows how to do something about it in the church this Spirit of Jezebel seeks to bring about Unholy alliances that weaken the foundations of a Ministry you get a couple people licking their wounds together bearing one another's offenses and the next thing you know they cause a ripple effect that goes through the entire body all of that influenced by the spirit of Jezebel we need prayer warriors on their watch in this hour there's no doubt about it and if you'll if you'll remember in second Kings chapter 9: 30 Jezebel got ready to greet juu now now this ju who a a a a word of the Lord in his mouth uh a prophetic man but also he would have position as a future leader as a future king and so Jezebel was not just Satisfied by weakening the influence of this present generation she began to see how she could work on juu she began to see just how she could position herself to control the Next Generation now that sounds just like the enemy if he can weaken the mothers and the fathers then where do the children have a chance if if he can weaken one generation in their conviction in their stand for the holy word of God then what does the Next Generation have other than a weak and compromised and watered down Faith the true foundation of Christianity the the the word of God the god of the Bible has been so watered down and so compromised in this hour until if something doesn't happen to shift this generation this thing will continue to be so watered down it won't take long and you won't know Christianity from any other false religion now that's a hard word but it's nothing but the truth so here she goes in after the Next Generation I think probably her goal was to to hope that something would happen that she could marry ju eventually and control but if not she at least wanted to be able to pull the strings of his mind and so in 2 Kings chapter 9 and verse 30 uh and all the way through several verses there I think it goes down to about verse 37 we begin to read about the beginning of the end here uh she got ready to meet ju she heard he was coming and so she got up at the top of the wall this wasn't just a casual hello welcome to the city she had a an agenda for sure the Bible said she painted her eyes she picked out the most alluring gown seductive dress that she could find and she planned a seductive maneuver to entice juu Israel's 10th King and to lure him into forming an alliance with her perhaps like I said a moment ago by becoming his wife but if nothing else she sought to intimidate ju verse 30 and when ju was come to Jezebel or excuse me to Jezreel Jezebel heard it and she painted her face and tired her head and looked out at a window and as ju entered in at the gate she said had zimy peace who slew his master and he lifted up his face to the window and said who is on my side that's a bold move who and there looked out to him two or three Unix the Bible tells us verse 33 and he said throw her down and so they threw her down uh so somebody in the palace realized what was going on there was somebody in the King's house that grieved over the lack of Integrity in the life of Ahab the king there was somebody who said I can't allow this to continue on and so when ju said just deal with this Spirit once and for all throw her down now this isn't the way we deal with the Jezebel spirit today we deal with it on our knees but this was another era of time there there was another way of dealing with things in in the older Covenant and so they threw her down and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the horses and he troed underfoot and when he was come in he did eat and drink and said go see now this cursed woman and bury her for she is the King's Daughter and they went to bury her but they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands wherefore they came again and told him and he said this is the word of the Lord which he spake by his servant Elijah the tishbite saying in the portion of jezrael shall dogs eat the Flesh of Jezebel and the carcass of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of jezrael so they shall say not so they shall not say say this is Jezebel see Elijah had already prophesied the ultimate defeat of Jezebel but it was not until God used a juu to actually carry out this ultimate defeat and and cause her influence to be broken the thing is we're not dealing with a natural Jezebel we're dealing with the spirit and so if that Spirit uses one person and that person is removed or dies or gets delivered that Spirit just looks to find someone El else that it can work through and someone else that it can control and manipulate and so we've got to get on our prayer bones as the oldtimers used to say and touch God although the breaking of the Jezebel spirit or influence in Israel began with Elijah it was not completed until the next generation and this is very important for us to remember because really uh it appears that some of that responsibility is falling on us and this hour remember that God told Elijah to anoint juu king of Israel but it was actually during Elisha's time that that that that fulfillment was carried out this is a proper there is a proper time for everything even for the Fulfillment of God's instructions listen carefully to what I'm about to share with you the responsibility to deal with the Jezebel spirit that for too long has had control over the Church of the Living God falls on this generation are you willing to take up that task we must contend for the spirit and power of Elijah to anoint us to take authority over that Spirit of control we must not shy away from this responsibility now in order to do that we're going to have to look inward we're going to have to do some searching and I'll share that with you in the next broadcast I want to pray for you right now I want to ask the Lord to begin to reveal to you uh situations that you might be in where the spirit of Jezebel or a spirit like unto Jezebel is trying to control and manipulate and hold back the advancement of the kingdom of God if God begins to reveal that to you and release strategy and anointing and authority to deal with it you're going to have to rise up to the task father I ask you right now in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ to begin to unveil reveal expose ways that the spirit of Jezebel has sought to control leadership in the Nations and in the Church of the Living God and let there be those under the sound of my voice who have been positioned and prepared and equipped by the Holy Spirit to rise up under the spirit and power of Elijah to deal with that Spirit of manipulation and control we say to the enemy you're being exposed now and your kingdom is about to crumble Lord I ask for strength and wisdom and courage and integrity to rise up in your people across the world in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ well amen you have the power to begin to pray and let God use you in the spirit to break the influence of that old Wicked Jezebel spirit I want to thank you for uh sticking with me through this intense topic I want to invite you to come back next time and watch another episode of the eagle cry if we can be a blessing to you in your prayer life send us a prayer request God bless you bye-bye for now [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music]
