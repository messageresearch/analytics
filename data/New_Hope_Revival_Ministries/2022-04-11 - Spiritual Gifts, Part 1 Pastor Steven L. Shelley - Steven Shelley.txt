where jesus is and he's holding out his hair and the wings are calling out my name and they laugh at me they're reminding me of all the times i've tried and before waves they keep on telling me just time and time again before you'll never win no you'll never win but the voice of truth tells me a different story the voice of true says do not be afraid in the voice of truth says this is for my glory out of all the voices calling out to me [Music] oh i will choose to listen and believe [Music] do [Music] surrounded by the sounds of a thousand warriors just to shaking in their armor just a wishing they'd have had the strength to stand but the giant's calling out my name and he laughs at me oh he's reminding me of all the times i've tried before and failed and the giant keeps on telling me for time and time again [Music] it tells me a different story the voice of truth says do not be afraid and the voice of truth says this is for my glory out of all the voices calling out to me and i will choose to listen and believe the voice but the voice of truth tells me a different story the voice of truth says do not be afraid the voice of truth says this is for my glory the moon the voice is calling out to me i will choose i will choose to listen and believe the voice of true i want us to take just a moment and i want you to think about what you're singing this morning because as sure as we're gathered here in the name of the lord there are voices in your head and they're telling you all kinds of things and that enemy will come to church with you and he'll sit through the service with you and he'll go home with you and he'll go to work with you and he'll tell you constantly you'll never win you'll never live an overcoming christian life you don't have what it takes to live above sin but i want you to know he's a liar he's the father of all lies his lies go all the way back to the garden and he's defeated by the redemptive blood of the lord jesus christ and i want you to know that god if if if this was his plan he could override that and he could force you to believe him but that is not the way he created this universe he gave you and i the ability to make that choice and we don't make it once and for all we make it once and for all and then we continue to make it over and over and over and over again i choose to listen to the voice of truth this morning i choose to believe that god is greater greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world i choose to believe that if i will stop trying so hard and let him live this life through me that i will be able to live a successful testimony of the grace of the lord jesus so i want us to sing that verse again because i love that part about all the israeli army and every one of them every one of them would have liked to have been a david every one of them would have liked to have had that strength that day but god had placed his anointing on david and the rest of them were standing there shaking in their army ready to flee from the enemy but david had to go he had to go he had to go he had to be obedient he had to make a choice he had to listen to the voice of truth i want us to sing it again and i want you to make a choice again maybe you made it when you woke up this morning maybe you made it earlier in the worship but i want you to make a choice again to listen to the voice of truth to silence the voices of the enemy that will tell you all kinds of lies and choose to believe the one who said i am the truth i am the way i am the life we have to do it yes yes oh what i would do to have the kind of strength it takes to stand before a giant [Music] with just a sling and a stone surrounded by the sound of the thousand warriors just a shaking in their armor and wishing they'd have had the strength to stand but the giant's calling out my name and he laughs at me he's just reminding me of all those times i've tried before and failed but the child keeps on telling me just time and time again you'll never win no you'll never win but the voice of truth tells me a different story the voice of truth and the says of truth says this is for my glory out of all the voices calling out to me and i will choose to listen and believe the voice but the voice of truth tells me a different story the voice of truth says do not be afraid and the voice of truth says this is for my glory paul the voice is calling out to me [Applause] [Music] but the voice of truth tells me a different story the voice of truth says do not be afraid and the voice of true says this is for my glory out of all the voices calling out to me [Music] yes i will choose to listen and believe the voice and the voice of truth tells me a different story the voice [Music] says for my glory for the voice is [Music] [Music] i choose to believe you lord [Music] hallelujah and this is my story [Music] this is my soul i'm praising my savior [Music] this is my story this is my song praising my savior [Music] assure jesus is mine oh what a fourth [Applause] [Music] that's what the voice of truth tells me i'm born of his spirit [Music] sing with me this is my story oh this is my story this is my soul [Music] praising my sins [Music] this is my story this is [Music] [Music] i'm glad for the voice of truth the lord jesus christ and he uses his word that's how he defeated the enemy that's how we defeat the enemy by the word the word says i'm born of his spirit i'm washed in his blood i have blessed assurance it's not any good that i have done but it's by the blood of the spotless lamb that i can stand and know that he's fighting every giant on my behalf i'm just standing with his voice the voice of truth and as we go to prayer today that's what we're going with we're going with the weapon of the

voice cares all past home at last ever to rejoice as i journey through the land singing as i go pointing souls to calvary to the crimson flow many arrows pierce my soul from without within but my lord leads me on through him i must win and oh i want to see him look upon his face dare to sing forever of his saving grace on the streets of glory let me lift my voice cares all fast home at last never to rejoice when in valleys low i look toward the mountain height and behold my savior there leading in the fight and with a tender hand outstretched toward the valley low guiding me i can see as i onward go and oh i want to see him look upon his face there to sing forever of his saving grace on the streets of glory let me lift my voice cares i'll pass home at last ever to rejoice another verse when before me pillows rise from the mighty deep then my lord directs my bark heat us safely and deletes me gently on through this world below he's a real friend to me oh let's stand together and all i want to see him look upon [Music] on the streets of glory let me let my poor past voice last ever to rejoice [Music] one more time [Music] look upon [Music] how many of you are looking forward to seeing the lord [Music] my what a promise we have [Applause] i plan to really see him face to face you may be seated this is what the word tells us and we believe it and i want to add my greetings to brother greeley and thank the visitors for being here today because we have so many of our home folks out and it's really nice to see someone sitting in their seats and uh we appreciate that we have come to glorify the lord uh conchita would you sing what if we brought you the mic i want you to know this i want you to know whether you do or not i'm i would love to have heard you i want you to know that she's got a real anointed voice written songs for the lord and i love her i love a lot of folks but you know when you get with somebody that has that kind of an anointing on them you appreciate it i'm so thankful that god calls us he doesn't leave us he doesn't forsake us he walks with us we had a wonderful celebration yesterday for the life of brother steve curry and i believe that he was pleased i believe that the lord would somehow allow him to know that he made a difference in so many people's lives and i want you to know that if circumstances would have been different the building would not have held the people that would have come and would have liked to have been there to give honor but the church the pentecostal church in lagrange was full and i didn't even know there was a balcony up there i thought that was a sound sound system at some time but come to find out there was a balcony up there and people were there and there was some standing up what i appreciate the most was the presence of the lord that was there from from start to finish and uh i truly believe that when a believer goes home they they don't just rest and you know lay around and do nothing like some people have this idea of soul sleep i don't believe in soul sleep i want you to know that i believe they join the great cloud of witnesses and i believe they are doing ministry from a different dimension it's a spiritual thing now and they're interceding and they're praying for you and i and i'm not catholic and i don't pray to the saints but i want you to know the bible said we are compassed about by such a great cloud of witnesses somebody asked me one time why would they care why would they even care they made it why would they even care what's going on down here well the bible said they without us the scripture said they without us are not complete it's vitally important for them that you and i run all the way because the truth is they're not going into the fullness i know that i know that church theology says all kinds of things and i know in our minds we would like to place our brother right at the feet of jesus and we know that he's there in the presence of the lord but the scripture says that the dead in christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together to meet them in the air and then we go and meet the fullness of who the lord is and so we believe that the righteous dead are in the presence of the lord where there is no worry there's no pain there's no trouble there's no bad reports there's no cancer there's no heart disease there's no headaches it's just joy all joy they're not becoming angels [Music] they're not coming back as cardinals or june bugs i knew somebody one time that said i would very much like to step on that bug this was somebody that ought to know better said i'd very much like to crush that bug but it might be a lost uncle or a lost aunt i said i'd like to step on you you surely don't think such a thing as that now i know that i know that what the lord will do is he will send signs to us and he'll send reminders to us of our loved ones and i know people that have seen butterflies and and felt the presence of their loved one i'm not against that but that butterfly is not our loved one that's just god kissing us and saying don't you forget anybody you mad at me i'm just telling you the truth i've been in the spirit in some of those heavenly places and i've never seen those babies with diapers playing harps people have in their mind is not exactly like it's going to be but i want you to know when we get there we're going to know it all everything is going to be revealed to us and we're going to know it and i want you to know that as much as our brother loved us as much as he loved us he would never be able to leave that atmosphere where he is now as much as he loved his family there's just nothing that compares with knowing the race is run just one whisper well done from the lips of the one you've served all these years i i appreciate sister green singing all these years so many times she sang the song it will be worth it all when we see jesus all of us trials and heartaches and sorrows will seem as nothing when we behold his beauty you may think it's just a fairy tale but i want you to know it's it's reality and it's more real than the air that you breathe right now heaven is not a fantasy it's a it's a reality it's actual it's literal and you and i are going to enjoy that one of these days if you believe that say amen so today is sister jaya's birthday hold up your hand sister jaya we want to say happy birthday to you we love you god bless you thursday is brother r.j's mom sister karen's birthday i don't know if she would be streaming this service or not but if not somebody let her know that we're sending happy birthday greetings to her and i don't see the mans today but next saturday is sister sandy man's birthday they're going to be out of town next weekend but uh perhaps they're streaming the service now and if they are we want to say god bless you how about let's get into god's word is that all right would you mind to stand one more time all right sit back down do you want music or do you want to do it acapella all right i'm actually gonna sing her song all right do it it was such a lovely day [Music] the sun was shining bright [Music] the gentle winds were blowing my way not a storm cloud was inside [Music] but then certainly without warning a storm surrounded my life but even in the storm i could feel the calm and here's the reason why i know the peace speaker hallelujah i know him by name i do i know the peace speaker he controls the winds and waves when he says peace be oh they have to obey they have to obey they have to obey i know the peace speaker yes i know him by name praise the lord there's never been another man with the power of this frame by simply saying peace be still come on tell it he can calm the strongest wings thank you lord that's why i never worry when the storm clouds come my way cause i know that he is near he'll drive away my fears and i can smile and say that i know the peace speaker i know him by name i know the peace speakers he controls the winds and waves oh yes he does when he says [Music] they have to obey they have to obey i know the peace speaker [Laughter] peace peace [Music] peace [Music] [Music] forever [Music] [Music] for i know the peace i know him by name yes [Music] jesus speaker he controls the winds and waves when he says peace be still hallelujah they have to obey they have to obey because jesus is the peace speaker yes yes and we know him by name glory glory jesus is the peace speaker just call out his name hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] praise the lord [Applause] [Music] praise the lord know him do you know the peace speaker thank you so much let's stand glory hallelujah would you thank the musicians those who worked hard to bring us into god's presence this morning [Applause] especially zach with no sleep if you'll turn in your bible this morning do first corinthians chapter 12 i i have a little bit different message for you this morning perhaps it's one that i i might not would normally bring when there are so many visitors among us but it's the bible it's coming right out of the word and we need it we're living in an hour where we need to be able to know what's moving around us we do we really do the enemy is out to seduce us deceive he would like to lie to us and cause us to believe a lie but jesus is the victory first corinthians chapter 12 verse 1. now concerning spiritual gifts brethren i would not have you ignorant paul believed that it was vitally important to instruct the church at corinth concerning spiritual gifts many times in the message of the hour we hear brother branham talking about the need to address the spiritual gifts and how they should operate in the body and he would often say something like this we're getting to that we're going to be talking about that we're going to lay that out because it was part of the restoration all things means all things and if god is going to restore divine healing if and he did he has then he would certainly take us all the way back to to everything that was functioning in the book of acts do you understand that so then if you'll look at first peter before you're seated chapter 4 beginning in verse 10. first peter 4 and verse 10 as every man hath received the gift even so minister the same one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of god i don't know if you know it or not but the greek word charisma that is used for gift comes from the root word chris which is the greek word for grace so when we talk about spiritual gifts we're talking about an extension of god's grace to his church it's powerful to understand that verse 11 if any man speak let him speak as the oracles of god if any man minister let him do it as of the ability which god giveth that god in all things may be glorified through jesus christ to whom be praise and dominion forever and ever amen let me read that verse again if any man speak let him speak as the oracles of god if any man minister let him do it as of the ability which god giveth that god in all things may be glorified through jesus christ to whom be praise and dominion forever and ever amen which means so be it let's pray together father we thank you today for your presence you have not left us here to worship you without the witness of your spirit you have been here this morning and you have confirmed your presence among us and how we thank you for that i thank you for every victory that was on display i do i thank you for every person that moved out of their comfort zone to worship you this morning i i appreciate even those who ran i know that takes a lot some time but i think it is a celebration of victory and i thank you for giving victory to those precious ones who who moved out of their a place of confinement and i know there are those who may not understand but but i just asked lord that you would help us all to find a way to demonstrate our love our gratitude and our thankfulness for who you are and now lord we approach a very important subject for a few moments this morning and it may not be everybody's cup of tea but i ask that you would let there be something in this for every hungry heart i ask that you would give wisdom that you would give understanding that you would give revelation and that you would help us to see that you have placed the gifts of the spirit into your bride church to demonstrate your grace for us and we give honor to you and we remember that we were told that these are love gifts these are the very tokens of the bridegroom's love for his bride and i want to thank you for every bit of that and for every demonstration that you have given to us through the years we ask for your help in the name of the lord jesus christ and the church said amen you may be seated we are going to minister a little teaching this morning on not the gifts of the spirit the charismata but we're going to talk about one particular gift among the nine is that all right we can't do all nine in one service we can't even do justice to the one gift that the lord has laid on my heart to talk about we can't even do justice to that gift in one service but we will scratch the surface together because to me there is one gift that stands out above all the other gifts as a most necessary demonstration of the spirit in the individual life of the believer in the hour that we're living in right now we need them all i i believe let me just go ahead and say i believe that god has placed all nine spiritual gifts in his church anybody with me i need your help then i see in the word where god placed them there and i cannot find a verse where he has taken them out so i have to believe they're here until i doubt very seriously we'll need them in eternity but until perfect love has accomplished all that god will send it to accomplish and the bride goes out of here we know without that demonstration of god's perfect love there will never be a rapture so if you're looking for rapture you've got to believe that god will somehow demonstrate and manifest his perfect love in your life now he did that when he saved you that was perfect love and he did that when he kept you that was perfect love but what he desires to do is to pull us together in an atmosphere of perfect love so that we can love one another even as christ has loved the church and has given his life for the church this is where we struggle [Music] oh i love you i love you i love you i love you i love you we hear it all day long and i'm sure that people mean it often when they say it but to understand what it really means to demonstrate perfect love let me under let me help you to understand it doesn't mean tolerance that's not one of the fruits of the spirit long-suffering is the fruit of the spirit tolerance is not mentioned in there anybody with me so we're living in an hour where we're told that we have to just about tolerate whatever comes along and we have to do it in a gracious manner even if it means compromising god's word there's something that we just can't compromise on in this hour and that is the word of god it's life or death does anybody believe that the word of god is life or death it really is and so we want to understand if if all the nine gifts of the spirit have been given to the local church to the believer first and for and for demonstration in the local church if we were to look at all nine of those gifts and and tried to uh to figure out which one would be the most important of all those nine gifts i don't want to do that they're all by the same spirit paul said they're all given by the same spirit and they all manifest and and they are administered in the body by the same spirit and yet the bible said earnestly seek the best gift so when we look at that we want to understand what that means and and what i have come to understand is it's the gift that is needed in that moment if god's got at least nine gifts of the spirit that are to operate in the spirit-filled church then what gift do we need at the moment and whatever that gift the gift that would be needed the most in that moment that to me this is my understanding that to me would be the best gift for god to use among us in that hour am i confusing you you just didn't expect me to come talk about the gifts this morning did you um ah surprise now in the first reading verse 1 of chapter 12 he said now concerning spiritual gifts brethren i would not have you to be ignorant one translation said to be misinformed and another translation said to be unaware of it must be that paul saw that it was important to define the operation of those gifts so that there be no confusion in the body about how they should operate [Music] so he said i don't want you to be ignorant about this stuff i want you to understand it and i want you to be able to see a little bit about how it should operate in the local church just stay with me because there may be something here you can use in a moment or two i mentioned uh a second ago that the common greek word used for the gifts of the spirit is the word charisma and if you use the plural of the greek word it's charismata and it comes from the the prefix or the root carees in greek which is grace and therefore we can understand that there's a very close relationship between spiritual gifts and the grace of god so if there are any spiritual gifts in operation in your life and there should be i want you to glance up this way every now and again there should be and if there are then that is grace to you now we have come to understand that there are those around the message of the hour that believe that gifts should no longer operate the problem with that is they don't have the authority to take out what god has put in so you go tell them do it your way we're going to try to do it god's way brother branham even tells us and the word tells us that these gifts should operate until there is a bride that is without spot wrinkle or blemish and then that bride is is presented to the bridegroom now you think about a man giving a woman a a a an engagement ring or some kind of token of his love for her and that's how the prophet describes these gifts he said these are god's love gifts to his church he is demonstrating his love and we know by the greek word he's also demonstrating his grace to allow these things to operate in us and if you have the baptism of the holy ghost you already have the potential for those gifts to operate in your life on a personal level now remember there is a difference between the operation of the gifts in the individual life of the believer and the operation of those gifts in the body as a as a community or as a church so we need the gifts of the spirit operating in our individual lives because we are we are quickened by the holy ghost that lives within us and these gifts are sometimes sent to the body to correct and to clean and if those gifts are operating in your life as an individual it may be that god would drop something into your heart that was not there before let's say a word of knowledge and tell you there's something you need to do differently than what you're doing so understand the gifts of the spirit can operate in the life of an individual holy ghost-filled believer and that person may never demonstrate those gifts in a corporate setting in the body of christ gifts and callings are not for private interpretations and it's not for you to try to put something on somebody else but aren't you glad that the holy ghost living inside of you is able to speak to you to give you a word of wisdom to give you a word of knowledge to give you understanding about what you're going through let me ask you a question have you ever had a situation in your life that you are so close to i'll slow down have you ever stood in a forest and couldn't see the forest for all the trees have you ever been in a situation that you could not see the spiritual dimension of that situation because you were so emotionally connected and so mentally close to what was happening around you and once it hits you it's like you've been gobsmacked whoa why didn't i see that before and you didn't see it before because you were so close [Music] that you couldn't really see your hand even though it was right in front of your face and this is why we not only need the exercise of the of the spiritual gifts within us and they are exercise by the way the bible talks about the nature of exercising spiritual gifts even in the life of the believer and that's yielding to what god's trying to say to you have you ever had the this this kind of discernment that god was trying to speak to you but you just couldn't quite hear what it was that he was trying to say and so what do you do you get steel you turn the dumb television off you put your phone down and you say lord i've got to hear from you i don't know if you've ever been that desperate or not but i have i've got to hear from you i know what i think and i know what i see and i know what i hear but i've got to hear from you i've got to know how you see this and what your discernment is and your interpretation of what's going on around us now i read to you just a moment ago and we better move on i read you just a moment ago first peter 4 10-11 can i read it in the amplified bible would you allow me to do that let's look at that in the amplified it says as each of you have received a gift a a particular spiritual talent a gracious divine endowment employ it for one another as as befits good trustees of god's many sided grace his manifold grace to us faithful stewards of the extremely diverse powers and gifts granted to christians by grace unmerited favor are you still there whoever speaks let him do it as one who utters oracles of god when we presume are assumed to speak for god we better know just teaching you a little you help me back we better know when we say the lord showed me the lord told me the lord led me i felt led of the lord when we say that we better know what we're talking about we are to speak when we speak on behalf of the spirit we've got to know that we are speaking by the oracles by the inspiration of god you know brother branham talks about the end time bride and he said she will have thus saith the lord she not he she what's the difference because we know that she represents the body she represents the bride church so it's not just the prophet it's or the bridegroom even but it's the bride she will have thus saith the lord or she will hold her peace this is really what paul is saying if you're going to presume to speak for the lord as though demonstrating a spiritual gift make sure that you know now this is not to put fear in your heart from being obedient to the spirit it's telling you the only way to know is to exercise this just telling what the scripture says you use it use it in your own individual life until you can become confident that what you hear is from the lord and only then maybe this should have been a tuesday night teaching but that's not what he said then and only then should we assume or presume to speak in his name and paul is being pretty specific here whoever speaks let him do it is one who orders are oracles of god utters oracles of god whoever renders him service let him do it as with the strength which god furnishes abundantly so that in all things god may be glorified through jesus christ the messiah could i have just a half a hair in the monitor just a little bit more in the monitor so that i i think it's plenty loud out there but just a little bit in the monitor so i don't feel like i need to continue to strain to him be the glory and dominion forever and ever through endless ages amen which means so be it so paul and now peter speaking to us about the exercising of spiritual gifts both in an individual life my life have you ever needed knowledge that didn't come from information have you ever needed god's knowledge have you ever needed god's wisdom have you ever needed something that was so clear that you could just step out on that and know that it came from god have you ever needed to be able to discern between a spirit whether it's a god spirit or an enemy spirit whether it's the holy ghost or whether it's a false spirit have you ever needed that in your personal life so that you would not be taken under the spell of something that was not of god so i want you to know concerning the spiritual gifts we need them in the body but i also need them in the body i need them in my life as an individual believer so that i can be sharp in the things that are spiritual and it also helps me to discern between that which is spiritual and that which is carnal because we would like to admit it but there's quite a bit of carnality still operating in all of our lives so we want to be able to know am i moving by the spirit or am i moving by the flesh and i don't know about you but i'm capable of doing both on a regular basis well i do know about you too i'm just trying to be transparent you know it doesn't matter how spiritual you get you're still a human and you still have human emotions and you still have human feelings and that's why you need to exercise these things in your spiritual walk with god now because the age isn't getting lighter the age is getting heavier and the spirit of the age is not withdrawing the spirit of the age is invading and we're going to need to walk very circumspectly in this hour and we're going to be able to know and we're not always going to have time to lay before the lord and fast 21 days to know what's god and what's not the bride is going to have to know brother you're going to have to know you don't even have to go after devils are looking for demons to find them somebody said you don't really believe there are literal demons around do you oh yes i didn't have to wait till i got to be an old man to discover that either because when i was just a young boy i would wake up many times in the night until i discovered what was trying to take a hold of my life and and i discovered it and i've told you very transparently through the years that i discovered as a pre-teen that lust was trying to take a hold of my life to destroy the call of god on me anybody ever heard me tell that i've told that multiple times i didn't know where it came from i didn't even know what it fully was i wasn't even 13 years old i wasn't i mean i was pre i would say looking back pre-puberty and things began to torment me and i awakened in the night and i know i know this is sort of a mixed audience here and especially through the stream but it just happened i mean it just really happened i'm not here to convince you it did but i might as well just tell it like it is instead of instead of trying to disguise it brother perry green got onto me one time he said you said that was a vision and he said but you described it as though it were a dream and he said i kind of sensed in my spirit that you did that because you didn't want to trip somebody up about having a vision but he said it's important for god's people to know that visions are still a part of the supernatural christian life and he said for you to make it sound as though it were a dream when it was indeed a vision it's not helping people to see that god is still giving visions to young men and dreams to all men as the scripture said the bible tells us in the book of joel that in the last days god will pour out his spirit upon all flesh and in the book of in the book of acts peter stands up under the inspiration of the holy ghost and he says hey this is that this is the restoration of god's spirit falling on all flesh then we know that as history went forward there was the dark ages and everything that god had added to the church that old devil like a like a locust like a caterpillar like a palmer worm was there eating away you're with me at what god had restored to his church and so there had to be a re-restoration there had to be a final let me let me make that clear a final restoration the bride will never lose what god has placed in her she will never lose that as long as the bride has ministry in the earth everything that god has given to his bride will be operational in your life there will never be a time that you're left here on planet earth without the working of the holy ghost in you and the gifts of the holy spirit manifesting in your life as an individual and corporately as a church so those men who preach that these things are over because that which is perfect has come have totally misunderstood the context of that verse of scripture that appears in a chapter about love it appears in a chapter about love and that chapter about love is sandwiched did i just say sandwiched it is sandwiched my granddaddy never called it a sandwich he said a sandwich it is sandwiched between chapters talking about the gifts now isn't that amazing that the that the apostle would interrupt his teaching on gifts to dedicate a whole chapter to love and then pick up right where he left off continuing to expound about the gifts that's because the gifts that are to be given to the body of christ must be demonstrated by love love must be the motivation of all gifts operating among us because those gifts are an extended demonstration of god's grace to the believer and when they operate in your life as an individual or when you allow that gift to to to speak out of you to to a body of believers as some of you do on occasion you must make sure that you are yielding yourself to love there's one thing we need to know about him god is not the author you finish it he is not the author of confusion and so he didn't send the love gifts to the body to confuse us anybody helping me he sent the love gifts to help us to build us up to help us to stay in the right path anybody with me so according to this passage each spirit-filled believer has at least one gift demonstrating in their life because he talks about when we receive the spirit we receive the giver and if you have received the giver of the gift then i know that there are giftings inside of you they may only be there to lead you as a believer or they may be there because god wants to use you to help the body of christ at large not even just locally but there are gifts of the spirit that are so large because they come from a big god that they transcend the local four walls of the church and they become a gifting to the body of christ at large somebody said how's that possible well he that hath an ear to hear let him hear what the spirit sayeth if you don't have an ear to hear then that's not going to impact you you're going to shed it like a duck sheds water let me also remind you before we move on that the gifts and callings of god are without repentance and it's very possible for someone to operate in a genuine gift even though their life is not lined up with the word i tell you if that if that demonstrates then we got to make sure that we have one of the gifts the one i'm going to talk about this morning i'm not going to talk about tongues this morning or the interpretation of tongues we believe in tongues we don't particularly teach like many of our pentecostal friends do that it's the initial evidence and the reason why we don't teach that is because it gives people an impression that if you speak in tongues you have the holy ghost now that's false i don't mean i don't mean to offend anybody but that's false so that's why you don't hear us saying that speaking in tongues is the initial evidence because we don't want someone to come under the impression that because they they had a uh you know had some syllables and they said some rat tats or some i don't mean to i'm being very serious just trying to be very honest here i hope that didn't offend you i'm not making fun of speaking in tongues i can be like paul said i thank my god i speak in tongues more than you all i've been labeled in our movement as a tongue talker they used to say well if brother shelley could quit talking in tongues long enough he could preach something to us the fact is i wasn't talking in tongues in the pulpit they just didn't like the fact that i ever talked in tongues so i don't want to go to that extreme either i don't want to teach somebody that because you got your tongue a little twisted there and a feel-good feeling on you that you have the holy ghost because having the baptism of the holy ghost is more than speaking in tongues it's the grace to be able to live a life surrendered to every word of god it is also the ability to be able to recognize the message for your day one of the evidences that someone has received the full baptism of the holy ghost is to be able to recognize what god is saying to the church in the day and hour that they live in instead of trying to resurrect something that may not be what god would say to you today it doesn't mean that it's not the truth it means how can we know what god would say if god were standing in our midst and i pray that he is because he lives in the believer since i have seen demonstrations of the demonic that spoke in tongues i've seen women who control their homes talk in tongues i've seen all kinds of demonstrations i i have been in the islands and i have seen false religions somewhat similar to voodoo get caught up in the emotion of some demonstration and begin to speak in an unlearned language now if if i should teach you that initial evidence is speaking in tongues then i would be sitting there and i would be thinking my these these shirtless heathen dancing around this fire rattling in some kind of ecstatic language they must also have the holy ghost and how many of you know that's just not the way it is there's a higher evidence of that however i will tell you that i believe that anyone who experiences the genuine baptism of the holy ghost at some time or another in their life it will be testified to them by the gifting of speaking in tongues you will have that if you desire it and i don't know about you but i desired it and the reason why i desired it is because i saw it and i heard it and i felt it and i said i want that you say well in that being a little bit greedy i want you to know when you see what god is capable of doing in the life of a believer you might get a little greedy too and you might say give me that lord i'd like to have that and he giveth to every man severally according to his will as he desires as he sees fit are you still with me and he does it to profit with all i'm not going to talk about prophecy i'm not going to talk about words of wisdom or knowledge or faith or healing or miracles or i'm going to talk about in a moment one particular gift the gift of discerning of spirits if i were to have to choose and say of all the gifts that we need operating in our life not only in the body at large but if i were to say one of the most let me just say it that way so i don't offend or leave anybody out or anything out but let me just say it this way one of the most important and vital giftings of the spirit in the life of an individual believer is the ability by the spirit to discern is this spirit of the lord or as is it of the flesh or of the enemy how many of you can see the value of having that operating in your life i'm not trying to put something on if you don't want it you don't have to have it but just don't come and tell me what's god and what's not because we can't even make a fair assessment you know what to get let me just say this i think i'm all over the place but that's all right uh let me just explain to you that how god feels about the holy ghost we know the holy ghost is god we don't believe that there's three persons in a godhead we believe there's one and that god manifests himself in three great offices and three very distinct ministries in fact we we get radical sometime and we say plus a whole lot more because he's a healer too and a lawyer and a counselor and a teacher come on now but we understand that in the godhead is the demonstration of father the demonstration of son and the demonstration of holy ghost one of the most powerful revelations that needs to be preached from pulpits across america is that jehovah of the old testament is jesus of the new testament it's pretty simple isn't it and yet the largest portion of the church at large does not believe that jesus is the same as god they will call him god and then theologically explain to you why he's not god how many of you are glad you've got a revelation that when jesus is talking to you that's god's voice that's him speaking to you and when jesus worked on the earth and ministered he was there to minister the works of the father and when he spoke that was the father speaking through him because he said i am my father or what we're one now let me talk just a moment before we before we move into this and i know it's getting late already but that's all right if you do find the need to slip out i know you'll do it quietly and reverently and i know that you would never expect us to to stop early because you have an engagement i know you wouldn't want to do that i know you wouldn't want to do that so if you need to slip out at some point you certainly can but don't miss if you if you can uh hang around then do that because god might be desiring to do something for you the purpose of spiritual gifts at large we're talking about the nine spiritual gifts now in first corinthians 12 but the purpose of those gifts is to edify the body to equip the saints and to glorify god do you want to write that down you that like to take notes some of you been writing the whole time edify the body equip the saints and glorify god and the bible said this is so that the body can profit with all and in first corinthians chapter 12 and verse 11 he said but all these things worketh this is the summary of it but all these things worketh 12 11 that one and the self same spirit dividing to every man severally as he will it's up to him you want to you want to hear the phrase how that reads in the amplified in the amplified it reads who apportions to each person individually exactly as he chooses are you with me as he chooses the gifts of the spirit are up to god and who operates in those gifts is up to god and how they function in our church body and in our lives is up to god because it's the giver we love may we never be like those who love the gifts more than they love the giver we've got to fall in love with the gift the giver of the gift the giver of the gifts is the one that we love now ephesians 4 16 if you'll put that up there just a minute and we're fixed to take off in this from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love do you mind if i break that down a little bit the amplified reads a little bit smoother for because of him the whole body the church in all its various parts closely joined and firmly knit together by the joints and ligaments with which it is supplied when each part with power adapted to its need is working properly in all its functions grows to full maturity building itself up in love anybody got a bad joint this is one time you can confess it anybody got a bad joint anybody believing for a better joint he's a healer he's a healer and we know that he's healed us and many of us have experienced healing in our joints i just recently testified to you about my elbow that swelled up so large and looked hideous and had a big old knot on the end of it and somebody said it was bursitis and somebody said it was gout related and somebody said it was this or that in the other but i think it was when sister heichi passed away i think it was with sister heist he passed away that i first had it and i had to put my arm in a sling because i could hardly move that joint and you may you may not believe this but i tell you what the worst part of it the worst part of it wasn't the pain and it wasn't having to do things with my left hand the worst part of it for me was not being able to use both arms to praise the lord i mean it this one was like that and i could not stand it i kept believing and kept believing and god finally gave me the mobility back in that joint but the pain and the swelling and the fluid was still there but i want you to know i kept praising him for giving me a joint giving me an elbow that worked and i kept telling the lord i want to be able to praise you i want to be able to use that hand to give you glory and honor and praise and it's uncomfortable and i want to be able to turn over in the night using my elbow without pain i need you lord and you know what he did it he did it so i believe god with you he can help you i've seen god do miraculous things i've seen him cause the to get up and walk i've seen god heal broken backs if god can heal a broken back he can take care of a joint that's got a little problem inflammation or pain or something in it amen but you know what about a joint if your joint is not functioning properly especially particular joints of the body it throws the whole body off now you're looking at somebody who's had some pretty pretty serious foot issues through the years two surgeries to correct problems and you know what by by having uh a joint a tendon or some little part of the body not functioning the way it's supposed to you you compensate for that stay with me a moment you over overcompensate for that you limp a little different you turn it a little different to be able to walk without pain and the next thing you know the whole body your whole body gets thrown off and this is really what paul's talking about paul is really telling us that it is vitally important for the body to be able to grow in christian maturity and the only way the body can grow into full maturity building itself up in love is to have every joint functioning joined and firmly knit together by the joints and ligaments which are supplied by the spirit the apostle is confirming that the works of the spirit become the connective tissue that holds the body of christ together are you with me so if you don't have the manifestation of the spirit in your life as an individual or there's a church that doesn't have the gifts of the spirit with freedom to manifest in whatever way the church sets them i'm not against anybody else's order however the church is sovereign and however the church decides to exercise the gifts of the spirit is none of my business i am only responsible for this house and i am deeply concerned that we not shut out the works of the spirit that we allow god to move among us and do what he wants to do for as long as he wants to do it is anybody in agreement with me and here's what i have said concerning the gifts of the spirit if they are to operate on the floor make sure that you are willing to be corrected on the floor now why is that important it's important because brother branham established an order for his tabernacle that was different than that because for so many years there were so many interruptions in the in the service and i read the letter that brother billy paul wrote to my good friend brother cleveland explaining that there was one particular brother that would not settle down and some of the things that brother branham said publicly to address the gifts and how they should operate in the church was because of one brother that wouldn't hear the word of the lord and hold his peace he kept interrupting the flow of even the preaching and how many of you know the bible said that the spirit of the prophet is subject unto the prophet and so there's a time and when the word is going forth that's not the time to start exercising spiritual gifts on the floor are you following me you can find all of this information in first corinthians there's a time and a place i even have watched god create an atmosphere of lull you come to a high moment in praise and then all of a sudden the atmosphere shifts and it's almost like you just come floating gently back down from wherever you've whatever high you've experienced in the spirit do we sound like a bunch of addicts i've never been drunk in the natural i don't even know what it feels like to be drunk in the natural i don't think i've missed anything by the grace of god i've never spent a morning or a night hugging a toilet bowl afraid i was going to lose more than my drink never had to do it never had to have a hangover except a spiritual one a time or two that's the grace of god i'm not bragging to you i'm telling you that he baptized me with the holy ghost and fire when i was seven years old and there was nothing i had nothing else to work off of and so i had no reason to believe that anything that was out there in the world could possibly match what god was doing in my life never high never smoked a joint never popped an upper never smoked a mushroom is that what you do with mushrooms i've eaten a few at olive garden i don't even know the language now my kids laugh at me sometime i don't know how they know so much about it because people talk about things now a whole lot more freely than they used to talk about things stone meant killed [Music] just like i can still remember when gabe been happy come on it's hard to keep up with all the redefinition of things when i was uh you know filling out forms in school and things like that it was very easy there were only two boxes to check male or female very quick i never one time had to question which i was i knew i only had two choices i knew what it wasn't so i surely knew what it was oh we're in another hour now don't you look at me like that you can be silent if you want to be silent but once you get some of this discerning of spirits operating in your life and start yielding to it you will recognize that a lot of what's happening around us now is demonic it's demonic and if a church is so lily-livered and yellow that they can't call it what the bible calls it i don't want to be a part of that system somebody said but you must reach out in love sure we must we must embrace with love we must minister with love but we must not compromise the word of god to do it [Applause] because if we do there is no deliverance for those who are in trouble you will never love somebody to deliverance you may pray them there because you love them you may pray them there because you love them but it takes more than just a hug it takes authority and i want to tell you something that a lot of people don't like it doesn't necessarily take a deliverance preacher either i want you to know there's deliverance in your mouth if you're a holy ghost-filled believer there is deliverance in your mouth and god will honor what you say when you speak his word this is why we want the operation of that going on in our life because we want to know when god says speak we want to speak and when he says shut up we want to discern that it's time to shut up anybody with me gotta hurry gotta hurry not an accident or coincidence that first corinthians chapter 13 appears right in the middle of the apostles instructions concerning the spiritual gifts as we said just a moment now let's look at first corinthians 12 verse 4. all the way through verse 11. can i have a little more good because we're usually here another hour there are diversities of gifts would you read the rest but the same spirit there are differences of ministries would you read the rest and there are diversities of activities works all in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to each one for the prophet of all four to one is given the word of wisdom finish it wait a minute just a moment i must not have king james here i thought i had king james i must not have king james because in this in in my translation it says again through the spirit it says but the manifestation of the spirit is given to each one to profit for all for the one is given the word of wisdom through the spirit to another the word of knowledge through the same spirit so i must have another translation here let's continue to read with yours and i'm sorry for stopping you for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit to another faith to another the gifts of healing to another gifts of uh excuse me to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues now the next verse but all these worketh that one and the self-same spirit dividing to every man severally as he will so if the gift is tongues it's by the holy spirit if it's interpretation of tongues by the holy spirit if it's a gift of miracles by the holy spirit are you with me you understand that all right charity did you put the little chart there did you put the little chart that was in the notes let's look at this carefully now here are here is a little list that you can you can make if you have the time to write it we can't wait on you but if you can write it and if not this will be on the website i don't know if you know this or not but on the app and on the website the notes from the scriptures and the quotes now not always my my extra notes that i make and read but the scriptures and the quotes are there all you have to do is go to the website if you go to thinking through the week i sure wish that i wrote that quote down i sure wished i knew that scripture can't remember exactly where that scripture was found all you have to do is go to the app and it's there for you just click on the notes all you have to do is go to revival.org to the website find the sermon that you're interested in click on it and all the notes are there and you can print it you don't have to ask somebody to bring you if you've got a printer you can print it for yourself and have it and i'm going to tell you something if you'd go back and read those scriptures again during the week and read those quotes again during the week you might find yourself growing in a faster way than just hearing it here on sunday when you get so tired you can hardly hear anyway see it's there for you god's good to us to give us that kind of a technology we're getting ready to launch it hasn't launched just yet to my understanding but we're getting ready to launch a live chat on the app and on the web on the website just like we have on youtube and facebook so when the service is going out someone will be able to type on the app and tell us where they're watching from and give us a prayer request and if i i'm just glancing down here at youtube right now and we have saints greeting us from all over the world from trinidad to to south uh africa and and it goes on and on and on west africa and each one of them will be able to do that in the near future even using the app because our tuesday services are only available on the website and the app that wasn't a commercial that's just letting you know what's going on now this chart here says nine spiritual gifts that's the charismata it's the it's plural for gifts three divisions of gifts number one speaking gifts and the speaking gifts say something and they do it under vocal inspiration and they are gifts of utterance and that is the gift of tongues the gift of interpretation of tongues and the gift of prophecy we refer to those three gifts as speaking gifts and it's easy for you to see why is that right all right now the next three the next three are called healing hearing hearing gifts because they reveal something and they are referred to as gifts of revelation and they are number one discerning or distinguishing spirits number two word of knowledge number three words of wisdom all three of these gifts operate by the spirit of the lord telling you something making something real to you clearly revealing the mind of god in a particular situation a spiritual knowledge that you didn't know how i'll give you an example in a moment something you didn't know about you you didn't have any earthly knowledge of it and the spirit of the lord just drops that right down into your heart i want you to know that's not just for preachers [Music] let me just use this in a very carnal way here brother steve i want i'm going to pick on you a minute is that all right did you say great oh go ahead all right i thought to myself i've never had anybody so anxious to be picked on great he said but but i think he won't mind this now he's a he is a a floor layer he's a carpet layer and a and do you do tile or just you do tile to he's a flooring man and uh i know that he has probably got into situations now first of all he prays over every job that's his testimony praise over every job and he has told me and and i know because he came in one day when we were having some work done in our home and got right down in the middle of the concrete floor put one hand in the air and called on the lord to come and help us to get that job done i tell you that's faith that's what i believe in if i know anything about him i pray i know he's probably really smart at what he does but there have probably been times along the way that he ran into a situation with flooring that he wasn't exactly sure immediately how to handle so he's sitting there scratching his head and trying he's already prayed and asked the lord to help him so he need not be shocked he need not be surprised when the spirit of the lord drops something down a thought comes into his head and says you know if you do it that way and turn it that way just a little bit mark that right there and come right back in from this angle the problem would be solved i could go all the way around this room i'm sure there's been a gutter job that even all the years of experience of hanging rain gutters they're they're just the mind just sometimes goes blank and you're trying to figure out what to do next and all of a sudden you may not even know that it's divine but if you've asked the lord for help don't be so shocked i've had women tell me i ruined the recipe i bet sisters tell me i ruined the recipe and i knew my husband was gonna be crazy oh yeah they tell about you they talk about you sometime and i wanted to fix it there was too much invested in the ingredient and i wanted to fix it and all of a sudden i just said lord help me and the idea came how i might try to take it in a different direction all right look at me now at least you're listening i got the lady's attentions see you had no business throwing it all out my little old mama when she would mess up a layer on a layer cake she would get so aggravated with herself that she'd put her whole hand down through the layer it would aggravate her so bad she'd just put her whole hand down through the layer and pick it up by the wax paper and toss it and guess what us kids would be doing chasing her to the garbage can we don't care what it looks like we don't even need frosting just give it to us i know that whatever situation you're in and you ask the lord to help you i know that some of you have had an inspiration drop in and you all of a sudden had knowledge on what to do about a particular situation i know parents that have prayed god help me with my kids i don't know what to do with them next i don't know what to say to them i don't even know how to talk to them help me lord and all of a sudden a thought dropped down in your mind and if you approach it this way they'll listen to you i know you'd like to think that you're just so smart that you think thunk of all those things on your own but i want you to know that may have very well been an operation of the holy spirit in your life bringing knowledge to you that you did not previously have and helping you get out from under a load or out of a messy situation and somebody said what are we to learn from that ask the lord if he has filled you with the holy ghost don't be ashamed to ask him to help you listen my little baptist granny believed that you shouldn't trouble the lord she believed that you shouldn't ask god about little things he was too busy keeping the stars in in orbit and and the planets there and she believed most of her life that god did not want to be bothered he's not the only one we know people like that all around us she believed that god didn't want to be bothered but her problem one day i took her and sat her down and i opened up my bible and i began to read to her scripture after scripture after scripture and i showed her writing god's word where he said cast your cares on me because i care for you mama do you know what that means she said what does it mean i said if you care about it god cares about it whatever you're concerned about he's concerned about whatever you care about god cares about and you don't have to be ashamed to kneel down let's kneel right down here and tell the lord whatever it is that's on your heart and i want you to know my grandmother went from being a sunday christian my mama's mama went from being a sunday christian to being a prayer warrior because she discovered that god cared about her needs and what she was worried about and what she was concerned about and i want you to know she would get on my nerves because i would be busy doing something she said did you pray about it and i'd say well granny i prayed you don't want to woke up she said we've got to pray about it now she said you're the one that messed this up you're the one that taught me this she said we're not going to go any further until we stop and ask the lord for his help we taught our children when they were learning their schoolwork that god cares about that and when you get to a situation that you can't grasp he wants to help you with that if you ask him do you ever get the idea that we as christians are living below our privileges because we don't understand that the spirit of christ has come to live within us by the power of the holy ghost to help us in so many different areas of our life are you still there and a wisdom have you ever been in the presence of someone and and all of a sudden they give an answer of wisdom and you wonder where in the world they get that wow that person i i've seen them when they didn't seem like they had enough sense to get out of the rain and now they're speaking as with the oracles of god speaking wisdom into a situation that solves every facet of the problem where did that wisdom come from i want you to know i've seen young men i've seen young women i've seen children speak with wisdoms that i knew were way beyond their potential inability at that moment and recognize that god was imparting through the gift of the spirit a wisdom in their life that they had not yet reached a maturity to be able to even grasp that is the goodness so are you sure you don't want the holy spirit gifts working in your life are you sure you want to put them out and say they're not for today how about we just let god keep working in us the way he desires to work in us are you with me and then the last three and we'll move on the last three are the doing gifts they do something they're gifts of power to every man is given a measure of faith every man is given a measure of faith but i want you to know there's a gift of faith there's a super sense of faith that god can drop down in your heart when you least expect it and a faith come out of you that you didn't even know you carried in here with you just a faith that said i know that i know that i know that i know that i know i know that god is going to move on our behalf and underneath those doing gifts there are also gifts of power gifts of healing and gifts of miracles these are the power gifts we talked about the revelation gifts and we talked about the utterance gifts now i want to read you something from we would see jesus are you up for that i need a few more minutes paragraph 77 now if you believers you said how many believers in here if i could not do it if then he said i could not do it i cannot bring him it takes all of us together to do it he said i'm just a part of him and you're a part of him but if you're sick and needy i'm your brother god set in the church now there's nine spiritual gifts goes in each local body we call that the local church or the local assembly where you're sitting this morning and the prophet is clear that in every local church in every local body in every local assembly the nine gifts are to be given god is not a giver who gives and takes back he's a giver who gives and keeps on giving this is his character the way some people try to understand theology they try to take god out of his own character it is not his character to give something to you and then you get used to having it and he took it back in fact god's character doesn't diminish his character increases is anybody following what i'm saying i'm so thankful that you are now in these nine spiritual gifts given to each local body here's a listing of them he doesn't name them all i don't think he may but i don't think he does here he said which is tongues interpretation of tongues and prophecies and so forth i just read all nine of them to you he didn't read them all nine here but he read tongues interpretation of tongues prophecies and so forth he mentions the three utterance gifts but there is five predestinated offices of the church nine spiritual gifts to the church and five predestinated offices of the church and those offices are apostles prophets teachers pastors and evangelists and brother branham says that's what god set in the church now in this quote he indicates that the five ministerial offices or the ascension gifts that they're called sometime are given to the church and he says that the nine spiritual gifts are given to the local body there's a little difference there but he doesn't always say it that way but i just wanted to point that out as we move on he said the holy spirit that's the office the holy spirit might fall on one tonight and speak in tongues and the other give prophecy and so forth and the next night it might be on somebody else and somebody else like that he said that's local gifts in the body to now if we don't allow the gifts to be in the body guess what happens we get crooked don't you sit back there and think that i'm teaching you that only the pulpit has the gifts this has never been that kind of a church i came here in 1990 and from 1990 until this day the gifts of the spirit have been welcomed to operate not only from the platform or as granny used to call the rostrum not only from the platform but in the local body of believers in the pew in the church now there's an order to how those gifts operate in here but we want them and we welcome them we understand that the gifts don't interrupt the gifts there's a right time there's a right order there's a right atmosphere is anybody in agreement we understand that now he goes on here said that that's local gifts in the body to keep us straight but in the church alone five offices apostles and here brother branham says means missionaries in other places he said it means sent ones which is what missionaries do he never distinguishes that it's foreign missionaries only but he mentions that it is one who is sent with a message have you ever been sent with a message prophets teachers pastors and evangelists god sets those in the church he said now let's believe with all our heart that through these ministering gifts that the great god of heaven will send christ among us tonight that we'll see jesus he said let us now pray and bow our heads i want to give you one more as i thought on my way is the name of this sermon it's from chicago ohio and i'm reading it because i want everyone who watches this to understand that these gifts are given to the local body and then i'm going to take the last few minutes that i have and speak specifically about one of those gifts in paragraph 63 he said sometimes now god he's god oral robert says he's a good god and that's true he's a good god and yet he's more than a good god he's a god of wrath too now that's a god that the american church don't want to talk about they don't talk about the fact there's a penalty for sin and there's consequences for our choices but how many of you know the truth of the word is there are consequences for our choices good bad or ugly they're there he said he's more than a good god he's a god of wrath too don't you think he's too good now don't you think he excuse me don't you think he's too good now that he won't he won't keep his word and he will excuse you so don't you get this idea that god will turn away from his word because he likes you he's going to hold on to his word he never does that his holiness requires him to be just i want you to say he's a just god he is a just god he's a just god besides a good god he's good but he also requires justice and his law requires him to be just he must keep it so then he's a god of wrath also so there's the balance and said now remember when if you wouldn't take my word for it or i wouldn't take your word that would settle it but but not god god sends gifts into the church to steal to be sure that everyone will be without an excuse now one of the main things that we have understood from the message is judgment cannot fall unless a warning goes forth first know what i'd like for you folks to do and i know it's get maybe a little personal say this i would like for you to take a tour on the website i would like for you to go back to the media page for just a moment and i would like for you to go back and just look at titles some of you have a good enough memory that if you saw the title of a sermon you'd begin to remember parts of that message i want you to go back and i want you to look at how god has been so gracious and so good to instruct us even over the last two to three years to help prepare us for what he wants to do among us i don't know how many times he has come to say you ought to deal with this this ought to be dealt with you ought to take this to the lord you ought to put this up before for me you you ought to let me you ought to let me deal with this i don't know how many times god has said i don't know how many times a cry has gone forth from this pulpit come get help i've tried multiple things i've realized that there are people among us who don't have confidence full confidence in me i understand that it happens and so i've tried on several occasions to offer brother greeley as an alternative to come down here and minister to anybody in here that's got an ought against me if there's anybody oh you're getting personal no no i'm just really telling you how it works i want people to be helped if i can help you if you've got so many things against me if you do and people do sometime if you do then i wanted you to know there's somebody else i also want you to know that in this body there are people sitting right here among you who have gifts to pray for you and you hear me sometimes say lay your hand over if you're if you don't mind now i know there are people that don't want to be touched i just tell you i don't think i'd be settled in a pentecostal church if i didn't want to get close i don't like standing up and sitting down in church well then i think i'd find me a liturgical church somewhere because if you come to a pentecostal church it's going to be up and down up and down up now let's all stand let's all see it let's all stand let's all see it and you come around here and people stand when they're not even told to stand they just stand they just get caught up in the inspiration of things so i recognize that everybody likes things different and i understand that even a man of god even men of god have personalities we do we don't lose our personality because we're called in fact god calls us because of who we are you do understand that don't you and if we all were just alike what a boring five-fold ministry that would be if we all ministered in just the same way that's why no preacher should try to imitate another preacher in his delivery everybody ought to just be exactly what god has called them to be and function in that ministry because there's going to be somebody out there that needs that so when i recognize through the years that there were people sitting in the church who had an ought against me and who had limited my ability to be able to minister to them or their children then i have stood in this pulpit and said brother greeley will come and he will minute i want you to come if you have a need i've said to people in the in the sanctuary if god should lay on your heart to go and minister to somebody i want you to feel freedom to do that as long as you know it's the lord why do i say that because i don't want you to get punched in the mouth you need to know when you're going to somebody that they've got a heart to receive you in some way you know what i'm saying especially if it's somebody you don't know if it's somebody you know you might punch them back if it's somebody you don't know i would rather you not do that what i mean by that is we all have a burden for one another at times we see someone is struggling and i have watched people in this church go and try to minister to needs and watch people stiffen up like like zombies like like two befores because sometimes people so overthink every situation that they think there's some dark motive at work and they're not coming to pray for me because they want to help me they're coming to embarrass me or they're coming because they think i've got a devil or they're coming because they think i'm in sin let me tell you something i think there comes a time we ought to shut off our thinker and just enter into the presence of the lord because we may think ourselves right out of a touch from god i just want to say to this church this morning and this is not an election or a vote of confidence but i just want to say to this church this morning that you and i know for sure that every person has had opportunity after opportunity after opportunity after opportunity to receive help if not from the pastor then the associate pastor and if not from the associate pastor from the body of believers there's one thing that is required to be able to get help and that is you've got to know you need it and if somebody is so stubborn that they don't seem to recognize their need it doesn't matter who goes to them it doesn't matter who's praying for them it doesn't matter how many greeting cards you give them until somebody is willing to receive help that's why we try different ways of getting people to get help i don't think you have to come up here i think god will meet you right where you are he met us a little while ago listen we had something unusual this morning we had a special song given from the pew and the spirit of god just ministered all over this room and i was uh conchita i'm getting uh comments here from around the world oh what a song what a voice what an anointing how that touched my life and that was a little different than ordinary i like a god of variety i like when god goes beyond above and beyond to touch our lives and to reach out for us i guess what i'm trying to say is we have no excuse to sit service after service after service after service and not receive any kind of help at all when help is available to us oh yes well how do you know i'm not getting it home well i want you to know that if you're getting that kind of help at home in your quiet time i love that that's relationship we need that but don't forget that when you come to god's house bring your help with you if you can be jovial and you can be easy to get along with and you can be a fun outside church then don't come here and act like some sober judge come here and allow the holy spirit to touch you because if you indeed are god's child not only does he want to help you he may want to bring you to a place that you can help somebody else when i was sitting here on this platform today the lord quickened the scripture in my heart i had to get my phone out real quick to find it but it was a rebuke that jesus gave to the religious elders and order the religious elite of his day and he said i've got a problem with you because you won't go in you won't go into what god's trying to do and you stand in the way you stand in the door and you won't let other people go in can i tell you church this morning that that truly we have influence every one of us have influence in our life over somebody and when you won't run for god's best when you won't reach out to have god's best in your life not only do you miss but somebody who's looking to you for a little bit of help and stability is missing also if you can't run on for god for yourself look around oh i don't mean to get so wild now but look around at your own children look around at your own teenagers if you don't want to get help for yourself run to god on their behalf so that they can get help don't be like the pharisees of the days of jesus who stood in the door refusing to go in and lead others into what god had prepared for them in that day which was the reality of who jesus was god was now on the scene working among them are you still here we're nearly done god sends gifts into the church to steal to be sure that everyone will be without an excuse some of these gifts are oh well there's nine spiritual gifts that goes into every local body i could read you hundreds of paragraphs where he says every local body he said how many believes that first corinthians 12 that's speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues and gifts of prophecy and discernments and all the different wisdom and knowledge and gifts of healing and all that goes into what in the local body so don't try to tell me that the nine spiritual gifts are just for the for the body of christ at large and they may not be operational in every local assembly they ought to be because if you've got one holy ghost filled believer in a church you've got the potential for all nine gifts of the spirit to function if there was only one that he could flow through we're not talking about offices but the brand is very clear that the gift of prophecy and the office of a prophet are two totally different gifts altogether one is an office for the church and one is a gift to the local body in fact he's teaching us that one may prophesy and never prophesy again because he was not called as a prophet he was called to be used only with a gift of prophecy these things are not confusing if we take a little time to read the word right it's their force i'm hurrying and then there's five ministerial offices how many believes that sure and that's apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists and how many knows that he's asking us several times do you know that and i do know that how many of you know that all right he goes on now how can you say there's a pastor or evangelist without saying there's a prophet now you may think that brother vandam is talking about word prophets here but he's talking about five fold prophets may i just be clear and tell you that brother branham was not a prophet after the fivefold ministry but agabus was brother branham was not functioning in the five-fold office of a prophet he was functioning under under the under a word prophesied ministry which places an authority there that doesn't mean that we worship should worship a man or or or just stand in awe of the gift or the office that a man carries but we must recognize that this was a gift that was prophesied to forerun the second coming of jesus christ and he has been faithful to do that whether you can see it or not it doesn't change god's economy from being fulfilled right before my eyes and that's what i'm going to fellowship around the last day i live on planet earth you will find me somewhere around that message around that word because it's life-changing for those who will open up their hearts and let it i wouldn't turn myself back now into a denominational system you don't have enough money in your 401 to turn my life back to that system i'm just being honest i don't want that anymore i've seen the politics of churchianity i'm not interested in church entity politics anymore i want to gather around the word anybody with me where are we at now uh uh how can you say there's a prophet when there's not when there isn't an apostle see some people like to say oh there's pastors evangelists and teachers that's only threefold but they don't want to say prophets they don't want to talk about apostles he said the same god said teachers and evangelists said prophets he keeps his word we don't pin knife it we don't cut out what we don't like it just preach it that's what god's up it's up to god to take care of his own word don't you believe that that's a question i'm moving on he said now a prophet in the gift of prophecy is two different things how many knows that a gift of prophecy works through the church a prophet is born to prophet jeremiah now he goes back to a word order here he's describing it more as a word order jeremiah was born to prophet even before he ever formed in his mother's womb god made him a prophet and ordained him a prophet over the nations this is what the bible said so it's indisputable you believe it's indisputable so john 712 years before he was born isaiah saw him the voice of one crying in the wilderness jesus christ was a woman's seed from the garden of eden he couldn't be nothing else but jesus christ the son of god moses was born to prophecy prophets are not made it isn't laying on of hands and giving gifts it's something that god gave god have set in the church first apostles then prophets others are local gifts that goes into the church now the lord is with us we believe and we will do those and will do these things for us i'm trying to be uh reading too quickly now now in the few minutes that i have left and i know i must stop i want to speak for just a moment about one little aspect of the gift of discerning of spirits would you like to know what that is if you don't know would you like to know that's a good question and i want to know let me tell you what it's not the gift of discerning of spirits is not the gift of suspicion no such gift nine spiritual gifts all put up there on the board for you and none of them the gift of suspicion spiritually minded people can get a little off track sometime i believe in cleaning your house i do i believe there's things in our homes that ought not to be there and i think that some of us would have a lot more victory in christ if we'd get some of that stuff out of our house anybody with me oh it's getting quiet i'm counting on you you can't leave me now we we would do so much better if some of us would would make up our mind listen the world is crazy after witchcraft now some of these games some of these video games that you all play there's a lot of witchcraft in that i don't want that i deal with enough spirits in my life that i don't want to put myself down in front of that kind of stuff and let it become a part of who i am it gets in your spiritual dna if you're not careful you open the door and the enemy doesn't wait to be invited if you open the door he just comes right through so i will tell you that there are people right here in this assembly that would have a whole lot more victory in your life if you didn't have a television just get rid of the thing it keeps tormenting your life you keep going back to the things that you've already made up your mind you don't want to put before your eyes you keep going back to them because it's convenient and easy to do so i wonder if anybody will help me preach some of you would be a whole lot better off and have a whole lot more victory in your life if you'd get rid of them old game boxes just watch how quiet it gets why now i understand that they're talking they talk to each other on them well that opens you up to a whole different world out there as we well know people meet folks out there like that just like a dating site i know you're ready to go i'm kind of ready to go too now i'm going to stick around another minute or two and if you do have to slip out nobody's going to talk about you and accuse you of being guilty of all them things i recently was in a room where somebody was in that room where i was it got really caught up in that gaming stuff a girl a woman a wife a mother she got caught up in that stuff i don't know if it was on headsets like people communicate with now i didn't even know that kind of stuff existed i think i'm a little bit tech savvy yes i admit it takes me a long time to add a contact it's complicated some of the amish said brother shelly i sure would like to get that friday text and the former amish that were here last weekend sure would like to get that friday text i said i'll be glad to send it to you let me get your contact information and you know what it would have been quicker just to hand them the phone just give it to brother truman or give it to brother some of them just let them add the contact because i'm sitting there i'm slow at this i'm sorry i'm slow at this i didn't even know they were talking to one another on walkie-talkies and headsets and can communicate like that i know there's apps on the phone where you can send messages to people and after a short amount of time they disappear i'd like to know where the accountability is in that i know there's things like that that you can send pictures to one another and after a little while they disappear i'd like to know where the accountability in that is i'd like for some of you parents to answer me that question you really want your children sending pictures and teenagers to one another like that and they disappear and nobody has any access to know what's going on you say well you just don't hardly trust anybody i'll tell you what i don't trust i don't trust the devil that's out to destroy he's out to kill and destroy he's out to tear up marriages he's aft after our children he'd like to take our teenagers and throw them right out into the midst of witchcraft way over their heads i can't believe you're talking like that with visitors here they need to hear it too everybody ought to hear it every now and again because they call it innocent the crazy church world called harry potter innocent it's just good literature this well-written literature they say not understanding that it opened up a world of imagination to to a host of a whole multitude of kids that had never even understood that that kind of stuff existed and even though it may be presented in the in the uh in the framework of fantasy i've had enough experience in the realm of witchcraft to know that it's very much real and i don't know if you've ever met anybody that's seen levitation or things like that but if you've met me you've met people like that i stood in my hotel room in india just a few years back i stood in my hotel room and looked out the window and watched a man not just one man but several men by the power of witchcraft and false religion levitate themselves off the ground and hover in the air without any tricks involved and those precious hindu people and and and sikhs and all these different religions that are represented they're throwing money in the street because they're afraid if they don't these men are going to curse them so don't tell me that these kind of things aren't real and don't tell me that the enemy is not looking for all kinds of ways no wonder i said a moment ago we need to be able to discern spirits so i knew this young lady who was i think maybe just typing chats i don't know if it was by voice or not just typing chats and the next thing you know a mother with several children and a husband had struck up an emotional affair with a man from another country all because of that private gaming and when exposed had to say to her husband i'm going to go and check him out i have to give this an opportunity a chance i have to give this a chance to see if this is something good for me it may be that i will leave and never come back and bought a plane ticket how would you like to be the husband left with the kids to know that your wife is leaving you to go off and check out another man in a foreign country to see if he might be something that she could count on i don't know what the man was left at home with her kids seems to me like he might be something you could count on and she goes and wasn't there but just a few hours and fear struck her heart and she realized with a reality that shook her to the very core you can be anything you want to be in the virtual world you can look like any picture you choose to look like you can portray yourself to be anything you want to portray yourself to be in a virtual world you know that's where this is all going you understand that that's what technology is doing is taking us in that kind of a direction where people will spend more time in a virtual reality than they do in the reality that we walk around in i'm not losing my mind i'm telling you that's what facebook has already announced they'd like to do and moving in that direction and then a fear struck that girl's heart and she was afraid that she might lose her life she made her way back to the airport and had to go through all the rigamarole i don't even remember if she was there one night she had to go through all the rigamarole of getting her ticket changed and getting herself back and how would you like to walk into a house where you've left your children with your husband and say i was wrong am i welcome to come home and every bit of that was because a door was opened and somebody wasn't discerning that this is a spirit that is not out to give you a better life this is a spirit that is out to kill you this is a spirit that's out to destroy your marriage this is a spirit that wants to steal your children right out from under your house is anybody with me i want to i want to say this and close as soon as i can we must have the gift of discerning of spirits i think we ought to pray as we get ready to leave here we everyone ought to pray lord if you have filled me with the holy ghost if i have the genuine holy ghost in my life i'm asking you to give me the grace and ability to discern any time i come in contact with a spirit that is not of christ i want you to know it's very very rare for the person that's being anointed by a false spirit to recognize that they're being used by a spirit until confronted by the word and if you confront that spirit by the word and the person that's underneath the influence of that spirit can then not recognize and realize when the word confronts the spirit and that person cannot realize that they're under the influence of a spirit that person is not just under the influence of a spirit they're deceived the bible said no you're not try you've got to try every spirit know you're not that these seducing spirits are going to come out into the world and they'll lie to people and people will believe the lie it's a very serious thing sometimes a spirit is really just carnality building up in our lives it has to be dealt with by the word and by the spirit the ability to discern between my flesh what my flesh is telling me and what the spirit is telling me but there are times that spirits are trying to work in your family they're out for destruction somebody said well you're just trying to make us fearful not at all i'm trying to tell you that god has given you power over all the powers of the enemy but it's very very dangerous not to be able to discern did you know the bible talks about blasphemy of the holy ghost and and the truest definition of blasphemy it's the only unpardonable sin the truest definition of blasphemy that we can find is not making fun of the holy ghost people say that's making fun of the holy ghost it's more than that the truest definition of blasphemy is attributing the works of god to the devil identifying what god is doing as the devil and it can be quite confusing in reverse to try to give god credit for what the enemy is doing it's a very very dangerous thing so i like to tell people all the time if somebody worships a little differently than you be careful what you say be careful how you call something of the devil if someone dresses a little different than you or acts a little different than you be careful what kind of label you put on it because truly as musicians are coming truly in this hour we need to ask the lord for the discerning of spirits to be able to recognize when something is a spirit and when something is not we are not to be suspicious we are to be led by the spirit how many of you have the holy ghost i'm not looking but i want you to identify yourself if you have the baptism of the holy ghost you have every right to ask the lord this morning lord i want you to help me exercise the gift of discerning of spirits in my life i want to recognize what is me and what is the influence of a spirit that is not me but it's something trying to trouble my life let me ask you a question in closing is there anybody in this room that has experienced this kind of thing before and you have recognized in your life [Music] that you had fallen under the influence of a spirit that was not christ something was trying to operate your life anybody wanna as that young boy i'm going to close with the finishing of my testimony you can play softly if you feel to as that young boy pre-adolescent begin to experience thoughts and feelings and emotions that i'd never experienced before i received the baptism of the holy ghost at seven years old and i walked in the victory total victory in my life for several years as a child you say i don't believe a child like that could receive the holy ghost at 7 and really understand what it is like to live the life of an overcomer i did and god used me in those days to preach and and and souls were saved and lives were changed and and the ministry was launched in just a few years from now we'll celebrate 50 years of ministry active ministry in the kingdom of god i've made many failures and many mistakes and many messes in 50 years but i've had a lot of victories too and as i lay there as a as a young boy barely a teen i don't think i was i don't think i was yet a teenager all these things demon spirits would manifest in my room and and stand around the edges of my bed and you can say it wasn't literal or wasn't real but they would they would literally shake the mattress and i had already received the baptism of the holy ghost and so these things began to trouble me and torment me that way and i would raise up in the bed and rebuke them in the name of jesus christ i command you to leave my room and they would flee and i might go days and never have that again and finally as those thoughts would come and all these different things would come and i had nobody to talk to and nobody to ask about them i would spend most of the night still in school but i would spend most of the night at the foot of my bed on my face begging god for deliverance and not fully understanding what i needed to be delivered from and one night the spirit of god walked me through my my past my parents and grandparents he walked me through it and he showed me the spirit of lust that was on my father that destroyed his marriage he showed me the spirit of lust that was on his father that almost destroyed his marriage i later found the letter that my mother wrote her father-in-law i didn't know this happened but i later found the letter years later in fact last year or year before i found it read it again but i read it years ago a letter that my mother wrote to her father-in-law who had left my grandmother and was living with a woman in the valley and she said mr ralph i don't care what you're doing and i love you just the same but you are going to miss the most important thing in your life the birth of your first grandchild if you don't come home and she said i plead with you to leave that woman in the valley and come home to your family and he did i remember i have memories of a boy being let loaded up in the back seat of an automobile and my mother driving all over columbus looking for my dad and i was they were divorced when i was five so it had to happen before i was five and she would find him somewhere with another woman but as god was leading me that night he took me from my dad to my grandad to my great-grandad and showed me the spirit that had tormented mr harvey my great-grandfather that it cost him his happiness in life and it cost him to be unfaithful to his wife i wasn't even a teenager i certainly wasn't sexually active in any way but the tormenting spirits of hell had already come to claim me i don't know how many generations it went back i god didn't walk me through any more than that i don't know how many it might have gone 100 generations i have no way of knowing how far that spirit went back but all i know is laying at the foot of my bed night after night after night on my face begging god to deliver me from what i didn't even understand he met me there he saw my limited knowledge and limited understanding he knew i didn't know how to discern what was going on and he spoke to my heart and he said i'm going to deliver you of a spirit of lust that has visited your family for generations now as a 11 12 year old boy at the foot of my bed i had no concept of children of my own i had no thoughts of having grandchildren of my own all i knew was that god had come to expose and to deliver and he gave me the grace to discern the spirit that was out to destroy my life although it had never identified itself because i had not even really reached that stage in life to be thinking of those things even though my mother was not a christian she raised me as close as she possibly could in a pure environment i had never seen a a picture of pornography or i had never come in contact not even as a kid with with little neighborhood friends or things like that that you know happened so readily around around life none of those things had happened so i fully did not understand what the enemy was trying to do but he came because he wanted to destroy my life and he wanted that spirit to continue to not only torment me and my generation but he already had picked out that that thing would touch my children and their children anybody with me it's vitally important that we have the gift operating in our individual lives to be able to discern spirits that come to torment us and you talk about making somebody mad touch their children get the concept that the enemy would have liked to have put that thing on my children and their children it'll make you swinging mad it'll cause you to beg god don't ever let me have a day that i don't have the ability to discern the kind of spirits that are operating now i'm not an expert i'm not an expert in these things and i'm not boasting but i don't know anybody else in this room that's had more experience with it than i have you're saying that i can give you hundreds and thousands of examples if i had the memory to go back through the years of praying and casting out demon spirits you've heard some of the testimonies so for me to go to someone and identify that a spirit is operating in their life and for them to look at me and tell me that there is no spirit operating in their life at all that this is just a personality conflict is about the dumbest thing i've ever heard of you can say amen on me or look at me like i'm crazy so should i ever come to you and tell you there's something going on that you need to find out what it is and get it all right with god i advise you humbly maybe you don't think this sounds very humble i'm talking to my own church people i'm not talking to you visitors if i come to you that way you ought to know that i have taken some time to consider the seriousness of my words if you're not able to discern you ask the lord and he will open your eyes if you're able to recognize how a spirit is trying to cause confusion in your family or in your church or around you and you are able to recognize that god is letting you see that because he wants you to pray and he wants you to take a stand for what is right the one thing i know about spirits is they're contagious they're transferable what brother andrews preached to us so many years ago now i'm not saying anymore and i didn't say this to strike fear in you i want you to know you got power over anything the enemy would throw in your life but there are people that stand there are people in this room right now that if god would open your eyes and let you recognize what the enemy is trying to do you could come to calvary you could come to calvary and the authority of the blood i believe that we're in an hour now where many times somebody's deliverance is not in the hands of the preacher it's in their own hands i want you to know you're not an underling in the kingdom of god you're not some little peon in god's economy if he loved you enough to call you and to save you and to fill you with his spirit he's already loved you enough to give you an authority to deal with whatever it is the enemy would use to bind you down to confuse you god is not the author of confusion i want to see people free and i'm not dumb enough to think that they've got to have me to be free you don't have to have me to be free i can be god's gift to you if you let me be brother greeley can be god's gift to you if you'll let him be but i want you to know you can have deliverance in your own mouth somebody could sit right back there today and speak their own freedom oh i don't think we've got time to attach ourselves to a man not in this hour we've got to attach ourselves to jesus christ and know that he can deliver whatever it is the enemy uses to tie you up and he's raising up a warlock spirit in people's hearts you start watching the enemy touch your family and i want you to know you'll get that we talked yesterday at the funeral about sister anita operating in a mama bear anointing she's not the only one that has to have a mama bear anointing sometime when you recognize that the enemy's trying to touch something that belongs to you and you start taking thank you jesus you start taking authority over that my god i feel something so generational happening right now in in my spirit i just believe that the lord wants to free somebody here today and you go out of here lighter than you came in let's worship the only way i know to create an atmosphere of deliverance is to worship if you have to slip out and you're free of these things god bless you as you leave us but if you're like me and you need some help in these areas why don't you worship with us let's see what the lord will do it doesn't have to be long and drawn out he might meet you in the first song he might meet you in your first effort to concentrate on him i'll do some more teaching on discerning of spirits tuesday night for those of you that will be here we'll probably finally get to the subject i want the lord to help us now let's worship him come on hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah i know it's late the weapon may be for but it won't prosper come on out here when the darkness falls it won't prevail cause the god i serve knows only how to triumph [Music] and my god will never fail oh my god we'll never [Music] for the battle belongs to lord i'm gonna seek a victory i'm gonna seek a victory for the battle belongs to you lord the weapon may be formed but it will prosper and when the darkness falls it won't breathe cause the goddesser knows only how to triumph and my god will never fail my god we'll never fail i'm gonna seek a victory i'm gonna see a victory [Music] alcoholism [Music] it's time [Music] you don't have to confess it to me you tell me somebody may speak victory [Music] [Music] these are your children [Music] there's power in the mighty name of jesus sharpen our discernment and everywhere he wages him [Music] i'm gonna see a victory yes i know how this story is [Music] victory [Music] [Music] [Music] yes you turned [Music] i'm not gonna give you a hiding place [Music] [Music] every spirit of infirmity in the name of jesus [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] i'm gonna seek a victory [Music] the weapon may be formed but it won't prosper when the darkness falls it won't prevent because the god i serve knows only how to triumph and my god [Music] i'm gonna see a victory for the battle belongs to you lord yes i'm gonna seek a victory i'm gonna see a victory [Music] [Music] the lord is calling someone this morning the lord is calling to you to take a stand [Music] i believe if you will humble yourself before the lord and i know you you've come to worship [Music] god will give you strength to stand you found yourself being a little too wishy-washy not trying to say that to be offensive i found those seasons in my life where you just don't want to rock the boat but you get a little too compromised you start swallowing things that you are not supposed to swallow tolerate things that you're not supposed to tolerate in other people's lives and then in your own life and you want the lord i know i know that if you recognize that you're like me you want the lord to give you strength to stand [Music] i've been talking to some folks recently who've been telling me god is dealing with me about what to get rid of and what to throw out of my house and what's been stealing my time and i started to say earlier everything doesn't have a spirit every rock don't have a demon under it you cannot become paranoid in this hour but if god highlights something if the holy ghost brings discernment to you about something you've got to obey him you can't play with god you can play with the preacher's opinion but you can't play with god and i just feel like the lord is calling to someone today he wants to give you strength to stand for him and he wants to strengthen your feet your give your hind's feet to stand on the word and watch what happens when you do so we just pray right now if you're here and you'd say i need some of that just hold up your hand i need some of that strength now lord i'm standing here with a group of people who need you and we confess today that we need your strength to stand in this evil hour your word told us that this day was coming and this generation would come and the end time would be upon us your word told us what it would look like before the coming of the lord and we're in that season where we see the scripture fulfilling and lord we need your strength to stand in this hour against the wiles of the enemy and the spirits that harass and attack the saints of the most high god i'm asking you right now to honor every hand that went up in this room and let the holy ghost impart strength from the top of their head to the soles of their feet to make better choices for their lives and better choices for their family to make a better stand on what your word has made clear lord strengthen your children right now you are the beloved of the lord he's purchased you with the most costly and valuable currency there has ever been the precious blood of jesus christ you are valuable to him so valuable that he paid such an expensive price for you to belong to him now i want you to let him make you the reward for his suffering i want every one of us to let god make us the reward for how the lamb has suffered on our behalf may the glory of god and the character of jesus christ be formed in every one of those who call his name and love him in this house may the holy ghost come and strengthen each one to stand in this hour with a testimony by the compromise of this world around us if you believe that and accept that prayer by faith i want you to say amen sing something else and we'll worship before we go again hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah jesus [Music] may receive his reward through me [Music] [Music] me [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] this is our prayers may receive his reward from me we sing hallelujah [Music] [Music] [Music] lay your hand on somebody near you right now all over this building you've got more power with god than you recognize you've got more power with god than you recognize i want you to just pray for somebody's strength right now lord strengthen my brother strengthen my husband strengthen my wife strengthen my christian sister strengthen my brother by the power of the holy ghost may they be strengthened to make a stand for christ like they've never made before there's nothing to be ashamed of nothing to be embarrassed of you're praying for one another to overcome there's a room full of overcomers in this house lord strengthen my brother in the name of jesus let the holy ghost strengthen him to run the race that you have set before him may he fear no man or no devil may he be bald and courageous in the service of the lord let his life be laid down before you as a living sacrifice may he see the fulfillment of every word ever spoken over his identity in the name of jesus hallelujah [Music] that's good that's right [Music] yes [Music] that [Music] may receive his reward [Music] may receive his reward for his suffering that the land [Music] is [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] may receive his reward for his suffering that the lord may receive his reward through me that the lamb

restore i will restore what the enemy has stolen you will not walk in condemnation for i will restore saith the lord i will draw in a way that only i can draw and i will save and i will deliver in a way that only i can because i have met with you this day and i make covenant with you saith the lord do not walk in condemnation for i will redeem and restore and set in order what the enemy has destroyed for i am the god of recreation and i will do what only i can do trust me saith the lord is i don't want you to be embarrassed you know what the holy spirit is [Music] [Music] you're the only god who's the father [Music] on a video called i ask that you would minister to her need i ask you to surround her with your grace i ask you lord to give her grace to surrender her life to you oh jesus would you reveal yourself as a god who cares about her life a god who cares about her situation and her circumstances and her needs would you make yourself known to her in a way that the enemy cannot talk her out of i pray o god that you would manifest your presence into her life in the name of jesus i command every tormenting spirit to take your hands off this precious young woman i ask you with authority lord to come and give her grace to make better choices and better decisions for her life the enemy has taken advantage of her decisions and i'm asking you lord for grace to make better choices to make better decisions to be all that you would have her to be in the name of the lord jesus christ i ask this for my dear sister in your precious name amen i believe he will bless you believe he will i believe he will let them get through praise the lord i'm sorry praise the lord praise the lord you'll come over this way i'm sorry all right let's believe god for help what a tremendous difference you two can make by just trusting and believing that god is able wow i love those moments the world calls them crazy things like deja vu and all that stuff that i don't get but i love those moments that we have in god some time where you where you have this feeling i've been here before this was ordained this was supposed to happen and now we're here together believe it i want everybody that will to reach your hands toward two blood sisters who are standing here to represent a need that god sees and knows about lord i ask you right now these precious sisters stan blood sisters stand here oh god recognizing that the enemy has taken advantage far far too long now lord we know everything is in the spirit and everything isn't demonic we know that people make bad choices sometimes and pay the price but we also follow the leadership of your spirit and we recognize that there is a generational thing that the enemy likes to bind up generations with and lord we say in faith that enough is enough here is a representation of a family both sides where trouble has been spirits have manifested generational holes and generational iniquity has held and bound and twisted and tormented lies and tonight we stand here god in this moment believing for the redeeming power of the blood of jesus christ we say enough is enough we apply the blood of jesus over this situation and we command that it give way we command that it be broken and not only that we call for redemption right now generationally in the name of the lord jesus christ we call the backsliders back to you right now we call the backsliders back we call those in addiction back to even where anger has held we ask you lord for peace and love and joy to come and restoration [Music] so many forfeited gifts gifts that you have given lord that have been dropped that have been forfeited because someone has chosen a life of sin but i'm asking you right now lord to give grace to redeem every one of them that they may be used for your glory even as you use this voice today to soothe the atmosphere of this service oh god i ask you isha inaudible holy claim what's yours lord take back what is yours and use it for your glory set a whole family on edge lord in this hour the cutting edge of surrendered service to what you have for them i declare that there shall be no more delay i decree in faith o god

but she has not she has not thrived she has existed but she has not thrived lord i'm asking you to call her to a place where she can thrive where she can prosper spiritually and in every way that touches her life in the name of jesus i feel the jealousy of the lord stirred i feel the jealousy of the lord stirred for what he paid for for what he purchased with his own blood and i ask you o lord to turn the tide even today for the glory of god for the glory of god for the glory of god thank you lord thank you lord for what you're doing today thank you for what your presence is doing today we
