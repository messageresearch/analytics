[0:00] if one man can operate in the power and
[0:03] the unction of almighty god then a
[0:06] company of men and women
[0:08] can also operate in the fullness of the
[0:11] power of god
[0:19] you have been sent to time
[0:22] to carry out a plan
[0:24] of god a predestinated predetermined
[0:27] free fixed destiny plan on planet earth
[0:31] but you were originally created for
[0:33] eternity and so when time is no more and
[0:36] you step back into eternity you'll be
[0:38] back in the dimension where you were
[0:40] created to exist forever we not only
[0:43] have senses
[0:45] touch and feel and smell etc to keep us
[0:48] connected to the atmosphere and
[0:50] environment around us but god gives us
[0:52] spiritual senses
[0:54] so that we might be connected to the
[0:57] spiritual world to the heavenly world so
[1:00] that we might also bear the image of the
[1:03] heavenly i tell you
[1:05] this is what the bride is going to have
[1:07] to be in the last days she's going to
[1:10] have to bear the image of the heavenly
[1:12] there's enough earthy around us amen the
[1:15] world sees the world there's no
[1:17] transformation in seeing the world but
[1:20] you let them have a glimpse of the
[1:22] heavenly let them see that there's a
[1:24] people that will sell out to god
[1:28] that would rather be connected by the
[1:30] senses of the spirit to that which is
[1:32] spiritual than by the five senses to
[1:34] that which is earthy you just let them
[1:37] see that god will have a people fully
[1:39] adopted
[1:42] to carry his authority in the earth
[1:45] as he was the first fruits of the
[1:47] resurrection there will also be a
[1:49] harvest
[1:52] as he was the first seed to come to
[1:54] perfection there will also be a harvest
[1:57] of seed
[1:59] that's what it means that's what first
[2:01] fruits is all about it says if one man
[2:04] could be resurrected from the dead then
[2:07] many sons
[2:09] can also be resurrected from the dead if
[2:12] one man can operate in the power and the
[2:16] unction of almighty god then a company
[2:18] of men and women
[2:20] can also operate in the fullness of the
[2:23] power of god
