[0:33] and you're watching the Eagles cry we
[0:36] want to welcome you to the broadcast

[0:40] in the word of God I better say I've
[0:42] been having a wonderful time and I pray
[0:44] that you have been if you've been
[0:47] following these last few programs we've
[0:49] been preaching teaching on the theme
[0:52] from obscurity to visibility and I I
[0:55] certainly believe that that's where we
[0:57] are in the body of Christ and we want to
[0:59] continue to share perhaps uh wind up
[1:02] this theme and move on to something else
[1:04] if the holy spirit will let us but
[1:06] before we get into the word let me
[1:08] invite you to visit our web page
[1:11] revival. G on the worldwide web please
[1:15] take a moment and visit the ministry
[1:18] website there there is great information
[1:20] there for you uh I'm sure that there are
[1:23] things there that will be a blessing to

[1:49] Hallelujah and I think it's a wonderful
[1:51] way uh to help you stay in touch with
[1:53] what's going on here at the New Hope
[1:55] Revival ministries uh we are in a small
[1:58] community called Smith Station Alabama
[2:01] the address is always given to you there
[2:03] at the bottom of the screen we are in
[2:05] the United States of America and uh most
[2:08] of you have probably heard of Atlanta
[2:10] Georgia we're about 100 miles southwest
[2:12] of Atlanta Georgia and sort of in the
[2:16] country but you know God's doing
[2:18] wonderful things here we have a 60 acre
[2:21] Campground where our church Sanctuary is
[2:24] we have men's prayer chapels women's
[2:26] prayer chapels and then we also have our
[2:29] ministry Offices here and uh there are
[2:32] some young couples who live here on the
[2:34] campground and work and serve the Lord
[2:37] and serve the ministry and well lots of
[2:39] good things are happening and you can
[2:41] keep up with some of the goings on by
[2:44] visiting the website and I invite you to
[2:46] do that also send in your prayer request
[2:49] because we want to pray with you we want
[2:51] to believe God with you until the
[2:53] victory comes and then we want to praise
[2:56] God with you we want to Worship the Lord
[2:58] with you because we believe that God
[3:00] still answers prayer and he is able to
[3:04] do exceedingly and abundantly above that
[3:07] which we could even ask or think could
[3:08] we get right into the word of God we
[3:10] have a lot of ground to cover today
[3:12] we're going to read from Romans chapter
[3:15] 12 and verse one we've been reading in
[3:19] Isaiah now for the past few weeks Isaiah
[3:21] chap 58: 5 through 14 uh from obscurity
[3:27] to visibility is the theme of that verse
[3:29] of scripture but we're going to carry
[3:31] that theme a little bit farther today in
[3:34] in Romans 12: 1 and 2 verse one says I
[3:39] beseech you therefore Brethren by the
[3:42] mercies of God that you present your
[3:45] bodies a Living Sacrifice holy
[3:49] acceptable unto God which is your
[3:53] reasonable service and be not conformed
[3:58] to this world but be be ye
[4:01] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[4:05] that you may prove what is the good and
[4:10] acceptable and perfect will of God
[4:14] remember that one of the definitions of
[4:17] obscurity is uh having um uh something
[4:22] that is not clear something that needs
[4:25] to be clearer or have more clarity and
[4:29] so we see in this verse of scripture uh
[4:32] that God wants us to know and to move
[4:36] and to live in the good acceptable and
[4:40] perfect will of God well we can't always
[4:42] do that unless it's been revealed to us
[4:45] and when we say revealed we mean in
[4:48] clearness we need the Lord to make
[4:51] things very clear to us by the Holy
[4:54] Spirit and I believe that that is his
[4:56] desire he has done that for us in the
[4:59] past but what we're preaching about and
[5:01] teaching about is a theme of a new
[5:05] season in the spirit where God is just
[5:07] saying I want to so clearly reveal to
[5:11] you my will my plan my desires for you
[5:15] that you just can't miss them and you
[5:18] know we all live with a a a measure of
[5:21] fear and and maybe fear is not the best
[5:23] way to express it but we live with the
[5:25] measure of of something like fear and
[5:28] yes fear at times of missing the will of
[5:31] God not knowing the mind of God not
[5:34] recognizing exactly what God would have
[5:36] us to do but I believe that the Lord
[5:39] wants us to know and one of the ways
[5:42] that we can come to that place of
[5:44] knowing the good and perfect will of God
[5:47] Is by following the advice that's given
[5:51] to us in the scripture that we present
[5:53] our bodies a Living Sacrifice that we
[5:57] give of ourselves not not just our body
[6:00] meaning the flesh but also Body Soul and
[6:05] Spirit because man is a Triune being
[6:09] made up of body which is flesh soul and
[6:13] the inside of the inside which is the
[6:15] spirit of man and so we want to see as
[6:19] John G Lake would describe many years
[6:22] ago we want to have Triune salvation
[6:26] complete total salvation and deliverance
[6:30] in our body in our flesh in our soul and
[6:33] also in our spirit in order to do that
[6:35] we have to continuously present our
[6:38] bodies this is not something we do once
[6:40] and never have to come to God in
[6:43] humility again we do it daily as the
[6:45] Apostle Paul talked about crucifying the
[6:48] Flesh and dying daily so daily we come
[6:52] to the Lord daily we present our bodies
[6:56] as a Living Sacrifice to him holy and
[6:59] acceptable unto God that means we've got
[7:02] to find out what is pleasing to the Lord
[7:05] and that's what we need to do when we
[7:07] say holy we don't mean Holy by the
[7:09] church standard we mean Holy by God's
[7:13] standard what is it that God is looking
[7:16] for in our lives what measure uh is he
[7:20] Desiring that we come up to so that we
[7:23] can fulfill the stature of a perfect man
[7:26] that Peter was talking to us about in
[7:28] one of his Epistles we want to come to
[7:31] that place of
[7:33] transformation that this scripture talks
[7:36] about in verse two be not conformed to
[7:39] this world you know what that means it
[7:41] means don't take on the world's shape
[7:45] don't take on the image of the world
[7:48] we're looking for the image of God we
[7:52] want to become partakers of the divine
[7:55] nature of God and the spirit of this
[7:58] world is enmity with the spirit of God
[8:02] diabolically opposite to the spirit of
[8:06] God the spirit of the world is
[8:09] completely totally opposite to the
[8:12] spirit of God so we don't want to take
[8:14] on the image the shape or the form of
[8:18] this world the fashion of this world but
[8:21] we want to be
[8:22] transformed look at this be not
[8:25] conformed to this world but be ye
[8:30] transformed
[8:31] changed
[8:33] gloriously changed how by the renewing
[8:38] of your mind daily coming before the
[8:43] throne of grace asking the Lord for more
[8:47] of his favor and more of his grace to be
[8:50] able to see the renewing of our mind we
[8:54] know that discouragement is a great
[8:57] attack that the enemy launches against
[8:59] the body of Christ we talked about that
[9:01] a few weeks ago right here on the
[9:03] broadcast one of the ways that we can
[9:06] maintain encouragement and stay away
[9:09] from discouragement is to remind
[9:12] ourselves daily what God is doing for us
[9:16] and what he has done for us meditate on
[9:20] the faithfulness of God and not spend
[9:23] all of our time pondering on the
[9:26] promises that have not yet been
[9:28] fulfilled the things that we would yet
[9:30] love to see God do and he hasn't done
[9:33] and we want to remember those promises
[9:35] they're precious we want to hold on to
[9:37] them we want to believe God for the
[9:39] future fulfillment of all that he has
[9:41] spoken but we want to be faithful as God
[9:45] has proven faithful we want to be
[9:47] faithful to praise him to worship him to
[9:50] to go around with a spirit of
[9:52] thankfulness and Thanksgiving for what
[9:55] he has done and for what he's going to
[9:58] do oh I I love him I love serving the
[10:02] lord Jesus Christ he never fails he is
[10:06] exactly what he said he would be and he
[10:09] keeps his word you know men sometimes
[10:12] are slack in keeping their promises but
[10:16] God is Not slack concerning his promise
[10:20] if he promises it he means to bring it
[10:24] to pass and as we said before he may not
[10:27] come when you want him but he's right on
[10:30] time God moves in a different time zone
[10:34] a time uh uh scale than what you and I
[10:38] we move on Kronos time that is measured
[10:42] by the calendar by the sand hourglass
[10:46] the sand in The Hourglass or the sun on
[10:49] the sun dial or the watch on our wrist
[10:53] but God's time his timing is different
[10:57] and we may think that that it's passed
[10:59] due and God may say no it's not time yet
[11:02] so that's one of the reasons why in this
[11:04] hour of God bringing us from a place of
[11:08] of Shadow obscurity into a spotlight
[11:12] unveiling us because he's been working
[11:15] on us getting us ready for this great
[11:17] showdown of God's power where we're
[11:20] going to go forth and and give life to
[11:23] those who are needy we're going to speak
[11:25] words of Deliverance to those that are
[11:27] oppressed we're going to heal the sick
[11:30] and raise the dead and set the captives
[11:32] free we're going to minister in the love
[11:35] and compassion of Jesus Christ and
[11:38] before we do that we've been in this
[11:41] great time of equipping and preparation
[11:44] and that takes place behind the veil
[11:46] underneath the great curtain but God's
[11:49] getting ready to to uh uh snatch off the
[11:52] veil and to unveil his Masterpiece the
[11:56] living bride of Jesus Christ what will
[11:59] she look like just like the bridegroom
[12:03] what would she speak just what the
[12:05] bridegroom would speak what will she do
[12:09] just what our lord Jesus Yeshua the
[12:12] Messiah our Heavenly bridegroom what he
[12:14] would do she will have thus saith the
[12:18] Lord and when she speaks she will speak
[12:21] the mind of God and angels will hasten
[12:25] to perform that which she the bride of
[12:28] Christ the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ
[12:31] yes the adopted sons of God all of these
[12:35] scriptural um analogies these scriptural
[12:40] examples that we paradigms that we have
[12:43] looked at over the years they're all
[12:44] culminating and consummating In This
[12:48] Moment Hallelujah that's why it's so
[12:50] important as I said a moment ago that we
[12:53] as Believers those who are filled with
[12:55] the spirit of God that we don't live our
[12:57] lives based on on chronos's time but
[13:00] we're more interested in Ciro's time the
[13:03] timing of the Lord those seasons of
[13:06] heightened spiritual activity when the
[13:09] Lord is saying this is the season for
[13:12] such and such if God says this is a
[13:15] season for healing then we want to get
[13:17] the sick in we want to bring the sick in
[13:20] so that they can be healed if God says
[13:22] uh in this coming hour I'm going to
[13:24] begin to deliver the drug addicts like
[13:27] never before we want to know that we
[13:29] want to be sensitive to his will we want
[13:32] to hear his voice clearly so that we can
[13:34] bring the drug addicts in the times and
[13:38] Seasons knowing them Discerning them and
[13:40] walking in them is one of the most
[13:42] important things that the body of Christ
[13:43] must learn to do in this last hour one
[13:47] of the ways that we learn this is by the
[13:49] renewing of our mind by meditating on
[13:52] the word of God by not looking at
[13:54] present circumstances but standing in
[13:57] the word of God firmly rooted and
[14:01] grounded in thus saith the word of God
[14:05] be not conformed to this world verse two
[14:08] but be ye transformed changed totally
[14:12] revolutionized by the renewing of your
[14:15] mind that's how important the mind is
[14:18] that's how important and you know you
[14:20] hear a lot of talk about the Mind Body
[14:22] Connection and I know people may take
[14:24] that to the extreme but one day I was
[14:27] praying for some friends that I love
[14:29] very dearly and God said uh it's all in
[14:32] the mind tell them it's all in the mind
[14:34] it's a mind thing and we started
[14:36] preaching a little bit on the mind and
[14:38] uh one of God's Great generals brother
[14:41] brandham William Branham uh uh in one of
[14:44] his great messages great fiery sermons
[14:47] he talked about the the Battlefield of
[14:50] the Mind and he said it's in the
[14:52] Battlefield of the Mind that the
[14:53] greatest battle that's ever been fought
[14:56] is being fought in this hour you you see
[14:58] Satan wants to to uh war against you in
[15:02] your mind and in your thought process he
[15:04] wants to keep you from being able to
[15:06] inherit the promises he wants to uh
[15:10] discourage you and he wants to
[15:12] disqualify you because he his ultimate
[15:16] goal is to derail you from your destiny
[15:18] he wants to dissect you from your
[15:21] destiny he wants to cut it aund a the
[15:25] lifeline he wants to cut off the
[15:26] lifeline if you will so that you are no
[15:29] longer connected to the plans and
[15:31] purposes of God but we say no we say no
[15:34] to the devil we say no to the enemy and
[15:37] and we claim that by the authority of
[15:39] Jesus Christ we say no over our children
[15:42] we say no over our families we just
[15:45] serve notice on the enemy you cannot
[15:47] have our loved ones we're Standing on
[15:51] the Promises of God's word daily being
[15:54] transformed daily being changed by the
[15:57] renewing of our minds that we may be
[15:59] able to prove not just talk
[16:02] about it's one thing to talk about it
[16:05] it's another thing to be able to
[16:07] demonstrate it and that's what we're
[16:09] after in this hour the grace of God to
[16:11] be able to prove what is that good and
[16:15] acceptable and perfect will of God and
[16:19] we can find that in the scripture what
[16:21] God's will is his will is for you to
[16:23] prosper his will is for you to be in
[16:25] good health his will is for you to walk
[16:27] in the spirit and not after the flesh
[16:30] his will is for there to be healing in
[16:32] your hands his will is for you to be
[16:34] able to speak with the power of the
[16:36] spoken word and Watch God's word uh come
[16:39] to pass right before your eyes now when
[16:43] we look at that word transformed in the
[16:46] Greek be ye not conformed to this world
[16:49] but be you transformed by the renewing
[16:52] of your mind in Greek that word is the
[16:55] is the root word of where we get the
[16:58] word
[17:00] metamorphosis it's like metamorpho and
[17:03] we use that word metamorphosis we all
[17:06] learned it in school remember in the
[17:09] early years of science we learned a big
[17:12] word metamorphosis which is a an extreme
[17:16] change and what uh what were the
[17:19] circumstances that we learned the word
[17:22] metamorphosis do you do you remember do
[17:24] you recall it is concerning the
[17:27] caterpillar
[17:28] and the Butterfly and I have some notes
[17:32] here I don't like to read a lot of notes
[17:34] to you on the eagle cry but I want to
[17:36] read these notes to you just a little
[17:38] bit then that word renew the renewing of
[17:40] your mind it means a renovation
[17:43] Hallelujah uh complete change for the
[17:46] better and that's what we're looking for
[17:48] a renovation of the Mind a complete
[17:51] change for the better instead of
[17:53] thinking the the negative thoughts the
[17:56] doubtful thoughts we want to think what
[17:58] God God would have us to think but I did
[18:00] a little research some years ago about
[18:02] this metamorphosis that takes place the
[18:05] the caterpillar you know it's this
[18:07] little worm and he eats and eats and
[18:09] eats and eats and eats in fact he eats
[18:12] his own eggshell so he comes into the
[18:14] world eating and then he eats leaves and
[18:17] everything that he can find and he eats
[18:20] so much that he gets so fat that his
[18:23] skin breaks and he sheds his skin and
[18:26] and science says that one particular
[18:29] caterpillar can shed his skin four or
[18:31] five different times and that reminds me
[18:34] of of what I've experienced in the
[18:36] spirit you know sometimes we learn and
[18:38] we grow and we we get stretched and we
[18:41] expand and we lose our skin and God has
[18:44] to give us a new wine skin but that's
[18:47] all right that's okay that's what this
[18:49] is all about growing and and growth
[18:52] there are 90,000 different varieties of
[18:55] caterpillars that make butterflies this
[18:58] caterpillar uses liquid from its own
[19:00] body to spin a little button of silk on
[19:03] some solid object like a twig of a tree
[19:06] or something it then spins a silk girdle
[19:10] to hold itself upside down connected to
[19:13] this little silk button the pupus thorax
[19:17] swells breaking open again the
[19:19] caterpillar's skin eventually a hard
[19:22] shell forms over the pupa called a
[19:25] chrysalis and you've seen that it's a
[19:27] beautiful stage where the caterpillar is
[19:30] not caterpillar and it's not butterfly
[19:33] yet oh it's somewhere in between and the
[19:36] pupa does not eat at this stage while
[19:39] the greatest changes are taking place
[19:41] and you know what I say about that is we
[19:44] we need to eat the word of God Feast on
[19:46] the word of God while we have the
[19:48] opportunity to do so Amos said that
[19:50] there is a famine of uh not of bread or
[19:53] water but a famine of hearing the word
[19:55] of the Lord and and uh of course there
[19:58] are times where we go through spiritual
[20:00] droughts and spiritual famines and so I
[20:03] think it's very important to get as much
[20:05] of God's word in us when circumstances
[20:09] are going good so that when we begin to
[20:11] face the fiery Trials of Life we've got
[20:13] a foundation to stand on so eat eat eat
[20:17] you're like a little caterpillar eat
[20:19] God's word eat it eat it eat it because
[20:23] it's doing something we may not feel the
[20:26] transformation but it's taking place on
[20:29] the
[20:30] inside these changes can take as little
[20:32] as 10 days or as long as 8 months when
[20:35] the adult butterfly is formed inside the
[20:38] shell it gives off a fluid that loosens
[20:41] itself from the shell see God's got
[20:44] everything under control the thorax
[20:46] swells to crack the shell when it makes
[20:49] its way out its outer skeleton is still
[20:52] soft and its wings are only little pads
[20:55] by tightening its muscles it pumps air
[20:58] and blood through its body and wings the
[21:01] body hardens and the wings flatten also
[21:04] and expand in about 30 minutes the
[21:07] butterfly is ready to fly now I want you
[21:10] to know this is quite a metamorphosis
[21:13] from this little worm crawling along on
[21:16] the branch to now being so transformed
[21:21] so changed that it's no longer a worm
[21:24] it's no longer a little creature that
[21:26] has to depend on C falling but now it
[21:30] has a set of
[21:31] wings what a change and this is the same
[21:36] word that's used here in Romans 12 and2
[21:41] but be ye transformed metamorpho where
[21:45] we get this science of
[21:48] metamorphosis What A change is taking
[21:51] place so you know when the enemy tries
[21:53] to discourage you and call you an old
[21:55] worm you just feel like an old worm well
[21:57] you just tell him I may be a worm today
[21:59] but tomorrow I'm going to be a butterfly
[22:03] they sing an old country song Some have
[22:05] kind of made it a gospel song that says
[22:07] I'm just an old chunk of coal but I'm
[22:10] going to be a diamond one day that's a
[22:13] promise of God I claim that I claim that
[22:16] but uh I I must tell you did you know
[22:19] what it takes to make coal transformed
[22:23] into a diamond it takes time and it
[22:26] takes lots and lots and lots and lots of
[22:29] pressure pressure and you know we're
[22:33] experiencing pressure from the inside
[22:35] and from the outside life can get hard
[22:38] but oh how sweet it is to know that no
[22:42] matter how hard life can become our God
[22:46] is with us and he is an awesome God who
[22:50] never fails who is never given us a
[22:53] reason to think that he would ever fail
[22:56] and this great process that's taking
[22:58] place behind the veil this metamorpho
[23:02] metamorphosis this transformation as our
[23:05] mind is being renewed as we are being
[23:09] Sanctified cleaned set apart by the
[23:12] washing of the water of the word until
[23:15] we come to that place where the Lord
[23:17] Jesus says here she is she's just like
[23:20] me she's in my image and for a quick
[23:22] short spell I'm going to loose her and
[23:25] let her have a Ministry in the earth I
[23:28] believe that with all my heart I'd like
[23:31] to share and I I don't have but just a
[23:33] very few uh um minutes to do that but
[23:37] I'd like to share just a a couple places
[23:40] in the song of songs in the King James
[23:43] version of the Bible it says uh The Song
[23:45] of Solomon but Solomon named it himself
[23:49] the song of songs which belongs to
[23:52] Solomon or or given by Solomon in the
[23:56] song of songs chapter 1 verse one but
[23:59] anyway in chapter 2 verse 8 it says the
[24:04] voice of my beloved and of course
[24:05] there's not time to develop this whole
[24:08] scenario but this is h a love story
[24:11] between Solomon and uh his uh this
[24:14] beautiful woman that he has fallen in
[24:16] love with but we believe that
[24:18] prophetically it talks about the love
[24:21] affair the love relationship between our
[24:24] Heavenly bridegroom the Lord Jesus
[24:26] Christ and his bride and when we say
[24:28] bride we mean the one new man bride so
[24:31] we're not just talking about uh a Jewish
[24:34] bride we know God has a covenant with
[24:36] Israel and the Jewish people but we know
[24:38] that because Messiah has come he has
[24:41] torn down the middle wall of partition
[24:43] Romans chapter 11 and he has allowed us
[24:46] to be grafted in and we now stand before
[24:48] him as one new man so this is a
[24:51] beautiful beautiful love story okay so
[24:54] chapter 2 ver8 the voice of my beloved
[24:58] behold he cometh leaping upon the
[25:00] mountains skipping upon the hills my
[25:02] beloved is like a rower a young heart
[25:04] behold he standeth behind our wall he
[25:06] lookth forth at the windows showing
[25:09] himself through the lattice do you know
[25:11] what lattice work is it's the like
[25:14] crisscross you know and so you're only
[25:16] seeing through a portion of the of the
[25:20] openings the lattice and that's what I
[25:22] want to say I want to say that our
[25:24] bridegroom has been appearing to us in
[25:27] the Spirit through his word through his
[25:29] manifest presence but over the years it
[25:32] has been more like he's been standing
[25:34] behind the lattice but there's an
[25:36] unveiling that's taking place it's a
[25:39] dual unveiling he is unveiling himself
[25:43] revealing himself to us and by doing so
[25:47] we are being transformed by the renewing
[25:49] of our mind we are being change and then
[25:52] he's going to unveil us as his
[25:55] Masterpiece do you follow me I think
[25:57] it's it's a tremendous truth that we
[25:59] need to get a hold of verse 10 my
[26:01] beloved spake and said unto me rise up
[26:03] my love my fair one and come away for Lo
[26:07] the winter is passed the rain is over
[26:09] and gone verse 13 the Fig Tree putteth
[26:14] forth her green figs and the vines with
[26:16] a tender grape give a good smell Arise
[26:19] My Love My Fair one and come away this
[26:21] is the wooing of the bridegroom the
[26:24] calling of the bridegroom oh my Dove ver
[26:27] vers 14 Thou Art In The Cliffs Of The
[26:30] Rock in the secret places of the stairs
[26:33] now I love that now real quickly go to
[26:36] Song of Songs or Song of Solomon Chapter
[26:38] 3: 6 who is this that cometh out of the
[26:42] Wilderness like pillars of smoke
[26:44] perfumed with myrr and frankincense with
[26:46] all powders of the merchant when we read
[26:50] these next few verses it's describing
[26:52] Solomon the bridegroom so when we when
[26:55] we get it when God reveals it to us by
[26:58] the spirit what we're reading in these
[27:00] verses is a beautiful prophetic picture
[27:04] of the coming of the bridegroom he
[27:06] unveils himself first he reveals himself
[27:10] first he steps out from behind the
[27:12] lattice and comes into Plain View I mean
[27:15] the fullness is what I'm looking for the
[27:18] fullness of Messiah knowing him
[27:22] intimately acquainted with him being
[27:25] changed by soaking in his presence well
[27:29] my time is gone and I've certainly
[27:32] enjoyed it father I just release the
[27:35] spirit of all that has been spoken let
[27:37] it go forth let it stir in people's
[27:40] hearts and may we all become hungry for
[27:43] more of you in the wonderful name of the
[27:45] Lord Jesus Yeshua we pray amen thank you
[27:48] for watching the Eagles cry byebye for
[27:56] today
