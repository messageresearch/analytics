Description:
In Him was life and that life was the light of men. We carry that light, making us His torchbearers; the carriers of His Life!

We push our way into another dimension of glory through worship & then it is time to just be quiet and listen for God to speak.

We believe there is unlimited power in the Word of God to bring transformation to the life of the believer. Our media is here for just that – a channel to deliver anointed and revelatory truth to facilitate revival in your life.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but i do not have to surrender the light our refuge is a person in this person there is a place in this place there is a peace there is a rest that comes and from that peace in that peace there is a posture there is a position that we can stand and that is one who looks the enemy eye to eye who can stand toe to toe with the destroyer and say i am not afraid of you my god is a refuge and a very present help in the time of trouble and i will not yield one inch as long as you are light as long as you have his life in him was life and his life whoa what's the light of men and the light shine and the darkness could not put it out so as long as you and i are on planet earth there is a measure of sanity that must remain and there is a light bearing that can never be put out where is the light you and i are bearers we are torch bearers we are carriers of the light and that light is the life of jesus christ and all the gates of hell will march against that light but i don't care how dark it gets out there i can't change that but i do not have to surrender the light his life is the light of men and it's in the bride our refuge is not some mystical misty place out there in the in the eons of of eternity and time our refuge is a person and he lives inside of the believer there's a hiding place right in here
