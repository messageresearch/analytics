[0:00] the spoken creative word that caused the
[0:03] earth to come into existence that took
[0:05] body form flesh forms the invisible
[0:16] spirit of god the almighty eternal
[0:20] spirit of the Father we could call that
[0:24] a lot of things we can call it spirit we
[0:28] can call it light we can call it love we
[0:32] can call it a lot of different things
[0:34] but it's spirit and it has to find a way
[0:38] to become to manifest to accomplish
[0:42] something it has to have a form or a
[0:45] symbol a form or assemble in the Old
[0:49] Testament how did the logos manifest
[0:51] itself it manifested itself as a pillar
[0:55] of fire right but that fire was God but
[0:59] there had to be some other forms and
[1:03] manifestations of God because spirit
[1:06] can't bleed spirit can't die the eternal
[1:12] spirit of the Father could not be
[1:14] crucified and could not suffer it could
[1:17] not bleed so it had to take on another
[1:21] form when God looked at all of his
[1:24] attributes he decided in that one moment
[1:27] just exactly how he would express every
[1:32] one of those attributes for all eternity
[1:35] it all happened in one speck one eternal
[1:40] second because there was no time one
[1:44] second of eternity one flash of eternity
[1:47] God said here's how I'm gonna do it
[1:49] I'm
[1:50] let this happen in the garden I'm gonna
[1:52] provide this I'm gonna give a law I'm
[1:54] gonna have a temple I'm gonna have
[1:55] offering I'm gonna have sacrifices and
[1:57] then eventually four thousand years
[1:59] later I'm gonna step down out of
[2:01] eternity and take on a person the word
[2:05] will become flesh as we read in John 1:1
[2:08] and I'm gonna bleed but I'm not gonna
[2:10] believe you Minh blood I'm gonna believe
[2:13] a blood that I create because in that
[2:16] blood there will be nothing provided
[2:19] from the mother and there will be
[2:20] nothing provided from an earthly father
[2:22] because I'm going to overshadow a woman
[2:25] my God have mercy I'm gonna overshadow a
[2:28] woman and she's gonna become pregnant
[2:30] just because the Spirit of God moved on
[2:32] her father was spirit the Heavenly
[2:36] Father was spirit and in order for you
[2:40] to have a sacrifice on your behalf
[2:44] spirit became body spirit became flesh
[2:48] creative word became body think of it
[2:52] this way the spoken creative word that
[2:55] caused the earth to come into existence
[2:57] that took body for flesh for it's so
[3:02] powerful
[3:03] because some of you may not be able to
[3:05] go this far but there's been a promise
[3:07] that in the last of the last days that
[3:10] same life that was in Jesus Christ
[3:13] because of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[3:15] because of election because of a message
[3:18] that reveals Jesus Christ in a way that
[3:20] he was never revealed before and all the
[3:22] other church ages because of all that
[3:24] that same spirit life comes into men and
[3:27] women comes into men and women and
[3:30] starts transforming them from the inside
[3:33] out
