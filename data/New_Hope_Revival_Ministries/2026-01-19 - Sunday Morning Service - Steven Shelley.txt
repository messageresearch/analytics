TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. I heard an old old story. How a savior came from glory. how he gave his life on Calvary to save a wretch like me. I heard about his groaning of his precious blood atoning. Then I repented of my sins and won the victory. Victory in Jesus, my savior forever. Well, he sought me and he bought me with his redeeming blood. He loved me. I knew him and all my love is to him. He punched me to victory beneath the cleansing. I heard about his healing of his cleansing power, revealing how he made the lame to walk again. And he caused the blind to see. And then I cried, "Dear Jesus, come and heal my broken spirit." And somehow Jesus came and brought to me the victory. Well, victory in Jesus my savior forever. Well, he sought me and he bought me with his redeeing blood. Oh, he loved me. I knew him and all my love. It is through him. He punched me to victory beneath the cleansing blood. I heard about that mansion he has built for me in glory. And I heard about the streets of gold just beyond the crystal sea. And about the angels singing and that old redemption story. You know, in some sweet day I'll sing up there that song of victory. Well, victory in Jesus, my savior forever. He sought me and he bought me with his redeeing blood. Oh, he loved me and I knew him.

There grew arose among the weeds a beauty unmbbraced. Perfection out of place. &gt;&gt; Our God, the King among the thieves. It feels like poetry and body. The carpenter upon the tree. He died against the grain. Just like he lived each day became the message that he preached. Oh hallelu with hands lifted high. What else would I do but give you my heart and my hallelu? Lord, for all that you've done. &gt;&gt; The least I could do is give you my heart and my hallelujah. My hallelujah. We really should have seen it coming cuz he even said how many days an earthquake in the cave and that stone was rolled away. Who puts a God inside a grave? Yeah. And you can't keep God inside a grave. Oh, with hands lifted high. What else would I do, Lord? But give you my heart and my hallelujah. Oh Lord, for all that you've done. The least I could do, Lord, is give you my heart and my hallelujah. My hallelujah. And I will praise the one who left his mark on Calary. I will praise the one who left the grave but kept those keys. He is alive. He is alive and he forever more will be. Now the wonderworking power is alive in me. And I will praise the one who left his mark on Calary. And I will praise the one who left the grave but kept those peace. He is alive. He is alive and he forever more will be. Now the wonder working power is alive in me. And I will praise the one who left his mark on Calary. And I will praise the one who left the grave. But he kept those keys. He is alive. He is alive. And he forever more will be. Now the wonder working power is alive in me. &gt;&gt; Someday in skies above Goltha &gt;&gt; on clouds like stallions he'll descend. The trumpet starts to blaze and the saints erupt in praise. The king is coming back again. Yeah. And our king is coming back again. Oh hallelu. With hands lifted high. What else would I do? Lord, but just give you my heart. Oh, and my hallelu for all that you've done. Lord, the least I could do. Oh, is to give you my heart. And hallelu with hands lifted high. What else would I do but give you my heart, my hallelujah, for all that you've done. The least I could do is give you my heart. Oh, hallelu. With hands lifted high, what else would I do but give you my heart and my hallelu, Lord, for all that you've done. The least I could do is give you my heart and my hallelujah. My hallelujah Lord. As we lift our hands to you, we give you our heart. We give you our hallelujah. We give you everything that we are because you are worthy. You are worthy of praise and adoration and we give it to you today, Lord. Wonderful King of glory, blessed redeemer, the one who picked us up out of where we were and you set us above it. I thank you, Lord. I thank you, Lord. We give you our heart. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Everything that we are, Lord, &gt;&gt; any of those places that we have not allowed you into, we give it to you today, Lord. We open up everything that we are to you. We don't want to hold back one little thing. Not one thing, Lord. We belong to you in totality. Great is your goodness and faithfulness to us. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. As we're getting ready to pray today, would you have a need by the lifting of the hand? You just want to lift it to the Lord. Say, "I have a need." Out across the stream, the Lord sees your need. Though we may not be able to see your hand, our Lord sees it. He sees your need and he knows how to answer that need. Let's continue to remember brother Paul Drowned to the Lord that God will give him a healing miracle. Sister Audrey Lewis that the Lord will continue his work and heal her body. Brother Man's uncle is very low. He'd like to be remembered to the Lord in prayer. And Sister Man's dad is in the hospital and he also needs a mighty touch. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Jacob reached out because he's on shift today and Hope was unsure about the road up that way and we want to lift them up to the Lord. Stephen and Lydia have traveled home to Indiana. So, we want to hold on to them. And I know many of you were blessed Tuesday night like I was. And we want to pray for our brother Josh and and Kayla and those beautiful children that they have that everywhere they go between now and the end of February that God will anoint the givers. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and that every need that they have for their next uh run on the field would be supplied and that God would give them souls. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; I I believe the Lord would honor and bless us if we would remember to hold them up to him in prayer and uh I should have some good news from Jerusalem in the next few days it looks like. So let's please keep praying for that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let's take these needs to the Lord today. Hey, will you sing this little song as we're preparing? It is so sweet to trust in Jesus. just to take him at his word. Just to rest upon his promise, just to know the saith the Lord Jesus. Jesus. How I trust him. How I've proved him more and more. Jesus. Jesus. Precious Jesus. Oh, for grace. Sing of course again. Nathan, will you come and pray, please? Jesus. Jesus. How I trust him. How I prove him more and more. Jesus. Jesus. Precious Jesus. Oh to trust him more. Let's pray. Yes. &gt;&gt; Father in heaven, we love you. &gt;&gt; We thank you, Lord, that you have given us another opportunity to come together with these saints of like precious faith, this family of God, to gather in your name, oh God, to be in your presence as a family. &gt;&gt; Lord, we thank you that you've come in this house, oh Lord. Thank you, Lord, that you are answering needs as the service goes on. That you're answering questions that are before you, oh Lord. that you're touching sick bodies, oh God. Lifting up those who are down. &gt;&gt; We thank you for it, Lord. For each need that was called aloud and for each need that's represented here that's held in our heart. There are so many, Lord. &gt;&gt; We have so much on our heart and in our mind because the days are growing short. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But Lord, I believe that you are the answer. Lord, every sick body, every sick mind, &gt;&gt; every financial need, &gt;&gt; every need of the heart, oh God, &gt;&gt; for everyone who came in here today with a need before you, with a question that they want answered, &gt;&gt; those that are hungry for you, &gt;&gt; I ask, oh Lord, that you would move in each case. Oh God, you said, "Blessed be the hungry, for they shall be filled." And Lord, I'm seeking for an answer from you. I ask Lord for the hails as they travel that you would be with them, oh Lord, and that you would give them safety on the roadways. And Lord, that you would continue to speak to them and draw them. Oh God, &gt;&gt; that what they do would be eternal. Oh God, &gt;&gt; what you're doing in them is eternal. &gt;&gt; Lord, as we sit under the word today, speak to our hearts. Be with our pastor as he speaks, oh God. Anoint his lips, oh God, that he would speak directly to each one of us. said, "May our ears be attentive to hear what you would have to say today. Oh God, we thank you for all these things in the name of Jesus Christ." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We give you praise, Lord. We give you praise for you're worthy. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. You may have your seats today. What a blessing it is to be gathered in the house of the Lord together with you. All of you out across the stream. We're glad that you have joined us in this service by way of the stream. It's a whole lot better inside here all gathered together, but sometimes it doesn't work out that you can be here. I pray the presence of the Lord will go over that camera and minister to you the way that he does to us here. Sister Naomi, it's sure glad to see you here. We're glad to see you here in the house of the Lord today. God bless you, Sister Sarah Robson. It's good to have you and the children. Johnny, we're glad that you're here today. Joshua has a co-orker with him there. Jordan, we're glad that you're here with us today. The Lord bless you. So thankful for the presence of the Lord in the house. thankful that he is here working among us and doing in us what we can't do for ourselves. If we can get ourselves in a place where that we surrender as he is uh coming among us while we're worshiping him, he can do more &gt;&gt; in a split second &gt;&gt; than all of our years of striving. So true. &gt;&gt; I'm glad for the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Kate is going to get ready to sing as we're worshiping together, getting ready for the preaching of the word. Joyce and I would like to thank you for welcoming her niece and family, Josh and Kayla Hail, and how generous that you were to them. The Lord bless you and thank you so much for welcoming them and being generous to them to the work of the Lord that they're doing. Um Josh told me that there were some that wanted some of those little cards that you would remember to pray for them. I laid them on that little sideboard table out there as you're going out the door. If you would like to have one, there are more of them back there. Uh we're going to receive the tithe and offering giving to the work of the Lord. giving to what the Lord has called us to to see the purposes of God fulfilled uh in in this house and on this ground. What he has called us to in the end time. We give of our tithe and offering gladly to him and we're thankful that he has blessed us to be able to give. He is the one who supplies everything that we have. It is because of him that we live and move and even have breath in our body. And he gives us the strength to labor with our hands. He gives us the strength to carry on from day to day. If you're retired, he gave you the strength in time past. And he continues to look after you. You know, I don't think there are any of us here today that are starving. I don't think there are any of us here that are destitute. God supplies all of our need. And I am thankful for that. Brother Elas, will you and uh Brother Austin Yantis go to the people today as we're worshiping together in our giving and we lift our voices to worship with brother Cade as we're getting ready for the preaching of the word. Somebody here needs an answer to the questions, the fears and the wise. Somebody here is desperate for freedom from the past and the chains and the lies. Feels like you wasted so much time. Want to move ahead, but you're still last in line. Feels like you're running will never end. And you will never win. Oh, but I don't know who told you you would not make it. And I don't know who told you you could not take it. And I don't know who told you it's time that you quit. Oh, but my God says wait, cuz it ain't over yet. Somebody here needs an answer to the questions and the fears and the wise. Somebody here is desperate for freedom from the past and the chains and the lies. Feels like you wasted so much time. Want to move ahead, but you're still lasting line. Feels like you're running will never end. And you will never win. But I don't know who told you you would not make it. And I don't know who told you you could not take it. And I don't know who told you it's time that you quit. But my God says wait cuz it ain't over yet. Oh, it ain't over till I say it's over. And I say that this thing. No, it ain't over yet. It ain't over till I say it's over. And I say that missing. It ain't over yet. Oh, hold on a little longer. Oh, cuz this thing know it ain't over yet. I don't know who told you you would not make it. And I don't know who told you you could not take it. And I don't know who told you it's time that you quit, but my God says wait, cuz it ain't over yet. Oh, and I don't know who told you you would not make it. And I don't know who told you you would not take it. And I don't know who told you it's time that you quit. But I've got a God that says, "Wait, it ain't over yet." Oh, it ain't over till I say it's over. And I say that this ain't it ain't over yet. It ain't over till I say it's over and I say that this it ain't over yet. Hold on a little longer. Cause this thing it ain't over yet. I don't know who told you you would not make it. And I don't know who told you you could not take it. And I don't know who told you it's time that you quit. &gt;&gt; You better stop this. &gt;&gt; God says, "Wait." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It ain't over yet. &gt;&gt; Come on. My God says, "Wait, wait. It ain't over yet." &gt;&gt; Well, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad the devil doesn't get the last word? God gets the last word. &gt;&gt; Let's give God some praise. Come on. Wonderful Lord. &gt;&gt; Wonderful Jesus. Good job. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Isn't he good? &gt;&gt; You may be seated for just a moment. The victory is ours. It's already been won &gt;&gt; on our behalf. The lamb has won the victory. Praise God. We are here to appropriate the victory that the lamb has won on our behalf. And that is not a passive thing. That's an active thing. In fact, it's a daily thing. We have to put the blood of Jesus and the authority of the word into every situation that we face. &gt;&gt; If we miss one, we'll sink &gt;&gt; and we'll have to call out to him. Uh, and I'm thankful that if we do, he'll be there. &gt;&gt; But why would you want to maintain when you can you can grow and you can move higher in him? &gt;&gt; Well, we were blessed here Tuesday night. And uh we realized that our brother took a a bit of a a risk because he is not a part of uh the movement that we are in. If there if we are in a movement, I'm not sure. But uh anyway, we don't normally fellowship with the same folks, but uh he sort of represents our history, my history, and most specifically Sister Joyce's history. And it's did us pretty good. It did us quite well until we could get all the truth. But I wouldn't want to do anything that would uh I'm not going to be calling his name a lot over the pullpit. And uh I don't want to do anything that would jeopardize his ability to reach the community that God has sent him to. &gt;&gt; But we will continue to support him in prayer and in finances. If you so desire to do that, we will absolutely continue to do that because we believe that when the spirit of truth comes, &gt;&gt; he knows how to lead. He was telling me about a little girl in the community there that maybe she doesn't always dress like they would prefer for her to dress, but she's a poor girl and she hasn't had any kind of training except the example that they've been setting for her. and they found a little dress that they was a little longer than what she has has had and and uh they bought it for her at a at a thrift store, secondhand store so that she could wear it on Easter Sunday. And she was so proud of that dress. Nobody said, "Hey, here's a more appropriate dress." They just said, "Here's a dress for you to wear." And she was so proud of that dress and so thankful for it that when they got ready to leave, she she came up to him and she said, "Hey, where did you say you all got that dress?" She said, "I'm saving to get me some more." She said, "I like I like those I like those dresses. I like longer dresses." And he said, "I tell you what, you don't have to worry about nothing. When I come back, when we get back from the States, I guarantee you we'll have an armful of dresses for you." And he said, "We just let the Lord deal with her heart." And he was preparing her and we just did what he said and give her that little dress. And she immediately began to feel like that was more appropriate in life. You know, that's how the spirit of God works. &gt;&gt; A and after all, that's not the that's not the major point. That's not the main thing. Even brother Brandham rebukes us for majoring on minors. And uh modesty is essential when you have the truth. Uh you'll never find compromise uh with me on that. I believe in holiness and I believe in separation. But I believe that these things have to be the overflow of a changed heart. &gt;&gt; And that little girl's having her heart changed by love. Not by quotes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By love. &gt;&gt; And I I'm behind that 100%. Some of you have asked about our brother who's doing a work for the Lord in Israel. We also do not call his name uh because we want to protect his identity as much as we possibly can. He's sometimes in a dangerous place, in a dangerous position, but we pray that the Lord will continue to bless him. And there there have been through the years a few people who have paid their tithe on PayPal. And I don't encourage you to do that because the fees are a little bit higher than what we have through our online giving. But it has been convenient for a few people out of the country. And because of that, even though it's tithe, I've been not taking my portion of that. And uh when we could, we've been sending uh some uh usually $1,000 at a time to our brother in Israel for the work that he's doing. And the last time it was around Hanukkah time and he sent a note to say, "You will never know. You will never know how uh needed and appreciated it was. It came at a very very perfect time. Food in Israel is expensive and and uh utilities and things are expensive. So there are always those two opportunities before you if you want to sew into them. If you want to specify them uh in mission, you can just do that. just write missions and then if you want to specify it uh to uh to the name that was called in the prayer uh then we will do that or you could just say brother Josh and uh we'll know that it's not our brother Josh because he hadn't hit the mission field yet and it's not my Josh because he hasn't hit the mission field yet except for trips with dad but uh if they ever decide to go and spend their life that way we'll do our best to support them at that time. In the meantime, we'll support those who are there. Brother Brandham talks about uh if if you if you can go, it's a high calling to go. And if you can't go, you can send someone. And so, you got together. The first offering that we took here Tuesday night was only $500. And then someone had written a personal check directly to them for $500. I didn't know about the personal one at the time, but when they sent me the total, I said, "There's no way in the world." And it wasn't a real good time for us to just pull from somewhere else cuz I had been doing that all week long, pulling from somewhere else. And so, I just had that uncction. I hope you didn't feel pressured. Uh, but it worked if you did because I just felt an uncction to ask again. Would you, you've heard it now. you've heard the you've heard what they're doing. And you know, before they left here that night, uh there I think there was another $500 check perhaps that was given that was made directly to them. And the check was a the church was able to write them a check for $3,000. And I tell you, that's that's that makes me so happy and so proud of you. It wasn't in the budget, but you met the need for the evening, and I really appreciate you doing that. And I know that God will bless you. I know he will. Uh, let's stand. I When Cade sings like that, you know how I struggle because it makes me want to sing. But I'm going to pass it up this time. Let's thank God for these musicians. All they give, all they do. A few days ago, we weren't sure if if Benjamin was going to be able to be here today, and he's missed some from being in on the West Coast and and he he had a little sickness to hit him, but God really touched him. I'm so thankful for that. And it seems that most everybody is getting rid of their stuff and and uh let's be real careful. Now is the now is the is the important time. Now is the be careful time that you that you don't get it again or get somebody else's. So, uh maybe people get tired of hearing practical advice, but it's a good idea to keep your hands clean. &gt;&gt; And I know your mama told you, but you ignored her, so maybe you'll believe me. Uh you'd be surprised the difference that it will make. And even a nasal rinse or something like that will help you. And you might might laugh, but I Stacy makes me this little sav of of of uh of something and I just put it in the edges of my nose and I don't look pretty when I'm applying it, you know, but but uh you'd be surprised. It helps to form a barrier. And uh so we're we're serving a healer, &gt;&gt; but he has given us well he's given some of us common sense. How many of you are thankful for common sense? &gt;&gt; And the rest of you may have to buy yours, but uh God can grow it. I believe it. Let's turn in our Bible to uh Hebrews chapter 11 again. Guess what I'm going to preach on today? &gt;&gt; Samson. &gt;&gt; Uh that's all I know these days, but we're almost done, but not quite. I heard several comments this week. Some people said, "I'm I'm ready. I'm about ready to be through with Samson." I said, "You are?" And they said, "Yes. It's way too close to home." Well, then then we then we need to keep Samson around for another month or so if he's helping us. Uh somebody else said, "You know, well, actually several people mentioned this week, you sure read a lot of quotes uh last Sunday." And uh when I hear that, I it just makes me know I ought to read some more. &gt;&gt; Uh if it's good and it's the truth, &gt;&gt; we ought to hear it. &gt;&gt; And I think some people think they know what he preached, &gt;&gt; but they don't really know what he preached. &gt;&gt; And and so uh they ought to have to maybe hear it from all different angles. And that's what we try to do. But I'll try to be mindful of that in the future. Hebrews, uh 11:32. And what shall I more say? For the time would fail me to tell of Gideon, and of Barack, and of Samson, and of Jeepa, of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets, who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword. Out of weakness were &gt;&gt; made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight. The armies of the aliens. Women received their dead raised to life again. And others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a higher or better resurrection. and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yay, moreover, of bonds and imprisonment. They were stoned, they were saw a sunder, they were tempted, were slain with a sword. They wandered about in sheep skins and goat scans, being destitute, afflicted, tormented. &gt;&gt; I want to pause again and ask you, does anybody want to tell us how rough your week was? &gt;&gt; I don't think so. I don't think that most of us have been dealing with this kind of trouble. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They they they they were stoned, destitute. And look at verse 38. Of whom the world was not worthy. &gt;&gt; They wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth. AND THESE ALL ALL OF them a and the entire chapter before we started reading in verse 32 we call it the hall of faith because it lists all so many champions of God who by faith through faith accomplish so many powerful things. And yet the scripture ends, the chapter ends by saying, "And these all having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise." My goodness, have you ever let the impact of that strike you? They paid the price, the ultimate price, &gt;&gt; and yet they didn't receive the promise. And you're the reason. And I'm the reason &gt;&gt; because it says God having provided something, some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect. Without our testimony of overcoming power, they will never be perfected. But if you and I will press this thing and overcome the spirit of Leodysia, if we will overcome the spirit of the age, not only will we receive THE PROMISE, BUT ALL these listed in Hebrews 11 and the saints and BRIDE OF EVERY OTHER AGE will also come to their perfection. &gt;&gt; Why is that? Because God has laid it out. He's laid it out so beautifully for us in the older covenant and in the newer covenant. And he laid it out for us through history and seven church ages of history. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know that we are at the climax, at the culmination, at the consummation of the ages. We've got to make it. &gt;&gt; Somebody has TO SAY, "WE'VE GOT TO MAKE IT." And how are you going to make it? The same way the rest of them made it that far. By faith. Through faith. IN FAITH, WITH FAITH. &gt;&gt; AND WITHOUT FAITH, it is &gt;&gt; impossible. impossible to please God. Father, thank you so much for every visitor who is gathered here today. It warms our hearts. Thank you for letting us wake up with that beautiful white snow. We love to see it come and we rejoice to see it go. But it reminds us, oh God, of of what it looks like when our scarlet red dark sins, dark sins, black sins were washed with your scarlet blood and made us, as scripture says, white as snow. &gt;&gt; Lord, thank you for the cleansing power of grace and the blood. Meet us now at your word and we will give you praise and honor and glory. Bishma adonai Yeshua Hamashiach. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray. And the saint said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Judges chapter 16 is where we will go now. Also by now very familiar verses of scripture. We'll start in verse 23 and we will read all the way to verse 27. And then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Deeon their god. Remember Deeon, the god of the Philistines, part fish, part man. And uh there there's a beautiful rendition rendering of him. Can you imagine anything anybody worshiping that? It looks like a cartoon. has no power, no authority. It it is symbolized in idols. And when the ark of the covenant was placed in scripture in the in the place of worship where Deegon's major statue was kept, then he just broke off at the torso and bowed fell right over bowing to the God who was represented in that ark. So God already has power to defeat any other god with a little G, doesn't he? Remember it was it was in our scripture that it says uh that there is no god like unto thee among the gods. &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean there are other gods. It means there are other gods that are worshiped. &gt;&gt; Whatever an object of worship you have that can be your god. &gt;&gt; And I'm thankful that there's a one true living God. And we sung about him. I mean you sung about him this morning in worship. You really sung about him and you did it in spirit and in truth and you changed the atmosphere. I wouldn't I wouldn't be afraid to say you not only changed the atmosphere in this place, but I would say you shifted the atmosphere over the county because when we lift him up, when the praises of God go up, I know the authority of God, the government of God, and the blessings of God come down. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's worth any effort that you put forth to worship him. &gt;&gt; All the time. Not just in church, but all the time. For they said, "OUR GOD HATH DELIVERED SAMSON, our enemy, into our hand." And when THE PEOPLE SAW HIM, THEY PRAISED their God. For they said, "Our God hath delivered into our hands our enemy and the destroyer of our country." They were squatters then. &gt;&gt; And squatters now. &gt;&gt; It never was according to scripture their country. They just took it. &gt;&gt; And this enemy, this Samson slew many of us. And it came to pass when their hearts were merry that they call, THEY SAID, "CALL for Samson that he might make us sport." They wanted him to be entertainment for them. And they called for Samson out of the prison house and he made them sport and they set him between the pillars. Samson was blinded and now he is pushing and pulling the grinder to grind the grain which was considered a woman's work and they built prison houses. In fact, archaeology has discovered ruins of prison houses that were built specifically for that purpose. That the prisoners would be forced to grind the grain. Hundreds of them at a time, grinding the grain back and forth, pushing and pulling. And it must have been a humiliating task for someone who had been a judge in Israel for 20 years. Here he is doing woman's work in shackles behind bars held as a prisoner and blind. His eyesight, his vision was taken from him. And now they're pulling him into one of their festivals. 3,000 strong. They're gathered to make sport, to have entertainment, and to enjoy seeing a champion of Israel humbled, brought low. But I want to tell you again, like brother Cade was singing, uh, I DON'T KNOW WHO TOLD you that, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I don't know who told you that that uh, God is defeated. AND I DON'T KNOW WHO TOLD YOU THAT YOU CAN'T MAKE it through. AND I DON'T KNOW WHO TOLD THE PHILISTINES THAT they had won. But I know it wasn't over yet for you &gt;&gt; and it wasn't over YET FOR SAMSON. &gt;&gt; GOD WASN'T FINISHED WITH him yet. &gt;&gt; And so look at verse 26. And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, this little guide, this little servant boy that had been serving him, perhaps even in the prison, appointed to Samson to get him back and forth because he wasn't able to see and to guide himself. He said to this little lad, held him by the hand and and he said, "Suffer me THAT I MAY FEEL THE pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may rest, that I may lean upon them." Now the house was full of men and women, and all the lords of the Philistines were there. And there were upon the roof about 3,000 men and women that beheld while Samson made sport, while he entertained the crowd. We don't know what that looked like. Maybe it WAS JUST THE SIGHT of him that brought great celebration. Brother Vanom sort of uh dramatizes it. And I read lots of that to you last Sunday. And I don't want to I don't want to take as much time doing that today. But if you will allow me, I want to to uh revisit a couple places as we move forward in this today in the message in Hot Springs. Uh I I went back this week and and went through the entire sermon. Oh Lord, just once more, 1963, paragraph 51. He said, "And now as we sit here this afternoon, let's see if we can with imaginary mind place ourselves in that position to look at this scene." What do we see coming, moving out of the center of the arena? Come a little boy holding the hand of a blind man, stumbling, staggering along. They had many monkey shows and little tricks and so forth. But now has arrived the time for the main event. The thing that they had waited on so long, the main event of the day. The preliminaries over the halls ECHOED ALL AFTERNOON WITH DRUNKEN REVALRY. For they were celebrating victory over Deon, their fish god. And over the ark, now you're getting a little personal. the ark of the testimony because that was the representation of the promise of Jehovah. Look at there. He does have a name. &gt;&gt; Now in paragraph 54, THE LAD MUST HAVE DRUGG along the there stumbling this great mass of human flesh. both eyes out, hair hanging down his back, tithed and bound to make entertainment for a drunken, BRAWLING BUNCH OF UNBELIEVERS. HE MUST HAVE STUMBLED TO THE POST TO WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO make fun start from. When I think of that, I THINK ABOUT A CHURCH, LISTEN, THAT WAS ORDAINED OF GOD TO DO SOMETHING FOR GOD AND IT SUFFERED THE ENEMY TO BLIND his eyes from the word. Listen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; From the word you you SEE IN INSTEAD OF THE word we get a church creed. Instead of the word, we get an apostles creed or a nasine creed or we get a Hail Mary &gt;&gt; or EVEN AS THE CATHOLICS CALL IT AN OUR FATHER. &gt;&gt; We we get some SUBSTITUTION BECAUSE OUR EYES ARE BLINDED TO THE reality of the word. And here is the comparison being drawn for us. Uh in in paragraph 55, I was going to start with A CHURCH THAT OUGHT TO BE shining in the power and the strength of the Lord. What a disgrace. Yeah. &gt;&gt; 56. How humiliating it must have been for Samson with all of his framework made up that was more than able and had proved God had his strength through his framework and every muscle that HE EVER HAD STILL WAS IN HIS BODY. But but butlessings &gt;&gt; but the blessings of the Lord had left him. Your muscle won't do you any good. Your brain won't do you any good. YOUR JOB WON'T DO YOU. YOUR POSITION WON'T DO YOU. Your relationships won't do you any good IF THE BLESSINGS OF THE LORD are no longer upon your life. &gt;&gt; Without God's favor, we always fail. &gt;&gt; Without his blessing, we never prosper. &gt;&gt; In in 57 it says, "We may have all we may have all of our framework. We may have our denominational rituals. We may have our kids this and our youth that and our CAS and our missionets and our rangers and our come on right. &gt;&gt; We've got everything in place. We look like we've got it all together. We may have our names in the papers and on the ledgers, &gt;&gt; but I wonder today if the Pentecostal church, now remember, we're not preaching on the Baptist &gt;&gt; or the Methodist. &gt;&gt; WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SPIRITFILLED PEOPLE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO HAVE KNOWN THE power of the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; WHO'VE STAGGERED LIKE DRUNK MEN IN THE UPPER ROOM, WHO'VE PROPHESIED IN THE NAME OF THE LORD, WHO SPOKE IN TONGUES AND INTERPRETED TONGUES. &gt;&gt; FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY GOING FORTH AND THE NINE GIFTS OF THE SPIRIT IN OPERATION among them. That's who we're talking to. We're talking to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. WITH HIS EYES POKED OUT from the word of God and for the PURPOSE THAT JESUS DIED THAT WE TOGETHER COULD FELLOWSHIP AROUND THE WORD and the things of God. What a precious privilege it is. And now we're going to paragraph 101 for just a moment in New York, NEW YORK 63. BUT NOW HE STANDS HOPELESS, STRIPPED OF POWER. IT'S THE SAME THING NOW. THE CHURCH STANDS THE SAME WAY WHERE ONCE THE CHURCH USED to &gt;&gt; cast out devils. &gt;&gt; Make sure you're with me. &gt;&gt; Cast out devils. &gt;&gt; Now we entertain them. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Now we don't want to stir them up. &gt;&gt; Now we want to keep everybody calm. Now we're afraid of rubbing the devil the wrong way because we know he'll raise up his ugly head. Look, folk, he's going to do that anyway. You're not going to come to church in peace. &gt;&gt; He's going to do everything he can to harass you all the way here &gt;&gt; AND HALFWAY THROUGH THE SERVICE IF you let him. &gt;&gt; But I want you to know, you don't have to call on the preacher to get rid of him. &gt;&gt; You can if you want to. BUT HE SAID HE'S GIVEN YOU AS A BELIEVER &gt;&gt; all power, &gt;&gt; ALL AUTHORITY over the devil. &gt;&gt; You can tell him to go. You can tell him to be gone from your life. You can cast him out of your own mind. &gt;&gt; Anybody with me? &gt;&gt; They used to raise the dead. They used TO DO THINGS THAT JESUS DID. Sin could not dwell among them. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE THE HOLY GHOST WAS SO real in the house. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit came in and condemned it. And if a man done something secretly and belonged to this Christian group, AS SOON AS HE COME IN, the Holy Spirit revealed his sin and he either did what? &gt;&gt; He either repented or perished. But you see, we don't have it no more. &gt;&gt; Does that offend you? &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; Well, I hope you'll pay attention to it anyway. 102. And they won't receive it no more. And when it DOES COME, THEY TRY TO CALL IT AN EVIL SPIRIT. WHAT? &gt;&gt; WHEN THE HOLY GHOST SHOWS UP, &gt;&gt; WHEN THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD WOULD DESIRE TO MOVE AMONG THEM, WHEN SOME OLD GRANNY WOULD START GIVING AN UTTERANCE in tongue &gt;&gt; and some preacher, some deacon, SOME TRUSTEE, SOME ELDER, some something &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. WOULD RAISE UP AND CONDEMN IT AND CALL IT AN EVIL SPIRIT THAT THEY MIGHT RECEIVE that much more. &gt;&gt; Did you hear what he's saying? They're doing exactly what they are supposed to do. They're bringing more condemnation on themselves and those who follow them into the ditch. Does that sound too ugly for some? Oh, no. Not for me. I want it gunar straight. Something has to condemn them. Something has to condemn that kind of behavior. HE SAID, "NO, STRIP OF POWER." WHAT MUST HAVE WENT THROUGH THE MAN'S MIND? ONCE THAT KIND OF A WARRIOR AND NOW A LITTLE BOY, a novice, a newcomer has to lead HIM AROUND. WHY? HE'S BLIND. He can't see. He has nothing to see with. And here's what a prophet said. God have mercy upon us. The church is so denominated &gt;&gt; AND SO FAR AWAY TILL THE DEVIL HAS POKED OUT THE EYESIGHT, THE SPIRITUAL SIGHT THAT THIS IS THE word of God, not a creed. IT'S THE WORD AND GOD IS DUTY BOUND TO PRODUCE EVERYTHING THAT HE PROMISED in the Bible. &gt;&gt; WHEN FOR BIBLE DAYS ONLY? &gt;&gt; NO. HE IS THE SAME yesterday &gt;&gt; and today and forever. Amen. &gt;&gt; They they say, "BUT ISN'T THAT WHICH IS PERFECT? HASN'T THAT ALREADY COME?" YOU TELL me if there's perfect love ruling in the bride. YOU TELL ME IF YOU CAN FIND A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT ARE operating in perfect love because that's the context of that verse of scripture. To call it anything else, &gt;&gt; look out, brother Shelly, believe a will. &gt;&gt; To call it anything out is to take it out of context. Great. &gt;&gt; You know, UH, THE APOSTLE DIDN'T MAKE A MISTAKE WHEN HE'S WHEN HE'S, UH, WRITING THIS LETTER AND HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE GIFTS &gt;&gt; AND ALL OF A SUDDEN HE STARTS TALKING ABOUT LOVE. &gt;&gt; And then in a LITTLE WHILE, HE STARTS TALKING ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE SPIRIT AGAIN. WHY WOULD HE put love in the middle of it? BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THE TRUE GIFTS OF GOD can operate. &gt;&gt; They're not to operate in anything but love. They're not for private interpretation. We're not to use the nine gifts of the spirit as weapons against one another. &gt;&gt; We're supposed to let God come and have his wonderful way. And when perfect love is come, and we can say without a doubt that the headstone has been, not potentially so, NOT PROPHESIED SO, NOT PREACHED ABOUT SO, BUT WHEN WE SEE THAT IT HAS COME, that's &gt;&gt; right. And you know, we even know how it's GOING TO COME. AND ZACHCHARIAH THE PROPHET TELLS US HOW IT'S GOING TO COME. THAT CAPPING IS COMING WITH SHOUTS of &gt;&gt; grace. Grace. &gt;&gt; Sister Pam's not here this morning, but she had a birthday this week. And first, very gingerly, I sent her a little happy birthday text. And then I thought, "Oh, she's picked on me. I think I'll pick on her. And I said, I'm talking about Pam Tibo. And I said, "Grace, Grace." And I think uh maybe maybe I don't know if Luke or Megan was around because she sent me a question mark. And then all of a sudden, either they told her or it hit her. She said, "Oh." I said, "You know, you get it, don't you? Five is the number of grace. Grace. Grace is five and a five. Uhhuh. It'll happen to the rest of you too before it's over, right? It will happen. BUT THAT'S HOW THE CAPSTONE COMES. It comes in such an hour that that an average or normal portion of grace WILL NOT SEEM ENOUGH TO GET US THROUGH THE PRESS. AND SO IT HAS TO COME IN AN ATMOSPHERE in an hour where grace GRACE IS BEING SHOUTED, &gt;&gt; NOT ONLY PROCLAIMED, BUT PRAYED. GRACE. GRACE. We need it. &gt;&gt; WE DIDN'T JUST NEED IT TONIGHT. WE GOT SAVED. I NEEDED GRACE YESTERDAY AND THE DAY BEFORE AND I NEED IT TODAY. HELP ME. AND I'M GOING TO NEED IT TOMORROW AND THE NEXT DAY. AND GUESS WHAT? IT'S THERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; It's available. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Look at Zechariah's prophecy and you'll see what the condition will be like. not only spiritually but physically and naturally. You'll see the hour uh spoken about when that final capping is going to come. We know what it is. We heard the prophet of the Old Testament. We've had a message to restore and a message to prepare the bride of Christ. So, we know exactly what it looks like. We know how it will operate. We've seen the ministry of Jesus updated again. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; Same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; So, we know exactly how sons of God WILL BE, HOW THEY WILL MANIFEST, WHAT KIND OF MIRACLES AND SIGNS WILL FOLLOW THEM. &gt;&gt; I don't preach this kind of stuff all the time. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to major on a sign and a wonder and a miracle, but I want you to know I believe in them, &gt;&gt; and I believe you're going to need them until you're operating in perfect love. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "What about the right interpretation of the word?" Isn't that often how that verse was uh uh interpreted? And didn't even brother Brandon say some things like that? He may have, but today as a Berean, I'm going to put that quotation back in the word. &gt;&gt; Is that okay? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And if I TAKE THAT QUOTATION AND PUT IT BACK IN the word, I've got to PUT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF the word. &gt;&gt; And it's talking about divine love. when that divine love Oh my &gt;&gt; sir, &gt;&gt; when there's a people who've got above their uh their uh complexes, &gt;&gt; that's right, &gt;&gt; their tendencies, &gt;&gt; their predispositions, &gt;&gt; and they're operating in that divine love. &gt;&gt; Well, then in that hour, we won't need tongues and interpretation &gt;&gt; cuz love will win it all. &gt;&gt; Love will conquer it all. Love will deliver us from all. Somebody said, "That's kind of strange." I'm just telling you what Paul said. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; And if that last church age of messenger, if he had a message that was anything different than the first church age messenger, he told us, "Well, you better you better stay with the word." &gt;&gt; That's exactly what we will do. JUST A MINUTE. AMEN, PASTOR. &gt;&gt; Thank you for telling it just like it is. Oh, you're welcome, folks. See how that goes? That's how that happens. All right, let's go on. UH THEY SAY WELL WE BELIEVE YOU HAVEN'T GOT NO BELIEF COMING IF IT'S CONTRARY TO THIS THE MIND of Christ in you &gt;&gt; YOU BELIEVE THE THINGS THAT CHRIST WROTE CUZ THIS IS CHRIST THE WORD but look at the condition look at the parallel when we see that what must have went through his mind Samson let's see what went through his mind we see that went through the warlord's mind of the fear. Just a moment. I I uh I wanted to finish out with 104 and 109. That's that's why I reposted those put them in the new notes. So, I'm skipping to 109. I'll try to catch myself. I took them out so that I wouldn't be tempted to reread them uh to you again. It ought to be a shame. Hold on now. It gets a little tough here for just a minute. It'll be quick. &gt;&gt; It'll be quick. Go ahead and spray some numbing on it now because here it comes. It ought to be a shame to a minister that will SIT AND READ THE BIBLE then walk out before the people. The world is full of lots. &gt;&gt; Lot turned back, didn't he? &gt;&gt; Lot chose the world instead of the truth. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said the Bible said that the sins of Sodom &gt;&gt; vexed his righteous soul, but he didn't have the courage &gt;&gt; to stand up and rebuke that sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and you know, besides that, grandma's buried in the backyard. &gt;&gt; So, we could never change churches. Right. &gt;&gt; But we're going to have to have a determination in the last of the last days &gt;&gt; to stand on the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean stand on it with everything that we have. &gt;&gt; It has it can't just be a part of why we live. It needs to be the reason why we live. &gt;&gt; And there is many men today. He says, and I say this with reverence only with love, but just to say truth, we may never meet again. He said, "Let me get it out here. I may never have this chance again. There's many a man that reads this same Bible that we read, sits in his office preparing his message and run upon these truths of God because they're right in the Bible. &gt;&gt; And have to bypass them. &gt;&gt; Hello. He'd be afraid to preach against women cutting their hair. HIS ORGANIZATION WOULD TURN HIM OUT, &gt;&gt; even though they all used to have that as a doctrine. &gt;&gt; His organization would turn him out. I told you you needed some numbing. &gt;&gt; And about wearing immoral clothes and committing spiritual adultery. They all used to preach against it. And about men that WOULD TAKE THEIR SOCIABLE DRINK ON CHRISTMAS AND gets out and has a little clean American fun telling dirty jokes. &gt;&gt; Still maintaining HIS OFFICE AS A DEACON. &gt;&gt; It's worse than that. They stand out the front door and smoke their cigarette &gt;&gt; AND COME INSIDE AND DO THE DEACONING. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; You have my permission not to listen to a deacon that would do such a thing as that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's got to be an example. &gt;&gt; They know them THINGS ARE WRONG, BUT THEY'RE AS IT WAS IN THE DAYS OF LOT. &gt;&gt; We're back to that sinful place again. SEE? OH, HOW SAMSON MUST HAVE BEEN REMINDED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT HOW HE HAD FAILED GOD'S PEOPLE and failed God himself. Now he's a prisoner. Now he is a prisoner. Now he is a prisoner of the very thing that God raised him up and gave him power. &gt;&gt; To destroy. &gt;&gt; Now he's a slave to it. &gt;&gt; You had an opportunity to kill it. You had an opportunity to dig it out by the root. You had an opportunity to walk in deliverance from it, but you wouldn't deal with it and you wouldn't do anything about it. And now, brother Random said, "It has taken you captive." &gt;&gt; Samson wasting his time. Uh this uh well, I don't know what to say. You know, when when passion and sexuality is more important than the vow you make to God, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; It's going to put your head in the wrong person's lap. &gt;&gt; You're going to lose your power. All right. &gt;&gt; You're also going to create a soul tie. &gt;&gt; That's going to harass you the rest of your life if you don't get deliverance from it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Better listen. &gt;&gt; It'll bind you. When you give yourself away to someone you're not married to, you're binding yourself. &gt;&gt; You knew when you laid down with her, you wasn't going to have her tomorrow. You knew you wasn't going to live with her. You knew you weren't even going to build a relationship with her. &gt;&gt; She was a cheap thrill. &gt;&gt; But what you didn't understand was you created a connection &gt;&gt; because that intimacy is reserved. Is that too rough for 2026? Because that intimacy is reserved &gt;&gt; for the confines and boundaries of marriage. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when PEOPLE STEP BEYOND THAT, they're creating soul ties &gt;&gt; that that a marriage won't break. &gt;&gt; You've got to have some authority. You've got to find a place of authority to begin to deal with that kind of thing &gt;&gt; or that name will come up or that picture will come up or that memory will come up and harass you &gt;&gt; the rest of your life. and we have nobody to blame but ourselves. We should do what we know to do. &gt;&gt; There's strength for us. &gt;&gt; And and let me also say there's forgiveness for us &gt;&gt; if we don't. &gt;&gt; I don't want anyone to leave here condemned. But I want you to know it's not as innocent as the world would have you to think. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nobody else but no. Somebody Somebody say only Only the two of us know. You're so wrong. &gt;&gt; You're so wrong. The one who sees all and knows all. &gt;&gt; Amen. He knows. &gt;&gt; It's a hindrance. I tell you, in the church today, it's a big old hindrance. JUST READ THE NEWS. OH, HE MUST HAVE BEEN REMINDED. NOW HE'S A PRISONER OF THE VERY THING THAT GOD RAISED HIM UP and gave him power to destroy. I want to say another thing. You stray from your marriage vow. You're walking on very dangerous ground. &gt;&gt; You may think you're getting by, &gt;&gt; but God's liable to send a bird to tell on you. &gt;&gt; Listen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got children to think about. &gt;&gt; You've got a lovely wife to think about. If she's no longer lovely, it's what you've done to her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Living with you and ugly anybody. &gt;&gt; I'm just telling it like it is. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Let's go on. &gt;&gt; I'm a member. I'm in THIS WITH YOU. NOT A MEMBER OF AN ORGANIZATION. GOD FORBID. HE SAID, "BUT I'M A MEMBER BY GRACE IN THE BODY OF CHRIST. I'M YOUR BROTHER. I HAVE NO SELFISH MOTIVE. MY MOTIVE TO ACHIEVE ANYTHING PERSONALLY. I AM ONLY ZEALOUS &gt;&gt; ZEALOUS &gt;&gt; for the Lord God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I say this with all my heart. I'll tell you, I appreciate somebody who would say it then and I appreciate somebody who would say it now. &gt;&gt; The very thing that you were called out of, you're gone back into it again. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's rough talk. And as the Bible said, as the S goes to her wallow and a dog returns to its vomit, and listen, he said, IF THE VOMIT MADE THE DOG sick in the first place, won't it make him even sicker the second time? &gt;&gt; You tell me. &gt;&gt; Help us. &gt;&gt; And if some of you are secondg guessing the weekend you came, huh? Maybe maybe some of you thought the weather was going to hold you up and now you're wishing it had of. If if organization and create that little bit of snow laying at the end of your driveway could have easily kept some of you from church, but I'm glad that you didn't let it &gt;&gt; because you needed to be here. God had an appointment with you here. &gt;&gt; He We're not through yet. &gt;&gt; He said, or if organization and creeds that had GOT THE PEOPLE SO BOUND UP AND GOD CALLED YOU OUT TO BE A FREE PEOPLE AND YOU TURNED RIGHT BACK AROUND and done the same THING AGAIN, HE SAID IT'S A GREATER SIN. Now they had him doing tricks. THE CHAMPION OF THE LORD &gt;&gt; SLAYED A THOUSAND MEN WITH A JAWBONE OF A DONKEY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU know I didn't want to say donkey, don't you? &gt;&gt; But I did for you. SLAY A THOUSAND MEN WITH A jawbone of a donkey. TOOK THE GATES OF GAZA, COME WALKING DOWN THE HILL WITH HIM. He knew the power, the supernatural POWER OF GOD. AND NOW HE'S BLINDED AND TIED UP LIKE A PRISONER, LOCKED IN A PRISON DOING WOMEN'S WORK, slave work, REALLY. AND THEN NOW HE'S PARADED AROUND LIKE SOME KIND OF exhibit &gt;&gt; in a circus. Oh, he must HAVE THOUGHT. HE MUST HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT WHEN HE WAS STANDING THERE WHAT IT FELT LIKE. REMEMBER IN THAT FINAL MOMENT THAT HE TOLD THE SECRET AND DELILAH had his hair SHAVED OFF AND HE HE SHE SCREAMED. SOMEBODY SCREAM, "THE PHILISTINES ARE UPON THEE AGAIN." And he raises up. He thought, "It'll be just like the next time. The last time. I mean, it'll be just like the last time." and he shook himself and he waited on the on that mighty raw power of God to seize him like it had all those other times. And this time there was nothing. Not a whistle, not a whisper, not a goosebump, not one single hair on his body stood up. &gt;&gt; And all he could all the scripture can tell us about his moment was he wished not. He wished not that the spirit of the Lord had departed from him. You know, I want to give Samson some credit today. The Bible did. I just read about him in the in the in the hall of faith &gt;&gt; in the hall of faithfilled champions. His name is there. &gt;&gt; Have you failed God? Don't worry. He can redeem his purpose in you. &gt;&gt; He can transfer you out of the gutter of your own self-will and place you in the hall of faith. If you'll recognize, I WANT TO GIVE SAMSON CREDIT RIGHT NOW FOR EVEN RECOGNIZING THAT THE SPIRIT OF GOD HAD LEFT THE BUILDING &gt;&gt; BECAUSE COUNTLESS PEOPLE MEET WEEK AFTER WEEK AFTER WEEK AFTER WEEK DOING THE SAME TRICKS, &gt;&gt; GOING THROUGH THE SAME MOTIONS, &gt;&gt; NOT DISCERNING &gt;&gt; THAT THE SPIRIT OF GOD HAS LEFT THE BUILDING, &gt;&gt; THAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN OVER THE JUST QUOTING the word &gt;&gt; and they don't even know the difference &gt;&gt; because they can still get excited with the song and lovely singing and all the good things they enjoy so much. I I want to give Sam Samson some credit. He realized when he shook himself, whoa, &gt;&gt; that don't feel like it did the last time. And the last time and the last time, &gt;&gt; Samson, you you've got a price to pay. &gt;&gt; You gave your secret away. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the enemy has taken advantage. Sometimes we ought to shut up. Really? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; WE DO SO MUCH COMPLAINING UNTIL THE devil knows what bothers us the most. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Cuz we talk it, talk it, talk it, talk it, talk. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Just a minute. I'm baptizing myself. &gt;&gt; Evidently, I can't talk and drink at the same time. Now, let me bathe. Clean up. Now, use a towel. Now this mighty champion is doing tricks to entertain them. And that's just about listen. He said that's just about the way it's got. Oh my. Instead I can't hardly read it without feeling it. Instead of the Holy Spirit of a Holy Spirit. Give me just one minute. I I don't want to Yes. THAT WHEN SOMEONE RAISES up and gets arrogant, we have it sometime. THE HOLY SPIRIT IS OBLIGATED TO GOD TO SHUT that thing up. &gt;&gt; He said, "I've seen them pack them from the meeting." This is I didn't say this. I'm just reading, but I believe it. Paralyzed, blinded, dumb, and even die at the meeting, drop dead while they're TRYING TO REBUKE IT. GOD IN HEAVEN knows that's right. Many of you here have been in other meetings and witnessed the same thing. We read it in the book of Acts. &gt;&gt; Ananas and Safh judged by lying to the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; HE SAID THERE OUGHT TO BE A HOLY POWER SURROUNDING AND IN the church SURROUNDING THE CHURCH AND IN THE CHURCH THAT'LL MAKE DEMONS FLEE. Instead of that, it's become a &gt;&gt; it's become a place of entertainment. You see, I'm old enough to remember when the glory cloud when when the divine midst of the presence of the shakana, the shikina glory would come into those meetings. I've sat on the front bench like these ladies sitting here this morning and I've seen it become very very cloudy with my own eyes. I don't know which eye I was looking with. Uh I know I wiped my own eye and it didn't clear it up. So maybe it was a spiritual eye, but I've seen that glory cloud come in blue like grayish smoke come in and just hang between where I was sitting and the pull pit. And I knew that I was in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; I knew that the Lord was in the building. And I knew that anything I had need of, all I had to do was ask. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not the only Pentecostal. Who's ever seen anything like that? &gt;&gt; I grew up in an atmosphere where demons were cast out, where alcoholics were set free. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Anybody with me? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I grew up in a church out there on highway on the highway between uh here and and Callaway. And I remember the days when we would hear them 18-wheelers lock up their brakes as they flew down that highway. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Because they had slammed them on because they had seen something COMING OUT OF THE TOP OF THE church house. Many many times they would Are you saying many times? Yes, I'm saying many times. Multiple times it happened as a child. THEY SLAMMED ON BRAKES AND THEY COME BANKING IN THE BACK PARKING lot of that of that old honky tonk that had been made into a church. And we could hear the gravel as they come in and we could hear the scrub as they locked down. And that old back door would open up and a a big old I don't know why they were all big, but they were all big. &gt;&gt; Some big old truck driver would come staggering up the side aisle, make his way all the way to the altar. Didn't matter if they were singing, didn't matter they were preaching, DIDN'T MATTER WHAT THEY WERE DOING. MAKE HIS WAY DOWN. And that altar bench that was sitting here during the anniversary, I'VE SEEN THEM FALL AT THAT SAME ALTAR bench and give THEIR HEARTS TO GOD. AND WHEN THEY GOT UP, THEY'D SAY, "WELL, WHAT MADE YOU STOP?" WELL, IT WAS THAT FIREBALL HANGING over the church. OR THEY'D SAY, "IT WAS A FIREBALL hanging in the middle of the road." And we knew that it HAD TO BE AN INVITATION. It had to BE SOME SIGN OF GOD'S presence calling us back to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we're living in an hour where THE CHURCH HAS HAD TO TRY TO FIGURE A WAY TO TO SORT OF IMITATE, &gt;&gt; RIGHT, &gt;&gt; and counterfeit those things. &gt;&gt; You go into an average charismatic church ON A SUNDAY MORNING, SUNDAY NIGHT, THEY TURN OFF ALL THE LIGHTS. &gt;&gt; I was called to preach in a church in Ohio. My wife went with me some years back, little country church, and turned off all the lights. said, "We're going to see just how like the worldly churches they could be." They turned off all the lights. I got up, went to the pastor and said, "If you don't turn the lights back on, I'm leaving." &gt;&gt; He said, "You haven't even preached yet." And I said, "I won't be preaching. I didn't come to sit here in a nightclub. I came here TO GIVE THE WORD OF THE LORD, AND IF YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED in it, it won't be any hard feelings." &gt;&gt; But I'm not going to sit here like that. It's an atmosphere of entertainment. We didn't come to be entertained. Amen. &gt;&gt; We didn't come to watch a smoke machine &gt;&gt; counterfeit what I saw genuine. &gt;&gt; DID YOU NOT UNDERSTAND WHERE THEY GOT THE IDEA? &gt;&gt; It either COME FROM THE ROCK CONCERT or it CAME FROM AN IMITATION OR COUNTERFEIT of what the old-timers USED TO TALK ABOUT. &gt;&gt; WE DIDN'T NEED strobe lights. No, &gt;&gt; NO, SIR. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE SAW MANY TIMES THAT AMBER LIGHT &gt;&gt; moving around the building. THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM TODAY THAT HAVE SEEN IT. &gt;&gt; There were teenagers in THE CHURCH HOUSE IN COLUMBUS. THERE WERE TEENAGERS BAPTIZED WITH THE HOLY GHOST AS THEY STOOD UNDER A PILLAR OF FIRE THAT HUNG VISIBLY IN THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; PREACH. SO, IT HASN'T BEEN MANY GENERATIONS AGO. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; HE'S STILL GONE. SOMEBODY SAID, "DO WE NEED TO SEE SMOKE?" NO. Do we HAVE TO SEE FLASHING LIGHTS? NO. IS ALL THAT NECESSARY? NO. But it would be all right &gt;&gt; if the atmosphere was right &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT WAS IN THAT ATMOSPHERE THAT WE SAW DEMONS cast out and cancerous TUMORS FALL OUT AND BLINDED EYES OPEN AND BROKEN BACKS HEALED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE IF THERE'S A LIGHT OR A MIST OR A SMELL OR ANY OF THAT. BUT I DO CARE IF JESUS IS NOT SHOWING UP. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND PROVING HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That responsibility doesn't all fall on the pulpit. &gt;&gt; It does not. &gt;&gt; It falls on a body. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; To create an atma. And we we've done it many times. Nobody around here needs to be taught how. &gt;&gt; We know how to do it. Come on. &gt;&gt; We've just got to make sure that we hunger, we thirst, we cry out for it because we've got to have him. We've got to have him. Let's go back to where we were. There ought to BE A HOLY POWER surrounding in the church that will MAKE DEMONS FLEE. INSTEAD OF THAT, IT'S BECOMING A LAUGHING STOCK. WHAT IS IT? THE mechanics instead of and he says that a little differently. He usually explains the mechanics and explains the dynamics and he says to us the mechanics do don't do much good without the dynamic. You can have a brand new shiny motor, brand new transmission, plenty of brand new spark plugs and ignition AND FULL OF GAS and but YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE SOMETHING ELSE &gt;&gt; TO MAKE THAT THING GO. YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE NOT JUST MECHANICS IN PLACE. YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT'LL carry that spark &gt;&gt; TO THE FUEL. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE ALSO GOT TO HAVE THE DYNAMICS. AND HERE HE SAID THE MECHANICS SETTLING FOR THE MECHANICS instead of &gt;&gt; I'm my are you here? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I'm so glad you are. I'd rather you be here than anywhere else. Thank you for being here. Somebody said, "WHERE DO YOU GET THAT FROM?" MARK 16:es 15-18. And he said unto them, "Go ye into all THE WORLD AND PREACH THE GOSPEL to every creature." Now, if you read the footnotes in a Scoffield Bible that he wrote after he got out of prison, you might find that little place where he says CI Scofield where he says, you know, this this may not be inspired. Well, that's because he was a sensationist. He wanted to prepare a way to teach that miracles were passed and the healing, divine healing, even all those signs and wonders THAT WE READ ABOUT IN THE BIBLE. He wanted to prepare the people to believe that they had finished. Sounds like some modern message people I know today. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Maybe they've been reading the footnotes in the Scoffield Bible more than they've been hearing what the prophet said. &gt;&gt; You think it's Are we just being real today? &gt;&gt; I came here to be real. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is Brother Brent's birthday today. And he didn't come here for for a flowery birthday message full of compromise. How do you know? Cuz I know him. He wanted the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. SO IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, IT'S HIS birthday present anyhow. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; THERE HE IS. HALLELUJAH. GO INTO ALL THE WORLD, PREACH THE GOSPEL TO EVERY CREATURE. HE THAT BELIEVETH IS BAPTIZED SHALL BE SAVED. BUT HE THAT BELIEVETH NOT, &gt;&gt; OH, not a God of love and mercy, not a God who cares, not a Surely, surely, surely, in an AGE WHERE ULTIMATE RECONCILIATION IS PREACHED IN MANY PLACES, THAT EVERYBODY'S going to be saved in the end, that hell is going to empty itself out, and those who have spent some time in hell are coming out of hell to receive salvation and have eternal life. No, sir. &gt;&gt; No, sir. That's not the truth. That's not the Bible. As a tree falls, it lies there just like that. You don't have an opportunity after death. &gt;&gt; You've got an opportunity now to be born again of the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; And these signs, &gt;&gt; shall follow them &gt;&gt; that believe. Well, they're not following me. Then believe in my name. Shall they &gt;&gt; cast out devils. But now when the when the last message comes, they won't have any more tongues among them. THAT'S NOT WHAT IT SAYS HERE. &gt;&gt; IT SAYS THEY SHALL SPEAK &gt;&gt; WITH NEW TONGUES. THEY SHALL TAKE UP SERPENTS. I don't think that means we go gather them up. &gt;&gt; If you go gather them with your hand, then we'll see what we might do with them, you know. But I don't think anybody wants to do such a thing as that. That would be tempting the Lord. But if you, like the apostle, should gather firewood and a viper latch on to you, I have to believe. I can't help myself. &gt;&gt; I have to believe that if God did it for the apostle, &gt;&gt; I have to believe he's able to do it for me. &gt;&gt; And they just shook it off. Now there was a purpose in that &gt;&gt; because among those people on that island, they believed that there would come mighty men who would have power that would would be higher and it would supersede the power of the of any demon of any enemy to harm them. And specifically they had this idea that that vipers po because there were many on the island and they were taking many people out. But they believed in their tradition that there would be men who would come who would have power who would exercise power over those serpents. And God knew exactly what he was doing. He sent the right man &gt;&gt; at the right time &gt;&gt; and instead of panicking it just shook it off in the fire. If you ever find yourself in that kind of a position, you may absolutely see the same result. But I don't think you ought to be tempting the Lord. &gt;&gt; I know some of the mountain people have have took up the serpent and it's a very fascinating thing from a distance. Kind of like Wendy Bagwell. You remember Wendy? How many of you remember Wendy? They got it got to a church like that and they were singing and and said they got to shouting and he said there they come out with them rattlesnakes and he looked at Geraldine and said she was pale as a ghost and was backing up against the wall and he said there was a woman took it up and and then threw it down on the ground put her barefoot on top of that thing's head and said that was about more than they could take and said one of them said she look around. LOOK AROUND here and see IF YOU CAN FIND THE BACK DOOR. WE CAN GO OUT. Why are you looking at me like I ought not to be telling jokes? That was on the Christian radio station. How many of you heard it? Couldn't be wrong to tell that. And so said, uh, is there a back door? AND AND SAID WENDY, NO. SAID, I'VE DONE LOOKED AND there ain't none. There ain't no back door. Said reckon where do they want one? SO I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT KIND. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about when YOU ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU NEED THE Lord's intervention. &gt;&gt; He's able. &gt;&gt; THEY SHALL LAY HANDS ON THE SICK. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm reading scripture now. &gt;&gt; And they shall recover. &gt;&gt; And then in Mark 16:19 and 20. So then after the Lord HAD SPOKEN UNTO THEM, he was received up into THE HEAVEN AND SAT ON THE RIGHT HAND OF POWER and authority, and they went forth and preached everywhere. The Lord, &gt;&gt; working with them, AND DOING WHAT? CONFIRMING THE WORD. &gt;&gt; PHOENIX, ARIZONA, same message. I'm moving on. Paragraph 24. I can just hear all the warriors around. All the ladies are beads and bracelets and fine jewels and so forth. I I left that one in there because he gets specific and so forth and SAID, "SO THIS IS SAMSON. THIS IS THE MIGHTY ONE THAT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT. THIS IS THE MAN THAT YOU SAID THE SPIRIT OF THE GREAT GODS LIVED IN. THIS IS THE MAN THAT COULD TAKE OVER OUR NATION THAT you talked about." But look at him now. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; I got a feeling the devils mock the church the same way. &gt;&gt; What an example. What a lesson it ought to BE TO US. WHAT A SOLEMN THING IT OUGHT TO BE. WE SHOULD NOT JUST APPROACH THIS AS JUST COME TOGETHER to have a good time in a celebration. WE'VE COME TOGETHER TO SEE WHERE WE ARE STANDING &gt;&gt; TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING TO US. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And I could hear Samson no doubt could hear from one side and the other one of people who'd heard about him, well this is so this is Samson. I wonder today if the enemy can also at this time say about the thing about our Pentecostal move, the same thing just to SPEAK THE NAME SAMSON. THEY'D ALL GET NERVOUS because he was anointed servant of God born with a Nazerite vow. And they knowed that there was nothing could stop that Nazerite gift as long as he held it. He was God's chosen man of the day. God's chosen messenger of the day. Many of them thought what this must be. Many of them remembered him. Many remembered as they looked at this helpless CREATURE STANDING THERE WITH HIS ARMS WRAPPED AROUND THE POST, BLIND, making fun of him, hitting him WITH WHIPS, SAYING, "COME ON OUT, SAMSON. YOU GREAT STRONG MAN. DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. YOU'RE SO STRONG. WHERE IS YOUR GOD?" I'M TELLING YOU, they were really mocking. Yes, sir. And then he said, "If that JUST ISN'T ABOUT THE SAME WAY THE ENEMY LIKES TO DO WHAT HE CAN GET YOU DOWN." &gt;&gt; BUT HE DARES TO TRY THAT AS LONG AS THE POWER of God is operating through the church. Listen, HE HE WOULD BE AFRAID TO DO THAT WHEN THE NAZERITE blessings are upon you. But he can see you whipped. That's when he makes fun of you. The devil. Oh yes. That's when he can say there's no difference between them and us. They're just same man like we are. But when there's something different, SOMETHING OUTSTANDING WITH JEHOVAH'S blessing on it, &gt;&gt; then they're scared to say anything. Long as they can see that POWER OF GOD WORKING, THE DEVIL'S GOT SENSE ENOUGH TO KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT. BUT WHEN HE KNOWS YOU'RE DEFEATED, &gt;&gt; BOY, that's good. He turns every devil he can &gt;&gt; loose on you. So here the champion stands. He can't even find the pillars to lean on. And here comes this little boy. This is just a small detail, but God burned this in my heart many years ago about 1991 or '92. He dropped an inspiration in my heart concerning this little boy. It's just a small detail just mentioned so briefly here. We don't even know his name. We don't even know Samson's mother's name either, by the way. &gt;&gt; But we know what an important role she played. This little boy, stay stay here just a moment. This little boy certainly played a small detail but with a great prophetic weight in this story. Scripture gives only one verse to the lad. But one verse, one verse changed the outcome. One verse made a difference &gt;&gt; in the future of an entire nation. There's no name, no title, no lineage, no record of his anointing, his calling, his God, his faith, his religion. NOBODY KNOWS. Yet without him, Samson never reaches the pillars. Without him, the Philistine system never collapses. Without him, the story ends in humiliation instead of deliverance. Without who? The lad. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "The lad." God often hides his greatest end time instruments prophetically in small verses. Now I want to talk about for a moment who the lad is and who he's not. What the lad is not. He is not strong. He is not famous. He is not a judge. He is not anointed like Samson. He is not the chosen deliverer to begin the deliverance of Israel from the hands of the Philistines. But let me tell you what he is. He is available. &gt;&gt; He is obedient. &gt;&gt; He is aligned. &gt;&gt; He's strategically placed. And he recognized something ABOUT SAMSON. BUT &gt;&gt; HE KNEW SOMEHOW THAT WHATEVER HAD HAPPENED TO COST HIM HIS POWER. &gt;&gt; THERE HAD BEEN A MEASURABLE CHANGE IN HIS DEMEANOR THESE LAST FEW WEEKS. &gt;&gt; AND THAT LITTLE BOY DIDN'T WANT TO MISS IT. &gt;&gt; I'm taking a little license. &gt;&gt; Forgive me. We all do. &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T WANT TO MISS IT. SO HE WENT WITH HIM FROM THE PRISON HOUSE TO THE TO THE PLACE OF CELEBRATION AND HE WAS JUST WAITING on on an instruction placed right beside him. GOD DOES NOT REQUIRE PROMINENCE TO POSITION SOMEONE PROPHETICALLY. ALL THAT IS NECESSARY TO BE POSITIONED PROPHETICALLY is obedience. This is a holy picture. of a remnant bride church in the last days. &gt;&gt; A remnant church is overlooked. It's underestimated. IT'S UNSELEELEBRATED. BUT IT'S divinely positioned. &gt;&gt; You see, the first thing they WANT TO KNOW, WHAT denomination are you? When we tell them we ain't got none, it gives away our hick our hickeyified selves, right? We don't have any. Not because we couldn't, BUT BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN THERE &gt;&gt; and done that. &gt;&gt; All we got was a t-shirt. &gt;&gt; We didn't get any closer to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. man's rules, man's restrictions, man's uh political moves and maneuvers and didn't do anything for us. &gt;&gt; And so we CAME TO A PLACE WHERE WE WOULD RATHER STAND ALONE ON THE word &gt;&gt; than in the crowd. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sanctioned by the mother church. &gt;&gt; But there was a generational partnership that was forming that's very very important prophetically for the season that we're about to enter into. So hear this. I've been holding it for this moment. THERE'S A GENERATIONAL partnership that God is setting up right here in this hour with a generation that has seemingly passed their prime. And a generation that is not yet stepped into the fullness of their why, the reason why they were born. And yet both generations represent something that we can't move forward without. &gt;&gt; We're stuck in history. We're doomed to repeat THE MISTAKES OF THE GENERATIONS BEFORE US. IF WE MISS this opportunity TO WATCH GOD FUSE TOGETHER THE WISDOM &gt;&gt; OF A GENERATION THAT CAME OUT UNDER MOSES &gt;&gt; AND A GENERATION THAT WILL GO IN. MY GOD, I felt that. Woo. &gt;&gt; It's not about feeling, but I'm glad I still got my feeler. &gt;&gt; Some people may have lost theirs. IS A GENERATION THAT HAS BEEN THERE AND DONE THAT. A GENERATION WHO HAD WISDOM, a generation who has experience, a Moses generation AND A JOSHUA GENERATION THAT'S JUST EMERGING. &gt;&gt; Some of US FEEL AS THOUGH WE'RE KIND OF CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE BETWEEN A MOSES GENERATION AND A JOSHUA GENERATION. I WANT DON'T WANT YOU TO SPEND one moment, forgive me for this lozenge. I DON'T WANT YOU TO SPEND ONE MOMENT WORRIED about am I of the older gen AM I OF THE MOSES GENERATION OR AM I OF the Joshua generation? BECAUSE REMEMBER JOSHUA HIMSELF was part of the Moses generation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Joshua and Caleb, &gt;&gt; 12 went in. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; 12 came out. THAT'S &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; 10 CAME out with gripes. &gt;&gt; Two came out with grapes. &gt;&gt; God said, "I'M GOING TO USE those men." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO USE A JOSHUA. I'M GOING TO USE EVEN A CALEB. &gt;&gt; THEY were of A DIFFERENT SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE OF AN OLDER GENERATION, BUT THEY WERE OF A DIFFERENT SPIRIT. IF GOD SAID I'M GOING TO HAVE A MOUNTAIN, CALEB SAID I'M GOING TO HAVE A MOUNTAIN. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE IF I'M 80. I DON'T CARE IF I'M 90. I DON'T CARE IF I'M 100. IF GOD SAID HE'S GOING TO GIVE ME A MOUNTAIN, I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE UNTIL I GET MY MOUNTAIN. &gt;&gt; So don't YOU WORRY ABOUT WHICH generation you're in. &gt;&gt; SERVE GOD. DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO HELP THE synergy &gt;&gt; that is forming BETWEEN A MOSES, A PEOPLE WHO CAME OUT UNDER A MOSES ministry and a people who will go in &gt;&gt; under a Joshua ministry. Now, Brother Brandham tells us in his own commission, I don't fully understand everything about it. I understand by my own experience with this ministry, BY WHAT I SAW, BY WHAT I've heard, by where I've been, by who I've met, by the testimonies that I have been privileged to hear from eyewitnesses of what God did a generation ago. I believe with all my heart that a message came like a Moses message to deliver a people out from under the influence of of Egypt and to get them out there. And I believe that there was a time that the model had to shift. &gt;&gt; It had to shift. And so God allowed Listen, do you believe, let me ask you first before I go into this and close after a while. Do you believe that God is able to keep his man from falling? I just want to ask you, if God's put his hand on a man or a woman, &gt;&gt; do you believe God's able to keep them from falling? &gt;&gt; So do I. Then why did Moses fall? Why did Moses fail? Why, when God told him to speak to the rock, did he go back to the old model? Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope you can hear this. It's not that GOD DIDN'T DO IT in the OLD MODEL. HE DID. HE TOLD HIM ONE TIME, "TAKE THAT STICK AND STRIKE THAT ROCK &gt;&gt; AND OUT OF THAT ROCK LIVING water is going to flow and feed the and and give give water to the people." 1 Corinthians 10 tells us they all ate THE SAME SPIRITUAL MEAT and all drank from THE SAME SPIRITUAL ROCK. DRINK. THEY DRANK THE SPIRITUAL WATER THAT FLOWED FROM A SPIRITUAL ROCK &gt;&gt; THAT FOLLOWED THEM. A ROCK. A ROCK THAT FOLLOWED THEM. &gt;&gt; You ever had a rock follow you? The children of Israel did. &gt;&gt; And that rock, Paul didn't mention the words. HE SAID, "AND THAT ROCK THAT FOLLOWED THEM &gt;&gt; WAS CHRIST." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; What that looked like, I DON'T KNOW. BUT I JUST AM I'M a literalist when it comes to scripture. AND IF THE BIBLE SAID A ROCK FOLLOWED THEM, &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; IF THE BIBLE SAID THAT GOD REPRESENTED CHRIST IN A ROCK THAT FOLLOWED THEM, THEN I believe God REPRESENTED HIMSELF IN A ROCK, CALLED IT CHRIST, AND IT FOLLOWED THEM. &gt;&gt; I JUST believe that what it looked like, I don't know. But what I DO KNOW IS WHEN HE STRUCK THAT ROCK, WATER CAME UP. Did you know there are archaeologists, some doubt it, but there are archaeologists, real archaeologists, not not phony baloney, &gt;&gt; Indiana Jones kind, but real kind, who believe that that rock has been found. I have pictures of it split right down the middle and they believe that that is the rock. I don't know. They believe God left that image there to I don't know. I wasn't there. But I know that when he struck the rock, guess what God told him to do? He did it. And God honored that. And I know that there should have been no water in that rock, but God placed it there. And it come down rushing down off that mountain and gave the people what they needed. &gt;&gt; There came another time that they needed water, and God told Moses to do what? &gt;&gt; Speak to the rock. But what did Mo are you still with me? Yes, sir. Is your uh Pop-Tart run out on you? Well, then you ought to have had something more than a Pop-Tart. You better hear this. We're just now getting to something. &gt;&gt; It's powerful for me. &gt;&gt; I'll just keep it to myself. That's okay. &gt;&gt; It blessed me enough So what did he do? He he he was frustrated. He'd had enough. God had given them everything they needed. He had followed those precious children provided. Did you know for 40 years they didn't need to go to Walmart and buy a new a new pair of pants? &gt;&gt; The Bible said for 40 years their clothes grew. I wish mom would have grudged with me all these years. I could have a big closet empty instead of 15 different sizes. My clothes didn't grow with me. They didn't shrink with me. If I ever shrunk a time or two, I did. But theirs grew with them. Their shoes never wore out. &gt;&gt; They didn't have Allen Edmonds in. And they they served them well because God was getting them from one point to the next. And yet they belly achd and they complained and they murmured against Moses. Come on. &gt;&gt; Mocked his choice of a wife. And on and on and on and on and on it went. AND GOD KEPT MEETING THEM. And God kept honoring them. AND ONE DAY GOD SAID, "MOSES, SPEAK TO THE ROCK. GOD WAS GETTING READY TO INTRODUCE A DIFFERENT MODEL. &gt;&gt; SAME GOD, SAME POWER, SAME RESULTS." &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; WATER from a rock. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. WATER FROM A ROCK. SAME RESULTS. Water from a rock, &gt;&gt; but a new model &gt;&gt; for how to get that water out of the rock. &gt;&gt; Why cry? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "WHY CRY? SPEAK TO THAT ROCK." And Moses had had all he could take. And all he could see was what looked like two-headed people to him. He looked out across that congregation and he had become so disappointed and so frustrated and so uh carnal. I'm not defending him. Although as a pastor, I want to I feel a little bit sorry for him. I pray I hadn't got that far. But instead, God said, "SPEAK TO THE ROCK." And it wasn't that Moses didn't believe God would do it, but he was stuck as as ordained to be stuck in the old model. And so he I know I he said, "I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS VEGAN, BUT I KNOW ABOUT THE STRIKING." &gt;&gt; SO HE STRUCK THE ROCK AND guess what happened? If I'd have wrote the book, I'd have said no water came. If it WOULD HAVE BEEN ME THAT DAY, I WOULD HAVE SAID, "NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, MOSES. I DON'T CARE HOW UPSET YOU ARE. I TOLD YOU TO SPEAK. NOW, you don't have to HAVE NO WATER, BUT THOSE PEOPLE ARE THIRSTY. NOW YOU DO WHAT I TELL YOU TO DO, AND you speak to that, and I'll feed all of you, and if there's any left, you can have a sip." That's how I'd have DONE IT. BUT GOD SAID, "NO, I'M NOT GOING TO EMBARRASS MY servant &gt;&gt; in front of those PEOPLE BECAUSE HE HAS PROVEN FAITHFUL AND HE HAS DONE WHAT I'VE CALLED HIM TO DO THESE many years. I'M GOING TO HONOR HIM BY LETTING WATER COME OUT OF THAT ROCK. BUT I'M GOING TO DEAL WITH him &gt;&gt; at another time." &gt;&gt; Did he? &gt;&gt; He took Moses up on the mountain, Nebo, wasn't it? And he said, 'I want you to look out over that land. That's the promised land. 40 long years you've wandered in the wilderness to get these people from here to there. Look how close it really was. You couldn't tell from down there in the valley how close you were. YOU WERE ALMOST THERE. BUT YOU DIDN'T OBEY ME, MOSES. AND BECAUSE OF THAT, I'M GOING TO LET YOU SEE IT. But you're not ever going to be able to walk in it. In fact, we don't know that he ever there there's great dispute over what even happened to his body. It's almost as though the Lord just somehow at some point just took him. Did was he lost? Never. Is he in eternity? Absolutely. Are you going to see Moses? Yes. And don't call him Santa Claus. Cuz he's not. Did he make it all the way? 100%. How did he do it? Because he was waiting in in paradise. The Bible talks about it. Do I need to repreach that? No. The Bible tells us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He goes down, his body laying in the grave. His spirit man goes down into the heart of the earth into that place that we understand to be called paradise where there's a gulix between it and Gehenna or hell and the righteous dead were in that place until Christ descended into the heart of the earth at his crucifixion. And as he made his appearance, they began to recognize &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM SAID, "HE LOOKS A WHOLE LOT LIKE THE ONE I'VE PAID TITHES TO." &gt;&gt; SHEDRACH, MACH, AND ABEDNEGO SAID, "LOOK THERE. HE LOOKS LIKE THE FOURTH MAN IN THE FIRE." &gt;&gt; DANIEL SAID, "OH MY, HE'S THE ONE THAT WALKED ALL AROUND THE LION'S DEN." ABRAHAM AND SARAH SAID, "WE KNOW HIM. HE VISITED US IN OUR TENT." &gt;&gt; AND DAVID SAID, "I SAW HIM IN THE MOUNTAINS OF JUDEA. &gt;&gt; I HEARD HIM TALK TO ME IN THE BABBLING BROOK. I FELT HIS EMBRACE WHEN I LAY IN THE GRASS &gt;&gt; OF PSALM 23." And on and on and on and on and on and on. And Moses said, "There he is the rock." THERE HE IS. THE ROCK THAT FOLLOWED US. &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE OF THAT, they accepted him to be what he said he was, Messiah, King, and Lord. &gt;&gt; And the Bible said that he led captivity captive. He took those who could not inherit an eternal kingdom beyond because they did not have the blood of Jesus applied to their life. And uh in spite of what you read, there is no one in that dimension with eternal life except those who have been redeemed by the blood of the lamb, by the grace of God and by the blood of the lamb. You won't meet one person there who is there with eternal life because they brought you uh something good. They were good to the bride. That's what they like to say. And they use this verse where Jesus said, "That that you've done under the least of my little ones, that you've done also to me." He said that and he meant it. &gt;&gt; And when you're good to somebody, WHEN YOU TREAT PEOPLE RIGHT, IT IS AS THOUGH YOU'RE treating God's people, YOU TREAT GOD'S PEOPLE RIGHT, IT IS AS THOUGH YOU'RE TREATING GOD RIGHT. NO PROBLEM. BUT THERE IS NO WAY THAT YOU CAN THEN BE GIVEN AS A REWARD ETERNAL LIFE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU'VE been good to a member of the bride. THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO MAKE IT. MOSES FOUND OUT. ABRAHAM FOUND OUT. DANIEL FOUND OUT. ADAM AND EVE FOUND OUT. &gt;&gt; AND there's going to be a whole lot of message folk find out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they had to come that same way you came. &gt;&gt; And boy, when they realized who he was, &gt;&gt; WOO. HAVE MERCY ON US. &gt;&gt; THOU SON OF DAVID, can you imagine David CRYING OUT, "HAVE MERCY ON US. THOU SON OF DAVID. OH, JUST THINK ABOUT IT, &gt;&gt; MY GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT HAVE MERCY. And he did. And he led them out of paradise. He emptied paradise. I'm still preaching. &gt;&gt; He emptied out paradise. And the Bible said he took them all the way out from the heart of the earth. And the and the Bible tells us in the New Testament that when that veil was rent and twained, the earth shook. And it said, "And many of the saints which slept arose and walked again the streets of Jerusalem." Amen. &gt;&gt; Wasn't just a resurrection of one man. &gt;&gt; It actually called a a a generational uh resurrection. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when he ascended, they could go with him. &gt;&gt; SO EVEN MOSES HAD TO COME BY THE BLOOD. &gt;&gt; AND ABRAHAM had to come by the blood. How could you possibly think that you could sneak in the back door? &gt;&gt; Oh my. Without the blood. uh they had to come up with such an idea because uh they wanted to narrow the whole salvation thing down and say the only way you can have eternal life is to believe a prophet or to name him a name or to understand a messenger to an age and that is contrary to the word. The Bible said uh whosoever whosoever calleth upon the name of the Lord &gt;&gt; shall be saved. &gt;&gt; You mean you can go to heaven without knowing who my pastor is? Yes. You mean you mean you can go to heaven without knowing who the last prophet and his name? Absolutely. It's saved. Call on the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Well, let God sort out whose bride and who's overcomer and who's not. But but I'll tell you, eternal life is eternal life. &gt;&gt; Anybody with me? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, here was Moses representing an old order. And here was a Joshua. But Joshua was a part of the same generation. And yet the ministry model of Moses WAS COMING TO AN END AND A NEW MINISTRY model was being introduced and THAT WOULD BE UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF JOSHUA. &gt;&gt; And I want you to look real quick WHAT GOD SAID BECAUSE THIS is a representation of the shift THAT RAISED A LITTLE lad to put Samson back in his position for one last great move of God. It's the bride's revival. Joshua 1:1. Now after the death of Moses, and I'll I'll just have to stop in a minute. Now after the death of Moses, a servant of the Lord, it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of Non. Moses minister, saying, Moses, my servant is dead. Now therefore arise and go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel. Every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon I have given unto you as I said. MOSES DIDN'T DO IT. BUT AS I SAID to Moses, for the wild from the wilderness and the Lebanon, even under the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and under the great sea, toward the going down of the sun, all the way west shall be your coast. There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days OF THY LIFE. AS I WAS with Moses, so I will be with thee. I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. Now, don't you go out of here thinking I'm preaching that there will be a one-man Joshua ministry. Absolutely not. That would be a repeat of the old model. &gt;&gt; The new model will not be a repeat OF THE OLD MODEL. THE NEW MODEL WILL BE A GENERATIONAL PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; A JOSHUA GENERATION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHO WILL WALK SOFTLY BEFORE THE LORD. AND IF HE SAID SPEAK TO THE ROCK, &gt;&gt; GUESS WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO? &gt;&gt; THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SPEAK TO THE ROCK. &gt;&gt; And they're going to get in a lot of trouble if all they do is go back through and try to figure out. Now, let's see how Moses did this. Let me let me see. Now, Moses said any gift ought to operate in a in a back room. and and Moses said that Moses said three three hymns and turn off the lights and and Moses said it. &gt;&gt; Some of you don't know where I am, but some of you do. &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean that we ignore the word that was delivered to us by Moses generation and Moses ministry. Absolutely not. Because he said you I'm going to be faithful to you, but you've got to stay faithful to what I said to Moses. &gt;&gt; Come on now. He said, "Thou shalt there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with thee. I will not fail thee, NOR FORSAKE THEE. BE STRONG &gt;&gt; AND OF A GOOD COURAGE." &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; Can I have 10 more? THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; GOOD COURAGE FOR UNTO THIS PEOPLE SHALT THOU DIVIDE FOR AN INHERITANCE the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them. Only be thou strong. You know what? God knew. God knew. God knew. God knew that it was going to be A BURDEN FOR JOSHUA to live under the reputation, &gt;&gt; under the expectation &gt;&gt; of a Moses ministry. &gt;&gt; And so he kept telling him, "I'll be with you. I'll never leave you. Be strong and be very courageous. Be strong. Be very courageous. Be strong. Cuz there's going to be some old-timers out there that'll try to crucify you &gt;&gt; or taking us anywhere, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They'd rather stay right here on this side of the Jordan, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Clinging to an old model, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; When God said, "Your inheritance is not on this side. &gt;&gt; Your inheritance is on that side." And you're going to have to have some power with God because when you get over there, you're going to meet the enemy, and you're going to have to dispossess him to inherit your promise. I DIDN'T CLEAR IT OUT for you. &gt;&gt; In order to get it and keep it and have it as your own, you're going to HAVE TO GET RID OF THE SQUATTERS. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee. Turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper whethersoever thou goest. See, some things are thus sayeth the Lord, and some things are the word of the Lord, and other things represent a ministry model. &gt;&gt; To think that everybody has to have an eagle belt buckle would be following a ministry model. &gt;&gt; To think that everybody has to like eagles would be following a ministry model. to think everybody has to live in Tucson or Jeffersonville &gt;&gt; would be following a ministry model &gt;&gt; that you don't have to keep that you don't have to follow but that word &gt;&gt; that word that you take back and lay in the absolute &gt;&gt; you're not worried about what Moses did or what his children did or what his wife did &gt;&gt; Africa &gt;&gt; or what he wore in Africa, right? &gt;&gt; Or whether he could count birds or not. That don't matter. You're not following that ministry model, but you're following that dovetail of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said that uh you say with that may observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee. turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whethersoever thou goest. Listen, this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein. For then thou shalt make thy way. Thou shalt MAKE THY WAY. THOU THOU SHALL MAKE THY WAY. HE DIDN'T SAY, I'M GOING TO MAKE IT PROSPEROUS. HE SAID, "YOU OBEY THE WORD AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE MAKING your way prosperous because you'll have the blessing and the favor of the LORD AND THEN THOU SHALT HAVE. Have not I commanded thee? Be strong." Here we go again. It wasn't that Joshua was a wimp. It was that God knew the challenge that lay ahead. And Joshua had been a follower and now he was going to have to be a leader. And it was going to cost him something because he was going to have to look as though he was fighting an old order to be able to shift the mindset for a new model. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I don't even know what you're It's a third pull model. &gt;&gt; It's a It's an entirely It's a third pull model. It comes by the authority of the spoken word. Yes. &gt;&gt; You see, I happen to believe that before we get out of here, there will be there will be a quick short period of time where we don't have to anoint with oil and lay hands on the sick and shake the heavens to believe. I have to believe that if this follows the pattern that the scripture has laid out for us that there will be an hour of authority just before the rapture of the bride and she will SPEAK &gt;&gt; AND IT WON'T JUST BE HER. IT'LL BE HER PAPA BACKING UP &gt;&gt; THE BRIDEGROOM, &gt;&gt; SPEAKING HIS VOICE THROUGH THE BRIDE, &gt;&gt; and not even cancer would be able to stand in the way of that voice. Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of good courage. Be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed, for the Lord thy God is with thee, whethersoever thou. Now, musicians are coming. I I didn't finish with a little lad, but I will. I I think I've I think I can squeeze out a few more on Samson. I THOUGHT YOU'D LEFT TO GO TO MOSES AND JOSHUA. OH, NO. I'm coming back. God talked to Moses. Let me give you these few paragraphs and be done. I didn't read as much as I did last Sunday, so don't murmur. Paragraph 23. Moses was a type of the church. Look, like I've said before, if I thought we were all hearing it like we needed to hear it or or reading it like we need to read it, well then I could just find something else to say. Moses was a type of the church. Listen carefully to this. Moses was a type of the church, a type of the organization, the law. But Moses glorified himself and instead of glorifying God as a perfect type. Now, somebody said, "I got a little problem with that." You can't. You can have a problem with that because that's exactly what happened. There was no sin involved in this. The glory just shifted. And God is jealous. Somebody said, "I can't believe you just said that." Oh, the Bible did. He's a jealous God. &gt;&gt; He wants our love and our obedience, and he wants our praise, and he he doesn't want us giving uh all of our praise and attention and confidence to men. He wants us to understand that men are part of that resurrection gift. Uh it said he he led captivity captive and did what? Gave gifts unto men. And those are the ascension gifts. And there are five of them. Apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, and evangelists. And there are nine gifts of the spirit in the book of first Corinthians. Nine gifts of the spirit and five ascension gifts. Apostle, pastor, you heard it. You know it. We can't forget it. So when Moses struck that rock, when God said speak to that rock, he wasn't setting the example that was going to be necessary to take those people all the way. And so this is what he tells us. There could have been a perfect type if he would have spoke to the rock. There could have been a perfect type. In other places, he tells us that by doing so, by doing what he did, by striking the rock the second time, he took the whole pattern of God out of Kater. &gt;&gt; You you educated folk understand what that means. It takes them out of cater. He said there was no need for Christ to be struck the second time. He died once &gt;&gt; for all. &gt;&gt; And by striking that rock the second time, it wasn't just Moses frustrated. But by doing that, he he broke the continuity of the program and pattern of God. God honored it. God gave the people water. Moses wasn't able to inherit the promised land. But don't you think for one minute that he lost his eternal purpose with God? But God is a jealous God. Just make sure I get all this out so that you don't misunderstand what I'm saying before they crossed over. Let me read it from the beginning since I botched it with all my commentary. Moses was a type of the church, a type of the organization, the law. But Moses glorified himself instead of glorifying God as a perfect type. He didn't mean to do that. THAT WASN'T WHY HE DID IT. HE WASN'T TRYING TO GET THE GLORY. BUT BY STRIKING THE ROCK WHEN THE PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE SOMETHING IS SHIFTING HERE THEY DIDN'T understand what it WAS ALL ABOUT BUT THEY MUST HAVE KNOWN SOMETHING WAS GOING SOMETHING FELT different this time and here he went right back and did it the same way and therefore he got the attention of the people and this was supposed to go only to God because it was going to be God's authority in the mouth of the prophet which would represent God's authority in the mouth of the bride &gt;&gt; that's part of mine and your pattern &gt;&gt; hello as a perfect type. I just did it again. Lord, please help me not to have commentary. Moses was a type of the church, a type of the organization, the law. But Moses glorified himself and instead of glorifying God as a perfect type before they crossed over into the promised land. And that's just exactly what Methodists, Baptist, Presbyterian, Pentecostals, Lutheran, and all all of us, all of us had done the same thing. They are seeing who can have the biggest crowd or the best dress or the biggest church or the finest pews. They're trying to glorify their organization until God moved out. &gt;&gt; And today, the very signs and wonders and phenomenals that's been in the church every time they had a revival through any age, these signs has broke out in the church. Hallelujah. So, Dr. Scoffield, you can take your commentary wherever you want to take it. But it must have been inspired because God's done it in every generation. He sent signs and wonders to follow the people of God. So it must have been inspired after all, sir. And they've been all down through all these church ages just like Joshua come with Moses all the way through. He wasn't he wasn't somebody that just stepped on the scene. He came all the way through under the ministry model of Moses. BUT THE CHURCH AIN'T CEASED with Moses. And Joshua took the children of God into the promised land, which tells me that the ministry model had to shift for the Israelites, for the bride, we're saying, to inherit the promise. So God didn't make a mistake and no drunk driver took Moses. No drunk driver took the prophet. and and and Moses you didn't die lost in the wilderness and it was all part of the plan and I believe that that age has come now the miraculous the phenomenal the baptism of the spirit and power and signs and wonders this great pouring out of God's spirit in the last days and that's a thing that'll bring faith into the people that'll take a rapturing faith that'll take the church into GLORY I BELIEVE IT HERE I BELIEVE IT TOO BUT THAT WAS 60 YEARS AGO AMEN. &gt;&gt; 60 years ago. &gt;&gt; I'M TALKING ABOUT HIS MINISTRY. I WAS LOOKING AT THE DATE OF THIS SERMON. That would be many more. If 65 WAS THE END OF HIS MINISTRY, THEN WE LOOK BACK AT THAT AND WE SAY, "WHERE IS THE RAPTURING?" OH, WE'VE GOT IT. WE'VE GOT IT. YOU SAY, "WE'VE GOT THE RAPTURING FAITH." OH, WE HAVE THE RAPTURING FAITH. THEN WHAT ARE WE STILL DOING HERE LIVING IN SATAN'S EDEN? &gt;&gt; IF WE HAVE THE FAITH TO MAKE A RAPTURE, WHY HADN'T SOMEBODY MADE ONE ALREADY? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there's a pattern and a program that's that's in this book, and we're not going to bend it. Moses couldn't bend it. &gt;&gt; THE PENTECOSTALS COULDN'T BEND IT. &gt;&gt; THE CATHOLICS COULDN'T BEND IT. AND WE'LL not be able to bend it either. We're going to have to follow the program all the way through. How can the church be raptured when we haven't even got FAITH FOR HEALING? THERE WAS FAITH FOR HEALING IN THE 50S AND 60S. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE RESTORATION MESSAGE CAME, RESTORED FAITH FOR HEALING, AND WHERE IS IT now 60 years later? Oh, they've got one little favorite quote. And the bride is just laying ripening in the presence of the sun. Nobody's buying it. There's got to be more. God has to finish his plan. There's no order in this word that says there's going to be a crippled, broken down, defeated, powerless, blind, &gt;&gt; baldheaded &gt;&gt; church like Samson. &gt;&gt; Forgive me, folks. Forgive me. Forgive me, BROTHERS. &gt;&gt; IN THE LAST DAYS, &gt;&gt; THERE'S AN order here. &gt;&gt; There's got to be then. THEN WHAT DO WE HAVE TO HAVE? WE HAVE TO HAVE A BREATH. WE HAVE TO HAVE A BREATH OF GOD'S WIND. AND THERE'S A FEW OTHER THINGS THAT WE'VE GOT TO GRAB A HOLD OF AND UNDERSTAND BY REVELATION BECAUSE THE JOSHUA MINISTRY CANNOT OPERATE UNDER THE ORDER OF A THIRD PULL WHEN WE DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND ALL THAT WAS REPRESENTED IN THAT THIRD POOL. &gt;&gt; AND WE CAN'T HAVE WHAT WAS RELEASED IN THOSE SEALS UNTIL WE HAVE UNDERSTANDING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND DON'T TELL ME IT WAS JUST VIRTUES BECAUSE IF THE THUNDERS WERE ONLY ABOUT THE VIRTUES, WE GOT THEM IN THE CHURCH AGES. THE RAPTURE COULD HAVE HAPPENED IN THE 50S. &gt;&gt; But here we are. &gt;&gt; 2026. I know some of you are lost. I don't like to do that when there may be a visitor that doesn't know all that we're referring to. That's why I'm done. But I just need to tell those of you who do know and who have been following this plan of thought for so many years now, something third seal message. He said, "The bride has never had a revival yet. &gt;&gt; It's going to take something to wake her up. It's going to take the revelation of those seven unknown thunders." All right, brother Jackson says that's seven men. Where are they? Let's get them here. All the seven men he picked in the 50s are dead. 60S DEAD. 70S ARE DEAD. SO, WE CAN'T WAIT ON THEM ANYMORE. And if IT WAS JUST THE VIRTUES, AS BROTHER COLEMAN PREACHED ALL OVER THE WORLD, HE'S GONE NOW. AND WHY DID GOD HAVE TO DO THE THUNDER? RELEASE THE THE THE THE UH VIRTUES IN THE THUNDERS when they had already been brought forth. We've got to make a little sense here. Let's go on. How can the church be raptured? We haven't got faith for healing. We've got to have rapturing faith first. How the how that God moves by his spirit, signs and wonders. &gt;&gt; He's talking about rapturing faith and signs and wonders. Isn't that crazy? Because they're putting signs and wonders so far back that they're ought to be over by now and rapturing faith out here. But he puts them right there together. How that God moves by his spirit. Signs and wonders begin to follow. Everywhere God begins to move, signs and wonders does what? &gt;&gt; Follow. &gt;&gt; Follows God. So if God's moving, there's going to be something to vindicate it. &gt;&gt; The world has always stood off and criticized it. Who is that little boy? Can you imagine that day? WHO IS THAT KID? HE'S GOING TO GET HURT DOWN THERE. WHAT IS HE DOING LEADING THAT THAT ENEMY AROUND? I DON'T CARE IF HE DOES STUMBLE AND FALL. THEY MIGHT HAVE SAID IT. I DON'T CARE IF HE DOES CRACK HIS HEAD OPEN ON THE ROCK THAT OLD SAMSON. WE USED TO TREMBLE WHEN WE HEARD HIS NAME, BUT LOOK AT HIM NOW AND AND GET THAT LITTLE BOY OUT OF THE WAY. He don't know nothing. They certainly wouldn't have understood what you and I are to understand. And that is he was playing a pivotal role. It was representing the generational shift between a Moses ministry model and a Joshua ministry model. They didn't have any idea that day that there was something being played out for them. And they didn't understand. And the remnant has never been understood. They weren't understood in any of the church ages or any of the gaps between the church ages. And there's going to be a remnant in this hour that will not be understood &gt;&gt; by her own. &gt;&gt; But she's going to hear what what the commission was and stay with the word. &gt;&gt; You're still here? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. The world stood off and criticized it from Adam down. They've done it every time. It's nothing new today that you should be criticized for the accepting Christ. Be ready now. Uh Benjamin and musicians. I know I threaten all the time and you think I'm I'm threatening again, but I'm I'm closing up here. I'm packing up. I'm walking to my seat. Now if you accept it in some fanaticism or persecuted for the wrong thing, you deserve it. But now look, if you have really God working with you, proving himself by Bible evidence of signs and wonders. Then you rejoice and be exceedingly glad for great is your reward in heaven. Moses, last paragraph, Moses in his journey bringing the children of Israel, God gave him a promise. Now, as God led that in the natural, so is he leading the church today in the spiritual. Now, they were going to a promised land out of a chaos. into a promised land. You just look around you from the ridiculous to the sublime. Thank you, Jesus. From chaos to clarity, from Babel's confusion to the peace. Oh, of the promise. This Joshua generation will be a humble remnant. She will not walk in bride pride, but will be dressed in the righteous garments of humility. She won't spend her time tooting her horn, making herself seem elite because there is a piece of this remnant in every nation of the world. No doubt in churches across America, there is a remnant, a remnant, a remnant who will recognize the ministry model shifting. And they will have the desire for that mo ministry model that shifts the striving effort of the stick through the peaceful authority of just speaking that word. Jesus said it. Jesus understood it. He was that creative spoken word. All he had to do, peace be still. We wave our hands. We karate chop. We intercessors do some of the craziest movements. We look like we're orchestrating some kind of invisible war sometime. But Jesus just held up his hand and said, "Peace be still." When it came time to cast the devils out many times, he he might not have even lifted his hand. He just said one word, "Go. Modern Charismatics Deliverance Ministries interview people for three hours. Fill out 300 questionnaires. 300 questions on a questionnaire. Ask them things like, "Did you ever play with a Ouija board? Did you ever step on a crack and think you broke your mother's back?" And all kinds of other silly things. And Jesus just took the most possessed and said, "Go." And guess what? They had to &gt;&gt; worthy of every song we could ever sing. Worthy of all the praise we could ever bring. Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe. We live for you. Oh, we live for you. Jesus, the name above every other name. Jesus, the only one who could ever save.

You are worthy of it all. For from you are all things and to you are all things. You deserve the glory. You are worthy of it all. Lord, you are worthy of it all. For from you are all things and to you are all things. Oh, you deserve the glory. And all the saints and angels they bow before your throne. And all the elders cast their crowns before the lamb of God and sing that you are worthy of it all. My God, you are worthy of it all. Oh, for from you are all things and to are all things. Oh, you deserve the glory. &gt;&gt; Let's tell him. Oh, &gt;&gt; he deserves it all. &gt;&gt; You brought us this far. &gt;&gt; You brought us this far. &gt;&gt; You are worthy of it all. &gt;&gt; You'll take your bride the rest of the way. It's your worthiness for from you are all things. Jesus, you are all you deserve the glory. &gt;&gt; You deserve. &gt;&gt; Sing it again. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; I want to make sure you're telling him, Lord, you're worthy. You're worthy. &gt;&gt; You are worthy of it all. &gt;&gt; You've brought us a mighty long way. You've been good. &gt;&gt; My God, you are worthy. You've been good every step of the way through the wilderness. &gt;&gt; You've proven yourself. &gt;&gt; For from you are all &gt;&gt; and we know you'll be there to take us all the way. &gt;&gt; You are all things. You deserve the glory. &gt;&gt; Now Lord, we pray right now for courage and boldness with wisdom that comes from you. It's who you are &gt;&gt; to be upon your people. We ask, THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, IF WE LACK WISDOM, WE SHOULD ASK for it. So, SO LORD, WE ASK right now for the wisdom of the of the King of Kings to be upon us. &gt;&gt; May we move in wisdom that is beyond our years of experience and beyond our learning. Lord, may we move in a wisdom that is of another world. We're often faced with circumstances and situations that we don't know how to maneuver. But if we could be if we could operate in your wisdom, Lord, &gt;&gt; you said to to Joshua through your word, be strong and of good courage. May Lord may we know your strength. The one THING WE CAN REJOICE IN IS UNDERSTANDING from scripture that your strength is made perfect. In our weakness now Lord, we've got the weakness and you've got the strength. We're yielding ourselves. Do it with me. We're yielding ourselves. Lord, &gt;&gt; we're yielding ourselves &gt;&gt; that your strength would be upon us. &gt;&gt; We want to move with strength. &gt;&gt; We want to have that overcoming anointing that moves in the strength of the Lord. And you said joy. The scripture tells us joy. The joy of the Lord is our strength. May we have joy. May we not be discouraged in times of slow movement and little progress. May we hold on to your hand and understand that the time seasons of the Lord change quickly and we can be walking in one one moment of time and see the gradually become the suddenly. We just have that strong strong inspiration that a shift is upon us again. And Lord, we want to navigate it with the wisdom of the Lord and the strength that is not ours, it's yours. Come and do that for us. Would you, Lord? May we be freshly dedicated and consecrated to the obedience of your word. May we not be so rigid and so formal and so hard, so stiff that we cling to anything that that you desire to break forth with something new. You see, we recognize that your ministry model was to move under the inspiration of the spirit of the Lord and bring freedom to the oppressed and healing to the sick and deliverance to the captives. And Lord, it's not that any of us would want to build a reputation in ministry. It It's your name that we want to glorify. We want to see this little bride come into the fullness of her inheritance. You said it was ours. &gt;&gt; Most of us would quickly disqualify ourselves. And you are ever standing with your word and spirit to re-qualify us &gt;&gt; to tell us you called us &gt;&gt; and all we have to do is yield. May there be a new sense of yielding. As brother Gley prayed today, if there's any part of who we are that we have reserved or held back from you, may we may we open the door now and allow you to move in every part. May you be able to fully occupy your little bride for the days of visitation are over and these are the days of occupation. And I heard you say this morning at my dining room table as I was studying that that that little lad was insignificant in his day. But even as you have spoken to us before, I will bring you from obscurity to visibility, from visitation to habitation. And we've been holding on to those words. And I believe Lord that now is the time to grab a hold of that with the deepest faith that we have. We are no longer satisfied with just a feeling or a momentary visitation. Lord, come and occupy your people. We know that's your desire because you said it. You wanted to build a house. You wanted to build a home in us. Why don't you just tell him before we leave, Lord, come and build your home. Let me be your dwelling place. &gt;&gt; This is not a one-man thing. It's a it's a generational call, &gt;&gt; Lord. May I be one of those, &gt;&gt; fully occupied harbori. May I be fully occupied by the heavy presence of God that brings with it all his wisdom and all of his strength and all of his courage and and his mind. That we would no longer keep reverting back to our own thoughts and opinions, but that we would begin with supernatural strength to know your thoughts and to know your heart. May we may we find the value in laying our head on your chest &gt;&gt; in relationship in closeness in intimacy &gt;&gt; that we might know the very heartbeat that we might move and be regulated by your heartbeat. We don't want to be doing something that you've moved on from. There's a time and a season for all administrations. The scripture says there was a time that you use printed tracks. If you're still using them today, I want to have them. I want to be giving them out. But it seems to me that under this age, you said that we are living epistles, living letters &gt;&gt; read by all men. It seems to ME THAT IT WAS your desire in this last day to live in A BRIDE, TO OCCUPY A BRIDE UNTIL WE BECAME the track, until we become the demonstration of what a laid down, surrendered life looks like. Will you surrender your will today before you go? Will you surrender your will? Would you just say, "Lord, come and have your complete way in me. If you want to rebuild me and shift me and change me, I I I'm willing. I I've worked on changing myself and I don't get so far. But Lord, I I open up my life. Come in, execute change. Reveal to me a pattern that you would have me walk out. Lord, haven't many of us proven that if you'll make it clear, we'll walk it. We don't have to see the next 10 years. If you'll just show us the next step, by your grace, we'll take it. And every time we take the next ordered step of the Lord, we loose the favor and blessing to finish the call. If you've called us, you have to equip us. We surrender. For from you are all things and to you are all things. You deserve the glory. Somebody lift your heart and hands and tell him again, "Oh, you are worthy of it all. You are worthy. You're worthy of it all. &gt;&gt; I've seen what you can do. I've seen what you can do. For from you are all things and to you are all things." &gt;&gt; Lord, help us to build an atmosphere. You deserve it. &gt;&gt; Where the supernatural can demonstrate &gt;&gt; in our everyday life, not just when we get together. &gt;&gt; Worthy of it all. &gt;&gt; The lamb is worthy. You are worthy of it all. For from you are all things. &gt;&gt; From you are all things. and to &gt;&gt; and unto you are all things &gt;&gt; you deserve. &gt;&gt; You deserve &gt;&gt; Come and sing it again. &gt;&gt; Let's get lost in it for just a moment. &gt;&gt; Day and night, night and day, night and day, let in. Lord, let us be on our watch. Day and night, night and day, let in. May we not come down. Day and night, night and day, let in. &gt;&gt; A sword in one hand and a tool in the other. Night and day in. &gt;&gt; May we not let the detractors cause us to come down from night and day in. &gt;&gt; Let the watchman rise in this hour. Day and night. Night and day. &gt;&gt; What of the night? Oh, God of the night. &gt;&gt; Day and night, night and day, let in. Yes. Yes. Day and night, night and day, you are worthy of it all. Let your bride take her place. You are worthy of it all in the dimension of intercession. For from you that only flows out of truth and spirit are all things. &gt;&gt; You deserve the glory. &gt;&gt; You deserve the glory. &gt;&gt; Again, &gt;&gt; I know it's late. &gt;&gt; You're worthy. You're worthy of it all. &gt;&gt; How many of you have seen what he can do AND YOU JUST WANT TO SAY, "Just once more, Lord. &gt;&gt; Of it all. &gt;&gt; Just once more, Lord. Show yourself mighty overcome. You are all &gt;&gt; Let us see the miraculous. &gt;&gt; Let us see the supernatural again. &gt;&gt; My God, you deserve the glory. &gt;&gt; Use us to bring in a final harvest. &gt;&gt; You deserve the glory. &gt;&gt; Oh, you are. &gt;&gt; May the lamb receive the reward. &gt;&gt; Yes, you are, Lord. You are worthy. May we dress ourselves in the cloak of humility. May we hold to the lamb's head all things to &gt;&gt; in honor and hope and holiness &gt;&gt; and in humility glory. You worthy of it all. Oh, &gt;&gt; I don't know if you feel that that he's here. &gt;&gt; All for you are all. &gt;&gt; Let it flow out of him. &gt;&gt; And let it flow out of you, &gt;&gt; unto him. &gt;&gt; You deserve the glory. When I was sitting there this morning preparing my my last thoughts that I didn't get to, I was reminded of a of a visionary experience that I had in 2010. And I saw in a distance four angelic beings coming my way. I'm not embarrassed to tell you it wasn't a dream. It was a visionary type thing. And I was curious as to what they've come for. And I asked, "Why are you here?" Their answer was, "We've come to help you hold to his head." It's in Colossians. It's vitally important. I'll minister it Tuesday night, Lord willing. It's vitally important that we hold to his head. &gt;&gt; And I said, "Well, how will I do that?" And one by one, they answered one word. One said, "In hope." One said in honor. The next one said in holiness. And the fourth one said in humility. And then one by one they began to talk to me just a little bit just just a little bit about what those words mean. And it's in the scripture. We can't lose hope. I know that the value of faith perhaps is higher than hope. But hope is believing with great anticipation and expectation and and and waiting on the promises can certainly cause you to have this this hope deferred can can bring the Bible said it can bring sickness to your bones. And so we can't let our hope become deferred in such a way that we say we're tired of waiting. We're tired of waiting, Lord. We're tired of waiting. We have to keep holding his head and hope. It's coming. My faith answers the challenge. It's coming. God's got something for us greater than what we've experienced. And then in honor, we've got to learn to honor the lamb above all. And we're going to have to learn to honor one another. And that's going to be part of that fusion I was trying to talk about, I will later, of the generations coming together. We've got to honor the generation before us. We can fe we can see their mistakes. We can feel and and recognize where they may have missed. But we cannot let that cause us to bring dishonor because but by the grace of God, we'll fall in the same holes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we've got to learn not only to honor the generation before us, we've going to have to learn to honor one another in a way that's a lot different than what we see happening in this hour. And we're going to have to walk in holiness, which is not the way you dress and the way you do your hair. We like to sometimes refer to holiness as that. But it it means the choice of the Lord. You're the choice of the Lord. He's chose you for this hour. &gt;&gt; And if he places his holiness on you, if he places it on me, I'm holy. &gt;&gt; I've just got to make sure to walk under that, not walk out from under it. &gt;&gt; And then humility without him. Let's Let's be real. hillbilly. Without him, we ain't nothing. &gt;&gt; We ain't nothing. Never will be without him. But with him, we can be all that he says we are. So, would you ask the Lord this week as you go? Would you ask the Lord to help you re be reminded and remember and and and never forget to keep holding on to him. Hold the head of the lamb. That's what abiding in the vine is all about. You're drawing strength from him. How many of you found that he's the greatest source of strength. &gt;&gt; I know you got to go, but there's something here. Lord, as we leave, we don't want to leave you here. We want to take everything that you are, everything that you've ministered to us by your presence today. We want to take it with us, Lord. May we not let anything disturb this peace. Oh, the enemy will bring something up before the day is over to have us back on the bandwagon of chaos and criticism. But Lord, I ask right now that we would be so mindful and so discerning that we would keep choosing peace. Oh my. Go with us Lord Jesus today. Thank you for these beautiful, wonderful visitors. May they take something with them also tangible. Lord, may we all make a choice today whether or not we're willing to be identified with the rejected remnant, misunderstood remnant, to keep moving with the lamb. When you go, we want to go. When you stop, we want to stop. When you change direction, we want to change direction with you. We're following the pillar of fire, not the picture. We're following the pillar of fire. Go with us today. Lord, continue to perfect your healing in every every person's body represented here and on the stream. We're tired of this sickness among us. We want to walk in health. Day and night, night and day, let incense arise. Day and night, night and day, let incense arise. Day and night, night and day, let in arise. Day and night, night and day, let in arise. Day and night, night and day. Let us be like, we soak up your presence. Night and day, let in arise. Day and night. Night and day. Let in sins arise. Yes. Day and night. Night and day. Let in sins arise. Day and night. Night and day. Let in sins arise. Day and night. Night and day. You are worthy of it all. &gt;&gt; Sing it through one time, then you're dismissed to go in the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Worthy of it. &gt;&gt; You don't have to wait until we're through singing. Thank you for being here. God bless you. &gt;&gt; For from you are all things. &gt;&gt; Greet brother Trent Brent on his birthday. &gt;&gt; You deserve the glory. &gt;&gt; Sister West has a birthday this week. Pray for her tomorrow in Landon May next Saturday. Pray for these that aren't able to be here today. May God just bless you as you go. You are worthy of it all. For from you are all things and to are all things. &gt;&gt; You deserve the glory. &gt;&gt; You deserve the glory.
