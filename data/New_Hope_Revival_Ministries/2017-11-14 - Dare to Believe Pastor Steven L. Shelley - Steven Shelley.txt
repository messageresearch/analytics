TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hello I'm pastor Stephen Shelley I'm coming to you from New Hope revival ministries in Smith Station Alabama us of a and we're coming to you for the gospel channel our great partners and Friends I am so thankful for the relationship that the Lord has given us with brother Eric Erickson and the staff of the gospel channel also Omega television Omega television throughout the island of Iceland and then the gospel channel reaching into the far ends of the earth with the gospel of Jesus Christ with the good news I'm coming to you from our brand-new studio we are so thankful to the Lord for the way that he has provided it came supernaturally it came by faith one step at a time but God has provided the need and we were so blessed a few short weeks ago to have your founder and director brother Eric Erickson come to Alabama to dedicate this studio with us during our international camp meeting and I tell you I can get a little teary-eyed thinking about the presence of the Lord that filled this little church and filled this studio and we just have so much to be thankful for and now God is giving us this opportunity to speak to you all across the UK and wherever you might be watching this program we believe that exciting days are ahead for the Ministry of Jesus Christ and we think that exciting days are ahead for the gospel channel and so we want to encourage you to continue to stand with them partner with them financially and with your prayers don't ever underestimate the power of prayer they need you to stand with them agree that God will continue to provide for every need you know I want to mention that that Christian television is not cheap it's not free and they have to pay for the airtime for the satellite time to get the gospel to you and if you are blessed by the programs here on the gospel channel then I want you to partner with us first and foremost in prayer but also with your finances because I believe that it is good soil and I feel that in the next season you're going to see some things increasing the anointing increasing and the outreach increasing and I think you're gonna feel very blessed to have been a part of the gospel channel during this last season standing with them in faith and in prayer you know faith is one of the things I want to talk to you about today in order to do that I'm gonna have to be a little bit transparent and I hope you'll allow me to do that but I'm going to share with you something that's kind of been happening in our local assembly our local church and I'm doing that because I feel that it is not just a word for us for new hope revival ministries or for Alabama or even the US I I feel like it's a message of encouragement to the Bride of Christ to the people of God wherever you may be we see a lot going on around us and we know that we're living in in troubled times the Bible speaks of perilous times well this is perilous times but there's never been a more appropriate time or a more needed time than today for the people of God to rise up in faith and begin to exercise the authority that God has given us to bring the kingdom of God into further advancement this is that hour I know people will often say you know evil is increasing and darkness gross darkness is covering the earth that's what the Bible said but it also says that in a moment like that it's for you and I to arise and shine and let the light of Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah emanate from our lives from our personal lives you know I believe that Christian television isn't and is a very effective media to encourage the people of God it's not only a tool for evangelism to reach the lost but if we can find you right where you are maybe you're a little discouraged maybe you've experienced some Hope deferred you've had some promises from God and it looks like that they're just never gonna come you know they are but you're weary and waiting and you're discouraged you know all of us get discouraged at times it's not something I particularly enjoy talking about but it is reality and where do I find my encouragement when I get in that place look there's only one place to find it and that's from the Lord it's from his word it's from those moments of private personal worship it's in those moments where we can find that place of quietness to just lean on his shoulder and let him love on us and maybe you're watching this and you've never experienced that reality it's available it's available if there's something in your life that's standing in the way of you having that intimate relationship with Jesus Christ now would be a good time to get that under the blood to repent to say Lord forgive me have mercy on me you know I'm finding that the Lord is a very patient father I'm finding that he is good and that His grace is sufficient for all of our needs and so what I wanted to say is Christian television is not just about reaching the lost we feel that if we can encourage you as a believer if we can encourage you in your daily walk with Jesus Christ then you're going to have the passion restored you're gonna have your fire lit you're gonna be be desirous to go out you're gonna you're gonna feel the function of the Lord again to go out and just live the God life in front of other people I really believe that's going to be one of the ways that the final harvest is brought in one on one your life making a difference pointing people to Jesus Christ so that's going to be what what we desire to do with the studio that the Lord has given us we come to you weekly on our regular broadcast of the Eagles cry and from time to time we're going to be setting in for brother Eric Erickson and for the staff at gospel channel and we look forward to a day that we're going to be able to come to you live from Alabama all across the UK and around the world and we're getting ready for that we're getting geared up for that because we want to partner with them not just for the reaching of the Lost but also to encourage the discouraged because I really believe that so much is going to be accomplished in the kingdom of God in this last day by just one on one living the life in front of each other finding community finding your tribe finding those who are going through what you're going through and one of the ways we do that is by being transparent you know sometimes in the body of Christ we pretend to be superheroes who who never go through trouble who never go through moments of doubt who never have questions why don't we just get real why don't we just be real in this last hour just where the rubber meets the road so to speak drop the facade and just cry out to the Lord I'm hurting I'm in need I'm a little discouraged I'm a little disappointed and I need your help and then sharing it with others there must be somebody somewhere in your life and your community in your church that you can just be transparent with and if not I'm gonna pray that the Lord will lead you to somebody I was recently in a meeting with a family a large family and we were talking about the struggles of life and the pressures of life and it was a moment of honesty and we went around the room this family blood blood relatives and we went around the room and began to speak our struggles what we were going through some of our past what we were fighting what our temptations were and you would be surprised that in a blood family some of them living in the same home they were able to express the same troubles the same temptations the same battles and it was like a light bulb was coming on in their in their head Hey huh I'm not by myself you know the enemy takes advantage of isolation and he was telling some of those young men you're bad you know you should never have thoughts like this this should never be going on and because they thought they were the only one in the family maybe the only one in the church community going through those kinds of things the enemy takes advantage of that isolation and he accuses and he intimidates and he seeks to destroy so honesty that night was the key just finding someone that you can be real with I'm gonna try to be real with you every time I come whether it's here representing the gospel channel or whether it's the Eagles cry or any other programs that we may produce I don't have a huge reputation to maintain I just want to be real and I want you to know that your struggles matter to God and if you can believe it they matter to us and that's why we're doing what we're doing in fact I believe that's why brother Eric Erickson is doing what he's doing if we ever had any ambitions of fame or popularity we gave up on those many many years ago I just want to be a friend of the bridegroom I just want to be somebody to help encourage the Bride of Christ and so that's what this program today is about I said a moment ago in order to share what I feel like the Lord would have me to share today I would have to be a little transparent about our own church community and I'm going to do that in just a moment but let me invite you to call the number on your screen contact the gospel channel contact New Hope revival ministries and we will pray with you we want to know about your need we believe in the power of agreement we believe in the power of corporate prayer we know it's very very important to the overcoming Christian life to have a personal individual prayer life something that you develop through the years of how you can communicate with your loving father and that doesn't always look exactly the same for everybody but however you can find that place where you can sense that the Lord is listening where you can position yourself to hear his voice that personal prayer life is vitally important always has been but it is particularly important in the hour that we're living in right now but with that we get the benefit of joining together in prayer and that's what we want to do new hope revival ministries wants to stand with you agree with you over your prayer needs and then we want to hear when God begins to move we found out a long time ago that sometimes we have to give God praise when we see the mountain moving just a little bit we start saying thank you Lord there's hope in sight and each time the mountain moves a little farther and farther in the right direction we just keep on giving God praise until faith rises to the level that we can fulfill the words of our Lord speak to the mountain and watch it move a few weeks ago the Lord began to deal with us concerning the issue of unbelief we as a ministry for many many years since 1990 we started receiving really spectacular promises from the Lord by the prophetic gifts God was really speaking to us using many different people in many different gifted ways some were little grannies who God would use to give an utterance and tongues and yes that's still a part of God's New Testament plan the gifts of tongues and interpretation someone else would rise up with an interpretation but in the end it was God who was speaking to his people the Lord would deal with us in visions and dreams and because of a faithful staff those prophetic promises were chronicled they were recorded they were typed out transcribed you might laugh - to realize that we as a ministry since the early 90s have a copy some form cassette cd/dvd old VHS tape of almost every service that we have had in these past how many years would that be a lot because we not so much because we thought that every word was the Lord that every word every sermon that everything that happened in the course of a service a prayer request or or what a baby crying we didn't think that it was all sacred but in order to find what was sacred in order to hold on to what was sacred we knew that we would just have to somehow gather and guard and protect it all and that's what we've done that's the positive the negative is sometimes when you're dealing with with church life with problems that can arise when people butt heads and we've had some some head-butting through the years we've had some disappointments we've had some betrayals but we've had some amazing miracles as well sometimes in your mind you're trying to balance it all out and you just get weary the Bible talks about being weary that we should not be weary in well-doing for we will reap in due season if we faint not well I confess to you that I fainted spiritually I fainted before exhaustion mentally and emotionally you just get drain some time giving everything you have to give and and sometimes more than you have to give and what what happens is your hope becomes a little deferred your heart gets a little bit sick and you begin to wonder I guess I never really wondered if God was going to do what he said because he's proven that to me in all the years of ministry some of you might remember my testimony I received the baptism of the holy ghost in 1975 and began a public ministry that has spanned the entire time from 1975 to the present and I've seen God do some outstanding things ranging from the healing of cancer to to even the racing of the dead I know that God is faithful I know that he has proven to me through the years that his word is yay and a man but I'll tell you where I fainted I fainted in this in this particular area of of wandering at times is it worth all the trouble I almost said my original thought and what I said to my congregation not sure that I can get by was saying it on here but I think I might I wondered if it was worth all the hell all the darkness that you have to go through the battle that you have to fight the everyday grind to get to that point I mean it's obvious that in those early years when God began to speak to us about his plans how we wanted to use us for for bringing deliverance to others and and miracles by the spoken word etc and how God was going to help us develop the property that we have and how we were going to reach out to the nation's all these big promises that God had made and so at times I felt almost like giving up not on God really but I wondered if if the battle was was worth if the victory in the end was worth the everyday battle if if enduring daily attack and whatever we go through in life was really worth it all in the end when you begin to see God do what he was even as ice say and I feel I feel I feel kind of dumb saying it but I'm telling you that when you get to that place of weakness you can say and think all kinds of crazy things things that you know better and then when you repeat them later you how did I ever think something like that but that's where I failed I came to this place where I just wondered is the is the daily grind going to be in the end is it going to be worth the daily grind is the victory in the end going to be worth the daily battle I'm telling you it is I'm telling you that it is worth it God used a very precious friend of ours some of you know the life and ministry of Paul Keith Davis and God used him in a particular way in the summer time of this year my son was graduating from home school and he came as a real favor a real gesture of love to our family he came to speak at Benjamin Judah's graduation it meant a lot to us and it particularly meant a lot to Benjamin he agreed to stay over for the Sunday morning service and he began to speak to us and he began to talk to us about things that were happening in his life and how details were lining up and confirmations were coming and I personally know some of the battles that he has gone through in the last few years and and I know that at times his hope has been deferred and and his heart has been sad and he's bent almost to the place of wondering if it was all going to be worth it in the end as well but he began to put all those things together and and at the end of that he spoke about an experience that I had had with the Lord 10 years ago on that particular day 10 years ago today that was I was by shock I'm not my memory doesn't always work that way and I had no idea that this was the 10 year anniversary of an experience that I had had with the Lord where he promised that he was going to deal with the areas of strongholds in people's lives that we could enjoy a freedom in our church community across our state and by the grace of God around the world nathie the Lord was gonna deal with strongholds that had been keeping people batten we find that strongholds are generally mindsets that we get hung end stuck in and it takes the Lord it takes something happening to shake us to cause us to awaken so that we can get those strongholds pulled down in the authority of Jesus Christ and move forward in in faith and in belief so I just heard the Lord I don't know how to describe it I just heard the lord as paul keith was speaking i heard the lord saying this is me the lord building my case it really strengthened me the lord was laying out his faithfulness through the past he was showing us confirmations and letting us know it's worth holding on just a little bit longer can I tell you if you're considering giving up if you're wondering if you're gonna be able to endure to the last battle so that the victory that God has promised you and your individual life can come and you're wondering now if I'm really gonna be able to hold on to the end let me pass by your way today and tell you hold on just a little bit longer because God may be using this delay to deal with something in your life that you may not be completely aware of and that's that measure of unbelief that can grow in you through the years of disappointments I want to read a scripture to you before I move on any further is found in the book of Mark in the Gospel of Mark chapter 9 beginning in verse 14 and it talks about a man whose son was in a pitiful condition and so he came to the Lord in verse 14 and when he came to his disciples he saw a great multitude about them and the scribes questioning with them and straightway all the people when they beheld him were greatly amazed and running to him so him and he asked the scribes what question you with them and one of the multitude answered and said master I have brought unto thee my son which hath a dumb spirit and wheresoever he taketh him he tarath him and he fo myth and nashit with his teeth and pine it away and I speak to thy disciples that they should cast him out and they could not he answered them him and saith o faithless generation how long shall I be with you how long shall I suffer you bring him unto me and they brought him unto Him and when he saw him straightway the spirit tear him and he fell on the ground and wallowed foaming and he asked his father how long is it a ghost since this came unto Him and he said of a child and oftentimes it hath cast him into the fire and into the waters to destroy him but if thou canst do anything have compassion on us and help us jesus saith unto him if thou canst believe all things are possible to him that believeth and this next verse is an important part of this story it's it's a true story I believe I don't believe this is a parable I don't believe this is an allegory I believe this day really happened that a father brought his son seemingly possessed by some kind of spirit manifesting in in physical demonstration seizures of some kind foaming at the mouth so severe that the boy would both fall into fire and water driven by some unseen force a force that desired not to just crippled that boy it desired to destroy his life this father and desperation brought his son to the disciples of the Lord maybe not wanting to bother the Lord and assuming these men are with him perhaps they have the same power he does but they were not able to do anything about this spirit that was tearing this little lad and so to Jesus the dad reached out I like this the way he said this request I like the way he worded his his petition here he said if you can do anything if thou canst do anything have compassion on us and help us I'm not sure that sounded like a real determined faith but it was enough to get the Lord's attention because then Jesus said if you can believe all things are possible to him that believeth but this next verse is where I've been in my life at times it's where you may be right now it's where we were as a church community and straightway the father of the child cried out and said with tears lord I believe help thou my unbelief this is a powerful prayer I've actually heard sermons through the years criticizing this man for not being able to muster enough faith but this man knew that there was unbelief present he knew there was discouragement present in his life he knew that he had been to the point of giving up concerning his own son wondering if there would ever be deliverance if there would ever be healing or if things would always be as they had always been so in this very transparent moment he prayed one of the most powerful prayers that any of us could pray today lord I believe help thou my unbelief for some reason it reminds me of the prayer that the Lord prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane the Olive Press Gethsemane means the Olive Press the place where the olives or the grapes are squeezed until the life until the oil until the juice extracted our Lord was praying in his olive press there was a life in him that needed to be pressed out so that you and I could receive that same life as a gift even as the disciples received it on the day of Pentecost by the baptism of the Holy Spirit you and I can receive that same life that was squeezed out of our Lord in that moment of temptation in that moment where it would have been easy to forsake the Father's will he prayed a prayer like this Oh father if it be possible let this cup pass from me if that was the end of a story it would have been dark and it would have been disappointing but it's not the end of the story not by any means he prayed with the most powerful word he prayed nevertheless this is how I'm feeling Lord I'm feeling like Oh father that I'd like for this cup to pass I'd like for things to be different now but he didn't stop asking the Lord to do it his way his father to do it his way he continued nevertheless not my will but your will by will be done this was a moment when our Lord confessed that his spirit was willing but his flesh was weak my mind makes a connection with these two prayers this man was completely honest I do believe Lord help my unbelief he became so aware by the words of our Lord that convicted his heart there is a measure of unbelief present in me our church community after all the years of waiting now we've seen God do continuously beautiful things leaving a service very very encouraged but not the full reality of what we are expecting the Lord too and it's the journey it's the process it's the molding and the shaping and all of that can make us a little bit weary and I feel like somebody is watching this program today and you know exactly what I'm talking about because you've been made weary by the everyday pressure of the potter's wheel sometimes God puts us together so that we can bump up against each other and knock off those rough edges and I have to be honest with you there's more to come there's going to be some more knocking around there's going to be some more pressure on the potter's wheel there's gonna be some more fire in your life but I believe that if we can come to this place where we just get really real with the Lord why wouldn't we be he already knows our heart I hope you know by now that he doesn't just listen to the words of our mouth he knows our heart his word is so powerful and so quick and so discerning that it's able to go right down into that separation of soul and spirit the soul being made up of mind will and emotions and I don't know about you but that's where my battle is that's where my thoughts are and so sometimes in my spirit that which has been renewed and regenerated by the Spirit of life that flows from Jesus Christ my spirit cries out Lord I believe but then there's that other voice the voice that comes from my mind and from my will and from my emotions and it says but I'm tired of waiting I'm tired of waiting is it ever gonna be and so what I believe the Lord wants us to do across the land across the world the body of Christ we need to be honest about that measure of unbelief that's creeping up in our inner soul in our mind and in our will our thoughts our emotions we need to be honest about it not try to hide it we need to give it to the Lord so right where you are I'm inviting you before we leave the air in a few moments I'm inviting you to be honest do to be real before the Lord and pray even as we have prayed as a community New Hope revival ministries and and I've prayed as an individual in fact I've prayed it every day since God made it real to me not once actually dozens of times I was combing my hair this morning and I was talking to the Lord Lord I believe help thou my unbelief and for me it feels so good to say it it feels so good to be honest I know that unbelief is is sin I know that God is not pleased with unbelief but I also know that he's a good father and I also know that the only way that I can get that unbelief taken care of by repentance and getting it under the blood and covered by his love is to admit that sometimes that weariness that tiredness of waiting on the promises of God can actually become unbelief and I believe that unbelief is probably the only thing that can keep God from moving in your life in my life to the fullest potential of his power I remember hearing a preacher say many many years ago when I was a small boy that doubt and unbelief in essence tied the hands of God well I guess I believe that there are times that his love for me his belief in me has had to override or overwrite that little unbelief that was within me because I've seen God move in times that I had to stand back and say that wasn't my faith that wasn't my prayer that moved God that way I saw God move and I saw the results of his moving but I knew that it was not my faith that did it that was grace because God sees your heart he knows the intent of your heart he knows the love that you have for him if indeed you do and when that unbelief creeps up it must be disappointing to him it must have been disappointing when this man came and listened this man was he received further discord Richmond because now the disciples can't do anything about it no wonder in exasperation he finally said Lord if you can do anything about it I sure would appreciate you doing it Jesus wanted to help but he oh boy he wanted to see the boy delivered and set free there's no doubt about it but he also wanted to help the father because this situation was not the only situation that that man was going to face in the rest of his life here on earth and jesus yeshua wanted to help him overcome that nagging gnawing unbelief because if we don't deal with it it doesn't go away and it doesn't shrink in fact it multiplies and it grows until like weeds like tears it chokes out the good seed i believe God has given us authority in our community to deal with unbelief in fact we've been declaring every service corporately our season of unbelief has ended in reality I can't say that in the past few weeks I haven't had my doubts I can't say that I haven't had those moments of reflecting back to my old thought patterns but I can tell you this by making that declaration by praying by speaking many times over the course of a day lord I believe help thou my unbelief those moments of doubt those thoughts of unbelief those thoughts of weariness and discouragement they're lasting shorter and shorter the the the duration of them now it's down to a few seconds we're in times past it could have been the discouragement of a whole day I could have spent the whole day depressed and you know exactly what I'm talking about I know there may be some who are brushing this off as though it couldn't possibly relate to their life but I'm talking I'm speaking to someone right now who knows exactly how it feels to love the Lord with your whole heart not you the desire you have this desire not to ever be disappointed in him and yet struggling with the fact that you're not seeing the results that you feel like he promised and so this word this moment is for you right now in your home or wherever you are why don't you decree why don't you declare there's power in the spoken word there's power in speaking out truth I believe that on a scientific level a biological level that every cell of your body is designed by God to respond to your voice if you don't have the boldness to speak it out then then let it be the most powerful thought that you have right now but if you can can squeak it out or shout it out you should declare right now my season of unbelief is over lord I believe help thou my unbelief and listen at what happened when straightway the father of the child cried out and said with tears lord I believe help thou my unbelief when Jesus saw that the people came running together he rebuked the foul spirit saying unto Him thou dumb and deaf spirit I charge thee come out of him and enter into him no more enter no more into him and the spirit cried and rent him sore and came out of him and he was he was as one dead in so much that many said he is dead but Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up and he arose and when he was come into the house his disciples asked him why can't why couldn't we do anything about this why couldn't we cast him out and he saith unto them this kind can come forth by nothing but by prayer and by fasting that means there's a process involved there is a timeframe involved there is the question of faithfulness and obedience and sacrifice involved I'm learning that in order for some of the promises that God has made in our life to come to full fruition there's a process involved of proving again and again Lord I'm going to believe Lord I'm going to be faithful Lord I'm going to obey you when I don't know what else to do I'm going to do what I've always done in faith believing that when I need to do something different you'll give me those instructions and by grace I'll be able to recognize that it's your voice and step up and do whatever it is that you're calling me to do faith is a powerful force what is faith faith is the substance of things hoped for and it's the evidence of things not seen in order to operate in faith we have to operate from the unseen realm because sometimes what we speak is not what we see in fact I'm finding out that in this process of believing God and watching God perform his word my feelings often have nothing to do with my faith and I've got to keep them separated in other words you know sometimes we receive prayer or sometimes we pray and we get up from our prayer or we move on in life from our prayer and we don't feel any better we still feel the symptoms of our sickness or we don't see any major breakthroughs with our lost loved ones or we don't feel like we're moving any closer to God's ordained plan for our life and so everything about us feels the same so feelings are legitimate I'm not in any way diminishing the importance of our feelings because we're emotional beings with with lots of feelings but what I am saying is if God's Word said so and you're willing to be honest about your faith lord I believe help thou my unbelief any measure of unbelief that's in me I submit it to you I'm not hiding it under a rock I'm not pretending to be super Christian I'm just being real I want you to see it I want you to help me with it I don't want to hold on to my unbelief if you will learn if I will learn if New Hope revival ministry folk will learn to approach God in that way just honest and open hiding behind anything I truly believe that God will give us grace to separate our feelings from our faith I remember one time a great man of God brother William Branham was ministering in a prayer line and there were unbelievable incredible miracles taking place and night after night and in one of those meetings he he exhorted the people he said when you come through the prayer line and you believe God for your healing and the word of the Lord is to you that you're healed you're going and you don't feel any better you don't feel healed he made this statement what does feelings have to do with it that's a bold statement to make do you agree but it's an accurate statement there must be a separation between our feelings and our faith our feelings are based on what we think we know our faith is based on what we know our feelings are based on what our senses our five senses are telling us or our memories those thought patterns of past disappointment that continue to dictate our daily life but our faith can tell us something entirely different do you believe that you believe that your feelings can tell you it's never going to be any better and then all of a sudden faith rise up in your heart seemingly from out of nowhere and say oh yes it is lord I believe help thou my unbelief I'm encouraging you right now to put your feelings aside and I wouldn't ask you to do something so difficult if I didn't have to do the very same thing mmm more than once every day here are my feelings they're legitimate I have them I might not like them but I have them but I'm sitting them aside here's the measure of unbelief that exists because of disappointment sometimes sometimes your disappointment in people your disappointment in others can actually affect your ability to have faith to believe God what's God got to do with what other people have done to disappoint you so I've had to set them aside I'll have to set them aside before I go to bed tonight probably I will again tomorrow you will too why don't we get started right now why don't we just say my feelings they're legitimate but they're not according to faith there's something on the inside you say well brother Shelly I don't I don't have that kind of faith the Bible says you do the Word of God says to every man is given a measure the measure of faith so it's there it may be under used it may be under developed but it's there you've been given a seed of faith I'll tell you this the more we lean on our feelings the more we lean on our five senses the more we lean on our own human understanding and reasoning faith has a tendency to shrink but the more we use it the more we apply it the more often we set our feelings aside and we say it's not by sight faith is not by sight it's not even by hearing we can just say Lord I'm going to believe because your word said that I can and your track record with me says I can believe you I can trust you I just want to lead you in a prayer because I truly believe that what God is doing in our local community of faith it's it's a bigger thing I believe it's bigger than my life I believe it's bigger than the Saints who worship with us in this tiny little place I believe that God's people in general are dealing with these same kinds of issues and I believe there are many of you watching this program right now that can totally relate to this and I want you to know that without faith it's impossible to please God but I know that there's faith in you this very moment one of the ways that I encourage my faith from time to time and try to build myself up praying in the spirit praying in the Holy Ghost is to remember the faithfulness of God when I look back over what God has accomplished in my life and for my family my two sons had a pretty serious wreck a few months ago the truck was totaled the phone call came it's a phone call that nobody wants to receive no parent especially I went friend a brother in the Lord with me we didn't exactly know what we were gonna meet when we got there I can't tell you that I was just cool as a cucumber you know what that expression means I can't tell you that I was just you know whistling but I can tell you this I was confessing from the innermost part of my being Lord you are faithful you are righteous you are good I don't know how this is gonna turn out but I know that you are not going to verse 8 me or my sons I know you're not going to forget my family and I know that whatever happens it may not be good but it's going to be for my good when I start looking back over that or all the times that God has healed me and brought me through a few years ago I was hobbling around like an old man long before my time my feet were not only hurting but they were deformed and and I was fighting really to stay alive the discouragement and of not being able to walk comfortably many times seemingly was almost to take me out I even told my wife I'm ready to have my feet cut off I'm tired of suffering and God moved for me he brought healing to my body and he gave me strength so all I have to do is think about those things his goodness his past track record in my life and I start feeling again wow I can believe you Lord if you did that for me you're the same yesterday and today and forever and so that's a key I'm giving you a key if you're willing to take it and put it in the lock praise worship Thanksgiving reflecting remembering what the Lord has done for you in the past will help you dare to believe for what God wants to do in your life today and tomorrow and for the rest of your journey here on the earth would you just be real with me right now would you just be honest with me right now if you've got a particular prayer request I would be more than happy and the prayer warriors the intercessors and our ministry would be so glad to pray with you to take your needs before the Lord and I would love for you to take the chance to share them with us the gospel channel there's a phone number also that you can call and there will be prayer warriors there I know that well that will take the message and they will pray and they will seek the Lord on your behalf but I want to pray with you right now I want to take the few minutes that we have left to just say I feel like somebody is going to be honest with your measure of unbelief that's been creeping up you've got faith you do believe but things have been getting a little bit discouraging for you lately and I've got a feeling that somebody right now somebody's you're gonna be real you're gonna lay that before the Lord you're gonna confess it to him the Bible tells us that's what we do we don't have to approach God like we're gonna accidentally telling something he doesn't already know he already knows the deepest part of who we are so I think he delights when we're willing to just confess our weakness before him I know the Bible did say let the weak say I am strong so you can come to the Lord and say father I'm weak that's what that's what Jesus prayed my spirits willing but my flesh is weak you can confess your weakness to the Lord and then when you're done praying that's when you get up and say I'm strong because it's not about feeling you may still feel weak but it's not about that is it it's about faith it's about believing God let's pray together right now father I am so thankful that you've given us this opportunity you've given us this amazing studio and you've given us this amazing opportunity to speak to people and I do believe there may be someone watching who doesn't know you and I would ask Lord that your grace would cover them right now and that they would repent that they would confess their sin that they would invite you to come in with your blood and wash away every sinn deliver them from the spirit of iniquity and set them free to serve you but right now my heart is going out to believers to those who love youth to those who know your word enough to have invited you into their life there may be some who have only trusted you in in in the form of joining a church or having some identity by birth maybe feeling like I was born into a Christian family and that is not enough and so Lord I'm asking you to draw them maybe you're drawing them right now they're thinking there's more to this born-again life this Christian life and and if so I'm asking you to manifest yourself I'm asking you Lord to make yourself known and real to them right now let them know that this is a daily relationship one day at a time I pray that you would make that real and I also pray for the believer who has prayed and prayed and prayed about particular things and not seen the results or someone who has had precious promises given to them from your word or from the prophetic gifts and they've not yet seen the reality or the fruition fulfillment of those things and they've gotten weary I'm praying for them also right now that they would lay all unbelief before you that they would come Lord even as this precious father in the Gospels came and said if you can do anything Lord I'm asking you to do it and and you spoke to him and said all things are possible to him that believeth in the man so honestly lord I believe help out my unbelief we're praying that right now across the world we're praying that to you right now Lord Lord we believe helped our unbelief help our unbelief to shrink help our unbelief to be bathed by the blood of Jesus Christ may we be set free from it may we be delivered from it may we have the Grace and the wisdom of God to set our feelings aside and let faith arise may we just take this moment Lord to thank you for your track record with the one you give us in the word the one we read about in church history but the one we know about our personal individual experience with you you've never failed us Lord you've always been faithful and true you may not have come the moment we wanted you to come and yet you've never been late you're always right on time it may not have happened exactly the way we wanted it or expected it but you have such a way of bringing your will to pass and then comforting our hearts and letting us know this is me this is me lord help each one right now to recognize that this is a journey it is a process we don't get it all right at one time we don't get it all right today and not have to work a little at it tomorrow it's not that we're saved by works that's not at all what I what I'm saying but Lord we have some ups and downs we have some herbs and flows we get knocked down but thanks be to God your people get up again by your grace by your strength so I'm asking you to raise up right now encouragement on your people whoever would watch this broadcast whoever would hear these words Lord let them make contact with you it can't be my prayer only let their prayer let it arise let their faith arise right now and let us all confess lord I believe help out my unbelief I'm asking you Lord for the strengthening of faith and I'm asking you for the acceleration of your promises in every life that's watching this program right now in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ and for his glory I felt that I could feel his presence getting nearer and nearer and nearer and I'm asking him to let you feel that right now to let you feel the gentleness of his presence and yet the realness of who he is when he comes can I tell you it's going to be all right because God is good and as I said a moment ago everything that happens in your life is not good but it's for your good it's for my good and in the good times we have to bless his name in the bad times we bless his name like David prayed after the great loss of his son the Lord gives and the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord this posture posturing ourselves to give Thanksgiving to God in all situations I'm telling you that's what will shrink that unbelief that's what will cause us to go forward lord thank you for the gospel channel thank you for this new studio thank you for every person watching this program right now I just feel incredibly blessed to have had this chance to be with you so pray for us pray for the gospel channel know that we're praying for you and don't forget to send in your prayer requests because we want to go to God with you and we also want to hear your praise reports we're here because we love you we want you to stay tuned there are many many tremendous words of God that are gonna be spoken to you on this network and I believe you should prepare yourself for much much more I know we have a lot more that we're going to be bringing to you in this new season so as we go off the air why don't you do it right now right where you are make this declaration my season of unbelief is finished it's over lord I believe help thou mine unbelief thank you so much for spending this time with me today I've thoroughly enjoyed speaking to you because I could feel you on the other end take care bye bye [Music] you [Music]
