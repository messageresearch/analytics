[0:00] we're not calling heaven the promised
[0:01] land we're calling inheriting the
[0:03] promises of god now
[0:05] the promised land
[0:13] god is raising up men who have no desire
[0:17] to cover up their sin who have no desire
[0:20] to cover up their shortcoming they just
[0:22] desire to bring all of that into the
[0:23] presence of the lord and see what god
[0:26] will do with it when you come to him
[0:28] bring it all somebody said but the lord
[0:31] said i can't ascend to the heel of the
[0:32] lord you come stand at the bottom of the
[0:35] hill and worship god with everything you
[0:39] have
[0:42] your warts
[0:44] your lack of integrity if you have it
[0:47] your anger issues
[0:50] your inferior autis your insecurities
[0:53] don't you let any of those things keep
[0:55] you from worshiping the lord if you
[0:57] can't worship on the holy hill you
[0:59] worship at the bottom of the holy hill
[1:02] and you say here i am lord
[1:05] with all my failures with all my sin
[1:08] with all my unbelief with all my
[1:11] hang-ups with all my slacknesses but i'm
[1:15] here to worship you
[1:17] and to call you holy and to call you god
[1:22] sovereign
[1:23] god sovereign
[1:25] god supreme
[1:27] the only true
[1:29] living god
[1:32] not three pieces of pie
[1:34] trying to function
[1:36] as one but one god
[1:39] functioning in three divine offices and
[1:42] many more expressions of who he is
[1:45] in the everyday life of the believer
[1:48] he's not looking for subjects
[1:51] he's looking for servants and there is a
[1:55] difference
[1:56] a subject will obey because his very
[2:00] life
[2:01] and substance depends on obeying the
[2:04] edict of the king
[2:07] but a servant
[2:08] a real son
[2:10] who chooses to be a servant
[2:14] he doesn't worship in fear
[2:17] he doesn't approach god afraid he
[2:20] approaches god with boldness knowing
[2:23] that there's a more perfect sacrifice
[2:25] that's crying out on his behalf you
[2:28] stand at the bottom of the hill in
[2:29] worship if that's all you can do until
[2:31] god cleanses your hand and purifies your
[2:34] heart and then you do like the scripture
[2:36] said get up
[2:38] don't stand at the bottom of the hill at
[2:40] cadets barney forever there's a promised
[2:43] land that we're supposed to take
[2:46] right now right here
[2:49] and now
[2:50] we're not calling heaven the promised
[2:52] land we're calling inheriting the
[2:53] promises of god now
[2:56] the promised land
