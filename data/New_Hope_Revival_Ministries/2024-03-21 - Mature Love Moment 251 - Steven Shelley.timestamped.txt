[0:00] so we are learning to love with a mature
[0:04] love which is an unconditional love it's
[0:07] the love that God has loved us with he
[0:10] didn't love us any less when we were
[0:13] unlovable he loved us the same and this
[0:16] is the kind of love that we're being
[0:18] called to in this hour as the bride of
[0:20] Christ if you want to be successful in
[0:23] anything you do for the Lord you must
[0:26] love you receive love and you know there
[0:30] are those of us who struggle in
[0:33] receiving love I know people who who
[0:36] really struggle to say the words out
[0:39] loud to the Lord I love you
[0:42] Lord and you don't want to be critical
[0:45] of somebody like that because they're
[0:47] struggling with receiving love and when
[0:50] you struggle being
[0:52] loved it becomes automatic that you
[0:55] struggle expressing love but if you
[0:58] could catch a revelation today of how
[1:01] much he loves you with every shortcoming
[1:04] with every failure with every bump on
[1:07] your nose or wart on your
[1:10] elbow with with your with your crooked
[1:13] eyebrow with your Hang-Ups with your
[1:17] complexes he loves you you are valuable
[1:23] in his
[1:24] kingdom we know this and we quickly say
[1:27] Amen but to know it changes everything
[1:29] everything to really know it to really
[1:34] know that God loves you in your Uprising
[1:37] in your
[1:38] downfall he loves you in your successes
[1:42] and he even loves you through your
[1:44] failures his love is not fickle it's not
[1:48] relative and it's not conditional he
[1:51] loves us
[1:53] unconditionally and because of that we
[1:56] learn to receive love and when we learn
[2:00] to receive love it's easier for us to
[2:02] give love and to express love is anybody
[2:05] with me and so if you can develop a
[2:08] relationship with the Lord where you can
[2:11] not only tell him that you love him but
[2:13] you can show him by the life that you
[2:16] live it becomes easier then to live a
[2:19] lifestyle of Love toward the brothers
[2:22] and sisters so it really goes back your
[2:25] ability to love one another as Christ
[2:28] has loved us it really goes back to an
[2:31] element of whether or not we can receive
[2:34] his love he's good to us the ability to
[2:37] receive God's love and to and to use his
[2:40] love to let it flow through us like a
[2:43] pipeline it must bring an authority in
[2:47] the realm of the spirit are you
[2:49] following what I'm saying it it must
[2:51] bring a boost to our prayers love it
[2:55] must bring authority to the way that we
[2:58] deal with things in that other other
[3:00] realm and in that other dimension so
[3:02] love transcends the dimension that we're
[3:06] operating in now the the realm of the
[3:08] natural love transcends the realm of the
[3:12] natural and it moves into the realm of
[3:15] the Supernatural and when the
[3:17] supernatural is activated by faith
[3:22] anything cancer has to die anything can
[3:28] happen
