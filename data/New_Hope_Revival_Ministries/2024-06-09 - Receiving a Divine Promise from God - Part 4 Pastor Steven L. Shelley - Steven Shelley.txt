good I don't hear you isn't the Lord good today yes he's worthy to be praised Let's uh thank the Lord for the musicians thank you God is good amen if you need to go to the washroom go now so that you don't have to come in and out so much during the preaching of the word unless you have a little baby and you have to see to those needs but there's a lot of movement that takes place even in the worship service today so much movement and it seems so many just walking around in the vestibule don't don't do that if you can help it come back in here especially carrying on conversations out there that that's very distracting to those of us who are trying to build a service in here it takes every one of us concentrating pulling together in faith for the Lord to move among us the way that he wants to move because we have so many distractions in life is that right I I'm I'm not getting on to you I'm just doing my job and I'm doing it in a good spirit so far and so I just want to ask you to be mindful you may not be on the platform but your responsibility is huge because we're coming together to be in one mind and one Accord and you don't want anything to you don't even want your child to hinder you if you can possibly help it but we understand that you have to you have to meet those needs but thank God we have uh we have the archive and you can go back and hear a section perhaps that you missed but we we want to see what God will say today the um the the text started coming in fever fever sick fever and uh the there was a voice I'm not going to say where it come from but there was a voice that said you really want to keep preaching this theme because it seems like that uh if you're preaching this then the people are really tested well okay that's all right the word is still the word and he is still the Healer and he is still able to do exceedingly abundantly above that which we could even ask or think we thank God for every streamer today may the Lord bless you I glance just a moment ago and and you are joining us from all over the world and we are blessed let me just mention this real quick while we maybe getting your Bible if you like to read it in your Bible today is uh is sister Lily Klein's birthday birthday and we want to say happy birthday and God's blessings to her did I see that she's got a like an even number now or something I'm not going to mention it I'm not going to mention it just thank God it's not 50 and you'll be all right you're all right but we want to pray for her and tomorrow is brother magnuson's birthday in Iceland and it's also Mercy's birthday tomorrow so we want to say happy birthday to Mercy and Paul and Martha we don't see them a whole lot but they're streaming and we want to say happy anniversary to them tomorrow Tuesday is Ariel's birthday and um how old are you going to be 15 wow that's old it really is it's also the day that so many years ago in 1933 it was on June the 11th that brother Brandon was baptizing in the Ohio River he was baptizing the 17th person when a light came down on the river and spoke a commission over his life confirming that God was going to use him in great ways and he has Wednesday a sister Sharon's birthday and you may be busy but you still have to have a birthday it's just got to happen so uh let's say happy birthday to sister Sharon God bless [Applause] you Thursday is Sister Alita and brother Richard's wedding anniversary and we want to say happy anniversary to them and uh those two days the 12th and the third 13th are chavot uh on the on the Hebrew calendar I know there are different uh observations of that time but if you're in Jerusalem that's when you're going to celebrate it you're going to celebrate it on those two days and uh I've been blessed to be in Jerusalem on those days and celebrate first the giving of the law and second the giving of the Holy Ghost um and then on Saturday uh one more birthday Saturday is Norah where is Norah you see her there she is you've got a birthday you're going to be 11 or six I thought are you six you're going to be six really you're five now let's say happy birthday to Nora six I knew you weren't 11 I knew that I was kidding you're supposed to smile and laugh a little bit would you remember the families of two very well-known ministers around this message who went home to be with the Lord this week one was uh Reverend Ewald Frank from cyfield Germany 90 years old still preaching and um and um well God knows he knows I'm so thankful that there is deliverance and uh there is redemption under the blood amen and we pray for his family as especially his son Bernard and and their family we've had great fellowship with him we ask the Lord to be with them and then uh Pastor Leonard barudi passed away you may not know that name but he is very well known he's from the Congo in Africa French Africa and um he has had the blessing of pastoring the largest church in this message for many years now he was the father of bringing the message ACR Across the Nation of the Congo there are more Believers of this message in Congo than any nation of the world and on a conservative Sunday he has 20,000 people in his congregation and when they have Fellowship meetings together they have 55,000 people gathered together in the Congo and uh now because of they're being so many who believe and follow this truth there are members of the government all the way up to to the to the Palace who who believed this truth and uh so the impact of his going home is going to be great for many people and we want to remember uh he was in Canada when he passed away and it was a very difficult process you can imagine to get him home and and his church is very very grieved today unexpected really and so we want to pray that God will Comfort them Mark 11 let's read these two verses again before we take our seats uh for this service God is good he's good all the time he never fails he's always right on time never misses an appointment if he said it you can believe it for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith now that is just you know uh no mistranslation there that is what it says and uh that's in red and it means uh it was spoken by our Lord our Messiah Our Savior I believe every word of it and uh if you got the little text on Friday you you heard us referring back to something brother brandom said he said we expect things to happen instantly he said doesn't always happen instantly but he said don't you say it didn't happen because he said if just one little grain of sand turned loose roll down the other side then you know The God Who loosed that one grain of sand to move that mountain is able to move the rest of it and and really that's kind of like we were talking about the tingle in the finger one little sign of promise and if you see no sign if you see no improvement you still praise God and and really if we follow this truth and the scripture we don't even ask again we come back to praise the next time Lord I Thank you that I'm Healed I thank you that it's done do you follow me let's go a little further in this lesson and I wouldn't really call these sermons this is a uh this is a study in God's word and in the message concerning some powerful truths you can have what you say I believe it I believe there is uh power and authority in our mouth on uh on Tuesday night we talked about nevertheless at Thy word I'm going to take you at your word I've already tried fishing didn't catch anything I'm ready to go to the house but if you say to stay and go out a little bit deeper that's exactly what I'll do would you say it was worth Peter's time I believe it was I want you to go to Revelation 12 and verse 11 just one verse and uh this will be the next section of this study Revelation 1211 and they overcame overcame done it's done now in this in this context and they overcame him that's Antichrist Spirit by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death for some in in Great Tribulation in for some that will mean physical death but for others it is a spiritual death we die to flesh and our own will and ambition but that doesn't mean that there won't be those who give their natural life they absolutely will and if you think it can only happen in Great Tribulation uh the time the ending of the time of Jacob's trouble you're you're wrong it can happen now we're living in a wild wild society and so may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated they overcame him there's something about the blood and the word that comes out of your mouth when your word what you say what you testify what you witness to If It lines up with the finished work of the cross that was purchased for us by the blood that finished work is a transaction of Grace that took place with a token price and that token price was the blood had to be blood somebody say it had to be blood and there there is an overcoming portion there's an overcoming anointing there's an overcoming power a quickening unction for those who will keep their testimony on the word remember he said don't ever have a negative one you got to keep a positive one what comes out of your mouth matters the whole scripture tells us that we we are to uh we are to speak truth and and uh we have to be careful because the enemy wants us to be uh thermometers and we don't need somebody to tell us how bad it is or what the temperature is we need a thermostat we need somebody who can affect the atmosphere with their words and with their faith is that right all right let's go on in the message uh the angel of God Toledo Ohio I like this one he said and friends if I had time I could talk from here till week after week and never tell you a third of what I've seen him do of the Great and Mighty things now that's a lot of things that brother brandom experienced and at nighttime I just wonder which what to say that he'd want me to tell you of some of the things he's done just as a testimony and he said I believe we overcome by the blood of the lamb and the testimony is that right he's the Prest he's the high priest of Our Testimony we finished out on Tuesday night talking about the fact that he is the high priest of our confession which is the same as testimony what comes out of our mouth if you could just go back with me to we have found him come and see and I want to go down to just paragraph 23 for those of you that weren't here on Tuesday night and won't check the archive I don't want to do the there you go that was quick thank you but when you believe you have you say yes I am then you believe you're a Christian you can't show nothing that you are but you believe you are you believe you are and when and then when you confess that you are and when you confess him and he confesses you he's a high priest working on what not on your crying not on your repenting not even on your faith he's working he is working off of he is interceding based on your your confession no matter how much Faith you got it'll never do you any good this is powerful till you do what you put works with it you put words with it for faith without works is dead is that right now look at 24 this is I believe this with everything that I am he can only do as you [Music] say we limit God a limitless God and yet we limit him in his capacity to impact our individual lives and how do we do that with what we say and quite often what we say is based on on the level of our faith but there's sometimes when our faith is low we can get somewhere by confessing something stronger than what we're feeling even when you feel that your faith is weary you're tired of waiting you're worn out instead of confessing I'm weary I'm tired of waiting I'm worn out you can confess it's already done the work is done the price is paid and when you do that church he promised to be a high priest of what we confess of what we testify we have overcoming power that's Anchored In The Blood and the word of our witness the word of Our Testimony and he's there before the presence of the Majesty to make good anything that his Redemptive blessings call for his sacrifice that's what he paid for and standing there to make good to you anything that you say isn't that what we just read somebody said I'm not sure about that isn't that what we just read that what Jesus said absolutely whatever you say you can have what you say if you speak it without doubt now that that's that's where the I mean that's where we that's where we get bottlenecked that's where we come to a screeching halt but we've got to we've got to practice speaking Faith according to the word I'm I'm going to wait for your amen faith in action is the next message that we wanted to look at in this study paragraph 64 when that great redeemed host stands around the Throne of God waving The Palms in their hands and the white robes washed in the blood of the Lamb will tell the story how we've overcome how did we overcome by the blood of the lamb and there testimony what they speak Hallelujah he said well what is their testimony there it is Jesus there's your testimony there's your testimony he lives Messiah lives Jesus is Alive he hasn't lost his power he's still able to heal the sick and raise the Dead He's Alive this time in his church he's not in a one man body anymore he came because of shavat he came there they were gathered together in the upper room they had some business to take care of his promise that promise that he made I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you you shall be in what's the word indued you shall be indued you shall be infused with power from on high and that wasn't a third person in Trinity you need to know that there's no such thing that's the very same spirit that overshadowed Mary and she conceived as a virgin that's the very same spirit that spoke and created everything that we know in creation Same Spirit and this time it fell on a body of Believers I'm so thankful to be a a a benefit officiary of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit he said oh let it ring out through the mountains to the hills send the message far and wide what's our testimony Jesus Lives he's not dead but he's alive I'm so happy to stand here in one of the major cities of the world Chicago and claim that Jesus Christ raised from the dead and by his grace listen we can prove it to you how can we do that because we're a Mark 16 group of Believers there's a New Testament Church rising up and all that means is fulfilling Jesus commission they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover they shall cast out devils and if they drink any deadly thing or take up serpents they'll not be harmed that's what the word said and that needs to be Our Testimony how is that possible because he's the same because he's alive because he's not dead because he now lives in a corporate body of Believers filled with the Holy Ghost you don't even have the completion of the new birth without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you need him not it you need him in your life especially in this hour especially in times like this he said I'm so happy all right and and by his grace can prove it to you amen he said then let your sin cease what is sin unbelief take the idols from your hearts and Believe on the Living God and accept the blessings that he died for praise God how many of you want to accept the blessings that he paid for they're mine they got my name on them they've got your name on them except the blessings that he died for and here's really powerful phrase and appropriated for you he found a way to get the life of the word inside of you he did it by the baptism of the Holy Ghost he didn't want you just to trust in a book knowledge just that printed page of the word a lot of people get very hung up on the printed page but I want you to know that's only a written record of a living word the word became flesh the word didn't become a book the word became flesh in our Messiah and he is all God you can say that all God the Bible tells us that in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily so if there was a voice it was from the God that was within him if there was a dove it visited from the God that was within him there may be other physical signs and manifestations but here o Israel the Lord thy God not three he's one now he goes on to say take those Idols from your heart believe on the Living God same quote and accept the blessings that he died for and appropriated for you and here is the phrase that I want you to grab a hold of put your faith put your faith into action how do we do that by believing and by testifying that we believe I believe well who am I talking to anybody that'll listen sometimes I'm talking to my symptoms lying vanities he told us they are you know sometimes we pray against the symptoms and the symptoms aren't the problem there's a root in there we want to just not only speak to the symptoms but we want to speak to the root of it and we command you I command you to die in the authority of Jesus Christ cancer remember what he said if if you can get the people to believe you nothing will stand before you not even cancer well you might say that's because he was a prophet but I will say it's because he was a representation of the Living World word cancer couldn't stand before him not because of his prophetic office but because he represented the Living Word the same Christ and so therefore it's not your office that's going to shake the devil it's the Living Word it's the living Christ inside of you that's going to move the enemy and he will move he how do you know cuz he has he does and he will you can speak to symptoms you can speak to your neighbor you can speak to your wife you can speak to your children I know I'm whole I know I'm Healed and he's able he said if we would make the right confession that's not a thought a confession may start with a thought but a confession is something that comes out of your mouth with some vocal cords some tongue action amen he said he was able to make your your body yes your body all the bones and the muscles and the blood vessels and the capillaries all the all the systems and organs of your body that make up this flesh body that you live in he said he is able to make your body obey conf your body it's part of creation and therefore it has to submit itself to the authority of the Creator is that right now what if you're confessing I'm dying what if he makes your body obey your confession what if you're confessing this is killing me my toe is killing me is it is that the message you want him to Bear Before the Throne as the great high priest of your confession that your toes killing you you're looking at me funny the Bible said we're snared not by what we think we're snared by the words of our mouth you can think the wrong thing and pull it down before it ever becomes words but once it comes out of your mouth there's an obligation to that word that comes out of your mouth hallelujah hallelujah you're not starving to death you're hungry Speak Life it makes a difference somebody say I don't think that really matter what you said it it does matter most of us have tested it and proven it to be true and we're putting our faith in in action that message is faith in action 55 you should hear it in the great warrior this great warrior Joshua he goes on now now why didn't he go over there and clean out all the Philistines and so forth God and I'd say come on you got something to do too God just don't poke things down your neck you've got to believe it here is where we really don't like it we like those ripe cherries falling on us from a tree we really don't want to work for what we get it but he said you've got to do some fighting you've got to push down some thoughts come on it's like I told you about a a diagnosis last week this certain kind of of there we have white blood cells that fight disease and infection and inflammation in our body and and we thank God for them we really do because when we speak our a word of faith if you read that quote something happens in the cells of our body when we speak the truth it responds to the sound of our voice that's what the word tells us it teaches us that but you get this diagnosis I because your your certain kind of white blood cells are elevated so I go look it up and and it says you know you if if this is the case you you you need treatment you need further evaluation but keep in mind that it can be anything from a seasonal allergy to cancer I want to one more time time point out the big gap between a snotty nose and something eating you from the inside out so you can't just Google your symptoms and know your condition come on you got to be careful what you read well I got a little blood I see blood I have blood well I want you to know that's something to pray about for sure but you can't just go to Google cuz it'll have you ready to you you know uh a little message might pop up and say you need to make your final Arrangements you know a funeral home might advertise right on the Google thing and tell you you know whatever you do do quickly go ahead and make your plans listen folks we don't have to listen to something like that we've got Authority God's not going to poke it down our neck he's not going to force us to believe anything we got to do some fighting yes fighting doubt hello fighting lies it goes on it goes on I'm getting a little help as Peter cartright said to the drunkard that day many of you has read this told him said what are you going to do here said I'm going to hold a meeting said who told you the Lord said you'd got to whip me first that's some old uh you know Rebel Rouser what are you doing here to the preacher Peter cartright surely you've heard of the name and said what are you doing here I'm going to hold a meeting who told you the Lord and the old man was foolish enough to say well you going to have to whip me first Peter cartright said well if that's my next job you can smile you can laugh glad you told me what to do next all right undone his coat beat him up it's brother Ram telling the story beat him up got on top of him and and got beat him in the face some of you like that too much said I must oh I like this listen what he said this is his famous quote he said I must fight if I should reain increase my courage Lord he beat the guy up said you got enough he said to the guy you got enough the guy said yep shook his hand come on back to the meeting and got saved anybody with me oh I like it if I I must fight if I should Reign we we are excuse makers we make so many excuses for ourselves the Bible said Thou Art inexcusable oh man no excuse is going to suffice you've got all the power that you need and all the authority that you need by this Living Word if you'll just take God at his word and do something about it he said that's just what we need you you got to do some fighting not with your fist let me say that again not with your fist unless necessary for Peter cartright it was necessary for brother sheffy it was sometimes necessary whatever's needed but this is not the kind of fighting we're encouraging you to do because really it's not your fellow that's your enemy your enemy is what's going on in your own body in your own life it's a man in the mirror the Henson wrote an unbeli I think it was the Henson Goodman sung it I think the hens wrote it an unbelievable song many years ago that said I saw the man that crucified the Lord and the verse says I happened by chance to to face an old Looking Glass a mirror and there he was staring back at me I saw the man that crucified the Lord our our worst enemy sometime little sister Wright Evelyn Wright from our church in Columbus she was there from the start she sang in a trio with my grandmother she worked at Crystal until she retired her whole life that's what she did she she was a woman who struggled sometime to keep the right attitude but a precious lady she had been grossly mistreated in life she would stand up to testify she would say I want to thank the Lord for saving me sanctifying me and filling in me with the Holy Ghost he's never done me any way but right he's never been the problem my problem has always been this woman living between these two elbows she's the one I have to struggle with I dare say that you and I struggle the most with the one who lives between our own elbows God's not the problem even faith is not the problem sometimes it's what we say he that becomes the problem you got to go do some fighting not with your fist but with the power of God with your testimony that's how you overcome by the blood of the lamb and by your testimony with your testimony thank God for it that tell the devil tell the devil here's somebody else you can talk to somebody said brother Shelly you were praying talking to God and all of a you started talking to the devil so they know who's who neither one of them are confused I promise you when I'm talking to the Lord he knows I'm talking to him and then when I start rebuking the devil in the middle of my prayer the devil knows I'm not talking to the Lord the Lord knows I'm not talking to him the devil knows I'm talking to him it's all right to talk to him sometime get Jesus did Jesus did get thee behind me Satan somebody said well that was cause Jesus was God that's not what brother brandom told us he said by inspiration he didn't use those Powers against the devil that day he didn't use the authority of who he was he wasn't using any of that messiahship he used the only thing that ever defeats the enemy he said it is written the word of God will defeat thee enemy tell the Devil he's got no strings tied to you you put this disease on me but Jesus Christ delivered me from it he promised it to me to me that's in the great warrior Joshua and no wonder it's called so powerful in a title like that what about what hearest thou Elijah he said now listen when you're watching for the Holy Spirit now there's nobody believe this is a good one very good one he said now listen when you're watching for the Holy Spirit there's nobody believes in shouting and rejoicing in the spirit any more than I do because I believe that anything's got life has emotion so if we have a Revival they're calling it a Revival of emotion well if emotions are being revived and coming back to life and being quickened it must be because the word's doing something in US it must be because our religion is no longer dead it must be because we're living by faith now and not by religion and if your religion hasn't got some life in it you'd better bury it instead of telling people it's Superior you're settled now you've got the fullness of the word it's dead he said it brings emotion sure it does but while we're coming to god let's come reverent ly this is powerful quietly listening to see what he will say and then when he does something for us that's the time to let the glory of God rain from our hearts brother brandom is instructing people about the pearline because the the the Methodist and the Baptist and the pilgrim Holiness and the Nazarene and some of those conservative Christians would come to be healed and brother brandom meetings line up by the thousands to be prayed for and when they came to be prayed for in the prayer line they'd come very reverently very quietly sometimes the Pentecostals because they are excitable and they're used to expressing more emotion in their in their contact with God they would come up and before brother brandham could ever speak to them they were already manifesting and brother brandham was trying to explain to them what you need to do if you're coming to God with a need you come reverently quietly listening to see what he will say you you come through the pearline and and then you know these days somebody wants to tell you everything that's wrong with them they you've got to listen to the whole doctor's prescription before you can even pray how many of you know God knows he knows sometimes people will tell you something it's not even what they come for God knows he said you come reverently to hear what God might say and then when he does something for us and that's always when we believe that's the time to let the glory of God rain from your hearts then you can do some manifesting be reverent watch and if out in the meeting at any time listen anytime out in the meeting you feel that God has spoke to your heart while the lines are going through raise your hands and say thank you Lord Jesus for healing me it wasn't about being prayed for by the prophet having your need discerned having your doctor's name revealed it was about the atmosphere of Faith doing that was like a hook it caught the people's attention it inspired their faith you don't have to have hands laid on you to claim the promise of the word you may be right in the middle of a sermon sometime and something might strike your heart that's mine that's when you throw up your hand and say thank you Lord that's mine I claim that I take that and it matters because that's part of your testimony and that's how we're overcoming not just those in the tribulation great day but even now that's how we're Overcoming By the blood of the Lamb that cleanses us from all unrighteousness and by the word of our witness he's the same he's a resurrected Christ are you still here then he said tell somebody sitting by you we're having a prayer line up here Faith strikes your heart you claim your promise where you are in your seat he said just reach over and tell somebody what the Lord's done he just healed me I just felt his promise and as I said see how quiet it gets see I said the other day we're afraid to testify because we're afraid it'll come back that's not how this thing works you can't be afraid to give God praise he's worthy of Praise whether your symptoms play around with you a little while or not he's worthy by the blood of the lamb and their testimony they overcame is that right you overcome by the blood of the lamb and by your testimony if we can just have faith and believe in the Lord God that he will I believe him anybody else expectation oh God hear the prayer of your servant and as this is closing our services on this tour for this beautiful wonderful God save America it was a a tour he said oh God send the angels of God down tonight and may there be such an outpouring of the Holy Ghost or the Holy Spirit to literally every person in the building be healed Grant it Lord you know that sounds so outlandish so farfetched so unbelievable so grandiose but I happen to believe that if the right atmosphere is created and you put doubt out of your life I I happen to believe we can have a service like that where every person in the room takes a hold of God's word and receives their healing I believe it I believe it's the bride's inheritance please hear my prayer God as I try to serve you pleading everything I've got God while we're trying to do something for you help me dear Jesus to be your servant and and may many many many people people uh in this building tonight everyone that's sick and Afflicted be made completely well I I'm reading this because this was his faith The God Who heals the individual is God to heal he's God to heal the whole kitten Kaboodle he's God enough to heal them all hello well some things don't turn around God can turn anything around God can turn dementia around God can turn any situation around if we have faith to believe that's what he said you know they the blind man testified he was healed and they mocked him they made F of him I'm Healed hear ye hear ye I'm Healed oh crazy man crazy crazy man healed blind as a bat just as blind as he ever was tapping along getting in everybody's way telling everybody that God healed him at the meeting but he kept doing cuz that's what brother brandham told him the rest of the story is he went through the perline more than once he came back through at least twice maybe three times some people say and brother brandham told him every time I said you're healed I told you you were healed go now you're healed and he still has to be helped off the stage that would be pretty discouraging to us to him he finally got it second or third time he must mean it he must not just mean generally he must be mean me individually so that's when he started testifying as he sold the papers here you here I'm Healed sitting down in the barber remember you know this story Church of Christ Barber days of Miracles are over No more healing today hahaa I hear you were down at the meeting the other day he said yes and the Lord healed me and his eyes popped open Hallelujah he said I can see and brother random said they come back and told he he jumped out of the barber's chair and run down the street with the Barber's apron on him the cape on him and here come the Church of Christ Barber behind him clapping his hand he's healed he's healed I thought you just said that he didn't heal anymore there's nothing like a seeing it to make a Believer out of you if you've ever seen God do something like that I have it's easier for you to believe that he'll do it again I said he'll do it again oh Lord how happy we'd be we give you all the praise the glory we know that thou are here to make well to answer you're a loving father a go between standing between sickness and death oh how wonderful you are amazing grace how you saved us by your grace healed Us by your stripes made us completely Overcomers of all things in the beloved Son of God now Grant a great outpouring tonight in the name of thy son Jesus amen that's pretty powerful prayer isn't it one more on for now maybe two how can I overcome paragraph 178 overcome how by taking the word the promise remember this series is receiving a Divine promise from God overcome how by taking the word the promise in humility humbly walking you don't have to be arrogant to testify of his healing power in your life it's just a deep settle peace comes over you this consecrated cross I'll bear until Death Shall Set Me Free then go home a crown to wear let us pray and listen to the prayer Lord Jesus our in 15 minutes now standing here trying to take your word and explain to the people that was a short one by the way trying to take your word and explain to the people how to overcome you told us how it's done you didn't only tell us but you showed us how it was done you led us you led us hallelujah thank God you showed us how to do it here it is here's the prescription receive the word inside of us and be sure to hold of that word you can't hold to the word with your hands you hold to the word with your faith it is in every temptation but be humble walk humbly then we have conquered through you through your power which is already this is good this is good folks which has already conquered already conquered our enemy and the only thing we have to do is just walk humble with faith believing that and our Badge of identification of the Holy Ghost and guess what has to happen Satan has to move does anybody believe that do you believe what the Bible said whosoever humbleth himself under the mighty hand of God him will God exalt in due time resist the devil possessing all things look what Satan did when Jesus laid the word down on him it's also written he jumped away from the from that wire as I said the other night yes sir then what after you overcome how do you overcome could you ever do it by yourself no make sure you understand no no no I've just got so much anxiety I can barely come to church do you really want Jesus to confess that before the right hand of power and authority Lord I'm here to Bear uh my brother's testimony my sister's testimony to you they've got so much anxiety they can barely come to the house of God he is the high priest of sometimes you have to be willing to be a little uncomfortable to obey his word there's power in obeying God's word I wouldn't want that to be my confession I'm so nervous I'm just about to fall to pieces somebody's going to have to pick me up I've been there I know exactly what that feels like if I talk about it too much I can feel that way right now once you've ever gone through that kind of a place and you begin to talk about it or hear somebody else talk about it you can almost feel that thing working on you again but I know there's an answer to get us through it's not put on somebody said I don't even believe it it's real folks it's real panic attack real anxiety real all that real OCD real but remember what we learned it's all in your mind it's real it's real but it Reigns only in your mind it has no Authority anywhere else so you rewi your mind by grabbing a hold of the promise of God and saying I have already overcome anxiety by the blood of the lamb and by the word of my testimony I testify that the work is done it's finished and I'm not going to wait till I feel it to move in the opposite Spirit I'm going to do it now I'm going to put myself out there now well that got exciting how do you overcome could you ever do it by yourself no somebody went before you remember tempted in all manner as we are yet without sin you think his heart ever nearly exploded with anxiety I would think so you think he ever got nervous in the flesh I think he would remember 100% God 100% man that's a lot everything that a that a man everything a woman go through everything you go through in your mind he went through in his mind the word said in all manner does that mean he was ever tempted to be jealous the Bible said in all manner yet without sin he understood that just because a thought comes does it mean I have to act on that thought does it mean I have to entertain that thought he knew exactly how to push it down you can't overcome by yourself but somebody went before you and overcome for you it's Christ it's the Messiah it's the anointed one and where is he now living in is believer living in the body of Christ it's Christ I'm just an heir of it I I don't have to do anything I'm an heir of the promise the only thing I have to do is put my faith that's a big question isn't it sister Flo do you see it do you see it well you said you did last Sunday and you said you did Tuesday night but I wasn't with you on Monday did you see it on Monday you said you did on Tuesday night did you see it on Wednesday I wasn't with you you see that's where we've got to get amen that's no accusation that's just just instruction that's where we got to get when we hear the word we hear the quote we we get it yes sir I believe that but when you go home your head's throbbing do you believe it then well I think I'm coming down with a cold you can if you want to must be the flu it can be if you want it see do you see it you see what you've got to see somebody say what do I have to see what do I have to look to what do I have to keep my eyes on the finished work the finished work oh Hallelujah the finished work I want you to go quickly I I don't need much more time you're going to be shocked maybe I don't need a lot of time um but you know what I forgot to put the scriptures back in my notes I gave them to you the first scriptures in Hebrews there I think I'm not sure exactly what I I guess I could pull it up here I forgot to go back and plug them in my notes I I put them in your notes uh yes thank you yes just two places looking under Jesus this is Hebrews 12:2 looking un Jesus do you see it do you see it here's what we're going to see looking under Jesus the author and finisher the author and finisher remember he gave every one of us a Measure of Faith that's that's the beginning of our faith that's the beginning of our faith the author he's the author because he put it in US you you didn't just you know it's not just a regular attribute God placed in you a Measure of Faith you were born with a Measure of Faith that's God the author of your faith he put it there but but that's not enough the same God who placed the origin the embryonics of faith in your life is the god who knows how to bring that Faith full spectrum and finish it out now what is completed finished Faith or super Faith that's calling those things that are not that's being able to say what you don't see like brother was singing I'm so glad he sees what I don't see and so I've got to I've got to hope to see what I don't see and how do you do that by looking to the Unseen remember the message looking to the Unseen I've got to find out how to poke my head up above what I can see and look off to Jesus in the midst of the pain and believe that's big looking unto Jesus author and finisher of our faith who for the joy remember in the series on Joy who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross did you know that was you that was you as an overcoming end time believer that placed that Joy within his heart the Old Testament Prophet said he looked and saw his seed he saw what was to come he saw the finished work of faith in the hearts of end time Believers and it brought joy to him in the midst of his greatest suffering when he was on the cross you and I were on his mind he endured the cross despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God not sitting by the first person of the Trinity sitting with his father in The Throne the right hand of God is the right hand of power and authority he's both the author and the finisher now here's another one you know this well come on stay with me just a little while longer this is Hebrews 10 10-14 but by the wit write that down Hebrews 10 10-14 by the which we will We excuse me by the which will we by the by the which will we are Sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ how many times how many times did he have to be offered one months that was that was nearly 2,000 years ago second temple period was that for only people who were alive then no as long as the world shall stand that was once for all that's good let's go on what does all mean well you know don't you and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering often times the same sacrifice is you ought to hear this which can never take away sins it never did and it never can it didn't take away sins in the old Covenant it didn't take away sins in the Tabernacle of the Wilderness it was only a covering for sin when Messiah came bled and died resurrected from the dead he didn't do all that to cover your sin he became the propitiation the ultimate reconciler of our sin his blood does more than cover his blood remits his blood justifies and justification just if I'd never sinned but this man God man after he had offered that was all needed because it had always been the blood of a lamb blood of a goat blood of a turtle the blood of this and that of the other now it was the blood of God now it was the blood that God specifically created for the Redemption of all the world no wonder you overcome by the blood and by the word of your testimony but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God the right hand of power and authority unless you're Tunis from henceforth expecting from that moment till now till his enemies be made his foot stol it's coming it's coming for by one offering for by one offering he hath perfected completed forever one day when this little bride is perfected are you going to be a thermometer your whole life one day when everybody gets it right I I got a feeling confessing the right thing over your life will help you a whole lot more than anything else to get it right for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are set apart them that are Sanctified we're not Sanctified by following any tradition we are Sanctified and the New Testament tells us we are Sanctified by the washing of the water of the the word that places Us in the the Waters of Separation the washing of the water of the word sanctifies us and sets us apart the blood purchases US as an agent of Grace We're purchased by the blood thank God forever more and then Sanctified set apart by the washing of the water of the word not by our natural seed it's not because of any natural seed you possess it's because to the believer we carry the Royal seed it's a seed of Faith the Royal Seed of Abraham and This Promise is good also to the Natural Seed of Abraham because we're promised that there is there shall be in the last days in the end time one new man and if the New Testament is correct I believe it has to be it simply says neither Jew nor Gentile so many would like to interpret that to me that everyone would be a Jew or become a Jew or or identify as a Jew that's not what the word says one new man neither Jew nor Gentile don't get too carried away it also says neither male nor female do I have to tell you that there's a part of you that is neither male nor female there's a part of you that is eternal and it pre-exists gender distinction don't get me wrong don't misunderstand what I'm saying as Adam was both in the beginning both male and female god reached in and separated one part from the other now what do you see I see the finished work of Calvary and let me give you a couple of quotations and close he said now in in Jesus Christ the same yesterday day and forever paragraph 18 that goes we're back to the notes now the original now the only thing I think we are now the only thing uh that a Divine gift can do is to stir your faith to that that's all the Divine gift doesn't heal you the Divine gift stir your faith uh ministers he said uh can do excuse me now the only thing that a Divine gift can do is to stir your faith to that ministers preach the gospel which is just as good as anything else could be done better now if a person can just take God at his word and see the work finished there at Calvary do you see it and accept it in their own life it's not I believe he died for everybody else I believe he paid the price for all the world you can't whip the devil on that Revelation but you can whip him on this Revelation I believe he paid the price for my full salvation he is the captain of my salvation he is the author and finisher of my faith is that right let's read that again if a person can just take God at his word and see the work finished there at Calvary and accept it in their own life that settles it right there that's all is necessary then God in his goodness after that has sent gifts besides that into the church to manifest his love and his promises to the people see what I mean but every individual must look where to Calvary there's there's where it comes from is Calvary and that's further back than one generation ago we're looking all the way back now it's just like this put the blood of Jesus Christ in a deposit box at Calvary to heal all manner of sickness and diseases and give every believer a checkbook with his name signed on the bottom of it that's that's good the only thing you have to do is and send it in for any Redemptive blessings that Jesus Christ died for you believe that he said don't be afraid are you still here the living Christ The Living Jesus Christ paragraph 39 now the thing is to get the difference between what is the spirit of God oh and the spirit of the devil woo that's a big e you're not going to listen to one message of demonology and have it all figured out oh no it's a reality like I told someone on the phone this week when God chooses you to see you don't get to choose what you see right you just are chosen to see and you know anybody in the room would volunteer to see The Good The Godly the the light angels of the Lord you know uh milk and honey flowing from the river and all the good things you can see but you don't get to only see the good you've got to see it all this week is the anniversary of a vision that I had many years ago uh being in a minecart and there were many things that God did for us in that Vision one included moving obstacles and hindrances out of our way by the authority of the spoken word what what we had accomplished with a shovel in the first place could now be accomplished by a word spoken and the and the obstacle and the hindrance had to move itself off of the track that ran through the Mind those things are powerful because they remind us of the Redemptive blessings but there there are parts of that you don't get to choose to see the the light and not the dark there are parts of that very very dis ve very uh uh dark in in the sense and and um you know negative in the sense that there were preachers who had an opportunity to go ahead and let the bride be what she was destined to be in the end time instead of holding her back and some were given an opportunity in that experience to go ahead and take the whole word take it all for our day instead of believing that some of it had already finished and had come to pass you see the spirit that brother brandom had to fight against was the days of Miracles are over the spirit that the bride is fighting against in this hour is not so very different from that Spirit we have to fight against a spirit that says the gifts are over the supernatural's done nobody's getting the Holy Ghost if you believe a prophet you've got the Holy Ghost hogwash then the devil has the Holy Ghost because the devil can tell you who's an apostle and who's a prophet who's a pastor teacher and evangelist he knows that doesn't give him the Holy Ghost come on on and uh so God in that dream extended Mercy uh to those seasoned in this thing and gave them an opportunity and and one would not would not take any kind of help and I saw him going over the edge of the minecart into total darkness you don't choose uh what you see if you want to see Angels everybody would sign up but sometimes you see Darkness first there's a realm that's more real than the one we live in it's not a million miles away it's it's moving Among Us this morning according to this message it's mov moving Among Us right now in in a different dimension than the one we're walking in because dimensions are aren't stacked on top like a lot of people have described they're parallel dimensions in this universe and that's why he tells us that one day our loved ones are going to I'm going to paraphrase it by saying they're going to move toward us and we're going to move toward them and he said meet in the middle my he said our loved ones are not very far away from us right now he said they could be identified as in this room just in another dimension than the one we're living in my my my that puts things in a little different perspective that's not out of sight out of mind and so may God grant us all to be aware of the difference between the spirit of God and what the devil's trying to do unsanctified Mercy is not a work of God it's not a work of Christ to compromise with sin to pretend to show Mercy is absolutely ridiculous unsanctified Mercy will absolutely shut you down from your spiritual giftings somebody said what does that mean that means there's a mercy that you can show that is not of God we're supposed to be extending God's mercy to all some Christians have this idea because I'm a Christian I have to be run over I have to be mistreated because that's my lot as a Christian I can't speak up for what's right or myself or my family now remember speaking up for your family doesn't include hitting somebody in the head with something speaking up for your family speaking hello but sometimes we show Mercy by by letting people off the hook when they don't need to be let off the hook they need to be accountable because if everybody gives everybody a pass then who would appreciate the reality of the Lord's Mercy we had a situation in Jerusalem where someone was squatting in our apartment and they refused to leave many years ago this woman she just refused to leave and she threatened to take us to law if we if we put her out and and the Lord challenged me well who wants to put someone out we have it there for believer who who wants to do something like that the Lord challenged me and he said don't show her unsanctified mercy she doesn't trust me she used to trust me she doesn't trust me anymore she's depending on what you've given her now she needs to depend on me because you may not always be there for her so what you call showing her Christian Compassion is really unsanctified mercy and the Lord said I'm calling you out now that'll that'll wake you up hello you don't have to always lay lay down and let somebody walk all over you to be a Christian you got to Tred a time or two usually you got to forgive but sometimes we have to call people out and and attention and say wait a minute wait a minute net this is a little bit over the top I think sometime people don't understand that this is not a catchall place I'm not interested in just filling up a Pew it never was about that it didn't start out to be that I don't ever want it to become that am if we wanted to fill up every Pew all we would have to do is start giving out food once a week and we could fill up the Pew by having Pantry for people God has certainly called Ministries to do that and to serve people but this is not a catchall there's a specific work that's being done here that doesn't make it greater than any other place even though it is that doesn't make it any greater than any other place it just means it has a specific calling and if this is not the place where God's doing it I'd like to know where the place is hallelujah thank God there are many places thank God he's moving all over the world he he is for those who won't deny the word thank God for your name at the bottom of that check amen let's go back to that quote I got to stop did that only take me five minutes wow that was a valuable five minutes now the got to get the difference between the spirit of God and what is the spirit of the devil and then by the atonement in Calvary the devil is cast outo woo and I'll assure you if the believer will come and believe right here presently no matter what's wrong with it it'll take place right here right here that's right you've never seen it fail and it won't but now if you go out of here and disbelieve or just with a little weak faith we make sure you read this it'll come right back on you even worse than what it was in the first place you know the devil wants you to lose your testimony you go out of here with a little bit of doubt you may be 100% whole you go out here with a little bit of doubt and it Delights the enemy to put symptoms back on you see I told you shouldn't have testified oh no for the unclean Spirit goes out of a man now listen that's not just demon possession disease is an unclean Spirit anxiety is an unclean spirit all right so that you don't have to be demon-possessed for the devil to go out and walk in dry places is that right he said then he returns back and if the good man of the house isn't there to keep him away you must take God at his word not your feelings but take God at his word oo your faith keeps him away oh my just refuse it remember the box of rattlesnakes don't send them to your neighbor's house that's what they do around here if they can't find you they'll just take it anybody this is a house they probably have a delivery coming this probably ain't it but it'll do that's why people post all week long anybody seen my package I got the picture of the front door but it ain't my front door brother brandom's talking about that box of rattlesnakes he said your name might be on it but it's not for you don't accept it don't sign for it send it back I don't know what you're going to do with this box of rattlesnakes but you're not leaving it here you better take it right back to the one who sent it but sir your name is on it I'm not receiving it I'm not accepting it I'm not signing for it amen he'll give you the box he'll bring it to you put your name on it he said your faith keeps him away just refuse it he will torment and Peck at your door and Haunt at your windows but just turn your head and keep on do you see it looking towards Christ and going on is that okay uh let me get another one at Thy word West Palm Beach you're you don't know how you'll get up out of that chair and get away from there tonight see you don't know how you're going to do this and how these other diseases going to be healed but at Thy word Lord yes remember this I'm going to let down the net at Thy word Lord I'm going to rise up from here I don't know how it's going to do it but at Thy word Lord that's it take God at his word and God's spoken word must will materialize and produce just exactly what it says it will listen the right mental attitude toward any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass I don't care what it is if you plant you want corn you plant corn water corn leave corn alone it'll produce corn is that right wheat will produce wheat word will produce word the promise of Salvation will produce a Christian the promise of the Holy Ghost will bring it to you the promise of Divine Healing will make you well any Divine promise of God and the Bible said that the word of God is a seed is that right Jesus said a so or so and if you'll just take it in your heart and don't dig it up every day to see how it's getting along let me check it out and see if my knee's any better today no no just give the testimony I'm Healed you can't keep digging the seat up and checking it out you got to leave it in the ground hello come on somebody saidwell I the Lord healed me and I'm going to so I'm going to go check on my seed tomorrow I'm going to I'm going to run a 5k the Lord healed you today of of arthritic knees and tomorrow you're going to run to 5K I don't believe I dig my seat up quite that quick see somebody said that's Faith no no no no no no no no not necess necessarily you can't get from the from the bed to the bathroom now but you're healed today you're going to run a marathon tomorrow 5K why don't you just see about getting from one end of the house to the other going in faith I'm Healed your knee clicking so loud it sounds like a sledgehammer somewhere uh uh uh beating around clicking popping I'm Healed I know I'm Healed I'm not running to 5K today but I know I'm Healed I'm not digging up my seed just yet it's going to stay planted he said uh just take it in your heart and don't dig it up every day to see how it's getting along just sink it in your heart and settle it walk right on that's all God will take care of the rest of it he's what oblig you don't have to obligate God God obligated himself to his word the last one musicians are coming at Thy word Lord Wood River Illinois we used to have precious friends in Wood River we've all gone on to be with the Lord now precious brother and sister Kesler who came out of the latter rain went to Brother branham's meetings in woodr and saw what God did changed their lives forever brother and sister Davenport changed their life forever brother brandom said in Wood River now I see Visions over the people this is good woo you sure did a lot of quoting today that's all right mm I see Visions over the people but I can't say they're healed until until he tells me they're healed and he can't tell I've already used this quote but I put it in this section two he can't tell till your faith actually acts faith without works this is Faith with works and your faith acting your faith attaching to the promise will bring God's word to pass you've got to this is God's order this is Bible order for the promise You' got to believe it accept it and testify it oo my my my you say I receive it now Lord and that settles it forever no matter what I feel like nothing about it I'm going to believe it anyhow Lord I believe when I pray I pray Lord I believe help thou my unbelief but Lord when we get that first part of the verse there if we if we can speak it with no doubt in our heart you promis to give us what we say we're not asking for something outside your word we're not asking to win the lottery we're not asking for Ed McMahon I guess he's dead now maybe we're not asking for the publisher sweep Stakes to knock on our door tomorrow we're asking according to your word the promises of your word you did say you would provide for our every need and we claim that promise you did say children is the healing healing is the children's bread and we're children you've called us that yours your PE your peculiar treasure let's stand together Lord we believe there are things that in our lives physical things symptoms that linger there's a root in that there's a root there sometimes we're making terrible choices and our body responds then we not only have to stand in faith we have to find the will to make better choices Lord having faith does not eliminate the the necessity of honoring this body that that you've given us Lord we are a people who have seen you move I'd say almost everyone in this room has seen a miracle we've watched what you can do we seen you heal broken backs people take off braces and run we've seen you Lord open blinded eyes unsto deaf ears Lord with these eyes you give me I've seen cancerous tumors fall off after prayer goers disappear I know you're the same God you have not changed surely your word works for a lingering headache for high blood pressure for sugar problems it's not just physical needs we have Lord we need freedom from worry and doubt anxiety and the spirit of supposition that makes us always suppose that we know what's happening what's going on what a situation is when sometimes we just don't really get it regardless of what linger and weighs us down and hinders us Lord we believe that taking your word using faith we can speak to every bit of it and it has to go we speak to confusion to memory loss all of these things that trouble your people we we speak to them believing that you have provided you don't have to die again you don't have to do anything else you've provided for healing in the atonement for calm nerves in the atonement OCD can't stand autism all of its many variations on the scale none of that can stand your word promised us wholeness and healing depression is a is a destiny robber it can't come from anywhere but the thief we know Lord that that by Your Word we have authority over that insecurities and inferiorities and some of us need Deliverance of our overactive imaginations father we just want to be whole people we we're not wanting to be Fanatics unless it's for you we don't mind being a nut as long as we're threaded to the right bolt and that would be you Lord we don't mind what the world I put put a quote in the note for for the next few Services where you your Prophet talked about those who believe in the Supernatural and take God is at his word are often identified as neurotics Lord I don't mind being a neurotic if it's that I'm taking you at your word and some of us are oppressed in our finances and if we have been faithful if we have been faithful to do our part we have every right to claim that you will multiply the seed that we have sown and open Windows of Heaven our Rah and pour out blessings that we don't have room enough to contain we we turn our umbrellas upside down and claim the promises of God that rain down upon us we are positioning ourselves to receive Vital Inheritance in every area of our life Hallelujah can anybody take some Faith now and agree with that I'm claiming Bridal inheritance in every area of my life I I I'm resisting the spirit of poverty and I'm reaching for the abundance that the word has promised to the believer I don't plan to live the rest of my life from paycheck to paycheck I'm not asking to be a rich beyond my my mind's dream I'm just believing that if we are faithful in Covenant with you that you will bless the seed that we have sown if anybody tries to misunderstand that Lord I I ask you to convict their heart it's just simple promise we don't sow uh uh sparingly we we seow generously because we believe that our Harvest is proportion to our sewing there are just so many areas some of us need some peace in our homes we need some order with our children we we want to be whole in every area of our life so today we take these Divine Promises of God and once again let our faith grab a hold of them and we don't say one glorious day uh in the by and by in the Sweet By and By we say what the word says it's already paid for it's already done we stand on it hallelujah hallelujah in the name of Jesus in the name of Jesus we thank you for authority over angry moles and growths in the name of Jesus we thank you for Authority I remember asking on a Tuesday night concerning a growth on my body that had double tripled in size and uh the People Prayed and we agreed and within just a short time half of it f fell off and I could hold it in my hand and it wasn't much longer that every bit of it was gone Lord we're thanking you for authority over angry moles and growths and skin tags and and and even deeper tissue lumps and your word is greater than than any a symptom thank you Jesus hallelujah hallelujah oh my just real soft play something very very soft while our faith is being stirred for just a moment we want to take God we want to take God at his word right now Hallelujah Lord Jesus not only can you make malfunctioning kidneys function but you once showed me a table in another realm where there were shiny new organs and you said that in that last day there would be those who would reach up in faith and take a hold of a new organ for their body it's not impossible for you to give somebody new kidneys or a new liver or new lungs you created the ones we have now maybe that's too much for somebody but that's not too much for your bride a new knee a new hip Lord I'm asking you to touch eyes in this room today whose vision is not improving but seemingly getting worse you are a God who is more than able we've prayed for people who went through a healing process of walking backwards in their prescription until a day they didn't even need a pair of glasses you're the god you're the God I've seen you do dental Miracles I don't know what your people need but you do come Jesus it's not our faith in a church or our pastor or a prophet or a movement it's our faith in you that we're activating now Lord move among us move Among Us Jesus would you just put your mind right on him and just where you are just just thank him would you just thank him for his presence if you will thank him for his presence he'll come closer to you Lord I Thank You for Your Presence among us today it's no surprise that you should be here because each of us brought you with us when we came now we're gathered together increasing the magnitude of your presence Among Us corporately Lord with your stripes [Music] Hallelujah hallelu Lord I believe you tell the Lord just now I want to be one of those that takes you at your word I want my my testimony to rearrange my circumstances instead of circumstances rearranging my testimony Hallelujah I'll live and not die I will finish the work that you've called me to do tell the Lord I have no desire to check out early let me live let me be strong let me have everything I need to have until the last moment on this Earth and then come get me let me keep my right mind in the name of Jesus if you have a need I want you to slip this way for just a moment doesn't have to be for healing if you come I'm assuming you're coming with the need and though we don't identify ourselves as being needy we have needs and we're bringing them to the Lord we're coming in you know position conditioning ourselves if you knew today that bread was being handed out from this pull pit and you were hungry and you needed bread you'd line up to get it and God has more for us than a loaf of bread he has everything we have need of and we're just coming we're not coming to beg let's slip all the way in and don't fill up the aisle come all the way in across the front we are coming believing that in spite of the need whatever the the need is we remember those at home who are unable to be here Lord visit them with faith right now shorten the duration of these things somebody says it has to run its course I break that in the name of Jesus it doesn't have to run any longer than it's already run we call it down in the name of Jesus others any others Lord how wonderful it would be if every one of us received an unction of our faith to say I my need is met price is paid faith has touched the throne now the best way I know to bring us into faith is to worship come and let's sing through a worship song a little bit and then we're going to pray over these that have come with needs sometimes you got to fight for it fight in worship fight in Praise I want it I'm coming to get it Lord you promise me his right ousness he humbled himself yes and carried the
