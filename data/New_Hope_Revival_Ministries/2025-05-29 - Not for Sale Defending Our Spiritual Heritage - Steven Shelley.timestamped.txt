[0:00] This
[0:01] story of Neabboth's vineyard becomes a
[0:04] powerful metaphor for defending
[0:07] spiritual heritage because it wasn't
[0:09] just a natural vineyard that Nabboth was
[0:12] willing to die for. He said, "The Lord
[0:14] forbid it me." And he was speaking
[0:17] scripturally, "Thus sayaeth the word."
[0:20] Nabboth understood something profound.
[0:22] His vineyard wasn't merely a piece of
[0:24] property, but it was a covenant
[0:26] inheritance, a tangible link to his
[0:30] fathers and to the promises that God had
[0:33] made to generations before him. When he
[0:36] refused to sell, he was essentially
[0:38] saying, "This belongs not just to me,
[0:42] but to those who came before me and to
[0:45] those who will come after me. I am but a
[0:48] steward." That's right. You and I are
[0:51] stewards.
[0:53] We are guardians of this truth.
[0:58] We have to live for it, perhaps die for
[1:02] it.
[1:03] It parallels the importance of how God
[1:07] placed this burden on the apostle
[1:10] earnestly contending for the faith which
[1:12] was once delivered to the saints.
[1:15] This is sort of what Neabboth was
[1:17] prefiguring in the Old Testament. Like
[1:20] Neabboth's vineyard, our spiritual
[1:24] heritage, the doctrines, the practices,
[1:27] and the truths that are passed down
[1:30] through generations isn't
[1:32] ours to dispose of at will. You don't
[1:36] get to vote it in and vote it out.
[1:39] Hello. I don't get to legislate it in
[1:42] and legislate it out. That's right.
[1:44] It's for the ages. God's word never
[1:48] changes. It stands true today. If I
[1:52] build again the things that I once tore
[1:54] down, I become myself a transgressor.
[1:58] The Lord forbid it that I should sell
[2:00] this piece of land to you. Nabboth's
[2:03] refusal wasn't mere stubbornness. It was
[2:05] spiritual stewardship. Yes. He
[2:08] symbolized by his action a righteous
[2:11] remnant who refuse to sell out. Brother,
[2:15] you better be part of that remnant as we
[2:18] go through 2025. Not for sale. Not for
[2:21] sale. Not for sale. You see what you
[2:25] value, you'll give yourself to. What you
[2:28] value, you'll fight for.
[2:32] What you value, you might even die for.
[2:36] What you value, you'll stand up for.
[2:39] You'll be bold. You'll be courageous
[2:41] for. You better know what you believe.
[2:45] You better believe what you believe. You
[2:48] better be willing to both live for what
[2:50] you believe and die for what you
[2:53] believe. Come on. Sometimes you have to
[2:56] stand up against the system and say,
[2:59] "I'm not for sale. I don't care if
[3:01] everybody else goes back to the beggarly
[3:03] elements of the world. I am not for
[3:06] sale. I don't care if holiness is
[3:09] outlawed, out outdated, out antiquated,
[3:12] laughed at, made fun of, mocked. I don't
[3:15] care if I'm called a pilgrim or Amish or
[3:18] whatever they say about me. I'm going to
[3:20] stay with the word. That may cost you
[3:23] your life. You better know. You better
[3:26] get everything settled in this hour
[3:28] because those powers are joining
[3:30] together, forming an image.
[3:33] They're forming an image under that
[3:34] beast. False prophet ready to operate on
[3:38] the scene. Everything can't be feel
[3:41] good.
[3:43] I want you to know it wasn't all feel
[3:44] good for Nabboth.
[3:47] Before he knew it, he was lied on,
[3:49] testified against, sentenced,
[3:53] and pounded to death for nothing
[3:58] except not for sale.
[4:01] This piece of land represented a
[4:03] generational blessing, a covenant
[4:05] promise, a divine appointment that God
[4:07] had made with his people. The Israelites
[4:09] had to die. Generations of them had to
[4:12] die to get over to inherit that land.
[4:15] How dare Nabboth even consider giving up
[4:18] quickly, surrendering quickly what
[4:22] generations before him had died to
[4:25] inherit.
[4:28] You know, how dare a a technical uh
[4:31] social media connected generation come
[4:34] around now and tell us that what we've
[4:36] stood on around this message is outdated
[4:39] and no longer relevant. If it's in the
[4:41] word,
[4:45] it's relevant.
