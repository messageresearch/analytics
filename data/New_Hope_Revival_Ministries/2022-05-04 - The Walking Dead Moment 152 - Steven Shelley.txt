Description:
When we carry a wrong spirit and nurture our woundedness and hold on to our pain, we can absolutely cut ourselves off from our place of union with Christ.  It cuts off our joy, hope and peace.  We might withdraw ourselves into a tomb and find ourselves amongst the walking dead.  We might go to church yet are no longer drinking from the Fountain of Living Water, the very Source of Life.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
there is a union there is a oneness that this word has revealed to us in this hour you can be one with him you can be one with the word and when you cut off that vital union of fellowship with him you can do nothing did you know carrying a spirit that is not christ can absolutely cut us off from our place of union with him it's happened to every one of us and so i don't even believe that it doesn't matter whether you believe it or not it's happened to every one of us we have faced situations and circumstances in life where our where somebody's action coupled with our reaction has caused us to carry a spirit that is not christ and when we carry that and nurture that and and and pour life into that instead of into our union with christ when we hold tighter to our woundedness when we hold tighter to our our pain than we do to our union with christ it absolutely cuts us off from the joy from the hope from the peace you see we're living in this hour among the walking dead we shop with the walking dead we work with the walking dead true we go to church with some who are walking dead nobody has forced them into a tube no one has forced them to live in that cold cold place but because of some circumstance or something that has happened in life they have withdrawn themselves into a into a tomb and though they walk and though they function and though they move even though they come to church sometime the hollow look in their face is a testimony that they are no longer drinking they're no longer drinking from the blood they're no longer eating flesh that's his they're no longer having communion with christ no longer abiding no longer dwelling with him you can change that you can change that today you can change that today with a made-up mind i'm going to abide in him i'm going to dwell in him i'm going to live in his word i'm going to rest in his word i'm going to feast on his word hallelujah i'm going to let his word encourage me and i'm going to let it thrill me and i'm going to let it correct me and i'm going to let it direct me made of mine
