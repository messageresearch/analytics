[0:00] To be possessed demonically is to be
[0:03] occupied from the inside. But to be
[0:06] oppressed is to be pushed down,
[0:09] squeezed, limited from the outside. This
[0:13] is the the plight of the children of God
[0:16] in the last days. We are pressed in. We
[0:20] are oppressed. There is a heaviness that
[0:23] wants to take over in our life, in our
[0:26] emotions, in our dealings with others.
[0:29] But I want you to know we don't have to
[0:31] accept that we have been called above
[0:33] the spirit of the age. As we said, we've
[0:36] been given the anointing of a flying
[0:39] eagle. Not a molting eagle, not a valley
[0:42] dwelling eagle, but one who has taken
[0:45] his position, his election. He knows who
[0:48] he is. And the fourth living creature is
[0:51] that flying eagle. I I notice that uh
[0:55] when John was describing these four
[0:58] living creatures, he didn't say one was
[1:00] a walking man and one was a bellowing ox
[1:03] or a beast. But when it came to the
[1:05] eagle, he gave some vision, some visual,
[1:10] some action. And he said he's as of a
[1:13] flying eagle, meaning one that is
[1:15] actively soaring above. I am persuaded
[1:20] today more than ever before that God has
[1:24] made a provision. He has made a way to
[1:26] get you and I above
[1:29] above hello above all. Above every
[1:32] hardship, above every hindrance, above
[1:35] every oppression,
[1:38] above every lie, above every infirmity,
[1:42] every symptom,
[1:44] every political pressure,
[1:47] every lifethreatening situation, I'm
[1:50] persuaded God has made a way.
[1:53] Over and over and over and over again,
[1:56] he keeps making a way. He makes the
[1:58] storm a calm.
[2:01] He
[2:02] recreates what is tumultuous, what is
[2:05] raging, what is wild. And just with his
[2:09] touch, with his word, with his
[2:12] intervention,
[2:14] it becomes something entirely different.
[2:17] How can he do that? Because he's the
[2:18] creator. You see, the reality is Jesus
[2:21] doesn't sweat the small stuff.
[2:25] He doesn't get excited over waves when
[2:28] the storm is at its worst. He's as calm
[2:30] as he can be. He was still on board.
[2:33] He's still on the throne. He rebuked the
[2:37] storm, spoke peace to them.
[2:40] The Did you really realize that the
[2:43] storm he was talking
[2:46] to wasn't just the natural expression,
[2:51] it was the storm within them. Master,
[2:54] master, we
[2:56] perish. Don't you care? We thought you
[2:59] loved us. That's the storm that needs to
[3:02] be spoken to today. There's somebody
[3:04] that's going to realize before you go to
[3:06] bed tonight that a storm has risen on
[3:08] your lake
[3:09] [Music]
[3:11] and your master seems to be asleep
[3:14] because he could be doing something
[3:15] about it, but he doesn't seem to be
[3:17] doing something about it. Somebody said,
[3:19] "I was praying. Were you praying or were
[3:20] you begging?"
[3:22] Were you approaching him as an orphan or
[3:24] a son?
[3:26] I hear religious prayers sometime that
[3:29] sound more to
[3:30] me like an orphan
[3:34] desperately looking for a daddy
[3:35] warbucks,
[3:37] a little Annie somewhere that needs a
[3:40] savior,
[3:42] not a bride that has already found what
[3:44] she was looking for.
[3:46] And and the reality is you didn't find
[3:49] him. He found you. You were the one lost
[3:54] and he came looking for you. He found
[3:56] you in your sin. He found you in your
[3:58] bondage. He found you in your addiction.
[4:01] You think he's going to leave you now?
[4:03] You think he's going to forsake you now?
[4:06] Hello.
[4:09] Never. Never. Sometimes we feel trapped
[4:12] on a boat in the middle of a storm
[4:13] tossed sea. The waves of life are
[4:15] knocking us to and fro. You peer into
[4:17] the darkness hoping to see an end of the
[4:19] storm. But all you see is more gray
[4:22] skies and more gray skies and more angry
[4:25] waves. And it seems like every day a new
[4:27] element of chaos is added to the storm.
[4:31] But if you recognize that Jesus is in
[4:33] your boat, the master of the universe is
[4:36] in your vessel. He can be asleep and you
[4:39] are still safe. Yes, sir. That's good.
[4:43] I'm convinced that they could have
[4:44] pulled up a pillow.
[4:47] Yeah.
[4:51] And made it safely to the other side.
[4:53] You mean nobody praying, nobody
[4:55] rebuking, nobody taking author?
[4:57] Absolutely.
[5:00] I believe those disciples could have,
[5:02] but if they had have, you wouldn't have
[5:05] recognized ourselves in the story.
