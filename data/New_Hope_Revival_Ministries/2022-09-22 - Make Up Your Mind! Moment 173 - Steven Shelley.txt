Description:
The Bride of Jesus Christ is a thoroughbred.  She will totally line herself up with the Word.  She will ultimately overcome all discouragement and depression, every trick and obstacle the enemy has targeted her with, because she is truly built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets.  She will possess the reins of her own mind.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
sometimes i just like to ask people whose donkey are you this is why winning the mind battle is so important because the mind battle comes to accomplish two things it comes to separate you from christ and it comes to separate you from one another you see he comes to divide us from christ to isolate us from the reality of the word he comes also this mind battle this this enemy who comes to march against our mind and our thoughts he comes to divide us from god to separate us from our origin you see i came from god you understand that don't you and i'm going back to god if the enemy can separate me from my origin he separates me from my daily existence and so my relationship with christ if my relationship with christ is broken i'm no longer i'm no longer overcoming anything we must make up our mind that we're a part of a building that's being fitly framed and joined together i tell you what i delight i delight in the thought of making the enemy's plans and plots fail what you have meant to do to divide or to hinder or to keep us defeated and discouraged and depressed in every trick that you have tried to play on us i rejoice in knowing that you will ultimately be defeated and the bride of jesus christ will continue to grow up into that holy temple dedicated consecrated set apart for the sacred to the presence of the lord so you can huff and puff and try to blow the house down but what you don't don't remember sometimes is it's built on the foundation of the apostles and the prophets the bride will stand she will stand she's built on the word and the lord jesus christ is the chief cornerstone holding it locking it all together so you tell the devil you're going to possess the reins of your own mind sometime i'd just like to ask people whose donkey are you who's riding on your back how long are you going to give him a saddle to ride in how long are you going to surrender the reins of your own mind to the one that's out to destroy you make up your mind today i'm going to possess them myself i'm not on a runaway train i'm not on a runaway donkey i'm not a runaway horse no siree i'm a thoroughbred and when that word goes forth i know exactly what i must do to line myself up with that
