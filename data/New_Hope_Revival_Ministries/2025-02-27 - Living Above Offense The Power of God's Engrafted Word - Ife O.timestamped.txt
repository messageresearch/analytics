[0:00] is it really possible to live an
[0:02] unoffendable life it is but it's an
[0:05] ascended life and that doesn't mean some
[0:08] Eastern mysticism it means getting up
[0:10] above your stuff it means being who God
[0:13] called you to be and anointed you with a
[0:16] flying eagle anointing and that flying
[0:19] eagle anointing wants to lift you up
[0:22] above your hurt your father issues your
[0:26] mama issues your come on your past yes
[0:30] we got to get past our past we've got to
[0:33] deal with stinking thinking we've got to
[0:36] realize the way to win this mind battle
[0:39] is to meditate on the word of the Lord
[0:42] I'll take your Stony
[0:44] heart Hallelujah and I will engraft in
[0:49] you my Living
[0:53] Word and my Living Word transplanted
[0:56] into your life will bring renewal and
[1:00] generation to your Fallen human
[1:02] spirit and I will not just pass my word
[1:06] over you but I will make it a part of
[1:09] who you are it's an engrafted word that
[1:13] we have received so brother sister amen
[1:17] we can overcome offense and anger and
[1:22] bitterness and jealousy not because
[1:25] we're superheroes but because we have a
[1:28] word
[1:30] that has been
[1:34] engrafted it has stimulated in us a new
[1:38] kind of
[1:41] cell it has transformed us from
[1:46] needy to
[1:49] sufficient this word has what has this
[1:53] word
[1:55] has Praise His
[1:58] Name the longterm solution is to step
[2:01] back and let that engrafted
[2:04] word begin to produce healthiness and
[2:08] wholeness in your body and it can do
[2:11] that as you water the word and how do we
[2:13] water the word by coming into his
[2:15] presence it's not just hearing the
[2:17] preaching we have to do it's daily
[2:20] entering into the presence of the Lord
[2:22] by engaging the word by engaging him in
[2:26] praise and worship by visiting what we
[2:28] believe two times a week is not enough
[2:31] to remain spiritually strong and
[2:34] emotionally and mentally
[2:38] healthy did you know that the word of
[2:41] God that has been engrafted into your
[2:45] life is there to save you in the area of
[2:50] your mind your will and your
[2:54] emotions the engrafted word is working
[2:58] on you your body is preparing itself to
[3:03] receive that word that God has attached
[3:05] to
[3:06] you and if we yield to the word instead
[3:09] of our emotion if we yield to the word
[3:12] instead of our
[3:14] past if we yield to the word instead of
[3:17] our
[3:19] excuses well I've always handled it like
[3:21] that before that was
[3:23] then have you been intimate with the
[3:26] word have you opened up your life good
[3:30] question and allowed the word of God to
[3:35] overshadow your life are you willing to
[3:38] change your
[3:40] opinions your
[3:42] decisions because the word says
[3:44] something
[3:45] different you believe what you believe
[3:47] today because you came
[3:49] here
[3:52] wired to receive it because there was
[3:55] something in you there was a
[3:56] representation in you that right there
[3:59] just that ought to be enough to make you
[4:01] shout your shoes right off your
[4:04] feet the very grace of God the very
[4:07] mercy of God with tens of thousands of
[4:12] people spurning and rejecting truth
[4:15] around us God let little owe
[4:19] you hear that truth and not just say
[4:23] Amen with your tongue but say Amen with
[4:25] your life
