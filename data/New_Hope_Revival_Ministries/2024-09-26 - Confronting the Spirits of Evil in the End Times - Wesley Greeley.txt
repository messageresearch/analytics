TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we have heard it said over and over and over again that in the last age that there would be a culmination of all of the spirits of evil that had been in all of the other Church ages there would be a culmination of the evil and that we as people in the end time we would have to face those things we know that the lid of hell has been ripped off and the spirits of dark Ness that have been down Through the Ages they're just looking for something or someone uh specifically they're looking for someone to inhabit the the the spirits do not like to be disembodied they are looking for a body to dwell in we can go to the scripture and see that when those Spirits were CA cast out of the demoniac uh who was in the graveyard they wanted somewhere to go and when Jesus cast them out they asked if they could go into the swine we know that they were granted permission and they went into the swine and immediately the swine jumped off the cliff and they all drowned so where did the spirits go after that they were still looking for a body to dwell in they were still looking for someone to inhabit they wanted somewhere to go we know that that with all of these Spirits floating around those things that we cannot see but yet they try to infiltrate our mind and and on a daily basis thoughts split across our mind they're not ours yet if we're in a vulnerable place we may entertain them we may momentarily give them a place to Lodge and and they talk to us for a little while and we talk back to them in some instances we find ourselves immediately saying that's not mine get out of here there are other times it may last for some minutes and there are other times where we entertain it for days weeks months and perhaps even years but a child of God has got to recognize that there are some things that fly through through our mind but they're not ours and we immediately need to take control of them and say not today sainton it's not mine I don't I'm not going to have this and we you know we could keep the victory a whole lot better if we learned to talk back to the devil we have been told in the scripture over and over and over again fear not but I think we're intimidated or afraid sometimes to talk back to the devil when he tries to to come with a thought or an idea or something of that dark world to put in our mind and cause us to entertain it and to live it out but that's not the call of a holy ghost child of God our call is to get rid of everything that is unlike Jesus Christ and we can't just say Lord take this out of me and remain as an empty vessel we must be filled and refilled and refilled with the holy ghost power over and over again because we don't want any voids in our life because the devil is as a roaring lion he is looking for someone to inhabit he's looking for someone to take control of and all he needs is one little door to get into and we need to close off all of those doors and continually as Believers saying Lord refill me refill me any place in me when when we repent and we ask the Lord to move something out of us we immediately want to ask the Lord Fill Me Lord with your holy spirit let your life come in and inhabit that spot in me because I don't want any place in there where the enemy can have free reign in my life
