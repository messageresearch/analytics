[0:00] Listen to these words.
[0:03] You've grown
[0:06] so tired
[0:08] of the conflict,
[0:13] the pain
[0:15] and the fire and the storm.
[0:21] more.
[0:23] And sometimes
[0:25] in your doubt and confusion,
[0:31] [Music]
[0:32] you've even questioned.
[0:36] Where is
[0:38] the Lord?
[0:42] You know, I've prayed
[0:45] in the dark of the midnight
[0:53] when doubt
[0:55] was all I
[0:57] could see.
[0:59] [Music]
[1:02] moment. But while patiently
[1:05] waiting
[1:07] for morning,
[1:11] that's when I heard my Lord whisper
[1:17] to me. You know what he said? He said,
[1:22] "Indure,
[1:24] endure.
[1:25] Tell me."
[1:28] [Applause]
[1:31] I know you're fighting
[1:34] the battle,
[1:36] but you're going to win. Oh, at last.
[1:42] Hold fast. Don't you bow.
[1:47] Don't be
[1:50] endured
[1:51] [Music]
[1:52] [Applause]
[1:53] till
[1:55] the end.
[1:58] That's what the Lord said for us to do.
[2:00] Now we know that the Lord is soon coming
[2:09] because we see the prophets words coming
[2:15] true.
[2:19] Oh, and now with just a little while
[2:24] remaining,
[2:27] [Music]
[2:28] tell me what is a good soldier
[2:33] to do?
[2:36] We must endure,
[2:40] endure
[2:41] till the end.
[2:44] [Music]
[2:46] I know you are fighting a battle, but
[2:51] guess what? You're going to win. Oh, at
[2:57] last, hold fast.
[3:01] Don't you bow, don't
[3:06] endure,
[3:08] endure till the end.
[3:13] Listen one more time.
[3:16] Now we know that the Lord is soon
[3:21] coming.
[3:25] Oh, we look and we see God's prophets
[3:28] words coming true.
[3:31] [Music]
[3:34] Oh, and now with just a little while
[3:40] remaining,
[3:44] tell me what is a good soldier
[3:49] to do.
[3:52] Oh, we must endure,
[3:56] endure
[3:57] till the end.
[4:01] Yes, God.
[4:02] Oh, we're all fighting
[4:06] the battle,
[4:08] but the word said we're going to win.
[4:12] Oh, at last hold fast. Don't you bow,
[4:19] don't
[4:22] endure. Hallelujah.
[4:24] Endure till
[4:27] the end. Sing it with me last time. Oh,
[4:31] endure,
[4:33] endure
[4:35] till
[4:36] the end.
[4:40] I know we are all fighting
[4:44] battles.
[4:46] But the good news is we're going to win.
[4:50] Oh, at last. Oh, you must hold fast.
[4:55] Don't.
[4:57] God will
[4:59] endure. Hallelujah.
[5:03] He wouldn't tell you to endure if he
[5:05] wasn't going to give you the strength to
[5:06] do it. Sing it with me again. Oh,
[5:09] endure.
[5:11] Endure
[5:13] till the end.
[5:18] I know you are all fighting such
[5:22] battles,
[5:23] but we're going to win. Oh, at last hold
[5:31] fast. Now, don't you bow
[5:40] endure
[5:42] [Applause]
[5:44] till the end.
