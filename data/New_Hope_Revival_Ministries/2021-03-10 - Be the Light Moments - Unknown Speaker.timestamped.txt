[0:00] [Music]
[0:00] that's what the holy spirit is saying in
[0:02] this hour
[0:03] let there be light
[0:14] i'm blessed when i realize that god
[0:17] is so above our intelligence
[0:20] so above our pay grade he just knew what
[0:23] he was doing before he ever got started
[0:26] and he didn't have to keep developing a
[0:28] plot change
[0:30] he didn't have to come up with a plan b
[0:32] or c or d
[0:33] or e he had to in the beginning in his
[0:36] mind plan a
[0:39] and you and i are still living in plan a
[0:44] nothing the devil can do nothing the
[0:46] devil did
[0:49] nothing he has done nothing he is doing
[0:51] nothing he will do
[0:53] will throw god's purpose into another
[0:56] plan or program
[0:58] it's all just moving along down the
[1:01] tracks
[1:02] faster than what some men want to
[1:04] recognize
[1:06] taking us this is such an individual
[1:09] moment
[1:10] this is such an individual hour
[1:13] don't you miss your opportunity
[1:17] to draw up under papa
[1:21] love on him and let him love on you
[1:24] come on now let him breathe on you
[1:28] let him squeeze you up close and let him
[1:31] whisper in your
[1:33] ear everything everything
[1:37] is going to be all right as long as you
[1:39] do what the song said
[1:41] hold on to me hold on to me
[1:45] and everything is going to be all right
[1:47] because he has a kingdom
[1:49] that is above every other kingdom
[1:52] and he has dominion in all places
[1:57] i want you to know he had dominion over
[1:59] hell
[2:00] so if he had dominion over hell you tell
[2:04] me where he doesn't have dominion
[2:06] somebody said he doesn't have dominion
[2:08] in the realms of evil
[2:10] yes he does the old testament said he
[2:13] created it
[2:16] well god is light and he doesn't have a
[2:18] real it doesn't have
[2:19] any dominion and darkness yes he does
[2:23] he hides himself in darkness bible said
[2:26] so
[2:27] and then reveals himself in light
[2:31] god said let there be light in the light
[2:33] separated
[2:34] itself from the darkness well that's
[2:36] what the holy spirit
[2:38] is saying in this hour let there
[2:41] be light he's calling the chosen
[2:45] generation
[2:46] a royal priesthood a holy nation a
[2:49] peculiar people to come forth
[2:52] from the darkness and be
[2:56] and be and be his marvelous light
[3:00] not do the works of light be the light
[3:04] because when you are the light what you
[3:07] do
[3:07] will reflect the light
