TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] now truth is chasing after you do you believe that because remember truth is a person it's not a Doctrine it's a person Lord Jesus Christ or you might say Yeshua our Messiah one in the same he's chasing us and why is he pursuing us because before the foundation of the world he knew us the Bible said so in fact the New Testament tells us I you have not chosen me and what that means is before the foundation of the world God knew you before your mother or father ever gave you your name your God already knew you before you were ever born from your mother's womb your God already knew you in fact the scripture tells us that every one of our days was already recorded in his book before we were ever born you know why that's good news to me it means that nothing in my life is ever going to take God by surprise good bad ugly he saw it before it ever came my way and not only church did he see it but he provided Grace he provided a way of Escape he saw my Temptation before I was ever born but with every Temptation he made a way of Escape for me to get out of that mess he saw it and he not only knew what I was going to face but let me remind you he knew my choice he knew that I would one day choose him in my case is an 18-month old baby when I chose the Lord but see that was my will that was my desire that was something stirring on the inside of me and I didn't know way back then that he had already chosen me and then as that little child of about oh four five years old when I prayed that prayer at the Baptist Sunday school sung my prayer come into my heart come into my heart he did imagine that he did changed my life at 5 years old filled me with the Holy Ghost at s years old he knew he knew my life he knew the difficulty of my life he knew the hardships of my life and he provided Grace you might say he deposited Grace in my Grace account for the day that I would need to make some withdrawals has anybody in here ever needed to withdraw some Grace from your grace account Hallelujah unlike your bank account Your Grace account will never be an overdraft but that Grace is already there but I have to participate with that Grace and I have to participate with the father's plan for my life I want to tell you something God's going to win yes
