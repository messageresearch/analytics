TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer [Music] is surrendering our mind to the word that's what makes the big difference that's the great mystery right I Christ in you the hope award [Music] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen Shelley of New Hope revival ministries and I'm coming to you again today in partnership with our great friends at the gospel channel I really appreciate the fine work that the folks at the gospel channel are doing to help get the gospel I like it gospel channel good news channel to help get the good news to you even if you're already a believer you can you can certainly use some good news a reminder of truth perhaps that you have already known but I like to be reminded sometimes seems like the older we get the more often we have to be reminded about certain things so I just believe that the gospel channel is reaching people who have never committed their lives to the Lord I believe there are those who are coming to the Lord accepting salvation through Jesus Christ because of the work of the gospel channel I believe that people are able to connect share their prayer requests and have somebody to come alongside of them and join faith with them and I believe prayers are being answered all of that also a part of the gospel channel and the gospel channel gives many different ministries an opportunity to be highlighted to go forward and to do what they are called to do and we just have appreciated for so many years now the relationship that the Lord has given us with brother Eric Erickson and all of the staff at the gospel channel and we're just thankful that we're reaching out we know that people are watching because we hear from you we have phone calls that come in and emails that come in with both prayer requests and praise reports so we just say keep them coming if you'd like more of our ministry you can visit YouTube we have our own channel on YouTube and I know that you would be blessed if you subscribed and you're notified of additional content when it's added you can visit our website at revival dot o-r-g we just want to stay connected with you and we want you to know when you send in your prayer request and we print them out and we take them before the Lord we don't just forget about them I want you to know that on a daily basis I I go back through I look over the prayer requests either on the computer or the copies that we have printed out and I pray again and if there's a name attached to it I call the name out and if it's a on occasion it might be a little difficult for me to pronounce but I do the best I can and I know the Lord knows who you are and so we just feel very connected with you even though you're on the other end of this camera and I can't look through the camera and see you we feel connected and we just know that we're standing together for the good work of the Lord to continue to be done because well I don't know about you but I believe that we are getting close very close to that beautiful time of rapture when the Lord will come for his elected bride I believe that and we have so much to be thankful for in this hour I know that many are getting ready to celebrate holidays with their loved ones we have already had our American Thanksgiving and soon many will be celebrating Christmas and my family we identify with our Jewish roots with our biblical roots and I think you've heard me say before on the program that I found out some years ago that my great-grandparents were Lithuanian Jews who came to this country and for many many years they hid their Jewishness and it was just really a sovereign wonderful blessing in my life to discover many years later it explained why I have always had since I was 11 years old and I visited Israel the first time I've had such a connection with the land and with the people so at my house even though we believe with all of our hearts that Jesus is the Messiah Yeshua is our Messiah our Savior he died on the cross and shed his blood to save us to redeem us but even though we believe that we also identify with the season of dedication or the season of Hanukkah which means dedication and so in our home during the same time of the year very very close usually to when Christmas is celebrated we like the menorah and each night and we remember the goodness of God we remember that he is a provider and we remember a courage you know the story of Hanukkah is one of courage and it's one of no compromise the Greek culture was closing in on the Jewish people in fact it was they were told you can no longer worship God in your way and you can no longer keep the Sabbath you can no longer celebrate the Feast of the Lord in fact it it could be said that it was illegal to practice your Judaism your religion the only religion that the Jews knew anything about and so it was a very difficult time and thank God there were those who said you know we love living but our lives are not as valuable as protecting what we know to be the God of the Bible the truth and so there was a great army of really common men who who just raised up following Judah Maccabees and they stood against the the tyranny and the destruction of the Greek leaders that were coming in and you know there was great defilement you may remember you can read about it in the book of Maccabees which is a part of the Apocrypha but they destroyed much of the sanctuary of the temple they offered swine's blood on the altar and they stole the gold and the silver away and this family you know was responsible to lead people back into the sanctuary that had been defiled to clean it to scrub it to remove the defiled altar and stones and and to like the golden candle stick again and and and just say God lives God lives no matter what so this is something that we like to remember every year because Jesus is certainly the light of the world and we also know that many people are busy making their Christmas plans and it can be a wonderful time for families to get together share a meal but but please you know I just ask you humbly make everything you do about the Lord and lift him up no matter what the season is and for myself I wouldn't want to offend any of you but for myself I don't I don't get all carried away in the in the in the spirit of Christmas the celebration of Christmas I find that it has ended up being something that really no longer reflects what many people believed it was supposed to be about in the beginning and that is the light of the world Jesus our salvation I think people get more excited with their trees and their decorations and they're swapping presents and credit card bills and going into debt and and if Jesus ever was a part of it he certainly left out today but what I would encourage you to do during your festivity is to is to put the Lord the center of whatever it is that you do I don't say particularly that people have to do it the way we do it but I just believe that it would be really good to step away from the commercialism and the secularism of this time of year and let every season be about Jesus and you know gather your family together and tell them you know that it's all about the king of kings and the Lord of lords and he's bigger than any one day or any one celebration he's bigger than mistletoe and Santa Claus and all of that stuff that people get so excited about and see if you can get your family excited about the gospel you know I'm not trying to be religious I'm just trying to stay with the word but see if you could get your folks to be excited about the fact that we're saved you know if we've repented of our sins if we've been baptized in the lovely name of Jesus and filled with the Holy Spirit of God we are set apart from this old world and we we are about to make an exit from time into eternity we talked a lot about eternity on our recent program with you we talked about in in the scriptures when the fullness of the time had come God sent forth I can I don't know what it is but I can hardly quote that verse without getting emotional and it's because it's so big what the Lord has done and Galatians 4 and verses 1 through 7 is what we read but let me just skip down even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come here here it is this is why we breathe this is why we live God sent forth his son made in such a humble and unusual way the Bible said made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law hallelujah that we might receive the adoption of sons this is such good news because God the word of God the Living Word of God became flesh and dwelt among us reflecting the glory of the father that we might be saved yes but he also came that we might understand by the Holy Spirit that we might sit under his tutoring even as the natural-born son of the of the Orient who though he were a born a son he wasn't much different than than the servants it tells us in verse 1 though he was really Lord of all because he had to learn what it means to operate in the authority of a son of the father and so not only did Jesus Yeshua come to save us but he came also to to give us the Holy Spirit life that we might be able to learn what it means to express the authority that comes with being a son of God remember the Bible tells us as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God and I get excited when I start talking about that and you know in our program recently we were talking about finding ourselves in a place sometimes where we feel like we don't know what tomorrow holds we are so unsure of the rest of the day we're not sure what tonight's gonna bring much less tomorrow and it can be a fearful thing when circum census of your life become so shaky and so unsure it can be such an unsettling thing even in the life of a believer and it's in that moment of uncertainty that we have to remember that God knew every one of our days before we were ever born of our mother and father here on the earth and he knew our choices both good and bad and he knew the path that we would follow both his path and at times our own path God knew that he saw that and he made provision not only for our salvation but he made provision that he might one day come and not just be a God above us or a God with us Emmanuel the Lord Jesus Christ but that by the power of the Holy Ghost he might also be God in us walking in us occupying our body this is the fullness of the adoption of sons and this really opens up a dimension of authority that we are hopefully beginning to learn beginning to understand what God wants to do in our lives here in the end time this great army of sons that are being tutored that are being trained better being prepared this little bride of Jesus Christ you said a great army she is indeed a great army because the Lord Himself is our captain and he is great in us and so there is a remnant people that are being prepared and I just want to share some verses of Scripture with you today that will help you to to perhaps find some stability when when the ground around you is che he shot these places down these scriptures down and go back to them when you feel like hey what's going on in my crazy life how am I ever gonna get myself sorted out and pulled up by my own bootstraps to be able to go on these are verses that I find a great amount of peace and comfort in the first place I'd like to read it it's in the Book of Psalms Psalm 139 verses 12 through 17 yay the darkness hide if not from thee but the night shine if as the day the darkness and the light are both alike to thee for thou hast possessed my reigns thou has covered me in my mother's womb I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made this to me is a great promise of assurance that God my father my Creator was very much involved with my formation even in the womb of my mother he was covering me it says marvelous are thy works and that my soul right knoweth right well my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret God knew every detail of my conception and from the moment that the seed and the egg joined together in conception God was there mindful of my life that was being formed and how could he be so mindful because way before the moment of my conception he knew me he said my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect this is a very important part of this passage of Scripture and in my books all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them how precious also are thy thoughts unto me O God how great is the sum of them what a song of praise what a psalm of praise even in my mother's womb even when my substance was yet unformed and all my members every part of who I am my being was already written and recorded in your book let me read verses sixteen to you again and this time let me read it in the complete Jewish Bible by dr. David Stern this is Psalm 139 verse 16 complete Jewish Bible your eyes could see me as an embryo but in your book let me just pause for a moment not to offend but to tell you life is precious to God our Creator let me say to you that according to the scripture you were in God's view you were in his sight in your mother's womb even as an embryo even before you were born physically in the earth you had value to God and you were in his so let's always pray for the protection of the sanctity of human life let's give thanks to God that life is his creation and it is precious and that it should be valued and any society that doesn't value human life even before it is expressed in natural birth it's missing the truth of the scripture I was being formed in my mother's womb nine months before I was expressed in physical birth in the earth and God watched over me every day of that nine months watching over my formation even all my members before they were joined together and and my various systems and organs of my body began to develop I was on God's radar so to speak and so please I just encourage you be be so very careful when you are thinking about these things be very careful when you are perhaps not not being smart you know not not being concerned about the consequences of the relationship that you're in and what might come a little life that might be formed and once that little life is formed it deserves to have a chance it deserves to live out its days on on planet Earth we've got to make good choices for the sanctity of life now that might get me in trouble with some folks but I know with many of you it will not because it's just the word so back to verse 16 in the complete Jewish Bible your eyes could see me as an embryo but in your book all my days were already written Here I am just an embryo in my mother's womb but every one of my days I'm 50 years old and every one of those 50 years was written in God's book about me what I would do what I would accomplish what I wouldn't do what I would choose what I would reject who I would marry what my children would become what their names would be every bit of that recorded in God's book all my days it says were already written already known of God and already recorded in the books of heaven I take comfort in that one time I was talking with an intellectual and he said well that that that really disturbs me because then he said I feel more like a rat in an experiment somewhere with some scientists somewhere ruling my life I said oh no that's not what this is at all you're misunderstanding the point altogether what this could be if you want to call it an experiment I don't call it an experiment but if you want to call it an experiment what's the purpose of an experiment you're trying to get the results you're trying to figure out if I feed the rats certain things and let him exercise in certain ways and is this going to help prevent disease or are our increases longevity or I mean that's what an experiment would be about and then when you carefully record all the details I fed him this much and I exercised him this much and I kept him away from the other you record all that then you compile the results and so this takes a long period of time however long that the experiment you're still discovering the entire time of the experiment then you write the results down and then you publish them and I said what this is is before the experiment ever begins god knows the results he knew exactly what was going to happen and how it would be in my life he knew my strengths and my weaknesses he knew what I would choose he knew the times listen he knew the times that you and I would choose to listen to the Holy Spirit and he knew the times that we would selfishly stubbornly choose our own way and yet he loved us that's one of the things that I find comforting about these truths he said my days had been shaped before any of them existed I'm gonna read it again cuz I keep interrupting myself with commentary Psalms 139 16 complete Jewish Bible no interruption here goes your eyes could see me as an embryo but in your book all my days were already written my days had been shaped before any of them existed it wasn't that God was creating a life for us and we had no choice it was that God knew our choices he knew what direction we would go in and by what he knew about us especially that moment that we would be presented with the truth of the gospel of salvation through the Grace and blood of Jesus Christ that is the most important thing that God was watching for as our days were being recorded in his books he's watching for that moment that we will hear the truth we have a savior and how we would respond and based on our response he is signs to us an eternal destiny by our choice through his foreknowledge of us the scripture said this gives me comfort because I know that no matter what's happening to me God already saw it before what somebody said well if it wasn't pleasant why don't aren't you upset with God for not stopping it let me tell you something when you and I become secure in God's love for us we can know that whatever happens in our life is for a greater good and it is for a reason I know some people laugh at the simplicity of that truth but it gives us a place of rest that we are not alone hallelujah first of all we're not in an experiment in a mad scientist's laboratory we are children of God created by God here at this very moment in time because God ordained it to be so because as you've heard me say before there's a part of me that was contributed to me by my mother and by my father DNA genetics that determined a lot about Who I am but there my friend is a part of me that you cannot see that neither my mother nor my father had anything to do with at all that is my spirit that which was given to me by Almighty God that breath that came into me as a gift of God and that was determined what portion of that at what time would come into my life was not determined by my parents but it was determined by my loving Heavenly Father and he so knew me everything there is to know about me I tell you there are times that we can be in a crowd of people and be lonely there are times that we can long for a real confidant a real friend that we could tell everything we feel and think without discouraging them without affecting them that that's one of the things that I think about in a friendship and when I when I think I'm gonna just you know dump my sorrow or my troubles on somebody else I often think about oh I miss it sometime but I do think about the fact I don't want to stumble that person I don't want to discourage that person and so we find that many times in life we can't be completely transparent we can't share all of our thoughts and concerns and burdens because we don't want to affect someone negatively and cause them to lose sight or lose hope but there is a friend there is someone that you can pour your heart out to who already knows what you're going to say before you say it that gives me comfort it lets me know that I can say most anything to God in prayer and he is not waiting over the balcony of heaven with a big hammer to to crush my skull if I say the wrong thing he loves me he wants me to cast he in fact he said didn't he cast all your care on me for I care for you even though he already knows he longs for us to come to him pouring out our heart and then looking to him for strength looking to him for comfort for help for provision for courage for whatever we have need of there are people who love us who would listen to whatever we have to say who would give us the best advice that they could possibly offer but at the end of the day they could not provide for us what Jesus can they cannot give us what a relationship with him what intimacy in the word can produce not even a mother's love can do that for us so I'm thankful for the one who clings to me closer than any brother that's the God we serve he knows my ins and outs and ups and downs and yet he loves me the same listen to what Jeremiah said in chapter 1 verses 4 & 5 he it seems that he was describing his own life he said then the word of the Lord came unto me saying before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations now that's the high calling of God on Jeremiah's life this is the word of the Lord prophesied to him before I formed you in the belly I knew you and before you came out of your mother's womb I sanctified thee which means set you apart and ordained you to be a prophet to the nation's he was born a prophet to the nation's because this was the will of God for the life of Jeremiah another scripture that reminds us that he knows that he knows and listened to the revelation that Isaiah had about his life and ministry and I say a chapter 49 verses 1 through 5 he said listen Oh Isles unto me and hearken ye people from far the Lord hath called me from my from the womb from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name and he had made my mouth like a sharp sword in the shadow of his hand have he hid me and made me a polished shaft in his quiver hath he hid me and said unto me thou art my servant o Israel in whom I will be glorified then I said I have labored in vain I have spent my straight for naught and in vain yet surely my judgment is with the Lord and my work with my god and now saith the Lord that formed me from the womb to be his servant to bring Jacob again to him though Israel be not gathered yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord and my God shall be my street that my friend is holy boldness that my brother's sister is confidence knowing that God has placed a calling on your life and he has you may not have the assurance yet that Isaiah had but I have to believe that you and I are together today for a reason for a purpose God wanted to speak to your heart he wanted to remind you that you are not here by accident you are here at an appointed time with an appointment with a purpose God has a plan for your life we were talking about the coming of the Messiah the coming of the Savior how everything had to be in line everything had to be you know sometimes we use the expression all the ducks in a row and it was as though everything had to be an order I think I said before parents had to rise and fall leaders rise and fall kingdoms rise and fall God was getting everything about the earth to the right place economically politically in in every way the religious environment we even find in reading that if the Lord would have come years before he did if Jesus would have been born years before he was that it it would have been very very difficult for the good news of the gospel to spread in to the different empires and nations of the world as it did it took the road system of the Roman Empire it took groundwork of even systems that were evil the works of men who were out to destroy yet God used them tyrants leaders those who came to crush other men and other societies other nations and cultures and yet God used even those men to lay the groundwork to get everything in order he chose the place of his birth so meticulously if I had time I could share some of that with you he he chose every detail who the birth would be announced to what what season it would be in under a decree of taxation who do you think it was that inspired the the leader to call out for a for a census of Taxation maybe Herod maybe other leaders were thinking they're just doing their own will and way but God was in control orchestrating many many details and circumstances to get everything just right because heaven was about to come down on earth sometimes they sing the hymn silent night or oh holy night and I'm sure in in in in that little atmosphere where our Lord was born it was was somewhat quiet but I when I think about it I think of all the animals making their noises and I think about I think about Oh Herod screaming in the in his palace mad you know what the wisemen mad about all the different things that are going on and all the Roman occupation in the land and zealots were rising up and you just go through a little of it in your mind and you think oh my I don't know how quiet it was I'm not really sure how silent it was but it was holy what I love about the story of Luke and when he gives us and the other Gospels that talk about the birth of our Lord what I love about it so much is you know this was God being born in flesh he could have been born in the cleanest most beautifully decorated clinic/hospital room or whatever according to what what period of time he chose to come and be born it could have been in our day if he would have waited until now he could have been born in the Mayo Clinic but he chose the timing and he chose the place and a humble place laid in a manger where animals would be in a little cave or stable as some translated and his birth all my today the BBC CNN Fox News would would announce it to the whole world but in that day no no heavenly creature showed up to and to announce it to Herod or to any other great leader or potentate but out in a field somewhere near Bethlehem some shepherd boys we call them some shepherd men were out watching over sheep taking care of lowly sheep and all of a sudden angels appeared in the night sky and sang of the praises of God glory be to God in the highest and on earth peace goodwill toward men what a salutation what a holy announcement but it didn't take place in the courtrooms or the libraries or in the halls of great learning or in the palace of great leaders it didn't take place in Jerusalem the great city of God or Rome or other beautiful cities Alexandria and other beautiful cities of the day little Bethlehem little shepherd boys this was the plan of God no beautiful christening gown to wrap him in our royal robes just swaddling clothes cloths that had been used to wipe down the sweaty animals that were being sheltered in the cave or in the stable there he was wrapped in those dirty rags the king of all kings the lord of all lords it could have been another way it could have been any number of ways more beautiful more regal more royal it could have been in a different time a different period of history as I said a moment ago it could have been in the 21st century it could have been in the rule of Queen Victoria but God knew exactly when the fullness of the time was and that's when he chose to come and in the manner that he chose to come in again that gives me such great comfort God had it all in that blueprint those thoughts that were in his mind before the foundation of the world he watched he was involved in I don't want you to think he was just an observer he was constantly interacting with mankind throughout the Old Testament but nothing that God did in those four thousand years of covenant period could begin to match that beautiful day when God became man when the Son of God became a son of man so that we the Fallen sons of men can become the sons of God as many as are led by the spirit they are the sons of God we are sons of God born by the spirit and all a part of God's great big design and plan in this story and it goes on his life predetermined his ministry part of God's plan his suffering the accusation the trial the persecution the whipping the crown of thorns the spear in his side every detail already in the mind of God when I look back over this great love story even its resurrection even the borrowed tomb all foretold even the donkey ride into Jerusalem the week before his crucifixion all foretold because it was all a part of God's blueprint for the salvation of mankind when I look over that beautiful story I don't notice one Santa Claus I don't read of any stockings by the chimney no mistletoe no Christmas pudding no tree no flashing lights no Elf on a shelf no fruitcake I could go on and on and on and on and on none of these things that become so important to us at this season of the year were ever mentioned in the most beautiful story that has ever been told so what should our focus be as born-again sons of God our focus should be on the word we've got a lot of story to tell we've got a big story that needs to be told in great detail we've got some scriptures to share with the hopeless we need to let people know before you were ever born all your members all your days were already recorded in the in God's book in his in his thoughts about you there's so much in this word there's so much truth and strength and life and hope and deliverance in the Word of God that we never get to at surface level if we let religion dictate to us the depth of our dig in God's Word will barely scrape the surface but if you will allow the deep Spirit of God to cry out in you to rise up in you and crave and hunger and call out for truth Jesus Yeshua is truth he said I am the way the truth and the life there's so much more to know about him than just the Christmas story or what is called the Easter story he won't he did all of that and it's glorious it's wonderful it's so important and precious but he did all of that because he wanted to get inside of you he wanted to be more than the God you feared the one who dwelt above you and so he came Immanuel God word made flesh in a body a man's body man in body but God in spirit because he wanted to walk with you then he went to the cross died shed his blood buried in a borrowed tomb rose again on the third day conquering death hell in the grave so that you and I might have the inheritance of eternal life leaves the planet saying why are you grieving the angels come why are you grieving this same Jesus that you see leaving is coming in like man or we have that hope and Jesus saying as he's leaving I I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you tarry in Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high that same spirit that was in the Lord Jesus Christ it's available to you and I by the power of the Holy Spirit which by the way my friend is more than a feeling it's more than a sensation it's more than a demonstration of emotion it's the same resurrection life of Jesus Christ that desires to occupy your body in the same manner that had occupied his body this is the gift the promise that we have his plans were not just about making a beautiful place for you and I to live one day he long for fellowship he long for companionship he longed for a people that would love him with hearts full of passion and longed to be in his presence a people that would log to commune with him and to know him the scriptures reveal this desire that God had to be closer to his sons than anyone can even really imagine in our finite minds in the Old Testament as I have been quoting here earlier in the Old Testament God was above man but he not only wanted to live with them in the New Testament Immanuel God with us but he desired to live in them acts 1:8 but she shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the earth second Corinthians 6:16 and what agreement hath the temple of God with idols for ye are the Temple of the Living God as God hath said I will dwell with them I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people this is a part of God's ultimate plan being revealed that he would dwell in us and walk in us that he would be our God and that we would be his people are you are you up for that are you willing to surrender to this great plan of salvation John chapter one verses 12 through 14 but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God and the word verse 14 and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth john 14 16 and 17 and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you that's the promise this is Jesus speaking saying that father he dwells with you how in the body of our Lord but he shall be in you how by the power of the Holy Spirit couple more places Ephesians chapter 2 verses 19 through 22 now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow-citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ Himself being the chief Cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the spirit he wants to dwell in you he wants to live in you so that he can move through you one more first John chapter 4 verse 12 and 13 no man has seen God at any time if we love one another god dwelleth in US and his love is perfected in us hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in us because he hath given us of his spirit hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in us because he hath given us of his spirit what was that God was making a way to accomplish the plans that he had for us since before the foundation of the world not an afterthought but always a part of the great big plan celebrate that enjoy your family enjoy being together seeing old friends all of that is just wonderful but you've got something to celebrate he's not a baby anymore he's no longer in the manger he's no longer on the cross he's no longer standing in the mouth of an open tomb he's living in the body of believers those who hunger and thirst for righteousness if he is not living in you I won't encourage you to invite him in allow him to work the work that he has desired for your life since before you were born I just would encourage you not to be so caught up in the in the little petty trappings of talking about Jesus being the reason for the season I would encourage you to make him Lord of your life I would encourage you to get him out of the manger and find out where he really wants to be he wants to live in you by his Spirit very soon we're going into a new year on the Gregorian calendar another year of our Lord the year of our Lord 2019 we remember at a time like this there is only one life it will soon be past and it's only what is done for Christ what we do for Christ that will last and that is still the truth so would you be yielded to him as your family and friends gather around you shine like a light bulb shine like the Morning Sun let his love let his light penetrate the darkness you don't have to be politically correct and you don't have to compromise with sin just love as he loved be a light make a difference that's what you've been called to do in this our Father let your glory let your anointing let your spirit increase in the lives of your children may we grow in grace and in the knowledge of who you are and who we are in you and because you are in us I pray for the sick and the needy that you would make your presence known and your healing virtue known in their lives for the glory of God in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen thank you for sticking with me too I look to see you next time god bless you bye-bye [Music] [Applause] you
