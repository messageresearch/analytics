Description:
There are blessings we have inherited and can claim from our forefathers, blessings they have prayed down upon their children and grandchildren.  But let us also realize that there can be generational curses, things we’ve inherited from previous generations, that only a complete surrender to the Word of God can expose and deal with.  In this crucial and serious time, only the Spirit of God can get to the root of the matter in our lives and give us complete deliverance.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
he wants to speak so directly to your heart [Music] the question this morning is do you have a personal experience with the lord jesus christ because when we stand in that great day before that great light we won't be facing anybody's record but our own it won't be our heritage or our inheritance or our pedigree it will be have you been born again by the spirit of jesus christ may each of you today have your own experience with the lord and carry that heritage forward and you know you got something to go to the enemy and more about you when when you know that that thing has traveled down through the generations you can stand here today and say i claim all of my grandma's prayers all my mom and daddy's prayers i claim the life that you gave them and bless them to live i claim all the benefits and blessings that they pray down upon their children and their grandchildren but you know there's other things we inherit from our forefathers sometimes those things can only be dealt with by the word of god and by the power of the holy spirit you may not feel him but he's here he wants to speak so directly to your heart if you'll surrender your heart and allow him to he wants to cut through all the stuff he wants to cut through all the marshmallow fluff he wants to get right down to the root of the matter because we're living in such a serious time now it's time to know you got to know you've got to know that you know that you know that you've had an experience with jesus christ what is it that causes somebody to do good for a while to hold on for a while to rejoice for a while to stay in the channel of god's spirit for a while and then all of a sudden fall away and fall away and fall away and keep repeating the pattern and you know there is no great answer for that there's no perfect answer for that but i think if we had to boil it down it depends on which voice are you listening to this morning when we take god's word and we live a life of surrender to that word and we begin to speak forth that word that all of heaven begins to move in all directions to bring that word to pass not only do we not necessarily need a prayer line but god has given us the grace and the ability to be able to speak our own victory to be able to speak our own deliverance because when god fills your belly with rivers of living water he'll laugh out of you he'll express joy out of you if you give him a voice you've got to yield your mouth you've got to yield your tongue you've got to yield your voice because joy has a voice you've got to yield yourself as an instrument
