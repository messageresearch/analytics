[0:00] we're going to need absolutely
[0:02] supernatural
[0:03] intervention
[0:11] if you didn't learn anything from the
[0:13] shutdowns of 2020 and 2021
[0:16] you you might learn the next round you
[0:18] can see
[0:19] in what has happened how quickly life
[0:22] can change
[0:23] a job that you depended on gone
[0:27] restaurant owners flourishing gone
[0:32] no restaurant it just lets us see how
[0:35] how changing everything is how
[0:38] really fragile everything can be we are
[0:41] probably
[0:42] very soon coming to an hour where we are
[0:46] really going to appreciate the authority
[0:49] that comes
[0:50] when the sons are placed because our
[0:53] name on the check
[0:54] it's going to be withdrawals from the
[0:56] father's bank of eternity
[0:58] that's going to help us get through life
[1:00] until the rapture day
[1:02] so we're going to need to function in
[1:04] that authority
[1:06] and there's going to be such a pull
[1:08] among souls
[1:09] that are scattered around the world who
[1:12] need to be fed like little birds
[1:14] lifting up their heads trying to get a
[1:16] little piece of meat
[1:17] until we're going to not only need to
[1:19] make withdrawals
[1:20] from the father's bank account we're
[1:22] going to need supernatural travels we're
[1:26] going to need
[1:26] supernatural provision we're going to
[1:29] need
[1:30] absolutely supernatural intervention
[1:33] to be able to do the things we need to
[1:35] do hallelujah oh that sounds
[1:38] somebody said that just paints a dark
[1:39] picture you're seeing wrong
[1:41] you better change your glasses i don't
[1:44] see darkness
[1:45] i see a lot of light coming out of the
[1:47] bride
[1:48] i see suns getting ready to shine
[1:52] glory be to god with the spoken word
[1:56] in their mouth shifting things
[2:00] they don't even know the government
[2:01] doesn't even know the nations of the
[2:03] world don't even know
[2:04] who's changing things but things are
[2:06] changing so quickly they don't even know
[2:08] that the bride's doing a whole lot of it
[2:10] with her authority hallelujah speaking
[2:13] words of
[2:13] life and she
[2:23] you
