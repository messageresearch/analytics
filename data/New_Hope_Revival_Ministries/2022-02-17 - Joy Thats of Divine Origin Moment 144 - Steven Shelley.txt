========================================

Description:
The joy of the Lord is of divine origin, radiating forth from the One who lives within us.  That joy is not dependent upon happiness, it is our survival in the darkest of night.  It is not a luxury, it is absolutely necessary and comes by obedience to the Word of God.  We cannot allow ourselves to grieve over the past,  we must  journey on and rejoice at the goodness of God.
