ministries in Smith Station Alabama we're coming to you today again in partnership with the great folks at the gospel channel and I know that you're familiar with the Ministry of the gospel Channel and I know that many of you appreciate the programming that's available to you on this network and I am delighted to have a part I'm so thankful for the opportunity that the Lord has given us we have been in relationship with these folks for a long time and we're just thankful to stand with them I believe that God has some great things in store for us in the near future and I'd like to invite you to always pray for the gospel channel and you can pray for new hope revival ministries too we also desire your prayer but we're here to serve you and we would like to stand with you in faith believing God for your request and there are numerous ways that you can contact us with those requests there is a prayer line number that will be given to you you can email us also and if you miss a program and you would like to go back and fill in the gap a bit because sometimes we do series here on this program you can find us on YouTube and you can look for the particular episode number and we have some other material that I believe would be a great blessing to you own our YouTube channel you can even subscribe and be notified when new content is added we also have a new and exciting ministry app that you can download on your phone or your tablet and even your Smart TV if you have a Roku or Apple TV and you can watch all of the programming as well as listen to sermon recording some of them 50 and 60 years old but very very relevant for where we are living today I know that you'll be blessed by the app you can also find us on Facebook and Instagram and some of the other social media outlets just because we want to be there for you when you need us and we appreciate all of the kind words and comments that you have have given to us telling us that the program has blessed you that really is what we want to hear and we have tried to be faithful in praying with you over your prayer requests and we are always excited when we hear that the Lord has heard an answered prayer so it's an exciting time to serve the Lord there's no doubt about it there's a lot of things going on around us that look bleak and look dark but I just always say that when it's getting darker out there it has to get brighter in here and I believe that God wants us to be filled with the light the love of the Holy Spirit and I believe that He desires to draw us if we're willing to yield ourselves to him into a closer and even more intimate relationship with him this is not about religion this is about relationship when we were together the last time it seemed that the Lord just directed us in a different direction and we began to minister and pray lead folk in the prayer of repentance and salvation and we prayed for Christian believers to be encouraged and lifted up and also for healing and I believe that many of you who saw that program you joined your faith with ours and God has been faithful to meet your needs at the end of that program we started talking about a subject that I had wanted to share with you and I get the opportunity of doing that today and I guess I would just call the program see of change there's one thing for sure change is inevitable it just seems that nothing ever stays exactly the same except the Lord Jesus Christ because the Bible tells us in Hebrews 13 and 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever in other words he does not change he is constant he is steady he is faithful but our lives change and this is not always a bad thing I know that most of us are not comfortable with change once we get things kind of going along coasting like we like them the last thing we want to do is welcome a change in our life but on the other hand there are things in our life that we don't want to stay the same and so we have to learn to be able to discern the times and the seasons we need to understand how that God opens up a door at times he closes that door but another door is open and it's hard not to get disappointed when things that we have enjoyed change but I just want to encourage you by letting you know that when God closes a door sometimes we hear the expression when God closes a window he opens the door it doesn't matter to me what analogy we use the truth remains the same if God is closing a chapter something particularly in your life it is because he has something new something fresh for you and when I say that we know what the scripture said there is nothing new Under the Sun but what I mean is to be able to know when the Spirit of God is desiring to move in your life and perhaps through your life in a different way than he did in the last season I'd like for us to look at the scripture because cease and times of the Lord the times and the seasons of the Lord it's a very biblical concept and it's first introduced to us actually in the first chapter of the Bible Genesis chapter 1 and I would like to read verses 11 through 14 and God said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good God said let it be and it was according to how God had spoken it and now God blesses it and seals it by saying it was good and in verse 13 and the evening and the morning were the third day verse 14 and God said Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to divide the day from the night here is God he has spoken light in into existence he has called the light out from the mixture and now he is setting something in the heavens to divide the light and he says let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years so right here at the beginning of creation God could have ordained that it would be daylight and never be night he could have ordained that it would always be dark and that it would never be bright but instead he spoke light into existence calling it out of the darkness which we find in Hebrew is a mixture of the light in the darkness so God from the beginning of the creation see God is light and what God was doing is he was calling by his spoken word the light to come out of the mixture out of the darkness and to come forward to be what God had spoken it to be and then he created the Sun in the moon - to govern the Sun to govern the day the moon to govern the night and he designed the world and the Sun and the moon and the stars in such a way that the day would be divided it would be part day it would be part night and he used these created elements of light the Sun and the moon to set in order to establish an order of signs and seasons God said the Sun and the moon will be signs and they will be Testaments of seasons you will see the Sun in the day you will know it is day you will see the moon in the night you will know it is night and these elements that God created serve greater purposes to help us understand of course we know if we study there is that gravitational pull that the moon helps control the tides and you know God has just done it right I'm just amazed when I read about a creation when I read about plant life and animal life and and and how God creates in certain plants everything they need in animals everything they need to function as they were created to function at giving them camouflage to protect themselves from predators and I just tell you it's it's a great big wonderful world that God has created and seasons times and seasons and the evening and the morning were the first day so how do we know a day is past because there has been an evening there has been a morning now we know and so God designed it this way and then as we were ending the program we read quickly a portion of Ecclesiastes chapter 3 and and I'd like to just take time to read the eighth verses that we had set aside to read for everything there is a season this is Ecclesiastes 3:1 for everything there is a season and a time for every purpose under heaven a time to be born and the time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted a time to kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to seek and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to cast away a time to tear and a time to sew a time to keep silence and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time for war and a time for peace to everything God has given a time a purpose a season it's not easy because if I were to go down this list I would I would pick I would pick the good side I would pick the time to dance over the time to mourn I would pick the time to laugh over the time to weep maybe the time to build up over the time to break down but God was establishing in his word that in his mind and in his will everything has a season everything has a time for every purpose under heaven I believe that our lives can be so much smoother really and more peaceful it doesn't mean that we won't have controversy or or situations that disturb our peace but I believe that our life will be so much sweeter if we can learn what is this season am I to be weeping in this season or am I to be laughing am I to be mourning in this season or am I to be dancing and you say well that just seems very complicated to me well I just I just believe that it is possible for the bride of Jesus Christ to discern to know to recognize the the moment the time the season that God has us in right now and what is important in this season there may be some things that were important in the last spiritual season emphasized in fact that are not being emphasized as much in this season if they were true then they are true now and we must not compromise on truth but it seems that the Spirit of God will come to the body of Christ and give themes you know for a season you can hear three or four different ministers and they're ministering the same thing and you wonder my this is this is wonderful the next time you encounter those ministries again they're ministering similar things using their individual giftings their unique vocabularies and styles but ministering along the same thing but it's entirely different than the theme that they were ministering on the last time you were in their services some body is discerning the ebb and the flow of God seasons and gods times does that make any sense to you at all I hope it does because I believe it's time for change I believe that there are things that you and I have authority to speak change into I believe there are moments of acceleration where God wants to speed up what is happening in the realm of the Spirit and you and I want to be well we want to be cooperative we want to be actively participating in what God desires to do any sung worship leader or service leader really wants to be able to tap in to what God is trying to accomplish in the atmosphere of any particular service sometimes we're just paralyzed because we know that God desires to do something different in a service because no service is just alike and yet we feel a bit paralyzed because we're we're trying to tap in we're trying to be able to discern what is it it is it is it healing that's the Lord want us to at that very moment even though the offering hasn't been taken even though the sermon hasn't come yet is it that God wants us to in that moment call for the elders of the church let them anoint with all and lay hands on the sick is it that we should sing one more song of worship and praise what is the what is the altar service to look like is it to always be an altar call to sinners are there times that God wants to to encourage the Saints are there times that the emphasis at the end of the service should be on healing what does the Lord want to do in any given service and this is the struggle that that leadership often has when we're trying to conduct a service because I tell you we can't afford to waste a service the body of Christ needs the strength that we get when we gather in the corporate anointing and sometimes the theme of a of a song service is on the coming of the Lord and it's that is that what God would have us focus on right this moment our sometimes the song worship seems to focus on what what is happening in the heavenlies at that moment worship around the throne and discovering you know it's not just picking up a list of songs and and eeny meeny miny moe I'll sing this now and because we're trying to develop an atmosphere for the truth of God's Word to go forth and not only be preached with power but with some demonstration lives to be changed and so I just want to encourage you that I believe that the Lord would have me to speak to you and say to you announce to you that it's time for change I believe that in our local assembly in our local church God has declared to us by the Holy Spirit you are in a new season and then it becomes our responsibility what is this new season and and what should we be preaching what should we be working toward and you know even even there are strongholds and principalities and things that that need to be dealt with bondage that needs to be broken off of people's lives and I believe that even sometimes that is seasonal so to speak the Lord may come and and he may move in a certain way that he wants to help us deal with our thoughts and then he make and and inspire us to deal with our words so it's it's it's a tightrope really it's a sensitive walk we don't want to to assume we want to be led by the Spirit of God for as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are we are the sons of God so it's always been a part of God's order for time and season to be measured before there were computers and iPads and cell phones and watches and even paper and pen existed God gave us something to help us track to keep track of where we are concerning time here were the day and the night and eventually then the calendar developed and we know what month it is and we know what day of the week it is etc because if you don't know where you are you'll never be able to determine where you are going and so this is one of the things I want us to commit to prayer where are we now God says I'm ready to lead you into a season of change where are we now what what excites us in this season what what are we disappointed in in ourselves what would we like to see change what would we like to do different you know I find out when I'm in this place of contemplation I write down I I do I have I have picked up the old-fashioned way I like to I'm not a good typist but I I can manage I can use my thumbs like like the young generation can I do pretty good with that but what I'm really in a moment of contemplation really meditating and thinking I find that I write I just write it down old-fashioned paper and pen and I just write down the thoughts that come to my mind I sometimes write down things that I want to I want to do differently in my life I write down things that I want to say differently words I want to stay away from and I don't mean you know curse words but but you know just negative death talk and I write words that I want to replace some of those negative words with and so when you're in a season of discovery when you're trying to discern by the spirit where am I where am I going in this time of change it's very helpful to think on some of these things and maybe even write them down because if we can discern the season of the Lord we can know what to do and when to do it and I think that is very important because sometimes we know what we want to do what we should do but we don't know when to make the move to make the step of faith or the leap of faith without seasons we become frustrated because we find ourselves doing things in the wrong time and in the wrong season doing things at the right time doing the right things at the right time is crucial therefore the seasons of the Lord are vitally important now we don't know in the beginning of a season we don't always know the duration how long that's going to last I mean we're living in such an hour now that that sometimes we can see God doing things in rapid succession just one right after another and then then you step into that slow season where everything is dry you're just pressing with everything you've gotten barely getting through and then all of a sudden the Lord begins to lead you and reveal himself to you in fresh ways and you're running again we have to learn not to be discouraged when we are in the pressing season because as I told the church recently you know doesn't matter if you are running like the hair or creeping like the tortoise what matters is that you keep moving and that you are creeping in a season where God wants you moving slow and you are sprinting in the season that God wants you to accelerate so in other words the most important thing is learning to discover the life of Enoch who walked with God and was not for God took him when we look at that story of the life of Enoch we find that there was an emptying of Enoch Enoch was not it means he was physically called away but when we look at that expression in the Hebrew its its dual and it is also saying to us Enoch was not Enoch emptied himself of all selfish ambition Enoch emptied himself of his own will o mine his own will I'm telling you we all have a will and it's a good thing because that will that free will is what helped us to establish our relationship with the Lord he knew us by foreknowledge but he allowed us to make that choice of our will the truth is he knew our act of free will he knew our choice before we ever made it because he is an all-knowing God but he gave us the gift of will and that gift of a will self will is beautiful when it's sanctified when we're using it for the purposes of God but when that self will become stubborn will oh my does the Christian life ever get bumpy then can somebody say Amen it really gets rough when we exercise our stubborn will and so we have learn to sanctify that wheel and we have to learn to yield and I've never I've never learned how to explain to someone how to yield it's it's just not it's just not possible for me to explain to someone how to yield but I can tell you this you've got to give up now that that's easy to say but it's not always easy to do you're coming you and I are coming to a place as believers that we must lay down our wheel and say not my will even if it's a good thing even if it's a good will a good plan you're choosing for yourself we have to be willing to lay it at the feet of Jesus and say Lord I want to have a surrendered life hallelujah I want to live a laydown life that I might please you so we discover that doing things at the right time in the right season with the right spirit is crucial and therefore we we mark the spiritual seasons in in in the Jewish faith in the Hebrew perspective they look at every month on the Hebrew calendar very very carefully and they they mark things that are connected to that month for instance a color a tribe one of the tribes of Israel is connected even a part of the body is connected with that month and I know that there is a possibility of going too far on those ideas and moving in something that is more like witchcraft but I also understand that God is the one who told the children of Israel to mark the new moon and why are they marking the new moon because they are to mark the new month the new month and they are to mark that and they are to celebrate it with firstfruits and they are to know when they know when an old month has ended and a new month has began so this is a biblical concept to watch where we are to make sure that we are not just spinning our wheels because we are doing something good or doing something right but not in the season where there is grace and anointing to do that particular you know we have been we have been doing television programs now for quite a few years and let's see 1566 like like 14 years and maybe a little bit longer but we're we're in a season now where there is some grace to do it and we're seeing some results and I don't mind plowing you know I've been serving the Lord a long time and I've been plowing a long time but it sure is easier to keep plowing when you begin to see some harvest when you begin to see some fruit of your labor and you who are on the other end of this program you who are watching this program by your reaching out and sharing your request with us and telling us when God has answered prayer and letting us know that the broadcast is a blessing to you you are playing a part of encouraging us to keep pressing but you know and there was a season in there where we could just hardly do we didn't have the equipment that we needed and we could just hardly get it done and I'm not telling you that it's easy you know just because God's calling us to do something doesn't make it automatically easy but I believe that we're in the season and that's why I want to believe with all my heart that the gospel channel's outreach will expand I want to believe that before this thing is over that God will bless that little nation of Iceland and how they're reaching out across the world until every nation is being touched by the ministry that God has raised up in that tiny little place and thanks be to God we get have a part in that and it appears that we're moving in to a season where we're going to see some increase and some expansion but if it's not yet time for it then what do we do we got to keep plowing we've got to keep sowing the seed and we must be faithful if I could give you a piece of advice that I think would would really be the most important thing I could say to you as a believer I would say be faithful be consistent and be faithful because God is faithful he who promised this it's faithful to bring it to pass but we do have a responsibility to to not drag behind the purposes of God and we have a responsibility not to run ahead of the purposes of God but to walk it's a daily walk Lord what would you have me to do now what what is it that you desire who is it that you want me to touch who am i reaching out for today what what would you have us to do and you know God has blessed the little ministry in Alabama in such a beautiful way and I remember years ago and I mentioned this to you when when God began to speak to us about a telephone hook-up and and we had different families that were without churches and needed fellowship who who would call the church on the Sunday morning and we would flip a switch and they would be able to hear the audio of the service on their telephone and sometimes on a speakerphone if they had it and now we stream over the internet and God gave us the website and and and he really really used the website he sent the right one the right brother in two to create that website and to develop it in such a way that it would be able to reach out and accomplish what it's accomplishing today there was a season where that was the main and now we've come to an app on your phone a few years ago if you would have mentioned such a thing to me yes that I would have said we can't afford that we don't know how to do that we'll never be able to run something like that but but God opened the door he gave gave the inspiration he provided the finance to do it and it has been hard work our staff works tirelessly I'm telling you they they work so hard but it's the season and I love it because they're open Lord what is the next what would you lead us to next and you say well you're talking about a ministry yes I know I am but in your life in your life you know I know that there are times that God leads us to a particular Bible study group and have you ever been in something like that you just loved it and everything was going good and all of a sudden you could harder to make yourself go anymore it just changed and and you know you've got to be you've got to be the one who who seeks that out in prayer is this the enemy it's this the devil trying to keep me from from from this Bible study or is this the Lord taking some of the joy out of it and the desire out of it because he wants to separate me from that and move me in another direction oh brother Shelly you're just complicating all this well it may sound complicated in trying to explain it or express it to you but it's really just the daily surrender you're just surrendering daily Lord I lay my life down before you I desire that you pick it up and use me for your glory what would you have me to do today what would you have me to say today where would you have me to be now keeping in mind we have responsibilities and we have job job responsibilities and family responsibilities and I understand that but no matter how busy you are with life you must not be so busy that you don't have time to seek direction and instruction from the one that has called you you were born to serve the Lord born to serve the Lord I just realized and I know I do it all the time but I happened to glance up in the monitor and I'm just using my hands and and I hope I don't I mean I could tuck them under here but but it just helps me some time to be able to express myself that way so I hope it's not too distracting if it is you might have to close your eyes and listen but we're just here to to bless you we're just here because we want to encourage you that there is more than just a couple times a week sitting through a service if if you're not serving the Lord every day if you're not if you're not making connection with headquarters every day touching the heart of God every day your your going to find it ever increasingly difficult to keep the faith to keep the joy in the journey but if you will make up your mind I'm going to touch home today I'm gonna reach up to the one who called me today I'm gonna pour my love out on the one who has redeemed me today and you make that a discipline and you make it a priority in fact but you do it because you love God and you want to connect with this spirit if you'll do that you will find the daily grace you will find the daily strength that you need to journey on toward the kingdom of God I believe that with all my heart I truly do now as we said a moment ago God could have caused the Sun to shine all the time and the seasons to never change but if he did that he would never we would never know many things if he had not put the Sun and the moon in the heavens and divided the day we would know when to rest we would know when to plant we would know when to harvest what we had planted it took the dividing of the time of the day and the markers so he created seasons and we are crying out for the anointing that was on the sons of Issachar you know the Bible gives us this in first chronicles chapter 12 and verse 32 and of the children of Issachar which were men that had understanding of the times to know what Israel ought to do the heads of them were two hundred and all their brethren were at their commandment God was speaking to us about the children of Issachar having an understanding of the times to know what Israel ought to do I believe that his Holy Ghost filled believers we can know what God would have us to do and if we don't know sometimes we just have to stand still and do nothing until we get instruction the Bible talks about our Lord Jesus not doing anything unless he saw the father doing it not saying anything we could say unless he heard the father saying it that is a surrendered life that is a ministry model that every one of us even in our in our daily life ministry because remember it's not just in the pulpit or with a microphone in our hand every Holy Ghost filled believer is is called to ministry because ministry is about serving and it's about giving and like the like the like Peter and in the in the book of Acts forgive me just a moment I got a little tongue-tied here is the man sitting at the beautiful gate and he's reaching out for alms and he wants something and they said silver and gold have I none but such as I have give IV in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk and God gives us he plants in us he puts in us he gives us sometimes what we need and we're carrying that and then we encounter somebody who needs who has a need and you're reaching in to what God has given you and giving it to someone else whether it's a word of encouragement or a song of inspiration or a particular scripture that God has used to speak to you a sermon you heard or something you read and you you encounter someone and you think mine need to share that and you do that's ministry that's ministry or you take somebody by the hand and say hey let me pray for you about that let's agree right now together that is ministry you don't have to have a mailing list or a website to have a ministry God is calling us to that I think we could say that change is always on the way and that is because God is not satisfied leaving us the way he found us it is a process he is always moving changing molding shaping us like clay on the potter's wheel in fact very little stays the same in life we talked about that a moment ago Jesus is the most steady and constant and faithful thing in all of our lives and so sometimes we we don't like change sometimes it's not our favorite thing but it it is not necessary excuse me it is not necessarily change that we don't like in fact some of us often cry out to God for change but often it's the dread and the fear of the unknown sometimes the reason why we resist change it's because we're afraid of what we don't know we know what we know but we're afraid of what we don't know and the fear of the unknown will sometimes cause us to resist change leaving behind the familiar can be very stressful in our lives and that's why we want to make sure that as we walk on we're we're holding on we've got we are hand in hand with the one who loved us the most who saved us and redeemed us from a life of sin we sing the old hymn hand in and with Jesus that may sound old-fashioned to some of you but I'm telling you it's the only way to life it's the only way to journey on is to go hand in hand I feel like I just need to tell somebody change is coming whether you want it or not it's coming change is coming and so the best thing that we can do is help prepare ourselves for change God helped me be prepared for whatever is coming at me or to me around the corner the season that we're in right now is changing there's no doubt about it there's something in the realm of the Spirit that's saying to us it's time to make the change it's time to make the move I believe it's because something is coming something powerful is perhaps coming to your life perhaps God wants to make a change in your family it could be that all the tears that you have been praying shedding for your loved ones and the prayers that you've been praying that God has bottled them up the scripture tells us and it could be that that you're approaching that season where God is going to pour those prayers and tears out on the head of your loved ones and bring them to salvation through Jesus Christ and and if that is the case then you want to be in the right position you you want to be carrying the right attitude and the right spirit you want to be the peacemaker in your family for such a time as this the Bible says in Isaiah chapter 54 and verse 17 no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against the in judgment thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me sayeth the Lord why insert that verse of scripture right here because I want you to know God's got it he's got it he has the righteousness that we need to move forward in what the season holds for us we must not be afraid do not fear the Bible tells us Jesus spoke those words over and over again do not be afraid fear not because he knew that fear has the potential of causing you to miss what God has for you if you allow fear to overwhelm you in that in that moment when God steps on the scene on your behalf you can be so distracted by your own emotion that you're actually running away from God's purpose and plan instead of running toward it that's why you've got to trust him you've got to know that God has this it doesn't matter what you've been fighting against through the power of prayer and faith in Jesus name it has to fall that's what the scripture tells us it doesn't matter who's been saying what God can come and is coming and we'll come to your defense if you'll surrender your heart if you get caught up in defending yourself against the the adversary against the accusers if you get swept away in trying to defend yourself you will miss God's moment in your life he's the one who comes he's the one who will defend you if you keep your heart and your trust toward him anchored in him centered on him God said that every tongue that rises against you he would condemn it I'm believing that for you I believe there's someone watching this program that needs that very word so I'm going to read it to you I'm reading it to you and prophesying it to you from the word no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against you in judgment you shall condemn this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me sayeth the Lord this is a promise that you and I can take a hold of no matter what is coming in the next season of God's dealings in our life there's no doubt about that perhaps there's something that you were trying to do before but you just couldn't quite do it and that could be because you were doing it in your own power perhaps there's something that you've been racking your brain over trying to figure out something you've been praying about a wall that you haven't seemed to be able to climb over a situation that you haven't been able to change no matter how hard you've tried a problem that just wouldn't go away I've got a feeling that if you will take God that is promised in this hour that some of these very situations that we're suggesting or mentioning now that could be a part of what God desires to change in your life right now I believe there are things that that maybe stay the same through a season and maybe even another season comes and there are changes that it brings but then there are things that that remain the same and we keep pressing for them and believing for them because we're moving toward the perfect will of God in all of our lives there is still to this day there are lives that must be won for God souls that must be won for God and we will not do it perhaps in the absence of problems we will have our problems we will have our tests we're going to have our our trials it's just part of life they're going to be temptations that that come against us but but staying up making sure that you're not dragging behind in the Spirit of God is an important thing to look at in this hour I just want to emphasize that to you the impossibility that has held back the potential in your life and your walk with God that which has been so impossible can quickly become possible as you step forward into the change that God is calling you to in this hour if you want to see beautiful change executed in your life you may find that there are some things you have to change to make preparation for it could be that you need to focus in prayer a little more it could be that you need to spend a little more time in praise and worship a little more time searching the scriptures to hear what God would say to you through his word I don't want to I don't want to give this impression that all these things are just automatic and they fall upon us at the same time but I want to tell you that what God has got for you according to his word the heritage that he has for you the the heritage of the servants of the Lord that he has for you and the righteousness that he has laid up and prepared for you it's worth what God has for us is worth the preparation it's worth making the effort to make sure that we are tuned up that we are in tune with the sound of God's purpose for our life you know the the instruments all they make beautiful music but they can get out of tune especially those stringed instruments they can get out of tune and you have to come and and tune them and what if everybody tuned their instrument to their own ear and they didn't have the perfect pitch well then no instrument would ever be able to compliment the next and that's why there has to be a a you know there's got to be a what is the word I'm a standard there has to be a standard key that we can tune the to an a has to be an a a G has to be a G and we tuned to that may God give you grace to tune your life to tighten up the string maybe your maybe you're too tight maybe maybe you you have to loosen up a little bit in a certain area of intensity loosen up a little bit so that you can meet that standard that God has so really it's it's such a beautiful hour it really is because this is a time that we get to just say Lord I'm open I'm open to you whatever you want to do in my life just speak just show me just direct me and and I don't have to have all the answers tonight if you'll just help me make the next step I'll step out in faith to make the next step if you'll just show me what that little tiny next step is and I've found so many times through the years of my life that God works that way I like it when you get the whole book at one time you just read through it and you know you know exactly how things are going to come you get the instruction manual but that's really not a life of faith is it a life of faith is God giving you some some opening some doors for you and you stepping into those doors not knowing where where the road leads not knowing where you're going where this is leading but you just keep taking one step at a time one day at a time as God opens up more of his beautiful plan in your life I feel like this has been a bit scattered but I also feel like God is speaking to somebody and I'm willing if if there's so many that perhaps can't relate to what I'm saying but if there's one of you out there that you can relate to this season change because you've been feeling it coming and you've got a little bit of anxiety a little bit of uncertainty but you really want to be able to trust the Lord for your near future then I want to minister to you it's worth it to be able to speak to you whatever it is God has got the provision he has got the instruction you know you may be guessing what the next step is but he already knows when God looks upon your life he sees the beginning from the end and the end from the beginning and he sees everything in between and he's chosen a path for you to walk and my responsibility and your responsibility is just walk soft walk sensitive walk in prayer make sure that your heart stays connected to him let me pray for you right now father I thank you that you have such leadership by the Holy Spirit in our lives you can speak to us in the depth of who we are and lead us by your spirit it is not an audible voice most of the time that we hear but that inner leading that comes by the Spirit someone is watching this program today who desperately needs to be reminded that you have got something bigger and better perhaps in the next chapter of their life but they've got to be led and they've got to have grace to be able not to step out of your Divine Plan right now so lord I pray this very moment that you would comfort them and direct them and breakthrough on their behalf reminding them that as the season of their spiritual life changes you will be with them every step of the way lord I pray that there will come an anointing for this season whatever it is whatever it looks like as long as we know we have your grace and as long as we know your anointing is upon us fresh your mercies are new every we can walk on we can journey on we can believe on and have faith that you will see us to the end of this race we ask for this grace for this blessing thank you that you're the healer we call on you for the sick and the afflicted in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen so take this away God has got this he's got it the enemy wants us to be nervous because he knows that he can disturb our peace and place fear which is a paralyzing factor and if we if we get under that spirit of fear we're paralyzed and we won't go anywhere we won't journey on we won't move forward into the things that God has for us so I'm just asking the Lord to release every one of us from the influence of that spirit of fear let his perfect love surround you in this hour and may God give you the direction and the instruction that you're looking for in your life don't be afraid to step forward and move on to whatever it is that God has for you I really appreciate your faithfulness to watch this program and you know how to contact us and we'll be back again may the Lord richly bless you bye bye for now [Music] [Applause] [Music]
