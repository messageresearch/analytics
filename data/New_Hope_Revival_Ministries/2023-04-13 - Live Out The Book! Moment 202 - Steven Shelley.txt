Description:
The Bride is being judged and examined now in how much of our destiny book we’re walking out in this hour.  We must surrender completely and say yes to everything God asks of us.  It  takes the whole book.  We’ve got to live and walk and choose it all, so that at the end of this race, even before we receive our glorified body, we are just like Jesus Christ.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and you want to make sure that when you get to the end of this race you have yielded yourself to every thought that God had about you in the beginning [Music] we're going to be judged one day we are somebody said well no no now not remember the bride is is being judged now that's right that's exactly right it's just not over with yet and one of the things that we're being examined about right now or if you want to say judged about right now is how much of our destiny book we're walking out in this hour and you want to make sure that when you get to the end of this race you have yielded yourself to every thought that God had about you in the beginning you want to know that you have obeyed him and and you know what's so amazing is God allows us it's not all in chronological order with no hope of of taking the test again or you know going through the trial again sometimes we have to repeat the test and repeat the test until we finally pass it and then another page of of our destiny story is marked off and we move on to what God has and there are things in that story that we would choose and there are things that we would not particularly choose but we have agreed we have agreed to those things how do you know that because we're here this little bride would have never been expressed in the Earth had she not agreed she agreed to come and be expressed in such an hour as this so The Good the Bad and the Ugly we said yes to and and let me just ask you what else would you say when God asks something of you would you would you really say no I don't think so no you'd say yes because you know that it takes the whole book you gotta you gotta live it all you've got to walk through it all you've gotta you've gotta choose it all so that at the end of this race even before you have a glorified body you are just like Jesus Christ now is that worth it it's worth it if you've got loved ones that need to meet him with skin on him such an hour as this it's worth him if you've got co-workers that you love and care about and nothing is going to move for them or help them accept the Jesus with skin on you then you and I are called to be that Jesus foreign
