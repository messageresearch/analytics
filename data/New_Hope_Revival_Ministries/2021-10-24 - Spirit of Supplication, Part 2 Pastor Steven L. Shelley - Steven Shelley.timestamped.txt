[53:09] you might appreciate your seats for just
[53:11] a moment god bless you
[53:13] the presence of the lord is here
[53:16] he was here early he was here before you
[53:18] got here
[53:20] i know you brought your portion with him
[53:22] i thank you for that you've added
[53:24] already to the atmosphere but before you
[53:27] came he was already here
[53:29] and as the musicians were singing
[53:32] uh
[53:33] some of the worship and getting ready
[53:35] and making sure the keys were right the
[53:38] wonderful presence of the lord was
[53:40] already filling this room
[53:42] and he did it no doubt to greet you when
[53:45] you came
[53:47] so if you came with the right heart and
[53:49] a right spirit to worship him then you
[53:51] could already come in and feel what the
[53:53] lord was doing it was special and it
[53:56] doesn't always happen that way on a
[53:58] sunday morning but this morning it was
[54:00] you might say well it's because you've
[54:01] been out of church a couple services
[54:03] well i want you to know i've had his
[54:05] presence
[54:07] oh he meets us when we focus on him
[54:11] he's as close as the mention of his name
[54:14] my grandmother used to tell people just
[54:16] go into a room and say i love you jesus
[54:19] just said just raise your hand and say i
[54:21] love you jesus i love you jesus i love
[54:24] you jesus i love you jesus
[54:27] she said just say it just mean it from
[54:29] the bottom of your heart
[54:31] and say it as long as you want to and
[54:33] then be quiet
[54:34] and see if you can hear him in the depth
[54:37] of your heart saying i love you too
[54:41] it's not always an audible voice
[54:43] but it's a presence that says i love you
[54:46] too you're mine
[54:47] you're mine
[54:49] anyway i don't know how god works with
[54:51] you but that's how he works with me and
[54:53] i'm so thankful for it today thank you
[54:55] for all your prayers for us
[54:57] i know you were praying because many
[55:00] people texted to say we're praying for
[55:02] you i don't know if that was because you
[55:04] loved me and you wanted me to have a
[55:06] restful time or if you felt sorry for me
[55:09] for having so many toddlers with me
[55:11] i don't know what it was but i want you
[55:13] to know all was well
[55:15] and god blessed me he blessed me
[55:19] and uh i like the ocean i know some
[55:22] people don't like the ocean for many
[55:24] years of my life i didn't like the ocean
[55:27] i don't like naked people
[55:29] but i like the ocean and i like the
[55:32] beach
[55:33] and uh i know that there are off times
[55:36] and those are my favorite times
[55:39] and god gave us that
[55:41] restaurants were full
[55:43] and
[55:44] shopping places were full but the beach
[55:47] that we got planted on is one we've
[55:49] never been to before and there were
[55:51] hours and hours that i spent on the
[55:54] beach alone
[55:56] i don't know how you do that with a
[55:57] crowd of people with you but alone and i
[56:00] was looking this way
[56:02] and that way and i couldn't see anybody
[56:04] in either direction now you know that is
[56:07] that was for me it was just the lord
[56:09] he just let me have it all and uh he
[56:12] ministered to my heart and encouraged me
[56:14] and rested me and i thank him for that
[56:17] and i i appreciate your prayers for all
[56:19] of us
[56:20] and was it noisy oh yes it's noisy when
[56:23] you got uh my four
[56:25] kids are
[56:27] nearly grown you get them in a room it's
[56:29] noisy
[56:30] you add any other voices to that
[56:33] and it it gets noisier and noisier and
[56:36] if you've got any ellsworth's at all in
[56:38] the mix they all talk at the same time
[56:41] it's just a family
[56:43] and so you just have to talk you just
[56:45] jump right in there and talk to right
[56:48] brother richard you don't know if
[56:49] anybody's hearing you or not but you
[56:51] just jump in and get your say
[56:53] and it was wonderful
[56:55] and i appreciate the goodness of the
[56:56] lord and his provision i want you to
[56:59] know you had some really really fabulous
[57:02] preaching
[57:03] you did while while we were away last
[57:06] sunday morning was
[57:07] real food
[57:09] and
[57:10] i haven't finished listening to tuesday
[57:13] night but what i heard and i will i will
[57:15] i told brother greeley this morning i
[57:17] want to hear the rest of it um it was
[57:20] wonderful and i enjoyed it so much and i
[57:22] know i will when i hear the rest i sent
[57:25] josh a text joshua as his family uh
[57:29] in-law family at least calls him
[57:31] i sent him a text on sunday morning and
[57:33] i i didn't on tuesday night because i
[57:36] didn't catch it all but he did a
[57:38] marvelous
[57:39] job
[57:40] in leading worship
[57:42] anointed it was anointed
[57:44] [Music]
[57:46] the thing i like about when josh leads a
[57:49] worship he hasn't done it that many
[57:50] times is i like that he does it from his
[57:53] heart and you can feel it
[57:56] and and uh i i like i just kind of like
[57:59] the way it flows it was a real soothing
[58:02] and anointed time and i appreciated it
[58:04] so much
[58:06] the presence of the lord came in the
[58:07] house where we were staying and you just
[58:10] can't help but just worship you just
[58:12] you just can't help it
[58:14] when that atmosphere when you're near
[58:16] that atmosphere you you know i
[58:20] i hope you don't ever have to tell me
[58:22] brother greeley i hope you don't ever
[58:23] have to tell me to praise him hope you
[58:25] don't ever have to tell me to lift my
[58:27] hands if i ever get so far gone that i
[58:30] don't know to remember to lift up my
[58:31] hands would you tell me then
[58:33] but as long as i know as long as i know
[58:37] i'm going to lift my hands
[58:39] and love him he's so wonderful he's so
[58:42] worthy
[58:43] and as always when god's people go
[58:45] somewhere he gives you divine
[58:48] connections
[58:49] he sends people to you whether you want
[58:51] them or not
[58:54] sometimes you don't want them
[58:56] sometimes you just want to be quiet
[58:58] and i don't know how many times this
[59:00] week i look up here comes some some man
[59:03] walking right straight toward me as fast
[59:05] as he could come
[59:06] and strike up a conversation mostly
[59:08] older men i guess i look the part
[59:11] mostly older men and they just start
[59:13] talking to me about their life and their
[59:15] family and
[59:17] and one one man came up from he was
[59:20] visiting his family from california he
[59:22] began to tell me some tragedy that had
[59:24] struck his family and you could tell
[59:27] that he just needed to tell it he just
[59:29] needed to get it out
[59:30] and it could be the the therapy of the
[59:33] ocean was kind of drawing that out of
[59:35] him he just poured it out and i said
[59:36] lord you know how to give and provide
[59:40] that opportunity to minister even when
[59:42] we're not in ministry mode
[59:45] jesus is always present in our lives and
[59:47] i believe he shines

[1:01:06] brother branham and those brothers could
[1:01:07] have got out of that storm alive it was
[1:01:09] that difficult of a time but god had
[1:01:12] been dealing with him about the power of
[1:01:14] the spoken word had already demonstrated
[1:01:17] it to him several times
[1:01:19] and he was inspired of the spirit of god
[1:01:22] to raise up and speak to that storm and
[1:01:25] god sent that storm out the very same
[1:01:28] way that it came in just
[1:01:30] went right out and god delivered them i

[1:03:16] in fact now we're having people say why
[1:03:18] didn't you invite us why didn't you let
[1:03:21] us know we would have planned to come
[1:03:23] but when my wife and sister laura were
[1:03:26] talking and planning to do something for
[1:03:28] the young people it was not my idea let
[1:03:30] me just get that in there right away not
[1:03:33] my idea
[1:03:35] um but they wanted to do something for
[1:03:38] the young people
[1:03:39] and uh so they worked
[1:03:42] on it and then
[1:03:43] they had to convince me
[1:03:45] and they convinced me and i thought well
[1:03:48] we'll we'll just turn it into a weekend
[1:03:51] uh of the word and
[1:03:53] so friday night the young people will
[1:03:55] gather here and they will have a banquet
[1:03:58] together and there are some coming from
[1:04:00] other places
[1:04:01] uh
[1:04:03] even as far away as arizona
[1:04:05] and texas but just just one or two here
[1:04:09] i understand there's going to be a group
[1:04:11] coming down from brother gisendaner's
[1:04:13] church also brother brian hembree is
[1:04:16] bringing his family and some will be
[1:04:17] with us
[1:04:18] and so if you have an invitation to the
[1:04:21] banquet would you please let
[1:04:24] somebody know my wife or sister laurel
[1:04:27] or however you all have put that would
[1:04:29] you let them know you're coming and the
[1:04:31] reason why is because the first idea was
[1:04:34] that there would be a price for the
[1:04:36] banquet and i can't do it this time i
[1:04:38] just said i don't want to do that i
[1:04:40] don't want them to have to come and buy
[1:04:42] their meal
[1:04:43] so my wife and i are providing the food
[1:04:45] sister laurel and my wife are doing of
[1:04:47] the cooking
[1:04:48] and
[1:04:49] my wife and i are providing the food as
[1:04:51] a gift to the young people so they don't
[1:04:53] have to buy a ticket to come they just
[1:04:55] come and eat and enjoy if you haven't
[1:04:58] let them know it's real important that
[1:05:01] you do
[1:05:02] because when we do something we want to
[1:05:04] make sure there's enough for everybody
[1:05:06] that's there and if you haven't let them
[1:05:09] know you're coming would you do that
[1:05:10] today
[1:05:12] and that way we can make sure that
[1:05:14] everything we need is in place
[1:05:17] brother dwayne is going to be with us
[1:05:19] and sister heather
[1:05:20] dwayne and heather jackson and their
[1:05:22] kids they're going to be here for the
[1:05:24] entire weekend at the banquet on friday
[1:05:27] night he's going to give his testimony
[1:05:29] of how he came to the lord he was raised
[1:05:31] in the truth
[1:05:32] but like brother greeley he had to find
[1:05:34] his way to the to the god of the truth
[1:05:36] through the lord jesus christ
[1:05:39] and you will enjoy his testimony and
[1:05:41] then saturday night at six o'clock next
[1:05:43] saturday night at six o'clock we'll have
[1:05:46] a service here all are invited you're
[1:05:49] welcome no matter how old you are how
[1:05:52] young you are you're welcome

[1:06:01] where you can contribute we can have
[1:06:03] some volunteer babysitters here to help
[1:06:05] these uh uh little couples young couples
[1:06:08] have an opportunity to come together and
[1:06:10] not have to chase toddlers

[1:06:21] get in a bind we may just call on some

[1:07:13] give them some good spiritual food

[1:07:18] refreshed and strengthened to go on if

[1:07:25] the holy ghost he's still a filler

[1:07:55] god is good
[1:07:57] all the time
[1:07:59] i wanted to
[1:08:01] uh just go back and read one little
[1:08:03] thing if i can find it here
[1:08:07] that uh our brother tommy
[1:08:10] mckinstry i wished it was a little
[1:08:12] easier to find these comments but
[1:08:15] brother tommy mckinstry is a brother who
[1:08:18] pastors a body of believers in ireland
[1:08:22] when i was in ireland preaching god did
[1:08:24] a couple miraculous things in the
[1:08:27] meeting
[1:08:28] and one was he he he really touched a
[1:08:31] man who was
[1:08:32] near to insanity god really touched his
[1:08:36] life
[1:08:37] delivered him of a demonic oppression
[1:08:40] and he sat down in his right mind
[1:08:43] and it was a wonderful thing and brother
[1:08:45] tommy has shared other testimonies that
[1:08:47] took place in ireland that i was not
[1:08:49] even aware of and he's streaming our
[1:08:51] services live and he contacted me this
[1:08:54] week he said i want to thank brother
[1:08:56] shelley for praying for my little boy
[1:08:58] james we had to take james to the
[1:09:00] hospital this week but glory to our
[1:09:02] mighty savior james is well today nine
[1:09:05] years old my youngest son please pray
[1:09:07] for salvation of all my children would
[1:09:10] you do that i don't know how many
[1:09:12] children brother mckinstry has when i
[1:09:15] met him he didn't have a wife and i
[1:09:17] didn't have a wife we were young
[1:09:19] single men working for the lord so i
[1:09:21] don't know how many children he has but
[1:09:23] god touched james this week he was
[1:09:26] having a real asthma attack i believe it
[1:09:29] was and was really really suffering in
[1:09:31] the lord moved for him in a profound way
[1:09:34] that's who he is
[1:09:36] that's who he is
[1:09:38] he's good to us all the time isn't he
[1:09:41] would you turn to zechariah 12
[1:09:44] i want to read verse 10
[1:09:47] and it's going to take a moment to pull
[1:09:50] you back
[1:09:51] to your focus i
[1:09:53] i want to say this without i hope you
[1:09:56] take this in the right way
[1:09:58] if you were here last sunday morning but
[1:10:00] distracted i sure do wish you'd go back
[1:10:03] and hear what brother greeley had to say
[1:10:05] you know it's possible to be in the
[1:10:07] service and be distracted i was on the
[1:10:10] other end of the line and so i could see
[1:10:12] a lot of things that you might not have
[1:10:14] seen and i saw
[1:10:16] several people getting a real good nap
[1:10:19] right in places where i sure wish that
[1:10:21] they would have been awake to hear what
[1:10:24] the lord was saying through brother
[1:10:25] greeley now there's nothing ugly in my
[1:10:28] heart when i say that to you i say that
[1:10:31] because i want you to to receive the
[1:10:33] benefit of the word and some were quite
[1:10:36] distracted on their phones and showing
[1:10:38] the one next to them what they were
[1:10:40] seeing on their phone that might have
[1:10:41] been scripture it might have been
[1:10:43] something like that but if you find that
[1:10:46] if you look back and think back and if
[1:10:48] you realize you were distracted you got
[1:10:50] it it's right on your app all you have
[1:10:52] to do is go back and feast on the good
[1:10:54] things of the lord we don't want to miss
[1:10:56] these things we don't we want to gain
[1:10:59] all the benefit we can from god's word
[1:11:01] it's life to us
[1:11:03] zechariah 12 and verse 10 we're going to
[1:11:07] read
[1:11:11] and i will pour upon the house of david
[1:11:15] and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem
[1:11:19] the spirit of grace
[1:11:21] and of
[1:11:23] supplications
[1:11:24] and they shall look upon me
[1:11:27] whom they have pierced
[1:11:29] and they shall mourn for him as one
[1:11:32] mourneth for his only son
[1:11:35] and shall be in bitterness for him
[1:11:38] as one that is in bitterness
[1:11:41] for his
[1:11:43] first born
[1:11:46] let's pray together just a moment father
[1:11:49] how we thank you today
[1:11:52] that you are the great i am
[1:11:55] you are
[1:11:56] jesus christ the same yesterday and
[1:11:59] today and forever
[1:12:02] you never change
[1:12:04] you're the same
[1:12:06] your power is the same your ability to
[1:12:09] heal
[1:12:10] and to deliver is the same
[1:12:13] and you've given us so many blessings
[1:12:15] and benefits
[1:12:16] in the christian life
[1:12:18] and one of those great blessings is
[1:12:22] the gift to pour out our self before you
[1:12:26] in prayer
[1:12:28] we can bring all of our cares and all of
[1:12:31] our burdens all of our needs and even
[1:12:34] our thoughts
[1:12:35] and we can lay them before you in prayer
[1:12:39] knowing that you care
[1:12:42] knowing that you not only care but that
[1:12:45] you possess the ability to move on our
[1:12:48] behalf
[1:12:49] i dare say that most every person under
[1:12:52] the sound of my voice has been healed by
[1:12:55] your touch
[1:12:57] helped along the way by your strong
[1:12:59] extended hand
[1:13:01] ministered to in times of darkness or
[1:13:05] depression
[1:13:07] you have led us and guided us
[1:13:10] helped us to navigate through the storms
[1:13:13] of life
[1:13:14] we have so much to be thankful for
[1:13:18] so much to praise you for
[1:13:21] our hearts swell with gratefulness and
[1:13:24] gratitude for all that you mean to us in
[1:13:28] this hour
[1:13:30] we ask that you would come now around us
[1:13:32] and in us
[1:13:34] move in this place and through the
[1:13:36] stream to the nations of the world
[1:13:39] that you might reach to trinidad and
[1:13:42] south africa united arab emirates and
[1:13:45] across europe and many other places in
[1:13:48] the continent of africa and asia where
[1:13:50] there where people are joining in with
[1:13:53] us at this precise moment my god would
[1:13:57] you let the holy ghost minister there
[1:14:00] just like here
[1:14:02] and as we present our needs to you we
[1:14:05] lift up their needs as well come o god
[1:14:08] and be who you are
[1:14:10] in our lives manifest oh god every
[1:14:13] promise to us
[1:14:15] we stand on your word and thank you for
[1:14:17] your truth we ask this help and blessing
[1:14:20] in the name of the lord jesus christ and
[1:14:23] for his glory and the saint said
[1:14:27] amen you may be seated today do your
[1:14:30] best to give me undivided attention if
[1:14:33] you can because i want him to speak to
[1:14:36] you
[1:14:37] now we've already talked about zechariah
[1:14:40] 12.
[1:14:41] we were
[1:14:42] uh doing a series and i need to take you
[1:14:44] back there
[1:14:46] since camp meeting we were off this
[1:14:49] series and we were preaching about the
[1:14:51] anointing to overcome anything and
[1:14:55] everything i need to go back and finish
[1:14:58] uh the series on these seven offices
[1:15:03] of the holy ghost
[1:15:04] the spirit of god in our life and we
[1:15:08] have covered the first few
[1:15:11] and now we're almost to the end
[1:15:13] and if you still have that i would like
[1:15:16] to pull up the first four
[1:15:18] and just show them as a review this is
[1:15:21] we had this available to them
[1:15:24] on the date that we gave you there
[1:15:26] september
[1:15:28] i think it may have been the 21st or
[1:15:31] something where we listed the first four
[1:15:34] the spirit of life the spirit of truth
[1:15:38] the spirit of adoption and the spirit of
[1:15:42] holiness do you all see that there we
[1:15:44] put it up on that particular sunday
[1:15:46] maybe you would be able to find that the
[1:15:49] spirit of life that we talked about was
[1:15:52] a gift of the holy ghost or an office a
[1:15:55] position thank you of the holy ghost in
[1:15:58] our life to create or
[1:16:01] recreate the divine life of god in us
[1:16:06] and i don't ever get tired of reading or
[1:16:09] studying or meditating on the reality
[1:16:13] that i have been
[1:16:15] infused with the very life of the
[1:16:18] creator the divine
[1:16:20] life of god is living
[1:16:23] in the body of the believer
[1:16:26] not only in a spiritual way
[1:16:28] but the spirit of life
[1:16:31] the life of god the zoe life of god
[1:16:35] because it dwells in the inner man it
[1:16:38] has the ability to affect every part of
[1:16:41] who we are
[1:16:43] and every cell in our body can be
[1:16:46] transformed by the spirit of life that's
[1:16:48] what healing is
[1:16:50] a healing is when the spirit of god's
[1:16:53] divine life
[1:16:55] moves into an organ or a system of your
[1:17:00] body or an extremity of your body that
[1:17:03] is at disease that has lost its place of
[1:17:07] ease and it's now manifesting something
[1:17:11] that is causing you some difficulty or
[1:17:14] problem the very life of the creator can
[1:17:18] move this is what prayer helps do
[1:17:20] move the very life of the creator into
[1:17:24] that area of your body where you're
[1:17:26] suffering and i want you to know there's
[1:17:29] not a damaged cell or a broken system of
[1:17:33] your body or a deformed extremity that
[1:17:36] the spirit of life cannot move into and
[1:17:40] bring divine healing to you you see we
[1:17:43] believe
[1:17:44] that we have a promise not only for
[1:17:46] divine healing but we are believing for
[1:17:49] divine health
[1:17:51] we believe that if god can cause the
[1:17:53] children of israel to wander in the
[1:17:56] wilderness with divine health
[1:17:58] knowing they were in quite a rebellious
[1:18:01] place in their inner man and yet god
[1:18:04] visited them in such a way that disease
[1:18:07] was not allowed to dwell in their body
[1:18:10] hallelujah their eyes didn't wear out
[1:18:13] nothing about them waxed them they just
[1:18:16] moved in the strength of the lord from
[1:18:19] glory to glory i want to be so filled
[1:18:23] with the spirit of life that no death
[1:18:26] can abide i want to tell you something
[1:18:29] the prophet said in a little while so
[1:18:31] that no death can abide in the cells of
[1:18:34] this body
[1:18:35] hallelujah you all hear so many times we
[1:18:38] hear the testimony of how john g lake
[1:18:42] held those diseased cells in his hand
[1:18:46] and under a microscope they watched them
[1:18:49] die
[1:18:50] he wasn't as impressed as the observers
[1:18:52] was oh he said why is that such a marvel
[1:18:56] death and life cannot abide in the in
[1:18:59] the body of a child of god at the same
[1:19:01] time so life is present and death has to
[1:19:05] go
[1:19:06] and disease is a spirit of death uh it's
[1:19:10] working in the body to bring us to an
[1:19:12] end but i know that the spirit of life
[1:19:15] in us is there to create and to recreate
[1:19:18] the divine life of god in us
[1:19:21] then the holy ghost manifests himself as
[1:19:24] the spirit of truth
[1:19:25] and the spirit of truth in us brings us
[1:19:28] to a more perfect revelation of who god
[1:19:31] is
[1:19:32] oh we don't ever get to a place that we
[1:19:35] don't need the holy ghost to manifest
[1:19:37] himself as the spirit of truth
[1:19:39] we need truth in us and then number
[1:19:42] three the spirit of adoption
[1:19:45] and the whole series is available if you
[1:19:48] want to go back and look over any of
[1:19:49] these they're available to you there on
[1:19:52] the new hope revival ministries app
[1:19:54] the spirit of adoption works patiently
[1:19:57] in us
[1:19:59] aren't you glad
[1:20:00] until we can be called sons of knowledge
[1:20:05] the mature
[1:20:06] sons of god
[1:20:08] and then number four the holy ghost
[1:20:10] operates in us as the spirit of holiness
[1:20:14] causes our relationship to grow
[1:20:17] into the realization and revelation of
[1:20:21] his
[1:20:22] holiness
[1:20:24] we must be partakers of his
[1:20:27] righteousness and his holiness we can't
[1:20:32] produce much of it on our own
[1:20:34] but we are blessed with the ability to
[1:20:37] pull from his
[1:20:39] and it transforms us
[1:20:42] from the spirit of the world to the
[1:20:44] spirit of holiness
[1:20:46] my god we need that in this hour if you
[1:20:49] believe that same man that was the first
[1:20:52] four and then we are in the final three
[1:20:55] of the seven the spirit of grace
[1:20:58] and the spirit of grace governs the
[1:21:01] attitudes and actions of the believer
[1:21:05] who has learned to walk independence
[1:21:09] in
[1:21:10] independence not independence
[1:21:13] independence
[1:21:15] on the holy spirit
[1:21:17] you and i depend on him
[1:21:20] we need him
[1:21:23] to guide us
[1:21:24] and if we've ever needed grace
[1:21:27] we know now that we need not only grace
[1:21:30] but we need capstone
[1:21:32] grace grace
[1:21:34] we need double grace grace grace when
[1:21:38] that headstone came it came with shouts
[1:21:41] of
[1:21:42] grace grace
[1:21:45] to complete the stature of the perfect
[1:21:48] man christ there's no doubt about it and
[1:21:51] now we are on number six
[1:21:54] or 2 number two of the final three
[1:21:57] the spirit of supplication
[1:22:00] the spirit of supplication executes the
[1:22:03] office of prayer
[1:22:05] you see prayer is more than a give me
[1:22:07] list
[1:22:08] god is not santa claus
[1:22:12] prayer is not witchcraft
[1:22:14] you know it's a whole lot more than that
[1:22:17] prayer is communication
[1:22:19] how many of you know communication is
[1:22:21] not one way
[1:22:23] we're all better at talking than we are
[1:22:25] listening
[1:22:30] you say speak for yourself no i'm going
[1:22:32] to speak for all of us
[1:22:33] because even the quieter folk can
[1:22:37] can talk better than they listen
[1:22:39] because sometimes we're quiet but we're
[1:22:41] not really listening
[1:22:43] we're trying to decide what we're going
[1:22:44] to say if we get a chance to say
[1:22:46] may god help us to understand that
[1:22:49] prayer is not just about us telling god
[1:22:53] what we want him to do
[1:22:54] but it's about communication between our
[1:22:57] heart and him
[1:22:59] and it flows with ebbs and flows we cry
[1:23:02] out to him and he speaks back to us
[1:23:06] it's communication somebody say
[1:23:08] communication that's what prayer is it's
[1:23:11] not about demanding something or just
[1:23:14] petitioning god for something it's about
[1:23:16] coming into a place where we can hear
[1:23:18] god brother greeley was describing to me
[1:23:22] in my office before we came out about
[1:23:25] how he developed the message that he
[1:23:28] brought on tuesday night i don't know if
[1:23:29] he told it i don't know if he told it in
[1:23:31] the service or not but he said it was
[1:23:34] getting late in the afternoon nearly
[1:23:35] five o'clock
[1:23:36] and he still wasn't settled on what he
[1:23:39] was going to bring
[1:23:40] and he felt led to go and listen to a
[1:23:43] message am i telling too much
[1:23:45] he felt led to go and listen to a
[1:23:47] message and he kept listening he kept
[1:23:49] listening waiting on that inspiration to
[1:23:52] strike waiting on the leadership of the
[1:23:54] lord to know exactly what he would bring
[1:23:56] and how he would approach it and he said
[1:23:59] it was just like it was getting later
[1:24:01] and he was beginning to feel like you
[1:24:03] feel when you're not sure what to bring
[1:24:06] and maybe a little nervousness was
[1:24:07] coming and he said it was just like keep
[1:24:09] listening
[1:24:13] keep listening
[1:24:16] well what lord what lord keep listening
[1:24:20] see until that moment came and something
[1:24:23] in there began to speak right to him
[1:24:27] and he was able to put that together and
[1:24:29] bring it to you and give that to you
[1:24:32] that's what we need that's communication
[1:24:36] to be listening and hear the lord say
[1:24:38] well i'm listening but i'm not getting
[1:24:39] anything i'm i'm not receiving anything
[1:24:41] out of this and for the lord to speak
[1:24:43] into your inner being and say keep
[1:24:46] listening
[1:24:47] how many of you want a sensitive ear
[1:24:51] and a sensitive heart
[1:24:53] my my wouldn't you hate to turn off a
[1:24:55] message five minutes before god's diary
[1:25:01] wouldn't you hate to miss a message
[1:25:03] straight from god to your heart because
[1:25:06] you you grew impatient and you couldn't
[1:25:08] wait a few more minutes to hear what god
[1:25:10] wanted to say to you
[1:25:12] so even though brother greeley might not
[1:25:14] have been there praying our father who
[1:25:16] art in heaven that was prayer it was
[1:25:19] supplication it was communication with
[1:25:22] god god seeing his heart
[1:25:25] seeing a little bit of anxiousness
[1:25:27] coming on him because he knew the time
[1:25:30] was i've been there
[1:25:32] i know what that feels like brother if
[1:25:35] if you were if you were a real nervous
[1:25:37] person he could put you in a panic
[1:25:39] attack nearly but go oh
[1:25:42] it's not like we don't know something to
[1:25:44] talk about
[1:25:46] but there are those who really seek the
[1:25:48] lord
[1:25:50] and want to know what the spirit
[1:25:53] would say to the church
[1:25:55] because you may be up here bringing a
[1:25:57] message and look around and see that
[1:25:59] maybe two-thirds of the people aren't
[1:26:01] really even paying attention to what
[1:26:03] you're saying
[1:26:04] but god lets you find one in the crowd
[1:26:09] they may not be the loudest
[1:26:11] they may not be the most physical
[1:26:14] but something in their spirit is pulling
[1:26:17] on the gift
[1:26:19] and you recognize that god let every bit
[1:26:23] of that be said for one or two or three
[1:26:26] or four
[1:26:27] pulling because they had a need and they
[1:26:30] cared enough to exercise the gift that
[1:26:34] god has placed in your life you have a
[1:26:36] gift to pull on the gift that gift is
[1:26:39] faith
[1:26:40] god has given us faith to every man
[1:26:43] that's given a measure of faith that we
[1:26:46] might grow it
[1:26:47] that we might use it that we might
[1:26:51] exercise it and watch how faith can grow
[1:26:54] in our life so i loved hearing that
[1:26:57] testimony from him keep a little longer
[1:27:00] listen keep listening keep listening
[1:27:02] keep listening oh but lord i'm nearly
[1:27:05] done you might even come to pl i'm
[1:27:06] nearly done the message is nearly over
[1:27:09] and nothing has stood out to me that i
[1:27:12] can really bring and know that it's you
[1:27:14] keep listening
[1:27:16] boom or you pick up your bible it
[1:27:19] happens that way you read you flip
[1:27:22] you read you read you flip
[1:27:24] lord i really need something to speak to
[1:27:27] me
[1:27:29] i can read all day but i need something
[1:27:32] that'll minister to me
[1:27:34] speak directly to i feel something
[1:27:37] right here
[1:27:38] speak directly to my need and finally
[1:27:41] the lord just leads you
[1:27:43] maybe he starts directing your thoughts
[1:27:45] did you know god can lead us by
[1:27:46] directing our thoughts if we shut down
[1:27:49] our own ability to to overthink god
[1:27:52] if we'll just say i and this is why
[1:27:54] meditation is not an evil word unless
[1:27:57] it's used in an illegal way
[1:27:59] to meditate means to muse to to focus to
[1:28:03] to uh rehearse it in your heart and in
[1:28:06] your mind and in your spirit and and our
[1:28:09] biggest problem is the finding the time
[1:28:12] or let me say making the time to get
[1:28:15] quiet
[1:28:17] to get quiet before god
[1:28:20] and it means that we have to turn off
[1:28:22] sometime the out outward stimuli
[1:28:26] oh
[1:28:28] my i don't want to start there because i
[1:28:31] got a lot in my mind along the along
[1:28:33] those lines and i don't want to just go
[1:28:36] off on that because i have something i
[1:28:38] want to get to in just a moment so we
[1:28:40] thank god for the spirit of supplication
[1:28:43] it executes the office of prayer it
[1:28:46] governs the communication between our
[1:28:49] spirit and god now i believe and i
[1:28:52] preach
[1:28:53] that the communication is spirit to
[1:28:55] spirit
[1:28:56] and it's your spirit it's been infused
[1:28:59] it's been transformed
[1:29:01] by the spirit of god it's been joined to
[1:29:04] the lord as one spirit and i believe
[1:29:07] that's where real communication with him
[1:29:09] it ushers out of that
[1:29:12] not out of the realm of the mind and the
[1:29:15] will and the emotion but a deeper
[1:29:18] connection than that and i'll show you
[1:29:20] something along those lines in just a
[1:29:23] little while now when we introduced we
[1:29:25] only did one session as i recall on the
[1:29:28] spirit of supplication but we talked
[1:29:30] about prayer we mentioned a couple of
[1:29:33] different words that are used in the
[1:29:36] hebrew for prayer for supplication
[1:29:40] uh for that deep
[1:29:42] place of intercession and we will go
[1:29:45] back to that before we finish the spirit
[1:29:48] of supplication and move to the seventh
[1:29:51] the last office the spirit of glory
[1:29:54] but today
[1:29:56] i i want to i want to talk just a little
[1:29:59] bit about
[1:30:01] this
[1:30:01] this inner working how we are made it's
[1:30:05] not that we don't know
[1:30:06] we've been instructed before
[1:30:09] we've seen it in the word before but i
[1:30:12] felt like the lord was drawing me to
[1:30:14] just talk to you a little bit about this
[1:30:16] again and i pray that you will will
[1:30:19] receive something it starts in
[1:30:22] the first book of the bible bereshit
[1:30:26] or genesis
[1:30:28] it starts in the first chapter
[1:30:31] and the first verse
[1:30:33] of of the book of beginnings
[1:30:37] genesis 1 1
[1:30:39] it says
[1:30:40] in the beginning
[1:30:42] god would you read it for me
[1:30:45] created
[1:30:49] in the beginning
[1:30:51] god created
[1:30:53] the heaven
[1:30:54] and the earth
[1:30:56] so we believe that this was not millions
[1:30:59] of years
[1:31:00] apart we believe that it was a part of
[1:31:03] original creation
[1:31:05] he created the heaven lease
[1:31:08] and he created the earth
[1:31:11] and it's significant
[1:31:13] because in genesis 1 26 and 27
[1:31:18] let's refresh our mind with what those
[1:31:21] verses say
[1:31:22] and god said let us
[1:31:25] make man in our image
[1:31:28] after our likeness and let them have
[1:31:31] dominion
[1:31:32] over the fish of the sea
[1:31:35] over the fowl
[1:31:37] of the air
[1:31:38] and over the cattle
[1:31:40] and over all the earth and over every
[1:31:43] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[1:31:47] earth
[1:31:48] so god created
[1:31:50] man the next verse
[1:31:52] so god created man in his own
[1:31:56] image in the image of god created he him
[1:32:02] male and female created he them now we
[1:32:08] know these verses
[1:32:09] and we've looked at them many many times
[1:32:12] we know for sure that man is made in the
[1:32:16] image of god so what god is
[1:32:19] he made man in that same image
[1:32:22] who knows what god is god is spirit
[1:32:27] is that right
[1:32:28] he is spirit and so when god made man he
[1:32:32] made him first
[1:32:33] spirit
[1:32:35] now i know that's disputed
[1:32:37] oh even in our own ranks they all get
[1:32:41] pretty bent out of shape
[1:32:43] when we start talking about
[1:32:46] how we are made up
[1:32:48] as a triunity
[1:32:51] or a tripartite man but the bible is
[1:32:55] specific to us
[1:32:57] there are three major parts of who we
[1:32:59] are
[1:33:00] spirit
[1:33:01] soul
[1:33:02] and body
[1:33:04] and if anyone is teaching a little
[1:33:06] difference sometime brother branham
[1:33:07] would would speak about it a little
[1:33:09] differently it's because those words
[1:33:12] even in the jewish faith those words
[1:33:16] become very interchangeable
[1:33:18] and sometimes it's a little bit
[1:33:20] difficult to really know where the
[1:33:22] spirit ends and the soul has begun or
[1:33:25] where the soul begins and the flesh has
[1:33:28] begun or right back down the line
[1:33:31] but we believe what the scripture said
[1:33:34] the scripture gives us in first
[1:33:36] thessalonians chapter 5 stay with me
[1:33:39] first thessalonians 5 verse 23
[1:33:43] we believe that this is the new
[1:33:45] testament understanding of how man is
[1:33:47] made up and the very god of peace
[1:33:51] sanctify you holy and i pray god your
[1:33:55] whole
[1:33:57] spirit
[1:33:58] and soul
[1:34:00] and body
[1:34:02] now if you've got any other teaching
[1:34:04] than that don't get upset
[1:34:07] just understand that the word spirit and
[1:34:11] the word soul is very close
[1:34:15] in fact i've been told by hebrew
[1:34:17] scholars there's really no
[1:34:21] differentiation in the hebrew
[1:34:23] it's only in the english that we have
[1:34:27] such a distinct
[1:34:29] understanding of how they operate
[1:34:31] different
[1:34:32] in hebrew they believe it would be very
[1:34:35] difficult to divide spirit and soul it's
[1:34:38] just their thought and how they look at
[1:34:41] things so don't get upset if you're a
[1:34:44] person who believes that on the very
[1:34:46] inside of the inside of you is soul
[1:34:49] and then spirit and then body don't
[1:34:52] don't let it become something that
[1:34:54] causes you to miss what the lord wants
[1:34:56] to say to you today or in the future so
[1:35:00] just look at it like that words
[1:35:03] in in english
[1:35:04] like hebrew can mean many different
[1:35:07] things but first thessalonians 5 23
[1:35:11] gives us this order and i pray god
[1:35:14] your whole spirit
[1:35:17] and soul
[1:35:19] and body be preserved blameless unto the
[1:35:23] coming of our lord jesus christ how many
[1:35:26] of you see the tripartite man you see
[1:35:28] all three functions there spirit soul
[1:35:32] and body now john 4 24 you know this
[1:35:36] verse but write it down in case you need
[1:35:38] to go back and look over these notes
[1:35:40] john 4 24 says
[1:35:43] god is a
[1:35:46] spirit
[1:35:47] god is a spirit and they that worship
[1:35:51] him
[1:35:52] must worship him how
[1:35:54] in spirit
[1:35:56] and in
[1:35:58] truth
[1:36:00] if you want your worship to matter
[1:36:04] a lot of worship goes on
[1:36:07] that doesn't shift heaven
[1:36:11] a lot of noise goes on that has no
[1:36:14] effect in the heavenly whatsoever
[1:36:16] it's not even received by a loving god
[1:36:19] because god is looking for
[1:36:22] worship that operates in spirit and in
[1:36:27] truth i want you to thank god for truth
[1:36:30] truth is a person remember
[1:36:32] it's not a doctrine
[1:36:34] truth is a person so in order to worship
[1:36:37] god
[1:36:38] in spirit and in truth we have to open
[1:36:42] up our lives and allow the holy ghost to
[1:36:44] manifest himself in us as truth i want
[1:36:48] to remind you that there is no worship
[1:36:50] on the earth that affects the heavenlies
[1:36:53] like that of the bride of jesus christ
[1:36:56] the church worships and it is noticed
[1:36:59] but the bride's worship a bridal worship
[1:37:02] is like a bridal intercession it shifts
[1:37:05] and moves things in the atmosphere like
[1:37:08] no other worship like no other
[1:37:11] intercession so once you get a
[1:37:13] revelation that you are a part of the
[1:37:15] bridal paradigm you really have a pearl
[1:37:18] of great price because then you approach
[1:37:21] god in a slightly different manner
[1:37:24] because you begin to understand you were
[1:37:26] a part of him in the beginning is
[1:37:28] anybody awake this morning
[1:37:30] now look at genesis 2 7 with me just a
[1:37:33] moment and the lord god
[1:37:36] formed man
[1:37:39] i want you to see how man was formed
[1:37:42] of the dust of the ground
[1:37:46] so man was made of the earth
[1:37:52] somebody said i don't really think it
[1:37:54] was dust i think it was
[1:37:56] i think it was just what the bible said
[1:37:58] it was
[1:37:59] dust of the ground of the earth of the
[1:38:02] adamah
[1:38:04] in hebrew red dirt
[1:38:06] that's what adama means adam was named
[1:38:09] after the red dirt
[1:38:11] and the lord god formed man
[1:38:13] out of the dust of the ground and here
[1:38:16] is where the heavenly comes in
[1:38:18] the dust of the ground represented man's
[1:38:22] creation from the earthly from the dirt
[1:38:25] from the earth now here's where the
[1:38:28] heavenly comes in you see man has dual
[1:38:30] nature he
[1:38:32] carries the fingerprint of the earth and
[1:38:36] he carries the fingerprint of the
[1:38:39] heavenly the earthly and the heavenly he
[1:38:41] functions
[1:38:43] he was created to function in both
[1:38:46] realms
[1:38:50] just a moment that's powerful truth
[1:38:53] you know it but it's powerful truth
[1:38:56] because that changes prayer
[1:38:59] you don't reach up into the heavenlies
[1:39:02] as an intruder
[1:39:04] you don't move into the realm of the
[1:39:07] spirit as somebody pushing his way in
[1:39:10] you are represented in the heavenly the
[1:39:13] same way you are represented in the
[1:39:15] earthly
[1:39:16] you are made as a man as a woman from
[1:39:20] the earth and there is a part of you
[1:39:23] from the heavenly
[1:39:24] so you have this dual citizenship or
[1:39:27] dual connection
[1:39:29] both of the earth and of the spirit or
[1:39:33] of the heavenly and here's where it
[1:39:35] comes in and
[1:39:37] breathed
[1:39:38] into his
[1:39:40] nostrils
[1:39:42] the breath of life
[1:39:44] let's read that together and breathe
[1:39:48] into his
[1:39:50] the
[1:39:52] and man
[1:39:55] became a living
[1:39:58] soul
[1:40:00] he was first a body
[1:40:02] he was first flesh
[1:40:04] in the earth
[1:40:07] and then the eternal part
[1:40:10] the oldest part of who he was
[1:40:13] who he was really created to be
[1:40:16] came from the heavenly
[1:40:18] god breathed his own breath
[1:40:25] god breathed his own breath into the
[1:40:28] nostrils of man
[1:40:30] the breath of life
[1:40:32] we could say the spirit of life and what
[1:40:35] was created in man he lay there a body
[1:40:39] he received an infusion of god's spirit
[1:40:42] life by god's breath
[1:40:45] and then something was created that he
[1:40:47] didn't
[1:40:48] have he became
[1:40:52] he was created body and spirit
[1:40:56] when spirit
[1:40:58] joined with body
[1:41:00] he became
[1:41:01] a living soul
[1:41:03] he was given a mind
[1:41:06] and a will
[1:41:07] and emotions
[1:41:09] he was given five senses
[1:41:12] that allow that man to connect himself
[1:41:16] to the atmosphere
[1:41:18] and to the earth around him
[1:41:21] his spirit man is what connects him to
[1:41:24] the heavenly
[1:41:25] but it's through his soul
[1:41:27] that his body is able to find connection
[1:41:31] to the earth around us i tell you you
[1:41:33] are really really wonderfully put
[1:41:36] together
[1:41:38] god didn't want you trapped in a body
[1:41:40] that you couldn't communicate with the
[1:41:42] atmosphere around you and what goes on
[1:41:44] so he gave you mind will and emotions
[1:41:46] with five senses to do that and he
[1:41:49] joined his spirit to your spirit through
[1:41:52] the regeneration of the new birth so
[1:41:54] that you might be able to also
[1:41:56] communicate with the heavenly anytime
[1:41:58] that you need to oh my
[1:42:01] that's what prayer really is
[1:42:03] that's what communication really is it's
[1:42:06] spirit to spirit fellowship with your
[1:42:09] creator you're not praying with your
[1:42:11] mind your will and your emotions if you
[1:42:14] are you're praying religiously
[1:42:17] stay with me
[1:42:18] religion is what causes people to pray
[1:42:21] with their mind and their will and their
[1:42:24] emotions if you let your five senses
[1:42:26] dictate your prayer you're only
[1:42:28] connecting to the environment around you
[1:42:30] you're not connecting to the creator
[1:42:32] but if you let the spirit of
[1:42:33] supplication begin to operate in you by
[1:42:36] intercession by the baptism of the holy
[1:42:39] ghost then you are joined again with
[1:42:41] your creator spirit to spirit
[1:42:45] and there is no selfishness in spirit to
[1:42:47] spirit fellowship
[1:42:49] there's no emotion involved in that kind
[1:42:52] of communication how many of you are
[1:42:54] willing to admit that we often pray
[1:42:56] emotionally
[1:42:58] we get moved by our emotion and we pray
[1:43:01] out of our emotion and that's okay as
[1:43:03] long as we continue to understand
[1:43:06] there's a deeper place of prayer
[1:43:09] there's a one to one
[1:43:12] a union that is to be formed between the
[1:43:15] bridegroom and the bride a oneness a
[1:43:18] union
[1:43:20] that is to be given to the bride and the
[1:43:23] groom where prayer takes on another
[1:43:25] dimension altogether and it's not about
[1:43:28] working and striving to say the right
[1:43:31] thing anymore it's just letting the
[1:43:34] spirit man and sometimes it happens with
[1:43:36] words and sometimes it just happens with
[1:43:39] a faith pool and sometimes it happens
[1:43:42] with a language
[1:43:45] that you've never even learned on the
[1:43:47] earth
[1:43:48] but the spirit begins to groan
[1:43:54] now in in in fact
[1:43:57] this is not foreign to you
[1:44:00] i've been teaching it for years
[1:44:02] the reason why some of you look blank
[1:44:05] it's because you have yet to practice it
[1:44:09] so god is giving us another review
[1:44:13] so that we might learn there's another
[1:44:16] place in prayer for the bride of christ
[1:44:19] i'd kill my physical body
[1:44:21] if i if i strived in prayer the way that
[1:44:26] we are tempted to do sometime when we
[1:44:28] get overwhelmed with prayer request
[1:44:31] did you know you got to get up sometime
[1:44:35] you got to wash the dishes sometime
[1:44:42] somebody has to wash the dishes sometime
[1:44:46] the dishwasher
[1:44:48] whether you plug him in or you kiss him
[1:44:50] good night every night i don't know what
[1:44:52] it is
[1:44:56] the dishwasher you have to get up and go
[1:44:58] to work
[1:45:00] and yet the new testament says pray
[1:45:03] without ceasing
[1:45:06] how does somebody pray and never cease
[1:45:10] and never stop
[1:45:11] they begin to understand that there's
[1:45:14] another dimension of prayer all together
[1:45:17] you were made of the earth and you were
[1:45:20] made of the heavenly and you can pray in
[1:45:22] the earthly way mind will and emotion
[1:45:26] connecting you to your environment or
[1:45:28] you can find that place where the spirit
[1:45:31] of man
[1:45:32] transfigured
[1:45:33] transformed by his holy spirit in the
[1:45:37] new birth stays in connection
[1:45:40] and in communication with god at all
[1:45:42] times i want you to know it's your
[1:45:44] god-given right
[1:45:47] it's your privilege
[1:45:50] you can ask god
[1:45:52] anytime
[1:45:55] you can hear from god at any time
[1:45:59] the church has programmed us to believe
[1:46:02] that only certain people can hear from
[1:46:05] god
[1:46:06] then why did god give the holy ghost
[1:46:10] the holy ghost was to help you to
[1:46:12] understand you can hear
[1:46:15] from god
[1:46:18] and we have you but i'm afraid brother
[1:46:20] i'm afraid i'm afraid it won't be god
[1:46:22] aren't you glad you have an absolute
[1:46:25] word aren't you glad you can take it
[1:46:28] right back to the bible
[1:46:31] it must line up god will never tell you
[1:46:37] that's why when people come around and
[1:46:39] tell me that god is leading them to wife
[1:46:41] number three
[1:46:45] how do you know because god told me he
[1:46:48] did
[1:46:49] not
[1:46:54] he didn't
[1:46:56] god is not going to tell you anything
[1:47:00] contrary
[1:47:01] to his word
[1:47:03] if you're a widow or a widower of course
[1:47:05] these things are we're not talking about
[1:47:07] that we're talking about people moving
[1:47:10] from one to the next
[1:47:12] it's so accepted in the hour that we
[1:47:14] live in that it waters down the sanctity
[1:47:17] of marriage
[1:47:19] and it causes young people not maybe not
[1:47:22] consciously but at least subconsciously
[1:47:24] to think if i don't get it right the
[1:47:26] first time
[1:47:27] [Music]
[1:47:31] there'll be another time somebody else
[1:47:33] will love me
[1:47:35] and so forth and etcetera i don't want
[1:47:37] you get so tight
[1:47:38] unless there are some of you
[1:47:39] contemplating something you want not to
[1:47:41] be contemplating i don't know why people
[1:47:43] get so quiet it's absolutely the truth
[1:47:46] god is not going to lead you or tell you
[1:47:48] or talk to you to do something that is
[1:47:50] contrary to his word so you don't have
[1:47:53] to be afraid of his voice
[1:47:55] you just take anything you hear in the
[1:47:57] spirit even even in the spirit you take
[1:48:00] it right back to the word
[1:48:05] your spirit is not the absolute his word
[1:48:08] is the absolute
[1:48:10] so you just take it right back and see
[1:48:12] if it lines up and then you can say i've
[1:48:14] heard from god
[1:48:15] now is there forgiveness of course you
[1:48:17] know all of this yes there's forgiveness
[1:48:19] now and the lord god for man of the dust
[1:48:22] of the ground
[1:48:23] breathed into his nostrils the breath of
[1:48:26] life and man became a living soul could
[1:48:29] we look at that in the amplified
[1:48:32] it says
[1:48:34] then the lord god formed man
[1:48:38] from the dust of the ground
[1:48:40] and breathed into his nostrils the
[1:48:44] breath or spirit
[1:48:47] of life
[1:48:49] and man
[1:48:51] became a living
[1:48:54] being
[1:48:58] it was not just the body
[1:49:02] not just the spirit coming
[1:49:04] but it was spirit coming in
[1:49:08] to occupy
[1:49:09] the body
[1:49:11] that formed a connection
[1:49:14] your soul
[1:49:15] connects your spirit and your body
[1:49:19] your spirit has direct communication
[1:49:22] with god your soul allows your body to
[1:49:26] have connection with the physical
[1:49:28] environment around you and what we've
[1:49:31] got to understand as believers is that
[1:49:33] we move too much
[1:49:36] by what we have perceived in the soul
[1:49:39] mind will and emotion instead of moving
[1:49:41] by what we are picking up
[1:49:44] discerning hearing in the spirit i'll
[1:49:47] tell you
[1:49:48] most of us
[1:49:50] if we receive a signal from the soul and
[1:49:52] one from the spirit it's going to be
[1:49:54] different
[1:49:55] but this is not the will of god
[1:49:58] god is working on us
[1:50:00] i believe it was john g lake or either
[1:50:02] watchmene
[1:50:03] who said
[1:50:04] that your spirit has been saved
[1:50:08] your soul is being saved
[1:50:10] your mind will and emotions are
[1:50:12] struggling but you're getting there and
[1:50:15] your body will be saved
[1:50:17] there's not a part of you that's going
[1:50:18] to be lost
[1:50:20] salvation is for the tripartite man i'm
[1:50:23] pretty sure that was watchmen knee you
[1:50:25] can look that up if you want to
[1:50:27] understand some of these things
[1:50:29] you'd be good it bless you i know it
[1:50:31] would bless you i've recommended it
[1:50:32] before in the book called the latent
[1:50:34] power of the soul there are some very
[1:50:37] very interesting things that may not be
[1:50:39] quite the title but you can find it by
[1:50:41] that there are some interesting things
[1:50:43] that help us to understand the struggle
[1:50:46] that takes place sometime and the effort
[1:50:48] that is required to make sure we're
[1:50:51] moving out of our mind
[1:50:54] remember brother branham said you you
[1:50:56] say well i don't feel that
[1:50:59] that's from the realm of the mind the
[1:51:01] will and the emotion
[1:51:03] so he said what does that matter what
[1:51:05] does it matter what you feel
[1:51:07] he said the word goes forth and somebody
[1:51:09] said well i think such-and-such and he
[1:51:11] said what do you what does it matter
[1:51:13] what you think
[1:51:15] it's not what you think it's not what i
[1:51:17] think it's what god says
[1:51:20] right so we have to move the thinker
[1:51:24] and we have to move some of the will
[1:51:27] hopefully crucify it
[1:51:29] get it completely out of the way
[1:51:32] so that we can hear from the spirit of
[1:51:34] god
[1:51:35] he speaks to us
[1:51:37] that amplified listen i found one
[1:51:39] translation that does a really good job
[1:51:42] instead of saying and man became a
[1:51:44] living being it says and man became
[1:51:48] another speaking spirit
[1:51:55] before that only one spirit was speaking
[1:52:00] now man in god's image is made
[1:52:03] and he also has the ability to speak
[1:52:07] not only from his mind will and emotions
[1:52:09] soul realm but he has the ability
[1:52:12] because of god's breath in him the holy
[1:52:14] ghost he has the ability to speak from
[1:52:16] the spirit realm and become another
[1:52:18] speaking spirit
[1:52:20] now how many of you'd like to do a lot
[1:52:21] more talking from the from the new
[1:52:24] spirit that's been created in you
[1:52:26] than from the from the old nature
[1:52:28] from the mind from the will i hope i'm
[1:52:30] not confusing you i don't see how i
[1:52:32] possibly could be since we've gone
[1:52:34] through these things so many times
[1:52:36] before so be reminded now as we move on
[1:52:39] that man is made or created from two
[1:52:42] realms heaven and earth one part from
[1:52:44] god who is spirit the other part dust
[1:52:47] which is of the earth and this is why
[1:52:50] matthew 6
[1:52:52] 9 and 10
[1:52:54] is so important
[1:52:55] this was how we prayed this is how i
[1:52:58] pray
[1:52:59] often and have encouraged you to pray
[1:53:02] often
[1:53:03] after this manner therefore pray
[1:53:06] matthew 6 9-10
[1:53:08] our father which art in heaven hallowed
[1:53:12] holy set apart be thy name
[1:53:16] and what's next
[1:53:22] in earth
[1:53:27] in earth
[1:53:30] now we have this treasure
[1:53:33] in earth and vessels
[1:53:37] we're not just asking god's will to be
[1:53:39] done on planet earth
[1:53:42] we're asking god's will to be done in
[1:53:44] those of us who were created from earth
[1:53:47] and also from the heavenlies
[1:53:50] thy will be done in
[1:53:52] earth as it is in
[1:53:57] heaven
[1:53:58] i tell you if you don't pray in tongues
[1:54:02] you have no guarantee unless you're led
[1:54:04] by the spirit of intercession in
[1:54:07] supplication to pray the right thing but
[1:54:10] i want you to know this is the right
[1:54:12] prayer in all situations thy will be
[1:54:15] done on earth or in earth as it is in
[1:54:19] heaven you know that's really a bringing
[1:54:22] the two realms back together
[1:54:24] how many of you know that's powerful
[1:54:25] thought to bring the heavenly realm
[1:54:28] right into the earthly realm i don't
[1:54:30] know about you but i've stood in the
[1:54:31] middle i've been in a place on an
[1:54:34] occasion or two where heaven came
[1:54:36] present
[1:54:38] in earth's realm
[1:54:43] things look different
[1:54:45] when heaven is among us
[1:54:50] it takes an atmosphere
[1:54:52] for heaven to come among us
[1:54:55] heaven is sensitive the heavenly realm
[1:54:57] the spirit realm is sensitive like the
[1:55:00] dove
[1:55:01] and the least little bit of disturbance
[1:55:03] will keep that that presence above us
[1:55:08] instead of with us
[1:55:09] brother branham talked about that gentle
[1:55:11] dove of the holy spirit so easily
[1:55:13] offended so easily uh disturbed
[1:55:17] and he said he would just take his
[1:55:18] flight like a little bird out the window
[1:55:20] and perch on a tree over there i won't i
[1:55:22] do not believe that the holy ghost
[1:55:23] leaves the believer
[1:55:25] i don't believe that's what he's talking
[1:55:26] about i believe he's talking and
[1:55:28] teaching us about atmosphere
[1:55:30] one little wrong spirit brought into the
[1:55:33] house of god
[1:55:34] one little wrong attitude and brother we
[1:55:36] we never have a service without them
[1:55:38] because we're human beings
[1:55:40] and because some people do not see their
[1:55:43] need to correct their spirit
[1:55:47] and so there's always that disturbance
[1:55:49] and so it becomes such an effort
[1:55:51] sometime to bring heaven in
[1:55:54] and that's why worship becomes so
[1:55:56] important and that's why the enemy is
[1:55:58] against worship preach brother
[1:56:01] that's why the devil hates worship
[1:56:02] that's why the devil targets worship
[1:56:04] leaders
[1:56:08] because he knows there's a power in that
[1:56:11] place
[1:56:12] to bring heaven into the atmosphere of
[1:56:15] earth
[1:56:16] and when heaven comes down in the very
[1:56:18] presence of the heavenly comes and
[1:56:20] manifests itself in our house you heard
[1:56:23] the prophet say you heard jesus say all
[1:56:26] things
[1:56:28] are possible
[1:56:30] in that atmosphere
[1:56:32] death can't live in that atmosphere
[1:56:34] that's the atmosphere of resurrection
[1:56:36] and so that's why all of the enemy's
[1:56:38] guns are trained on worship and why the
[1:56:41] enemy wants to intimidate you to worship
[1:56:45] and that's why some of you look around
[1:56:47] one of these days you're going to hate
[1:56:49] me because i i wonder sometime how long
[1:56:52] it'll be before i just say hey quit
[1:56:54] looking at him
[1:56:59] quit look at it higher
[1:57:02] look to the lord
[1:57:05] don't you look to see how they're
[1:57:08] worshiping all right gotta do is go back
[1:57:10] watch the app
[1:57:14] you can see how people act
[1:57:17] just go back and watch a video of the
[1:57:18] service
[1:57:20] but while you're in here
[1:57:22] don't look down the end of your row to
[1:57:24] see how your family is worshiping
[1:57:27] you'll miss your touch
[1:57:29] you'll miss your opportunity
[1:57:31] to communicate with the spirit realm
[1:57:34] anything and everything can take you out
[1:57:37] that's why it's so important and the
[1:57:39] musicians that's why it's beautiful when
[1:57:41] they're willing to come a little early
[1:57:43] it doesn't always
[1:57:46] work out all the sour notes
[1:57:49] there may still be the opportunity that
[1:57:51] they're not flowing together but they're
[1:57:53] trying when they come together like that
[1:57:55] and they put their hearts together
[1:57:57] they're trying with everything they can
[1:57:59] to stay together as much as possible
[1:58:03] because they understand it if they don't
[1:58:05] they need to understand i believe
[1:58:07] they've heard and they understand
[1:58:09] that the least little bit
[1:58:11] that's why we singers
[1:58:13] when we're singing a song brother greely
[1:58:15] or myself or any of the rest of you
[1:58:16] leading a service ben
[1:58:18] or benjamin whoever how it's we hate it
[1:58:21] so much
[1:58:22] i do and i know they do when we start
[1:58:25] off in a wrong key
[1:58:27] it doesn't always affect things
[1:58:29] but we know there's the potential that
[1:58:32] something is innocent and small as that
[1:58:35] can disturb the atmosphere in such a way
[1:58:38] that it just takes so much effort and
[1:58:40] labor to get people's minds back on what
[1:58:44] we're singing and what we're doing
[1:58:46] that's why some people be better off to
[1:58:47] wear blindfold in worship
[1:58:51] no wonder people are tempted to close
[1:58:53] their eyes when they worship sometimes
[1:58:55] because it's so much easier to block out
[1:58:57] everything around you what are you doing
[1:58:59] brother sister you're building an
[1:59:01] atmosphere because you've got a need
[1:59:04] who came here this morning somebody's
[1:59:05] going to help me preach before we're
[1:59:06] done who came here today with a need in
[1:59:09] your life all of us
[1:59:12] all of us came with a need
[1:59:14] and the answer to that is here
[1:59:18] the help that you need is here because
[1:59:21] we've come together in his name
[1:59:23] but we let this and that and the other
[1:59:26] why
[1:59:28] i've seen eight or ten people sometimes
[1:59:30] maybe 12 people looking somewhere else
[1:59:33] in the room
[1:59:34] to see how somebody else is taking
[1:59:37] the atmosphere or how they're reacting
[1:59:39] to the atmosphere or how they're
[1:59:40] worshiping why do you care
[1:59:44] why do you care it's the enemy trying to
[1:59:46] distract you
[1:59:48] from getting what you need
[1:59:50] i'll tell you what i do i encourage you
[1:59:52] if you're uncomfortable where you are
[1:59:55] let's really get a stink stirred up
[1:59:58] change seats so everybody where you were
[2:00:00] sitting can thank you move because of
[2:00:02] them
[2:00:04] whoa we'll have a real revival here
[2:00:07] cause everybody be mad at each other
[2:00:10] i know why she moved she moved because
[2:00:13] she thought i was a hindrance why don't
[2:00:15] you get above all that
[2:00:17] don't you be stuck nowhere don't you be
[2:00:20] stuck anywhere in this house where you
[2:00:22] can't worship the lord and don't blame
[2:00:24] nobody for you don't blame nobody else
[2:00:28] it may be you you just can't keep your
[2:00:30] eyes off of something else so you find
[2:00:32] you a place where you don't have to look
[2:00:34] at nobody oh my i wonder where that'd be
[2:00:41] closer you get the less you have to deal
[2:00:43] with
[2:00:51] if it was up to me i'd close off the
[2:00:53] last three or four rows of the church
[2:00:55] i'd shut them down
[2:00:57] and force people to get closer
[2:01:00] there's something about being together
[2:01:02] and getting up there and eliminating
[2:01:04] some of the hindrances that people allow
[2:01:06] things they allow it's on us it's on us
[2:01:09] don't blame other people it's on us
[2:01:12] but we if you could just shut some of
[2:01:14] that out and get in a place where
[2:01:16] nothing bothered you like that if a sour
[2:01:19] note was hit or a song you don't like
[2:01:21] was sung you just wouldn't even that
[2:01:23] wouldn't even be a speed bump in the
[2:01:24] road
[2:01:26] you just keep right on entering in
[2:01:29] to his presence
[2:01:31] until your spirit could reach out and
[2:01:33] have direct communication with the one
[2:01:35] who created you my i believe this is
[2:01:38] part of what god wants us to do
[2:01:40] now in that verse 7 that word breath
[2:01:43] there and god for man out of the dust of
[2:01:46] the ground and breathed into his
[2:01:47] nostrils the breath that word breath
[2:01:50] means movement of air
[2:01:53] and it also means the breathing of god
[2:01:56] this was god breathing
[2:01:59] on adam in adam
[2:02:01] that word soul became a living soul
[2:02:03] that's the nephesh and it means a living
[2:02:06] being
[2:02:07] and then the phrase
[2:02:09] breathe the breath of life if you look
[2:02:12] at that in the literal it really means
[2:02:15] blow a blast of breath so god blew
[2:02:20] a blast of breath into a dead
[2:02:24] lifeless body that had been yet made in
[2:02:28] the image of the creator yet it lay
[2:02:31] there dead
[2:02:33] we might say it like brother branham all
[2:02:36] the mechanics were there
[2:02:38] lungs were there
[2:02:40] heart was there
[2:02:42] all the systems of the body there but no
[2:02:45] dynamics
[2:02:47] it took the breath of god breathing life
[2:02:51] it took the dynamics
[2:02:53] joining with the mechanics to make adam
[2:02:56] a living soul a living being who could
[2:02:58] be completely in tune with his creator
[2:03:02] while being completely in tune with his
[2:03:04] environment not one disturbing the other
[2:03:07] communication or connection but all
[2:03:10] functioning properly now you know this
[2:03:12] would be a good place to just insert
[2:03:14] this little teaching that we came into
[2:03:16] some years ago where you have to
[2:03:18] determine what part of you you're
[2:03:20] feeding
[2:03:21] and most of us do pretty good at feeding
[2:03:23] the flesh
[2:03:25] sometimes we're feeding the soul because
[2:03:28] we're we're yielding to the mind and to
[2:03:31] the will and to the emotion and we love
[2:03:33] to get in the middle of a stink
[2:03:38] some people thrive on conflict
[2:03:41] help me preach
[2:03:43] some people really come alive
[2:03:46] when there's turmoil
[2:03:49] and well you know what that does that
[2:03:50] feeds the soul
[2:03:52] the mind the will the more they just get
[2:03:54] bigger and bigger and bigger but you
[2:03:55] know we're not supposed to be working on
[2:03:57] that we're supposed to be working on
[2:03:58] feeding the spirit and there's nothing
[2:04:01] that feeds the spirit but the word of
[2:04:03] god the word of god is what feeds the
[2:04:06] spirit and we have to listen you can't
[2:04:08] survive on sunday morning and tuesday
[2:04:11] night i'm telling you now we're in the
[2:04:13] last of the last days you'll not survive
[2:04:17] if you only eat your for your spirit man
[2:04:20] two little measly times a week
[2:04:25] you gotta feed the spirit man
[2:04:28] you've got to hear the spiritual food
[2:04:31] that has been stored up for us
[2:04:35] god's grace
[2:04:36] to us
[2:04:38] now there's a lot of question now about
[2:04:40] whether or not we need the fivefold
[2:04:42] ministry we do if we want to get on the
[2:04:44] other side of until
[2:04:47] as long as we're satisfied to live on
[2:04:49] this side of until that's okay but if we
[2:04:52] ever want to get on the other side of
[2:04:54] until we've got to see the proper
[2:04:56] functioning of the apostle prophet
[2:04:58] pastor teacher and evangelist in the
[2:05:00] earth they may not all sit in the local
[2:05:02] body that would be perfection and we
[2:05:05] would very much love to see that but in
[2:05:07] the body of christ those offices must be
[2:05:10] represented they have a job to do
[2:05:13] and that's the only thing the bible said
[2:05:15] the scripture said could get us on the
[2:05:18] other side
[2:05:19] of until
[2:05:20] is the proper operation of the fivefold
[2:05:23] ministry now
[2:05:25] that does not mean that that's all we
[2:05:28] need we need the word that god has sent
[2:05:30] to prepare a bride and that's why we
[2:05:33] feed on the message that god has given
[2:05:35] us the message of the hour because we
[2:05:37] know that god uses that in very
[2:05:41] supernatural ways to talk to us 60 70
[2:05:44] years later
[2:05:47] why is it so perfect like that because
[2:05:49] god stored it that way
[2:05:52] so that you may be going through
[2:05:54] something 75 years after a sermon was
[2:05:57] preached but you put it in and it
[2:05:59] describes exactly where you're standing
[2:06:03] in that hour that is not coincidence
[2:06:07] that is not happenstance is anybody
[2:06:10] helping me that's god's ordained way
[2:06:14] to keep us on the right track
[2:06:17] amen
[2:06:19] it sure is now we got to move along
[2:06:21] just one o'clock though i haven't been
[2:06:23] preaching very long
[2:06:25] not yet but i
[2:06:27] i'll hurry maybe
[2:06:30] now ephesians 1 10 talks about again
[2:06:34] this coming together of earth in heaven
[2:06:37] that in the dispensation
[2:06:39] of the fullness
[2:06:41] of times
[2:06:43] he might gather together in one
[2:06:46] all things in christ both which are in
[2:06:50] heaven
[2:06:51] and which are on earth
[2:06:54] even in him
[2:06:56] in jesus is the place in jesus
[2:07:00] is the position
[2:07:02] in jesus is where heaven and earth meet
[2:07:06] it's in jesus somebody say in jesus
[2:07:09] it's in him it's in messiah if you use
[2:07:11] this yeshua it's in yeshua it's being
[2:07:14] found in
[2:07:16] him
[2:07:18] and remember there's a portion of your
[2:07:20] soul that will keep you out of him
[2:07:22] so that's why the mind has to be
[2:07:24] constantly sanctified and disciplined by
[2:07:27] the spirit
[2:07:28] but if you're feeding the soul the soul
[2:07:31] becomes like the sumo wrestler
[2:07:35] if you're not feeding the spirit the
[2:07:37] spirit becomes like a stick man
[2:07:40] and how many of you know a stick man
[2:07:43] it's not likely to overcome a sumo
[2:07:46] wrestler
[2:07:48] so what we have to do is starve
[2:07:53] the soul
[2:07:55] stay out of the mind
[2:07:58] win that battle with the word
[2:08:01] you can't you can't
[2:08:02] you know
[2:08:03] divorce yourself from the mind it's a
[2:08:06] it's a gift of god
[2:08:07] you've got to exchange your mind for
[2:08:11] for his mind his mind is not the mind
[2:08:13] from the realm of soul his mind is the
[2:08:15] mind of the spirit
[2:08:17] so when you replace your natural mind
[2:08:20] with the mind of christ you're really
[2:08:22] moving back to who you were created to
[2:08:25] be in the beginning
[2:08:26] that's exactly right
[2:08:28] and so you want to feed the spirit man
[2:08:31] and the word and the atmosphere of glory
[2:08:34] is what feeds the spirit man
[2:08:36] i don't have to tell you what feeds the
[2:08:38] soul man everything that's not of god
[2:08:41] will feed the mind and the will and the
[2:08:42] emotions
[2:08:44] i have told you before your soul is not
[2:08:46] your enemy your mind is not your enemy
[2:08:48] your will is not your enemy your
[2:08:49] emotions are not your enemy but if
[2:08:52] they're not sanctified and led by the
[2:08:53] spirit
[2:08:55] if you follow the leadership of that
[2:08:57] instead of the leadership of the spirit
[2:08:59] it'll get you into conflict
[2:09:02] it'll cause world war iv
[2:09:04] to break out right inside of here
[2:09:07] and you don't have to struggle that way
[2:09:08] because god's made a way for the things
[2:09:10] that are in heaven and the things that
[2:09:12] are in earth to come together in christ
[2:09:16] and for you to sit right there in christ
[2:09:18] and have the peace that you need to
[2:09:20] continue are you with me
[2:09:22] so then in ecclesiastes 12 7 look there
[2:09:25] i want to make sure you have the word
[2:09:27] ecclesiastes 12 7.
[2:09:30] this is when we come to the end of life
[2:09:35] then shall the dust
[2:09:37] return to the earth as it was
[2:09:40] and the spirit
[2:09:44] shall return
[2:09:46] unto god
[2:09:48] who gave it
[2:09:55] it doesn't mention
[2:09:58] the part of the of you
[2:10:01] that's made up of mind will and emotions
[2:10:07] the bible says the soul that sinneth
[2:10:14] shall surely die
[2:10:17] i know there's a lot of people that
[2:10:18] don't understand
[2:10:21] that the scripture means what it says
[2:10:23] and says what it means
[2:10:26] there's a part of you that lives forever
[2:10:29] but there is a part of you that you
[2:10:31] won't always need
[2:10:34] when we lay that body down there at the
[2:10:36] graveyard that body that contains soul
[2:10:39] and spirit
[2:10:41] that body is going to go back to the
[2:10:42] dust where it came from but the spirit
[2:10:45] doesn't lay there in the grave
[2:10:47] so when you go out there and chat
[2:10:52] you're just talking to dirt
[2:10:55] you're just talking to ashes you're not
[2:10:57] talking to the spirit the real man the
[2:10:58] real woman that you laid there you're i
[2:11:00] mean it's all right if that helps you in
[2:11:02] some way
[2:11:04] as long as you don't do it at halloween
[2:11:06] time
[2:11:09] but i know sometimes we go out and we
[2:11:11] say oh i wish you could see the mess
[2:11:13] your youngins have made
[2:11:14] [Laughter]
[2:11:16] i know people do that but i want you to
[2:11:18] know there's nothing there to hear you
[2:11:21] i hope you don't think that the spirit
[2:11:23] of a man lingers in the cemetery
[2:11:26] i don't believe in spooks do you
[2:11:29] the spirit goes back
[2:11:32] it returns to god who gave it
[2:11:36] it moves into another dimension
[2:11:40] one of these days it's going to swing
[2:11:42] down
[2:11:45] pick up a new body
[2:11:48] right
[2:11:49] it's a new body
[2:11:51] that's coming out of that grave
[2:11:54] not the old one
[2:11:55] but a new one
[2:11:57] so in the end our body goes back to dirt
[2:11:59] our spirit goes back to god to give it
[2:12:01] now dust in scripture for those of you
[2:12:05] who are still bearing
[2:12:07] able to stay with me
[2:12:09] dust in scripture is typical of the
[2:12:12] carnal nature of man
[2:12:14] or the flesh nature adam's flesh was
[2:12:17] made from the dust the curse upon the
[2:12:20] serpent was what
[2:12:22] that he would crawl
[2:12:24] on his belly
[2:12:27] the all the days of his life
[2:12:30] and eat dust
[2:12:33] so when we see dust representing the
[2:12:36] fallen nature of man or the flesh nature
[2:12:39] of man and we hear the beast
[2:12:43] the serpent beast that yielded itself to
[2:12:46] satan the serpent wasn't satan
[2:12:49] the serpent was a beast that was was
[2:12:52] utilized
[2:12:54] occupied by satan
[2:12:57] but the beast had to bear a curse
[2:13:01] at one time by this language we are safe
[2:13:04] to say at one time what we would call a
[2:13:08] serpent walked upright
[2:13:11] or else it wouldn't be a curse to make
[2:13:13] it lay down on the ground and eat the
[2:13:15] dust
[2:13:16] so we don't know exactly what it looked
[2:13:18] like brother branham described it as
[2:13:20] looking very much like a man
[2:13:23] but having no soul
[2:13:26] i wasn't there but i think that's as
[2:13:28] good of a description as anybody could
[2:13:29] ever think of
[2:13:31] but i know that when it when it yielded
[2:13:33] itself to satan
[2:13:35] and spoke on behalf of satan and
[2:13:38] communicated for satan the enemy the
[2:13:41] fallen angel then we know that it was
[2:13:44] cursed
[2:13:46] and it was made to
[2:13:48] crawl a slither
[2:13:50] on its belly and eat dust and that
[2:13:53] signifies that that satan was to feed on
[2:13:56] the carnal nature of man
[2:13:59] now i want to tell you something satan
[2:14:01] is feasting
[2:14:03] on the carnal nature of man
[2:14:07] you let there be a carnal nature present
[2:14:09] and satan will utilize every advantage
[2:14:13] he will take every opportunity he can to
[2:14:16] stir in that carnal nature if you've got
[2:14:19] a carnal part of you that's still alive
[2:14:21] satan will stir in that
[2:14:24] he will open doors for you did you know
[2:14:27] that satan can open door he will open
[2:14:29] doors and opportunities for you
[2:14:33] to to yield yourself to that kind of a
[2:14:36] nature
[2:14:38] things that you're not even looking for
[2:14:40] will come looking for you
[2:14:42] if you're walking in that fallen nature
[2:14:44] or living out of that carnal nature
[2:14:47] now satan's dominion over man is
[2:14:50] perpetuated by man's carnal nature and
[2:14:52] through the ages one of satan's most
[2:14:55] successful tactics for robbing god's
[2:14:58] people of their inheritance has been for
[2:15:01] him to offer immediate gratification for
[2:15:04] their flesh
[2:15:08] in the same way that the holy spirit
[2:15:10] might anoint you in spirit
[2:15:13] the enemy will anoint your flesh
[2:15:17] he will utilize the fallen nature of
[2:15:20] your flesh and offer you instant
[2:15:24] gratification
[2:15:30] don't sit there like you don't know what
[2:15:31] i said
[2:15:33] you know exactly what i said
[2:15:36] he will put an opportunity before you
[2:15:40] that you will find a struggle to resist
[2:15:45] you can't say you don't know where it
[2:15:47] came from
[2:15:48] it came from the enemy
[2:15:50] but how did it touch you it touched you
[2:15:53] because of an unresolved issue
[2:15:57] in your carnality
[2:16:02] you see there are churches that teach
[2:16:04] that lust is something that we can
[2:16:06] control and just and just keep it under
[2:16:09] under wrap but i want you to know that's
[2:16:12] not what the scripture teaches us about
[2:16:14] lust
[2:16:16] it's not just something that you push
[2:16:18] down it's something that you've got to
[2:16:19] crucify
[2:16:21] it's something that you've got to nail
[2:16:22] on the cross
[2:16:24] it's something that you've got to fight
[2:16:26] against with everything the spirit gives
[2:16:28] you to fight with
[2:16:31] until you win the victory over that
[2:16:35] as long as you allow lust to be an
[2:16:37] unresolved issue in your life satan will
[2:16:40] use that issue he will use that door he
[2:16:43] will use that window and he will put
[2:16:45] things in front of you
[2:16:48] you'll be checking the weather
[2:16:51] and the enemy will place something right
[2:16:52] there in front of you
[2:16:55] people make fun of brother branham a
[2:16:56] little bit when he talks about things
[2:16:58] like that but if jesus was tempted in
[2:17:00] every manner of sin as we are yet
[2:17:03] without sin we shouldn't find it so
[2:17:06] difficult to understand that brother
[2:17:07] branham was also a man somebody somebody
[2:17:11] might say a warm-blooded man
[2:17:14] he had a lovely wife
[2:17:17] but brother branham said any more
[2:17:19] you walk down you drive down the street
[2:17:22] and you see these women standing out
[2:17:23] there
[2:17:24] he said you can hardly tell
[2:17:27] if they're on the inside fighting to get
[2:17:29] out or the outside fighting to get in
[2:17:32] more cotton in an aspirin bottle
[2:17:37] he said if if
[2:17:39] if eating apples is what caused adam and
[2:17:41] eve
[2:17:42] to discover that they were naked
[2:17:44] somebody better pass the apples
[2:17:49] because somebody's not been eating any
[2:17:51] apples
[2:17:52] because people go you let me tell you
[2:17:54] something you don't have to go to the
[2:17:56] beach to meet that
[2:17:57] not anymore
[2:18:00] you can go to walmart
[2:18:03] you can see somebody's rear end hanging
[2:18:05] out of their shorts
[2:18:09] at walmart
[2:18:10] now what you're going to do if you leave
[2:18:11] that unresolved issue
[2:18:14] and you don't deal with that thing i
[2:18:15] mean actively fight that thing and let
[2:18:17] the blood of jesus christ be applied to
[2:18:19] that and let the word of god address
[2:18:21] that and keep coming back to him and and
[2:18:24] swallowing your pride sometime and
[2:18:26] walking up here and standing in the in
[2:18:28] an altar or kneeling in an altar and
[2:18:30] confessing that that thing is trying to
[2:18:32] destroy your life somebody said if i
[2:18:34] confess that it'll destroy your marriage
[2:18:36] i'm here to tell you if you don't
[2:18:38] confess that your marriage might be
[2:18:41] destroyed anyway
[2:18:47] brother branham believed in being honest
[2:18:49] with our companions and with our spouses
[2:18:52] and he believed in making that right
[2:18:55] and most of you know that there was a
[2:18:57] couple that worshiped god here all those
[2:19:00] years
[2:19:02] until they both died still in the faith
[2:19:04] still in this church and when that man
[2:19:07] heard the message
[2:19:09] and accepted the message
[2:19:12] he had been a soldier
[2:19:13] and had served in the military and he
[2:19:16] had more than one woman on the
[2:19:18] side and when he came to the lord he sat
[2:19:22] down and told his wife
[2:19:25] who quite honestly struggled to forgive
[2:19:28] him
[2:19:29] because she was a human
[2:19:32] just like he was
[2:19:36] but he could not allow that thing to
[2:19:39] fester
[2:19:40] in him
[2:19:42] and he heard the prophet say you go make
[2:19:44] that thing right
[2:19:45] now i don't know how you feel about this
[2:19:48] but i admire it
[2:19:50] he sat his wife down and told her his
[2:19:52] sins
[2:19:53] she knew that he had been serving sin
[2:19:56] he told her his sins and that he had
[2:19:58] come
[2:19:59] she knew that he had changed she knew
[2:20:01] that he had come to the lord
[2:20:03] and he said there's a few women i want
[2:20:05] you to go with me to visit
[2:20:10] she'd already come to the lord what
[2:20:13] there's a few women that i want you to
[2:20:15] go with me in some required out-of-town
[2:20:17] trip
[2:20:18] and she said whatever for he said i've
[2:20:20] been unfaithful
[2:20:23] oh it's quiet
[2:20:26] aren't you glad nobody in here needs
[2:20:28] this kind of preaching
[2:20:30] aren't you glad we can keep it in the
[2:20:31] past because nobody here will need this
[2:20:35] if i were to believe that i would have
[2:20:37] no explanation for the dead silence
[2:20:41] somebody needs to hear
[2:20:45] how would you have liked to have been
[2:20:46] there not me i'm i'm a nosy person but i
[2:20:48] would not want to be in the room when
[2:20:50] you walk when you knock on a door and
[2:20:52] ring a doorbell and you're standing
[2:20:54] there and the woman that you've had an
[2:20:55] affair against your wife is standing
[2:20:57] there opening the door and there you
[2:20:59] stand with your wife with a smile on
[2:21:00] your face my nice to see you it's been
[2:21:03] 15 years or however long it's been and
[2:21:05] you go and sit down in the living room
[2:21:07] and you say to that woman i have come
[2:21:10] i've repented to god i have repented to
[2:21:12] my wife and now i'm here to repent to
[2:21:15] you i want you to forgive me i knew what
[2:21:19] i was doing was wrong
[2:21:25] what would you call that i'd call that a
[2:21:27] real repentance
[2:21:31] i'd call it somebody shutting doors
[2:21:35] slamming windows
[2:21:37] doing everything within his own power
[2:21:40] to try to put that thing to rest
[2:21:43] come on now that doesn't mean it was
[2:21:44] never a problem or never rose up or the
[2:21:46] enemy never tried or that he never had
[2:21:48] another thought but what it means is he
[2:21:51] was doing everything actively that he
[2:21:52] possibly could
[2:21:54] to make sure that satan couldn't be
[2:21:56] stirring his finger
[2:22:00] talk about getting out of your past
[2:22:02] it would do some folk
[2:22:06] good oh my
[2:22:11] satan's dominion
[2:22:12] over man is perpetuated by man's carnal
[2:22:14] nature through the ages one of satan's
[2:22:16] most successful tactics for robbing
[2:22:18] god's people of their inheritance has
[2:22:20] been to offer them the immediate
[2:22:22] gratification of their flesh
[2:22:24] and this is why putting pornography in
[2:22:25] people's hands
[2:22:27] by the way of a smartphone is such a
[2:22:30] dangerous and slippery slope
[2:22:35] and one more time let me encourage you
[2:22:37] as parents
[2:22:39] who have children in your home
[2:22:43] regardless of their age
[2:22:46] if they live in your home you have a
[2:22:48] right and not only a right you have a
[2:22:52] responsibility
[2:22:56] to monitor what they do
[2:22:59] on social media
[2:23:03] i wished i had some help
[2:23:05] come on
[2:23:07] because there are so many now
[2:23:09] it's not just facebook it's instagram
[2:23:11] it's tick-tock
[2:23:13] tick-tock
[2:23:16] what whatsapp
[2:23:19] they're those those apps i don't
[2:23:22] remember but you could tell me
[2:23:24] what they are but some of them are set
[2:23:26] up in such a way that after a little
[2:23:28] while snapchat was one of them they got
[2:23:30] some folks in trouble around here
[2:23:34] you can put a picture or video or or a
[2:23:37] statement i guess and and after a
[2:23:39] certain time it disappears
[2:23:43] why would somebody get involved in
[2:23:45] something like that except for the fact
[2:23:47] they only wanted certain people to see
[2:23:48] it
[2:23:49] that's
[2:23:50] dangerous business
[2:23:54] there's young people associated with
[2:23:57] this church that are dibbling in things
[2:24:00] they should be very
[2:24:02] very careful about and parents please
[2:24:07] please do your best
[2:24:09] i know it's hard but please do your best
[2:24:14] to monitor these things if you're going
[2:24:16] to allow it you have a responsibility to
[2:24:19] do your best to monitor it
[2:24:23] someone recently showed me a a a social
[2:24:27] post from someone a young person
[2:24:29] associated this church
[2:24:31] questioning their sexuality
[2:24:34] this is serious business and parents may
[2:24:37] not even know that it's going on
[2:24:41] we've got to know
[2:24:44] that old serpent he's still licking the
[2:24:47] dust
[2:24:49] satan is still stirring in those areas
[2:24:53] where the carnal nature is not dealt
[2:24:55] with
[2:24:57] he's looking for doors and windows and
[2:24:59] opportunities
[2:25:02] i see men in this church from time to
[2:25:05] time looking at women in a way you
[2:25:08] should not be looking at a woman
[2:25:16] you need to do something about that
[2:25:22] for multiple reasons
[2:25:27] a spiritual man
[2:25:31] serious serious business
[2:25:35] don't push me
[2:25:38] i'm telling you this morning don't push
[2:25:40] me
[2:25:42] i've watched it
[2:25:45] i've watched young men in this church
[2:25:47] watch women walking up the aisle
[2:25:52] do you ever say anything i have more
[2:25:54] than once
[2:25:57] but i'm not the holy ghost
[2:26:01] you're responsible for your wandering
[2:26:03] eye
[2:26:06] why brother branham said the way they
[2:26:08] stand on the corner the way they're out
[2:26:09] like that now dress the way they dress
[2:26:12] they look like a skinned down wiener
[2:26:17] for those of you that don't know that's
[2:26:19] what we used to call a hot dog
[2:26:23] and what i grew up calling is even worse
[2:26:25] than that
[2:26:27] i grew up calling it a weenie
[2:26:31] and people say that's just a terrible
[2:26:34] thing to say but that's that's what a
[2:26:36] hot dog was to me and brother branham
[2:26:38] was talking about those you know how the
[2:26:41] casing of
[2:26:42] of a hot dog would be he said they stand
[2:26:44] there looking like a like a skin down
[2:26:46] weiner
[2:26:50] he said so i just put this cross
[2:26:54] i'll hang it on my rear view mirror
[2:26:56] anybody listening
[2:26:59] i hang it on my rear view mirror in such
[2:27:02] a way that if i should glance and see a
[2:27:05] woman like that dressed on the street i
[2:27:07] immediately
[2:27:12] that causes you to lose confidence in
[2:27:13] him you're just kind of off balance
[2:27:16] there aren't you
[2:27:17] he said i just immediately turn my eyes
[2:27:22] to the cross
[2:27:23] and i remember what jesus has done for
[2:27:26] me
[2:27:27] brother sister let me tell you it's not
[2:27:29] worth it to yield yourself to a moment
[2:27:32] of gratification of this flesh and lose
[2:27:35] what you've tried to gain the ground
[2:27:38] that you've gained in serving the lord
[2:27:41] it's not worth it to throw it all away
[2:27:44] for just a moment like that we can have
[2:27:46] the victory i wish somebody would agree
[2:27:48] that we can have the victory over all of
[2:27:50] those things
[2:27:58] man is a spirit will you put that up do
[2:28:00] you see that that slide
[2:28:03] man is a spirit
[2:28:07] who has a soul
[2:28:10] and lives in a body
[2:28:13] that's it
[2:28:15] man is a spirit who has a soul mind will
[2:28:18] and emotions
[2:28:19] and lives in a body physical flesh
[2:28:22] that's who you are
[2:28:24] and that's why we read a moment ago
[2:28:26] first thessalonians 5 23 and the very
[2:28:28] god of peace sanctify you holy and i
[2:28:30] pray god your whole spirit and soul and
[2:28:32] body be preserved blameless unto the
[2:28:34] coming of the lord jesus christ
[2:28:37] now sometimes it appears that what's
[2:28:39] going on in the spirit and what's going
[2:28:40] on in the soul can be so close together
[2:28:43] that it's hard to know is this of god
[2:28:47] or is this of me
[2:28:49] but how many of you are glad the word
[2:28:52] has given us an answer
[2:28:54] show show the people hebrews 4 12
[2:28:57] and i'm nearly finished
[2:29:00] it's pretty quiet
[2:29:02] it's okay
[2:29:04] no quite it's okay
[2:29:06] it's all right
[2:29:08] for the word of god is quick
[2:29:11] and powerful
[2:29:14] and sharper than any two-edged sword
[2:29:18] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[2:29:22] soul
[2:29:23] and spirit
[2:29:26] is this me
[2:29:27] is this god
[2:29:30] is this my desire
[2:29:32] is this god's desire for me
[2:29:35] is this my thought
[2:29:37] is this god's thought
[2:29:42] is this my own leadership or is this the
[2:29:45] spirit of god leading me
[2:29:48] what is the remedy what is the answer
[2:29:49] what is the help how do we get to that
[2:29:52] place if there's a blurring
[2:29:54] if there's a time or a situation in our
[2:29:56] life where we're just not sure
[2:29:59] if this is god's leadership or if this
[2:30:01] is my own will my own desire my own
[2:30:04] maybe even in prayer we get messed up
[2:30:06] sometime because we're praying our will
[2:30:09] and when you're praying your will for
[2:30:11] somebody else that's an illegal form of
[2:30:14] witchcraft
[2:30:15] that's not
[2:30:16] intercession when you're trying to
[2:30:18] manipulate somebody with your prayer and
[2:30:21] brother i get stuck in not knowing how
[2:30:23] to pray just like you do that's why i go
[2:30:25] back to the lord and go back to his
[2:30:27] example in prayer
[2:30:30] and pray what he prayed
[2:30:32] because sometimes we don't know but if
[2:30:34] we get to that place where we're not
[2:30:35] exactly sure guess what the answer is
[2:30:38] the word of god
[2:30:40] the word of god is quick and powerful
[2:30:43] and sharper than a two-edged sword
[2:30:46] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[2:30:48] soul and spirit and of the joints and
[2:30:50] marrow that's part of the body the flesh
[2:30:53] and is a discerner the word of god the
[2:30:55] word of god the word of god is a
[2:30:57] discerner of the thoughts
[2:31:01] and the intents
[2:31:03] the intentions
[2:31:05] of the heart
[2:31:07] how many of you are thankful for the
[2:31:08] word
[2:31:09] i'm thankful for the word some of you
[2:31:11] aren't thankful some of you can't raise
[2:31:13] your hand i'm thankful i'm thankful for
[2:31:15] the word of god
[2:31:17] proverbs 20 27 in closing
[2:31:20] the spirit of man
[2:31:23] is the candle of the lord
[2:31:27] the spirit of man is the candle the
[2:31:30] light of the lord this is the this is
[2:31:33] the spirit that's been joined to the
[2:31:35] lord this is the regenerated
[2:31:39] the human spirit that has been
[2:31:41] regenerated by the divine
[2:31:45] this is what the holy ghost does in us i
[2:31:48] thought you were preaching on
[2:31:49] supplication and prayer i am but
[2:31:51] sometimes we've got to get some things
[2:31:53] in order and understanding before we can
[2:31:55] discover how we're really praying and
[2:31:58] what gift is being offered to us in
[2:32:00] prayer
[2:32:01] you can get right above your flesh you
[2:32:04] can get right above your soul
[2:32:06] and you can let your prayers come from
[2:32:08] the inner part of who you are the spirit
[2:32:11] of man is the candle of the lord
[2:32:13] searching all the inward parts of the
[2:32:16] belly
[2:32:18] and that word belly is a word that means
[2:32:21] the innermost being the inward part even
[2:32:25] the heart not the blood pump
[2:32:28] but the heart of man
[2:32:30] what's at the very root the inside of
[2:32:33] the inside of man which is spirit
[2:32:36] the spirit of man is the candle of the
[2:32:38] lord god uses that
[2:32:41] to search us
[2:32:43] to speak to our hearts
[2:32:46] to correct us to steer us to guide
[2:32:50] us i want to read a paragraph to you
[2:32:54] before we close
[2:32:56] actually i've got a few quotes i'm going
[2:32:57] to give you two 129.
[2:33:00] let me hurry
[2:33:02] how many of you have ever read anything
[2:33:03] by the author gene edwards
[2:33:06] gene edwards wrote a marvelous book
[2:33:09] called the divine romance
[2:33:11] you say oh that don't sound like a good
[2:33:13] it's a good one
[2:33:14] it helped me so much to understand
[2:33:17] god's love for me
[2:33:19] that's his bride
[2:33:21] he wrote a series of books one about
[2:33:23] creation one about the exodus one about
[2:33:25] the resurrection of jesus
[2:33:28] he wrote wrote some interesting things
[2:33:31] and this was a paragraph from his book
[2:33:35] of creation
[2:33:37] god came to man in the lowlands of the
[2:33:41] earth realm
[2:33:44] he breathed into the man
[2:33:47] so magnificently formed of the earth
[2:33:51] he breathed into him the spiritual realm
[2:33:57] the life-giving winds
[2:34:00] of heaven
[2:34:02] the breath of divinity i'm already
[2:34:05] hooked
[2:34:08] that's marvelous language
[2:34:10] so marvelous that i'm going to read it
[2:34:12] again for you that weren't listening the
[2:34:14] first time
[2:34:15] god came to man in the lowlands of the
[2:34:18] earth realm
[2:34:20] he breathed into the man so
[2:34:22] magnificently formed of the earth he
[2:34:24] breathed into him the spiritual realm
[2:34:27] the life-giving winds of heaven the
[2:34:30] breath of divinity
[2:34:32] out from the mouth of the almighty
[2:34:34] creator came a brilliant dazzling
[2:34:37] sparkling effervescence like living
[2:34:41] stars
[2:34:43] that surged with divine power into the
[2:34:46] nostrils of adam and flowed through
[2:34:50] his body and soul
[2:34:52] permeating every cell
[2:34:55] of his being
[2:34:58] the wind that spirit that breath that
[2:35:01] celestial air that divine and heavenly
[2:35:04] life animated
[2:35:07] the clay model
[2:35:09] creating within
[2:35:11] a dimensionless quality
[2:35:14] condition
[2:35:15] and state of being
[2:35:17] how many of you find that marvelous i
[2:35:19] don't care i'm not even going to ask you
[2:35:21] i find that marvelous
[2:35:24] it's something i can see
[2:35:26] i can see that divine life of god and
[2:35:29] his divine light flowing into the
[2:35:32] nostrils of a lifeless body of clay
[2:35:35] laying there and that man being
[2:35:37] permeated every cell of his body with
[2:35:39] the living life of the creator talk
[2:35:42] about being alive adam was never any
[2:35:44] more alive than he was in that very
[2:35:47] moment that the breath of god came
[2:35:49] rushing in hallelujah
[2:35:51] making him a living soul
[2:35:54] i have to read this for some that are
[2:35:56] battling
[2:35:57] in a message diseases and afflictions
[2:36:03] paragraph 42 and satan
[2:36:05] is against you
[2:36:08] anybody want to say amen
[2:36:11] that's a good thing
[2:36:13] that's a good thing
[2:36:16] therefore this cancer
[2:36:20] he starts or this tumor
[2:36:23] whatever it is
[2:36:25] from a germ
[2:36:26] [Music]
[2:36:27] he begins to multiply
[2:36:31] like a tumor becomes malignant
[2:36:34] so forth
[2:36:38] now brother branham
[2:36:40] is telling us
[2:36:42] something about how satan
[2:36:44] spreads himself
[2:36:46] and multiplies himself
[2:36:48] at vulnerable places in our life
[2:36:52] he is comparing it to the life of a
[2:36:54] tumor
[2:36:56] to the life of a cancer
[2:36:59] this is not what everybody believes but
[2:37:01] i believe it i believe this i believe
[2:37:04] that cancer has a life
[2:37:08] i believe that cancer is a spirit
[2:37:12] and it has a life
[2:37:13] and it has to be dealt with that way
[2:37:16] [Music]
[2:37:17] it's not just a disease
[2:37:19] it's not just a sickness but it's an
[2:37:22] entity
[2:37:23] it's a trespasser
[2:37:25] it has no right
[2:37:27] in the body of the believer
[2:37:29] somebody said well what if we pray and
[2:37:31] we pray and we pray and we pray and it
[2:37:32] can't be dealt with we keep praying we
[2:37:34] keep speaking against it we keep
[2:37:36] treating it like a trespasser and a
[2:37:38] squatter and an invader we don't ever
[2:37:41] call it ours we don't ever own it it's
[2:37:43] belonging to
[2:37:44] us and we ask that the resurrection life
[2:37:47] of jesus christ come and deal with it
[2:37:49] like he would any other death like he
[2:37:51] would any other spirit so i want you to
[2:37:53] see this brother branham
[2:37:55] he's talking about the work of satan and
[2:37:57] how he spreads himself and multiplies
[2:37:59] himself in our lives but he's using
[2:38:02] cancer or a tumor
[2:38:04] as an example he said it's a body
[2:38:07] just like you're of a body
[2:38:10] it has a spirit
[2:38:12] just like you are a spirit
[2:38:15] only
[2:38:16] it has not a
[2:38:19] soul
[2:38:23] it's not a human being
[2:38:25] it's not tripartite
[2:38:27] it has a body a cluster of cells
[2:38:30] it has a spirit that gives it life
[2:38:33] but it does not have a soul
[2:38:36] interesting isn't it
[2:38:38] it's actually how demons operate
[2:38:44] they are they are bodyless spirits
[2:38:48] that cannot be nearly as effective
[2:38:52] unless they occupy a
[2:38:54] body i'm not telling you they can't
[2:38:57] affect things they can shift a room
[2:39:00] they can shift the atmosphere of a room
[2:39:02] though they hang in no body
[2:39:04] no no physical form
[2:39:06] you can be aware of a presence knowing
[2:39:08] that it's a demonic spirit or an
[2:39:10] oppressive spirit and it's not in
[2:39:12] someone
[2:39:13] it just comes into the room as a
[2:39:15] disembodied spirit
[2:39:16] and we pray against that and we deal
[2:39:18] with that and i'm not talking about
[2:39:19] ghosts
[2:39:22] i'm talking about demon spirits that
[2:39:24] once upon a time had a body to live in
[2:39:26] and they no longer do
[2:39:30] but they have no soul
[2:39:33] they function more effectively when they
[2:39:35] find something to get in it doesn't have
[2:39:37] to be a human being it can be an animal
[2:39:40] somebody said you're getting a little
[2:39:41] weird
[2:39:44] and i don't have to tell you the
[2:39:46] the domestic species that brother
[2:39:48] branham seem to think those spirits like
[2:39:50] to get in more than others
[2:39:54] but i will tell you it wasn't a dog
[2:40:02] anything can carry a spirit
[2:40:05] your hamster can
[2:40:08] it's looking for a body to get in
[2:40:12] but brother branham talks it like this
[2:40:14] let's stay with a quote it has a spirit
[2:40:16] just like you our spirit only it has not
[2:40:19] a soul
[2:40:20] but it has a life
[2:40:24] like you have a life
[2:40:26] cancer has a life
[2:40:28] like you have a life
[2:40:29] interesting isn't it well it's it
[2:40:31] operates in the cells
[2:40:33] he said and therefore then in you in
[2:40:36] your flesh
[2:40:37] there's two lives this makes me mad
[2:40:42] when i read this this makes me mad
[2:40:46] [Music]
[2:40:47] maybe this is what's missing
[2:40:49] maybe we're not mad enough at the devil
[2:40:51] for what he's trying to do in our body
[2:40:55] this makes me mad he said therefore in
[2:40:58] your flesh there's two lives one one are
[2:41:00] you one is you and the other one is
[2:41:04] another being
[2:41:06] multiplying cells
[2:41:08] growing a body just like you growed in a
[2:41:11] body is that right now if you understand
[2:41:15] that at all it can change your approach
[2:41:19] to the enemy placing something in you
[2:41:21] and giving it a foreign life
[2:41:26] we've been told and i give you the
[2:41:28] instance a few minutes ago that's not
[2:41:29] supposed to be able to dwell in you
[2:41:32] we know that god has the power
[2:41:35] there are two ladies in here this
[2:41:37] morning that are facing something
[2:41:40] like that
[2:41:42] and we're not going to accept anything
[2:41:46] but total deliverance
[2:41:50] one knows that there's something
[2:41:52] cancerous present one knows there's
[2:41:54] something there not sure exactly what it
[2:41:57] is until the biopsy is done and we're
[2:41:59] saying today it doesn't matter
[2:42:03] whether it's cancer or non-cancer
[2:42:06] even if it's just a tumor even if it's
[2:42:08] just a collection of cells it may be
[2:42:11] that the enemy is trying
[2:42:14] to work on you
[2:42:17] because where does that stuff work on us
[2:42:20] do you know it's not the body
[2:42:24] it works on the body but that's not
[2:42:25] where the battle is
[2:42:28] you know good and well you can live
[2:42:29] without an arm you can live without a
[2:42:32] certain organs of your body you know
[2:42:34] that this this thing is a mind battle
[2:42:38] and when you hear the word
[2:42:42] the big
[2:42:43] you know
[2:42:44] the enemy loves his he loves to stick
[2:42:47] his foot
[2:42:49] in your door and say
[2:42:50] [Laughter]
[2:42:52] let me put something on you that you
[2:42:54] have no control of
[2:42:58] what a dummy
[2:43:02] what a dumb thing to say
[2:43:05] yes you do have power
[2:43:08] yes you do have authority on the
[2:43:11] trespassing enemy
[2:43:13] who lays a foreign life in your body a
[2:43:17] spirit
[2:43:19] that is not your spirit that has been
[2:43:22] transformed by the holy spirit but a
[2:43:25] life and the spirit that's there we know
[2:43:28] why it's there
[2:43:30] can i just tell you why it's there it's
[2:43:32] there to destroy you
[2:43:36] it might be three cells
[2:43:40] or it might be the tumor or size of a
[2:43:42] grapefruit
[2:43:43] it doesn't matter the size it's there to
[2:43:46] destroy you
[2:43:50] oh i feel excited
[2:43:52] you mean to tell me you're talking about
[2:43:54] something like that and you feel excited
[2:43:57] oh yes
[2:44:01] because i just heard in my spirit man
[2:44:04] brother branham describing that that
[2:44:07] tumor that was trying to take over
[2:44:09] sister mita's body he's down here in
[2:44:12] shreveport louisiana preaching for
[2:44:14] brother jack moore and sister branham
[2:44:17] goes to the last she goes to her last uh
[2:44:20] place her last examination by the doctor
[2:44:24] because that tumor was getting so large
[2:44:26] it was laying over her skin it was
[2:44:28] laying over and making a place that
[2:44:30] could be felt physically with a hand and
[2:44:33] the word of the lord fell on the prophet
[2:44:35] and god was dealing with him about the
[2:44:37] power of the spoken word and the word of
[2:44:39] the lord fell on the prophet and he
[2:44:40] prophesied before the doctor's hand
[2:44:42] touches that tumor it'll
[2:44:44] disappear that's what just
[2:44:50] that's what just dropped down in my
[2:44:52] spirit
[2:44:53] so any opportunity that god has to show
[2:44:56] himself god
[2:44:59] can excite us
[2:45:01] it doesn't have to destroy us
[2:45:03] emotionally
[2:45:04] it can thrill us to know that it's a
[2:45:07] great opportunity for jesus christ to
[2:45:10] make himself the same
[2:45:12] [Music]
[2:45:13] yesterday and today and forever are you
[2:45:17] still here
[2:45:20] hallelujah
[2:45:25] i want to read another one i'm closing
[2:45:30] this is from the message believing god
[2:45:37] paragraph 93 thank you
[2:45:39] and that soul is the same way
[2:45:42] until the soul died and then was born
[2:45:45] again of god
[2:45:46] then that soul
[2:45:49] can't die
[2:45:51] i don't believe in two souls
[2:45:55] i don't believe that god takes one soul
[2:45:58] and gives you another soul i have many
[2:46:00] friends who believe that i don't believe
[2:46:02] that that fits the continuity of
[2:46:05] scripture
[2:46:06] but i believe the nature of that soul
[2:46:08] dies in the new birth
[2:46:10] i believe the very inner being inner
[2:46:12] working the very nature of that soul
[2:46:15] dies and the resurrection life of jesus
[2:46:18] christ comes in his great ability to
[2:46:21] recreate
[2:46:23] and to regenerate that's what
[2:46:25] resurrection does it regenerates and
[2:46:28] recreates
[2:46:30] and so if your spirit is changed it has
[2:46:33] to bring a change
[2:46:35] to your soul life
[2:46:37] as well and that soul is the very same
[2:46:39] way until the soul died and then was
[2:46:41] born again of god then that soul can't
[2:46:43] die the soul that sinneth shall die
[2:46:47] that's what the scripture said and i'm
[2:46:49] there
[2:46:50] but he that believeth on me
[2:46:52] has everlasting life
[2:46:54] we're just all we're trying to say is
[2:46:57] that there's no everlasting life there
[2:46:59] is no eternal life
[2:47:01] in any other form or fashion than that
[2:47:03] which is given by the lord jesus christ
[2:47:06] satan cannot give you everlasting life
[2:47:09] hell can't give you everlasting life
[2:47:13] cannot
[2:47:14] alright he goes on the soul that sinneth
[2:47:16] shall die but he that believeth on me
[2:47:17] has everlasting life then there is an
[2:47:19] immortal life living in that body
[2:47:22] whoop
[2:47:23] he said now that's like a stream coming
[2:47:25] from heaven like a core on the inside of
[2:47:29] a man now that's the part that's godly
[2:47:32] that operates
[2:47:34] the body this body
[2:47:36] but before this body can ever become
[2:47:40] perfected the spirit will bring in it or
[2:47:45] it in the spirit will bring it in
[2:47:48] submission to god
[2:47:51] to make you
[2:47:52] see the spirit is working to bring the
[2:47:56] mind and the will and the emotion into
[2:47:58] submission to god which then calls the
[2:48:01] flesh
[2:48:03] into submission
[2:48:05] you work just like just like
[2:48:06] thessalonians says it works the same
[2:48:09] order here i just can't imagine
[2:48:11] what comments i'm getting from those who
[2:48:14] see it in a different order i hope you
[2:48:15] won't let that confuse you and miss the
[2:48:17] point of what god's trying to do
[2:48:20] he said but before this body can ever
[2:48:21] become perfected the spirit will bring
[2:48:23] it in submission to god to make you
[2:48:25] it'll war all the time a constant paul
[2:48:28] said we'll never get more than he see
[2:48:30] paul said when i would do good then evil
[2:48:33] is near me see and that's a constant war
[2:48:35] the flesh against the spirit the flesh
[2:48:39] against the spirit and here you go
[2:48:41] looking to the flesh the doctor said i
[2:48:43] believe looks how look how sinful then
[2:48:46] you can't serve god you've got to throw
[2:48:48] aside your senses
[2:48:52] god never give you those senses to trust
[2:48:55] him with
[2:48:57] god didn't give you five senses to
[2:48:59] contact god
[2:49:00] he gave you five senses to contact the
[2:49:02] earth around you
[2:49:05] you wouldn't you couldn't see without
[2:49:07] that that's your that's your a way to
[2:49:09] see to hear
[2:49:10] to think to smell to taste to touch
[2:49:13] he said god never give you those senses
[2:49:15] to trust him with god give you his
[2:49:18] spirit
[2:49:19] to trust him
[2:49:21] your sense is only to contact see taste
[2:49:24] feel smell and hear but to you yourself
[2:49:28] is the spirit that lives in
[2:49:32] you
[2:49:34] huh
[2:49:35] and when that's been regenerated
[2:49:38] and the old man died
[2:49:41] and the new man born again that is a
[2:49:44] part of god
[2:49:47] then you become a son of god
[2:49:51] an offspring
[2:49:53] of the creator
[2:49:55] that's what had adam had in the
[2:49:57] beginning
[2:49:59] but the fall took that from him
[2:50:02] the last adam came to restore all that
[2:50:06] was lost in the first adam can you say
[2:50:09] amen
[2:50:11] then you can believe listen then you can
[2:50:13] believe the impossible things
[2:50:16] because you are made up of a
[2:50:17] miracle-working god you're made up of
[2:50:20] the miracle working god you're a part of
[2:50:26] him
[2:50:28] let's stand
[2:50:30] musicians are coming
[2:50:32] i have much more to say
[2:50:35] but my time is out
[2:50:38] your attention is gone
[2:50:40] we'll meet in the middle
[2:50:42] and close
[2:50:45] all of this is to bring us to a place
[2:50:49] where we can understand that we carry
[2:50:51] something
[2:50:52] that has the potential of being at all
[2:50:56] times connected to the creator
[2:51:00] and we're living below that mean way way
[2:51:02] way way below that privilege
[2:51:05] because we got caught up in the warfare
[2:51:08] hear me
[2:51:10] we get caught up in the warfare
[2:51:12] and god wants us to win this thing we
[2:51:14] must win this battle we must win this
[2:51:18] battle there's a battle to be won and a
[2:51:20] victory is ours
[2:51:23] god has given us everything we need to
[2:51:26] win this battle
[2:51:28] god has given us everything we need to
[2:51:31] win this battle
[2:51:32] god has given us everything we need
[2:51:37] to win this battle
[2:51:39] we just have to use it

[2:51:43] know i was long
[2:51:45] i get it
[2:51:48] you're never going to want me to take a
[2:51:50] vacation
[2:51:53] but the only way i could come home to
[2:51:55] you was to plan my next one
[2:52:00] we need
[2:52:02] some time
[2:52:05] to focus
[2:52:06] on him
[2:52:09] when we can't see the future
[2:52:11] he can
[2:52:13] when we don't see and can't see how it's
[2:52:15] all going to fall together he does
[2:52:18] and sometimes if we let him lift us up
[2:52:21] high
[2:52:22] we can look over the wall
[2:52:24] and see that it may look like chaos on
[2:52:27] every hand but god's got everything

[3:10:09] a prayer over all of us
[3:10:11] i feel like this is a sensitive moment
[3:10:15] and there are needs that god is
[3:10:17] ministering to as we sing
[3:10:20] i believe the lord is doing something
[3:10:22] here
[3:10:23] and i don't want to
[3:10:24] prolong but i don't want to push you out
[3:10:27] either
[3:10:29] i just believe that somebody's faith is
[3:10:31] reaching up right now
[3:10:33] to take a hold i know brother greeley
[3:10:35] worked
[3:10:36] for you and
[3:10:37] with you while i was away but i just
[3:10:39] felt like
[3:10:41] that he might find a place to lead us
[3:10:44] to pray over us right now that god would
[3:10:46] just seal what he's beginning to try to
[3:10:48] do
[3:10:49] in our bodies and in our lives
[3:10:53] may somebody find grace and strength to
[3:10:55] step away
[3:10:58] from what the enemy is using
[3:11:00] to beat them down with
[3:11:05] if we could just turn our eyes to
[3:11:08] calvary
[3:11:10] look upon what the lord has done on our
[3:11:12] behalf
[3:11:14] not allow the enemy to draw our
[3:11:15] attention to other things
[3:11:17] we can have the victory when you're
[3:11:20] finished just dismiss us
[3:11:22] hallelujah offer prayer however you feel
[3:11:25] brother
[3:11:26] i want god to seal something right now
[3:11:29] hallelujah
[3:11:31] [Music]
[3:11:35] lord you have once again come
[3:11:39] and reminded us from your word
[3:11:46] that we are
[3:11:49] a tripartite man
[3:11:51] [Music]
[3:11:52] spirit soul
[3:11:54] and body
[3:11:57] and oh
[3:11:58] we know that we have an accuser and a
[3:12:02] tormentor who comes
[3:12:04] to try
[3:12:06] to pull us away
[3:12:10] from the spirit of the living god that
[3:12:12] dwells inside of us but you in your
[3:12:16] faithfulness
[3:12:17] have come and reminded us
[3:12:20] that the soul this the mind the will and
[3:12:24] the emotions it's not our enemy but oh
[3:12:27] lord how that you by the spirit desire
[3:12:31] to sanctify
[3:12:32] us
[3:12:33] to cleanse us holy completely
[3:12:36] spirit soul and body and lord you were
[3:12:40] right here in your presence today and
[3:12:42] you're dealing with us oh god and you're
[3:12:45] showing us and you're revealing to us by
[3:12:49] the spirit of the living god how that we
[3:12:53] have allowed the soul to rule us to to
[3:12:57] so
[3:12:58] motivate us but oh god our spirit man
[3:13:02] has been has been lacking it's been
[3:13:04] starving because we've not been feeding
[3:13:07] the spirit man properly but oh god as
[3:13:11] you we stand in your presence today and
[3:13:14] you're talking to us lord you're dealing
[3:13:17] with us you're showing us lord things
[3:13:20] have been laid upon the table that we've
[3:13:23] tried to hide that we've tried to push
[3:13:25] down you brought them and laid them back
[3:13:28] up on the table
[3:13:30] and lord i believe that you have a
[3:13:33] surgeon's knife that is able to
[3:13:36] accurately
[3:13:37] meticulously to carve those things out
[3:13:41] of our lives and so lord
[3:13:43] whoever may be here today all of us lord
[3:13:47] we can we can say that's me but god i
[3:13:50] believe that you are specifically
[3:13:53] dealing with men and women in this
[3:13:56] congregation
[3:13:57] perhaps those on the stream also but god
[3:14:00] as you are laying that thing upon the
[3:14:03] table
[3:14:04] revealing it once again may it once and
[3:14:08] for all be dealt with by the spirit of
[3:14:11] the living god
[3:14:14] [Music]
[3:14:15] oh lord
[3:14:19] you are king
[3:14:23] you are surgeon
[3:14:26] you know how to deal with these things
[3:14:29] oh lord
[3:14:30] better than any physician better than
[3:14:32] any doctor
[3:14:34] better than any prescription that has
[3:14:36] ever been written or filled in all of
[3:14:39] time god you know how best to deal with
[3:14:43] these things
[3:14:45] [Music]
[3:14:50] now lord whatever it may be
[3:14:53] any stubbornness that we put forth any
[3:14:56] rebellious part of our character that we
[3:14:58] have put forth to say no that's not me
[3:15:01] anyway god that we have put forth an
[3:15:04] effort to deny what has been spoken
[3:15:06] today that it doesn't apply to us god i
[3:15:09] pray that you would just continue by
[3:15:12] your spirit to pull that thing down and
[3:15:14] expose it piece by piece by piece in the
[3:15:17] name of jesus christ
[3:15:20] [Music]
[3:15:22] lord we're asking you to seal the word
[3:15:25] into our heart into our innermost being

[3:15:33] with all of its humps and bumps
[3:15:36] and and all of the ways that the enemy
[3:15:39] is already plotted to try to stump us
[3:15:42] and to to trip us up god i pray that
[3:15:46] this word would be sealed in even at
[3:15:48] this moment and at what time we don't
[3:15:51] know how to react to the enemy that
[3:15:53] comes to us that this word will come up
[3:15:56] and out of us and that we will use this
[3:15:59] word against our enemy to put him in his
[3:16:02] place and that we would find ourselves
[3:16:06] overcoming anything that the enemy
[3:16:09] places in our path to stumble us
[3:16:13] lord i thank you that you are the victor
[3:16:16] and that you live inside of us
[3:16:19] and that you have not taken your holy
[3:16:21] spirit from us
[3:16:23] but oh lord we are asking that
[3:16:26] reinforcements would come that there
[3:16:28] would be a greater refilling
[3:16:32] overflowing of your spirit inside of us
[3:16:36] that anything that we face lord
[3:16:38] any circumstance
[3:16:41] any drama that would come
[3:16:43] god that we would face it by the spirit
[3:16:46] of the lord
[3:16:48] in the name of the lord jesus christ
