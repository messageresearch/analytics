see what we can come up with God is good he's good all the time haven't we already been blessed we just are so happy to see you in the house of the Lord we know that his strength is our strength his strength is made perfect in our weakness Amen Let the redeemed of the Lord do what say something about it amen so God is good we want to thank every one of you who have been praying for us this week we have certainly needed your prayers and uh mother was taken from the nursing facility to the emergency room on Wednesday and uh didn't get a room until about 11 o'clock Wednesday night but really she was she was not in the hallway in the emergency room she was in a in a bay and she was actually getting tests faster there than she would have if she'd been in a room so the Lord knows everything and she was extremely dehydrated and she had been pocketing food and not swallowing and uh show her sodium levels were very very high and her blood pressure very low and of course she was confused as always but when something is going on and you can't communicate you know properly I'm sure it's even more frustrating so I have spent all day Thursday all day Friday and all day yesterday in the hospital and she is not improving she is most likely getting ready to see the Lord most likely and that really really Thrills my heart it does yesterday day before yesterday she was asleep most of the day very very groggy so much so that we double checked to see if they had given her something to make her so sleepy she slept so sound and so loudly all day long for we couldn't even hardly wake her up for the kids when they came and uh but yesterday she was not so sleepy she was more alert and she spoke some words of English a lot of times since the stroke in 2019 it's just been kind of mumbling that you can't quite make out but yesterday she said some clear things at different times and one of those things was she said oh I am so ready to go and I said mother are you ready to go home she said No Heaven so clear so clear and that was a great comfort to my heart of course it was I've grieved my mother now since the first stroke and so it doesn't feel quite the same as if it had not been such a drawn out process but as sister shoshana sung this morning who who am I you know to question God's will and his way so uh we will see how things go but her blood pressure was uh 80 over 38. and has been lower than that and she was in some pain yesterday from probably laying in the bed unable to do a lot of moving around and they're not able at this moment in the hospital at least to give her much for pain because it lowers your blood pressure and so uh God willing we will transfer her to hospice care tomorrow where she will be uh comfortable they will be able to address those things but it means that she's transitioning and it means that her long battle with dementia Hallelujah it's almost done and uh her mind will be clear and will be sharp again and she will know as she is known and the truth is we're almost home anyway we're almost home anyway so thank you for your prayers your texts your calls um I've been a little slack in answering a non-related text and calls but uh forgive me it's just not easy to take a lot of calls in the hospital because if I talk she stirs and she's wondering who's talking and what are they saying you know she just gets very fidgety um but I've had some wonderful expressions of love and concern that have meant so much to me and I haven't slept and so I was pretty tired this morning coming in coming over and I was met with a beautiful basket thank you sister it'll be all right I'm right sister Rebecca and Maya had Maya had made a beautiful card and and a beautiful basket of goodies and uh wonderful things and it really it meant something to me you always appreciate somebody doing something nice but in a moment like that it was just a real my mother doesn't need flowers she wouldn't know they were there she doesn't need anything like that I've told anybody who asked please don't spend your money on that she didn't like cut flowers anyway so why would she want them now why do you why do they want to waste them and cut them off like that so they die she didn't have a green thumb either so anyway most of her flowers were artificial I even had a friend who reached out yesterday or Friday he reached out Friday and he said brother Shelley I will come I will pay my own ticket and I will come and sit with you you don't have to talk you won't have to answer any spiritual questions I'll just come and sit in the room with you and you know that meant so much to me that someone would think of something like that several of you have offered to come and sit with Mother sister Alfreda sister Anita in different ones we appreciate that so much it has not been needed just yet but we'll see what the future holds I am hoping that in the next few hours uh the Home gate opens and that is all in God's hands isn't it I'm trying to get it out well we have birthdays this week not mine tomorrow Jennifer Jernigan has a birthday she's not here this morning because her usually non-romantic husband her rather average husband oh if I'm not crying I can laugh laughing will help me especially if I'm picking on Chad but he surprised her with the getaway and I love that and I just pray that they have a great time and and the kids have done okay I asked them had they been fighting he said no we haven't was it Luke I was talking to he said no we've not been fighting I'm glad of that sister Jada has a birthday tomorrow as well she's here somewhere God bless sister Jada on her birthday make sure you sisters hug her neck and let her know that you hope she has the best birthday ever and then on Thursday of this week sister Rachel Christian has a birthday and uh so we want to wish her a happy birthday today it's birthday week and another person who's very special to me has a birthday on Thursday Sister Janice green turns 88. she's still doing well she I spoke with her a few weeks ago a couple weeks ago on the phone and she was strong and I just pray that the Lord will bless her with a good day on her birthday this week and then the next on Saturday that's Thursday on Saturday brother Billy Tebow has a birthday so we want to say happy birthday to him and also one of our long time streamers Brother David Edwards has a birthday and those were all I saw if I I really looked in a hurry so if I missed you and you're here you can speak up I didn't mean to miss anybody but sometimes I do but we'll try to catch you on your birthday and say something isn't the Lord good well I feel like singing something although we've had a lot an hour of singing now but I yeah brother Daniel did so good on his song

going to burst wide open when the angel sets my spirit free and I'll take a flight oh like jks used to say death ain't no big deal it is a doorway the prophet of God said it's just a doorway we're we're just going through a changing room now this is not the reality that is to come there is a reality we're walking in the negative that's the positive these Saints who have gone before us they're walking in the positive and they're wondering why we're having such a hard time down here with the negative they say if you could just see what we see if you could hear what we hear experience what we experience you'd never get cold you'd never get backslid you'd run all the way my little great aunt used to sing that I'd Lord I'd be willing to run all the way if I falter while I'm trying don't be angry let me stay Lord I'd be willing to run all the way some of us have run all the way there are some in this room that have never stopped running that's right you know that's something to celebrate they've never stopped running when they said yes to the Lord they realized then there was nothing to look back to nothing to look back to they asked me this week did your mother ever smoke I said she sure did did she ever drink she sure did I said she cussed pretty bad too the doctor didn't care about that he said well how long ago was that I said 1985 middle of the summer 1985. he said well how would you remember that I said that's because the Lord met her he met her and saved her soul and she never did that again boy those doctors there were two doctors and a bunch of a bunch of student doctors there interns there their eyes got big open the the little doctor one from Haiti she she looked up and she said I know what you're talking about he said I know what you're talking about Hallelujah okay Romans chapter 6 I'm going to give you a a heads up my uh phone is on and uh if for some reason I would need to take a phone call then I'll just take it and you'll just be praying while I do and we'll get right back in here all right let's read so you can be seated again may God bless every one of these precious streamers we we had a little hiccup there on YouTube I mean on Facebook but I think they've got a link posted and uh God bless sister Ethel in the UK who is asking prayer for her granddaughter 22 months old in the hospital on oxygen very poorly needs a touch from the Lord father would you reach right now to the United Kingdom would you touch that precious little 22 month old child precious little girl You Are the Healer you're the wonderful physician you're more than able to heal her body to raise her up as a testimony that Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever he changes not to God be the glory to God be the glory to God be the glory bless all of you Romans 6. verse 1 what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that Grace May abound God forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein no you're not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into uh-uh I didn't hear you into his death into his death didn't say into his life said into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death what are we baptized into death is that clear is that clear to you do you understand that we are baptized into unto his death we're joining with him in death baptism in the water is a type it is a spiritual type of what's taking place in the spirit realm we are being baptized with water in the natural uh but we are looking for another baptism which is one by the spirit a spirit baptism and spiritually we enter into his death when we obey his word by baptism or by whatever means we choose to say yes to the word of God every yes is for a purpose every yes to the Lord is for a reason that like hurry [Music] foreign therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk how in newness of life there there must be death before there can be a resurrection we have to enter into his death before we can enter into his resurrection we can't have a new life until the old life is dead if you understand that say man all right verse 5 for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we are fellowshipping in his death baptized into his death we are cooperating with him in his death planted together we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection wonderful powerful words the next verse knowing this that our old man I don't hear you it's crucified with him how many times was he crucified just once and so when he was crucified that's what the word says but that ain't how the preacher be I'm not asking you how the preacher preaches I'm asking you what the word said he said knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be the body of sin destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin if you're serving sin you didn't die there's no need in graying it out or compromising it if you're still serving unbelief living in doubt instead of living in faith then you've not died you don't get another opportunity to die so what do I do brother you remember that you have joined with him in his death let him have his perfect way in your life until you're dead quit squirming just die you know here's your problem here's my problem the two only two great forces in the whole wide world and they both want us dead the Devil Wants You Dead your papa wants you dead you can't afford to stay alive for he that is dead is freed you got to be dead he that is dead is freed from sin well I don't think that's what it means brother Shelley well I didn't know he had any theologians here this morning I didn't know we had any DDS here this morning all I know is what it says the holy spirit is here to tell us what it means all I know is what it says for he that is dead is freed from sin next verse now if we be dead with Christ it's not our own death it's are we Dead with Christ we believe that we shall also do what live with him you may be seated may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word I want you to rest but I don't want you to get quiet I don't want you to go comatose I slept less than three hours last night I can be here because of him I don't know what your circumstances are but you can be here because of him and his word is what's going to get us through this afternoon it's what's going to get us up in the morning it's how we're going to make it through the week it's by fellowshipping in his word where are we now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him verse 9 knowing that Christ being raised from the dead which death are we talking about the only one he only died once he was only smitten once he did such an excellent and complete job he never has to die again I know there's been this unusual emphasis at times around the message that has almost de-emphasized the blood I don't understand that you say well brother Branham said well we're basing brother random was basing what he said on the word and Grace without Grace no one is saved he said have you met Grace have you met Amazing Grace how many of you can say yes I've met her but you must understand that without the blood Grace is empty there has to be a price there has to be a token for Redemption there has to be the shedding of blood so Grace became the transportation it became the truck that got the blood to your house but if the blood had not arrived you are still dead had the blood not gotten to your house you are still lost because the blood is the very life of God and without the life of God you have an expiration date you can't live eternally without the life of God so don't de-emphasize the blood somebody asked me one time around the message do you really think you ought to sing those songs about the blood knowing what the prophet said I said absolutely because I know what the word said we're not saved by works we're saved by grace but without the shedding of blood there is no remission for sins so I want you to understand that Grace was the transportation that got the token price of God's blood to you Grace brought it to you in your condition you couldn't have gotten to the blood on your own the blood had to come to you his hand had to reach farther down than you and I could reach up we could have never gotten to Grace we could have never gotten to the blood but Grace delivered the token life of the blood to you met you right in the gutter he brought you from the gutter most to the uttermost met you right in your sin right in your bondage right in your addiction right in your filth the blood found you there because Grace got it to you so you're saved by grace because you had to get the blood the token price had to get to where you are but do not de-emphasize the power of the blood of God for without that blood there is no hope for salvation and you'll find that balance is very well in the message of the hour how dare you take a few quotations out of context and de-emphasize the blood the bride will never stand for that we'll never stand for that we'll never stand for that because we know it's the blood that changes us yes we understand that we want to emphasize the blood I want to sing about it I want to talk about it but I also want to understand that there was a Chasm between us and the blood we had to have some way of getting it to where we were praise God I hope you're getting that knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion over him he's not ruled by Death he's not restrained by Death he conquered death he defeated death if you believe that amen for in that he died he died unto sin once that was enough but in that he liveth he liveth unto God it says he lives eternally died one time but lives eternally he doesn't just live forever he lives eternally eternity is longer than forever how many of you know that amen all right he goes on likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed to sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so we're dead and yet we live because we understand the power of his reproducible resurrection this resurrection that is for us it was his resurrection but in the same manner he chose to share his death with us he chooses to share his his life with us by the power of the resurrection and now verse 12 the last verse let not sin therefore reign in your dyable body your mortal body one day the body that you live in now is going to die it is a mortal body and your mortal body you are not to allow unbelief to Reign to rule to influence your decisions while you're living in the Mortal body you know the only sin is unbelief isn't that right all of these other things are the attributes of sin people drink and smoke and cuss and commit adultery and fornication and perversion and do all the things they do because somewhere in their life there is unbelief if you really believe that he is who he says he is and that he did what he said he did and that he's doing what he said he's doing then you are dying with him you are fellowshipping his death and your unbelief dies when the rest of you dies and you say I believe Lord help my unbelief I believe Lord I believe help my unbelief if unbelief ever Rises up and you can't think of Sister shoshana's song this morning and you you're just battling in the mind then you have to press your way back into the word and you have to take God at his word and say wait a minute doesn't matter how I feel doesn't matter how I think doesn't matter what it looks like all that matters is what the word has said so don't let sin reign in your mortal body that you should obey the lust thereof are you with me good I'm going to ask you a hundred more times now once you go to Psalms we got to hurry because I haven't introduced my subject yet Psalm 139 verse 16 and 18 in the Amplified Bible and if you have a problem with that plug your ears because I'm going to read it out of the Amplified anyhow your eyes saw my unformed substance and in your book thank you sister Kathy all the days I want to emphasize that not that we haven't already but I won't emphasize that all the days a double l means all that's all all means all make sure you understand that all means all I know we like to say all kinds of little fun things with words and we like to say the whosoever will doesn't mean whosoever will and we like to say all that but please be aware of this all means all it is without exception all of your days without exception were written they were written before ever they took shape when as yet there was none of them before you ever breathed your first breath on planet Earth your life story had already been written in the mind of God and that's why nothing panics him That's why nothing causes him anxiety and nothing catches him by surprise if you and I could read the book of our life we would be ready for anything but he has not given us that Grace to know what's on every page of every day of our life but he knows everything your sin your unbelief the attributes of your unbelief he knew all of that he knew your drug use he knew you're whoring around he knew every bit of it he saw it all it was all written down it was all recorded he knew it you know what's so fascinating about that he loved you anyway he watched over you anyway he pursued you anyway he didn't see you as dirty he thought you were worth saving [Music] no one ever knew you like your papa knows you and yet he thought you were worth saving he went all the way to the Cross because he wanted you how many of you have ever become so frustrated with somebody you just said I'm done with him I may or may not have said it this week I'm done with him I'm done with her glad that even on the worst page of your life your papa never said such a thing as that about you he saw your days of confusion he saw your days of blindness he saw your days of hypocrisy he saw your day before you were ever fully formed in your mother's belly all the days of your life written in his book when as yet none of them had begun to happen now either you believe that or you don't you don't get to change your mind midstream you either believe that or you don't believe that and if you believe that you will understand that all things how many things all things work together I'll get to that in a minute all things verse 17 how precious and weighty also that word weighty is valuable how valuable also are your thoughts to me oh God how vast is the sum of them all of God's thoughts about you are written in the book of your life and yet this room would not hold the thoughts that he has thought about you he has thought about you so often so many times with such love with such care with such compassion that if every one of his thoughts about you were written down on pages of paper this room perhaps would not be able to hold the volumes if every thought he'd ever had I'm just it's what he said how precious and weighty also are your thoughts to me o God how vast is the sum of them Verse 18 if I could count them if I could count them they would be more in number than the sand every little grain of sand on every beach in the entire world and all the sand underneath thee ocean and all the sand on Sand Mountain Alabama where they grow those amazing tomatoes and all the sandy soil of this nation if all of that sin was gathered together you might begin to get an idea of how many times the Lord had thought about you now you may be wondering about now how does he have time to think about anybody else he's God he doesn't live in time he lives in eternity and because are you with me and because he is eternal let me just give you this example here or let me just give you this little uh a warning here you better amen now you better get in here now because it's about to get tight I haven't announced my subject yet it's going to get tight in a minute so this is your chance to let loose shout amen smile get in here because in a minute some of your stuff it's going to be laid out in here you you're going to be quiet then if I could count them there would be more in number than the sand when I awoke could I count to the end I would still be with you powerful I would still be with you I want to read you Romans 8 I was going to do that later but I want to read you Romans 8 28 in the Amplified you've memorized it I'm sure in the King James but in the Amplified it says we are assured and no this is good oh this is so good you got to hear it this way we are assured and know that God being a partner in their labor God is partnering with all things in your life and all the things of your life and all the days of your life and all the thoughts of your life were written in his book before you were ever formed fully in your mother's womb and now God is partnering in labor with all things making sure that all things work together he's making sure that all things work together he's making sure that all things work together and are fitting are you with me punch your neighbor wake him up you don't I will making sure that all things work together and are fitting into a plan just remember it's a plan that you have already in eternity past said amen to you would know what you know had you not agreed you'd be trapped in denominationalism which is the mark of the beast somebody said I'm waiting on the mark of the beast to be no no no no no no that Antichrist Spirit has been in the earth since the time of Christ the word said so the mark of the beast is not a future reality it is a present reality we're not looking for a tattoo on your hand or one on your forehead we understand that by joining yourselves in League in Union with a lie makes you under a delusion that right hand of Fellowship means joining in partnership with something that God has rejected God has rejected denominationalism I wish you'd say Amen he's not only rejected it he has cursed it there's a Remnant that is still hid in error waiting on the bride waiting on the adoption of sons waiting on you and I to begin to rise up and do what we're here to do we're here to finish the king's business the bride is not here to look pretty on the Shelf the bride is here to finish the bridegroom's business [Music] if God needed William Branham to finish his business on Earth he would have never taken him from the scene brother Branham did exactly what God called him to do he introduced a people to the bridegroom the Lord Jesus Christ and then he prayed the prayer of John the Baptist may I decrease many churches many Believers have failed to let that prayer be a reality because they are holding on to humanity you can't hold on to humanity you have to hold on to the bridegroom choose a company Three's a Crowd it's you and the bridegroom in the bridal chamber it's not you and your pastor and the bridegroom it's not you and the prophet and the bridegroom it's not you and a modern day apostle and the bridegroom it's got to be you in the bridegroom you wouldn't even know how to get in there if God hadn't sent a friend of the bridegroom we wouldn't know how to get to Christ if we hadn't heard the word like we did the very fact that you have heard the word and to the best of your ability have embraced it as the truth and caused your life to line up with it to me is proof that God is partnering with all things in your life he's bringing all things together they are fitting into a plan and in the end it is for your good the Amplified said for good to and for those who love God and are called according to his design and purpose all things work together for the good of them that love the Lord to them that are the called according to his purpose if you believe that's amen have you ever had a day that you didn't believe that have you ever had a moment that you wondered about that have you ever had a minute that you conveniently tried to forget that I'm so glad that God is Not schizophrenic I'm so glad that God doesn't need medication he doesn't have a split personality he said all things this thing must surely be from the devil well let me tell you something the devil couldn't get to you [Music] except that it's a part of all things sickness all things heartache all things marriage difficulty all things betrayals all things hurts and wounds and Scar are you with me all things let me hear the church say all things I want to make sure that we understand that I want you to go to Galatians 2. I haven't started preaching yet Galatians 2 20. I I've been shut up in a hospital room all week I'm just glad to see somebody that's not dressed in Scrubs I am crucified this is King James I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me that's powerful but wait till you hear this and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me allow me just to paraphrase here I am crucified with Christ I died when Christ died yet I live but the life that I now live is not my old life my old life died it died before it was ever born because you remember that Christ was not crucified first at Calvary he was first crucified where in the mind of God before there ever was a Calvary Christ was crucified in the mind of God now it had to happen in the Earth because whatever happens in eternity has to break through into time so that you and I who are creatures of the time can break back forth into that which is eternal because you are born eternal somebody said how could you say something like that because you are of the seed of Christ if the seed of Christ is in you that which is eternal has already been demonstrated in your life so even before your experience I know this is going to be a stretch for some but even before you experienced God encountered God there was already something Eternal laying in you now if you believe I'm not preaching the message I can I don't I didn't bring any quotes today but I love them all but I'll make one here brother random talks about the woman at the well having the seed of God in her now when did she get the seed of God when she joined the church did she get the seed of God before she had a husband of course she did think about what you're listening to when did she get the seed of God when she joined the church when she got saved when she went to the altar oh but the random said she came here with the representation of God in her how is that possible because before she was ever born God saw all of her days and every thought that he had ever had toward her was already written in his book God knew that the first husband wouldn't satisfy the second husband wouldn't satisfy the third husband wouldn't satisfied you have well said you've had five husbands and the one you have now is not your own God saw every bit of that he wrote down every name first it'll be Harry and then it'll be Joe and it'll be God knew every one of her husband's name he knew all about her and he said all things are going to work together in her life so that I can be most glorified you see he's jealous to him I said wait a minute God is a jealous God he's going to have his reward in you he's going to have his reward in you I would resist whatever you're going through right now in this moment if it's sleepiness I would resist it if it's nausea I would resist it my family can tell you I could hardly get dressed this morning because I was so nauseated because I was heaving trying to get my shirt on I was heaving trying to get over here heaving but I knew that I had to be here I think some people run from what they ought to stand against we don't need to run from the Roar we need to run toward the Roar brother sister anything worth having in God is worth fighting to get you choose whether you stay engaged in a service or not not the circumstances of your week you're not the only tired one you're not the only one that's worked hard this week somebody else sitting beside you is fighting that sleepy spirit but they must fight it you must fight it off because there's a truth here that God wants you to get before I ever announce my subject I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me brother Branham said she sat on her mother's knee and she heard the stories of the exploits of a living God and every one of those thoughts and those wonderful stories began to Lodge itself and the only way that word could Lodge itself in her is because there was a representation there and the only reason why there was a reputation excuse me a representation there is because God foreknew her and by his foreknowledge he knew her choice because she didn't just make it on the earth she made it in eternity he knew her choice and so he let those words so seeds began to be sewn into her it found a lodging place because there was a representation there and brother Brandon even tells some of the stories that are that are that her mother told her like like the like the thief like the spies to Rahab she knew about the prostitute she knew about the prostitute that God used placed her in the lineage of Christ she knew about it and so all these things she goes out searching to satisfy this longing of her heart and she goes from one to husband two to three to four to five and then she's got one that doesn't belong to her and he doesn't satisfy either and I have preached to you for years that what she was longing for was not found in man number one two three four five or six but everything she ever needed in her life was found in the seventh man and the seventh man is not brother Branham the seventh man is Christ the angel of the Covenant is not a prophet the angel of the Covenant is a savior he's both Creator and savior I hope you catch that all right he goes on uh uh uh the life I now live let me read this in the Amplified let's Amplified and then we might announce our subject here in a minute I have been crucified with Christ we'll make sure you're reading it I know how you all cheat some of you is already through the verse in him I have then what in the world did Paul mean when he said I Die daily I'll tell you exactly what he meant he meant every day of my life I have to go back and place myself in the crucifixion of Christ so that my flesh will obey the word and not not my soul not my mind and my will and my emotions I Die daily I take myself all the way back to my death the one I had before I was born say somebody said isn't that out of order God's order is not man's order anyway we're talking about eternity and time now so don't get confused with him brother Branham says it clearly remember I mentioned this recently he said I was with Paul Revere last Sunday I think I mentioned it I was with Paul Revere well he wasn't really in the natural with Paul Revere but he said he identified himself as being with Paul Revere because he said I'm an American and and he said I was with Washington when he took the boat across the Chile Delaware whatever whatever I love it I've read it many many many times but he don't stop there he said and I was with Christ in the garden and I was with him at Calvary when the soldier pushed that spear in his side and butter blood and water flowed I was with him as his body lay in that cold dark grave but his Spirit man went down into the heart of the Earth [Music] to capture the keys of death hell and the grave to lead captivity captive and to make a five-fold Ministry possible in the Earth he went after the Ascension gifts this is what the word says he stopped over into Paradise and he revealed himself where the random said he interrupted a testimony meeting that was going on Ezekiel had been testifying I saw him as a wheel in the middle of a wheel he said Shadrach Meshach and Abednego they had testified I saw him as a fourth man in the fire I don't know David said I saw him this way that way or the other as a shepherd on the hills of Israel I don't know exactly who was talking but all of a sudden they didn't have to describe him anymore because he stepped right into Paradise one of the most Saints said various powerful there he is that's the one I saw Shadrach said that's him Daniel said that's the one that kept the lion's mouth closed all night Ezekiel said that's the one who stood as a wheel in the middle of the wheel and then he and and so that that's without the blood Those Old Testament Saints couldn't have eternal life without the blood of Christ they didn't get in that way they got in under the blood of a covenant of bulls and goats and but they couldn't go into eternity that way they were caught in Paradise in the realm of time but when cry oh when Christ made himself known and they recognized who he was they accepted what he had done Where Have You Been master mask where have you been and he began to tell them I was hanging on a cross my blood has been shed for your Redemption that's what they said what you just said is what they said so be it so be it so be it amen amen amen and then he said okay then come with me come with me scripture tells us he emptied out paradise somebody said where's that Matthew and many of the Saints just reading scripture now and many of the Saints which slept the rose many who had already died Resurrected and walked again the streets of Jerusalem is that what the word says not a one-man Resurrection but a many membered body Resurrection because Christ was the first fruits of the Resurrection all those other Saints could resurrect with him are you with me I know it's getting late not really all the rest of those Saints resurrected with him they began to walk the streets of Jerusalem can you imagine you're walking down to the market and all of a sudden you look up and there is ant flossy just think about it you better think about it you better think about it because it's about to happen that way again she said flossy is that you she's been dead 20 years what is happening oh there's my neighbor there's that crazy old man down the road walking down the street as fit as a fiddle as alive as he ever was what if the world has happened Christ had emptied out paradise Those Old Testament Saints had now said amen to the New Covenant that God had sealed with his own blood and for a quick short period of time they walked the streets of Jerusalem as a testimony that a better Covenant had been served [Music] a better one one that is eternal the old Covenant was temporal because this the the sacrifice of the Lamb or the ram was only good until it expired that that sin offering until you sinned again that atonement until you till the next year came a long time for atonement every one of those offerings of that old testament old testament old Covenant every one of those offerings had an expiration and you had to keep doing it again doing it that's where that's where the Pentecostals get it we got to go back and do it again got to go back and do it again gotta go back do it again gotta go back and do it again gotta go back and do it again if I had a dollar for every time I ever heard him quote as a boy repent and do your first work so repent and do your first work so repent and do your first works over repent do it first verse over so all we knew how to do is repent and be baptized again under titles it wasn't going to save us anyway hello because they were caught up in the spirit of a covenant that was not enough but when his blood was shed it's Eternal there's no expiration date on that offering he never has to die again he'll never have to bleed again you hear me he'll never have to bleed again once was enough and I want you to know the reason why we even mentioned that and it's not in my notes and it's not in my subject but the reason why we mention it is because we are told and I believe that as the first resurrection was so shall be the second we don't believe that the Rapture is it's a twinkling of an eye we believe that that is a description of a suddenly but we believe that the coming of the Lord through the resurrection Rapture is a process that is already unfolding the Lord has already ascended it descended in his word a shout has gone out to gather a bridal people come on the voice of the Archangel is sounding even now if you have an ear to hear it he's talking even now if you have an ear to hear it and the last Trump will be the last and brother sister we're coming into that hour just before that last Trump people won't like this but I can't tell you the day of the hour but I can tell you the season it won't be Passover he finished that it'll be around the fall feast it'll be around the it'll be around Rosh Hashanah it'll be around tabernacle's time it'll be around the day of atonement that that that that season there we know that because it's the only Trump that hasn't yet been fulfilled just before that changing of our body the glory of the Lord so rich in the Earth the Bride of Jesus Christ speaking with the authority of her adoption by the power of the creative word missing limbs are being restored among the people somebody said how will they beat the media off I don't think anybody has any problem believing that we won't have to deal with the media in such a move as that because they're going to be too busy over there covering phony politics they are not going to have time to see what a what a little group of people scattered around the world are doing by speaking legs back into place and should somebody come along and catch it well it won't be much because they will I want you to know they will laugh they will laugh they already mock now they'll really mock then you just let somebody somebody said I don't even believe that's possible then you don't understand who the Creator is do you because he already placed he already placed tokens of his reproducible resurrection in the natural in the earth even certain species of starfish when the leg breaks off or an arm or whatever you call it then another one has the ability to regenerate and build itself nerves can repair and build bones get anything anywhere cells divide so don't you tell me that God can't do it you said well I really believe then you won't because if you don't believe now if you don't believe God can do it now you won't believe it when he does it it's Faith it's by faith these things operate not by sight there will be so many blinded to it there'll be those who ride up in their magazines you know what phone needs those people are I know he really had a leg I know it's just a some kind of camera trick the little bride will never even miss a Beat because it's not going to be a world thing it's not going to be a public show it's going to be the final confirmation of Who You Are quick short work you'll look up one hour as God begins to move and breathe that way in his people and you'll wake up one hour and you'll see sister Tebow you look up in Tremaine you look up and see sister Burgess oh I can't believe such as that then you don't understand what the Rapture Resurrection is all about many of the Saints which slept the rose and walked again the streets of Jerusalem but the random said it'll be just like it was in that first time it'll happen that way again and the dead in Christ even the scripture says even the scripture says imagine that the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together meet him in there the church is the one who put in the in in some gap of time there or tried to interpret that in some other way it's not just a sequence it means what it says the dead in Christ shall rise first I dreamed it in the early 90s I dreamed it I had buried a sister in my granny's Church I had come home to preach the message I had baptized her sister Eileen Smith I had baptized her in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ she had been a trinitarian Holiness woman her whole life she received the message of the hour she was baptized in the name of Jesus shortly thereafter diagnosed with incurable cancer and left here so suddenly she never got feeble she never got weak it took her so quickly God let the truth come in just the right hour he let her get the right baptism in just the right hour and then he took her home well I buried her and I stood was only Christian at her funeral except a few that were with me and I preach the truth to her family and told them I'm not going to stand here and tell you that you'll see your mother again because the reality is you won't living the way you live so you better get a good Glimpse today before they close that box for the last time but if you have any hope of ever seeing her again it'll be because you have given your heart to the Lord Jesus Christ you've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and filled with the Holy Ghost in Fire and then you can have hope that you'll see your mother again you'll say well that must have got really mad at you are you kidding I wouldn't have said it if the Holy Ghost hadn't been there to say it I began to just offer an opportunity for prayer and and nearly the whole family started calling on the Lord shortly thereafter I went to bed one night I think it was a dream things happened in the night sometimes their dreams sometimes they're night visions sometimes their experiences sometimes they're more real than you sitting in front of me today so we might not always call it the right thing and understand exactly how it came but it came it was like a dream I saw myself sitting in the old Fellowship Hall of the church in Columbus where sister Smith went to church and someone we were working we were doing some things in the fellowship hall and somebody said brother Shelley there's someone here to see you I said well by all means send them in and they began to come down those steps Around The Landing in the old church and walk down into the fellowship hall where it was and it was Sister Smith standing there young and radiant and beautiful and very recognizable I know exactly how I felt my heart seemed to stop I lost my breath I ran toward where she was and before I knew it I did in the natural what I had in the dream what I had never done in the natural I'd never hugged her neck I'd never embraced her that way I had always respectfully shook her hand but before I knew what I had done I had thrown my arms around her and laid my head over on her chest and I never said one time in that dream oh Lord I hope this is real now I know what you mean I just screamed out this this it's here you say well that was just a dream yes but it wasn't a dream that day in Jerusalem and it won't be the dream the next time it happens you mark them as they leave you mark them as they leave to join the great cloud of witnesses let me tell you something they without us they'll never enter into the fullness of their inheritance until you do the dead in Christ shall rise first all right now it's 107. how much more time do I have if you need to slip out we understand you can certainly go I don't know if I can do this Justice in the time that I have but I'm going to try I'm going to have to read some of it is that all right you're going to stay with me let me see did I finish that verse no didn't did I did I finish Galatians 2 20 and Amplified no I have been crucified with Christ in him I have shared his crucifixion it is no longer I who live but Christ the Messiah lives in me and the life I now live in the body I live how by faith in by adherence to and Reliance on and I heard Josh this morning during worship saying I Trust You Lord I Trust You Lord I Trust You Lord you we better because all of our days were written in his book before any of them ever came to be nobody has the master plan like he does nobody knew what was coming like he does nobody knows how it's going to turn out like he does I'm not sure if I want to hit this or not complete trust in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself up for me are you with me I want to talk to you from my heart I want you to listen carefully now this is what the lord gave me and I had to get to this place where I could share this I'm one of those believers I'm done thank you for the scripture I'm one of those believers who has been grievously mistreated by other believers it's gonna be quiet now I told you it was coming I told you amen while you can I've been grievously mistreated by other believers ever since I started the journey from the time I was seven years old filled with the Holy Ghost he placed a gift in my life that caused me lots and lots of problems and people love that gift as long as it was telling them their problems or or what they needed or or some detail that could help build their faith but when it began to expose their sin and their lifestyle and their hypocrisy they weren't so happy with me it started shortly after I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost it followed me through Pentecost it followed me through Holiness movement it followed me into the message of the hour I feel misunderstood I have been rejected I have been maligned I've had the truth told about me that hurt I've had lies told about me are you here I'm one of those I'm one of those who knows what it's like to be rejected by your own by your own family by your own church family and I'm not alone because most of you are one of those somewhere along your Christian Journey somebody in the church some other Christian has maligned you misunderstood you hold on rejected you lied about you sometimes they told the hurtful truth about you maybe it didn't have to be told I want to know if there's anybody in here that can relate to my story maybe you like me has found it very difficult through the years to deal with it it's easy to say I forgive it's a whole lot harder to forget it anybody with me but if you're looking for truth and you're looking for healing you can have it you can be healed can overcome your crippling battles you can place your broken Twisted feet under the master's table and be whole again but not until you are willing to acknowledge the true source of your crucifying experience you're going to have to know where it really come from who really is the instigator of your crucifixion the herd of one Christian being cruel to another Christian is severe it's the deepest pain because we expect the best treatment from our Brothers and Sisters in Christ we expect the world to misunderstand us but we expect the church the other believers to embrace us if anybody should understand the difficult life that we are called to live in holiness it should be our brothers and sisters in the church in the body not just the local body but the body of Christ Universal the pain from such harsh treatment could leave us affected for the rest of our lives until we make up our mind to climb out I'm inviting you today and you that stream and you that archive I'm inviting you to climb out because there were many Christians who lost their natural lives they were publicly literally crucified or murdered there was ironius and polycarp and John the Baptist and Paul and Peter and Huss and Tyndale and hundreds of thousands more countless others who lost their lives all by the hands of religious men it wasn't by atheists it wasn't by agnostics it was by Christians that many have been crucified the Catholic Church they like to call themselves the heartbeat the very womb of Christianity and history tells us that not one single organism or Army in the history of the world has murdered more men and women not by the communist Army not by Hitler's regime no one has killed more Christians than the Roman Catholic Church they were quite literally crucified by Christians can you say Amen you might say it was in name only we're not here to make those judgments we're just here to say they didn't consider themselves or identify themselves with a heathen or with the lost or with the agnostic or with the atheists they believe they were the church the mother Church the holy church they believe that they spoke for Christ and what they did they did at the beckoning of Christ and so when Catholic Crusaders marched into Jerusalem and crucified Jews on crosses when men like Martin Luther even raised up and said all the Christ Killers be damned they did it in the name of religion so you are not alone you also have been hurt and wounded and betrayed by the hands of religious men many of these times in our life we have moved on from and we no longer have to look at our crucifiers our circles have changed our fellowship has changed our church has changed but some of us every single service must face must sing with must worship with must pray with and pray for the very men and women who nailed us to the cross I didn't say that so that you would feel sorry for anybody here I did it simply to remind you you're not alone maybe you moved on to another family maybe you moved on to another church maybe some of this is so far behind you you don't ever want to think about it unless you realize in some way it has crippled you but some of us we don't have the same privilege of being able to leave it all behind we can't change jobs we can't change careers we can't get away from it by changing churches it follows us everywhere we go the Deep wounds foreign heard the message of the hour I knew it was the perfect word and I thought that the most perfect people in all the world should be gathered around and I believed they were I believed they were I literally sincerely believed they were and my honeymoon lasted at least 30 days it's going to be quiet and what I come to find out is the place that possesses the most truth will be plagued overrun by the most hate field bitter spiteful hypocritical people somebody said wouldn't you like to live in Jeffersonville no sir re there's no City in the earth that experience more demons cast out than the city of Jeffersonville when I have had need to pass through I pass through quickly usually with lots of prayer on the few occasions that I've ever had to spend the night there I pray over my room I cast out all the deity spirits apply all the man worshiping spirits I don't want to lay my children down in a room where those Spirits have been I want to purify it I do you can ask my amendment I do I believe I pray because if all those demon Spirits were cast out of that place you know what they didn't all go back to hell where they come from they like to linger they like to twist they like to instigate crucifixions of those who believe that they're still a five-fold Ministry who believe that God still speaks to pastors and Prophets and apostles and teachers and evangelists those who believe that it's a little bit more involved than press play and obey so all those demon Spirits they like to crucify and there they don't go very far and they will anoint anybody who who wants to be anointed so some of my hardest battles and most bloody experiences were not in denominational Pentecost I have lost more blood and received more wounds at the hands of men and women who claim to believe this end time message than I ever had in any of the other movements that God brought me through on my way to the truth and yet in all of that I cannot remain bitter I cannot spend my Ministry attacking them I must speak the truth today because there are those who need to be brought out but I cannot dedicate my life to criticizing other churches or other movements or other Ministries it is not the plan of God it is not the will of God it will destroy our lives we must simply realize it was not them when I tell you that I for one go to church today worship today preached to today men and women who have crucified me I'm telling you the truth but I'm telling you it wasn't them I can't excuse their sin and I'll tell you why this was the scripture the Lord said read this lest anybody get the idea that because it was God using you to throw stones lest anybody get the idea that we can now say well it was God's will to crucify my pastor so it's okay that he used me that's extreme Calvinism to the Primitive Baptist who in the mountains of West Virginia and Carolina would blow a man's head off with a shotgun and say he was predestinated to do it being a part or a play or a piece in God's predestinated plan does not excuse us for our unkindness for the lies we've told for the rumor somebody said my you seem like you're trying to take care of local church businesses I'm not at all and that's not even what this message is about but I I love transparency I see it so rarely in the body of Christ I see it even rarer among ministers so it anoints me and behooves me I want to be more transparent if you can't follow a broken wounded man who's on his way to Restoration if you can't relate to somebody who's been through some hard things and made some big mistakes along the way who will you be able to relate to you can't follow a parent who didn't always get it right who you relate to we should be transparent with one another but nobody should find excuse in the message of predestination for how you have treated other people and I said Lord give me a word give me something so that at the end of this message I'm giving it away now but so that at the end of this message I can share this so that nobody will walk out of here because I've seen people make big ugly mistakes and then turn around and say well it was for God's purpose as though that excuses them from the wounds that they have inflicted it does not that's not how God operates you need to understand that in Matthew chapter 18 verse 6 in the Amplified it says but whoever causes one of them one of these little ones who believe in and acknowledge and cleave to me to stumble and sin that is who entices him or hinders him in right conduct or thought it would be better more excellent more profitable more advantageous for him that was the last scripture in the notes for him to have a great Millstone fastened around his neck and to be sunk in the depth of the sea even if God wanted to be wounded even if God wanted me broken and God used you to do it that does not justify your deed if you should look around this room and see that through the years there are those sitting here who have wounded you just remember this you have also wounded foreign as I look around this room I see whole people I see godly people I see wonderful people but I don't see any people that are perfect I see a few people who hang on to this martyr syndrome as though they're the only ones that have ever been persecuted the only ones that have ever gone through hardship I've had preachers come and stand in this Pulpit referring to me and say I am not like your pastor who had a Golden Spoon in his mouth the Golden Spoon is quite relevant what looks to you like a Golden Spoon may be a cross on somebody else's back so the truth is all of us have been wounded most likely and all of us have wounded others I'm preaching I can see some of you can't get there but I'm preaching you ever had your feelings hurt guess what you've heard other people's feelings all of it for a reason all of it for a purpose all a part of God's plan but that doesn't let any of us off the hook we owe a repentant we owe it to God to repent of how we were used and we should make it as much as possible Right with one another it's the only way to go forward anybody with me this is butchered lot more butchered than I expected but I need my last 30 minutes sorry I'm taking and I'm claiming it if you need to go the washroom please do if you need to slip out for a moment stretch please do I don't know when I'll be back to preach I may be here Tuesday night I don't know I don't know so let me finish what I'm doing this morning if at all possible the pain from such a harsh treatment could leave you affected the rest of your life however if you refuse uh thankfully excuse me thankfully we have not had to deal with nearly as difficult circumstances as many who have clung to the name of Jesus Through The Years and lost their physical life how many of you can say I'm still living I've been wounded but I'm still living been talked about but I'm still living I've been broken been crucified but I'm still walking I'm still growing how many of you can hold up your hand and say I'm still growing in Christ however if you refuse to deal with your wounds your whole existence may be negatively affected probably leave you lame or even making the end marking the end of your life as a practicing Christian some serve unbelief countless years before they finally come back to God because of the wounding of someone along the way or at least at the very least driving you out of fellowship with other believers leaving you to isolate yourself while nursing your trust issues but it can affect you positively so much so that you re-emerge from your crucifixion by Christians as a new creature as a totally different person does anybody need to recover okay good let me give you the number one step to recovery from being crucified by Brothers and Sisters in Christ you must number one deal with the person who is most responsible for you being crucified I don't blame you if a name came into your mind it's very quiet in here I didn't come to play I don't blame you if a name came to your mind I don't blame you if a church came to your mind I don't blame you if a family member came to your mind but I want to encourage you not to look too deeply into this natural Realm or you'll bog yourself even down deeper in emotions that will never lead to Deliverance but I encourage you rather to look to the Realms of the spiritual not men it's easier to blame people and when we're done blaming people guess what the church likes to do are you listening then the church likes to blame Satan we laugh when we hear the expression the devil made me do it but it's obvious that a lot of people live their life thinking that that's why they are who they are the devil made them do it it's easier to blame one another it's easier to blame the enemy than it is to find the real source who is the one most responsible for those hardships that you have been through perhaps you're going to say you yourself that's not true because most of us would have never chosen the situations that we have found ourselves in I want you to look beyond the names of Earthly men and women and the painful memories of specific instances that you are forced to remember time and time again I want you to find out who is the one who wished This calamity in your life who wanted to see you broken who wanted to see you beat down finally devastated so that you could once and for all die do you know who he was is he really your enemy or is he possibly your friend alone is the one responsible for the crucifixion and persecution of every Christian yet even the wisest and most spiritual are usually in too much pain at the time to correctly identify the one who is most guilty the only way to discover who would do such a thing is to go to the scripture Luke Chapter 22. oh Jesus help us get through these last few minutes Luke 22 verse 39 and he came out and went as he want to the Mount of Olives and his disciples also followed him and when he was at the place he said unto them verse 40 pray that ye enter not into temptation and he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast and he kneeled down and prayed saying father if thou be willing remove his cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done and there appeared an angel unto him from Heaven strengthening him and being in agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling to the ground and when he rose up from prayer and was come to the disciples he found them sleeping for sorrow and said unto them why sleepy rise and pray lest ye enter into temptation how many of you know how that turned out they slept again our Lord was wrestling in the garden it is the very first time since his expression in the earth that the will of the father and the will of the Flesh of the son had been in conflict with one another somebody said how could you say such a thing as a one God preacher because I understand the expression of the word made flesh I understand that my savior was filled with the eternal spirit of his father and yet he lived in a body as a man with a mind with a will with emotions he said clearly if at all possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless how could he pray such a thing he said my spirit is willing I guess it was his Spirit was yielded to the will of the father but he said my flesh is weak there was a Warfare going on there was a conflict going on I want you to know this morning that if Jesus was ever going to fail you if he was ever going to give up on you it would have been that night in the garden of the olive press but I'm here to tell you he won the victory over his own mind will and emotion he won the victory over the weakness of his flesh and he said nevertheless not my will foreign be done it's helpful to remember there's never been but one who crucifies and one who has been crucified when you were broken when you were being broken and crucified at the hands of men and women in reality you were but entering into his crucifixion consider these circumstances who who caused his suffering his Agony his cross in all reality it was the very same one who plotted and planned yours who caused him to be placed on trial who arranged fault with false witnesses to testify against him who chose the men who would break his back causing beat his back causing rivers of blood to flow who selected those soldiers who would drive the nails in his hands and feet who crucified you the same one who is responsible for crucifying your lord if you could ask him ask your lord who crucified you who caused this pain who would have chosen such a harsh and seemingly cruel path of humiliation suffering and ultimately the explosion of your heart in the most awful death that anyone could have death by drowning internally the agony and pain burst his pericardium which caused his heart to enlarge and possibly burst itself sending the the pericardial fluid and the blood that's normally pumped by the heart loose outside of veins and arteries and capillaries loose through the inner cavities of the body so that when that Roman finally put that spear in his side it was water and blood that ran out it was not urine it was the pericardial fluid from the explosion of the heart brother Branham said it was so much more than that he said for like Adam Christ like God reached into Adam and removed his bride that day the Branham said that day at Calvary God reached in to the Christ and removed his wife removed his bride that's powerful that's powerful if you were to ask him if you were to ask your lord if you were to ask Jesus if you were to ask Yeshua the Messiah his answer would come soft and determined it was my father it was the father who wanted his son's crucifixion he even made sure that it would be at the hands of other religious men that day if you refuse to accept your crucifixion your persecution your hardships as coming totally from your father if you continue to accuse and point fingers at your natural brothers and sisters if you continually dwell in the valley of unforgiveness and grudges and vendettas then you were not really crucified you were only mistreated you did not nearly die you are still very much alive if you're still blaming people you are still very much alive if you're still blaming preachers if you're still blaming churches you are still very much alive you were only mistreated you have not yet died and I have the horrible horrible task of telling you your crucifixion has yet to come being mistreated by others is not nearly enough to change us into the image of Christ it's only by a real crucifixion it's only by becoming graveyard dead mistreatment makes us bitter recognizing the father as the source of our crucifixion will make us better we must embrace the truth he arranged every detail the very one who loves you more than anyone else could possibly love you wanted to see you dead your heavenly father your Abba your papa he selected your false Witnesses he selected some two witnesses those who spread rumors and whispered the truth behind your back instead of covering your sin he scripted the words that were hurled at you he knew which of those wounds and those words would crush you and ring in your ears for years to come I know men and women who tell me today I can still hear the voice of my long deceased parents saying you're stupid you'll never amount to anything the circumstances and surroundings of your crucifixion were arranged by your father and he also ordained the results the one who would smash the nails in your wrist and the one that rammed that still felt spear in your side chosen by the one who loves you the most for those who were most involved right on down to the Casual passerby who didn't stop the age you or help you in your trouble or pray for you when you needed to be in prayer prayed for the Lord directed it all the Lord it wasn't the Romans that crucified Jesus it wasn't the Jews that crucified Jesus it was his father before the foundation of the world that chose that death it could have been salvation by drowning but it was salvation by crucifixion the most awful death that anyone could ever die because all the horrors of other deaths are combined in the Roman execution of crucifixion all crucifixions bring rejection pain unfairness rumor and innuendos misunderstanding demeaning belittling loss of reputation loss of friends everybody's crucifixion it hurt everybody it didn't feel good for any of us but you've got to remember in all of this this was your father's plan it was his will for your life because the one who knew you best knew what would be most effective in causing you to turn loose of your own will to live as you wanted to live and live as he had chosen for you to live is anybody with me I feel pretty alone I feel pretty alone this was your father's will for your life after he selected all the players the accusers the crucifier then he chose the victim hand-picked you there's only one conclusion to come to as a True Believer you were being honored by your father he said I will not allow your enemy to destroy you I'll do it myself but I want your flesh dead I want your will dead I want your mind your will and your emotions dead I don't want you to live that old life anymore I want to give you a new life foreign in their right mind would have chosen perhaps the life that they've lived or the circumstances that they've had when we look around we feel like everybody in the whole wide world sometimes has had it better than we have but God knew exactly and it was honor and it was not hate and it was not spiked and maybe you're not there yet foreign but hopefully soon you and I will be able to come to the place where instead of blaming the devil for everything that has happened in our lives because it really just keeps it going or rather than blaming everyone else for what they have put us through maybe soon somebody will be able to say my loving father knew exactly what it was going to take to bring me to the place that I could be fully adopted and exercise the full Authority of the wife of Jesus Christ it was not an act of hate it was an act of love this has not happened to punish you or to watch you suffer as some Twisted entertainment for God this has happened to start a magnificent transformation in your life these hellish events have happened to bring you to exactly the place where your Lord wants you to be this was an act of love the purpose of any destruct crucified where are you who usually help me so much the purpose of any crucifixion is to destroy there are two kinds of Destruction one leads upward and one leads downward did you not at one time pray in your life whatever it takes make me just like you I did then you and I must become a Living Sacrifice who you really are is revealed during a crucifixion there's nothing to hide when you are on the cross you are naked to all of your accusers they see you in your strength and they have seen you in your weakness everything is revealed about you when you're the one on the cross some choose not to be restored but have rather remained forever wounded are you with me a few more minutes I'm very very tired to embrace this crucifixion is to allow the destruction of all that is in you which is not like Christ you don't hear me Lord I want everything that is not like you out of my life then you'd better embrace the stones you better embrace the nails you better embrace the the crown of thorns there was one Hill Three Crosses all three men were crucified each showed a different attitude toward their death one of them stole for a living he had been treated harsh many times maybe the first time he was caught stealing he blamed others but on this day of his crucifixion he made quite a scene he took no responsibility for his actions he blamed God in man he had no remorse he only wanted to escape had he escaped nothing in his life would have changed he would have went right back to his thieving foreign he had a great example hanging next to him on how to be crucified and yet he railed the second Thief you're with me he was also a wicked man blamed everyone else railed from the cross cursed his champion had he been taken down would he have been changed to escape would have been worse for him when you meet him after a while he will tell you I'm glad for the day that I was crucified something changed his attitude what was it he saw love as sister Flo sings he saw the man in the middle he saw an example of how to live now he saw an example of how to die he saw the Lord's reactions he heard his prayer father forgive he even called out to the other Thief and tried to get him to hold his peace he cried remember me folks you make a decision which of those thieves you're going to be today are you going to be the one who blames everybody else for their pain are you going to be one who says remember me when you come into your kingdom remember me because you lived and died I can die and live three men on crosses two when there are thieves one is an innocent man and when it was all said and done an innocent man died to live again one Thief died to never live again and one Thief became a son Jesus died with dignity not even answering those who mocked him how could he have died in such a manner so calm so quiet because of the evening before in Gethsemane he didn't make one social media post to tell the world he was being persecuted he just bowed his head and die surrendered if he would have hung there believing in his heart that Jews killed him he would have railed against his own people had he hung there believing that the Romans were responsible for his death he would have railed against the Romans but instead he knew exactly who had chosen the path that he had agreed to and so he prayed to the one who was responsible father forgive them for they know not what they do he had to learn to yield to his father his Gethsemane was many years before your Gethsemane I told you already of the conflict in the garden of the olive press those other two thieves deserve to be punished for their sins Barabbas deserved to be punished for his sin but Jesus did not Hebrews 5 8 in closing musicians are coming though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered Jesus learned to obey the will of the father by recognizing the source he never complained about his scars he didn't spend the rest of his existence referring back to his crucifixion to his old church to his old friends to his old preachers foreign he just realized my death was necessary I was headed down another road I had to yield my will your father is inviting you to a higher order to a higher life to a higher Realm sometimes it's cancer sometimes it's loss of loved one it's grief sometimes it's miscarriage is painful but this is your invitation to a higher order your loving father wanted you to experience the sting so that you might see the dark side of your own reaction because sometimes we think we're dead when we are very very very much alive let someone mistreat us let someone mishandle us let someone take advantage of us and let's see how dead we are then let our eyes become open to the reality of of what we have yielded ourselves to see then if we are dead or if we are very much alive but I want to tell you Jesus now lives on the other side of Resurrection on the other side of crucifixion so that you and I can live by the power of His Resurrection my last verse second Corinthians 4 17 for our light momentary affliction it's quiet in this church this slight distress of the passing hour is ever I'm reading in the Amplified I'm sorry I forgot to mark it as Amplified for our light momentary Affliction this slight distress of the passing hour is ever more and more abundantly preparing and producing and achieving for us an everlasting weight of Glory beyond all measure excessively surpassing all comparisons and all calculations a vast and Transcendent Glory and blessedness never to cease how is it that our father could choose such a death for us because he saw the other side he saw the resurrection he saw the ascended life it is the truth foreign when I was in North Carolina I told a little story that I've told you before and brother Danny Adams the pastor sent me a few days ago one of the tellings of this story I'm going to read it to you quickly would you stand foreign two young moravians heard of an island in the West Indies were an atheist British owner had somewhere between two thousand and three thousand African slaves and the owner had said no preacher no clergyman will ever stay on this island if his Shipwrecked we'll keep him in a separate house until he has to leave but he's never going to talk to any of us about God I'm through with all that nonsense 3 000 slaves from the jungles of Africa brought to an island in the Atlantic and there to live and die without ever hearing of Christ several thousand black slaves toiled in the sugar cane Fields under the burning Sun three thousand slaves were doomed to live and die without ever hearing of Christ in their 20s from the Moravian sect if you study history you'll find that the moravians were led by a wealthy man who had given his life to Jesus his name was count Von zinsendorf he hosted a prayer meeting that lasted over 100 years two young Germans heard about the plight of these three thousand slaves that were serving a master who refused to allow anyone to tell them about God so they sold themselves to a British planter for the standard price for a male slave the Moravian Community from hernhut came to see the two Lads off who would never return again having freely sold themselves into a lifetime of slavery as a member of the slave Community they would witness as Christians to the love of God family members were emotional they were weeping they were wondering was their extreme sacrifice wise was it necessary the housings had been cast off and were curled up on the pier as the ship Slipped Away with the tide the Gap widened the young man linked arms raised their hands and shouted across the spreading Gap May the lamb that was slain receive the reward for his suffering this became the call of the Moravian Brothers and their missions to the world and this should be our only reason for being if you knew this morning this afternoon that your crucifixion your persecution your hardship was not for hate but for love wouldn't you be able to say if it was so that the lamb could receive the reward for his suffering wouldn't you be able to say it's worth it all to be his child wouldn't you Church if you could realize that it was chosen for you of your father not because he despised you he wanted you to be just like him if you could know that in the end of this life what you have suffered what you have walked through was pulling you into the crucifixion and the death of Christ so that you could also share his resurrection eternal life wouldn't you scream out it's worth it it's worth it it's worth it it's worth it if you find yourself here today still blaming the devil if you find yourself here today still blaming somebody else for your pain if you're not yet willing or have not yet been willing to understand that it was all a part of your father's plan to bring you to his image I invite you today don't leave these grounds until you settle this in your heart until you are able to say father I may not understand it all but like brother Josh Alano around the altar this morning I will say Lord I trust you if you are one who has struggled by pointing the finger at others because you were not yet emotionally ready to comprehend that it was really the one who loved you the most I want you to come and stand and I want you to tell your father Lord I trust you Papa I trust you I may not understand it all but I trust you and may I just say again none of us are getting off foreign words for the stones that we have thrown or the spears that we have hurled at one another we are not getting off it's better for us that a millstone we're tied around our neck and we were drowned in the depths of the sea than to be responsible for hindering one of God's little ones but the truth is that what the enemy meant for evil and he is out for you he wants to so destroy you that you'll never call on God he wants to see you dead for an entirely different reason your father wants to see you die so that he can come and live in your body and manifest who he is let's worship before we pray above all powers above all Kings of all nature and all created things [Music] and all the ways of men [Music] you were here before the world began of all kingdoms of all Thrones of all wonders this world has ever known above all well and Treasures of the Earth [Music] there's no way to measure what you're over [Music] like a rose trampled on the ground you took the fall and you thought of me above all oh [Music] crucified you were laid behind the snow [Music] you live to die rejected trampled on the ground [Music] and you thought of me above all [Music] powers of all Kings above all nature and all creating things above all wisdom and all the ways [Music] [Music] above all Thrones [Music] there's the world has ever known [Music] its Treasures of the Earth [Music] to die rejected [Music] me [Music] crucified [Music] hey rejected [Music] in your thoughts above all the only way that you could hold a grudge against God almighty for the life that you have lived for the things that you have endured is if you don't trust him one of the greatest benefits of seeing this message and the sovereignty of God is it helps us to trust our Papa to know that he is a good good father he will heal you he will restore you he will help you turn loose of your unforgiveness he will deliver you from bitterness he will heal you emotionally he will heal you physically for the effect that it has had on your body and he'll bring you to his resurrection life if you can but trust him and I know some are struggling this morning it's hard sometimes people say it's hard to serve a God the love of God who would not only allow such things seemingly orchestrate them [Music] but we have to trust him he knows he he was [Music] wrote to die rejected [Music] trampled on the ground then you thought of me [Music] crucified you will leave behind the stone you to die I rejected [Music] and you thought of me [Music] to die rejected trampled on the garage [Music] to reach over gently and would you just Minister a little strength I don't want you to go deep it's just not for you to go deep right now but would you just Minister just a little support little strength to somebody near you look around sister Jeffrey I want you to to go here with sister Waller mother Waller just put just Minister a little strength one to another right now let's love one another foreign you can't catch this in the natural you have to catch it by the spirit you have to receive it by a revelation [Music] if it takes you back to the old stuff you're not seeing the revelation so refuse that right now reject it I won't go there the only thing that would take you back is it's easier to blame people don't allow the enemy to do that to you break that off right now say Lord I know you're good it's going to be accomplished in my life I know that every herd and every disappointment and every wound and every betrayal is going to bring me closer to the image of the living Son of God I'm coming out of that place of being crippled don't go deep just let the Holy Spirit do it don't talk if you talk let it be prayer I don't want you to go very deep just show a little strength to the one that's standing there is a if we could Shield one another from the hurt we would do it some need healing around this altar right now I mean physical healing as well let's ask the Lord to do that right now maybe pray in the spirit if he gives you utterance to do so pray in the spirit I don't want this to go in any other direction but what the Lord has ordained it for this moment foreign [Music] [Music] trampled on the ground [Music] above all you were [Music] made behind the snow die checked it in alone like a rose tripled on the garage [Music] behind the stone [Music] to die checked it in the Lord [Music] you thought of me [Music] so sweet to trust in Jesus just to take my his word just to rest upon his promise just to know the same the Lord of Jesus Jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] Jesus [Music] go for Grace to trust him or oh how sweet to trust into [Music] life Jesus [Music] how I trust him [Music] to trust him again [Music] to take him out his way [Music] to rest [Music] [Music] anymore [Music] I know you don't I know some of you don't understand and you were trying to move in in D in deep work with with one another that's not where we are today that's not what this service is about you need to be very mindful of what I'm trying to tell you this is not an hour to look to the problem to the memory to the perpetrator to the ones involved no no look above [Music] I'm not saying I'm not saying that some of us don't need to walk through that at some point that's not this hour this is for you to shift every bit of your focus under the one who loves you so much and be able to tell him from the depth of your being I trust you I love you and I know that you are working all things for my good it breaks my heart to know that I have caused such pain it breaks my heart to know that I have crucified other Christians with my words with my attitudes with my poor leadership through the years I will stand in no way Justified I have repented and repent again it doesn't give me any Joy any pleasure any validation to know that God has used it I'm thankful I'm thankful that he has we want to be a people that can love him and trust him and fellowship his suffering obey his voice without any more crucifixions without any more beatings Whom The Father loves he chastens if he chastens you not you're illegitimate you're none of his I love him more his breaking has not caused me to love him last it's caused me to love him more we can't sing it but the trio used to sing a song written by a Jesus name preacher whose son and daughter-in-law are either daughter and son-in-law I don't remember were killed in a terrible car accident with some a couple of children I think in and an unborn baby all died and he sat down and wrote the words to the song the trio used to sing I still trust you I've seen the righteous forsaken it seems the wicked seemed to go free but I still trust you let me see if I I messed up the words let me see if I can find it and read it just a little of it to you while you're here somebody find it for Me Maybe I can't hardly stew so sweet [Music] I've got it thank you I've seen the righteous man suffer pain and it looked like the wicked would go free and in my frustration it just didn't seem right to me I ask you for Sunshine but you sent a rain I cried for healing but I only got pain but I know your love will see me through Lord I still trust you I still Trust You Lord I still Trust You Lord that you're able to guide me through this dry Barren land and when I don't know which way to turn or go I still Trust You Lord let me hold to your hand I trust you this is my my favorite verse I trust you because you've been so faithful to me and you said in your word I'll never leave nor forsake thee low I'll go with you under the end your blood is cleansed me from all guilt and sin your promise I can hold on to Lord I love trusting you when we can come to that place than in our lives
