[38:22] I'll pour my love
[38:26] on
[38:28] you.
[38:29] If praise is like perfume,
[38:34] I lavish mine on you
[38:38] till every drop is gone.
[38:43] I'll pour my love
[38:47] on
[38:50] you.
[38:55] Oh, I just want to say I love you, Lord.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; I love you, Lord.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; I love you.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful, wonderful Savior.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; Glorious,
[39:14] &gt;&gt; glorious God.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:20] Hallelujah.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[39:28] [Music]
[39:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:32] As we approach the throne of grace,
[39:37] &gt;&gt; we come boldly bringing our petitions to
[39:40] him.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; Do you have a need that you just want to
[39:43] lift your hand in the air?
[39:46] Say, "I have a need." Out across the
[39:49] stream,
[39:51] as you join us in this service, and
[39:53] you've probably lifted your hand, the
[39:57] Lord sees the need that you have, and he
[39:59] knows how to meet that need.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Continue to remember brother Bobby
[40:05] Wartz.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; And his family to the Lord that God
[40:08] would move on their behalf. And this may
[40:12] sound a little odd to request prayer for
[40:14] somebody like this, but uh we saw the
[40:18] Hoppers last night and the mom and dad
[40:21] aren't able to travel anymore. And I'm
[40:23] only mentioning it because Claude and
[40:26] brother Bobby are very close friends.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; Oh wow.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; And so I I was able to speak to Dean
[40:31] last night and both his mom and his dad
[40:34] are very ill. They're both sick, very
[40:36] ill, and need a touch from the Lord. And
[40:39] as we were sharing our friendship with
[40:41] Bobby, he mentioned that and let's let's
[40:45] just remember them. You know, we we I I
[40:49] can appreciate anybody that has lifted
[40:51] up the name of Jesus.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; And I appreciate that. So, let's go to
[40:54] God in prayer on their behalf.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Claude and Connie Hopper.
[41:02] Let's remember our nation today.
[41:06] Many executives gathering in the west
[41:09] are asking God's protection upon that
[41:11] gathering between 70 and 100,000 people.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; The stadium only holds 60,000.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; But they're saying there could be
[41:21] between 70 and 100,000 people. That's
[41:24] &gt;&gt; a lot of people.
[41:31] [Music]
[41:35] Thou
[41:37] art worthy.
[41:41] Thou
[41:43] art worthy.
[41:47] Thou
[41:49] art worthy,
[41:52] oh Lord,
[41:58] to
[42:00] receive glory.
[42:04] Glory
[42:06] and honor.
[42:10] Gloryy
[42:12] and honor
[42:15] and power.

[42:30] created.
[42:33] Thou hast
[42:36] created
[42:38] all things
[42:41] [Applause]
[42:45] and for thy pleasure
[42:50] [Music]

[42:56] thou
[42:58] art worthy.
[43:02] Brother RJ, will you come and pray
[43:04] today, please?
[43:06] Oh yes, thou
[43:09] art worthy.
[43:13] Thou
[43:14] art worthy.
[43:18] Thou
[43:20] art worthy,
[43:23] oh Lord,
[43:26] [Music]
[43:29] to
[43:31] receive glory.
[43:35] Gloryy
[43:37] and honor,
[43:40] gloryy
[43:42] and honor.
[43:45] and pray.
[43:51] For thou hast

[43:56] hast all things
[43:59] created.
[44:03] Thou hast
[44:05] created
[44:08] all things.
[44:14] And for
[44:16] thy pleasure
[44:19] they are
[44:22] creat.
[44:23] [Music]
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Oh thank you father.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Yes yes yes.
[44:42] We thank you for the revelation, Lord,
[44:44] that you overcame.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; And when you entered into those heavens
[44:51] with your blood, Lord, you sat down,
[44:56] because your work was finished.
[45:00] And we thank you, oh God,
[45:03] that seated in that heavenly realm. You
[45:06] poured out your spirit upon men
[45:11] as an earnest,
[45:13] as a down payment for the house that you
[45:17] desire to occupy.
[45:20] And we're living in an hour, oh God,
[45:22] that we believe that the earnest is
[45:25] going to become fullness.
[45:29] And we rejoice in that today.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; No matter how dark it looks, oh God,
[45:36] there is light that shines forth upon
[45:39] your people.
[45:42] And so we position ourselves before you
[45:44] today, Aba. Again,
[45:48] as participants,
[45:51] hungry for your purposes to be outworked
[45:54] in our lives.
[45:56] I pray again in my life, oh God, in this
[46:00] body that a a a new cleansing will come,
[46:05] &gt;&gt; that your fire will fall, oh God, that
[46:08] we would be vessels prepared for your
[46:12] glory, for your honor, oh God, that we
[46:15] can be used for your purposes.
[46:19] Lord, we speak healing over every body
[46:22] represented. Every name Bobby WZ,
[46:29] &gt;&gt; Lord, you paid the price.
[46:32] Regardless of how it looks in the
[46:35] natural, Father, over every situation,
[46:39] we confess atonement. We confess
[46:42] redemption. We confess healing and
[46:46] deliverance in the name of Yeshua the
[46:48] Messiah. Lord, let it come out of this
[46:51] place today. Let testimonies be heard.
[46:55] Let lives be changed.
[46:58] Lord, we we pray for this meeting in
[47:01] Arizona today. If if anything else,
[47:04] Father, I thank you that Jesus is being
[47:07] exalted, that your name is being made
[47:10] known. And many people have said it,
[47:13] Lord. It was it was Saul that rejoiced
[47:17] in the stoning of Steven
[47:19] &gt;&gt; and he became one of your greatest
[47:21] assets in your purposes in the early
[47:24] church. And we pray that Sauls would be
[47:27] converted into Paul's today as that ears
[47:31] would be open to hear your word and that
[47:34] lives would be changed. Oh God, let it
[47:37] be so. In the name of Yeshua, the
[47:41] Messiah.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; And we rejoice in you again, Lord. None
[47:47] of this would be possible without you.
[47:50] That's right.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; Without your love, Lord, that that moved
[47:54] you to come and live and die and shed
[47:58] your blood. And so we thank you today
[48:01] for your goodness. We rejoice in your
[48:04] healing, oh God. We rejoice in your
[48:07] provision. and we lay claim, oh God, to
[48:11] every promise of the inheritance that
[48:13] you've given to us.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; Let it not slip through our fingers, oh
[48:18] God. But may your people today apprehend
[48:22] that which you're offering us in the
[48:25] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Lord,
[48:28] have your will today. Give us eyes to
[48:31] see and ears to hear. And Lord, may your
[48:34] spirit just feel welcome in this place.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; May you be exalted. May you be lifted
[48:41] high.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; May you rejoice in the praises of your
[48:46] people.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; In the name of Yeshua, the Messiah we
[48:49] pray. Amen.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; We praise you, Lord.
[48:56] We praise you, Lord.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:01] [Applause]
[49:05] Oh, there is power, power, wonder
[49:09] working power in the blood
[49:13] of the lamb.
[49:16] There is power, power, wonderworking
[49:20] power in the precious blood of the lamb.
[49:25] Yes, there is power, power, wonder
[49:29] working power in the blood
[49:33] of the lamb.
[49:35] There is power, power, wonder working
[49:39] power in the precious.
[49:42] Sing one more time. Oh, there is power,
[49:46] power, wonder working power in the blood
[49:52] of the lamb.
[49:54] There is power, power, wonder working
[49:58] power in the precious blood of the lamb.
[50:04] Yes, in the precious blood of the lamb.
[50:13] Oh, praise to the lamb.
[50:16] We praise you, Lord.
[50:19] [Music]
[50:20] Praise the Lord.
[50:24] You may have your seats today. We are
[50:27] blessed to be in the house of the Lord.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; We're blessed to know what we know.
[50:33] We're blessed to know who we know.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Because of him, we live and move and
[50:38] have our being. Everything that we are
[50:41] is because of him and his goodness in
[50:43] our life.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; We're glad that you're here.
[50:49] Brother Donovan, Sister Audrey, we are
[50:53] so happy to see you today in the house
[50:56] of the Lord.
[51:02] We've been enjoying the blessing of
[51:04] Nikesha and Nia, but to see you today,
[51:06] it's such a blessing.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; So thankful that the Lord gave you
[51:10] strength, Sister Audrey, that you could
[51:12] be here with us today.
[51:15] My sister Doris is here for some time. I
[51:18] don't know how long a time 10, 12, 14
[51:21] days to help with the children as the
[51:26] birth of the twins are coming close.
[51:28] We're thankful that she is here. We
[51:31] bless her in the name of the Lord.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; We're just
[51:37] [Applause]
[51:39] we're glad that God is on the throne,
[51:41] &gt;&gt; that he knows all about us. He knows our
[51:44] needs. He knows our petition. He knows
[51:47] our ups and our downs.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; He knows when to use gentle parenting
[51:53] and he knows when to get out the rod.
[51:57] I was reading in the book of Hosea this
[51:59] morning and I just was was I was amazed
[52:03] to see the Lord saying, you know, I
[52:05] tried being real loving and tried to
[52:08] take the bridal off real gently,
[52:12] &gt;&gt; gentle parenting.
[52:15] But he said that didn't work so well.
[52:18] Had to get a little more aggressive. But
[52:20] I'm glad he knows what I need. Amen.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; He knows how to get me where I need to
[52:26] be.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; He knows to what to do so that I can be
[52:31] all that he created me to be.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; And I don't want to be one of those, as
[52:36] we have been hearing lately, that has
[52:38] buried my talent under the dirt.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; I want to rise up to accomplish what God
[52:44] has called me to do in this end time
[52:46] hour. And I pray that you are the same
[52:50] way. So, we've come today to to worship
[52:55] the Lord, to hear the word one more
[52:57] time, to let it change us from the
[53:00] inside out. We're letting it change us
[53:03] from glory to glory. He's changing us.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; And I'm thankful that he is doing it.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Cade's going to he's going to
[53:12] sing again today. We're going to worship
[53:14] together as we're preparing uh a little
[53:17] more our hearts to for the hearing of
[53:19] the word. We're going to receive the
[53:21] tithe and offering as he is worshiping
[53:24] and we're worshiping with him. We're
[53:27] going to worship with our voice. We're
[53:29] going to worship with our posture. We're
[53:30] going to worship with our giving to the
[53:32] Lord in tithe and in offering. Brother
[53:35] Austin, would you come? Brother Ellas,
[53:37] will you come? Let you go to the people
[53:39] today to give as giving unto the Lord.
[53:42] Aren't you glad that the Lord provides
[53:43] everything that you have need of? He is
[53:46] good all the time. He is the faithful
[53:49] provider and we bless him for it.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; That's the truth. He is
[53:58] [Music]
[54:12] over the mountains and the sea. Your
[54:15] river runs with love for me. And I will
[54:20] open up my heart and let the healer set
[54:24] me free. I'm happy to be in the truth.
[54:29] And I will daily lift my hand. And I
[54:33] will always sing of when your love came
[54:37] down.

[55:10] [Music]
[55:16] the mountains and the seas, your river
[55:19] runs with love for me. And I will open
[55:24] up my heart and let the evil set me
[55:28] free. I'm happy to be in the truth. And
[55:33] I will daily lift my hands. And I will
[55:38] always sing of when your love came down.
[55:44] I could sing of your love
[55:48] forever.
[55:51] Lord, I could sing of your love
[55:55] forever.

[56:02] forever.

[1:04:56] a tad because it works so much better
[1:04:59] when I take it off of mute.
[1:05:03] Isn't that amazing?
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; At least I can't get mad at anybody for
[1:05:08] muting me. I'm muted myself.
[1:05:11] God is faithful in all of his ways.
[1:05:14] I'm glad to be in the house of the Lord
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; today. He's wonderful and worthy to be
[1:05:19] praised. Hallelujah. I feel his
[1:05:22] presence.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; I know he's here. I know he's up to
[1:05:25] something, and I want to be a part of it
[1:05:27] today. I really do. Uh I wanted to
[1:05:30] mention, I didn't mention earlier, but I
[1:05:32] wanted to mention, I failed to mention
[1:05:34] in the prayer request to ask you to
[1:05:38] please help me pray for brother Adam
[1:05:39] Knight and his wife, Sister Ida.
[1:05:43] I had invited brother Adam to come and
[1:05:46] speak uh at least one night of camp
[1:05:48] meeting and he is going to be unable to
[1:05:50] come. Uh he is not well. He has had I
[1:05:55] don't remember how many surgeries. Do
[1:05:58] you remember how many Benjamin
[1:06:01] for for a hernia that he keeps pulling
[1:06:04] in the pull pit pulling in the pull pit?
[1:06:07] And uh the doctor finally told him, he
[1:06:10] said, "It's getting very serious." And
[1:06:12] and he said, "You you're going to have
[1:06:13] to stop preaching."
[1:06:15] And and and well, he just said, "I
[1:06:18] couldn't never do that. I'd rather be
[1:06:20] dead than than not be able to preach."
[1:06:23] And he said, "Well, maybe you could just
[1:06:25] calm down a little, you know, just hold
[1:06:27] back a little." He said, "Well, like I
[1:06:29] said, I'd rather be dead than that, you
[1:06:31] know." And when he sings, he sings with
[1:06:33] every I mean, you can feel it coming out
[1:06:35] of his toes. if any of you were with him
[1:06:38] with us when we were in North Carolina.
[1:06:40] He's preached to her a couple times
[1:06:41] during camp meeting, but it's been a
[1:06:43] long time. And uh I'm disappointed that
[1:06:46] he would not be able to come, but also
[1:06:48] sister Ida's mother is getting very low
[1:06:50] and may be crossing soon. And they were
[1:06:53] there uh this week and just lift them up
[1:06:56] to the Lord. He's a a fellow laborer in
[1:07:00] the faith and uh has a marvelous balance
[1:07:03] in all these things that are so
[1:07:04] important to have a balance in. And so
[1:07:07] I'd like for you to pray for him. Today
[1:07:09] is Sister Jennifer Wart's birthday. I
[1:07:12] don't have any idea that they would be
[1:07:14] streaming today or maybe they would see
[1:07:16] this in archive but uh if they did can
[1:07:19] we just say uh to sister Jennifer how
[1:07:22] much we love you dear sister and wish
[1:07:25] you a happy happy birthday and we are
[1:07:28] all praying for you every day we're
[1:07:30] praying for brother Bobby and she is a
[1:07:33] part of him
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; I try to call her name before the Lord
[1:07:37] when I'm praying but even if I didn't
[1:07:39] she's a part of him so if I'm praying
[1:07:41] for him. I'm praying for her as well. Uh
[1:07:44] tomorrow, excuse me, Wednesday is Sister
[1:07:46] Rona's birthday in South Africa and we
[1:07:49] want to send her love and happy birthday
[1:07:51] greetings. Uh they have a desire to be
[1:07:54] here with us and uh the arrangements
[1:07:56] have not been coming together. I
[1:07:58] understand from some of you, they've not
[1:08:00] been coming together just right yet for
[1:08:02] for all that's needed. But uh here's how
[1:08:05] I look about all things like that. We
[1:08:08] can try to make something happen. And uh
[1:08:11] if it's God's will, good, you know.
[1:08:13] Hallelujah. But if it's not his will, I
[1:08:16] don't want to pull somebody out of the
[1:08:19] perfect plan of God.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Did you know something can be God's will
[1:08:23] but not his timing?
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; And and so we want to pray for them. I
[1:08:28] do believe that sometimes I have been
[1:08:30] guilty in years past of uh of having
[1:08:35] such a desire, believing that something
[1:08:37] was the perfect plan of God and working
[1:08:40] a little too hard to make it happen and
[1:08:42] and then not get the same results as you
[1:08:45] could have gotten if it was the perfect
[1:08:47] plan. Uh I have people challenge me
[1:08:50] quite often on perfect and permissive
[1:08:53] will, but it's in the message. Brother
[1:08:55] Brandham preached it many times and it's
[1:08:57] in the scripture and uh it doesn't mean
[1:09:00] that you won't be successful. It it just
[1:09:02] simply means you won't have the very
[1:09:04] full benefit.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Uh and I want the full if I'm going to
[1:09:07] labor for the kingdom, I want the full
[1:09:09] benefit.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; Not just for myself, but for those I
[1:09:13] minister to.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; And so uh bless them. And if it be God's
[1:09:18] will, well, we'll see you shortly. That
[1:09:20] is for sure. Sister Cindy, how many
[1:09:23] years now? This is is this the second
[1:09:25] second anniversary wedding anniversary
[1:09:27] you will have without brother Anthony.
[1:09:30] So this Thursday and and you know that
[1:09:32] that's fresh. That's still fresh. And so
[1:09:35] let's uh uh celebrate the love that they
[1:09:38] shared together. And uh uh you know the
[1:09:43] truth is Anthony was an amazing fellow.
[1:09:46] I know a lot of you didn't didn't know
[1:09:47] him and I didn't know him as well in the
[1:09:50] last years but he was an amazing guy.
[1:09:53] But it wasn't easy.
[1:09:55] And my mother wasn't easy. And if my
[1:09:58] mother said somebody wasn't easy,
[1:10:01] she was an expert.
[1:10:04] I don't know if she ever called him
[1:10:05] Brother Anthony. I doubt she ever did. I
[1:10:08] don't even know she ever called him
[1:10:10] Anthony unless she was mad. But she
[1:10:12] always called him rotten.
[1:10:16] And that was what she called her dog
[1:10:18] that she loved very much.
[1:10:21] And so they had a very good relationship
[1:10:25] and uh he had a dry sense of humor, but
[1:10:28] it was it was uh plentiful. And I know I
[1:10:32] know that he got the woman, the lady
[1:10:36] that God had for him. I'm sure of that
[1:10:40] because she certainly took very very
[1:10:42] good care of him. And I know that her
[1:10:44] heart still breaks. So, we're going to
[1:10:47] pray for her and uh this week especially
[1:10:51] and u I know God will bring her through.
[1:10:53] Uh April has a birthday on Friday. Is
[1:10:57] that it is right Friday. Let's say happy
[1:11:00] birthday to sister April. I don't
[1:11:04] I didn't even look up how many
[1:11:07] it's just a number, right? What does it
[1:11:09] matter? Brother Charles Gillard is a
[1:11:12] streamer, faithful streamer with his
[1:11:14] parents and I saw that his birthday was
[1:11:16] Friday and I want to wish him a very
[1:11:19] happy birthday as well. Uh there's just
[1:11:22] a lot of things going on that we we just
[1:11:24] want to be where God wants us to be at
[1:11:27] the time that he wants us to be there.
[1:11:30] Would you make sure that I announce that
[1:11:31] at the end of the service? Would you
[1:11:33] remind me and and and and uh we'll do it
[1:11:36] then.
[1:11:37] Sister Rebecca reached out this morning
[1:11:39] and she said she'd been listening to
[1:11:41] Fill My Cup, Lord. And she wanted us to
[1:11:43] sing it this morning. Let's do that. Um,
[1:11:47] let's sing that as we get ready again
[1:11:48] for the word. We just keep getting ready
[1:11:50] for the word. We've said that more than
[1:11:53] once, but let's do this because this has
[1:11:56] been on our If you're able, you can
[1:11:58] stand. If you don't feel able, you're
[1:12:00] going to be sitting a while though. Uh
[1:12:04] fill my cup
[1:12:07] Lord.
[1:12:09] I lift it up Lord.
[1:12:16] Come and quench
[1:12:20] this thirsting
[1:12:22] of my soul.
[1:12:29] Bread of heaven,
[1:12:33] come and feed me till I want no more.
[1:12:42] Fill my cup,
[1:12:45] fill it up,
[1:12:48] and make me whole.
[1:12:52] Sing it just like that again. Fill my
[1:12:56] cup,
[1:12:58] Lord.
[1:13:00] I lift it up,
[1:13:05] Lord. That's why we're here. Oh, we need
[1:13:09] something.
[1:13:11] Come and quench this thirsting
[1:13:15] of my soul.
[1:13:21] Bread
[1:13:22] of heaven.
[1:13:25] Oh, come and feed us.
[1:13:28] Feed us till we won't no more.
[1:13:34] Fill my cup.
[1:13:37] Fill it up
[1:13:40] and make me whole.
[1:13:45] Oh,
[1:13:48] there are millions
[1:13:51] in this world
[1:13:54] who are craving.
[1:13:57] [Music]
[1:13:59] I believe that the pleasures
[1:14:04] [Music]
[1:14:06] earthly things
[1:14:08] afford.
[1:14:13] Oh, but none
[1:14:17] none can match the one
[1:14:22] treasure
[1:14:23] [Music]
[1:14:26] that I find
[1:14:31] in Jesus Christ my Lord.
[1:14:38] Sing it to him again. Fill my cup,
[1:14:43] Lord.
[1:14:45] I lift it up. Lord,
[1:14:53] come. Come and quench,
[1:14:57] quench this thirsting of my soul.
[1:15:05] Bread
[1:15:07] of heaven. Oh mana, come and feed me.
[1:15:12] Feed me till I won't. I won't no more.
[1:15:19] Fill my cup. Fill it up
[1:15:25] and make me whole.
[1:15:29] Let's sing about that little woman
[1:15:31] before we go to the word.
[1:15:34] Like the woman at the well,
[1:15:38] I
[1:15:40] was seeking
[1:15:46] for things
[1:15:49] that could not satisfy.
[1:15:56] Oh, hallelujah. Oh, but then then I
[1:16:03] heard my savior
[1:16:07] speaking.
[1:16:10] Draw
[1:16:11] draw from my well.
[1:16:15] Oh that never shall
[1:16:19] run dry.
[1:16:24] Fill my cup,
[1:16:28] Lord. We just wave our cups before you
[1:16:30] today. Oh, we lift them up, Lord.
[1:16:35] Oh, you're so faithful to fill them.
[1:16:37] Come and quench,
[1:16:41] quench this thirsting
[1:16:44] of my soul.
[1:16:50] Bread,
[1:16:51] bread of heaven.
[1:16:54] Come and feed me, feed me till I want,
[1:17:00] till I want no more. Fill my cup, fill
[1:17:08] it up, and make me whole.
[1:17:17] Here's my cup,
[1:17:20] Lord.
[1:17:22] I lift it up.
[1:17:27] Lord
[1:17:28] Jesus, come
[1:17:31] as only you can
[1:17:34] quench this thirsting
[1:17:37] of my soul.
[1:17:41] [Music]
[1:17:44] Bread of heaven.
[1:17:47] Feed me. Feed me. Feed me till I won't
[1:17:54] till I want no more. Fill my cup.
[1:18:00] Fill it up
[1:18:03] and make me
[1:18:06] whole.
[1:18:10] That's what happens when he feeds us.
[1:18:13] He takes our brokenness
[1:18:16] and he makes us whole. Why don't you
[1:18:18] praise him for that right now?
[1:18:22] I'm sorry.
[1:18:26] Woo.
[1:18:29] While you're clapping, clap for these
[1:18:33] wonderful musicians.
[1:18:36] My my,
[1:18:39] how blessed we are. Yes.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Turn in your Bible this morning to Psalm
[1:18:43] 98.
[1:18:45] I want to read verses 1-9.
[1:18:49] Psalm 98:es
[1:18:51] 1-9.
[1:18:53] As the sun goes down tomorrow evening,
[1:18:57] the chauffear blasts around the world,
[1:19:01] ushering in the beginning of the fall
[1:19:04] feast of the Lord. I know that some
[1:19:07] people refer to them as Jewish feast,
[1:19:10] but the Bible refers to them as the
[1:19:12] feast of Yahweh
[1:19:14] or sometimes we could say the feast of
[1:19:17] Jehovah. Brother Brandham used the word
[1:19:19] Jehovah, but he told us more than once
[1:19:22] that word is incorrect. He knew that it
[1:19:25] wasn't an accurate translation, but it
[1:19:28] was the English translation and he spoke
[1:19:31] English. But we look at his feast
[1:19:35] knowing they don't exclusively belong to
[1:19:37] the Jewish people. If they did, the
[1:19:40] bride would be pretty bored in eternity
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; because the scripture tells us that
[1:19:47] these feasts are going to be
[1:19:50] memorialized and remembered even in the
[1:19:53] millennium
[1:19:55] and in the new heaven and the new earth.
[1:19:58] Now I tell you, if God feels so strongly
[1:20:01] about their marking of time that he
[1:20:05] would let something ordained in time
[1:20:08] carry over to eternity, there is a
[1:20:11] message there.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; There's a there is an importance there.
[1:20:16] There are a couple laws uh quickly I
[1:20:18] know you're standing but it's only nine
[1:20:20] verses. There are couple laws that are
[1:20:22] applied to Bible study or Bible
[1:20:25] interpretation. There there many but two
[1:20:28] of the first laws that are applied.
[1:20:32] Number one is the law of first
[1:20:34] mentioned.
[1:20:36] You can learn a lot about a subject by
[1:20:39] going to where that is first mentioned
[1:20:43] in the Bible and and if it's in the Old
[1:20:47] Testament then you will learn a lot by
[1:20:49] looking at the original language.
[1:20:51] Brother Brandham used the Daglot. The
[1:20:54] daglot is more limited than the lexicon,
[1:20:57] but you can certainly use either one of
[1:20:59] those tools. That doesn't make you
[1:21:00] intellectual.
[1:21:02] It doesn't make you philosophical.
[1:21:06] It doesn't mean that you like
[1:21:07] psychology.
[1:21:08] It simply means you want to understand
[1:21:10] the meaning of the word.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham told us so many
[1:21:16] times, I have no education. And so he
[1:21:18] said, I can be wrong on these things.
[1:21:21] and he told us where to go to make sure
[1:21:23] that what we were getting was was right
[1:21:25] and was correct. And the other law is
[1:21:29] looking at how many times something is
[1:21:32] mentioned in the Bible. Now all the
[1:21:34] scriptures important
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; everything co he said cover to cover
[1:21:40] to cover. It's important. It's there for
[1:21:42] a reason. It's not a mistake that we
[1:21:45] have it. But we learn a lot about a
[1:21:48] subject by seeing how many times it's
[1:21:50] mentioned in the Bible.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; And so it's the law of first mention and
[1:21:55] the law of mention that we start
[1:21:58] applying when we're looking at any
[1:21:59] subject in the Bible. And when we look
[1:22:01] at the feast of the Lord, they go all
[1:22:03] the way across. Jesus is talking about
[1:22:06] them. John the Revelator in the book of
[1:22:08] the Revelation is talking about them.
[1:22:11] And so there's something to learn about
[1:22:13] them. Some of them speak directly to the
[1:22:16] bride even in the last days. And we want
[1:22:19] to uh take a moment to reflect on that
[1:22:22] from time to time. The uh I want to read
[1:22:26] Psalm 98:es 1-9. Oh, sing unto the Lord
[1:22:30] what?
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; A new song. He must not be offended by
[1:22:34] singing something that is uh written
[1:22:37] after 65.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; For he hath done
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; marvelous thing. I want you to say it
[1:22:44] again. Marvelous.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Marvelous.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; You know, that's a marvelous word.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; We don't use it enough. It's big. It's
[1:22:51] bigger than big. He's done marvelous
[1:22:55] things. Can anybody testify that he has
[1:22:58] done marvelous things
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; in your life? Praise God. His right
[1:23:04] hand,
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; which is power and authority,
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; and his holy arm
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; hath gotten him
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; the victory.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; I want you to say, Jesus is the victor.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; He's not the victory. He is the victor.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Who is the victory? You are.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Because you are connected to the victor.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; He's the one who won the victory.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's how he got the
[1:23:34] victory. He became the victor. And you
[1:23:37] are that victory. You are the lamb's
[1:23:39] reward.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; You are the seed that he saw
[1:23:44] prophetically before the foundation of
[1:23:46] the world. We know that. That's what the
[1:23:48] scripture tells us. Sing unto the Lord a
[1:23:50] new song, for he hath done marvelous
[1:23:51] things. His right hand and his holy arm
[1:23:54] hath gotten him the victory. I love it.
[1:23:58] The Lord hath made known his Yeshua.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; That's the word.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; The Lord hath made known his salvation,
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; which is the word Yeshua in Hebrew. His
[1:24:13] righteousness hath he openly showed in
[1:24:17] the sight.
[1:24:20] Amen.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; He delights in showing his majesty and
[1:24:25] marvelous works even in the face of
[1:24:27] darkness.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's God's sovereign.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Somebody say sovereign and supreme.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; He is.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; And he loves to show himself mighty even
[1:24:38] in the sight of the heathen. Verse
[1:24:41] three, he hath remembered his mercy and
[1:24:43] his truth toward the house of Israel.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; All the ends of the earth have seen the
[1:24:53] salvation, the Yeshua of our God. Make a
[1:24:58] joyful peep,
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; a sacred hush,
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; whisper.
[1:25:09] Make a joyful noise.
[1:25:12] [Music]
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; Tua
[1:25:17] sir.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Tua.
[1:25:19] It it's it's the blast of a chauffear.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; It's the blast of a voice.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; In one of the scriptures. In fact, it's
[1:25:29] this it's in this psalm that the word is
[1:25:33] used as a noun and as a verb. And one
[1:25:37] time it's used referring to the to the
[1:25:39] blast of the hollowed horn
[1:25:44] uh of a of the ram. Now this didn't come
[1:25:47] from a ram. I have one maybe in the
[1:25:51] studio that came from a ram, but it's
[1:25:54] talking about this. Now it's naturally
[1:25:58] hollow, but but it gets uh uh it is what
[1:26:02] it is. It's like fingernails. It's the
[1:26:05] same kind of uh I I can't remember. Is
[1:26:10] it keratin or something like that? Am I
[1:26:12] getting it right? Keratin. Uh the body
[1:26:15] produces it and for you it makes
[1:26:18] fingernails. I I'm I'm glad it does. For
[1:26:22] the for the animal, it makes a horn like
[1:26:25] this. And by putting a little hole in
[1:26:28] the end of it, they can blast it. So,
[1:26:30] one time in in this psalm, it's talking
[1:26:33] about the sound of this thing and and in
[1:26:36] the other reference, it's talking about
[1:26:38] the blast of a voice, the shout, the
[1:26:43] sound of a human voice.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; And God looks at both the sound of the
[1:26:50] chauffear and the sound that comes out
[1:26:52] of his redeemed as the same. It
[1:26:56] accomplishes the same thing in the
[1:26:59] earth.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; It pleases the Lord.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; It pleases the Lord. How many of you
[1:27:04] want to please him?
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; I want to please him.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; So, he tells us what pleases him. Make a
[1:27:11] joyful noise
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; unto the Lord. All the earth,
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; make a noise.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; I don't need to say anything about it
[1:27:22] cuz some of you got it down path. and
[1:27:25] rejoice
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; and and do what again? Sing.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Sing praise.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Ah, too much singing. Too much singing.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; You better read the Psalms.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; He loves to hear singing.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; He loves to hear you singing.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; And it's not based on whether or not you
[1:27:45] can carry a tune in a bucket.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; We can all sing in the shower. It's unto
[1:27:50] the Lord. Amen. Sing praise. Sing
[1:27:53] praise. Praise God. Sing praise.
[1:27:58] All right, let's go on. Sing unto the
[1:28:00] Lord again with a harp.
[1:28:04] With a harp and the voice of a psalm,
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; which is a spiritual song and it can be
[1:28:13] spontaneous.
[1:28:14] It can be inspired in the moment with
[1:28:18] trumpets. Let me show you.
[1:28:21] Not every time,
[1:28:23] not every time in the Bible does the
[1:28:25] word trumpets in English mean this.
[1:28:29] There are multiple times in the Bible
[1:28:32] where the word in English is trumpets
[1:28:34] and it's referring to this.
[1:28:40] So you won't know which it's referring
[1:28:43] to. Why do you need to know? Because
[1:28:45] they mean two different things. Yes.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; See, if you're understanding the
[1:28:51] fullness of something, you're going to
[1:28:52] want to know which one it's talking
[1:28:53] about.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; In fact, there's at least one time it's
[1:28:56] talking about voice, human voice,
[1:28:59] translated as trumpet. So, you're going
[1:29:01] to want to know, is that the voice of
[1:29:03] the bride?
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Is that the the wind, the sound that
[1:29:07] comes out of a of a trumpet like this,
[1:29:09] or is it the sound that comes out of a
[1:29:12] trumpet like this, which is a chauffar?
[1:29:15] I I am one of those inquiring minds
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; and I want to know.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; With trumpets and sound of cornet.
[1:29:26] Somebody say cornet.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; That is not an a musical instrument
[1:29:33] uh in the in the band.
[1:29:36] There is an instrument that they have
[1:29:38] come to call that. That's not what this
[1:29:40] is talking about. That word here cornet
[1:29:43] is chauffar.
[1:29:45] When we hear the word chauffar, what are
[1:29:47] we talking about? Are we talking about
[1:29:49] the silver thing here or we talk about
[1:29:52] this? We're talking about this. So, this
[1:29:54] is a cornet
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; with trumpets
[1:29:58] and sound of cornet. Make a joyful noise
[1:30:03] before the Lord the King.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Why are you doing this? God bless you.
[1:30:09] You may be seated. May he add blessing
[1:30:11] to the reading of his word. No need for
[1:30:12] you to stand just because I have to
[1:30:14] stand. Why are you doing this? Because I
[1:30:17] want to show you
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; what he's referring to when the psalmist
[1:30:22] under inspiration is writing these
[1:30:24] words. So you you may watch this and and
[1:30:28] you may it may bother you.
[1:30:32] It may vex you
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; if somebody has one of these
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; or somebody has one of these. But I want
[1:30:38] you to know it doesn't vex,
[1:30:41] perturb, or bother the Lord.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; He said, "With trumpets and sound of
[1:30:48] chauffar, make a joyful noise before the
[1:30:54] Lord the King."
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Now, you know what makes these uh
[1:30:59] man-made instruments
[1:31:01] and animalade instruments? Do you know
[1:31:04] what makes them sound?
[1:31:07] There's no read in this.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; It's just a hollow hole. I can't blow it
[1:31:14] because my teeth are too big. My front
[1:31:15] teeth are too big. And I can't make that
[1:31:18] buzz that you have to make to blow a
[1:31:21] trumpet. Like brother Gley can blow a
[1:31:23] real trumpet. He has a trumpet. He can
[1:31:24] blow a real trumpet. It's This is a
[1:31:27] little harder to blow probably than your
[1:31:28] trumpet because it has no read, no
[1:31:31] mouthpiece. This has at least a
[1:31:33] mouthpiece, but no no read, I don't
[1:31:36] think. And uh but this won't do anything
[1:31:42] without what?
[1:31:45] Breath.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; I I mean, you might hook it up to a uh
[1:31:50] to an air compressor,
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; but I don't think you're going to get
[1:31:54] the right sound.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; It's not just air. Come on. It's
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; not just oxygen.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; It's It's living breath.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you what the word what the
[1:32:08] words mean. Vibrating
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; living
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; breath.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Uh
[1:32:20] he
[1:32:22] breathed
[1:32:25] living breath.
[1:32:28] Ruach,
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; oh my
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; vibrating breath
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; into Adam, Adam.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; And Adam became, which means red earth,
[1:32:37] by the way, red clay. So Adam was made
[1:32:41] from from the dirt
[1:32:45] in uh Eden.
[1:32:48] And in Eden, there was a garden. And we
[1:32:51] sometimes call it the garden of Eden.
[1:32:53] And Adam was made from red dirt. Which
[1:32:56] means that the dirt in Eden was pretty
[1:32:59] similar to the dirt in Alabama.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Red dirt.
[1:33:04] Adam was made of red dirt. And all he
[1:33:07] was was a dirt man,
[1:33:10] a dust man. Until God Almighty, I know
[1:33:14] you know this, but I can't get past it.
[1:33:17] God Almighty
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; who had no physical form.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; He was only representing himself at that
[1:33:26] time uh as as something like light, a
[1:33:29] fountain of light,
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; truth, holiness, you know, love
[1:33:34] projected
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; but not in the physical body of a man.
[1:33:39] God Almighty, the eternal spirit of the
[1:33:42] father came down mouthto mouth.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Right. Yes, sir.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; And breathed breath into the nostrils
[1:33:51] of Adam,
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; spirit breath,
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; vibrating breath, living breath, not air
[1:33:58] compressor breath.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; That's air. What you put in your tire is
[1:34:04] not breath.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; It's air.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; There, don't get confused. It's not air
[1:34:09] that made you a living soul.
[1:34:12] It's not air that connected your spirit
[1:34:15] man with your flesh body and therefore
[1:34:18] connected you to your environment. No,
[1:34:20] no, no. It was vibrating breath
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; of almighty God.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; And he and remember what Jesus what we
[1:34:31] learned about Jesus in the New
[1:34:33] Testament. And Jesus breathed on them
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; and said,
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; "Receive ye
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; the ruach hakodesh.
[1:34:46] The Holy Ghost.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Receive the Holy Ghost, but the Holy
[1:34:51] Ghost had not yet been given. It was not
[1:34:54] yet the day of Pentecost."
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; And yet Jesus had in him breath.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; There you go. He breathed on them
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; and they were filled with the Holy
[1:35:05] Ghost.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; So the Holy Ghost is not a separate
[1:35:09] person.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost was breath, spirit, life
[1:35:14] that was inside of son. S O N
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; because he had the ability to then
[1:35:21] impart the Holy Ghost with his breath.
[1:35:26] Just like he breathed on Adam, just like
[1:35:28] he breathed on 120.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; He came in the form of a of pillars of
[1:35:36] fire and a mighty rushing ruach.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; A mighty rushing wind. But it wasn't air
[1:35:44] only.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; The wind that blew on the day of
[1:35:48] Pentecost. Oh my. I don't know why this
[1:35:52] simple simple uh message is is exciting
[1:35:56] me so the wind that blew at Pentecost
[1:36:00] wasn't just air.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; It was something more. It was spirit
[1:36:06] life.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was the same breath that
[1:36:10] God breathed into Adam
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; and that Jesus breathed into those who
[1:36:16] he was ministering to in that moment.
[1:36:20] breathed on them and they received the
[1:36:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Be careful what you criticize.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; I I mean really we we shouldn't
[1:36:32] criticize
[1:36:33] because that's how that life was
[1:36:35] released.
[1:36:37] Now it takes more than air to make this
[1:36:40] thing work and it takes more than air to
[1:36:42] make this instrument work. It takes
[1:36:45] breath. Living vibrating breath, not
[1:36:49] air. breath.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; That's what makes this sound. That's
[1:36:53] what makes this sound. And that's what
[1:36:55] makes you sound.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Because you and I are instruments unto
[1:36:59] the Lord.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; And we don't have much to say in the
[1:37:03] last day. We really don't have much to
[1:37:05] say of our own accord.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; We really desire to know the mind of the
[1:37:10] spirit.
[1:37:12] Uh the prophet told us that in those
[1:37:14] last days the bride would have
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; thus saith the Lord.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Now I don't think thus sayaith the Lord
[1:37:23] should be a punctuation on every
[1:37:26] interpretation of tongues or on every
[1:37:29] inspired gifted exhortation.
[1:37:33] You can if you know it. If you know that
[1:37:36] you know that you know that you know.
[1:37:38] But once you roll something off of you
[1:37:41] and you roll it entirely on the Lord, it
[1:37:45] better be.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; It better be. Thus sayeth the Lord. Yes,
[1:37:51] sir.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Because you're taking it out. You're
[1:37:53] saying, I have no influence in this.
[1:37:56] This is not me,
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; This is not my thoughts.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Say with me a minute.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; This isn't what I think or what I know
[1:38:04] about the situation. He's just using my
[1:38:06] voice. So when you say thus saith the
[1:38:10] Lord,
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; you if you're punctuating, Brother
[1:38:12] Brandham warns us and be careful about
[1:38:14] using that. Don't don't throw that
[1:38:16] around like it's an amen
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; or a filler in some kind of word from,
[1:38:21] you know, exhortation or something. But
[1:38:23] if you say it, let it be
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; punctuation
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; in the sense that you're saying this is
[1:38:30] not of me. I know
[1:38:33] that he has come and took charge
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; and the inspiration comes. This is thus
[1:38:38] sayith the Lord. He said in that last
[1:38:41] day the bride will have thus sayaith the
[1:38:42] Lord or she will do what?
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; She'll keep still.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; She has nothing to say and nothing to
[1:38:49] do. Jesus had nothing to say and nothing
[1:38:51] to do. He said except it be shown of me
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; of the eternal spirit of my father.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the prophet taught us that he
[1:39:00] moved by vision.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Jesus ministered many times by vision.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Not just by sunship or by being the word
[1:39:12] manifest.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; He moved many times in ministry by
[1:39:17] vision.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; And you and I have been called to carry
[1:39:21] on.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; The ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; in the earth. Is that right? Yes.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; That doesn't make you Jesus.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; It makes you Mrs. Jesus Christ.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; I'm good with that.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Anybody follow?
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; I'm good with that.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Married to the word.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Married to him.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; And without some uncction, she's going
[1:39:46] to say little and do little. But when
[1:39:49] that uncction comes and she knows who's
[1:39:52] she is and who it is that has taken
[1:39:55] control, he will be able to speak
[1:39:58] through her. He said as the final voice
[1:40:02] of God to the agemen,
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; the bride.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; The bride.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; The bride.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; The bride.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; She won't be hot air.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; She won't just be a bunch of hot air.
[1:40:15] She's got to have the breath, the
[1:40:17] vibrating life, the breath, the spirit
[1:40:20] breath, the spirit life.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; In New Testament numa
[1:40:27] in in Old Testament ruach,
[1:40:30] it's more than wind, more than air. It's
[1:40:34] vibrating living substance because it's
[1:40:38] spirit breath, spirit life.
[1:40:42] Did you know you can get around somebody
[1:40:43] who's been drinking on that?
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; And you feel lively?
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Have you ever been charged by being
[1:40:51] around somebody who's been charged?
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; That's right. The atmosphere changes.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; We're sitting in a room with hundreds of
[1:41:02] Baptist people last night and most of
[1:41:05] them old, precious people. Quite a few
[1:41:08] of them had blue hair. I'm trying to
[1:41:10] figure out where that comes along. Blue
[1:41:13] hair.
[1:41:14] Uh all kinds of uh you know dudes.
[1:41:17] They're done up. These old people are so
[1:41:19] done up. I think Lord, they must have
[1:41:20] started at 9:00 this morning to be that
[1:41:23] fixed up to get here tonight. Every now
[1:41:26] and then, you know, you hear a little
[1:41:27] little something. I cannot help myself.
[1:41:30] I don't want to embarrass myself. I
[1:41:32] don't want to embarrass my family.
[1:41:34] But but I can't help it. I just can't
[1:41:36] help myself. When I get blessed, I'm
[1:41:39] blessed.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; And so you go out and everybody in
[1:41:43] there's nodding. Pentecostal, aren't
[1:41:44] you? You're Pentecostal, aren't you? You
[1:41:46] go Pentecost.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; They didn't act like they hated it. They
[1:41:50] ought to have been thanking us.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; The singers thanked us.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Because they appreciate. You've got some
[1:41:57] pull. Amen. Amen.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; If you're full of the vibrating life,
[1:42:02] the breath of almighty God, the spirit
[1:42:04] of life, if you've got him in you,
[1:42:07] you've got some pull
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; on the anointing
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; for the musician,
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; for the singer,
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; for the worshipper, for the preacher,
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; and you ought to use it.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; We ought to use it with trumpets and
[1:42:25] sound of coronet. make a joyful again
[1:42:29] noise
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; before the Lord
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; the melik the king he's melik haha holam
[1:42:37] the king of the whole universe
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; amen let the sea roar
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; and the fullness thereof the world and
[1:42:46] they that dwell therein let them roar
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; don't only let the sea roar but let let
[1:42:52] those who dwell in the land roar
[1:42:56] Why? Because it's not your oxygen. It's
[1:42:59] not your carbon dioxide. It's not your
[1:43:01] whatever, however all that work. It's
[1:43:03] not your air.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; When you when you roar your praises unto
[1:43:07] God, you're releasing something. Oh,
[1:43:11] I've seen it.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; You're releasing something like Jesus
[1:43:15] was when he breathed on them. Get under
[1:43:17] the word. Get under the word. Get under
[1:43:19] the word. Get under the word as much as
[1:43:22] you can as often as you can. And when
[1:43:24] you can hear it in the prophet's voice,
[1:43:26] do it.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; It's a special blessing
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; to hear it. It's a special blessing to
[1:43:35] hear it because you know that you're not
[1:43:38] hearing somebody's education.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; You're hearing something divine,
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; something from the Lord. Hear it. Let
[1:43:47] the floods clap their hands.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; Let the hills
[1:43:55] The hills
[1:43:57] be joyful
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; together before the Lord, for he cometh
[1:44:04] to judge the earth. Can you imagine that
[1:44:06] all creation is praising him, clapping
[1:44:09] its hands, roaring unto him because he's
[1:44:12] coming to judge the earth.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; That's that's because creation knows who
[1:44:18] she is. She knows she knows she's there
[1:44:20] to serve his pleasure. She's not worried
[1:44:23] about judgment.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; She knows why she exists. Creation
[1:44:27] exists
[1:44:29] to the pleasure. For the pleasure of the
[1:44:32] creator
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; of the Lord. He said, "For he cometh to
[1:44:36] judge the earth with righteousness
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; shall he judge the world and the people
[1:44:41] with
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; with equity, with justice, with a
[1:44:45] righteous balance."
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; With justice.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; With justice. You don't. It's a very
[1:44:51] similar word in the original language.
[1:44:53] Judgment and justice.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Judgment has more of a negative
[1:44:57] connotation often because we feel like
[1:45:00] it means that that a sentence is going
[1:45:01] to be uh handed out. But if you look at
[1:45:04] the book of Daniel, it's okay for a
[1:45:06] sentence to be handed out
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; because he's going to issue a judgment.
[1:45:11] Daniel said
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; it's a just and and and it is equity.
[1:45:16] It's justice and equity. But he's going
[1:45:18] to issue a judgment on behalf.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; I got it, but I'll never get to it.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; Of the saints.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; I'm going to render a righteous judgment
[1:45:31] on behalf of the saints.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, he's done that for you
[1:45:35] more than once. Yes, sir.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; When all hell had charged you
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; and had placed you and I both before the
[1:45:45] courtroom of the king
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; rightfully so.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Not wrongfully charged, rightfully
[1:45:51] charged. Guilty of everything the devil
[1:45:54] said.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; You did. Yeah. Yeah, I did. You You did.
[1:45:58] Yeah, I did. I did. I did. And I want
[1:46:00] you to know in that moment it could have
[1:46:03] been death. In that moment, it could
[1:46:06] have been destruction.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; In that moment, it could have been uh
[1:46:11] leaving you as a pile of dust, but he
[1:46:13] rendered on your behalf a righteous
[1:46:15] judgment. He could do that because you
[1:46:18] were covered by the blood
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; of an innocent lamb.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; You weren't just saved. Is anybody hear
[1:46:25] me?
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; You weren't just saved.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; You were redeemed.
[1:46:31] [Applause]
[1:46:33] And because of your redemption, it
[1:46:36] covered
[1:46:38] what you had done
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; it covered what you were doing
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; when you got called up to the court
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; and it covered anything that you might
[1:46:51] ever do
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; as an infraction
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; of his righteous instruction.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; You see, redemption doesn't just cover
[1:47:00] us from the behind. It covers us all
[1:47:03] around.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; It's the present. It's the past. It's
[1:47:07] the future.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; God has a way of bringing us back to his
[1:47:12] original thoughts about us in the
[1:47:14] beginning. How can he do it? Because of
[1:47:17] grace. Because of the blood.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Because of his righteousness.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; He said, "I want to dress you
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; in my righteousness."
[1:47:30] Hallelujah.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; When Zachchariah was caught up into the
[1:47:35] heavenly realms in Zechariah chapter 3
[1:47:39] and he saw Joshua, Yahushua, the the
[1:47:42] high priest clothed in filthy garments,
[1:47:46] the the residue and the remnants of the
[1:47:50] captivity in Babylon.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; He was a high priest. He was ordained of
[1:47:55] God. He had done what he was called to
[1:47:58] do. But his robe and his turban had
[1:48:01] become stained by the residue and the
[1:48:04] remnant of the captivity.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; You were captive.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; I was captive.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; We come way over here and sometimes we
[1:48:15] find out that we're still stay right
[1:48:16] here, please. We're carrying some kind
[1:48:19] of remnant, some kind of piggyback
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; like a cockleber or something gets on us
[1:48:25] and we carry it around
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; and and we've got to be made clean.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; And there was no condemnation from him
[1:48:31] who sat on the throne.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Get that filthy man out
[1:48:35] of my sight."
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; He said, "Come
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; and change his clothes."
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; Somebody bring him a festal robe.
[1:48:47] The word there is festal robe. It means
[1:48:50] the royal apparel. Bring him the royal
[1:48:53] apparel.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; The the the the dress of feast.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; Festival. That's what it means.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; What you would wear to a banquet,
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; to a feast.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; Sorry.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Bring him those festal robes and clothe
[1:49:12] him and get him a fair miter.
[1:49:17] a clean turban for his head.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Because the holiness is smudged.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; It covers it comes with a band. Holiness
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; unto the Lord.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; His holiness has been smudged by the
[1:49:35] residue of Babylonian captivity.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:49:44] Give him a new one.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; Put hole in his back.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; In that uh in that um what do we call
[1:49:56] the armor? God's armor. Uh ar uh help
[1:50:00] me. In the New Testament, the armor of
[1:50:02] the Lord.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Uh the feet are I'm not saying it just
[1:50:07] right, am I?
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Say it again. Yeah, I know. What What do
[1:50:11] you Is it What do we call
[1:50:13] The whole armor of God. I'm sorry. I
[1:50:16] needed it. King James. Whole armor of
[1:50:18] God. I couldn't I couldn't I armored in
[1:50:21] armor of God. Armor of God. Whole whol
[1:50:24] armor of God. Complete
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; armor of God. Head to toe.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; Feet shaw with the preparation of peace.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; Come on. Dressed up all the way down.
[1:50:34] Don't don't mind the fact that it's
[1:50:36] patterned after the Roman armor and and
[1:50:39] not the armor of the Hebrews. Don't
[1:50:40] don't worry about that. It doesn't
[1:50:41] matter. Doesn't matter. It's our armor.
[1:50:43] God gave it to us and we ought to wear
[1:50:45] it.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; According to the Old Testament, somebody
[1:50:48] said, "Notice though in the New
[1:50:50] Testament, there's nothing for your
[1:50:52] back." Well, that there's I tell you
[1:50:54] what we'll say about that. We'll say,
[1:50:55] "Then you better not turn your back to
[1:50:57] the devil."
[1:50:59] But if you ever do,
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; the Old Testament has you covered
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; because he said, "The glory
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; of the Lord,
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; the cavode of the Lord shall be your
[1:51:11] rear word."
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Your rear word.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; And no, that word is not re-reward.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; It's rearward.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; It means bringing up from behind. The
[1:51:24] glory of the Lord will cover you. the
[1:51:27] breastplate of righteousness, sword of
[1:51:30] the spirit. Woo!
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Helmet of salvation.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; But here the Lord said, uh, the word,
[1:51:38] him who sat as judge said, now put that
[1:51:41] fair miter on his head. And we know what
[1:51:43] that was. Holiness unto the Lord. You,
[1:51:46] you get a little smudged
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; because you're you get a little residue
[1:51:51] of what you've been through.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; Been through some stuff. If anybody's
[1:51:55] been through some stuff, hold up your
[1:51:57] hand.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; Anybody been through some stuff?
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; Anybody been through some stuff this
[1:52:02] week?
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; I guess the rest of you are comeos.
[1:52:09] No wonder we didn't see you nowhere. You
[1:52:11] were hibernated somewhere like a bear.
[1:52:14] If you got out, you don't have to get
[1:52:15] out. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; Stuff will find you.
[1:52:21] You can't hide from from swirl, I call
[1:52:24] it.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; You can't hide from swirl.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; There's always something swirling in the
[1:52:30] atmosphere.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; Because you're bi- dimensional.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; You are bi- dimensional. You're triune
[1:52:40] as a man, but you're bi- dimensional.
[1:52:42] You're living in two realms at one time.
[1:52:44] Amen.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; You're living in a spirit realm, a
[1:52:49] heavenly realm, an an atmosphere of
[1:52:51] eternity realm,
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; and you're living in an earthly natural
[1:52:55] flesh realm.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; And and uh if you have a if you have an
[1:52:59] office uh uh uh in the five-fold
[1:53:02] ministry, then even that can be
[1:53:04] magnified.
[1:53:06] So if you think it's difficult as just
[1:53:08] maybe a believer and and I don't when I
[1:53:10] say just I don't mean that it's measured
[1:53:13] and one's higher than the other. But but
[1:53:15] I mean as a believer you you learn a
[1:53:19] little about what that means to live in
[1:53:21] two dimensions at one time spiritually.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Now we know that according to the law of
[1:53:27] physics we're living in three dimensions
[1:53:31] at one time. But we add something when
[1:53:34] we're looking at the spirit. We're bi-
[1:53:36] dimensional, meaning of this earth and
[1:53:39] earthy as Adam was both earthy
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; and otherworldly. Yes, sir.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; By the spirit. Amen. You are too.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Adam would have never had a soul.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; He would have never had a soul had not
[1:53:53] spirit connected with earth.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; When earth connects with spirit, spirit
[1:53:58] connects with earth. It takes a soul in
[1:54:00] the middle
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; to connect you
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; because your your your your your
[1:54:08] body, your flesh body and your spirit
[1:54:10] man is going to be in conflict all the
[1:54:12] time. And that's why God puts in the
[1:54:15] middle there the senses. That's to
[1:54:17] connect the outward atmosphere through
[1:54:19] the flesh. But he puts those senses of
[1:54:22] the inner man.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; Mine my car. Brother Green used to say
[1:54:28] memories,
[1:54:31] imaginations, conscience, affections,
[1:54:34] reasonings, those are part of the middle
[1:54:36] earth, the middle part of a man. And
[1:54:39] that's how your spirit can connect your
[1:54:41] flesh. Your flesh can connect to your
[1:54:42] spirit. We might say emotionally,
[1:54:46] you'd be miserable. You'd be miserable
[1:54:49] to live half in heaven and half in earth
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; if something didn't help you navigate in
[1:54:54] that middle ground. I may that may not
[1:54:56] be of interest to anybody else but it
[1:54:58] has many many many times balanced me out
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; when I cried like a little girl and I
[1:55:06] couldn't control my tears
[1:55:09] and I didn't know why. I didn't
[1:55:10] understand it and it was that inner it
[1:55:13] was that inner balance. It's God is a
[1:55:16] gift. It's it's to be sanctified and
[1:55:18] controlled by Holy Ghost.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; But it's a gift to you. If you didn't
[1:55:24] have that realm of emotion, if you
[1:55:26] didn't have that realm uh of of memory,
[1:55:30] imagination, conscious affections, and
[1:55:32] reasonings, if you didn't have that
[1:55:34] realm, you'd be more miserable than you
[1:55:37] already are trying to navigate this god
[1:55:39] life in a godless society.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; But you've got to have you've got to
[1:55:44] have exercise authority over though.
[1:55:46] You've got to exercise authority over
[1:55:48] your imagination. You've got to exercise
[1:55:50] authority over your conscience. You've
[1:55:52] got to Somebody said, "I thought the
[1:55:54] conscience was there to guide." The
[1:55:55] problem is the enemy wants to sear that
[1:55:57] thing with a hot iron.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; So, you can't trust a conscience that's
[1:56:02] been seared.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; You've got to let the spirit of God
[1:56:05] bring life back to that awakening
[1:56:07] awakening that part of who you are so
[1:56:09] that you have a moral compass
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; because even though everybody else is
[1:56:14] doing it, hand though, hand join in
[1:56:16] hand, the wicked will not go unpunished.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; You can't follow the crowd. If you
[1:56:21] follow the crowd, you'll follow them
[1:56:22] right to eternal separation from God.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; You've got to follow the word if it
[1:56:27] feels good. If it don't feel good,
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; if you like it, if you don't like it,
[1:56:32] you got to follow the word.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, I'm a Methodist."
[1:56:36] I don't care what you are. You've got to
[1:56:38] follow the word.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; It's here for us.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; Let the flood before the Lord. Oh,
[1:56:46] there's so much. Just just
[1:56:49] Psalm 98:6 in the complete Jewish Bible.
[1:56:53] Uh I like the way it work because it
[1:56:56] gives us the word chauffar there. It
[1:56:57] says with trumpets and the sound of the
[1:56:59] chauffear. I didn't know what a cornet
[1:57:02] was, but I knew what a chauffar was.
[1:57:04] With trumpets and the sound of the
[1:57:05] chauffar, shout for joy before the king.
[1:57:10] Adoni,
[1:57:12] Lord.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; Adoni.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord.
[1:57:17] Lord. Have you ever thought about what
[1:57:19] that means to call him Adoni? To call
[1:57:22] him Lord.
[1:57:24] It's like it's like the declaration
[1:57:26] after the resurrection.
[1:57:29] Raboni.
[1:57:31] She said, "Raboni,
[1:57:33] Master,
[1:57:35] Lord."
[1:57:37] Daddy Rambo wrote the song.
[1:57:40] But the angels called him Jesus,
[1:57:44] born of a virgin.
[1:57:47] Mary called him Jesus, but I call him
[1:57:52] Lord,
[1:57:54] Master
[1:57:56] Adonai. The church has emphasized the
[1:58:00] friendship of God and we need to know
[1:58:02] that we are joints with Christ and we
[1:58:05] are friends
[1:58:07] with him. He said so
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; he loves us in that in that brotherly
[1:58:14] affection sort of fraternal affection
[1:58:16] sort of way as well.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; But he's more than a friend.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; That stickketh closer than a brother.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; He's more than that. He's lord. He's
[1:58:28] master.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; He's boss man.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine that? He's boss man and
[1:58:34] lover.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; Boss man and lover
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; at the same time. He who my soul longeth
[1:58:46] after.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; The psalmist said, "As the h a r t as
[1:58:52] the little deer panteth."
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; Running through the w excuse me, I'll
[1:59:01] get it in a minute. Running through the
[1:59:03] woods,
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; out of breath.
[1:59:08] You see a dog in the summertime not even
[1:59:12] running and that tongue hanging out and
[1:59:15] it's panty,
[1:59:17] you think it's dying. No, it's living.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; That's a sign that its body is adapting
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; to what's going on.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; It's a sign that it needs to cool off.
[1:59:29] Come on.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; And that little deer's been running
[1:59:32] through the woods and he comes down and
[1:59:34] he sees that beautiful
[1:59:37] cool
[1:59:39] spring.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; That little cool creek fed by an
[1:59:45] artisian spring that never runs out.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; It's got something on the inside.
[1:59:52] Brother Ram said just pushing.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; You ever had one? You ever been to one?
[1:59:58] I've told you before, I've been to an
[2:00:00] artisian spring down between Phoenix
[2:00:04] City and Eupfalla. I'd like to know if
[2:00:07] it's still there.
[2:00:10] A pipe coming out of the hill and people
[2:00:14] standing there when I was a boy with 150
[2:00:17] uh empty milk jugs
[2:00:20] to put them under that that pipe that
[2:00:23] someone had put in there to catch that
[2:00:26] artisian water. Oh my. It's probably
[2:00:29] because I'm 57 years old and it's been
[2:00:34] 40 something years since I had a drink.
[2:00:36] It It's probably making it sweeter and
[2:00:39] more wonderful than it really was.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; Absence can make the heart grow fonder
[2:00:44] and it can make the hyperbole grow
[2:00:46] larger.
[2:00:49] But if I remember right, it was the best
[2:00:52] water I'd ever tasted in my life.
[2:00:56] It it didn't have time to get filled up
[2:00:58] with sediment. It didn't get time to get
[2:01:00] filled up with anything but natural
[2:01:01] minerals because it was always running.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; I tell you, you've got a well. You get
[2:01:06] the Holy Ghost. You get the Holy Ghost.
[2:01:08] You better get the Holy Ghost because
[2:01:10] when you get the Holy Ghost inside of
[2:01:12] you, he is an artisian well.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; He never stops giving out. He just
[2:01:19] pumping pumping pumping pumping out. And
[2:01:22] it's not air. And it's not oxygen.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; It's vibrating
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; breath,
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; vibrating life
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; that come from the original life,
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; the creator.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, let me just tell this story. This is
[2:01:38] not in the note.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; But uh
[2:01:43] little deer, brother Bram said, you see
[2:01:45] a little deer come down and drink.
[2:01:47] Little bird play around in the shallow
[2:01:49] waters
[2:01:51] peeping around. You've seen them
[2:01:53] bathing. Have you ever I told you I'm
[2:01:56] old cuz now I watch the thing. I watch
[2:01:59] nature which we never had time for when
[2:02:02] we were young. Now we make time. I'm
[2:02:06] late for the offering. I don't have a
[2:02:08] time to get here. And when I'm late, I
[2:02:09] usually stay late to make up for it as
[2:02:12] though I have an invisible clock to
[2:02:14] clock in. But I'm sometime I'm sometimes
[2:02:17] a little later getting over here because
[2:02:18] I'm standing in the bay window watching
[2:02:20] the deer. or watching the bird or
[2:02:23] watching something. Brother Brandham
[2:02:25] liked to do it. He was not not old but
[2:02:27] getting that way. He said and he he
[2:02:30] said, "I wonder if that spring could
[2:02:32] talk. I wonder what what would is always
[2:02:34] bubbling." He said just happy happy
[2:02:38] just bubbling. I wonder what it would
[2:02:40] say.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; If it could talk said if I could ask it,
[2:02:44] why are you so happy you little spring,
[2:02:46] you little little creek? Why? Why are
[2:02:48] you so happy bubbling all the time? Is
[2:02:50] it because the deer come and find a cool
[2:02:53] refreshment and satisfaction in your
[2:02:55] water? Said if that little spring could
[2:02:57] talk, it'd say, "No, that's not what it
[2:02:59] is." Is it because the little birds come
[2:03:01] and splash around? You know, they get
[2:03:04] water on their feathers and shake it off
[2:03:06] and the oil of their feathers sheds that
[2:03:09] water and they feel clean. Did you know
[2:03:11] a bird will take a dirt bath sometimes?
[2:03:13] Certain birds will take a dirt bath and
[2:03:15] they feel cleaner once they do that than
[2:03:17] they did before because of that natural
[2:03:19] oil that's on their on their feathers.
[2:03:22] You see, is it because the little birds
[2:03:24] are are, you know, flopping around in
[2:03:27] your little shallow water there? Is that
[2:03:28] if if you is that what makes you happy?
[2:03:30] Oh, no. He said that wouldn't be what it
[2:03:33] was. Then if that little spring could
[2:03:35] talk, he said we What is it? He He said,
[2:03:37] "Well, there if it could talk, he'd say
[2:03:40] there's something down on the inside
[2:03:44] of me that I it just keeps bubbling out.
[2:03:48] It just keeps coming out. And that's
[2:03:50] where
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; that's where my joy comes from. And
[2:03:56] that's where my life comes from, my
[2:03:59] peace
[2:04:01] comes from that.
[2:04:03] My get up and go. My press on
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; the zeal of the Lord. It comes from
[2:04:12] something on the inside.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; It's not a pull from without.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; It's a pull from within.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, the vibrating life. You will know
[2:04:24] you. Somebody say, "I don't like that
[2:04:25] word vibration." I I think the new age
[2:04:27] uses that word. I don't care.
[2:04:30] I don't care what words they hijack
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; and use
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; just like these religious purists who
[2:04:41] who don't want a musical instrument
[2:04:44] in a church because it wasn't mentioned
[2:04:47] in the New Testament. So,
[2:04:50] uh I didn't read anywhere where grace
[2:04:54] kicked out the guitar.
[2:04:59] The Old Testament's full of these
[2:05:01] instruments.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; In the New Testament, the emphasis is
[2:05:04] not on this instrument. It's on this
[2:05:08] instrument.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; But that doesn't mean that we don't use
[2:05:11] this instrument because as we said a
[2:05:13] moment ago, that doesn't do. You can I
[2:05:15] don't care what the guitar I don't care
[2:05:17] what brand it is.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; I don't care if it's the Ched Atkins
[2:05:21] model.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; Do you know who that is, Josh?
[2:05:25] Uh, it can't do nothing
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; over there in the corner on the stand.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; If somebody don't pick it up and use it
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; and somebody might pick it up and use it
[2:05:36] to glorify drunk.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; Riotus, debauchery living.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; And then you'd say that's an instrument
[2:05:44] of the devil.
[2:05:47] The
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; devil's using that whooping people up
[2:05:49] into their drunken frenzy, getting them
[2:05:51] all excited.
[2:05:53] But if a man of God goes over there and
[2:05:55] picks up that guitar and begins to play
[2:05:58] under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost,
[2:06:02] sir,
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; then that's not an instrument of the
[2:06:04] devil anymore.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; Because an instrument of God has picked
[2:06:08] up an instrument
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; and is using that unto the glory of God.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't want no drums in my
[2:06:15] church. Then you ought to be somewhere
[2:06:17] else
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; cuz you'll never get them out of here.
[2:06:22] That's right.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; We're going to concrete them to the
[2:06:25] ground.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; And the reason why is because people
[2:06:29] can't clap.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; They can't keep the re the rhythm, the
[2:06:38] beat.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; And so you have something to set them.
[2:06:43] Just like brother Bam said, you won't
[2:06:44] have revival. Well, I said they get him
[2:06:46] a drum
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; and beat on it.
[2:06:50] He's talking about the Salvation Army
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; down on the street corner. Boom, boom,
[2:06:54] boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Draw
[2:06:56] drawing the attention of the people
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; for the word to go forth.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; You don't take these kinds of things and
[2:07:04] say just exclusively there of the enemy
[2:07:06] because Elvis Presley had it or because
[2:07:09] some other uh you know uh
[2:07:16] Lucy liked candy bars.
[2:07:19] But that don't mean that candy bars are
[2:07:22] wrong because Lucy Lucille s what do you
[2:07:25] call Susie? He liked to call her Susie.
[2:07:28] Her name was Lucy. He liked to call her
[2:07:30] Susie because she liked chocolate bars.
[2:07:33] And and and and he didn't particularly
[2:07:35] care for what kind of thing she was
[2:07:38] advertising and portraying in the world.
[2:07:40] Thank God he can't see. Thank God I pray
[2:07:43] he doesn't know what they pump on that
[2:07:46] crazy television in these days. Right.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; A man smacking a man on the lips.
[2:07:52] [Music]
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; I bet I Love Lucy and her pedal pushers
[2:07:56] doesn't look so bad now.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; When you see how those things just keep
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; magnifying and magnifying and
[2:08:05] magnifying, but because she liked the
[2:08:07] candy bar doesn't mean all candy bars
[2:08:09] are of the devil. I'm here to tell you
[2:08:11] that all candy bars are not of the
[2:08:12] devil.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; You've got to have a balancing thing.
[2:08:16] Use what you have to the glory of God.
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Use your clap hands if you
[2:08:22] don't even if you don't clap on time.
[2:08:24] Just clap a little softer if you don't
[2:08:25] know how to keep the rhythm
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; so you don't throw somebody else off.
[2:08:29] But clap clap clap. Use what you got
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; to glorify the Lord.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; All right. Uh so so then in uh Psalm
[2:08:38] 89:15, let's go there quickly. I got to
[2:08:41] hurry. It's 105. Blessed is the people.
[2:08:48] Blessed is I didn't know Sister Annie
[2:08:50] was here. I didn't see you, Sister
[2:08:52] Annie, till I heard you. You've got a
[2:08:54] very distinct
[2:08:57] very distinct. God bless you for your
[2:09:01] I like it. Blessed is the people that
[2:09:05] know
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; the joyful sound.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; Terua.
[2:09:16] Somebody say terua.
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; It's the feast of trumpets. Terua.
[2:09:25] The word sound here joyful sound. Sound
[2:09:30] is terua.
[2:09:33] And here's what it means. Shout, blast,
[2:09:36] alarm of war. Alarm, war cry.
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; I wonder if pacifists in the natural
[2:09:46] will make very good warriors in the
[2:09:49] spirit.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; I'm not sure. But I pray so because
[2:09:54] we're in an hour now
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; where it wouldn't pay to be passive
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; in the spirit
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; because hell is marching hounds of hell
[2:10:08] and onslaught of darkness,
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; wicked. That's it.
[2:10:13] constantly, constantly howling,
[2:10:16] constantly barking, constantly waring
[2:10:20] against the saints.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; 10 thousands of ten thousands of demon
[2:10:25] spirits lid, ripped off, loosed,
[2:10:30] not on
[2:10:32] the institutional church,
[2:10:35] &gt;&gt; the bride.
[2:10:38] Go ahead.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; But that you got to be here if they're
[2:10:40] loosed on you. So it has to be before
[2:10:43] rapture
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; if you're going to apply that
[2:10:47] understanding that brother Brandham had.
[2:10:49] Then no wonder you fight
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; because those spirits are honed in
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; on you. Yes, sir.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; They can't change who you are. They
[2:11:02] can't change your election. They can't
[2:11:04] change your prefix destiny. They But
[2:11:06] what they'll do is they will harass you
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; until they cause you to let go of the
[2:11:11] very thing
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; that gives you life.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; Don't let go.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; Don't let go.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, don't let go. Abide in
[2:11:23] the vine.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; Don't let go of the vine. The vine is
[2:11:26] the life support.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; The vine is the life source. Don't let
[2:11:30] go of the vine. No matter what the enemy
[2:11:33] says. You can get mad at the preacher,
[2:11:35] but don't get mad at the vine. Don't get
[2:11:37] mad at Jesus. Don't get mad at the word.
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; That's life to us.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; That's all the enemy can do. He'll lie.
[2:11:46] He'll bring you to court. He'll make you
[2:11:48] think you're going to have to face it
[2:11:49] all on your own.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; And then you then you, you know, then
[2:11:54] you start thinking of the song. Then
[2:11:56] mercy walks in. Sure enough,
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; it's real. That that song is is
[2:12:03] certainly allegory in some sense of the
[2:12:06] word and in other senses of the word,
[2:12:08] it's extremely real
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; because the accuser does stand in the
[2:12:11] courtroom
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; accusing you and and oh, where is your
[2:12:16] God now?
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; Where is your Jesus now?
[2:12:22] And you're this and you're that and you
[2:12:24] did and you did and you did that and you
[2:12:26] did the other and you said that and you
[2:12:29] said the other and there you stand
[2:12:31] defenseless with no one to plead your
[2:12:34] case and the door swings open
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; and mercy walks in
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; and pleads your case
[2:12:44] and the and the accuser is silenced.
[2:12:49] He has nothing else to say.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; And when that happens, you better let go
[2:12:53] of some
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; terua.
[2:12:57] Glorisraise.
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; You better let go of some terua
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; blast,
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; noise, shout, battle cry, cry of joy.
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; It it is part the the root of terua is
[2:13:17] rua.
[2:13:18] And does ruach sound like anything to
[2:13:20] you? It's ruach.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; It's the same root as ruach. And what is
[2:13:26] ruach? Breath. Spirit.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; So terua
[2:13:33] is a blast, a shout, a release.
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; Something on the inside
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; that can't hold back.
[2:13:46] Sometimes it's just got to shout.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's just got to scream
[2:13:51] hallelujah.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; And every time you do from the sincerity
[2:14:11] of your spirit man, you're releasing
[2:14:15] Can I tell you that it's the same kind
[2:14:18] of of demonstration
[2:14:21] as a prophetic utterance?
[2:14:25] Because a prophetic utterance
[2:14:28] is a naba
[2:14:33] which is a bubbling up of inspiration
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; of spirit strength and it's bubbling up
[2:14:41] and the word uh uh is naba. It's a kind
[2:14:44] of release uh from a prophet. It's a
[2:14:48] prophetic release and it comes like a
[2:14:51] bubble and it comes like life and spirit
[2:14:54] and it's intricately connected to terua
[2:14:59] because it's intricately
[2:15:02] connected to rua. Somebody said all this
[2:15:05] ruaha
[2:15:07] I get so confused. That's why it's up
[2:15:09] there.
[2:15:12] Somebody said, "Well, I didn't hear
[2:15:13] brother Random talking anything like
[2:15:15] that." He talked all around it
[2:15:17] &gt;&gt; and everything he said about it blessed
[2:15:19] me.
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; But as I said a moment ago, my mind is a
[2:15:24] little more inquiring than that.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; I want to know. Is it a trumpet? Is it a
[2:15:29] voice? Is it a chauffear? I want to know
[2:15:31] because I may want to do it right there.
[2:15:35] Amen.
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; And if I know anything about the order
[2:15:38] of God and the government of God, I'll
[2:15:41] know this. There's a time for me to let
[2:15:44] my my terua be my own voice.
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; And there's a time to let it be another
[2:15:50] sound.
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; Did you know science, brain science has
[2:15:57] proven to us in this day, proven to us
[2:16:00] as though we didn't know? It has proven
[2:16:02] to us, as though we didn't know, that
[2:16:05] every cell in your body responds to the
[2:16:09] sound of your voice.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; That's why it's so powerful for you, you
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; to confess the word of God over your
[2:16:26] body, over your life, over your
[2:16:29] situation. Well, I'd feel silly to stand
[2:16:32] in the middle of the floor and quote
[2:16:34] scripture. I don't know why.
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; It's sweeter.
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; The instructions of the Lord, the word
[2:16:43] of the Lord is sweeter than honey
[2:16:47] &gt;&gt; in the honeycomb.
[2:16:49] &gt;&gt; More valuable than silver, more desired
[2:16:52] than gold.
[2:16:54] So why would it bother you to stand in
[2:16:57] the middle of the floor and let honey
[2:16:58] roll out of your mouth? Let silver come
[2:17:01] flowing out. Let gold come flowing out
[2:17:05] of your mouth.
[2:17:07] I can confess it over you and it will
[2:17:09] have it will have a marginal effect
[2:17:12] because I may be for you the voice uh
[2:17:15] that has been chosen as a pastor to you
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; and therefore spiritually God would
[2:17:21] certainly let that voice have some
[2:17:24] effect on you that that would be the
[2:17:26] purpose of you getting a revelation of
[2:17:28] who your pastor is
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; there there there's surely some
[2:17:32] effectiveness in that I would I would
[2:17:34] think
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; but it couldn't possibly be as
[2:17:36] effective.
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; As you declaring, read it. So, I don't
[2:17:41] know how to I don't know how to declare.
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; I don't know how to I don't know how to
[2:17:45] decree.
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; Do you know how to read?
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; If you don't know how to read, somebody
[2:17:53] ought to help you. Stand in the middle
[2:17:55] of the floor. Close the door. Don't tell
[2:17:57] nobody what you're doing. If you don't
[2:17:58] want to, nobody care. Get right there.
[2:18:00] Open up that book and just start
[2:18:02] speaking that word over your life, over
[2:18:05] your family.
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I I just don't know if
[2:18:09] Oh, it will."
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Can you show me that in
[2:18:11] the message?" I believe I can.
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; Just go your way.
[2:18:16] Declaring, "You're healed. I'm healed.
[2:18:18] I'm healed. I'm healed. I'm healed. I'm
[2:18:21] healed. I'm healed. I'm healed." And he
[2:18:23] did. And one day, he believed what he
[2:18:25] said.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; Am I supposed to say it even though I
[2:18:28] don't believe it? Absolutely.
[2:18:31] [Applause]
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; Because the more you say it,
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; the more opportunity it has to connect
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; with the inside of the inside
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; of who you are. And you might be like
[2:18:48] that little blind man
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; that one day he believed it
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; when he was sitting in the barber chair
[2:18:56] of the Church of Christ man who believed
[2:18:58] miracles were over
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; and he's testifying to him. I'm healed.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; Well, you didn't look healed to me.
[2:19:05] Look just as blind as you ever looked.
[2:19:07] He said, "Well, I'm healed. I'm healed.
[2:19:09] I am healed. Here ye." Stand on the
[2:19:11] street corner of that morning. Hear ye.
[2:19:13] Hear ye. He sells newspapers. Hear ye.
[2:19:15] Hear ye. I'm healed.
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; Bold,
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; daring.
[2:19:25] &gt;&gt; Get in the devil's face and scream it.
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; I know who I am.
[2:19:31] &gt;&gt; I know what the word has prophesied
[2:19:34] about me.
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; And sitting in the chair, he believes
[2:19:37] it. I'm healed.
[2:19:44] It was always a reality,
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; but it became a reality to him.
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; They used to have this little slogan
[2:19:55] around the message. I heard brother
[2:19:57] Billy Paul, God rest his soul.
[2:20:00] Uh what a wonderful spirit he had. Uh I
[2:20:03] heard him say, you know, things like
[2:20:05] that. Uh
[2:20:09] God thought it. Brother Brandham spoke
[2:20:10] it. I believe it. That settles it. That
[2:20:14] was his revelation
[2:20:16] and that's a wonderful thing. Nothing
[2:20:19] wrong with that. But there is a higher
[2:20:22] reality.
[2:20:26] &gt;&gt; He didn't argue with me when I suggested
[2:20:28] it to him either.
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; I said that that's your personal
[2:20:34] reality, brother Billy Paul. But there's
[2:20:37] a higher reality
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; because we don't ever want anybody to
[2:20:42] think that somebody has to believe it in
[2:20:45] order for it to be so in general.
[2:20:49] It's so whether you believe it or not.
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; It just won't be so for you.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; But the word of God is so because God
[2:21:00] said it.
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; So we could say God settle God said it.
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; That settles it.
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if I want it to operate in me,
[2:21:09] I better believe it.
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; The Bible said, "My word is forever
[2:21:14] settled
[2:21:16] [Applause]
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; in the heavens.
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; It is as secure and as old and as
[2:21:24] settled as the foundations of the earth
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; because the heavens existed before the
[2:21:30] earth existed.
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; Therefore, we could say that that realm
[2:21:34] was older. It was in eternity.
[2:21:36] Therefore, there is technically nothing
[2:21:39] older. But but we understand that it was
[2:21:42] forever settled
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; in the above.
[2:21:46] &gt;&gt; Terua, blessed is the people that know
[2:21:48] the joyful teroa.
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; Tomorrow sundown is yam tera.
[2:21:56] The modern
[2:21:59] Jews, the modern Jewish
[2:22:02] movement call it Rosh Hashana.
[2:22:08] This is a throwback
[2:22:11] to Babylonian captivity.
[2:22:14] We call it that often. It means head of
[2:22:17] the year. Rosh is head. Head of the
[2:22:20] year, the beginning of the year. The
[2:22:22] thing about it is in in the Hebrew
[2:22:25] Bible, the Old Testament, there are more
[2:22:27] than one new years.
[2:22:29] There's a spiritual new year, an
[2:22:31] agricultural new year, a new year for
[2:22:33] the trees.
[2:22:36] There are multiple concepts of new years
[2:22:39] because God was already always having to
[2:22:41] give his people. There's a reason why he
[2:22:44] was always having to give his people a
[2:22:46] new beginning. Why do you think God was
[2:22:49] always having to give his people a new
[2:22:50] beginning?
[2:22:54] cuz they were always messing it up.
[2:22:58] &gt;&gt; Why do you think God has to give you
[2:22:59] one?
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; Because you're always I'm always messing
[2:23:03] it up. And so this this is nothing to
[2:23:05] build a big doctrine on all these
[2:23:08] different new years. But because
[2:23:11] the agricultural year is divided in half
[2:23:14] in in the concept of the Hebrew Bible
[2:23:17] which is your Old Testament now
[2:23:19] translated for you in English. The
[2:23:22] agricultural year is divided into two
[2:23:24] two units two six-month roughly two
[2:23:28] six-month periods. And because of that,
[2:23:30] people get a little confused
[2:23:32] because we know that the feast of
[2:23:34] unleavened bread and Passover, the
[2:23:36] spring feast open up also a new year, a
[2:23:39] spiritual new year.
[2:23:41] But this time going into the fall feast,
[2:23:45] it also represents a sense of new year.
[2:23:48] the the modern modern Judaism has called
[2:23:53] it another name and they trace that all
[2:23:57] the way back to Babylonian captivity.
[2:24:01] And the if you ever notice that the
[2:24:04] Hebrew names of the months now are
[2:24:08] different than the Hebrew names of the
[2:24:10] months in the Bible. Why do you think
[2:24:12] that is? It's the same kind of influence
[2:24:16] from the years of captivity that they
[2:24:19] spent in Babylon.
[2:24:23] You can't say anything because your days
[2:24:26] of the month, my days of the month, and
[2:24:28] my days of the week, they also come from
[2:24:32] fables and paganism.
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; And they also every time we say them, we
[2:24:37] are pronouncing the concept of false
[2:24:40] gods.
[2:24:41] But it would be very difficult not to
[2:24:43] live with some kind of sense of time if
[2:24:46] you're living in the realm of time. So
[2:24:48] we take what we have to take. I don't
[2:24:51] think the emphasis at this time of year
[2:24:53] as we learn more. I don't think it needs
[2:24:55] to be on the head of the year. I think
[2:24:58] the emphasis needs to be on the on the
[2:25:00] blasting of the chauffar. Well, somebody
[2:25:02] said, I think because we've got grace in
[2:25:04] the New Testament, it doesn't need to be
[2:25:06] emphasized at all. Well, there's a
[2:25:08] portion of this that will have
[2:25:10] fulfillment
[2:25:12] in your lifetime.
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; so you might ought at least be slightly
[2:25:18] familiar.
[2:25:20] &gt;&gt; You you're you're not going to go back
[2:25:22] and perform some kind. In fact, there
[2:25:25] are no there really are no uh
[2:25:28] restrictions, rules concerning
[2:25:32] Yamua,
[2:25:33] the feast of trumpets. There's very
[2:25:36] little about it. Some of the feasts are
[2:25:38] told uh uh that it in bibl in Bible that
[2:25:41] it represents one thing, two things,
[2:25:44] three things.
[2:25:46] But all we're told about the feast of
[2:25:48] trumpets is that it is to be a Sabbath.
[2:25:51] It is to be a day of rest. It is to be a
[2:25:53] day of reflection, a day of prayer, a
[2:25:55] day of praise. There's nothing else
[2:25:57] said. In fact, it has sometimes been
[2:26:00] referred to as the feast of the unknown.
[2:26:05] Somebody said, "Well, you know what?
[2:26:07] What's using God making a feast if it's
[2:26:10] going to be the feast of the unknown?"
[2:26:11] Because there's something there's
[2:26:13] something yet unknown.
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; It represents something unknown.
[2:26:21] &gt;&gt; It represents something unknown.
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; Did I say that right?
[2:26:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:26:27] &gt;&gt; It represents something that is yet
[2:26:30] unknown. Jesus said, "No man,
[2:26:34] &gt;&gt; no man, no woman,
[2:26:38] no little man, no little woman
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; knoweth the day,
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; nor the hour,
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; feast of the unknown
[2:26:49] directly connects
[2:26:51] the rapture of the bride, the
[2:26:54] resurrection of the bride is directly
[2:26:58] connected in the fall feast to the feast
[2:27:01] of Yum Towa,
[2:27:03] &gt;&gt; the feast of trumpet, chauffar. It's not
[2:27:06] a It's not a silver trumpet. It's not a
[2:27:10] brass trumpet. It's talking about a
[2:27:12] chauffear.
[2:27:14] It's important to know that it is the
[2:27:17] chauffear that is connected
[2:27:21] to the rapture,
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; to the resurrection
[2:27:25] &gt;&gt; of the bride.
[2:27:27] There's so many things, but my time is
[2:27:30] gone.
[2:27:31] There are so many things that we still
[2:27:34] have never gotten it all in.
[2:27:37] One of the things that is so profound to
[2:27:40] me and and a blessing to me is the same
[2:27:43] horn
[2:27:44] that is used to make
[2:27:47] uh rua,
[2:27:49] a blast,
[2:27:51] a sound, a tone, a vibration.
[2:27:55] The same horn was used with a stopper on
[2:27:57] the end and a cap on the end to fill
[2:28:00] with anointing oil.
[2:28:03] &gt;&gt; And every time a new king was anointed,
[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; even a new priest
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; anointed to serve in the holy places,
[2:28:13] the cap off.
[2:28:17] Benjamin, do you look in the studio
[2:28:19] there and and see if my ram my ram
[2:28:23] chauffar is there? So the people could
[2:28:25] see a little bit more what it look. It's
[2:28:27] a little short. You see it?
[2:28:35] Don't know why we're going through this.
[2:28:37] Oh well,
[2:28:40] cuz you didn't go to church this
[2:28:42] morning. You came here.
[2:28:46] This is a real one.
[2:28:49] This is a real one. This is a ram's
[2:28:50] horn. See it? see how it would sit. I'm
[2:28:53] not going. This is kind of
[2:28:57] but I want you to see how it's shaped.
[2:28:59] It's shaped like that.
[2:29:01] It's a real one. This is the kind
[2:29:05] This is the kind that would be blown mo
[2:29:07] most likely one like this. And this is a
[2:29:10] kind that would be used for the oil
[2:29:13] stopper cap and poured right on the
[2:29:17] head.
[2:29:19] I've done it.
[2:29:21] I've anointed people that way. You got
[2:29:25] to be willing to get greasy,
[2:29:28] &gt;&gt; oily, and you got to be willing to keep
[2:29:30] your eyes closed.
[2:29:34] It means something.
[2:29:37] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I don't know if the
[2:29:39] Bible said it did."
[2:29:41] &gt;&gt; How beautiful.
[2:29:43] &gt;&gt; How beautiful.
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:29:46] &gt;&gt; How beautiful. How pleasant it is.
[2:29:51] for brothers, for brethren to dwell
[2:29:55] together in unity,
[2:29:59] &gt;&gt; in union,
[2:30:01] &gt;&gt; in connection.
[2:30:04] &gt;&gt; And covenant is what connects us.
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; It's not just who we are, it's what we
[2:30:13] believe.
[2:30:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:30:16] &gt;&gt; That connects us.
[2:30:18] That's why we have covenant connection
[2:30:20] with people all over the world,
[2:30:25] the farthest reaches of New Zealand,
[2:30:30] even into Russia,
[2:30:32] all across Europe, the darkest places in
[2:30:36] Africa.
[2:30:37] There are people who embrace and believe
[2:30:41] what you embrace and believe. It makes
[2:30:45] us covenant brothers and sisters.
[2:30:48] And this represents covenant unity.
[2:30:53] We are one in the word.
[2:30:55] &gt;&gt; We're one in our calling.
[2:30:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. In our election. And we're one by
[2:31:00] the spirit.
[2:31:02] &gt;&gt; And the oil represents what? Spirit.
[2:31:06] &gt;&gt; It is beautiful for brethren to dwell
[2:31:09] together in unity. It is like the holy
[2:31:12] oil. Amen.
[2:31:14] &gt;&gt; It's like the oil that flowed down.
[2:31:18] &gt;&gt; Hear this.
[2:31:18] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; There is great truth in the flowing
[2:31:23] down.
[2:31:26] &gt;&gt; Every good and perfect gift.
[2:31:28] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:31:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:31:29] &gt;&gt; Comes down.
[2:31:31] &gt;&gt; It comes from above.
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; You didn't do it. You're not smart
[2:31:34] enough to do it. I'm not smart enough to
[2:31:36] do it. Anything good God has given me,
[2:31:39] he give it to me.
[2:31:41] &gt;&gt; And it come down from the father of
[2:31:43] lights, from the one who dwells above.
[2:31:46] And it and that's how the oil falls on
[2:31:48] us.
[2:31:49] &gt;&gt; When we were anointed, when we're
[2:31:50] anointed, we're talking spiritual now.
[2:31:54] &gt;&gt; He said it runs down.
[2:31:57] Look out.
[2:32:03] I don't want to offend the Greeks.
[2:32:09] It runs down Aaron's beard.
[2:32:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:18] &gt;&gt; So, we don't know who did and who
[2:32:21] didn't, but we know Aaron did and we
[2:32:24] know Jesus did
[2:32:26] &gt;&gt; because they can't pluck what's not
[2:32:28] there.
[2:32:29] &gt;&gt; It ran down that anointing oil. It ran
[2:32:33] and all the way down to the hymn of the
[2:32:36] ifad to the hymn of the garment of the
[2:32:40] priest holy anointing oil. And brother,
[2:32:43] if you want me to take two two more
[2:32:45] hours here, I can and break down every
[2:32:48] ingredient of that holy anointing oil
[2:32:51] and tell you that there is so much life
[2:32:54] and so much revelation and so much truth
[2:32:57] in the ingredients in that oil and how
[2:33:00] it was made and how it was to be sacred
[2:33:03] and how that it was to be set apart and
[2:33:05] how that it represents the anointing and
[2:33:08] without the anointing. I heard somebody
[2:33:10] preaching on stream this weekend about
[2:33:13] the anointing
[2:33:18] &gt;&gt; and we've got to have him
[2:33:22] &gt;&gt; because him is the anointing is not just
[2:33:24] an it.
[2:33:26] &gt;&gt; It's not a fourth part of the godhead.
[2:33:29] &gt;&gt; It it's the spirit life of Christ.
[2:33:32] &gt;&gt; He is Messiah. Messiah means anointed
[2:33:35] one.
[2:33:38] And when we feel the anointing, what do
[2:33:41] you think we're feeling? We're feeling
[2:33:43] an increase of the presence of the
[2:33:46] anointed one.
[2:33:49] &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you, it's life.
[2:33:53] &gt;&gt; It's life to us. What about the word?
[2:33:57] The word is life.
[2:34:00] &gt;&gt; But the word can either be
[2:34:03] life or death.
[2:34:09] Because the letter of the word
[2:34:12] &gt;&gt; can kill.
[2:34:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:34:15] &gt;&gt; But you pour that oil.
[2:34:20] &gt;&gt; The anointing is not a feeling.
[2:34:23] &gt;&gt; So all of you who say, "I didn't feel
[2:34:25] the anointing." Don't be surprised
[2:34:28] because sometimes you may feel and sense
[2:34:32] the anointing and sometimes you may not
[2:34:35] know that it's there except by the
[2:34:37] results
[2:34:40] &gt;&gt; not by how you felt.
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; Because God may have you in a sober
[2:34:44] mind. He may have you in a sober mind so
[2:34:46] that you can sit there and say Jesus
[2:34:48] Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus. If you
[2:34:51] get drunk, if you get lost in the
[2:34:53] spirit, there might not be anybody
[2:34:54] standing in the gap in that moment. So
[2:34:57] you may feel, you may not feel. How many
[2:35:00] of you know we're not living by feeling?
[2:35:03] &gt;&gt; We're living by faith. But oh, when we
[2:35:06] feel it.
[2:35:08] &gt;&gt; That's why we sing sweet,
[2:35:12] sweet
[2:35:15] anointing
[2:35:19] flowing down
[2:35:22] to make me clean.
[2:35:25] Like a mighty
[2:35:28] rushing
[2:35:30] stream.
[2:35:33] Sweet,
[2:35:35] [Music]
[2:35:36] sweet,
[2:35:39] anointing,
[2:35:43] pouring
[2:35:45] out. Ha the oil and wine
[2:35:50] all over
[2:35:52] me.
[2:35:55] It's the touch from the hand
[2:36:00] of precious Jesus
[2:36:06] dipped into
[2:36:08] [Music]
[2:36:09] the oil of the Holy
[2:36:14] Ghost.
[2:36:17] It will soothe
[2:36:20] all
[2:36:22] our fears. Tears
[2:36:25] dry away
[2:36:28] all our tears.
[2:36:32] It's the anointing
[2:36:36] that I need
[2:36:40] the most.
[2:36:42] Why don't you sing with us? Sweet.
[2:36:47] Sweet
[2:36:49] [Music]
[2:36:51] anointing.
[2:36:52] Woo!
[2:36:56] &gt;&gt; Flowing
[2:36:57] down
[2:36:59] to make me clean
[2:37:03] like a mighty yo.
[2:37:11] Oh sweet,
[2:37:14] [Music]
[2:37:15] sweet
[2:37:18] anointing.
[2:37:22] Pouring
[2:37:24] out
[2:37:26] the oil and wine
[2:37:29] all over
[2:37:32] me.
[2:37:33] [Music]
[2:37:36] pouring
[2:37:38] out the oil and wine
[2:37:43] all over
[2:37:45] me.
[2:37:46] [Laughter]
[2:37:49] God bless you. Be seated. Thank you for
[2:37:52] responding
[2:37:53] &gt;&gt; whether you're standing or not. Thank
[2:37:55] you for responding.
[2:37:58] You never know in what moment like that
[2:38:02] in the middle of the word
[2:38:05] &gt;&gt; that he'll come riding in on your praise
[2:38:08] &gt;&gt; and settle down. And once he settled
[2:38:10] down over you, you don't need any more
[2:38:12] knowledge. You don't need any more
[2:38:14] information. Once he has settled down
[2:38:16] like that, you just ask.
[2:38:19] &gt;&gt; Whatever you have need of, you just ask.
[2:38:22] Amen.
[2:38:23] &gt;&gt; I believe in that. Amen.
[2:38:25] &gt;&gt; I don't believe in gifts interrupting
[2:38:27] the preaching, but I believe in the
[2:38:29] giver.
[2:38:31] &gt;&gt; But
[2:38:32] &gt;&gt; I believe he can come whenever he gets
[2:38:34] ready.
[2:38:36] &gt;&gt; Ride. Right.
[2:38:38] &gt;&gt; I'm I think I'm sorry, but I I only feel
[2:38:41] sorry for like a half a second when I
[2:38:43] say that and then the all the sorry just
[2:38:46] runs off of me and I'm not sorry at all.
[2:38:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:38:53] &gt;&gt; He's alive. Yes.
[2:38:55] &gt;&gt; He's life to me.
[2:38:58] &gt;&gt; Now I I got to close 135. That's that's
[2:39:01] that's plenty long.
[2:39:06] We are if we if we're going to use this
[2:39:11] God's time piece,
[2:39:14] brother Brandham said, you want to know
[2:39:16] the timing of the Lord,
[2:39:18] &gt;&gt; watch Israel.
[2:39:20] &gt;&gt; Well, you've got to know who Israel is.
[2:39:22] And there's a great great controversy
[2:39:24] over who Israel is and is all Israeli
[2:39:29] citizens Israel. Of course not. Of
[2:39:32] course not. There are Arab Muslim
[2:39:36] citizens of Israel.
[2:39:39] Even though it was never founded to be a
[2:39:42] nation of citizens who were not Jews,
[2:39:46] the UN resolution was to ba make finally
[2:39:51] a homeland for the Jews. And those
[2:39:55] wicked people who say, "Why would the
[2:39:58] Jews deserve a homeland
[2:40:02] and not the Africans or the Asians?
[2:40:05] Everybody deserves a place to call home.
[2:40:10] &gt;&gt; Everybody.
[2:40:13] And that's why America has become a
[2:40:16] melting pot
[2:40:19] &gt;&gt; for those who desire to come in a legal
[2:40:22] manner.
[2:40:24] &gt;&gt; But what we don't need is all the
[2:40:26] criminals
[2:40:28] &gt;&gt; of other nations
[2:40:30] &gt;&gt; who might encroach upon our own safety
[2:40:33] and freedom. And if you don't like that,
[2:40:35] I
[2:40:36] &gt;&gt; come on.
[2:40:39] &gt;&gt; It's just common sense.
[2:40:42] &gt;&gt; And somebody said, "Well, what other
[2:40:44] religion?" Well, you understand that the
[2:40:46] Jews are not just given, they weren't
[2:40:48] just given a a homeland because of their
[2:40:51] religion. They were given also a
[2:40:53] homeland because their ethnicity and
[2:40:55] their religion is one.
[2:40:58] &gt;&gt; It cannot be said about any other
[2:40:59] nation.
[2:41:02] And it can be said and because
[2:41:05] half the Jewish population of the entire
[2:41:09] world,
[2:41:12] &gt;&gt; half was wiped out
[2:41:17] in in little over three-year period of
[2:41:19] history, half the Jewish population. No
[2:41:23] other people have proportionately
[2:41:26] suffered like they suffered. But there
[2:41:29] every person living in the modern state
[2:41:31] of Israel, no, they're not all uh
[2:41:33] spiritual Israel. They're not all true
[2:41:36] Jews. And some will tell you right away
[2:41:38] they're not Jewish. And some are
[2:41:40] Palestinian because Israel multiple
[2:41:42] times through the years has opened
[2:41:44] citizenship up for Palestinian people
[2:41:47] who could prove
[2:41:50] their dedication
[2:41:52] to hard work
[2:41:55] and separating themselves
[2:41:57] from their violent connections with
[2:42:00] Hamas or Hezbollah or the Palestinian
[2:42:04] Authority or some of those other. If if
[2:42:06] you want to come and live among us and
[2:42:08] work among us, you we want you to do
[2:42:10] that. And they have opened it up
[2:42:13] multiple times. So we can't say that a
[2:42:15] that a nation has the promise. But there
[2:42:18] are people in that nation who have the
[2:42:21] promise. There are people in this nation
[2:42:23] who have the promise.
[2:42:25] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham told us in order
[2:42:26] for them to live as full beneficiaries
[2:42:28] of their promise, they needed to be in
[2:42:30] the homeland.
[2:42:31] &gt;&gt; The same is true for you and I.
[2:42:35] But our homeland is not a geographical
[2:42:38] piece of dirt.
[2:42:39] &gt;&gt; Our homeland is the promise that is
[2:42:42] provided for us by the opening of the
[2:42:46] word.
[2:42:48] &gt;&gt; That is the promised land.
[2:42:51] &gt;&gt; The full revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:42:56] which is more than 1100 1200 tapes.
[2:42:59] &gt;&gt; He said it is Genesis
[2:43:02] &gt;&gt; to Revelation. Amen.
[2:43:04] &gt;&gt; It's all a revelation of Jesus Christ.
[2:43:09] That is our homeland. Our homeland is
[2:43:11] the word.
[2:43:12] &gt;&gt; And we can't be the full beneficiaries
[2:43:15] of being the bride of Christ, Mrs. Jesus
[2:43:18] Christ. If we live apart from the
[2:43:21] homeland,
[2:43:24] &gt;&gt; which which is not represented by icons,
[2:43:28] &gt;&gt; it's represented by lives.
[2:43:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:31] lives
[2:43:33] and truth. That's right.
[2:43:35] &gt;&gt; Not some of these fanciful things they
[2:43:37] say in the name of truth, but truth,
[2:43:40] pure truth. That's what's going to get
[2:43:43] us there.
[2:43:44] &gt;&gt; So, we're in a season of of teshovah,
[2:43:48] which is a time of of inner reflection
[2:43:51] and uh repentance. It's it's really
[2:43:55] a season of return.
[2:43:58] Come home.
[2:44:01] Come home to papa.
[2:44:03] Come home to covenant relationship.
[2:44:07] Come home.
[2:44:09] It's it's an invitation.
[2:44:12] When that trumpet sounded in scripture
[2:44:16] every year, yam trua.
[2:44:19] Every year
[2:44:21] it was a yearly call to return home.
[2:44:26] Return to abba. Return to papa. Return
[2:44:29] to the God of your fathers, the God of
[2:44:31] your mothers, the God of Abraham, the
[2:44:34] God of Isaac, the God of Jacob. By the
[2:44:36] way, that's the God of the Christian.
[2:44:41] &gt;&gt; The God of Abraham is your God. The God
[2:44:44] of the God of Isaac is your God. The guy
[2:44:46] the God of Jacob.
[2:44:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:48] &gt;&gt; Yakov, Israel, he is also your God.
[2:44:52] &gt;&gt; Allah is not your God.
[2:44:56] Pope so and so, it's not your God.
[2:45:00] &gt;&gt; Pastor, somebody is not your God.
[2:45:03] &gt;&gt; But your God is the God of Abraham,
[2:45:05] Isaac, and Jacob. And you don't have to
[2:45:07] come and be a Jew
[2:45:09] &gt;&gt; for him to be your God.
[2:45:11] &gt;&gt; But you do have to come and have
[2:45:13] covenant with him.
[2:45:15] &gt;&gt; You do. You've got to pledge your life
[2:45:17] and follow him. So every year on the
[2:45:19] Hebrew calendar according to the
[2:45:21] scripture from El 1
[2:45:25] all the way to Tish 10
[2:45:29] which is the beginning of the Hebrew
[2:45:30] month El and the and the 10th day of the
[2:45:34] Hebrew monthish which is the day of
[2:45:36] atonement is a 40-day period of God
[2:45:40] saying come home.
[2:45:42] Use this 40 days to repent if you need
[2:45:46] to repent. Use this 40 days to return.
[2:45:49] If you need to return, turn your heart
[2:45:52] back toward Papa's house.
[2:45:57] &gt;&gt; Pursue Papa and he will help you with
[2:46:01] your career. He'll help you with your
[2:46:04] family life. He'll help you with your
[2:46:06] financial situation. Pursue Papa.
[2:46:11] &gt;&gt; You're not chasing a corporate ladder.
[2:46:14] You're chasing your papa. Amen. That's
[2:46:16] right.
[2:46:17] &gt;&gt; Your aba.
[2:46:20] &gt;&gt; And when you do that,
[2:46:23] seek ye first
[2:46:26] the kingdom of God.
[2:46:28] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, I'd go there if I
[2:46:30] could." Well, you don't have to. It's
[2:46:33] come to us.
[2:46:34] &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God has come to us. You
[2:46:36] don't have to go somewhere to be a part
[2:46:38] of the kingdom of God. The kingdom of
[2:46:39] God comes to where we are. Jesus told us
[2:46:42] the kingdom of God is
[2:46:43] &gt;&gt; within. It's within. The ark of the
[2:46:46] covenant is no longer uh uh behind a
[2:46:48] curtain somewhere in a in in a Mishkan
[2:46:51] or in a temple. The the ark of the
[2:46:53] covenant has been moved.
[2:46:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, there may still exist a physical
[2:47:01] representation.
[2:47:02] In fact, I'm one who believes it's
[2:47:04] there.
[2:47:05] But that's not what we're talking about.
[2:47:07] We're talking about a mercy seat. I
[2:47:10] believe you'll hear the prophet say
[2:47:12] &gt;&gt; that there's a mercy seat within.
[2:47:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:47:17] &gt;&gt; And if there's a mercy seat, the mercy
[2:47:18] seat was a lid.
[2:47:20] &gt;&gt; I doubt you have a lid without the box.
[2:47:23] &gt;&gt; So, it's a throne.
[2:47:25] &gt;&gt; It's a throne. It was created to
[2:47:28] represent everything in the tabernacle.
[2:47:30] Everything in the temple was created to
[2:47:33] represent the furniture
[2:47:35] &gt;&gt; furnishings if you will of the throne
[2:47:38] room of our God.
[2:47:40] &gt;&gt; How do we know that? Because Moses was
[2:47:42] taken there by spirit.
[2:47:45] Saw it, came down, found a craftsman,
[2:47:48] told him what he saw. The craftsman
[2:47:50] said, "You describe it, I'll build it."
[2:47:53] And he did. And the ark of the covenant
[2:47:56] and the mercy seat on top was from the
[2:47:58] description of the throne.
[2:48:02] &gt;&gt; And sitting right on top are two of the
[2:48:04] guardians of the throne.
[2:48:06] &gt;&gt; Cherub beams.
[2:48:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:48:09] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:48:11] &gt;&gt; there were guardians. They've always
[2:48:13] been guardians. They will always be a
[2:48:16] representation of God's divine
[2:48:18] government and guardianship. And that's
[2:48:21] why he placed them with flaming swords
[2:48:25] to make sure that Adam and Eve didn't
[2:48:28] stumble back in and gain illegal access
[2:48:32] to the tree of life.
[2:48:35] &gt;&gt; They forfeited their original right to
[2:48:38] the tree of life by tasting first of the
[2:48:42] fruit of the tree of the knowledge of
[2:48:43] good and evil. That's why they had to
[2:48:46] leave the garden and leave the land of
[2:48:48] Eden. And that's why a cherubim was
[2:48:52] placed there according to the Hebrew
[2:48:54] word with a flaming sword that turned in
[2:48:57] all four directions so that no enemy
[2:49:00] would be able to stumble into the way.
[2:49:06] &gt;&gt; Wasn't just guarding the tree of life.
[2:49:09] It wasn't just guarding the garden of
[2:49:10] Eden. It was guarding the way.
[2:49:21] another time.
[2:49:24] &gt;&gt; This is about awakening and I I'm done.
[2:49:27] Have to be.
[2:49:29] The reason why we even mark it, mention
[2:49:32] it.
[2:49:34] Well, I think you're making a big
[2:49:35] doodoo. Oh, you've never seen a big
[2:49:37] to-do.
[2:49:38] I got a few big to-dos left in me.
[2:49:41] I may pull one out for you sometime,
[2:49:44] &gt;&gt; but I'm feeling my 50 years of
[2:49:47] experience
[2:49:48] yesterday. 50 years. 19 September 20th,
[2:49:52] 1975.
[2:49:56] [Applause]
[2:50:02] It's him. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[2:50:05] Yes, Lord. Thank you, Jesus,
[2:50:09] that you can not only save somebody, but
[2:50:12] you can keep somebody.
[2:50:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, I thank you for your keeping power.
[2:50:19] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[2:50:22] Aren't you thankful for his keeping
[2:50:24] power?
[2:50:28] &gt;&gt; We're going home now in a minute.
[2:50:38] The piano stool is at my house. I'm
[2:50:42] going to bring it.
[2:50:44] The altar bench is down there. I'll
[2:50:46] bring it and show you the first pull pit
[2:50:50] that I ever used.
[2:50:53] And my granny got up. She was the pastor
[2:50:55] at the time.
[2:50:59] And she said, "Now you folks know Steve
[2:51:01] just like you know me.
[2:51:04] You've seen you've seen his unusual
[2:51:07] life. All God's people have him."
[2:51:12] And uh
[2:51:15] he he believes that he's called to
[2:51:17] preach. I do too. And you were here. You
[2:51:21] saw the you saw the prophecy that Sister
[2:51:26] Cotney gave.
[2:51:28] and you've seen the how God kept his
[2:51:30] life. And so we're going to give him the
[2:51:33] pull pit and
[2:51:36] I don't know what it'll be like.
[2:51:39] It'll be God.
[2:51:41] I'm going to trust that maybe five
[2:51:44] minutes.
[2:51:48] But his big mama, that's what she called
[2:51:50] her. But his big mama will be right here
[2:51:52] to back him up. And it wasn't just my
[2:51:54] big mama. It was everybody in the room.
[2:51:56] Everybody. full support,
[2:52:01] tremendous support.
[2:52:04] And you know what makes the difference?
[2:52:12] You can map it all out. I did. I had
[2:52:14] index cards. My my my mama's mama, she
[2:52:19] said, "Honey, can I help you? Is there
[2:52:21] something I could do?" She's a little
[2:52:23] Baptist. Hadn't got the Holy Ghost yet.
[2:52:28] He said, "Can I?" I said, "Big mama, I
[2:52:31] believe I'm supposed to do this just me
[2:52:32] and him." I mean, mama, excuse me, mama,
[2:52:35] I believe I'm just supposed to do this,
[2:52:37] me and him. But I said, "You can pray."
[2:52:40] And she was about that tall. And I heard
[2:52:43] her go down the hallway
[2:52:46] and close her bedroom door. Excuse me.
[2:52:49] Close her bedroom door. And I heard her
[2:52:52] knees.
[2:52:55] I'd heard it before. I'd seen it before.
[2:52:59] She was just Baptist by faith.
[2:53:03] But I heard those knees when they hit
[2:53:05] the floor. And she cried out like a
[2:53:09] Pentecostal,
[2:53:11] "Oh Jesus, have mercy.
[2:53:14] Give him your word."
[2:53:17] And I had it all mapped out.
[2:53:20] I had wrote down there, "Bow your heads
[2:53:27] cuz I was afraid I'd forget."
[2:53:30] And he came
[2:53:33] and when he comes, you didn't need all
[2:53:35] that.
[2:53:37] &gt;&gt; I just preached. What do you give me?
[2:53:40] And uh
[2:53:43] he's been faithful. I haven't always
[2:53:45] been, but he has been faithful.
[2:53:49] This uh yearly reminder
[2:53:52] uh is to show us of an awakening.
[2:53:58] Musicians, could you come? But I'm going
[2:54:01] to give you this as you come because if
[2:54:03] I don't hit this, we hadn't we hadn't
[2:54:05] hit it.
[2:54:07] There are three great trumpets mentioned
[2:54:08] in the Bible. The first trump, the last
[2:54:12] trump, the great trump. I encourage you
[2:54:14] to write that down if you've got a pen.
[2:54:18] First Trump, last trump or trumpet.
[2:54:22] Trump is short for trumpet. First, I
[2:54:24] better say, oh, I better say trumpet,
[2:54:26] hadn't I?
[2:54:31] We're dealing in feast and not
[2:54:33] presidents.
[2:54:35] First trumpet
[2:54:37] was at Sinai.
[2:54:40] I'll preach it to you again sometime.
[2:54:41] Exodus 19:18 and 19. This is when the
[2:54:44] the giving of the instruction took place
[2:54:46] at Shàuote, which we call in Greek
[2:54:50] Pentecost.
[2:54:53] And then there's the last trump.
[2:54:56] And that last trump or trumpet, the last
[2:55:01] trumpet is the one that is sounded on
[2:55:05] the feast of trumpets. Yam trua.
[2:55:12] this season
[2:55:14] and it is the one that is directly
[2:55:17] associated with the resurrection of the
[2:55:19] dead
[2:55:21] which for us is both resurrection and
[2:55:25] rapture.
[2:55:27] So it's not a surprise that it's the
[2:55:30] feast of the unknown
[2:55:32] because no man knoweth the day nor the
[2:55:34] hour not even the angels know when that
[2:55:38] is going to sound when that moment is
[2:55:40] going to be fulfilled. We don't know the
[2:55:42] day. We don't know the hour.
[2:55:45] The Gregorian calendar is in error. And
[2:55:47] so is the Hebrew calendar. We know that.
[2:55:51] We know that it has been corrupted
[2:55:55] several times down through history. And
[2:55:58] because of that, we have no real idea
[2:56:02] if this is September 21st or not. But at
[2:56:06] some point, somebody had to say it's
[2:56:08] going to be.
[2:56:11] And the Hebrew calendar has been thus
[2:56:13] adjusted the same way. Somebody had to
[2:56:16] say. And that's why in the in the
[2:56:18] beginning, the Hebrew calendar was based
[2:56:20] on the phases of the moon. And that
[2:56:23] meant that some months were expanded
[2:56:25] longer than one year than they would be
[2:56:27] the next year because you couldn't
[2:56:29] announce a new month without a new moon.
[2:56:34] And sometime the new moon was there, but
[2:56:36] it had to be seen by at least three
[2:56:38] people.
[2:56:39] And if it was cloudy,
[2:56:42] you just hang around in August another
[2:56:44] day or two,
[2:56:46] except on the Hebrew calendar. And so we
[2:56:49] don't know the day. And this is what
[2:56:50] Jesus was saying. He knew he knew of the
[2:56:53] corruption of the calendar, which there
[2:56:55] was no Gregorian calendar. It was only
[2:56:58] it was only some they had some Greek uh
[2:57:01] replacement but the people in the Bible
[2:57:04] were were living by the lunar the moon
[2:57:08] calendar not the sun calendar but he
[2:57:11] knew that there was corruption. You put
[2:57:13] Pharisees uh and the pheriseical spirit
[2:57:15] on anything and they corrupt it. And
[2:57:18] this is why he said no man knoweth the
[2:57:19] day nor the hour not even the angels in
[2:57:23] heaven.
[2:57:25] But what he didn't say,
[2:57:27] sometimes we learn by what is said,
[2:57:29] sometimes we learn by what is not said,
[2:57:31] day or the hour. But he didn't say we
[2:57:34] won't know the season.
[2:57:39] And the season is directly connected
[2:57:42] with the feast of the unknown,
[2:57:46] which according to the Hebrew calendar
[2:57:49] begins tomorrow evening at sundown. Are
[2:57:51] you trying to tell us that the rapture
[2:57:53] would take place? I I'm not saying that
[2:57:55] at all. I In fact, I just said
[2:57:59] it's probably not even the real day.
[2:58:03] But we're in the right season. You
[2:58:05] understand?
[2:58:07] &gt;&gt; We're in the right season.
[2:58:09] &gt;&gt; Every year when those days of tesha
[2:58:13] come, the days of return and repentance,
[2:58:15] we know that we are preparing ourselves.
[2:58:18] These are called in Bible moeds
[2:58:22] or excuse me that's English to put an s
[2:58:24] on moed in Hebrew it's moedim
[2:58:28] and that's why he's he's Elohim and
[2:58:30] that's why we say cherubim it's plural
[2:58:34] and we understand
[2:58:39] what was I saying
[2:58:42] season
[2:58:44] we don't know the day we don't know the
[2:58:46] hour but we know that is soon is that
[2:58:49] teshovah comes. It's a time of
[2:58:51] repentance and return and we start
[2:58:54] preparing the Jewish people and those
[2:58:56] who keep covenant with God. We mention
[2:58:59] it. We we we celebrate in some way. We
[2:59:01] commemorate it much to the aggravation
[2:59:06] of some. And that's why I'm more
[2:59:09] determined than ever.
[2:59:13] We know that we're entering into the
[2:59:14] season of the fall feast. And if Jesus
[2:59:18] in his birth and death and life
[2:59:20] fulfilled to the letter, to the hour, to
[2:59:24] the very time, the very time that the
[2:59:27] lambs were to be slaughtered, the very
[2:59:29] day, the very time, the very place that
[2:59:33] they were to be slaughtered from the
[2:59:35] Exodus all the way up into the into the
[2:59:39] New Testament, into the time of Jesus,
[2:59:42] say, "And he was crucified the same day,
[2:59:45] the same hour in the same city where the
[2:59:48] lamb had been killed over and over and
[2:59:51] over and over and over and over and over
[2:59:53] again. He fulfilled it. He rose on the
[2:59:56] feast of first fruits,
[2:59:59] a festival of the Lord that had been
[3:00:01] celebrated from the time of Leviticus
[3:00:04] from the time of the Exodus all the way
[3:00:06] to the time of Jesus in second temple
[3:00:09] period and everything about his death
[3:00:11] and resurrection and his ascension and
[3:00:13] the pouring out of the Holy Ghost on
[3:00:16] Shàuote, Pentecost, all of it fulfilled.
[3:00:20] Then why would we not believe
[3:00:23] that there is some sort of symbol, some
[3:00:26] sort of connection to the fall feast?
[3:00:30] Well, I know there there is. It would be
[3:00:32] foolish to try to deny it.
[3:00:35] And so, we can say that it's in the
[3:00:38] season that we're entering in now that
[3:00:41] two amazing things are going to happen.
[3:00:45] One, this little bride
[3:00:49] will respond to the sound of the
[3:00:53] chauffar, not the trumpet.
[3:00:57] Every time it speaks of this, it uses
[3:01:00] the word connected to this.
[3:01:05] This is nothing without breath.
[3:01:09] &gt;&gt; Did you ever hear brother Brandham say
[3:01:12] that the voice of the resurrection
[3:01:16] would be in the bride?
[3:01:19] So, so that's what it was about.
[3:01:23] It's about something else now.
[3:01:27] &gt;&gt; It's about you and I becoming
[3:01:29] &gt;&gt; the hollowed out.
[3:01:31] &gt;&gt; Let's stand.
[3:01:35] &gt;&gt; We're becoming the hollowed out.
[3:01:38] &gt;&gt; So that a breath can
[3:01:41] &gt;&gt; Huh. can make a sound.
[3:01:45] The voice of the bridegroom, the sound
[3:01:48] of the bridegroom's message.
[3:01:52] Behold, I show you a mystery.
[3:01:54] We shall not all sleep. 1 Corinthians
[3:01:56] 15. We shall all be changed
[3:02:00] in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,
[3:02:02] at the
[3:02:04] not the first trump that shall vote,
[3:02:07] Pentecost, giving of the law at Si. Not
[3:02:10] the great trump. The great trump also
[3:02:13] takes place during this season somewhere
[3:02:16] in the future.
[3:02:19] That great trump sounds and he puts his
[3:02:23] feet on the Mount of Olives,
[3:02:27] reveals himself to the Jewish people.
[3:02:30] What is this in your hand? This is the
[3:02:31] scars that I have received in the
[3:02:33] household of my friends.
[3:02:36] That's right.
[3:02:37] &gt;&gt; They weep their way through
[3:02:40] receiving the second time what they
[3:02:43] rejected the first time. That's what he
[3:02:45] said. Scripture, Zechariah, and the
[3:02:49] prophet to this age.
[3:02:52] But this last trump
[3:02:55] is the one that wakens the dead in a
[3:02:58] moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at
[3:03:00] the last trump. For the trumpet shall
[3:03:03] sound, and the dead shall be raised
[3:03:05] incorruptible, and we shall be
[3:03:09] &gt;&gt; changed.
[3:03:10] &gt;&gt; We understand now by revelation of this
[3:03:13] message that it's not a one boom bam
[3:03:16] gone. It's a process. That's right.
[3:03:20] &gt;&gt; First Thessalonians reveals the process,
[3:03:23] &gt;&gt; but it has to start and it has to
[3:03:26] process in order to culminate.
[3:03:30] &gt;&gt; For this corruptible,
[3:03:32] [Music]
[3:03:34] &gt;&gt; must put on.
[3:03:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:03:37] &gt;&gt; Incorruption. And the mortal
[3:03:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:03:41] &gt;&gt; must put on what?
[3:03:43] &gt;&gt; 1 Thessalonians 4:16:18. For the Lord
[3:03:46] himself, the angel of the covenant, the
[3:03:49] one with a rainbow about his head.
[3:03:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:03:53] &gt;&gt; Revelation 10.
[3:03:54] &gt;&gt; For the Lord himself shall descend from
[3:03:56] heaven with a
[3:03:57] &gt;&gt; shout,
[3:03:58] &gt;&gt; which is a message.
[3:04:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:04:02] &gt;&gt; It's a truth.
[3:04:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[3:04:04] &gt;&gt; You can't have a messenger without a
[3:04:06] message.
[3:04:13] proving his word.
[3:04:17] &gt;&gt; Do you know the message? Do you know
[3:04:18] that? Do you know the sermon?
[3:04:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:04:20] &gt;&gt; Proving his word
[3:04:23] as John the Baptist was sent to forerun
[3:04:26] the first coming. Your message. Proving
[3:04:30] his word. Your message.
[3:04:35] Not you.
[3:04:36] Your message. The emphasis is never to
[3:04:39] be on but one messenger,
[3:04:42] &gt;&gt; the Lord Jesus Christ, the messenger
[3:04:45] angel of the covenant,
[3:04:49] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist, I must decrease, he
[3:04:51] must increase. Amen.
[3:04:54] but your message. Now, there are other
[3:04:55] times that messenger was put in and that
[3:04:58] is often times what they quote
[3:05:01] because they want to convince us of this
[3:05:04] unscriptural teaching that the message
[3:05:06] and the messenger are exactly the same.
[3:05:11] That's not biblically correct. It sounds
[3:05:13] good if you're trying to convince
[3:05:15] someone to believe something, but it's
[3:05:17] not biblically correct.
[3:05:21] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Ouch. Sorry. Sorry. But that
[3:05:26] message has to be the same. That message
[3:05:29] has to be that which lines up with that
[3:05:32] word that is already spoken. It has to
[3:05:35] dovetail. And when it dovetales, it's
[3:05:37] like it's like an unveiling. It's an
[3:05:39] expansion of understanding because
[3:05:42] you've got the word there as the letter
[3:05:44] and you've got the interpretation, the
[3:05:46] the inspiration of the revealing and
[3:05:48] unveiling of Jesus Christ. It comes down
[3:05:50] fits right on that word and that's
[3:05:53] that's what forerruns
[3:05:56] your message
[3:05:59] shall forrun the second coming.
[3:06:02] I believe it with all my heart. I
[3:06:04] believe the Lord has sent a message of
[3:06:06] truth to forerun the second coming of
[3:06:08] Jesus Christ.
[3:06:10] &gt;&gt; But I believe that we are slightly
[3:06:14] disadvantaged
[3:06:15] if we're only pointing it backward.
[3:06:19] Come on now.
[3:06:20] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[3:06:21] &gt;&gt; And not forward.
[3:06:24] &gt;&gt; I I believe he pointed forward
[3:06:27] &gt;&gt; and we did until the last 15, 20 years.
[3:06:30] And now it seems to be the trend to only
[3:06:32] point backward. How can you be ready for
[3:06:34] something that hasn't come yet if you're
[3:06:36] doing what the frogs did in the book of
[3:06:38] the Revelation, only looking back?
[3:06:41] &gt;&gt; Somebody's got to look back. Get the
[3:06:43] truth of Moses,
[3:06:44] &gt;&gt; right? and and the Joshua Holy Ghost, he
[3:06:48] said it has got to carry us all the way
[3:06:50] to our homeland.
[3:06:51] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[3:06:54] &gt;&gt; I'm closing. I'm closing. I'm closing
[3:06:58] with this.
[3:07:00] The rapture.
[3:07:03] First thing is a sounding, a shout, the
[3:07:05] voice, a trumpet shout, a messenger
[3:07:07] getting people ready. The second, a
[3:07:09] voice of the resurrection, the same
[3:07:10] voice.
[3:07:14] Then whose voice is it?
[3:07:18] &gt;&gt; Same voice.
[3:07:19] &gt;&gt; That a loud voice in St. John 11:38-44.
[3:07:24] The same voice
[3:07:26] &gt;&gt; that called Lazarus.
[3:07:30] &gt;&gt; I know that voice. I know that voice.
[3:07:32] How many of you can say, "Thank God I
[3:07:34] know that voice."
[3:07:36] &gt;&gt; The one that called Lazarus from the
[3:07:38] grave, getting the bride together, and
[3:07:40] then the resurrection of the dead. See
[3:07:41] to be caught up with it. Three things
[3:07:44] takes place.
[3:07:46] Now the third thing, a trumpet which
[3:07:47] always at the feast of trumpets is
[3:07:49] calling the people. Did brother Brandham
[3:07:52] just say that?
[3:07:55] &gt;&gt; Bless his heart.
[3:07:58] You think he wanted everybody to be
[3:08:00] Jews?
[3:08:03] No.
[3:08:05] He wanted us to know where to look.
[3:08:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:08:10] which always the feast of the trumpets
[3:08:12] is calling the people where to the
[3:08:14] feast. Did you know that Yam Tura the
[3:08:16] feast of the trumpets is calling us to
[3:08:19] uh atonement
[3:08:21] and atonement is calling us to
[3:08:25] tabernacles
[3:08:27] where God himself, the scripture said,
[3:08:30] will dwell with man
[3:08:32] &gt;&gt; and God himself shall wipe the tears
[3:08:35] from off of their eyes.
[3:08:40] It doesn't get much better than that.
[3:08:43] &gt;&gt; Are you there?
[3:08:44] &gt;&gt; And there'll be that'll be the bride's
[3:08:45] supper.
[3:08:47] Oh,
[3:08:49] bride supper. I thought it was a Jewish
[3:08:52] feast.
[3:08:54] The bride supper. He said the lamb
[3:08:57] supper. That's bridegroom with the
[3:09:00] bride. Woo.
[3:09:03] &gt;&gt; In the sky.
[3:09:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:09:05] The first thing that comes forth is his
[3:09:07] message calling the bride together. The
[3:09:09] next thing is a resurrection of what?
[3:09:12] [Music]
[3:09:18] &gt;&gt; The feast of the trumpet is the feast of
[3:09:20] the awakening.
[3:09:22] It awakens the bride.
[3:09:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:09:28] &gt;&gt; We need some awakening.
[3:09:31] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, we do.
[3:09:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. And then the trumpet,
[3:09:35] the feast in the heavens and this what
[3:09:37] this thing that takes place. We're
[3:09:38] ready. We're right there. Ready now. The
[3:09:40] only thing the church is coming out has
[3:09:42] got to lay before the sun, which is the
[3:09:44] sen to ripen. Make sure you don't
[3:09:46] rotten, but you ripen. If you get too
[3:09:49] much spirit,
[3:09:51] &gt;&gt; and not enough sen,
[3:09:53] &gt;&gt; which is body word, or you get too much
[3:09:55] body word and not enough moisture, which
[3:09:59] is spirit rain, spirit life,
[3:10:02] you either dry up or you rot.
[3:10:06] &gt;&gt; But if you'll lay in the presence of the
[3:10:08] S O N,
[3:10:10] &gt;&gt; not a son of man, lay in the presence of
[3:10:15] the son of man. S O N and you'll ripen.
[3:10:24] &gt;&gt; I could tell you why, but I said we were
[3:10:26] done. The great combine will come by.
[3:10:28] And it is. It's coming by now.
[3:10:32] Metaphorically, spiritually, we could
[3:10:33] say it's coming by right now. And what
[3:10:36] is it doing? It's gathering the grain
[3:10:39] into the garner
[3:10:42] with spiritual food in due season. And
[3:10:44] the wheat then the stalk is to be
[3:10:48] burned.
[3:10:50] Pretty serious business. So listen to
[3:10:52] this. And and I I'm just gonna go sit
[3:10:54] down. Benjamin, you better have a song.
[3:10:56] You better be ready. The trump, the last
[3:10:59] trumpet, listen. That will call up the
[3:11:02] bride to Christ to the rapture. 1
[3:11:04] Thessalonians 4:16 is the same trumpet
[3:11:09] that will call back Moses and Elijah,
[3:11:11] their spirit to fall on two men who will
[3:11:15] preach the gospel to the 144,000
[3:11:20] according to Revelation 11. There'll be
[3:11:22] prophets and it will be a simultaneous
[3:11:26] event.
[3:11:28] The bride goes
[3:11:32] at the sound of that trumpet, the the
[3:11:35] blast of awakening, the shout, the noise
[3:11:38] of the king, the bride goes into a
[3:11:41] change, a final change, and and the
[3:11:45] spirit that was in Elijah, the spirit
[3:11:48] that was in Moses falls down on two
[3:11:52] prophets to the Jews. and they give that
[3:11:57] great short ministry
[3:12:00] to the to the remnant of the 144,000.
[3:12:05] It's a simultaneous thing. Uh those of
[3:12:08] you who are looking at me like I just
[3:12:10] pulled that out of my ear ear canal.
[3:12:14] It's in the feast of trumpets. He said,
[3:12:16] "Now as the church, as this church, the
[3:12:20] bride is drawn together, she is taken up
[3:12:24] and that maste
[3:12:32] of the unknown.
[3:12:34] Feast of the unknown. I I I don't know.
[3:12:38] It It went by me. I made out the first.
[3:12:40] I made out the It went by me in an
[3:12:43] unknown tongue." He said, "I could not
[3:12:45] couldn't let's talk like the Kuckian. I
[3:12:49] couldn't make it out.
[3:12:55] &gt;&gt; She's taken up." And that mystery of the
[3:12:58] seventh seal or the seventh seal, the
[3:13:01] mystery of
[3:13:06] I I don't I'm not going to interpret it.
[3:13:08] I I don't think it has to be.
[3:13:13] He says it remains a mystery
[3:13:19] until the going
[3:13:22] because the revelation of the mystery is
[3:13:24] in the going.
[3:13:30] Now there's a quick short work that
[3:13:32] precedes the going.
[3:13:36] So, Brother Brandon wasn't misspeaking
[3:13:39] when he said multiple times in the
[3:13:41] preaching of the seven seal series how
[3:13:44] gracious God was to reveal six
[3:13:51] and the people kept pressuring him.
[3:13:56] You said you said you and Dr. prevailed
[3:14:00] have said
[3:14:02] that the seventh angel messenger is to
[3:14:04] do two things.
[3:14:07] So this has got to be finished.
[3:14:12] One part two part was the rest of that
[3:14:16] couldn't make it out
[3:14:19] and later you'll hear him say a time or
[3:14:21] two we have the seventh but what is it?
[3:14:25] They say they know, but they won't tell
[3:14:27] anybody.
[3:14:29] I don't have much confidence in that.
[3:14:32] But here is what he said.
[3:14:35] The mystery of the going. And the Jews
[3:14:39] is called by the mystery, not the feast
[3:14:41] of trumpets.
[3:14:44] Sometimes they get this confused.
[3:14:48] He's talking now about the seven
[3:14:50] trumpets.
[3:14:51] And he says, "What the seven seals are
[3:14:55] to the Gentiles,
[3:14:57] the seven trumpets are to the Jews." Is
[3:15:01] that right?
[3:15:02] &gt;&gt; Now, we can call that a feast, but there
[3:15:05] weren't seven trumpets in the feast of
[3:15:06] trumpets.
[3:15:08] And so, it's most likely similar, but
[3:15:12] not one in the same.
[3:15:14] And the Jews is called by the mystery of
[3:15:16] the seventh trumpet
[3:15:19] which is what?
[3:15:22] &gt;&gt; Two prophets Elijah and Moses.
[3:15:26] And they come back.
[3:15:28] Now that's how it's connected.
[3:15:31] The seventh trumpet is a another
[3:15:35] installment of the fulfillment of the
[3:15:38] seventh trumpet. Seventh trumpet.
[3:15:42] Feast of trumpets.
[3:15:44] And it causes the bride to change into
[3:15:47] into resurrection rapture. And it causes
[3:15:49] two prophets to be anointed with the
[3:15:51] spirit of Moses and the spirit of
[3:15:53] Elijah. And boy, they preach they preach
[3:15:55] their little hearts out.
[3:15:58] And the same spirit, you don't you don't
[3:16:00] have to agree with this.
[3:16:04] Just don't get my face later.
[3:16:06] The same spirit that wants to take out
[3:16:10] good men today
[3:16:13] is the same religious spirit. You say,
[3:16:15] "Well, this wasn't religious. It was
[3:16:17] political." Don't you understand that
[3:16:19] we're already in the hour
[3:16:22] &gt;&gt; where the political is the religious and
[3:16:23] the religious is the political?
[3:16:25] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[3:16:28] &gt;&gt; Didn't you understand that Babylon would
[3:16:30] change? Yes.
[3:16:32] &gt;&gt; And while everybody's harping on the
[3:16:34] reformation of the Roman Empire, what we
[3:16:37] have before us is something uh gross,
[3:16:40] something more fearful than than a
[3:16:43] physical restoration of the Roman
[3:16:44] Empire. We now have something that has
[3:16:47] morphed from religious to political and
[3:16:50] now it has become a a mixture of
[3:16:53] political power and religious power
[3:16:55] coming out of Rome.
[3:16:57] Oh,
[3:17:00] &gt;&gt; that's where we are. And the same spirit
[3:17:03] falls that wants to take out a good man
[3:17:06] testifying of truth today, biblical
[3:17:08] truth today. Listen, I weep. I don't
[3:17:10] care what you say or what you think.
[3:17:13] When I hear somebody, I know that it's
[3:17:15] we're trained in the message world.
[3:17:18] We're trained not to get excited about
[3:17:21] anything that doesn't happen around us.
[3:17:23] &gt;&gt; Come on. But when I hear, I don't care
[3:17:26] who you are.
[3:17:27] &gt;&gt; I don't care if you're serpent seed. I
[3:17:30] don't know the difference. You see,
[3:17:31] because we're not to be trying to figure
[3:17:33] out who's who's his and who's not.
[3:17:35] That's not our play. So when I hear
[3:17:37] somebody say, "I've read the Bible
[3:17:40] for the first time or for the first time
[3:17:43] in many years of my life this week, it
[3:17:47] grips my heart."
[3:17:49] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, are they going to
[3:17:51] understand what they read?" Did you?
[3:17:53] Come on.
[3:17:54] &gt;&gt; Did you understand it in the beginning?
[3:17:56] &gt;&gt; Then how do you understand it now? When
[3:17:58] he the spirit is true, when he, the
[3:18:01] spirit of truth, has come,
[3:18:03] &gt;&gt; he will lead you and guide you and
[3:18:06] direct you into all truth. So Lord, let
[3:18:09] them read their Bible this week.
[3:18:12] &gt;&gt; And if there's any representation of
[3:18:14] your life in them, you go get them next
[3:18:17] week.
[3:18:18] &gt;&gt; Your will,
[3:18:21] your will is sovereign. Your way is
[3:18:23] suffering.
[3:18:26] &gt;&gt; The reading the romance and the stupid
[3:18:29] uh AI generated
[3:18:32] pornography AI generated superhero and
[3:18:36] all the things the world
[3:18:39] anime or however you say the demonic
[3:18:42] stuff that people are so wrapped up in.
[3:18:46] &gt;&gt; What is it if somebody says I picked up
[3:18:50] a Bible?
[3:18:53] And I read
[3:18:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:19:09] [Music]

[3:38:23] come back on the believer.
[3:38:26] Lord, I thank you for it.
[3:38:31] I thank you for the revelation of your
[3:38:33] word in the end time. the understanding
[3:38:37] that you are giving to us
[3:38:45] while we are also humbled by the awesome
[3:38:47] responsibility
[3:38:50] to steward your word
[3:38:53] that you have placed within us.
[3:38:58] We ask humbly that you give us grace and

[3:39:55] building.
[3:39:57] We're asking that you will let your
[3:39:59] presence go with us as we go our
[3:40:02] separate ways
[3:40:04] until we can gather together again.
[3:40:08] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[3:40:11] we give you all the praise and glory.
[3:40:15] Amen.
[3:40:19] Thank you, Lord.
[3:40:21] Thank you, Lord.
[3:40:29] Worthy is the lamb.
[3:40:34] Worthy is the lamb.
[3:40:40] Tomorrow evening at sundown
[3:40:44] is the blowing of the chauffear
[3:40:48] as we have heard today.
[3:40:53] and
[3:40:56] got a
[3:40:58] inspiration yesterday morning
[3:41:03] that perhaps I would
[3:41:05] gather a couple of friends and blow the
[3:41:08] chauffear
[3:41:10] tomorrow at sundown.
[3:41:14] The more I thought of it, the bigger it
[3:41:16] became. And I presented the idea to
[3:41:19] brother Shelley that we would gather on
[3:41:21] the campground
[3:41:23] and whoever was interested would come.
[3:41:27] There was one problem. I forgot that we
[3:41:30] were supposed to celebrate Stephen
[3:41:33] as he is God has blessed him and he is
[3:41:38] about to marry wife. We were going to
[3:41:41] celebrate him.
[3:41:43] So,
[3:41:46] brother Joshua has been very fluid.
[3:41:49] We're going to move that time back to 6
[3:41:52] o'lock.
[3:41:54] Brother Truman, it's at brother Truman,
[3:41:56] Sister Martha's house. Brothers, we're
[3:41:58] going to move that back to 6:00 rather
[3:42:01] than 6:30.
[3:42:03] Those that are going to be doing the
[3:42:04] cooking are hopefully going to be doing
[3:42:07] it ahead of time that we can eat right
[3:42:08] away. If you can't make it there by six
[3:42:11] o'clock, come when you can come.
[3:42:14] Well, we're going to gather here on the
[3:42:16] campground tomorrow evening at 7:15.
[3:42:20] Sunset is at 7:37 and we want to blow
[3:42:23] the sha chauffear right around that
[3:42:26] time. What we're really calling for is
[3:42:30] for more of the wind of God,
[3:42:32] &gt;&gt; more of the breath of God
[3:42:35] &gt;&gt; to breathe on us
[3:42:37] &gt;&gt; on this eagle's refuge. that more of his
[3:42:40] breath. We can go back to celebrating
[3:42:43] afterward. The tradition is that we have
[3:42:47] apples and honey. I happen to know a man
[3:42:49] that has some honey. We can probably get
[3:42:52] the apples,
[3:42:54] but we're going to come at 7:15,
[3:42:57] have a little bit of worship leading up
[3:42:59] to 7:37 when the sun sets and the
[3:43:02] blowing of the chauffear. So, if you
[3:43:05] wish to join us, anybody that's here,
[3:43:08] you wish to join us tomorrow, 7:15,
[3:43:11] outside, not here in the building,
[3:43:14] outside, and we're going to have a
[3:43:16] little time of worship and blowing of
[3:43:18] the chauffear and perhaps some apples
[3:43:20] and honey to celebrate the new year as
[3:43:23] the Jews would do.
[3:43:26] Until then, may the Lord bless you and
[3:43:29] may his
[3:43:30] breath
[3:43:32] be increased in you.
[3:43:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:43:40] &gt;&gt; I want more of his breath
[3:43:43] &gt;&gt; in me.
[3:43:47] Because
[3:43:49] the calling of the bride in the end time
[3:43:53] is a call for the resurrection.
[3:43:56] &gt;&gt; And we want to be at the right season,
[3:43:59] the right time, the right word to call
[3:44:03] forth what he has called us to be. Love
[3:44:06] one another as you leave today
[3:44:10] in the fear of the Lord.
[3:44:13] You're worthy of it all.
[3:44:18] [Music]
[3:44:20] You're worthy of it all.
[3:44:25] [Music]
[3:44:28] For from you are all things
[3:44:32] and to you are all things.
[3:44:36] You deserve the glory.
