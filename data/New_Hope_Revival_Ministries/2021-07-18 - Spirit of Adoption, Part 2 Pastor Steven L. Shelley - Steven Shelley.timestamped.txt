[38:47] and she's asking the lord for a miracle
[38:50] and her
[38:50] husband on her behalf brother azel
[38:54] from pakistan has reached out
[38:57] friday and again today his precious
[39:00] little daughter
[39:01] cherith rose is uh in the hospital now
[39:06] and i don't know if they know exactly
[39:08] what's wrong with her but he sent a
[39:09] picture
[39:10] she's very ill they need to know what's
[39:13] wrong and they need to be able to treat
[39:15] her but most of all
[39:16] we need the lord to touch her and to
[39:18] help her
[39:19] and one other request is that
[39:22] we would know the lord's perfect will
[39:25] concerning
[39:26] the setting of meetings among the amish
[39:28] believers they have
[39:30] sent a set of dates for next month we
[39:33] need the lord's perfect will
[39:35] it's a long trip or someone who's
[39:38] overcoming back trouble
[39:39] but if that's the lord's perfect will
[39:41] and this is his timing
[39:43] we want to walk in it so ask the lord to
[39:45] reveal
[39:46] his perfect will for those precious
[39:48] people there yes

[51:08] leave the service and i hope that
[51:10] doesn't mean you'll stay longer in the
[51:11] bathroom i hope you'll come on in here
[51:14] uh but at least when i walked in there
[51:17] after a service i was really feeling for
[51:19] the mothers and the little babies and
[51:20] things like that
[51:22] and i know there are people who are cold
[51:24] natured we
[51:25] had some complaining last weekend but
[51:28] what we were doing was running them a
[51:29] little
[51:30] cooler in the back to try to make up for
[51:33] for the vestibules so
[51:35] always bring a shawl or a wrap
[51:39] or a blanket or an overcoat or something
[51:43] because you might be a little different
[51:45] blooded than the rest
[51:46] and we want you to be comfortable too
[51:48] it's not we didn't
[51:50] sit set out to try to make you
[51:51] uncomfortable i assure you of that
[51:54] and uh so please keep that in mind
[51:57] we're so thankful to be here this
[52:00] morning and the presence of the lord
[52:02] i had a big surprise right before the
[52:05] service i overheard ben
[52:07] asking joshua to lead the service it's
[52:09] certainly not the first time you've
[52:10] asked him is it
[52:12] many many many times he's asking and
[52:14] every time the answer is not not now or
[52:17] no
[52:17] or i can't this morning or i don't have
[52:20] time not prepared not ready
[52:22] whatever and so this morning he said yes
[52:25] and i think he did a great job
[52:27] appreciate it so much
[52:31] and there wasn't enough time to change
[52:34] keys to get the right key to
[52:36] make it so we just we just slid into it
[52:39] but i appreciate it
[52:43] sure uh we'll let benjamin will you take
[52:47] the mic we won't make joshua well maybe
[52:49] joshua to take it he'll be down there
[52:51] close
[52:51] let joshua take it it's his word
[52:55] it's his word
[53:00] hallelujah praise god praise god
[53:05] thank you jesus joshua when you first
[53:09] started singing
[53:10] i kept hearing my spirit you've won this
[53:13] battle
[53:14] he's won this battle so many things have
[53:16] been spoken over you and we've all
[53:18] prayed for you to take your rightful
[53:19] place
[53:20] and we knew that it was coming soon but
[53:23] this morning
[53:25] was so amazing and the lord said this
[53:27] battle is over hallelujah
[53:29] you have won the victory glory you chose
[53:31] the hard way
[53:32] and you have overcome hallelujah so
[53:34] don't worry about it you're
[53:36] stepping into your rightful place and
[53:37] know that god's going to be with you
[53:39] every step of the way
[53:40] don't back down now amen amen amen amen
[53:44] amen
[53:45] oh thank you jesus
[53:51] hallelujah praise the lord you know
[53:54] everybody has their tests
[53:56] and trials and they're on our level
[53:59] they're hand-picked for us your trial
[54:02] might not even move
[54:03] me i might not even slow down for your
[54:05] trial
[54:06] you might not even think mine is a trial
[54:09] you see
[54:10] how it works they're custom made
[54:14] i don't want to brag on them do you but
[54:16] they serve a great purpose
[54:18] in us and the spirit of the lord came
[54:20] down here tuesday night in such a
[54:22] profound and precious
[54:24] way and the enemy gets stirred
[54:27] and he stirs us in our emotions and
[54:29] after the service emotions were raw
[54:32] and there were some words exchanged some
[54:34] little little heated
[54:36] moments among some of the youth but you
[54:38] know the lord is good in all of that
[54:41] and he sometimes allows us to get in
[54:44] that place so we can check
[54:45] check on ourselves see where we are
[54:47] what's really moving in us
[54:49] and i find out that most of the time
[54:53] when something like that arises
[54:55] uh it's a little bit of both both going
[54:58] through a trial
[54:59] both going through a struggle or
[55:00] something and it kind of comes out that
[55:03] way but you know what
[55:04] i'm so glad that god's not done with us
[55:07] when we fail him
[55:09] we just have to come to him and say lord
[55:11] have mercy
[55:12] uh do our best to try to make it right
[55:14] with one another and keep on keeping on
[55:17] someone asked me recently said well what
[55:19] what do you do
[55:20] if there's somebody who just won't seem
[55:22] to forgive you you just keep on going
[55:25] you do what's right you do what's right
[55:28] try to make it but just
[55:29] keep right on going don't ever look back
[55:33] if you'd like quotes i have dozens
[55:36] just keep on going he said just keep on
[55:39] going
[55:40] pleasing him if you please him you will
[55:43] be all right
[55:44] you'll be all right amen tomorrow is
[55:48] brother
[55:49] joel ryder's birthday and he
[55:52] is streaming with his wife in south
[55:55] africa so we are
[55:56] just sending a happy birthday to brother
[55:59] joe
[56:00] a great friend of ours a great friend of
[56:02] the ministries
[56:05] and uh the only other birthday i have
[56:07] this week is an important birthday too
[56:09] but it's the only other one i have
[56:11] if i'm missing one you can tell me in
[56:13] just a moment you know because i want to
[56:15] know
[56:16] i really do and if we miss an
[56:17] anniversary we want to know that we want
[56:19] to try to get it down
[56:21] but next saturday is sister judith's
[56:24] birthday and most most folks
[56:29] around here a lot of the youth anyway
[56:31] refer to her
[56:32] as juju and uh we love her so much
[56:36] she is serving her parents uh
[56:40] in canada she is believing the lord for
[56:42] to make a way and
[56:44] for circumstances to come together so
[56:47] that she could join us
[56:49] in the near future but
[56:52] she is a busy lady there and uh
[56:55] they have gone through such weather
[56:57] extremes so
[56:58] dry we've had a very wet summer here
[57:02] they've had a very dry summer there and
[57:05] very very hot and most of the believers
[57:09] there do not have air conditioning
[57:11] but they do have basements so they go
[57:13] down in those basements and they get a
[57:15] little bit cooler but i want you to know
[57:17] i got a feeling i'd still be hot in the
[57:18] basement
[57:19] and but god brought them through and a
[57:21] lot of those saints who stream our
[57:23] services
[57:24] are elderly past their 80s
[57:27] and some getting closer to 90
[57:31] and god has been good and he's been
[57:33] faithful so we send our love to all of
[57:35] them
[57:36] and we heard from juju again yesterday
[57:39] and
[57:40] we want to say in advance happy birthday
[57:42] to her
[57:43] may god just bless her abundantly let me
[57:46] announce this while you're seated and
[57:48] you can
[57:48] make note of it and uh as far as we know
[57:52] right now

[57:57] service
[57:57] in lagrange and it's the first time
[58:01] that i have been to a service there and
[58:04] they've asked

[58:13] one of our biggest families and now uh
[58:16] in-laws to boot and we're going to miss

[58:27] wouldn't want to lose you either

[1:01:24] take time
[1:01:26] uh and shine
[1:01:30] on something too much that's going on
[1:01:32] with us personal but
[1:01:35] july the 4th of 2020 we had a flood
[1:01:39] and when i say flood i don't mean a
[1:01:40] trickle i mean
[1:01:42] a flood in our house and uh
[1:01:45] it has been a long trial and but i want
[1:01:48] to thank the lord for alpha
[1:01:50] i do i hear people complaining about
[1:01:53] alpha insurance and they may have
[1:01:54] treated you terrible
[1:01:56] but they treated us amazing and they
[1:01:59] would uh
[1:02:00] they ended up settling for us
[1:02:03] for a lot of money and uh
[1:02:06] because they they figured we would not
[1:02:09] be able to patch our floor again
[1:02:10] because it had already been patched and
[1:02:13] they wanted to give us a brand new
[1:02:14] solid wood floor like we had
[1:02:18] and that is in the master bedroom the
[1:02:20] master closet the hallway
[1:02:22] uh the dining room and the living room
[1:02:25] that's a lot of wood floor
[1:02:27] and my wife had the incredible idea
[1:02:30] that we would do a lot of the work so
[1:02:32] that in the end of this
[1:02:34] we could get a little that money and uh
[1:02:37] i don't know if everybody who was
[1:02:39] helping us agreed to that or not but i
[1:02:41] want to thank every one of you
[1:02:43] who have just come and helped us uh even
[1:02:46] helped us move some things
[1:02:48] all my furniture is quite old but it is
[1:02:51] solid cherry
[1:02:52] and it is it's so heavy that the drawers
[1:02:56] are heavy to carry a drawer is heavy
[1:02:59] and they're solid as well and we just
[1:03:02] appreciate the help so much it's
[1:03:04] up all of it's up as of last night we
[1:03:07] slept on mattresses and box springs on
[1:03:09] the floor and
[1:03:10] stacy and i did and the new flooring is
[1:03:13] supposed to be coming in this week
[1:03:15] and i mean it's in it's sitting in our
[1:03:18] living room it's supposed to be going in
[1:03:20] this week
[1:03:21] and we just hope that everything will go
[1:03:23] smooth and we can have it behind us
[1:03:24] after a solid year it would be
[1:03:26] wonderful to have that finished it's
[1:03:28] hard to complain when you're getting
[1:03:30] a brand new floor but it's it i
[1:03:33] have to tell you it grieves me to see
[1:03:35] that good floor
[1:03:36] getting ripped up it it does and i'm not
[1:03:39] a tree hugger
[1:03:41] but i stood there thinking these trees
[1:03:44] will never be replaced
[1:03:46] why can't this be reused why can't
[1:03:49] something be done with this
[1:03:51] but anyway that's the way it works
[1:03:52] sometimes we don't understand
[1:03:55] but don't ever let your wife talk you
[1:03:57] into something like that
[1:03:58] if the insurance is willing to pay for
[1:04:00] it let them pay for it
[1:04:02] and you move into a hotel
[1:04:06] i give you that that final piece of
[1:04:09] advice
[1:04:10] the last thing i want to share with you
[1:04:11] i've been putting it off for two weeks
[1:04:13] now
[1:04:13] because of time and i'm going to take
[1:04:15] this moment to thank you
[1:04:17] from the bottom of my heart for praying
[1:04:20] with us
[1:04:20] concerning my mother and her medicaid
[1:04:24] and it has also been a long battle ms
[1:04:27] sherry at the nursing home told me this
[1:04:29] week ashley that she had never seen a
[1:04:31] harder battle
[1:04:32] for medicaid than the one that we had
[1:04:34] just went through but mother has been
[1:04:36] completely
[1:04:37] approved and not only that of course
[1:04:41] you know we there at the beginning of
[1:04:42] the year we had to kick in
[1:04:44] a substantial amount of money to keep
[1:04:45] her there personally while medicaid was
[1:04:48] kicking in
[1:04:49] but i got the phone call this week to
[1:04:51] say you don't owe us another penny
[1:04:54] all of that is settled and uh i can't
[1:04:57] tell at all but
[1:04:58] anyway they even gave us a small
[1:05:00] blessing that they were able to give us
[1:05:02] to help us in the future
[1:05:04] and i want to thank you for praying it
[1:05:06] was a long process
[1:05:08] but god is good so i thank you and want
[1:05:10] to thank the lord

[1:07:42] we acknowledge who you are and
[1:07:45] what you have accomplished on our behalf
[1:07:48] and now lord we are approaching your
[1:07:51] word today
[1:07:53] it's life to us its strength
[1:07:56] its help its guidance
[1:07:59] how we need that in uncertain days like
[1:08:02] the ones in which we are living
[1:08:05] we don't ask you to anoint what is
[1:08:08] already anointed eternally
[1:08:10] but we ask you to anoint our hearts and
[1:08:12] our ears
[1:08:14] that we might receive the word and
[1:08:16] anoint your servant
[1:08:17] that he might give your word forth
[1:08:21] as you have called me to do lord anoint
[1:08:24] your people
[1:08:25] that we might take it that it might
[1:08:28] root in us and that it might accomplish
[1:08:32] the things that it is sent forth into
[1:08:34] the earth to accomplish
[1:08:36] through us and we will give you glory
[1:08:39] and honor and praise for it's in the
[1:08:42] name of the lord jesus christ we pray
[1:08:45] amen and the saint said amen you may be
[1:08:49] seated
[1:08:50] i did mean to mention one thing that
[1:08:52] inspired me yesterday
[1:08:55] and that was brother steve polk came to
[1:08:58] help us get started and to help the
[1:09:01] brothers know how to run the machine
[1:09:04] and the time came he just had lingered
[1:09:06] and lingered
[1:09:08] and the time came that he was going to
[1:09:10] leave us
[1:09:11] and he said i'm going to pray and he
[1:09:14] knelt down
[1:09:15] on the hardwood floor and prayed that
[1:09:18] god would help each one
[1:09:21] that was going to help to get that floor
[1:09:22] up and i want you to know
[1:09:24] every one of us before the day was over
[1:09:26] we acknowledged that it was that prayer
[1:09:29] and it was god who answered that prayer
[1:09:32] that it helped them be able to do what
[1:09:34] they did
[1:09:35] we we we hit some hard streaks
[1:09:38] but they found some spots and when they
[1:09:41] hit an easy street we were given god
[1:09:43] pray thank you lord thank you lord thank
[1:09:46] you lord
[1:09:46] thank you brother steve for praying and
[1:09:49] you know
[1:09:50] he he tells us that on his job he does
[1:09:53] that
[1:09:53] everywhere he goes to work on the floor
[1:09:56] he prays like that and i want you to
[1:09:58] know it makes a difference
[1:09:59] and it acknowledges god to me it's like
[1:10:03] the jew who wears the keeper on his head
[1:10:06] to acknowledge that there's a god above
[1:10:08] him
[1:10:09] and when you kneel down like that maybe
[1:10:11] even seen by
[1:10:12] by those who live in the home it says i
[1:10:15] serve a god
[1:10:17] that sits above it all that's the
[1:10:19] testimony we all want to have
[1:10:21] can you say amen isaiah prophesied
[1:10:26] 600 some say 700 years
[1:10:29] before messiah was born that there was
[1:10:32] going to come
[1:10:33] a child there was going to come a son
[1:10:37] there was going to come one who would be
[1:10:39] wonderful and counselor
[1:10:40] mighty god and the everlasting father
[1:10:44] the prince of peace don't don't miss
[1:10:46] that because
[1:10:47] it gives us a great prophetic
[1:10:50] understanding
[1:10:51] of the godhead he's not only the son
[1:10:55] but he is the everlasting father
[1:10:58] there's only one being talked about in
[1:11:00] isaiah chapter nine and verse six
[1:11:03] it's not two different persons or three
[1:11:06] different persons here
[1:11:08] in the godhead but that same son
[1:11:12] that is given that also
[1:11:15] is the everlasting father it also is the
[1:11:19] child
[1:11:20] that's born to us the one upon whom
[1:11:23] shoulders the whole government of god
[1:11:26] would sit upon we're blessed to know him
[1:11:30] if you believe we're blessed to know him
[1:11:31] today say amen
[1:11:33] i didn't say just know about him we're
[1:11:35] blessed to know him
[1:11:37] in an intimate way by the spirit of
[1:11:40] adoption we
[1:11:41] are allowed to call him papa god
[1:11:44] abba father not just our father
[1:11:47] but my father there's power
[1:11:51] in that there's power in understanding
[1:11:55] the relationship
[1:11:56] that god has made available to us
[1:12:00] with him in luke chapter 2
[1:12:03] if you will look there with me a moment
[1:12:06] we're talking about again today the
[1:12:08] spirit of adoption
[1:12:10] this would be the spirit of adoption
[1:12:12] part
[1:12:14] well really part three uh
[1:12:17] but i guess we could say part two
[1:12:20] because we didn't get very far on
[1:12:22] tuesday night
[1:12:23] but the lord took us somewhere anyway so
[1:12:26] maybe we would just title this
[1:12:28] part two on the spirit of adoption one
[1:12:31] of the seven
[1:12:33] offices or administrations of the holy
[1:12:36] ghost
[1:12:37] in the personal and individual life of
[1:12:39] the believer
[1:12:41] perhaps one of the most important
[1:12:43] because this is the anointing
[1:12:45] that sets us as sons it places
[1:12:49] us in sonship it
[1:12:52] it reestablishes the truth
[1:12:55] that we have been delivered from slavery
[1:12:58] we have been delivered from bondage
[1:13:00] galatians tells us
[1:13:02] and we have been brought into a glorious
[1:13:05] kingdom
[1:13:06] translated peter talks about how we are
[1:13:09] translated into a greater
[1:13:11] kingdom and one that is not of darkness
[1:13:14] can you say amen
[1:13:15] one that is of light and this is god's
[1:13:18] gift to us
[1:13:19] luke chapter 2 and verse 52
[1:13:23] and jesus increased
[1:13:26] in wisdom and stature
[1:13:30] and in favor with god
[1:13:34] and man let me read it again and jesus
[1:13:38] increased in wisdom and stature
[1:13:42] and in favor with god
[1:13:46] and man if he were god do you believe he
[1:13:50] was god
[1:13:51] do you believe he was the word made
[1:13:53] flesh
[1:13:54] do you believe that all that was in the
[1:13:56] father was in him
[1:13:58] he would be fullness then wouldn't he he
[1:14:01] is
[1:14:01] in fact the express image
[1:14:05] of god and the entirety of the godhead
[1:14:08] the bible
[1:14:09] tells us that the entirety of the
[1:14:12] godhead
[1:14:13] dwelt in him it dwelt
[1:14:16] in his physical form but for some reason
[1:14:20] he wasn't born with it all
[1:14:25] i want you to think about the process
[1:14:28] he wasn't born in completion
[1:14:31] he who would be complete he who would be
[1:14:35] absolutely the perfect god
[1:14:38] man stay with me just a moment
[1:14:42] he who would be the first
[1:14:45] perfect god man god
[1:14:49] in spirit man in fleshly body
[1:14:54] and yet there was a process
[1:14:57] there was a development there was a
[1:15:00] growing up
[1:15:02] that had to take place in his life
[1:15:04] somebody said to me recently i don't
[1:15:07] understand
[1:15:08] why god chose to do it that way i do and
[1:15:11] i'm not a very smart man
[1:15:12] but i know why god chose to do it that
[1:15:14] way he chose to do it that way
[1:15:17] for me he chose to do it that way
[1:15:20] for you because he was looking for a
[1:15:24] patterned son
[1:15:25] he was to become a pattern son
[1:15:29] one that you and i could look at his
[1:15:31] life
[1:15:32] and pattern our life after his life
[1:15:35] knowing that if he who was god in the
[1:15:38] flesh
[1:15:39] would be born without the total
[1:15:42] completion and manifestation
[1:15:44] of what had been prophesied of him but
[1:15:46] he would grow
[1:15:48] and he would come up into the stature of
[1:15:50] the perfect man we look at that
[1:15:53] and we say if he had to do it and did it
[1:15:56] by the grace of god
[1:15:57] he turns around and said because i did
[1:16:00] because i was able
[1:16:02] you are also able the carnal answer
[1:16:06] is yeah but he was god yeah but he was
[1:16:08] man
[1:16:10] you understand yes he was god
[1:16:13] but he was man i'm going to give you
[1:16:16] some
[1:16:18] some quotations in a little while that
[1:16:20] will help you to see
[1:16:22] what god was really doing he was showing
[1:16:25] why don't you help me this morning
[1:16:27] he was showing himself approachable
[1:16:31] he was showing himself in such a way
[1:16:34] that you and i can look at him and say
[1:16:36] my
[1:16:37] if he could grow up into something then
[1:16:40] i can grow up into something
[1:16:41] as long as i've got the same spirit in
[1:16:43] me that he had in him
[1:16:46] same spirit again we look at it and we
[1:16:49] say oh but he was god
[1:16:51] yes but he was man he was growing
[1:16:55] into something did you know he had to
[1:16:57] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:17:02] he was all god yet he was all man
[1:17:08] he had to have the same infusion
[1:17:11] you see he received who god was
[1:17:14] as an earnest
[1:17:18] when he was created
[1:17:21] in the womb of mary to become a begotten
[1:17:24] son
[1:17:25] he received an earnest of all that he
[1:17:27] would be
[1:17:29] when you are born again through
[1:17:31] repentance
[1:17:32] through justification the process
[1:17:35] of the new birth begins you receive an
[1:17:38] earnest
[1:17:40] of what you will one day carry the
[1:17:42] fullness of
[1:17:43] you get enough of the spirit of god and
[1:17:46] your repentance and in your conversion
[1:17:49] to lead you to guide you to direct you
[1:17:52] to bring you to all truth the bible said
[1:17:55] but you
[1:17:55] can't get by without the baptism of the
[1:17:58] holy ghost
[1:17:59] it's not just an infilling it's not just
[1:18:02] god
[1:18:02] filling us up but it's god filling us up
[1:18:05] and then plunging
[1:18:07] us beneath the holy ghost we are
[1:18:10] baptized
[1:18:12] in the spirit just like we are immersed
[1:18:15] in baptism with water
[1:18:19] it's the same typology it speaks of the
[1:18:22] same thing
[1:18:24] and so jesus born a special child
[1:18:28] we've talked about it so many times even
[1:18:31] the father
[1:18:32] created the egg placed it in mary's womb
[1:18:36] so he already had a benefit that his
[1:18:39] cousin
[1:18:40] didn't have that all of his half
[1:18:43] siblings would not have that no other
[1:18:46] man ever born among women
[1:18:48] among men would have something that had
[1:18:51] never happened before
[1:18:52] who do you think could believe such a
[1:18:55] thing
[1:18:56] i do and i do it not by my smarts
[1:19:00] i believe it by faith and by the witness
[1:19:03] of his word
[1:19:04] and by the witness of his spirit if you
[1:19:07] know where i am
[1:19:08] say amen what a blessing it is
[1:19:11] to know what god has done for us we were
[1:19:14] singing
[1:19:15] of how far he went how much he valued us
[1:19:19] how much he loved us that he went all
[1:19:21] the way on our behalf
[1:19:22] praise god
[1:19:26] but he was a patterned son
[1:19:29] he had to increase in wisdom that means
[1:19:33] he wasn't born with all wisdom i thought
[1:19:36] he was the word made flesh he was
[1:19:38] i thought he was god he was but he was
[1:19:41] not born with all wisdom
[1:19:43] why because god designed it that way
[1:19:46] he was not born as tall as he was going
[1:19:49] to be
[1:19:50] this is not just his physical stature
[1:19:52] but it's also his stature
[1:19:54] and influence among the people but
[1:19:56] neither of them
[1:19:57] were where they were going to be when he
[1:20:00] was just a little child in the temple
[1:20:02] oh he marveled them he astonished them
[1:20:06] he was a special child no doubt but
[1:20:09] unlike the movies portray
[1:20:10] he wasn't a miracle-working little
[1:20:12] teenager
[1:20:14] he was living a rather ordinary life
[1:20:18] because he had to live long enough to be
[1:20:20] tempted in all manner
[1:20:23] help me preach somebody he had to live
[1:20:25] long enough to be tempted in all manner
[1:20:28] even as we are yet without sin
[1:20:31] so he had to increase in wisdom and
[1:20:34] stature
[1:20:34] and even in favor with god
[1:20:39] how could you be god in flesh
[1:20:42] and not come forth with the fullness
[1:20:46] of the favor of god
[1:20:50] isaiah tells us i just read it to you
[1:20:54] the scripture said for unto us
[1:20:59] a child is given
[1:21:02] that's yelled it means a child
[1:21:06] it just means that it it's in
[1:21:10] in ancient hebrew or in biblical hebrew
[1:21:13] it actually refers to a young male child
[1:21:17] it's not a genderless word it's a
[1:21:20] gendered
[1:21:21] word and it means a boy
[1:21:24] a youth a small child
[1:21:27] so for unto us a child
[1:21:30] is given or born excuse me for unto us
[1:21:34] a child is born but that child had to
[1:21:37] increase
[1:21:39] come on in wisdom that
[1:21:42] child had to increase in stature
[1:21:47] that child had to increase in favor
[1:21:51] he had to increase by obeying
[1:21:54] more and more and more as the father
[1:21:57] would require
[1:21:59] more and more and more of him why
[1:22:02] because
[1:22:02] he was going through the same process
[1:22:05] that you and i as believers would go
[1:22:08] through it's the adoption process
[1:22:11] it's the work of the spirit of adoption
[1:22:13] in our life
[1:22:14] where one day the father will be able to
[1:22:17] say about you and i
[1:22:19] this this is my beloved son
[1:22:25] in whom i am pleased to dwell in
[1:22:29] hear ye him
[1:22:32] i heard you brother robert when you were
[1:22:34] praying up here
[1:22:36] you talked about the bride hearing the
[1:22:39] word
[1:22:40] and speaking the word with courage with
[1:22:42] boldness
[1:22:44] and i want you to know that's exactly
[1:22:46] what god is depending on you and i to do
[1:22:50] and there's coming an hour that we will
[1:22:53] know
[1:22:53] that we know that we know that we have
[1:22:56] graduated to that place
[1:23:00] where our words are no longer
[1:23:03] influenced by our opinions
[1:23:08] and our emotions but a bride
[1:23:11] emerging with thus saith the lord
[1:23:16] and he told us without that
[1:23:19] without thus saith the lord she
[1:23:23] will hold her peace
[1:23:27] you know that's the hardest part
[1:23:32] doing nothing in the spirit not in the
[1:23:35] natural
[1:23:37] in the natural doing nothing is easy
[1:23:41] some of us are experts at it right
[1:23:45] but in the spirit doing nothing
[1:23:48] but standing standing in
[1:23:51] faith refusing to budge
[1:23:55] refusing to compromise what you know god
[1:23:58] has made real to you
[1:24:00] i'm telling you it's harder than the
[1:24:02] person who's always doing something
[1:24:04] for the kingdom busy busy busy busy busy
[1:24:06] busy it's wonderful to do that
[1:24:08] and you should do it when you know what
[1:24:10] god would have you to do
[1:24:11] you should be busy when you know what
[1:24:13] god is calling you to do
[1:24:14] you should be up and about the father's
[1:24:16] business but there are times
[1:24:19] that we just have to stand because we're
[1:24:22] coming to an hour
[1:24:24] we're growing up into a relationship
[1:24:27] we're growing up into a stature
[1:24:30] of the perfect man where we will speak
[1:24:33] with all heaven's authority amen
[1:24:37] and i'm telling you you know he tells us
[1:24:40] in the message
[1:24:41] of the hour that the very voice
[1:24:44] of the resurrection
[1:24:48] will be in the bride
[1:24:51] somebody said we've sure got some
[1:24:52] growing up to do we sure do
[1:24:54] but we got the one in us hallelujah
[1:24:58] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:25:00] hallelujah
[1:25:01] we've got the one in us who knows how to
[1:25:05] grow us up
[1:25:07] he knows how to hand pick
[1:25:10] he knows how to choose situations and
[1:25:14] circumstances
[1:25:15] to grow us up then as we mentioned last
[1:25:18] week
[1:25:19] are you with me i should feel you then
[1:25:23] and then as we mentioned last week there
[1:25:26] is an acceleration
[1:25:28] that has been prophesied with our
[1:25:30] maturity and we're thinking every one of
[1:25:32] us are thanking god for that
[1:25:34] but it doesn't mean we get a shortcut
[1:25:40] it just means that one of these days
[1:25:42] while standing in faith
[1:25:44] while holding our position in faith the
[1:25:46] spirit of the lord screams advance
[1:25:50] and we take something that we've left
[1:25:53] laying on
[1:25:54] the table for all these years
[1:25:57] we hear the spirit saying advance
[1:26:00] and we rush to take a hold
[1:26:04] of the promise of god and we do it in
[1:26:06] such a manner
[1:26:08] that the enemy's huffing and puffing and
[1:26:09] blowing at our doesn't even move us
[1:26:12] we are not moved so the bride is really
[1:26:15] in the most difficult place
[1:26:17] that she's ever been in she's in a place
[1:26:19] where in so many ways god is saying hold
[1:26:21] your ground
[1:26:22] stand still don't lose any ground but
[1:26:24] just hold still
[1:26:26] be faithful you know you can't sometimes
[1:26:28] you feel like i can't do much
[1:26:30] let me tell you something you can do you
[1:26:31] can be faithful
[1:26:33] i'm not going to argue with people about
[1:26:35] sleeping in church and i'm not going to
[1:26:37] argue with people about being faithful
[1:26:39] to church
[1:26:39] you know what the word said and if you
[1:26:41] don't know you know what the message of
[1:26:43] the
[1:26:43] hour said you've heard the same quotes
[1:26:46] that i've heard
[1:26:47] you know what god how the prophet taught
[1:26:49] us to respect what's going on up here
[1:26:52] the bride is in a very difficult place
[1:26:55] in this
[1:26:56] hour because sometimes we all feel like
[1:26:58] we're just
[1:27:00] in limbo we're just not really
[1:27:04] taking a lot of ground not gaining in a
[1:27:06] lot of authority
[1:27:08] but i want you to know you be faithful
[1:27:10] if you can't be a lot of things you can
[1:27:12] be faithful
[1:27:12] i want to say again if you can't be a
[1:27:15] lot of things if you can't do a lot of
[1:27:17] things
[1:27:17] you can be faithful you can be faithful
[1:27:21] to god
[1:27:22] and you know what you can be faithful to
[1:27:24] come not only come
[1:27:25] to the house of god but to come with the
[1:27:27] right spirit
[1:27:30] it's so important i want to tell you
[1:27:32] something i don't want to be one of
[1:27:34] those sitting in a service walling my
[1:27:36] eyes
[1:27:37] rolling my eyes around because i don't
[1:27:40] like what somebody's doing or saying or
[1:27:42] how they're acting or how they're
[1:27:43] dressed or
[1:27:44] how weird they i don't want to do that
[1:27:46] because i've read
[1:27:48] too many descriptions too
[1:27:51] many descriptions of the hour that will
[1:27:53] approach us
[1:27:54] just before all of heaven is backing us
[1:27:58] up
[1:27:59] and i don't want to be caught up in that
[1:28:01] because the bible tells us that we'll
[1:28:03] see the days
[1:28:04] of ananias and sapphira i'm not making a
[1:28:07] threat i don't have to i'm just standing
[1:28:09] on what the prophet said
[1:28:10] and in fact sister el frida can tell you
[1:28:13] we've been standing
[1:28:14] on that promise looking for that day
[1:28:16] since way before some of you were ever
[1:28:18] here
[1:28:19] god talked to us about that in the early
[1:28:22] 90s
[1:28:22] and it's going to be one of the final
[1:28:24] things
[1:28:26] that causes the bride to be squeezed
[1:28:29] into a place of total
[1:28:32] i mean total surrender
[1:28:36] and you say well i just didn't think
[1:28:38] that fear was what was going let me tell
[1:28:40] you something
[1:28:41] there's more than one kind of fear
[1:28:44] the fear of man will you
[1:28:47] but the fear of the lord will increase
[1:28:50] you
[1:28:51] the fear of the lord will honor you the
[1:28:54] fear of the lord will advance
[1:28:56] you if you know i'm preaching the truth
[1:28:58] you could say man
[1:28:59] it's the word of almighty god and we're
[1:29:02] coming we're coming we don't know when
[1:29:03] we have no idea don't ask
[1:29:05] we don't know when it's going to break
[1:29:07] forth but i'm listening
[1:29:09] i'm listening for a call that says
[1:29:11] advance
[1:29:12] i'm listening for a call that says
[1:29:14] you've stood you've stood on the word
[1:29:16] you've stood in position you've held
[1:29:18] your ground
[1:29:20] advance hallelujah
[1:29:23] and it doesn't matter on that day how
[1:29:25] many giants stand before us
[1:29:28] through the lord by his spirit
[1:29:32] we'll just walk right through the enemy
[1:29:35] pushing him over you know it's a promise
[1:29:37] you know it's coming so for unto us here
[1:29:40] is
[1:29:40] here is the reason here is how we know
[1:29:43] why jesus had to increase in wisdom and
[1:29:45] stature and in favor with god and man
[1:29:47] because this is how isaiah prophesied
[1:29:49] his coming would be for
[1:29:51] unto us a child is born a yelid
[1:29:54] a little boy he wasn't first a child
[1:29:58] but he was a child he was first a baby
[1:30:01] but he became a child
[1:30:03] when he was standing there teaching in
[1:30:06] the temple
[1:30:07] he was just stepping from childhood
[1:30:10] into a little bit of adolescence just
[1:30:13] coming up into that next stage
[1:30:15] that middle he's not an adult he's still
[1:30:18] a boy
[1:30:19] but he but he said he's advancing in
[1:30:21] wisdom
[1:30:22] and evidently his limited wisdom
[1:30:25] was greater than all the wisdom of the
[1:30:29] teachers of the law
[1:30:30] if he was able to astonish them with a
[1:30:33] portion of god's favor
[1:30:35] with a portion of god's wisdom and
[1:30:37] stature then they really must have been
[1:30:39] suffering in such an hour as
[1:30:41] that and we're told in history that
[1:30:43] there was great
[1:30:44] great corruption in the priesthood of
[1:30:47] the second temple period
[1:30:48] he was baffling them and astonishing
[1:30:51] them
[1:30:52] with only a portion of the wisdom that
[1:30:53] he would one day have and a portion of
[1:30:55] the knowledge that he would one day have
[1:30:57] but isaiah said for unto us a child is
[1:31:00] born and the next phrase
[1:31:01] lets us know he won't always be a child
[1:31:04] he won't always be a yellid
[1:31:08] if we're in greek he won't always be a
[1:31:10] technon
[1:31:14] one of these days he's going to be a
[1:31:15] wheels
[1:31:17] because he's going to experience
[1:31:19] adoption
[1:31:21] and the word adoption in greek is the we
[1:31:24] official
[1:31:25] which is the very science the very
[1:31:28] unfolding the very
[1:31:30] knowledge of being placed as a son
[1:31:33] it comes as a download and we receive it
[1:31:37] by
[1:31:37] faith and step up into that position
[1:31:40] into the fullness of the wisdom into the
[1:31:43] fullness of the stature
[1:31:44] into the fullness of the favor with god
[1:31:47] and with man
[1:31:48] so even though it's one jesus we're
[1:31:50] talking about here
[1:31:52] one jesus here he was first a child
[1:31:55] born into this world with only
[1:31:58] a limit a limited amount of the fullness
[1:32:02] a token amount of the fullness that he
[1:32:04] would one day carry
[1:32:06] but the prophet didn't stop there he
[1:32:08] said also
[1:32:09] unto us a son is given
[1:32:12] now that word sun is the word that means
[1:32:15] just that
[1:32:15] sun it's the word ben b-e-n
[1:32:19] so when you see the word benjamin it
[1:32:22] means
[1:32:22] son of my right hand when you're reading
[1:32:26] and it says
[1:32:28] so and so been judah the son of judah
[1:32:32] and so that word son means
[1:32:36] someone and let me tell you something
[1:32:39] little
[1:32:40] children were not usually mentioned as
[1:32:43] being the son of the father until they
[1:32:46] had graduated to something more
[1:32:48] than childhood in a genealogy
[1:32:53] when when a sun is mentioned it's
[1:32:56] usually referring to a
[1:32:58] child that is grown up and the one who
[1:33:02] is the
[1:33:03] heir notice all the sons are not
[1:33:05] mentioned but it's usually the oldest
[1:33:08] not always they're exceptions it's
[1:33:10] usually the oldest
[1:33:11] and it's usually the one that has grown
[1:33:14] up to take the place of the father
[1:33:16] that's mentioned in the genealogy not a
[1:33:18] child
[1:33:20] but a son so isaiah let us know
[1:33:23] if we could have been listening to
[1:33:25] isaiah's prophecy
[1:33:27] we would have known he will come to the
[1:33:29] earth as a child
[1:33:31] but god's gift to us will not just be
[1:33:35] the giving of a
[1:33:36] child but it will be the giving of a son
[1:33:40] one who has passed the test one who has
[1:33:44] increased in wisdom
[1:33:46] one who has grown in stature and in
[1:33:49] favor
[1:33:50] with god and man perfect and yet not in
[1:33:53] total completion
[1:33:55] until he continued to grow excuse me to
[1:33:58] grow
[1:33:59] and to manifest all that the father had
[1:34:02] designed him to do
[1:34:04] are you with me praise the lord i'm so
[1:34:06] glad
[1:34:10] i'm so thankful that the yell it became
[1:34:12] a bend
[1:34:15] that the child that was born
[1:34:18] also became a given son
[1:34:22] god gave us a
[1:34:25] son god gave me
[1:34:29] a son and adopted
[1:34:32] son one who would prove
[1:34:35] himself and it would be witnessed
[1:34:39] publicly this is the one that i have
[1:34:43] chosen to live in to dwell in
[1:34:47] and to conduct my business in and
[1:34:50] through are you still with me good
[1:34:52] because we've got a lot of ground to
[1:34:54] cover
[1:34:54] and if you're worn out now i don't know
[1:34:56] how you'll make it the rest of the day
[1:34:58] matthew chapter 3
[1:35:01] verse 16 and 17 it
[1:35:04] speaks to us of the lord's baptism
[1:35:09] and i want you to know there's a lot
[1:35:10] that was going on in that baptism
[1:35:13] that we might have missed in our church
[1:35:16] life
[1:35:17] but we're not missing it in our identity
[1:35:21] as a part of his bride we're recognizing
[1:35:24] that god was doing something publicly
[1:35:26] that day
[1:35:27] he was showing the world the work
[1:35:30] that he had intended for the son
[1:35:34] and jesus when he was baptized went up
[1:35:37] straightway
[1:35:39] out of the water and lo
[1:35:42] the heavens were opened unto him
[1:35:45] and he saw who saw jesus saul
[1:35:49] the spirit of god descending
[1:35:57] not a dove descending
[1:36:01] the spirit of god descending
[1:36:05] like a dove and lighting
[1:36:08] upon him you talk about identification
[1:36:14] do you believe there were other you
[1:36:15] believe there were other children there
[1:36:17] that day
[1:36:19] do you believe there were other men
[1:36:20] there that day other women there that
[1:36:22] day
[1:36:23] but god didn't identify himself with
[1:36:25] those other men and women
[1:36:26] he identified himself with how many
[1:36:30] only one he marked him by the spirit
[1:36:33] descending
[1:36:34] as a dove and it lit upon him
[1:36:38] i love the word does anybody else in
[1:36:40] here love the word
[1:36:42] have you picked it up this week
[1:36:48] have you fed on it this week it's life
[1:36:50] to us
[1:36:51] it's life it changes a lot it changes
[1:36:53] everything really doesn't it
[1:36:55] and this and he saw the spirit of god
[1:36:58] descending like a dove
[1:36:59] and lighting upon him and lo a voice
[1:37:02] from heaven saying
[1:37:04] this is my beloved or beloved
[1:37:09] son in whom i am
[1:37:12] well pleased
[1:37:15] if you look at that word beloved
[1:37:22] it's a whole lot like agape
[1:37:26] it's agapitos which means
[1:37:29] dearly beloved a dear esteemed worthy of
[1:37:34] love
[1:37:35] and the last definition of the beloved
[1:37:38] is
[1:37:39] favorite
[1:37:44] you want to know who the father's
[1:37:45] favorite was
[1:37:48] he identified him that day
[1:37:52] it was only on our lord that the spirit
[1:37:55] descended like a dove
[1:37:57] it was only over our lord that the voice
[1:38:00] spoken said from heaven
[1:38:02] this is my beloved son in whom i am
[1:38:07] well pleased now look at matthew 17 i
[1:38:10] wish you
[1:38:11] would have your bible if your bible is
[1:38:13] there use it this morning would you
[1:38:15] because we're going to every one of
[1:38:16] these in the gospel
[1:38:18] matthew chapter 17 it's 12 41
[1:38:21] matthew chapter 17 verse 5
[1:38:25] while he yet spake
[1:38:28] behold a bright cloud overshadowed
[1:38:32] them does anybody know anything about a
[1:38:35] bright cloud
[1:38:37] cloud by day and fire by night
[1:38:40] was this not the glory of the lord
[1:38:42] descending sure it was
[1:38:44] and behold a voice where did the voice
[1:38:47] come from
[1:38:48] from above from the cloud and what did
[1:38:51] the voice say
[1:38:52] this is my beloved son
[1:38:56] in whom i am well pleased
[1:39:00] would you read the next three words
[1:39:04] hear him what i read for you this
[1:39:08] morning
[1:39:08] in reading matthew 3 16 and 17 and
[1:39:11] matthew 17-5
[1:39:13] is i read to you the beginning
[1:39:16] and the ending of our lord's
[1:39:19] adoption process
[1:39:23] it began though he were a son
[1:39:27] he was always a beloved of the father he
[1:39:30] was always
[1:39:31] god in the flesh and yet there was a
[1:39:34] union that had to take place i'll read
[1:39:36] it in a moment
[1:39:37] in fact brother branham says up until
[1:39:39] this point
[1:39:40] he was just a man that's hard for me to
[1:39:44] get my head around
[1:39:45] but i'm just telling you what a prophet
[1:39:47] said from the word
[1:39:50] he said he was just a man up until this
[1:39:53] point
[1:39:53] but on this day the father
[1:39:56] identified this man as
[1:40:00] being an offspring
[1:40:04] a son of god
[1:40:08] now how was he the son of god because
[1:40:11] the seed of god
[1:40:13] was in him
[1:40:17] how did he get there come on
[1:40:21] god put it there did you know you're a
[1:40:24] son of god
[1:40:26] did you know if you're a son of god the
[1:40:28] seed of god dwells in you
[1:40:32] if the seed of god dwells in you how
[1:40:34] they together
[1:40:36] god put it in there it was his to give
[1:40:41] it was his seed you are his offspring
[1:40:46] jesus was announced that day as
[1:40:49] not just a radical prophet
[1:40:53] this isn't even another john the baptist
[1:40:56] i want you to know they were looking at
[1:40:57] john the baptist like a crazy man
[1:41:00] and the father wanted him to know i'm
[1:41:02] identifying this one
[1:41:04] right here as my very
[1:41:07] own beloved son
[1:41:11] and i want you to know i'm pleased
[1:41:14] with my son and i'm pleased to live
[1:41:20] in my son that was the beginning of the
[1:41:24] adoption process that even a child
[1:41:28] the child the offspring of god
[1:41:31] had to go through so that he would
[1:41:33] become the given son
[1:41:36] it's powerful if we can see that even
[1:41:38] isaiah was prophesying of something he
[1:41:40] didn't fully understand
[1:41:42] but we who have the gospels we can look
[1:41:45] back and say this is exactly
[1:41:47] what he was telling us is that a child
[1:41:50] was going to be born
[1:41:51] but eventually a son was going to be
[1:41:54] given and i want to say to you today who
[1:41:56] studied
[1:41:57] i want to say to you that this day
[1:42:00] on the jordan river a son
[1:42:04] was given
[1:42:07] bethlehem was the fulfillment
[1:42:10] of the first part you got to watch these
[1:42:12] two-part prophecies brother richard
[1:42:15] you've got to watch them because
[1:42:18] remember there's another two-part
[1:42:20] prophecy
[1:42:22] that talks about the return of the
[1:42:25] spirit of elijah
[1:42:29] the same man didn't fulfill
[1:42:32] both of those prophecies
[1:42:36] it sounded like in prophecy
[1:42:39] that one man would do both jobs
[1:42:42] but it was two so you've got to watch
[1:42:46] those two-part
[1:42:47] prophecies and here we have another one
[1:42:50] for unto you a child is born
[1:42:55] but unto you a son is given
[1:42:59] and so that day in bethlehem when mary
[1:43:02] and that little baby came forth from her
[1:43:04] body and he was
[1:43:06] wrapped in swaddling clothes and laid in
[1:43:08] a manger
[1:43:09] the first part of isaiah's prophecy was
[1:43:12] fulfilled
[1:43:14] but it was not until years later he is
[1:43:17] standing in the jordan river
[1:43:19] with john the baptizer his cousin
[1:43:22] ready to baptize him and the voice of
[1:43:25] the father
[1:43:26] speaks out and says today
[1:43:29] i've already given you a child a child
[1:43:32] has already been born unto you
[1:43:34] but today i'm going to give you a son
[1:43:38] this is him i am pleased
[1:43:42] to dwell in him and i am
[1:43:46] identifying him as my heir
[1:43:51] are you not also identified as an heir
[1:43:53] indeed an heir of god and what
[1:43:56] joint heirs with jesus christ
[1:43:59] why because you're in the same process
[1:44:01] of adoption that even our lord had to go
[1:44:03] through
[1:44:04] increasing in wisdom and stature hebrews
[1:44:07] 5
[1:44:07] 8 you knew i'd have to get to that in a
[1:44:09] minute didn't you hebrews 5
[1:44:10] 8 though we were a son
[1:44:13] though we were a son though we were a
[1:44:16] son
[1:44:17] yet learned he obedience by the things
[1:44:20] which he suffered see paul knew it
[1:44:22] you see how paul recognized what was
[1:44:25] going on
[1:44:26] that a child was born and and now
[1:44:30] a son is given and then matthew 17 5 we
[1:44:34] just read it this
[1:44:34] is my beloved son in whom i am well
[1:44:38] pleased
[1:44:38] hear ye him that is the completion
[1:44:42] that's the end of the adoption process
[1:44:45] the same work that's happening in us are
[1:44:47] you with me maybe i shouldn't have had
[1:44:49] you look at your bibles
[1:44:51] because you forget to look back up here
[1:44:54] but i thought that might help you
[1:44:55] to be able to see it let me read this to
[1:44:58] you from questions and answers on
[1:45:00] hebrews
[1:45:02] and answers on hebrews number two
[1:45:04] paragraph 386
[1:45:08] this is one that was added this morning
[1:45:09] so to help you to find it there
[1:45:13] i want you to understand sonship from
[1:45:15] the father's perspective
[1:45:18] brother branham said or as i have went
[1:45:20] through it the catholic call it
[1:45:22] the eternal sonship of god
[1:45:26] you'd be surprised how many statements
[1:45:28] of faith you might look at
[1:45:30] i don't know if you ever look at them
[1:45:32] but before i
[1:45:33] sink one dollar into a ministry
[1:45:36] i like to know what they believe it's up
[1:45:39] to you how you do
[1:45:40] i know some people are always sending
[1:45:42] money over everywhere overseas
[1:45:44] everywhere
[1:45:45] and i don't do that because i want to
[1:45:47] know now you may you may be called on to
[1:45:49] support something that you don't agree
[1:45:50] with 100
[1:45:51] that's fine we do that but i want to
[1:45:54] know
[1:45:54] and you would be surprised how many
[1:45:56] protestant
[1:45:58] churches ministries organizations will
[1:46:01] talk about
[1:46:02] in their statement of faith the catholic
[1:46:04] doctrine
[1:46:05] of the eternal sonship of jesus
[1:46:11] why should we be surprised because
[1:46:14] even the protestant churches are being
[1:46:17] formed
[1:46:19] to look more and more like their mother
[1:46:22] every day
[1:46:23] are you with me let's stand together for
[1:46:25] just a moment
[1:46:26] everyone that can hallelujah
[1:46:31] thank you jesus hallelujah
[1:46:35] lord we take this opportunity to praise
[1:46:38] you just a moment
[1:46:40] we take this opportunity just to stretch
[1:46:42] ourselves a moment
[1:46:45] to give you glory and honor and praise
[1:46:48] hallelujah
[1:46:49] to let you know how thankful we are for
[1:46:52] what you've done on our behalf
[1:46:54] oh jesus we could never
[1:46:58] thank you enough what's wrong with you
[1:47:00] can't you praise him
[1:47:03] we could never thank you enough
[1:47:08] oh for being such an example
[1:47:11] such a patterned son blessed be
[1:47:15] the name of the lord we give you glory
[1:47:19] we give you honor we give you praise
[1:47:23] for the lamb of god is worthy
[1:47:26] thou art worthy lord thou art worthy
[1:47:29] lord
[1:47:30] thou art worthy lord god bless every one
[1:47:33] of you you may be seated
[1:47:40] he said the catholic call it the eternal
[1:47:43] sonship of god
[1:47:45] which as i have said before the word
[1:47:48] doesn't even make sense
[1:47:50] he said see there cannot be an
[1:47:53] eternal son
[1:47:57] because a son had
[1:48:00] to have a beginning
[1:48:03] he was born a child
[1:48:07] before he became a son
[1:48:13] now we know trinitarian doctrine says
[1:48:16] something entirely different than that
[1:48:18] but if you can figure out how someone
[1:48:21] can always be a son
[1:48:24] and never have a creation or at least
[1:48:28] be birthed then we might look at what
[1:48:31] you have to say
[1:48:32] but even by understanding the simplicity
[1:48:36] of the words
[1:48:37] brother random said why this doesn't
[1:48:38] even make sense
[1:48:40] something called eternal son
[1:48:43] because a son had to have a beginning
[1:48:47] the father was before him right and he
[1:48:50] said
[1:48:50] so jesus had a beginning he said god
[1:48:54] had no beginning we're moving on he said
[1:48:58] see
[1:48:58] but the sun
[1:49:06] the next paragraph
[1:49:12] all right that's right so jesus had a
[1:49:15] beginning
[1:49:16] god had no beginnings see
[1:49:20] he said but the son was not that eternal
[1:49:23] sonship
[1:49:24] but the son that was with the father
[1:49:27] in the beginning was the the logos
[1:49:31] that went out of god
[1:49:35] not a son but an essence of his spirit
[1:49:40] that went out in the form of the logos
[1:49:43] it went out of god then he goes on the
[1:49:47] next paragraph 387
[1:49:49] and it was the theophany
[1:49:53] of god that went out
[1:49:56] interesting the human form
[1:50:00] that didn't have eyes like you see
[1:50:03] a better eye didn't have ears like you
[1:50:06] here
[1:50:07] but a far more hearing
[1:50:10] see it was a theophany that
[1:50:14] all this rainbow that great rainbow
[1:50:18] condescended
[1:50:19] into a theophany which is a pre
[1:50:23] in this in this case it's referring to a
[1:50:27] pre-incarnate
[1:50:28] body for christ to dwell in
[1:50:32] or a body that contains deity he said
[1:50:35] moses
[1:50:36] saw it when it passed through the rock
[1:50:39] like that
[1:50:40] he saw the back parts he said it
[1:50:43] looked like a man so when god
[1:50:47] wanted to appear as a son
[1:50:51] he had to do it in a body that had been
[1:50:54] created he created a
[1:50:56] theophany body and he stepped into that
[1:50:59] body
[1:51:00] now when did that body appear well it
[1:51:02] appeared to the hebrew children didn't
[1:51:04] it
[1:51:05] it's likely that it appeared to daniel
[1:51:07] it appeared to abraham
[1:51:09] on the road that was almighty god
[1:51:13] in a condescended form living in a body
[1:51:17] that was not like a physical flesh body
[1:51:21] but a body similar to that in appearance
[1:51:24] but created for a pre-incarnate christ
[1:51:28] to dwell in i know that that can sound
[1:51:31] using words like that
[1:51:32] it can sound a little complicated but
[1:51:34] let's just boil it down god wanted to
[1:51:36] come down
[1:51:37] he hadn't been born a son yet you're
[1:51:40] following me so far
[1:51:41] so he just made a body he didn't want to
[1:51:44] come like fire this time
[1:51:46] he didn't want to come like cloud this
[1:51:47] time he wanted to come like a priest
[1:51:50] so he just created a theophany body
[1:51:53] stepped into that body
[1:51:55] and showed up on planet earth
[1:51:58] a son in the sense that he had come from
[1:52:02] god
[1:52:03] but because there had been no birth yet
[1:52:05] only a pre-incarnate son
[1:52:08] which means no eternal sonship
[1:52:11] at that moment he was not fully the son
[1:52:14] of god
[1:52:15] he was god in a condescended form
[1:52:18] but not nearly as far as he would come
[1:52:21] when he chose to dwell in a body of
[1:52:24] flesh
[1:52:25] thank you i think i can feel you with me
[1:52:27] for a moment and i appreciate that so
[1:52:28] much
[1:52:29] can i read to these saints the maniac of
[1:52:32] gadara
[1:52:33] paragraph 32 i know some of you
[1:52:38] allow us to bog down in these reading
[1:52:41] these things but there's no
[1:52:42] way that i could bring all this to you
[1:52:45] if i went through and took it all out
[1:52:47] and listed it as
[1:52:48] points there's no way i could bring it
[1:52:51] all to you like he did
[1:52:52] it wasn't my job it wasn't my calling
[1:52:56] it was his calling he was gathering
[1:52:59] together
[1:52:59] all the things that all the reformers
[1:53:01] missed
[1:53:03] he said they all missed a bunch he said
[1:53:06] they all missed a bunch
[1:53:07] and when that one comes he's going to
[1:53:09] gather together everything
[1:53:11] he said that's why the seals had to open
[1:53:13] up there were too many truths in there
[1:53:15] that the reformers had missed why did
[1:53:18] they miss them
[1:53:18] they were sealed to them they couldn't
[1:53:20] see them if they wanted to
[1:53:23] are you with me jesus christ was god
[1:53:27] manifested in flesh jehovah god
[1:53:30] his father overshadowed the virgin mary
[1:53:34] and formed in her a blood cell which
[1:53:37] made the son christ jesus how many of
[1:53:41] you can get that
[1:53:42] why is it important to know that you
[1:53:44] need to know who jesus is
[1:53:46] because you're going to have neighbors
[1:53:48] up the street that live like hell
[1:53:52] you're in me now and they're going to
[1:53:54] tell you they love jesus
[1:53:58] and you're going to be fooled if you're
[1:53:59] not careful into thinking that they have
[1:54:02] experienced the same thing you've
[1:54:03] experienced because they say i love
[1:54:06] jesus
[1:54:06] i love the lord i can hear it in that
[1:54:09] tone i love the lord
[1:54:10] when somebody says it like that it's
[1:54:12] usually defensive i love the lord
[1:54:15] the problem is they don't know who he is
[1:54:18] it's only by the unveiling of who he is
[1:54:21] by the spirit that you and i can even
[1:54:23] really know him
[1:54:25] you can't serve him with their own heart
[1:54:27] if you don't know him
[1:54:29] and you can't know him unless he's
[1:54:31] revealed to you
[1:54:32] by the spirit you can't study on him and
[1:54:35] read on him and learn about him
[1:54:37] and know him it's a work of the inner
[1:54:39] spirit it's a work of the holy spirit in
[1:54:41] you
[1:54:42] it's the spirit of adoption that brings
[1:54:45] you from being a child born
[1:54:48] to a son given see he lived as a man
[1:54:52] listen now and at the baptism he lived
[1:54:54] as a man
[1:54:55] until he was baptized by john and jordan
[1:54:58] and immediately
[1:55:01] not a week later immediately after his
[1:55:03] baptism
[1:55:04] john bear record that's john 1
[1:55:07] john bear record seeing the holy ghost
[1:55:11] coming from heaven and descending in him
[1:55:15] whoo and going
[1:55:18] upon him the dove
[1:55:22] that descended on him
[1:55:25] was not as powerful as the one
[1:55:29] who descended in him he didn't just sit
[1:55:33] up on his head
[1:55:34] to tell the world who he was but he was
[1:55:37] filled with the fullness
[1:55:41] of god's holy ghost in the jordan
[1:55:45] river that day though we were a son
[1:55:48] though we were the word made flesh
[1:55:51] though we were all these other things
[1:55:53] yet he had to receive the same infilling
[1:55:57] and baptism of the holy ghost that you
[1:56:00] and i
[1:56:01] have to receive it's the beginning of
[1:56:03] the adoption process
[1:56:04] you don't even begin your adoption
[1:56:06] process until after you have received
[1:56:09] the baptism
[1:56:10] of the holy ghost this is when it begins
[1:56:13] well what is all this out here you're
[1:56:15] getting to know him
[1:56:17] you're getting to know him but when he
[1:56:18] comes down and identifies you as his
[1:56:24] that's when your trouble starts
[1:56:28] that's when your trouble starts
[1:56:31] that's when you make it to the devil's
[1:56:33] radar
[1:56:34] that's when he's after you with anything
[1:56:36] and everything and anybody
[1:56:38] he can use to try to hold you down and
[1:56:40] pull you back
[1:56:42] discourage you make you want to quit
[1:56:45] why because he knows that you
[1:56:48] are a child that has been born but you
[1:56:51] are about to be a
[1:56:53] son that is given
[1:56:56] he said it immediately after his baptism
[1:56:58] john bear records seeing the holy ghost
[1:57:00] coming from heaven
[1:57:01] and descending in him and going
[1:57:04] upon him that's wonderful and before
[1:57:08] that time
[1:57:09] john heard a voice in the wilderness are
[1:57:12] you with me
[1:57:14] that told him upon whom thou shall see
[1:57:17] the spirit descending
[1:57:19] and remaining that's the one
[1:57:22] that's the one whoa john got it
[1:57:26] that's the one that'll baptize with the
[1:57:30] holy ghost
[1:57:31] and fire the holy ghost may have
[1:57:36] descended upon many
[1:57:38] but this was the day that he was going
[1:57:40] to descend
[1:57:41] in one this is the one
[1:57:45] i baptize you indeed in water but
[1:57:47] there's one coming
[1:57:49] who's going to baptize you with the holy
[1:57:51] ghost
[1:57:52] and fire and jesus said when he was here
[1:57:56] on earth
[1:57:57] that i do nothing of myself it's not
[1:58:00] me it's my father and he dwelleth in me
[1:58:04] see now the bible said that god the
[1:58:07] father was in christ the son
[1:58:09] reconciling the world to himself see so
[1:58:12] he was more than a man
[1:58:14] he was a i want you to say that
[1:58:17] he was a i want you to say that he was a
[1:58:22] he was a i like that
[1:58:28] he was more than just a man
[1:58:32] he was a god man
[1:58:37] he was more than just god
[1:58:41] he was a god man he was more than just a
[1:58:44] man
[1:58:46] he was a god-man i want you to know
[1:58:49] that's powerful
[1:58:50] and now one more please jesus christ the
[1:58:53] same yesterday
[1:58:54] today and forever campbellsville
[1:58:56] kentucky paragraph 30.
[1:58:58] let me read this one to you and when
[1:59:00] jesus our carpenter's

[1:59:05] on me

[1:59:18] some people only relate to real
[1:59:21] these things don't fall in my lap even
[1:59:23] if i get an idea or an inspiration from
[1:59:25] somewhere or somebody else
[1:59:27] it's my responsibility to check these
[1:59:30] things with the word
[1:59:32] and to check them with the message of
[1:59:33] the hour come on now
[1:59:35] so many many many many many times
[1:59:38] you you may you may think i just opened
[1:59:41] up and and all these quotes are gathered
[1:59:43] together in subject

[2:00:43] inspiration
[2:00:44] because you know what i i mean i may be
[2:00:47] preparing for something
[2:00:48] god may be bringing somebody in here
[2:00:50] that's never been in here before
[2:00:52] we got to be ready to meet their need as
[2:00:54] well are you with me
[2:00:56] this if that sounded like i was being my
[2:00:58] own cheerleader maybe i was
[2:01:00] for just a moment but i'd like for you
[2:01:02] to understand where i'm coming from
[2:01:05] when you spend your whole life then and
[2:01:07] on top of that dealing with the
[2:01:08] pettiness of people
[2:01:10] it's a serious walk we're living here
[2:01:13] it's a serious responsibility
[2:01:15] hallelujah to sit in a service and watch
[2:01:18] folk act the way they act sometimes
[2:01:20] when the presence of god is moving in
[2:01:22] here one of these days brother sister
[2:01:25] i'm telling you one of these days you'll
[2:01:27] regret the moments you
[2:01:29] wasted when you could have entered into
[2:01:32] the presence of god
[2:01:34] had your needs met and your blesser
[2:01:36] blessed
[2:01:38] just a moment amen pastor
[2:01:42] it's just the truth it's just a truth
[2:01:46] let me give you something else and when
[2:01:49] jesus
[2:01:50] a carpenter's son physically speaking
[2:01:53] when he come to the earth here
[2:01:56] that's all he was known of and and the
[2:01:59] day
[2:02:00] when jesus excuse me and that day when
[2:02:03] john
[2:02:04] baptized him god
[2:02:07] vindicated him there it was
[2:02:11] an announcement god vindicated him
[2:02:15] god spoke from the heavens
[2:02:20] john saw him coming in the form
[2:02:24] of a dove and said
[2:02:27] this is my beloved son
[2:02:30] in whom i'm pleased to dwell
[2:02:33] now i love the fact that brother branham
[2:02:36] an
[2:02:36] uneducated kentucky gentleman is
[2:02:39] correcting the translator
[2:02:43] powerful it's holy ghost inspired
[2:02:47] because all you have to do is do a quick
[2:02:49] check on this
[2:02:50] somebody said well he probably got that
[2:02:52] out of the diagonal or he probably got
[2:02:53] he may have
[2:02:55] but it took a lot of boldness for
[2:02:58] somebody with an elementary school
[2:02:59] education
[2:03:00] to correct the translation of the king
[2:03:02] james version of the bible
[2:03:04] powerful i love it i love it he said now
[2:03:08] uh the right translation there is and
[2:03:11] he's absolutely right
[2:03:14] he said the right translation is whom i
[2:03:17] am pleased to dwell in
[2:03:21] it's one thing to say i'm pleased with
[2:03:23] you i'm pleased with who you are
[2:03:26] it's another thing to say you're my son
[2:03:28] and i am so pleased
[2:03:30] in who you are and how you reflect me
[2:03:32] that today i'm coming and living in you
[2:03:35] [Applause]
[2:03:36] you talk about his life even even
[2:03:38] increasing
[2:03:39] in that moment you get the fullness of
[2:03:42] god coming to live inside i'm telling
[2:03:43] you what
[2:03:45] in that moment he was more god than man
[2:03:52] brother branham is telling us here
[2:03:54] before the baptism he was only a man
[2:03:56] i would say this is how i would say it i
[2:03:58] would say that he was more man than god
[2:04:01] but on this day when he became god man
[2:04:05] he was more god than man god was doing
[2:04:08] something all right he goes on in whom
[2:04:11] i'm pleased to dwell jesus immediately
[2:04:13] anointed with god
[2:04:14] he was just a man till that time but now
[2:04:17] what did he become he become the god man
[2:04:22] oh if somebody could see a head
[2:04:26] and recognize who you are
[2:04:29] as an adopted son of god going through
[2:04:33] your process just like jesus
[2:04:37] went through his just like brother
[2:04:39] william branham
[2:04:40] had to go through his you're going
[2:04:43] through
[2:04:44] yours so that at the end of this
[2:04:50] you and i who have lived our whole life
[2:04:52] as just men
[2:04:58] we graduate to something else
[2:05:02] god men somebody said oh i couldn't go
[2:05:05] that far
[2:05:06] you don't even have to know this message
[2:05:07] to know that
[2:05:09] john g lake who was a great man of faith
[2:05:11] powerfully used of god but not a
[2:05:13] believer or follower of this message
[2:05:14] he had a revelation way back when that
[2:05:17] that's exactly what would have to take
[2:05:18] place in the end time
[2:05:20] because men wouldn't be able to get the
[2:05:21] job done but god men would
[2:05:24] men filled filled
[2:05:28] with the fullness oh yes
[2:05:32] hallelujah praise the lord
[2:05:37] he said someone telling me here not long
[2:05:39] ago as
[2:05:40] i many times referred to it as this
[2:05:42] shiftless day
[2:05:44] that he was just a prophet he was a good
[2:05:46] man he was
[2:05:47] more than that he was the anointed god
[2:05:50] the bible said
[2:05:51] god was in christ reconciling the world
[2:05:54] to himself
[2:05:55] god in christ amen the balance he's just
[2:05:58] bringing the balance
[2:06:00] oh lord have mercy you really want me to
[2:06:04] explain why we needed a prophet we
[2:06:07] needed a balance
[2:06:09] we needed a balance we needed someone
[2:06:11] unbiased
[2:06:13] we needed someone not trained by the
[2:06:15] seminary who could hear thus saith the
[2:06:18] lord
[2:06:18] that's what we needed him for so many
[2:06:21] reasons
[2:06:22] he said notice it how beautiful the
[2:06:24] father speaking are you with me
[2:06:27] the father speaking from the heavens
[2:06:29] when he
[2:06:30] was obedient 109 to baptism
[2:06:33] said this is my beloved son in whom i'm
[2:06:36] pleased to
[2:06:36] dwell in no wonder jesus could say all
[2:06:39] the power
[2:06:40] in heavens and earth is given unto my
[2:06:43] hand given
[2:06:46] that means he wasn't born with all the
[2:06:47] power that means he wasn't born
[2:06:50] a child with all the power it means he
[2:06:53] received all the power
[2:06:54] when he stepped in to the fullness of a
[2:06:57] manifested sun
[2:06:59] and there was a process between the
[2:07:01] jordan how many of you know there was a
[2:07:02] process between the jordan
[2:07:04] and the mount of transfiguration don't
[2:07:07] you tell me
[2:07:08] his was easier than yours i don't want
[2:07:09] to hear it
[2:07:12] his was tailor-made
[2:07:15] his was full of a lot of a lot of
[2:07:17] betrayals
[2:07:19] his church betrayed him i'm telling you
[2:07:22] if anybody knows
[2:07:23] what it means to go through something he
[2:07:25] did and then i have just one sentence
[2:07:27] there zoe
[2:07:28] um in in paragraph 3 41
[2:07:32] just just maybe two sentences there from
[2:07:34] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[2:07:36] let's give this just so everybody can
[2:07:38] understand
[2:07:38] what this sonship is about it's not
[2:07:40] eternal sonship
[2:07:42] but it is a sonship that has a beginning
[2:07:45] and then it has a completion
[2:07:47] it has a place of full adoption
[2:07:51] you want to you want to do some homework
[2:07:53] go to the
[2:07:54] table or go to our app and find the
[2:07:57] adoption series
[2:07:59] and listen to those sermons that brother
[2:08:01] branham preached on
[2:08:02] the adoption and hear them all and get
[2:08:05] that in your spirit
[2:08:06] and understand that there is a process
[2:08:09] but one day there is a fullness
[2:08:13] he said the god himself saying
[2:08:17] this is my beloved son in whom i'm
[2:08:19] pleased to dwell in
[2:08:20] and i'd like for you i don't mean to
[2:08:22] pressure you into working but
[2:08:24] i'd like for you to read that last
[2:08:25] sentence
[2:08:31] if you need some homework on that one
[2:08:32] hear the message oneness
[2:08:35] write that down oneness i'm not sure if
[2:08:38] there's more than one that title
[2:08:39] if there is i'll come back here on
[2:08:40] tuesday night and give you the year of
[2:08:42] the one i'm talking about
[2:08:43] all of them would be good but there is
[2:08:47] there is a truth that is revealed in the
[2:08:50] message of oneness
[2:08:51] that is so powerful for you and i to get
[2:08:53] a hold of in our own life
[2:08:55] because we who sometimes feel so far
[2:08:57] away from god
[2:09:00] need to understand that it has been
[2:09:02] modeled for us
[2:09:04] and a patterned sun has gone before us
[2:09:08] and god desires to do in your life of
[2:09:11] course
[2:09:12] you're not going to be the messiah of
[2:09:14] course you're not going to be the
[2:09:15] messiah the savior you've had a messiah
[2:09:18] you've had a savior but guess what you
[2:09:20] will be
[2:09:22] manifested sons of god fully adopted
[2:09:25] sons of god
[2:09:27] messiahs
[2:09:31] god then god women
[2:09:34] we got to have it we got to have it
[2:09:36] we'll never get out of here we'll never
[2:09:38] be able to get out of here
[2:09:40] now let me give you a little more i'm
[2:09:41] going to take a little more 112. i i
[2:09:44] i think you're i think you're moving
[2:09:47] along with me now a little bit
[2:09:49] mark chapter 1
[2:09:52] verses 10 and 11. it
[2:09:55] looks so easy sometimes from where
[2:09:57] you're sitting you know
[2:10:01] why anybody would just yearn for a place
[2:10:04] like this a
[2:10:05] position of having to feed people
[2:10:09] it's only it's only what god does it's
[2:10:11] his grace it's his mercy
[2:10:13] or we would we just couldn't do it none
[2:10:15] of us could do what we are called to do
[2:10:17] you couldn't do what you're called to do
[2:10:19] mark chapter 1
[2:10:21] verses 10 11 if if the pull of faith
[2:10:25] could be here
[2:10:26] we wouldn't have to worry about those
[2:10:27] who could never amen we wouldn't have to
[2:10:29] worry about those who sleep
[2:10:31] if there was enough people pulling in
[2:10:33] faith when the word is going forth
[2:10:35] we could just move on past all of them
[2:10:38] somebody said well what about the
[2:10:40] anointing i don't operate the
[2:10:42] anointing have you heard the message
[2:10:45] i don't operate the anointing no more
[2:10:48] than brother branham operated the gift
[2:10:52] you operate the anointing you pull
[2:10:56] the atmosphere in by your faith i just
[2:10:59] yield
[2:11:00] and and and god knows i need it i need
[2:11:03] his anointing that's why i
[2:11:04] pray and ask the lord just like you
[2:11:05] would ask the lord to anoint you i ask
[2:11:07] him for his anointing
[2:11:09] but i'm not building an atmosphere here
[2:11:11] i'm helping you
[2:11:13] we're building an atmosphere in the
[2:11:14] spirit when we come together
[2:11:17] here we just can't let anything when we
[2:11:19] once we get in here we can't let
[2:11:21] anything divide us
[2:11:29] we can fight like branham's in the
[2:11:32] backyard
[2:11:34] but when we get in here
[2:11:39] it's in our house we have no right
[2:11:43] bringing our stuff in here
[2:11:45] no no no not at all not at all not at
[2:11:47] all
[2:11:48] we don't we got to come around we got to
[2:11:50] come around when we're in the backyard
[2:11:52] we fight like branhams when we come
[2:11:53] around to the front we're one one
[2:11:55] brotherhood
[2:11:56] we're one body when we come into the
[2:11:58] house of god we're one we come to get
[2:12:00] the same thing to receive
[2:12:01] from him his spirit what he has for us
[2:12:04] you'd be surprised how effective you can
[2:12:07] be
[2:12:08] right at your seat by pulling in faith
[2:12:11] by refusing to roll your eyes around in
[2:12:13] your head
[2:12:14] don't do that don't do that
[2:12:18] get ahold of yourself somebody said i
[2:12:21] don't believe anybody would you like for
[2:12:22] us to photograph it
[2:12:24] show you how we react sometime
[2:12:27] i'm afraid that the camera may not catch
[2:12:29] it but i'm not afraid of the camera
[2:12:32] i'm more concerned about the all-seeing
[2:12:34] eye
[2:12:36] if it's the word of a man you might
[2:12:38] treat it however you would like but if
[2:12:40] it's god's word
[2:12:41] i think we should be a little more
[2:12:42] careful how we entertain it
[2:12:45] meet me included remember i grew up in
[2:12:48] an
[2:12:48] hour where you didn't put the song book
[2:12:50] on top of the bible when you laid your
[2:12:51] bible on the pew
[2:12:53] there we were just honoring a written
[2:12:55] record of god's word
[2:12:57] how much more should we honor the word
[2:12:58] when it comes forward
[2:13:00] oh yes i just can't imagine brother
[2:13:03] branham sitting on those platforms
[2:13:05] he had to hear a lot of stuff that he
[2:13:07] knew was not right
[2:13:09] when he would go and preach among the
[2:13:10] full gospel businessmen's fellowship and
[2:13:12] all these other speakers
[2:13:14] but i just can't imagine brother branham
[2:13:15] sitting there walling his eyes rolling
[2:13:17] him around in his head
[2:13:19] putting on his chapstick while the
[2:13:20] presence of god is moving in the service
[2:13:24] i can't imagine that kind of disrespect
[2:13:26] in fact
[2:13:27] one of my favorite clips of brother
[2:13:30] branham
[2:13:31] is on a night when he wasn't even
[2:13:32] preaching
[2:13:35] i believe it was jack cole but i might
[2:13:37] be wrong someone resent it to me not too
[2:13:39] long ago i believe it was jack cole
[2:13:41] was preaching um john hall if he
[2:13:44] happened to hear this he could correct
[2:13:46] me
[2:13:46] because i think he's the one that sent
[2:13:48] this to me but
[2:13:50] i think his brother jack courts are
[2:13:51] preaching away and brother branham is
[2:13:53] sitting there
[2:13:54] right on the front somewhere i don't
[2:13:55] remember if he's right on the platform
[2:13:57] or not but he's sitting there and his
[2:13:58] hands are lifted up
[2:14:00] like that and there's a glow it looks
[2:14:02] like there's tears running down his face
[2:14:04] and there's a glow on him i want you to
[2:14:06] know jack cole was preaching
[2:14:08] no i don't know what he was preaching in
[2:14:10] that moment but jack cole was a
[2:14:12] part of a trinitarian denomination
[2:14:16] brother branham must have had to hear a
[2:14:17] lot of things
[2:14:19] that he didn't like that he didn't agree
[2:14:23] with but i
[2:14:24] just cannot imagine him disrespecting
[2:14:27] a.a allen
[2:14:29] or jack cole or any of those other
[2:14:31] brothers when the word was going for
[2:14:33] he did like i do like you do going down
[2:14:35] the road in the radio preacher
[2:14:38] how many times did i listen to some of
[2:14:40] you brag about a preacher on the radio
[2:14:44] bragging bragging brag and bragging
[2:14:46] bragging now
[2:14:47] the whole kingdom fallen
[2:14:50] a whole string of sexual exploits that
[2:14:54] have destroyed his family
[2:14:56] and have toppled the ministry that he
[2:14:57] built they're still struggling
[2:14:59] to see how they'll be able to put it all
[2:15:01] together and go on
[2:15:03] that wasn't you missing something
[2:15:07] you were not amen in his life you didn't
[2:15:10] know his life
[2:15:12] nor did i there was something he brought
[2:15:14] he was one of the greatest apologists of
[2:15:16] all times
[2:15:17] there was something in what he said that
[2:15:20] resonated with you
[2:15:21] as the truth and you were amending that
[2:15:24] truth you were taking sides with the
[2:15:27] word
[2:15:28] not a man you don't have to be ashamed
[2:15:31] of
[2:15:31] that that was between him and his
[2:15:35] creator
[2:15:36] you just knew when the word was coming
[2:15:38] come on now
[2:15:40] don't you hear the word do you not hear
[2:15:42] it do you not hear it this morning
[2:15:44] can you not recognize it to be the word
[2:15:46] of god
[2:15:48] then i need a lot of prayers i got to
[2:15:50] find the word if this ain't it
[2:15:51] i got to find it mark chapter 1.
[2:15:58] did we read mark already no
[2:16:01] verse 10 and 11. here it is again we did
[2:16:04] matthew now here's mark
[2:16:06] and straightway coming up out of the
[2:16:08] water he saw the heavens open
[2:16:10] and the spirit like a dove descending
[2:16:13] upon him
[2:16:14] and there came a voice from heaven
[2:16:16] saying thou art my beloved son
[2:16:19] in whom i am well pleased what brother
[2:16:21] branham say
[2:16:22] the right translation i'm pleased to
[2:16:24] dwell
[2:16:27] now look at mark 9 that was the
[2:16:30] beginning that was the baptism that was
[2:16:32] the beginning of that option
[2:16:33] mark 9 talks about the ending and there
[2:16:36] was a cloud that overshadowed them
[2:16:38] and a voice came out of the cloud saying
[2:16:41] this is my beloved son
[2:16:46] that's right hear him
[2:16:49] hear him he's passed every
[2:16:53] test he has graduated every quiz
[2:16:58] he has proven the thesis he is who he is
[2:17:02] who i made him to be now here what he
[2:17:04] has to say
[2:17:05] because he's going to say some things
[2:17:07] that are going to upset your religion
[2:17:09] this is the father warning them you
[2:17:11] you're going from here on out
[2:17:13] you're going to hear some things they're
[2:17:15] going to shake your theology up a bit
[2:17:17] come on and he did look at some of the
[2:17:19] things that came out of his mouth
[2:17:21] after his baptism look at some things
[2:17:24] that came out of his mouth
[2:17:25] in that short period of time now well
[2:17:28] anyway
[2:17:28] i can't get to that we would see jesus
[2:17:32] 10 more minutes please we would see
[2:17:35] jesus santa maria california
[2:17:38] my brother branham could do some good
[2:17:39] preaching in california
[2:17:44] i don't know if they'd have him today do
[2:17:45] you paragraph 37
[2:17:50] he said we we know now he was born of a
[2:17:53] virgin
[2:17:54] at the age of 30 years old he was
[2:17:56] baptized by john the baptizer
[2:17:59] went into the wilderness and if that is
[2:18:01] the truth he didn't have much long
[2:18:03] not much longer after his baptism
[2:18:06] things began to roll rather quickly
[2:18:08] didn't he he said at the age of 30 years
[2:18:11] old he was baptized by john the baptizer
[2:18:13] went into the wilderness and was tempted
[2:18:15] of the devil this is what i was going to
[2:18:17] say a moment ago
[2:18:18] for 40 days and nights how would you
[2:18:21] like to come out of the baptism
[2:18:23] with a voice over your head saying this
[2:18:24] is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to
[2:18:26] dwell
[2:18:27] and immediately be driven by the spirit
[2:18:29] into the wilderness to be tempted 40
[2:18:31] days and 40 nights of the devil
[2:18:35] there's a price to pay to be an adopted
[2:18:37] son
[2:18:39] he had to pay it you have to pay it i
[2:18:42] have to pay it
[2:18:43] it's just the truth isn't it all right
[2:18:45] we're hurrying
[2:18:46] he said the first thing we notice after
[2:18:48] he come out well john saw a sign over
[2:18:50] him like a light
[2:18:52] a form of a dove came down from heaven
[2:18:55] and a voice
[2:18:56] coming from the form of a dove the
[2:18:58] spirit of god a voice coming
[2:19:00] from the spirit of god which the dove
[2:19:03] was the spirit of god
[2:19:04] saying this is my beloved
[2:19:07] son in whom i am well pleased he said
[2:19:10] now that's the king james version
[2:19:12] now the original version is something
[2:19:14] the same thing my i do hope all you
[2:19:16] precious message people
[2:19:17] who will hear this hear brother branham
[2:19:20] correcting
[2:19:22] the king james version of the bible
[2:19:27] he called it the most perfect
[2:19:30] nonetheless but all of you who have such
[2:19:34] a problem
[2:19:34] with the amplified or with any other
[2:19:36] version than the king james
[2:19:39] i'm so thankful that brother branham
[2:19:41] struck the balance
[2:19:43] he had the balance here he saw that even
[2:19:46] in that it could be sometimes explained
[2:19:50] a little clearer
[2:19:51] using the original word he said now the
[2:19:53] original version is something
[2:19:55] same thing it says in whom i'm pleased
[2:19:58] to dwell in
[2:20:00] and god dwelt in christ we know that
[2:20:03] he said it's not me that doeth the works
[2:20:06] it's my father that dwelleth in me he
[2:20:09] doeth the works
[2:20:10] saint john 5 19 is that's five

[2:20:34] hanging

[2:20:46] more

[2:20:49] that one in the back is
[2:20:51] is is getting dimmer too all right
[2:20:54] john 5 19 he said verily verily i say
[2:20:57] unto you the son can do nothing in
[2:20:59] himself
[2:21:00] but what he sees the father doing that
[2:21:02] doeth the son
[2:21:03] likewise i'm telling you when he started
[2:21:06] saying things like this
[2:21:09] that's when people started struggling
[2:21:13] he started really laying it on the line
[2:21:16] once he stepped into that adoption
[2:21:18] once he stepped into the fullness of the
[2:21:20] holy ghost give me the paradox if you
[2:21:22] will
[2:21:23] 64. bakersfield california

[2:21:42] 37
[2:21:42] we know now he was born of the virgin
[2:21:46] didn't i just read that one maybe we
[2:21:49] need to hear it again
[2:21:50] paragraph 201 when jesus was standing
[2:21:54] there and upon the shores of galilee
[2:21:57] john looked up and he saw the spirit of
[2:21:59] god like a dove
[2:22:01] descending and a voice saying this is my
[2:22:04] beloved son
[2:22:05] in whom i am pleased to dwell in brother
[2:22:07] branham he just is quoting it right
[2:22:09] there
[2:22:09] and then he goes on in whom i am pleased
[2:22:11] to dwell the same thing verb before the
[2:22:13] adverb is all see
[2:22:15] this is my beloved son in whom i am
[2:22:19] pleased to dwell in
[2:22:21] god and man becoming one
[2:22:24] uniting together for what
[2:22:27] redemption how god that
[2:22:30] covered all space and time could come
[2:22:34] down
[2:22:35] and bottle himself into a man
[2:22:38] so he could taste death for all the
[2:22:41] human race
[2:22:42] i want you to look at this next sentence
[2:22:46] the creator dying
[2:22:49] to save his creation
[2:22:54] that doesn't touch you
[2:22:58] the greatest love story of all times
[2:23:03] the creator dying to save his creation
[2:23:07] isn't that a powerful truth we're
[2:23:10] blessed
[2:23:11] oh we're blessed heaven and earth listen
[2:23:14] he goes on
[2:23:15] heavens and earth kissed each other
[2:23:19] man and god became one
[2:23:23] he said how can a man there that he
[2:23:25] might dwell in man in fellowship
[2:23:27] it's nothing but god descending trying
[2:23:29] to get
[2:23:30] to his man did you know that's what he's
[2:23:34] doing today
[2:23:36] he's trying to get to his man
[2:23:40] he's trying to get to his woman
[2:23:44] give me mark you don't have the
[2:23:46] scripture
[2:23:47] give me mark chapter 1 verse 12 and 13.
[2:23:54] i'm nearly finished in every way
[2:24:00] immediately i'm gonna go ahead and read
[2:24:02] because
[2:24:03] i know it'll take a while now i just
[2:24:05] wanted to say
[2:24:07] it is never the fault of these
[2:24:10] ladies it's a computer
[2:24:14] issue with the software that's not quite
[2:24:17] able to handle
[2:24:19] but we're getting it remedied hopefully
[2:24:22] very very soon we're working on a fix
[2:24:26] because it makes them feel terrible for
[2:24:30] a scripture to be called and then it
[2:24:31] takes so long to pull up they're
[2:24:32] literally waiting for it they're waiting
[2:24:34] for it
[2:24:35] so that you can see it but it we have a
[2:24:38] great software we just have to have some
[2:24:40] great hardware hardware
[2:24:42] that works with that great software but
[2:24:43] we're nearly there it's almost in place
[2:24:46] so please you you should always
[2:24:49] nod at these sisters when you get a
[2:24:51] chance and thank them for the work they
[2:24:52] do and
[2:24:53] nathan two at times in charity at times
[2:24:55] too but zoe and abigail they really
[2:24:58] carry it and nod adam and tell them what
[2:25:02] a good job they do
[2:25:03] and tell them you know it's not their
[2:25:06] fault
[2:25:07] now if it continues to happen with the
[2:25:09] new hardware and the new software
[2:25:15] it's on you maybe not
[2:25:20] and immediately the spirit driveth him
[2:25:24] into the wilderness
[2:25:26] and he was there in the wilderness
[2:25:29] 40 days tempted of satan and was with
[2:25:33] the wild beasts
[2:25:35] and the angels don't ever forget this
[2:25:41] mark tells it a little different
[2:25:44] and the angels ministered unto him
[2:25:51] he was identified by god
[2:25:54] as a son even in his darkest temptation
[2:26:01] in the darkest testing the long dark
[2:26:04] night of the soul the angels of god
[2:26:09] came and ministered to him
[2:26:12] did he see them he probably did but do
[2:26:15] you have to see them
[2:26:16] to receive their ministry
[2:26:19] no no no no
[2:26:23] oh how they come to minister to us
[2:26:27] to sukhoroz when we're in trouble
[2:26:31] and i'm going to share two quotations
[2:26:33] for this verb this this
[2:26:34] scripture and we're going to stop

[2:28:07] he said when jesus was here he was god
[2:28:11] god was in christ reconciling the world
[2:28:14] to himself but he never
[2:28:16] used any of his gifts
[2:28:19] when he met satan
[2:28:23] he brought the kingdom of god so low
[2:28:26] oh till the weakest of christian
[2:28:32] you hear me oh i'm not going to try to
[2:28:36] hide
[2:28:36] what this means to me
[2:28:41] he brought the kingdom of god so low
[2:28:43] till the weakest of christians can use
[2:28:45] it
[2:28:45] when satan come to him and said
[2:28:49] if thou be the son of god
[2:28:52] command these stones he said
[2:28:57] it is written
[2:29:00] notice notice he didn't say
[2:29:04] shut your mouth i'm your creator
[2:29:09] don't you know who i am
[2:29:12] i made every rock i made every volcano
[2:29:17] i made every ocean no
[2:29:22] do you believe he had power to slay the
[2:29:24] enemy do you believe he had power to
[2:29:25] smite the enemy
[2:29:26] do you believe he had miraculous
[2:29:28] supernatural power that worked above and
[2:29:31] beyond the
[2:29:31] laws of nature
[2:29:35] you believe he could have turned the
[2:29:36] devil into a bullfrog and sent him on
[2:29:38] his way
[2:29:39] he had all power and yet when satan met
[2:29:43] him
[2:29:43] he chose not to use any of the giftings
[2:29:48] not his office not his giftings
[2:29:51] not his callings he didn't have to
[2:29:55] he brought the kingdom so low see you
[2:29:58] can't
[2:29:58] you can't use your messiah ship you
[2:30:00] can't use all that either
[2:30:02] we we don't we may not be able to reach
[2:30:04] up and get on into
[2:30:05] that and and uh you know
[2:30:09] turn the devil into a snake on the
[2:30:11] ground or or whatever else you don't
[2:30:13] have to
[2:30:15] jesus was our patterned son and our
[2:30:17] example
[2:30:18] and he went before us and here's how he
[2:30:20] whipped the devil
[2:30:23] it is written the word
[2:30:26] he took him up he tried to whitewash the
[2:30:28] word for him
[2:30:29] and jesus said and it is also written he
[2:30:32] took him up to the top of the mountain
[2:30:34] said he had to look all these kingdoms i
[2:30:36] will give them to you if you worship me
[2:30:38] and what jesus do he said it is written
[2:30:41] there it is the weakest christian the
[2:30:44] weakest christian
[2:30:44] in this room has everything they need
[2:30:47] right now

[2:31:03] pain
[2:31:04] no no infirmity right now the kingdom
[2:31:07] has been brought so low
[2:31:10] that all we have to do is take up what
[2:31:12] jesus took up

[2:31:20] musicians are coming this is the last
[2:31:26] show us the father and it suffices 1950
[2:31:29] cleveland
[2:31:31] paragraph 43 jesus
[2:31:34] had all the fine qualities of god in him
[2:31:38] do you believe it are you hearing me
[2:31:41] do you believe it he had powers upon
[2:31:44] powers
[2:31:45] but when he met satan look look at this
[2:31:49] he never used his power
[2:31:57] he could have he could have said do you
[2:31:59] realize
[2:32:01] that just a few days ago in the jordan
[2:32:03] river
[2:32:04] god almighty came down over my head like
[2:32:07] a dove and spoke from heaven and said
[2:32:09] i'm i'm the beloved son and and uh he's
[2:32:12] dwelling in me
[2:32:13] how dare you come and bother me this way
[2:32:15] he could have used a lot of powers he
[2:32:17] could have made a lot of quotes he could
[2:32:18] have said a lot of things
[2:32:21] he could have used a lot of giftings he
[2:32:23] said he gave an example listen listen
[2:32:25] this is for you
[2:32:27] he gave an example for the weakest of
[2:32:29] christians
[2:32:32] don't raise your hand but are there any
[2:32:33] weak christians here
[2:32:39] we get that way when he met satan what'd
[2:32:42] he do
[2:32:44] he said it is written man shall not live
[2:32:47] by bread alone but by every word
[2:32:50] that proceedeth or proceeds out of the
[2:32:52] mouth of god
[2:32:53] the weakest christian can take that
[2:32:55] stand hold it
[2:32:57] hold it sure god's
[2:33:00] in his word now wait just a minute
[2:33:05] wait just a minute if god is
[2:33:08] in his word how valuable
[2:33:15] how worthy is his word
[2:33:22] how we treat the word
[2:33:27] it's how we treat god
[2:33:30] god is in his word oh yes that's not
[2:33:33] twisting
[2:33:36] that's taking the prophet for what he's
[2:33:38] saying to us
[2:33:40] he said every time when he would meet
[2:33:42] the enemy he said it is written
[2:33:44] he said i believe he had power to do it
[2:33:48] but he met satan on the same grounds
[2:33:51] whoa with the same word
[2:33:56] that you can meet him with
[2:33:59] he met satan with the same on the same
[2:34:03] grounds
[2:34:03] with the same word that you can meet him
[2:34:06] with
[2:34:07] everyone it's written
[2:34:11] it's written it
[2:34:14] is written it is written
[2:34:18] when you are weak and you can't pray in
[2:34:22] tongues
[2:34:24] when you are weak and you feel no power
[2:34:29] your giftings seem to escape you
[2:34:34] you still don't have to go down
[2:34:37] in defeat you still don't have to agree
[2:34:41] with depression you still don't have to
[2:34:45] agree
[2:34:46] with whatever it is that the enemy is
[2:34:47] using against you you
[2:34:49] have the same authority
[2:34:53] and the same weapon
[2:34:56] to stand on the same grounds and use the
[2:35:00] same word
[2:35:01] that jesus used against the enemy it is
[2:35:04] written would you stand
[2:35:08] lord i want to thank you for your word
[2:35:10] today
[2:35:12] i want to thank you that it's life
[2:35:16] hallelujah
[2:35:19] i want to thank you lord that you have
[2:35:21] given it to us
[2:35:23] in a way that we can understand it
[2:35:28] it may not seem as supernatural as a
[2:35:31] power
[2:35:32] or as a gifting but there is nothing
[2:35:35] more
[2:35:36] supernatural than taking up your word
[2:35:39] and using it to slay the enemy
[2:35:44] to pull the giant down f-a-i-t-h
[2:35:52] j-e-s-u-s
[2:35:59] we thank you today
[2:36:04] that you have gone before us our lord
[2:36:08] and shown us the way
[2:36:11] that we might also grow in grace
[2:36:16] from glory to glory strength to strength
[2:36:20] faith to faith that we might also
[2:36:24] grow in stature grow in wisdom
[2:36:30] those sons from before the foundation of
[2:36:32] the world
[2:36:34] we were first born as children even as
[2:36:37] you were our lord
[2:36:40] and then you became a given son
[2:36:43] one who had passed the test
[2:36:47] one who was celebrated by the
[2:36:49] declaration
[2:36:50] here he him
[2:36:55] and all heaven and earth had to listen
[2:36:59] to the authority
[2:37:00] with which he spoke the word
[2:37:05] your prophet told us that in the last
[2:37:07] days the voice of the resurrection
[2:37:11] would be in the bride
[2:37:14] she would echo the bridegroom's voice
[2:37:18] and in order for that to happen she will
[2:37:20] first have to be able to differentiate
[2:37:23] and distinguish between her voice and
[2:37:25] his
[2:37:28] by our own inner voices based on souls
[2:37:30] and emotion
[2:37:32] and your voice that's based on nothing
[2:37:34] but the word
[2:37:37] lord i want to thank you that you have
[2:37:39] made provision for the weakest
[2:37:44] christian
[2:37:46] causes hell to tremble
[2:37:49] when he or she gets down on their knees
[2:37:55] if the weakest christian can cause such
[2:37:58] a disturbance in hell
[2:38:00] oh god what can it do when mighty men
[2:38:04] and women of valor are raised up in
[2:38:06] your authority pulling out of weakness
[2:38:09] and into your strength

[2:50:51] maybe someone else has a need
[2:50:55] maybe some of you saints would come and
[2:50:59] pray with us that the lord will touch
[2:51:02] her
[2:51:05] i know that god is more than able she's
[2:51:07] been through a lot and he's brought her
[2:51:08] a long way
[2:51:10] she has much to be thankful for but she
[2:51:12] needs a victory today
[2:51:14] she needs a miracle today and she's come
[2:51:16] to the lord knowing
[2:51:18] that he is more than able and it was her
[2:51:21] desire to be prayed for today and we're
[2:51:23] going to do it
[2:51:24] with all the faith we can muster but we
[2:51:27] know that it's not a matter about
[2:51:29] getting our faith high enough it's a
[2:51:31] matter of just taking god at his word
[2:51:33] we're doing that
[2:51:34] we're just going to take him at his word
[2:51:36] today
[2:51:37] wherever you are in this room would you
[2:51:39] reach your hand of faith this way would
[2:51:41] you
[2:51:42] would you be with us would you be with
[2:51:44] us now not be talking or doing anything
[2:51:47] else
[2:51:49] would you spend just a moment in
[2:51:51] dedicated prayer and attention
[2:51:53] for our sister right now
[2:52:01] [Music]
[2:52:03] let your hand just be an extension of
[2:52:04] your faith just put it toward her
[2:52:08] god sees your faith he sees your faith
[2:52:11] right where you are
[2:52:13] right where you're standing there may be
[2:52:15] somebody streaming this service
[2:52:16] that's putting their faith in here for
[2:52:18] sister evelyn
[2:52:20] may not even know her lord i pray that
[2:52:24] the very
[2:52:25] same faith that they are stretching
[2:52:27] toward you on her behalf
[2:52:29] would return back to them and that they
[2:52:32] would see a miracle
[2:52:34] that they would see the meeting of their
[2:52:36] need lord
[2:52:38] i believe there's power when you have a
[2:52:40] need in praying for somebody else and
[2:52:43] using your faith on their behalf
[2:52:46] lord we anoint our sister in the mighty
[2:52:50] name of the lord jesus christ
[2:52:53] we stand here without one little ounce
[2:52:57] of doubt
[2:52:59] in who you are and what your ability is
[2:53:03] to heal to save to deliver
[2:53:07] to work miracles you are the same god
[2:53:11] who healed on the shore of galilee
[2:53:14] you're the same god that healed in the
[2:53:15] healing revival
[2:53:17] of the 50s and 60s you are jehovah rapha
[2:53:21] of the old testament
[2:53:23] the healing virtue is the same today
[2:53:26] as it flowed out of your body when the
[2:53:29] little woman touched you
[2:53:31] and the hem of your garment with her
[2:53:34] faith
[2:53:35] right now lord we stand
[2:53:39] believing confessing declaring
[2:53:43] your word of healing over this body
[2:53:47] father we know what her confession is
[2:53:50] we know what her faith says today
[2:53:53] and lord we're asking you for a turn
[2:53:56] around
[2:53:57] ha ha we're asking you lord to turn this
[2:54:00] thing around
[2:54:02] for your glory father i believe you
[2:54:05] would have her to be able
[2:54:06] to move without such awful pain
[2:54:10] lord have mercy would you tell me again
[2:54:14] what your
[2:54:15] surgery is and is it not related to this
[2:54:18] pain this is something else
[2:54:46] uh
[2:55:00] now
[2:55:05] and it's every night every night and
[2:55:07] when
[2:55:08] and when is your surgery scheduled
[2:55:13] all right would you just uh
[2:55:17] we're going to pray again she's uh
[2:55:20] has been scheduled for some time it's
[2:55:22] been changed a bit
[2:55:23] for a knee replacement but
[2:55:27] what is really going on is something
[2:55:30] in the respiratory like a choking and a
[2:55:34] heaviness or something that
[2:55:36] that affects your night and also in the
[2:55:38] daytime at times
[2:55:40] and has been since june now we know that
[2:55:43] the lord is able to go right into those
[2:55:45] lungs
[2:55:46] he is able i know he's able you believe
[2:55:50] it
[2:55:50] folks do you believe it church not that
[2:55:53] we had to know the detail but i just
[2:55:54] wanted to get it because i thought i was
[2:55:56] missing something
[2:55:58] now would you just reach your faith this
[2:55:59] way one more time
[2:56:01] and let's ask the lord to go right down
[2:56:03] into those lungs
[2:56:05] lord you're not only a repairer you're
[2:56:08] not
[2:56:08] only a healer but you're still a creator
[2:56:11] you didn't stop creating when you
[2:56:13] created the earth
[2:56:15] there is still creation power
[2:56:18] in your word and so lord it wouldn't
[2:56:21] take any extra
[2:56:23] effort to create and
[2:56:26] recreate with a creative miracle
[2:56:29] in those damaged lungs whatever
[2:56:33] it is that the enemy has desired
[2:56:37] to settle in i don't know what it is but
[2:56:41] it's as though he's come to settle there
[2:56:44] till the end
[2:56:45] but we just stand against it as a body
[2:56:48] of believers
[2:56:49] we stand against the assignment
[2:56:53] to heavy her lungs to affect her
[2:56:56] breathing
[2:56:58] we stand against the assignment to take
[2:57:01] her life
[2:57:03] it's like i could hear a spirit saying
[2:57:06] that he would just go there and stay
[2:57:09] but we cancel that in the authority of
[2:57:14] jesus christ we command you
[2:57:18] to take your hands off we know that the
[2:57:22] name of jesus and the blood of jesus
[2:57:27] and the word of almighty god are the
[2:57:30] weapons that we have been
[2:57:31] given to drive you out and to cancel
[2:57:36] your assignments
[2:57:38] [Music]
[2:57:51] we call for new tissue
[2:57:55] we call for new cells
[2:57:58] and new tissue to be formed in those
[2:58:02] lungs
[2:58:03] for the glory of god
[2:58:07] just go right ahead holy ghost and seal
[2:58:11] in what her faith is accomplishing right
[2:58:14] now
[2:58:16] oh
[2:58:18] [Music]
[2:58:30] oh the devil's a liar and the father of
[2:58:34] all
[2:58:35] lies he has no
[2:58:38] power and no authority
[2:58:42] to cut short our destiny days
[2:58:46] we expose him see what he does is he
[2:58:50] tries to wear us
[2:58:51] down until we give in
[2:58:55] to his lies throwing ourselves into the
[2:58:59] permissive will of god
[2:59:00] instead of into the perfect will of god
[2:59:02] because we agree
[2:59:04] with what he has to say we just say lord
[2:59:07] right now
[2:59:07] let such a faith arise
[2:59:11] let such a faith arise and sister evelyn
[2:59:13] today
[2:59:14] that there is no part of her that agrees
[2:59:17] with what the enemy has tried to speak
[2:59:19] over her life
[2:59:20] and over her body ishmael
[2:59:24] in fact i just want to take authority
[2:59:26] over some things that uh that doctors
[2:59:28] have spoken
[2:59:29] i see those in in in some authority at
[2:59:32] least
[2:59:33] authority you've given to them to speak
[2:59:36] i i want to believe god right now to
[2:59:39] cancel
[2:59:39] some of that because even some of that
[2:59:43] has you on a collision
[2:59:44] course and we just take that off in the
[2:59:47] name of jesus
[2:59:49] we're not talking about those who serve
[2:59:51] sin
[2:59:52] we're not talking about those who run
[2:59:54] down their life
[2:59:55] serving sin we're talking about the sons
[2:59:58] of god
[2:59:59] we're talking about the children of the
[3:00:01] most high god
[3:00:03] and we don't have to live by that same
[3:00:07] standard of degeneration
[3:00:10] we take you at your word lord i believe
[3:00:12] that everyone who would try to help
[3:00:14] would do all that they know to do and
[3:00:16] say all that they know to say
[3:00:17] but when it is contrary to god's truth
[3:00:20] we stand on the side of the word
[3:00:23] and we just say right now let every bit
[3:00:25] of that influence and the effect
[3:00:27] that it has had on the cells of this
[3:00:30] body
[3:00:31] be canceled in the name of jesus
[3:00:34] so that the healing virtue can now go
[3:00:38] into every one of those systems and
[3:00:40] cells and bring resurrection
[3:00:42] life
[3:00:51] would you praise the lord in here with
[3:00:53] me somebody
[3:00:54] how we should believe god
[3:00:58] anytime he helps us anytime he's willing
[3:01:01] to help us
[3:01:02] we ought to praise him when he helps
[3:01:05] somebody we love
[3:01:06] we ought to pray hallelujah
[3:01:16] and be held
[3:01:23] [Music]
[3:01:32] deep breaths
[3:01:36] [Music]
[3:01:45] there's something let me say this to you
[3:01:46] before you say something to me there's
[3:01:48] something at the top of your stomach
[3:01:52] i'm not sure exactly what it is but i
[3:01:55] think i can say that it's at the top
[3:01:57] of your stomach that's affecting you in
[3:01:59] some way
[3:02:01] i don't know exactly what that is
[3:02:03] because i know that a lot of the
[3:02:05] digestion takes place below the stomach
[3:02:07] but i saw something like a sore ulcer or
[3:02:10] something something look
[3:02:11] very very aggravated or something and i
[3:02:14] don't know what that has to do with
[3:02:16] anything you're going
[3:02:16] may not even be related to what what
[3:02:18] you've told me but i saw it
[3:02:20] just as clear as a bell so let's ask the
[3:02:23] lord to bring healing to that as well
[3:02:25] father i wished i knew exactly
[3:02:29] what to call it but what would it matter

[3:02:36] as i could see something that and i know
[3:02:40] you know what it is
[3:02:42] white and looked
[3:02:46] what i would say like around
[3:02:51] i
[3:02:54] around that two but it's below the
[3:02:58] esophagus
[3:02:59] lower than that lord you're the healer
[3:03:03] i don't know why you choose to show
[3:03:05] something like that but

[3:03:58] promise

[3:06:59] now i've known sister evelyn for
[3:07:03] 30 years or more
[3:07:07] and there's something about her faith
[3:07:09] that activates the gift
[3:07:11] every time it's coming with the
[3:07:14] determination
[3:07:16] not to hear something but to have
[3:07:18] something
[3:07:19] how can you not how can you not stir up
[3:07:22] what's present when you come with that
[3:07:25] kind of an expectation
[3:07:28] it's mine and she said as she was
[3:07:30] standing here
[3:07:31] what's really stirred her heart in this
[3:07:33] service was
[3:07:34] that line the creator died
[3:07:38] for his creation
[3:07:43] yes sir do you know an inventor
[3:07:47] who would die for what they invented
[3:07:49] only our creator would die for his
[3:07:52] creation
[3:07:53] isn't he wonderful and worthy amen let's
[3:07:56] stand together
[3:07:57] be dismissed thank you for all every one
[3:08:00] of you that put your faith in here
[3:08:03] even those of you who are at your seat
[3:08:04] and those of you who were there would
[3:08:07] you continue to remember
[3:08:08] sister davies in south
[3:08:12] africa that god would give her
[3:08:13] deliverance from her
[3:08:15] awful headaches and for our brother in
[3:08:19] pakistan whose little
[3:08:20] daughter cherith rose would see her
[3:08:23] victory whatever is going on she
[3:08:26] was such a beautiful little girl but she
[3:08:28] looks so sick
[3:08:30] and how that reaches to your heart and
[3:08:33] he is serving the lord in pakistan
[3:08:36] with a church and i know that god is
[3:08:39] able to move
[3:08:40] would you remember the family of of
[3:08:44] sister
[3:08:45] tebow's niece crystal
[3:08:48] who was i don't know
[3:08:52] miraculously spared at at some point to
[3:08:55] be able to
[3:08:56] come home and even communicate with her
[3:08:58] family for a short period of time
[3:09:01] so many didn't have that opportunity
[3:09:03] with their loved ones who went that way
[3:09:06] but after being how long in in
[3:09:09] on the ventilator how long was she
[3:09:13] almost two months and was able to get
[3:09:17] strong enough to come home and then the
[3:09:19] depression
[3:09:21] would settle on her of not being able to
[3:09:24] have the same quality of life and just
[3:09:28] when they were beginning to see some
[3:09:29] improvement there and getting her beyond
[3:09:31] that
[3:09:32] she suffered all i'm sure all related to
[3:09:35] what was going on in her body
[3:09:37] two strokes and the strokes
[3:09:40] left her so brain damaged that when the
[3:09:43] artificial assistance
[3:09:45] was was turned off there was no life
[3:09:48] left and deborah his sister
[3:09:52] tebow's sister who was living with her
[3:09:55] there for a while and came
[3:09:57] several times to service and she's
[3:10:01] lost a daughter 40 how old
[3:10:05] 43 years old and a husband who's older
[3:10:09] and not in good health and children and
[3:10:12] grandchildren who
[3:10:14] some have been here we want to continue
[3:10:17] to remember that family
[3:10:19] when is there a service for her a
[3:10:22] service tuesday for her in in florida
