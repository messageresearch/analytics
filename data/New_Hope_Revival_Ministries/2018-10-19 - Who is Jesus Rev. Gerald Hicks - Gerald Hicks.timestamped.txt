[1:02] Shelley from New Hope revival ministries
[1:05] in Smith Station Alabama and I'm coming
[1:08] to you today in partnership with brother
[1:11] Eric Erickson and all the fine folks at
[1:14] the gospel channel I don't know about
[1:16] you but I'm very thankful to God for the
[1:19] gospel channel and the work that they're
[1:22] doing all across Europe UK Scandinavia
[1:27] Iceland and I'm sure that most of you
[1:30] know that you can go online and visit
[1:33] the website and stream three different
[1:37] feeds from the gospel Channel the
[1:39] icelandic the Scandinavian and the
[1:42] European and you can stream that just
[1:45] about in every nation of the world and
[1:47] so I'm thankful for what God is doing
[1:50] I've been going back and forth to
[1:52] Iceland for many years now and I'm very
[1:55] impressed with the sincerity and the
[1:58] humility brother Ericsson and his
[2:01] dedication and if you've never heard the
[2:05] story of the gospel channel you need to
[2:07] do that there's a book and the testimony
[2:10] of the gospel channel is shared in that
[2:13] book and you'll see that God has chosen
[2:15] the little island of Iceland to play a
[2:19] very important role in the endtime and
[2:23] I'm blessed because we get to be a part
[2:25] of that I'm here today again with our
[2:29] good friend evangelist brother Gerald
[2:32] Hicks and he was with us some time back
[2:36] and shared his testimony and then we
[2:38] just recently did a program with him
[2:41] where he was so anointed with hope he so
[2:47] encouraged us and I know that you were
[2:51] encouraged let me remind you that you
[2:54] can reach out to the ministry here with
[2:56] your prayer request there's a prayer
[2:58] line number that you can call the email
[3:01] address is given if you if you've missed
[3:04] a program and you'd like to go back and
[3:06] catch up you can do that
[3:08] searching for our channel on YouTube and
[3:11] our website revival dot o-r-g is full of
[3:16] resources and information that I know
[3:19] will be a blessing to you and what I'm
[3:22] going to do today is I'm here as a host
[3:25] but I'm going to just let Brother Hicks
[3:29] speak to the camera because we know that
[3:33] on the other side of this camera there
[3:36] are people who love the Lord and who are
[3:39] hungry who have needs who need to be
[3:42] encouraged we know that there are people
[3:45] who don't yet know the Lord and I want
[3:48] you to be able to experience the
[3:51] ministry that God has given our brother
[3:54] he shared with us the last time we were
[3:56] together here that after hearing him
[3:59] preach a young man came up and he had
[4:02] his own ideas about what kind of a
[4:05] background brother Hicks must surely
[4:07] have to be able to have the ministry the
[4:11] foundation of truth that he has today he
[4:14] said you must have come from a very fine
[4:16] family and great Christian parents
[4:19] raising you in the church etc etc and
[4:22] brother Hicks let him know nothing could
[4:24] be farther from the truth but that's
[4:27] what makes this testimony and his life
[4:30] and ministry such a blessing is to know
[4:33] that there were many many odds against
[4:36] him but God was for him God had a
[4:39] purpose God had a plan before he was
[4:42] ever born
[4:43] and I want you to know it's not just
[4:46] that way for brother Gerald Hicks God
[4:48] has a plan for your life as well and
[4:50] he's waiting on you to surrender to him
[4:53] brother Hicks was preaching to us the
[4:56] other night about the difference between
[4:58] having a head experienced head knowledge
[5:00] and having heart knowledge I used to
[5:04] have a dear friend who would be
[5:05] preaching on that and he would say when
[5:07] it drops from your head to your heart to
[5:10] your hands when that knowledge that
[5:13] you've got in your head becomes a
[5:14] revelation in your heart then you start
[5:17] living it out with
[5:18] your hands and walking it out with your
[5:20] feet nothing could be any more true than
[5:23] those words so I'm just going to invite
[5:26] you brother Hicks to just take off and
[5:29] when I when I need to slow you down to
[5:31] pray we'll do that
[5:33] but until then would you take your
[5:35] liberty I feel honored to have you
[5:37] Pastor Shelly what an honor today to be
[5:40] with you what an honor to be able to
[5:42] share the word of the Lord today I was
[5:45] thinking about the passage of Scripture
[5:47] that's found in Matthew chapter 16
[5:50] beginning with verse 13 when Jesus came
[5:54] into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi he
[5:56] asked his disciples saying whom do men
[6:00] say that I the Son of Man am when he
[6:06] asked this - this question the disciples
[6:09] were so quick and ready to respond they
[6:13] immediately began to respond some say
[6:17] that thou art John the Baptist and some
[6:20] Elias others Jeremias or one of the
[6:23] prophets they quickly responded to the
[6:27] Lord Jesus because everywhere they went
[6:32] somebody was talking about who they
[6:35] thought he was and so they quickly
[6:38] responded some say you're John the
[6:41] Baptist some say you're Elijah
[6:44] some say you're Jeremiah others say
[6:47] you're one of the prophets but then he
[6:49] looked at these twelve men that he had
[6:52] hand-picked from every social and
[6:54] political plane in life and he asked
[6:57] them but whom say ye that I am at this
[7:03] moment the same twelve disciples who
[7:08] just moments before or so quick and so
[7:12] ready to respond and tell him yes sir
[7:17] who others say he is now they were
[7:20] completely speechless
[7:23] a few moments ago
[7:25] they could tell Jesus who the scribe who
[7:29] the Jew who the Pharisee who the bond
[7:33] who the free who the rich of the poor
[7:35] the young the old the male or the female
[7:38] thought he was and now that Jesus looks
[7:42] at them and asked them this very
[7:45] personal pointed question yes but whom
[7:49] say ye that I am all of a sudden these
[7:53] twelve disciples are completely
[7:56] speechless they're silent they don't
[8:00] really know exactly what to say they
[8:03] don't really know exactly how to respond
[8:05] but I can imagine that the wheels of
[8:08] their mind must be turning at this
[8:11] moment and each of them must be
[8:14] wondering in his own mind just exactly
[8:18] who is he hmm they had watched him open
[8:23] the eyes of the blind that watched him
[8:25] unstopped the ears of the Deaf they had
[8:28] watched him turn water into wine at a
[8:31] wedding feast in Cana of Galilee they
[8:35] had watched him feed multitudes with
[8:37] just a few loaves and fish they had
[8:42] stood by the roadside and witnessed as
[8:44] he raised the dead to life again
[8:49] and now they are trying to contemplate
[8:52] in their own mind just exactly who is he
[8:57] and all of a sudden it was Simon Peter
[8:59] who opened his mouth and declared with
[9:03] great boldness according to verse 16
[9:06] thou art the Christ the Son of the
[9:11] Living God thou art the anointed one
[9:15] right a man thou art the Christ the
[9:18] Anointed One the Son of the Living God
[9:22] and jesus answered and said unto him
[9:25] blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh
[9:31] and
[9:32] blood hath not revealed it unto thee but
[9:36] my father which is in heaven and I say
[9:38] also unto thee that thou art Peter and
[9:41] upon this rock I will build my church
[9:46] and the gates of Hell shall not prevail
[9:51] against it now will give unto thee the
[9:54] keys of the kingdom of heaven yes and
[9:58] whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
[10:00] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[10:03] thou shalt loose on earth shall be
[10:07] loosed in heaven
[10:09] immediately when Simon Peter declared
[10:13] thou art the Christ the Anointed One the
[10:18] son of the Living God Jesus declared
[10:23] blessed art thou simon Jonah Amen I
[10:28] think today that the real way for you
[10:33] and I and many many others to become
[10:36] blessed is to find out who Jesus Christ
[10:40] really is there are multitudes of people
[10:45] who are searching in every direction
[10:49] they are going up and down back in here
[10:53] with to and fro all throughout the earth
[10:56] and they are searching they're looking
[11:00] why because there's something deep
[11:03] inside that truly longs to be blessed
[11:07] and according to the Word of God
[11:09] according to this passage that blessing
[11:13] begins in your life and mind when we
[11:16] discover who Jesus Christ really is that
[11:21] he is the Anointed One the Son of the
[11:26] Living God see it's at this moment that
[11:29] the scales of spiritual blindness fell
[11:34] from the eyes of Simon Peter and he
[11:37] boldly declared without fear without
[11:41] embarrassment without trepidation
[11:43] thou art the crime right yes sir and
[11:47] Jesus immediately lets Simon Peter know
[11:51] that flesh and blood has not revealed
[11:55] this unto thee if you know who Jesus is
[11:59] today
[12:00] flesh and blood does not reveal to you
[12:04] who Jesus Christ truly is if you know
[12:09] him to be the Christ the Anointed One
[12:13] the Son of the Living God it's not flesh
[12:17] and blood that reveals that unto you but
[12:21] it is the mercy of God it is the grace
[12:25] of God that allows the scales of
[12:28] spiritual blindness to fall from our
[12:31] eyes and gives us a divine understanding
[12:35] that he's more than just a baby
[12:39] that was born in a manger wrapped in
[12:43] swaddling clothes that he's more than
[12:45] just Mary's little boy he's more than
[12:49] Joseph's son he's more than a lowly
[12:52] Galilee anomaly he's more than just the
[12:55] son of a carpenter in Nazareth but that
[12:59] he is indeed without a factor the son of
[13:04] the Living God yes sir
[13:06] amen and so it is that flesh and blood
[13:10] does not reveal this it has to be
[13:13] revealed to us and by the spirit
[13:16] and Jesus said when you receive this
[13:20] understanding when you receive this
[13:23] revelation I'm going to give you keys to
[13:27] the kingdom mama and whatever you bind
[13:30] on earth is going to be bound in heaven
[13:33] and whatever you loose on earth is going
[13:36] to be loosed in heaven how very
[13:39] important it is for you and I to
[13:42] discover for ourselves who Jesus Christ
[13:47] really is you know it's it's amazing to
[13:51] me that there are tens of thousands of
[13:55] people who attend church on a weekly
[13:58] basis and they do not know who Jesus
[14:02] Christ is right really is my it astounds
[14:06] me it staggers my mind at the vast
[14:10] multitude of people in our world today
[14:13] who truly does not have a clue in this
[14:18] world who Jesus Christ really is they do
[14:22] have some head knowledge they've read
[14:25] some scripture and they've listened to
[14:28] some sermons and they've looked through
[14:30] some books and they've done some
[14:32] research over the internet and all of
[14:35] that's good and all of that has its
[14:37] place but today as individuals of if we
[14:42] are going to leave a lasting impression
[14:45] on the generation in which we live if we
[14:49] are going to change the world in which
[14:51] we're a part of we must have much much
[14:55] more than just head knowledge of what we
[14:59] truly need is some heart knowledge head
[15:02] knowledge may tell me a little about him
[15:05] but when I get heart knowledge I'm gonna
[15:09] be fully introduced to him that's right
[15:12] and so it is that Jesus setup on this
[15:15] rock
[15:17] upon this divine revelation yes sir what
[15:21] was the revelation the revelation was
[15:23] thou art the Christ the Son of the
[15:28] Living God Jesus setup only this
[15:32] revelation I am going to build my church
[15:37] salut yeah hallelujah this church that
[15:40] you and I are part of this body that we
[15:43] are members of has been built upon the
[15:47] revelation of Jesus Christ it has been
[15:51] built on the revelation of the mighty
[15:55] God in Christ amen hallelujah and I am
[15:59] so thankful today that I have a I have a
[16:03] real understanding not but because of
[16:07] flesh and not because lessor it's not
[16:10] because of intelligence not because of
[16:13] intellect but I have a divine
[16:15] understanding because he has decided to
[16:19] allow his mercy to come into my life but
[16:22] in thinking about head knowledge verses
[16:25] heart knowledge I remember a story that
[16:29] I heard quite a number of years ago and
[16:32] it so impacted me when I heard it and I
[16:36] have remembered it all these years it
[16:38] was about a young man that at the age of
[16:41] 18 years old living in what you and I
[16:44] would call the Bible Belt on the eastern
[16:48] seaboard in the United States of America
[16:50] a young man at 18 years old who had
[16:54] never heard the name Jesus a young man
[16:58] at 18 years old that had never seen the
[17:02] inside or the outside of a church a
[17:05] young man at 18 years old that had never
[17:08] heard a gospel song imagine pastor
[17:13] Shelley you and I probably cannot even
[17:16] remember how old we were when we heard
[17:19] our first gospel song we were so young
[17:22] we probably cannot even remember the
[17:25] first time we heard the name Jesus
[17:29] because we were so young we probably
[17:32] cannot even remember our first trips to
[17:36] the house of God because we've been
[17:38] attending church virtually all of our
[17:42] life and sometimes if we're not careful
[17:45] we tend to take that for granted it's so
[17:48] true and when we tend to take it for
[17:50] granted we lose yes our appreciation for
[17:53] it is the truth but oh God helped me to
[17:56] dance Lord not to ever lose my love and
[17:59] my appreciation for the house of God and
[18:03] for the things of God and for the work
[18:06] of the ministry especially but this
[18:09] young man had never heard the name Jesus
[18:11] the story has it that his father was not
[18:15] an atheist he did believe in a Supreme
[18:18] Being somewhere but he was a professing
[18:22] agnostic he would tell people that he
[18:25] absolutely hated God that he hated the
[18:30] name Jesus I cannot even imagine someone
[18:35] hating the name Jesus I think about how
[18:39] wonderful that name yes I think about
[18:42] how sweet and how life-changing that
[18:45] name is and I cannot even imagine that
[18:50] somebody could hate the name Jesus but
[18:55] this man would literally declare two
[18:58] people that he hated the main Jesus and
[19:01] when his son was born he made a vow that
[19:05] he would raise that son to never hear
[19:09] the name Jesus he made a vow that with
[19:14] everything that was in him if at all
[19:17] possible he would keep that young man
[19:19] away from God and away from the house of
[19:23] God and for 18 years he was successful
[19:27] at doing that 18 years that young man
[19:31] lived in a free country that is filled
[19:35] with the gospel from seaboard to
[19:38] seaboard and had never heard the name
[19:42] Jesus yes and now at 18 years old his
[19:47] father goes to the west coast and while
[19:50] his father is gone this young man comes
[19:53] in contact with a new employ that is
[19:57] working around the home as a gardener
[20:00] and the young man the first day he saw
[20:03] this gardener he wasn't all that
[20:06] fascinated at first but the longer he
[20:09] watched the gardener the more fascinated
[20:12] he became he really couldn't explain it
[20:14] he couldn't put his finger on it but
[20:17] there was just something about this
[20:20] gardener the more he watched him the
[20:23] more intrigued he was to watch him and
[20:27] he noticed that every once in a while
[20:29] the gardener would stop taking his hand
[20:33] and wipe the sweat from his brow and he
[20:36] would take his hand and wave like he was
[20:38] waving at somebody but the young man
[20:40] thought in his mind who in the world
[20:43] could he be waving at the more he
[20:46] watched the gardener the closer he got
[20:49] to the house he noticed that not only
[20:51] would he take his hand and wipe the
[20:54] sweat from his brow not only would he
[20:56] look up and wave like it was waving at
[20:59] somebody but he even watched it it
[21:02] seemed like his lips were moving like he
[21:05] was talking to somebody but who in the
[21:08] world could he be talking to it wasn't
[21:11] very long the gardener happened to
[21:13] notice that the young man was watching
[21:16] him push the lawn mower back and forth
[21:19] back and forth and so he finally decided
[21:23] to stop
[21:24] walked over to where the young man was
[21:26] looking through the glass door motion
[21:29] for the young man to open the door and
[21:31] when the young man pulled the door open
[21:33] just a little darkness that excuse me
[21:36] young man
[21:37] may I have five minutes of your time the
[21:41] young man looked at the gardener and
[21:43] said sir
[21:44] why on earth would you want five minutes
[21:47] of my time the gardener said I would
[21:51] like to tell you the greatest story
[21:54] that's ever been told I am I the young
[21:58] man thought for a moment I have been
[22:00] educated by the finest teachers
[22:04] professors and scholars in all of the
[22:08] world at a very very great expense to my
[22:12] father and you appear to be just a
[22:17] normal average ordinary individual how
[22:21] in the world could you possibly tell me
[22:25] the greatest story that's ever been told
[22:28] by man the gardener looked at the young
[22:30] man and said I would like to tell you
[22:33] the story of Jesus hi at this moment
[22:37] there were question marks in the eyes of
[22:41] the young man he looked into the face of
[22:43] the gardener and he said who in the
[22:46] world is Jesus I've never heard that
[22:51] name before
[22:52] the gardener said would you give me just
[22:56] five minutes and let me tell you the
[22:59] story of Jesus the young man opened the
[23:03] door invited the gardener in it would
[23:07] not be five minutes but it would be
[23:09] somewhere like five hours I really don't
[23:13] know where the gardener started I really
[23:16] don't know where he ended up but I do
[23:18] know that at his conclusion that young
[23:22] boy 18 years old who had never heard the
[23:26] name Jesus
[23:29] found himself down on his knees with
[23:32] trembling hands raised in the air with
[23:36] hot tears streaming down his face and as
[23:40] he began to call on the name of Jesus
[23:43] Christ for the very first time heaven
[23:48] came down and glory filled his soul and
[23:52] that young man began to speak in a
[23:55] heavenly language as the spirit in him
[24:00] the utterance and little did he know at
[24:03] that moment that his life would be
[24:06] changed for time and eternity they tell
[24:12] me that for the next several days
[24:15] that young boy spent the most part of
[24:18] every day down on his knees with
[24:23] trembling hands in the air with hot
[24:26] tears streaming down his face calling on
[24:29] the name of Jesus and speaking in a
[24:33] heavenly language as the Spirit of God
[24:36] gave him the other area the day his
[24:40] father finally arrived back at home from
[24:43] the west coast he was anxious to see his
[24:46] son and so he quickly inquired about
[24:50] where his son was at and started to make
[24:54] his way to the room where his son was at
[24:57] and when he climbed the stairs and
[24:59] started down the hallway about halfway
[25:02] down the hallway he could hear the
[25:05] muffled echo of his son's voice coming
[25:09] from behind the door and as he drew
[25:12] close to the door he began to realize
[25:15] that there was an uncertain sound coming
[25:19] from behind the door when he finally
[25:22] opened the door to his shock and great
[25:25] surprise he found his son down on knees
[25:29] that were bent with trembling hands up
[25:33] in the air with hot tears streaming down
[25:36] his face calling
[25:39] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that
[25:43] father was so angry that he ran across
[25:46] the room he jerked that son up off of
[25:49] his bended knees I pushed him up against
[25:52] the wall and began to shake him
[25:55] violently all the while he shouted over
[25:59] and over at the top of his voice what's
[26:03] happened to you what's happened to you
[26:06] who has done this to you when that young
[26:10] boy was finally able to respond he
[26:14] looked at his daddy and said I know
[26:18] Jesus and I have been filled with the
[26:22] Holy Ghost that father was so angry he
[26:27] left the room and slammed the door
[26:30] behind him in just a little while he
[26:34] would find himself in his office on the
[26:37] telephone in separate conversations with
[26:42] two of the most noted and talented brain
[26:47] surgeons in all of the world and in
[26:50] different conversations he asked those
[26:54] surgeons to perform a very delicate
[26:58] operation on his son what he literally
[27:02] wanted those surgeons to do was he
[27:06] wanted them to perform a frontal
[27:08] lobotomy where they would go in above
[27:11] his left eye in a very delicate
[27:14] procedure and erase or remove his memory
[27:19] bank in a very delicate procedure they
[27:22] could erase everything that's ever been
[27:26] stored in a person's memory the two
[27:30] surgeons explained to the father the
[27:33] seriousness of this procedure and said
[27:36] don't you understand that everything
[27:39] that your son has ever learned
[27:42] everything that he's ever stored in his
[27:46] memory will
[27:48] has to be learned all over again that
[27:53] father said it will be worth it if you
[27:57] can get Jesus and the Holy Ghost out of
[28:02] his mind
[28:02] my-my-my so against the young boys wheel
[28:07] they took that boy to another country
[28:11] and they performed this operation and
[28:15] that surgeons guaranteed the father that
[28:20] it was absolutely medically impossible
[28:23] for that young boy to remember anything
[28:27] and they tell me that for nearly two
[28:31] weeks after the operation that young boy
[28:35] sat in a hospital bed in a room with a
[28:39] blank stare on his face every waking
[28:43] moment they said there was absolutely no
[28:47] physical no verbal response of any kind
[28:52] for two weeks and finally one day they
[28:55] walked in and said that eighteen year
[28:58] old boy was sitting up in the hospital
[29:00] bed holding up two fingers and they did
[29:04] not understand that and said they would
[29:06] go over and try to put his hand down and
[29:09] he would raise it right back up they try
[29:11] to put his hand down and he would raise
[29:13] it right back up and after doing that
[29:16] for several days they walked in one day
[29:19] and they were going to do a routine
[29:22] examination and before they started
[29:26] their routine examination this young boy
[29:29] 18 years old who has not spoken a word
[29:33] in over two weeks since the operation in
[29:37] a very slurred voice like a child just
[29:42] learning how to speak that 18 year old
[29:45] boy said I know Jesus and I've been
[29:50] filled with the Holy Ghost that father
[29:54] could not believe this he
[29:57] hated the name Jesus in such a way that
[30:01] he would take that young man and he
[30:04] would put him in a padded cell in a
[30:07] straitjacket and they would perform one
[30:10] horrible procedure after another on this
[30:14] young man and doctors and specialists
[30:18] said he should he should be ignorant he
[30:22] should be a vegetable he should never be
[30:25] able to function normally in society he
[30:28] shouldn't be able to talk he shouldn't
[30:31] be able to read he shouldn't be able to
[30:33] remember or comprehend anything
[30:36] however after everything they put that
[30:40] young boy through if he could not speak
[30:43] if he had no voice to speak with he
[30:47] could pick up a crayon like a child and
[30:50] walk over and write on the side of the
[30:53] wall I know Jesus and I've been filled
[30:58] with the Holy Ghost somebody said well
[31:01] exactly what happened what happened is
[31:04] this the young boy did not have hit
[31:09] knowledge but the young boy had heart
[31:12] knowledge of that see when we have hip
[31:15] knowledge yes sir sometimes people can
[31:18] erase it for Laurier's but if we ever
[31:21] get heart knowledge nobody will ever be
[31:25] able to erase it and the table of the
[31:29] heart
[31:29] no wonder David said I hid the word and
[31:35] we're in the heart not on the tables of
[31:39] my minds but he said I hid the word in
[31:43] my heart that I might not sin against
[31:48] thee amen David understood I have to
[31:52] have the Word of God yes sir not just in
[31:55] my mind
[31:56] not just in my memory but I need to
[32:00] write it down on the tables of my heart
[32:05] why is that because the Bible said from
[32:09] the abundance of what the heart the
[32:14] mouth is going to speak hallelujah the
[32:17] mouth does not speak what is in the mind
[32:21] the mouth speaks what's in the heart
[32:25] hallelujah that is why it is so very
[32:29] important for us to get the gospel of
[32:33] the message of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[32:37] words of eternal life not just in our
[32:41] mind not just in our memory not just in
[32:46] our head but all today we need to get
[32:51] the Word of God written on the tables of
[32:55] our heart
[32:56] hallelujah why because when we get it
[32:59] written down it is on the tables of our
[33:02] heart health there is nothing and there
[33:05] is no body that will ever be able to
[33:10] erase it hallelujah if it's only written
[33:14] they own up on the tables of the mind
[33:16] the right amount of temptation right the
[33:19] right amount of glitter the right amount
[33:22] of glamour the right amount of fortune
[33:25] or fame the right amount of pain or
[33:28] trouble or difficulty may cause you to
[33:32] forget about it I remember as a young
[33:34] man they told me when I first profess
[33:38] Christ as my Lord and Savior my very
[33:42] dearest friends told me you'll outgrow
[33:45] that oh my you'll get tired of that
[33:48] you'll get bored with that some of my
[33:51] dearest friends told me I tried that
[33:54] once just like you and it'll get old but
[33:58] did you know pastor Shelly a three and a
[34:01] half
[34:01] decades 35 years later I love him more
[34:06] today than I've ever loved him and man
[34:09] the experience that I have is more real
[34:13] and it is more alive in my heart and in
[34:18] my spirit and in my life today than it's
[34:21] ever being why but I did not just get an
[34:25] experience in my hell that's right but
[34:28] thank God more importantly I got an
[34:31] experience in my heart hallelujah yes
[34:35] and that's exactly what God wants today
[34:39] for every individual who's hearing our
[34:43] voice who's watching this broadcast God
[34:47] wants you to have lawyers just ahead
[34:50] knowledge he wants you to have more than
[34:53] just an understanding in your
[34:56] intelligence but God wants you to have a
[35:00] divine supernatural experience alone in
[35:04] your heart
[35:06] hallelujah why because when you have a
[35:09] supernatural experience in your heart it
[35:13] will change the way you live it will
[35:16] change the way you talk it will change
[35:19] the way you walk it will put a smile on
[35:22] your face it'll put a sparkle in your
[35:25] eye it'll put a spring in your step
[35:28] it'll put a song in your heart
[35:31] s-sir it will give you hope passion and
[35:35] determination that you've never had in
[35:38] all of your life that's right and so I
[35:40] challenge people everywhere that I go to
[35:43] please do more than just get an
[35:47] experience in your mind but please get
[35:52] an experience in your heart oh yes the
[35:54] young man did not just get some head
[35:58] knowledge but he got some heart not

[50:28] I am has a name okay
[50:31] hallelujah if we go through the 400
[50:35] years of darkness in Matthew he was a
[50:38] kingly Messiah in mark he was a Wonder
[50:41] worker in Luke he was a friend of
[50:44] sinners and outcasts but John had an
[50:47] experience with the Lord Jesus Christ
[50:51] the other disciples did not have and
[50:54] therefore when he began his book he
[50:58] began by saying in the beginning was the
[51:01] word and the Word was with God and the
[51:05] Word was God and the same was in the
[51:08] beginning with God all things were made
[51:11] by him and without him was not anything
[51:14] made that was made in him was life and
[51:18] the life was the light of man the light
[51:21] shine ahthe and darkness and the
[51:23] darkness comprehended it not the Bible
[51:26] said that he came unto his own and his
[51:29] own received him not
[51:30] but as many as received him to them gave
[51:34] he power to become the sons of God even
[51:39] to them that believe on his name Lord I
[51:44] believe the writer said for God has
[51:47] highly exalted him
[51:49] yes sir and given him a name that is
[51:53] above every name
[51:55] all right that at the name of Jesus
[51:57] Christ every every knee should bow to
[52:00] things that are in heaven to things that
[52:03] are on the earth to things beneath the
[52:06] earth and that every tongue should
[52:08] confess that Jesus Christ is his Lord
[52:12] the writer said neither is there
[52:16] salvation in any other for there is none
[52:19] other name under heaven where
[52:22] given among men whereby that we must be
[52:27] saved now time won't allow me but I do
[52:30] quickly want to to go right to the last
[52:33] book of the Bible God spared a prophet
[52:36] from a pot of burning oil did marooned
[52:39] him on a deserted island and then let
[52:42] him eavesdrop on the coming eternity
[52:45] there so he could record the revelation
[52:48] of Jesus Christ which was with chills
[52:52] and which is his heaven the writer said
[52:55] I John who also am your brother and
[52:58] companion in tribulation and in the
[53:00] kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was
[53:03] in the isle that is called Patmos for
[53:06] the word of God and for the testimony of
[53:09] Jesus Christ
[53:10] I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day
[53:13] and heard behind me a great voice as of
[53:16] a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega
[53:19] the first and the last Lord what thou
[53:23] seest write a book and send it under the
[53:27] seven churches which are in Asia under
[53:30] emphasis under Smyrna Pergamum Thyatira
[53:34] Sardis Philadelphia and Laodicea and I
[53:38] turned to see the voice that spake with
[53:40] me and being turned I saw seven golden
[53:44] candlesticks and in the midst of the
[53:47] seven candlesticks one like unto the Son
[53:51] of Man clothed with a garment down to
[53:53] the foot Girt about the paps with a
[53:56] golden girdle his head and his hair were
[53:59] white like wool as white as snow his
