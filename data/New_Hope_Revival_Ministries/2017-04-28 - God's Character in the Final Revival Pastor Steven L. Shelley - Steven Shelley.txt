TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so what do you believe will be the sign of the last great move of God it will be a people who not only pray for the sick or speak words of healing and deliverance and have visions and and the gifts operate in their life but greater than that higher than that more effective than that more powerful than that and rarer than anything else that's ever happened in the church there will be a people who come forth to demonstrate this life and what is this life it is the character that's it it is the character and the attributes of Jesus Christ so will there be healing in Miracles yes but they're going to come in a different way than they have come in times past they're not just going to come by the anointing of oil and the laying on of hands they're going to come by the power of the spoken creative word because there's going to be a bride manifesting the attributes and the character of Jesus Christ so yes there's going to be healing and yes there's going to be Miracles when God begins to manifest himself it's going to be from within you that he moves he's going to move from within you to the outside and as he does that it's going to to be his character coming forth and so it's going to be all about integrity it's going to be all about truth it's not going to be about little perfect people born perfect it's going to be about people that have been through the water and they didn't drown and they' been through the fire and the fire couldn't burn them and they've climbed the mountain and slid down the other side and they've walked through the valleys of the Shadows of death and they have faced persecution and lies against who they were and what they believe and they have suffered many things and some of them have had their bodies twisted and mangled by pain and by heartache and by loss and by grief and by daddy issues and mother issues and rejection issues and insecurity issues and inferiority issues and disqualification issues and all that goes with living here in sa zeden and yet they're going to come through by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and the greatest demonstration of God's power hour it's going to be quick and it's going to be short and it's going to call in the last of the bride and it's going to release the final Harvest of souls that planet earth has seen
