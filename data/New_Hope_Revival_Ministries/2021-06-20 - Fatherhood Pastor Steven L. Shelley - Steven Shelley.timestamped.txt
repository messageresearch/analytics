[0:00] out freely psalm 128
[0:03] verse 1 blessed is everyone
[0:07] that feareth the lord that
[0:11] walketh in his ways
[0:14] this is how you know someone fears the
[0:16] lord
[0:17] because they're walking in his ways
[0:20] for thou shalt eat the labor of thine
[0:24] hands
[0:25] happy shalt thou be and it shall be well
[0:30] with thee how many of you like to claim
[0:32] that as a personal promise
[0:35] thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine
[0:38] by the sides of thine house thy children
[0:42] like
[0:42] olive plants round about thy table
[0:46] behold that thus shall the man be
[0:49] blessed
[0:50] that feareth the lord the lord
[0:53] shall bless thee out of zion
[0:56] and thou shalt see the good of jerusalem
[1:01] all the days of thy life yea
[1:04] thou shall see thy children's
[1:07] children how many of you'd like to see
[1:10] your children's
[1:11] children you'd like to see them serving
[1:14] the lord
[1:15] and peace upon israel
[1:19] i want you to know that's a power-packed
[1:21] six verses
[1:22] of blessing and it all is addressed
[1:26] to the man that fears the lord
[1:30] and we can claim many of those promises
[1:33] for the women
[1:34] who fear the lord as well but this was
[1:37] directed toward a man
[1:39] that will fear the lord
[1:42] i want to read while you're standing
[1:44] three more verses
[1:46] if you'll turn to ephesians chapter six
[1:50] i'd like to read the first three verses
[1:53] of ephesians chapter six and then i'm
[1:56] going to bring to you
[1:58] our father's day message for this year
[2:02] it starts off and i like it real good
[2:05] i'm real pleased with the way this
[2:07] starts off children
[2:10] may i add teenagers
[2:13] may i add young adults obey your parents
[2:17] in the lord for this is right
[2:20] notice paul says in the lord
[2:25] you know they might not be in the lord
[2:26] they might ask you to rob a bank
[2:29] you're not supposed to do such a thing
[2:31] as that but if you've got parents in the
[2:33] lord
[2:34] you should obey them that's the word of
[2:37] god
[2:38] honor thy father and mother
[2:42] i like it it says which is the first
[2:46] commandment
[2:47] with promise there's no mention here of
[2:51] if they're worthy of it
[2:53] it just says to honor them
[2:56] you might have to be creative to honor
[3:00] your father or your mother on this earth
[3:02] but god help you and strengthen you to
[3:04] be that creative
[3:05] to be able to do that that it may be
[3:08] well with thee
[3:10] and thou mayest live long on the earth
[3:14] and ye fathers provoke not your
[3:17] children to wrath but bring them up
[3:20] in the nurture and admonition
[3:24] of the lord how many of you believe
[3:27] that's really good advice
[3:29] would you just pray with me now lord
[3:31] jesus i thank you for the strength and
[3:34] the health
[3:35] and the desire to be in your house today
[3:39] i'm a very thankful father for the first
[3:42] time in over 10 days
[3:44] i can say by your grace that we have
[3:47] all of our children at home with us safe
[3:51] from a long journey we know lord it was
[3:54] your grace that
[3:55] brought them in even as benjamin flew in
[3:58] last night nearly 11 o'clock
[4:00] i'm so thankful that you brought them
[4:02] safely home
[4:04] it just makes my father's day a whole
[4:06] lot more special
[4:08] lord we ask today that you speak to us
[4:11] from your word
[4:13] you've made many promises for a man who
[4:16] seeks to please you
[4:17] who desires to walk upright before you
[4:21] you've promised blessing and provision
[4:24] you have given many of us the great
[4:26] responsibility
[4:28] it's also a blessing but it's a great
[4:31] responsibility
[4:33] to be a father to another life
[4:36] and so lord we need strength and we need
[4:39] help
[4:40] and we need encouragement and we need
[4:44] wisdom and lord we realize that even
[4:47] when they leave our home
[4:50] we are more limited in what we might
[4:53] invest
[4:54] but we also know that we're still needed
[4:57] so i pray lord that you would give
[5:00] daddies and granddaddies great wisdom
[5:02] today
[5:03] to know when to speak up to know when to
[5:07] to sow to know when
[5:10] they might add something even to their
[5:14] children and their families
[5:16] their grandchildren that are coming
[5:18] along
[5:19] it's a great ministry you've given us
[5:21] lord
[5:22] and i ask today that there be no
[5:25] condemnation in this word
[5:28] if there is any correction let it come
[5:30] from you
[5:31] if there's any encouragement let it come
[5:33] from you
[5:34] for lord we just stand before you as men
[5:38] who are flawed but as men who desire
[5:42] to be used by your hand we fear you
[5:45] because we know
[5:47] that you are who you say you are and
[5:50] you'll do what you say you will
[5:52] do and we want to cooperate with you in
[5:55] all things to raise our children
[5:58] in the fear of the lord give us that
[6:00] grace today anoint
[6:02] our ears to receive your word we ask for
[6:05] this blessing
[6:06] in the wonderful name of the lord jesus
[6:08] christ
[6:10] and we say amen and we ask the body the
[6:13] church to say
[6:15] so be it amen you may be seated
[6:18] it would not be my desire to add to
[6:21] anyone's grief
[6:23] as chad was praying today we know there
[6:26] are those who have lost their father
[6:29] and i have of course the last few days
[6:32] been thinking about my earthly father
[6:34] who
[6:35] passed away this year it
[6:39] it aches there's an ache there but as
[6:43] some of you also have experienced i lost
[6:46] him many years ago
[6:48] i placed him in god's hands many years
[6:51] ago
[6:51] and he's still in god's hands today
[6:54] but i know there are those who had real
[6:56] relationship
[6:58] with your father we thought about paul
[7:00] this week we spoke to him
[7:03] and let him know that we were thinking
[7:05] about him that we were praying for him
[7:07] that we would particularly be thinking
[7:09] about him today and his family
[7:12] as they gather together with his mom
[7:15] remembering
[7:17] the godly man that brother west was and
[7:19] how empty
[7:20] life can seem without him i wouldn't
[7:23] want to isolate those who have not had
[7:25] the privilege
[7:27] of being a father some we can say yet
[7:32] and others we realize may never have
[7:35] that experience in this life
[7:38] but god knew all that when he wrote the
[7:40] book
[7:41] and he addressed fathers and he
[7:43] addressed mothers
[7:44] knowing that everyone would not be one
[7:47] but i can tell you that as a
[7:49] as a woman of god can be a spiritual
[7:53] mother or a midwife to spiritual
[7:56] children so can a father so can a man of
[8:00] god
[8:02] he may never experience the joy of
[8:04] natural children but he can pour his
[8:07] life
[8:08] into somebody else's life and i'll tell
[8:10] you we have plenty of teachers
[8:13] we have plenty of tutors we have lessons
[8:16] by the dozens
[8:17] but we have a few fathers and so there's
[8:20] just
[8:21] most of us could still use a father
[8:24] so if you would desire to sow into
[8:26] somebody's life
[8:28] i believe there will be great
[8:29] fulfillment in knowing that even though
[8:32] you may not be working with your
[8:33] biological children
[8:35] you are at least sowing truth and
[8:38] encouragement
[8:39] and strength and i know that i know that
[8:41] i know who i am
[8:43] i know what the word has said about me
[8:46] but i also know that as human beings we
[8:49] all
[8:49] need to be encouraged from time to time
[8:52] we need to know that we're not alone
[8:54] in this fight and so really all of us
[8:57] can serve
[8:58] an amazing purpose we can add value to
[9:01] somebody somewhere
[9:03] if we desire to do that i'm a blessed
[9:06] man
[9:07] before i ever got out of bed this
[9:09] morning i was getting messages from all
[9:11] over the world
[9:13] people saying happy father's day brother
[9:15] shelly
[9:16] you're a spiritual dad to me so i spent
[9:19] time this morning praying lord don't let
[9:21] me fail those children
[9:23] let me continue to be encouragement to
[9:26] them
[9:26] and even more so as we as we move
[9:29] toward the promises of god i want to
[9:32] read another portion of scripture
[9:34] maybe a lot of scripture this morning
[9:37] but i want to read something
[9:40] king david was about to go home he was
[9:43] about to slip away
[9:45] into the presence of his creator and he
[9:48] left a charge
[9:49] for his son solomon i don't know how
[9:51] long it's been
[9:52] since you read this portion of scripture
[9:55] but it's been a lot of help to me this
[9:57] week
[9:58] would you give us first kings chapter
[10:00] two
[10:01] the first four verses i like the
[10:04] blessings that are promised in psalms
[10:06] 128
[10:08] the first six verses i like the
[10:10] admonition that's given
[10:12] to children in ephesians six verses one
[10:16] through three
[10:17] but i am really appreciating this
[10:20] message this charge that david left
[10:23] behind
[10:24] now the days of david drew nigh that he
[10:27] should die
[10:29] and he charged solomon his son saying
[10:33] i go the way of all the earth be thou
[10:37] strong therefore and show thyself
[10:41] a man and keep the charge
[10:46] of the lord thy god to walk in his ways
[10:51] to keep his statutes and his
[10:54] commandments
[10:55] and his judgments and his testimonies as
[11:00] it is written
[11:01] in the law of moses that thou mayest
[11:05] prosper do you want to have prosperity
[11:08] in your life
[11:09] david said solomon you want to always
[11:12] prosper
[11:13] then i want to charge you i want to
[11:16] charge you and encourage you to follow
[11:19] the lord
[11:20] walk in his ways keep his statutes
[11:23] keep his commandments keep his judgments
[11:26] keep his testimonies as it is written in
[11:29] the law of moses
[11:31] that thou mayest prosper in all that
[11:34] thou
[11:34] doest and whithersoever thou turnest
[11:40] thyself
[11:43] that the lord may continue his word
[11:47] which he spake concerning me saying
[11:50] if thy children take heed to their way
[11:54] now listen
[11:54] david is reciting a promise
[11:58] that god made him in his life
[12:03] he is concerned that that promise
[12:06] not die with him he wants that promise
[12:10] from god to continue on to his
[12:13] children and his children's children
[12:16] i don't know there's a man in here that
[12:18] feels that way today but i've got a
[12:20] feeling
[12:21] that anything the lord has promised you
[12:24] you want to not only see that activated
[12:27] and in fruition in your life but you'd
[12:30] like to know that it would be an
[12:31] inherited promise
[12:33] that your children might be able to walk
[12:36] in the benefit of that
[12:37] and your grandchildren if jesus should
[12:40] tarry
[12:41] so david is speaking very personally
[12:45] to solomon solomon was the tenth
[12:48] son of king david he was the second son
[12:52] by david's wife bathsheba and he had a
[12:56] very close relationship with his father
[12:59] david
[13:00] he said now that the lord may continue
[13:03] his word which he spake concerning me
[13:05] saying
[13:06] if thy children take heed to their way
[13:09] to walk before me in truth
[13:11] with all their heart with all their soul
[13:15] mind will and emotions
[13:18] there shall not fail thee said he
[13:21] a man on the throne of israel
[13:26] this was a promise that was not just
[13:28] that
[13:29] david would have a glorious reign as
[13:32] king
[13:32] but that this kingship would pass
[13:36] down from generation to generation
[13:40] and you know that even our lord will sit
[13:42] on the throne
[13:44] of his father david and rule and reign
[13:46] in the millennium
[13:47] so this was a kingship that was so
[13:50] spiritual in nature
[13:52] that it was also a messianic promise and
[13:55] david said to solomon i want to make
[13:57] sure
[13:58] that you are reminded that we as a
[14:01] family have a promise
[14:03] and it's going to be for me for my
[14:06] children
[14:06] for my children's children but we have a
[14:09] responsibility
[14:10] to take heed of our ways before the lord
[14:15] make sure that we're walking in truth
[14:18] with all of our heart with all of our
[14:20] mind with all of our
[14:22] will with all of our emotions we're not
[14:25] allowing anything to pull us out
[14:27] of the promise of god we want to stay
[14:30] very
[14:31] very close to him because we want to see
[14:34] the fulfillment
[14:36] hallelujah we want to see the
[14:38] fulfillment
[14:39] of everything that he has promised i
[14:42] know brother branham had that desire
[14:44] he wanted his children to walk
[14:48] in the promise that god had given him he
[14:50] guarded them and he watched over them
[14:53] and he spoke publicly to encourage them
[14:56] and to strengthen them because he
[14:58] believed that one day
[15:00] he would lay the bible down and his sons
[15:02] would pick up the bible
[15:04] and go on and continue to do the work of
[15:06] the lord this was his desire
[15:09] and it was a noble desire you here are
[15:12] you in me this morning
[15:13] it was a noble desire and
[15:16] even if you say well i don't have i
[15:18] don't have sons
[15:20] well i want you to know you can have
[15:22] spiritual inheritance
[15:23] in your daughters don't worry about that
[15:26] brother don't let that be anything
[15:28] my may they continue to go on and
[15:31] carry on fulfilling the promises of god
[15:34] participating in the covenant
[15:36] that you have made before the lord
[15:38] because they're going to be a blessing
[15:40] to adapt to other husbands and
[15:43] they're going to be mothers to other
[15:45] generations
[15:47] and so i like this when i think about
[15:49] the fact
[15:51] we can't call our children for a
[15:53] specific calling
[15:55] but god can and he knew who they were
[15:58] and he knew who we were when he gave
[16:01] them to us
[16:03] and he didn't make any provision to give
[16:04] them back
[16:08] so we've got to do something with him
[16:11] he's given them to us
[16:13] the very first father in the bible was
[16:16] not a man at all
[16:18] he was the eternal spirit of god who
[16:21] created adam and eve
[16:23] who placed them in the garden give me
[16:26] ephesians 4
[16:26] 6 and let's see that just a moment it
[16:29] says one god
[16:31] one god and father of all
[16:36] who is above all and through
[16:39] all and in you all
[16:42] that's where fatherhood began it began
[16:47] in the garden of eden it began
[16:50] in the mind of god god
[16:54] himself had a desire
[16:57] to be a father if you'll give me
[17:00] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[17:03] paragraph 143 i want to share with you
[17:07] just a few things
[17:08] that the prophet said about god's desire
[17:12] to be a father he talks about
[17:16] fatherhood and sonhood
[17:19] or sonship being joined
[17:23] together when the word became flesh
[17:28] it's another level it's another layer
[17:30] it's another way of
[17:32] looking at the fact that jesus said when
[17:35] you've seen me you've seen the father
[17:37] because there he was standing there
[17:40] representing fatherhood
[17:42] and sonship all at the same time
[17:45] as the same person brother branham said
[17:48] here
[17:49] in paragraph 143 but what he wanted to
[17:52] do
[17:53] he loved fatherhood
[17:56] god loved fatherhood
[18:00] for he was a father and the only way
[18:03] that he could express it
[18:08] was to become a son
[18:12] a man he was not satisfied
[18:17] with spiritual fatherhood only
[18:21] he was so much of a father
[18:24] there were so many attributes of a
[18:27] father in him
[18:29] that the only way they could be
[18:31] expressed
[18:32] was for him to also become a man
[18:36] to also become a son brother branham
[18:39] goes on to say that's the reason
[18:41] jesus kept saying the son of man
[18:45] see they didn't know what he was talking
[18:48] about
[18:49] many of them
[18:52] but now you get it and the congregation
[18:55] says amen see he wanted
[18:58] to express himself that was his
[19:02] one of his great threefold purposes
[19:06] was to express himself to identify
[19:10] himself
[19:11] with human beings to reveal his self
[19:15] in christ when the word became flesh
[19:19] fatherhood and sonship both
[19:22] were on display in a message calling
[19:26] jesus
[19:26] on the scene paragraph 37
[19:30] brother bantam said remember in flesh
[19:33] he was just a man
[19:38] it's important to know there's great
[19:40] debate right now
[19:42] all across the theological world about
[19:44] his flesh
[19:46] was he deity in flesh
[19:49] and the prophet answers that question
[19:51] for us he was deity
[19:53] in a body of flesh but his flesh was the
[19:56] flesh of a man
[19:58] he said remember in flesh he was just a
[20:00] man but in spirit
[20:02] he was god but a man in flesh
[20:06] therefore his body was a human being
[20:09] that was subject to temptations subject
[20:12] to sicknesses
[20:14] and just the same as ours
[20:18] as he had to put on be a man a human
[20:22] and then he was god in the spirit he
[20:25] said i
[20:26] and my father are one my father
[20:30] dwelleth in me what a oneness
[20:33] what a union there was between the
[20:36] eternal spirit of the father
[20:38] that dwelt in him and the body of our
[20:41] lord
[20:41] the son it's pretty powerful when john
[20:45] baptized him on the river jordan we see
[20:48] god
[20:49] descending from heaven like a dove
[20:52] and the voice saying this is
[20:56] my beloved son in whom
[21:00] i am pleased to dwell
[21:03] powerful announcement wouldn't you say
[21:06] he god
[21:07] dwelt in christ and in him
[21:11] was the fullness of the godhead
[21:14] bodily and the father wanted
[21:17] to announce it to the whole world he
[21:21] wanted the whole world to know
[21:23] what is standing before you is a perfect
[21:25] creation
[21:27] hallelujah a new creation there's
[21:30] never been another one like him
[21:34] come on now there's never been another
[21:36] son
[21:37] like he's standing before you and i'm
[21:40] pleased
[21:40] to live in him i'm pleased to
[21:44] dwell in him i'm pleased to be
[21:46] identified
[21:47] with him it was god expressing his self
[21:51] through jesus and jesus was the
[21:54] vindication
[21:55] or we could say manifestation of god
[21:59] paragraph 40 god the father in the form
[22:02] of the holy spirit
[22:04] was in a pillar of fire and that no one
[22:08] could touch around him
[22:10] he was holy no sin offering was made
[22:15] just a potential offering
[22:18] he said now that same pillar of fire
[22:22] listen now that same pillar of fire
[22:25] the fatherhood so every time
[22:29] we think about the pillar of fire we can
[22:32] now
[22:32] identify the pillar of fire with
[22:35] fatherhood
[22:36] this was the demonstration of god as a
[22:40] father
[22:41] when he appeared in the pillar of fire
[22:44] he came down
[22:45] and was made god in sonship
[22:49] how was that in the body of our lord
[22:52] jesus christ
[22:53] can you say amen he dwelt in a pillar of
[22:56] fire
[22:57] but here he in the shekinah glory
[23:00] where he dwelt in a body which was his
[23:04] son that he created
[23:07] in the form of a man so that
[23:10] made him the son of god
[23:13] the second adam the new testament we
[23:16] know calls him
[23:17] the last adam he said now he had to come
[23:20] through the womb
[23:22] of a woman not like adam
[23:26] how many of you know adam didn't come
[23:28] through the womb of a woman
[23:30] he came here from the fingertips of god
[23:33] but jesus when he was revealing both
[23:37] fathership and sonship fatherhood
[23:41] and sonship he had to be born through
[23:44] the womb of a woman not like
[23:46] adam because that's what he had to
[23:49] condemn
[23:50] the birth of a human being by a woman
[23:53] remember we go back to the curse
[23:56] see so he had to come that way now
[23:58] that's
[23:59] god the son the same god and now he
[24:02] through offering that body without sin
[24:06] made a human offering so we can say
[24:10] that we could have never understood the
[24:12] fatherhood of god
[24:15] we could have never understood sonship
[24:18] as spiritual born children of the living
[24:21] god
[24:22] had it not been for the lord jesus
[24:24] christ not just our savior
[24:26] but the very demonstration of what your
[24:29] relationship
[24:31] and my relationship is to god it was
[24:34] demonstrated for us
[24:35] in the life in the body in the ministry
[24:38] of the lord jesus christ just one more
[24:40] and that's all the reading of quotes we
[24:43] have for today
[24:43] in the message questions and answers
[24:46] paragraph 108 he said when man
[24:50] was made in the image of god
[24:56] and then god came down
[24:59] in the image of man
[25:02] now listen first man made in the image
[25:06] of god
[25:07] adam and then god came down
[25:10] in the image of man jesus christ to
[25:13] redeem man
[25:15] that brought man and god
[25:20] together first man
[25:23] came in the form of god and then
[25:26] god came in the form of man
[25:30] this was the union between god and man
[25:34] and it was the union between fatherhood
[25:37] and sonship
[25:38] he goes on to say heavens and earth
[25:42] hugged and kissed each other
[25:45] god and man embraced each other
[25:49] as fatherhood and sonship
[25:53] when the logos became flesh
[25:56] and dwelt among us so i want you to see
[25:59] fatherhood
[26:00] and sonship embracing one another
[26:04] in this beautiful demonstration of what
[26:07] a
[26:07] son is like and what a father is like
[26:11] i want you to know we have a good father
[26:14] we have a father who went all the way
[26:17] on our behalf if we don't know how
[26:21] and we don't know what and we don't know
[26:23] how to carry out the role
[26:25] all we have to do is look to him as our
[26:28] example
[26:29] we have a good good father
[26:32] we have a good good papa we have so much
[26:36] to be thankful for i want to read acts
[26:39] chapter 17 verse 24
[26:43] through 26. if you have your bible you
[26:46] might want to look there
[26:47] but if not it'll be up on the screen for
[26:50] you in just a moment
[26:51] acts chapter 17 verses 24 through 26
[26:56] it says god that made the world
[27:00] and all things therein seeing
[27:04] that he is lord of heaven and earth
[27:07] dwelleth not in temples made with hands
[27:12] neither is worshipped with men's hands
[27:16] as though he needed anything seeing
[27:20] he giveth to all life and
[27:23] breath and all things how many of you
[27:26] say again i got a good papa
[27:28] oh i've got a good daddy and had
[27:31] made of one blood you need to hear this
[27:36] all nations all races
[27:40] all walks of life have been made one
[27:43] blood
[27:44] of men all nations of men
[27:47] for to dwell on all the face of the
[27:50] earth
[27:51] and hath determined the times before
[27:54] appointed
[27:55] and the bounds of their habitation
[27:59] another example another demonstration
[28:02] of the sovereignty of god before the
[28:05] first man
[28:06] ever came to live on the earth god had
[28:09] already made of one blood all nations of
[28:11] men
[28:12] he had already determined the times of
[28:15] men
[28:16] appointed them before they were ever
[28:18] born
[28:19] and the bonds or bounds of their
[28:21] habitation
[28:22] every bit of this determined in the mind
[28:25] of god
[28:25] in the mind of a good god in the mind of
[28:29] a good father
[28:31] hallelujah the bible dictionary
[28:35] when it defines the word father it says
[28:38] a male parent
[28:41] any ancestor because we know
[28:45] that sometimes father in the plural
[28:47] fathers
[28:49] is meant to describe those who have gone
[28:52] before us
[28:53] it can mean god in scripture it has
[28:58] it can mean the creator or the
[29:00] originator of something
[29:02] it can also be a polite form of address
[29:06] to a superior and we don't mean
[29:09] the the catholic priest but we mean
[29:12] in certain cultures they would say and
[29:15] we hear more often
[29:17] in africa than we would perhaps in the
[29:20] united states
[29:21] a senior man or one who is going to be
[29:24] esteemed with some
[29:26] respect will be referred to as father or
[29:28] uncle
[29:29] even though there may not be any kind of
[29:31] blood relation between them
[29:33] but the term father it can be used as a
[29:37] as a term of respect for someone
[29:40] who has had experience in life
[29:43] when we look at the role of a father
[29:46] we're looking at
[29:48] something that is not an easy task
[29:55] but i'm so thankful that god gave us a
[29:58] perfect example
[30:00] the good news is that god did not just
[30:03] give us a pattern
[30:04] of perfection but he promised to help
[30:08] all of us who become fathers to reflect
[30:11] his image
[30:12] man's job is to trust god
[30:16] and to follow god and to ask god
[30:19] the perfect father to ask god for help
[30:22] in knowing how to father in knowing how
[30:24] to be a father
[30:27] in the in the revel bible dictionary
[30:30] which is one that i often look to
[30:33] it gives us biblical
[30:37] responsibilities of a father
[30:41] and i want to read a few of those and
[30:43] give you scriptures that are related to
[30:45] this concept
[30:47] biblically a father is to be the
[30:50] spiritual head
[30:51] of the family come on now
[30:55] doesn't mean we don't need our wives we
[30:58] need spiritual women
[30:59] but it's their it's not their
[31:01] responsibility to be the priest of the
[31:03] home
[31:04] or the spiritual head of the family can
[31:07] we look at exodus 12
[31:09] 3 i'm going to just kind of call these
[31:11] out quick and i know you're waiting on
[31:12] the computer
[31:13] although i hope that one is a little
[31:15] faster we we swapped it out i think so
[31:18] that it would would help a little bit in
[31:20] getting those scriptures pulled up
[31:21] exodus 12 3 it says speakee unto all the
[31:25] congregation of israel
[31:27] saying in the tenth day of this month
[31:30] they shall take to them every man a lamb
[31:33] according to the house of their fathers
[31:37] a lamb for a house that wasn't mama's
[31:41] responsibility
[31:44] that was an anti's responsibility that
[31:46] was daddy's responsibility
[31:49] now i want you to know it was a
[31:50] responsibility that had great
[31:52] repercussions
[31:54] the very safety and the survival
[31:58] of the children in that home depended
[32:02] on the father's willingness to obey the
[32:05] word of the lord
[32:06] if he didn't provide the lamb there was
[32:08] no lamb provided
[32:10] so the scripture's pretty clear it's the
[32:13] husband
[32:14] it's the father's responsibility to be
[32:16] the spiritual head of the family don't
[32:18] panic
[32:20] don't panic because we have a great
[32:22] example
[32:25] i'm going to say that a bunch we have a
[32:27] great
[32:28] example don't you wallow around
[32:31] in your feeling of insufficiency or
[32:33] inability we have a great example
[32:36] just lean on him just lean on him he'll
[32:39] help us
[32:40] he will help us job chapter 1 verse 5
[32:44] and it was so when the days of their
[32:46] feasting were gone
[32:48] about that job sent and sanctified them
[32:52] and rose up early in the morning and
[32:54] offered burnt
[32:55] offerings according to the number of
[32:58] them all
[32:59] this was job's children job was getting
[33:02] up
[33:02] early and he was offering a burnt
[33:05] offering
[33:06] on behalf of every one of his
[33:10] children wouldn't that have been their
[33:12] place
[33:16] wouldn't it have been i don't know how
[33:17] old they were
[33:19] i'm not sure their age here
[33:22] it seems that it would have been their
[33:24] responsibility
[33:25] to make their offering to the lord but i
[33:27] want you to know job took his role
[33:30] as a priest in the home job took his
[33:33] role as the spiritual head of the family
[33:35] he took it pretty serious and he offered
[33:38] burnt offerings according to the number
[33:39] of them all
[33:40] for jobs said it may be
[33:44] that my sons have sinned and
[33:47] cursed god in their hearts thus
[33:50] did job continually does that do
[33:53] anything for anybody
[33:55] you know that but brother steve that
[33:57] verse does something for me
[33:59] we we can't control our children they
[34:02] get to a certain age
[34:03] we can't control them the way that we'd
[34:05] like to
[34:07] but i'll tell you what we can do we can
[34:09] still be a priest for them
[34:11] come on now we can still go before the
[34:14] lord on their behalf
[34:15] and lay the offering out and say the
[34:18] blood of jesus
[34:20] the blood of jesus over my sons
[34:25] the blood of jesus over my daughters
[34:29] the blood of jesus over my
[34:31] daughter-in-laws the blood of jesus
[34:34] over my son-in-laws hallelujah
[34:37] somebody said you think that do any good
[34:39] yes because our perfect father was also
[34:42] a perfect intercessor
[34:44] he taught us by example how to be a
[34:47] father
[34:48] he taught us by example how to be an
[34:50] intercessor
[34:51] he taught us by example how to take
[34:54] serious
[34:55] our spiritual role so i want you to know
[34:58] it's not just getting them here
[35:01] but it's and you know this is a beaut
[35:03] this is not this is not something to
[35:04] wear you out
[35:06] this this is something to let you know
[35:09] that you have a role
[35:10] now mama can pray and mama can fast
[35:14] and mama can cry out to god but i don't
[35:17] read here
[35:18] where mother is the one who laid out the
[35:20] offering
[35:21] on behalf of her children it seemed like
[35:23] job did it as a daddy
[35:25] and here was his reasoning he said it
[35:28] may be
[35:29] that my sons have sinned and cursed god
[35:31] in their heart so i'm going to be right
[35:33] here
[35:34] doing what they may not be doing on
[35:35] their own behalf
[35:37] what good does it do i tell you it moves
[35:39] angels in their direction
[35:42] it shifts the heavens over their head
[35:45] you don't ever have to give up i don't
[35:48] care how far they go
[35:50] i don't care what they land in i don't
[35:53] care how they hate what you love
[35:55] you can go before god as a spiritual
[35:59] intercessor and say i'm claiming them
[36:02] brother branham told us we have every
[36:04] right to claim our children
[36:06] as children of god as sons of god
[36:10] and i i think i think this is a pretty
[36:12] powerful demonstration
[36:14] that we see in the life of job
[36:17] the bible also tells us that the father
[36:21] with the help of his wife
[36:24] was to oversee the education of their
[36:27] children
[36:29] i appreciated something that was said in
[36:32] the graduation the other night by one of
[36:34] the
[36:35] by either abby or zoe
[36:39] i i think it was and they mentioned the
[36:42] fact
[36:43] that their dad was there with their mom
[36:47] in their education they were co-teachers
[36:51] in the sense that they partnered
[36:53] together
[36:54] for the education of their children the
[36:56] kids noticed it
[36:59] and they brought our attention to it
[37:02] and this is the biblical example this is
[37:04] the biblical way
[37:06] it's not just to leave a mother on our
[37:08] own to try to figure it all out
[37:10] according to the bible it's also our
[37:13] responsibility as fathers
[37:15] to help oversee to help make sure
[37:19] you say well i do my part i buy it well
[37:21] i want you to know your
[37:22] your advice your leadership your
[37:26] intelligence is needed in other ways
[37:28] than just the investment of your
[37:30] pocketbook right
[37:31] and i thought wow here it was just
[37:34] called out
[37:34] for all of us to see what an example of
[37:36] how it's supposed to operate
[37:38] the bible tells us in deuteronomy 6
[37:42] verses 4 through 9 hear o
[37:45] israel the lord our god is
[37:50] one lord and thou shalt love
[37:53] the lord thy god with all thine heart
[37:56] with all thy
[37:56] soul with all thy might and these words
[38:00] which i command me this
[38:02] command thee this day shall be in thine
[38:05] heart
[38:06] and thou shall teach them diligently
[38:10] unto thy children and shall
[38:13] talk of them when thou sittest in thine
[38:16] house
[38:17] and when thou walkest by the way
[38:21] and when thou liest down and when thou
[38:24] risest up and thou shalt bind them for a
[38:27] sign
[38:28] upon thine hand and they shall be as
[38:31] frontlets
[38:32] between thine eyes and thou shalt write
[38:34] them upon the post
[38:36] of thy house and on thy gates again
[38:39] this is the role of a spiritual priest
[38:44] as the spiritual head of the home we are
[38:47] assisting
[38:48] in their natural education and as
[38:51] fathers
[38:52] we are responsible to provide that
[38:55] spiritual education that they need
[38:58] and here's the way it's done not by
[39:00] sending them off to school
[39:03] [Applause]
[39:04] you know you look at the hour we're
[39:06] living in now and you just wonder in
[39:08] your mind
[39:09] what is in a parent's head
[39:14] to send their kid down to egypt
[39:19] to be trained for life i want you to
[39:22] know
[39:23] everything and anything you can imagine
[39:26] is down there in egypt
[39:28] hanging around the schoolhouse god
[39:31] never intended for education to be
[39:34] institutionalized
[39:35] there's not one scripture in the bible
[39:37] that speaks like that
[39:39] but every scripture tells us it's our
[39:41] responsibility
[39:42] as parents to teach them the things they
[39:45] need to know
[39:46] somebody said i'm so afraid i don't know
[39:48] everything i need to know
[39:49] to pass on to my children let me tell
[39:51] you something you do what god commands
[39:54] you to do
[39:55] and you believe that god will help you
[39:58] and direct you
[39:59] and place for you uh the right
[40:02] curriculum the right structure
[40:05] that you need you'll be all right
[40:09] you'll be all right oh don't let it get
[40:11] quiet
[40:13] you'll be all right homeschool children
[40:16] are some of the highest ranking children
[40:20] educationally in the entire united
[40:22] states
[40:23] our universities are very very happy to
[40:25] stamp them up
[40:28] and that's something you should also
[40:29] think about
[40:31] long and hard because we're finding out
[40:35] that universities are equipped to take
[40:38] out of our children
[40:39] in four years what we have put in them
[40:42] in 12.
[40:44] so it's something to think about there's
[40:47] god's got a plan don't you worry god's
[40:48] got a plan
[40:50] he's got a way for you to do it so that
[40:52] it doesn't have that negative effect
[40:54] who would have ever thought education
[40:56] would come right to our houses
[40:58] and that's where it is right now did you
[41:00] know the biggest a very big percentage
[41:03] of
[41:03] of uh gra excuse me of 2021 graduates
[41:06] a big percentage of 2021 graduates in
[41:09] the united states
[41:10] are already enrolled in colleges and
[41:12] will never have to leave their living
[41:14] room
[41:17] we will have the highest number of
[41:20] recent graduates enrolled in freshman
[41:23] year of university
[41:24] who will never have to leave their
[41:26] living room god makes a way
[41:29] he'll make a way he'll make a way if we
[41:32] trust him don't get quiet
[41:34] he'll make a way and then proverbs 22
[41:37] and 6 tells us train up a child
[41:41] and that's not just telling them what to
[41:43] do how many of you know training is a
[41:46] whole lot
[41:47] more than just telling them what to do
[41:52] you take an animal i don't mean your
[41:54] children or animals well
[42:00] i don't want to make you mad
[42:06] the analogy that was used here in
[42:08] deuteronomy is an analogy that's used
[42:11] for the animal
[42:13] if you were to go to amish country today
[42:17] you would see an example of this binding
[42:20] with frontlets for their eyes
[42:22] because you'll often see the amish
[42:25] horses pulling the amish buggies
[42:28] and many many times you'll see frontlets
[42:31] on the eyes of those horses
[42:33] blinders they call them to help
[42:37] keep out the distraction and
[42:40] hopefully keep the horse from being
[42:43] spooked
[42:44] and running dangerously into a ditch
[42:47] and they still have to deal with the
[42:49] ignorance of people
[42:50] honking their horns and pulling too
[42:53] close to the vehicles
[42:54] and so forth and that's why we read
[42:56] every year
[42:57] that there are precious amish people who
[43:00] lose their lives
[43:02] in buggy wrecks and things and a lot of
[43:03] them have to do with the fact
[43:05] that people are not respectful of
[43:07] someone trying to do it a different way
[43:09] but this is part of the concept and
[43:12] training
[43:13] is not just telling them what to do
[43:15] training is showing them consequences
[43:25] when we're training dogs not to make a
[43:29] mess in the house
[43:30] we reward them when they obey
[43:35] it's positive reinforcement that makes
[43:40] an amazing difference
[43:42] in getting an animal to behave properly
[43:45] it's called training
[43:47] the word that's used here is not just
[43:49] telling the child
[43:50] it's training the child lots of
[43:54] positive reinforcements
[43:58] and on the occasion
[44:03] that too proverbs 13
[44:06] 24 in the amplified he who spares his
[44:10] rod
[44:12] the rod of discipline hates his son
[44:16] but he who loves him disciplines
[44:19] diligently
[44:21] and punishes him early now how many of
[44:24] you believe that's right
[44:28] it is right how do we know because we
[44:31] have an example
[44:34] we have training that's in
[44:37] that's involved in our spiritual
[44:40] relationship
[44:41] with our father this
[44:44] concept of discipline
[44:48] when necessary shall i read it
[44:52] hebrews 12 beginning in verse 5
[44:56] and ye have forgotten the exhortation
[44:59] which speaketh unto you as unto children
[45:02] my son
[45:03] despise not thou the chastening of the
[45:05] lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of
[45:07] him
[45:08] for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth
[45:10] and scourgeth every son
[45:12] whom he receiveth if he endure the if he
[45:15] endure chastening
[45:16] god dealeth with you as with sons for
[45:18] what son is he
[45:20] whom the father chasteneth not but if
[45:23] you be without chastisement
[45:25] whereof all are partakers then are you
[45:27] bastards and not
[45:28] sons furthermore we have had fathers of
[45:31] our flesh
[45:32] which corrected us and we gave them
[45:34] reverence
[45:35] shall we not much rather be in
[45:37] subjection unto the father of spirits
[45:40] and lie and live for they verily for a
[45:43] few days chastened us after their own
[45:45] pleasure
[45:46] but he for our prophet that we might be
[45:49] partakers of his holiness
[45:51] what a promise now no chastening for the
[45:54] present seemeth to be joyous but
[45:56] grievous
[45:57] nevertheless afterward it yielded the
[45:59] peaceable fruit of righteousness unto
[46:00] them which are exercised thereby
[46:03] remember this perfect example that we
[46:05] have of god being a father to
[46:07] us it's not just the positive
[46:09] reinforcement but it's also
[46:11] the reminder that there's a consequence
[46:14] for making a bad choice
[46:16] i think children are amazing i think
[46:19] even small little babies are amazing
[46:22] and i think we underestimate what
[46:23] they're able to understand because we
[46:25] don't think they can understand
[46:27] i don't know if i'll get in trouble or
[46:29] not i don't think it's likely
[46:31] but uh just recently we were sitting out
[46:33] here at a volleyball game
[46:35] ezekiel was in my lap and he kept going
[46:37] for my glasses
[46:39] i had my glasses in my pocket and he
[46:41] kept going for my glasses and i said no
[46:43] no no
[46:44] you know try to distract him he's just
[46:45] little not a year old
[46:47] just try to distract him so that he
[46:50] wouldn't keep reaching for them but i
[46:51] want you to know they got longer
[46:52] memories than their parents
[46:55] he remembered well he'd go 10 minutes to
[46:58] do something else and then all of a
[46:59] sudden
[47:00] spin around and go for those glasses no
[47:03] i didn't spank him he wasn't mind to
[47:04] spank that doesn't mean i wouldn't do it
[47:06] but i didn't do it but i'll tell you
[47:09] what i did do
[47:10] i took his little hand as he reached up
[47:12] there for the glasses i took my
[47:14] one finger i never swatted him
[47:17] i never struck him i just took my one
[47:20] finger i never even thumped him
[47:22] i just took my finger and did like that
[47:24] on his just that
[47:26] gentle i don't believe you did i did
[47:28] because i didn't know who was looking
[47:32] did it just that gentle and i looked him
[47:34] right in the eye and i said no
[47:39] oh he didn't know what you were saying
[47:41] then why in the world did he twist up
[47:43] his
[47:44] face
[47:49] he twisted his face
[47:52] in the most awful thing you have crushed
[47:55] my feelings
[47:58] and it was in that moment zach that i
[48:01] realized he knows exactly
[48:03] that he i'm sure he's heard no before
[48:06] i'm sure that mother and dad are already
[48:08] telling him no they better
[48:13] but i didn't know how much he understood
[48:16] but just that
[48:18] no and the look on his face
[48:22] not you too that's how he looked not you
[48:25] too
[48:26] surely not you you're not gonna be one
[48:29] of them too
[48:30] are you i realize he's at the perfect
[48:34] age
[48:38] not to be just told what to do but to be
[48:41] shown what to do
[48:43] the bible said this is part of a dad's
[48:46] responsibility
[48:48] to train a child in the way he should go
[48:50] and when he is old he will not depart
[48:52] from it
[48:53] and i want you to know that many of you
[48:54] have done an amazing job
[48:56] in doing that if you have if you have
[49:00] uh you know sometimes dads
[49:03] who feel a little bit slighted in life
[49:07] and want so much to be loved and
[49:10] respected by their children
[49:12] sometimes they slack off or pull back
[49:15] withdraw a little bit from the area of
[49:18] discipline
[49:19] because they want to be the popular they
[49:21] want to be the accepted they want to be
[49:23] the cool
[49:23] you understand and and it's
[49:25] circumstances that kind of put them in
[49:27] that position
[49:28] but i want you to know you'll never be
[49:31] sorry
[49:32] you will never be sorry that you did
[49:35] your part
[49:36] in training your children you'll be able
[49:39] to stand out and watch them in a crowd
[49:41] and know
[49:42] that it might not have been popular it
[49:44] might not have made you feel as good as
[49:45] you needed to feel
[49:47] but now watching them and how they
[49:48] conduct themselves there's a lot of joy
[49:50] in that
[49:51] can you say amen the bible said it's a
[49:53] father's responsibility
[49:55] to provide for the needs of his family
[49:57] we talked about the spiritual needs
[49:59] and the areas of education but the bible
[50:02] talks about
[50:03] to be a provider for the family that's
[50:05] what the scripture said
[50:07] it's our responsibility you know we i
[50:10] know that uh
[50:11] the way that people live today it almost
[50:14] requires
[50:15] two incomes three incomes
[50:19] but this isn't the way god designed it
[50:21] in the beginning will anybody help me
[50:24] this isn't the way god intended for it
[50:26] to be in the beginning
[50:28] especially when the children start
[50:29] coming they need that constant
[50:32] daily attention
[50:36] that constant daily presence of the mama
[50:41] in their life i know a lot of men have
[50:44] worked two jobs
[50:46] their fingers to the bone because they
[50:49] wanted
[50:49] a wife who could be home with their
[50:52] children god
[50:53] bless you god bless you
[50:58] the bible said in proverbs 6 6 through
[51:00] 11
[51:01] that we should consider the ant
[51:06] the bible goes on to say in verse 10 of
[51:09] 6 yet a little sleep a little
[51:11] slumber a little folding of the hands to
[51:13] sleep and so shall thy poverty come as
[51:15] one that
[51:16] traveleth and thy want as an armed man
[51:21] this is one of the most serious
[51:25] scriptures concerning a man's
[51:26] responsibility to provide for his own
[51:29] and i only read this
[51:33] so that every child and every teenager
[51:36] every young adult in this church will be
[51:39] able to be thankful
[51:41] because we have providers
[51:44] in our life come on say amen
[51:48] come on mama we have men
[51:51] who take providing for their children
[51:54] for their wives for their families very
[51:56] very serious
[51:58] first timothy 5 8 says but if any
[52:00] provide not
[52:01] for his own and especially for those of
[52:04] his own house
[52:05] he hath denied the faith and is worse
[52:09] than an infidel and that's a heathen
[52:13] that doesn't acknowledge god
[52:15] it's our responsibility when we're tired
[52:17] when we're not tired
[52:19] when i hear about these young men i say
[52:21] i do say
[52:23] they're young i thank god that they have
[52:25] the youth to do it
[52:26] but i also recognize that their
[52:28] responsibility is great
[52:30] and when i hear about these young
[52:32] married daddies who have to sometimes
[52:34] report to work at three o'clock in the
[52:36] morning or
[52:37] work every saturday and the only day
[52:40] they get off is sunday and they spend a
[52:41] great portion of it here in the house of
[52:43] god
[52:43] i think about it i think about the fact
[52:46] that we're blessed
[52:48] to have men like that in our church and
[52:50] we're blessed like that our kids are
[52:52] blessed
[52:53] the ones that we love the kids and
[52:55] grandkids around here
[52:57] we can say how blessed they are to have
[53:00] a dad who is willing and you know to me
[53:02] it doesn't matter
[53:03] if it's all by his hands
[53:06] if it's by carpentry work or it's all by
[53:09] physical labor
[53:10] i don't care what color his collar is
[53:13] it doesn't matter whether it's blue
[53:14] collar white collar the bible doesn't
[53:16] say
[53:17] that one is to be honored or respected
[53:19] more than the other it's just the need
[53:21] should be met and it's a dad's
[53:24] responsibility to make sure
[53:26] that our children are provided for i'm
[53:29] going to tell you the best way i know
[53:32] how to address birth control
[53:36] don't dare have any more than you can
[53:39] provide for
[53:41] you're not doing anybody a service
[53:44] just a minute amen brother shelly
[53:48] amen we're not just having them for the
[53:50] government to take care of
[53:53] no no no no no no we're having them
[53:56] because
[53:57] we want to raise them up in the fear of
[53:59] god but we want to provide for their
[54:00] needs along the way
[54:02] can you say amen i'm not going to read
[54:03] this long portion of scripture because i
[54:05] need to hurry
[54:07] but in deuteronomy chapter 22 verses 13
[54:10] through 19
[54:11] just jot it down you'll find out that in
[54:15] a court of law
[54:17] it was a father's responsibility
[54:20] to stand up for the rights of their
[54:24] daughters particularly their daughters
[54:27] there are other verses of scripture in
[54:29] deuteronomy that we could read and apply
[54:32] to sons but particularly deuteronomy 22
[54:37] speaks about a woman being mistreated
[54:41] by her husband because he
[54:45] questions her virginity at the time of
[54:48] their marriage
[54:50] and uh she is not just guilty because he
[54:54] says she is
[54:56] but the bible tells us that that girl's
[55:00] father may go and stand up for her
[55:03] in the court system of the land
[55:08] we know as we study the message of the
[55:10] hour
[55:11] for instance the prophet has told us by
[55:14] the scripture and i know we're streaming
[55:17] but we've been told by the scripture
[55:19] that
[55:20] engagement is a very serious thing
[55:26] we're not a people who believe in dating
[55:28] around
[55:30] we're people who believe that courtship
[55:32] is the right way
[55:34] and courtship is not to try on somebody
[55:36] for size
[55:38] it's to know now mistakes can be made no
[55:41] doubt about it
[55:43] and people can think that they have
[55:44] found the one that god has chosen for
[55:46] them and it not be the
[55:48] case and also the enemy can get involved
[55:51] and do lots of damage
[55:53] because that's what he seeks to do he's
[55:55] the thief
[55:56] and he comes to steal and to kill and to
[55:58] destroy
[55:59] but a father has a very specific and
[56:01] important role when it comes to
[56:03] courtship
[56:04] for his children there's no doubt about
[56:06] it and he also has authority in the
[56:09] scripture to cancel an engagement
[56:15] you would have to be raising children
[56:17] who respected your opinion
[56:20] but i know many times in some very
[56:23] serious situations
[56:25] that i'm aware of in other places
[56:28] where there were perhaps
[56:31] levels of dishonesty and
[56:34] young people find themselves engaged
[56:36] without the proper
[56:40] methods involved i think it's a
[56:44] wonderful thing to have the permission
[56:47] of your mother and father both both
[56:50] parties don't you
[56:53] i just wouldn't want to start out on the
[56:55] road of marriage in 2021
[56:58] knowing that my parents were against it
[57:02] well how could you ever change you might
[57:04] not be able to but
[57:06] i believe that god is able he's
[57:08] certainly able
[57:09] to help their hearts if you're really
[57:12] doing the right thing
[57:14] but i know of situations where fathers
[57:17] have had to step
[57:17] in and say i have serious serious
[57:22] problems and serious concerns
[57:26] and i'm going to have to cancel this
[57:30] and because this is an agreement
[57:33] that in bible days an engagement
[57:36] could only be broken with a divorce
[57:39] not just a marriage but also an
[57:42] engagement
[57:43] so the father has the role a serious
[57:46] role
[57:47] of being involved i've even had young
[57:50] girls say to me after having broken
[57:53] homes
[57:54] i sure wish somebody would have stood up
[57:56] for me
[57:58] and i pray i believe i believe i believe
[58:01] [Laughter]
[58:04] i'm not going to make i was going to
[58:06] kind of make a comment about
[58:08] uh how many weapons are represented
[58:12] by brothers in our church they seem to
[58:15] own quite a collection of them and
[58:20] that might be something to remind a an
[58:23] old boy somewhere if you had to
[58:24] you know
[58:26] [Applause]
[58:30] we wouldn't even know how to begin men
[58:32] we wouldn't even know how to begin
[58:34] had it not been for our example
[58:38] god is a father who loves his children
[58:40] so much he died
[58:42] in their place romans 5 8
[58:45] put it up for me would you romans 5 8
[58:48] but god
[58:49] commendeth his love toward us
[58:52] in that while we were yet sinners
[58:57] christ died for us
[59:00] what a father can somebody say what a
[59:03] father
[59:04] the bible said he's the father who
[59:07] delights
[59:08] in giving wonderful things to his
[59:11] children
[59:12] that's our example
[59:15] that's the example that we have james 1
[59:19] 17 in the amplified bible says every
[59:22] good gift and every perfect
[59:24] free large full gift is from above
[59:28] it comes down from the father of all
[59:30] that gives light
[59:32] in the shining of whom there can be no
[59:34] variation
[59:36] rising or setting or shadow cast by his
[59:39] turning
[59:40] as in an eclipse he gives
[59:43] good gifts and perfect gifts
[59:47] freely to his children so we have no
[59:50] excuse
[59:51] not to know how we have a great example
[59:55] we have a father who loves his children
[59:59] the same
[1:00:03] somebody said what about election you
[1:00:05] understand
[1:00:06] how election came romans
[1:00:09] 2 11 in the amplified bible said for god
[1:00:12] shows no partiality undue favor or
[1:00:17] unfairness
[1:00:18] with him one man is not different
[1:00:22] from another
[1:00:25] that's our example we can't have
[1:00:28] favorites
[1:00:31] he's a father who loves to talk to his
[1:00:33] children
[1:00:35] more than 1200 times in the bible it
[1:00:38] says
[1:00:39] these words god said thus sayeth the
[1:00:43] lord
[1:00:44] the lord said god saith
[1:00:47] jesus said unto them or the word of god
[1:00:49] declares
[1:00:51] 1200 times in the bible
[1:00:54] we have a god who knows how to speak to
[1:00:56] his children
[1:00:57] and how to communicate to his children
[1:00:59] and children need to hear from their dad
[1:01:06] well mama does all the talking you just
[1:01:09] uh
[1:01:10] get your turn
[1:01:14] children need to hear from their daddy
[1:01:17] don't you allow the enemy to cause you
[1:01:20] to feel intimidated
[1:01:22] like you don't have anything to bring
[1:01:24] god knows who you are
[1:01:26] he knows your talents he knows your
[1:01:28] weaknesses
[1:01:29] he knew that when he gave you children
[1:01:32] so let them hear your voice
[1:01:34] our papa our father wants us to hear
[1:01:38] from him god our daddy
[1:01:41] gives us rules
[1:01:44] and he tells us that there are
[1:01:45] consequences of breaking those rules
[1:01:49] the consequences are always exactly
[1:01:56] what he said they would be
[1:02:00] anybody ever found out it's easier to
[1:02:02] threat
[1:02:03] than to carry out god's a better example
[1:02:07] than that
[1:02:08] he told them exactly in genesis 2 verses
[1:02:12] 15 through 17
[1:02:13] exactly how life was to be carried out
[1:02:17] in the garden
[1:02:19] exactly what should be partaken of
[1:02:22] and what should not be and when they did
[1:02:24] exactly the opposite
[1:02:27] of what god told them to do in genesis 3
[1:02:30] verses 9 through 24 god did
[1:02:33] exactly what he said he would do if they
[1:02:36] didn't obey him
[1:02:37] how many of you believe daddies have got
[1:02:39] to be consistent
[1:02:40] we have to be consistent because we have
[1:02:44] an example
[1:02:46] who tells us what is right what is wrong
[1:02:49] and then tells us the price that we're
[1:02:51] going to pay
[1:02:52] proverbs 3 verses 11 and 12 and i'm
[1:02:56] nearly done
[1:02:58] my son despise not the chastening
[1:03:02] of the lord neither be weary of his
[1:03:04] correction
[1:03:06] for whom the lord loveth he correcteth
[1:03:08] even as a father
[1:03:10] the son in whom he delighteth
[1:03:15] it's not always easy but it's part of
[1:03:18] the training process
[1:03:21] one day your voice is going to be
[1:03:22] silenced
[1:03:25] one day your presence is not going to be
[1:03:28] known
[1:03:29] we have to do what we can while we can
[1:03:32] and being consistent
[1:03:34] is so very important
[1:03:37] we have a father who never gives up on
[1:03:39] his children
[1:03:41] he continues to love us no matter what
[1:03:43] we do
[1:03:46] how many of you know not just mamas can
[1:03:47] love unconditionally
[1:03:50] we've had a great example hosea 11 and
[1:03:54] 4. if you'll put that up for me
[1:03:56] jose 11 and 4. i drew them this is
[1:03:59] amplified sorry
[1:04:00] this is amplified i drew them
[1:04:03] with cords of a man
[1:04:07] with bands of love and i was to them
[1:04:12] as one who lives up and eases the yoke
[1:04:17] over their cheeks and i bent down
[1:04:20] to them and gently laid
[1:04:23] food before them
[1:04:26] this is the father's love for even the
[1:04:29] rebellious child
[1:04:31] i drew them with cords of a man with
[1:04:34] bands of love
[1:04:35] and i was to them as one who lifts up
[1:04:37] and eases the yoke
[1:04:39] over their cheeks and i bent down to
[1:04:41] them and gently laid
[1:04:43] food before them it's one thing for us
[1:04:47] to say let them find out for their self
[1:04:50] it's another thing for us to take the
[1:04:51] responsibility that god gave us in the
[1:04:53] beginning
[1:04:54] and love them regardless of how they
[1:04:57] disappoint us
[1:04:59] romans 11 28 also in the amplified
[1:05:02] i like to read this i'd like for you to
[1:05:04] hear this one too
[1:05:06] from the point of view of the gospel
[1:05:09] good news
[1:05:10] they the jews at present are enemies of
[1:05:13] god
[1:05:16] the apostle is saying if you look at the
[1:05:18] jews right now
[1:05:21] second temple period they are enemies of
[1:05:24] god
[1:05:25] which is for your advantage and benefit
[1:05:29] but from the point of view of god's
[1:05:32] choice
[1:05:34] of election of divine selection
[1:05:38] they are still the beloved dear to him
[1:05:41] for the sake of their forefathers
[1:05:46] if you can understand this you can
[1:05:47] understand the conditional love of a
[1:05:49] parent
[1:05:52] it looks like the jews were doing
[1:05:55] everything they could
[1:05:57] to stop the coming of the messiah while
[1:06:00] praying for him to come
[1:06:03] it seems as though they have made
[1:06:04] themselves the enemies of god
[1:06:06] this is how you see them paul said this
[1:06:09] is how they appear to us but if we could
[1:06:12] see the heart of their father
[1:06:14] we would know that in his view they are
[1:06:17] still his chosen
[1:06:19] they are still his select they are still
[1:06:22] his beloved
[1:06:23] oh what an example we have of what a
[1:06:26] father
[1:06:27] is now our father loves
[1:06:30] us but he's made a plan
[1:06:34] to save us to deliver us
[1:06:38] from our mistakes and from our sins
[1:06:42] revelation 21
[1:06:46] verses one through seven this is our
[1:06:48] inheritance
[1:06:50] and i saw a new heaven and a new earth
[1:06:53] for the first heaven and the first earth
[1:06:55] were passed away
[1:06:56] there was no more sea and i john saw
[1:07:00] the holy city new jerusalem coming down
[1:07:03] from god out of heaven
[1:07:04] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[1:07:06] husband and i heard a great voice
[1:07:08] out of heaven saying behold the
[1:07:10] tabernacle of god is with men
[1:07:12] he will dwell with them they shall be
[1:07:15] his people and god himself
[1:07:16] shall be with them and be their god and
[1:07:20] god shall wipe away all tears from their
[1:07:22] eyes
[1:07:22] and there shall be no more death neither
[1:07:24] sorrow nor crying
[1:07:25] neither shall there be any more pain for
[1:07:27] the former things are passed away
[1:07:29] and he that sat upon the throne said
[1:07:31] behold i make all things new
[1:07:33] does this sound good to anybody yet and
[1:07:36] he said unto me right
[1:07:38] for these words are true and faithful
[1:07:41] and he said unto me it is done
[1:07:43] i am alpha and omega the beginning and
[1:07:45] the end i will give unto him that is a
[1:07:48] thirst of the fountain of the water of
[1:07:49] life freely
[1:07:50] he that overcometh shall inherit all
[1:07:53] things and i will be his god
[1:07:55] and he shall be my son
[1:07:58] our father has made a way for our
[1:08:02] salvation
[1:08:03] for our deliverance and he has laid an
[1:08:05] inheritance aside
[1:08:06] with our name on it he is a papa he's a
[1:08:10] father
[1:08:11] who keeps his promises when
[1:08:14] always every time
[1:08:18] give a second peter 1 4 king james
[1:08:23] no amplified forgive me
[1:08:26] i forgot to identify it as amplified but
[1:08:28] i can recognize it because of all the
[1:08:30] parentheses
[1:08:32] by means of these he has bestowed on us
[1:08:36] his precious and exceedingly great
[1:08:39] promises
[1:08:40] so that through them you may escape by
[1:08:42] flight
[1:08:43] from the moral decay rottenness and
[1:08:45] corruption that is in the world
[1:08:47] because of covetousness lust and greed
[1:08:50] and become
[1:08:50] sharers partakers of the divine nature
[1:08:54] he keeps his promises they're precious
[1:08:58] and exceedingly great and he is faithful
[1:09:01] to keep every one of them
[1:09:03] he never lies
[1:09:06] he never lies to his children we have an
[1:09:09] example
[1:09:10] every father in this church we have an
[1:09:12] example of what a father is
[1:09:14] one of those examples he never lies
[1:09:17] numbers 23
[1:09:18] 19 amplified god is not a man
[1:09:23] that he should tell or act a lie
[1:09:27] neither the son of man that he should
[1:09:30] feel repentance
[1:09:31] or compassion for what he excuse me
[1:09:35] compunction for what he has promised
[1:09:39] has he said and shall he not do it
[1:09:43] or has he spoken and shall he not
[1:09:46] make it good oh no if he said it
[1:09:50] if he said it that settles it
[1:09:54] if you believe that same man i want to
[1:09:57] read you one more scripture
[1:09:59] jeremiah 31 1-3
[1:10:02] at the same time saith the lord will i
[1:10:06] be the god of all the families of israel
[1:10:09] and they shall be my people thus saith
[1:10:12] the lord
[1:10:13] the people which were left of the sword
[1:10:15] found grace in the wilderness
[1:10:17] even israel when i went to cause him
[1:10:20] to rest the lord hath appeared of old
[1:10:23] unto me saying yea
[1:10:25] i have loved thee with an everlasting
[1:10:28] love
[1:10:29] therefore with lovingkindness have i
[1:10:32] drawn thee
[1:10:34] that's the example that we have
[1:10:37] of what the father is we can
[1:10:40] follow his example because we can't
[1:10:44] say we can say in the natural maybe i i
[1:10:46] didn't have a father
[1:10:48] to show me how i know what that feels
[1:10:50] like i felt the same
[1:10:52] but when we meditate
[1:10:56] on our father you know i
[1:11:00] have always liked to talk about that
[1:11:03] word abba
[1:11:06] it it doesn't mean daddy
[1:11:09] sometimes we translate it that way
[1:11:14] it's it's a stronger term of endearment
[1:11:18] than daddy it would be like
[1:11:21] papa but maybe when you say daddy you
[1:11:25] say it with the same kind of
[1:11:27] endearment i looked at that word this
[1:11:30] week a little more carefully
[1:11:33] and i found out that there is even a
[1:11:35] deeper meaning
[1:11:37] it is a term of intimacy but it is also
[1:11:41] a pledge
[1:11:43] of obedience when we call him
[1:11:46] papa when we call him abba
[1:11:50] as is mentioned several times in the
[1:11:53] bible
[1:11:54] we're saying we see you
[1:11:59] as our father
[1:12:04] as our dear father
[1:12:07] our papa our example
[1:12:11] but if we should call god the god of
[1:12:14] eternity
[1:12:16] a term like that and we should use
[1:12:20] abba for the full meaning of the word
[1:12:24] in aramaic it actually means
[1:12:28] you are my papa and my desire
[1:12:32] is to please you i think
[1:12:36] every son every daughter has experienced
[1:12:39] that in the natural
[1:12:41] the desire to please a parent
[1:12:45] but in the spiritual when we should call
[1:12:47] him
[1:12:48] papa or abba we're not just saying i
[1:12:52] want
[1:12:52] to have an intimate relationship with
[1:12:56] you
[1:12:57] but we're also saying i want to obey you
[1:13:02] even the nod of your head even the turn
[1:13:05] of your
[1:13:06] eye i want to please you in all things
[1:13:10] how many of you that's your desire you
[1:13:12] want to please
[1:13:13] our heavenly father i'm so thankful
[1:13:16] today for godly men in this house
[1:13:20] i'm so thankful that they're not failing
[1:13:22] their families
[1:13:24] but they are rock solid
[1:13:27] if there is any shadow of turning in us
[1:13:30] then we come to our papa we come to our
[1:13:33] father
[1:13:34] and we say lord strengthen my legs
[1:13:37] strengthen my heart strengthen my walk
[1:13:40] with you
[1:13:41] give me grace to surrender more of who i
[1:13:44] am
[1:13:45] to more of who you'd have me be it is
[1:13:48] not god's will for you to condemn
[1:13:50] yourself
[1:13:52] and your role as a father it's god's
[1:13:54] will for you if you recognize that you
[1:13:57] should be slack and we all
[1:13:58] are in some way or another we have been
[1:14:01] and when we recognize that we are we
[1:14:03] just come to our papa
[1:14:04] we just come to our father and we say
[1:14:07] lord teach me how
[1:14:08] to do a better job the next time how
[1:14:11] many of you believe he will
[1:14:13] it's a great responsibility but it's one
[1:14:16] of the most wonderful
[1:14:17] blessings and privileges that you could
[1:14:20] ever have in this life
[1:14:22] brother i don't mean to keep talking
[1:14:24] about
[1:14:25] uh the graduation
[1:14:28] but it's good to talk about but i
[1:14:31] mentioned to brother kerry here on the
[1:14:33] platform after the service
[1:14:34] how much i enjoyed the song
[1:14:39] and he communicated to me
[1:14:42] what it's like for him to see them
[1:14:45] using their all of them not just the
[1:14:48] graduates but using their talent
[1:14:50] for the lord and how much he enjoys
[1:14:53] being a part of that
[1:14:55] and uh we all know what that feels like
[1:14:59] as a parent you know brother branham
[1:15:04] uh we've heard the testimony
[1:15:07] of i'm just going to say our brother
[1:15:12] because i think he got in a little bit
[1:15:14] of trouble for sharing his testimony
[1:15:17] he saw how there were some people
[1:15:21] who mistreated brother branham's
[1:15:23] children
[1:15:27] and there were others who nearly
[1:15:30] worshiped them
[1:15:32] and he saw that they were going to have
[1:15:35] a real confused
[1:15:36] life so he was a friend to them
[1:15:41] and he was there to remind them of their
[1:15:43] humanity you ever have a friend like
[1:15:45] that
[1:15:47] one who is there to remind you of your
[1:15:50] humanity
[1:15:52] and he would observe a well-meaning
[1:15:56] saints who wanted to obey what brother
[1:15:59] branham said
[1:16:01] brother branham said if you want to do
[1:16:03] something nice for me
[1:16:05] do something nice for my children
[1:16:09] every parent every mother every father
[1:16:12] understands that
[1:16:18] i think any parent in here has the
[1:16:20] potential of being a bear
[1:16:23] when people keep putting their hands on
[1:16:26] their children
[1:16:28] so brother branham just said you want to
[1:16:30] do something nice for me just do
[1:16:31] something nice for my children
[1:16:33] and what he meant was pray for them and
[1:16:35] treat them with love and respect and
[1:16:37] and and be good to them as you can but
[1:16:39] he didn't mean
[1:16:41] support them particularly that was his
[1:16:43] job
[1:16:44] and this friend of ours he would often
[1:16:47] see people
[1:16:48] just handing them money
[1:16:51] and he wanted them to understand that's
[1:16:53] not all
[1:16:54] all the way it's going to be in life it
[1:16:56] might be fun
[1:16:57] for them to do that now and they feel
[1:16:59] good about themselves because they're
[1:17:00] doing what brother branham asked him to
[1:17:02] do but
[1:17:03] handing handing little little kids who
[1:17:06] didn't know any responsibility
[1:17:08] hundred-dollar bills because their daddy
[1:17:10] was a prophet that could be a dangerous
[1:17:12] thing couldn't it
[1:17:13] and so this friend of mine he he said i
[1:17:16] always wanted to show them how to earn
[1:17:18] earn little money and so he would take
[1:17:22] one of the sons around and
[1:17:24] and help him to get odd jobs painting
[1:17:26] fences and
[1:17:28] cleaning up yards and then he could feel
[1:17:32] real good about that money that he had
[1:17:35] earned
[1:17:36] i'd say that friend was doing exactly
[1:17:39] what brother branham was saying
[1:17:41] you love me do something nice for my
[1:17:43] children that's what he was doing
[1:17:46] he didn't want them to be set up with
[1:17:47] some kind of false
[1:17:49] life he wanted them to know
[1:17:52] my they had their share of criticism
[1:17:55] because the children of any leader are
[1:17:58] going to have
[1:17:59] lots of criticism it's always easy for
[1:18:02] people who don't live the life they live
[1:18:04] to criticize but they have to learn like
[1:18:07] all the rest there's a balance
[1:18:10] there's a balance in life you don't get
[1:18:13] uh
[1:18:14] privileges because of who you're related
[1:18:16] to
[1:18:17] you have to earn your way you have to
[1:18:19] show respect you have to do what is
[1:18:21] right
[1:18:23] you have to learn sometimes the hard way
[1:18:26] i want to just say to every daddy here
[1:18:29] i'm blessed to know you i mean that i'm
[1:18:32] blessed to know you
[1:18:33] your children are blessed to have you
[1:18:36] i look around and i see those who
[1:18:38] haven't had that blessing yet
[1:18:40] and i i look forward to i'll just be
[1:18:42] honest
[1:18:43] i look forward to some of these young
[1:18:45] men like josh and different ones
[1:18:47] david's fixing to get married and
[1:18:49] michael christians fixing getting
[1:18:51] married
[1:18:51] i look forward to the to the day that
[1:18:54] they get to enjoy
[1:18:57] what it means to be a dad i look forward
[1:19:01] to being the one that
[1:19:04] gets to do like that

[1:20:28] and you know what i told him i said you

[1:20:31] by saying nothing the look on your face

[1:25:35] will to come and stand here
[1:25:37] just a moment we're going to pray over
[1:25:38] you as a as a group of godly men
[1:25:42] we're going to ask your families to come
[1:25:46] stand behind you and some will be here
[1:25:48] without their family brother
[1:25:50] david manns his wife is out visiting the
[1:25:53] vanden langenbergs and
[1:25:56] i know a lot of us appreciate brother
[1:25:58] david
[1:26:00] would you all ask families you'll have
[1:26:03] to spread out a little bit so your
[1:26:04] family can get around you
[1:26:06] but would you all just come and let's
[1:26:07] lay hands i mean
[1:26:09] i mean sincerely let's put our hands on
[1:26:13] these men
[1:26:15] maybe they mean something to you just in
[1:26:17] a spiritual way and you just like to
[1:26:18] stand with them in that regard but
[1:26:20] would you just come and lay your hand on
[1:26:22] them ask
[1:26:24] god to strengthen their going to
[1:26:26] encourage them when they
[1:26:28] when they feel uh insufficient or
[1:26:32] they get a little overwhelmed with all
[1:26:33] the pulls and pressures of life
[1:26:36] and as a congregation we want to support
[1:26:39] them
[1:26:40] we know their family standing with them
[1:26:42] and supporting them is the most
[1:26:44] important for them
[1:26:45] but we also know that having the body of
[1:26:47] christ
[1:26:49] behind us is helping us so much
[1:26:53] to go forward and to be what god has
[1:26:55] called us to be
[1:26:56] i want us to sing again just a little
[1:26:58] bit more of that and then we're just
[1:26:59] going to pray
[1:27:00] over these men that god will use them
[1:27:03] lord let
[1:27:04] this be the greatest year of their life

[1:28:19] voice and ask that the lord would
[1:28:22] strengthen them and bless them and help
[1:28:23] them in this way
[1:28:26] pray right now would you church
[1:28:29] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:28:34] hallelujah lord there's so much in
[1:28:37] society
[1:28:39] that minimalizes the role of a man in
[1:28:42] his own home
[1:28:44] as a father it seems that hollywood and
