[37:00] gone. I'll pour my
[37:04] love
[37:06] on you.
[37:09] [Music]
[37:12] Oh Jesus.
[37:21] Oh master.
[37:24] You're worthy king of
[37:26] [Music]
[37:28] ky is the lamb.
[37:31] Worthy is the lamb. Worthy lamb.
[37:36] Our king is holy. Lord. There is no one
[37:40] higher than you. He is holy. He's holy.
[37:43] He's holy. We worship you and you alone.
[37:45] We worship you, Lord Jesus. In your
[37:49] majesty, in your splendor, in your
[37:52] glory. You gave your blood that we did
[37:55] not have to die
[37:57] be eternally
[37:59] separated. You gave your blood that we
[38:02] could be saved. We could be redeemed
[38:05] back to you. Yes. Oh God, how we worship
[38:10] you for that.
[38:12] You healed our bodies. You healed our
[38:16] minds. You delivered us, oh Lord, from
[38:21] yesterday. All that had us bound, you
[38:24] delivered us. I thank
[38:27] you. I worship you for who you are.
[38:34] I am not who I used to be.
[38:38] I have been made new
[38:41] because of the blood of the lamb, the
[38:43] Lord Jesus Christ.
[38:46] Praise him. Oh, all praise is due to
[38:49] you, Lord.
[38:52] Hallelujah. Thank you, Master.
[38:54] Hallelujah. Thank you, Master.
[38:58] What a story he wrote for me.
[39:01] What a story he wrote.
[39:05] I am a part of his story.
[39:08] I'm a part of his life.
[39:12] My life is dead and gone. I left it
[39:15] behind me. I'm a part of his story. A
[39:19] part of his
[39:21] life. How grateful I am tonight for
[39:25] that.
[39:26] Do you have a need on your heart by the
[39:29] lifting of the hand? Whether it be a
[39:31] physical need, a spiritual need, whether
[39:35] you need
[39:36] deliverance, whether you need a job,
[39:39] whether you need a lawyer, he is the
[39:42] deliverer, he is the one. He's our
[39:44] advocate.
[39:46] He is everything that I have need of.
[39:49] And I just lift my need to him out
[39:52] across the stream. The Lord knows the
[39:54] need that you have and he is able to
[39:57] meet that need for
[39:59] you. Would you continue to remember the
[40:02] family of brother Samuel Johnson who
[40:05] passed away this week that God would
[40:08] comfort their family, sister Johnson
[40:11] who's still alive in the family, kids,
[40:13] grandkids, great grandkids. And uh
[40:16] remember uh so many need there are so
[40:19] many needs that have come in. We have
[40:22] some that are fighting sickness. Let's
[40:24] pray that they'll be healed tonight and
[40:26] that it won't spread anymore through
[40:28] through this house.
[40:30] Pray for our brother Fisher in Israel
[40:33] and his family, would you? That God will
[40:35] just cover them and surround. Yes. Yes.
[40:38] Amen. Keep them in his care.
[40:41] If praises like
[40:44] perfume, I lavish mine on
[40:48] you. Till every drop is
[40:53] gone, I'll pour my
[40:56] love. Brother David, will you come and
[40:59] lead us to prayer tonight? Like oil upon
[41:03] your
[41:04] feet, like wine for you to drink, like
[41:10] water from my
[41:12] heart. I'll pour my love on
[41:16] you. If praise is like
[41:19] perfume, I'll lavish mine on you. Till
[41:25] every drop is gone.
[41:29] I'll pour my love
[41:40] Jesus.
[41:43] Lord Jesus,
[41:49] the greatest thing that we could ever
[41:50] do.
[41:55] The greatest thing
[41:58] that we could ever
[42:03] accomplish is right before us right now.
[42:07] And it's not a one-time accomplishment.
[42:10] That's it. This isn't a one-time
[42:13] doing. Father, I heard your prophet say,
[42:16] "We need a reoutpouring of the Holy
[42:18] Ghost every hour."
[42:21] Lord
[42:23] Jesus, I can feel you here with us in
[42:25] such a mighty way. in the Lord. Thank
[42:28] you, Lord. There is nothing more
[42:30] important on
[42:31] earth than coming in contact with you.
[42:36] And we have no way to make that happen.
[42:40] But it's your mercy and grace.
[42:43] And we recognize that, Lord. It's not
[42:45] something we're hyping up. It's not
[42:47] something that we're conjuring in our
[42:49] mind. It is a real true outpouring
[42:52] experience of Jesus Christ on his bride
[42:55] once more.
[42:57] And Lord, all we can say for that is
[42:59] thank you so much for choosing us before
[43:02] the foundation of the world. Thank you
[43:04] for setting us up for such a time as
[43:06] this and placing the overcoming power of
[43:09] Jesus in our hearts. Lord, we come
[43:13] tonight not for show. We come not to
[43:15] hear a man. We don't come for any reason
[43:19] but to hear transcend through the
[43:22] corridors of time now Lord and speak
[43:25] through our brother as we get ready to
[43:26] go into this service. Lord this could be
[43:29] our last service and we recognize that
[43:31] there is nothing holding back the
[43:34] sounding of the trumpet. I believe that
[43:36] with all of my heart Lord.
[43:39] Amen. But I pray now as we get ready to
[43:44] transition, the praise has gone forth.
[43:46] There's no doubt about it. I pray Lord
[43:49] from the depths of my soul, I pray that
[43:51] as brother Dwayne gets ready to take
[43:53] this pull pit that the Holy Spirit
[43:56] himself will overshadow him so mightily
[43:58] and speak to every single heart here.
[44:02] Lord, I have needs on my heart. Each and
[44:05] every one of us have a need. And Lord,
[44:07] you are more than able.
[44:11] We're not going to get there by the skin
[44:13] of our teeth because you are more than
[44:16] able.
[44:18] We commit our lives, we commit our
[44:20] minds, we commit our ears, we commit our
[44:24] eyes, we commit our hearts, we commit
[44:28] our subconscious to you, Father.
[44:31] guide our thoughts so they might be holy
[44:35] and looking upon the things of heaven.
[44:37] Please, Lord, it's going to take you.
[44:39] This world has gone stark, grave mad,
[44:42] but Lord, we pray that the angels will
[44:43] guard about us now and create such an
[44:46] atmosphere that we will enter into that
[44:48] holy, holy, holy worship with you.
[44:52] Grant, Lord, we commit this service into
[44:54] your hands now in the precious and most
[44:57] holy name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And
[45:01] amen. Amen. Thank you,
[45:05] Lord. Hallelujah.
[45:09] Oh, we give you praise, Lord, for you're
[45:11] worthy.
[45:14] Hallelujah.
[45:15] [Applause]

[47:54] brother Paco. That's what we call him.
[47:56] That's not really his name, but uh
[47:58] that's what we call him in Honduras. He
[48:01] sends his greetings to brother Shelley
[48:03] and to all of the church. He watches
[48:05] some of the archives of the services.
[48:07] And uh I did not know that the
[48:10] opportunity would open up on Wednesday
[48:12] night. I didn't know if he was going to
[48:14] be home, but the opportunity opened up
[48:16] at his home church uh in Aguablanca,
[48:19] Honduras on Wednesday night. And so he
[48:21] he uh interpreted the service and the
[48:24] Lord moved in a wonderful way and we're
[48:27] thankful for all that he did. But we're
[48:29] glad to be back in the United States.
[48:31] Grateful for the goodness of God, how
[48:33] that God has uh just blessed us in the
[48:37] word here. We're very very blessed uh
[48:41] that God would let us be here. We're
[48:44] glad to be here this weekend. We know
[48:46] that he's going to speak to us every
[48:48] time we go to the house of the Lord.
[48:49] That should be our expectation. We
[48:52] should go not just to sit and stare, but
[48:55] we should go with a determination that
[48:57] we're going to yank it out of the
[48:59] preacher. We're because we have a need
[49:03] and God has the answer. Amen.
[49:07] We're going to receive the tithe and

[59:08] that you hold us close.
[59:13] We're not always
[59:14] submitted. We're not always yielding to
[59:18] you. Sometimes we struggle from your
[59:21] arms. But Lord, we're so thankful
[59:23] tonight that you don't give
[59:25] up. You don't change your mind about
[59:28] us. You have a way of drawing us, wooing
[59:33] us, and calling us. the deep that calls
[59:36] to the deep, bringing us right back
[59:40] every time to papa's
[59:43] care. Lord, we are preparing our hearts
[59:45] tonight to hear your word and we love
[59:49] our brother and we have confidence that
[59:51] you've called him, but we're looking
[59:53] beyond him
[59:55] tonight. We're looking to the living
[59:58] word. Would you come and walk among us
[1:00:00] this evening? Speak to us. Talk to us,
[1:00:04] Lord.
[1:00:06] Doesn't matter to us whether you
[1:00:08] whisper or whether you
[1:00:10] shout. We just want to know your voice.
[1:00:14] We want to discern your heart and we
[1:00:17] want to spend time in fellowship with
[1:00:20] you this evening. Lord, bless every
[1:00:23] person for their sacrifice to be here
[1:00:25] tonight. And we give you all the glory
[1:00:28] and the honor and the praise for it's in
[1:00:30] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We
[1:00:33] thank you. Would you give the Lord
[1:00:34] another hand clap of
[1:00:37] praise? Clap your hands. The Bible said,
[1:00:40] "All ye people shout unto God with a
[1:00:46] voice of
[1:00:48] [Music]
[1:00:54] [Music]
[1:00:58] triumph. Be seated just a moment.
[1:01:04] Um, he's good all the time.
[1:01:08] He's all the time good, isn't he? Need
[1:01:10] to do just a few things quickly. You
[1:01:13] don't believe that it can be quickly if
[1:01:14] I'm involved, but it really can. Uh, I
[1:01:18] want to say to Pastor David Templeton
[1:01:20] and his wife and the church family
[1:01:22] there, how much I know brother Greley's
[1:01:24] already uh mentioned it, but I want them
[1:01:27] to know how much we appreciate them
[1:01:28] being here this evening. from the bottom
[1:01:30] of our hearts. We appreciate it. Some of
[1:01:33] you heard how this uh uh tonight sort of
[1:01:35] came to be. Uh we have first weekend
[1:01:38] meetings every other month and we do
[1:01:41] that uh been doing it for a couple three
[1:01:43] years now and God has moved my my he has
[1:01:47] moved in those little special efforts
[1:01:50] and people have come from a lot of
[1:01:51] places to be with us brother. uh somehow
[1:01:56] they and and uh every church is
[1:01:58] sovereign and we don't have to plan our
[1:02:00] schedule around the valley and the
[1:02:02] valley doesn't we know all that but oh
[1:02:05] what a wonderful sweet spirit of
[1:02:09] fellowship and unity and brotherhood
[1:02:13] um when we were giving our apologies for
[1:02:16] not being able to be there with them
[1:02:17] this weekend for their meetings with
[1:02:19] brother Dwayne
[1:02:21] um I just thought well I'll put my toe
[1:02:23] in the
[1:02:24] you know, you never know. And I said,
[1:02:26] "Well, I I guess you could share him
[1:02:28] with us." And I waited. You know, you
[1:02:31] know, dot dot dot bubble bubble bubble.
[1:02:34] You know something's coming, but you're
[1:02:35] not sure what's coming. But, you know,
[1:02:37] an answer's on the way. There it was. He
[1:02:40] No hesitation, none whatsoever. And it
[1:02:44] it it left me speechless for a few
[1:02:46] minutes. That doesn't happen often
[1:02:48] either because we've never known that
[1:02:51] kind of fellowship and that kind of
[1:02:53] unity and brotherhood and we appreciate
[1:02:55] it so very much. Brother Dwayne will be
[1:02:57] preaching for us tonight. He'll be in
[1:02:59] the valley and I know they understand
[1:03:00] that we won't be able to be with him
[1:03:02] tomorrow but we'll catch the next
[1:03:03] meeting that you have. But isn't that
[1:03:05] just right?
[1:03:07] It's just right. It's just it's just
[1:03:10] right. But it's rare. And maybe you
[1:03:13] think it should just be and and I do,
[1:03:15] but but it hasn't. And for a brother to
[1:03:18] come and and to have that kind of a
[1:03:20] humility and uh and just change his
[1:03:23] plans and uh you you will still owe me a
[1:03:26] barbecue
[1:03:28] though. But just to change his plans,

[1:04:58] The

[1:05:21] The
[1:05:23] blood that gives me
[1:05:26] strength from

[1:06:22] lose his
[1:06:23] [Music]
[1:06:26] power. You know it
[1:06:30] to my doubt.
[1:06:34] And it
[1:06:35] calms all my
[1:06:39] [Music]
[1:06:41] fear.
[1:06:42] Jesus

[1:06:50] tears
[1:06:52] flood and kiss me

[1:07:11] power. Oh, for it
[1:07:14] reaches to the
[1:07:18] highest
[1:07:22] mountain. You'll know it
[1:07:25] flows to the
[1:07:29] lowest valley.
[1:07:34] Oh, the
[1:07:36] blood that gives me
[1:07:39] strength from
[1:07:42] day to
[1:07:44] day. He will
[1:07:48] never
[1:07:50] lose his power.

[1:09:24] life fell on you and fell on me. Aren't
[1:09:28] you glad? You're more than covered.
[1:09:30] You're more than covered. The living
[1:09:33] word is in you because of the life that
[1:09:35] was in that blood. Amen. Brother, you

[1:14:15] his spirit out on you this evening? I
[1:14:18] believe he is. He is. Yes. I'm not
[1:14:22] waiting on it. He already is pouring his
[1:14:25] spirit out. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:14:29] Praise the Lord. Amen. Thank y'all for
[1:14:32] the music. I tell you, it is so
[1:14:36] wonderful. Many, many, many, many people
[1:14:39] don't
[1:14:40] realize how necessary it is for music.
[1:14:46] Yes. Many people don't realize the
[1:14:49] ministry that comes with music. That's
[1:14:51] true. That's true. I maybe I've said it
[1:14:55] here before. You You look into
[1:14:57] scripture. When
[1:14:59] Saul was needing to be freed of the
[1:15:02] demon spirits,
[1:15:04] he didn't call for the prophet. Right.
[1:15:07] He didn't call for a minister.
[1:15:10] Who did he call for? A musician. Yes.
[1:15:14] That's right.
[1:15:16] He called for a musician to drive those
[1:15:18] evil spirits away. They were bombarding
[1:15:21] him. And it wasn't going to be a prophet
[1:15:23] at that time that took it away from him.
[1:15:25] It was going to be a musician and a
[1:15:27] psalmist that could drive those things
[1:15:29] away. So, it's important. It's very
[1:15:32] important. Amen. Could I invite you to
[1:15:34] turn with me to the book of Matthew this
[1:15:37] evening, chapter 5 and verse 6.
[1:15:42] I'll try to get right right to it and
[1:15:44] not take up too much of your time this
[1:15:46] evening.
[1:15:49] Um, I don't know if y'all are as nervous
[1:15:51] as I
[1:15:53] am. I'm glad y'all aren't because I'm
[1:15:56] nervous enough for for for all of you
[1:15:59] this evening.
[1:16:01] And it's not I'm not nervous for the
[1:16:04] word. I I recognize the office. That's
[1:16:07] right.
[1:16:10] I recognize when I'm standing in front
[1:16:13] of his bride, the bloodbought, purchased
[1:16:16] of God
[1:16:18] and and I recognize the awesomeness of
[1:16:21] of being in that position and I don't
[1:16:23] take it lightly this evening at all. The
[1:16:26] book of Matthew chapter 5 and verse 6.
[1:16:29] Let me ask you this question before I
[1:16:30] read this. How many want to be blessed?
[1:16:34] How many want to be blessed? Amen. All
[1:16:37] right. Well, this says, "Blessed
[1:16:41] are they which do hunger and thirst
[1:16:45] after righteousness,
[1:16:48] for they shall be filled."
[1:16:51] Not might be, not may be, not could be,
[1:16:56] but they shall be filled. Yes, sir. Also
[1:17:01] in Jeremiah
[1:17:02] 31:25, I'll read this and then you can
[1:17:05] you can have your seats. Jeremiah 31:25
[1:17:09] says, "For I have
[1:17:13] satiated satiated." We We'll talk about
[1:17:15] that word in a minute. Satiated the
[1:17:18] weary soul. Amen. And I have replenished
[1:17:23] every sorrowful soul. Yes, sir. Who did
[1:17:28] it?
[1:17:29] He did it. He did it. He's the one
[1:17:32] that's coming down with his presence.
[1:17:34] You were singing this song that I want
[1:17:36] to pour out my love on him, pour out my
[1:17:38] praise on him. But guess what? He wants
[1:17:40] to pour it all out on you. That's his
[1:17:43] desire is to express himself and express
[1:17:46] his love to you this evening. You You
[1:17:48] can have your seats in the presence of
[1:17:50] the Lord this evening. Amen.
[1:17:56] The word satiated
[1:18:00] comes from a a Hebrew word. I think I
[1:18:02] let him I gave that to him now. I don't
[1:18:04] know if I pronounced it correctly. Rava.
[1:18:07] Yes. Rava. It's a primitive root. Says
[1:18:11] to slake or to quench the thirst. And it
[1:18:15] says occasionally of other
[1:18:17] appetites. You know, sometimes people
[1:18:20] are hungry and thirsty, but they're
[1:18:23] hungering and thirsting for the wrong
[1:18:25] things.
[1:18:27] Their hunger and their thirst is not
[1:18:29] after righteousness. It's not after the
[1:18:31] word. is not after God. That's it. They
[1:18:34] slip another little letter in there, the
[1:18:36] letter L, and they hunger and thirst for
[1:18:39] the world. Uhhuh. Rather than for the
[1:18:42] word. That's it. It says, "Bathe,
[1:18:46] bathe, make drunk,
[1:18:49] to
[1:18:50] fill
[1:18:51] abundantly, satisfy, soak like water
[1:18:56] abundantly." That's what that word when
[1:18:58] it says for I have
[1:18:59] satiated. He He has taken out all of the
[1:19:03] weariness. He's removed all the weary. I
[1:19:06] I I was I was just thinking back. It was
[1:19:08] six months ago whenever we were here
[1:19:11] last with you. Six months ago in October
[1:19:15] of last year and and that was a very
[1:19:18] tough time.
[1:19:21] It was a a very trying time. And and
[1:19:24] Satan was trying his best to do
[1:19:26] everything he could to to bring to
[1:19:30] oppress the people and to bring the
[1:19:32] people down. That's right. But see,
[1:19:34] Jeremiah says, "For I have satiated
[1:19:37] satiated the weary soul. He wants to
[1:19:41] pour and he has. I have witnessed it.
[1:19:43] I've watched it. I've seen how he has
[1:19:45] come down and he has bathed this
[1:19:48] congregation with his love and his mercy
[1:19:51] and his grace to replenish every
[1:19:55] sorrowful Amen soul.
[1:19:59] I was I was I'd like to if I'd I'd like
[1:20:02] to speak to you on a thirsty soul. Yes.
[1:20:05] That would be the title of my my message
[1:20:07] this evening if I would give it a title
[1:20:09] of thirsty soul. and and um I I I've
[1:20:12] I've been doing a little study at home
[1:20:16] on uh on spiritual dehydration
[1:20:19] and uh and maybe maybe some of that will
[1:20:21] that'll come come through this evening.
[1:20:23] Um and I was I was looking up um on the
[1:20:26] worldvision.org og um talking about
[1:20:29] water crisis facts and um I just I was
[1:20:33] curious about it because I know you know
[1:20:34] back years ago there was you know
[1:20:37] billions and billions in this world that
[1:20:40] had no access to water. You know we we
[1:20:43] take it for granted. You know we we've
[1:20:44] got it we've got it right in front of us
[1:20:46] and and good water that you can drink.
[1:20:49] and and I' I've become a water snob. Um
[1:20:52] after coming down here and and and
[1:20:54] drinking this Callaway Blue, um that's
[1:20:57] what we drink at my house now. I I I I'm
[1:21:00] about ready to buy stock in Callaway
[1:21:02] Blue because we we buy it by the cases
[1:21:04] and we bring it in and it gets drunk. I
[1:21:06] used to bring in all sorts of other
[1:21:08] stuff that we won't talk about those
[1:21:09] other kind of waters. Um some of those
[1:21:11] they they just they left a bad taste in
[1:21:14] your mouth. Makes you thirsty. They did.
[1:21:16] Yeah. It didn't satisfy the thirst. um
[1:21:19] it left a bad taste, but as of as of
[1:21:21] right now that it says according to
[1:21:24] worldvision.org 703 million people,
[1:21:27] which is 1 in 11 people worldwide, lack
[1:21:30] access to clean water. Wow.
[1:21:34] 703 in the day that we're living in, 703
[1:21:37] million people, 2.2 billion people do
[1:21:42] not have access to safely managed
[1:21:44] drinking water services. Women and girls
[1:21:47] around the world spend an estimated 250
[1:21:51] million
[1:21:52] hours carrying water every day walking
[1:21:56] on average about 3.7 miles to haul on
[1:22:00] average 44 pounds of
[1:22:03] water. And more than a thousand children
[1:22:06] under the age of five die every day from
[1:22:10] diseases related to the lack of clean
[1:22:13] water, the lack of sanitation and
[1:22:16] hygiene.
[1:22:17] I I was just You say, "Well, what in the
[1:22:19] world does that have anything to do with
[1:22:21] with with with us and in in in church
[1:22:24] here here today?" Well, I I I look at
[1:22:27] things spiritually and naturally, right?
[1:22:30] Because these there's there's a lot of
[1:22:32] churches that you could go to and
[1:22:35] they're not giving clean, pure,
[1:22:39] unadulterated water from the word.
[1:22:43] It's contaminated. Brother Brother
[1:22:45] Brandham would talk about it as broken
[1:22:47] sistns and and he he would talk about
[1:22:50] the contamination that you find in many
[1:22:52] of the denominational churches. Well,
[1:22:54] can I bring it a little closer to home?
[1:22:56] Yeah,
[1:22:58] it's just not in denominational
[1:23:00] churches.
[1:23:02] There's contamination in those that
[1:23:05] would be so-called message believing
[1:23:08] churches because they put in things that
[1:23:11] wasn't meant to be put in.
[1:23:14] They don't just leave it alone. Say it
[1:23:16] the way he said it. Say it the way the
[1:23:18] word says it. Don't add to. Don't take
[1:23:21] away from. Just leave it alone. But so
[1:23:24] many of them contaminate it nowadays.
[1:23:26] And people are going thinking that
[1:23:29] they're taking a good drink of water
[1:23:34] and they go into that service and they
[1:23:37] sit there in that environment and
[1:23:39] they're thinking that they're being fed
[1:23:41] good, clean water.
[1:23:45] And then later they they come to find
[1:23:47] out it wasn't clean at all.
[1:23:49] It poisoned me. the things that they
[1:23:52] were taking in into their bodies, it was
[1:23:54] poisoning their body and it wasn't
[1:23:57] satiating them. It wasn't bathing them.
[1:24:01] You know, did you did you know I didn't
[1:24:02] know this until just a few weeks ago
[1:24:05] whenever I was doing some
[1:24:07] studying that if you spend enough time
[1:24:11] in
[1:24:12] saltwater, if you people that like to go
[1:24:14] and and they want to be at the ocean or
[1:24:16] be in a saltwater pool or whatever, if
[1:24:18] you spend too much time in saltwater,
[1:24:21] just being in that water will dehydrate
[1:24:23] you. Will, right? I didn't know that.
[1:24:26] I'm thinking you're in water. Water
[1:24:28] hydrates.
[1:24:29] Not all water hydrates, though. That's
[1:24:31] right. If you're in salt water for too
[1:24:33] long, it can cause you to become
[1:24:36] dehydrated. And I and and again, I I was
[1:24:39] just thinking the wrong environment. We
[1:24:42] place oursel in the wrong environment.
[1:24:46] And if we're not careful, the things
[1:24:48] that we have subjected oursel to, the
[1:24:51] locations that we have put oursel in,
[1:24:54] if you stay in that environment too
[1:24:56] long, what does it do? It becomes a part
[1:24:59] of you. It it comes inside of you. You
[1:25:02] know, I I I've I've I've dealt with for
[1:25:03] for years, I've dealt with with really
[1:25:05] dry skin, you know, by the my my legs,
[1:25:08] my back deals deal deals with really dry
[1:25:10] skin. I was talking with with my my
[1:25:12] doctor a few weeks ago, and he was I was
[1:25:16] asking him, you know, what what can I do
[1:25:17] for it? You know, I've I've tried
[1:25:18] different types of creams and and those
[1:25:21] type things, and everybody tells you
[1:25:23] this is the best and that's the best.
[1:25:24] And he said, he said, "I myself deal
[1:25:27] with it." He said, "I had to go to a a
[1:25:29] dermatologist." And a dermatologist was
[1:25:31] explaining to him. He said, "Now,
[1:25:32] whenever you go take a, you know, take
[1:25:34] your shower, whatever." And he said,
[1:25:36] "Then after you get out of the shower,"
[1:25:37] he said, "pour a tub of water." He said,
[1:25:40] "Now, don't put any salts in it. Don't
[1:25:42] put any type of soaps in it. Just pour a
[1:25:44] tub of tub of water. That's a little bit
[1:25:46] warmer than room temperature." Room
[1:25:48] temperature is kind of cool. if that's
[1:25:49] 75 degrees or something like that. It's
[1:25:51] a little cool to be in, but you know,
[1:25:53] just tepid water, he said, and sit in
[1:25:55] that water for about 20 minutes, he
[1:25:58] says, and then once you get out of that
[1:26:00] water, he said, your body will absorb
[1:26:02] from being in that water. Interesting.
[1:26:04] It will it will absorb into your skin.
[1:26:06] And then once you get out of that, he
[1:26:08] said, then apply some type of good oily
[1:26:11] type of lotion that will help hold that
[1:26:14] moisture in. And again, I'm sitting
[1:26:16] there in his office and I'm thinking, my
[1:26:19] goodness, so you're telling me that I
[1:26:21] need to be in good, clean, unadulterated
[1:26:25] water,
[1:26:27] and if I can dwell in that spot, not any
[1:26:31] additives into it, and I can just stay
[1:26:34] in that presence,
[1:26:36] then it will absorb into me. And then I
[1:26:40] apply the oil of the Holy Ghost on me
[1:26:43] and that seals that moisture in and I
[1:26:46] don't get all dry.
[1:26:50] I don't want to get all dried it out and
[1:26:52] get all cracked open and everything. I
[1:26:55] want to be pliable. I want to be able to
[1:26:58] be moved by the Holy Spirit.
[1:27:02] Jesus.
[1:27:03] Did you know that civilizations have
[1:27:06] fought battles? Yes. They fought wars
[1:27:10] over the availability of
[1:27:13] water. But go back to in in the book of
[1:27:16] Matthew, the the first scripture, we
[1:27:17] said, "Blessed are they which do hunger
[1:27:19] and thirst after righteousness." Well,
[1:27:21] if you're going to say hunger and thirst
[1:27:23] after righteousness, then we we need to
[1:27:25] define righteousness. That's right. It's
[1:27:29] it's good to say you need to hunger and
[1:27:30] thirst after something, but if you don't
[1:27:32] define what that is and you just throw
[1:27:34] out a word to some, they may know what
[1:27:37] righteousness is, but maybe there's
[1:27:39] others here. Maybe there's some maybe
[1:27:40] this is just for some younger children
[1:27:42] that that may not know some of the
[1:27:44] things that you know. So, we could
[1:27:46] define righteousness by by our
[1:27:49] understanding and our standards is
[1:27:50] defined as the quality of being morally
[1:27:53] true and justifiable. And the
[1:27:56] justification is made according to the
[1:27:57] conformity of behavior with a regulation
[1:28:01] or a constitution um in the context of a
[1:28:04] nation. That's that's how that works.
[1:28:06] But in a spiritual
[1:28:07] meaning, see that was just the natural
[1:28:10] side of it. But the spiritual side of
[1:28:11] it, righteousness is the quality of
[1:28:14] being right in the eyes of God. Yes.
[1:28:18] Amen. That's what righteousness is. And
[1:28:21] that's how we become blessed. Yes. When
[1:28:24] we hunger and we thirst to be right in
[1:28:28] his eyes,
[1:28:30] that includes your character, right? Or
[1:28:33] your nature. Yes. Your conscience. Yes.
[1:28:36] Or your attitude.
[1:28:38] It it includes your conduct, right?
[1:28:41] Which is your actions. Bring it on down.
[1:28:43] And it includes the word, the commands
[1:28:46] of the word. Righteousness is based upon
[1:28:50] God's standard, right? It is not based
[1:28:52] upon man's standard. Righteousness is
[1:28:56] only in accordance with God's standard.
[1:28:58] And he's given us his standard. And he's
[1:29:00] given us a prophet in this day to come
[1:29:03] and reinforce that standard and explain
[1:29:05] it a little bit deeper to some of us. I
[1:29:07] I I needed things broken down a little
[1:29:10] bit more to me. Sometimes when I read in
[1:29:12] in the King James, I I get a little
[1:29:14] confused with it, but I could I could
[1:29:16] understand a hillbilly from Kentucky, as
[1:29:19] he would say it. I could I could
[1:29:21] understand the way he would break it
[1:29:22] down and it made it made it very clear
[1:29:24] to me.
[1:29:26] Oh, I my
[1:29:31] head's I don't use too many handwritten
[1:29:34] notes, but sometimes I do because
[1:29:36] something comes to you and you say, I
[1:29:37] got to write that down or I'll forget
[1:29:38] it.
[1:29:40] I I when I was re studying about
[1:29:43] dehydration, I came across there's
[1:29:45] there's many different signs of
[1:29:47] dehydration, but these intrigued me
[1:29:49] because it was said it was subtle signs
[1:29:52] and it was just four of them that I
[1:29:53] wrote down uh among the many um and
[1:29:56] and maybe you might this might apply to
[1:30:00] you spiritually. Rising irritation
[1:30:03] levels
[1:30:15] [Music]
[1:30:18] Rising irritation levels is a subtle
[1:30:22] sign of
[1:30:24] dehydration. Increased
[1:30:28] fatigue. Again, I'm I'm I'm I'm taking
[1:30:31] natural to type spiritual. That's right.
[1:30:34] Dizziness. You know, some people are
[1:30:36] unsteady.
[1:30:38] They're unsteady in their ways.
[1:30:40] Double-minded. I think James said that,
[1:30:43] right? A double-minded man is unstable
[1:30:46] in all his ways.
[1:30:49] And another one was they they have
[1:30:50] trouble paying attention.
[1:30:53] But I know that nobody's spiritually
[1:30:55] dehydrated here. So, um we don't y'all
[1:30:58] don't have to worry about rising
[1:30:59] irritation levels and troubles paying
[1:31:02] attention. So, um, we'll move along
[1:31:04] with, um, out of the book of Romans, um,
[1:31:08] in, uh, and if you'd allow me, out of
[1:31:10] the amplified, um, in the book of
[1:31:12] Romans, chapter 4, um, verses 3-6 says,
[1:31:16] "For what does the scriptures
[1:31:18] say?" Abraham believed in or trusted and
[1:31:21] relied on God, and it was credited to
[1:31:24] his account as righteousness or right
[1:31:28] living or right standing with God.
[1:31:31] Amen. Now, to a laborer, his wages are
[1:31:35] not credited as a favor or a gift. In
[1:31:38] other words, he's getting what he what
[1:31:40] he earned. He's getting what he worked
[1:31:42] for, but as an it's it's given as an
[1:31:44] obligation or something that's owed to
[1:31:46] him. But to the one who does not work,
[1:31:49] and we know that it's not by works.
[1:31:52] To the one who does not work, that is
[1:31:54] the one who does not try to earn his
[1:31:57] salvation by doing good, right? but
[1:32:00] believes and completely trusts in him
[1:32:03] who justifies the ungodly. His faith is
[1:32:06] credited to him as righteousness or as
[1:32:10] right standing with God. And in this
[1:32:12] same way, David speaks of the blessing
[1:32:16] on the one to whom God credits
[1:32:18] righteousness apart from works. Yes,
[1:32:21] sir. I'm so thankful that it's not by my
[1:32:24] works. It will never be by my works. It
[1:32:27] will never be by something that I did
[1:32:29] that was good. No. The only way that I
[1:32:33] have received righteousness and that I
[1:32:34] can be clothed in his righteousness is
[1:32:37] because of his mercy and his grace. And
[1:32:40] he extends that to me. And he extends
[1:32:43] that to you this evening. And blessed
[1:32:46] are they
[1:32:48] that do hunger and thirst
[1:32:51] after his righteousness,
[1:32:54] not after our good works.
[1:32:56] We need to be striving for his
[1:32:59] righteousness to live the way he wants
[1:33:02] us to live. Amen. It's vitally
[1:33:04] important. I've got something in my eye.
[1:33:06] Vitally important of what we're
[1:33:08] thirsting for. Yes, sir. And you will
[1:33:11] never
[1:33:12] quench. You'll never quench a holy
[1:33:14] thirst
[1:33:16] with unholy living.
[1:33:21] You won't.
[1:33:23] Ask me how I know. Yeah.
[1:33:27] cuz I tried. Been there, done that. I
[1:33:30] tried in in in in my teenage
[1:33:32] years. I tried to go all sorts of
[1:33:35] different ways. And later down in in
[1:33:38] life, I was talking to my mom and dad
[1:33:40] one day and some different things had
[1:33:41] went on and and and my dad told me and
[1:33:44] my mom did too. She's like, "You don't
[1:33:46] know how many nights that we stayed up
[1:33:48] and we prayed." Because I was living at
[1:33:50] home till I was about 21,
[1:33:53] you know, and I I I was I was my own
[1:33:56] person, you know, 18 years old. I'm I'm
[1:33:59] I'm going to do I' I'd been in the
[1:34:01] military and I thought that I knew
[1:34:04] everything there was to know, you know,
[1:34:08] and I I was I was running I was running
[1:34:11] from the true desire that God had placed
[1:34:14] in my heart and in my life. And what I
[1:34:16] was trying to do is I was trying to fill
[1:34:18] that with something else. See, there was
[1:34:21] a longing. Brother Brown would talk
[1:34:22] about a deep that calleth to the deep.
[1:34:25] And we that's in in the notes somewhere
[1:34:27] here. But he would he would refer to a
[1:34:29] deep call into the deep. So see there
[1:34:31] was there's something that was inside of
[1:34:33] me that was calling out to him and what
[1:34:36] I was doing I was blocking that and I
[1:34:38] was trying to fill it with all sorts of
[1:34:40] other hobbies. That's right. See I I I I
[1:34:42] I started playing pool, you know, and I
[1:34:47] got really good at playing pool until I
[1:34:50] realized that that was pulling me away
[1:34:53] from Christ. And he fi finally God
[1:34:56] showed me one day. He said, "You've
[1:34:57] you've got to put that down." I I had
[1:34:59] over $1,000 in in QST sticks because I I
[1:35:02] I played often. I would go at that time
[1:35:06] that time I was 19, 20 years old. I
[1:35:08] would come home from work and I would go
[1:35:10] to the pool hall and I played. And I
[1:35:13] finally I gave it away. whenever he he
[1:35:15] started dealing with my heart and he's
[1:35:17] he he was showing me that what you're
[1:35:20] trying to do you're you're trying to
[1:35:21] fill a void that I've put in you see he
[1:35:25] he places that desire inside of you but
[1:35:29] what we have to do is we got to make
[1:35:31] sure that we fill it with him and not
[1:35:34] fill it with the things of the world too
[1:35:36] many people want to go to a bottle they
[1:35:39] want to go to a pill that and you say oh
[1:35:42] I don't I don't smoke I don't drink I I
[1:35:45] don't do all these things, but what
[1:35:47] about your other hobbies?
[1:35:49] Are you Are you putting so much time?
[1:35:51] Are you putting equal time at least
[1:35:53] equal time? I mean I mean some some some
[1:35:57] people want to want to want to go and
[1:35:58] they want to go golfing all the time. If
[1:36:01] you want to go golfing, that's that's
[1:36:02] fine. I'm I'm not telling you you can't
[1:36:04] go golfing. But some people they have a
[1:36:06] whole lot of different activities that
[1:36:08] they want to devote their time to. And
[1:36:10] really, if you'd stop and think about
[1:36:12] it, all you are doing, you're trying to
[1:36:14] satisfy through a natural
[1:36:19] satisfy spiritual longing and a
[1:36:21] spiritual desire that God placed in you.
[1:36:25] And what he wants you to do is yield
[1:36:26] yourself completely to him and let him
[1:36:30] fill your heart. Let him fill your body.
[1:36:33] Let him take up your time. it. I I I I
[1:36:36] just heard brother brother Brown say the
[1:36:38] other day he was talking about you know
[1:36:39] a lot of times people say he's really
[1:36:41] hard on the women you know the women of
[1:36:42] this and you know the women he's he was
[1:36:44] talking I don't even know what message I
[1:36:45] was listen to now. Um if I think a
[1:36:49] minute I might come up with it but
[1:36:50] anyway he was he was talking about um
[1:36:52] you know the the the women they don't
[1:36:54] need he said unless you have to go work
[1:36:57] he said it's better for you to be at
[1:36:59] home. Yes. He said that that's where God
[1:37:02] God called you to your home and and to
[1:37:04] your children. But then he jumped in on
[1:37:08] the men. He said, "And you men that want
[1:37:10] to go in all the to these lodges
[1:37:15] instead of going home to your family,
[1:37:19] you want you've got all these other
[1:37:20] things that you're wanting to do in the
[1:37:22] evening. You're leaving your wife at
[1:37:23] home with the kids. Yeah. He said,
[1:37:26] "That's not the way it's supposed to
[1:37:27] be." That's right.
[1:37:29] That's it. That ain't in my notes.
[1:37:33] Anyhow,
[1:37:34] but he was he hit them. He said, "You
[1:37:36] don't you shouldn't be doing that,
[1:37:38] right? You should be at home with your
[1:37:40] family."
[1:37:42] You got We have obligations. We've I
[1:37:44] have to go to work, but whenever I get
[1:37:46] off of work, guess where I want to be? I
[1:37:48] want to be at home. I want to be at home
[1:37:51] with my family. I don't want to take
[1:37:53] every evening of my week and and and
[1:37:56] book it up with something else. go out
[1:37:57] with the guys to do this and go out and
[1:37:59] and obligate myself here to do that and
[1:38:01] I I got this hobby that I want to go do
[1:38:03] and that thing I want to go. No, I want
[1:38:05] to go home to be where I'm supposed to
[1:38:08] be.
[1:38:10] If God has called my wife to be at home
[1:38:14] with my children to raise my family,
[1:38:16] then he has called me as well to be in
[1:38:19] my place. Because if the man is not in
[1:38:22] his place, guess what? The family is out
[1:38:25] of place.
[1:38:26] Amen.
[1:38:36] That was nowhere in in my notes.
[1:38:41] That came from him.
[1:38:44] You you you do with it what you want. I
[1:38:46] suggest you take it.
[1:38:49] Amen. Yes. In the message of the sixth
[1:38:51] seal
[1:38:54] 1963, brother brother Brown said, "What
[1:38:57] makes a man do
[1:38:58] wrong?" What makes him You got to What
[1:39:01] makes him drink and carry on or a woman
[1:39:04] do wrong is because she's there there's
[1:39:07] something in her thirsting.
[1:39:11] There's something in him thirsting. And
[1:39:12] they're they're trying to quench that
[1:39:14] holy thirst with the things of the
[1:39:17] world.
[1:39:19] When God ought to be that quench,
[1:39:25] he should be that one that quenches. He
[1:39:28] made you that way to thirst. That's the
[1:39:31] reason you thirst for something. God
[1:39:33] made you that way so you would turn that
[1:39:35] holy thirst to him. See, but when you
[1:39:39] try to quench that thirst, and he says,
[1:39:42] "How dare
[1:39:44] anybody to do that?" You have no right
[1:39:47] to do that. to try to quench that holy
[1:39:49] thirst that you thirst for something and
[1:39:51] then you turn it to the world, try to
[1:39:55] satisfy it with the world. You can't do
[1:39:56] it. He said there's only one thing that
[1:39:59] will fill that up and that's God and he
[1:40:04] made you that way.
[1:40:07] That's good. Well, that was all of that
[1:40:09] one. Sorry, I thought I had had more of
[1:40:12] that one. But he's the one who made you
[1:40:14] that way. He placed a desire inside of
[1:40:17] you and that that desire is for him.
[1:40:23] He He wants to pour his love out on you.
[1:40:26] Amen. He wants to have constant
[1:40:29] communion with you. That's right. But if
[1:40:33] you don't give him the time a day,
[1:40:36] if you filled up your day with
[1:40:38] everything else and you don't have you
[1:40:40] you don't have any time in your schedule
[1:40:43] to sit down, right, read his word and
[1:40:47] listen to him.
[1:40:50] Yes, sir. Why Why have we gotten away
[1:40:53] from from reading our Bible every
[1:40:56] day?
[1:40:58] Brother Brham said, "If you want to get
[1:40:59] closer to God,
[1:41:02] there was two things. Read your Bible
[1:41:05] and pray.
[1:41:08] Do it every day. Read your Bible and
[1:41:11] pray." And you will draw closer to him.
[1:41:14] Because when you're in his
[1:41:17] presence, the demons can't stay in that
[1:41:19] presence.
[1:41:22] You can't have light and darkness at the
[1:41:24] same place. the truth. But see, we we
[1:41:27] come
[1:41:28] home and we just we open our home to all
[1:41:31] other types of things. Oh yeah. And we
[1:41:34] don't sit down and go back to the family
[1:41:37] altar. That's right. We don't take time
[1:41:40] to read our Bible together. That's true.
[1:41:42] Anyway, we have so many other
[1:41:45] obligations that we've got to make sure
[1:41:47] that we do this and we've got to go here
[1:41:48] and we've got this to do and that to do
[1:41:50] and all these other things to do. And
[1:41:52] all those things are doing is taking
[1:41:53] your time away from him
[1:41:57] and is not getting you any closer to
[1:42:00] Christ at all. Facebook don't get you
[1:42:04] closer to God. That's right. Instagram
[1:42:07] don't get you closer to God.
[1:42:11] YouTube don't get you closer to God. I'm
[1:42:15] sorry.
[1:42:17] Reading our Bible is what draws us
[1:42:20] closer to him. That's right. That's what
[1:42:22] he said. Spending time in the word. 1
[1:42:24] Corinthians chapter 10 verse
[1:42:27] 21. This is pretty stout.
[1:42:31] It is. Ye
[1:42:35] cannot you
[1:42:37] cannot drink the cup of the
[1:42:41] Lord and the cup of devils.
[1:42:46] You cannot be partakers of the Lord's
[1:42:49] table
[1:42:50] and of the table of devils.
[1:42:55] You You can't You can't sit at his table
[1:42:58] and then go sit down with the table of
[1:43:00] the world.
[1:43:02] You can't drink from both cups.
[1:43:05] It don't work that way. You're You're
[1:43:07] either living for him. That's it. Or
[1:43:10] you're not. That's plain and simple.
[1:43:12] Either either your life is dedicated to
[1:43:14] him and you're living for him or you've
[1:43:17] turned from him and you've yielded
[1:43:20] yourself over to the things of the world
[1:43:22] and to the things that Satan would have
[1:43:24] you do and you've allowed it. People
[1:43:26] want to blame Satan. Satan made me do
[1:43:28] this. Satan made me do that. Don't give
[1:43:31] him that credit.
[1:43:33] No, you allowed it.
[1:43:36] You opened the door. That's right. You
[1:43:39] opened up the video.
[1:43:46] This little thing right here can be used
[1:43:49] for good.
[1:43:51] But guess what?
[1:43:54] It's connected to a whole lot of evil if
[1:43:56] you're not careful.
[1:43:59] A lot of evil that's that's right there
[1:44:02] in the palm of your hand. And if you
[1:44:05] don't have the Holy Spirit, a lot of it.
[1:44:09] That's exactly right. Yes, sir. to
[1:44:11] control you.
[1:44:15] You will get drawn in and it you you'll
[1:44:18] go down like like the guys that work
[1:44:20] there was like I was I was on a YouTube
[1:44:22] rabbit hole, you know, watching watching
[1:44:25] this and and then it went from this to
[1:44:27] that and you're and and you your your
[1:44:29] mind starts justifying. Well, that
[1:44:30] wasn't that bad.
[1:44:33] Oh, they only used one word that was
[1:44:36] kind of crass.
[1:44:39] And so that one word leads to two words
[1:44:44] and then all of a sudden you you you
[1:44:45] become you you you become callous to it.
[1:44:48] That is true. And and then then you're
[1:44:51] just sitting there and and and any
[1:44:53] little thing that comes on and and it
[1:44:55] doesn't even affect you anymore. And and
[1:44:57] people will say, "Well, I didn't even
[1:44:58] hear them say that." I'm like, "I did."
[1:45:00] Your spirit, your soul did. Yes, it it
[1:45:03] does. And it hurts. Even my guys at
[1:45:06] work, they they know my stand and I know
[1:45:09] that they I and I don't ask them to to
[1:45:12] live to my standard, but they know how I
[1:45:14] believe and they know my stand. And
[1:45:16] whenever they're around me, they don't
[1:45:19] use that type of language. Every so
[1:45:21] often they'll slip, but almost almost
[1:45:23] without in in just a moment if they they
[1:45:26] slip up, they'll I'm sorry. I didn't I
[1:45:28] didn't mean to to to say that in front
[1:45:30] of you because they know that's that's
[1:45:32] not who I am. I don't use that kind of
[1:45:34] language and I don't like to be around
[1:45:36] that kind of language. That's not the
[1:45:38] life that I live. And so whenever
[1:45:41] whenever those words are are spoken,
[1:45:43] it's a it it jabs. It I mean it cuts me,
[1:45:46] you know, especially when when somebody
[1:45:48] takes the Lord's name in vain. And I'm
[1:45:51] I'm like it just it hurts me so bad.
[1:45:54] We've actually asked my my mom told a
[1:45:57] customer one time. They were they were
[1:45:58] in our office and at at our front desk
[1:46:01] and they were talking with somebody else
[1:46:02] and they were they were just using all
[1:46:05] types of language. And she got out of
[1:46:06] her office and walked up there and she
[1:46:08] said, "I'm sorry. I'm going to ask you
[1:46:09] to to refrain from from talking that
[1:46:12] way." She said, "That's not how we we
[1:46:15] don't talk talk with that language."
[1:46:17] That's right. And they apologized and
[1:46:20] they wrapped up their business and left.
[1:46:22] That's it. We don't have we don't we
[1:46:24] don't have to live in that environment.
[1:46:27] That's right. I I don't want to subject
[1:46:29] myself to the salt water of this world
[1:46:33] and become dehydrated and all cracked up
[1:46:35] and everything and not allow the Holy
[1:46:37] Ghost to be able to flow through me.
[1:46:41] I I want to stay in his presence.
[1:46:45] I I don't want to I don't want to be
[1:46:47] tempted by the by the little things of
[1:46:49] the world that tries to creep in.
[1:46:53] Tries to creep in. I I was I was sharing
[1:46:56] an
[1:46:57] analogy the other day and I I I was
[1:46:59] sharing it uh this this afternoon um
[1:47:02] with brother Steve and sister Stacy. Um
[1:47:05] people people want to say that they want
[1:47:08] to come to you and they they'll say,
[1:47:09] "Well, well, why is it
[1:47:12] that these people do such and such and
[1:47:15] they live a life this way, but yet they
[1:47:17] still claim that they're Holy Ghost
[1:47:20] filled and they claim that they're
[1:47:21] Christians. They claim that they're
[1:47:22] going to be in heaven. And I say, "I
[1:47:24] don't know.
[1:47:26] I don't know. I I can't answer for
[1:47:28] them."
[1:47:30] But see, the thing is is I'm not asked
[1:47:33] to try to match my life and my
[1:47:36] experience
[1:47:38] with the way they live their life.
[1:47:43] I'm called to match my life
[1:47:48] with his life.
[1:47:52] That's the only place I'm supposed to
[1:47:54] make my comparison.
[1:47:56] I don't care if everybody was at at the
[1:48:00] church that I go to. If everybody came
[1:48:01] in and they were living like the world,
[1:48:04] that does not mean that I can say, "Oh,
[1:48:06] they're living like the world. I should
[1:48:08] live like the world." No, I'm not
[1:48:11] comparing myself to them.
[1:48:14] I'm comparing myself to the word, not to
[1:48:18] things of the world. And I I gave this I
[1:48:20] gave this analogy and I I said, you
[1:48:22] know, I said if you if if let's say that
[1:48:25] on the this side of this line, I'm safe.
[1:48:27] Uhhuh.
[1:48:29] But just on the other side of this line
[1:48:31] right here, there's a whole lot of
[1:48:34] rattlesnakes. We hear you. Come on.
[1:48:38] Am I going to stay right here? Or am I
[1:48:42] going to move as far away from that as I
[1:48:44] can?
[1:48:46] I don't like snakes.
[1:48:48] I'm going to go as I'm going to go to
[1:48:49] that wall or I'm going to go down the
[1:48:50] steps and go out the building because I
[1:48:52] don't want to be next to the snakes.
[1:48:55] But see, so many people are okay living
[1:48:57] as close as they can to those snakes.
[1:49:02] And see, the the thing is is if you say,
[1:49:05] "Well, it's all right if I if I just do
[1:49:08] this little thing."
[1:49:10] And so I'm like, okay, in my mind I'm
[1:49:12] thinking of it's it's all right to to
[1:49:14] get bitten by one snake.
[1:49:21] You're you're okay with getting bitten
[1:49:23] by one snake. Well, how many snakes are
[1:49:26] you okay getting bitten by? Well, see
[1:49:28] the problem with getting snake bit, when
[1:49:30] a snake bites you and it and puts its
[1:49:32] fangs in you, it injects venom. That's
[1:49:35] right. And see with what the venom does
[1:49:38] is it weakens your body. Yes, sir. And
[1:49:42] once your body becomes weak, you don't
[1:49:45] have as much strength to pull away.
[1:49:48] So now I've allowed myself to be bitten.
[1:49:51] That's right. I've allowed myself to be
[1:49:53] bitten by just trimming my hair a little
[1:49:56] bit.
[1:50:00] So, so that snake bit me and I was okay
[1:50:04] with that because I saw somebody else do
[1:50:06] it. And they still claim to be a
[1:50:08] Christian.
[1:50:10] I'm sorry. You you can you can correct
[1:50:13] me. Um, so so they get a little weak and
[1:50:17] then that second snake bites them.
[1:50:20] That's right.
[1:50:22] And it injects its venom. That's it. and
[1:50:26] it causes them to be a little bit more
[1:50:27] weak.
[1:50:30] And then the third snake bites and they
[1:50:33] become even weaker. And if they're not
[1:50:36] careful, they'll get to a place that
[1:50:38] they have zero strength to pull away and
[1:50:41] get themselves away from that
[1:50:43] environment anymore. And they have
[1:50:45] allowed themsel because of the proximity
[1:50:48] that they got to it. And they were okay.
[1:50:52] They wanted to live as close as they
[1:50:54] could to the world. No. Why would Why
[1:50:57] would you want to live as close as you
[1:50:59] can to venomous snakes, things that's
[1:51:01] going to take and drain your life from
[1:51:03] you? Cuz it's not getting you any closer
[1:51:06] to Christ.
[1:51:08] All it's doing is taking you further and
[1:51:10] further from him. So what we ought to do
[1:51:12] is get oursel as far away from it as we
[1:51:15] can and live as close as we can to the
[1:51:18] things that's in the scripture and what
[1:51:20] the word says the way the word teaches
[1:51:23] us to live and stop trying to compare
[1:51:26] ourselves to the things of the world.
[1:51:31] We should never compare ourselves to the
[1:51:32] things of the world ever.
[1:51:36] Where was I at?
[1:51:42] I'm trying to stay hydrated. It was good
[1:51:45] water,
[1:51:47] too. The book of
[1:51:49] Psalms, chapter
[1:51:55] 42. Chapter 42. This is during a time
[1:51:59] that that David had been pushed
[1:52:04] out. He was running. Abselum had
[1:52:09] was trying to overtake and proclaimed
[1:52:12] himself as king and he David had been
[1:52:14] pushed out of
[1:52:16] Jerusalem. And and I I I love this. I I
[1:52:20] love this scripture here in in in verse
[1:52:22] one. It says, "As the heart pantth
[1:52:27] after the waterbrook, so pantth my soul
[1:52:31] after thee, oh God." Yeah. You know, we
[1:52:33] we sing the little the little song, as
[1:52:37] the deer panteth for the water, so my
[1:52:42] soul longeth after thee. And it's so
[1:52:47] peaceful. And it's just a very sing
[1:52:49] song, peaceful
[1:52:50] [Music]
[1:52:52] song. You ever seen a
[1:52:54] deer that has been
[1:52:56] injured and it's seeking water? Oh, come
[1:52:59] on.
[1:53:01] It's not peaceful.
[1:53:05] It's not
[1:53:06] peaceful. And so what I picture in my
[1:53:10] mind as David is riding this that he has
[1:53:15] witnessed and he is equating
[1:53:18] himself as that deer that's been injured
[1:53:22] and he's like,
[1:53:23] "God, where are you? I need you. I've
[1:53:28] got to have water.
[1:53:30] It wasn't a peaceful. We We sing it in a
[1:53:32] peaceful sing song and little, you know,
[1:53:35] just a nice little melody. But he he was
[1:53:39] pant Oh, I've got that written down.
[1:53:45] Pant, the Hebrew verb
[1:53:50] arg conveys a deep intense longing. Oh,
[1:53:55] y'all got it up there. Or yearning.
[1:53:58] Often used in the context of a soul's
[1:54:01] desire for God, it suggests a strong
[1:54:05] emotional and spiritual thirst akin to
[1:54:09] the physical need for water. This term
[1:54:12] is used to express a profound desire for
[1:54:15] communion with the divine, reflecting a
[1:54:18] heart that seeks after God with
[1:54:21] earnestness and fervor. That's what the
[1:54:24] word panteth
[1:54:26] means. It wasn't just peaceful. Oh, it's
[1:54:30] a little deer that's just running
[1:54:31] around, running around. No, that deer
[1:54:34] was trying to save its life. Amen.
[1:54:38] It was struggling to live cuz it had
[1:54:41] gotten injured. And it's like it it
[1:54:43] knows if I can just get to the water
[1:54:48] cuz there's life.
[1:54:50] There's life when I get to that water.
[1:54:53] And it wasn't just it wasn't just
[1:54:55] prancing alone. No, it was running as
[1:54:58] hard as it could go to try to get to the
[1:55:01] source. That's right. But so many people
[1:55:04] nowadays, they want to do it like the
[1:55:06] little prancing around of the little
[1:55:09] deer. And if I find water, then I find
[1:55:13] water. I don't really think I need it,
[1:55:15] but maybe, you know, if if I come across
[1:55:18] a stream, I'll take a sip from it.
[1:55:22] You You don't have a longing yet, right?
[1:55:26] You don't have that longing, that true
[1:55:28] desire, and that understanding that if I
[1:55:30] don't, if I fail to get to the water, I
[1:55:33] die.
[1:55:38] If I don't make it to the water, I'm
[1:55:41] going to die. And if we don't make it to
[1:55:45] his water,
[1:55:47] we're going to die.
[1:55:50] That That's all there is to it. We're
[1:55:51] We're going to dry up completely. Yes.
[1:55:55] Oh, I got to go
[1:55:56] back. Verse two. My soul thirsteth for
[1:56:00] God.
[1:56:02] For the living God. He wasn't looking
[1:56:04] for a dead God. He wasn't looking for a
[1:56:06] God of yesterday. He's looking for a God
[1:56:08] who knows that is living today.
[1:56:12] The same God.
[1:56:14] The same God that lived in his day is
[1:56:18] the same God that lives today. And it's
[1:56:21] the same God that lives in you.
[1:56:27] See, the thing is, he wants to indwell
[1:56:29] within you.
[1:56:31] And the only way he can indwell within
[1:56:33] you is he has to change you, right? He
[1:56:36] has to take that old stony spirit out of
[1:56:39] you and replace it with his spirit. So
[1:56:41] then he can come in and indwell within
[1:56:44] you and can live and flow through you.
[1:56:46] But if you're all dried up,
[1:56:51] He's not going to be able to move
[1:56:53] through you.
[1:56:55] You know, whenever when people become
[1:56:57] dehydrated, some of the the first and I
[1:56:59] don't I don't have it written down, but
[1:57:00] I I know I've read it. Some of the the
[1:57:02] first things that that happens to them
[1:57:04] is their their kidneys shut down
[1:57:09] when you become dehydrated. Like, well,
[1:57:12] what does that have to do with anything?
[1:57:14] Well, you know what kidneys do?
[1:57:21] It's a filter.
[1:57:25] It filters out impurities.
[1:57:30] And see the thing is is whenever you
[1:57:31] become you start becoming spiritually
[1:57:33] dehydrated,
[1:57:35] your filter is not working proper.
[1:57:39] Right? It stops working and then you
[1:57:42] just allow everything to come in and
[1:57:45] it's not filtering the impurities, the
[1:57:48] things that are not like God
[1:57:51] because you haven't stayed in that
[1:57:54] presence in the water of the word. You
[1:57:58] haven't you haven't dwelt long enough in
[1:58:00] his presence. You've gotten
[1:58:02] dehydrated and your kidneys are shutting
[1:58:04] down your brother and you're not able to
[1:58:07] filter out the impurities anymore. Verse
[1:58:10] three, my tears have been my meat day
[1:58:12] and night while they continually say
[1:58:14] unto me, where is thy God? And he says,
[1:58:18] when I remember these things, I pour out
[1:58:20] my soul in me for I had gone with the
[1:58:23] multitude. He He's thinking back. He
[1:58:26] He's thinking back whenever he had went
[1:58:28] with the multitude. Sometimes people
[1:58:30] they get out of church but then they'll
[1:58:33] have memories. They man I I remember
[1:58:36] going I remember going to church and I
[1:58:38] remember how the Lord blessed and I
[1:58:40] remembered
[1:58:41] feeling his presence.
[1:58:44] But see they've gotten out of that
[1:58:45] presence now. They've allowed things to
[1:58:48] drive them out of his presence.
[1:58:51] But there's there's memory still there.
[1:58:54] Yeah. He said, "I I went with them to
[1:58:56] the house of God with a voice of joy and
[1:58:59] praise with a with a multitude that kept
[1:59:01] holy day.
[1:59:04] Why art thou cast down on my soul? And
[1:59:08] why art there out thou art thou
[1:59:10] disquited in me? Hope thou in God?" And
[1:59:14] I love this. For I shall yet praise him
[1:59:19] for the help of his countenance.
[1:59:22] By his help I'm not going to stop my
[1:59:26] praise. I will continue to praise him.
[1:59:29] He said, "Oh my God, my soul is cast
[1:59:31] down within me. Therefore will I
[1:59:33] remember thee from the land of Jordan,
[1:59:34] from the Hermonites, and from the hill
[1:59:36] of Mysar. Deep calleth unto deep at the
[1:59:40] noise of thy water spouts. All thy waves
[1:59:42] and thy billows are gone over me. Yet
[1:59:44] the Lord will command his loving
[1:59:47] kindness in the daytime and in the night
[1:59:50] so night his song shall be with me and
[1:59:53] my prayer unto the God of my life. I
[1:59:55] will say unto God, my rock, why hast
[1:59:58] thou forgotten me? Why go I mourning
[2:00:01] because of the oppression of the enemy?
[2:00:04] As with a sword in my bones, mine
[2:00:06] enemies reproach me while they say daily
[2:00:08] unto me, where is your God? People do
[2:00:13] that to you. They see that you're in a
[2:00:16] in in a maybe in a downtrodden state and
[2:00:18] they're like, "Where's this God you talk
[2:00:21] about?
[2:00:23] Where's this God you talk about? Why
[2:00:26] aren't thou cast down on my
[2:00:28] soul? Why art thou disquited within me?
[2:00:30] Hope thou in God, for I shall yet praise
[2:00:34] him who is the health of my countenance
[2:00:37] and my God."
[2:00:40] Brother Brandon would say in the message
[2:00:42] thirsting for life 1957 I offered wonder
[2:00:44] what David wrote that about until I
[2:00:46] learned about deers and back in that
[2:00:48] country in the other countries they have
[2:00:49] wolves and wild dogs they attack the
[2:00:51] deer because it's easy to pray for them
[2:00:54] that's a very good type of the devil you
[2:00:55] take a beautiful woman or handsome young
[2:00:57] man it's the very prey for the sins of
[2:00:59] this world just to pray a little
[2:01:02] innocent boy of 16 or 17 or a little
[2:01:04] girl just to pray to the devil to feast
[2:01:07] on Those wild dogs lay an in ambush. He
[2:01:10] said, "I've seen it in Africa. I've seen
[2:01:11] it in other countries. They they jump on
[2:01:13] these little deer. The first thing they
[2:01:14] do is try to break strings behind their
[2:01:16] legs. They can't run." He said, "We call
[2:01:19] it a a hunter's voice
[2:01:21] hamstring." He said, "He can't he can't
[2:01:24] grab them there. He grabs them by the
[2:01:26] throat, jerks the jugular vein loose,
[2:01:28] bleeds to death in just a moment. Then
[2:01:30] there's a flank in the deer. He'll run
[2:01:32] and jerk his teeth into that. if he's a
[2:01:34] big heavy dog and a small deer, he can
[2:01:36] throw that deer on the ground from the
[2:01:37] flank. He's got him in mid-center.
[2:01:39] Brother Brandham goes through through
[2:01:41] I'm not going to read read all of that.
[2:01:43] Um he's just talking about how the the
[2:01:45] dog does that. He's relating of how how
[2:01:47] that's how Satan does to us.
[2:01:52] He'll if he can't grab you here, he'll
[2:01:54] grab you another place. That is the
[2:01:57] truth. And maybe you're able to shake
[2:01:58] him off a little bit there, but if
[2:02:00] you're not strong enough to resist him
[2:02:04] because you haven't stayed in the
[2:02:07] presence of the Lord, and you've allowed
[2:02:09] those little snakes to come in and get a
[2:02:13] bite here and a bite there, and you've
[2:02:15] gotten weakened, your immune system is
[2:02:18] down,
[2:02:20] your kidneys aren't functioning, and
[2:02:21] you're able you're not able to push out
[2:02:23] the impurities, then he will overtake
[2:02:25] you.
[2:02:28] He said, "I've trailed him many times
[2:02:29] when they cross the creek and drink, run
[2:02:31] down the creek a little piece, run up on
[2:02:32] the hill, cross back and get some more
[2:02:34] water. He'll just keep running as long
[2:02:36] as he can get water. But if he doesn't
[2:02:38] get water, he will perish." That's what
[2:02:42] David said, "My soul's thirsting after
[2:02:44] you like the heart. I must have you,
[2:02:49] God, or perish." Have you ever gotten to
[2:02:52] that that place in your life? I have.
[2:02:55] You ever been to that spot and you you
[2:02:56] just say you you get to a place you God
[2:02:58] I have to have you.
[2:03:01] I need you, Lord. I've got to have you
[2:03:04] or I I realize I'm going to perish. I
[2:03:07] need your presence. I need you to pour
[2:03:11] your love out on me. Yes. He said, "And
[2:03:14] tonight this timber world has been
[2:03:16] bitten by the mad dogs of hell with all
[2:03:18] of this modern jazz music and dirty
[2:03:20] television programs, cracking jokes and
[2:03:23] so forth like that. You're mad dog bit.
[2:03:27] You're trying to quench that thirst with
[2:03:29] stagnated waters of the devil." He said,
[2:03:32] "May your heart become so thirsty that
[2:03:35] you must find Christ or die." Amen.
[2:03:39] He says, "The deer, as he thirsts for
[2:03:41] the waterbrook, so my soul thirst after
[2:03:42] thee, oh God, just take a drink from
[2:03:45] there. You'll never have to hear another
[2:03:47] sermon on morals or how to dress or how
[2:03:51] to act or how to conduct yourself."
[2:04:00] In the message life
[2:04:03] 1958, brother Brown says, "But when that
[2:04:05] little deer could get away, what happens
[2:04:08] when he go to bleeding? He he he goes to
[2:04:10] thirsting. He's got to find water." So
[2:04:12] what David said is the heart thirsts for
[2:04:14] the waterbrook. He's wounded. His life's
[2:04:16] bleeding out of him.
[2:04:19] Heart thirst for the waterbrook. My soul
[2:04:20] thirst after thee, oh God. That little
[2:04:22] deer can't find water, he's going to
[2:04:24] die. But if he can find water, he will
[2:04:27] survive it. He says, "Oh God, I would
[2:04:30] that every soul in here tonight would
[2:04:32] see the wounds of Satan."
[2:04:37] Now take inventory of yourself, each one
[2:04:39] see where he's wounded you. You say,
[2:04:42] "But brother Brandham, I I haven't gone
[2:04:44] all the way."
[2:04:46] Wounded. You're wounded. That's it.
[2:04:51] And that's what I'm saying.
[2:04:53] So many people have gotten they've
[2:04:56] gotten to a place that they're they're
[2:04:57] okay with yielding a little bit to the
[2:05:03] world. I'll I'll dress a little bit more
[2:05:06] like the
[2:05:08] world. I'll act a little bit more like
[2:05:10] the world. I'll go to the places that
[2:05:12] the world goes.
[2:05:17] still truth. You your body, your
[2:05:21] spiritual man is absorbing those things
[2:05:26] that you subject yourself to.
[2:05:29] And it's causing you to become
[2:05:32] dehydrated.
[2:05:34] It's causing you to become to a place
[2:05:37] that you can no longer enjoy the Holy
[2:05:41] Spirit flowing through you. That's his
[2:05:44] desire. He wants to live his life
[2:05:46] through you.
[2:05:53] He says, "Child, you're wounded. Does
[2:05:54] your soul thirst for
[2:05:56] God? Oh, God, I must find you or die. I
[2:05:59] can't go on without you, God. I I can't
[2:06:01] eat no more. I I won't sleep no more.
[2:06:03] I've got to have you, Lord, or perish."
[2:06:06] When the church gets to that condition,
[2:06:09] God will come back to his church.
[2:06:13] God will be to the church. Oh, as the
[2:06:15] heart thirst for the waterbrook, my soul
[2:06:19] thirst after thee, oh God. When we can
[2:06:22] get to that place, he will come to you.
[2:06:26] When we can set aside all of the natural
[2:06:29] desires, the natural affections for the
[2:06:32] things of this world, we can push all
[2:06:34] those things out and we can look to him
[2:06:37] completely and wholly, he will come to
[2:06:40] you. He is the only one that can satisfy
[2:06:44] a thirsty soul. Think the Episcopal
[2:06:47] sisters used to sing a song only Jesus
[2:06:50] can satisfy your soul. There ain't
[2:06:54] nothing in this world that can ever
[2:06:56] satisfy the soul because it was created
[2:07:00] for him. That's right.
[2:07:02] That's right. It was created for him.
[2:07:05] And whenever you try to go and inject
[2:07:07] other things and you try to put other
[2:07:09] things into that deep calling that he's
[2:07:13] placed in your life and you try to fill
[2:07:15] it up with the things of the world, all
[2:07:16] you're trying to do is block him. And
[2:07:19] that's and you are accomplishing that.
[2:07:22] You're you're blocking him from coming
[2:07:24] and taking his place inside of you.
[2:07:27] That's where he wants to be.
[2:07:30] You're created for that purpose.
[2:07:33] I was created to be a vessel for him to
[2:07:37] dwell in.
[2:07:40] I don't want my
[2:07:43] temple. This is the temple.
[2:07:46] I don't want to to damage my temple and
[2:07:49] and paint up my temple and put all this
[2:07:51] other stuff on my temple that that's not
[2:07:54] going to be pleasing to him cuz he's not
[2:07:56] going to come in and indwell in a place
[2:07:58] in a temple that is not designed. That's
[2:08:00] right. and not dressed according to his
[2:08:02] standard. That's right.
[2:08:05] The standard of righteousness.
[2:08:08] I want to be blessed. I want to hunger
[2:08:10] and I want to thirst after
[2:08:13] righteousness. I want to live my life
[2:08:15] the way he wants me to live.
[2:08:20] In the book of John chapter 4, it's the
[2:08:23] the story of Jesus talking with the
[2:08:25] woman at the well.
[2:08:28] It said Jesus 13 and 14 it says Jesus
[2:08:31] answered and said unto her whosoever
[2:08:34] drinkketh of this water it's talking
[2:08:37] about Jacob's
[2:08:38] well shall thirst again but whosoever
[2:08:42] drinkketh of the water I shall give
[2:08:46] shall I give him shall never thirst but
[2:08:49] the water that I shall give him shall be
[2:08:52] in him a well
[2:08:55] a well of water springing up into
[2:08:58] everlasting life. See, you you got to go
[2:09:00] back into the time that they lived in
[2:09:02] and think of a a well, it it wasn't they
[2:09:06] didn't have just water everywhere.
[2:09:08] The the the area that they live in was
[2:09:10] dry. Yes, sir.
[2:09:13] That's what David would talk about a as
[2:09:15] a thirst in a dry and a barren land
[2:09:17] where no water is. David said that, I
[2:09:20] believe. Um and and and so there they
[2:09:23] were accustomed to knowing that it was
[2:09:26] dry. It the the area that they lived in
[2:09:28] was dry and for for there to be a a well
[2:09:30] that was dug and they found water.
[2:09:32] That's why all the people went to that
[2:09:35] well to draw water cuz they didn't have
[2:09:38] it just down, you know, we we have water
[2:09:40] in the convenience of a a little bottle.
[2:09:42] You go back there and you turn a a
[2:09:43] faucet on. You know, I I I heard a story
[2:09:46] of of um I think it was Chuck Coulson
[2:09:49] that that told a story of he had brought
[2:09:52] some people over um from the Middle East
[2:09:54] years ago and and they they were in the
[2:09:56] United
[2:09:57] States and they had not been into a into
[2:10:01] a a a bathroom like how we'd have a
[2:10:04] bathroom. You have a um a faucet that
[2:10:06] you could just turn a faucet on and and
[2:10:08] the water would come out. And so they
[2:10:11] they were just amazed. And so he he went
[2:10:14] and he saw them that at the at the room
[2:10:16] and he they were in there trying to
[2:10:19] remove the
[2:10:22] faucet cuz they thought that it
[2:10:25] magically
[2:10:27] produced. They didn't have that where
[2:10:29] they were from. And so they were
[2:10:30] thinking if they could take that faucet
[2:10:32] with them,
[2:10:34] they had a source, think about it, of
[2:10:36] water,
[2:10:40] they would have they would definitely be
[2:10:41] they'd be drenched,
[2:10:45] but that was their mentality. They had
[2:10:47] never seen it.
[2:10:50] But even in that natural funny thing,
[2:10:55] they did not want to be separated from
[2:10:57] that water source. Right. They were
[2:10:59] like, "Where there? There's water here."
[2:11:02] Yes, sir. And I'm going back to a dry
[2:11:04] place.
[2:11:06] I want to take water with me. So, they
[2:11:09] were willing to try to remove the faucet
[2:11:11] cuz they thought it produced
[2:11:13] water. So many people today have water
[2:11:17] available to them.
[2:11:20] I'm talking spiritually now.
[2:11:26] and they just brush it off.
[2:11:31] There's good clean water and then they
[2:11:34] they'll go and and they're they're they
[2:11:36] allow themselves to go sit in an area
[2:11:38] that has stagnated water. Exactly right.
[2:11:42] I I don't want to to drink from stagnant
[2:11:46] water.
[2:11:48] I I don't want to drink from whenever I
[2:11:51] was in the military, we had a they they
[2:11:52] they would bring out water um and and
[2:11:55] for the for all the companies when we
[2:11:57] were out in the in the field was doing
[2:12:01] um whatever you want to call it
[2:12:02] maneuvers. Um but they would bring these
[2:12:06] they called them blivbits. It was just a
[2:12:08] big plastic thing or rubberized thing
[2:12:11] and it was full of water and it would
[2:12:14] sit out there and get
[2:12:17] hot and then we would we have to go and
[2:12:19] fill our cantens up with that hot water
[2:12:23] out of that rubber bivet and they wanted
[2:12:26] you to drink that and satisfy your
[2:12:29] thirst. It didn't satisfy my thirst. It
[2:12:33] tasted like plastic and I hated having
[2:12:36] to drink it. That's all the water they
[2:12:37] gave us, you know, so I had to drink it
[2:12:40] or I was going to be quite thirsty. But
[2:12:43] there are people
[2:12:44] today that will allow themselves to sit
[2:12:48] in a church that is completely stagnated
[2:12:53] and that is filled with wiggle tails,
[2:12:57] all the things that that that would come
[2:12:59] with stagnated water. You know, they say
[2:13:01] the I heard a phrase one time that said
[2:13:04] said that, you know, person got the Holy
[2:13:06] Ghost 30 years ago and they were sealed
[2:13:08] with the Holy Ghost, not a drafts run in
[2:13:10] and not a drafts run out.
[2:13:14] I'm sorry. It's become stagnated.
[2:13:18] It's become stagnated. It's got to be
[2:13:21] ever flowing. That Holy Spirit, you get
[2:13:25] one filling and many refillings. Yes,
[2:13:29] sir. It's not a oneand done.
[2:13:32] You've got to stay in his presence. You
[2:13:33] got to allow his life to continue
[2:13:37] continue to refill you over and over and
[2:13:41] over again.
[2:13:44] The empty soul, the empty soul has a
[2:13:50] thirst. The
[2:13:53] unbeliever does not seek after God.
[2:13:57] They don't have a thirst for
[2:14:00] God. And without God, they'll continue
[2:14:04] to seek after the things to satisfy and
[2:14:07] fill the emptiness that's within them.
[2:14:10] That's from an empty
[2:14:12] soul. Now, there's some that have a dry
[2:14:17] soul. A dry soul. Sometimes you you find
[2:14:20] yourself in a dry spot within your walk
[2:14:22] with God. Many times we find ourselves
[2:14:25] drinking too much of what the world has
[2:14:27] to offer.
[2:14:29] We've grown
[2:14:30] tired, fatigued mentally, physically due
[2:14:33] to the cares, the concerns of the world.
[2:14:36] And our focus has turned to withinstead
[2:14:42] of turning to God. The dry soul has
[2:14:45] tasted the
[2:14:47] goodness and desires that satisfaction
[2:14:50] again. The dry soul is like drinking
[2:14:53] salt water instead of fresh water. It
[2:14:56] gives a temporary
[2:14:57] satisfaction, but it's short-lived and
[2:14:59] you realize that you have to have more
[2:15:02] and more each time, but all it does is
[2:15:05] makes you more thirsty. But what you
[2:15:07] really need is the living water of God.
[2:15:12] That's the only thing that's going to
[2:15:13] satisfy the thirst that's been placed in
[2:15:17] our
[2:15:18] soul. In in in the message, thy loving
[2:15:20] kindness
[2:15:21] 1958, brother Ram says, "Now, what makes
[2:15:23] the fellow then thirst?" There's some
[2:15:25] reason for that. What makes people want
[2:15:27] to drink? What makes women want to be
[2:15:29] untrue, men untrue? What makes them
[2:15:31] desire to join churches that indulge in
[2:15:34] such as card playing, cigarette smoking,
[2:15:36] and all those kind of things like that?
[2:15:38] It's because God made a man to thirst
[2:15:40] and God made you up to thirst. That's
[2:15:43] why you do thirst. But he made you to
[2:15:46] thirst after him. That thirst was made
[2:15:49] in you to thirst after him. But the
[2:15:51] devil has perverted it and trying to
[2:15:53] make you be satisfied with trying to
[2:15:56] quench that blessed holy thing with sin.
[2:16:00] You have no
[2:16:01] right to quen to try to quench that
[2:16:04] blessed holy thirst with drinking and
[2:16:07] waiting in sin. He says, you remember
[2:16:09] that
[2:16:11] God made you to thirst after him in
[2:16:13] righteousness and the devil turns it
[2:16:14] around. So there's many thing he tries
[2:16:16] to quench it with. That's the reason you
[2:16:19] people don't go to church on Wednesday
[2:16:20] night no more. Y'all have it Tuesday
[2:16:23] night. Yeah. You'd
[2:16:27] rather I know y'all have church on
[2:16:29] Tuesday night, not Wednesday night. I
[2:16:31] wasn't trying to apply that. You'd
[2:16:32] rather stay home and look at some old
[2:16:35] dirty television of We Love Susy.
[2:16:38] He said, "Then you say you love God." No
[2:16:41] wonder. No wonder we can't have revival
[2:16:43] in America.
[2:16:45] And you got on your record machines them
[2:16:47] old dirty songs of Elvis Presley and all
[2:16:49] that other bunch of Tennessee trash over
[2:16:51] there.
[2:16:53] All shook up.
[2:16:56] You're going to be someday all shook up.
[2:16:59] Arthur Godfrey. Most people don't know
[2:17:00] who Arthur Godfrey is and all that Tommy
[2:17:03] Rot. See, the thing is the things that
[2:17:06] he was dealing with back then, in my
[2:17:08] opinion, pale
[2:17:10] pale in comparison to things that are
[2:17:14] out here now.
[2:17:16] The things that we subject ourselves to.
[2:17:18] That is the truth. The things that we so
[2:17:20] easily just turn it on the radio
[2:17:24] and you're like, "Oh, I just I'll just
[2:17:26] listen to that." And and there's no harm
[2:17:29] in in listening to to this country song
[2:17:31] or that country song. There's no harm in
[2:17:33] listening to this. Well, it's it's pop
[2:17:37] Christian or it's Christian
[2:17:41] rock. I don't I don't understand
[2:17:44] Christian rock. I don't I don't
[2:17:46] understand it. It's either it's
[2:17:48] Christian or it ain't Christian. It's
[2:17:50] either gospel. I heard heard one one uh
[2:17:54] one person, it was I think it was um
[2:17:55] Donnie
[2:17:56] McCluren years ago, he made a comment.
[2:17:58] He said, "Many people many
[2:18:01] people talk about gospel music." He
[2:18:05] said, "But they're they're not singing
[2:18:06] gospel music." He said, "They're singing
[2:18:08] inspirational music." He said, "Gosel
[2:18:12] deals with the birth, the life, the
[2:18:15] death, and the resurrection of Christ."
[2:18:18] He said, "That's what gospel music is
[2:18:20] about."
[2:18:21] Now, Donna McCuren
[2:18:24] is Yes.
[2:18:26] um he he needed to have heeded his own
[2:18:29] um advice, but I'll leave that there.
[2:18:32] What he said was still still true. It's
[2:18:34] still true. Then you come to the
[2:18:37] satisfied
[2:18:38] soul. The satisfied soul still has a
[2:18:41] thirst. It wants more.
[2:18:45] It wants more and it wants more of God.
[2:18:49] It wants more of the spiritual
[2:18:50] outpouring like the artisan well that
[2:18:53] keeps bubbling. the the satisfaction
[2:18:56] that Christ stimulates a greater desire
[2:18:59] to know him more, to know of his love,
[2:19:01] more of his grace, more of his mercy,
[2:19:03] more of his word. That's what a
[2:19:05] satisfied soul wants. It doesn't want it
[2:19:08] if it it knows I've been satisfied with
[2:19:11] the things of God, and I want more of
[2:19:13] it. I'm not going to turn to the left.
[2:19:16] I'm not going to turn to the right. I'm
[2:19:17] gonna stay with the true unadulterated
[2:19:22] pure word of God and I'm going to drink
[2:19:25] from his fountain.
[2:19:31] I'm going to try to I'm going to try to
[2:19:32] bring this to a to a a close if I can.
[2:19:35] I'd like to to um I'm trying my best
[2:19:39] to in in in the book of
[2:19:42] John chapter
[2:19:46] 7. Book of John chapter 7. Now, I I was
[2:19:51] I I was reading through this a little
[2:19:54] while back and
[2:19:58] um in verse
[2:20:01] 37 through 39, it
[2:20:04] says, "In the last
[2:20:07] day, that great day of the feast." And
[2:20:11] so, I had to stop and I had to study.
[2:20:15] Oh, what feast were they talking about?
[2:20:18] And sometimes we just breeze over things
[2:20:20] that that that is it said and you're
[2:20:22] like, "Oh, it was it was the last day.
[2:20:24] It was a great day." Well, what was
[2:20:26] going on? Wh why why is it so important
[2:20:29] that that this portion of scripture was
[2:20:32] mentioned for us and it was brought out
[2:20:35] for us to read it. So I started looking
[2:20:38] up and if if and if I if my memory
[2:20:41] serves me and I I I'd called um I called
[2:20:44] brother Steve to ask him a question um
[2:20:46] about this. It was Sukkot if if if they
[2:20:49] were it was in a time they were that was
[2:20:51] the the the festival that was going
[2:20:53] through Sukkot and and so during that
[2:20:57] they they have a um they call it the
[2:20:59] water libation
[2:21:02] um one of the places I and I don't know
[2:21:05] if I pronounced it right hasho hashueva
[2:21:08] um was how how I read it and how I
[2:21:12] listened to it being pronounced simkat
[2:21:14] baked hasheva um dealing the water
[2:21:17] libation. And what they were doing, they
[2:21:18] were the the priest would come and and
[2:21:21] they would they would bring
[2:21:23] water and it they they made a big
[2:21:26] ceremony of it, right? It it was it was
[2:21:28] very formal and and during during Sukot,
[2:21:31] it was it's SKOT is is a very joyous
[2:21:33] time. It it's it's it's a big party.
[2:21:36] It's it's noisy and all this. But when
[2:21:38] they came to the part of the water
[2:21:40] libation,
[2:21:42] they were silent.
[2:21:44] And the priest would come come through
[2:21:46] with the water. And what they were going
[2:21:48] to do, they're going to pour out an
[2:21:49] offering of water. And they they're
[2:21:51] they're remembering the time that God
[2:21:54] provided water when they came out of
[2:21:56] Egypt. And they're they're remembering
[2:21:58] how he came and from a rock, he gave
[2:22:01] them water and kept them alive. And so
[2:22:04] it's it was a very very sacred thing
[2:22:07] that they would do with with this and
[2:22:08] and every it would become quiet and they
[2:22:11] would walk around. I think it was seven
[2:22:12] times that they would that they would go
[2:22:14] and and they would bring and then they
[2:22:15] would go to pour this pour this water
[2:22:17] out. So that was this that's the
[2:22:19] setting. Okay. Everybody's quiet.
[2:22:26] And the Bible says Jesus stood and
[2:22:30] cried if any man thirst.
[2:22:36] Hey, if if you're thirsty,
[2:22:40] you can come come talk to me. I've I've
[2:22:42] got water. No. See, that's what made it
[2:22:48] significant because they're here
[2:22:51] doing water libation. They're they're
[2:22:53] giving an offering of water and they're
[2:22:56] talking about how God provided water for
[2:22:59] them from a rock. Yes.
[2:23:03] And the rock
[2:23:06] was standing there in their presence.
[2:23:09] That's right, brother. His life was
[2:23:11] going to be broken apart.
[2:23:15] And water and blood was going to pour
[2:23:17] out. That's exactly right.
[2:23:20] And he got their attention by standing
[2:23:22] up when he wasn't supposed to.
[2:23:26] He had a habit of doing things like
[2:23:27] that.
[2:23:30] And he stood up and said,
[2:23:32] "Hey, if any man's thirsty, sir, I'm
[2:23:36] here.
[2:23:38] What are you looking for?
[2:23:40] I'm here. All you have need of is right
[2:23:44] here. I'm the rock that was in the weary
[2:23:47] land. I'm the rock that was in the
[2:23:49] wilderness that poured myself out to
[2:23:51] you, that gave life to you. And if
[2:23:54] you're thirsty tonight,
[2:23:57] come to me.
[2:23:59] and to stop the people. Yes, sir.
[2:24:04] Right. What What's he doing? Don't Don't
[2:24:07] he understand that this this is supposed
[2:24:08] to be a quiet time? They're pouring out
[2:24:10] water. This is water libation. We're
[2:24:12] we're we're doing this offering. And
[2:24:15] he's like, I am the offering.
[2:24:19] Everything that you're trying to do, and
[2:24:21] you think that you're trying to fulfill
[2:24:23] all these things of the law, all of that
[2:24:25] points to me. Open your eyes. is if you
[2:24:28] want a drink, That's right.
[2:24:31] If you want a drink of the Holy Ghost,
[2:24:35] come to me. If you need life, come to
[2:24:38] me. If you're thirsty, come to me.
[2:24:43] He was offering eternal life to them.
[2:24:47] Preach.
[2:24:49] And he's offering the same to you
[2:24:51] tonight.
[2:24:52] If you're dry, Amen. If you're thirsty,
[2:24:56] Amen. He stands up before you tonight.
[2:24:58] He says, "Come to me.
[2:25:01] I'll pour my praise on you. I'll pour my
[2:25:04] love on you. I will lavish you
[2:25:08] with my praise. I'll lavish." See, he he
[2:25:11] loves you.
[2:25:14] Everything he did was for you.
[2:25:19] He was
[2:25:21] born. He lived.
[2:25:24] He died. That's right. He was
[2:25:26] resurrected and every bit of that was
[2:25:29] for you and for me because he loves you
[2:25:33] that much.
[2:25:35] He did it all for you. And he stood in
[2:25:39] front of those people. Hallelujah. When
[2:25:41] it's supposed to be a quiet time, he
[2:25:43] says, "I'm right here."
[2:25:46] My Bible says he cried out.
[2:25:49] He wasn't ashamed to say who he was.
[2:25:52] And he wanted them to know all that
[2:25:55] you're trying to do, all this beautiful
[2:25:57] thing that you're trying to do, all of
[2:25:59] that is right here. It's me.
[2:26:03] He said, "He that believeth on me, as
[2:26:05] the scripture hath said, out of his
[2:26:07] belly shallow,
[2:26:09] out of your belly
[2:26:12] shall flow rivers."
[2:26:14] Rivers,
[2:26:16] not a stagnant pond, but rivers of
[2:26:20] living water.
[2:26:23] David was looking for a living God.
[2:26:28] His desire was to know a living God.
[2:26:32] And that living God is present.
[2:26:37] The same God that spoke to the woman at
[2:26:39] the well. You're right. Is the same God
[2:26:43] that's living in me. He's the same God
[2:26:46] that's living in you. We ought to act
[2:26:49] like that. That's right. It's not a
[2:26:52] different God. No, sir. The very same
[2:26:56] one that parted the Red Sea. Yes, sir.
[2:27:00] Is the same one that dwells in you and
[2:27:03] me. Glory.
[2:27:07] Verse 39. He spake, but this spake he of
[2:27:10] the spirit, which they that believe on
[2:27:14] him should
[2:27:15] receive, for the Holy Ghost was not yet
[2:27:19] given, because that
[2:27:21] Jesus was not yet glorified.
[2:27:26] Only Jesus can satisfy your soul.
[2:27:30] There ain't nothing in this world that's
[2:27:31] going to ever satisfy
[2:27:33] your soul. with the musicians come this
[2:27:38] evening. If you want to keep from being
[2:27:40] spiritually
[2:27:41] dehydrated, you must satisfy the holy
[2:27:44] thirst with the things of God.
[2:27:49] The things from his
[2:27:51] word and not from this world. That's
[2:27:55] true. Can I give you one more scripture?
[2:27:58] Go ahead, brother.
[2:28:00] Revelations chapter 22
[2:28:03] and verse
[2:28:05] 17. You can probably quote it by heart.
[2:28:07] They would even have to put it
[2:28:09] up. And the
[2:28:11] spirit and the bride.
[2:28:15] They say come.
[2:28:18] And let him that
[2:28:20] heareth say come.
[2:28:24] And let
[2:28:25] him that is a thirst come. come.
[2:28:34] He stood before the people and called
[2:28:36] out to
[2:28:37] them, "If you're thirsty,
[2:28:41] I'm here to fill
[2:28:43] you. You don't have to stay thirsty. You
[2:28:46] don't have to stay dry. You don't have
[2:28:48] to stay dehydrated. I've got pure,
[2:28:51] clean, unadulterated water."
[2:28:55] It would give you life everlasting.
[2:28:59] It gives you eternal life. Let him that
[2:29:03] is a thirst come and whosoever will
[2:29:07] let him take of the water of life
[2:29:11] freely take it. Receive it. He's there
[2:29:15] to pour it out on you,
[2:29:18] but you have to take it. You have to
[2:29:20] accept it. You got to receive it into
[2:29:23] you and ingest it. You have to. Would
[2:29:27] you stand with me this evening?
[2:29:30] Can we sing that little chorus again?

[2:39:15] Come and speak out. I need you now,
[2:39:20] Lord. Here we are tonight.
[2:39:22] We've heard this message.
[2:39:25] Maybe it's simple for some, but it's
[2:39:28] profound because it's biblical truth.
[2:39:32] And every one of us, it doesn't matter
[2:39:34] what our position is, we have found
[2:39:36] ourselves dry.
[2:39:39] The beauty in what you have provided,
[2:39:41] Lord, is as you said to the woman at the
[2:39:44] well, you take my water, you'll never
[2:39:47] thirst again. And the reason for that is
[2:39:50] because now the well is within us. And
[2:39:53] wherever we go through dry and parched
[2:39:55] places, through desert lands, through
[2:39:58] troubles and trials, you live in us. You
[2:40:01] are the well. You are the source of
[2:40:03] living water. And we don't have to go
[2:40:06] somewhere to find you. you go with us.
[2:40:08] So, we're standing in this house
[2:40:10] tonight. We have no desire to be
[2:40:12] religious before you. We just want to
[2:40:14] come sincerely and say, "We need more."
[2:40:18] Would you just stretch your hands to the
[2:40:20] Lord? I don't care what you feel about
[2:40:22] your walk. Would you just stretch your
[2:40:25] hands to the Lord right now and tell
[2:40:26] him, "I need some more. I need some more
[2:40:29] of that water, Lord.
[2:40:32] I need more of that mayim haim, that
[2:40:37] living water, the living water that only
[2:40:41] you
[2:40:42] supply. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you
[2:40:46] for that river.
[2:40:49] Thank you for the well that's within us.
[2:40:53] Out of men's
[2:40:54] bellies shall flow rivers
[2:40:59] of living water.
[2:41:03] Maybe somebody needs to tell him right
[2:41:05] now, "Lord, I've been drinking some
[2:41:07] other
[2:41:11] stuff. I've been drinking some other
[2:41:14] stuff, although it doesn't possibly
[2:41:18] compare. I've been distracted by some
[2:41:21] other
[2:41:22] flavors. And I'm committing
[2:41:26] tonight that all I want is your water.
[2:41:29] your water, your source, your
[2:41:31] supply. And I need your strength,
[2:41:35] Lord, to put down the
[2:41:37] distractions. Come on, somebody get in
[2:41:40] that prayer.
[2:41:42] I need your strength to put down the
[2:41:47] distractions and drink of
[2:41:53] you. Lord, forgive me.
[2:41:58] This is not a time for bride pride.
[2:42:02] Lord, forgive me because I have found
[2:42:05] satisfaction at times in other
[2:42:08] things. Oh
[2:42:11] [Music]
[2:42:12] Jesus, we long for you
[2:42:16] tonight. We long for the
[2:42:20] mayim, the living water.
[2:42:31] [Music]
[2:42:34] We don't have to
[2:42:36] rush. Doesn't have to be
[2:42:41] loud. Just tell him you love
[2:42:44] him. Oh Jesus, the lover of my soul.
[2:42:48] You're the glory and the lifter of my
[2:42:50] head.
[2:42:52] [Music]
[2:42:53] You're the beautiful rose of
[2:42:59] Sharon. You're the lily of the valley,
[2:43:02] the bright and morning star, the
[2:43:04] everlasting
[2:43:08] father. You are holy in all of your
[2:43:11] ways. You're faithful in all of your
[2:43:16] ways. You have given us the divine
[2:43:19] exchange.
[2:43:21] You have taken from us our filthiness,
[2:43:24] our unbelief, our rottness, and you have
[2:43:27] dressed us and clothed us in your
[2:43:30] righteousness. Hallelujah. Yes, Lord.
[2:43:33] What an exchange.
[2:43:36] [Music]
[2:43:46] [Music]
[2:43:48] You walked this earth as a
[2:43:51] man that you might become the kind of
[2:43:53] high priest we needed. One who is
[2:43:56] touched with the feeling of our
[2:43:58] infirmities. One who knows the struggle.
[2:44:01] One who was tempted in all manner even
[2:44:03] as we are yet without sin.
[2:44:07] And we need your strength tonight to go
[2:44:09] on, to go on, to run
[2:44:13] on. It's a climbing. It's it's not
[2:44:18] flat. Who will ascend the holy hill of
[2:44:21] the Lord? Purify our hearts and let us
[2:44:24] wash our hands in your word so that we
[2:44:27] might ascend.
[2:44:29] The priests that brother Dwayne was
[2:44:31] preaching about tonight, they go way
[2:44:33] down to the bottom of
[2:44:35] Zion to the pool of
[2:44:38] Salomim, way down
[2:44:45] below. And they fill up those vessels
[2:44:48] with water. And then they have to climb
[2:44:50] the holy hill of God. And I've climbed
[2:44:53] it from the pool of Salom. My family has
[2:44:55] made that
[2:44:56] trek. And it's a climb all the way up
[2:45:00] through the city of David, across Zion,
[2:45:03] over the OEL, right up to the Temple
[2:45:08] Mount. You did that for a reason, to
[2:45:11] show us that it's the ascended life.
[2:45:14] It's the It's the going
[2:45:16] up. It's the going up. Lord, tonight we
[2:45:20] want to go higher with you.
[2:45:23] Oh, the enemy desires to clip our wings,
[2:45:26] but we desire to go Oh,
[2:45:29] hallelujah.
[2:45:31] We desire, Lord, to soar.
[2:45:35] Do you have a revelation tonight that
[2:45:36] you were not chosen? You were not
[2:45:39] elected of God to peck around in some
[2:45:42] barnyard. Do you have a revelation that
[2:45:44] you were given wings to soar high above
[2:45:47] it all?
[2:45:49] How many of you are fellowshipping the
[2:45:51] fourth living
[2:45:53] creature? That's what we're to be
[2:45:55] fellowshipping in this hour. The fourth
[2:45:57] living creature comes. It's the
[2:45:59] anointing, the spirit of a flying eagle.
[2:46:04] Not an earthbound bird, but one who gets
[2:46:07] up above the stuff. Lord, help us to get
[2:46:10] up above the polluted water that he was
[2:46:13] preaching to us about tonight.
[2:46:16] And may we become so sickened by the
[2:46:19] stench and the smell of the of that uh
[2:46:23] contamination of this old world that we
[2:46:27] just cry out for pure water.
[2:46:31] [Music]

[2:50:16] move. We need to move.
[2:50:19] And why should I worry when giants come
[2:50:24] calling my name? So more stand.
[2:50:29] Oh my God is so much bigger. The
[2:50:34] troubles I face.
[2:50:38] [Music]
[2:50:40] So why would I hunger for power or
[2:50:45] riches or fame?
[2:50:48] [Music]
[2:50:50] Oh, cuz my God is so much better than
[2:50:55] all of these things.
[2:51:00] So I won't be
[2:51:04] shaking and I won't be
[2:51:09] moved cuz my God is
[2:51:13] faithful and all his promises are
[2:51:19] true. So I'll speak to the mountain.
[2:51:25] Oh, it's your time to
[2:51:29] move cuz my God is bigger, better,
[2:51:35] stronger,
[2:51:36] greater than you. My favorite verse.
[2:51:41] Well, my enemies scatter cuz they know
[2:51:45] the battle is done.
[2:51:49] My God is stronger.
[2:51:51] Oh, my God is stronger. for the victory.
[2:51:55] It's already
[2:51:59] won. Well, he died for my ransom, but he
[2:52:04] rose up on the third
[2:52:07] [Music]
[2:52:09] day. Cause my God is greater than death.

[2:53:46] moved. Oh, cuz my God is
[2:53:52] faithful. Lord, all your promises are
[2:53:57] true. So I'll speak to the mountain.
[2:54:03] It's time for you. You've got to move.
[2:54:06] You've been in my way long enough. Tell
[2:54:08] me. Cuz my God is bigger, better,
[2:54:13] stronger,
[2:54:15] greater than you.
[2:54:17] [Music]
[2:54:18] Woo!
[2:54:21] There's no mountain too high. No valley
[2:54:24] or a valley too low. There's no fear
[2:54:28] that I have. He doesn't already know.
[2:54:31] There's no problem too big. There's no
[2:54:35] weapon too strong. There is nothing for
[2:54:38] God that's
[2:54:41] impossible. There's no mountain too high
[2:54:44] and no valley too low. There's no fear
[2:54:48] that I have. He doesn't already know.
[2:54:51] There's no problem too big. There's no
[2:54:55] weapon too strong. There is nothing for
[2:54:58] God that's
[2:55:00] impossible. There's no mountain too high
[2:55:04] and no valley too low. There's no fear
[2:55:07] that I have. He doesn't already know.
[2:55:11] There's no problem too big. There's no
[2:55:14] weapon too strong. There is nothing for
[2:55:18] God that's
[2:55:22] impossible. And I won't be
[2:55:26] shen. No, I won't be
[2:55:31] moved. Cuz my God is
[2:55:36] faithful. Lord, all your promises are
[2:55:40] true.
[2:55:43] I'll speak to my mountain.
[2:55:47] Get out of my way. Take your time to
[2:55:50] move. Get out of my way.
[2:55:53] Cuz my God is bigger, better, stronger,
[2:55:59] greater than you.
[2:56:03] So I speak to the
[2:56:07] mountain. It's time. It's your time to
[2:56:10] move. Somebody ought to tell the
[2:56:12] mountain tonight. Get out of my way. My
[2:56:14] God. I'm not going to be passive
[2:56:16] anymore.
[2:56:18] I'm not going to be passive anymore. I'm
[2:56:20] going to take his authority over you. Do
[2:56:23] it again. So I speak. Speak to the
[2:56:26] mountain. I don't know what your
[2:56:28] mountain is, but you your time to move.
[2:56:32] I'm not going to be passive anymore.
[2:56:34] Cuz my God is bigger. He's better,
[2:56:39] stronger,
[2:56:41] greater than you.
[2:56:45] So I speak to the mountain.
[2:56:50] You get out of my t in the name of
[2:56:54] Jesus. Cuz my God is bigger, better,
[2:57:01] stronger,
[2:57:02] greater than you.
[2:57:07] Cuz my God is bigger, better, stronger,
[2:57:12] stronger, greater.
[2:57:15] Why don't you look at your neighbor and
[2:57:17] sing that? Cuz my God is
[2:57:20] bigger, better, stronger, greater,
[2:57:25] greater. Come on, you stick in the mud.
[2:57:27] Do it. Cuz my God is bigger, better.
[2:57:36] You're about to aggravate me. I said,
[2:57:38] you look at your neighbor and tell them,
[2:57:41] "My God is bigger, better, stronger,
[2:57:46] greater. than you, than any enemy, than
[2:57:51] any giant,
[2:57:53] than any
[2:57:55] mountain. Speak to it.
[2:57:58] [Music]
[2:58:12] So I speak to the mountain.
[2:58:18] Oh, it's your time to move. I'm tired of
[2:58:21] going around your mountain. Cuz my God
[2:58:24] is bigger, better, stronger,
[2:58:29] greater than
[2:58:31] [Music]
[2:58:33] you. Because my God is bigger, better.
[2:58:40] [Music]
[2:58:48] Does anybody believe that?
[2:58:52] It only works for you if you believe it.
[2:58:55] Your faith activates the promise in your
[2:58:59] life. You can't activate it in somebody
[2:59:01] else's life. That's right. But your
[2:59:03] faith will activate the promise of God
[2:59:06] in your life.
[2:59:08] [Music]
[2:59:10] Do you always have to be so
[2:59:12] loud? Folks, this is
[2:59:15] calm. I'm particularly calm
[2:59:17] [Music]
[2:59:19] tonight. What I understand is this is
[2:59:23] the most quiet world you'll ever live
[2:59:24] in.
[2:59:27] So if noise is your distraction, I'm
[2:59:30] telling you, you don't get on my cloud.
[2:59:36] You you you you're in trouble if you go
[2:59:38] either way. Yes, sir. Cuz eternity is
[2:59:42] about worship.
[2:59:45] I don't have to defend. I'm not even
[2:59:47] trying. But I looked at my young and
[2:59:51] uh I know his ways
[2:59:53] are
[2:59:56] strange. He he can't be still. I don't
[3:00:00] know where he got
[3:00:03] it. And I know that it would if there
[3:00:05] are folks who would would want to bind
[3:00:07] the worship leader, you know, to the
[3:00:09] desk.
[3:00:10] But but remember some people think it's
[3:00:13] song
[3:00:14] leading because that's what they called
[3:00:16] it in the 50s and 60s song leading. I'm
[3:00:20] not interested in song leading. I can
[3:00:21] get that from the radio.
[3:00:24] I'm interested in somebody who is
[3:00:26] interested in worshiping the Lord and
[3:00:29] leading me.
[3:00:32] Yes. And I've been led tonight.
[3:00:37] When the Lord
[3:00:39] um oh so many years ago when the Lord
[3:00:42] spoke to my wife and I about our first
[3:00:45] born, he said, "Call him Beyamin,
[3:00:48] Benjamin Judah,
[3:00:52] Yehuda. Benjamin, son of my right hand
[3:00:54] and Judah. This time I will praise the
[3:00:59] Lord."
[3:01:01] It marked him.
[3:01:03] He was marked for praise. Some of you
[3:01:06] have been marked for praise. Yes, sir.
[3:01:08] And from the time that he could raise
[3:01:10] his hands, he did. And he he beat the
[3:01:13] back of the seat till we'd want to
[3:01:15] scream.
[3:01:17] If you played any kind of worship
[3:01:19] music, it was sort of bred in him. And
[3:01:21] I'm telling you, we ought to be raising
[3:01:23] a generation,
[3:01:25] not to perform,
[3:01:27] but we ought to be raising our children
[3:01:28] and grandchildren,
[3:01:30] I don't usually brag on mine too much,
[3:01:33] but I am now. Just a minute.
[3:01:36] Elelliana's 10 months old. And we sang
[3:01:39] that line to her. What's the line? We
[3:01:41] sung it tonight. So I throw up my hands
[3:01:44] and praise you again and again. And her
[3:01:46] hands go up.
[3:01:49] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Somebody said
[3:01:51] she doesn't know what she's doing. She
[3:01:53] she may not know fully what she's doing,
[3:01:55] but she will.
[3:01:58] And she won't be so churchy
[3:02:01] that she can't put her antennas up.
[3:02:05] This is a time to contact him. I don't
[3:02:08] think we have to be
[3:02:10] wild all the time,
[3:02:14] but I think that we ought to do whatever
[3:02:16] we can do to get in his presence and
[3:02:18] stay there. Amen. Lord have mercy. I
[3:02:21] want to stay there, brother. That was it
[3:02:25] was a real blessing to
[3:02:38] me, you don't always have to lose your
[3:02:41] breath, spit, and sputter like some of
[3:02:44] us do when we're preaching to get the
[3:02:46] message across.
[3:02:48] I like it. I like it when ministers can
[3:02:51] have their what God gave them and
[3:02:52] deliver it the way God gave them the
[3:02:54] delivery. And I'm glad that you folks
[3:02:57] and you visitors as well are not so
[3:02:59] programmed to one delivery that you
[3:03:00] can't receive from from all who God
[3:03:02] would send this way. And sometimes when
[3:03:05] they're when they're gasping for
[3:03:09] breath, you can miss the point while
[3:03:11] praying. My family and I were visiting a
[3:03:13] church in a northern state and we saw a
[3:03:16] preacher preaching and we loved what he
[3:03:18] had to say, but we couldn't really enjoy
[3:03:21] it the way we wanted to because we were
[3:03:22] praying for
[3:03:24] him. We were holding hands asking the
[3:03:27] Lord that he not have a
[3:03:29] stroke because he really was putting in
[3:03:32] a lot of human effort
[3:03:36] and that's kind of dangerous.
[3:03:39] We just yield.
[3:03:41] We don't have to do it. How many of you
[3:03:43] are glad you don't have to do it? Okay,
[3:03:45] I'm doing what the kids tell me. You You
[3:03:48] got to say a lot before and a lot after.
[3:03:50] Okay, I'm
[3:03:51] done. Oh
[3:03:53] my. I love this more than soup and
[3:03:56] sandwiches down at the
[3:03:57] bottom. I love this more than anything I
[3:04:00] can think of to get in his presence and
[3:04:02] stay there.
[3:04:04] In the old days, we used to think that
[3:04:06] you had to always just lay hands on
[3:04:08] somebody and shake them nearly to death
[3:04:09] to get the devil off of them. But what I
[3:04:12] have found out is you get in the right
[3:04:14] atmosphere and you throw up your hands
[3:04:17] to the Lord and you may not need anybody
[3:04:19] shoving on you, those devils can't stand
[3:04:22] in the presence of the one that you're
[3:04:24] worshiping.
[3:04:26] Is that right? Yes, sir. And what I've
[3:04:28] also found out is you can't cast
[3:04:31] somebody's soul out of them.
[3:04:35] And the soul is made up according to
[3:04:37] scripture of the mind and the will and
[3:04:41] the emotions.
[3:04:43] And
[3:04:44] sometimes it's choices that people are
[3:04:48] making in their life. And we like to
[3:04:50] always blame it on devils. But sometimes
[3:04:54] it's just simple choices that people are
[3:04:56] making that invite the darkness. And if
[3:04:59] you'll just make a better choice,
[3:05:01] have no fellowship with the unfruitful
[3:05:03] works of darkness. They'll come to you,
[3:05:06] but like Jesus, may they find nothing in
[3:05:08] you. How many of you know the devils
[3:05:11] will come, the demons will come, but may
[3:05:13] they find nothing in you that agrees
[3:05:16] that agrees with them. Then they have to
[3:05:19] turn and go the other way. That's what
[3:05:21] the word says. Are you glad you've been
[3:05:24] in the house of the Lord?
[3:05:27] Will you Will you leave if we close?
[3:05:31] There's going to be some fellowship and
[3:05:32] a meal and it's just I think it's soup
[3:05:34] and sandwiches, but the fellowship is
[3:05:36] what will be what will be
[3:05:38] valuable. And there's no reason to be
[3:05:41] bashful or shy or I don't like to eat in
[3:05:43] front of people. Well, just go sit in
[3:05:44] front of people then. Put your plate
[3:05:46] there and just don't eat it. But get
[3:05:49] fellowship. meet somebody, shake
[3:05:51] somebody's hand, and and tell them you
[3:05:54] love them and tell them it's good to be
[3:05:55] in the house of God with them tonight.
[3:05:58] Let's see what the Lord will do
[3:05:59] tomorrow.
[3:06:03] I remember the first time I heard the
[3:06:05] song you were talking about, only Jesus.
[3:06:08] I was in the
[3:06:09] Philippines and was preaching in a in a
[3:06:12] in a big gymnasium and that they had a
[3:06:14] brown out or blackout. Which do they
[3:06:16] call it in the Philippines? A brown or
[3:06:18] black?
[3:06:20] blackout. Certain places in Africa, they
[3:06:22] called it a brown
[3:06:24] out. It was pitch black
[3:06:27] dark and we didn't think we could have
[3:06:30] service, but they they thought we could
[3:06:34] because they were used to it. Someone
[3:06:36] drove opened the front door and drove a
[3:06:39] motorcycle. Does that sound right to
[3:06:42] you? Hundreds of people there. There's
[3:06:45] probably 700, 800 people. They drove a
[3:06:48] motorcycle ride in front door right up
[3:06:51] to the pool pit, a motorcycle, and shine
[3:06:54] lights on the on the
[3:06:56] Bible so that we could preach from the
[3:06:59] battery of the motorcycle. And a man and
[3:07:02] his wife got up and sang, "Only Jesus
[3:07:06] can satisfy your soul." You're probably
[3:07:08] too young to know
[3:07:11] that. Probably you say it.
[3:07:17] And I don't see sister Laurel
[3:07:19] Marbeth are all the all. Let's sing it
[3:07:23] as we
[3:07:26] leave. I feel somebody rushing me. And
[3:07:28] you know what that makes me want to do?
[3:07:31] Take my
[3:07:32] [Music]
[3:07:36] time. Pull the words for for the old
[3:07:39] folks.
[3:07:43] The world may try. I don't have any idea
[3:07:46] of the
[3:07:48] [Music]
[3:07:50] key to
[3:07:51] [Music]
[3:07:54] satisfy that
[3:07:56] longing in your soul.
[3:08:01] You may search the whole
[3:08:07] [Music]
[3:08:10] world as
[3:08:13] before. You'll never
[3:08:16] know real
[3:08:21] satisfaction
[3:08:23] until you've known the Lord.
[3:08:28] Only
[3:08:31] Jesus can
[3:08:35] satisfy your
[3:08:40] soul.
[3:08:42] Only
[3:08:44] Jesus can
[3:08:46] [Applause]
[3:08:48] satisfy your
[3:08:52] soul. Do you believe that tonight? And
[3:08:55] only
[3:08:57] he can change your
[3:09:00] heart and make you
[3:09:04] whole. He can. Hallelujah. He'll give
[3:09:09] you
[3:09:11] peace you never
[3:09:14] knew. Sweet love and
[3:09:17] joy and heaven too.
[3:09:22] Only
[3:09:25] Jesus can
[3:09:28] satisfy. Let's go up one. Your soul.
[3:09:31] Sing it one more
[3:09:34] time.
[3:09:36] Only
[3:09:39] Jesus can
[3:09:42] satisfy your soul.
[3:09:49] And only
[3:09:52] he can change your
[3:09:55] heart and make you
[3:10:02] whole. He'll give you
[3:10:06] peace you never
[3:10:09] knew. Sweet love and
[3:10:13] joy and heaven too.
[3:10:18] Only
[3:10:20] Jesus can
[3:10:24] satisfy your soul. Give us another
[3:10:27] verse.
[3:10:31] If you could have the fame and
[3:10:38] fortune, all the wealth you could
[3:10:44] obtain, yet you have not
[3:10:49] Christ
[3:10:50] within your living
[3:10:54] here would be in vain.
[3:10:59] There'll come a
[3:11:02] time when death shall call
[3:11:05] you. Riches
[3:11:08] cannot help you
[3:11:12] then. So come to
[3:11:16] Jesus. Oh for he can
[3:11:23] satisfy. Oh one more time I promise.
[3:11:28] Only
[3:11:30] Jesus can
[3:11:34] satisfy your
[3:11:37] soul. Is that your testimony? And only
[3:11:42] [Music]
[3:11:43] he can change your
[3:11:47] heart and make you
[3:11:52] whole. He'll give you peace. He'll give
[3:11:56] you
[3:11:57] peace you never
[3:12:01] knew. Sweet love and joy and heaven
[3:12:07] too.
[3:12:09] Oh
[3:12:11] [Music]
[3:12:12] Jesus can
[3:12:16] satisfy your soul.
[3:12:19] Thank you Lord tonight for the word of
[3:12:22] the Lord and for the brother that you
[3:12:24] use to deliver your word. Let it be
[3:12:27] poured into him. New
[3:12:30] strength, fresh anointing to minister to
[3:12:34] those saints tomorrow in the valley.
[3:12:37] Give them good rest. Lord, bless those
[3:12:40] who have driven so far and some flown in
[3:12:44] to be with us. Meet with us tomorrow as
[3:12:47] you always do. Let us come with a
[3:12:49] prepared heart, Lord, just kind of
[3:12:52] feasting on what we've heard tonight.
[3:12:54] Bless every visitor. Bless every person
[3:12:56] who has made a sacrifice to be in this
[3:12:59] place of fellowship with you tonight.
[3:13:02] And we ask for safety as we travel the
[3:13:04] dangerous highways. Lord, bless the food
[3:13:07] when it's prepared and ready and our
[3:13:10] fellowship
[3:13:11] together. In the lovely name of Jesus
[3:13:13] Christ, we ask this blessing. Amen. The
[3:13:16] saints said again, you're dismissed to
[3:13:18] go tonight.
[3:13:20] Only
[3:13:23] Jesus can
[3:13:27] satisfy your soul. Meet us at the bottom
[3:13:30] of the hill. God bless you, honey. And
[3:13:34] only
[3:13:36] he can change your
[3:13:40] heart and make you whole.
[3:13:43] [Music]
[3:13:46] He'll give you
[3:13:50] peace you never
[3:13:53] knew. Sweet love and
[3:13:57] joy and heaven
[3:14:00] too. Only Jesus I love
[3:14:05] you can
[3:14:09] satisfy your soul. Did you lose your
[3:14:11] shoe?
[3:14:13] Love you.
[3:14:16] Oh
[3:14:18] Jesus. See if you can
[3:14:21] just satisfy your
[3:14:24] soul. He's the satisfying
[3:14:28] portion. And only
[3:14:31] [Music]
[3:14:32] he can change your
[3:14:35] heart. Oh, I love
[3:14:39] you. Love you, sweet girls.
[3:14:43] He'll
[3:14:44] give you
[3:14:46] peace you never
[3:14:49] knew. I love you
[3:14:51] Estie with love and joy and heaven
[3:14:57] too.
[3:14:58] Oh
[3:15:01] Jesus can
[3:15:06] satisfy your soul.
