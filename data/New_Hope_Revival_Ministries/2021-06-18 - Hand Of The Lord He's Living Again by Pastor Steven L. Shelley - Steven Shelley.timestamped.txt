[0:10] you can
[0:10] feel the wind blow but there's no one
[0:15] who really knows where it's going
[0:20] sometimes it's a breeze
[0:24] gently stirring the trees
[0:27] as it's blowing
[0:31] that's just how it is
[0:34] when the spirit within
[0:37] starts to flow in
[0:40] [Applause]
[0:41] like the wind it's a warm gentle
[0:45] touch from the hand of
[0:48] the lord the hand of
[0:52] the lord

[1:11] and make oceans run dry
[1:15] [Music]
[1:18] but the very same hand
[1:23] [Music]
[1:31] [Music]
[1:36] wherever i go
[1:39] this hand's holding mine
[1:48] there are times we all know
[1:51] there's simply no place to go
[1:55] but to jesus
[1:58] though the tempest may blow
[2:02] he has promised he won't ever
[2:06] leave us at the end of
[2:11] the road he will carry
[2:14] the load for the weakest
[2:19] saying listen to me
[2:22] stand still you'll see the hand of
[2:26] the lord the hand of
[2:30] the lord
[2:34] [Music]
[2:49] and make oceans run dry
[2:56] but the very same hand
[3:02] [Music]
[3:10] what a blessing to know
[3:14] wherever i go
[3:17] this hand's holding mine
[3:20] [Music]
[3:24] what a blessing to know
[3:28] wherever i go
[3:31] his hands holding mine
