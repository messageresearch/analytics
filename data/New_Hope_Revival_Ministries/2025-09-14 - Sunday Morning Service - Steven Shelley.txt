And I was sitting in the cool water of the pool. And the Lord spoke to me as clear as I've ever heard his voice. I looked to see if somebody else was standing around and he said, "I will magnify your inheritance now." Now, &gt;&gt; he had no way of knowing that that was a promise that I was carrying, but I believe it's for this house. &gt;&gt; Let's praise the Lord right now and thank God.

[Music] Who am I that the Lord of all the earth would care to know my name? would care to feel my hurt.

Not because of what I've done, but because of who you are. I am a flower quickly fading here today and gone tomorrow. A wave tossed in the ocean. A vapor in the wind. Still you hear me when I'm calling. Lord, you catch me when I'm falling. And you told me who I am. [Music] I am yours. [Music] Who am I? Not the eyes that see my sin. But look on me with love and watch me rise again. Who am I that the voice that calmed the sea would call out through the rain and calm the storm in me. Not because of who I am, but because of what you've done. And not because of what I've done, but because of who you are. I am a flower quickly fading. Here today, it got tomorrow.

To all the ones that you are a part of this congregation from week to week, we're glad that you're here today. Those of you that are out on the stream, we welcome you. We welcome brother Isaac and Sister Annie Fiser, pastor of the fellowship there in Indiana with all of those of you that came with them down to the shower yesterday uh for Lydia and Stephen. We're glad that all of you came. We welcome you today to as you're worshiping with us and glad that you're here. Sister Shelley Hayes from Arkansas. We're glad that you came to be here this weekend. The Lord bless you. Uh Brother Truman, I I I assume this is a niece. All right. And I haven't yet learned her name, but we're glad that she's here. I know she was here on Tuesday night, but we're glad that she's here. We welcome her. and uh Brother Luke Hespich, we're glad that you have left behind Wisconsin and brought your belongings to Alabama. We welcome you in the name of the Lord. Oh, the belongings are coming behind you. We're glad that you're here. We welcome you. We bless you in the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Sister Annie Barklift, we're glad to see you today. The Lord bless you. I've been missing you. What a blessing it is to be in the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; You know, there's nothing like it. &gt;&gt; As we were singing that song, I can only imagine that was a songwriter's words. But sometimes our imaginations go farther than those words go. And we imagine a little bit more than that and a little bit more than that. Because I know that there is come a word in the end time &gt;&gt; that there will be a bride with him &gt;&gt; sitting in his throne with him. and that there's a great number that no man could number that stood before the throne and said, "Give honor to the Lamb's wife because she has made herself ready." Oh friends, the trials that you're going through, the battles that you face, the hard palpitations that you feel, anything that you fight for in this last day, you just remember that there is something great just beyond this veil that we we see just beyond this realm that we're in. There's something greater there that words cannot even begin to fathom. But we just imagine with our mind what it might look like and we can go above that and know that he has prepared what m our minds cannot even imagine. But I'm glad that he lets us think about it and he lets us have have an anticipation of something higher that keeps pulling us along. And that's what the word of the Lord does for us. It causes us to be quickened, to be made alive, to reach higher than we've been reaching. And and we don't want to be satisfied with what we have had because there's much, much more to grab a hold of. There's much more to be had. And that is what we are here for today because there's much more that he wants to unfold to us. And I'm glad that he invited us into his presence. &gt;&gt; He is here. &gt;&gt; He is here. &gt;&gt; Will you stand with us once again? &gt;&gt; Lord, I thank you that every need that is among us is supplied. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; Lord, we don't have to beg because you didn't make us beggars. We are sons and daughters and we just simply say papa you see and you meet the need. So as we are turning our hearts toward the word, Lord, we know that even in the hearing of the word, we have been told that there is revel revelatory truth that can go forth that we can reach up in faith and have our need met at that moment as we reach up in faith. So we reach up in faith in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We glorify you and give you praise. Hallelujah. Have faith in God. Faith for the answer. Have faith in God. Let the faith of God, not just my own faith, but let the faith of God rise up as we're hearing the word today. the faith of God to reach up to grab a hold of the word of God that it becomes not just another word that comes and goes, &gt;&gt; but it is a word that becomes a part of the building blocks in us. Have faith in God. Have Have faith in God. Have faith in God for your answer. Have faith [Music] in God. Once again, have faith in God. Have faith in God. Have faith in God. &gt;&gt; Have faith in God. &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Love you. &gt;&gt; Oh, have faith in [Music] All is well. All is well. I want you to sing that from your spirit man. We have heard the message shalom. All is well. &gt;&gt; For there is a place for there is a place of perfect. [Music] the inner veil. So rest [Music] for all is well. I know you've been singing a lot, but sing this verse with me. It's the story of Elisha, the Shunomite woman and her son. [Music] That little woman found favor with God. So he gave her a son. Thank you, Lord. You did. One day while working in the field, that little boy died. Oh, but that woman's faith, it never failed. Even in death, she testified that all is well. Let that be your testimony today. All is well. All is well. We have heard. We have heard the message. Shalom. Peace. All is well. I believe there is a place for there is a place of woo behind &gt;&gt; behind the interval. [Music] rest &gt;&gt; rest for all. &gt;&gt; All is well. Just a little more in my monitor while I'm singing this verse. Now things have not always worked out like God's people thought. &gt;&gt; You ever been disappointed? You see, the bride is still here, but she's fighting. Oh, the greatest battle ever fall. She must have the faith of Abraham, knowing knowing God's word never fails. Just look up little bride and know better. [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. Praise God. All is well. Tell the enemy, "All is well. It didn't work. It didn't work. I'm still at peace." Oh, we have heard. We've heard the message. Shalom. Woo. For there is a place of perfect rest behind that inner veil. Woo! [Music] &gt;&gt; Again, things have not always worked out like God's people thought. [Music] You see, we're still here, this little bride. We're still fighting the greatest battle ever fall. Oh, but we've got to hold on and keep the faith, the faith of Abraham. We're knowing that in the end, God's word cannot fail. Just look up, little bride, and know that all is well. If you believe that, sing it like you do one last time. Oh, all is well. Are y'all singing it? Sing it. Sing it. All is well. Oh, [Music] even if you don't think you can sing, sing it. Oh, we have heard &gt;&gt; shalom. Woo my God. For there is a place for there is [Music] &gt;&gt; behind the inner veil. rest [Music] for all. [Music] &gt;&gt; So rest little bride. Rest. [Music] &gt;&gt; Look at somebody next to you and sing it right to them. So rest little bride. rest. &gt;&gt; All &gt;&gt; is well. &gt;&gt; Anybody else believe that? &gt;&gt; Anybody else believe that? &gt;&gt; Let's act like we believe that. [Applause] Thank you to the musicians. Come on back and join us as quickly as you can. I want you to be here. Turn to Ephesians chapter 5. And I asked brother Gley to go ahead and greet you, not because I don't want to, but because I I I just felt like it I just I wasn't sure originally where that was coming from. Um because I felt like we should go as quickly to this word as we possibly can. It's life to us. &gt;&gt; But I will tell Joseph who is up there in the tower that your work has already been appreciated in South Africa. &gt;&gt; They're sending word from South Africa. We appreciate the new camera positioning. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's something Joseph wanted to work have for us a long time and it didn't work out. Didn't come together. But last Saturday, Ben and Benjamin and I don't know who all else was helping got over here and put us a platform there so that we can have an angle on that side as well. We're just believing that we want to document and record what the Lord is doing now and what he's about to do. Ephesians 5. Um R.J., would you slip? Would you slip? I don't know if you can slip or not, but would you come up here and help me somehow while the people are getting their scripture ready? I have a particularly I'm having a particularly diffic difficult time with my my headpiece. When I got happy while ago, I realized it was sticking out there and I'm having a little bit of a distraction and struggle and just I don't care. Just do whatever it is. Smash, mash, push, pull, tug. I don't care what you have to do. Well, yes, it does, actually. Well, praise the Lord. Yes. I wished I'd have called you up here a long time ago. Thank you so much. I'm sorry for having to ask you to do it. Ephesians chapter 5, uh, beginning in verse 14. We are still in we we are still in a series. We're in two or three different series at one time. They've all got names. Maybe we can get it straightened out before we're through. We're still making wine for the master. Praise God for that. But we're now dealing with destinies that can be forfeited that can be that can be forfeited or fulfilled. And we're looking at it through the scripture. Today we're taking just a slightly different turn because the Holy Ghost said today that we should and we will obey him and we'll believe that God will let his word speak directly to your heart. Ephesians 5:14, wherefore he saith, awake, awake thou that sleepest. Let Let me say that again. Awake thou that sleepest and arise and arise from the dead. Do you believe God's still raising the dead? &gt;&gt; We need him to do it in the house this morning. &gt;&gt; He's still raising the dead. Hallelujah. And Christ &gt;&gt; shall do what? &gt;&gt; He is the light. And he wants to give you and I the light. &gt;&gt; When people look so miserable about their faith, &gt;&gt; I wouldn't want it. Would you? &gt;&gt; Uh sometimes you see holiness people or Anabaptist people and they're looking so miserable with their life. &gt;&gt; And you know, we're not drawing anybody to Christ with that kind of a a sourness about us. May we brighten up everybody's day. May we be so filled with the light and life of Christ that people are interested in what we have and who we know. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be a wonderful thing? If you're not happy about your faith, I just pray that you'll get that way. &gt;&gt; I just pray that the Lord will break forth in you with some joy. That's what we need is joy. Amen. See then that you walk circumspectly. It's a big word. Uh it's uprightness. It's in divine order. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't just mean mindful, but it also means mindful, sober. &gt;&gt; Uh it means that we should uh walk in a particular way because of the crookedness that's around us. We should walk in a particularly straight and upright position spiritually. Uh we should walk in a counter in a counter direction of how the world is walking. Not as fools &gt;&gt; but as wise. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Redeeming the time &gt;&gt; because the days are evil. I want you all to say redeeming the time. &gt;&gt; Redeeming the time &gt;&gt; because the days are evil. &gt;&gt; Yes. Wherefore be ye not unwise. It's very important to ask for the wisdom of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. I mean, we need his wisdom day and night. &gt;&gt; Wherefore, be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is. &gt;&gt; It's vitally important that you are careful not to criticize what you don't understand. &gt;&gt; And there'll be no need to get your feelings hurt over what you don't understand. The Bible tells us that we should not be unwise but we should be wise and we should seek to understand what the will of the Lord is. &gt;&gt; And this is not I felt I felt I felt I felt. I get really really weary with people who blame their feelings on the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's not just how you feel. Sometimes you you don't feel like coming to church. So, we're not led by our feelings. &gt;&gt; We've got to be led by the will of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want to come across that rough, but I just want you to know that we're we this little bride is to live above her feelings. &gt;&gt; In fact, one time, Brother Brandham said, we're just not even to to consider them at all &gt;&gt; how we feel. &gt;&gt; It'll get in the way of the word, won't it? &gt;&gt; Understanding what the will of the Lord is. and be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, &gt;&gt; but be filled with the spirit. &gt;&gt; I would just caution you to have moderation in all things, &gt;&gt; not just wine, but also chocolate cake. &gt;&gt; Moderation in all things, &gt;&gt; right? Don't be so crazy uh wild about anything, but just be be very careful that you hold everything in a in a moderate sort of way. If you're going to use the internet, you should do it in moderation. If you're going to if you're going to have social media, you should have it in moderation. It shouldn't be the first thing you go to in the morning, the last thing you go to at night. &gt;&gt; It's got to find a place in your life. &gt;&gt; If you're a YouTube addict, get deliverance. &gt;&gt; Amen. Nothing wrong with being able to have access to YouTube, but if that's all you spend your life doing, you're not walking wise. &gt;&gt; You're not walking circumspect. In fact, you're getting drunk. You're getting drunk on YouTube. &gt;&gt; See? &gt;&gt; So, we have to live according to this word and message by moderation. And instead of looking for something else to give us the dopamine rush, we need to be filled with the capital S. spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By the Holy Spirit, we need to be filled. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Speaking to yourselves. &gt;&gt; That doesn't just mean among yourselves. &gt;&gt; It also means to yourself. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I don't I don't think that that's what it means." I didn't ask you what you thought it meant. I'm telling you what it means by the original language. Amen. &gt;&gt; The scripture also tells us that we should build up ourselves, &gt;&gt; praying in the spirit, praying in the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; We hear people say, "Well, that that gift over there, you know, that's just self-edifying." The scripture actually tells us that there's a time that we must edify ourselves. &gt;&gt; There's a time that we must lift up ourselves. And what that means is when you fall, you don't lay there and wallow around in defeat. As grandma used to say, you pull yourself up by the bootstraps. &gt;&gt; You build yourself up. &gt;&gt; You pull yourself up and you keep on going. Can somebody say amen? &gt;&gt; Singing uh singing uh psalms, speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. That's spirit inspired songs. Singing and making melody in your heart, the seat of your emotions. Amen. &gt;&gt; To the Lord. If you're making melody to the Lord in the seat of your emotions, you'll keep your emotions in check. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't fly off the handle while you're singing sweet melodies to the Lord. You'll just you'll just be surprised what it'll do for you. Giving thanks always. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Always." &gt;&gt; Always. &gt;&gt; Giving thanks always for &gt;&gt; always. &gt;&gt; All things. And here's the key. Unto God. &gt;&gt; Unto God. Unto God. As the Lord wills. Unto God. As the Lord wills. It's unto God. And we give thanks for it. Whether we like it or whether it hurts us or whether we don't. We say, "Lord, you give, you take away. Blessed be the name of the Lord." We give thanks always for all things unto God and the father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Two manifestations here of the great eternal spirit of God. Don't forget that he is one. &gt;&gt; You may read of three offices. You may read of three manifestations. But let us not forget the scripture is clear. He is one here. O Israel, the Lord thy God is &gt;&gt; He's one now. Father, we need you today. We've had a glorious atmosphere created by the praise and the worship of the saints, and you honored it by coming. &gt;&gt; It must have somehow pleased your heart because you showed up in the house, and that's why we're here. We're not here to see each other as much as we care about one another. We've come here to see you today and you have not disappointed us. You've been with us and we believe that you have a purpose even in this portion of the service. So come now, do what you see that we would have need of and we'll give you glory, honor, and praise for it's in the magnificent and mighty name of Yeshua, our Messiah, the Lord Jesus Christ. We pray. And the saint said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; You may be seated. It was in my nature and in my tradition not to say anything at all about what our nation has just experienced. But when I woke up this morning, I had a little feeling as I went to bed last night. Well, when I woke up this morning, I knew that I was getting a nudge from another dimension, another realm that I should speak just a moment about what has happened in our nation. It was tragic news uh that we all dealt with this past week. I was very disturbed by a young woman, an immigrant riding a train in Charlotte, not Chicago. Not Atlanta, Charlotte. That's North Carolina. That is south, I believe, of the Mason Dixon line. Charlotte used to be a a little little city. Now it has grown evidently into something much larger than it used to be. Used to be a very safe place. And it still is considered the foothills of the Appalachians. Even though it's quite a ways couple hours away, it's still considered part of the heartland of the south. And here this girl, this woman is riding home and for whatever reason, somebody said, "I wished I knew the reason." What does the reason matter? We We may never know. People don't know. They're insane. &gt;&gt; They're driven by insanity. They're driven by demon powers. If you don't believe that there's a warfare going on in the realm of the spirit, I don't know where you're living. &gt;&gt; You got your head in the hole in the ground like an ostrich &gt;&gt; because we are in a spiritual battle. &gt;&gt; And it is not a political battle. &gt;&gt; If it were only a political battle, it wouldn't merit being mentioned in the pullpit this morning. That's right. &gt;&gt; But it's a spiritual battle. &gt;&gt; And we ought to be vigilant. We ought to be on guard in prayer &gt;&gt; and we ought to go where God says go and stay away from where God says stay away from. &gt;&gt; You want to be at the right place at the right time. &gt;&gt; And you want to know that wherever you go, you can take some light with you. &gt;&gt; Anybody with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; And for some reason, this hoodie fellow just gets up and starts stabbing her and no one moves to help her because they're afraid of him perhaps. Maybe they're afraid of being drugged into jail, into court, into prison for trying to save her, for trying to stop him. Because we know that our nation has a precedent now of prosecuting people who try to stand up and stop those who are trying to do others harm. I don't know what the reason is. I pray to God that wasn't racially motivated. But I want to ask you today to consider the hour that we're living in &gt;&gt; and pray like you've never prayed before. &gt;&gt; Before that girl got any attention. As soon as he got off the train, we're told that there were some from the front who rushed back to help her. It was too late. She had bled out. Now, this is a serious thing. I'm still trying to process this in prayer. Uh the next day, I I'm still dealing in prayer with it. It worries me. It bothers me. Burdens me. I said to my wife, "This is serious business." when you're minding your own business, doing nothing to aggravate or agitate the crowd, and someone just rises up over your seat and stabbed you to death. &gt;&gt; In America, &gt;&gt; I said, "We've got to be on guard and we've got to pray." Amen. &gt;&gt; And then the next day we hear or or some days after we hear this report, I got a notification that said Charlie Kirk has been shot on my phone. I didn't even move because I didn't believe it. I thought, why surely that is some crazy rumor, some urban legend, some foolishness that's going around because there's plenty of it going around. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; You don't have to agree with me. I just want you to listen. That's what you came for. I said, "Surely that can't be." And then we find out that it is real. It was tragic to me to find out that he had been assassinated. It shook me. &gt;&gt; It shook a lot of people and some of us who did not closely follow his organization. I did not. But I really enjoyed the spirited debate clips that I was sent by many folks from around the world with university students across America debating on moral and biblical issues. And because of that connection, I felt a huge sense of loss &gt;&gt; for someone that I had never met. And everybody I spoke to felt the same. If you didn't, that's your business. &gt;&gt; But I'm only bringing this up because the spirit of the Lord nudged me that I should. My biggest feeling this morning is I have a broken heart for a nation that once stood strong and moral, a nation that exists because people were grieved by their inability to worship God according to the dictates of their heart &gt;&gt; and according to the dictates of scripture. &gt;&gt; Stay with me now. Uh it it it's troubling. It's been in a downward spiral for a long time, but it's it's getting increasingly and rapidly worse. &gt;&gt; This nation exists because people said we want to worship God without the government telling us how to do it. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? It's unthinkable that we've fallen so far as a nation to the point where it seems acceptable to assassinate someone in front of their family &gt;&gt; and for the whole world to witness simply because of their stand on having a static unchangeable gender and biblical morality. There are two genders according to the Bible. &gt;&gt; Is that what the word teaches us? And so I I really did appreciate I I I I wasn't looking to his political opinion. That's neither here nor there to me. &gt;&gt; But what attracted me to hear the things that were sent to me and later to to follow up was the fact that he just boldly declared &gt;&gt; you know someone is telling you I don't know what I am. I'm not sure what I am. Sometimes I am a woman, sometimes I'm a man. Define a woman. Define all this kind of crazy talk that people do. And he just looks right at him at in the in the eye and said that's a lie. &gt;&gt; The word of God said the word of God said. The word of God said. &gt;&gt; I appreciate that in anybody. &gt;&gt; I I tell you, I appreciate anybody that'll tell us what the word says. And so what stood out to most to me about Charlie Kirk was that he had a love for the word of God &gt;&gt; and passion that he demonstrated when talking about a life of faith. &gt;&gt; Charlie Kirk believed that if we could get the youth of America back to the Bible &gt;&gt; that it was highly likely that some of them would fall in love with Jesus. That's right. &gt;&gt; And he knew if that alone could happen, it would deprogram their twisted minds &gt;&gt; from the liberal brainwashing and influence. It would begin to influence every area of their lives, &gt;&gt; including the way they voted. &gt;&gt; And he wasn't wrong about that. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you that a fulfilled destiny requires a devotion to truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; And while he may not have shared our revelation and understanding about many things, &gt;&gt; and while there are many in our ranks who believe that there's no salvation outside of the Malachi 4 understanding of who Brother Brandham was, we know that's 100% incorrect &gt;&gt; because it's anti-word. &gt;&gt; There's one requirement. &gt;&gt; Call on his name in faith. The Bible said, "Whosoever calleth upon the name of the Lord, &gt;&gt; is that what the Bible says?" &gt;&gt; Then that's what we're going to have to believe. &gt;&gt; Now, that doesn't make that man or woman an overcomer. &gt;&gt; Doesn't make them a part of the elect lady. &gt;&gt; But it means they have eternal life. &gt;&gt; How do you get eternal life? Because you believe on the Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said it's ABC's. Accept, believe, confess. If you accept that Jesus has died on the cross for your sins and you accept it and you believe it to be the truth and then you confess not only your sin before him, but you confess him to others, &gt;&gt; the Bible said the same shall be saved. Right. &gt;&gt; So, while he wasn't uh necessarily a believer like you or uh someone you could agree with everything that came out of his mouth, I don't know because I didn't hear everything that came out of his mouth. But I liked the fact that he believed that the youth, the heart of America is where the change was needed most. &gt;&gt; I like that. And while again uh I liked his dedication to scripture, &gt;&gt; he not only memorized it, but I believe he wrestled with it and he studied it &gt;&gt; and I believe that to the best of his understanding, he made every effort to live by that. &gt;&gt; I liked his hunger for truth. Uh it was clear. I like the fact that he committed himself to understanding the Bible to be more than a history book, &gt;&gt; but as the living word that transforms hearts &gt;&gt; and it can transform nations. &gt;&gt; I like the fact that he studied original languages. &gt;&gt; He loved Hebrew. He loved the Jewish people. He loved the nation of Israel. That's right. &gt;&gt; He publicly declared &gt;&gt; to every person who would listen that he believed in Israel's right to exist. He actually loved the Hebrew language. An apostolic Acts 238 believer posted a testimony. I wasn't there. I don't know if it's true, but he posted a testimony saying that he knew very well one of the pastors of Charlie Kirk who had and that he had personally struggled for some time concerning scriptures that he read about the Holy Ghost and talking in tongues. He went to a pastor and the pastor said, "If it says it in the word, you said I've heard you say we have to believe it. And the only requirement for receiving it is to believe it with all of your heart. &gt;&gt; That pastor testified publicly that he Charlie Kirk had experienced the very thing that he was struggling with. I wasn't there. I don't know. But I like the idea &gt;&gt; that if you're reading it and you find it and you don't understand it, you ask God to help you believe it. and then you open up your heart to receive it. &gt;&gt; Some of you may pretend like you don't know who we're talking about. I doubt that that is for most of us the case. I like the fact that he wasn't just looking at the scripture from a surface value. I heard him say multiple times, I had to change my interpretation, he said, because I found out it meant more than what I thought it meant. Would every one of us benefit from having that kind of an attitude? &gt;&gt; Lord, show me more about the original intention of your word. &gt;&gt; His sudden death reminds us we don't control our days, &gt;&gt; but we do control our obedience. &gt;&gt; Second Timothy, I think I gave it to you just for the people to look at real quick. 2 Timothy 2:15. Is that what you're going to preach about? It's just the introduction. And I'm not doing it because I want to. I'm doing it because I felt like I had to. study to show thyself approved unto God. &gt;&gt; A workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly discerning, rightly dividing &gt;&gt; the word of truth. Lord, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That word divides opinion from truth and reality. &gt;&gt; If you believe that, say amen. &gt;&gt; Let's look at it in the amplified. Study and be eager and do your utmost to present yourself to God approved, tested by trial, a workman who has no cost to be ashamed, correctly analyzing and accurately dividing, rightly handling and skillfully teaching &gt;&gt; the word of truth. &gt;&gt; I happen to believe that that's exactly what he was trying to do. &gt;&gt; I liked his boldness and his courage. I like the fact that even they told him multiple times, "We're going to kill you. We're going to kill you. We're going to kill you." He didn't let that put him in a cave. &gt;&gt; He didn't let that put him in a commune on the back side of the desert. &gt;&gt; If I'm going to reach the youth, I have to go to where the youth are. &gt;&gt; And he did. &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with that. He didn't hide his faith behind politics either &gt;&gt; or culture. &gt;&gt; But he boldly declared it even if it wasn't popular. He listened to others, weighed their words, but never let the voice of man drown out drown out the voice of God. So, if I had to pick a scripture, and I'm done with this. If I had to pick a scripture that I believe is appropriate to the life that I knew of Charlie Kirk, it would be Romans 1:16. For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. Right. &gt;&gt; Someone reached out to my wife because she made a post, passed something along and uh uh or or because of a post they made. Maybe she reached to them, but the the comment was was basically made. I you know, I don't think that he was displaying the the quality of a of a true Christian. Well, first of all, we're not supposed to be judging the motives of anybody's heart. &gt;&gt; That's up to the master. But my wife just said, "Can I can I ask what? Can I may I just Yeah. I said, 'Go ahead. So, she asked this person, "Uh, in what way are you talking about?" Well, I don't think he was always meek, and I don't think he was always kind, and I don't always think he was humble. I said, 'Honey, why don't you tell them &gt;&gt; that the same Jesus who said, "Blessed are the peacemakers &gt;&gt; is the same Jesus that went into his father's house with a platted whip &gt;&gt; and drove out not the not the sinner, but the religious hypocrite &gt;&gt; for making a merchandise of God's house." &gt;&gt; There's a time to be meek and mild. &gt;&gt; That's the only Jesus that America's interested in. That's right. One who is meek and mild. But as the old song used to say, this old world has seen the last &gt;&gt; of the meek and the lowly. Jesus. &gt;&gt; The one who's coming the next time is coming in the power of his kingdom. &gt;&gt; If you don't believe that, read the book. &gt;&gt; He's coming to settle the score. &gt;&gt; Scripture said so. The greatest battle ever fought in the Middle East is going on at the time of the second coming of our Lord to the Mount of Olives. He basically brings an end to a war between the the the children of darkness and the children of light. It has gone on so long uh then that there's going to be blood running like rivers &gt;&gt; through the Megiddo Valley. Some theologians identify this as the battle of Armageddon. Quite similar to the battle of Ezekiel 38 and39, the battle of Gog and Mog. so much blood running that the only way to deal with the unsanitary environment of the dead bodies will be that the master himself, &gt;&gt; Jesus, &gt;&gt; will call for the fowls of the air &gt;&gt; to come and consume the carcasses of those who lay dead. &gt;&gt; Blood running to the horse's bridal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm just quoting scripture. &gt;&gt; I'm just telling you what the book said. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And uh all of a sudden in the heat of the battle, people are running. Those who have not, you know, received their their translation, they're running to the mountains and they're crying out that the rock should fall upon them and cover them. It's a awful hard time. &gt;&gt; It's going to be a very difficult three and a half years on planet Earth. You believe that? &gt;&gt; I do. &gt;&gt; You're with the Lord. I hope you're with the Lord. I pray he came the first time to redeem his bride. The second time to catch his bride. &gt;&gt; Uh translate her. And the third time he comes with his bride. Revelation 19. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; On a white horse. &gt;&gt; And the armies of heaven with him. &gt;&gt; I'm just quoting the book. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And the armies of heaven with him on white horses. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine this great battle going on out there? Blood everywhere. Dead bodies everywhere. The Bible said so. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Well, I think it's metaphoric. I don't think you have to call birds to come and eat metaphoric carcasses. &gt;&gt; I don't think Jesus has to do that. &gt;&gt; I believe what the book says. Can you imagine this heated battle going on between nations and kingdoms of light and darkness and all of a sudden the skies fill up with angel armies? It looks like &gt;&gt; saints on white horses and the master, the king of kings. Read it for yourself. Revelation 19, faithful and true. Here he comes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I think that'd put a stop to anybody's fuss. &gt;&gt; Puts his foot down on the Mount of Olives. &gt;&gt; And the Jewish people that have forsaken him, all these generations look and say, "What are these scars in your hands?" &gt;&gt; And according to the prophecy of Zachchariah, he says, "This is that which I received in the household of my friends." and they receive him as the Messiah. &gt;&gt; I've met Jewish people in Israel who will tell you there's only one difference between you and I. You've received now imagine this now. You received the Messiah the first time he came and we'll receive him the second time he comes. And I said, "Yes, but do we necessarily believe that he is the same?" And I've had some say, "No, we don't necessarily believe that." But more than that, I've had them say, "Yes, we believe he's the same. I said the same office or the same person? The same person. Now, that's pretty powerful. &gt;&gt; It's God's plan. &gt;&gt; It's God's plan. It's what the scripture says. I'm not sure why you're quiet. &gt;&gt; So, we're in quite an hour. &gt;&gt; We're in quite an hour. I'm thankful that uh this man was not ashamed of the gospel. I I pray you and I will not be ashamed of the gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. I pray that we will will tell the truth no matter what it cost us &gt;&gt; and that we won't hide. I pray that we won't change the way we dress, the way we live, the way we look, the way we act because society says that it's not the way it ought to be done today. &gt;&gt; I think we ought to be getting a farther away from the world &gt;&gt; in the way we conduct ourselves, &gt;&gt; but not in the way we live this life. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we if we live it on 50 acres and lock the door &gt;&gt; and we're not fulfilling the last commission, &gt;&gt; which is to go and be a light, &gt;&gt; you got to tell somebody that when the whole world is wild, &gt;&gt; there's peace in Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And when everybody else is insane in this last hour, that God's got a people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Great peace have they which love the law of God. &gt;&gt; And nothing shall by any means offend them. &gt;&gt; And he said, those who keep their mind on me, &gt;&gt; he said, I will give them what? &gt;&gt; Perfect peace. &gt;&gt; Someone said, well, here we come to camp meeting and it's going to be a very difficult time. It's going to be a very hard time. We're all going to be burdened down. We're all going to be thinking about what happened last year. You can if you want to, &gt;&gt; but you will miss God's appointment with you now. &gt;&gt; I see. I'm going to have to help myself. Amen. To live in the past would be to give the enemy more credit &gt;&gt; than he deserves. &gt;&gt; Are hearts still aching? They are. But camp meeting didn't do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The devil did it. &gt;&gt; Selfishness did it. &gt;&gt; So why in the world would we want to magnify and amplify him? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Aren't you going to allow us? You grieve all you want to at home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when you come to the house of God, &gt;&gt; you better bring your shine with you &gt;&gt; because lives are at stake. &gt;&gt; If you believe I'm being too harsh, you wouldn't have liked the sermons of Jesus. &gt;&gt; He said, "Let the dead bury the dead. &gt;&gt; You follow me." I think I'm sounding kind of merciful at the moment. &gt;&gt; I just don't want you to let that be the object of your conversation. I've heard it four, five, six times already. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And you're not doing yourself justice. &gt;&gt; Neither are you serving her memory &gt;&gt; with love and justice. &gt;&gt; You're giving attention to to darkness &gt;&gt; and not to light. Amen. &gt;&gt; Again, we hurt, we grieve, we love, &gt;&gt; but we don't redefine camp meeting. &gt;&gt; We were having camp meeting uh for feast of tabernacles way before a tragedy. &gt;&gt; And it's only if you allow it to be what you what what what permeates your mind. Some of us are not afforded that pleasure because we have to keep fighting &gt;&gt; for you to have a place to reach up to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, uh we're praying, of course, for those closest to this painful thing. Of course, I have. I've certainly done my part. I hope you have. &gt;&gt; And I believe that God will help every one of them. But for us all to adopt that, to carry that, for it to become a matter of conversation among us in the nurseries, in our gatherings, I think that is overboard. I think we're absolutely missing the day of visitation, if we do such a thing as that. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm interested, Brother Daniel, in the fact that Charlie Kirk had an organization that was called Turning Point &gt;&gt; USA. Yes, sir. Well, that really strikes a note in me. And &gt;&gt; I'll tell you why. Because when this prophetic burden that I've been carrying now for a few months, when it fell on me, the Lord gave me a very similar kind of of phrase. I'm going to skip ahead. He spoke to me one one afternoon in prayer and he said, "My people are coming to a divine pivot." Well, I thought I knew what a pivot was, but I thought I better def I better make sure I get the right understanding of what a pivot is. A divine pivot. Let Let me read first a definition of a turning point. Turning point is a rich metaphor, a place or moment when things change direction. &gt;&gt; I like that. &gt;&gt; I I like turning points then. I'm for turning points in God. Turning points are divine, often painful, &gt;&gt; but they can usher in new levels of purpose. &gt;&gt; Destinies forfeited, but now reclaimed &gt;&gt; and fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Does that sound good to anybody? &gt;&gt; Scrolls that floated by, now reclaimed, reactivated, or rerouted. But the purposes of God march on. &gt;&gt; Somebody say glory. Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The truth. &gt;&gt; The truth. &gt;&gt; If any of us come to a place where we believe the truth is hanging on us. &gt;&gt; We need to understand the truth isn't hanging on us, neither is it waiting for us. &gt;&gt; It's moving forward all the time. &gt;&gt; And if you want to stay with it, you can. Amen. &gt;&gt; You just have to march. &gt;&gt; You have to march when you feel like marching. And you have to march when you don't feel like marching. &gt;&gt; You have to march when you understand the orders. And you have to march when you don't feel like understanding the order. You don't understand the orders. &gt;&gt; But you march on because truth marches on. Because the pillar of fire moves on. Because the cloud of glory moves on. &gt;&gt; Because the prophet tells us that God himself is constantly unfolding himself. That's right. &gt;&gt; We don't even yet know all we're going to know about who he is, &gt;&gt; but we keep following him and we learn more about him the more time we spend in his presence. Anybody here? &gt;&gt; Good. I'm just getting started. Turning point. A turning point is I'll come to mine in a moment. A turning point is when perspective change. When perspective changes. It may be a crisis. It could be a death, a moment of loss. But it can also be just a fresh awakening &gt;&gt; to the deep to the deep &gt;&gt; calling on the inside. It's here of a true believer at the noise of thy water spouts. &gt;&gt; The deep calleth to the deep. &gt;&gt; Sometimes the call is louder than than other times. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's almost silent. &gt;&gt; And there are moments of refreshing from the spirit of the Lord. Acts tells us moments of refreshing and restitution from the spirit of the Lord. And in those moments, it awakens that call. It increases the volume of the deep to the deep call inside of the believer. So tragedy can cause a turning point, &gt;&gt; but so can a spiritual awakening. Amen. &gt;&gt; In fact, tragedy can cause a spiritual awakening. &gt;&gt; But it doesn't have to be tragic circumstances. When those moments come, if we can recognize them and come into agreement with them, into alignment with them by mixing our faith with the word of promise that's been proclaimed, then destinies once forfeited. Once squandered, &gt;&gt; once we let them slip away from us, &gt;&gt; they can be reclaimed, &gt;&gt; renewed. Lord, &gt;&gt; they can do exactly what the spirit of God spoke to us today. He wanted to wanted to do to magnify the inheritance of the promises over this house. &gt;&gt; And brother brother Shaw screams out harvest. And that's exactly what it is is a seed sown Yes. &gt;&gt; Becomes a harvest. &gt;&gt; I will tell you that under under all of the evaluation that I have discovered concerning a martyr, he was he's a martyr. &gt;&gt; He died for for morality, for faith. &gt;&gt; He died because he had very boldly declared &gt;&gt; that there's two genders. Well, why didn't other people die? Because there are very few people that are going to say that in public &gt;&gt; because they're afraid to. &gt;&gt; I see Christian people scraping their bumper stickers off &gt;&gt; because they don't want to offend anybody. Well, I want you to know there's a time to be pe at peace and there's a time to offend. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I don't know if I believe that or not. I just believe what the book says." He said, "Think not that I've only come to bring peace." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There are families that are set against each other because of truth. &gt;&gt; I would to God that it were not that way. &gt;&gt; But but sometimes we're put in a decision where we have to make a choice for truth. &gt;&gt; And when that decision comes, we've got to find the grace and strength in the Lord to stand for truth. We want to do everything we can to strengthen family bonds. We want to do everything we can to build relationships and cast out wedges. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But there may come a time. &gt;&gt; There may come a time, it may be your cousin who decides all of a sudden she's a man. &gt;&gt; It may be your niece, your nephew who wants to bring his partner, her partner &gt;&gt; to the family uh cabin &gt;&gt; for a holiday. You may have to eventually make a stand. &gt;&gt; Somebody said that's not love. Well, I tell you, there's a time &gt;&gt; to send and spend all the love that you possibly have. &gt;&gt; There's a time to put bait on the hook and try to catch somebody from the snares of the enemy. &gt;&gt; There's also a time to snatch them out of the flames of hell by the power of the Holy Ghost that says, "The word is my absolute. Anybody with me? &gt;&gt; I appreciate it very much. When those moments come, those turning points, they they they're all through the Bible, scripture full. Saul to David, when the leadership shifted from Saul to David, I'd say that was a turning point. When the prodigal returned home &gt;&gt; after living out there with the swine, &gt;&gt; I would say that that was a a turning point when Esther was presented with this mandate &gt;&gt; for such a time as this. &gt;&gt; I love what Mori said. &gt;&gt; How do we know, paraphrasing, how do we know but that you were brought to the kingdom for for such a time as this? But it was like, "However, &gt;&gt; don't despair because God will raise up deliverance." &gt;&gt; I hope you hear this. &gt;&gt; God will raise up deliverance from another source. &gt;&gt; If you won't say yes, God will find somebody who has an eternal yes. &gt;&gt; Hear me now. If you won't surrender to the word, God will find somebody. &gt;&gt; If you won't put your house in order, &gt;&gt; God will find somebody &gt;&gt; that'll put their house in order. &gt;&gt; How do you know that? Cuz the word said so. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I like boldness. &gt;&gt; There's a place for it. &gt;&gt; I like courage. &gt;&gt; There's a place for it. The Lord gave me a phrase as I mentioned just a moment ago when this current prophetic burden began to fall. The word was a divine pivot and he said for some it would be a crossroads of faith. A divine pivot is often marked. It's very similar to a turning point but not exactly the same. A divine pivot is often marked by urgency, by clarity and the undeniable witness of the Holy Ghost. If if the Holy Ghost hasn't witnessed to your heart, if you're part of this body and the Holy Ghost has not witnessed to your heart that we're at a moment like that, I encourage you to pray a little more. &gt;&gt; Turn your attention a little more toward the Lord. As I said a moment ago, a little little away from the internet and from the things that that steal our time and see if he won't help you to understand. We're in a moment right now that must be marked. It's a moment that has it's a moment in time that has to be marked. &gt;&gt; It has to be sanctified, which means set apart. It has to be acknowledged &gt;&gt; to be the same to be that this is God's dealings with our heart. And we have to position ourselves &gt;&gt; so that whatever it is that he's about to do, &gt;&gt; that you're not in his way. &gt;&gt; I've made bold statements. I've said if you can't position yourself, if this is more than you can take, I'm sure you could find your place somewhere else. &gt;&gt; This has never been about numbers for me. &gt;&gt; It has always been about preparing a people. When I was just a young man and I saw by vision that bride being ravished, when I saw her wedding garment that she had so carefully picked out with modesty, she she strived to have something modest and elegant and beautiful. I saw this in vision and then when I saw that there were doctors, physicians who had come in and had in her moment of sickness, her weakness, she was now in bed and they had come in and uh literally ripped up her garment, ripped up her wedding preparation. And when the Lord, the angel, moved into that setting, he took pieces of that garment and distributed it to several who were standing there. I was one of those. I accepted that commission not as the commission, the only commission, the only one. No, it that's not how it was represented in the vision. But I took that very seriously. And I knew that somehow someway somewhere I would certainly play a role in trying to preserve what had been given. The word that had been given now destroyed by intelligent, you know, brainiacs &gt;&gt; who have approached the message of of the hour from an intellectual point of view by by by causing people to be afraid of the spirit and afraid of the Holy Ghost and afraid of the gifts of the spirit and have told us silly things like they're done away with and it's all behind us and we now have the truth so we don't need these other things and that which is perfect has come and all the kinds of things that they've used to take away the spirituality of a bride. When the messenger himself said that that bride in the last days would be fully dressed in God's dress wear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said the five-fold ministry was God's dressear. &gt;&gt; Interesting, isn't it? &gt;&gt; It is. It takes the ministry of apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, and evangelists to preserve the wedding garment, which is the re revelation of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To preserve it and to make sure that in the right time, she gets it back together &gt;&gt; and she gets it on &gt;&gt; so that she doesn't miss her appointment. &gt;&gt; That's why I'm here. &gt;&gt; That's what I desire to do is just obey God. &gt;&gt; I just want to obey God. So, if somebody gets their little feelings hurt along the way, let me go ahead right now and say, "I'm sorry. I'm in it. I'm sorry that we're still at a place like that &gt;&gt; in 2025 after serving the Lord all these years and being together as a congregation for 35 years that we still have to say to someone, I'm so sorry that you got your feelings hurt when the prophet keeps telling us over and over again, you're going to have to live above those feelings. Amen. That's right. Thank you, Lord. You ever get hurt? I do. But here's what I have learned. The quicker, the faster I can come back to joy. &gt;&gt; Somebody when I when things don't turn out the way I I thought they were going to turn out, I just get so beside myself, folks. pull it all back in. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, if some of you some of you some of who you are is out on get it all gathered back in so that you'll no longer be beside yourself, but you'll be all back together as a whole person and realize that life is going to bring &gt;&gt; so many opportunities to sidetrack us, to disappoint us, &gt;&gt; to give us hope deferred. &gt;&gt; But at some point, we have to make up our mind. I'm not going to hang out there overnight. &gt;&gt; Not even overnight. &gt;&gt; Not even overnight. I'm going to come back to joy. &gt;&gt; Why? Why would you want to do that? Because the Bible said the joy of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, if you don't come back to joy as quickly as you possibly can, you're not going to get stronger. &gt;&gt; Help me somebody. &gt;&gt; You're going to get weaker. And if there's one thing I know about the hour we're living in, the bride cannot afford to get any weaker. &gt;&gt; She must gain strength &gt;&gt; because we're coming around that last curve. &gt;&gt; The finish line is in sight. &gt;&gt; And if you're going around here just hurting people on purpose, you need the Holy Ghost. If that's how you live your life and and call that, you know, I'm just setting people straight or giving a piece of my mind away. God didn't call you to do such a thing as that. &gt;&gt; You ought to be tender. You ought to be sensitive. I ought to be sensitive to somebody's feelings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the truth is the truth is the truth is the truth is the truth is the truth is the truth. &gt;&gt; And truth must be told &gt;&gt; and truth must be lived. So, while we while we don't believe that it's right to pet our wounds and and be jealous of one another, I I mean to tell you something. It's a sad thing for me to realize that folks are still consumed with envy and jealousy &gt;&gt; at rapture time. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to ch I'm going to show you very clearly, if you haven't already seen it, I'm going to make it very very clear for us. We're not going we're not going to be translated out of here with the attributes of unbelief. &gt;&gt; And envy and jealousy is an attribute of unbelief. &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh Lord, give us pastors after your heart. Oh Lord, give us kind old doting grandfathers who will tell us how wonderful we are. And then somebody rises up and says, "No, I'd like to have a prophetic voice." Until they have one, &gt;&gt; and then they'd rather have they'll come and ask your thoughts. They'll ask what the scripture says. They'll ask how you feel. and then before they ever get off the property, make the exact opposite of a decision. &gt;&gt; It's going to catch up on us one day. &gt;&gt; It's going to catch up on us one day. May God give us all grace and help. &gt;&gt; It's time for a divine pivot. &gt;&gt; It's time for every one of us to have our own personal turning point. &gt;&gt; I said, Lord, let this be. You do believe. You do believe. Let me let me read this to you. Acts chapter 9. I need a few more minutes. Acts chapter 9:es 1-9. And Saul, Sha in Hebrew, Shaul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord went unto the high priest. Who is this? &gt;&gt; Shaul. Saul. Saul. who would become Paul, the greatest apostle of all times. Many people say there are certain elements of the messianic movement that really don't like Paul because under the inspiration of the Lord as a first church age messenger, he brought a balance between keeping rules &gt;&gt; and building relationships with God. And that bothers some people because some of us are more comfortable if we've got all the rules written out for us &gt;&gt; and we have rule police &gt;&gt; to tell us when we infringe. But the apostle Paul believed according to the word. He believed that if you could have a change of heart, &gt;&gt; you would find that faith and wholeness comes from intimacy and relationship with Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Not from just keeping a set of &gt;&gt; dos and don'ts. &gt;&gt; I believe in holiness. &gt;&gt; I believe men should dress like men and women should dress like women. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe men should have good clean haircuts. &gt;&gt; Nature should teach them that. Paul said, "And that women should have long hair." I believe the scripture when it says, "And that long hair is given her for a reason." &gt;&gt; It's given her for a reason. More than one reason. I believe that's what the Bible said. So, I believe in separation. But what I don't believe in is when we get to a place where we are judging one another because we don't all have exactly the same thought about every little detail. &gt;&gt; Now in a community of faith in a body of believers, we have an obligation. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; To keep peace and unity &gt;&gt; and sometimes that means if meat maketh my brother to offend, I'm just quoting the book. &gt;&gt; I love it when the book gets us. Don't you? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I love it when I've made up my mind and the word comes and says, then what do we do? We have to change our mind. &gt;&gt; If meat maketh my brother to offend, the apostle said, "I'll eat no more meat." &gt;&gt; This was meat, of course, that was being used and dedicated to idols. He said, "But that's going to be a problem for those who are weak." He said, "I won't do it anymore. My desire is to be able to reach somebody. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if something I do that I don't really have to do &gt;&gt; is offensive to somebody else. &gt;&gt; My I think I'm sounding like I'm mad and I'm not. Not at all. I've been in the presence of the Lord with you. How could you be mad at anybody? But the word, the word deals with us sometime in strong and strange ways, &gt;&gt; especially when we come to divine pivots and turning points. &gt;&gt; And Saul is breathing out threatenings and slaughters against the disciples of the Lord. In other words, the church, the Christians, &gt;&gt; went unto the high priest, and desired of them letters desired of him letters to Damascus, to the synagogue. Let's take this on into Syria. &gt;&gt; That if he found any of this way, you know, this is how the Christians identified themselves in the beginning. They were followers of of the way. would have been a lot simpler, less complicated if we could have just kept joining ourselves to the way. &gt;&gt; But we all have this desire to wear a brand like cattle so that we can be identified as belonging to to something on earth when the reality is our citizenship is not of this world. So, I'm certainly not going to strut around and tell somebody I'm a Brandomite. &gt;&gt; That's as offensive to God as it would to be to brother Brandon if he was alive. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to run around and tell somebody I'm this or that or the other. I'm a Christian, a Bible believing Christian. don't always get it right, but I'm I'm pushing toward being able to do that because that's what the way and and if you want to label me uh other than being a part of the Christian way, then I'd like to know I'd like to be known as a Berean. &gt;&gt; I'd like to be known as somebody who doesn't swallow everything that somebody says. &gt;&gt; But I go back to the book &gt;&gt; and make sure that it's also the word. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad you've got an absolute And so he wanted letters to go down into Damascus to Syria and start seeing if he could find any of those traitors who were still fellowshipping at the synagogue but had accepted the faith of Jesus of Yeshua. I'm going to see whether they're men or women. He might bring them bound unto Jerusalem. I'm telling you, he wanted to bring them in chains. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To Jerusalem. Let's read on. And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus. And suddenly there shine round about him a light from heaven. And he fell to the earth. And he heard a voice saying unto him, Sha Sha, why persecutest thou me? And he said, Who art thou Adonai? Who art thou, Lord? I don't know exactly who you are, but I know you're somebody that I ought to know. &gt;&gt; Lord, master, you seem to be somewhere above me. Who are you? And the Lord said, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that it didn't come in a mystery. Well, I am that one or I am that I am or I am the one you're look. I'm so glad that he just came right out and said, "I am Yeshua." [Applause] &gt;&gt; If he were to have said Jesus, nobody there would have known who he was talking about, including Shaul, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But he said, "I am Yeshua, &gt;&gt; which means salvation. I am the one to save. I am the promised one." And in English we would say, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. Somebody is getting a turning point. Somebody is getting a divine pivot. &gt;&gt; Somebody is going to have a change. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because you're not persecuting a church. You're not just persecuting uh some stragglers of the faith. It's me. And I better go ahead and let you know that if you think it's been hard up to this point, you're you now know who you're kicking against &gt;&gt; and it's going to get harder from here on out. Can you imagine this kind of language? In fact, one of the things we believe Shaul was using against the believers, those who were a part of the way, was he was telling them, "Ah, you are one of those who believes he was raised from the dead." Wow. I never saw him. I wouldn't believe it unless I saw him. Did you know there was a there was uh in the early church, the church of Jerusalem, we understand from history there there was a requirement &gt;&gt; that to be a voice in the in the church, the early church to be a voice, you you had to be a disciple or what maybe we would call today an apostle. And in order to be that, you had to have seen the Lord. &gt;&gt; Sha didn't see him until his divine pivot, &gt;&gt; until the day of his turning point, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He didn't qualify until that moment. &gt;&gt; And that day, he had to say with the rest of them, I've seen the Lord. &gt;&gt; I've seen the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; What if Peter would have got a religious spirit on him and said, "Yeah, well, you saw him. Haha. You didn't see him like we saw him? &gt;&gt; What if some of the other disciples would have said, "Oh, well, you didn't hunt with him and you didn't fish with him and &gt;&gt; he didn't tell you secrets at sunset." &gt;&gt; Oh, no. He saw him. &gt;&gt; All proof he needed. Somebody said, "Did he have the proof?" He sure did. He had the divine pivot. &gt;&gt; One moment he is fighting to persecute the way &gt;&gt; and the next moment he's giving everything that he has to the way. &gt;&gt; He's telling everybody with boldness, come join the way. &gt;&gt; What changed your mind, Paul? Oh, I saw the Lord. He met me on the road to Damascus. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He knocked me off of my onto my &gt;&gt; It's hard for you to kick against the pricks, &gt;&gt; you religious zealot. You've dedicated your life to killing those who follow me. But that's only because I got a work for you to do. &gt;&gt; And you don't get to do the work until you run from it. You don't get to do God's business until first you've run away from it. &gt;&gt; So there's hope for a lot of you. There's hope for a lot of us &gt;&gt; who didn't do it originally. Right. &gt;&gt; I think I'll quote my grandmother and make some folks mad again. My granny used to say when people would come and say, "I'm called feel called to preach." She said, "Well, if I were you, I'd run as hard as I could the other way." &gt;&gt; And they just look at her. You know, you can imagine these young men, they had respect for her and and you can just imagine the look on their faces when she said, "If I was you, I'd get out of it." Oh, it's like it was like sucking the air out of the room. It was like putting a pin in a in a needle in a in a balloon. They look so deflated. And and and finally one of them or two of them would get enough courage, you know, and they'd say, "Well, well, why is that?" You said, "Because if you're really called, you'll never be able to get away from it." &gt;&gt; The call of God will follow you wherever you go. &gt;&gt; I believe Paul would say, "Amen." The call of God will catch you on your way &gt;&gt; to do the devil's doings &gt;&gt; and turn you around. &gt;&gt; I I I would love to believe for a turning point in our nation. I would love to believe for a divine pivot. But what I recognize is we have to rejoice in what little bit of light we see out there. But there is a turning point that I'm pursuing and there is a divine pivot that I'm working toward and that is the awakening. &gt;&gt; Ephesians, &gt;&gt; the awakening. &gt;&gt; Awake thou that sleepest, &gt;&gt; and arise from the dead. Ephesians 5:14. and Christ &gt;&gt; shall give thee light. &gt;&gt; I'm waiting and believing and praying and giving my all to see the awakening of the bride. &gt;&gt; I want to see her coming out of her clicks. I want to see her coming out of her fractions. I want to factions and I I want to see her coming out of of her little uh you know isms and sisms and coming back to the absolute of scripture. &gt;&gt; I want to see her once and for all decide who God is and how many he is. and &gt;&gt; get rid of this two two Lord stuff and &gt;&gt; two soul stuff and all the craziness that people have have have done with the message of the hour in these years since 1965. I'd like to see them have an awakening. I'd like to see them say we're not we're going to we're not going to keep going along with something that we know has lost its life. There's people in this nation that are still dedicated to propping something up that God said a long time ago, I'm done with that order. &gt;&gt; That's Saul. I'm I'm done with the order of Saul. &gt;&gt; I've done got a David. I've done got a boy out in the field with a harp who loves me so much that he just as soon spend his whole day instead of spending his life telling about how good he is &gt;&gt; and how good he's been &gt;&gt; and what all he's accomplished. &gt;&gt; And how God built their church. &gt;&gt; I've done found me a little boy out there who'll sing all day and tell me how good I am as God and how much he loves his papa. &gt;&gt; The order is changing. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; There's an awakening coming to the people. And those who once supported the Saul order are now going to recognize that their future and their destiny is not in the ministry of Saul, &gt;&gt; but it's in the ministry of a psalmist. &gt;&gt; Those who will praise, those who will worship God with every fiber of their being, &gt;&gt; those who will cling to the word &gt;&gt; and not opinion. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And as he journeyed, okay, who art thou, Lord? I'm Jesus. And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what will thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do. And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man. And Saul arose from the earth, and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man. But they led him by the hand and brought him to Damascus, and he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink. Now, if I had time, I'd go and read the rest of that chapter. We can't do it this morning. You can do it later, and you'll find out that God always works on both ends of the line. Amen. &gt;&gt; Anybody listening? &gt;&gt; God always works on both ends of the thing. God's working on Shaul &gt;&gt; and God's working on an Ananas. &gt;&gt; And Ananas had been shaking in his sandals. And his little faith community had been shaking in their sandals because they heard that there was a religious Pharisee named Shaul that was coming to bind them all up and take them to Jerusalem. Right. &gt;&gt; And the Lord begins to speak to that that one ananas. &gt;&gt; Go lay your hands. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? &gt;&gt; Can you imagine, brother brother Saul? &gt;&gt; I'm here in the name of the Lord to lay hands on you &gt;&gt; when you've been hearing for for weeks and weeks that he would go in lay his hands on the people of the way and drag them to Jerusalem to be tried. And now just little old Ananas is going to be used of God. Am I right? &gt;&gt; To be laid to lay his hands on the on the great fear feared and dreaded Shaul who would become the respected and revered Apostle Paul. And he used just a little believer just somebody in the way who could get the courage. That was not only a turning point. Please understand that not only did Saul receive a turning point, so did Ananas. &gt;&gt; A divine pivot. His fear drained, his courage regained. He was ready to do the work that God had called him to do. &gt;&gt; It's powerful, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Go into the city. There's nothing like coming into alignment. Now, give me these last few minutes. There's nothing like coming into alignment with God's timing. &gt;&gt; Pivots are not random. Turning points are not random. They happen in God's chyros moments. &gt;&gt; Ecclesiastes 3:1, to everything there's a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven. &gt;&gt; You believe that? Yes, &gt;&gt; a divine pivot, a turning point alters the trajectory of a life, of a ministry, of a nation. Uh, I didn't give them these verses, but Jonah 3:10, "And God saw their works that they turned from their evil way. And God repented of the evil that he had said that he would do unto them, and he did it not." God said, "I'm going to destroy the city." Yona the dove, &gt;&gt; I need you to fly down there to Nineveh and tell him that I'm going to destroy the city. &gt;&gt; And what did the dove do? &gt;&gt; He flew the other way. &gt;&gt; He flew to Tarses. &gt;&gt; He was running from his call. &gt;&gt; Fearful. &gt;&gt; Let me just look around. running from the call that God had placed on his life. Zeliana asleep. Is it safe for me to sing? Who did? Who did? Who did swallow a joke? [Music] Who did? Who did the fish did? God prepared a fish. The Bible tell the whale did the whale did swallow Jo. The whale did swallow Jonah the whale did swallow Jonah down, didn't he? God prepared a fish. &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "I go I'm going this way." And God said, "That's all right." The Bible says he went, and I love this part, he did what? He paid his own fair. &gt;&gt; God may let you temporarily squirm out of your destiny scroll. &gt;&gt; But may I tell you right now, it's going to cost you. &gt;&gt; You're going to pay your own way. &gt;&gt; And there are no refunds when you spend something running from the call of your life. Somebody said, "I'm not a preacher and I didn't make you one, &gt;&gt; but you're a minister." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Man, woman, boy, or girl, we're ministers. We are representatives. We are ambassadors &gt;&gt; of the way, &gt;&gt; of the truth, of the life. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So, something happened. Three days and three nights. Not three pieces of a day and three pieces of a night. Exactly what the scripture says. I know there are all kinds of websites out there that talk about Hebrew idioms. And what I have found out in in in at least 25 or 30 years of studying Hebrew idioms is that it's like it's like the doctors when they don't know what to call it. They just give it a name. And when when a preacher doesn't know how to make the scripture sometimes fit his his text, his theme, &gt;&gt; he'll just blame it on being a Hebrew idiom. But the problem is there are enough Hebrew scholars in the world to let us know that sometimes people are just making a stretch. &gt;&gt; But when the scripture says he was three days and three nights, that's exactly what it means. And it was so vitally important to mark something beautiful that would come in the future. And Jesus said himself that he himself would be in the heart of the earth the exact amount of time. &gt;&gt; It's just what the book says. &gt;&gt; There was a purpose in all those things. There's always a purpose if we could follow the continuity of scripture. It's bigger than Google. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost will help us and lead us if we have a desire. Uh if we have a desire, he's faithful, isn't he? &gt;&gt; Something happened to Jonah. It was a miracle that old fish opened up his mouth and spit him up on dry ground and he ran like a crazy man to get down there. That was a turning point. &gt;&gt; And guess what? The people heard him. &gt;&gt; Took him through a journey, several days to get through the entire city. &gt;&gt; Repent. Repent. Repent. Repent. And guess what? &gt;&gt; They did. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And guess what happened? Jonah got mad. &gt;&gt; While some people get upset with the Lord for not bringing their word to pass. &gt;&gt; Jonah got upset with God because he brought his word to pass. &gt;&gt; What Jonah prophesied hap happened in the sense that they heard the word &gt;&gt; and they turned Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To the truth &gt;&gt; and then there would be no reason. &gt;&gt; Don't you know that the prophecies and prophetic promises of God, the the judgments of God, all of it has a redemptive purpose? &gt;&gt; And the purpose of God ever saying the purpose of God ever saying, "I'm going to destroy this city was to get their attention." That's right. &gt;&gt; And to cause their hearts to turn toward him. And it worked. I'm sure there were church police who posted all over the internet, Jonah's a false prophet, just like they do today. &gt;&gt; But Jonah wasn't a false prophet. &gt;&gt; God meant what he said. &gt;&gt; He said what he meant. &gt;&gt; But the people turned. &gt;&gt; It was a turning point. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was a divine pivot. May you have one today &gt;&gt; before you leave this place. &gt;&gt; I'm nearly done. &gt;&gt; There's something I know about a divine pivot or a spiritual turning point. And that that means that the obedience it has to be immedi immediate. It needs to be now. You can't keep putting up. Excuse me. You can't keep putting it off. Hebrews 3:15. today if you will hear his voice. &gt;&gt; Harden not your heart as in the provocation, the divine murmuring. That's where we were when we left off Tuesday night. That divine murmuring, those people who belly achd and grumbled and complained until they they all ate the same spiritual meat, drank the same spiritual drink. But with many of them, God was not pleased. They heard the same word, Hebrews 3 and4, but it it profited them little because they didn't do their part. And here's where it becomes very serious in this place. &gt;&gt; See, God's going to do something. He's always doing something. He's going to do something. We're at a divine pivot. We're at a holy turning point in this house. I believe it. &gt;&gt; I believe we're closer than we have ever been before &gt;&gt; to seeing some of the things that God has told us we would see. And where you've got this some people have this mentality. Well, I'll I'll I'll I'll believe it when I see it. You may, but you may not see it &gt;&gt; cuz this is the way it works sometime. today. You've got to hear his voice. You've got to make sure you don't harden your heart against it. &gt;&gt; You've got to say, "Lord, I'm ready to be used &gt;&gt; in whatever way." Because when God sends a turning point, when God sends a divine pivot, and I would say I would say that according to the program of God, uh, the death of this of this young man could be, it could absolutely be in some measure. It could be the potential is there for a bit of a turning point &gt;&gt; because while there will not be a national revival according to the prophet, there can be an awakening &gt;&gt; and there can be a restoration &gt;&gt; of calling people back to Bible faith &gt;&gt; and uh you know every generation deserves an opportunity. Please understand that this is how I believe scripture and the message. If God delays, if God delays and another generation is born, God is obligated. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because he's a merciful God. Yes. &gt;&gt; If if if God delays, even if it's based on something that someone did or didn't do, if God says one more 40-year lap around the mountain for y'all, remember, they didn't go in until the old generation had died off. If God delays and another generation arises on the scene, I personally believe that God's word has obligated him to visit that generation. Right. &gt;&gt; I I know people I know people who live uh less than a 100 miles from this church who believed and may still believe that mercy ended in 1977. I met one who told me that it ended. He he said we first thought it ended in 63 when the seals came but then he said we we thought well if if I predict he said he said I predict it'll all be over in 77. So then we began to realize that by 77 then regardless of what was happening in the world mercy would be over. And I I I said what about your children? Why Jimmy's daddy used to say it sister? You know he did. I said, 'What about your children?' Well, if they're born after 77. What about your grandchildren? Well, they're born after 77. I mean, you call that revelation. I think that's a hard-hearted man. &gt;&gt; I think somebody has gotten a little too puffed up. &gt;&gt; He spent a little too much time staring at a cloud. &gt;&gt; He could have been using some of that time to read the book. Amen. &gt;&gt; So there's no chance. He was telling me, "My children are here and they're going to have children and now his grandchildren have children, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And if Jesus terries, his greatgrandchildren will have children." And you're going to tell me that God's finished and there's no more mercy and the bride is still here and we're just fighting our way through. I want you to know that is unholy baloney. I can't believe you said that in the pull pit. Well, that's exactly what it is. Be glad I said it that nice. &gt;&gt; It's just unholy baloney. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If God delays for whatever reason he chooses, it's God. He's sovereign. &gt;&gt; Even if it means we won't line up. If he says time is going to be extended, the prophet told us the rapture is overdue. If it was overdue in 65, how overdue do you think it is in 2025? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But if God delays, then I believe according to the nature of God in the word, he is obligated. &gt;&gt; I don't think he minds us saying he's obligated. &gt;&gt; He likes to stick with his book &gt;&gt; to visit a generation. &gt;&gt; Amen. So what that means for us in this place is my children have a have a have a right it seems to see the kind of move of God, &gt;&gt; the supernatural occurrences of God &gt;&gt; in their gener in their life. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about out there across America. I'm talking about in churches that hold on to truth and believe that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. They have an they should have an opportunity. I believe God wants them to have an opportunity &gt;&gt; to have their spiritual eyes open to see the pillar of fire to be filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Brother Gley and I laughed. I did most of the laughing. He just nodded. Just, you know, nodded and and snickered or whatever he does. But when he when we were in the back, Benjamin was singing, uh, wouldn't take nothing for my journey now. I said, "Brother Gilly, listen to them whippers snappers. The journey. What are they 20? What kind of journey have you had at 22? &gt;&gt; I said they are. You and I have had a journey. &gt;&gt; He said, "We sure have. We've been through it, hadn't we? We sure have. And we're here to tell you &gt;&gt; that at the end of it all, it's worth the journey." &gt;&gt; Glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm glad it was my glasses and not my teeth. &gt;&gt; They're real. Sorry. They're not going nowhere. They're glued in. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't take nothing from a journey. &gt;&gt; The reality is it doesn't matter how long your journey's been. &gt;&gt; You realize that the grace and the presence of God makes the struggle. It makes the trial. It makes the heartache &gt;&gt; worth it all. &gt;&gt; I'm closing. No, I didn't fall. I just knocked my glasses into the into eternity there almost and had to go grab them. And now they're spotted. Can you imagine? I I had a little encounter with the deer yesterday. I I used to laugh at my mama. Forgive me, Jesus. I used to laugh at my mom as she got older. She just loved animals. She was never an animal lover. But when she got older, everything was cute. I would go along with her until she tried to show me kittens. Then I'd say, "Mama, yes, they're cute now, but they're going to grow up to be cats. And you know how I feel about cats." So she'd turn the page and show me a dog. And I'd say, "All right, now we're now we're communicating." She said, "Don't you just love to see them nursing their mama?" And I said, "Well, but you know what? It happens. The older you get, the more you find yourself taking an extra minute to notice the things around you. &gt;&gt; I'll stand like this and watch a lizard. Yesterday, I stood in the backyard by myself. Praise the Lord. Don't happen enough cuz when I'm at home, usually somebody's at home. But when you can get the house all to yourself, it's nice on occasion. They was all showering. I knew they smelt better when they got back. But I just stood for a long time and watched this little lizard wiggle across the way. And I thought, "Look at me. I'm appreciating things." I was sitting there in my chair studying and I I saw the mama deer, poke her head up right out our bay window and I eased over to the sofa so I could be closer to the window and and she saw me. She raised up her head. No wonder that thing gets so out of whack. She raised up her head. She looked right at me. I started started talking to her through the window and she stayed. She wasn't even worried about me anymore. She just started eating the flowers. And I thought, well, I'm going to get her some corn. We've done it before in and even Elelliana's got got the chance to do it. Feed her figs off the tree and feed the little babies, too. They'll come. And these this is a a group of deer that have been in our neighborhood for five four or five or six or seven maybe even longer than that generations of of deer. So they're it's this little tame pack of deer that uh one lost his mother some many years ago and a neighbor raised that one in the yard and now it's gone off and and they keep having babies and bringing them back. And I went out there to feed feed had a had handful of corn and and she just comes and she lets me rub her head and yes I wash my hands after her but she lets me rub her head and I scratch under her chin and talk to her the whole time and I'm thinking, "Oh my I'm I I am my mama." I said, "Oh, darling, I'm so glad you came this morning." I'm just talking to her like that. So, I posted those pictures and Sister Green's nephew, Brother Perry Green's wife's nephew, posted and he said, "Oh, Brother Shelley, uh, Aunt Janice would have loved to. She fed all the critters in the desert and she would have loved to have seen a picture like that." And all of a sudden, when I read that comment, I could hear her voice a song. I could hear her singing, "It will be worth it all. When we see Jesus, &gt;&gt; it will be worth it all when we see him. There's a place where it says earth's trials will seem as nothing. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you that the prize is worth the press. &gt;&gt; Amen. The victory is worth the battle. &gt;&gt; May God give you an opportunity and may you seize it &gt;&gt; to take a turn. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; A changing point, a turning point, a divine pivot and say, "Lord, whatever you have, &gt;&gt; whatever you have for me, &gt;&gt; now I've got to say this and I'll finish this Tuesday night." In Ephesians 5, where we started, verse 16, musicians are coming. Seeing then that you walk circumspectly, verse 15, not as fools, but as wise. Look at what he says. Redeeming the time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Redeeming the time because the days are evil. I'm going to read that in the amplified because some of you close seemingly close your ears when I'm talking about what it means in the Greek. Look carefully then how you walk. Live purposefully. Verse 15. Live purposefully and worthily and accurately, not as the unwise and witless, but as wise, sensible, intelligent people. But look at what verse 16 says. making the very most of the time, redeeming the time. Turn to your neighbor for just a moment and say, "You waste too much time." Some of you meant it a little bit more than you should have. Some of you were actually giving God thanks that you were sitting by who you were sitting. So, you had an opportunity to tell them what you've always wanted to tell them. You waste too much time. It's true. We waste too much time &gt;&gt; worried over over what we can't change, what we can't stop, &gt;&gt; what we can't prevent. We waste too much time trying to do, what we're not called to do, what we forget doing, &gt;&gt; what we're called to be doing. We run around in circles like gerbles &gt;&gt; to keep our hands busy &gt;&gt; while the while the destiny scrolls of the kingdom are just drifting down around us and we're not grabbing something. We stay separated from God's program for our lives. I believe there are people I don't usually say something like this, but I believe there are people watching this meeting right now and you know exactly where you belong to be. And there you see it. Why does it matter? Because God's got a plan. If he wants you, you need to wherever that is. I don't believe that streaming is the ultimate answer. We've got time to redeem. We've got to make the very most of the time we have left. And look at this. You may not like this translation, but it is so extremely accurate in this next phrase. Buying up. &gt;&gt; Read it. buying up each opportunity. That's what redeem means. &gt;&gt; In fact, the word is I is uh Strongs 1805. And it means to secure deliverance. It means to liberate. It means to ransom or rescue. It means to buy out. It means to rescue from loss or from mislication. It means to buy up or buy out. redeeming the time, buying back the time, and using it, squeezing it to get the most out of it. Is there anybody in this house that would say, "I have wasted time. I've wasted weeks. I've wasted months." Some of you might even say, "I've wasted years." And if you let the burden of that get too heavy on your shoulder, you won't be able to walk. You won't be able to praise the Lord. And so you've got to believe that what the scripture says is true. That by by the grace of the atonement, we can actually buy back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; forfeited destiny &gt;&gt; that we did not accomplish and walk in &gt;&gt; because we were wasting time &gt;&gt; when we should have been buying more time. &gt;&gt; And that's not with money. That's with doing. Because if you'll do what he called you to do, he'll use you &gt;&gt; in ways you've never been used before. &gt;&gt; And when you're in the permissive will of God, your harvest is proportionate. &gt;&gt; But when you're in the perfect will of God, your harvest is proportionate. &gt;&gt; There's an extra oil. There's an extra oil. There's an extra abundance that's added to what we accomplish when we're doing the perfect will of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. because we have recognized that this is a season. It's a it's a chyros moment. &gt;&gt; There are two kinds of time. Kronos and Cairos &gt;&gt; or Chyros we say chyros in Greek. And uh Kronos time is what you can tell on the watch and what you can tell on the on the clock on the wall. But Chyros time, it's set time. It's appointed time. It's an appointment with an individual, with a church, with a ministry, with a nation. And when you discover the set time, the appointed time, then you have to discover what is the purpose of this time. If we're in a new spiritual season, what is the purpose of this new spiritual season? And that's what we put our hands to. I've said this many times. I am closing. This is me closing. I've said this many times. You know when to plant corn and you know when to pick corn and you'd be dumb to try to reverse it. It's a fixed law of sewing and reaping. It's part of God's created program. And you'd be dumb when when your neighbors are out there getting ready to pull up the corn &gt;&gt; to go out and think it's time for me to plant it. &gt;&gt; Do you see the simplicity of this? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I know there's exceptions. I know there are things that that that can have an extended season and I know there are certain things you can plant twice in a season, but you don't start in October. &gt;&gt; You got to start mighty early and you need to be where there's some warm weather &gt;&gt; and where the ground's warm. You Indiana folks, you're you probably have to wait a little while for your soil to warm up and wherever you are in the country and you have to learn the appropriate season for where you live. &gt;&gt; And so you don't go out and plant when you're supposed to be reaping. You reap when you're supposed to reap. You plant when you're supposed to plant. So to think that we don't have to discover the spiritual seasons of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. And I've told you before that some time is is Kronos and it's on a timeline. It goes like this. I hope you hear me. &gt;&gt; I'm too tired to hear you now. Well, I I I pray you will hear it on a recording or something. Sometime is like that. It's it's linear time. It's it's a it's like a timeline where we learned. You know, I've been I was in school so many years ago that we learned simple addition on a timeline. You move three steps over and that's that's where you are. Three plus two, three steps and add two more and you're at you're at five. But that's not all of God's timing. Some of his timing is linear time or parallel time like that laid out on a timeline. Some of his time according to the scripture is actually what we call cyclical time. And that means never ending. &gt;&gt; And there's a scripture in the book of Mark, I don't have time to bring it out, but there's a scripture that talks about Jesus as he moved through the circuits of the synagogue. And that word is actually a word that's chosen if we would have translated it in English uh deeper it would have been it would have been translated as circuit which meant really you can begin but eventually you'll come right back to where you started. I I got to finish this. There's this there's this thought and I'm done. I don't believe you. Well, I don't believe me either, but I want to show you what I mean. Quickly, on the wings of a snow white dove, paragraph 143, Brother Bram says, "You don't know what I've suffered. Just mental oppression. Every seven years it's come all my life. That's where I'm at now. 78. What's he talking about? He's talking about cyclical time. He's talking about time that you can't just stretch out on a parallel because it continues to move all the way back around and all the way back around and all the way back around. Can that be broken? It absolutely can in a divine moment under the authority of Jesus Christ. If there's a cyclical season, some repeated something in your life that is no longer serving its purpose, it can be broken. But I'd want to know, I'd want to be real sure before I started coming against God's what he has used in the past. If God's ever used that moment, he used it for brother Brandham. He brought brother Brandon back to that place where he got a little bit beside himself every seven years so he could hear hear some clear direction for the next seven years. If some of us would have been listening when we were at this place some years ago, same place, &gt;&gt; we might not have had to do it again &gt;&gt; and again. He said in the indictment, every seven years your life changes. So if you thought it was just him, he said every seven years your life changes. So the seven times seven, you see, makes it kind of hard and that's a complete change. And he said it bothers the women. Men usually get a kind of a funny carrying on during that time. He's talking about the the the changing of life after the seasons of seven. Men used to get kind of a funny carrying on during that time and sometimes leave their wives. Sevenyear itch they used to call it. But women are are unfertile after that. And that means that the at least seven cycles of seven. And and we all go through that. We must remember that that it's things that we must bear with one another and understand those things. So there's a reason for us to understand that sometimes God brings us all the way back around to where we were to see if our decision will be different. That's called redeeming. &gt;&gt; It only works if you recognize the season. If you don't if you keep on doing and I'm going to be real honest in closing and I I regret that there that visitors would have to hear me speak so directly to you as a body but I recognize that there are some of you folks as much as I love you that this talk that has been stirred up in the last little bit around us about God doing something I can tell that you are just Really, I don't want to say that you would reject it, but I want to say that you you think you know, you maybe you have some prediction of how it will be. And maybe you say, "Well, we've heard this before." I guess we have. We should have heard it according to what that quote was. We should have heard something similar every seven years since we've been together 35 years &gt;&gt; cuz God brings us right back to sea. he did to Israel. And he kept bringing them around the mountain and around the mountain until the old-timers died out. &gt;&gt; He said he could have brought them straight across, but he had to bring them the desert route &gt;&gt; because if they'd have got across and saw that there was going to be warfare after they got in the promised land, they would have surely run back to Egypt. So he took all them trips around the mountain to get Egypt out of them. &gt;&gt; Only took him a Moses to get his people out of Egypt. But it took them many circuits, many cyclical seasons of time &gt;&gt; to get Egypt out of them &gt;&gt; so that a new generation &gt;&gt; so that a new generation could arise on the scene &gt;&gt; that would learn from the mistakes of their parents &gt;&gt; and learn from the mistakes of their grandparents and they would say, "I will not be denied. Amen. &gt;&gt; I will not be denied. I know that we're living in the closing hours. I know that according to the to the to the to the eclipse. I know that we're there just a little bit of light left in Leodysia. But I will not be denied. We need a young man, a young woman who would say, "I'm not of the generation of the prophet. I'm not of the generation of the witnesses of the prophet." Most of them are all gone. And some of you didn't have the privilege of meeting them like some of us did. But you could you you you realize that and you recognize that and you'd say, "However, I'm here. &gt;&gt; I will not be denied. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe the same God that met my fathers, the same God who met my grandfathers, the same God who met my great-grandfathers, will meet me. &gt;&gt; And instead of just waiting on him to track me down and nail my hide to the wall, &gt;&gt; so he can help me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll just run to him &gt;&gt; and I'll recognize that there's a turning point. There's a divine pivot. It's a moment of decision. I'm at a spiritual crossroads &gt;&gt; and I'm I'm being challenged to put my priority back in the word &gt;&gt; and then it's up to you. And like Jacob in days of old, I wrestled with the Lord. I would not be denied. I would not be denied. I would not be denied. And if you could let that rise up and produce super faith in this hour, I believe you you'd be glad you did &gt;&gt; because he's offering us an opportunity to go higher, &gt;&gt; to go deeper, &gt;&gt; to go wider. But that's going to require that church is not as usual. You see, God may move at 11 when we start. That would mean you'd need to be here. He might move at 9:30 after some of you have left or after some of you have not physically left, but you've mentally left because it's we're past 9. &gt;&gt; It may mean that we'd have to have a prayer meeting, a little extra prayer meeting. It might mean that we'd have to miss a meal. It might mean that we'd have to cut back on our sweet. It might mean that we have to make up our mind that anything God wants to do is worth a small little sacrifice or price to pay. If you've all if you always do what you've always done, you'll always be what you've always been. You'll always get what you've always got. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "We've gone as far with God as we're ever going to go until we're willing to pay a greater price." &gt;&gt; And somebody said, "But you don't know. I can't hardly pay my power bill. I've got problems in my children. I've got problems in my family. Yes, maybe we do know. Maybe we don't know. But I'll tell you what we do know. He's the answer. &gt;&gt; Revival in your heart is the answer. A refill of the Holy Ghost in your life is the answer. &gt;&gt; Spending time before the throne in worship and adoration. &gt;&gt; That's the answer. &gt;&gt; Get your eyes off of the problem and get them on the problem. solver. His name is Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't have to understand every detail, &gt;&gt; but can you believe? Can you believe? Can you recognize your turning point, your divine pivot? the Lord visited some time back in a time of prayer and he laid real heavy on my heart that we should meet the Sunday night before camp meeting for communion and footwashing. And that's what we're going to do. We'll have our regular service that Sunday morning, but that Sunday evening, I'll tell you the time when we get closer to that day because I believe that's what God wants to do among us to initiate what he's going to do for us. I started giving hints and saying a few things along the way. I I wanted to make sure that I had the confirmation from the Lord. Now, you visitors, you wonder why that's such a big thing. Because we've not had it in a long time. There's some of you who've been coming to church here for some time and you've never been a part of a service where we had communion and footwashing. Don't you believe? Oh yes, absolutely we believe. But anything can become common. And when it no longer means anything to people, I I hate it. It's religion. Then it's like a teenage girl who wears a dress because mama says, "You think you're really preparing her for life without taking some time to explain to her why we do the things we do? Why we dress the way we dress?" Sometimes we we get so used to doing it the way we've done it that we it means nothing to us and we forget that if Jesus tries some of us won't be around if we leave them without knowing why they believe what they believe. We've crippled them. We've not launched them. I care. I want you to know I care. It deeply disturbs me that what has been so precious to me would not be precious to the next generation if Jesus dies. It so matters. It consumes me. And it's up to us. It's on us. It's on us, brother Greley and I and and and all of us in that age group and above who really have had a journey to make sure that we instill and we teach and by example we break it down and show you why God has called us to this life. And if we don't, there arose a generation who just didn't know. They didn't understand. May God give us grace. May there be such a turning point. May there be such a burden fall on young married couples. May there be such a burden fall on young people unattached. Instead of mourning your life away if you don't have a companion yet, you ought to embrace the seasons of the Lord and know that God has something for you. And there may very well be a reason why he has preserved you and and held you back for such a time as what is ahead. God's got a plan for every one of us. It's a turning point. It's a divine pivot. What you do with it is up to you. Thank you, Jesus. I cast my mind to Calary where Jesus bled. and died for me. I see his wounds, his hands, his feet, my savior on that cursed tree, his body bound, [Music] and drenched in tears. They laid him down in Joseph's tomb, the entrance seal by heavy storm. A Messiah still and all along. [Music] Oh, praise the name of the Lord. our God. Oh, praise his name forever more. For endless days, I will sing your praise. Oh Lord, oh Lord our God. Oh, praise the name of the Lord our God. Oh, praise his name forever more for endless days. I will sing your praise, oh Lord. Oh Lord, our God. And then on the third break of dawn, the son of hell rose again. He trampled death. Where is your sting? The angels roar for Christ the King. Oh, praise the name of the Lord our God. Oh, we praise his name forever more forless. [Music] Lord, I will sing your praise, oh Lord. We sing, oh Lord our God. Oh, praise the oh the Lord our God. Oh, praise his name forever more for Lord. I will sing your praise. Oh Lord, oh Lord our God, he shall return in rooms of white, the blazing sun. Oh shall pierce the night and I will rise among the saints. Oh my gaze transfixed on Jesus face. Oh praise the name of the Lord our God. Oh we praise his name. Forever [Music] more for and Lord I will sing your praise. Oh Lord, oh Lord our God. Oh praise the name of the Lord. Oh Lord, we praise your name forever more for endless days. Lord, I will sing your praise. Oh Lord, we sing. Oh Lord. Oh, and praise the Oh, the Lord our God. Oh, we praise his name forever more. For ending, oh Lord, I will sing your praise. Oh Lord we sing. Oh Lord our Oh we sing. Oh Lord. Oh Lord our God. [Music] And you have the name above all names. My God. And you are worthy of all praise. So Lord, my heart, oh it'll sing, how great is our God. You have the name. [Music] You have the name above all. Oh my God. and you are worthy of all praise. So Lord, my heart, oh it'll sing, how great is our God. [Music] Oh, and how great is our God. &gt;&gt; Sing with me. Sing with me. How great is our God? We want all to see how great, just how great is our God. &gt;&gt; You're so great and mighty, Lord. &gt;&gt; How great is our God? Oh, sing with me. How great, &gt;&gt; how great is our God. We want all to see how great, just how great is our God. &gt;&gt; One more time, just like that. How great is our God and how great &gt;&gt; great is our God. &gt;&gt; Sing with me. How great is our God. We want all to see how great, &gt;&gt; how great, &gt;&gt; oh, just how great is our God. Right now, the Lord is offering you something. Maybe it's something that you were offered before and you were not in a position, a place of faith, or there were too many dead cats on the line, or you had other priorities. It could be that uh you just didn't take it. It's in those cyclical cycles of the Lord. And sometimes it happens even to a whole body of people of believers. It's up to you to discover. It's up to you to pray and ask the Lord, "Lord, what is it? What is it that you're offering me in this season?" If it's a closer walk with you, I want it. Yes. &gt;&gt; Just know just know there's a with every blessing, with every gift, with every privilege, there's a responsibility that come. It's not a price, but it's a responsibility that comes with it. Are you willing, if you if you desire that closer walk, are you willing &gt;&gt; to bear the responsibility of emptying yourself? I was studying the second transvision that the Lord gave to this body many years ago. And the man in linen, he spoke about the difference between the trumpet and the chauffar. And he said the trumpet is the work of men's hands. A man gets a vision, he gets a plan, he he makes a mold and he creates a a silver trumpet. But the chauffear is is different because in Bible days it's just the hollow horn of an animal. Today it's a little bit different, but in Bible days, an animal died for a chauffear to be able to sound. And the man in linen said that the little bride would be the chauffar, that it would be God's breath that would be in her. That's life, isn't it? Isn't that what happened to Adam? &gt;&gt; God breathed breath into Adam and he became a living soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The breath of God is what made Abram become Abraham. The breath of God is what changes everything in us. And God said, "I want to fill my people like the chauffear with the breath of God, and then they will sound my voice. They will sound the alarm." Brother Brandham said it this way. That bride will be the final voice of God to the ages. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; it won't be what we want to say. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It'll be what he's already said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Echoing &gt;&gt; sounding through our life as an emptied out chauffar. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What what they will do and what they would do then is sometimes there's a matter um it can be like blood. It can be hair that gets formed in a horn of an animal like that. and they and they would have to go in and clean that out. And so that's really where we are today if we if we want to be filled with the breath of God. The New Testament said, "And Jesus breathed on them and said, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; So the scriptures are clear. He wants to fill us with his spirit, fill us with his breath, fill us with his life, and then he wants to use us. And so somebody is getting offered what you've already been offered. but you weren't in a position to receive it. May you be I pray for all of us that we will be where we ought to be with him. That we can say, "Lord, now's the time. I take it &gt;&gt; proudly, gladly, humbly, thankfully, gratefully, and I'll do with it what you what you desire. No one can make that commitment for you, but we we don't want to prolong this anymore. Would you take this opportunity in prayer right now? Nobody telling you what to pray, but just according to the inspiration of your heart right now, would you ask the Lord, Lord, if there is something in your hand for me, I don't want to miss it. I don't want another 7, 10, 12, 20 year cycle. I want to take it now. I want to surrender my all. I want to be used for my family. I want to be used for my neighbor. I want to be used for my coworker. I want to be used in this church body to bring life. I don't want to be a pew rider. &gt;&gt; I want to be a worker in the field, a gleaner in the field. I I want I want God's fullness. &gt;&gt; I want to come into that place of full adoption &gt;&gt; where maturity speaks &gt;&gt; instead of childishness. &gt;&gt; Grow us up, Lord. Here we are. We we line up. We sign up. We've come with with open hands and arms to say, "Lord, we embrace your destiny plan for us, &gt;&gt; no matter what it looks like." There are many of us in this room who who have fulfilled previous assignments and and in those assignments, we learned &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. that your grace is sufficient for whatever you call us to. &gt;&gt; Lord, I pray right now that somebody who's been waiting and a and fiddling around with their life, missing every chance, will catch it this time and volunteer willingly &gt;&gt; to be what you have called them to be. Search this body, Lord, as only you can, and move us into a higher place of faith. May we criticize less. May we murmur less. May we praise more. May we support more. May we strengthen feeble knees, hands. May we lift up those who have fallen down. May we take this opportunity. May we redeem the time in the name of Jesus. Are you praying? Continue to do that for just a moment. How great is our God. Pray your prayer. Pray your heart. You can boil it down to here I am. Send me. That's really all you have to say. If you don't know what else to say, you can just say, "Lord, here I am. Send me. Use me. Speak through me. Speak to me. Here I am. Here I am." Some of you have looked miserable a long time. It's time for the joy of the Lord to blow out the cobwebs. It's time for the peace that passes all understanding to settle your decision-making processes so that you can fully surrender. I say that to you with all the love I can possibly have. I want to see you make it. I want to see you succeed in everything God's called you to. And you can be assured that if you're doing his will, your preacher will be behind you hollering, "Amen." Go, go, go. Do what God say. Do do be [Music] is our God. Sing with me. How great is our God and all will see how great, how great, &gt;&gt; how great is our God. &gt;&gt; Let's lift our hands to him and say, "Here we are. We take, we take what you have to give us. How great is our God?" &gt;&gt; Young and old, say, "I'm here, Lord." &gt;&gt; Sing with me. How great. &gt;&gt; Use me as our God. &gt;&gt; Occupy my life. &gt;&gt; See how great, how great is our &gt;&gt; I'm tired of the old pattern. I'm tired of the old cycle. I'm ready to go forward in you. Oh, how great is our God. Sing with me. How great &gt;&gt; intercessors arise. &gt;&gt; Our God. &gt;&gt; Let the prayer warriors arise. &gt;&gt; How great. &gt;&gt; Come back to your destiny. &gt;&gt; Our God. &gt;&gt; Come back to your purpose. &gt;&gt; We call the spiritual midwives. Come back to your purpose. &gt;&gt; Our God. We're called the stewards of the promise. Come back to your promise. &gt;&gt; Come back to your position. [Music] &gt;&gt; How great is our &gt;&gt; We call to the trailblazers. &gt;&gt; Come back to the front of the line. &gt;&gt; Help blaze a trail. &gt;&gt; How great. &gt;&gt; Be the arrowhead again. &gt;&gt; Our God. &gt;&gt; Be that which pierceth. that which goeth a hand &gt;&gt; for running anointings. &gt;&gt; Oh, see how great how great is our God. &gt;&gt; Come on, just a few more minutes. &gt;&gt; Oh, and you have the name above all names. I accept it. You are worthy. &gt;&gt; I take my responsibility. &gt;&gt; All praise &gt;&gt; and Lord my heart will sing. How great, how great is our God. And you have the name above all names. And you are worthy of all praise. Oh Lord, my heart will sing. How great, how great is our God. You have the name above all name. You have the name above all name. &gt;&gt; Jesus. Jesus. You are worth a name of all praise. And Lord, my heart will sing. How great is our God. Oh, and you have a name above all name. Worthy, worthy to be praised. worthy of all praise. And Lord, my heart will sing. How great. Oh, how great is our [Music] you have the name above all names and you are worthy of all praise. And Lord, my heart will sing. How great, oh how great is our God [Music] and how great is our God. Oh, sing with me. How great is our God. We want all to see how great and how great is our God. Oh, [Music] and how great is our God. Sing with me. How great is our God and all will see how great and how great is our God. [Music] Oh, and you have the name above all names. [Music] And you are worthy of all praise. And Lord, my heart will sing. How great, how great is our God. [Music] So I throw up my hands and praise you again and again. Cuz all that I have is a hallelujah. [Music] Hallelu. [Music] And I know it's not much, but I'm nothing else fit for a king except for a heart singing hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. So I throw up my hands and I praise you again and again cuz all that I have is a hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. [Music] Lord, I know it's not much, but I'm nothing else fit for a king except for a heart singing hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We need gap standers. &gt;&gt; Those who are willing to stand in the gap &gt;&gt; and make up the hedge. &gt;&gt; Lord, here I am. All my words fall short. &gt;&gt; Tell him I'm willing. &gt;&gt; I've got &gt;&gt; to fill in the gap &gt;&gt; to close in the breach of the hedge. &gt;&gt; All my gratitude. I'm willing to gather up the scattered stones of purpose &gt;&gt; and build again as I often. &gt;&gt; God has called me to build. &gt;&gt; Every song must end and you never do. So I throw up my hands and praise you again and again. Oh, cuz all that I have is a hallelujah. [Music] Oh, a hallelujah. And I know it's not much, but I'm nothing else for a king except for my heart singing. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Lord, as a people, we once believed for supernatural in our lives. Lord, &gt;&gt; your prophet told us we're supernatural class of people. We &gt;&gt; we we were born for prophetic purposes. You've showed us that your bride is called to a parabolic anointing. And our lives are parables. Your purposes are sometimes hidden, but we march them out. We walk them out. We live them out. Help us not to miss you in this hour, Jesus. We all have such a desire to be understood. We all want to be understood. We want to be heard and we want to be understood. The problem with living a parabolic life &gt;&gt; is you're you you won't always be understood until the till the fruit comes until the reality to the antitype matches the type. And you just got to learn to be faithful even in the vessel of misunderstanding. Amen. Lord, fill your people with peace today. It's unusual service. But you're God and you're a God of variety. &gt;&gt; Fill your people with peace right now. [Music] &gt;&gt; And I know it's not much. Have nothing else fit for a king except for a heart singing hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] Benjamin, come down and hand this to IAS and let him read it. I want you to read it as clear and unemotional as possible or we won't be able to hear it softly. This is something he believes that the Lord has inspired him to give to us and I want him to share it in his voice. &gt;&gt; There are angels around holding scrolls of destiny at this time. The Lord is wanting a surrendered heart. &gt;&gt; I believe it &gt;&gt; to walk in obedience. It will be given this day for whosoever will. &gt;&gt; I believe it. I believe it. I believe it. I believe it. I believe it. &gt;&gt; Are you a part of whosoever will? &gt;&gt; I am a part of that. Come on, my soul. Don't you get shy on me. Lift up your soul.

Come on, my soul. Oh, don't you get shy on me. Lift up your song cuz you've got a lion inside of those lungs. Get up and praise the Lord. So I throw up my hands and praise you again and again. Cuz all that I have is a hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Applause] And I know it's not much, but I'm nothing else fit for a king except for a heart singing hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] Cuz I wasn't made to be tinned in a grave. I was called by name. Born and raised back to life again. And I was made for more. [Music] So why would I make a bed in my shame when a fountain of grace come running my way? I know I am yours and I was made for more. Cuz I know who I am. Cuz I know who you are.

Even though you've really showed up today, let us not become complacent and satisfied with just this, knowing that there's so much more to be had of you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, I ask that you would take the words that we've heard today and that you would plant them so deep in our heart. Let us go back and listen to it again. &gt;&gt; Lord, I ask that you would just continue to move among your people. &gt;&gt; We just love you, Lord.
