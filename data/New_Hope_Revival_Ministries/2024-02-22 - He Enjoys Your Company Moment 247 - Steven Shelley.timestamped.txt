[0:00] but I want you to know there's different
[0:01] kind of Destinies there's one that you
[0:04] make for yourself you you know you plan
[0:06] your life well God gets in the middle of
[0:09] that little cottage by the by the river
[0:12] white picket fence 2.5
[0:16] children and God gets in the midst and
[0:19] he said that may be your thoughts that
[0:21] may be your plans that may be what
[0:23] you're planning for a destiny but I've
[0:25] got something entirely
[0:27] different and it may not seem great in
[0:30] the duration but it will certainly seem
[0:32] greater at the end of the journey in
[0:35] fact there's going to be some heartache
[0:37] and and trial and hardship on the way
[0:40] and when you and I were planning how our
[0:42] life was going to be we left all that
[0:45] out we left out all all
[0:48] difficulty we never made any room for
[0:52] trouble and look what happened God said
[0:55] I'm going to harness trouble I'm going
[0:58] to take control and dominion over
[1:00] problems and hardship and I'm going to
[1:02] use it so that it won't be wasted in
[1:04] your life it's going to bring you to a
[1:07] place where you can receive a personal
[1:11] intimate revelation of the glory of God
[1:14] before way before it's revealed to All
[1:18] Flesh we're talking about when God shows
[1:21] up in a manifested way and he wants a
[1:24] relationship with you you know that's
[1:27] powerful God has an appointment we you
[1:29] know one thing about his
[1:32] appointments he never runs late right
[1:35] you see there there are two paradigms in
[1:39] adoption one it is the uh Paradigm of of
[1:44] bridal uh Authority or Bridal possession
[1:47] Bridal
[1:48] inheritance and you relate to him as a
[1:52] bride and that is a very intimate
[1:54] personal thing remember he's not looking
[1:57] for worship he's looking for
[2:01] worshippers he's not looking for a group
[2:03] he's looking for
[2:05] individuals and that doesn't mean that
[2:07] it's not a many-membered bride it's a
[2:09] many membered bride it's a many membered
[2:12] body it's Oneness it's an intimate
[2:16] relationship with you on the other side
[2:18] of that coin is
[2:20] sunship and sunship is not as intimate
[2:24] and private and personal as Bridal we
[2:28] get them both
[2:30] God reveals certain things to us in the
[2:33] Paradigm of sunship
[2:36] authority
[2:38] possession and he reveals certain things
[2:41] to us in the Paradigm of of the bride
[2:44] and the bridegroom
[2:46] intimacy Fellowship just you and him and
[2:50] until we get that until we understand
[2:54] that and our minds don't make it
[2:57] something weird but our minds begin to
[3:00] make it something special because that's
[3:03] what it is he was searching for you if
[3:07] you would have been the only one he was
[3:09] searching for you he wants fellowship
[3:13] with you having fellowship with me is
[3:17] not enough for you he wants to have
[3:19] fellowship with you so I want you to
[3:22] understand that this bride that God has
[3:26] chosen for the last Church age of Leo
[3:30] he wants to reveal his glory to us in a
[3:33] very personal and private way when the
[3:36] when the veil of the tent
[3:38] Falls and it's just you and him that's
[3:42] the deepest encounter that you can have
[3:46] with the glory when everything else is
[3:48] shut out and it's just you and him
[3:52] that's where you know him as he desires
[3:55] to be known come on and there's nothing
[3:59] hidden
[4:03] you're you're naked before him just
[4:06] following along the Paradigm you realize
[4:09] that there's nothing you can hide from
[4:11] him and you also realize that he sees
[4:14] you as you are and loves you ever the
[4:18] more nothing that he sees about you in
[4:21] that intimate place of relationship
[4:23] causes him to love you less in fact he
[4:26] loves you more because you're making
[4:29] time for
[4:30] him and he enjoys your
[4:38] company
