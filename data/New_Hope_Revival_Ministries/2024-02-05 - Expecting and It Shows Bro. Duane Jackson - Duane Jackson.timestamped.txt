[1:09:51] you to ask the Lord to comfort sister
[1:09:55] Sally and her family uh she wanted us to
[1:09:59] thank you for praying and her mother
[1:10:02] made her final
[1:10:06] Crossing she had been sick a long time
[1:10:09] like my mom and didn't always recognize
[1:10:13] her
[1:10:14] family and it's been a long process but
[1:10:18] she has finally stepped across praise be
[1:10:21] to God and she loved the Lord and served
[1:10:25] for many years as a preacher's wife
[1:10:27] pastor's wife and uh and I tell you if

[1:23:22] izing power of almighty God I'm not
[1:23:26] ashamed of it I have no intention of
[1:23:29] going back to 1906 Pentecost I'm heading
[1:23:32] all the way back to the upper room come
[1:23:35] on I want everything God did for the
[1:23:38] disciples that day when he poured the
[1:23:40] Holy Ghost on them and once I get all
[1:23:43] the Holy Ghost I can have I'm marching
[1:23:45] all the way back to
[1:23:47] Eden because it's not just back to
[1:23:50] Pentecost it's back to the garden it's
[1:23:52] back to the beginning it's back to
[1:23:55] dominion and Authority
[1:23:59] Hallelujah and we're not ashamed I'm not
[1:24:02] ashamed I'm not
[1:24:04] ashamed brother Brandon was telling the
[1:24:07] story about FF
[1:24:09] Bosworth daddy Bosworth and he preached
[1:24:12] on
[1:24:13] atmosphere and he said it doesn't matter
[1:24:16] you put a hen egg under a hen it'll
[1:24:19] hatch but if you put it under a hound
[1:24:22] dog it'll
[1:24:25] hatch it's not what's sitting on top of
[1:24:27] it that causes it to hatch it's not
[1:24:30] whether it's his real mama or not that
[1:24:32] causes it to hatch it's the
[1:24:35] atmosphere and in an atmosphere like
[1:24:37] we're experiencing this morning anything
[1:24:40] can happen in your life and something
[1:24:43] may happen this morning and you may not
[1:24:45] even know it has happen until about 4:00
[1:24:48] this afternoon when it Dawns on you that
[1:24:50] pain is gone when it Dawns on you that
[1:24:54] the depression isn't there anymore I've
[1:24:56] seen God
[1:24:58] deliver I've seen God deliver people in
[1:25:01] the right
[1:25:03] atmosphere and it took him a long time
[1:25:06] to even realize what it taking place in
[1:25:09] their life maybe that's happened to some
[1:25:11] of you I'm not preaching I'm sister
[1:25:14] Beverly I'll get yours in another time
[1:25:16] I'm not going to sing anymore I'm
[1:25:18] turning this brother loose today to give
[1:25:21] us what God has laid on his heart they
[1:25:23] have had a battle in the night but
[1:25:26] they're here on time looking as good as
[1:25:29] could be
[1:25:34] expected ready to do God's word will and
[1:25:37] give us his word I'm so happy for every
[1:25:40] one of you here I I know brother Brandon
[1:25:44] was a little critical of that that
[1:25:46] amount of transfiguration scripture
[1:25:48] there you know sometime he said isn't
[1:25:50] that just like a denomination want to
[1:25:53] build a church and stay a while but when
[1:25:56] I look at it I look at it like brother
[1:25:57] gy did I don't want to build a mother
[1:26:01] church and dedicate it to the
[1:26:03] pope I'm not trying to have another
[1:26:05] place that can be just like all the
[1:26:10] rest I didn't want to have a church I
[1:26:12] didn't want to have a place that was
[1:26:14] just like everybody else's I didn't set
[1:26:17] out to be as strange as we ended up
[1:26:19] being but I did not want to have a
[1:26:22] cookie cutter
[1:26:24] church I wanted you to come I wanted
[1:26:27] people to be able to come and never know
[1:26:29] what was going to
[1:26:31] happen we don't always accomplish that
[1:26:34] but I believe we come this morning not
[1:26:36] even knowing not really knowing what was
[1:26:38] going to and we still don't know yet it
[1:26:40] remains to be seen I don't have a lot of
[1:26:43] friends in the ministry uh you're my
[1:26:47] friends in the ministry but I mean a lot
[1:26:50] of preacher friends I'm very very very
[1:26:52] blessed to have brother Dwayne and his
[1:26:55] family as a friend I respect him I have
[1:26:59] confidence in him I honor their lives
[1:27:02] before the Lord I appreciate the times
[1:27:05] that he has spoken into this body he has
[1:27:08] spoken into our young people and to our
[1:27:10] older people and and I don't want him to
[1:27:13] come here today with some time restraint
[1:27:16] or feeling pressure uh it's a rainy
[1:27:20] day we we don't have any thing to do we
[1:27:23] can't do much
[1:27:24] outside and we're going to have lunch
[1:27:26] after a while but it don't matter to us
[1:27:28] whether it's lunch or leer we don't care
[1:27:32] we want God to have his way we started
[1:27:35] having these meetings again after many
[1:27:37] years of not having them every other
[1:27:39] month first Sunday every other month
[1:27:42] first Sunday because there are so many
[1:27:44] folks who stream who watch the services
[1:27:47] here and some of them don't even have a
[1:27:48] local church to go to so they need to
[1:27:51] come they need need to be able to come
[1:27:52] and get revived and filled up a little
[1:27:55] bit and then go back and fight the
[1:27:57] battles that have to be fought to live
[1:28:00] this Victorious Life one of these days
[1:28:02] you're going to look up into the face of
[1:28:04] Jesus Christ and you're going to know
[1:28:08] Hallelujah you're going to know it was
[1:28:10] worth it
[1:28:11] all you're going to know it was worth it
[1:28:13] all Holiness is
[1:28:16] right I want somebody to say Amen
[1:28:18] Holiness is
[1:28:20] Right separation from this world is
[1:28:23] right and you're never going to lay
[1:28:26] something aside or do a little different
[1:28:27] than the rest and and not be rewarded
[1:28:30] and not not when you see what God has
[1:28:33] for
[1:28:34] us You'll wish you had more sacrifices
[1:28:37] you could have made You'll wish there
[1:28:39] were more things you could have done
[1:28:41] because you'll think I've never really
[1:28:43] done anything I remember brother brandom
[1:28:45] saying even toward the end of his I've
[1:28:47] really never done much for the Lord once

[1:28:56] done enough for him he's worthy the lamb

[1:29:13] little prayer I guess are you okay honey

[1:29:32] strain of the
[1:29:34] anointing and it just takes something

[1:29:38] fill your cup again I hope you will give
[1:29:42] your
[1:29:43] everything your faith as our brother

[1:36:21] we're here and I'm not going to go back
[1:36:24] and revisit the things that was during

[1:37:53] I'll share with you something that that
[1:37:55] Heather shared with me this morning um
[1:37:58] but I let me let me share with you out
[1:38:00] of the out of the book of
[1:38:02] Hebrews chapter 11 and verse
[1:38:06] 11 your Bible
[1:38:10] readers know exactly where I'm
[1:38:12] at Hebrews 11 verse 11 reads like
[1:38:18] this through faith yes also Sarah
[1:38:25] herself received
[1:38:27] strength to conceive seed right and was
[1:38:30] delivered of a child when she was past
[1:38:34] age
[1:38:38] because
[1:38:40] because she judged him faithful who had
[1:38:45] promised that's a big because right
[1:38:48] there we have to judge him Faithfully
[1:38:51] [Music]
[1:38:53] the one that gives you the promise there
[1:38:56] is a job for you to do the promise has
[1:38:59] been given you receive the promise
[1:39:02] through faith and judge him come on
[1:39:05] brother
[1:39:06] faithful that the one who gave you the
[1:39:09] promise is faithful to
[1:39:12] fulfill that promise in The Book of Mark
[1:39:16] 11 and verse 24 it says therefore I say
[1:39:20] unto you what things soever ye desire
[1:39:26] on when you
[1:39:29] pray
[1:39:32] believe that's a requirement that's
[1:39:34] right when you pray believe that you
[1:39:37] receive them and ye shall have them God

[1:41:10] didn't I didn't but the message that I
[1:41:14] want to bring to you this morning I told
[1:41:15] you the Lord had given me two words
[1:41:18] three weeks
[1:41:19] ago
[1:41:21] the second word is expectation there you
[1:41:26] go
[1:41:27] expectation the title I if I if I title
[1:41:30] this morning I'd say expecting and it
[1:41:32] shows I think I'm going to be able to do
[1:41:34] without those this morning praise the
[1:41:37] Lord I may not even need too many of my
[1:41:39] notes we'll
[1:41:41] see preacher's here this morning the
[1:41:43] anointing is here yes he is here
[1:41:46] hallelujah praise Lord you know whenever
[1:41:48] you are expecting how how many how many
[1:41:51] come expecting this morning right right
[1:41:54] you're going to have a whole lot of
[1:41:55] babies
[1:41:57] yeah that's the truth see we use the
[1:42:00] term expecting sometimes is anticipating
[1:42:04] something but then we also use the term
[1:42:08] expecting is whenever a woman is with
[1:42:10] child that's right and we say she's
[1:42:13] expecting see I didn't know see the Lord
[1:42:16] had already given me that word before
[1:42:18] you guys ever posted the flyer
[1:42:21] uh and it had mine and sister Heather's
[1:42:23] picture on it and it just so happened in
[1:42:26] that picture she was
[1:42:28] expecting and it
[1:42:30] showed it was clear in that picture that
[1:42:34] she was expecting and I whenever I saw
[1:42:36] the picture I'm like I get it yeah Lord
[1:42:40] I I know I'm on the right track am I
[1:42:42] know I'm on the right track Lord so I
[1:42:45] believe if I if I remember right there's
[1:42:47] either four or five sisters in in the
[1:42:51] church that are expecting somewhere
[1:42:54] around there five that's a good number
[1:42:56] Grace it's a good good number five that
[1:43:00] are
[1:43:01] expecting now to those that have been
[1:43:04] around people who women that are
[1:43:09] expecting they watch things change in
[1:43:12] their lives yes and things start to
[1:43:15] change pretty quickly whenever they're
[1:43:18] with child yes you know a lot of times
[1:43:20] they diet
[1:43:22] changes and things that they used to
[1:43:25] like to eat now they don't like it so
[1:43:28] much or their body starts rejecting the
[1:43:32] things that they're trying to put in and
[1:43:34] the body says no that's not what I need
[1:43:38] that's not what I want and get that
[1:43:39] trash out of here and that's what it's
[1:43:42] what their body will do it will dictate
[1:43:44] to you I can't take that in anymore
[1:43:47] during this time of my life because
[1:43:49] there's a different life that's inside
[1:43:51] of me and the life that's inside of me
[1:43:54] is
[1:43:56] dictating what I can
[1:43:59] consume
[1:44:01] heard the life that's inside of me is
[1:44:05] dictating that I can't eat certain
[1:44:07] things anymore I have to look at
[1:44:09] changing my diet yes sir there's even
[1:44:12] things that
[1:44:14] places that a pregnant woman can't go
[1:44:17] right you go to a a theme park and they
[1:44:21] would have signs that would tell you
[1:44:23] that you know don't ride this ride if
[1:44:25] you're pregnant right you know we got
[1:44:28] restricted U by our by her doctor
[1:44:31] because of things that was going on and
[1:44:33] they're like don't travel right because
[1:44:36] we want you to protect the life that is
[1:44:41] inside of
[1:44:42] you so be careful where you're going
[1:44:46] because we need you to protect that
[1:44:49] right now takes precedence yes whenever
[1:44:52] you're pregnant the life that is growing
[1:44:54] inside of you takes precedence over
[1:44:57] everything you have to listen to that it
[1:45:00] it will dictate what's going on you
[1:45:03] you'll find that you'll Place
[1:45:05] restrictions upon yourself because of
[1:45:08] that life that's inside of you and if
[1:45:11] you you you watch pregnant
[1:45:15] women as they as they
[1:45:18] progress you'll see that their walk
[1:45:23] changes you you'll see that that that
[1:45:26] that maybe they don't walk as they
[1:45:28] normally did they they kind of move a
[1:45:30] little bit and you want to say waddle
[1:45:34] but you hate I know you do I was
[1:45:36] thinking that word I didn't know if it
[1:45:38] was allowed I don't want to be offensive
[1:45:41] but it it's mean it's it's a it's a
[1:45:44] waddle um that that takes place and I
[1:45:48] mean I i' I've watched it um multip
[1:45:50] times in in our home and there is a
[1:45:53] change oh yes in the way that they walk
[1:45:57] yes and that change was because they're
[1:46:01] expecting there's a new life that's
[1:46:03] growing there's an inward change that's
[1:46:05] good brother that starts to make an
[1:46:08] outward expression
[1:46:11] right because of the inward change
[1:46:14] things on the outside will be changing
[1:46:17] as well and there'll come a time you
[1:46:21] know in the early stages of
[1:46:25] pregnancy Sometimes women don't even
[1:46:27] want people to know right they kind of
[1:46:30] hide it they'll they'll try to wear
[1:46:32] clothes that that don't show it exactly
[1:46:35] because there's a there's this little
[1:46:38] window of time that either women other
[1:46:41] people think that maybe she's just
[1:46:43] putting on
[1:46:46] weight or right you don't ask that
[1:46:49] question or is she pregnant and
[1:46:53] sometimes they're cautious on asking
[1:46:55] those because if she's not pregnant it
[1:46:58] could be very offensive oh it looks like
[1:47:00] you're putting on a little bit of weight
[1:47:02] are you pregnant no I'm
[1:47:07] not but see in the early stages it's
[1:47:11] hard to tell that's right that's right
[1:47:14] but you give it a little bit of
[1:47:16] time and then it becomes very apparent
[1:47:20] that there is definitely something
[1:47:22] different about that
[1:47:24] person there is a real life that is
[1:47:27] developing inside of them yes and that
[1:47:31] life is changing them come on now and
[1:47:34] it's becomes very apparent amen and you
[1:47:38] can tell that they are expecting and it
[1:47:40] shows right if you become pregnant with
[1:47:44] the word of
[1:47:45] God sir you say well finally he's going
[1:47:48] to preach now I've been preaching the
[1:47:49] whole time you sure have been preaching
[1:47:52] the whole
[1:47:53] time when we become pregnant with his
[1:47:57] word you'll
[1:47:59] find that there's changes that happen in
[1:48:02] your
[1:48:04] life if you're not finding changes
[1:48:06] taking place I question whether or not
[1:48:09] you have been
[1:48:10] impregnated by the word of God if you
[1:48:14] can still do all the things that you
[1:48:17] have always done oh if you still go to
[1:48:22] all the places that you've always went
[1:48:25] if you can still have the same
[1:48:27] conversations oh that's right it might
[1:48:29] get sticky but if you can still have the
[1:48:31] same kind of conversations that you've
[1:48:34] always had see because when a pregnant
[1:48:37] woman when she's pregnant in that home
[1:48:40] the conversations change the
[1:48:43] conversations are concentrated around
[1:48:46] that life that's right and pretty much
[1:48:49] where she goes at some point the
[1:48:53] conversation is going to start is going
[1:48:55] to twist around and turn to the
[1:48:58] pregnancy and the life that's living
[1:49:01] inside of her yes sir but if we can say
[1:49:04] we can stand here and say I've been
[1:49:06] impregnated by the
[1:49:08] word and yet we don't have any changes
[1:49:11] going on in our life our conversation
[1:49:14] never goes back to the word I question
[1:49:18] that right because I I I know I you get
[1:49:21] around people and it doesn't take long
[1:49:24] just listening to their conversations
[1:49:26] you'll find out what their passions are
[1:49:29] in life it'll either be and nothing
[1:49:31] against those that like sports I'm not a
[1:49:33] huge sports fan if it's there I I'll
[1:49:37] I'll I'll listen to it I'll watch it and
[1:49:39] go see a game but I'm not it's just not
[1:49:41] something that I that I like to go right
[1:49:44] into but there's many people they will
[1:49:47] sit there and they will quote stat after
[1:49:49] stat
[1:49:50] after stat of this baseball player this
[1:49:53] basketball player this football player
[1:49:55] I'll hear them at work and they're
[1:49:56] saying oh such and such game in the NFL
[1:50:00] and that quarterback used to be a
[1:50:04] quarterback for this college team and he
[1:50:06] came from this high school team and
[1:50:08] they're just spitting off names and
[1:50:10] places and I'm like how in the world do
[1:50:13] y'all think of all those things keep
[1:50:15] track of that and then you say something
[1:50:17] about church and they're just like
[1:50:21] oblivious to anything that's
[1:50:25] scriptural and sometimes you can be at
[1:50:30] church and tell things about the
[1:50:34] scripture and the people look at
[1:50:38] you but they can talk to you about this
[1:50:41] video game they can talk to you about
[1:50:45] all sorts of other things but they can't
[1:50:49] carry on a 5 minute conversation of
[1:50:51] scripture that's right but they'll sit
[1:50:54] there and talk to you hours about a
[1:50:57] basketball game come on and they'll sit
[1:51:00] and listen to a basketball game or or go
[1:51:02] to a basketball game and just really
[1:51:05] enter in and they go and they're excited
[1:51:07] about it and then people come to church
[1:51:09] and they're just
[1:51:13] like I wish Pastor Shelly had not told
[1:51:16] him that he could have all day
[1:51:23] it's it's but it's that way it's because
[1:51:26] there's never been a real
[1:51:28] change in their life
[1:51:33] now for you to become
[1:51:36] pregnant with the
[1:51:38] word you must spend intimate time with
[1:51:43] the
[1:51:44] Lord that's the only way you will be
[1:51:48] pregnated by the word is if you have
[1:51:51] intimate time with the Lord you say well
[1:51:55] how you going to back that up I'll give
[1:51:57] it to you
[1:51:59] 1965 God's provided place of worship in
[1:52:03] this great hour that we're living under
[1:52:07] this great expectation that's right of
[1:52:10] the appearing not just of Our
[1:52:14] Lord but the appearing of our
[1:52:18] lover the
[1:52:20] Jesus at any
[1:52:23] time expecting the
[1:52:26] appearance of our lover the Lord Jesus
[1:52:30] now I don't know about
[1:52:32] you but if you are expecting the
[1:52:35] appearance of your spouse tell
[1:52:39] it your
[1:52:41] lover you clean yourself
[1:52:45] up you make yourself
[1:52:48] presentable you you you go and say oh
[1:52:50] you know we're going to go out and have
[1:52:51] a special dinner now well I'm going to
[1:52:55] I'm going to go make sure that I go take
[1:52:56] a shower I wear good good clean clothes
[1:53:00] I'm going to I'm going to sanctify
[1:53:01] myself right because you're expecting
[1:53:06] come on the
[1:53:08] appearance of your lover yes sir and
[1:53:12] people want to come in the
[1:53:14] church with all sorts of trash on them
[1:53:18] come they come to church listening to
[1:53:21] whatever they want to listen to on the
[1:53:24] radio having conversations about who
[1:53:26] knows what I don't want to
[1:53:28] know but their conversations have not
[1:53:32] got them into a place into an atmosphere
[1:53:35] that they can walk in and present
[1:53:37] themsel to their
[1:53:40] lover they come in and they just become
[1:53:42] an
[1:53:44] observer they have not
[1:53:46] prepared
[1:53:48] themselves to experience
[1:53:54] intimacy with Christ right and and I
[1:53:58] don't have it written down but my mind's
[1:53:59] going
[1:54:04] going I think it was it was Joshua I
[1:54:08] believe told them to sanctify
[1:54:12] themselves and preparation to see the
[1:54:16] manifestations to see the
[1:54:18] Wonders come on now sanctify why why do
[1:54:21] they need to sanctify themselves just in
[1:54:24] order to see the wonders of God I mean
[1:54:25] he's God isn't he going to perform
[1:54:27] wonders just because he is
[1:54:30] God but he told them the one place I
[1:54:33] believe it was Moses that told him go
[1:54:35] wash your
[1:54:37] clothes wash wash your clothes sanctify
[1:54:39] yourselves and in preparation and see
[1:54:43] the wonders of the he's talking about
[1:54:45] the on the on the next day watch the
[1:54:47] wonders of God you can't come to God
[1:54:50] just any old
[1:54:52] way your heart has to be clean your mind
[1:54:55] needs to be clean your life needs to be
[1:54:58] clean that's right if you expect
[1:55:01] intimacy that's right with him that's
[1:55:03] good I believe it in in 1954 the message
[1:55:08] expectation brother brandom says now if
[1:55:11] God up there said by his stripes you
[1:55:13] were healed the Holy Ghost entwines
[1:55:17] brings that down by the power of God
[1:55:20] your heart is set on that it says
[1:55:24] yes by his stripes we are
[1:55:27] healed God you said in mark 11:24
[1:55:31] whatsoever things you desire When you
[1:55:34] pray believe you receive it Lord we
[1:55:36] prayed for a meeting we've been fasting
[1:55:38] for a meeting we've been crying for a
[1:55:40] meeting yes Lord I believe the meetings
[1:55:44] on the road all right then stand there
[1:55:47] like oh till the power of God comes down
[1:55:51] when it hitss it says
[1:55:53] yes thought it was amazing last night
[1:55:56] you closed your service singing I'll say
[1:55:59] yes the next man says yes yes look at
[1:56:04] you you got double power yes another yes
[1:56:07] Triple Power yes four times power yes
[1:56:11] first thing you know it becomes
[1:56:13] thousands powers of yes then the holy
[1:56:17] spirit moves in and come confirms the
[1:56:20] word of God with signs and wonders
[1:56:23] following that's it that's what we need
[1:56:27] an
[1:56:28] expectation that's what we need this
[1:56:31] morning is to come in we have prepared
[1:56:34] an atmosphere and now we need to expect
[1:56:37] the miraculous we need to expect his
[1:56:40] presence to come in and fill this house
[1:56:44] and meet every single need but you have
[1:56:48] to be prepared to receive it that's
[1:56:51] right you have to be prepared I I wrote
[1:56:53] wrote this statement down and I I didn't
[1:56:56] come up with this statement and I don't
[1:56:57] remember who I heard it from years ago
[1:57:00] but it said expectation is the breeding
[1:57:02] ground for the miraculous to
[1:57:07] happen expectation is the breeding
[1:57:10] ground for the miraculous to happen when
[1:57:13] you come expecting in faith believing
[1:57:15] God can do Mighty
[1:57:18] things you say well he's God he
[1:57:20] automatically does mighty
[1:57:22] things okay Matthew 13:58 says and he
[1:57:27] did not many mighty
[1:57:30] works there because of their
[1:57:35] unbelief yes he is a mighty working God
[1:57:38] he sure is but we have a part to play as
[1:57:42] well right we have to be prepared we
[1:57:45] have to come expecting we have to create
[1:57:47] the atmosphere and we have to have a
[1:57:50] spirit of belief and acceptance of what
[1:57:53] he's going to do that's right the
[1:57:54] miraculous cannot happen in an
[1:57:57] atmosphere of unbelief that's right you
[1:57:59] hinder the working of God if you have an
[1:58:02] atmosphere of un
[1:58:04] unbelief now God can do whatever he
[1:58:07] wants to do
[1:58:11] yeah he said what was the scripture God
[1:58:14] will work and who will let it right I've
[1:58:18] heard many quote it God will work and
[1:58:20] who will let him or who will allow him
[1:58:22] but that's not what that scripture is
[1:58:23] saying God's going to do a work are you
[1:58:27] going to be the one that stops him yeah
[1:58:29] is it your unbelief that stops him now
[1:58:32] the work will get done but you will you
[1:58:36] will delay the blessings that happen in
[1:58:39] your life that's right you can cause
[1:58:41] yourself to miss out on the miraculous
[1:58:44] that could take place in your life if
[1:58:47] you stand in his way if you do not
[1:58:49] accept and prepare and be ready some
[1:58:53] people say well I I've been waiting on a
[1:58:55] promise a long time and for those people
[1:58:57] I can join in with you right I
[1:59:00] understand what you're going through I
[1:59:02] waited on a promise for a long time and
[1:59:05] it took me a long time to realize that
[1:59:08] it was my fault that that was holding
[1:59:10] the promise up and
[1:59:12] um once I found out once I realized that
[1:59:16] and that became known to me I got myself
[1:59:19] in into a place that I could receive
[1:59:21] what he wanted you know I was I thought
[1:59:23] that I was expecting in the right way
[1:59:26] but I really wasn't all
[1:59:28] right I thought I was going to church
[1:59:31] living my life every day praying asking
[1:59:34] God to perform and I thought that I was
[1:59:36] approaching him in the right way with
[1:59:37] great expectation to see the miraculous
[1:59:40] now he did not withhold all of the
[1:59:42] Miracles out of my family and out of my
[1:59:44] life I saw many miracles we had the
[1:59:47] miracle of Jaden coming into into our
[1:59:49] home the miracle of Savannah coming into
[1:59:51] our home Jaden's Jaden's story is is an
[1:59:54] amazing story in and of itself let me
[1:59:57] just drop this in here right quick we
[1:59:59] started classes for to become foster
[2:00:04] parents the very same day that he was
[2:00:06] born wowow the it was our first class
[2:00:10] that we went and took classes we had no
[2:00:13] clue about Jaden right his birth parents
[2:00:18] were the ones that gave him the name
[2:00:20] Jaden wow Jaden happens to mean Jehovah
[2:00:25] has heard
[2:00:29] wow Jehovah
[2:00:33] heard Jehovah heard my prayer thank God
[2:00:36] thank God thank God and if it had not
[2:00:39] been for the delay I like that Jaden
[2:00:44] would not have been in our home that's
[2:00:46] right but see God knew that that this is
[2:00:49] where he needed to be because he was an
[2:00:52] elected s God knew that Savannah needed
[2:00:55] to be in our home because she's an
[2:00:57] elected
[2:00:58] seed and he allowed me to walk around
[2:01:03] the mountain for a long time all
[2:01:06] right and then whenever we got in the
[2:01:08] right place and everything was right and
[2:01:10] he said okay now listen to me open your
[2:01:14] ears of understanding and listen to what
[2:01:16] I'm telling you yes sir there is more
[2:01:18] that I want to give you
[2:01:19] I want to bless you abundantly far
[2:01:21] beyond you could even imagine and when
[2:01:24] Liam came to our home we were just we
[2:01:28] were ecstatic just
[2:01:30] overjoyed and we thought that was the
[2:01:33] Fulfillment that was the
[2:01:35] completion and then God said you know
[2:01:37] what you've been
[2:01:40] faithful you followed What I've told you
[2:01:42] to do now I'm just going to give you a
[2:01:44] double blessing and he just poured out
[2:01:46] his His blessings upon us again and gave
[2:01:48] mil to to us so I tell you if you really
[2:01:51] get yourself in the right place and then
[2:01:54] expect things to happen we've got to be
[2:01:57] ready first Hallelujah then you can go
[2:02:00] to God and expect things to happen and
[2:02:03] watch them happen praise God psalms 27
[2:02:07] and4 says wait that's a that's a word
[2:02:11] that people do not
[2:02:13] like people do not like the word wait I
[2:02:18] don't like to wait on most anything I
[2:02:22] hate going to a restaurant and sitting
[2:02:25] down and then have to you got to
[2:02:28] wait to get a table and then you have to
[2:02:32] wait for them to bring you something to
[2:02:34] drink and then you drink it really fast
[2:02:36] and you got to wait a long time for them
[2:02:38] to bring you something else to drink
[2:02:40] waiting is difficult for this human
[2:02:43] flesh it's for For Me Maybe it's not
[2:02:45] difficult for you but waiting is is
[2:02:47] something that I struggle with sometimes
[2:02:49] I don't like to wait on the bathroom to
[2:02:52] be available to use I don't like to be
[2:02:55] ready to leave and then have to wait on
[2:02:57] the rest of the family to be ready to go
[2:03:01] when I'm ready to leave I'm ready to
[2:03:04] leave she's not in here that's
[2:03:07] right I'll find I'll get it
[2:03:10] later but the scripture says
[2:03:13] wait and and if you look at that it's
[2:03:15] it's wait in faith that's it wait on the
[2:03:20] Lord be of good courage and he shall
[2:03:23] strengthen thine heart wait I say on the
[2:03:27] Lord the word wait in the Hebrew is
[2:03:30] kaval which means if I pronounce that
[2:03:33] correctly I believe it is kaval which
[2:03:35] means to t y to
[2:03:38] patiently patiently wait there you go to
[2:03:42] look for to
[2:03:44] Hope and to
[2:03:47] expect that's the type of waiting that
[2:03:51] we're to do on the Lord to look for to
[2:03:53] Hope and to expect I have a little thing
[2:03:57] that sometimes the Lord gives me words
[2:04:00] or I'll I'll see words like the word
[2:04:04] what if um I I wrote a thing down with
[2:04:07] about what if worry helps anxiety turn
[2:04:10] into
[2:04:11] fear true good many times we we struggle
[2:04:15] with wh ifs wh if this wh if that what
[2:04:18] if the other
[2:04:19] and uh and the Lord one day I was at at
[2:04:21] my office and i' I'd wrote out the the
[2:04:23] words what if and um then it's just as
[2:04:27] plain as day he he wrote it out for me
[2:04:30] worry helps anxiety turn into fear I
[2:04:35] believe cuz we'll just sit and we'll
[2:04:37] worry and worry and worry and it takes
[2:04:40] that anxiety that you have and that
[2:04:42] anxiety transfers over into fear but on
[2:04:45] the word waight I was I was there and
[2:04:48] this came came to me with Assurance I
[2:04:52] trust that's how I wait with Assurance I
[2:04:57] trust I have an assurance in the word of
[2:04:59] God right I know he's not going to fail
[2:05:02] his word he cannot fail his word I may
[2:05:07] put a damper on him fulfilling it in the
[2:05:10] in the timely manner in my life but he
[2:05:14] is his word will never fail never fail
[2:05:16] never fails cannot Jesus said Heaven and
[2:05:20] Earth shall pass away but my words shall
[2:05:22] never pass away if you look over in the
[2:05:24] book of
[2:05:28] Acts as a brother said the other night
[2:05:30] that doesn't mean that I'm just halfway
[2:05:32] through it just I was getting a little
[2:05:35] warm so I thought I would take it
[2:05:38] off Acts 3 veres
[2:05:43] 2-8 and a certain man lay from his
[2:05:46] mother's womb was carried whom they laid
[2:05:49] daily at the Gate of the temple which is
[2:05:51] called Beautiful to ask arms of them
[2:05:54] that entered into the temple who seeing
[2:05:56] Peter and John about to go into the
[2:05:58] temple asked an arms and Peter fastening
[2:06:02] his eyes upon him with John said look on
[2:06:05] us right and he gave heed unto them
[2:06:10] expecting to receive something of them
[2:06:13] then Peter said sorry silver and gold
[2:06:18] woo Have I None right see that's what he
[2:06:20] was actually expecting from
[2:06:22] them but such as I have give I Thee in
[2:06:27] the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
[2:06:29] rise up and walk and he took him by the
[2:06:32] right hand and lifted him up and
[2:06:35] immediately his feet and ankle bones
[2:06:36] received strength and he leaping up
[2:06:40] stood and walked and entered with them
[2:06:43] into the temple walking and leaping and
[2:06:45] praising God see he gave heed unto them
[2:06:50] the scripture says he gave heed unto
[2:06:53] them with
[2:06:54] expectation to receive something he just
[2:06:57] did not realize exactly what he was
[2:07:00] going to receive he was thinking if I
[2:07:03] could just get a little bit of money
[2:07:05] that'll that'll that'll help me get some
[2:07:07] bread that'll help me make it another
[2:07:09] day but he did not fully understand
[2:07:13] through his expectation what he was
[2:07:15] going to receive that he was going to
[2:07:16] receive Deliverance uhhuh amen he was
[2:07:19] going to receive healing he would never
[2:07:21] have to go and beg
[2:07:23] again he he just reached up to them and
[2:07:26] whenever they reached their hand down to
[2:07:29] him he received a whole lot more than
[2:07:32] just some silver and gold and if you
[2:07:35] have a
[2:07:36] de we have to come with
[2:07:39] expectation we have to cry out yes sir
[2:07:43] we have to call out and expect to
[2:07:46] receive what we have need of Jeremiah
[2:07:49] 2911 see we we have a lot of
[2:07:52] expectations of things but in 29
[2:07:54] Jeremiah 29:11 it says for I know this
[2:07:56] is God I know the thoughts that I think
[2:08:01] toward you sayith the Lord thoughts of
[2:08:03] peace and not of evil to give you an
[2:08:08] expected end see he has
[2:08:11] expectations there's there is a plan
[2:08:14] that he has for you all right and he's
[2:08:16] expecting us to take heed and follow
[2:08:21] that plan that he has for each one of us
[2:08:23] to come to his expected end exactly I
[2:08:27] want to be in his expected end not mine
[2:08:32] cuz mine's going to lead me astray I
[2:08:34] want to move forward in his expected end
[2:08:38] if in that scripture the definition of
[2:08:41] of expected is anticipated awaited hoped
[2:08:46] for watched for if you look at the word
[2:08:49] expecting it says to look forward to the
[2:08:53] probable
[2:08:54] occurrence or appearance of sorry I
[2:08:58] didn't give you those definitions to she
[2:09:00] told me last night if you whatever you
[2:09:02] give me I'll put up on the the board
[2:09:04] they can see it and I failed to send
[2:09:08] that it also means anticipating
[2:09:11] something to occur I love this that
[2:09:15] causes a considerable degree of
[2:09:18] confidence oh yeah oh yeah you really
[2:09:21] trust and believe that it is going to
[2:09:24] happen you know there was there was a
[2:09:26] woman one time with an issue of blood
[2:09:29] right and she cried out if I could just
[2:09:35] touch if I she had an
[2:09:38] expectation she said if I can just touch
[2:09:41] sir the hymn of His
[2:09:44] Garment she she believed because she had
[2:09:48] seen other things take place and she
[2:09:52] said I have a
[2:09:53] need and all I've got to do is just get
[2:09:57] close enough to him just to Touch the
[2:10:00] Hem of His Garment and if I can do that
[2:10:03] I have a great expectation that I will
[2:10:07] receive my healing yes yes because she
[2:10:10] had seen other things take place sir she
[2:10:13] had a high probable belief that it would
[2:10:16] occur for her as well
[2:10:18] all we have to do is reach out to him
[2:10:21] yes sir the healer is
[2:10:23] there we reach out to him in faith
[2:10:27] believing anticipating looking forward
[2:10:30] to a completion of something to happen
[2:10:33] don't just do it
[2:10:35] haphazardly well it might
[2:10:39] work if you come with that attitude it
[2:10:42] won't
[2:10:43] work you can't come into His presence in
[2:10:47] a half and a halfway attitude it has to
[2:10:50] be giving everything it come to him
[2:10:54] trusting believing expecting looking for
[2:10:57] it to
[2:10:59] happen she had
[2:11:02] confidence she had confidence that it
[2:11:04] would take place if she could just touch
[2:11:07] it Noah expected it to
[2:11:11] rain so he built an ark that's right he
[2:11:14] didn't wait until the rain started
[2:11:17] falling that's right amen that's right
[2:11:21] he had been given a a prophecy he had
[2:11:25] been given a message from the Lord
[2:11:26] that's right it's going to rain I'm
[2:11:29] going to destroy this place you need to
[2:11:33] prepare you need to have an ark built
[2:11:36] for the saving of your family that's
[2:11:38] right so he didn't wait to start seeing
[2:11:42] raindrops fall right he took the
[2:11:46] promise and expect expected it to be
[2:11:49] fulfilled and based on that
[2:11:51] expectation he started doing something
[2:11:54] about it he started planning he started
[2:11:57] building the boat if he had waited it'
[2:11:59] have been too late that's right see
[2:12:02] sometimes we receive a
[2:12:04] promise a word is given to you a word of
[2:12:07] Prophecy is given to you or you read
[2:12:09] something in the scripture and you you
[2:12:10] say Lord I believe you're speaking to me
[2:12:12] right there and then we just sat on our
[2:12:14] hands of do
[2:12:16] nothing and we just wait
[2:12:19] but we wait in a lacad isical
[2:12:23] way I'm just going to wait for God to do
[2:12:25] it all no you've got to start making
[2:12:29] preparations for it good that's right a
[2:12:31] couple years ago before before Liam was
[2:12:37] born before we even knew that that that
[2:12:39] Liam was going to be born we were having
[2:12:43] some issues with a
[2:12:44] vehicle and we're like well I think
[2:12:47] we're going to to we going to try to
[2:12:49] trade vehicles
[2:12:51] and at that time Heather liked the it
[2:12:54] was a Toyota Sequoia and my sister and
[2:12:57] brother-in-law had a a sequoia that was
[2:13:00] used and they were going to get rid of
[2:13:01] it and they they made us a good deal and
[2:13:04] and um so we're like okay well we went
[2:13:06] from a minivan to this Sequoia which is
[2:13:10] not easy to work with anyway my opinion
[2:13:14] and um and so we got into that that that
[2:13:18] Toyota and we drove it for just a little
[2:13:20] while brother Steve and I just I I could
[2:13:23] not get past the thought
[2:13:26] that at some point I'm going to need a
[2:13:29] van
[2:13:30] again because I'm believing that God's
[2:13:34] going to give me another
[2:13:35] child and finally I I told Heather and
[2:13:38] she didn't like it at the at the time
[2:13:40] she she and she liked the look of the
[2:13:43] Sequoia and she she liked that and and I
[2:13:46] I said we can't keep this
[2:13:49] car we've got to go back we've got to go
[2:13:52] back to a a van I said there's going to
[2:13:55] be a time that we have to have it and if
[2:13:57] I don't plan for that then I'm
[2:14:00] wrong so we went got rid of the the
[2:14:04] Toyota Sequoia and got went back into a
[2:14:07] Honda
[2:14:08] Odyssey and then after that things
[2:14:13] things transpired and we ended up having
[2:14:15] Liam and then we ended up having having
[2:14:17] me after that and we now we've got got
[2:14:19] out of the The Odyssey we went to a a
[2:14:22] Kia Carnival I told it's it's my
[2:14:24] Carnival of uh it's it's all of my
[2:14:28] monkeys and uh and in my circus and
[2:14:32] we're we ride around in our Carnival um
[2:14:35] uh if we we grow much more it's going to
[2:14:37] have to be something larger uh than that
[2:14:40] to uh keep us but through
[2:14:43] expectation I made
[2:14:46] changes and in and I was like why why am
[2:14:49] I going to a vehicle that would not fit
[2:14:52] us for a growing family and then I can
[2:14:56] and I'm going to walk around and tell
[2:14:57] people that I believe that I'm going to
[2:14:58] have more children listen we should hear
[2:15:00] this if I'm telling people that I'm
[2:15:02] going to have more children right I
[2:15:05] better have my house
[2:15:06] ready and we did we went we bought beds
[2:15:10] we went and made sure that we had things
[2:15:12] ready we we started making true
[2:15:16] preparation in anticipation that's right
[2:15:20] of a fulfillment of the promise true I
[2:15:23] did not have any evidence other than the
[2:15:26] promise right did not have any evidence
[2:15:30] that it was happening it was taking
[2:15:32] place and then it did but see we got
[2:15:35] ourselves in the right place the right
[2:15:38] position we got ourselves prepared and
[2:15:41] we entered in through faith with
[2:15:43] expectation Hallelujah and made oursel
[2:15:46] ready to receive
[2:15:48] what God wanted to do in the Book of
[2:15:50] Daniel
[2:15:52] 3 verse 16-8 Shadrach Meshach and
[2:15:55] Abednego answered and said to the king
[2:15:57] oh
[2:15:58] Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to
[2:16:01] answer thee in this matter I like that
[2:16:03] in other words we ain't choosing our
[2:16:05] words wisely uhuh we don't care if it
[2:16:08] offends you or not right we're not
[2:16:10] careful to answer in this manner if it
[2:16:13] be so our God whom we serve is able to
[2:16:16] Deliver Us from the burning fiery
[2:16:18] furnace and he will deliver us out of
[2:16:20] thine hand O King but if not be it known
[2:16:23] unto thee Oh King that we will not serve
[2:16:27] your
[2:16:28] Gods serve thy Gods I my computer messes
[2:16:32] it up nor worship the golden image which
[2:16:36] thou has set up they were expecting God
[2:16:38] to show
[2:16:39] up they were expecting him to show up
[2:16:43] they said whatever you want to do we
[2:16:45] don't care because we know know that our
[2:16:48] God will our God can Hallelujah and we
[2:16:51] will go toward that fire with
[2:16:54] expectation that even even if you have
[2:16:56] to put us in the fire he's still going
[2:16:58] to show up and he did that's right
[2:17:01] because they were prepared and they were
[2:17:04] expecting and they had made their lives
[2:17:06] ready to receive what he could do that's
[2:17:09] right I wrote this down the other day it
[2:17:11] says a revelation of
[2:17:15] expectation generates a demonstration of
[2:17:19] preparation all right amen that's a
[2:17:23] lot a revelation of
[2:17:26] expectation generates a demonstration of
[2:17:29] preparation if you want to simplify it
[2:17:32] put your faith in
[2:17:34] action if you really believe what you
[2:17:37] say you believe put your faith in action
[2:17:40] start building that boat a ditch on dig
[2:17:43] the
[2:17:44] ditch make the valley full of ditches
[2:17:48] if they hadn't the water was going to
[2:17:50] still come but they wouldn't have been
[2:17:52] prepared for it that's right make the
[2:17:55] valley full of ditches 1964 the message
[2:17:59] when their eyes were open they knew him
[2:18:01] one little sentence out of that brother
[2:18:04] Brown says can you

[2:18:08] expectation of the appearing of Jesus
[2:18:11] Christ all

[2:18:19] of the appearing of Jesus Christ you you

[2:18:36] the Pharisees would go and and tell them

[2:21:27] almighty they get trying to come in the
[2:21:30] door and there's such a crowd they can't
[2:21:32] get through the door but see they knew
[2:21:35] what he needed they knew that he needed
[2:21:38] to be in his
[2:21:40] presence and they said you know what
[2:21:42] well if we can't get to the door we'll
[2:21:45] go up on top of the roof and we'll open
[2:21:47] that up amen what
[2:21:50] dedication what expectation that they
[2:21:52] must have had I mean that's a lot of
[2:21:54] work you're going to carry someone who
[2:21:57] is crippled can't move going to carry
[2:22:00] them up onto the top of a house tear
[2:22:03] things apart and lower them
[2:22:06] down and I'm thinking in their mind
[2:22:08] they're thinking all we got to do is get
[2:22:09] him to them we ain't got to carry him
[2:22:11] back that's right if we can get him in
[2:22:14] his presence we ain't got to worry about
[2:22:16] carrying
[2:22:18] that's the expectation level that they
[2:22:21] had if we could all have friends like
[2:22:23] that cuz sometimes we get into a little
[2:22:26] paralyzed State sometimes in our
[2:22:29] lives Satan will throw things at you and
[2:22:32] it kind of it hinders your walk a little
[2:22:34] bit and you you you feel hindered but
[2:22:37] then if you can have friends around you
[2:22:39] that said you know what you need you

[2:22:52] let's let's play a tape let's let's
[2:22:54] enter in to that presence and come with
[2:22:58] an
[2:22:59] expectation of what God will do all
[2:23:02] right yeah and I guarantee you if you do
[2:23:04] that the atmosphere will
[2:23:07] change and you'll see healings you'll
[2:23:10] see Miracles
[2:23:14] transformed you know sometimes it's um
[2:23:17] it's pretty easy to tell by some
[2:23:19] people's
[2:23:21] attitudes their actions that they really
[2:23:25] are not
[2:23:28] expecting you can you can see it you can
[2:23:31] watch the lives you can watch how they
[2:23:35] talk to you you can watch how they come
[2:23:38] in a service and sit down and you'll
[2:23:40] know they're not expecting anything
[2:23:44] they're just they're they're fulfilling
[2:23:46] maybe to them what they consider is an
[2:23:48] obligation that's right and they're just
[2:23:50] going through motions but they really
[2:23:52] did not come that's right
[2:23:56] expecting if you go hunting you expect
[2:23:58] to
[2:23:59] kill I don't know if any any brothers
[2:24:01] that hunt in
[2:24:04] here no no brothers that hunt oh there's
[2:24:07] a few that okay it's all right I'm not
[2:24:10] I'm not judging you for for hunting
[2:24:13] Carolina yeah yeah no I'm not judging
[2:24:16] you
[2:24:17] you but if you're going to go let's say
[2:24:20] you're going to go bow
[2:24:23] hunting and you tell people I'm going
[2:24:25] bow hunting I want to go kill a
[2:24:28] deer and you show up to your stand
[2:24:31] you've got your bow but you didn't take
[2:24:34] any
[2:24:36] arrows you're not expecting to kill
[2:24:38] anything
[2:24:41] true we went out um Jaden went hunting
[2:24:45] with his grandpa my dad um a couple of
[2:24:49] months ago and and was successful killed
[2:24:52] his killed his first deer and we went
[2:24:55] looking for it he'd shot it and we were
[2:24:58] following the blood trail for two and a
[2:25:00] half hours in the night with multiple
[2:25:03] flashlights following drop by drop by
[2:25:06] drop and it took a very long time to
[2:25:09] find it and we get to it we finally do
[2:25:12] find it and I look at Jaden and I said
[2:25:16] where's the drag
[2:25:18] rope and he said it's at the tree stand
[2:25:23] it's at The Hunting stand I said why
[2:25:25] didn't you bring the drag rope and he
[2:25:29] said I didn't think we would find
[2:25:34] it you didn't think we would find it why
[2:25:38] do you think we spent two and a half
[2:25:39] hours looking for
[2:25:41] it and so then Dad has to take his belt
[2:25:45] off I thought he was going to take it
[2:25:47] off to Jaden at first took his belt off
[2:25:49] and wrapped it around to be able to drag
[2:25:51] the drag the deer back to the truck but
[2:25:53] I'm like why would you even do that if
[2:25:57] you didn't expect that you killed it
[2:26:00] we're going to spend all this time and
[2:26:02] you're telling me I left the drag rope
[2:26:05] all the way back near the truck like no
[2:26:08] if you you pull the trigger and you're
[2:26:11] you're going to go look for it you see
[2:26:12] you hit it make sure you have all the
[2:26:14] proper equipment with you when you go so
[2:26:17] you don't you don't don't have to take a
[2:26:19] belt off and then walk walk back that
[2:26:22] way it just it blew my mind whenever he
[2:26:25] told me that well I didn't expect that
[2:26:26] we'd find
[2:26:28] it I did I mean that's why I spent that
[2:26:31] that length of
[2:26:32] time he was honest he was
[2:26:36] honest amen let's go let's go to the
[2:26:40] book of
[2:26:41] Hebrews
[2:26:44] 11 verse 6 says but without
[2:26:48] faith it is
[2:26:51] impossible to please
[2:26:54] him for he that cometh to God must
[2:26:57] believe that he
[2:26:59] is and that he is a rewarder of them
[2:27:04] that diligently seek
[2:27:06] him that's telling me that I have to
[2:27:09] come with
[2:27:11] expectation I have to come with
[2:27:13] expectation in the message expectancy
[2:27:16] 195 53 brother Brown says and if you
[2:27:18] come expecting to get help from God God
[2:27:22] will meet your
[2:27:24] expectancy he always does I love always
[2:27:31] he always does wherever you go whatever
[2:27:34] you do what you expect brings your faith
[2:27:39] Hallelujah brother Brandon would say
[2:27:41] many times people usually get what they
[2:27:44] expect they come into a service and
[2:27:46] they're expecting this or expecting that
[2:27:47] he said you usually get what you expect
[2:27:50] in in the Book of John 1 verse
[2:27:55] 14 says and the Word was made flesh and
[2:27:57] dwelt among us and we beheld his glory
[2:28:00] the glory is the only begotten of the
[2:28:03] father full of grace and truth 1963
[2:28:07] Christ is the mystery of God
[2:28:13] revealed says and remember we are now
[2:28:17] as his
[2:28:18] bride
[2:28:20] pregnated with his spirit amen amen oh
[2:28:25] my the church bearing Children See
[2:28:29] pregnated by his spirit with his name
[2:28:33] bearing his name bearing his life right
[2:28:39] bringing forth the signs of his
[2:28:43] life evident with the pinenes
[2:28:47] evidence of his resurrection that's
[2:28:49] right showing that he is not dead but
[2:28:53] alive forever more what what is showing
[2:28:57] that the signs that you're
[2:29:00] doing that's that's showing that he's
[2:29:04] alive this is eternal life and
[2:29:07] Vindicated vindicates to the world that
[2:29:10] we are alive in Him Praise the Lord
[2:29:14] praise the lord we are alive in him yeah
[2:29:18] you may not be able to see when you and
[2:29:21] and some people this is It's is hard for
[2:29:24] them somebody will come into a into a
[2:29:26] church or they come into Christ they
[2:29:29] they they're they're new in into the
[2:29:31] body of Christ and and Christ starts
[2:29:33] dealing with their life and they they
[2:29:36] accept God they accept him as their
[2:29:39] savior they receive the baptism of the
[2:29:41] Holy Spirit and you say well I can't see
[2:29:46] VIs visible
[2:29:47] evidence that God is doing something in
[2:29:50] their life yet give it
[2:29:53] time give it time they're a new they're
[2:29:56] a new
[2:29:57] babe let him
[2:29:59] grow let him work let him do the work
[2:30:03] that's in their life because if they are
[2:30:06] truly with
[2:30:07] child if they have received his seed
[2:30:10] that's good brother sir it may take a
[2:30:13] little
[2:30:14] time not every one of the sisters that's
[2:30:17] in this church that have had children
[2:30:20] all present the same once they get
[2:30:25] pregnant some take longer to
[2:30:30] show there there's some that you they
[2:30:33] they show really quickly right and and
[2:30:37] people will notice I believe she's
[2:30:39] pregnant right there's a glow about her
[2:30:42] or there's a little more more belly
[2:30:48] about her I'm trying to be very cautious
[2:30:51] with the words that I
[2:30:57] use but some take a little bit longer to
[2:31:01] show they may go all the way through
[2:31:04] first trimester and almost to the end of
[2:31:06] the second trimester before you really
[2:31:09] see that outward appearance that would
[2:31:13] indicate that they're pregnant
[2:31:17] others and in some after you've had one
[2:31:20] or
[2:31:21] two sometimes it shows earlier but not
[2:31:25] everybody is the same whenever they
[2:31:28] natur I'm talking natural pregnancy not
[2:31:30] everybody's the same and not everybody's
[2:31:33] the same with our spiritual
[2:31:37] pregnancy not everybody grows at the
[2:31:39] same rate in the same Pace they are
[2:31:42] going to be
[2:31:43] growing oh yeah they have to be growing
[2:31:46] that's
[2:31:49] right I don't want
[2:31:51] to I I'll get in
[2:31:54] trouble say too much on
[2:31:57] that I'm growing too but I'm not
[2:31:59] pregnant um not I'm pregnant with his
[2:32:03] word
[2:32:09] um y'all forgive my Folly in the Book of
[2:32:12] Luke chapter 6 verse 43 3 through 45 for
[2:32:17] a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt
[2:32:23] fruit neither does a corrupt tree bring
[2:32:27] forth good fruit right for every tree is
[2:32:31] known by his own fruit for of thorns men
[2:32:35] do not gather figs nor of Bramble Bush
[2:32:39] gather they grapes a good man out of the
[2:32:43] good Treasure of his
[2:32:44] heart bring bringeth forth that which is
[2:32:47] good and an evil man out of the evil
[2:32:51] Treasure of his heart bringeth forth
[2:32:53] that which is
[2:32:55] evil
[2:32:56] for of the abundance of the heart his
[2:33:00] mouth
[2:33:02] speaketh too many people say one
[2:33:06] thing and live another
[2:33:10] thing they'll profess one thing and they
[2:33:13] don't possess what they profess
[2:33:17] they live one life and they try to say
[2:33:20] that they believe and that they trust
[2:33:22] God but the life that they're living
[2:33:24] does not match up with the profession
[2:33:26] that they're
[2:33:27] saying Matthew 15: 7-1 says ye
[2:33:34] Hypocrites well did Isaiah isaas
[2:33:37] prophesy of you saying this people
[2:33:40] draweth nigh unto me with their
[2:33:43] mouth and honth me with their lips right
[2:33:47] but their heart is far from me come on
[2:33:53] in
[2:33:54] vain they do worship
[2:33:56] me he acknowledged that they were
[2:33:59] worshiping
[2:34:00] him but they were worshiping in vain
[2:34:04] teaching for doctrines the Commandments
[2:34:07] of
[2:34:08] men and he called the multitude and said
[2:34:11] hear and understand not that which goeth
[2:34:14] into the mouth defileth a man but that
[2:34:18] which cometh out of the mouth defileth a
[2:34:22] man if you don't put the right stuff in
[2:34:25] the wrong stuff is going to be coming
[2:34:28] out you've got to put the right stuff in
[2:34:32] there's a lot of people that are just
[2:34:34] like the Pharisees today that fulfill
[2:34:36] the scripture second Timothy uh 3:5 says
[2:34:39] having a form of
[2:34:41] godliness having a form of godliness but
[2:34:44] denying the power
[2:34:46] thereof from search from such turn
[2:34:50] away and I wrote a note that says it's
[2:34:52] too late to be playing
[2:34:54] church we ain't got time to be playing
[2:34:57] church we have no time to be playing
[2:35:00] church at
[2:35:04] all Paul had a testimony in Corin to the
[2:35:07] Corinthians he said in my speech and my
[2:35:10] preaching was not with enticing words of
[2:35:14] man's Wisdom but in demonstr ation of
[2:35:17] the spirit and of power if Christ is
[2:35:20] formed in you and we say that Christ is
[2:35:22] being formed in us how many believes
[2:35:24] that Christ is being formed in you if
[2:35:26] Christ is formed in you you will do the
[2:35:30] works of
[2:35:32] Christ that is a testimony that Christ
[2:35:36] is truly being formed in you when you
[2:35:39] start doing the works of
[2:35:44] Christ
[2:35:47] in
[2:35:48] 1965 invisible Union of the bride of
[2:35:51] Christ brother brandham
[2:35:53] says now we School our Seminary students
[2:35:57] in all kinds of Bible theology and
[2:35:59] things like that man-made theology it's
[2:36:02] got a bunch of church just
[2:36:06] exactly a Leota like God said it would
[2:36:10] be oh my when I look at that it makes me
[2:36:14] shiver pregnant ated with intellectual
[2:36:21] conceptions and I'm not telling you that
[2:36:23] this is just in the
[2:36:25] world this is in the ranks of the
[2:36:27] so-called message cly truth they have
[2:36:30] become pregnated with
[2:36:33] intellectual right conceptions that's
[2:36:36] right he said you've got to be a high
[2:36:39] school graduate before you can even
[2:36:41] enter you've got to have got to stand
[2:36:43] before a psychiatrist before you can be
[2:36:46] ordained on would you imagine Peter
[2:36:49] James and John going before a
[2:36:53] psychiatrist remember that 120 up there
[2:36:56] couldn't even sign their own name stand
[2:36:58] before a psychiatrist see if if all
[2:37:01] their their reflex was just right and so
[2:37:04] forth he said they had a
[2:37:08] reflex but it wasn't an intellectual
[2:37:11] conception or scientific research it was
[2:37:15] through the power of God when it struck
[2:37:18] them and I love this they know nothing
[2:37:22] to do but act out what the Holy Ghost
[2:37:27] said
[2:37:28] do they couldn't help it they didn't
[2:37:31] know what else to do just act out what
[2:37:35] the Holy Ghost said do they didn't pay
[2:37:37] any attention to any intellectual what
[2:37:40] the church said and what the priest said
[2:37:42] and what this said and that said they
[2:37:45] moved
[2:37:46] by the
[2:37:48] spirit moved by the spirit sir Fearless
[2:37:51] men 1 John 2:15 he said if you love the
[2:37:55] world or the things of the world the
[2:37:57] love of God is excuse me not even in you
[2:38:02] see so how can you be pregnated with the
[2:38:06] word of God which condemns the world
[2:38:10] condemns Hollywood condemns all of its
[2:38:13] Fashions condemns all these parties and
[2:38:16] carrying on and so called that they have
[2:38:19] in the name of religion it condemns it
[2:38:23] he said how can you be pregnated you
[2:38:25] can't be
[2:38:27] pregnated Christ is not going to
[2:38:31] impregnate a body that's full of
[2:38:34] sin ain't going to
[2:38:36] happen can't happen you must be clean
[2:38:40] must be chased yeah you've got to be
[2:38:43] clean to receive him it's the only way
[2:38:46] it's going to work he he will not
[2:38:49] impregnate the something that is full of
[2:38:52] the world yeah it has to be it has to be
[2:38:56] the same as him he has to place his
[2:38:58] Spirit within you
[2:39:01] right we have we have a spirit his
[2:39:03] Spirit has to be placed within you for
[2:39:06] them to then pregnate you with the word
[2:39:09] of God but people just they go on living
[2:39:12] any old life that they want to
[2:39:14] live but my Bible says what communion
[2:39:17] hath light with
[2:39:18] Darkness what Concord hath Christ with
[2:39:21] Bal see they're pretending to be
[2:39:25] Christians like people pretend things in
[2:39:28] in roleplay games these live roleplay if
[2:39:32] anybody's ever read about these
[2:39:33] different live that people actually go
[2:39:36] and they'll they uh do live roleplay
[2:39:38] they'll dress up in all types of Garb
[2:39:42] and reenactment things and and um and
[2:39:45] act like they're this
[2:39:47] character they'll take on all sorts of
[2:39:50] things about them they'll learn
[2:39:51] languages that's supposed to be for that
[2:39:54] character and they'll present that and
[2:39:56] they they just I don't know it's
[2:39:58] confusing to me uh I have a difficult
[2:40:00] time just being who I'm supposed to be
[2:40:02] not trying to pretend I'm somebody else
[2:40:06] if you're going to pretend I don't I
[2:40:08] don't say you need to pretend let me let
[2:40:09] me change that if you're going to role
[2:40:13] play find you character in the
[2:40:17] scripture and follow
[2:40:19] that if you feel like you've got to do
[2:40:22] roleplay games or something like that
[2:40:24] follow that find find yourself in the
[2:40:26] scripture and follow that live up to
[2:40:29] those standards don't live up to these
[2:40:30] things that's going on in the world
[2:40:33] don't don't find yourself consumed with
[2:40:34] those things that's going on in the
[2:40:36] world find yourself in the scripture oh
[2:40:39] yes and dress
[2:40:41] accordingly dress the appropriate attire
[2:40:45] that you're supposed to dress according
[2:40:46] to the scripture speak the language that
[2:40:49] you're supposed to speak according to
[2:40:51] the
[2:40:53] scripture I talked about last night not
[2:40:55] being conformed you know we don't want
[2:40:57] to be conformed we want to be
[2:41:01] transformed there's a there's a word I
[2:41:03] don't know if how many have heard this
[2:41:05] word um uh when dealing with pregnancies
[2:41:09] uh there's a word called
[2:41:11] pseudois and I don't know if anybody
[2:41:14] here is has ever heard heard that word
[2:41:17] anybody one of the brothers in the back
[2:41:19] okay
[2:41:21] pseudois
[2:41:23] is I'll give you the definition it says
[2:41:25] the appearance of clinical or
[2:41:28] subclinical signs and symptoms
[2:41:31] associated with
[2:41:33] pregnancy although the individual is not
[2:41:37] physically carrying a
[2:41:40] baby pseudois in other words it's a term
[2:41:44] called false pregnant
[2:41:46] yes it's referred to as phantom
[2:41:49] pregnancy see my mother went through
[2:41:52] pseudois before I was
[2:41:55] born she went through a time that she
[2:41:59] felt as though she was pregnant she had
[2:42:03] signs things changing in her body that
[2:42:06] caused her to believe that she was
[2:42:11] pregnant different things changing and
[2:42:13] all this and and it was really it was
[2:42:16] all because of her
[2:42:19] mind so she really wasn't pregnant and
[2:42:23] the way that they found out that she
[2:42:24] wasn't pregnant is that she went and
[2:42:27] took a blood
[2:42:29] test and the blood test showed whether
[2:42:33] or not there was true pregnancy or
[2:42:37] not we let that sink in for a
[2:42:40] second well see some
[2:42:44] people have
[2:42:45] signs in their body whenever they come
[2:42:49] into
[2:42:51] church and it starts looking like maybe
[2:42:55] the word has taken place in
[2:42:59] them and there will even be some outward
[2:43:03] appearances right you'll see them change
[2:43:06] the way they
[2:43:08] dress you'll see them change their
[2:43:13] conversation to start matching the
[2:43:16] conversations that's within the church
[2:43:18] body yes you'll see different outward
[2:43:21] signs but whenever it comes down to it
[2:43:25] it's really just a phantom pregnancy
[2:43:29] they are not with child of the
[2:43:32] word all they've done is
[2:43:36] pretended but see in their mind the
[2:43:39] intellectual as we spoke about a few
[2:43:41] minutes ago
[2:43:43] intellectually they believe
[2:43:45] that they've received
[2:43:47] something and they haven't they haven't
[2:43:50] received the seed yet from the word and
[2:43:53] his life is not truly growing in
[2:43:56] them see whenever you when you when you
[2:43:59] become pregnant they they go and they do
[2:44:02] um sonograms
[2:44:05] ultrasounds I was fascinated brother
[2:44:08] Steve to go in and watch the ultrasounds
[2:44:12] being
[2:44:13] taken because see it it I'm I'm sitting
[2:44:16] there in in that room about to Rejoice
[2:44:20] because I'm I'm sitting there I knew I I
[2:44:23] was asking the sonographer questions and
[2:44:26] I knew already knew the answers to it
[2:44:29] but I was like how does this even
[2:44:32] work and she saids well you
[2:44:34] see the image that you're going to see
[2:44:37] on this
[2:44:38] screen is
[2:44:40] presented because the device that I'm
[2:44:44] using is going to send sound
[2:44:46] waves through the body and it's going to
[2:44:50] project the image based on the sound
[2:44:53] waves bouncing off of it and it will
[2:44:56] create an image she said now when we
[2:44:58] look at that image we have what is the
[2:45:00] standard of that image is supposed to
[2:45:03] look like and we base as we study that
[2:45:05] image we base it off of our learning and
[2:45:09] off of our training we know what it
[2:45:11] should look like and if it doesn't look
[2:45:13] like what it says right there then we
[2:45:15] need to call somebody and talk to
[2:45:17] them and I'm sitting there in that room
[2:45:20] and I'm saying yes because when the word
[2:45:24] is preached oh
[2:45:27] yeah the sound waves are coming forth
[2:45:31] you know what the word is
[2:45:34] doing it's an
[2:45:36] ultrasound that's happening in every
[2:45:38] Service as the word Goes
[2:45:41] Forth it reflects off of each one of
[2:45:44] usah
[2:45:46] and it presents an
[2:45:50] image because of the words being spoken
[2:45:54] that voice is being spoken the sound
[2:45:56] waves of the voice is being spoken over
[2:45:59] your life and it's projecting an image
[2:46:03] yes now we've got to look at that image
[2:46:07] that's projecting and then look at this
[2:46:10] image which is our
[2:46:12] standard and if this image that's being
[2:46:15] projected as the word comes forth does
[2:46:18] not match
[2:46:20] up with the image which is they' they've
[2:46:23] been taught is the standard
[2:46:25] image we've got to check up we've got to
[2:46:29] find out what the problem is Right we've
[2:46:32] got to have this is a spiritual
[2:46:34] ultrasound this
[2:46:36] morning the word is going forth the word
[2:46:40] is bouncing off of your life and the
[2:46:43] word itself is going to present an image
[2:46:46] and that image is supposed to be Christ
[2:46:49] prise Lord anything that's unlike himen
[2:46:54] needs to be cut away it needs to be
[2:46:57] taken away as the word Goes Forth it
[2:47:00] shows
[2:47:01] us what is like Christ and what is not
[2:47:05] like
[2:47:06] Christ and it will show that will also
[2:47:10] be a way to find out whether someone is
[2:47:13] truly pregnant
[2:47:15] they think they're pregnant so they go
[2:47:16] in they do an
[2:47:18] ultrasound and they'll check that
[2:47:20] ultrasound through the imagery that's
[2:47:22] that is produced and they'll say yes or
[2:47:25] they'll say
[2:47:27] no but that's what's happening whenever
[2:47:29] you come to church that word is being
[2:47:32] preached and it's Bouncing Off Of You
[2:47:35] creating those the the sound letting the
[2:47:37] sound waves create bounce off of you and
[2:47:40] generate an image and it will tell you
[2:47:43] whether or not you are truly pregnant or
[2:47:46] if it's just
[2:47:48] pseudois or if it's just a false
[2:47:50] pregnancy or if it's just a put
[2:47:53] on you just think that you have received
[2:47:56] seed and you haven't yet and if that's
[2:47:59] the image that P that jumps up on the
[2:48:01] screen and shows us that we haven't
[2:48:04] truly received we need to
[2:48:07] stop and we need to say Lord what have
[2:48:10] what what am I doing wrong yes sir what
[2:48:14] is it in my life that's preventing
[2:48:17] yes the impregnation of the word of God
[2:48:22] right because at the at the stage that
[2:48:24] we are living in right
[2:48:26] now we should be pregnant expecting and
[2:48:31] it should
[2:48:32] show right it should show by
[2:48:37] now I saw sister Jenna the other day
[2:48:39] when we when we came in and I said I
[2:48:42] said God bless you you look pregnant
[2:48:46] and Heather said Twain I saidwhat that's
[2:48:49] the right thing to
[2:48:51] say it to me it
[2:48:54] is but she looks pregnant because she is
[2:48:59] pregnant now it' be awkward if she
[2:49:01] wasn't pregnant and you said you look
[2:49:04] pregnant but see I knew that she was see
[2:49:09] we had a situation at our church that
[2:49:11] that one of the sisters there and some
[2:49:13] of the brothers and different ones would
[2:49:15] say oh well you look really big you look
[2:49:19] really big I'm like y'all that's
[2:49:21] probably not what what she wants to hear
[2:49:24] why don't you just say you look
[2:49:26] pregnant and leave it at that you
[2:49:31] know you could you choose not to but I
[2:49:34] was acknowledging that she was with
[2:49:37] child wow and it was fitting with my
[2:49:40] message so that's why I had to
[2:49:43] acknowledge it
[2:49:49] if you if you bring it back to a a blood
[2:49:52] test this
[2:49:54] morning take it to a blood
[2:49:56] test take it to a blood test and find
[2:49:59] out are you
[2:50:01] truly impregnated with his
[2:50:05] word or not is it just a lot of
[2:50:09] falsehoods going around
[2:50:11] you I don't want it to be that I want to
[2:50:14] know that his word has been born in the
[2:50:18] manger of my heart this morning that's
[2:50:21] right in Galatians 5 19- 25 now the
[2:50:25] works of the flesh are
[2:50:27] manifest which are these adultery
[2:50:31] fornication uncleanness lasciviousness
[2:50:34] idolatry witchcraft hatred variance
[2:50:38] emulations wrath strife seditions
[2:50:42] heresies envyings murders drunkenness
[2:50:46] reings and everybody in the church says
[2:50:50] none of those apply to me none of those
[2:50:52] apply to me and then it kicks in and
[2:50:56] such
[2:50:58] like and that's where we get hit
[2:51:02] sometimes the suchlike right of the
[2:51:05] which I tell you before as I've also
[2:51:08] told you in time past that they which do
[2:51:10] such things shall not inherit the
[2:51:12] kingdom of God but the fruit fruit of
[2:51:15] the spirit is love joy peace
[2:51:20] longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith
[2:51:24] meekness Temperance against such there
[2:51:27] is no law and they that are in that are
[2:51:30] Christ have crucified the
[2:51:33] flesh that's rough yes sir youve
[2:51:35] crucified the flesh with the affections
[2:51:38] and lust if we live in the spirit let us
[2:51:43] also walk
[2:51:45] in the spirit in other words let the
[2:51:48] life that you live match what you
[2:51:52] possess let it the life that you live
[2:51:55] match what you profess this morning the
[2:51:58] more that Jesus is formed in us the
[2:52:01] greater the manifestation of his Spirit
[2:52:04] right there will be a greater
[2:52:07] demonstration of a risen Life of Christ
[2:52:10] and the corrupt works of the flesh will
[2:52:13] fade and drop away thank you
[2:52:16] Jesus are you beginning to show thank
[2:52:19] you Jesus is your life beginning to show
[2:52:22] his life this morning good
[2:52:25] question there should be a visible
[2:52:27] change reflecting on the outside of
[2:52:31] what's happening on the inside 1961 if
[2:52:34] God be with us where is all the Miracles
[2:52:38] and you know theou in your heart that a
[2:52:39] supernatural work has been done by a
[2:52:41] supernatural being when you once drank
[2:52:44] and smoked and lied and you women loved
[2:52:47] the world so much you kept wearing your
[2:52:49] makeup and your long or short hair and
[2:52:52] doing other things you did see some
[2:52:53] people wouldn't read this quote Oh I
[2:52:55] done run him off
[2:52:57] too I thought he agreed with this
[2:53:01] one and doing other things you did and
[2:53:04] you find out there something happens
[2:53:06] that all the devils in Hell couldn't
[2:53:08] make you do it
[2:53:10] again something happened a god of
[2:53:12] Miracles performed
[2:53:15] what did he do changed your vile heart
[2:53:18] changed your desires changed your nature
[2:53:23] a supernatural word by a supernatural
[2:53:26] God made a creature of time to a
[2:53:29] creature of Eternity amen took the world
[2:53:32] out of you and put Christ in you the
[2:53:36] hope of glory and you're filled with his
[2:53:40] spirit and ready to meet him if you're
[2:53:43] not filled with his spirit
[2:53:44] you are not ready to meet him can I say
[2:53:48] it that way if you're not filled with
[2:53:50] his Spirit you are not ready to meet him
[2:53:53] there has to be a new life inside of me
[2:53:57] the old man is gone the old
[2:54:00] desires are
[2:54:02] gone the new life does not feed on the
[2:54:06] filth of the
[2:54:08] world as a pregnant woman her diet
[2:54:11] changes as we become impregnated with
[2:54:14] the word our diet will
[2:54:16] change and you can no longer feed on the
[2:54:18] same trash that you fed on before that
[2:54:22] life became evident inside you it will
[2:54:25] make you sick the spirit of God the Life
[2:54:27] of Christ cannot feed on the trash of
[2:54:31] the world it feeds on the revealed
[2:54:34] present day word that's what it feeds on
[2:54:39] on the revealed present day word if you
[2:54:41] try to eat from some of the old things
[2:54:42] in your your past the new life will let
[2:54:45] you know right
[2:54:46] quick don't agree with it it will spew
[2:54:49] it out it will cause you to spew it back
[2:54:52] up kick the trash out there is a new
[2:54:55] creation that desires the word of God
[2:54:58] the bride of Christ has been impregnated
[2:55:02] Yeah by his word amen and today it is
[2:55:07] Christ that's being formed in you and in
[2:55:12] me and I tell you we should be showing
[2:55:16] by
[2:55:18] now we should be showing by now that his
[2:55:22] word has been born in the manger of my
[2:55:26] heart that's what the lord gave to me
[2:55:28] for you this morning I pray that it is a
[2:55:31] blessing to you and I and I pray that is
[2:55:33] an encouragement to you and if if you
[2:55:35] feel like you know that maybe I'm not
[2:55:39] presenting the way I should be
[2:55:42] presenting that yes I've claimed that
[2:55:45] I've received seed from him but my life
[2:55:49] is not truly matching up whenever I have
[2:55:52] when the word comes forth and it's do
[2:55:54] creating that ultrasound and I look at
[2:55:56] that image that I've yet to
[2:55:59] see my image and His Image perfectly
[2:56:04] aligned if that be the case don't leave
[2:56:08] this
[2:56:09] morning God can come down and he can
[2:56:12] minister to you and he can cut away yes
[2:56:16] he can use his word to cut away the
[2:56:19] things that's unlike him so we can
[2:56:23] produce the true image of Christ which
[2:56:27] is what we're supposed to produce God
[2:56:29] bless you would you stand with me this
[2:56:35] morning maybe as we turn the service
[2:56:38] back over we could just sing that chorus
[2:56:40] once
[2:56:43] again

[3:40:28] pursued we never really chased after a
[3:40:32] close and intimate relationship with him
[3:40:34] if you will do that you will find
[3:40:37] him if you'll tell him Lord I'm
[3:40:41] desperate for something More Than A
[3:40:44] Feeling for something more than a
[3:40:46] sensation I want to know when I lay my
[3:40:49] head on the pillow at night I want to
