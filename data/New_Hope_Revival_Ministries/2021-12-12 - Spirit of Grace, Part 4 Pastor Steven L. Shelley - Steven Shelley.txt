you have some yes remember in the hospital with diverticulitis you went in the in through the emergency room last night and they did a cat scan and the pain has been off the charts meeting with a surgeon later today to see if there's anything they need to do other than the strong antibiotics if his white blood cells come down then they'll know that the body is responding to the antibiotics and i'm i've been right where he is uh i know how painful it is some of you know sister west has suffered as well it's some of the worst pain imaginable but i'm so thankful that the lord uh made a way that he could finally get to the hospital after being sick for several days let's believe the lord to heal him today amen rest their bodies and and minds they were up all night long and uh remember the children too because their schedule is broken sister audrey needs our prayers today uh she is the doctors are concerned about uh her blood count and their concern about her liver so she goes soon for a test to make sure that everything is okay with the liver we want to hold her up to the lord in prayer we want to hold up sister tebow today because she's dealing with some spread we know that god knows that he saw that from the beginning and he knows exactly how to heal her he knows how to lead her and most of all keep her faith yes amen brother branham told us that when we're faced with something like that we have to work diligently to keep our mind on him and believe that you know it doesn't matter what the doctor should say he's he's bigger than all of that yes but i know that this is a heavy thing for her to carry today i want her to be lifted up amen and a sister flo is with her brother so let's hold her up to the lord uh jernigans and pains i i think are traveling i i want

us if you will get ready to come or go ahead and come and get ready i would like to read a scripture to you that the lord just laid upon my heart romans chapter 8 starting in verse 29 for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we say to these things if god before us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is christ that died ye rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword that is as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all of these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord can you say amen to the word of the lord for you today amen amen amen amen brother david mann brother steve shaw

hallelujah [Music] [Applause] praise the lord [Applause] he's so wonderful you may be seated this morning thank you i know that some of you didn't know that uh i was battling this week but you who pray for me every day it shouldn't matter that's great your prayers were appreciated yesterday we put a little something on our private facebook page just because i wanted to make sure i could get here friday night if i would have had to come i wouldn't have made it that i i'm just being honest i couldn't put any weight on my foot and have been on a scooter ever since but after putting that message on yesterday afternoon and you all praying when i woke up this morning i was able to put some weight on that foot and uh i don't want to put any extra on it because i don't want to do anything to damage it because in the years past that's been the problem sunday would come i would make it through sunday preaching in a shoe and then suffer for a few more extra days that i don't have to do that as soon as you started singing this morning as soon as you started worshiping the lord i felt him touch me there's nothing like this atmosphere it's the only thing that got me out of bed this morning was the anticipation of getting in this atmosphere knowing that anything can happen when jesus is being lifted up and glorified and being praised so i have the victory i want you to know that right now i've got the victory we do want to uh update you on zach ellsworth and uh that is that the evidently the surgeon has been in and uh it appears that his bowel is perforated and uh there's not really a blockage there like they thought just the inflammation and the infection from the perforated bowel which could have certainly started with the diverticulitis they want to keep him for up to a week and see if they it will get a little better with antibiotics so the surgery isn't as invasive and we know god can heal perforated bowel he's just done it but brother steve curry we know that god can do that and we're just sorry for the pain and and i'm telling you after uh after having to be in the hospital this week he will be ready to get out i can assure you of that but this is serious business you've got to have you've got to have your digestive system in working order and uh i tell you i uh the lord healed me many times but i did make a good decision and i didn't want to do it but i did make a good decision uh some years back and had my sigmoid colon removed and it really took care of a lot of problems so my heart just feels heavy and gold keeps going out to zach all through the night that god would just raise him up and and heal him i think he's mighty young to have to deal with that kind of a problem you that have suffered like that i know sister kathy understands some of those kinds of things and we you know it's not pleasant but god god's got it he's got it and uh liz elizabeth was just saying that they meant to request prayer also for their neighbor derek he is a cabinet builder oh my and he had an accident with a table saw on friday lost a finger and has some other other pretty serious cuts so we want to ask the lord to undertake for him and i would not do this for anybody else because i don't really feel up to singing but i'm i will do this for sister tevo mama because i love her so much she's asking me she's texting in church folks and i happen to see her i'll sing this for her i sure will yes i will it's a it is nothing but the truth that we have a body hallelujah we have another body and one of these days we're going to step into it and we'll keep that one for a while and uh i don't know if it's the new body or not because brother branham seemed to make us think that it was a even that was a temporary thing that there is a glorified a body waiting on us a new body waiting on us after that but but uh that's like a transportation on the way to a completely glorified body i'm looking forward to it let's sing that my theophany you're gonna have to help me it's not easy to get the breath when you're sitting down like this [Music] one day i'm gonna take a step toward my theophany one day i'm gonna take another step right into my theophany one day i know the final step is gonna set me free my theophany lord i hear it calling me well it's a call and come up a little higher into this perfect word come up a little higher into a gopro love oh come up a little higher soared through the heavenly my theophany sometimes i hear it calling me [Music] well don't you worry little children should death knock on my door don't you know death is but a doorway that leads me to that heavenly shore well over there there's no heartache no sorrow grief or pain just perfect love and endless joy beyond compare one day i'm gonna take a step toward my theophany one day i'm gonna take another step right into my theophany one day i know the final step it's gonna set me free my theophany oh i hear it calling me what's it saying well it's calling come

hear it calling me over the next hill i look oh i see victory around the next curve in the road you know that old devil he's got to flee god's little broad army is marching marching on work to slay

[Applause] oh we got to get to where we can hear it calling us brother branham said have you heard from your theophany brother once you hear from that you'll know without a shadow of a doubt you're in the number you won't have to worry anymore it'll not be any maybe so salvation for you hallelujah it'll be according to romans there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus what a wonderful place to hide in him amen tomorrow is brother david man's birthday let's wish him a happy birthday hallelujah praise god he's a blessing to so many of us did i miss any other birthday or anniversary i looked but i wasn't sure if i was getting them all all right god bless you let's thank the lord for the musicians and all their labor this morning we got to move along hallelujah in the lord wonderful he is so so so wonderful i'm going to move i was going to read start reading somewhere else but i'm going to i'm going to skip over just a bit and i'm going to take us to romans excuse me mark chapter 4 beginning in verse 24. i told brother greeley when he was preaching out that verse i said well you could have preached after all he was supposed to preach today but he's been having coughing a lot of coughing and congestion and trying to get through that stuff and so i am filling in for him today and i'm doing it by the grace of god i'll tell you his grace is sufficient i wanted to hear more than one yeah i said his grace is sufficient i know that people are streaming this service but i'm just going to be real honest with you tell you i'm not going to pull you anywhere today if you want to go somewhere get on board if you don't then just let me know by sitting down being quiet because i will pack up and take my things home so fast it'll make your head spin i a lot of times i have strength and energy to pull you there but i don't today and i'm not under pressure to do so so if you want me to obey the lord i will i'll give you what he's given me but you're going to have to work too this is not your day off amen all right i gave myself a day off tuesday night and had brother branham preach for us not knowing i was going to have to give my day off today give it up but that's okay i don't want brother greenlee i didn't want him to do anything that would make his condition any worse and sometimes you start feeling better you push yourself and you can go back and now sister joyce has picked that up and uh austin i hate to ask you to do well joseph let's get him he's closer joseph would you come and get my handkerchief for me uh i forgot about somebody being up here on the platform you're you're a real fan too you can get right in there without moving anything thank you so much um i believe the lord wants to show us some things this morning if you've got the patience and you've got the pool let's see i'm gonna see mark 4 24. just a moment and he said unto them take heed what you hear with what measure ye meet it shall be measured to you and unto you that here shall more be given i want to read it again because this verse is so similar to other verses your brain may be telling you i'm reading something that i'm not reading so i want you to listen carefully to this verse there are other verses similar but this is where we are today and he said unto them take heed what ye hear with what measure you meet it shall be measured to you and unto you that here shall more be given that sounds so good to me a couple years ago when i used this verse probably for the first time in my ministry had i ever spoken using this verse i read it to you in the amplified bible i'm going to do it again this morning although we're going in a different direction today than we did a couple years ago i want you to hear how it sounds in the amplified it's it's really really helpful and he said to them be careful what you are hearing that's just good advice that was good advice 2 000 years ago when jesus said it but it's probably even greater advice in 2021 when there are so many voices speaking today everybody's got a blog everybody's got a podcast come on now everybody's getting in on the thing i saw an advertisement that said even judge judy has got a podcast everybody's getting in on the podcast people can't stick to what they what they do so everybody's trying to be a voice in your ear and sometimes it's like a bug trapped in there just buzzing buzzing buzzing buzzing all the time come on now he said be careful what you are hearing but this is what i like the measure of thought and study the measure of thought and study you give to the truth you hear the measure of thought and study you give to the truth you hear will be the measure of virtue and knowledge that comes back to you [Music] now some of us don't hear much so we can't really expect a whole lot to come back to us but the measure of thought and study you give to the truth you hear will be the measure of virtue and knowledge that comes back to you and more besides will be given to you who here this is not just listening this is hearing and how important it is to hear father we thank you today that you have given us grace to be here and lord when we're feeling a little out of sort we can really appreciate what you do to help us and when we're scrambling to try to get dressed to get uh from the bed to the to the bathroom we we really then think about all we take for granted and how good you are to help us to be mobile to get around and to live the life that you've given us to live so today it's with gratitude that i i approach you to say lord thank you for your grace today and every day of our lives we are all a very very very blessed people and even in our darkest trial we are filled with the understanding of how good you have been to us i say with the songwriter and the psalm is i have lived in the goodness of the lord what a place to live not only in the land of the living but in the goodness of god so i need your help today lord and i'm depending on you and i'm also depending on your people to put forth the extra pull of faith and all glory and all honor and all praise will go to you it's in the wonderful name of the lord jesus christ we pray and the saints said amen you may be seated any good to every streamer we say god bless you from pakistan trinidad the netherlands vancouver british columbia and uh ireland and uh it looks to me like alberta and uh it's a little hard for from oklahoma from new brunswick from ghana it goes on from where does that say you'll have to forgive me takes me madagascar wow i thought

beautiful uh long island on the coast of africa is a real blessing uh again new brunswick and it goes on and on that's alberta i think and others but we just god bless you and all of your input and some are sharing scriptures of encouragement with us and some are mentioning the songs and they appreciate the songs and they appreciate the liberty that they see in the worship well as anybody knows there's a price to pay to have freedom of worship you have to break through a lot of stuff to get there don't you and you have to really be in a place where it's not outlawed and i'm so thankful this morning we may have many people traveling there may be many out sick but i'm still thankful for the atmosphere of this house and i'm still thankful that we have understood that praise and worship and prayer can get a whole lot accomplished amen so today i want to take you just a little bit further i thought that i would move into something else but i want to go back in order to go forward we have covered six of the seven offices of the holy spirit number six being the spirit of supplication but i found a tremendous and if you're already having struggles staying awake you're going to need to slip out and wash your face this morning you're going to need to go ahead and get that fixed up before we go on um i thought i had covered that and i would move on to the spirit of glory but i found some notes that i had made i wasn't much feeling like making notes so when you get on a roll you better go with it and i have done that many many many times and if jesus carries and i go home i'm going to leave all these for somebody to preach because i have hundreds of pages and i'm thankful for that in times like this but i wasn't expecting to find this section and i tried to talk myself out of it and i said well a lot of folks are traveling and and so but i believe the lord wants me to get there this morning so i gotta hurry and give you a quick review so that we can get over to this place where i want to be today and zachariah chapter 12 and verse 10 we spent some weeks studying on the offices of the holy spirit i don't really like that term offices but i i didn't i just really couldn't find anything that i felt like covered it anymore but you might say administrations there are many many many ways the holy ghost works in our life i mean hundreds of ways i don't think that's an exaggeration but they fall under some headings and that's what i have done in this study was find seven headings and seven places in the bible where particular spirits are mentioned the spirit of life the spirit of truth the spirit of adoption the spirit of holiness the spirit of grace the spirit of supplication and the spirit of glory if you've got that graphic there uh where we where we break down and this this is a review but some of you weren't here for the study number one the spirit of life and that is found throughout the bible go back onto the app you can find the sermons we did on the spirit of life the scriptures will be there the quotes from brother branham will be there and you can just do a bible study a refreshers course but the spirit of life creates or recreates god's divine life in us and then we study the spirit of truth which brings us to a more perfect revelation of god an understanding of god that is more complete than anything we ever experienced in denominational christianity and it takes the spirit of god to unveil god it takes the spirit of god to unveil jesus christ and so i i am not a branhamite i am a son of the living god but i am not ashamed to say that i have recognized a ministry sent from god to help me understand who god is i'm telling you and that's just the why that's just the raken and scratches the baseline there's just so much more piled on top of that that we can understand by revelation because of the spirit of truth operating in a ministry like that but you can't depend on brother branham you've got to depend on the holy ghost in you to bring the spirit of truth to take you because you can hear the message that he brought and get nothing but some little surface level but but the bride when she hears it under the inspiration like we did here why i've heard that sermon preached that sermon listened to that sermon hundreds of times but in listening to it tuesday night i found three things that stood out to me that had never stood out to me before and we only heard half the message and so this is how the spirit of truth operates he keeps on revealing the word to us and we have an absolute and that's the word of god and we have a glorious absolute interpretation of the scripture and that's the message of the hour but one you take that that message of the hour and we have to tail it it just dawned on me that someone asked the question uh about the chinese laundry because i just just said that real quick like and didn't explain it and i guess on a stream it might not but brother branham would tell these stories about the chinese immigrants and how they operated these laundromats and cleaners they couldn't write english they could only write chinese so what they would do they couldn't read they couldn't they couldn't read english so they would get the person perhaps to put their name on the on the paper but they couldn't read what was there so they would take the ticket and tear it jagged like you know how you do when you tear tear a piece of paper they would tear it jagged so that they would give half to the customer and they would keep half and when they come to pick up their laundry they would bring their ticket and they couldn't read what was on it but they could take the ticket of the customer and set it there against their piece of the ticket and guess what it dovetailed and they said oh we're giving the right clothes to the right people and so brother brandon then in a dovetail you know that's in that's in furniture construction and how the old pioneers and you can ask r.j about that he knows how to do that and you take that wood and cut it and make those dovetails and then it you you cut the wood out to receive that dovetail i want you to know you've got one of the finest joints that can be made in furniture making and when you're going around buying antiques you find one that's dovetailed like that you've got something you've got a piece of real furniture and so brother branham talks about the message of the hour he said don't take my word for it what you hear me say in here you take that and put that up against the word of god and see if that won't dovetail with that word and then you've got a sure foundation to stand on now you can't get any fairer than that folks that's not a man saying you take my word for it no matter what the book said that's as fair as it gets and i feel the same way you take what you hear right back to the word and see if it fits so then the holy ghost works in our life as the spirit of adoption and that that means he is working patiently in us until we can be called the sons of knowledge or mature sons i want you to know maturity is what we're after because it's only in maturity that we're going to be christ-liked down here is a bunch of little babies we can't be christ-like we can't hardly live the christ life but as we allow him to mature us i'll just be honest with you one of the ways he does that we just read it in our opening uh text just a moment ago about listening being careful what you hear and how much study and how much you revisit that word of truth that is the measure by which you receive understanding of what you have heard that makes me want to put a little effort in the preaching that i hear then number four the spirit of holiness it causes our relationship to grow into the realization and revelation of his holiness the spirit of holiness does not try to show us how we can be more holy it tries to show us how we can yield more to his holiness and that makes us holy do you follow that all right you're getting slack now the final three that's the first four and they reveal his work in creating the divine life of god in us the last three reveal his power his divine power as he governs our lives to fully develop his character in his bride church the last three offices reveal his divine power as he governs our lives to fully develop his character in his bride church they reveal his power to govern our life so he can fulfill all the purposes of god in us individually as well as corporately in the church do you follow that so number four excuse me number five was the spirit of grace or the first of the final three the spirit of grace it governs the attitudes and actions of the believer who has learned to walk independence on the holy spirit i don't know about you but i need this one a lot lots lots lots and then we came to the spirit of supplication and the the the work of that spirit in our life it's all the holy spirit but the work of the spirit of supplication in our life executes the office of prayer governing the communication between our spirit and god and brother sister this is so important that we keep a clean line between heaven and us all dead cats off the line when you get down to where zachary has been uh last night yesterday evening you don't want to have to get right with folks you don't even want to have to get right with god you want to just be able to call on the lord and know that there's nothing between you and him he hears you and he is moving on your behalf and so it's a good idea to keep everything clean i remember my grandmother telling about how her daughter my aunt who passed away a couple years back fell dead at her feet with rheumatic fever and she said i was so thankful that in that moment i didn't have to go into repenting before the lord or calling anybody on the phone to ask them to forgive me i had kept every one of my accounts in order with god with man and then all i had to do was just say oh jesus help me and help my daughter and i'm very glad to say that that that worked that god did that prayer is a very important part of the life of a christian and we need both the spirit of grace and the spirit of supplication operating in our lives in zechariah chapter 12 and verse 10 he said and i will pour upon the house of david and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplication and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one morning for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness or we could say grief for his firstborn i don't think i gave them these two verses but maybe they can pull them anyway in daniel chapter 9 verse 3 i don't know if you remember or not but daniel was a man of prayer daniel was a man who had prayer as a part of his dna and any time anywhere under all circumstances he knew that there was power in prayer and in chapter 9 and verse 3 daniel said and i set my face unto the lord god to seek by prayer and supplications with fasting and sackcloth and ashes i don't know how you feel about that but my assessment is daniel was serious about his prayer and then in chapter 9 daniel 9 and verse 17 and i've already read these verses with you uh oh a month or so back now now therefore oh our god hear the prayer of thy servant and his supplications and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate for the lord's sake we talked about what is a supplication it is a need it is an entreaty a plea for mercy a petition it is a serious request for the favor of god to fall in your life when we are anointed to pray when we are filled with the spirit of supplication then we're not praying according to our wants and our wishes and our desires but we are praying in the spirit and i i want you to know as we talked about some time back you can pray in the spirit in both english and in an unknown tongue praying in the spirit doesn't mean always praying in tongues it means either praying in english or praying in tongues but i encourage you to operate what god has placed in you when he placed in you the holy ghost and that is to come to a place where you are so yielded to the spirit of god in prayer that he prays through you you're no longer doing the work but he is praying through you in a wonderful way i wasn't going to read that this morning so i didn't turn it in but let me find that verse just for the record let me read that to you just a moment here uh i have gone through and highlighted what i wanted to talk about today but in uh in romans chapter 8 and verse 26 and 27 he said likewise the spirit and i would say this is part of the working of the spirit of supplication in our life likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself that is the kind of prayer the bride must be involved in in the last days the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is in the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of god that's why spirit prayer prayer in the spirit is such an important part of the christian life because we know when the spirit is praying either in english or in tongues when the spirit is praying i want you to know this is not totally fair for some of you because you only pray in church well this isn't going to mean a whole lot to you but you that have adopted prayer as your privilege and your responsibility you're praying every day and that doesn't mean you're getting down on every time on your knees it means you are making sure to call on the lord because every time you do your spirit connects with his and there's a communication that takes place that's out of this world it's out of this world there's nothing in this world that can compare with that kind of communication direct communication between god now when we taught this and began studying this then we looked at the tripartite man and we don't have time to do that today but let me just say that the spirit of supplication comes to establish us in a prayer relationship with god so that we can commune freely with him and there's going to be times that you approach him as one of his sons but in the flesh in your own mind you feel you need to pray and you begin to pray you think about prayer and you pray there's nothing wrong with that because if you've kept a good communication line open you start praying after your own thoughts and the holy spirit takes over he takes over and he begins to do the praying for us and through us and my what a blessing that is communion with god isn't just it doesn't just mean saying a prayer at certain times it involves living a life of prayer and without the holy ghost that's nearly impossible prayer does not have to be time spent in your closet although i can't emphasize enough the importance of quietly waiting on god but prayer can happen anywhere you are prayer simply put is talking with god whether it be in the spirit or in the understanding talking with god is how your relationship with him is built stronger are you listening here prayer is talking to god even when we can't talk out loud my spirit can talk to god at any time and in any place doesn't have to be vocally we've got to learn to cultivate a spirit of prayer as we live our lives in ordinary daily situations we must learn to yield to the spirit of supplication and he will bring us into vital relationship with holy spirit remember this god is excuse me i want to read it exactly like it was written remember this to the degree that god is on your mind coming up out of your spirit controlling your thoughts is to the degree that god is working in your life i don't think you heard that let's do it again to the degree that god is on your mind coming up out of your spirit how often is god even on your mind i don't want to start into that some of you are a lot more connected to instagram and you are to holy spirit that's not to condemn you that's to tell you that right around the corner all of that is not going to mean a thing because you won't be able to feed your family by instagram no if that's going to be the source of all your information people use it for their news they use it for their little canned spirituality they get their little little thought quotes you know and they present that and they use that and they present really it makes people hypocrites a lot of the time it makes them causes them to present something about themselves it's just not the way it really is we have known people in the past and uh we're just thinking about some of them the other day we've known people in the past that the only room that they kept with any kind of neatness at all was the first room of the house if you move past the first room you saw the filth that they really were living in we had a preacher here one time who who loved gotti he loved gaudy he and his wife they just were very colorful a little bit extravagant kind of people and they like to have gold uh paint and everything just really really really really nice and that was wonderful as long as you're only in two or three rooms but when you got down to how they really live where their kids slept that's when you found the piles of dirty diapers that's when you found the hot dogs that had dried up and thrown been thrown in the corner and left there so you see that kind of a that kind of a spirit existed before social media but social media just gives us a way of being able to fix one corner of the room and not show what's really going on in our life so i'm telling you what prayer has got to be more important than any other thing in your existence any other thing in your existence it has to be i'm not against social media i use it every day i'm going to use it as long as they let me use it i'm going to use it because i understand that it's a powerful tool to witness to speak to people that you would not have an opportunity to speak to them about do it in truth tell them the truth they don't need to hear what they need to hear what they want to hear i mean they don't need to hear what they want to hear they need to hear what they need to hear and i'm not talking about vaccines because you're wasting your time if you want to witness and share a message of truth you ought to do it about the things of the kingdom of god because you can get your politics right and have your attitude toward the kingdom keep you out hello ah my you'll help me now to keep me off of any of that to the degree god is on your mind coming up out of your spirit controlling your thoughts is the degree that it is to the same degree that he is working in your life so if your thought life is not being overrode overridden overwritten by the spirit of god if you're not allowing the spirit of god to help you correct your thought life if you're not allowing the spirit of god to come up out of your life bring you into a place of prayer and worship then i want you to know something you're disconnected you're disconnected god doesn't have any grandchildren come on this is a pretty serious thing in the message believing god ephesians 6 18 said praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints in the message believing god paragraph 107 brother branham said so therefore that's the reason said the prayer of faith shall save the sick an individual's prayer the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much he said oh if you only knew that in your hand christ gave us the authority with his name by being christians the most powerful weapon the world has ever known prayer it even changes what does it change it changes everything i hope sister tebow can hear that prayer changes everything he said it'll change the mind of god it did do it after death was pronounced to a man he prayed god told the prophet go back and tell him i have heard him in the message expectation he said prayer is the key he said that's the answer prayer changes things prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the control of human beings you've got control of the most powerful weapon ever created prayer and we won't use it we can't get away from the tv long enough to use it and we hold the greatest power the world has ever known we hold the authority to use that anytime we need to it's in our hands most powerful weapon ever put in the control of human beings he said there's no atomic bomb no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer prayer will change the mind of god did you know this or did you know that he said it he it did it one time and in the message expectation paragraph 11 same sermon he goes on to explain that it happened in the life when hezekiah was told by isaiah the prophet and he goes on so you can go back and look at that a little bit later paragraph 11. now in uh in proverbs chapter 20 we're going to get into what i wanted to talk about today in proverbs chapter 20 verse 27 it said the spirit of of man the spirit of man is the candle of the lord searching all the inward parts of the belly the spirit of the lord is excuse me excuse me the spirit of man is the candle of the lord searching all the inward parts of the belly what in the world does that mean let's look at it in the amplified he said the spirit of man that factor in human personality which proceeds immediately from god is the lamp of the lord searching all his inner most parts the spirit of man that factor in human personality which perceives immediately from god is the lamp of the lord searching all the innermost parts he operates in our spirit he uses our spirit as a torch as a candle as a lamp to search every other part of who we are we preach by the word that the spirit and this is what brother branham said in the message we listened to tuesday night the greatest battle ever fought he explained to us in that message that the spirit was the inside of the inside and god wait a minute i'm waiting on you to wake up folks i'm going to wait on you just a little while this morning let's let's just do something to st why don't we stand let's stand up most of the time i will drag you but i'm not doing it this morning i love you but i'm not going to do it maybe you're embarrassed to go out and wash your face i'm going to call you by name next that's when it's going to get real serious so go now while you have an opportunity go wash your face get yourself woke up because i have something i need to deliver to you today and god may be running a test this may be a test because of what i'm fixed to talk about so let's just do whatever we have who can come and lead us in jumping jacks does somebody need to do that what do we need to do then flow our arms around i know what it's like to be sleepy i get sleepy when i'm sitting in my chair i don't get sleepy in church i'm too busy but i get sleepy when i'm sitting in my chair come on and you might as well say praise the lord while you do it because your hands are in there i'm not trying to be mean i'm not trying to be mean i'm just telling you i appreciate every penny you give me i appreciate every bit of tithe you pay it's half with the church i only take half of it but you don't pay me enough to drag you to god's word on a sunday morning while you sleep when i felt like being at home today no no no no no and when people are over like this that's sleep folks that is sleep you're not checking your eyelids for cracks then somebody said where's this in the message where's in the scripture listen the pastor is the authority of the church and i'm telling you that in a lot of love and respect i am not going to drag you this morning tuesday night i might be 100 i might feel good no pain in my body and i may drag you again but today i'm not going to do it you're going to help me or we're going home you in me oh you're so mean well i don't want to be i'm here to try to help you i got something i want to share with you i don't i think by how how you're approaching already i'm not sure you're going to make it through the rest but i'm going to believe god that you will i'm going to believe god that you will you're ready to sit down now okay go ahead we've got to learn to yield to the spirit of supplication it's part of what will bring us into a vital relationship with god god communicates through his words we communicate through how do we communicate let me let me say it again god communicates through words how do we communicate through words we absolutely do words are thought carriers they are you can tell what is on a person's heart by listening to their words you believe that i want to get that out we can know the father's will by knowing the father's words brother branham said the will of god is revealed in god's word and the right interpretation of the word is revealed by god bringing that word to pass so father communicates with us through written word and through rhema word which is inspired spirit word like some of the exhortation that we were hearing this morning we take information god's holy spirit falls on that information and gives us revelation and when we have revelation we can then apply it so information revelation application there's a process there's a process you have power in the realm in which you live you are a spirit and you have dominion in the spirit realm as well as in the natural realm but you got to live in that realm you've got to make a choice i'm not going to live my whole life in the natural i'm going to live my life also in the spiritual realm amen i want you to watch your spirit effective communication is when the message conveyed by the sender is understood by the receiver in exactly the same way as it is intended i'm getting to something i'm getting to something the enemy is the master of poor communication see i can tell because i picked up a spirit on a man and his wife here the wife first and just and then the man later in this service this morning and i know that in order for that to happen there had to be a misunderstanding of what was being said because there was nothing being said that should cause someone to respond in a bad spirit it ought to be your desire to create an atmosphere this morning that god's word could go for and you ought to be fighting with me not against me but with me because we're in this fight together so i want you to know that one of the ways the enemy operates in the last hour is by breaking down communication when people think wrong they believe wrong and when people believe wrong somebody said it over here they act wrong when you think wrong you believe wrong when you believe wrong you're at wrong look at what proverbs 23 7 said we're going to get somewhere proverbs 23 7 said for as he thinketh in his heart so is he eat and drink saith he to thee but his heart is not with thee you you might not know by what he says that his heart is not with you because sometimes he says the right things but he pulls in another direction we got some of that around here we need god to help us deal with it as a man thinketh in his heart so is he eat and drink saith he to thee but his heart is not with thee that word thinketh for as he thinketh it means to calculate it means to reckon it means to split or to open up something now this is not just a casual thought here this is as a man really thinks in his heart what's really going on in his thought process whatever that is that's who he really is right so we can't change who we are by changing our environment but we can change who we are by changing our thoughts now you're helping me just a moment thank you everything starts with a thought everything starts with a thought remember this to the degree that god is on your mind you heard this coming up out of your spirit controlling your thoughts is to the degree that god is working in your life your life will never change automatically how many of you'd like some change in your life don't don't don't say you do if you don't how many of you like some change in your life but don't sit there and act like you've got it all together oh you'd be a lot more help to us if you did it won't change by itself it don't change automatically how many of you found out vacation don't change your life changes your you know it helps oh don't don't misunderstand me it helps but it don't change your life come on a new job don't change your life oh that was life-changing oh that was so life-changing i went to this conference and it was so life-changing did you know the converse didn't change you if you changed it all you changed your thoughts if you changed your thoughts you changed your life if something caused you to think differently your life was affected by that that's that's where change listen changing your thoughts is the very key to all change there is no change possible without the changing of our thoughts if your mind don't change your life won't change are you helping me change your mind change your words change your words you change your life i can say it 11 dozen different ways i've got about 30 different expressions here but i'm not reading them all watch your thoughts they become your actions and your actions eventually become the way you walk out your destiny so what your actions that chose your destiny path it was the way you're thinking about it whether you live your life in the permissive will of god or in the perfect will of god hinges today on how you think that's good preaching this is what the enemy tries to use against us let me let me ask you this what causes us to have the mood we have you folks don't believe that you all said you thought i know you don't believe that yes i do brother shelley we're good you're one one in a million because here's what i hear i had a rough day today i woke up this morning with a lot of things go on my mind a lot of things going on and uh uh it just put me in a bad mood i went to make my smoothie and i forgot to put the lid on good so i shot smoothie here and yawn i had about that much left in the cup so i went to work hungry i knew if i didn't clean up all the mess the ants were going to take over my world you just put me in a mood or maybe it was like me i just made that up but i've had it happen uh maybe it was like me the first first night or so of hanukkah there was it a sunday yeah we had lit the candles and then the kids come over was was that a was that a volleyball night or something i don't remember but we had all those hanukkims up on the mantle and i thought you know it's just making uh we've enjoyed it as a family it's making a mess and i know you're really not supposed to blow them out but i am gonna i'm gonna clean this mess up while my wife is gone oh lord of mercy did i ever regret it i could not get up to this one so i stood up in the chair to get to this one and i didn't know that she had sat on top it's a crystal one that my mother had given me but you can hardly get candles down in it so she had put these little votive and i didn't see it i wasn't paying that much attention i just wanted to try to keep from making a mess and i grabbed that and i started moving it toward me well guess what happened it was not the first night because there were three there were three so it was the second night all of them fell right on me one went down in the cushion of the couch and i could see the flames licking up and then the other two were full of hot wax the wax covered my leather chair the floor the coffee table that is a real mood buster but guess what i i said i can't let that change my mood thank god the house i said oh thank you jesus the house didn't burn down it could have burned down i took a picture i texted my wife i said i sure do have a mess i was still working on it scraping on it when she got home she got the vacuum to help me scrape up but listen i just made it i could have burnt the house down i could have burnt my chair i could have burnt my face it could really have made my move but i decided i'm not going to let that put me in a bad mood because your moods are not created by your circumstances your moods are created by your thoughts as a man thanketh in his heart so he is you've got to understand the only way to change your mood people say to me i just can't get glad because you want me to get glad i can't just forget like nothing ever happened i can't just get over that that fat change your thoughts you'll change your mood and your changing of your mood will help change your life somebody said this don't sound like the word to me it sounds so much like the word i'm sorry i didn't know it 30 years ago it sounds exactly like the word exactly like the message to think my life will never change it'll always be this way what kind of mood you think that'll put you in but changing your thoughts will change your mood and that will help change your life there's something in neuroscience or at least neuroscientists came up with this uh with this term we talk about ants all the time automatic negative thoughts but there there is a term in neuroscience called a negativity bias let's say it together negativity bias i i don't have a good arm for baseball but i could throw most anything in reach and hit somebody this morning i could probably do it with a hanky who has a negativity bias you don't have to be around somebody long to pick up on the fact that their bias is negativity it's like a prejudice it's what a bias is i'm not going to ask you because i know you've got a bias for trump so i'm not gonna ask you about biden because i know your your personality your your uh favorite what you really stand for is is president trump this is how you look at it so i'm not gonna discuss that with you and i'm just using that as an example but we're talking about a bias of negativity sometimes racism causes people to have a bias and sometimes uh let me see if i can get the right word uh reverse that's that's it sometimes reverse racism can cause you to have a bias so that every news event that happens is racial you got a bias you see racism everywhere you look come on now there is racism but i don't see it everywhere i look i see it in blatant flaming reality in many places but just because a white man is accused of a crime or a black man is accused of a crime doesn't necessarily scream to me racism or reverse racism come on now we let a bias and a prejudice sometimes uh cloud our judgment on everything now you know that's like uh that's like uh women drivers i've known some awful ones let's see if i can get it stirred up in here i've known some awful ones and it has caused me to struggle a little bit with a bias i'm not the only one that's how i feel so comfortable saying this so if i see a woman if i excuse me sorry if i see a vehicle up ahead of me doing this my mind see that tobias i got to get work on my mind says that's a woman driver right there i guarantee you that's a woman she's either putting on her lipstick or texting it's it's backfired on me i have pulled up there sometime and that woman had a mustache sometimes she had a long beard i said she's not fooling me that's a bias i'm using that as an example that is a bias just because you see a car running off the road doesn't mean it's a woman doesn't mean it's a black person just cause you see a car loaded with people doesn't mean it's mexican people i'm gonna i'm gonna keep on giving you an example that you can relate to we get this in our head and it don't matter how many men you see driving like women i mean driving oh terrible got your attention now so now i know how to do it you you just don't matter you've learned better you've seen it's not always a woman doing it but somehow there's a bias in your mind i'm preaching to you and so that's what a negativity bias is someone who is faster to see the negative than they are to the positive i know folks here let me just ask you a question if you know in your mind this is how you live your life it is easier for you to grab the negative than the positive just go ahead and hold up your hand let us see you now we would all have stones to throw but the truth is you shouldn't throw stone at somebody who's willing to see who they are and admit it in front of all these folks i'm more worried about those of you who have a negativity bias and didn't raise your hand that's the one i'm worried about because the one who can't see it who can't recognize it who can't admit it is the less likely the least likely to be able to change it they won't even know who you're talking about there are people that will amen amen amen and not even real life issue you're the one i'm preaching about there is a a a great brain guy who wrote a book and he wanted to explain in layman's terms he's not a believer he wanted to write in layman's terms what a negativity bias is and he said i don't know how to explain it so that everybody can grab it but he says i'll try to do it like this someone with a negativity bias has velcro in their brain and they catch everything that's negative someone who has a a positivity bias is like they have teflon in their brain and when something negative comes by they just swipe it off the pan but velcro it catches something negative in the atmosphere are you listening it catches something in the atmosphere and sticks to it the only thing you can do to be helped in that regard is to work on that negativity bias you've got to recognize that that is a part of who you have been it is not a part of who you are and you've got to start reaching for the positive and and there's only one solution and that's gratitude seems to me like the world out there gets a hold of this but the church can't get it gratitude is the key living a life of thanksgiving taking time to thank god for what you have starts putting the teflon on your brain so that the negative thoughts just can easily be wiped out of the pan and they don't stick to you and start becoming a part of who you are we and i'm talking about this battle of faith that we're living in now i'm not just talking about being positive so you can be successful and so that you can do this and so that you can do that and you can attract like-minded people i'm talking about so that you can win the battle the greatest battle ever fought must be won and you can't win it in any other arena but the one that is fought in and that's the mind thoughts create our moods we can't just be happy because somebody said be happy we can't just forgive because somebody said forgive we can't be filled with enthusiasm just because some we can't show interest just because somebody said show some interest like i did this morning but what we can do is make steps in the right direction by making sure that when those negative thoughts stick to us it's like i'm going to tell you something about certain cacti in tucson you can't get anywhere near them a teddy bear you can't get anywhere near them because their tips are sharper than your eyes can perceive they don't jump they're only called jumping but they don't jump the needles are sometimes sharper than what you can see your eye is focusing on something way down the needle you think you have gotten to the tip so you're only gonna first of all what makes us do this it's the same thing that makes a child put their hand on the stove after you've told them it's hot i got to see her myself it's the same thing that makes folks stick their tongue to a flagpole on a frozen day it's that's that's what that's what makes us see how close we can get to that without getting us but what we don't realize is your eyes can't perceive the sharpness of it and before you have ever reached what you see it has stuck you so they call it a jumping cactus it's not jumping it's not moving you're the one moving toward it but it gets you before you can see it there's something about these kinds of thoughts those negative thoughts that hang around us that we are trying maybe to do something about them but before we do they get us because we've entertained them too long that is because we have a negativity bias that's because we're actually biased toward negative things folks facebook will tell you that you just cut all these people out of your life i've been i've read it i've read where preachers have posted it i've been tempted to post it myself life is too short they'll say on there life is too short to deal with people that drain all your life out of you or life is too short to deal with people who are negative all the time and when you leave them that is what facebook will tell you to do you can't do that you can't handle a situation by just completely cutting people out of your life especially those that god has put in your life you read that and you say how i'm going to do that that's part of my family now you can choose who you spend the most time with that is absolutely right but you just can't cut people out without any concern for who they are and how they're connected to you because they're negative what you've got to do is become so filled with faith so full of gratitude that you are a a light bearer [Music] so that you can get in the most negative situation where the whole powwow is negative and you just flip the switch and you just start shining a light that makes a difference it's the only key it's the only key if you think you may have a negativity bias here's the steps you have to recognize that it's there and you have to shift to a moment of gratitude you just start saying lord i'm going to give you thanks i'm going to give you things if you don't and here's the point if you don't everything you hear is going to reinforce the problem it will never do anything to change the situation that's why so many of us keep going back to our childhood we keep going back to what we've already stepped out of because we know how negative that might or might not have been i hear people all the time they're going back to things that mothers said thanks to fathers that listen folks if i lived my life that way i haven't forgotten the things my mother said to me when she was drunk i haven't forgot the things my father said to me when he was walking out the door if i choose to live in those things guess what it'll give me something to lean on the rest of my life to excuse all the things that i cannot change but if i say wait a minute it's true it's true it's horrible it's awful it breaks my heart for you when i hear some of the things that were said to you it reminds me it takes you back but you've got to be in a position in this hour where you can walk back through your life without letting it affect your present god does not always remove every memory of the past because he doesn't want you to forget how far you have come with him he wants you to see who you are today and how grace grace amazing grace has brought you this far [Music] we begin to use this i've seen even in the in the pentecostal and charismatic world they start using deliverance the whole ministry of deliverance as an excuse to live in the past there's not a person in this room that hasn't been wounded by words there's not a person in this room that hasn't been broken in church there's not a person in this room that hasn't been disappointed by other believers but we have to make a decision if we don't we'll stay in a lousy mood all the time because our thoughts will be lousy all the time because we'll be blaming and let me tell you something it's a defense mechanism of the brain because if mama's gone and daddy's gone you can't do anything about what you're carrying they're gone can't go to them can't talk it out can't tell them what you'd really like for them to know in some ways that's a good thing because there's questions that you'd like answers i've met people who found out later in life that they were adopted and they just wanted to i just want to know why i just want to know why i just want to know why i just want to know why i understand the need to know why but if they're gone you may not get the answers that you're looking for you may never have the answers that you are looking for if you live in the past why are you even mentioning these things because these things hinder our communications with god it causes everything we hear to be filtered through our own experience through our own pain through our own bias and therefore there are certain people in your life that can never do better because you won't let them do any better it doesn't matter what they do different you'll never let them be any different than they are because you have a bias that needs to be dealt with by the spirit of god and he wants to in fact that's why he operates in us as a spirit of supplication because he wants to cry out in prayer through us in our lives to push those dead cats off the line he wants to give you romans 8 1. listen romans 8 1 is your verse you ought to hold on to this there is therefore now god doesn't give you condemnation he will give you conviction conviction will cause you to reach up to him and be better condemnation will reinforce your negativity bias and it only makes us more religious condemnation will never make you more spiritual it will only make us more religious and the enemy knows that if the enemy can mess up our communication he can stop the relationship and if he stops the relationship particularly with god then our level of revelation becomes paralyzed we don't grow in the spirit the spirit of truth cannot reveal more of god to us the spirit of adoption cannot pull us closer to god the spirit of grace cannot minister the strength of the lord to us in situations that are painful or harmful or helpful and so we get in a lot of trouble there's a lot of offense that people carry in this hour is anybody still with me good i'm not quite ready to go matthew chapter 13 verse 18 through 23. this is a parable this is getting a lot closer to where i wanted to be this morning it just took me a long time to get here verse 18 hear ye therefore the parable of the sower when anyone heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not this is not the parable of the sower this is the interpretation of the parable of the sower when anyone heareth the word of the kingdom and understand if it not then cometh the wicked one let's stop right there do you get that you get that if you understand the gospel of the kingdom if you understand the preaching of god's kingdom and that's everything in the book it's all about his kingdom his dominion his authority his power his love his grace his mercy the whole revelation of jesus christ is the message of the kingdom you can't have the kingdom without the king you can't have the king until you know who he is it took this message to reveal the king to us so we become citizens of the kingdom in our understanding if we hear the word of the kingdom and we don't understand it it affects us and it affects us in such a way it opens the door for the enemy to come in then cometh the wicked one you need to try to understand what you hear you need to be careful not to assume motives in what you hear like i mentioned earlier in this service someone assumed a motive i could tell by the physical reaction i thought i had a break of that for this week but i could tell by their physical reaction that they received what i just said in a way that it was not intended the problem with allowing that to happen is you open the door when you hear the word of the kingdom and what i was saying was the word of the kingdom oh yes because giving god everything we have when we come into his house that's the bible god deserves our undivided attention the word must have preeminence among us we have to sometimes look over the feebleness of the one who delivers the word but we've got to stay connected to the word of god that's why we're here we didn't come to have a good feeling we came to receive something that will strengthen us this week when the enemy tries to pull us back into negativity by us come on and so that reaction that people have that that sometimes in this church it means someone will will roll their eyes i'm just being honest i want you to hear this because i i have this opportunity now i'm taking it those are the kind of reactions that you have in conversation that is not a proper reaction to have when you are sitting in this house because you didn't get it or you didn't like it you were out of order you take sides with that you are out of order your reaction will not always be running the aisles amen i know that's the truth but if you are sure that you have dealt with that negativity bias then you will at least give the preacher the benefit of the doubt he's not out to harm me with the word he didn't come here today to try to me or break my leg or punish me he came here to try to help me we should ask ourselves am i having this reaction because i'm guilty do i want everybody in the building to know i don't like what's being said because i'm guilty or because i'm trying to build a fan club ask yourself that question because when we when we out in the open when we make it so public that we're opposing what's being said you are so affecting the atmosphere and if you can't receive because of your negativity bias what about the person next to you what about the one behind you what about the one in front of you here's what the word says when anyone heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the wicked one and catcheth the way that which was sown in his heart this is he which received seed by the wayside it's so snatched from you you you say all the preaching i've ever heard in my life shouldn't i be further along shouldn't i be closer to god every one of us should be closer to god by that absolutely we should but do you know why we're not because we didn't understand it all it's not a requirement to understand it all but if we don't understand it we've got to make sure that we don't give entrance for the enemy to come in and steal it we hold on to it and say lord when i'm ready to receive it when i'm ready to understand it let the holy ghost make it real to me don't let me reject it because i've got a problem with the messenger don't let me reject it because i've got a problem in my life that he doesn't seem to understand don't let me reject it because i don't like the fact that someone is looking at me or they are not looking at me because if i do that then the enemy comes in and steals that word and unless i go back and revisit it i've lost i've lost god help us we don't want to lose he goes on to say ah this is he which received seed by the wayside but he that received the seed into stony places the same is he that heareth the word and anon with joy receiveth it that word is an unusual word it's not a mistype it means suddenly but he that receive or immediately but he that received the word into stony places the same is he that heareth the word and immediately with joy receiveth it he said amen he took it applied it to himself let's go on ye ha yet he hath not root in himself had nothing to do with the seed had nothing to do with the sower had nothing to do with his initial reaction but because in himself there's no root there's no depth but dureth for a while for when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word by and by he's offended not the first time but by and by he's offended he wasn't offended immediately he received it gladly he nodded he smiled but after a while because he has no root and here's why he has no root he doesn't read the word of god he doesn't hear the message of the hour he just comes to church so he hears it in church nowhere else there's no root in him it can't go deep down in our inner being because it's only visited when we're in the presence of other folks in church come on we're too busy with all the other things in our life we don't take time for god's word if you're under the impression that only preachers should read the word every day i'm telling you you're going to be sadly sadly short you're going to come up sadly sadly short when we're trying to win this mind battle you cannot win the mind battle when you entertain more negative thoughts than you do with positive truth so you got to throw that out of balance the only way to throw it out of balance is flood your life with god's truth so that you don't allow your offense to steal your seed is that good it is good next verse he also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word and the care of this world he didn't reject it he heard it but the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becometh unfruitful but he that receiveth seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word and understand if it which also beareth fruit and bringeth forth some a hundredfold some sixtyfold some thirtyfold now jesus said the seed was the word the sower was the enemy i want you to tell me what makes the difference what makes the difference in all of these different categories it's soil it's soil and soil is the mind in every one of these situations what made the difference the mind the mindset how it was received how do we change the effectiveness of god's word in our heart in our mind in our life we change our thoughts it's our attitude that determines our atmosphere and our atmosphere determines the effectiveness of god's seed in our lives i don't know if you're still with me or not satan comes immediately to snatch away the word for those who do not understand but in each of those situations it's how you receive it's what your mindset is it's what's going on in your soil that determines whether that word changes you or not did you know that makes your thought process even more powerful than the message you hear not for me yes for all of us now what you can say is it's not affecting us all the same because we're not all the same ground it's almost thorny ground some some was good ground some was some was shallow ground rocky ground the sun the elements of the world the word was the same the word was the same the seed was the same the sower was the same the word was the same the difference was the soil and so if you're if you're saying to me that for me my soil is more important more powerful than the message i hear i'm saying yes because my soil determines how effective that word can be in me did anybody understand that so this is not some false doctrine i'm trying to preach here it's exactly what mark 4 24 said take heed what you hear with what measure you meet it shall be measured to you and unto you that here shall more be given be amplified be careful what you're hearing the measure of thought and study you give to the truth you hear will be the measure of virtue and knowledge that comes back to you and more besides will be given to you who what who here just trying to decide if i how far i want to go it was oddly enough i haven't gotten to where i needed to go but i should have by now it's on me so uh psalms 119 let's get skip here psalm 119 and verse 165 great peace great peace great shalom have they which love thy law and we're not all living that out but we all know that's who we want to be we want to be that how many of it like to be unoffendable i mean really just let it roll off i i believe as believers it's possible the problem with holding on to offense is it clouds everything we hear we hear everything with our offense and so we just keep getting offended that's why people can't forgive and forget and get over it because they keep getting offended about the same thing because they never forgave in the first place they're people in life who never see their part in the play they only see you not doing your part they can never see their own failure to play fair but they recognize yours why because they have a negativity bias the beginning of this year i asked the lord to talk to me about the predominant spirits that affected excuse me i have to take that back it was not the beginning of 2021 it was the beginning of the hebrew year it was probably the end of august and i asked the lord to show me what because i wanted to attack them in prayer what were the two biggest spirits that operated among us as the family of god in this house and the two spirits that i was shown was the spirit of jealousy and the spirit of offense the problem with jealousy is jealous people never see that they're jealous i know one exception i know one sister who has come to me more than one time through the years to say to me i i i battle jealousy and boy i admire that i mean i admire that that makes you want to really pray for somebody and it wasn't husband wife that's easy there's a lot of that that goes on wasn't husband and wife it was just the enemy trying to make this person feel less than and let me tell you this you'll never feel less than by looking at god's word not once you become a holy ghost-filled believer and romans 8 1 is your is your message once you understand there's therefore now no condemnation you will no longer allow god's word to condemn you it will correct you it will convict you it will help you but it will not condemn you you you will not allow the word to condemn you because if you do you'll receive it in the wrong spirit it'll never be able to help you okay that thing of jealousy will get in our life and we will be jealous and and you it can be pointed out and it's almost impossible to see it how does it get on us how does it even start when we spend more time looking at other people than looking at him otherwise there's nothing to be jealous about now you say i just don't believe i just don't believe i've got any jealousy in me whatsoever well then you're you're you're the minority because the lord said the spirit of jealousy and the spirit of offense he also dealt with my heart that it was affecting people's prayer lives because of that feeling you don't really want to feel that way or perhaps you have not yet seen that you've got that operating in your life and so it just hangs over you like a dark cloud there's really no reason for us to be jealous of believers but they get to go on a trip well they get to do this and they get to do that and they get to experience this and they get to have their grandchildren and they get to do the other and they the enemy likes to work that way because it affects us it causes us to be offended at one another and more importantly than that a person that is chronically jealous really is offended with god you allow them to have blah blah blah and go blah blah blah bill blah blah blah and pay blah blah it's not that person you don't understand why god would allow it to be that way somebody said i never thought of it that way you should because great peace have they which loved by law and nothing shall offend them that word offend means to put a snare or a stumbling block in their way [Music] it's referred to a bait stick of a trap used to metaphorically imply that which hinders right conduct or thought that which causes them to stumble into a trap it's a stick of bait it's something that pulls them in isaiah 26 3 is the answer thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind it's not an automatic setting you have to keep tuning back in because the enemy comes to disturb our peace are you with me good i'm nearly done i gotta hurry really gotta hurry i'm not gonna drag this to tuesday night hebrews 12 15. this is what i want you to hear looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of god lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled i said lord i don't have to have an answer to what is the source of jealousy i know how jealousy operates would you please help me to understand how someone can be chronically held in a spirit of offense and the lord spoke to my heart and said the root of the spirit of offense is the root of bitterness if an individual will allow me to deal with the root of bitterness in their life and by that root of bitterness they filter everything they see bitter i always thought that offense leads to bitterness and it probably does but the spirit of offense to deal with the spirit of offense the lord said to me the root of that is the root of bitterness if we if that person if if all peoples can deal with the root of bitterness it breaks the authority of the spirit of offense in their life i want to be free from that a couple years ago at a prayer meeting three four years ago and five years ago now i taught one morning on the spirit of bitterness because god was trying to rescue someone in that prayer meeting that day from the spirit of bitterness and god brought a lesson you can have the notes because we gave them out in the prayer meeting many of you could have been in those meetings and chill many of you chose not to i understand many of you are working some of you could have been and you chose not to and you really missed something because there were some things that god brought out to us and among us in some of those meetings that really helped set an atmosphere when we got to the house of god hebrews 12 15 looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of god lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled bitterness is that word bitterness that's used there is a resentful spirit have you ever recognized that someone resented you yeah and you don't understand what you've done or what you keep doing that causes them to be resent resenting you if you have resentment in your heart towards somebody it causes you to behave in a resentful manner and if you're carrying the spirit of events you begin to think that that vengeance getting them back is the way to break the thing that's holding them you better leave god's work to god come on help me now you're not the venging angel you better let god deal with his children you get in the middle let me tell you something if god is trying to listen carefully now if god is trying to deal with something from this pulpit and you get between this pulpit and the person that god is trying to deal with you are in danger you are in danger we better let god do god's business let him execute vengeance when it's needed and you do what the bible tells us to do pray he one for another in the message 1957 brother branham said may every root of bitterness be grubbed out by god's sharp grubbing hole how many of you are ready for the grubbing hole you're still here revelation chapter four number three is the sermon paragraph nine and the little church i admonish you in the name of the lord jesus to grow in the grace of god hold yourself steady and look towards calvary all the time taking all the roots of bitterness out of your heart and soul that god might use you at any time remember just a few weeks ago when we talked about the the huge percentage of illness that comes from thought life it's not just arthritis there are so many physical maladies physical ailments physical symptoms that are directly related to how we process life which is our thought life and to change our thought life can change our attitude it can change our mood and it can change even the cells of our body i'm done nearly did you know that a lot of us hold the power of healing in our own life god's given it to us did you know the body heals itself physician heal thyself the body has the ability god-given created ability to deal with a lot of the things that we deal with and by correcting our thoughts by taking god's grubbing hoe and allowing him to find any root of bitterness any resentment any jealousy that we have not yet been delivered from letting god deal with that can help us so tremendously [Music] i'm lost some of you god may use you at any time if you ever feel to do something or a revelation or something comes to you strangely something warningly or something be careful satan is as sly and slick as he can be see put it with the word of god and what what else does it say put it with the word of god and consult your pastor this quote does actually say that is there nothing past that god might use you at any time if you ever feel to do something there it is if you ever feel to do i saw how quick you all said no about consulting your pastor thank you thank you thank you that'll give me more time if you ever feel to do something or a revelation or something comes to you strangely something warningly or something be careful satan is as sly and sleek as he can be see put it with the word of god and consult your pastor see you you'd have to at least say hello to me to be able to consult me about what's going on in your life in the smyrna smyrnian church age paragraph 53 the only thing that matter the only thing the matter gets all these little differences away from you little isms and little funny feelings around you for brethren and things like that shake it away don't let no root of bitterness ever get into your soul that's mind will and emotions if you do it'll what canker you right keep love i don't care how much people hate you keep moving you love them anyhow brother perry green used to say you are not responsible to make people love you but you are responsible to love them come on now that doesn't mean compromise with their sin it means let them know when you're ready to turn get your life straightened out get back to where you need to be with god i'm here i am here i am never ever ever going to leave you but we can't walk together until we're agreed that's what the scripture said but i'm there i will be there i will call if you need me you call on me let me tell you something i've been pretty pretty upset with folks at times and oddly enough a need would come up in their life i want you to know if you're if you're trying your best to walk in love toward people you'll forget that so quick it may come back to you later but when somebody's got a need that thing strikes you all you care about is helping that need to be met amen you may have to go back and deal with your own emotions later but a real child of god would never say not them i'm not going to help them i'm not going to do anything for them keep love i don't care how much people hate you you love them anyhow if you can't do that you ain't sealed you've got a loose place yet so come on on back and get that sealed upright good with the blood of christ it'll cleanse you from all roots of bitterness hallelujah christ is the mystery of god revealed the musicians are coming if paragraph 86 if the brother you think he's a little wrong or the sister say lord don't let me never have that root of bitterness spring up cause it'll affect him and it'll take the christ right out of my life that poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred that will just take the holy spirit right away from you [Music] it will run him from the tabernacle here it'll kill the spirit of god drive it away from here hurt your pastor it'll do everything see don't you do that you just wax that much closer together draw up take the buckle as the brother testified a minister here the other night about having a buckle seeing it in a vision just that buckles on the whole armor of god just pull their own tighten up move right up close to one another love one another anyhow talk nice about one another say nice things about one another and then god god will bless you do you know who that brother was that was brother cleveland brother cleveland is the man who testified in the tabernacle about the belt buckle when the picture the supernatural picture was taken i took that supernatural picture in tucson and so many things were going on about that photograph and each person would see it and they would see something different one person said i see a belt buckle and i call brother cleveland from tucson and i told him i've got another picture of that belt buckle you were talking about that night in the tabernacle because in that service where the pillar of fire came down brother brandon was preaching and the lilies grew how many of you know pictures i'm talking about there's a series of pictures and as the pillar of fire came down the perspective of the lilies that were sitting there on the front they got really really large but the position of the camera was not changing but the pillar of fire made a difference and in one of those pictures you can look and see the belt buckle and that was what brother what brother cleveland referenced in the tabernacle that night brother branham said to him i can show you that belt buckle and it represented the buckle of truth it represents what holds the armor on we're putting it on but we got to have something to hold it on and ultimately that is not a truth but the truth let's stand thank you for getting with me it was a long haul but we made it through i feel like the spirit of god is giving us another opportunity to change our lives by changing our thoughts we may not do it it may not be something we can do corporately it may be something we have to do as individuals and then we come together a bunch of changed people and guess what that does it changes the corporate atmosphere now don't you go out of here with a misunderstanding you ask the lord to speak to your heart and help you to understand where we are and what god wants to do in our life regardless of what you're facing you cannot afford to let bitterness keep a root you cannot afford to let jealousy sour your life you can't allow these negative biases negative bias you can't afford to allow that to cause you to see the glass always half empty and never see what god has done maybe it wasn't filled up to the top but how do you think it got filled at all the goodness of god the blessing of god the mercies of god the provision of god if you find yourself this week in a bias of negativity grab it take just a moment to be grateful lord it could be so much worse i want to thank you for how you've touched me i want to thank you for how you've helped me i want to thank you for how you've helped my family how you've moved on their behalf and just watch the rest of that it just starts it just dissipates eventually we fill up our hearts with the word of god and it transforms the way we think all together because we're rebuilding we're renewing renewing our mind we're rebuilding our mind we're taking the mind of christ we're receiving god's word and his word deals with everything that the enemy is trying to do don't ever stand between god and what he's trying to do if you can't be a part you stand back and pray but don't you ever get in god's way it's too late in the hour to be in god's way you want to let him do what he's about to do it's good may get ugly it may get dark it may get a little bit uh uncomfortable but oh what he can do when we trust him he can do so much let's worship before we go today we need healing we need strength we need courage we need understanding and every bit of that's found in the presence of the lord let's worship him i know it got late but let's worship him for just a moment or two see what he has hallelujah thank you

softly i know that most of you get the get the text on friday and if there's anyone that wants to get them and you don't get them all we need is your number and we can add you to the list and the way the the software works i have to you say well i i don't i think some people think well it's just a big group text but the way it works i have to send it each one individually you put it in a software but i have to send it individually to you and so it takes a little while to to go in and make sure you get it and i appreciate all of you who have acknowledged getting it it makes me feel bad if i don't hear from folks for a long period of time i don't want to be that person that sends it when you don't want it but i had a strange uh night thursday night and we had come from a lovely evening at david and ashley's and i like to be invited to david and i enjoyed it so much i appreciated it so much it was one of those things where i kind of dread social events people say they don't believe it about me but if you know me you know it's true and i have to work myself up to get into big gatherings or once i get there i'm doing real good i love to talk so you can usually talk but i i can't say i was just really looking forward to it but i i really appreciated the invitation and we got there as a family and it was the most wonderful evening the home their little home they have fixed up i said you all have got to send sister west a picture she's got to see and they said we want to invite her to come and see it it was so comfortable you like to go somewhere where it just feels comfortable the atmosphere feels comfortable and it felt so comfortable and the food was so delicious i know you're standing up but i've been i've been sitting down today so i can go another hour uh the food was so delicious i thought about that food after i got so sick the next day i said i ought to have a lot of fun with david and tell him i was doing good till i ate your food i don't think i've ever had fried chicken like that it was unbelievable and then they played a game well i don't like games too much i you ever feel too old to play games well i felt that way 25 years ago but they they had a game and they didn't really ask i don't ever remember being asked if i wanted to play in fact i think somebody said that and i said no i'm not going to play but i just they played right where we were sitting so i just played i don't know why i did and i had so much fun fun whoa and i went home feeling so good and i just let them know how much i appreciated the invitation and what a warm evening we had and that night i went to sleep and slept good but i dreamed all night long i had i said at least a dozen dreams i think it'd probably be closer to 15 or 20 dreams and every one of them was dark desperate situations death was lingering around i dreamed about some of my own stuff and i dreamed about being with other people in their stuff and i if i told you some of it you just think i was loony it was so bad until i just found myself thinking there is no need to hope i know what's going to happen it was so obvious in every dream and when i dreamed the next one it was like i hadn't even had a good sign at the end of the first one it was like bat right back into that desperate i saw people in terrible condition physically spiritually mentally emotionally and i already knew in my mind the end so i braced myself each time for it to be worse and all of a sudden every time in different ways jesus walked in amen i only saw him in a few of the dreams but i knew he came in whether i saw him or not because it was like an entirely different end was laid out before me i said oh my what has changed what a shock look what god has done in the last seconds in one of them i looked at my watch and i said he only had three seconds left and it would have all been over but he came in right on time with only three seconds to work he didn't need anymore he didn't need any more than that and he so encouraged me and then i went right back into one of those dark situations again and i wish that in my mind i could have remembered what had just happened in the previous dream but i didn't i got plunged right back down into the desperation of of hopelessness and i saw this nation in a horrible mess it smelled like a cesspool and i thought i can't go on we'll never be able to make it like this we've seen the last of of any stirring because if we stir it all they'll come and shut us down and lock us up that was the dream that was that dream and i couldn't remember that god had just moved in the one before but in the last little bit oh god just came in and he came in i remember particularly in that one he came in in a way i never saw him coming never thought about him using that way never thought about him how he could change things so miraculously in a way i'd never anticipated and i was back up on the mountain and then i'd go right back into another one of those dreams it was only when i woke up the last time as someone pointed out the text was a little late getting getting to him on friday and that was not because i wasn't awake it was because i was trying to write it in such a way that it made sense when i woke up the last time i remembered that every dream had been dark and that god had come through in the last seconds of every dream i woke up many times went to the bathroom and did not remember the bright end but when i woke up from the last dream i lay there and i thought my my every time every time every time no matter how bad it looked you came and oh what a difference you made i'm telling you god didn't let that happen to me all night thursday night and then friday in the day friday morning and then by friday afternoon i could not walk and when i tell you i can't walk couldn't walk that's what i mean i could not walk i could not put my foot on the floor to walk it hurt too bad when i sat in the chair with it up in the air it hurt just as bad as if i was trying to put weight on it and you know what kept me getting through it i said well i didn't dream this but if god could do that in every one of those dreams he can come in hallelujah i feel good now i feel good now if he can do that in those situations he can do that in your situation and some of you are in the dream and some of you were going through some awful things but god turned it around for his glory and i want to say this not just to make it acceptable you know the outcome was okay we can deal with that no no no it was total transformation it was so miraculous and so glorious and so victorious that you couldn't even remember that it had been anything but that that's the god we serve we're going to sing that again and i want you to take your your situation i don't know how many people texted back and said that's right where i am right now i'm in one of those situations right now i've got to see god show up he will he may not come like you want him he may not come when you want him but he's coming he's coming and he's going to turn it around for his glory i want you to go after yours right now maybe it's physical maybe it's spiritual maybe it's emotional maybe it's your family maybe it's your job situation maybe you've got a burden for this church i don't know what you're carrying maybe you need direction maybe you need god to open doors i don't know what it is but it looks bleak it looks nearly hopeless so much so your mind has already determined how it's going to play out you've already seen the end in your own mind you know exactly it's going to get worse it's going to get worse you've got it all played out i want you to give that to god with me right now as we worship i want you to get prepared to give that to god because i'm telling you god's got an another ending to your story he's got another ending to your chapter another chapter another ending to your book god has got another end to the story that you did not see in the first place but god has had it in his heart the whole time and i'll tell you what it looks like it looks like total redemption total redemption and the lord just said tell them for many of them that's their family total turnaround total redemption you don't see how you don't know how it could be but you're holding on and you know that he's able hold on this morning worship him go right back through that song and we're going to go after it before we go home today i know it's late come on [Music] but god but god but god start prophesying that but god because all my life you have been faithful [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] but i'm standing with them right now in faith i believe oh god that you will turn it around for your glory there is no expiration on your promises you are able to do exceedingly and abundantly above we look beyond the darkness we look beyond what it feels like now what it looks like now what it seems like now we
