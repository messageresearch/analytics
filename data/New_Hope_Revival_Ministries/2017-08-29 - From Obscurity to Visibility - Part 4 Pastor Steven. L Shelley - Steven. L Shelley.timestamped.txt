[0:30] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen
[0:33] Shelley and you're watching the Eagles
[0:35] cry I want to welcome you to the program

[0:41] hope perhaps that you're one who watches
[0:44] each and every week on this great
[0:46] Christian network but if perchance this
[0:49] is your first time and I want to welcome
[0:51] you and I want to just tell you what our
[0:53] heart is our heart is to preach to
[0:56] present teach I guess you could hardly
[1:00] call it preaching because we're not
[1:01] standing behind a pulpit but we're
[1:05] sitting here in this chair teaching
[1:08] sharing our heart and the vision is to
[1:11] help prepare and equip you for the great
[1:14] move of the Spirit of God that's coming
[1:16] upon this earth just before the second
[1:19] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[1:21] believe that we're moving into the days
[1:23] of the kingdom and we are so grateful to
[1:27] God for how he has opened up the doors
[1:29] for us to be able to reach you by
[1:32] satellite television perhaps you're
[1:34] watching this as a podcast and if that
[1:38] be the case then we want to thank the
[1:40] Lord for that technology as well what a
[1:43] wonderful way for us to be able to send
[1:46] to you an episode of the Eagles cry that
[1:49] you can download onto your computer and
[1:51] even download right onto an mp3 mp4
[1:55] player and watch it listen any time well
[1:59] we just believe that as we move in to
[2:02] that direction they're going to be many
[2:04] wonderful things taking place and you
[2:06] can keep up with what's going on at New
[2:08] Hope revival ministries by visiting our
[2:11] web page at revival dot o-r-g revival
[2:16] dot org if you prefer to contact us by
[2:19] mail then the address is given to you at
[2:22] the bottom of the screen and we're even
[2:24] willing to take your phone calls now
[2:27] we're here during regular business hours
[2:30] in our part of the world so you're gonna
[2:33] have to make some adjustments to know
[2:35] exactly the right time if you choose to
[2:38] call but we'd be happy to hear from you
[2:40] we're getting prayer
[2:41] Qwest almost on a daily basis and we've
[2:44] been asking for prayer requests for long
[2:47] enough now that we're beginning to get
[2:49] praise reports we're beginning to get
[2:52] testimonies of how the Lord is answering
[2:55] prayer in fact today not necessarily
[2:59] this testimony didn't come because of
[3:01] the Eagles cry but just because of the
[3:04] ministry that the Lord has given us in
[3:06] general but I heard from a mother just
[3:08] today who sent in a prayer request a
[3:11] family that I met many years ago sent in
[3:15] a prayer request for a son that was
[3:17] addicted to drugs very serious drugs and
[3:20] it just seemed like he was going down
[3:23] for the last count and she sent in a
[3:26] prayer request we all sincerely joined
[3:28] with her in prayer and she has sent in a
[3:31] prayer request to say that God has
[3:33] prevailed that Jesus has delivered and
[3:36] set her son totally free from the power
[3:40] of those drugs and we're just believing
[3:43] that God's going to use his testimony to
[3:45] reach others who are in the same
[3:47] condition perhaps you're bound perhaps
[3:50] you have something that is bigger than
[3:52] you are that has control of your life
[3:54] well I want you to know that there's
[3:56] freedom in Jesus I want you to know that
[3:59] he has the power to set even the
[4:01] captives free and we are just believing
[4:04] that your faith will be inspired today
[4:08] as we teach the Word of God to you that
[4:10] you'll just reach up and believe and
[4:12] call on the Lord and that you will
[4:15] experience the same deliverance and
[4:16] liberty in your own life hundreds and
[4:19] thousands of people millions of people I
[4:22] guess would be a more accurate number
[4:24] have experienced the deliverance and the
[4:26] healing power of Jesus Christ around the
[4:29] world and if you have not experienced it
[4:31] for yourself it's not too late you could
[4:34] invite the Lord into your life and I
[4:36] know that he will make a change the
[4:38] Apostle Paul said old things have passed
[4:41] away behold all things have become new
[4:44] and that is what happens when we
[4:47] surrender our lives to follow the Lord
[4:50] Jesus Christ so don't forget to visit
[4:54] our web page
[4:55] contact us let us know that you're
[4:57] watching the Eagles cry and share with
[5:00] us any prayer requests that you have we
[5:02] believe in the power of prayer and we
[5:04] believe in the power of agreement and we
[5:06] want to agree with you in faith and then
[5:09] watch God take over we want to watch him
[5:12] move and when he gets involved he
[5:14] changes things he can change even the
[5:18] darkest circumstance well we want to get
[5:20] right into the Word of God we've been
[5:22] speaking to you on from the Book of
[5:25] Isaiah and the theme has been from
[5:29] obscurity to visibility let's look to
[5:32] the Word of God together and I say a
[5:34] chapter 58 we've been studying these
[5:37] verses together and I don't want to go
[5:40] back and take my time to go through the
[5:42] whole study I hope that you have been
[5:44] able to follow if not again go to the
[5:47] webpage click on and subscribe to the
[5:51] podcast and you can go back and watch
[5:54] the episodes that you've missed I'm
[5:56] excited about being able to offer that
[5:58] to you absolutely free of charge if you
[6:01] have a computer then you can just follow
[6:03] this series all the way through if you'd
[6:06] like to order it on DVD you can do that
[6:08] as well
[6:08] now it's time to preach or to teach I
[6:12] say a chapter 58 and we've been talking
[6:15] about as a theme verse 10 and 11 let me
[6:19] read them to you quickly and if thou
[6:21] draw out by soul to the hungry and
[6:23] satisfy the afflicted soul then shall
[6:27] thy light rise in obscurity and thy
[6:31] darkness be as the noonday the last time
[6:35] we were together we moved in to verse 11
[6:37] and it says and the Lord shall guide
[6:40] thee continually I don't know about you
[6:44] but that's a promise that I need I'm
[6:46] gonna stand on that one for myself right
[6:49] here today that God would guide me
[6:52] continually he said he would satisfy thy
[6:55] soul in drought even when it's dry even
[6:59] when it's barren all around you even
[7:02] when you're living
[7:03] adverse circumstances of darkness and
[7:06] famine spiritually and drought oh he
[7:09] said I will satisfy your soul and make
[7:12] fat your bones swore to promise
[7:15] it speaks of health and and of course
[7:18] spiritual prosperity and we also believe
[7:21] that God is able to bless and provide
[7:23] for our natural needs as well and thou
[7:26] shalt be like a watered garden a garden
[7:31] that has automatic irrigation when water
[7:35] is needed water is provided now doesn't
[7:38] that sound just like the Lord you shall
[7:40] be like a watered garden and like a
[7:43] spring of water whose waters fail not
[7:47] there is no end to the supply of the
[7:51] living water that the Lord Jesus Christ
[7:54] wants to give us in this hour as he
[7:57] moves us from obscurity to visibility
[8:02] now again remember the definition of
[8:04] obscurity is a lack of clearness or
[8:07] clarity it also means a difficulty in
[8:10] being understood and then it also speaks
[8:13] about being little known or perhaps
[8:16] being in the shade and God says your
[8:18] light is going to rise in obscurity and
[8:22] so you may feel very distracted you may
[8:25] feel like you have a difficulty
[8:27] understanding and having clarity in
[8:30] God's Word hearing his voice knowing his
[8:33] will but we're entering into a new
[8:35] season blessed be the name of the Lord
[8:39] and in this season we're believing that
[8:42] God is going to give a special clearness
[8:45] clarity to know the mind of God and the
[8:49] will of God and so we thank the Lord for
[8:52] this great transition I tell a story I'm
[8:55] not sure if I've told it here on the
[8:56] Eagles cry or not but if I have would
[8:59] you bear with me a little bit and let me
[9:01] tell it quickly again some years ago you
[9:05] know I have four children my oldest just
[9:07] turned nine my youngest just turned one
[9:10] years old she's walking all over the
[9:12] house her name is Mariah destiny my
[9:15] oldest is Benji
[9:16] juda and then my second son Joshua River
[9:19] and then our third daughter is our third
[9:22] child which is a daughter Olivia Zion
[9:25] but when I think perhaps Benjamin was a
[9:29] couple years old three years old or so
[9:32] and Joshua was a baby we went to the zoo
[9:34] in Atlanta when I was a little boy we
[9:38] used to visit Zoo Atlanta and even my
[9:41] mother tells me that when she was a
[9:43] little girl she used to visit the zoo in
[9:45] Atlanta Georgia in the United States and
[9:48] there was a special gorilla who lived in
[9:52] the zoo a very young gorilla when my
[9:54] mother was going to see this gorilla as
[9:58] a young girl but as I was old enough to
[10:01] go and see the gorilla was getting older
[10:03] and a few years ago the gorilla died and
[10:06] the gorillas name was Willie B and it
[10:09] was famous there were billboards that
[10:11] said have you been to see Willie B
[10:13] lately and so initially Willie B was
[10:18] kept in a glass cage with some iron bars
[10:22] but as the zoo progressed and prospered
[10:26] they built all such a beautiful habitat
[10:30] for gorillas and their breeding these
[10:32] gorillas it oh it's such a beautiful
[10:35] enclosure and they've got families you
[10:38] know the gorillas are making families
[10:40] and so forth and etc and so anyway
[10:43] Willie B died he was very old and he
[10:47] died and and I think I remember reading
[10:49] in the paper and we get to zoo Atlanta
[10:51] and we're walking around I hadn't been
[10:54] in years but so it all looked new to me
[10:57] and we came across a little area where
[11:00] there was a crowd gathered and we
[11:01] stopped with stop my wife stopped
[11:04] pushing the stroller I think my mother
[11:06] was with us and we wondered what was
[11:08] going on and we realized that we had
[11:10] walked into something like a press
[11:11] conference the media was there and there
[11:14] was a couple people couple gentleman
[11:17] standing and I recognized the mayor of
[11:19] Atlanta and wondered what was going on
[11:22] and all of a sudden I looked and I saw
[11:24] this big clump of something covered up
[11:26] with a black cloth or like a blanket
[11:30] sort of us satiny looking blanket and
[11:33] what we realized was they were unveiling
[11:37] a statue and the artist who had come
[11:41] from somewhere far away had come to be a
[11:44] part of this great unveiling of this
[11:47] great masterpiece and so when the time
[11:51] came the artist pulled off the cover and
[11:54] of course we were just standing there
[11:55] waiting to see what this beautiful
[11:57] sculpture was going to be and it was it
[12:00] was Willie B it was a bronze sculpture
[12:04] of this very famous gorilla but I have
[12:06] to tell you the detail was was
[12:08] extravagant and it was beautiful well
[12:11] anyway it was as beautiful as a gorilla
[12:14] can be and it was exciting III was
[12:18] excited I've never forgotten it several
[12:20] times during the day we bumped into the
[12:22] sculptor and talked to him and he talked
[12:24] to the children and so forth and
[12:26] sometimes in the spirit this experience
[12:31] that I had in the natural will come back
[12:33] to me in the spirit and I've wondered
[12:35] about that why does this come back to me
[12:38] some time I'm in prayer some time I'm
[12:40] worshiping the Lord some time I'm
[12:42] preaching and it comes back to me and I
[12:44] think I've got the answer I think it's a
[12:47] part of this release I hope you don't
[12:50] think I've lost my mind when I say it
[12:53] this way but I think it's a part of this
[12:55] whole release of God bringing us from
[12:58] obscurity to visibility he's working on
[13:01] a masterpiece and the masterpiece is you
[13:05] you're the masterpiece you see I believe
[13:08] according to the scripture that from all
[13:11] of time back wait to the Garden of Eden
[13:15] God has been working on a bride he's
[13:19] building a bride the scripture tells us
[13:23] in Revelation 19 that we should rejoice
[13:25] for the marriage of the lamb has come
[13:27] and the wife or his wife the wife of the
[13:31] lamb hath made herself ready I'm not
[13:35] ashamed to tell you that I have a
[13:36] personal revelation that I am a part of
[13:39] the wife of the heavenly bridegroom but
[13:42] Jesus Christ somebody said well doesn't
[13:45] that sound a little well you call
[13:47] it anything you want to I just want to
[13:49] have a relationship a real one not a
[13:52] religious one you know a couple emails
[13:57] have come in from people who were not
[14:00] critical but giving me a little bit of a
[14:03] warning because I have said a few things
[14:06] about the organized church
[14:08] I'm not against the organized church but
[14:11] I'm against anything that's dead I'm
[14:14] against anything that names the name of
[14:16] Jesus but there's no life to it it's all
[14:20] tradition and ritual that's what I am I
[14:24] am I have to be honest I'm against that
[14:27] and you say why because it's robbing oh
[14:30] here I go
[14:31] it's robbing God's people of the life
[14:34] that jesus promised us for today John
[14:38] 10:10 said I have come that you might
[14:40] have life and not that you would sit
[14:44] somewhere in a dead mausoleum and and
[14:46] reminisce about what God was but he said
[14:49] I have come that you might have life and
[14:52] that you might have it how more
[14:54] abundantly hallelujah I believe in the
[14:57] book of Acts I believe that every Church
[15:00] should be an extension of the book of
[15:03] Acts I believe that the Living Church of
[15:06] Jesus Christ must be more than rituals
[15:09] traditions and icons we've got to be a
[15:13] people we've got to be a body the
[15:16] ecclesia in in Greek is is a fellowship
[15:20] a community of believers who go forth in
[15:24] the power and demonstration of Almighty
[15:27] God and so I I certainly take your
[15:33] thoughts into consideration I hope that
[15:36] you have misunderstood me
[15:39] perhaps I've misunderstood you and and
[15:42] we're just trying to iron that out but
[15:44] I'm not going to change my mind because
[15:48] I've read the book I've read the book
[15:51] and the book tells me this book the
[15:53] Bible the Holy Word of God tells
[15:56] me what church is supposed to be like
[15:59] what it's supposed to look like what
[16:01] it's supposed to act like how it's
[16:02] supposed to function it's supposed to
[16:05] function like the church that was born
[16:08] on the day of Pentecost Shavuot and we
[16:12] read about that birth in Acts chapter 2
[16:15] get your Bible out sometime and read the
[16:18] book of Acts and if you're not
[16:20] experiencing in your life what those men
[16:23] and women experienced then we want to
[16:25] reach up higher I am NOT a cessationist
[16:28] I do not believe that these things are
[16:30] finished and over with and done when the
[16:33] Apostles died I believe that Hebrews 13
[16:36] and 8 is the theme Jesus Christ the same
[16:39] yesterday and today and forever what he
[16:42] did yesterday he's able to do again
[16:45] today
[16:46] what's he waiting on he's waiting on you
[16:48] and I a great let me get back did I go
[16:53] off on a little trail there but I won't
[16:55] take it back because I feel it inspired
[16:57] I feel feel like you need to know where
[17:00] I'm coming from
[17:00] I'm not against any particular church or
[17:03] any particular brand of religion or
[17:06] denomination or whatever and when I say
[17:09] traditional Church I don't necessarily
[17:10] mean orthodoxy I I just mean any group
[17:15] of people that have settled whoever you
[17:18] are whoever we are if we have settled
[17:21] for form instead of power if we have
[17:26] settled for religious function instead
[17:29] of spirituality if we have settled for a
[17:33] painted fire now if you're lost in a in
[17:36] a snowstorm in a blizzard you need more
[17:40] than a picture of a fire in a magazine
[17:42] to keep you warm you need to be able to
[17:46] do more than then find a picture in the
[17:48] encyclopedia and hold your hands up to
[17:50] it and hope that that's going to be
[17:52] enough to keep you alive you need to
[17:53] find the real fire well I want you to
[17:56] know I have found the real fire is a
[17:58] seven year old boy I was baptized with
[18:01] the Holy Ghost and fire that was 32
[18:05] years ago and that fire of God is still
[18:09] burn
[18:10] in my heart and I despise religion I'm
[18:14] looking for reality and I believe that's
[18:17] what's happening behind the veil
[18:19] underneath the sheet or the curtain
[18:22] underneath the sculpture The Grates not
[18:25] sculpture where the sculpture the
[18:28] creation he is the sculptor the Creator
[18:31] I believe that underneath this veil the
[18:34] great sculptor is working on shaping us
[18:38] molding us into his likeness and into
[18:42] his image I heard a great man of God in
[18:45] fact a prophet in this prior generation
[18:48] William Branham talked about going to
[18:51] Los Angeles many years ago and visiting
[18:55] the famous cemetery where many many
[18:57] important people including great
[18:59] Hollywood actors of that era were buried
[19:03] and in that same Forest Lawn Cemetery
[19:05] and in that same place the great woman
[19:10] evangelist healing evangelists Aimee
[19:13] Semple McPherson is buried and many
[19:16] years ago William Branham died in 1965
[19:20] so that's a long time ago but many years
[19:25] ago he said that he visited the grave at
[19:30] the invitation of Roth McPherson Amy's
[19:34] simple Macpherson's son he visited her
[19:38] grave and paid honor and respect to a
[19:40] great woman and they wanted to take him
[19:43] on a little tour of the cemetery and in
[19:45] the cemetery in some of the mausoleums
[19:49] or chapels or whatever you might would
[19:52] find there are duplicates or copies of
[19:57] great sculptures that are housed in
[20:00] beautiful places around the world and
[20:02] one of the sculptures that took brother
[20:06] branham's attention was this great
[20:08] sculpture that Michelangelo did of Moses
[20:14] and Moses is sitting with the tablets in
[20:17] his arms and so forth and and they told
[20:20] brother branham a story that he really
[20:22] liked and he said that when
[20:24] Michelangelo had worked so ferociously
[20:27] hard on making this beautiful sculpture
[20:31] and he wouldn't let wouldn't let anybody
[20:33] see it and he was doing it privately and
[20:36] working many many many many hours of the
[20:39] day and night and he was coming to a
[20:44] place where he was almost finished and
[20:46] one day he was caught in the inspiration
[20:49] of what he had created it it inspired
[20:53] him it looked so real
[20:55] what he had made with his hands and it
[20:58] was almost like he was standing before
[21:01] Moses but it was a sculpture of Moses
[21:05] but it it so took him he was so caught
[21:08] up in the spirit of what he had created
[21:11] with his own hands that he struck the
[21:13] sculpture on the knee leaving a scar on
[21:16] the sculpture he struck it and he said
[21:18] speak he was so inspired and this that
[21:22] had come from his imagination and he had
[21:26] created it with his own hands it became
[21:30] so real it looked so real that he said
[21:34] speak to me speak and you know that's
[21:37] exactly what I believe I believe that
[21:39] behind the veil ho hallelujah I believe
[21:43] that behind the veil the Lord Jesus by
[21:45] the power of the Holy Spirit is working
[21:48] on a bride he's working on a masterpiece
[21:52] he is dealing with our attitudes that
[21:56] are unlike him dealing with the vices
[21:59] and habits of our life that that have
[22:02] control over us instead of us having
[22:04] control over them dealing with the
[22:06] soulish issues of man working on the
[22:09] inside of the inside and and you know
[22:12] what I mean
[22:13] iron sharpening iron and God's knocking
[22:16] off the rough edges of our life and I
[22:18] believe that we're getting ready to step
[22:21] out from obscurity into visibility I
[22:26] believe there's a great generation of
[22:29] people a company of people that are
[22:33] about to step forth in the power in the
[22:35] glory and in the annoy
[22:37] ting of the Lord Jesus Christ finishing
[22:41] his ministry carrying on what he started
[22:46] what he accomplished carrying it on as
[22:49] the disciples came to him and said what
[22:52] must we do that we might work the works
[22:55] of God you know this might work better
[22:57] if I could fold my hands and tie them in
[23:00] my lap or something
[23:01] I probably distract you I'm sorry but I
[23:04] just get a little bit excited sometime
[23:07] when I think about being a part of that
[23:11] and you know it's not pleasant having
[23:13] the blanket over your face but God's
[23:15] doing that because He loves us that he's
[23:17] protecting us and he's working on us in
[23:20] secret but he's getting ready to
[23:23] introduce us he's getting ready to
[23:26] launch us he's getting ready to send us
[23:28] forth into the marketplace into the
[23:31] nation's to accomplish what needs to be
[23:35] accomplished before the end of the end I
[23:37] believe we're living in the end days I
[23:39] believe we're in the end times now and
[23:42] we're making preparation for the end of
[23:45] the end and when I say that I mean the
[23:47] end of what we know is this a world I'm
[23:49] getting ready to go home to live with my
[23:52] heavenly father forever and ever and
[23:54] ever and ever and ever while while ages
[23:57] roll on and when time has surrendered to
[23:59] eternity we're going to still be in the
[24:02] presence of our Creator I want to make
[24:05] it I want to to go home one of these
[24:08] days but not without having accomplished
[24:11] what he has called me the reason the
[24:15] destiny of the purpose for which I was
[24:18] born and you my friend whether you feel
[24:21] great or small whether you feel
[24:23] qualified or disqualified whether you
[24:26] feel sufficient or insufficient God has
[24:29] a purpose and he has a plan in your life
[24:33] and it's time for you hallelujah to get
[24:37] out of obscurity to let the Spirit of
[24:40] the Lord invite you into a place where
[24:43] you can hear more clearly his voice
[24:45] where you can articulate and share what
[24:48] he whispers in your ear great friend
[24:50] the great prophetic man in America his
[24:53] name is Bobby Connor and he says
[24:55] something that I love so much he says
[24:58] that God shouts his truths but whispers
[25:02] his secrets and we want to be able to
[25:05] hear both the shouting the trumpet voice
[25:07] and we want to be able to hear the still
[25:09] small voice that whispers the love
[25:11] secrets
[25:12] to us because He loves us so much and so
[25:16] let me just encourage you to press on
[25:19] hold on with everything that's within
[25:21] you greater is He that is in you than he
[25:24] that is in the world and I know times
[25:26] are tough and things are ugly and the
[25:29] hour looks bleak your body is perhaps
[25:32] suffering maybe you're in pain maybe
[25:35] your family is in a mess maybe your job
[25:37] situation is a wreck but I just tell you
[25:40] I I implore you hold on hold on my
[25:44] friend my brother my sister hold on
[25:46] because the darkest hours just before
[25:49] the dawn a beautiful old anthem of the
[25:52] church hold on my child joy comes in the
[25:56] morning hallelujah and I just feel like
[25:58] telling you that the Lord wants to take
[26:01] your ashes and give you gold and silver
[26:04] I believe God wants to take the darkness
[26:07] of your midnight and cause light to rise
[26:10] in your obscurity I just believe that
[26:13] God wants to turn some things around for
[26:16] you suddenly as you turn your faith
[26:18] loose to believe if we can only believe
[26:24] all things are possible to him that
[26:29] believeth and you know we don't have to
[26:32] know how God's going to do it to believe
[26:35] that he is going to we don't have to
[26:37] understand how the house what trips us
[26:40] up you know and sometimes even the wind
[26:42] but we need to believe that he is he is
[26:45] he is he is the scripture said he is a
[26:48] rewarder of those who diligently seek
[26:51] Him let's seek him like we've never
[26:53] sought him before he will need us
[26:55] because there's two unveilings going on
[26:58] he wants to unveil us to bring us out
[27:01] and he is unveiling him
[27:03] self before us that we could understand
[27:06] him more father I just thank you for the
[27:08] wonderful presence of the Lord that is
[27:11] in this place may it go out may it
[27:14] somehow transfer may it drop down into
[27:17] the home of every person watching this
[27:20] program may may their faith be stirred
[27:23] up and ignited may they not be satisfied
[27:27] with painted fire but seek to find the
[27:29] real fire of the Holy Spirit of God and
[27:32] be changed and transformed in your
[27:35] wonderful lovely name and I pray for the
[27:38] sick right now because you are our
