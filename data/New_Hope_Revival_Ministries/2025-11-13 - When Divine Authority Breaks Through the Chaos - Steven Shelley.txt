Description:
There is a higher court above every earthly system, where justice flows from the Ancient of Days with unshakable authority. When heaviness lifts and peace begins to settle into the places that once felt overwhelming, it’s a quiet reminder that Heaven has moved. True strength rises when His Spirit breathes, when authority aligns with power, and when the heart learns to lean into the One who carries every burden. Those who belong to Him walk in a kingdom where clarity replaces confusion, where chaos becomes order, and where the whisper of “Papa” reminds the soul it’s never standing alone.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
You can have power of attorney, legal rights to conduct business in the name of the person, the grtor, &gt;&gt; the one who has granted you the legal rights to act on his or her behalf. If Jesus is saying, I give unto you a state of control over something by legal rights because we know the whole universe, everything that God created is operating under a legal system. [music] &gt;&gt; It is it's a judicial system. &gt;&gt; It's not earth's legal system. &gt;&gt; It's not earth's judicial system. It's the legal system of the kingdom. There's no doubt in my mind that there is an ancient of days. There is one who sits with a white wig. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; We see him in the book of the revelation, hair white like snow, the glorified Christ. We see him as the as the wigged one also as the ancient of days in the book of Daniel. And he has the the the the authority, NOT ONLY THE POWER and ability, HE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO EXECUTE JUSTICE &gt;&gt; FOR YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; And all you have to do is beseech him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Request &gt;&gt; ask &gt;&gt; and it shall be. Yes, &gt;&gt; a judgment, a justice, a just decision rendered from the legal system of the kingdom. And so anything that happens in earth under the jurisdiction of a legal system is some earthly imitation. But you can rest assure that there's a higher a higher legal system, &gt;&gt; a higher system of justice. I I I tell you when we were children in the Pentecostal church, they called it praying through. But when that burden begins to lift a little bit &gt;&gt; and faith begins to take a hold, we call that praying through. &gt;&gt; But I want you to know it's more than that. When that burden begin to lift and some joy comes and some peace comes in a situation that's got you out of your mind. &gt;&gt; When you feel that, I want you to know it's because there's one above it all who has rendered A just decision &gt;&gt; on your behalf, &gt;&gt; not in any court authority, &gt;&gt; the authority of authorities, &gt;&gt; the power of all powers, &gt;&gt; king of kings and lord OF LORDS, THE CHIEF AND ULTIMATE POTENTATE OF THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE. HE IS ALL AUTHORITY. And when he says enough, &gt;&gt; sometimes he's saying, "Hold on, it's coming. &gt;&gt; That'll do." Have you ever had that sense of peace that says, "Hold on, it'll it'll change." &gt;&gt; Hold on. [snorts] &gt;&gt; That'll do. But once you get that place, that place of faith and you know that you know that you know no you don't know how the details are going to pan out and you don't know how the circumstances are going to bring the ultimate goal into reality but you know that you know that you know that you know THAT YOU KNOW THAT FIVE MINUTES AGO YOU FELT ALL ALONE AND YOU WERE CARRYING THE WEIGHT OF THE BURDEN ALL BY [screaming] YOURSELF AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU HAVE FELT THE STRENGTH OF THE LORD AS HE AS HE PUT HIS SHOULDER UNDERNEATH BENEATH YOUR LOAD, YOUR WEIGHT, YOUR BURDEN, &gt;&gt; and it begin to get lighter. He also has full authority &gt;&gt; to commission you &gt;&gt; to use that explosive power. You do understand that the kingdom operates not by power, &gt;&gt; not by might, &gt;&gt; but by my spirit, &gt;&gt; by my jurisdiction, &gt;&gt; by my breath, &gt;&gt; says the Lord. You've got to have the ability, the might, the strength of the Lord. But if you don't have his authority, if you're not moving in his authority, which is ultimately his government established in the kingdom, &gt;&gt; you will make a big old mess. &gt;&gt; Can you say, do you want to know how many of you want to know Yiddish? Here's a Yiddish word. Polygon. You will make a big old polygon. you will draw attention to yourself instead of the one you're representing. &gt;&gt; It's very important that we know what to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We know how to wield to use the the power that's been given to us.
