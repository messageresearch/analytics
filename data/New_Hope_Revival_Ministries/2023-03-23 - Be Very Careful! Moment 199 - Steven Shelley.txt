Description:
"Be very careful what you say over your children. It’s like we project our fears on our children. We’re not going to do such a thing like that as we come into the fullness of recognizing who we are. And if we realize the effect of our words in the negative we would also begin to discern the power and authority of our words in the positive and we would start speaking those things."
