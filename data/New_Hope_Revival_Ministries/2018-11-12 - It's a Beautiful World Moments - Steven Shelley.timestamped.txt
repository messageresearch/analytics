[0:12] I am a part of the word bride of Jesus
[0:18] Christ and because I have the word of
[0:21] God in me because that is my origin
[0:24] because that is my seed because that is
[0:27] my Genesis because that is my beginnings
[0:30] I am creative by Nature as soon as I
[0:34] become one with him in the spirit I
[0:37] become creative there are many aspects
[0:42] of my life that I have to create I
[0:45] believe we create the atmosphere of our
[0:48] life by how we come into agreement with
[0:51] the Word of God I believe we create the
[0:53] atmosphere of our home by how we come
[0:56] into agreement with the Word of God
[0:57] therefore I believe we could say it's a
[1:00] beautiful world because I'm living in
[1:05] the one I created if your life is not
[1:08] beautiful if you recognize tonight I'm
[1:10] not living in a beautiful world don't
[1:13] don't feel condemned and don't throw up
[1:16] your hands and quit just do what God has
[1:19] given you the authority and the power to
[1:21] do create a better one
