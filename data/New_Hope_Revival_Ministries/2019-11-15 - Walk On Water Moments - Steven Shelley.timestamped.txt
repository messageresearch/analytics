[0:00] keep your eyes on Jesus let me tell you
[0:13] something think of God
[0:14] when the storm come and you can walk on
[0:17] the troubled ways acting like a man you
[0:22] walking like a god because no man can
[0:28] walk on the waters only God can do that
[0:31] and right now God wants us to walk
[0:35] through the water you have been called
[0:40] in the day and the time where the waters
[0:44] gonna get washed and what they are now
[0:46] and God is expecting that's a while
[0:50] somebody helping it don't look at the
[0:53] waves keep your eyes on Jesus the thing
[1:02] that I love about it is that when Peter
[1:04] began to sink once he took his eyes off
[1:07] of God hallelujah he knew who to call
[1:10] home somebody help me here and Jesus
[1:15] didn't have to run to Peter
[1:17] she often time we start looking at the
[1:20] situation's and we're just in the hands
[1:22] reach somebody help me here Jesus just
[1:27] went down and lift him up and the thing
[1:29] that I love about that Jesus didn't go
[1:33] through some scientific
[1:34] explanation telling Teeter how he's
[1:37] walking on the water this is how you do
[1:40] it Peter how old he didn't go do some
[1:43] type of scientific theory Peter said
[1:47] that to you not bid me come and all he
[1:51] said was calm y'all hear me that's all
[1:56] these after you leave there are we've
[2:05] come but we must keep our eyes on Jesus
