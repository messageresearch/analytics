TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] oh [Music] [Music] praise the Lord I'm Pastor Steven Shelly and you're watching the eagle cry I'm coming to you from the sanctuary of the New Hope Revival Center uh we call our ministry New Hope Revival ministries and this is the sanctuary of our church in Smith Station Alabama well I know you're watching all across Europe and Asia even the Middle East or you may be streaming this on on this fine Christian Network right on your computer in North America or South America I don't know where you are but you probably don't know where Smith Station Alabama is it's just a small uh community in Alabama uh we're about an hour and 20 minutes away from Atlanta Georgia one one of the busiest airports in the United States so uh we're not so far out in the wild Wilderness that we can't be found and that we can't get to society we're between two uh fairly large uh areas one is Columbus Georgia and one is the opala Auburn Alabama area two two communities that kind of join together and uh I was raised in Columbus Georgia uh just a few miles from here although we're just across the border in Alabama now and uh I live away from here a couple times once in South Carolina but most of the time I've lived right here in this area and uh it seems like this is where God has planted us we do have a Prayer Ministry in Jerusalem Israel and uh we're there when we can be I travel uh some of you can find information about that on the uh internet on our website that information is given to you on the screen there's all kinds of information about our ministry there some resources that might be a blessing to you so be sure to check that out uh I like to travel I enjoy speaking at conferences and camp meetings around the world but I also like being at home I like preaching to this congregation uh we are on a piece of property here that the Lord is given us we've named this property under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit Eagles Refuge Holiness Campground and uh there we have a couple of buildings here used for prayer prayer chapel and our Sanctuary is here we have an an office here where we send out material all over the world CDs and DVDs and all kinds of good things that would be a blessing to you in your life so you check that out we also receive prayer requests here at our ministry and we take it serious because I believe in the power of prayer I know that Prayer Changes Things and so if you have a prayer request that you'd like to share with us I can assure you that I will pray and I know that others will because we often share them with with folk around here and they pray uh over your needs as well but when I get one when it comes into the website I see it immediately and I begin to pray and uh I just believe and in fact sometime before we ever can answer to say that we're praying they've already written back to say that God is ministered to them and met the need so if we could help you in some way through prayer well that would be a blessing we can't always do what we would like to do for people but there's one thing we can do and that is pray and why don't you commit perhaps to also pray for us that we would continue to do what what God has called us to do and also while you're praying pray for this great Christian Network that God will use this ministry and expand it into the farthest reaches of this world still there are areas that we're not yet reaching but God is giving Vision to the Great Men Who lead these networks he's giving them vision and Direction and making provision and if you can be a part of that provision you feel free to sew into the ministry of these television networks where you're watching this broadcast because I want to see them not only survive but I want to see them expand and you know there's a lot of uh ugliness on the internet and it's being used for evil things but I want to thank God that it's also being used to spread the gospel of the Lord Jesus Jesus Christ in fact some of you are watching this broadcast uh through your network but right on your own computer or perhaps even your smartphone or an iPad or tablet and I want to thank God for that because it's just another great way of getting the message to you wherever you are and that's a privilege and a pleasure to be able to do that we are studying together the spirit and power of Elijah we're looking at the spirit and power of Elijah in the past in the present and in the future and we're trying to examine what it is about the anointing that was on the Prophet Elijah that would be so important and so significant in the mind of God that he would determin not only to send it once but to send it and resend into the Earth and each time the spirit and power of Elijah would show up in the earth it has uh caused a tremendous shift in the realm of the spirit it has moved a lot of things that needed to be moved and it has helped to prepare the hearts of people to receive the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ and I'm excited about that now if we're going to be able to determine those other visitations of the spirit and power of Elijah it would be a good starting place to find out a little bit about the Elijah that we read about in The Book of kings in the scripture but before we do let me remind you of our theme scripture for this study Malachi 4 5 and 6 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse there's something about the spirit and the power of Elijah that would have such a redeeming effect in the earth that it would cancel the need for the smiting of the Earth with a curse did you follow that had it not been for the coming of the spirit and power of Elijah the Earth would have fallen under a tremendous curse and so we know that this anointing was on Elijah it was also on that dear man who received a double portion Elisha it was also on John the Baptist later we're going to look out the possibility that it has come at the end of the Leo Dean Church age and we're believing that it is returning again in a corporate body of people and there will yet be another return uh in in what we have called the two witnesses or the two Olive branches of the Prophet Zachariah those that he spoke about and each time the Earth was positioned evidently for a for a curse the Striking of the earth a judgment upon the Earth but because the spirit and power of Elijah came into the Earth it pushed that curse upon the Earth farther out in in history and so it is coming uh we know by the scripture that there will be a day uh of of judgment upon the Earth we're we're seeing measures of judgments but a lot of times what we're calling judgments now are really acts of Mercy where God is just trying to get our attention to show us that there's never been a more important hour to be sincere before him and sometimes we have to be shaken a little bit the New Testament tells us that everything that can be shaken will be shaken so that God can see which Remains What will remain and what will be shaken off you see there's a lot of of people who follow uh Christianity with a pretense or with a facade you know they put on some kind of um I don't know almost like a mask really because they identify themselves as Christian because they're not wanting to be identified by some other Faith but I'm not talking about just someone who says I was born a Christian this is something that's often said in the far reaches of the earth meaning I was not born this or not born that or born the other I was born a Christian but I want you to know uh from my heart that God doesn't have any grandchildren and so you can't be uh born you can be born into a Christian family but you can't be born a Christian what makes you a Christian is not the family you're born into but what makes you a Christian is to be Christlike and you can't be like Christ without having experienced the power of the holy spirit in your life the regenerative and Redemptive work of the Cross what the blood of Jesus Christ can do for us it not only covers our sin it remits them as though we had never sinned and it does doesn't stop there it sets us free from the power of sin and death that's what the precious blood of Jesus does so that sin no longer has dominion over our lives now that doesn't mean that we might not fail God at some point or that we might not fall into sin it happens but sin does not have dominion over our lives because we have been washed we have been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb when we we fail when we make mistakes when we sin not willfully but we end up in in a sinful situation we just come to God and we say I'm your child I have failed you I have turned my back temporarily uh I've had a a lapse of good judgment and I've done some things that I'm ashamed of I ask you to come in right now and wash me with your blood and forgive me and Lord I need to be free from that I want to make that same mistake again you know you can learn from your mistakes if you'll just take the time to consider who you are the price that has been paid for you and how he must have loved you oh how he must have loved you to pay the price that he did to redeem you to himself no greater love story I don't know of any greater love story than the one I'm talking about right now that God loved you so much came in the likeness of sinful flesh so that he could suffer pay the price shed the token of his blood and then with Grace get that blood to you you know uh that blood went into the ground and and it's not necessary to go and dig that up with a shovel or a spoon and say I need that blood on me but the life that was in that blood is available to you right now and God used uses the vehicle of Grace he uses the vehicle of Grace to transport the life that was in that blood to your life where you are you don't have to go to Jerusalem to come in contact with that blood because Grace is like a truck it brings the blood the power of the blood the life that was in that blood it brings it right to your doorstep if you invite it if you ask him to come with his grace and with his blood and save you and redeem you he can do that oh my if you haven't done that uh don't wait and until I don't know what you would wait on uh um maybe Sunday to get to a church somewhere or till you can call your neighbor don't wait don't put it off call on him right now and there will be a truckload of Grace headed your way to wash you clean to redeem you to set you free I want us to move on in this now I want us to talk about the characteristics of the Elijah that Prophet whose name was Elijah and what uh what characteristics what attributes we can identify in his life so that we can uh examine history and and see perhaps the times that that anointing that spirit and power returned to the Earth and so we can know what to look for also in the future so let's talk about the nature of Elijah his characteristics and I want to say number one he was a man of the Wilderness he wasn't a city slicker do you know what I mean he liked the Wilderness he had communion with God in the wilderness now I admit that when I read the descriptions of Elijah in the book of Kings uh he he was a bit rough around the edges he didn't come in a threepiece suit he didn't come in what we would call Sunday best uh he was often uh living in the mountain in the caves in the wilderness and and we know that but he also was a man who heard from God and in order to hear from God he had to separate himself from the noise of others and that is nothing but the truth life is noisy and life is busy and if you want to hear from God there are times that you might have to make a Wilderness you might have to pull aside now it might not be in the woods it might not be out in the field or in the desert you might have to do it in your own apartment or your own flat or wherever you live you might have to make that your Wilderness you may have to just pull in sometime and and and and you know turn the television off not yet but uh turn the television off and just wait on the Lord read the word pray and worship him you know you don't have to be in church with a band with a piano and guitar to worship God you can worship him right now in your home wherever you are your place of business you can just worship Him and love on him and tell him how much he means to you in your life and God can speak to you there in your in your Solitude I believe the life of Elijah the separation of his life the fact that he lived most of it away from the crowd speaks of intimacy it speaks of the fact that he learned how to slow down and hear from the Lord he pulled away from the hustle and bustle and the clanging of all the other voices to hear the one who is most important and that voice that is most important in our life is not necessarily the loudest Voice or the showest voice but it is the one that is often small and still we read that about Elijah uh that he had this experience with the Lord where God came to him in a still Small Voice we're often looking for God to to come in a demonstration of of earthquake and fire and wind and storms and uh we're we're waiting to hear God speaking in all of that and sometimes all that does is distract us and if we're willing and patient if we're willing to wait around until the noise of the hurricane and the earthquake and the fire has settled down then often times after that comes the still small voice of the Lord Lord giving us instruction giving us encouragement uh lifting us up when we're down and and giving us you know some instruction for what we need to do next while ministering Grace and strength and healing and hope why don't you allow the Lord to minister some hope to you maybe you're facing a hopeless situation you think it appears that way and and maybe you've even confessed that with your mouth I'm hopeless this is hopeless my loved one is hopeless my job situation is hopeless my living arrangements are hopeless but I want you to know that as children of God it is necessary that we take hope that we have hope when there is no reason to hope the Bible calls that hoping against hope and in that moment when all of our circumstances would say huh give up there's no reason to keep going in that moment when we feel most desperate when we are in despair when we're so discouraged and uh you know I've been there I've been there and anyone who has served the Lord for any amount of time has been in that place and and and I'm I'm ashamed I'm ashamed that I've allowed myself to get there but I did and so I've got to make the best of that now that's that's in the past so how I'm making the best of that is to share with you and to let you know I've been there I've been through that moment of Despair and Desperation when it looked like the best thing I could do for everybody around me would be just lay down and wait on the Lord to take me you know wait on God to just or starve to death or whatever because I didn't have the uh the unction the strength to get up and do what needed to be done I mean that's a low place but in that Darkest Hour in that hopeless moment there's something about the what God has placed in US it gets pushed down with all the hopelessness and the discouragement but it it it it doesn't leave us it's there and somehow by the spirit of God we're able to make contact with that little seed of hope that's been planted in us that that that portion of faith that has been swn into our lives and we start pulling ourselves out sometimes it comes by the encouragement of a friend or someone who prays or someone who reaches out to us but quite often in that moment we have isolated ourselves we have separated ourselves from friends we don't really want to hear their encouragement you can get that low that you don't even want to be encouraged and so in that alone moment of isolation uh you you got to reach within and you've got to find that hope that the Lord Jesus has placed in Us by his spirit and you've got to begin to pull yourself out of that pit of despair I'm speaking to someone right now that has everything you need to get out of that pit it's in you right now I want to speak to that part of you and I want to tell you that you are not going down in Ultimate defeat because greater is he that that is in you than he that is in the world you just need a little bit of that spirit and power of Elijah to fall on you you just need some courage restored and some fellowship renewed between you and the one who loves you more than you could ever understand yet you know I believe one day we will understand we will know as we are known and we'll as the old Hymn of the church will understand it better by and by and I think if we should have a question the answer will be there but until that moment we can't really fathom the the depth of his love for us we just have to trust in it and uh there's a song that says I I think this is the way the words go if Grace were an ocean then I'm sinking and you know that's the only ocean you want to sink in you don't want to sink in the ocean of Des spare or in the ocean of of giving up ultimate uh giving up I I can't go on but if Grace is an ocean then that is an ocean that you can sink in that is an ocean that you can be overwhelmed in and you know what I believe that's how his love and grace is it surrounds us even in those moments when Satan does everything he can to break our fellowship with God he's so jealous of you and your walk with God that he does everything he can to make you feel unloved by God or separated from his Fellowship but don't you allow that to happen uh I want you to understand the difference between pulling aside to hear from the Lord and isolating yourselves because of what you're going through it's it's a different situation all together and I don't encourage you to go into the cave when you're depressed I encourage encourage you to go against that and and find someone who can talk to you and who can be a friend to you uh because I believe if you go into the cave or Into the Wilderness in that moment you might be overwhelmed you might face Temptation that you don't seem to be able to find the way around but once you have come through that place of Despair and that place of hopelessness and you want to draw close to the lord it's in that moment that you want to pull away miss a meal you know uh start out if you've never fasted start out with something that you really enjoy eating and say I'm not going to have that you know you could say I'm not going to have sugar I'm going to lay that aside I'm going to I'm going to lay aside dessert I'm going to lay aside whatever it is that you enjoy and and then work your way into a fast uh where you just want to hear the voice of God where you maybe say I'll I'll just have juice I'll just drink some vegetable juice or or however you purpose in your heart I'm not here to tell you how but I do want to give you some practical ideas wait until you're out from under the load of discouragement before you pull it way uh because when Elijah uh was alone in his in his defeated moments uh it caused him some trouble we'll talk about that as we go along but the Bible tells us in one place that Elijah was down by the Brook cherith and we'll talk about that that was in first Kings chapter 17 verse one and that Brook cherith is uh the meaning of that is a place of Separation a place to be stretched a place to be challenged a place to be developed perhaps God's calling you right now to your Brook cherith a separating he's call calling you to hear his voice he's calling you to stretch you a little bit because he wants to pour more of himself into your life and in order to do to do that he has to expand your capacity a little bit for him you know I don't mind being stretched if I know that he's going to fill up that new place in me with himself father I ask you right now as you stretch us as you challenge us I ask that you will fill us us with more of you more love more power more strength I pray right now that in a confused and troubled mind you will bring a sound mind I pray right now for those in hopelessness that you will break them out of the prison of hopelessness and put your finger upon their life in such a manner that Hope Springs up upon them again Hallelujah and that you'll open up a well within them I hear the spirit saying spring up a well and I'm asking that the Lord would allow that well of Grace and strength and power to spring up in you in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ oh my I feel his presence I hope and trust that you do if we can help you contact our ministry thank you for watching the Eagle's cry I'll be back I hope you will God bless you bye-bye for now [Music] [Applause] [Music]
